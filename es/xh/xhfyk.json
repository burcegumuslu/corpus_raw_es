In an ideal setting, they are there to nurture and protect us. What happens when that dynamic is twisted into a power struggle?\nIn today's episode, we examine common signs of dysfunction and ways to put yourself on the path to healing and taking back your power. These tips can apply to just about any toxic relationship, but we are specifically talking about toxic parents.\nCommonSigns:\nBelittling or devaluing - You accomplishments are never good enough.\nCompetition \u2013 Parents pit themselves against their own children\nSabotage \u2013 Parents will often interfere with their children's careers, friendships, or love prospects. Caution is fine, but this goes to the point of preventing their children from having normal, healthy lives.\nKeeping you at a \u201csafe\u201d age - By \"safe,\" I mean they want to keep you in a child-like dependent state. It's easier for them to control you as a five-year old rather than as a thirty-year old.\nGaslighting \u2013 They deny your experience by telling you what you're supposed to want or like saying things like, \"That's not the career you want.\" Unless it's true, then they are gaslighting you. It also comes in the form of denying they said or did the things they actually said or did to make you question your reality.\nRefusing to admit wrongdoing - This one speaks for itself. Somehow no matter how culpable they are, they will turn the blame back on you.\nProjecting \u2013 If they accuse you of anything, it may be a sign that they themselves are guilty of that very thing. If they accuse you of being ungrateful, it means they are ungrateful. If they accuse you of lying, chances are that they are the ones lying.\nThis is not an exhaustive list by any means but are some behaviors to watch out for. If you are a victim of toxic or narcissistic parents, I wish you peace in finding a way past the hurt feelings.\nI am open for coaching in the summer. Need some insight from an objective 3rd party?
