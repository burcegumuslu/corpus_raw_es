Meet Deputy District Attorney Hector Jimenez, who has been with the DA\u2019s Office since 1995.\nHector was born in Guadalajara, Mexico and came to the U.S. when he was 13 years old. Before joining the San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office, he worked in the Sacramento County District Attorney\u2019s Office and before that he represented minors in dependency court.\nHector started at the DA\u2019s Office in the Juvenile Branch, and he is currently assigned to the Public Integrity Unit, in Special Operations, where he investigates and prosecutes conduct of elected officials or matters involving public funds. He also helps with hate crimes and has taken on a few cases from his tenure in the Economic Crimes Division.\nDuring his spare time, Hector coaches high school mock trials, he is involved with the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association, and he enjoys triathlons and spending time with his family.\nWhat inspired you to choose a career in law enforcement/at the DA\u2019s Office?\n\u201cWhen I was in high school, I was inspired by prosecutors during a Law Day event at the courthouse in Santa Ana, CA. They told us their mission was to help people. From that day, I have aspired to be a diligent and caring prosecutor.\u201d\nWhat is your favorite part of the job?\n\u201cI love the people I work with and our mission to serve the people of this state. The successes are very gratifying, and I can\u2019t think of a better group of people to experience the lows with.\u201d\nWhat does Hispanic Heritage Month mean to you? Why is it important?\n\u201cAs an immigrant, it is an interesting concept because I came from a place where the contributions of minorities were not appreciated. I am proud to belong to a community that recognizes the contributions of its diverse population. One of the interesting things about the Hispanic community is that we come in all shapes and colors, we are very diverse, and we contribute to all industries.\u201d", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://danewscenter.com/category/news/", "https://danewscenter.com/category/noticias/?lang=es", "https://danewscenter.com/category/news/", "https://danewscenter.com/category/noticias/?lang=es", "https://danewscenter.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/SanDiegoCountyDistrictAttorney/", "https://www.youtube.com/user/sandiegoda/", "https://twitter.com/SDDistAtty", "https://www.instagram.com/SDDistAtty/", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/DaNewscenter", "https://danewscenter.com/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/", "https://danewscenter.com/video/", "https://danewscenter.com/resources/", "https://danewscenter.com/about-us/", "https://danewscenter.com/contact/", "?s=", "#", "https://danewscenter.com", "https://danewscenter.com/news/meet-deputy-da-hector-jimenez/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/meet-deputy-da-hector-jimenez/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/prison-sentence-for-defendant-who-pushed-man-into-freight-train/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/prison-sentence-for-defendant-who-pushed-man-into-freight-train/", "https://www.sdcda.org/office/meet-da", "https://danewscenter.com/news/no-cost-haircuts-for-families-in-need-at-one-safe-place/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/no-cost-haircuts-for-families-in-need-at-one-safe-place/", "https://www.sdcda.org/office/meet-da", "https://youtu.be/XQLDlP94opE", "https://onesafeplacenorth.org/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/dui-driver-sentenced-to-prison-for-fatal-crash/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/dui-driver-sentenced-to-prison-for-fatal-crash/", "https://www.sdcda.org/office/meet-da", "https://danewscenter.com/news/da-announces-925k-consumer-settlement/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/da-announces-925k-consumer-settlement/", "https://www.sdcda.org/office/meet-da", "https://danewscenter.com/news/da-strongly-opposes-senate-bill-94/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/da-strongly-opposes-senate-bill-94/", "https://www.sdcda.org/office/meet-da", "https://www.sdcda.org/content/mediarelease/2023/SB%2094%20letter.pdf", "https://danewscenter.com/news/cafecito-con-la-comunidad-offers-resources-in-spanish/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/cafecito-con-la-comunidad-offers-resources-in-spanish/", "https://www.sdcda.org/office/meet-da", "https://onesafeplacenorth.org/", "https://youtu.be/JyTnbiJmnus", "https://onesafeplacenorth.org/", "https://danewscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/CAFECITO-CON-LA-COMUNIDAD-FLYER.pdf", "https://danewscenter.com/news/da-provides-new-resource-to-help-prevent-school-violence/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/da-provides-new-resource-to-help-prevent-school-violence/", "https://www.sdcda.org/office/meet-da", "https://www.sdcoe.net/fs/resource-manager/view/119342aa-aac2-4b47-8aeb-8c39d11cea26", "https://www.sdcoe.net/fs/resource-manager/view/9f934508-80f4-47e6-8f09-4b0eb519281e", "http://www.studentsspeakingout.org/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/burglary-ring-defendants-sentenced-for-targeting-san-diego-homes/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/burglary-ring-defendants-sentenced-for-targeting-san-diego-homes/", "https://www.sdcda.org/office/meet-da", "https://danewscenter.com/news/da-reminds-students-to-report-suspected-abuse-in-schools/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/da-reminds-students-to-report-suspected-abuse-in-schools/", "https://www.sdcda.org/office/meet-da", "https://www.sdcda.org/helping/studentsafety/index.html", "https://youtu.be/n4FUxqW8oh0", "https://youtu.be/WsA9IdzW71E", "https://youtu.be/nY7l-lgjIqY", "https://danewscenter.com/category/news/page/2/", "https://danewscenter.com/category/news/page/3/", "https://danewscenter.com/category/news/page/2/", "https://danewscenter.com/category/news/page/28/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/meet-deputy-da-hector-jimenez/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/meet-deputy-da-hector-jimenez/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/prison-sentence-for-defendant-who-pushed-man-into-freight-train/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/prison-sentence-for-defendant-who-pushed-man-into-freight-train/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/no-cost-haircuts-for-families-in-need-at-one-safe-place/", "https://danewscenter.com/news/no-cost-haircuts-for-families-in-need-at-one-safe-place/", "https://www.facebook.com/SanDiegoCountyDistrictAttorney/", "https://www.youtube.com/user/sandiegoda", "https://twitter.com/SDDistAtty", "https://www.instagram.com/SDDistAtty/", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/DaNewscenter", "https://danewscenter.com/privacy-policy/", "https://danewscenter.com/terms-and-conditions/", "https://www.sdcda.org/", "#top"]}
