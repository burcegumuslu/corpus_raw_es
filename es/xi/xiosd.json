Anyone who owns any of these items on January 1, (excluding licensed motor vehicles) must list them with the Tax Department during the month of January each year. If a property tax listing form, also known as an abstract of taxable property, is not received in the mail, please call our office at 910-798-7300 to request one. A 10% late listing penalty will be charged for anyone not listing their required property with the Tax Department before the January 31st deadline. If January 31st falls on a weekend the next business day will be the deadline.\nLicensed Motor Vehicles\nLicensed motor vehicles and trailers are listed automatically when you first register or renew your motor vehicle or trailer registration through the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).\nBusiness Personal Property\nBusiness personal property includes machinery, computer/office equipment, airplanes, unlicensed vehicles, leasehold improvements, leased equipment, supplies, furniture, fixtures, farm equipment, etc. which are used for a business. Listings must be submitted during the month of January to avoid a 10% late listing penalty. However, an extension can be granted until March 15, if the request is made in writing and is postmarked or hand delivered to the Tax Department by January 31st or if January 31st falls on a weekend the first business day following the 31st. Business property statements are mailed to all business' who listed the previous year or for anyone who has requested a form. If you have business personal property, and do not receive a listing form, please call the Info Center at 910-798-7300 and request a form be mailed to you.\nReal Property\nReal property includes any structures or improvements on land including doublewide and single-wide mobile homes on the land of the same owner with it's wheels and axles removed. You do not have to list real property each year only improvements made to the property. Real Property is permanently listed in New Hanover County so you no longer have to list real property each year. However, you must still list improvements made to the property.\nAny improvements made during the previous year must be listed during the regular listing period which is the month of January. If you have made improvements to your property and did not receive an abstract, a form can be requested by calling 910-798-7300 or you can write to the Tax Administrator's office and ask us to list for you. This letter must include your name and mailing address, the address of the property, the type of improvement made and the percentage of work completed as of January 1. Someone from the appraisal office will visit your property and identify improvements which have been made. That information will be entered into the tax data base to calculate a value using the adopted schedule of values in effect for the most recent revaluation.\nThe effective date of our current revaluation is January 1, 2021. Anytime we make a change in your value, you will be notified in writing. If you do not agree with this value, you should contact our Information Center at 910-798-7300 and they will arrange for you to discuss your value with an appraiser. The next revaluation is scheduled to become effective on January 1, 2025.\nYou may appeal your value in any year between January 1 and the adjournment of the Board of Equalization and Review. The Board of Equalization and Review meets between the first Monday in April and the first Monday in May of each year.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#contentarea",
