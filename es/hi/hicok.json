Baker\nThank you for your information about the process of developing treatment and vaccines for the Covid-19. It would be sincerely appreciated if you would continue to issue timely updates giving us your professional opinions as events continue to roll out very quickly every day and I am not sure we can rely on a lot of the mass of questionable data. Thank you very much.\nMiguel A Rodriguez Jr\nThank you for such information. Which is viltal to the human, to know how it would work. Understanding the process. But most importantly is the safely and we\u2019ll being of all human, during this covid-19 crisis, thanks you for the vital information.\nJames Connor\nIt seems that the leading pharmaceuticals that are producing large quantities of Covid 19 vaccine have skipped phase 4 and gone directly to phase 5. The news media would have you believe that large amounts of the vaccine are rolling off the conveyor belts and I don\u2019t believe they have reported FDA approval as of yet. No wonder everyone isn\u2019t getting in line for the vaccine.\nvittal sitaram\nPlease let us know once you have all the answers and recomend the availabality and definite safety especially for older persons. thanks.\nTricia\nDo we know if the vaccine is going to be a one dose or every year vaccine? what is the percentage of people in the clinical trials that had adverse effects? will this vaccine be mandated for all employees?\nHelene Ehrke\nI agree with you 100%. It appears in my opinion they did in fact skip phase 4, by finishing 3 and bypassing 4 but rolling it into Phase 5.\nI and many others I know will NOT be taking \u201cadvantage\u201d of this vaccine at this time. I still have too many questions and a low immune system due to lupus, HTLV I, Ii & III that there is very little information about. (After 30 years, no treatment or cure, when I go for doctors appointments and tell them about my viral blood cancer they look at me like I have an extra eye, and then I need to educate them on what little I know about it) so do you think I\u2019m worried about taking the vaccine especially if they are giving a live one. Which is how you build up an immunity, not for me.\nIt\u2019s too new on the market. Let them work out all the kinks on others.\nDo you really think we are getting the same medicinal vaccine that the president would get, or anyone whom has a big enough bank account.\nIf the manufacturers are so sure of their patent being approved by the FDA snd they are making you sign a document just in case something goes wrong snd by signing it. You are giving up any and all legal recourse against the mfg. etc..,..I don\u2019t think so. This is the start of the end and start of a new beginning if you or I are lucky enough to be here or where ever the beginning will be. ????\nMargaret Williams\nBeing a senior over 65-with a lung condition- how is one place on the list to be qualified to be in line & eligible for the vaccine for first recipients\nAlice Marsh\nI am a senior citizen at the age of 84 and I want to\nsign up for for Covid-19 to be sure I am protected\nI have battled several bouts of cancer and seem to to be doing well but I still think it is important to be covered and to protect myself with your help. I live in Willingboro, NJ\nPlease Reply, Thankyou\nCooper University Health Care\nDear Ms. March,\nYou can make an appointment at the Camden County College Blackwood Campus vaccine site by calling (856) 549-0530 or visiting https://www.camdencounty.com/vaccineregistration\nTo make an appointment at the Burlington County Moorestown Mall vaccine site, please visit https://www.virtua.org/services/covid19-vaccine-info\nThank you.", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "[Para leer en Espa\u00f1ol, por favor haga clic aqu\u00ed](https://blogs.cooperhealth.org/ehealth/2020/11/18/understanding-clinical-trails-and-the-covid-19-vaccine/#espanol)\nRecent public announcements by both Pfizer and Moderna suggest that vaccines for COVID-19 developed by these companies may be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the next several weeks.\nSince the first case of COVID-19 was reported in China almost a year ago, the objective of the global scientific and medical community has been on the development of standard therapeutics to treat the virus as well as a vaccine to provide individuals with immunity.\nMany pharmaceutical companies are making promising progress with their research. It is important to understand how this scientific research is done and how clinical trials work in developing new drugs or vaccines for COVID-19.\nWhy are clinical trials necessary?\nClinical trials are vital to help ensure new treatments and vaccines are safe for humans. They help clinicians determine how much of the product to prescribe and when, what side effects to expect, and which patients will likely benefit the most from the treatment or vaccine. Many drugs and treatments reach clinical trials, but never reach the public because they don\u2019t work or they are harmful. This process reduces the risk of treatments coming to market that are not helpful or that are harmful.\nDuring the pandemic, there was a lot of discussion about using drugs approved for other diseases to treat COVID-19 without clinical trials having shown benefit and safety. Is this a good idea?\n\u201cIn the face of a pandemic as widespread, impactful, and potentially deadly as COVID-19 there was public pressure for physicians to administer medicines for COVID-19 that are approved for other diseases but with unknown benefit or even potential harm,\u201d said R. Phillip Dellinger, MD, MSc, MCCM, Professor of Medicine at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University. \u201cWithout meaningful studies, the medical community has no way of knowing if these medicines worked or not, or even if the patients simply recovered on their own with supportive care. Ideally, all of these unproven medications should be administered as part of a randomized clinical trial, as we do as a matter of routine research practice in normal times. Only then can we evaluate the safety and efficacy of these drugs or interventions.\u201d\nWhy do clinical trials seem to take so long?\nClinical trials involve a series of methodical phases, according to Raquel Nahra, MD, infectious diseases specialist at Cooper. \u201cDifferent vaccines have been developed and are currently enrolling volunteers around the world. The results of those trials are essential as part of management of one the worst public health crises that we have faced in over a 100 years.\u201d\nBelow are the five phases of a clinical trial:\n- Phase 1 is conducted to see how the body processes a vaccine or medication and what effects it has. A very small dose is given to about 10 to 15 people.\n- Phase 2 determines the best dose of the vaccine or medication with the fewest side effects, and is tested in a small group of patients.\n- During Phase 3, the medication or vaccine is tested on a larger group of patients to further assess safety as well as effectiveness. There are currently several potential COVID-19 vaccines in this phase.\n- Phase 4 relies on a successful phase 3. During phase 4, the vaccine or medication is submitted to the FDA for approval.\n- Phase 5 follows approval by the FDA and includes the large-scale manufacturing of the approved vaccine or medication. Regulatory agencies continue to monitor production \u2013 inspecting manufacturing facilities and testing vaccines for potency, safety, and purity.\nAccording to Dr. Nahra, large trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health have already been conducted with the anti-viral drug Remdesivir, and it is currently approved for treatment of COVID-19 as a result. The most critical trial under way is the large-scale phase 3 trial assessing the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines in development.\nComprensi\u00f3n de los Ensayos Cl\u00ednicos y la Vacuna COVID-19\nLos anuncios p\u00fablicos recientes de Pfizer y Moderna sugieren que las vacunas para COVID-19 desarrolladas por estas compa\u00f1\u00edas pueden ser aprobadas por la Administraci\u00f3n de Drogas y Alimentos de los Estados Unidos (FDA) en las pr\u00f3ximas semanas.\nDesde que se inform\u00f3 el primer caso de COVID-19 en China hace casi un a\u00f1o, el objetivo de la comunidad cient\u00edfica y m\u00e9dica mundial ha sido el desarrollo de terapias est\u00e1ndar para tratar el virus, as\u00ed como una vacuna para proporcionar inmunidad a las personas.\nMuchas compa\u00f1\u00edas farmac\u00e9uticas est\u00e1n logrando avances prometedores con sus investigaciones. Es importante comprender c\u00f3mo se realiza esta investigaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica y c\u00f3mo funcionan los ensayos cl\u00ednicos para desarrollar nuevos medicamentos o vacunas para COVID-19.\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 son necesarios los ensayos cl\u00ednicos?\nLos ensayos cl\u00ednicos son vitales para ayudar a garantizar que los nuevos tratamientos y vacunas sean seguros para los humanos. Ayudan a los m\u00e9dicos a determinar qu\u00e9 cantidad de producto recetar y cu\u00e1ndo, qu\u00e9 efectos secundarios esperar y qu\u00e9 pacientes probablemente se beneficiar\u00e1n m\u00e1s del tratamiento o la vacuna. Muchos medicamentos y tratamientos llegan a ensayos cl\u00ednicos, pero nunca llegan al p\u00fablico porque no funcionan o son da\u00f1inos. Este proceso reduce el riesgo de que salgan al mercado tratamientos que no son \u00fatiles o que son perjudiciales.\nDurante la pandemia, hubo mucha discusi\u00f3n sobre el uso de medicamentos aprobados para otras enfermedades para tratar COVID-19 sin que los ensayos cl\u00ednicos hayan demostrado beneficio y seguridad. \u00bfEs esta una buena idea?\n\u201cFrente a una pandemia tan extendida, impactante y potencialmente mortal como el COVID-19, hubo presi\u00f3n p\u00fablica para que los m\u00e9dicos administraran medicamentos para el COVID-19 que est\u00e1n aprobados para otras enfermedades pero con un beneficio desconocido o incluso un da\u00f1o potencial\u201d, dijo R Phillip Dellinger, MD, MSc, MCCM, Profesor de Medicina en la Facultad de Medicina Cooper de la Universidad Rowan. \u201cSin estudios significativos, la comunidad m\u00e9dica no tiene forma de saber si estos medicamentos funcionaron o no, o incluso si los pacientes simplemente se recuperaron por s\u00ed mismos con cuidados de apoyo. Idealmente, todos estos medicamentos no probados deber\u00edan administrarse como parte de un ensayo cl\u00ednico aleatorizado, como lo hacemos como pr\u00e1ctica de investigaci\u00f3n de rutina en tiempos normales. Solo entonces podremos evaluar la seguridad y eficacia de estos medicamentos o intervenciones \u201c.\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 los ensayos cl\u00ednicos parecen tardar tanto?\nLos ensayos cl\u00ednicos implican una serie de fases met\u00f3dicas, seg\u00fan Raquel Nahra, MD, especialista en enfermedades infecciosas de Cooper. \u201cSe han desarrollado diferentes vacunas y actualmente se est\u00e1n inscribiendo voluntarios en todo el mundo. Los resultados de esos ensayos son esenciales como parte de la gesti\u00f3n de una de las peores crisis de salud p\u00fablica que hemos enfrentado en m\u00e1s de 100 a\u00f1os \u201c.\nA continuaci\u00f3n, se muestran las cinco fases de un ensayo cl\u00ednico:\n- Fase 1 se lleva a cabo para ver c\u00f3mo procesa el cuerpo una vacuna o medicamento y qu\u00e9 efectos tiene. Se administra una dosis muy peque\u00f1a a aproximadamente 10 a 15 personas.\n- Fase 2 determina la mejor dosis de la vacuna o el medicamento con la menor cantidad de efectos secundarios y se prueba en un peque\u00f1o grupo de pacientes.\n- Durante Fase 3, el medicamento o la vacuna se prueba en un grupo m\u00e1s grande de pacientes para evaluar a\u00fan m\u00e1s la seguridad y la eficacia. Actualmente hay varias vacunas COVID-19 potenciales en esta fase.\n- Fase 4 se basa en una fase 3 exitosa. Durante la fase 4, la vacuna o el medicamento se env\u00eda a la FDA para su aprobaci\u00f3n.\n- La fase 5 sigue a la aprobaci\u00f3n de la FDA e incluye la fabricaci\u00f3n a gran escala de la vacuna o el medicamento aprobados. Las agencias reguladoras contin\u00faan monitoreando la producci\u00f3n, inspeccionando las instalaciones de fabricaci\u00f3n y probando las vacunas para determinar su potencia, seguridad y pureza.\nSeg\u00fan el Dr. Nahra, ya se han realizado grandes ensayos patrocinados por los Institutos Nacionales de Salud con el medicamento antiviral Remdesivir y, como resultado, actualmente est\u00e1 aprobado para el tratamiento de COVID-19. El ensayo m\u00e1s cr\u00edtico en curso es el ensayo de fase 3 a gran escala que eval\u00faa la eficacia y seguridad de las vacunas COVID-19 en desarrollo.", "language": null, "image":
