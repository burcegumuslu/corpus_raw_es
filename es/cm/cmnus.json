Drink 8 ounces of water and do not take it for more than 15 consecutive days.\nDo you need a colon cleanse?\nOur digestive system is made to expel everything from the body that is toxic and can be harmful to it. Unfortunately, a sedentary lifestyle, stress and an unhealthy diet may disrupt its healthy rhythm.\nNot having a daily bowel movement is one of the first signs, but also:\n- Are you feeling bloated and unable to relieve yourself?\n- Are you experiencing dark stools or traces of blood in it?;\n- Experiencing heartburn, stomach acidity, burping more than or not farting at all for days?,\n- Are you feeling uneasy while sitting or lying down and feeling a pressure building in your stomach;\n- Are you unable to digest for long periods or feeling sick after taking a meal.\nIf you see any or multiple of these signs happening to you, it means you need a colon cleanse. Order this 15 days program and take the first step to boost your digestive health.\nAre there any side effects?\nThe product may lead to strong urges to go for elimination.\nThe experience during the cleanse can depend on factors such as diet, activity level, use of medication or laxatives, excess waste build-up and insufficient water intake, which may lead to feelings of bloating, diarrhea, gassiness, or constipation.\nIncreasing the dosage from 1 to 2 capsules too soon may lead to discomfort for some individuals. Staying hydrated with sufficient water intake is important. Failure to have a bowel movement after the use of a laxative formula may be an indication you have a more serious condition or lack hydration.\nUse during pregnancy, breastfeeding or diabetes?\nIt is imperative that you consult with your doctor before taking the Colon Cleanse Detox if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic, or have any other medical condition.\nYou may also like\n4.8/ 5.0\nThis product is rated 4.8 of 5.0 stars.
