So far, their simple and effective use of telehealth services have:\n- Provided early intervention for respiratory illness\n- Maximized patient participation before he or she became critically ill\n- Saved the use of personal protective equipment\n- Reduced complications\n\u201cTelehealth allowed the therapy team to address the multidimensional demands of our patients safely and without delay, potentially mitigating further physical deterioration while also meeting their complex psychosocial needs at a time when there was a finite amount of personal protective equipment (PPE), and therapy protocols for providing direct patient care during a pandemic were evolving,\u201d said co-author, Christopher Villarreal, MOT, OTR, an occupational therapist at Baylor University Medical Center.\nAlthough further research is needed, the team believes its early results underscore the benefit of early therapeutic intervention and the power of telehealth technology to overcome disease barriers and provide critical intervention through virtual means.\nRead the\n[full study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297073/) to learn more about this innovative therapy.\nStudy authors include: Emelia Exum, PT, DPT, GCS, advanced clinical specialist level therapist; Brian L.

Lee, PT, PhD, DPT, Mount Saint Mary\u2019s University; Annie Gumieny, PT, DPT, physical therapist; Christopher Villarreal, MOT, OTR, occupational therapist; and Diane Longnecker, MS, CCC-SLP, BCS-S, advanced clinical specialist.\nWe make it easy.\nHealthcare doesn't have to be difficult.
