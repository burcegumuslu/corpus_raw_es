Why not try to bring them together to address each other and ultimately our world in a more effective way?\"\nAtheists often see scanner images tracking blood flows in brains of meditating monks and nuns lost in prayer as proof that faith is an illusion. Newberg warns against simple conclusions:\n\"If you see a brain scan of a nun who's perceiving God's presence in a room, all it tells you is what was happening in her brain when she perceived God's presence in a room.\n\"It may be just the brain doing it, but it may be the brain being the receiver of spiritual phenomena,\" said Newberg, whose research shows the short prayers most believers say leave little trace on the brain because they are not as intense as meditation.\n\"I'm not trying to say religion is bad or it's not real,\" he added. \"I say people are religious and let's try to understand how it affects them.\"\nNO \"GOD SPOT\"\nAnother notion Newberg debunks is the idea there is a single \"God spot\" in the brain responsible for religious belief: \"It's not like there's a little spiritual spot that lights up every time somebody thinks of God.\"\nInstead, religious experiences fire neurons in several different parts of the brain, just like other events do. Locating them does not explain them, but gives pointers to how these phenomena occur and what they might mean.\nIn their book, Newberg and Waldman sketch out some of the \"God circuits\" in the brain and their effects, especially if trained through meditation as muscles are through exercise.\nMeditation both activates the frontal lobe, which \"creates and integrates all of your ideas about God,\" and calms down the amygdala, the emotional region that can create images of an authoritative deity and fog our logical thinking.\nThe parietal-frontal circuit gives us a sense of the space around us and our place in it. Meditation suppresses this sense, giving rise to a serene feeling of unity with God or the world.\n\"Even 10 to 15 minutes of meditation appear to have significantly positive effects on cognition, relaxation and psychological health,\" the authors declare in the book.\nNewberg, who grew up in a Reform Jewish family and has studied many religions, said his work might help both believers and atheists understand religious feelings, which he said were \"among the most powerful and complex experiences people have.\"\nBut he cautioned against expecting \"neurotheology\" to come up with surprising insights soon: \"As good as our techniques are, they are still incredibly crude. We have a long way to go.\"\nEditing by Paul Casciato\nOur Standards:\n[The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)", "language": null, "image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/global-gateway.html", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/login.html", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216467423-Contact-Reuters", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us", "https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/latestCrisis", "https://www.reuters.com/journalists/tom-heneghan", "https://www.reuters.com/journalists/religion-editor", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "//www.reuters.com/tools/mobile", "//newslink.reuters.com/join/subscribe", "//sales.reuters.com/en/ ", "//www.reuters.com/advertising-guidelines", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#cookies", "//www.reuters.com/terms-of-use", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "javascript:window.OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();", "https://www.reuters.com/info/disclaimer", "https://thomsonreuters.com/copyright/"]}
