Si no tiene una cuenta de MyNortonChart, reg\u00edstrese hoy.\nCOVID-19 bivalent vaccines are now available for all individuals ages 6 months and older. Specific recommendations vary by age group and manufacturer. For most individuals older than 5 years of age, a bivalent booster is recommended for those who have completed a COVID-19 primary series at least two months ago. This new booster is also recommended for individuals who have had one or more boosters in the past, as well as for persons who have recovered from COVID-19 infection. Children younger than age 5 may be eligible for a bivalent vaccine depending on their vaccination history.\nNorton Healthcare currently offers the bivalent vaccine at Norton Prompt Care at Walgreens clinics, Norton Community Medical Associates offices and Norton Children\u2019s Medical Group locations. We continue to offer primary vaccine doses to all persons 6 months and older.\nThe updated, bivalent COVID-19 boosters provide greater protection against the BA.4/BA.5 omicron subvariants which are currently circulating. Please speak with your health care provider if you have questions about the bivalent booster and how it may benefit you or your family.\nDetails of your COVID-19 vaccination history \u2014 including the dates of each vaccine dose \u2014 are available in your Norton MyChart account.", "language": null, "image": "https://nortonchildrens.com/wp-content/uploads/Pediatric-covid-Vaccine.jpg",
