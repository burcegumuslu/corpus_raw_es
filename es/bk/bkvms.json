To get the overall score, we add up all the review scores and divide that total by the number of review scores we received. Guests can also give separate subscores in crucial areas, such as location, cleanliness, staff, comfort, facilities, value, and free WiFi. Guests submit their subscores and their overall scores independently \u2013 there\u2019s no direct link between them.\nYou can review an accommodation that you booked through our platform if you stayed there, or if you got to the property but didn\u2019t actually stay there. To edit a review you\u2019ve already submitted, contact our Customer Service team.\nWe have people and automated systems that specialize in detecting fake reviews submitted to our platform. If we find any, we delete them and, if necessary, take action against whoever is responsible.\nAnyone who spots something suspicious can always report it to our Customer Service team so that our fraud team can investigate.\nIdeally, we'd publish every review we get, positive and negative. However, we won\u2019t display any reviews that include or refer to (among other things):\n- Politically sensitive comments\n- Promotional content\n- Illegal activities\n- Personal or sensitive info (e.g. emails, phone numbers, credit card info)\n- Swear words, sexual references, hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, or references to violence\n- Spam and fake content\n- Animal cruelty\n- Impersonation (i.e. if the writer is claiming to be someone else)\n- Any violation of our review guidelines.\nTo make sure reviews are relevant, we may only accept reviews that are submitted within 3 months of checking out. We may stop showing reviews once they\u2019re 36 months old, or if the accommodation has a change of ownership.\nAn accommodation can reply to a review.\nWhen you see multiple reviews, the most recent ones will be at the top, subject to a few other factors (e.g. language, whether it\u2019s just a rating or contains comments as well, etc.). You can sort and/or filter them by time of year, review score, and more.\nSometimes we show external review scores from other well-known travel websites, but make it clear when we do this.\nGuidelines and Standards for Reviews\nThese guidelines and standards aim to keep the content on Booking.com relevant and family-friendly, without limiting expression or strong opinions. They're also applicable regardless of the comment's tone.\nContributions should be travel related. The most helpful contributions are detailed and help others make better decisions. Please don\u2019t include personal, political, ethical, or religious commentary. Promotional content will be removed and issues concerning Booking.com\u2019s services should be routed to our Customer Service or Accommodation Service teams.\nContributions should be appropriate for a global audience. Please avoid using profanity or attempts to approximate profanity with creative spelling, in any language. Comments and media that include hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, sexually explicit remarks, violence, or the promotion of illegal activity are not permitted.\nAll content should be genuine and unique to the guest. Reviews are most valuable when they are original and unbiased. Your contribution should be yours. Booking.com property partners should not post on behalf of guests or offer incentives in exchange for reviews. Attempts to bring down the rating of a competitor by submitting a negative review will not be tolerated.\nRespect the privacy of others. Booking.com will make an effort to obscure email addresses, telephone numbers, website addresses, social media accounts, and other similar details.\nThe opinions expressed in contributions are those of Booking.com customers and properties, and not of Booking.com. Booking.com does not accept responsibility or liability for any reviews or responses. Booking.com is a distributor (without any obligation to verify) and not a publisher of these comments and responses.\nBy default, reviews are sorted based on the date of the review and on additional criteria to display the most relevant reviews, including but not limited to: your language, reviews with text, and non-anonymous reviews. Additional sorting options might be available (by type of traveler, by score, etc...).\nTranslations disclaimer\nThis service may contain translations powered by Google.
