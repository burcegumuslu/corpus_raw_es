This powerful multivitamin acts as an antioxidant, helping your body fight excess free radicals. It also promotes increased energy levels and supports general health.\nEating healthy and having a balanced diet is what we need to provide the vitamins and minerals our body demands. However, our diets are often not supplying the recommended doses our body needs to work properly and make us feel good and healthy.\nSince vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients our body needs to support human life and health, and some only last a few hours in our system, our scientists created supplements to help our body close the gap between what we need and what we get. Some of the multivitamin supplements on the market today do not even meet the requirement for dietary nutrient intake.\nAOR Advantage\nAOR\u2019s Ortho Core\u2122 is an advanced, complete and superior multivitamin supplement, formulated with more than 45 different nutrients including the most effective forms and doses available of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients.\nOrtho Core\u2122 is a comprehensive, balanced multi-vitamin/mineral supplement.
