Berta was a beloved Indigenous rights and environmental leader whose influence has continued to inspire activists a year later. The Honduran government has yet to charge any of the people behind the murder and a recent [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/28/berta-caceres-honduras-military-intelligence-us-trained-special-forces) [ article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/28/berta-caceres-honduras-military-intelligence-us-trained-special-forces) reports that leaked court documents raise concerns that Berta\u2019s murder \u201cwas an extrajudicial killing planned by military intelligence specialists linked to [Honduras\u2019s] US-trained special forces.\u201d Eight men have been arrested in connection to the murder, three of whom have connections to the military. Two of these men had also been to La Esperanza, the town where Berta lived, several times in the weeks leading up to the attack, and another was the manager of the Agua Zarca hydroelectric dam that Berta had opposed. The Guardian\u2019s legal source is quoted as having said, \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that someone with her high profile, whose campaign had made her a problem for the state, could be murdered without at least implicit authorisation of military high command.\u201d In addition, Gustavo Castro, the sole witness to C\u00e1ceres\u2019 murder, remains in exile and in on February 17, 2017, [another Honduran Indigenous leader and activist](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Another-Indigenous-Leader-Assassinated-in-Honduras-20170218-0002.html) was assassinated. Jos\u00e9 de Los Santos Sevilla, a Tolupan leader and a teacher in La Ceiba was attacked in his home. According to Mayor Alexander Rodr\u00edguez of La Ceiba, the police have launched a full investigation. The Tolupan community have faced years of threats and crimes for taking a stand against illegal logging and mining operations destroying their resources without consent. Sevilla\u2019s death came just two weeks after police arrested a suspect in C\u00e1ceres\u2019 murder in the same region of Honduras.\nC\u00e1ceres\u2019 organization,\n[Consejo C\u00edvico de Organizaciones Populares e Ind\u00edgenas de Honduras (COPINH)]( http://copinhenglish.blogspot.com/p/who-we-are.html) and others are looking to the occasion as an opportunity to celebrate not only C\u00e1ceres\u2019 life and legacy, but also to celebrate the 24 years COPINH has been working to improve the conditions and protect the rights of Lenca communities in four states of western Honduras. COPINH defends Lenca environmental, cultural, economic, social, health, education and Indigenous rights as well as Lenca territory and natural resources. COPINH continues to advocate for confronting patriarchal, capitalist, colonial and racist systems that threaten Indigenous Peoples and have stopped at least 50 logging projects and 10 hydroelectric dams that would have threatened Lenca communities. COPINH was also part of the movement that pressured the Honduran government to ratify ILO Convention 169, which includes the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent.\nCOPINH is calling for an international mobilization for justice for the attacks and\n[Other Worlds](https://otherworldsarepossible.org/berta-lives-copinh-continues), a woman-led education and movement support collaborative has been working to launch Latin American movements and organizations supporting \u201cBerta Vive, COPINH sigue!\u201d On March 2nd, COPINH calls on \u201cthe world to strengthen justice\u2014from your homes, communities, mountains, rivers, spiritual centers, organizations and offices. We'll light a white candle together, accompanied by other natural elements of your choosing: water, seeds, flowers, medicinal herbs or anything else that you want. This will symbolize a political, feminist and spiritual action for Berta's family and the communities of COPINH, to keep demanding justice for Berta C\u00e1ceres' assassination, and to remember her spiritual presence in all of our paths and territories in resistance. Let the candles burn overnight to call for justice for Berta.\u201d\nHere is a list of\n[COPINH actions](https://bertavivecopinhsigue.copinh.org/category/actividades/) taking place in March in cities around the world including Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco. COPINH is also calling for the organization of marches, rallies, and candlelight vigils outside Honduran embassies across the globe on March 2nd. In addition to rallies on March 2nd, COPINH is also calling for supporters to flood social media with a number of hashtags including #JusticeForBerta, #1YearWithoutJustice, and #MarchForBerta. COPINH writes on their website, \u201cIn all of these potential proposed actions, and all others that your creativity gives rise to, let the world shake with the cry of: \u201cBerta lives on, COPINH is strong!\u201d Berta vive, COPINH sigue!\u201d\nFor more information about Berta C\u00e1ceres and COPINH visit copinh.org and find them on Facebook at COPINH and on Twitter @COPINH-Honduras.\nPhoto by Comisi\u00f3n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos.", "language": null, "image": "https://www.culturalsurvival.org/sites/default/files/26169811962_4f700bc353_o.jpg", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["#main-content", "https://www.facebook.com/culturalsurvival", "https://twitter.com/csorg", "https://www.instagram.com/culturalsurvival/", "https://www.threads.net/@culturalsurvival", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLO7mJ4WqfHAVmnfRf_BPsw", "https://soundcloud.com/culturalsurvival", "/news/berta-vive-copinh-sigue", "/es/node/11880", "/es", "/es/donate", "/es/node/2", "", "/es/our-values-and-principles", "/es/strategic-framework", "/es/programmatic-priorities", "/es/la-politica-de-equilibrio-de-genero", "/es/issues", "/es/about/staff", "/es/about/board", "/es/about/annual-reports", "/es/node/13238", "/es/node/4", "/es/grantmaking", "/es/koef", "/es/current-projects/community-media-grants-project", "/es/capacity-building", "/es/programs/community-media/youth-fellowship", "/es/node/13951", "/es/supporting-indigenous-womens-leadership-in-media", "/es/defending-our-human-rights-as-indigenous-women", "/es/programs/advocacy", "https://www.sirgecoalition.org/", "/es/programs/community-media", "/es/reports", "/es/communications", "/es/programs/community-media", "https://derechos.culturalsurvival.org/", "/es/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/back-issues", "/es/latest", "/es/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/back-issues", "/es/taxonomy/term/3538", "/es/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/back-issues", "/es/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/guidelines", "https://www.culturalsurvival.org/es/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/back-issues", "/es/news", "/es/reports", "/es/webinars", "/es/about/annual-reports", "/es/node/5", "/es/donate", "/es/about/internships", "/jobs", "https://bazaar.culturalsurvival.org/", "https://shop.culturalsurvival.org/", "/es/node/13238", "/es/latest", "https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/berta-caceres-vive", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/28/berta-caceres-honduras-military-intelligence-us-trained-special-forces", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/28/berta-caceres-honduras-military-intelligence-us-trained-special-forces", "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Another-Indigenous-Leader-Assassinated-in-Honduras-20170218-0002.html", " http://copinhenglish.blogspot.com/p/who-we-are.html", "https://otherworldsarepossible.org/berta-lives-copinh-continues", "https://bertavivecopinhsigue.copinh.org/category/actividades/", "/news/la-lucha-de-los-garifunas-por-su-territorio", "/es/node/13060", "/news/waiting-justice-garifuna-community-seeks-answers-after-four-members-went-missing-two-years-ago", "/es/news/mas-de-dos-anos-de-la-desaparicion-de-garifunas-continua-la-impunidad", "/news/foreign-investments-are-driving-human-rights-abuses-pollution-and-biodiversity-loss-honduras", "/es/node/13663", "https://secure.actblue.com/donate/masstribeatponkapoag", "/donate", "https://www.facebook.com/culturalsurvival", "https://twitter.com/csorg", "https://www.instagram.com/culturalsurvival/", "https://www.threads.net/@culturalsurvival", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLO7mJ4WqfHAVmnfRf_BPsw", "https://soundcloud.com/culturalsurvival", "/donor-policies"]}
