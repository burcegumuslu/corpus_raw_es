Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a potent strategy for eliminating tumors by harnessing the immune system. However, clinical trials with CAR T cells in solid tumors have encountered significant challenges and have not yet demonstrated convincing evidence of efficacy for a large number of patients. A major bottleneck for the success of CAR T-cell therapy is our inability to monitor the accumulation of the CAR T cells in the tumor with clinical-imaging techniques. To address this, we developed a clinically translatable approach for labeling CAR T cells with iron oxide nanoparticles, which enabled the noninvasive detection of the iron-labeled T cells with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), photoacoustic imaging (PAT), and magnetic particle imaging (MPI). Using a custom-made microfluidics device for T-cell labeling by mechanoporation, we achieved significant nanoparticle uptake in the CAR T cells, while preserving T-cell proliferation, viability, and function. Multimodal MRI, PAT, and MPI demonstrated homing of the T cells to osteosarcomas and off-target sites in animals administered with T cells labeled with the iron oxide nanoparticles, while T cells were not visualized in animals infused with unlabeled cells. This study details the successful labeling of CAR T cells with ferumoxytol, thereby paving the way for monitoring CAR T cells in solid tumors.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1073/pnas.2102363119](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102363119)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 35101971](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35101971)\nPURPOSE: To generate diagnostic 18F-FDG PET images of pediatric cancer patients from ultra-low-dose 18F-FDG PET input images, using a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm.METHODS: We used whole-body 18F-FDG-PET/MRI scans of 33 children and young adults with lymphoma (3-30years) to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN), which combines inputs from simulated 6.25% ultra-low-dose 18F-FDG PET scans and simultaneously acquired MRI scans to produce a standard-dose 18F-FDG PET scan. The image quality of ultra-low-dose PET scans, AI-augmented PET scans, and clinical standard PET scans was evaluated by traditional metrics in computer vision and by expert radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians, using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and weighted kappa statistics.RESULTS: The peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index were significantly higher, and the normalized root-mean-square error was significantly lower on the AI-reconstructed PET images compared to simulated 6.25% dose images (p<0.001). Compared to the ground-truth standard-dose PET, SUVmax values of tumors and reference tissues were significantly higher on the simulated 6.25% ultra-low-dose PET scans as a result of image noise. After the CNN augmentation, the SUVmax values were recovered to values similar to the standard-dose PET. Quantitative measures of the readers' diagnostic confidence demonstrated significantly higher agreement between standard clinical scans and AI-reconstructed PET scans (kappa=0.942) than 6.25% dose scans (kappa=0.650).CONCLUSIONS: Our CNN model could generate simulated clinical standard 18F-FDG PET images from ultra-low-dose inputs, while maintaining clinically relevant information in terms of diagnostic accuracy and quantitative SUV measurements.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00259-021-05197-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-021-05197-3)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 33527176](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527176)\nBackground Whole-body diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI can help detect cancer with high sensitivity. However, the assessment of therapy response often requires information about tumor metabolism, which is measured with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Purpose To compare tumor therapy response with whole-body DW MRI and FDG PET/MRI in children and young adults. Materials and Methods In this prospective, nonrandomized multicenter study, 56 children and young adults (31 male and 25 female participants; mean age, 15 years 4 [standard deviation]; age range, 6-22 years) with lymphoma or sarcoma underwent 112 simultaneous whole-body DW MRI and FDG PET/MRI between June 2015 and December 2018 before and after induction chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01542879). The authors measured minimum tumor apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of up to six target lesions and assessed therapy response after induction chemotherapy according to the Lugano classification or PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors. The authors evaluated agreements between whole-body DW MRI- and FDG PET/MRI-based response classifications with Krippendorff statistics. Differences in minimum ADC and maximum SUV between responders and nonresponders and comparison of timing for discordant and concordant response assessments after induction chemotherapy were evaluated with the Wilcoxon test. Results Good agreement existed between treatment response assessments after induction chemotherapy with whole-body DW MRI and FDG PET/MRI ( = 0.88). Clinical response prediction according to maximum SUV (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 100%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 99%, 100%) and minimum ADC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 98%; 95% CI: 94%, 100%) were similar (P = .37). Sensitivity and specificity were 96% (54 of 56 participants; 95% CI: 86%, 99%) and 100% (56 of 56 participants; 95% CI: 54%, 100%), respectively, for DW MRI and 100% (56 of 56 participants; 95% CI: 93%, 100%) and 100% (56 of 56 participants; 95% CI: 54%, 100%) for FDG PET/MRI. In eight of 56 patients who underwent imaging after induction chemotherapy in the early posttreatment phase, chemotherapy-induced changes in tumor metabolism preceded changes in proton diffusion (P = .002). Conclusion Whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI showed significant agreement with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/MRI for treatment response assessment in children and young adults.

Here, we show an intrinsic therapeutic effect of ferumoxytol on the growth of early mammary cancers, and lung cancer metastases in liver and lungs. In vitro, adenocarcinoma cells co-incubated with ferumoxytol and macrophages showed increased caspase-3 activity. Macrophages exposed to ferumoxytol displayed increased mRNA associated with pro-inflammatory Th1-type responses. In vivo, ferumoxytol significantly inhibited growth of subcutaneous adenocarcinomas in mice. In addition, intravenous ferumoxytol treatment before intravenous tumour cell challenge prevented development of liver metastasis. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and histopathology studies showed that the observed tumour growth inhibition was accompanied by increased presence of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in the tumour tissues. Our results suggest that ferumoxytol could be applied 'off label' to protect the liver from metastatic seeds and potentiate macrophage-modulating cancer immunotherapies.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1038/nnano.2016.168](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nnano.2016.168)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 27668795](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27668795)\nImaging tests are essential for staging of children with cancer. However, CT and radiotracer-based imaging procedures are associated with substantial exposure to ionising radiation and risk of secondary cancer development later in life. Our aim was to create a highly effective, clinically feasible, ionising radiation-free staging method based on whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI and the iron supplement ferumoxytol, used off-label as a contrast agent.We compared whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI with standard clinical (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT scans in children and young adults with malignant lymphomas and sarcomas. Whole-body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images were generated by coregistration of colour-encoded ferumoxytol-enhanced whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI scans for tumour detection with ferumoxytol-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans for anatomical orientation, similar to the concept of integrated (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans. Tumour staging results were compared using Cohen's statistics. Histopathology and follow-up imaging served as the standard of reference. Data was assessed in the per-protocol population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01542879.22 of 23 recruited patients were analysed because one patient discontinued before completion of the whole-body scan. Mean exposure to ionising radiation was 125 mSv (SD 41) for (18)F-FDG PET/CT compared with zero for whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI. (18)F-FDG PET/CT detected 163 of 174 malignant lesions at 1325 anatomical regions and whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI detected 158. Comparing (18)F-FDG PET/CT to whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI, sensitivities were 937% (95% CI 890-968) versus 908% (855-947); specificities 977% (95% CI 967-985) versus 995% (989-998); and diagnostic accuracies 972% (936-994) versus 983% (974-992). Tumour staging results showed very good agreement between both imaging modalities with a of 093 (081-100). No adverse events after administration of ferumoxytol were recorded.Ferumoxytol-enhanced whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI could be an alternative to (18)F-FDG PET/CT for staging of children and young adults with cancer that is free of ionising radiation. This new imaging test might help to prevent long-term side-effects from radiographic staging procedures.Thrasher Research Fund and Clinical Health Research Institute at Stanford University.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1016/S1470-2045(14)70021-X](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(14)70021-X)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 24559803](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559803)\nPURPOSES: This study aims to ascertain the prevalence of cavitations in pulmonary metastases among pediatric and young adult patients with sarcoma undergoing tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, and assess whether cavitation can predict clinical response and survival outcomes.METHODS: In a single-center retrospective analysis, we examined chest computed tomography (CT) scans of 17 patients (median age 16years; age range: 4-25years) with histopathologically confirmed bone (n=10) or soft tissue (n=7) sarcoma who underwent TKI treatment for lung metastases. The interval between TKI initiation and the onset of lung nodule cavitation and tumor regrowth were assessed. The combination of all imaging studies and clinical data served as the reference standard for clinical responses. Progression-free survival (PFS) was compared between patients with cavitating and solid nodules using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test.RESULTS: Five out of 17 patients (29%) exhibited cavitation of pulmonary nodules during TKI therapy. The median time from TKI initiation to the first observed cavitation was 79days (range: 46-261days). At the time of cavitation, all patients demonstrated stable disease. When the cavities began to fill with solid tumor, 60% (3/5) of patients exhibited progression in other pulmonary nodules. The median PFS for patients with cavitated pulmonary nodules after TKI treatment (6.7months) was significantly longer compared to patients without cavitated nodules (3.8months; log-rank p-value=.03).CONCLUSIONS: Cavitation of metastatic pulmonary nodules in sarcoma patients undergoing TKI treatment is indicative of non-progressive disease, and significantly correlates with PFS.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1002/pbc.30629](https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.30629)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 37580891](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37580891)\nThe timely diagnosis of primary bone malignancies in pediatric patients is critical to clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the initial presentation of pediatric bone sarcoma patients to an academic health care system and assess the current interval to diagnosis.We conducted a retrospective review of pediatric patients (aged 1-18) with biopsy-proven diagnosis of osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma presenting between 2004 and 2020. All living patients had 1 year or more of follow-up. Primary outcomes were interval to diagnosis, clinical features on initial presentation, percent of patients with negative radiographic workup at initial presentation, and number of health care encounters before diagnosis.Seventy-one patients (osteosarcoma, 51; Ewing sarcoma, 20) were included. Average age at presentation was 13.1 3.3 years (range, 4.4-18.3). Average symptom duration was 5.4 13.9 months (range, 0.1-84). Clinical features at initial presentation included limb/back pain (91.5% of patients), activity modification/pain medication use (78.9%), palpable mass (40.8%), night pain (35.2%), limp (25.4%), limb disuse (18.3%), and recent fever history (2.8%). Fourteen of 71 patients (19.7%) had negative radiographs at initial presentation. Average number of health care encounters before diagnosis was 1.9 0.6 (range, 1.0-4.0), with most in the outpatient pediatrician clinics (81.2%) and emergency department (18.3%). Average time to diagnosis from initial presentation was 19.5 65 days (range, 0-493); the 14 patients with initial negative radiographs had a statistically significant prolonged interval to diagnosis of 54 134 days (range, 0-493; P = 0.018).We found pediatric patients with primary bone sarcoma present with an average interval to diagnosis of 20 days. Twenty percent of patients had a significantly prolonged interval to diagnosis of 54 days. Clinical features suggest night pain is not a sensitive indicator. In patients of appropriate age with persistent unilateral pain in suspicious locations, early advanced imaging with magnetic resonance imaging should be considered.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1097/PEC.0000000000003031](https://doi.org/10.1097/PEC.0000000000003031)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 37567167](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37567167)\nTo compare tumor therapy response assessments with whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging (WB-DWI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET/MRI in pediatric patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.In a retrospective, non-randomized single-center study, we reviewed serial simultaneous WB-DWI and [18F]FDG PET/MRI scans of 45 children and young adults (27 males; mean age, 13years5 [standard deviation]; age range, 1-21years) with Hodgkin lymphoma (n=20) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=25) between February 2018 and October 2022. We measured minimum tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmin) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of up to six target lesions and assessed therapy response according to Lugano criteria and modified criteria for WB-DWI. We evaluated the agreement between WB-DWI- and [18F]FDG PET/MRI-based response classifications with Gwet's agreement coefficient (AC).After induction chemotherapy, 95% (19 of 20) of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and 72% (18 of 25) of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma showed concordant response in tumor metabolism and proton diffusion. We found a high agreement between treatment response assessments on WB-DWI and [18F]FDG PET/MRI (Gwet's AC=0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82, 1.00) in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, and a lower agreement for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Gwet's AC=0.66; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.90). After completion of therapy, there was an excellent agreement between WB-DWI and [18F]FDG PET/MRI response assessments (Gwet's AC=0.97; 95% CI: 0.91, 1).Therapy response of Hodgkin lymphoma can be evaluated with either [18F]FDG PET or WB-DWI, whereas patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma may benefit from a combined approach.Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma exhibit different patterns of tumor response to induction chemotherapy on diffusion-weighted MRI and PET/MRI. Diffusion-weighted imaging has been proposed as an alternative imaging to assess tumor response without ionizing radiation. After induction therapy, whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging and PET/MRI revealed a higher agreement in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma than in those with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. At the end of therapy, whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging and PET/MRI revealed an excellent agreement for overall tumor therapy responses for all lymphoma types.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00330-023-10015-5](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-023-10015-5)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 37542653](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37542653)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID 4461807](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/4461807)\nEpilepsy neuroimaging assessment requires exceptional anatomic detail, physiologic and metabolic information. Magnetic resonance (MR) protocols are often time-consuming necessitating sedation and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) comes with a significant radiation dose. Hybrid PET/MRI protocols allow for exquisite assessment of brain anatomy and structural abnormalities, in addition to metabolic information in a single, convenient imaging session, which limits radiation dose, sedation time, and sedation events. Brain PET/MRI has proven especially useful for accurate localization of epileptogenic zones in pediatric seizure cases, providing critical additional information and guiding surgical decision making in medically refractory cases. Accurate localization of seizure focus is necessary to limit the extent of the surgical resection, preserve healthy brain tissue, and achieve seizure control.

Iron oxide nanoparticles shorten the T1, T2, and T2* relaxation times of tumors. While the T1 effect is variable based on the size and composition of the nanoparticles, the T2 and T2* effects are usually predominant, and T2* measurements are the most time-efficient in a clinical context. Here, we present our approach to measuring tumor T2* relaxation times, using multi-echo gradient echo sequences, external software, and a standardized protocol for creating a T2* map with scanner-independent software. This facilitates the comparison of imaging data from different clinical scanners, different vendors, and co-clinical research work (i.e., tumor T2* data obtained in mouse models and patients). Once the software is installed, the T2 Fit Map plugin needs to be installed from the plugin manager. This protocol provides step-by-step procedural details, from importing the multi-echo gradient echo sequences into the software, to creating color-coded T2* maps and measuring tumor T2* relaxation times. The protocol can be applied to solid tumors in any body part and has been validated based on preclinical imaging data and clinical data in patients. This could facilitate tumor T2* measurements for multi-center clinical trials and improve the standardization and reproducibility of tumor T2* measurements in co-clinical and multi-center data analyses.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.3791/64773](https://doi.org/10.3791/64773)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 37318243](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37318243)\nPreclinical imaging is a critical component in translational research with significant complexities in workflow and site differences in deployment. Importantly, the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) precision medicine initiative emphasizes the use of translational co-clinical oncology models to address the biological and molecular bases of cancer prevention and treatment. The use of oncology models, such as patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), has ushered in an era of co-clinical trials by which preclinical studies can inform clinical trials and protocols, thus bridging the translational divide in cancer research. Similarly, preclinical imaging fills a translational gap as an enabling technology for translational imaging research. Unlike clinical imaging, where equipment manufacturers strive to meet standards in practice at clinical sites, standards are neither fully developed nor implemented in preclinical imaging. This fundamentally limits the collection and reporting of metadata to qualify preclinical imaging studies, thereby hindering open science and impacting the reproducibility of co-clinical imaging research. To begin to address these issues, the NCI co-clinical imaging research program (CIRP) conducted a survey to identify metadata requirements for reproducible quantitative co-clinical imaging. The enclosed consensus-based report summarizes co-clinical imaging metadata information (CIMI) to support quantitative co-clinical imaging research with broad implications for capturing co-clinical data, enabling interoperability and data sharing, as well as potentially leading to updates to the preclinical Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.3390/tomography9030081](https://doi.org/10.3390/tomography9030081)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 37218941](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37218941)\nTo develop a deep learning approach that enables ultra-low-dose, 1% of the standard clinical dosage (3 MBq/kg), ultrafast whole-body PET reconstruction in cancer imaging.In this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study, serial fluorine 18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose PET/MRI scans of pediatric patients with lymphoma were retrospectively collected from two cross-continental medical centers between July 2015 and March 2020. Global similarity between baseline and follow-up scans was used to develop Masked-LMCTrans, a longitudinal multimodality coattentional convolutional neural network (CNN) transformer that provides interaction and joint reasoning between serial PET/MRI scans from the same patient. Image quality of the reconstructed ultra-low-dose PET was evaluated in comparison with a simulated standard 1% PET image. The performance of Masked-LMCTrans was compared with that of CNNs with pure convolution operations (classic U-Net family), and the effect of different CNN encoders on feature representation was assessed. Statistical differences in the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and visual information fidelity (VIF) were assessed by two-sample testing with the Wilcoxon signed rank t test.The study included 21 patients (mean age, 15 years 7 [SD]; 12 female) in the primary cohort and 10 patients (mean age, 13 years 4; six female) in the external test cohort. Masked-LMCTrans-reconstructed follow-up PET images demonstrated significantly less noise and more detailed structure compared with simulated 1% extremely ultra-low-dose PET images. SSIM, PSNR, and VIF were significantly higher for Masked-LMCTrans-reconstructed PET (P < .001), with improvements of 15.8%, 23.4%, and 186%, respectively.Masked-LMCTrans achieved high image quality reconstruction of 1% low-dose whole-body PET images.Keywords: Pediatrics, PET, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Dose Reduction Supplemental material is available for this article.

This has led to increased opportunities to conduct co-clinical trials, which are studies on patients that are carried out parallel to or sequentially with animal models of cancer that mirror the biology of the patients' tumors. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) are considered to be the models that best represent human disease and have high translational value. Notably, one element of co-clinical trials that still needs significant optimization is quantitative imaging. The National Cancer Institute has organized a Co-Clinical Imaging Resource Program (CIRP) network to establish best practices for co-clinical imaging and to optimize translational quantitative imaging methodologies. This overview describes the ten co-clinical trials of investigators from eleven institutions who are currently supported by the CIRP initiative and are members of the Animal Models and Co-clinical Trials (AMCT) Working Group. Each team describes their corresponding clinical trial, type of cancer targeted, rationale for choice of animal models, therapy, and imaging modalities. The strengths and weaknesses of the co-clinical trial design and the challenges encountered are considered. The rich research resources generated by the members of the AMCT Working Group will benefit the broad research community and improve the quality and translational impact of imaging in co-clinical trials.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.3390/tomography9020053](https://doi.org/10.3390/tomography9020053)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 36961012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36961012)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC10037611](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10037611)\nRationale: As a cancer, Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal and difficult-to-treat. With the aim of improving therapies to GBM, we developed novel and target-specific theranostic nanoparticles (TNPs) that can be selectively cleaved by cathepsin B (Cat B) to release the potent toxin monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Methods: We synthesized TNPs composed of a ferumoxytol-based nanoparticle carrier and a peptide prodrug with a Cat-B-responsive linker and the tubulin inhibitor MMAE. We hypothesized that intratumoral Cat B can cleave our TNPs and release MMAE to kill GBM cells. The ferumoxytol core enables in vivo drug tracking with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We incubated U87-MG GBM cells with TNPs or ferumoxytol and evaluated the TNP content in the cells with transmission electron microscopy and Prussian blue staining. In addition, we stereotaxically implanted 6- to 8-week-old nude mice with U87-MG with U87-MG GBM cells that express a fusion protein of Green Fluorescence Protein and firefly Luciferase (U87-MG/GFP-fLuc). We then treated the animals with an intravenous dose of TNPs (25 mg/kg of ferumoxytol, 0.3 mg/kg of MMAE) or control. We also evaluated the combination of TNP treatment with radiation therapy. We performed MRI before and after TNP injection. We compared the results for tumor and normal brain tissue between the TNP and control groups. We also monitored tumor growth for a period of 21 days. Results: We successfully synthesized TNPs with a hydrodynamic size of 41 5 nm and a zeta potential of 6 3 mV. TNP-treated cells demonstrated a significantly higher iron content than ferumoxytol-treated cells (98 1% vs. 3 1% of cells were iron-positive, respectively). We also found significantly fewer live attached cells in the TNP-treated group (3.8 2.0 px2) than in the ferumoxytol-treated group (80.0 14.5 px2, p < 0001). In vivo MRI studies demonstrated a decline in the tumor signal after TNP (T2= 28 ms) but not control (T2= 32 ms) injections. When TNP injection was combined with radiation therapy, the tumor signals dropped further (T2 = 24 ms). The combination therapy of radiation therapy and TNPs extended the median survival from 14.5 days for the control group to 45 days for the combination therapy group. Conclusion: The new cleavable TNPs reported in this work accumulate in GBM, cause tumor cell death, and have synergistic effects with radiation therapy.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.7150/thno.79342](https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.79342)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 37064879](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37064879)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC10091873](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10091873)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1148/rycan.220183](https://doi.org/10.1148/rycan.220183)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 36734849](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36734849)\nPurpose To evaluate if ferumoxytol can improve the detection of bone marrow metastases at diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in pediatric and young adult patients with cancer. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of a prospective institutional review board-approved study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01542879), 26 children and young adults (age range: 2-25 years; 18 males) underwent unenhanced or ferumoxytol-enhanced whole-body DW MRI between 2015 and 2020. Two reviewers determined the presence of bone marrow metastases using a Likert scale. One additional reviewer measured signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and tumor-to-bone marrow contrast. Fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and follow-up chest CT, abdominal and pelvic CT, and standard (non-ferumoxytol enhanced) MRI served as the reference standard. Results of different experimental groups were compared using generalized estimation equations, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results The SNR of normal bone marrow was significantly lower at ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI compared with unenhanced MRI at baseline (21.380 19.878 vs 102.621 94.346, respectively; P = .03) and after chemotherapy (20.026 7.664 vs 54.110 48.022, respectively; P = .006). This led to an increased tumor-to-marrow contrast on ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI scans compared with unenhanced MRI scans at baseline (1397.474 938.576 vs 665.364 440.576, respectively; P = .07) and after chemotherapy (1099.205 864.604 vs 500.758 439.975, respectively; P = .007). Accordingly, the sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy for detecting bone marrow metastases were 96% (94 of 98) and 99% (293 of 297), respectively, with the use of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI compared with 83% (106 of 127) and 95% (369 of 390) with the use of unenhanced MRI. Conclusion Use of ferumoxytol helped improve the detection of bone marrow metastases in children and young adults with cancer.

Two nuclear medicine physicians and two radiologists independently assessed presence/absence of tumors in 8 anatomical areas. Sixteen children also performed 2-[18F]FDG PET and WB DW-MRI at follow-up. One radiologist and one nuclear medicine physician revised follow-up scans and collected changes in tumor apparent diffusion (ADC) and standardized uptake values (SUV) before and after therapy in all detectable lesions. 2-[18F]FDG PET results were considered the standard of reference for tumor detection and evaluation of treatment response according to Lugano criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy of WB DW-MRI at baseline were calculated, and the 95% confidence intervals were estimated by using the Clopper-Pearson (exact) method; changes in tumor SUVs and ADC were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test. Agreement between reviewers was assessed with a Cohen's weighted kappa coefficient. Analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.4.RESULTS: Agreement between reviewers was perfect (kappa coefficient=1) for all analyzed regions but spine and neck (kappa coefficient=0.89 and 0.83, respectively) for 2-[18F]FDG PET images, and abdomen and pelvis (kappa coefficient=0.65 and 0.88, respectively) for WB DW-MRI. Sensitivity and specificity were 95.5% and 100% for WB DW-MRI compared to 2-[18F]FDG PET. Pre to post-treatment changes in SUVratio and ADCmean were inversely correlated for all lesions (r: -0.27, p=006) and significantly different between responders and non-responders to chemotherapy (p=0.0006 and p=0003 for SUVratio and ADCmean, respectively).CONCLUSION: Our study showed that WB DW-MRI has similar accuracy to 2-[18F]FDG PET for staging and treatment monitoring of LCH in children. While 2-[18F]FDG PET remains an approved radiological examination for assessing metabolically active disease, WB DW-MRI could be considered as an alternative approach without radiation exposure. The combination of both modalities might have advantages over either approach alone.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00259-023-06122-6](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-023-06122-6)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 36717409](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36717409)\nMonoclonal antibodies directed against insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) have shown activity in patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma. The primary objective of Children's Oncology Group trial AEWS1221 was to determine if the addition of the IGF-1R monoclonal antibody ganitumab to interval-compressed chemotherapy improves event-free survival (EFS) in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic Ewing sarcoma.Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 at enrollment to standard arm (interval-compressed vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide alternating once every 2 weeks with ifosfamide/etoposide = VDC/IE) or to experimental arm (VDC/IE with ganitumab at cycle starts and as monotherapy once every 3 weeks for 6 months after conventional therapy). A planned sample size of 300 patients was projected to provide 81% power to detect an EFS hazard ratio of 0.67 or smaller for the experimental arm compared with the standard arm with a one-sided of .025.Two hundred ninety-eight eligible patients enrolled (148 in standard arm; 150 in experimental arm). The 3-year EFS estimates were 37.4% (95% CI, 29.3 to 45.5) for the standard arm and 39.1% (95% CI, 31.3 to 46.7) for the experimental arm (stratified EFS-event hazard ratio for experimental arm 1.00; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.33; 1-sided, P = .50). The 3-year overall survival estimates were 59.5% (95% CI, 50.8 to 67.3) for the standard arm and 56.7% (95% CI, 48.3 to 64.2) for the experimental arm. More cases of pneumonitis after radiation involving thoracic fields and nominally higher rates of febrile neutropenia and ALT elevation were reported on the experimental arm.Ganitumab added to interval-compressed chemotherapy did not significantly reduce the risk of EFS event in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic Ewing sarcoma, with outcomes similar to prior trials without IGF-1R inhibition or interval compression. The addition of ganitumab may be associated with increased toxicity.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1200/JCO.22.01815](https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.22.01815)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 36669140](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36669140)\nTo provide a holistic and complete comparison of the five most advanced AI models in the augmentation of low-dose 18F-FDG PET data over the entire dose reduction spectrum.In this multicenter study, five AI models were investigated for restoring low-count whole-body PET/MRI, covering convolutional benchmarks - U-Net, enhanced deep super-resolution network (EDSR), generative adversarial network (GAN) - and the most cutting-edge image reconstruction transformer models in computer vision to date - Swin transformer image restoration network (SwinIR) and EDSR-ViT (vision transformer). The models were evaluated against six groups of count levels representing the simulated 75%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, and 1% (extremely ultra-low-count) of the clinical standard 3MBq/kg 18F-FDG dose. The comparisons were performed upon two independent cohorts - (1) a primary cohort from Stanford University and (2) a cross-continental external validation cohort from Tbingen University - in order to ensure the findings are generalizable. A total of 476 original count and simulated low-count whole-body PET/MRI scans were incorporated into this analysis.For low-count PET restoration on the primary cohort, the mean structural similarity index (SSIM) scores for dose 6.25% were 0.898 (95% CI, 0.887-0.910) for EDSR, 0.893 (0.881-0.905) for EDSR-ViT, 0.873 (0.859-0.887) for GAN, 0.885 (0.873-0.898) for U-Net, and 0.910 (0.900-0.920) for SwinIR. In continuation, SwinIR and U-Net's performances were also discreetly evaluated at each simulated radiotracer dose levels. Using the primary Stanford cohort, the mean diagnostic image quality (DIQ; 5-point Likert scale) scores of SwinIR restoration were 5 (SD, 0) for dose 75%, 4.50 (0.535) for dose 50%, 3.75 (0.463) for dose 25%, 3.25 (0.463) for dose 12.5%, 4 (0.926) for dose 6.25%, and 2.5 (0.534) for dose 1%.Compared to low-count PET images, with near-to or nondiagnostic images at higher dose reduction levels (up to 6.25%), both SwinIR and U-Net significantly improve the diagnostic quality of PET images. A radiotracer dose reduction to 1% of the current clinical standard radiotracer dose is out of scope for current AI techniques.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00259-022-06097-w](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-022-06097-w)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 36633614](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36633614)\nRationale: Efficient labeling methods for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are crucial for tracking and understanding their behavior in regenerative medicine applications, particularly in cartilage defects. MegaPro nanoparticles have emerged as a potential alternative to ferumoxytol nanoparticles for this purpose. Methods: In this study, we employed mechanoporation to develop an efficient labeling method for MSCs using MegaPro nanoparticles and compared their effectiveness with ferumoxytol nanoparticles in tracking MSCs and chondrogenic pellets. Pig MSCs were labeled with both nanoparticles using a custom-made microfluidic device, and their characteristics were analyzed using various imaging and spectroscopy techniques. The viability and differentiation capacity of labeled MSCs were also assessed. Labeled MSCs and chondrogenic pellets were implanted into pig knee joints and monitored using MRI and histological analysis. Results: MegaPro-labeled MSCs demonstrated shorter T2 relaxation times, higher iron content, and greater nanoparticle uptake compared to ferumoxytol-labeled MSCs, without significantly affecting their viability and differentiation capacity. Post-implantation, MegaPro-labeled MSCs and chondrogenic pellets displayed a strong hypointense signal on MRI with considerably shorter T2* relaxation times compared to adjacent cartilage. The hypointense signal of both MegaPro- and ferumoxytol-labeled chondrogenic pellets decreased over time. Histological evaluations showed regenerated defect areas and proteoglycan formation with no significant differences between the labeled groups. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that mechanoporation with MegaPro nanoparticles enables efficient MSC labeling without affecting viability or differentiation. MegaPro-labeled cells show enhanced MRI tracking compared to ferumoxytol-labeled cells, emphasizing their potential in clinical stem cell therapies for cartilage defects.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.7150/thno.82620](https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.82620)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 37215574](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37215574)\nOBJECTIVES: Iron oxide nanoparticles have been used to track the accumulation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the only nanoparticle available for clinical applications to date, ferumoxytol, has caused rare but severe anaphylactic reactions. MegaPro nanoparticles (MegaPro-NPs) provide an improved safety profile. We evaluated whether MegaPro-NPs can be applied for in vivo tracking of CAR T cells in a mouse model of glioblastoma multiforme.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We labeled tumor-targeted CD70CAR (8R-70CAR) T cells and non-tumor-targeted controls with MegaPro-NPs, followed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, Prussian blue staining, and cell viability assays. Next, we treated 42 NRG mice bearing U87-MG/eGFP-fLuc glioblastoma multiforme xenografts with MegaPro-NP-labeled/unlabeled CAR T cells or labeled untargeted T cells and performed serial MRI, magnetic particle imaging, and histology studies. The Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to evaluate overall group differences, and the Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare the pairs of groups.RESULTS: MegaPro-NP-labeled CAR T cells demonstrated significantly increased iron uptake compared with unlabeled controls (P < 0.01). Cell viability, activation, and exhaustion markers were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). In vivo, tumor T2* relaxation times were significantly lower after treatment with MegaPro-NP-labeled CAR T cells compared with untargeted T cells (P < 0.01). There is no significant difference in tumor growth inhibition between mice injected with labeled and unlabeled CAR T cells.CONCLUSIONS: MegaPro-NPs can be used for in vivo tracking of CAR T cells. Because MegaPro-NPs recently completed phase II clinical trial investigation as an MRI contrast agent, MegaPro-NP is expected to be applied to track CAR T cells in cancer immunotherapy trials in the near future.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000946](https://doi.org/10.1097/RLI.0000000000000946)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 36729074](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36729074)\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI with b-values of 50s/mm2 and 800s/mm2 for the detection of bone marrow metastases in children and young adults with solid malignancies.METHODS: In an institutional review board-approved prospective study, we performed 51 whole-body DW-MRI scans in 19 children and young adults (14 males, 5 females; age range: 1-25years) with metastasized cancers before (n=19 scans) and after (n=32 scans) chemotherapy. Two readers determined the presence of focal bone marrow lesions in 10 anatomical areas. A third reader measured ADC and SNR of focal lesions and normal marrow. Simultaneously acquired 18F-FDG-PET scans served as the standard of reference. Data of b=50s/mm2 and 800s/mm2 images were compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Inter-reader agreement was evaluated with weighted kappa statistics.RESULTS: The SNR of bone marrow metastases was significantly higher compared to normal bone marrow on b=50s/mm2 (meanSD: 978.4361239.436 vs. 108.881109.813, p<0.001) and b=800s/mm2 DW-MRI (499.638612.721 vs. 86.28089.120; p<0.001). On 30 out of 32 post-treatment DW-MRI scans, reconverted marrow demonstrated low signal with low ADC values (0.385*10-30.168*10-3mm2/s). The same number of metastases (556/588; 94.6%; p>0.99) was detected on b=50s/mm2 and 800s/mm2 images. However, both normal marrow and metastases exhibited low signals on ADC maps, limiting the ability to delineate metastases. The inter-reader agreement was substantial, with a weighted kappa of 0.783 and 0.778, respectively.CONCLUSION: Bone marrow metastases in children and young adults can be equally well detected on b=50s/mm2 and 800s/mm2 images, but ADC values can be misleading.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00256-022-04240-0](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-022-04240-0)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 36441237](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36441237)\nFerumoxytol is an ultrasmall iron oxide nanoparticle, originally approved in 2009 by the FDA for IV treatment of iron deficiency in adults with chronic kidney disease. Subsequently, its off-label use as an MRI contrast agent has increased in clinical practice, particularly in pediatric patients in North America. Unlike conventional MRI contrast agents that are based on the rare earth metal gadolinium [gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs)], ferumoxytol is biodegradable and carries no potential risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. At FDA-approved doses, ferumoxytol demonstrates no long-term tissue retention in patients with intact iron metabolism. Ferumoxytol provides unique MRI properties including long-lasting vascular retention (facilitating high-quality vascular imaging) and retention in reticuloendothelial system tissues, thereby supporting a variety of applications beyond those possible with GBCAs. This Clinical Perspective describes clinical and early translational applications of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI in children and young adults through off-label use for a variety of settings, including vascular, cardiac, and cancer imaging, drawing on the authors' institutional experience. In addition, we describe current preclinical and clinical research advances using ferumoxytol with regard to cellular and molecular imaging, and also as a novel potential cancer therapeutic agent.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.2214/AJR.22.28453](https://doi.org/10.2214/AJR.22.28453)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 36197052](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36197052)\nIntegrated 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can provide \"one stop\" local tumor and whole-body staging in one session, thereby streamlining imaging evaluations and avoiding duplicate anesthesia in young children. 18F-FDG PET/MR scans have the benefit of lower radiation, superior soft tissue contrast, and increased patient convenience compared to 18F-FDG PET/computerized tomography scans.

Porcine bone marrow mesenchymal stromal stem cells (BMSCs) suspended in a fibrin glue scaffold were implanted into 24 full-thickness cartilage defects (5mm o) of the bilateral distal femur of six Gottingen minipigs (n=12 defects in 6 knee joints of 3 immature pigs; age 3.5-4months; n=12 defects in 6 knee joints of 3 mature control pigs; age, 21-28months). All pigs underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 2, 4, 12 (n=24 defects), and 24weeks (n=12 defects). After the last imaging study, pigs were sacrificed, joints explanted and evaluated with VEGF, H&E, van Gieson, Mallory, and Safranin O stains. Results of mature and immature cartilage groups were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Quantitative scores for subchondral edema at 2weeks were correlated with quantitative scores for cartilage repair (MOCART score and ICRS score) at 12weeks as well as Pineda scores at end of the study, using linear regression analysis. On serial MRIs, mature joints demonstrated progressive healing of cartilage defects while immature joints demonstrated incomplete healing and damage of the subchondral bone. The MOCART score at 12weeks was significantly higher for mature joints (79.5837.216) compared to immature joints (30.41610.543, p=0.002). Immature cartilage demonstrated abundant microvessels while mature cartilage did not contain microvessels. Accordingly, cartilage defects in immature joints showed a significantly higher number of disrupted microvessels, subchondral edema, and angiogenesis compared to mature cartilage. Quantitative scores for subchondral edema at 2weeks were negatively correlated with MOCART scores (r=-0.861) and ICRS scores (r=-0.901) at 12weeks and positively correlated with Pineda scores at the end of the study (r=0.782). Injury of epiphyseal blood vessels in immature joints leads to subchondral bone defects and limits cartilage repair after MASI.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1038/s41598-022-15721-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-15721-6)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 35810189](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35810189)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000893739700076](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000893739700076)\nImaging has become an invaluable tool in preclinical research for its capability to non-invasively detect and monitor disease and assess treatment response. With the increased use of preclinical imaging, large volumes of image data are being generated requiring critical data management tools. Due to proprietary issues and continuous technology development, preclinical images, unlike DICOM-based images, are often stored in an unstructured data file in company-specific proprietary formats. This limits the available DICOM-based image management database to be effectively used for preclinical applications. A centralized image registry and management tool is essential for advances in preclinical imaging research. Specifically, such tools may have a high impact in generating large image datasets for the evolving artificial intelligence applications and performing retrospective analyses of previously acquired images. In this study, a web-based server application is developed to address some of these issues. The application is designed to reflect the actual experimentation workflow maintaining detailed records of both individual images and experimental data relevant to specific studies and/or projects. The application also includes a web-based 3D/4D image viewer to easily and quickly view and evaluate images. This paper briefly describes the initial implementation of the web-based application.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.3390/tomography8030117](https://doi.org/10.3390/tomography8030117)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 35736865](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35736865)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s11307-022-01719-z](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11307-022-01719-z)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 35303206](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35303206)\nOBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-enhanced positron emission tomography (2-[18F]FDG-PET) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) for the detection of bone marrow metastases in children and young adults with solid malignancies.METHODS: In this cross-sectional single-center institutional review board-approved study, we investigated twenty-three children and young adults (mean age, 16.8years5.1 [standard deviation]; age range, 7-25years; 16 males, 7 females) with 925 bone marrow metastases who underwent 66 simultaneous 2-[18F]FDG-PET and DW-MRI scans including 23 baseline scans and 43 follow-up scans after chemotherapy between May 2015 and July 2020.

Bone marrow biopsies and follow-up imaging served as the standard of reference.RESULTS: The reviewers detected 884 (884/925, 95.5%) bone marrow metastases on 2-[18F]FDG-PET and 893 (893/925, 96.5%) bone marrow metastases on DW-MRI. We found different \"blind spots\" for 2-[18F]FDG-PET and MRI: 2-[18F]FDG-PET missed subcentimeter lesions while DW-MRI missed lesions in small bones. Sensitivity and specificity were 91.0% and 100% for 18F-FDG-PET, 89.1% and 100.0% for DW-MRI, and 100.0% and 100.0% for combined modalities, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of combined 2-[18F]FDG-PET/MRI (100.0%) was significantly higher compared to either 2-[18F]FDG-PET (96.9%, p<0.001) or DW-MRI (96.3%, p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Both 2-[18F]FDG-PET and DW-MRI can miss bone marrow metastases. The combination of both imaging techniques detected significantly more lesions than either technique alone.KEY POINTS: DW-MRI and 2-[18F]FDG-PET have different strengths and limitations for the detection of bone marrow metastases in children and young adults with solid tumors. Both modalities can miss bone marrow metastases, although the \"blind spot\" of each modality is different. A combined PET/MR imaging approach will achieve maximum sensitivity and specificity for the detection of bone marrow metastases in children with solid tumors.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00330-021-08529-x](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-021-08529-x)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 35099603](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35099603)\nThe disialoganglioside GD2 is overexpressed on several solid tumors, and monoclonal antibodies targeting GD2 have substantially improved outcomes for children with high-risk neuroblastoma. However, approximately 40% of patients with neuroblastoma still relapse, and anti-GD2 has not mediated significant clinical activity in any other GD2+ malignancy. Macrophages are important mediators of anti-tumor immunity, but tumors resist macrophage phagocytosis through expression of the checkpoint molecule CD47, a so-called 'Don't eat me' signal. In this study, we establish potent synergy for the combination of anti-GD2 and anti-CD47 in syngeneic and xenograft mouse models of neuroblastoma, where the combination eradicates tumors, as well as osteosarcoma and small-cell lung cancer, where the combination significantly reduces tumor burden and extends survival. This synergy is driven by two GD2-specific factors that reorient the balance of macrophage activity. Ligation of GD2 on tumor cells (a) causes upregulation of surface calreticulin, a pro-phagocytic 'Eat me' signal that primes cells for removal and (b) interrupts the interaction of GD2 with its newly identified ligand, the inhibitory immunoreceptor Siglec-7. This work credentials the combination of anti-GD2 and anti-CD47 for clinical translation and suggests that CD47 blockade will be most efficacious in combination with monoclonal antibodies that alter additional pro- and anti-phagocytic signals within the tumor microenvironment.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1038/s41591-021-01625-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01625-x)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 35027753](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35027753)\nRegenerative medicine uses the patient own stem cells to regenerate damaged tissues. Molecular imaging techniques are commonly used to image the transplanted cells, either right after surgery or at a later time. However, few techniques are fast or straightforward enough to label cells intraoperatively. Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were harvested from knee joints of minipigs. The cells were labeled with PET contrast agent by flowing mechanoporation using a microfluidic device. While flowing through a series of microchannels, cells are compressed repeatedly by micro-ridges, which open transient pores in their membranes and induce convective transport, intended to facilitate the transport of 68Ga-labeled and lipid-coated mesoporous nanoparticles (MSNs) into the cells. This process enables cells to be labeled in a matter of seconds. Cells labeled with this approach were then implanted into cartilage defects, and the implant was imaged using positron emission tomography (PET) post-surgery. The microfluidic device can efficiently label millions of cells with 68Ga-labeled MSNs in as little as 15min. The method achieved labeling efficiency greater than 5 Bq/cell on average, comparable to 30min-long passive co-incubation with 68Ga-MSNs, but with improved biocompatibility due to the reduced exposure to ionizing radiation. Labeling time could also be accelerated by increasing throughput through more parallel channels. Finally, as a proof of concept, ADSCs were labeled with 68Ga-MSNs and quantitatively assessed using clinical PET/MR in a mock transplant operation in pig knee joints. MSN-assisted mechanoporation is a rapid, effective and straightforward approach to label cells with 68Ga. Given its high efficiency, this labeling method can be used to track small cells populations without significant effects on viability. The system is applicable to a variety of cell tracking studies for cancer therapy, regenerative therapy, and immunotherapy.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1038/s41598-022-06938-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06938-6)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 35194089](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35194089)\nOne important metric of a radiologist's visibility and influence is their ability to participate in discussion within their community. The goal of our study was to compare the participation level of men and women in scientific discussions at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). Eleven volunteers collected participation data by gender in 59 sessions (286 presentations) at the 2018 RSNA meeting. Data was analyzed using a combination of Chi-squared, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank and T-test. Of all RSNA professional attendees at the RSNA, 68% were men and 32% were women. Of the 2869 presentations listed in the program, 65% were presented by men and 35% were presented by women. Of the 286 presentations in our sample, 177 (61.8%) were presented by men and 109 (38.1%) were presented by women. Of these 286 presentations, 81 (63%) were moderated by men and 47 (37%) were moderated by women. From the audience, 190 male attendees participated in 134 question-and-answer (Q&A) sessions following presentations and 58 female attendees participated in 52 Q&A sessions (P<0.001). Female attendees who did participate in Q&A sessions talked for a significantly shorter period of time (mean 7.14 17.7 seconds, median 0) compared to male attendees (28.7 29.6 seconds, median 16; P<0.001). Overall, our findings demonstrate that women participated less than men in the Q&A sessions at RSNA 2018, and talked for a shorter period of time. The fact that women were outnumbered among their male peers may explain the difference in behavior by gender.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0262639](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262639)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 35061813](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35061813)\nPurpose: To investigate if a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) could enable low-dose fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/MRI for correct treatment response assessment of children and young adults with lymphoma.Materials and Methods: In this secondary analysis of prospectively collected data (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01542879), 20 patients with lymphoma (mean age, 16.4 years 6.4 [standard deviation]) underwent 18F-FDG PET/MRI between July 2015 and August 2019 at baseline and after induction chemotherapy. Full-dose 18F-FDG PET data (3 MBq/kg) were simulated to lower 18F-FDG doses based on the percentage of coincidence events (representing simulated 75%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, and 6.25% 18F-FDG dose [hereafter referred to as 75%Sim, 50%Sim, 25%Sim, 12.5%Sim, and 6.25%Sim, respectively]). A U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved CNN was used to augment input simulated low-dose scans to full-dose scans. For each follow-up scan after induction chemotherapy, the standardized uptake value (SUV) response score was calculated as the maximum SUV (SUVmax) of the tumor normalized to the mean liver SUV; tumor response was classified as adequate or inadequate. Sensitivity and specificity in the detection of correct response status were computed using full-dose PET as the reference standard.Results: With decreasing simulated radiotracer doses, tumor SUVmax increased. A dose below 75%Sim of the full dose led to erroneous upstaging of adequate responders to inadequate responders (43% [six of 14 patients] for 75%Sim; 93% [13 of 14 patients] for 50%Sim; and 100% [14 of 14 patients] below 50%Sim; P < .05 for all). CNN-enhanced low-dose PET/MRI scans at 75%Sim and 50%Sim enabled correct response assessments for all patients. Use of the CNN augmentation for assessing adequate and inadequate responses resulted in identical sensitivities (100%) and specificities (100%) between the assessment of 100% full-dose PET, augmented 75%Sim, and augmented 50%Sim images.Conclusion: CNN enhancement of PET/MRI scans may enable 50% 18F-FDG dose reduction with correct treatment response assessment of children and young adults with lymphoma.Keywords: Pediatrics, PET/MRI, Computer Applications Detection/Diagnosis, Lymphoma, Tumor Response, Whole-Body Imaging, Technology AssessmentClinical trial registration no: NCT01542879 Supplemental material is available for this article.

This article reviews clinical applications of 18F-FDG PET/MRI that are relevant for pediatric oncology, with particular attention to the value of PET/MRI for patient management. Early adopters from 4 different institutions share their insights about specific advantages of PET/MRI technology for the assessment of young children with cancer. We discuss how whole-body PET/MRI can be of value in the evaluation of certain anatomic regions, such as soft tissues and bone marrow, as well as specific PET/MRI interpretation hallmarks in pediatric patients. We highlight how whole-body PET/MRI can improve the clinical management of children with lymphoma, sarcoma, and neurofibromatosis, by reducing the number of radiologic examinations needed (and consequently the radiation exposure), without losing diagnostic accuracy. We examine how PET/MRI can help in differentiating malignant tumors versus infectious or inflammatory diseases. Future research directions toward the use of PET/MRI for treatment evaluation of patients undergoing immunotherapy and assessment of different theranostic agents are also briefly explored. Lessons learned from applications in children might also be extended to evaluations of adult patients.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.2967/jnumed.120.259747](https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.120.259747)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 34599010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34599010)\nMost circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays are designed to detect recurrent mutations. Pediatric sarcomas share few recurrent mutations but rather are characterized by translocations and copy number changes. We applied CAncer Personalized Profiling by deep Sequencing (CAPP-Seq) for detection of translocations found in the most common pediatric sarcomas. We also applied ichorCNA to the combined off-target reads from our hybrid capture to simultaneously detect copy number alterations. We analyzed 64 prospectively collected plasma samples from 17 pediatric sarcoma patients. Translocations were detected in the pre-treatment plasma of 13 patients and were confirmed by tumor sequencing in 12 patients. Two of these patients had evidence of complex chromosomal rearrangements in their ctDNA. We also detected copy number changes in the pre-treatment plasma of 7 patients. We found that ctDNA levels correlated with metastatic status and clinical response. Furthermore, we detected rising ctDNA levels before relapse was clinically apparent, demonstrating the high sensitivity of our assay. This assay can be utilized for simultaneous detection of translocations and copy number alterations in the plasma of pediatric sarcoma patients. While we describe our experience in pediatric sarcomas, this approach can be applied to other tumors that are driven by structural variants.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0987](https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0987)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 34353895](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34353895)\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a WHO grade IV glioma and the most common malignant, primary brain tumor with a 5-year survival of 7.2%. Its highly infiltrative nature, genetic heterogeneity, and protection by the blood brain barrier (BBB) have posed great treatment challenges. The standard treatment for GBMs is surgical resection followed by chemoradiotherapy. The robust DNA repair and self-renewing capabilities of glioblastoma cells and glioma initiating cells (GICs), respectively, promote resistance against all current treatment modalities. Thus, durable GBM management will require the invention of innovative treatment strategies. In this review, we will describe biological and molecular targets for GBM therapy, the current status of pharmacologic therapy, prominent mechanisms of resistance, and new treatment approaches. To date, medical imaging is primarily used to determine the location, size and macroscopic morphology of GBM before, during, and after therapy. In the future, molecular and cellular imaging approaches will more dynamically monitor the expression of molecular targets and/or immune responses in the tumor, thereby enabling more immediate adaptation of tumor-tailored, targeted therapies.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105780](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105780)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 34302977](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34302977)\nBACKGROUND: Oligometastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is potentially curable and demands individualised strategies.METHODS: This single-centre retrospective study investigated if positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MR) had a clinical impact on oligometastatic CRC relative to the standard of care imaging (SCI). Adult patients with oligometastatic CRC on SCI who also underwent PET/MR between 3/2016 and 3/2019 were included. The exclusion criterion was lack of confirmatory standard of reference, either surgical pathology, intraoperative gross confirmation or imaging follow-up. SCI consisted of contrast-enhanced (CE) computed tomography (CT) of the chest/abdomen/pelvis, abdominal/pelvic CE-MR, and/or CE whole-body PET/CT with diagnostic quality (i.e. standard radiation dose) CT. Follow-up was evaluated until 3/2020.RESULTS: Thirty-one patients constituted the cohort, 16 (52%) male, median patient age was 53 years (interquartile range: 49-65 years). PET/MR and SCI results were divergent in 19% (95% CI 9-37%) of the cases, with PET/MR leading to management changes in all of them. The diagnostic accuracy of PET/MR was 905%, versus 718% for SCI. In a pairwise analysis, PET/MR outperformed SCI when compared to the reference standard (p=0.0412).CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the potential usefulness of PET/MR in the management of oligometastatic CRC.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1038/s41416-021-01494-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-021-01494-8)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 34282295](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282295)\nMales and females have physiological, hormonal, and genetic differences that can cause different responses to medicinal treatments.

Currently, children with a newly diagnosed cancer must undergo a series of imaging tests, which are stressful, time-consuming, partially redundant, expensive, and can require repetitive anesthesia. New approaches for pediatric cancer staging can evaluate the primary tumor and metastases in a single session. However, traditional one-stop imaging tests, such as CT and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, are associated with considerable radiation exposure. This is particularly concerning for children because they are more sensitive to ionizing radiation than adults and they live long enough to experience secondary cancers later in life. In this review article we discuss child-tailored imaging tests for tumor detection and therapy response assessment - tests that can be obtained with substantially reduced radiation exposure compared to traditional CT and PET/CT scans. This includes diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)/MRI and integrated [F-18]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI scans. While several investigators have compared the value of DWI/MRI and 18F-FDG PET/MRI for staging pediatric cancer, the value of these novel imaging technologies for cancer therapy monitoring has received surprisingly little attention. In this article, we share our experiences and review existing literature on this subject.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00247-021-05076-x](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00247-021-05076-x)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 33929564](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33929564)\nBACKGROUND: The transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into cartilage defects has led to variable cartilage repair outcomes. Previous in vitro studies have shown that ascorbic acid and reduced iron independently can improve the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. However, the combined effect of ascorbic acid and iron supplementation on MSC differentiation has not been investigated.PURPOSE: To investigate the combined in vivo effects of ascorbic acid and a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved iron supplement on MSC-mediated cartilage repair in mature Gottingen minipigs.STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.METHODS: We pretreated bone marrow-derived MSCs with ascorbic acid and the FDA-approved iron supplement ferumoxytol and then transplanted the MSCs into full-thickness cartilage defects in the distal femurs of Gottingen minipigs. Untreated cartilage defects served as negative controls. We evaluated the cartilage repair site with magnetic resonance imaging at 4 and 12 weeks after MSC implantation, followed by histological examination and immunofluorescence staining at 12 weeks.RESULTS: Ascorbic acid plus iron-pretreated MSCs demonstrated a significantly better MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) score (73.8 15.5), better macroscopic cartilage regeneration score according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (8.6 2.0), better Pineda score (2.9 0.8), and larger amount of collagen type II (28,469 21,313) compared with untreated controls (41.3 2.5, 1.8 2.9, 12.8 1.9, and 905 1326, respectively). The obtained scores were also better than scores previously reported in the same animal model for MSC implants without ascorbic acid.CONCLUSION: Pretreatment of MSCs with ascorbic acid and an FDA-approved iron supplement improved the chondrogenesis of MSCs and led to hyaline-like cartilage regeneration in the knee joints of minipigs.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Ascorbic acid and iron supplements are immediately clinically applicable. Thus, these results, in principle, could be translated into clinical applications.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1177/03635465211005754](https://doi.org/10.1177/03635465211005754)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 33872071](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872071)\nBACKGROUND: MR is an important imaging modality for evaluating musculoskeletal malignancies owing to its high soft tissue contrast and its ability to acquire multiparametric information. PET provides quantitative molecular and physiologic information and is a critical tool in the diagnosis and staging of several malignancies. PET/MR, which can take advantage of its constituent modalities, is uniquely suited for evaluating skeletal metastases. We reviewed the current evidence of PET/MR in assessing for skeletal metastases and provided recommendations for its use.METHODS: We searched for the peer reviewed literature related to the usage of PET/MR in the settings of osseous metastases. In addition, expert opinions, practices, and protocols of major research institutions performing research on PET/MR of skeletal metastases were considered.RESULTS: Peer-reviewed published literature was included. Nuclear medicine and radiology experts, including those from 13 major PET/MR centers, shared the gained expertise on PET/MR use for evaluating skeletal metastases and contributed to a consensus expert opinion statement. [18F]-FDG and non [18F]-FDG PET/MR may provide key advantages over PET/CT in the evaluation for osseous metastases in several primary malignancies.CONCLUSION: PET/MR should be considered for staging of malignancies where there is a high likelihood of osseous metastatic disease based on the characteristics of the primary malignancy, hight clinical suspicious and in case, where the presence of osseous metastases will have an impact on patient management. Appropriate choice of tumor-specific radiopharmaceuticals, as well as stringent adherence to PET and MR protocols, should be employed.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00259-021-05198-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-021-05198-2)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 33619599](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619599)\nFerumoxytol nanoparticles are being used clinically for the treatment of anemia and molecular imaging in patients. It is well documented that while most patients tolerate ferumoxytol well, a small percentage of patients (i.e., 0.01%) develop severe allergic reactions. The purpose of our proof-of-concept study was to determine whether patients with or without hypersensitivity reactions have specific protein corona profiles around ferumoxytol nanoparticles. In a retrospective, institutional review board approved pilot study, we enrolled 13 pediatric patients (5 girls, 8 boys, mean age 16.98.2 years) who received a ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and who did (group 1, n=5) or did not (group 2, n=8) develop an allergic reaction. Blood samples of these patients were incubated with ferumoxytol, and the formation of a hard protein corona around ferumoxytol nanoparticles was measured by dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We also performed in vitro immune response analyses to randomly selected coronas from each group. Our results provide preliminary evidence that ex vivo analysis of the biomolecular corona may provide useful and predictive information on the possibility of severe allergic reactions to ferumoxytol nanoparticles. In the future, patients with predisposition of an allergic reaction to ferumoxytol may be diagnosed based on the proteomic patterns of the corona around ferumoxytol in their blood sample.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1116/6.0000755](https://doi.org/10.1116/6.0000755)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 33706522](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33706522)\nThis paper summarizes the 2020 Diversity in Radiology and Molecular Imaging: What We Need to Know Conference, a three-day virtual conference held September 9-11, 2020.

However, several investigators recently reported that rare Earth metals such as gadolinium are deposited in the brain for months or years. This is particularly concerning for children, whose developing brain is more vulnerable to exogenous toxins compared to adults. Therefore, a search is under way for alternative MR imaging biomarkers. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved iron supplement ferumoxytol can solve this unmet clinical need: ferumoxytol consists of iron oxide nanoparticles that can be detected with MRI and provide significant T1- and T2-signal enhancement of vessels and soft tissues. Several investigators including our research group have started to use ferumoxytol off-label as a new contrast agent for MRI. This article reviews the existing literature on the biodistribution of ferumoxytol in children and compares the diagnostic accuracy of ferumoxytol- and gadolinium-chelate-enhanced MRI.

The specificity of standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing joint infiltration is limited. During our MRI evaluations with ferumoxytol nanoparticles of pediatric and young adult patients with bone sarcomas, we observed a surprising marked T1 enhancement of joint and pleural effusions in some patients but not in others.To evaluate if nanoparticle extravasation differed between joints and pleura with and without tumor infiltration.We retrospectively identified 15 pediatric and young adult patients (mean age: 164years) with bone sarcomas who underwent 18 MRI scans at 1h (n=7) or 24h (n=11) after intravenous ferumoxytol infusion. Twelve patients also received a gadolinium-enhanced MRI. We determined tumor invasion into the joint or pleural space based on histology (n=11) and imaging findings (n=4). We compared the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of the joint or pleural fluid for tumors with and without invasion using a Mann-Whitney U test.MRI scans 24h after intravenous ferumoxytol infusion demonstrated a positive T1 enhancement of the effusion in all joints and pleural spaces with tumor infiltration and no joint or pleural space without infiltration. Corresponding SNR (P=0.004) and CNR (P=0.004) values were significantly higher for joints and pleural spaces with tumor infiltration than without. By contrast, unenhanced MRI, gadolinium-enhanced MRI and 1-h post-contrast ferumoxytol MRI did not show any enhancement of the joint or pleural effusion, with or without tumor infiltration.This pilot study suggests that 24-h post-contrast ferumoxytol MRI scans can noninvasively differentiate between joints with and without tumor infiltration.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00247-021-05156-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00247-021-05156-y)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 34410452](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34410452)\nCurrent checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy strategies in glioblastoma are challenged by mechanisms of resistance including an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

The TIM3 experimental conjugate and isotype control were assessed for specificity with immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry in murine cell lines (GL261 glioma and RAW264.7 macrophages). C57BL/6 mice with orthotopically implanted GL261 cells were imaged in vivo over 4days after intravenous TIM3-800CW injection to assess tumor-specific uptake. Cell-specific uptake was then assessed on histologic sections.The experimental TIM3-800CW, but not its isotype control, bound to RAW264.7 macrophages in vitro. Specificity to RAW264.7 macrophages and not GL261 tumor cells was quantitatively confirmed with the corresponding clone of TIM3 on flow cytometry. In vivo fluorescence imaging of the 800CW signal was localized to the intracranial tumor and significantly higher for the TIM3-800CW cohort, relative to non-targeting isotype control, immediately after tail vein injection and for up to 48h after injection. Resected organs of tumor bearing mice showed significantly higher uptake in the liver and spleen. TIM3-800CW was seen to co-stain with CD3 (13%), CD11b (29%), and CD206 (26%).We propose fluorescent imaging of immune cell imaging as a potential strategy for monitoring and localizing immunologically relevant foci in the setting of brain tumors. Alternative markers and target validation will further clarify the temporal relationship of immunosuppressive effector cells throughout glioma resistance.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s11307-021-01667-0](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11307-021-01667-0)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 34846678](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34846678)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1148/radiol.2019192103](https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2019192103)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000503185400038](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000503185400038)\nThe composition of lymph nodes in pediatric patients is different from that in adults. Most notably, normal lymph nodes in children contain less macrophages. Therefore, previously described biodistributions of iron oxide nanoparticles in benign and malignant lymph nodes of adult patients may not apply to children. The purpose of our study was to evaluate if the iron supplement ferumoxytol improves the differentiation of benign and malignant lymph nodes in pediatric cancer patients on 18F-FDG PET/MRI. Methods: We conducted a prospective clinical trial from May 2015 to December 2018 to investigate the value of ferumoxytol nanoparticles for staging of children with cancer with 18F-FDG PET/MRI. Ferumoxytol is an FDA-approved iron supplement for the treatment of anemia and has been used \"off-label\" as an MRI contrast agent in this study. Forty-two children (7-18 years, 29 male, 13 female) received a 18F-FDG PET/MRI at 2 (n=20) or 24 hours (h) (n=22) after intravenous injection of ferumoxytol (dose 5 mg Fe/kg). The morphology of benign and malignant lymph nodes on ferumoxytol-enhanced T2-FSE sequences at 2 and 24 h were compared using a linear regression analysis. In addition, ADCmean-values, SUV-ratio (SUVmax lesion/SUVmean liver) and R2*-relaxation rate of benign and malignant lymph nodes were compared with a Mann-Whitney-U test. The accuracy of different criteria was assessed with a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Follow-up imaging for at least 6 months served as the standard of reference. Results: We examined a total of 613 lymph nodes, of which 464 (75.7%) were benign and 149 (24.3%) were malignant. On ferumoxytol-enhanced T2-FSE images, benign lymph nodes showed a hypointense hilum and hyperintense parenchyma, while malignant lymph nodes showed no discernible hilum. This pattern was not significantly different at 2 h and 24 h postcontrast (p=0.82). Benign and malignant lymph nodes showed significantly different ferumoxytol enhancement patterns, ADCmean values of 1578 and 852 x10-6 mm2/s, mean SUV-ratios of 0.5 and 2.8, and mean R2*-relaxation rate of 127.8 and 84.4 Hertz (Hz), respectively (all p<0.001). The accuracy of ADCmean, SUV-ratio and pattern (area under the curve (AUC): 0.99; 0.98; 0.97, respectively) was not significantly different (p=0.07). Compared to these three parameters, the accuracy of R2* was significantly lower (AUC: 0.93; p=0.001). Conclusion: Lymph nodes in children show different ferumoxytol-enhancement patterns on MRI than previously reported for adult patients. We found high accuracy (>90%) of ADCmean, SUV-ratio, pattern, and R2* measurements for the characterization of benign and malignant lymph nodes in children. Ferumoxytol nanoparticle accumulation at the hilum can be used to diagnose a benign lymph node. In the future, the delivery of clinically applicable nanoparticles to the hilum of benign lymph nodes could be harnessed to deliver theranostic drugs for immune cell priming.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.7150/thno.40606](https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.40606)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000518768400016](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000518768400016)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 32206111](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32206111)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC7069081](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7069081)\nRecent evidence of gadolinium deposition in the brain has raised safety concerns. Iron oxide nanoparticles are re-emerging as promising alternative MR contrast agents, because the iron core can be metabolized. However, long-term follow up studies of the brain after intravenous iron oxide administration have not been reported thus far. In this study, we investigated, if intravenously administered ferumoxytol nanoparticles are deposited in porcine brains. Methods: In an animal care and use committee-approved prospective case-control study, ten Gttingen minipigs received either intravenous ferumoxytol injections at a dose of 5 mg Fe/kg (n=4) or remained untreated (n=6). Nine to twelve months later, pigs were sacrificed and the brains of all pigs underwent ex vivo MRI at 7T with T2 and T2*-weighted sequences. MRI scans were evaluated by measuring R2* values (R2*=1000/T2*) of the bilateral caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus, thalamus, dentate nucleus, and choroid plexus. Pig brains were sectioned and stained with Prussian blue and evaluated for iron deposition using a semiquantitative scoring system. Data of ferumoxytol exposed and unexposed groups were compared with an unpaired t-test and a Mann-Whitney U test. Results: T2 and T2* signal of the different brain regions was not visually different between ferumoxytol exposed and unexposed controls. There were no significant differences in R2* values of the different brain regions in the ferumoxytol exposed group compared to controls (p>0.05). Prussian blue stains of the same brain regions, scored according to a semiquantitative score, were not significantly different either between the ferumoxytol exposed group and unexposed controls (p>0.05). Conclusions: Our study shows that intravenous ferumoxytol doses of 5-10 mg Fe/kg do not lead to iron deposition in the brain of pigs. We suggest iron oxide nanoparticles as a promising alternative for gadolinium-enhanced MRI.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.7150/ntno.46356](https://doi.org/10.7150/ntno.46356)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 32637297](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32637297)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC7332795](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7332795)\nAutologous therapeutic cells are typically harvested and transplanted in one single surgery. This makes it impossible to label them with imaging biomarkers through classical transfection techniques in a laboratory. To solve this problem, we developed a novel microfluidic device, which provides highly efficient labeling of therapeutic cells with imaging biomarkers through mechanoporation. Methods: Studies were performed with a new, custom-designed microfluidic device, which contains ridges, which compress adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) during their device passage. Cell relaxation after compression leads to cell volume exchange for convective transfer of nanoparticles and nanoparticle uptake into the cell. ADSCs were passed through the microfluidic device doped with iron oxide nanoparticles and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). The cellular nanoparticle and radiotracer uptake was evaluated with DAB-Prussian blue, fluorescent microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP). Labeled and unlabeled ADSCs were imaged in vitro as well as ex vivo in pig knee specimen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). T 2 relaxation times and radiotracer signal were compared between labeled and unlabeled cell transplants using Student T-test with p<0.05. Results: We report significant labeling of ADSCs with iron oxide nanoparticles and 18F-FDG within 12+/-3 minutes. Mechanoporation of ADSCs with our microfluidic device led to significant nanoparticle (> 1 pg iron per cell) and 18F-FDG uptake (61 mBq/cell), with a labeling efficiency of 95%. The labeled ADSCs could be detected with MRI and PET imaging technologies: Nanoparticle labeled ADSC demonstrated significantly shorter T 2 relaxation times (24.22.1 ms) compared to unlabeled cells (79.60.8 ms) on MRI (p<0.05) and 18F-FDG labeled ADSC showed significantly higher radiotracer uptake (614.3 9.5 Bq / 1*104 cells) compared to controls (0.0 0.0 Bq/ 1*104 cells) on gamma counting (p<0.05). After implantation of dual-labeled ADSCs into pig knee specimen, the labeled ADSCs revealed significantly shorter T 2 relaxation times (410.6 ms) compared to unlabeled controls (901.8 ms) (p<0.05). Conclusion: The labeling of therapeutic cells with our new microfluidic device does not require any chemical intervention, therefore it is broadly and immediately clinically applicable. Cellular labeling using mechanoporation can improve our understanding of in vivo biodistributions of therapeutic cells and ultimately improve long-term outcomes of therapeutic cell transplants.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.7150/thno.39554](https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.39554)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 32483435](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32483435)\nOBJECTIVES: We compared the value of ferumoxytol (FMX)- and gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRI for assessment of sarcomas in paediatric/adolescent patients and hypothesised that tumour size and morphological features can be equally well assessed with both protocols.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of paediatric/adolescent patients with newly diagnosed bone or soft tissue sarcomas and both pre-treatment FMX- and Gd-MRI scans, which were maximal 4 weeks apart. Both protocols included T1- and T2-weighted sequences. One reader assessed tumour volumes, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of the primary tumour and adjacent tissues and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) ofFMX- and Gd-MRI scans. Additionally, four readers scored FMX- and Gd-MRI scansaccording to15 diagnostic parameters, using a Likert scale. The results were pooled across readers and compared between FMX- and Gd-MRI scans. Statistical methods included multivariate analyses with different models.RESULTS: Twenty-two patients met inclusion criteria (16 males, 6 females; mean age 15.3 5.0). Tumour volume was not significantly different on T1-LAVA (p = 0.721), T1-SE (p = 0.290) and T2-FSE (p = 0.609)sequences. Compared to Gd-MRI, FMX-MRI demonstrated significantly lower tumour SNR on T1-LAVA (p < 0.001), equal tumour SNR on T1-SE (p = 0.104) and T2-FSE (p = 0.305), significantly higher tumour-to-marrow CNR (p < 0.001) on T2-FSE as well as significantly highertumour-to-liver (p = 0.021) and tumour-to-vessel (p = 0.003) CNR on T1-LAVAimages. Peritumoural and marrow oedema enhancedsignificantly more on Gd-MRIcompared to FMX-MRI (p < 0.001/p = 0.002, respectively). Tumour thrombi and neurovascular bundle involvement were assessed with a significantly higher confidence on FMX-MRI (both p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: FMX-MRI provides equal assessment of the extent of bone and soft tissue sarcomas compared to Gd-MRI with improvedtumour delineation and improved evaluation of neurovascular involvement and tumour thrombi. Therefore,FMX-MRI is a possiblealternative to Gd-MRIfor tumour staging in paediatric/adolescent sarcoma patients.KEY POINTS: Ferumoxytol can be used as an alterative to gadolinium chelates for MRI staging ofpaediatric sarcomas. Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI provides equal assessment of tumour size and other diagnostic parameters compared to gadolinium chelate-enhanced MRI. Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI provides improved delineation of sarcomas from bone marrow, liver and vessels compared to gadolinium chelate-enhanced MRI.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00330-019-06569-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-019-06569-y)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 31844962](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31844962)\nTumor associated macrophages (TAM) are key players in the cancer microenvironment. Molecular imaging modalities such as MRI and PET can be used to track and monitor TAM dynamics in tumors non-invasively, based on specific uptake and quantification of MRI-detectable nanoparticles or PET-detectable radiotracers. Particular molecular signatures can be leveraged to target anti-inflammatory TAM, which support tumor growth, and pro-inflammatory TAM, which suppress tumor growth. In addition, TAM-directed imaging probes can be designed to include immune modulating properties, thereby leading to combined diagnostic and therapeutic (theranostic) effects. In this review, we will discuss the complementary role of TAM-directed radiotracers and iron oxide nanoparticles for monitoring cancer immunotherapies with PET and MRI technologies. In addition, we will outline how TAM-directed imaging and therapy is interdependent and can be connected towards improved clinical outcomes.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.7150/thno.37306](https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.37306)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 31695797](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695797)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC6831464](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6831464)\nMachine learning algorithms can help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, selection of personalized therapies and prediction of long-term outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) describes a subset of machine learning that can identify patterns in data and take actions to reach pre-set goals without specific programming. Machine learning tools can help to identify high-risk populations, prescribe personalized screening tests and enrich patient populations that are most likely to benefit from advanced imaging tests. AI algorithms can also help to plan personalized therapies and predict the impact of genomic variations on the sensitivity of normal and tumor tissue to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The two main bottlenecks for successful AI applications in pediatric oncology imaging to date are the needs for large data sets and appropriate computer and memory power. With appropriate data entry and processing power, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can process large amounts of imaging data, clinical data and medical literature in very short periods of time and thereby accelerate literature reviews, correct diagnoses and personalized treatments. This article provides a focused review of emerging AI applications that are relevant for the pediatric oncology imaging community.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00247-019-04360-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00247-019-04360-1)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 31620840](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620840)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1016/j.jacr.2019.04.008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2019.04.008)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000486132000023](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000486132000023)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1002/wnan.1552](https://doi.org/10.1002/wnan.1552)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000471801500004](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000471801500004)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s11307-018-1272-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11307-018-1272-1)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000468363800023](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000468363800023)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s11307-018-1276-x](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11307-018-1276-x)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000468363800009](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000468363800009)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1055/a-0853-2744](https://doi.org/10.1055/a-0853-2744)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000463102800013](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000463102800013)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s11307-018-1218-7](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11307-018-1218-7)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000458989800011](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000458989800011)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1038/s41419-018-1285-3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-018-1285-3)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000472750600004](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000472750600004)\nTumor response assessments on positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans require correct quantification of radiotracer uptake in tumors and normal organs. Historically, MRI scans have been enhanced with gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents, which are now controversial due to brain deposition. Recently, ferumoxytol nanoparticles have been identified as an alternative to Gd-based contrast agents because they provide strong tissue enhancement on MR images but are not deposited in the brain. However, it is not known if the strong T1- and T2-contrast obtained with iron oxide nanoparticles such as ferumoxytol could affect MR-based attenuation correction of PET data. The purpose of our study was to investigate if ferumoxytol administration prior to a 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose [18F]FDG PET/MR scan would change standardized uptake values (SUV) of normal organs.Thirty pediatric patients (6-18years) with malignant tumors underwent [18F]FDG-PET/MR scans (dose 3MBq/kg). Fifteen patients received an intravenous ferumoxytol injection (5mgFe/kg) prior to the [18F]FDG-PET/MR scans (group 1). Fifteen additional age- and sex-matched patients received unenhanced [18F]FDG-PET/MR scans (group 2). For attenuation correction of PET data, we used a Dixon-based gradient echo sequence (TR 4.2ms, TE 1.1, 2.3ms, FA 5), which accounted for soft tissue, lung, fat, and background air. We used a mixed linear effects model to compare the tissue MRI enhancement, quantified as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as well as tissue radiotracer signal, quantified as SUVmean and SUVmax, between group 1 and group 2. Alpha was assumed at 0.05.The MRI enhancement of the blood and solid extra-cerebral organs, quantified as SNR, was significantly higher on ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI scans compared to unenhanced scans (p<0.001). However, SUVmean and SUVmax values, corrected based on the patients' body weight or body surface area, were not significantly different between the two groups (p>0.05).Ferumoxytol administration prior to a [18F]FDG PET/MR scan did not change standardized uptake values (SUV) of solid extra-cerebral organs. This is important, because it allows injection of ferumoxytol contrast prior to a PET/MRI procedure and, thereby, significantly accelerates image acquisition times.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s11307-019-01409-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11307-019-01409-3)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 31325083](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325083)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.7150/ntno.35342](http://dx.doi.org/10.7150/ntno.35342)\nInitiating mechanisms of migraine headache remain poorly understood and a biomarker of migraine does not exist. Inflammation pertaining to the wall of cerebral arteries and brain parenchyma has been suggested to play a role in migraine pathophysiology.We conducted the first experimental human study to investigate macrophage-mediated inflammation as a possible biomarker of migraine.Using ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO)-enhanced 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we investigated the presence of macrophages in cerebral artery walls and in brain parenchyma of patients with migraine without aura. We used the phosphodiesterase-3-inhibitor cilostazol as an experimental migraine trigger, and investigated both patients who received sumatriptan treatment, and patients who did not. To validate our use of USPIO-enhanced MRI, we included a preclinical mouse model with subcutaneous capsaicin injection in the trigeminal V1 area. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT02549898.A total of 28 female patients with migraine without aura underwent a baseline MRI scan, ingested cilostazol, developed a migraine-like attack, and underwent an USPIO-enhanced MRI scan>24 hours after intravenous administration of USPIO. Twelve patients treated their attack with 6 mg s.c. sumatriptan, while the remaining 16 patients received no migraine-specific rescue medication. The preclinical model confirmed that USPIO-enhanced MRI detects macrophage-mediated inflammation. In patients, however, migraine attacks were not associated with increased USPIO signal on the pain side of the head compared to the non-pain side.Our findings suggest that migraine without aura is not associated with macrophage-mediated inflammation specific to the head pain side.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1177/0333102419848122](https://doi.org/10.1177/0333102419848122)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 31104505](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31104505)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.7150/thno.37306](https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.37306)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000489762700017](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000489762700017)\nThe long-term survival of osteosarcoma patients with metastatic or recurrent disease remains dismal and new therapeutic options are urgently needed. The purpose of our study was to compare the efficacy of CD47 mAb plus doxorubicin combination therapy in mouse models of osteosarcoma with CD47 mAb and doxorubicin monotherapy. Forty-eight NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice with intratibial MNNG/HOS tumors received CD47 mAb, doxorubicin, combination therapy or control IgG treatment. Twenty-four mice (n=6 per group) underwent pre- and post-treatment MRI scans with the macrophage marker ferumoxytol, bioluminescence imaging and histological analysis. Tumor ferumoxytol enhancement, tumor flux and tumor TAM density were compared between different groups using a one-way ANOVA. Twenty-four additional NSG mice underwent survival analyses with Kaplan-Meier curves and a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Intratibial osteosarcomas demonstrated significantly stronger ferumoxytol enhancement and significantly increased TAM quantities after CD47 mAb plus doxorubicin combination therapy compared to CD47 mAb (p = 0.02) and doxorubicin monotherapy (p = 0.001). Tumor bearing mice treated with CD47 mAb plus doxorubicin combination therapy demonstrated significantly reduced tumor size and prolonged survival compared to control groups that received CD47 mAb (p = 0.03), doxorubicin monotherapy (p = 0.01) and control IgG (p = 0.001). In conclusion CD47 mAb plus doxorubicin therapy demonstrates an additive therapeutic effect in mouse models of osteosarcomas, which can be monitored with an immediately clinically applicable MRI technique.

In this study, we chose GdVO4 codoped with Eu3+ and Bi3+ as the host material to generate a highly efficient contrast agent (CA) for MRI and long-term luminescence imaging. The new CA emits strong and stable luminescence because of its strong characteristic emissions, resulting from the energy-transfer process from the vanadate groups (VO43-) to the Eu3+ and Bi3+ dopants. Additionally, these NPs provided conspicuous T1 and T2 relaxation time-shortening characteristics, which result in MRI enhancement. GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs were tested on liver tumor-bearing nude mice, and showed improved liver tumor contrast in T2-weighted MR images (T2WI). The dual-modal imaging probe exhibited no cytotoxicity or organ toxicity, reflecting its excellent biocompatibility. Thus, GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ has the potential to be used for bioassays in vitro and liver tumor targeting in vivo.

The NVU consists of endothelial cells, associated blood-brain barrier tight junctions, basal lamina, pericytes, and parenchymal cells, including astrocytes, neurons, and interneurons. Knowledge of the NVU is essential for interpretation of central nervous system physiology and pathology as revealed by conventional and advanced imaging techniques.

Materials and Methods In this prospective study, adults with high-grade gliomas were enrolled between July 2015 and July 2017. Each participant was administered intravenous ferumoxytol (5 mg/kg) and underwent 3.0-T MRI 24 hours later. Two sites in each tumor were selected for intraoperative sampling on the basis of the degree of ferumoxytol-induced signal change. Susceptibility and the relaxation rates R2* (1/T2*) and R2 (1/T2) were obtained by region-of-interest analysis by using the respective postprocessed maps. Each sample was stained with Prussian blue, CD68, CD163, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Pearson correlation and linear mixed models were performed to assess the relationship between imaging measurements and number of 400 magnification high-power fields with iron-containing macrophages. Results Ten adults (four male participants [mean age, 65 years 9 {standard deviation}; age range, 57-74 years] and six female participants [mean age, 53 years 12 years; age range, 32-65 years]; mean age of all participants, 58 years 12 [age range, 32-74 years]) with high-grade gliomas were included. Significant positive correlations were found between susceptibility, R2*, and R2' and the number of high-power fields with CD163-positive (r range, 0.64-0.71; P < .01) and CD68-positive (r range, 0.55-0.57; P value range, .01-.02) iron-containing macrophages. No significant correlation was found between R2 and CD163-positive (r = 0.33; P = .16) and CD68-positive (r = 0.24; P = .32) iron-containing macrophages. Similar significance results were obtained with linear mixed models. At histopathologic analysis, iron particles were found only in macrophages; none was found in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive tumor cells. Conclusion MRI measurements of susceptibility, R2*, and R2' (R2* - R2) obtained after ferumoxytol administration correlate with iron-containing macrophage concentration, and this shows their potential as quantitative imaging markers of macrophages in malignant gliomas.

However, comprehensive techniques to monitor the fate of transplanted stem cells in vivo are lacking. Such strategies would enable corrective interventions at an early stage and greatly benefit the development of more successful tissue regeneration approaches. In this study, we designed and synthesized a dual-modality imaging probe (Feru-AFC) that can simultaneously localize transplanted stem cells and diagnose immune rejection-induced apoptosis at an early stage in vivo. Methods: We used a customized caspase-3 cleavable peptide-dye conjugate to modify the surface of clinically approved ferumoxytol nanoparticles (NPs) to generate the dual-modality imaging probe with fluorescence \"light-up\" feature. We labeled both mouse mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs, matched) and pig mesenchymal stem cells (pMSCs, mismatched) with the probe and transplanted the labeled cells with biocompatible scaffold at the calvarial defects in mice. We then employed intravital microscopy (IVM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the localization, engraftment, and viability of matched and mismatched stem cells, followed by histological analyses to evaluate the results obtained from in vivo studies. Results: The Feru-AFC NPs showed good cellular uptake efficiency in the presence of lipofectin without cytotoxicity to mMSCs and pMSCs. The fluorescence of Feru-AFC NPs was turned on inside apoptotic cells due to the cleavage of peptide by activated caspase-3 and subsequent release of fluorescence dye molecules. Upon transplantation at the calvarial defects in mice, the intense fluorescence from the cleaved Feru-AFC NPs in apoptotic pMSCs was observed with a concomitant decrease in the overall cell number from days 1 to 6. In contrast, the Feru-AFC NP-treated mMSCs exhibited minimum fluorescence and the cell number also remained similar. Furthermore, in vivo MRI of the Feru-AFC NP-treated mMSC and pMSCs transplants could clearly indicate the localization of matched and mismatched cells, respectively. Conclusions: We successfully developed a dual-modality imaging probe for evaluation of the localization and viability of transplanted stem cells in mouse calvarial defects. Using ferumoxytol NPs as the platform, our Feru-AFC NPs are superparamagnetic and display a fluorescence \"light-up\" signature upon exposure to activated caspase-3. The results show that the probe is a promising tool for long-term stem cell tracking through MRI and early diagnosis of immune rejection-induced apoptosis through longitudinal fluorescence imaging.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.7150/ntno.26389](https://dx.doi.org/10.7150/ntno.26389)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 29977742](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29977742)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC6030766](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6030766)\nWhole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an evolving and increasingly powerful imaging tool with a variety of applications in the pediatric patient population. Variability exists among radiology practices in how this MRI tool is used and how it performed.Our objective was to gain an improved understanding of technical and utilization practices in pediatric whole-body MRI across North America by exploring indications for exam performance, determining referral patterns, and assessing technical protocols and procedures.A 19-question survey was generated in Survey Monkey and distributed in 2016 to the Society for Pediatric Radiology membership. The survey asked questions that included practice type, imaging modality preferences for diseases commonly evaluated with whole-body MRI, MRI field strength and sequence selection, and billing practices.Data were obtained from 62 unique responses to the survey, representing 471 physicians. The majority (93%) practice in an academic institution or private practice with academic affiliation and most practices have utilized whole-body MRI for less than 6years. Whole-body MRI is performed in pediatric patients 0 to 18 years of age, and was the preferred imaging modality for diagnosis/staging/follow-up in neurofibromatosis, type 1 (75%), chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) (74%), cancer predisposition syndromes (75%), vasculopathies (50%) and disseminated/multifocal infection (49%). The most commonly utilized sequences are coronal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) (90%), coronal T1 with or without fat saturation (65%), and axial diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (48%). No preference was shown for either 1.5-T or 3-T systems. Wide variability was seen in preference for billing code utilization, though the majority use chest/abdomen/pelvis (57%) or unlisted MRI (37%) codes.Radiology practitioners - represented by the Society for Pediatric Radiology pediatric radiologists - are using whole-body MRI in the imaging care of pediatric patients for a variety of indications. Survey results reveal some variability in exam utilization and technical performance practices among those pediatric radiologists who perform whole-body MRI.\nView details for\n[PubMedID 29721598](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29721598)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000520552700282](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000520552700282)\nThis paper presents a deep-learning-based CADx for the differential diagnosis of embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS) subtypes of rhabdomysarcoma (RMS) solely by analyzing multiparametric MR images. We formulated an automated pipeline that creates a comprehensive representation of tumor by performing a fusion of diffusion-weighted MR scans (DWI) and gadolinium chelate-enhanced T1-weighted MR scans (MRI). Finally, we adapted transfer learning approach where a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network has been fine-tuned based on the fused images for performing classification of the two RMS subtypes. We achieved 85% cross validation prediction accuracy from the fine-tuned deep CNN model. Our system can be exploited to provide a fast, efficient and reproducible diagnosis of RMS subtypes with less human interaction. The framework offers an efficient integration between advanced image processing methods and cutting-edge deep learning techniques which can be extended to deal with other clinical domains that involve multimodal imaging for disease diagnosis.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1016/j.compmedimag.2017.05.002](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compmedimag.2017.05.002)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 28515009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28515009)\nSuperparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles have been intensively studied for the development of contrast agents in MRI[SB1] .

In an IRB-approved single-center prospective clinical trial, 26 pediatric patients and adolescents (age 10-26years) with acute allograft rejection (n=5), non-rejecting allografts (n=13), and normal native kidneys (n=8) underwent multi-echo T2* fast spoiled gradient-echo (FSPGR) MRI after intravenous injection (p.i.) of 5mg Fe/kg ferumoxytol. T2* relaxation times at 4h p.i. (perfusion phase) and more than 20h p.i. (macrophage phase) were compared with biopsy results. The presence of rejection was assessed using the Banff criteria, and the prevalence of macrophages on CD163 immunostains was determined based on a semi-quantitative scoring system. MRI and histology data were compared among patient groups using t tests, analysis of variance, and regression analyses with a significance threshold of p<0.05.At 4h p.i., mean T2* values were 6.61.5ms for native kidneys and 3.9ms for one allograft undergoing acute immune rejection. Surprisingly, at 20-24h p.i., one rejecting allograft showed significantly prolonged T2* relaxation times (37.0ms) compared to native kidneys (6.31.7ms) and non-rejecting allografts (7.60.1ms). Likewise, three additional rejecting allografts showed significantly prolonged T2* relaxation times compared to non-rejecting allografts at later post-contrast time points, 25-97h p.i. (p=0.008). Histological analysis revealed edema and compressed microvessels in biopsies of rejecting allografts. Allografts with and without rejection showed insignificant differences in macrophage content on histopathology (p=0.44).After ferumoxytol administration, renal allografts undergoing acute rejection show prolonged T2* values compared to non-rejecting allografts. Since histology revealed no significant differences in macrophage content, the increasing T2* value is likely due to the combined effect of reduced perfusion and increased edema in rejecting allografts.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s11307-017-1084-8](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11307-017-1084-8)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 28411307](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28411307)\nContrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is a commonly used diagnostic tool.

Materials and Methods Work with human stem cells was approved by the institutional review board and the stem cell research oversight committee, and animal experiments were approved by the administrative panel on laboratory animal care. Nine immunocompetent Sprague-Dawley rats received intravenous injection of ferumoxytol, and 18 Jax C57BL/6-Tg (Csf1r-EGFP-NGFR/FKBP1A/TNFRSF6) 2Bck/J mice received rhodamine-conjugated ferumoxytol. Then, 48 hours later, immune-matched or mismatched stem cells were implanted into osteochondral defects of the knee joints of experimental rats and calvarial defects of Jax mice. All animals underwent serial MR imaging and intravital microscopy (IVM) up to 4 weeks after surgery. Macrophages of Jax C57BL/6-Tg (Csf1r-EGFP-NGFR/FKBP1A/TNFRSF6) 2Bck/J mice express enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP), which enables in vivo correlation of ferumoxytol enhancement at MR imaging with macrophage quantities at IVM. All quantitative data were compared between experimental groups by using a mixed linear model and t tests. Results Immune-mismatched stem cell implants demonstrated stronger ferumoxytol enhancement than did matched stem cell implants. At 4 weeks, T2 values of mismatched implants were significantly lower than those of matched implants in osteochondral defects of female rats (mean, 10.72 msec for human stem cells and 11.55 msec for male rat stem cells vs 15.45 msec for sex-matched rat stem cells; P = .02 and P = .04, respectively) and calvarial defects of recipient mice (mean, 21.7 msec vs 27.1 msec, respectively; P = .0444). This corresponded to increased recruitment of enhanced GFP- and rhodamine-ferumoxytol-positive macrophages into stem cell transplants, as visualized with IVM and histopathologic examination.

Evidence from preclinical tumor models and human trials indicates the role of GBM initiating cells (GIC) in GBM drug resistance. Here, we propose a new treatment option with tumor enzyme-activatable, combined therapeutic and diagnostic (theranostic) nanoparticles, which caused specific toxicity against GBM tumor cells and GICs. The theranostic cross-linked iron oxide nanoparticles (CLIO) were conjugated to a highly potent vascular disrupting agent (ICT) and secured with a matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP-14) cleavable peptide. Treatment with CLIO-ICT disrupted tumor vasculature of MMP-14 expressing GBM, induced GIC apoptosis and significantly impaired tumor growth. In addition, the iron core of CLIO-ICT enabled in vivo drug tracking with MR imaging. Treatment with CLIO-ICT plus temozolomide achieved tumor remission and significantly increased survival of human GBM bearing mice by more than 2 fold compared to treatment with temozolomide alone. Thus, we present a novel therapeutic strategy with significant impact on survival and great potential for clinical translation.\nView details for\n[PubMedID 28659432](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28659432)\nThis commentary summarizes insights and discussions about the status of women leaders in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and medicine). While many academic institutions now train close to 50% female students in STEM disciplines, there is a major underrepresentation of qualified women in leadership roles. Women are admitted to the basements of STEM institutions, but only few make it to the top floor. We see male superstars receiving well-deserved recognitions and advancements. Unfortunately, their female counterparts are often held back or cut down by both male and female colleagues. Increasing reports of acts of discrimination reported by women in STEM fields are a symptom. Unilateral hierarchy is the root cause. Just increasing the quote/proportion of women and underrepresented minorities at an institution is therefore not enough to address the underlying problem. At Stanford Radiology, we started a major initiative to increase the representation of qualified women and other underrepresented minorities in our leadership teams in order to ensure that every member of the Department has an advocate at the leadership table, when decisions are being made.

Materials and Methods Ferumoxytol was incubated in media containing human serum (group 1), fetal bovine serum (group 2), StemPro medium (group 3), protamine (group 4), and protamine plus heparin (group 5). Formation of a protein corona was characterized by means of dynamic light scattering, potential, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Iron uptake was evaluated with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine-Prussian blue staining, lysosomal staining, and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. To evaluate the effect of a protein corona on stem cell labeling, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were labeled with the above formulations, implanted into pig knee specimens, and investigated with T2-weighted fast spin-echo and multiecho spin-echo sequences on a 3.0-T MR imaging unit. Data in different groups were compared by using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Results Compared with bare nanoparticles, all experimental groups showed significantly increased negative values (from -37 to less than -10; P = .008). Nanoparticles in groups 1-3 showed an increased size because of the formation of a protein corona. hMSCs labeled with group 1-5 media showed significantly shortened T2 relaxation times compared with unlabeled control cells (P = .0012). hMSCs labeled with group 3 and 5 media had the highest iron uptake after cells labeled with group 1 medium. After implantation into pig knees, hMSCs labeled with group 1 medium showed significantly shorter T2 relaxation times than hMSCs labeled with group 2-5 media (P = .0022).

Time needed for patient preparation, PET/MR image acquisition, and data processing was compared before (n=5) and after (n=15) time-saving interventions, using a Wilcoxon test. The ferumoxytol-enhanced PET/MR images were compared with clinical standard staging tests regarding radiation exposure and tumor staging results, using Fisher's exact tests.Tailored workflows significantly reduced scan times from 36 to 24min for head to mid thigh scans (p<0.001).

Using the iron supplement ferumoxytol \"off label\" as an MR contrast agent avoided gadolinium chelate administration. The ferumoxytol-enhanced PET/MR scans provided equal or superior tumor staging results compared to clinical standard tests in 17 out of 20 patients. Compared to PET/CT, PET/MR had comparable detection rates for pulmonary nodules with diameters of equal or greater than 5mm (94 vs. 100%), yet detected significantly fewer nodules with diameters of less than 5 mm (20 vs 100%) (p=0.03).

We determined whether bone marrow oedema (BME) is an early sign of progressive ON and eventual bone collapse.In a retrospective study, two radiologists reviewed MR imaging characteristics of 47 early stage epiphyseal ON in 15 paediatric and adolescent leukaemia patients. Associations between BME on initial imaging studies and subchondral fracture, disease progression and bone collapse were assessed by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests. Differences in time to progression and bone collapse between lesions with and without oedema were assessed by log rank tests.Forty-seven occurrences of ON were located in weight bearing joints, with 77% occurring in the femur. Seventeen lesions progressed to collapse, two lesions worsened without collapse, and 28 remained stable or improved. BME was significantly associated with subchondral fracture (p=0.0014), disease progression (p=0.0015), and bone collapse (p<0.001), with a sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 77%, respectively, for bone collapse. Time to progression for ON with oedema was 2.7years (95% CI: 1.7-3.4); while the majority of no-oedema ON were stable (p=0.0011).BME is an early sign of progressive ON and eventual bone collapse in paediatric and adolescent leukaemia patients. Bone marrow oedema in corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis predicts progression to bone collapse. Bone marrow oedema is associated with subchondral fractures in corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis. Bone marrow oedema can be used to stratify patients to joint-preserving interventions.

Materials and Methods Three teams of experts in neuroimaging, cardiac imaging, and bone imaging were tasked to develop a 20-30-minute PET/MR imaging protocol for detection of chemotherapy-induced tissue injuries of the brain, heart, and bone. In an institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant, prospective study from April to July 2016, 10 pediatric cancer survivors who completed chemotherapy underwent imaging of the brain, heart, and bone with a 3-T PET/MR imager. Cumulative chemotherapy doses and clinical symptoms were correlated with the severity of MR imaging abnormalities by using linear regression analyses. MR imaging measures of brain perfusion and metabolism were compared among eight patients who were treated with methotrexate and eight untreated age-matched control subjects by using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results Combined brain, heart, and bone examinations were completed within 90 minutes. Eight of 10 cancer survivors had abnormal findings on brain, heart, and bone images, including six patients with and two patients without clinical symptoms. Cumulative chemotherapy doses correlated significantly with MR imaging measures of left ventricular ejection fraction and end-systolic volume, but not with the severity of brain or bone abnormalities. Methotrexate-treated cancer survivors had significantly lower cerebral blood flow and metabolic activity in key brain areas compared with control subjects. Conclusion The feasibility of a single examination for assessment of chemotherapy-induced injuries of the brain, heart, and joints was shown. Earlier detection of tissue injuries may enable initiation of timely interventions and help to preserve long-term health of pediatric cancer survivors.

Integrated PET/MRI has shown to be valuable in the clinical setting and has many promising future applications. The protocol presented here will provide step-by-step instructions for the acquisition of whole-body 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI data in children with cancer. It also provides instructions on how to combine a whole-body staging scan with a local tumor scan for evaluation of the primary tumor. The focus of this protocol is to be both comprehensive and time-efficient, which are two ubiquitous needs for clinical applications. This protocol was originally developed for children above 6 years, or old enough to comply with breath-hold instructions, but can also be applied to patients under general anesthesia. Similarly, this protocol can be modified to fit institutional preferences in terms of choice of MRI pulse sequences for both the whole-body scan and local tumor assessment.\nView details for\n[PubMedID 29286486](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29286486)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000393199200041](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000393199200041)\nWe designed the EURAMOS-1 trial to investigate whether intensified postoperative chemotherapy for patients whose tumour showed a poor response to preoperative chemotherapy (10% viable tumour) improved event-free survival in patients with high-grade osteosarcoma.EURAMOS-1 was an open-label, international, phase 3 randomised, controlled trial. Consenting patients with newly diagnosed, resectable, high-grade osteosarcoma aged 40 years or younger were eligible for randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either postoperative cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (MAP) or MAP plus ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE) using concealed permuted blocks with three stratification factors: trial group; location of tumour (proximal femur or proximal humerus vs other limb vs axial skeleton); and presence of metastases (no vs yes or possible). The MAP regimen consisted of cisplatin 120 mg/m(2), doxorubicin 375 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 and 2 (on weeks 1 and 6) followed 3 weeks later by high-dose methotrexate 12 g/m(2) over 4 h. The MAPIE regimen consisted of MAP as a base regimen, with the addition of high-dose ifosfamide (14 g/m(2)) at 28 g/m(2) per day with equidose mesna uroprotection, followed by etoposide 100 mg/m(2) per day over 1 h on days 1-5. The primary outcome measure was event-free survival measured in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00134030.Between April 14, 2005, and June 30, 2011, 2260 patients were registered from 325 sites in 17 countries. 618 patients with poor response were randomly assigned; 310 to receive MAP and 308 to receive MAPIE. Median follow-up was 621 months (IQR 466-766); 623 months (IQR 469-771) for the MAP group and 611 months (IQR 465-753) for the MAPIE group. 307 event-free survival events were reported (153 in the MAP group vs 154 in the MAPIE group). 193 deaths were reported (101 in the MAP group vs 92 in the MAPIE group). Event-free survival did not differ between treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR] 098 [95% CI 078-123]); hazards were non-proportional (p=00003). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (268 [89%] patients in MAP vs 268 [90%] in MAPIE), thrombocytopenia (231 [78% in MAP vs 248 [83%] in MAPIE), and febrile neutropenia without documented infection (149 [50%] in MAP vs 217 [73%] in MAPIE). MAPIE was associated with more frequent grade 4 non-haematological toxicity than MAP (35 [12%] of 301 in the MAP group vs 71 [24%] of 298 in the MAPIE group). Two patients died during postoperative therapy, one from infection (although their absolute neutrophil count was normal), which was definitely related to their MAP treatment (specifically doxorubicin and cisplatin), and one from left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which was probably related to MAPIE treatment (specifically doxorubicin). One suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction was reported in the MAP group: bone marrow infarction due to methotrexate.EURAMOS-1 results do not support the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to postoperative chemotherapy in patients with poorly responding osteosarcoma because its administration was associated with increased toxicity without improving event-free survival. The results define standard of care for this population.

Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board of three institutions. Seventy-four patients (mean age standard deviation, 14.5 years 6.5) with newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma treated at three medical centers were evaluated. Primary tumor size was assessed on pre- and posttreatment magnetic resonance images according to 1D RECIST, 2D WHO, and 3D COG measurements. Tumor responses were compared with the standard of reference (tumor volume) on the basis of RECIST, COG, and WHO therapeutic response thresholds. Agreement between the percentage reduction measurements of the methods was assessed with concordance correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and Spearman rank correlation. Agreement between therapeutic responses was assessed with Kendall tau and unweighted statistics. Tumor responses were compared with patient survival by using the log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier plots, and Cox regression. Results Agreement with the reference standard was significantly better for 3D measurement than for 1D and 2D measurements on the basis of RECIST and COG therapeutic response thresholds (concordance correlation of 0.41, 0.72, and 0.84 for 1D, 2D, and 3D measurements, respectively; P < .0001). Comparison of overall survival of responders and nonresponders demonstrated P values of .4133, .0112, .0032, and .0027 for 1D, 2D, 3D, and volume measurements, respectively, indicating that higher dimensional measurements were significantly better predictors of overall survival. Conclusion The 3D tumor measurements according to COG are better predictors of therapeutic response of Ewing sarcoma than 1D RECIST or 2D WHO measurements and show a significantly higher correlation with clinical outcomes.

Since graft failure leads to macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, we evaluated in vitro and in vivo whether nanoparticle-labeled hMSCs show distinct MR signal characteristics before and after phagocytosis by macrophages. We found that apoptotic nanoparticle-labeled hMSCs were phagocytosed by macrophages while viable nanoparticle-labeled hMSCs were not. Serial MRI scans of hMSC transplants in arthritic joints of recipient rats showed that the iron signal of apoptotic, nanoparticle-labeled hMSCs engulfed by macrophages disappeared faster compared to viable hMSCs. This corresponded to poor cartilage repair outcomes of the apoptotic hMSC transplants. Therefore, rapid decline of iron MRI signal at the transplant site can indicate cell death and predict incomplete defect repair weeks later. Currently, hMSC graft failure can be only diagnosed by lack of cartilage defect repair several months after cell transplantation. The described imaging signs can diagnose hMSC transplant failure more readily, which could enable timely re-interventions and avoid unnecessary follow up studies of lost transplants.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1038/srep25897](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep25897)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000375769300001](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000375769300001)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 27174199](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27174199)\nLimited transendothelial permeability across tumor microvessels represents a significant bottleneck in the development of tumor-specific diagnostic agents and theranostic drugs. Here, we show an approach to increase transendothelial permeability of macromolecular and nanoparticle-based contrast agents via inhibition of the type I TGF- receptor, activin-like kinase 5 (Alk5), in tumors. Alk5 inhibition significantly increased tumor contrast agent delivery and enhancement on imaging studies, while healthy organs remained relatively unaffected. Imaging data correlated with significantly decreased tumor interstitial fluid pressure, while tumor vascular density remained unchanged. This immediately clinically translatable concept involving Alk5 inhibitor pretreatment prior to an imaging study could be leveraged for improved tumor delivery of macromolecular and nanoparticle-based imaging probes and, thereby, facilitate development of more sensitive imaging tests for cancer diagnosis, enhanced tumor characterization, and personalized, image-guided therapies.\nView details for\n[PubMedID 27182558](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27182558)\nOver the past decade, innovations in the field of pediatric imaging have been based largely on single-center and retrospective studies, which provided limited advances for the benefit of pediatric patients.

We compared (18)F-FDG PET/STIR with accelerated (18)F-FDG PET/FSPGR for whole-body tumour imaging in children and young adults.Thirty-three children and young adults (17.55.5years, range 10-30) with malignant lymphoma or sarcoma underwent a (18)F-FDG PET staging examination, followed by ferumoxytol-enhanced STIR and FSPGR whole-body MR. (18)F-FDG PET scans were fused with MR data and the number and location of tumours on each integrated examination were determined. Histopathology and follow-up imaging served as standard of reference. The agreement of each MR sequence with the reference and whole-body imaging times were compared using Cohen's kappa coefficient and Student's t-test, respectively.Comparing (18)F-FDG PET/FSPGR to (18)F-FDG PET/STIR, sensitivities were 99.3% for both, specificities were statistically equivalent, 99.8 versus 99.9%, and the agreement with the reference based on Cohen's kappa coefficient was also statistically equivalent, 0.989 versus 0.992. However, the total scan-time for accelerated FSPGR of 19.85.3minutes was significantly shorter compared to 29.07.6minutes for STIR (p=0.001).F-FDG PET/FSPGR demonstrated equivalent sensitivities and specificities for cancer staging compared to (18)F-FDG PET/STIR, but could be acquired with shorter acquisition time. Breath-hold FSPGR sequences shorten the data acquisition time for whole-body MR and PET/MR. Ferumoxytol provides long-lasting vascular contrast for whole-body MR and PET/MR.

(18)F-FDG PET/CT is a highly sensitive and specific imaging modality for whole-body evaluation of pediatric malignancies. However, recent concerns about ionizing radiation exposure have led to a search for alternative imaging methods, such as whole-body MR imaging and PET/MR. As we develop new approaches for tumor staging, it is important to understand current benchmarks. This review article will synthesize the current literature on (18)F-FDG PET/CT for tumor staging in children, summarizing questions that have been solved and providing an outlook on unsolved avenues.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.2967/jnumed.114.146290](https://dx.doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.114.146290)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 25572088](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25572088)\nCurrent neuroimaging provides detailed anatomic and functional evaluation of brain tumors, allowing for improved diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. Some challenges persist even with today's advanced imaging techniques, including accurate delineation of tumor margins and distinguishing treatment effects from residual or recurrent tumor. Ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are an emerging tool that can add clinically useful information due to their distinct physiochemical features and biodistribution, while having a good safety profile. Nanoparticles can be used as a platform for theranostic drugs, which have shown great promise for the treatment of CNS malignancies. This review will provide an overview of clinical ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxides and how they can be applied to the diagnostic and therapeutic neuro-oncologic setting.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.2217/NNM.14.203](https://dx.doi.org/10.2217/NNM.14.203)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000352806000009](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000352806000009)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 25867862](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25867862)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0142665](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142665)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 26569397](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26569397)\nUltra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO) are promising contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). USPIO mediated proton relaxation rate enhancement is strongly dependent on compartmentalization of the agent and can vary depending on their intracellular or extracellular location in the tumor microenvironment. We compared the T1- and T2-enhancement pattern of intracellular and extracellular USPIO in mouse models of cancer and pilot data from patients. A better understanding of these MR signal effects will enable non-invasive characterizations of the composition of the tumor microenvironment.Six 4T1 and six MMTV-PyMT mammary tumors were grown in mice and imaged with ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI. R1 relaxation rates were calculated for different tumor types and different tumor areas and compared with histology. The transendothelial leakage rate of ferumoxytol was obtained by our measured relaxivity of ferumoxytol and compared between different tumor types, using a t-test. Additionally, 3 patients with malignant sarcomas were imaged with ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI. T1- and T2-enhancement patterns were compared with histopathology in a descriptive manner as a proof of concept for clinical translation of our observations.4T1 tumors showed central areas of high signal on T1 and low signal on T2 weighted MR images, which corresponded to extracellular nanoparticles in a necrotic core on histopathology. MMTV-PyMT tumors showed little change on T1 but decreased signal on T2 weighted images, which correlated to compartmentalized nanoparticles in tumor associated macrophages. Only 4T1 tumors demonstrated significantly increased R1 relaxation rates of the tumor core compared to the tumor periphery (p<0.001). Transendothelial USPIO leakage was significantly higher for 4T1 tumors (3.40.9x10-3 mL/min/100cm3) compared to MMTV-PyMT tumors (1.00.9x10-3 mL/min/100 cm3). Likewise, ferumoxytol imaging in patients showed similar findings with high T1 signal in areas of tumor necrosis and low signal in areas of intracellularly compartmentalized iron.Differential T1- and T2-enhancement patterns of USPIO in tumors enable conclusions about their intracellular and extracellular location. This information can be used to characterize the composition of the tumor microenvironment.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0142665](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142665)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 26569397](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26569397)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00247-013-2850-7](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00247-013-2850-7)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 25142332](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25142332)\nBasic science research aims to explore, understand and predict phenomena in the natural world. It spurs the discovery of fundamentally new principles and leads to new knowledge and new concepts. By comparison, applied research employs basic science knowledge toward practical applications. In the clinical realm, basic science research and applied research should be closely connected. Basic science discoveries can build the foundation for a broad range of practical applications and thereby bring major benefits to human health, education, environment and economy.

In this report, the design and characterization of novel multifunctional \"theranostic\" nanoparticles (TNPs) is described for enzyme-specific drug activation at tumor sites and simultaneous in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of drug delivery. TNPs are synthesized by conjugation of FDA-approved iron oxide nanoparticles ferumoxytol to an MMP-activatable peptide conjugate of azademethylcolchicine (ICT), creating CLIO-ICTs (TNPs). Significant cell death is observed in TNP-treated MMP-14 positive MMTV-PyMT breast cancer cells in vitro, but not MMP-14 negative fibroblasts or cells treated with ferumoxytol alone. Intravenous administration of TNPs to MMTV-PyMT tumor-bearing mice and subsequent MRI demonstrates significant tumor selective accumulation of the TNP, an observation confirmed by histopathology. Treatment with CLIO-ICTs induces a significant antitumor effect and tumor necrosis, a response not observed with ferumoxytol. Furthermore, no toxicity or cell death is observed in normal tissues following treatment with CLIO-ICTs, ICT, or ferumoxytol. These findings demonstrate proof of concept for a new nanotemplate that integrates tumor specificity, drug delivery and in vivo imaging into a single TNP entity through attachment of enzyme-activated prodrugs onto magnetic nanoparticles. This novel approach holds the potential to significantly improve targeted cancer therapies, and ultimately enable personalized therapy regimens.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1002/smll.201301456](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.201301456)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 24038954](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24038954)\nAbout 43 million individuals in the US currently suffer from disabilities due to arthritis. Cartilage defects are the major source of pain in the affected joints. Current treatments, whilst alleviating some of the clinical symptoms, prove insufficient to cure the underlying irreversible cartilage loss. Stem cells represent a unique source for restoration of cartilage defects. Pre-clinical and clinical trials are currently pursued to investigate the potential of various types of stem cells and stem cell derived chondrocytes to repair arthritic joints. A major challenge with all stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration approaches is death of the transplanted cells with clearance by the immune system. Our current inability to diagnose successful or unsuccessful engraftment of transplanted cells non-invasively in vivo represents a major bottleneck for the development of successful stem cell therapies. A large variety of non-invasive Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging techniques have been developed over the last decade, which enable sensitive in vivo detection of Matrix Associated Stem Cell Implants (MASI) and early diagnosis of related complications. While initially focused on successfully harvesting cellular MR imaging approaches with easily applicable SuperParamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIO), our team began to observe details that will facilitate clinical translation. We therefore started a broader effort to define a comprehensive set of novel, clinically applicable imaging approaches for stem cell transplants in patients. We established immediately clinically applicable nanoparticle labeling techniques for tracking stem cell transplants with MR imaging; we have evaluated the long term MR signal effects of iron oxide nanoparticle labeled MASI in vivo; and we have defined distinct signal characteristics of labeled viable and apoptotic MASI. This review article will provide an overview over these efforts and discuss important implications for clinical translation.\nView details for\n[PubMedID 25068075](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25068075)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC4110919](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4110919)\nEwing sarcoma (ES) is a malignancy of bone and soft tissue in children and adults. Previous registry-based studies indicate that Latino patients with ES have inferior outcomes compared to non-Latino patients, though an etiology for this difference could not be identified. To explore possible differences that might underlie this disparity, we conducted a retrospective study to compare clinical characteristics, tumor features, healthcare access, and treatment outcomes between Latino and non-Latino patients with ES.Primary data for 218 ES patients treated at two academic medical centers between 1980 and 2010 were collected. Categorical data were compared using Fisher exact tests; Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for continuous variables. Survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using log-rank testing.Latino patients were diagnosed at a younger age (P = 0.014). All other clinical and histological data were similar between groups, including radiologic and histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Latino patients had lower socioeconomic status (P = 0.001), were less likely to have insurance (P = 0.001), and were more likely to present to the emergency room at onset of symptoms (P = 0.031) rather than to primary care physicians. Five-year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were similar between Latino and non-Latino patients (EFS: 60.5% vs. 50.9% P = 0.37; OS: 77.6% vs. 68.6% P = 0.54).Latino patients with ES present at a younger age, and have evidence of impaired access to healthcare. Response to initial therapy appears similar between Latino and non-Latino patients.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1002/pbc.24745](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pbc.24745)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000328694300016](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000328694300016)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 23970433](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23970433)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1002/smll.201301456](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.201301456)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 24038954](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24038954)\nCancer cells overexpress matrix-type metalloproteinases (MMPs, shown as pacmen).

Materials & methods: Ferumoxytol-labeling of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) was optimized in vitro. A total of 11 rats with osteochondral defects of both femurs were implanted with ferumoxytol- or ferumoxides-labeled or unlabeled ADSCs, and underwent MRI up to 4 weeks post matrix-associated stem-cell implant. The signal-to-noise ratio of different matrix-associated stem-cell implant was compared with t-tests and correlated with histopathology. Results: An incubation concentration of 500 g iron/ml ferumoxytol and 10 g/ml protamine sulfate led to significant cellular iron uptake, T2 signal effects and unimpaired ADSC viability. In vivo, ferumoxytol- and ferumoxides-labeled ADSCs demonstrated significantly lower signal-to-noise ratio values compared with unlabeled controls (p < 0.01). Histopathology confirmed engraftment of labeled ADSCs, with slow dilution of the iron label over time. Conclusion: Ferumoxytol can be used for in vivo tracking of stem cells with MRI.

Sprague-Dawley rats (6-8 weeks old) were injected with ferumoxytol 48 hours prior to extraction of MSCs from bone marrow. Ferumoxytol uptake by these MSCs was evaluated with fluorescence, confocal, and electron microscopy and compared with results of traditional ex vivo-labeling procedures. The in vivo-labeled cells were subsequently transplanted in osteochondral defects of 14 knees of seven athymic rats and were evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging up to 4 weeks after transplantation. T2 relaxation times of in vivo-labeled MSC transplants and unlabeled control transplants were compared by using t tests. MR data were correlated with histopathologic results.Results:In vivo-labeled MSCs demonstrated significantly higher ferumoxytol uptake compared with ex vivo-labeled cells. With electron microscopy, iron oxide nanoparticles were localized in secondary lysosomes. In vivo-labeled cells demonstrated significant T2 shortening effects in vitro and in vivo when they were compared with unlabeled control cells (T2 in vivo, 15.4 vs 24.4 msec; P < .05) and could be tracked in osteochondral defects for 4 weeks. Histologic examination confirmed the presence of iron in labeled transplants and defect remodeling.Conclusion:Intravenous ferumoxytol can be used to effectively label MSCs in vivo and can be used for tracking of stem cell transplants with MR imaging. This method eliminates risks of contamination and biologic alteration of MSCs associated with ex vivo-labeling procedures.

However, there are numerous hurdles to be overcome prior to the widespread application of these cells in the clinical setting. One of the primary barriers to effective stem cell therapy is the hostile environment that progenitor cells encounter in the clinical injury wound setting. In order to promote cellular survival, stem cell differentiation, and participation in tissue regeneration, relevant cells and delivery scaffolds must be paired with strategies to prevent cell death to ensure that these cells can survive to form de novo tissue. The Bcl-2 protein is a prosurvival member of a family of proteins that regulate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Using several strategies to overexpress the Bcl-2 protein, we demonstrated a decrease in the mediators of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. This was shown through the use of two different clinical tissue repair models. Cells overexpressing Bcl-2 not only survived within the wound environment at a statistically significantly higher rate than control cells, but also increased tissue regeneration. Finally, we used a nonintegrating minicircle technology to achieve this in a potentially clinically applicable strategy for stem cell therapy.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.5966/sctm.2013-0035](https://dx.doi.org/10.5966/sctm.2013-0035)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 23934910](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23934910)\nBACKGROUND: Solid malignant tumors are more highly cellular than benign lesions and hence have a restricted diffusion of water molecules. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) can differentiate between benign and malignant pediatric abdominal tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed DWI scans of 68 consecutive children with 39 benign and 34 malignant abdominal masses. To calculate the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and ADC values, we used 1.5-T sequences at TR/TE/b-value of 5,250-7,500/54-64/b=0, 500 and 3-T sequences at 3,500-4,000/66-73/b=0, 500, 800. ADC values were compared between benign and malignant and between data derived at 1.5 tesla (T) and at 3 tesla magnetic field strength, using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, ANOVA and a receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in ADC values obtained at 1.5T and 3T (P=0.962). Mean ADC values (10(-3)mm(2)/s) were 1.07 for solid malignant tumors, 1.6 for solid benign tumors, 2.9 for necrotic portions of malignant tumors and 3.1 for cystic benign lesions. The differences between malignant and benign solid tumors were statistically significant (P=0.000025). ROC analysis revealed an optimal cut-off ADC value for differentiating malignant and benign solid tumors as 1.29 with excellent inter-observer reliability (alpha score 0.88). CONCLUSION: DWI scans and ADC values can contribute to distinguishing between benign and malignant pediatric abdominal tumors.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00247-013-2626-0](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00247-013-2626-0)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 23666206](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23666206)\nTo compare the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and ophthalmoscopy for staging of retinoblastoma.MR and ophthalmoscopic images of 36 patients who underwent enucleation were evaluated retrospectively following institutional review board approval. Histopathology being the standard of reference, the sensitivity and specificity of both diagnostic modalities were compared regarding growth pattern, iris neoangiogenesis, retinal detachment, vitreous seeds and optic nerve invasion. Data were analysed via McNemar's test.Both investigations showed no significant difference in accuracy for the detection of different tumour growth patterns (P = 0.80). Vitreous seeding detection was superior by ophthalmoscopy (P < 0.001). For prelaminar optic nerve invasion, MR imaging showed similar sensitivity as ophthalmoscopy but increased specificity of 40 % (CI 0.12-0.74) vs. 20 % (0.03-0.56). MR detected optic nerve involvement past the lamina cribrosa with a sensitivity of 80 % (0.28-0.99) and a specificity of 74 % (0.55-0.88). The absence of optic nerve enhancement excluded histopathological infiltration, but the presence of optic nerve enhancement included a high number of false positives (22-24 %).Ophthalmoscopy remains the method of choice for determining extent within the globe while MR imaging is useful for evaluating extraocular tumour extension. Thus, both have their own strengths and contribute uniquely to the staging of retinoblastoma. Ophthalmoscopy: method of choice for determining extent of retinoblastoma within the globe. MR imaging provides optimal evaluation of extrascleral and extraocular tumour extension. Positive enhancement of the optic nerve on MRI does not necessarily indicate involvement.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00330-012-2707-8](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-012-2707-8)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000317427500015](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000317427500015)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 23160663](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23160663)\nTumor-associated macrophages (TAM) maintain a chronic inflammation in cancers, which is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

Blood half-lives of GEH121333 and ferumoxytol were measured by relaxometry (n=4 each). Tolerance was assessed in healthy rats injected with high dose GEH121333, vehicle or saline (n=4 each). Animals were monitored for 7days regarding body weight, complete blood counts and serum chemistry, followed by histological evaluation of visceral organs. MR imaging was performed on mice harboring MMTV-PyMT-derived breast adenocarcinomas using a 7T scanner before and up to 72h post-injection (p.i.) of GEH121333 (n=10) or ferumoxytol (n=9). Tumor R1 , R2 * relaxation rates were compared between different experimental groups and time points, using a linear mixed effects model with a random effect for each animal. MR data were correlated with histopathology. GEH121333 showed a longer circulation half-life than ferumoxytol. Intravenous GEH121333 did not produce significant adverse effects in rats. All tumors demonstrated significant enhancement on T1 , T2 and T2 *-weighted images at 1, 24, 48 and 72h p.i. GEH121333 generated stronger tumor T2 * enhancement than ferumoxytol. Histological analysis verified intracellular compartmentalization of GEH121333 by TAM at 24, 48 and 72h p.i. MR imaging with GEH121333 nanoparticles represents a novel biomarker for TAM assessment. This new USPIO MR contrast agent provides a longer blood half-life and better TAM enhancement compared with the iron supplement ferumoxytol.

Ferucarbotran-labeled hMSCs, non-labeled hMSCs and scaffold only served as controls. Chondrogenic differentiation was induced and gene expression and histologic evaluation were performed. The proportions of spindle-shaped vs. round cells of chondrogenic pellets were compared between experimental groups using the Fisher's exact test. Labeled and unlabeled hMSCs and chondrocytes in scaffolds were implanted into cartilage defects of porcine femoral condyles and underwent MR imaging with T1- and T2-weighted SE and GE sequences. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) between implants and adjacent cartilage were determined and analyzed for significant differences between different experimental groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Significance was assigned for p<0.017, considering a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.Collagen type II gene expression levels were not significantly different between different groups (p>0.017). However, hMSC differentiation into chondrocytes was superior for unlabeled and GadofluorineM-Cy-labeled cells compared with Ferucarbotran-labeled cells, as evidenced by a significantly higher proportion of spindle cells in chondrogenic pellets (p<0.05). GadofluorineM-Cy-labeled hMSCs and chondrocytes showed a positive signal effect on T1-weighted images and a negative signal effect on T2-weighted images while Ferucarbotran-labeled cells provided a negative signal effect on all sequences. CNR data for both GadofluorineM-Cy-labeled and Ferucarbotran-labeled hMSCs were significantly different compared to unlabeled control cells on T1-weighted SE and T2*-weighted MR images (p<0.017).hMSCs can be labeled by simple incubation with GadofluorineM-Cy. The labeled cells provide significant MR signal effects and less impaired chondrogenesis compared to Ferucarbotran-labeled hMSCs.

SNRs decreased significantly over time for the apoptotic implants (SNRs on the day of matrix-associated stem cell implantation, 2 weeks after the procedure, and 4 weeks after the procedure were 16.9, 10.9, and 6.7, respectively; P = .0004) but not for the viable implants (SNRs on the day of matrix-associated stem cell implantation, 2 weeks after the procedure, and 4 weeks after the procedure were 17.7, 16.2, and 15.7, respectively; P = .2218). At 4 weeks after matrix-associated stem cell implantation, SNRs of apoptotic ADSCs were significantly lower than those of viable ADSCs (mean, 6.7 vs 15.7; P = .0013). This corresponded to differential migration of iron-loaded macrophages into MASIs.Iron oxide loading of macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system by means of intravenous ferumoxytol injection can be utilized to monitor differential migration of bone marrow macrophages into viable and apoptotic MASIs in a rat model.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1148/radiol.12112393](https://dx.doi.org/10.1148/radiol.12112393)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 22820731](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22820731)\nRetinoblastoma is the most common intraocular childhood malignancy, with a prevalence of one in 18,000 children younger than 5 years old in the United States. In 80% of patients, retinoblastoma is diagnosed before the age of three, and in 95% of patients, retinoblastoma is diagnosed before the age of five. Although reports exist of retinoblastoma in adults, onset beyond 6 years of age is rare. Broadly, retinoblastoma may be classified into two groups: sporadic and heritable. In either case, the origin of the tumor is a biallelic mutation in primitive neuroepithelial cells. Although their details vary, several staging schemes are used to describe the extent of retinoblastoma according to the following four general criteria: intraocular location, extraocular (extraorbital) location, central nervous system disease, and systemic metastases. In the past decade, substantial changes have taken place in terms of staging and monitoring treatment in patients with retinoblastoma. Diagnosis and treatment of retinoblastoma involve a multidisciplinary approach, for which imaging is a vital component. Increasing awareness and concerns about the effects of radiation in patients with retinoblastoma have led to a shift away from external-beam radiation therapy and toward chemotherapy and locoregional treatment, as well as the establishment of magnetic resonance imaging as the most important imaging modality for diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1148/rg.325115176](https://dx.doi.org/10.1148/rg.325115176)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000308632900010](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000308632900010)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 22977020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22977020)\nTumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in breast cancers foster several aspects of tumor progression and metastasis, and represent a biomarker associated with an unfavorable clinical outcome.

Nonradioactive carrier MIBG molecules inhibit uptake of (131)I-MIBG, theoretically resulting in less tumor radiation and increased risk of cardiovascular toxicity. Our aim was to establish the maximum tolerated dose of no-carrier-added (NCA) (131)I-MIBG, with secondary aims of assessing tumor and organ dosimetry and overall response.Eligible patients were 1-30 y old with resistant neuroblastoma, (131)I-MIBG uptake, and cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cells. A diagnostic dose of NCA (131)I-MIBG was followed by 3 dosimetry scans to assess radiation dose to critical organs and soft-tissue tumors. The treatment dose of NCA (131)I-MIBG (specific activity, 165 MBq/g) was adjusted as necessary on the basis of critical organ tolerance limits. Autologous hematopoietic stem cells were infused 14 d after therapy to abrogate prolonged myelosuppression. Response and toxicity were evaluated on day 60. The NCA (131)I-MIBG was escalated from 444 to 777 MBq/kg (12-21 mCi/kg) using a 3 + 3 design. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was failure to reconstitute neutrophils to greater than 500/L within 28 d or platelets to greater than 20,000/L within 56 d, or grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) except for predefined exclusions.Three patients each were evaluable at 444, 555, and 666 MBq/kg without DLT. The dose of 777 MBq/kg dose was not feasible because of organ dosimetry limits; however, 3 assigned patients were evaluable for a received dose of 666 MBq/kg, providing a total of 6 patients evaluable for toxicity at 666 MBq/kg without DLT. Mean whole-body radiation was 0.23 mGy/MBq, and mean organ doses were 0.92, 0.82, and 1.2 mGy/MBq of MIBG for the liver, lung, and kidney, respectively.

Excessive cellular iron load from SPIO labeling, however, impairs stem cell differentiation. The purpose of this study was to magnetically label human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) via a reduced exposure protocol that maintains a significant MR signal and no significant impairment to cellular pluripotency or differentiation potential. hESCs were labeled by simple incubation with Food and Drug Administration-approved ferumoxides, using concentrations of 50- 200 g Fe/ml and incubation times of 3-24 h. The most reduced exposure labeling protocol that still provided a significant MR signal comparable to accepted labeling protocols was selected for subsequent studies. Labeled hESCs were compared to unlabeled controls for differences in pluripotency as studied by fluorescence staining for SSEA-1, SSEA-4, TRA-60, and TRA-81 and in differentiation capacity as studied by quantitative real-time PCR for hOCT4, hACTC1, hSOX1, and hAFP after differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs). Subsequent MR and microscopy imaging were performed to evaluate for cellular iron distribution and long-term persistence of the label. An incubation concentration of 50 g Fe/ml and incubation time of 3 h demonstrated a significantly reduced exposure protocol that yielded an intracellular iron uptake of 4.50 0.27 pg, an iron content comparable to currently accepted SPIO labeling protocols. Labeled and unlabeled hESCs showed no difference in pluripotency or differentiation capacity. Ferumoxide-labeled hESCs demonstrated persistent MR contrast effects as embryoid bodies for 21 days. Electron microscopy confirmed persistent lysosomal storage of iron oxide particles in EBs up to 9 days, while additional microscopy visualization confirmed the iron distribution within single and multiple EBs. Labeling hESCs with ferumoxides by this tailored protocol reduces exposure of cells to the labeling agent while allowing for long-term visualization with MR imaging and the retention of cellular pluripotency and differentiation potential.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.3727/096368912X653156](https://dx.doi.org/10.3727/096368912X653156)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000315001400002](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000315001400002)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 22862886](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22862886)\nThe purpose of our study was to assess the chondrogenic potential and the MR signal effects of GadofluorineM-Cy labeled matrix associated stem cell implants (MASI) in pig knee specimen.Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were labeled with the micelle-based contrast agent GadofluorineM-Cy. Ferucarbotran-labeled hMSCs, non-labeled hMSCs and scaffold only served as controls. Chondrogenic differentiation was induced and gene expression and histologic evaluation were performed. The proportions of spindle-shaped vs. round cells of chondrogenic pellets were compared between experimental groups using the Fisher's exact test. Labeled and unlabeled hMSCs and chondrocytes in scaffolds were implanted into cartilage defects of porcine femoral condyles and underwent MR imaging with T1- and T2-weighted SE and GE sequences. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) between implants and adjacent cartilage were determined and analyzed for significant differences between different experimental groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Significance was assigned for p<0.017, considering a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.Collagen type II gene expression levels were not significantly different between different groups (p>0.017). However, hMSC differentiation into chondrocytes was superior for unlabeled and GadofluorineM-Cy-labeled cells compared with Ferucarbotran-labeled cells, as evidenced by a significantly higher proportion of spindle cells in chondrogenic pellets (p<0.05). GadofluorineM-Cy-labeled hMSCs and chondrocytes showed a positive signal effect on T1-weighted images and a negative signal effect on T2-weighted images while Ferucarbotran-labeled cells provided a negative signal effect on all sequences.

However, much remains to be understood regarding the in vivo kinetics of transplanted cells. A non-invasive method to repetitively monitor transplanted stem cells in vivo would allow investigators to directly monitor stem cell transplants and identify successful or unsuccessful engraftment outcomes. A wide range of stem cells continues to be investigated for countless applications. This protocol focuses on 3 different stem cell populations: human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. HEK 293 cells are derived from human embryonic kidney cells grown in culture with sheared adenovirus 5 DNA. These cells are widely used in research because they are easily cultured, grow quickly and are easily transfected. hMSCs are found in adult marrow. These cells can be replicated as undifferentiated cells while maintaining multipotency or the potential to differentiate into a limited number of cell fates. hMSCs can differentiate to lineages of mesenchymal tissues, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, tendon, muscle, and marrow stroma. iPS cells are genetically reprogrammed adult cells that have been modified to express genes and factors similar to defining properties of embryonic stem cells. These cells are pluripotent meaning they have the capacity to differentiate into all cell lineages. Both hMSCs and iPS cells have demonstrated tissue regenerative capacity in-vivo. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging together with the use of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticle cell labels have proven effective for in vivo tracking of stem cells due to the near microscopic anatomical resolution, a longer blood half-life that permits longitudinal imaging and the high sensitivity for cell detection provided by MR imaging of SPIO nanoparticles. In addition, MR imaging with the use of SPIOs is clinically translatable. SPIOs are composed of an iron oxide core with a dextran, carboxydextran or starch surface coat that serves to contain the bioreactive iron core from plasma components. These agents create local magnetic field inhomogeneities that lead to a decreased signal on T2-weighted MR images. Unfortunately, SPIOs are no longer being manufactured. Second generation, ultrasmall SPIOs (USPIO), however, offer a viable alternative. Ferumoxytol (FerahemeTM) is one USPIO composed of a non-stoichiometric magnetite core surrounded by a polyglucose sorbitol carboxymethylether coat. The colloidal, particle size of ferumoxytol is 17-30 nm as determined by light scattering. The molecular weight is 750 kDa, and the relaxivity constant at 2T MRI field is 58.609 mM(-1) sec(-1) strength. Ferumoxytol was recently FDA-approved as an iron supplement for treatment of iron deficiency in patients with renal failure. Our group has applied this agent in an \"off label\" use for cell labeling applications. Our technique demonstrates efficient labeling of stem cells with ferumoxytol that leads to significant MR signal effects of labeled cells on MR images. This technique may be applied for non-invasive monitoring of stem cell therapies in pre-clinical and clinical settings.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.3791/3482](https://dx.doi.org/10.3791/3482)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000209222200040](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000209222200040)\nHuman embryonic stem cells (hESC) can generate cardiomyocytes (CM), which offer promising treatments for cardiomyopathies in children.

Morphology, differentiation and viability were consistent between experimental groups.hESC-CM should be labeled prior to CM differentiation to achieve a significant MR signal.

MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice harboring mammary carcinomas underwent nanoparticle-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) up to 1 hour and 24 hours after injection. The tumor enhancement on MRIs was correlated with the presence and location of TAMs and nanoparticles by confocal microscopy.In vitro studies revealed that iron oxide nanoparticles are preferentially phagocytosed by TAMs but not by malignant tumor cells. In vivo, all tumors showed an initial contrast agent perfusion on immediate postcontrast MRIs with gradual transendothelial leakage into the tumor interstitium. Twenty-four hours after injection, all tumors showed a persistent signal decline on MRIs. TAM depletion via CSF1 monoclonal antibodies led to significant inhibition of tumor nanoparticle enhancement. Detection of iron using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine-enhanced Prussian Blue staining, combined with immunodetection of CD68, localized iron oxide nanoparticles to TAMs, showing that the signal effects on delayed MRIs were largely due to TAM-mediated uptake of contrast agent.These data indicate that tumor enhancement with clinically applicable iron oxide nanoparticles may serve as a new biomarker for long-term prognosis, related treatment decisions, and the evaluation of new immune-targeted therapies.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3420](https://dx.doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3420)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000294477600020](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000294477600020)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 21791632](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21791632)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC3166957](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166957)\nGenetically modified natural killer (NK) cells that recognize tumor-associated surface antigens have recently shown promise as a novel approach for cancer immunotherapy.

Compared to nonlabeled controls, progenies of labeled MSCs exhibited similar chondrocyte morphology after chondrogenic differentiation, but the labeled cells demonstrated significantly reduced GAG production (p < 0.05).DiD and DiD/ferucarbotran labeling of hMSC does not interfere with cell viability or morphologic differentiation into chondrocytes, but labeled cells exhibit significantly less GAG production compared to unlabeled cells.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s11307-010-0322-0](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11307-010-0322-0)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000286395600002](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000286395600002)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 20379785](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20379785)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC3023037](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3023037)\nStem cell based therapies offer significant potential for the field of regenerative medicine. However, much remains to be understood regarding the in vivo kinetics of transplanted cells. A non-invasive method to repetitively monitor transplanted stem cells in vivo would allow investigators to directly monitor stem cell transplants and identify successful or unsuccessful engraftment outcomes. A wide range of stem cells continues to be investigated for countless applications. This protocol focuses on 3 different stem cell populations: human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. HEK 293 cells are derived from human embryonic kidney cells grown in culture with sheared adenovirus 5 DNA. These cells are widely used in research because they are easily cultured, grow quickly and are easily transfected. hMSCs are found in adult marrow. These cells can be replicated as undifferentiated cells while maintaining multipotency or the potential to differentiate into a limited number of cell fates. hMSCs can differentiate to lineages of mesenchymal tissues, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, tendon, muscle, and marrow stroma. iPS cells are genetically reprogrammed adult cells that have been modified to express genes and factors similar to defining properties of embryonic stem cells. These cells are pluripotent meaning they have the capacity to differentiate into all cell lineages. Both hMSCs and iPS cells have demonstrated tissue regenerative capacity in-vivo. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging together with the use of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticle cell labels have proven effective for in vivo tracking of stem cells due to the near microscopic anatomical resolution, a longer blood half-life that permits longitudinal imaging and the high sensitivity for cell detection provided by MR imaging of SPIO nanoparticles. In addition, MR imaging with the use of SPIOs is clinically translatable. SPIOs are composed of an iron oxide core with a dextran, carboxydextran or starch surface coat that serves to contain the bioreactive iron core from plasma components. These agents create local magnetic field inhomogeneities that lead to a decreased signal on T2-weighted MR images. Unfortunately, SPIOs are no longer being manufactured. Second generation, ultrasmall SPIOs (USPIO), however, offer a viable alternative. Ferumoxytol (FerahemeTM) is one USPIO composed of a non-stoichiometric magnetite core surrounded by a polyglucose sorbitol carboxymethylether coat. The colloidal, particle size of ferumoxytol is 17-30 nm as determined by light scattering. The molecular weight is 750 kDa, and the relaxivity constant at 2T MRI field is 58.609 mM(-1) sec(-1) strength. Ferumoxytol was recently FDA-approved as an iron supplement for treatment of iron deficiency in patients with renal failure. Our group has applied this agent in an \"off label\" use for cell labeling applications. Our technique demonstrates efficient labeling of stem cells with ferumoxytol that leads to significant MR signal effects of labeled cells on MR images. This technique may be applied for non-invasive monitoring of stem cell therapies in pre-clinical and clinical settings.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.3791/3482](https://dx.doi.org/10.3791/3482)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 22083287](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22083287)\nLiposarcoma is a soft-tissue sarcoma typically seen in adults.

One group (A) remained untreated whereas a second group (B) underwent mitomycin C-induced apoptosis induction. Viability of group A and apoptosis of group B was confirmed by caspase-assays and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) stains. Labeled viable hMSCs, unlabeled viable hMSCs, labeled apoptotic hMSCs, and unlabeled apoptotic hMSCs (n = 7 samples each) in an agarose scaffold were implanted into cartilage defects of porcine patellae specimens and underwent MR imaging at 7 T, using T1-weighted spin-echo sequences, T2-weighted spin-echo sequences, and T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequences. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of the implants were calculated and compared between different experimental groups using linear mixed regression models.Ferumoxides-labeled hMSCs provided a strong negative T2 and T2*-enhancement. Corresponding SNR data of labeled hMSCs were significantly lower compared with unlabeled controls (P < 0.05). Apoptosis induction resulted in a significant signal decline of ferumoxides-labeled hMSC transplants on short echo time T2-weighted spinecho sequences. SNR data of labeled apoptotic hMSCs were significantly lower compared with labeled viable hMSCs (P < 0.05).Apoptosis of transplanted ferumoxides-labeled stem cells in cartilage defects can be visualized noninvasively by a significant signal decline on T2-weighted MR images. The described MR signal characteristics may serve as a noninvasive outcome measure for the assessment of matrix-associated stem cell implants in clinical practice. Additional studies are needed to further enhance the observed differences between viable and apoptotic cells, for example, by further optimizing the applied MR pulse sequence parameters or intracellular contrast agent concentration.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1097/RLI.0b013e3181ed566c](https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/RLI.0b013e3181ed566c)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000282005200008](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000282005200008)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 20808236](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20808236)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC2943569](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2943569)\nThe purpose of this study was to compare viable and nonviable bilabeled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in arthritic joints with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical imaging (OI).

Three rats served as untreated controls. Optical imaging of the knee and ankle joints was done with an integrated optical imaging/radiography system before and up to 24 hours following intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg indocyanine green. The fluorescence signal intensities of arthritic and normal joints were compared for significant differences, using generalized estimating equation models. Specimens of knee and ankle joints were further processed and evaluated by histology.Immediately after administration, indocyanine green provided a significant increase in the fluorescence signal of arthritic joints compared with baseline values (P < 0.05). The fluorescence signal of arthritic joints was significantly higher compared with that of nonarthritic control joints at 1-720 minutes after intravenous injection (P < 0.05). Fusion of indocyanine green-enhanced optical imaging and radiography allowed for anatomic coregistration of the inflamed tissue with the associated joint. Hematoxylin and eosin staining confirmed marked synovial inflammation of arthritic joints and the absence of inflammation in control joints.Indocyanine green-enhanced optical imaging is a clinically applicable tool for detection of arthritic tissue. Using relatively high doses of indocyanine green, long-term enhanced fluorescence of arthritic joints can be achieved. This may facilitate simultaneous evaluations of multiple joints in a clinical setting.

Tumor signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) were compared between different experimental groups by using the Kruskal-Wallis test and were correlated with histopathologic findings. Differences with P < .05 were considered significant.FR-positive breast cancer cells showed a significant P1133 uptake which was inhibited by FFA. MDA-MB-231 cells showed the highest level of P1133 uptake and the strongest T2 effect on MR images. In vivo, all tumors showed an initial perfusion effect.

Matrix associated stem cell implants (MASI) aim to regenerate cartilage defects due to arthritic or traumatic joint injuries. Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the ability to differentiate into cells of the chondrogenic lineage and have shown promising results for cell-based articular cartilage repair technologies. Autologous MSCs can be isolated from a variety of tissues, can be expanded in cell cultures without losing their differentiation potential, and have demonstrated chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo(1, 2). In order to provide local retention and viability of transplanted MSCs in cartilage defects, a scaffold is needed, which also supports subsequent differentiation and proliferation. The architecture of the scaffold guides tissue formation and permits the extracellular matrix, produced by the stem cells, to expand. Previous investigations have shown that a 2% agarose scaffold may support the development of stable hyaline cartilage and does not induce immune responses(3). Long term retention of transplanted stem cells in MASI is critical for cartilage regeneration. Labeling of MSCs with iron oxide nanoparticles allows for long-term in vivo tracking with non-invasive MR imaging techniques(4). This presentation will demonstrate techniques for labeling MSCs with iron oxide nanoparticles, the generation of cell-agarose constructs and implantation of these constructs into cartilage defects.

A diagnostic technique that could visualize transplanted hESC-CMs could help to optimize stem cell delivery techniques. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop a labeling technique for hESCs and hESC-CMs with the FDA-approved contrast agent indocyanine green (ICG) for optical imaging (OI). hESCs were labeled with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 mg/ml of ICG for 30, 45, and 60 min at 37 degrees C. Longitudinal OI studies were performed with both hESCs and hESC-CMs. The expression of surface proteins was assessed with immunofluorescent staining. hESCs labeled with 2 mg ICG/ml for 60 min achieved maximum fluorescence. Longitudinal studies revealed that the fluorescent signal was equivalent to controls at 120 h postlabeling. The fluorescence signal of hESCs and hESC-CMs at 1, 24, and 48 h was significantly higher compared to precontrast data (p < 0.05). Immunocytochemistry revealed retention of cell-specific surface and nuclear markers postlabeling. These data demonstrate that hESCs and hESC-CMs labeled with ICG show a significant fluorescence up to 48 h and can be visualized with OI. The labeling procedure does not impair the viability or functional integrity of the cells.

Statistical analyses for the primary aims were performed using the chi-squared test, t-test, Mann-Whitney test, nonparametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs test and analysis of variance for repeated measures. Clinical files and imaging studies were evaluated for signs of late vascular complications of neuroblastoma patients who had received RT.The mean diameter before and after RT and the growth of the aorta were significantly lower than expected in patients with neuroblastoma (P<0.05 for each) and when compared to the growth in a control group with normal and nonirradiated aortas. Among the patients who had received RT, there was no difference due to the type of RT. Seven patients from the IORT+/-EBRT group developed vascular complications, which included hypertension (five), middle aortic syndrome (two), death due to mesenteric ischemia (one) and critical aortic stenosis, which required aortic bypass surgery (two).Patients with neuroblastoma who had received RT showed impaired growth of the abdominal aorta. Significant long-term vascular complications occurred in seven patients who received IORT+/-EBRT. Thus, CT evaluation of patients with neuroblastoma who receive RT should include not only reports of changes in tumor extension, but also documentation of perfusion, and the size and growth of the aorta and its branches over time.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00247-009-1351-1](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00247-009-1351-1)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000271028600008](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000271028600008)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 19763559](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19763559)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC2765626](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2765626)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1016/j.rcl.2009.08.003](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rcl.2009.08.003)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000272163500006](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000272163500006)\nThe role of MR imaging in pediatric arthritis is to detect early manifestations of arthritis, evaluate the extent of disease, and monitor disease activity during treatment. More specifically, MR imaging can characterize the pediatric arthropathy based on typical imaging findings, detect early signs of synovitis and erosions, stage the severity of joint involvement, demonstrate associated internal derangement, monitor disease progression or treatment response, and evaluate for complications. This article discusses MR imaging findings of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesis-related arthritis, juvenile psoriatic arthritis, and articular findings in collagen vascular diseases, septic arthritic, hemophilia, neuroarthropathy, and pseudoarthridities.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1016/j.mric.2009.03.002](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mric.2009.03.002)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000268294100006](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000268294100006)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 19524196](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19524196)\nHuman mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were labeled with Ferucarbotran by simple incubation and cultured for up to 14 d. Iron content was determined by spectrometry and the intracellular localization of the contrast agent uptake was studied by electron and confocal microscopy. At various time points after labeling, ranging from 1 to 14 d, samples with viable or lysed labeled hMSCs, as well as nonlabeled controls, underwent MRI. Spin-echo (SE) and gradient-echo (GE) sequences with multiple TRs and TEs were used at 1.5T and 3T on a clinical scanner. Spectrometry showed an initial iron oxide uptake of 7.08 pg per cell. Microscopy studies revealed lysosomal compartmentalization. Contrast agent effects of hMSCs were persistent for up to 14 d after labeling. A marked difference in the T(2) effect of compartmentalized iron oxides compared to free iron oxides was found on T(2)-weighted sequences, but not on T(2)*-weighted sequences. The observed differences may be explained by the loss of compartmentalization of iron oxide particles, the uniformity of distribution, and the subsequent increase in dephasing of protons on SE images. These results show that viable cells with compartmentalized iron oxides may-in principle-be distinguished from lysed cells or released iron oxides.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1002/mrm.22011](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mrm.22011)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000268432400007](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000268432400007)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 19353670](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19353670)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC2931823](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2931823)\nFor in vivo applications of magnetically labeled stem cells, biological effects of the labeling procedure have to be precluded. This study evaluates the effect of different ferucarbotran cell labeling protocols on chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) as well as their implications for MR imaging. hMSC were labeled with ferucarbotran using various protocols: cells were labeled with 100 microg Fe/ml for 4 and 18 h and additional samples were cultured for 6 or 12 days after the 18 h labeling. Supplementary samples were labeled by transfection with protamine sulfate. Iron uptake was quantified by ICP-spectrometry and labeled cells were investigated by transmission electron microscopy and by immunostaining for ferucarbotran. The differentiation potential of labeled cells was compared with unlabeled controls by staining with Alcian blue and Hematoxylin and Eosin, then quantified by measurements of glucosaminoglycans (GAG). Contrast agent effect at 3 T was investigated on days 1 and 14 of chondrogenic differentiation by measuring signal-to-noise ratios on T(2)-SE and T(2)*-GE sequences. Iron uptake was significant for all labeling protocols (p < 0.05). The uptake was highest after transfection with protamine sulfate (25.65 +/- 3.96 pg/cell) and lowest at an incubation time of 4 h without transfection (3.21 +/- 0.21 pg/cell). While chondrogenic differentiation was decreased using all labeling protocols, the decrease in GAG synthesis was not significant after labeling for 4 h without transfection. After labeling by simple incubation, chondrogenesis was found to be dose-dependent. MR imaging showed markedly lower SNR values of all labeled cells compared with the unlabeled controls. This contrast agent effect persisted for 14 days and the duration of differentiation. Magnetic labeling of hMSC with ferucarbotran inhibits chondrogenesis in a dose-dependent manner when using simple incubation techniques. When decreasing the incubation time to 4 h, inhibition of chondrogenesis was not significant.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1002/cmmi.276](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cmmi.276)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000269597900002](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000269597900002)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 19670250](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19670250)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC2933782](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2933782)\nMagnetic resonance (MR) imaging of bone marrow provides a noninvasive diagnosis of the vascularity, cell quantity, and composition of the normal and pathological bone marrow. This article reviews new and evolving techniques for bone marrow MR imaging with a special focus on translational and clinical applications. Evaluations of bone marrow perfusion with standard small molecular contrast agents and, more recently, with macromolecular contrast agents are currently being applied for therapy monitoring. Cell-specific contrast agents are expected to improve the sensitivity and specificity of bone marrow MR imaging. Novel cellular and molecular imaging techniques for the depiction of cell metabolism and specific biochemical pathways are discussed. Cell tracking techniques may allow specific diagnoses of inflammatory processes as well as monitoring of novel therapies based on stem cells. Future developments of fusion imaging techniques and bifunctional contrast agents are directed to combine comprehensive information about bone marrow structure and function with targeted and image-guided therapies.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1055/s-0029-1220885](https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0029-1220885)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000266502800008](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000266502800008)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 19455477](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19455477)\nIrinotecan and temozolomide have single-agent activity and schedule-dependent synergy against neuroblastoma. Because protracted administration of intravenous irinotecan is costly and inconvenient, we sought to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of oral irinotecan combined with temozolomide in children with recurrent/resistant high-risk neuroblastoma.Patients received oral temozolomide on days 1 through 5 combined with oral irinotecan on days 1 through 5 and 8 through 12 in 3-week courses. Daily oral cefixime was used to reduce irinotecan-associated diarrhea.Fourteen assessable patients received 75 courses. Because neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were initially dose-limiting, temozolomide was reduced from 100 to 75 mg/m(2)/d for subsequent patients. Irinotecan was then escalated from 30 to 60 mg/m2/d. First-course grade 3 diarrhea was dose-limiting in one of six patients treated at the irinotecan MTD of 60 mg/m2/d. Other toxicities were mild and reversible. The median SN-38 lactone area under the plasma concentration versus time curve at this dose was 72 ng . hr/mL. One patient with bulky soft tissue disease had a complete response through six courses. Six additional patients received a median of seven courses (range, three to 22 courses) before progression.This all-oral regimen was feasible and well tolerated in heavily pretreated children with resistant neuroblastoma, and seven (50%) of 14 assessable patients had response or disease stabilization for three or more courses in this phase I trial. SN-38 lactone exposures were similar to those reported with protracted intravenous irinotecan. The dosages recommended for further study in this patient population are temozolomide 75 mg/m2/d plus irinotecan 60 mg/m2/d when given with cefixime.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1200/JCO.2008.18.5918](https://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2008.18.5918)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000266193700028](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000266193700028)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 19171709](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19171709)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC2667827](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2667827)\nHepatic masses constitute about 5-6% of all intra-abdominal masses in children.

The presence, location, and size of primary tumors was determined separately for PET/CT, PET, and CT by two experienced reviewers. The diagnosis of the primary tumor was confirmed by histopathology. The presence or absence of metastases was confirmed by histopathology (n = 62) or clinical and imaging follow-up (n = 238).The sensitivities for the detection of solid primary tumors using integrated (18)F-FDG PET/CT (95%), (18)F-FDG PET alone (73%), and CT alone (93%) were not significantly different (p > 0.05). Seventeen patients showed a total of 153 distant metastases. Integrated PET/CT had a significantly higher sensitivity for the detection of these metastases (91%) than PET alone (37%; p < 0.05), but not CT alone (83%; p > 0.05). When lesions with a diameter of less than 0.5 cm were excluded, PET/CT (89%) showed a significantly higher specificity compared to PET (45%; p < 0.05) and CT (55%; p < 0.05). In a sub-analysis of pulmonary metastases, the values for sensitivity and specificity were 90%, 14%, 82% and 63%, 78%, 65%, respectively, for integrated PET/CT, stand-alone PET, and stand-alone CT.

This granulation tissue may lead to persistent or new clinical symptoms or complicate a follow up surgery. A sensitive non-invasive imaging technique, that could diagnose this granulation tissue at the bedside, would help to develop appropriate treatments. Thus, the purpose of this study was to establish a fast and economic imaging tool for the diagnosis of granulation tissue after lumbar spine surgery, using a new integrated Optical Imaging (OI)/X-ray imaging system and the FDA-approved fluorescent contrast agent Indocyanine Green (ICG).12 male Sprague Dawley rats underwent intervertebral disk surgery. Imaging of the operated lumbar spine was done with the integrated OI/X-ray system at 7 and 14 days after surgery. 6 rats served as non-operated controls. OI/X-ray scans of all rats were acquired before and after intravenous injection of the FDA-approved fluorescent dye Indocyanine Green (ICG) at a dose of 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg. The fluorescence signal of the paravertebral soft tissues was compared between different groups of rats using Wilcoxon-tests. Lumbar spines and paravertebral soft tissues were further processed with histopathology.In both dose groups, ICG provided a significant enhancement of soft tissue in the area of surgery, which corresponded with granulation tissue on histopathology. The peak and time interval of fluorescence enhancement was significantly higher using 10 mg/kg dose of ICG compared to the 1 mg/kg ICG dose. The levels of significance were p < 0.05. Fusion of OI data with X-rays allowed an accurate anatomical localization of the enhancing granulation tissue.ICG-enhanced OI is a suitable technique to diagnose granulation tissue after lumbar spine surgery. This new imaging technique may be clinically applicable for postoperative treatment monitoring. It could be also used to evaluate the effect of anti-inflammatory drugs and may even allow evaluations at the bedside with new hand-held OI scanners.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1186/1479-5876-6-73](https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-6-73)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000262373600002](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000262373600002)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 19038047](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19038047)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC2613387](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2613387)\nPediatric cancers often have specific molecular fingerprints making them primary candidates for the development of targeted imaging techniques.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether cooling procedures increase the signal yield of ICG with OI. Test samples of 0.05 and 0.02 mM ICG in 40% DMSO and 60% DMEM underwent OI at four different temperatures (5, 37, 55 and 75 degrees C). In addition, six athymic rats with an antigen-induced arthritis of the knee and ankle joints underwent OI before and after injection of ICG (10 mg/ml, dose 15 mg/kg) on two separate days with and without cooling of the joints. The fluorescent signals of the test samples and arthritic joints were measured and evaluated for significant differences before and after cooling with a t-test. In vitro studies showed a strong negative correlation between ICG temperature and fluorescent signal. The mean fluorescent signal of arthritic joints (measured in efficiency) was 0.345 before ICG-injection, 4.55 after ICG-injection and before cooling and 9.71 after ICG-injection and after cooling. The fluorescent signal enhancement of arthritic joints with ICG-enhanced OI images increased significantly after cooling (p = 0.02). The signal yield of ICG can be significantly increased by cooling the target pathology. The primary underlying cause of the temperature dependence of ICG is enhanced collisional quenching with increasing temperature. This simple cooling method may be immediately helpful to increase the fluorescence signal yield in current ICG-enhanced OI-studies in patients.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1002/cmmi.251](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cmmi.251)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000261387900006](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000261387900006)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 18973215](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18973215)\nThe objective of this study was to label the human natural killer (NK) cell line NK-92 with [(18)F]fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) for subsequent in vivo tracking to HER2/neu-positive tumors.NK-92 cells were genetically modified to NK-92-scFv(FRP5)-zeta cells, which express a chimeric antigen receptor that is specific to the tumor-associated ErbB2 (HER2/neu) antigen.

MR imaging of implanted ovarian tumors in rats was performed following injection of FR-targeted (P866 and P1048) and nontargeted (P1001 and P904) agents. Changes in longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates (DeltaR1 and DeltaR2), which were proportional to the contrast agent concentration in the tumors, were compared between tumors injected with FR-targeted and nontargeted agents.IGROV-1 cells showed uptake of P866 and P1048, which decreased with competing free folate. The DeltaR1 values were higher at 1 h following injection of P866 than following injection of P1001 (P < 0.05), indicating a higher amount of contrast agent retained in the tumor following P866 injection. There was a trend for higher DeltaR2 values at 48 h following injection of P1048 than following injection of P904, but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.09).Specific accumulation of the FR-targeted gadolinium agent P866 was suggested in an FR-positive ovarian tumor model, demonstrating the possibility of combining the specificity of receptor targeting with the improved anatomic resolution of MR imaging. This could improve diagnosis and treatment of FR-positive tumors.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00247-008-0764-6](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00247-008-0764-6)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000254751800005](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000254751800005)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 18357444](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18357444)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC2745549](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2745549)\nThis study was performed to assess the imaging characteristics and pharmacokinetics of 1,3-Bis-[7-(3-amino-2,4,6-triiodophenyl)-heptanoyl]-2-oleoyl glycerol (DHOG, Fenestra LC), a hepatobiliary contrast agent for microCT.We investigated the abdomen of 18 female C3H mice in a MicroCAT II microCT scanner before contrast agent injection and at multiple time points up to 48 hours after intravenous injection of DHOG (1 g I/kg body weight). The contrast agent effect was determined quantitatively and dynamically by measuring pre- and postcontrast Hounsfield units (HU) of the liver, aorta, spleen, and kidneys. Based on additional phantom measurements, the reproducibility of lesion detection was estimated for different lesion sizes.DHOG caused a marked early postcontrast enhancement of blood in the aorta and a very high enhancement of the spleen, both slowly declined after 90 minutes. The liver parenchyma showed a slow contrast agent accumulation and clearly increased HU data between 3 and 7 hours after injection. No significant renal parenchymal enhancement or excretion was noticed. At early time points after administration, DHOG exhibits characteristics of a macromolecular contrast agent by demonstrating a blood pool effect. At later time points, DHOG provides a prolonged, marked liver enhancement on microCT images due to its specific liver uptake. For a lesion size of 1 mm diameter, the variability in between two scans was 27.7 HU (P < .05) and the variability for different planes of one scan was 19.8 HU (P < .05).DHOG yields a very good visualization of the liver and delineation of the surrounding structures with a long plateau. It is a very suitable contrast agent for liver imaging in mice for microCT imaging. The presented protocol provides a high reproducibility for lesion detection with a relatively low radiation dose.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1016/j.acra.2007.10.007](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2007.10.007)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000253789000009](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000253789000009)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 18280932](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280932)\nOptical imaging (OI) is an easy, fast and inexpensive tool for in vivo monitoring of new stem cell based therapies. The technique is based on ex vivo labeling of stem cells with a fluorescent dye, subsequent intravenous injection of the labeled cells and visualization of their accumulation in specific target organs or pathologies. The presented technique demonstrates how we label human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) by simple incubation with the lipophilic fluorescent dye DiD (C67H103CIN2O3S) and how we label human embryonic stem cells (hESC) with the FDA approved fluorescent dye Indocyanine Green (ICG). The uptake mechanism is via adherence and diffusion of the lypophilic dye across the phospholipid cell membrane bilayer. The labeling efficiency is usually improved if the cells are incubated with the dye in serum-free media as opposed to incubation in serum-containing media.

A non-invasive method to monitor the transplanted stem cells repeatedly in vivo would greatly enhance our ability to understand the mechanisms that control stem cell death and identify trophic factors and signaling pathways that improve stem cell engraftment. MR imaging has been proven to be an effective tool for the in vivo depiction of stem cells with near microscopic anatomical resolution. In order to detect stem cells with MR, the cells have to be labeled with cell specific MR contrast agents. For this purpose, iron oxide nanoparticles, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIO), are applied, because of their high sensitivity for cell detection and their excellent biocompatibility. SPIO particles are composed of an iron oxide core and a dextran, carboxydextran or starch coat, and function by creating local field inhomogeneities, that cause a decreased signal on T2-weighted MR images. This presentation will demonstrate techniques for labeling of stem cells with clinically applicable MR contrast agents for subsequent non-invasive in vivo tracking of the labeled cells with MR imaging.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.3791/685](https://dx.doi.org/10.3791/685)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 19066574](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19066574)\nView details for\n[PubMedCentralID PMC2586865](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2586865)\nTo review a historical cohort of consecutively accrued patients with high-risk neuroblastoma treated with intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) to determine the therapeutic effect and late complications of this treatment.Between 1986 and 2002, 31 patients with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma were treated with IORT as part of multimodality therapy. Their medical records were reviewed to determine the outcome and complications. Kaplan-Meier probability estimates of local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival at 36 months after diagnosis were recorded.Intraoperative radiotherapy to the primary site and associated lymph nodes achieved excellent local control at a median follow-up of 44 months. The 3-year estimate of the local recurrence rate was 15%, less than that of most previously published series. Only 1 of 22 patients who had undergone gross total resection developed recurrence at the primary tumor site. The 3-year estimate of local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival was 85%, 47%, and 60%, respectively. Side effects attributable to either the disease process or multimodality treatment were observed in 7 patients who developed either hypertension or vascular stenosis. These late complications resulted in the death of 2 patients.Intraoperative radiotherapy at the time of primary resection offers effective local control in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Compared with historical controls, IORT achieved comparable control and survival rates while avoiding many side effects associated with external beam radiotherapy in young children. Although complications were observed, additional analysis is needed to determine the relative contributions of the disease process and specific components of the multimodality treatment to these adverse events.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.04.006](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.04.006)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000249943000030](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000249943000030)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 17517478](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17517478)\nThe purpose of this study was to label human monocytes with Gadofluorine M by simple incubation for subsequent cell depiction at 1.5 and 3 T. Gadofluorine M displays a high r(1) relaxivity and is spontaneously phagocytosed by macrophages. Human monocytes were incubated with Gadofluorine M-Cy at varying concentrations and incubation times and underwent MR imaging at 1.5 and 3 T at increasing time intervals after the labeling procedure. R1-relaxation rates and r1 relaxivities of the labeled cells and non-labeled controls were determined. Cellular contrast agent uptake was examined by fluorescence microscopy and quantified by ICP-AES. Efficient cell labeling was achieved after incubation of the cells with 25 mM Gd Gadofluorine M for 12 h, resulting in a maximal uptake of 0.3 fmol Gd/cell without impairment of cell viability. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed internalization of the fluorescent contrast agent by monocytes. The r1 relaxivity of the labeled cells was 137 mM(-1)s(-1) at 1.5 T and 80.46 mM(-1)s(-1) at 3 T.

MR imaging of both knees was performed at 2 T before and up to 2 h and 24 h after injection (p.i.) of P866 (n = 3 dose finding study and n = 6, 0.02 mmol Gd/kg), the non-FR targeted P866 analog P1001 (n = 3 at 24 h after P866-administration, 0.02 mmol Gd/kg) or Gd-DOTA (n = 6, 0.1 mmol Gd/kg).

DeltaSI-data and T(1)-relaxation times of arthritic knees and contralateral normal knees were determined. Folate receptor expression was confirmed with histopathology. All three contrast agents showed an initial perfusion effect with significantly higher DeltaSI-data of arthritic knees compared with normal knees (p < 0.05). In addition, P866, but not P1001 or Gd-DOTA, showed a prolonged enhancement of the synovitis. Compared with precontrast values, the T(1)-relaxation times of inflamed synovia were significantly decreased at 2 h p.i. of P866 (p < 0.05), but not P1001 or Gd-DOTA (p > 0.05). Histopathology confirmed the presence of folate receptors in the inflamed joints, but not normal joints.

The latter appear to be very similar in many aspects to the human RA. We show the potential for iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the macrophage content in the arthritic synovial membranes. The results of our own research, as well as those of other research groups, are presented and discussed.MRI after the intravenous (i.v.) administration of iron oxides enables the depiction of macrophage content in arthritic synovial membranes in AIA through the effects of the intracellular compartmentalisation of iron oxide particles. These effects can be demonstrated in 24-h delayed images after i.v. contrast application, on T2-weighted spin-echo or turbo-spin-echo sequences, and especially on T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequences. The signal effects are not only apparent in high field strength (4.7 Tesla) but also on 1.5 Tesla clinical scanners.The use of iron oxides enables the determination of the macrophage content in synovitis in animals with AIA. This parameter represents a potential marker to determine disease activity, and possibly represents a marker to evaluate the effectiveness of specific therapies in human RA. Current knowledge of iron oxide-enhanced MRI is limited to animal models. The clinical evaluation of this new method in patients with RA has not yet been performed. However, based on the considerations presented here, significant progress in the diagnostic work-up of RA can be expected.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00117-006-1453-9](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00117-006-1453-9)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000244402700007](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000244402700007)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 17221243](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17221243)\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of inflammation detection in an antigen-induced arthritis model using fluorescent leukocytes and optical imaging.Antigen-mediated monoarthritis was induced in the right knee of 12 Sprague-Dawley rats.

Animals in group II (N = 6) were imaged before injection and at 3, 23, 43, and 123 minutes p.i. using identical sequences. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and relative enhancement (DeltaSI%) of arthritic and normal synovium were determined from region-of-interest (ROI) measurements in consensus reading by two experienced radiologists. Data were tested for significant differences between the two agents and between the arthritic and normal knees using a mixed-effect model and F-tests (P < 0.05). Joints were processed for histopathology as the gold standard.USPIO and Gd-DTPA showed significant enhancement differences (P < 0.001). USPIO provided a progressive and persistent enhancement of arthritic joints while Gd-DTPA provided an early and rapidly declining enhancement.

Immunostains demonstrated an USPIO compartmentalization in macrophages in the arthritic synovium.Based on the relatively small number of animals in our study group, inflammation in antigen-induced arthritis can be equally detected and characterized with any of the three USPIOs evaluated.\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000234240800007](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000234240800007)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 16355039](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16355039)\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.07.235](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.07.235)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000241221600191](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000241221600191)\nTumor angiogenesis imaging should provide non-invasive assays of tumor vascular characteristics to supplement the now conventional diagnostic imaging goals of depicting tumor location, size, and morphology. This article will review the current status of angiogenesis imaging approaches, considering ultrasound, CT, MR, SPECT, PET and optical techniques with attention to their respective capabilities and limitations. As a group, these imaging methods have some potential to depict and quantify tumor microvascular features, including those considered to be functionally associated with tumor angiogenesis. Additionally, new molecule-specific imaging techniques may serve to depict those biochemical pathways and regulatory events that control blood vessel growth and proliferation. Non-invasive monitoring of anti-angiogenic therapies has great appeal and should find wide application for defining tumor microvascular and metabolic changes, because treatment-related changes in tumor morphology tend to occur rather late and are non-specific. Future developments are likely to include \"fusion\" or \"hybrid\" imaging methods. Superimposed data from MR imaging with spectroscopy, PET with CT, and PET with MR should be able to integrate advantages of different modalities yielding comprehensive information about tumor structure, function and microenvironment.\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000238779600007](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000238779600007)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 16842165](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16842165)\nTo categorize the disease severity of mammary tumors in an animal model through the application of a novel tumor permeability mixture model within a hierarchical modeling framework.Thirty-six rats with mammary tumors of varying grade were imaged via dynamic contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI using albumin-(Gd-DTPA)30. Time-dependent contrast agent concentration curves for blood and tumor tissue were obtained and a mathematical model of microvascular blood-tissue exchange was developed under the hypothesis that endothelial integrity is disrupted in a manner proportional to the degree of malignancy, with benign tumors showing no disruption of the vasculature endothelium. This permeability model was incorporated into a statistical model for the benign and malignant tumor subgroups that enabled automatic subject classification. The structural and statistical models were implemented using the software Nonlinear Mixed Effects Modeling (NONMEM) to statistically separate subjects into the two subgroups.Individual tumor classifications (as benign or malignant) were evaluated against the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson microscopic scoring method as applied to the tumor histology of each subject. The model-based classification resulted in 90.9% sensitivity, 92.9% specificity, and 91.7% accuracy.Mixture model analysis provides a robust method for subject classification without user intervention and bias. Although the present results are promising, additional research is needed to further evaluate this technique for diagnostic purposes.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1002/jmri.20412](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmri.20412)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000232317700014](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000232317700014)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 16161077](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16161077)\nThe objective is to compare three different ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxides (USPIOs) for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of normal bone marrow in rodents.Femoral bone marrow in 18 Sprague-Dawley rats was examined by using MR imaging before and up to 2 and 24 hours postinjection (PI) of 200 mumol of Fe/kg of SHU555C (n = 6), ferumoxtran-10 (n = 6), or ferumoxytol (n = 6), using T1-weighted (50 ms/1.7 ms/60 degrees = repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]/flip angle) and T2*-weighted (100 ms/15 ms/38 degrees = TR/TE/flip angle) three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled echo sequences.

Twenty-five patients with chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis underwent both dynamic gadopentetate- and ferumoxides-enhanced MRI studies of the liver for HCC detection on the same day. MR data of both studies were retrospectively and independently analyzed. Two observers determined in consensus the grade of diffuse fibrotic liver changes (mild, moderate or severe) and the number of focal lesions. HCCs were confirmed by histology (n=22) and/or follow-up studies for at least six months (n=64). Differences in results obtained from both MR data sets were tested for significance with the McNemar's test (p<0.05). Ferumoxides-enhanced MR images detected 84 of 99 hepatic lesions, including 82 of 86 HCCs and 2 false positive, nonmalignant lesions, while Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR images detected 92 of 99 hepatic lesions, including 81 of 86 HCCs and 11 false positive, nonmalignant lesions. Sensitivity of MRI for detection of HCCs was not significantly different between ferumoxides-enhanced (95.3%; p>0.05) and Gd-DTPA-enhanced scans (94.2%). Gd-DTPA- and ferumoxides-enhanced MRI perform equally well for HCC detection.

Parental NK-92 cells and genetically modified HER2/neu specific NK-92-scFv(FRP5)-zeta cells, expressing a chimeric antigen receptor specific to the tumor-associated ErbB2 (HER2/neu) antigen, were labeled with ferumoxides and ferucarbotran using simple incubation, lipofection and electroporation techniques. Labeling efficiency was evaluated by MR imaging, Prussian blue stains and spectrometry. Subsequently, ferucarbotran-labeled NK-92-scFv(FRP5)-zeta (n=3) or parental NK-92 cells were intravenously injected into the tail vein of six mice with HER2/neu-positive NIH 3T3 mammary tumors, implanted in the mammary fat pad.

Mononuclear peripheral blood cells from GCSF-primed patients were labeled with gadophrin-2 (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany), a paramagnetic and fluorescent metalloporphyrin, using established transfection techniques with cationic liposomes. The labeled cells were evaluated in vitro with electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry.

Five additional mice served as controls: three mice were untreated controls and two mice were investigated after injection of unlabeled cells. The contrast agent effect was determined quantitatively for MR imaging by calculating signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) data. After completion of in vivo imaging studies, fluorescence microscopy of excised organs was performed. Intracellular cytoplasmatic uptake of gadophrin-2 was confirmed by electron microscopy.

However, angiogenesis inhibitors may alter tumor microvessel structure and transendothelial permeability thereby reducing tumoral delivery of cytotoxic agents. The aim of this study was to estimate quantitatively the apparent permeability-surface area product (K(PS)) in tumors to a macromolecular contrast medium (MMCM), to follow changes in K(PS) induced by antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), and to correlate the findings with tumor accumulation of cisplatin, a highly protein-bound cytotoxin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a small unbound cytotoxin.Dynamic MRI enhanced with a MMCM (albumin-(Gd-DTPA)(30)) was analyzed using a two-compartment tumor tissue model (plasma and interstitial water) to quantitatively estimate K(PS). These estimates of K(PS) were correlated with cytotoxic drug accumulations in the tumors.Anti-VEGF treatment reduced K(PS) to MMCM in tumor tissue from 0.013 mL h(-1) cm(-3) (n = 9) at baseline to 0.003 mL h(-1) cm(-3) (n = 9) 24 h later (p <.05). The K(PS) values correlated significantly (r(2) =.78; p <.0001) with the tumor cisplatin accumulation. No correlation (r(2) =.001; p =.89) was found between K(PS) and tumor accumulation of the substantially smaller 5-FU molecule.MMCM-enhanced MRI can be used to detect and estimate changes in K(PS) to this contrast agent following a single dose of anti-VEGF antibody. The decline in K(PS) induced by this inhibitor of angiogenesis is associated with reduced tumor concentration of a protein-bound cytotoxin, similar in molecular weight to the contrast agent. MRI assays of microvascular status as performed here may be useful to clinically monitor responses to anti-angiogenesis drugs and to optimize the choice and timing of cytotoxic drug administration.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1080/10739680490457665](https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10739680490457665)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000222086100001](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000222086100001)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 15280064](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15280064)\nTo investigate use of the macromolecular contrast agent feruglose for differentiating and grading of human benign and malignant breast tumors on the basis of their microvascular characteristics.Sixty-three women with 63 primary breast lesions were examined with dynamic T1-weighted gradient-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging after intravenous injection of feruglose. A two-compartment unidirectional kinetic model applied to the dynamic data yielded estimates of the endothelial transfer coefficient, KPS, and the fractional plasma volume of the tumors. These MR imaging-derived parameters were correlated with the histologic tumor grade and quantified according to the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) score by means of Pearson product moment correlation analyses. Differences between malignant and nonmalignant breast lesions with respect to KPS for feruglose were evaluated by means of the chi2 test and by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.Histologic analysis revealed 26 benign and 37 malignant tumors. A moderate yet statistically significant correlation between KPS and SBR score was found (R = 0.496, P <.001). No significant correlation was observed between fractional plasma volume and SBR score (R = 0.085, P =.507). The KPS values were zero for 19 (73%) of the 26 benign tumors and were greater than zero for 27 (73%) of the 37 carcinomas. This distribution was significantly different (chi2 = 13.035, P =.001). With the criterion KPS > 0 in carcinomas, sensitivity was 0.73, specificity was 0.73, and the positive predictive value was 0.79.Quantitative measures of tumor microvascular permeability can be used for breast tumor characterization.

All breast tumors were surgically excised within 1-6 days (mean, 2.5 days) after completion of the magnetic resonance studies. Data were analyzed by measuring quantitative enhancement data and qualitatively by categorizations of the shape of the tumor enhancement curves. Group differences between quantitative data of the two contrast agents and between benign and malignant tumors were evaluated using a two-tailed paired-sample t test. Differences in curve type distribution between benign and malignant tumors were tested with the chi2 test.Histopathology showed a spectrum of 10 benign and nine malignant breast lesions: five mastopathies, two fibroadenomas, two chronic inflammations, and one papillomatosis, as well as five invasive ductal carcinomas and four invasive lobular carcinomas. Substantial differences were observed between feruglose- and gadopentetate-enhanced images: the mean tumor deltaSI(%) peak enhancement and wash-in rate were significantly higher for gadopentetate- as compared with feruglose-enhanced images (P < .05). Using either contrast agent, morphologic enhancement characteristics showed a considerable overlap between benign and malignant breast lesions. However, the kinetic enhancement profiles of benign and malignant lesions were significantly different based on feruglose-enhanced data (chi2 = 9.017; P = .0027) but not gadopentetate-enhanced data (chi2 = 2.239; P = .3264).Compared with gadopentetate, the new blood pool agent feruglose provided an improved characterization of the evaluated breast lesions; however, at the cost of weaker overall tumor enhancement.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1016/S1076-6332(03)00248-4](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1076-6332(03)00248-4)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000186307500004](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000186307500004)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 14626298](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14626298)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000185600700051](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000185600700051)\nTo label human hematopoietic progenitor cells with various magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agents and to obtain 1.5-T MR images of them.Hematopoietic progenitor cells, labeled with ferumoxides, ferumoxtran, magnetic polysaccharide nanoparticles-transferrin, P7228 liposomes, and gadopentetate dimeglumine liposomes underwent MR imaging with T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo and fast field-echo sequences.

The aim of this study was to visualise embryonic and neuronal stem cells with standard contrast agents using a conventional clinical 1.5-Tesla scanner. We therefore modified standard transfection protocols including lipofection (Lipofectin and Lipofectamine) and calcium phosphate transfection for the efficient uptake of paramagnetic particles [gadolinium-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA)] in stem cells. Using this approach we obtained intracellular labelling efficiencies of up to 83%. Neither the proliferation capacity nor the differentiation efficiency was affected. Identical differentiation of labelled and unlabelled embryonic and neuronal cells was observed. The established labelling techniques used in this study displayed high labelling efficiencies in embryonic and neuronal stem cells without any alterations of cellular biology; therefore this approach might be a suitable method for targeting stem cells.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00259-002-1110-0](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00259-002-1110-0)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000184644800016](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000184644800016)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 12567250](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12567250)\nThe authors evaluated the use of T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with Gadophrin-3 enhancement and of plain T2-weighted MR imaging to detect and quantify breast tumor necrosis.Twenty EMT-6 tumors (mouse mammary sarcoma), implanted into the mammary fat pad of BALB/c-AnNCrl mice, underwent MR imaging with plain T2-weighted and T1-weighted fast field echo sequences before and 24 hours after injection of Gadophrin-3, a new necrosis-avid contrast agent. Tumor necrosis on MR images was quantified by means of a dedicated segmentation program and was correlated with histologic findings.In all tumors a central necrosis was revealed by histopathologic analysis, and central enhancement was seen with Gadophrin-3 on T1-weighted images. Small tumors (diameter, < 1 cm) showed an inhomogeneous central enhancement, whereas larger tumors (diameter, > 1 cm) enhanced mainly in the periphery of necrotic tissue. Plain T2-weighted images showed a hyperintense central area in only three of 20 cases with a large central necrosis.Gadophrin-3-enhanced T1-weighted images are superior to plain T2-weighted images for the detection of necrosis in a murine tumor xenograft model.\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000182566800003](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000182566800003)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 12755535](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12755535)\nMacromolecular contrast media (MMCM) encompass a new class of diagnostic drugs that can be applied with dynamic MRI to extract both physiologic and morphologic information in breast lesions. Kinetic analysis of dynamic MMCM-enhanced MR data in breast tumor patients provides useful estimates of tumor blood volume and microvascular permeability, typically increased in cancer. These tumor characteristics can be applied to differentiate benign from malignant lesions, to define the angiogenesis status of cancers, and to monitor tumor response to therapy. The most immediate challenge to the development of MMCM-enhanced mammography is the identification of those candidate compounds that demonstrate the requisite long intravascular distribution and have the high tolerance necessary for clinical use.

Eighteen patients with cancer of the hematopoietic system underwent MRI of the spine before and after infusion of ferumoxides ( n=9) and ferumoxtran ( n=9) using T1- and T2-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) and short tau inversion recovery sequences (STIR). In all patients diffuse or multifocal bone marrow infiltration was suspected, based on iliac crest biopsy and imaging such as conventional radiographs, MRI, and positron emission tomography. In addition, all patients had a therapy-induced normocellular ( n=7) or hypercellular ( n=11) reconversion of the normal non-neoplastic bone marrow. The MRI data were analyzed by measuring pre- and post-contrast signal intensities (SI) of hematopoietic and neoplastic marrow and by calculating the enhancement as deltaSI(%) data and the tumor-to-bone-marrow contrast as contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR). Changes in bone marrow signal intensity after iron oxide administration were more pronounced on STIR images as compared with T1- and T2-weighted TSE images. The STIR images showed a strong signal decline of normal and hypercellular marrow 45-60 min after iron oxide infusion, but no or only a minor signal decline of neoplastic bone marrow lesions; thus, deltaSI% data were significantly higher in normal and hypercellular reconverted marrow compared with neoplastic bone marrow lesions ( p<0.05). Additionally, the contrast between focal or multifocal neoplastic bone marrow infiltration and normal bone marrow, quantified by CNR data, increased significantly on post-contrast STIR images compared with precontrast images ( p<0.05). Superparamagnetic iron oxides are taken up by normal and hypercellular reconverted bone marrow, but not by neoplastic bone marrow lesions, thereby providing significantly different enhancement patterns on T2-weighted MR images; thus, superparamagnetic iron oxides are useful to differentiate normal and neoplastic bone marrow and to increase the bone marrow-to-tumor contrast.\nView details for\n[DOI 10.1007/s00330-001-1270-5](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-001-1270-5)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000176197400041](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000176197400041)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 12042968](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12042968)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000175560800128](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000175560800128)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000175560800129](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000175560800129)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000174029400014](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000174029400014)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 11898088](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11898088)\nThe aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic ability of positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) in the detection of recurrences from malignant primary bone tumors compared with conventional imaging.In 27 patients (6 osteosarcomas, 21 Ewing's sarcomas), 41 FDG-PET examinations performed for diagnosis or exclusion of recurrent disease were evaluated.

Several microvascular parameters were compared: the endothelial transfer coefficient (K(PS)), a measure of microvascular permeability; the fractional plasma volume (fPV), and the plasma equivalent volume. Each MR imaging parameter was correlated with histopathologic findings.With Gadomer-17, the mean values for K(PS) and fPV were significantly greater in carcinomas than in fibroadenomas (P < .004 and .04, respectively).

A similar trend was apparent in terms of accuracy for specific diagnosis: values ranged from 49% and 62% on unenhanced images alone, to 76% and 70% on combined unenhanced and dynamic images (p<0.001, p = 0.06), and to 75% and 70% on inclusion of delayed images (p<0.001, p = 0.12). The sensitivity for lesion detection increased from 77% and 81% on unenhanced images alone, to 87% and 85% on combined unenhanced and dynamic images (p = 0.001, p = 0.267), and to 92% and 89% when all images were considered (p<0.001, p = 0.01).Contrast-enhanced dynamic MR imaging with gadobenate dimeglumine significantly increases sensitivity and accuracy over unenhanced imaging for the characterization of focal hepatic lesions, and delayed MR imaging contributes to the improved detection of lesions.\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000089490500035](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000089490500035)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 11000175](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11000175)\nThe purpose of this study was to compare positron emission tomography using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) and technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scintigraphy in the detection of osseous metastases from malignant primary osseous tumours. In 70 patients with histologically proven malignant primary bone tumours (32 osteosarcomas, 38 Ewing's sarcomas), 118 FDG-PET examinations were evaluated. FDG-PET scans were analysed with regard to osseous metastases in comparison with bone scintigraphy. The reference methods for both imaging modalities were histopathological analysis, morphological imaging [additional conventional radiography, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] and/or clinical follow-up over 6-64 months (median 20 months). In 21 examinations (18%) reference methods revealed 54 osseous metastases (49 from Ewing's sarcomas, five from osteosarcomas). FDG-PET had a sensitivity of 0.90, a specificity of 0.96 and an accuracy of 0.95 on an examination-based analysis. Comparable values for bone scintigraphy were 0.71, 0.92 and 0.88. On a lesion-based analysis the sensitivity of FDG-PET and bone scintigraphy was 0.80 and 0.72, respectively. Analysing only Ewing's sarcoma patients, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FDG-PET and bone scan were 1.00, 0.96 and 0.97 and 0.68, 0.87 and 0.82, respectively (examination-based analysis). None of the five osseous metastases from osteosarcoma were detected by FDG-PET, but all of them were true-positive using bone scintigraphy. In conclusion, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FDG-PET in the detection of osseous metastases from Ewing's sarcomas are superior to those of bone scintigraphy. However, in the detection of osseous metastases from osteosarcoma, FDG-PET seems to be less sensitive than bone scintigraphy.\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000089201700006](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000089201700006)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 11007511](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11007511)\nTo evaluate gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) for dynamic and delayed magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of focal liver lesions.In 126 of 214 patients, MR imaging was performed before Gd-BOPTA administration, immediately after bolus administration of a 0.05- mmol/kg dose of Gd-BOPTA, and 60-120 minutes after an additional intravenously infused 0.05-mmol/kg dose. In 88 patients, imaging was performed before and 60-120 minutes after a single, intravenously infused 0.1-mmol/kg dose. T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo and T1-weighted gradient-echo images were acquired. On-site and blinded off-site reviewers prospectively evaluated all images. Intraoperative ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) during arterial portography, and/or CT with iodized oil served as the reference methods in 110 patients.Significantly more lesions were detected on combined pre- and postcontrast images compared with on precontrast images alone (P <. 01). All reviewers reported a decreased mean size of the smallest detected lesion and improved lesion conspicuity on postcontrast images.

One hundred cobalt-base screws and 24 steel plates were used for osteosynthesis in these specimens. Artificial lesions were produced in 50 screws, such as osteolysis near the screws (mimicking lysis due to infection, tumor, or loosening), displacement of the screws, as well as fractures of the screws. All specimens were examined using eight different CT protocols: four conventional (CCT) and four spiral (SCT) CT protocols with different milliampere-second values (130 and 480 mAs for CCT, 130 and 300 mAs for SCT), kilovolt potentials (120 and 140 kVp), and slice thicknesses (2 and 5 mm). The images were analyzed by three observers using a standard window (maximum window width 4,000 HU) and ECTS (maximum window width 40,000 HU). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed, and image quality was assessed according to a five level scale.Metal artifacts were significantly reduced using ECTS (p < 0.05). The highest diagnostic performance was obtained using ECTS with the thinnest slice thickness. Metal artifacts were more pronounced using SCT. In this experimental model, exposure dose and kilovolt potential had no significant impact on diagnostic performance (p > 0.05).ECTS improved imaging of metal implants. In this study, no significant effects of exposure dose and kilovolt potential were noted. Metal artifacts were more prominent using SCT than using CCT.\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000084876600029](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000084876600029)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 10667677](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10667677)\nOur aim was to quantify irradiation-induced permeability alterations of the blood-bone marrow barrier (BMB) with dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The standard small molecular contrast agent, gadoterate meglumine, and a new macromolecular contrast agent, carboxymethyldextran-Gd-DOTA (CMD-Gd-DOTA), were compared. Twenty New Zealand white rabbits underwent MRI of the bone marrow before and 1-2 days after total body irradiation (TBI). Dynamic, repetitive T1-weighted MRI was performed before and after injection of either 0.05 mmol/kg BW CMD-Gd-DOTA (n = 10) or 0.5 mmol/kg BW gadoterate (n = 10). Bone marrow contrast enhancement was quantified as delta signal intensity: DeltaSI = |(SIpost - SIpre) / SIpre| * 100%. All MRI data were compared with the histopathologic BMB ultrastructure. Dynamic bone marrow DeltaSI data steadily increased after CMD-Gd-DOTA injection, while blood DeltaSI data slightly decreased. This bone marrow contrast enhancement, indicative of contrast agent extravasation, was significantly higher and prolonged in the irradiated group as compared to non-irradiated controls (P < 0.05) and corresponded to irradiation-induced alterations of the BMB ultrastructure seen on electron microscopy. By contrast, DeltaSI data of non-irradiated and irradiated marrow were not significantly different following gadoterate injection (P > 0.05). We conclude that irradiation-induced alterations in BMB permeability could be reliably assessed with dynamic MRI, using the new macromolecular contrast agent CMD-Gd-DOTA.

Twenty New Zealand white rabbits (n = 10 following total body irradiation and n = 10 controls) underwent AMI-227-enhanced MRI. Pulse sequences included dynamic fast low-angle shot (FLASH; TR/TE 50/4 msec, flip angle 60 degrees) MRI and static T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) and turbo-SE sequences of the lumbar spine and sacrum. Bone marrow enhancement was quantified as delta signal intensity (SI) (%) =|[(SIpost - SIpre)/SIpre] x 100%| and compared with histopathology, including iron stains and electron microscopy. Dynamic bone marrow deltaSI (%) data steadily increased up to 10-15 minutes after AMI-227 administration, while blood deltaSI (%) data stayed nearly constant, histologically corresponding to iron oxide leakage into the bone marrow interstitium. This bone marrow contrast enhancement increased significantly following irradiation, corresponding to alterations of the endothelial lining of the bone marrow sinusoids. Late postcontrast images exhibited a significant positive T1 enhancement and negative T2 enhancement of the normal bone marrow, which further increased with irradiation due to increased RES activity. Irradiation-induced changes in bone marrow physiology could be reliably assessed with AMI-227-enhanced MRI.\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000083418000005](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000083418000005)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 10331759](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10331759)\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID 000080105800393](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000080105800393)\nTumor blood volume (BV), subject to both morphologic and physiologic influences, can be measured using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aims of this study were to determine whether MRI enhanced with a macromolecular contrast medium (MMCM) could resolve differences in BV between different tumor types, between different regions within tumors, and within the same tumor in life and after death. Tumor BV estimates were based on the MRI signal intensity responses in the tumors and in reference venous blood following enhancement with a blood pool MMCM using two mammary adenocarcinoma models. Estimates of BV were made before and immediately following death. An in vitro measurement of tumor gadolinium concentration following death was correlated with MRI enhancement. Statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in MRI-estimated tumor BV between tumor subtypes, between in vivo and postmortem measurements, and between the tumor periphery and tumor centers.

The value of E was determined by using a two-compartment tissue model in which the endothelial transfer coefficient, K(PS) (ml x min(-1) x cc(-1) of tissue), was estimated from the model fitted to changes in R1 relaxation time (deltaR1; s(-1)) measured by dynamic three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled magnetic resonance imaging after injection of 0.1 mmol x kg(-1) of gadopentetate dimeglumine. The plasma flow rate through the tumor capillaries, Fp, (ml x min(-1) x g(-1) of tissue), was independently measured with fluorescent microspheres. E could be calculated by the relationship, E = K(PS)/Fp. The mean E for gadopentetate in the R3230 tumor was 0.197 +/- 0.118 with a range of 0.123-0.454.

Twenty-five artificial cartilage lesions were created in the knee joints of 10 rabbits. These specimens and seven specimens without lesions were imaged at 1.5 T using a three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence with varying slice thickness, field of view and matrix. A total of 404 corresponding images were selected, 50% with and 50% without cartilage lesions. Six radiologists scored all images according to five levels of confidence and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Lesion size and depth were compared to the corresponding pathological specimen sections. Additionally SNR ratios were calculated. ROC analysis of pooled data from all readers showed the highest area under the ROC curve for the sequence with the highest spatial resolution, while the diagnostic performance was significantly lower in the other sequences (p <0.01). Assessment of the lesion size and depth was correct in 45% and 40% respectively with the highest resolution and in 29% and 23% with the lowest resolution. SNR ratios decreased with increasing spatial resolution. In conclusion this study shows that increasing spatial resolution improves diagnostic performance in cartilage lesions, though SNR decreases substantially.

Gd-EOB-DTPA (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) was administered as an IV bolus (12.5, 25, or 50 micromol/kg body weight) with dynamic T1-weighted MRI during the distribution and cellular uptake of the contrast agent at multiple time points up to 45 min post contrast. Dynamic changes in tumor signal intensity, tumor-liver contrast, enhancement patterns, side effects, and adverse events were evaluated. Monitoring of vital signs revealed no significant changes during bolus injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA. Liver metastases demonstrated an inhomogeneous uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA during the distribution phase with a washout effect on delayed images > 3 min and highest tumor-liver contrast 20 and 45 min post contrast. Hepatocellular carcinomas showed prolonged enhancement as compared with metastases and hemangiomas. Hemangiomas exhibited an early peripheral-nodular enhancement with subsequent partial or complete filling, persisting enhancement < 10 min following injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA, and delayed washout as compared with liver metastases.

The CNR values were significantly higher on TIRSE images as compared with conventional images (p < 0. 05). Forty-two neurologically abnormal patients displayed a normal myelination on all sequences, whereas 23 showed an abnormal myelination. The TIRSE sequence provided a sensitive and specific depiction of an abnormal myelination in all of these patients.

All patients prospectively underwent MRI ( +/- gadolinium-DTPA ) and SCT (3-phase examination) as preoperative diagnostic imaging studies, and laparotomy was carried out within 7 days, irrespective of the MRI or SCT findings. SCT and MR studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, without knowing the results of the surgical exploration.

Although rare, NHL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skull tumors in children.\nView details for\n[PubMedID 8677328](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8677328)\nTo investigate the diagnostic and clinical usefulness of a new non-ionic, hydrophilic gadolinium (III) chelate [Gd(HP-DO3A), gadoteridol, ProHance] and to compare it with Gd-DTPA (gadopentetate dimeglumine, Magnevist).In a Phase III clinical trial, 20 patients with rheumatic joint disease were examined before and after intravenous administration of gadoteridol in two different doses (0.1 and 0.3 mmol/kg bodyweight). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 1.5 T with T1-weighted FLASH and T2-weighted spin echo sequences. Fourteen patients were examined with gadopentetate dimeglumine for comparison. Dynamic changes of signal intensity in the joints and muscle tissue were determined quantitatively.No significant changes in cardiovascular data and no adverse effects occurred after injection of gadoteridol. The 0.3 mmol/kg dose showed no advantage in diagnostic contrast over the 0.1 mmol/kg dose. No significant differences (p > 0.01) were noted between gadoteridol and gadopentetate dimeglumine in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis.Gadoteridol proved useful in the detection of early rheumatoid arthritis. No significant differences were observed between the two gadoteridol doses. There were no diagnostically relevant differences between gadoteridol and gadopentetate dimeglumine.\nView details for\n[PubMedID 8867431](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8867431)\nThe purpose of this work is to describe our initial clinical experience (in 66 patients) with Resovist and Eovist, two new liver-specific MR contrast agents. We focus our report on safety aspects, dose finding, and optimization and technical parameters. Both contrast agents were well tolerated and improved the detectability of focal liver lesions. With Resovist, postcontrast MRI may be started as early as 10 min following injection. The dose of 8 mumol Fe/kg bodyweight was sufficient to achieve diagnostic tumor-liver contrast levels. Since Eovist can also be administered as a bolus, dynamic enhancement patterns may be studied for tumor characterization as well. Breath-hold T1-weighted FLASH images were superior to other T1-weighted techniques with and without fat saturation.\nView details for\n[PubMedID 8867429](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8867429)\nTo evaluate the efficacy of high-dose Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, Omniscan) as a contrast for magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and the use of high-dose dynamic studies for predicting the response to pre-operative chemotherapy.Examinations were performed in 22 patients with suspected malignant bone tumor on a 1.5 T system. In 8 cases a follow-up examination was done after preoperative chemotherapy. Static studies included Pd- and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences as well as T1-weighted spin-echo sequences, obtained pre- and post-contrast. Dynamic studies were performed using a FLASH 2D-gradient-echo sequence (TR 40 ms/TE 10 ms, 90 degrees flip angle) every 20 s after intravenous bolus injection of Gd-DTPA-BMA (0.3 mmol/kg body weight). MR images were evaluated qualitatively by visual assessment of conspicuity size, extraosseous delineation and structure of the lesion and quantitatively by measurement of the signal intensities and calculation of the relative increase in signal intensity.Qualitative image analysis showed best demonstration of the lesions on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Comparison of T1-weighted pre- and postcontrast spin-echo sequences revealed significantly better assessment of tumor structure after administration of contrast media. After preoperative chemotherapy, all responders showed a markedly stronger reduction in relative increase in signal intensity in dynamic studies compared to nonresponders.Gd-DTPA-BMA is effective for magnetic resonance imaging of musculoskeletal lesions and improves assessment of the tumor structure. Dynamic studies may help to predict the response to preoperative chemotherapy.\nView details for\n[PubMedID 8867432](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8867432)\nAccurate detection of liver metastases in patients with known primary tumors is often essential for therapeutic decision making. Compared to conventional contrast media-enhanced CT unenhanced MRI seems to be slightly superior for the detection of small focal liver lesions. However, intraoperative US and CTAP show higher sensitivities for lesion detection but use of these techniques is limited because of their invasive character. The new superparamagnetic MR contrast medium ENDOREM improves the number of liver lesions detected significantly as compared to unenhanced MRI. Furthermore, as shown recently, ENDOREM-enhanced MRI may be as sensitive as CTAP. Thus, ENDOREM is useful for preoperative staging of liver tumors due to improvement in lesion detection and delineation of the hepatic vascular system.\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID A1995TH49100004](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/A1995TH49100004)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 8588031](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8588031)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 8527762](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8527762)\nThe clinical tolerability and diagnostic value of Resovist as a new superparamagnetic iron oxide contrast medium was studied in 30 patients with malignant focal liver lesions (28 metastases, 2 HCC) within a phase II multicenter study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 1.0 Tesla with T1-weighted FLASH- and T2-weighted spin echo sequences before and following intravenous injection of Resovist at three different dose groups (4, 8 and 16 mumol Fe/kg). Liver signal intensity was significantly reduced on post-contrast images, while malignant focal liver lesions showed no signal changes. Resovist improved tumor liver contrast and lesion-conspicuity, especially for lesions smaller than 1 cm. The dose of 8 mumol Fe/kg was sufficient to achieve diagnostic tumor-liver contrast. Compared to images directly after injection, the number of detected lesions did not improve until 70 min later. There were no significant changes in vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure) or laboratory values until 72 h post-injection.\nView details for\n[PubMedID 7568792](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7568792)\nTo investigate the superparamagnetic iron oxide (Resovist) designed for contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the liver.A phase 2 trial was performed in 33 patients with no more than five known focal solid liver lesions. Resovist was administered intravenously at doses of 4, 8, and 16 mumol of iron per kilogram of body weight. Postcontrast 1.0-T imaging was started 30 minutes after injection.Resovist significantly (P < or = .05) decreased liver signal intensity and increased lesion-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N) and the number of detectable liver lesions: fast spin-echo (SE) (echo time, 90 msec) precontrast C/N, 11.7 +/- 7.9 [standard deviation]; postcontrast [8-mumol Fe/Kg] C/N, 29.2 +/- 14.2). The dose of 8 mumol Fe/kg was sufficient for the detection of focal liver lesions, and T2-weighted fast SE with an echo time of 90 msec was the overall best pulse sequence.Resovist is a safe contrast agent, and a dose of 8 mumol Fe/kg is sufficient to enhance detection of focal liver lesions at T2-weighted fast SE MR imaging.\nView details for\n[Web of Science ID A1995QU71700034](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/A1995QU71700034)\nView details for\n[PubMedID 7724772](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7724772)\nThis invited commentary discusses a recent article by Mohanty et al in Molecular Cancer Therapeutics about significant therapeutic efficacies of novel theranostic nanoparticles (TNPs) for the treatment of human brain cancers in mouse models. The TNPs were cleaved by enzymes in the tumor tissue, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-14), which lead to release of a highly potent therapeutic drug, azademethylcolchicine. Data showed that the TNPs caused selective toxic effects in MMP-14-expressing glioblastoma and not normal brain. In addition, the iron oxide nanoparticle backbone enabled in vivo drug tracking with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This commentary discusses previous efforts of MMP-targeted therapeutics as well as opportunities for further refinements of tumor enzyme-activatable TNPs. If successfully translated to clinical applications, the TNPs might hold substantial potential to improving cytotoxic indexes and long-term outcomes of patients with brain cancer compared to standard therapy.\nView details for\n[PubMedID 28929923](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28929923)", "language": null, "image":
