August 10, 2018. \uf0e32009 Diana Robins, Deborah Fein, & Marianne BartonPermissions for Use of the M-CHAT-R/FTM \nThe Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddle rs, Revised with Follow-Up (M-CHAT -R/F; Robins, Fein, & \nBarton, 2009) is a 2-stage parent-report screening tool to assess risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder \n(ASD). The M- CHAT -R/F is available for free download for clinical, research, and educational purposes. \nDownload of the M- CHAT -R/F and related material is authorized from www.mchatscreen.com . \nThe M- CHAT -R/F is a copyrighted instrument, and use of the M- CHAT -R/F must follow these guidelines: \n(1)Reprints/reproductions of the M-C HAT-R must include the copyright at the bottom (\uf0e3 2009  \nRobins, Fein, & Barton). No modifications can be made to items, instructions, or item order  without \npermission from the authors.\n(2)The M-C HAT-R must be used in its entirety. Evidence indicates that any subsets of items do not \ndemonstrate adequate psychometric properties.\n(3)Parties interested in reproducing the M-C HAT-R/F in print (e.g., a book or journal article) or \nelectronically for use by others (e.g., as part of digital medical record or other software packages)  \nmust contact Diana Robins to request permission (mchatscreen2009@gmail.com ).\n(4)If you are part of a medical practice, and you want to incorporate the first stage M-C HAT-R \nquestions into your own practice\u2019s electronic medical record (EMR), you are welcome to do so. \nHowever, if you ever want to distribute your EMR page outside of your practice, please contact \nDiana Robins to request a licensing agreement.  \nInstructions for Use \nThe M- CHAT -R can be administered and scored as part of a well-child care visit, and also can be used \nby specialists or other professionals to assess risk for ASD. The primary goal of the M- CHAT -R is to \nmaximize sensitivity, meaning to detect as many cases of ASD as possible.  Therefore, there is a high \nfalse positive rate, meaning that not all children who score at risk will be diagnosed with ASD. To \naddress this, we have developed the Follow-Up questions (M- CHAT -R/F). Users should be aware that \neven with the Follow-Up, a significant number of the children who screen positive on the M- CHAT -R will \nnot be diagnosed with ASD; however, these children are at high risk for other developmental disorders or \ndelays, and therefore, evaluation is warranted for any child who screens positive.  The M- CHAT -R can \nbe scored in less than two minutes. Scoring instructions can be downloaded from \nhttp://www.mchatscreen.com . Associated documents will be available for download as well.  \nScoring Algorithm \nFor all items except 2, 5, and 12, the response \u201cNO\u201d indicates ASD risk; for items 2, 5, and 12, \u201cYES\u201d \nindicates ASD risk. The following algorithm maximizes psychometric properties of the M- CHAT -R: \nLOW-RISK : Total Score is 0-2 ; if child is younger than 24 months, screen again after second \nbirthday. No further action required unless surveillance indicates risk for ASD.  \nMEDIUM-RISK : Total Score is 3-7 ; Administer the Follow-Up (second stage of M- CHAT -R/F) to get \nadditional information about at-risk responses. If M- CHAT -R/F score remains at 2 or \nhigher, the child has screened positive. Action required: refer child for diagnostic \nevaluation and eligibility evaluation for early intervention. If score on Follow-Up is 0-1, \nchild has screened negative. No further action required unless surveillance indicates risk \nfor ASD. Child should be rescreened at future well-child visits. \nHIGH-RISK :  Total Score is 8- 20; It is acceptable to bypass the Follow-Up and refer immediately for \ndiagnostic evaluation and eligibility evaluation for early intervention. \u00a92009 Diana Robins, Deborah Fein, & Marianne BartonM-CHAT -RTM\nPlease answer these questions about your child.

The M- CHAT -R/F may be downloade d from \nwww.mchatscreen.com . \nThe M- CHAT -R/F is a copyrighted instrument, and use of thi s instrument i s limited by the authors and \ncopyright holders. The M- CHAT -R and M- CHAT -R/F may be used for clinical, research, and educational \npurposes. Although we ar e making the tool availabl e free of charge for these uses, thi s is copyrighted \nmaterial and it is not open source. Anyone interested in using the M-C HAT-R/F in any commercial or \nelectronic products must contact Diana L. Robins at mchatscreen2009@gmail.com  to request \npermission.  \nInstructions for Use \nThe M-C HAT-R/F is designed to be used with the M-C HAT-R; the M-CHAT-R is valid for screening \ntoddlers between 16 and 30 months of age, to assess risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Users \nshould be aware that even with the Follow-Up, a significant number of the children who fail the M-C HAT-\nR will not be diagnosed with ASD; however, these children are at risk for other developmental disorders \nor delays, and therefore, follow-up is warranted for any child who screens positive.  \nOnce a parent has completed the M-C HAT-R, score the instrument according to the instructions. If the \nchild screens positive, select the Follow-Up items based on which items the child failed on the M-CHAT-\nR; only those items that were originally failed need to be administered for a complete interview.  \nEach page of the interview corresponds to one item from the M-C HAT-R. Follow the flowchart format, \nasking questions until a PASS or FAIL is scored. Please note that parents may report \u201cmaybe\u201d in \nresponse to questions during the interview. When a parent reports \u201cmaybe,\u201d ask whether most often the \nanswer is \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d and continue the interview according to that response. In places where there is \nroom to report an \u201cother\u201d response, the interviewer must use his/her judgment to determine whether it is \na passing response or not.  \nScore the responses to each item on the M-C HAT-R/F Scoring Sheet (which contains the same items as \nthe M-C HAT-R, but Yes/No has been replaced by Pass/Fail).

The \nareola has moved back to \nthe general shape of the breast.

Drawing E \n \n  \n  \n \nThere is no pubic hair at all There is a little soft, long, \nlightly colored hair. This \nhair may be straight or a little curly. The hair is darker in this \nstage. It is coarser and \nmore curled. It has spread out and thinly covers a larger area. The hair is now as dark, \ncurly, and coarse as that of \nan adult female. However, the area that the hair covers is not as large as that of an adult female. The hair has \nnot spread out to the thighs. The hair is now like that of \nan adult female. It also \ncovers the same area as that of an adult female.

The stress response is \nprimarily determined by our perception of an event, \ntransition, or problem.  Finding a balance in our lives and \nmanaging our stress can be a challenge.  An important \nfirst step is recognizing the degree to which we are \naffected by the stress in  our lives and then move toward \nstrategies to make it better.   \nThe following are series of self -assessment scales to help \nus determine the degree and type of stress we are \nexperiencing and how well our stress coping skills are \nworking.  \n \nDisclaimer:   Test scores on the following self -assessments do not reflect any partic ular diagnosis or course of \ntreatment.  They are me ant as a tool to help assess your level of stress.  Should you have any further c oncerns \nabout your current well -being, you may contact NYSUT  Social Services and ta lk confidentially to one of our \nsocial service specialists.  Symptoms of Stress   \n \nHow frequently do you find yourself experiencing such problems as headaches, problems going to sleep \nor staying asleep, unexplained muscle pain, jaw pain, uncontrolled anger, and frustration? Using the \ntable  below, assess the frequency that you experience these common symptoms  of stress.  \n \n Frequency of symptoms  \nSymptoms  Almost all \nday, every \nday Once or \ntwice daily  Every \nnight or \nday 2-3 times per \nweek  Once a \nweek  Once a \nmonth  Never  \nHeadaches         \nTense  \nmuscles, sore \nneck and back         \nFatigue         \nAnxiety, worry, \nphobias         \nDifficulty falling \nasleep         \nIrritability         \nInsomnia         \nBouts of \nanger/hostility         \nBoredom, \ndepression         \nEating too \nmuch or too \nlittle        \nDiarrhea, \ncramps, gas, \nconstipation         \nRestlessness, \nitching, tics         \n \nThe more often you experience these symptoms of stress, the more likely stress is having a negative \nimpact on your life. You may be so used to feeling a certain way that you a ssume this is normal. Look \nback over the Symptoms of Stress Table. Are there symptoms of stress that you would like to eliminate \nor change?   Perceived Stress Scale   \n \nA more precise measure of personal stress can be determined by using a variety of instrume nts that \nhave been designed to help measure individual stress levels. The first of these is called the Perceived \nStress Scale .  \nThe Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is  a classic stress assessment instrument. This tool, while originally \ndeveloped in 1983, rema ins a popular choice for helping us understand how different situations affect our \nfeelings and our perceived stress. The questions in this scale ask about your feelings and thoughts \nduring the last month. In each case, you will be asked to indicate how of ten you felt or thought a certain \nway. Although some of the questions are similar, there are differences between them and you should \ntreat each one as a separate question. The best approach is to answer fairly quickly. That is, don't try to \ncount up the nu mber of times you felt a particular way; rather indicate the alternative that seems like a \nreasonable estimate.  \nFor each question choose from the following alternatives:  \n0 \u2013 never         1 - almost never        2 \u2013 sometimes         3 - fairly often         4 - very often  \n____ 1. In the last month, how often have you been upset because of something that happened \nunexpectedly?  \n_____ 2. In the last month, how often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things \nin your life?  \n_____ 3. In the last month, how often have you felt nervous and stressed?  \n_____ 4. In the last month, how often have you felt confident about your ability to handle your    personal \nproblems?  \n_____ 5. In the last month, how often have you felt that things were going  your way?  \n_____ 6. In the last month, how often have you found that you could not cope with all the things that you \nhad to do?  \n_____ 7. In the last month, how often have you been able to control irritations in your life?  \n_____ 8. In the last month, how  often have you felt that you were on top of things?  \n_____ 9. In the last month, how often have you been angered because of things that happened that were \noutside of  your control?  \n_____ 10. In the last month, how often have you felt difficulties were pil ing up so high that you could not \novercome them?  \n \n  Figuring your PSS score:  \nYou can determine your PSS score by following these directions:  \nFirst, reverse your scores for questions 4, 5, 7, & 8. On these 4 questions, change the scores like this: 0 \n= 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1, 4 = 0.  \nNow add up your scores for each item to get a total. My total score is ______.   \nIndividual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived \nstress.  \nScores ranging from 0 -13 would be consi dered low stress.  \nScores ranging from 14 -26 would be considered moderate stress.  \nScores ranging from 27 -40 would be considered high perceived stress.  \nThe Perceived Stress Scale is interesting and important because your perception of what is happening in  \nyour life is most important. Consider the idea that 2 individuals could have the exact same events and \nexperiences in their lives for the past month. Depending on their perception,  total score could put one of \nthose individuals  in the low stress categor y and the total score could put the second person in the high \nstress category.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Ardell Wellness Stress Test   \nDon Ardell developed a stress assessment that is unique in its holistic approach to stress. In chapter \none, you learned about the impor tance of incorporating all dimensions of health in your understanding of \nstress. The Ardell Wellness Stress Test incorporates physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and social \naspects of health for a balanced assessment.   \nRate your satisfaction with each of the following items by using this scale:   \n+ 3 = Ecstatic      -1 = Mildly disappointed   \n+ 2 = Very happy     - 2 = Very disappointed   \n+ 1 = Mildly happy     - 3 = Completely dismayed   \n   0 = Indifferent   \n_____ 1.
