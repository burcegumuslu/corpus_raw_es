For each stage, I\nwill focus on the changing U.S. influences, signals or designs around Andean cocaand cocaine, the global contexts and competing cocaine circuits which mediated\nthose transnational forces and flows, and the notably dynamic Peruvian responses\nto North-American drug challenges.  Each period left its legacies, and paradoxes,for cocaine\u2019s progressive definition as a global, illicit and menacing drug.\n                                                          \n1 I thank the Wilson Center, and its Latin American Program in particular, for their hospitality\nand largesse this year; Julio Cotler (Instituto de Estudios Peruanos, Lima) for his commentary;Kathy Morse for assistance; colleagues, friends and helpers in the larger research project thisessay represents; and our new son, Danyal Natan, for allowing the sleep needed to put ittogether.\n2 And largely unknown: this essay is of a larger archival project to unveil this hidden history. For\nthe U.S. itself, we now have the superb study by Joseph F. Spillane, Cocaine: From Medical\nMarvel to Modern Menace in the United States, 1884-1920  (Baltimore: John Hopkins University\nPress, 1999); for global views, Paul Gootenberg, ed., Cocaine: Global Histories (London:\nRoutledge UK, 1999); as background, Steven B. Karch,  MD, A Brief History of Cocaine (Boca\nRaton: CRC Press, 1998). A reliable source on transnational issues is William Walker III, Drug\nControl in the Americas  (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1981)2      This is mainly a synthetic essay\u2013trying to make sense of a vast body of new\nresearch in the archives\u2013but the history of drugs also makes fertile ground for\ntrying new methods or approaches from the historical social sciences.   Twoapproaches are worth mentioning here.  First, this essay draws on the \u201cnew\ninternational history,\u201d which is working to overcome traditional academic\ndichotomies between \u201cdomestic\u201d and \u201cforeign\u201d actors, dominant and dependentgeographies of power, and between cultural and economic dimensions oftransnational events and relationships.  I hope to go behind and beyond standard\ndiplomatic history narratives of  \u201cdrug control.\u201d  Secondly, this essay shares\nbroadly in what can be termed a political or social \u201cconstructionist\u201d view of drugregimes, an approach with long roots in \u201cdrug studies.\u201d  Not only official drug\npolicies, but our basic attitudes towards drugs (friend or foe, legal or illicit,\ndomesticated or foreign), their variable social uses and effects, and even shiftingpatterns of supply and demand, are to a great degree historically created,\nconditioned and changeable.  Drug history, including cocaine\u2019s, best focuses on\nour protean social relationships to mind-altering substances, than say the rigiddictates of drug chemistry or current morality.\n3\n                                                          \n3 For a feel for this new international history, try some recent anthologies: Gilbert Joseph, C.\nLeGrand, R.

Stoler, eds., Tensions of Empire: Colonial Cultures in a Bourgeois\nWorld (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997).  For a longer analysis of3      The three phases explored in this cocaine genealogy are 1) 1885-1910: the\npromotion of inter-American coca and cocaine networks (an initial period when the\nU.S. and Peru actively worked together to make cocaine into a modern medical andglobal commodity).   2) 1910-1940:  an era of transition when the U.S. reversed\nitself and launched a domestic and worldly crusade to banish the drug (while Peru\nexhibited greater autonomy, ambivalence and cultural crisis towards its nationalcoca and cocaine).    3) 1940-1980:  when contemporary cocaine \u201cprohibitions\u201dcame to fruition and with a global reach, accompanied by a high degree of U.S.-\nPeruvian collaboration.  But this final period and process also witnessed the birth\nof illicit international networks of the drug, and with them, as we also see, thepersisting and paradox-laden North-American drug dilemmas of the late twentieth\ncentury.\n1860\u20131910: From Coca to Commodity Cocaine\n     Cocaine, crystallized from Peruvian coca leaf by1860, was widely regarded as a\nmodern \u201cmiracle\u201d alkaloid of the late nineteenth century.  By 1900, the UnitedStates had emerged as the world\u2019s largest consumer and booster of both these\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\u201cconstructionism\u201d and Drug studies, see P.

This view\u2019s many sources range from anthropology\n(classical ethno-botany) to the behavioral drug \u201cset and setting\u201d school of Norman Zinberg, totoday\u2019s post-structuralism. A corrective to un-reconstructed constructionism is philosopher IanHacking\u2019s The Social Construction of What?

Coca leaf\nspread first inspired by luxuriant French wine tonics and a growing public and\nscientific confidence in coca\u2019s active qualities.  During the 1860s, leadingAmerican physicians, such as William S. Searle, traded notes and fresh coca with\ntheir Peruvian counterparts.  Erythroxylon coca , a mild and complex stimulant\ncomparable to tea or coffee, was embraced therapeutically by a range of American\u201ceclectic\u201d and herbal medicine men and drug companies, for a broad range ofailments, real and imagined. Culturally, coca became the antidote for that most\nemblematic of Gilded-Age American conditions--\u201cneurasthenia\u201d\u2013the chronic\nnervousness associated with fast-paced urbanity and competitive modernity.Infused in countless tonics and \u201cpatent medicines\u201d of the era, North America\u2019s\nlove affair with coca became immortalized in \u201c Coca-Cola,\u201d concocted in Atlanta\nin 1886, and by 1900 was already one of the most successful and exportablecommodities ever marketed.\n4  By 1900, the U.S. imported 600-1,000 (metric) tons\nof coca annually, mainly for this consumer market, and mainly from Peru. One still\nfeels the initial American enchantment with coca in Dr. W. Golden Mortimer\u2019sclassic defense of it, History of Coca: \u201cThe Divine Plant\u201d of the Incas  (1901).\n                                                          \n4Mark Pendergrast, For God, Country and Coca-Cola  (N.Y: Scribner, 1993), ch. 2, for American\nculture of coca; W.

Its medical uses, especially in\nsurgery, boomed after the late 1884 news of its local anesthetic powers. Cocainerevolutionized anesthesia and hitherto unbearably delicate operations, such as eye\nsurgery.  By the late 1880s, scores of American physicians and pharmacists,\nfollowing European leads, experimented with cocaine and publicized its otherpotential applications, in forums ranging from Detroit\u2019s commercial Therapeutic\nGazette to the staid New York Academy of Medicine. For a while, cocaine sparked\nserious debates as a therapy for a host of internal bodily and mental ills: for\ncholera, opiate addiction, hay fever, epilepsy, melancholia and so on.  LeadingU.S. pharmaceuticals firms\u2013Parke, Davis & Co., Schlieffelin & Co., Mallinckrodt\nChemical Works, Merck of New Jersey\u2013swiftly became leaders in cocaine\nproduction, marketing 5 to 6 tons of it yearly by the turn of the century, about athird of world supply.  Cocaine\u2013purer, more powerful, and more \u201cscientific\u201d than\ncoca\u2013was lauded by some of the greatest figures in American medicine, such as\nWilliam Hammond and William S. Halstead. But doctors also developed abalanced appreciation of the drug\u2019s dangerous side effects, and by the 1890s,\nwarnings and fears of another type of use, by thrill-seeking \u201ccocaine fiends,\u201d who\nearly discovered the recreational uses of cocaine (by injection or snorting).\n5\n                                                          \n5 Spillane, Cocaine, ch. 6, studies the making of the \u201cfiend.\u201d Medical journals of the late 1880s6     The United States, through a variety of signals and means, sought to encourage\nPeruvian production of coca (though less so, of manufactured cocaine).  In the\nmid-1880s, the heated interest of North American science and industry quicklyfiltered to Peruvians, doctors, statesmen and capitalists. The U.S. Navy and U.S.\nConsuls in the Andes worked to ensure coca supply routes during the great coca\nscarcity and price crisis of 1884-87; later, Commercial Attach\u00e9s in Lima builtcontacts with local cocaine-makers to diversify their business and helped Peruviansto upgrade coca processing and shipping practices. One U.S. Consul in the region\nworked to promote coca use up north to Americans (or whom he termed \u201cWhite\nPeople\u201d) as a healthy substitute for their favorite vice, whisky.  In the mid-1880s,Parke, Davis & Co. sent Henry Hurd Rusby, North America\u2019s premier\n\u201cpharmocognosist\u201d (i.e., ethno-botanist) on a legendary Andean mission to scope\nout secure supplies and for study of indigenous coca therapies, the first of Rusby\u2019smany involvements with the drug.  Drug-trade journals debated coca-growing\nschemes closer to or even within the U.S., though this talk abated as Peru proved\namply capable of meeting swelling American demands.\n6  (Anecdotally, even the\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n(e.g., New York Medical Journal, 1884-1890, esp. The New York Academy of Medicine, 26th\nNov 1889, \u201cThe Indiscriminate Use of Cocaine\u201d a symposium)  had already noted  cocaine\u2019s\npotential perils as well as non-medical use.\n6H.H.

In fact, little\npush was needed here, as after 1898 South America drifted into the informal\nexpanding U.S. commercial sphere.  Indeed by the mid-1890s, a clutch of U.S.cocaine interests, flexing political muscle, overtly discriminated against the nascent\nPeruvian cocaine industry, by getting U.S. tariffs to strongly favor domestic\nmanufacturers of the drug, and their coveted coca-leaf inputs and imports overrefined drugs.     The U.S., however, was by no means the sole power vested in cocaine. It\ncompeted with a vibrant early science and \u201ccommodity chain\u201d linking Germanic-\nEurope to the Andes. Austro-Swiss-Germans traversed the Andes in mid-centuryand revived a long dormant European interest in coca, now for an industrializing\nworld.\n7 German pharmacologists ordered fresh Peruvian coca supplies during the\nAustrian Novara naval mission of 1859, for their leading-edge laboratories, where\nAlbert Niemann (among others) soon claimed credit for \u201cdiscovering\u201d its most\nactive of alkaloids, Kokain.

It was a German\nfirm, E. Merck of Darmstadt, which earned its name making premium cocaine\nhydrochloride, its leading product-line by the 1890s. Hamburg became the world\u2019scocaine-mart, and by 1900 German pharmaceuticals joined into a formidable\n\u201ccartel\u201d to manage unstable world cocaine prices and profits.\n8  (The French, \u00e1 la\npopular coca-laced Vin Mariani , and the British with imperial Kew Gardens, also\nworked some influences, yet theirs more focused on neo-Incan coca cultures and\ncoca-leaf botany, used from opera singers to bicycle racers).  The Germanic-link\nreached far into Peru.  Lima\u2019s best-placed cocaine merchants and manufacturing\npharmacies sported German names.  It was a German national off to Peru, oneArnaldo Kitz, who marched out in 1888 to find Austrian peasants (in the lost\nAmazonian colony of Pozuzo) and created a new cocaine industry \u201con the spot\u201d--\nthe eastern Andes, ancestral homeland of coca.  Moreover, Europeans took anactive colonial-mercantilist stake in coca.  The British in India, as well as the\nFrench and Dutch, swiftly launched botanical and commercial experiments for\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nanthropological transnational approach linking power and cultures, try Sidney Mintz\u2019s Sweetness\nand Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History  (New York: Viking Penguin, 1985).\n8 Cocaine was a multiple discovery\u2013others being Gaedcke and an obscure Italian pharmacist\n(Pizzi) in La Paz.

The German\ncocaine nexus survived into this century.  Hamburg brought in the bulk of legalPeruvian cocaine for refinement (whereas New York imported coca), and\nAmerican policy pegged Germany as the chief obstacle to global cocaine controls,\nduring the first international Narcotics Conventions (1912) and beyond.      Peruvian responses to these worldly forces proved crucial to the making ofmodern cocaine as a global commodity. In the late nineteenth century, Peru was a\npoor, ethnically fractured and economically devastated land, barely recovering\nfrom the multiple disasters of its first six decades of independent life. The cocabush was long tinged with traditional leaf  \u201cchewing\u201d by the country\u2019s Andean\nIndian majority, a custom ambivalently viewed by the country\u2019s white coastal elite.\nBy the 1860s, Peruvian intellectuals and medical-men, such as M.A. Fuentes, J.C.Ulloa and Dr. Tom\u00e1s Moreno y Ma\u00edz, began to actively re-valorize native coca,\nnow as a good thing and sleeping fortune, sparked by growing European medical\ncuriosity. In the mid-1880s, after the catastrophic War of the Pacific with Chile, alocal medical and promotional movement for cocaine swiftly coalesced in concert\nwith overseas scientific and burgeoning commercial interest. The innovative\nchemical and therapeutic researches of Lima pharmacist Alfredo Bignon\u2013a truecase of scientific \u201cexcellence on the periphery\u201d\u2013brought forth by 1885 a medical10and promotional \u201cCocaine Commission\u201d and commercial emulators  (a handful of\nexporting cocaine workshops in the capital.)   This caught the full attention of the\nPeruvian authorities, which convened a blue-ribbon panel on the drug.  The laterUlloa \u201cCoca Commission\u201d of 1888 strongly urged Peruvian production of the drug\nitself for export, \u201ccrude cocaine,\u201d not just coca, coca elixirs and the like. They\nurged a range of pro-active steps to disseminate coca\u2019s uses and popularity abroad;to make coca a mass \u201chygienic\u201d (health) good of the northern toiling masses.Peruvian coca would be the \u201ccoffee or tea\u201d of the coming century. The country\u2019s\nintellectual lights, such as sociologist Carlos Liss\u00f3n, also weighed in for\nmodernizing cocaine, as did pioneer promoters of Amazonian development.\n9  The\nactivities were well underway.\n      Peru became the biggest supplier of this cocaine, along with coca, to this novel\nworld market of the 1890s, until its saturation by around 1905. Cocainemanufacturing, based on Bignon\u2019s methods, spread from Lima to all parts of the\ncountry where coca thrived: northern La Libertad Department, Amazonian Pozuzo,\nthe tropics of southern Cuzco and Huanta, and central Andes Hu\u00e1nuco.  By 1900,\n                                                          \n9For Bignon and local cocaine science, P.

A government colonization program spurred a small wave of coca\npeasant migration to the valley (and frontier Monz\u00f3n), largely augmenting the\nlabor and influence of existing estates. By 1900, the peak of the trade, cocaproducts reached fifth-place among Peru\u2019s export earners: some two millionpounds of coca (mostly sent to Americans) and more than ten metric tons of\ncocaine (mainly to Germany).\n10  \u201cHu\u00e1nuco\u201d and northern \u201cTrujillo\u201d leaf became\nbranded commodities on world medicinal markets, edging out Bolivian and Cuzcovarieties that fell back onto traditional local markets.  Immigrant entrepreneurs--\nFrench, Germans and in Hu\u00e1nuco, a circle of Croats--helped initiate cocaine\nprocessing in Peru, worked up in about two dozen small factories, employing localtooling and techniques. The impure export product\u2013cocaine sulfates or crude\ncocaine\u2013was akin to the illicit jungle \u201cpasta b\u00e1sica\u201d of the 1980s, but sent on for\nrefinement and medical markets by legal pharmaceutical firms in the core, ratherthan to clandestine labs and smugglers in Colombia.

The northern\nTrujillo circuit increasingly specialized in coca-leaf sales for the U.S., eventuallybecoming (via Maywood Chemical Co. of New Jersey) the privileged supplier for\nCoca-Cola --albeit as a de- cocainized coca beverage after 1903.  Hu\u00e1nuco\u2019s\ncocaine industry, in particular, became the bastion of an expansive regional poleand politics, articulating the tropical slopes of Huallaga\u2019s Amazon to drug markets,drug firms and soon, to \u201csnow\u201d aficionados and anti-narcotics reformers across the\nglobe.\n     High hopes got invested in Peruvian cocaine (no pun intended).  Cocaine, in thewords of statesman Alejandro Garland, was the \u201cessentially Peruvian industry.\u201d\nCocaine became so highly valorized because it fused \u201cmodern\u201d Western science\nand liberal commerce with a dormant ancient national resource, Peruvian coca leaf.Coca signified the wondrous gifts Peru could offer the world, and even its native\nstock went up with its new Europeanized uses (hadn\u2019t Andean peoples first\ndiscovered it?). Cocaine embodied deferred nationalist hopes of industrialism.\n11  It\ncombined a \u201cnatural\u201d world monopoly with proof of what innovative Peruvians\ncould do, without recourse to old-style central government intervention.  In part,\n                                                          \n11Paul Gootenberg, Imagining Development: Economic Ideas in Peru\u2019s \u2018Fictitious Prosperity\u2019 of\nGuano (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993); this notion developed also in JoAnn\nKawell, \u201cThe Essentially Peruvian Industry,\u201d unpublished Ms., Berkeley, 1997.13such positive and Positivist associations reflected how cocaine\u2013by 1900 a waning\nnineteenth-century miracle drug\u2013was seen in the world at large, with a strong dose\nof national pride.       So, when between 1900 and 1920 cocaine began its transformation in the outer\nworld\u2013from miracle to pariah drug, from boom commodity to an un-welcomed\nillicit one\u2013its legacies were paradoxical ones. The principle legacy was theworking existence of these global circuits of commodity cocaine: the U.S.-Andeanand the distinctive European link, which now had to be limited or suppressed. The\nAmerican preference for coca leaf\u2013magnified through the lens of tariffs\u2013was\npreferably acquired through informal currents of commerce with Peru. Cocaineearned its place as the \u201cfirst modern global drug,\u201d not only in its far geographic\nreach but also in its broad cultural implications.\n12  In one generation, it became\ninverted in Western medical circles, from a possible modern panacea to anunscientific \u201cmania,\u201d and from the hope of exhausted modern \u201cbrain-workers\u201d to\nthe bane of our criminal classes, \u201ceasy women\u201d (i.e., sex-workers), despised racial\nminorities and catchword \u201cOthers.\u201d One paradox in this complex transformationwas that coca\u2013a relatively benign object of widespread popular use, and a possible\n                                                          \n12 P. Gootenberg, \u201cCocaine: The Hidden Histories,\u201d ch.1 of Gootenberg, Cocaine: Global\nHistories (1999) as \u201cglobal\u201d drug.

Another\nirony lay in how the U.S., the most avid consumer of both substances, quicklytransformed into the world\u2019s most passionate and committed anti-cocaine crusader,\nin what medical historian David F. Musto has diagnosed generally as \u201cthe\nAmerican Disease\u201d\u2013our eternal love-hate obsession with drugs as remedy andscourge.\n13   For Peru, these were highly confused messages: once so vital to\ndevelop, cocaine was now deemed a bad thing.  It took many years for Peruvians to\nfully get that message, perhaps due to the high initial hopes placed on the drug, as\nwell as the material and regional interests at stake.\nCocaine in Decline, 1910-1940\n     Cocaine did decline globally in the years 1910 to 1940, both in worldly prestige\nand bodily use. World consumption likely halved from a fifteen-ton yearly peak to\nless than four million tons in shrinking \u201clegitimate\u201d medical uses by the eve of\nWorld War II.  This period saw the first attempts, led by the U.S., to project aglobal prohibition region around cocaine, and the continuance (and better put\n                                                          \n13David Musto, The American Disease : Origins of Narcotic Control  (New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1973); \u201cAmerica\u2019s First Cocaine Epidemic,\u201d Wilson Quarterly (Summer 1989);\nanother cyclical view is David T. Courtright, \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Cocaine in the UnitedStates,\u201d in J. Goodman, P. Lovejoy, and A.

But this era was, significantly,\nalso the low-point of illicit or recreational (ab)use of cocaine.\n     The United States was the prime mover in most of cocaine\u2019s changes\u2013asEuropeans, Peruvians and other emerging actors watched, waited or eluded them.\nThe sources of American anti-cocainism were complex, and will never be\nnarrowed to one over-riding cause. It first welled up from local levels\u2013by 1905most American states had passed specific \u201canti-cocaine\u201d statutes in reaction toclearer dangers, real and imagined, of the drug, and an underground space,\ndispersed market and deviant culture of pleasure-seeking non-medical cocaine\npreceded the legal bans. The highly visible and feared figure of the \u201ccoke fiend\u201dpredated drug prohibitions and he appeared more menacing than behaviorally\npassive and still often upper-class opiate habitu\u00e9s. By 1905, cocaine use also\nbecame notoriously racialized: across the new Jim-Crow south as rampaging\u201cNegroes\u201d on coke, in northern cities, New York especially, as unscrupulous and\npredatory pharmacists and dealers, or \u201cJew-peddlers\u201d everywhere. This was an\neffective mixture of  \u201cmoral panic\u201d\u2013i.e. a classic passionate drug scare\u2013and seriousmuckraking concerns. The reduced club of U.S. manufacturers joined the\ncampaign, led by professionalizing pharmacy and (mainstream) organized medical\ninterests like the A.M.A.\u2013in good part, to narrow or monopolize the field ofprofessional use and to repair damaged public trust and reputations. Cocaine, U.S.16historian Joe Spillane now shows, had become a glaring symbol of unregulated\ndrugs and unreformed drug companies.14  Cocaine also got caught up with, and\nsometimes conflated or lost in, surging Progressive-era campaigns againstNarcotics (with their new medicalized \u201caddiction\u201d model of abuse) and alcohol\n(that oldest of American demons).  Starting in 1906, the pure FDA acts scrutinized,\nregulated and exposed coca \u201cpatent\u201d-medicine frauds, and a few cocaineconcoctions catering specifically to fiends.  Its crusade climaxed in a failed 1911-12 Chattanooga show trial of Coca-Cola  itself, with H.H. Rusby now a prime\ngovernment witness against the drug.  In 1914, responding to international treaty\nimperatives of our own making, Congress unanimously added cocaine to theHarrison Narcotic Act (the first federal law); in 1922, coca imports fell under strict\ncontrol in the Jones-Miller Act, which banned all cocaine imports. The vigilance of\nU.S. Treasury agents, State Department officials and later Harry J. Anslinger\u2019slegendary Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) came into action.\n     Subsequently, after peaking around 1917, cocaine consumption fell off\ndramatically in the U.S. (and elsewhere) during the inter-war period, in what one\n                                                          \n14 Spillane,  Cocaine, chs. 2, 5, 7 ; Pendergrast,  God and Coca-Cola, , ch. 7; Musto has\nemphasized the race factor; less so Lester Grinspoon and James Bakalar, Cocaine: A Drug and\nits Social Evolution  (New York: Basic Books, 1977), ch. 2.

Cocaine medicinal usage continued to shrink, assubstitutes like eucaine and procaine came on line, and cocaine research dried up\nsince it poorly fit the new medical or opiate addiction paradigm. Most importantly,\nalmost no organized international network of illicit cocaine emerged afterprohibition laws, comparable to that coalescing around a younger ex-miracle drug,heroin. Even critically eyed, the inescapable conclusion from scrutiny of the era\u2019s\npublic health and FBN reports is: fewer and fewer cocaine fiends, and by the\n1930s, effectively no cocaine being smuggled from abroad (with confiscationsmeasured in ounces or vials of diverted European medical grade). No illicit\nfactories came into being and no illegal trades sprouted from Andean coca fields.\n15\nIn part, this pattern reflected our narrow \u201cpolitical economy\u201d of cocaine production\nand control: four, then only two New Jersey firms, Merck and Maywood, who only\nimported bulky and easily-tracked coca to their sheltered and minutely-regulated\nmarket. They energetically cooperated with U.S. drug officials, who in turnpromoted their name and causes over the next decades.  For cocaine, U.S. borders\n                                                          \n15H. Wayne Morgan, Yesterday\u2019s Addicts  (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1974).\nEurope was a slightly different story, with cocaine \u201csub-cultures\u201d thriving through the 1920s inWeimer Berlin, London\u2019s West End, the sin port of Rotterdam and the famous Montemarte(prostitution) district of Paris. Here, \u201ccoke\u201d or \u201csnow\u201d was diverted from pharmacies and legaldrug firms.

Other nations were frankly un-panicked or agnostic aboutcocaine, while American incentives to push them stayed low, given their lack of\ncredible domestic cocaine threat by 1920.  In the teens, U.S. diplomats like\nHamilton Wright, acting almost unilaterally, had anti-cocaine clauses first writteninto the 1912-13 Hague Convention. Even as a passive non-member, the U.S. and\nAmerican critics placed cocaine issues onto the agenda of the League-of-Nations\u2019\nGeneva drug conventions of the 1920s and 1930s, which, for example, convened ashort-lived \u201cCoca Committee\u201d of 1934.

The great 1960s folk-singer Dave VanRonk covered the1920s ditty \u201cCocaine\u201d (pre-Clapton) with a ragged ensemble dubbed the\u201cHudson Dusters\u201d(NY: Verve-Forecast Records, 1968): a layered case of cultural memory, as19for drug controls, assumed the universalist stand that all abusable manufactured\ndrugs needed a global fix, which meant stemming raw-materials supply, which the\nU.S. conveniently had no colonial stakes in. Big power politics also played a role.Britain seconded this position, in part from concerns about cocaine scares in China\nand its Indian colonies (an unknown episode), but in part to stymie stronger opiates\nresolutions, knowing that Germany (the world\u2019s largest cocaine and morphineinterest) would veto any encompassing controls. But the Germans, for a variety ofreasons, went along with the idea instead.\n17  The contradictory results, visible in\ncountless League of Nations reports and resolutions from the 1920s on, were\nfictional big-power designs on cocaine\u2013spotty statistics mandated and published,abbreviated on-off discussions, American pleas for real action.

Weak and focused on opiates, however, the League did\nhelp de-legitimize cocaine in global ideological arenas, defined shrinking\nmedicinal quotas, and inadvertently, sparked a shadow cocaine network\u2013this timein Southeast Asia.\n     North American anti-cocainism  filtered through a more diffuse cocaine world\nbetween 1910 and 1940. Two novel global cocaine chains burst onto the scene: theDutch-Javan colonial link (for Europe through the 1920s) and later, a Japanesepan-Asian network (in the shadows of fictive League controls).  Both mercantilist\ncircuits took Peruvian producers, who thought coca their birthright, wholly by\nsurprise, and for a two-decade interlude, 1920-1940, bypassed the Andes as worldcocaine centers.\n      The Netherlands first experimented with coca in Java in the mid-1880s, but like\nothers these colonial efforts went dormant. Yet suddenly after 1905, officiallyencouraged, the island sprouted dozens of modern hyper-productive coca\nplantations, and by 1912 more than 1,000 tons of Javan high-alkaloid leaf a year\neffectively wiped Andean coca from European ports. Amsterdam\u2019s central state-sponsored \u201cNCF\u201d cocaine works (the Nederlandsche Cocainefabriek , which\nformed as German patents ran out on advanced cocaine-extraction methods)\nbecame the world\u2019s dominant producer of the drug.  After World War I, and atelling crisis of over-production, the NCF became a leg of now League-sanctioned21European cocaine supply and pricing syndicates. Yet, with poor prospects, and the\npioneering Dutch commitment to ideals of international institutional cooperation\n(as in The Hague), the Netherlands voluntarily dismantled their cocaine empire in\nthe late 1920s.  Java still raised coca in the 1930s\u2013even Merck N.J., wary of\nPeruvian leaf quality, invested in its own plantation there.18\n      As the Dutch role faded, the imperial sun of industrializing Japan took off\u2013this\ntime, in an Asian response to League and American norms. Japan planted its firstcolonial coca on Taiwan in 1916 and by the late 1920s, with leading national\nchemists like Jokichi Takamine at the helm, was making upwards of three tons of\ncocaine a year\u2013i.e., half of official world medicinal needs. In 1917, in a fascinatingjump across global commodity chains, Hoshi Pharmaceuticals purchased a massive\ntract in Peru\u2019s Huallaga valley, near Tingo Mar\u00eda, where it found raw material, and\nperhaps know-how, until they got expropriated in 1937.  Some of Japan\u2019s largestdrug firms, exploiting military ties, forged this cocaine (and even weightier heroin)\nnetwork, which peaked during the 1930s, supported by faked official drug statistics\nand retail markets across Asia, some involving evidently shadowy or coerced\n                                                          \n18 Marcel De Kort, \u201cDoctors, Diplomats, and Businessmen: Conflicting Interests in the\nNetherlands and Dutch East Indies, 1860-1950,\u201d ch. 5, in Gootenberg, Cocaine: Global Histories\n(1999); for a Peruvian optic on Java, M.E.

In this larger context, the American relation to Peruvian cocaine was changing.\nYet, one falsely assumes that the U.S. easily or successfully \u201cexported\u201d a new drug\npolicy upon Peru, which continued to make its quite legal cocaine and stoodoutside the new global drug regime (Peru also had dropped out of the League andrarely or barely acknowledged its anti-drug conventions). American diplomats\nexpressed dismay at Peru\u2019s willful neglect of Hague principles in 1912-14 and\nremained wary of Peruvian motives (\u201cinterests\u201d) throughout the inter-war period.But rather than regard Peruvian cocaine as an imminent threat, these officials, soon\njoined by scrutinizing FBN agents, tried to learn more about it, or exchanged\ninformation (drug-control law or drug science) with their Peruvian counterparts. In1931, Lima\u2019s chief U.S. Consul mounted a detailed inspection tour of the Hu\u00e1nuco\ncocaine industry, and by the 1930s Washington likely had developed better drug\nsurveillance in Peru\u2013periodic \u201cReports on Coca,\u201d interviews, news clippings--than\n                                                          \n19 Steven B.

That was\none reason for lack of diplomatic pressure to limit or suppress coca.  So sometimes\nsuch interests got tangled, but the U.S. was not yet a heavy meddler.     Where did this all leave Peru?  Peruvian cocaine fell into an irreparable crisisfrom1910 to 1940. This crisis expressed itself in many forms; some influenced\nfrom abroad but others of a decidedly national ilk. The legal cocaine network\nremained both depressed and an increasingly regional rather than national interest.Hu\u00e1nuco\u2019s best industry reduced to a handful of operating or part-time workshops,\nand averaged less than a half-ton of yearly crude exports\u2013some 5% of its peak in\n1900, mainly to Germany, Britain and for a time Japan. Coca leaf, largely ofTrujillo origin, had to vie with competing non-Peruvian brands, even in the U.S.\nmarketplace.

Others briefly entered the field on the\nWorld War I price spike and the coming of the Second (as war drives up cocainestocks), but everyone in Hu\u00e1nuco sensed the dim prospects ahead.\n21  Yet,\ncontraband in Peruvian cocaine was not even rumor-worthy; a poorer cocaine\nindustry remained legitimate, in both senses of the term.      Besides fewer buyers, the rising international regime affected Peru in variedways. The Western world\u2019s rising anti-Narcotics ideals were quickly heard about,\nand some of a \u201chygienic\u201d nature adopted to fit local needs (moves against  Chinese\nopium dens; Narcotics health codes in 1922; a regulatory structure for the cocaineindustry, under Health Ministry auspices of the 1930s).  Just as pro-cocaine science\nhad before, modern anti-cocainism arrived in Peru mainly via medical and now\naddiction \u201cscience\u201d\u2013and curiously or not, focused on Indian coca chewing (for thetrue good of the natives, of course).

Modern cocaine (ab)use per se was not a\nproblem\u2013few Peruvians had ever touched it.\n      In fact, cocaine continued to be seen as a good thing, evoking serious calls todefend it.  In the teens and twenties, varied reformers vaunted the need to\nmodernize the crisis-ridden cocaine sector: scientific agriculture for improved coca\ncrops, and upgraded refining into a modern chemical industry, to produce puremedicinal cocaine-hydrochlorides for profitable final markets. A new theme\nsurfaced of needed state support\u2013after all, this was still a quintessential Peruvian\nproduct\u2013despite its world competitors and critics.  One remarkable public healthfigure, Dr. Carlos Enrique Paz Sold\u00e1n, combined all of these themes into a loud\n                                                          \n22Joseph Gagliano, Coca Prohibition in Peru: The Historical Debates (Tucson: University of\nArizona Press, 1994) , esp. ch 6 (and orig. texts, Valdiz\u00e1n to Saenz); S.

In a dramatic reversal of American \u201csupply-side\u201d anti-drug logic, Paz\nSold\u00e1n argued that strictures on cocaine in the West had actually forced Peru\u2019sexcess coca into the nervous systems of Peruvian Indians. As an alternative to\ndiscriminatory League quota controls, he proposed a giant Peruvian state\n\u201cMonopoly\u201d to regulate, promote and modernize cocaine, one that would deployits trading profits to wean suffering Indians from their coca-chewing pathology.\n23\nThis corporatist project sparked underground international maneuvers and\nmobilized national defenses of coca growers, as might befit the 1930s Depression.\nIn this contested climate, American sway on Peruvian drug policy remained slight.     Overall, many legacies and paradoxes emerged from this transitional period,\n1910-1940. The biggest and lasting change was the American transformation from\na world coca promoter to a would-be global crusader against cocaine. Yet, for acountry that vaunted from the start supply or externally based anti-drug strategies,\nthe U.S. achieved greatest success in drying up cocaine use within its borders. On\nthe outside, anti-cocaine ideas were spreading (mainly as a conflated lesser kin of\n                                                          \n23 On debate, P.

Paradoxically, these paper international sanctions\ncoincided with the swift diversification of world cocaine networks to Java andJapan\u2013though, such supply \u201cballooning\u201d now seems the norm of drug repression.\nIn Peru, the legacy was a growing schizophrenia between backward vile coca and\ndiscriminated modern cocaine, between nationalist alternatives and Americandesigns, between regional hopes and the slim economic reality of legal cocaine,between mounting U.S. influences and Peru\u2019s agnostic stance on dangerous drugs.\nSomething had to give. But the largest global puzzle was this: the era that saw the\ngreatest plurality of cocaine regimes and mentalities\u2013including tolerated legalcocaine industries abroad--was actually the best for the U.S. in terms of cocaine as\na volatile social problem.\nGlobal Prohibition to Illicit Cocaine (1940-1970s)\n     The paradox\u2013or not\u2013of the following period, from the 1940s to the early 1970s\nstart of our contemporary entanglement with Andean cocaine, is that the UnitedStates swiftly achieved its long-sought goal, a global cocaine-prohibitions regime,\nwith near universal scope and consensus. Yet what followed was the most\ncatastrophic American encounter ever with cocaine: the 1970s to 1980s illicit\n\u201ccoke\u201d boom (through its Yuppie to Crack phases) and our Sisyphusian cycle of28hemispheric \u201cdrug wars\u201d ever since. The causal links and chains here are surely\nentangled and have much to do with the defining of cocaine\u2019s new illicit sphere\nover a transnational space.     In the long saga of American drugs, World War II marks a turning point.\nDomestically, drug consumption of all kinds (save amphetamine) fell to record\nlows, given disruptions of traditional supply bases, strict border surveillance andthe era\u2019s tremendous social cohesion. In short, 1945 was a clean slate for drugs: a\u201cparadise\u201d for law enforcement (Anslinger\u2019s influence then at its peak) and a\npersonal hell for individuals out to find drugs or new drug cultures.\n24  That was to\nchange in the 1950s as heroin and other subcultures slowly took root in Americaninner cities, as prescription tranquilizers conquered the new white suburbs, as\n\u201cLSD\u201d escaped from secret CIA labs, and as (Italian) Mafia-like supply routes\nsprang up around opiates, sparking more punitive and aggressive Congressional-FBN drug laws (all with a modicum of memorable legal dissent).  This edifice\nwould implode in the mid-1960s, when the so-called \u201cdrug culture\u201d\u2013a dramatic\nand novel revival of the \u201cAmerican disease\u201d--brought these repressive norms intocultural relief and conflict.\n                                                          \n24Jill Jonnes, Hep-Cats, Narcs and Pipe-Dreams: A History of America\u2019s Romance with Illegal\nDrugs (Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 1997), pt II (not as \u201chep\u201d a book as title\nsuggests); for insight into desperate drug culture of era, see William S.

Smith, A Social History of the Minor Tranquilizers  (New York:\nPharmaceutical Products Press, 1991 (orig. 1985).29     In terms of American foreign drug policy, the post-war decades were also\nparadise found. This time around, the U.S. became the unchallenged guiding hand\nof a refurbished UN global drug regime of the late 1940s, now based in New York.The CND (Council on Narcotic Drugs) and related bodies, unlike the League\u2019s\nformer Opium Commissions, went well beyond big powers, taking pains to\nintegrate rising \u201cthird-world\u201d nations (like coca-producing Peru) into its American-inspired maximalist agenda. Raw materials limitation became the cornerstone, nowaggressively pursued.  Our mortal ideological foe\u2013the Soviets and allies\u2013took an\neven harder Leninist line against mind-altering drugs, Anslinger\u2019s opportunistic\nmisinformation to the contrary. So during the Cold War, the dream of a unified,comprehensive and universally compulsory drug regime was slowly hammered out\nby Washington, culminating in the still-regnant UN \u201cSingle Convention\u201d of 1961.\n    Cocaine was still a sideshow: in fact in the U.S., old memories of popular cocawere gone (so buried that Coca-Cola could officially deny its use ever), and\n\u201csnow\u201d (or its dearth) a nostalgic lament of ancient bluesmen. One brief domestic\ncoke \u201cscare\u201d in 1949 deftly became another victory nail in the drug\u2019s coffin.Musto suggests this hiatus proved ultimately harmful, as Americans retained no\ncollective cultural memory of cocaine, or its perils, when it reappeared around301970 as a prestigious and pricey sin.25  Internationally, the slate had been spotlessly\ncleaned. 1945 marked the complete shutdown of any autonomous cocaine\nnetworks that had persisted before the war.  The conflict demolished German,Japanese and Dutch Javan planter and pharmaceutical sources, and in each case\nU.S. Occupations laid down the law on cocaine and other drugs.  The UN lowered\nlicit quotas further (to under 2,000 kilos), and by 1947 the CND adopted coca-eradication itself as a high-profile project, beginning with its traveling 1948-50\u201cCommission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf,\u201d to win approval where it mattered, in\nthe Andes itself.  Signatories of the 1961 Single Convention\u2013this includes Peru and\nBolivia\u2013pledged to fully eradicate the bush and Indian usage in \u201ctwenty-five years\u201d(that would have been 1986, the year of Crack).\n      Thus, by the late 1940s only one world cocaine \u201csource\u201d remained\u2013Peru\u2013and it\nfaced a confident and focused U.S. alone. Indeed, the waning of Peruvianautonomy around drugs dates to the outbreak of the war, and beginning then it gets\nharder to separate the U.S. and Peruvian threads of the story, narratively or\nanalytically. After 1939, many perspectives changed. Peru became a staunchGood-Neighbor ally and goods like cocaine \u201cstrategic\u201d (though this one tacitly)\n                                                          \n25McAllister, Drug Diplomacy , chs. 5-7; Harry J.

The whole notion of \u201cillicit trades\u201d assumed us-vs.-them\nmilitaristic tones, which blended easily into a later hemispheric discourse of war\nagainst drugs. Peru placed novel controls on its cocaine factories and shifted anti-Narcotics offices from national health to police agencies. Officials spoke of putting\nthe whole business under state-monopoly control. Peru began late participation in\nLeague drug-control boards. The U.S., for its part, became blunter and blunterabout cocaine, that is, finally started meddling, and in the post-war, police andtechnical cooperation around drugs began. In a first move to pressure Peru, the\nU.S. temporarily suspended coca imports.\n      These changes were felt down in the Huallaga valley, where the remnants oflegal cocaine met their last stand in 1947-50.  By then, the stakes in legal cocaine\nhad sunk low. Andr\u00e9s Sober\u00f3n, the last producer of note, grasped the dismal\nmarket prospects ahead and under political pressure voluntarily closed shop inearly 1949.  In fact, the whole region was moving in a new direction: jungle\n\u201cdevelopment\u201d\u2013abetted by the United States.  Real roads finally reached a tiny\nHuallaga hamlet called Tingo Mar\u00eda in the late 1930s; nearby Hacendados\nbranched into tea and coffee (Peru\u2019s coca had not replaced it after all.)  The war-\nconfiscated Japanese Tulumayo property was re-baptized as the Peruvian\ngovernment\u2019s \u201cOfficial Colonization Zone,\u201d to draw landless peasant cultivatorsdown from the high Andes. In 1943, the Americans themselves entered this scene,32establishing the \u201cTingo Mar\u00eda Tropical Agricultural Station,\u201d a large model joint-\naid program to bring alternative and strategic commercial crops to the jungle, and\nstudiously ignoring the one already planted there. Under post-war Point-Fourinitiatives, its influence expanded, becoming the hemisphere\u2019s premier tropical\nextension station.\n26\n     In 1948-49, under dramatic and supremely trans-national circumstances,\ncocaine finally became criminalized in Peru.  Many factors and actors convergedhere, making the crackdown on cocaine an over-determined event. The well-\npublicized visit of the UN Coca Commission (which framed coca-leaf as a solvable\ninternational social as well as chemical problem) was largely welcomed by Peru\u2019s\ngoverning and medical class (despite a dissenting Andean science \u201cR\u00e9plica\u201d about\ncoca).  Another UN expert mission worked specifically on narcotics control. The\nabrupt 1948 shift to a hardline pro-U.S. military regime of General Manuel Odr\u00edabrought a classic war mentality to drugs: punitive narcotics codes, anti-cocaine\ncongresses, formation of a national anti-Narcotics squad, a drive to establish a\nsupervisory state coca/cocaine \u201cmonopoly\u201d (ENACO of the 1950s and beyond)and the revocation by fiat of the last private cocaine factory licences.

The FBN-mobilized bust of the \u201cBalerezo\nGang\u201d in July-September 1949 spectacularly put \u201cPeru\u2019s White Goddess\u201d (as Time\ncalled it) on the front page of American papers. It was not spontaneous: U.S.\ncustoms and drug agents had devised an Andean anti-cocaine strategy the year\nbefore. Eighty-three arrests occurred along the primitive ship and trucking corridorconnecting New York City and Hu\u00e1nuco\u2019s jungle. Ex-legal factory people wereamong those arrested, with more to follow.\n27  A remarkable 210 ounces of cocaine\nwas the years\u2019 haul in the U.S., but significantly now all of it was dubbed from\n\u201cPeru.\u201d Anslinger personally called to task Peru\u2019s Ambassadors, but such tacticsproved superfluous, as the operation was declared a triumph. The Generals moved\nin, blamed the local Left (APRA), locked up the last factories, and U.S. drug\nagents began concerted operations, training and assistance in Peru. Drug cops hadcrossed borders and both nationalities liked what they found. Thus ended seven\ndecades of licit cocaine, and globally, the events of 1949 marked the full triumph\nof U.S.-led cocaine prohibitions system.\n                                                          \n27On 1947-50, see Gootenberg, \u201cReluctance or Resistance,\u201d 63-72; best sources are DEA RG170\n06600, Peru/Subject Files, all 1947-52, esp.

In fact by definition it was the birth of\nillicit cocaine, which through a sinuous underground path starting in 1950 would\nby 1980 make 210 ounces, much less the 10 legal tons of yesteryear, seem like apipedream. (By the early 1990s, the best estimates went to over 500-800 tons ofcocaine on delivery to northern markets, an income stream surpassing 30 billion\ndollars, employing untold hundreds of thousands across the Andes, along\nentrenched networks far dispersed from coca\u2019s birthplace in the Huallaga.)\n28\nIncentives to produce got very big, whether one blames a misbegotten global\nsystem (those erected drug prohibitions), insatiable consumer demand (the\nAmerican disease again) or exceptionally evil and/or entrepreneurial drug-runners(the newfangled Colombian \u201ccartels\u201d).  Yet, a close reading suggests a surprising\npattern for casual or interested observers of drug control: the return of cocaine as\nthe socially menacing drug of the 1970s was a socially-unintended outcome ofAmerican drug-suppression action and policies since 1950.\n     There are some real connections, not just long cultural gaps.  DEA-FBN\narchives reveal that we\u2019ve actually been waging a secret war against illicit cocaine35that began in 1950, not in 1975 (when cocaine hit public radar) or1985 (with the\nRepublican escalation of the foreign drug wars). With no licit spaces or political\noptions left, throughout the 1950s and 1960s aspiring cocaine-makers joineddesperate peasants and both in time linked up with a new transnational class of\nLatin illicit traffickers. The kerosene-drenched jungle \u201cpasta b\u00e1sica\u201d of the 1960s\nlooked suspiciously similar to Peru\u2019s old \u201ccoca\u00edna bruta,\u201d and peasant lore citesthose origins.\n29  Locales and supply routes shifted constantly, as dispersing U.S.\nagents frantically sought to damn the dikes at every turn.  In this first stage, the\n\u201ccat and mouse game\u201d of the 1950s and 1960s brought out more dedicated,\ndispersed and professionalized networks of cocaine supply; in a second stage, theprice and substitution incentives of the early 1970s would do the rest.\n     The geography of the \u201cillicit\u201d is traceable.  It began with those busts in\nHu\u00e1nuco\u2013several key prisoners, including Sober\u00f3n himself, had been respectablechemists and workers in legal business of cocaine (though rumors of older\nsmalltime dealing exist too).  By 1951, U.S. intelligence finds Sober\u00f3n hoarding\ncocaine bricks in Huallaga hideouts and dispatching working \u201cexperts\u201d and recipes\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n28 From Patrick L.

Underground labs pop up in deep-jungle Pucalpa and alongthe porous Brazilian frontier, but above all, in Bolivia\u2019s upland Cochabamba\nvalley--a commercial hub above the Yungas, Bolivia\u2019s traditional legal coca\nbasket. Living through stateless social disarray after the 1952 Revolution, Bolivianow incubated illicit cocaine, with dozens of tiny labs mushrooming in and out ofservice, and scandals tarnishing the highest authorities. U.S. drug cops spent the\ndecade chasing down Bolivians across borders, like the legendary female\ntrafficker, Blanca Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Herrera, in league with eager Cuban couriers and backers.By the late 1950s, cocaine labs showed up in far-off Buenos Aires and Mexico, as\nwell as Lima, and then back again in the Huallaga\u2019s Tingo Mar\u00eda and in remote\ndownstream Uchiza.\n30  By the mid-1950s, far more elusive and efficient air\ntransshipment hot spots from the eastern Andes erupt in Panama, Mexico, Brazil,\nEcuador and Cuba.

This tourist mix of\ndecadence was soon displaced by the Revolution.\n     By the early 1960s, U.S. and UN officials were in a quiet panic about cocaine\u2019sillicit re-birth. Even public FBN (then BNDD) reports count annualized U.S.\nborder seizures (a proxy of sorts for consumption) in mounting pounds, not ounces:\n1960--6 pounds; 1963--15 pounds; 1967\u201326 pounds; 1969--52 pounds and in 1971,a whopping 436 pounds. In the early 1960s, INTERPOL tallies cocaine capturedfrom seven Latin American supply points. In 1960, 1962 and 1964 the U.S.\nconvened three major policing conferences for the region\u2013under the cooperative\nguise of \u201cInter-American Consultative Group on the Problems of the Coca-leaf.\u201dThe U.S. was in fact anxious to rally Latin American police to tackle illicit\ncocaine, as well as to jump-start coca-eradication programs from UN illusion to\nworking reality.  A 1966 UN Study Tour zeroed in on clandestine Bolivianproduction, which had now settled in Santa Cruz and the Chapar\u00e9 lowlands, but by\nnow, cocaine was also returning in force to its birthplace, Peru.\n      Between 1970-73, illicit cocaine systematically breaks into U.S. markets: by1973 domestic seizures quadrupled to 452 kilos (i.e., more than 1,000 pounds)\ninvolving some 1,590 cocaine-related arrests. The expensive drug first captures\npublic imagination as a benign 1970s version of the old nervous \u201cbrain-workers\u201dand  \u201csex-workers\u201d salve.  Now these brainy-sexy types were glam rock-stars,38Hollywood elites, fun-bent stockbrokers and a jaded post-Nixonian middle-class\nrevved up on the mounting beat of disco. Cocaine entered the mainstream: it had\nreemerged as the antithesis of the mellow, introspective and sometimes political\u201csixties\u201d drug counter-culture. By 1973 some alarms go off: a Congressional\nmission moves to investigate the Latin cocaine connection; crash-course U.S.\npublic-health studies begin; doctors and sociologists rediscover the lost texts andlessons of the cocaine \u201cepidemic\u201d of the 1890s.  Few initially thought cocaineanything more than a new \u201csoft-drug.\u201d And U.S. officials in Lima begin to\ncarefully monitor the situation: the last year of declassified reports (1973) conveys\na clear sense of emergency, but also a sense of supreme American confidence andcontrol. Given the right dose of aid (a local training program of just $28,000), this\nillicit bloom of Huallaga cocaine will quickly get nipped in the bud.\n31\n     Essential developments also occurred from below in Peru.  In the 1950s and\n1960s, the green Monta\u00f1a districts of Hu\u00e1nuco-San Mart\u00edn emerged as the fastest\nexpanding rural zones in the country, as land-hungry peasants streamed down for\npromises of free parcels and new commercial crops.

By the\nlate 1960s, the old U.S. agrarian station had folded, superceded by Tingo Mar\u00eda\u2019s\nregional technical University, now the Huallaga\u2019s most dynamic commercial pole.The leftist military regime of General Juan Velasco (1968) hoped to intensify thePeruvian state\u2019s presence and services and at last broke the landed estates, but by\n1972 the whole national experiment was collapsing in failure. Jungle regions and\nthousands of families of colonizing peasants were suddenly left to their owndevices, stranded without even much in terms of traditional social authority. (In\nBolivia, a parallel and coeval dynamic of public developmental-colonization\nprojects also lay behind the rise of the Chapar\u00e9 as the Andes second major illicitcoca region.)  Popular memory locates here the origin of the Huallaga Valley coca\nboom, as a return to a reliable staple when nothing else was marketable, amid\ndashed hopes of better lives.\n32  By 1974, local papers buzz with tales of a brash\nnew class of local \u201cNarcos,\u201d based around Tingo.\n                                                          \n32 La Trinchera (Hu\u00e1nuco), all 1974-75  ; NACLA, Report on the Americas \u201cPeru: The Real\nGreen Revolution,\u201d (Kawell and Guti\u00e9rrez investigations) 12/6 1989; Cotler, Drogas y pol\u00edtica\nen el Per\u00fa , pt. 4; Deborah Poole and Geraldo Renique, Peru: Time of Fear (New York Monthly\nReview Press, 1993).40     This boundless region, rich with historic roots in coca and an abandoned\nstateless peasantry, spelled opportunity for whomever bothered to organize them,\nbe they Colombians with Piper-Cubs and dollars from the mid-1970s, or Maoistguerrillas with guns, rules and protection-rackets to follow. Exceedingly weak\nPeruvian governments tolerated the trade, as Peru fell into two decades of\nunremitting political and social chaos, a crisis of state authority and popularsubsistence comparable only to Peru\u2019s breakdown with the War of the Pacific(which had bequeathed the legal cocaine industry a century before). The Huallaga\u2013\nand its expanding coca fields\u2013also lay well off of Lima\u2019s highly preoccupied\nimagination, geographically and politically.  So, it is easy to grasp how subsequentPeruvian administrations, such as they were, read drugs as an American\n\u201cdomestic\u201d problem and foreign-policy obsession\u2013a seemingly valid perspective, if\nonly there were anyone up there to listen. The next time the Americans entered theHuallaga, in the mid-1980s, it was to their \u201cSanta Marta\u201d firebase, the beleaguered\nHQ for a hot regional war on cocaine. Coca cultivators hurried down into even\nmore rugged frontiers; by 1992, Peru had some 129,000 hectares under this illicitcrop\u2013by then, its total criminal cocaine capacity surpassed 1,000 tons.\n     By the early 1970s, the cocaine trail led from the rolling green of the Huallaga\nand lowland Bolivia to coastal Chile, for processing and transshipments. Thatended with an American-backed General there in 1973\u2013finally shifting cocaine\u2019s41current fate to Colombia in the mid-1970s. Colombia, a society itself unraveled by\ndecades of lawlessness and civil strife (aftermaths of La Violencia of the 1950s),\npossessed vibrant pockets of entrepreneurs (in declining Medell\u00edn), a tradition ofcoastal smuggling (of cigarettes and then marihuana to the U.S.) and a diaspora of\nworking emigres from Queens to Miami.\n33  Colombia had scant prior coca culture,\nbut ironically had been the Latin state most enamored of U.S.-drug crusades sincethe 1930s.     The new cocaine market was, to a degree, politically constructed in the north,\nand obeyed an iron law of drugs: suppression of softer stuff leads mainly to the\nharder stuff.

On Nixon\u2019s drug regime, Edward Jay EpsteinAgency of Fear: Opiates and Political Power in America  (London: Verso, rev. ed. 1990) remains\nindispensable.

Many thus embraced cocaine as a harmless or \u201csoft\u201d pleasuredrug. And given the squeeze on other drug imports and routes, one hardly needed a\ncompass to figure out that drug futures lay in high-cost, low-weight, easily-\nconcealed cocaine through a booming \u201cLatin\u201d South Florida.  By the late 1970s,the Colombian groups controlled key processing and distribution points of illicitcocaine, bringing an un-heard-of wholesale entrepot mentality to the trade, for\nexample, the use of cargo jets filled with cocaine. The cocaine glitteratti arrived,\nsoon reflected from below by epidemics of illicit-drug violence, a trail of blood,mayhem and profit from the south Bronx to Medell\u00edn.  All were socially\ninstrumental in coke\u2019s later upgrade from soft to \u201chard-drug\u201d status\u2013but also,\ninevitably, cocaine\u2019s downgraded racial and class prestige. The new U.S.\u201cDAWN\u201d medical warning network helplessly watched the coming flood. Cocaine\nconsumption grew by leaps and bounds to the 1980s, and the innovating\nColombians, and busy Peruvian and Bolivian peasants, kept up with or ahead ofdemand.\n      The rest, one supposes, is \u201chistory.\u201d  The roaring Reagan-Bush eighties became\nthe century\u2019s great cocaine decade.  It shared cultural affinities to superficial get-rich cocaine at the top (greed and excess being \u201cin\u201d again), and from below, the43dreaded and racialist explosion of retail crack cocaine attended its deep social\ninequalities. Scandals over \u201ccrack-babies\u201d (since then much in doubt), militaristic\ndrug-testing on the home front, Nancy\u2019s never-never land of \u201cjust say no,\u201d harshlydiscriminatory crack sentencing, \u201cAndean Initiative\u201d photo-ops, and ritual\ncertification of good and bad drug-allies abroad did not stem the use nor the flow.\nWith cocaine, the shifting balloon effect of illicit drugs continues, given the drug\u2019sspectacular mobility and profit margins (i.e., $100 of peasant coca eventually lendsitself to a northern \u201cstreet-values\u201d of $250,000-$1million), so far only within Latin\nAmerica.  The U.S. war-concept of the 1980s backfired: meant to raise costs for\nprospective drug users, in fact between 1980 and 1988 the wholesale price ofcocaine actually dropped from $60,000 to $10,000 a kilo (given the risk premium,\nsuppliers over-invested in this crop), making cocaine dramatically available to the\nmasses.\n34  When in the early 1980s, U.S. officials moved to cut the Medell\u00edn-\nMiami channel, Cali and northern Mexican drug-lords became the nouveau-riche\ninterlocutors, and considerably tougher targets, both geographically and politically.\n     The escalating U.S. war on drugs of the late 1980s brought endless newfrontiers and militarized front lines of coca by 1990.  In the mid-1990s, a new\n                                                          \n34 From David T. Courtwright, Violent Land: Single Men and Social Disorder from the Frontier\nto the Inner City  (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1996), ch. 12, \u201cThe Crack Era,\u201d 254.\nThis price logic might dispel the popular urge for demonic \u201cCIA\u201d conspiracies on the rise ofcrack, though one needs another leap of faith to grasp the remarkable stupidity of policies thatfueled it.44strong-armed Peruvian state of Alberto Fujimori reasserted itself and bore down\nespecially on the Huallaga valley, now substantially reducing Peru\u2019s coca and\ncocaine paste exports. There, coca prices plummeted, risks shifted again andexhausted yet sensible Huallaga peasants switched sides, to a renewed Peruvian\nstate. Thus an increasingly authoritarian Peru became one of the good U.S. allies.\nSo, peasants in stateless guerrilla-run southeastern Colombia fast learned coca-cocaine culture (and even diversified into high-potency heroin) and this region hasemerged as the Americas\u2019 integrated drug platform, which we are about to wage\nwar on.\n35  Cocaine remains a quite buoyant drug in the U.S.--and now far beyond--\nthough thankfully African-American crack use has fallen in recent years (forunforeseen demographic and social reasons), with heroin on a predictable rebound.\nAn entire generation of young black men has experienced prison rather than say,\ndecent education and jobs, on the cross of our draconian cocaine laws.

Tulchin, Director of the Latin American Program of the WilsonCenter for helping make possible my visit here to Washington.\nCocaine: Global Histories , the book edited last year by Paul Gootenberg,\nplaces in a historical perspective the production and internationalcommercialization of coca and cocaine since the nineteenth century. It puts at the\nforefront of analysis the long-term change in perception suffered by these products:\nfrom one of high international prestige to becoming condemned and ultimatelyprohibited by the international community.  Now, in this paper, the author presents\nus with another ambitious analysis of how specifically U.S.-Peruvian relations\nbecame established around coca and cocaine. This new research adds to thevaluable contributions that he has made generally in Peruvian historiography and\nfor that matter to Latin American history at large.\n                                                          \n38This section is an edited transcript of remarks given at the Wilson Center on 11 May 2000.48     These types of studies have the virtue of reminding us that so-called\n\u201cglobalization\u201d is a long-term result of phenomena rooted in the development of\ncapitalism itself.  Furthermore, relations between the United States and the othercountries of the Western Hemisphere have been marked historically by conflicting\ninterests, which in some cases at least have been favorably managed by the weaker\ngovernments.  This last idea is in itself an important contribution, since it questionssome of the simplistic approaches rooted in dependency perspectives that sodominated Latin-American social thought during the 1960s and 1970s.\n39\n     In a similar vien, I would like to add some comments regarding thedevelopment of U.S.-Peruvian political relations in the last two decades that weredeeply influenced by coca and cocaine. This draws upon the extensive analysis in\nmy recent book Drogas y pol\u00edtica en el Per\u00fa: la conexi\u00f3n norteamericana\n40  (in\nEnglish: Drugs and Politics in Peru: the North-American Connection).\n       In the late 1950s, I had the chance opportunity to chat with three Cuban drug\ndealers who found themselves in prison in Peru. They explained to me that they\nlanded in jail because they did not have\u2013as the Batista cronies did--any U.S.\n                                                          \n39 This theme of weak states confounding imperial ones was fundamental to one of Paul\nGootenberg\u2019s first book, Tejidos y harinas, corazones y mentes: El imperialismo norteamericano\ndel libre comercio en el Per\u00fa 1825-1840  (Lima: Instituto de Estudios Peruanos, 1989).\n40 (Lima: Instituto de Estudios Peruanos, 1999).49officials backing them, and by extension that no Peruvian authorities would help\nthem either, due to Lima\u2019s political alliance with Washington.\n       These drug dealers\u2019 perceptions\u2013whether or not a true or fanciful story\u2013add tothe conception of drugs as like any other commodity placed in the market.\nDifferent interested groups or interest groups will surround them, be they private or\npublic, legal or illegal, at the domestic as well as international levels.  This notionwas around well before the vocabulary of  \u201cglobalization\u201d invaded our politicaldiscourse.\n      The memory of this conclusion came back to me in 1990 when Alberto\nFujimori was first elected president in Peru. At that time, a tense political situationemerged with the U.S., mainly because the Peruvian executive and military held\ndifferent priorities and proposed differing solutions to national problems--\nparticularly the way to handle the growing illicit drug trade.      Prior to the Fujimori regime, the U.S. had not been able to much influence\nPeruvian politics, given his predecessor Alan Garc\u00eda\u2019s nationalistic posture\ntowards Washington and the multilateral organizations, which ended with his starkinternational isolation. The populist agenda pursued by the Garc\u00eda administration\n(1985-1990) unleashed an economic crisis that only led into a cycle of\nhyperinflation. Furthermore, subversive movements (principally, maoist  Sendero\nLuminoso  and their rival the MRTA) continued to grow, due to the military\u2019s50deficient anti-terrorist strategy, one rooted in the systematic repression and\nviolation of human rights. These two conditions contributed to the sustained\ngrowth of illegal coca production in Peru during the 1980s, which allowed thecountry to become the world\u2019s largest supplier of coca paste to the Colombian\ndealers, who of course, produced the cocaine for final sale in the United States.\n      The hyperinflation process, the subversive movements, and illegal drugproduction combined to weaken Peru\u2019s state apparatus and led to the continuingexpansion of illicit and informal actors and modes of behavior.  By 1992, General\n(r.) William E. Odom wrote a report to the Hudson Institute in which he claimed\nthat \u201cfor all practical purposes the State does not exist in Peru.\u201d\n41 The U.S.\ngovernment harbored real fears that Peru\u2019s government might totally disintegrate.\n      In this context, the economic and political crisis inherited by Fujimori allowed\nWashington to exert important leverage.  It became clear to Washington thateconomic improvements and effective law enforcement were the necessary\nconditions for reestablishing order in Peru, and preconditions as well for control\nand reduction of the production and trade of illegal drugs.      Washington and other powers succeeded in convincing Fujimori (against his\ncampaign promises) to apply the recommendations of the so-called \u201cWashington\n                                                          \n41 William E. Odom, Peru: Prospects for Political Stability  (Hudson Institute, 1992), discussed in\nCotler, Droga y Pol\u00edtica, 214-215.51Consensus,\u201d that is to say to implement an economic program characterized by a\nharsh stabilization component as well as a larger package of structural economic\nchange.  Moreover, Washington urged Peru to combine this \u201cneo-liberal\u201deconomic program with a shift in military strategy that emphasized intelligence\nactivities, to efficiently combat both political subversion and the drug trade.\n       In this scenario, Washington put pressure on Peru to adopt certain policies andfight the drug trade.  It made Bush administration guidelines a  condition for\nreceiving badly needed U.S. economic, political and military aid, indispensable for\nthe problems of hyperinflation and subversion.  Notwithstanding the urgency for\nfull American support, the Fujimori administration did not follow the North-American strategy for fighting the coca peasants.  Their refusal was based on the\nprobability that their strategy would cement an alliance among small coca-\nproducers and subversive forces, and thus worsen the military conflict (as isobservable today in Colombia).\n      The American government had to grudgingly accept this reluctance. It had a\nspecial interest in addressing Peruvian dilemmas; though Peru is of modesteconomic and political importance, drugs and guerrillas were seen as wider and\nmore critical regional problems. So, paradoxically, these weak circumstances gave\nthe Peruvian government the possibility to press Washington to accept its positionand, furthermore, to receive some special attention.52     The personal involvement of Hernando de Soto42 in the negotiations with\nWashington made it possible for the White House to grudgingly accept the\nPeruvian position. This was because of the influence that de Soto had wonthroughout Latin America and even within the U.S. with his liberal-market vision\u2013\nactually quoted during a Reagan/Bush State-of-the-Union address. De Soto had\nconfidence that rather than repression, developing a new legal-economicinfrastructure for coca peasants would reduce production of coca and work toisolate peasants from the terrorist movements.\n     On the other hand, the longstanding relationship between Vladimir Montesinos\u2013\nFujimori\u2019s trusted and secretive presidential aide--and the American intelligence\u201ccommunity\u201d (i.e., the CIA) favored understandings between Peruvian military\nofficers and both the American military and the DEA (U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration).      The successful payoff of these relations was soon clear enough.  Peru\u2019s macro-\neconomic rebound of the early-1990s reinforced ties between Fujimori and\noverseas private and public financial institutions. The weakening of the subversivemovements\u2013climaxed by the capture of Abimael G\u00fazman himself in September\n1992--left would-be Narcos without protection and facilitated their prosecution.\n                                                          \n42 Hernando De Soto, gadfly author of the influential \u201clibertarian\u201d book, The Other Path (US ed.,\n1989)  and head of the Institute for Democracy and Liberty (IDL) in Lima, a well-know think-\ntank, supported by the U.S.53This outcome also strengthened the links between Peruvian and American\nmilitaries, and has allowed Montesinos to consolidate his privileged position\nwithin both the Peruvian military and the civil government.      For his ability to restore the country\u2019s governability, Fujimori was exalted by\nWashington, Wall Street and the multilateral organizations, and was even touted as\na symbol or hope of what all Latin American presidents might get done.  In thisway, Fujimori proved able to multiply the support of strategic economic, politicaland military institutions, national and international, and also aroused support from\ndifferent social actors in Peru for the recuperation of waning state authority.  All\nthe while, only the discredited leaders of the traditional political parties struggledagainst Fujimori\u00b4s anti-democratic behavior and criticized the systematic human-\nrights violations of the military. Fujimori rejected all offers of such leaders for\npolitical negotiations. Fujimori and Montesinos, the strong man of the armedforces, believed that participation of other political forces in decision-making\nwould endanger Peru\u2019s economic program, and anti-subversive and anti-drug\ncampaigns, and get in the way of asserting governability. This context helpsexplain how Fujimori was capable--in April of 1992--of overthrowing the elected\nCongress and instituting a so-called \u201csoft\u201d dictatorship ( dictablanda ).\n     The State Department and White House reacted against the anti-constitutionalacts and goals of the Peruvian military, as well as those by governments of Bolivia,54Brazil and Guatemala, that all seemed intent on destroying democratic procedures\nin the name of governance. It seems that the some general confrontation occurred\nwithin the U.S. administration itself, between those officials working to fosterhuman rights and democracy overseas and those military and intelligence agents\nwilling to subordinate these principles to create order--without law--in Peru.\n     Although Fujimori enjoyed transnational support from financial and militaryinstitutions, it was mainly his base of domestic support that allowed him tomanipulate American designs. Later, through successive fraudulent electoral\nprocesses and his grip over of a new Congress, Judiciary and electoral bodies,\nFujimori laid the foundations of the authoritarian regime that still rules Peru today.Thus, Peru\u2019s so-called \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d of the 1990s was able to install itself\nbecause of a mixed internal and external support base for a civil-military regime.\n     Nevertheless, Washington\u2013specifically the State Department and the U.S.Congress--and many private organizations continually criticized Peru\u2019s ongoing\nsystematic violations of human rights. Furthermore, the Peruvian government was\nassailed for their tepid interest in fighting the illicit trade of coca and cocaine, aswell as for suspected military involvement in such illegal trades.\n      To offset such criticisms, build political alliances and win support of crucial\nNorth American politicians, the Peruvian government soon expanded the authorityof the armed forces, and of the military judicial system, in the struggle against the55drug trade.  This militarization strategy proved successful in dampening the\ninfluence of the drug trade, but it also deepened military involvements in Peruvian\nsociety and politics.     Since 1994, military agreements with Washington to intercept cocaine\nexporting air flights have led to systematic reductions of coca cultivation in Peru\n(as well as the dramatic shift of coca-production to Colombia itself). Once again,the US government officially hailed Fujimori for his concerted and effective fightagainst the drug trade. This development\u2013along with a U.S- brokered and\npressured treaty with Ecuador that settled a long-seething border situation--helped\nFujimori polish his image as a maker of government authority, all to the benefit ofhis international credibility.\n      Nevertheless, government successes were obtained through an illegal\nconcentration of power in Fujimori and through the growing autonomy ofMontesinos as chief of the intelligence services and the armed forces. Such a\ncombination left no room for government accountability and fostered the\ndevelopment of crony-ism and clientelism--social traits supposedly dissolved in a\u201cfree-market\u201d society.\n     In short, the overwhelming subordination of Peru\u2019s judicial, civil and military\npower to the personal interests of Fujimori and Montesinos; the repression andblackmail against the political opposition; the censorship exercised by intelligence56services over the news media, especially television; the use of state agencies (with\nmultilateral funds for anti-poverty programs) for favoring the governing bloc, all\nhave helped Fujimori and Montesinos to amass evermore discretionary powers andan arbitrary disregard for law enforcement. This pattern goes against the long-term\ninterests of civil society and its legal and policing institutions, including the fight\nagain drugs, which requires strong respect for law.  Fujimori implemented thedictum attributed to Porfirio Diaz in turn-of-century Mexico: \u201cto my friendseverything, to my enemies the law.\u201d In this way, the deft handling of foreign\neconomic, political and military resources has enabled Fujimori, Montesinos and\nthe military to forge an unprecedented level of political and state autonomy--topromote, indefinitely, their own power in Peru.\n      Nevertheless, such practices have come under increasing fire from different\ntransnational actors. The intense unease of certain American officials with this\noutcome continues on, since Fujimori could undermine all past successes as well as\nencourage other countries to follow the same anti-democratic path, the path of so-\ncalled \u201cauthoritarian liberalism.\u201d     Such uneasiness was felt when Fujimori, through illegal mechanisms and\nelectoral fraud, once again attempted his re-election on April 9\nth of this year [2000]\nagainst Peru\u2019s constitutional term-limit precepts. On this occasion, in league withmassive domestic protests, the State Department, the White House and the57American Congress opened an unexpected campaign against electoral fraud in\nPeru.  This movement even was seconded by the reigning U.S. \u201cdrug-czar\u201d\nGeneral (r) Barry McCaffrey,43 the OAS, the European Union and by a few Latin\nAmerican governments.  Furthermore, a surprising crusade by the international\npress helped discredit the Peruvian regime by widely exposing Fujimori\u00b4s current\npattern of fraud and political intimidation.    Altogether, Peru\u00b4s political mobilizations and the international response forcedthe government to call for a second electoral round in May of this year. The new\nprinciples were fair competition and electoral transparency; however, government\nbehavior was soon blasted by contrary reports from a range of electoral observers,included the Carter Center, the National Democratic Institute and the OAS\nelectoral mission led by Eduardo Stein  Even private banks and public international\nfinancial institutions (IMF, WB, IDB etc.) worry about the fallout of the weaklegitimacy of a ongoing Fujimori administration.     Such reactions surprised\nPeruvian officials and led government spokesmen to claim that new external\npressures constituted an inadmissible intervention in Peru\u00b4s domestic affairs.  Peru,they surmised, faced a global conspiracy of  \u201cneo-colonial\u201d powers trying to\nimpose their Western and liberal values.\n                                                          \n43Now ironically himself, like Fujimori, a prime suspect of investigation into \u201chuman rights\u201d\nviolations: Seymour M. Hersh, \u201cOverwhelming Force: What happened in the final days of theGulf War?\u201d  The New Yorker   22 May 2000.58     However, military support was thrown to Fujimori after the questionable results\nof the second electoral round (the lead opposition candidate, Francisco Toledo,\nhalted his campaign after realizing the high odds of official fraud).  Moreover, theconclusions and recommendations of the OAS mission--to disqualify these\nelections--received faint backing from major Latin American governments, thus\nthe relative isolation of the American position along with Peru\u2019s fragmenteddemocratic forces.  Now, the question is whether this situation will produce in thenear future a new and sharper crisis in Peruvian international relations and political\ninstability; one that ultimately might aggravate the difficult economic situation of\nthe Andean countries, and thus re-stimulate drug production?     My main conclusion is that even given Peru\u2019s quite modest economic and\npolitical weight, the government has been able to manipulate well the national and\ninternational sphere to help in the consolidation of an authoritarian regime.  Theeconomic linkage between American strategy in their \u201cwar on drugs\u201d--taken as a\npill for Peruvian economic ills--helped the armed forces take a decisive role in the\nFujimori government and helped that regime forge national and internationalalliances that supported its authoritarian direction.  These political resources have\nallowed the Peruvian government both to repress national democratic forces and to\nobtain a high degree of autonomy from the external political pressures.  But this59could bring on a new round of economic and social instability in the twenty-first\ncentury, in the interests of neither Peru nor the United States.Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars\nLee H.
