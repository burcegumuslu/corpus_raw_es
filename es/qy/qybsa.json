We are looking for people who are attracted to living a simple and deepen spiritual practice\nKARMA YOGA and SPIRITUAL PRACTICE:\nHere we are aiming to strive towards the highest way of living and are creating a container where we have scheduled times for our spiritual practice and meditations, for our karma yoga, and our free time.\nThe farm is a place to cultivate stillness through practice of yoga's eight limbs and meditation, a place for detoxing on a mental, emotional and physical and therefore we are looking for the right people to come and that would like to join us for our daily meditation and practices\nDETOX AND HEALING:\nOur intention is to slowly begin to offer detox, meditations and silent retreats on the farm, where it\u2019s important for those who would like to come and stay at the farm have interest in healing arts, meditations and living sustainably with nature and the community.

Our diet is vibrant as a lot is coming from local organic farmers and from our farm. We have also establised ourselves in plantbased diet and raw food and encourage those that come to feel out this way of living and thriving. Our kitchen is 100% plantbased and we do not provide any animal sources nor it\u2019s allowed to bring meat, dairy to the kitchen. We are striving to be living and eating from the farm, as of now we are able to provide a large portion of our food from the farm and gardens such as fruits, greens, yucca, beans, sweet potatoes.\nEnvisioned as an INTERGRATION AND MEDITATION CENTER:\nAs a newly born project with the vision of having people coming to heal and practice healing arts, therefore we ask to not bring habits, subtances, alcohol, smokes, meat/dairy to the farm.
