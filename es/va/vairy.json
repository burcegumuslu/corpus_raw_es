However, their limited sensitivity in identifying conditions, such as sepsis,\nA new diagnosis code for COVID-19 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] code U07.1) was introduced on April 1, 2020, to facilitate billing and case monitoring.\nThis study uses national survey data to compare self-reported psychological distress among US adults in April and July 2020 by demographic and stressor type subgroups.\nWe fielded wave 2 of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Civic Life and Public Health Survey from July 7 to July 22, 2020, among US adults aged 18 years and older who responded to wave 1, fielded April 7 to April 13, 2020. The sample was drawn from NORC\u2019s AmeriSpeak panel of approximately 35 000 members sourced from NORC\u2019s area probability sample and from a US Postal Service address-based sample covering 97% of US households.\nThis JAMA Insights review summarizes the pathophysiology underlying the thrombotic diathesis characteristic of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and current recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of the most common thrombotic complications in COVID-19, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischemic stroke, and venous thromboembolism (VTE).\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with arterial and venous thrombotic complications. In a US registry of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), thrombotic complications occurred in 2.6% of 229 non\u2013critically ill hospitalized patients and in 35.3% of 170 hospitalized critically ill patients.\n|ART\u00cdCULOS RECUPERADOS DE LA BASE DE DATOS WHO COVID-19|\nSecondary bacterial and fungal infections are associated with respiratory viral infections and invasive mechanical ventilation. In Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), lung injury by SARS-CoV-2 and impaired immune response can provide a favorable environment for microorganism growth and colonization in hospitalized individuals. Recent studies suggest that secondary bacterial pneumonia is a risk factor associated with COVID-19. In Brazil, knowledge about microbiota present in COVID-19 patients is incipient. This work describes the microbiota of 21 COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units from two Brazilian centers. We identified respiratory, nosocomial and bacterial pathogens as prevalent microorganisms. Other bacterial opportunistic and commensal species are also represented. Virulence factors of these pathogenic species, metabolic pathways used to evade and modulate immunological processes and the interconnection between bacterial presence and virulence in COVID-19 progression are discussed.\nBackground: The propagation of COVID-19 in Spain prompted the declaration of the state of alarm on March 14, 2020. On 2 December 2020, the infection had been confirmed in 1,665,775 patients and caused 45,784 deaths. This unprecedented health crisis challenged the ingenuity of all professionals involved. Decision support systems in clinical care and health services management were identified as crucial in the fight against the pandemic. Methods: This study applies Deep Learning techniques for mortality prediction in COVID-19 patients. Two datasets with clinical information (medication, laboratory tests, vital signs etc.) of 2,307 and 3,870 COVID-19 infected patients admitted to two Spanish hospital chains were used. Firstly, we built a sequence of temporal events gathering all the clinical information for each patient. Next, we used the temporal sequences to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with an attention mechanism exploring interpretability. We conducted extensive experiments and trained the RNNs in different settings, performing hyperparameter search and cross-validation. We ensembled resulting RNNs to reduce variability and enhance sensitivity. Results: We assessed the performance of our models using both global metrics, by averaging the performance across all the days in the sequences. We also measured day-by-day metrics starting from the day of hospital admission and the outcome day and evaluated the daily predictions. Regarding sensitivity, when compared to more traditional models, our best two RNN ensemble models outperform a Support Vector Classifier in 6 and 16 percentage points, and Random Forest in 23 and 18 points. For the day-by-day predictions from the outcome date, the models also achieved better results than baselines showing system's ability towards early predictions. Conclusions: We have shown the feasibility of our approach to predict the clinical outcome (i.e. discharged alive or death) of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The result is a time series model that can support decision-making in healthcare systems and aims at interpretability. Despite the low-resource scenario, the results achieved are promising and suggests that more data will further increase the performance of the model.\nRomania officially declared its first SARS-CoV-2 case on February 26, 2020. The first and largest COVID-19 outbreak in Romania was recorded in Suceava, N/E region of the country, and originated at the Suceava regional county hospital. Following sheltering-in-place measures, infection rates decreased, only to rise again after relaxation of measures. This study describes the incursion of SARS-CoV-2 in Suceava and other parts of Romania and analyzes the mutations and their association with clinical manifestation of the disease during the period of COVID-19 outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis indicated multiple sites of origin for SARS-CoV-2 strains in Suceava, specifically from Spain, Italy and Russia, but also other strains related to those from Czech Republic, Belgium and France. Most Suceava samples contained mutations common to European lineages, such as A20268G, however aproximately 10% of samples were missing such mutations, indicating a possible different origin. While overall genome regions ORF1ab, S and ORF7 were subject to most mutations, several recurring mutations such as C27707T were identified, and these were mainly present in severe forms of the disease. Non-synonymous mutations, such as C3225A (Thr987Asn in NSP3a domain), associated with changes in a protein responsible for decreasing viral tethering in human host were also present. Patients with diabetes and hypertension exhibited eight and three time,s respectively, higher odds ratios of acquiring severe forms of the disease and these were mainly related to C27707T mutation. These results will aid in tracing virus movement throughout Romania and identification of infectivity, virulence and pathogenicity.\nThe disease named COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus,

This article addresses the potential causes of liver function abnormalities in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and management approaches for NPs focusing on preventing and alleviating liver injury.\nThe production of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies is widely considered as a key mechanism for COVID-19 resolution and protection. However, beyond their protective function, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may also participate in disease pathogenesis. To explore the potential relationship between virus-specific humoral responses and COVID-19 immunopathology, we measured serum antibody classes and subclasses to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the nucleoprotein in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe disease. We found that RBD-specific IgG1 and IgG3 dominated the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2, were more abundant in severe patients, and positively correlated with several clinical parameters of inflammation. In contrast, a virus-specific IgA2 response skewed toward RBD rather than NP associated with a more favorable clinical course. Interestingly, RBD-dominant IgA2 responses were mostly detected in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, suggesting the possible involvement of intrinsically tolerogenic gut immune pathways in the attenuation of virus-induced inflammation and disease resolution.\n|DIAGN\u00d3STICO Y SINTOMATOLOG\u00cdA|\nBackground: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an epidemic respiratory infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 infection. Now it is popular all over the world on a large scale. COVID-19 has the characteristics of rapid transmission, atypical clinical symptoms, easy missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis, and so on. which has seriously affected social and economic development and people's health. Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus type 2 infection may lead to systemic cytokine storm, which leads to a sharp deterioration of the condition of ordinary patients. At present, no specific drug has been found in the clinical treatment of covid-19, while Xuebijing injection has been widely used in severe patients in China as a traditional Chinese medicine. The aim of this study is to assess the effificacy and safety of Xuebijing injection for COVID-19.\nThe aims of this meta-analysis were to assess: 1) the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hip fracture patients; 2) the associated mortality rate and risk associated with COVID-19; 3) the patient demographics associated with COVID-19; 4) time of diagnosis; and 5) length of follow-up after diagnosis of COVID-19.\nCONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 was 13%, of which approximately one-third of patients were diagnosed on admission, and was associated with male sex. COVID-19-positive patients had a crude mortality rate of 35%, being seven times greater than those without COVID-19. Due to the heterogenicity of the reported data minimum reporting standards of outcomes associated with COVID-19 are suggested.

However, the performances of these tests have not been systematically evaluated. Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy was used as a guideline for conducting this systematic review.

The pathologic alteration known as diffuse alveolar damage in endothelial and epithelial cells is a critical feature of acute lung injury in ARDS. However, the pathogenesis of ARDS following SRAS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. In the present study, we examined apoptosis in post-mortem lung sections from COVID-19 patients and lung tissues from a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a cell-type manner, including type 1 and 2 alveolar cells and vascular endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages, and T cells. Multiple-target immunofluorescence (IF) assays and western blotting suggest both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 fails to induce apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells (i.e., BEAS2B cells) and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, infection of co-cultured Vero cells and HUVECs or Vero cells and BEAS2B cells with SARS-CoV-2 induced apoptosis in both Vero cells and HUVECs/BEAS2B cells, but did not alter the permissiveness of HUVECs or BEAS2B cells to the virus. Post-exposure treatment of the co-culture of Vero cells and HUVECs with an EPAC1-specific activator ameliorated apoptosis in HUVECs. These findings may help to delineate a novel insight into the pathogenesis of ARDS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nAn ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now the greatest threat to the global public health. Herbal medicines and their derived natural products have drawn much attention to treat COVID-19, but there has been no natural product showing inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection with detailed mechanism. Here, we show that platycodin D (PD), a triterpenoid saponin abundant in Platycodon grandiflorum (PG), a dietary and medicinal herb commonly used in East Asia, effectively blocks the two main SARS-CoV-2 infection-routes via lysosome- and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-driven entry. Mechanistically, PD prevents host-entry of SARS-CoV-2 by redistributing membrane cholesterol to prevent membrane fusion, which can be reinstated by treatment with a PD-encapsulating agent. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of PD are recapitulated by a pharmacological inhibition or gene-silencing of NPC1, which is mutated in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) patients displaying disrupted membrane cholesterol. Finally, readily available local foods or herbal medicines containing PG root show the similar inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study proposes that PD is a potent natural product for preventing or treating COVID-19 and that a brief disruption of membrane cholesterol can be a novel therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nDespite global efforts, there are no effective FDA-approved medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Potential therapeutics focus on repurposed drugs, some with cardiac liabilities. Here we report on a preclinical drug screening platform, a cardiac microphysiological system (MPS), to assess cardiotoxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) polytherapy in a mock clinical trial. The MPS contained human heart muscle derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. The effect of drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements such as QT interval (action potential duration) and drug-biomarker pairing. Chronic exposure to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and increased QT interval from day 6 onwards. AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from day 7 onwards and arrhythmias were observed at days 8 and 10. Monotherapy results closely mimicked clinical trial outcomes. Upon chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 4-8. Interestingly, a decrease in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to monotherapy, in concordance with published clinical trials. Furthermore, biomarkers, most of them measurable in patients serum, were identified for negative effects of single drug or polytherapy on tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection. The cardiac MPS can predict clinical arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation and rhythm instabilities. This high content system can help clinicians design their trials, rapidly project cardiac outcomes, and define new monitoring biomarkers to accelerate access of patients to safe COVID-19 therapeutics.\nBackground: The interaction between COVID-19, non-communicable diseases, and chronic infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis (TB) are unclear, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) in Africa. We investigated this interaction using a nationally representative hospital surveillance system in South Africa. Methods: A national surveillance system for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions (DATCOV) was established. Using DATCOV data, we describe the demographic characteristics, clinical features, and in-hospital mortality among individuals admitted to public and private hospitals with COVID-19 during 5 March to 11 August 2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to compare individuals who were HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected and determine the factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Findings: Hospital admissions peaked at 1,560 admissions per day, in late July. Among the 41,877 individuals admitted with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 7,662 (18.3%) died. Comorbidities were documented in 27,555 (65.8%) individuals, most commonly observed were hypertension (36.8%), diabetes (29.6%), obesity (19.7%), and HIV (8.7%); TB was reported in 0.7% of individuals. Increased risk of in-hospital mortality was associated with HIV and TB, as well as other described risk factors for COVID-19, such as increasing age, male sex, non-White race (Black, mixed and Indian race), chronic underlying conditions particularly hypertension, diabetes and obesity. In addition, HIV-infected individuals with immunosuppression had increased risk of mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.6-3.1). Among HIV-infected individuals, the prevalence of other comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes was 39.9%. The effect of multiple comorbidities on mortality was similar in HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals. Interpretation: These data provide a better understanding of the interaction of non-communicable diseases, chronic infectious diseases like HIV and TB and COVID-19. Increasing age and presence of chronic underlying comorbidities (particularly hypertension and diabetes) are important additional factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in a middle-income African setting and are common among HIV-infected individuals. HIV- and TB-infected individuals, particularly those with additional comorbidities, would benefit from COVID-19 prevention and treatment programmes.\nCOVID-19 manifests with a wide diversity of clinical phenotypes characterized by dysfunctional and exaggerated host immune responses. Many results have been described on the status of the immune system of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, but there are still aspects that have not been fully characterized. In this study, we have analyzed a cohort of patients with mild, moderate and severe disease. We performed flow cytometric studies and correlated the data with the clinical features and clinical laboratory values of patients. Both conventional and unsupervised data analyses concluded that patients with severe disease are characterized, among others, by a higher state of activation in all T cell subsets, higher expression of perforin and granzyme B in cytotoxic cells, expansion of adaptive NK cells and the accumulation of activated and immature dysfunctional monocytes which are identified by a low expression of HLA-DR and an intriguing abrupt change in the expression pattern of CD300 receptors. More importantly, correlation analysis showed a strong association between the alterations in the immune cells and the clinical signs of severity. These results indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 have a broad perturbation of their immune system, and they will help to understand the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19 as well as could be of special value for physicians to decide which specific therapeutic options are most effective for their patients.\nBackground: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 began in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Reports of COVID-19 with central (CNS) and peripheral nervous (PNS) system manifestations are emerging. In this systematic review, we compared and summarized the demographics, clinical features, Brighton criteria, immunological and laboratory findings with a focus on modified Erasmus GBS Outcome Score (mEGOS) in SARS-CoV-2 patients with GBS and its variants.\nCONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is among the first reviews that includes GBS variants and the clinical prediction tool mEGOS for prognostication in COVID-19 patients. Further research is needed to assess whether IVIG is preferable over plasmapheresis in this population of GBS patients. It would also be crucial to follow these patients over time to identify the long-term disability as well as treatment outcomes.\nThe newly emerged coronavirus, which was designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 disease. High effective and well-tolerated medication for hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients is urgently needed. Traditional herbal medicine substances were discussed as promising candidates for the complementary treatment of viral diseases and recently suggested for the treatment of COVID-19. In the present study, we investigated aqueous licorice root extract for its neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, identified the active compound glycyrrhizin and uncovered the respective mechanism of viral neutralization. We demonstrated that glycyrrhizin, the primary active ingredient of the licorice root, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting the viral main protease. Our experiments highlight glycyrrhizin as a potential antiviral compound that should be further investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.\nBackground: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests as a life-threatening microvascular syndrome. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses primarily the capsid spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. To date, it is still not known if the S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is able to trigger vascular cell signalling and provoke cell dysfunction. Methods: We investigated the effects of the recombinant, stabilised S protein on primary human cardiac pericytes (PCs) signalling and function. Endpoints included cell viability, proliferation, migration, cooperation with endothelial cells (ECs) in angiogenesis assays, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Adopting a blocking strategy against the S protein receptors ACE2 and CD147, we explored which receptor mediates the S protein signalling in PCs. Findings: We show, for the first time, that the recombinant S protein alone elicits functional alterations in cardiac PCs. This was documented as: (1) increased migration, (2) reduced ability to support EC network formation on Matrigel, (3) secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules typically involved in the cytokine storm; and (4) production of pro-apoptotic factors responsible for EC death. Furthermore, the S protein stimulates the phosphorylation/activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) through the CD147 receptor, but not ACE2, in cardiac PCs. Accordingly, the neutralization of CD147, using a blocking antibody, prevented the activation of ERK1/2 and partially rescued the PC function in the presence of the S protein. Interpretation: Our findings suggest the new, intriguing hypothesis that the S protein may elicit vascular cell dysfunction, potentially amplifying, or perpetuating, the damage caused by the whole coronavirus. This mechanism may have clinical and therapeutic implication.\nAims: This meta-analysis provides summary odds ratio (OR) estimates for associations between treatment with (vs. without) renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers and risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) severity (including case-fatality) in patients with hypertension, and in all patients (irrespective of hypertension).\nCONCLUSION: ACE inhibitors and ARBs appear safe in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be discontinued. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020186996.\nMany recent studies have investigated the role of either Chloroquine (CQ) or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) alone or in combination with azithromycin (AZM) in the management of the emerging coronavirus.

Almost all subjects with COVID-19 develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) within 3 weeks after infection. No data are available on the seroconversion rates of cancer patients and COVID-19.\nCancer patients may have a higher risk of severe events and unfavourable outcomes in the setting of COVID-19. This review addresses the question of whether to test asymptomatic cancer patients before initiating systemic cancer treatments.\nCONCLUSION: There is a lack of studies which directly address COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic patients before treatment. Our systematic review showed that most of the published data favours routine test for SARS-CoV-2 before initiating systemic treatment but failed to identify a good level of evidence to support these recommendations. Based upon this review, we proposed local recommendations at our centre. Each institution should consider the pros and cons of testing asymptomatic patients,...\nBackground: Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 has currently affected 8,015,502 million people worldwide with global mortality around 5%.

Methods We analysed the sera of 1655 adult employees for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using the S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Sera containing S1-reactive antibodies were further evaluated for receptor-binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific antibodies in relation to the neutralisation test (NT) results at 0, three and six months. Findings We found immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgA antibodies reactive to the S1 protein in 10.15% (n=168) of the participants. In total, 0.97% (n=16) were positive for S1-IgG, 0.91% (n=15) were S1-IgG- borderline and 8.28% (n=137) exhibited only S1-IgA antibodies. Next, we evaluated the 168 S1-reactive sera for RBD- and NCP specificity: 8.33% (n=14) had detectable RBD-specific and 6.55% (n=11) NCP-specific antibodies. The latter correlated with NTs (kappa coefficient = 0.8660) but started to decline already after 3 months. RBD-specific antibodies correlated best with the NT (kappa = 0.9448) and only these antibodies were stable for up to six months. All participants with virus-neutralising antibodies reported symptoms, of which, anosmia and/or dysgeusia correlated best with the detection of virus-neutralising antibodies. Interpretation RBD-specific antibodies were most reliably detected post infection, independent of the number/severity of symptoms, and correlated best with protective neutralising antibodies at least for six months. They thus qualify best for large-scale seroepidemiological evaluation of both seroprevalence and seroprotection.\nCOVID-19 patients elicit strong responses to the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 but binding antibodies are also detected in prepandemic individuals, indicating potential crossreactivity with common cold human coronaviruses (HCoV) and questioning its utility in seroprevalence studies. We investigated the immunogenicity of the full-length and shorter fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and the crossreactivity of antibodies with HCoV. We indentified a C-terminus region in SARS-CoV2 N of minimal sequence homology with HCoV that was more specific and highly immunogenic. IgGs to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 N also recognised N229E N, and IgGs to HKU1 N recognised SARS-CoV-2 N. Crossreactivity with SARS-CoV-2 was stronger for alpha- rather than beta-HCoV despite having less sequence identity, revealing the importance of conformational recognition. Higher preexisting IgG to OC43 N correlated with lower IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in rRT-PCR negative individuals, reflecting less exposure and indicating a potential protective association. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N were higher in patients with more severe and longer symptoms and in females. IgGs remained stable for at least 3 months, while IgAs and IgMs declined faster. In conclusion, N is a primary target of SARS-CoV-2-specific and HCoV crossreactive antibodies, both of which may affect the acquisition of immunity to COVID-19.\nIntroduction The public health measures imposed to contain Covid-19 during the first UK lockdown resulted in significant changes in the provision of community support and care for people with dementia. People with low prevalence and young-onset dementias often experience non-memory, behavioural or neuropsychiatric symptoms that require specialised support. Objective We explored the impact of the first Covid-19 lockdown on people living with low prevalence and young-onset dementia and their carers in the UK. Method An online survey, including eleven questions about the impact of the lockdown on both the person with dementia and their family caregivers was conducted. Participants were people living with dementia and caregivers who are members of the UK national-reach organisation Rare Dementia Support. Results 184 carers and 24 people with dementia completed the survey. People with dementia experienced worsening of cognitive symptoms (70%), ability to do things (62%) and well-being (57%) according to their carers. Carers also reported a reduction in the support received for caring (55%). 93% of carers of people living in care homes reported a reduction in their ability to provide care. 26% of carers reported changes in the medication of the person with dementia during the lockdown. 74% of people with dementia reported decreased ability to connect with people socially. Conclusions People with dementia experienced a worsening of dementia symptoms, removal of support and increased difficulty to connect with other people socially during the 1st wave of Covid-19. Carers encountered barriers to both receiving and providing support and a decline in their own mental health and well-being.\nObjective: This study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum and its association with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single tertiary care hospital and included consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables, including required oxygen supplementation, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality, were examined. Results: Fifty-six patients were included in the study. The median age was 54.5 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those without detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (78 vs. 50 years; P = .0013). RNAemia was detected in 19.6% of patients (11/56) and in 1.0% (1/25), 50.0% (6/12), and 100.0% (4/4) of moderate, severe, and critically ill cases, respectively. Patients with RNAemia required more frequent oxygen supplementation (90.0% vs. 13.3%; P < .0001) and ICU admission (81.8% vs. 6.7%; P < .0001) and required invasive mechanical ventilation (27.3% vs. 0.0%; P < .0001). Among patients with RNAemia, the median viral loads of NP swabs that were collected around the same time as the serum were significantly higher in critically ill cases (5.4 Log10 copies/L [IQR: 4.2-6.3]) than in moderate-severe cases (2.6 Log10 copies/L [1.1-4.5]; P =.030) and were significantly higher in nonsurvivor cases (6.2 Log10 copies/L [IQR: 6.0-6.5]) than in survivor cases (3.9 Log10 copies/L [1.6-4.6]; P =.045). Conclusions: This study demonstrated a relatively high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and an association between RNAemia and clinical severity. Moreover, among the patients with RNAemia, the viral loads of NP swabs were correlated with severity and mortality, thus suggesting the potential utility of combining serum testing with NP tests as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19 with a higher quality than each separate test.\n|NOTICIAS EMITIDAS|\n|DESTACADAS DE LA SEMANA|\nEl Gobierno cubano continu\u00f3 adoptando acciones para incrementar las medidas de contenci\u00f3n ante la COVID-19, con casos generados principalmente por nacionales procedentes del extranjero, por los contactos de estos \u2014que son mayoritariamente sus familiares\u2014, y por personas contagiadas por estos \u00faltimos.A partir del 10 de enero todos los viajeros que lleguen al pa\u00eds deber\u00e1n portar un PCR en tiempo real realizado como m\u00e1ximo 72 horas antes por laboratorios certificados de los pa\u00edses de origen.\nLa nueva cepa del COVID-19 es entre 50 y 74% m\u00e1s contagiosa afirm\u00f3 un estudio m\u00e9dico que advirti\u00f3 sobre sus consecuencias en Reino Unido.\nLa aparici\u00f3n de una nueva cepa del coronavirus en Reino Unido caus\u00f3 p\u00e1nico en todo el mundo, provocando que una decena de capitales cancelaran vuelos con el pa\u00eds, que qued\u00f3 aislado.
