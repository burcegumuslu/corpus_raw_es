Factors such as chemical agents, radiation, immunosuppression, and genetic syndromes and abnormalities are involved in their etiology. Case report: A 64-year-old man developed a skin lesion on the right cheek one year earlier at the site where he had presented a basal cell carcinoma 20 years earlier that was treated with radiation therapy. After ruling out the existence of metastasis, the lesion was treated by surgical resection with safety margins and reconstruction with the Mustard\u00e9 flap. Treatment was supplemented with radiation therapy. Discussion: The diagnosis of sarcomas is histopathologic and it is essential to rule out metastasis. To improve survival and reduce the high rate of recurrence, a multidisciplinary approach to treatment should be used (surgery\n[Terapeutica de enfermagem nos casos de prolapso uterino](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0034-71671990000100026&lng=en&tlng=en) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nElaine Blanco Rodrigues\n1990-12-01\nFull Text Available Trabalho realizado no Hospital Universit\u00e1rio \"Pedro Ernesto\" UERJ.

The most frequent are osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma/PNET, in an older adults are seen chondrosarcomas, other ones are rare. In general, biology of sarcomas is closely related to pediatric malignancies with fast growth, local aggressiveness, tendency to early hematogenic dissemination and chemo sensitivity. Diagnostics and treatment of bone sarcomas should be done in well experienced centres due to low incidence and broad issue of this topic. An interdisciplinary approach and staff education is essential in due care of patients with bone sarcoma. If these criteria are achieved, the cure rate is contemporary at 65 - 70 %, while some subpopulation of patients has chance for cure up to 90 %.

The vast majority of diagnosed sarcomas will be soft tissue sarcomas, while malignant bone tumors make up just over 10% of sarcomas. The risks for sarcoma are not well-understood. We evaluated the existing literature on the epidemiology and etiology of sarcoma. Risks for sarcoma development can be divided into environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility, and an interaction between the two. HIV-positive individuals are at an increased risk for Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, even though HHV8 is the causative virus. Radiation exposure from radiotherapy has been strongly associated with secondary sarcoma development in certain cancer patients. In fact, the risk of malignant bone tumors increases as the cumulative dose of radiation to the bone increases (p for trend\n[ACCESIBILIDAD A LOS SERVICIOS DE SALUD EN LA PR\u00c1CTICA DE CITOLOG\u00cdA RECIENTE DE CUELLO UTERINO EN UNA ZONA URBANA DE COLOMBIA](http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=17078307) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nDiego Iv\u00e1n Lucum\u00ed Cuesta\n2004-01-01\nFull Text Available Fundamento: El c\u00e1ncer de cuello uterino es un problema de salud p\u00fablica en pa\u00edses en desarrollo.

The cutaneous presentation of these tumours is rare. With the evolution of dermatologic surgery and cutaneous oncology, dermatologists have emerged as specialists for skin cancer management. This article reviews primary cutaneous sarcomas with particular emphasis on the epidemiologic, clinical, and histological features of diagnosis, as well as treatment modalities and prognosis. The most frequent cutaneous sarcomas were reviewed, including angiosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, atypical fibroxanthoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, malignant nerve sheath tumor, and epithelioid sarcoma. Kaposi's sarcoma, due to specific characteristics, was omitted from this review.\n[International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nKirova, Y.M.; Belembaogo, E.; Frikha, H.; Yu, S.J.; Le Bourgeois, J.P.\n1997-01-01\nMoriz Kaposi was the first who, in 1872, described five patients presenting with 'sarcoma idiopathicum multiple hemorrhagicum'. In 1912 Sternberg termed this disease Kaposi's sarcoma. Since then various forms of this rare disease have been observed. In 1914 Hallenberg described the first cases of African or endemic Kaposi's sarcoma. In the 1960's the first reports discussing Kaposi's sarcoma following organ transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy were published. After 1981, the epidemic form associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was described. All these forms, their history, treatment methods and the role of radiation therapy in the management of this rare malignancy are discussed, and the literature is reviewed.

They may arise as primary tumors in either bone or soft tissue, with approximately 11,280 soft tissue tumors and 2,650 bone tumors diagnosed each year in the United States. There are at least 50 different subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma, with new ones described with ever-increasing frequency. One way to look at sarcomas is to divide them into categories on the basis of their genetic make-up. One group of sarcomas has an identifiable, relatively simple genetic signature, such as the X:18 translocation seen in synovial sarcoma or the 11:22 translocation seen in Ewing's sarcoma. These specific abnormalities often lead to the presence of fusion proteins, such as EWS-FLI1 in Ewing's sarcoma, which are helpful as diagnostic tools and may become therapeutic targets in the future. Another group of sarcomas is characterized by complex genetic abnormalities as seen in leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and undifferentiated sarcoma. It is important to keep these distinctions in mind when contemplating the development of targeted agents for sarcomas. Different abnormalities in sarcoma could be divided by tumor subtype or by the molecular or pathway abnormality. However, some existing drugs or drugs in development may interfere with or alter more than one of the presented pathways.

A strong relationship exists between Ewing's sarcoma and tumors of neural origin (Ewing family of tumors). Ewing's sarcoma must be distinguished from other round-cell tumors like lymphoma and neuroblastoma and also must be differentiated from osteogenic sarcomas. On plain radiographs, Ewing's sarcoma appears as a lytic or mixed lytic-sclerotic, rarely as predominantly sclerotic lesion with margins Lodwick grade III. It is located primarily in the diaphyseal and metadiaphyseal regions of the long bones of the lower extremities. A large soft tissue tumor is usually present. Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice to evaluate the extent of the primary lesion, to monitor the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to follow up non-resected Ewing's sarcomas. Bone scintigraphy is necessary to detect skeletal metastasis, and 201 thallium scanning has been shown to be sensitive in the monitoring of treatment response.

Although most sarcomas are localized, many display a remarkable predilection for metastasis to the lungs, liver, bones, subcutaneous tissue, and lymph nodes. Additionally, many sarcoma patients presenting initially with localized disease may relapse at metastatic sites. While localized sarcomas can often be cured through surgery and often radiation, controversies exist over optimal management of patients with metastatic sarcoma. Combinations of chemotherapy are the most effective in many settings, and many promising new agents are under active investigation or are being explored in preclinical models. Metastatic sarcomas are excellent candidates for novel approaches with additional agents as they have demonstrated chemosensitivity and affect a portion of the population that is motivated toward curative therapy. In this paper, we provide an overview on the common sarcomas of childhood (rhabdomyosarcoma, adolescence, and young adults (osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and older adults (leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and undifferentiated high grade sarcoma in terms of the epidemiology, current therapy, promising therapeutic directions and outcome with a focus on metastatic disease.

Diagnosis is often made following surgery for presumed benign disease. Currently, preoperative imaging does not reliably distinguish between benign leiomyomas and other malignant pathology. Uterine leiomyosarcoma is the most common sarcoma, but other subtypes include endometrial stromal sarcoma (low grade and high grade, undifferentiated uterine sarcoma and adenosarcoma. Clinical trials have shown no definite survival benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy and have been hampered by the rarity and heterogeneity of these disease types. There is a role of adjuvant treatment in carefully selected cases following multidisciplinary discussion at sarcoma reference centers. In patients with metastatic disease, systemic chemotherapy can then be considered. There is activity of a number of agents, including doxorubicin, trabectedin, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, eribulin and pazopanib. Patients should be considered for clinical trial entry where possible. Close international collaboration is important to allow progress in this group of diseases.

Although most sarcomas are localized, many display a remarkable predilection for metastasis to the lungs, liver, bones, subcutaneous tissue, and lymph nodes. Additionally, many sarcoma patients presenting initially with localized disease may relapse at metastatic sites. While localized sarcomas can often be cured through surgery and often radiation, controversies exist over optimal management of patients with metastatic sarcoma. Combinations of chemotherapy are the most effective in many settings, and many promising new agents are under active investigation or are being explored in preclinical models. Metastatic sarcomas are excellent candidates for novel approaches with additional agents as they have demonstrated chemosensitivity and affect a portion of the population that is motivated toward curative therapy. In this paper, we provide an overview on the common sarcomas of childhood (rhabdomyosarcoma), adolescence, and young adults (osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor) and older adults (leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and undifferentiated high grade sarcoma) in terms of the epidemiology, current therapy, promising therapeutic directions and outcome with a focus on metastatic disease. Potential advances in terms of promising therapy and biologic insights may lead to more effective and safer therapies; however, more clinical trials and research are needed for patients with metastatic sarcoma.

Diagnosis is often made following surgery for presumed benign disease. Currently, preoperative imaging does not reliably distinguish between benign leiomyomas and other malignant pathology. Uterine leiomyosarcoma is the most common sarcoma, but other subtypes include endometrial stromal sarcoma (low grade and high grade), undifferentiated uterine sarcoma and adenosarcoma. Clinical trials have shown no definite survival benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy and have been hampered by the rarity and heterogeneity of these disease types. There is a role of adjuvant treatment in carefully selected cases following multidisciplinary discussion at sarcoma reference centers. In patients with metastatic disease, systemic chemotherapy can then be considered. There is activity of a number of agents, including doxorubicin, trabectedin, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, eribulin and pazopanib. Patients should be considered for clinical trial entry where possible. Close international collaboration is important to allow progress in this group of diseases.\n[Radiosensitivity of soft tissue sarcomas](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=20075831) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nHirano, Toru; Iwasaki, Katsuro; Suzuki, Ryohei; Monzen, Yoshio; Hombo, Zenichiro\n1989-01-01\nThe correlation between the effectiveness of radiation therapy and the histology of soft tissue sarcomas was investigated. Of 31 cases with a soft tissue sarcoma of an extremity treated by conservative surgery and postoperative radiation of 3,000-6,000 cGy, local recurrence occurred in 12; 5 out of 7 synovial sarcomas, 4 of 9 MFH, one of 8 liposarcomas, none of 4 rhabdomyosarcomas and 2 of 3 others. As for the histological subtyping, the 31 soft tissue sarcomas were divided into spindle cell, pleomorphic cell, myxoid and round cell type, and recurrence rates were 75%, 33.3%, 16.7% and 0%, respectively. From the remarkable difference in recurrent rate, it was suggested that round cell and myxoid type of soft tissue sarcomas showed a high radiosensitivity compared to the spindle cell type with low sensitivity. Clarifying the degree of radiosensitivity is helpful in deciding on the management of limb salvage in soft tissue sarcomas of an extremity. (author)\n[Postirradiation sarcoma in retinoblastoma.

We present four new cases and report 57 others from the English literature. Osteogenic sarcoma was the predominant histologic type (58%), followed by fibrosarcoma (21%) and various other sarcomas (21%). The average latency period between irradiation and development of the second primary (sarcoma) was 12.4 years. Irrespective of irradiation, a genetic linkage between retinoblastoma and osteogenic sarcoma on the 13q14 chromosome is recognized. Through a pleiotropic effect of this same chromosome, a predisposition for other sarcomas may exist as well. Finally, a strong role for radiation induction is proposed for all of these postirradiation sarcomas. This is based on the increased number of sarcomas arising in the field of prior irradiation (sites uncharacteristic of spontaneously occurring primary sarcomas) and the prolonged latency periods.13 references\n[Targeted therapies for bone sarcomas](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=48040839) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nMudry, P.\n2011-01-01\nTherapy success in bone sarcoma is significantly better compared to history cohorts with 60 - 70 % overall survival to date.

Post-radiation sarcomas is a rare entity and large series have rarely been reported. In order to improve knowledge about this entity the Radiotherapist group of the French Cancer Centres (FNCLCC) decided to collect retrospectively the cases treated in their institutions. In order to be sure of the histology, all the cases were reviewed by a panel of pathologists of the FNCLCC Pathologist group. A total of 129 cases of sarcomas, and 108 were reviewed; analysis of 8 is in progress, and no material was obtained in the other 11 cases. The diagnosis of sarcomas was confirmed in 80 cases. All patients (60 F, 20 M) have received radiation therapy (median dose 50 Gy; 9-110 Gy) for the treatment of the primary tumor. At this time the age was 44 years (6-83 y). Diagnoses included: breast C. 42%, Lymphomas 11.5%, gynaecological C. 10% benign lesions 5% miscellaneous. Sarcomas developed after a mean interval of 12 years (3-64 y), in bone in 30% of the cases and in soft tissue in 70%. The majority of lesions (90%) developed in the irradiated field (dose received was between 50 Gy and 60 Gy).

Advances in molecular biology have revealed common chromosomal translocations such as EWS-FLI1 among Ewing sarcoma and related diseases such as primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), so these are considered as Ewing sarcoma family tumor (ESFT). Although fewer than 10% of patients with ESFT survived before establishment of modern multiagent chemotherapy, the multimodal therapeutic regimens including combination chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery can cure 60% of patients with localized disease, due to the collaborative research in European-American or the international trials. The standard chemotherapy for localized ESFT now comprises vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (VACD) in Europe or vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and etoposide (VDC-IE) in North America. Meanwhile, those with metastatic disease have a much worse outcome with an approximately 10-30% 5-year event-free survival rate. New American-European collaborative trials such as EURO-E.W.I.N.G. 99 are in progress for further improvement of the cure rate in localized and metastatic ESFT.

It has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Its four distinct clinical forms are: classic, endemic, iatrogenic and epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma. In non-HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, the disease is typically limited to the lower extremities, but in immunodeficient patients, it is a multifocal systemic disease. The clinical course of the disease differs among patients, ranging from a single or a few indolent lesions to an aggressive diffuse disease. Advanced Kaposi's sarcoma lesions, typically those on the lower extremities, are often associated with lymphedema.

The 12 patients from the IESS protocols with hand or foot Ewing sarcoma are comparable to those already reported in the literature. With the exception of lesions in the calcaneus, the prognosis for disease-free survival is excellent. The radiographic features of hand and foot Ewing sarcoma are generally those of classic Ewing sarcoma: permeation, soft-tissue mass, and often, associated sclerotic reaction. However, with the exception of sclerosis, features suggesting bone reaction and slow tumor growth in these patients were distinctly uncommon compared with Ewing sarcoma in general. Apparently location of the lesion is important, since in the reported cases in the literature and in this series, lesions of the calcaneus fared poorly. The importance of this set of patients therefore relates to awareness and early recognition of an unusual appearance and location of Ewing sarcoma\n[Propuesta de programa educativo sobre enfermedades del cuello uterino](http://www.revfinlay.sld.cu/index.php/finlay/article/view/51) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nGrisel Mariela Mass Basulto\n2011-12-01\nFull Text Available Fundamento: El c\u00e1ncer ginecol\u00f3gico est\u00e1 entre las m\u00e1s frecuentes causas de muerte en la poblaci\u00f3n femenina.

At the molecular genetic level Ewing's sarcoma is characterized by a balanced reciprocal translocation, t(11;22)(q24;q12), which encodes an oncogenic fusion protein and transcription factor EWS/FLI. This tumor-specific chimeric fusion retains the amino terminus of EWS, a member of the TET (TLS/EWS/TAF15) family of RNA-binding proteins, and the carboxy terminus of FLI, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. In addition to EWS/FLI, variant translocation fusions belonging to the TET/ETS family have been identified in Ewing's sarcoma. These studies solidified the importance of TET/ETS fusions in the pathogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma and have since been used as diagnostic markers for the disease. EWS fusions with non-ETS transcription factor family members have been described in sarcomas that are clearly distinct from Ewing's sarcoma. However, in recent years there have been reports of rare fusions in \"Ewing's-like tumors\" that harbor the amino-terminus of EWS fused to the carboxy-terminal DNA or chromatin-interacting domains contributed by non-ETS proteins. This review aims to summarize the growing list of fusion oncogenes that characterize Ewing's sarcoma and Ewing's-like tumors and highlights important questions that need to be answered to further support the existing concept that Ewing's sarcoma is strictly a \"TET/ETS\" fusion-driven malignancy. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of action of the various different fusion oncogenes will provide better insights into the biology underlying this rare but important solid tumor.

New entities have been described, while malignant histiocytofibroma, the most diagnosed sarcoma type during the last two decades, has been dismembered. As for prognosis, the new UICC classification is effectively more discriminating in the definition of prognostic groups; but the usefullness of new biological or genetic markers remains to be assessed. Several breakthrough have taken place in the last years in the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Isolated limb perfusion with TNF, hyperthermia and melphalan have proven its efficacy, and is now an alternative to preoperative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for limb sparing treatment of the primary tumor site or to amputation. For systemic treatments, novel cytostatic drugs have been shown to be active in sarcomas, including ecteinascidine (ET743) and Glivec (STI571). This last drug has been shown to be remarkably active in c-kit+ stromal sarcoma of the gastro-intestinal tract. It can hopefully regarded as an example for targeted therapies, which may come with a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms triggered by the fundamental, specific genetic alterations shown in sarcoma.\n[Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nRichard F.

We reviewed the current evidence on this relationship, focusing particularly on the studies that had individual estimates of radiation doses. There is clear evidence of an increased risk of both bone and soft tissue sarcomas after high-dose fractionated radiation exposure (10 + Gy in childhood, and the risk increases approximately linearly in dose, at least up to 40 Gy. There are few studies available of sarcoma after radiotherapy in adulthood for cancer, but data from cancer registries and studies of treatment for benign conditions confirm that the risk of sarcoma is also increased in this age-group after fractionated high-dose exposure. New findings from the long-term follow-up of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors suggest, for the first time, that sarcomas can be induced by acute lower-doses of radiation (\n[Uterine sarcoma \u2013 current perspectives](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=5587218)\nBenson, Charlotte; Miah, Aisha B\n2017-01-01\nUterine sarcomas comprise a group of rare tumors with differing tumor biology, natural history and response to treatment. Diagnosis is often made following surgery for presumed benign disease. Currently, preoperative imaging does not reliably distinguish between benign leiomyomas and other malignant pathology. Uterine leiomyosarcoma is the most common sarcoma, but other subtypes include endometrial stromal sarcoma (low grade and high grade), undifferentiated uterine sarcoma and adenosarcoma. Clinical trials have shown no definite survival benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy and have been hampered by the rarity and heterogeneity of these disease types. There is a role of adjuvant treatment in carefully selected cases following multidisciplinary discussion at sarcoma reference centers. In patients with metastatic disease, systemic chemotherapy can then be considered. There is activity of a number of agents, including doxorubicin, trabectedin, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, eribulin and pazopanib. Patients should be considered for clinical trial entry where possible. Close international collaboration is important to allow progress in this group of diseases.

MR is the technique of choice to determine to local extension of malignant soft tissue tumors. To assess the clinical and MR imaging parameters associated with synovial sarcomas that aid in establishing their diagnosis. We review the clinical findings and images of 23 histologically confirmed synovial sarcomas that were studied by MR. Synovial sarcomas usually develop in young adults as soft tissue tumors, preferentially in the deep tissues of an extremity in close proximity to a joint. They are characterized as having a lobulated contour and septa, frequently infiltrating neighboring tissues at some point, and are heterogeneous. The presence of hemorrhage, as well as infiltration of the fascia in subcutaneous tumors, suggests the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma. The development of perilesional edema is not uncommon. Although, logically, the clinical and radiological features of synovial sarcomas can overlap with those of other soft tissue tumors, the findings described here are fairly characteristic of these lesions: thus, when present, they should serve to orient the diagnostic process.

Although its mechanism has not been fully illustrated, recent work on autophagy in various types of sarcomas has demonstrated that autophagy exerts an important role in sarcoma cell growth and proliferation, in pro-survival response to therapies and stresses, and in therapeutic resistance of sarcoma. Thus, the autophagic process is being seen as a possibly novel therapeutic target of sarcoma. Additionally, some co-regulators of autophagy have also been investigated as promising biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of sarcoma. In this review, we summarize contemporary advances in the role of autophagy in sarcoma and discuss the potential of autophagy as a new target for sarcoma treatment.

The median for latent period from irradiation to diagnosis of bone sarcoma was 11 years with a minimum latent period of four years. The median radiation dose for the bone sarcoma was 6000 rad in 6 weeks with a minimum total radiation dose of 3000 rad in 3 weeks. We have found nine patients who developed bone sarcomas in the radiation field after successful treatment of Hodgkin's disease.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate oral AIDS-Kaposi's sarcoma for detection of KSHV/HHV-8 DNA. DNA extracted from 54 oral AIDS-Kaposi's sarcoma lesions (47 initial, 7 postvinblastine treated), 5 non-Kaposi's sarcoma HIV-positive lesions, and 3 non-Kaposi's sarcoma HIV-negative lesions was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (KS330(233bp)amplicon) for KSHV/HHV-8. The AIDS-Kaposi's sarcoma study population consisted of 52 patients (51:1, men:woman; 92% men having sex with men, 8% heterosexual; mean age, 38 years; mean, CD4 59/mm3) Opportunistic infections occurred in 88% (candidiasis, 65%; Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, 31%; nonoral Kaposi's sarcoma, 25%; mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI), 16%; cytomegalovirus, 14%; herpes simplex virus, 14%). Sexually transmitted diseases occurred in 73% (gonorrhea, 37%; syphilis, 23%; condyloma, 22%; HSV, 16%). Most frequent lesion sites were palate (74%) and gingiva (17%). Most common lesion types were purple nodular (48%) and macular (42%). Histopathologic subtypes were nodular (71%), plaque (27%), and patch (2%). Polymerase chain reaction analysis detected KSHV/HHV-8 DNA in 53 of 54 AIDS-Kaposi's sarcoma lesions (47 of 47 initial, 6 of 7 postvinblastine treatment). KSHV/HHV-8 DNA was not detected in non-Kaposi's sarcoma lesions in HIV-positive or HIV-negative persons. KSHV/HHV-8 DNA sequence is present in a high proportion of oral AIDS-Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. Whether KSHV/HHV-8 is an etiologic agent or a cofactor in the development of this vascular neoplasm is uncertain and remains to be proven. Polymerase chain reaction analysis for KSHV/HHV-8 DNA sequence detection may be helpful in identifying Kaposi's sarcoma in early vascular proliferations, when the characteristic histopathologic features are not present.\n[Positron emission tomography with fluorine-deoxyglucose in sarcomas and non-sarcoma non-epithelial tumors](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=44091538) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nMassardo, Teresa; Jofre, Maria Josefina; Sierralta, Maria Paulina; Canessa, Jose; Castro, Gabriel; Berrocal, Isabel; Gallegos, Ivan\n2012-01-01\nBackground: The usefulness of positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-deoxyglucose (FDG) in sarcomas and non-sarcoma non-epithelial (NSNE) tumors is not clearly defined.

Surgery, radiation and chemotherapy are currently the only standard treatments for sarcoma. However, their response rates to chemotherapy are quite low. Toxic side effects and multi-drug chemoresistance make treatment even more challenging. Therefore, better drugs to treat sarcomas are needed. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC inhibitors, HDACi, HDIs) are epigenetic modifying agents that can inhibit sarcoma growth in vitro and in vivo through a variety of pathways, including inducing tumor cell apoptosis, causing cell cycle arrest, impairing tumor invasion and preventing metastasis. Importantly, preclinical studies have revealed that HDIs can not only sensitize sarcomas to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but also increase treatment responses when combined with other chemotherapeutic drugs. Several phase I and II clinical trials have been conducted to assess the efficacy of HDIs either as monotherapy or in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents or targeted therapeutic drugs for sarcomas. Combination regimen for sarcomas appear to be more promising than monotherapy when using HDIs. This review summarizes our current understanding and therapeutic applications of HDIs in sarcomas.

While significant advances have been made in improving outcomes of patients with localized pediatric sarcomas since the addition of systemic chemotherapy to local control many decades ago, outcomes for patients with metastatic and relapsed sarcoma remain poor with few novel therapeutics identified to date. With the advent of new technologies to study cancer genomes, transcriptomes and epigenomes, our understanding of sarcoma biology has improved tremendously in a relatively short period of time. However, much remains to be accomplished in this arena especially with regard to translating all of this new knowledge to the bedside. To this end, a meeting was convened in Philadelphia, PA on April 18, 2015 sponsored by the QuadW foundation, Children\u2019s Oncology Group and CureSearch for Children\u2019s Cancer that brought together sarcoma clinicians and scientists from North America to review the current state of pediatric sarcoma biology and ongoing/planned genomics based clinical trials in an effort to identify and bridge knowledge gaps that continue to exist at the current time. At the conclusion of the workshop, three key objectives that would significantly further our understanding of sarcoma were identified and a proposal was put forward to develop an all-encompassing pediatric sarcoma biology protocol that would address these specific needs. This review summarizes the proceedings of the workshop.

Despite its uncommon occurrence, sarcoma research has provided the means for groundbreaking research that has advanced our understanding of general cancer mechanisms. It is through sarcoma research that the pioneering efforts of cancer immunotherapy were explored, that we understand the inherent genetic nature of cancer mutations, and that we appreciate the subclassification of general cancer types to make more accurate prognoses. This review explores the brief history of sarcoma research and what sarcomas can still teach us about the future of cancer research, especially in regard to novel immunotherapy targets, the role of epigenetics in disease progression and chemoresistance, and the benefits of more focused clinical trials.

As part of a protocol for intra-arterial chemotherapy 12 patients with biopsy proven synovial sarcoma underwent angiography. The angiograms on these patients were reviewed to determine whether synovial sarcomas and their variants demonstrated a characteristic angiographic appearance. Synovial sarcomas appeared angiographically as soft tissue masses which showed a fine network of tumor vessels with an inhomogeneous capillary blush. Their degree of vascularity varied according to their histopathology. Monophasic synovial sarcomas demonstrated in general a higher degree of neovascularity than the biphasic form. This finding was also suggested by histopathologic analysis of the vessels in the tumor. Although angiography did not show a distinctive vascular pattern it may be useful to evaluate tumor size and vascularity.

It usually arises from the pelvis, followed by the femur, tibia, and remainder of both the long bones of the extremities and flat bones of the axial skeleton. To the best of our knowledge, Ewing's sarcoma of the patella has never been reported previously. Patellar tumors occur infrequently and represent an uncommon etiology of anterior knee pain. We describe the rare case of a 41-year-old man who presented with a 3-4 month history of escalating right anterior knee pain and swelling. Imaging demonstrated an aggressive patellar tumor with an adjacent soft tissue mass. The diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma was confirmed by pathology. Physicians should be aware of atypical locations for Ewing's sarcoma and, conversely, of rare tumors arising in the patella and accounting for anterior knee pain.

We assessed pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, for safety and activity in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma. In this two-cohort, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study, we enrolled patients with soft-tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma from 12 academic centres in the USA that were members of the Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC). Patients with soft-tissue sarcoma had to be aged 18 years or older to enrol; patients with bone sarcoma could enrol if they were aged 12 years or older. Patients had histological evidence of metastatic or surgically unresectable locally advanced sarcoma, had received up to three previous lines of systemic anticancer therapy, had at least one measurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1, and had at least one lesion accessible for biopsy. All patients were treated with 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response. Patients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab were included in the safety analysis and patients who progressed or reached at least one scan assessment were included in the activity analysis. Accrual is ongoing in some disease cohorts. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02301039. Between March 13, 2015, and Feb 18, 2016, we enrolled 86 patients, 84 of whom received pembrolizumab (42 in each disease cohort) and 80 of whom were evaluable for response (40 in each disease cohort). Median follow-up was 17\u00b78 months (IQR 12\u00b73-19\u00b73).

They can be classified into over 50 subtypes, accounting for approximately 1% of adult and 15% of pediatric cancers. Wide surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are the most common treatments for the majority of sarcomas. Among these therapies, chemotherapy can palliate symptoms and prolong life for some sarcoma patients. However, sarcoma cells can have intrinsic or acquired resistance after treatment with chemotherapeutics drugs, leading to the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). MDR attenuates the efficacy of anticancer drugs and results in treatment failure for sarcomas. Therefore, overcoming MDR is an unmet need for sarcoma therapy. Certain protein kinases demonstrate aberrant expression and/or activity in sarcoma cells, which have been found to be involved in the regulation of sarcoma cell progression, such as cell cycle, apoptosis, and survival. Inhibiting these protein kinases may not only decrease the proliferation and growth of sarcoma cells, but also reverse their resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs to subsequently reduce the doses of anticancer drugs and decrease drug side-effects. The discovery of novel strategies targeting protein kinases opens a door to a new area of sarcoma research and provides insight into the mechanisms of MDR in chemotherapy. This review will focus on the recent studies in targeting protein kinase to reverse chemotherapeutic drug resistance in sarcoma. Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We identified 300 patients with new primary Ewing's sarcoma diagnosed between 1980 and 2005 from the centres' local database. There were 253 (84%) with skeletal and 47 (16%) with extra-skeletal Ewing's sarcomas. Although patients with skeletal Ewing's were younger (mean age 16.8 years) than those with extra-skeletal Ewing's sarcoma (mean age 27.5 years), there was little difference between the groups in terms of tumour stage or treatment. Nearly all the patients were treated with chemotherapy and most had surgery. There was no difference in the overall survival of patients with skeletal (64%) and extra-skeletal Ewing's sarcoma (61%) (p = 0.85), and this was also the case when both groups were split by whether they had metastases or not. This large series has shown that the oncological outcomes of Ewing's sarcoma are related to tumour characteristics and patient age, and not determined by whether they arise in bone or soft tissue.\n[Is There a Predisposition Gene for Ewing's Sarcoma?](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2010/397632) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nR. L. Randall\n2010-01-01\nFull Text Available Ewing's sarcoma is a highly malignant tumor of children and young adults. The molecular mechanisms that underlie Ewing's Sarcoma development are beginning to be understood. For example, most cases of this disease harbor somatic chromosomal translocations that fuse the EWSR1 gene on chromosome 22 with members of the ETS family. While some cooperative genetic events have been identified, such as mutations in TP53 or deletions of the CDKN2A locus, these appear to be absent in the vast majority of cases. It is therefore uncertain whether EWS/ETS translocations are the only consistently present alteration in this tumor, or whether there are other recurrent abnormalities yet to be discovered. One method to discover such mutations is to identify familial cases of Ewing's sarcoma and to then map the susceptibility locus using traditional genetic mapping techniques. Although cases of sibling pairs with Ewing's sarcoma exist, familial cases of Ewing's sarcoma have not been reported. While Ewing's sarcoma has been reported as a 2nd malignancy after retinoblastoma, significant associations of Ewing's sarcoma with classic tumor susceptibility syndromes have not been identified. We will review the current evidence, or lack thereof, regarding the potential of a heritable condition predisposing to Ewing's sarcoma.\n[Is There a Predisposition Gene for Ewing's Sarcoma?](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=2838402)\nRandall, R.

Over the last few decades, traditional treatment with surgery and/or chemotherapy has not significantly improved outcomes for most types of sarcomas. In recent years, there have been significant advances in the understanding of specific gene mutations that are important in driving the pathogenesis and progression of sarcomas. Identification of these new gene mutations, using next-generation sequencing and advanced molecular techniques, has revealed a range of potential therapeutic targets. This, in turn, may lead to the development of novel agents targeted to different sarcoma subtypes. In this review, we highlight the advances made in identifying sarcoma gene mutations, including those of p53, RB, PI3K and IDH genes, as well as novel therapeutic strategies aimed at utilizing these mutant genes. In addition, we discuss a number of preclinical studies and ongoing early clinical trials in sarcoma targeting therapies, as well as gene editing technology, which may provide a better choice for sarcoma patient management.

Patients diagnosed with retroperitoneal...... sarcoma in the southern Sweden health care region 2003-2009 were eligible for the study. Data on referrals and diagnostic investigations were collected from clinical files from primary health care, local hospitals, and from the sarcoma centre. Lead times were divided into patient delays and health care...... at the general practitioner, 36 days at local hospitals, and 55 days at the sarcoma centre. Conclusion. Centralization per se is not sufficient for optimized and efficient management.

Surgery is essential modality, but the use of combined treatment (standard combination of surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy in selected cases and perioperative rehabilitation) in highly-experienced centers increased possibility of cure and limitations of extent of local surgery. Current combined therapy together with the use of reconstructive methods allows for limb-sparing surgery in majority of soft tissue sarcoma patients (amputation in 10% of cases as compared to approximately 50% in the 1960 - 70s). The slow, but constant, increase of rate of soft tissue sarcoma patients with long-term survival has been observed. Contemporary 5-year overall survival rate in patients with extremity soft tissue sarcomas is 55 -78%. In case of diagnosis of metastatic disease the prognosis is still poor (survival of approximately 1 year). Good results of local therapy may be expected only after planned (e.g., after preoperative biopsy - tru - cut or incisional) radical surgical excision of primary tumor with pathologically negative margins (R0 resection). Following appropriate diagnostic check-up, adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary in the majority of patients treated with radical surgery need, as well as long-term rehabilitation and follow-up examinations in treating center are needed for at least 5 years. The progress is due to the introduction of targeted therapy acting on molecular or genetic cellular disturbances detected during studies on etiopathogenetic mechanisms of sarcoma subtypes. In view of rarity of sarcomas and necessity of multidisciplinary therapy, the crucial issue is that management of these tumors should be hold in experienced oncological sarcoma centers.

Although more than 100 different histologic subtypes have been described, the majority of pediatric cases belong to the Ewing\u2019s family of tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Most patients that present with localized stage are curable with surgery and/or chemotherapy; however, those with metastatic disease at diagnosis or those who experience a relapse continue to have a very poor prognosis. New therapies for these patients are urgently needed. Immunotherapy is an established treatment modality for both liquid and solid tumors, and in pediatrics, most notably for neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. In the past, immunomodulatory agents such as interferon, interleukin-2, and Liposomal-muramyl tripeptide phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (L-MTP have been tried, with some activity seen in subsets of patients; additionally, various cancer vaccines have been studied with possible benefit. Monoclonal antibody therapies against tumor antigens such as disialoganglioside GD2 or immune checkpoint targets such as CTLA4 and PD-1 are being actively explored in pediatric sarcomas. Building on the success of adoptive T cell therapy for EBV-related lymphoma, strategies to redirect T cells using chimeric antigen receptors and bispecific antibodies are rapidly evolving with potential for the treatment of sarcomas. This review will focus on recent preclinical and clinical developments in targeted agents for pediatric sarcomas with emphasis on the immunobiology of immune checkpoints, immunoediting, tumor microenvironment, antibody engineering, cell engineering, and tumor vaccines. The future integration of antibody based and cell based therapies into an overall treatment strategy of sarcoma will be discussed.\n[Ewing's Sarcoma Localized in the Mandible: A Case Report](https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=od_______908::2ea75bd48f713283a9550662a0496566)\nAkbayram, S; Ba\u015faranoglu, M; Kaya, A; A\u00e7\u0131kg\u00f6z, M; \u00dcstyol, L; Ta\u015fk\u0131n, GA; Dogan, M\n2015-01-01\nEwing's sarcoma is one of the most aggressive primary bone tumours.

We have evaluated the risk of second malignancies (SM) in patients treated in the German Cooperative Ewing's Sarcoma Studies CESS 81 and CESS 86. Materials and methods: From January 1981 through June 1991, a total number of 674 patients was registered in the two multicentric Ewing's sarcoma trials CESS 81 (1981 through 1985) and CESS 86 (1986 through June 1991). The systemic treatment consisted in both studies of a four-drug-chemotherapy (VACA= vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide and adriamycin; or VAIA= vincristine, actinomycin D, ifosfamide and adriamycin) and a total number of four courses, each lasting nine weeks, was recommended by the protocol. Local therapy was either complete surgery or surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy with 36-46Gy or definitive radiotherapy with 46 to 60Gy. The median follow-up at the time of this analysis was 7 years, the maximum follow-up 16 years. Results: Eight patients developed a SM, 4 were acute myelogenic leucemias, three sarcomas and one benign neurinoma. One of the sarcomas was considered as radiation-induced because of its location in the former radiation field.

The pathogenesis of many of these is poorly understood, but others have begun to reveal the secrets of their inner workings. With considerable effort over recent years, soft tissue sarcomas have increasingly been classified on the basis of underlying molecular alterations. In turn, this has allowed the development and application of targeted agents in several specific, molecularly defined, sarcoma subtypes. This review will focus the rationale for targeted therapy in sarcoma, with emphasis on the relevance of specific molecular factors and pathways in both translocation-associated sarcomas and in genetically complex tumors. In addition, we will address some of the early successes in sarcoma targeted therapy as well as a few challenges and disappointments in this field. Finally we will discuss several possible opportunities represented by poorly understood, but potentially promising new therapeutic targets, as well as several novel biologic agents currently in preclinical and early phase I/II trials.

She died due to metastasis after five months of surgery.\n[Intraneural synovial sarcoma of the median nerve](http://www.pagepress.org/journals/index.php/rt/article/view/1755) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nRahul Kasukurthi\n2010-06-01\nFull Text Available Synovial sarcomas are soft-tissue malignancies with a poor prognosis and propensity for distant metastases. Although originally believed to arise from the synovium, these tumors have been found to occur anywhere in the body. We report a rare case of synovial sarcoma arising from the median nerve. To our knowledge, this is the twelfth reported case of intraneural synovial sarcoma, and only the fourth arising from the median nerve. Because the diagnosis may not be apparent until after pathological examination of the surgical specimen, synovial sarcoma should be kept in mind when dealing with what may seem like a benign nerve tumor.\n[Characteristics of 64 sarcoma patients referred to a sarcoma center after unplanned excision.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26776152)\nDyrop, Heidi Buvarp; Safwat, Akmal; Vedsted, Peter; Maretty-Kongstad, Katja; Hansen, Bjarne Hauge; J\u00f8rgensen, Peter Holmberg; Baad-Hansen, Thomas; Keller, Johnny\n2016-02-01\nUnplanned excision of sarcoma before referral to specialist centers can affect prognosis and surgical outcome. The diagnostic pathway of these patients is uncertain and needs to be reviewed. We aimed to describe patient and tumor characteristics, initial symptoms, initial and final diagnosis, and explore reasons for unplanned excision in this patient group. From a previous study on 258 sarcoma patients, we identified 64 patients referred after surgery. Medical records were reviewed. The majority were soft tissue sarcomas, most often with thoracic location. Leiomyosarcoma was the most frequent final diagnosis, lipoma, and fibroma/dermatofibroma the most frequent initial diagnoses. Fifty percent were superficial small tumors, and 60.9% had not received diagnostic imaging before surgery. Fifty percent were referred from public surgical departments, and 1/3 from private specialists. Twenty-three patients had initial presence of alarm symptoms registered before surgery, the remaining 2/3 fell outside referral criteria or alarm symptoms were not discovered. Patients referred after unplanned excision often have small superficial tumors and the majority fall outside of defined referral criteria. Referral criteria are not a guarantee for detection of all sarcomas and surgeons should always be aware of the possibility of malignancy when removing a tumor. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n[[Primitive cutaneous Ewing's sarcoma: a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21570564)\nDelaplace, M; M\u00e9lard, P; Perrinaud, A; Gor\u00e9, C; Vergier, B; Machet, L\n2011-05-01\nEwing's sarcoma (or peripheral neuroectodermal tumour) is generally found in bone tissue, and a primary dermal site is extremely rare. We report a case of primary cutaneous Ewing's sarcoma in a 21-year-old woman. A 21-year-old woman presented with a scapular lesion that had been slowly developing for one year. The 1-cm lesion was removed and histological examination showed proliferation of small round cells in the dermis. Immunostaining revealed cytoplasmic membrane expression of CD99 and a negative immunoprofile for other small round-cell tumors. Ewing's sarcoma fusion gene transcripts were detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). A staging examination revealed no other abnormalities. It was decided to treat the lesion as for osseous Ewing's sarcoma with wide resection followed by systemic adjuvant chemotherapy. Cutaneous Ewing's sarcoma raises concerns about diagnosis and treatment. Owing to the non-specificity of its clinical presentation, histology and immunoprofile, diagnosis of superficial Ewing's sarcoma is difficult and numerous differential diagnoses must be considered. When dealing with a surface tumour, the diagnosis of cutaneous Ewing's sarcoma must be considered. CD99 immunostaining and molecular testing for evidence of EWSR1 rearrangement are useful investigations to confirm the diagnosis. Furthermore, modalities of treatment must be carefully discussed. Cutaneous Ewing's sarcoma is currently treated in the same way as osseous Ewing's sarcoma (wide surgical excision, adjuvant radiotherapy when surgical margins are unsatisfactory, systemic adjuvant chemotherapy, and, in some cases, bone marrow transplant). However, some studies show a more favourable prognosis for cutaneous Ewing's sarcoma than for osseous Ewing's sarcoma. We may thus ask whether such aggressive multimodal treatment is needed.

We report our preliminary experience with thallium-201 scintigraphy in nine AIDS patients with proved Kaposi sarcoma. Eight of the nine had abnormal uptake of the radionuclide in skin, lymph nodes, oral cavity, vagina, and lungs. Only four of the nine had cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma at the time of scanning. All cutaneous and mucosal lesions were thallium avid. Two of the six patients with thallium-avid nodes underwent nodal biopsy. Both biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma. Cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma developed later in one of these patients, showing the efficacy of thallium scintigraphy for the early detection of extracutaneous lesions.

We report a NUTM2A-CIC fusion sarcoma in a 43-year-old woman who died of rapidly progressive disease. Histologic analysis revealed multinodular proliferation of small round tumor cells with mild nuclear pleomorphism. The sclerotic fibrous septa separated the tumor into multiple nodules. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for vimentin, focally positive for cytokeratin, and negative for CD99 and NKX2.2. Tumor cells were also negative for ETV4, which was recently identified as a specific marker for CIC-rearranged sarcoma. High-throughput RNA sequencing of a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded clinical sample unveiled a novel NUTM2A-CIC fusion between NUTM2A exon 7 and CIC exon 12, and fluorescence in situ hybridization identified CIC and NUTM2A split signals. This case shared several clinicopathological findings with previously reported CIC-rearranged cases.

A 24-year-old female with previous history of pelvis Ewing's sarcoma and recently discovered lung metastases, presented with moderate headache for the past 2 weeks and weakness in her left leg for the past 2 days. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an extra-axial right frontoparietal mass invading the superior sagittal sinus but with clear delineation with brain parenchyma. Imaging features were suggestive of a meningioma as no abnormalities in the skull abutting to the tumor were noted. The patient underwent surgical removal of her tumor. Near total resection was achieved and histological examination showed evidence of metastatic Ewing's sarcoma. Postoperative adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy were administered. The patient improved well postoperatively with full recovery of her motor weakness. She is symptom free with no signs of progression, at most recent follow-up, 8 months after surgery. Despite its rarity, metastatic Ewing's sarcoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis of extra-axial dural masses particularly meningiomas.\n... Livingstone; 2014:chap 88.

Sarcomas represent approximately 1% of malignancies with retroperitoneal sarcomas representing 10-15% of all soft tissue sarcomas. Surgery is currently the only modality which offers the chance of cure. Surgery for retroperitoneal sarcomas presents specific challenges due their location in a complex space surrounded by vital structures and visceral organs often prohibiting resection with wide margins. Furthermore, even after complete resection local recurrence is common and the leading cause of death. In this article the authors describe the initial investigations, prognostic factors and optimal surgical management.

Ten sarcomas were primary, de novo tumors. Nine others developed secondary osteogenic sarcomas; among these, six arose as a complication of Paget's disease, two followed irradiation, and one was associated with pre-existent fibrous dysplasia. The sarcomas arose in equal proportion in both sexes with the men being much older (mean age, 44 years) as compared to the women (mean age, 31 years). Patients with de novo osteogenic sarcomas were considerably younger than those with secondary lesions. Osteoblastic osteogenic sarcoma was by far the most common histologic variant in both the primary and the Paget's sarcomas. None of the patients with Paget's sarcoma lived longer than 1 year; the median survival here was 4 months. Patients with de novo osteogenic sarcomas fared much better and there are four long-term survivors (longer than 3 years) who are currently disease-free\n[Physiotherapy management of patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15790255)\nHarris-Love, Michael O; Shrader, Joseph A\n2004-01-01\nKaposi's sarcoma is the most common form of cancer in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although Kaposi sarcoma lesions may contribute to significant physical impairments, there is a lack of scientific literature detailing the role of physiotherapy in the treatment of HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. The present Case Report includes two males, aged 36 and 39 years, seropositive for HIV with invasive Kaposi's sarcoma. Patient A was evaluated for bilateral foot pain caused by plantar surface Kaposi s sarcoma lesions that rendered him unable to walk. He progressed to walking 400feet after a treatment regimen of gait training with the use of custom plastazote sandals. Patient B was evaluated for right lower extremity lymphoedema secondary to invasive Kaposi's sarcoma. He experienced an 18% reduction in limb volume, a 38% reduction in pain and a 20 degrees increase in terminal knee flexion after therapeutic exercise and the use of compressive bandaging and garments. This Case Report suggests that physiotherapy interventions may be valuable in the conservative management of patients with HIV-associated Kaposi s sarcoma.\n[[Molecular biology for sarcoma: useful or necessary?].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25533919)\nNeuville, Agn\u00e8s; Coindre, Jean-Michel; Chibon, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\n2015-01-01\nSarcomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors. Their diagnosis is based on morphology and immunohistochemical profile, with categories of tumors according to the type of tissue that they resemble. Nevertheless, for several tumors, cellular origin is unknown. Molecular analysis performed in recent years allowed, combining histophenotype and genomics, better classifying such sarcomas, individualizing new entities and grouping some tumors. Simple and recurrent genetic alterations, such as translocation, mutation, amplification, can be identified in one of two sarcomas and appear as new diagnostic markers. Their identification in specialized laboratories in molecular pathology of sarcomas is often useful and sometimes necessary for a good diagnosis, leading to a heavy and multidisciplinary multi-step treatment.

Its antagonistic behavior inhibits the receptor's tyrosine kinase activity, thereby, turning off the downstream signaling cascades responsible for soft tissue sarcoma tumorigenesis. In October 2016, olaratumab received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its use in combination with doxorubicin for treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Areas covered: This drug profile takes a comprehensive look at the clinical studies leading to FDA approval of olaratumab as well as its safety and efficacy as a front-line treatment option for sarcoma patients. The literature search was primarily conducted using PubMed. Expert commentary: The combination of olaratumab plus doxorubicin has provided a new front-line therapeutic option for soft tissue sarcoma patients. An open-label phase Ib and randomized phase II trial in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma demonstrated that the addition of olaratumab to doxorubicin prolonged progression-free survival by 2.5 months and overall survival by 11.8 months when compared to doxorubicin alone. Of importance, this clinically meaningful increase in overall survival did not come at the expense of a significantly greater number of toxicities.

They are exceedingly rare in adults, but much more common in children. The historically recent advent of cytotoxic chemotherapy for pediatric sarcomas has revolutionized the treatment of these diseases and dramatically improved their prognoses. There is thus a population of pediatric sarcoma survivors that are \u201ccoming of age\u201d as adults. However, this progress is not without consequences. Due to aggressive treatment protocols that include various combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, pediatric sarcoma survivors are at risk of myriad physical, medical, and psychological difficulties as they enter adulthood. These include but are not limited to physical disabilities, chemotherapy-induced cardiac issues, second malignancies, and anxiety. These patients pose unique challenges to their adult primary care physicians. One possible solution to these challenges is multidisciplinary sarcoma survivorship clinics.

These guidelines utilized a customized MediaWiki software application for guideline development and are the first evidence-based guidelines for clinical management of sarcoma. This paper presents our experience with developing and implementing web-based interactive guidelines and reviews some of the challenges and lessons from adopting an evidence-based (rather than consensus-based) approach to clinical sarcoma guidelines. Digital guidelines can be easily updated with new evidence, continuously reviewed and widely disseminated.

Radiological diagnosis prior to hysterectomy is difficult, with the diagnosis frequently made post-operatively. Current staging systems have been unsatisfactory, although a new FIGO staging system specifically for uterine sarcomas has now been introduced, and may allow better grouping of patients according to expected prognosis. While the mainstay of treatment of early disease is a total abdominal hysterectomy, it is less clear whether routine oophorectomy or lymphadenectomy is necessary. Adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy may improve local tumour control in high risk patients, but is not associated with an overall survival benefit. Similarly there is no good evidence for the routine use of adjuvant chemotherapy. For advanced leiomyosarcoma, newer chemotherapy agents including gemcitabine and docetaxel, and trabectedin, offer some promise, while hormonal therapies appear to be more useful in endometrial stromal sarcoma. Novel targeted agents are now being introduced for sarcomas, and uterine sarcomas, and show some indications of activity. Non-pharmacological treatments, including surgical metastatectomy, radiofrequency ablation, and CyberKnife radiotherapy, are important additions to systemic therapy for advanced metastatic disease.\n[Sarcomas associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer: broad anatomical and morphological spectrum](http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/1188259) [DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nNilbert, Mef; Therkildsen, Christina; Nissen, Anja\n2009-01-01\n-register to identify HNPCC families in which sarcomas had been diagnosed.

Management of RPS is complex and requires multidisciplinary, tailored treatment strategies at all stages, but especially in the context of metastatic or multifocal recurrent disease. Due to the rarity and heterogeneity of this family of diseases, the literature to guide management is limited. The Trans-Atlantic Retroperitoneal Sarcoma Working Group (TARPSWG) is an international collaboration of sarcoma experts from all disciplines convened in an effort to overcome these limitations. The TARPSWG has compiled the available evidence surrounding metastatic and multifocally recurrent RPS along with expert opinion in an iterative process to generate a consensus document regarding the complex management of this disease. The objective of this document is to guide sarcoma specialists from all disciplines in the diagnosis and treatment of multifocal recurrent or metastatic RPS. All aspects of patient assessment, diagnostic processes, local and systemic treatments, and palliation are reviewed in this document, and consensus recommendations provided accordingly. Recommendations were guided by available evidence, in conjunction with expert opinion where evidence was lacking. This consensus document combines the available literature regarding the management of multifocally recurrent or metastastic RPS with the practical expertise of high-volume sarcoma centers from multiple countries. It is designed as a tool for decision making in the complex multidisciplinary management of this condition and is expected to standardize management across centers, thereby ensuring that patients receive the highest quality care.\n[Sarcoma de Kaposi em paciente transplantada renal em uso de Fk-506 Kaposi's Sarcoma in a renal transplant patient receiving Fk-506](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0365-05962002000600008) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nJorge David Rocha Zanol\n2002-12-01\nFull Text Available O Sarcoma de Kaposi (SK \u00e9 neoplasia maligna multic\u00eantrica, cut\u00e2nea e extracut\u00e2nea, que tem sido descrita em pacientes transplantados renais que recebem terapia imunossupressora cl\u00e1ssica.

Cancers frequently evade the potent antitumour surveillance mechanisms of p53 through mutation of the TP53 gene, with approximately 50% of all human malignancies expressing dysfunctional, mutated p53 proteins. Interestingly, genetic lesions in the TP53 gene are only observed in 10% of Ewing Sarcomas, with the majority of these sarcomas expressing a functional wild-type p53. In addition, the p53 downstream signaling pathways and DNA-damage cell cycle checkpoints remain functionally intact in these sarcomas. This paper summarizes recent insights into the functional capabilities and regulation of p53 in Ewing Sarcoma, with a particular focus on the cross-talk between p53 and the EWS-FLI1 gene rearrangement frequently associated with this disease. The development of several activators of p53 is discussed, with recent evidence demonstrating the potential of small molecule p53 activators as a promising systemic therapeutic approach for the treatment of Ewing Sarcomas with wild-type p53.

Two gastric leiomyosarcomas of the stomach were diagnosed 26 and 14 years after treatment and a malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the anterior chest wall was removed six years after gastric irradiation. Of 743 peptic ulcer patients treated without irradiation and constituted as a control group for the study of therapeutic gastric radiation, none is known to have developed sarcoma. As the incidence of sarcoma in these patient groups is known only from the tumor registry of the University of Chicago, other cases of sarcoma may exist in the groups.

Because of this philosophy, patients who present with locally advanced, unresectable sarcomas often are treated in a palliative fashion, usually with low-dose radiotherapy. Over the last 6 years, 29 patients with unresectable primary or metastatic sarcomas were treated using a combination of intravenous chemical radiosensitizers and high-dose irradiation. Twenty-two of 29 patients achieved clinical local control, with six patients having a complete clinical response. The time to tumor response is often several months or longer, which is in contrast to other tumor histologies (carcinomas, lymphomas), where tumor response usually occurs over several weeks. Several large tumors have shown only a minimal tumor response, yet were found to be sterilized in posttreatment biopsy or autopsy examination. Of 15 patients with primary sarcomas without metastases, 11 patients (73%) remain free of local tumor progression from 12 to 83 months. Adult high-grade sarcomas can be controlled with high-dose radiotherapy and intravenous radiosensitizers, although the precise role of these agents is unclear\n[Adult prostate sarcoma: the M. D.

At last followup, 8 patients had no evidence of disease after a median of 81.5 months (range 10 to 197). The remaining 13 patients died of sarcoma (median survival 18 months, range 3 to 94). The 1, 3 and 5-year actuarial survival rates for all 21 patients were 81%, 43% and 38%, respectively. Factors predictive of long-term survival were negative surgical margins (p = 0.0005) and absence of metastatic disease at presentation (p = 0.0004). Tumor size and grade, and the histological subtype of prostate sarcoma had no significant influence on actuarial survival. The long-term disease specific survival rate for adults with prostate sarcoma is poor. Early diagnosis and complete surgical resection offer patients the best chance for cure.\n[Ewing sarcoma versus osteomyelitis: differential diagnosis with magnetic resonance imaging](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00256-013-1632-5) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nHenninger, B.; Glodny, B.; Rudisch, A.; Trieb, T.; Loizides, A.; Judmaier, W.; Schocke, M.F.; Putzer, D.\n2013-01-01\nTo find and evaluate characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns for the differentiation between Ewing sarcoma and osteomyelitis. We identified 28 consecutive patients referred to our department for MRI (1.5 T) of an unclear bone lesion with clinical symptoms suggestive of Ewing sarcoma or osteomyelitis. MRI scans were re-evaluated by two experienced radiologists, typical MR imaging features were documented and a diagnostic decision between Ewing sarcoma and osteomyelitis was made. Statistical significance of the association between MRI features and the biopsy-based diagnosis was assessed using Fisher's exact test. The most clear-cut pattern for determining the correct diagnosis was the presence of a sharp and defined margin of the bone lesion, which was found in all patients with Ewing sarcoma, but in none of the patients with osteomyelitis (P < 0.0001). Contrast enhancing soft tissue was present in all cases with Ewing sarcoma and absent in 4 patients with osteomyelitis (P = 0.0103). Cortical destruction was found in all patients with Ewing sarcoma, 4 patients with osteomyelitis did not present any cortical reaction (P = 0.0103). Cystic or necrotic areas were identified in 13 patients with Ewing sarcoma and in 1 patient with osteomyelitis (P = 0.004). Interobserver reliability was very good (kappa = 1) in Ewing sarcoma and moderate (kappa = 0.6) in patients with osteomyelitis. A sharp and defined margin, optimally visualized on T1-weighted images in comparison to short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images, is the most significant feature of Ewing sarcoma in differentiating from osteomyelitis.

Despite the progress in diagnosis and treatment, sarcomas have a high mortality rate due to local recurrence, metastasis, and the development of drug resistance to chemotherapy. New models for sarcoma research are required to further understand the disease and to develop new therapies. In vitro sarcoma modeling is challenging because of significant genetic heterogeneities, diverse pathological, and overlapping clinical characteristics. Studies on the mechanisms of recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance in sarcoma have resulted in the generation of novel three-dimensional (3D) culture models for sarcoma research. 3D culture models aim to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of sarcoma using biomaterial scaffolds of natural biological materials and artificial polymers. An ideal 3D culture model can properly mimic not only the microenvironment, oncogenesis, and maintenance of sarcoma cell growth, but also imitate the interactions between cells and to the extracellular matrix. More recently, 3D cell culture has been used to research the biological behavior and mechanism of chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance in different sarcoma models. Ultimately, findings using 3D models that more accurately reflect human sarcoma biology are likely to translate into improved clinical outcomes. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances of 3D culture technologies in sarcoma research and emerging clinical applications.\n[Combinatorial Drug Screening Identifies Ewing Sarcoma-specific Sensitivities.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28062706)\nRadic-Sarikas, Branka; Tsafou, Kalliopi P; Emdal, Kristina B; Papamarkou, Theodore; Huber, Kilian V M; Mutz, Cornelia; Toretsky, Jeffrey A; Bennett, Keiryn L; Olsen, Jesper V; Brunak, S\u00f8ren; Kovar, Heinrich; Superti-Furga, Giulio\n2017-01-01\nImprovements in survival for Ewing sarcoma pediatric and adolescent patients have been modest over the past 20 years. Combinations of anticancer agents endure as an option to overcome resistance to single treatments caused by compensatory pathways. Moreover, combinations are thought to lessen any associated adverse side effects through reduced dosing, which is particularly important in childhood tumors. Using a parallel phenotypic combinatorial screening approach of cells derived from three pediatric tumor types, we identified Ewing sarcoma-specific interactions of a diverse set of targeted agents including approved drugs. We were able to retrieve highly synergistic drug combinations specific for Ewing sarcoma and identified signaling processes important for Ewing sarcoma cell proliferation determined by EWS-FLI1 We generated a molecular target profile of PKC412, a multikinase inhibitor with strong synergistic propensity in Ewing sarcoma, revealing its targets in critical Ewing sarcoma signaling routes. Using a multilevel experimental approach including quantitative phosphoproteomics, we analyzed the molecular rationale behind the disease-specific synergistic effect of simultaneous application of PKC412 and IGF1R inhibitors. The mechanism of the drug synergy between these inhibitors is different from the sum of the mechanisms of the single agents. The combination effectively inhibited pathway crosstalk and averted feedback loop repression, in EWS-FLI1-dependent manner.

Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of 6 cases, studied with CT and/or MRI in patients with retroperitoneal lipo sarcoma during the last 4 years at our institution. We analyzed symptoms, treatment and prognosis with special focus on the CT and MRI findings and their histological correlation. Results: the most frequent histological subtype in our group of patients was the pleomorphic lipo sarcoma (n=3). In the others cases, 2 were well differentiated and one was round-cell type. Retroperitoneal lipo sarcoma, especially the well differentiated, presented certain imaging patterns which allowed to suspect the subtype of tumor. Recurrences occurred in 50% (n=3). Mortality rate was 33.4% (n=2) (follow-up, 16 months). Conclusion: Both CT and MRI are methods which aid in the detection of this rare disorder, as well as in its diagnosis and follow-up.

Immunotherapies, including oncolytic viral (OV) therapy, have shown great promise in a number of clinical trials for a variety of tumor types. However, the effective application of OV in treating sarcoma still remains to be demonstrated. Although few pre-clinical studies using distinct OVs have been performed and demonstrated therapeutic benefit in sarcoma models, a side-by-side comparison of clinically relevant OV platforms has not been performed. Four clinically relevant OV platforms (Reovirus, Vaccinia virus, Herpes-simplex virus and Rhabdovirus) were screened for their ability to infect and kill human and canine sarcoma cell lines in vitro, and human sarcoma specimens ex vivo. In vivo treatment efficacy was tested in a murine model. The rhabdovirus MG1 demonstrated the highest potency in vitro. Ex vivo, MG1 productively infected more than 80% of human sarcoma tissues tested, and treatment in vivo led to a significant increase in long-lasting cures in sarcoma-bearing mice. Importantly, MG1 treatment induced the generation of memory immune response that provided protection against a subsequent tumor challenge. This study opens the door for the use of MG1-based oncolytic immunotherapy strategies as treatment for sarcoma or as a component of a combined therapy. \u00a9 2017 UICC.\n[Postradiation sarcoma of bone: review of 78 Mayo Clinic cases](http://www.etde.org/etdeweb/details.jsp?query_id=1&page=0&osti_id=5638235) [Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)](https://www.etde.org/etdeweb/fieldedsearch.jsp)\nWeatherby, R.P.; Dahlin, D.C.; Ivins, J.C.\n1981-05-01\nPostradiation sarcoma of bone is an uncommon but serious sequela of radiation therapy.

Although uncommon, these tumors are iatrogenic, and vaccination against rabies and feline leukemia virus is perhaps the most common inciting cause. The exact etiopathogenesis is unknown, but it is widely accepted that inflammation induced by vaccines or other injections likely plays a critical role in tumor development. Injection site sarcomas are extremely locally invasive. Multimodal therapy, incorporating combinations of surgery, radiation therapy, and sometimes chemotherapy or immunotherapy, is recommended. However, tumor recurrences are common even with aggressive treatment, and many cats with FISS ultimately succumb to this devastating disease. While vaccination protocols play an important role in the management and control of infectious disease, veterinarians must be diligent in following established vaccination guidelines to minimize individual patient risk of FISS development. Early tumor detection and client education are also vital in the successful treatment of FISS.

Five major molecular alterations are discussed, illustrated with representative sarcoma types, including 1. the presence of chimeric transcription factors, in vascular tumors; 2. abnormal kinase signaling, in gastrointestinal stromal tumor; 3. epigenetic deregulation, in chondrosarcoma, chondroblastoma, and other tumors; 4. deregulated cell survival and proliferation, due to focal copy number alterations, in dedifferentiated liposarcoma; 5. extreme genomic instability, in conventional osteosarcoma as a representative example of sarcomas with highly complex karyotype.

Prior studies evaluating sarcomas as second malignant neoplasms in breast cancer patients have been limited by the numbers of patients and relatively low incidence of sarcoma. Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registries, we evaluated the influence of radiation therapy on the development of subsequent sarcomas in cases with primary breast cancer. Methods: Cases with primary invasive breast cancer (n=274,572) were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Cancer Incidence Public-Use Database (1973-1997). The database was then queried to determine the cases developing subsequent sarcomas (n=263). Eighty-seven of these cases received radiation therapy, and 176 had no radiation therapy. The cumulative incidence of developing secondary sarcoma and the survival post developing secondary sarcoma were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The occurrence of sarcoma was low, regardless of whether cases received or did not receive radiation therapy: 3.2 per 1,000 (SE [standard error] = 0.4) and 2.3 per 1,000 (SE=0.2) cumulative incidence at 15 years post diagnosis, respectively (p=0.001). Of the sarcomas occurring within the field of radiation, angiosarcoma accounted for 56.8%, compared to only 5.7% of angiosarcomas occurring in cases not receiving radiotherapy. The cumulative incidence of angiosarcoma at 15 years post diagnosis was 0.9 per 1,000 for cases receiving radiation (SE=0.2) and 0.1 per 1,000 for cases not receiving radiation (SE<0.1). Overall survival was poor for cases of sarcoma after breast cancer (27-35% at 5 years), but not significantly different between patients receiving or not receiving radiation therapy for their primary breast cancer. Conclusions: Radiotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer is associated with an increased risk of subsequent sarcoma, but the magnitude of this risk is\n[Multiple skeletal muscle metastases revealing a cardiac intimal sarcoma](http://www.etde.org/etdeweb/details.jsp?query_id=1&page=0&osti_id=22674643) [Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)](https://www.etde.org/etdeweb/fieldedsearch.jsp)\nCrombe, Amandine [Institut Bergonie, Department of Radiology, Bordeaux (France); Lintingre, Pierre-Francois; Dallaudiere, Benjamin [Clinique du Sport de Bordeaux-Merignac, Department of Musculoskeletal Radiology, Merignac (France); Le Loarer, Francois [Institut Bergonie, Department of Pathology, Bordeaux (France); Lachatre, Denis [Dupuytren University Hospital, Department of Radiology, Limoges (France)\n2018-01-15\nWe report the case of a 59-year-old female with progressive bilateral painful swelling of the thighs. MRI revealed multiple intramuscular necrotic masses with similar morphologic patterns. Whole-body CT and 18-FDG PET-CT scans demonstrated additional hypermetabolic muscular masses and a lobulated lesion within the left atrial cavity. As biopsy of a muscular mass was compatible with a poorly differentiated sarcoma with MDM2 oncogene amplification, two diagnoses were discussed: a dedifferentiated liposarcoma with muscle and heart metastases or a primary cardiac sarcoma, mainly a cardiac intimal sarcoma, with muscular metastases, which was finally confirmed by array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in a sarcoma reference center. This case emphasizes the potential for intimal sarcoma to disseminate in skeletal muscle prior to any other organ and the need for a genomic approach in addition to classical radiopathologic analyses to distinguish primary from secondary locations facing simultaneous tumors of the heart and skeletal muscles with MDM2 amplification.

The predominant sites of metastasis include the lung (38%), bone (including the spine; 31%), and the bone marrow (11%). Metastasis of Ewing's sarcoma to the central nervous system (CNS) is relatively rare, and most of the previous reports have demonstrated involvement of the bony calvarium or brain parenchyma. We describe here the imaging findings of dural metastasis of Ewing's sarcoma, and these imaging findings have not been previously reported on in the medical literature. In conclusion, dural metastasis of Ewing's sarcoma is very rare and its imaging characteristics are similar to those of a primary tumor, which mimic the findings of a schwannoma or meningioma.

Alveolar soft part sarcoma is a rare sarcoma of an unclear cause. It is representing 0.2-1 percent of soft tissue sarcomas. Unique biologic behaviors of soft-tissue sarcomas features include formation of a reactive zone, intra-compartmental growth, and, rarely, the presence of skip metastases. Although the soft-tissue sarcomas have a unique morphology, biological behavior, and prognosis, they share biological characteristics and are treated in a similar fashion. The concept of limb-sparing surgery, or limb salvage, has gradually evolved over the past 25 years. Prior to this the basic principles of surgical oncology for the extremities consisted solely of determining the correct level at which to perform an amputation. The three stages of a limb-sparing procedure are as follows: tumor resection skeletal reconstruction and soft-tissue coverage and muscle transfers to restore function. Imaging diagnostic is a key step in the limp-sparing surgery of a soft tissue sarcomas at relation of: preoperatively - the diagnosis of lesion, the decision for biopsy, about location of the lesion and what is the safest anatomic route to that location, possibly lung and bone metastases; postoperative - checking the position of the prosthesis, inflammatory, mechanic and oncology complications.

Meanwhile, HDGF knock-down causes cell cycle arrest and enhanced sensitization to serum starvation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, recombinant HDGF promotes proliferation and colony formation of Ewing's sarcoma cells. Ninety-eight candidate HDGF downstream genes were identified in Ewing's sarcoma cells using cDNA microarray analysis. In addition, we found that HDGF knock-down inhibited FLI1 expression in Ewing's sarcoma cells at the mRNA and protein levels.

In this study, we investigated the preclinical activity of patient-derived cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells against autologous bone sarcoma and STS, including against putative sCSCs. Tumor killing was evaluated both in vitro and within an immunodeficient mouse model of autologous sarcoma. To identify putative sCSCs, autologous bone sarcoma and STS cells were engineered with a CSC detector vector encoding eGFP under the control of the human promoter for OCT4, a stem cell gene activated in putative sCSCs. Using CIK cells expanded from 21 patients, we found that CIK cells efficiently killed allogeneic and autologous sarcoma cells in vitro. Intravenous infusion of CIK cells delayed autologous tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. Further in vivo analyses established that CIK cells could infiltrate tumors and that tumor growth inhibition occurred without an enrichment of sCSCs relative to control-treated animals. These results provide preclinical proof-of-concept for an effective strategy to attack autologous sarcomas, including putative sCSCs, supporting the clinical development of CIK cells as a novel class of immunotherapy for use in settings of untreatable metastatic disease.\n[Diagnostic confusion resulting from CD56 expression by cutaneous myeloid sarcoma](http://www.pagepress.org/journals/index.php/rt/article/view/1242) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nSheeja T.

We report a case of myeloid sarcoma in a patient who presented with an ear lobe mass and facial nerve paralysis. Expression of CD56 by the malignant cells led to an initial misdiagnosis as Merkel cell tumor. Comprehensive pathological evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma with aberrant expression of CD56 and carrying the translocation t(8;21 (q22;q22. Aberrant antigen expression by cutaneous myeloid sarcomas can cause diagnostic confusion with other cutaneous neoplasms.

Within the abdomen, the tumour is usually localised within the retroperitoneum. Case OutlineWe present a 56-year-old woman in whom, during the routinely performed investigation for atacks of choking with lots of bronchial secretion, and arterial hypertension, an ultrasonographer found a tumour within the head of the pancreas 6\u00d76 cm in diameter. At operation, a dark pink, lobulated soft tumour, surrounded by a tiny capsule, clearly different from the completely normal pancreatic tissue of the posterior side of the head of the pancreas, was easily and ideally excised.The postoperative recovery was stormy. She developed postoperative pancreatitis, temporary biliary and duodenal fistula, which all settled by conservative treatment. The histology of the 80 g weighing tumour showed a circumscribed fibromyxoid sarcoma of low malignancy. Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse vimentin and CD34 strong positivity, as well as focal anti-SMA and anti-EMA immunopositivity. Six months after surgery, she died with signs of cerebrovascular insult, asthmatic status, and recurrent suppurative abdominal fistula, probably related to the previous pancreatitis. Ultrasonography showed a possible liver secondary. The exact cause of death was not confirmed as the autopsy was refused by the family. Conclusion Primary sarcomas of the pancreas are very rare, but should be considered in differential diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasms. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no previously described fibromyxoid sarcoma of the pancreas. .\n[Primary Occipital Ewing's Sarcoma with Subsequent Spinal Seeding.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28690908)\nAlqahtani, Ali; Amer, Roaa; Bakhsh, Eman\n2017-01-01\nEwing's sarcoma is a primary bone cancer that mainly affects the long bones. This malignancy is particularly common in pediatric patients. Primary cranial involvement accounts for 1% of cases, with occipital involvement considered extremely rare. In this case study, primary occipital Ewing's sarcoma with a posterior fossa mass and subsequent relapse resulting in spinal seeding is reported. A 3-year-old patient presented with a 1-year history of left-sided headaches, localized over the occipital bone with progressive torticollis. Computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a mass in the left posterior fossa compressing the brainstem. The patient then underwent surgical excision followed by adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. Two years later, the patient presented with severe lower back pain and urinary incontinence. Whole-spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seeding from the L5 to the S4 vertebrae. Primary cranial Ewing's sarcoma is considered in the differential diagnosis of children with extra-axial posterior fossa mass associated with destructive permeative bone lesions. Although primary cranial Ewing's sarcoma typically has good prognosis, our patient developed metastasis in the lower spine. Therefore, with CNS Ewing's sarcoma, screening of the entire neural axis should be taken into consideration for early detection of CSF seeding metastasis in order to decrease the associated morbidity and mortality.\n[Imaging of the most frequent superficial soft-tissue sarcomas](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00256-009-0855-y) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nMorel, Melanie; Taieb, Sophie; Ceugnart, Luc; Penel, Nicolas; Mortier, Laurent; Vanseymortier, Luc; Robin, Y.M.; Gosset, Pierre; Cotten, Anne\n2011-01-01\nSuperficial soft-tissue sarcomas are malignant mesenchymal tumors located within the cutaneous and/or subcutaneous layers.

For a period of 16 y (1984-2000), 34 children with Ewing's sarcoma were treated and followed in our department. Twenty-seven of these patients were without distant metastases. Complex treatment was applied to all these patients-chemotherapy VACA (vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin), local radiotherapy to a total dose of 50-56 Gy +/- surgery. After, a local tumour control was achieved in 11 children with non-metastatic Ewing's sarcoma, elective whole lung irradiation to a total dose of 12-15 Gy was applied. Our experience in these 11 patients with non-metastatic Ewing's sarcoma, in whom elective lung irradiation was applied, showed significant reduction in the lung metastases, improved free of disease survival and overall survival. The achieved good treatment results necessitate extending this treatment approach through defining the risk groups of patients, suitable for elective lung radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy in non-metastatic Ewing's sarcoma. \u00a9 The Author 2015.

Stefaniuk\n2012-01-01\nFull Text Available Introduction. Primary breast sarcomas (PBSs are rare nonepithelial breast tumors compromised of mesenchymal mammary tissue. Although its rare nature has made the best mode of PBS treatment difficult to determine, it seems better to treat it more like a sarcoma creating clear negative margins verses breast carcinoma utilizing lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, and total mastectomy. Case. A 47-year-old obese Caucasian postmenopausal female G2P2 presents with a breast lump demonstrating a histological sample with a biphasic pattern consistent with both ductal carcinoma containing typical malignant epithelial cells and sarcomatous differentiation of carcinosarcoma. Conclusion. Carcinosarcoma is a rare breast malignancy. Sarcomas of the breast tend to be negative for estrogen receptor and lack known risk factors. Current recommended treatment is to treat breast sarcomas like other soft tissue sarcomas by performing wide local excision instead of partial mastectomy. Antiestrogens and other chemotherapeutic agents typically used in breast epithelial malignancies are not recommended since these sarcomas tend to be negative with these receptors.\n[Regulatory roles and therapeutic potential of microRNA in sarcoma.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26318097)\nLim, Hui Jun; Yang, Jia-Lin\n2016-01-01\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded noncoding RNAs involved in various biological processes, including cell differentiation and development. They play multiple key roles as tumour suppressors, oncogenes or both in particular cases. This review aims to summarise current findings of the expression of miRNAs and their role in clinical oncology. Current knowledge regarding the involvement of miRNAs in different sarcoma subtypes will be assessed, in conjunction with their potential application as therapeutic targets. Relevant articles in scientific databases were identified using a combination of search terms, including \"microRNA,\" \"deregulation,\" \"sarcoma,\" and \"targeted therapy\". These databases included Medline, Embase, Cochrane Review, Pubmed and Scopus. Aberrant miRNA expression patterns have been identified in a range of sarcoma subtypes, and differences in miRNA expression profiles between malignant cells and their normal counterparts suggests that miRNAs play key roles in sarcoma development. The identification of unique miRNA patterns in individual tumour types could possibly be used as a diagnostic tool in sarcoma. Moreover, identification of these miRNAs provides novel targets for the development of therapeutic strategies in distinct sarcoma subtypes. miRNAs hold significant potential as diagnostic biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets in sarcoma. Possible future clinical applications include the use of miRNA pathways as therapeutic targets or miRNA expression profiling as a means of patient selection. The involvement miRNAs will undoubtedly contribute to the advancement of future targeted therapeutic interventions in sarcoma, and further establishment of appropriate delivery systems is vital for their use in clinical settings.

More effective therapies based on an increased understanding of the molecular biology of sarcomas are needed as current forms of therapy remain inadequate. Recently, it has been reported that Wnt-1/\u03b2-catenin signaling inhibits apoptosis in several cancers. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a monoclonal anti-Wnt-1 antibody in sarcoma cells. We treated cell lines A-204, SJSA-1, and fresh primary cultures of lung metastasis of sarcoma with a monoclonal anti-Wnt-1 antibody. Wnt-1 siRNA treatment was carried out in A-204. We assessed cell death using Crystal Violet staining. Apoptosis induction was estimated by flow cytometry analysis (Annexin V and PI staining). Cell signaling changes were determined by western blotting analysis. We detected Wnt-1 expression in all tissue samples and cell lines. Significant apoptosis induction was found in monoclonal anti-Wnt-1 antibody treated cells compared to control monoclonal antibody treated cells (p < 0.02). Similarly, we observed increased apoptosis in Wnt-1 siRNA treated cells. Blockade of Wnt-1 signaling in both experiments was confirmed by analyzing intracellular levels of Dishevelled-3 and of cytosolic \u03b2-catenin. Furthermore, the monoclonal anti-Wnt-1 antibody also induced cell death in fresh primary cultures of metastatic sarcoma in which Wnt-1 signaling was active. Our results indicate that Wnt-1 blockade by either monoclonal antibody or siRNA induces cell death in sarcoma cells. These data suggest that Wnt-1 may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of a subset of sarcoma cells in which Wnt-1/\u03b2-catenin signaling is active\n[Estudo ultraestrutural do colo uterino de ratas ooforectomizadas ap\u00f3s aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3leo de copa\u00edba](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0102-86502000000400003) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nBrito Nara Macedo Botelho\n2000-01-01\nFull Text Available Em virtude da extensa utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o emp\u00edrica do \u00f3leo de copa\u00edba em tratamentos ginecol\u00f3gicos, este trabalho visa realizar um estudo ultraestrutural do colo uterino de ratas ap\u00f3s aplica\u00e7\u00e3o deste \u00f3leo.

Retroperitoneal sarcomas are uncommon large malignant tumors. Methods. Forty-one consecutive patients with localized retroperitoneal sarcoma were retrospectively studied. Results. Median age was 58 years (range 20\u201391 years. Median tumor size was 17.5 cm (range 4\u201341 cm. Only 2 tumors were <5 cm. Most were liposarcoma (44% and high-grade (59%. 59% were stage 3 and the rest was stage 1. Median followup was 10 months (range 1\u2013106 months. Thirty-eight patients had an initial complete resection; 15 (37% developed recurrent sarcoma and 12 (80% had a second complete resection. Patients with an initial complete resection had a 5-year survival of 46%. For all patients, tumor grade affected overall survival (=.006. Complete surgical resection improved overall survival for high-grade tumors (=.03. Conclusions. Tumor grade/stage and complete surgical resection for high-grade tumors are important prognostic variables. Radiation therapy or chemotherapy had no significant impact on overall or recurrence-free survival. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with initial and locally recurrent retroperitoneal sarcoma.\n[Kaposi's Sarcoma Of The Lung: A Case Report.](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ecajs/article/viewFile/137253/126747) [African Journals Online (AJOL)](http://www.ajol.info/index.php)\nuser\n2004-12-02\nDec 2, 2004 ...

Here, we introduced a Ewing's sarcoma-associated genetic fusion of the genes encoding the RNA-binding protein EWS and the transcription factor ETS (EWS-ETS) into a fraction of cells enriched for osteochondrogenic progenitors derived from the embryonic superficial zone (eSZ) of long bones collected from late gestational murine embryos. EWS-ETS fusions efficiently induced Ewing's sarcoma-like small round cell sarcoma formation by these cells. Analysis of the eSZ revealed a fraction of a precursor cells that express growth/differentiation factor 5 (Gdf5), the transcription factor Erg, and parathyroid hormone-like hormone (Pthlh), and selection of the Pthlh-positive fraction alone further enhanced EWS-ETS-dependent tumor induction. Genes downstream of the EWS-ETS fusion protein were quite transcriptionally active in eSZ cells, especially in regions in which the chromatin structure of the ETS-responsive locus was open. Inhibition of \u03b2-catenin, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), or enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) suppressed cell growth in a murine model of Ewing's sarcoma, suggesting the utility of the current system as a preclinical model. These results indicate that eSZ cells are highly enriched in precursors to Ewing's sarcoma and provide clues to the histogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma in bone.\n[Detecci\u00f3n de virus papiloma humano en la prevenci\u00f3n del c\u00e1ncer c\u00e9rvico-uterino](http://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0025-76802013000800017&lng=en&tlng=en) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nMar\u00eda Alejandra Picconi\n2013-12-01\nFull Text Available El c\u00e1ncer c\u00e9rvico-uterino (CCU, que est\u00e1 fuertemente asociado a la infecci\u00f3n por virus papiloma humano de alto riesgo (VPH-AR, sigue siendo un problema de salud p\u00fablica en Latinoam\u00e9rica.

Malignant tumors of connective tissue or sarcomas account for approximately 1% of all cancer diagnoses in adults and around 15% of paediatric malignancies per annum. There exists no information on the alterations of oxidant/antioxidant status of sarcoma patients in literature. This study was aimed to determine the levels of oxidative stress and antioxidant defence in patients with primary bone and soft tissue sarcoma and to investigate if there exists any significant differences in these levels between both the sarcomas. The study cohort consisted of 94 subjects; 20 soft tissue sarcoma, 27 primary bone sarcoma and 47 healthy controls. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls were determined to assess their oxidative stress levels while antioxidant status was evaluated using catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), thiols and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Sarcoma patients showed significant increase in plasma and urinary MDA and serum protein carbonyl levels (p < 0.05) while significant decreases were noted in TEAC, thiols, CAT and SOD levels (p < 0.05). No significant difference in oxidative damage was noted between both the sarcomas (p > 0.05). In conclusion, an increase in oxidative stress and decrease in antioxidant status is observed in both primary bone and soft tissue sarcomas with a similar extent of damage. This study offers the basis for further work on whether the manipulation of redox balance in patients with sarcoma represents a useful approach in the design of future therapies for bone disease\n[Cyclin D1 and Ewing's sarcoma/PNET: A microarray analysis.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363896)\nFagone, Paolo; Nicoletti, Ferdinando; Salvatorelli, Lucia; Musumeci, Giuseppe; Magro, Gaetano\n2015-10-01\nRecent immunohistochemical analyses have showed that cyclin D1 is expressed in soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of childhood and adolescents, while it is undetectable in both embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. In the present paper, microarray analysis provided evidence of a significant upregulation of cyclin D1 in Ewing's sarcoma as compared to normal tissues. In addition, we confirmed our previous findings of a significant over-expression of cyclin D1 in Ewing sarcoma as compared to rhabdomyosarcoma. Bioinformatic analysis also allowed to identify some other genes, strongly correlated to cyclin D1, which, although not previously studied in pediatric tumors, could represent novel markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of Ewing's sarcoma/PNET. The data herein provided support not only the use of cyclin D1 as a diagnostic marker of Ewing sarcoma/PNET but also the possibility of using drugs targeting cyclin D1 as potential therapeutic strategies.

With current treatments, significant number of patients relapse and survival is poor for those with metastatic disease. As part of novel target discovery in Ewing's sarcoma, we applied RNAi mediated phenotypic profiling to identify kinase targets involved in growth and survival of Ewing's sarcoma cells. Four Ewing's sarcoma cell lines TC-32, TC-71, SK-ES-1 and RD-ES were tested in high throughput-RNAi screens using a siRNA library targeting 572 kinases. Knockdown of 25 siRNAs reduced the growth of all four Ewing's sarcoma cell lines in replicate screens. Of these, 16 siRNA were specific and reduced proliferation of Ewing's sarcoma cells as compared to normal fibroblasts. Secondary validation and preliminary mechanistic studies highlighted the kinases STK10 and TNK2 as having important roles in growth and survival of Ewing's sarcoma cells. Furthermore, knockdown of STK10 and TNK2 by siRNA showed increased apoptosis. In summary, RNAi-based phenotypic profiling proved to be a powerful gene target discovery strategy, leading to successful identification and validation of STK10 and TNK2 as two novel potential therapeutic targets for Ewing's sarcoma.\n[Primary Ewing\u2019s sarcoma of the spine: case report Sarcoma de Ewing prim\u00e1rio da coluna vertebral: relato de caso](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0004-282X2006000400026) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nLeandro I.

Because of biological heterogeneity, these tumors have variable sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy. Adequate local control through complete tumor removal is an important therapeutic goal. However, aggressive resection of tumors in the spinal column must be coupled with restoration of spinal column stability and minimization of neural deficits. The balance of these factors makes treatment of primary sarcomas of the spine challenging, and dictates an individual approach to treatment.

In the present study, F(ab')/sub 2/ fragment was compared with whole IgG and those labeled with In-111 as well as I-131 were used as a radiotracer for the scintigraphic imaging of tumors. IgC and F(ab')/sub 2/ were labeled with I-131 using chloramine-T method and injected into nude mice bearing human osteogenic sarcoma. Scintigrams at day 2 clearly delineated the site of tumors with almost no radioactivity in other organs with F(ab')/sub 2/, which yielded much better images than whole IgG. Tumor-to-blood ratio of 6.09-27.87 was obtained at day 2 using F(ab')/sub 2/, whereas it was 0.76-1.12 at day 2 and 2.05-3.27 at day 7 with IgG. I-131 labeled nonspecific F(ab')/sub 2/ or IgG resulted in no or very low tumor uptake with tumor-to-blood ratio of 0.94-1.18 at day 2 for F(ab')/sub 2/ and 0.67-0.76 at day 7 for IgG, respectively. In-111 labeled F(ab')/sub 2/ fragment of OST7, which was prepared using DTPA as a bifunctional chelate, also showed a high tumor accumulation with tumor-to-blood ratio of 11.67-17.54 at day 2, but higher background activity in the liver and kidney was observed than I-131 labeled one.

Purpose We report and analyze an uncommon pattern of a 'cold' lesion in Ewing's sarcoma on bone scan and its pathophysiologic significance. Case report A 15-year-old boy complaining of thigh pain. CT scan evoked Ewing's sarcoma or osteitis. MRI evoked chronic osteitis. Scintigraphy showed a fairly intense and heterogeneous uptake on the femoral lesion and no abnormal uptake elsewhere. Biopsy showed none pathologic pattern. Three months later, a second biopsy concluded to Ewing's sarcoma. Bone scan showed a larger lesion with peripheral intense uptake centered by enlarged 'cold' area in the left femoral diaphysis and no evident bone metastasis. The patient underwent chemotherapy and surgery. Three months later, bone scan showed extensive skeletal metastasis. Conclusion Ewing's sarcoma appears usually as an intense lesion on bone scan. Nevertheless, decreased radiopharmaceutical uptake or 'cold' lesion may be seen in aggressive Ewing's sarcoma with lytic tumor, growth of which is very rapid and bony reaction is minimal.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of selinexor in several preclinical models of various sarcoma subtypes. The efficacy of selinexor was investigated in vitro and in vivo using 17 cell lines and 9 sarcoma xenograft models including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), liposarcoma (LPS), leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, undifferentiated sarcomas, and alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). Most sarcoma cell lines were sensitive to selinexor with IC50s ranging from 28.8 nM to 218.2 nM (median: 66.1 nM). Selinexor suppressed sarcoma tumor xenograft growth, including models of ASPS that were resistant in vitro. In GIST cells with KIT mutations, selinexor induced G1- arrest without attenuation of phosphorylation of KIT, AKT, or MAPK, in contrast to imatinib. In LPS cell lines with MDM2 and CDK4 amplification, selinexor induced G1-arrest and apoptosis irrespective of p53 expression or mutation and irrespective of RB expression. Selinexor increased p53 and p21 expression at the protein but not RNA level, indicating a post-transcriptional effect. These results indicate that selinexor has potent in vitro and in vivo activity against a wide variety of sarcoma models by inducing G1-arrest independent of known molecular mechanisms in GIST and LPS. These studies further justify the exploration of selinexor in clinical trials targeting various sarcoma subtypes.\n[\u00bfPsicoterapia, farmacoterapia o tratamiento combinado?

Dermatomyositis preceded a definitive diagnosis of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma by six months, although in retrospect unrecognized lesions may have presented simultaneously. He was treated with prednisone and azathioprine, thus raising the possibility of the role of immunosuppression in promoting progression of the sarcoma. It is suggested that although the association between dermatomyositis and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma occurs rarely, dermatomyositis should be considered a paraneoplastic syndrome of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Further, the finding of cutaneous lesions of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma could predict gastrointestinal involvement when dermatomyositis and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma occur in the same patient.\n[Clear cell sarcoma of the abdominal wall with peritoneal sarcomatosis: CT features](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=30048202) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nSabate, J.M.; Fernandez, A.; Torrubia, S.; Villanueva, A.; Monill, J.M.\n1999-01-01\nClear cell sarcoma, also called malignant melanoma of soft parts, is an uncommon neoplasm that involves tendons or aponeuroses of the lower extremity.

All cases must have a history of irradiation and the second neoplasm must have arisen in the area of the radiation field. A latent period of several years must have elapsed after irradiation before clinical evidence of a second malignant neoplasm. Most important thing is that, all suspected cases must have been proved histologically. We have experienced 3 cases of radiation-induced sarcoma, they were 42-years-old man who developed an osteosarcoma of the lumbar spine at the field of postoperative irradiation for seminoma 7 years previously, 69-years-old woman who developed a malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the buttock at the field of radical radiation for uterine carcinoma 7 years previously and 59-years-old woman who developed an extraskeletal osteosarcoma of the abdominal wall at the field of postoperative irradiation for uterine sarcoma 7 years previously. The last case is very rare and only 8 cases of radiation-induced extraskeletal osteosarcoma have been reported. Since there has been a definite trend in the treatment of cancer toward employing radiation for more favorable cases, in addition to technical improvements in the administration of radiotherapy and more modern equipment, survival data may have been altered considerably in many malignant tumors. Accordingly, more radiation-induced tumors may be encountered in the future. The clinical presentation and histopathology of these radiation-induced sarcomas are presented with a review of the literature.

One type of malignant mesenchymal tumor is synovial sarcoma with unknown histogenesis, which occurs predominantly in the lower extremities of young adults. The head and neck region is a relatively rare location. There are few cases of malignant mesenchymal tumors with laryngeal localization in literature. Case Report: In this report, a new case in a 23-year-old man, which was referred with increasing hoarseness for eight months, and dysphagia, odynophagia, and dyspnea since nearly one year ago, is reported. Indirect laryngoscopy revealed a laryngeal submucosal mass. The patient was operated and the histopathological diagnosis of synovial sarcoma was confirmed by IHC (Immunohistochemisry. Conclusion: Synovial sarcoma occurs predominantly in the lower extremities of young adults. Because very few cases of laryngeal synovial sarcoma are reported, every new case will bring some new information about diagnosis and therapy. It is of utmost importance to get to know new aspects and therapeutical modalities of this rare tumor.\n[Cytogenetically confirmed primary Ewing's sarcoma of the pancreas.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28473430)\nGolhar, Ankush; Ray, Samrat; Haugk, Beate; Singhvi, Suresh Kumar\n2017-05-04\nEwing's sarcoma is a highly aggressive malignant tumour most commonly affecting long bones in children and adolescents. It is part of the Ewing's sarcoma family of tumours (ESFTs) that also include peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour and Askin's tumours. ESFTs share common cytogenetic aberrations, antigenic profiles and proto-oncogene expression with an overall similar clinical course. In 99% of ESFTs, genetic translocation with molecular fusion involves the EWSR1 gene on 22q12. Approximately 30% of ESFTs are extraosseous, most commonly occurring in the soft tissues of extremities, pelvis, retroperitoneum and chest wall. Primary presentation in solid organs is very rare but has been described in multiple sites including the pancreas. Accurate diagnosis of a Ewing's sarcoma in a solid organ is critical in facilitating correct treatment. We report the case of a 17-year-old girl with cytogenetically confirmed primary pancreatic Ewing's sarcoma and provide a brief review of the published literature. \u00a9 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Preclinical data suggest a dependence on insulin-like growth-factor signalling for sarcoma subtypes, including Ewing's sarcoma, and early reports show antitumour activity of IGF-1R-targeting drugs in these diseases. Between January, 2006, and August, 2008, patients with refractory, advanced sarcomas received figitumumab (20 mg/kg) in two single-stage expansion cohorts within a solid-tumour phase 1 trial. The first cohort (n=15) included patients with multiple sarcoma subtypes, age 18 years or older, and the second cohort (n=14) consisted of patients with refractory Ewing's sarcoma, age 9 years or older. The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of figitumumab. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic profiling and preliminary antitumour activity (best response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST]) in evaluable patients who received at least one dose of medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00474760. 29 patients, 16 of whom had Ewing's sarcoma, were enrolled and received a total of 177 cycles of treatment (median 2, mean 6.1, range 1-24). Grade 3 deep venous thrombosis, grade 3 back pain, and grade 3 vomiting were each noted once in individual patients; one patient had grade 3 increases in aspartate aminotransferase and gammaglutamyltransferase concentrations. This patient also had grade 4 increases in alanine aminotransferase concentrations. The only other grade 4 adverse event was raised concentrations of uric acid, noted in one patient. Pharmacokinetics were comparable between patients with sarcoma and those with other solid tumours. 28 patients were assessed for response; two patients, both with Ewing's sarcoma, had objective responses (one complete response and one partial response) and eight patients had disease stabilisation (six with Ewing's sarcoma, one with\n[Matrix metalloproteinase 1: role in sarcoma biology.](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2999525?pdf=render) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nMuhammad Umar Jawad\n2010-12-01\nFull Text Available In carcinomas stromal cells participate in cancer progression by producing proteases such as MMPs. The expression MMP1 is a prognostic factor in human chondrosarcoma, however the role in tumor progression is unknown. Laser capture microdissection and In Situ hybridization were used to determine cellular origin of MMP1 in human sarcomas. A xenogenic model of tumor progression was then used and mice were divided in two groups: each harboring either the control or a stably MMP1 silenced cell line. Animals were sacrificed; the neovascularization, primary tumor volumes, and metastatic burden were assessed. LCM and RNA-ISH analysis revealed MMP1 expression was predominantly localized to the tumor cells in all samples of sarcoma (p = 0.05. The percentage lung metastatic volume at 5 weeks (p = 0.08 and number of spontaneous deaths secondary to systemic tumor burden were lower in MMP1 silenced cell bearing mice. Interestingly, this group also demonstrated a larger primary tumor size (p<0.04 and increased angiogenesis (p<0.01. These findings were found to be consistent when experiment was repeated using a second independent MMP1 silencing sequence. Prior clinical trials employing MMP1 inhibitors failed because of a poor understanding of the role of MMPs in tumor progression. The current findings indicating tumor cell production of MMP1 by sarcoma cells is novel and highlights the fundamental differences in MMP biology between carcinomas and sarcomas. The results also emphasize the complex roles of MMP in tumor progression of sarcomas. Not only does metastasis seem to be affected by MMP1 silencing, but also local tumor growth and angiogenesis are affected inversely.\n[Microsatellites with Macro-Influence in Ewing Sarcoma](http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/3/3/444) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nStephen L. Lessnick\n2012-07-01\nFull Text Available Numerous molecular abnormalities contribute to the genetic derangements involved in tumorigenesis. Chromosomal translocations are a frequent source of these derangements, producing unique fusion proteins with novel oncogenic properties. EWS/ETS fusions in Ewing sarcoma are a prime example of this, resulting in potent chimeric oncoproteins with novel biological properties and a unique transcriptional signature essential for oncogenesis. Recent evidence demonstrates that EWS/FLI, the most common EWS/ETS fusion in Ewing sarcoma, upregulates gene expression using a GGAA microsatellite response element dispersed throughout the human genome. These GGAA microsatellites function as enhancer elements, are sites of epigenetic regulation and are necessary for EWS/FLI DNA binding and upregulation of principal oncogenic targets. An increasing number of GGAA motifs appear to substantially enhance EWS/FLI-mediated gene expression, which has compelling biological implications as these GGAA microsatellites are highly polymorphic within and between ethnically distinct populations. Historically regarded as junk DNA, this emerging evidence clearly demonstrates that microsatellite DNA plays an instrumental role in EWS/FLI-mediated transcriptional regulation and oncogenesis in Ewing sarcoma. This unprecedented role of GGAA microsatellite DNA in Ewing sarcoma provides a unique opportunity to expand our mechanistic understanding of how EWS/ETS fusions influence cancer susceptibility, prognosis and transcriptional regulation.\n[Congenital extraskeletal Ewing\u2032s sarcoma of chest wall - A rare case report](https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=doajarticles::4929350ad14a02b92e3ed234d177dbdd)\nBhagyalakshmi Atla; B Satya Vara Prasad; K Satya Sri; Geeta Vandana\n2011-01-01\nCongenital extraskeletal Ewing\u2032s sarcoma or peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor is an extremely uncommon and invariably fatal tumor.

While this diverse family of malignancies comprises over 100 histological subtypes and many molecular aberrations are prevalent within specific sarcomas, very few are therapeutically targeted. Instead of utilizing molecular signatures, first-line sarcoma treatment options are still limited to traditional surgery and chemotherapy, and many of the latter remain largely ineffective and are plagued by disease resistance. Currently, the mechanism of sarcoma oncogenesis remains largely unknown, thus necessitating a better understanding of pathogenesis. Although substantial progress has not occurred with molecularly targeted therapies over the past 30 years, increased knowledge about sarcoma biology could lead to new and more effective treatment strategies to move the field forward. Here, we discuss biological advances in the core molecular determinants in some of the most common soft-tissue sarcomas \u2013 liposarcoma, angiosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, and synovial sarcoma \u2013 with an emphasis on emerging genomic and molecular pathway targets and immunotherapeutic treatment strategies to combat this confounding disease.

NETSARC (netsarc.org) is a network of 26 reference sarcoma centers with specialized MDTB, funded by the French National Cancer Institute to improve the outcome of sarcoma patients. Since 2010, presentation to an MDTB and second pathological review are mandatory for sarcoma patients in France. Patients' characteristics and follow-up are collected in a database regularly monitored and updated. The management and survival of patients presented to these MDTB before versus after initial treatment were analyzed.

Compared to other sarcomas, Ewing tumors normally show a good response to radiotherapy. However, there are consistently tumors with a radioresistant phenotype, and the underlying mechanisms are not known in detail. Here we investigated the association between survivin protein expression and the radiosensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma in vitro. Material and methods: An siRNA-based knockdown approach was used to investigate the influence of survivin expression on cell proliferation, double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair, apoptosis and colony-forming ability in four Ewing's sarcoma cell lines with and without irradiation. Results: Survivin protein and mRNA were upregulated in all cell lines tested in a dose-dependent manner. As a result of survivin knockdown, STA-ET-1 cells showed reduced cell proliferation, an increased number of radiation-induced DSBs, and reduced repair. Apoptosis was increased by knockdown alone and increased further in combination with irradiation. Colony formation was significantly reduced by survivin knockdown in combination with irradiation. Conclusion: Survivin is a radiation-inducible protein in Ewing's sarcoma and its down-regulation sensitizes cells toward irradiation. Survivin knockdown in combination with radiation inhibits cell proliferation, repair, and colony formation significantly and increases apoptosis more than each single treatment alone. This might open new perspectives in the radiation treatment of Ewing's sarcoma.

Somatic mutation importance in the pathogenesis or disease progression of histiocytic sarcoma was largely unknown. To identify somatic mutations in histiocytic sarcoma, we studied 5 histiocytic sarcomas [3 female and 2 male patients; mean age 54.8 (20-72), anatomic sites include lymph node, uterus, and pleura] and matched normal tissues from each patient as germ line controls. Somatic mutations in 50 \"Hotspot\" oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were examined using next generation sequencing. Three (out of five) histiocytic sarcoma cases carried somatic mutations in BRAF. Among them, G464V [variant frequency (VF) of 43.6 %] and G466R (VF of 29.6 %) located at the P loop potentially interfere with the hydrophobic interaction between P and activating loops and ultimately activation of BRAF. Also detected was BRAF somatic mutation N581S (VF of 7.4 %), which was located at the catalytic loop of BRAF kinase domain: its role in modifying kinase activity was unclear. A similar mutational analysis was also performed on nine acute monocytic/monoblastic leukemia cases, which did not identify any BRAF somatic mutations. Our study detected several BRAF mutations in histiocytic sarcomas, which may be important in understanding the tumorigenesis of this rare neoplasm and providing mechanisms for potential therapeutical opportunities.\n[Survivin, a target to modulate the radiosensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23053158)\nGreve, B; Sheikh-Mounessi, F; Kemper, B; Ernst, I; G\u00f6tte, M; Eich, H T\n2012-11-01\nRadiotherapy constitutes an essential element in the multimodal therapy of Ewing's sarcoma.

Usually, treatment involves surgical removal of the tumor and/or radiation to kill the tumor cells. However, if sarcomas spread to other parts of the body, the treatment options are limited. Genetic studies have revealed several genetic changes that contribute to the formation of sarcomas. Many sarcomas have a mutation in a gene that encodes a protein called Ras....\n[Effectiveness of Vascular Markers (Immunohistochemical Stains) in Soft Tissue Sarcomas.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29690962)\nNaeem, Namra; Mushtaq, Sajid; Akhter, Noreen; Hussain, Mudassar; Hassan, Usman\n2018-05-01\nTo ascertain the effectiveness of IHC markers of vascular origin like CD31, CD34, FLI1 and ERG in vascular soft tissue sarcomas including angiosarcomas, Kaposi sarcomas, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and a non-vascular soft tissue sarcoma (Epithelioid sarcoma). Descriptive study. Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore, from 2011 to 2017. Diagnosed cases of angiosarcomas (n=48), epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (n=9), Kaposi sarcoma (n=9) and epithelioid sarcoma (n=20) were selected. Immunohistochemical staining as performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections. The sections were stained for the following markers: CD34 (VENTANA clone Q Bend 10), CD31 (Leica clone 1 A 10), FLI1 (CELL MARQUE clone MRQ-1) and ERG (CELL MARQUE clone EP111). A complete panel of CD34, CD31 and ERG was applied on 8/48 cases of angiosarcomas with triple positivity in 6 cases. Eight cases showed positivity for only CD31 and ERG and 2 cases showed positivity for only ERG. A complete panel of CD34, CD31 and ERG was applied on 3/9 cases of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma with positivity for all markers in 2 cases. Combined positivity for ERG and CD34 was seen in 2 cases and on 4 cases only CD31 immunohistochemical was solely applied with 100% positivity. FLI1 was not applied on any case. Among 9 cases of Kaposi sarcoma, ERG, CD34 and CD31 in combination were applied on only 1 case with triple positivity. Remaining cases show positivity for either CD34, CD31 or FLI1. Majority of cases of epithelioid sarcomas were diagnosed on the basis of cytokeratin and CD34 positivity with loss of INI1. The other vascular markers showed negativity in all cases. Among these four markers, ERG immunohistochemical stain is highly effective for endothelial differentiation due to its specific nuclear staining pattern in normal blood vessel endothelial cells (internal control) as well as neoplastic cells of vascular tumors and lack of background staining.\n[Ewing Sarcoma: Current Management and Future Approaches Through Collaboration](https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.amc.nl%3Apublications%2F0c85462e-6e1f-4579-a41a-d1272216adc4/uquery/ewing%27s%20AND%20sarcoma/id/20/Language/EN)\nGaspar, Nathalie; Hawkins, Douglas S.; Dirksen, Uta; Lewis, Ian J.; Ferrari, Stefano; Le Deley, Marie-Cecile; Kovar, Heinrich; Grimer, Robert; Whelan, Jeremy; Claude, Line; Delattre, Olivier; Paulussen, Michael; Picci, Piero; Sundby Hall, Kirsten; van den Berg, Hendrik; Ladenstein, Ruth; Michon, Jean; Hjorth, Lars; Judson, Ian; Luksch, Roberto; Bernstein, Mark L.; Marec-B\u00e9rard, Perrine; Brennan, Bernadette; Craft, Alan W.; Womer, Richard B.; Juergens, Heribert; Oberlin, Odile\n2015-01-01\nEwing sarcoma (ES) is an aggressive sarcoma of bone and soft tissue occurring at any age with a peak incidence in adolescents and young adults.

Of these patients, 6919 were followed for at least 1 year. Out of these, 11 presented with sarcomas thought to be induced by irradiation, 2 of which were Steward-Treves Syndrome, and 9 of which were sarcomas within the irradiated fields. All histological slides were reviewed and a comparison with those of breast cancer was done. The sites of these sarcomas were: parietal wall, 1 case; second costal cartilage, 1 case; infraclavicular region, 1 case; supraclavicular region, 2 cases; internal third of the clavicle, 2 cases; axillary region 2 cases; and the internal side of the upper arm (Stewart-Treves syndrome), 2 cases. The median age of these 11 patients at the diagnosis of sarcomas was 65.8 (49-83). The mean latent period was 9.5 years (4-24). Three patients underwent radical mastectomy and nine modified radical mastectomy. Only one patient received chemotherapy. The radiation doses received at the site of the sarcoma were 45 Gy/18 fr. for 10 cases and 90-100 Gy for 1 case (due to overlapping between two fields). The histology was as follows: malignant fibrous histiocytoma, 5 cases; fibrosarcoma, 3 cases; lymphangiosarcoma, 2 cases; and osteochondrosarcoma, 1 case. The median survival following diagnosis of sarcoma was 2.4 years (4 months-9 years). Two patients are still alive: one with recurrence of her breast cancer, the other in complete remission, with 7 and 3 years follow-up, respectively. All other patients died from their sarcomas. The cumulative incidence of sarcoma following irradiation of breast cancer was 0.2% (0.09-0.47) at 10 years. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of sarcoma (observed n number-sign of cases (Obs)/expected n number-sign of cases (Exp) computed from the Danish Cancer Registry for the same period) was 1.81 (CI 0.91-3.23)\n[Sarcomas in north west England: I.

This paper describes the effects of peer review. Material was reviewed by a panel of five pathologists for 413 of the 450 cases originally registered as sarcomas with the Regional Cancer Registry. The diagnosis of sarcomas was confirmed in 76% cases and and there was agreement on sub-type for 53% cases. Measures of agreement were lowest for the two sub-types most commonly diagnosed i.e. malignant fibrous histiocytoma and leiomyosarcoma. Degree of agreement between individual pathologists and final panel diagnosis was also very variable but never less than 65%. It is concluded that second opinion is essential in cases of presumed sarcomas for studies of incidence and aetiology and to ensure that appropriate treatment is selected.\n[Extraskeletal Ewing's Sarcoma: insight into a ten years follow-up.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24217837)\nZitelli, A; Manfredelli, S; Brunotti, G; Marcantonio, M; Pontone, S; Angelici, A\n2013-01-01\nExtraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma is a rare malignant soft tissue tumor, classified within the Ewing's Sarcoma Family Tumors. While the classical Ewing's Sarcoma affects mainly the bone during youth, the Extraskeletal histotype differs for age incidence, primary location and prognosis. Peak incidence and typical location are during adolescence and in the extremities respectively. We report a 30 year old woman case with a positive outcome after ten years from first diagnosis of Extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma. Treatment was achieved through surgical resection plus adjuvant chemoradiotherapy derived from EW93 and IRS III trials. Conclusion.

Surgical resection can offer hope of cure and patient outcomes are improved when patients are managed in high-volume specialist centers. Failure to recognize retroperitoneal sarcomas on imaging can lead to inappropriate management in inexperienced centers. Therefore it is critical that a diagnosis of retroperitoneal sarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a retroperitoneal mass with prompt referral to a soft tissue sarcoma unit. In particular, the most common retroperitoneal sarcoma subtypes, liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma, have characteristic imaging appearances which are discussed. This review therefore aims to set the context and guide clinicians through a diagnostic pathway for retroperitoneal masses in adults which arise extrinsic to the solid abdominal viscera.

Five patients with synovial sarcoma arising from the peripheral nerve and interpreted clinically and radiologically as peripheral nerve sheath tumors were identified. Clinicopathologic and imaging features were evaluated. There were three females and two males, ranging in age from 28 to 50 (mean 35.8) years. Most patients (4/5) complained of a mass, discomfort or pain. MR images demonstrated a heterogeneous, enhancing, soft tissue mass contiguous with the neurovascular bundle. On histologic examination, most tumors were monophasic synovial sarcoma (4/5). At the time of surgery, all tumors were noted to arise along or within a peripheral nerve. All patients were alive with no evidence of disease with median follow-up of 44 (range 32-237) months. For comparison, approximately 775 benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors of the extremities were identified during the same time period. Primary synovial sarcoma of the nerve can mimic peripheral nerve sheath tumors clinically and on imaging and should be included in the differential diagnosis for tumors arising from peripheral nerves.

Unfortunately, there is little progress in the treatment of metastatic soft tissue sarcomas in the past two decades beyond the standard approaches of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Immunotherapy is a modality complementary to conventional therapy,. It is appealing because functional anti-tumor activity could affect both local-regional and systemic disease and act over a prolonged period of time. In this report, we review immunotherapeutic investigative strategies being developed, including several tumor vaccine, antigen vaccine, and dendritic cell vaccine strategies.

These tumors are locally invasive and histologically aggressive. As with high-grade soft tissue sarcoma in humans, combination treatment with radiation therapy and surgery provides for optimum tumor control. Feline vaccine-associated sarcoma has become a difficult issue for the veterinary profession for legal, ethical, and clinical reasons. Although most research efforts have focused on therapeutic intervention, this tumor has great potential to provide an informative model for carcinogenesis and genetic susceptibility applicable to cancer in all species, including humans.\n[Endometrial stromal sarcoma diagnosed after uterine morcellation in laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20955991)\nDella Badia, Carl; Karini, Homa\n2010-01-01\nEndometrial stromal sarcoma is a rare uterine cancer with no reliable method for preoperative diagnosis. A 30-year-old parous woman underwent laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy because of a leiomyoma. The uterus was removed from the abdominal cavity with an electric morcellator with a spinning blade. The pathology report revealed low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. Two months after the initial surgery, a second laparoscopic procedure was performed. The final pathology report confirmed low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma involving the ovary, fallopian tube, and ovarian artery. It was concluded that morcellation of leiomyomas at laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy may potentially increase metastasis if the tumor is a sarcoma. Copyright \u00a9 2010 AAGL.

These cancers presented challenges in new drug development partly because of their rarity and heterogeneity. Many new molecular targeting drugs have been tried in the 2010s, and some were approved for bone and soft tissue sarcoma. As one of the first molecular targeted drugs approved for solid malignant tumors, imatinib\u2019s approval as a treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs has been a great achievement. Following imatinib, other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs have been approved for GISTs such as sunitinib and regorafenib, and pazopanib was approved for non-GIST soft tissue sarcomas.

This malignancy is particularly common in pediatric patients. Primary cranial involvement accounts for 1% of cases, with occipital involvement considered extremely rare. In this case study, primary occipital Ewing\u2019s sarcoma with a posterior fossa mass and subsequent relapse resulting in spinal seeding is reported. A 3-year-old patient presented with a 1-year history of left-sided headaches, localized over the occipital bone with progressive torticollis. Computed tomography (CT imaging showed a mass in the left posterior fossa compressing the brainstem. The patient then underwent surgical excision followed by adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. Two years later, the patient presented with severe lower back pain and urinary incontinence. Whole-spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI showed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF seeding from the L5 to the S4 vertebrae. Primary cranial Ewing\u2019s sarcoma is considered in the differential diagnosis of children with extra-axial posterior fossa mass associated with destructive permeative bone lesions. Although primary cranial Ewing\u2019s sarcoma typically has good prognosis, our patient developed metastasis in the lower spine. Therefore, with CNS Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, screening of the entire neural axis should be taken into consideration for early detection of CSF seeding metastasis in order to decrease the associated morbidity and mortality.\n[Giant primary synovial sarcoma of the anterior mediastinum: A case ...](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/njcp/article/viewFile/133488/123099) [African Journals Online (AJOL)](http://www.ajol.info/index.php)\n2015-06-11\nJun 11, 2015 ...

The current treatment of Ewing's sarcoma comprises systemic anti\u2011cancer chemotherapy with complete surgical resection. However, the majority of patients with Ewing's sarcoma develop resistance to chemotherapy. The present study revealed an oncogenic role of lactate dehydrogenase\u2011A (LDHA) in the resistance of Ewing's sarcoma to cetuximab. LDHA was shown to be upregulated at the protein and mRNA level in cetuximab\u2011resistant Ewing's sarcoma tissues and a cell line. In addition, a link between LDHA\u2011induced glycolysis and cetuximab resistance in Ewing's sarcoma cells was revealed. Of note, inhibition of LDHA by either small interfering RNA or LDHA inhibitor oxamate significantly re\u2011sensitized cetuximab\u2011resistant cells to cetuximab. Combined treatment with LDHA inhibitor and cetuximab synergistically reduced the viability of cetuximab-resistant cells through the suppression of LDHA. The present study revealed a novel mechanism of cetuximab resistance from the perspective of cancer\u2011cell metabolism and provided a sensitization approach, which may aid in the development of anti-chemoresistance strategies for the treatment of cetuximab-resistant Ewing's sarcoma.\n[Tratamiento Quir\u00fargico de las Esclerosis Faciales.](http://revistamedicina.net/ojsanm/index.php/Revistamedicina/article/view/365) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nRicardo Salazar L\u00f3pez\n2006-06-01\nEn este estudio se har\u00e1 una descripci\u00f3n del cuadro cl\u00ednico y evoluci\u00f3n de esta entidad, un an\u00e1lisis de su fisiopatolog\u00eda, una historia de la descripci\u00f3n y tratamiento de la misma, posteriormente se propone el tratamiento quir\u00fargico mediante colgajos musculares y se presentan varios casos cl\u00ednicos...\n[Extremity perfusion for sarcoma](https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.rug.nl%3Apublications%2Fff3b15bd-22b5-4727-834e-b1cade46b817/uquery/Discovery%20AND%20America/id/13/Language/EN)\nHoekstra, Harald Joan\n2008-01-01\nFor more than 50 years, the technique of extremity perfusion has been explored in the limb salvage treatment of local, recurrent, and multifocal sarcomas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors searched original research and review articles on specific aspects of human herpesvirus 8 infection, including virology, epidemiology, transmission, diagnosis, natural history, therapy, and Kaposi's sarcoma etiopathogenesis. The relevant material was evaluated and reviewed. RESULTS: Human herpesvirus 8 is a recently discovered DNA virus that is present throughout the world but with major geographic variation. In the Western world, the virus, transmitted mainly by means of sexual contact, is strongly associated with Kaposi's sarcoma and body cavity-based lymphoma and more controversially with multiple myeloma and other non-proliferative disorders. There is no specific effective treatment, but HIV protease inhibitors may play an indirect role in the clearance of human herpesvirus 8 DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-infected patients. Human herpesvirus 8 DNA is present in saliva, but there are as yet no documented cases of nosocomial transmission to health care workers. The prevalence of human herpesvirus 8 among health care workers is probably similar to that in the general population. CONCLUSION: Human herpesvirus 8 appears to be, at least in Western Europe and United States, restricted to a population at risk of developing Kaposi's sarcoma. Human herpesvirus 8 certainly has the means to overcome cellular control and immune responses and thus predispose carriers to malignancy, particularly Kaposi's sarcoma. The wide diffusion of Human herpesvirus 8 in classic Kaposi's sarcoma areas appears to represent an important factor in the high incidence of the disease. However, additional co-factors are likely to play a role in the development of Kaposi's sarcoma.OBJETIVO: O objetivo do presente artigo foi revisar a literatura recente em rela\n[Primary renal undifferentiated sarcoma as an infiltrative mass in a 12 year old boy](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=46131276) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nKim, Yong Hee; Kim, Myung Joon; Lee, Mi Jung; Kim, Se Hwa\n2015-01-01\nUndifferentiated sarcomas are rare tumors not classified into any sarcoma subtype.

Methods and Materials: Between January, 1995 and December, 1995, four patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) were treated with brachytherapy. Three patients, all with positive HIV status were treated using Iridium 192 (Ir-192) sources via a high-dose rate remote afterloader. One patient with endemic KS was treated using the application of catheters loaded with Californium 252. Eight sites were treated and included scalp, feet, nose, penis, hand, neck, and back. Dose rate for Ir-192 was 330cGy/fx to a total dose of 990cGy. The Californium was delivered as 100nGy/b.i.d. to a total dose of 900nGy. Follow-up as ranged from 2-6 months. Results: All four patients remain alive. Seven of eight sites have had complete clinical response and each patient has reported durable pain relief that has not subsided through last follow-up of 1/96. Two of eight sites, both treated with surface mold technique with Californium 252 developed moist desquamation. The remaining six sites did not demonstrate significant toxicity. Conclusion: Brachytherapy can offer Kaposi's sarcoma patients results that are equivalent to external beam radiation therapy, with minimal complications, a shorter treatment time and potential cost effectiveness\n[Discussing sarcoma risks during informed consent for nonhysterectomy management of fibroids: an unmet need.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28951264)\nSeagle, Brandon-Luke L; Alexander, Amy L; Strohl, Anna E; Shahabi, Shohreh\n2018-01-01\nThere is no reliable way to distinguish symptomatic uterine fibroids from sarcoma without a surgical specimen. Many women with a uterine sarcoma are initially managed without hysterectomy under a presumed fibroid diagnosis, without understanding sarcoma risks. Currently many alternatives to hysterectomy, including medical and procedural interventions, for treatment of fibroids are promoted. The sarcoma incidence among women with presumed fibroids is 0.29% (1/340) to 0.05% (1/2000). Nonmetastatic leiomyosarcoma has a 63% 5-year survival rate whereas metastatic leiomyosarcoma has a 14% 5-year survival rate. In uterine sarcoma, we often cannot identify who has sarcoma before making a potentially cure-denying decision by delaying surgery. Therefore, women electing an alternative to hysterectomy for fibroids should undergo an informed consent process that specifically includes discussion of uterine sarcoma incidence and mortality. Alternatives to hysterectomy for presumed fibroids remain preferable treatment options for many women with symptomatic fibroids, so long as underlying sarcoma risks are adequately discussed. The challenge for obstetrician- gynecologists then is how to provide better informed consent and maintain the primacy of patient autonomy over our concern to \"First, do no harm.\" Major threats to patient's autonomy are faced in the sarcoma risk discussion. How we should present sarcoma risk information to avoid being dismissive of sarcoma or frightening women toward hysterectomy is unstudied. Research is needed to determine how to provide sarcoma risk information with less bias during informed consent. Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Antunes\n2005-06-01\nFull Text Available Mesenchymal neoplasias represent 5% of tumors affecting the penis. Due to the rarity of such tumors, there is no agreement concerning the best method for staging and managing these patients. Sarcomas of the penis can be classified as deep-seated if they derive from the structures forming the spongy body and the cavernous bodies. Superficial lesions are usually low-grade and show a small tendency towards distant metastasis. In contrast, deep-seated lesions usually show behavior that is more aggressive and have poorer prognosis. The authors report 3 cases of deep-seated primary sarcomas of the penis and review the literature on this rare and aggressive neoplasia.\n[Intracranial Dural Metastasis of Ewing's Sarcoma: a Case Report](http://www.etde.org/etdeweb/details.jsp?query_id=1&page=0&osti_id=21019374) [Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)](https://www.etde.org/etdeweb/fieldedsearch.jsp)\nKim, Eung Yeop; Lee, Seung Koo; Kim, Dong Joon; Kim, Jin Na; Lee, Kyu Sung; Jung, Woo Hee; Kim, Dong Ik [Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul (Korea, Republic of)\n2008-02-15\nEwing's sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most commonly observed in the long bones of the arms and legs, the pelvis and in the chest. The predominant sites of metastasis include the lung (38%), bone (including the spine; 31%), and the bone marrow (11%). Metastasis of Ewing's sarcoma to the central nervous system (CNS) is relatively rare, and most of the previous reports have demonstrated involvement of the bony calvarium or brain parenchyma. We describe here the imaging findings of dural metastasis of Ewing's sarcoma, and these imaging findings have not been previously reported on in the medical literature. In conclusion, dural metastasis of Ewing's sarcoma is very rare and its imaging characteristics are similar to those of a primary tumor, which mimic the findings of a schwannoma or meningioma. Despite its rarity, secondary Ewing's sarcoma may be included in the differential diagnosis of extra-axial dural masses.\n[Primary pericranial Ewing's sarcoma on the temporal bone: A case report.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27308095)\nKawano, Hiroto; Nitta, Naoki; Ishida, Mitsuaki; Fukami, Tadateru; Nozaki, Kazuhiko\n2016-01-01\nPrimary Ewing's sarcoma originating in the pericranium is an extremely rare disease entity. A 9-year-old female patient was admitted to our department due to a left temporal subcutaneous mass. The mass was localized under the left temporal muscle and attached to the surface of the temporal bone. Head computed tomography revealed a mass with bony spicule formation on the temporal bone, however, it did not show bone destruction or intracranial invasion. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed no lesions other than the mass on the temporal bone. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the mass was located between the temporal bone and the pericranium. The mass was completely resected with the underlying temporal bone and the overlying deep layer of temporal muscle, and was diagnosed as primary Ewing's sarcoma. Because the tumor was located in the subpericranium, we created a new classification, \"pericranial Ewing's sarcoma,\" and diagnosed the present tumor as pericranial Ewing's sarcoma. We herein present an extremely rare case of primary pericranial Ewing's sarcoma that developed on the temporal bone.\n[Protective, elective lung irradiation in non-metastatic Ewing's sarcoma](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rpd/ncv076) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nMarinova, L.; Hristozova, I.; Mihaylova, I.; Perenovska, P.\n2015-01-01\nEwing's sarcoma in childhood is a disease from family of the peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumours. For a period of 16 y (1984-2000), 34 children with Ewing's sarcoma were treated and followed in our department. Twenty-seven of these patients were without distant metastases. Complex treatment was applied to all these patients-chemotherapy VACA (vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin), local radiotherapy to a total dose of 50-56 Gy \u00b1 surgery. After, a local tumour control was achieved in 11 children with non-metastatic Ewing's sarcoma, elective whole lung irradiation to a total dose of 12-15 Gy was applied. Our experience in these 11 patients with non-metastatic Ewing's sarcoma, in whom elective lung irradiation was applied, showed significant reduction in the lung metastases, improved free of disease survival and overall survival. The achieved good treatment results necessitate extending this treatment approach through defining the risk groups of patients, suitable for elective lung radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy in non-metastatic Ewing's sarcoma.

To evaluate the prognostic utility of NPM, we conducted an interactomic approach to characterize the NPM protein complex in Ewing's sarcoma cells. A gene suppression assay revealed that NPM promoted cell proliferation and the invasive properties of Ewing's sarcoma cells. FLAG-tag-based affinity purification coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified 106 proteins in the NPM protein complex. The functional classification suggested that the NPM complex participates in critical biological events, including ribosome biogenesis, regulation of transcription and translation, and protein folding, that are mediated by these proteins. In addition to JAK1, a candidate prognostic biomarker for Ewing's sarcoma, the NPM complex, includes 11 proteins known as prognostic biomarkers for other malignancies. Meta-analysis of gene expression profiles of 32 patients with Ewing's sarcoma revealed that 6 of 106 were significantly and independently associated with survival period. These observations suggest a functional role as well as prognostic value of these NPM complex proteins in Ewing's sarcoma. Further, our study suggests the potential applications of interactomics in conjunction with meta-analysis for biomarker discovery. \u00a9 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Studies revealed a 15-cm mass in the upper left lung, a 10-cm mass in the medial base of the left lung, and a 5-cm left atrial mass that involved the left lung, infiltrated the left pulmonary vein, and prolapsed into the mitral valve, causing intermittent obstruction. The patient underwent surgical excision of the left atrial tumor. Pathologic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of monophasic synovial sarcoma. To our knowledge, this is only the 3rd report of left atrial invasion and resultant mitral valve obstruction from a synovial sarcoma that infiltrated the pulmonary vein. We believe that this is the 1st documented case of a metastatic left atrial synovial sarcoma in monophasic form.

LBC samples of 10 cases of SS and 9 cases of ES/PNET were subjected to dc-CISH using probes for the specifically rearranged genes in each tumor entity: SYT in SS and EWS in ES/PNET. Rearranged SYT was successfully detected in all SSs but not in any ES/PNETs. In contrast, EWS rearrangement was identified in all ES/PNETs but not in any SSs. These results were validated by dc-fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. dc-CISH on LBC samples is a reliable modality to detect gene rearrangements in sarcomas. This system has a clear advantage over other methods, enabling simultaneous visualization of the genetic abnormality and well-preserved, nonoverlapping cytomorphologic features with clear background under bright-field microscope.\n[DR6 as a diagnostic and predictive biomarker in adult sarcoma.](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3342254?pdf=render) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nKun Yang\nFull Text Available The Death Receptor 6 (DR6 protein is elevated in the serum of ovarian cancer patients. We tested DR6 serum protein levels as a diagnostic/predictive biomarker in several epithelial tumors and sarcomas.DR6 gene expression profiles were screened in publically available arrays of solid tumors. A quantitative immunofluorescent western blot analysis was developed to test the serum of healthy controls and patients with sarcoma, uterine carcinosarcoma, bladder, liver, and pancreatic carcinomas. Change in DR6 serum levels was used to assay the ability of DR6 to predict the response to therapy of sarcoma patients.DR6 mRNA is highly expressed in all tumor types assayed. Western blot analysis of serum DR6 protein demonstrated high reproducibility (r = 0.97. Compared to healthy donor controls, DR6 serum levels were not elevated in patients with uterine carcinosarcoma, bladder, liver, or pancreatic cancers. Serum DR6 protein levels from adult sarcoma patients were significantly elevated (p<0.001. This was most evident for patients with synovial sarcoma. Change in serum DR6 levels during therapy correlated with clinical benefit from therapy (sensitivity 75%, and positive predictive value 87%.DR6 may be a clinically useful diagnostic and predictive serum biomarker for some adult sarcoma subtypes.Diagnosis of sarcoma can be difficult and can lead to improper management of these cancers. DR6 serum protein may be a tool to aid in the diagnosis of some sarcomatous tumors to improve treatment planning. For patients with advanced disease, rising DR6 levels predict non-response to therapy and may expedite therapeutic decision making and reduce reliance on radiologic imaging.\n[Assessing the reading level of online sarcoma patient education materials.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25566558)\nPatel, Shaan S; Sheppard, Evan D; Siegel, Herrick J; Ponce, Brent A\n2015-01-01\nCancer patients rely on patient education materials (PEMs) to gather information regarding their disease. Patients who are better informed about their illness have better health outcomes. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends that PEMs be written at a sixth- to seventh-grade reading level. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the readability of online PEMs of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas and related conditions. We identified relevant online PEMs from the following websites: American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, academic training centers, sarcoma specialists, Google search hits, Bonetumor.org, Sarcoma Alliance, Sarcoma Foundation of America, and Medscape. We used 10 different readability instruments to evaluate the reading level of each website's PEMs. In assessing 72 websites and 774 articles, we found that none of the websites had a mean readability score at or below 7 (seventh grade). Collectively, all websites had a mean readability score of 11.4, and the range of scores was grade level 8.9 to 15.5. None of the PEMs in this study of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas and related conditions met the NIH recommendation for PEM reading levels.

Low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma shows a wide anatomic distribution with a predilection for the head-and-neck region; however, intermediate- and high-grade myofibroblastic sarcomas in this localization are exceptional. Case Report: A 56-year-old woman with intermediate-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma of the base of tongue is presented. She was treated with surgical excision, but computed tomography proved local residual tumor. Reexcision and chemotherapy were refused by the patient. Irradiation was given to a total dose of 66 Gy. Result: 50 months after completion of radiotherapy, the patient is in good health without any evidence of disease. According to the review of the literature, base of tongue as the primary site of myofibroblastic sarcoma has not been published so far.

Facebook is the leading social media platform with more than 1 billion international daily users recorded in the summer of 2015. Facebook has a dynamic audience and is utilized in a number of ways, discussing medical issues being one of them. Ewing sarcoma mainly affects teenagers and young adults. Additionally, many individuals within this age group are regular users of Facebook. However, little is known about the impact of this modern way of communication via Web-based platforms on patients with Ewing sarcoma and their social environment. The aim of this study was to analyze and compare Ewing sarcoma patients' and relatives' behavior on Facebook to draw conclusions regarding the impact of Facebook on Ewing sarcoma treatment. We examined a Facebook group named \"Ewing Sarcoma Awareness\" that is used to exchange information for both patients and relatives regarding Ewing sarcoma. A self-designed questionnaire was used to compare patients' and relatives' answers. Additionally, we analyzed all processes (posts, likes, threads, links) in the group for 6 consecutive months. A total of 65 members of the Facebook group (26 patients, 39 relatives) out of 2227 international group members participated in our study.

It accounts for 4-9% of primary malignant bone tumors and it affects bones of the skull or face in only 1-4% of cases. Hence it rarely affects the head and neck. Subject and Method : In this case report, we describe a case of primary Ewing's sarcoma occurring in the temporal bone. The tumor was surgically excised, and the patient underwent chemotherapy for ten months. Results : Neither recurrence nor distant metastasis was noted in these 10 months after surgery but about 18 months after surgery our patient was expired. Conclusion : Although the prognosis of Ewing's sarcoma is generally poor because of early metastasis to the lungs and to other bones, a review of the article suggested that Ewing's sarcoma occurring in the skull can often be successfully managed by intensive therapy with radical excision and chemotherapy. This result was supported by the case reported here.\n[El tratamiento a largo plazo del trastorno bipolar](https://dspace.palermo.edu/ojs/index.php/psicodebate/article/view/350) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nLeonardo Tondo\n2015-07-01\nFull Text Available Las indicaciones medicamentosas para el tratamiento del trastorno bipolar (TB requieren de una ponderacio\u0301n de la necesidad de tratamiento del episodio en curso y su evolucio\u0301n a largo plazo.

Tumor types according to the World Health Organization classification include leiomyosarcoma, endometrial stroma sarcoma, and undifferentiated sarcoma. Staging is done using the 2014 Federation International Gynecology and Obstetrics and 2010 American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor, lymph node, and metastases systems. Tumor grade can be classified based on the French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group system or the Broder\u2019s system that incorporates tumor differentiation, mitotic count, and tumor necrosis. This review is a series of articles discussing uterine sarcoma, and this is Part I, which focuses on one of the subtypes of uterine sarcomas\u2014uterine leiomyosarcoma. The clinical characteristics, diagnosis, outcome, and recent advances are summarized in this article.\n[Development and potential applications of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology in sarcoma.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26806808)\nLiu, Tang; Shen, Jacson K; Li, Zhihong; Choy, Edwin; Hornicek, Francis J; Duan, Zhenfeng\n2016-04-01\nSarcomas include some of the most aggressive tumors and typically respond poorly to chemotherapy. In recent years, specific gene fusion/mutations and gene over-expression/activation have been shown to drive sarcoma pathogenesis and development. These emerging genomic alterations may provide targets for novel therapeutic strategies and have the potential to transform sarcoma patient care. The RNA-guided nuclease CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein-9 nuclease) is a convenient and versatile platform for site-specific genome editing and epigenome targeted modulation. Given that sarcoma is believed to develop as a result of genetic alterations in mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technologies hold extensive application potentials in sarcoma models and therapies. We review the development and mechanisms of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in genome editing and introduce its application in sarcoma research and potential therapy in clinic. Additionally, we propose future directions and discuss the challenges faced with these applications, providing concise and enlightening information for readers interested in this area.

Medical management is to a great extent undefined, and therefore for patients with regional and distal metastases, the development of targeted therapies is greatly desired. In this review we will summarize clinically-relevant biomarkers (e.g., SMARCB1, CA125, dysadherin and others with respect to targeted therapeutic opportunities. We will also examine the role of EGFR, mTOR and polykinase inhibitors (e.g., sunitinib in the management of local and disseminated disease. Towards building a consortium of pharmaceutical, academic and non-profit collaborators, we will discuss the state of resources for investigating epithelioid sarcoma with respect to cell line resources, tissue banks, and registries so that a roadmap can be developed towards effective biology-driven therapies.\n[Diagnosis and treatment of sarcomas and related tumors](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=10423388) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\n1978-01-01\nThe Cancergram focuses on clinical aspects of sarcomas involving soft tissue and bone, and also includes abstracts on related malignant and benign tumors.

The history, patterns of referral, diagnostic investigations, procedures undertaken and outcomes were studied. We found there was a frequent delay in diagnosis and sometimes misinterpretation of biopsy specimens. Patients were seen by a variety of specialists from disciplines such as general surgery, plastic surgery, orthopaedic surgery and rheumatology. Considerable progress has been made in the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas, often allowing local control of the tumour without amputation. We believe there should be early referral of patients having these tumours to a centre where a combined multidisciplinary approach can be undertaken.\n[Tratamiento especializado del abuso o dependencia del alcohol](http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=17031687008) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nJosep M.

Even after a comprehensive staging surgery or en block cytoreduction surgery followed by multimodality therapy (often chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, many patients relapse or present with distant metastases, and finally die of diseases. The worst outcome of uterine sarcomas is partly because of their rarity, unknown etiology, and highly divergent genetic aberration. Uterine sarcomas are often classified into four distinct subtypes, including uterine leiomyosarcoma, low-grade uterine endometrial stromal sarcoma, high-grade uterine endometrial stromal sarcoma, and undifferentiated uterine sarcoma. Currently, evidence from tumor biology found that these tumors showed alternation and/or mutation of genomes and the intracellular signal pathway. In addition, some preclinical studies showed promising results for targeting receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, various kinds of growth factor pathways, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, transforming growth factor \u03b2/bone morphogenetic protein signal pathway, aurora kinase A, MDM2 proto-oncogene, histone deacetylases, sex hormone receptors, certain types of oncoproteins, and/or loss of tumor suppressor genes.

Methods and Materials: From May 1997 to February 2006, 24 patients (17 male and 7 female) with unresectable retroperitoneal sarcoma received CIRT. Age ranged from 16 to 77 years (median, 48.6 years). Of the patients, 16 had primary disease and 8 recurrent disease. Histologic diagnoses were as follows: malignant fibrous histiocytoma in 6, liposarcoma in 3, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in 3, Ewing/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) in 2, and miscellaneous in 10 patients. The histologic grades were as follows: Grade 3 in 15, Grade 2-3 in 2, Grade 2 in 3, and unknown in 4. Clinical target volumes ranged between 57 cm 3 and 1,194 cm 3 (median 525 cm 3 ). The delivered carbon ion dose ranged from 52.8 to 73.6 GyE in 16 fixed fractions over 4 weeks. Results: The median follow-up was 36 months (range, 6-143 months). The overall survival rates at 2 and 5 years were 75% and 50%, respectively. The local control rates at 2 and 5 years were 77% and 69%. No complications of the gastrointestinal tract were encountered. No other toxicity greater than Grade 2 was observed. Conclusions: Use of CIRT is suggested to be effective and safe for retroperitoneal sarcomas. The results obtained with CIRT were a good overall survival rate and local control, notwithstanding the fact that most patients were not eligible for surgical resection and had high-grade sarcomas.\n[Late sarcoma development after curettage and bone grafting of benign bone tumors](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2010.06.053) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nPicci, Piero; Sieberova, Gabriela; Alberghini, Marco; Balladelli, Alba; Vanel, Daniel; Hogendoorn, Pancras C.W.; Mercuri, Mario\n2011-01-01\nBackground and aim: Rarely sarcomas develop in previous benign lesions, after a long term disease free interval. We report the experience on these rare cases observed at a single Institution. Patients and methods: 12 cases curetted and grafted, without radiotherapy developed sarcomas, between 1970 and 2005, 6.5-28 years from curettage (median 18, average 19). Age ranged from 13 to 55 years (median 30, average 32) at first diagnosis; tumors were located in the extremities (9 GCT, benign fibrous histiocytoma, ABC, and solitary bone cyst). Radiographic and clinic documentation, for the benign and malignant lesions, were available. Histology was available for 7 benign and all malignant lesions. Results: To fill cavities, autogenous bone was used in 4 cases, allograft in 2, allograft and tricalcium-phosphate/hydroxyapatite in 1, autogenous/allograft in 1, heterogenous in 1. For 3 cases the origin was not reported. Secondary sarcomas, all high grade, were 8 osteosarcoma, 3 malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and 1 fibrosarcoma. Conclusions: Recurrences with progression from benign tumors are possible, but the very long intervals here reported suggest a different cancerogenesis for these sarcomas. This condition is extremely rare accounting for only 0.26% of all malignant bone sarcomas treated in the years 1970-2005 and represents only 8.76% of all secondary bone sarcomas treated in the same years. This incidence is the same as that of sarcomas arising on fibrous dysplasia, and is lower than those arising on bone infarcts or on Paget's disease.

Clinical presentation is usually dominated by local pain and a palpable mass. These symptoms justify imaging investigations: the first one, when an osseous lesion is suspected, is usually a conventional radiograph in two planes. Ewing sarcoma appears as a poorly defined osteolytic lesion that may frequently be associated with cortical erosion or laminar periosteal response (\"onion skin\"). However, this aspect is not pathognomonic and the definitive diagnosis is made by biopsy. Absence of pain or an unusual localization can lead to misdiagnosis. We report the case of a 7-year-old boy with Ewing sarcoma located in the mandible with a clinical picture including progressive mandibular swelling but no pain.

Materials/methods: Fifty patients were identified retrospectively. All patients had MRI imaging pre and post neo-adjuvant external beam radiotherapy. Tumor volumes were measured in 3D on T1 Gadolinium enhanced sequences. Pathological treatment response was quantified in terms of percentage of treatment-related necrosis for each case. Results: Histopathologic responses to treatment varied from 0% to 100%. The median pathological treatment response was 67.5% for low-grade sarcomas and 50% for high-grade sarcomas. The median decrease in tumor volume was 13.8% for non-myxoid low-grade sarcomas, 82.1% for myxoid liposarcomas and <1% for high-grade sarcomas. A partial response on MRI (volume reduction \u2265 50%) was highly predictive of a good pathological response (p < 0.001). Patients with stable disease on imaging or volumetric progression had wide ranging pathological responses. Conclusions: Soft-tissue sarcomas show significant pathological treatment responses in the form of hyaline fibrosis, necrosis and granulation tissue. Despite this, there is minimal early volumetric response to radiation, especially for high-grade tumors. Although radiological partial response was predictive of pathological response, the significance of radiological progression was unclear. Myxoid liposarcoma tumor type was predictive of both pathological and radiological tumor response.\nJaber, Omar I; Kirby, Patricia A\n2015-11-01\nAlveolar soft part sarcoma is a rare neoplasm usually arising in the soft tissues of the lower limbs in adults and in the head and neck region in children. It presents primarily as a slowly growing mass or as metastatic disease. It is characterized by a specific chromosomal alteration, der(17)t(X:17)(p11:q25), resulting in fusion of the transcription factor E3 (TFE3) with alveolar soft part sarcoma critical region 1 (ASPSCR1) at 17q25. This translocation is diagnostically useful because the tumor nuclei are positive for TFE3 by immunohistochemistry. Real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect the ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion transcript on paraffin-embedded tissue blocks has been shown to be more sensitive and specific than detection of TFE3 by immunohistochemical stain. Cathepsin K is a relatively recent immunohistochemical stain that can aid in the diagnosis. The recent discovery of the role of the ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion protein in the MET proto-oncogene signaling pathway promoting angiogenesis and cell proliferation offers a promising targeted molecular therapy.\n[Tratamiento de aguas industriales mediante reactor biol\u00f3gico de membranas](https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=od_______912::fef55cf0d076196f3ac697de30de4e8b)\nAznar Jim\u00e9nez, Antonio\n2008-01-01\nEl Laboratorio de Ingenier\u00eda para el Tratamiento de Aguas de la Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, de investigaci\u00f3n y servicios en el tratamiento de aguas residuales, optimiza el dise\u00f1o y puesta a punto de reactores biol\u00f3gicos de membranas (MBR), indicados para obtener agua depurada de alta calidad y/o aumentar la capacidad de tratamiento.\n[Unusual Presentation of Postradiation Sarcoma With Subsequent Intestinal Metastasis Revealed by 18F-FDG PET/CT.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759523)\nLee, Tse-Hao; Chang, Cheng-Pei; Wu, Yuan-Hung; Huang, Wen-Sheng\n2017-10-01\nRadiation-related sarcoma is a rare but serious complication for patients after receiving radiation therapy initially for their primary malignancy.

We set out to retrospectively review the clinical and therapeutic demographics, as well as the cross-sectional imaging findings in patients with post-radiation sarcomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-three patients with post-radiation sarcomas were identified at a single institution. Computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging was available for all patients. The medical records were reviewed for the primary diagnoses, the radiation history, and the latency period to the development of the sarcoma. RESULTS: There were 43 women and 20 men with a mean age of 52.8 years. The mean radiation dose delivered was 50.1 Gy, with a mean latency period for the development of the sarcoma of 15.5 years. The most common primary diagnoses were breast cancer, lymphoma and head and neck cancer. The most common sarcoma histopathologies were osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The most common imaging findings were a soft tissue mass and bone destruction. CONCLUSIONS: Post-radiation sarcomas, while uncommon, are not rare. The imaging findings are not pathognomonic, but an appreciation of the expected latency period may help to suggest the diagnosis. Sheppard, D.G. and Libshitz, H.I.

MR images including DW images were obtained in 43 surgically treated patients with 58 myometrial tumors, including seven uterine sarcomas (five leiomyosarcomas and two endometrial stromal sarcomas) and 51 benign leiomyomas (43 ordinary leiomyomas, two cellular leiomyomas and six degenerated leiomyomas). Qualitative analysis of non-enhanced and postcontrast MR images and DW images and quantitative measurement of ADC values were performed for each myometrial tumor. Both uterine sarcomas and cellular leiomyomas exhibited high signal intensity on DW images, whereas ordinary leiomyomas and most degenerated leiomyomas showed low signal intensity. The mean ADC value (10 -3 mm 2 /s) of sarcomas was 1.17 \u00b1 0.15, which was lower than those of the normal myometrium (1.62 \u00b1 0.11) and degenerated leiomyomas (1.70 \u00b1 0.11) without any overlap; however, they were overlapped with those of ordinary leiomyomas and cellular leiomyomas. In addition to morphological features on nonenhanced and postcontrast MR sequences, DW imaging and ADC measurement may have a potential ability to differentiate uterine sarcomas from benign leiomyomas.

The SNPs were investigated in a healthy subject population and in Ewing's sarcoma patients from Southern Brazil. Genotyping was performed by TaqMan\u00ae assay for allelic discrimination using Real-Time PCR. The analysis of incidence of SNPs or different SNP-arrangements revealed a higher presence of homozygote TT-rs4820804 in Ewing's sarcoma patients (p=0.02; Chi Square Test). About 300 bp from the rs4820804 SNP lies a palindromic hexamer (5'-GCTAGC-3') and three nucleotides (GTC), which were previously identified to be in close vicinity of the breakpoint junction in both EWS and FLI1 genes. This DNA segment surrounding the rs4820804 SNP is likely to indicate a breakpoint region. If the T-rs4820804 allele predisposes a DNA fragment to breakage, homozygotes (TT-rs4820804) would have double the chance of having a chromosome break, increasing the chances for a translocation to occur. In conclusion, the TT-rs4820804 EWS genotype can be associated with Ewing's sarcoma and the SNP rs4820804 can be a candidate marker to understand Ewing's sarcoma susceptibility.

A 69-year-old woman underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection followed by linac therapy of 50 Gy delivered to the left axilla, left supraclavicular area, and parasternal area. During therapy for bone and liver metastases, a tumor was noted in the left chest wall 15 years after radiation therapy. Incisional biopsy was performed. Histological diagnosis was spindle cell sarcoma. Radiation-induced sarcoma was suspected because the tumor developed 15 years after radiation therapy within the same area. Radiation-induced sarcoma is a rare tumor, but radiation therapy following breast-conserving therapy is widely employed. It is important to be aware of the possibility of radiation-induced sarcoma.

Surgery offers the only aggressive approach to achieve a tumour-free state. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the outcome and survival of these patients at a single hepato-biliary university hospital. Between January 2004 and July 2013, 896 anatomical liver resections were performed. Eleven liver resections (1.2%) were performed due to primary hepatic sarcoma or hepatic sarcoma metastases. The demographic and clinical parameters were collected from the institutional patients' records. In eight patients (83%), liver resection was performed due to hepatic sarcoma metastases. The surgical procedures were as follows: two patients (18%) had segmentectomy, six patients (55%) had hemihepatectomy or extended hemihepatectomy and three patients (27%) had multivisceral resections. In nine patients (82%), the resection margins were tumour free. In 55% (n = 6) of the patients, the maximal tumour diameter was greater than 10 cm. The postoperative morbidity was low with a Clavien-Dindo score of 2 (range 0-5). One patient died on postoperative day 2 after multivisceral resection. During the follow-up of 932 days (range 2-2.220 days) the 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates were 91, 63 and 45%, respectively. Tumour recurrence was detected in seven patients (63%). Liver resections in patients with primary or secondary hepatic sarcoma are rare. The main goal in these patients is to achieve complete tumour resection because chemotherapy offers no suitable alternative, but the long-term survival rates are limited because of high a recurrence rate even after aggressive surgical approaches.\n[Imaging diagnosis of Granulocytic Sarcoma in the skull base](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=43076045) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nZheng Shaoyan; Xie Jiming; Yang Zhiyun; Zhou Zhou; Li Shurong\n2010-01-01\nObjective: To improve the understanding and imaging diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma in the skull base. Methods: Three cases of granulocytic sarcomas in the skull base are reported. The clinical features and imaging findings were analyzed. Results: The three cases occurred in children with acute myeloid leukemia. Two patients presented with oculomotor paralysis before the diagnosis of leukemia, the third patient with history of leukemia presented with headache. Diffuse infiltration of basal skull bone marrow and extracranial soft tissue masses were shown on MRI. The signal intensities of the masses were similar to that of gray matter on T 1 WI and T 2 WI with marked contrast enhancement. The soft tissue masses were located in the para-sellar region and surrounded the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus in one case. The soft tissue mass of the second case infiltrated the orbital cavity, cavernous sinus and oculomotor nerve. Tumor infiltrating the meninges, cranial nerves and paranasal sinuses was seen in the third patient. Conclusion: Cranial nerve paralysis can be the presenting symptom of basal skull granulocytic sarcoma in children. Granulocytic sarcoma should be considered in the different diagnosis when diffuse abnormal signal intensities in the basal skull bone marrow with solitary or multiple soft tissue masses are shown on MRI.

K.; Carvajal, R. D.\n2014-01-01\nSarcomas are heterogeneous malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin characterized by more than 100 distinct subtypes. Unfortunately, 25\u201350% of patients treated with initial curative intent will develop metastatic disease. In the metastatic setting, chemotherapy rarely leads to complete and durable responses; therefore, there is a dire need for more effective therapies. Exploring immunotherapeutic strategies may be warranted. In the past, agents that stimulate the immune system such as interferon and interleukin-2 have been explored and there has been evidence of some clinical activity in selected patients. In addition, many cancer vaccines have been explored with suggestion of benefit in some patients. Building on the advancements made in other solid tumors as well as a better understanding of cancer immunology provides hope for the development of new and exciting therapies in the treatment of sarcoma. There remains promise with immunologic checkpoint blockade antibodies. Further, building on the success of autologous cell transfer in hematologic malignancies, designing chimeric antigen receptors that target antigens that are over-expressed in sarcoma provides a great deal of optimism. Exploring these avenues has the potential to make immunotherapy a real therapeutic option in this orphan disease. PMID:24778572\n[[Association of Kaposi sarcoma--multiple myeloma.

Whatever its form, Kaposi's sarcoma is probably associated with a chronic viral human herpes type 8 infection (HHV8). This virus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (17 cases recorded to date). In the present study, a further case of Kaposi's sarcoma associated with multiple myeloma has been reported. However, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B and C, HIV and HHV8 serologies were negative. Radiotherapy on the lower limbs was initiated. It is concluded that HHV8 does not appear to play a pathogenic role in cases of multiple myeloma, given the rarity of the association between Kaposi's sarcoma/multiple myeloma/HHV8.\n[Bone and soft tissue sarcomas during pregnancy: A narrative review of the literature](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123216000047) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nGeorge Zarkavelis\n2016-07-01\nFull Text Available Bone or soft tissue sarcomas are rarely diagnosed during pregnancy.

However, exposure to ionizing radiation is a well-known risk factor for secondary cancer development. Currently, rigorous defined scientific criteria are lacking to establish if an individual tumor has a radiation-induced or a sporadic origin. The main aim of my thesis program was to identify a transcriptome signature of the ionizing radiation effects in radiation-induced cancers. The series of cancers used in this study is composed of sarcomas developing in the irradiation field of patients treated by radiotherapy for a primary cancer. Strict selection criteria (histology different from the primary cancer, latency longer than 5 years) were used to establish with a high probability the sarcomas-radiation induced origin. Their transcriptomes were compared with those from patients without irradiation history. A method of classification adapted to small series was used for the study of all the 60 collected sarcomas (34 radiation-induced and 26 sporadic). A learning set composed of 24 sarcomas from known aetiology allowed us to determine a signature of 135 genes discriminating the sarcomas according to their aetiology. The signature classified 86% of the remaining sarcomas as a function of their aetiology with an accuracy of 97%. The analysis of the genes-function shows that the radiation-induced sarcomas suffered the effects of a chronic oxidative stress mainly generated by mitochondrial dysfunctions. This study shows, for the first time, that it is possible to diagnose, at the case by case level, radiation-induced sarcomas on a rigorous scientific basis.

Ewing's sarcoma has retained the most unfavorable prognosis of all primary musculoskeletal tumors. Prior to the use of multi-drug chemotherapy, long-term survival was less than 10%. The development of multi-disciplinary therapy with chemotherapy, irradiation, and surgery has increased current long-term survival rates in most clinical centers to greater than 50%. In addition, the preferred method of tumor resection has changed; limb salvage has nearly replaced amputation of the affected limb. Limb salvage procedures can be performed in place of amputation without compromising patient survival rates. Recent studies have revealed that the pathognomonic translocations involving the EWS gene on chromosome 22 and an ETS-type gene, which is most commonly the Fli1 gene on chromosome 11, are implicated in more than 95% of Ewing's sarcomas, primitive neuroectodermal tumors and Askin's tumors. Therefore, these lesions have become regarded as a single entity, dubbed the Ewing's family of tumors. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect EWS-ETS gene arrangements is widely used to confirm the diagnosis of Ewing's family of tumors. Experimental results suggest that inhibition of the signaling pathway downstream of the EWS-ETS gene may lead to the development of molecularly targeted therapy in the future.

In contrast to ES, BCS shows consistent BCOR overexpression, and preliminary evidence suggests that these tumors share morphologic features with other tumors harboring BCOR genetic alterations, including BCOR internal tandem duplication (ITD) and BCOR-MAML3. To further investigate the pathologic features, clinical behavior, and their relationship to other round cell sarcomas, we collected 36 molecularly confirmed BCSs for a detailed histologic and immunohistochemical analysis. Four of the cases were also analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNAseq). An additional case with BCOR overexpression but negative CCNB3 abnormality showed a novel KMT2D-BCOR fusion by targeted RNAseq. The patients ranged in age from 2 to 44 years old (mean and median, 15), with striking male predominance (M:F=31:5). The tumor locations were slightly more common in bone (n=20) than soft tissue (n=14), with rare visceral (kidney, n=2) involvement. Histologically, BCS showed a spectrum of round to spindle cells with variable cellularity, monomorphic nuclei and fine chromatin pattern, delicate capillary network, and varying amounts of myxoid or collagenous stroma. The morphologic features and immunoprofile showed considerable overlap with other round cell sarcomas with BCOR oncogenic upregulation, that is, BCOR-MAML3 and BCOR ITD. Follow-up available in 22 patients showed a 5-year overall survival of 72%, which was relatively similar to ES (79%, P=0.738) and significantly better than CIC-DUX4 sarcomas (43%, P=0.005) control groups.

However, the majority of epigenetic studies of Ewing's sarcoma have focused on the analysis of only a few candidate genes. Comprehensive studies are thus lacking and are required. The aim of the present study was to identify novel methylation markers in Ewing's sarcoma using microarray analysis. The current study reports the microarray-based DNA methylation study of 1,505 CpG sites of 807 cancer-related genes from 69 Ewing's sarcoma samples. The Illumina GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I microarray was used, and with the appropriate controls (n=14), a total of 92 hypermethylated genes were identified in the Ewing's sarcoma samples. The majority of the hypermethylated genes were associated with cell adhesion, cell regulation, development and signal transduction. The overall methylation mean values were compared between patients who survived and those that did not. The overall methylation mean was significantly higher in the patients who did not survive (0.25\u00b10.03) than in those who did (0.22\u00b10.05) (P=0.0322). However, the overall methylation mean was not found to significantly correlate with age, gender or tumor location. GDF10 , OSM , APC and HOXA11 were the most significant differentially-methylated genes, however, their methylation levels were not found to significantly correlate with the survival rate. The DNA methylation profile of Ewing's sarcoma was characterized and 92 genes that were significantly hypermethylated were detected. A trend towards a more aggressive behavior was identified in the methylated group. The results of this study indicated that methylation may be significant in the development of Ewing's sarcoma.\n[Primary Intracranial Sarcoma Presenting as Chronic Subdural Fluid Collections in a Child.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26344638)\nGlenn, Chad A; Fung, Kar-Ming; Tullos, Hurtis J; McNall-Knapp, Rene Y; Gunda, Divya; Mapstone, Timothy B\n2016-02-01\nChronic subdural hematoma in the pediatric population often results from trauma. Asymptomatic and benign-appearing subdural collections are generally managed conservatively without operative intervention. Primary intracranial sarcomas are uncommon entities. Diagnosis of sarcoma can be difficult because these lesions often manifest as apparent hematoma. Presented is the case of a primary intracranial mucoid spindle cell sarcoma that arose in a child with a history of benign-appearing bilateral subdural fluid collections in the setting of nonaccidental trauma. The patient was initially managed conservatively because her neurological examination result was normal and her subdural collections decreased in size on repeated imaging. The collections did not resolve completely. Years later, she exhibited weakness, seizure, and an increase in the size of her subdural fluid collection. Subdural drainage was attempted without significant effect. Cytologic assessment of fluid was negative for malignant cells. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple enhancing masses along the subdural collection. The patient eventually underwent craniotomy in which a diagnosis of sarcoma was obtained. Pathological and radiographic findings as well as oncological management are reviewed. The authors also review the natural history and treatment of primary intracranial sarcoma in the pediatric population. Early contrasted magnetic resonance imaging should be obtained in patients with subdural fluid collections that appear asymmetric or do not resolve in the expected time course, despite having a normal neurologic examination result. Negative cytologic assessment does not exclude sarcoma diagnosis. Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, clinical research in sarcoma has lagged behind other cancers because of the multiple clinical and pathological entities that characterize sarcomas and their rarity. Sarcomas encompass a very heterogeneous group of tumors with diverse pathological and clinical overlapping characteristics. Molecular testing has been fundamental in the identification and better definition of more specific entities among this vast array of malignancies. A group of sarcomas are distinguished by specific molecular aberrations such as somatic mutations, intergene deletions, gene amplifications, reciprocal translocations, and complex karyotypes. These and other discoveries have led to a better understanding of the growth signals and the molecular pathways involved in the development of these tumors. These findings are leading to treatment strategies currently under intense investigation. Disruption of the growth signals is being targeted with antagonistic antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and inhibitors of several downstream molecules in diverse molecular pathways. Preliminary clinical trials, supported by solid basic research and strong preclinical evidence, promises a new era in the clinical management of these broad spectrum of malignant tumors.\n[Expression and prognostic value of lactate dehydrogenase-A and -D subunits in human uterine myoma and uterine sarcoma.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29620641)\nSong, Ke-Juan; Yu, Xiao-Ni; Lv, Teng; Chen, Yu-Long; Diao, Yu-Chao; Liu, Su-Li; Wang, Yan-Kui; Yao, Qin\n2018-04-01\nThis study aimed to determine the expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-A and LDH-D in patients with uterine myoma, cellular leiomyoma (CLM), and uterine sarcoma and to evaluate their prognostic significance. Protein expression levels of LDH-A and LDH-D were determined in tissue samples from 86 patients (26 uterine myoma, 10 CLM, 50 uterine sarcoma) by immunohistochemistry and their associations with clinicopathologic parameters and outcomes were analyzed in patients with uterine sarcoma. The positivity rates for LDH-A and LDH-D were significantly higher in patients with uterine sarcoma compared with those with uterine myoma or CLM (P sarcoma were classified as having uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS), malignant endometrial stromal sarcoma, and malignant mixed Mullerian tumor, with 5-year overall survival rates of 59%, 71%, and 29%, respectively (P sarcoma. Furthermore, the overexpressions of LDH-A and LDH-D in uterine sarcoma patients may contribute to further understanding of the mechanism of LDH in tumor metabolism in uterine sarcoma. Positive expression of LDH-A in patients with LMS may act as a potential prognostic biomarker in these patients.\n[Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with osteoclast-like giant cells of the female breast](http://www.wjso.com/content/11/1/21) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nBalbi Giancarlo\n2013-01-01\nFull Text Available Abstract The authors describe a case of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the breast occurring in a 50-year-old woman who presented with a palpable mass in her right breast. She first noticed the mass one month previously. Core needle biopsy showed connective tissue including epithelioid and spindle cells. The patient underwent total mastectomy without axillary lymph node dissection. Based on examination of the excised tumor, the initial pathologic diagnosis was atypical spindle-shaped and ovoid cells with uncertain malignant potential. Histological findings with immunomarkers led to the final diagnosis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. This case highlights a rare and interesting variant of primary breast sarcoma and the important role of immunohistochemistry in defining histological type and differential diagnosis. Hence, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma has been a diagnosis of exclusion performed through sampling and critical use of ancillary diagnostic techniques.\n[Histopathologic and Radiologic Assessment of Chemotherapeutic Response in Ewing's Sarcoma: A Review.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22550418)\nGarc\u00eda-Castellano, Jos\u00e9 M; Atallah Yordi, Nagib; Reyes, Carolina; Healey, John H\n2012-01-01\nEwing's sarcoma is a highly malignant tumor that metastasizes rapidly and is thus associated with a low survival rate. The intensification of chemotherapy has been shown to improve the overall survival of patients with Ewing's sarcoma. However, intensified chemotherapy can lead to increased toxicity or even the development of secondary malignancies. The stratification of patients with Ewing's sarcoma into \"good\" and \"poor\" responders may help guide the administration of progressively more intensified chemotherapy. Thus, an accurate assessment of the chemotherapeutic response, as well as the extent of chemotherapy-induced tumor necrosis, is critical for avoiding potential treatment-related complications in these patients. This paper reviews the methods currently used to evaluate chemotherapeutic response in Ewing's sarcoma, focusing specifically on histopathologic and imaging analyses, and discusses novel therapies and imaging methods that may help improve the overall survival of these patients.\n[Primary Vaginal Extraosseous Ewing Sarcoma/Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor with Cranial Metastasis](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1726490109703818) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nChi-Man Yip\n2009-06-01\nFull Text Available Extraosseous Ewing sarcoma is now regarded as a member of the Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET family. It typically involves the soft tissues of the chest wall, pelvis, paravertebral region, abdominal wall, retroperitoneal region and extremities of children, adolescents and young adults, but it seldom occurs in the female genital tract. We report an extremely rare case of retrospective diagnosis of vaginal extraosseous Ewing sarcoma/PNET which metastasized to the right frontoparietal scalp, skull, and dura. Surgical resection, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy resulted in a favourable clinical outcome. Both the vaginal and head tumors had similar light microscopic features supporting the diagnosis.\n[Second malignancies after treatment for Ewing's sarcoma: a report of the CESS-studies](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=35011648) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nDunst, Juergen; Ahrens, Susanne; Paulussen, Michael; Ruebe, Christian; Winkelmann, Wilfried; Zoubek, Andreas; Harms, Dieter; Juergens, Herbert\n1998-01-01\nPurpose: During recent years, more intensified systemic and local treatment regimens have increased the 5-year survival figures in localized Ewing's sarcoma to more than 60%. There is, however, concern about the risk of second malignancies (SM) in long-term survivors. We have analyzed the second malignancies in patients treated in the German Ewing's Sarcoma Studies CESS 81 and CESS 86. Materials and Methods: From January 1981 through June 1991, 674 patients were registered in the two sequential multicentric Ewing's sarcoma trials CESS 81 (recruitment period 1981-1985) and CESS 86 (1986-1991). The systemic treatment in both studies consisted of a four-drug-regimen (VACA = vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, and adriamycin; or VAIA = vincristine, actinomycin D, ifosfamide, and adriamycin) and a total number of four courses, each lasting nine weeks, was recommended by the protocol. Local therapy in curative patients was either complete surgery (n = 162), surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy with 36-46Gy (n 274), or definitive radiotherapy with 46-60Gy (n = 212). The median follow-up at the time of this analysis was 5.1 years, the maximum follow-up 16.5 years. Results: The overall survival of all patients including metastatic patients was 55% after 5 years, 48% after 10 years, and 37% after 15 years. Eight out of 674 patients (1.2%) developed a SM. Five of these were acute myelogenic leukemias (n = 4) or MDS (n = 1), and three were sarcomas. The interval between diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma and the diagnosis of the SM was 17-78 months for the four AMLs, 96 months for the MDS and 82-136 months for the three sarcomas. The cumulative risk of an SM was 0.7% after 5 years, 2.9% after 10 years, and 4.7% after 15 years. Out of five patients with AML/MDS, three died of rapid AML-progression, and two are living with disease. Local therapy (surgery vs. surgery plus postoperative irradiation vs. definitive radiotherapy) had no impact on the frequency of AML/MDS, but\n[Nuevas perspectivas para la prevenci\u00f3n del c\u00e1ncer de cuello uterino basadas en el virus del papiloma humano](https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=doajarticles::4cd1812dd3a0927334047e7b1b172968)\nNubia Mu\u00f1oz\n2006-01-01\nEl c\u00e1ncer de cuello uterino es el segundo m\u00e1s frecuente en mujeres y una de las causas m\u00e1s importantes de a\u00f1os perdidos de vida potencial, toda vez que afecta una gran proporci\u00f3n de mujeres j\u00f3venes y de edad media.

The ocular motility was severely impaired. Ophthalmological examination revealed markedly distended conjunctivas on both sides. Biopsy disclosed conjunctival granulocytic sarcoma as an initial symptom of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Diagnosis was confirmed by peripheral blood smear and bone marrow aspiration. Treatment and Outcome: The orbital tumor disappeared completely after local external beam irradiation with a total dose of 30 Gy and no further orbital recurrence occurred. With chemotherapy following irradiation transient hematological remission was achieved. 5 months after diagnosis the patient died of respiratory failure following atypical pneumonia as a consequence of her underlying disorder. Conclusion: Detection of orbital granulocytic sarcoma, even in the absence of typical leukemic symptoms is of practical importance, because treatment with irradiation can lead to stabilization or improvement in the patient's vision.

An 80 year-old man with a previous history of diffuse large B-cell malignant lymphoma presented with hematuria and back pain. Serial urine cytologies revealed no urothelial malignant cells, but cystoscopy showed a large intravesical mass. The patient underwent transurethral resection (TUR) of the tumor. The bladder TUR specimen showed a widely infiltrating epithelioid neoplasm, with intense immunohistochemical positivity for CD45 and histiocytic markers (CD68, lysozime and fascin). Histopathological diagnosis was histiocytic sarcoma. As the patient's condition was progressively deteriorating, only palliative care was indicated and he died one month after TUR. Although histiocytic sarcoma can often be widespread at the time of diagnosis, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a case presenting with urinary symptoms. Histiocytic sarcoma can mimic many other malignant lesions, and only immunohistochemistry can define the tumor cells, allowing correct therapy. We discuss the differential diagnosis and possible associations. Copyright \u00a9 2017 Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Anatom\u00eda Patol\u00f3gica. Publicado por Elsevier Espa\u00f1a, S.L.U.

To report and describe the MR imaging features of eight new cases of this rare soft tissue sarcoma and correlate them with the clinical and histologic findings.Design and patients. Retrospective analysis was carried out for the MR imaging characteristics and histologic findings of eight patients with pathologically proven epithelioid sarcoma and the literature was reviewed. Findings were correlated in each case with the patient's clinical presentation and eventual outcome.Results. The patients, whose primary tumors ranged from 2.5 cm to 19 cm in maximum dimension, were 1 to 90 years of age. Tumors involved the extremities (n=5), the scalp (n=2) and the paraspinal muscles (n=1). Five tumors presented as well-defined, frequently painful, deeply situated masses and three as subcutaneous nodules or cutaneous ulcers with no palpable mass. Four patients had associated regional lymphadenopathy and one had distant metastases at diagnosis. MR imaging showed tumor infiltration of adjacent tissues in seven patients. Signal characteristics reflected varying degrees of cellularity, and the presence of necrosis, hemorrhage, fibrosis, hyalinization and inflammation. Bone marrow involvement was demonstrated in one patient. Clinical outcomes were generally poor.Conclusions. Epithelioid sarcoma is an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma with a varied clinical presentation, growth pattern, MR signal characteristics and histologic picture. The tumor favors the distal extremities and is commonly infiltrative and accompanied by enlarged regional lymph nodes. This neoplasm may present as an intramuscular mass but should also be suspected in patients with ulcerating cutaneous nodules with or without regional lymphadenopathy.

Garc\u00eda-Castellano\n2012-01-01\nFull Text Available Ewing\u2019s sarcoma is a highly malignant tumor that metastasizes rapidly and is thus associated with a low survival rate. The intensification of chemotherapy has been shown to improve the overall survival of patients with Ewing\u2019s sarcoma. However, intensified chemotherapy can lead to increased toxicity or even the development of secondary malignancies. The stratification of patients with Ewing\u2019s sarcoma into \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cpoor\u201d responders may help guide the administration of progressively more intensified chemotherapy. Thus, an accurate assessment of the chemotherapeutic response, as well as the extent of chemotherapy-induced tumor necrosis, is critical for avoiding potential treatment-related complications in these patients. This paper reviews the methods currently used to evaluate chemotherapeutic response in Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, focusing specifically on histopathologic and imaging analyses, and discusses novel therapies and imaging methods that may help improve the overall survival of these patients.\n[A rare case of synovial sarcoma of the prostate | Dhabalia | African ...](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/aju/article/view/50215) [African Journals Online (AJOL)](http://www.ajol.info/index.php)\nProstatic synovial sarcomas are exceedingly rare.

P.\n2018-01-01\nEwing sarcoma is an undifferentiated small-round-cell sarcoma. Although molecular detection of pathognomonic EWSR1-ETS fusions such as EWSR1-FLI1 enables definitive diagnosis, substantial confusion can arise if molecular diagnostics are unavailable. Diagnosis based on the conventional immunohistochemical marker CD99 is unreliable due to its abundant expression in morphological mimics. To identify novel diagnostic immunohistochemical markers for Ewing sarcoma, we performed comparative expression analyses in 768 tumors representing 21 entities including Ewing-like sarcomas, which confirmed that CIC-DUX4-, BCOR-CCNB3-, EWSR1-NFATc2-, and EWSR1-ETS-translocated sarcomas are distinct entities, and revealed that ATP1A1, BCL11B, and GLG1 constitute specific markers for Ewing sarcoma. Their high expression was validated by immunohistochemistry and proved to depend on EWSR1-FLI1-binding to highly active proximal super-enhancers. Automated cut-off-finding and combination-testing in a tissue-microarray comprising 174 samples demonstrated that detection of high BCL11B and/or GLG1 expression is sufficient to reach 96% specificity for Ewing sarcoma. While 88% of tested Ewing-like sarcomas displayed strong CD99-immunoreactivity, none displayed combined strong BCL11B- and GLG1-immunoreactivity. Collectively, we show that ATP1A1, BCL11B, and GLG1 are EWSR1-FLI1 targets, of which BCL11B and GLG1 offer a fast, simple, and cost-efficient way to diagnose Ewing sarcoma by immunohistochemistry. These markers may significantly reduce the number of misdiagnosed patients, and thus improve patient care.

This family of tumors is usually seen in osseous sites. Ewing's sarcoma of the cervix is extremely rare, with only 18 cases reported in the English literature. The immunohistochemical profile of Ewing's sarcoma overlaps with other malignancies like small cell carcinoma. The rarity and complex pathologic picture of Ewing's sarcoma of the cervix creates the potential for misdiagnosis. Hence, we believe this case needs to be reported to add to the available literature. A 49-year-old white Caucasian woman presented with vaginal bleeding. A pelvic examination revealed a cystic lesion arising from her cervix. Examination of a biopsy specimen revealed a poorly differentiated neoplasm, with sheets of small hyperchromatic cells, staining weakly for neuroendocrine markers. She was diagnosed with small cell carcinoma and started on concurrent chemotherapy and radiation. However, additional positive immunostaining for CD99 was strongly suggestive of Ewing's sarcoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed ESWR1 gene rearrangement, confirming Ewing's sarcoma. Our patient underwent surgery, which confirmed stage IIB Ewing's sarcoma. She received adjuvant chemotherapy but died from progressive metastatic disease after four cycles. With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, Ewing's sarcoma of the cervix can be a potentially curable disease. However, owing to overlapping clinical and histopathological features, the diagnosis poses a challenge to oncologists and pathologists. This article guides pathologists to consider Ewing's sarcoma in the differential diagnosis of small cell carcinoma with weak staining for neuroendocrine markers. This literature review will benefit oncologists encountering this rare entity.\n[Exatecan in pretreated adult patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma: results of a phase II--study of the EORTC Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group](http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/33732987) [DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nReichardt, P; Nielsen, Ole Steen; Bauer, S\n2007-01-01\nNo standard treatment is established for patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma after previous chemotherapy with anthracyclines and ifosfamide, given either in combination or sequentially.

Only 27 cases of primary CNS histiocytic sarcoma have been reported. The paucity of literature on this entity has made diagnosis and treatment difficult both for the surgeon and the pathologist. In this case of primary CNS histiocytic sarcoma, a middle-aged woman presented from an outside institution with a supposed cerebellar abscess. Intraoperative frozen pathology was initially interpreted as high-grade glioma; however, final pathology demonstrated histiocytic sarcoma.

These MRI findings often prompt an orthopedic oncology referral, a biopsy or surgery. However, not all masses with these imaging findings are malignant. We report the multimodality imaging findings of two surgically proven chronic expanding hematomas (CEH) with imaging features that mimicked sarcomas. A third case of nonenhancing CEH of the lower extremity is also presented as a comparison. It is important that in the correct clinical scenario with typical imaging findings, the differential diagnosis of a chronic expanding hematoma be included in the workup of these patients. An image-guided biopsy of nodular tissue within such masses that proves to be negative for malignancy should not necessarily be considered discordant. A correct diagnosis may prevent a morbid unnecessary surgery and may indicate the need for a conservative noninvasive follow-up with imaging.\n[Fine-needle aspiration cytology of postirradiation sarcomas, including angiosarcoma, with immunocytochemical confirmation](http://www.etde.org/etdeweb/details.jsp?query_id=1&page=0&osti_id=5224421) [Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)](https://www.etde.org/etdeweb/fieldedsearch.jsp)\nSilverman, J.F.; Lannin, D.L.; Larkin, E.W.; Feldman, P.; Frable, W.J.

The recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) classification is a well-established prognostic scale used in many malignancies. In this study we assessed the clinical characteristics of metastatic sarcoma to the brain and the validity of the RPA classification system in a subset of 21 patients who underwent surgical resection of metastatic sarcoma to the brain We retrospectively analyzed the medical, radiological, surgical, pathological, and follow-up clinical records of 21 patients who were operated for metastatic sarcoma to the brain between 1996 and 2012. Gliosarcomas, sarcomas of the head and neck with local extension into the brain, and metastatic sarcomas to the spine were excluded from this reported series. The patients' mean age was 49.6 \u00b1 14.2 years (range, 25-75 years) at the time of diagnosis. Sixteen patients had a known history of systemic sarcoma, mostly in the extremities, and had previously received systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy for their primary tumor. The mean maximal tumor diameter in the brain was 4.9 \u00b1 1.7 cm (range 1.7-7.2 cm). The group's median preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale was 80, with 14 patients presenting with Karnofsky Performance Scale of 70 or greater. The median overall survival was 7 months (range 0.2-204 months). The median survival time stratified by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group RPA classes were 31, 7, and 2 months for RPA class I, II, and III, respectively (P = 0.0001). This analysis is the first to support the prognostic utility of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group RPA classification for sarcoma brain metastases and may be used as a treatment guideline tool in this rare disease.

Genetic and epigenetic evidences link aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling to growth and progression of human sarcomas. This phenomenon, mainly accomplished by autocrine loop activity, is sustained by gene amplification, over-expression of Wnt ligands and co-receptors or epigenetic silencing of endogenous Wnt antagonists. We previously showed that pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling mediated by Axin stabilization produced in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity in glioblastoma tumors. Here, we report that targeting different sarcoma cell lines with the Wnt inhibitor/Axin stabilizer SEN461 produces a less transformed phenotype, as supported by modulation of anchorage-independent growth in vitro. At the molecular level, SEN461 treatment enhanced the stability of the scaffold protein Axin1, a key negative regulator of the Wnt signaling with tumor suppressor function, resulting in downstream effects coherent with inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling. Genetic phenocopy of small molecule Axin stabilization, through Axin1 over-expression, coherently resulted in strong impairment of soft-agar growth. Importantly, sarcoma growth inhibition through pharmacological Axin stabilization was also observed in a xenograft model in vivo in female CD-1 nude mice. Our findings suggest the usefulness of Wnt inhibitors with Axin stabilization activity as a potentialyl clinical relevant strategy for certain types of sarcomas.", "language": null, "image": null,
