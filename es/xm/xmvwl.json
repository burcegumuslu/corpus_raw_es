Along with vaccines for healthcare workers providing direct care for COVID-19 patients, these vaccinations are part of the Phase 1A vaccine prioritization plan put in place by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to help protect those who are at greatest risk of the virus.\n\u201cWe are hopeful that the vaccine will eventually restore some sense of normalcy for the residents, staff, and their families,\u201d said Stacy Farman, lead LTCF epidemiologist for Boulder County Public Health. \u201cEven with the vaccine, measures like PPE use and COVID screenings will still take place until the community rate of COVID transmission is lower.\u201d\nFarman stated that Long-Term Care Facilities have been greatly impacted as the measures necessary to protect residents have resulted in isolation from family and friends.\nOnce facility residents and workers receive the first dose of the vaccine, they are scheduled to receive the second dose in three or four weeks, depending on the type of vaccine. There will be an ongoing process to vaccinate new staff and residents.\n\u201cFeedback from facilities has been positive and the vaccine roll out has been smooth,\u201d Farman said. \u201cSlowing transmission of the virus will still depend on community members doing their part. Getting the vaccine is one measure, but social distancing and mask wearing in the community will still be important if families and friends are allowed to safely visit.\u201d\nDifferent measures are already in place to stop the spread of COVID-19 in LTCF. All staff and residents are screened daily for COVID-19 symptoms or potential exposure. Anyone who exhibits symptoms or may have been exposed to the virus is excluded from work or placed in special precautions to prevent spread to other residents or staff. Depending on the transmission rate in the county, staff and residents who left the facility are tested for COVID-19 weekly or bi-weekly to identify asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers. Currently, test results are received within 24 to 36 hours.\nResidentes y personal de Instalaciones de Cuidado a Largo Plazo locales reciben vacuna contra COVID-19\nCondado de Boulder, CO- El 2 de enero, los residentes y personal de Instalaciones de Cuidado a Largo Plazo, como asilos para adultos mayores e instalaciones de enfermer\u00eda especializada, en el Condado de Boulder comenzaron a recibir vacunas contra COVID-19 a trav\u00e9s de la\n[Asociaci\u00f3n de Farmacias para el Programa de Cuidado a Largo Plazo,](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/long-term-care/pharmacy-partnerships.html) una asociaci\u00f3n entre centros de atenci\u00f3n, Centros para el Control y Prevenci\u00f3n de Enfermedades, y farmacias CVS y Walgreens. Junto con las vacunas para los trabajadores de la salud que brindan atenci\u00f3n directa a los pacientes con COVID-19, estas vacunas forman parte del plan de priorizaci\u00f3n de vacunas de la fase 1A puesto en marcha por el Departamento de Salud P\u00fablica y Medio Ambiente de Colorado para ayudar a proteger a quienes est\u00e1n en mayor riesgo de padecer del virus.\n\"Tenemos la esperanza de que la vacuna eventualmente restablezca cierto sentido de normalidad para los residentes, el personal y sus familias\", dijo Stacy Farman, epidemi\u00f3loga principal de Instalaciones de Cuidado a Largo Plazo para Salud P\u00fablica del Condado de Boulder. \"Incluso con la vacuna, medidas como el uso de EPI y monitoreos para COVID se llevar\u00e1n a cabo hasta que la tasa de transmisi\u00f3n de COVID baje\".\nFarman afirm\u00f3 que las Instalaciones de Cuidado a Largo Plazo se han visto muy afectadas, ya que las medidas necesarias para proteger a los residentes han dado lugar a un aislamiento de familiares y amigos.\nUna vez que los residentes y los trabajadores de las instalaciones reciban la primera dosis de la vacuna, se programara para recibir la segunda dosis en tres o cuatro semanas, dependiendo del tipo de vacuna. Habr\u00e1 un proceso continuo para vacunar al nuevo personal y a los residentes.\n\"Los comentarios de las instalaciones han sido positivos y el despliegue de la vacuna ha sido met\u00f3dico\", dijo Farman. \"Disminuir la transmisi\u00f3n del virus seguir\u00e1 dependiendo en que los miembros de la comunidad hagan su parte. Ponerse la vacuna es una medida de prevenci\u00f3n, pero el distanciamiento social y el uso de cubrebocas en la comunidad seguir\u00e1n siendo importantes si se permite que las familias y los amigos se visiten de forma segura\".\nYa existen diferentes medidas para detener la propagaci\u00f3n de COVID-19 en Instalaciones de Cuidado a Largo Plazo. Todo el personal y los residentes son examinados diariamente para detectar s\u00edntomas o exposici\u00f3n a COVID-19. Cualquier persona que presente s\u00edntomas o que haya estado expuesta al virus est\u00e1 excluida del trabajo o colocada en precauciones especiales para evitar la propagaci\u00f3n a otros residentes o personal. Dependiendo de la tasa de transmisi\u00f3n en el condado, el personal y los residentes, que abandonaron las instalaciones, son examinados para COVID-19 semanal o quincenalmente para identificar portadores asintom\u00e1ticos o presintom\u00e1ticos. Actualmente, los resultados de las pruebas se reciben en un plazo de 24 a 36 horas.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://maps.boco.solutions/propertysearch/",
