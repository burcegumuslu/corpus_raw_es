I don\u2019t love the price, or the fact that the scent doesn\u2019t last long on me. I also bought Alt Crystal NO.23 to give it a try. It smells just like the original, lasts all day on my skin, and I won\u2019t even discuss the difference in price. I am a believer. I do recommend Alt Crystal NO.23 (Highly.)\nI own the real fragrance and let me say that this perfume is exactly the same and stays longer on my skin too. Loved! I will definitely purchase another bottle.\nThis perfume is spot on. I\u2019m always asked if I\u2019m wearing baccarat rouge 540. I even went into their store in Miami and wasn\u2019t questioned if what I was wearing was a \u201cdupe\u201d VERY pleased. Will purchase again\nI went to my local SAKS fifth to smell MFK Baccarat 540. To my surprise I could not tell a difference between ALT Crystal No 23 and MFK. I will definitely purchase again.\nWherever I go, wherever I am - I ALWAYS get complimented on what fragrance I am wearing. I have samples of the actual MFK, and let me tell you the absolute truth.... I get more compliments on \"Crystal\" than I do with the MFK original. \"Crystal\" has the same aroma, depth, and pleasantness as the MFK original. I have been stopped by both men and women alike and asked \"What are you wearing?\" because you smell amazing. I am so happy with \"Crystal\" and OBVIOUSLY so is everyone else. The scent actually sells itself and is definitely WORTH every penny!! LOVE IT!!\nMy friend has the the authentic Baccarat and this smells identical. It is not quite as long lasting as the original but at 1/10 the price that is not a big issue. It really smells amazing!\nBeautiful scent\nThis perfume smells amazing, I just wish the scent was stronger\nAmazing smell but product could last longer. It seems to fade after an hour\nCrystal smells amazing definetly a dupe for baccarat rouge 540, the only downfall is that it doesn\u2019t last :(\nCustomer Reviews\n[Write a review](#)\nI have the Baccarat Rouge 540, I love this perfume.
