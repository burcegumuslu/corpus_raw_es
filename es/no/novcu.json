The Outlook is Stable. A list of additional rating actions is provided at the end of the commentary.\nThe ratings incorporate the established brand name \u201cMicrotek\u201d under which Himachal sells its products and the Microtek Group\u2019s pan-India distribution network.\nThe ratings also reflect Himachal\u2019s low leverage (net debt/EBITDA: 0.04x in FY11 (financial year ending March)), conservative financing policies and strong EBITDA margins (FY11: 31.3%) compared with its industry peers. The latter is due to a competitive cost structure, attributed to efficient procurement practices, in-house manufacturing of components and backward integration into copper-enamelled wire manufacturing.", "language": null, "image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/global-gateway.html", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/login.html", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216467423-Contact-Reuters", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us", "https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/companyNews", "//www.reuters.com/tools/mobile", "//newslink.reuters.com/join/subscribe", "//sales.reuters.com/en/ ", "//www.reuters.com/advertising-guidelines", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#cookies", "//www.reuters.com/terms-of-use", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "javascript:window.OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();", "https://www.reuters.com/info/disclaimer", "https://thomsonreuters.com/copyright/"]}
