For as long as I can remember, I was always marveled by the body\u2019s own natural mechanisms to reestablish health providing the right conditions and adequate resources were made available for the body to carry out the most formidable task a human organism can do, heal itself! The highest, most sophisticated gift of nature any organism possesses by far, understanding at every step of the way that nature has its rules and when these guidelines are violated, troubled health conditions take over as an understandable consequence. Our jobs as complimentary health therapists is to understand these laws of nature to help the immune system and all physiological processes reach the much sought balance or homeostasis.\nWithin the core values of our institution, NAAT, without a doubt <> \u2013 or \u201cFirst, do no harm\u201d is the most basic principle that directs our actions as complementary therapists, by choosing the most ecological protocols to correct health imbalances, wether they are from biological, psychogenic, or energetic origin, and restore health in a way that no harm is done.\nLet\u2019s as a group then, pursue the highest standards in safeguarding health, establishing meaningful relationships with those that trust their health conditions to us, where communication can flow freely to better assess results and adjust and improve protocols and approaches as a form of growth towards excellence and patient centered, results oriented delivery of the art and science of alternative, complementary, and integrative medicine healing systems.\nArmando J. Benavides, N.D.\nNAAT President\nHouston Texas\nInformation and Awareness to Promote Empowerment.\nWithin our mission statement we highlight the empowerment of individuals and groups of interest to make responsible, informed, and educated decisions over their own health conditions. Through education and an organized sharing of information relevant to the procurement of health, NAAT turns over to the individual the responsibility of his/her state of health, and exercising his inalienable right to be healthy, an undeniable birthright granted by nature and not by the institutions, and although our position is not against the institutionalized medical system as we believe in the complementation of all healing expressions depending on the individual\u2019s needs, we pronounce ourselves pro-choice and encourage medical freedom practices.\nThe Biological, Psico-emotional, and Bioenergetic Constituents of Health.\nThe professional team conforming NAAT considers the individual as a whole and understands that an imbalance at any of the different dimensions of the biological body, mind, and energetic components interacting with one another at different capacities can deeply affect the delicate equilibrium of health at a holistic level. Bringing a troubled state of health to homeostasis can be a monumental task when we consider how modern day lifestyles overburden our psyche, in addition to that the unavailability of good quality nutrients for healthy diet requirements, and the challenges of necessary lifestyle changes to protect and improve our health and promote healthy emotional states.\nInstruction, Delivery, and Granting of Degrees by NAAT.\nNAAT provides a clearinghouse of educational services, instructors, and academic bodies for a wide range of complementary healing modalities. We also deliver professional development, learning experiences, and academic services in the form of continuing education courses, workshops, diploma programs, associate degrees, therapist certifications, bachelor\u2019s degrees, and master\u2019s degrees in diverse areas of alternative, complementary, and integrative medicine.\nEndorsements of Courses Offered by Other Than NAAT Parties\nOur educational consultants with extensive experience in educational psychology, methodology, didactics, pedagogy, and course design and development, can assess your educational programs to ensure completeness, formality, and the academic rigor needed in a sound syllabus. Syllabus assessment of courses facilitated by individuals and institutions other than NAAT, are necessary before any endorsement is considered.
