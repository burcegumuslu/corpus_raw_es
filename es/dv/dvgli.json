By eliminating toxins in the body, one can restore the body to health. In view of the increasingly polluted environment and damaging lifestyle choices, this is becoming a model more and more noteworthy and significant.\nHomotoxicology is an extension of classic homeopathy. According to this therapeutic model, the type and severity of an illness are determined by the duration and intensity of toxin loading in relationship to the body?s inherent capacity for detoxification. The resulting disturbances, which eventually manifest as illness, are the body?s attempt to restore a state of biochemical balance. For Reckeweg, restoring this balance was the ultimate goal of all medical treatment.\nAfter a general introduction to bioregular medicine, the authors describe possible disease developments and introduce practical instruments for the daily practice by means of the Disease Evolution Table (DET). The following two chapters discuss the different preparation groups and the theory and practice of anti-homotoxic treatment. The book closes with a chapter on using anti-homotoxica in combination with complementary therapies, such as neural therapy and electro-acupuncture.\nAuthor:\n- Alta Smit , MD - Medical Director International, Heel Laboratories, Germany (Author)\n- Arturo O'Byrne , MD - Head of Clinic, Centro de Medicina Biol\u00f3gica, Cali, Colombia (Author)\n- Bruno Van Brandt - Manager International Medical Education, Heel Pharmaceutical, Baden-Baden, Germany (Author)\n- Ivo Bianchi , MD - President, Italian Society of Homotoxicology, Verona, Italy (Author)\n- Klaus Kuestermann , MD - President, International Association for Biomedicine,\nBaden-Baden, Germany (Author)\n[Tel 91 593 99 99](tel:003491 593 99 99)\nFax 91 448 21 88\n[Dir](/contacto)\nC/ Artesanos, 46\nC/ Artesanos, 46\nParque Empresarial Prado del Espino\n28660 Boadilla del Monte\nMadrid\n[Mailinfo@axon.es](mailto:info@axon.es)\n\u00a9 2023 Ax\u00f3n Librer\u00eda S.L.\n2.87.2", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["/", null, "/resultados/tags/libros/medicina natural | medicina integrativa", "tel:003491 593 99 99", "/contacto", "mailto:info@axon.es", "/privacidad", "/condiciones", "/quienes-somos", "/aviso-legal", "/contacto", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/axon-libreria", "https://www.pinterest.es/axonlibreria/", "https://twitter.com/axonlibreria", "https://www.facebook.com/libreriaaxon"]}
