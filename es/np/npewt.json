MoSi is a promising material in the \ufb01eld of quantum optics\napliccations, due to its amorphous structure and low energy gap, compared to conven-\ntional crystalline NbN. We characterize the superconducting properties of the detector,\n\ufb01nding a superconducting critical temperature of Tc= 4:98Kand a critical current\nat 0 K ofIc(0) = 30:91\u0016A. The I-V curves of this MoSi nanodetector are similar\nto those of similar devices fabricated in NbN. We also present experimental results on\nthe photon counting properties of the device, achieving a maximum count rate of 6\nMHz, with a relative low dark count rate. At the base temperature of T= 3:35K, the\ncritical current of the nanodetector was Ic= 6\u0016A. The count rate shows qualitative\ndifferences compared to other works with MoSi single photon detectors, but this re-\nsult is not conclusive. Lastly, we present a modi\ufb01ed Quantum Detector Tomography\nprotocol to obtain the intrinsic response of this detector, as well as two experimental\nsetup improvements that enhance the implementation of Quantum Detector Tomog-\nraphy. Understanding the properties and detection mechanism of superconducting\nnanowiresingle photon detectors (SNSPD\u2019s) will contribute to the development of new\ntechnologies.\nResumen\nCaracterizamos las propiedades de un detector de foton \u00b4unico de nanocable superconductor fabri-\ncado en MoSi, un material superconductor amorfo.

Introducci \u00b4on\nLa detecci \u00b4on de luz ha sido un tema de gran inter \u00b4es en la f \u00b4\u0131sica del \u00b4ultimo siglo, siendo una\nherramienta necesaria a la hora de medir propiedades de sistemas muy diversos. Detectar\nluz con precisi \u00b4on y \ufb01abilidad es de suma importancia en aplicaciones de caracter cient \u00b4\u0131\ufb01co\n(obtener mejores instrumentos de medida) y de car \u00b4acter tecnol \u00b4ogico, con una gran var-\niedad de sensores y aparatos que hoy aparecen en nuestro vida cotidiana. Hoy en d \u00b4\u0131a, el\nreto es detectar luz en su expresi \u00b4on fundamental, el fot \u00b4on o cuanto de la radiaci \u00b4on electro-\nmagn \u00b4etica. Un fot \u00b4on es un sistema puramente cu \u00b4antico por lo que este desaf \u00b4\u0131o cae dentro\ndel campo de la \u00b4optica cu \u00b4antica, en la que nos apoyaremos para desarrollar este proyecto.\nActualmente existe una gran demanda de instrumentaci \u00b4on que permita detectar un \u00b4unico\nfot\u00b4on con gran resoluci \u00b4on temporal y espacial, para su aplicaci \u00b4on en avances tecnol \u00b4ogicos\ncomo la criptograf \u00b4\u0131a cu \u00b4antica (o Quantum Key Distribution) [1], la comunicaci \u00b4on\u00b4optica a\ntrav\u00b4es del espacio [2, 3], mejoras en la adquisici \u00b4on de im \u00b4agenes m \u00b4edicas [4] o el campo de\nla informaci \u00b4on cu \u00b4antica [5].\nEn este trabajo caracterizaremos un tipo de detector de fot \u00b4on\u00b4unico, basado en un cable\nde dimensiones nanom \u00b4etricas que colocamos en un estado superconductor. Al mantener\neste cable ligeramente por debajo de su corriente cr \u00b4\u0131tica superconductora, la llegada de uno\no m\u00b4as fotones puede romper el estado superconductor del material, generando un cambio\nmedible en nuestro circuito que de\ufb01niremos como \u201ddetecci \u00b4on de un fot \u00b4on\u201d. Este tipo de\ndetectores, conocidos como SNSPD, ofrecen una e\ufb01ciencia de detecci \u00b4on alta [6], un nivel\nbajo de cuentas oscuras (o falsas cuentas), un amplio rango de longitudes de onda y otras\npropiedades deseables como un tiempo corto de reseteo. Esto los convierte en grandes\ncandidatos para las aplicaciones nombradas anteriormente. Generalmente este tipo de de-\ntectores han sido fabricados en NbN, un superconductor cristalino convenciona. Tambi \u00b4en\nse han desarrollado estos detectores utilizando WSi [7], MoGe [8], MoSi [9, 10, 11, 12] o\nNbTiN [13, 14]. En este proyecto, utilizaremos un SNSPD fabricado de MoSi, el cual es\nun superconductor de estructura amorfa, a diferencia del NbN. Adem \u00b4as, dispondremos de\nun detector muy similar fabricado en NbN, con el \ufb01n de comparar sus propiedades.\nEs importante se \u02dcnalar que el mecanismo de detecci \u00b4on, el proceso f \u00b4\u0131sico mediante el cual\nla energ \u00b4\u0131a del fot \u00b4on rompe el estado superconductor, no se entiende completamente [15,\n16]. Distintos materiales y dise \u02dcnos de fabricaci \u00b4on de estos detectores se \u02dcnalan a distintos\nmodelos de detecci \u00b4on existentes [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. La geometr \u00b4\u0131a de los dos detectores\nutilizados en este trabajo est \u00b4a dise \u02dcnada con el objetivo de localizar las detecciones de fot \u00b4on\ny comprender sus mecanismos f \u00b4\u0131sicos [15, 22]. Con el \ufb01n de caracterizar la respuesta\n5intr\u00b4\u0131nseca del detector, se aplica la t \u00b4ecnica de Tomograf \u00b4\u0131a Cu \u00b4antica de Detectores. Este\nm\u00b4etodo matem \u00b4atico permite obtener la respuesta completa del nanodetector, incidiendo\ncon pulsos coherentes de luz generados por un l \u00b4aser. Ajustaremos los datos a una funci \u00b4on\ntomogr \u00b4a\ufb01ca que relaciona la base de estados coherentes j\u000bicon la base de Fock jii(o base\nde n\u00b4umero de fotones), para as \u00b4\u0131 obtener la respuesta intr \u00b4\u0131nseca del detector. El objetivo de\neste trabajo es: caracterizar las propiedades superconductoras de nuestro detector de fot \u00b4on\n\u00b4unico fabricado en MoSi, comparar su rendimiento contando fotones con el de un detector\nde NbN y con trabajos anteriores realizados con detectores de MoSi. Se muestra la t \u00b4ecnica\nde Tomograf \u00b4\u0131a Cu \u00b4antica de Detector, y se describen dos mejoras al montaje experimental\nutilizado en la tomograf \u00b4\u0131a.\n1 Introduction\nDetecting light has been one of the most prominent topics in Physics over the last century.\nMany applications have been realized using the classical treatment of light, but the current\nchallenge is to control and manipulate light at its fundamental quantum level. This lies\nin the \ufb01eld of Quantum Optics. Light detectors capable of resolving a single photon are\nthe main topic of this work. Since the \ufb01rst demonstration by Golt\u2019smann in 2011 [23],\nSuperconducting Single Photon Detectors (SSPD) are a prime candidate for quantum optics\napplications because they combine a very high detection ef\ufb01ciency with high counting\nspeed (of the order of GHz). Applications include technological breakthroughs such as\nquantum key distribution (QKD) [1], quantum information [5], free space communications\n[2] or medical imaging developments [4].\nThe main advantages of these detectors are their low dark count rate, high detection\nef\ufb01ciency, broad wavelength range (up to mid-infrared), very low timing jitter and short\nreset time [6]. Compared to other technologies used to detect single photons, these devices\nuse two main features: superconductivity and a nanoscale structure. A SSPD typically\ndetects single photons when operated in the superconducting state and biased just below its\ncritical current Ic. The arrival of a photon breaks the superconducting state and leads to a\nmeasurable change in the circuit, in the form of a voltage pulse that represents a \u2019detection\nevent\u2019. To date, most SSPD\u2019s have been fabricated in NbN, but they have been realized in\nother superconductors such as WSi [7], MoGe [8, 24], MoSi [9, 10, 11] or NbTiN [13, 14].\nWe will work with a superconducting nanowire single photon detector fabricated in\nMoSi. This is an amorphous superconductor, structurally different to crystalline supercon-\nductors such as NbN. Amorphous superconductors make the fabrication of the detectors\nmuch less restrictive on the substrate, temperature and sputtering conditions of the material.\nMoSi also a lower superconducting gap and lower critical current density than NbN. Su-\nperconducting single photon detectors based on amorphous materials seem to yield higher\nef\ufb01ciencies, as a qualitative difference in the ef\ufb01ciency as a function of photon energy has\n6been observed [25, 26]. The reasons for this discrepancy between MoSi [25] and NbN\n[26] are still unknown. It should be stated that these results were obtained using different\ndevice geometries, which could be responsible for differences in the outcome of the exper-\niments. To account for this, we will study a MoSi nanodetector with a geometry analogous\nto the NbN detector used in Ref. [26] and also compare it with earlier results on MoSi\nnanodetector with a different geometry.\nThe geometry of our detector is based around a nanoconstriction, a wedge in the nanowire.\nThis constriction is the most narrow area of the detector (150 nm wide), therefore having\nthe highest critical current density. This makes the nanoconstriction the most ef\ufb01cient\npart of the detector and we will usually regard it as the only active area. These detectors,\ncalled Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors (SNSPD), are ideal for measur-\ning multi-photon events and exploring the underlying mechanism that causes the energy\nof the photon to break the superconducting state. This is an important question, as under-\nstanding which is the underlying process behind photon detection will help designing and\nfabricating faster and more ef\ufb01cient single photon detectors.\nThe goal of this thesis is to characterize the superconducting properties of a MoSi thin\n\ufb01lm nanodetector, measure its photon counting properties and comparing them to earlier re-\nsults. Quantum Detector Tomography (QDT) is needed to obtain and quantify the response\nof our SNSPD. We present this technique and implement changes in the experimental setup\nin order to enhance QDT. Previous research conducted at Leiden University [26] has shown\nthis is an essential step towards testing the current models on the detection mechanism for\nthese devices.\n72. Metodolog \u00b4\u0131a experimental\nA continuaci \u00b4on, se presentan los m \u00b4etodos experimentales utilizados en este proyecto. Comen-\nzamos describiendo los detectores de fot \u00b4on\u00b4unico que utilizaremos, uno de un superconduc-\ntor amorfo como MoSi, y otro de NbN, un material superconductor cristalino utilizado am-\npliamente en este campo. Ambos detectores tienen una geometr \u00b4\u0131a de nanoconstricci \u00b4on. El\nnanocable por el que circula corriente y donde inciden los fotones, tiene un estrechamiento\nque constituye la zona activa del detector. Esto se debe a la elevada densidad de corriente\nen esta constricci \u00b4on. La principal ventaja de dicha geometr \u00b4\u0131a es que podemos localizar\nlas detecciones de fot \u00b4on para investigar qu \u00b4e procesos intervienen en ellas. Adem \u00b4as, como\nla zona activa es muy reducida, aumentan nuestras posibilidades de observar eventos de\ndetecci \u00b4on de varios fotones cercanos.\nEl objetivo principal del experimento es iluminar el detector con luz coherente y reg-\nistrar su respuesta como pulsos de voltaje que representan fotones detectados. El mon-\ntaje experimental consiste de dos partes bien diferenciadas, el montaje \u00b4optico y el circuito\nel\u00b4ectrico. En el montaje \u00b4optico, el objetivo ser \u00b4a dirigir la iluminaci \u00b4on del l \u00b4aser hacia el\ndetector, y controlar la misma utilizando una serie de atenuadores, espejos y lentes. As \u00b4\u0131\nmismo, se usa un prisma para obtener rayos secundarios con los que caracterizar en tiempo\nreal la potencia del l \u00b4aser incidente. El circuito el \u00b4ectrico alimenta al nanodetector con una\ncorriente continua, cerca de la corriente cr \u00b4\u0131tica superconductora Ic; a la vez que registra\nla detecci \u00b4on de fotones como pulsos de corriente alterna, que dirigiremos a una cadena de\nampli\ufb01cadores. El detector de fot \u00b4on\u00b4unico se modeliza como un interruptor en paralelo con\nuna resistencia, donde la posici \u00b4on cerrado representa el estado superconductor y la posici \u00b4on\nabierta representa el estado normal resistivo del aparato.\nFinalmente, se introduce la Tomograf \u00b4\u0131a Cu \u00b4antica de Detectores como un m \u00b4etodo matem \u00b4atico\nque permite caracterizar la respuesta completa del detector. \u00b4Este m \u00b4etodo se basa en rela-\ncionar la respuesta del detector a estados coherentes con la respuesta a estados de Fock,\nestados cu \u00b4anticos con un n \u00b4umero medio de fotones bien de\ufb01nido. Adem \u00b4as, se modi\ufb01ca este\nm\u00b4etodo para facilitar su implementaci \u00b4on, agrupando todas las fuentes de atenuaci \u00b4on en un\n\u00b4unico par \u00b4ametro\u0011. Esto reduce enormemente la complejidad del an \u00b4alisis tomogr \u00b4a\ufb01co.\n82 Setup and methods\n2.1 Superconducting nanodetectors\nIn this thesis, we will work with amorphous MoSi and crystalline NbN based single photon\ndetectors. The geometry of these detectors features a nanoconstriction where the highest\ncurrent density is concentrated. This constriction is by far the most sensitive area of the\nSNSPD and we can assume all detection events happening in this active area [27]. These\nnanodetectors detect single photons when they are biased near their superconducting criti-\ncal current. In this situation, an inciding photon can break the superconducting state with\nits energy, generating a pulse that constitutes a \u2019detection event\u2019. The NbN detector has\nan active area of 150 x 150 nm and 5 nm thickness. The studied MoSi nanodetector has\nan active area of 210 x 150 nm and it is 4.5 nm thick. Localizing all detection events im-\nproves the chances of observing multi-photon events, in which more than one photon hit\nthe nanowire close in both time and space. These multi-photon events give us information\nabout the response of the detector as a function of the total absorbed energy [26, 28]. We\nwill present a tomographic method to investigate the intrinsic response of the detector, as\nwell as the underlying mechanism of photon counting.\nFigure 2.1: Superconducting MoSi nanodetectors. a) Microscopic image of a chip carrier\nwith 8 detectors b) SEM image of the 150 nm wide nanoconstriction. Images provided by\nV . Verma, NIST (Boulder, EEUU)\n9Figure 2.2: Layout used in the design of the MoSi nanodetectors, illustrating the relative\ndimensions of the meanders. Image provided by V . Verma, NIST (Boulder, EEUU\nFigure 2.1 shows an optical microscope image of a chip with 8 MoSi nanodetectors\n(left) and a SEM image of the 150nmwide detector (right). In the \ufb01rst image, the nanode-\ntectors can be seen as triangular constrictions around the yellow cross. This cross serves\na gold contact pads, that we use to put current through the detectors. The MoSi \ufb01lm was\nsputtered on top of a Si wafer, with a SiO 2layer beneath it. In Figure 2.2 we can see\nthe layout for the design of two MoSi nanodetectors, consisting of two meanders and the\nnanoconstriction or active area. The meander are long zig-zag loops of the same nanowire\nwhich act as a coil. Two meandersare added to increase the inductance of the device, in\norder to avoid a very short reset time that could cause latching of the detector. [29]. These\ndevices were fabricated by Varum Verma at NIST (Boulder, EEUU). More information on\nthe fabrication of similar MoSi nanodetectors is available in Refs. [8, 11, 9, 12]\n2.2 Optical setup\nThe main goal of the experiment is to characterize the response of the detector, using a\nrange of coherent states. These states are prepared by attenuation of the laser beam, that\nis then directed into the single photon detector, which is put inside a cryostat. The main\nquantities under study are: i) the count rate of the detector, ii) the optical power on the\ndetector. The current through the detector is also controlled, using the electric setup. Figure\n10Figure 2.3: Schematic drawing of the optical setup used to perform Quantum Detector\nTomography on our SNSPD inside the cryostat\n2.2 shows a schematic representation of the optical setup, where some mirrors and \ufb01lters\nare elapsed. Our setup starts with a Fianium SC400 pulsed white light laser. This laser\nsource operates at a repetition rate of 20 MHz and creates pulses of 20-30 ps duration. We\n\ufb01lter the output of the source with various dichroic mirrors, low-pass \ufb01lters and a bandpass\n\ufb01lter centered around the desired wavelength (780 nm). On the optical table, the laser\npasses through a crossed polarizer system with a \u0015=2plate between them.This acts as a\nvariable attenuator, allowing to tune the input pump power. By rotating this \u0015=2plate, we\nvary the transmission according to Malus'law.\nI(\u0012) =I0cos2(2\u0012) (1)\nwhere\u0012is the angle of the \u0015=2plate. It is important to align the polarizers in a perfectly\ncrossed con\ufb01guration, so the transmission after the attenuator is initially zero. The laser\nbeam must also incide perpendicular to the polarizers, in order to achieve maximum tuning\nrange of the power. Thereafter, the laser beam is directed into the cryostat and towards\nthe detector, passing through various apertures and mirrors. Using the apertures we can\ncalibrate the optical setup, making sure the ray is being directed correctly.\nBefore illuminating the detector the laser beam passes through a beam splitter (BS),\nwhich creates secondary rays that we will use to monitor the power and obtain an image of\nthe laser spot on the SNSPD. A secondary ray is collected with a power meter (Thorlabs\nPM100D). This ray will allow to estimate the optical power on the detector without block-\ning the laser beam, using the re\ufb02ection and transmission coef\ufb01cientes (T(\u0015);R(\u0015))of the\n11BS for the selected wavelenghts (780 nm).\nOn the other arm of the BS, we have a 2x magni\ufb01cation CCD Camera collecting light\nthat comes from inside the cryostat and reaches the camera after re\ufb02ecting off the beam\nsplitter. This secondary ray, along with a conventional lamp that illuminates inside the\ncryostat, can be used to image our detector along with the laser beam in real time. The\nimage helps aligning the input laser in order to achieve high count rates. The \u0015=2plate\nbefore the window of the cryostat is used to control the polarization of the incoming light,\nwhile a lens ( f= 10cm) focuses the laser beam on the nanoconstriction of the detector.\nIn the experiments, the polarization will not be changed so the angle of the \u0015=2plate is\nkept in the con\ufb01guration that maximizes ef\ufb01ciency (with the electrical \ufb01eld parallel to the\nnanowire). The cryostat keeps the SNSPD at a pressure of v10\u00007mbar, with a base\ntemperature of v3:5K.\n2.3 Electrical circuit\nThe purpose of the electrical circuit behind the detector is multiple. First, a DC current\nsource must be used to bias the nanodetector close to its critical current. Then, the circuit\nmust also read out and amplify the voltage pulses generated by photon detection.\nLet\u2019s start with the equivalent circuit for the nanodetector. The detector is modelled by\na switch in parallel with a resistor, of value RN. In series with this, there is an inductor\nrepresenting the kinetic inductance. This equivalent circuit is represented on the left side\nof Figure 2.4, and is biased with current Ib. To provide this DC current to the nanodetector,\nwe use a voltage source (Yokogawa GS200) in series with a resistor Rb= 100 \n . When the\ndetector is superconducting, the switch is closed and the current Ib\ufb02ows, set by the voltage\nsource and the load resistor. When a photon incides on the nanowire the superconducting\nstate is destroyed, and the switch opens. This generates a voltage peak that needs to be\nampli\ufb01ed, and consitutes a \u2019detection event\u2019. The current now sees a big resistance RN, of\nthe order of M \ns, so it is quickly shunted into the load resistor due to RN>> Rb= 100\n\n. The circuit has now turned into a voltage bias and the cooling of the cryostat can restore\nthe superconducting state of the nanowire. The current Ibwill restart \ufb02owing through the\ndetector once it is cooled down suf\ufb01ciently. There is another inductor and a capacitor\ninside a Bias Tee, which \ufb01lter high frequencies from the current bias before it enters the\nsuperconducting single photon detector. This Bias Tee (ZNBT-60-1W) has a 2.5-6000 MHz\nbandwidth, and acts as a low-pass \ufb01lter for the current source.\nThe second part of this circuit is the readout, amplifying the signal and sending it to an\nappropiate instrument. To \ufb01lter out low frequencies from the signal, an extra capacitor is\nplace inside the Bias Tee. We then use a 50 \nresistance between points A'and B'to match\nthe impedance of the ampli\ufb01ers with the rest of the circuit. Therefore, re\ufb02ections of the\nsignal at this point are avoided. The signal of the transient is transferred and it is high-\npass \ufb01ltered by the combination of the capacitor inside the Bias Tee, the 50 \nresistance\n12Figure 2.4: Equivalent electrical circuit for the experiment. The shaded area on the left\nrepresents the equivalent circuit of the superconducting single photon detector.\nand the capacitance at the input of the ampli\ufb01ers. Only high frequency signals (20-3000\nMHz). This voltage is then fed to a set of two RF ampli\ufb01ers (mini-circuits ZX60-3018G-\nS+), which are connected to an oscilloscope via coaxial cable. Usually, the oscilloscope\nis substituted by a pulse-counter (Agilent 53131A) in which we set a trigger voltage to\ndiscriminate noise. A typical detection event has peak height of around 0.5 mV . Note that\nthe peak height of the pulse is set by the load resistance Rband the bias current used Ib. For\nvery low bias currents, detection events can not be recorded reliably, due to a peak height\ncomparable to the background noise.\nAs mentioned before, resetting the detector is key for this circuit. After photon detec-\ntion, the switch will be opened due to a resistive barrier happening in the nanowire. This\ncan be seen as a self-heating hotspot where superconductivity is destroyed. The current is\ndirected away from this resistance, on a timescale \u001cfall,\n\u001cfall=LK\nRb+RN(2)\nwhereLKis the kinetic inductance of the nanodetector. At the same time, the cooling\npower of the cryostat will restore the superconducting state of the nanowire. The timescale\n\u001cthermal represents the counteraction between the thermal diffusion of the resistive area and\nthe cooling power of the cryostat. When the nanowire is again superconducting, the current\nwill promptly \ufb02ow back through the nanodetector.\n13The timescale for the current returning is \u001crise,\n\u001crise=LK\nRb(3)\nThe kinetic inductance is an intrinsic effect which counteracts rapid changes in the\ncurrent. It arises from the inertia of high mobility carriers (electrons) in AC current [30].\nThese carriers have a non-zero mass and need to be accelerated. In alternating \ufb01elds, an\neffect analogous to a series inductance appears. The kinetic inductance sets the resetting\ntimescales for this circuit. Therefore, it also sets the maximum count rate than can be\nachieved. An extensive study on the appearance and role of kinetic inductance in SNSPD\u2019s\nis presented in Ref. [29]. Figure 2.5 shows a typical detection event, from which the reset\ntime can be estimated.\nFigure 2.5: Shape of a detection pulse, averaged over 1000 events. The gray trace shows\nan individual event\nIdeally,LKshould be small in order to obtain fast reset times. In practice we cannot\nhave\u001crise.\u001cthermal , where\u001cthermal accounts for the interaction between the cooling power\nof the cryostat and the intrinsic Joule heating of a detection event. If the current is restored\nbefore the device has cooled down suf\ufb01ciently, the superconducting state will not be recov-\nered after a detection. The detector will either remain in its normal state or switch between\n14the superconducting and normal states inde\ufb01nitely. This is known as \u2019latching\u2019 of the de-\ntector, and does not allow any further photon counting [31]. To avoid this, two meanders\nwere added above and under the nanodetector (see Figure 2.2), in order to increase LKto\nan acceptable value and avoid latching. From the experimental reset time, we estimate the\nkinetic inductance to be LK\u0019300 nH. The two meanders also account for most of the\nresistance of the detector in its normal state RN.\n2.4 Quantum Detector Tomography (QDT)\nThe main tool we will use to characterize our detector is Quantum Detector Tomography\n(QDT) [32, 33]. This is an agnostic non-projective measurement method, in which we\nfeed the detector with different coherent states by attenuation of the laser illumination,\nand measure its count rate. The goal is obtaining the click probability of the detector\nwhen N photons are incident on it. We probe the detector with a set of coherent states\nj\u000bi, controlling the input power and then we extract the response of the detector to the\nphoton number states jii. This is achieved by relating the coherent state basis j\u000biand the\nphoton number (Fock) basis jii. Mathematically, Quantum Detector Tomography is an\ninverse statistical problem. It is based on the Positive-Operator Valued Measure (POVM)\nformalism and the problem can be seen as solving this equation for the matrix \u0005, which\ncontains the intrinsic response of the detector [34],\nP=F\u0005 (4)\nwherePrepresents the measured statistics and Fis the translation matrix between the basis\nof coherent and Fock states (photon number basis).\nThe matrix \u0005is diagonal in the Fock state basis for phase-insensitive detectors, such\nas this MoSi single photon detector. The diagonal elements of the matrix represent the\nresponse of the detector to states with different mean number of photons. These diagonal\nelements can be written as\n\u0019n=1X\nk=0p(n)\nkjkihkj (5)\nwhere the coef\ufb01cients p(n)\nkgive the weight of each Fock state in the response of the detector.\nThe click probabilities per pulse pi, given an input coheren state \u001a, are de\ufb01ned as p\u001a;n=\nTr(\u001a\u0019n). Therefore, estimating this matrix \u0005would unveil the complete response of the\ndetector. The two representations, coherent states basis and Fock states basis, are connected\nthrough the expression for an arbitrary coherent state in the photon number basis, given by:\nj\u000bi=e\u00001\n2j\u000bj21X\nn=0\u000bn\np\nn!jni (6)\n15This poissonian distribution is shown in Figure 2.6.\nThe goal of Quantum Detector Tomography is obtaining the detection probability of the\ndetectorpifor each state in the Fock basis, which have a well de\ufb01ned mean number of pho-\ntonsi. The method can \ufb01nd this response \ufb01tting the experimental data to this tomographic\nfunction\nRclick(N) = 1\u0000e\u0000\u0011NmX\ni=0(1\u0000pi)(\u0011N)i\ni!(7)\nwhereRclick(N)represents the click probability of the detector for N photons inciding, pi\nrepresents the detection ef\ufb01ciency for i photons and \u0011is a parameter modelling all sources\nof attenuation. Therefore, QDT can \ufb01nd the response of the detector in the Fock basis jni\nby using coherent states j\u000bias a probe and \ufb01tting the results to Equation 7. An important\nproperty of coherent states is that they remain coherent after attenuation, lowering the mean\nnumber of photons N present in a laser pulse. To simplify the \ufb01tting procedure of QDT,\na modi\ufb01cation is introduced in the technique. Low ef\ufb01ciency detectors, such as this MoSi\nnanodetector, require many parameters pito accurately describe its complete response (at\nleast1\n\u0011parameters). Introducing the parameter \u0011, which represents all sources of photon\nloss, tomography now works with the number of photons that are absorbed by the nanode-\ntector\u0011N, instead of the mean number of photons in the laser pulse N. This method has\nbeen previously implemented in Refs. [35, 36, 37], dramatically reducing the number of \ufb01t\nparameterspineeded to reconstruct the click probability for the detector Rclick.\nFigure 2.6: Poissonian distribution of the coherent states in terms of the photon number\nstates. The vertical axis representes frequency and the horizontal axis contains the photon\nnumber states.\n16The parameter \u0011represents all losses due to attenuation, alignment and intrisic absorp-\ntion of the elements in the system. We assume these losses to be linear, differently than\nthe nonlinear multi-photon detection events. Therefore, the experiment is modelled as an\nattenuated input laser inciding on an ideal (100 % ef\ufb01cient) detector. Experimentally, we\nfeed the detector with attenuated coherent states and then measure the optical power incid-\ning on the detector and the count rate recorded by the detector. The quantities used in the\ntomographic function are the mean number of photons of the pulse Niand the normalized\nclick probability for a probe state. To convert measured optical power Pito mean number\nof photons per pulse Ni, we useNi=Pi\u0015\n\nhc, wherehc\n\u0015is the energy of each photon, and \nis\nthe repetition rate of the laser. The click probability is equal to the count rate Rinormal-\nized to the laser repetition rate \nafter correcting for the dark counts Di,ri=Ri\u0000Di\n\n. A\nmore detailed look on this tomographic protocol is presented in the Appendix. In Section\n3.3.2, we describe how the experimental setup was modi\ufb01ed to improve the accuracy of\ntomography experiments.\n3.

We expect the\nthe resistance of the device to decrease rapidly after reaching a critical superconducting\ntemperature Tc. In Figure 3.1, the superconducting behaviour of the nanodetector can be\nobserved. The inset of the \ufb01gure shows a short circuit used to monitor the resistance of our\n150 nm wide detector. The resistance is measured using a 0:7\u0016Aprobe current while the\ncryostat is cooled down to base temperature, in order to obtain the resistance as a function\nof temperature. We \ufb01nd a critical superconducting temperature of Tc= 4:98K. This value\nwill be used later to obtain the critical current at 0 K for this detector. For NbN and other\ncrystalline materials, the resistance R increases with decreasing temperatures approaching\nits critical value Tc[38]. A plausible explanation arises from the crystalline structure of\nthe compound. In a grain boundary scattering models, electrons use thermal energy to hop\nover these grain boundaries that act as trapping potentials [39].\nFigure 3.1: Resistance as a function of temperature for a 150 nm wide MoSi constriction,\nshowing thatd\u001a(T)\ndT<0. The inset shows a closer look at the superconducting transition\nand a schematic picture of the short circuit used to measure the resistance.\n18Nevertheless, we \ufb01nd similar phenomena for MoSi, which is an amorphous material.\nTherefore, this explanation for the increase of resistance when lowering the temperature is\nnot satisfactory, as an amorphous material does not contain periodic grain boundaries. In-\nstead, we note that this experimental observations are consistent with the Mooij empirical\nrule [40]. It states that materials whose resistivity is above 150 \u0016\n=cm present a negative\ntemperature dependence on the resistivityd\u001a(T)\ndT<0. In our detector, this value is \u001a= 195\n\u0016\n=cm. Several theories have explored this behaviour observed by Mooij in 1973 [40].\nOne of these models is that of \u2019weak localization of the electrons\u2019. In materials with high\nstructural disorder in their lattice, the quantum wavefunction of electrons decays strongly\nat large distances from the center of the wavepacket. All the relevant states (those near the\nFermi energy EF) are localized, causing electrons to have very low mobility and making\nthe material behave as an insulator. This is common in superconductivity as many super-\nconductors, including all the high Tcsuperconductors, present a metal-insulator transition\nat very low temperatures. A rigorous analysis of this phenomena is presented in Ref [41].\n3.1.2 I-V curves\nI-V curves are one of the main methods to characterize electronic devices. For supercon-\nducting devices, one expects a \ufb01nite amount of current to \ufb02ow even when the voltage over\nthe device is zero. It is important to note that our circuit is not designed as a pure voltage\nbias or current bias. Its goal is to restore the superconducting state in the nanowire after\ndetecting a photon, resetting the detector. Consequently, the I-V curves presented here are\nnot strictly standard I-V curves, widely used for the characterization of electric devices\nsuch as diodes or junctions.\nFigure 3.2 shows an I-V curve for the 210 nm wide MoSi detector, at three different\ntemperatures. Three distinct regimes can be identi\ufb01ed: i)The superconducting regime, ii)\nthe breaking of superconductivity and iii) the normal state. We determine the critical cur-\nrentIcfrom the limits of the superconducting region, as a sharp transition in the measured\ncurrent. When the temperature is increased, the superconducting region is reduced and the\ntransition becomes smoother. Note that we are using a voltage source in series with a resis-\ntanceRbto feed current to the detector. Therefore, a vertical line indicating zero resistance\nwill not appear for the superconducting state of the detector, due to this load resistance Rb.\n19Figure 3.2: I-V curves of the 210 nm wide MoSi nanodetector at different temperatures\nFigure 3.3: I-V curves of the 150 nm wide NbN detector at two different temperatures.\n20Between\u0006Icthe nanodetector is superconducting and presents zero resistance. An\nohmic behaviour is observed which we can \ufb01t to obtain a total resistance Rb= 107 \n . This\nvalue represents the load resistance ( \u0018100 \n ) plus some resistance from the wiring in the\nsetup. According to the equivalent circuit for the nanodetector (See Figure 2.3), the switch\nis closed and the detector has no resistance RSC= 0.\nWhen the current reaches Ic, the wire enters a relaxation oscillation regime, in which\nthe detector switches rapidly between the normal and superconducting state. The measured\nvalues in this region are not representative, as only a time average of these \ufb02uctuations is\nrecorded. The \ufb02uctuations happen at a higher frequency than the frequency of the ampli\ufb01ers\nused. More information on the relaxation-oscillation regime for these detectors can be\nfound in Ref.[28].\nLastly, when some parts of the detector have become resistive, an ohmic regime with\na much larger resistance appears. For currents \u0000Ic> I > Icwe observe linear behaviour\nwith a resistance of the order of K\ns. If the current was further increased, all parts of the\ndetector would become resistive and we would get back R=RN+Rb. This would be the\ncase of a horizontal line, with slope close to zero. For comparison, we show in Figure 3.3\nthe I-V curves obtained for the NbN nanodetector at two different temperatures. The curves\nshown in Figures 3.2 and 3.3 are very similar. NbN shows a bigger superconducting region,\nas this material has higher values for both critical current Icand critical temperature. Tc.\nIn both materials, the breaking of superconductivity is less sharp when the temperature\napproaches its critical value, due to thermal excitations. This makes the detectors less\nef\ufb01cient when operating close to their critical temperature Tc.\n3.1.3 Critical current vs. temperature\nAfter recording many I-V curves at different temperatures, we extract from them values\nfor the critical current and construct a relation between IcandT. The criteria for the\ncritical current will be the start of the relaxation-oscillation regime. The last points in\nthis graph have a bigger uncertainty associated, as \ufb01nding Icis harder when the transition\nis less clear for higher temperatures. In Figure 3.4, the decrease of the critical current\nwith increasing temperatures is observed. This can be intuitively understood as thermal\nexcitations contributing to the breaking of superconductivity at lower currents.\nThen we \ufb01t our values to the expression shown in the graph, from Ginzburg-Landau\ntheory of superconductivity. The \ufb01tting provides values for the critical temperature (with\nzero current applied) and critical current (at T = 0 K) of the detector. It is important to\nnote thatIcwill determine the maximum bias current we can use to count photons, and\nconsequently, the maximum pulse height of a detection event. When operating the detector\nat 3.85 K, the critical current is approximately 2:6\u0016A. Multiplying this current by the 50\n\nresistor in the ampli\ufb01ers and the gain of the ampli\ufb01er chain, we obtain a pulse height of\nunder 200 mV . This constitutes a problem as now the signal and the noise are comparable,\n21Figure 3.4: Decrease of the critical current for increasing temperatures. Fit was made us-\ning the Ginzburg-Landau dependence speci\ufb01ed in the graph. Values for TcandI0obtained\nfrom the \ufb01t are also shown.\nand we cannot set a proper trigger voltage. This was experimentally found, as there were\nno signi\ufb01cant counts above T= 3:85K. This problem can be solved by using ampli\ufb01ers\nwith less noise, operating at lower temperature or including a low pass \ufb01lter to eliminate\nthe low-frequency noise.\n3.2 Photon counting properties\n3.2.1 Detection ef\ufb01ciency of the nanowire\nSo far, we have only characterized the material and conducting properties of the detector.\nLet\u2019s now look into the detection events (or counts) that the detector records. In SNSPD\u2019s, a\ndetection event occurs when the arrival of one or more photons affects the superconducting\nstate of the wire, driving it to the resistive state temporarily and creating a voltage pulse.\nTo characterize the detector, we record its count rate, the current \ufb02owing through it and\nthe optical power inciding on the detector. Before presenting the experimental results, let\u2019s\noutline the features of these detectors that will not be experimentally probed. In this thesis,\nwe will not consider the Local Detection Ef\ufb01ciency [42] which is the pro\ufb01le of ef\ufb01ciency\n22of the nanowire along its width. In short, the edges of the detector are more sensitive to\ndetecting photons, since they have a lower threshold current for photons for a \ufb01xed energy.\nIf we increase the bias current Ib, the ef\ufb01ciency will increase throughout the wire but it will\nremain higher for photons absorbed near the edges of the nanowire. [43].\nIn addition, the detection ef\ufb01ciency of this device depends on polarization. When illu-\nminating the single photon detector with light polarized parallel to the length of the wire,\nthe count rate will be higher than for any other polarization. This polarization dependence\nis due to the boundary conditions that appear when solving Maxwell\u2019s equations for the\nlight inciding on the detector. Furthermore, we can play with the width of the nanowire\nto test this effect. Narrower wires will have a higher ef\ufb01ciency overall (because there\u2019s\nmore \u2019edge\u2019), but a lower ratio between polarizationsRk\nR?because of the loss in ef\ufb01ciency\ndetecting perpendicularly polarized light. Lastly, optical cavities have been demostrated\nto enhance the ef\ufb01ciency of the detectors[44]. It seems likely that any future application\nof this technology will be paired with a proper optical cavity, in order to obtain a better\nperformance.\n3.2.2 Counting photons\nIn this section, we will study how the count rate of our detector changes when the bias\ncurrent is modi\ufb01ed. If the detector is biased close to its critical current Ib\u0019Ic, the energy\nof a single photon will be enough to break superconductivity and produce a count. In this\nsituation, most pulses from the laser will trigger a detection event, as these pulses contain\nmillions photons at minimum. Therefore, the count rate is expected to approach the laser\nrepetition rate, i.e. the number of pulses per second produced by the laser. This value is 20\nMHz for our pulsed laser source.\nConversely, as the bias current Ibis lowered, we expect the count rate to decrease,\ngiven that now the device is further from the superconducting-to-normal transition and it\nmay require more than one photon to trigger a detection. This multi-photon events are\nless probable, as the two photons must be absorbed very close in both space and time. As\ndiscussed earlier, the nanowire geometry of our detector restricts the area where photon\ndetection happens, improving the chances of recording multi-photon events. As discussed\nin Section 3.1.2, once we bias the detector very close to its critical current Ic, we enter the\nrelaxation-oscillation regime where we can no longer extract meaningful information from\nthe count rate. In fact, count rates higher than 20 MHz can be recorded in this regime, in\nwhich the nanoconstriction oscillates between the normal and superconducting state.\nIn this experiment,the total count rate is recorded, including photon counts and dark\ncounts. By repeating this measurement while blocking the laser beam, we can extract the\nrate of dark counts and substract it from the total count rate. The voltage pulse created by\na dark count is identical to that of a photon detection. Nevertheless, dark counts have an\nexponential dependence on bias current, which also helps distinguishing photon and dark\n23Figure 3.5: Count rate of the MoSi detector when approaching its critical current, Ic=\n6\u0016A. The used wavelength is \u0015= 780 nm. Dashed lines indicate current for 1 KHz of dark\ncounts\nFigure 3.6: Count rate of the NbN detector when approaching its critical current, Ic=\n22\u0016A. The used wavelength is \u0015= 780 nm. Dashed lines indicate current for 1 KHz of\ndark counts\n24counts. In literature, there\u2019s a consensus about dark counts being due to thermally activated\nvortices crossing the wire[26, 28, 21, 45]. The movement of the vortices dissipates energy\nwhich breaks the superconducting regime [46]. It has been shown that dark counts increase\nsigni\ufb01cantly if the temperature is increased or if a magnetic \ufb01eld perpendicular to the wire\nis applied. [47].\nIn Figure 3.5 and 3.6, we show the count rate for our MoSi and NbN detectors when\nilluminated with 780 nm laser light. Both measurements were performed at base tempera-\ntureT= 3:35K. The maximum count rate achieved in the MoSi nanodetector is 6 MHz,\nslightly lower than the count rate of the NbN nanodetector. The count rate of both single\nphoton detectors is similar when increasing the bias current towards its critical value Ic. As\nexpected, the count rate in the MoSi nanodetector is highest for currents near the critical\ncurrent, as just one photon is enough to break superconductivity in this scenario. Dark\ncounts are also higher when close to the critical current, but they always remain signi\ufb01-\ncantly lower than photon counts.\nOne main difference is the range of bias currents. For MoSi, this interval is much\nsmaller than for NbN, due to the lower critical temperature Tcin MoSi. This means that\nthe base temperature of our cryostat ( Tc= 3:35K) is closer to Tcfor this material, and the\ncritical current is signi\ufb01cantly reduced (See Figure 3.4). As mentioned before in Section\n3.1.3, the signal to noise ratio will limit the temperature at which the detector can detect\nphotons consistently. For comparison, in previous studies for this NbN detector, counts\nwere reliable up to a relative temperature of tr=T\nTc= 0:88. On the other hand, using the\nMoSi nanodetector we could detect photons reliably up to tr= 0:79.\nDark counts also show a different behaviour. The MoSi detector records 1 KHz of dark\ncounts at a current very close to Ic, in contrast to NbN. This may suggest that MoSi has\nless dark counts overall, making it a prime candidate for quantum information applications.\nThe dark count rate of NbN shows a clearer exponential growth for all current values.\nMeanwhile, in MoSi dark counts for low bias currents seem to have a random statistical\nspread. These dark counts start growing exponentially from 4.7 \u0016Aonwards, possibly\nsignaling a different cause to these dark counts at low currents.\nLastly, we plot the counting rate of the MoSi nanodetector in a linear scale. The purpose\nis to compare it to previous results by M. Caloz et al [25], where an universal saturation\nof the count rate is found for various photon wavelenghts. Let\u2019s remind what could cause\nsaturation in these detectors. SNSPD\u2019s maximum count rate will be limited by either the\nlaser\u2019s repetition rate, or the reset time of the electrical circuit (set by the kinetic induc-\ntance). From the voltage pulse we estimated the reset time of our detector to be 150 ns,\nwhich would give a detector maximum count rate of 6.66 GHz, much bigger than the 20\nMHz repetition rate of the pulsed laser. Therefore, this MoSi nanodetector could reach\nsaturation at 20 MHz.\n25Figure 3.7: Photon count rate of the MoSi detector while increasing the bias current at\n3.35 K. The used wavelength is \u0015= 780 nm. The count rate shows \ufb01rst signs of saturation.\nFigure 3.8: Count rate of a MoSi meander when approaching its critical current at T=0.75\nK [25]. M. Caloz et al found universal saturation of the count rate for different wave-\nlengths, i.e. photon energies.\n26In Figure 3.7, the count rate shows \ufb01rst signs of saturation when approaching Ic. This\nresult is not conclusive, as the experiment should be repeated for different wavelengths in\norder to possibly reproduce the results of Figure 3.8. It\u2019s unclear if this saturated count rate\nis a feature of the material (MoSi being an amorphous superconductor) or the geometry\nof the detector (meander or nanodetector). This universal saturation has not been found\nfor NbN nanodetectors studied in this experimental setup. Achieving a higher count rate,\ncloser to 20 MHz, is also desirable in order to compare these results to other works on\nMoSi superconducting single photon detectors.\n3.3 Applying tomography to a MoSi nanodetector\n3.3.1 Count rate vs. power\nThe following experimental results constitute the raw data used for the tomographic anal-\nysis of the detector. The count rate is recorded while varying the input pump power by\nattenuation of the laser beam. The bias current remains constant (we choose a point in\nthe horizontal axis of Figure 3.5). The tuning of the power is achieved using the variable\nattenuator, formed by two crossed polarizers with a \u0015=2plate between them. The rotation\nof this half wave plate provides the whole range of optical power transmission. Hence, a\nset of points ( Ri;Pi) is obtained for each bias current choice. The results are shown in\nFigures 3.9 and 3.10 for three different bias currents. Figure 3.9 shows the data on a log\nscale for the count rate, while Figure 3.10 features a double logarithmic scale. As expected,\nthe count rate is higher when we increase the bias current. For low transmission, the counts\ngrow very fast for all currents. When approaching 100 % transmission, the counts stabilize\nat different values for each bias current.\nMulti-photon events are expected to be prominent for lower bias currents. As demon-\nstrated in Ref [48], if we plot this measurements in a double logarithmic scale, the slope\nof the curve indicates the dominant i-photon event. A slope equal to one would signal\na one-photon regime and a slope equal to two would indicate that two photon events are\ndominant at this bias current. This is shown in Figure 3.10, where all three bias current\nchoices present linear behaviour with slope m= 1. This is different from results obtained\nin NbN, as higher slopes (at least m=2) are expected when using bias currents far from the\ncritical current. These multi-photon events do appear in the crystalline NbN, but it is still\nunclear if a two-photon regime exists for this MoSi nanodetector.\nIn any case, Quantum Detector Tomography would unveil this regime and other features\nof the detector. For tomography purposes, it is desirable to have very low count rates for\nlow powers and to approach saturation (20 MHz) when the transmission is 100 %.\n27Figure 3.9: Counting rate of the detector as a function of optical input power for three\ndifferent bias currents, on a logarithmic scale. The power is increased by rotating the \u0015=2\nplate in our variable attenuator.\nFigure 3.10: Double logarithmic scale plot of the count rate as a function of optical input\npower. There is a slope equal to one for the three bias currents, signaling one photon\nregimes.\n28In order to apply the QDT formalism explained in Section 2.3, the count rate and the\nincident optical power are recorded. Then, these quantities are transformed into a click\nprobabilityriand a mean number of photones per pulse Ni. Therefore, Quantum Detector\nTomography will take datasets of the form (ri;Ni)and extract extract the probabilities\npifori= 1;2;3;:::K while \ufb01ltering linear losses using the parameter \u0011. Applying the\ntomographiy involves \ufb01tting the data mentioned above to Equation 3.1:\nRclick(N) = 1\u0000e\u0000\u0011NmX\ni=0(1\u0000pi)(\u0011N)i\ni!(8)\nIt is very important to separate the notions of absorption ef\ufb01ciency and detection prob-\nability. There are many elements in the setup that can induce a loss of photons, i.e. an\nattenuation of laser light.It\u2019s dif\ufb01cult to investigate the response of the detector without\nseparating the external processes. To do so we de\ufb01ne a linear parameter \u0011related to an\nabsorption ef\ufb01ciency. In this way, the response of the detector can be analyzedusing the\nnumber of photons that actually reach the detector and are absorbed by it. These photons\nare our candidates for \u2019light counts\u2019. Using the size of the detector, the optical spot and a\n\u001825% absorption for the NbN \ufb01lm, we have a rough estimate for these linear losses of\n\u0011= 10\u00005.\nAt the time of elaborating this text, the tomographic \ufb01tting had not been sucessful with\nthe experimental data for MoSi. This constitutes the obvious next step to characterize\nthis superconducting single photon nanodetector. Successful tomography measurements\nrequire the data from Figure 3.10 to deviate from a straight line, so it\u2019s possible to \ufb01t\nmultiple parameters, i.e. \u0011andp1. To illustrate the application of Tomography to a similar\ndetector, 2 graphs from Ref. [26] are presented. These measurements were made on the\n150 nm wide NbN nanodetector previously mentioned, which has a 5 nm thickness and an\nactive area of 200x150 nm\nFigure 3.11 shows how the parameters piand\u0011change with bias current. As men-\ntioned before, at low currents, the energy of a photon may not be enough to break the\nsuperconducting state in the constriction. Therefore, multi-photon events represent a sig-\nni\ufb01cant fraction of the photon detections. As we increase the critical through the nanowire,\none-photon detections are now possible and the multi-photon events become much less\nprobable. The parameter \u0011, which represents a linear loss of photons, remains nearly inde-\npendent of current. This is consistent with our assumption on the attenuation being a linear\nprocess. The authors of Ref. [26] estimated \u0011\u001910\u00004for the NbN nanodetector..\nFigure 3.12 shows the total count rate reconstructed from the different photon number\nregimes. The data corresponds to a low bias current point, where multi-photon events are\nexpected to be signi\ufb01cant. It\u2019s important to remark that different multi-photon processes\nbecome important for different levels of optical power on the detector. This is illustrated\n29Figure 3.11: Tomography results showing the values of p1;p2;p3;p4at different bias cur-\nrents at a wavelength of 1.5 \u0016m. The parameter \u0011remains nearly constant throughout the\ncurrent range. Graph from J.J. Renema\u2019s PhD thesis [26].\nFigure 3.12: Total photon count rate, with separate contributions from different photon\nregimes. Graph from J.J. Renema\u2019s PhD thesis [26].\n30by the horizontal axis of Figure 3.12, already converted into mean number of photons\nper pulse. This graphs show the usefulness of Quantum Detector Tomography, as it can\nseparate the various contributions and extract the parameters to characterize the detector in\na single experimental run.\n3.3.2 Improving tomography experiments\nAt the initial stage of the research, there were some aspects of the experimental setup that\nlimited the accuracy of the measurements. Consequently, these problems made tomography\nharder to apply reliably on single photon detectors. Two changes were implemented in the\nsetup to improve its overall performance. Now, these two changes will be presented, along\nwith the reasoning behind the modi\ufb01cations.\nAs mentioned in the optical setup, when rotating the half wave plate in our variable\nattenuator, we expect the power and the count rate to follow Malus' law. At an initial stage\nof this research, the measured count rate did not follow Malus' law correctly. We attributed\nthis deviation to some external \ufb02uctuations (in temperature, position of the laser, vibrations)\nthat were noticeable because the spot size of the laser and the amplitude of the deviations\nwere comparable. In other words, these \ufb02uctuations were moving the laser beam out of the\nactive area of the detector, causing a drop in the count rate.\nConversely, the power meter recorded a good Malus' law because its active area is\nmuch bigger than the laser spot size and the amplitude of the deviations. Therefore, these\n\ufb02uctuations were not signi\ufb01cant, as the laser spot was still on the active area of the power\nmeter. In order to solve this, wa beam expander was removed from the setup. The purpose\nof this element was to enlarge the laser beam before the \ufb01nal lens, so we had a smaller\nspot size when focusing on the detector, increasing the overall ef\ufb01ciency. Removing the\nbeam expander made the laser spot bigger, making the count rate less sensitive to these\n\ufb02uctuations. The tradeoff is a loss in ef\ufb01ciency, as now more photons are hitting the detector\noutside of its active area. Figure 3.13 shows the count rate as a function of the angle of the\n\u0015=2plate at the initial state of the experiment (left) and after removing the beam expander\n(right).\nAnother possible improvement of the experiment is to simultaneously monitor the\npower and the count rate. The beam splitter in our setup allows us to measure the power on\nthe detector in real time, using a secondary ray directed towards a power meter. As stated\nbefore, knowing the transmission and re\ufb02ection coef\ufb01cients for this beam splitter allows\nto relate the optical power on the power meter and the optical power on the detector. In\nprevious works using Quantum Detector Tomography [26, 37], the relationship between\nthe angle of the \u0015=2plate and the optical power transmitted towards the detector had been\ntaken at a time t0. On the other hand, the counting rate for changing angle was measured\n31Figure 3.13: Count rate vs. angle before and after removing the beam expander. The\nbigger spot size on the detector minimizes the effect of other \ufb02uctuations, and the data\nfollows Malus' law for the improved setup.\nat a different time t1. The datasets used for tomography were of the form:\n[Ri(t1);P(t0)] (9)\nThis constitutes a problem if the optical power depends on time P=P(t), because we\nwould be assuming the optical power for each angle is precisely the input optical power\nmeasured at time t0. Making use of the beam splitter, we measure both variables at the\nsame time and obtain complete data sets in one run. It\u2019s important to note that this is\nnot an improvement by itself. This treatment will only enhance tomography if these two\nmeasured magnitudes are correlated: without correlation the data could be replaced by the\ntime average. To verify the correlations we \ufb01x the angle, bias current and temperature and\nlet the detector count photons for several hours (14 hours). Figure 3.14 shows the cloud of\npoints obtained.\nApplying the Pearson criteria, a moderate linear correlation is found between count rate\nand optical power, with a value of \u001a= 0:45. This implies that we can enhance the accuracy\nof tomography by introducing the complete data sets [Ri(t);Pi(t)], instead of the average\n[\u0016R;\u0016P]as the correlation contains extra information.\n32Figure 3.14: Cloud of points for \ufb01xed count rate vs. power. We \ufb01nd a moderate linear\ncorrelation.\nThese two changes in the experimental setup have been proven to help the consistency\nand accuracy of the measurements needed to perform tomography. Both this changes were\nimplemented, and will hopefully allow us to obtain better data sets and record reliable\nmulti-photon events. This would help characterizing the complete response of this MoSi\nsuperconducting nanowire single photon detector. Quantum Detector Tomography can un-\nveil the underlying detection mechanism of these devices, a key step towards designing and\nfabricating better detectors for future applications.\n334. Conclusiones\nEn este trabajo, hemos caracterizado un detector de fot \u00b4on\u00b4unico de nanocable superconduc-\ntor, fabricado en MoSi. Hemos demostrado el car \u00b4acter superconductor del nanodetector,\nhallando una temperatura cr \u00b4\u0131tica superconductora de Tc= 4:98Ky una corriente cr \u00b4\u0131tica\nsuperconductora a 0 Kelvin de Ic(0) = 30:91\u0016A. Las curvas caracter \u00b4\u0131sticas I-V muestran\nun comportamiento similar al del NbN cristalino, aunque el nanodetector de MoSi posee\nun rango superconductor m \u00b4as peque \u02dcno. En cuanto a su rendimiento detectando fotones,\nhemos estudiado su ritmo de cuentas en funci \u00b4on de la corriente que circula por el nanoca-\nble, encontrando diferencias cualitativas con resultados anterior de Caloz et al. El m \u00b4aximo\nritmo de cuentas obtenido fue de 6 MHz, por debajo del nivel de saturaci \u00b4on obtenido con el\nnanodetector de NbN (20 MHz). Obtener un mayor ritmo de cuentas es deseable a la hora\nde contrastar estos resultados, as \u00b4\u0131 como utilizar un rango amplio de longitudes de onda.\nLa corriente cr \u00b4\u0131tica experimental a la temperatura base del sistema fue de Ic= 6\u0016Acon\nT= 3:35K.\nHasta ahora, no se han registrado su\ufb01cientes eventos de m \u00b4as de un fot \u00b4on, lo cual hace\nque no sea posible aplicar el m \u00b4etodo tomogr \u00b4a\ufb01co al detector usando estos resultados. Se\nesperaba hallar un r \u00b4egimen donde los eventos multi-fot \u00b4on fueran dominantes al aplicar una\ncorriente baja. M \u00b4as investigaci \u00b4on es necesaria en esta direcci \u00b4on, con el \ufb01n de aplicar la\nTomograf \u00b4\u0131a Cu \u00b4antica de Detectores y obtener la respuesta completa del nanodetector de\nMoSi. Por \u00b4ultimo, se presentan dos mejoras al montaje experimental. La exclusi \u00b4on de\nun expansor de haz hace que el sistema sea m \u00b4as robusto frente a \ufb02uctaciones (cambios\nde temperatura, vibraciones), a cambio de una p \u00b4erdida de e\ufb01ciencia. Por otra parte, la\nintroducci \u00b4on de divisor de haz genera hasta dos rayos secundarios que utilizamos para\nobtener una imagen del detector y el l \u00b4aser en tiempo real, as \u00b4\u0131 como monitorizar la potencia\n\u00b4optica sobre el detector en todo momento. Se halla una correlaci \u00b4on linear entre el ritmo\nde cuentas y la potencia \u00b4optica, justi\ufb01cando que obtener datos simult \u00b4aneos de estas dos\nmagnitudes mejora la precisi \u00b4on del proceso de ajuste tomogr \u00b4a\ufb01co.\nObtener una saturaci \u00b4on del ritmo de cuentas, as \u00b4\u0131 como identi\ufb01car regiones donde los\neventos de multi-fot \u00b4on sean dominantes, son los siguientes pasos en esta investigaci \u00b4on.\nEsto nos permitir \u00b4a aplicar e\ufb01cientemente la t \u00b4ecnica tomogr \u00b4a\ufb01ca sobre este nanodetector\nsuperconductor de MoSi, obteniendo todos los par \u00b4ametros\u0011ypique caracterizan la re-\nspuesta del detector de fot \u00b4on\u00b4unico.\n344 Conclusions\nIn this thesis, we studied a Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detector made out\nof MoSi, an amorphous superconductor. We characterized the superconducting proper-\nties of the 150 nm wide detector, which has a critical superconducting temperature of\nTc= 4:98K. The obtained critical current at 0 Kelvin for this detector is Ic(0) = 30:91\u0016A.\nThe measured I-V curves of the MoSi nanodetector are similar to those of the NbN nan-\nodetector. The latter shows a wider superconducting range, related to the higher critical\ntemperature Tcand critical current Icof NbN. In both cases, increasing the temperature de-\ncreases the superconducting range and makes the transition to the normal state less sharp.\nFor the count rate as a function of bias current, we found qualitative differences with pre-\nvious results reported by Caloz et al, as an universal saturation of the count rate was not\nfound. Still, it is desirable to achieve higher total count rates as well as probing a wider\nrange of wavelengths with this MoSi nanodetector. The critical current at base temperature\nT= 3:35KwasIc= 6\u0016Aand the maximum count rate achieved was 6 MHz, below the\nexpected saturation at 20 MHz. The rate of dark counts appeared to be lower for Mosi than\nfor NbN, as well as presenting a different spread for low bias currents.\nSo far, multi-photon events have not been recorded reliably, making tomography in the\nMoSi detector not possible. This was not expected, and further investigation is required\nto characterize the full response of this single photon detector. Lastly, two improvements\nwere implemented in the setup, in order to enhance tomography. A linear correlation be-\ntween measured count rate and measured power was found, providing an opportunity to\nenhance the accuracy of the tomographic routine. Increasing the beam size (at the cost\nof coupling ef\ufb01ciency) allowed us to counteract external \ufb02uctuations such as temperature\nchanges or vibrations. Obtaining a clear saturation of the count rate, as well as observing\nmulti-photon events will allow us to better obtain the values of piand\u0011and perform to-\nmography on MoSi. This will characterize the intrinsic response of the detector, a key step\nin understanding the physycal process behind photon detection with these devices.\n35365 Appendix\nUncertainty in the measurements, limiting magnitude\nIn this experiment, we measure different magnitudes such as power, temperature, cur-\nrent,etc... We brie\ufb02y give values for the relative uncertainty of these measurements, in\norder to identify which is the main source of error in the setup, and to possibly improve the\nexperiment and enhance the overall accuracy of the data.\nTemperature: We expect the temperature values to \ufb02uctuate because the vacuum and\ncooling systems are non-ideal. The variations in temperature are reduced if the system is\nstabilized at the base temperature (3.35 K):\nT= 3:35\u00060:02K (10)\namounting to a 0.6 % relative uncertainty in temperature. This data was taken over a 16\nhour long measurement, proving that our cryostat and cooling system are stable over time.\nBias Current: The uncertainty in bias current arises from the instrument precision of\nthe voltage source (Yokogawa). Operating this device in the proper range, we have an\nexperimental uncertainty of 10\u00005mV corresponding to the last digit we can read off this\nvoltage source. We will treat this uncertainty as \ufb02uctuations in current (noise) and ignore\nthe uncertainty in the value of the 100 \nresistor. Therefore, our uncertainty in the bias\ncurrent through the detector is:\nIb= 15\u0016A\u000610\u00002\u0016A (11)\nIn the cryostat, there\u2019s a temperature gradient between the outside environment and\nthe heat shields (3 K and 50 K shields). This introduces a thermal voltage offset, that is\nconsidered to be constant for small temperature changes. All our experiments were done\nin the 3-10 K temperature range. We \ufb01nd this value of thermal voltage offset by looking at\nthe I-V curves and their asimmetry around the point (0,0). The experimental value for this\noffset isVoffset = 1:21mV.\nOptical Power: This laser (and every non-ideal light source) presents some \ufb02uctuations\nin the intensity of the light. We measure this in the statistics mode of our power meter for a\nmoderate power level and a long timescale (14 hours). We expect the power \ufb02uctuations to\nhave a gaussian spread around a mean power, as predicted by the theory of coherent states\nin quantum optics. The shot noise, i.e. minimum standard deviation attainable, is given byp\nN, where N is the number of photons per pulse corresponding to our mean power ( 40\n\u0016W). After applying the transformation from power to mean number of photons per pulse,\n37Figure 5.1: Histogram of the power \ufb02uctuations in our power meter, showing a gaussian\ndistribution. Data was taken over 14 hours\nwe obtain a shot noise of \u001bSN= 14.3 nW. The experimental data presents larger variations,\nshown in Figure 5.1.\nP= 40:144\u00060:298\u0016W (12)\n\u001bP= 20:84\u001bSN (13)\nThe relative \ufb02uctuations in power were found to be around 0.7 % of the power.\nCount Rate: The photon counting process is also of statistical nature. Every time a\nphoton is absorbed by the detector, we can \u2019roll a dice\u2019 to determine if it is detected or not.\nThis process is repeated \ntimes per second, where \nis the repetition rate of the laser.\nTherefore, the count rate can be modelled as a binomial counting process.\nWe obtain the error in the count rate \ufb01xating the angle (therefore \ufb01xating the mean\npower) and recording the count rate for 10 seconds in each point. In this way we \ufb01nd a\nrelation between the standard deviation in count rate versus bias current shown in Figure\n5.2. We can also compute the standard deviation of the count rate versus the mean count\nrate at each point.\n38Figure 5.2: Normalized standard deviation of the count rate. The \ufb02uctuations were inte-\ngrated over 10 seconds for each point. Graph provided by E. Abeln.\nInstead of a binomial statistical spread, we \ufb01nd a linear increase in the error that is\nproportional to the count rate. For a binomial process, the uncertainty should decrease for\nhigher count rates. Instead, we observe an uncertainty that increases as we reach higher\ncount rates. This will be helpful to model the error when adding noise to the tomographic\ncode.\nCR= 6MHz\u000630KHz = 6MHz\u00060:5 % (14)\nThe normalized standard deviation (divided by the count rate value), has a constant\nvalue around 0.5 % of the count rate. This will help us modelling the error in the count\nrate, when testing the robustness of our Tomography code.\n39Model selection in tomography\nThe procedure can be really demanding when working with a non-ideal detector, so we\nwill use a modi\ufb01ed technique introducing \u0011as a linear loss (ratio between input photons\nand absorbed photons) in the tomographic function depicted below. Grouping linear losses\ninto one parameter , \u0011, will signi\ufb01cantly reduce the number of probabilities, pi, we need\nto evaluate, making the problem much easier and \u201dcheaper\u201d in computation time. This\nmethod has proven to be successful in these intrinsically inef\ufb01cient detectors [35, 36]\nRclick(N) = 1\u0000e\u0000\u0011NmX\ni=0(1\u0000pi)(\u0011N)i\ni!(15)\nWe also have to introduce some assumptions to ease the \ufb01tting of our data. We will assume\nthat above a certain index k, every probability pigoes to one ( pk= 1fork>m ). It\u2019s worth\nnoting that we de\ufb01ne p0= 0, so that dark counts are not regarded as 0-photon events. This\ncan be justi\ufb01ed by the fact that the dark count rate is independent of the laser repetition rate\n\n, and therefore it can not be expressed as a probability per pulse. This QDT method does\nnot make any assumption on how the detector works, but still characterizes its response\ncompletely. We will use Equation 2.8 for computing the click probabilty of our detector.\nThis protocol is a modi\ufb01cation of the tomographic procedures designed to handle low\nef\ufb01ciency detectors. The method regards absorbed photons \u0011Ninstead of input photons\nN. This dramatically reduces the number of \ufb01t parameters needed for systems with low\nef\ufb01ciency, i.e. a small value of \u0011. Here, we outline how we compute the tomographic\nmeasurements, and what we mean by an i-photon regime .\nFirst, we record the count rate Riand dark count rate Diduring tseconds as a function\nof the optical power Pi. From this data, we also get the standard deviation of both these\nmagnitudes \u001bD;iand\u001bR;i. Next, we compute the click probability riby subtracting the dark\ncounts from the count rate, and also normalizing to the laser repetition rate \n.\nri=Ri\u0000Di\n\n(16)\nOur experimental standard deviation is the normalized modulus of the standard devia-\ntions of both the count rate and the dark count rate:\n\u001bi=q\n\u001b2\nR;i+\u001b2\nD;i\n\n(17)\nWe compare the obtained \u001biwith the theoretical expected deviation of a binomial dis-\ntribution. For a random process that is attempted \nt times, with a probability pof success\n40and probability q= 1\u0000pof failure, we \ufb01nd a theoretical deviation of:\n\u001b0\ni=p\nri(1\u0000ri)p\n\nt(18)\nwhere t is the time used to collect all counts.\nAs a \ufb01nal step, we convert our optical power data Pito mean number of photons per\npulse using Equation 19\nNi=Pi\u0015\n\nhc(19)\nwhere\u0015is the wavelength in use, his Planck\u2019s constant and cis the speed of light\nFor the tomography, we evaluate the \ufb01t of Equation 2.1 and the goodness of the \ufb01t by\nevaluation the minimum value of the least squares. The click probability depends on the\nabsorption ef\ufb01ciency \u0011, the mean number of photons Niand an index K, where all proba-\nbilitiesp1;:::;pKare all smaller than one, while pK+1;pK+2;:::are equal to one. Therefore,\nK indicates which of the probabilities pk=p1;p2;p3;:::;1are going to have a contribution\nin the detection events, and which will be set to one (see Section 2.3)\nTo \ufb01t our data we de\ufb01ne the least-squares method as:\n\u001f2(K) =X\ni(ri\u0000p(Ni;\u0011;fpkg)2\n\u001b2\ni(20)\nObviously, a model that minimizes \u001f2is desired. At the same time we want to make\nsure we are not over\ufb01tting. In theory, by increasing K, we will always reduce \u001f2(K)at the\ncost of introducing parameters that may be physically irrelevant. To avoid this issue, we\napply model selection through the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) that penalizes the\n\u001f2(K)values depending on the number of \ufb01t parameters K.\nAIC =m\u00002jln\u001f2(K) = (K+ 1)\u00002jln\u001f2(K) (21)\nwhere m is the number of \ufb01t parameters (K+1 in our case) and j is the number of data\npoints (of the shape ( Ni,ri)).\nInstead of minimizing \u001f2(K), the quantity AIC is minimized to \ufb01nd an optimum choice\nfor K and the value of \u001f2(K)for that model. It is worth noting that this information criteria\nonly compares the relative goodness of the models, it does not reveal if we are comparing\ngood or bad models for our data.\n41The effect of noise on the process of tomography\nThe tomographic \ufb01tting is a multi-dimensional non-linear optimization problem, so the\neffect of different errors is not straightforward. We test the stability of the procedure, by\nintroducing noise in the count rate. The uncertainty in the optical power will only rescale\nthe power axis, but it does not affect the tomography code. Therefore, an error in the count\nrate is introduced, based on the experimental results of Figure 5.2.\nThe procedure is the following: we create dummy data using Equation 15 and setting\nvalues for\u0011andp1. To add noise, we follow the result from Figure 5.2 and add a linear\nerror to the values Riin the dummy data. This function is shown in Figure 5.3, where ris\na random number drawn from a normal distribution. Then, this modi\ufb01ed data is introduced\nin the tomography code and we hope to \ufb01nd back the p1previously set. This tomography\ncode also requires an initial value for p1. If we guess p1too accurately, the code will always\nbe successful so we choose the guess for p1to be a random number rbetween zero and\none. Compared to experimental data, the test data we created has the advantage of knowing\nthe correct value for all pibeforehand, so we can quantify the error and any possible bias\nof the tomographic procedure.\nFigure 5.3: Tomography feedback when adding linear noise in the count rate. Estimated\nvalues ofp1are plotted vs. the previously set values, \ufb01nding a near perfect correlation.\nGraph provided by E. Abeln.\n42Figure 5.3 shows the retrieved values of p1versus the set values in the test data. The\nchosen linear error corresponds to 1% of the total count rate, two times the relative error\nfound on Figure 5.2. This shows demonstrates the tomography \ufb01tting routine and the model\nselection are robust for the level of uncertainty present in the experimental results.\n43Acknowledgments\nI would like to thank the University of Leiden and the Quantum Optics group for receiving\nme and helping me develop my scienti\ufb01c skills.
