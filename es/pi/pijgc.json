Ludwig, DO\nMedicina interna\nLocations\nSCL Health Medical Group - Midtown\nAcerca de Jacob P. Ludwig\nDr. Ludwig is enthusiastic and detail-oriented in caring exclusively for adult patients. He believes in developing a strong patient-physician relationship through honest communication, good listening, and a holistic, multimodality approach to treatment. He is passionate about helping patients find and recognize their health, rather than simply focusing on disease treatment and prevention. Dr. Ludwig has a broad wellness focus that includes the importance of a healthy diet based around plants, laughter and fun, sunshine and fitness, friendship and community, work-life balance, positive reinforcement, mindfulness based stress reduction, and resilience strategies.\nWhat a potential patient should know about Dr. Ludwig is that he will spend the time to really get to know you, will help you find health in body, mind, and spirit, and is well-versed in both internal medicine and a holistic approach healing. Dr. Ludwig is board certified in internal medicine and fellowship trained in osteopathic medicine. Therefore he frequently uses his highly trained hands-on approach to diagnose and treat patients without the need for additional tests, medications, or specialists, but also can differentiate when tests, medications, and specialists can be truly helpful.\nDr. Ludwig\u2019s philosophy of care statement: No person or problem is too complex or too hopeless, and \u201cTo find health should be the object of the doctor. Anyone can find disease\u201d \u2013 A.T. Still, MD, DO (Founder of osteopathic medicine, c. 1899).\nDr. Ludwig has been in Colorado since starting medical school at Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine in July of 2010. There he earned his Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree, and completed a fellowship in osteopathic manipulative medicine, graduating in 2015. While in medical school he also earned a Master of Business Administration in Healthcare Administration degree from Jones International University. In the summer of 2018, Dr. Ludwig completed his internal medicine residency at National Jewish Health - Saint Joseph Hospital in Denver and was board certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine. He remained with the residency program for an additional year as the Chief Medical Resident during which time he served as a resident advocate, administrator, ambassador, educator and liaison between the faculty and residents. He also worked as an academic hospitalist caring for underserved, uninsured, and undocumented hospitalized patients. As the chief resident, Dr. Ludwig significantly expanded and individualized the wellness curriculum for the internal medicine residents.\nOriginally from Minnesota, Dr. Ludwig is married to his high school sweetheart and together they have three beautiful daughters. When not working, Dr. Ludwig enjoys spending time with his family, which often includes exploring Denver and the Colorado outdoors, playing with his daughters and often pretending to be any number of different Disney princes depending on the imaginary play of the day, and spending time with his wife exercising, relaxing, and cooking.\nDr. Ludwig remains an active member of the Saint Joseph Hospital ethics committee and regularly serves as an ethics consultant. As an educator, Dr. Ludwig remains involved with the residency program teaching residents and medical students, and also serves as an adjunct faculty member in the osteopathic principles and practices department at Rocky Vista University in Parker, Colorado. He was previously clinical faculty with the University Of Colorado School Of Medicine.\nEducaci\u00f3n y entrenamiento\nEntrenamientos\nSt. Joseph Hospital\nResidency, Internal Medicine, 2018\nRocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine\nMedical School, 2015\nCertificaciones\n-\nAmerican Board of Internal Medicine, 2018\nCalificaciones y opiniones\nOur patient satisfaction surveys, conducted by the independent research firm Press Ganey, present a thorough and accurate picture for patients and their families.
