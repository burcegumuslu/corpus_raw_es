There are other steps you can take to help keep you and your family healthy all flu season long.\nBut first, can we take a minute to say \u201cthank you\u201d to our immune systems? Your immune system is your body\u2019s way of fending off all the nasty germs the world throws at you every day. Unfortunately, a variety of lifestyle factors and unhealthy habits can keep your immune system from operating at full capacity, leaving you susceptible to infections like the flu.\nYou\u2019d be surprised how much your daily decisions impact your body\u2019s ability to fight off infection. Make these healthy habits part of your everyday routine to help keep your immune system functioning at its highest level.\n1. Feed your immune system with the right nutrients.\nObviously, your diet impacts your overall health. So, it follows that eating a healthier diet helps keep your body operating as it should. To give your immune system an extra boost for flu prevention, make sure you prioritize a diet rich in vitamins and amino acids.\nAmino acids\nWhy amino acids? An appropriate intake of amino acids, carbohydrates and some fats improves your ability to make the proteins needed for immune system function. Think: antibodies and cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that help regulate your body\u2019s immune response by sending cells to fight infection.\nVitamins\nA diet rich in fruit and vegetables helps us get the right amount of vitamins and minerals. A multivitamin supplement should only be used if your diet is deficient in one of these areas. If you\u2019re worried about any deficiencies in your diet, talk to your doctor about whether vitamin supplementation is the right move for you.\nOtherwise, look to your diet as the source of these critical vitamins and minerals, including:\n- Vitamin E\n- Vitamin B6\n- Vitamin C\n- Vitamin D\n- Iron\n- Zinc\n2. Get a healthy amount of sleep.\nAdequate sleep is very important for immune system\nfunction. In general, adults need at least\n[seven hours of sleep](/blog/sleep-numbers-facts-figures-better-shut-eye/), and children and\nadolescents need [9-11 hours](/blog/sleep-recommendations-age-child-getting-enough-zzzzs/). I can\u2019t underemphasize the\nimportance of getting a healthy amount of sleep \u2014 for your general wellbeing\nand for flu prevention especially.\nWe are more susceptible to viruses like the flu and the common cold when our bodies are running on inadequate sleep. A week of sleep deprivation has actually been shown to reduce immune system responsiveness to the flu vaccine.\nSo, make sure you\u2019re not skimping on sleep this flu season.\nRelated:\n[What staying up late is doing to you]\n3. Make exercise a regular habit.\nRegular\n[exercise](/blog/why-its-time-to-redefine-how-we-think-about-exercise/) habits improve your overall\nhealth and therefore can reduce your risk of acute illness. Making time for\nregular physical activity also helps reduce [anxiety](/blog/how-to-talk-to-your-doctor-about-anxiety/), depression and risk of chronic illness, meaning your\nbody will be happier overall when you\u2019re getting in a healthy amount of\nactivity.\nImmune system reactivity is actually slightly lower\nimmediately following exercise but improves afterward. This is not surprising\nsince exercise itself is a temporary stress on the body \u2014 a good kind of\nstress. Whether it\u2019s running, yoga, pilates or lifting weights,\n[get up and get moving](/blog/sit-less-move-more-5-ways-to-squeeze-more-physical-activity-into-your-day/)!\n4. Wash your hands.\nIt might sound like common sense, but\n[proper handwashing](/blog/the-abcs-of-proper-handwashing/) definitely reduces the risk\nof illness and infection. Some infections are spread by respiratory droplets,\nbut many others such as the common cold, influenza and norovirus can be spread\nby contact with surfaces or body fluids.\nSoap and water reduces the amount of these infectious\nagents on your hands. This is especially important for illnesses like norovirus\nand clostridium dificile (C. diff) bacteria, both of which cannot be destroyed\nby alcohol-based hand cleaners like\n[hand sanitizer](/blog/how-hand-sanitizer-stops-the-spread-of-school-germs/). However, soap and water\ndoes the trick for these infectious agents.\n5. Be smart and get a flu shot.\nThe most important precautionary measure you should take is getting the flu vaccine. Although vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season, it does provide you with a layer of protection and has been shown to reduce the severity of illness should you contract the flu.\nIf a family member or friend gets sick, encourage them to take precautions against spreading the illness to you and others around you. Wearing a mask can be helpful to reduce the spread of a respiratory illness from an infected individual. People infected with the flu should quarantine themselves by staying home during the illness.\nBe sure to clean commonly touched surfaces like door and appliance handles, faucets, toilets, etc. regularly to help keep any nasty germs at bay.\nWe make it easy.\nHealthcare doesn't have to be difficult. We're constantly finding ways to make it easy so that you can get Better and stay that way.\nBetter tools make it easier\nWe all have different healthcare needs.
