Related to this fact, in recent years, microbiological diagnostic techniques have appeared.

In this consensus statement, different experts and representatives of Spanish \nScientific Societies ( Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC), Spanish \nSociety of Neurology (SEN), Spanish Society of Immunology (SEI), Spanish Society of Pediatric Infectology (SEIP), Spanish Society of Rheumatology (SER), and Spanish Academy of Dermatology and \nVenereology (AEDV) review the epidemiology, clinical spectrum, diagnostic techniques available for the \ndiagnosis of infection by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, in addition to the therapeutic and prevention options of LB. In a consensual way, the recommend ations to establish the correct clinical and \nmicrobiological diagnosis are offered together with the recommendations to support the therapeutic management and prophylaxis of the infection.  \n \nKEY WORDS  \nLyme borreliosis,  Borrelia  burgdorferi  sensu  lato, Spain,  guidelines.  \n \nABBREVIATIONS  \nAAN: American Academy of Neurology ACA:  acrodermatitis  chronica atrophicans  \nAEDV:  Spanish Academy  of Dermatology  (AEDV) \nAV-B: atrioventricular conduction blocks  \nBID: one doses  every12h \nBmpA:  Borrelia  membrane  protein A \nBSK: Barbour -Stoenner -Kelly  \nCDC:  Centers  for Disease  Control  and Prevention \nCLIA: ChemiLuminiscence ImmunoAssay  \nCMV:  cytomegalovirus   \nCNS:  central  nervous  system \nCSF: cerebrospinal fluid  \nDbpA:  decorin- binding protein A \nDEBONEL:  Dermacent or-borne- Erythema -Necrosis -Lymphadenopaty \nDEET: N,N- diethyl -meta -toluamide  \nECG: electrocardiogram  \nEFNS:  European Federation of the Neurological  Societies \nEIA: enzyme immunoassay  \nELFA: enzyme linked fluorescent assay \nELISA:  enzyme- linked  immunosorbent  assay \nEM: erythema migrans  \nESCMID:  European  Society  of Clinical Microbiology  and Infectious  Diseases \nHIV: human immunodeficiency virus  \nIDSA:  Infectious  Diseases  Society  of America \nIFA: indirect immunofluorescence assay  \nIFA: indirect  immunofluorescence assay  \nIR3535:  ethyl -3-(N-n-butyl -N-acetyl)  aminopropionate \nKPM: Kelly -Pettenkofer medium  \nLA: Lyme arthritis LB: Lyme  borreliosis  \nMMIA:  Multiplexed Microbead ImmunoAssay \nN: numb er of subjects  \nND: not determined \nNK: natural killer  \nOD: one doses every 24h OLE:  oil of lemon  eucalyptus \nOsp: outer surface protein PCR:  polymerase  chain reaction \nPMD: p -menthane -3,8-diol \nPNS: peripherial nervous system \nPTLS:  post-treatment  Lyme  syndrome \ns.l.: sensu lato  \ns.s.: sensu  stricto  \nSEI: Spanish Society  of Immunology  \nSEIP:  Spanish Society  of Pediatric  Infectology \nSEN: Spanish Society of Neurology (SEN) \nSER: Spanish Society of Rheuma tology  \nSI: stimulation  index   \nTBD: tick -borne disease \nTID: one doses  every  8h \nVlsE:  variable lipoprotein surface -exposed  protein \nWB: western blot  \nWHO:  World  Health  Organization   \n1. INTRODUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE CONSENSUS  DOCUMENT  \nLyme disease or Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a complex multisystemic process predominantly distributed in \nthe northern  hemisphere,  transmitted  by the bite of hard ticks of the Ixodes  ricinus  complex  (Ixodes  ricinus , \nIxodes persulcatus, Ixodes scapularis, Ixodes pacificus ) and caused by different genospecies of Borrelia \nburgdorferi sensu lato (here after B. burgdorferi )1-3. In Europe, I. ricinus is the main vector2,3. \nMuch  of the clinical spectrum  of LB, such  as acrodermatitis  chronica atrophicans  (ACA),  erythema migrans \n(EM) and neurological manifestations including Garin and Boujadox meningopoliradiculitis, and the so - \ncalled Banwarth\u00b4s syndrome had already been described in Europe since the late XIX and early XX centuries. In  addition, its  bacterial  etiology  and tick transmission  had also been suspected. This  infection, \nhowever, aroused great medical and social interest as a result of the description in the US in the 70s\n4,5 \nand of the discovery  of its etiological  agent  in the 80s6, with gradual  increase in the description of patients \nuntil becoming the most frequent tick -borne disease (TBD) in the northern hemisphere7. \nThe diagnosis  of LB may be easy  in patients  bitten  by ticks,  who develop  the typical  clinical manifestations \nof the infection, such as EM, in an endemic area for LB. But, sometimes, and despite the fact that there are other  clinical manifestations  suggestive of LB (e.g. meningorradiculitis  and lymphocytic  meningitis  with \nfacial nerve paralysis), these manifestations may  be caused by other agents and processes, and a \nmicrobiological  confirmation is required\n2,8,9. To complicate  the diagnosis,  many  patients  do not remember \nthe tick bite, which can often go unnoticed because it is painless and in areas not accessible to sight. In \naddition, clinical reports of LB include nonspecific clinical manifestations such as prolonged asthenia, \nmyalgia,  arthralgia,  and lack of concentration,  among others,  that, taken  away  from the appropriate  clinical-  \nepidemiological environment, can lead to confusion and misdiagnosis.  \nFor many years, and this is still the case for most Public Network Centres in Spain, the microbiological criter ia recommended by Health  Agencies  and Scientific Societies  competent in the subject  (e.g. Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious \nDiseases (ESCMID), Infectious Diseases Society of America ( IDSA) and others) have been applied\n10-19. \nBut in recent  years,  \u2018other  techniques\u2019  that have  not been  validated  by these Agencies  and Societies  have \nappeared, leading to the diagnosis of LB in patients without clear epidemiological and clinical criteria. In \nthe opinion of many experts, and this is reflected in most clinical guidelines and consensus documents, \nmany of these  techniques have  only ori ginated confusion, without meeting the requirements  of sensitivity \nand specificity to establish a correct diagnosis of LB19-21. \nAnother problem, which adds difficulty to the diagnosis, is to differentiate an active infection from a past \ninfection, and the high prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi  in endemic areas22. To complicate \nthe issue,  the literature  includes  cases  of B. burgdorferi -infected patients  who do not develop a measurable \nhumoral immunity response, and patients with decreased levels of antibodies that may not be detected after an initial period of detection\n12,23. The culture  of B. burgdorferi  has also been described in patients  with \npersistent nonspecific clinical manifestations after having received adequate antimicrobial treatment for LB, although this is exceptional\n24.  \nFor the above- mentioned reasons and taking into account that every day it is more frequent that we are \nconsulted by patients w ho have been diagnosed of LB without meeting the required clinical - \nepidemiological and microbiological criteria and sometimes they are subjected to prolonged treatments \nnot based on scientific evidence, the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clini cal Microbiology \n(SEIMC) has considered the need to update and prepare a Consensus Document with other Scientific \nSocieties such as the Spanish Society of Neurology (SEN), Spanish Society of Pediatric Infectology \n(SEIP), Spanish Society of Rheumatology (SE R), Spanish Society of Immunology (SEI) and Spanish \nAcademy  of Dermatology  and Venereology  (AEDV)  involved in the diagnosis  and management  of the LB. \n \n2. METHODOLOGY  FOR  THE EVALUATION  OF THE DOCUMENT  \nAfter contacting with the different Spanish Scientific Societies and experts in the field, and with the aim \nalready proposed of agreeing on some useful  recommendations  for the management of patients  affected \nby LB, an exhaustive bibliographic search was pr oposed on the state of knowledge of the infection by B. \nburgdorferi s.l. and LB in PubMed. Given that the bibliographic search with the words \"Lyme disease\" or \n\"Lyme borreliosis\" or \" Borrelia burgdorferi \" retrieved more than 15,000 references, it was decided that \neach expert  would  narrow  the field and choose  the most  relevant  bibliographic  citations  taking into account \nprevious consensus documents and other recommendations of Health Agencies and Scientific Societies \nand relevant  abstract books  of Conferences.  As in Spain there are none  wide and updated reviews  of the \ntopic, it was also considered interesting to carry out an exhaustive review about the epidemiology and history of LB in Spain.  \nSince  available guidelines  and consensus  documents  have been  recently  published and they can be easily \nconsulted\n13-19, in our case,  we have chosen to use the degree  of consensus  between Societies  and experts\u2019 \nsignatories of this document for the final recommendations.  \n \n3. MICROBIOLOGICAL  CHARACTERISTICS  OF Borrelia burgdorferi  s.l. AND GENOSPECIES OF \nBorrelia burgdorferi  PRESENT  IN SPAIN \nBacteria of the genus Borrelia , along with the genera Spirochaeta, Cristispira and Treponema, fall within \nthe Phylum  XV Spirochaetes  phyl nov.,  Class  I Spirochaetia class.  nov.,  Order  I Spirochaetales  and Family \nI Spirochaetaceae,  and comprise  43 pathogenic  species  for birds  and mammals,  including humans.  They \nhave a characteristic spiral shape with size between 0.2 and 0.5 \u03bcm in diameter and between 3 and 33 \u03bcm in length.  They  have  an external  cell envelope,  a cytoplasmic  membrane,  periplasmic  flagella  (from  15 \nto 20) and a protoplasmic cylinder. The flagella fulfill the functions of skeleton and mobility and are \nsubproximally anchored in the bacterial body, and are located in the periplasmic space. They are Gram - \nnegative and microaerophilic bacteria. According to the analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and other \nconserved  genes  such  as the flagelline  gene,  and considering the ecological  characteristics,  Borrelia  spp. \nare divided into two large  groups, B. burgdorferi s.l. comprising the bacteria that cause  LB, and a second \nlarge group of bacteria that cause recurrent fever\n25.  \nA striking  feature of B. burgdorferi  s.l. is the small  size and structure  of its genome.  This is composed of a \nlinear chromosome, unusual in bacteria, of approximately 1 Mb and  several plasmids, linear and  circular, \nwhich  vary in number  up to 21. The guanine- cytosine ratio ranges  from 23% to 32%.  Another  characteristic \nis the large number of lipoproteins that it expresses, and that are mostly encoded by plasmids, such as \nthe 6 proteins  in the outer envelope (OspA  to OspF) and a variable  expression protein called  VlsE, which \nplay an important role in the pa tient's immune response. There is an absence of genes that encode \nproteins that lead to cellular biosynthesis reactions, which limits the metabolic capacity of B. burgdorferi \nand turns these bacteria into obligated parasites that depend on their hosts for their nutritional support. \nHowever, the borrelias of this group grow in a highly enriched liquid medium called Barbour -Stoenner - \nKelly (BSKII) at 30 -34 \u00b0C in microaerophilic environment, dividing every 8- 12 h during the logarithmic \nphase of their growth25. \nThe 5S -23S rRNA intergenic space has been used to classify closely related genospecies of the B. \nburgdorferi s.l. complex (Table 1). Although the complex currently comprises 21 different genospecies, \nonly B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia spielmanii, Borrelia garinii and Borrelia \nbavariensis are considered to be of pathogenic relevance to humans. Despite cases of LB caused by \nBorrelia  valaisiana,  Borrelia  lusitaniae,  and Borrelia  bissettiae have  been  described,  their pathogenic  ability \nhas been  questioned  and their description is  occasional. Borrelia  mayonii  has been recently  incorporated \nin the Americas26. \nThere seems to be a tropism of different genospecies by different organs associated with plasmid \nvariations.  Thus , B. afzelii  predominantly  appears  in dermatological  manifestations  such  as ACA,  B. garinii \nand B. bavariensis seem to present greater tropism by the nervous system, B. burgdorferi s.s. by the \narticular system, while B. spielmanii has been isolated exclusively from EM. Anyway, LB is a dynamic \nprocess with different clinical manifestations in different organs and systems, depending not only on \ngenospecies, but also on time2,3. \nThe concept of genospecies has generated controversy among various authors throughout history, and this has been greatly exacerbated in recent years. Some argue that genospecies are nothing more than \ngenetic variations of the same species, while others criticize that genetic classification is not relevant in \nmany cases  from an  ecological point of view. In 2014, Adeulu and Gupta proposed the reclassification of \nspirochaetals of the genus Borrelia , so that those that cause LB ( B. burgdorferi s.l. complex) would be \nrenamed \u2018 Borreliella\u2019, while those that cause recur rent fevers would continue with the name \u2018 Borrelia\u2019 , \nbased on the results of their analysis of genetic  markers \u2018unique\u2019 in the species\n27. Recently, detractors of \nthis new classification  have  asked  the Judicial  Commission  to support  the rejection  of the name  \u2018Borreliella\u2019 \nand all its combinations, based on the violation of several principles of the Code of International \nNomenclature of Prokaryotes, such as, among others: endangering human health and patient safety by the confusion they create in the medic al and scientific community and its possible consequences on \nmedical coverage, avoid unnecessary creation of new names and that names should not be changed without  sufficient  justified reasons\n28. This controversy  has led to the non-adoption of the new nomenclature   \nin most  published works  since its proposal, adding more  confusion to the chaos  that this has caused.  It is \ntherefore imperative that an appropriate taxonomic committee be involved in resolving this debate.  \n \nTable  1: Genospecies  of Borrelia  burgdorferi  sensu lato complex  \n \nGenospecies  Year Vector  Main  host Pathogenicit y \n for humans  Epidemiological \ndistribution \nB. afzelii  1994  I. ricinus  Micromammal\ns +++ Europe,  Asia \n \nB. americana  \n2010  I. persulcatus  \nI. ricinus   \nRodents,  birds   \n-  \nUSA \n \nCandidatus  B. andersonii   \n1995  I. minor  \nI. dentatus   \nCotton- tailed  \nrabbit   \n-  \nUSA \nB. bavariensis  \n \n \nB. bissettiae 2013  \n \n \n2016  I. ricinus  \nI. persulcatus  \nI. pacificus  Micromammal\ns, birds  \nNeotoma \nfuscipes  +++ \n \n \n+ Europe,  Asia \n \n \nUSA,  Europe \n \n \n \nB. burgdorferi  sensu  \n \n \n1984  I. spininpalpis \nI ricinus  \nI. scapularis  (dusky -footed \nwoodrat)  \nMammals,  \nbirds   \n \n \n+++  \n \n \nUSA,  Europe \nstricto   I. pacificus \nI ricinus  \nI. persulcatus     \nB. californiensis  \n \n \n \nB. carolinensis  2016  \n \n \n \n2011  I. jellisoni  \nI. spinipalipis  \nI. pacificus  \nI. minor  Dipodomys \ncalifornicus  \n \nPeromyscus  - \n \n \n \n- USA \n \n \n \nUSA \n \n \n \nB. chilensis   \n \n \n2014   \n \n \nI. stilesi gossypinus, \nNeotoma floridana \nOligoryzomys   \n \n \n-  \n \n \nChile  \n \nCandidatus  B.  \n2011   longicaudatus    \nfinlandensis  \nB. garinii   \n1992   \nI. ricinus   \nBirds   \n+++  \nEurope,  Asia \n \nB. japonica   \n1994/3 I. persulcatus  \nI. ovatus   \nRodents   \n-  \nJapan  \nB. kurtenbachii  2014  I. scapularis  Rodents  - USA & Europe \nB. lusitaniae  1997  I. ricinus  Lizards  + Europe   \n \nB. mayonii  2016  I. scapularis  \nI. pacificus  Mammals  ++ USA \nB. sinica  2001  I. ovatus  Niviventer  \nconfucianus  - China  \nB. spielmanii  2006  I. ricinus  \nI. persulcatus  Garden dormouse +++ Europe  \nB. tanukii  1997/6 I. tanuki  Vole - Japan  \nB. turdi 1997/6 I. turdus  Unknown  - Japan,  Europe  \nB. valaisiana  1997  I. ricinus  \nI. granulatus  \nI. columnae Birds  ?

EPIDEMIOLOGY,  DISTRIBUTION AND  FEATURES  OF Ixodes \nricinus \nThe first confirmed LB patients in Spain date back to the 1980s when the first cases of neuroborreliosis and EM were described\n29-31. Subsequently, other isolated cases were reported32-36, and small/medium \nseries of patients, either from collaborative studi es or from single centers, were published37-40, thus \nbroadening the spectrum of clinical manifestations and making clear that the LB is common in Spain, affecting children and adults of both genders. Most cases have been reported in the northern half of the \nIberian Peninsula.  \nIn addition  to the description of clinical cases, studies of seroprevalence of antibodies were carried out in \ndifferent  population  groups  showing that the infection  is frequent  in people  who develop outdoor  activities \n(hikers,  hunters,  fishermen,  environmental  workers  and others)  in which  antibodies  can be found in a high \npercentage.  The risk of infection also increases  with age. In fact, seroprevalence have ranged between 0- \n40% depending on the area, population and used technique\n22,41- 53 (Table 2).   \nHowever, since LB is not a notifiable disease in our country, we do not have records or reliable data on the incidence of this disease.  Most  patients  are diagnosed by physicians  in the event  of an EM or suspicion \nof clinical manifestations with nervous system involvement.  \nIn Europe, according to data from 2006 (latest WHO update), 85,000 cases are reported annually; these \nbeing clearly lower than the real data, as it is not a notifiable disease\n54. There are other estimations \nbetween 60,000 and more than 200,000 cases per year, only in Germany55. In Spain, there are no real \nincidence data.  \n \n \n \n  \nTable  2: Seroprevalence  of Borrelia  burgdorferi  infection  in humans  (Spain)  \n \nSeroprevalence  Population  type N Geographical  \narea  Method  Cut-off value  Ref. \n38% Foresters  and \nRangers  42 La Rioja  IFA \u2265 1/128  41 \n5.8%  \n31% Healthy population \nPeople bitten by ticks 500 \n38 La Rioja  IFA \u2265 1/128  22 \n29% \n10% \n1.3%  HIV infected  people  72  IFA \nEIA \nWB \u2265 1/128  42 \n13.1%  Healthy  population  298 Soria  IFA \u2265 1/256  43 \n16.4%  \n0% Suspected LB \nHealthy  population 354 \n150 Granada  WB  44 \n4.1%  Healthy  population  98 Le\u00f3n  IFA \u2265 1/128  45 \n25% Forestry workers,  \n117; veterinarians,  52; \nshepherds,  18; \napiculturists, 27; \nmushroom  and truffle \ngatherers, 74; other  \noutdoor  activities, 14 302 Vizcaya  EIA \nWB Negative  control  \n+3 SD 46 \n3.5%  Healthy  population  1825  Madrid  IFA  47 \n4.4%  Patients (adults and \nchildren)  admitted  to \nthe Hospital for \nsurgical intervention not related to an  \ninfection.  203 Barcelona  EIA  48 \n3.7%  Suspected  LB 936 Cartagena  EIA  49 \n4.4%  Healthy  population  1429  Navarra  EIA  50 \n9.6%  \n4.3%  Suspected  LB 623 Palencia,  \nBurgos  IFA \nWB \u2265256  51 \n13.2%  \n5.1%  \n16.2%  Healthy  population  \nBlood donors \nSuspected LB 1432  Asturias  EIA  52 \n7% Forest  rangers  100 Guadalajara  IFA IgG \u2265256  53 \nRef.: Reference; EIA: Enzimo- immuno- assay; IFA: indirect immunofluorescence assay; LB: Lyme borreliosis; N: \nnumber of subjects; WB: western blot.   \nAs previously stated, the vector of the B. burgdorferi s.l. infection and LB in Europe is I. ricinus . The first \nprevalence studies of B. burgdorferi in ticks were  carried out at the beginning of the 90s56,57 by means of \nimmunofluorescence techniques and later, by PCR. Table 3 details the different studies carried out, \nshowing very different prevalence depending on the area of Spain (0% to 48%), with higher prevalence when nymphs and adults are studied from the same area.

In 1998,  Oteo  et al. isolated \nthe first pathogenic B. burgdorferi strain in Spain, corresponding to B. garinii (RIOJA -1 strain), from a \npatient with an EM from La Rioja74, and given  the description of LB cases  with clinical manifestations  not- \ndefining of LB only based  on serological  findings  and without  clear  epidemiological  antecedents,  the \u201cLyme \nDisease  Study  Group  of the SEIMC\u201d  established a definition  of \u2018endemic area\u2019  to support  the diagnosis75.  \nIn Spain,  the number of  diagnosed cases  decreases  from North  to South  with areas  considered  endemic, \nsuch as La Rioja, Navarra, North of Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque Countr y and more \nrecently, Galicia, where in the last decade a progressive increase in the number of reported cases has \nbeen observed20,76- 78. \nAs already noted, in the Iberian Peninsula, as in the rest of Europe, LB is transmitted to humans by the bite of hard t icks of the genus Ixodes , and specifically by I. ricinus ( Figures 1- 3). \nFigure 1: Female Ixodes  ricinus  waiting  on the grass.  \n \n \n Figure 2 : Patient bitten by an adult female (A) and a nymph (B) of Ixodes ricinus. Note the concomitant \npresence of an erythema surrounding the tick caused by the local irritation of the tick saliva.  \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Different  sizes and stages  of Ixodes  ricinus.  \n \n \n \n \n \nThis species, particularly in its nymph stage, is the one that most frequently bites people in northern Spain\n79. I. ricinus  is the tick species  with the highest  bacterial  alpha- diversity  (species  richness)  within  the \nanthropophilic ticks from our environment80. In Spain, I. ricinus has been described not only as vector of  \nB. burgdorferi s.l. (mainly, B. garinii and B. afzelii) but also as vector of other human pathogenic \nmicroorganisms, such as Rickettsia monacensis81, Rickettsia helvetica64,82, Anaplasma \nphagocytophilum83,84, Neoehrlichia mikurensis85, Babesia spp.86,87, Borrelia miyamotoi66 and of other \nbacteria species  not implicated in human  pathology,  such  as the recent ly cultured Rickettsia  vini88. Despite  \nI. ricinus is the vector of the TBE virus, it has not been notified in Spain up to date89,90, and only imported \ncases have been detected.  \nI. ricinus is generally distributed in temperate deciduous forests and mixed forests with shrubs, thick \nundergrowth and a high degree of relative humidity (>80%). In figure 1, a female I. ricinus can be seen waiting  for a host.  In figure 3 the different  stages  of the tick and their sizes  are detailed.  They  prefer  areas \nwith litter cover on the ground that provide protection against drought in summer and cold in winter, creating  a humid  microclimate.  In rainy  areas,  it is easy  to find these  ticks in coniferous  forests  connected \nwith grasslands where there are extensively exploited livestock and abundant cervids that acts as dispersers  and amplifiers  as well as wild fauna (micromammals),  which  act as reservoirs\n91. They  can also \nlive in urban  and peri-urban environments.  In areas such  as La Rioja  or Navarra,  I. ricinus habitually  lives \nin areas with a  minimum altitude of 400  m and a  maximum of 1,200 -1,300  m. However, in western  areas \nwith the influence  of the Atlantic  Ocean and higher  humidity,  I. ricinus  can be found from sea level to 2,000 \nm of altitude.  In southern  Spain,  there  are also areas  where there are stable populations  of I. ricinus , such \nas the `Parque de los Alcornocales\u00b4 in Cadiz, and the \u2018Do\u00f1ana National Park\u201920,92. In the last decade, the \ndistribution of I. ricinus (and the pathogens it transmits) continues to expand northwards in latitude and \ntowards  higher altitude  areas  throughout Europe93-95. The shorter and  less severe winters  in recent  years \n \nappear to have contributed to a greater abundance of I. ricinus , parallel to an expansion of its reservoirs \nand hosts.  These  factors  and the phenomena  of contact  between ticks (co- feeding) seem  to be responsible \nfor the local variations  in the prevalence of the different  Borrelia  spp. (and other  microorganisms)  in ticks96. \nI. ricinus are mainly active from spring to autumn, although we can find them active throughout the year \ndepending on the factors  mentioned above.  Activity  in spring is usually  higher  than in autumn  (associated \nwith higher temperature and photoperiod) with  the exception of larvae, which show  the opposite situation \nin some areas92,97,98. \nOther species of ticks such as Ixodes hexagonus, Ixodes canisuga and Ixodes frontalis , contribute  to the \ncirculation of B. burgdorferi in Spain57, 65, although no cases of LB associated with their bites, which are \nrare in humans, have been reported.  \n \n5. CLINICAL  MANIFESTATIONS  OF LYME  BORRELIOSIS  \nIn most  patients  in whom  B. burgdorferi  causes  disease,  the clinical manifestations  follow a chronological \ncourse that can be related to the pathogenesis and pathophysiological changes caused by the causative \nbacteria. As it is a dynamic process over time, it has been classified into different phases or stages2 as \ndetailed in table 4.  \n \nTable  4: Classification  and main  clinical manifestations  of Lyme  borreliosis  \n \n \nPhase  Clinical  manifestations  \nEarly  localized  EM, lymphocytoma  with or without  lymphadenopathy  \nEarly  disseminated  EM multiple,  disseminated lymphocytoma  and/or  early neurologic,  \ncardiac  and musculoskeletal  manifestations.  Ophthalmic \nmanifestations.  \nLate ACA,  lymphocytoma,  late neuroborreliosis,  persistent  or relapsing  \narthritis  of more  than 6 months  \nEM: Erythema  migrans  ACA;  Acrodermatitis  chronica atrophicans.  \n \nIn this document, we have reviewed the state  of the knowledge of LB clinical manifestations  according to \nthe organ or system affected.  \n \n5.1. Skin  manifestations \nThe skin manifestations  are the most  frequent  and best documented,  and can appear  during all phases  of \nthe infection.  The first descriptions  date from the end of the 19th century  in Europe ( Acrodermatitis  chronica \natrophicans - Buchwald 1983)99 and the beginning of the 20th century (Erythema chronicum migrans - \nAfzelius 1909)100. Later, other mani festations such as lymphadenosis benigna cutis, now called \nlymphocytoma associated with B. burgdorferi, were added101. \n \n  \n \n5.1.1.  Erythema  migrans (EM) \nThe earliest and most typical clinical marker of LB in both, North America and Europe, is EM102,103. It is \ncharacterized by the development  of a small  erythematous  macule  at the point  of the tick bite, which  grows \nat the border  and typically  clarifies  in the center,  acquiring a targeted or annular  appearance (Figure 4A), \nalthough it can also sometimes take other more atypical forms ( Figures 4B and 4C ). \nFigure 4 : A) Typical erythema migrans (EM) with annular appearance on leg. B) Large EM of more than \n6 weeks of evolution. C) EM without the typical annular appearance. D) EM in the early disseminated phase with satellite lesions.  \n \n \nIf unrecognized and untreated,  it can grow  and become large,  losing  intensity  in the tonality  of the borders \n(Figure 4B ). It appears a few days to 2- 3 weeks after the bite and without treatment, it can take many \nweeks or months to disappear. This is the early localized phase of the infection. In some patients, the \nbacteria spread through t he skin through the lymphatic vessels and similar lesions or satellite plaques \nappear,  usually  smaller  in size, which  are sometimes  purpuric  in appearance (Figure  4D). This is what  we \ncall multiple  EM and corresponds  to the early  skin disseminated phase  of the B. burgdorferi  infection. EM \nis usually painless, although some patients report a certain stinging- itch in the area. The border of the \nlesion is usually sharp, unlike other cellulites. The  clinical presentation of  EM in children is similar than in \nadults, although EM is more commonly localized on the head or neck that in adults104. A variable \npercentage of patients with EM have arthromyalgia, low -grade fever and conjunctivitis55,103,104. The \npresence of fever  and severe  impairment  of the general  state,  with or without  other  clinical manifestations \nor changes in blood parameters, should alert us  to a possible co -infection by other agents  transmitted by  \nI. ricinus  (in our  media,  B. miyamotoi , A. phagocytophilum , N. mikurensis , Babesia spp., R. monacensis ). \nThe differential diagnosis of EM in our environment should be made with other annular erythemas and \nDEBONEL ( Dermacentor -borne -Erythema -Necrosis -Lymphadenopaty ), caused by R. slovaca or Ca. R. \n \nrioja,  since  when this infection  is located outside the head,  an EM-like appears  but with central  necrosis105 \n(Figure 5).  \n \nFigure 5 : Erythema migrans -like lesions with eschar in patients bitten by Dermacentor marginatus and \ncaused by Candidatus Rickettsia rioja (A) and Rickettsia slovaca (B) (DEBONEL).  \n \n In travelers  returning from certain US areas,  it can be very difficult  to distinguish  between EM and southern \ntick-associated rash illness (STARI)\n106. EM must be also differentiated from the skin reaction caused by \nthe tick -bite (saliva) ( Figure 2 ) and sometimes the substances used to remove the tick (liquid nitrogen) \ncan cause a reaction that may simulat e an EM (Figure 6). That is why we do not recommend this practice.  \n Figure 6: Erythema migrans -like lesion  after removing  a tick. A  day before, a  spray  of liquid  nitrogen  was \nused to freeze the tick.\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n5.1.2.  Lymphocytoma \nIn Central Europe, and associated with B. afzelii infection, and mainly in children, the so- called Borrelia \nlymphocytoma has also been described during the early localized pha se, and less frequently in the \ndisseminated phase. This rare manifestation is usually located on the earlobe, face, nipple or scrotum. It \nmanifests as a well -located plaque or as a painless bluish- red nodule at the point of the tick -bite or at a \ndistance t hat appears within weeks of contracting the infection. Microscopically, the architecture is made \nup of a dense lymphocytic infiltrate that must be differentiated from cutaneous lymphomas55. Although \ncommunicated, it is a rare skin manifestation in Spain107 (Figure 7).  \n \nFigure 7: Borrelial lymphocytoma.  \n \n \n5.1.3.  Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans  (ACA)  \nACA is another  cutaneous  manifestation in patients  with persistent  infection (late stage),  overall  in Central \nEurope and much less frequent in Spain ( Figure 8). In a large series recently published in Slovenia, \nauthors conclude that ACA is typically caused by B. afzelii (also other genospecies can be involved) and \nusually  affects  old women, although it can  be diagnosed in children.  Clinical presentation depends  on the \nduration of illness and probably on the Borrelia genospecies causing the disease108. It starts as a \nviolaceous patch, usually located on the extensor surface of a limb. Periarticular nodules and cords can  \nalso be present  (Figure 8). It progresses  slowly  without  treatment,  causing a skin atrophy,  which  will allow \nsee the vessels of the skin. ACA is accompanied by a polyneuropathy in up to 50% of cases55,109. \nThese three  manifestations  are clearly  related to an infection with B. burgdorferi . The relationship between \ninfection with B. burgdorferi and other dermatoses, especially morphea, lichen sclerosus, and interstitial \ngranulomatous dermatitis is still debated.  \n \nFigure 8: Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) affecting left hand (A) and left elbow (B) with an \nunderlying fibrous cord on the arm. ACA affecting low extremities (C) and an arm with a fibrotic nodule \n \n(D). \n \n5.2. Neurologic manifestations \nThe involvement  of the central  and peripheral  nervous  system (CNS  and PNS) in  B. burgdorferi  infection, \noccurs in approximately 15% of infected patients, particularly in the early disseminated phase of the \ninfection (weeks after the tick bite) and less often in later stages (2 -3% of infected patients)110-112. The \nneurological manifestations in Europe and the US appear to be different in some aspects113-115. \nLyme Neuroborreliosis is divided between early and late manifestations  (duration of  signs and symptoms \nfor more than 6 months), as well as between CNS and PNS manifestations.  \n \n5.2.1.  Early neuroborreliosis: The most common manifestations of early neuroborreliosis are cranial \nneuropathy (particularly facial palsy), lymphocytic meningitis, and radiculoneuritis, which can occur in \n \nisolation or in combination, and these are known as the Garin -Bujadoux -Bannwarth syndrome, although \nunfortunately  recent  literature only mentions  Bannwarth\u2019s  syndrome.  This condition occurs weeks  after the \nappearance of the typical skin lesion (EM) or the tick bite, and is characterized by a severe, migrating \nradicular pain that can be accompanied by peripheral nerve paresis, often combined with uni - or bilateral \n(one- third of cases) facial  palsy  and cerebrospinal  fluid (CSF)  pleocyt osis. Pain disappears  after antibiotic \ntreatment; however, the disorder spontaneously resolves in 5 to 6 months without therapy116. Patients \npresenting with facial palsy are commonly misdiagnosed as having Bell\u2019s palsy, and radiculitis may be mistaken for a herniated  disc. The presentation  in the periods  of activity  of I. ricinus  as well as a history  of \ntick exposure and a skin lesion compatible with an EM should alert to the clinicians.  \nTwo recent retrospective studies in Denmark and Germany showed that the most common neurological disorder was radiculitis, present in 66% and 50% of patients, respectively, facial palsy in 43% and 25%, and meningitis in 10% and 6%\n113,114. Aside from radiculitis, patients with early neuroborreliosis may also \nhave other  forms  of PNS involvement,  including plexopathies  and a more  disseminated polyneuropathy  or \nmononeuritis multiplex. In the US and Europe, facial palsy and lymphocytic meningitis are the most common  early  manifestations.  Headache is the main  complaint  in meningitis,  and fever  and meningismus \nmay be mild or absent.  In untreated patients,  recurre nt attacks  of meningitis  may alternate with periods  of \nremission. CSF analysis shows a moderate (around 100 cells/mm\n3) lymphocytic mononuclear cell \npleocytosis117 sometimes with atypical features, resembling lymphoma with moderate protein increase, \nand nor mal glucose contents35. \nOccasionally, patients may have a stroke, likely secondary to infective endarteritis, in a similar way as it occurs  in syphilis  or tuberculosis.  A few cases  of retrobulbar  optic  neuritis,  papillitis,  neuroretinitis  and \nischemic optic neuropathy have been reported. Papilledema secondary to raised intracranial pressure in Lyme meningitis occurs in children, with few adult cases reported\n111,112. \n \n5.2.2.  Late neuroborreliosis: This condition is much less common and may present as a peripheral \npolyneuropathy accompanying ACA, an almost exclusively European entity109. The neuropathy is \npredominantly sensory and tends to follow the topographical distribution of the skin disease.  \nLate CNS involvement may appear months to  years after the  disease  onset, and it was initially known as \nchronic  encephalomyelitis118. In addition to be very uncommon (less  than 2% of all Lyme  neuroborreliosis), \nit represents a controversial entity119-122. It is defined as continuous disease lasting more than 6 months \nand its diagnosis  can be only made in the presence of suggestive neurologic  symptoms, CSF pleocytosis, \nand intrathecal B. burgdorferi antibody production123. Patients complain of cerebral malfunctioning, \nparticularly  cognitive  problems,  or present  spinal  cord signs  and symptoms, including paraparesis,  ataxia, \nand bladder dysfunction. When there is CNS involvement, the CSF shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis (usually in hundreds  of cells/mm\n3), increased proteins and normal  glucose. More details are discussed in \nthe diagnosis section.  \n \n5.3 Musculoskeletal  manifestations \nMusculoskeletal  manifestations  in the context  of LB are frequent.  In fact, its importance  has been  reflected \nin the history of LB itself, which in the first descriptions in the US was called \u2018Lyme arthritis\u2019 (LA)5. The  \nprevalence of the joint and m usculoskeletal manifestations is more frequent depending on the \ngeographical area since the clinical spectrum is different between the American continent and Europe.  \n \n5.3.1.  Arthritis  \nIn Europe, oligoarticular arthritis and joint inflammation during the early dis seminated phase seem to be \nless frequent  than in the American continent,  and in late stages,  this arthritis  is rarely  resistant  to antibiotic \ntherapy and hardly related to autoimmune mechanisms. In the US, more than 10% of LA cases are \nresistant to treatment and associated to autoimmune mechanisms3,20,102. In Spain, reports of the classic \nform of LA are rare, probably related to the f act that B. garinii is the most frequent genospecies causing \nLB in Spain. Anyway, as  it occurs with the cutaneous  and neurological  manifestations  of LB,  in Spain it is \nmore  frequent  to diagnose this type of manifestations  in north- western regions20,124. According to data from \na recent  study  including patients  who underwent  serology  tests  and showed positive  results  in urban  areas, \nthe prevalence of LA was very low (6 cases out of 78 positive serologies from 574 samples)125. In the \nnatural  history of the  disease, up  to 45-62% of patients  with untreated  EM develop LA  characterized as  a \nmonoarthritis or oligoarthritis. LA can be  intermittent or persistent, frequently affecting the knee joint, \nalthough it can present as an asymmetric oligoarthritis1-5,125. \nIn a study  carried out from 2010 to 2016 in France,  Borrelia  was detected in 37 out of 357 (10.4%)  synovial \nfluids  tested by PCR.  Patients'  median age was 36 years  (range  6-78) with 61% of men and 28% patients \nunder 18. The  presentation was monoarticular in 92% and the knee was involved  in 97%. Contrary  to the \nBorrelia genospecies distribution in European ticks, B. burgdorferi s.s. was the most prevalent species \nfound in synovial fluid (54%) followed by B. azfelii (29%) and B. garinii (17%)127. In this series, despite \nproper antibiotic therapy, roughly one third of patients presented persistent inflammatory synovitis and a \nsmall proportion developed systemic  arthritis127. Apart  from the knee,  it can also affect  the shoulder,  ankle, \nelbow, temporo- mandibular joint or wrist. The association with bursitis or inflammatory tendinopathy is \nusual. Less frequently, it affects more than five joints, mainly large. Inflammatory episodes, that begin \nacutely, can  last from weeks to  months, being much more frequent in untreated patients. It is common to \npresent  arthritis  with clinical joint synovial  fluid effusion,  although  the inflammation  is not extremely  painful \nexcept for loaded and pressured joints or in over -weighted patients125. If the inflammation chronically \npersists in correctly treated patients (10%), the concept of post -infectious LA appears. It is characterized \nby proliferative  synovitis that persists \u22652 months  after oral antibiotics  or \u22651 month  after,  at least,  two weeks \nof intravenous antibiotics, which may lead to joint dysfunction due to cartilage erosions and j oint \nradiological progression. It is thought to be related to persistent immune activation rather than persistent \ninfection status  and is still discuss128. The study  of synovial  fluids  reveals  an inflammatory  process  with an \nelevation of the cell count  between 10,000- 25,000 cells/microL,  increase of proteins,  none specific,  neither \ndifferent from other infections.  \nThe differential  diagnosis  includes all  acute  and chronic inflammatory processes,  mainly  monoarticular or \noligoarticular,  due to infecti ous agents  and/or  inflammatory  and autoimmune diseases.  Previous  history  of \nEM helps to focus the clinical picture of such arthritis and seek for LB. The serological response to B. \nburgdorferi is the  main diagnostic test, but occasionally seroconversion does not occur until a few  weeks \nlater in cases of early disseminated infec tion. Patients with arthritis occurring in advanced stages of the  \ndisease are usually seropositive for antibodies to B. burgdorferi . \nThe outcome of patients with early LB covers from a stage of full recovery to the development of \nautoimmune arthritis such rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, within months of treatment, likely occurring in patients with unique risk factors (psoriasis), considering the infection a potential trigger to chronic stages\n129,130. In the aforementioned French series, despite proper therapy, 34% of patients \ndeveloped persistent synovitis for at least two months (median duration: 3 months, range 2 -16). Among \nthose,  three  patients  developed systemic inflammatory  oligo - or polyarthritis  in previously  unaffected joints \nwith no sig ns of persistent infection  (repeated PCR  testing negative),  which mandated disease -modifying \nanti-rheumatic drugs introduction, leading to remission127. \nMoreover,  the presence of musculoskeletal  manifestations  of migratory  type or recurrent  arthralgia  is very \nfrequent in early stages (50- 75%), and they are also present in patients in late stages of the infection14. \nThey  are unspecific,  overlapping through the infectious  disease course.  Therefore,  in the absence of other \ntypical  manifestations  of the disease such as EM or meningoradiculitis,  the presence of isolated  arthralgias \nshould not justify the investigation of LB (Consenus level: 9/9) \n5.4 Cardiological  manifestations \nCardiological  manifestations  in the context  of LB can be observed  in the early  disseminated  and late stages \nof infection, although their communication is much less frequent than skin, neurological or joint manifestations. This is because, in most cases, B. burgdorferi only causes self -limited atrioventricular  \nconduction blocks (AV -B) that do not cause clinical manifestations or do so temporarily. According  to the \nCDC, involvement occurs in only 1.1% of reported LB cases and it is more common in men in USA\n131, \nalthough a study carried out in New York city with children suffering LB without symptoms of carditis, showed electrocardiographic  alterations  in up to 29%,  most  frequently  AV-B grade I\n132. In Germany,  it can \nbe found in up  to 10% of patients133. There  are no data of prevalence in Spain, although  members  of this \npanel have observed asymptomatic AV -B in patients with early localized and disseminated forms of LB. \nAnyway, according to current opinion, there is acute, self -limiting Lyme carditis, and persistent Lyme \ncarditis. Acute Lyme carditis mostly manifests as transient conduction disorders of the heart (e.g. AV -B I \nto III) or supraventricular  and ventricular  rhythm  disturbances,  pericarditis,  myocarditis,  and pancarditis  in \nsingle cases that can be cause of  cardiac failure and sudden death134. Usually these patients \nspontaneously  recover  within  3 to 7 days  and thus,  permanent  pacemakers  are not needed.  Other  authors \nreported that myocarditis is relatively frequent135,136. \nPersistent Lyme carditis is defined as a case of chronic heart failure confirmed by positive serology and endomyocardial biopsy. Tick -bites or EM are not always reported. Seropositivity and control of its \nspecificity by western -blot (WB) are indicative but  no an etiological proof. Even histological detection of \nspirochetes in endomyocardial tissue or cultivation of borrelia from endomyocardial biopsy are not final etiological proofs of the respective cardiac disorder. Those findings, however, are an indication for antibiotic treatment\n137. \nAccording to the recently  published American  guidelines19, ECG  should only be performed  in patients  with \nsigns or symptoms consistent with cardiac involvement in the context of LB, including dyspnea, edema, \npalpitations, lightheadedness, chest pain and syncope (Consensus level: 9/9)  \n  \n5.5. Other  clinical  manifestations \nThe development  of other  clinical manifestations  accompanying  the typical  clinical manifestations  of LB is \nrelatively frequent.  \n \n5.5.1.  Ophthalmic manifestations \nOphthalmic  manifestations  may occur  in every  stage of the disease.  Conjunctivitis  and episcleritis  are the \nmost  frequent  manifestations  in early  localized  stage.  Neuro- ophthalmic  disorders  and uveitis  occur in the \nearly disseminated stage, whereas keratitis, chronic intraocular inflammation and orbital myositis have \nbeen reported in the persistent stage of borreliosis138. In some cases, these ophthalmological \nmanifestations may also be due to a Jarisch- Herxheimer -type reaction139. These ophthalmological \nmanifestations  are not specific  of LB, and they do not require investigation of B. burgdorferi  infection \nwithout a clear clinical- epidemiological history or out of the  context of LB, since a positive result could be \nequivocal.  \n \n5.5.2 Psychiatric manifestations \nAlthough psychiatric disorders may coexist in the course of LB, there is no recommendation to request \nmicrobiological tests to determine the state of infection by B. burgdorferi in patients  with such disorders if \nthey do not present other clinical manifestations suggestive of LB. The same occurs in children with \nattention deficits19. We refer the readers  to the excellent  and exhaustive reviews  about  LB previously  cited \nherein, which mention other manifestations that may accompany the wide spectrum of clinical \nmanifestations of B. burgdorferi infection3,102. \n \n5.5.3.  Congenital  Lyme  disease  \nVertical  transmission of B. burgdorferi  is a proven fact, although  there  are controversies  regarding the risk \nof transmission and effects  on delivery  and fetus140. In 2018,  Waddel  et al. performed a systematic review \nof gestational LB and 59 cases were identified from 1969 to 2017141. Twelve cases were associated to \nmiscarriage or fetal death;  eight  cases, with newborn  death;  and 16, with other  post-delivery  abnormalities, \nincluding syndactyly, respiratory distress and hyperbilirubinemia. One case described complete features of clinical and laboratory results consistent with vertical transmission of LB. They also summarized eight epidemiological  studies  compar ing features  or serology  from pregnant  women  in endemic  areas  with non- \nLyme pregnancies. The authors concluded that there was no association between gestational LB or surrogate measures of exposure and adverse birth outcomes. A meta- analysis of nine studies showed \nsignificantly fewer adverse birth outcomes in women treated for gestational LB compared to those who untreated during pregnancy, providing indirect evidence of association between gestational LB and \nadverse birth outcomes. Other risk factors investigated, such as trimester of exposure, acute vs. \ndisseminated LB at diagnosis, and symptomatic  LB vs. seropositive women with no LB symptoms during \npregnancy were not significantly associated with adverse birth outcomes\n141. \n \n \n \n \n  \n5.6 Post -treatment  Lyme syndrome  (PTLS)  \nPatients  diagnosed  of LB and correctly  treated  usually  have a full recovery.  Anyway,  persistent  neurologic \ndeficits,  such as facial  paralysis  or persistent  pain can be observed in a low percentage  of treated patients. \nTime to recovery can be longer in patients with late stages also. These facts should not be confounded \nwith PTLS.  \nPTLS has been defined as persistent symptoms without objective manifestations that persist for at least six months after conventional treatment for LB has been completed\n142. These patients usually refer \nnonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, or perceived cognitive impairment. These symptoms should not be attributed to persistent active infection. In this context, s erological tests should \nnot be used as proofs  of efficacy  of the treatment  since despite the fact that antibody  titres  usually  decrease \nafter treatment,  patients  can remain  seropositive for years  and this fact does  not mean  active  infection\n12,143. \nIf these symptoms persist after adequate treatment, several controlled studies have shown that immunocompetent patients do not benefit from retreatment or prolonged treatment\n19,144 -146. In these \npatients, other possible causes of disease that justify the persistence of clinical manifestations should be sought (Consensus level: 9/9). \n\u2018Chronic Lyme Disease\u2019 is a term that creates great confusion and it is often used by some doctors and \npatients\n147. Most Health Agencies and Scientific Societies are against the use of this term, which is \ncommonly used to define patients with nonspecific and persistent symptoms in whom no active infection is demonstrated, and even, in many cases, they never have had B. burgdorferi infection confirmed with tests  recommended in this and other  guidelines  for the diagnosis  of B. burgdorferi  infection.  These patients \nmust  be differentiated from patients  with clinical manifestations  of the late phase of LB with evidence  of B. \nburgdorferi infection, and from patients with PTLS (Consensus level: 9/9).  \n \n6. DIAGNOSIS  OF Borrelia  burgdorferi  s.l. INFECTION  AND LYME  BORRELIOSIS  \n \n \n6.1. Direct  diagnoses \nThe accurate microbiological diagnosis of B. burgdorferi infection and LB is based on the demonstration \nof the presence of the agent  in different  biological  samples  by culture  and/or  visualization  of B. burgdorferi \nin the affected tissues. These techniques require great technical and time -consuming dedication as  well \nas trained staff and continuous quality controls, so they are usually only available in specialized \nlaboratories. In addition, the culture is mainly sensitive in the early phase of the disease, in which the diagnosis is based on the epidemiological  history  and clinical manifestations. As  the infection progresses \nover time and other  organs  and systems are affected,  the sensitivity  decreases.  There are different  culture \nmedia -usually liquid -, with incubations between 30- 35\u00baC up to 12 weeks and in microaerophilia, such as \nthe Barbour -Stoenner -Kelly (BSK) and its modifications, such as BSK -II or BSK- H, or the modified Kelly - \nPettenkofer medium (KPM)\n148-150. However, this technique only has a high performance in skin samples \n(biopsies of ACA and EM)151, decreasing its sensitivity when performed in sterile fluids such as CSF or \nsynovial  fluid in the early  disseminated phase (eg: acute meningorradiculitis  and arthritis ), and even more \nin the late stages of the disease (e.g. persistent neurological syndromes). Regarding the visualization of  \nB. burgdorferi  s.l., the lack of specific  antibodies  for the development  of immunohistochemistry  techniques  \nalso limits their use, a lthough there are specific stains to demonstrate the presence of spirochetes in \ntissues  (Warthin -Starry,  modified Dieterle  or modified Steiner  silver  stains)152-154. For all these reasons,  the \ndirect diagnosis  is mainly based on molecular biology techniques (PCR assays in their different versions: \nconventional, real -time, isothermal, etc.). Their sensitivity at least overlaps with that of culture \ntechniques155. They are faster, more affordable, and also allow us know the involved genospecies. \nNevertheless, molecular tests are not standardized and partial fragments of a variety of chromosomal \ngenes,  such as fla, p66, 16S rRNA  or plasmid -borne genes,  such as ospA , ospB , VlsE or the 5S/23S  rRNA \nintergenic spacer region can be used as PCR targets. It is worth -noting that plasmid- borne genes may \nyield false positive results since borrelias are able to shed blebs containing plasmids  that dissociate from  \nbacteria and may persist in tissues and body -fluids without active disease156. Therefore, detection based \non chromosomal  genes  is recommended.  Since  their sensitivity  can be lower,  the use of two target  genes \nis recommended10. Molecular detection of B. burgdorferi should be also performed with appropriate \nsamples (e.g. blood and urine are not suitable materials for diagnosis)157 and in specialized laboratories. \nPCR assays are useful in patients with skin manifestations, especially with EM, where the sensitivity is around 70%, according to a meta -analysis conducted by Ru\u017ei\u0107 -Sablji\u0107 and Cerar (2017), with a better \nprofitability  in skin biopsies  from ACA patients,  where the diagnostic  sensitivity  reaches  75%\n158. However, \nmolecular assays are not worthy in cases of EM since this skin manifestation is very specific and highly suggestive of LB. Synovial fluid is considered a valuable sample for the diagnosis of LA by PCR, with median sensitivity of 77.5%. It decreases up to 22.5% for CSF in neuroborreliosis, and it is 18% or even lower for blood, serum or plasma samples\n158. A negative PCR result does not exclude the possibility of \nLB. The sample should be quickly processed in the laboratory under optimized conditions (4- 8\u00baC in less \nthan 24 hours  after the extraction)  to obtain the highest  yield for Borrelia  detection10. Sensitivity  of samples \nfixed in paraffin or kept for longer periods of time is reduced when compared with that of fresh or fresh/frozen specimens\n159. The specificity of positive results must be confirmed by identification up to \ngenospecies level  to reduce contamination risks. We recommend  the use of molecular diagnostic  tests in \ncases of suspicion of neuroborreliosis with CSF, ACA with skin biopsies and LA with synovial fluids, and always performed by specialized laboratories. (Consensus level: 9/9)  \n \n6.2. Indirect  diagnoses \nDue to the difficulties  indicated,  the most  common  and accessible  diagnostic  techniques  are the serological \nones to demonstrate the presence of antibodies against the causative agent. In this regard, it is worth recalling the kinetics of antibody response against B. burgdorferi . Thus, from the bite of the infecting tick \nto the development  of the humoral  immune response,  a \u2018window period\u2019  or \u2018serological  silence\u2019  passes,  in \nwhich  the presence of antibodies  is not detected in the infected individual.  In patients  who develop EM as \nthe first clinical manifestation of the disease, seroconversion occurs between two and four weeks after \nobservation\n143,160, being those who present  localized  EM, without  systemic involvement,  the ones  with the \nlowest seroconversion rate. A negative serological result at an early stage does not necessarily exclude \nthe diagnosis  of BL. For this reason,  to demonstrate B. burgdorferi  s.l infection,  the serological  test should \nbe repeated at least four weeks later. Anyway, it should be clear that in patients with an EM it is not necessary  to confirm  the presence of antibodies  against  B. burgdorferi  to make the diagnosis  of LB. Early  \nantimicrobial  therapy  may abrogate  the antibody response, resulting in seronegativity,  although evidence \nis contradictory143,161. \nIn general,  the number  of B. burgdorferi  proteins  that are recognized by the immune system  of the infected \nindividual  significantly  increases  during  the course  of the disease.  In the early  stages  of infection,  the first \nproteins to be recognized are OspC (Outer surface protein C), flagellin and BbK32 (Fibronectin- binding \nprotein)162 that the bacterium expresses early to evade immune mechanisms. In relation to IgM and IgG \nantibodies  produced during infection,  IgM occurs in the EM phase  only in half of patients  in the first two to \nfour weeks  of disease  development,  so 50% of them  are negative to this antibody.  If the patient  progresses \ntowards the appearance of a second phase of systemic involvement (e.g.: with associated myalgias and \narthralgias), IgM production reaches a peak at six -eight weeks and then gradually lowers the titre after \nthree  months163. However,  there may be patients  who remain  IgM positive for a long time (up to ten years \nafter the infection has passed and been correctly treated)164. In addition, IgM can be positive in cases of \nsyphilis,  infection  by Epstein- Barr virus,  HIV, systemic lupus  erythematous  and other connective  diseases \nand immunological processes, due to cross -reaction165. Cross -reactions with poorly characterized \ncirculating antigens have also been described in some pregnant women and even in healthy \nindividuals166,167. This is  due to some antigens of  the bacterium may  share epitopes  similar to  these  other \ninfectious  agents  and to the individual's  self-antigens.  The development  of IgM is followed  by an increase \nin IgG production. This  response of polyclonal  IgG is  directed  to numerous  protei ns of the  microorganism \nsuch  as the aforementioned BbK32,  OspC,  flagellin  and VlsE (Vmp -like sequence E). Subsequently,  other \nIgG antibodies are directed against other proteins such as p58, DbpA (Decorin- binding protein A) and \nBmpA ( Borrelia membrane protein A), among others168. In the late and evolved phases of the disease, \nnormally, although not absolutely, IgM turns negative and an increase in IgG is observed compared to a greater number of antigens.  \nFor all the above,  we do not recommend  giving  a diagnosis  of LB based on an isolated  positive  IgM value, \nexcept in early phases, with typical manifestations of the disease and always in an adequate epidemiological environment. Thus, support for the microbiological diagnosis of LB should preferably be \nperformed by IgG measurement (consensus level 9/9).  \nThe most  commonly  used  serological  methods  are the enzyme  immunoassay  (EIA or EIA based),  indirect \nimmunofluorescence assay (IFA) and immunoblot or Western Blot (WB).  \n \n6.2.1 EIA: Different techniques use this approach. The most common is ELISA (enzyme- linked \nimmunosorbent assay), and it can be automated, allowing the processing of  a large number of samples \nand better standardization. Other equivalent techniques, such as ELFA (Enzyme Linked Fluorescent \nAssay), CLIA (ChemiLuminiscence ImmunoAssay) and MMIA (Multiplexed Microbead ImmunoAssay) \nhave been also developed. The antigens used in all these commercially available techniques can be of \nfour types:  1) Sonicates  of the whole  bacterium,  obtained by culture  technique;  2) Purified  native  antigens;  \n3) Recombinant  antigens  (OspC,  OspA,  BmpA,  VlsE);  4) Synthetic  peptides  such  as C6 (extracted  from a \nregion of the VlsE) or pepC10 (extracted from the OspC).  \nThe use of sonicates of whole bacterial cells entails the presence of a high number of antigens, many of them of low specificity, which implies a high risk of generating cross -react ions\n169-171. Some ELISA tests  \nmay use a mixture of recombinant antigens with whole cell lysates, which may increase sensitivity in the \nearly phase of LB while maintaining specificity172,173. With the emergence of new Borrelia spp. as human \npathogens in Eur ope (e.g. B. miyamotoi ) the serodiagnosis is even more difficult since ELISA and WB \ntests  designed for the diagnosis  of LB may also show  cross reactions  against  B. miyamotoi  antibodies  due \nto B. burgdorferi  and B. miyamotoi  share  proteins  such  as FlaB,  GroEL  and BmpA (P39)174,175. If these  \nassays are also cross reactive against other Borrelia spp. such as B. mayonii is unknown. Up to our \nknowledge, this species belonging to the B. burgdorferi s.l. complex has not been found in Europe.  \nIn addition, the sensitivity of commercial EIA based techniques varies depending on the phase of the patient\u2019s disease. Thus, in the phase of localized EM without systemic involvement, the sensitivity is around 54%, in  neuroborreliosis it reaches 81%,  96% in arthritis and 97% in ACA. Specificity  is generally \nconsidered between 90% and 97% in healthy controls\n176. \n \n6.2.2. IFA : Another option for the first step of serodiagnosis is the IFA technique. The antigens used are \ncomplete bacteria fixed on a slide, alone or in combination with immunodominant antigens, such as VslE \nor OspC. Although at first this was the most used or reference technique, today it is used less often than the EIA techniques, since it is not automatable and it is subject to the observer\u2019s s ubjectivity (with the \nconsequent lower reproducibility inter -laboratories)\n177. In addition, the interpretation of results is difficult \nbecause the optimal dilution of the cut -off point is not standardized44. For these reasons, as stated in the \nGerman labor atory  guidelines178, we do not consider  IFA to be the most  appropriate serological  technique \nfor screening (Consensus level: 9/9).  \n \n6.2.3  WB: It is used for confirmation of EIA or IFA tests.  For its interpretation,  qualitative criteria  have been \nproposed (assessing as positive the infection by B. burgdorferi when certain bands appear)179 of a \nquantitative  type (assessing not so much  the type of bands  but the greater  or lesser  number  of them)180 or \na combination of both181. The limitations,  as with other  serological  techniques,  are that the simple  positivity \nof bands in the WB can indicate a past contact with the microorganism, an active acute infection, a persistent infection, a cross -reactivity with other microorganisms (particularly in the presence of isolated \nbands against the flagellin protein) , or be the result of a monoclonal or polyclonal stimulation nonspecific \nB lymphocytes in the course of infections by lymphotropic viruses, such as the VEB. For these reasons, we repeat  that the serological  diagnosis  should be always  made under  a clinical suspicion of LB and within \nthe appropriate epidemiological context (Consensus level: 9/9).  \nThe incorporation of the C6 peptide or the VlsE protein to the EIA techniques has been proposed in America  as a unique and sufficient  technique for the microbiologic al diagnosis  or as a second confirmation \ntest ignoring the use of a WB\n19. In Europe, two- tier laboratory assay strategy based on a highly sensitive \nscreening EIA  based as  first step, followed by a highly specific immunoblot test (WB), as  confirmation for \npositive  or equivocal  cases,  continues  to offer better  profitability13,15,18,178. These differences  are due to the \nfact that in Europe the presence of various  genospecies  involved in LB (B. garinii,  B. afzelli,  B. burgdorferi \ns.s.) can generate antigenic polymorphisms, complicating the serodiagnosis based on ELISA C6, unlike in America, where B. burgdorferi s.s. is the only species involved in LB\n182. \nTaking into account the comments and experience, in Europe the recommended serologic diagnosis of  \nLB consists of an EIA based technique followed by WB13,15,18,178. It must be mentioned that these tests \nmust be performed only in cases of clinically suspected LB (for patients with signs indicated under the \nclinical case definitions) in an adequate epidemiological environment, with the exception of EM, to avoid over-testing with the subsequent unnecessary costs\n13. This panel assumes the recom mendation with a \nlevel of consensus: 9/9.  \nAs already mentioned above, the serology results will depend on the stage of the disease. Thus, in early LB, whose only manifestation of the disease may be the presence of EM, or in the short -term acute \nneuroborreliosis,  serology  can be negative in up to 60% of patients.  In these  cases, with high suspicion of \nLB and negative serology results, it is advisable to repeat it in three or four weeks to check if there is seroconversion\n18. (Level of consensus: 9/9).  \nA properly treated LB does not preclude the subject from being reinfected after a new tick bite. In these cases, when antibodies  from the first infection  may continue to exist,  serodiagnosis  is complicated for the \nclinician. When we have a patient with a possible reinfection with previously positive serology, it is \nadvisable to do a serology in the new acute phase of reinfection, repeating it three- four weeks later in \norder  to detect  any increase in the antibody  titre or modifications  in the pattern of WB bands,  with respect \nto the first infection (Consensus level: 9/9). In case of suspected neuroborreliosis, blood serology is insufficient since, even if positive, it would establish the diagnosis  only in a few cases  (e.g.: the development  of facial  paralysi s in a child after a recent \nbite of I. ricinus in an endemic area with a positive serology result against B. burgdorferi is highly \nsuggestive of neuroborreliosis).  CSF analysis  should be performed,  since on rare occasions  patients  may \nshow IgG antibodies in the CSF in the absence of a peripheral response. In neuroborreliosis there is a lymphocytic pleocytosis, sometimes with the presence of plasma cells, a highly suggestive finding. The spirochetal invasion of the CNS results in the  local production of CXCL13, a B -cell attracting chemokine \nwith the subsequent intrathecal production of specific antibodies. The demonstration of intrathecal antibody production is highly indicative of neuroborreliosis and relies on measuring anti -IgG Borrelia \nantibodies in both CSF and serum, and referring it to the total albumin or immunoglobulins G in both samples\n111. The formula usually employed is:  \nAntibody Index = Concentration (U/ml) of specific IgG antibodies in CSF/Concentration (U/ml) of specific IgG antibodies in blood serum / Total concentration (mg/L) of IGG en CSF/ Total concentration (mg/L) of IgG in blood serum.  \nAn antibody index greater than 1.3 indicates positivity for intrathecal synthesis\n183,184. In addition, the CSF \ncan be processed for culture and molecular techniques.  \n \n6.3 Other  techniques for the diagnosis of infection  with B. burgdorferi  s.l. and LB \nThere are other techniques that have  not been approved by any scientific agency or society as valid for \nthe diagnosis of LB and that, for this reason, are discouraged:  \n \n6.3.1.  Determination of CD57+  \nCD57+, also called HNK -1, LEU -7 or L2, is a sulfated carbohydrate molecule, with a molecular weight \nbetween 100 and 115 kD. It has been defined as a Natural Killer (NK) lymphocyte marker, although it is  \nonly expressed in a percentage of lymphocytes  and is also expressed in T lymphocytes, especially  in the  \nsenescence phase or \u2018exhausted lymphocytes\u2019185. Based on a study  by Stricker  and Winger,  a low CD57+ \ncell count (mean 30\u00b116 cells/ml) was associated with the controversial term chronic LB186. The authors \nstudied 73 patients with LB who started late antibiotic treatment and found an increase in the count of \nthese cells after therapy (66\u00b139 cells/mL). However, this study suffers from several biases, such as the \nlow number of patients included, biases in the presentation of results, non- monitoring of expression \nkinetics in patien ts after treatment, non -validated control groups, and absence of a clear case and \ntreatment definition.  Other researchers, such  as Marques et al. found  no significant differences  in CD57+ \nbetween nine patients with post -Lyme syndrome versus 12 patients cur ed of LB and the control group \nconsisting of nine healthy volunteers187. \nThe elevation or decrease of the CD57+ marker has been associated with HIV, B hepatitis, C hepatitis, measles,  parvovirus  19 and cytomegalovirus  (CMV)  infections\n188, and non-infectious  pathologies,  such  as \nmultiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, \nankylosing spondylitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, among others. Alterations in the expression of this \nmarker have been also detected in different types of cancer189. \nBased on these  studies  and publications,  the CD57 marker does not  seem a useful  parameter even after \nantibiotic  treatment  or persistence of symptoms.  To date,  none studies  have  proven the usefulness  of this \ntest or its sensitivity and specificity (Consensus level: 9/9)  \n \n6.3.2.  ELISPOT  Interferon -\u03b3 Test (IFN-\u03b3) \nIt is based on the release of IFN -\u03b3 from samples of peripheral blood leukocytes that are stimulated with \nantigen/s  of the microorganism,  in order  to explore the stimulation and activation of T lymphocytes  against \nthe different B. burgdorferi genospecies.  \nSeveral studies have  shown the elevation of IFN-\u03b3 levels in  patients with  early, late/evolved LB  and post- \nLyme syndrome. The sensitivity of this test during the early phase of the disease ranges from 36% to 69%\n190. In another s tudy in which this test was performed for patients who had a positive ELISA C6 test, \nsensitivity  was increased  to 83%191. Also,  in this unique study,  the decrease of this parameter  was verified \nfor patients undergoing antibiotic therapy for LB, and no othe r study has demonstrated the agreement \nbetween the serological tests and the concentration of IFN -\u03b3. The specificity of the test is highly variable \namong studies according to the chosen population. Similarly, cross -reaction with other spirochetes and \nlack of reproducibility has been demonstrated192. The determination of this molecule in other samples \n(synovial fluid, CSF, skin biopsies, etc.) has not shown that it can be a useful diagnostic tool.  \n \n6.3.3.  IFN-\u03b1 \nThere are studies, such as that of Jacek et al . (2013)193 that have shown an increase in IFN -\u03b1 levels for \npatients with post -Lyme syndrome, which may suggest the existence of immune -mediated processes in \npatients with persistent symptoms, which may contribute to the immunopathology of the disease. These same authors  demonstrated how treatment  with beta- lactam  antibiotics  did not modulate the activated  \nimmune  response.  As with the previous  test, more  studies  are needed to demonstrate  the clinical utility  of \nthis parameter.  \nTherefore, currently the ELISPOT IFN -\u03b3 test and the IFN -\u03b1 should not be used in clinical practice until \nother research studies prove their usefulness (Consensus level: 9/9).  \n \n6.3.4.  Lymphocytic proliferation test \nIt serves to assess the lymphoproliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells against B. \nburgdorferi  antigens.  The results  are expressed  based on a Stimulation Index  (SI). If the SI is greater  than \nten, the test is considered positive and if i t is less than ten, negative. At present, no study has been able \nto demonstrate its clinical utility, obtaining low specificities and sensitivities, so that the diagnostic guidelines do not contemplate this test\n13. (Consensus level: 9/9)  \n \n6.3.5  CXCL -13 marker  \nThis is an immunological marker (chemokine) that can be studied in CSF when suspected \nneuroborreliosis, also known by other names such as BCA -1 or B cell -attracting chemokine (B cell - \nattracting chemokine -1), and BLC or B lymphocyte chemoatt ractant. Its primary function is to attract B \nlymphocytes.  It is expressed in high density  in organs  such  as the spleen,  lymph  nodes,  liver and digestive \nsystem.  In relation  to LB, this molecule is becoming one of the most  promising  diagnostic  tools.  Its greatest \nusefulness is within the diagnosis of early neuroborreliosis and several studies have demonstrated its \nelevation in the CSF of these patients194-196. It is detected before the antibodies in the CSF and also its \nconcentration decreases in a sho rt period of time once the antibiotic treatment is established, so it can \nalso be used  for monitoring it. It has a sensitivity  of 89%-97% and a specificity of 96%.  One of its drawbacks \nis that there is currently  no established value as a cut-off point,  with each laboratory  having its own,  so the \ninterpretation can be variable inter -laboratories. Another drawback is that it can also rise in other \ninflammatory diseases of the CNS such as some viral meningitis, neurosyphilis, cryptococcosis or even lymphoma in CNS, which forces to discard these for a correct interpretation of this marker. This panel \nrecommends this determination for the diagnosis and follow -up of LB with caution until there is no more \ndata and its specificity is better known (Consensu s level: 9/9)  \n \n6.3.6.  There  are other  markers that are currently  being evaluated,  such  as the determination of CCL-19197, \napolipoprotein B -100198,199 antibody -free chains (kappa and lambda) or the determination of total \nIgM and albumin in the CSF of patients with probable neuroborreliosis. However, none has shown to  be \nmore  promising  than CXCL -13, as the range of positivity  in patients  presenting with other non-Lyme  neuro-  \ninflammatory  diseases  is higher,  leading to low specificity21. Techniques  such  as either  dark-field or focus \nfloating microscopy are not recommended for diagnostic purposes15,20 (Consensus level: 9/9).   \n7. TREATMENT  \nThe antimicrobial treatment of LB has not changed in recent decades and it is based on the treatment of \nthe infection by B. burg dorferi depending on the stage of the disease and the organ and/or system \naffected200,201. \nTo our knowledge, there are no large clinical trials with an appropriate design and enough number of patients to support the recommendations with high level of scientific evidence in some cases, so many \nrecommendations are fundamentally based on the few clinical trials and meta -analysis studies collected \nin the scientific  consensus  recommendations  published by other  scientific  societies\n15,17,19,55,202. The choice \nof the drug will depend on the age, history  of allergies,  pregnancy,  intolerances,  or sun exposure given the \npossibility of photosensitivity with doxycycline. Tables 5 to 12 schematically show the drugs and \nrecommended doses in each of the processes associated with LB.  \nWe are aware  of the controversy  with the term \"chronic  Lyme\"  and its treatment203,204. Since the members \nof this panel  do not consider  other  LB forms  than those developed in the different  sections  of the text, and \nreject the term \u201cChronic Lyme Disease\u201d related to a persistent infection by B. burgdorferi resistant to \nconventional treatment, we will not make recommendations on this aspect. Anyway, all the members of \nthis document are against carrying out prolonged treatments with antibiotics and/or their combinations in \npatients  who suffer  non-specific  clinical manifestations  such  as asthenia,  arthralgia,  lack of concentration, \netc., with the exceptions that appear in the text for the simple fact of having suffered  a previous infection \nby B. burgdorferi s.l. (Consensus level: 9/9)  \nMost LB patients  respond to antimicrobial treatment in a timely  manner, depending on the type  of clinical \nmanifestation and/or  affected  organ  or system,  although in patients  under  special  conditions,  such  as those \nundergoing immunosuppressor treatments, anti -TNF, hematological malignancies or in elderly patients, \nthe response may be slower and sometimes patients have to be retreated205-208. \nAnother aspect that we want to  highlight is  that this panel recommends  the use of doxycycline over other \ntherapeutic options, when appropriate. Consideration should be given to the good penetration of this \nantibiotic into the CNS and other tissues due to the possibility of spirochete di ssemination. Unlike the \nrecently published American Guidelines, which consider the preferential  treatment with intravenous  beta-  \nlactams in the treatment of neuroborreliosis19, doxycycline can also be considered as an alternative \ntreatment  to intravenous  beta-lactams  for the  treatment  of CNS  infections  with meningeal  involvement.  In \nfact, in Europe, doxycycline is considered the treatment of choice if there are no parenchymal \ncomplications15,17,209,210. (Consensus level: 9/9)  \nIn addition, doxycycline has the advantage of being active and of choice against other microorganisms \ntransmitted by ticks that occasionally  can co-infect  the patient,  such  as A. phagocytophilum,  B. miyamotoi \nand Rickettsia spp. that are circulating in our  environment and are transmitted by I. ricinus . It is only \nrecommended avoiding doxycycline in pregnancy and lactation, when the risk benefit must always be \nassessed211,212. Regarding the use of doxycycline in children, the American Academic of Pediatrics \nrecently wrote: \u2018Clinical use of tetracyclines  in children younger than eight years has been limited due to \nthe known binding to teeth  and bones  in young  children that permanently  may stain  teeth.  However,   \ndoxycycline, a second -generation tetracycline, has not been shown to cause tooth staining in young \nchildren\u2019. \u2018Doxycycline can be used for short durations (e.g. 21 days or less) without regarding patient \nage\u2019213. \nAnother factor to consider when prescribing an antimicrobial treatment against LB is that although \ntreatments  are general ly well tolerated,  depending  on the phase of the disease,  more  than 15% of patients \nmay experience  a Jarisch- Herxheimer  reaction consisting of a transient  exacerbation  of symptoms  during \nthe first 24 hours of treatment200. \n \n7.1. Early  localized phase  \n \n7.1.1.  Erythema  migrans \nThere are some randomized clinical trials comparing the efficacy of different treatments in this situation. \nResults  may vary between those performed in Europe or in the US, because of the design and to the fact \nthat the Borrelia genospecies involved may be different. Anyway, and based on these clinical trials, the \ntreatment  of choice in this situation is an oral regimen with doxycycline,  amoxicillin  or cefuroxime  axetil214- \n217 as is showed in table 5. This panel, when no contraindication, preferably recommends the use of \ndoxycycline for 10 -14 days, both in children and adults (Consensus level: 9/9).  \nIf a beta -lactam from those specified (equally effective) is chosen, it should be prolonged for a minimum \nof 14 days. The use of macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin or erythromycin) as first -line drugs is \ngenerally discouraged, leaving them as an alternative in cases where doxycycline, amoxicillin or \ncefuroxime cannot  be used.  In the case of the use of azithromycin, some authors  recommended  prolonging \nthe treatment  for seven days218. In pregnant  patients,  the use of ceftriaxone is the recommended option219. \n(Consensus level: 9/9).  \n \nTable  5: Treatment  of erythema  migrans  in the early  localized  phase without  other  associated  symptoms.  \n \nDrug  Adult  dose  Child  dose  Duration  \nDoxycycline  100 mg orally  BID 4 mg/kg/day orally  in two  divided  \ndoses (maximum 100 mg per dose)  10 days \n(10-21 days)  \nAmoxicillin  500 mg orally  TID 50 mg/kg/day  orally  in three  divided  \ndoses  14 days \n(14-21 days)  \nCefuroxime  axetil  500 mg orally  BID 30 mg/kg/day  orally  in two divided doses \n(maximum 500 mg  per dose)  14 days \n(14-21 days)  \nAzithromycin  500 mg orally  OD 5-10 mg/kg/day  orally  (maximum 500 mg \nper dose)  5 days (5-10 \ndays)  \n \nBID: one doses  every12h;  TID: one doses  every  8h; OD: one doses  every  24h. \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n7.1.2.  Borrelial  Lymphocytoma \nThe pattern for borrelial lymphocytoma is similar to that used in EM15, although a retrospective study of \n144 adult patients  treated with these  guidelines has shown  that 9.7% of  the patients  required retreatment \nbecause the lesion persisted after one month. Subsequently, it disappeared in all cases220. The \nrecommended treatment is showed in table 6. It must be considered that there are no consensus among \nSocieties since French guidelines recommend 14 days15 and other guidelines such as the German ones \nrecommend 21 days55. \nThe duration in days of the treatment recommended in the table should be considered according to the \nseverity and persistence of  the clinical manifestations. Most patients treated with the recommended \nregimen present a complete resolution of the signs and symptoms in the following 20 days, avoiding the \nprogression to other phases of the disease. As in other infectious diseases, some patients present subjective  symptoms  (headache,  musculoskeletal  pain,  arthralgia  or fatigue)  that can persist for weeks  or \nmonths after treatment. These symptoms usually resolve spontaneously in the following months and do not require sustained or repeated antibiotic treatment, as they are not due to the persistence of the infection. However, if the appearance of other clinical manifestations (e.g.: fever) is observed despite treatment, co -infections with other tick -borne agents ( A. phagocytophilum, Babesia divergens, B. \nmiyamotoi ) should be ruled out. (Consensus level: 9/9)  \nIt should also be considered that infection with B. burgdorferi and LB do not leave permanent immunity \nand LB may be suffered in more than one occasion (very rare). In that case, the patient will be treated under the same recommended guidelines\n15. (Consensus level: 9/9)  \n \n7.2. Early  disseminated  phase \n \n \n7.2.1.

Early  neuroborreliosis  \nClinical Practice Guidelines for therapeutic management of Lyme neuroborreliosis have been recently published by the Infectious  Diseases  Society  of America,  American  Academy  of Neurology  and American \nCollage  of Rheumatology\n19, and the European  Federation of the Neurology  Societies  (EFNS)123. German \nand French Guidelines have been also recently published15,17. \nUsing an intravenous beta- lactam (ceftriaxone, penicillin or cefotaxime) for the treatment of these \nconditions has been the classic recommendation, and this option continues to be the one recommended by the American guidelines.  In Europe,  the new guidelines recommend the use of oral doxycycline as long \nas there are no parenchymal complications at the brain or spinal level or the clinical manifestations are very severe\n210. \nThe recommended treatment for isolated facial paralysis without signs of meningeal involvement is oral doxycycline for a minimum of 14 days and a maximum of 28 days, although a clinical trial did not show differences in the response related to the duration of treatment\n222. In any case, as specified in previous \nparagraphs,  the history  of allergies,  oral tolerance, pregnancy  and lactation should be taken  into account. \nThe minimum duration of treatment should last at least 14 days in children and adults15,17. Adjunctive \ncorticosteroids  neither improve nor impair the outcome for patients with  LB peripheral facial palsy  treated \nwith doxycycline223. As also specified  in previous  paragraphs,  doxycycline is the elective  antibiotic   \ntreatment for the  remaining neurological manifestations of the early phase, and as an alternative, a  beta- \nlactam by intravenous route at the doses and with the duration specified in the table 7. In case of \nparenchymal involvement, the recommended treatment is an intravenous beta- lactam as is showed in \ntable 7.

Carditis \nAsymptomatic AV -B with a PR interval of less than 300 milliseconds observed with relative frequency in \nthe early stages of the disease does not require antimicrobial treatment different from that of the process itself. Patients with myopericarditis or those with severe or potentially severe involvement should receive intravenous antibiotic treatment at the doses and for the duration specified in Table 8. This can be simplified to the oral route (doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil) once the blockage is resolved and/or clinical improvement occurs until completing a cycle of 21 -28 days\n19. In patients  with symptomatic \nbradycardia that cannot be managed with drugs, the American guidelines recommend the use of temporary pacemakers\n19. This panel agrees with these recommendations.

Late neuroborreliosis  \nAs detailed in the corresponding section for this phase, different neurological manifestations have been \ndescribed, such as subacute encephalopathy, mononeuritis multiplex, peripheral axonal sensory neuropathy  or encephalomyelitis,  among  others.  These pictures  are very rare and avoidable with effective \ntreatment in previous stages of the disease. There are excellent manuscripts that have exhaustively reviewed their therapeutic approach. The EFNS recommends treatment of these conditions with  \nintravenous  ceftriaxone for three  weeks\n123. The same therapeutic  option is recommended  by the American \nAcademy  of Neurology  (AAN),  although  they do not specify  the duration of treatment224. German guidelines \nrecommend the same scheme for two- three weeks17, while French guidelines recommend doxycycline \nand ceftriaxone as an alternative for three weeks15. This panel, as in the previous sections, chooses to \nrecommend doxycycline as the first option and  ceftriaxone as an alternative depending on the  severity of \nthe clinical picture and accompanying manifestations  (e.g.:  ACA and polyneuropathy),  as showed  in Table \n11. As an adjunct to antimicrobial therapy, accompanying symptoms should be treated. Rehabil itation \ntreatment and psychological support to patients are sometimes needed.

Post -Lyme syndrome.  Chronic Lyme borreliosis. \nThe prescription of an adequate treatment,  under  the recommendations  established in the text, allows  the \ncontrol of the infection with cure for a very high percentage of patients. For patients treated in the early phase of the disease, cure usually occurs within three weeks whereas in the late- phase of the disease, \nthe response is usually  slower.  Antibiot ic treatment  may fail, although this situation is rare and it is usually \ndue to problems with adherence or absorption of antibiotics rather than to the existence of antibiotic resistance of B. burgdorferi . For patients with the so- called post -Lyme syndrome, there is some \ncontroversy. Studies showing no effect on such symptoms after prolonging the duration of the antibiotic treatment,  repeating it or carrying out cycles with antibiotics,  have  been  carried  out\n144,145,225 -229. This  \napproach is not recommended in any guideline.  However,  some authors  advocate  prolonging treatment  in \ncase of persistence of symptoms and evidence of coinfection by other tick -borne agents203. Anyway, the \nissue draws great controversy.  \nThe members of this panel, until there is more scientific evidence, and since the persistence of B. \nburgdorferi infection after adequate treatment has not been demonstrated, are positioned not to use \nprolonged treatments or cycles or combinations of antibi otics in these cases. (Consensus level: 9/9). \nWe have often observed that prolonged treatment with doxycycline improves subjective symptoms in \npatients with post -Lyme disease or with other persistent inespecific symtoms of different diseases. This \ncould be due to the inhibition effect of doxycycline metalloproteases rather than to their antimicrobial \neffect230. \n \n8. PROPHYLAXIS  \nProphylaxis  of LB is based on pre-exposition measures  to avoid the bite of the vector  and post-exposition \nmeasures.  \n \n8.1. Pre-exposition  measures \nThe best method to avoid LB is preventing tick bites. In the table 12, the general recommendations for preventing  LB are showed.  This implicates  preventing tick exposure  by avoiding tick-infested areas  during \nthe periods  of I. ricinus  activity  in Spain\n231. In case  of going to the countryside,  being keeping to the center \nof trails could minimize contact with adjacent vegetation where ticks are more abundant. The use of \nprotective clothing that limits the contact of ticks with the  body can be very effective to avoid tick \nattachment. It is advisable wearing light -colored clothing to detect the arthropod before attached to the \nskin, cap,  long trousers  tucked into the socks, long-sleeved shirt tucked into the trousers  and do not wear \nsandals or open -toed shoes. It is desirable to inspect for unattached ticks on clothing because they can \nturn into a later tick-bite as well as washing clothes  in hot water  and dry clothing  on high heat after outdoor \nactivities.  Bathing may also wash  off unattached ticks231. The use of repellents  has also demonstrated the \ndecrease of tick -bites incidence when applied to clothes and/or bare skin. A good repellent should be \neffective against various arthropods, no irritating after topical administration, with pleasant odor or \nodorless,  persistent  after washing and economi c. Recommended  repellents  for the prevention of tick-bites \nare DEET  (N,N-diethyl -meta -toluamide),  picardin,  ethyl -3-(N-n-butyl -N-acetyl)  aminopropionate (IR3535), \noil of lemon  eucalyptus  (OLE),  p-menthane- 3,8-diol (PMD),  2-undecanone,  or permethrin19,231. All of them \ncan be applied to both skin and clothing, except permethrin  which  must be  only applied to clothing due to \nits toxicity. When clothes are sprayed with permethrin (0.5%) or made with pretreated, permethrin- impregnated material provides high effective protection against tick -bites\n232,233. Its use on clothing could \nbe effective  for up several  weeks  and even supports  the washings  reducing  significantly  tick-bites  and tick- \nborne pathogen transmission232,234. In general, efficacy and duration of repellents depends on the \nconcentration used providing greater and/or longer periods of efficacy those products with higher concentrations\n235. However , DEET  optimal  concentration range  varies  from 15 to 33%.  Products   \ncontaining >50%  do not offer a significant  increase in protection time over lower  concentrations236. DEET, \nwhich is available in a wide variety of topical formulas providing up to 12 hours of protection, has been \nshown to be the most effective and with the broadest spectrum repellent19. \nDespite these products are reasonably safe to use, many people develo p certain toxicity. This fact has \nmisguided in the use of repellents  based on natural  products  as garlic,  citronella,  eucalyptus  oil, geranium \noil, lavender oil or Alaska yellow cedar oil (e.g., citriodiol or p- menthane- 3,8-diol available on the market \nas a tick repellent) but  there is  not enough  evidence and their effectiveness has  to be demonstrated. The \nSpanish Association of Pediatrics as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP)237 and the CDC \nonly recommend DEET for children at least two months of age, although it is desirable to be avoided as much as possible in children under  two years of age\n238. The American Association of Pediatrics and the \nCDC do not recommend OLE and PMD for children <three years of age19. The contact between humans \nand parasitized domestic animals could increase the risk of a tick -borne disease acquisition. Thus, the \nmost effective preventative measure arises in the use of effective long- acting acaricides in pets as \npermethrin, amitraz or fipronil or lindano239,240. \nThe members of this panel assume these recommendations to avoid tick -bites (Consensus level: 9/9). \nOther  measures  based on controlling  and reducing ticks and tick-infected populations  to reduce the \nnumber of human tick -bites and human diseases include phys ical, mechanical and biological strategies \nand are beyond the scope of these guidelines.  \nVaccines for preventing LB were developed in past and only available in USA but to date commercial vaccines  are not available for humans\n241,242. New technologies  based  in the new RNA  vaccines  developing \nantibodies against tick -saliva components have  shown \u2018in vitro\u2019 activity  to reduce B. burgdorferi infection. \nEducational  programs  could  be a good  tool to decrease the risk of acquiring a tick borne  infectious  disease \nincreasing people confidence and likelihood to practice precautionary behaviors243. \nThis panel recommends education programs in schools and recreational or professional associations (hunters, mountaineers...) that instruct in the prevention of tick bites, how  to recognize them and ways of \nextraction (Consensus level: 9/9).  \n \nTable  12: General  recommendations  to prevent  Lyme  borreliosis.  \n\u2022 Do not go off the trail when  walking  in areas  where there are ticks.  \n\u2022 Use clothes that cover exposed areas of the body (cap, long trousers tucked into the socks, long \nsleeved shirt into the trousers and appropriate footwear).  \n\u2022 Wear  light-colored clothing  to detect  ticks before they attach.  \n\u2022 Use tick repellents.  \n\u2022 Inspect  the body  after being in an outdoor  area where  ticks are abundant.  \n\u2022 Remove  the tick with tweezers  as soon  as possible when detected.  \n\u2022 Take doxycycline  in certain  circumstances  after tick-bite. \n\u2022 Observe the site of the tick attachment  for up to six weeks.   \n8.2. Post -exposition  measures \nIf a patient is bitten by a tick, we must proceed to extract it and the use of antibiotic prophylaxis with \ndoxycycline should be considered.  \n \n8.2.1.  Tick removal  \nDespite  wearing appropriate clothing,  tick bites  can occur  and they are usually  painless,  making important \nto do an exhaustive  exploration of the entire  body  in order  to look for any attached  ticks and remove  them. \nRemoval  of the attached  ticks must  be done as soon  as possible since it is  accepted  that 36-48 hours  for \nB. burgdorferi  transmission are needed, and the risk increases with longer  attachments.  Some European \nstudies suggest the transmission of B. burgdorferi within 24 hours of attachment of I. ricinus ticks 244,245. \nThe use of tweezers  or force ps to remove  ticks significantly  decreases  the risk of complications  associated \nto the tick -bite or the infection with the microorganisms they transmit246. The correct extraction of ticks \nshould be done using thin- tipped tweezers or blunt, rounded forceps introducing them between tick head \nand the skin to grasp the mouth parts of ticks intact, if possible, and pulling the tick straight upward with steady pressure, perpendicular to the skin\n247. Other tick removal devices have been shown being useful \nfor removing ticks248-251. If after the extraction any part of the tick is retained in the skin it should be \nadvisable to perform a biopsy of the inoculation place in order to avoid a neurotoxic paralysis due to the presence  of the arthropod salivary  glands  and the neurotoxin in the patient  when the bite is close to a \nnerve structure\n252. Nevertheless,  last American  Guidelines  for the Prevention,  Diagnosis  and Treatment  of \nLyme Disease indicates that if a tick is partially removed, but detached mouthparts remain and cannot  \neasily be removed from the skin, they should be left alone and permitted to fall out19. After removing the \ntick from the skin area,  it should be disinfected with povidone iodine,  chlorhexidine or other  skin \ndisinfectant. Ticks removed should be stored at -20\u00b0C for future analyses for the detection or isolation of \nthe causative agent in case of the patient develops an infectious disease253. Other popular methods for \nremoving ticks from skin as manual extraction, oil, vaseline, petroleum, lighted cigarettes, among others, are associated with an increase of complications and transmission of infectious agents\n246,247. Taken into \naccount the above considerations, this panel recommends not handling the tick and use forceps for the \ntick extraction, as is showed in figure 9 (Consensus level: 9/9).  \n Figure 9: Recommended type of forceps  (A) and tick extraction using forceps  (B). \n \n \n \n \n8.2.2.  Antibiotic  Prophylaxis  after  Tick Bite \nSingle -dose doxycycline, given within 72 hours of exposure, is common practice in US and has been \nevaluated in different clinical studies for postexposure prophylaxis of three spirochetal infections: Lyme \ndisease,  syphilis,  and tick-borne  relapsing fever254. The last Guidelines  by the Infectious  Diseases  Society \nof Amer ica (IDSA) recommend prophylactic antibiotic therapy only to adults and children within 72 hours \nof removal  if the tick bite was from an  identified Ixodes spp., if it  occurred  in a highly endemic area,  and if \nthe tick was attached for \u226536 hours19. The preferred antibiotic regimen for the chemoprophylaxis is the \nadministration of a single  dose  of oral doxycycline  (200 mg for adults  and 4 mg/kg  up to a maximum  dose \nof 200 mg for children)  within  72 hours  of tick removal  over observation.  In this case,  it has been weighed \nthe likelihood of disease and the effectiveness of prophylactic doxycycline therapy to be higher than the potential risks of the antibiotic. This fact has been not extensible for European countries where it is not recommended with the argument that it will  be necessary to perform 40- 125 prophylaxes for preventing \none borreliosis\n255, and the impact on the intestinal flora and a possible development of resistance is \nconceivable17. Anyway,  doxycycline  prophylaxis  must  be reconsidered in Europe.  Thus,  a clinica l trial that \nwould  allow extending this recommendation to Europe has been recently published256. In this open- label, \nrandomized,  controlled trial, administering a single  dose of 200 mg doxycycline  within  72 h after removing \nan attached tick from the skin, compared to no treatment in people older than eight years resulted in a relative risk  reduction of  67% (95%  CI 31  - 84%). No serious adverse events were  reported. Since we do \nnot have data from Spain  and considering that it is a sunny  area,  a reasonable option might  be to consider \nthat when the tick has been manipulated, the tick is engorged or the patient has a high level of anxiety, \nthe prophylaxis with doxycycline could be offered (Consensus level: 9/9) . \nSafety  of doxycycline  during pregnancy  has not been assessed;  therefore,  in the case  of pregnant  women, \nrisks,  benefits  and uncertainties  of doxycycline  versus  observation should be weighed\n254. In any case,  after \nsuffering a tick bite, it is advisable to instruct the patients in the possible signs and symptoms that they \nmay develop and they should at least  observe the point  of the bite for at least  six weeks  (Consensus  level: \n9/9). \n \n               \n  \nCONFLICTS  OF INTEREST  \n1.
