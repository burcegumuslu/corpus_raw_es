Pall\n[Liquid Fuel Treatment systems](https://shop.pall.com/us/en/power-utilities/combined-cycle-plants/liquid-fuel-treatment/zidi1chhx3d) remove contaminants in fuel to exceed stringent purity requirements of new generation gas combustion turbines. Contaminant free fuel enables gas turbines to optimize power production and enable better control of integral gas functions. Properly sized, installed, and maintained treatment systems play a key role in gas turbine preventative maintenance planning. Our durable filtering and treatment products keep fuel to high purity standards needed to ensure the quality of the combustion process. The result of effective fuel treatment is cleaner turbine combustion leading to more efficient power production.\nWe bring a complete approach to fuel treatment management for gas turbines to minimize particle ingression into fuel systems. By implementing economical Pall filter schemes, contaminants and aerosols are minimized to prevent:\n- Increased downtime and loss of production\n- Costly fluid disposal and component replacement\n- Increased Operating & Maintenance costs\n- Decreased efficiency of energy transmission\n- Inhibited effective heat transfer\n- Leakage, wear of elastomers and seals\n- Corrosive wear to gas turbine shafts, blades, and fuel injection nozzles\nGas turbines cannot efficiently combust and create power without pure fuel. Pall\u2019s filters and treatment systems are engineered to curb contamination that inhibit a turbine system\u2019s primary functions.\nThank you for your interest a sales representative will contact you.\nSepraSol Outperform All Others\nPall Products\nThe Pall SepraSol\u2122 Plus Liquid/Gas Coalescer removes liquids and solids from fuel streams that contain high concentrations of unwanted liquids and aerosols. Our staff of research scientists and engineers have designed these coalescers that change the way fuel streams are conditioned. Pall SepraSol Plus media can process several times more liquid per unit area of media than conventional media and often eliminates the need for upstream bulk separation equipment like mist eliminators and vane separators. The SepraSol Plus media is supplied in a large flow, high performance 6-inch diameter cartridge that can economically treat fuels flows in combined cycle applications that require a high degree of protection from both solids and liquids including. SepraSol Plus Coalescers protect turbines by removing lubrication oil, water, and compressor wear products from effluent fuel streams. Removing liquid aerosols from fuel streams prevent turbines from corrosive wear on their internal blades and on the fuel injection nozzles that supply fuel to the turbine. Our systems are ideal for properly cleaning dirty fuel to protect low Nox burners and fuel injection nozzles.\nPall\n[Ultipleat\u00ae High Flow filters](https://shop.pall.com/us/en/power-utilities/nuclear-plants/nuclear-condensate/zidgri78mak) are a large diameter, coreless, single open ended, pleated cartridge with an inside-to-outside flow pattern. The filter's unique crescent-shaped pleat geometry, combined with its large 152.4 mm (6 inch) diameter and proprietary range of available our filter media, allows users to use significantly fewer filters and smaller housings for high gas flow rate applications needed to successfully power gas turbines.\nBenefits:\n- Extended operating life of turbines\n- Increased plant efficiency and decreased unplanned downtime\n- Enhanced process control\n- Lower maintenance and unplanned costs\n- Extended fuel life\nPall Fuel Treatment Systems are the most economical and durable option to deliver clean efficient fuel to your gas turbines.
