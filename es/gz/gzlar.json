Protein kinase N1 (PKN1) is a serine/threonine kinase that has been shown to contribute to Glut4 translocation to the membrane and glucose transport. Here, we evaluated the role of PKN1 in glucose metabolism under insulin-resistant conditions in primary visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from 31 patients with obesity and in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, in vitro studies in human VAT samples and mouse adipocytes were conducted to investigate the role of PKN1 in the adipogenic maturation process and glucose homeostasis control. We show that insulin-resistant adipocytes present a decrease in PKN1 activation levels compared to nondiabetic control counterparts. We further show that PKN1 controls the adipogenesis process and glucose metabolism. PKN1-silenced adipocytes present a decrease in both differentiation process and glucose uptake, with a concomitant decrease in the expression levels of adipogenic markers, such as PPAR\u03b3, FABP4, adiponectin and CEBP\u03b1. Altogether, these results point to PKN1 as a regulator of key signaling pathways involved in adipocyte differentiation and as an emerging player of adipocyte insulin responsiveness. These findings may provide new therapeutic approaches for the management of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.\n- ItemOpen Access\n[NOD mouse dorsal root ganglia display morphological and gene expression defects before and during autoimmune diabetes development](/items/74e9bdde-62c1-4170-99c4-e9847d45f2e2)(Frontiers media, 2023) Corral Pujol, Marta; Arpa i Puigdemont, Berta; Rosell Mases, Estela; Egia-Mendikute, Leire; Mora Giral, Concepci\u00f3; Stratmann, Thomas; S\u00e1nchez (S\u00e0nchez Pla), \u00c1lex; Casanovas i Llorens, Anna; Esquerda Colell, Josep; Mauricio Puente, D\u00eddac; Vives Pi, Marta; Verdaguer Autonell, JoanIntroduction: During the development of Autoimmune Diabetes (AD) an autoimmune attack against the Peripheral Nervous System occurs. To gain insight into this topic, analyses of Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) from Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice were carried out. Methods: Histopathological analysis by electron and optical microscopy in DRG samples, and mRNA expression analyzes by the microarray technique in DRG and blood leukocyte samples from NOD and C57BL/6 mice were performed. Results: The results showed the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in DRG cells early in life that could be related to a neurodegenerative process. In view of these results, mRNA expression analyses were conducted to determine the cause and/or the molecules involved in this suspected disorder. The results showed that DRG cells from NOD mice have alterations in the transcription of a wide range of genes, which explain the previously observed alterations. In addition, differences in the transcription genes in white blood cells were also detected. Discussion: Taken together, these results indicate that functional defects are not only seen in beta cells but also in DRG in NOD mice. These results also indicate that these defects are not a consequence of the autoimmune process that takes place in NOD mice and suggest that they may be involved as triggers for its development.\n- ItemOpen Access\n[Cost analysis of adult parenteral nutrition systems: three-compartment bag versus customized](/items/0f05b08d-d48b-4a31-9c67-42b9fc26f196)(Aran Ediciones, 2013) Berlana, David; Sabin, Pilar; Gimeno Ballester, Vicente; Romero Jim\u00e9nez, Rosa; Zapatas Rojas, Amalia; M\u00e1rquez, Esther; Mart\u00ednez Cutillas, Julio; Schoenenberger, Joan AntoniBackground: Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a costly technology used widely to provide nutrition to patients who have an inaccessible or non-functioning intestine. Two all-in-one systems currently being used are customized formulations and three-compartment bags. Objective:To provide a systematic cost comparison of the two all-in-one PN systems: individualized (made from nutrient solutions) versus commercialized (made from three-compartment bag), both prepared in hospital pharmacies. Setting:This study was conducted in three public Spanish hospitals. Method:We conducted a cost-minimization study to analyze prospectively the total cost of PN bags, accounting for all of the processes involved in preparing and delivering PN bags (cost of manpower, nutrition solutions, medical supplies and quality controls) in three different healthcare settings. To compare therapeutic alternatives of equivalent nutritional value, the study was performed for the most frequently employed formulation and similar to commercial preparations. A univariate sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of different rates of use of three-compartment PN bag. Results: 157 routine acts of PN bag preparation (65 customized and 92 three-compartment) were observed and timed over 9 days. Total costs of the 157 PN bags were included in the study. Mean costs of customized bags were higher than three-compartment bags, 51.16 \u00b1 5.63 \u20ac versus 39.69 \u00b1 3.00 \u20ac respectively (p < 0.01). Manpower costs were responsible for the majority of the differences found (70%). The time to complete an adult bag for the hospital compounded system was a mean of 25.9 minutes longer than the three-compartment system. In scenarios using a three-compartment system for 30%, 70% and 90% of PN provision, a cost savings of 4.3%, 10.1% and 12.9% respectively could be achieved. Greatest rates of changing from customized bags (70% and 90%), in a hospital with 1,800 PN bags/year, might reduce the annual budget by 9306 \u20ac and 11,964.8 \u20ac, respectively. Meanwhile, in a large facility the savings for 8,000 TPN days would be 64,248 \u20ac and 82,605 \u20ac, respectively. Conclusions:Since seeking cost-reduction of effective treatments is needed, the use of three-compartment bags for standard adult PN could lead to cost savings. Our data should be helpful for health care providers to calculate their own cost of administer.\n- ItemOpen Access\n[Protocolizaci\u00f3n de la Nutrici\u00f3n Artificial por v\u00eda Parenteral.

Las Unidades de Nutrici\u00f3n Artificial (UNA) que dise\u00f1an o revisan su sistema de provisi\u00f3n de NP deben tener en cuenta las referencias metodol\u00f3gicas y normativas existentes as\u00ed como los recursos de que dispone para realizar el proceso. El objetivo de este trabajo consiste en revisar y evaluar las posibilidades existentes para dise\u00f1ar un proceso eficiente y seguro aplicando la metodolog\u00eda de la mejora continua de la calidad. Se revisan los requerimientos actuales en t\u00e9rminos de calidad de formulaci\u00f3n, seguridad y contenci\u00f3n de costes as\u00ed como los recursos disponibles para no mermar las posibilidades de adaptar el tratamiento a las necesidades del paciente ni comprometer su eficacia. La soluci\u00f3n al problema de si el enfoque escogido en el sistema de provisi\u00f3n de NP es adecuado debe venir de la revisi\u00f3n de la calidad del servicio a trav\u00e9s de la evaluaci\u00f3n de indicadores tanto de proceso como de resultado. En esta labor el farmac\u00e9utico del hospital juega un papel relevante como agente garante del cumplimiento de las normas de buena pr\u00e1ctica.\n- ItemOpen Access\n[Calcifilaxis no ur\u00e9mica mediada por acenocumarol](/items/4c736399-7e65-42cd-90c7-a15474747db8)(Grupo Aula M\u00e9dica S.L, 2017) Torres Bondia, Francisco Ignacio; Parada Saavedra, Federico Javier; Fern\u00e1ndez Armenteros, Jos\u00e9 Manuel; Schoenenberger, Joan Antoni", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["/home", null, "javascript:void(0);", "javascript:void(0);", "/forgot", "https://www.udl.cat", "/home", "/community-list", "/statistics/collections/057a33d4-7b60-42d2-84e9-abc3defee096", "javascript:void(0);", null, "javascript:void(0);", "javascript:void(0);", "/forgot", "/", "/communities/3155f59b-68a4-473c-8355-d32f5ea832c0", "/communities/1ff17f59-ff66-48f3-a359-8770d245cca8", "https://repositori.udl.cat/handle/10459.1/30324", "/collections/057a33d4-7b60-42d2-84e9-abc3defee096", "/browse/dateissued?scope=057a33d4-7b60-42d2-84e9-abc3defee096", "/browse/author?scope=057a33d4-7b60-42d2-84e9-abc3defee096", "/browse/title?scope=057a33d4-7b60-42d2-84e9-abc3defee096", "/browse/subject?scope=057a33d4-7b60-42d2-84e9-abc3defee096", "/items/1e8f8693-ba02-4154-ba50-f71b16f47fd5", "/items/1e8f8693-ba02-4154-ba50-f71b16f47fd5", "/items/74e9bdde-62c1-4170-99c4-e9847d45f2e2", "/items/74e9bdde-62c1-4170-99c4-e9847d45f2e2", "/items/0f05b08d-d48b-4a31-9c67-42b9fc26f196", "/items/0f05b08d-d48b-4a31-9c67-42b9fc26f196", "/items/61f92369-98d1-4724-978a-452dff91b2d7", "/items/61f92369-98d1-4724-978a-452dff91b2d7", "/items/4c736399-7e65-42cd-90c7-a15474747db8", "/items/4c736399-7e65-42cd-90c7-a15474747db8", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", null, "", "", "javascript:void(0);", "/info/legal-notice", "/info/feedback", "https://www.openaire.eu/", "http://www.rebiun.org/repositorios/Paginas/evaluacion-repositorios.aspx"]}
