El aporte de la Antroposof\u00eda\nAbstract\nThe subject is introduced by reflections on the concept of trauma, on the causality and time categories against the background of the anthroposophic view. Different trauma-relevant aspects are then considered. Epistemological factors are discussed and the concept of emergence helps to create the basis for a multifaceted image of man. The central significance of relationship as a factor influencing soul and spirit is considered. Points of view for psychotrauma therapy are developed against this background and in the light of Steiner\u2019s functional threefoldness of the human organism. The aim of psychotrauma therapy is to encourage the patient to let the \u2018I\u2019 take effect: through activity, the activation of the will part in his thinking and feeling, in his movement, focusing on the mind and sentient experience.\nFull Text:\n\u00a9 2010-2023 Research on Steiner Education (RoSE).
