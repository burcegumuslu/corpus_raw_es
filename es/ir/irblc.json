These sounds alter our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies, both positively and negatively.\nEverything in the Universe is made up of vibration; each unique vibration or frequency emits some kind of sound. The sounds emitted may be undetectable to the human ear, which on average can hear between 16 and 16,000 cycles per second (or Hertz). Vibration is not just perceived through just our ears, but also through our whole being, including skin, bones and cellular structures.\nSound Therapy works on the principle of resonance, which is the unique fundamental vibration or frequency with which each aspect, including body parts, charkas and layers of the aura, most naturally want to vibrate.\nWhen an aspect of our being becomes diseased, stressed or imbalanced, an unfamiliar vibration has replaced the natural flow of energy. In order to return balance and harmony, we need to restore the natural fundamental frequency. This can be achieved with the use of Sacred Sound tools through sympathetic resonance, which is when an aspect is brought back into a like vibration.", "language": null, "image": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7dbb55_b73c67f6ec05430dbacd2c08bbd309b7%7Emv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_2500,h_1330,al_c/7dbb55_b73c67f6ec05430dbacd2c08bbd309b7%7Emv2.jpg", "pagetype": "website", "links": ["https://www.alifeofpeace.org?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/aboutus?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/alop-board?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/mailinglist?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/careers?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/donate?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/sponsorship?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/sponsor?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/alop-associate?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/specials?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/classes?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/challenges?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/online?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/naturopath-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/naturopath-certification-confirm?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/soundtherapy?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/nhwc-self-paced-course?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/maternity-reiki?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/holistic-childbirth-education?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/herbalist-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/doula-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/reiki-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/detox-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/detox-video-course?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/naturopathic-clinician?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/reflexology-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/crystal-therapy-course?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/iridology-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/ghana?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/shop?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/memberships?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/members-only?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/financialaid?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/reports-page?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/community?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/doula-house?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/hhbiz?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/rites-of-passage?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/ceremonies?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/contact?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/events-page?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/privacy-policy?lang=es", "https://youtu.be/d8K7_5yt_1M", "https://youtu.be/d8K7_5yt_1M", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/aboutus?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/affiliates?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/ghana?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/careers?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/mailinglist?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/naturopath-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/nhwc-self-paced-course?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/herbalist-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/detox-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/iridology-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/reiki-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/doula-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/crystal-therapy-course?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/retreats?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/crystal-therapy-course?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/naturopath-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/doula-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/naturopathic-clinician?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/herbalist-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/reiki-certification?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/shop?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/contact?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/calendar?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org/privacy-policy?lang=es", "https://www.alifeofpeace.org", "http://www.facebook.com/ALIFEOFPEACE", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaMuWuAz021-mZHQjCZNnow", "https://instagram.com/alifeofpeace1/"]}
