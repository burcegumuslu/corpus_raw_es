Universidad de Le\u00f3n.\nCorrespondence: Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Paz Fern\u00e1ndez \nE-mail:  japazf@unileon.esThe condition of being new in order to accept or reject a paradigm, \nis two sides of the same counterfeit coin.\nSome 9 years have passed since the WHO published its recom-\nmendations on physical activity for health, offering the general public \nsome minimum recommended targets for daily physical activity. The \nmain new feature of this guide is the inclusion of the recommendation to perform muscle-strengthening activities (musculoskeletal stren -\ngthening) at least two or three times a week, regardless of age (in fact from 5 years upwards)\n1. Even so, these recommendations are all too \nfrequently not included in the general exercise guidelines provided by \nmedical practitioners.\nAnd it is even more disturbing to see how old beliefs, that are \nnow known to be false, are still being maintained and conveyed, with regard to \u201chow strength training for children is a bad thing\u201d as it affects \nthe growth cartilage, or produces myocardial hypertrophy ... or \u201cstren -\ngthening activities are really bad for those with high blood pressure or \nheart conditions\u201d etc. Numerous studies that demonstrate the safety \nand benefits of exercises of this type on healthy children\n2-4, obese \nindividuals5, or with heart diseases6, have been published. However, \ndespite all this scientific and professional evidence, it has not been \npossible to do away with these misconceptions.\nLuckily for the health of the general public, physical exercise is \ncurrently being recommended for patients affected by most chronic or degenerative disorders. However, medical practitioners are still not \nclearly recommending muscle-strengthening activities and, in some cases, they are even expressly advising against such exercises. This point \ncan be illustrated by a survey conducted on 272,887 non-hypertensive \nand 179,789 hypertensive Americans. The respondents were asked whether, during their visit to the doctor, they had been recommended to exercise and, if so, whether they were recommended to do only aerobic exercises, solely strengthening exercises or a combination of \nthe two\n7. 36.9% of the healthy respondents had not been advised to \nexercise, neither had 45.7% of the hypertensive respondents. Of those who had been advised to exercise, 23.1% and 15% were recommended \nto do combined exercises and 9.5% and 7.3% solely strengthening exer -\ncises, for healthy and hypertensive respondents respectively. And this is \ndespite the consensus agreements on exercise published by the various \nmedical specialty or patient welfare societies. Even so, unfortunately it is not uncommon for patients suffering from a chronic disease or with \nafter-effects to be advised against strengthening exercises. This is despite \nthe evidence to the contrary found in scientific publications, showing how important and safe it is to do strengthening exercises, either on \ntheir own or together with the traditional aerobic exercises. Such is the \ncase for patients suffering from ischemic heart disease\n8,9, hypertension10, \ndiabetes11, arthrosis12, osteoporosis13, multiple sclerosis14, cancer survi -\nvors in general15 and breast cancer survivors in particular16,17,chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease18,19, chronic kidney disease20\u2026 and a \nlong list of other diseases and disorders.\nDue to the discrepancy between what is known through science \nand what is recommended by medical practitioners, there are reduced possibilities of functional improvement and an improvement in the \nquality of life of the healthy population and infirm population alike. It \nwould be advisable for those in sports medicine to intensify their peda-gogical efforts towards general and specialty medicine with regard to \nthe prescription of strengthening exercises. There are sufficient scientific \nconsensuses, stances and recommendations to make it possible to correctly prescribe strength training in the healthcare context, for the \ngeneral public\n21,22, children23, and cardiac patients24.La fuerza, la olvidada en la prescripci\u00f3n del ejercicio f\u00edsico para la salud67\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):66-67Although it is true that the benefits of exercise on health are related \nto the duration, intensity and frequency of the exercises, it is no less true \nthat there is a relationship between the amount of strength training \nand its benefits on health. Not every exercise in which a resistance is successively overcome can be considered to be suitable strength training \nor a beneficial exercise to improve strength.\nStrength training or exercises are not contraindicated. However poor \ntraining (incorrect load selection, incorrect load progression, incorrect te -\nchnical execution, inadequate and unsafe means, etc.) is contraindicated.  \nBibliography \n 1 .

Las herramientas Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C) y K\u00f6rperkoordinationtest f\u00fcr kinder (KTK) se usaron para evaluar los niveles de actividad f\u00edsica y coordinaci\u00f3n motriz, respecti -\nvamente.

The Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C) and K\u00f6rperkoordinationtest f\u00fcr kinder (KTK) tools were \nused in order to assess the levels of physical activity and motor coordination, respectively. Bivariate and partial correlations were used to analyze the interrelationships among motor coordination, BMI and physical activity. The analysis of covariance \ntest was used in order to compare the levels of motor coordination among normal weight, overweight and obese adolescents, \nconsidering the physical activity level as a covariate. \nResults: Moderate negative correlations (p<0.05) were found between motor coordination and BMI in the sample as a whole, \nnormal weight and obese groups. However, when controlled for physical activity levels, it was not observed a significant co -\nrrelation in the normal weight group. Motor coordination and BMI were not significantly correlated in overweight adolescents \nwith and without controlling for physical activity levels. Furthermore, motor coordination level demonstrated a trend to be \nlower in overweight and obese adolescents. \nConclusion: Physical activity level influenced the association between motor coordination and BMI in normal weight \nadolescents, but not in overweight and obese. The negative effect of excess body mass on motor coordination level may \noverlap the possible influence that physical activity level exerts on the association between motor coordination and BMI in \noverweight and obese adolescents.Key words:  \nMotor coordination.

Chagas, et al.70\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):69-73Introduction\nPediatric obesity has become a global epidemic1, being recognized \nas one of the most serious public health concerns in the 21st century2. \nIn Brazil, more than 8 million children and adolescents are estimated to \nbe obese3. This high prevalence is a concern due its associated health \nrisks such as hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, type \nII diabetes and dyslipidemia2.\nObesity seems also to be associated with poor motor coordination \nin children and adolescents4-6. Although few studies7,8 have not found \nsignificant associations between motor coordination level and body mass index (BMI), most evidence suggests these variables are negatively \nassociated\n9-14. Overall, these previous studies suggest obese children \ntend to have lower motor coordination level than their normal weight \npeers.\nA plausible explanation for a negative association between BMI \nand motor coordination level in children and adolescents is based on biomechanical issues. That is, the higher the amount of body mass, \nthe higher the mechanical work required to performing motor tasks, especially those which demand body weight-bearing. Evidence\n10,15,16 has \nconfirmed, at least partially, this weight-bearing hypothesis. However, \nthe reported negative relationship between motor coordination level \nand BMI can be mediated by several alternative mechanisms17.\nOne of mechanisms that can mediate, or influence, the relationship \nbetween motor coordination level and BMI in pediatric population is the physical activity level\n4,18. This assumption is based on evidence that \nphysical activity level is positively associated with motor coordination \nlevel19,20. Also, it is important to recognize that not all obese children and \nadolescents have poor motor coordination or are physically inactive21. \nTherefore, the hypothesis that physical activity level may influence the association between motor coordination level and BMI in children and \nadolescents seems to be plausible.\nChagas and Batista\n22 found physical activity level influences the as -\nsociation between motor coordination level and BMI in normal weight, \nbut not in their overweight/obese peers. However, the comparisons \nrealized in that study involved overweight and obese adolescents in the same group. Therefore, it remains unknown if physical activity level \ncan influence the associations between motor coordination level and \nBMI in obese adolescents. \nThe purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of physical \nactivity level on associations between motor coordination and BMI in normal weight, overweight and obese adolescents.\nMaterial and method\nOne hundred and fifty five adolescents (69 boys and 86 girls) \nbetween seventh and ninth grade of elementary school (age ranged \nbetween 12 and 15 years old) from a Brazilian public school were \ninitially recruited to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria re -\nquired students to be under 15 years old with no history of injury \nor disease that could affect motor performance. Exclusion criteria \nconsisted of subject\u2019s weight status classified as underweight. Eth -\nical approval for this study was obtained from the University\u2019s Ethics Committee and parental consent and child assent were obtained prior to participation. \nAfter initial recruitment (N=155), eight subjects were excluded \nfrom the study due to their being underweight. Further, thirteen obese adolescents were detected (n=13). Thus, among the 134 remaining subjects (28 overweight and 106 normal weight), 13 overweight and \n13 normal weight adolescents were randomly selected to compose \nthe final sample of 39 participants (17 boys and 22 girls). There was not missing data. \nBody mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using an electronic \nscale, with participants wearing their school uniform. Standing height was measured while unshod with a stadiometer wall to the nearest \n0.1 cm. BMI (kg/m\n2) was then calculated. World Health Organization23 \nage-specific cut-off points for BMI were used in order to determine the weight status of participants (underweight, normal weight, overweight \nand obesity) according to gender. \nThe Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C), a \nvalid\n24 self-applied 7-day recall instrument, was used to assess general \nlevels of physical activity of participants. The PAQ-C is appropriate \nfor elementary school-aged children approximately between 8\u201314 \nyears old who are currently in the school system and have recess as a regular part of their school week. The summary score from the PAQ-C \nis the average of the sum of the nine item questions, each scored on \na 5-point scale, with 1 being the lower level of physical activity and 5 the higher level. \nMotor coordination level was assessed using the K\u00f6rperkoordi -\nnationstest f\u00fcr Kinder (KTK). The KTK is appropriated to assess motor coordination level of participants because it is a reliable and valid \ninstrument, with a teste-retest reliability coefficient of 0.97\n25. KTK is one \nof most used tools for assessing children\u2019s motor coordination26 and it \nconsists of four test items. The first is walking backwards along balance beams (3m length) of decreasing width (6, 4.5 and 3 cm). Each beam \nwas crossed three times where a maximum of eight steps per trial were allowed (72 steps overall); the sum of steps in all trials determined score \n1. The second involved one-legged hopping over an obstacle, formed \nby an increasing pile of pillows (pillow size 60 cm \u00d7 20 cm \u00d7 5 cm; the maximum was 12 pillows or a height of 60 cm). Only three trials were \nallowed for each obstacle and three, two, or one point(s) were/was \nawarded for successful performance on the first, second, or third try, respectively. Therefore, a maximum of 39 points (including a ground \nlevel trial) could be scored for each leg; the points were summed to determine score 2. The third task was two-legged sideways jumping \nacross a wooden slat (60 cm \u00d7 4 cm \u00d7 2 cm) for 15 s as quickly as possi -\nble. The number of jumps performed correctly was summed over two \ntrials to determine score 3. The final task involved moving sideways on \nwooden boards (25 cm \u00d7 25 cm \u00d7 5.7 cm) as many times as possible \nin 20 s. One point was awarded for each time the plate was transferred and one more for stepping on it. The number of relocations was count -\ned and summed over two trials to determine score 4. KTK takes into account motor coordination level is gender and age-related. Thus, the four scores acquired in each item test were gender and age-adjusted in \naccording to KTK normative database. Finally, the motor coordination \nlevel for each participant was derived from the sum of the four adjusted scores obtained in the tests.Relationships among motor coordination, body mass index and physical activity in adolescents with different weight status 71\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):69-73Descriptive statistics were determined for all variables. The Kol -\nmogorov\u2013Smirnov test confirmed acceptable normality of the data \ndistribution. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were used to examine the \nbivariate relationships between levels of motor coordination, BMI and physical activity. Partial correlations were used to analyse the relations-\nhip between motor coordination level and BMI, controlling for physical \nactivity levels. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare the motor coordination levels between normal weight, overweight and \nobese adolescents, considering the physical activity level as a covariate. \nA significance level of 5% ( \u03b1 = 0.05) was adopted in all statistical tests. \nData analysis was executed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences \nsoftware (SPSS ver. 22.0, IBM, USA).\nResults\nThe total sample (N=39) presented the following values for age, \nbody weight, height, BMI, motor coordination and physical activity levels, respectively: 13.7y (\u00b10.6), 63.2kg (\u00b117.5), 1.61m (\u00b10.8), 24.1kg/\nm\n2 (\u00b15.9), 78.6 (\u00b122.0) and 2.7 (\u00b10.9). Descriptive statistics of group 1 \n(normal weight), group 2 (overweight) and group 3 (obese) are provi -\nded in Table 1.\nAs shown in Figure 1, motor coordination levels decline as weight \nstatus worsens, that is, as higher BMI, the lower motor coordination \nlevels. However, results of ANCOVA test confirmed significant differences \nin motor coordination levels only between normal weight and obese groups (F=4.123, p=0.025). \nPearson and partial correlations coefficients are displayed in Table \n2. Moderate negative correlations were found between BMI and motor coordination levels in the group as a whole, as well as in the normal \nweight and obese groups. However, when statistically controlled for \nphysical activity levels, significant correlations were only observed in the group as a whole and obese group.\nDiscussion\nThe main aim of this study was to analyze the influence of physical \nactivity level on associations between motor coordination and BMI in \nadolescents with different weight status. Our findings suggested motor \ncoordination level and BMI are negatively associated in normal weight and obese adolescents. However, the association between these va-\nriables was not significant when controlled for physical activity level in \nnormal weight adolescents. On the other hand, motor coordination level and BMI were significantly negatively correlated in obese adolescents \nregardless of physical activity level. These results suggest physical activity \nlevel can influence the association between motor coordination and BMI in normal weight adolescents. Furthermore, motor coordination \nlevel demonstrated a trend to be decline as weight status worsens.\nModerate negative correlations between motor coordination level \nand BMI were observed in the group as a whole, normal weight and obese adolescents. These findings are in line with previous studies\n9-14. \nConsidering BMI as an indicator of body fat, it seems plausible to ex -\npect that individuals with higher BMI, i.e. higher adiposity, have higher \ndifficulty to perform some motor tasks due to increased biomechanical Table 1.

That is, the higher BMI, higher physical difficulties experienced \nby individuals, such as increased moments of inertia and mechanical \nwork, especially in weight-bearing tasks.\nNevertheless, our findings showed that motor coordination and \nBMI were not significantly correlated in overweight adolescents. Few previous studies\n7,8 have also not found significant associations between \nmotor coordination level and BMI. These findings can be explained by the fact that individuals with the same weight status, or even with the \nsame BMI, may have considerable differences in body composition. That is, overweight individuals with relatively high levels of lean mass \nand low levels of body fat may have no increased difficulty to perform \nmotor tasks due their BMI status. \nNegative correlations between motor coordination levels and BMI \nremained weak to moderate when controlled for physical activity level in all groups. However, motor coordination level and BMI were not significantly correlated in normal weight adolescents when controlled \nfor physical activity level. This evidence suggests physical activity level \ncan influence the association between motor coordination and BMI in normal weight adolescents, but not in overweight and obese. These \nfindings are in line with a previous study\n22, corroborating the assump -\ntion that, in obese adolescents, motor coordination level and BMI are negatively associated regardless of physical activity levels. These results \ncan be explained by negative effect of excess body mass on motor coordination level; it may overlap the possible influence that physical \nactivity level exerts on the association between motor coordination and \nBMI in overweight and obese adolescents. \nIn line with previous findings\n5,10,17, our results showed motor coordi -\nnation level tend to decline as weight status worsens. These results add \nto the body of evidence suggesting obese adolescents tend to have \npoorer motor coordination level than their normal weight peers. These findings were expected due to increased biomechanical demands in \nsome motor tasks experienced by individuals with higher BMI. Howe -\nver, significant differences in motor coordination level were observed \nonly between normal weight and obese groups. That is, there were no \nsignificant differences in motor coordination level when overweight \nadolescents were compared with normal weight and obese peers. These findings can also be explained by possible differences in body \ncomposition, especially with regard to body fat, among participants \nwhose weight status was classified as overweight.\nIn this study was hypothesized that the physical activity level, as a \nmediator mechanism, could influence the associations between motor coordination and BMI in adolescents with different weight status. Our findings corroborated only partially this hypothesis, because physical \nactivity level influenced only the associations among normal weight \nadolescents. Besides the increased negative effect of body fat in overweight and obese, other complementary mechanisms, as percei -\nved motor competence and physical fitness, can have influenced the approached relationship. \nAnother way to explain our findings concerns the role of physical \nactivity level in this interrelationship. Indeed, it is expected the higher physical activity level among adolescents, higher their opportunities for practice. Considering that opportunities for practice is essential \nfor motor development\n27, it is expected that physical activity level is \nassociated with motor coordination. However, the levels of physical activity showed for adolescents may not necessarily to be linked with \ndiversified and increased opportunities for practice. Thus, the influence \nof physical activity on relationship between motor coordination and BMI can be low or inexistent. In this sense, the role of physical activity as a mediator mechanism, such as proposed in the conceptual framework proposed by Stodden et al.\n28, may vary in according to opportunities \nfor practice experienced by individuals. \nThis study had some limitations. First, motor coordination and phy -\nsical activity were assessed using a test composed by gross motor skills and a self-reported questionnaire, respectively. Thus, the inference of our results is limited to these specific measures in adolescents. Second, both instruments used for assessing physical activity and motor coordination \nwere not adapted to Brazilian population. Also, the small sample size \nwas relatively small. Future investigations using different measurement tools should be conducted in order to corroborate or refuse our results. \nConclusions\nPhysical activity level influenced the association between mo -\ntor coordination and BMI in normal weight adolescents, but not in \noverweight and obese. The increased negative effects of excess body \nmass, as well as the variability of opportunities for practice according \nto physical activity level, seem to explain these findings. Also, comple -\nmentary analyses assessing the potential mediating effects of physical activity on the relationship between motor coordination and BMI should \nbe considered in future studies. As practical application, physical edu-\ncators and physicians must encourage not only a health weight status, \nbut also the development of motor coordination among adolescents. Moreover, elevated levels of physical activity associated with diversified \nand increased opportunities for practice should also be promoted by \nhealth car e professionals, as physical educators and physicians. \nConflict of interest\nThe authors do not declare a conflict of interest.\nBibliography\n 1 .

The aim of this study was to compare two protocols \n(without or with 15 minutes of warm-up) for the tlim determination at 100% of Vpeak in untrained men. \nMaterial and method: Twelve untrained young men performed three running tests on a treadmill: one maximal incremental \ntest to determine Vpeak and two rectangular tests, performed in randomized order, without a warm-up (tlim0) or with a 15-minute \nwarm-up duration (tlim15) at 60% of Vpeak to determine the tlim at 100% of Vpeak, after the warm-up the tests were performed at \nthe speed of the individual Vpeak until volitional exhaustion. During the tests, heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion \n(RPE) were monitored and blood lactate sampling was collected prior to session (LApre); immediately post-exercise (LA0-min); \n3 min (LA3-min), 5 min (LA5-min) and 7 min (LA7-min) post-exercise to determine lactate concentrations. The Shapiro-Wilk test was \nused and confirmed the normality of the data distribution, with maximal and submaximal values compared using Student\u00b4s \nt test for dependent samples. Results: Test duration at t\nlim0 was significant higher than that at tlim15 (P = 0.02). Additionally, different tlim protocols influenced \nHR and RPE submaximal responses and did not modify lactate concentrations or maximal variables (HRmax and RPEmax). \nConclusions: These findings suggest that the determination of tlim at 100% of Vpeak without a prior warm-up led to a higher \ntest duration in untrained men.Key words:  \nRunning.

Such prescriptions should be planned \nfor each individual according to the physiological (e.g ., heart rate [HR]), \npsychological ( e.g., rating of perceived exertion [RPE]), and performance \nvariables (peak speed [Vpeak], time limit [tlim]) that control and monitor \neffort intensity3.\nThe tlim is the maximal time that an individual can maintain a given \nexercise intensity4, such as Vpeak occurrence velocity. The original protocol \nfor the tlim determination included a prior 15-minute warm-up at an \nintensity equivalent to 60% of the reference velocity ( e.g., Vpeak or velocity \nassociated with the occurrence of maximal oxygen uptake [vVO2max]); \nafter the warm-up, without interval, the velocity is automatically increa -\nsed to 100% intensity, at which the individual should remain as long as \npossible until volitional exhaustion4. However, warm-up duration (5, 10 \nor 15 minutes) modified the test duration (tlim)5.\nStudies demonstrated that various warm-up types, such as stret -\nching (static and dynamic)6, whole-body vibration7, and the traditional \nwarm-up consisting of low-intensity cycling8, could positively or \nnegatively influence aerobic performance. For instance, Tomaras & \nMacintosh8 investigated a sample of highly trained male track cyclists \nand compared the traditional warm-up (WU) for a 200-m sprint in a track cycling competition with an experimental WU that was designed to be \nshorter and less intense and examined the fatigue and cycling perfor -\nmance after traditional and experimental WU. Results from this study \nshowed that peak active twitch torque was lower after the traditional \nthan experimental WU when expressed as percentage of pre-warm-up amplitude, and Wingate test performance was better after experimental \nWU than traditional WU; indeed, the traditional track cyclist\u2019s WU results \nin significant fatigue, which corresponds with impaired peak power out -\nput, and shorter and lower intensity WU permits a better performance.\nHowever, a recent study showed that warm-up duration (5, 10 or \n15 minutes) modified the test duration (t\nlim) of untrained men in which \nthe warm-up comprising 15 minutes led the participants to exercise for \na shorter time compared to other tlim protocols5. Since tlim is a variable \nthat is used to determine the optimal stimulus durations in interval training sessions\n9-11, this longer or short duration altered by warm-up \nwill directly impact this prescription.\nNevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is still a lack of \nstudies that analyzed the best duration of the warm-up5 and knowing \nthe importance of warm-ups prior to exercise and that the duration modifies the t\nlim5, the aim of this study was to compare two protocols \n(without and with a 15-minute warm-up) for the tlim determination at \n100% of Vpeak in untrained men. Our hypothesis is that the tlim determi-\nned without a warm-up will differ from that of the tlim performed with \na 15-minute warm-up.\nMaterial and method\nTwelve untrained young men, not included in systematic running \ntraining programs, with training volume less than 20 km per week, volunteered to participate in this study. The 5-km running times re -\nported by participants were between 25 and 35 minutes, with a pace \nbetween 8.6 and 12 km\u2022h-1 (\u2245 36.1 and 50.4 % of the world record). \nThe main characteristics of the participants were: age 21.4 \u00b1 2.3 years, \nheight 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 m, body mass 76.7 \u00b1 10.9 kg, body mass index (BMI) \n24.2 \u00b1 2.8 kg\u2022m-2 and body fat 15.3 \u00b1 4.2%. Prior to testing, written \ninformed consent was obtained from all participants. The experimental \nprotocol was approved by the local Human Research Ethics Comittee \n(#1.262.502/2015) and appropriate standards for human experimen -\ntation have been followed.\nExperimental overview\nParticipants performed three tests on a motorized treadmill (Super \nATL Inbrasport, Porto Alegre, Brazil), with the gradient set at 1%. In the \nfirst visit the evaluation of the anthropometric measurements was per -\nformed, and the participants were submitted to a maximal incremental \ntest to determine Vpeak. After, in a randomized order, two rectangular \ntests with warm-up durations of 15 minutes and without warm-up \nwere performed to determine the tlim at 100% of  Vpeak. The tests were \nperformed over 2 weeks, with each test separated from the other by 48 hours. For all tests, participants were instructed to stay well-rested, \nwell-nourished, and well-hydrated, wearing lightweight comfortable clothing. Participants were also instructed to avoid eating for 2 hours \nbefore the maximal exercise test, to abstain from caffeine and alcohol \nand to refrain from strenuous exercise for 48 hours before testing. Tests were conducted at the same time of the day, under normal laboratory \nconditions (temperature 20-22 \u00baC, relative humidity 50-60%).\nIncremental exercise test to determine Vpeak\nAfter a warm-up, comprised walking at 6 km\u2219h-1 for three minutes, \nthe continuous protocol started with a speed of 8 km\u2219h-1 and increased \nby 1 km\u2219h-1 between each successive 3-minute stage until participants \nreached volitional exhaustion12. The Vpeak of the incremental test was cal -\nculated as the speed of the last complete stage added to the completed fraction of the incomplete stage\n13, calculated according to the equation: \nVpeak = Vcomplete + (t/T\u00d7speed increment)\nwhere Vcomplete is the running speed of the last complete stage, t \nthe time in seconds sustained during the incomplete stage, and T the time in seconds required to complete a stage (i.e., 180 seconds), and \nspeed incremental is the speed load increment. The maximal effort was deemed to be achieved if the incremental test met two of the following criteria: 1) LA\npeak \u2265 8 mmol\u2022L-1 14 2) HRmax \u2265 100% of endurance-trained \nage-predicted HRmax using the age-based (207 - 0.7 \u00d7 age) equation15 \nand 3) RPEmax \u2265 19 in the 6-20 Borg Scale16.\nRectangular tests to determine the tlim at Vpeak\nThe two rectangular tests differed only by presence or absence \nof the warm-up of 15 minutes. After the warm-up at 60% of Vpeak, the \ntreadmill speed was quickly increased (in approximately 6 seconds) \nto the individual at 100% of  Vpeak4. Participants were also encouraged \nto invest maximal effort and the time of permanency in this intensity was considered the t\nlim at 100% of  Vpeak.Guilherme H.S. Kimura, et al.76\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):74-78Psychophysiological and physiological variables\nBefore testing participants were familiarized with the 6\u201320 Borg \nscale16, which was used to determine the rating of perceived exertion \n(RPE) during the last 15 seconds the stages of Vpeak and every minute \nin tlim. The highest RPE value was adopted as the maximal RPE (RPEmax). \nHeart rate (HR) was monitored throughout the tests (Polar RS800sd, \nKempele, Finland) and in the last 10 seconds of each stage da Vpeak \nand every minute in tlim HR was registered; the maximal heart rate \n(HRmax) was defined as the highest HR value observed during the \ntests15. Earlobe capillary blood samples (25 \u00b5L) were collected in a \ncapillary tube to determine the lactate concentrations. These samples were collected before (LA\npre) all exercise tests, after the incremental \ntest at the third (LA3-min) and fifth (LA5-min) minutes, and at the end \n(LA0-min), at the LA3-min, LA5-min and seventh (LA7-min) minutes after the \nrectangular tests. For the LApre, the participants remained at rest for \n15 minutes in a comfortable chair prior to the sampling procedure. For the LA\n0-min blood sampled collection the participants remained \nstanding upright on the treadmill, and for the LA3-min, LA5-min, LA7-min \nsamples the participants remained sitting in a comfortable chair. Peak blood lactate concentration (LA\npeak) was defined for each participant \nas the highest post-exercise blood lactate concentration value. The samples were subsequently determined by electroenzymatic \nmethods using the YSI 2300 STAT (Ohio, USA) automated analyzer \n(accuracy \u00b1 2%).\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 SD and were analyzed using the \nStatistical Package for the Social Sciences software v. 20.0 (SPSS Inc., \nChicago, IL, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used and confirmed the normality of the data distribution. Maximal and submaximal values were compared using Student\u00b4s t  test for dependent samples. Statis-\ntical significance was set at P  < 0.05.\nResults\nThe variables obtained during the exhaustion incremental test to \ndetermine the Vpeak were: Vpeak = 12.7 \u00b1 1.2 km\u2022h-1, test duration = 17.1 \n\u00b1 3.8 min, HRmax = 187 \u00b1 8.7 bpm, RPEmax = 19.8 \u00b1 0.5 and LApeak = 8.6 \n\u00b1 3.2 mmol\u2022L-1.\nTable 1 compares tlim test duration, maximal variables (HRmax, RPEmax, \nand LApeak) and post-test lactate concentrations obtained during the \ntwo tests. Test duration at tlim0 was significantly higher than that at tlim15 \n(P = 0.02). However, no significant difference was seen in the other \nvariables.\nComparisons between HR and RPE values obtained during the \ntwo tests for tlim determination are shown in Table 2. Only the minutes \nin which the participants remained throughout the two tests were \nanalyzed. Significant differences were noted in the HR and RPE values \nuntil the fifth minute ( P \u2264 0.01), in the RPE value at the sixth minute  \n(P = 0.04), and in HR value at seventh minute (P = 0.02). Discussion\nThis study aimed to compare the two protocols (without and \nwith a 15-minute warm-up) in the tlim determination at 100% of Vpeak \nin untrained men. The main finding of the present study was that the \ndifferent protocols for the tlim determination had different test durations; Table 1.

Furthermore, the tlim protocol influenced the HR and RPE \nduring the test responses but did not modify lactate concentrations or the maximal variables (HR\nmax and RPEmax).\nPrevious investigations determined tlim using a standard protocol \nwith a 15-minute warm-up duration at 60% of maximal aerobic speed (MAS), vVO\n2max, or Vpeak4,5,17. Other studies used different warm-up dura -\ntions (tlim10 and tlim5)5,18,19, but none omitted the warm-up (tlim0). This is \nthe first study to investigate performance in a protocol for determining t\nlim without a previous warm-up and compared it with the standard \nprotocol (tlim15)4. Our results demonstrated that the runners participated \nfor a longer duration in the protocol without a warm-up than in the protocol with a warm-up. This result was similar to those of Da Cruz \net al.\n5 and Bertuzzi et al.18, who used shorter warm-up protocols ( i.e., \ntlim10 and tlim5) when testing untrained young men and recreational \nlong-distance runners, respectively. When investigating the influence \nof different warm-up durations on determining tlim (i.e., tlim15, tlim10, tlim5), \nDa Cruz et al.5 reported a longer participation time in the protocol with \na shorter warm-up duration for tlim determination. Similarly, Bertuzzi \net al.18 observed that the participants remained in the protocol with a \n5-minute warm-up longer than they did in the protocol with a 10-mi -\nnute warm-up. Thus, a longer warm-up time for the tlim determination \nshowed a negative effect on test duration and may be a tiring factor prior to exercise. The longer warm-up duration seems to cause greater \nphysiological wear in the participants at the beginning of the test as demonstrated by the higher values of HR and RPE in the t\nlim15 protocol \nthan in the tlim0 protocol observed in the present study.\nIn addition to warm-up duration, tlim seems to be influenced by \nparticipant fitness level since there was an inverse correlation between \nMAS and tlim4,20,21. Renoux et al.20 reported a mean tlim15 value of 4.5 \u00b1 1.3 \nminutes in trained runners, similar to that observed by Billat et al.4 (i.e., \n5.01 \u00b1 0.9 minutes) in a study of trained runners that showed a shorter tlim \nduration than the results of our study for the tlim15 protocol (i.e., 6.0 \u00b1 2.0 \nminutes) as well as the study of Da Cruz et al.5 (i.e., 5.9 \u00b1 1.7 minutes) that \nevaluated untrained young males. These results show that it is possible \nto observe a difference in tlim duration despite use of the same protocol \n(tlim15) due to differences in participant fitness levels. \nSince tlim is a variable that is used to determine the optimal stimulus \ndurations in interval training sessions9-11, this longer duration found by a \nlack of a warm-up will directly impact this prescription. Previous studies using t\nlim to prescribe interval training showed that if these sessions do \nnot have the ideal duration, runners may not complete the training and/or show no improvement because of a low stimulus intensity\n10,11,22. \nBillat et al.10 tested the training effect in that the stimuli had a duration of \n50% of tlim in vVO2max in the interval training sessions, and no differences \nwere found in the aerobic variables associated with performance after 4 weeks of training. Similarly, some authors\n11,22 tested different combi-\nnations of vVO2max and its respective tlim for individualized training with \nseries of 60 and 75%; 60 and 70% of tlim in vVO2max, respectively. As a \nresult, performance improvements were observed only for the groups that trained with the series duration at 60% of t\nlim in vVO2max. The results \nof these studies suggest that small changes in tlim duration can have a \ngreat impact on the training prescription. Thus, the correct choice of the protocol for determining the tlim is important because the warm-up time \n(its lack or presence) will directly affect the tlim duration and, therefore, \nthe training prescription.\nRegarding HR, RPE, and lactate concentration responses during the \ntest, the protocols with different warm-up durations ( i.e., tlim0 and tlim15) \nwere not expected to affect the maximal variables (HRmax, RPEmax, and \nLApeak). However, when the during the test HR and RPE responses were \nanalyzed during the different warm-up times, we obtained smaller values \nin the tlim0 protocol compared to the tlim15 protocol. A similar result was \nfound by Da Cruz et al.5, who observed higher values for these variables \nin the protocol with a 15-minute warm-up compared to protocols with 5- and 10-minute warm-ups. This change can be explained by the increase in cardiovascular activity after exercises with durations > 10 minutes caused by changes in thermoregulatory mechanisms, energy substrates, and increased blood flow\n23,24, which also affected the parti-\ncipants final performances. \nDespite the important findings of our study, one limitation was that \nthe determination of the Vpeak (and warm-up based on Vpeak) could led to \ndifferent individual intensities relative to the velocity of anaerobic thres -\nhold (vAT). Thus, despite of Vpeak and vAT are correlated with endurance \nrunning performance12,25 no previous study examined the relationship \nbetween Vpeak and vAT. Future studies should investigate the relation -\nship between Vpeak and vAT and to better understand how differences \nin relative intensities of vAT could affect the time limit performance.\nConclusion \nTherefore, we conclude that the lack of a 15-minute warm-up, ba-\nsed on the protocol proposed by Billat et al.4, for determining tlim leads \nto a longer test duration at 100% of Vpeak and modifies the responses \nduring the test variables (HR, RPE) in untrained men. This result may \nimpact or interfere with the use of tlim for interval training prescriptions. \nHence, we suggest that further studies should be performed in training protocols with different warm-up durations to evaluate the impact of \nthe use of time limits.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors do not declare a conflict of interest.\nBibliography\n 1.

Physical exercise has shown beneficial effects in the regulation of lipemic markers in different populations; however, its effects are not well understood in postmenopausal women. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of resisted exercises (RE), concurrent exercises (CE), compared with a control group (CG) on lipid profile in postme -\nnopausal women. Thirty-two voluntary postmenopausal women were randomly assigned into three groups; one group performed a RE session (n = 11), other group a CE session (n = 11) and control group performed flexibility exercises (n = 10). The basal lipid profile, body composition, muscular fitness were evaluated and the basal metabolic rate (BMR) was calculated before the study. The lipid profile was evaluated before, immediately after and 12 hours after the specific exercise session. The results showed that there was no a statistical significant difference among all groups in plasma concentration of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL, in any of the evaluation moments (p> 0.05). After 12 hours of exercise session, the CE group decreased more VLDL concentrations than the RE group and control group (p <0.05). The CE group increased significantly HDL concentrations in relation to the ER group (p <0.05). Therefore, it can be concluded that CE had more favorable acute effects on lipid metabolism than ER, prolonging its effect up to 12 hours after being performed in overweight postmenopausal women.

The performance of an \naerobic exercise session can reduce the lipid plasma concentrations associated with atherosclerosis pathogenesis, such as low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)\n5, as well as \nincreasing the activity of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) which play a significant role in the systemic regulation of excess cholesterol\n6. More \nrecent studies have reported favourable changes in the lipid profile after a single aerobic exercise session\n7,8.\nOn the other hand, muscle strengthening exercises with external \nresistances or resistance exercises (RE) are primarily associated with res -\nponses in the functional sense of anaerobic resistance and strength9. RE \nare classed as a means for the prevention of chronic diseases and acute catastrophic events, such as infarcts or cerebrovascular ischemia\n10. The \npreventive role of RE could be due to their impact on the assimilation of lipids and the regulation of the pro- and anti-inflammatory markers on the organism, during, and primarily after exercising\n11,12. Only a few \nstudies have assessed how an RE session modifies the lipid markers in the blood stream.\nThe combination of RE and aerobic exercises, currently known as \nconcurrent exercises (CE), has been shown to have beneficial effects on \nthe state of health and general physical condition if performed regu -\nlarly\n13. However, benefits have been observed, as well as improvements \nin the lipid profile and general physical fitness in vulnerable populations, \nsuch as persons with obesity and postmenopausal women14.\nAfter the menopause, the risk of women developing CVD increases4. \nThis increased vulnerability is related to the reduction in oestrogen le -\nvels, a hormone that appears to exercise a protective role against CVD in \nwomen, by promoting an atherogenic lipid profile, an anti-inflammatory immunological profile and by direct action on the blood vessel walls, thereby avoiding the dysfunction of the vascular endothelium\n15. The \nassociated physiological, metabolic and morphological changes are characterised by a fall in the level of physical activity, increased body mass index (BMI), a decrease in muscle mass (sarcopenia), a decrease in the basal metabolic rate, an increase in triglyceride concentrations (TG) and LDL\n12. The inclusion of physical exercise in the life style of this \npopulation, may have a positive effect on a number of cardiovascular risk factors, such as a reduction in body fat and the acute regulation of some of the lipemia markers\n6.This study is directed at determining the acute effect of an RE ses -\nsion and a CE session on the lipid profile of postmenopausal women, \ncompared to a control group.   \nMaterial and method\nThis investigation corresponds to a quasi-experimental study with \nsingle blind randomisation, exposure-response based on the acute \nchanges provided in two experimental groups, two types of physical \nexercise with specific biochemical blood markers, compared to a control group.\nSubjects\nThe sample comprised a total of 32 postmenopausal women \nvolunteers, workers from the Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital Universitario Metro -\npolitano in the city of Barranquilla, with an average age of 54.66 \u00b1 4.04 \nyears, recruited through the occupational welfare office. The inclusion \ncriteria were postmenopausal women with no hormone replacement treatment. Excluded from the study were those women who had taken part in some type of resistance training during the 6 months prior to \nthe study and those with a medical history of serious endocrine, me -\ntabolic and/or neuromuscular disorders, determined during screening \nby a doctor specialising in internal medicine. Before taking part, each of the subjects of the study was carefully informed of the study design, particularly the possible risks and discomforts related to the procedures, \nsubsequently giving their written informed consent.  \nEthical considerations  \nThis study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards \nof exercise sciences16, of the World Medical Association and of the \nDeclaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Institutional \nInvestigation and Ethics Committee of the Universidad Metropolitana \nde Barranquilla, Colombia.\nExperimental design\nThe total number of study subjects (n=32) were randomly divided \ninto 3 groups, two experimental groups who performed a session of \nresistance exercises (RE, n=11) and a session of concurrent exercises \n(CE, n=11), respectively; and a control group with no exercises with \nsignificant energy expenditure (CG, n=10). \nPrior to the experimental protocol, an appointment was made for \nthe women for an initial assessment of the musculoskeletal variables \n(maximum dynamic force and lower-limb functional capacity), body \ncomposition (% of fat and lean mass), anthropometric assessment \n(height, weight, waist circumference), basal metabolic rate and moni-toring of dietary behaviour based on the protocols described below.\nMaximum dynamic force \nIn order to determine the maximum dynamic force of the women\u2019s \ndifferent body segments, maximum repetition tests (1RM) were used Acute effects of resistance and concurrent exercise on the lipid profile of postmenopausal women81\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):79-85for the muscle groups performing the resistance exercises on which the \nexperimental groups were based. The maximum load for each subject \nwas determined with no more than 5 tries with a 4-minute recovery \nbetween tries. \nMaximum dynamic force \nIn order to determine the maximum dynamic force of the different \nbody segments of the women, tests of a maximum repetition (1RM) \nwere used for the muscular groups that perform the resisted exercises \non which the experimental groups are based. The maximum load of \neach subject was determined with no more than 5 attempts with a \nrecovery of 4 minutes between attempts. \nAssessment of the lower-limb functional capacity \nThe 30 second sit-to-stand test measures the functional capacity \nof the lower limbs. The test was performed as follows: the initial posi -\ntion was seated in the centre of a chair (height 43 cm), with the back straight and the feet placed flat on the floor, shoulder width apart, the \narms crossed at chest height, with an approximate angle of 90\u00ba flexion \nof the hip and knee. At a verbal signal, the participants stand up and \nthen return to the initial seated position. Participants were encouraged \nto repeat this as many times as possible within a 30 second period.\nAnthropometric assessment, body composition and basal \nmetabolic rate\nThe anthropometric assessment was made of the women, determi -\nning height, weight, waist circumference, using a digital scale, stadiome -\nter and tape measure, SECA brand, according to the instructions set out \nin resolution 2465 of the Ministry of Health of Colombia17. The data were \nused to calculate the BMI. Using the bioelectrical middle ear analyser, \nTanita brand (TBF-300WA Wrestling Body Composition Analyzer) the \nbody composition was determined, calculating the percentage of body \nfat and lean mass. The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) was calculated with \nthe Harris-Benedict formula, modified with the physical activity factor \n(+20%). BMR = [655.0955 + (9.5634 x weight in kg) + (1.8449 x height \nin cm) - (4.6756 x age in years)].  \nMonitoring and guiding nutritional behaviour\nOn the day of the initial assessment , the study subjects were given \na printed document and, prior to a detailed explanation by a nutritionist, \nthey recorded their nutritional behaviour during the 3 days prior to \nperforming the experimental protocol. This was for the purpose of com -\npensating for any improbable lipid profile results, derived from consuming \nexcessively high fat food. The aim was to redu ce alterations in the results \nobtained, derived from atypical dietary behaviour. \nOn the day of the experimental protocol, the food intake was moni -\ntored, standardising the calorie consumption prior to doing the exercises \nto 60% of the BMR with a physical activity factor for each case. The strategy \nincluded breakfast (cereals and fruit), snack (cereals) and lunch (chicken, potatoes and vegetables). All the food was prepared, proportioned and \nmonitored by a nutritionist. The aim of this procedure was to guarantee \nthat, when performing the exercise session, the lipid concentrations were \ninfluenced by similar nutritional conducts and in specific quantities for \neach individual case. The last food intake for each case was programmed \nat least 3 hours prior to the exercises, encouraging participants to keep \nhydrated just by drinking water.  \nBaseline lipid profile\nAll subjects underwent this procedure one day prior to doing the \nexercises and after at least a 12-hour fast. The women in the groups went \nto the facilities of the Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital Universitario Metropolitano \nin the morning, to have 5ml of blood drawn in order to determine the baseline lipid profile, which includes the analysis of the serum concen -\ntrations of Total Cholesterol (TC), HDL, LDL, VLDL and TG. \nExperimental protocol\nIn a maximum period of one week following the muscular fitness \nassessment, another appointment was scheduled with the study sub -\njects, at 5:00 pm at the gym facilities of the Physiotherapy Department \nof the Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital Universitario Metropolitano. On the  \nsubjects\u2019 arrival, the nutritionist initially authorised the exercise session for those women with no atypical eating disorders that could interfere \nwith the results and who correctly followed the dietary procedures, \nbased on the review of the nutrition monitoring document. \nBlood samples were drawn from the women by a bacteriological \nexpert, for the assessment of the lipid profile before the exercise session, and then immediately after it ended and 12 hours later, the following \nmorning (under fasting conditions). Immediately after being drawn, \nthe blood samples were taken to the laboratory for analysis. The exer -\ncise sessions for each experimental group and the control group are described below: \nExercise protocol \nThe subjects of the RE group did a 10 minute warm-up consisting \nin walking (5 min) and general joint mobilization (5 min). Following this, \nthey performed a total of 8 resistance exercises (1. Leg Press; 2. Machine \nknee extension; 3 Machine knee flexion; 4 Elbow flexion with dumb -\nbells; 5 Elbow extension with dumbbells; 6 Shoulder adduction with dumbbells from abduction in a supine position; 7. Unilateral dumbbell \nrow; and 8. Push-ups with free weight), each one with 3 sets and each \nset with 15 reps, with an intensity of 75% of MR1. The approximate total \nduration of this session was 40 minutes.\nThe CE group initially performed a 10 minute warm-up consisting \nin walking (5 min) and general joint mobilization (5 min), followed by \nthe same exercises as for the RE group, except for the fact that each exercise was only performed for a set with 15 reps, at 75% of MR1. \nSubsequently, the subjects performed 20 minutes of continuous pe -\ndalling on a cycle ergometer at a frequency of between 70 to 80% of \nthe maximum heart rate. The approximate total duration of this exercise session was 40 minutes.Roberto Rebolledo-Cobos, et al.82\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):79-85On the implicit instructions of the ethics and scientific committee of \nthe Universidad Metropolitana de Barranquilla, those subjects forming \npart of the Control Group (CG) ought to do some exercises to promote \ntheir physical health, from any point of view. It was therefore decided \nto get the members of this group to perform a set of passive stretching \nexercises, which were shown to have no metabolic implications on the \nlipid metabolism18. The session comprised a 10 minute warm-up (5 mi -\nnutes free walk and 5 minutes of joint mobilization) and 30 minutes of directed stretching. The average duration of this session was 40 minutes.\nAt the end of each exercise session, the subjects were instructed \nto drink only water with no calorie content, until the following morning \nwhen, under fasting conditions, a blood sample was taken correspon -\nding to 12 hours after the exercise session.\nStatistical analysis \nA descriptive and comparative statistical analysis was performed \nwith measurements of averages with respective standard deviations. \nThe Shapiro-Wilk test of normality was used and the Levene test of homogeneity. Subsequently, the Analysis of Variance Test (ANOVA) was used two-way, intra-group and inter-group. Whenever relevant, the Bonferroni post-hoc test was considered. The significance level was p <0.05, considering this for all analyses.\nResults\nThe results of the initial assessment of the women showed that \nthe randomisation did not lead to any significant difference between \nany of the groups and for none of the performance variables before \nexecuting the experimental protocol (Table 1). For the total number of women, the BMI ranged from 25.02 to 37.58, ranging from 25 to 30 in 23 \nwomen, greater than 30 for 8 women considered to have type I obesity \nand only one woman had a BMI of more than 35, considered to have \ntype II obesity. The distribution of women with obesity was balanced in \nthe three groups. The waist circumference value ranged between 84 to \n110 cm, with all the women with abdominal obesity coming within the \ncriteria established by resolution 2465 of 201617. The average values \nof the variables analysed in the initial evaluation of the women for the \ntotal population and for each of the experimental and control groups \nare set out in Table 1.\nThe statistical comparison of the average values between the expe -\nrimental groups, of the variables of the baseline lipid profile under fasting conditions and at each of the times established in the experimental \nprotocol (before, immediately after and 12 hours after exercise), showed \nno significant variations (p>0.05) in the exercise sessions performed by \nthe RE and CE groups in relation to total cholesterol, triglycerides and \nLDL. The assessment of the VLDL levels was statistically significant and \nwas lower for the women in the CE group 12 hours after the exercise \nsession, compared to the RE and CG groups. After 12 hours post-exercise, \nthe HDL levels were also seen to be statistically higher in the CE group in relation to the RE group (Table 2).\nTable 3 shows the within-group variations for each lipid profile \ncomponent, under fasting conditions, comparing the baseline analysis \nwith that collected 12 hours after the corresponding exercise session. \nNo statistical differences were found for any of the variables in the \ncomparison of averages in relation to times (p>0.05). The average with \nthe greatest variation in the CT analysis was that of the CG, dropping \n10.1%, followed by the RE group and CE with drops of 9.8% and 3.5% \nrespectively. The CE group showed a greater variation in the TG analy -\nTable 1.

For the  RE and CE groups, the LDL showed a tendency to \nincrease, while it dropped in the CG by 5.0%. Only the CE group showed \nlower VLDL plasma levels in the post-exercise period (22.3%), with the levels for this variable increasing in the RE group /7.0%) and CG (15.8%). \nThe HDL trend in the post-exercise analysis was to increase for all groups. \nDiscussion\nFor each individual, the lipid metabolism at the systemic level is \ndependent on many factors, including diet, the physical health condition \nand the daily energy expenditure. This study aimed to demonstrate \nthe influence of the different types of physical exercise considered, in a population of postmenopausal women with similar characteristics by \ncomparing the results of the assessment times (baseline, pre-exercise, \nimmediately post-exercise and 12 hours post-exercise) between the \nexperimental groups. In addition, it attempted to show the possible \ninfluence of physical exercise on the variation in the lipid profile under fasting conditions within each group. Although it is clear that the in -\nfluence of physical exercise is not the only determining factor in the lipid profile variations, given that, depending on time, the general energy shortage and the physiological replenishment mechanisms vary from subject to subject. However, it is extremely important to clarify that, \nalthough there are limitations with regard to the control of the biolo -\ngical and behavioural factors that influence the lipid profile, additional \nenergy expenditure involved in exercising, influences the magnitude of the physiological responses regulating the lipid metabolism and other energy substrates. \nThe analyses of the results of this study are based on the acute \nresponses of the types, levels and intensities of physical exercise con -\nsidered on the lipids found in the blood plasma. These responses have not been fully clarified for postmenopausal women, a population that \nis relatively prone to suffering CVD. The interpretation of responses at \ntimes that are subsequent to the scheduled performance of physical exercise is extremely important given that it makes it possible to build a useful description of the physiology of the human body, endeavouring to support the notion that argues the benefits of physical exercise not only when it is being performed but also subsequently, during a period of physiological recovery and reorganisation. \nFindings in the literature associate regular physical exercise with \nchanges in the metabolic and functional variables, primarily in com -\nbinations of resistance exercises with aerobic exercises\n9,19. In order to \nbring about changes in the BMI, weight and percentage of body fat, it is necessary to implement long-term exercise programs. This is a limiting factor in this study, given that a single exercise session does not produce changes in body composition. However, it has been observed that a \nsingle exercise session con modify the lipid profile of young people, \nadults and subjects with various disorders. \nThe systematic implementation of RE for more than 8 weeks, has \nshown findings associated with the reduction in serum concentrations of TC, TG and LDL, as well as increased concentrations of HDL\n20, although results from other studies differ, such as the study by Kelley et al.21, in \nwhich it is alleged that in different RE periods (for example, between 8 to 20 weeks) there are no changes in the lipoprotein concentrations \nin the blood plasma.\nWith regard to the acute effects of one exercise session, these effects \nare primarily associated with increased HDL concentrations. In a study \non healthy adult men, Wallace et al.\n22 reported a 12% increase in HDL \nplasma concentrations within the first 24 hours following a high volume \nand moderate intensity session of RE (7 exercises of 3 sets and 12 reps \nat 80% of the maximum strength), as well finding a 20% reduction in TG concentrations for the same period. Very similar results were found \nin this present study, a 13.6% increase in HDL was recorded for the RE \ngroup in relation to its baseline records, not finding any great changes \nin the TG levels 12 hours after exercise. \nCompared to the control group, the RE group subjects showed no \ndifferences in modifications of LDL and HDL, refuting the findings of the \nstudy made by Correa et al.\n23 in which high or low volume resistance \nexercises did not reduce the TC concentrations in postmenopausal \nwomen, neither did they affect the LDL and VLDL levels, both with re -\ngard to baseline values and the postprandial analysis. In the population studied, these results would associate resistance exercises with weak \nacute responses with regard to the lipid metabolism. However, more \nevidence is needed to support this claim, particularly taking account \nof the fact that the variability in the prescription of resistance exercises \nwith regard to volume, intensity, number of exercises, groups of mus -\ncles, recovery intervals and speed of contraction, may show divergent results for alternative combinations to those considered in this study. \nA marked trend in the lipid profile results before and immediately \nafter the exercise session was that none of the variables showed an intra-group statistical difference. However, 12 hours after exercise, the group \nthat combined aerobic and resistance exercises showed differences with \nthe RE group and control group, with a significant reduction in VLDL of \napproximately 22% in relation to the baseline records during fasting for \nthe same group. It appears that aerobic exercises have a better impact \non the energy metabolism of postmenopausal than just doing resistance \nexercises. For this population, Weise et al.\n5 reported that 12 hours after \nperforming a session of aerobic exercises, the TG concentrations could \nbe reduced by 8.5% while the HDL concentrations could be increased \nby 5%. In this study, the scope of the variation in TG and HDL within the \nCE group showed better results than in the aforementioned study, with \na 13% reduction in TG and an increase in HDL up to 16.7%, 12 hours \nafter performing the exercises. This finding may be an indicator that the \ncombination of aerobic and anaerobic exercises have a better impact on the acute lipid metabolism of postmenopausal women. \nThe above results may suggest that high levels of resistance exer -\ncises do not stimulate the formation of HDL, due to the fact that the \nreverse mobilisation of lipids (towards the liver) is reduced by the energy \ndemands of the exercised skeletal muscle, which requires the typical \nmobilisation of fatty acids. These are very similar results to those reported \nin the studies by Wooten et al.\n24 and Zotou  et al.25, where they d emons -\ntrated that, although resistance exercises exert a positive influence on Acute effects of resistance and concurrent exercise on the lipid profile of postmenopausal women85\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):79-85the acute mitigation of the baseline and postprandial lipid markers for \npostmenopausal women, the high volumes of these exercises did not show positive modifications in the HDL blood concentrations. \nThere are many authors who have not only mentioned a reduction \nin the levels of physical activity as a crucial factor in increasing the car -\ndiovascular risk in postmenopausal women, but also find physiological aggravating factors that can be controlled with periodical physical \nexercise, particularly in overweight women. According to the Ameri -\ncan College of Sports Medicine, the regular performance of resistance \nexercises may improve the overall physical health of women, and help prevent and treat cardiovascular risk related disorders, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Therefore, these exercises, monitored by a spe -\ncialist, are currently part of rehabilitation and physical fitness programs, \ndirected at this population\n26. There is little evidence-based literature that \ndescribes the acute metabolic implications of concurrent exercises on \nthe lipid profile of postmenopausal women, although studies such as Figueroa et al.\n19 and Libardi et al.27 show positive effects on the control \nof cardiovascular risk factors when this type of exercise is performed in \nthe long term. Based on the most important findings of this study, it is \npossible to start to consider the idea of the combined performance of \nresistance and aerobic exercises, in order to guarantee positive acute \ninfluences on the blood lipid profile of postmenopausal women, which, \nin the long term, could become a protective factor against suffering CVD.\nBased on the analysis of the results of this study, we can conclude \nthat, in comparison to the performance of a session of resistance exer -\ncises, a session of concurrent exercises could positively affect the lipid \nprofile of overweight postmenopausal women, principally 12 hours \nafter doing the exercises, reducing the VLDL plasma concentrations \nand increasing the HDL concentration.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors do not declare a conflict of interest.\nBibliography \n 1.

Sodio.Summary\nHigher sweat rate values have been reported during intermittent compared to continuous type exercise in hot conditions in \nthe laboratory. Studies in the training field are scarce. \nObjective: Document sweat rate, rehydration and core temperature (Tc) during training in long duration-continuous (CON) \nand intermittent (INT) type sports, and determine the presence of a mutation in the CFTR gene in athletes with high sodium \nconcentration ([Na+]) in sweat.\nMethods: Athletes (CON =50 and INT=123) were tested during training in tropical climate. Sweat rate, sweat [Na+], Tc, de-\nhydration level, and presence of \u2206 F508 gene mutation in the CFTR gene in athletes with high sweat [Na+] were evaluated. \nResults: Sweat rate was higher in CON (1.5 \u00b1 0.4 L/h) compared to INT (1.2 \u00b1 0.5 L/h) and CON athletes finished training with \nhigher dehydration (2.1 \u00b1 0.8 vs 1.2 \u00b1 0.7%) P < 0.05. Sweat [Na+] was higher in INT (62.0 \u00b1 21.1 mmol/L) compared to CON \n(53.9 \u00b1 18.1 mmol/L), P < 0.05. A tennis player with high [Na+] was heterozygous for the \u0394F508 mutation. Average and highest \nTc was similar for CON (38.4 \u00b1 0.3 and 38.8 \u00b1 0.4 oC) and INT (38.3 \u00b1 0.3 and 38.7 \u00b1 0.4 oC), P > 0.05. \nConclusion: During training in a tropical climate, sweat loss and dehydration level are lower, and fluid intake is higher in \nintermittent compared to continuous type sports. Core temperature may rise to a similar level in intermittent type sports due \nto the repeated high intensity bouts and/or the effects of clothing worn while training in hot venues. Healthy athletes with \nhigh [Na+] in sweat who are heterozygous carriers of CFTR mutations may be at increased risk for hyponatremic dehydration \nand whole-body muscle cramps.Key words:  \nSweating.

The risk is higher if athletes begin training in a state of body \nfluid deficit and do not drink enough during exercise to replenish losses\n2. Sweat losses of 1 to 2 L/h are common during training and \ncompetition in hot and humid tropical environments and may reach or exceed 2.5 L/h in heavy sweaters. Heat acclimatized elite athletes with \nhigh sweat production that train for long duration-continuous type (CON) sports, are most prone to dehydration. Athletes in intermittent \ntype (INT) sports, such as team, ball and combat sports, are also at risk \nsince multiple high intensity time periods elevate metabolic heat pro -\nduction and core temperature and induce heavy sweating\n3. This may \nbe particularly true in athletes who wear heat-retaining clothing and/\nor protective equipment that decreases the effectiveness of heat loss through the evaporation of sweat. \nAthletes with high sweat rates are more susceptible to large electro -\nlyte losses in sweat, which have been implicated in the development of \nskeletal muscle cramps\n4. Athletes born and raised in the tropics may be \nprotected from large sodium losses because regular exposure to high \nenvironmental temperatures induces physiological adaptations in the \nsweat glands such as an increased sodium reabsorption which result in a decreased sweat sodium concentration ([Na\n+]) for a given sweat rate5,6. \nHowever, a proportion of athletes exhibit \u201csalty sweat\u201d . Those whose \nsweat [Na+] is typically higher than 55 mmol/L4,7 may have a reduced \nCl- and Na+ reabsorption across the sweat duct membrane. \nStudies have identified persons without cystic fibrosis (CF) have \nsweat Na+ levels like those of CF patients8. It is possible that some \nhealthy \u201csalty sweaters,\u201d are heterozygous for a CF mutation and have \na malfunction of plasma membrane CF transmembrane conductance \nregulator (CFTR) in the sweat glands that results in sweat with high \nsodium chloride concentration like CF patients9. Approximately 1 in 46 \nHispanics carry one mutation of the CFTR gene that causes hypo-absorp -\ntion of Na+ in sweat gland ducts and high sweat [Na+]10. In the United \nStates, the most common mutation in the CFTR gene associated to the development of CF is the deletion of phenylalanine 508 (\u0394F508)\n11 and \nits prevalence in athletes with salty sweat is currently unknown.   \nStudies in the laboratory have shown that prolonged variable \nintensity exercise with periods of high intensity exercise (\u226515 minutes) \nmay elicit similar or higher heat storage, core temperature (Tc), and sweat \nproduction, as prolonged constant intensity exercise with no rest peri-ods\n3,12-14,. Studies in the playing field show a predisposition to heat strain \ndue to hyperthermia and dehydration in American Football players15 but \nvery little is known about other intermittent type or endurance sports in tropical environments. Particularly lacking are data in female athletes . \nThe aims of the present observational field study were to: 1) docu -\nment the sweating response and rehydration during training sessions \nin tropical climate in CON and INT sports in both genders; 2) investigate \nthe presence of the \u2206F508 mutation in the CFTR gene in athletes with \nhigh sweat [Na\n+]; and 3) compare the Tc response in a subset of male and \nfemale athletes in CON and INT sports. We hypothesized that athletes in INT sports would show a lower sweat rate, a lower average Tc and a \nhigher sweat [Na+].\nMaterial and method\nSubjects\nOne hundred and seventy three competitive athletes participat -\ning in long duration-continuous (endurance=50; 30 males [M] and 20 \nfemales [F]) or intermittent (ball/team= 94, 45 M and 49 F; combat =29, \n15 M and 14 F) sports (Table 1) were tested during a typical training session for their sport. The subjects were recruited from teams in a \nCentral American and Caribbean competition in the summer in Puerto \nRico and from National teams, top ranked university teams, and recrea -\ntional athletes ranked in the top of their age categories in Puerto Rico. \nAll were natives of tropical countries with a predominantly warm and \nhumid climate all year long. \nAll subjects were informed of the purpose and procedures of the \nstudy and written informed consent was obtained. There were 52 ath -\nletes between the ages of 17 and 21 who gave their written assent, and written consent was also obtained from their parents. The study was \napproved by the Institutional Review Board of  the University of Puerto \nRico, Medical Sciences Campus. \nStudy design and procedures\nAthletes were studied under environmental conditions typical of \ntraining sessions for their sport, and wearing uniforms and equipment \nused in competition. This field study design allowed us to collect in-\nformation in conditions that are difficult to simulate in the laboratory. Athletes completed a questionnaire about heat exposure during exer -\ncise and past history of muscle cramps. General health status was also documented to assure they did not have a medical condition that would affect thermoregulatory or body fluid balance variables. \nAll subjects were tested during the summer months in Puerto Rico. \nThe average WBGT (10 am to 4 pm) was 29.9 \u00b1 1.6 \noC16. The runners, \ncyclists, triathletes, soccer, tennis, and beach volleyball players trained \noutdoors exposed to direct sunlight, while the judo, basketball, team \nTable 1.

All athletes wore official \ncompetition uniforms required for their sport. The judokas and fencers \nwore t -shirts and shorts underneath the uniforms. \n \u2212Pre-training session. Subjects urinated into a pre-weighed contain -\ner. Nude body weight was determined using an electronic scale \naccurate to 50 g (precision health scale uc321). After cleaning the \narea with distilled water, absorbent patches (Tegaderm +pad, \n3m Health Care, Borken, Germany) were applied to the subject\u2019s \nright posterior forearm and right anterior thigh for regional sweat \ncollection in all but the beach volleyball players, in which it was \napplied to the right anterior thigh only. Athletes were then fitted \nwith an accelerometer (Actigraph GTX3; Actigraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) that was programmed to record activity counts in one-minute epochs. The cyclists wore the accelerometer on the right thigh.\n \u2212Training session. The duration of training was similar to a typical \nsession for the sport. Training sessions were organized and directed \nby the athletes\u2019 coaches. Environmental conditions were measured \nbefore, every 30 min, and at the end of training, using a heat stress \nmonitor (Questemp 32, Quest Technologies, Wisconsin), which was placed in the training area. Athletes drank voluntarily from labeled bottles with water and/or sports drinks. Any subject who needed \nto urinate during the training session did so into a pre-weighed \ncontainer and the volume was measured. The absorbent patches were removed when saturated and placed in sealed plastic tubes.\n \u2212Post-training session. Athletes removed the accelerometer and \nclothes, towel dried and pre-training measures were repeated (urine sample, nude body weight). \n \u2212Measures and calculations\n \u2212Hydration status. Urine specific gravity (USG) was used as an index of \npre-exercise hydration status17 and determined using a hand-held \nrefractometer (URC-NE, Atago Clinical, Japan). \n \u2212Environmental conditions.  Dry bulb (DB), wet bulb (WB), globe \ntemperature (GT), and relative humidity (RH) were measured on site. The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) heat stress index was \ncalculated using the following equations: CON sports: (WB x 0.7) + \n(GT x 0.2) + (DB x 0.1); INT sports: (WB x 0.7) + (GT x 0.3)\n18.\n \u2212Regional  sweat [Na+]. Sweat was extracted from each patch using \na 5-ml syringe and two 100 \u00b5l samples were analyzed using an ion selective electrolyte analyzer (Easylyte Plus, Medica, Bedford, MA) \nto determine the [Na+]. \n \u2212Body fluid balance.  The bottles with the fluid that was used for hydra -\ntion during the session were weighed before and after the session \nwith a scale accurate to 1 g (CS2000 Compact Scale). Sweat loss \nwas calculated as: change in body mass, corrected for fluid intake \nand urine loss. Sweat rate was calculated as sweat loss divided \nby exercise duration. The level of dehydration was determined \nusing the following formula: (body mass pre-training \u2013 body mass \npost-training) / body mass pre-training.\n \u2212Core temperature. Core temperature was measured in 62 athletes \nthat lived and trained in Puerto Rico (females, CON= 10 and INT=34; \nmales, CON=13 and INT=5) using ingestible sensors (Cortemp\u2122, \nHQ Inc.) before, every 10 minutes, and at the end of training. We \nmeasured Tc only in athletes who could satisfy requirements for valid measurements (sensor calibration, timing of ingestion and \nelectromagnetic interference). Eight hours prior to the beginning \nof the exercise session, each subject swallowed a disposable pill \nthat contained a temperature sensor for Tc determination. Pre-ex -\nercise Tc was the value taken after sitting quietly for five minutes in \nthe exercise area before the start of training. The Tc of the exercise \nsession was the average of measures taken every 10 minutes. The change in T\nc was calculated as the highest minus the pre-exercise \nTc. A final measure was taken immediately after the coach indicated \nthe session had finished.\nGenetic analysis\nAthletes with a sweat [Na+] \u2265 70 mmol/l were identified for subse -\nquent genetic analysis19. Athletes were asked to provide two ml of saliva \nwhich were collected into a DNA genotek\u2019s oragene\u00ae DNA self-collec -\ntion vial. The container had approximately 2 ml of cell lysis solution or \nDNA-preserving fluid, that was mixed with the saliva. Genomic DNA was assayed for the \u2206 F508 mutation in the CFTR gene, using restriction \nfragment length polymorphism (Ambry Genetics, Aliso Viejo, CA). As \nper standard procudedures, DNA was extracted from saliva and puri -\nfied. The purified DNA was digested using restriction endonucleases. \nThe restriction fragments produced during DNA fragmentation were \nanalyzed using gel electrophoresis. \n \nStatistical Analysis\nMeans and standard deviations were calculated for each variable. \nStudent\u2019s t-tests were used to compare CON and INT in pre-exercise \nurine specific gravity, sweat rate, percent dehydration, percent rehy-\ndration, minutes of exposure to exercise in the heat in the past month, \nactivity counts/min, sweat [Na+], pre, average, change and highest \nTc, and the WBGT index. An alpha level of P < 0.05 was considered \nsignificant.\nResults\nSubjects, environmental conditions and training \nsessions\nDescriptive characteristics of the subjects and training session \ncharacteristics are presented in Table 2. The WBGT index for CON and \nINT was > 28 oC, which is typical of tropical countries during the summer \nand indicates that all subjects were exposed to a high level of heat stress without exhibiting symptoms of heat illness. Activity counts per minute\n20 \nrevealed that in INT sports the training sessions were of predominantly light- to- moderate intensity whereas in CON sports they were shorter and of vigorous intensity. The average time spent training exposed to solar radiation in the month preceding the study was 17% high er in CON.\nHydration status and fluid balance\nAthletes in INT arrived to the training session in a state of hypo -\nhydration as evidenced by a mean pre-exercise USG of 1.021 \u00b1 0.006. \nAthletes in CON had a higher sweat rate ( P< 0.05) and finished training \nwith higher ( P < 0.05) level of dehydration (2.1 \u00b1 0.8 vs 1.2 \u00b10.7%) due Sweating and core temperature in athletes training in continuous and intermittent sports in tropical climate89\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):86-91\nto lower fluid replacement. Sweat [Na+] was higher (P < 0.05) in INT \ncompared to CON and there was no difference between genders and \nhistory of muscle cramps. \nSixty athletes (28% of the group) had a sweat [Na+] >70 mmol/L \nand sweat [Cl-] > 60 mmol/l. Forty-nine of those (82%) provided saliva \nsamples for genetic analysis. One male tennis player was identified as \nhaving heterozygous presence of the \u0394F508 mutation in the CFTR gene. \nHe had a history of whole body muscle cramps and his sweat [Na+] was \n74.9 mmol/L (average of thigh and forearm regional sweat samples).\nCore temperature \nWe measured core temperature in 23 athletes in CON (females=10; \nmales=5) and in 39 athletes in INT (females=34; males=5). For this sub-\ngroup, the CON sports were running, cycling, and triathlon and the INT \nsports were soccer, basketball, handball, and judo. For the whole group, the average and highest T\nc for the session was similar for CON (38.4 \u00b1 \n0.3 and 38.8 \u00b1 0.4 oC) and INT (38.3 \u00b1 0.3 and 38.7 \u00b1 0.4 oC), P < 0.05. \nIn Figure 1 we present the Tc before, during and at the end of the \nINT training sessions.

The main findings \nwere: 1) sweat rate and the change in core temperature were higher in CON compared to INT; 2) low fluid intake resulted in a higher level \nof dehydration in CON; 3) a proportion of athletes exhibit \u201csalty sweat\u201d \nand one was a healthy carrier of a CFTR gene mutation; and 4) athletes in INT exhibited maximal T\nc similar to athletes in CON who trained at \nhigh intensity for longer periods.\nHydration status and fluid balance\nAthletes in our study are indigenous to the tropics and have \nphysiological adaptations induced by repeated exposure to a hot and \nhumid environment that lead to increased capacity and sensitivity of the sweat glands\n21. The sweat rate values in males (1.6 \u00b1 0.4 L/h) and \nfemales (1.3 \u00b1 0.3 L/h) in CON and in males in INT (1.5 \u00b1 0.4 L/h) in the \npresent study are higher than normative data reported for adult male (1.42 \u00b1 0.72 L/h) and female (1.10 \u00b1 0.57 L/h) athletes\n22.\nWhole body sweat rate comparisons between continuous and \nintermittent type exercise in the heat in controlled, artificial, thermoneu -\ntral13,23, and hot-dry3 conditions have revealed mixed results. Drust et al13 \nfound a similar sweat rate during a laboratory-based soccer protocol in male athletes that ran on a treadmill for 45 minutes either intermittently (7.5 min exercise/1.2 min rest) or continuously in a thermoneutral en -\nvironment. In contrast, Mora-Rodriguez et al.\n3 found higher sweat rate \nduring 90 min of variable intensity intermittent exercise (1.5 min high intensity/4.5 min low intensity) compared to same amount of work performed at a constant load in endurance-trained, heat-acclimated males exercising in hot-dry environment. In the present field study, in which we did not control for exercise intensity or environmental con -\nditions, we found higher sweat rates in athletes in CON which may be expected for two reasons: 1) a greater proportion of the CON sessions were at high exercise intensity; and 2) athletes in CON were exposed to a higher heat stress. \nOur data are consistent with the observation that athletes replace \nless than 50% of their sweat losses during exercise and thus, they are hypohydrated at the end of training\n24. In CON sports opportunities to \ndrink may be frequent but athletes may be reluctant to drink, to avoid slowing down and the abdominal discomfort associated with large fluid consumption. On the other hand, in intermittent type sports, regular opportunities for hydration are available during substitutions, pauses in play, time-outs, intermissions, and change of sides of court, which leads to frequent and better fluid replacement. \nSweat sodium and genetic mutation in CFTR gene\nWhen the sweat rate is high, sodium reabsorption capacity in the \nsweat gland can be exceeded resulting in a higher [Na+] appearing in sweat. However, the linear increase seen in sweat [Na+] as sweat rate \nincreases can be modulated by heat acclimation5. For example, Buono  et \nal.5 showed that heat acclimation may increase the absorptive capacity \nof the sweat gland duct, reducing the sweat [Na+] for a given sweat rate \nup to 1 mg. cm-2. min-1. In the present study athletes in CON showed a \nlower sweat [Na+] despite their higher sweat rate in comparison to ath -\nletes INT, which may be attributed to their higher level of heat exposure \nand acclimatization. An advantage of a higher sweat rate coupled with a lower sweat [Na\n+] for athletes in CON is a lower risk for developing \nhyponatremia during exercise in the heat25. \nA factor proposed for high Na+ excretion in healthy athletes is the \npresence of genetic mutations in the CFTR that affects the Cl- channel \nin the sweat glands7,8. The majority of CF patients have the \u2206F508 muta -\ntion and exhibit [Na+] in their sweat that may be up to five times higher \nthan healthy individuals26. It is estimated that 2% (1 in 46) of Hispanic \nAmericans are heterozygous carriers of a mutated CFTR gene10 and may \nbe genetically predisposed to high sweat Na+ loss. The prevalence of CF \nmutations in athletes with salty sweat is currently unknown.\nA reduced ductal luminal membrane expression of the Cl- channel \nwas found in six healthy recreationally active subjects with a mean sweat \n[Na+] of 94.9 \u00b1 15.2 mmol/l7. However, in that study, none of the subjects \nwas a carrier of any of the 39 most common CFTR mutations in the United States. The authors concluded that a full CFTR gene sequencing of the subjects would be required before excluding a possible genetic link between excessive Na\n+ loss in sweat and CFTR mutations. \nA novel finding of our study was that one of 45 Hispanic athletes \n(2%), classified as \u201csalty sweaters\u201d was heterozygous for the \u2206F508 mu -\ntation in the CFTR gene. That athlete was a tennis player with a history of whole body muscle cramps that lead to collapse on court requiring \nmedical attention. \nCore temperature response\nDuring prolonged high intensity exercise, the heat stored is higher \nand Tc rises faster when the same amount of exercise is performed in \na variable intensity mode that includes short (1.5 to 7.5 min) high in -\ntensity bouts followed by rest periods compared to constant intensity mode\n3,13,23,27. However, if longer bouts (15-30 min) of high intensity ex -\nercise are used, a similar Tc rise is observed28,29. We found that although \nathletes in INT spent the majority of the exercise session at lower exercise intensity with multiple resting periods, they exhibited a maximal T\nc \n(38.7 \u00b1 0.4 oC) similar to athletes in CON (38.8 \u00b1 0.4 oC) who trained at \nhigh exercise intensity for most of the session. This response suggests that the heat stored during the few periods of high exertion was not \ndissipated significantly and T\nc remained elevated instead of decreasing \nas expected during low intensity exercise periods.\nThe highest core temperature response in INT was observed in \njudokas who trained in a non-air-conditioned gym (WBGT= 30.0 oC). \nSimilar to our previous report30, judokas in the present study arrived to \ntraining with a fluid deficit, as evidenced by USG. The combination of \na pre-exercise fluid deficit that worsened during training because of \ninadequate fluid Intake, hot and humid environmental conditions, and \ninsulation properties of the uniform that decreased heat dissipation, \npredisposed the athletes to hyperthermia during training. In fact, 8 of the 9 judokas felt overheated and 7 of them had maximal T\nc \u2265 39.0 oC. Sweating and core temperature in athletes training in continuous and intermittent sports in tropical climate91\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):86-91Two athletes reached a Tc of 39.6 oC and felt dizzy, had a headache, and \nstopped training with symptoms of exhaustion. High Tc and increased \nphysiologic strain have been reported in American football athletes \nwearing a full uniform while training in similar climatic conditions15. \nWe believe this to be the first study documenting the rate of Tc rise in \njudo athletes during training in the heat. Our data indicate that training in full uniform in a non-air conditioned gym in the tropics predisposes \njudo athletes to heat illness and should be discouraged.  \nConclusions\nThis observational field study demonstrates that during training in \na tropical climate, sweat loss and dehydration level are lower, and fluid intake is higher in intermittent compared to continuous type sports. \nNonetheless, core temperature may rise to a similar level in intermittent type sports due to the repeated high intensity bouts and/or the effects \nof clothing worn while training in hot venues. For athletes in continuous sports, high sweat rates may not provide a thermoregulatory advantage \nin a tropical climate because humidity hinders the evaporation of sweat. \nCoaches should pay special attention to factors that may increase fluid \nintake, such as availability of cool, palatable fluids, encouragement to drink, and frequent, short pauses. Healthy athletes with high [Na\n+] \nin sweat who are heterozygous carriers CFTR mutations may be at \nincreased risk for hyponatremic dehydration and whole-body muscle \ncramps during exercise.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank the athletes and their coaches for their enthusi -\nastic participation in the study, research assistants Jos\u00e9 Qui\u00f1ones, Javier \nR\u00edos, Eddie Rodr\u00edguez, and David Col\u00f3n, and medical personnel at the \nCenter for Sports Health and Exercise Sciences for their help during \ntesting.  \nConflict of interest\nThe authors do not declare a conflict of interest.\nBibliography\n 1 .

This study aimed to investigate the effects of tapering and Nigella sativa \n(NS) hydro-alcoholic extract on the reduction of lung tissue inflammation caused due to increasing interval exercise training \n(IIET) during maturation period by histological and stereological methods. \nMethods: Nighty-five three weeks old rats after adaption were randomly divided into two control and exercise groups and 19 \nsubgroups. The exercise group carried out a period of six weeks of undulating IIET followed by three weeks of load reduction \nperformed by three models in two different times. Rats entered the taper phase were administrated by NS supplement in \ntapering and control groups. The lung tissue samples were processed by standard paraffin embedding, stained by H&E and \nexamined by using point counting method through systematic random sampling in stereological study. The results were \nanalyzed using by two-way ANOVA and LSD post hoc in \u03b1=0.05.\nResults: The result showed that IIET caused severe inflammation in lung tissue and an increase in infiltration of inflammatory \ncells and lymphocytes into the connective tissues surrounding the respiratory air ways, vessels and interstitial lamellae. This \nseverity of inflammation was considerably and similarly more in comparison to the basic and control groups ( p=0.001). Ste -\nreological analysis in the taper exercise training groups with NS and without NS as well, reveled a significant decrease in the \ndegree and intensity of lung tissue inflammation in the examined times in comparison to the IIET group ( p=0.001).\nConclusion: Generally it can be concluded that performing NS and a three weeks period of tapering has a noticeable effect \nin the reduction of inflammation in lung tissue followed by interval exercise training.Key words:  \nIncreasing interval exercise \ntraining.

Increase in the volume and intensity \nof the exercise training along with a decrease in the recovery time may \ncause an overtraining in athletes and affect their immune system3. \nOn the other hand, physical exercise can be a strong stimulus in the \ndevelopment of lung inflammation4. Findings of several studies shows \nthat exercise training load beyond the normal range increases the risk \nof upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)2,5 while moderate exercise not \nonly decrease these risks but also reinforce the function of respiratory \nimmune system1,6. Researches showed that the URTI symptoms in the \nmost of the elite athletes are similar to general population6, however, \nusual seasonal patterns of URTI are not seen in these athletes7. It is found \nout that short and long term physical exercise trainings with different \ngrades and intensities affect the immunity and inflammatory factors \nin childhood and adulthood period8. There are still many unanswered \nquestions on physical exercise mechanisms influencing inflammatory \nindex before and during puberty9.\nSince mild inflammation in early stages is a helpful protective \nresponse against primary cellular damage factors which eliminates \nexternal invaders and necrotic tissue and also because too much \ninflammation causing severe damage to lung tissue can be life-threat -\nening10, it seems necessary to take some strategies in exercise training \nprograms including taper to prevent overtraining and immune function \ndecline11,12. Taper can be performed in the forms of frequency reduction, \nrepetition and intensity of exercise training3,13 in different time periods. \nOne of the hardest challenges for sport science researchers and trainers \nis considered as to determine the most appropriate taper program14. \nLimited studies about intensity of exercise training during taper period \nshowed athletes can make use of training intensity reduction programs \nin order to improve their performance in competition season15. Some \nreports reveled that time execution of swimmers16, runners17 and bike \nriders18 improved due to taper programs. Previous studies suggest the \nfavorable time period for taper is between 4 to 28 days or even more8,13. \nThough many studies have confirmed a two-week period taper, there \nhave been some reports on the improvement of athletes' performance \ndue to very short or very long period tapers19. Thomas et al.3 concluded \nthat the optimal time duration for taper depends on the training before \nthe taper and no particular time limit can be specified for that.\nToday, there are several methods other than taper such as me -\ndicinal plants using for reducing the symptoms of inflammation and \nboosting the immune system. Among these plants,  Nigella sativa L . (NS) \nis a medicinal plant known in Iranian traditional medicine. This native \nplant has been used for the treatment of headaches, nasal congestion, \nasthma, and allergy as well as for boosting the immune system20,21. The \nbiological properties of the seed of this plant include Anti-oxidative, \nanti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-viral and anti-microbial effects as well \nas strengthening the immune system22. Previous studies indicated that \nNS has a protective effect in lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis23,24. Gho -\nlamzadeh et al.25 revealed that NS has an anti-inflammatory effect and \nreduces pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio in overtrained animals. \nThey showed that this effect of NS is more pronounce d in overtraining \nanimals than control or moderate exercise animals. In fact, NS causes an immunoregulatory effect which somehow homogenizes immune \nstate during different physiological status25. \nSince in the previous studies, the compatibilities of the high \nintensity trainings, the effects of taper and NS use during maturation \nperiod as to the inflammatory response of the lung did not come to a \nclear conclusion, this study was designed to investigate the effect of \nthe performing different patterns of taper following a high-intensity \ninterval training (HIIT) as well as influence of interactive effect of taper \nand NS on the microscopic properties of inflammation in lung tissue of \nmale Wistar rats during maturation period.\nMaterial and method\nAnimals\nIn this study, 95 male Wistar rats with an approximate age of 3 weeks \nand an average weight of 68\u00b19 g were obtained from Pasteur Institute \nof Iran. In order to adaptation, animals (5 rats per cage) were maintained \nin transparent polycarbonate cages under controlled environment with \na temperature of 23\u00b12 \u00baC, humidity of 45-55 % and 12:12 hours light/\ndark cycle for two week. Throughout all stages of the study, ethics of \nworking with laboratory animals such as free access to standard pellet \ndiet and water ad libitum , euthanizing without pain, prevention of pain \nassociated with surgery and sampling were taken into consideration \naccording to the international recommendations about clinical and \nlaboratory animals\u2019 researches, ratified in Helsinki and updated in 2008 by \nthe American Physiology. After one weeks of familiarity with laboratory \nand manipulation, the rats were randomly divided into two control and \nexercise groups matched for their weight.\nExercise training program\nThe rats were divided into two control and exercise groups at first. \nThen, for getting acquainted with the treadmill, they performed the \nexercise training with the main pattern training including increasing \ninterval training (IIT) but with a lower intensity for two weeks. After \none week period of getting acquainted with the environment and \nthe treadmill, they performed increasing interval undulating exercise \ntraining for six weeks and that was followed by 3 weeks of load reduc -\ntion (taper) carried out by 3 models in two different times. Treatment \nand un-treatment with NS supplement was also observed during the \ntapering (Table 1). Finally, according to research design and sampling \nprocedure after 6 weeks increasing interval exercise training, the first \nand third week of tapering, the animals were divided into 19 groups \nand each group included 5 rats.\nThe familiarity and compatibility phase included 4 sessions of in -\nterval exercise training per week with the speed of 10 to 25 meters per \nminute and the slope of zero percent lasting for 15 to 30 minutes. The \nincreasing interval exercise training program was carried out in the form \nof 10 repetitions of 1 minute length and active rests of 2 minute length \nminutes in such a way that the total daily workout time for each rat was \n30 minutes-long. The animals started the increasing interval exercise \ntraining at the speed of 25 m/min and ended it at the speed of 70 m/\nmin26. Apart from the main activity, 5 minutes was estimated for warm -Shadmehr Mirdar, et al.94\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):92-99ing up and 5 minutes for cooling down. This program was conducted \nin 6 weeks and each week included 6 sessions (Table 2). Following the \nincreasing interval exercise trainings, the rats entered the taper phase \nin which NS supplement was used for the taper and control groups27. \nPreparation of hydro-alcoholic extract\nFifty five grams of NS powder was weighed with a scale of 0.001 \nprecision and then was soaked in 30% distilled water mixed with 70% \nethanol solution for 72 hours. During this period, the container of the \nsolution was well sealed with paraffin and was kept at 20 to 25 \u00baC room \ntemperature. The mixture was stirred with a glassy rod every six hours. \nAfter this period, the mixture was filtered through Whatman filter paper \nand its solvent was removed by mild temperature rotary (under 60 \u00b0C). \nControl and NS tapering groups was treated by extract via oral gavage \nat a dose of 500 mg/kg body weight.\nTissue sampling and histological studies\nAt the end of six week period of increasing interval exercise training, \nand at the end of the first and the third week of tapering (Table 3), the anim als were euthanized with a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride \n(50 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), intraperitoneally and left lung was \nremoved and fixed in a 10% buffered formalin solution. Lung tissue \nsamples were dehydrated by passing through a graded series of ethanol \nand cleared by xylene and impregnated by paraffin. Tissue processing \nwas done by histokinette 2000 (Lica, Germany) and samples were em -\nbedded in paraffin blocks. Then, 20 to 25 non-serial 5 \u03bcm sections from \neach block were obtained using rotary microtome and stained with \nhematoxylin-eosin (H&E). For quantitative and qualitative microscopic \nanalysis of lung tissue, at least 10 microscopic fields from each section \nwere examined at \u00d7 400 magnification using point counting and based \non systematic uniform random strategy and unbiased stereological stud -\nies by a version 9 stereo-investigator system software (MBF Bioscience, \nMicro Bright Field, Inc., Germany). In each microscopic field, 0.016 mm2 \nof lung tissue were analyzed. Inflammation index of lung tissue was \nevaluated using grading scale described by Braber et al.28 based on the \nfrequency and manner of the inflammatory cell presence. A value of 0 \nwas assigned when no inflammation was detectable, a value of 1 was \nadjudged for occ asional cuffing with inflammatory cells, a value of 2 \nwhen most bronchi or vessels were surrounded by a thin layer (one to Table 1.

Total lung inflammation was defined as \nthe average of the peribronchial and perivascular inflammation scores28. \nAll analyses were carried out by one evaluator who was blinded to the \ntreatment groups.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software \nversion 21. For the analysis of normal distribution of data, Kolmog -\norov-Smirnov test and for the comparison of the variables among \ngroups, a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by LSD post hoc test were used. Descriptive statistical data expressed as mean \u00b1 SD; \ndifferences of p\u22640.05 was considered as significant and the rejection \nof null hypothesis. \nResults\nThe study of histological structure of lung tissue has revealed that \nthe lung parenchyma was normal in both control and basic groups (Figure 1-A and B). Structural integrity of lung tissue in taper groups \ntreated by NS was greater and better than in the taper groups without \nNS. Furthermore, among the groups with NS, the third week taper groups had a better structure and a more integrated alveolus wall. The results of microscopic investigations showed that IIT had a significant effect on \nthe lung tissue of rats during maturation period. These results indicated \nthat the IIT caused severe inflammation in lung tissue and infiltration of inflammatory cells and lymphocytes into the connective tissue around \nthe respiratory airway, vessels and interstitial lamellae (Figure 1-C). The \ntaper exercises could decrease these damages in the lung tissue (Figure 1-D to 1-F). Although a small amount of emphysema, and mild interstitial \ninflammation was observed in some taper groups , this damage was\nless in the groups with NS, but the relative inhibitory effect of all threetaper types were rather good (Figure 1-G to 1-I). Among these groups, \nthe taper group treated with NS  in the third week showed a better\nimprovement in comparison to the other groups. \nAs it is shown in Figure 2, results indicated that the severity of lung \ntissue inflammation in control groups increased until the second week \nof tapering (age of 13 weeks) and then decreased. The severity of lung tissue inflammation in control groups without NS increased as similarly \nand significantly as in the basic and interval control groups (age of 11 weeks), ( p=0.002). A similar and significant increase of inflammation \nhas also been observed in the second week control animals with NS \ncomparing with the basic and interval control groups ( p=0.02). There was \nnot a significant difference in the severity of lung tissue inflammation in the second week taper groups (age of 14 weeks) with and without \nNS comparing with the basic group (respectively p= 0.07 and p=0.30).\nFigure 3 indicates that the implementation of the 6- week undulat -\ning and IIT (Table 2) during maturation period caused the most severe inflammation in lung tissue (grade 3) and the occurrence of this inflam-\nmation was similarly and significantly more frequent in comparison to the control and basic groups.\nThe results showed that the implementation of the three kinds of \ntaper exercise training programs (frequency, repetition, intensity) fol -\nlowing the IIT, could significantly decrease the amount and severity of \nlung tissue inflammation (p=0.001) in the studied times in comparison \nto interval training (Figure 4). After two weeks of frequency, repetition and intensity tapering, the degree of lung inflammation decreased 32, \n49 and 52 percent respectively compared to the interval training and \nthis decrease continued until the third week of the tapering (51, 52 and \n Figure 1.

This reduction \nwas significant only in frequency taper ( p=0.001, p=0.60 and p=0.195 \nrespectively in frequency, repetition, and intensity groups).\nThe evaluation of interactive effect of NS hydro-alcoholic extract use \n(as a supplement) and the implementation of different patterns of taper \nrevealed the same amount of decrease in lung tissue inflammation as the groups without NS (Figure 5). The frequency, repetition and intensity \ngroups, with a decrease of respectively 61%, 75% and 72% in the second week and a decrease of 77%, 82% and 80% in the third week, showed a similar and significant decrease in lung tissue inflammation comparing \nwith interval exercise training group ( p=0.001). In the survey of the time \neffect, a decrease of 43%, 28% and 30% in lung tissue inflammation was \nobserved in the third week frequency, repetition and intensity taper \ngroups compared to the second week taper groups. This change was \nsignificant only in frequency taper group ( p=0.002, p=0.195, p=0.120 \nrespectively in frequency, repetition, intensity groups).\nThe results of the present study showed that the degree of lung tis -\nsue inflammation in all taper groups was significantly higher comparing to their counterpart ( p=0.04) and basic ( p=0.001) groups. As it is shown \nin Figure 6, the use of hydro-alcoholic extract of NS in the taper groups \ncould decrease the amount of lung tissue inflammation caused by interval exercise. Lung tissue inflammation in the frequency, repetition \nand intensity groups treated with NS in the second week decreased Figure 3.

In short, it can be concluded that the increasing interval exercise \nalong with the implementation of intensity and repetition tapers and \nusing the hydro-alcoholic extract of NS in a time period of three weeks \nhad the most decrease in lung tissue inflammation.\nDiscussion\nThis study analyzed the microscopical changes and structural \nremodeling of lung tissue caused by inflammation in it through im -\nplementation of a period of increasing interval exercise followed by \ndifferent patterns of tapering during maturation period. Since changes \nin the control groups can indicate changes in the lung tissue during \nmaturation period, this study was designed to analyze the maturation \nprocess as well. The age range for the research protocol was 5-14 weeks. \nAccording to Sengupta14 this age range in rats is equivalent to the \nage range of 6-16 years old in humans. Therefore the male rats in the \ncontrol groups, treated and untreated with NS, were in their maturation \nperiod in the second week of tapering. It is assumed that the significant \nincrease of lung tissue inflammation in these groups is due to being \nin the critical period of maturation which is related to developmental \nchanges of immune system brought about by maturation and increasing \nefficiency of antigenic system9. \nOur results showed that the implementation of increasing interval \nexercise during maturation period causes severe lung tissue inflamma -\ntion and leads the inflammatory and lymphoid cells into it. Although the \namount of lung tissue inflammation in different periods and different \npatterns has decreased in animals both treated and untreated with NS \nhydro-alcoholic extract, but it is still significantly higher in comparison \nto the basic and control groups. It is concluded that this is because of \nthe downfall of immune system which occurs following a high-intensity \nexercise over a long period of time5. \nAlthough several different studies have been done about the influ -\nence of high intensity exercise on the immune system and the inflam -\nmatory factors in the body, but this study is unique for the microscopical \nanalysis it makes on the influence of high intensity exercise on the immune \nsystem of lung tissue and occurrence of inflammation in it, using histolog -\nical and stereological methods. A few studies have been done about the \neffects of high intensity exercise on immune system function The presence \nof pulmonary macrophages is very essential in adjusting the acute and \nchronic inflammatory responses and the call of into the spreadable site of \ninflammation in the lung29. Michna et al.30 observed that, after a period of \nintense training, the immigrant peritoneal macrophages of humans and \nmice had a better performance in responding to the chemotactic factors. \nThe previous studies showed that acute and chronic exercise training has \nan effective catalytic role in many macrophage functions. On the other \nhand, the increasing rate of macrophage function varies according to the \nintensity and duration of exercise31.\nPrevious study by Sobhani et al.32 showed that HIIT in maturing \nrats cause in airway narrowing of the lung parenchyma. Yadegari et \nal.33 also indicated that HIIT leads to parenchymal remodeling in lung \ntissue by induction of inflammation. Our recent research revealed that six weeks HIIT significantly increase number of alveolar macrophage in \nlung tissue34. Review of Ramel et al.35, Murphy et al.36 and Yamamoto et \nal.37 studies suggested that high intensity physical activities increases \nthe number of neutrophils, while this increase has not been observed \nin low intensity physical activities.\nSome studies showed that, the function of lymphocytes, in long \nperiods, is sensitive to the increase of exercise intensity in endurance \nactivities38,39. It can be concluded that, high intensity exercises decrease \nthe function of lymphocytes and macrophages due to an increase in \nthe circulation of stress hormones, especially cortisol, and a change in \nthe balance of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines when \nresponding to the exercise training38. In a study conducted on 18 swim -\nmers on the national level and 11 healthy untrained volunteers, it was \nfound out that the number of monocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cell \nsubsets as well as the amount of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-12 decreases in these \nathletes during the training season. The results of this study supported \nthe idea that long-term high intensity exercise may affect the innate \nimmune cells function, reduce their capacity in responding to acute \nchallenges, and increase the risk of URTI40. \nPrevious studies have shown that daily repeated physical activity \nduring long periods, in athletes and especially endurance athletes, in -\nduces damage to the epithelium cells and increases the inflammation \nin their respiratory mucosa41. Thus, it can be concluded that despite of \nmultiple mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity being there, the \nimplementation of high intensity exercise training, weakens the immune \nsystem of the lung tissue. The reported severity of inflammation in the \nlung tissue of IIT animals in this study also confirms this possibility.\nFor a reduction of disorders in immune system, physiological \ncapacity and mood state profiles of athletes following a long-term \nand intensive exercise, performing a taper with a gradual reduction in \nthe load of exercise can be recommended by the sport trainers to the \nathletes as an appropriate approach13. The results of this study showed \nthat the implementation of taper patterns (frequency, repetition and \nintensity) after a period of IIT, could significantly decrease the lung \ntissue inflammation caused by intensive exercise training but the in -\nflammation was still significantly higher in comparison to the control \ngroup after 3 weeks of taper. Regarding the time effect of the taper, the \nimplementation of a three-week repetition and intensity taper was more \neffective in enhancing the immune system and reducing the lung tissue \ninflammation subsequent to intensive exercise than a two-week taper. \nThe results of this study were in line with previous studies3,42.\nMujica et al .42, having observed the trained athletes during 1-3 \nweeks of taper, reported enhanced performance often accompanied \nby increased anabolic activity, reduced physiological stress and resto -\nration of mucosal immunity and immune function. It has also been \nshown that a 6-day taper in the middle-distance runners improved the \nperformance in 800 meter runners16. Two weeks taper in triathletes43, \none week taper in rugby league players44,45 and two weeks taper in judo \nathletes11 resulted in increased T/C ratio and improved performance. It \ncan be concluded that the recovery or the enhancement of immune \nsystem function during taper is dependent on the amount of immune \nsystem diminution during intensive exercises3.\nOn the other hand, by the increase of volume and intensity of train -\ning during the pre-competitive season, sport trainers will also concern Shadmehr Mirdar, et al.98\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):92-99about serious matters other than increased risk of sport injuries and \nURTI development. One of these concerns is the increasing tendency \nof athletes to take sport medicines and chemical supplements, some \nof which are completely ineffective in long term use3. Herbal drugs and \nsupplements as natural treatment (complementary treatment) with \nfewer side effects and multiple properties can be the best alternative \nfor athletes46.\nIn the last three decades, extensive research has been done on \nthe biological effects of NS seeds. In numerous scientific articles, the \nantioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immune booster and antihistamines \nproperties of numerous compounds in NS hydro-alcoholic extract \nhave been pointed out47. One of the special features of NS is its role in \nregulating immune function in treadmill exercised rat25. The effect of NS \nhydro-alcoholic extracts use on the reduction of lung tissue inflamma -\ntion23,24 specially induced by intensive exercise training has also been \nobserved in this study. While the implementation of different patterns \nof taper reduced the lung tissue inflammation, but NS hydro-alcoholic \nextracts use enhanced this reduction.\nAlthough the amount of lung tissue inflammation in the animals \nsignificantly decreased in all three types of taper treated with NS, in \ncomparison to their counterparts, but the implementation of three \nweeks of intensity and repetition taper accompanied by NS hydro-al -\ncoholic extracts use, was more effective in the reduction of lung tissue \ninflammation induced by intensive exercise. Previous studies have \nindicated that some of NS compounds have the effect of reinforcing \nthe cellular immunity48. Thymoquinone's anti-inflammatory properties, \nthe major compound of NS extract, works through the suppression of \ninflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes49,50.\nThis study is among the few studies that examine the effect of \ntaper on lung tissue safety mechanism during maturation period. The \nresults of this study showed that although increase of interval training \nintensity has been undulating and gradual but the immune system \nof the lung tissue is not able to cope with that and it causes severe \ninflammation in the lung tissue. This problem during pre-maturation \nperiod may have a negative effect on the performance of the athletes \nand the results of the competition or even negative effects on the \nfuture of their sport. Our results indicated that the implementation of \nthree types of taper decreases the lung tissue inflammation induced \nby IIT. It can be concluded that a reduction in the load of exercise alone \ncan compensate for the induced weakness, or enhance the immune \nfunction so that the lung tissue inflammation decreases. But since the \ninteractive effect of NS hydro-alcoholic extract use and taper was more \neffective in the reduction of lung tissue inflammation, we can conclude \nthat reducing the exercise load accompanied by NS hydro-alcoholic \nextract use associated with particular anti- inflammatory properties, \nhas a more prominent role in safety mechanism of lung tissue. Thus \nthe implementation of taper along with NS hydro-alcoholic extract use \nwill enhance the immune system of the lung tissue during maturation \nperiod and subsequently reduces the induced damages. It may also \nmake the sport life span longer. Decrease of the intensity or frequency \nof the exercise load is a good pattern for taper program. However the \nresults of the study revealed that the implementation of 3 weeks taper is \nmore effective in the reduction of lung tissue inflammation than 2 weeks \ntaper. It is suggested in the future studies, Changes in various factors of innate and adaptive immunity of lung tissue in pre-maturation period \ninduced by increasing interval exercise or taper as well as the optimal \ntaper duration in human models should be studied.\nAcknowledgment\nThis study was financially supported by Research Council of Uni -\nversity of Mazanderan and University of Tabriz.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors do not declare a conflict of interest.\nBibliography\n 1.

Un aspecto especial fue estudiar las razones y consecuencias del uso de llamadas \n\u201cmedicamentos de estilo de vida\u201d (LD).\nPara llevar a cabo esta revisi\u00f3n, se realiz\u00f3 una b\u00fasqueda de art\u00edculos cient\u00edficos en ingl\u00e9s recientes en PubMed, libros y monograf\u00edas de diferentes disciplinas, as\u00ed como documentos oficiales e informes de algunas organizaciones reconocidas internacionalmente (Agencia Europea de Medicamentos, Agencia mundial Antidopaje, Agencia Reguladora de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios).El papel endocrinol\u00f3gico de los A es generalmente conocido, pero sus efectos no hormonales siguen siendo objeto de una investigaci\u00f3n intensiva. Durante d\u00e9cadas, la testosterona (T) y sus \u00e9steres han sido la primera elecci\u00f3n para terapia de sustituci\u00f3n en condiciones cl\u00ednicas claramente definidas. Cuando se trata del desarrollo farmac\u00e9utico, hay una gran cantidad de formulaciones de T eficaces y seguras en el mercado que proporcionan un muy buen cumplimiento por parte de los pa -\ncientes.

Special aspect was to explore the reasons and consequences of A use as so-called \n\u2018\u2019lifestyle drugs\u2019\u2019 (LD). To write this review, we used the scientific papers in English of a recent date on PubMed, reference textbooks, books and monographs of different disciplines, as well as official documents and reports of some internationally recognized organizations (European Medicines Agency, World Anti-Doping Agency, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency).Endocrinological role of A is generally known, but their non-hormonal effects are still the subject of intensive investigation. For decades, testosterone (T) and its esters have been the substitution therapy of the first choice in clearly defined clinical conditions. When it comes to pharmaceutical development, there are large number of effective and safe T formulations on the market which provide a very good patients\u2019 compliance. Regarding clinical application of synthetic A with dominant anabolic activity, the only acceptable indication nowadays is severe burn injuries, while others have to be proven by high-quality clinical studies. Particularly worrying is the wide-spread use of anabolic steroids (AS) for non-medical purposes, as so-called LD. Although numerous and serious side-effects are well-documented, general impression is that both users of AS and clinicians should know more about the risks of their use.This review points to the need of better information and more comprehensive education at different levels, as well as im-plementation of additional preventive strategies, especially in the youth population, in order to avoid potentially serious consequences of the AS use.

Later, at schools and \nfaculties of health care, students learn about diseases and conditions that \nresult from their insufficient or excessive secretion. Medical doctors and pharmacists know most about A as medicines, while other professions, \nas well as the general public, know very superficially or to the extent \nof their own needs or interests. As with many other medicines, some indications for A use are unquestionable and generally accepted from \nboth clinicians and regulatory bodies, while others are still waiting for \nvalid evidence. \nHowever, unlike most other drugs it is well-known that different \nsubstances with androgenic actions were used by people without any medical diagnosis, in order to increase muscle mass, strength and en -\ndurance\n1-4. Available data show that those were first German soldiers1, \nlater Russian and American athletes2,3, and since the eighties of the last \ncentury these substances have \"entered\" into the widest population \nof young and middle-aged individuals whose physical appearance \nand muscle mass have become the basic life preoccupation4. In official \nliterature these substances got the status of lifestyle drugs (LD)5. Possible \nrisks and consequences of their use, including cases of death, are well-\ndocumented6-8. The extent and importance of this problem is indicated \nby the data that in some countries, such as Netherlands, an outpatient clinic for past and current users of those substances was established \nin 2011 in order to acquire more knowledge about the health risks associated with anabolic androgenic steroids abuse\n9. \nThe objective of this review was to evaluate critically and in detail \nthe current cognition about A physiology, their pharmaceutical deve -\nlopment and place in modern medicine. Special aspect was to explore the reasons and potential consequences of their use for non-medical \npurposes as so-called LD and to point out the importance of better \neducation and preventive strategies in this area, especially in youth population. \nMethods\nVarious literary sources were used to write this review. Initial \ndata were obtained from textbooks, monographs and other books in \npharmacology and clinical pharmacology, physiology, pharmacy, en -\ndocrinology and various sports sciences. The inclusion criteria for these \npublications were the following: a publication of a newer date which \nis internationally recognized (or used in university teaching), written in \nEnglish and issued by a renowned publisher. Older date publications that are not of an international character and not published in English \nwere not taken into account. For a more detailed insight into individual \nparts of this review, we searched the \u201cPubMed\u201d database, using a number of keywords and determinations. Here the criteria for inclusion were \nthe following: publication had to be original scientific paper or review \n(including studies on animals and other types of experimental studies) published in English in the period 2000-2018. Priority was given to the \nresults of randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies with a \nlarge number of participants. In exceptional cases, older papers were quoted, where this was of substantial importance for the research sub -\nject. Case studies, papers without the author's name and papers which \nweren't written in English were not taken into consideration. The last \nsource of information was official websites of internationally recognized regulatory institutions (European Medicines Agency-EMA, Medicines \nand Healthcare products Regulatory Agency-MHRA and World Anti-\nDoping Agency-WADA) from which the latest reports, recommendations and documents were taken. The authors accessed these sites for the \nlast time in November 2018.\nAndrogens as physiologically important \nsubstances - can we live without them?\nTestosterone (T) is a major natural A. It is mostly synthesized in \ntesticular Leydig's cells and smaller amounts in the ovaries and adrenal \ncortex from cholesterol as the initial substance. In a healthy adult male, \n4-9 mg of T is excreted daily and only 1-2% is free in plasma10.\nAndrogenic effects of T are spermatogenesis and development \nof primary and secondary sexual characteristics of a man, including characteristic hair distribution on the body, baldness, a specific voice depth, increased skin thickness and firmness of the subcutaneous tissue, \nincreased secretion of the sebaceous glands with the appearance of \nacne, etc. Anabolic effects of T include protein synthesis and muscle development, bone growth and calcium storage, increased basal me -\ntabolism, increased number of erythrocytes, and others\n11. Behavioral \neffects of T include the regulation of sexuality, aggression, cognition, \nemotion, and personality12,13.\nT precursors, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedion \nare less potent A which are synthesized in the gonads and adrenal cortex \nin both sexes. In the liver they are being converted into more potent T\n14. DHEA and its metabolites regulate glandular and neurotransmiter \nsecretions, influence glucose homeostasis and cyclic release of GnRH, \ncontrol the activity of skeletal and smooth muscle and increase the \ntolerance to ishemia15. Additional neuroprotective effects, positive mo -\ndification of human mood, emotions and behavior were also found16. \nAlthough in recent decades the popularity of these substances has \ngrown because of their use in doping17, existing data doesn't confirm \ntheir effectiveness regarding the lean body mass, muscle strength or performance improvement compared with placebo\n18,19 (Figures 1 and 2). \nIn most peripheral tissues T is being converted in more active \ndihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5alpha-reductase. Inhibitors of this en -\nzyme (finasteride and dutasteride) have being traditionally used in the \nFigure 1.

Their use reduces the inci -\ndence of low-grade prostatic carcinoma in high-risk patients20,21. Recent \nstudies in experimental animals have found some non-hormonal effects \nof these medicines, such as reduction of dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease, \nanti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory actions and the improvement of motor, EEG and celular changes in hepatic encephalopathy\n22-24. This \ncould expand the existing knowledge about A physiology and open \nnew possibilities in the treatment of some CNS diseases. Paba S, et al.25 \nidentified the 5alpha-reductase as possible novel therapeutic target in \nthe treatment of schizophrenia.\nAndrogens as medicines - is the science \nfully dedicated exclusively to the well-being of the patient?\nThere have always been pathological states that have caused a lack \nor complete absence of A in the body of a man, with accompanying \nclinical manifestations. In that sense, it was imposed the need for desig -\nning and synthesizing substances which could, if applied exogenously, \nreplace their deficiency and improve clinical symptoms. According to \nrecent data, approximately 2.4 million males in USA aged 40-69 years \nold suffer from hypogonadism26. About 2.3% of men in their 40s and \n3.8% of men in their 60s were taking some form of T replacement \ntherapy in 201127. \nTestosterone and testosterone esters\nKnowing the fact that T administered orally is the subject of so-\ncalled ''metabolism of the first pass'' through the liver to a significant \nextent14, Butenandt and Ruzicka synthesized T in the injection for the \nfirst time in 1935, that is considered as the beginning of the golden age of steroid chemistry. Four years later these scientists got the Nobel \nPrize in Chemistry\n1. However, T administered even in this way had a \nshort duration of action due to intense biotransformation (half-life of \n10 minutes)28, so patients were forced to receive it frequently.\nIn order to ensure the prolonged action of T, the science went on. \nIn the 1940s and 1950s, the first T esters were synthesized (propionate, \ncypionate, enanthate). These esters are still in use and they are administe -\nred as intramuscular depot injection at intervals of 1-6 weeks, according \nto patients individual requirement29,30. \nIn the mid-seventies there was a new progress. It was synthesized T \nundecanoate, also T ester in the form of depot intramuscular injection10. \nIt has provided stable plasma levels of T over three months, which has \nbeen a significant advantage for patients31 (Figure 3). Certainly, the revolutionary discovery of the 1980s was transdermal \napplication of T as an alternative to painful injection28. The first effective \ntransdermal patches were applied in the scrotum area because of very good pharmacokinetics and potency\n10,29. Smaller skin surface area \nand application challenges (hair clipping), as well as the apparence of transdermal patches which could be applied at back, abdomen, upper \narms or thighs limited the use of formulations for scrotum application\n29. \nFurther discoveries went in the direction of hydroalcoholic gels/\nliquid solutions for transdermal absorption10. In order to minimize \ntransfer, recommended sites for their application are areas which will \nbe covered by clothing29. There are also formulations for application to \nbuccal mucosa, from which T is gradually absorbed, bypassing hepatic metabolism\n10. Modern T implants for subcutaneous administration \nprovide the replacement of T for a period of even 6 months29. The latest \ndiscovery was nasal gel, as another non-invasive treatment29. \nSynthetic androgens \nThere were three main reasons for design and synthesis of synthetic \nandrogens (SA): the possibility of oral administration, the prolongation of biological activity in vivo and the increase of anabolic compared to \nandrogenic effects\n32. Those modifications were expected to improve the \npossibility of clinical application of SA, that can be considered justified \nfrom the professional, scientific and ethical point of view.\nOral activity was achieved by substitution of the 17 \u03b1-H on the \nsteroid nucleus with a methyl or ethyl group, which prevented the deactivation by first-pass metabolism in the liver\n12. Methyltestosterone \nwas the first synthesized medicine in this group (1935), and others were synthesized later\n17. However, the attempt to introduce these medicines \ninto the long-acting replacement therapy (LART) was unsuccessful because of their hepatotoxicity\n17. \nAnother form of structural modification of A was 5 \u03b1- reduction. \nMesterolone was synthesized in this way, but it's oral administration in \nLART was limited due to relatively weak pharmacological activity12 and \nunconfirmed efficacy in standard doses33.\nNandrolone (N) is 19-demethylated analogue of T which also \ncannot be taken orally because of extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver\n34. However, the third goal (very high ratio of anabolic to \nandrogenic action12 was achieved with N, that could be an explana -\ntion for its current status of the most popular A in sports doping and \nbodybuilding35 (Figure 4). \nFigure 2. Structural formula of androstenedione. Figure 3. Structural formula of testosterone undecanoate.\nNata\u0161a Duborija-Kovacevic, et al.104\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):101-108In order to enable its medical application, there were developed \nlong-acting pro-drug esters of N (but not for oral use, for intramuscular \ninjection again!), such as N decanoate (ND). Both experimental and \nclinical studies confirmed positive effects of ND on bone tissue. Li X et al. found ND blocked bone loss by inhibition of bone resorption in \novariectomized rats with osteopenia\n36. Newer investigation on young \nadult rats found a positive effect of ND on bone callus formation after a complete femoral fracture\n37. In women with postmenopausal \nosteoporosis ND increases bone density and reduces the incidence of fractures\n38,39, but according to reference recommendations, such as UK \nClinical Guideline for the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis40, \nbisphosphonates are considered as drugs of the first choice. \nAndrogens as medicines - what does the \nevidence-based medicine say?\nSubstitution therapy\nT is used as substitution therapy of the first choice in conditions \nwhich cause primary testicular insufficiency, such as bilateral anorchia, \nKlinefelter's karyotype (XXY), surgical removal of the testes, chemothe -\nrapy and radiotherapy, but also in secondary testicular insufficiency \nwhich occurs as the result of disturbance on the hypothalamic-pituitary \naxis. Another reason for T clinical use is delayed puberty in boys ages \n16 and older10. \nSubstitution of T in aging men in andropause, according to some \nauthors41-43 has a positive effect on bone mineral density and lean mass, \nsexual function, mood, general sense of well-being and reduction of the \namount of adipose tissue. Considering this issue in recent review, Singh \nP concluded that ''disparate results of clinical trials suggest an incom-plete picture of complex interaction between aging and A deficiency''. \nBefore commencing T treatment, he suggested clear discussion with \nthe patient about potential benefits and risks of the therapy, as well as to consider the assessment of prostate and other risk factors\n44. \nControversies regarding the diagnosis of female hypoandroge -\nnism and possible T substitution are still unresolved45. T therapy is not \napproved for women in North America46. In EU, T-containing medicines \nare licensed only for the treatment of male hypogonadism47. Additio -\nnaly, the long-term side effects of T in women have not yet been fully \ninvestigated48,45. Due to relatively weak anabolic effect, as well as adverse A effects, \nT is rarely used in catabolic conditions. The exception is hypogonadism \nas the consequence of the AIDS17. Rabkin JG et al.  found in their double-\nblind, placebo-controlled trial that T is effective and well tolerated in \nthe short-term treatment of clinical hypogonadism in men with symp -\ntomatic HIV illness, restoring libido and energy, alleviating depressed \nmood and increasing muscle mass49. Long-term studies regarding this \nissue are still missing.\nPharmacological therapy\nExcept in physiological doses that are used in replacement therapy, \nA may be administered in considerably higher doses as pharmacological \ntherapy. This type of therapy was mainly used in some non-reproductive \ndiseases in order to improve the patients' quality of life (QoL) by enhan-cing muscle, bone, or other A-sensitive functions, but without ability \nto influence the course of underlining disease\n35. This type of A therapy \nwas mentioned in the literature mostly from the last decades of the XX century for several medical indications, including anemia as a result \nof bone marrow aplasia or renal failure\n50-51, osteoporosis38-39, advanced \nER-positive breast cancer52-53, endometriosis54-55, burn injuries56-57, and \nothers35,58. Woerdeman J, et al.59 analyzed relevant clinical studies with \nanabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) in the treatment of non-hormonal \nchronic disorders published in the period 1950-2010 and they concluded \nthat although the beneficial effects of AAS were promising, clinically \nrelevant endpoints such as QoL, improved physical functioning and \nsurvival were mainly missing or not significant, except for burn injuries. \nBoth Woerdeman59 and Handelsman35 pointed to the need for addi -\ntional, high-quality clinical studies with the exact clinical end points in order to confirm the long term safety and efficacy of AAS in other \nnon-hormonal clinical conditions. An additional reason for current status \nof A as adjuvant, supportive or adjunctive second-line therapy is the \nintroduction of newer, more selective and more effective medicines in \nthese indications (erythropoietins for anemia in renal failure, biphos -\nphonates for osteoporosis, etc.). \nAfter the previously stated, it can be concluded that modern, \nevidence-based medicine clearly positions T and its esters as the first-\nline therapy in LART in men, but when it comes to the pharmacological \napplication of SA with dominant anabolic activity, the only reasonable \nindication is severe burn injuries, while others have to be proven. \nAnabolic steroids - medical indications as a \ngoal or a justification?\nAccording to Thieme D, et al.1, anabolic steroids (AS) were first \nsynthesized by German scientists during the Second World War, shortly \nafter the discovery of T itself. They are believed to have been tested on \npeople, especially prisoners, but those results have never been publis-\nhed. Some personal war experiences of the surviving German soldiers speak of how they were given AS in order to increase the strength and aggressiveness. Adolf Hitler also used steroids in order to strengthen his \naggressive personality, that was confirmed by notes of his doctor\n1. Thus, \nthe first use  of AS in healthy people and for non-medical purposes was Figure 4. Structural formula of nandrolone.\nAndrogens from physiology, through pharmacy and pharmacology to the status of lifestyle drugs - are we going in the right direction?105\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):101-108in German soldiers during the Second World War in order to increase \ntheir strength, endurance and aggressiveness. \nThe use of AS in athletes was noted for the first time at the weight -\nlifting championships in Vienna in 1954 by Russian competitors2. Two \nyears later CIBA Laboratories in Basel synthesized metandienone (Dia -\nnabol\u00ae) for the US Olympic Team3. In following decades A abuse quickly \nspread into competition bodybuilding, track and field events and other \nsports where performance is dependent on muscle strength or speed \nof recovery during training60. \nHowever, at the beginning of 1980s, the conditions were changed \nglobally and AS gradually shifted from top-class sports to the general population\n4. According to Kanayama G, et al .4, a typical \u201cuser\u201d of AS \nnowadays is young to middle-aged man whose motivation for their \nuse is primarily personal appearance and muscle mass. It is clear that \nthe use of those substances in this context is not caused by any existing medical diagnosis. \nAlthough 23 different definitions of LD can be found in the litera -\nture\n61, the most operational one is that \u201cLD are drugs that could modify \nor change non-medical or non-health-related goal or conditions at the \nmargins of health and wellbeing\u201d 62,63. The examples of LD should be \nsildenafil citrate in the treatment of erectile dysfunction, minoxidil for the baldness, botulinum toxin for \u201cironing\u201d wrinkles, etc.\n61 Satisfying the \ncriteria of LD definition, AS \u201cfound their place\u201d among substances of the modern times which alter not only the personal appearance, but also \nthe physical and mental capabilities. Although all of these substances have the status of LD, a significant difference should be noticed: erectile \ndysfunction and male-pattern hair loss are official medical diagnoses \nthat are treated by licensed medicines, but facial wrinkles and personal dissatisfaction with the amount and tonus of muscle mass in own body \nare not yet, that doesn't mean that they will not be soon. Or, maybe \nthey actually exist, but we still don't know their name(s).\nDesigner steroids - did things get out of \ncontrol?\nDesigner steroids (DS) are AAS which are synthesized from a known \nparent steroid and chemically modified with the intent to circumvent \ncontrolled substances laws64-65. They are often identical to physiological \nsubstances and/or their metabolites whose concentrations in human plasma otherwise vary significantly, which makes it difficult to detect \nthem\n5. The first DS, tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) was discovered in 2003 \nin the Olympic Analytical Laboratory at the University of California, Los \nAngeles66 (Figure 5). The disappointing thing is that, unlike the previously described \nAS, the discovery and development of DS have never been linked (in \ntheory or practice) with any medical indication, which could justify their design and synthesis to a certain extent, at least from the ethical \npoint of view. Cheating athletes have a double motivation to use DS: to \nachieve performance enhancement and to escape from testing positive in anti-doping tests. Both can be considered as deception in sport and \nhuman sense. The fact that the first and probably many other DS were \nsynthesized in laboratories belonging to universities could be conside -\nred as the deception of science. In their discovery and development are \nworking persons (scientists) for which the ethics and the truth should be \nthe basic principles of their professional dealing. An increasing number of DS on the market which are mainly sold as dietary supplements\n67 \nshould be the next fraud in sequence. \u201cBypassing\u201d a strong regulatory rules that refer to licensed medicines, DS become more easily accessible \nand potentially more dangerous for end-users. \nAccording to Pope HG, et al.  (2004), AAS users rated physicians as no \nmore reliable source of information about those substances than their friends, Internet sites, or the persons who sold them the steroids\n68. On \nthe other side, most general practitioners had some contact with AAS users in their practice, but only 40% of them reported that they would \nbe willing to provide harm minimization advice\n69. \nPreviously stated indicates the seriousness and complexity of \nthis phenomenon globally, as well as the need for additional effective actions at different fields. \nHow anabolic steroids act on healthy \nhuman organism - do we know possible consequences?\nFor years, AS have been the most commonly detected doping \nsubstances in athletes70. In 2015, according to the WADA report, AS \nparticipated exactly 50% in all positive findings on doping71. In combi -\nnation with training and high protein intake, AS undoubtedly increase \nmuscle mass and body weight, but there is little evidence that they \nincrease muscle strength more than it would have been possible by the training itself, or that their use would improve sports results in general\n5.\nGiven the disturbing fact that in the last decades AS have been \nincreasingly used to improve the physical appearance of young people who are not primarily athletes\n4 for aesthetic, psychological, sociological \nand other non-medical and non-sporting reasons, then we can state \nregrettably that, in this sense, these substances are likely to satisfy the \nneeds of their users, at least for a limited period. On the other hand, since they are applied for a long time in supra-physiological doses, which are \nusually up to 50-100 times higher compared to endogenously produced \nT in an adult healthy male\n72, their application is associated with long-term \nand serious adverse effects, of which cardiovascular, neuroendocrine \nand psychiatric are dominant6,7. The entity of side effects depends on \nthe sex, the dose, the duration of treatment, whether AS are taken during exercise training or under sedentary conditions, and individual \nsusceptibility to A exposure\n73. \nAdverse cardiovascular disorders include hypertension, an increase \nof LDL and reduced HDL, potentiation of thrombosis and cardiac arr -\nFigura 5. Structural formula of tetrahydrogestrinone.Nata\u0161a Duborija-Kovacevic, et al.106\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):101-108hythmias, cardiomy opathy, left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial \nischemia74,75. Melchert and Welder76 categorized cardiovascular effects \nof AS in four types of actions: vasospastic, atherogenic, thrombotic and \ndirect myocardial injuries. Frati P , et al. (2015) identified nineteen sudden \ncardiac deaths (SCD) in AS users in the period 1990-20128, which proba -\nbly could be attributed to an imbalance of autonomous nervous system activity\n77. Some authors suggest that in the cases of SCD in athletes the \nuse of AS should be ex cluded74.\nThe endocrinological effects of AS depend on the age and sex of \nthe person using them14. In adult males, anabolic effects may be ac -\ncompanied by salt and water retention. The skin becomes thick and often darker, the sebaceous glands become more active, resulting \nin the appearance of acne\n14. AS use causes gynecomastia, priapism, \nhypogonadism, inhibits spermatogenesis and reduces the man's fer -\ntility78. These influences adversely affect the mood, that forces a man \nto take these substances repeatedly. BPH and prostate cancer in AS \nusers were also described78. In women AS cause hairiness, male pattern \nbaldness, menstrual cycle disorders, breast atrophy, changes in voice depth, acne, etc.\n14,78\nAt the psychological plane, AS cause a sense of well-being, increase \ncompetitive spirit and aggressiveness, in some cases even to the level of psychosis\n14. Violence, aggression and impulsivity are explained by some \nauthors as the consequence of decrease in the functional correlation of key centers in the brain responsible for emotional and cognitive \nbehavioral regulation\n79. Depression which usually requires long-term \npsychiatric treatment develops very often at the end of applied \"cycle\" \nof AS5. A numerous cases of suicide in AS users with some specificities \nin comparison to suicides caused by psychoactive substances were described\n80,81. AS users more easily take other substances in order to \nincrease muscle mass, reduce fat tissue and improve body appearance82. \nThese substances, so-called \u201cbody image drugs\u201d include other hormones (growth hormone, insulin), beta-agonists (clenbuterol), stimulants (am -\nphetamine, ephedrine), laxatives, diuretics, etc.\n82 Even greater problem is \nthat AS users are more likely to reach to so-called \u201cstreet\u201d drugs, predo -\nminantly opiates, compared to people who do not use AS83. Particularly \nworrying are the results of Arvary and Pope84 according to which 9% of \nmale sex heroic users began using it during the use of AS, that as many as 81% of respondents bought opiate for the first time from the same \ndealer who sold them AS, and 67% of the respondents took opiates in \norder to fight with AS abstinence syndrome. Ten years ago, Graham et al. accused the medical profession who didn't accept the fact that AAS use dependency is a psychiatric condition\n85. \nAdverse effects of AS on the liver include adenomas, hepatocellular \ncarcinoma, cholestasis and peliosis hepatis86,87. Bond P , et al.88 assume \noxidative stress as the causative factor of AS-induced hepatotoxicity.\nAt the end of this chapter, the question arises is there the need \nto use other medicines in order to cure the \u201clifestyle improvement\u201d \ncaused by AS?\nConclusions\nThe hormonal effects of A are generally known in the professional, \nbut also in general population, through various ways and levels of \nformal and informal education and experience. Scientists' attention is now occupied by non-hormonal effects of A, metabolites and enzymes \ninvolved in their biotransformation. These substances and enzymes have been shown to influence the various aspects of human functioning, \nprimarily the CNS, that opens up the new possibilities in the treatment \nof certain diseases. \nIn clinical terms, T and its esters are clearly positioned as the first \nline replacement therapy in male hypoandrogenism, while T-containing medicines, in the absence of effective evidence, are still not licensed for women. When it comes to the type and selection of T pharmaceutical \nformulations, it can be concluded that there is a fairly wide selection \nof effective and safe preparations, both traditional and modern, which ensures a good patients compliance and minimal negative impact on \ntheir QoL.\nWhen SA are concerned, it can be concluded that in the pharma -\ncokinetic sense their discovery and development fulfilled the expec -\ntations, but in clinical terms it is still not the case. Although there are \nundoubtedly promising results, scientific and professional community are still expecting the outcomes of high-quality clinical studies in order \nto confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of SA in most non-hormonal \nclinical conditions they are proposing.\nHowever, thanks to their anabolic properties, SA have long been \npresent in the population of healthy people without medical diagnosis. \nFirst of all they were soldiers, and then athletes. In the past decades, \ntight muscle and physical appearance were imposed as superior living values, which SA \u201chave dropped\u201d into the population of \u201cordinary\u201dpeople \naround the world and give them the status of LD in reference literature. \nIt went so far that nowadays DS are synthesized and used as dietary \nsupplements without any medical reason, in order to deceive in achie -\nving sports results and to circumvent the institutional control, that is disappointing from many aspects. \nExisting research shows that both healthcare professionals and \nAS users don't know enough about them.

El \u00faltimo caso conocido es el de la atleta sudafricana Caster Semenya, ganadora de la final de los 800 m en el Campeonato del Mundo de atletismo de Berl\u00edn de 2009 con 2:45 segundos menos que la segunda clasificada, a la que super\u00f3 en 16 m en la recta final.Tras multitud de estudios, se comprob\u00f3 que la atleta presentaba una condici\u00f3n m\u00e9dica denominada diferencia del desarrollo sexual (DSD), con producci\u00f3n de elevados niveles de testosterona.Las cifras elevadas de testosterona, con sensibilidad a esta hormona en mujeres, pueden suponer una enorme ventaja en el rendimiento deportivo, que se ha cuantificado en un rango sobre el 9%.La Federaci\u00f3n Internacional de Atletismo (IAAF) ha promulgado una normativa que obliga a las atletas femeninas con altos niveles de testosterona y sensibilidad a la misma, que quieren participar en pruebas de 400 m a la milla, a disminuir las cifras de testosterona mediante la utilizaci\u00f3n de estr\u00f3genos.Este trabajo analiza los sistemas de clasificaci\u00f3n deportiva, los efectos fisiol\u00f3gicos de la testosterona, las bases de la diferen -\nciaci\u00f3n sexual, y presenta los argumentos m\u00e9dicos y deontol\u00f3gicos para rebatir la obligaci\u00f3n de tratamiento hormonal de mujeres para poder competir en especialidades deportivas.Palabras clave:  \nClasificaci\u00f3n deportiva. Diferenciaci\u00f3n \ndel estado sexual. DSD. Testosterona. \nRendimiento. Atletismo.  \nNormas deportivas.Summary\nThe classification systems for sports competition are based primarily on the sex of the athlete and generate the male and \nfemale categories in almost all existing sports.There have been some cases of fraud, in which men have competed in the female category, and others, in which some female competitors have caused suspicions about their sex. The last known case is the South African athlete Caster Semenya, who won the final of the 800 m in the World Championships in Berlin in 2009 with 2.45 seconds less than the second classified, with a distance of 16 m in the final straight.After a multitude of studies, it was verified that the athlete presented a medical condition called difference of the sexual development (DSD), with a production of high levels of testosterone.High testosterone levels, with sensitivity to this hormone in women, may represent a huge advantage in sports performance, which has been quantified by a range over 9%.The International Athletics Federation (IAAF) has promulgated a rule requiring female athletes with high levels of testosterone and sensitive to it, who want to participate in 400m to a mile tests, to decrease testosterone levels by using estrogens. This work analyses sports classification systems, the physiological effects of testosterone, the basis of sexual differentiation, and presents the medical and deontological arguments to refute the obligation of hormonal treatment of women to be able to compete in sports.Key words:  \nSports classification.  \nDifferentiation of sexual state. \nDSD.

All this was particularly significant in the case of the South African athlete \nmentioned above. This female athlete won the women\u2019s 800 m trial \nin the 2009 World Championship in Berlin with a time of 1:55.45 min, while the athlete coming in second took 1: 57.90: a difference of 2.45 \nseconds i.e. a distance of more than 16 meters (Figure 1). In this 800 m trial Semenya won the final of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro \n2016 and was World Champion in Berlin in 2009 and in London in 2017. \nHer best time was 1:54.25 and she also won international competitions \nbetween 400 m and 1500 m. However, it should be borne in mind that she was also defeated on the track in the 800 m women\u2019s race in the \nLondon Olympics in 2012 and the 2011 Daegu World Championship, \nboth times by an athlete who was subsequently stripped of both gold medals for having used doping and who was suspended for that reason \nfor 4 years. Both medals were then also awarded to Caster Semenya.\nThe case of Semenya has been giving rise to speculations in the me -\ndia, like she had used doping substances, or that she was in fact a man.\nAs a result of all this, Semenya has undergone a number of different \nmedical and genetic studies, some of whose results seem unfortunately \nto have been leaked to the media. In the case of other studies, numerous \nspeculations have been reported. What seems clear is that the athlete \nsuffers from androgenism and that she has a blood testosterone level higher than the reference values for women of her characteristics.\nBefore moving forward, it must be considered that other elite athle -\ntes have also been subjected to intense media exposure for the same reasons: their physical appearance and exceptional sports performance. The perception that several of them are competing or have competed at the highest level in the 800 m trial, like the holder herself of the world record for that distance (1: 53.28 since 1983) seems very strange.\nBack in 2010, Semenya underwent a thorough examination by a \ngroup of specialists who determined that she should compete as a wo -\nman and without any limitation. However, her exceptional performance \nand its media impact led the IAAF to look for a method to avoid such \nmajor differences between competitors, to the point of producing the regulations of 2018, already cited\n1.\nAs a result of all the above, this report aims to analyse the regulations \nthat the IAAF intends to impose in order to reduce the differences in performance in women's athletics, from the points of view of Sports Ethics and especially of Medicine.\nPhysiological aspects \nIt is undeniably clear that men have significant advantages in mus -\ncle size, strength and power, compared with women. Table 1, produced \nby the authors, shows the percentage differences between men and \nwomen, in some of the world records in athletics. To this end, only trials where women and men competed under equal conditions (ruling out \nobstacle races, which have different height, and throwing with different \nweights) have been considered. In order to compare these differences in jumps and races, the records of female athletes have been expressed by \ntransforming the record time into the race speed (metres per second\n-1).\nGenerally, this difference is quantified as a 10-12% advantage for \nmen1. This is attributed to man's higher testosterone levels from puberty, \namong other possible causes. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of the advantage that a higher rate of testosterone provides are clearly \ndescribed\n2.\nFigure 1.

In addition, it can be seen how, in the case \nof jumps, where rapid use of muscle strength is of major importance, the \ndifferences are greater (advantages for male athletes are between 14.7% and 17.9%). Although this cannot be compared, one could venture that \nit is very possible that in throwing that difference would be even greater.\nGender and sport. Classification and \nverification systems\nSport-based classification, separated by gender, in practically all \nsports and sports specialties, is something totally accepted today. The \nalmost insurmountable differences in performance between women and men is the clear reason for this separation.\nTo maintain this separation and avoid the pitfalls in gender clas -\nsification, in 1950 the IAAF set down a regulation including physical \nmedical examinations, regulations that, in the long run, were extended \nto other sports. Back in 1950, an athlete was prevented from continuing \nher sports career due to refusing to undergo one of these medical exa-minations. The standards developed further and in 1966 Barr's chromatin began to be studied in female athletes who wanted to participate in female trials, using the karyotype in a saliva sample as an initial test. If in \nthis test some Y chromosome was detected, medical examinations were \ncarried out, including the morphological verification of external genitalia.\nAlthough these physical explorations ended up being considered \ndegrading and were happily repealed in all sports. In the early 1990s the \nuse of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique was advocated \nfor the extension and examination of DNA strands, as a method which was more objective and scientific.\nFinally, in 2011 the IAAF set down two different regulations, one \nfor people with sex reassignment\n3, and another for female athletes with \nhyperandrogenism4. However, in 2015, a female Indian athlete brought \nan appeal to the CAS regarding her suspension due to a diagnosis of \nhyperandrogenism, after a process described by her, as \u201chorrible and \nhumiliating\u201d . The athlete obtained a favourable ruling, since the CAS finally accepted that there was not enough evidence of the advantage \nthat a higher level of testosterone could produce in female athletes\n5. \nThus, the IAAF regulation on hyperandrogenism was repealed.\nAs can be seen, this is a recurrent issue, which appears to be har -\nming a number of women athletes, until institutions are persuaded \nthat the matter should be left off the agenda. Now, in 2018 and 2019, \nwe are once again in the worst possible position as regards the rights \nof certain athletes.\nSexual differentiation \nBiological gender is a general term that includes different aspects \nof chromosomal, gonadal, hormonal and phenotypic sex, each of which \nis fixed in an individual. Generally, all these classifications of gender are \naligned in a conventional binary: male and female. However, it must be considered that there are congenital conditions that cause misalig -\nnment and atypical development of the chromosomal, gonadal and / \nor anatomical genders. As a medical description of these conditions, terms such as \u201cdisorders or anomalies of sexual development\n6,7 and later \n\u201cintersexual states\u201d or \u201cintersex\u201d began to be used. The term \u201canomalies \nof sexual differentiation\u201d was introduced in 20066, however all of these \nhave been widely contested in the scientific literature6-10.\nCurrently they are classified as \u201cdifferences in sexual development\u201d \nor DSD, although later the term \u201cvariations in sexual development\u201d \n(VSD) was proposed10.\nAs will be seen later, DSD may involve ambiguity of external geni -\ntalia and various combinations of chromosomal genotypes and sexual \nphenotypes other than XX-woman and XY-man7,11. In the administra -\ntive field, there are a number of national systems that recognize legal genders which are different from \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d , such as \u201cintersex\u201d , \u201cX\u201d or \u201cother\u201d .\nDifferent institutions with powers in the field of the protection of \nhuman rights attempt to avoid harmful practices and discrimination against people with these conditions. In 2015, the United Nations High \nCommissioner launched a campaign for the free equality of rights of \npeople classified as \u201cintersex\u201d \n12.\nEqually, in 2015 the Council of Europe made a statement asking \nmember states for a non-binary gender classification and to seriously consider the implications of a new and better classification of \u201cintersex\u201d \nindividuals\n13. In 2016, numerous Committees and U.N. subcommittees \n(Against Torture, of the Rights of the Child, of the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities), together with the Council of Europe and the Human Rights \nCommissions of Africa and the Americas, launched a document calling \nfor an end to the violent and harmful medical practices on \u201cintersex\u201d \nchildren and adults14.\nWe should not forget that disclosing information about the medical \nhistory of any patient can lead to very serious consequences15. Further -\nmore, in these sensitive cases public knowledge of this protected data \nwill have irreparable consequences for the normal physical development \nof young people and the psychosocial sphere of all those affected16,17, \nas established by the World Health Organization18.\nRegarding the embryological aspect of foetal sexual differentiation, \nit should be observed that this encompasses a series of processes whose determination and regulation involve numerous genes, proteins and \nhormones. Starting from a first stage of gonadal and genital develop -\nment (6 weeks post-fertilization), which is common to both sexes, it is in the period of differentiation when these conditions may occur and have \nbeen given the controversial classifications previously identified. These \ncomprise a broad spectrum of discrepancies between chromosomal, gonadal and phenotypic (genital) criteria that define sexual differentia -\ntion and are now considered \u201cDifferences in Sexual Development (DSD)\u201d . \nTheir classification can be seen in Table 2\n19.\nAs regards the involvement of testosterone, it should be remembe -\nred that the majority of women (including elite athletes) have circulating \nblood testosterone levels (0.12-1.79 nmol.L-1) which are lower than those \nof post-pubertal males ((7.7-29.4 nmol.L-1). It is accepted that, in the \nabsence of DSD or tumour, no woman should have serum testosterone \nlevels equal to or greater than 5 nmol.L-1(20).Pedro Manonelles Marqueta, et al.112\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):109-116People with DSD may have very high levels of natural testosterone \nthat may be similar to, or higher than, normal male values20. There is a \nbroad medical and scientific consensus that, if these people are sensitive \nto androgens, i.e. if they have normo-functioning androgen receptors, \nand record such high levels of natural testosterone, their muscle mass, strength and haemoglobin level may also be much higher and, there -\nfore, significantly improve their sports potential\n21-35. It can be considered that an increase of blood testosterone rate in women between 0.9 and 7.3 nmol.L\n-1 produces an increase in muscle mass of 4% and in muscle \nstrength of 12-26%. The increase in testosterone to levels of: 5, 7, 10 \nand 19 nmol.L-1, increases the amount of haemoglobin by 6.5%, 7.8%, \n8.9% and 11%, respectively. \nIt is therefore estimated that the ergogenic advantage of testoste -\nrone levels in the male range instead of the female range is over 9%21.

These substances \nare prohibited at all times (in and out of competition) and in all sports, as Non-Specific Substances in Category S1: Anabolic Agents. These are \nincluded in that list since it has existed, and their use is considered to be a case of utmost seriousness.\nHowever, from the legal point of view, the CAS ruling of 2015 should \nbe recalled\n5, stating that there is not enough evidence of the advantage \nthat a higher rate of testosterone may give to female athletes.\nFor its part, the IAAF has compiled observational data on the effects \nof artificial suppression of high testosterone levels on athletes with DSD, depending on whether or not their testosterone levels are suppressed. \nThe suppression of circulating testosterone levels in the case of three \nfemale athletes with DSD from between 21 and 25 nmol.L\n-1 down to a \nrate below 2 nmol.L-1 led to a decrease in their performance on average \nof 5.7%, as can be observed in Figure 221,37.\nThis study shows that athletes with DSD with circulating testos -\nterone levels in the normal male range have a significant competitive advantage over athletes with testosterone levels in the normal female range, and for the IAFF this would justify forcing these athletes with DSD \nto reduce testosterone levels to the normal female range to continue \ncompeting in the female category.\nApplication of the IAAF regulations1\nSphere\nThe IAAF data would indicate that the advantages of some athletes \nwith DSD have had a significant effect on mid-distance track events, so it is inferred from this that the rule only applies to events from 400 m to a mile (which the regulations term \u201cRestricted Events\u201d). In international \ncompetition and outdoor track events, these events are: 400 m., 400 m \nhurdles, 800 m, 1500 m and one mile, alone or as part of a relay race or a combined trial.\nThe special eligibility requirements described apply only to \u201cRe -\nlevant Athletes\u201d in the female classification in a Restricted Event in International Competition.\nThe regulations describe as \u201cRelevant Athlete\u201d those who meet the \nfollowing three criteria:\n \u2212Women with one of the following DSDs:\n- D eficiency of 5\u03b1-reductase type 2.\n- P artial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS). or Deficiency of  \n17 \u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3) or Congenital adrenal \nhyperplasia or Deficiency of 3 \u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.\nOvotesticular DSD, or Another genetic disorder with impaired \ngonadal steroidogenesis.\n \u2212Has circulating blood testosterone levels of \u2265 5 nmol.L-1.\n \u2212Has sufficient sensitivity to androgens so that these testosterone \nlevels have an androgenizing effect.\nConditions for eligibility\n \u2212Being recognized by law as a woman or as intersexual (or equi -\nvalent).\n \u2212Reducing the rate of circulating blood testosterone to below 5nmol.L\n-1 for a continuous period of at least 6 months, using, for \nexample, contraceptives.\n \u2212Maintaining the circulating blood testosterone level below 5 nmol.L\n-1 continuously (in or outside competition) for as long as \nwished to maintain eligibility to compete in the female classifica -\ntion in Restricted Events in international competition (or setting a world record in a Restricted Event in a competition that is not an international contest).\nTaking part without suppressing high levels of \ntestosterone\nThe regulations allow women athletes who do not want to follow \nthe above guidelines to participate in the following circumstances:\n \u2212In the female classification: \n- I n any competition that is not an international competition.\n- I n international competitions: in any discipline other than track \nevents of between 400 m and one mile.\n \u2212In the men's classification: In any competition at any level, in any \ndiscipline, without restriction.\n \u2212In any 'intersex' classification (or similar) that the organizer of the event can offer in any competition at any level, in any discipline, \nwithout restriction.\nReasons given by the IAAF for implementing this rule\nThe arguments expressed by the IAAF in the text1, are as follows:\n \u2212To guarantee fair and valid competition in athletics within catego -\nries that create a level playing field and to guarantee that success Figure 2.

It does not \nwish to risk discouraging those aspirations by having conditions of unfair competition, which would deny female athletes a fair \nchance of succeeding.\n \u2212Because of the significant advantages in size, strength and power \nthat men generally possess over women from puberty, largely due \nto much higher levels of circulating testosterone in males, and \nthe impact these advantages may have on sport performance, it is generally accepted that competition between male and female \nathletes would not be fair and would risk discouraging women \nfrom participating in sport. Therefore, in addition to the separate competition categories based on age, the IAAF has also created \nseparate competition categories for male and female athletes.\nSports ethics arguments against the IAAF \nregulations\nWe must begin with the very concept of competitive sport as a \nhuman activity based on inequality between people. Competition \nattempts to measure precisely that inequality that is what gives rise to \nthe victory of some over others. Setting down rules that try to eliminate or reduce this inequality would transform athletic competition into \nsomething else.\nSports performance is an extremely complex phenotypic trait that in \nturn is influenced, although not determined, by many other traits, such as the distribution of muscle fibre type, aerobic power and capacity, \nstrength and anaerobic capacity, and the ability to train physical skills\n38. \nAlthough the extrinsic determinants of human athletic performance, \nsuch as training, nutrition, living conditions, etc., have an undoubted and \nsignificant impact on sports performance, the importance of extrinsic determinants must not be trivialized, among these the genetic ones. \nIt is clear that it is impossible to establish a single formula for anyone \nto become a sports champion and that quantifying the contribution of each of these determinants continues to be a challenge to research \nin sports science\n39-42.\nHowe ver, certain people who have not undergone scheduled \ntraining is already able to demonstrate extraordinarily high levels of \nphysical performance. Some people also show a better response to \ntraining and improve their performance much more than others. when \nfollowing the same working programme40,41.\nThe fact that genetics is a very significant intrinsic factor in athletic \nperformance is shown by the analysis of athlete rankings (year 2018 on 17 December) where it can be seen that, in the 1500 m, 14 of the 15 best \nall-time records were set by athletes born on the African continent, and \nthat the first 7 athletes in this trial in 2018 were born in Ethiopia, while \nonly one thrower with one of the top 60 world times (15 in each of the \nweight-lifting, discus, hammer and javelin trials) was born in Africa, and \nonly 4 in total (7%) had a phenotype for that continent.The IAAF intends to delimit a group of Restricted Events (400 m to \none mile) to apply this regulation, without stating any objective reason why this is done in these trials and not in other events. It should be \nborne in mind that, as has already been explained, there is no evidence \nthat high testosterone levels in women may be more advantageous in these trials than in others, and it has already been seen that in the jump \ndisciplines this advantage may be greater. In this way the IAAF would \nbe legislating in violation of the principle of generality by derogating a la carte and committing injustice towards a very specific population, \nalmost singling out specific female athletes.\nIn addition, it seems essential to consider that the artificial reduction \nof the advantage that nature has granted to certain women in the form of higher blood testosterone levels, could be somewhat random, since \nthere is no evidence of a direct relationship between the reduction in the rate of testosterone in female athletes, hyperandrogenism and the \nimpact on sports performance. Consequently, with the same decrease \nin blood testosterone, even taking this at the same level, this could affect the running speed to a different extent in one female athlete \nfrom another.\nAnd what happens in men who have circulating testosterone \nlevels higher than the reference values? In the 80s, the genetic basis \nof Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome began to be studied\n43, a basis that has \nbecome much better known over the last decades44-45. Today, numerous \nstudies are advancing in the description of a genetic load similar to the cases of female hyperandrogenism with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome \nand various types of male hyperandrogenism\n46-50. Why should not men \nwho could obtain good results in those Restricted events or any other \ntrial have applied to them regulations similar to those that the IAAF \nwants to apply to women? \nWe cannot conclude without taking into account the efforts that \nthe governments of the world and the sports movement have been \nmaking to eradicate the scourge of doping. As the World Anti-Doping \nCode says in justifying this effort in its Fundamentals:  \u201cAnti-doping \nprograms seek to preserve what is intrinsically valuable about sport. This intrinsic value is often referred to as \u201cthe spirit of sport. \u201d it is the essence of Olympism, the pursuit of human excellence through the dedicated perfection \nof each person\u2019s natural talents. It is how we play true. The spirit of sport is \nthe celebration of the human spirit, body and mind, and is reflected in values \nwe find in and through sport, \u2026 \u201d\nAs can be seen, natural talent is the excellence that is sought to \nbe preserved, so how can this fight be justified, if when these natural talents appear, the attempt is to eliminate them in an artificial way? That \nway we cannot defend fair play\n51.\nMedical ethics arguments against the IAAF regulations\nIf sports ethics arguments against these regulations seem overwhel-\nming evidence, medical arguments that are very clear and concise seem \nmuch more important - and any medical professional will undoubtedly \nunderstand these. \nThe rules of Medicine prohibit the use of medication that is not \ndestined to treat a disease or pathology. Moreover, medications must be used following the established indications and not for any other purposes. The use of medication outside these circumstances is con-Sport classification regulations for athletes with differences in sexual development (DSD)115\nArch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):109-116trary to medical practice and is therefore an offence on the part of the \nprescribing physician52.\nThese regulations, which aim to reduce performance in people who \nhave innate qualities of genetic origin and have not been obtained by illegal means, would undoubtedly apply in these cases, and doctors who prescribe treatments for this purpose could clearly be committing \nan offence.\nBut above all, it should be noted that in the mind of every doctor, \nin their relationship with their patients, the side effects, contraindi -\ncations and risks that prescribed medication could have should take \npride of place. It should not be forgotten that the drugs that affect the hormonal sphere of individuals involve significant health risks, risks that \nare accentuated exponentially if these drugs are used beyond their \nmedical indications\n53.\nFinally, it is necessary to add the problem that arises in cases like \nthese with respect to the protection of data and even individuals\u2019 rights. We are seeing women who, as a result of wanting to exercise their right to practice sports, find themselves involved in the maximum possible \ncirculation internationally of their tests results, examinations and me -\ndical diagnoses, to then be exhibited in the media at the same level as \ncheating athletes who use doping to excel in sports.\nConclusion\nFaced with these regulations that clearly fly in the face of unques -\ntionable evidence from the point of view of sportsmanship, against the \noath of medical practice, and even against the rights of individuals, we \ncan only demand their immediate repeal.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors do not declare a conflict of interest.\nBibliography\n 1.
