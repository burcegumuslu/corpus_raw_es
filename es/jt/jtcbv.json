Do not pipette the PBS directly onto the cells or you may detach them (e.g., HeLa or 293T cells)\n- Carefully remove PBS and add crystal violet solution (see at the end of the protocol for the recipe).\n|multiwell||Volume of Crystal violet solution to be added|\n|96||50 ul|\n|48||100 ul|\n|24||200 ul|\n|12||500 ml|\n|6||1 ml|\nNote: When adding the Crystal violet solution, place the tip of the tip on the edge of the multiwell and drop the solution, \u201csliding\u201d it on the edge. Do not pipette the solution directly onto the cells or you may detach them (e.g., HeLa or 293T cells)\n- Incubate 10 minutes at room temperature on an orbital shaker\n- Carefully remove crystal violet solution and wash 3 times with PBS (using the same volume specified in the first table)\n- Invert the multiwell on a napkin to drain all the liquid (the cells are fixed due to the presence of methanol in the crystal violet staining solution)\n- Add 1% SDS to solubilize the stain\n|multiwell||Volume of 1% SDS solution to be added|\n|96||200 ul|\n|48||500 ul|\n|24||1 ml|\n|12||2 ml|\n|6||3 ml|\nnote: these latter volumes are suitable for multiwells with epithelial cells at 70-80% confluence. It is necessary to fine-tune the volume to be used and perhaps combine it if the absorbance falls outside the linearity zone of the calibration line\n- Agitate multiwell on an orbital shaker for 60 minutes, until color is uniform with no areas of dense coloration in bottom of wells.\n- Read absorbence of each well at 570 nm\n- Subtract the average absorbance of the wells without cells from that of each well on the plate to subctract backgruound.\nThe absorbance of the wells without cells, but processed identically to wells with cells, defines the background\nof the staining method.\nCrystal

evaluate the values within which there is a linearity between the number of cells in the well and the absorbance of the crystal violet solubilized, it is necessary to prepare a multiwell containing serial dilutions of cells plated at a certain concentration, which must be adhered and grow and absorbance must be evaluated the next day.\nFor example, considering a 24 multiwell, you can plate 100000 or 160000 cells in the first column and then make a serial dilution (1:2) in the adjacent well\n|100000||50000||25000||12500||6250||3000|\n|100000||50000||25000||12500||6250||3000|\n|160000||80000||40000||20000||10000||5000|\n|160000||80000||40000||20000||10000||5000|\nat too high or too low concentrations there may be a deviation of linearity\nif this occurs, fewer cells will need to be plated or a larger (or smaller) volume of SDS will need to be used to solubilize the crystal
