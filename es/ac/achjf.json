In 1990, an international Commission addressed\nESMAP's role for the 1990s and, noting the vital role of adequate and affordable energy in\neconomic growth, concluded that the Programme should intensify its efforts to assist developing\ncountries to manage their energy sectors more effectively. The Commission also recommended that\nESMAP concentrate on making long-term efforts in a smaller number of countries. The\nCommission's report was endorsed at ESMAP's November 1990 Annual Meeting and prompted an\nextensive reorganization and reorientation of the Programme. Today, ESMAP is conducting Energy\nAssessments, performing preinvestment and prefeasibility work, and providing institutional and\npolicy advice in selected developing countries. Through these efforts, ESMAP aims to assist\ngovernments, donors, and potential investors in identifying, funding, and implementing economically\nand environmentally sound energy strategies.\nGOVERNANCE AND OPERATIONS\nESMAP is governed by a Consultative Group (ESMAP CG), composed of representatives of the\nUNDP and World Bank, the governments and institutions providing financial support, and\nrepresentatives of the recipients of ESMAP's assistance. The ESMAP CG is chaired by the World\nBank's Vice President, Finance and Private Sector Development, and advised by a Technical\nAdvisory Group (TAG) of independent energy experts that reviews the Programme's strategic\nagenda, its work program, and other issues. ESMAP is staffed by a cadre of engineers, energy\nplanners and economists from the Industry and Energy Department of the World Bank. The\nDirector of this Department is also the Manager of ESMAP, responsible for administering the\nProgramme.\nFUNDING\nESMAP is a cooperative effort supported by the World Bank, UNDP and other United Nations\nagencies, the European Community, Organization of American States (OAS), Latin American\nEnergy Organization (OLADE), and countries including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,\nGermany, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,\nPortugal, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nFor further information or copies of completed ESMAP reports, contact:\nESMAP\nc/o Industry and Energy Department\nThe World Bank\n1818 H Street N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20433\nU.S.A.\nECUADOR:\nEnergy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nAugust 1994\nThis Study was carried out between June and December 1992,\nmostly in Ecuador, by a group of national and international\nconsultants and World Bank/ESMAP staff.

The goal of this Study is to analyze how energy prices (those ruling until September\n1992) could be raised to cover their economic costs and what effect this would have on the\neconomy, on the level and structure of consumption, and on the welfare of (especially) low-\nincome consumers. The adjustments that were required are substantial, not gigantic but they\nwould still have important positive effects on public finances (on the fiscal deficit and its\nfinancing, thereby lowering inflation) and on economic efficiency (improvement in resource\nallocation). The price adjustments would cause modest increases in costs of production in\ngeneral and have some negative effects on the welfare (and on the budgets) of low-income\nconsumers (especially urban and rural low-income communities, women and children). The\neffect of higher prices on household budgets are being analyzed through a survey conducted in\nlate 1992, whose results are presented and analyzed in a companion report, to be issued in the\nnear future.\n2. Very little hard data were available about the energy consumption habits of low-income\nhouseholds in Ecuador, although studies in other Latin American countries could be considered\nbroadly representative. A recently completed joint OLADE/ESMAP report on energy pricing in\nLatin America concludes that the share of energy subsidies accruing to low-income consumers\nis typically small because the consumption of LPG, most petroleum products (except for\nkerosene) and electricity is highly correlated with incomes. A survey of energy consumption\n(national, urban, and rural) commissioned by ESMAP appears to support the above conclusion\nalso for Ecuador.\n3. Since this Study was initiated, the government of Ecuador made important changes in the\nprices of energy products (on September 4, 1992 and in May 1993) which have gone a long way\ntoward resolving the main issue analyzed in this report. While an effort has been made to clearly\nlabel \"prices\" as referring to either before or after the adjustment, this may not have been done\neverywhere. Generally, however, the context will make clear whether the \"prices\" referred to are\nthose before or after the adjustment. Electric power tariffs were adjusted a second time, in May\n1993.\n4. The government of Ecuador cooperated fully with the study team. The team wishes to\nthank the Ministry of Energy and Mines (especially the Subsecretariates for Hydrocarbons and\nElectrification) Petroecuador and its subsidiaries, INECEL and its main departments and INE, the\nNational Energy Institute. The team would also like to express its gratitude to the Government\nof Belgium who cofinanced this Study and to UNDP Quito for managing Study funds expended\nin Ecuador.\nii Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n5.

This report was written to assist the new Ecuadorean Government which took office on\nAugust 10, 1992, in taking urgent, important decisions with respect to energy pricing and energy\nsector reforms. Energy subsidies in Ecuador have been large, persistent and their social effect\nhad never been verified, although the main justification for low prices had always been that they\nhelped the poor. This subsidization policy has had a 20-year history; the first steps away from\nit were taken on September 4, 1992 with substantial price increases for oil products and\nelectricity.\n2. Low energy prices, and the concomitant subsidy (i.e. negative taxes), however, had an\nobvious impact on macroeconomic performance. In any given year, energy subsidies typically\nexceeded the Consolidated Public Sector Deficit (for example, in recent years, the Consolidated\nPublic Sector Deficit has varied between 1% and 4% of GDP; for 1991 the estimate of energy\nsubsidies exceeds US$600 million or about 6% of GDP). Without access to external savings\n(except through the incurring of arrears) and with difficult and costly internal borrowing, a maijor\nshare of the Consolidated Public Sector Deficit has historically been financed through monetary\nemission. These causes largely explain the stubborn rate of inflation, varying between 50% and\n80% p.a., that has existed during most of the last decade.\n3. The rationale behind this report's recommendation to essentially eliminate energy\nsubsidies is threefold:\n(a) The energy subsidies were, by and large, regressive (i.e., they helped the rich more than\nthe poor); data from a recent ESMAP study of power losses show the highly regressive\nnature of electric power subsidies (see paragraph 1.32); as for oil products, the results of\nsurvey that has been recently taken broadly support this statement.\n(b) The elimination of energy subsidies would go a long way toward reducing, if not\neliminating the, generally small, structural public sector deficit and its associated,\npersistent rate of inflation.\n(c) Efficiency gains, on both the demand and supply sides would accrue from the setting of\nenergy prices closer to economic costs. Furthermore, energy conservation would, in the\nshort run, allow exports to grow (and higher prices would discourage the heavy smuggling\nof refined products to Colombia and Peru) and, in the longer run, stretch out Ecuador's\ncrude oil reserves into the future. Environmental benefits would also be realized if less\nenergy were to be produced and consumed for any given growth rate and/or level of GDP.\niv Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nThe Incidence of Energy Subsidies\n4. Energy Consumption subsidies in 1991 are estimated at $624 million annually, with about\n$400 million on petroleum products and about $223 million on electric power. The total subsidy\nto power users was about US$223 million and the subsidy per connection per annum was\nUS$1,092 for residential consumers using 1000 kWh/month or more, versus US$21.6 for those\nusing less than 80 kWh/month. Mission calculations show that up until July of 1992 a major\nshare of electric power subsidies (US$68 million out of a total of US$128.2 million for all\nresidential users) accrued to middle- and high-income households. After the tariff increase of\nSeptember 1992, the total subsidy to power users was reduced to US$104.8 million per year, of\nwhich the lion's share (that is, 100%) went to residential users. As for petroleum, calculations\nmade for this report (see Chapter I, paragraphs 1-26.9 and Annex Tables 1-7) show that in 1991,\nthe subsidy to internal consumption of petroleum derivatives was estimated at about US$400\nmillion, equivalent to 4% of GDP, about equal to the total public sector deficit for that year.\nAfter the September pricing measures, the subsidy was eliminated in global terms (average\ninternal, tax-inclusive prices now exceed the CIF values) and although a substantial subsidy\nremains on LPG and kerosene, it is more than offset by surpluses on other products, notably\ngasolines. As for the social impact, studies in neighboring countries show that, except for\nkerosene, subsidies correlate strongly with income and are thus regressive. A survey of energy\nconsumption was commissioned to obtain empirical data on the consumption of energy\n(especially modern fuels) by Ecuador's poor households. The survey is almost complete, and its\npreliminary results confirm those obtained in neighboring countries. The full results of the\nsurvey are presented in a companion Report to be issued shortly.\nNew Pricing Measures\n5. With the new pricing measures enacted in September 1992, subsidies on oil consumption\nas a whole were eliminated and a surplus of US$3.4 million has emerged (only LPG, fuel oil and\nkerosene consumption are receiving a cross subsidy of about US$90 million, US $3.3 million and\nUS $5.1 million respectively,' financed from higher prices of gasoline). While the measures taken\nrepresent a substantial step in the right direction, much still remains to be done. With the further\ngasoline price increase of February 1994 and the recent decline in world oil prices, average\ninternal oil prices are now above the former. In power, the structure of tariffs needs to be\nchanged to reflect the cost of service to different users, although the level of tariffs after the\nSeptember 92 measures is close to 75% of LRMC. After the adjustment of May 93, tariffs are\nclose to LRMC but their structure is not. This Report strongly recommends the implementation\nof the tariff system proposed in the recently completed Bank-financed tariff study. While this\n' It should be noted that these magnitudes are only approximations as there are no\nreally accurate data on internal marketing costs. Furthermore, these magnitudes are\nchanging daily (i.e. the surplus is being reduced) pari-passu with the depreciation of the\nSucre and the variation in world prices of oil and oil derivatives.\nExecutive Summary v\nreport suggests some methodological improvements (see Annexes I, II and III), they represent\nrefinements but do not imply that the implementation of the new tariff methodology should be\ndelayed. In the case of petroleum products, the average price is now above the opportunity costs\n(US$0.63/gallon versus US$0.57/gallon CIF value plus internal marketing costs) but the problem\nof household fuels has not been well thought out, especially in relation to the problems of low-\nincome households. While the new price for LPG cut the subsidy, the fact that low-income\nconsumers are still being encouraged to use LPG (rather than kerosene) suggests that the\ngovernment will not eliminate the remaining subsidy to LPG. This Report recommends the\nfreeing of trade in kerosene to eliminate the monopolization from which it has suffered under the\nso-called \"Plan Bandera\" of restricted sales. As documented in Chapter IV and Annex 5 on the\nmarketing of kerosene, almost none of the subsidy on kerosene reached poor consumers. This\nreport recommends the open sale of kerosene at a reasonable discount from diesel (not with the\nhuge differential that currently exists viz. S/60 per gallon for kerosene versus S/1460 per gallon\nfor diesels 1 and 2) and facilitating the supply of efficient kerosene stoves at the lowest possible\nprices.\n6. This Report further suggests some specific measures to correct the few remaining\naberrations in energy pricing. First, with respect to electric power, there is, at present, no\naccepted system of raising tariffs; they have been fixed at the level set in September 1992,and\nadjusted again in May 1993. A socially-inspired, life-line tariff for residential users could be\njustified but it should:\n(a) apply only to those consumers who use less than the life-line quantity, say, 50 kWh per\nmonth (and not to the first 200 kWh of all residential users as has been the practice until\nrecently); the average low income household uses less than 50 kWh/month;\n(b) be set as a percentage of the cost of service to those consumers, say, 50% so that t h e\nsubsidy should not get out of hand and the price become so low that the costs of billing\nand collection exceed the sale revenue for these consumers; as has been the case until\nApril 93; and\n(c) that this subsidy be financed directly from the State Budget or, less theoretically\njustifiable, through charging wealthier consumers slightly more than their specific cost\nof service.\nThese measures are all consistent with the adoption of the new tariff methodology,\nnamely, the establishment of a tariff structure that reflects costs of serving each category of\nconsumers.\n7. Second, with respect to hydrocarbons, the government should prepare a plan to raise the\nprice of LPG to its economic cost over a reasonable period of time. The economic cost of LPG\napproximates the current import and internal handling and distribution costs. Alternatively, the\naverage financial cost of supply (import plus domestic production) could be used as a price\nsetting guide. This financial cost is of the order of about US $200/ton (rather than about US$\nvi Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n260-300/ton import cost plus about US $100/ton for internal distribution costs which is currently\nconsidered the economic cost) and would thus require approximately doubling the September 92\nprice as opposed to a near tripling to reach economic costs. Sold at financial cost, LPG would\ncontinue to have an economic subsidy, but not a financial one.\n8. This Report further proposes that kerosene be chosen as the fuel for poorer households,\nespecially those in suburban areas who do not have access to traditional fuels (which will\ncontinue being important in rural areas). Before kerosene can play this role, however, its\nmarketing must be freed and its price must be raised to within a reasonable margin of those of\nDiesels 2 and 1 (which is really kerosene sold for industrial use). The current official price of\nS/.60 per gallon is merely the first in a chain of prices that reach to the final consumer. The\nfinal consumer price, especially in small quantities and in rural areas exceeds the price of its\nsubstitute (Diesel 1 at S/1460 per gallon). When domestic kerosene is cornered and sold in larger\nquantities for industrial use, the upper limit of the price is set by Diesel 1. So, under the current\nsystem, virtually none of the State's foregone revenue (S/1460 -60 = 1400/gallon) benefits low\nincome consumers but some does accrue to industrial users. It is obvious that both prices should\nbe increased simultaneously after measures are taken to improve the supply of more efficient\nkerosene stoves. Kerosene stopped being distributed for residential use in June 1993, or rather\nit stopped being sold at s/60/gallon. Furthermore, the supply of so-called \"regular\" gasoline\ncould be discontinued as there are only a few hundred users in Cuenca (and they should be\ncompensated, possibly, with the gift of kerosene stoves to replace their gasoline burners).\n9. Finally, the additional revenues due to higher energy prices could be enough to practically\neliminate the fiscal deficit and allow an increase in social expenditures to compensate poor\nconsumers. This would be so, provided that the price level and the exchange rate stabilize. If\nprices continue to rise (meaning that additional revenues are not assigned to cutting the deficit\nbut cause higher expenditures) then another round of price increases will be inevitable to\nmaintain real prices at their September level (although some selective price increases were still\nneeded, over and above September prices, e.g., for LPG, kerosene and residential electricity\nsupply). Fortunately, however, inflation seems to be slowing and this would help in keeping real\noil prices constant, without having to raise nominal prices too often.\nMedium-Term Sectoral Issues\n10. Petroleum Reserves and Production: At present (late 1992), total proven crude petroleum\nreserves are estimated at nearly 2 billion barrels (or about 17 years at the current rate of\nproduction) of which approximately 1.5 billion are of light crudes (API of 290) and the rest, of\nheavy crudes (API of 150 to 200). These reserve figures are higher than the official figures\npublished by the National Directorate for Hydrocarbons, but lower than figures used by\nPetroecuador and the private oil companies. Similarly, the potential for increasing current output\nin the short run is the object of intense debate, with the private oil companies again being the\nmost optimistic, claiming that output could be raised by 100,000 b/d, largely in the fields\nproduced by Petroamazonas. This report suggests the truth may lie somewhere between the\nmiddle and high scenarios reported in the text (see below Annex Tables 18-20). In this case,\nExecutive Summary vii\noutput would peak in 1996 at about 400,000 b/d but this would be highly dependent on massive\ninvestments (of the order of US$1.2 billion) by the private oil companies over 1992-95, as well\nas in the fields now operated by Petroecuador. Whether this investment is from public or private\nsources will depend on what happens to Petroecuador who is just entering the study phase of a\nprivatization process. Since the public sector has neither the resources nor the enthousiasm (or\nthe will) to commit itself to such high levels of expenditures, and the private sector is no longer\nexcited about prospects, given the poor quality of recent discoveries and low crude prices,\ninvestment will most probably lag.\n11. No exploration contracts were signed during the Borja Government (1988-92) and this\nneeds to be remedied to prevent a steep decline in oil reserves, especially if current output is to\nrise significantly. This report suggests simplifying the exploration legislation (possibly by\nmoving toward Production Sharing, concessions or direct negotiations), and opening up to foreign\noil companies areas reserved for Petroecuador. In addition, discriminatory taxation of foreign\noil companies needs to be eliminated -this measure has the support of the new government's\nenergy-policy makers. On the other hand, the huge enhanced recovery project proposed for the\nPetroamazonas fields seems no longer justified, and primary and secondary recovery methods are\nsufficient, for the time being, to recover almost as large a share of in situ oil than with the vastly\nmore expensive tertiary methods. At the time of this writing, the seventh round of oil exploration\nnegotiations was just setting under way (Dec 93).\n12. In downstream activities, present refining, storage and pipeline capacities appear sufficient\nfor the short to medium term. Except for minor increases in crude oil storage and pipeline\ncapacity (including use of the crude pipeline spur through Colombia) the only other investment\nthat could be justified is a minor capacity increase in the Esmeraldas refinery, and, possibly\ninvestments at Balao to allow larger crude carriers to operate. Given the more correct pricing\npolicies introduced recently, forecast growth in domestic demand for oil products will probably\nslow (and smuggling has already started to decline) and so, the need for additional refining\ncapacity may well be postponed. Therefore, the idea of building a new grass-roots refinery in\nthe Peninsula (with public funds) is an unnecessary, risky gamble that fortunately, the\ngovernment chose to abandon.\n13. Also, none of the major refinery development schemes based on refining heavier crude\nshould be seriously considered at present. The supply of light Oriente Crude that can be refined\nat Esmeraldas will, for many years, exceed domestic demand while the output of heavy crudes\nwill most likely remain below 50,000 b/d until the end of the century. It would seem imprudent\nto commit Ecuador to refinery investments exceeding US$1 billion when there is no pressing\nneed to do so. Some efficiency gains, however, could be achieved by closing the refineries of\nthe Peninsula while upgrading the Esmeraldas and, possibly, Amazonas refineries.\nviii Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nElectric Power\n14. The financial crisis in the electric power subsector has been caused mostly by the lackof a forward-looking tariff policy. This problem was masked in the late 1970's and early 1980'sby large transfers of oil resources, which paid for major power investments over the last decade.This crisis has led to delays (of several years) in investments so that the system has no back-upcapacity for meeting incremental demand (although demand growth may slow because of therecent tariff increase) and may face severe capacity and energy constraints immediately and forthe medium term, both in terms of generation and transmission. Dry season energy constraintsare getting worse because the planning system has been biased in favor of hydroelectric solutionsbut the thermal support plants that were required were never built. As a result, Ecuador now hasto scramble to build gas turbines which may or may not be least cost, to meet demand over thecoming several years. In addition, the expansion plan calls for further investment on the Pauteriver, where 90% of Ecuador's hydroelectric capacity is located and the technical feasibility ofbuilding Paute Mazar has not yet been firmly established. While not much can be gained in theshort and medium term by reviewing the generation expansion plan, in the longer run, such areview could help correct any potential flaw in the program, and should definitely be carried out,together with a general strengthening of the planning process to give greater weight to economicvariables, risk and the environment.\nElectric Power Subsector Reforms\n15. Given the rather poor performance of the electric power subsector, this Study suggests thatmajor reforms are in order. These reforms should deal with the regulatory framework, tariffpolicies and institutional reorganization. This report suggests that the new regulatory agency(possibly for the energy sector as a whole)2would need to be independent of the politicalprocess (as much as possible) yet have access to the highest levels of government and betechnically excellent, so as to carry immediate credibility with sector authorities and operatingfirms. INECEL should be shorn of its regulatory prerogatives, concentrate on generation andtransmission (i.e. become a true enterprise), shed some excess manpower (especially in theEngineering and Projects, and Distribution and Marketing Departments) and cut lose theelectricity distribution companies (which could be easily privatized as they have the legal formsof limited liability companies). Whether private or publicly owned, INECEL would benefit fromcompetition from private independent generators. An in-depth study of tariff policies has recentlybeen completed by INECEL with Bank funding and this report recommends its speedyimplementation. Since a study, proposed to be financed under an ongoing Bank project willconsider regulatory aspects and institutional reforms, this report only treats these matters in a\n2 The regulator would only set oil prices on the basis of world market prices, during thetransition to a full, free market for oil, i.e. the regulator would have simply the power ofobserving and gathering information about domestic oil market behavior to help establish andthen maintain a free and open market.\nExecutive Summary ix\ngeneral manner, suggesting a broad framework of actions that need to be taken whatever the\nprecise manner in which Ecuador ultimately decides to reform its power subsector. Similarly,\na study should be undertaken to set up a pricing and taxation structure for petroleum derivatives\nthat would allow the deregulation of the hydrocarbons subsector and the introduction of\ncompetition, especially in downstream operations.\nx\nINTRODUCCION\n1. El objetivo de este Estudio es analizar c6mo los precios de la energia (aquellos\nvigentes hasta septiembre de 1992) podrian ser incrementadog para cubrir sus costos\necon6micos y que efecto esto tendria en la economia, sobre el nivel y la estructura del\nconsumo, y en el bienestar de (especialmente) los consumidores de bajos ingresos. Los\najustes que se requieren son sustanciales, no gigantescos pero sin embargo tendrian\nefectos positivos importantes en las finanzas publicas (en el deficit fiscal y su\nfinanciaci6n, disminuyendo de ese modo la inflaci6n) y en la eficiencia econ6mica\n(mejora en la asignaci6n de recursos). El ajuste de los precios causaria en general\nmodestos aumentos en los costos de producci6n y tendria algunos efectos negativos en el\nbienestar (y en los presupuestos) de los consumidores de bajos ingresos (especialmente en\nlas comunidades urbanas y rurales de bajos ingresos, mujeres y ninios). El efecto de\nprecios mas altos en los presupuestos de las familias esta siendo analizado a traves de una\nencuesta llevada a cabo a finales de 1992, cuyos resultados son presentados y analizados\nen un informe separado, que sera publicado en un futuro cercano.\n2. Muy pocos datos concretos eran disponibles acerca de los habitos de consumo de\nenergia de las familias de bajos ingresos en el Ecuador, aunque estudios hechos en otros\npaises latinoamericanos podrian ser considerados a grosso modo representativos. Un\ninforme recientemente publicado, elaborado conjuntamente entre OLADE y ESMAP\nacerca del precio de la energia en Latino America concluye que la porci6n de los\nsubsidios a la energia que efectivamente reciben los consumidores de bajos-ingresos es\ntipicamente pequefia debido a que el consumo de GLP, de la mayor parte de los productos\nderivados del petr6leo (excepto el querosen) y de la electricidad esta altamente\ncorrelacionado con los ingresos. Una encuesta sobre el consumo de energia (nacional,\nurbano y rural) encargada por ESMAP parece apoyar la conclusi6n anterior tambien para\nel Ecuador.\n3. Desde que este Estudio se inici6, el gobierno del Ecuador hiz6 importantes\ncambios en los precios de los productos de la energia (el 4 de septiembre de 1992 y en\nmayo de 1993) que han contribuido sustancialmente a resolver la cuestion principal\nanalizada en este informe. Aunque se ha hecho un esfuerzo para designar claramente los\n\"precios\" como antes o despues del ajuste, puede haber casos en que esta designaci6n no\naparezca. Generalmente, sin embargo, el contexto aclarara si los \"precios\" referidos son\naquellos antes o despues del ajuste. Las tarifas de energia electrica fueron ajustadas una\nsegunda vez, en mayo de 1993.\n4. El gobiemo del Ecuador cooper6 ampliamente con el equipo de estudio.

Este informe fue escrito para ayudar al nuevo Gobiemo Ecuatoriano, el cual se\nposesion6 el 10 de Agosto de 1992, en la toma de decisiones urgentes e importantes con\nrespecto al precio de la energia y las reformas del sector de la energia. Los subsidios a la\nenergia en el Ecuador han sido grandes, persistentes y su efecto social nunca habia sido\nverificado, a pesar de que la principal justificaci6n a los precios bajos siempre habia sido\nque ellos ayudaban a los pobres. Esta politica de subsidios ha tenido una historia de 20\nafios; mas los primeros pasos apartandose de ella fueron dados el 4 de septiembre de 1992\ncon unos aumentos sustanciales en los precios de los derivados del petr6leo y de la\nelectricidad.\n2. El precio bajo de la energia, y el subsidio concomitante (ej. impuestos negativos),\nsin embargo, tuvo un impacto evidente en el desempefio macroecon6mico. En cualquier\nafno dado los subsidios a la energia tipicamente excedieron el Deficit Consolidado del\nSector Puiblico (por ejemplo, en afios recientes, el Deficit Consolidado del Sector Piublico\nha variado entre el 1% y 4% del PIB; para 1991 el estimativo de los subsidios a la energia\nexcede los US$600 millones o cerca del 6% del PIB). Sin acceso a ahorros externos\n(excepto a traves de atrasos en el pago de la deuda) y con dificil y costoso credito interno,\nuna gran proporci6n del Deficit Consolidado del Sector Puiblico ha sido financiado\nhist6ricamente a traves de la emisi6n monetaria. Estas causas explican ampliamente la\ntasa de inflaci6n persistente, que varia entre un 50% y 80% al aflo, y que ha existido\ndurante casi toda la uiltima decada.\n3. El raciocinio tras la recomendaci6n de este informe, de esencialmente eliminar los\nsubsidios a la energia, es triple:\n(a) Los subsidios a la energia fueron, de una manera general, regresivos (ej.\nellos ayudaron mas a los ricos que a los pobres); datos de un estudio\nreciente de ESMAP sobre perdidas electricas muestran la naturaleza\naltamente regresiva de los subsidios a la energia electrica (ver parrafo\n1.32); para los productos derivados del petr6leo, los resultados de una\nencuesta que se hizo recientemente apoyan ampliamente esta afirmaci6n.\n(b) La eliminaci6n de los subsidios a la energia iria muy lejos hacia la\nreducci6n, sino a la eliminaci6n, del pequeflo deficit estructural del sector\npuiblico y la persistente tasa de inflaci6n asociada a este.\n(c) Se aumentaria la eficiencia,tanto en la demanda como en la oferta al fijar\nlos precios de la energia a un nivel mas cercano de sus costos econ6micos.\nAdemas, a corto plazo, la conservaci6n de energia permitiria el\ncrecimiento de las exportaciones (y precios mas altos desalentarfan el\nimportante contrabando de productos refinados hacia Colombia y Peru), y\na largo plazo, extenderia las reservas de petr6leo crudo del Ecuador hacia\nel futuro. Tambien habrian beneficios ambientales si menos energia fuera\nxiii\nproducida y consumida para cualquier tasa de crecimiento y/o nivel del\nPIB.\nLa Incidencia de los Subsidios a la Electricidad\n4. Calculos hechos por la Misi6n muestran que hasta julio de 1992 una gran\nproporci6n de los subsidios a la electricidad (US$68 millones sobre un total de US$128.2\nmillones para todos los usuarios residenciales) se otorg6 a familias de mediano y alto\ningreso. El subsidio total para los usuarios de electricidad fue de cerca de US$223\nmillones y el subsidio por conexi6n al afno fue de US$ 1.092 para consumidores\nresidenciales que usaran 1.000 kW h/mes o mas, versus US$21.60 para aquellos que\nusaran menos de 80 kW h/mes. Despues del aumento de las tarifas de septiembre de\n1992, el subsidio total para los usuarios baj6 a US$104.8 millones por afio, de los cuales\nla casi totalidad fue para los usuarios residenciales. En cuanto al petr6leo, calculos hechos\npara este informe (ver capitulo I, pirrafos 1-26.9 y cuadros Anexos 1-7) muestran que en\n1991, el subsidio al consumo interno de productos derivados del petr6leo fue estimado en\ncerca de US$400 millones equivalente al 4% del PIB, casi igual al deficit total del sector\npublico de ese afio. Despues de las medidas de precios adoptadas en septiembre, el\nsubsidio fue eliminado en terminos globales (precios intemos promedio, incluyendo\nimpuestos, ahora exceden los valores CIF) y aunque un subsidio sustancial permanece\npara el GLP y el querosen, es mas que contrabalanceado por el superavit en otros\nproductos, particularmente las gasolinas. En cuanto al impacto social, estudios hechos en\npaises vecinos muestran que, excepto por el querosen, los subsidios se correlacionan\nfuertemente con el ingreso y son por lo tanto regresivos. Una encuesta fue encargada para\nobtener datos empiricos sobre el consumo de energia (especialmente combustibles\nmodemos) por familias pobres del Ecuador. El estudio esta casi completo, y sus\nresultados preliminares confirman aquellos obtenidos en paises vecinos. La totalidad de\nlos resultados del estudio se da a conocer en un Informe complementario que sera emitido\nen breve.\nNuevas Medidas de Precios\n5. Con las nuevas medidas de precios tomadas en septiembre de 1992, los subsidios\nal consumo del petr6leo en conjunto fueron eliminados, y un excedente de US$3.4\nmillones ha surgido (s6lo el consumo de GLP, el combustible residual y el querosen estan\nrecibiendo un subsidio cruzado de cerca de US$90 millones, US$3.3 millones y US$5.1\nmillones respectivamente,' financiado por los precios mas altos de la gasolina). Mientras\nque las medidas tomadas representan un paso sustancial en la direcci6n correcta, todavia\nqueda mucho por hacer. Con el aumento adicional en el precio de la gasolina en febrero\n1 Debe observarse que estas magnitudes son s6lo aproximaciones al no haber realmente\ndatos exactos sobre los costos del mercadeo intemo. Ademas, estas magnitudes estan\ncambiando diariamente (ej. el excedente esta siendo reducido) a paso con la depreciaci6n\ndel Sucre y la variaci6n en los precios mundiales del petr6leo y los derivados del\npetr6leo.\nxiv\nde 1994 y el reciente descenso de los precios mundiales del petr6leo, el promedio intemo\nde los precios del petr6leo esta ahora por encima del primero. En electricidad, la\nestructura de las tarifas debe ser cambiada para reflejar el costo del servicio a los\ndiferentes usuarios, aunque el nivel de las tarifas despues de las medidas tomadas en\nseptiembre de 1992 esta cerca del 75% de los CMLP. Despues de los ajustes de mayo de\n1993, las tarifas estan cerca de los CMLP pero no su estructura. Este Informe recomienda\nfirmemente la puesta en practica del sistema de tarifas propuesto en el estudio sobre\ntarifas recientemente acabado con fondos del Banco .Mientras que este informe sugiere\nalgunas mejoras metodol6gicas (ver Anexos I, II y III), ellas representan refinamientos\npero no implican que la implementaci6n de la nueva metodologia de tarifas debera ser\naplazada. En el caso de los derivados del petr6leo, el precio promedio esta ahora por\nencima de los costos de oportunidad (US$0.63/gal6n versus US$0.57/gal6n valor CIF\nmas costo intemo de mercadeo) pero el problema de los combustibles de uso dometico no\nha sido bien solucionado, especialmente en relaci6n con los problemas de las familias de\nbajos ingresos. Mientras que el nuevo precio del GLP cort6 el subsidio, el hecho de que\nlos consumidores de bajos ingresos siguen siendo estimulados a usar el GLP (en lugar del\nquerosen) sugiere que el gobierno no eliminara el subsidio restante al GLP. Este Informe\nrecomienda la liberalizaci6n del comercio del querosen para eliminar la monopolizaci6n\nde la cual ha sufrido bajo el Ilamado \"Plan Bandera\" de ventas restringidas. Como ha sido\ndocumentado en el Capitulo IV y Anexo 5, en el mercadeo del querosen, casi nada del\nsubsidio al queros6n llega a los consumidores pobres. Este informe recomienda la venta\nabierta del querosen a un descuento razonable del diesel (no con el inmenso diferencial\nque actualmente existe, a saber S/60 por gal6n de querosen versus S/1460 por gal6n de\nlos diesels 1 y 2) y la facilitaci6n del abastecimiento de estufas eficientes de querosen a\nlos precios mas bajos posibles.\n6. Este Informe ademas sugiere algunas medidas especificas para corregir las pocas\naberraciones que quedan en el precio de la energia. Primero, con relaci6n a la energia\nelectrica, no hay actualmente un sistema aceptado para el aumento de tarifas; ellas han\nsido fijadas al nivel determinado en septiembre de 1992, y ajustadas una vez mAs en\nmayo de 1993. Una tarifa socialmente-inspirada, \"life-line\" para usuarios residenciales se\npodriajustificar, pero deberia:\n(a) aplicarse s6lo a aquellos consumidores que usen menos de la cantidad\n\"life-line\", por ejemplo, 50 kWh por mes (y na a los primeros 200 kWh\npara IQdo los usuarios residenciales como ha sido la prictica hasta\nrecientemente); el promedio de las familias de bajos ingresos usa menos\nde 50 kWh/mes;\n(b) fijarse como un porcentaje del costo del servicio a aquellos\nconsumidores, por ejemplo, 50%, para que el subsidio no se vuelva\ninmanejable y el precio baje tanto que los costos de facturaci6n y\ncobranza excedan los ingresos por ventas a estos consumidores; como ha\nsido el caso hasta abril de 1993; y\nxv\n(c) que este subsidio sea directamente financiado por el Presupuesto del\nEstado o, menos justificable te6ricamente, mediante el cobro a los\nconsumidores mas adinerados ligeramente mas que el costo especifico de\nservirlos.\nTodas estas medidas son consistentes con la adopci6n de la nueva metodologia de\ntarificaci6n, es decir, el establecimiento de una estructura de tarifas que refleje los costos\ndel servicio de cada categoria de usuarios.\n7. Segundo, con relaci6n a los hidrocarburos, el gobiemo debera preparar un plan\npara aumentar el precio del GLP a su costo econ6mico en un periodo razonable de\ntiempo. El costo econ6mico del GLP se aproxima a los costos presentes de importaci6n,\nmanejo intemo y distribuci6n. Alternativamente, el promedio de los costos financieros de\nsuministro (importaci6n mas producci6n domestica) podria ser usado como guia para\nestablecer un precio. Este costo financiero esta por el orden de US $200/ton (en vez de\nUS $260-300/ton por costo de importaci6n mas US $100/ton por costo de distribuci6n\ninterna el cual es actualmente considerado el costo econ6mico) y por lo tanto requerira\nduplicar aproximadamente el precio de septiembre de 1992 en vez de casi triplicarlo para\nalcanzar su costo econ6mico. Vendido al costo financiero, el GLP continuara teniendo un\nsubsidio econ6mico, mas no uno financiero.\n8. Este Informe ademas propone que el querosen sea escogido como el combustible\npara las fanilias mas pobres, especialmente aquellas en las areas suburbanas donde no se\ntiene acceso a los combustibles tradicionales (que continuaran siendo importantes en las\nareas rurales). Sin embargo, antes de que el querosen pueda desempefiar este rol, su\ncomercio debera ser liberalizado y su precio aumentado hasta liegar a un nivel razonable\nen relaci6n con el precio del Diesel 2 y I (que es realmente querosen vendido para uso\nindustrial). El actual precio oficial de S/.60 por gal6n es tan s6lo el primero en la cadena\nde precios que liega al consumidor final. El precio final al consumidor, especialmente en\npequefias cantidades y en areas rurales excede al precio de su sustituto (Diesel 1 a S/1460\npor gal6n). Cuando el querosen domestico es arrinconado y vendido en grandes\ncantidades para uso industrial, el limite superio del precio es establecido en base al\nDiesel 1. Por lo tanto, bajo el sistema actual, virtualmente ninguno de los ingresos no\npercibidos por el Estado (S/1460 -60 = 1400/gal6n de lucro cesante) beneficia a los\nconsumidores de bajos ingresos pero si a usuarios industriales. Es obvio que ambos\nprecios deberian ser aumentados simultaneamente despues de que sean tomadas las\nmedidas para mejorar el suministro de estufas mas eficientes de querosen .El querosen\ndej6 de ser distribuido para uso residencial en junio de 1993, o mas bien dej6 de ser\nvendido a S/60 por gal6n. Adicionalmente, el abastecimiento de la Ilamada gasolina\n\"regular\" podria ser eliminado ya que hay s6lo unos pocos cientos de usuarios en Cuenca\n(y ellos deberian ser compensados, posiblemente ,con la donaci6n de estufas de querosen\npara reemplazar los quemadores de gasolina).\n9. Finalmente, los ingresos adicionales provenientes de los precios mas altos de la\nenergia podrian ser suficientes para eliminar practicamente el deficit fiscal y permitir un\nxvi\naumento en gastos sociales para compensar a los consumidores pobres. Esto podria ser,\ncon tal de que el nivel del precio y la tasa de cambio se estabilicen. Si los precios\ncontinuaran subiendo (o sea, que los ingresos adicionales no corten el deficit sino\naumenten los gastos) entonces otra ronda de aumento de precios sera inevitable para\nmantener los precios reales al nivel de septiembre, (aunque algunos aumentos selectivos\nde precios fueran todavia necesitados, por encima de los precios de septiembre ej., para el\nabastecimiento de GLP, querosen y electricidad para uso residencial). Afortunadamente,\nsin embargo, la inflaci6n parece estar disminuyendo y esto ayudaria a mantener los\nprecios reales del petr6leo constantes, sin tener que aumentar los precios nominales\nfrecuentemente.\nAsuntos sectoriales de mediano plazo\n10. Reservas Petroleras y Producci6n: En la actualidad (finales de 1992) el total de\nreservas probadas de petr6leo crudo esta estimado en cerca de 2 mil millones de barriles\n(o alrededor de 17 afios a la presente tasa de producci6n) de los cuales aproximadamente\n1.500 millones son de crudos ligeros (API de 290) y el resto, de crudos pesados (API de\n15'a 200). Estas cifras de las reservas son mas altas que las oficiales publicadas por la\nDirecci6n Nacional de Hidrocarburos, pero mas bajas que las usadas por Petroecuador y\nlas compafnias petroleras privadas. Igualmente, el potencial para incrementar la actual\nproducci6n a corto plazo es objeto de un intenso debate, siendo las compafnias petroleras\nprivadas una vez mas las mas optimistas, sosteniendo que la producci6n podria ser\naumentada de 100.000 barriles/dia, principalmente en los campos de producci6n de\nPetroamazonas. Este informe sugiere que la verdad se ubique en algun lugar entre la\nsituaci6n media y alta reportadas en el texto (ver mas adelante Cuadros Anexos 18-20).\nEn este caso, la producci6n Ilegaria a su maximo en 1996 con cerca de 400.000 b/d pero\nesto dependeria de inversiones masivas (del orden de US$1.200 millones) por las\ncompaniias petroleras privadas durante 1992-95, asi como en los campos operados por\nPetroecuador. Que esta inversi6n provenga de una fuente puiblica o privada dependera de\nlo que suceda con Petroecuador, quien esta entrando en la fase de estudio del proceso de\nreestructuraci6n. Ya que el sector publico no tiene ni los recursos ni el entusiasmo (o el\ndeseo) en comprometerse en tan alto nivel de gastos, y el sector privado no estA\nentusiasmado con las perspectivas, dada la baja calidad de los recientes hallazgos y los\nbajos precios del crudo, la inversi6n probablemente se retrasara.\n11. Durante el Gobierno del Dr. Borja (1988-92) no se firmaron contratos de\nexploraci6n lo cual necesita ser remediado para evitar un descenso precipitado en las\nreservas de petr6leo, especialmente si la producci6n actual aumentara significativamente.\nEste informe sugiere la simplificaci6n de la legislaci6n de exploraci6n (posiblemente\nmoviendose hacia acuerdos de producci6n compartida/ \"production sharing agreements,\"\nconcesiones o negociaciones directas), y hacer accesible a compafias extranjeras de\npetr6leo areas reservadas para Petroecuador. Fuera de esto, la tributaci6n discriminadora\nde las companlias extranjeras de petr6leo debe ser eliminada -esta medida tiene el apoyo\nxvii\nde los responsables de la politica energetica del nuevo gobiemo.2 Por otro lado, el\ninmenso proyecto de recuperaci6n mejorada propuesto para los campos de\nPetroamazonas parece no justificarse mas, y los metodos de recuperacion primaria y\nsecundaria son suficientes, por el momento, para recuperar una proporci6n de petr6leo in\nsitu casi tan grande como con los metodos terciarios sustancialmente mas caros. En el\nmomento en que se escribi6 esto, la septima ronda de negociaciones de exploraci6n de\npetr6leo estaba empezando. (diciembre de 1993)\n12. En actividades posteriores a la extracci6n (downstream), la presente capacidad de\nrefinaci6n, almacenamiento y oleoductos parece suficiente para el corto y mediano plazo.\nExcepto por aumentos menores en el almacenamiento de petr6leo crudo y en la capacidad\nde los oleoductos (incluyendo el uso del ramal del oleoducto de Colombia) la unica otra\ninversi6n que podria ser justificada es un aumento menor en la capacidad de la refineria\nde Esmeraldas, y, posibles inversiones en Balao que permitan la operaci6n de tanqueros\nde crudo mas grandes. Dadas las politicas de precios mas correctas introducidas\nrecientemente, el pron6stico de crecimiento en la demanda domestica de los derivados del\npetr6leo probablemente disminuira (y el contrabando ya ha comenzado a descender), por\nlo tanto, la necesidad de capacidad adicional para refinaci6n bien puede ser postergada.\nPor lo tanto, la idea de construir una refineria completamente nueva en la Peninsula (con\nfondos puiblicos) es unajugada innecesaria y arriesgada que afortunadamente, el gobiemo\nresolvi6 abandonar.\n13. Igualmente, ninguno de los esquemas de desarrollo refinero basados en la\nrefinaci6n de crudos pesados deberia considerarse seriamente en la actualidad. El\nabastecimiento de crudo liviano de Oriente que puede ser refinado en Esmeraldas, por\nmuchos afios, excedera la demanda domestica mientras que la producci6n de crudos\npesados muy posiblemente permanecera por debajo de los 50.000 b/d hasta el final del\nsiglo. Pareceria imprudente comprometer al Ecuador en inversiones de refineria que\nexcedan los US$1.000 millones cuando no hay una necesidad apremiante para hacerlo.\nSin embargo, algunas mejoras en eficiencia, podrian lograrse cerrando las refinerias de la\nPeninsula y mejorando a la vez las refinerias de Esmeraldas y, posiblemente, Amazonas.\nEnergia Electrica\n14. La crisis financiera en el subsector de la energia electrica ha sido causada\nprincipalmente por la falta de una politica tarifaria con miras al futuro. Este problema fue\nencubierto a finales de los 70 y principios de los 80 por amplias transferencias de\nrecursos del petr6leo, que pagaron por las grandes inversiones electricas en la decada\npasada. La crisis ha llevado a demoras (de varios afios) en las inversiones, por lo tanto el\nsistema no tiene una capacidad que cubra la demanda incremental (aunque el crecimiento\nde la demanda puede disminuirse debido al reciente aumento en las tarifas.) y puede\n2Esta ya se hizo; y la septima ronda de negociaciones petroleras, usando lo que es, en\nesencia, un production-sharing agreement, esta teniendo buen exito.\nxviii\nenfrentar severas restricciones de capacidad y de energia inmediatamente y por el t6rmino\nmedio, tanto en t6rminos de generaci6n como de transmisi6n. Las restricciones de energia\nen temporada de sequia se estan empeorando ya que el sistema de planeaci6n ha\nfavorecido las soluciones hidroelectricas pero las plantas de apoyo termicas que eran\nrequeridas nunca fueron construidas. Como resultado, Ecuador ahora tiene que bregar\npara construir turbinas a gas las cuales pueden o no ser lo menos costoso para satisfacer la\ndemanda de los pr6ximos afnos. Fuera de esto, el plan de expansi6n requiere una inversi6n\nadicional en el rio Paute, donde esta localizado el 90% de la capacidad hidroelectrica del\nEcuador y la factibilidad tecnica de construir Paute Mazar no ha sido todavia firmemente\nestablecida. Mientras que a corto y a mediano termino no es mucho lo que se puede ganar\nrevisando el plan de expansi6n de generaci6n, a la larga, esta revisi6n podria ayudar a\ncorregir cualquier falla potencial en el programa, y definitivamente deberia ser lievada a\ncabo, junto con el fortalecimiento del proceso de planeaci6n para dar mas peso a las\nvariables econ6micas, riesgo y ambiente.\nReformas en el Subsector de Energia Electrica\n15. Dado el mas bien debil desempefno del subsector de la energia electrica, este\nestudio sugiere que se necesitan reformas sustanciales. Estas reformas deberian afectar el\nmarco regulatorio,la politica de tarifas y la reorganizaci6n institucional. Este Informe\nsugiere que la nueva agencia regulatoria (posiblemente para el sector de la energia en\nconjunto)3necesitaria ser independiente del proceso politico (tanto como sea posible),\npero tener acceso a los niveles mas altos del gobierno y ser tecnicamente excelente, a fin\nde conseguir credibilidad inmediata con las autoridades y empresas del sector.

It is worth noting in this connection\nthat public sector prices as well as the foreign exchange rate were fixed between 1972 and 1981.\nIn the subsequent years, the Ecuadorian economy experienced increasing imbalances (trade,\nfiscal) financed through sizeable external borrowing. Initially, this kept inflation at a relatively\nlow level; in the longer-run, though, higher inflation, in combination with the fixed exchange\nrate, led to a steady erosion of Ecuador's international competitiveness. Exports were reduced\nbasically to crude oil and a declining quantity of bananas. At the same time, domestic energy\nconsumption was heavily subsidized, either directly through extremely low petroleum product\nprices, or through oil export revenues spent on operating and expanding the electric power sector.\nIn fact, until the mid-1980s, oil export revenues, supplemented with borrowed money, were used\nto subsidize everything else, from antibiotics to credit.\n1.2 As is shown in the following paragraphs, real energy prices were low (indeed,\nbelow economic cost) in 1980 and have since declined almost constantly, with the exception of\n1981 and 1988 when unsuccessful steps were taken to reverse this trend. For instance, by 1991,\nelectricity tariffs for residential users and household fuel prices were down to 53.9% and 35%,\nrespectively, of their 1980 levels (see Tables 3 and 4).\n1.3 The subsidies on petroleum products and electricity, which reached 6% of GDP\nin 1991, used to account for a major share, if not all, of the fiscal deficit. In the mid-1980s, when\nexternal borrowing became more difficult, Ecuador started financing its fiscal deficit by incurring\narrears and creating credit. This caused a surge in inflation, with rates ranging between 50% and\n80% per annum. As is argued below, energy prices closer to economic costs can help cut the\nballooning fiscal deficits and, by obviating the need to create money (to finance the government\ndeficit), reduce inflation.\n2 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nOil Products\n1.4 According to the Hydrocarbons Law, the prices of fuels for the domestic market\n(including imports, but net of exports) are required to comply with some concept of historic\n(average) accounting cost. They thus do not reflect replacement costs and, much less, opportunity\ncosts. Price adjustments, even when designed to cover accounting costs, have been subject topolitical pressure, lagged behind other prices in the economy and eroded rapidly because ofinflation. In practice, oil product prices have only been revised when revenues of the State'sGeneral Budget (Presupuesto General del Estado -PGE) from domestic petroleum product sales\nproved totally insufficient to cover scheduled expenditures so that an immediate cash inflow\nbecame imperative.\n1.5 In 1989, the preceding govemment's administration introduced a policy of gradual,\nslow price adjustments. From April until September 1992, however, prices were frozen by orderof the Constitutional Rights Court (Tribunal de Garantias Constitucionales). Real prices,\ntherefore, resumed their decline until their recovery after the marked price increases of September\n1992, followed by a new round of increases in May 1993. Thus, the new government pursues\na policy of discrete price increases in lieu of the former gradual adjustment approach.\n1.6 The pricing policy pursued in the past provided no guidance for the economic use\nof scarce and valuable resources such as oil. It rather encouraged wasteful, low priority\nconsumption, fostered contraband and militated against energy conservation. Moreover, low\ndomestic prices hampered the development of non-conventional energy sources.\n1.7 In fact, the policy for setting fuel prices and electric power tariffs was touted asa vehicle for income-distribution. Energy pricing, however, is an inefficient means ofredistributing wealth. It is thus hardly surprising that this policy failed to reach its redistributive\nobjectives. In fact, under the prices that prevailed until September 1992, power subsidies accrued\nmostly to upper- and middle-income consumers (see paragraph 1.32). As for petroleum products,\nthe subsidies on vehicle fuels were reaped mostly by higher- and middle-income groups who ownprivate cars. The subsidies on kerex, which is no longer available to households at its low official\nprice, have been dissipated among a new breed of dealers (see praragraph 1.14). And while\npoorer households using LPG have benefitted from the subsidies granted to this fuel, an even\nlarger amount of the hand-outs has been enjoyed by the more affluent households.\n1.8 Moreover, the lack of sufficient coordination in setting the relative prices of energy\nsubstitutes has had severe distortive impacts. A good example is LPG which has been sold not\nonly below cost, but also below the price of electric power and other substitute fuels. As aconsequence, LPG is now used by many households on a large scale and in a variety of activities\nwhere other fuels are more economic or could prove a competitive alternative. Since LPG, of\nAnalysis of Energy Prices, Subsidies and State Revenues 3\nwhich a large share has to be imported (51% in 1991), sells at a high loss, this policy prompted\na major drain on public sector resources (see paragraph 1.27 and Annex IV).\n1.9 The new pricing structure put in place in September 1992 still implied cross\nsubsidies among the different petroleum products. The price of household LPG accounted for\n34.6% and that of kerex for only 5.3% of the average price of all oil products. Gasolines, on the\nother hand, were priced 110.2% (Super) and 27.9% (Extra) above the average. Moreover, the new\ndomestic price structure did not match the structure of costs at import parity (see Table 1). It\nshould also be noted that since the entire proceeds from sales in the domestic market accrue to\nthe state treasury, there is no such thing as a \"net of tax\" price which could be considered a\n\"producer\" price. For this reason, it is suggested to establish a pricing and taxation framework\nthat distinguishes between producer prices and the taxes added on for the purpose of raising\npublic revenue. ESMAP could assist the Government in devising and implementing this\nframework.\nTABLE 1: PRICING STRUCTURE OF OIL PRODUCTS\nDomestic Prices World Prices'\n% S./Gallon S/.

Growing\nLPG demand was also the result of constraints placed on the marketing of kerex, thus leading\nto a large-scale substitution of LPG for kerosene, even among the lowest-income families. As is\nshown in Table 2, LPG is the product with the highest rate of consumption growth between 1980\n4 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nand 1991. Diesel consumption has grown considerably during the last five years, and although\nannual average growth of gasoline consumption was modest, it should be kept in mind that the\nlevel of gasoline consumption is already high3.\nTABLE 2: ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF FUEL CONSUMPTION\nPeriod Gasolines Kerex Diesel Fuel Oil LPG\n1980-1985 -0.8% 3.6% 8.4% 15.4% 13.2%\n1986-1991 1.3% -20.1% 4.6% -8.2% 11.8%\n1.11 At present, refining capacity is sufficient to meet domestic demand (five\nrefineries with a production capacity of 148,000 barrels per day), except for LPG, and permits\nthe export of small quantities of diesel (2.1 million barrels in 1991 and 552,000 barrels between\nJanuary and March 1992). Although expansion of the Shushufindi gas plant would reduce\nimports and cover a greater share of national consumption, the expected replacement of LPG\nimports has not yet taken place. At any rate, the present situation is strongly in favor of pricing\npolicies that provide compelling incentives to use all petroleum products in a more efficient way.\n1.12 Until September 1992, household LPG, which is bottled in 15 kg cylinders, sold\nfor S/80/kg (US$ 0.05 per kg), far below the international price Petroecuador reported to pay for\nimports (US$ 265 per metric ton CIF). Even worse, this price failed to cover the costs of\nstorage, bottling, bulk and retail transport and the distributors' margin, which at that time added\nup to an average of S/120/kg. LPG for industrial and commercial use had a much higher price\n(US$0.30 per kg) more closely reflecting economic cost, but in practice, attracted only few\ncustomers as the price differential was overwhelmingly in favor of the 15 kg cylinder. Since\nSeptember 1992, LPG has been priced at S/193 per kg, equivalent to USc 10.7 per kg (at an\nexchange rate of S/l1,900 per US$ as of May 1993), while the price of LPG for industrial use has\nbeen S/564 per kg (about USc31.3 per kg). In late 1993, economic cost (import parity plus\ndownstream expenses), though, was estimated at US$ 400 per ton (S/760/kg). Thus, household\nLPG currently sells for less than a third of its economic costs.\n3 In 1985, gasoline consumption was about 10.19 million barrels compared to 6.62 million\nbarrels for diesel. Furthermore, in the same year, per-capita consumption was very much lower\nin Peru than in Ecuador (0.047 barrels per capita versus 1.14 barrels per capita).\nAnalysis of Energy Prices, Subsidies and State Revenues 5\n1.13 Before the September 1992 adjustments, the price of diesel, measured in terms of\nuseful energy, amounted to 85% of the price of gasoline. Thereafter, the price differential has\nbeen narrowing to the point where prices are on a par. Inefficiencies in vehicle fuel consumption,\nhowever, remain high, mainly because of the obsolescence of the passenger transport fleet, but\nalso because the fuels' price level was still too low to encourage conservation.\n1.14 Kerex distribution through regular service stations was discontinued in 1991 when\nPetroecuador changed its marketing policy. In order to stem the diversion of this highly\nsubsidized product toward industrial users, it was decided to restrict the supply of kerex to so-\ncalled traditional markets in cities and other urban and rural outlets, including agents such as\ncommunities and social welfare institutions. However, this has neither checked the product's\ndiversion toward non-household users, nor has it helped target the subsidies at low-income\ngroups. On the contrary, the restricted marketing of kerex has led to the cornering of its supply\nby a few major middlemen. Moreover, as a response to the large differential between the official\nkerex price of S/60 and the prices of its substitutes, Diesel 1 and Diesel 2 (S/630 and S/1,460\nbefore and after the adjustment, respectively), a black market, with a chain of middlemen, has\ndeveloped around this product. In fact, kerex is nowhere available at its regulated price. Before\nthe adjustments of September 1992, residential consumers had been charged between S/250 and\nS/650 per gallon or even more in remote rural areas. After the adjustments, the average retail\nprice soared to S/1,360 per gallon. In-the-field research done for this Study indicates that only\n45% of the kerex supply ends in household appliances. Consequently, the beneficiaries of\nsubsidies, far from being low-income groups, are the middlemen and industrialists who acquire\nkerex cheaper than its substitutes, Diesel 1 and Diesel 2.\n1.15 In July 1992, petroleum product prices (not including fuel oil), adjusted for\ninflation, were lower than in the preceding year, but still higher than in 1980, except for kerex\nand LPG which sold at 63% and 27% of their 1980 price levels (see Table 3). With the\nadjustments of September 1992, the real prices of gasolines, diesel and fuel oil reached the\nhighest level since 1980; and the real price of LPG rose beyond any level since 1986. The only\nexception was kerex whose inflation-adjusted price continued to decline. Needless to say,\ninflation, which kept being high, immediately started to erode the effects that the nominal price\nincreases had in real terms.\n6 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nTABLE 3: DOMESTIC PRICES OF OIL PRODUCTS\n(At constant 1992 prices)\n(Sucres/Gallon)\n1980 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992' 1992-\nGasoline 787 683 838 1150 1025 920 1051 910 2400\nSuper\nGasoline 203 525 685 900 791 683 758 650 1460\nExtra\nGasoline 177 210 320 210 293 361 319 240 240\nRegular\nDiesel 130 420 419 650 732 645 732 630 1460\nKerex 130 147 228 150 117 95 80 60 60\nFuel Oil 86 263 267 350 556 531 399 490 685\nLPG 303 105 114 100 108 95 106 80 193\n(SI/Kg.)\nPrior to the Adjustment on September 3, 1992\n* * After the adjustment on September 3, 1992\n(At current US$/Gallon)\n1980 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992* 1992**\nGasoline Super 0.66 0.44 0.57 0.53 0.62 0.59 0.72 0.61 1.33\nGasoline Extra 0.17 0.34 0.46 0.41 0.48 0.44 0.52 0.43 0.81\nGasoline Regular 0.15 0.13 0.22 0.10 0.18 0.23 0.22 0.16 0.13\nDiesel 0.11 0.27 0.28 0.30 0.44 0.41 0.50 0.42 0.81\nKerex 0.11 0.09 0.15 0.07 0.07 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03\nFuel Oil 0.07 0.17 0.18 0.16 0.33 0.34 0.27 0.33 0.38\nLPG (S//Kg.) 0.25 0.07 0.08 0.05 0.07 0.06 0.07 0.05 0.11\n* Exchange rate: S/1500/US$\nExchange rate: S/1800/US$ (free market)\n1.16 In US$ terms, domestic oil product prices declined too between 1991 and 1992,\nbut at a slower rate than in constant domestic prices since exchange rate depreciation fell short\nof domestic inflation. After the adjustments of September 1992, prices in US$ were comparable\nto international CIF prices (and even higher for premium gasoline), except for LPG and kerex.\n1.17 The importance of domestic pricing policy in neighboring countries should also\nbe mentioned. For example, the magnitude of the price differential with Peru and the country's\nradically different adjustment policy have made the illegal trade of oil products a pervasive\nAnalysis of Energy Prices, Subsidies and State Revenues 7\nproblem. In 1990, it was estimated that the value of fuels smuggled across the border amounted\nto US$131.8 million (based on an opportunity cost of US$ 20.05 per barrel of Ecuadorean oil\nsold during that year), which in terms of volume accounted for 6.3% of total hydrocarbons\nproduction in that year.\nElectric Power Tariffs\n1.18 Pursuant to the Basic Electrification Law, tariffs must reflect service costs which,\namong other things, include operating expenses, reserves for depreciation and an annual profit.\nINECEL's Board of Directors sets electric power tariffs on the basis of information provided by\nthe power utilities.\n1.19 The tariff structure is based on different consumer groups and end users\n(residential, commercial, industrial, public lighting and government agencies), rather than on the\ncosts of supply and time of use, which would be more appropriate. In addition, there are charges\nfor contracted demand of larger industrial and commercial users. Different capacity and energy\ncharges apply to medium-to-high voltage consumers. Within each consumer category, there are\nincreasing block rates, except for customers paying a separate demand or capacity charge, whose\nrates for energy decline as consumption increases. The highest average tariffs are charged to\nindustrial users, followed by commercial users; average residential tariffs are the lowest. This\nis opposite to the policy applied in most Latin American countries where industrial tariffs on\naverage are lower than residential and commercial tariffs, thus accounting for differences in the\ncost of service and load characteristics.\n1.20 While there is a uniform tariff system for non-utility users throughout the country,\nthe charges for bulk power sold by INECEL to utilities (which in many cases are mere\ndistribution companies) are discriminatory. In 1991, the average bulk tariff was USc 1.68 per\nkWh. Small distribution companies or those with financial difficulties are offered the lowest\nprices for both contracted demand and energy. In 1991, the highest average wholesale rates were\ncharged to the Cotopaxi and Quito utilities (USc 2.01 per kWh and USc 1.95 per kWh,\nrespectively) and the lowest were billed to the Milagro and Bolivar utilities (USc 0.69 per kWh\nand USc 0.65 per kWh, respectively). Thus, pricing of bulk power implies cross subsidies among\ndistribution companies. This system was created to favor utilities supplying unattractive markets\nwith a large proportion of small and dispersed customers, thus fostering regional and social\ndevelopment. However, cross-subsidization may have adverse effects on efficiency, both for those\nutilities paying more and those protected. An alternative approach would be to set bulk power\nrates more in line with the different costs of supply and, at the same time, let the utilities have\nthe discretion to taylor the retail tariffs to their customers.\n8 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n1.21 Just as for fuel prices, electric power tariffs have been handled with a political\nbias, mainly in order to redistribute income toward poorer consumers, a goal which has only been\nachieved to a limited extent. On the other hand, what the low level and distortive structure of the\ntariffs have brought about until late 1992 is high, wasteful consumption, particularly among\nresidential users and in the industrial sector. Also, little attention has been given to another\nimportant objective of rate setting, that of providing sufficient resources to generation and\ndistribution companies. The tariffs prevailing until September 1992 did not even cover the\nsystem's operating costs, and much less the financial requirements of expanding supply to meet\nfuture demand. While the average tariff in 1991 was USc 3.23 per kWh, the cost at the retail\nlevel amounted to USc 5.62 per kWh. This imbalance aggravated INECEL's poor financial and\neconomic condition. In 1991, power sales accounted for only 52.2% of the Institute's cash flow\nrequirements (the balance was made up of government transfers and borrowing). The low share\nof revenues accounted for by power sales, together with INECEL's high debt and the parallel\nreduction in revenues from oil royalties, have considerably increased the company's dependence\non National Government contributions, which accounted for 42.4% of its cash flow in 1991, and\n43.6% in the period between January and June 1992. In fact, INECEL was receiving in excess\nof US$100 million/year in oil transfers between the mid 1970s and 1985. Thereafter, oil transfers\nfell to about US$50 million in 1986 and US$20 million in 1987, becoming negligible after 1988.\n1.22 In 1989, INECEL resorted to automatic, monthly rate adjustments of 3% in order\nto protect the tariff's (real) value against the detrimental effects of inflation. However, the first\n80 kWh/month, and from November 1990 onwards, the first 200 kWh/month of all residential\ncustomers, as well as the first 80 kWh/month of commercial users not subjected to a demand\ncharge were exempted from this rule. The tariffs on these special blocks increased in line with\nthe rise in the minimum wage. The 200 kWh/month ceiling for residential customers was\nmaintained after the September 1992 price reform, but commercial users were no longer entitled\nto benefit from the freeze.\n1.23 Table 4 shows that, in constant Sucres, the average tariff paid by the residential\nsector during the period 1986-1991 was lower than in 1980 (the 1991 tariff was 53.9% of the\n1980 tariff and the average tariff of 1991 was 84.5% of the tariff) prevailing 1980. Although\nthe average industrial sector tariff ended up 31% higher in 1991 than in 1980, this was not\nsufficient to match the system's operating costs. As a consequence, the situation before\nSeptember 1992 was so financially unsustainable that it urgently required a substantial rise in\ntariffs, to allow both INECEL and the distribution companies to improve their cash flow and start\ncovering their costs.\nAnalysis of Energy Prices, Subsidies and State Revenues 9\nTABLE 4: ELECTRICITY TARIFFS BY END USE\n(Current Sucres/kWh annual average)\nUse:\nYear Household Industrial Commercial Others Average\n1980 1.3 1.1 1.7 1.2 1.3\n1986 4.1 4.9 5.1 4.6 4.6\n1987 5.8 7.0 7.2 6.4 6.5\n1988 7.7 9.5 9.8 8.9 8.8\n1989 10.7 19.2 18.9 17.9 15.7\n1990 14.9 28.2 27.3 25.9 22.6\n1991 22.8 46.9 44.5 38.8 35.7\n1992* 50.7 70.7 59.7 57.6 57.3\n1992** 96.4 123.9 151.7 176.7 113.6\nELECTRICITY TARIFFS BY END USE ANNUAL AVERAGES\n(Constant Sucres /kWh, 1992=100)\nYear Use:\nHousehold Industrial Commercial Others Average\n1980 56.2 47.6 73.5 51.9 56.2\n1986 43.1 51.5 53.6 48.3 48.3\n1987 44.2 53.3 54.8 48.7 49.5\n1988 38.5 47.5 49.0 44.5 44\n1989 31.3 56.2 55.3 52.4 46.0\n1990 28.3 53.5 51.8 49.1 42.9\n1991 30.3 62.4 59.2 51.6 47.5\n1992* 50.7 70.7 59.7 57.6 57.3\n1992** 96.4 123.9 151.7 176.7 113.6\nBefore September 3, 1992\nAfter September 3, 1992\n10 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n1.24 In keeping with the system proposed in the recently completed tariff study, end-usediscrimination should be abandoned. Rather, tariffs should be based on service costs, including\na surcharge accounting for the comparatively high generation cost during the dry season. Inaddition, the study has defined dual-rate tariffs, varying by time and use. They could be applied,at first, to the industrial sector and to other large consumers. The September 1992 adjustment\nonly raised the level of tariffs without changing their structure or the rate base (i.e. cost ofservice, rather than end-use).\n1.25 Equity and efficiency considerations would suggest that the state itself pay any\nsubsidies that were decided on \"lifeline\" consumptions. A second best solution would be forhigher-income consumers (eg, those using, say, more than 500 or 1000 kWh per month) tofinance this subsidy. Lifeline consumption should be set at a reasonable level, say, 50-80 kWhper month and apply only to consumers using those quantities of electricity or less. The tariffincrease of September 1992, however, did not raise the price of the first 200 kWh of any\nconsumer and stated that, henceforth, \"tariffs would remain fixed\". This meant that no one knew(there was, and still is, no coherent policy) what would happen when the next tariff increase\nwould be needed. Furthermore, the subsidy on lifeline consumption should be set at a suitablepercentage (say, 50%) of the cost of serving this consumer class (to make sure that the subsidydoes not grow without limit).\nSubsidies on Consumption of Petroleum Products and Electricity: A Summary\n1.26 Prior to the September 1992 adjustments, the annual subsidy to energy\nconsumption in Ecuador totaled US$624.3 million. Of this, US$ 400.9 (64%) was on oilderivatives and US$ 223 million (36%) on electric power. After the September price increase,the overall subsidy on energy consumption fell to US$ 101.36 million, of which US$ 3.45 millionis a net tax charged on consumption of oil products and US$ 104.81 million is the subsidy onelectricity.

The fuel price adjustments,\nhowever, resulted in a surplus of about US$3.45 million.4After the reform, LPG, kerosene and\n4 The above subsidy was calculated by estimating the CIF value of oil products based on\nthe domestic consumption structure for 1992 (Annex, Table 1) and comparing this to the\ndomestic prices prevailing until September 1992, using sales for oil products of that year, with\nthe costs estimated by the National Hydrocarbons Directorate (Direcci6n Nacional de\nHidrocarburos- DNH).\n12 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nfuel oil consumption still received cross subsidies of about US $90 million, US $5.1 million, andUS$ 3.3 million, respectively. However, these amounts were more than offset by surpluses fromthe other derivatives, notably gasolines.\nSubsidies on Electricity\n1.28 Under the tariff regime which was in effect before September 1992, thoseconsumers which were not subject to a demand charge, received a monthly subsidy totaling\nUS$12 million. For consumers affected by a demand charge, the subsidy amounted to US$5.9million a month. The aggregate annual subsidy was estimated at US $223 million, almost 2%\nof GDP in 1991, or 21 % of INECEL' s external debt. Under the revised tariff levels that prevailed\nbetween September 1992 and April 1993, the estimated annual subsidy declined to US$ 104million. Since May 1993, when a new tariff system was imposed, the estimated total annualsubsidy dropped to US$27.7 million (see Table 6). The current level of subsidies is probablysomewhat lower since the tariff increases must have put downward pressure on electricity\ndemand.\n1.29 The above estimates have been obtained as follows: Subsidies accruing toconsumers not affected by a demand charge are equal to the difference between marginal cost(USc8.3 1/kWh) and the tariffs prevailing from June 1992 until September 3, 1992, broken downby consumption blocks. For consumers exposed to a demand charge, the marginal cost wasUSc6.82 per kWh. Electricity consumption in July and September is approximated by figuresrecorded for January 1992. No attempt has been made to account for the decline in consumption\nattributable to the higher tariffs. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that the January 1992figures are beset with electric power shortages due to the seasonal drought. Also, thecomparatively low costs of LPG may have encouraged more affluent households to substitute\nLPG for electricity in water heating.\n1.30 Under the tariff regime which was in effect before September 1992, most of thebenefits accrued to the residential sector which accounted for 43% of total electricityconsumption and reaped 57.4% of the total subsidy in July 1992, followed distantly bycommercial users not subjected to a demand charge who shared 9.1% of the subsidy. Industrialusers subject to a demand charge, who accounted for 27% of total consumption, received a share\nof 18.4% of the subsidy.\n1.31 Unlike the old tariff regime which provided all customers with subsidies, the newrate structure, established in September 1992, required public sector users, industry andcommercial enterprises (subject to a demand charge) to fund part of the subsidies granted to othercustomers, mainly the residential sector. Among residential users, those consuming more than1,000 kWh per month contributed marginally to financing the subsidy for smaller residential\nusers. The latest changes in tariffs, which took place in May 1993, reduced the monthly subsidyfor residential users from US$ 8.8 million (US$ 105.6 million a year) to US$ 6.1 million (US$\nAnalysis of Energy Prices, Subsidies and State Revenues 13\n73 million a year). Since large consumers were already paying higher tariffs, the May 1993 tariff\nincreases were highest (504%) for customers using no more than 20 kWh/month, and lowest (on\naverage 54%) for those consuming more than 1,500 kWh/month. In addition, a marketing charge\nwas imposed to recover metering costs. However, inflation continued to erode the real impact of\nthese increases. The following Table provides a breakdown of subsidies on electricity by end\nuse and date.\nTABLE 6: ANNUAL SUBSIDIES ON ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION\nBY END USE\n(US$ THOUSANDS)\nJULY 1992 SEPTEMBER 1992 MAY 1993'\nWithout Demand Charge\nHouseholds 128,220 105,660 73,080\nCommercial 20,424 1,560 -5,604\nHandicrafts 2,088 672 -588\nGov.

While households using no more than 50 kWh per month represented 35% of\nresidential customers, until September 1992 they benefitted from only 1.9% (equivalent to US$\n0.44/month/user) of the total subsidy granted to the sector. Likewise, users consuming more than\n300 kWh, 500 kWh and 1,000 kWh a month received a monthly subsidy of US$ 20, US$ 33,\n14 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nand US$ 91, respectively. This confirms the view that the old tariff regime failed to meet its\nredistributive objectives. With the new (September 1992) tariff structure, the monthly subsidy for\nusers consuming no more than 20 kWh/month declined to US$ 0.3 1/month/user, and the subsidy\nto users buying more than 300 kWh and 500 kWh dropped to (still formidable) US$\nI.1/month/user and US$ 12/month/user, respectively. Hence, the tariff reform reduced, but did\nnot eliminate the regressive nature of the residential rate structure.\nAlternate Calculation of Subsidy on Oil Products\n1.33 An alternative approach to estimating the subsidies on petroleum products is to\nfocus on the price differential between export crude and crude supplied to the domestic market\n(through domestic refineries). Assuming that the downstream costs by and large were matched\nby sales revenues, the subsidies on domestic consumption of petroleum derivatives (approximated\nin terms of forgone export revenues) would have amounted to US$ 475.2 million in 1991 and\nUS$ 528.6 million in 1992, equivalent to 4.3% of GDP. These figures are fairly close to the\nestimates based on opportunity cost imputed to the different products sold in domestic markets.\nTABLE 7: ESTIMATE OF ANNUAL SUBSIDY ON DOMESTIC SALES OF FUELS\nBASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CRUDE OIL PRICES\nFOR DOMESTIC AND EXPORT MARKETS\nYEAR Subsidies GDP Subsidies/GDP\nUS$ Million US$ Million\n1980 962.5 11733 8.2%\n1986 81.9 10515 0.8%\n1987 178.7 9450 1.9%\n1991 475.2 11554 4.1%\n1992 528.6 12483 4.2%\n1.34 Another way of appreciating the size of the subsidy on oil products to the domestic\nconsumer is to look at the value added of oil refining in the National Accounts. This has a\nnegative value because intermediate purchases of crude, costed at international prices, exceed\nthe gross value of production at domestic market prices. Between 1986 and 1992, this negative\nvalue has increased by 47%, from S/6.4 billion in 1966 to S/9.4 billion in 1992 (in constant\nprices of 1975). These figures are broadly consistent with the two estimates presented above,\ni.e., opportunity cost of products; opportunity cost of crude.\nAnalysis of Energy Prices, Subsidies and State Revenues 15\nImpact of Oil Products Price and Power Tariff Increases on Production Costs and on the\nPrice Index\nOil\n1.35 Bringing the domestic prices that were charged for oil products before September\n1992 in line with import/export parity costs would have resulted in an aggregate price increase\nof approximately 100%. Such an increase would have raised the producer price index by 5.42%,\nthe consumer price index by 5.90% and the export price index by 5.03%. Table 8 provides a\nmore detailed picture of the effects that higher petroleum product prices would have on the\ndifferent price indices.\nTABLE 8: INCREASE IN COSTS FROM INCREASE\nIN A VERA GE FUEL PRICE\n(% Cost Increase)\n% Increase in Average Prices:\nSectors 10 20 50 100 150 200 300\nGrowth in Producer Price\nIndex 0.54 1.08 2.71 5.42 8.13 10.84 16.26\nGrowth in Household\nConsumer Price Index 0.59 1.18 2.95 5.90 8.85 11.80 17.70\nOther Exports 0.50 1.01 2.52 5.03 7.55 10.07 15.10\nSource: Banco Central del Ecuador, lmput-Output Matrix and ESMAP calculations (Table 9 Annex VI)\n1.36 As expected, transportation is one of the sectors most hurt by a 100% increase in\nfuel prices: costs would rise by 21.6%. This may pose social problems that the Government\nhas to cope with. In fact, many of the urban mass transport passengers belong to the lower\nincome group and, therefore, might find it difficult to absorb higher fares. Consequentely, in\n1993, i.e. after the upward adjustment of fuel prices, each urban mass transport vehicle was\nreceiving a subsidy of S/600,000 (US$ 310) a month to keep the fares fixed. But the\ntransportation associations, which wield considerable power, have been fighting to raise fares.\n1.37 Another important sector that would be impacted is electricity generation, since\noil products account for about 15% of the intermediate demand of the power generation industry\n5 According to a study conducted by the National Energy Institute (Instituto Nacional de\nEnergia), prior to September 1992, fuel accounted for 23% of total operating costs in urban bus\ntransportation. So the price increase of September 1992 may just have had the predicted effect\non total transport cost.\n16 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n(although most of the country's electric power is generated by hydropower, with a 77.03% share\nin 1991). The burden that higher fuel prices place on electric power could rise even more asa result of the increasing share of thermal generation which is due to unusually low precipitations\nin recent years.\n1.38 This Study used the input-output matrix of the Central Bank to estimate the short-\nterm impact of changes in oil product prices and electricity tariffs on production costs, the\ngeneral price index and the export price index. The latter was included because of the importance\nthe external sector to the economy. To this end, the matrix, which covers, 34 sectors was\nconsolidated into 17 by merging similar sectors and singling out those with a high energy\nintensity. The matrix with the latest information was that of 1989. Only increases in energy costs\nwere taken into account and not those of other primary inputs. In addition, it was assumed that\nthe cost increases are passed on to consumers. The imput-output table further assumes that the\nprice elasticity of energy demand is zero. All this is truer in the short-term than in the medium\nto long term. With the passing of time, though, interfuel substitution and conservation measures\nbecome feasible alternatives and will weaken the impact of the cost increases to some extent.\n1.39 The findings show that the chemical and basic mineral industries, among which\nis the cement industry, would experience an increase in production costs of 9.1 % and 8.4%. The\nconstruction sector would suffer from a 6% rise in cost. Thus, even in the case of energy-\nintensive industries the inflationary effect of a 100% increase in fuel prices is bound to be\nmodest.\nPower\n1.40 Before September 1992, the weighted average electricity tariff was S/50/kWh.\nIncreasing this figure by 150% gives the marginal costs of S/125/kWh calculated in INECEL's\ntariff study. This increase would have raised the consumer price index by 3.5%, the producer\nprice index by 3.7%, and the general index by 3.1%. The impact on export prices would have\nbeen negligible (less than 2%) since the export-oriented sectors have a low electricity intensity.\nTable 9 summarizes the results.\nAnalysis of Energy Prices, Subsidies and State Revenues 17\nTABLE 9: COST INCREASES DUE TO INCREASE IN AVERAGE ELECTRIC POWER TARIFFS\nPrice Increase\nSectors 10% 20% 50% 100% 150% 200% 300%\nGrowth in general inflation 0.20% 0.41% 1.02% 2.04% 3.06% 4.08% 6.12%\nGrowth in producer index 0.25% 0.49% 1.23% 2.45% 3.68% 4.90% 7.35%\nGrowth in household consumer price 0.24% 0.47% 1.18% 2.35% 3.53% 4.70% 7.05%\nindex\nOther exports 0.13% 0.26% 0.64% 1.28% 1.92% 2.56% 3.84%\nSource: Input-Output Matrix Banco Central de Ecuador and ESMAP calculations\n1.41 The sectors most affected by higher tariffs would be basic minerals, chemicals,\nmachinery and equipment, with cost increases of 7.8%, 6.0% and 5.7%, respectively. Again, these\nfigures suggest that the inflationary impact of even large tariff adjustments is moderate.\nState Revenues from Oil Product Sales in the Domestic Market and Exports\n1.42 As required by law, revenues from oil product sales, once production, refining and\nmarketing costs are deducted by Petroecuador, are distributed as follows: 10% flow into the Oil\nInvestments Fund (Fondo de Inversiones Petroleras) and 90% to the General State Budget (PGE)\nand other participants. The PGE also receives revenues amounting to 10% of domestic sales in\nthe form of a value-added tax and collects a so called \"single\" tax which, expressed in sucres per\ngallon, amounts to S/1.71 for gasoline, S/0.22 for kerex, S/0.34 for diesel, and S/0.05 for fuel oil.\n1.43 In 1991, the 90% share accounted for 21% of total oil revenues collected by the\nPGE. Bearing in mind that oil accounts for 46% of the PGE's overall revenues during 1991,\ndomestic sales contributed about S/178 billion.\n1.44 During the first half of 1992, the PGE received 46.7% of the value of oil products\nsold in the domestic market. Total sales were S/322.9 billion and the Budget received S/150.7\nbillion (including the value-added tax).\n1.45 To obtain an estimate of the increase in earnings which resulted from the\nSeptember 1992 increase in oil product prices on the domestic market, a sales forecast from the\nDNH's pricing study and its underlying consumption structure was used as a reference. The\ncosts estimated by the DNH for refining, evaporation and marketing as well as the distributor\n18 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nmargins were subtracted from the set retail prices. Revenues which would be generated by the\n10% VAT were also added (Annex VI Tables 2-5). The price of crude for the domestic market\nwas adjusted to US$4.19 per barrel (from the previous level of US$2.32), and the refining margin\nwas set at US$3.15. The price elasticity of demand was supposed to be -0.2. Under these\nassumptions, the increase in revenues from domestic sales for the last four-month period of 1992\nwould total US$98.4 million, plus US$40.6 from increasing crude exports. For 1993, the increase\nin revenues would be US$294.4, plus US$121.7 from higher crude exports. Moreover, to\nprevent the extra-revenues from flowing to the so-called \"participants\" of oil earnings, a special\ntax accruing to the PGE could be levied on oil sales (with appropriate restrictions to avoid an\nautomatic increase in expenditures).\n1.46 To mitigate the impact that the pricing reforms may have (and might have had)\non the budget and living conditions of low-income groups, up to a third of the public sector\nrevenue gains could be earmarked to strenghten social support programs and to ease the\nadjustment to pending price increases, particularly that of LPG. A companion report offers a\nmore detailed description of a suggested mitigation policy. Briefly put, the first component of the\nproposal is to free the supply of kerex prior to the liberalization of the LPG price and to establish\na temporary energy subsidy fund targeted at the poorest households. In addition, it is\nrecommended to commit part of the extra revenues to selected social services and relief programs\nthat have proven effective and are highly appreciated by the beneficiaries (i.e., those focusing on\nnutrition, health, and human resource development).\n2\nELIMINATION OF OIL AND POWER SUBSIDIES:\nIMPACTS ON FISCAL DEFICIT,\nMONEY SUPPLY AND INFLATION\nIntroduction\n2.1 This section presents the results of a simulation, for 1991, of the impact on the\nfollowing variables of putting energy prices at their economic levels:\nThe fiscal deficit,\nthe need for monetary emission (to finance the deficit)\nthe effect on inflation (its reduction) thanks to the lower fiscal deficit and reduced\nemission.\n2.2 In brief, the results are that setting oil prices at opportunity costs and electric\npower tariffs at their Long-Run Marginal Costs (LRMC) would have increased oil revenues by\nabout S/342 billion (2.9% of GDP), power revenues by about S/233 billion (1.9% of GDP) for\na total of S/575 billion (4.7% of GDP). If about one-third of the additional revenues were used\nfor social compensation/mitigation programs there would still remain additional revenues of S/383\nbillion (3.2% of GDP). This would finally repay the \"social debt\" and essentially wipe out the\nfiscal deficit thereby greatly reducing the need for monetary emission and, hence, the rate of\ninflation. The rate of inflation would not, however, fall to zero because of the monetary impact\nof changes in external assets. This would diminish, in the longer term, or could, if thought really\nnecessary, be sterilized by monetary/fiscal counter measures. However, recent research at the\nBank6shows that while stopping a hyperinflation is comparatively easy, eliminating this residual,\nexpectations-related, low inflation takes time. Even with this proviso, inflation would fall by\n6 Kiguel, M. and N. Liviatan: Stopping Three Big Inflations (Argentina, Brazil and\nPeru); World Bank Working Paper No. WPS 999; October 1992.\n20 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\napproximately 60% within the year and this positive result would hold even if about a third of\nadditional public revenues were used to mitigate/compensate low-income consumers (through\npublic expenditures or direct money subsidies) for the rise in the prices of energy and energy-\nintensive goods and services they consumed.\n2.3 This section implies that a lot more could be done in favor of low-income,\ndisadvantaged Ecuadoreans by selling energy at economic prices (rather than subsidizing it) and\nusing a fraction of additional revenues to address the specific problems of poverty or of low-\nproductivity employment (the working poor, as most poor Ecuadoreans really are). Furthermore,\nhaving sensible economic policies would improve the prospects for economic growth, a benefit\nthat goes beyond the simple expenditure of revenues (raised via taxation or the selling of publicly\nsupplied goods and services) to solve specific poverty problems. Curing inflation will also be\nbeneficial to low-income people because they are the least able to defend themselves against\ninflation and to protect their incomes from the inflation tax. The data in this section are not\nexactly the same as in the rest of this report because of the need to use time series (monetary\naggregates, fiscal and quasi fiscal deficits, ... etc.) so the size of revenues and subsidies may be\ndifferent in some cases but this would not invalidate the general conclusion of this section that\nhigher energy prices would reduce inflation rather than increase it, as is the popular belief in\nEcuador. A fuller technical treatment of the analysis on which this section is based is attached\nas Annex IV.\n2.4 The economic measures proposed in this report are to essentially bring prices to\ntheir economic levels, namely for oil prices to reflect opportunity costs (mostly world prices CIF\nEcuador) and for electricity tariffs to reflect Long-Run Marginal Costs (LRMC). These measures\nhave substantial economic and social impacts. An attempt was made, via a simple monetary\nmodel, to estimate the impact of increased public revenues on monetary emission and thence, on\ninflation, a chronic problem of the Ecuadorean economy, due partly to the Central Bank's\nfinancing of a large share of the fiscal deficit. The proposed pricing policy would eliminate the\nfiscal deficit (see below) and the need for monetary emission. These powerful results will only\nbecome permanent if fiscal financial discipline is maintained, otherwise, higher domestic prices\nwill only result in higher expenditures: the well known tax-tax, spend-spend cycle. In addition,\nas part and parcel of a program of measures designed to improve the allocation of resources,\nhigher energy prices will contribute to efficiency and competitiveness in Ecuadorean productive\nactivities.\nElimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 21\nThe results\n2.5 The effects of increased energy prices on public revenues, fiscal deficit, money\nsupply and inflation are summarized in Table 10. The results show that eliminating oil and power\nsubsidies would definitely eliminate the fiscal deficit and in addition, generate a substantial fiscal\nsurplus of 345 billion sucres or 2.9% of GDP (based on the lower estimate). Monetary financing\nof the public deficit would no longer be required. And, since the domestic component of\nmonetary emission would be eliminated, the rate of inflation would be drastically reduced by\nabout 60%. The remaining 40% of inflation is mainly the monetary consequence of the\naccumulation of international reserves. In the long term, however, the impact on inflation of this\nexternal origin of monetary emission could be offset.\n2.6 Monetary and deflationary goals would be achieved even if, in line with more\nrecent pronouncements, some of the additional revenues were used to compensate the poor people\nwho bear a large share of adjustment costs, i.e. even if the \"social debt\" were paid off. In fact,\nour calculations show that even if one third of additional revenues (192 billion sucres) were used\nto mitigate the impact of price adjustments on low-income households, there would nonetheless\nbe sufficient revenues to eliminate the deficit, the need for monetary emission and, thence, to\ndramatically reduce inflation. Thus, even in the case of sizeable social mitigation, the\nconsolidated fiscal deficit would be more than eliminated, going from -230.8 billion sucres in\n1991 (-1.9% of GDP) to a surplus of 152.6 billion (+1.2% of GDP). In this case, the absolute\nreduction in inflation, in the long term, is in the order of 95%, that is, virtually no inflation.\nSince, this price correction is the result of an 86.4% reduction in monetary emission, the related\nelasticity will be about 1.10 which is very much in line with the recent evolution of the\nEcuadorean economy. This a posteriori justification fully validates the impact calculations.\n22 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nTable 10: Impact on Increased Energy Prices on Public Revenues,\nFiscal Deficit Money Creation and Inflation, 1991\n(billion current sucres)\nMeasure Proposed Price Deregulation Policy ADDITIONAL\nSOCIAL\nMITIGATION\nPOLICY /2\nImpact on: Elimination of Elimination of Elimination of Assigning 1/3\nOil Subsidies Power Subsidies Oil and Power Additional Revenues\nSubsidies to Social Spending\nPublic S/3,525 bn S/3,416 bn S.3,758 bn S/3,566 bn\nRevenues (NFPS) + 2.8% +1.9% GDP + 4.7% GDP +3.2 % GDP\nConsolidated Fiscal (Surplus) (Surplus) (Surplus)\nDeficit (NFPS) SI+ Ill bn S/-3 bn S/ +344 BN S/+ 153 bn\n(0.9% GDP) (2.8% GDP) (1.3% GDP)\nMoney (+42 bn) (+86 bn)\nEmission I/ None Practically\n(excluding international Required nonerequired\nreserve monetization)\nCorrection obtained Sl-141 bn S/-96 bn S/237 bn\n(in %) -77% -52% -129%\nPrice Index (1978=100)\nShort-term\nAdjustment 4/\n(in %)\n-35% -24.5% -59% -40%\nPrice Index 774.3 1,913.0 0 227.7\n(1978=100)\nAfter Long-term\nAdjustment 4/\nInflation rate +8.5% +21% No more inflation No more\n(annual growth) inflation\nAfter adjustments\n1/ After deduction of monetary emission due to the annual variation in International Monetary Reserves (IR), whose\nsize is exogenous.\n2/ Part of additional revenues used to compensate the impact of the price adjustment costs on low-income\nhouseholds.\n3/ Memo item: GDP 1991=12,149.1 bn current sucres (p) and 1991 inflation rate: 50.5%\n4/ Residual inflation is due to the monetary consequences of the accumulation of International Reserves.

Based on this\nmodel, simulation of monetary and deflationary impacts were performed for 1991.

Adjustments in Fiscal Deficit\n2.8 The fiscal deficit in Ecuador has two origins: the Non-Financial Public Sector\n(NFPS) and the Central Bank. Current fiscal expenditures are mostly assumed by the NFPS,\nwhich is disproportionately large compared to the rest of the economy. In 1990, NFPS gross\nexpenditures amounted to 38.1% of GDP. Moreover, this does not include all of the interest\npayments due, since about one-half of the interest payments due by the NFPS is serviced by the\nCentral Bank. It is thus clear that, in the case of Ecuador, the relevant concept to measure the\nfinancial needs of the public sector is the consolidation of both the NFPS deficit and the net\nresults of Central Bank operations or Quasi-Fiscal deficit.\n2.9 This illustrates how tenuous the fiscal balance is when it depends on a single\nsource of revenue for so much. Fiscal years 1989-1991 closed balanced on a cash basis (but 50%\ninterests obligations are assumed by the Central Bank) but accrued interest on the external debt\nreached 21% of current expenditures in 1989 and 1990. The oil price windfall in 1990\ncontributed decisively to this outcome.\n2.10 The Central Bank's quasi-fiscal deficit is mainly due to the extraneous fiscal role\nof the Bank, which is at the center of a complex maze of subsidies to and from the NFPS and\nthe private sector. By far the most important is the assumption by the bank of the external debt\nof both the public and private sectors (39.7% of GDP in 1989). This large external indebtedness\nis mainly due to the rescheduled public debt of the Treasury shifted onto the books of the Central\nBank (20% GDP). These external interests due amounted to S/227.7 bn in 1990.\n24 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nB. Measurement of the monetary impact\n2.11 The consistency between consolidated fiscal deficits and other macroeconomic\ntargets can be judged by looking at the government budget constraint. This constraint says that\nthe sum of the noninterest deficit and the interest bill on foreign and domestic debt is equal to\nthe sum of financing from all sources. Fiscal deficits can be financed in three ways; issuing\nexternal debt (or incurring arrears), issuing interest-bearing internal debt, and obtaining monetary\nfinancing. It is important to capture the difference between monetary financing and the external\naccrued debt. As monetary emission is performed on a cash basis, the overall fiscal deficit was\ncalculated both on a cash and accrual basis, to allow for estimation of external arrears. Between\n1987 and 1991, some of the monetary consequences of fiscal deficits have been avoided through\nthe accumulation of arrears on external interest payments.\n2.12 The second approach to monetary emission is on the supply side. From the Central\nBank balance sheet we can derive that high powered money (H) is the sum of monetary financing\n(or domestic credit to the government (DCg) plus the monetization of international reserves, asset\naccumulation (IR) and credit to the private sector (CPS) with other liabilities of the Central Bank.\nThe external origin of monetary emission due to reserves accumulation or revaluation was 53%\nof total emmission in 1990 and 57.6% in 1991. In equation 1, only the money supply of\ndomestic origin was considered: it demonstrates a strong elasticity of 1.15 in respect to changes\nin the fiscal deficit.\nC. Measurement of the deflationary impact\n2.13 The econometric model underlying equation 2 is based on a pragmatic view of\ninflation from the perspectives of public finance (Phelps, 1973) and of monetary approach (J. J.\nPolak, 1977). In the short run, demand pressure or cost push factors such as changes in the wage\nor in the nominal exchange rate may be important determinants of inflation. Such factors,\nhowever, contribute little to the understanding of sustained inflation. Excess demand pressure,\nas Friedman (1978) points out, should lead to accelerating rather than sustained inflation. To\nexplain sustained inflation rates requires analyzing the fiscal implications of such inflation. The\nfiscal view of inflation points that short-term links between inflation and deficits are likely to be\ntenuous, but that any deficit coupled with a sustainable, constant ratio of debt to output implies\na particular inflation rate.\n2.14 There are three main sources of sustained inflation in Ecuador: the NFPS fiscal\ndeficit, the quasi-fiscal deficit of the Central Bank and the monetization of international reserves.\nIn the short run, the elimination of the NFPS fiscal deficit, by the way of eliminating subsidies,\nwill reduce inflation by about 60%. The residual inflation is mainly due to the fiscal role of the\nCentral Bank and its related policy of reserves monetization as an additional and less obvious\nway of financing the public deficit. However, in the long term, this residual source of inflation\nElimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 25\nwould be offset as a rational consequence of fiscal adjustments. Recent World Bank research,\nhowever, may suggest that this may take time and effort.7\n2.15 The elimination of subsidies should help the Central Bank (BCE) to recover its\nmonetary policy function. In fact, a large fiscal surplus will provide the Government with the\nability to service its own external debt. Public external debt could thus be retransferred to the\nCentral Government. There is no reason why the BCE should continue to play a marked role in\nfiscal and financial intermediation. As the paper shows, the BCE would not need to run any\ndeficit, if its only function were that of regulating monetary aggregates. In addition, the BCE\nshould recover sufficient resources in order to regulate the monetary consequences of the\naccumulation of reserves due to real surpluses in the balance of payments. The monetization of\nreserves is the third cause of inflation. In fact, two factors can offset the monetary consequences\nof the accumulation of international reserves. First, the net accumulation of positive balances in\nthe Central Bank by the Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS) will offset the balance of payments\nsurpluses and the related increase in monetary base. Inflation will be reduced. As a result,\ndomestic savings will increase, leading to additional sterilization of high powered money. Second,\ncuring inflation will restore Ecuadorean competitiveness. The process of depreciation of the local\ncurrency will stop, as well as the related revaluation (in sucres) of the stock of international\nmonetary reserves. Monetary consequences of this latter appreciation will be eliminated. These\nvirtuous circles will lead to successive reduction of inflation, within an interval between -60%\nand -100%, or more.\n2.16 The price increases themselves will cause an increase in the costs of all economic\nactivities and of consumption. The table below summarizes these impacts. It should be noted that\nthese are maximum and short-term impacts as consumers and producers will adjust their\nconsumption and thus lower the impact of these higher prices on their costs and budgets.\nFurthermore, these cost increases are a once and for all phenomenon and are therefore\ninsignificant during an inflationary process.\n7 See: Kiguel and Liviatan; op.cit\n26 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nTable 11: Increases in Oil Prices and Electric Power Tariffs\nand Their Impact on Costs and Prices\nPrice Increases\nImpact on Oil 100% Power 150%\nProducer Prices Index 5.42% 3.68%\nConsumer Prices Index 5.90% 3.53%\nBased on calculations using the 1989 version of the Input/Output Table prepared by the\nEcuadorean Central Bank (described in greater detail above, in paras. 1.33 to 1.39).\nConclusion\n2.17 Given constraints on external borrowing and the fact that under-remunerated\nprivate deposits led the public sector to hold public debt, the Ecuadorean Government relied on\nmoney creation as the principal method of financing its deficit. This led to higher inflation rates.\nWithin the controlled Ecuadorean economy, these high rates of inflation resulted in negative real\ninterest rates. These in turn implied increasingly high returns in the informal economy which\neventually became pervasive. All of this served to erode the tax base, increasing the deficit,\nleading to more money creation, initiating a vicious circle. The elimination of oil and power\nsubsidies should break this vicious circle and restore a virtuous one.\n2.18 Subsidies led to mis-allocation of resources and rent seeking and risk-averting\nbehaviors. In order to avoid severe cuts in public spending, adjustments have been progressively\nshifted onto the external sector (with large external arrears since 1987), then onto the private\ndomestic sector (when in 1988-89, the stabilization policy tried to cut private domestic and\nfinancial credit, to enable financing of the fiscal deficit) and last, in 1990-1991, onto the low-to-\nmedium income households, with declines in wages and salaries. However, these \"second-best\"\nadjustments are rather precarious and any relaxation in money supply conditions --even a minor\none-- could lead to explosive inflation. The only way inflation was kept below explosive growth\nrates was due to the decline in the domestic demand for money.\n2.19 Even the Central Bank could no longer sterilize money aggregates, since its\nmonetary policy functions are hampered by its fiscal role (half of the Bank's external debt is\nrescheduled public debt). At this stage. the burden of adiustment remains the domain of the\npublic sector. It is demonstrated that the elimination of oil and power subsidies will dramatically\neliminate the deficit and provide large fiscal surpluses. In the short run, inflation will be reduced\nby about 60%. In the long run it will definitely be cured. For every S/100 billion reduction in\nsubsidy, inflation will be reduced by 10.5% to 23.3% in the long term.\nElimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 27\n2.20 The welfare of low-income households and poor people was the primary cause of\nconcern of this study. The elimination of subsidies is implemented on a responsible basis: the\nhypothesis is that one-third of additional revenues are assigned to social spending. In fact, the\nremoval of inflation will provide low-income households with a more stable framework in which\nthey will be more productive, earn higher incomes, be ble to save (without having to pay the\n\"inflation tax\"), with better access to social services and to services needed to improve their\nhuman capital, thanks to additional resources (from higher energy prices) going to these activities.\n3\nPOWER:\nPERFORMANCE, RECENT DEVELOPMENTS,\nNEED FOR POLICY AND SUBSECTORAL REFORMS\nIntroduction\n3.1 This section deals with the main issues faced by Ecuador's electric power\nsubsector. The first part of the section presents a diagnosis of the situation (technical and\nfinancial perforrmance, tariffs, and subsidies). The latter part of the section deals mainly with\ninstitutional issues and ideas and guidelines for institutional reforms (regulatory framework,\nderegulation, restructuring, privatization). The main recommendations of this section are: to\nadopt the tariff policy defined in the recently completed INECEL tariff study (funded under an\nongoing World Bank project); to separate regulatory from operational responsibilities, implying\nchanges in the structure and functions of INECEL; and to improve both planning and selection\nof investments.\nSector Overview\nInstitutional Framework and Regulatory Structure\n3.2 Ecuador's power sector is composed of a vertically integrated public utility,\nINECEL, responsible for bulk power generation and transmission and nineteen regional\ndistribution companies that serve their customers with bulk purchases and autogenerated power.\nOne of these distribution companies, EMELEC, serving Guayaquil, is owned by private foreign\ninvestors. The other 18, although organized as limited liability companies are owned by the State\neither through INECEL or regional governments. There are also a number of smaller facilities\nowned by municipalities and isolated power users. INECEL is also responsible for the operation\nof these latter facilities.\n3.3 The Basic Electrification Law of 1961 which defines generation, transmission,\ndistribution, and commercialization of power as a public service to be performed by a public\nentity, has led to the creation of INECEL, the Ecuadorean Electrification Institute. Placed under\nthe direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) and, thus, operating as an\nexecutive branch of the Central Government, INECEL is in charge of sector planning,\nPower: Performance, Recent Developments 29\ndevelopment, and coordination, and its Board assumes supervisory and regulatory functions,\nincluding the approval of rates applied to the distribution companies and the design of tariffs\ncharged at the retail level (with the exception of EMELEC's tariffs which are handled by the\nMEM). A Higher Council of Energy (CSE) established to develop and coordinate energy policies\nacross different subsectors has not been operative to date. There is also a National Energy\nInstitute (INE) which advises the MEM, but has no political leverage. INE should be reorganized\nand turned into the regulatory agency the sector lacks, or given the resources and the autonomy\nto perform its mandated role as an advisory body on energy policies.\n3.4 Before the inflow of large windfall profits that crude oil exports began to generate\nin the 1970s, INECEL's role had been restricted to that of a planning agency without financial\nresources. Thanks to its share in the country's oil revenues, INECEL graduated from a minor\npower company to a major public utility.\n3.5 During the 1980s INECEL became the sector's largest power generator, currently\naccounting for more than 85% of total electricity supply, operating the interconnected grid, and\ncontrolling, at least nominally, the regional distribution companies by dint of being their majority\nshareholder. On the other hand, as a public utility, INECEL is subject to numerous legal,\nadministrative, and financial restrictions, ranging from the dependence on budget allocations of\nthe Central Government and the approval of its budget by the Congress, to public sector\nprocurement procedures and civil service regulations that bog it down in its daily business.\nMoreover, INECEL is saddled with a Board of Directors representing several Ministries, the\nArmed Forces, and other stakeholders whose opinions and interests intrude on the Board's\nAgenda, limit the autonomy of the Executive Directors, and have a strong bearing on the utility's\noverall performance.\n3.6 INECEL's organizational structure was designed to be simple, but failed to work\nin practice. The weakness of administrative and operational direction in tandem with an ill-\ndefined allocation of duties have fostered the growth of functional areas and an overlap of\nresponsibilities. The general management is required to exercise its authority through a\nsubmanagerial unit that duplicates the decision-making process at the top of INECEL's hierarchy.\nA technical and administrative committee (Comite de Coordinaci6n T6cnico-Administrativo)\ndirectly attached to the general management did not really work. In addition, the management\nis stuck with a number of subordinate advisory and support units of which many are redundant.\nAnd the core operational areas, i.e. engineering and construction, system operation, and\ndistribution/commercialization, have been placed on an equal footing with lower-ranking tasks\nsuch as rural electrification and small hydropower development. Due to the proliferation of tasks\nand duplication of responsibilities, INECEL's organizational set-up has become a major obstacle\nto efficient power sector development.\n3.7 Unlike INECEL, the nineteen distribution companies have a corporate structure,\nwith the majority of the shares in 18 of them held by INECEL and the rest, by municipalities\n30 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n(only a tiny fraction of the shares is held by the public). The 19th, EMELEC (Electricity\nCompany of Ecuador Inc.) serving the city of Guayaquil, remains the only company owned by\nprivate investors. Its concession, though, expired in 1985. The Government had made the decision\nto buy out the company, and according to an arbitration decision it is required to pay US$43\nmillion for the assets and to assume EMELEC's debt to INECEL and Petroecuador.\n3.8 While the distribution companies are not exposed to Central Government\ninterference, they are controlled through the pro-forma majority of Board members appointed by\nINECEL. Defacto, however, the representatives of local/regional authorities and organizations\nexert a disproportionately strong influence on the companies' policies. As a result, the distribution\ncompanies' way of conducting business is driven not so much by corporate interests or system-\nwide considerations but by the political clout of local and regional pressure groups.\n3.9 In brief, the governance structure of Ecuador's Power Sector is a public monopoly\nwhich clears (within the Board of Directors) and executes Central Government policies, has the\noperational responsibility for bulk power generation and transmission, and is supposed to regulate\nand control the performance of its regional subsidiaries, the distribution companies, and to a\nlesser extent, EMELEC. The structure does not lend itself to a decision-making process which\nshould be driven mainly by sound corporate principles. On the part of INECEL, the proliferation\nof responsibilities, the weakness of managerial leadership, and limited financial leeway go hand\nin hand with a lack of accountability and financial discipline. While being subject to INECEL's\ncorporate and regulatory supervision, in practice, the distribution companies tend to self-regulate\ntheir activities in accordance with the political interests of their local/regional shareholders and\nclients.\nSector Development and Infrastructure\n3.10 Between 1977 and 1991 INECEL's installed capacity increased from 100 MW to\n1,676 MW. Its capacity expansion program has been geared towards the exploitation of the\ncountry's huge hydro potential of about 22 GW. By the end of 1991, INECEL's hydro power\nfacilities (located at three sites) accounted for a nominal capacity of 1,300 MW, with the\nremainder of 376 MW provided by thermal plant. On the other hand, since the early 1970s little\ngenerating capacity has been added to the plant operated by distribution companies, probably\nreflecting the superior economics of the large hydro plants built by INECEL. In fact, their\neffective capacity shrunk as an increasing share of the old plant became obsolete or inoperative.\nIn 1991, the distribution companies' effective capacity was estimated at 353 MW, of which 271\nMW were provided by thermal facilities, most of them owned by EMELEC. Including the plants\noperated by INECEL, the sector's total effective generating capacity is in the vicinity of 1,700\nMW, with hydropower accounting for 1,100 MW (as of early 1992). The core infrastructure of\nthe system also comprises 664 Km of 230 kV transmission lines forming a rectangular inner\nnetwork from which 138 kV lines with a total length of 1,162 Km spread throughout the country.\nThe distribution network comprises about 3,200 Km of 22-69 kV lines.\nPower: Performance, Recent Developments 31\n3.11 During the 1980s, total electricity consumption (=sales) increased at an average\nannual rate of 6.1 %. Sales slowed down in 1983/84 and 1988/89. Thereafter, consumption growth\nresumed and rose at an annual rate exceeding 8%. By 1991, residential users accounted for 39%\nof total consumption, followed by industry (31%), \"others\" (15.5%) and the commercial sector\n(14.5%).\n3.12 Between 1979 and 1989, the sector's gross generation rose from 2,718 GWh to\n5,770 GWh, while peak load climbed from 600 MW to 1,093 MW. During the same period,\nthermal generation increased from 2,040 GWh in 1979 to 2,950 GWh in 1982 and then fell to\n836 GWh in 1989. However, this trend came to a halt in 1990 when gross generation began to\nsoar by almost 10% a year. As gross generation jumped from 5,770 GWh in 1989 to 6,989 GWh\nin 1991, with peak load reaching the level of 1,246 MW, available hydropower capacity which\nat the end of 1991 expected to provide an annual average of about 6,500 GWh failed to match\neither the growth or load profile of demand. As a consequence, the system had to increasingly\nresort to thermal generating facilities that according to INECEL's forecasting and master planning\nshould have been mothballed by 1991. Indeed, between 1989 and 1991 thermal generation rose\nfrom 836 GWh to 1,919 GWh, with its share in total gross supply increasing from 14.5% to\n27.5%, essentially because of hydrological factors.\n3.13 Since additional hydro capacity is not likely to come on stream before 1995 and\ngiven the fact that the installed thermal plant, plagued by wear and tear and a neglect of\nmaintenance, provides unreliable backup capacity for meeting incremental demand, the system\nmay face severe capacity and energy constraints in the immediate future. Another factor\ncontributing to the reliability problems is the transmission network. Its current design is not\nsuited to safely match demand when thermal plants make up for a large share in generation.\n(There is also no reactive power control). The vulnerability of the sector became manifest in early\n1992 when the drought considerably reduced the level of hydroreservoirs, resulting in periodic\ndisruptions in electricity supply which were exacerbated by failures in the transmission system.\nMarkets\n3.14 At the end of 1991, the nineteen distribution companies served a total of 1.5\nmillion customers. Residential Users account for 86% of the connections and have a 38% share\nin total electricity consumption. On the other hand, with 13% of the connections, commercial and\nindustrial clients account for 45% of total consumption. Almost 90% of the customers are located\nin urban areas. The major load centers are in Guayaquil with 33% of the system's noncoincident\npeak demand, and Quito which contributes 25% to the system peak. Likewise, 61 % of total\nelectricity consumption can be ascribed to the cities of Guayaquil and Quito. Ten distribution\ncompanies have a market share of less than 2% each. Average monthly household consumption\nis highest in Guayaquil (177 kWh) and lowest in Sucumbios (92 kWh). Average monthly\nconsumption of industrial customers ranges from 18,000 kWh (Guayaquil) to 1,200 kWh\n(Sucumbios).\n32 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n3.15 System peak occurs in December, i.e. during the dry season which -relative to the\ndeveloped hydro resources- lasts from October to February. Industrial power demand is highest\nbetween July and October, and lowest between December and February. Residential and\ncommercial demand shows the reverse pattern. It is highest in the dry season and lowest from\nJuly to October. The daily peak occurs between 7 and 10pm. The residential users' peak\nresponsibility is 100%, while industrial customers account for 78%, and commercial users for\n70% of the daily peak.\n3.16 In 1991, bulk power transactions amounted to 81% of the electricity generated\n(net) by the sector. Only 0.4% of the sector's bulk power sales came from distribution companies\n(equivalent to about 2% of their net generation); the remainder was provided by INECEL. Almost\n99% of the bulk power purchases were undertaken by distribution companies; approximately\n0.2% (12.3 GWh) was exported to Colombia (from EMELNORTE), and the balance of about\n0.8% was not accounted for in INECEL's records. In any case, INECEL did not buy from\ndistribution companies, and the trade among distribution companies was minuscule.\nSector Performance\n3.17 During the 1980s, INECEL's ambitious investment program was financed mainly\nby earmarked oil revenues and, to a lesser extent, through foreign borrowing. The sector itself\nwas unable to contribute to the financing of the expansion program. Consequently, when the\ncountry's oil revenues became less plentiful, the sector encountered an increasingly critical\nsituation, leading to a delay in planned investments in power generation and transmission.\nINECEL not only experienced rising deficits, but was left with having to service a total debt of\nabout US$ 1.1 billion by 1992 (which has been assumed by the Central Government). Apart from\ncomparatively high operating expenses, the major factors contributing to INECEL's financial\nweakness were and continue to be (i) its inability to raise and keep tariffs at a level compatible\nwith cost recovery (although, with the measures applied on September 4, 1992, an important step\nwas taken toward a more logical tariff-setting policy), and (ii) the distribution companies'\nunwillingness to pay their bills. As the latter (and more so Government institutions) notoriously\nfall behind on payments due to INECEL and on average fulfill only 50% of their financial\nobligations, INECEL frequently resorted to swapping the companies' debt for equity, which may\nhave pleased the distribution companies, but entailed little financial relief for INECEL.\n3.18 By international standards, INECEL and its subsidiaries are overstaffed. The sector\nemploys about 10,200 persons. With 521 kWh a year, the volume of sales per employee is\nsignificantly lower than in comparable countries. Too much decision power is vested in\nINECEL's Board of Directors which represents diverse economic and political interests rather\nthan being a unit forging corporate strategies, leaving little managerial autonomy to the Executive\nDirectors. Many of the appointees representing INECEL in the Board of distribution companies\nare not overly interested in the performance and efficiency of the companies. Within INECEL's\nadministration, a major shortcoming has been that planning, which is given a high priority, often\nignores sound economic reasoning and lacks appropriate technical expertise.\nPower: Performance, Recent Developments 33\n3.19 Quality of supply seems to be deteriorating. For instance, voltage and frequency\nfluctuations are costly, particularly for industrial users. There is no economic dispatch, and the\ncentral dispatch facilities which are currently being installed will do little to improve the situation\nas long as shortages at the generation end as well as reliability constraints faced by the\ntransmission system tend to swamp merit order considerations.\n3.20 Another problem for the power sector, negatively influencing overall performance,\nis the high level of transmission and distribution losses. Total losses are on the order of 24% of\nnet power generation (4% in transmission and 20% in distribution, of which the largest share,\npossible around 13%, results from non-technical losses, that is, theft and administrative and\nbilling weaknesses). In developed countries, distribution losses range from 4% to 5% so that there\nis great potential to reduce these losses in Ecuador. ESMAP, with the collaboration of the\nEcuadorean power sector (and with cofinancing from Belgium and Switzerland) has recently\ncompleted a study on loss reduction which recommends investments of US$106 million whose\nyield varies between 30% (reduction of technical losses) and 12% (reduction of non-technical\nlosses). CAF (Corporaci6n Andina de Fomento) has recently provided a loan/grant of US$40\nmillion, with Belgian funds, to begin the recommended investments.\nSector Expansion Program\n3.21 A major dilemma of Ecuador's power sector is that while the implementation of\na number of expansion projects is behind schedule, demand is growing faster than expected.\nPaute Phase C, with a capacity addition of 575 MW, was supposed to be operative at the end of\nthe 1980s, but came on stream only in November 1991. The construction works of the multi-\npurpose project, Daule Peripa which were planned to start in 1988 are still not complete. As a\nconsequence, the 130 MW of the hydro component are not likely to be available before 1997.\nA second 230 kV transmission line from Paute to Guayaquil was planned and should have been\ncompleted at the same time as Paute C but has still not been built. This is why generation at\nPaute is limited to 820 MW out of an installed capacity of 1075 MW. A project aimed at the\nrehabilitation of 49 thermal plants that are owned by distribution companies and could provide\na total of 129 MW, is being delayed because of a lack of finance. Finally, the Paute-Mazar\nproject (180 MW) located upstream of the Paute hydroplant is reported to be in the design stage\nsince 1987. The project would help stem the sedimentation of the Amaluza reservoir, and\nincrease the Paute plant's storage capacity which currently is limited to five days of operation.\nHowever, conclusive studies on the technical feasibility and economic viability of the project do\nnot exist yet. Finally, since the Paute watershed already accounts for about 90% of the country's\nhydropower capacity, the risk of drought-induced shortages could become even greater than it\nis today.\n3.22 The sector total investments scheduled for the 1990s amount to about US$2.9\nbillion, of which 63% are accounted for by proposed capacity additions. Also, INECEL reckons\nthat, at the turn of the century, an additional one million customers will be connected to the grid.\n34 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nIn view of the sector's financial difficulties and the resulting backlog of investment activities,\nnone of the proposed projects is likely to materialize on time. For that reason the recently\ncompleted tariff study has revised INECEL's master plan of 1989 to obtain a more realistic basis\nfor calculating long-run marginal costs (LRMC). The least-cost expansion plan favored by the\nstudy begins in 1997 and calls for the installation of a gas turbine (85 MW) in October 1997, the\ncompletion of San Francisco (210 MW hydro) in November 1997, and the comnmissioning of\nChespi (167 MW hydro) in November 2,000, assuming that until 1997 demand can be met with\nthe existing plant plus the capacity additions scheduled for the period 1992-1996. It seems,\nthough, that the picture drawn by the tariff study is still optimistic. The revised capacity\nexpansion strategy is most likely to be thwarted by financial realities. And if electricity demand\ncontinues to grow at the rates observed in the last two years, shortages will become pervasive\nin the short-to-medium term (i.e. within the 1992 -1996 presidential period). Higher tariffs since\nlate 1992 (see below) will hopefully dampen demand growth.\nTariffs\n3.23 According to the Basic Electrification Law, electricity tariffs are subject to the\napproval of INECEL's Board of Directors; they should reflect costs and provide the sector with\nan adequate rate of return on investment. In practice, though, tariffs are fixed by the Board on\npolitical grounds with little regard to economic considerations. Based on the fallacy that as a\npublic service the provision of electricity can defy economic reasoning, pricing of electricity has\nbecome a political matter. The policy imperative has been to serve as many consumers as\npossible with as much electricity as is available, without letting them know what costs they incur.\nThings went well as long as the Central Government was able to invest huge amounts in a small,\nbut rapidly growing sector run by a public utility whose sales revenues covered its operating\ncosts. However, low tariffs encouraged excessive consumption, rendered the sector financially\nweak, and failed to generate extra revenues needed to sustain the reinforcement and expansion\nof supply facilities that the Government found increasingly difficult to finance.\n3.24 The most recent increase in tariffs took place on September 4, 1992, together with\nan increase in domestic oil prices and those of other publicly-supplied goods and services. The\ntariff increase of September 1992 initially reduced to 150 kWh the amount of monthly\nconsumption whose tariff is to remain frozen and tied to the increase in minimum wages. Shortly\nthereafter, however, this level was set again at 200 kWh. This freeze applies to the first 200 kWh\nof monthly consumption of all residential consumers and is thus not a particularly progressive\nsocial measure. Overall, however, the increase was significant, resulting in a 66.3% increase in\nthe average tariff. The increase is more fully described in the table below, as well as the marginal\naverage cost per consumer class.\nPower: Performance, Recent Developments 35\nTable 12: Average Tariffs by Consumer Class\n(US$/kWh)\nSeptember 1992\nMargi.

DC = Demand Charge\n3.25 During the 1980s, electricity users by and large paid between S/34 and S/51 per\nkWh (in prices of 1991), in spite of four major attempts INECEL made to raise and keep tariffs\nat a higher level. The next to last significant rate increase took place in 1989 when the price for\nbulk supplies doubled and retail tariffs on average rose by 50%. The increase was highest for\nindustrial customers and lowest for residential users. Also, since January 1989 until September\n3, 1992, prices for both wholesale and retail transactions were increased by 3% a month (about\n40 % a year), with the exception of the first 200 kWh/month of consumption, which face\nautomatic rate increases tied to the minimum wage. In real terms, however, the impact of the\nmeasures gradually lost momentum as inflation continued to eat up the adjustments in nominal\ntariffs. Moreover, since the increases in residential tariffs lagged behind the sector average, the\nwedge between residential and nonresidential rates became larger. Between 1988 and 1991 the\nratio of average residential to average industrial rates fell from 0.8 to 0.5 (while costs of service\nare usually in the reverse ratio) but in September, 1992, this ratio rose to 0.74.\n36 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n3.26 Tariffs for bulk purchases from INECEL are composed of a per-kW charge for\nsubscribed capacity and an energy charge. There is also a penalty on capacity drawn in excess\nof the contracted amount of kWs. While these rates apply uniformly to all distribution companies,\na discriminatory scheme of energy discounts has the effect that the companies' average costs of\nbuying electricity from INECEL can vary considerably. The rationale for the discounts is to\n(cross) subsidize companies that are placed at a disadvantage in terms of location, the number\nand composition of customers, etc. However, since the undiscounted bulk purchase tariffs cover\nonly a fraction of INECEL's supply costs, the subsidies' impact is to increase INECEL's\nfinancial losses. As of July 1992, the capacity charge imposed at the subtransmission level (138\nkV) amounted to S/2,980/kW/month, while energy was sold at an average of s/56/kWh. The load\nfactor relevant to the transmission level under consideration is about 0.54. Hence, the distribution\ncompanies on average paid s/32.16/kWh (0.021 US$/kWh) or less, depending on the size of the\ndiscount. For comparison, INECEL's tariff study of March '92 estimates that the average costs\nof bulk power supplied at the subtransmission level amount to s/94.5/kWh, equivalent to 0.0636\nUS$/kWh (at a rate of exchange of s/1,500/US$). As of September 1992, the bulk charges were\nS/127,3/kwh (US$0.0707/kWh at an exchange rate of S/1800/US$).\n3.27 The tariffs charged at the retail level vary by customer class. Residential\nconsumers pay a fixed charge up to 20 kWh/month, and are subject to increasing block rates if\nmonthly consumption exceeds the threshold of 20 kWh. In July 1992, the average rate paid by\nresidential customers was s/50.87/kWh (0.0339 US$/kWh). Industrial customers face a multipart\ntariff schedule that includes a demand charge and declining block rates. On average, they were\nbilled s/59.61/kWh, equivalent to US$0.0397/kWh (as of July 1992). Commercial customers are\nsubject to either a two-part tariff comprising a demand charge and an energy rate, or an\nincreasing block schedule, with a flat rate for a consumption level of 20 kWh/month or less. A\nsimilar scheme applies to Government institutions. In July 1992, commercial users without\ndemand charge on average were charged S/68.02/kWh (0.0453 US$/kWh, at a S/1500/US$\nexchange rate) and S/74,44 (US$0.0496) for user with demand charge. As of September 1992,\ntariffs for users with contracted capacity were as follows: commercial users were charged\ns/139.51/kWh (US$0.077/kWh) and government institutions s/129/kWh (US$0.072, at a exchange\nrate of S/1800/US$). Special rates apply to water pumping, public lighting, and some large\nconsumers such as the refineries. Also, in some cities, notably Quito, the monthly electricity bill\npresented to final consumers often includes a separate fixed charge for fire protection services\nand a garbage removal fee are assessed as a percentage of electricity consumption.\nPower: Performance, Recent Developments 37\nSubsidies\n3.28 In July 1992, the total subsidy accruing to electric power consumers totalled\nUS$223.4 million (nearly 2% of GDP of 1991). In September 1992, after the increase in tariffs,\nthe total subsidy was cut to about U$104.8 (less than 1% of GDP) or may be a little bit less, as\nconsumers, especially those who are no longer subsidized attempt to reduce their consumption.\nIn fact, large residential consumers (those using in excess of 1500 kWh/month), commercial\nconsumers with a demand charge, government institutions and public lighting are no longer\nsubsidized and contribute to covering part of the subsidy accruing to households, commercial and\nsmall enterprise (handicrafts) users without demand charge.\n3.29 Most of the financial burden arising from subsidies granted to electricity users is\ncarried by INECEL. Under the current tariff regime (with the tariffs in force until September 3,\n1992), INECEL forgoes at least US$0.043 per kwh supplied to the distribution companies\n(compared to a tariff system for bulk purchases that would reflect the costs incurred by INECEL).\nOn the other hand, since the distribution companies buy electricity at US$0.021/kWh or less and\non average sell for US$0.036/kWh, their margin is in the vicinity of US$0.015/kWh. Depending\non the type of customer served, the companies' average costs (covering losses in the distribution\nsystem, operating expenses, and depreciation, but not including the costs of bulk supplies) range\nbetween US$0.005 and US$0.020/kWh. Hence, the distribution sector as a whole does not seem\nto experience major financial difficulties (even if the companies were to pay INECEL promptly,\nwhich they don't). The lion's share of the subsidies enjoyed by electricity users is reflected in\nlosses by INECEL, with the Government acting as the financier of last resort. The situation since\nSeptember 3, 1992, has improved considerably. the average tariff for the distribution companies\nwill be around US$0.0361 1/kWh, compared to US$0.0653 which is the estimated average tariff\nfaced by consumers.\n3.30 Most of the subsidies (i.e. 57.4%) benefitted residential customers. If subsidies are\ndefined as direct economic costs to the power sector that customers do not pay, then the\nhouseholds connected to the grid received in July 1992 a total subsidy of US$10.7 million. On\nan annual basis, this amounts to US$128 million. The subsidy per connection increases with the\nnumber of kWh consumed. While households using not more than 20 kWh/month are subsidized\nby US$0.44/month, the subsidy is US$91/month if the monthly consumption exceeds 1,000 kWh\n(July 1992 figures). However, the cumulative subsidy is highest for households that consume 300\nkWh/month or less. These households account for 58% of total residential consumption and 91%\nof the total number of consumers, receiving 64% of the total subsidies to the residential sector.\nthis situation has changed since september 4 as follows: the subsidy received by households\namounts to US$8.8 million/month, which works out at US$105.6 Million a year; the households\nconsuming less than 300 kwh/month account for 75.6% of the subsidy to the residential sector\nand those consuming between 1000 and 1500 kwh/month are subsidized by US$24 instead of\nUS$91 as before. Moreover, it was estimated that the highest consumption households (above\n38 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n1500 kwh/month), provide a cross subsidy of US$61.6/user/month which accounts for 3.8% of\nthe total subsidy for the residential sector.\n3.31 Industry was the second largest recipient of subsidies supported by the tariff\nsystem. In July 1992, it received about US$3.4 million, which works out at US$41.2 million a\nyear. Next is the commercial sector which accounts for US$26.7 million a year, followed by\npublic lighting and water lifting with an annual subsidy of US$12.4 million and US$6.5 million\nrespectively. The annual take of Government institutions is worth US$6.3 million, and small\nmanufacturers receive US$2.1 million a year (all figures are extrapolated from July 1992\nestimates). This situation has changed since September 3, 1992, as industry no longer receives\na subsidy. This sector contributes to financing the subsidy for residential, commercial and\nhandicrafts users (without demand charge). Government institutions, commercial users with\ndemand charge and public lighting are also transferring cross subsidies to the above- mentioned\nusers.\n3.32 The table shown below summarizes the distribution of the subsidy component of\nthe present tariff regime by customer class, compared to the July regime. The economic costs of\nthe subsidies are likely to be higher due to deadweight losses (e.g. the adverse impact that the\nfinancial drain has on sector operation and development) that the above figure does not take into\naccount. In particular, government transfers to the sector do not made up for the financial losses\nentailed by the subsidies. At any rate, the size of the subsidies as well as its distortionary\nimpacts, place a burden on the power sector and the economy at large that is neither defendable\nnor sustainable.\nPower: Performance, Recent Developments 39\nTable 13: Subsidy Component of Electricity Tariffs by Consumer Class'\nAverage Share in Total Total Share in\nSubsidiary Subsidiaries Subsidiaries Total cons\n(UScents/kWh) (%) (USS thousand) (%)\nJuly 92 Sept 92 July 92 Sept 92 July 92 Sept 92 July 92\nResidential 5.7 4.7 57.4 100.8 10685 8805 43.1\nCommercial without DC 4.3 0.3 9.1 1.5 1702 130 9.1\nCommercial with DC 1.4 -0.9 2.8 -3.0 524 -263 6.6\nHandicraft 5.3 1.7 0.9 0.6 174 56 0.1\nIndustrial 2.3 -0.0 18.4 -0.6 3433 53 27.6\nGovt.

Economic growth and social progress\nwill call for additional electricity supplies, improved services, the expansion of service areas, and\ncost-efficient utility performance. The sector, however, needs to be assisted to accomplish these\ntasks.\n3.34 Sector institutions are exposed to government intervention and political pressure\nexerted by various interest groups. Legal and administrative impediments limit the sector's\noperational autonomy and have fostered the growth of bureaucratic structures and inefficiencies\nwithin the electric utilities. The utilities are heavily dependent on Government funds, tend to\nmisallocate resources, and are unable to generate and raise the finance needed to sustain and\nexpand the sector's services. Their tariff system is hostage to an ineffective redistribution policy\nthat has never been assessed in terms of its financial (costly) and allocative (regressive)\nimplications. And corporate responsibility, true market discipline, and accountability are criteria\n40 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nthat did not really guide the behavior of sector institutions. As a result of these shortcomings,\ninvestments in essential infrastructure are lagging behind the growth of demand, service quality\nis deteriorating, and the sector has neither the incentives nor the resources to redress the\nincreasing imbalances.\n3.35 Ecuador's electricity sector is stuck with problems that piecemeal policy changes\nare unlikely to resolve. What is needed are far-reaching reforms that reshape the sector, redefine\nits responsibilities, and establish a revised system of regulatory control and supervision. The key\ningredients of the reform package will be a new tariff policy and a new institutional framework.\nPolicy Reforms\nTariffs\n3.36 While electricity appears to be a homogeneous good, it in fact has multiple\ndimensions, depending on where, when, and how it is generated or used. For that reason, pricing\nof electricity becomes a complicated task. In particular, the cost of generating a kWh and the\nvalue it has to a consumer may vary during the day, month, or year. Moreover, since electricity\nin general cannot be stored or retraded, generating capacity must be sized to meet peak demand,\neven though the peak may last only a short period of time. While the load (level of demand)\nchanges over time, generating plants differ in terms of (unit) capital and operating costs. On\neconomic grounds, it is therefore expedient to dispatch the generating facilities in accordance\nwith the time profile of demand. This minimizes costs, but minimum costs will change over time.\nAlso, the costs of a kWh vary with the level of reliability at which it is supplied. The higher the\nlevel of reliability, the more expensive is supply. Finally, transport of electricity entails losses,\ndepending on the technical characteristics of the transmission and distribution lines, the transport\ndistance, and the flows through the lines. As is argued below, an optimal tariff system should\ntake all these factors into consideration.\nOptimal Tariffs\n3.37 Electricity tariffs can be designed to meet a number of objectives, the most\ncommon ones are:\n(a) Economic efficiency\n(b) Equity\n(c) Cost recovery\n(d) Transparency and ease of implementation. A brief summary of this topic is given\nhere, with a fuller, more rigorous treatment given in Annex 1.\nEconomic efficiency is required to maximize welfare, And economic theory states that welfare\nmaximization calls for short-run marginal cost (SRMC) pricing. Efficient prices must clear the\nmarket at every point in time for every location. Such prices properly reflect the costs of\nPower: Performance, Recent Developments 41\ngenerating and supplying electricity, taking into account the load to be met, the merit order\ndispatch, transmission losses, and the design limits of the system. Stated differently, they inform\nconsumers of the different costs that the system incurs to serve their demand. Moreover, since\nefficient prices have to clear the market, they are just equal to what consumers are willing to pay\nfor being supplied with electricity.\n3.38 In addition, efficient prices are equitable in the sense that they provide consumers\n(or suppliers) with no incentives to retrade or recontract electricity among themselves. Even\nthough this is a strong argument, different views may be held. Equity considerations aside, there\nare other problems with SRMC-pricing. One is that efficient prices may not enable the supplier\nto recover total costs. This happens when marginal costs are below average costs. While non-\ndistortionary government transfers could, in theory, solve this problem, in practice, an insolvent\nutility that depends on government transfers lacks incentives to operate efficiently. Also, in\npractice it is difficult for a government to raise revenue and to subsidize without distortion.\nMoreover, a utility that is required to operate like a non-profit organization will find it difficult\nto raise funds from non-government sources or, as the case may be, attract private investors\nwhenever this is needed or desirable. Finally, electricity prices that support commercial goals,\nbut are not fully congruent with the ideal of economic efficiency, tend to outperform tariff\nsystems that (at best) are designed to be economically efficient, yet provide the utility with no\nincentives (rewards and penalties) to operate in an efficient way. So convincing is the case that\ncan be made for SRMC-pricing on theoretical grounds, so difficult is its implementation in\npractice. So in most circumstances, particularly when demand and supply are not very diversified,\nthe pursuit of a perfectly efficient pricing policy is not worth the effort.\nResponsible Electricity Pricing\n3.39 Responsible electricity pricing is a compromise between the requirements of\neconomic efficiency and the actual capabilities to meet these requirements. As has been outlined\nbefore, there are a number of constraints and difficulties that beset the task of devising electricity\ntariffs. Responsible pricing takes account of these factors. First and foremost, electricity tariffs\nshould be structured so as to inform users about the costs they impose on the system. Second,\nprices should be financially viable, i.e. allow the utility to at least recover its costs. Third, the\ntariff system should be compatible with commercial goals. In particular, if the power sector has\nto strive for scarce financial resources, the regulatory framework should permit utilities to\ngenerate positive returns. Fourth, the tariff system should be vertically desintegrated. This means,\nprices should provide separate information about costs attributable to the consecutive services\n(generation, transmission, etc), that the sector performs in supplying its customers. Fifth, the tariff\nsystem should be horizontally desegregated. This postulate says that if it is feasible to diversify\nservices in terms of price, customers should be given the opportunity to choose among these\nservices.\n42 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n3.40 The last two requirements often are subsumed under the term \"unbundling of\nservices\". In the context of Ecuador's electricity sector, unbundling is an issue relevant to the\ndivision of labor between power generation, transmission, and distribution. Since services and\ncosts vary across the country's franchised distribution areas, the companies should be given\ndiscretion to custom-tailor their tariffs to the conditions under which they operate, subject, of\ncourse, to regulatory supervision. This would result in a dual tariff system: One for bulk power\ntransactions between the generation and transmission complex and its wholesale customers (the\ndistribution companies and, as the case may be, large industrial users), and one that applies to\nthe retail level and reflects the different infrastructural and economic characteristics of the\ndistribution areas. Once a coherent system of tariffs for bulk supplies is in place (differentiated\nby load, voltage level, and location), the distribution companies should be held responsible for\nselecting a mix of bulk supplies and own generation that serves their customers at least cost.\nRetail tariffs that take account of regional differences may appear to be discriminatory. However,\nthis will not be the case as long as tariff differentials are a mere response to the diversity of\ndemand and costs (rather than a means of reaping monopoly profits).\nTariff Design\n3.41 INECEL's new tariff study was completed in March 1992. Its implementation\n(which this report strongly endorses) could make an important contribution to restoring the\nfinancial health of the sector and enhancing the incentive framework of its operators and\ncustomers. The study is based on a careful examination of short- and long-run system-costs,\noperational features of the system, and the profile of loads. It calls for an increase in the level\nand a change in the structure and number of rates applying to wholesale and retail transactions.\nThe suggested changes in the tariff system are directionally correct and would bring about\nsignificant improvements on how electricity is generated, transmitted, distributed, and used. In\nparticular, the proposed tariffs vary by time-of-use, reflect seasonal variations of supply and\ndemand (although some dilution of seasonal cost differences occurs), and account for line losses\nand the costs of transmission and distribution services. Compared to the rates which were in\nplace in july 1992, the new system would have increased average tariffs by USc3.0/kWh for\nindustrial users, USc3.5/kWh for commercial users, and USc5.7/kWh for residential customers.\nAnnex II presents a critical evaluation of the recently completed Tariff study and of its\nimplementation and Annex III presents a method to more exactly calculate average incremental\ngenerating costs (when the additional required information becomes available), which the Tariff\nStudy merely approximates.\nPolicy Reforms: Institutional Issues, Ideas and Guidelines for Power Reforms\n3.42 There are several factors exerting a negative impact on the efficiency, management\nand financial performance of the electric power sector. Among these, excessive politization,\nhighly constraining administrative procedures, insufficient tariffs, INECEL's load of operational\nand regulatory activities, and strong trade union activity have been specially noticed. Most of\nthese factors are due to an inadequate and obsolete legal framework and regulatory setup. Many\nPower: Performance, Recent Developments 43\nhave been analyzed in the earlier part of this section. This second part of the section on electric\npower will analyze the main institutional issues and make very general recommendations on how\nto go about introducing institutional reforms.\nExcessive Politization\n3.43 Excessive politization is obvious in operational and decisional matters and in the\nfact that INECEL's Board of Directors is mainly comprised of ministers (or their representatives).\nINECEL's top-level management is unstable because the general manager is replaced after each\npresidential election and at times, even more frequently. Likewise, some managerial positions\n(executive director) are assigned to persons outside the institution, that is, not by internal\npromotion which may imply a lack of \"esprit de corps\" in the management team's group loyalty.\nMoreover, management team instability is harmful to cohesion, co-responsibility in making\ndecisions and to their ability to make difficult and necessary medium- to long-term choices (with\nshort-term decisions favored). Although the Board of Directors is chaired by the Minister, certain\ndifficult decisions are trapsferred to the President of the Republic. This occurs in institutional\nstructure matters, in the case of substantial investments and in the setting of tariffs.\nHighly constraining administrative procedures\n3.44 As a State institute, all the administrative proceedings characteristic of public\nbodies apply to INECEL. These are, as in most countries, too numerous, long, tedious and\ncomplex and totally unadapted to the operation of companies or institutions active in commercial\nand competitive industrial markets. For example, expenditures exceeding US$40,000 must be\napproved by the Board of Directors. The chain of administrative procedures characteristic of all\npublic entities, such as that of the Procurator's office and the Comptroller's office apply to\nINECEL. As the electric power industry certainly plays an essential strategic role within a\ncountry's economic and social development it must, therefore, implement missions of general\ninterest. Pursuing these general interest objectives is perfectly compatible with a dynamic and\nefficient company management. Whatever INECEL's status, (i.e. private or public) it would be\nadvisable to distinguish between the procedures applicable to public entities evolving within an\nindustrial and commercial market (such as the electric power companies) and those which are not\n(for example, hospitals or ministries).\nInsufficient tariffs\n3.45 Tariff setting is the aim of a more in depth study which has just been completed\nand is commented on in more detail in the preceding section. Suffice it to say, insofar as it\nconcerns this section, that tariffs in force during August 1992 did not reflect the costs of electric\npower generation, transmission and distribution. This situation stems from the Government's\npermanent refusal to adjust tariffs to costs and their evolution. The structural insufficiency of\ntariffs to cover costs (direct and indirect, including a fair and equitable reward on invested\n44 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\ncapital-fair rate of return-) on a permanent basis produced catastrophic consequences for the\noverall economy of the country, for INECEL and for the distribution companies. With the tariff\nincrease of September 1992, however, the situation has improved markedly although further tariff\nincreases are needed to reach LRMC.\nOverlap of operational and regulatory activities undertaken by INECEL\n3.46 In addition to its operating activities of generation, transmission, distribution and\nmarketing (through 18 private limited liability distribution companies of which INECEL is the\nmain shareholder), and EMELEC which is a privately owned distribution company, INECEL\nperforms a series of other activities in keeping with the Basic Electrification Law (Ley Basica\nde Electrificaci6n), which range from the development of rural electrification, to the construction\nand engineering of the installations of the National Interconnected Grid, as well as the purchase\nof materials and spare parts for the distribution companies (E.E.). In addition, by order of the\nsame Basic Electrification Law, INECEL assumes the dual role of judge and defendant and\ncarries out other activities such as approving the tariffs to be applied by distribution companies.\nThis duality does not constitute a sound management policy in general, nor in this specific\nsituation. The systematic blockage of electric power prices by the relevant politicians to whom\nINECEL's Board of Directors refers tariff-setting decisions, provokes the well-known double\nreaction: an explosive deficit for INECEL and incomplete payment for the power sold by\nINECEL to the distribution companies, even though INECEL is their majority shareholder. There\nis no doubt that combining operational and regulatory activities within INECEL is\ncounterproductive for the electric power subsector as a whole, as well as for power users.\nPowerful impact of trade unions and low efficiency\n3.47 The extremely powerful position held by the trade unions should be mentioned.\nRegardless of the classic arguments, the problem of trade union intervention in management, the\nimpossibility of firing labor, overstaffing and low productivity are, among others, factors which\nmust be emphasized. The role of these organizations should be correctly appreciated so that they\nmay be focussed on within the framework of the restructuring measures that need to be\nimplemented. In addition to the many factors leading to inefficient sector management mentioned\nabove, power transmission losses (line losses) and commercial losses, reach unacceptable levels\nand reflect important inefficiencies.\nInadequate legal framework\n3.48 The Political Constitution of the Republic, the Basic Electrification Law, and the\nOrganic Law of Financial Management and Control (Ley Orgdnica de Administraci6n Financiera\ny Control -LOAFYC) form a very rigid framework that establishes the supply of electric power\nas a private function of the State, conducted through INECEL. However, INECEL is a public\ninstitution subject to regulations and controls that impede it from carrying out the tasks entrusted\nto it. The power conceded to INECEL to create private limited companies has not resolved this\nPower: Performance, Recent Developments 45\nbasic issue because these limited companies (18 out of the 19 distribution companies) are created\nby the public sector (virtually 100% government-owned) and are therefore subject to the\nmonitoring and control system applicable to public institutions (that is, LOAFYC), any way.\nBasic Ideas on Restructuring\n3.49 This section aims to formulate ideas that could lead to proposals on how to\nrestructure the institutional and regulatory system within which the Ecuadorean electric power\nsector evolves. Due to the short time available and the fact that a complete restructuring study\nis about to be started under a World Bank funded project, only a few comments are presented\non the nature of essential changes in the operational and regulatory framework.\n3.50 In outline, restructuring concerns the redefinition of INECEL's activities and role,\nits legal status, the regulatory framework, growth of competition, improvement of quality of\nservice and relative autonomy of the distribution companies. Likewise, legislative changes must\nbe made to enable any company or private individual to perform any of the electric power\nactivities currently reserved for the State. INECEL's restructuring essentially consists of removing\nits regulatory prerogatives and transforming it into one or several companies. INECEL's\noperational activities (essentially power generation and transmission) must be removed from what\nis a public institute dependent on the Ministry of Energy and Mines. INECEL must be subjected\nto the discipline of the market whether it becomes one or several private company(ies) or one\nor several mixed public/private company(ies), depending on the speed of its transfer from public\nto private ownership and according to the degree of privatization and decentralization wished to\nbe achieved.\nThe electric power industry, an industry like any other\n3.51 Regardless of the degree of privatization, the sector's managerial or operating\ncomponent must be directed and managed, in its entirety, under management rules identical to\nthose of classic private commercial or industrial companies (normal corporate rules) operating\nin market economies. Within this context, contracts between sector companies must be controlled\nby private law, not public law, as must the relationship between all types of suppliers (equipment\ngoods, investments or repairs, and services).\nRelationship between the electric power distribution companies (EE) and INECEL\n3.52 The relationship between the electric power distribution companies (except\nEMELEC) and their major shareholder, INECEL, is not as clear as it should be between a\nshareholder and the private limited company in which it holds shares (the electric power\ncompanies are legally private, limited companies). Moreover, as INECEL has neither managed\nto consolidate its position as majority shareholder nor its political capacity to control the electric\npower companies, it has tried to do this by using managerial and bureaucratic measures, which\n46 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nthe permanent financial dependency of the electric power companies on INECEL forces them to\naccept. This has resulted in the creation of huge obstacles to the efficient management of the\ndistribution companies. Although relations between the distribution companies, INECEL as power\nsupplier and INECEL as shareholder, are perfectly compatible under a normal private company\nsystem, the aforementioned situation necessitates the complete separation of the relationship\nbetween distribution company and shareholder, and between distribution company and the agency\nsupplying bulk power.\nReciprocal debts between INECEL and the distribution companies\n3.53 Often, when INECEL implements work or sees that work is carried out for the\ndistribution companies, the value of the work undertaken is often presented as a capital\ncontribution from INECEL to the distribution companies (since INECEL is usually unable to\nobtain cash payment for this work). INECEL may also request the distribution companies to\nundertake work for it or they may make purchases for INECEL. Although, the distribution\ncompanies pay the contractor directly they are often not reimbursed by INECEL and they\ncompensate, by not paying INECEL for all their power purchases. These \"self-compensations\"\nare unsound and do not constitute proper management. INECEL needs to document reciprocal\ndebts and compensations between itself and the distribution companies. This document should\ndetail the financial obligations incurred by each party, stating the amounts paid, the amounts\ncompensated and naturally, the expenditures.\nInvestments of the Distribution companies\n3.54 The distribution companies must be able to implement thermal and hydro\ngeneration facilities within their own areas and for their own needs. The tariff-setting formula\nfor bulk power supplied by INECEL should promote competition and optimized dispatch between\nINECEL's generating facilities and the distribution companies. Up until now, however,\ndistribution company investments have been decided by their respective Boards of Directors\nlargely without considering any analytical or economic criteria.\nOpening up the distribution companies to other shareholders\n3.55 The distribution companies should be able to count on industrial clients as\nshareholders (for example, the Chamber of Industry), so that they are involved in financing new\ngeneration units, rehabilitating current power stations or other investments. In addition, the\ncurrent system of small, private companies (private limited companies) should be maintained\nbecause their privatization could be relatively easy through the sale of shares. Moreover, tariffs\nshould differ according to distribution area so that the technical, economic and financial\nconditions (for example, quality of service, geographic dispersion, structure of client) of each one\nof the 19 distribution companies can be taken into account. This would enable the distribution\ncompanies to offer their clients a mixture of autogenerated power and power purchased from\nINECEL that minimizes costs (see Annex 1, paragraph 8).\nPower: Performance, Recent Developments 47\nINECEL's focus on generation and transmission activities\n3.56 The preceding paragraphs state that INECEL performs many activities which\nunnecessarily complicate management of the Institute and corner all the financial means available.\nFor this reason, INECEL should focus on the generation and transmission of electric power. This\nfocus will also facilitate the privatization process. In addition, the generating activity must be\nopened up to independent generators. Independently generated power should be purchased by the\nsystem under conditions predefined by the regulator (for example, avoided cost). A dispatching\ncenter must be created to coordinate the system's integral operation and all the units belonging\nto the different operators (generation, distribution company and independent producers).\nInstitutional reforms and restructuring\n3.57 The Ecuadorean electric power sector's institutional situation was very briefly\nreviewed in the preceding paragraphs (more detailed information is found in the reports prepared\nas background to this study). Several areas have also been mentioned where substantial changes\nneed to be made. In fact, the aforementioned ideas for reform make up a general framework,\nwhich is common to many countries, and which Ecuador will need to follow if restructuring the\nelectric power sector is to be considered seriously. This general framework for evolution from\na totally state-owned sector (with its numerous failings as mentioned in the preceding pages),\ntoward a decentralized, de-monopolized, dynamic (technically and financially), partially or totally\nprivate electric power sector requires moving through the following stages, which are often\nalmost simultaneous:\na. Legislative changes to abolish the State monopoly (which is presently complete\nin Ecuador) and to specify the basic rules of the electric power industry,\nseparating it from the regulatory system (existing or about to be created);\nb. The creation of a regulatory agency whose characteristics and attributes are\ndefined in the basic electrification law (basically the establishment of cost-based\ntariffs or perhaps, \"incentive\" regulation). This regulator could be in charge of the\nwhole energy sector (electricity, oil and other sources);\nc. Reorganization and restructuring, which often includes total or partial privatization\nof state electric power entities (companies or pseudo-companies).\nSeveral issues which must be borne in mind when starting on the road to reforms,\nin keeping with the general framework described here, are mentioned in the following paragraph.\nSpecific recommendations, as well as the sequence of actions and mechanisms to be used, will\nbe defined in a more detailed study which is about to be started with funds provided through an\nongoing World Bank project.\n48 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nAn autonomous and highly competent regulation\n3.58 Reform of the Ecuadorean regulatory system is the keystone of the reform\nproposals for the entire electric power sector. This section lists a number of general principles\nregarding the status and prerogatives of the regulatory agency. These principles need to be\nadjusted to the specific prevailing condition of the power industry before being finalized in detail\nand implemented. While there is no universal truth in these matters, the general principles\nmentioned below have been found to have general applicability and they are suggested by the\nBank to its member countries in a recently published Policy Paper on the Power Sector.\n3.59 Regulation should be removed from INECEL's responsibilities and should be\nmanaged by an independent and highly competent agency (called the regulator). \"Independent\"\nmeans that the regulator cannot be part of or depend on the Ministry of Energy and Mines or any\nother governmental office of that same level. \"Highly competent\" implies that the regulator's\npersonnel must be hired on the basis of technical, economic and financial qualifications, and offer\nskills or qualification which will enable the agency to implement its regulatory activities with\nutmost technical credibility, completely independently from the electric power sector companies\nand to conduct and/or supervise studies necessary for the overall discharging of its\nresponsibilities. Responsibility for the daily running of this regulatory agency could be entrusted\nto a high-ranking official who would try to obtain the greatest possible efficiency, be as\nindependent as possible from political pressures and have rapid access to the highest levels of\nthe State (either the Presidency or the Council of Ministers). Moreover, the regulator should have\nits own independent budget. This budget should ensure that the cost of studies (whether\nconducted by agency personnel or contracted out), as well as the regulator's operating expenses\nare covered. To constitute a dynamic agency, the total number of personnel should be limited by\nlaw.\nDescription of the regulator's main duties or prerogatives\n3.60 The main duties of the regulatory agency should be:\na. To approve and maintain current and appropriate tariffs to enable the electric\npower activities to be separated in parts (see Annex I on tariff setting), which\ncould potentially be managed by different public and/or private companies (that\nis, which enable an \"unbundling\" of services). For example, this regulatory\nagency could have had performed a tariff study such as the one recently\ncompleted, and could now be in charge of putting it into practice.\nb. To promote the entry of private capital into all areas of the electric power industry\nand to establish a contractual framework to enable the commercial interchange of\nelectric power between all the companies (public and/or private), throughout all\nphases of the electric power industry, thus allowing specialization and an increase\nin the industry's efficiency.\nPower: Performance, Recent Developments 49\nc To direct the indicative planning of generation and transmission projects of\nnational importance (to plan, but to be willing to consider the alternatives\nproposed by the companies).\nd. To advise, counsel and explain the basic issues and options of energy policy to the\nhighest national authorities.\nPunctual and/or specific issues\nINECEL: the specific problem of the Directorate of Engineering and Construction, the\nDirectorate of Small Hydropower Stations and the Directorate of Distribution and\nMarketing (DISCOM).\n3.61 This first Directorate has a large staff (on the order of 700 persons). The current\norganization needs to be flexible because most construction workers are unemployed due to a\nlack of financial resources (for building new installations). In 1980, demand was forecast to\nincrease by 10% annually and although it is currently 6%, the personnel hired to implement the\nneeded projects are still employed by INECEL. A reduction in force is unavoidable although a\nbasic capacity must be maintained for the eventual resumption of projects. Redundancies could\nalso occur in other areas of INECEL, such as the Directorate of Small Hydropower Stations\nwhich implements small-scale studies and projects (and employs 37 persons), and the Directorate\nof Distribution and Marketing (DISCOM, which employs 260 persons) which manages relations\nwith the electric power companies in which INECEL is a shareholder, a relationship which would\ntend to disappear with the independence of electric power companies. While this is mentioned\nhere under \"reforms\" it is really merely a cost-cutting measure which INECEL should have taken\nlong ago.\nDialogue with the Trade Unions\n3.62 As the importance of the unions is obvious, dialogue with them on the proposed\ninstitutional and regulatory reforms is unavoidable. Although dialogue is essential to improve the\nprospects of the restructuring measures, selecting with whom and when to hold the discussion\nshould be decided carefully. As demonstrated by recent experience in Bolivia, where the public\nsector union's considerable influence almost made the country ungovernable, sector restructuring\nhas to involve discussion with the trade unions and a reduction in their intervention in\nmanagement.\nConclusions\n3.63 This report strongly suggests that a number of structural reforms should be\nintroduced as soon as possible. The main points of the restructuring of the Ecuadorean electric\n50 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\npower industry and several reasons for why these structural reforms are urgent, are outlined\nbelow:\na. Establishment of an autonomous, highly capable and experienced regulatory\nagency.\nb. Restructuring and eventual privatization of the electric power industry, that is, the\ntransformation of INECEL and the electric power companies into normal, ordinary\nindustrial companies (whether private, public or mixed).\nc. The specific problem of INECEL's engineering and construction department (and,\nto a lesser extent, DISCOM and the Small Hydro Stations Directorates) should be\nsolved.\n3.64 The main reasons justifying the urgency of the thorough reforms mentioned in this study\nare:\na. that there is very low motivation and productivity throughout the system;\nb. that the sector's financial deterioration persists;\nc. and that the current political context is especially suitable for the introduction of\nthorough reforms.\n3.65 Nevertheless, a social and political consensus on the urgency of these reforms has to be\nforged and the way of carrying them out, transparent and honorable, must be agreed. The studies\nnecessary to arrive at the concrete modalities of implementation must also be conducted.\n4\nHYDROCARBONS\nIntroduction\n4.1 The section that follows deals with a number of issues in the hydrocarbons\nsubsector. Since this study was mainly a short/medium term pricing and strategy study, coverage\nof the hydrocarbons subsector is not complete. For example, while some aspects of upstream\nlegislation (exploration and production) are mentioned, they are not analyzed in depth. On the\nother hand, the marketing of domestic kerosene (kerex) is dealt with in detail (a study of just this\nmatter is attached as Annex V). The largest investment being considered, enhanced recovery in\nthe Petroamazonas fields appears, under scrutiny, to be unnecessary and uneconomic.\nInvestments proposed in downstream operations are reviewed critically and most are found to be\nuneconomic, and more importantly, not needed at this stage. This chapter will cover:\n-a general overview of the hydrocarbons subsector;\n-a brief discussion of the price policies with emphasis on LPG and kerex (domestic\nkerosene);\n-a discussion of the marketing of kerosene and suggestions for improving it;\n-deregulation/privatization of the oil industry (i.e. continuation of reforms in Petroecuador);\n-reserves and explorations;\n-discussions/analysis of issues in refining and other downstream activities.\nOverview\n4.2 In exploration and production, the lion's share of the investments needed should\nbe done through foreign companies. Petroproducci6n and Petroamazonas should only invest in\ndiscovered fields in their production areas, or near them. Also, Petroecuador should open to\nforeign companies the exploration of areas that have a good potential, which it has reserved to\nitself. These areas present good prospectivity of finding light crudes which are needed to move\nthe heavier ones.\n4.3 If the foreign private companies start producing the crude (heavy) from their\nrecently discovered reserves, total potential production in 1995 could reach 340,000-350,000 B/D\n(based on 320,000 B/D in mid 1992). This will require an investment of about US$750 million\nby these companies over the next 2-3 years. Optimistic forecasts\n52 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nby private oil companies and Petroecuador suggest that an output of 400,000 B/D may be\nattainable in 1996 or 97.\n4.4 To encourage foreign investments in exploration and production, it should be taken\ninto account that the fifth round of exploration (which discovered the heavy crudes that are soon\nto be produced), suffered some setbacks:\n-The crude price a posteriori was lower than what was expected.\n-The quality of the crude was lower than what was expected (15-21\u00b0 API rather\nthan 290 API, like the Oriente crude).\n-The fields that have been discovered were smaller than expected.\n-Since then, environmental aspects have acquired more importance and will cause\nhigher costs in exploration and production (as well as in processing and\nutilization).\nThis means that the profitability of the companies is lower than was expected and that\nmaybe the government would need to help the companies (the \"R\" factor is now unrealistic)\nprovided it remains economic to exploit these heavy crudes. Since the economics of these\ndiscoveries are marginal, the narrow margin must be split carefully between the state and the oil\ncompanies otherwise one of the parties may end up with a loss-making situation (which would\nnot be sustainable). While companies naturally take this into account when they negotiate\ncontracts, in this case there were several factors which gave unfavorable outcomes and so, the\neconomics of these discoveries are marginal. Also, the contractual arrangements (contrato de\nprestaci6n de servicios) are not attractive enough and complicate the relationship between the\ncompanies, Petroecuador and the State and cause double taxation in some cases. This report\nstrongly recommends the adoption of different arrangements such as Production Sharing\nAgreements, concessions or direct negotiations with oil companies. This will require legal\nchanges but not constitutional ones (because the crude can still be owned by the State).\n4.5 As for investments, the analysis of several recent studies suggests that neither the\nbig upstream nor downstream projects that are being discussed are really justified. The primary\nand secondary recovery methods currently being used in the Shushufindi and Sasha fields are the\nmost appropriate and show a very good recovery of the crude petroleum in situ. Therefore, a\ndecision on whether to move to tertiary (or enhanced) is no longer so urgent. In any case, the\ntraditional exploration methods are still, for now, the most economic way of adding to reserves\n(rather than tertiary or enhanced recovery).\n4.6 As for refining, present capacity could be sufficient (even more so if better price\npolicies give greater incentive to conservation) until the end of the century (with small\ninvestments in Esmeraldas). It is too early to talk about a new refinery for heavy crudes (whose\nproduction has not started yet) and whose production by the end of the century might only reach\n40,000 B/D. Also, nothing at present suggests that domestic refining of this crude will be the best\noption (in, say, 1998). The actual production of Oriente crude could stabilize and it will continue\nHydrocarbons 53\nto exceed the intemal needs of the country for quite some time. In addition, recent studies made\nfor the processing of heavy crudes have been carried out by institutions interested in the\nexecution of the projects being studied (and this creates a conflict of interest). The best option\nfor refining would consist of closing the refineries on the Peninsula and consolidating all refining\nat Esmeraldas.\n4.7 Small investments to add to the capacity of the transecuadorean pipeline could be\njustified, but after having studied the possibility of using the existing pipeline spur to Colombia.\nThe expansion of the terminal in Balao to receive bigger carriers (Very Large Crude Carriers -\nVLCC) to export crude to the Far East could also be justified. This investment could become less\nurgent if Ecuador were to recover nearby markets, like Peru and Chile who need to import\nOriente crude to optimize refinery runs (Peru) or because crude output falls short of needs\n(Chile).\nPrice Policies\n4.8 Ecuador is one of the few countries that until recently continued to subsidize\npetroleum products heavily and indiscriminately. The elimination of the subsidy to petroleum will\nallow more rational use of the resource; give incentive to conservation; eliminate a good part of\nthe contraband trade and allow the State to substantially reduce the fiscal deficit and the\nconcomitant monetary emission which causes the stubborn inflation that besets the country. In\naddition, this price policy would allow an increase in public expenditure in the social sectors (as\ncompensation to poor households for the higher prices and tariffs for goods and services supplied\nby the State).\n4.9 Because Kerosene is marginally cheaper than LPG in economic terms and because\nit can be purchased in small quantities (whereas LPG is \"lumpy\"), it is proposed in this study that\nkerosene should be the onlv socially important fuel. However, its price should never have fallen\nto the ridiculous level of S/60/gallon (US$0.04/gallon in mid 1992). In the price structure that\nis to be established, it should not be too cheap in relation to diesel and it should be sold freely\nto avoid the monopolization of which it is the object right now and which is resulting in final\nprices in excess of S/600 per gallon,8(before the September price increases). Therefore, a\nsubstantial first step increase in the ex-refinery price (for example, from S/60 to S/900- 1000 per\ngallon) could mean little or no increase to the final consumer, provided that the product is sold\nfreely. Its free marketing (at a higher price) through gasoline service stations and other\nfranchised dealers would eliminate these rents thus allowing the State to have higher revenues\nand consumers, a better access to the product. The price of kerosene should be brought close to\nits economic price (around S/1142 per gallon) over a short period of, say, one year. For LPG,\nits domestic price could also be brought to its economic price (S/750/Kg) in three steps, say:\n8. Resale in secondary markets occurs at S/.250 -400 per gallon. This was before the Sept.\n92 price increase. Since then, final prices rose to about S/1300/gallon. See background paper\non the marketing and pricing of kerosene prepared for this study and attached as Annex VIII.\n54 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n-First: from S/80 to S/200 per Kg (this was done in Sept. '92);\n-Second: from S/200 to S/500 per Kg\n-Third: from S/500 to S/750, over a 6-8 month period.\n4.10 The price of other derivatives (ex-refinery) could simply be their CIF values.\nDomestic prices ex-refinery could also be set to cover refining costs, assuming that the price of\nthe crude for domestic refining were increased to its economic price (FOB value, US$16/barrel).\nAs computed from available information, the value resulting from this latter option is still inferior\nto the CIF value of the products because of two reasons: i) refining cost are underestimated and,\nii) the setting of the price of crude at its FOB value for domestic refining -and setting ex-\nrefinery price at the CIF level -provide protection (equivalent to freight costs) to domestic\nrefining.\nMarketing of Kerosene (KEREX)\n4.11 The drastic fall in domestic consumption of kerex, from 33.8 million gallons in\n1991, is a result of both the restricted marketing system itself and persistent low prices for\nliquefied petroleum gas, a fuel that, in addition, is more consumer-friendly. On the grounds that\nkerex is a fuel mostly consumed by low-income sectors, it has been highly subsidized.\nParadoxically, however, these sectors are getting only a low share of this subsidy. The current\nmarketing system involves distribution of kerex directly to communities and public health\norganization, etc., by Petroecuador. In the cities, kerex is sold to the final consumer in traditional\nmarkets (ferias libres) and at specific outlets.\n4.12 Rationing at the distribution outlets, however, is widespread and in some cases,\nthe sale of kerex is limited to a maximum of two gallons per person. Because of this rationing,\nthere are long lines of organized groups involving the whole family, including children, who\ngenerally buy the product mainly for resale. Final prices (before the September increase) vary\nbetween S/250 and S/650 per gallon and maybe even more, depending on the remoteness and\nisolation of the place. In rural and marginal areas this product is even traded in bottles, at prices\nfar exceeding the above. These prices should currently be much higher, since the reference price\n(that of diesel 1 for sale to industry) amounts to S/1460 per gallon since September, instead of\nthe previous S/630. The September 92 price increase has widened the price differential between\nthe two products and thus increased the incentive to divert kerex.\n4.13 Indeed, as the price of diesel 1 is considerably higher than the price of kerex, even\nbefore September 3, a black market had developed supplying industry, small-scale dishing and\nother productive activities with kerex at a price substantially lower than that of diesel 1 (or diesel\n2). Ample evidence from Quito's traditional markets has confirmed this situation. For example,\nonly 45% of available kerex at these outlets is sold to the intended beneficiaries, to industrial\nusers (if all of it had gone to household use) and the remainder is diverted and sold to substitute\neither diesel 1 or diesel 2. Likewise, on the basis of Petroecuador's sales and the number of\nhouseholds consuming this fuel, it was found that only 9% of sales can be justified as residential\nHydrocarbons 55\nconsumption. Although the number of households consuming the product in 1990 amounted to\nonly 13% of that of 1982, consumption in 1990 was 40% of that of 1982. In 1990, average\nkerex consumption amounted to 90 gallons per month per household, which is exaggerated\ncompared to an estimated average real consumption of no more than 10 gallons per month per\nhousehold. Obviously, 80 gallons are diverted to other (industry?) users.\n4.14 The main conclusion is therefore that the beneficiaries of the subsidies are\ngenerally not low-income consumers but the middlemen, as well as the final users of kerex who\nacquire it cheaper than diesel 1 (or diesel 2). Two substitute oil products, kerex and LPG, are\ncurrently being subsidized for household use. This is not advisable: sound pricing policy, would\nreserve kerex for low-income groups with a lower price compared to LPG, which should reach\nits economic value in the short run. Moreover, the margin between the price of kerex and diesel\n1 needs to be reduced. The new kerex price could be based on the average of what consumers\nare actually paying. The lower margin would discourage diversion. Likewise, its marketing\nshould be decontrolled so that it can be distributed again from service stations, with more outlets\nin marginal areas of cities and rural areas, to discourage monopolization and enable the product\nto reach final consumers at the lowest possible cost. In rural areas, where LPG has not fully\npenetrated, the possibility of broadening the marketing of kerex is quite good, in order to\nsubstitute grasses, straw and fuelwood, reduce ecological damage and lower the time cost of\ngathering traditional fuels. Similarly, in many suburban areas with low income households,\nkerosene is considered a good substitute for LPG, provided its supply became more reliable.\nOnce kerex prices are increased, compensatory social actions should be accelerated, among which\nthe supply of more efficient kerosene stoves should be given priority. The so-called \"regular\"\ngasoline could be discontinued when kerosene supply became more reliable and efficient stoves,\nwidely available.\nSocial Impact\n4.15 A key element of this study is its attempt to measure the impact of the use of\nenergy on low-income households. A survey was carried out (August-December 1992) about the\nuse of energy in poor urban and rural households. The survey also attempts to investigate\nconsumer attitudes in relation to different forms of energy and their prices. The survey would\nalso try to measure the consumption of goods and services with a high energy content (such as\ntransport) and the impact of higher prices on family budgets. Survey results are presented in a\nforthcoming companion report.\n4.16 The felt needs of the marginal populations are also being investigated as well as\nthe delivery and support system that serve them. The idea is that a part (say, a third) of the\nadditional public revenues could be spent on social programs that directly support the welfare of\npoor populations (rather the present situation where the subsidy to LPG and power and other\npetroleum derivatives accrue much more to the upper and middle classes than to the poor). This\naffirmation now has rigorous empirical support in Ecuador (as it does in other countries) on the\nbasis of results from the survey mentioned above.\n56 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nDeregulation/Privatization of the Hydrocarbons Subsector\n4.17 Whatever the type of restructuring that Ecuador ultimately choses for its hydrocarbons\nsubsector, it will need to take steps similar to those mentioned below:\nA. Amend the Hydrocarbons Law by:\na. Eliminating state monopolies over downstream activities;\nb. Establishing that economic costs must be used as a basis for pricing policy\ndecisions;\nc. Setting strict but clear environmental guidelines;\nd. Modifying exploration and production legislation towards other\ncontractual forms (such as production sharing, joint ventures, directly\nnegotiated contracts, like for example, in the case of marginal fields) and\nto give more attention to the heavy crudes that have been discovered\nrecently as well as to natural gas.\nB. Establish a system of pricing and taxation which allows the deregulation of\npetroleum and gas activities by clearly separating costs from taxes. (i.e. creating\na producer price e.g at the refinery gate).\n4.18 At the first stage, and to start with the more urgent matters, the crude for internal\nrefining would be valued at its economic costs (FOB price). This would generate additional\npublic revenues of US$240 million per year, plus US$98 million per year from the increase in\nexports. This amount was calculated on 1992 consumption assuming a price elasticity of 0.20 and\nassuming that crude production costs would not increase materially as a result of this measure.\n4.19 In a second stage, the ex-refinery prices would be set at their CIF levels, (except\nfor fuel oil which would have a FOB price because it is exported). In a third stage, after the\nelimination of the monopoly of the State in \"downstream\" activities, storage, transport and\ndistribution would be liberalized. In a fourth stage, the import of refined products would be\nfreed, so that the refineries would have to compete against the importers (who could also be final\nconsumers). This could push refineries to be more efficient or face loss of market.\n4.20 As for exploration and production, the role of the private sector has been\npredominant until recently. Companies like Petroamazonas and Petroproducci6n are relatively\nefficient (this is not the case for downstream activities). In any case, the process of\ncorporatization of Petroecuador should be completed. This would mean that Petroamazonas and\nPetroproducci6n would become independent, limited liability corporations (S.A.) initially state-\nowned but whose shares could be eventually sold. To make these companies stronger, high cost,\nmarginal fields could be heaved off and transferred to private investors who would operate them.\nHydrocarbons 57\n4.21 What is now the Petroecuador head office would cease to exist and its functions,\ncould be divided between:\na. Those that should be handled directly by the State, including the promotion of\nexploration and production by oil companies which could be assigned to a\nregulatory entity (which could be the same one that regulates the electric power\nsubsector).\nb. Operational functions (to the extent there are any) would go to the subsidiaries.\nIn addition, while some of Petroecuador's subsidiaries or affiliates have been\nmerged, over the objection of a previous Bank economic mission (June/July 1992) this report\nsuggests that in order to prevent declines in productivity and preserve the ease of privatization,\nPetroamazonas and Petroproducci6n should not be merged. In the same way the Esmeraldas\nrefinery could become an independent company (S.A.), buying its crude at the FOB price and\nselling its products at their CIF value (the State would directly intervene if it wanted to subsidize\nany product). If a system such as this were adopted, it is likely that the old refineries (ex Anglo\nand Repetrol) of La Peninsula would not be able to compete and would have to close (maybe\nthey should have been closed earlier, as soon as they reverted to the State in 1990).\nReserves and Exploration: Current Situation\n4.22 The amount of reserves has always been a controversial issue because figures\ndiffer according to how they are assessed and, above all, who assesses them. The officially\naccepted figures are those of the National Hydrocarbons Directorate (Direcci6n Nacional de\nHidrocarburos), which are more conservative than Petroecuador's assessment and less optimistic\nthan those of oil companies and international organizations.\n4.23 It can now be reasonably be said that the country has 1.5 billion barrels of light\noil (290 API) out of about 2 billion barrels in proven reserves. Of this, about 70% are in\nPetroecuador's oil fields. Also, about 400 million barrels of heavy crudes (15-20\u00b0 API) have been\ndiscovered by international oil companies in the last 5 years, as a result of the service contracts\nfor hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation (These are included in the 2 billion reserve figure).\n4.24 In view of the limited public financial resources available, foreign investment will\ncontinue to be essential, especially since, during the last decade, exploration results from service\ncontracts were relatively modest. Discovered reserves, on the order of 400 million barrels, are\na great deal lower than the goal of 1 billion barrels which was decided when contracting began.\nMoreover, the quality of crudes found is considerably lower than expected, and the estimated\ntime between the start of exploration and incorporation of production has doubled from five to\nten years. Production costs will be between US$8 and US$10 per barrel, compared with present\ncosts of US$2-3 per barrel. At current, relatively low oil prices (late cy93), the economics of\nthese discoveries will be, at best, marginal.\n58 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nProspects\n4.25 Because no service contracts were signed during the preceding government's\nadministration, there will be a four-year delay in the search for new reserves. Increased reserves\nwill come almost exclusively from those found through foreign investment, since oil exploration\nis a highly risky activity and the use of limited public resources for this purpose is not desirable.\nMoreover, the current form of contracting should evolve toward concessions, direct negotiations\nor perhaps the classic Production-Sharing Agreement (PSA). This could help accelerate the\nexploratory process due to better acceptance by international oil companies.\nProduction: Current Situation\n4.26 Current national oil production, close to 315 thousand barrels per day, is one of\nthe highest recorded so far and will most likely be maintained, or even increased, within the next\n5 years. Ecuador's oil production basically comes from the Amazon region. In 1992, average oil\nproduction amounted to 300,000 barrels per day and 315,000 barrels per day in March 1992, of\nwhich 98% was accounted for by Petroecuador (73% Petroamazonas and 25% Petroproducci6n)\nand 2% by foreign companies (City and Oryx). Private, foreign company output will continue\nto rise with production from the new fields of other international companies, but it is estimated\nthat until 1996 at least 85% of production will come from Petroecuador's fields.\nProspects\n4.27 To maintain Petroecuador's current production and incorporate new oil fields, it\nis imperative to implement planned investments, especially in Petroamazonas' fields. In addition,\nit is estimated that the companies that have made commercial discoveries (MAXUS,\nOCCIDENTAL, ORYX, ELF and TRIPETROL) will have to make investments of no less than\nUS$750 million within the next 3 years to incorporate production of about 40,000 barrels per\nday. These investments could amount to US$1.2 billion during 1992-1996, if the potential of\nabout 70,000 barrels per day is to be attained. To achieve this, security will have to be ensured\nand the problems currently besetting private oil companies will have to be solved.\n4.28 The production of heavy crudes needs to be carefully analyzed to determine\nwhether the optimistic production forecasts made by the company Maxus, to the south of Bloc\n16, can be achieved. Moreover, it has to be borne in mind that heavy crudes can only be\nproduced and transported while light crudes are available to dilute them. In view of the\nuncertainty concerning the volume of heavy crudes that the aforementioned company will\nproduce, the overall solutions proposed for the incorporation of these crudes in the oil industry\n(specially with respect to pipeline transport, refining and exports) will have to be carefully\nanalyzed. In fact, the domestic refining of these crudes could be left for the future, since with\nprices nearer to economic levels, the current refining capacity could perhaps be sufficient until\nthe close of the decade if it is carefully complemented with the import of certain products.\nHydrocarbons 59\nProduction Scenarios\n4.29 Three production scenarios have been proposed.\na. The low-production scenario assumes that production of the different onstream\nfields would continue to decline if there are no further investments in them. This\nyear's (1992) production would fall to 291,000 barrels per day; this trend would\npersist and by 1996 production would be down to 236,000 barrels per day and by\n2000 down to 181,000 barrels per day.\nb. The average-production scenario assumes that the next Government would\ncontinue with the investment scheduled in Petroecuador's fields, which includes\nthe allocation of resources to incorporate several fields and international\ncompanies making investments of the order of US$750 million to incorporate\nbetween 20,000 and 43,000 barrels per day within the next few years. Under this\nscenario, production of 305,000 barrels per day in 1992 would increase to 331,000\nbarrels per day in 1995 and fall to 314,000 barrels per day in 1996.\nc. The high- or optimistic-production scenario assumes that the resources needed for\ninvestments in producing fields would be allocated; that investment needed to\ndevelop all discovered fields would be made; and that international companies\nwould incorporate all the reserves found with an investment of US$1.2 billion, and\nthat their optimistic forecasts would be achieved. According to this scenario, the\ncurrent year's production would average 318,000 barrels per day; production\nwould rise to 377,000 barrels per day in 1994 and to 407,000 barrels per day in\n1996, then fall to 312,000 barrels per day and 130,000 barrels per day in the years\n2000 and 2010, respectively.\n4.30 The average-production scenario is the most likely, although it may be a bit\nconservative and many observers believe that a peak output around 400 000 B/D is possible in\nthe latter part of the decade, especially if increased output can be obtained, through increased\ninvestments in the fields now operated by Petroamazonas. Slightly more detail is shown in the\nfollowing Table (and in Annex Tables 18-20).\n60 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nAverage Oil Production Scenario\n(thousand barrels per day)\nField 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996\nPetroamazonas 225 223 221 218 209\nPetroproduction 76 66 65 65 57\nP.

With a relatively low investment of US$148 million, a discounted cash flow of\nUS$ 1.355 billion can be produced and obtained, during the 33 years assessed, that\nis, an investment-return ratio of 1/9.\nHydrocarbons 61\nb. The field's current production could be maintained at 100,000 barrels per day until\n2003, thereafter declining to 34,000 barrels per day toward 2024.\nc. It is forecast that the accumulated production between 1972 and 1992 (700 million\nbarrels) and between 1992 and 2024 (893 million barrels) will be close to 1.6\nbillion barrels, exceeding Texaco's previous estimate of reserves by 250 million\nbarrels.\nd. Another 130 million barrels could be recovered in the decades after 2024 until the\nfield becomes uneconomic.\n4.35 The results of this study are based on production systems where the field operates\non its own energy (primary recovery) and the installation of an artificial water-injection system\n(secondary recovery), and reveal the exceptional characteristics of the Shushufindi field oil\ndeposits, where over 50% of the oil trapped underground could be recovered.\n4.36 In view of Texaco's concern over injection of C02 (tertiary recovery),\nPetroecuador established a Coordination Unit to conduct, along with Scientific Software, the\ntertiary recovery studies applicable to the field and to study the availability of C02 in the\ncountry. These studies are being carried out and will be completed soon. These studies have to\nbe completed and the performance of the fields should be carefully observed, to confirm whether\nthe studies are as reliable as they are believed to be.\n4.37 To implement tertiary recovery, however, huge investments are required.\nAccording to Texaco figures, the Pilot Plan (to assess whether this method operates\nexperimentally) alone would cost on the order of US$80 million. In addition, Petroamazonas\ncalculates that, for an assessment in the area of well P-80 (C02 producer), US$1 million would\nhave to be invested in seismic lines and at least US$4 million to drill an additional well.\nProspects\n4.38 Preliminary results indicate that secondary recovery could be more economical\nthan tertiary recovery. Although tertiary recovery, technically speaking, could achieve 6-9% more\nproduction than combined primary and secondary recovery, the estimated investment and\noperating costs, based on current price levels, would postpone the decision about tertiary recovery\nin Shushufindi by several years. When tertiary recovery eventually proves to be technically and\neconomically feasible, international bids could be called, whereby the winner would sign a\ncontract in keeping with laws prevailing at that time.\n4.39 The preceding pages have especially focused on the supply-side of oil, that is,\nfactors such as legislation, exploration and development investments etc. The demand-side\naspects, that is, factors affecting consumer behavior (prices, taxes, availability and substitution\npossibilities, etc.), have been touched on in the preceding paragraphs and in the earlier sections\n62 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\ndealing with prices and subsidies. The pricing policy for oil products has been identified as the\nmajor cause of sector problems and should therefore be modified. Moreover, amendments should\neventually be made to the Hydrocarbons Law, as follows:\nElimination of the monopoly exercised by Petroecuador (and its affiliates) in oil\nactivities.\nThe valuation of oil at its economic cost, that is, its opportunity cost (the value\nof a barrel or gallon of oil sold at the best price that can be obtained).\nA more thorough regulatory framework dealing with the environmental aspects of\noil exploration, production and industrialization to mitigate the negative impact of\ntheir activities on the environment.\nEnvironmental Aspects\n4.40 Oil production, although crucial for Ecuador, should not necessarily damage the\nenvironment. There are techniques and procedures that are not prohibitive although they do entail\nsome costs that would prevent damage. Also, regarding environmental impact, the Hydrocarbons\nLaw has been negative because it has not included the costs for avoiding, alleviating or repairing\nenvironmental damage in the price base. Likewise, maintaining very low prices for domestic\nconsumption promoted rising exploration and production (and the environmental problems this\nimplies) and has resulted in very high consumption (Chile, with a per-capita GDP more than\ntwice that of Ecuador, uses only 25% more oil) contributing to air pollution in cities as well as\nsoil and water pollution in production, refining, storage and transport areas. Once oil products\nare sold at their economic price, (that is, a price that fosters conservation and rational use of the\nproduct), efforts should be focused on repairing the damage incurred and establishing the\nstandards to avoid a relapse (which would be more costly, due to the higher prevailing prices)\nPetroleum Refining and Related Issues\nConclusions\n4.41 Present refining capacity in Ecuador is insufficient to meet the demand forecast\nby Petroecuador. If finance for expanded refining capacity is limited, the shortfall in supply\ncould hypothetically be made up by either importing products, or importing a synthetic crude oil\nto be processed at La Peninsula refinery instead of Oriente crude as at present. However,\ndemand management options (pricing, energy conservation) have not been considered and future\ndemand may well be over estimated.\n4.42 The economics of refining in Ecuador should be relatively favorable, since both\ncrude and product transport costs will lead to higher gross margins (in excess of $2/Bbl overall)\ncompared to the U.S. Gulf. Operating costs in Ecuador should in total be no higher than in the\nHydrocarbons 63\nU.S., while capital investment costs should be only about 5% higher than the U.S. But refining\nmargins are volatile everywhere, and the economics of new capacity should be considered\ncautiously. Considering the Petroleum Sector as a whole, investment in the upstream (exploration\nand production) is likely to warrant first priority.\n4.43 Ecuador's refineries are deficient in conversion capacity, with a \"conversion index\"\nof about 24 compared with an average of 56 in the U.S. (Ref. Oil and Gas Journal, May 4, 1992).\nWith a surplus production of fuel oil now and expected in the future, as well as the production\nof heavier oils in the eastern regions, more conversion capacity must be a priority if any\nexpansion can be justified.\n4.44 Petroecuador has commissioned several studies that were carried out mostly by\nBEICIP. The main recommendations are:\nTo commence expansion with the installation of a fluid cracker for vacuum gas\noil at La Peninsula, followed by a resid cracker at Esmeraldas at a future date;\nTo revamp Esmeraldas to maintain light product output when Oriente crude\ngravity increases.9\nThe number of cases studied by BEICIP were limited however, and did not fully explore\nthe option of abandoning refining at Santa Elena, combined with further expansion of Esmeraldas\nbenefitting from economies of scale and, possibly, Amazonas. These options are worth further\nstudy.\n4.45 As an interim measure, processing a synthetic crude at La Peninsula could be an\nattractive option, but the pricing terms of C. Itoh for a synthetic crude are unrealistic and would\nbe less advantageous than continuing to process Oriente.\n4.46 In the absence of good data on the extent of Ecuador's urban air pollution\nproblem, improvements to gasoline should be limited to provision of a low lead, high octane\ngasoline. Quito would best be supplied with a lower octane product than Guayaquil.\nRecommendations\n4.47 The recommendations for refining development should be reviewed in the light\nof overall energy policy issues, including product pricing, energy conservation, petroleum product\nsubstitution, and priorities for investment.\n9 Oriente gravity does not increase (i.e. API does not decrease). This happens only if the\nheavier crude output is blended with Oriente.\n64 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n4.48 Before proceeding with any proposed addition of conversion units at the La\nPeninsula refinery, the option of closing down refining operations at Santa Elena, with an\nexpansion of capacity at Esmeraldas, should be studied. The proposed modifications to\nEsmeraldas refinery to accommodate heavier crude oil could be justified if output of heavier\ncrude does grow (and refining it domestically is the best option) and should be implemented, so\nas to become operational in about 5 years.\n4.49 The feasibility of expanding Amazonas to a higher capacity conversion refinery\nshould also be screened, although the minimum scale (40,000-50,000 BPD) to make conversion\neconomic may be too large given the environmental sensitivity of the upper Amazon basis.\n4.50 The proposal to import a synthetic crude to be processed at La Peninsula refinery\nshould be followed up with negotiation for a more realistic price, and more detailed consideration\nof the synthetic crude quality. The economics of any such proposal must be based on gasoline\nand distillate products valued at import parity.\n4.51 Cost/benefit studies should be initiated to determine whether the marketing of\nhigher quality transportation fuels is justified. As an interim measure, BEICIP's recommendation\nto market a low lead, higher octane product could be implemented. The feasibility of supplying\nQuito and the Sierra with a lower octane gasoline than Guayaquil and the lowlands should be\nevaluated.\nBackground\n4.52 Ecuador's national oil company has since 1972 had the exclusive right to market\nrefined products throughout Ecuador, and has built up its refining capacity with the objective of\nfully satisfying local demand from domestic refineries, processing domestic crude oil. Since the\nexploitation of the Oriente oilfields in the 1970s, the country's most important refining center\nmoved to Esmeraldas with the construction of a 55,000 B/D refinery convenient to the export\npipeline, and convenient for the export of surplus heavy fuel oil. Debottlenecking measures,\ntaken in the eighties have increased Esmeraldas's throughput to 90.000 B/D. At present,\nPetroecuador is planning further expansion of the refining industry in view of continuing high\nrates of market growth. This growth in consumption may well slow as major changes in energy\npricing policies are being considered by the new government. (August 1992). Extensive studies\nhave been made by Petroecuador with the assistance of BEICIP. At the same time, considerable\nexpansion of the pipeline network has been made. A further factor in future refinery\ndevelopment is the fact that Ecuador's reserves of light crudes have not increased and that future\nproduction will be heavier as the heavy crudes to be produced in block 16 are added to the\nOriente crude mix. As an interim measure, Petroecuador is considering importing a synthetic\ncrude to be processed at the La Penfnsula refinery, to increase product supply prior to refinery\nexpansion. A study of this has been made by Petroecuador, with an internal report issued May\n1992. This section reviews the above studies in the context of Ecuador's overall energy situation.\nHydrocarbons 65\n4.53 Completely new refining centers have been proposed by the national company, e.g.\nat Pascuales to specifically serve Guayaquil. Feasibility studies have usually shown such projects\nto be economically unattractive. In general, a study of world refining expansion shows that most\ncurrent expansion is through adding to large, existing refineries. There are several reasons for\ndistributing refinery activity in several areas, rather than concentrating in a single plant. Supply\nis likely to be more secure, in the event of a major disruption to a refinery or pipeline such as\nan accidental explosion, sabotage, or earthquake.\n4.54 The development of an optimum refining and supply strategy is a very complex\nproblem involving the simultaneous optimization of refinery location, selection of crude to be\nprocessed, of refining processes, of transportation modes, and of product quality specifications.\nThis is most efficiently done by a comprehensive linear programming model, as was used by\nBEICIP. It must nevertheless depend to a large extent on forecasting of demand growth, and\ncrude and product prices. It must also depend on judgement decisions as to what options are\npermitted to be considered by the model. As discussed below, Petroecuador may have excluded\nsome economically attractive alternatives, either for deliberate policy reasons or due to oversight.\nThe option of closing the Peninsula refineries and supplying all product from Esmeraldas and\nAmazonas, expanded as required to balance demand growth, does not appear to have been\nexplored by Petroecuador. It would reduce refining overhead costs; increase economies of scale;\nand permit the maximum exploitation of the specific advantages of the two sites with good access\nto crude supplies from the eastern producing areas.\n4.55 The economics of refining in Ecuador will continue to be dependent refining\nconditions in the North American area, since both crude and product prices relate to prices in the\nU.S. Ecuador's gross refining margins should be higher than U.S. margins due to the lower\ncrude value and higher clean product value, but reduced somewhat by the lower value of heavy\nfuel oil exported. Considering Esmeraldas yields and current freight costs, this would indicate\na gross margin about $2.2/Bbl higher than an equivalent U.S. plant.\nEcuador's Refining and Supply Strategy\n4.56 The principal obiectives of the government related to refining are likely\nto be:\nTo assure a secure supply of petroleum products to the domestic market, at\nminimum cost;\nTo continue to develop the existing refining network, as an important part of the\nindustrial sector and to provide specialized fuels for other industries such as power\ngeneration and cement manufacture;\nTo add the maximum value to domestic petroleum resources;\n66 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n-To spread this development over several regions for logistical, social and\nsecurity reasons;\n-To supply products with qualities most suited to the specific needs of the country,\ne.g. for environmental reasons.\n4.57 Some major trends in world refining are:\n-Conservation efforts have slowed the growth of crude distillation capacity;\n-Reduced use of heavy fuel oil, as well as the trend to heavier crudes, has\naccelerated the growth of conversion capacity, i.e. to convert heavy fractions to\nlight fractions for mainly transportation fuels;\n-Most growth in the refining sector is now through the expansion of existing larger,\ncomplex refineries; while many small hydroskimming refineries (such as the\nPenfnsula ones) are being shut down, since few are economically viable;\n-Tough environmental standards are leading to major investments in plants to\nproduce higher quality fuels, as well as to control refinery effluent. These trends\nwill affect Ecuador's refinery development strategy.\nHydrocarbons 67\n4.58 Presently, Ecuador has three main refining centers:\nEcuador: Breakdown of Refining Capacity\nCapacity MBD Market*\nEsmeraldas 63.4 42.8\nPeninsula 28.9 55.0\nAmazonas 11.0 2.2\n100.0 100\nThe \"% Market\" refers to the area most logically\nsupplied by each refinery.\nThe Amazonas refinery is in the major oil producing region, which however only\nrepresents 2% of demand. The main advantage of this location is access to both crude and\nassociated gas. The gas can be used both as refinery fuel, and also as a source of hydrogen for\nthe treating of heavy oils. Also, the refinery could be integrated with heavy oil production, e.g.\nsupplying fuel for steam generation, or supplying diluents. Another advantage of this location\nis that the plant is integrated with a gas processing plant recovering natural gas liquids from\nassociated gas. These liquids are blended into gasoline and LPG products.\n4.59 The main disadvantages of this location are:\nThe distance to major market areas, and to labor and services required for refinery\noperation;\nThe difficulty of disposal of surplus residual fuel oil. Small quantities may be\nblended in the crude oil stream to be pipelined to the coast;\nIt's location in an environmentally sensitive region, the upper Amazon basin.\n4.60 The major advantage of the Esmeraldas location is its access to both the main\ncrude export pipeline, and to the port of Balao which facilitates both residual fuel exports and\ntransportation of products by tanker to other Ecuadorean ports. It is relatively well located to\nserve the Quito area by pipeline, and now can also serve Guayaquil by pipeline. With the largest\nand most complex refinery in the country, it is a logical center for further expansion.\n68 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n4.61 The location of refineries at Santa Elena was related to the early production of\ncrude in this region, dating from the 1920s. Currently, crude production in this region is below\n1,000B/D, so that crude supply proximity is no longer a reason for refining at Santa Elena. The\npresent La Peninsula refinery, made up of two separate plants, only operates as a topping plant.\nIn common with most simple refineries of this type without conversion capacity, the refinery is\nnot now profitable when crude and products are valued at opportunity cost. The location has the\ndisadvantage of a water shortage. On the positive side, it does have access to a port (with\nlimitations), and is reasonably close to the Guayaquil market. Also, it is now connected by\nproduct pipelines to both Guayaquil and Manta.\n4.62 Esmeraldas operating costs, quoted as $1.81$/Bbl by Petroecuador, appear\ncompetitive with average US. costs recently estimated to be $2.7/Bbl for an average refinery of\nsomewhat higher complexity than Esmeraldas. However, there are good reasons why costs at\nEsmeraldas may be underestimated.\n4.63 Based on figures extracted from the reports under review, the relation between\ncurrent refinery output and present and forecast demand are as follows:\nRefinery Product Surplus/Shortfall, MBD:\n1991 1995 2000\nGasoline -0.5 -2.8 -6.9\nDistillates 6.0 -0.0 -7.0\nFuel Oil 32.0 21.7 17.1\nLPG -6.6 -15.4 -22.3\nThe shortfall of clean products would indicate a need for about 20 MBD new\ncapacity by the year 2000. The shortfall in LPG relates to the low subsidized retail price of this\nproduct. This demand projection assumes no changes in pricing policies. The new government\nhas indicated that it intends to introduce major shifts in these policies. If so, the growth in\nconsumption would be stemmed, especially for LPG. Thus additional demand by the year 2000\nmight only be about 10.000 B/D and could be handled through imports or additional investment\nat Esmeraldas, depending on which option offers lower costs.\n4.64 Ecuador's produced surplus of heavy fuel oil, increasing supplies of heavier crudes,\nand relative lack of conversion capacity by world standards all confirm that a next increment of\nprocessing capacity should include a conversion element. The balance shown above would\nsuggest that this increment should be in service by the end of the decade. The economics of such\nan expansion are not assured however, considering the volatility of refining margins.\nHydrocarbons 69\nBEICIP Proposals '\u00b0\n4.65 The final refining recommendation of the above reports was for Petroecuador to\nselect a program of upgrading of both the Esmeraldas and La Peninsula (Santa Elena) refineries,\nover a period of eight years; (described as \"Case 6C\"). In order to process the heavier Oriente\ncrude anticipated, Esmeraldas would be debottlenecked to a feed rate of 110,000 B/D. The major\nequipment additions and modifications included in Case 6C and the Esmeraldas debottleneck are\npredicated on processing a \"Total Blend\" which would include all the heavy oil production in a\nsingle mix both for export and for domestic processing. Although Case 6C shows a better Net\nPresent Value than the other six cases selected for detailed study, the economics are not very\nrobust, with a negative Net Present Value at a discount rate of 12%. However, \"Overall Refining\nDistribution Cost\" indicate that Case 1 (\"as Is i.e. not doing anything) results in the lowest\noverall cost in all years through to 2010.\n4.66 Some questions arise with regard to the selection of options investigated by\nBEICIP, as follows:\nSince one of the original reasons for locating at Santa Elena is no longer relevant,\nthe closure of this refinery could provide savings in overall refining costs. Closure\nof the plant was only considered by BEICIP in conjunction with a new refinery\nat Pascuales. It could be more attractive combined with a major expansion at\nEsmeraldas. Expansion of Esmeraldas beyond 110MB/D was not considered in\nany case studied, although with a 30 year horizon, this possibility must be\nevaluated.\nWhy is an expansion of Amazonas not considered in conjunction with other\nrefinery expansion? Considering the potential advantages of Amazonas the\npossibility of a conversion refinery at Amazonas, with an expansion of pipeline\ncapacity to the Quito area, could be worth study.\nThe investment in refinery capacity required in Ecuador to balance demand growth,\nwould be reduced if a lighter crude were segregated for domestic refining. Although there is\nstatement that there would be a marginal advantage to process \"Oriente remaining\", a lighter\ncrude that could be segregated, this advantage is not quantified in the report. Furthermore, the\n'\u00b0 The BEICIP reports reviewed are:\ni) Crudos Pesados Project: \"Summary of the Studies\", Final Report,\nundated draft.\nii) \"Study of the Development of Refining and Distribution in\nEcuador\", Phase 2, Jan. 1992.\n70 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\noutput of Oriente crude will exceed domestic requirements for many years to come and none of\nthe heavier crude has, as yet, been produced.\n4.67 In considering the expansion of La Peninsula, BEICIP point out that the revamping\nof the existing distillation units included in their proposals might not be feasible if detailed\ninspection showed the condition of the plants to be deteriorated (which it most likely is, given\nthe age of the plants). They also recommend replacement of the topping plants with a new unit.\nThis almost means building a new grassroots refinery and could be thus be almost as unattractive\nas the Pascuales refinery proposal. It would depend on the remaining useful life of other\nfacilities such as tankage, utility plants, maintenance facilities, etc. This leads to the question of\npossible abandonment of this refinery location; or just preserving if for certain functions such as\nthe processing of reconstituted crudes discussed below, or operating it as an oil terminal and\nstorage facility.\n4.68 In case La Peninsula refinery were to be modernized and expanded, the proposal\nalso calls for the construction of a crude oil pipeline from Santo Domingo to La Peninsula.\nHowever, the economics (illustrated on page 83 of the first report) are not convincing. It is not\nclear why tanker costs are expected to escalate at 8% per annum, a key assumption in the\neconomic analysis. The use of tanker transport would likely require some port and storage\nimprovements, but at lower cost than the pipeline. It may be noted that a similar concern was\nexpressed during the energy assessment of 1985, with regard to the Libertad-Manta pipeline, the\nconstruction of which resulted in transport costs significantly higher than previously experienced\nwith marine transport.\n4.69 BEICIP's recommendations for modifications to Esmeraldas to accommodate\nheavier crude oils are likely to be the best and lowest cost option, unless a supply of light crude\nwere segregated specifically for local refining. This last option, which under present\ncircumstances would remain feasible into the next century, would result in the lowest investment.\n4.70 The economics of all cases were calculated by BEICIP assuming a 20 year project\nlife and a 30% residual value. This is optimistic for refinery processing projects which are\nsubject and often sensitive to the following risks:\n-crude and product price variations,\n-changes in refining technology,\n-changes in country economic conditions,\n-changes in crude availability and quality due to the success or failure of\nexploration and development,\n-changes in the technology of fuel utilization.\namong others. In particular, the 30% residual value is unrealistic since most refining equipment\nhas a zero or negative residual value, considering site cleanup and dismantling cost.\nHydrocarbons 71\nSynthetic Crude Proposal\n4.71 This proposal is set out in a Petroecuador report dated May, 1992. It is based on\nan offer by the company C. Itoh to supply a synthetic crude oil, to be processed in the La\nPeninsula refinery to make lead free gasoline, middle distillates, and virtually no heavy fuel oil.\nThe operation is proposed as an interim measure, prior to the installation of conversion capacity\nat La Peninsula.\n4.72 A \"synthetic crude\" is a mixture of semirefined petroleum fractions that can be\nfurther refined to specification products in a relatively simple refinery such as a hydroskimming\nrefinery. It could be produced from a heavy oil, such as the synthetic crudes produced in\nCanada, or it could be similar to the reconstituted crudes that have been produced in the\nCaribbean export refineries for many years, from conventional crudes. The yields of products\nshown in the report indicate that it is this latter type of reconstituted crude (\"recon\") virtually a\nmixture of semi-finished products.\n4.73 The concept of processing a recon crude at La Peninsula refinery could be\nattractive for Ecuador for a number of reasons:\nIt would reduce the volume of low value residual fuel that must be exported, prior\nto expansion of conversion capacity;\nIt could delay the need to install new refining capacity, while providing product\nat lower cost than product imports;\nThe imported material would be transported in dirty rather than clean tankers,\nproviding transport cost savings relative to product imports. These savings would\nbe further enhanced by the possibility of using backhauls in tankers that carry\nexport crude oil from Ecuador (which is the case);\nIt would be a good use for the refinery in its present configuration, not requiring\neither cracking or catalytic reforming capacity;\nIt would allow La Peninsula to immediately deliver larger volumes of clean\nproduct to the major market of the Guayaquil area, closer to this refinery;\nIt would in effect utilize surplus refining capacity that may exist in foreign\ncountries, and available at marginal cost, thus allowing potential supply cost\nsavings.\n4.74 Whereas the proposal is potentially attractive, the price asked for the synthetic\ncrude is too high. The price proposed CIF La Peninsula was to be according to the formula:\n1.8* (Oriente price FOB Balao). The price of the synthetic should be lower than the CIF price\n72 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nof the various products of which the synthetic is composed. Based on the import parity prices\nshown in BEICIP's study, the synthetic factor in the formula should be 1.68, without allowing\nfor the lower freight cost of dirty versus clean tankers, or the savings accruing from a backhaul.\nWhen these savings are considered, the factor should be below 1.60.\n4.75 The Petroecuador study considered four cases, all related to La Penfnsula\noperations. They included:\na. Processing Oriente as at present,\nb Processing a light crude, e.g. Bonny Light,\nc. Adding conversion capacity to the refinery,\nd. C. Itoh's recon crude proposal.\nThe last three all represent ways to reduce surplus heavy fuel production and give\na better balance with demand. No changes to Esmeraldas or Amazonas refineries are considered\nin combination with the above options.\n4.76 The economic analysis (commencing on page 21 of Petroecuador's report), is\nflawed in that it uses domestic (subsidized) prices to evaluate the gasoline and distillate products\nsold in Ecuador. Since this demand must in any case be met, the appropriate value should be\nthe opportunity cost, i.e. the cost of product imports. When import parity prices are used in the\nanalysis, the advantage for the recon proposal disappears. Refining Oriente crude as at present\nbecomes more attractive. This is (shown in Appendix 2) summarized as follows:\nNet Refining Margins. MM$/year:\nDomestic Price Opportunity Cost\nBasis Basis\nOriente Crude -32.6 -5.3\nSynthetic Crude -15.4 -8.1\n4.77 The report points out that the economics are sensitive to the difference in values\nbetween Oriente crude and the recon crude. The value of export fuel oil used in their study was\n9.72$/B; this is lower than would be expected at present. The current USG spot price of 3%\nsulfur fuel oil is 13.0$/B, indicating a price FOB La Libertad of about 11.0 $/B. This also\ndistorts the economics in favor of the recon proposal.\n4.78 Any contract for the supply of a synthetic crude should make provision for quality\nvariations to best balance any shortfalls in domestic production, and to match current market\nquality requirements. The inclusion of lead free gasoline may not be in Ecuador's best interest\nat the present time, as discussed below.\nHydrocarbons 73\n4.79 Appendix 2 also shows that the net refinery margin at La Peninsula would be\nnegative for either of the product pricing bases, or crude oils used. This is consistent with the\nunfavorable economics of most refineries without conversion capacity.\n4.80 The overall conclusion is that the synthetic crude option is not economically\nattractive as presently proposed. It is also very sensitive to variations in the relative prices of\nOriente crude, the synthetic crude, and residual fuel. It also represents what could potentially\nbe an attractive interim measure to improve the balance of refinery output without capital\nexpenditure, and is worthy of further study. Its urgency, however, may diminish if demand\nmanagement measures (including higher prices) are taken a result in a slowing of the growth of\ndemand.\nGasoline Quality Improvement\n4.81 The BEICIP report's comments on this subject are in summary as follows:\n-There have been no detailed on-site studies of air pollution in the major cities of\nEcuador to provide a firm basis for an evaluation of the need for higher quality\ngasolines.\n-But observations of the urban areas, and general world trends, indicate that higher\nquality gasolines will likely become justified at some time in the near future.\n-Reductions in air pollution could be achieved at a first level by marketing a low\nlead, higher octane gasoline; and at a higher level with a lead free product\npermitting the use of catalytic converters.\n-BEICIP recommend the first stage at this time, i.e. a low lead, higher octane\nproduct, combined with engine adjustments to optimize the use of the higher\noctane.\n4.82 An important conclusion is that more detailed studies of both current urban\npollution levels, and the type and condition of the automobile engine population, should certainly\nbe undertaken by specialists in this field before costly quality improvement measures are\ninitiated. The municipal government of Quito had initiated a pilot project to measure air quality\nbut its conclusions are not known.\n4.83 It is also noted that the octane requirements of the two major urban areas, Quito\nand Guayaquil, are quite different in view of the different elevations. Guayaquil will require a\nhigher octane. Particularly insofar as the two cities are each mainly supplied by different\nrefineries, it will likely be most economical to produce a different octane product for each city.\n74 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n4.84 The reason that a low lead product is proportionally less costly than a zero lead\nproduct, is due to the fact that the response of gasoline to lead addition is not linear. A small\naddition of lead has a disproportionally large benefit in terms of octane; and at low lead levels,\nlead addition is by far the most economical method of octane improvement.\n4.85 The question of aromatic content was not raised in the BEICIP report. New U.S.\nregulations require a significant reduction in aromatics which play a role in smog formation.\nThis should also be addressed if a detailed study of Ecuador's needs were carried out in the\nfuture.\n4.86 In the short term, BEICIP's recommendation for a low lead product is as far as\ncould presently be justified, prior to the acquisition of detailed data.\nHydrocarbons 75\nAnnex I\nOPTIMAL TARIFFS AND RESPONSIBLE ELECTRICITY PRICING:\nA FULLER DISCUSSION\nOPTIMAL TARIFFS\n1. Electricity tariff can be designed to meet a number of objectives. The most common ones\nare:\nI. Economic efficiency\nII. Equity\nIm. Cost recovery\nIV. Transparency and ease of implementation\nEconomic efficiency is required to maximize welfare. And economic theory tells that\nwelfare maximizations calls for short-run marginal cost (SRMC) pricing. Simply put,\nelectricity prices based on SRMC are defined as:\nP(t,l) = SRMGC(t) + CG(t) + L(t) + CT(t) where:\nP = price (cents/kWh)\nSRMGC = minimum short-run marginal system generating costs (i.e., the costs of\ngenerating an additional kWh in accordance with the merit order dispatch\nof available plant)\nCG = curtailment premium that applies if demand exceeds the capacity of\ninstalled generating plant (if not, the premium is equal to zero)\nL = losses in the transmission and distribution system (which may be positive\nor negative)\nCT = curtailment premium that applies if demand does not match the design\nlimits of the transmission and distribution network (otherwise the premium\nis equal to zero)\nt = index of time\n1 = index of location where demand is met\nEfficient prices must satisfy the above equation and are required to clear the market at\nevery point in time (t) for every location (1). Such prices properly reflect the costs of\ngenerating and supplying electricity, taking into account the load to be met, the merit\n76 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\norder dispatch, transmission losses, and the design limits of the system (see para 29).\nStated differently, they provide consumers/buyers with the correct information about the\ndifferent costs that the system incurs to serve demand. Moreover, since efficient prices\nhave to clear the market, they are just equal to what consumers are willing to pay for\nbeing supplied with electricity.\n2. Efficient electricity pricing is compatible with striking long-term contracts. In fact, since\nefficient prices may vary by time of use due to factors that are beyond the control of a\nparticular consumer/supplier, long-term contracts offer the opportunity to hedge against\nthe risk of price fluctuations. For example, a generator can sell a contract under which\nthe consumer/buyer has the option to purchase (at some date in the future), say, 1 MWh\nfor $30 (3 cents/kWh). At any point in time, the value that this contract has to the\nconsumer is equal to the difference between the actual (efficient) price prevailing in the\nmarket, p(t), and 3 cents/kWh, times 1,000 kWh, i.e. [p(t) -3 cents/kWh] 1,000 kWh. By\nthe same token, if the generator's SRMGC amounted to 3 cents/kWh, his/her net revenues\nwould be equal to the consumer's net benefits should the latter exercise the option to buy.\nMoreover, in perfect markets, the price of the contract/option would approach a level at\nwhich the generator recovers the costs of generating capacity needed to supply 1 MWh\n(disregarding any constraints and costs imposed by the transmission system). Thus, under\nideal conditions, fixed-price fixed-quantity contracts would divest sellers/buyers of the risk\nin the returns/benefits from trading electricity, without violating the principle of efficient\npricing.\n3. Efficient prices are equitable in the sense that they provide consumers (or suppliers) with\nno incentives to retrade or recontract electricity among themselves. Hence, efficient prices\nrule out cross-subsidies. This is because if there were cross-subsidies among consumers,\nsome users would be willing to pay a higher price than that granted to the subsidized ones\nso that brokering of electricity -if it were feasible- would eventually make both parties\nbetter off. Even though the above equity argument is a particularly strong one, people\nmay have different opinions about what characterizes equitable prices. For instance, it can\nbe argued that low-income consumers should be served at a price set below costs. In\nmaking this point, though, one implicitly calls for a tariff system that cannot be\neconomically efficient. This means that the provision of subsidies will cause extra costs\nabove and beyond the monetary value of the subsidies. The size of these extra costs\ndepends on how and by whom the subsidy is granted and financed. So if subsidies are\ndeemed desirable, they should be applied in a cost efficient manner. In this context, cost-\nefficiency means that (i) the costs of administering the subsidy are kept at a minimum,\n(ii) the subsidies are financed in a neutral way, (iii) the subsidies are precisely targeted\nto the group that is intended to benefit from the measure, and (iv) the (estimated) benefits\nthat accrue to the target group are at least as high as the direct costs of the subsidies.\n4. Equity considerations aside, there are other problems with SRMC-pricing. One is that\nefficient prices may not enable the supplier to recover total costs. This happens when\nAnnex 1: Optimal Tariffs and Responsible Electricity Pricing 77\nmarginal costs are below average costs. Furthermore, even if efficient prices help recoup\ntotal costs, they may not yield a \"fair\" or \"adequate\" rate of return. It can be argued,\nhowever, that cost recovery, and more so profits , may come at the expense of economic\nefficiency (to the extend that it requires a departure from SRMC-pricing). While the\nargument is valid in theory (where it is assumed that prompt and non-distortionary\ngovernment transfers would render a cost efficient, but loss-making utility financially\nviable), it misses an important point when applied to real-world conditions. In practice,\nan insolvent utility that depends on government transfers lacks incentives to operate\nefficiently. Moreover, a utility that is required to operate like a non-profit organization\nwill find it difficult to raise funds from non-government sources or, as the case may be,\nattract private investors whenever this is needed or desirable. Finally, a regulated utility\nthat does business in the quest of profits is more likely to cut costs and diversify its\nservices than would be an executive branch of the government that runs the sector on the\nbasis of general budget allocations. Likewise, electricity prices that support commercial\ngoals, but are not fully congruent with the ideal of economic efficiency, tend to\noutperform tariff systems that (at best) are designed to be economically efficient, yet\nprovide the utility with no incentives (rewards and penalties) to operate in an efficient\nway.\n5. So convincing is the case that can be made for SRMC-pricing on theoretical grounds, so\ndifficult is its implementation in practice. As has been stressed in para 1, perfectly\ndesigned efficient tariffs have to continuously adjust over time (and space). Bearing this\nin mind, efficient electricity prices are often called \"spot prices\". Obviously, perfect spot\npricing is an elusive goal. Even tariffs that only remotely resemble the ideal of spot\npricing are rather complicated to design and apply. Advanced and costly metering and\n(two-way) communications technologies would be required to render some kind of spot\npricing feasible. Also, utilities and electricity users must be able to digest and harness a\nlarge amount of information. So in most circumstances, particularly when demand and\nsupply are not very diversified, the pursuit of a perfectly efficient pricing policy is not\nworth the effort. Consequently, the ideal of economic efficiency has to be reconciled with\nthe limited abilities of electricity suppliers and users to signal, and respond to, changes\nin costs and preferences.\nRESPONSIBLE ELECTRICITY PRICING\n6. Responsible electricity pricing is a compromise between the requirements of economic\nefficiency and the actual capabilities to meet these requirements. As has been outlined\nbefore, there are number of constraints and risks that beset the task of devising electricity\ntariffs. Responsible pricing takes account of these factors.\n7. First and foremost, electricity tariffs should be structured so as to inform users about the\ncosts they impose on the system. That is, the design of the tariff system should be\nstructurally correct, not necessarily at the margin, but on average. Second, prices should\n78 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nbe financially viable, i.e. allow the utility to at least recover its costs. It is worth noting\nin this connection that if prices are based on load-specific average costs, they will satisfy\nthe first two requirements. Third, the tariff system should be compatible with commercial\ngoals. In particular, if the power sector has to strive for scarce financial resources, the\nregulatory framework should permit utilities to generate positive returns. Moreover, under\nsuch conditions, profitability should become a measure of good performance and, thus,\nwill have a decisive impact on whether and to what extent scarce resources are made\navailable to the sector. Fourth, the tariff system should be vertically disintegrated. This\nmeans, prices should provide separate information about costs attributable to the\nconsecutive services (generation, transmission, etc), that the sector performs in supplying\nits customers. Fifth, the tariff system should be horizontally disaggregated. This postulate\nsays that if it is feasible to diversify services in terms of price, customers should be given\nthe opportunity to choose among these services.\n8. The last two requirements often are subsumed under the term \"unbundling of services\".\nSectorwide, unbundling is an issue relevant to the division of labor between power\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution. In particular, the current structure of Ecuador's\npower sector lends itself to a solution that strengthens the corporate identity of the\ndistribution companies. By the same token, it is opportune to increase the distribution\ncompanies' responsibility for tariffs set at the retail level. Since services and costs vary\nacross the country's franchised distribution areas, the companies should be given\ndiscretion to custom-tailor their tariffs to the conditions under which they operate, subject,\nof course, to regulatory supervision. This would result in a dual tariff system: One for\nbulk power transactions between the generation and transmission complex and its\nwholesale customers (the distribution companies and, as the case may be, large industrial\nusers), and one that applies to the retail level and reflects the different infrastructural and\neconomic characteristics of the distribution areas. Once a coherent system of tariffs for\nbulk supplies is in place (differentiated by load, voltage level, and location), the\ndistribution companies should be held responsible for selecting a mix of bulk supplies and\nown generation that serves their customers at least cost. In a later stage, it may also\nbecome feasible that the transmission system facilitates power wheeling operations\nbetween different distribution companies, provided that this option proves to be\neconomically advantageous.\n9. Retail tariffs that take account of regional differences may appear to be discriminatory.\nHowever, this will not be the case as long as tariff differentials are a mere response to\nthe diversity of demand and costs (rather than a means of reaping monopoly profits). Of\ncourse, they may also reflect imbalances that impair the distribution companies' ability\nto cut costs. In this event, policy makers may find it desirable to alleviate the impact of\nregional disparity and uneven development with the aid of electricity tariffs. Government,\nhowever, should resist this temptation and choose among other measures better suited to\naddress the problem of regional imbalances. Also, in the past policy makers seemed to\nbelieve that they have a social obligation to subsidize and encourage the residential use\nAnnex 1: Optimal Tariffs and Responsible Electricity Pricing 79\nof electricity. Electricity, however is a valuable good, and in general households that are\nable to pay for the consumption of this good are also willing to do so. So there is\nabsolutely no need to charge them less than it costs to meet their demand. Different\nconsiderations may apply to low-income, low-volume consumers that have access to, or\ncan easily be connected to the grid, and would gain substantial benefits from using\nelectricity. Subsidies granted to this category of consumers should be transparent, properly\ntargeted, and accounted for, and must be financiable without large deadweight losses.\n10. While it appears logical and feasible to diversify tariffs at the retail level, perfect\nunbundling of transmission services is often considered to be too complex an issue to be\nmanageable in practical applications. Also, the benefits from sophisticated transmission\ncharges may not justify the effort required to design and administer such a refinement.\nSo it comes not much as a surprise that INECEL's recently completed tariff study\nproposes a vertically (by voltage level) disintegrated scheme of\ntransmission/subtransmission rates that uniformly apply across the grid. No attempt is\nmade to horizontally disaggregate transmission charges. This approach can be justified for\ntwo reasons. First, from an accounting point of view, it is more convenient to charge\nnetwork costs and the costs transmission services on a per kW and per kWh basis,\nwithout regard to spatial differences along the network. Moreover, if bulk power\ngeneration and transmission are performed by a singly entity (as is the case under the\ncurrent institutional framework of Ecuador's power sector), transmission support services\n(e.g. voltage support, frequency control) and line losses can be considered a common cost\nto the system (e.g. generation and transmission). And as long as unbundled tariffs for bulk\npower supplies recover these costs, there is no pressing need to disaggregate and price\nunderlying cause and effect relationships. Second, and more importantly, disaggregated\ntransmission pricing that takes account of the impact that net-injections at each node have\non the whole system (e.g. in terms of line flows, dispatch) may be redundant if spatial\ndifferences are negligible or net themselves out over time. Whether or not this is the case\nunder the current operating conditions of Ecuador's power sector remains to be\ninvestigated.\n11. At any rate, some sort of disaggregated transmission pricing will be required once\nindependent power generators (IPP's) or generating facilities operated by the distribution\ncompanies are permitted to wheel power across the transmission system. In this event,\nthese supplies should be priced on the basis of \"avoided costs\" to the rest of the system,\ni.e., the costs, net of any savings, that the system would experience in the absence of\nthese supplies. Clearly, avoided savings, i.e. the extra costs that these supplies may\nimpose on the system strongly depend on the way in which they impact the line flows in\nthe network and the merit order dispatch of the system's generating plant. A rational tariff\nsystem should account for these factors to induce the optimal use of generating facilities\nowned by independent or non-utility suppliers, particularly when their supplies make up\na large share of bulk power transactions across the main grid.\n80 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nAnnex 2\nTARIFF DESIGN: CRITIOUE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INECEL'S\nNEW WORLD BANK FINANCED TARIFF STUDY\n1. INECEL's new tariff study was completed in March 1992. Its implementation (which this\nreport strongly endorses) could make an important contribution to restoring the financial\nhealth of the sector and enhancing the incentive framework of its operators and customers.\nThe study is based on a careful examination of short-and long-run system-costs,\noperational features of the system, and the profile of loads. It calls for an increase in the\nlevel and a change in the structure and number of rates applying to wholesale and retail\ntransactions. The suggested changes in the tariff system are directionally correct and\nwould bring about significant improvements on how electricity is generated, transmitted,\ndistributed, and used. In particular, the proposed tariffs vary by time-of-use, reflect\nseasonal variations (although some dilution of the seasonal cost differences occurs) of\nsupply and demand, and account for line losses and the costs of transmission and\ndistribution services. Compared to the rates which are currently in place, the new system\nwould increase average tariffs by 3.0 UScents/kWh for industrial users, 3.5 UScents/kWh\nfor commercial users, and 5.7 UScents/kWh for residential customers.\n2. In order to calculate the system's unit generating costs, the study assumed that the costs\nof meeting a marginal increase in peak load (CMP) plus the system's average marginal\nenergy costs (CME) are equal to average incremental generating costs. The latter are\ndefined as the ratio (R) of discounted annual changes in system expansion costs (net of\ntransmission and generation) to discounted annual changes in future demand, averaged\nover a planning horizon of 13 years (T). Hence, the basic equation can be written as\nR/T = CMP + CME\n(For details, see Annex III). The study also assumed that the peaker plant is a gas turbine\nwith annuitized costs of 78.9$/kW and a load factor of 0.61. Consequently, CMP = 14.8\nUSCents/kWh. Moreover, based on the least cost system expansion plan and the\ncorresponding demand forecast, the study's estimate of R is 481 USCents/kWh so that\nRIT = 40.1 USCents/kWh. Therefore, CME = 25.3 USCents/kWh. Expressed in prices of\nJanuary 1992, the figures translate into 90.3 $kW/year for the peaker plant, corresponding\nto 1.66 USCents/kWh, and 2.93 USCents/kWh for the system's marginated energy costs,\nas is shown in the first row of Table 1.7.\n3. The average costs of providing, maintaining, and operating transmission and\nsubtransmission capacity are usually expressed as the ratio of discounted expenses for\nthese services to the discounted future flows (in kW) through the lines of the network. It\nis also common to lump these costs together with the costs of load that under normal\nAnnex 2: Tariff Design 81\nconditions gets lost (for technical reasons) within the transmission and subtransmission\nnetwork. The same approach has been used by the tariff study, and the resulting figures\n($/kW) are presented in the first column of Table 1.7. The second column of the table\nindicates how average energy costs increase in direct proportion to line losses that occur\nalong the transmission chain. Similar considerations apply to distribution networks,\nalthough costs may vary significantly among different service areas. The cost estimates\nshown in Table 1.7 are broken down along the distribution chain and reflect systemwide\naverages.\n4. Table 1.8 shows how electricity supply costs, broken down to the subtransmission level\non average vary by season and time-of-day. The dry season, which under the currently\nused hydropotential lasts from November to March, accounts for about 150 days a year.\nPeak demand occurs between 7pm and lOpm, whereas base load demand is referred to\nthe period between lOpm and 8am. The seasonal impact on energy costs overwhelm that\nassociated with daily fluctuations of load. Energy costs vary by about 6 USCents/kWh\nseasonally, while the cost differential during the day is at most 1 USCents/kWh.\n5. Based on the calculation of electricity supply costs, the study proposes a system of tariffs\nthat can be categorized in terms of the location where load is met.\n(i) Interconnection Points (Nodes): Tariffs apply to bulk supplies\npurchased by distribution companies at nodes along the 230 kV\ntransmission system.\n(ii) High voltage level: Tariffs apply to bulk supplies delivered to large\nusers at voltage levels between 138 and 46 kV.\n(iii) Medium voltage level: Tariffs apply to customers served by\ndistribution companies at voltage levels between 22 and 6.3 kV.\n(iv) Low voltage level: Tariffs apply to customers served by\ndistribution companies at voltage levels of 115/120 and 210/220 V.\nIn addition, the tariffs falling into the first three categories include an hourly capacity\ncharge for peak and off-peak demand, and energy charges differentiated by season and time-of-\nday. Medium voltage consumers face an optional two-part tariff with a monthly demand charge\nand a seasonal energy fee. Low voltage users are subject to two-part tariffs tailored to customer\nclasses, comprising a demand charge and an undifferentiated unit price for energy. The resulting\ntariff system looks as follows:\n82 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nProposed Tariff System\nSystem Tariff Type Power (S/kW/Month) Energy (USCents/kWh)\nLevel CF Measurement Peak Off-Peak Dry Humid\nInterconn. 0.95 Hourly 7.17 1.53 7.13, 6.48, 5.90 2.18, 1.51, 1.06\nHigh Volt 0.95 10.23 3.25 7.24, 6.60, 6.01 2.21, 1.52, 1.07\nMed Volt 0.90 11.18 1.48 7.33, 6.69, 6.10 2.23, 1.52, 1.07\nMed Volt 0.90 Two-Part, 3.18 8.57 3.52\nSeasonal\nEnergy\nCharge\nLow Voltage\n-Indust. 0.89 Two-Part 3.62 5.97\n-Comm. 0.90 3.83 6.08\n-Resid. 0.40 * 1.70 6.95\nLighting Flat Rate 21.93\nSource: INECEL\n6. The following observations can be made:\n(i) Both the level and structure of the proposed tariffs deviate from the underlying\ncosts of supply. For instance, the monthly capacity charges underestimate the costs\nof meeting peak load. The energy charges, on the other hand, exceed the\ncorresponding cost figures (except for the low-voltage level). Also, tariffs tend to\nsmooth out cost differentials between the wet and dry season. This is because\ntransmission line costs plus losses have been transformed into wet-season energy\ncharges. Finally, substation costs and losses (18.4US$/kW/year) as well as\nsubtransmission costs (39US$/kW/year) appear as off-peak capacity charges.\n(ii) At the low voltage level, the accumulated medium voltage capacity charges are\nreflected in the energy rates (adjusted for peak responsibility factors). The demand\ncharges only cover the costs of the distribution system (adjusted for coincidence\nfactors). And the consumer class specific energy rates do not vary by time-of-day\nor season.\n(iii) There is a flat monthly rate for public lighting. However, the proposed tariff\nsystem includes no (subsidized) rates for low-volume users. In fact, even though\ncross subsidies between rating periods and consumer classes are pervasive, the\nproposed system renders the sector financially viable, i.e. does not call for\ngovernment transfers.\n7. Some of the features of the proposed tariff regime are debatable. For instance, the\nargument that large, cost-based fluctuations of payments for electricity may cause cash-\nflow problems, particularly on the part of industrial and commercial users, and therefore,\nAnnex 2: Tariff Design 83\nshould be reduced through proper adjustments in the tariff structure, is not very\npersuasive. More importantly, there is no need for off-peak capacity charges since buyers\nof bulk supplies can be charged for peak load on an hourly basis. Also, the allocation of\ntransmission line costs in form of wet season energy charges lacks plausibility. If\ntransmission line design limits are more binding in the wet season, the corresponding\ncosts should be made transparent in the form of separate charges. There are other\nshortcomings that are attributable to the lack of reliable information on demand\ncharacteristics. For example, the coincidence factors used by study appear to be flawed.\nHowever, once additional data are available, such problems can be resolved through tariff\nrevisions and fine tuning. At any rate, while there are several ways of refining the\nproposed tariff regime, this should by no means delay its implementation. Rather,\nINECEL and policy makers should take immediate steps to replace the existing tariff\nregime with the new one.\n8. Given the fact that Ecuador's electricity sector is not only capacity-and energy\nconstrained, but also faces formidable difficulties in obtaining the resources needed for\nfurther expansion, the implementation of the new tariff system becomes a matter of\nutmost concern. It will curb excessive demand through price, -which is a more efficient\nway of allocating scarce supplies than rationing-, and help the sector to regain a sound\nfinancial basis for improving and increasing its services. To achieve these goals, there is\nno long way to go. Highest priority should be given to the revision of the Board's\nresolution No.0263 of September 1988 which guides de current tariff policy and is\nincompatible with the proposed new tariff regime. This will lay the groundwork for a\nrapid implementation of the urgently needed changes in tariff policy. In a second step, the\nlegal and regulatory framework can be adjusted to comply with the requirements of the\nnew tariff policy.\n84 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nAnnex 3\nCALCULATION OF AVERAGE INCREMENTAL GENERATING COSTS\nThe study approximates the projected stream of future electricity sales E (t), expressed in MWh,\nby the exponential growth function.\n(1) E (t) = E (0) exp [bt], t= 0,1,2 ......

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n1. Economic measures proposed for Ecuador are to essentially bring prices to their economic\nlevels, namely for oil prices to reflect opportunity costs (mostly world prices FOB Ecuador) and\nfor electricity tariffs to reflect Long Run Marginal Costs (LRMC).\n2. These measures have substantial macroeconomic and social impacts. As the proposed\npricing policy would eliminate the fiscal deficit and the need for monetary emission, lower\ninflation rates would be achieved and would stabilize the real income of the population,\nespecially of low-income households. In addition, prices at economic level would restore\nEcuadorean competitiveness by improving efficiency in resource allocation.\n3. The central question this section addresses is whether a \"mitigated\" removal of the oil and\npower subsidies, that is price deregulation along with social mitigation policies, would generate\nenough public revenues to eliminate the fiscal deficit, and by eliminating the need for monetary\nfinancing of this deficit, eliminate inflation. Can social welfare and a fiscal surplus be\nreconciled? In other words, what would low-income households and the economy as a whole\ngain from the elimination of energy price subsidies? Will the chronic inflation problem of the\nEcuadorean economy be ever resolved? The analysis of this issue focuses on three groups of\nquestions:\n(a) How much the fiscal deficit would be reduced by the removal of oil and power\nsubsidies? The answer deals with the limits of public choice and political decision\nprocess. However, in the short run it can be assumed that public revenues\ngenerated by prices at economic level would not be offset by automatic equivalent\nexpenditure growth.\n(b) The extent to which monetary emission would be reduced if the fiscal deficit were\neliminated depends upon external financing of the deficit. That is, on the ratio\nbetween external and domestic funding of the public sector. The answer also\ndepends upon the balance of payments origin of the money supply and the related\nsterilization policy.\n(c) The third question is about the impact of a reduced fiscal deficit upon the\ninflationary process. The relation among these macroeconomic targets is not\nstraightforward. One needs to consider imported inflation, the liquidity ratio of\nthe economy, the velocity of money and consumer behavior in terms of demand\nfor real balances.\nAnnex 4: Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 87\nData are from the Ministry of Finance and from the Banco Central Del Ecuador. A uniform\nstatistical source is used for consistency, even through available statistics on public finance are\nsketchy. In fact, National Accounts and IMF data differ in coverage precluding a direct\ncomparison.\n4. The second part of this section summarizes the macroeconomic impacts of various\nscenarios of higher energy prices, including the short-term fiscal impact. The paragraphs that\nfollow present the equation models to capture Ecuador's monetary and inflationary trends from\n1986 to 1991. This model is used to simulate the deflationary impact for 1991. Conclusions\nfollow.\nII. MAIN RESULTS\nA. Results of the Global Elimination of Subsidies\n5. The effects of increased energy prices on public revenues, fiscal deficit, money supply\nand inflation are summarized in Table 1. The simulation for 1991 show that eliminating oil and\npower subsidies would definitely eliminate the fiscal deficit and in addition would generate a\nsubstantial fiscal surplus of 344 billion Sucres or 2.8 per cent of GDP. Monetary financing of\nthe public deficit will no longer be required, and since the domestic component of monetary\nemission will be eliminated, the rate of inflation will be drastically reduced, by about 60 per cent.\nMoreover, negative changes in monetary base (-237 bn Sucres, resulting from a -129 per cent\nimpact) will represent a net accumulation of positive balances in the Central Bank and in other\npublic financial institutions. In 1991, eliminating oil subsidies would increased oil revenues by\nS/342 billion (or 2.8% of GDP), while eliminating power subsidies would have raised additional\nS/233 billion (or 1.9% of GDP), the sum of both would be S/575 billion of 4.7 of GDP.\n6. In the short-term, the external component of monetary emission will subsist as a result\nof the accumulation of international reserves. This residual emission explains, interalia the 40\nper cent residual inflation. In the long term, however, this external cause of inflation could be\noffset. Calculation shows that, if the monetary consequences (of international reserves) could be\ntotally avoided, the inflation rate would be reduced by more than 100%. In fact, two factors can\noffset the monetary consequences of the accumulation of international reserves. First, the net\naccumulation of positive balances in the Central Bank by the Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS)\nwill compensate the balance of payments surpluses and the related increase in monetary base.\nInflation will be reduced. As a result, domestic saving will increase, leading to additional\nsterilization of high powered money. Second, the cure of inflation will restore Ecuadorean\ncompetitiveness. Depreciation of the local currency will stop as well as the revaluation of the\nstock of international monetary reserves. Monetary consequences of this latter appreciation will\nbe eliminated. These virtuous circles will lead to successive reduction of inflation, within an\ninterval between -60 and -100 per cent, definitely stopping the inflationary process.\n88 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nB. Social Mitiation\n7. Monetary and deflationary performances will be achieved even if, in line with\nmore recent pronouncements, some of the additional revenues were used to compensate the poor\npeople who bear a large share of adjustment costs. In fact, calculations show that even if one-\nthird of additional revenues (192 billion Sucres) were used to mitigate the impact of price\nadjustments on low-income households, there would be nonetheless sufficient revenues to\neliminate the deficit, the need for monetary emission and, thence, to dramatically reduce inflation.\nThus, even in the case of sizeable social mitigation, (arising 1/3 of new revenues to this purpose)\nthe consolidated fiscal deficit will be more thant eliminated, going from 230.8 billion Sucres in\n1991 (-1.9 per cent of GDP) to a surplus of 152.6 billion (+1.2 per cent of GDP). While these\nfigures do not seem important in terms of GDP, it is worth noting that this surplus is a net\nsurplus, since social costs are already covered. In this case, the absolute reduction in inflation,\nin the long-term, is of the order of 95 per cent, that is, virtually no inflation. Since this price\ncorrection is the result of 86.4 per cent reduction in monetary emission, the related price elasticity\nwill be about 1.10, which is very much in line with the recent evolution of the Ecuadorean\neconomy (see para. 34). This a posteriori justification fully validates the impact calculations.\nAnnex 4: Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 89\nTABLE 1\nECUADOR -Impact of Increased Energy Prices on Public Revenues,\nFiscal Deficit.

The removal of oil subsidies would result in a 111 bn Sucre fiscal surplus. This would\nlead to a 77 per cent reduction in the domestic component of monetary emission and, mutatis\nrnutandis, a successive decrease from -35 to -83 per cent in the general price index. The 1991\nsimulation shows that inflation would have fallen from 50 per cent to the much more acceptable\nlimit of 8.5 per cent. In fact, this reduction of inflation will be more profitable to low-income\nhouseholds in terms of increase in real income and purchasing power, than the revenues saved\nfrom having subsidized prices on oil products such as gasoline or LPG. The monetary and\ndeflationary impacts could even be more important. In fact, implicit subsidies on petroleum\nprices were estimated for 1991 between 342 Mio US$ (low production scenario) and 464.7 Mio\nUS$ (high scenario). Here, only the low production scenario (342 bn subsidies) was considered.\nEconomic measures proposed are to bring all prices to their economic levels. Simulations were\nmade under this assumption.\nD. Results of the Elimination of Power Subsidies\n9. Similarly, elimination of 233 billion sucres in subsidies in the power subsector in 1991\nwould result in a 58 per cent reduced inflation. This result is important compared to the size of\nthe power sub-sector in terms of GDP. Figures for one sub-sector are given for ease of\ncomprehension, since price deregulation in only one sub-sector would lead to massive interfuel\nsubstitution and factor reallocation process (and therefore, these partial impacts would not take\nplace).\nIII. DETERMINATION OF THE FISCAL DEFICIT\nAdditional Public Revenues\n10. The oil and power subsectors are state property, under the monopolistic control of public\nenterprises. Non-Financial Public Sector revenues will increase by the same amount as oil and\npower subsidies are cut, since oil and power revenues are assigned by law to the public sector\n(not necessarily the public enterprises as Petroecuador's income is largely independent of the\nprices at which its products are sold domestically). The Ecuadorean Public Sector receives the\ngross revenues of public enterprises after deduction of retail margins. According to law,\nPetroecuador must deposit all of its revenues at the Central Bank, which in turn distributes them\naccording to the rules of earmarked revenues, including those to be received by the company (to\ncover its costs). Thus, the financial results of Petroecuador are net results for the State. These\nresults assume essentially no reduction in consumption (although if that were to happen, higher\nexport sales would offset lower domestic sales), and no drastic increase in the operating costs of\nsector enterprises.\n11. Total subsidies that can be recovered (under the low estimate) are S/575 billion for 1991,\nand S/775 billion under the high estimate. The calculation of electric power subsidies was based\non the ratio of US$0.041 subsidy per kWh consumed, reflecting the long-run marginal cost\nstructure (LRMC) of UScent8.31 and UScent6.36 per kWh. Total electricity consumption\nAnnex 4: Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 91\namounted to 5,260.3 GWh in 1991, requiring a S/233 billion subsidy \". The oil subsidy. atUS$11.5 per barrel, was calculated as potential additional income per domestic barrel, that is, thebalance between the opportunity cost (US$15/barrel in 1991) and the implicit price of domesticcrude entering the refinery (US$3.5/barrel). The low estimate of total oil subsidies for 1991 wasabout S/342 billion'2.\n12. The ratio of oil subsidies to total Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS) oil revenues(exports and domestic sales) declined during the current period (1988-1991) as oil prices werefalling and as exports increased comparative to domestic sales. Table 3 demonstrates that forevery US$ increase in the price of a domestic barrel, oil revenues of the NFPS would haveincreased by approximately 0.6% of GDP in 1990, against only 0.3% in 1991. However, in thelong run (after 1996), exports will decrease relatively to domestic demand since oil output willthen start to decline (Table 4).\nTABLE 2\nECUADOR -Estimates of Oil and Power Subsidies. 1991\n(Billions of Sucres)\n1991 Oil Prices Power Oil and (After Social\nSubsidies Prices Power Mitigation)\nSubsidies Subsidies\nHigh Estimate S/493 bn S/280 bn S/775 bn (S/520 bn)\nLow Estimate S/342 bn S/233 bn S/575 bn (S/383 bn)\n(2.87% GDP) (1.9) (4.7) (3.2)\nSource: World Bank estimates and INE. The low estimates area used in this econometricanalysis.\n13. The ratio of oil subsidies to total Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS) oil revenues(exports and domestic sales) declined during the current period 1988-1991 as oil prices werefalling and as exports increased comparatively to the domestic sales. Table 3 demonstrates thatfor every US dollar increase in the price of a domestic barrel, oil revenues of the NFPS wouldhave increased by approximately 0.6 per cent of GDP in 1990, against only 0.3 per cent in 1991.In the long run however (after 1996), exports will decrease relatively to domestic demand, sinceoil output will then start to decline (Table 4).\nThe definitive LRMC structure of 8.31 and 6.82 UScents/kWh leads to an average subsidyper unit consumption of 0.050 US$/kWh. This represents a subsidy level of US$263million. Calculations are based on a subsidy level of US$215.6 million. In both cases, foroil and power, we have referred to the low estimate, to be sure that proposed impacts arenot exaggerated.\n12 A higher estimate of US$464 million was calculated by INE (1992, see Annex). Thisamounts to 495.3 billion Sucres at the average intervention and free market exchangerates of S/1,067.5 for US$ in 1991.\n92 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nTABLE 3\nECUADOR -Oil Subsidies and Oil Revenues, 1988-1991\n1988 1989 1990 1991\nOil Revenues 233.2 479.0 955.3 1,093.4\nImplicit Oil Subsidies 116.6 217.0 354.5 341.8\nSubsidies as percentage 50.0% 45.3% 37.1% 31.1%\nof Revenues\nSource: Ministry of Finance and World Bank calculations.\nTABLE 4\nProjected Non-Financial Public Sector Oil Revenues for 1991-1998 1/\n(Percentage of GDP)\n1990 1991 1993 1994 1996 1997 1998\nTotal NFPS 26.4 26.2 25.4 24.5 24.0 23.3 22.6\nRevenues\nOil Revenues 11.4 9.1 9.2 8.4 7.8 7.2 6.5\n.From Domestic 1.8 1.7 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.7 1.7\nProducts\n|.From Exports 9.7 7.2 7.4 6.5 6.1 5.4 4.8\n1/ Projections are based on constant real world prices of petroleum prevailing in 1991.\nSource: Ministry of Finance\nSituation of Public Expenditure\n14. Oil and power revenues are largely assigned to the public sector. However, the\nimmediate effect of the elimination of subsidies on the fiscal deficit will depend on the amount\nof related public expenditures. Extra-budgetary allocations ensure that increased oil revenues\ntranslate automatically into somewhat higher expenditures (through earmarked funds and through\nthe investment budget of PETROECUADOR). However, this automatic effect would be limited\nto the short-run, if increases in expenditures matching the increased revenues were deliberately\navoided by the Government. In fact, an Oil Stabilization Fund has been instituted, which could\nbe used to sterilize the oil windfall, thus contributing to macroeconomic stability.\nAnnex 4: Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 93\nDetermination of the Non-Financial Public Sector Deficit\n15.

The consolidated fiscal deficit is presented in Tables 6 and 7 as a percentage of GDP and\nin nominal amounts, respectively. The impact of increased energy prices on the overall fiscal\nresult will be substantial on a cash basis. First, because on a cash basis NFPS fiscal adjustments\n96 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nwere already achieved in 1990 and 199113 .A second reason is the role of oil revenues and\nsubsidies in the NFPS's balance sheet. Oil revenues have amounted to roughly one half of total\ngovernment revenues and remain the most powerful fiscal policy tool'4.During the period 1983-\n1989, oil revenues ranged from a minimum of 31% of total revenues in 1987 to a maximum of\n51% in 1985. For 1991, the ratio was 34.7%.\n16. Variants of this impact are presented in Table 8. In the case of social mnitigation policies,\nthe elimination of oil and power subsidies will generate, on a cash basis, large fiscal surpluses\namounting to S/486.4 billion (low estimate) or to S/623.4 billion (high estimate). As high\npowered money is issued on a cash basis, the fiscal surplus should lead to a reduction in the\nmonetary base, as seen below, due to massive public saving and the related accumulation of\npositive balances in the Central Bank. Even on an accrual basis, social mitigation would still\npermit a balanced surplus of S/9.8 billion in the high estimate case, and almost no deficit (S/-\n127.2 billion) in the low estimate case. This accrual result is important since it would stop the\ngrowth of the external debt, whose burden represented 122% of GDP in 1988, partly due to the\ndepreciation of the sucre.\nTable 8 Impact of Energy Price increases on the Consolidated Fiscal Deficit (CFD) -\nCalculation for 1991 (Billions of Sucres)\nYear 1991 Elimination of Oil and Assigning 1/3 Additional\nPower Subsidies Revenues to Social Spending\nLow hypothesis High hypothesis Low hypothesis High hypothesis\nNew accrual CFD +64.8 +264.8 -127.2 +9.8\nNew cash CFD +678.4 +878.4 +486.4 +623.4\nMemo Item Oil and Power Subsidies .

The budget, however, still remains the major instrument in Government\nattempts to reduce the overall non-financial public sector deficit (financial adjustment of\n6.5% of GDP was achieved through the Budget between 1982 and 1985).\nAnnex 4: Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 97\nIV. MEASUREMENT OF THE MONETARY IMPACT\nEmpirical Preliminaries\n16. The consistency between fiscal deficits and other macroeconomic targets can be judged\nby looking at the Government Budget's constraint. This constraint says that the sum of the non-\ninterest deficit and the interest bill on foreign and domestic debt is equal to the sum of financing\nfrom all sources. Fiscal deficits can be financed in three ways: issuing external debt, issuing\ninterest-bearing internal debt, and obtaining monetary financing, which is monetary emission\n17. The first approach to the monetary financing is on the demand-side. Expenditures\ndemand of the public sector (all government entities along with the Central Bank) must be\ncovered as follows:\n(1) CFD = EF* + DCg + DLg\nwhere:\nCFD = consolidated fiscal deficit, on an accrual basis\n= D + iB + i*(B* -IR)e, as calculated in Table 7 15\nDCg = Central Bank advances to the public sector = the monetary\nfinancing.\nDLg = Loans of the domestic banking system to the government and\npublic entities. DLg is the domestic debt. DLg equal private\ndeposits short of the loans to the private sector:\nDL = D(l-m) -Lp\nwhere D are private deposits.\nEF* = external financing, which is the sum of voluntary external financing\n(VEF) and of interest arrears (EXA) or involuntary financing. EF*\nis thus the accrued external debt. EF* is exogenous.\n(2) EF* = VEF + EXA\nGiven the lack of private domestic resources (DLg decreased as deposits D were under-\nremunerated) and the sharp decrease in the net voluntary external borrowing (VEF was -2.6 %\nof GDP in 1990 and -1.9 % in 1991, as shown in Table 5), the Ecuadorean Government asked\nfor monetary creation (DCg) as the principal method of financing the fiscal deficit. However,\nmonetary emissions were complemented by the accumulation of external-interest arrears. Between\n1987 and 1991, impacts on inflation, economic growth and balance of payments have been\nlessened by the fact that Ecuador was granted grace periods on its external debt. Deriving the\nIS See Table 7, where:\nD = non-interest deficit\ni (i*) = nominal interest rate on domestic (or foreign*) debt\nB (B*) = domestic (or foreign*) debt\ne = nominal exchange rate\nIR = international exchange reserves\n98 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nrelation between the fiscal deficit and money creation should thus be performed on a cash basis.\nThe consolidated fiscal deficit must be made net of external arrears (EXA). From demand-\nequation (1) and identity (2) we can derive that:\n(3) CFD = (VEF + EXA)* + DCg + DLg\nrearranging:\n(3') CFD -EXA* = VEF* + DCg + DLg\n18. The second approach to the monetary financing -i.e. to money creation -is on the supply\nside. First, the Central bank issues base money (H) to cover credits to the government (DCg) and\nto the private sector (CPS), and to cover the Central Bank's accumulated profits or net worth\n(NW). It is the endogenous component of monetary emission.\nIn a small and open economy, monetary emission will also result from the accumulation\nof international reserves (IR *) due to the surplus of the balance of payments 16. It constitutes the\nexogenous component of the monetary emission. The supply-equation of base money yields:\n(4) H = DCg + IR*e -NW + CPS\nwhere:\nH = high powered money or base money (B)\nmD + (c + m(l-c)). M\nwhere: M = MI = f (Price P, domestic interest id, Y)\nD = private deposits = f (P, id, Y)\nm = reserve ratio on deposits D\nc = currency/MI ratio\nIR*e = international reserves IR*, revaluated at the current exchange rate\ne\nNW = the Central Bank's profit counterpart.\nCentral Bank's profits (NW) consist of interest earnings on net foreign assets and international\nreserves, NW = i*IR*e. However, interest on external reserves provided 0.2 per cent of GDP in\n1989, that is Sucres 11,448 Mio (see Table 6). Thus, income on external operations are negligible\nfor the Ecuadorean Central Bank. So we can simplify:\n(4') H = DCg + IR*e + CPS\n18. In most developing countries, however, the exogenous monetary emission will reflect the\nrevaluation of reserves (IR*e), without any stock movement, in periods of chronic devaluation\nof the domestic currency. The origin of monetary emission could be external and yet serve a\ndomestic purpose: financing, in Ecuador, a devaluation (e) of 3 % to 8.5 % per month. A vicious\ncircle is initiated, leading from excess monetary emission to inflation and thence devaluation\nalong with related revaluation of international reserves, leading itself to more monetary emission.\n16 Large surpluses of the balance of payments were at play in Ecuador in 1989 and 1990.\nThese amounts of USD 382 million and USD 402 million, as shown in Table 10, were the\norigin of exogenous monetary emission for these respective years.\nAnnex 4: Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 99\nThe model\n19. Deriving the relation between the fiscal deficit, money creation and debt will thus begin\nwith the following accounting balances of the Central Bank:\n(5) DCg = H -IR*e -CPS (from 4')\n(6) DCg = CFD -EXA* -VEF* -DLg (from 3')\nsubstituting (5) within (6) yields,\n(7) H -IR*e -CPS = CFD -EXA* -VEF* -DLg\nVEF* and DLg were subject to constraints and insignificant over the period 1987-1991 (issuing\nStabilisation Bonds was -17.7 billions of Sucres in 1989). Eliminating these values yields:\n(8) ME -IR*e = H -IR*e = CFD -EXA + CPS\nEquation (8) as it stands, although, no more than accounting, supports with evidence the\neconometric simulation to come.\nTable 9 ECUADOR: COMPARISON BETWEEN BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SURPLUS\nAND MONETARY EMISSION DUE TO RESERVES ACCUMULATION\nUnits 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991\nCommercial surplus of the Mio USS -33,00 619,00 661,00 1003,00 644,00\nbalance of payments .\nCurrent balances Mio USE -1124,00 -536,00 -514,00 -166,00 -4,00\nCapital balances Mio USS 1036,00 517,00 896,00 568,00 630,00\nInternational Reserves Mio US$ -88,00 -19,00 382,00 402,00 163,00\naccumulation (IR 1/\nIr x E (official exchange bn Sucres - -3,70 148490 156570 245.30\nPart of monetary emission 4/\ndue to ir accumulation in bn Sucres 54,20 1478 155,90 245,50\nthe Central Bank 3/\nGlobal money emission bn Sucres - 132,40 190,40 294,70 425,00\n(ME) % 0,00 77,60 53,00 57,60\nExternal origin of ME\nMemo item: Sucres/ 95,00 194,45 77,60 390,00 390,00\nOfficial exchange rate 2/ USS\nSource: Banco Central Del Ecuador\n1/ Excluding revaluation adjustments\n2/ \"Mediante Decreto N\u00b0 50 de agosto 30 de 1988, se fijo la tasa oficial de cambio en S/390,00 por d6lar, que rige dnicamente para\nefectos contables en el balance del Banco Central\" (BCE, Boletfn n' 15 de 1991)\n3/ BCE, Memoria annual 1990,: \"corresponde a cambio contable\".\n4/ BCE, idem: \"Al 31 de diciembre de 1990, la emisi6n monetaria registr6 un saldo de 294,7 billiones de Sucres.

In equation (8), the consolidated fiscal deficit (CFD) is calculated on a cash basis.\nHowever, nominal data on external arrears (EXA) are absent from the statistics. (Moreover,\navailable percentages, in terms of GDP, are sketchy and often arbitrary or questionable, and data\nfrom the Ministry of Finance or from IMF-World Bank differ substantially). To solve this\nproblem, external arrears will enter the regression under the form of a 'dummy' variable, with\nzero-values before 1987 and relative-values from 1987 to 1991. The same conclusions apply to\nthe CPS values (Credit to the Private Sector): National Accounts and IMF data differ in coverage,\nprecluding consistent comparisons. Figures were thus replaced by a broken trend, which also\nprovided for the March 1987 earthquake and the stabilisation policies of 1988-1989. Several\nequations were tested. The best fitted relation is:\n(9) (ME -IR*e) = ao + al CFD + a2 trend (CPS) -a3 EXA\n(al > 0) (a2 > 0) (a3 <0)\nThe coefficients al and a3 are the semi-elasticities of monetary financing with respect to changes\nin the cash consolidated fiscal deficit (accrual deficit minus arrears); al is expected to be\npositive; a3 negative since in case of involuntary additional external financing (i.e. external\narrears) money emission will be complemented and then reduced. The coefficient a2 should be\npositive since additional credit to private sector increases money base Ml. The resulting equation\nyields:\n(10) (ME -IR*e) = +5,128 -0.45 (CFD) + 543.0 trend(CPS) -11,462.2\nEXA\n(0.07) (187) (3,667.2)\n(R2= .84 32 observations; 29 degrees of freedom. The model is\nquarterly distributed from 1-1984 to IV-1991. Trimestrialisation are calculated upon the Lisman\nand Sandee method)\n21. The results show that both fiscal deficit (CFD) and external arrears (EXA) have a strong\nand significant impact on the endogenous money emission (ME-IR*e): global elasticity is high\nwith respect to cash consolidated fiscal deficit. Signs of the coefficients are as expected : al is\npositive since CFD enters the regression with negative values (-al .-CFD > 0). Errors are not\nautocorrelated, multicollinearities are weak.\nMonetary Impact Simulation\n22. Simulation is based on the scenario that eliminates the whole oil-and-power-subsidies for\n1991 (575 billions of Sucres). It brings an equivalent additional amount in public revenues. Under\nthis scenario, the consolidated fiscal deficit (CFD) disappears as a whole (on an accrual basis),\ncoming from a gap of -510.2 bn Sucres to a fiscal surplus of +64.8 bn Sucres (the absolute\nvariation is -112.7 as compared with the initial deficit). The magnitude of the monetary impact\nconsecutive to the restoration of the above fiscal surplus is calculated using equation (10).\nCalculation is performed on the domestic or endogenous monetary emission (ME-IR*e), i.e. the\npart of the monetary emission covering public gap. For 1991, calculation shows that the -112.7\nAnnex 4: Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 101\nabsolute variation in fiscal deficit yields to a 129.5 per cent reduction in (ME-IR*e), which\nrepresents a 1.15 elasticity. Variants are presented in Table 1.\n23. If one-third of the additional public revenues are used to finance social mnitigation policies,\nthence benefits will only be 383 bn Sucres and consolidated fiscal deficit (CFD) will be -127.2\nbn Sucres (if compared with the initial deficit, this reduction = 75 % in absolute figures).\nLowering the fiscal deficit will result in 86.4 per cent absolute reduction in the endogenous\nmonetary emission (ME-IR*e). Both cases (with or without social mitigation policies) demonstrate\na strong 1.15 elasticity between endogenous monetary emission and fiscal deficits. Monetary\nemission reduces more than fiscal deficit does. There is a multiplicative virtuous effect of cutting\ndown public deficit, in a debt situation.\nV. MEASUREMENT OF THE DEFLATIONARY IMPACT\nEmpirical preliminaries .-\n24. Does the monetary impact (consequent to setting prices at their economic level) translate\nitself into a deflationary impact of same magnitude ? Inflation is a complex process. However,\nin case of fiscal deficits coupled with constant ratios of debt to output, the public finance\napproach to inflation becomes relevant to explain short-run as well as long-run sustained\ninflation. Empirically, a strong relation is observed in Ecuador between inflation and monetary\nemission. However, this relation can be dampened or accelerated by business factors. Second,\ngeneral price level reacts to the global monetary emission (Ms), not specifically to the fiscal\nmonetary financing (the endogenous Ms-IR). Monetization of international reserves (IR) is\nimportant too. A technical appendix to this chapter is attached, addressing these two problems\"7.\nMonetary financing of the external debt\n25. The Banco Central del Ecuador often used to monetize its international reserves as an\nindirect way of financing the public external debt. In case of such bookkeeping practice, we\ncould assimilate the global monetary emission (Ms) to the addition of direct and indirect (hidden)\nfiscal monetary financings:\n(11) Ms = (Ms-IR) + IR\nwhere:\n(Ms-IR) = monetary financing of CFD = direct flnancin2\nIR = hidden monetary financing of quasi-fiscal deficits =\nindirect financing (and exogenous monetary emission)\nIdentity (11) means that, in 1988 and 1991 for example, most of the monetary emission (Ms) was\ndevoted to finance the public sector (Table 9).\n'7While many of the considerations in this appendix are not germane to the analysis of energy\nsubsidies, they are attached for the sake for completeness, in case some readers may want to see\nhow equations were formulated and justified.\n102 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\n26. Impact of monetary emission (Ms) on inflation starts with the equilibrium condition on\nthe money market:\n(13) Ms = Md\n= P .y .1/v (P) (Friedman's quantity theory)\n= P .y .m/y (since v = y/m and dP/P = k)\nRearranging terms:\nP Ms .l/y .y/m\nWhere Md is the demand for nominal balances, m the demand for real balances, y the real\nincome, v the velocity of money, P the general price level. Econometric calculation demonstrates\nthat the above price equation'8should capture most of the Ecuadorean money market realities:\n(21c) In PRICE, = -4.84 + 1.151 In ME, -.054 In Trend(y),\n(.048) (.042)\nwhere: PRICE is for P; Trend(y) for y; ME for monetary emission (Ms).\nt = 1-1986 to I-1992. From equation (21c) and identity (11) we can derive:\n(22) In PRICE, = -4.84 + 1.151 In ((ME-IR*e) + IR*e) -.054 In Trend(y)t\nwhere (ME-IR*e) is the monetary financing of the consolidated fiscal deficit; It is the internal\nor endogenous component of monetary emission.\nIR*e is the monetization of international reserves and the external or exogenous component\nof monetary emission; (e) is the current exchange rate, (IR) the international reserves.\n27. As (ME-IR*e) is referred to as the direct fiscal financing, and IR*e as the indirect\nfinancing, any variation in the fiscal deficit, in case of monetization, will affect the global\nmonetary emission (Ms), and thence inflation (P), directlv via (ME-IR*e) and indirectly via IR*e.\nThe direct price impact is a short-run impact, due to the monetization of the cash consolidated\nfiscal deficit (CFD). The indirect impact, due to reserves monetization, could be assimilate to a\nlong-run impact since it occurs only under mutatis mutandis condition: if the current exchange\nrate (e) will be or not stabilised, or if the balance of payments surpluses will be or not sterilised.\nLags will occur. The long-run inflationary impact is the consequence of the external debt of the\nCentral Bank (the accrued quasi-fiscal deficit), which is 50 per cent rescheduled external public\ndebt.\nDirect deflationary impact\n28. Price simulation was performed for the year 1991. Various scenarios are presented in\nTable 1. Thereunder we envisage the case of putting all prices at their economic level. The\nresults show that under this scenario the above-mentioned reduction of 129.5 per cent (as\ncompared with the initial level) in the direct financing of the fiscal deficit (ME-IR*e) will reduce\n\"See technical Appendix\nAnnex 4: Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 103\ninflation as much as 59 %19. Price index will fall from +4,554.9 points (index level in 1991) to\n+1,822 points (simulated 1991 figure). Figures for inflation growth rate will reduce from +50.5\n% (actual 1991 rate) to a +20.2 % growth rate.\nIn case of social mitigation, the related 86 % reduction in the endogenous monetary emission\n(ME-IR*e) will lead to a direct deflationary impact in the order of 40 %. Price index will fall\nfrom +4,554.9 to +2,733 points.\nIndirect or alobal deflationary impact\n29. Global impact on inflation is the result of the whole monetary emission (Ms) or ((ME-\nIR*e) + IR*e). Global price impact is the addition of the direct and indirect impacts. Indirect\nimpact due to the monetization of international reserves IR*e, will performed only after direct\nimpact, due to the financing of the consolidate cash deficit (ME-IR*e) has occurred and will be\na long-run consequence of the direct impact. Taken solely, indirect impact does not make sense.20.\nIn the same way, global price impact will be a long-run process, since involving \"mutatis\nmutandis\" conditions. If easy to calculate, the global impact should nevertheless be envisaged\nwith caution.\n30. The short-run or direct reduction of 59 % in the inflation level, will lead mutatis mutandis\nto lowering the local devaluation process or will allow for the sterilisation of the balance of\npayments' surpluses. Reserves monetization (IR*e) will be slowed or stopped. If the global\nmonetary emission ((ME-IR*e) + IR*e) is eliminated as much as 100 %, simulation shows that\ninflation (P) should be 'theoretically' reduced as much as 134 % from its actual 1991 level. Price\nindex will fall from +4,554.9 points (actual index level for 1991) to 'zero' point (theoretically\nto a -1,548.6 index-point). Inflation growth rate should 'theoretically' be stopped. However,\ncuring low-inflation take times.\n31. In case of social mitigation policies -to give economic adjustments a human face -long-\nrun adjustment of prices will be in the order of -95 % : price index should be reduced from\n+4,554.9 points (actual index level for 1991) to +227.7 points (simulated index-points for 1991).\nInflation growth rate will fall from +50.5 % (actual 1991 rate) to +2.5 %, that is practically no\nmore inflation.\n19 The remainder 41 % inflation are due to the monetization of international reserves: i.e. the\nindirect (or hidden) fiscal financing.\n20 Separate calculations are not easy. The linear regression's coefficient al in equation (22) is\nreferred to as the elasticity of (P) with respect to variation in the whole monetary emission (Ms).\nCalculating the semi-elasticities for, and respective to internal and external components of\nmonetary emission (Ms) asks for more complete statistical data, which were not available.\n104 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nDiscussion\n32. Eliminating both the consolidated fiscal deficit and the monetization of the international\nreserves (after BCE had recovered its monetary functions) will stop the monetary emission. In\nequation (22) Ms = ((ME-IR*e) + IR*e) = 0. Thence, equation (22) yields:\n(23) In PRICE = -4.84 -.054 In TREND(y)\n(aO < O) (a2 < 0)\nDepressed business factors lead in 1991 to a negative price index (-1,548.6) or at least to a zero\nprice index in equation (23). It means that the real Ecuadorean economy is deflate: the private\nsector, referred to as the productive sector, is depressed because unremunerated. Resources are\nmis-allocated. Demand for money (m) is falling to compensate for expected high fiscal-related\ninflation.\n33. In the long-run, some of the direct and indirect sources of inflation could be offset as a\nrational consequence of better resources allocation. First, the elimination of subsidies should help\nthe Banco Central del Ecuador (BCE) to recover its monetary policy function. In fact, a large\nfiscal surplus could provide the Government with the ability to service its own external\nindebtedness. Public external debt should thus be re-transferred to the Central Government. There\nis no reason why the BCE should continue to play a marked role in fiscal and financial\nintermediation. As the paper shows, the BCE does not need to run any deficit, if its only function\nwere that of regulating monetary aggregates. In addition, the BCE should recover sufficient\nresources in order to regulate the monetary consequences of reserve's accumulation due to\nsurpluses of the balance of payments.\n34. Reserve monetization is the other cause of inflation. In fact, two factors can offset the\nmonetary consequences of the accumulation of international resources. First, the net accumulation\nof positive balances in the CBE by the Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS) will compensate the\nbalance of payments' surpluses and the related increase in monetary base. Inflation will be\nreduced. As a result, domestic saving will increase, leading to additional sterilisation of high\npowered money. Second the cure of inflation will restore Ecuadorean competitiveness.\nDepreciation of the local currency will be slowed, as will the related revaluation of the stock of\ninternational monetary reserves. These virtuous circles should lead to successive reduction of\ninflation within an interval between -60 % and -100 %.\nAnnex 4: Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 105\nSTATISTICAL APPENDIX\nTable 10: ECUADOR -ELASTICITY OF PRICES WITH RESPECT TO\nMONETARY EMISSION, 1986-1991\n(Annual growth rates in percent)\n| (End-year values) 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991\ndPrices/Prices 27.3 32.5 85.7 54.2 49.5 49.0\ndMe/ME 28.03 34.72 65.06 43.74 54.79 44.37\nEpm = (dPlP):(dm/M) 0.97 0/93 | 1.31 1.24 0.90 1.10\nTable II: ECUADOR-GDP, MONEY SUPPLY AND MONEY\nVELOCITY, 1986-1991\n(bilions of sucres and ratios)\n1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991\nGDP 1,382.2 1,794.5 3,019.7 5,170.5 8,160.0 1 2,149.2\nMoney Supply (ml) 166.0 219.0 337.6 466.3 709.6 1,039.5\nMl/GDP ratio .12 .12 .11 .09 .087 .085\nMI velocity 8.33 8.17 8.94 11.08 11.50 11.70\nTable 12:ECUADOR -EVOLUTION IN DOMESTIC CREDIT,\nMONEY BASE,1986-1990\nBCE's Domestic Credit\n(in percent of GDP) 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991\nDomestic Credit 15.61 13.88 9.28 7.55 5.91 4.94\nCredit to public sector 1.53 3.42 3.82 2.78 2.09 1.67\nCredit to financial sector 12.01 9.34 4.84 3 3.04 2.61\nCredit to private sector 2.07 1.12 0.62 1.00 0.79 0.66\nMonetary Base (% of GDP) 6.88 l7.49 6.99 5.85 5.79 5.10\nCurrency in circulation 4.31 4.47 4.27 3.33 3.48 3.15\nReserves | 2.58 | 3.02 2.72 2.52 2.30 1.95\nource: Banco Central Del Ecuador (BCE)\nTable 13: ECUADOR -MONETARY EMISSION IN TERMS OF REAL GDP[ (Billions of Sucres) 1984 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1\nMonetary emission (Ms) 37.8 80.2 132.4 190.4 294.7 425.0\nIn % of real GDP 4.7 4.4 4.3 3.6 3.6 3.5\n106 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nAnnex 5\nESMAP/ PROGRAMA CONJUNTO PNUD / BANCO MUNDIAL\nDE ASISTENCIA A LA GESTION DEL SECTOR ENERGETICO\nINVESTIGACION SOBRE EL PRECIO DEL KEREX\nQuito, Agosto 1992\nAnnex 5: Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 107\nINTRODUCCION\nEsta investigaci6n responde a un requerimiento del Sefior Ministro de Energia, para conocer el\ncomportamiento de la oferta, demanda y precio del k6rex.\nLa investigaci6n se realiz6 en base a documentos y estudios realizados anteriormente y a un\ntrabajo de campo en las ciudades de Quito, Guayaquil y Cuenca, en las ferias libres y en los\npuestos fijos de distribuci6n, mediante entrevistas a mas de 200 demandantes y a 12\ndistribuidores.\nLas conclusiones y recomendaciones responden a las vivencias de la investigaci6n de campo y\na la informaci6n sistematizada, proporcionada por Petrocomercial.\nAspiramos que este documento contribuya al esclarecimiento del problema para la toma de\ndecisiones en beneficio del Estado y del bienestar de los consumidores.\n108 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nRESUMEN EJECUTIVO\nEsta investigaci6n fue realizada antes de la expedici6n de las medidas de incremento de precios\nde los combustibles por lo que los precios de venta del kerex que se detectaron tienen como\nreferencia los precios vigentes para esa epoca.\nEn primer lugar, es notoria la drastica reducci6n del consumo de kerex a nivel nacional, de 33.8\nmillones de galones en 1988 a 16.2 en 1991, como consecuencia, por un lado, del propio sistema\nde comercializaci6n restringida y, por otro, del precio del gas licuado de petr6leo que se ha\nmantenido en niveles bajos y que al mismo tiempo ofrece un elevado nivel de confort para los\nusuarios.\nBajo la perspectiva de que el kerex es un combustible estrechamente vinculado al consumo de\nlos sectores populares, ha recibido elevados niveles de subsidio, pero parad6jicamente estos\nsectores se benefician en una reducida proporci6n del mismo al altisimo subsidio extendido al\nGLP. El actual sistema de comercializaci6n consiste en la distribuci6n directa a comunidades,\norganismos publicos de salud, etc, por parte de Petroecuador y, en las ciudades, la venta al\nconsumidor final se localiza en las ferias libres y en puestos especificos.\nEn los centros de distribuci6n existe racionamiento, que en algunos casos restringe la venta a un\nmaximo de dos galones por persona. Este racionamiento ocasiona la formaci6n de largas colas,\nconcurridas por grupos organizados que involucran la participaci6n de toda la familia, incluidos\nmenores de edad y que generalmente acaparan el producto para revenderlo a los consumidores\nfinales a precios que oscilaban entre S/250 y S/650 / gal6n y aun mas, dependiendo de la\ndistancia y el grado de aislamiento del lugar. En el area rural y en areas marginales este producto\nse comercializa aun en botellas, con costos que superaban con creces lo indicado. Estos precios\nactualmente deben ser mucho mas altos, considerando que el precio referencial, que es el del\ndiesel 1, para la venta a las industrias es de S/1460/gal6n a partir del 3 de septiembre, en lugar\ndel anterior de S/630, con lo que se ha ampliado mucho mas el diferencial de precio entre los\ndos productos y por consiguiente existe un mayor incentivo para desviarlo.\nPor otra parte, al ser el precio del diesel 1 considerablemente mas alto que el del kerex, aun antes\ndel 3 de septiembre, se ha consolidado un mercado negro del producto, a traves del cual este\nIlega a un precio mas bajo a las industrias, a la pesca artesanal y a otras actividades productivas.\nExisten evidencias de este fen6meno, asi, de acuerdo a la informaci6n obtenida en los centros\nde distribuci6n de las tres ferias libres de Quito, por ejemplo, las personas que acceden al\ncombustible, adquieren tan solo un 45% del kerex disponible y que efectivamente es vendido en\nesos centros, con lo que se deduce que el remanente es desviado y vendido en sustituci6n del\ndiesel 1 y diesel 2. Igualmente, al obtener promedios de consumo de kerex por hogar,\nrelacionando las ventas de Petroecuador, con el numero de hogares que consumen este\ncombustible, se encontr6 que apenas un 9% esta justificado en terminos de consumo residencial,\npues mientras el numero de hogares que consumian el producto en 1990 represent6 solamente\nel 13% de 1982, el consumo de aquel anio fue un 40% del de 1982. Para 1990 se obtiene un\npromedio de consumo de kerex de 90 galones/mes/hogar, cifra que es exagerada, comparado con\nun promedio estimado de consumo real que no pasa de los 10 galones/mes/hogar.\nAnnex 5: Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 109\nDe lo anterior se deduce que los beneficiarios del subsidio no son en general los consumidores\nde bajos ingresos sino los intermediarios, y los usuarios finales del kerex que lo adquieren mas\nbarato que el diesel 1 (o diesel 2).\nAl momento actual se esta subsidiando dos productos sustitutos para uso dom6stico, el kerex y\nel GLP, lo que no es recomendable en terminos de una sana poiftica de precios, por lo que se\nrecomienda reservar el kerex para el consumo de los grupos de bajos ingresos y con un precio\nrelativo inferior al del GLP, el que debera alcanzar su valor econ6mico en el corto plazo.\nPor otra parte, se precisa reducir el margen entre el precio del kerex y el diesel 1. El nuevo\nprecio del kerex podria encontrarse en el promedio que actualmente estan pagando en realidad\nlos consumidores. La reducci6n del margen desestimularfa el acaparamiento y su venta a los\nsectores productivos. Paralelamente se debe liberalizar la comercializaci6n, de manera que se\ndistribuya nuevamente en las gasolineras y se multipliquen los puestos de distribuci6n en las\nareas marginales de las ciudades y en el area rural, para desestimular el acaparamiento,\npermitiendo que el subsidio produzca un real beneficio social. En las areas rurales donde no ha\npenetrado completamente el GLP existen buenas posibilidades de ampliar la comercializaci6n de\nkerex, en sustituci6n de la paja y la lefia, reduciendo danios ecol6gicos y reduciendo los costos\nen tiempo que significa para el usuario la recolecci6n de este ultimo producto.\nNo puede dejarse a un lado la aplicaci6n de polfticas sociales compensatorias, al mismo tiempo\nque se ejecute el incremento de precios del kerex, entre las que se encuentra el estimular la oferta\nde estufas eficientes de kerosene que ofrezcan mejores condiciones que las actuales y la\naplicaci6n de otros programas de educaci6n, salud, capacitaci6n, empleo temporal, etc.\nPRECIO ACTUAL DEL KEREX: RESULTADOS RELEVANTES DE LA\nINVESTIGACION DE CAMPO EN LAS CIUDADES DE OUITO, GUAYAQUIL Y\nCUENCA\nLa presente investigaci6n se realiz6 durante las primeros dfas de agosto de 1992, antes de la toma\nde medidas econ6micas decretadas por el actual Gobierno, el 3 de septiembre del mismo afno.\nEntre las medidas dictadas esta la relacionada con la elevaci6n del precio de los combustibles.\nAsi, los precios del diesel 1 y diesel 2 subieron de S/.630/gal6n a S/. 1460/gal6n, el del GLP de\nS/.80/kg. fue reajustado a S/.235/kg.; en tanto que el precio del kerex se congel6 en S/.60/gal6n,\nanunciandose su futura desaparici6n del mercado.\nBajo los actuales precios, el diferencial entre el precio del kerex y su sustituto, el diesel 1, se ha\nampliado sustancialmente, pues el precio del primero representa apenas el 4% del precio del\nsegundo, lo que estarfa incentivando en mayor medida el desvfo del kerex con fines diferentes\nal del domestico, y al mismo tiempo asegurando mas elevados margenes de ganancia a los\nintermediarios que participan en la comercializaci6n del producto y a los consumidores finales,\nartesanos, industriales, pescadores, que lo compran a precios mas bajos que el diesel 1.\nLas primeras indagaciones realizadas para establecer los reales beneficiarios del subsidio al kerex\nen las ciudades de Quito, Guayaquil y Cuenca dieron lugar a m6ltiples inquietudes y\n110 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\ncuestionamientos que exigieron modificaciones en la estrategia de investigaci6n. En una primera\ninstancia, aparecia como suficiente la investigaci6n de campo en los sitios de distribuci6n oficial\ndel combustible, especialmente ferias libres, con el prop6sito de poder determinar el numero de\nusuarios, la cantidad demandada y el uso para el que seria destinado el kerex. Sin embargo, la\nexperiencia demostr6 que los datos proporcionados eran s6lo parcialmente ciertos. Este hecho\nescondia un fen6meno subterraneo tan propio de los sectores marginados y/o informales que se\nhan desarrollado prolificamente en anios recientes en el medio urbano del pais. Asi, las denuncias\nrealizadas por varios de los consumidores, sumadas a la informaci6n proporcionada por\nautoridades responsables de la distribuci6n de kerex y transportistas conocedores del medio,\nexigieron un seguimiento de los compradores, cuesti6n que permiti6 establecer la presencia de\ngrupos organizados de especuladores que desviaban el combustible a prop6sitos ajenos a los\ndeclarados en la entrevista. Este desvio se realizaba a vehiculos y/o sitios cercanos a los de\ndistribuci6n en los que era entregado el k6rex a precios muy por encima del nivel fijado\noficialmente.\nEl consumidor final en las ciudades esta constituido, por familias de modestos ingresos y por\npequenios industriales, pequefios empresarios y artesanos que en su afan por reducir costos, son\nabastecidos por un mercado negro del k6rex.\nEl mecanismo utilizado consiste en un convenio entre especulador y grupos familiares de\npequefios ingresos que son encargados de formar largas colas (frecuentemente por mas de 12\nhoras) para acceder al combustible. El convenio termina con la entrega del k6rex al especulador,\ncomprado supuestamente para consumo del hogar. Este ultimo paga por gal6n una cantidad de\naproximadamente tres veces el precio oficial y tiene establecido contactos con los consumidores\narriba nombrados a los que se vendfa el kerex a un precio promedio no inferior a 250 sucres.\nPero estos pequefios empresarios -- entre los que destacan los pescadores artesanales de la costa -\n-, no son los unicos destinatarios del kerex: la cadena se prolonga al abastecimiento de pequefios\npueblos que circundan las ciudades que abastecen finalmente al medio rural, (para alumbrado)\nen donde el combustible es distribuido en botellas (generalmente de menos de un litro) por un\nprecio de hasta 300 sucres/botella, aproximadamente 15 veces superior al oficial.\nCONSUMO DE KEREX EN LAS CIUDADES DE QUITO, GUAYAQUIL Y CUENCA\nLa investigaci6n realizada ha permitido determinar la brusca caida -- al parecer definitiva -- del\nconsumo de kerex a nivel nacional, debido fundamentalmente a cambios en los habitos de\nconsumo de la poblaci6n (sustituci6n con GLP), debido a su bajo precio y al mayor confort que\neste producto ofrece. La informaci6n disponible no deja dudas al respecto: en 1988 el consumo\nnacional alcanzaba a 33.8 millones de galones, que se reduce a 16.2 millones en 1991.\nLas estadisticas mas recientes muestran que esa tendencia, se mantiene: la confrontaci6n del\nconsumo del primer trimestre de 1992 en relaci6n al primer trimestre de 1991 indica una caida,\na nivel nacional, del 39.5%. En las ciudades investigadas, Quito, Guayaquil y Cuenca, el\nconsumo ha disminuido -- siempre comparando el primer semestre de 1992 respecto a su similar\nde 1991 --, en el 56, 47.5 y 24.7 por ciento respectivamente. Actualmente, el consumo en las\ntres ciudades es de aproximadamente 513 mil galones promedio/mes y representa el 62.3% del\nconsumo nacional. (Annex Table 23). Sin ser definitiva, la explicaci6n al parecer radica en el\nAnnex 5: Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 111\ndesvio del k6rex a actividades a las que no esta destinado, como el creciente consumo en la\npequenia industria y la pesca artesanal, que lo utilizan como combustible alternativo al diesel 1,\ncuyo precio es sustancialmente superior al del k6rex. (Annex Table 24).\nDISTRIBUCION A NIVEL POPULAR\nEl kerex es un combustible estrechamente vinculado al consumo de los sectores populares. En\nesta perspectiva, con el prop6sito de no afectar la economia de los hogares de menores ingresos,\nel k6rex mantiene altos niveles de subsidio gubernamental. Con la intenci6n de incentivar su\nconsumo, el Gobierno anterior aplic6 un programa de distribuci6n en las liamadas \"ferias libres\",\ndonde se supone acuden a realizar sus compras las familias de bajos ingresos. Paralelamente se\nelimin6 la distribuci6n en las gasolineras, con la finalidad de evitar el desvio a la industria, en\nsustituci6n del diesel 1. Sin embargo, estos objetivos no se estan cumpliendo, al contrario, se\nha conformado un sistema de venta restringida que ha dado lugar al acaparamiento.\nEn la ciudad de Quito, semanalmente se realizan tres ferias libres en los barrios Gatazo, Marin\ny La Ofelia. Con el prop6sito de investigar la distribuci6n de kerex a nivel popular y determinar\nsi se esta cumpliendo el prop6sito social del subsidio al combustible, se destacaron grupos de\ninvestigadores a los tres sitios de distribuci6n, con los resultados que se observan en el Annex\nTable 25.\nDe la informaci6n de este cuadro, se desprende que semanalmente se distribuyen, en los tres\nsitios, 6600 galones. Sin embargo, menos de 3000 galones (es decir un 45.4%) son distribuidos\ndirectamente a los aproximadamente 400 demandantes que acuden a los sitios de distribuci6n.\nDesagregando esta informaci6n puede destacarse que a la feria de Gatazo asisten para\naprovisionarse de k6rex alrededor de 113 personas, 115 asisten a La Marin y 167 lo hacen a La\nOfelia. Los volumenes de k6rex a los que tienen acceso estas personas (especialmente nifios) son\n1068, 1136 y 791 galones respectivamente en las tres ferias libres, que representan el 48.5, el\n47.3 y el 39.5% del total de combustible que se destina a los tres sitios indicados.\nCuando las personas que acuden, formando largas colas, a proveerse de kerex son preguntadas\nsobre el uso que daran al combustible, se estima que aproximadamente el 69% responde que es\npara cocinar; el 12% lo destinara al alumbrado, el 7% lo utilizard para el calentamiento de agua\npara bafios. En porcentajes menores, el k6rex serd utilizado en la fabricaci6n de cera para pisos\n(4%), para el aseo directo de pisos (2%), en labores de fundici6n (4%) y en otras actividades el\n2%. (Annex Table 25).\nEn funci6n del volumen que se destina a cada uno de los usos descritos, se encuentra que el\n31%, el 29% y el 18% se utiliza para \"cocina\", \"banos\" y fabricaci6n de cera, respectivamente.\nLas actividades restantes consumen volumenes menores (Annex Table 25).\nRespecto a los precios de venta a nivel de tanqueros en las ferias libres, se obtuvo un promedio\nde S/68/gal6n en las diferentes ciudades observadas. (Annex Table 26). Sin embargo, el precio\npromedio de consumidor final es de S/337/gal6n con un rango que fluctua entre S/250 y\nS/650/gal6n, dependiendo de la ciudad y distancia en que se ubica el consumidor final.\n112 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nASPECTOS RELEVANTES DE LA INVESTIGACION\nDe acuerdo a la informaci6n obtenida en los centros de distribuci6n, las personas que\ndirectamente acceden al combustible adquieren menos de la mitad del k6rex disponible, vendido\nnormalmente en las ferias libres. Hubo que preguntarse, entonces, sobre el destino del diferencial\nentre el volumen total de kerex destinado a la distribuci6n (6600 galones) y el adquirido por los\nconsumidores (2995 galones).\nDe entrevistas a funcionarios responsables y a personas conocedoras y ligadas al mercado del\nkerex, pudo establecerse la existencia de un mercado negro o mercado secundario que distribuye\nel k6rex a distintas actividades productivas que legalmente (al no ser destinatarias del subsidio)\ndeberfan adquirir diesel 1 para sus actividades.\nDebido a denuncias recibidas y al comentario generalizado sobre el desvlo del producto, se hizo\nun seguimiento de algunos compradores. Como resultado de esta especie de \"pesquizaje\" pudo\ndeterminarse la veracidad de las denuncias presentadas, dandose casos -- los mas evidentes -- en\nlos que a muy corta distancia de los sitios de distribuci6n se hallaban ubicados otros en los que\nera entregado gran parte del combustible adquirido, cuyo volumen es dificil de cuantificar por\nobvias razones.\nEsta realidad permite destacar los siguientes aspectos:\nEl numero de beneficiarios directos contabilizados en las ferias libres es mas bien\nreducido y s6lo representa un pequefno porcentaje de las familias de bajos ingresos,\nincluso en relaci6n con las residentes en los barrios perifericos donde se realizan las ferias\nlibres.\nAlrededor del 80 por ciento del combustible destinado a beneficiar a las familias de\nmenores ingresos de la ciudad -- de acuerdo a las investigaciones realizadas -- es desviado\na prop6sitos distintos a los originales.\nLas investigaciones han permitido detectar la presencia de grupos de personas -\nvinculadas al mercado secundario -que acuden a comprar kerex a los tres sitios de\nrealizaci6n de las ferias libres en Quito, utilizando familiares -frecuentemente nifnos -\npara que les guarden puesto en las \"colas\".\nLas razones que explican este fen6meno son varias:\nLas \"colas\" se forman en los sitios de distribuci6n, la noche anterior al de las ferias libres,\nsituaci6n a la que en general no estan dispuestas las familias que requieren semanalmente\nde 2 o 3 galones de kerex, quienes prefieren comprar el combustible a los revendedores,\na un precio mas alto sin movilizarse, compensando asf el costo del transporte desde otro\nbarrio o desde pueblos aledafios al sitio de distribucion, y el tiempo muerto de espera.\nLa diferencia significativa de precios entre el k6rex y el diesel 1, y la venta en un\nreducido numero de sitios, ha dado paso a la conformaci6n de un mercado ilegal o\nsecundario, en el que se revende kerex a precios que fluctuan entre 250 y 650 sucres el\nAnnex 5: Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 113\ngal6n (Annex Table 26) dependiendo del lugar de venta, de su distancia del lugar original\nde distribuci6n y del numero de intermediarios. La investigaci6n ha demostrado que la\npoblaci6n mas castigada por este fen6meno es la campesina, a la que Ilega el kerex a un\nprecio aproximado de 500 sucres el gal6n y aun mayor en zonas distantes y aisladas.\nEl mercado secundario al que se hace referencia, tiene como sustento a grupos bien\norganizados de especuladores que acaparan el kerex para su posterior venta al consumidor\nfinal, constituido por lo general por pequeiios industriales, familias que utilizan el k6rex\ncomo combustible y poblaci6n campesina para el alumbrado.\nSe ha podido establecer que quienes conforman las \"colas\" para la compra del kerex,\naunque declaren que sera utilizado en fines domesticos, en realidad lo adquieren con\nprop6sitos especulativos. En forma paralela, ha sido posible detectar que actualmente, en\nla ciudad de Quito, son muy pocas familias -con tendencia decreciente -las que aun\nutilizan cocinas a kerex. Explican este criterio generalizado -- dado por la experiencia -\n-de que las cocinas a k6rex, a mas de las molestias que causan, tienen una durabilidad\nmucho menor que las cocinas a gas (G.L.P.); ademas el costo del k6rex en el mercado\nsecundario es similar, para fines de cocci6n, al del gas licuado por lo que en la actualidad\nen forma generalizada se utiliza G.L.P.; la restringida comercializaci6n del k6rex\ndesincentiva su uso.\nESTIMACION DEL CONSUMO DE KEREX EN EL SECTOR DOMESTICO\nSi se analizan los datos correspondientes a las ventas de kerex registradas por\nPETROECUADOR, se nota una gran diferencia con las estimaciones del requerimiento\nde este combustible en el sector dom6stico del pais.\nEn efecto, de acuerdo a los resultados de los Censos de Poblaci6n y Vivienda, en 1982\nexistian alrededor de 275 mil viviendas que utilizaban este combustible para la cocci6n\nde alimentos, habiendo disminuido esta cifra considerablemente para 1990, al registrarse\nun total nacional de aproximadamente 35 mil viviendas. Por su parte, las ventas de kerex\nal sector residencial en este mismo lapso, disminuyeron de 99.2 a 39.9 millones de\ngalones, sin considerar las cifras correspondientes a las ventas a instituciones publicas.\nEn terminos relativos, esto implica que mientras la cantidad de hogares que consumieron\nkerex en 1990 fue de tan s6lo el 13% del nuimero registrado en 1982, el volumen vendido\nde este combustible represent6 en 1990 el 40% del valor registrado en 1982 (Annex\nTables 27 a 31), de lo que no puede deducirse que el consumo por familia ha aumentado\npara 1990, sino que mas bien se esta produciendo un desvio a otros sectores, pues resulta\nimposible que el consumo por hogar se haya incrementado en mas de 4 veces durante este\nperiodo de analisis .\nSi se considera que el consumo especifico de kerex por habitante no supera los 2\ngalones/mes, en los hogares que utilizan este combustible (segun datos de encuestas\nrealizadas en el sector), se estima que unicamente el 34.5% de las ventas realizadas en\n1982 correspondieron a la demanda del sector residencial, con tamaino promedio de hogar\nde cinco miembros.\n114 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nPara 1990 la situaci6n es mucho mas crftica, pues de acuerdo a los datos reales obtenidos,\nel consumo por vivienda serfa de 94 galones por mes (205 gal./mes en la zona norte y 81\ngal./mes en la zona sur), es decir, mAs de 22 galones por habitante/mes. Con estas cifras,\ny si se considera el consumo estimado por habitante (2 gal./mes), resulta que durante este\nafio solamente el 9% de las ventas realizadas se destinaron al sector residencial.\nDurante 1991 y 1992 la situaci6n es similar. Las ventas de kerex en el sector domestico\nhabrfan disminufdo en un 62% en 1991, respecto al afio anterior, ubicandose en alrededor\nde 15 millones de galones. La estimaci6n del numero de hogares demandados en este aino\n(27 mil viviendas, de acuerdo a la tendencia intercensal), indica un requerimiento total\nde 2.66 millones de galones, es decir, alrededor del 18% de las ventas contabilizadas. Si\nse relacionan las cifras de las ventas producidas en cada zona con el numero de hogares\nque consumen este combustible, los promedios de 1992 indican consumos mensuales de\nalrededor de 140 y 22 galones/vivienda, para los distritos norte y sur, respectivamente,\nlo cual representa consumos especificos de mas de 7.7 galones/habitante/mes.\nCONCLUSIONES OUE SE DESTACAN\nEn la actualidad, las familias con pequefios recursos, en favor de quienes se mantiene en\nprincipio el subsidio del kerex, no se benefician -sino en muy corta medida -del bajo\nprecio de ese combustible. En el mejor de los casos, el porcentaje de familias\nbeneficiadas por el subsidio, no supera el 0.2% de los hogares quitefios y no es mayor\nal 1% de los hogares pobres de la ciudad. Esta realidad, con pocas diferencias, es similar\nen ei resto del pais.\nSi la investigaci6n es concluyente en el sentido de que quienes realmente se benefician\ndel subsidio al kerex son los usuarios industriales de k6rex que lo compran mas barato\nque el diesel 1, ademas se beneficia a grupos bien organizados de especuladores y\nrevendedores, que en el proceso de comercializaci6n en el mercado secundario obtienen\nutilidades. Por otra parte esta actividad se ha constituido tambien en una estrategia de\nsuperviviencia de los grupos de bajos ingresos que especulan con pequeiias cantidades del\nproducto.\nAbandonando el ambito de las ciudades, se ha comprobado que un alto porcentaje de\nconsumo de k6rex en la costa ecuatoriana, se orienta a la pesca artesanal, que lo utiliza\ncomo altemativa al diesel 1.\nPor la marcada tendencia a la caida del consumo de kerex y su sustituci6n generalizada\npor el G.L.P., a mds de las razones que se han anotado, es dificil pensar en un programa\nque se plantee la generalizaci6n del consumo de k6rex a nivel familiar en los barrios\npopulares del medio urbano del pais, al menos en las circunstancias actuales de precio\nrelativamente bajo del gas licuado. Parecerfa conveniente plantear una iniciativa similar\nque beneficie al medio rural ecuatoriano, en donde las pautas de consumo citadino agn\nno tienen arraigo, dado que un 57% de la distribuci6n se lo hace en comunidades del\nsector rural o a trav6s de 218 puestos de distribuci6n que representa el 57% del volumen\ndistribufdo. Se necesita por tanto una mayor investigaci6n de lo que estA ocurriendo en\nel medio rural. (Annex Table 32).\nAnnex 5: Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 115\nLlama la atenci6n la irregularidad en la oferta de kerex en todas las ciudades, para junio\nde 1992 se habia proyectado una distribuci6n mensual de 538.000 galones a traves de las\nferias libres, habiendose distribufdo solamente 125.847 galones, que representa solamente\nel 23% de esa oferta te6rica. (Annex Table 33).\nPara los hogares que auin consumen kerex en el medio urbano, su costo finalmente resulta\nmas oneroso, pues en el mejor de los casos -dadas las condiciones de distribuci6n -\ndeben pagar por un gal6n de k6rex 400 sucres, costo similar o muy cercano al de gas\nlicuado de petr6leo (5 galones de kerex significarfan 2000 sucres, en tanto que 15Kgr. de\nG.L.P. tiene un precio de s/1500 a domicilio) (a julio de 1992, aun mas alto al vigente\nen ese mes).\nALGUNAS RECOMENDACIONES\nEs necesaria la elevaci6n inmediata del precio del k6rex, reduciendo asf el enorme\ndiferencial existente con el diesel 1, a fin de ELIMINAR LAS RESTRICCIONES\nACTUALES AL SISTEMA DE COMERCIALIZACION, HACIENDO ASf MAS\nDIFfCIL LA EXISTENCIA DE MONOPOLIOS PARA LA DISTRIBUCION. Debe\nexistir suficiente numero de distribuidores ubicados adecuadamente de conformidad con\nla localizaci6n de la demanda.\nLa distribuci6n deberfa volverse a las gasolineras, y en los lugares donde no existe el\nsuficiente numero de surtidores debera autorizarse distribuidores privados, en condiciones\nque atiendan eficazmente la demanda. Esto ultimo sera generalmente aplicable en Areas\nmarginales de las ciudades y en zonas rurales aisladas.\nParalelamente al incremento de precio se deben implementar programas sociales\ncompensatorios, como la oferta de estufas de kerex mas eficientes que las actuales y\nactividades tendientes a mejorar las condiciones de educaci6n, saneamiento, atenci6n\nprimaria de salud, y pequenia infraestructura productiva a nivel local, apoyo a gesti6n\nmicroempresarial, microempleo, etc. A los pescadores artesanales se les deberfa\ncompensar mediante proyectos tendientes a organizarse, a mejorar sus tecnicas de captura\ny procesamiento en tierra, asi como apoyarles en las fases de transporte y\ncomercializaci6n.\nSin embargo, por consideraciones sociales, el incremento del precio del kerex a nivel del\ndiesel 1 no puede hacerse de inmediato, por lo que se propone que en primera instancia,\nel precio se eleve al nivel del promedio que actualmente estAn pagando en la realidad los\nconsumidores, precio que refleja la voluntad de pagar de estos, dadas sus necesidades.\nEsto se debera hacer siempre y cuando se consiga la eliminacion de los actuales\nacaparadores. De lo contrario solamente se estaria garantizando margenes mas elevados\npara ellos.\nPor otra parte, es preciso considerar el precio del kerex, en el contexto de todos los\nprecios de los energeticos, en particular el GLP que es uno de los sustitutos. Este se\nencuentra todavfa subsidiado por lo que en un futuro debera alcanzar su valor econ6mico.\n116 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nSi el incremento del precio del GLP en las magnitudes anotadas se produce,\nimplicitamente se estarfa reservando al kerex como un producto orientado a los consumos\nde los grupos de bajos ingresos y con un precio relativo inferior al de aquel; puesto que\nno conviene en terminos de una sana poiftica de precios de los energeticos, el subsidiar\ndos productos sustitutos como ocurre actualmente.\nUna forma de superar las distorsiones que se vienen comentando, serfa la de ampliar e\nintensificar la distribuci6n de kerex a las parroquias aledafias a las ciudades y al medio\nrural en las que existe una mayor demanda y mejores posibilidades de desarrollo de un\nmercado potencialmente significativo. De otra parte, un sistema de distribuci6n libre\neliminaria el desarrollo de actividades especulativas, permitiendo que el subsidio cumpla\nsu prop6sito de beneficio social.\nEn los medios rural y campesino, en los que aun no se ha difundido el consumo de gas\nlicuado y/o kerex, seria conveniente y provechoso la comercializaci6n del kerex como\ncombustible alternativo y sustitutivo de la paja, la lefia y el carb6n, evitando mayores\ndafios ecol6gicos provocados por la deforestaci6n.\nAnnex 5: Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 117\nDESCRIPCION DE LUGARES VISITADOS\nQuito\nEn la ciudad de Quito se investig6 en las ferias libres de La Ofelia, Marian y La Gatazo, tambien\nse hizo una observaci6n en los puestos fijos de la Ermita y las Calles Bogota y Uruguay.\nLas personas consultadas, en las tres partes, manifestaron que su residencia la tienen en: San\nRoque, Turubamba, Hospital del Sur, Nanegal, La Tola, San Blas, Vicentina, Tejar, Monjas, Villa\nFlora, San Bartolo, La Marfn, San Juan, Recreo, Clader6n, Amaguafia, Solanda, Placer, Puengasf,\nLuluncoto, Atahualpa, Tanasa, Ferroviaria Baja, Guajal6, Calacali, Puembo y San Jos6 de Minas.\nEsto nos demuestra que los demandantes son de los barrios perif6ricos y de las parroquias\naledafias al Quito Metropolitano.\nEl destino que le dan al kerex, es para cocina, piso, alumbrado, mecanica, tratamiento de la\nmadera, calefacci6n bafios, industrializaci6n de la cera para pisos, etc.\nEn estos puestos se detect6 que existe una cadena de intermediarios que estan bien organizados\ny se apoyan mutuamente para defenderse de futuros competidores o para obtener mayor cantidad\ndel combustible, ellos lo revenden a intermediarios que lo receptan en camionetas a s/1 50 o s/250\nel gal6n. Estos acaparadores distribuyen a su vez en algunas pequefias industrias y en los\npueblos aledafios y los duefnos de tiendas pequenias a un precio que oscila entre 300 y 400 sucres.\nLos pequefios intermediarios (primeros) tienen que hacer cola desde el dia viernes a las 16 horas\nhasta las 10 horas del sabado en que se distribuye el kerex a sf70.\nEn los puestos fijos por el contrario venden el kerex y el diesel 1 a los siguientes precios 630,\n650 y 700 el gal6n, en estos lugares no existe aglomeraci6n ni agresi6n fisica, como sucede en\nlas ferias libres.\nDe los entrevistados, fue novedad el sistema que ha optado la directiva de una Comuna de San\nJose de Minas. El presidente y el tesorero comprar generalmente 20 galones para distribuirlo a\nlas familias de la comuna a un precio promedio de 200 sucres el gal6n. Estos sefiores sugirieron\nque el kerex en la zona rural deberia distribuirlo la Junta de Agua Potable, porque tienen\nexperiencia en el manejo de dinero publico, esta medida contribuiria a los objetivos que se\npropone el Estado de beneficiar a los estratos pobres. Ellos confiesan tambien que las familias\nde ingresos medios y altos prefieren abastecerse de diesel 1 en vez de kerex. El destino que le\ndan al combustible es para alumbrado, cocina y motores.\nCuando se les consult6 si estarian de acuerdo en que el kerex se expenda en las bombas el 90%\nse manifest6 positivamente.\nLa capacidad de los tanqueros que acuden a estos lugares es de 800 galones, pero s6lo\ndistribuyen las tres cuartas partes, la diferencia no pudieron explicar, se infiere que esa cantidad\nla venden a los especuladores.\n118 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution\nGuayaquil\nEn la ciudad de Guayaquil se investig6 el sistema de distribuci6n de kerex en Pascuales,\nFrancisco Jacome y el recinto denominado \"Tres Postes\".\nEn Pascuales hay un dep6sito que expende permanentemente, mediante un convenio con\nPetrocomercial el distribuidor obtiene por concepto de arriendo del local la cantidad de S/60000\nmensuales, mas adecuaciones del inmueble. En este lugar se ven de entre 450 y 550 galones a\n300 personas en promedio por dia. (son compradores de todos los dias entre hermanos y madres\nde familia).\nLas personas entrevistadas manifiestan que el kerex lo utilizan en la cocina (67%), en tratamiento\nde la madera, (8%), en mecanicas, (5%), para desinfecci6n (6%), para quemar basura (7%), y\npara alumbrado (7%). De las 300 personas que hicieron cola el dia sabado 8 de agosto, el 46%\nson menores de edad (13 -16 afios), son quienes venden inmediatamente a uno de los\nintermediarios, o lo venden en el muelle a pequefias embarcaciones que se dedican a la pesca.\nLas personas mayores de edad protestan porque la medida del gal6n no es completa, de s/60.00.\nEste problema tambi6n lo comparten los choferes de los tanqueros que dicen que a ellos tambien\nles\nentregan menos en el lugar de abastecimiento. (Los tanqueros reciben de Petrocomercial medido\npor varilla).\nEn Francisco Jacome, lugar importante de distribuci6n, el Sefior Mancero, Director del Programa\nde Distribuci6n del Kerex de Petrocomercial, en la provincia del Guayas, manifest6 \"en base a\nsu experiencia, que calcula que aquf el 80% de los compradores son revendedores, razon por la\nque se vende racionado, maximo dos galones por persona\", en 6sta actividad de reventa participan\npor lo menos 30 familias, cuya responsabilidad esta a cargo de los ninios y las mujeres.\nEn el Recinto \"Los Tres Postes\", hay un lugar de expendio controlado por Petrocomercial, previo\nconvenio con un representante de la poblaci6n quien esta encargado de distribuir a las\npoblaciones rurales pero estos dfas no esta operando, porque los responsables manifiestan que el\nprograma esta paralizado hasta que el nuevo gobierno tome nuevas decisiones. En lugares\naledafios 5 kil6metros de este lugar expenden en tiendas 6 cobachas pequefnas a s/400 el litro,\ncuyos habitantes lo utilizan para alumbrado, quemar basura o como desinfectante.\nEn Guayas existen 63 convenios para distribuci6n en el sector rural. En cada poblaci6n existe\nun responsable quien generalmente es un lider de la parroquia o resinto, o quien ha trabajado por\nalgdn candidato ganador. Generalmente el responsable de distribuci6n se convierte en el major\nacaparador del combustible para beneficio personal en reventa.\nCuenca\nEn la ciudad de Cuenca, se visit6 la Feria del Arenal, la feria de Tatoracocha, el Sector de la\nCarcel, San Sebastfan y Banios de Cuenca, los resultados no fueron tan halagadores por la fecha\nespecial de cambio de gobierno, que esta incidiendo en estos dias -en un cambio diametral de\nlos precios, fluctuando entre 400 y 600 sucres el gal6n de kerex. Esta actitud ha inclinado a los\ndemandantes urbanos a consumir diesel 1 que lo expenden a s/650.00 en cantidad suficiente y\nAnnex 5: Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 119\nsin atropellos en la bomba del Mercado 9 de Octubre. Algunas de las personas consultadas,\nmanifiestan que serfa loable que se distribuya el kerex en el campo en mayor volumen, y en las\nciudades se debe incrementar los puestos de distribuci6n en los barrios populares, pero no estan\nde acuerdo en que se venda en las bombas de gasolina, porque adulteran otros productos (debido\nal elevado diferencial entre el k6rex y los demds productos).\nEn la ciudad de Cuenca, al igual que en Quito y Guayaquil, hay familias que se han dedicado\ndesde hace tres afios aproximadamente a esta actividad de reventa del kerex. Hay dos\nmodalidades de distribuci6n, la una en las ferias libres y la otra en puestos fijos. En las ferias\nlibres se realizan el viemes, ese dia los revendedores compran a s/60 el gal6n y de lunes a jueves\ncompran en los puestos fijos a s/70; para ello tienen que acudir a las 3 horas a ganar tumo (les\nponen numeros en el antebrazo derecho) para proveerse de cuatro galones, para revenderlos a los\n\"camioneteros\" a 150 a 200 sucres. Esta transacci6n les genera una utilidad de aproximadamente\n36.000 sucres que significa el 61% del Salario Minimo Vital (SMV).\nLos \"caminoneteros\", como los conocen, entregan el kerex a s/400 en mecanicas, lugares que dan\ntratamiento a la madera, planteles avicolas, tiendas pequefias y rurales.\nEsto puede ser una explicaci6n del descenso de la demanda de Diesel 1, en la industria, en donde\ntambi6n existen cupos para distribuci6n por parte de Petrocomercial a este sector.\nLos demandantes potenciales son los indigenas que utilizan en la cocina y alumbrado. Las\npersonas consultadas en la zona periferica de Cuenca atestiguan que el gal6n de kerex se vende\na 400 y 500 sucres el gal6n, y en lugares mas alejados a un precio mayor.\nEn las ferias, los tenderos condicionan la venta del kerex, es factible siempre y cuando compren\notros productos fundamentales como la sal, arroz, azucar, manteca y jab6n. Para estos tenderos\nla botella de kerex (litro) es parte de la canasta basica.\nOtras ciudades\nBajo otras modalidades, se investig6 el precio de venta del kerex en las ferias libres y en puestos\nde distribuci6n fijos, en las ciudades de Ibarra, Latacunga, Cayambe, Balsapamba, Bolivar, en\nlas cuales se comprueba que la tendencia de la distorsi6n del precio del kerex que existen\nespeculadores y que el precio promedio del kerex es de s/364, es decir, mas de seis veces el\nprecio original.\nINTERNAL PRICES CALCULATED USING Cif PRICES PLUS KARKETING COSTS AND MARGINS TABLE 1\nJuly, 1992\nMKTG\nEOUIV CIF CIF COSTS MARGINS MARGINS PRICE PRICE\nBarr/lon US/Ton USc/gallon USc/gaLLon S//gallon USc/gallon USc /gall S//gallon\nPremium Gasoline 8.75 242.5 65.99 5.404 34.50 2.26 73.65 1,123\nSpecial GasolIne 8.75 222.0 60.41 5.404 25.50 1.67 67.4d 1,029\nRegular Gasoline 8.75 219.0 59.59 5.404 4.70 0.31 65.30 996\nK6rex 7.81 217.0 66.15 5.404 2.18 0.14 71.70 1,093\nDiesel 7.31 191.0 62.21 5.404 24.50 1.61 69.22 1,056\nFuel Oil 6.58 93.5 33.83 5.404 39.24 598\nLPG 11.65 267.0 54.57 5.404 42.84 2.81 62.78 957\nExchange Rate, July 1.
