But are Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) skin tones a minority? Definitely not.\nImage credit: Beautystreams\n[Well+Good](https://www.wellandgood.com/diversity-within-skin-care-industry/) points out that 63 percent of women of color in a 2,000-person survey said they felt ignored by the industry, and that there aren\u2019t enough effective products for them. \u201cMelanin-rich skin is more susceptible to discoloration and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) than Caucasian skin, yet over-the-counter products that work to treat these issues in darker skin tones are few and far between,\u201d Well+Good writes. Bustle says, \u201cUntil more inclusive research into all skins of color becomes a reality, darker-skinned women not only have to struggle with mainstream beauty standards that have traditionally catered more to lighter skin \u2014 they also have to navigate racist standards and beliefs about what skin type is more desirable.\u201d\nWith inclusion finally at the crucial core of industry discussion, it\u2019s time for brands to put the movement to work in formulation. In order to do that, we all have to first understand BIPOC skin better. In simple terms, skin color is determined by the amount of melanin in the skin. Darker skin tones have a higher melanin content, which provides stronger photoprotection, leading to less photoageing. Meaning, dark-skinned people typically do not start wrinkling until 10 to 20 years later, since they have a compact dermis in the deep layer of the skin, with more active cells and a stronger collagen network. On the other hand, people of color are also twice as likely to have sensitive skin and melanin-producing cells may be more susceptible to the effects of inflammation and injury. Oily skin is the most common since the secretion of sweat glands is greater in this type of skin. Thus, it favors the appearance of acne and folliculitis.\nAt Sensient, we understand every concern and from our extensive portfolio, here are a few natural, inclusive beauty ingredients that address specific skin concerns\u2014such as hyperpigmentation, uneven tone and dry skin\u2014for people of color.\n[Natpure\u00ae Xtra Integrity](https://www.sensient-cosmetics.com/product/natpure-xtra-integrity/)\nOur Natpure\u00ae Xtra line is composed of sustainably sourced, highly concentrated botanical extracts obtained through our patented PhytoClean\u2122 process for pure, repeatable extraction. Made from guayusa leaf extract, Natpure\u00ae Xtra Integrity supports skin barrier integrity by restoring proteins that are essential for barrier reinforcement and anti-inflammation. Maintaining skin integrity and minimizing inflammation can help to reduce hyperpigmentation in darker skin that has more melanocytes.\n[Natpure\u00ae Xtra Vitalidad](https://www.sensient-cosmetics.com/product/natpure-xtra-vitality/)\nAs the body\u2019s largest organ and a vital roadblock against the outside world, the skin helps regulate body temperature, prevent dehydration and safeguard against pathogens. However, daily exposure to pollutants indoors and out can weaken the skin\u2019s ability to perform these functions while accelerating visible skin aging.\nOne of the top plant-based ingredients known for its anti-pollution properties is rosemary extract, from the distinctively aromatic herb in the peppermint family. Sensient\u2019s Natpure\u00ae Xtra Vitality rosemary botanical active is proven to enhance epidermis barrier function while simultaneously fighting daily pollution with high phytochemical levels.\n[Natpure\u00ae Xtra Longevidad](https://www.sensient-cosmetics.com/product/natpure-xtra-longevity/)\nAmong the long list of highly touted antioxidants, one stands out as perhaps the best-known: green tea. Our in-vitro research at Sensient found green tea to be as effective as vitamin E in antioxidant power, shown by an 80 percent reduction in sunburn cells. Additionally, green tea significantly increased filaggrin, known to hydrate skin. The edge of Kenya\u2019s Great Rift Valley is home to rolling hills of green tea leaves used in our Natpure\u00ae Xtra Longevity green tea extract. The mineral-rich volcanic soil, high altitude, and temperate climate make for ideal conditions, while our partner farm supports education, opportunity and prosperity in the community.\n[Natpure\u00ae Xtra Eternity](https://www.sensient-cosmetics.com/product/natpure-xtra-eternity/)\nConsumers of all skin colors have long sought anti-aging products to feel young, good-looking and age-defying. During the coronavirus pandemic, stress, worry and anxiety are making many people feel like they are aging faster than ever. Theobroma cacao, aka the cocoa tree, is known not only as a source of chocolate, but also for topical skin care benefits. Cocoa bean extract has shown firming, smoothing and moisturizing effects on skin.\nIn Natpure\u00ae Xtra Eternity, the highest quality Criollo cocoa beans work to strengthen natural defenses against skin aging by targeting the dermis and epidermis. In the dermis, Natpure\u00ae Xtra Eternity decreases extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation enzymes to smooth and firm skin. In the epidermis, it reinforces cornification to limit water evaporation and prevent flaky skin. Natpure\u00ae Xtra Eternity received the PCHi 2020 Skin Barrier Repair Award.\n[Covasterol](https://www.sensient-cosmetics.com/product/covasterol/)\nDark skin can be more prone to oil and acne. Covasterol, a blend of plant phytosterols in place of lanolin, can provide moisturization, hydration, skin comfort and smoothness all at once. This ingredient is proven to reduce sebum production and pore size in 7 days. It also adds a luxurious creaminess to certain formulas.\n[Carb\u00f3n vegetal](https://www.sensient-cosmetics.com/product/vegetable-charcoal/)\nDaily cleansing is essential for anyone\u2019s skin. But for sensitive skin, it\u2019s important to deliver a formula that won\u2019t strip moisture even with frequent use. Sensient\u2019s activated carbon vegetable charcoal powder provides high absorption to deeply remove dirt from the skin, leaving it feeling ultra-clean and refreshed. Extracted from European peatlands, our vegetable charcoal is 100% natural and COSMOS certified.\nInclusivity in skin care formulation is essential and has been overlooked for too long. We must continue to do better. Sensient is committed to diversity and inclusion on a global scale\u2014not just in our own corporate culture and partnerships, but also in our ingredients, formulations and industry leadership.\n[Contact us](https://www.sensient-cosmetics.com/contact/) to learn more about our skin care portfolio for inclusive beauty.", "language": null, "image":
