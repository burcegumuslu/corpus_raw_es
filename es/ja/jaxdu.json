It's free.\nEmergent BioSolutions\u2019 new anthrax vaccine contains dangerous toxins and may cause severe side effects, according to the product\u2019s\n[package insert](https://www.fda.gov/media/170445/download).\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which\n[approved the vaccine last week](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/fda-approves-cyfendus-anthrax-vaccine-adults/), posted the package insert late Friday.\n\u201cIs this a label or a cartoon?\u201d asked\n[Meryl Nass, M.D.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/meryl-nass-md/), a bioterrorism and anthrax expert who published an analysis of the insert on [Substack](https://merylnass.substack.com/p/the-new-anthrax-vaccine-cyfendus). \u201cYou can\u2019t make this stuff up,\u201d she said.\nThe insert reports that Cyfendus uses two adjuvants, an aluminum\n[adjuvant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023785/) and a new synthetic adjuvant \u2014 CPG7909. The vaccine also contains a saline solution containing [formaldehyde](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde) and [benzethonium chloride](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/benzethonium-chloride) as preservatives. [Aluminum adjuvant](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/child-health-topics/known-culprit/aluminum/institutional-inertia-is-enough-being-done-to-protect-children-from-aluminum-toxicity/) is a known [ cytotoxic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23856122/) and [ neurotoxic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19568732/) substance used to induce autoimmunity in lab animals.\nPeer-reviewed research published in\n[Neuromolecular Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17114826/) linked the aluminum adjuvant in the existing anthrax vaccine to Gulf War Illness (GWI), a cluster of symptoms including muscle aches, joint pain, dizziness, memory lapses, headaches, fatigue, insomnia, emotional disorders, posttraumatic stress reactions, headaches, and memory loss.\nHundreds of thousands of Gulf War veterans suffered with GWI, but so did many troops who were never deployed but who had also been vaccinated against anthrax \u2014 which led researchers to\n[study the vaccine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10198799/) as a likely cause of the illness.\nAccording to\n[The BMJ](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/26/6/285), aluminum adjuvants are associated with numerous adverse effects, including injection site pain and tenderness, persistent lumps, [ granulomas](https://www.osmosis.org/answers/granulomas), contact dermatitis, post-immunization headache, [ macrophagic myofasciitis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/macrophagic-myofasciitis) and autoimmune/inflammatory syndromes.\nResearch has also found a strong link between aluminum exposure and\n[asthma](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/aluminum-childhood-vaccines-asthma-cola/), [Alzheimer\u2019s disease](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/aluminum-exposure-brain-alzheimers-disease-cola/) and [autism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763).\nFormaldehyde is a known carcinogen and benzethonium chloride, an ammonium compound often found in detergents, is\n[highly toxic if ingested](https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/19856).\nToo few cases worldwide to test for efficacy\nThe new\n[Cyfendus](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/cyfendus) vaccine is an updated version of Emergent\u2019s [BioThrax](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/biothrax), also known as [Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed](https://www.fda.gov/media/71954/download), which the company has been producing since 2002.\nEmergent said prior to last week\u2019s approval, it had been delivering Cyfendus to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) since 2019, under\n[ pre-emergency use authorization status](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53122/).\nCyfendus is approved only for use after suspected or confirmed exposure to Bacillus anthracis, also known as anthrax, but it must be administered together with other antibacterial drugs.\nThe drug is administered by intramuscular injection as a series of two doses, two weeks apart. BioThrax required three doses over four weeks.\nNass told\n[The Defender](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/) that if someone has a serious anthrax exposure, they typically [die within several days](https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/pages/Anthrax.aspx) unless treated with antibiotics.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be sprayed with anthrax and then get vaccinated and then patiently wait a month to develop immunity. You\u2019d be dead by then,\u201d she wrote.\nNass said FDA\u2019s requirement that the vaccine be given jointly with antibiotics is a tacit admission by the agency that the vaccine \u201cdoesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nNass told The Defender there are too few anthrax cases worldwide to study its efficacy in people. She cautioned that animal models have limits in predicting human immune responses, so the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness remains uncertain.\nIn this case, the insert reports that in\n[logistic regression analysis](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/what-is-logistic-regression/) of testing done in rabbits, the treatment demonstrated a \u201c70% probability of survival\u201d eight weeks after the full dose was administered. That \u201cdoes not sound promising,\u201d Nass said.\nFour clinical studies evaluated Cyfendus\u2019 safety. But according to the insert, three of the studies compared different doses of Cyfendus (studies\n[1](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01263691), [2](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04067011), and [3](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04067011https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04067011)) and one ( [study 4](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03877926?tab=results)) compared Cyfendus and BioThrax.\nObservational studies of BioThrax show the vaccine causes birth defects when administered to pregnant women.\nAccording to the insert, \u201cOf the 11 pregnancies (one twin pregnancy), 1 (9.1%) resulted in miscarriage and there were 2 infants (18.2 %) born with major birth defects.\u201d\nThe vaccine also caused other major side effects. 65% of subjects had limited use of their arm after the shot. 84% of subjects had a systemic reaction, and 8% refused a second shot.\nAccording to the insert, none of the six reported deaths or serious adverse events that happened in the clinical trial \u201cwere determined to be related to the administration of Cyfendus.\u201d\nIn the approval letter, the FDA told Emergent it did not refer the application to the FDA\u2019s\n[Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee](https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/blood-vaccines-and-other-biologics/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee), which typically evaluates data concerning the safety, effectiveness, and appropriate use of vaccines, because FDA\u2019s review of the application, \u201cdid not raise concerns or controversial issues that would have benefited from an advisory committee discussion.\u201d\nBut\n[Brian Hooker, Ph.D., P.E.](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/brian-hooker-ph-d-p-e/), chief scientific officer for Children\u2019s Health Defense, told The Defender he found the approval of the drug very concerning.\nHe said:\n\u201cThe anthrax vaccine used in the military has been a horrible failure with links to GWI and other neurological sequelae. It will be interesting to see where this goes with ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]. My fear is that they\u2019ll recommend it broadly for adults [after anthrax exposure], which would be a huge mistake.\u201d\nTies to military\nEmergent was founded in 1998 as BioPort, a private for-profit government contractor to distribute and produce the anthrax vaccine for the U.S. military, taking over the assets of the state-owned\n[Michigan Biologic Products Institute](https://www.mackinac.org/3966).\nIt purchased the existing stockpile of anthrax vaccine and the vaccine production plant when the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) made the vaccine compulsory as part of the\n[ Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program](https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/resources/anthrax-vaccine-research.html) (AVIP) for all 2.5 million military service members \u2014 including active duty and reserve personnel and civilian contractors.\nThe DOD has been administering the vaccine to service members since the 1970s.\nAfter the\n[ 2001 anthrax scare](https://www.history.com/news/anthrax-attacks-terrorism-letters), the company restarted production of the anthrax vaccine.\nThe company works with HHS, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to develop \u201ccountermeasures,\u201d such as vaccines and therapeutics, for \u201cpublic health threats.\u201d\nPrimary purchasers for its anthrax vaccine are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which buys it for the\n[Strategic National Stockpile](https://aspr.hhs.gov/SNS/Pages/default.aspx), and BARDA. Those contracts alone have yielded at least $1 billion for the company.\nIts other products include its\n[Narcan](https://www.narcan.com/) brand of naloxone, an opioid antagonist that can reverse opioid overdoses.\nEmergent also briefly produced the\n[COVID-19](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/) vaccine for Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, but its plant was shut down in 2021 when it was revealed the [ company hid likely contamination](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/10/us/politics/emergent-fda-vaccine-covid-contaminated.html) problems at the plant from FDA inspectors.\nIt eventually had to destroy 400 million vaccine doses \u2014 which led its share price to fall from $133 to $7. The company has been traded publicly since 2006.\nEmergent\u2019s stock price, which crashed to $7 per share after its COVID-19 vaccine production debacle, rose 30% after it announced FDA approval of Cyfendus last week.", "language": null, "image": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/anthrax-vaccine-toxic-side-effects-feature.jpg", "pagetype": "article", "links":
