There are several nuances of \nfungibility depending on usage.\nFungible T okens\nThis is the Larousse definition of \u2018fungible\u2019:\n\u201cRefers to things that are consumed by usage and can be replaced by \nthings of the same kind, the same quality and the same quantity\u201d\nIt is important to remember two points in this definition:\n\u2022 Things that can be replaced by other things of the same kind. For \nexample, two one Euro coins dating from 2015.\n\u2022 And usage. This is the most important but also the most complex \nconcept.\nIn the blockchain ecosystem, $SAND tokens are fungible. They will \nalways have the same value if they are exchanged with each other. They \ncan be spent to purchase $LANDs which are nonfungible.\nNon-Fungible T okens\nA Non-Fungible Token is NOT fungible. It is a token that represents a \nunique asset with characteristics that are particular to it: it cannot be \ninterchanged or replaced by another equivalent token.\nNFTs can take the form of a digital work, a virtual land, a domain name \nor even weapons  in a video game.\nNFTs are simply a technological medium that allows any digital item \nto be stored and circulated virtually on a blockchain. To some extent \n\u2018NFTs\u2019 can be compared with computer files in the sense that their type \nand usage can be extremely varied.\nSemi-Fungible T okens\nSemi-Fungible Tokens, on the other hand, will have a completely \ndifferent use. Intended to be a widespread consumer product, this token \nmust, nevertheless, retain an identity all of its own.\nThe most popular example to illustrate Semi-Fungible Tokens is \nthat of cinema or concert tickets. Here, for example, each token has \ninformation connected to the date, time and type of event. In the case \nof semifungible assets, it is not the asset but the series that presents \nunique characteristics.What are NFTs?9 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nNonFungible.com collects blockchain data via dedicated \u2018Blockchain \nNodes\u2019, owned by NonFungible.com, without using any intermediary \nor third party.\nList of data sources taken into consideration in this report:\nIt should be noted that NonFungible.com tracks 100% of the ERC-\n721 token activity on Ethereum, but only activity that has qualified \nas coming from genuine transfers was taken into account.

This number \ncorresponds more or less to the domain name of the Brand carried by \ntheir Ape.25 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nDistribution of the market \nby project\nThe market is very largely dominated by the two projects launched \nby Yuga Labs: OtherSide and Bored Ape Yacht Club, which alone \nrepresent more than $2 billion dollars traded in the second quarter.\nThe historic CryptoPunks (now owned by Yuga Labs) pales in \ncomparison with just $161 million traded over the period.\nThe 4 projects of Yuga Labs weigh for more than $2.5 billion on the \nwhole industry. In other words, Yuga Labs represents just over 30% \nof the entire NFT market during the 2nd quarter of 2022.\nWe are witnessing a hyper-centralization of activity in these Bear \nMarket times where BlueChips retain most of their value, and where \ntrading is focused on this asset class.Fig. 03 \u2013 Market share per project \u2013 Q2 2022\n26 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nPrimary and secondary markets\nFig. 04 \u2013 Volume of sales and dollars traded. Primary and secondary market (Q2 2022)\nThe secondary market tends to shrink, dropping from 90% to just under \n80% between the first and second quarters of 2022.\nSimilarly, the secondary market, which represented 70% of trades in the \nfirst quarter, has now returned to equilibrium and represents only 48% \nof all sales in the second quarter.\nThis is the first time that we have seen such a development between the \ntwo markets from one quarter to the next. Our interpretation is that the \nliquidity of most collections has decreased considerably, thus lowering \nthe rate of resale on the secondary market. The primary market has \nremained relatively stable in comparison, which brings this balance \nbetween the two markets.\nOn the other hand, the re-concentration of the market around \nBlueChips (see previous page) allows the secondary market \nto retain a significant share in terms of the volume of dollars traded.Number of salesTotal sales  USD\nPrimary Market Secondary Market\n$1 728 413 014 $6 421 347 797\n5 267 002 5038 14427 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nFig. 05 \u2013 Breakdown of the volume of dollars traded between the primary and secondary markets (Q1 & Q2 2022)\nFig. 06 \u2013 Breakdown of sales volume between the primary and secondary markets (Q1 & Q2 2022)Primary market Secondary market\nPrimary market Secondary market\n28 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nAlthough the market manages to maintain between $200 and $300 million traded each week, \nwe notice that the primary market has considerably decreased and now represents only a tiny \npart of the weekly volume.\nIt seems pretty clear that given the context, buyers of NFTs are no longer willing to take great \nrisks when buying their assets in the primary market.\nSales volume, although declining, remains relatively high, peaking at over 600,000 sales in the \nprimary market in early June. In general, the weekly volume of sales on the primary market has \nvery rarely been below 200,000 sales per week, which suggests that projects are still issuing \nassets regularly but for way lower prices.29 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nAverage NFT  price evolution \nThe decline in the value of cryptocurrencies, and more specifically ETH, has \nhad a direct (and unsurprising) impact on the average price of NFTs.\nBetween the end of April and the end of June, Ether experienced a price drop \nof around 66%, which was reflected in a drop of almost 75% in value for NFTs.\nThis phenomenon can be explained by the speculation observed in the \nCollectibles segment and by the need of a large number of traders to find \nliquidity in a more than unstable market.Average NFT price (USD) ETH price (USD)\nFig. 07 \u2013 Average price of an NFT vs. Average price of Ether\n-65.8%\n-73.6%30 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nSellers Buyers Wallets\nFig. 08 \u2013 Unique buyers, sellers and active wallets between Q1 and Q2 2022 (weekly basis)Active wallets\nGoing from almost 450,000 active wallets per week to less than \n200,000, the active community was reduced by 57% between January \nand June.\nThe number of weekly sellers seems to be stabilizing around 100,000 \nfor 132,000 buyers. At the lowest, there is therefore a rate of 1.32 \nbuyers for 1 seller.\nFor comparison, this rate was around 1.60 buyers for 1 seller at the \nbeginning of the year.\nDespite the significant drop in activity, it will be noted that the number of \nbuyers is still higher than that of sellers.\n  \n31 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nSupply & liquidity\nThe overall volume continues to increase, but at a particularly slower \npace in the Art, Collectibles and Gaming segments.

There are still about 8.5 million \nCollectibles in circulation to date.\nAt the same time, we note that the Metaverse segment has experienced \na fairly significant increase in its supply with nearly 25% increase, due to \nthe launch of OtherDeed for OtherSide and its 100,000 plots.\nFinally, Utilities saw the numbers soar with an increase of more than \n40% between the beginning and the end of the quarter.Fig. 09 \u2013 Total volume of assets identified by segment and evolution of supply by quarter.01/01/2022 01/04/2022 01/07/2022\nArt 1,751,218 1,889,387 2,002,389\nCollectibles 6,909,533 8,195,275 8,583,806\nGaming 21,602,192 22,635,899 22,742,730\nMetaverses 503,730 538,644 658,101\nUtilities 1,440,044 1,700,636 2,410,804Q1 2022 Q2 2022\n7.89% 5.98%\n18.61% 4.74%\n4.79% 0.47%\n6.93% 22.18%\n18.10% 41.76%Total supply per segmentPercentage of increase over the \nquarterAny question?

Good question, I am \nfirst and foremost an entrepreneur. \nI like to create things without really \nknowing how to monetize them, but I \nlike to create them. I began a startup \n12 years ago called Food Reporter, \nthen I created Bemyapp (also known \nas hackathon.com). It developed well, \nwe had around a hundred customers \nsuch as Facebook, Intel, HP and \nothers and we organized events in \nmore than 50 countries.\nI discovered crypto and blockchain \na few years ago. We organized some \nevents around blockchain but I wasn\u2019t \ntoo into it, I bought Ether back then \nbut didn\u2019t really believe in it. And then \nI discovered NFT s two years ago, and \nI took a slap! I bought a plot of land \nin Sandbox to organize events in the \nmetaverse because I thought it was \nfunny... and then I dug in and fell in love with the NFT \u201cart\u201d movement. I was \nlucky enough to witness the birth of a \nmovement and I started collecting like \ncrazy.\nWith my colleague Remi, we created \na live show on Clubhouse to invite \nartists and entrepreneurs on a daily \nbasis a week or two before the Hype \nBeeple. Basically, it was to explain the \nNFT s to Remi and it became a daily... \nand we did about 250 podcasts. \nIn parallel we wrote a book and \nother things, always with the aim of \ndemocratizing NFTs.\nT o come back to the question, I would \nsay that my goal is to federate. We \norganized meetups, small events and \nwe embarked on the NFT Factory, \nalways with the objective of bringing \nmore and more people into the NFT s \nand that the people who are in it can \nsee each other.John Karp,\nThe Non Fungible Conference Organizer\nJohn Karp\nThe Non Fungible Conference \nOrganizer, NFT Factory Co-Founder\nJohn Karp is a key figure on the French \nNFT scene and increasingly on the \nEuropean NFT scene. \nFor those who don\u2019t know him yet, \nJohn is the man behind the daily NFT \nMorning podcast, the \u201cNon Fungible \nConference\u201d in Lisbon, and more \nrecently he\u2019s been making waves \nagain by co-founding the NFT Factory: \nplace of innovation, meeting and \nconferences, the NFT Factory presents \nitself as the European Hub of the NFT \nindustry.\nWe meet with the man who is the \nstandard bearer for and important part \nof the NFT industry in Europe!`35 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nNonFungible.com: How did you come \nup with the idea for the Non Fungible \nConference?\nJohn: It\u2019s really the fusion of my two \npassions: NFT s on the one hand and \nevents on the other. I was in NFT s and \nI participated in a lot of events around \nthe world but I think I needed to make \nmy interpretation of this world, to share \nmy vision of NFT s. Because there were \nmostly Bitcoin or DeFi events... which \nis cool, but it\u2019s not the same audience, \nthe same passion.  When I said I was in \nthe NFT s, I was told \u201coh yeah it\u2019s good \nit\u2019s booming\u201d. And for me I thought \nthere was a problem. There are many \nevents where I have noticed that most \nof the speakers have never minted any \nNFT s. That\u2019s how I wanted to make a \nEuropean event for people who know \nN F Ts .\nThis is perhaps a somewhat radical \npositioning because I did not want to \ndiscover NFT s but to go to the level \nabove. With a clear spirit to put art and \nartists at the heart of the processes. \nIn 2021 we saw a lot of evolution, the \nbig brands have put themselves on it, \nthere are metaverses in all directions...\nbut before the \u201cindustry\u201d side, it\u2019s really \nabout putting artists at the center.\nThere are awesome metaverse \nprojects, awesome PFP projects but \nfor this event, it was putting art at the \ncenter of attention. Last October, I set \nup a small team to be able to set up the \nNon Fungible Conference in Lisbon a \nfew months later.NonFungible.com: What is the biggest \nbarrier for the mass adoption of NFTs?\nJohn: Honestly? There is no barrier \nanymore. We could talk about a \ntechnical barrier perhaps, but the \nmain barrier today is psychological. T o \nanswer this problem of psychological \nbarriers today and have mass adoption, \nit is that the common man hears about \nit once, twice, four times ... and is \ninterested in it. Everyone, when they \nhear about NFT s today, thinks \u201cit\u2019s still \nweird to buy JPEGs\u201d. Everyone went \nthrough this phase.\nDepending on your mentality, your \naversion to innovation or the trend \nof the world it will take more or less \ntime for you to take an interest in it. \nSo for me the only barrier is a time \nbarrier.  The only question is the faster \nwe communicate and communicate \nstrongly, the closer we get to this \nsnowball that will allow adoption.\nNonFungible.com: How do you see NFTs in \nthe next 5 years?\nJohn: In 5 years I think we will use \nthe title \u201cNFT\u201d more. In 5 years, in the \nsame way as the internet which is \neverywhere, NFT s will be everywhere. \nT oday we use a smartphone, we use \na TV, a computer, a whole series of \nthings that depend on the internet \nwithout asking ourselves the question \nof whether the internet is there or \nnot. T o take an older example, it\u2019s like \nelectricity.\nFor me we are at that point. These are \nunderlying technologies that make it \npossible to do a lot of things. You\u2019re \ngoing to play video games, you won\u2019t \nrealize you\u2019re activating, using or \nearning NFT s. You\u2019re going to buy skins \nlike that kind of thing you won\u2019t realize. \nYou\u2019re going to buy goods like works 36 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nof art... and during the transaction \nyou will not realize that you are using \nan NFT when buying. I don\u2019t know if \nit will be in 5, 7 or 10 years but we are \nmoving towards a society where we \nwill talk more about NFT but it will be \njust everywhere.\nNonFungible.com: Let\u2019s go back to the \nNFT Factory, what are its objectives?\nJohn: The NFT Factory is anchored \nin this evangelization process. When I \nwrote the book NFT Revolution, it was \nso that my father could appropriate \nNFT s. The NFT Factory follows this \nsame logic. From the outside you see \nan art gallery and then behind this \nvery accessible and very simple to \nunderstand thing there is all this NFT \nmovement. The goal is that you can \ncome in and go with your first with a \nlittle training, a little onboarding, and \nan understanding of what an NFT is. \nThe goal is really to have a team of \nabout fifty people to have a maximum \nof referent of this universe.\nThe starting point is that we do \nnot realize how far ahead France \nand even Europe is on this subject. \nSandbox is one of the world \nleaders in the metaverse. Sorare in \nentertainment, Ledger in security, \nother companies that are not yet \nknown, artists who are already known \nworldwide such as Pascal Boyart, \nObvious, Allota Money... In the DeFi \nthere are monsters that are French \ntoo.If you project yourself in 5 years \nprecisely, this kind of box will succeed \nGAFA. If you look at the history of \nGAFA, these boxes have cheesy HP \nand IBM who were the leaders in \ncomputing. And in my opinion, there \nare new leaders who will surpass the \nold leaders. It\u2019s boxes, if you want \nthem to work, the whole continent \nmust wake up. Maybe it goes through \npoliticians, maybe through journalists, \nbut it goes mainly through people.\nIf tomorrow in France there are 40M \nwallets, which buy and exchange \nNFT s and well behind there is a \nmarket that journalists and politicians \nwill follow. The goal is to start at the \ngrassroots and take people from the \nbottom up to the NFT s. The more \ncollectors, consumers, sensitized \npeople, the more you will accelerate \nthe snowball effect and welcome \npeople into the ecosystem.\nSo the objectives in the NFT Factory \nin summary are:\n\u2022  Evangelization\n\u2022  Formation\n\u2022  Event for the community and \nlarge groups37 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nWhat is PlayDapp?\nPlayDapp is a dApp service platform that provides C2C Marketplace and Tournament.

If the trend settles over the next few weeks and months, it\u2019s a safe bet \nthat NFT trading will no longer be a profitable activity at all in the 3rd quarter \nof 2022.\nThe peak at the end of April is explained by the Presale of OtherSide for \nOtherDeed which somehow slowed down the inevitable inversion of the \ncurves. At the lowest, we recorded up to $142 million in weekly losses for the \nweek of June 13, 2022.Fig. 11 \u2013 Weekly evolution of the volume of profit and loss when reselling NFTs\n40 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nProfit and loss per segment over time\nIf we look in detail at the activity by segment, we notice that the \nCollectibles segment has been the most affected by the phenomenon of \nlosses on resale.\nCollectibles are historically the most speculative assets in the industry, \nso it is not surprising to see very high rates of resales at a loss in a bear \nmarket environment.\nMost of the other segments, although also affected by the current \ncontext, seem to be stabilizing with just under $10 million in weekly \nlosses.\nThe segment that recorded the least loss at the end of the quarter was \nUtilities, with approximately $800,000 per week.Fig. 12 \u2013 Weekly evolution of profit volume by segment when reselling NFTsCollectibles Art Gaming Metaverse Utilities\n04.2022 05.2022 06.202241 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nThe most profitable projects\n7 of the 10 most profitable projects are Collectibles projects, for 1 \nMetaverse and 2 Utilities.\nIt should be noted that the Super Star project \u201cBored Ape Yacht Club\u201d \nis only ranked 3rd in terms of total profit recorded, despite a particularly \nhigh average profit at almost $50,000 per resale.\nThe largest proportional profit is recorded with the Ethereum Name \nService collection, with almost $98% profit on resale.

Insofar as the primary motivation for the \npurchase is a short-term profit when reselling, this explains why owners do not \nencumber themselves with their assets over time.\nOn the other hand, this resale rate at a loss also indicates that the players who \nhave \u201cinvested\u201d in these NFTs are in a form of feverishness which leads them \nto resell even in unfavourable market conditions. We can therefore think that \nthis NFT Bear Market tends to discourage amateur traders who thought they \nwould become millionaires in a few days.Focus per Segment7\n45 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nBreakdown of activity by segment\nNumber of sales\nGaming  33%  (-22%)\nCollectibles  33%  (-4%)\nArt  5%  (+2%)\nUtilities   25%  (+21%)\n \nMetaverses  4%  (+3%)\nVolume of USD traded\nGaming  6%  (-2%)\nCollectibles  60%  (-16%)\nArt  7%  (-1%)\nUtilities   7%  (+4%)\n \nMetaverses  20%  (+15%)\nActive wallets\nGaming  29%  (- 22%)\nCollectibles  35%  (+3%)\nArt  9%  (+3%)\nUtilities   20%  (+11%)\n \nMetaverses  7%  (+5%)Any question?

Art, \nMetaverses and Utilities share the remaining third.\nFrom a profit & loss point of view, there are more resales at a loss than \nresales at a profit in the Art segment for the first time (around $5M loss \nrecorded over the quarter). The Collectibles segment which experienced \nthe largest drop (-16%) remains globally profitable with still $265M in \nprofit, but given the trend over the last few weeks, it is a safe bet that this \nrate will increase and reverse over the next quarter.\nFinally, in most segments, the average holding period has tended to \nlengthen considerably (it has almost doubled for Collectibles and Gaming). \nMetaverses and Utilities, the two \u201cperforming\u201d segments of the quarter \nsaw their average holding period drop and remain below 30 days.8Overall Conclusions8\n53 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents\nOverall Conclusions\nThe very least we can say is that the \nmarket has changed pretty dramatically \nover just one quarter! \nWithout doubt for some, the NFT industry \nhas failed their expectations. One year \nsince the industry boomed many promises \nseem either delayed or non-existent, \nthe world has not relocated to the \nmetaverse, our IDs are not NFTs and not \nall NFT owners became millionaires, the \ndisappointment is real..\nWithout doubt the hopes and dreams a \nbooming industry created has impacted \nmany, newcomers especially and this \nnew downward turn has been a reminder \nto everyone of the volatility of the crypto \nspace as a whole.\nNevertheless, as with other crypto bear \nmarkets in the past, when the speculation \nfades the building phase intensifies \nleading into the next bull run of the future. \nBull runs may bring much profit but it is in \nthe bear markets where the real value is \nbuilt.\nThe NFT industry we see today grew \nand formulated over the famous Crypto \nWinter 2018 - 2019. This is when Bitcoin \ndropped from $20,000 to under $4,000 \nand Ether fell back below the symbolic \n$100 mark, but it was also during this time that thousands of people participated \nin building the world of NFTs we see \ntoday.  \nThis incredibly complex ecosystem we \ncall the NFT industry may not currently \nbe in the spotlight as it was during last \nyear\u2019s bull run hype but during this market \ndownturn builders in every project and \ncommunity are quietly moving forwards \nin full force, even stronger than ever, \nushering in the next era of Non Fungible \nTokens.\nSorry but NFTs are not dead, on the \ncontrary we\u2019re only just getting started!\u00ab Ultimately hard work will pay off more \nthan short term speculation.
