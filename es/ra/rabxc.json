Transactions between euro area residents are excluded.\nThe balance of payments consists of:\nthe current account (including the accounts for goods and services trade as well as the primary and secondary income accounts)\n- the capital account\nthe financial account (comprising direct investment, portfolio investment, financial derivatives, other investment and reserve assets)\nThe different accounts within the balance of payments are distinguished according to the nature of the economic resources (e.g. goods, services, income or financial resources) provided and received.\nThe balance of payments is based on a double-entry accounting system. Each transaction is recorded as consisting of two entries \u2013 a credit entry and a debit entry. The sum of the credit entries and the sum of the debit entries are the same.\nInternational investment position\nThe international investment position shows the value of residents\u2019 financial assets and liabilities vis-\u00e0-vis non-residents, including the same breakdowns as for the financial account, on a quarterly basis. The euro area international investment position shows the outstanding amount and composition of:\n- euro area residents\u2019 financial claims on non-residents\n- euro area residents\u2019 financial liabilities to non-residents\nThe difference between the assets and liabilities is the net international investment position and represents either a net claim on, or a net liability to, non-euro area residents.\nThe international accounts offer a full reconciliation of the changes of the international investment position into transactions, revaluations (price and exchange rate changes) and other volume changes.\nDashboard\nPress releases\n[BoP and i.i.p. statistical press releases](/press/pr/stats/bop/html/index.en.html) [Release calendar for BoP. and i.i.p. statistics](/press/calendars/statscal/ext/html/stprbp.en.html)\nData\nSources and methods\nThe concepts and definitions used for the balance of payments and international investment position are in line with the following international statistical standards:\n[European Union Balance of Payments and International Investment Position statistical sources and methods - \u201cB.o.p. and i.i.p. book\u201d, November 2016](/pub/pdf/other/eubopintiinvposstmeth201611.en.pdf) [IMF\u2019s Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6)](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2007/bopman6.htm)\nAdditional methodological information\n[The exchange of balance of payments and international investment position statistics \u2013 BPM6 - \"Booklet\", April 2023](/pub/pdf/other/ecb.bopips202304~696e0ec50b.en.pdf) [Euro area balance of payments and international investment position compilation: balancing mechanisms, October 2020](/pub/pdf/other/bop_iipc_201029.en.pdf) [Geographical allocation of euro area portfolio investment liabilities: estimates of outstanding amounts and associated income flows, April 2019](/pub/pdf/other/Geographical_allocation_of_euro_area_portfolio_investment_income_debits-methodological_note-201904~617d8ce92c.en.pdf) [Estimation of euro currency in circulation outside the euro area, April 2017](/pub/pdf/other/estimating_eur_in_circulation_outside_the_euro_area-201704.en.pdf) [Estimation of euro area balance of payments and international investment positions: extending the BPM6 series, April 2017](/pub/pdf/other/estimation_of_euro_area_bop_and_iip-extending_bpm6_series-201704.en.pdf)\nQuality reports\nThe Quality Report on euro area and national balance of payments and international investment position statistics is published every two years.
