Con estas pruebas, se puede determinar si los s\u00edntomas que tiene provienen de una alergia. Los s\u00edntomas de la alergia pueden incluir los siguientes:\nEn algunas personas con asma, las alergias a veces no afectan la nariz ni los ojos. Pero son un desencadenante de los s\u00edntomas de asma. En algunos casos, puede darse cuenta de a qu\u00e9 le tiene alergia. Por ejemplo, quiz\u00e1 tenga s\u00edntomas solo en primavera o en oto\u00f1o. Sin embargo, quiz\u00e1 deba hacerse pruebas de alergia para conocer otras alergias que pueda tener.\nEl proveedor de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica har\u00e1 pruebas para verificar su reacci\u00f3n ante al\u00e9rgenos. Entre ellos, se incluyen los siguientes:\nEn ocasiones, las pruebas de alergias se hacen con un an\u00e1lisis de sangre (IgE o inmunoglobulina E). O puede realizarse una prueba de provocaci\u00f3n. En esta prueba, el al\u00e9rgeno se inhala o se ingiere por v\u00eda oral. Pero lo m\u00e1s frecuente es que se hagan pruebas cut\u00e1neas. Hay dos tipos de pruebas cut\u00e1neas para alergias. Una es la prueba cut\u00e1nea de punci\u00f3n. El proveedor le pincha la piel con una aguja que tiene una peque\u00f1a cantidad de al\u00e9rgeno. Si es al\u00e9rgico, la zona se enrojece, se hincha y pica. En la otra prueba, se inyecta una cantidad peque\u00f1a de al\u00e9rgeno debajo de la piel.\nSi cree que las alergias desencadenan episodios de asma, hable con su proveedor de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica para hacerse las pruebas. Es \u00fatil saber a qu\u00e9 le tiene alergia. De ese modo, puede evitar el contacto con los al\u00e9rgenos. El proveedor de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica puede sugerirle que se coloque vacunas antial\u00e9rgicas (inmunoterapia). Las vacunas pueden reducir los s\u00edntomas.\n\u00a9 2000-2023 The StayWell Company, LLC. All rights reserved. This information is not intended as a substitute for professional medical care.
