See what they look like, learn how and when to use them, and receive tips on growing and harvesting them whether you live in an apartment or other small space, a conventional suburban yard or acres in the country.\nThe Weed Identification Walks have been taking place at GrassRoots Garden over seven years. These hands-on walks cover anywhere from 10-20 common weeds, characteristics for identification, seasonal changes (life cycles), growth habit, wildlife habitat, nutrients (soil/edibility) and toxic and edible weeds.\nCamera\u2019s and notebooks are encouraged to help retain some of the information that is learned. Active participation is also encouraged from the audience - as this is how learning works.\nIt isn\u2019t easy to ID plants on your own. Flipping through books or researching on the internet can bring on hours of frustration when trying to properly identify a plant, let alone a common garden weed. This walk is created with the home gardener in mind. By participating in the class, people learn about common weeds, similar to the ones growing in their own yards. Through the experience of the hands-on walk and a confident instructor to ID and teach about the weeds, the class empowers people to learn and understand what they have growing in their own yards.\nThe walk is a partnership between GrassRoots Garden, an important source of fresh fruit and vegetables for Food for Lane County operations to feed hungry people in Lane County since 1991, and the Oregon State University Extension, Lane County Master Gardener Program which provides science-based educational programs and information to the public.\nParticipants are welcome to eat lunch in the garden after the weed walk. The vegan meal prepared by the garden chef provides an opportunity to taste the herbs used in preparing the meal.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": "Event", "links": ["#main-content",
