However, in some cases, vaccines protect people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and dying.\nVaccine side effects\nYou might experience side effects after your vaccine, which is a normal sign that your body is building up its protection. The most common symptoms are:\nA sore or swollen arm\nTiredness\nHeadache\nFever\nChills\nThe risk of not getting vaccinated\nHigher amount of non-vaccinated people infected with an airborne virus\nHigher:\nHigher amount of non-vaccinated people infected with an airborne virus\nA workforce with a large population of non-vaccinated can pose a risk to the communities in which they work and increase:\nLack of productivity\nUnvaccinated employees must quarantine for 14 days after an exposure, while vaccinated employees face no such quarantine requirement.\nLong-term illnesses\nThose who get COVID-19 without being vaccinated could have long-term disabilities from long COVID-19. Some might need workplace accommodations, while others might not be able to return to the workforce.\nAbsenteeism\nEmployees, customers and clients might be more wary about coming to a workplace with lower rates of employee vaccination.\nLet\u2019s talk about COVID-19 testing\nTesting immediately when presenting COVID-19-like symptoms helps confirm if you have it and reduces the chances of putting the health and safety of those around you at risk.\nTypes of COVID-19 tests\nPCR-based tests:\nThese tests are performed in a laboratory and are the most reliable test for people with or without symptoms. These tests detect viral genetic material, which may stay in your body for up to 90 days after you test positive.\nPCR-based tests:\nThese tests generate results in 15-30 minutes. Remember that positive self-test results are highly reliable but that a single antigen test negative result does not rule out infection, especially if you have symptoms.\nRemember\u2026\nIf you test positive, the CDC encourages individuals to report the result to their healthcare provider and any recent or close contacts so that they can keep themselves and those around them safe.\nIf you are in a high-risk setting or around vulnerable populations, consistent testing as part of a screening program can help protect those around you from unintentional infection.\nFollow quarantine guidelines as mandated by your employer or state health department guidelines.\nVaccination and testing tools\nGeneral Business\n- All\n- General Business Employers\n- General Business Employees\nHealthcare\n-
