Bone metastasis is the dissemination of cancer cells from the primary tumor to the bone. Cancer cells cause a cycle in patients' immune response, beginning with antigens' release by cancer cells. These antigens activate dendritic cells, specialized in presenting antigens to T lymphocytes, which will move to the tumor and kill cancer cells, releasing new antigens. This cycle is inhibited by various factors in the tumor environment, so new therapies such as immunotherapies are being sought to enhance the immune response against cancer cells. In this project, we use autologous vaccines as immunotherapy, which have been used successfully for their antitumor effects. The aim was to characterize autologous the efficiency of vaccines against breast cancer cells and their bone metastasis, for which we made nine vaccine preparations from the 4T1 cell line. Parental 4T1 cells were prepared, transfected to express GM-CSF, which activates dendritic cells and tumor-derived 4T1 cells. All three cell types were lysed or fixed with paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde. We evaluated the preparations' ability to activate dendritic cells in vitro by flow cytometry and RT-qPCR and selected paraformaldehyde-fixed cell preparations. In an orthotopic breast cancer model, we immunized Balb/C mice for three weeks before inoculating them with 4T1 cells. However, none of the three vaccines affected the tumors' growth other than the mice that received a placebo. This lack of effect could be due to the low immunogenicity of breast cancer cells or the tumor microenvironment inhibiting the immune response. For this reason, it is necessary to improve the formulation of vaccines or combine vaccination with other therapies before testing their efficiency for the treatment of bone metastasis.\n[Tesis - Ciencias de la Vida](/jspui/handle/1007/25)\nCargar archivos:\n|Fichero||Descripci\u00f3n||Tama\u00f1o||Formato|", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#content", "/jspui/", "/jspui/", "#", "/jspui/community-list", "/jspui/browse?type=dateissued", "/jspui/browse?type=author", "/jspui/browse?type=title", "/jspui/browse?type=subject", "/jspui/browse?type=subject", "/jspui/help/index.html", "/jspui/contacto/contacto.jsp", "/jspui/politicas/politicasPrivacidad.jsp", "#", "/jspui?locale=en", "/jspui?locale=es", "#", "/jspui/", "/jspui/handle/1007/1", "/jspui/handle/1007/2", "/jspui/handle/1007/25", "http://www.cicese.edu.mx/", "/jspui/mydspace", "/jspui/subscribe", "/jspui/profile", "/jspui/browse?type=author&value=SARAI+VERONICA+MARTINEZ+BADILLO", "/jspui/handle/1007/25", "/jspui/bitstream/1007/3545/1/Tesis_Sarai%20Veronica%20Martinez%20Badillo_05%20marzo%202021.pdf", "/jspui/bitstream/1007/3545/1/Tesis_Sarai%20Veronica%20Martinez%20Badillo_05%20marzo%202021.pdf", "/jspui/handle/1007/3545/statistics"]}
