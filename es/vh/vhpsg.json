If consumption \ntrends remain unchanged, tobacco will kill more than \neight million people each year by 20301. In many parts    \nof the world, there is a trend for both women and men  \nto start  smoking  tobacco  at youn ger and younger  ages,  implying an urgent need to establish preventive actions \ntargeting vulnerable populations.  \n \nCancer is a health problem for humanity due to the high \nincidence and mortality rates that occur worldwide, and \nthe family, work and economic problems that it genera - \ntes2. The main known cause of bladder cancer is tobacco, \nwhich is attributed to about 50%  of all diagnosed cases.  Introduction  Abstract  \nResumen  Tobacco does not only affect our airway through smoke. \nMore than 60 carcinogenic products contained in ciga- \nrettes are absorbed and eliminated by the urine, greatly \naffecting the cells of the wall of our uri nary tract. Bladder \ncancer is a pathology whose incidence has been  increasing \nin recent  decades.  It is the second  most  frequent  neoplasm \namong genitourinary tumours after prostate  cancer3. \nMore than 60 carcinogenic products contained in ciga- \nrettes are absorbed and eliminated by the urine, greatly \naffecting the cells of the wall of our urinary tract4. Bladder \ncancer is the fourth most common cancer in men, but is \nless common in women5. By 2020, the American Cancer \nSociety estimates for this ca ncer in the United States  are \n- About 81,400 new cases of bladder cancer, of which \n62,100  will be men  and 19,300  will be women  \n- About 17,980 people will die from bladder cancer (about \n13,050 men and 4,930  women)6. \nIn 2015, more than 21,000 cases of bladder cancer were \ndiagnosed in Spain (17,439 in men and 3,564 in women), \nwhich  places  this tumour  in fifth  place  in terms  of incidence \nin Spain, according to data published by the Spanish Socie - \nty of Medical Oncology (SEOM)4. Bladder tumours accou - \nnt for 10% of tumours in men. They predominantly affect \nmen (4:1 ratio with women)5,6. Bladder cancer is the fifth \nmost common cancer among men in developed countries, \nwith approximately 357,000 new cases per year worldwide \n(274,00 0 men and 83,000 women). It represents 3.3% of \nall tumours (4.7% in men and 1.6% in  women)7. \n \nThe sex ratio is 3.3 men to every woman in the world, 3.8 \nin Europe, and 7 in Spain 7, where some 12,200 cases are \ndiagnosed annually, representing 11% of male tumours \n(10,700 cases) and 2.4% of female tumours (1,500 ca- \nses). In women, both incidence and mortality are low and \nrelatively stable. The incidence in Spain is among the hig- \nhest in the world, being the fourth most frequent tumor \nin men, after lung, pr ostate and colorectal tumors (adjus - \nted global rate in 2002: 33 new cases/100,000 inhabi - \ntants/year). Only in Egypt are more cases recorded, with  a \ntendency to increase  slowly7. \nProstate cancer in Cuba, as in many countries in the \nworld, is one of the main health problems. In 2002 this \ndisease represented 16.9% of all malignant tumours in \nmen,  except  for skin cancer,  surpassed  only  by lung  cancer \nand with a rate adjusted to the world population of 25.8 \nper 100 000 inhabitants. The a bsolute number of new \ncases per year has increased from 1 711 in 1992 to 2 087 \nin 2002; with respect to mortality, the number increased \nfrom 1560 in 1993 to 2 167 in 2004. In Villa Clara, can- \ncer is the leading cause of death; prostate cancer is the \nsecon d most prevalent site (crude rate: 41.9%) preceded \nby lung  cancer8. \nAlmost all of them are associated with the habit of smo - \nking as a major risk factor, since this addiction has ex - perienced a notable rise in Cuba, currently the country \nwith the highest  number of smokers in the region and \nranked 38th globally8. Between 2012 and 2017, 266 new \ncases have been diagnosed, 80% of which are male and \n20% female. From 2014 onwards, 33 cases of superficial \nbladder tumours and 51 invasive cases have been diag - \nnosed8. 80% of the clinical trials carried out are aimed at \ncancer therapy, as this is the second cause of death in the \nterritory. Almost all are associated with smoking as the \nmost important risk factor, since this addiction has expe - \nrienced a notable rise in Cuba, currently the country with \nthe highest number of smokers in the region and ranked \n38th globally9. \nBladder cancer is the sixth leading cause of death in Cu- \nban men and the tenth in women10. It is considered a \n\u201csilent disease\u201d, because while the ce lls are transformed \nand increase, up to 10 years can pass without symptoms. \nThe true cause of prostatic carcinoma is unknown, but it \nis clear that its growth is influenced by sex hormones. It  \nis common for the symptoms of prostatic carcinoma to \nappear in the late phase of its development and are usua - \nlly due to local obstructive infiltration, distant metastases \nand chronic stasis -induced urinary  infection11. \nThese high numbers of patients show  that mortality from \nthis disease is the leading cause of death between the \nages of 50 and 64 and the second most common among \nthe age groups 5 -49 and 65 and older, and has the \ngreatest impact on life expectancy at birth for Cubans. \nEach year, more than 27 ,000 new cases are diagnosed \nand more than 18,000 deaths are recorded. From 1990  \nto 2005, cancer mortality in Cuba has increased by 2%  \nper year. Death itself cannot be avoided, however, it can \nbe postponed. The importance of this fact for health has \nmoti vated the development of measures since long ago. \nThe rise in mortality due to malignant tumours could be  \na more serious problem in the future in Cuba, given the \nageing process of the Cuban population. This ageing pro- \ncess will imply a greater demand for  human, material and \nfinancial resources for the treatment of this disease, as \nwell as for the implementation of preventive  actions12. \nIn the urology service, this pathology is highly frequent in \nrecent years. There are statistics at the national level on \nthe morbidity and mortality of this disease, thanks to re - \nports of cancer when the diagnosis is confirmed, but  there \nare no studies that characterize the clinical epidemiologi - \ncal behavior and therapeutic diagnosis of bladder tumors \nin the Cuban populati on with this disease, especially in \nour service; there are only studies related to the behavior \nto be followed in these patients as well as the use of BCG \nas intravesical  therapy.  \nSince  ancient  times,  symptoms  related  to bladder  tumours \nhave  been  directly  and indirectly  mentioned  and this disea - \nse has been referred to as the fleshing of the  bladder13,14. \nFifty  percent  of all bladder  tumors  are directly  attributed  to \nsmoking.  However,  the exact  mechanism  of carcinogenesis  102 www.revhipertension.com  \n \nin smokers remains unknown. More than 60 carcinogens \nare present in tobacco, of which 4 -amino -biphenyll, acro - \nlein and oxygen free radicals induce urothelial tumours. \nArylamines, which include amino -biphenyls, appear to be \nthe main carcinogens in cigarette -induced bladder cancer. \nSmoking is also associated with alterations in p53 gene \nexpression. Genetic polymorph isms in DNA repair and in \nphase I and II enzymes may potentiate urothelial damage.  \nThis work provides information on the behaviour of this \npathology in the urology service, as well as providing gui - \ndance on how to work on the basis of earl y diagnosis and \ntherapy of this pathology. Thus improving health services, \nquality and life expectancy of patients.  \n \n \n \n \n \nor the diagnosis  of bladder  tumors,  anamnesis \nis important, the symptoms and clinical signs \nfound,  as well  as the hemochemical,  imaging  \nand histological diagnostic means confirm this  nosological \nentity. A retrospective descriptive cross -sectional  observa - \ntional study was performed at the Urology Service of the \nCelestino Hern\u00e1ndez Hospital, in the municipality of San- \nta Clara,  Villa  Clara Province,  in the period  2014 -2019.  \nThe inclusion  criteria  are determined  based  on the existen - \nce of hospitalized  patients  diagnosed  with  papillary  transi - Revista Latinoamericana de Hipertensi\u00f3n.

The average age at diagnosis was 73, and \nmen  were  about  three  to four  times  more  likely  to develop \nbladder cancer in their lifetime than women. Bladder can- \ncer was diagnosed almost twice  as often in whites compa - \nred to blacks, and the presence of metastases to the lung \nand regional lymph nodes were the most affected  sites.  \nSimilar results were found in previous studies where in \nCuba, the locations of stomach, colon -rectum, bile ducts \nand bladder in men showed a significant decreasing trend \nbetween 1990 and 2005. On the other hand, in a longi - \ntudinal study, mortality rates from bladder cancer in men \nwere more than twice as high as in women. Since this is \npart of the group of tobacco -depen dent neoplasms, its \nincidence and mortality should be affected by the preva - \nlence of the habit and by changes in it over time15. \nThe differences found in both genders can be attributed \nto the fact that women are less exposed to risk factors \nthan  men,  and that  their  exposure  (their  increased  tobacco \nuse and exposure to high -risk working conditions) is more \nrecent.18. An example is Spain, where dark tobacco is re- \ncognized as having a greater impact on bladder  cancer19. \nTobacco use can be considered an indep endent factor in \nthe recurrence  or progression  of superficial  tumors.

In \naddition , cigarette smoking is the single most important \ncause of bladder cancer and smokers have a two to four \ntimes higher risk of developing this neoplasm than the \ngeneral  population22,23. \n \n \n1.
