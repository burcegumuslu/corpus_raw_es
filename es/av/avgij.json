The National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH), National Center for Complementary and Alternative\nMedicine (NCCAM) conducts and supports basic and applied research and\ntraining and disseminates information on complementary and alternative\nmedicine to practitioners and the public. Organized under the Director\nof the NIH, the NCCAM does not serve as a referral agency for various\nalternative medical treatments or individual practitioners. The NCCAM\nfacilitates and conducts biomedical research.The NIH cautions users not\nto seek the therapies described on these pages without the consultation\nof a licensed health care provider. Inclusion of a treatment or resource\non the NCCAM Web site does not imply endorsement by the NCCAM, the NIH,\nor the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).\n|\n||\n|\n[The\nNCCAM Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Citation Index](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nccam/camonpubmed.html)\n(CCI) consists of more than 180,000 bibliographic citations from 1966\nto 1998. Citations were extracted from the National Library of Medicines\nMedline database.

The Alternative Medicine \"Homepage is a jumpstation for sources\nof information on unconventional, unorthodox, unproven, or alternative,\ncomplementary, innovative, integrative therapies. In 1996, The National\nLibrary of Medicine and the MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) Term Working\nGroup, Office of Alternative Medicine, National Institutes of Health classifies\nalternative medicine as an unrelated group of non-orthodox therapeutic\npractices, often with explanatory systems that do not follow conventional\nbiomedical explanations.The National Library of Medicine's previous classification\nwas non-orthodox therapeutic systems which have no satisfactory scientific\nexplanation for their effectiveness. Others define it as medical interventions\nnot taught at United States medical schools or not available at United\nStates hospitals. Alternative therapies include, but are not limited to\nthe following disciplines: folk medicine, herbal medicine, diet fads,\nhomeopathy, faith healing, new age healing, chiropractic, acupuncture,\nnaturopathy, massage, and music therapy\".\n|\n||\n|", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["http://www.acupuncturecare.com/acupunct.htm", "http://www.healthy.net/asp/templates/article.asp?PageType=article&ID=1820", "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/cbm/acupuncture.html", "http://www.amfoundation.org/herbinfo.htm", "http://medherb.com/ETHNOBOT.HTM", "http://www.fitoterapia.net", "http://www.homeopathy.com/", "http://www.holisticmed.com/www/homeopathy.html", "http://lyghtforce.com/HomeopathyOnline/", "http://www.homeopathy.org/", "http://www.homeopathy.ca/", "http://www.nesh.com/main/nejh.html", "http://www.homeopathic.com/intro/his.htm", "http://www.homeopathyhome.com/reference/articles/ukhomhistory.shtml", "http://www.cmhidalgo.com/users/aflores/historia.html", "http://www.wholehealthnow.com/homeopathy_info/history.html", "http://www.geocities.com/homeosin/articulos/historia.html", "http://www.medspain.com/n6_sept99/homeopatia.htm", "http://bvs.sld.cu/revistas/mgi/vol15_5_99/mgi17599.htm", "http://www.medicina-naturista.net/", "http://www.quiropractica-aeq.com/aeq/index1.trx?idioma=1?Ar=OpcsPri", "http://www.nccam.nih.gov/", "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nccam/camonpubmed.html", "http://www.pitt.edu/~cbw/altm.html", "../index.html"]}
