It is unisex and suitable for all skin types. We use mint essential oil* as a fragrance that will give you a truly Mediterranean freshness!\nAs we age, our skin changes. Fine lines and wrinkles appear and our skin becomes less elastic. To help keep our skin looking its best, we need to adjust our skin care routine using safe anti-aging skin care products.\nAdding face mask as part of your skin care routine can work wonders. It\u2019s good for deep cleansing. With constant use of deep cleansing face mask, you\u2019ll see a glowing shine and a fresher appearance, at a faster pace. It also help absorb your other skin care products into the skin faster and more deeply.\n*organic origin ingredients\n100 ml | Glass container | Dermatologically tested |\n[Non-comedogenic](https://health.howstuffworks.com/skin-care/cleansing/products/non-comedogenic-skin-cleansers1.htm) | Not tested on animals | No parabens | No sulphates\nMEDITERRANEAN INGREDIENTS FOR A CLEAN AND PURIFIED FACE\nAfter months of research and betting on innovation, we have selected the best natural ingredients from our Mediterranean land to exfoliate, clean and moisturize the skin of your face.
