When we get vaccinated, we aren\u2019t just protecting ourselves, but also those around us, including our loved ones. Millions of people in the country have received the COVID-19 vaccine, and we know that it is safe and effective. To date, the vaccines are up to 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 with no serious safety concerns noted in the clinical trials. Like all drugs, vaccine safety continues to be monitored after they are in use.\nSide effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are a normal sign that your body is building protection. Side effects will vary from person to person with the most common being pain and swelling around the injection site, fever, chills, tiredness, and headache. You should call your doctor if:\n- The redness or tenderness where you got the shot increases after 24 hours\n- Your side effects are worrying and don\u2019t go away after a few days\nSeek immediate medical attention by calling 911 if you believe you are having a severe allergic reaction after being given the vaccine.\nFor general information about the COVID-19 vaccine, please visit the\n[CDC\u2019s vaccine web page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html)\n.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["/", "#",
