The interaction of th e airway mucosa with the allergens may be essential for the \ntriggering of the subsequent immune response. In  the present work, we developed a murine model \nof allergic disease based on primary airway expo sure to antigen followed  by continuous airway \nchallenge. Following sensitization and after on ly three intranasal challenges, a classical \nintraperitoneal model developed airway hyperrespo nsiveness to MCh, increased airway contractile \ntissue mass, eosinophilic inflammation and mucous hypersecretion in the upper and lower airways. We detected in this model a high number of Foxp3  mRNA\n+ cells in the lung inflammatory \ninfiltrates. Conversely, murine models based on pr imary airway allergen exposure and continuing \nchallenge showed attenuated asthma features, in cluding borderline airway hyperresponsiveness, a \nmodest increase in airway contractile tissue mass and mucous production, and an attenuation of the \neosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates with a drift towards a lymphocytic profile. In such models \nbased on primary airway exposure, mucous overproduction was found as an early response prior to \nthe development of any adaptive immune response, which suggests the participation of and innate \nimmune response prior to the onset of chronic airway inflammation. Subepithelial collagen \ndeposition behaved differently from the airway cont ractile tissue mass, and increased progressively \nover time. Contrary to the intraperitoneal model, moderate numbers of Foxp3  mRNA-expressing \ncells were found in the pulmonary inflammatory infiltrates upon primary airway antigen exposure. \nHowever, such Foxp3  mRNA+ cells increased over time proportionally to the duration of the \nallergen instillations, and their numbers were proportionally balanced with Il10 and Tgfb mRNA \nexpression. These findings suggest a role of Tregs in the attenuation of the asthma features in the \nprimary airway exposure models, whereas most Foxp3+ cells in the intraperitoneal sensitization \nmodel may have been non-functional. In all, these results suggest that classic animal models of \nexperimental asthma based on intraperitoneal sens itization represent the eff ector arm of the adaptive \nimmune response, but fail to reflect the regulatory arm, which is likely operated by Treg \nsubpopulations. The data are also consistent with the hypothesis that primary contact of the antigen \nwith the respiratory mucosa is crucial to determine the profile of the subsequent immune response in \nterms of attack versus tolerance, and that the in nate immune system plays a central role in such \ndecisions.  \nTo demonstrate that FOXP3-expressing T cells may drive immune regulation in an \nexperimental asthma setting, versus the induction of asthma features by effector CD4+ T cells, we \nperformed two series of adoptive transfer experiments employing genetically modified T cells, by Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 14means of retroviral gene transduction. Adoptive tr ansfer of 100,000 antigen -specific, effector, GFP-\nexpressing, CD4+ T cells was sufficient, upon antigen airw ay exposure, to elicit migration of GFP+ \ncells to the airways and induce airway hyperres ponsiveness and inflammation. On the contrary, \nantigen-specific Treg cells generated by forced FOXP3 expression, of which 75,000 were \nadoptively transferred to recipients with establis hed experimental asthma, led to an attenuation of \nasthma features.  \nFinally, to find translational evidence on a role of Treg cells in human asthma, we studied the \npresence of FOXP3+ cells in bronchial biopsies from severe asthmatics versus control subjects. \nFOXP3+ cells were virtually absent in the control subjects, whereas the specimens from asthmatics \nrevealed a significant influx of FOXP3+ lymphocytic cells in subepithelial location. Further work is \nwarranted to better define the phenotype and Treg function of such FOXP3+ cells. \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n ABBREVIATIONS \n \n 17 AD: anno domini (in the year of our Lord) \nADAM: A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain \nANOVA: analysis of variance aTreg: adaptive T regulatory cell \nBAL: bronchoalveolar lavage \nBALT: bronchial associated lymphoid tissue BDP: beclomethasone dipropionate \nBC: before Christ \nBCR: B cell receptor bFGF: basic fibroblast growth factor \nBreg: B regulatory lymphocyte \ncDNA: complementary deoxyribonucleic acid to mRNA \nCS: calf serum \nCT: cytotoxic CTLA-4: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 \nDAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (fluorescent stain) \nDN: double negative DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid \nDP: double positive \nEMTU: epithelial-mesenchymal thropic unit FBS: foetal bovine serum \nFC: flow cytometry \nFEV\n1: forced expiratory volume in the first second of forced expiration \nFISH: fluorescent in situ  hybridization \nFOT: forced oscillation technique \nFOXP3 /Foxp3 : forkhead box P3 protein / gene \nFRC: functional residual capacity \nGALT: gut associated lymphoid tissue \nG-CSF: granulocyte-colony stimulating factor GFP: green fluorescent protein \nGINA: Global Initiative for Asthma \nGITR: glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein \nH-E: haematoxylin eosin \nHDM: house dust mite HGF: hepatocyte growth factor \nHRP: horseradish peroxidase \nIFNG: interferon gamma i.e.: id est \nIg: immunoglobulin \nIL: interleukin IL7R: interleukin 7 receptor \ni.n.: intranasal \ni.p.: intraperitoneal/intraperitoneally IRES: internal ribosome entry site \nIRF4: interferon regulatory factor 4 \niTreg: induced T regulatory cell i.v.: intravenous/intravenously \nLABA: long-acting beta-agonist \nLB: Luria Bertani (culture medium for prokaryotes) Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 18LBA: Luria Bertani medium with ampiciclin \nMCh: Acetyl- \u03b2-methylcholine chloride \nMCS: multicloning site MHC: major hystocompatibility complex \nMLCK: myosin light chain kinase \nMLI: mean linear intercept MOI: multiplicity of infection \nmRNA: messenger ribonucleic acid \nNFKB: nuclear factor kappa-light-cha in-enhancer of activated B cells \nNK: natural killer \nNKT: natural killer T cell \nNMWL: nominal molecular weight limit \nnTreg: natural T regulatory cell \nOVA: ovalbumin PAMP: pathogen-associated molecular patterns \nPAS: periodic acid Schiff \nP\nBM: perimeter of the basal membrane \nPBS: phosphate buffer saline \nPCR: polymerase chain reaction \nPE: phycoerythrin PEEP: positive end expiratory pressure \nPBS: phosphate buffer saline \nPCR: polymerase chain reaction PDGF: platelet-derived endothelial growth factor \npMDI: pressurized metered-dose inhaler \nPSG: Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine RAG: recombination activating gene \nRNA: ribonucleic acid \nR\naw: airway resistance \nRL: lung resistance \nRti: tissue resistance \nRT: room temperature \nSABA: short-acting beta-agonist \nSCG: sodium cromoglycate SEM: standard error of the mean \nSMA: smooth muscle actin \nSTAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription \nTCR: T cell receptor \nTGFB: transforming growth factor beta \nTh1/2/3: type 1/2/3 helper T lymphocyte Tm: melting temperature \nTLC: total lung capacity \nTLR: Toll-like receptor TNFA: tumor necrosis factor alpha \nTNFR: tumor necrosis factor receptor \nTSDR: T regulatory specific demethylated region Tr1: type 1 regulatory T cells \nVEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor \n ABBREVIATIONS \n \n 19  \n \nNote about gene/protein nomenclat ure following consensus guidelines1 \n \nGuidelines for the human species \n- Full gene names are not italicized, Greek symbols are never used and hyphens are almost never \nused (eg: transforming growth factor beta). \n- Gene symbols are italicized with all letters are in upper case and no hyphens.

ASTHMA \n1.1. General aspects \nAsthma is a complex disease characterized ma inly by airway inflammation (1). The word \n\u201casthma\u201d comes from the Greek verb aazein , meaning to pant, to exhale with the open mouth. We \nhave evidence in Egyptian hierogl yphics that asthma preceded the Gr eeks. Indeed, the first attempt \nto clinically describe asthma is documented in a Chinese medical book, approximately in the year \n2600 BC (2, 3). However, the earliest text where th e word asthma was coined as a medical term is \nThe Corpus Hippocraticum , by Hippocrates (460-360 BC), wher e asthma was associated with \nspasms that more likely occurred among anglers, tailors, and metalworkers. Aretaeus of Cappadocia \nand Galen of Pergamo corroborated Hippocrates\u2019 texts in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD respectively, \nand described asthma as bronchial obstruction. This  first perspective of asthmatic disease remained \nalmost intact until past the Middle Age. During this period, a hospital facility was built in Damascus \nin 706 by Al-walid, the Ummayad Caliph. This hospital may be considered the most ancient \nprecedent of modern hospitals.  \nIn the 17th century, Jean Baptiste Van Helmont (157 9 \u2013 1644), a Belgian physician, chemist and \nphysiologist who suffered from asthma, said that asthma originated in the \u201cpipes\u201d of the lungs and \npointed out that the contraction of the lungs is a pathophysiological mechanism of asthma (2). Later \nin the same century, Bernardino Ramazzini (1633 \u2013 1714) detected a link between asthma and \norganic dust and also recognized exercise-induced asthma. By the same time, English physician Sir \nJohn Floyer, who developed asthma following a resp iratory infection, provid ed detailed accounts of \nsigns and symptoms of asthma and described a hereditary component. In 1684 Thomas Willis \nproposed that asthma was caused by defaults in the nerves and nervous fibers pertaining to the \nbreathing parts. From this we can conclude that as thma was first depicted as a disease rather than a \nsymptom by Thomas Willis and John Floyer in the 17th century. \nThe asthma concept was refined in the later part of the 19th century with the publication of a \ntreatise by Henry Hyde Salter, where he wrote a detailed description of asthma symptoms, helped \nby suffering asthma himself (4). At that time, allergic diseases like asthma or hay fever were \nconsidered as an \u201caristocratic dis ease\u201d due to asthma being more prev alent in England in aristocratic \npeople than in farm workers. This was later in terpreted as a sign of superiority in the British \npopulation by the British physician Morell Macken zie (1837 \u2013 1892). Also, the French writer \nMarcel Proust (1871 \u2013 1922) described in detail his asthmatic disease in letters to his mother, where \nhe wrote about symptoms and feelings he felt during his asthma attacks.  Asthma \n 24Advances in Medicine at the beginning of the 20th century were to a great extent contributed by \nSir William Osler, who described asthma as a condition producing spasms of bronchial muscles, \nswelling of the bronchial mucous membrane and a special form of inflammation of the smaller \nbronchioles (5). Osler was first in connecting clini cal observation with physiology and pathology. In \n1903, Brodie and Dixon experimentally documented the physiological process of bronchial \nnarrowing from constriction of airway smooth muscle (6). In 1906, experimental exposure to \npurified allergens was found to reproduce the symptoms of hay fever (7), which led to the \ncharacterization of asthma as an allergic hypersensitivity to foreign antigens. In 1921 the discovery of a serum substance that could passively transfer \u201callergy\u201d to a specific allergen (8) led to the \nidentification of IgE (9) and provided a crucial link to  characterize asthma as an allergic disorder. In \nthe first part of 20\nth century, Paul Ehrlich described aniline stains for eosinophils (eosin) and mast \ncells (toluidine blue) (10, 11), which favoured the histopathological study of different diseases, \nmainly allergic diseases including asthma. These advances, together with technical advances in \noptical microscopy, led to a clearer understanding of how allergen exposure triggers the release of \nchemical mediators from airway mast  cells (early reaction), and this in turn leads to the recruitment \nof eosinophils, basophils and mononuclear cells (late reaction) (12, 13). The la te response in asthma \nwas also linked with enhanced airway reactivity to i rritant stimuli. In the 1970\u2019s and early 80\u2019s, the \nmast cell was attributed a central role in triggeri ng IgE-dependent inflammation in asthma (14), and \na wide range of pro-inflammatory products (histamine, prostaglandin D2, cysteinyl leukotrienes, \ntryptase, chymase, heparin\u2026) were identified as mast cell products participating in the asthmatic \nreaction. Also at that time, there was increasing interest in the role of T lymphocytes in allergic \nresponses (15), which led to the identification of a special subset of T ce lls capable of secreting \ncytokines (IL4, IL5, IL13) that selectively inter act with mast cells, basophils and eosinophils, and \nwere responsible for the recruitment, priming and survival of the primary effector cells of the \nallergic cascade (16).  \nIn addition to airway inflamma tion, structural changes occurr ing in asthmatic airways became \nan important hallmark of asthma in the early 1990\u2019 s. Such changes are esp ecially prominent as the \ndisease takes on a more severe and chronic phenotype  (17, 18) and are described in detail below. In \nthe early 2000\u2019s, the interplay between the bron chial epithelium and the subjacent mesenchymal \nelements, involved in processes such as lung development, repair and inflammation (local \nproduction of cytokines and growth factors), led to coin the term epithelial-mesenchymal trophic \nunit (EMTU). The EMTU was suggested to release grow th factors involved in the airway structural \nchanges of asthmatic subjects (19) . Also, recent genetics research has shown that particular gene INTRODUCTION \n \n 25 polymorphisms ( ADAM33 , DDP10 , SPINK5 , MUC8 \u2026) may determine or influence asthma or \natopy susceptibility (20-22). In the last decade, th ere have also been considerable advances in the \nknowledge of dendritic cell biology and function that  have highlighted the importance of these cells \nin asthmatic disease (23).  \nSignificant improvements in asthma care have been achieved from the early 90\u2019s upon the \nintroduction of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), which issued re ference guidelines for \nasthma management. GINA defines asthma as a \u201cchro nic inflammatory disorder of the airways in \nwhich many cells and cellular elements play a ro le. The chronic inflammation causes an associated \nincrease in airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent ep isodes of wheezing, \nbreathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. These \nepisodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction that is often \nreversible either spontaneously or with treatment\u201d (24).  \nThe main clinical asthma features ar e wheezing, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea, \nbronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness. Such features are variable in the asthmatic \nsubjects, with different clinical-epidemiological \u201cphenotypes\u201d being defined according to the \ndisease history, clinical manife stations, inflammatory profile an d response to therapy. Airflow \nobstruction is variable in asthma, and can be episodic (in association with triggers such as \ninfections, allergens, inflammatory bursts), or ra ther persistent (associated to airway structural \nchanges), leading in the latter case to an irreversible deterioration of lung function (25). Recently, \nthe understanding on asthma disease mechanisms evolved to consider that airway remodeling, \ndefined as structural alterations that develop in association with chronic inflammation, plays a \ncentral role in the clinical manifestations of th e disease and causes the clinical signs (26, 27). \nChronic airway inflammation may lead to airway remodeling, and the reversible episodes of airflow \nobstruction may evolve towards chronic obstruction and the aforementioned progressive, ireversible \ndeterioration of lung function. A variety of fact ors, from respiratory infections to pollution, \nallergens and meteorological conditions (humidity, cold, wind\u2026), may trigger acute asthma \nepisodes, and the overlay of as thma exacerbations may alsoinfl uence the progression towards a \nchronic decline in lung function (28). Although the basic and clinical knowledge on asthma has \nconsiderably evolved in the recent y ears, a greater complexity of the disease is also being perceived. \nThere is no current explanation fo r the increasing prevalence of asthma as per the data presented on \nthe next section. Furthermore, a relevant proportion of the asthmatics suffer from severe disease \nrefractory to maximum available therapy, and the disease mechanisms and their variability are far \nfrom being understood. Asthma \n 261.2. The asthma burden  \nAsthma affects approximately 300 million people worlwide, causing about 180,000 deaths each \nyear, and is estimated to account for 1 every 250 deaths (24, 29). Many of these deaths, otherwise \npreventable, are due to suboptim al long-term medical care and sl ow emergency response on life-\nthreatening asthma attacks in developing countries with poor health resources. From another \nstandpoint, industrialized countries have seen a sustained increase in asth ma prevalence since the \n60\u2019s, and have taken a lead in asthma research as a priority in the health systems of the European \nUnion and North America. It is un clear whether the increasing prevalen ce in these areas is currently \nslowing down or inverting (30). Nevertheless, the prevalence of asthma appears to increase with \nindustrialization and Occidental lifestyle (31), a nd this trend is paralleled by an also growing \nprevalence of autoimmune diseases and allergies. It is estimated that the overall asthma prevalence \nis increasing by 50% per decade in the world, and has doubled within a decade in the European \nUnion (29, 32). Another reason to establish asthma as a research priority is the fact that, despite \ncurrent treatments and their positive impact in the management of most asthmatics, about 10% of \nasthmatics still develop severe, refractory disease (33)  and, in a percentage of the latter, asthma may \nturn fatal (34). \nIn Spain, the prevalence of asthma ranges from 5.1 to 7.5% in the general population, (24, 32) \nand 9 to 13% in children aged 13-14 (35). Ac ute asthma attacks are a frequent cause of \nhospitalization, since approximately 20% of asthmatics have acute episodes requiring emergency \nroom visits (28, 36). Indeed, acute asthma is the most common cause of hospital admissions among \nchildren of all ages (37). Noteworthily, patients that suffer asthma exacerbations cost three times \nmore, in terms of health care resources, than th ose who do not exacerbat (36). Therefore, asthma \nexacerbations imply a great cost  for the health systems in all countries. Additionally, the \nproductivity losses caused by poor asthma control are estimated to account for \u20ac9.8 billion per year \nin Europe (29).  \n \n1.3. Asthma pathophysiology \n1.3.1.  Airway structure \nAnatomically, the intrathoracic airw ays start with the trachea, whic h bifurcates into the left and \nright main bronchi. From this point, the intrapulmonary airways continue to branch into successive \ngenerations of bronchi, then bronchioles (which lack supportive cartilage in their wall), terminal \nbronchioles and respiratory bronchioles (where the respiratory epithelium alte rnates with alveolar INTRODUCTION \n \n 27 openings). This tree-like structure of conducting airways ends into the lung parenchyma, which is \nthe area of gas exchange, made of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, sacs and alveoli. \nAt the histological level, the airways consist of several tissue layers that differ in composition \nfrom the trachea to small bronchioles. The function of this branching is to carry inspired air to the \nalveoli, and expired air to the outside. In this route, the air passes through three levels of conducting \nairways: trachea, bronchi and bronchioles. The in ner layer of the airway wall is the so-called \nrespiratory epithelium, a pseudo-stratified ciliated cylindrical epithelium, in which all cells are \nanchored to the basal membrane, bu t not all of them reach  the lumen. This epithelium is composed \nby several cellular types including: basal cells with a regenerative function; ciliated cylindrical cells, \nwhose cilia are joined by dynein arms, a prot ein that gives consistency and promotes cilia \nmovement; and goblet cells that contain mucus granules. Next layer, underlying the respiratory \nepithelium basal membrane, is the lamina propia , a layer of conjunctive tissu e rich in elastin fibers, \nwhich provides a space for the distribution of blood  and lymphatic vessels and nervous fibers. Both \nlayers, the respiratory eptithelium and the lamina propia , are called mucosa. Immediately beneath \nthe mucosa, and depending on the level of the ai rways, we can find a layer called submucosa. The \ntracheal submucosa is a layer of dense connective tissue containing mucous, serous or mixed glands \nthat secrete mucin and polipeptidic substances to airway lumen. Also in the trachea and beneath the \nsubmucosa, we find the tracheal cartilage, the trach eal muscle and the adventicia, a layer of loose \nconnective tissue and adipose cells  that surrounds the trachea. \nFrom the standpoint of neurophysiology, the lungs are mainly innervated by the sympathetic \nand parasympathetic systems, which determine the bronchial airway tone by sustaining a balance \nbetween bronchodilation and bronchoconstricition stimuli. Although the sympathetic system \ncomprises less direct innervation of the airways than the parasympathetic, the bronchial smooth \nmuscle cells express \u03b22-adrenergic receptors that can be stimul ated by circulati ng catacholamines to \nproduce smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilatation. By contrast, the parasympathetic system \ninnervates the airways directly , inducing bronchoconstriction through cholinergic stimuli.  \n1.3.2.  Pathophysiological changes in asthma: airway remodeling \nThe term \u201cairway remodeling\u201d in asthma can be defined as a process occurring in response to \nchronic airway inflammation that results in permanent structural abnormalities in the airway wall (27, 38). Airway remodeling is believed to provide a pathophysiological basis for airway \nhyperresponsiveness and airflow obstruction (39), and may start in an early phase of the disease \nprior to the onset of symptoms (Figure 1). The changes described as part of airway remodeling are: Asthma \n 28 \n\u0005 Thickening of the respiratory epithelium. The respiratory epithe lium is particularly \nthickened in asthmatic subjects. Epithelium desquamation has also been described in asthma (40), Figure 1. Airway histopatho logical changes in asthma.  (A) The normal airway wall. In the respiratory \nepithelium, ciliated cel ls are predominant, and goblet and basa l cells and goblet cells  intercalate. The \nlamina propria , rich in elastine fibers that give consistence to the airway structure, underlies the \nepithelium, followed by the airway smooth muscle layer and the adventitia. ( B) Asthmatic airway, goblet \ncell hyperplasia and hypertrophy, together with incr eased mucous and serous glands, lead to mucous \noverproduction. Excessive deposition of extracellular ma trix causes subepithelial fibrosis, and the airway \nsmooth muscle undergoes hyperplasia and hypertrophy. All such change s lead to an overall thickened \nairway wall and facilitate airway narrowing.  B A INTRODUCTION \n \n 29 although some consider this phenomenon as an artifact resulting from ti ssue processing (41). A \nrole for the airway epithelium in the pathogenesis of asthma has been proposed by studies \nhighlighting the presence of epithelial dysfunctio n and a breakdown of the epithelial tight junction \nintegrity (42-44). Evans et al. introduced the term EMTU, referring to the involvement of airway \nstructural cells in controlling the airway mi croenvironment during processes such as lung \ndevelopment, repair, and regulation of inflammatory responses (45). Airway epithelium \nabnormalities in asthma may lead to a deregulated interaction between the epithelium and \nsubjacent mesenchymal elements such as fibroblasts, altering EMTU function. Fibroblasts have the ability to differentiate into myofibroblasts that secrete extr acellular matrix proteins and pro-\ninflammatory mediators. Also, increased epithelium fragility and damage during chronic \ninflammation may led to epithelial cell activati on and the release of a wide range of pro-\ninflammatory mediators (cytokines, eotaxin, growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and \nmetalloproteases), which may contribute to chronic inflammation and airway remodeling (46). \nAnother reason for the thickening of the respiratory epithelium is globet cell hypertrophy and \nmucous hypersecretion.  \n\u0005 Increase in the size and number of mucous glands.  Mucous glands in asthma are present in \nperipheral bronchioles, where they are normally absent, and can make up a higher proportion of \nthe submucosa in fatal asthma compared with  normal subjects (47). These glands may have \ndilated secretory ducts and eventually leak ai r, causing interstitial emphysema in complicated \nasthma (48). An increased mucous viscosity can  significantly reduce mucociliary clearance (49), \nplugging the small airways and causing a poor response to inhaled bronchodilators (50). Mucous \noverproduction can also cause mucous plugs in airways of all sizes, from second generation \nairways to bronchioles (51), and lead to atelectases. As such, it has been reported that over 50% \nof the airways can be occluded by muc ous during a fatal asthma attack (52).  \n\u0005 Goblet cell hyperplasia. The increase in goblet cell number  is associated with mucous \nhypersecretion. Goblet cell hyperplasia and the c onsequent secretory hyper activity are attributed \nto inflammatory mediators such as IL9 (53) and IL13 (53-55). Mucous production by the \nincreased mucous glands also contribute s to excessive mucous in the airways.   \n\u0005 Subepithelial fibrosis. The basement membrane of the airway epithelium is formed by the \nbasal lamina (the \u201ctrue\u201d basement membrane as defined by electron microscopy) and the lamina \nreticularis  (a net of reticular fibrils, of type VII co llagen mainly, and  microfibrils of fibrilin), \nboth synthesized by conjunctive tissue cells. The thickening of the lamina reticularis , a feature of \nsubepithelial fibrosis in asth matic bronchi, is caused by ex cessive deposition of extracellular Asthma \n 30matrix and alterations in its turnover (56). Th e appearance of such thickening under regular \nbright-field microscopy led to the term \u201cthick ening of the basal membrane\u201d, an inaccurate \ninterpretation from early observations. The excessi ve deposit of extracellular matrix is actually \nlocated in the subepithelial region and is mainly constituted by type I and III collagen fibers, \nfibronectin and proteoglycans (26, 57, 58). Subepithelial fibrosis may result from airway \nepithelium dysfunction and loss of integrity, which may resul in an impaired repair response to \ninjury (44). It has been also speculated that subepithelial fibrosis may oppose airway smooth \nmuscle contraction and limit its e ffect on airway narrowing (59).  \n\u0005 Bronchial angiogenesis. A network of capillaries of the systemic circulation runs in the lamina \npropria  and plays a role in the inflammatory process. Also, there is angiogenesis leading to \nneovascularization with altered permeability, which may facilitate edema and contribute to airway \nnarrowing and airflow obstruction (52, 60). Several endothelial growth factors may be implicated \nin angiogenesis, such as the vascular endothelia l growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth \nfactor (bFGF), platelet-d erived endothelial cell growth fact or (PDGF) and hepatocyte growth \nfactor (HGF) (26).  \n\u0005 Increased airway smooth muscle mass.  The term airway smooth muscle mass refers to the \namount of airway smooth muscle, relative to airway size. Airway smooth muscle mass is \ncharacteristically increased in as thma, probably due to a combination of cellular hyperplasia and \nhypertrophy. Clinical and experimental data su ggest that the increased smooth muscle mass plays \na central role in the m echanism of airway hyperresponsiven ess, a cardinal asthma feature. \nFurthermore, the airway smooth muscle may play  a pro-inflammatory role through the secretion \nof several mediators (61).  \n \nThe increase in airway smooth muscle mass occu rs through a combination of mechanisms that \ninclude the action of mitogenic and pro-inflammatory  molecules, alterations of extracellular matrix \ncomponents, and direct actions of immune cells such as mast cells (62) and T cells (38, 63, 64), \nwhich will be described further on. The increased airway smooth muscle may play several roles in \nthe pathophysiology of the disease. Airway smooth muscle cells are able to secrete mediators that \ncan alter tissue homeostasis and thus modify the function of other cell types. In fact, airway smooth muscle cells in asthma may induce myofibroblast migration and recruitment to the lamina propria , \nwhich has been observed in asthmatic patients and may play a relevant role in the disease (57, 65). \nAlso, Ma et al.  observed in vitro  an increase in myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) activity in \nsmooth muscle cells obtained from pulmonary biopsies of asthmatic patients, compared with INTRODUCTION \n \n 31 healthy controls. Airway smooth muscle may therefor e have a greater contractile capacity in asthma \n(66). However, these results remain controversial, because Woodruff et al, in a similar study, found \nno difference in MLCK  expression levels between smooth muscle cells from asthmatics versus \ncontrols (67).  \nApart from the properties of the airway smooth muscle itself, other studies showed alterations \nin the airway cartilage and fibronectine volume and integrity in asthma, which may result in \nincreased bronchocostriction upon smooth muscle contraction (27, 57). \n1.3.3.  Response to airway provocation \nAirway hyperresponsiveness, (also termed  airway hyperreactiv ity or bronchial \nhyperresponsiveness or hyperreactivity) is a cardinal asthma feature, defined as exaggerated \nbronchoconstriction in response to a variety of nonspecific stimuli. Airway hyperresponsiveness is \nmost usually determined by measuring the forced expiratory volume in the first second of forced \nexpiration (FEV 1) in response to increasing concentrations of an inhaled, nebulized cholinergic \nagonist such as \u03b2-methacholine (MCh). MCh works as an acetylcholine analogue (68) inducing \ndirect constriction on airway smooth muscle cells. The test output is the MCh concentration that \ncauses a 20% or greater fall in FEV 1 (provocative concentration 20 or PC 20), and the test is \ngenerally considered positive if such value is <8 mg/mL. The test is aimed at reflecting the airway \nresponsiveness to nonspecific bronchoconstrictive stim uli such as cold air, ozone, infections, etc. \nThe MCh challenge test is very sensitive and has a high negative predictor value (69).  \nThe relation between airway hyperresponsiveness and asthma symptoms is variable. \nApproximately 50% of subjects with airway hype rresponsiveness are asymptomatic. Also, airway \nhyperresponsiveness can present subclinically  and may precede asthma symptoms. Airway \nhyperresponsiveness is considered a risk factor for the development of asthma in children (70). \nRecently, associations between ge netic polymorphisms and airway hyperresponsiveness have also \nbeen reported. A polymorphic alelle of the A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 33 \n(ADAM33 ) gene has been associated with the onset of childhood asthma and airway \nhyperresponsiveness, impaired lung  function in infancy and the acceler ated decline in lung function \nthat occurs in severe asthma (71). ADAM33  encodes a membrane-associated protein that can be \ncleaved into a soluble catalytic fragment, which is  a powerful angiogenesis factor involved in \nsmooth muscle development (72). \nThe airways can also be challenged with specific allergens. During allerg en exposure in atopic \nasthmatics, the inhaled allergen binds to IgE on th e surface of mast cells, leading to the immediate \nrelease of histamine, which causes an early bron choconstrictor response within 10 minutes and Asthma \n 32lasting approximatelly 90 minutes. IgE has been linked to allergic responses in humans for almost \n50 years (73, 74). Histamine acts on H 1 receptors of the airway smooth muscle, sharing signalling \npathways with M 3 muscarinic receptors. Both are G-protein- coupled receptors that, upon activation, \nallow the increase of intracellular Ca+2 concentration in the muscular cell, which in turn stimulates \nmyosin light chain kinase activation, inducing smooth muscle cell contration. This IgE-dependent \nbronchoconstriction, termed early  airway allergic reaction, can  be followed by a subsequent, \nsustained bronchoconstriction starting 3-8 hours later and lasting several hours or days. This latter \nresponse, termed late airway allergic reaction, involves CD4+ effector T cells and is mediated by a \ncomplex array of mediators including cytokines and leukotrienes (75). \n1.3.4.  Asthma treatment \nFrom ancient literature, it is inferred that asth ma existed priorly to the times of the Egyptian \nEmpire, 3000 years BC, although the disease has only been identified as an entity termed asthma \nsince the 17th century. The George Ebers Papyrus, found in Egypt in the 1870s, contains \nprescriptions written in hieroglyphics for more than 700 remedies, including asthma (a mixture of \nherbs heated on a brick so that the sufferer could inhale their fumes). In the 2nd century, Roman \nphysician Galen treated asthma symptoms with owl\u2019s blood in wine. In the Middle Age, Moses \nMaimonides (1135-1204 AD), a physician in the court of Sultan Saladin of Egypt and Syria, \ndiagnosed asthma in the Prince Al-Afdal. He related asthma episodes with wet months when the \ndisease would begin as a common cold. He also note d that the dry months of Egypt helped asthma \nsufferers and suggested avoidance of strong medication, plenty of sleep, fluids, moderation of \nsexual activity, and chicken soup. At the end of the 19th century, although seemingly \ncounterintuitive given the potential for exercise-induced brochospasm, exercise was proposed to \nimprove subjective and objective asthma indices (4); but the proposed regimens were unrealistic \n(76). One hundred years ago in China, it was common to give a person with asthma herbs \ncontaining ephedrine, which may have had a bronchodilator effect mediated through \u03b22-adrenergic \nreceptors. Also, earlier treatments of asthma included tobacco, Indian hemp, sedation (using \nchloroform, ether, or opium), coffee or tea among others. Some of such agents block cholinergic \nsignalling to some extent and favor the sympathetic tone and airway smooth muscle relaxation (77). \nThe first pharmacological aim for the treatment of asthma, before the relevance of chronic \nairway inflammation was understood, was to achieve  bronchodilation. After the first studies on the \nuse of nebulizers to produce a fine spray in the 1870\u2019s, James Burnett, an Edinburgh physician, \nreported in 1903 the benefits of inhaled adrenaline as a bronchodilator therapy for asthma (78). \nHowever, it was not until the 1950\u2019s when inhalation therapy was revolutionized with the invention INTRODUCTION \n \n 33 of the first pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) (79). By the early 1960s, the rapid response to \ninhaled aerosols of non-selective adrenergic agonists such as adrenaline and isoprenaline was \nextensively exploited with pMDIs, but the asso ciation between isoprenaline and an increase in \nasthma deaths defeated its usefulness (80, 81). Further development led to safer bronchodilators, \u03b22-\nadrenergic agonists, to be administered with pMDI inhaler devices. Salbutamol a short-acting \u03b22-\nadrenergic agonist (SABA), was marketed as a su bstitute for isoprenaline and is still widely used, \nnowadays as rescue medication, due to its quick an d more selective action on airway smooth muscle \nand minimal side effects (82). The use of salbutamol and the introduction of systemic steroids for \nthe management of life-threatening asthma made a large reduction of asthma deaths possible in the \nlate 1970s (79). \nThe isolation of cortisone by Tadeus Reichstein  in 1936, and its posterior identification by \nKendall and Hench (79), favoured its first applicatio n in asthma in 1950 (83), which in turn led to \nthe confirmation of its beneficial e ffects by clinical trials a few year s later (84). In subsequent years, \nprednisone and hydrocortisone were developed and introduced in the clinical practice. However, the \nassociation of long term systemic steroid therapy with serious advers e effects, such as hypertension, \nosteoporosis, diabetes and obesity, led to the need of researching on a safer administration of \nsteroids. Clinical trials in the 1970s stablished that the inhaled administration of beclomethasone \ndipropionate (BDP) or other steroids is an effective treatment to control asthma (85, 86). The studies \nreported that BDP reduces airway eosinophilic, mast cell and mononuclear cell inflammation and \ndecreases the late asthmatic reaction and airway hy perresponsiveness (87, 88). The characterization \nof asthma as an airway inflammatory disease and th e identification of the role of mast cells (12, 13) \nled to the finding that chromone mast cell-stabilising agents such as sodium chromoglycate (SCG) \nattenuate both the allergen-induced early and late  bronchoconstrictor responses (89). Although the \nefficacy of SCG resulted equal to or inferior to low-dose inhaled steroid therapy, chromones are \nnowadays used rarely (79).  \nInhaled corticosteroids revolutionized the management of asthma in the 1980s. In the late \n1980s, inhaled long-acting \u03b22-adrenergic agonists (LABAs), firs t salmeterol and then formoterol, \nwere introduced in the clinical practice (90-93).  LABAs have a bronchodilator action for up to \ntwelve hours, and appear to also have a side anti-inflammatory effect. Clinical trials (94, 95) \nreported benefits from adding LABAs to the ther apy of patients with poorly controlled asthma, \nwhich led to treatments combining LABAs with inha led steroids as a current standard therapy for \nmoderate persistent asthma and beyond (96, 97). Asthma \n 34The evidence that allergen exposure in specific settings was a key step in the pathophysiology \nof asthma, led in the 1990s to the idea of blocking the primary mast cells signaling cascade by \ndirecting a monoclonal antibody to the IgE site  that binds its high affinity receptor (Fc \u03b5R1) on the \nmast cell. This approach was successful in mouse m odels of allergy (98) and subsequently tried in \nhumans with omalizumab, an engineered, humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (99). The \nomalizumab has inaugurated a new are of therapeutics based on genetically engineered monoclonal \nantibodies to block specific mediators or their r eceptors, with a growing development pipeline and \nimportant hopes for severe asthma and other diseases. In the case of omalizumab, still the only \napproved therapy of this type for asthma, the treatme nt effectiveness is variable and concerns on its \ncost and potential side effects have been raised (100-107). \nPresently there is no cure for asthma. Asthma  treatment is currently intended to control \ninflammation, mainly by means of inhaled cor ticosteroids. However, there is no evidence of \nattenuation or reversal of airw ay remodeling through pharmacol ogical therapy. Recently a new \ntherapeutic approach has been introduced to ameliorate symptoms in patients with severe asthma, \nwhich is bronchial thermoplasty. This consists in delivering a radio frequency energy to the airways \nby flexible bronchoscopy with the aim of reducing airway smooth muscle mass and responsiveness \n(108-111). However, there is not enough evidence th at this technique ameliorates all asthma types \n(112) and its high complexity and cost make this a pproach not valid for routine treatment. In all, we \ncan conclude that current asthma treatment is suboptimum and not sufficient to control severe \nasthma (38). Also, the pathogenesis of asthma is far from well understood, which makes further \nbasic and clinical research necessary for the deve lopment of new therapeutic targets and treatments. \n \n1.4. Animal models of experimental asthma \nAnimal models have contributed significant knowledge to the pathogenic mechanisms of \nasthma and continue evolving to better delve into airway remodeling and the asthmatic \nimmunological response.  \nIt is probable that the first recording of bronchoconstriction in an animal model of allergic \ndisease was reported by Auer et al.  in 1910 using guinea pigs during anaphylactic shock (113). In \nthis work, guinea pigs were subcutaneously sensitized to horse serum and challenged intravenously \n(i.v.), which resulted in anaphylactic death caused by asphyxia. The cause of asphyxia was defined \nby the authors as \u201ca titanic contraction of the smooth muscles of the bronchioles; which occludes \ntheir lumen gradually, so that finally no air enters or leaves the lung [\u2026] the animal was INTRODUCTION \n \n 35 strangulated\u201d. Since this first animal model in which a bronchoconstriction was described, extensive \neffort has been done to achieve an an imal model that mimics human asthma.  \n1.4.1.  Different animal models of experimental asthma \nNo laboratory animal is known to spontaneously develop a disease resembling asthma. \nHowever, some outbread animal  species do naturally develop asthma-like diseases. Cats can \ndevelop a bronchial disease similar to human asthma, with lung inflammation and \nbronchoconstriction (114, 115). Current research work in cats is being conducted to elucidate \nmechanisms that may help discover new ther apeutic targets for human asthma (116). \nHorses can get sensitized to hay molds and develop an allergic airway obstructive disease, \ncalled \u201cheaves\u201d, with neutrophilic airway inflammation and airway smooth muscle remodeling \n(117). \nDogs has been used to model allergic disease due to their natural predisposition to develop \nallergic responses to antigens that are clinically significant to atopic humans (118), but this allergy \nnormally manifests as dermatitis or conjunctivitis rather that airway inflammation. However, several \nworks have developed dog models that achieve asthma hallmarks, such as increased IgE, airway \nhyperresponsiveness (119), lung eosinophilia and acute physiological constriction in response to \nallergen inhalation (120). These models may result useful to study physiological and clinical \nimplication of asthmatic disease. Some of such models have been achiev ed through selectively \nbreeding dogs with high IgE levels at baseline (119). The high IgE levels seem to correlate with the \npredisposition to develop allergic reactions by the dogs, which matches with human allergic disease.  \nSheep can develop natural allergic sensitization to Ascaris suum  (a parasitic nematode worm), \nwhich is accompanied by elevated IgE levels and ai rway hyperresponsiveness (121) (122). This fact \nhas made sheep a potential and attractive model for asthma, progressively developed to date (123). \nHowever, initial studies where drugs showed to be e ffective in moderating lung allergic responses in \nsheep (124, 125), did not translate to humans (126). This highlights the care that must be taken \nwhen comparing animal models with human disease. In the case of sheep, one also has to take into \naccount the high costs for housing and mani pulation that these large animals require. \n Guinea-pigs  have been used as animal models for pulmonary hypersensitivity for more than 80 \nyears (127). In these animals, the major bene fit is the lung as the target organ for the \nhypersensitivity response, which allows for intranas al (i.n.) sensitization against allergens and the \nsubsequent development of neutrophilic/eosinophilic pulmonary inflammation and airway \nhyperresponsiveness after i.n. challenge (128). Th ese animals are also rela tively inexpensive, easy \nto handle, and mimic physiological abnormalities of human asthmatics, developing a well-Asthma \n 36characterized early and late phase response to a llergen challenge following sensitization (129, 130). \nHowever, the existence of few inbred strains and species-specific reagents, together with a \ndiscrepancy in the response to leukotrienes with humans (131), must be taken into account when \nemploying the guinea pig for experimental purposes beyond the histological study of the lungs, and \nairway hyperresponsiveness (132). \nRats are widely used to develop animal mode ls for human diseases (133-140) as they are \nrelatively cheap, large in size, and stable under an aesthesia. In the respiratory field, the rat eases \nparticular measurements such as airway markers of inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Also, the rat can be easily sensitized to a broad range of antigens (133, 141-143) and \nsensitization and challenge typically result in a Th2 dominant response, characterized by \neosinophilia and antigen-specific IgE (144), although is dependent on the strain used (145). The rat \nrepresents a useful asthma model that has allowed us to better understand allergic airway diseases, \nbut the expansion of genetic techno logies, mainly applied to the mouse, have displaced the rat as a \n\u201csecond option\u201d for asthma models. However, the av ailability of rat-specific reagents has increased \nin recent years together with the advent of transgenic technology, which is balancing the usage of \nrats with mice. \n1.4.2.  Murine models of experimental asthma \nMurine models of experimental asthma have become widely used to study allergic airway \ndisease. Mice are broadly used to model most diseases because of the detailed understanding \nregarding their genetics (146), the ease to manipulate outcomes using transgenic technology (147), \nand the broad amount of commercially available mouse-specific probes and antibodies. In fact, \nactual therapeutic targets have been developed from studies in mice (148), which reflects the \nimportance of murine models to study human diseases. Thus, murine models are considered an \nimportant basic research tool to understand the mo lecular and cellular bases of asthma (149-151).  \nHowever, some differences must be taken in to account when working with disease animal \nmodels, and the mouse is not an exception. Differe nces in the tracheo-brochial tree between humans \nand mice must be considered (152), such us: the size,  where total lung capacity in humans is about 5 \nL and only 1 mL in the mouse; the alveoli of the murine lung are smaller (80 \u03bcm mean linear \nintercept (MLI)) than those of humans (MLI of 210 \u03bcm); the thickness of the blood-gas barrier is \nabout 0,38 \u03bcm in the mouse and 0,62 \u03bcm in humans; the murine lungs have fewer airway \ngenerations (13-17) than do human lungs (17-21 generations), and no respiratory bronchioles. Also, \nmice only have pulmonary circulation in the lungs, lacking bronchial systemic circulation. Despite \nall such differences, animal models have produced extensive knowledge applicable to human INTRODUCTION \n \n 37 disease and, in fact, provided the essential link between inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness \nand asthma more than 20 years ago (153). Experimentally induced asthma in mice shows an \nimmunological profile analogue to human asthma, with Th2 allergic response and eosinophils as \none of the main cellular components of the infla mmatory infiltrates in the lung (154, 155). Mice \nalso have other advantages compared with othe r animal models (rat, ho rse, sheep\u2026): they are \ncheap, small, and have a rapid biological cycle, with a gestational period of approximately 20 days, \na lactation period about 4 weeks, an d they reach sexual maturity at 5 weeks. Pros and cons in the \nusage of mice as models for human asthma have been widely reviewed (156-163). \nAn important issue to take into account in the development of mouse asthma models is the \nchoice of mouse strain, because the effects of a llergic sensitization and the experimental asthma \noutcomes vary significantly depending on the strain used (164). The most commonly used strain for \nasthma modeling is the Balb/c, because of its Th2-biased immune response.   \n1.4.3.  Allergen nature \nA wide diversity of allergens were used to sensitize animals in asthma models, from the most \ntraditionally used ovalbumin (OVA) to a number of actual human allergens such as house dust mite \n(HDM), cockroach antigens, Aspergillus fumigatus  and ragweed extracts. Early experiments in \nanimals on toxicity were performed more than 100 years ago on dogs, guinea-pigs, and rabbits, \nwhere violent or fatal reactions to repeated injections of foreign proteins were described (165). The \ntoxicity of serum xeno-infusion was attributed to  so-called \u201ctoxalbumins\u201d (166). Already in the 20th \ncentury, the first animal models of experimental asthma were described in guinea pig (1926) (167), \ndog (1970) (168) and even the monkey (1972) (169, 170). These models were based on sensitizing \nanimals to an allergen followed by subsequent challenges, which induced lung inflammation and \nairway disease. In 1960\u00b4s Mota reported the in duction of an anaphylactic reaction through the \ninduction of \u201cmast cells sensitizing antibody\u201d using sensitization to egg albumin plus Bordetella \npertussis  bacilli (171), and suggested a role for mast cells in airway allergic diseases. OVA is not an \nair-borne allergen causing human asthma, and immunological tolerance is normally developed \nthrough bowel exposure from the diet. This immunoregulatory mechanism is called \u201coral \ntolerance\u201d. In the case of laboratory rodents, the diet has an OVA-free controlled composition, \ntherefore leaving the antigen with the capacity to in duce allergic Th2 responses in these animals.  \nIn the 1970s, Church reported a rat model of \u201canaphylactic bronchoconstriciton\u201d and the \ninhibitory effects of dexamethasone, SCG, and other drugs (172). Church used a nematode \n(Nippostrongylus brasiliensis ) infection to sensitize rats and the challenge was done i.v. Two years \nlater, Stotland et al. immunized rats with OVA plus aluminium hydroxide gel as a coadjuvant with Asthma \n 38or without B. pertussis  vaccine, and reported \u201canaphylactic bronchoconstriciton\u201d 14 days after \nsensitization (173). At the same time, Chang et al.  established a mouse model of sensitization to \nragweed pollen, a real human air-borne allergen , achieving anaphylactic reaction to intravenous \nchallenges (174). In 1976, Gerbrandy et al.  studied the kinetics and localization of IgE production in \na F 1/J mouse model of allergic sensitization to tetanus toxoid and B. pertussis , where they compared \nseveral sensitization approaches (175). They reporte d that intratracheal and intraperitoneal (i.p.) \nsensitization result in higher IgE production than subcutaneous immunization. They showed that the \nsite for IgE production is the bronchial lymph node s in both cases and that the effect of i.p. \nsensitization is attributable to peritoneal draining into bronchial lymph nodes. This work \ndemonstrated lung involvement in the allergic response and the correlation with serum IgE levels. In \n1978, Carswell et al.  established an experimental asthma m odel that became \u201cclassical\u201d, in which \nLister rats were subcutaneously sensitized with OVA and aluminum or B. pertussis as coadjuvants, \nfollowed by aerosol airway challe nge (176). They reported an incr ease in serum IgE levels and its \nrelationship with the respiratory response. A year later, Piechuta et al.  varied Carswell\u2019s model with \ni.p. sensitization and also reproduced the correla tion of IgE levels with the respiratory response \n(177).  \nIn the 80s, approximately 10% of the U.K. po pulation suffered from allergies to HDM (178) \nand the association between HDM and asthma became  an intense focus of research. Dust mites are \norganisms classified inside an arachnid subclass ( Acari ) of less than 1mm in length. They feed on \norganic detritus such as flakes or human skin shedding and grow in the environment of dwellings. \nThe mite\u2019s gut contains potent digestive enzymes (m ainly proteases) that persist in their feces and \nbecome major allergens (179). HDM extracts contain a complex array of allergens (180), although \ntheir major mite component is Dermatophagoides spp  (D. pteronyssinus in Europe and D. farinae  in \nAmerica). The major allergen from D. pteronyssinus , especially for asthma, is a 25 kDa molecule \npresent in the mite faecal particle s. This allergen, called Der p 1 has been first isolated by Chapman \net al.  in 1980 (181) and molecularl y characterized by Simpson et al.  (182). In the following years, a \nwide range of allergens with similar patterns was described in HDM extracts and their relationship \nwith human atopic diseases was studied (183). Thes e advances awakened the interest in applying \nactual allergens to animal models of allergic diseases, including asthma, with the aim of reproducing the human disease as closely as possible.  This led in the early 90s to encompass clinical \nexperimental research with HDM in atopic people (184-186) with animal models (187, 188). Since \nthen, HDM has become an extensivel y used allergen to develop animal models of allergic airway \ndisease (189, 190). INTRODUCTION \n \n 39 Nowadays, the most used allergens are HDM  extract and OVA. HDM contains antigens \nimplicated in allergic rhinitis and asthma in humans, and its use in animal models is an advantage in \nthese terms (191-193). However, an inconvenien ce of this approach is that HDM is a complex \nmixture of antigens and it is difficult to standardize for experimental purposes. Taking all this \ntogether, the allergen choice must be in agreemen t with the aims of each study, taking into account \nthe advantages and limitations and se arching for a balance in each case. \n1.4.4.  Sensitization and challenge protocol \nSince the first murine asthma model over 40 years ago (172), a broad range of protocols have been \nused to induce experimental allergic disease in animal models. The majority of murine asthma \nmodels have been based on i.p. sensitization, ach ieved by injecting an antigen mixed with an \nadjuvant, either as a single dose or followed by a booster dose. Once sensitization is attained, \nsubsequent airway allergen challenges trigger an allergic cascade in the lungs, eliciting mast cell \ndegranulation, recruitment of inflammatory cells (especially eosinophils), activation of T and B \ncells, and the release of a myriad of mediators, which results in the manifestatios of allergic disease \nin the upper and lower airways. These models repr oduce the efferent/effector stage of the disease \nefficiently (airway inflammation and remodeling, airway hyperresponsiveness), but do not represent \nthe afferent phase, i.e. allergic sensitization, in the way it occurs in human disease. The division \nbetween the sensitization and challenge phases is artificial in these models, and sensitization is \ninduced by a parenteral antigen \"vacci ne\" administered with an adjuvant. \nProbably, the first experiment of primary airway exposure leading to IgE production was performed \nby van Hout et al.  (194), who used aerosolized OVA to challenge rats, which led to IgE synthesis. \nIn the 80s, Holt et al . highlighted the \u201cneed of models which more closely approximate the \ntriggering of IgE responses under natural conditions, i.e. wherein the antigenic stimulus is not \naccompanied by adjuvant, and the po rtal of entry of the antigen is normal\u201d (195). Despite the \nobvious importance of the respirator y tract as a portal of entry for antigens which act as allergens, \nthe interest in antigen inhalation as a mode of induction for specific IgE responses has not been \nreflected by the classical i.p. sensitization models. This line was followed by others. McCaskill et \nal. developed an animal model of grass pollen hypersensitivity using primary airway exposure to the \nantigen, although  an injected B. pertussis vaccine was still used as an adjuvant (196). Also, \nSedgwick et al.  reported in 1984 that repeated exposure  of rats to aerosolized OVA induced \ntolerance to subsequent injection of the same antigen (197). In this model, spleen and respiratory \ntract lymph node cells, but not serum from aerosol-challenged animals, were responsible for the \nantigen tolerization (198). Asthma \n 40In human asthma, allergic sensitization is due to primary airway exposure to antigen, through a not \nwell known time course and natural disease history. However, there are few works on allergic \nairway disease that do not distinguish between sensitization and challenge periods (192, 193). \nAnimal models of allergic disease where the first exposure to antigen was not in respiratory tract, \ndepended on IL10 to limit the immune response. Conversely, animal models of asthma with first \nantigen exposure in the respiratory tract did not show dependence on IL10 to generate tolerance \n(199). Moreover, the first exposure to antigen in the airways seems to enri ch local lymph nodes in \nFOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells that mediate tolerance through membrane-bound TGFB. These \nobservations highlighted the fact that the sensitization route determines different immune responses. \nIn this context, the contribution of Treg cells to the development or attenuation of allergic disease \nmay depend on the nature of the allergen and the local microenvironment in which the allergen is \ndelivered. \nThere are also different ways to challenge anim als with an allergen. McCusker et al have \nreported that the route and site of challenge influence the final result of the model (200). Allergen \nadministration can be done via intra-tracheal instillation, a route used in rat asthma models, but \ndifficult in the mouse due to the small size of the animal. Another method is to challenge the \nanimals with aerosols or nebulilzed antigen in a closed box (201-206). Although this approach has \nbeen widely used, the amount of inhaled antigen is not controlled and the antigen can be deposited \non the skin and hair of the animals, and reach the intestine after grooming themselves. Finally, i.n. \ninstillation is the most used method for airway ch allenge and resembles the allergen-specific nasal \nprovocation test in humans (207). I.n. performed on alert animals has been reported to achieve 90% \nantigen deposition in the nasal cavity and less than 3% in the digestive tract (55, 200, 208). \nAlternatively, i.n. challenge can be done under light anesthesia (e.g. with inhaled sevoflurane), \nwhich is less traumatic and may involve less risk of swallowing the allergen by the animal, either \ndirectly or by licking the nose during instillation (209). \n1.4.5.  Pulmonary function  in small labo ratory animals: the FlexiVent  \nThe widespread use of rodents as animal models for lung diseases demanded the development \nof techniques and equipment for pulmonary function testing in mice and rats. The small size of the \nairways was an important challenge to overcome from early studies on pulmonary resistance in mouse, in the late 1980s (210). Two main options exist for pulmoanry function testing in rodents: \ninvasive and noninvasive approaches (211). Each type of technique has its own pros and cons, and \nfactors such as and reliability for each particular experimental pur pose must be considered (212). \nInvasive procedures requiring intubation yield th e most sensitive, specific and accurate data on INTRODUCTION \n \n 41 pulmonary mechanics, and are applicable to the a ssessment of both obstructive and restrictive lung \ndisorders. Because of the tracheal intubation, inva sive approaches by-pass upper airway resistance \nand the measurements are therefore more specific for the lungs. Moreover, invasive pulmonary \nfunction testing under mechanical ventilation ca n determine central and peripheral pulmonary \nmechanics parameters through complex ventilator- driven pressure waves (\u201cperturbations\u201d) and \nmathematical modeling. However, invasive appr oaches have some inconveniences. One such \ninconvenience is the requirement of complex animal instrumentation involving anesthesia and \ntracheostomy, althought the major disadvantage is that invasive pulmonary function techniques are usually terminal experiments, not allowing repetitive measurements in the same animals. \nNoninvasive pulmonary function testing is quick and simple in terms of animal instrumentation, \nsince no anesthesia nor intubation are required, and, as a major advantage, it allows repetitive \nmeasurements. However, noninvasive measuremen ts are not based on a direct assessment of \npulmonary mechanics, and their reliability has been questioned.  \nFor invasive pulmonary function testing, the animals must be anaesthetized with agents such as \nsevoflurane (fluoromethyl hexafluoroisopropyl ether), a general anesthetic also used in humans for \nthe induction and maintenance of general anaesthes ia. It produces denso-dependent central nervous \nsystem, cardiovascular, and respiratory depressant effects (213) and is one of the preferred agents \nfor mask induction due to its lesser irritation on mucous membranes (214). Following anesthesia \nand intubation, neuromuscular blockade is necessary  to put the animal under mechanical ventilation. \nFor this purpose, a paralyzing agent is used such as rocuronium bromide, a competitive \nacetylcholine blocking agent that also exerts a stabilizing effect on the postsynaptic membrane and \nprevents action potentials on the skeletal muscle fibers. The paralysis induced by rocuronium first \naffects highly irrigated fast muscles and then the diaphragm. Once paralysed, the animal is \nsubjected to mechanical ventilation that is usually set at 150-250 breaths/min and 6-10 mL/Kg for \nthe mouse (211, 215). This is achieved by means of a rodent mechanical ventilator such as the \nFlexiVent\n\u00ae (SciReq, Montreal Canad\u00e1) (216). The Flexivent is fitted for inhaled anesthesia and has \na positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) module in  its expiratory arm, which also serves as a \nwasher trap to cleanse the gas output. Since ra ts and mice have small airways and the functional \nresidual capacity (FRC) is largely maintained by inspiratory muscle tone, which is minimal or null \nin the anesthetized animal s, it is important to use PEEP to avoid small airway collapse at the end of \nexpiration. The inspiratory and expiratory arms of the ventilator are connected to the tracheal \ncannule through a Y-tube adapte r provided with two air valves  that work together in each \nrespiratory cycle, and pressure transducers. The main component of the apparatus is a piston pump Asthma \n 42driven by a high-precision linear motor. The exact position of the piston at any given time and its \nmovements, as well as the ventilation settings and pressure waves, are software-controlled \n(FlexiVent 5.2). Following a pressure/volume calibration protocol, the ventilator is able to infer the \ninspiratory volume and flow from the movements of the piston and proper corrections for gas \ncompression. Pulmonary function measurements are obtained using the so-called \u201cforced oscillation \ntechnique\u201d (FOT). For this purpose, the ventilator software briefly interrupts tidal breathing support \nand forces simple or complex sinusoidal pressure waves, called perturbations, on the animal\u2019s \nairway opening. During the perturbations, the ventilator correlates the differential pressure \nmeasured at the transducers with the inferred volumes introduced. From these data sets, the software \nthen calculates pulmonary function variables by applying mathematical models. The models are: (i) \nthe linear first-order single compartment model, which considers all airways and pulmonary \nstructures as a unique compartment; and (ii) the complex constant-phase model, which differentiates \npulmonary mechanics parameters from peripheral and central structures (217, 218). The single \ncompartment model, based on a simple-wave perturbation called \u201csnap-shot\u201d, is the one commonly \nused for general pulmonary function purposes. The main variable obtained is lung resistance (R L), \nwhich reflects the global lung resistance comprising airway (R aw) and tissue (R ti) resistance (210, \n219). R L measurements upon airway challenge with in creasing MCh doses, allows us to evaluate \nairway hyperresponsiveness in these rodent models. Airway hyperresponsiveness to MCh is \nreflected as a peak-like progressive increase in R L.  \n \n2. ALLERGIC RHINITIS \n2.1. General aspects \nAllergic rhinitis is an inflammatory disease that  affects the nasal mucosa and is caused by an \nIgE-mediated hypersensitivity, which is triggered by  sensitization and subsequent allergen exposure \n(220). After allergen exposure, a transient episode of itching an d sneezing begins within seconds \nand wanes 5 to 30 minutes later (221). This early phase is driven by basophils and mast cells that \nrelease pre-formed mediators (such us histamine,  tryptase, leukotrienes, and platelet activating \nfactor). A secondary phase of rhinorrhea and obstruction begins minutes later and can last for hours. \nThis late phase is mainly driven by prostaglandins, interleukins and chemoattractants that elicit the recruitment of eosinophils and neutrophils into the nasal tissue. The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is \nbased on its clinical manifestations. Symptoms in clude pruritus, nasal congestion and irritation, \nrhinorrea and sneezing, and can be accompanied by t earing. The diagnosis is further supported by a \npositive skin prick test, or by the detection of serum specific IgE antibody to aeroallergens INTRODUCTION \n \n 43 (radioallergosorbent test, RAST). Rhinitic symptoms are variable and all these symptoms are not \nnecessarily present in the same patient. The immune system response in allergic rhinitis represents a \nTh2 pattern like asthma. Concerning prevalence, it is estimated that approximately 20% of the \nEuropean population has allergic rhinitis, although the data may be underestimated as many patients \ndo not recognize rhinitis as a disease, and therefore do not consult with a physician. Currently, \nallergic rhinitis is considered the most prevalent atopic disease in the world (30). It has increased \nmore rapidly than asthma in the last 20 years. Alth ough allergic rhinitis is not a severe disease, it \nalters the social life of the patien t (222, 223) and affects work productivity (224). The direct cost of \ntreatments plus indirect costs derived from loss of productivity (225) result in a considerable socio-\neconomic impact.  A study on the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in Western Europe showed that \napproximately 45% of allergic rhinitis patients are not diagnosed (226). Allergen-specific nasal \nprovocation testing allows to evaluate the degree of allergen-specific nasal responses in patients \nwith rhinoconjunctivitis (207). Like in asthma, eosinophils may traffic through regional lymph \nnodes after antigen exposure (227, 228). Once allergens reach the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis \npatients, local antigen presenting cells become activated and migrat e to the regional lymph nodes, \nwhere they activate naive T lymphocytes upon antigen presentation. The antigen-specific T cells \nacquire a Th2 pattern of activation, which drives the allergic response through cytokines such as \nIL9, IL4, IL13 and IL5, specific IgE production by activated B cells, mast cell degranulation and \nfurther pathways (229, 230).  \n2.1.1.  Relationship between allergic rhinitis and asthma \nA number of studies highlighted a link betwee n allergic rhinitis and asthma (231), and \nsuggested that the airways of asthmatics and allergic rhinitis patients respond to allergens with a \nsimilar inflammatory pattern (232). Moreover, sube pithelial fibrosis was found in the nasal mucosa \nof patients with perennial rhinitis (233, 234), therefore suggesting that pathological tissue \nremodeling occurs in association with chronic inflammation in allergic rhinitis, such as in asthmatic \nbronchi (235, 236). \nAllergic rhinitis and asthma often coexist in  the same patient (235) and share similar \ninflammatory patterns (237). Rhinitis and asthma have been suggested to be two manifestation of \none syndrome within two sections of the respirator y tract, an idea that has led to an ongoing debate \non an \u201cairway system integration\u201d theory (220, 238-241). Whether such airway unity concept is an \nacceptable model or not from a phy siopathology standpoint, epidemio logical data have shown an \nassociation between allergic rhinitis and asthma. Approximately 80% of asthmatics have allergic \nrhinitis (235, 239, 242), whereas 15-40% of allergic rhinitis patients have, or eventually develop, Allergic rhinitis \n 44asthma (241). The clinical, pat hological and epidemiological ev idence of a close relationship \nbetween allergic rhinitis and asthma led to the development of a series of workshops on Allergic \nRhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) for joint diagnostic and therapeutic strategies (243). \n2.1.2.  Relationship between the upper and intrapulmonary airways \nThere are several physiologic and anatomical  communication systems between the upper and \nlower airways (235, 238): \n-Naso-bronchial interaction. An allergen deposited in the nares can induce bronchospasm. It has \nbeen proposed that this phenomenon is driven by a nervous network between the nasal cavity and the lower airways, in which the trigeminal nerve (cranial par V that collects the sensitivity of the \nnasal mucosa) is the afferent pathway, and the pneumogastric nerve (cranial par X that provides \ncholinergic innervation to the tracheobron chial tree) is the efferent arm (235). \n-Respiratory tract pathway. Inflammatory mediators from nasal secretions may be aspirated into \nthe lower airways, especially during the night or patients with depressed consciousness and \nimpaired cough reflex (such as mechanically ventilated patients). In this context, IL13 has been \nidentified as a \u201ccommunicator\u201d between th e upper and lower airways (54, 55). \n-Circulatory pathway. Systemic dissemination of inflammatory mediators seems the most \nplausible mechanism for the propagation of inflam mation between the upper and lower airways. It \nhas been proposed that allergic inflammatory responses initiated in the nasal mucosa tend to spread \nsystemically. Eosinophilia and leukocyte activation in peripheral blood induced by nasal challenges \nhave been described (244-246). \n \n2.2. Rhinitis animal models \nMizuno et al.  established in 1991 one of the first animal models of experimental allergic rhinitis \nin guinea pigs  (247). They studied the role of antihistaminic drugs in guinea pigs with induced \nallergic rhinitis. For this purpose, they systemi cally sensitized animals against OVA and performed \nsubsequent challenges to induce a nasal response. They also developed a method to measure \nincreases in i.n. pressure during induced a llergic rhinitis episodes. Later, Yamasaki et al.  established \na guinea pig allergic rhinitis model using i.n. sensitization and challenge with aerosolized OVA \n(248) to study chemical mediators involved in allergic rhinitis, and Zhao et al.  studied in this model \nits similarities with human symptoms (249). A lthough the model did not reproduce all human \nallergic rhinitis symptoms, it achieved considerable similarities such us early and late responses, \nincluding late-phase nasal blockage, increased levels  of IgE, and eosinophilic  infiltration.  These \nauthors also introduced the measur ement of a respiratory rate as an index to reflect nasal blockage. INTRODUCTION \n \n 45 Recently, Suleimani et al.  studied the relationship between nasal airway pressure and lung inflation \npressure in OVA sensitized and challenged guinea pigs and found no correlation (250), although \nthis negative finding may have been due to an excessively short duration of the model.  \nStudies on dogs  have also been performed. The anatomy and physiology of the canine nasal \ncavity was well characterized (251-253), and several canine models of experimental allergic rhinitis \nhave been established (254-257). Models in larg e animals such as dogs may better represent the \nhuman disease and have an advantage as the size of the animal allows for invasive techniques that \nare not necessarily terminal, which facilitates re-tes ting for therapeutic studies. However, the size of \nthe animal implies a high cost of maintenan ce and breeding, and the long life cycle is a \ndisadvantage as compared to rodents.  \nRodents represent a valid and useful experimental tool for the study of allergic diseases, \nincluding allergic rhinitis (221). Compared with rodent asthma models, allergic rhinitis modeling is \nless developed. Few reports are available, whic h mainly focused on acute inflammation (nasal \nobstruction and inflammatory mediators) and less on airway remodeling and upper-lower airway \ncorrelation (221, 258, 259).  \n \n2.3. The murine nasal cavity  \nThere are some studies of the nasal cavity in murine models of allergic rhinitis (260-262). \nHowever, despite the frequent coexistence of allergic rhinitis and asthma in humans, few studies \nanalyzed the nasal cavity in murine asthma models (55, 150, 200, 263). Sampling procedures in the \nmurine nasal cavity, such as nasal lavage  or quantitative morphometry, are technically difficult \n(151), but some data sets have been achieved. In asthma murine models based on i.n. instillation, \n90% antigen deposition in the nasal mucosa has been reported (151, 200). In asthmatics, \neosinophilic inflammation and basal membrane thickening were observed in the nasal mucosa, \nconcomitant with analogue alterations found in bronchial biopsies (233). These data encourage the \nanalysis of the upper airway in murine models of experimental asthma. However, there are few \nallergic rhinitis murine models (221, 261, 262, 264, 265), and the even less studies that have \nconsidered the upper and lower airways together (200, 263). \nIn the 1980s, John T. Young established a protocol for the histopathological study of the nasal \ncavity in the rat (266), where four frontal sections  were studied, from the upper incisor teeth to the \nlast molar (Figure 2). Meticulous anatomical diagrams of the rat and mouse nasal cavity were also \ndone (267) to serve as a guide for comparative stud ies. Based on the similarities between the rat and \nmouse nasal cavity (268), Farraj et al.  adapted the study of the rat nasal cavity to a mouse model of Allergic rhinitis \n 46allergic airway disease (263). In this work, \nonly three sections were set for analysis \nbecause of the smaller size of the mouse \nskull: a proximal section (just posterior to the \nincisor teeth, comprising the nasal turbinates); \na middle section (at the level of the incisive \npapilla in the hard palate, comprising the \nparanasal sinuses); and a distal section (at the level of the second palatal ridge, comprising \nthe etmoidal sinus and nasopharynx). \nThe rodent and human nose cavities have \nsimilar types of epithelia, but with different \nthickness and distribution (221). Interspecies \nvariability in the gross anatomy also exist \n(269). The human nose has three \nnasoturbinates (superior, middle and inferior), \nwheras in rodents, evolutionary pressure \nrelated to olfactory function and dentition \ndefined the shape of the turbinates differently. \nRodents have maxiloturbinates, \nnasoturbinates, and ethmothurbinates, the \nlatter forming the ethmoidal sinuses. Also, \nalthough similar types of epithelium cover the \nnasal cavity in rodents and humans (Figure 3), their distribution is quite different. Approximately \n50% of the nasal cavity is covered by olfactory epithelium in rodents, as opposed to only 3% in \nhumans (268). In the mouse, as for humans, an important function of the nasal cavity is to condition \nthe air, as it is inspired before entering the lower airways. Such conditioning is mainly aimed at \nhumidity and temperature. To hydrate the incoming air, the epithelium of the nasal cavity abounds \nin mucous and serous glands, and goblet cells, whic h all secrete mucous substances that wet the air \nas it passes through. Regarding temperature control, the nasal cavity is profusely irrigated by \nsuperficial blood vessels which, together with abundant venous sinuses, draw a large blood flow in \nthe proximity of the nasal epithelium and work as a heating system. Similarly to humans, the murine \nnasal cavity is provided with two airflow conduct s with protuberances called nasoturbinates and \nFigure 2. Histopathology of the nasal cavity in \nthe rat .

Fundam Appl Toxicol 1981; \n1:309-12) INTRODUCTION \n \n 47 maxiloturbinates, which break and slowdown the \nlaminar airflow, allowing time to condition the \nair before it enters the lower airways. \nAn anterior section section of the nose \n(Figure 4-A) shows the fibro-cartilaginous nasal \nseptum, sagittally oriented to separate the main \nnare conducts. The inciso r teeth roots, which are \ncurved backwards in the mouse, are symmetrically placed besi des the nasal cavity and \ncan be seen as compact de ntin matrix structures. \nLaterally, there are two pairs of turbinates, the \nnaso-turbinates and maxilo-turbinates, from top \nto bottom respectively. Near the bottom of the \ncavity, adjacent to both si des of the septum, there \nis the vomeronasal organ, typical of vertebrates \nbut not developed in humans.   The vomeronasal \norgan is covered by a specialized tissue \nconnected to sensorial ne urons where particular \nmolecules are detected, mainly pheromones. The \nepithelium covering the proximal section of the \nnasal cavity varies depending on the area. At the \nbottom there is non-stratified, non-keratinized \nsquamous epithelium (Figure 3-A). Upper in the \ncavity there is a transition to pseudo-stratified, \nciliated cylindrical respiratory epithelium (Figure \n3-B), provided with a broadly irrigated lamina \npropria . \nIn the mid section of the nasal cavity (Figure \n4-B) a narrowing of the air ducts can be appreciated. In this section, the maxillary \nparanasal sinuses can be observed as lateral \ncavities communicating with the nares. \nFigure 3. The nasal epithelium in the mouse. \nDifferent types of epithelium can be found in the \nmurine nose depending on its location. In the \nanterior zone, there is non-stratified, not \nkeratinized squamous epithelium ( A). Deeper \ninside the nares, there are areas with pseudo-\nstratified, ciliated cylindrical respiratory \nepithelium ( B), comprising basal cells (white \narrows), goblet cells (black arrows) and \ncylindrical ciliated cells (hollow arrows). Finally, \nthe most abundant epithelium, covering the nasal \ncavity is the columnar olfactory epithelium ( C). Allergic rhinitis \n 48Surrounding the paranasal sinuses, there is a mixed glandular tissue formed by serous and mucous \nglands. In this mid region of the nasal cavity, there is respiratory epithelium covering the bottom \nand middle part of the cavity and sinuses. In th e upper part there is a specialized columnar \nepithelium (Figure 3-C), the olfactory epithelium, also profusely irrigated across its lamina propria . \n Figure 4. Frontal histological sections of  the murine nasal cavity, HE stained.  Anterior ( A), mid ( B) \nand posterior ( C) sections are shown. The panels s how the dorsal surface of the nose ( d), hard palate ( p), \nnasal septum ( t), maxiloturbinates ( m), nasoturbinates ( n), dental roots ( r), vomeronasal organ ( v), \nmaxilar ( s) and ethmoidal ( e) sinuses, and the epipharynx ( f). \nINTRODUCTION \n \n 49 A posterior section of the nasal cavity (Figure 4-C) shows the airway as a restricted opening \nbehind the septum, covered by respiratory epithelium, which corresponds to the proximal pharynx \n(homolog to the nasopharynx in humans). The upper part of the posterior nasal section is composed \nof a labyrinth of cavities that form the ethmoidal sinus. The ethmoidal sinus is covered by olfactory \nepithelium. Since this is an area of slow airflow, this provides enough time to allow for olfactory \nparticle deposition over the epithelium of the sinusal structure. \n \n3. THE IMMUNE SYSTEM \nThe human immune system is a complex and fascinating network of cells, tissues, and organs \nthat work in coordination to maintain a \u201chealth status\u201d in the body, despite its continuous interaction \nwith potentially hazardous par ticles and microorganisms. As such, the immune system can \ndistinguish between self and non-self components (such as molecules, viruses, bacteria, or cells). \nAlso, the immune system can identify and eliminate tumor cells by recognising surface antigens \nexpressed by uncontrolled proliferating cells (270-273). All such functions have been acquired and \nimproved for over millions of years of evolution and have made the immune system essential for the \nsurvival of individuals and populations. \n \n3.1. Immune cells \nVirtually all external particles that reach any part  of the body interact with some component of \nthe immune system. First of all, the innate immune system includes all surface, mechanical, and \nmucosal barriers that cover all the surfaces that ar e in contact with the exte rnal environment. Such \nbarriers also comprise resident cells with phagocytic capacity, which mainly belong to the myeloid \nlineage (Figure 5). These cells are monocytes, granulocytes, mast cells and dendritic cells. \nMonocytes originate in bone marrow from monoblasts (which in turn derive from a myeloid \nprogenitor) and circulate in the bloodstream throughout the body. After 24h, monocytes migrate \nfrom the bloodstream to tissues where they will di fferentiate into resident macrophages. The main \nmonocyte/macrophage function is phagocytosis, by which they engulf and destroy pathogens (such \nas microorganisms), whole cells or cell detritus (fro m self or non-self origin ), and other substances. \nFor instance, alveolar macrophages perform an intense cleaning job inside the pulmonary alveoli, where they attempt to phagocyte and destroy all ex ternal particulate substances that are inhaled \nfrom the outside and are potentially harmful. Macrophages also play an important role in \ninflammation, where they can trigger inflammatory  responses by secreting cytokines upon the initial \ncontact with pathogens. Conversely, macrophages can also modulate or switch off inflammation and The immune system \n 50induce reparation (274-277). Another important function of macrophages is that they can also act as \nantigen presenting cells, and participate in hemost asis through the production of substances that \nparticipate in coagulation (278) and fibrinolysis (279). \nThe granulocytes are leukocytes characterized by  densely stained granules in their cytoplasm. \nThe granules store different substances depending on  the type of granulocyte. Neutrophilic granules, \nwhich define the neutrophils, serve as a reservoir for digestive and hydrolytic enzymes, prior to their \ndelivery into the phagosome (274). The main role  of neutrophils in immunity is to take up \nmicroorganisms by phagocytosis and destroy them via intracellular vesicles using hydrolytic enzymes contained within the granules. Neutrophils are abundant in the blood but not normally in \nhealthy tissues. They are short lived and usually die soon after phagocytosis.  Eosinophils and \nbasophils, containing eosinophilic and basophilic granules respectively, are involved in the response \nagainst parasites, which are too large to be ingested by macrophages or neutrophils. Eosinophils \ncontain a range of toxic proteins and inflammatory mediators in their granules. They have two \neffector functions. First, upon activation they release granules containing highly toxic substances to \nkill microorganisms and parasites. Second, their activation induces the synthesis of chemical \nmediators that amplify the inflammatory response by recruiting and activating more eosinophils and \nother leukocytes (280). Upon activation,  basophils release histamine contained in the basophilic \ngranules. They are also present at the site of inflammation, require growth factors similar to \neosinophils, and exert similar functions. In fact, eosinophil degranulation triggers in turn basophil \nand mast cell degranulation (281). \nMast cells protect the internal body surfaces against pathogens an d are involved in  the response \nagainst parasitic worms. They underlay the body surfaces and alert the immune system of local \ninvasion by microorganisms. Once activated, mast cells release prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and \ncytokines contained in their basophilic granules, initiating an immune response against parasitic \nworms and triggering an inflammatory cascade that is amplified by the recruitment of several cell \ntypes, including eosinophils, basophils and Th2 lymphocytes (282). When a response is \ninappropriately triggered, mast cells get directly implicated in the early and late-phase allergic \nreactions. Even in this context, mast cells can exert a dual role depending of the level of stimulation. \nLow allergen concentration results in low receptor occupancy, providing a strong signal that leads to \nallergic inflammation. On the contrary, a high a llergen concentration can induce the production of \nimmunoregulatory cytokines (283).

General view of blood cell lineage. All blood cells arise from pluripotent \nhematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Such pluripontent stem cells differentiate \ninto two major lineages: lymphoid and myeloid. The common lymphoid progenitor \ndifferentiates into T cells, B cells and NK cells, which all enter the bloodstream. B cells \nultimately locate in the B zones of secondary  lymphoid tissues where, upon activation, \nthey mature as antibody-secreting plasma cells . T cells migrate to the thymus, where they \nmature into naive T cells, wh ich are then released into the bloodstream and scan the \nsecondary lymphoid tissues in search of antigen-presenting cells. The common myeloid \nprogenitor divides to produce the granuloc yte, platelet and er ythroc yte linea ges. Dendritic  \ncells arise from both myeloid and lymphoid progenitors within th e bone marrow. They migrate via the blood to tissues throughout  the body. These cells \nmature after they have encountered a potential pathogen and mi grate to the lymph nodes to work as antigen presenting cells. The immune system \n 52In vertebrates, when a novel antigen or pathogen interacts with the body, an adaptive immune \nresponse  follows the innate immune response. The adaptive immune response is much more \ncomplex since it provides specific antigen recognition and memory, and therefore takes a longer \ntime to be achieved. However, once developed, th e immune response to subsequent challenges by \nthe same antigen will be much faster and eff ective. The adaptive immune response is an \nevolutionary improvement only met by vertebrates,  involves most lymphoid cells, and requires the \ncooperation of myeloid cells.  \nDendritic cells, discovered and initially described in 1973 by Nobel Price awardee Ralph M. \nSteinman (284), represent the link between the inna te and adaptive responses of the immune system \n(285, 286). For this reason, dendritic cells are a current research hot topic. Functionally, two types \nof dendritic cells have been described. Plasmac itoid dendritic cells are characterized by specific \nreceptors like Gr-1 and B220, are present in the lungs and seem pivotal in the maintenance of \ntolerance to innocuous inhaled antigens. The other subtype is myeloid dendritic cells, which appear \nto participate in allergic sensitization (287). From the standpoint of their differentiation and \nlocalization in tissues, dendritic cells comprise a wide variety of cells from different haematopoietic \norigins (288, 289), with the co mmon characteristic of working as  antigen presenting cells. They \nhome blood, lymphoid, and non-lymphoid tissues and recognize pathogen-associated molecular \npatterns of microbial products (Toll-like r eceptors, mannose-like receptors, inflammatory \ncompounds released by damaged tissues, etc.). Upon  phagocytosis of a pathogen, the dendritic cell \nacquires a mature phenotype, activates its antigen -presenting machinery, loses the phagocytic \ncapacity, and increases the expression of class-II major hystocompatibility complex (MHC-II). \nMature dendritic cells migrate through the affere nt lymphatic vessels to the T-cell area of local \ndraining lymph nodes. There, th ey select antigen-specific T cells  and induce their activation and \ndifferentiation into effector T cells (primary im mune response). Dendritic cells can even transfer \ntheir MHC-II receptors with bou nd peptide to effector immune cells through a process called \ntrogocytosis, which may be a mechanism of amplification of the immune response (290). \nThe common bone marrow lymphoid progenitor gives rise to two lineages: natural killer (NK) \ncells and lymphocytes. The NK cells circulate in  the blood and have cytoplasmic granules and \ninvariant membrane receptors (which make NK ce lls be considered part of the innate immune \nresponse). The invariant membrane receptors allow NK cells to recognise molecular patterns present \non microorganisms and harmful cells (such as cells infected by viruses or intracellular pathogens, \ntumour cells) as well as to distinguish self versus non-self antigens and cells (291). When a NK cell INTRODUCTION \n \n 53 recognizes a cell as infected or harmful, the cytotoxic granules ar e released onto the surface of the \ntarget cell, where certain granule proteins induce apoptosis. \nLymphocytes are divided into B and T lineages. Both are antigen specific responders, and are \nthe core of the adaptive immune response. B cells  originate in bone marrow, where they begin their \nmaturation process with the pro duction of specific antigen recept ors. During development, each B \ncell undergoes a process of somatic DNA recomb ination called gene rearrangement (292-294), \nwhich results in the expression of a B cell receptor (BCR) onto th e cell surface. All the BCRs of a \nparticular B cell clone are identical and rec ognize a specific antigen epitope. Once gene \nrearrangement is successfully achieve d, B cells are released into th e blood as immature B cells and \nare recruited by secondary lymphoid organs. The production of antigen  receptors is then completed \nand the cells become mature naive B cells. When a naive B cells meets its specific antigen through \nthe BCR, it interacts with a helper T cell and b ecomes an activated B cell. Clonal expansion and \nimmunoglobulin class switch ensue, which then leads to the development of plasma cells that \nproduce a particular immunoglobulin class and the resulting soluble antibodies (295, 296).  \nSince the research work presented in this thesis  was mostly focused on T cells, a more in-depth \naccount of T cell development and function is  presented on the following section. \n3.1.1.  Development of T cells in the thymus \nThe bone marrow microenvironment provides all the necessary signals for lymphocyte survival \nand differentiation into B and T cell lineages from the common lymphoid progenitor. These signals \nare mainly provided by stromal cells, which is a network of specialized non-lymphoid connective \ntissues that form specific contacts with immature lymphocytes by interacting through cell adhesion \nmolecules and their ligands. Stromal cells also pr ovide soluble and membrane-bound cytokines and \nchemokines that control the proliferation and maturation of B lymphocytes. The most important \nfactor for T cell survival and development in the bone marrow is the IL7 cytokine, produced by the \nstromal cells (297). IL7 induces upregulation of IL 7 receptor (IL7R) on early lymphoid progenitors, \npromoting the rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes in B-cell progenitors (298) and \nfavouring the survival of T- cell precursors that migrate to the thymus (Figure 6). \nIn the thymus, there are also early T cell popu lations, named Pro-T cells, which neither express \nthe specific T-cell receptor (TCR, analogue to the BCR) nor other ma rkers of T cell maturation (like \nCD4 or CD8) (299). These Pro-T cell populations, also named double negative (DN) thymocytes, \nare specifically triggered to proliferate and beco me thymocytes committed with the T cell lineage \nthrough interactions with the thymic stroma. DN cells are divided into four stages depending on the \nexpression of Kit (stem-cell factor receptor, essential for B-lineage differentiation), CD25 (the IL2 The immune system \n 54receptor \u03b1-chain), CD44 (a general leucocyte and erythrocyte marker) (300-302), and also other \nmarkers such as CD3, CD4 and CD8. At DN1 st age, thymocytes still express Kit and CD44. In \nthese early maturation steps, as for B cell developm ent and early T cell stages in the bone marrow, \nIL7 is essential for T cell survival. Kit signalli ng is also important for the achievement of DN \nlymphocytes. As soon as thymocytes mature and evolve to the DN2 stage, they express CD25, and \nrearrangement of the T-cell receptor \u03b2-chain locus occurs. As the cells progress into the DN3 stage, \nthey reduce CD44 and Kit expression. If the gene rearrangement is successful, DN3 thymocytes \nexpress a surrogate pre-T-cell receptor called pT \u03b1, which attaches to CD3 on the cell membrane to \nform the pre-T-cell receptor (pre-TCR). These cells lose their CD25 expression and begin \nFigure 6. Development of T cells. T lymphocytes originate in the the bone marrow from a common \nlymphoid progenitor. They subse quently migrate to the thymus, where they undergo positive and \nnegative selection and commit to CD4 or CD8 lineages, becoming matu re but inactive. Mature naive T \nlymphocytes are then released to  the bloodstream and recruited to lymph nodes, where they check for \nspecific antigens presented by antigen presenting cells. Once a naive T cells find its specific antigen, it \nbecomes activated, proliferates, and migrates to the site of inflammation. \nImmature T \nlymphocyte\nBone \nmarrow\nThymus\nBlood \nstreamNaive CD4 T \nlymphocyte \nNaive CD8 T \nlymphocyte \nLymphatic \nnodeActivated T \nlymphocytes\nAPCs\nImmature T \nlymphocyte\nBone \nmarrow\nThymus\nBlood \nstreamNaive CD4 T \nlymphocyte \nNaive CD8 T \nlymphocyte \nLymphatic \nnodeActivated T \nlymphocytes\nAPCsINTRODUCTION \n \n 55 proliferation in the DN4 stage.  The formation of pre-TCR is a check point in thymocyte \ndevelopment that prevents further rearrangements on the \u03b2-chain locus and allows next maturation \nsteps to occur. The pre-TCR:CD3 assembly leads to the expression of both CD4 and CD8 on the \nthymocyte membrane. These double positive (DP) thymocytes make up the majority of thymocytes. \nOnce DP cells cease proliferation, the \u03b1-light chain begins its rearrangement, leading to a TCR and \nDP thymocyte maturation progress. \n3.1.2.  CD4/CD8 lineage choice \nCD4 and CD8 are transmembrane proteins with extracellular domains, which work as co-\nreceptors for invariant MHC-II and MHC-I sites,  respectively (Figure 7)  (303, 304). As such \ninteraction promotes and stabilizes the TCR:MHC engagement. The CD4 and CD8 intracellular \ndomains associate with tyrosine kinases and initiate the TCR signal transduction when enzimatically \nactivated (305). DP thymocytes have a lifespan of approximately 3 days, and are unique among T-\nlineage cells in that they do not express IL7R (they are refractory to IL7) nor most receptors for \nother pro-survival cytokines (306). As a result, DP thymocytes only survive if rescued from \napoptosis through the recognition and engagement to self-peptide:self-MHC complexes born by \nthymus stromal cells, by a process known as \u201cpositive selection \u201d. After the positive selection, such \nthymocytes will again express IL7R an d other survival receptors (306).  \nCD4/CD8 lineage selection is presently explained by the kinetic signalling model  (307). In this \nmodel, DP thymocytes terminate Cd8 but not Cd4 transcription during positive selection (308), \nexpressing steadily diminishing amounts of cell-surface CD8. These intermediate thymocytes \nappear phenotypically as CD4+CD8low cells, yet remain as lineage-uncommitted cells (308). If TCR-\nmediated positive selection signals persist in the presence of the progressive absence of membrane \nCD8, thymocytes differentiate into CD4+T cells. If TCR-mediated positive selection signalling \nceases in the absence of Cd8 transcription, then thymocytes differentiate into CD8+T cells (309), \nwith the subsequent loss of CD4 expression and re-expression of CD8. In summary, CD4+T cell \ndifferentiation is TCR signal dependent, whereas, if TCR signalling is disrupted, IL7R signals \ninitiate Cd8 transcriptiption leading to CD8+T cell differentiation (307). In fact, in vitro  blockade of \nIL7R selectively abrogates the generation of CD8+T cells (310), and the deletion of GF11 (a \nnegative regulator of IL7R expression) selectively increases CD8+T cell differentiation (311). The immune system \n 56 \n Negative selection  \nParallel to the positive selection process in the thymus, there is a lymphocyte maturation stage \ninvolving the depletion of those thymocytes that strongly recognize self-peptide:self-MHC (312). \nAlthough the exact mechanism of the distinction between self versus foreign antigens is not \ncompletely understood, it seems that the signaling weakness and/or the strength of the \nTCR:antigen:MHC complex account fo r turning the thymocyte into an  apoptosis or survival fate \n(313). Therefore, while a strong TCR affinity of  immature T cells for ligands presented in the \nthymus results in apoptosis, the weak inter action between TCR and self-peptide:self-MHC can \ninduce survival and maturation. A similar process also occurs in the bone marrow through antigen \npresenting cells (313). Negative selection taking place in the bone marrow or thymus is termed \ncentral self tolerance , whereas if the selection occurs in se condary lymphoid organs, it is known as \nsecondary self tolerance . During TCR and BCR gene rearrangeme nt, immature lymphocyes bearing \nreceptors that bind to self antigens are induced to  die or become anergic, a process known as \u201cclonal CELL\nCD8+ TcellCD8CD8\nTCRTCR\nCD3CD3 CD3CD3MHCIMHCICELL\nCD8+ TcellCD8CD8\nTCRTCR\nCD3CD3 CD3CD3MHCIMHCIAPC\nCD4+ TcellCD4CD4\nTCRTCR\nCD3CD3 CD3CD3MHCIIMHCIIAPC\nCD4+ TcellCD4CD4\nTCRTCR\nCD3CD3 CD3CD3MHCIIMHCII\nFigure 7. TCR:MHC interaction.  A naive CD4+ T cell interacts with an antigen presenting cell, \nthrough a MHC-II  dimer loaded with a peptide from the processed antigen ( A). The MHC-II receptor \ninteracts with the TCR, and the CD4 extracellular domain stabilizes the interaction, promoting \nactivation of cytoplasmic kinase signalling in the T cell. All cells in tissues are susceptible to be killed \nby cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which recognize antigens  presented on MHC-I molecules ( B). In this case, \nthe CD8 extracellular domain stabilizes the interac tion in a similar way as the antigen presenting \ncell:CD4+T cell interaction. A BINTRODUCTION \n \n 57 deletion\u201d, aimed at making lymphocytes unable to respond against self antigens. Such selection \nprocesses maintain a tolerance status against self antigens, and were demonstrated in the 1980s and \n1990s (314-316). However, a question arises on how thymus stromal cells, or other cells in \nsecondary lymphoid organs, express antigens from the whole body including tissue-specific \nantigens. This seems controlled by a gene called autoimmune regulator  (AIRE) (317), involved in \nenabling the thymus to own a \u201cself antigen database\u201d to test interactions between TCRs of immature \nthymocytes and self-antigens. \n3.1.3.  Minority lymphocyte subsets \nTCRs are dimers formed by pairing \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 or \u03b4 chains. Although the vast majority of T cells \nbear \u03b1:\u03b2 TCRs, there is a minor population of T cells bearing \u03b3:\u03b4 TCRs that differ in the types of \nantigens that are able to recognize, and in th e pattern of receptors expressed. Such TCR \u03b3\u03b4 T cells \nare delivered to the periphery and usually  reside within epithelia. T cells with \u03b3:\u03b4 or \u03b1:\u03b2 TCRs share \na common progenitor; in fact, TCR \u03b3\u03b4 T cells diverge from TCR \u03b1\u03b2 T cells at the DN1 stage. The \ncompromise between both subsets is not yet fully understood, but it seems that the strength of the \nTCR signal, together with Notch signaling, is cr itical in the following steps of T cell maturation \n(318). The Notch signaling pathway is a cell signaling system present in most pluricellular \norganisms (319) and implicated in lymphocyte development (320, 321). In fact, in humans, an early \ndecrease in NOTCH  activation results in TCR \u03b3\u03b4 T cell lineage differentiation, while sustained \nsignalling from the DN1 stage results in a TCR \u03b1\u03b2 phenotype (322). In contrast with TCR \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, \nTCR\u03b3\u03b4 T cells display a TCR repertoire of limited diversity ( \u03b3:\u03b4 TCRs result from few DNA \nrearrangements) and recognize an tigens through CD1 receptors (a subtype of MHC-I that mainly \nrecognizes lipids) (323). Because their TCRs are relatively invariant, and respond effectively \nwithout clonal expansion, TCR \u03b3\u03b4 T cells belong to a subclass of lymphocytes called innate-like \nlymphocytes (ILLs). However, recombination activating gene (RAG)-1 and RAG-2 recombinases \nare necessary for the gene rearrangements that lead to \u03b3:\u03b4 TCRs, and therefore TCR \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are \nconsidered cells of the adaptive immune system by definition. \nAnother subset of ILLs is the NKT cells (324). These cells derive from immature DN \nthymocytes (325), bear \u03b1:\u03b2 TCRs of limited diversity, and usually express an NK1.1 receptor (326), \ncommonly found on NK cells (327). There is a subs et of NKT cells that also express the CD4 \nreceptor (328). The NKT cells play an important role in both innate and adaptive immune responses \nby recognizing specific glycolipid antigens, presented by CD1, and by their rapid secretion of \ncytokines like IL4, IL10 and IFNG (329). NKT cells  are believed to be involved in inflammation, \nand in polarizing Th1/Th2 and antitumour responses. The immune system \n 583.1.4.  How naive T cells become activated effector T cells \nThe activation of a naive T cell by an antigen is a complex process that needs the participation \nof the innate immune system. An tigens reach the body through a mucosal surface or a cut in an \nepithelium. Microorganisms and other pathogens typically bear a repetitive molecular structure \npattern on their surface proteins. These structur es are known as pathogen-associated molecular \npatterns (PAMPs), which signify the presence of non-self for the immune system. Innate immune \ncells recognize PAMPs through receptor families such as macrophage ma nnose receptors (330), \nscavenger receptors (331), Toll-like receptors (TLR s) (332, 333) and mannal- binding lectins (334). \nThe innate immune system cells phagocytize and destroy pathogens that pass trough natural \nbarriers, and also produce large amounts of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines. These in turn \nstimulate the activation of T cells  and induce their differentiation in to different types of effector \ncells. Antigens or pathogens that pass trough mu cosal surfaces are ingested and processed by \nantigen presenting cells, which are mainly tissue-re sident dendritic cells that take up antigens and \nbecame activated. This indu ces their migration to local lymphoi d tissues attracted by chemokines, \nwhich are produced by the lymph node stroma and high endothelial venules (CCL19, CCL20 and \nCCL21). In the secondary lymphoid tissues, the antigens are presented to naive T cells by the \nantigen presenting cells (335). A lternatively, if antig ens reach the blood, antigen processing and \npresentation by antigen presenting cells is carried out in the spleen. \nAfter T cell maturation occurs in the thymus, naive T cells are released into the blood stream \nand enter the peripheral lymphoid tissues (spleen, lymph nodes, mucosal associated lymphoid \ntissue) through specific adhesion  receptors such as selectins,  integrins, members of the \nimmunoglobulin superfamily, and mucin-like molecules (336, 337). The T cells move through the \nsecondary lymphoid organs, scanning, with thei r specific TCRs, antigen:MHC complexes presented \nby antigen presenting cells. If no recognition occurs , T cells leave the lymphoid tissues and go back \ninto the bloodstream to the next organ. Each naive T cell bearing a specific TCR samples thousands \nof antigen:MHC complexes a day on the surface of  antigen presenting cells. When a naive T cell \nrecognizes its specific an tigen on the surface of an antigen presenting cell, it stops migrating and T \ncell activation ensues. A unique, activated naive T ce ll generates a clone of effector T cells with \nidentical antigen specificity , by a process called clonal expansion. Apart from the \nTCR:peptide:MHC interaction, co-stimulatory sign als are also required to  induce T cell activation \nand clonal expansion (338). B7 is a dimeric, trans-membrane, co-stimulator protein, belonging to \nthe immunoglobulin superfamily, and is expressed on activated dendritic cells in the lymph nodes. \nNaive T cells express the B7 counter receptor on their membrane, which is CD28 (also an INTRODUCTION \n \n 59 immunoglobulin superfamily molecule). CD28:B7 ligation provides a survival signal to the T cell, \nnecessary to initiate clonal expansion (339), IL2 secr etion, and IL2R expression (340). Furthermore, \ncytokines are required to differentiate prolifera ting T cells towards different types of effector T \ncells, as discussed later. Once proliferation occurre d, T cells differentiate into effector T cells and \ndo not require any other co-stimulatory signal to act (341). Activated effector T cells leave the \nlymph nodes via the efferent lymph vessels and reach the bloodstream, ready to exit at sites of \ninflammation. If there is a point of infection, the innate immune cells secrete TNFA that induces \nlocal inflammation. Furthe rmore, on the surface of the local en dothelium, the adhesion molecules \nVCAM1 (CD106) and ICAM1 (CD54) are expressed and recognized by VLA-4 and LFA-1 \nrespectively on the effector T lymphocytes (342), resulting in effector T cell recruitment. \n3.1.5.  Main and minor T cell subsets \nAs mentioned above, naive T cells fall into two large groups. The first bears CD8 co-receptor \non their surface and the other CD4. Almost all CD8 T cells differentiate into CD8 cytotoxic (CT) T \ncells. CT cells recognize foreign antigens attached  to MHC-I molecules and kill cells that present \nsuch antigens, by direct contact or by releasing cytokines (343) like IFNG, which can block viral \nreplication or even lead to the el imination of viruses from infected  cells without killing them (344). \nWhen effector CT cells recognize an antigen on the surface of a ta rget cell, cytotoxic granules \ncontained in the cytoplasm are released into the cy toplasm of the target ce ll by a calcium dependent \nmechanism (345). These cytotoxic granules contain enzymes and proteins such as perforin, \ngranzymes and granulysin (346), that trigger apoptosis of target cells (343). \nCD4 T cells differentiate into helper  T cells and regulatory T cells , depending on the co-\nstimulatory signals that accompany the activation process. Helper an d Treg cells differ in function, \nmembrane receptors and cytokine secretion patterns.  Helper T cells provide essential signals for the \nadaptive immune responses. The T helper (Th)-1 cells activate macrophages to enhance their \nefficiency at killing engulfed pathogens, and stimulate  the production of antibodies against \nextracellular pathogens by producing co-stimulatory signals for antigen-activated B lymphocytes. \nThe Th2 cells activate antigen-stimulated B cells  to differentiate and produce antibodies, \nparticularly of the IgE class, which is involved in the response against parasites. A more recently \ndefined subset, the Th17 cells, is involved in the immune response against extracellular bacteria and some parasitic worms by inducing a neutrophilic re sponse. There is also a recently described subset, \nTh9 (347, 348), which seems to originate from \u201creprogrammed\u201d Th2 cells under TGFB influence \n(348) and may be implicated in asthma pathogenesis through IL9 production (349). The immune system \n 60Treg cells are a heterogeneous group of cells with different developmental origins but with a \ncommon immunosuppressor role. They act through cell contact and secrete immunoregulatoty \ncytokines to modulate the responses against innocuous antigens that do not warrant a defensive \nimmunological response. As such, the main goal of Treg cells is immunological tolerance. There are \ndifferent types of Treg cells depending on their origin. Natural Tregs  (nTregs) are generated in the \nthymus and play an essential role in balancing the immune system, and preventing autoimmune \nreactions mediated by self-reactive effector T ce lls that escape negative selection in the thymus \n(350). Another type, adaptive Tregs  (aTregs), appear to develop in the periphery from uncommitted \nnaive CD4+ T cells. Adaptive Tregs are a heterogeneous population comprising different subsets, \ndefined by their origin and their pattern of secreted  cytokines. Examples of aTregs are the so-called \nTR1, T H3 and others. \n3.1.6.  Helper T cells \nThe differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into different subsets of  effector T cells occurs during \nthe progression of an adaptive response, and depends on the stimulatory signals delivered by antigen \npresenting cells and the inflammatory milieu (351) (Figure 8). \nTh1 response \nThe differentiation of effector CD4+ T cells into the Th1 and Th2 subsets was first described by \nMosmann et al.  in the 1980\u2019s (352). The Th1/Th2 differentiation is accompanied by extensive \nmodifications of the chromatin structure at the lo ci encoding Th1 and Th2 cytokines (353, 354). The \nTh1 subset is involved in the response against prolonged or chronic infections, when an effector \nresponse is necessary to eliminate pathogens that can survive inside the phagocitic cells. The Th1 \nresponse activates macrophages and CT T cells, to  respond against viruses and other intracellular \npathogens (such as mycobacteria and some other bacterial and protozoa genera), and also activate B \ncells to produce IgG, to opsonize pa thogens and infected cells (355). \nDuring chronic infection, activated cells such as macrophages, endothelial cells or dendritic \ncells, produce chemokines (CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5) that bind to CCR5 and CCR1 receptors on \ndendritic cells and, along with antigen TCR recogn ition, stimulate the production of IL12 and IFNG \n(356). IL12 and IFNG (357, 358) stimulate naive T cell differentiation (359) through the JAK-STAT \nintracellular signalling pathway, which in turn indu ces activation of transducer and activator of \ntranscription (STAT)-4 and STAT1 (360). These signal-transducing activators of transcription \ninduce Tbet expression, which leads to Th1 cell activation, inhibits Th2 differentiation (361), and \nstimulates the production of IL2 and IFNG (362). INTRODUCTION \n \n 61 There is research interest in the regulation of  Th1/Th2 differentiation signals because this was \nthe first diversion of the CD4+ T cell-driven immune response to be defined, and and its regulation \nis not yet fully understood.  \n \nTh2 response  \nThe Th2 immune response leads the defense against extracellular pathogens and parasitic \nworms, and is also involved in allergic diseases. Mature CD4+ T cells committed with Th2 effector \nfunction secrete a cytokine pattern that defines this T cell subset, which includes IL4, IL5, and IL13. \nIL4 is a key cytokine promoting Th2 differentiation from naive T cells and, together with IL13, \ninduces B cells to switch to IgE production ( 363, 364). IL5 is a potent chemoattractant for \neosinophils (365). \nPathogen-driven Th2 development is less understood than the Th1 response. The pathways \nlinking the innate immunity to the induction of Th2 adaptive responses are under current research, \nand the exact mechanism that initiates Th2 cytokine production is unknown, although some Figure 8. Differentiation of CD4 T cells  depending on stimulatory signals. After leave thymus, \nCD4+ T cells can differentiate into several phenotyp es in peripheral lymphoid organs depending on \nthe inflammatory microenvironment. This include ef fector phenotypes that coordinate an adaptive \ninflammatory response pattern through cytokine secr etion; but also severa l regulatory phenotypes \nthat limit and control the immune res ponse triggered by effector phenotypes.

As an alternative explanation \nhas been proposed that, if an infection is caused by pathogens that do not trigger Th1 cytokine \nrelease (IL12, TNFA), small amounts of IL4 produced by some cells in the immune response can \ndominate and induce Th2 differentiation by default. TCR stimulation upon IL4 signalling induces \nexpression of the trans-acting T-ce ll-specific transcription factor GA TA3, which plays a central role \nin compromising naive T cells with  the Th2 lineage (370, 371). In f act, GATA3 expression is key to \ninduce Th2 differentiation (370), and inhibits Th 1 activation (372), through a STAT4 inhibition \nmechanism (373). GATA3 can also change the phenotype of committed Th1 cells by a chromatin remodeling mechanism (371), and has been shown to  be essential for thymocyte maturation at DN3 \n(374) and SP (375) stages. GATA3 promot es the opening of chromatin at the IL4 locus during early \nTh2 differentiation (376) and controls the expression of IL5 (377) and IL13 (378) in committed Th2 \ncells, but it is not essential for IL4 expression (3 75). Despite the central role known for GATA3 in \nTh2 activation, another pathway involving STAT5 has been described, which can act in a GATA3-\nindependent manner (376, 379). STAT5 expression is dependent on IL2 signalling, which can \ninduce Th2 differentiation through this mechanism (380, 381). GATA3 and STAT5 may therefore \ncollaborate to induce IL4 production, because both transcription factors bind directly to different \nsites of the Il4 locus and modulate its expressi on in naive CD4 T cells (376). \nOnce effector CD4\n+ T cells are committed towards a Th2 phe notype, clonal expansion is driven \nby an IL4 dependent mechanism. When a TCR of a mature CD4+ T cell recognizes a specific \nantigen in the presence of IL4, it induces proliferation of mature Th2 cells by growth factor \nindependent 1  (Gfi1) activation through STAT6 (382). In fact, activation of Stat6 transcription \nupstream of Gfi1 is sufficient to induce proliferation on mature Th2 cells (383). STAT6 can in \nparallel induce GATA3 expression by an unknown mechanism and therefore IL4 secretion (376). \nThus, the sustained presence of a pathogen may produce an IL4 rich milieu that activates Stat6  \ntranscription. STAT6 may activate Gfi1 transcription and Th2 prolifferation, and may also induce a \npositive feedback on Gata3  expression, both resulting in a maintained Th2 response in the tissue. \nTh17 response \nUpon encountering a pathogen, dendritic cells usually respond by synthesizing IL6 and TGFB. \nThese cytokines together, in the absence of other cytokines such as IL4, IFNG or IL12, induce naive CD4\n+ T cell differentiation into Th17 cells (384, 385), and inhibit Th1 and Th2 differentiation.  \nIn the mid 1990s, Yao et al.  described and characterized IL17 as a novel cytokine produced by \nT cells in response to particular pathogens (386, 387). IL6 and TGFB activat e a transcription factor \ncalled signal Stat3  in mice, which in turn induces the expression of orphan nuclear receptor ROR \u03b3\u03c4 INTRODUCTION \n \n 63 in developing Th17 cells (388, 389). ROR \u03b3\u03c4 induces the transcription of the gene encoding IL17, \nand is a key transcription factor for the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into effector Th17 cells \n(390, 391). This effector subset is mainly implicated in the defe nce of mucosal surfaces, especially \nin the lung, against extracellular pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae  (392), Borrelia \nburgdorferi,  Mycobacerium tuberculosis  (393) or even helminth parasites (394). During infection \nby such pathogens in the lung, Th17 cells produce IL17, which induces granulocyte colony \nstimulating factor (GCSF) expression and granulocyte recruitment to the lung parenchyma (395). \nIL17 stimulates stromal cells in vitro  to produce proinflammatory and hematopoietic cytokines (like \nIL6 and IL8), chemokines, and prostaglandin E2 (396), which may play a role in the recruitment of \nneutrophils, and the differentiation of local monocytes into macrophages. GCSF is drawn back to \nthe bone marrow to increase the production of ne utrophils and macrophages. Work done with \nknock-out animal models, and research on human immunological disorders, has allowed to link the \nfailure of the Th-17 response with autoimmune disorders such as encephalitis and arthritis (397), \nand allergic diseases like asthma (398). \n3.1.7.  Regulatory T cells \nAlready in the 1970s, Gershon et al.  realised that there were T cell populations able to confer \ntolerance to recipient animals when transferred from antigen-tolerant donors (399). Immunologists \ndescribed then a cell type with immunomodulatory activity, which mediated tolerance in skin \nallograft experiments, and named this cell type \u201csuppressor T cells\u201d (400). However, the lack of \nspecific markers to identify and isolate this subs et prevented a clear definition and hampered the \nstudy of suppressor T cells until more than two d ecades later. Nevertheless, during that interim \nperiod some investigators pursued work on the \u201csuppressor T cells\u201d, reporting implication in several \npathologies and defining in vitro  and in vivo  characteristics (401-404). Scattered and inconsistent \nresults from the latter led to a confusing stage about this cell type, and the term \u201csuppressor T cells\u201d \nconsequently dissipated (405). Despite the controversies on immune regulation and the \u201csuppressor \nT cells\u201d, some investigators continued working on poorly defined cell subsets that seemed to \nexerted tolerant properties, but the term \u201csuppre ssor\u201d was in general avoided (406). In the early \n1990s Sakaguchi et al.  demonstrated a T cell subset responsible for restoring thymus-ablated mice \nto a healthy tolerant state (407, 408). In thei r work, mice suffering from a severe autoimmune \nsyndrome after thymectomy could be rescued by adoptive transfer of a CD4+CD25+ T cell \nsubpopulation from healthy animals. Subsequent experiments by Thorton et al.  demonstrated the \ninhibitory properties of CD4+CD25+ cells on effector T cell activation in vitro  (409). Further work \nto characterize this immunoregulatory CD4+CD25+ cell subset followed and, in the 21st century, The immune system \n 64Hori et al. , Fontenot et al.  and Khattri et al.  demonstrated by independent work (410-412) that the \nforkhead box P3 (FOXP3) transcription factor controled the development of immunoregulatory \nCD4+CD25+ T cells able to inhibit T effector response s against self-antigens. These cells appeared \nto maintain a tolerogenic state of the body to self-antigens. In fact, defects in the FOXP3  gene, \nlocated in X chromosome, underlie the human syndrome called X-linked neonatal diabetes mellitus, \nenteropathy, and endocrinopathy (IPEX) (413), an autoimmune inflammatory disease caused by an \nuncontrolled activation and expansion of CD4+ T cells (414). Furthermore, a defect in the Foxp3  \nlocus is also linked with a fatal lymphoproliferative disorder in mice (\"Scurfy\" phenotype) (415). Experiments in mice revealed that glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor family-\nrelated gene (GITR) is necessary, at least in vitro , for Treg mediated suppression of effector T cells \n(416). However, although FOXP3 is  considered a good Treg cell ma rker in mice, this seems less \nclear in humans (417). Cells with out FOXP3 expression that exert regulatory functions (418-420), \nand non-regulatory cells with transient FOXP3 expression, have been recently described (421-423). \nIn fact, it has been reported th at TCR activation slightly upregulates FOXP3 expression without \nleading to any immunoregulatory functions (424). Although some FOXP3-associated markers such \nas low IL7 receptor expression (CD127\nLOW) (425) and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) \n(426) have been recently described to identify human Treg cells, a key marker remains missing in \nhumans. \nTreg cell development and suppression mechanisms \nTreg cells can be described as a heterogeneous group stemming from diverse developmental \norigins that maintains immune homeostasis, prevents autoimmunity and moderates inflammation. \nThere are different Treg phenotypes, including a regulatory effector-memory phenotype, \ncaracterized by CCR6 expression, which seems to fu nction as a counterbalance to common effector-\nmemory T cells (427). Also, depending on different MHC-II expression, a spectrum of suppressor \ncapacities can be found among the Treg populati on (428). Therefore, defects in the Treg \ndevelopment or function may result in different autoimmune diseases (351, 429, 430).  \nThe transcription factor FOXP3 seems to be centr al to immune regulation, and it is expected \nthat complex transcription mach inery controlling its expression ex ists. Recent experiments have \nshown epigenetic regulatory mechanisms acting at the Foxp3  locus (431). Upstream the Foxp3 \nlocus there is an evolutionarily conser ved CpG-rich element that works as a Foxp3  expression \nenhancer, and whose demethylation status correlates with the FOXP3  expression level. This T \nregulatory specific demethylated region  (TSDR ) is demethylated in nTreg cells with stable FOXP3 \nexpression but remains methylated in FOXP3- T cells (350). However, FOXP3 expression can be INTRODUCTION \n \n 65 achieved independently from the TSDR  methylation status. Thereby, TGFB can induce Foxp3  \nexpression in CD4+CD25- cells in peripheral tissues, but no  epigenetic changes are induced in TSDR  \nafter TGFB stimulation (350). Indeed, it seems that regulatory T cell function, but not lineage \ncommitment, requires Foxp3  expression (432). Also, several immunological cell subsets without \nFoxp3  expression have shown regulatory properties in immune responses (433). Nowadays, 40 \nyears after the first attempts to describe \u201csuppresso r\u201d cells, there is still a lack of a molecular marker \nto identify immunoregulatory cells. In fact, it is presently know from experimental approaches that \nimmunoregulatory cell subsets do exist, and this field has proven to be more complicated than just a regulatory/non-regulatory phenotype issue. Possibly, regulatory properties are not a characteristic of \njust one defined cell type, but an atribute of vari ous cell subsets that can ex ert a regulatory function \nin a particular tissue environment. Moreover, Tr eg cells seem to be involved, not only in the \ntolerance to self-antigens or the attenuation of late immune responses, but also in early immune \nresponses to local viral infections (434). Conversely, the involvement of Treg cells in the \nmaintenance of chronic infection has also been proposed (435). Defects in Treg cells have been \nrelated to failure in the suppression of anti-tumour responses, contributing to disease progression in \nseveral types of tumors (435).  \nFOXP3\n+ Treg cells are linked to the immunomodulatory cytokines IL10 and TGFB (436-439). \nSeveral signals seem to be important for Treg phenotype commitment in nTregs. First, IL2 is \nnecessary for T cell growth in the thymus and acts through the IL2 receptor (CD25), also expressed \nin nTregs, which are entirely dependent on paracrine IL2 for survival and growth (440, 441). \nHowever, IL2 it is not necessary for the regulatory  function (442). Second, the interaction between \nB7 and CD28, important as well for lymphocyte survival in the thymus, seems also important for \ncontrolling autoimmune diseases through a mechanism requiring the expression of cytotoxic T-\nLymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4) (443). CTLA4 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily \nthat binds to B7, acting as a CD28 homologue, but transmits instead an inhibitory signal on T cell \nactivation (444). TCR stimulation in naive T cells s timulates transient expression of CTLA4 (445), \nwhich may prevent self-reactive pathogenic T cell from acting (446). Foxp3 upregulates CTLA4 \nexpression (447), which is in turn constitutively expressed on the surface of nTregs (411, 448). \nCTLA4 expression allows nTreg cells to interact w ith B7 expressed on antig en presenting cells and \ndownregulate their ability to activate effector T ce lls (449) (Figure 9). A third factor that seems \nimportant for nTreg development is the nature of the interaction between the TCR on lymphocytes \nand the MHC on antigen presenting cells (450), alth ough the pathways inducing gene expression so \nas to confer immunoregulatory properties to  Treg cells are still unknown. The Rel-NFKB The immune system \n 66transduction pathway has been linked to the generation of nTreg cells (451, 452). Isomura et al.  \nidentified the NFKB pathway transcription factor c-Rel as critical to generate normal amounts of T \nreg cells (453), and this finding was further supported by Visekruna et al.  and Deenick et al.  (454, \n455). FOXP3 also associat es with the nuclear fact or of activated T cells (NFAT) to induce a Treg \nphenotype (447), and interacts as well with the tr anscription factor AML1/Runx1 to inhibit IL2 and \nIFNG production (456). It seems therefore logical that a transcription factor such as FOXP3 would \nstimulate not just one gene but several (457, 458), and thus would regulate parallel pathways, which \nalltogether determine the regulatory phenotype.  \n \nNatural Treg cells may also act through contact-independent mechanism, via cytokines. \nUpregulation of Ebi3 , a member of the IL12 family that ma y be a downstream target for FOXP3, \nhas been recently observed in FOXP3+ T reg cells (459). EBI3 pairs with IL12alpha in the Figure 9. Dual antigen presenting cell:Tcell interaction.

IL35 suppresses effector T cell proliferation in vitro  (460), induces prolif eration of Treg cells \n(461), and may attenuate effector T cells in ac ute and chronic infections and in autoimmune \ndiseases. Treg cells also secrete IL10 and/or TGFB, probably depending on the nature of pathogens \nand tissue environment, to control infections or inflammatory diseases (462, 463). IL10 and TGFB \nare implicated in various disease settings involving Treg cells (463). IL35 is not expressed in all \nhuman nTreg cells (464), and the exact function and settings in which the suppressor cytokines \nIL35, IL10, and TGFB exert inhibitory roles in Treg cell-mediated regulation remains to be clarified.  \nGranzymes are serine proteinases that enter targ et cells and mediate activation of intracellular \ncaspases, leading to apoptosis. Granzyme-mediated cy tolisis is typically induced by cytotoxic cells, \nsuch as NK cells and CT lymphocytes. Granzymes are contained in cytoplasmic granules that are \nreleased into the target cell cytoplasm through pe rforines. Surprisingly, ac tivated human Treg cells \nexpress granzymes A and B (465), which would theoretically provide them with a cytotoxic \npotential. In the mouse, granzyme B expression is upr egulated in Treg cells and makes them able to \nkill B cells, resulting in the suppression of B cell function (466). Mice deficient in granzyme B have \nreduced Treg suppressive activity in vitro (467). Treg cells can also release adenosine nucleotides \n(468-470), which bind to the ad enosine A2A receptor on effector  T cells. Activation of the A2A \nreceptor inhibits effector T cell function and leads to the generatio n of adaptive or inducible Tregs \n(iTregs) from effector T cells (471). Another mech anism that the Treg cells use to modulate the \nimmune response is to interact directly with  dendritic cells. The differential expression of the \ntransmembrane glycoprotein neuropilin 1 (NRP1)  on Treg cells, which promotes prolonged \ninteraction between Tregs and immature dendritic cells  (472), provides Treg cells with an advantage \nover naive T cells. Subsequently, Treg cells expre ss lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), which is \na CD4 homologue that binds MHC-II molecules with a very high affinity and blocks dendritic cell \nmaturation (473). Treg cells can also interact with dendritic cells through CTLA4 and induce the \nproduction of immunosuppressive molecules that suppress effector T cells (474, 475). \nFrom the mechanisms by which Treg cell subsets can act, it is difficult to elucidate whether \nthere is a key common pathway, or multiple redund ant or non-redundant pathways, to initiate and \nmaintain immunological tolerance. Vignali et al. proposed a mechanism of tolerance induction by \nintegrating all such mechanisms into a model by which regulatory T cells use one or another \ninhibitory pathway depending on the environmental context (463). However, no experimental \ndemonstration has been achieved for this theory to date, and further research is warranted.  The immune system \n 68Other regulatory cell subtypes \nThe first immunoregulatory cells to be discovered and characterized were nTregs, the \nCD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells naturally arising from the thymus . In recent years, different subsets of \niTregs were described, which differentiate in the secondary lymphoid organs under different \ncytokine and antigen exposure profiles. At pr esent, a variety of FOXP3-expressing and non-\nexpressing Tregs, arising from different developing origins, have been described. However, \nindependently on their origin and characteristics,  iTreg cell subsets share common functions: to \nmaintain tolerance by suppressing potential effector responses against innocuous antigens and to control the normal immune response against infections (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1.

Latter, in 1997, they described from thei r findings a regulatory cell subset that was called \nType 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1). This subset was able to suppress the proliferation of CD4+ T cells \nthrough the secretion of IL10 and TGFB, and prevented colitis induced in severe combined \nimmunodeficiency mouse by pathogenic CD4+CD45+ splecnic T cells (477). The stimulation of \nCD4+T cells in the presence of IL10 generated Tr1 cells, which inhibited antigen-specific immune \nresponses and prevented disease in the colitis model. IL10 dependent Tr1 cells have shown in vitro  \nand in vivo  inhibitory capacities over naive CD4+ T cells in both humans and rodents (478), and INTRODUCTION \n \n 69 share immunosuppressive activities with nTregs (479, 480). Contrary to nTregs, Tr1 cells are \ninvolved in the regulation of the immune response against foreign antigens. Since Tr1 cells work in \nthe absence of FOXP3 expression (480, 481), it must be highlighted that, although FOXP3 plays an \nimportant and necessary role for nTreg regulatory functions, it is not currently considered a \u201cmaster \nregulator\u201d for all cells with imm unoregulatory capacities. In fact, eff ector T cells transiently express \nFOXP3, although its role in this case is unknown (481). \nTh3 regulatory cells \nIn 2003, contemporarily with the demonstration of the role of FOXP3 in nTregs, Chen et al.  \nshowed that peripheral CD4+CD25- T cells may become iTreg cells by costimulation through their \nTCR and TGFB (482). Moreover, such cells inhibit specific CD4+ T cell responses in vivo  and \nprevent HDM-induced allergic reactions in the lung. This cell subset, which showed an nTreg-like \nimmunoregulatory phenotype, was called Th3. Recen t experiments have show n that TGFB induces \ntransient FOXP3 expression in Th3 cells, but does not modify the methilation status of the TSDR \nupstream Foxp3  locus (350). A parallel mechanism to induce Foxp3  expression independent from \nTSDR methilation, may exist in Th3 cells. Like Tr1 cells, Th3 cells are mainly generated in the gut-\nassociated lymphoid tissues (GALT) by a process involving dendritic cells and intestinal epithelial \ncells (483, 484). Tolerance induction is the default immune pathway in the gut, and the Th3 and Tr1 \nsubsets seem responsible for oral tole rance to ingested antigens (485, 486). \nDouble negative regulatory T cells \nDouble negative regulatory T cells (DN Treg) were first described in 2000 by Zhang et al. , who \nreported a novel murine cell subset of CD4-CD8- Treg cells that inhibited CD8+ T cell responses of \nthe same TCR specificity (487). DN Treg cells express a characteristic set of surface markers ( \u03b1\u03b2-\nTCR+CD3+CD4-CD8-CD25+CD28-CD30+CD44-) and, contrary to other regulatory subsets, do not \nproduce IL10, IL2, IL4 or IL13 (487) nor FOXP3 (488). These cells induce apoptosis on CD8+ T \ncells of the same TCR specificity requiring dir ect intercellular contact (489, 490). DN T cells \naccount for 1-5% of peripheral \u03b1\u03b2TCR+CD3+ T cells (491, 492).  Contrary to nTregs and similar to \niTregs, DN Treg cells have extrathymic development. Early thymectomy does not abrogate their \ndevelopment nor suppressive function in peripheral lymphoid tissues (491). DN Tregs can \ndifferentiate in vitro  (493), where TCR stimulation plus exogenous IL2 and IL4 are required for \ntheir expansion (491). Therefore, DN Treg cells need TCR stimulation to exert their regulatory \nfunction (487, 488). During their activation, DN Treg cells uptake MHC-peptide complexes from \nantigen presenting cells, in an antigen-specific manner via their TCR. Then, the acquired MHC-\npeptide complexes interact with the TCR of target CD8+ cells (487). The immune system \n 70DN Treg cells are implicated in allo- and xenogr aft transplantation tole rance (494) and mediate \nthe inhibition of graft-versus-host disease in mice (495). The analysis DN Treg cell homing \nreceptors revealed that CXCR5 expression is importa nt for their homing to transplanted heart grafts \n(496). DN Treg cells can also suppress syngeneic CD4+ T cells through inhibition of IL2 production \n(497), and have the ability to k ill allogeneic lymphoma cells (498), inhibit autoimmune disease \n(499) and lyse B lymphocytes (490). There is therefore current interest on the potential use of DN \nTreg cells to inhibit clonal expansion of allo- an d xenograft T cells after transplantation (500-502), \nand other potential applications in the field of immune-mediated diseases.  \nCD8+ regulatory T cells \nIn the early 1990s, several studies pointed to CD8+ T cells as mediators of tolerance in \nexperimental allergic encephalomyelitis (503), and provided  evidence that CD8+ T cell regulatory \nsubsets (CD8+ Tregs) participate in the regula tion of immune responses (504). CD8+ Treg cells are \ninvolved in oral (505) and neonatal tolerance (506-508), and have been implicated in diverse \nfunctions of peripheral tolerance and in  immune-related diseases (508-510). CD8+ Treg depletion \nabrogates tolerance  in vivo , whereas adoptive transfer of CD8+ Treg cells mediates tolerance in \nsyngeneic naive rats. A subset of CD8+ T cells was found responsible for increased survival of \ntransplanted mice that received repeat ed feeding with an oral alloantig en (511). The vast majority of \nCD8+ subsets with immunoregulatory activity is primed through the TCR during the immune \nresponse to foreign or self-antigens (512). \nThe CD8+ Treg immunoregulatory mechanism is similar to that seen for nTregs. There is \ninhibition of Th1, Th2 and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells through paracrine IL4, IFNG and IL10 (512), and \nmodulation of antigen presenting cells (513). For the latter, CD8+ Treg cells interfere with the CD40 \nsignalling pathway of the dendritic cells, and this abrogates NFKB activation and dendritic cells \nmaturation, resulting in the generation of tolerogenic antigen presenting cells. Subsequently, naive \nCD4+ T cells that interact with tolerogeni c dendritic cells became anergic (512). \nA wide spectrum of CD8+ Treg subsets has been reported (512), but their study is hampered by \nthe lack of a specific marker. The existence of CD8+ Treg cells and their involvement in immune \ndiseases is now undisputed (514), although they represent a minor subset of the CD8+ T cells. It is \nvery difficult to isolate CD8+ Treg cells from total CD8+ T cells, and their suppressor abilities are \nmasked by the non-Treg majority. Like CD4+ Treg cells, CD8+ Treg cells can be classified into \nnaturally occurring or induced. Among the naturally occurring , CD8+CD122+ Treg cells in mice \n(515, 516) and CD8+CXCR3+ in humans (517) can secrete IL10 and inhibit IFNG production. These \nsubsets were found work similarly to nTregs: they downregulate IL2R \u03b1 chain expression on target T INTRODUCTION \n \n 71 cells through CTLA4 and TGFB1, and make the target cells become unresponsive to IL2 (518). A \nsubset of CD8+CD25+ Tregs with FOXP3 expression has been recently described too (519). Induced \nCD8+ Treg cells also exist, including CD8+CD130+ Tregs involved in allograft tolerance (520), \nCD8+CD130+FOXP3+ Tregs expressing GITR and CTLA-4 (521), and CD8+CD25- Tregs able to \nsuppress antigen-specific and cytotoxic T cells (522, 523). Mathematical models applied to in vivo  \nexperiments (524, 525) suggested that CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells depend on interacting with \nCD8+ Tregs to modulate the proliferation of effector T cells (525).  \nNKT regulatory cells NKT cells have been regarded as effector cells  in immune-related diseases such as asthma \n(526), but they have also been shown to provide protection from graft versus host disease via an IL4 \ndependent mechanism (527). An in teraction between donor Tregs an d NKT cells to protect against \ngraft versus host disease has been described (528), and a reciprocal regulation has been documented \nwhere NKT cells modulate Treg function through IL2, and Treg cells suppress NKT cell \nproliferation and activity through direct cell cont act (529). A protective role of NKT cells in \nexperimental autoimmune encep halomyelitis has also been noted (530, 531), and a novel \nFOXP3\n+iNKT cell population described (532), which derive from iNKT cells activated in the \npresence of TGFB. Such cells, also  identified in humans, show mixed characteristics of nTregs and \niNKT cells: they express markers from both (CD25, CTLA4, GITR and CD103) and mediate \nsuppression of CD4+ effector T cells through GITR (532). Conversion of iNKT cells into \nFOXP3+iNKT cells, and their participation in oral to lerance, was also described in the TGFB-rich \ngut mucosa (532). All together these data lead to the thought that NKT regulatory cells participating \nin oral tolerance may have been misidentified as Th3 cells, in the absence of NKT cell marker \nverification (437, 477).  \n\u03b3\u03b4 T regulatory cells \n\u03b3\u03b4 T cells have been linked to epithelial regeneration (533) and seem to exert a regulatory \nfunction (534). Depletion of, or deficiency in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, aggravate inflammation in bowel \ninflammatory disease models (535, 536). K\u00fchl et al.  found \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with in vitro  regulatory \ncapacities similar to those of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells from human peripheral blood (537). This \n\u03b3\u03b4 T regulatory subset secretes IL10 and IFNG in amounts similar to nTreg cells, and produces \ngreater amounts of TGFB, althought neither IL2 secretion nor FOXP3 expr ession were detected \n(537). The latter matched previous experiments that failed to upregulate Foxp3  expression in \u03b3\u03b4 T \ncells upon activation in the presen ce of TGFB (532). Therefore, \u03b3\u03b4 T regulatory cells may exert their \nregulatory function through an IL2 independent mechanism, where IL10 secretion may stimulate The immune system \n 72other T cells to produce TGFB (538), which adds to the TGFB secreted by the \u03b3\u03b4 Tregs, and \naltogether generates a local immunomodulatory environment. A recent study attributed a regulatory \nrole to \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in certain asthmatic phenotypes (539). However, a new FOXP3+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset \nwith immunomodulatory properties was recently found in mice and humans (540). In this case, their \ndevelopment seemed to be TGFB and IL2 dependent (541).  \nB regulatory lymphocytes \nAt least in mice there is a B cell subset, activat ed through BCR, CD40 and/or TLR9, that exerts \na regulatory function similar to Treg cells and is involved in shaping effector T cell responses (542, \n543). The B regulatory (Breg) cells inhibit effector T cell responses through IL10, TGFB, or direct \ncontact (544). Among Breg subsets, B10 lymphocytes (545, 546) and CD1dhiCD5+ lymphocytes \n(547) are able to produce IL10. Recently, cell Ig domain and mucin domain protein 1 (TIM1) \nexpression has been reported as ne w marker for B10 lymphocytes (548). \nBregs play beneficial roles in diseases su ch as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus \nerythematosus, inflammatory Bowel disease and ex perimental allergic encephalomyelitis (549). \nHowever, other studies have pointed out that Breg cells may be a cause of deterioration in diseases \nsuch as type 1 diabetes, and rheumatoid and collagen-induced arthritis (550-552).  \nPlasticity in T regulatory cell lineage \nNowadays, regulatory activity is being regarded as a dynamic phenotype where the notion of \nregulatory T cells as static populations with a committed and stable regulatory activity is getting \nobsolete. Even nTregs are now seen as a dynamic population that depends on tissue environment for \nits regulatory function (430). Di fferent Treg and T effector phenotypes can switch capacities in vivo  \nand in vitro  depending on the cytokine environment. Regulatory FOXP3+ T cells in an autoimmune \nenvironment can re-methylate TSDR, lose Foxp3  expression, and became autoagresive by turning \ninto Th1 or Th17 effector phenotypes (429).  Th is is explained by the fact that Treg cells may \nexpress, together with FOXP3, transcription factors of different T effector phenotypes (IRF4, \nTBET). In a chronic inflammatory  environment, these \u201cdualistic\u201d Tregs can lose FOXP3 expression \nand turn into highly aggressive effector T cells that produce inflammatory cytokines and contribute \nto disease progression (199). FOXP3+ Treg cells immersed in an inflammatory context may also \nevolve to memory phenotypes (351). Surprisingly, FOXP3+ regulatory T cells may, under certain \nconditions, produce IL17 while retaining a regulatory phenotype (553, 554), or alternatively evolve \ntowards an effector Th17 phenotype depending on  IL6 signalling (555). Follicular B-helper T cell \ndifferentiation from FOXP3+ T cells has also been reported (556). Peripheral naive CD4+CD25- T \ncells can be shifted towards a CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ phenotype through stimulation in the presence INTRODUCTION \n \n 73 of TGFB and absence of IL6 and IL21 (384), or in the presence of IL4 and IL13 (557). The best \nunderstood mechanism to achieve CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells from peripheral naive CD4+CD25-T \ncells is the TGFB dependent pathway. Inhibitory SMAD7 protein is normally induced by TGFB and \nlimits TGFB production. Stimulation of naive CD4+CD25- T cells through their TCR in a TGFB \nrich environment increases TGFB pr oduction, which in turn induces Foxp3  transcription. Then \nFOXP3 strongly downregulates Smad7 , rendering the naive CD4+CD25- T cells highly susceptible \nto TGFB signalling via SMAD3/4 (558) (Figure 10). Vitamin A inhibits IL6 and induces TGFB \nproduction, favouring Treg di fferentiation and inhibiting the Th17 phenotype (559).  \n \n3.2. Inflammatory infiltrates and response in asthma \nThe lungs, as the organs for gas exchange, play a vital role in the maintenance of homeostatic \nbalances. This includes the regulation of pH and CO 2 partial pressure, and the supply of O 2 for \ntissue oxygenation and aerobic metabolism. But the lungs are also organs with an intense \nimmunologic activity, since they enclose our larg est surface in contact w ith the outside (75 m2 \napproximately) and ventilate about 15,000 L of air a daily. Moreover, it is estimated that they are \nexposed to more that 7 kg of pollution through the year.  \nThe study of asthma necessarily implicates a correlation with the immune response, which \nunderlies airway chronic inflammation, cardinal in asthma pathogenesis. Among the inflammatory \ncells involved, CD4+ T cells play a central role in orches trating chronic inflammation, and may be Figure 10. Conversion of naive \nCD4+CD25- T cells into iTreg \ncells in a TGFB rich \nenvironment.

But in a \nTGFB rich environment, \nS M A D 7  i s  n o t  a b l e  t o  \ndownregulate paracrine TGFB \nproduction, and the increase in the intracellular amount of \nTGFB induces Foxp3  \ntranscription.

To trigger an adaptive \nimmune response, CD4+ T cell activation by antigen presenting cells is required. Dendritic cells, the \nmain antigen presenting cells, form a network underlying the basement membrane of the respiratory \nepithelium, which is an optimal location to capture and scan inhaled airborne antigens. Dendritic \ncell density is higher in the upper airway (600-800 cells/mm2) and decreases towards the \nintrapulmonary airways, where it reaches approximately 75 cells/mm2 in most peripheral airways \n(562). Macromolecules that do not cross the tight-junction barrier formed by respiratory epithelial \ncells are captured and processed by dendritic cells. The dendritic cells then evolve to a mature phenotype and migrate to the peribronchial, hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and probably to \nnon-encapsulated lymphoid tissue as well, called bronchial associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). In \nthese locations, the dendritic cells present peptides from processed antigens to naive CD4\n+T cells, \nwhich in turn get activated with a Th2 phenotype (563). \nInnocuous antigens do not usually elicit a defensive immune response, but induce antigen-\nspecific tolerance instead. In asthma, conversely, CD4+ T cells are activated into a Th2 phenotype, \nsecrete IL4, IL5, and IL13, and inducing IgE synthesis by activat ed B-cells, eosin ophil recruitment \nand mucus production. Through IL9, Th2 cells also enhance mast-cell activity and further stimulate \nthe Th2 response (564, 565). All these Th2 pro- inflammatory cytokines map to the long arm of \nchromosome 5 in humans (566), and polymorphisms in this region are linked to the development of \natopy and airway hyperresponsiveness (567).  \nEosinophils are a major component of the infl ammatory infiltrates in  asthma (32, 154). \nEosinophils are recruited by Th2 cells through secretion of IL4, IL5 and IL13, and are important \nproducers of the fibrogenic cytokine IL13 (568). IL13 plays an important role in airway remodeling. \nIts expression is increased in th e lungs of asthmatic individuals with airway remodeling (569) and in \nmurine models of experimental asthma (570). This cytokine is also implicated in the development of \npulmonary fibrosis (571) and mucus hypersecretion (572). \nAside from typical Th2 driven inflammation, asthma may also present with neutrophilic \ninflammation, usually corticosteroid-refractory. In this context, Th1 and Th17 responses emerge and \nlead to IFNG and IL17 secretion respectively, and neutrophil recruitment to the airways. This form \nof asthma presentation may also combine with a Th2 response (573). Highly activated Th17 cells were found in bronchial biopsies of patients with asthma, and the increased levels of IL17  mRNA \ncorrelated with neutrophil numbers (574, 575). In turn, neutrophils may attract eosinophils to the \nfocus of inflammation and cause their degranulation (5 76). Recently, a new helper T cell subtype \ncalled Th17/Th2 has been described, which secretes IL17, IL4, IL5 and IL13 (577). It has been INTRODUCTION \n \n 75 suggested, in mouse models of allergic asthma, that lung recruitment of Th1 cells is a prerequisite \nfor Th2 cell recruitment (578). It is also known that, conversely, Th1 cells counteract Th2 cell-\nmediated responses. Adoptive transfer of OVA specific Th1 cells reverses Th2-derived IL4 \nproduction, BAL eosinophilia, and airway hyperresponsiveness in a mouse model of experimental \nasthma (579), although opposite results have also been reported (580). In fact, IFNG production has \nbeen shown to aggravate inflammato ry events in asthma (581). Theref ore, the role of Th1 cells in \nasthma is not clear overall. \niNKT cells also play a role in asthma, thought to  be relevant but still uncertain. iNKT cells were \nshown to be essential for the induction of Th2 a llergic responses, airway inflammation and airway \nhyperresponsiveness in mouse models of experimental asthma (582-584). Moreover, infiltrating \niNKT cells were also described in the bronchial mucosa of asthmatic patients (585, 586). \nAfter the identification of FOXP3 as the first Treg  cell marker in 2003 (411), an involvement of \nTreg cells in immune mediated diseases, incl uding asthma, has been suspected. IL6 receptor \nblockade leads to CD4+CD25+ T cell expansion and may impair Th17 differentiation (555), and \nsuppress airway inflammation (587). Treg involvement in asthma was also suspected from the \nclinical standpoint because it was noted that glucocorticoids induce FOXP3 expression and \nsuppressive effects in the BAL of treated  patients (588). Also, mutations in the FOXP3  locus in \nhumans and mice ( Foxp3 ) leads to immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked \nsyndrome (IPEX) and Scurfy syndromes, respectively (589). IPEX syndrome presents with \nincreased serum IgE, eczema and eosinophilia, also pr esent in allergic diseases, whereas the Scurfy \nphenotype is associated with a fatal lymphoprolifer ative disorder in mice. Studies in murine models \nshowed that Treg cells are involv ed in the mechanisms of tolerance induction (590, 591) and, in \nexperimental asthma, exogenous Treg cells appear to modulate asthma symptoms (592-594).  \nRegardless the extensive knowledge gained during recent years on immunoregulatory pathways \nand Treg cells, little evidence has been built on their role in asthma. Asthma disease mechanisms \nhave been largely studied on experimental asth ma models induced by i.p. sensitization in the \npresence of adjuvants, followed by airway antigen challenges. Although this approach reproduces \nmost asthma features, it does not reflect the way in which humans acquire allergic disease to \nairborne antigens, and related rhinitis or asthma. Since mucosal contact with the antigen may be essential for the innate immune system to operate, and interactions at this level may determine the \nsubsequent immune response, i.p. sensitization-based models may skip steps relevant to asthma \npathophysiology. Thus, animal models based on primary airway antigen exposure in the absence of \n\"vaccine-like\" sensitization may more closely re flect how allergic asth ma develops, and may The immune system \n 76involve immunoregulatory pathways othewise by-passe d in the classical i.p. sensitization models. In \naddition, the upper airway has been largely igno red in asthma studies. According to the current \nairway system integration theory, the upper airway as the primary si te of antigen exposure may play \nan important role in the development of lower airway disease and should be considered in the \nmodels. Therefore, in the work presented in this thesis we aimed at developing an integrated \nrhinitis/asthma model based on primary airway antigen exposure, and apply such model to the study \nof immunoregulatory mechanisms and the plausible involvement of Treg cells in the disease \nmechanisms. Furthermore, to attempt some translation of the experimental data to human asthma, we involved clinical research on bronchial biopsies. \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES \n \n HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES \n \n 79 Hypothesis \nThe pathophysiology of asthma may involve both effector and regulatory arms of the immune \nresponse. Classical experimental asthma models based on i.p. sensitization followed by airway \nchallenge may not fully reflect the immune response involved in actual asthma, where humans are \nsensitized to airborne allergens through primary exposure in the airways. The development of \nexperimental models based on primary airway antigen  exposure, and the integrated analysis of the \nupper and intrapulmonary airways in such models, may unveil immunoregulatory mechanisms \nrelevant to the disease.  \n \nObjectives \n1. To develop a murine asthma model induced by primary airway antigen exposure through i.n. \ninstillation of antigen or control, referenced  to a classical i.p. sensitization model. \na. To analyze airway hyperresponsiveness as a primary in vivo outcome, and profile its \ndevelopment and evolution through a time series of experiments.  \nb. To analyze other experimental asthma outco mes including airway inflammation, goblet \ncell hyperplasia, mucus production, subepithe lial fibrosis and airway contractile tissue \nmass. \nc. To analyze the presence and f unction of Treg cells as per Foxp3 , Il10 and Tgfb \nexpression. \nd. To develop an allergic rhinitis model for the integrated analysis of events in the upper \nand intrapulmonary airways.  \n2. To generate antigen-specific Treg cells, traceable  in vivo, by means of retroviral transduction \ninducing co-expression of Foxp3  and gfp. \na. To construct a gene transfer vector suitable for the retroviral transduction goal. \nb. To demonstrate the effects of adoptively transferred, antigen -specific Treg cells, versus \neffector CD4+ T cells, on experimental asthma. \nc. To titrate the minimum effective number of effector CD4+ T cells, to induce experimental \nasthma on adoptive transfer.  \n3. To obtain evidence on the presence of Treg cells in the airway wall of human asthmatics, by \nmeans of bronchial biopsy analysis. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMETHODS \n \n \n  \n METHODS \n 83  \n1. Animals \nAll study protocols were approved by the Comit\u00e9 \u00c9tico de Experimentaci\u00f3n Animal, Xunta de \nGalicia , in accordance with European Uni on Directive 86/609 and Royal Decree  1201/2005 of \nSpain. \nFemale BALB/c mice ( Mus musculus ) were purchased from Harlan Interfauna Ib\u00e9rica, S.L. \n(Barcelona, Spain) and maintained at the Unidad de Cirug\u00eda Experimental  (UCEX) of the Instituto \nde Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica de A Coru\u00f1a  (INIBIC). Animals were transported in approved cages \n(JAX\u00ae Mice Shipping Container, The Jackson Laboratory) with available food, and water supply by \nmeans of gelatinous wet packs. Upon arrival, the animals were inspected and then distributed in \ngroups of 2-3 animals into cages made of poly carbonate macrolon. The cages had a cleft for a 400-\nmL water feeding bottle and had top covers provid ed with polycarbonate filte rs (Ebeco, E. Becker \n& Co. GmbH, Germany).  The cages were placed in a ventilate d stainless steel rack (MIKROS-AS-\nD 48-2L), with a double positive/negative-pressure  filtration system (Ebeco, E. Becker & Co. \nGmbH). The animals were housed under controlled conditions, including periodic air changes (15-\n20 changes per hour), temperature and humidity within a constant range (21-24\u00baC and 40-55% \nrespectively), and a 12/12-hour lig ht/dark cycle. Following a 7-day adaptation period after arrival, \nthe animals were redistributed into groups of 4 to 5 mice and were fed ad libitum  with water and \nTeklad Global  maintenance feed, egg protein-free (Harlan Interfauna Ib\u00e9rica, S.L., Barcelona). The \nmice were aged 6 to 12 weeks when entered in the experiments. \n \n2. Study design \nWe developed protocols based on i.p. sensitization or, alternatively, direct primary allergen \nexposure in the airways through i.n. challenge, wi th the aim of establishing experimental asthma \nmodels that would allow us to investigate inm unoregulatory pathways. These models stemmed from \nprior reports (150, 164, 200, 595) and previous own experiece on Brown Norway rats (133). \nOVA or HDM were employed as allergens. Each model consisted of two groups: a control \ngroup challenged with PBS and an active disease group challenged with allergen. The immune \nresponse was induced by active sensitization or by adoptive transfer of T cells from donor animals. Mouse batches were assigned to the experimental groups through consecutive random sampling.  \nFour models of active sensitization, using OVA as an allergen, were developed with n=10 \nanimals per experimental condition (Figure 11). Thr ee of these models were based on direct primary \nallergen exposure in the airways: (i) short IN model (referred to as 3IN model here forth) consisting Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 84of 3 i.n. instillations; (ii) long IN model (10IN m odel) consisting of 10 i.n. instillations; and (iii) \nextended IN model (30IN model), with 30 i.n. instillations. The fourth model involved i.p. \nsensitization as per classical asthma modeling (IP m odel), where the animals were all i.p. sensitized \nto OVA and then challenged with PBS (control gr oup) or OVA. In this latter model, sensitization \nwas achieved by means of two i.p. injections separated by one week (days 0 and 7), and the animals \nwere then submitted to i.n. challenge starting one week after the second i.p. injection (day 14). For \nall models, i.n. instillations (PBS or OVA) were  administered three times per week (Monday, \nWednesday, and Friday) for a period  according to each specific model. \n \nFor experiments on adoptive transfer of effector CD4+ T cells, OVA was used for donor \nsensitization, in vitro T cell stimulation prior to tr ansfer, and airway challenge of the recipients. The \nfollowing experimental groups were included: (i) adoptive transfer of naive CD4+T cells from \nunsensitized donors, followed by plus 3 i.n. OVA ch allenges (n=6); (ii) ad optive transfer of OVA-\nFigure 11. OVA models.  Four murine models of experimental  asthma were developed, with their \nrespective controls challenged with PBS. White arrows : i.p. sensitization. Black arrows: i.n. exposure to \nOVA (or PBS in control groups). METHODS \n 85 stimulated CD4+ T cells plus 3 PBS i.n. challenges (n=12) ; and (iii, iv, v) adoptive transfer of \n25,000 (n=6), 50,000 (n=8) or 100,000 (n=12) stimulated CD4+ T cells, respectively, plus 3 OVA \ni.n. challenges. For airway antigen pre-load and in  order to facilitate recruitment of the transferred \nCD4+ T cells to the airways, two i.n. instillations we re administered to the recipients prior to cell \ntransfer, on the day before and just before cell injection (Figure 12).  \nAdoptive transfer was also empl oyed for a pilot experiment on Treg cells, on HDM-challenged \nanimals. In this case, two groups of mice were subm itted to i.n. instillations (28 instillations in total, \ndaily administered Monday  through Friday for a 37-day peri od), and adoptive cell transfer was \nperformed on day 31. The groups consisted of  HDM-challenged animals receiving 75,000 CD4+ T \ncells with forced expression of Foxp3  (n=4, see section 4 on genetic cell engineering below) or \nHDM- challenged animals receiving i. v. vehicle (n=4) (Figure 12).  \n \n \n3. Sensitization and challenge \nFor i.p. sensitization to OVA, the animals were  lightly anesthetized with 2% sevofluorane \n(Sevorane\u00ae, Abbot Laboratories, Madrid, Spain), inhaled in a Plexiglas chamber. On days 0 and 7, \n10 \u03bcg of OVA (Sigma-Aldrich, Sant Louis, USA) adsorbed in 50 mg of aluminum hydroxide \n(Imject\u00ae Alum, Pierce Laboratories, Rockford, USA) were i.p. in jected in a 100- \u03bcL PBS volume. \nFor all experimets using HDM, the allergen was standardized by Der p 1 content as previously Figure 12. Adoptive transfer models.  Two adoptive transfer models we re designed, to evaluate the \ninvolvement of effector CD4+ T cells (Teff) and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in experimental asthma.

(596). For i.p. sensitization to  HDM, the animals were lightly \nanesthetized as described above for OVA, and 0.12 \u03bcg of Der p 1 allergen (1.2 \u03bcL of HDM stok) \nadsorbed in 50 mg of aluminium hydroxide (Pie rce Laboratories) was i.p. injected in a 100 \u03bcL PBS \nvolume. \nIntranasal instillations were started on day 14 afte r first i.p. sensitization (day 0 in non i.p. \nsensitized models) and were administered under light anesthesia as described above. For each \ninstillation, 12.5 \u03bcL of a 6.66 \u03bcg/mL OVA solution in PBS, or PBS alone for controls, was \ndeposited per nostril using a micropipette. For HDM instillations, 12.5 \u03bcL of PBS containing 1 \u03bcg \nof HDM Der p 1 allergen (HDM extract, Greer In c., Lenoir, USA) was administered per nare.  \n \n4. Genetic cell engineering \nT cells for adoptive transfer were genetically m odified to induce expression of FOXP3, and/or \nGFP for in vivo tracking, as appropriate. The choi ce of gene transfer vector was determined by the \nneed of achieving strong and perm anent transgene expression in antig en- activated T cells as target \ncells. Since activated T cells undergo very fast cel l cycle, we expected simple plasmid transfection \nmethods originating episomes to lead to a loss of transgene expression upon target cell proliferation, \nand we therefore deemed such methods as not va lid for our purposes. Thus we chose commercially \navailable, replication-incompetent retroviral vectors, derived from murine oncoretroviruses. Such \nvectors are devoid of the env, gag and pol genes encoding the viral envelope and capsid proteins, \nand the retro-transcriptase, but preserve the n ecessary sequences for viral RNA encapsidation and \nfor retro-transcribed DNA integration into the ho st cell genome, and transgene expression. Such \nkept elements include the retroviral 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 long terminal repeats (LTRs), the packaging signal for \nRNA encapsidation and the tRNA binding site. Th ese retrovectors are issued as DNA plasmids \nprovided with a multiple cloning site (MCS) containi ng a variety of restriction sites, which allows \nthe user to insert the complementary DNA sequen ce (cDNA) encoding the product of interest. The \nplasmids are also provided with: a ColE1 origin  of replication for replication in prokaryote \ncompetent cells; an ampicillin resistance gene (encoding a \u03b2-lactamase) for the selection of \ntransformed bacteria, for vector DNA amplification; and a puromyci ne resistance gene that allows \nto select transfected cells for the preparation of packaging cell lines in eukaryotes.  \nTo produce virion particles for transfer to th e target cells, packaging cell lines expressing the \nenv, gag and pol structural genes were generated. The separate introduction and integration of the \nstructural genes into the pack aging cell line minimizes the chan ces of producing replication-\ncompetent viruses due to recombination events during cell proliferation. The resulting retroviruses METHODS \n 87 can infect target cells and indu ce permanent expression of the gene  of interest, but they cannot \nreplicate within these cells due to the absence of viral structural genes.  \nThe retroviruses employed are RNA viruses that require targ et cells to be under active \nproliferation in order to transduce the cells, that is , to integrate into the host cell genome leading to \npermanent transgene expression. Oncoretroviruse s take advantage of the absence of nuclear \nenvelope during target cell mitosis (metaphase and anaphase) to integrate the retro-transcribed viral \nDNA into the host DNA. This mechanism can be us ed to selectively transd uce proliferating cells \nwithin a cell population. In our experiments, we used this retrovirus property to selectively transduce antigen-specific CD4\n+ T cells. Following i.p. sensitization of the donor animals, \nsplenocytes comprising antigen-presen ting cells and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells are stimulated \nwith antigen in vitro, leading to pr oliferation of the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. By coupling \nantigen stimulation in vitro with retrovirus infection, only the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells are \ntransduced with high specificity.  \n4.1. Expression Vectors \nA Murine Stem Cell Virus (pMSCV) retroviral  expression vector (Clontech Inc., Saint-\nGermain-en-Laye, France) was used to  induce GFP expression on target CD4+ T cells. GFP, a 238-\naminoacid protein first ex tracted from jellyfish Aequorea victoria , exhibits bright green \nfluorescence when exposed to ultraviolet light. More efficient and spectrally shifted mutant \nisoforms have been designed or discovered, such as the AcGFP1 variant used in this work. The \ncDNA encoding GFP was amplified from a pAcGFP1 vector (Clontech Inc.) using sticky end \nprimers (Table 2, primers 01 and 02) and subcloned into the MCS of pMSCV between XhoI and \nEcoRI restriction sites. For all experiments, primers were designed and checked using TibMol tools \n(available at www.tib-molbiol.com ). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR)s were performed in a \nconventional thermocycler (Primus 96, Peqlab Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) using \nExpand High Fidelity PLUS PCR System (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) (see \nappendix). Restriction sites were checked and designed using Saccharomyces Genome Database \n(SCG) and New England BioLabs tools (available at http://www.yeastgenome.org  and \nhttp://www.neb.com/nebecomm/default.asp  respectively). Ligation reactions were performed using \nT4 DNA Ligase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Madrid, Spain) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. PCR products and plasmids were purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen \nGmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacture r\u2019s instructions. Reactions with restriction \nenzymes and alkaline phosphatase were performed as appropriate (enzymes purchased from Roche \nDiagnostics and used according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions).

(411) with minor modifications. Antigen-specific effector CD4\n+T cells were \ntransduced using a bicistronic construct containing Foxp3  cDNA plus gfp as a reporter, expressed \nunder the same promoter by means of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Foxp3  cDNA was \nkindly provided by Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi (Kyoto University, Japan). We used commercial \nbicistronic vector pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen1 (Clontech) to obtain the IRES sequence. In the final \nconstruct, Foxp3  was subcloned upstream the IRES, and its expression could be monitored from the \nGFP signal. ZsGreen fluorescent protein, a GFP variant present in the commercially available \npRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen1,  was not of interest for our purposes  because we had previously optimized \nimmunohistochemical GFP detection in tissues for the AcGFP1 variant (see section 8.6). To replace \nZsGreen  by AcGFP1  cDNA we performed inverse amplification of the pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen \nvector using primers 03 and 04 in Table 2 (with sticky ends for XhoI). We called the resulting \nvector, provided with a MCS upstream the IRES and the XhoI restriction site in frame downstream, \npRetroX-IRES-Y. The fragment encoding  GFP and puromycin resistance, from  the pMSCV-GFP \nvector, was amplified using primers with XhoI sticky ends (Table 2, primers 05 and 06), and METHODS \n 89 subcloned into the Y site. Correct insert orientation was checked by PCR (Table 2, primers 07 and \n08). Then, Foxp3  mRNA was amplified using primers with sticky ends for NotI and ClaI restriction \nenzimes (Table 2, primers 09 and 10), at the 3\u2019 an d 5\u2019 ends respectively. These restriction sites were \nthen used to insert the Foxp3  mRNA into the MCS, giving as a result the pRetroFOXP3-IRES-GFP \nvector. \n4.2. Virion particle production  \nThe pMSCV-GFP and pRetroFOXP3-IRES-GFP v ectors were separately replicated in \ncompetent DH5 \u03b1TM Escherichia coli  (Invitrogen) that became ampi cilin resistant due to the \nexpression of the ampicilin resistance gene presen t at the vectors. Transformed bacteria were \nselected with ampicillin in Petri dishes (Corning, New York, USA) using Luria Bertani agar (LBA) \nmedium (see appendix), and then cultured in liquid Luria Bertani (LB) medium (see appendix) at \n37\u00baC with gentle agitation. Plasmid DNA was extracted using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) \naccording to manufacturer\u2019s instru ctions. A HEK293T \"Phoenix\" ( \u03c6NX) ecotropic packaging cell \nline (Orbigen, San Diego, USA) was transf ected with pMSCV-GFP using Lipofectamine \n(LipofectamineTM 2000, Invitrogen) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. To generate a stable \npackaging cell line, transf ected Phoenix cells carrying plasmid in tegration events were selected by \npuromycin resistance using 2 \u00b5g/mL puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) (see appendix for a detailed \nprotocol). Surviving puromycin resistant cells were checked in a FacsCalibur cytometer (BD \nBiosciences, Madrid, Spain) for GFP expression, and then culture d and expanded. Cellular stocks \nwere frozen in culture media with 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich), and stored in liquid nitrogen for \nlater use. \nRetrovirus production was performed according to Phoenix cell provider\u2019s instructions: \ntransfected Phoenix cells were cultured and expanded using 60 mL of D-MEM culture medium with \n10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-s treptomycin-glutamine (PSG) (all from Gibco, \nInvitrogen) into 15 cm culture plates (Corning ). Once cells reached 95% confluence, culture \nmedium was changed by production medium, D-MEM plus 10% calf serum (Gibco, Invitrogen), \nand the cells were maintained for 24 hours. Cell culture supernatant was collected and filtered \nthrough 0.45 \u00b5m filter (Stericup, Millipore) and  maintained at 4\u00baC to maximize virion viability. \nVirion particles were concentrated by ce ntrifuging the supernatants in Centricon\u00a9 100.000 NMWL \nmembrane filters (Millipore) at 3500 g. Virion stocks were stored at -80\u00baC until use.  \nViral titers in the frozen stocks were estima ted using a murine NIH3T3 cell line (ATCC-LGC \nStandards partnership, USA). For this purpose, flow cytometry assays were performed in NIH3T3 \ncells after transduction with serial dilutions  of the pMSCV-GFP and pRetroFOXP3-IRES-GFP Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 90stocks. Additionally, a western blot assay was performed on pRetroFOXP3-IRES-GFP transduced \nNIH3T3 cells to check for Foxp3 expressi on. Antibodies agains t FOXP3, GFP, and \u03b1-tubulin were \nused, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody (see appendix for a detailed \nprotocol). \n4.3. Lymphocyte cell culture \nFor CD4+ T cell transduction and adoptive transfer ex periments, donor mice were i.p. sensitized \nto OVA or HDM as described (see section 3 on sensitization and challenge). One week after \nsensitization, the mice were euthanized and the spleens were removed in aseptic conditions and digested with collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich) during 60 minutes in a CO\n2 incubator (37\u00baC). Tissue \nwas disrupted using a 5 mL pipet, and the resulting cell suspension was passed through a 70 \u03bcm cell \nstrainer (Falcon, BD Biosciences) and collected in to 50-mL centrifuge tubes. Red blood cells were \nlysed using Red Blood Cell Lysing Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) according to manufacturer\u2019s \ninstructions. Splenocytes were cultured at 5x106 cells/mL in 6-well plates (Corning). To favor Th2 \ndifferentiation, cultures were supplemented with  10 ng/mL recombinant IL4 (PeproTech, Rocky \nHill, USA), 100 U/mL IL2 (BD Bioscience), 250 ng /mL anti-IL12 (eBioscience, Hatfield, UK), 2% \nnon essential aminoacids (Invitrogen) and 100 \u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoetanol  (Merck, Madrid, Spain). To \nstimulate antigen-specific CD4+ T  cells, 40 \u03bcg/mL OVA (for CD4+ effector T cell experiments) or \n8 ng/mL HDM extract derived Der p 1 (for CD4+Foxp3+ T cell experiments) were added as \nappropriate.  \n4.4. T cell retroviral infection \nAfter 24 hours of stimulation with antigen in vitro , the cells were infected with pSCMV-GFP or \npRetroFOXP3-IRES-GFP using a spin infection procedure. Viral supernatant was added to the \nsplenocyte cultures with 6 \u00b5g/mL polybrene (Sigma -Aldrich), at a multiplicity of infection (MOI, \nratio of infectious viral particles to cells) of 1. The cultures were then centrifuged at 455g for 1 hour \nat 37\u00baC. After centrifugation, the cells were returned to the cell culture incubator and maintained in \nstimulation medium for 7 days, and then sorted by FACS to separate the GFP-expressing cells for in \nvivo transfer. Cell sorting was done wi th BD Bioscience FacsAria equipment. \nAnalytic flow cytometry was performed to check FOXP3, cell surf ace markers (CD4, CD25) \nand/or GFP expression in transduced cells, usin g a BD Bioscience FacsScan cytometer. For this \npurpose, cells were resuspended in flow cytometry buffer (see appendix). PE-Conjugated Rat Anti-\nMouse CD4, allophycocyanin(APC)-conjugated Rat Anti-Mouse CD4 and PE-Conjugated Rat Anti-\nMouse CD25 antibodies (all from BD  Bioscience) were used for th e staining of cell surface antigens METHODS \n 91 at 0.8 \u03bcg/106 cells. For FOXP3 staining, APC-anti-mous e/rat FOXP3 Staining Kit (eBioscience) \nwas employed at 0.5 \u03bcg/106 cells.  \n \n5. T cell adoptive transfer experiments \nTo study the role of effector CD4+ T cells in experimental asthma, adoptive transferred \nexperiments were performed. Naive syngeneic recipient mice were transferred freshly harvested \nCD4+ T cells from unsensitized donors, or effector, antigen-specific CD4+T cells from sensitized \ndonors, the latter antigen-activated in vitro and transduced for GFP expression. Recipient mice \nreceived two prior i.n. instillations as stated (see section 2, Study Design). The cells were i.v. \ninjected in the tail of the recipients in 75 \u03bcL PBS vehicle. Sham challenged mice (PBS-instilled, \nn=5) received 105 stimulated GFP+/CD4+ T cells (control 1). One group of OVA-challenged animals \n(n=5) received 105 non-transduced, non-activated T cells (c ontrol 2). Lastly, three groups (n=5 \neach) received 0.25 x105, 0.5x105 and 105 antigen-specific, activated, GFP+/CD4+ T cells and were \nsubsequently challenged with OVA (Figure 13). \n \nTo study the role of Treg cells in experiment al asthma, two groups of mice (n=4 per group) \nwere i.n.-challenged with HDM as depicted (S ection 2, Study Design). One group of animals \nFigure 13.  Adoptive \ntransfer of T cells. \nCTRL1 group was \ninstilled with PBS and \nreceived 1x105 activated \nGFP+ T cells. CTRL2 \ngroup was instilled with \nOVA and received 1x105 \nnon-activated, non-\ntrasduced fresh T cells. \nThe three experimental \ngroups (EXP 0.25X105; \nEXP 0.5x105; and 1x105) \nwere instilled with OVA \nand received 2.5X104, \n5x104, and 1x105 \nactivated, GFP+ T cells, \nrespectively. Adoptive \ncell transfer was \nperformed i.v. on day 2 \nafter the first i.n. \ninstillation. Animals were \neuthanized on day 10 \nafter first instillation. A \nB Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 92received 75,000 antigen-specific CD4+FOXP3+ T cells. The cells were i.v. injected in the tail as \ndescribed for effector T cells (Figure 14). \n \n \n6. Lung function \nInvasive lung function measurements were performed by forced oscillation technique under \nmechanical ventilation, using FlexiVent equipment (SciReq, Montreal, Canada; purchased from \nEMMS, London, UK).  \n6.1. Measurement of airway  hyperresponsiveness \nIncreasing MCh ( Acethyl-\u03b2-Methyl-Choline Cholride , Sigma-Aldrich) concentrations (Table 3) \nin filtered PBS were administered to mechanically ventilated animals by means of an Aeroneb\u00aeLab \nultrasonic nebulizer (Aerogen, Galway, Ireland) coupled to th e FlexiVent inspiratory line.  \n6.2. Preparation of animals for mechanical ventilation \nFigure 15 depicts the setup for mouse mechanical ventilation and lung function testing. \n6.2.1.  Anaesthesia  \nMice were weighed before sedation and this valu e was introduced into the FlexiVent software \nfor automatic adjustment of total lung capacity (TLC) and tidal volume.  \n \n Figure 14. Adoptive tr anfer of Treg cells.  A group of mice received 28 i.n. instillations with HDM to \nstablish an experimental asthma model driven by primary HDM airway exposure in the absence of \nprevious sensitization. An alternative HDM -instilled group was i.v.-injected with 7.5x104 GFP+ Treg \ncells on the day of instillation 24, to evaluate the immunoregulatory properties of these cells on \nestablished disease in vivo.  \nMETHODS \n 93 Table 3.

Deep anaesthesia was reached by increasing sevoflurane to 3%, and verified by the \nloss of the palpebral and toe-pinch reflexes.  \n6.2.2.  Tracheostomy \nThe trachea was surgically exposed, and an incision between two upper-third tracheal rings was \nmade to insert the cannula (FTC100 Tracheal Cannula, \u00d8 0.2 mm, EMMS). The cannula was then \nfixed with surgical silk to the trachea to avoid decannulation during animal manipulation.  \n6.2.3.  Neuromuscular blockade and connection to the mechanical ventilator \nA 0.15 mL volume of 0.5 mg/mL rocuronium (Esmeron\u00ae, Organon, Holland) was i.p. injected \nto abrogate spontaneous breathing. The animal was then quickly connected to the FlexiVent through \nthe tracheal cannula and was kept anaesthetized by continuous sevoflurane inhalation through the \nventilator inspiratory line. Ventilator settins used were 200-250 breaths/min respiratory rate, a tidal \nvolume of approximately 0,14 mL (body weight-adjus ted for each individual animal) and a PEEP of \n2 cm H 2O. Optimal settings for mouse mechanical ventilation are shown in Table 4. Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 94 The mouse mechanical ventilation module of \nthe FlexiVent is provided with a piston ( a) \ncontrolled by a high-precision linear motor ( b). \nThe piston drives preset air volumes through \nthe inspiratory arm ( c) and to the tracheal \ncannula ( d). Increasing MCh doses are \nadministrated through an ultrasonic nebulizer \n(e). Expired air is drawn through the expiratory \narrm, provided with a PEEP water trap ( f), and \nthen released through the exhaut. \nThe FlexiVent equipment \ncomprises a computer with \nproprietary software (a) that \ncontrols the mechanical \nventilation module (b), collects \nthe signals from the pressure \ntransducers and calculates values \nfor pulmonary function \nvariables. Interchangeable \nventilation modules exist for \nanimals of various sizes (mice, \nrat, guinea pig). The animals are usually connected to the \nventilator through tracheostomy, \nsuch as the mouse shown inside \nthe orange square. The panels at \nthe bottom show the \na b\nc d e f \nThe trachea is separated from \nsurrounding tissues, and the \ncannula is inserted and fixed \nwith surgical silk. a \nb\nAn incision is \nmade in the upper \nthird of the neck \nOnce the cannula is fixed, the \nanimal is quickly connected to \nthe ventilator. \nFigure 15.

Measurement of pulmonary  function variables \nPulmonary function variables were measured under mechanical ventilation by forced oscillation \ntechnique, using a single-compartment mathematical  model as issued by the FlexiVent software \n(FlexiVent 5.2). For data collection, tidal-volume mechanical ventilation was transiently interrupted \nand pressure prime waves (\"perturbations\") were ge nerated by the ventilator. Pulmonary resistance \n(RL), measured from 20-second \"snap-shot\" primewaves , was the primary variable analyzed, as an \nindicator of airway responsiveness to increasi ng MCh doses. Pulmonary elastance and the model's \ncoefficient of determination were monitored to discard R L increases due to airway plugging, and for \noverall data quality. Once the anaesthetized animal was connected to the ventilator and the \nventilation parameters adjusted as appropriate, tidal-volume ventilation was carried out until \npulmonary function values were stable (this would usually take 1-2 minutes). Then a R L baseline \nvalue was averaged from a series of several prime waves. After R L baseline reading, the MCh \nnebulization protocol was performed starting with PBS and finishing with the maximum MCh \nconcentration (see MCh concentrations on  Table 3). For each nebulization, 25 \u03bcL of PBS or MCh \nsolution was deposited into the nebulizer cup and passed through 20 seconds to the tidal volume-\nventilated animal. After each nebulization was finished, prime waves and data collection were \nperformed every 10 seconds for 3-4 minutes. A valid peak R L value was taken as the response R L to Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 96each nebulization. The respective MCh doses were stepwise administered every 4 minutes until \nfinishing the protocol. The airway responsiveness profile was presented as the curve generated from \nthe successive peak R L values obtained after the corresponding MCh doses. Airway \nhyperresponsiveness was considered when R L was significantly higher than baseline R L at 10 \nmg/mL MCh or earlier, and significantly higher than control R L for the same MCh dose.  \nTo avoid artifact data due to the formation of atelectases during mechanical ventilation, a total \nlung capacity (TLC) manoeuvre or \u201csigh\u201d was admi nistered as necessary. During this manoeuvre, \nthe ventilator distends the lungs up to a 300 mmH 2O pressure, which usually uncollapses the lung \nparenchyma and/or plugged airways (597). \n \n7. Euthanasia and specimen collection procedures \n7.1. Euthanasia \nOnce the lung function data collection protocol was completed, a bolus of 0.2 mL heparin \n(Sodium heparin 1000 IU/mL, MAYNE PHARMA S.L., Madrid, Spain) was i.v. injected to avoid \npost-mortem blood clotting. Then, 0.3 to 0.5 mL of potassium chloride (14.9% w/v, BRAUN, \nMelsungen, Germany) was i.v. administered in th e tail to induce cardiac arrest in the deeply \nanaesthetized animal.  \n7.2. Bronchoalveolar lavage \nBAL was collected for total and differential leukoc yte counts, and to store samples of its fluid \nfraction for further analysis. For this purpose, 1 mL of PBS was introduced into the lungs using a \nsyringe connected to the tracheal cannula. The PBS was then slowly retrieved, which allowed for a \napproximate 0.7 mL fluid recovery. This BAL fraction was introduced in a conic polypropylene \ntube (Falcon) and plunged on ice until processing. A second BAL fraction was obtained using a \nthree-way stopcock (Discofix\u00ae C, Braun) connected to  the tracheal cannula, a PBS-filled syringe, \nand a collection syringe.  Four mL of PBS was introduced into the lungs in 1-mL steps, and each \nmL was sequentially recovered and pooled into a clean centrifuge tube. The first BAL fraction was \ncentrifuged at 458 \u22c5g for 5 minutes, and its supernatant aliquoted into 2-mL low protein adherence \ntubes ( Protein LoBind , Eppendorf Ib\u00e9rica, Madrid, Spain) a nd stored at -80 \u00baC. The cell pellet was \nresuspended and pooled into the second BAL fraction, which was then centrifuged. The supernatant \nwas discarded and the cell pellet, comprising the to tal cells from the first and second BAL fractions, \nwas resuspended in 1 mL of PBS. From this suspension, total cell counts were done under the \nmicroscope using a Neubauer chamber (ZUZI Co rp., France), and cell viability was checked by \ntripan blue dye (Gibco, Invitrogen) exclusion. Cell concentration was then adjusted to 400,000 METHODS \n 97 viable cells per mL, and cytocentr ifuged specimens containing 60 ,000 cells were prepared for \ndifferential leukocyte counts as follows: 150 \u03bcL of the adjusted cell suspen sion was placed into each \nof several cytocentrifuge cones (U niversal 32, Hettich, Tuttlingen, Germany) mounted on adherent \nmicroscope slides (SuperFrost\u00ae Plus, Menzel-Gl\u00e4ser, Braunschweig, Germany), and centrifuged at \n28\u22c5g for 6 minutes in the proprietary \"cytospin\"centrifuge. The slides were then allowed to dry at \nroom temperature for 20 minutes, and were fixed in  methanol (Panreac, Barcelona, Spain) for 10 \nminutes. After fixation, the slides were again dried at room temperature for 20 minutes, and stored \nat -20\u00baC for later staining. \n7.3. Lungs \nA mid-sagittal incision was done in the abdomen through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, \nmuscular plane, and parietal peritoneum, using a scalpel. Once the abdominal cavity was exposed, \nthe bowels were separated to expo se the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta on the posterior \nabdominal wall. Then, the diaphragm muscle was cut using blunt scissors, taking care to not \ndamage the lungs. After pulmonary collapse by diaphragmatic incision, the chest was opened \nthrough a mid-sternal line up to the neck tracheotomy. The abdominal cava-aorta bundle was cut \nand the right ventricle was punctured with a syringe and needle to perfuse the pulmonary vascular \ncircuit with PBS before lung extraction. After perf usion, the lungs were excised in bloc from the \nthoracic cavity, along with the can nulated tracheobronchial tree and heart. The lungs were then \ninflated at 25 cmH 2O standardized pressure by connecting the tracheal cannula to a recirculation \npump with 4% formaldehyde (Panreac) in PBS for 20 hours, for normalized quantitative \nmorphology. After fixation, lung sagittal slices we re introduced into histological casettes, immersed \nin 70% ethanol (Panreac) and placed into a caro usel tissue processor (STP 120 Spin Tissue \nProcessor, Thermo Scientific, Madrid, Spain) over night, with a paraffin inclusion program detailed \non Table 5. Once processed, the specimens were blocked in paraffin and cut with a microtome \n(RM2155, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Four- \u03bcm tissue sections were laid onto \nadherent microscopy slides (SuperFrost\u00ae Plus, Menzel-Gl\u00e4ser) for subsequent staining procedures. \n \n \n \n \n Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 98Table 5.

Skulls \nHeads were sectioned at cerebellomedullary cister n level to separate the skull from the spine, \nand the skin, eyes, brain and lower jaw were excised.  The skulls were immersed in formalin and the \nair contained in the nose was purged by introducing formalin through the epipharynx with a blunt \nneedle. This procedure elim inated the air trapped in the upper ai rway to ensure correct fixation of \nthe nasal cavity structures (266). The skulls were fixed for 20 hours and then immersed into a \ndecalcifying solution (SHANDON TBD-1\nTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 5 hours. After \ndecalcification, frontal slices of the nasal cavity were cut with a scalpel in standardized anatomic \nlocations, according to the Young protocol establis hed in rats (266) and later adapted for mice by \nFarraj et al.  (263). We processed the samples as per Farraj with minor modifications. A proximal \ncut was done behind the incisisor t eeth, middle cut at the first palatal ridge, and distal cut at the 3rd \npalatal ridge (Figure 16). \n METHODS \n 99  \n8. Histological staining and sp ecific detection procedures \nSpecimens were submitted to a variety of histological stains, immunohistochemistry and nucleic \nacid hybridization procedures for analysis (figrures 17 and 18). Wright-Giemsa staining was done \nfor leucocyte differential counts on BAL cytocentrifuged slides. For general histopathological \nassessment, and to identify eosinophils in inflamma tory infiltrates in the lungs or nasal sections, \nhaematoxylin-eosine staining (H-E) was employed. To identify mucus-producing cells in the \nairways, such as goblet cells, periodic acid-Sc hiff (PAS) stain was used. Masson trichrome stain \nwas performed for the analysis of extracellular matrix deposition. Contractile airway tissue was \ndetected by immunohistochemistry using an antibody to alpha smooth muscle actin ( \u03b1-SMA). In \nadoptive transfer experiments,  GFP-expressing cells were localized in the tissues by \nimmunohistochemical GFP detection. Where appropriate, in situ  hybridization was performed to \nidentify Foxp3 , Il10, and Tgfb  mRNAs in lung cells. \n8.1. Wright-Giemsa \nThis technique, first described by Romanowsky in 1902, is broadly used to stain cell smears . It \nis based on eosin and azure colorant-releasing de rivates (azure A, B and methylene azure). Eosin \nacts as an anionic cytoplasmatic colorant, staini ng extracellular components  and certain acidophil \nstructures, while azure cationic derivates stain basophilic structures, like chromatin.  \nCytocentrifuged BAL samples were retrieved from -20\u00baC storage, defrosted at room \ntemperature for 30 minutes and introduced into acid alcohol (37% hydrochloric acid in 96\u00ba ethanol, \nPanreac). They were then staine d with Wright solution (Gurr\u00ae, VWR, Barcelona, Spain) for 10 \nFigure 16. Nasal cavity in mouse.

After filtration to \ndiscard precipitates, the samples were stained with commercial Giemsa solution (Merck) for 30 \nminutes, and then differentiated into glacial acetic  acid (Panreac) to get a regular colored tone. \nFinally, the samples were passed through 96\u00ba ethanol (taking care to not to decolor them \nexcessively), 100\u00ba ethanol and xylene (Panreac) , and were mounted with DePex mounting medium \n(Gurr\u00ae, VWR) \n \nFigure 17. Especimen collection and analysis procedures. Lung function was evaluated using \nFelxiVent ventilator and then BAL was collected fo r total and/or differentia l cell counts. Upper and \nlower airways were collected, formaldehyde fixed and paraffine embebeded. Haematoxylin-eosin (H-\nE), PAS, Masson thricrome, \u03b1-actin immunohisto chemistry (IHC), FISH and/or GFP+ IHC were \nperformed as required. \nLUNG FUNCTION (FlexiVent) \n\u2212 Histopathology assesment (H-E) \n\u2212 Mucous substances (PAS) \n\u2212 Subepithelial fibrosis (Masson) \n\u2212 MCT (\u03b1-actin IHC) \n\u2212 mRNA expression (FISH) \n\u2212 GFP+ cell detection (GFP IHC) Total/differential cell count in BAL \n(Wright-Giemsa) METHODS \n 101  \n8.2. Haematoxylin-eosin \nHaematoxylin is a vegetable colorant, extracted from the heartwood of the logwood tree \n(Haematoxylum campechianum ). When oxidized, haemat oxylin acquires a dark purple color. It is \nbasic or cationic and therefore is used to st ain acidic cellular compon ents, like the nucleus. \nHaematoxylin has a limited capacity to remain in the tissues and must be combined with metallic \nions (iron salts or aluminum) that act as mordant.  Eosin is an acidic fluores cein derivative that gives \na dark pink color and is used to stain basic cellu lar components, mostly present in the cytoplasm. \nFour-\u03bcm tissue sections were deparaffined by placing them into a heater at 60\u00baC for 30 minutes \nand immediately immersing them in xylene baths until all paraffin was removed. The samples were \nthen rehydrated through 100\u00ba ethanol, 96\u00ba ethanol, distilled water and tap water with 1 \u2030 HCl \n(Merck); the iron contained in tap water favo urs haematoxylin fixation to the tissues. After \nrehydration, the samples were immersed into Harrys\u2019 Haematoxylin (Panreac) for 5 minutes and \nthen washed several times in tap water to attenuate the excess colorant. The samples were then \nimmersed into an eosin solution (see appendix) for 5 minutes and then dehydrated in 96\u00ba, 100\u00ba \nethanol and xylene, and mounted with DePex mounting medium. \n \nFigure 18. Histological staining techniques.  We used several staining techni ques to analyze histological \nsamples derived from the animals of the study. This  figure shows histological sections stained using \nhaematoxylin-eosin ( A), periodic acid Schiff ( B), Masson thricrome ( C), immunofluorescence for a-sma \n(D) and GFP ( E) and in situ hybridization for Foxp3  (F), Tgfb, and Il10 mRNA. Scale bars: A, B, and C \n50 \u00b5m; D, 100 \u00b5m; E, 10 \u00b5m; and F, 25 \u00b5m. Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 102 8.3. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) \nMucopolysaccharides are the main  mucus components and are substances rich in hexoses and \nacetylated or sulfonated acids. The PAS staining technique is based on its ability to break the links \nof the hexose ring and expose aldehyde groups, which are then bound by the Schiff reactive. This \nreactive is a fuchsine derivate that produces leuco- sulfonic acid, a colorless unstable compound, that \nbecomes purple-violet when it binds the aldehyde groups and loses its sulphuric acid. Thus, PAS-\npositive substances stain from intense pink to violet. \nFour-\u03bcm tissue sections were deparaffined and rehydr ated as described, except for the use of tap \nwater. The samples were then immersed in peri odic acid solution (see appendix) for 10 minutes, \nwashed in tap water, and placed in Schiff reactive (M erck) in the dark for 30 minutes. After that, the \nslides were immersed in sodium bisulfite (Sig ma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes, and washed with tap \nwater again. The sections were then placed in Ha rrys\u2019 haematoxylin for 10 minutes and washed in \ntap water. Finally, the samples were dehydrated and mounted with DePex. \n8.4. Masson\u2019s trichrome \nCollagen fibers are the most ab undant component of conjunctive tissues and are derived from \nprocollagen secretion by several cell types, such as  fibroblasts. The main function of collagen is to \nprovide resistance and physical su pport to tissue structures. There are several types of collagen, \nbeing I and IV the types mostly found in subep ithelial fibrosis and those detected by Masson's \ntrichrome staining. This staining technique is based on the use of acid fuchsine to stain conjunctive \ntissue and Weigert\u2019s ferric haemat oxylin to stain the cell nuclei. \nFour-\u03bcm tissue sections were deparaffined and rehydrated as described, ending in tap water . \nThe slides were then immersed in ferric aluminum aqueous solution (Merck) for 20 minutes (ferric \nalum acts as a mordant, favoring subsequent haematoxylin staining), and salt debris was then \nremoved by washing the slides in tap water. The samples were then stained with Weigert\u2019s ferric \nhaematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes and washed again in tap water until getting a dark-\ngrey tissue color. Next step was incubation in picr ic acid (Panreac) for about 6 minutes (time varied \ndepending on reactive maturation), to favor acidy for subsequent staining with fuchsine. After \nincubation, the slides were washed in tap water un til they became yellow, a co lor shift attributed to \nthe picric acid. The samples were then i mmersed in Ponceau\u2019s fuchsine (Certistain\u00ae, Merck) for 8 \nminutes and washed twice with 1% phosphomolybdic acid (Merck) solution in distilled water for 5 \nminutes. Collagen was then stained with with aniline blue (Merck) for 12 minutes. The slides were \nfinally washed several times in distilled water, dehydrated through 96\u00ba and 100\u00ba ethanol and xylene, \nand mounted in DePex.  METHODS \n 103 8.5. Alpha-smooth muscle acti n immunohistochemistry  \nAlpha-SMA is the predominant actin isoform in the contractile apparatus of smooth muscle \ncells, and is also present in myofibroblasts. \nFour-\u03bcm tissue sections, deparaffined and rehydrated, were subjected to cell membrane \npermeabilization with 0.2 % Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 20 minutes and then blocked \nwith a universal blocking solution (Image-iTTM Signal Enhancer; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) for \n30 minutes with the aim of reducing tissue autofluorescence. Mouse anti- \u03b1-SMA IgG2a monoclonal \nantibody (clone 1A4, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as primary antibody (1:100 dilution), followed by Alexa Fluor\n\u00ae 488 labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) as detection system as per \nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions, in PBS with 20% goat serum (Vector Labs, Peterborough, UK) and \n0,1% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich) as diluent. Nuclear counterstaining was done with DAPI \n(SelectFXTM Nuclear Labeling Kit, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). The stained specimens were then \nfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) to favor longer Alexa fluorochrome stability, and \nmounted a permanent medium optimized for fluorescence microscopy (ProLong\u00ae Gold, antifade \nreagent; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). \n8.6. Green fluorescent protein immunohistochemistry \nThe native fluorescent signal of GFP and its variants, although appropriate for flow cytometry, \nis usually not reliably detectable in fixed tissue sections. Indirect GFP detection by \nimmunohistochemistry allows to overcome this limitation and provides a highly specific, amplified \nsignal.  \nFour-\u03bcm lung sections were deparaffined, rehydrat ed and permeabilized as described, blocked \nwith Mouse-on-Mouse blocking reagent (Vector Labs), and incubated with mouse anti-GFP \nmonoclonal antibody JL-8 (Clontech). The primary antibody was followed by a biotinylated horse \nanti-mouse secondary antibody, an avidin-biotin-a lkaline phosphatase complex, and development \nwith Vector Red chromogen (all from Vector Labs).  Cell nuclei were counterstained with methyl \ngreen solution (Sigma-Aldrich; see appendix for recipe). The specimens were then dehydrated and \nmounted in DePex. \n8.7. Fluorescence In-situ hybridization (FISH)  \nThe FISH thecnique employs labeled DNA or R NA strands, complementary to a specific DNA or \nRNA squence to be localized in tissue sections. In this work, FISH was performed on lung sections \nusing digoxigenin or biotin-labeled DNA probes, followed by fluorescently labeled antibodies to \ndetect the hybridized probes.

In-situ hybridization design \nThirty-five-nucleotide probes against Foxp3 , Tgfb and Il10 mRNA sequences were designed \naiming at the same melting temperature (Tm) and GC content. Once the theoretical probes \nsequences were generated using National Center fo r Biotechnology Information resources (available \non-line at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and TIB mo l resources (available on-line at www.tib-\nmolbiol.com), potential intra-probe dimer and hairpin formation, as well as heterodimer formation \nbetween probes, were checked using Primer3web software (598). No other mRNA homologues \nwere found in mouse or rat using a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST software, provided METHODS \n 105 online by the National Institutes of Health, USA) . One, two and three probes, complementary to \ndifferent sequences, were tested for Foxp3 , Il10, and Tgfb mRNAs (Table 6, probes 12 \u2013 17), \nrespectively. The probes were labeled by adding a 3\u2019 tail with digoxigenin or biotin-bound \nnucleotides (Roche oligonucleotide tailing kit, Roche Diagnostics). A poli-T probe was used as a \npositive control (Table 6, probe 11) and probes without an annealing sequence were used as \nnegative controls (Table 6, probes 18 \u2013 26).  \n8.7.2.  Fluorescence in situ hybridization protocol \nLung sections of 7- \u03bcm thickness were cut and laid onto silanized slides (Dako, Glostrup, \nDenmark). The sections were kept at 37\u00ba C overnig ht, deparaffined with xylene (10 and 2 minutes, \ntwice into each bath), rehydrated through ethanol 100\u00ba (twice), 90\u00ba, 70\u00ba, 50\u00ba and water (1 minute \neach), and dried at 37\u00ba C for 10 minutes. Proteina se K (Enzo Life Sciemces, Farmingdale, USA) \npretreatment was applied at 1:30 dilution for 15 min at 37\u00ba C, and the slides were then washed twice \nwith PBS using gentle agitation for 1 min. Th e specimens were then acetylated using 0.1 M \ntriethanolamine buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.25% acetic anhidre (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min, and \nthen washed twice in PBS. Afte r acetylation treatment, the tissues  were dehydrated from water \nthrough 50\u00ba, 70\u00ba and 100\u00ba ethanol (1 min each), and then allowed to dry at room temperature for 10 \nmin. The samples were then prehybridized with hy bridization buffer (Enzo Life Science) at 37\u00ba C \nfor 20 min and then washed in preheated PBS. The specimens were  then immediately covered with \nhybridization buffer containing the probes at 100 ng/mL, had a coverslip (Sigma-Aldrich) applied, \nand were incubated at 37\u00ba C for 1 hour. After the hybridization step, the specimens were washed \nwith 1x and 0.2x saline-sodium citrate preheated buffers (Sigma-A ldrich) for 10 min, and twice \nwith PBS at room temperature. For the detection step, a permeabilizing treatment using 0.2% Triton \n(Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 20 min was applied,  followed by two PBS washes (5 min each). A \nblocking step was performed with 0,1% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich), 5% bovine serum albumin \n(Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 30 min. Sheep anti-digoxigenin (Roche) and goat anti-biotin (Sigma-\nAldrich) were used as primary antibodies (at 1: 100 dilution according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol) \ndiluted in 2,5% bovine serum albumin and 0,2% Tween-20 in PBS. After a one-hour incubation, the \nslides were washed twice in PBS at room temper ature and incubated for 30 min with donkey anti-\nsheep and anti-goat fluorescently-labeled second ary antibodies (Alexa 647 and 594 respectively, \nInvitrogen) at 5 \u03bcg/\u03bcL, in 5% mouse serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0,2% Tween-20 in PBS. Two PBS \nwashes were done at room temperature followed by a 2-min incubation with DAPI (1:300). The \nsamples were then washed three times in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Sigma) for \n15 min and mounted with ProLong\u00ae Gold mounting media (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen).  Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 106 8.7.3.  FISH quantification \nHybridized samples were analyzed in a fluorescence microscope and Foxp3+, Il10+ and Tgfb+ \ncells were quantified in at least 10 randomly samp led zones containing inflammatory infiltrates per \nanimal. \n8.8. FOXP3 immunostaining on human bronchial biopsies \nBronchial biopsies were collect ed in a multicenter fashion, from the following groups of \nsubjects: (i) severe asthmatics (n=29); and (ii) control bronchial mucosa group (bronchial biopsies \nfrom disease-free areas as per endoscopic examin ation, from subjects undergoing diagnostic \nprocedures for focal lung disease such as lung nodule or investigation of hemoptysis; n=5). The \nprotocol was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the participating centers, and all subjects \nsigned inform consent. The biopsy specimens were  provided by: Dr. Vicente Plaza Moral and Dr. \nAlfons Torrego Fern\u00e1ndez (Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona); Dr. Carlos Mart\u00ednez \nRivera (Hospital Universitario Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona-Barcelona); Dr. Antol\u00edn L\u00f3pez \nVi\u00f1a (Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Madrid); Dr. Santiago Bardag\u00ed Fons (Hospital de \nMatar\u00f3, Matar\u00f3-Barcelona); Dr. Francisco Javier  Gonz\u00e1lez Barcala (Complexo Hospitalario de \nPontevedra, Pontevedra); Dra. Teresa Baz\u00fas Gon z\u00e1lez (Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, \nOviedo); Dr. Patrick Berger (Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux 2, Burdeos, France); and Dr. James G. Martin \n(McGill University, Montreal, Canada). The biopsi es were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (10% PBS-\nbuffered \"formalin\") for 24 hours (during overnight shipment from collaborating centers as needed), \nand paraffin embedded as described for mouse specimens. For analysis, 4- \u03bcm tissue sections were \ndeparaffined, passed through an antigen retrieval step (PTLink, Dako), and processed for \nimmunostaining in an AutostainerLink 48 (D ako). Mouse anti-human FOXP3 antibody (Abcam) \nwas used as primary antibody at 1:100 dilutio n, followed by Envision Flex Mouse linker, \nHorseradish phosphatase and DAB st aining kit (all from Dako) for detection. The tissue sections \nwere counterstained with haematoxylin, and mounted in permanent medium. For quantitative \nmorphology, the FOXP3+ cell counts were referenced to the biopsy surface area, measured with \nImageJ software. A surgical tonsil specimen was used as a positive staining control. \n \n9. Quantitative morphology \nImages from lung sections were acquired w ith an automated fluorescence microscope \n(BX61/BX62, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital camera (DP70, Olympus), and using \n10x, 20x and 40x objectives depending on airway size so as to obtain the biggest possible airway \nsize within one image. Cross-sectioned airways were analyzed according to established sampling METHODS \n 107 and standardization criteria (599). Airway cell co unts and surface areas re sulting from extracellular \nmatrix and contractile tissue measurements were referenced to the basement membrane perimeter \nsquared (P BM2), which is considered a constant airway size reference independently from the airway \ncontraction or relaxation status (599). Quantitative measurements in the upper airway were based on \nprior methods (263, 266). Nasal samples in OVA-challenged mice and controls were examined to \ndetermine the area most sensitive to changes in the amount of PAS-positive epithelial substances, \nwhich resulted to be the proximal section of the nasal cavity, whereas no differences were observed \nin the middle and distal nasal sections. Within the proximal nasal section, the main differences were found in the mid septum, maxiloturbinates, and do rsal wall, which were the areas consequently \nselected for quantitative data acquisition from  PAS color extraction. Eosinophils and PAS\n+ cells \nwere counted through the entire length of the nasa l epithelium in the proximal sections. Cell counts \n(eosinophils and goblet cells) were normalized by the basement membrane length squared and \nexpressed as cells/mm2, while stored mucosubstances, extracellular matrix, and \u03b1-SMA+ contractile \ntissue section surface areas were expressed as dimensionless indices.  \nImage processing for quantitative morphology was performed with AnalySISD\u00a9 (Soft Imaging \nSystem, Olympus) and ImageJ (v.1.43m, National In stitutes of Health, USA) software. The digital \nimages acquired from the microscope were calib rated using a standard micrometric ruler slide \n(Leica Microsystems). A digital scroll tablet (Trust, Dordrecht, Holland) was used to outline the \nbasement membrane for its measurement in intrapulmonary airways and upper airway sections, and \nto define regions of interest for the quantification of airway wall structures. To measure collagen \ndeposition and epithelial mucosubstances, the Mass on's trichrome blue com ponent and PAS staining \nboundaries were respectively delimited by a colour extraction algorithm and measured as particle \nsurface areas. For each cross-sectione d intrapulmonary airway  or upper airway section, the particle \nsurface area summation was divided by P BM2 or the basement membrane length squared, and the \nresult was named \u201cextracellular matrix mass\u201d or \u201cmucoid mass\u201d, respectively. For airway \ncontractile tissue quantification, the \u03b1-SMA immunofluorescent signal was digitally thresholded and \nextracted, measured as particle surface area summation divided by P BM2 , and named \"airway \ncontractile tissue mass\u201d. \n \n10. Data analysis \nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 16.0) software, and graphics were \ngererated using SigmaPlot (version 2000). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean \n(SEM) unless otherwise specified. Group comparis ons were analyzed with  one-way analysis of Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 108 variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher\u2019s least sign ificant difference (LSD ) or Games-Howell post-\nhoc tests as appropriate. Intra-group MCh r eactivity curve analysis was done with ANOVA \nfollowed by Dunnett post-hoc test (multiple comparisons versus baseline R L). F values of less than \n0.05 were considered significant.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRESULTS \n \n RESULTS \n 111 1. Pathophysiology of experimental asthma in a murine model of primary airway allergen \nexposure; differences verus i.p. sensitization.  \nExperimental asthma modeling in animals has largely been based, since its inception, on \nvaccine-like antigen sensitization, i.e. sensitizati on based on i.p. or subc utaneous injection of \nallergen with an adjuvant, followed by airway an tigen challenge. Such sensitization procedures lead \nto allergic responses in the upper and lower airw ays after antigen challenge, and airway remodeling \nupon repeated challenge. However, this strategy does not represent human sensitization to airborne \nallergens, and relevant immune pathways, such as those involved in immunoregulation, may be \nskipped in such models. To explore the response to primary allergic sensitization in the airways, we \ncompared classical i.p. sensitization (IP model) w ith primary allergen exposure in the airways in the \nabsence of adjuvants (3IN, 10IN and 30IN models as detailed in Methods, Section 2), the latter \nresembling the way in which sensitization to airborne allergens naturally occurs in humans.  \n \n1.1. Primary allergen exposure in the upper aiway elicits an at tenuated pulmonary \nresponse with long-term decline. \nIn the IP model, the OVA-challenged animals developed frank airway hyperresponsiveness, as \nreflected by a signifi cantly increased R L (p<0,05 versus control group) on the 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/mL \nMCh doses (Figure 19-C and Table S1 in appendix). In the 10IN model, where the time span from \nthe first exposure of the immune system to the allergen was similar to the IP model, the OVA-\nchallenged animals developed and attenuated R L response with borderline significant R L increases \n(p=0,078 at 10 mg/mL MCh) (Figure 19-B and Table S1 in appendix). To profile a timeline for the \nattenuated airway responsiveness observed upon primary allergen exposure in the airways, we \ndeveloped and analyzed the 3IN and 30IN models. In the 3IN model, the R L curve of the OVA-\nchallenged animals largely overlaid that of the controls (Figure 19-A and Table S1 in appendix). In \nthe 30IN model the R L curve was flattened in closeness to th e control animals, although the limited \nRL increase reached statistical significance versus control ( P <0.05) at 10 mg/mL MCh do to tight \ndistribution variability (Figure 19-D and Table S1 in  appendix). These data showed that primary \nallergen exposure of the upper airway induces attenuated airway hyperresponsiveness, which \nreaches a plateau by week 10 after first exposure,  and fades if i.n. antigen exposure continues. Intranasal vs. intraperitoneal sensitization model \n 112  Figure 19. Airway responsiveness to MCh.  The R L response to MCh challenge was tested upon \ncompletion of the i.n. instillation protoc ols. The OVA-challenged animals showed: ( A) no R L response in \nthe 3IN model; ( B) a bordelline significant R L increase in the 10IN model,  as opposed to established \nairway hyperresponsiveness in the IP model ( C); and ( D) declined airway responsiveness in the 30IN \nmodel. \u2020: P=0,08; *: P<0,05. \nRESULTS \n 113  \nFigure 20.

Eosinophilic inflammation follows a consistent trend with airway \nhyperresponsiveness in the lung but not in the upper airway. \nTotal BAL cell counts were significantly increas ed in the OVA-challenged mice in all models, \nwith a progressive gradient in the IN models (Figure 20-A). Among the control groups, a small but \nsignificant increase was observed in the 30IN group. In BAL differential counts (Figure 19-B,C and \ntables S2 and S3 in appendix), the eosinophil numbers in the OVA-challenged animals showed a \ntrend consistent with the airway responsiveness da ta. In the IP model, the OVA-challenged animals \nshowed strong eosinophilic inflammation in the BA L, whereas the OVA-challenged animals in the \n3IN, 10IN and 30IN models showed attenuated eo sinophilic infiltration. These animals in the IN \nmodels showed, conversely, increased lymphocytic infiltration in the BAL, compared with the IP \nmodel. \nIn lung tissue sections, the OVA-challenged anim als showed strong airway inflammation in the \nIP model, and attenuated inflammatory infiltr ates in the 10IN and 30IN models. The OVA-\nchallenged animals were devoid of airway inflam mation in the 3IN model, as were control animals \nin all models (Figure 21). Eosinophil numbers in th e airway wall, corrected by airway size, showed \na trend consistent with the BAL eosinophil data  in the OVA-challenged animals (Figure 21-E and \nTable S4 in appendix). In nose tissue secti ons, the OVA-challenged an imals showed increased \neosinophils in the IP, 10IN and 30IN models. Differently from the lungs, the nasal eosinophilic \ninflammatory infiltration increased progressively from the 3IN to the 30IN model, where it reached \nan intensity similar to the IP model (Figure 22 and Table S5 in appendix). Control animals showed a \nbaseline presence of eosinophils in the nose, in a ll models, where the 10IN control group showed a \nhigher presence of eosinophils compared with the co ntrol groups in the 3IN and 30IN models \n(Figure 22E and Table S5 in appendix). \n \n1.3. Primary antigen airway exposure induces an early mucoid response in the upper and \nlower airways. \nWith the aim of studying the muco id secretory response and goblet  cell hyperplasia in the nose \nand lungs, as a feature of tissue remodeling in asthma and allergic rhinitis, tissue sections were \nstained with PAS techniqu e. The number of PAS+ cells and the load of intraepitelially stored mucus \nin the respiratory epithelium were quantitatively assessed in the upper and lower airways. The \nOVA-challenged groups showed a significant incr ease in stored intraepithelial mucus and goblet \ncell numbers the airways, with the highest values a ttained in the IP model (Figure 23 and tables S6 \nand S7 in appendix).

The increased mucous load was more patent \nin the 10IN model, although attenuated in comparison  with the IP model, and declined in the 30IN \nmodel. Regarding the nasal cavity and as stated in the methods section, we found that the proximal \nzone, particularly the septum, was the most sensitive area to changes induced by allergen challenge. \nAll OVA exposed groups showed a significant mucoid response in this area of the nasal cavity \n(Figure 24 and tables S8 and S9 in appendix). Such response was already patent at the early stage as \nseen in the 3IN model, showing a greater response than in the lungs.

Role of effector and regulatory T cells in ex perimental asthma: effector versus regulatory \narms. \nClassical experimental asthma models, based on i.p. or subcutaneous sensitization to antigen \nwith adjuvants, have played a major role to understand the adaptive immune response that underlies \nallergic asthma and the role that effector CD4+ T cells play in it. However, such models may by-\npass T cell-driven regulatory pathways that are present in actual asthma where primary allergen \nexposure occurs in the airways. The results from the IN models presented here show that primary, \nsustained antigen exposure in the airways leads to an overall attenuation of asthma features and to a \nshift from an eosinophilic to a predominantly lymphocytic inflamma tory profile, and suggest that \nIL10 and TGFB secreting Tregs may be involved in these effects. On the next section, we aimed at \ndemonstrating the role of effector CD4+ T cells and FOXP3+CD4+ Treg cells. For this purpose, we \nperformed T cell adoptive transfer experiments in ex perimental asthma with sole antigen exposure \nin the airways. \n \n2.1. Generation of an tigen-specific CD4+T cells \nTo study the role of the effector T cells in experimental asthma we generated antigen-specific \nCD4+ T cells in vitro, with forced GFP expression for subsequent tracking in vivo. With the aim of \nto obtain lymphocytes with forced GFP expression, gfp c DNA was subcloned in the MCS of the \ncommercial pMSCV expression vector (Figure 28-A,C) between XhoI (5\u2019) and EcorRI (3\u2019) \nrestriction sites, resulting in the pMSCV-GFP vect or (Figure 28-B). The correct insertion of the gfp \ncDNA was checked by digesting pMSCV-GFP with XhoI and EcoRI restriction enzymes, which \nliberated the gfp cDNA (Figure 28-D). \n Splenocytes from OVA-sensitized donors were  expanded and transduced in vitro with \npMSCV-GFP virions under OVA stimulation (see section 4 in methods). This resulted in antigen-\nspecifc CD4+ T cells with forced GFP expression that were purified by cell sorting and used for \nadoptive transfer to unsensiticed recipients. A titr ation was performed to infer the minimum number \nof effector CD4+ T cells able to induce experimental asthma features. Adoptive transfer models \n 124  \n2.2. Adoptive transfer of antigen-specific effe ctor T cells to unsensitized recipients \ninduces lung inflammation after 3 i.n. instillations. \nFourty-eight hours after the first i.n. instillation, the group  that received 1x105 OVA-specific \nAcGFP+/CD4+ T cells and were OVA-challenged showed airway hyperresponsiveness, determined \nas per a significant R L increase at [10 mg/mL] MCh compared  with PBS-instilled mice (control 1) \nor with mice that received non- activated T cells and were i.n.

These cells co-expressed GFP for subsequent tracking in the \nrecipient animals. For this purpos es we used a bicistronic vector with two open reading frames \nseparated by an IRES sequence, with one common promoter that drives co-expression of the two \nsubcloned cDNAs. Due to our preferred use of the AcGFP1 GFP variant, the bicistronic expression \nvector pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen (Figure 33-A), as commercially provided, was amplified to \neliminate the ZsGreen  cDNA encoding ZsGreen GFP variant (Figure 33-C, and methods section). \nTo track the transduced cells, a cDNA encoding AcGfp1  and puromycin resistance (\" puro \") (Figure \n33-D) was subcloned in place of ZsGreen , resulting in a construct that  we term pRetroX-IRES-GFP \nA B C \nE \nFigure 31.

Many hypotheses generated from clinical \nobservation in patients can be explored using experimental models, and the data from such models \ncan often be translated to the human setting. Animal models play as well a crucial role in the \npreclinical development of new drugs by the ph armaceutical industry. There is a variety of \npublications in the literature where different animal species have been used to model asthma (55, \n117, 133, 154, 164, 204, 208, 600). The animal most often employed is the mouse, due to its low \ncost and easy handling, but also due to the similarities seen between murine experimental asthma and actual human asthma. In fact, it is possible to reproduce human asthma features in the mouse, \nsuch as: the adaptive immune response agains t allergens, orchestrated by effector CD4\n+ T cells with \na Th2 activation phenotype; airway inflammatory  infiltration involving ly mphocytes, eosinophils \nand mast cells; structural airway wall alterati ons reflecting airway remodeling; and airway \nhyperresponsiveness leading to airflow obstruction upon nonspecific airway challenge. The latter is \nconsidered the functional correlate of airway inflammation and remodeling, and is a cardinal human \nasthma feature (149, 160, 601, 602). However, animal models have limitations to be considered \nwhen interpreting the data in the human disease translation context. In most studies reported on \nanimal asthma models, the experimental disease was induced by allergic sensitization through one \nor more i.p. or subcutaneous injections containing the allergen and an adjuvant, then followed by \nairway antigen challenges. Ther efore, such models involve a vaccine-like sensitization stage \nfollowed by secondary airway an tigen exposure, an approach that does not truly represent how \nairway allergic disease is acquired in humans. Su ch an approach, devoid of any involvement of the \nrespiratory epithelia during primary antigen exposure, may indeed skip relevant immunoregulatory \npathways involved in the mechanisms of tolerance and allergic responses.  \nIn the work presented in this thesis, we aimed at studying the role of immune regulation \nemploying experimental asthma models based on primary antigen exposure in the airways, in the \nabsence of prior subcutaneous or i.p. sensitization, to better represent the natural acquisition and \ndevelopment of airway allergic disease to perennial airborne allergens through models \nencompassing all immunological pathways involved in the disease, both effector and regulatory. For \nthis purpose, the animals were airway-exposed to antigen or control through continued protocols, without a defined distinction be tween a sensitization phase and secondary exposure. Because OVA \nhas been generally used as an allergen to model asthma in animals (55, 133, 164, 200-202, 263, \n603-607), and with the purpose of referencing our data from primary airway antigen exposure \nmodeling to a classical i.p.-sensitization model (600), we adhered to the use of OVA in our i.n. Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 140 instillation models despite the limitation and certain  criticism that OVA is not an actual airborne \nallergen related to human airway disease (608). We chose i.n. instillation as the procedure for \nairway allergen exposure based on previous studies by us (600), and others who reported that \nantigens administered by i.n. in stillation reach the intrat horacic airways and ar e deposited into the \nlungs (151, 200). Other approaches for airway allergen exposure have been less used and present \npractical inconveniences or limited lung deposition. Antigen delivery through orotracheal intubation \nor tracheotomy requires general anesthesia, and surgery in the latter case. Such methods are \ncontroversial as a repeated procedure on the same animal due to the invasive intervention required. Another approach is the exposure of awake animals to allergen nebulized into a chamber, which \nresults in poor deposition in the airways and facilita tes bowel allergen exposure, partly indirectly \nthrough skin deposition and licking, which may induce immune tolerance. In fact, the inhalation of \naerosolized OVA in an exposure chamber has been used as a model of antigen tolerance induction \n(609, 610). Conversely, i.n. OVA instillations lead to IgE-mediated airway inflammation by week 5 \nafter primary exposure in the A/ J mouse (263). In order to profile the timeline of the immune \nresponse and associated experimental disease driven  by i.n. instillation, we developed the 3IN, 10IN \nand 30IN models. The 3IN model was aimed at providing a minimum or no-response reference, \nwithin an early time window wher e an adaptive immune response l eading to IgE-mediated airway \ninflammation could not yet be developed. It is widely accepted that the time elapsed from the first \ncontact of the immune system with an immunizing antigen to the attainment of a primary adaptive \nimmune response is about 7 days (611). Therefore, the response if any observed in the 3IN model \nshall be attributable to the innate immune system. The 10IN model cutoff was chosen as the time \npoint where the time elapsed from the first contact with the antigen was equivalent to the time span \nof the comparator model, the IP model, from the first i.p. injection for sensitization to the last i.n. \nchallenge. Finally, the results obtained in the in 10IN model led us to develop the 30IN model, to \nrepresent extended chronicity and analyze whether th e experimental asthma features elicited in the \n10IN model would worsen, plateau or decline.  \nWe chose R\nL responsiveness to MCh, an in vivo lung function output sensitive to airway \nhyperresponsiveness, as the primary outcome to evaluate the development of experimental disease \nthrough the 3IN, 10IN and 30IN models. The inhalation of nebulized MCh, an acetylcholine-analogue cholinergic agent (68), stimulates muscarinic receptors in the airway smooth muscle and \ninduces smooth muscle contraction, which in turn increases R\nL. In animals with experimental \nasthma, R L increases significantly through progressive MCh doses in comparison with control \nanimals. Testing R L responsiveness to MCh under mechanical ventilation in experimantal animals DISCUSSION \n 141 serves indeed as a close analogue to spirometric testing of airway hyperresponsiveness in humans. \nIn the experiments presented in this thesis, the OVA-challenged animals of the IP model showed a \nsteep, significant R L increase versus the control group, i.e. frank airway hyperresponsiveness, \nconsistent with the established features of this immunization-driven model. In the 3IN model, the R L \nresponse profile of the OVA-challenged mice closely followed that of the control group, an \nexpected outcome in the absence of an adaptive immune response and dependent IgE and effector T \ncell-driven inflammatory mechan isms. In the 10IN model, the OVA-challenged animals yielded \nreduced R L increases in comparis on with the frank hyperresponsiveness seen in the IP model. The \nRL response was in this case limited to borderline statistical significance versus the control group. \nThus we interpreted this result as an attenuation but not complete blunting of airway \nhyperresponsiveness, attributable to regulatory mechanisms only elicited by primary antigen \nexposure in the airways. Such  regulatory mechanisms likely ar ose from \u201cnatural\u201d exposure to \nairborne antigen, in close interplay with the e ffector pathways driving airway inflammation and \nhyperresponsiveness, and were bypassed in the classical IP model. In view of the 10IN model data, \nwe enquired whether the attenuated airway response would fully develop into consolidated airway \nhyperresponsiveness should airway antigen challenge continue for a prolongued period. This was \ntested in the 30IN model where, conversely, the R L response in the OVA-challenged animals \ndeclined and closely approached the control group such as in the 3IN model. In summary, primary \nallergen exposure in the airways led to limited, bo rderline airway hyperrespo nsiveness that declined \nupon sustained airway antigen challenge. Control groups showed R L increments, significant versus \nintra-group baseline R L at the highest MCh doses, which re flects physiologic airway reactivity to \ninhaled cholinergic agonist as also seen in clinical MCh testing on healthy subjects. \nAirway inflammation was evaluated by tota l and differential BA L cell counts, and \nhistopathological examination of lung tissue sections with quantitative morphology to determine the \nnumbers of eosinophils infiltrating the airway wall. All OVA-challenged groups had significantly \nincreased BAL total cell counts versus their re spective control groups. Control groups were \nhomogeneous across the IP, 3IN and 10IN models, whereas the 30IN control groups showed a \nmodest but significant increase in total BAL cells, attributable to nonspecific leukocyte recruitment \nthrough a 70-day long i.n. instillation regime. Such  BAL cell increase in the 30IN control group was \ndue to lymphocyte influx, as show n by the differential counts. Alth ough without an im pact on total \nBAL cells, the control group of the IP model show ed increased eosinophils compared with the IN \ncontrol groups, attributable to background systemic Th2 activity. The OVA-challenged group in the \nIP model showed robust eosinophilic inflammation co nsistent with previous reports (55, 154, 164, Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 142 600), reflected in the BAL differential counts and quantitative morphology data. The IN models \nshowed attenuated eosinophil infiltration in the OVA-challenged animals, with a trend paralleling \nthe R L response, best reflected in the airway wa ll counts as per quantitative morphology. It is \nnoteworthy that the 3IN model showed a limited bu t significant eosinophil influx in the airways. \nSuch eosinophil increment is unlikely to have occu rred through IL5 released  by activated Th2 cells \nor IgE-mediated mastocyte degranulation. Innate immune system pathways, perhaps involving \nalternative mastocyte activation, may have accoun ted for the eosinophil response in the 3IN model \n(612). Contrary to the attenuation of eosinophilic infiltration, the IN models showed a relevant \nincrease of lymphocytres in the ai rways, quantitatively de monstrated in the BA L differential counts \nand consistently observed on examination of lu ng tissue sections. In su mmary, prim ary antigen \nexposure in the airways elicited attenuated ai rway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, and \nshifted cell infiltrates from  eosinophilic to a predomin antly lymphocytic pattern. \nAirway mucus production was analyzed by go blet cell counts and PAS color extraction \n(mucoid mass), with both approaches yielding equivalent results. All OVA-challenged groups \nshowed significantly incr eased mucus production versus their re spective control groups. In the 3IN \nmodel, the OVA-challenged group showed a consid erable increment of muco id mass in the lungs, \nregardless the brief i.n. instillation period. Goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus overproduction are \ncharacteristic changes of the lower and upper airways in asthma and allergic rhinitis, respectively. \nIn asthma, the degree of mucus secr etion contributes to disease severity and its substrate, goblet cell \nhyperplasia, is considered an airway remodeling feature (49, 51, 52, 54, 60, 613-615). The \nmechanisms that induce these changes in asthma are poorly understood, but animal models have \npointed at cytokines such as IL9 and IL13 as imp licated (53-55). The invo lvement of IL13, a major \ncytokine produced by activated Th2 lymphocytes, links the adaptive immune response to mucus \nhyper-production. However, the presence of significant goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus \noverproduction in the airways of OVA-challenged mice in the 3IN model suggest that this early \nresponse, which occurred ahead of the necessary time to mount an adaptive immune response, may \nbe driven by in innate immunity mechanisms during the process of allergic disease induction. In the \nnasal mucosa, OVA exposure induced goblet cell hyperplasia and increased mucoid mass, the \ngreater the longer exposure in the IN models. The nasal septum region was the most sensitive to such changes. Overall, the data suggest that the mucoid response to antigen exposure is initiated \nbefore the specific adaptive immune response develops, an idea that links the innate immune system \nwith the early induction of one of the components of airway remodeling, as is mucus \noverproduction. The mucoid response in the nose seems indeed independent from lower airway DISCUSSION \n 143 eosinophil infiltration and the overall lung response, because the IN models showed a progressive \nincrease in mucus production, particularly reflect ed in the mucoid mass m easurements, despite the \ntendency to a decline of eosinophilic infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia in the lungs. Therefore, \nthe mucosal responses to allergen exposure may be differentially regulated in the upper airway and \nthe intrapulmonary airways. \nSubepithelial fibrosis is a relevant feature of airway remodeling in asthma. We measured \ncollagen deposition in the lungs by Masson's trichrome staining and digital color extraction analysis. \nThe OVA-challenged mice in the 10IN and 30IN m odels showed significantly increased collagen \ndeposition in the lamina propria of the intrapulmona ry airways. Conversely, there was no significant \nincrease in the IP and 3IN models. In both cases, th e absence of subepithelial fibrosis is attributable \nto the short airway antigen exposur e, particularly in the IP model. Since prolonged airway challenge \nof sensitized animals led to increased collagen depo sition in a prior IP model (600), the data suggest \nthat subepithelial fibrosis is associated with chronicity and may be driven by the adaptive immune \nresponse.  \nIncreased airway smooth muscle, at the expense of both hyperplasia and hypertrophy, is \nconsidered central to the mechan ism of airway hyperresponsiveness and airflow obstruction (26, 27, \n61). The smooth muscle increment also correlates with disease se verity (561, 616). The increased \nthickness of the airway smooth muscle layer is in fact the airway remodeling feature on which most \nattention has been focused, and for which the largest data body has been generated. Mechanisms \nproposed for the growth of airway smooth muscle in asthma include: (i) in situ proliferation, at least \nin part induced by the proximity of mastocytes (62) or by direct T cell contact (133, 561); (ii) the \nmigration and differentiation of fibroblasts or dedifferentiated smooth muscle cells (65, 617); and \nthe recruitment and differentiation of fibrocytes, a circulating, bone marrow-derived progenitor cell \n(618, 619). Changes in myocyte contractile proper ties may also contribute to the mechanism of \nairway hyperresponsiveness (66). In addition, airway smooth muscle cells have the capacity to \nswitch between a contractile and a secretory pheno type, and may release inflammatory mediators \nsuch as IL6, IL8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulting factor (620, 621). In this work, we \nanalysed airway smooth muscle remodeling in respons e to primary airway alle rgen exposure in the \nIN models, versus the IP model. We employed \u03b1-SMA detection, the most extensively used \nprocedure to label airway smooth muscle since the commercially available 1A1 monoclonal \nantibody shows excellent performance on tissue sections under virtually any type of fixation \nincluding formalin, on virtually an y vertebrate species including r odents, horse and human. Because \nmyofibroblasts may also express \u03b1-SMA, the more inclusive term \"airway contractile tissue mass\" Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 144 was coined (595) to refer to \u03b1-SMA-based detection of the airw ay contractile apparatus, which \nlargely coincides with histologically defined airway smooth muscle bundles. The analysis of airway \ncontractile tissue mass in the IP model demonstrated a large increments of airway contractile tissue \nmass regardless the shortness of the airway challenge period, whereas the IN models showed \nattenuated growth that reached statistical significance in the 30IN model only. In these models, \nthere was therefore a dissociation between the trend of airway hyperresponsiveness and that of the \nairway contractile tissue growth.  \nAnother objective in the series of experiments presented here was to study an integrated rhinitis and asthma model. In human disease there is strong evidence for a connection between rhinitis and \nasthma. Allergic rhinitis is in fact considered a risk factor to develop asthma, and vice versa (622-\n624). This epidemiological relationship is probabl y a consequence of subjacent mechanisms linking \nupper and lower airway inflammation in the context of a global airway invo lvement in the immune \nresponses. However, there are few or no works that have integrated the study of the upper and lower \nairways within the same experimental disease mode l. The establishment of an integrated model as \ndescribed here may provide a useful tool for the study of the mechanisms of allergic sensitization \nand immune regulation, and has the potential to shed light on aspects such as  the increase in asthma \nprevalence and the validation of new therapeutic or preventive strategies. To study the model \nresponse in terms of allergic rhinitis, we anal yzed sections comprising the nasal cavity and \nparanasal sinuses, of which only the nasal mucosa was sensitive to changes, particularly in the \nseptal region. The OVA-exposed group of the IP model showed strong eosinophilic inflammatory \ninfiltration. In the IN m odels, there was a gradient of eosinoph il infiltration from non-significant in \nthe 3IN model to maximum in the 30IN model. Therefore, the intensity of eosinophilic \ninflammation in the nose, a surrogate measure of allergic rhinitis in this study, was associated with \nthe length of i.n. antigen exposure. Such progressive increase of eosinophilic inflammation in the \nnasal mucosa, paralleled by stepwise increasing mucoid mass, sharply contrasted with the trend of \nboth eosinophilic inflammation and mucus load in the lungs, which were downregulated after \nplateauing in the 10IN model. Thus, the data generated from modeling primary allergen exposure in \nthe airways suggest that the features of allergic rhinitis, wh ich increase according to allergen \nexposure, are not responsive to regulatory mechanisms elicited in the lung. Interestingly, the nasal mucosa showed a baseline presence of eosinoph ils in all control groups, not seen in the \nintrapulmonary airways. Such eosinophil baseline fl uctuated and peaked at the 10IN control group, \nto return to bottom line in the 30IN model. Although there is no direct explanation for this, we \nspeculate that the baseline presence of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa is relevant to its DISCUSSION \n 145 physiological functions, and is responsive to non-specific stimuli in a regulated fashion. The nose is \nin fact an organ subjected to intense sampling of  antigens and non-protein chemicals, and our data \nsupport that core immune system decisions on responsiveness or tolerance may occur at this level. \nThe differences seen between the IP and IN models also strengthen the idea that the primary site of \nantigen exposure plays a fundamental role in determining the choice of a subsequent immune \nresponse. Upon i.p. sensitization, the direct entry of  a foreing antigen into a body cavity definitely \nescapes immunoregulatory pathways that reside in  the mucosal systems, yet the responses arising \nfrom primary exposure on a mucosal system, such as the respiratory tract, seem regionally regulated. The latter is reflected in our data by the different response patterns elicited in the nasal \nmucosa versus intrapulmonary airways, in the IN models. The 3IN, 10IN and 30IN model series \nmay be interpreted as an allergic disease histor y where rhinitis and asthma develop concomitantly, \nyet events leading to progressive inflammation and mucus production in the nose activate regulatory \npathways that limit the peak intensity of the asthma features (at 10IN versus the IP model), and \neventually downregulate intrapulmonary airway inflammation and mucus load upon continuing \nallergen exposure. Our data are therefore consiste nt with the epidemiologi cal association between \nallergic rhinitis and asthma, yet challenge the simplis tic theory that encloses both disorders together \nunder the \"one airway, one disease\" concept (238, 241). The relationship between both disorders is \nin fact subjected to a great variability of natural disease history in humans. Inhaled exposure to \nairborne antigens may lead to allergic inflammation in the whole respiratory tract, with a varying \nsequence of the clinical rhinitis and asthma manife stations in naturally acquired human disease, yet \nour data are consistent with diffe rentially regulated responses in the nose and lungs rather than a \nphysiopathologically homogeneous airway.  \nGiven the data suggesting that immunoregulatory mechanisms acted in the intrapulmonary \nairways to attenuate experimental asthma in th e IN models, and the time sequence of the events \nobserved, we hypothesized an involvement of Treg  cells. We therefore aime d at demonstrating the \npresence of Treg-mediated immune regulation in the lungs, trigered upon primary airway allergen \nexposure. Due to the diversity of regulatory T cell subpopulations under ongoing description, and \nthe absence of a definite marker or panel of markers to identify such cells, we abode with the \nFOXP3 transcription factor and IL10 and TGFB cytokines, as best defined markers (397, 411, 433, 482) suitable for in situ detection on fixed tissu e sections. Because of limitations of commercially \navailable antibodies to detect these targets on formalin-fixed mouse ti ssues, we analyzed the \nexpression of Foxp3 , Il10 and Tgfb m R N A  b y  F I S H  a n d  w e  l i m i t ed the technique to the OVA-\nchallenged groups of the four models. The 3IN OVA group, devoid of signs of an established Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 146 adaptive immune response, acted as a comparator for the 10IN and 30IN OVA groups, and we \nanalyzed the presence of transcri pts in the lymphoid cells of the inflammatory infiltrates. We found \nthat, in the lungs of the IN models, the numbers of Foxp3 , Il10 and Tgfb mRNA+ lymphoid cells \nincreased progressively as the experimental as thma features declined. That is, there was a \nprogressive presence of lymphoid cells with signs of Treg activity that correlated with the \ndevelopment of a tolerant state. Interestingly, the OVA animals of the IP model, which showed the \nstrongest airway hyperresponsiveness and inflamma tory infiltration, showed an outstanding high \nlevel of Foxp3  mRNA+ cells, not accompanied by concordant levels of Il10 and Tgfb transcription. \nThis suggests that, in the OVA animals of the IP model, there is a reactive induction of Foxp3+ cells \nalthough most of them may not be functional. Whether a post-transcriptional impairment of FOXP3 \ntranslation or functionality underlie s this finding, and why those ly mphoid cells still transcribing \nIl10 and/or Tgfb do not effectively bring down the experi mental asthma features as in the IN \nmodels, remain open questions.  \nIn summary, the data from the IN model series versus the IP model show that primary antigen \nexposure in the airways leads to allergic rhinitis that progresses through the antigen exposure \nperiod, and attenuated asthma that declines on continuing antigen challenge. The modulation of the \nasthma features is associated with increasing numbers of lymphoid cells expressing  Foxp3 , Il10 and \nTgfb transcripts in the lung inflammatory infiltrat es, which suggests the establishment of a Treg-\ndriven immunoregulatory setting in the lungs. The diverging findings in the IP model suggest that \nthe interaction of the antigen with the airway mucosa  is essential for the development of an effective \nimmunoregulatory arm. The activation of Treg cells may be driven by signals of the innate immune \nsystem and the effector arm of the adaptive immune response and, in the case of i.p. sensitization, \nthe failure to mount effective immune regulation may be caused by events occurring beyond Foxp3  \ntranscription. Finally, the differing trends of infl ammation, goblet cell hyperplasia and mucoid mass \nin the nasal mucosa versus intrapulmonary airway s suggest that, whereas the initiation of effector \nimmune pathways may be coupled in both territori es together, the overall immune response may be \nsubjected to differential regulation in the nose and the lungs. The data are consistent with a \nbiological basis for the epidemiological association between allergic rhinitis and asthma, but the \n\"one airway, one disease\" postulate may be an invalid simplification. \nThe data presented so far on experimental asthma induced by primary antigen exposure in the \nairways are consistent with the presence of  an immunoregulatory arm, operated by Treg \nsubpopulations other than the effector T cells dr iving the effector arm of the adaptive immune \nresponse that leads to the allergic mani festations. Antigen-specific, effector CD4+ T cells had been DISCUSSION \n 147 previously shown to be necessary and sufficie nt to drive airway inflammation and remodeling \n(133). To further demonstrate that FOXP3-expressing T cells may drive immune regulation in an \nexperimental asthma setting, versus the induction of asthma features by effector CD4+ T cells, we \nperformed two series of adoptive transfer experiment s. In the first of such series, antigen-specific \neffector CD4+ T cells were generated by in vitro activation coupled with retroviral gene \ntransduction, and transferred to naive mice as previously done in the rat (133). Coupling in vitro T \ncell activation with gene transduction by oncoretroviral vectors had previously been shown to select \nantigen-specific T cells, because only such cells ente r cell cycle as a result of activation by antigen \nin the presence of antigen-presenting cells, and oncoretrovirus-derived gene transfer vectors can \nonly transduce cells undergoing proliferation (625). This principle was successfully employed as a \ntool to select effector, antigen-specific CD4+ T cells for adoptive transfer in the rat, on the basis of \nGFP gene transduction and subsequent cytometric sorting of GFP+ cells (133). In the experiments \npresented here, we aimed at titrating the mini mum necessary number of  antigen-specific CD4+ T \ncells to induce airway hyperresponsiveness and infl ammation, upon adoptive tr ansfer to naive mice. \nThe recipient mice were i.n.-challenged three times only within a short time window after cell \ntransfer, to prevent any overlap of a host adap tive immune response. In this titration series, 105 \neffector, antigen-specific CD4+ T cells sufficed to induce airway hyperresponsiveness, significantly \nincreased BAL cell counts and apparent airway inflammation on histopathological examination of \nlung tissue sections. Although with no effect on R L, eosinophil recruitment to  the airways could be \nappreciated starting at 2.5 \u22c5104 cell transfer, and the transferred cells could be tracked to the airways \non the basis of their GFP expression. Therefore, following a single i.v. tail injection containing as \nfew as 25,000 effector , antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, some of the cells are able to migrate to the \nairways upon antigen challenge and initiate airway inflammation. It is unlikely that the readily \nobserved presence in the lungs of such few transfer red cells is the result of random distribution in \nthe entire organism. The data are rather consistent  with addressed recruitment, and suggest that \nstaggering small amounts of effector CD4+ T cells may drive airway inflammation and remodeling, \nand subsequent disease manifestations, in actual asthma. This fact may also have implications for \ntherapeutic strategies based on T cell engineering for asthma or other inflammatory conditions, \nsince T cells are a difficult-to-transduce population and the generation of autologous, viable \nengineered cells may not be feasible in large num bers. Our data suggest that quite limited numbers \nof engineered cells may successfully target the diseas ed organ and induce clinically relevant effects. \nIn the second series of adoptive transfer experiments we aimed at testing the effect of transfered \nTreg cells on experimental asthma induced by primary airway antigen ex posure, upon established Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 148 disease. Prior studies in murine models showed th at Treg cells are involved in the induction of \ntolerance during sensitization or prior to airway challenge on sensitized animals (592-594), but did \nnot test the therapeutic potential of Treg cells to  revert established airway disease. The data \npresented here are from pilot experiments where experimental asthma was first induced through \nrepeated i.n. antigen exposure, and the animals r eceived Treg cell transfer at a point where airway \nhyperresponsiveness and inflammation were already patent. Following cell transfer, the animals \nreceived a further course of i.n. antigen instillations  to test the effect of the transferred cells under \nongoing allergen exposure, such as in naturally ac quired disease would occur. In these experiments, \nstandardized HDM extract was used instead of OVA to employ an actual airb orne allergen, already \ntested in previous reports (596, 626, 627). Due to the exploratory nature of these pilot experiments, \nand in keeping with the \"3R\" principle (Repl acement, Reduction, Refinement) (628, 629), we \nemployed the PBS-instilled group of the 30IN model as a control for the HDM-induced asthma. \nHDM-challenged animals showed airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and remodeling as \nreported by others (192), at a time point where OVA-challenged animals showed a decline of \nexperimental asthma features in the IN experiment series. Variability due to the molecular structure \nof each particular allergen, which may determine fact ors such as its interaction with innate immune \nsystem pattern recognition receptors (630), may have contributed to the lack of data consistency \nbetween OVA and HDM as experimental inhaled allergens. The cause of such mismatch is \nnevertheless unclear in the absence of a time line data set for HDM exposure, to demonstrate \nwhether a similar but out-of-phase immunoregulatory trend would exist. Treg cells were generated \nby in vitro activation with antigen coupled w ith retroviral gene transduction as for the CD4+ effector \nT cells, employing for this purpose a gene transfer vector encoding Foxp3  and gfp. It has been \npreviously demonstrated that forced expression of FOXP3 reverts the effector phenotype and turns \nthe CD4+ T cells into functional IL-10-producing Treg cells (411). It is noteworthy that the Treg \ncells generated through this process are antigen-s pecific. Under the experimental design employed \nin these exploratory experiments, Treg cell transf er led to a modest reduction of the inflammatory \ninfiltrates seen on tissue secti ons, without achieving a significa nt impact on BAL cell counts. \nHowever, Treg cell transfer did result in a significant attenuation of airway hyperresponsiveness, \nand the transferred cells reached the lungs as demonstrated by GFP detection. The soundness of the experiments may have been limited by the small group size, and an insufficiently strong \nexperimental intervention. Viable Treg cells generated from retroviral gene transduction under in \nvitro antigen stimulation are a hard-to-obtain cell population, which limited Treg cell dosing to one \nsingle administration of 75,000 cells, aimed at ameliorating established disease. Considering these DISCUSSION \n 149 limitations and valuing the data as preliminary, the outcome suggests that Treg cells have the \npotential to attenuate or revert established asthma if transferred in sufficient, but not necessarily \nlarge, numbers. These adoptive transfer experi ments support that the limitation and further \nattenuation of asthma features observed through the 3IN, 10IN and 30IN model series were at least \nin part driven by the increasing numbers of endogenous lymphoid cells expressing FOXP3 and \nproducing IL10 and TGFB cytokines. It remains unknown whether such endogenous Treg cells \nwhere thymus-derived nTreg cells recruited to the sites of inflammation or, more plausibly, post-\nthymic iTreg cells, which have been shown to regulate Th2-driven inflammation at mucosal sites (631).  \nAlthough a challenging goal, data from experimental disease models should ultimately be \ntranslated to human disease and clinical significance. In the asth ma field, data on Treg cell \npopulations are limited and inconsistent (632). Most  of the scarce clinical Treg cell studies done on \nasthma have reported decreased numbers in peripheral blood in comparison with control subjects \n(633-635) and, in BAL fluid, Treg cells have been  found to be either decreased (588) or increased \n(636). The predominance of studies showing decreased Treg cell numbers, along with reports \nsuggesting impaired responsiveness to chemotactic stimuli (637, 638), suggested a Treg cell \ndeficiency in asthma, a hypothesis provided with a straightforward rationale anyhow. As for Treg \ncell functionality, no direct data have been contribu ted for asthma, but a report showing that Treg \ncells from peripheral blood of atopic subjects have  a decreased capacity to suppress effector CD4\n+ T \ncell proliferation in vitro (639) suggests that Treg cell function may be impaired in at least some \nasthmatics. However, out of the previous studies on  the role of Treg cells in asthma, evidence from \ndirect lung sampling is lacking almost completely. Two studies on Treg cells in BAL fluid, a \nsampling procedure not necessarily representing the status of the airway wall, yielded inconsistent \ndata (588, 636), and no work has been reported on tissue specimens. The difficulty and complex \nlogistics involved in obtaining bronchial biopsies fo r asthma research may explain the lack of direct \nTreg cell data in the airway wall. To contribute data  filling this gap, and to translate our results from \nexperimental asthma modeling to the clinical setting, we performed FOXP3 immunostaining on \nbronchial biopsies from severe asthmatics and co ntrol subjects on specimens from a multicenter \nbiobank specialized in bronchial biopsy for asthma research, that we have developed. We found that FOXP3\n+ cells were virtually absent in control bi opsies, whereas the specimens from asthmatics \nrevealed a significant influx of FOXP3+ mononuclear cells in subepithelial location. The increased \npresence of FOXP3+ cells in bronchial biopsies from subj ects with severe asthma suggests a \nrelevant role of Treg cell-mediated immunoregula tion, and is consistent with our data from the Role of the effector and regulatory arms  of the adaptive immune reseponse in the pathophysiology of experimental asthma \n 150 animal models. Our experimental and clinical data ma y together turn the faulty Treg hypothesis into \nthe possibility that Treg cells ar e reactively increased in asthma, in response to chronic airway \ninflammation. Whether such Treg cells are fully competent or not remains unknown at this point. \nThe failure to physiologically resolve airway inflammation in asthma results from complex, \nmultifactorial causes, not necessarily involving a defi ciency in Treg cell recr uitment or function. It \nis plausible that Treg cells may play a physiological role in bridging the downregulation of \ninflammation with the activation of tissue repair pathways. Because of  the cytokine secretion profile \nof Treg cells, particularly the production of TGFB, a reactive increase of comp etent Treg cells in the \nairway wall might contribute to airway remode ling, particularly subepithelial fibrosis.  \nOverall, we conclude from the work presented in  this thesis that primary airway exposure to \nallergen elicits Treg cell-mediated immunoregul atory mechanisms that may attenuate asthma \nfeatures such as airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation, mucous metaplasia, mucus \nhypersecretion and airway contractile tissue incr ement, whereas subepithelial fibrosis may be \nfavoured as a result of increased TGFB production. Classical models  where experimental asthma is \ninduced by i.p. sensitization fail to reflect such immunoregulatory component of asthma, and may \nmostly represent the effector arm of the disease. Our findings on Foxp3 -expressing cells in the IN \nversus IP models also suggest that mucosal contact during primary antigen exposure may be crucial \nto prime subsequent Treg cell cytokine produc tion and functionality. Therefore, experimental \nasthma models based on primary airway antigen exposure may provide a tool for the joint analysis \nof effector and immunoregulatory pathways, and a closer representation of the overall immune \nresponse in human asthma. Our approach on integrated rhinitis and asthma modeling yielded data \nsuggesting that the immune response may be subjected to complex, differential regulation, and \nhighlights the importance of analyzing the upper and lower airways. Finally, our analysis on \nFOXP3-expressing cells on human bronchial biopsies suggests that, consistently with the \nexperimental asthma data, Treg cells are actively involved in the physiopathology of asthma. \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n CONCLUSIONS \n 153  \nI. Primary airway antigen exposure and con tinued challenge, in comparison with i.p. \nsensitization followed by airway antigen cha llenge, induces experimental asthma with \nattenuation and subsequent downregulation of airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophilic \ninflammation, mucous metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion, and modulates the increase of \nairway contractile tissue mass. On  the contrary, subepithelial fibrosis increases progressively \nand the cellular inflammatory infiltrat es turn predominantly lymphocytic. \nII. On primary airway antigen exposure, goblet cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia are significant, \nboth in the nose and intrapulmonary airways, w ithin an early time window insufficient for the \ndevelopment of an adaptive immune response. Such early mucous response may result from \nmechanisms of innate immunity. \nIII. In the nose, both primary airway antigen exposure and i.p. sensitization lead to allergic \nrhinitis with eosinophilic inflammatory infiltr ation, goblet cell hyperplasia and increased \nmucus production. Contrary to the manifestations of experimental asthma, primary airway \nantigen exposure followed by continued challenge leads to a progessive intensity of rhinitis \nover time. \nIV. Upon primary airway antigen ex posure followed by continued challenge, the attenuation of \nmost experimental asthma features, the progression of subepithelial fibrosis and the shift to \npredominantly lymphocytic inf iltrates are concomintant with a progressive presence of \nFoxp3 , Il10 and Tgfb mRNA-expressing lymphoid cells in the inflammatory infiltrates. \nIntraperitoneal sensitization leads to outstanding numbers of Foxp3  mRNA+ cells in the \ninflammatory infiltrates, not correlated with concordant Il10 or Tgfb transcription. \nV. Adoptively transferred, antig en-specific effector CD4+ T cells drive airway \nhyperresponsiveness and inflammation upon antigen  challenge. Scarce numbers of such cells \nare able to migrate to the airways an d elicit the aforementioned effects.  \nVI. Adoptively transferred,  antigen-specific CD4+ T cells with forced FOXP3 expression act as \nTreg cells in vivo and downregulate airw ay hyperresponsiveness and inflammation on \nestablished experimental asthma. Scarce numbers of such cells are able to migrate to the \nairways and elicit the aforementioned effects.  \nVII. FOXP3+ lymphoid cells are significantly increased in bronchial biopsies of severe asthmatics \nversus control subjects. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n REFERENCES \n 157 1.

Th e last cycle was final \nelongation. Therefore, a typi cal PCR reaction cycle was: \n \nN\u00ba cycles  Temperature (\u00baC)  Time  \n1 95 5 min \n95 30 s \nTa 30 s 30 \n72 Et \n1 72 5 min \n \nWhere Ta: annealing temperature (depending on  primers); Et: elongation time (we used 1 \nminute per 1000 base length elongation. \n \n7. Lipofectamine transfection protocol  \n100.000 Phoenix cells were cultured with DMEM medium (Gibco, Invitrogen), 5% foetal \nbovine serum (FBS) (Gibco) and without antibiotics in a 24-we ll plate (Corning) until reaching \napproximately 95% confluence. Plasmidic DNA was linealized by digestion and purified before each transfection experiment to facilitate  cell DNA integration. Lipofectamine (2 \u03bcL) was diluted \ninto 50 \u03bcL DMEN and incubated at RT for 5 minutes. Lipofectamine solution was then mixed with \n50 \u03bcL of DMEN containing 0.8 \u03bcg of lineal plasmidic DNA and incubated for 20 minutes at RT. \nEach well was incubated with this transfection so lution for 4 hours and then changed with fresh \nmedium. Then after 24 hours of transfection, each well was tryps inized (trypsine, Gibco) and \ncultured into a 10 cm culture plate (Gibco) with  fresh medium. The following day, cells were \ncultured with DMEM, 5% FBS, 1% Penicillin-Str eptomycin-Glutamine (PSG), all from Gibco \n(Invitrogen), and using 2 \u00b5g/mL Puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a selective medium for successfully transfected ce lls. Cell culture was mainta ined until cell colonies were visible. The plate \nwas then trypsinized and expanded, obtaining a transfected pool cell population.  \n \n8. Retrovirus titration\n \nNIH3T3 cells (200.000) were seeded on 6-well plates and cultured with DMEM 5% FBS for 48 \nhours. Representative wells were co unted for the average of cells in  each well. Virus supernatant, \n0.5 \u03bcl, 5 \u03bcl, 50 \u03bcl and 500 \u03bcl of were added to the wells in duplicate, using 6 \u03bcg/ml polybrene in \neach well. Cells were incubated with virus suspen sion for 24 hours and then replaced by fresh \nDMEM 10% FBS 1% PSG. After 48 hours, transduced cultures were collected and analyzed using cytometry (FacsScalibur) with Scell Quest softwa re. Virus stock titer was calculated according to \ntake the following: TU/mL = n\u00ba cells x (% of GFP positive cells/100)/ mL of virus used,  where TU is \nthe transforming unit and thenumber of cells refers to the amount of cells at the beginning of the culture. \n \n9. Western blot assay for FOXP3 expression\n \nNIH3T3 cells were cultured and transduced as pr eviously described: cells were cultured in six-\nwell plates with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% PSG at 37\u00baC ambient air, supplemented with 5% CO\n2 as normal culture conditions. Additionally, medium was supplemented with 6 \u00b5g/mL \npolybrene during pRetroFOXP3-IRES-GFP viral transduction in a 1:1 cell-virus ratio. Cell cultures \nwere lysed for 30 minutes in 0.3 mL of 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; and 1% Triton X-100) containing 5 \u03bcg/mL lupeptin, 50 mM phenyl-methylsulfonyl APPENDIX \n 189 fluoride, and 7.2 trypsin inhibitor units for aprotinin. After centrifugation at 14000 g for 10 min, 50 \n\u03bcg of the protein contained in the supernatant was resuspeneded in Laemmli\u2019s buffer (4% SDS, 20 \nglicerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.004% bromophenol blue, Tris-HCl 0.125 M) and loaded in 10% polyacrilamide SDS-PAGE and running at 200V for 40 minutes. \u0392-mercaptoethanol and SDS give \nnegative charge to proteins according to the mass, so they can migrate to the anode. Samples were \ntransferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) runni ng at 70V for 1 hour. Membranes were blocked \nwith blocking buffer (3% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20) overnight at 4\u00baC. Once blocked, membranes \nwere incubated for 2 hours with primary antibodies against Foxp3 (eBioscience, Rat monoclonal, \n1:5000), GFP (Abcam, Rabbit monoclonal, 1:10000) and \u03b1-tubulin (Sigma, mouse monoclonal, \n1:2000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG, donkey anti-rabbit IgG or \ngoat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, USA) and detected using \nLumiPico\n\u00ae ECL kit (ShineGene, Shanghai, China) acco rding to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  \n \n10.

Summary  \n \nCastellano \nEl asma afecta aproximadamente a unos 300 millones de personas en todo el mundo. Su \nprevalencia se ha incrementado, especialmente en  los pa\u00edses industrializados, habiendo llegado a \ndoblarse en solamente una d\u00e9cada en la Uni\u00f3n Europea. A pesar de los desarrollos terap\u00e9uticos ya \nalcanzados, aproximadamente un 10% de los asm\u00e1tico s sufren enfermedad grave refractaria a la \nterapia m\u00e1xima disponible. El asma es una enfe rmedad compleja caracteri zada principalmente por \nla inflamaci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica de la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea junto con cambios estructurales, conocidos mediante el \nt\u00e9rmino \u201cremodelaci\u00f3n\u201d, que subyace n a las manifestaciones cl\u00ednicas y gravedad de la enfermedad, \nespecialmente al deterioro irreversible de funci\u00f3n pulmonar que existe en algunos asm\u00e1ticos. La \nremodelaci\u00f3n de v\u00edas respiratorias en el asma ocur re en asociaci\u00f3n a la inflamaci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica, resulta \nen anormalidades estructurales permanentes en su pared, y afecta v\u00edas respiratorias de todas las \ncategor\u00edas en cuanto a localizaci\u00f3n y tama\u00f1o. Se entiende actualmente que la remodelaci\u00f3n de las \nv\u00edas respiratorias forma parte del sustrato fisiopatol\u00f3gico de la hiperreactividad bronquial y la \nobstrucci\u00f3n al flujo a\u00e9reo, y puede comenzar en una fase temprana de la enfermedad, previa a la \naparici\u00f3n de s\u00edntomas. Los cambios estructurales descritos como parte de la remodelaci\u00f3n de v\u00edas \nrespiratorias son: (i) engrosamiento del epitelio respiratorio, junto con hiperplasia e hipertrofia de \nc\u00e9lulas caliciformes; (ii) aumento del tama\u00f1o y n\u00famero de gl\u00e1ndulas mucosas que se traduce, junto \ncon los cambios en las c\u00e9lulas caliciformes, en la hi persecreci\u00f3n de moco a la luz de la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea, \nparticipando de forma especial en la obstrucci\u00f3n al flujo a\u00e9reo de instauraci\u00f3n s\u00fabita en el contexto \nde crisis, y contribuyendo al desarrollo de atelect asias; (iii) hiperplasia de c\u00e9lulas caliciformes, \nasociada a la hipersecrecci\u00f3n de moco; (iv) fibros is subepitelial, debida a un dep\u00f3sito excesivo de \nmatriz extracelular en la capa de tejido conjuntivo que subyace al epitelio bron quial; (v) \nangiog\u00e9nesis bronquial y permeabilidad vascular alterada, que facilita la formaci\u00f3n de edema; y (vi) \naumento de la masa de m\u00fasculo liso bronquial y bronquiolar, debido a la combinaci\u00f3n de \nhiperplasia e hipertrofia de las c\u00e9lulas muscular es lisas, m\u00e1s una probable contribuci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas \nprogenitoras circulantes que son reclutadas y se di ferencian a miofibroblasto y c\u00e9lula muscular lisa. \nDe entre estos cambios, el m\u00e1s estudiado es la remodelaci\u00f3n del m\u00fasculo liso, que se considera de \nimportancia central en el mecanismo de la hiperreactividad bronquial y obstrucci\u00f3n al flujo a\u00e9reo. \nLos modelos animales de enfermedad experi mental permiten el estudio de mecanismos \nbiol\u00f3gicos de enfermedad con un detalle y profundidad no posible en sujetos humanos. Los modelos \nanimales de asma experimental han contribuido  a una mejor comprensi\u00f3n y tratamiento de la APPENDIX \n 209 enfermedad en humanos. La especie m\u00e1s ampliament e utilizada para modelar asma experimental es \nel rat\u00f3n, tanto por reproducir la mayor\u00eda de los rasgos patol\u00f3gicos de la enfermedad humana como \npor su bajo coste y f\u00e1cil manejo. La fisiopatolog\u00eda del asma ha sido ampliamente estudiada en \nmodelos de asma experimental basados en sens ibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal a ant\u00edgenos junto con \ncoadyuvantes seguido de provocaci\u00f3n con el ant\u00edgen o en la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea. Este procedimiento reproduce \ncon intensidad la mayor\u00eda de signos de la enfermedad asm\u00e1tica, tales como la hiperreactividad \nbronquial y remodelaci\u00f3n de v\u00edas respiratorias, a trav\u00e9s de una respuesta al\u00e9rgica tipo Th2 con \nelevados niveles de IgE. Sin embargo, esta estrateg ia experimental no represen ta el modo real en el \nque los humanos desarrollan asma y rinitis  al\u00e9rgica por sensibilizaci\u00f3n y exposici\u00f3n a \naeroal\u00e9rgenos, y puede haber diferencias relevantes  en los mecanismos biol\u00f3gicos subyacentes. De \nhecho, el contacto di recto de la mucosa del tracto respiratorio  con el ant\u00edgeno alerg\u00e9nico es con gran \nprobabilidad esencial para la funci\u00f3n del sistema inmunitario innato, e interacciones a este nivel \npueden determinar la subsiguiente respuesta inmunitaria, en t\u00e9rminos de ataque o tolerancia. Es \naltamente probable que los modelos de asma al\u00e9r gica experimental que se basan en sensibilizaci\u00f3n \nintraperitoneal se salten un paso crucial para entender la fisiopatolog\u00eda del asma. Por tanto, modelos \nanimales basados en exposici\u00f3n primaria al ant\u00edgeno en la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea, sin sensibilizaci\u00f3n \nintraperitoneal tipo \"vacuna\", pueden tener el pote ncial de reflejar de un modo m\u00e1s integral el \ndesarrollo del asma al\u00e9rgica, por involucrar las v\u00edas inmunorreguladoras que los modelos basados \nen sensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal pueden fallan en reflejar. En dichas v\u00edas inmunorreguladoras, \npueden estar implicadas c\u00e9lulas T con funci\u00f3n reguladora (c\u00e9lulas Treg). Desde la descripci\u00f3n en \n2003 del factor de transcripci\u00f3n FOXP3 como responsable del fenotipo regulador de c\u00e9lulas T \nCD4+, han sido descritos diversos tipos de c\u00e9lulas T con fenotipo regulador. Auque en la actualidad \nes generalmente aceptado que no todas las c\u00e9lul as con fenotipo regulador expresan FOXP3, la \ndetecci\u00f3n de este marcador contin\u00faa siendo un in strumento de gran utilidad en el estudio de la \nfunci\u00f3n inmunoreguladora vehiculada por c\u00e9lulas T CD4+.  \nA todo esto hay que a\u00f1adir que la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea superior ha sido extensamente ignorada en los \nmodelos animales de asma experimental. Recientemente, se ha desarrollado la teor\u00eda de la \u201cv\u00eda \na\u00e9rea \u00fanica\u201d, que postula que el asma y la rinitis son dos manifestaciones diferentes de una misma \nenfermedad, en dos partes de una v\u00eda a\u00e9rea com \u00fan. Aunque esta teor\u00eda es criticada de ser \nexcesivamente simplista, existe evidencia de una asociaci\u00f3n entre rinitis al\u00e9rgica y asma, y de una \nrelaci\u00f3n biol\u00f3gica e inmunol\u00f3gica entre la mucosa de la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea superior, y la de las v\u00edas \nrespiratorias intrapulmonares.  Summary \n 210 Por todo ello, en el presente trabajo de tesis doctoral nos propusimos desarrollar un modelo \nintegrado de rinitis al\u00e9rgica y asma basado en exposici\u00f3n primaria antig\u00e9nica en v\u00eda respiratoria, y \nestudiar en este modelo la existencia de mecanismos de inmunorregulaci\u00f3n acoplados a la respuesta \nefectora generadora del asma, y la posible implicaci\u00f3n de las c\u00e9lulas Treg en el desarrollo de la \nenfermedad. Adicionalmente, para a\u00f1adir valor tras lacional b\u00e1sico-cl\u00ednico a los datos obtenidos en \nlos modelos animales, realizamos an\u00e1lisis en biopsias bronquiales humanas. \nPara explorar la respuesta a la sensibilizaci\u00f3n al \u00e9rgica en la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea, desarrollamos modelos de \nexposici\u00f3n primaria a OVA en v\u00eda a\u00e9rea mediante  instilaci\u00f3n intranasal repetida en r\u00e9gimen lunes-\nmi\u00e9rcoles-viernes, en ausencia de adyuvantes inmunol\u00f3gicos, con recogida de datos y estudio en \ntres puntos de tiempo diferentes: (i) un punto  temprano exploratorio de enfermedad m\u00ednima o \nincipiente (tres instilaciones, denominado modelo 3IN); (ii) un punto de intervalo de tiempo desde \nla primera exposici\u00f3n an tig\u00e9nica equivalente a un modelo cl\u00e1s ico de sensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal \n(10 instilaciones, denominado modelo 10IN, que fue comparado con el modelo de sensibilizaci\u00f3n \nintraperitoneal -IP-); y (iii) un modelo prolongado pa ra explorar si el grado de enfermedad reflejado \nen el modelo 10IN se reforzar\u00eda, alcanzar\u00eda un plateau  o se atenuar\u00eda si la exposici\u00f3n antig\u00e9nica \nintranasal se extendiese (30 instilaciones, modelo 30IN). En  el modelo de sensibilizaci\u00f3n \nintraperitoneal, los an imales mostraron, tras tres broncopr ovocaciones intranasales: hiperreactividad \nbronquial a metacolina, infiltraci\u00f3n leucocitaria de predominio eosin\u00f3filo en lavado broncoalveolar, \ninfiltraci\u00f3n inflamatoria as imismo eosin\u00f3fila de v\u00edas respirator ias mostrada en secciones de tejido \npulmonar y nasal, incremento de la presencia de sustancias mucosas en v\u00edas a\u00e9reas superior en \ninferiores, incremento de la masa de m\u00fasculo liso en v\u00edas respiratorias intrapulmonares; y un \naumento notable de c\u00e9lulas con expresi\u00f3n de mRNA de Foxp3  con aumento limitado de c\u00e9lulas con \nexpresi\u00f3n de mRNA de Il10 y Tgfb. \nEn los modelos de exposici\u00f3n antig\u00e9nica primaria  en v\u00eda respiratoria, la reactividad de v\u00edas \nrespiratorias a metacolina result\u00f3 atenuada en el m odelo 10IN respecto al modelo IP, y declin\u00f3 en el \nmodelo 30IN. Los tres modelos de exposici\u00f3n antig\u00e9nica primaria en v\u00eda a\u00e9rea presentan un \naumento de c\u00e9lulas totales en lavado broncoalveolar con predominancia de linfocitos. Los modelos \n10IN y 30IN mostraron infiltraci\u00f3n inflamatoria  pulmonar con presencia de eosin\u00f3filos, pero \natenuada respecto al modelo IP, y con un viraje del recuento diferencial hacia predominio linfocitario. Sin embargo el infiltrado inflamatorio en la mucosa nasal fue comparable al modelo IP, \nexcepto en el modelo de 3IN, en el que no se apr eci\u00f3 un aumento respecto al grupo control. En lo \nque respecta a la producci\u00f3n de sustancias muco sas, los intranasales mostraron un aumento \nprogresivo de la respuesta mucoide en el epitelio nasal, desde las 3 instilaciones hasta las 30, siendo APPENDIX \n 211 este \u00faltimo modelo comparable a lo obtenido en el modelo IP. Por el contrario, la respuesta mucoide \nen pulm\u00f3n, aunque aumentada respecto a los grupos control tras 3, 10 y 30 instilaciones, result\u00f3 \natenuada respecto al modelo IP. En lo que concie rne a la deposici\u00f3n de ma triz extracelular, tras 3 \ninstilaciones intranasales no se apr eciaron diferencias significativas respecto al grupo control ni al \nmodelo IP; sin embargo, s\u00ed se apreci\u00f3 fibrosis s ubepitelial tras 10 y 30 instilaciones intranasales, lo \nque sugiere que la fibrosis subepitelial es un fen\u00f3meno progresivo con la duraci\u00f3n de la \nenfermedad. La masa de m\u00fasculo liso solo result\u00f3 incrementada pero de forma atenuada en el \nmodelo 30IN, de forma concomitante a la atenuaci \u00f3n observada en la hipe rreactividad bronquial. La \nobtenci\u00f3n de una respuesta al\u00e9rgica con m\u00e1ximo atenuado y subsiguiente declive en los modelos \nintranasales, en comparaci\u00f3n con el modelo de se nsibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal como comparador de \ncapacidad de respuesta m\u00e1xima, sugiere que la exposi ci\u00f3n primaria antig\u00e9nica en  v\u00eda respiratoria, tal \ncomo ocurre en la adquisici\u00f3n natural de enfermedad humana, activan mecanismos \ninmunoreguladores. La evidencia de este brazo inmunoregulador, reflejado en la atenuaci\u00f3n de la \ninflamaci\u00f3n e hiperreactividad de v\u00edas respiratorias, nos condujo a explorar un posible papel de \nc\u00e9lulas Treg. Debido a dificultades t\u00e9cnicas para la  detecci\u00f3n de prote\u00edna FO XP3 en tejido de rat\u00f3n \nfijado con formalina, analizamos la expresi\u00f3n de mRNA de Foxp3 en estos modelos, junto con la \nexpresi\u00f3n de mRNA de Il10 y Tgfb, dos citoquinas directamente rel acionadas con la funci\u00f3n de las \nc\u00e9lulas T reguladoras. Estos an\u00e1lisis , realizados mediante hibridaci\u00f3n in situ sobre secciones de \ntejido pulmonar, condujeron a la detecci\u00f3n en los infiltrados inflamatorios de un aumento \nprogresivo de la cantidad de c\u00e9lulas que expresaban Foxp3 , Il10 y Tgfb hasta alcanzar sus m\u00e1ximos \nniveles en el modelo 30IN. La cantidad de c\u00e9lulas con expresi\u00f3n de Il10 y Tgfb fue comparable a lo \nobservado en el modelo de sensibilizaci\u00f3n intraper itoneal. Sin embargo, la cantidad de c\u00e9lulas con \nexpresi\u00f3n de Foxp3  en el modelo IP fue desproporcionadamente elevada, sugiriendo la presencia de \nc\u00e9lulas Foxp3+ sin funcionalidad inmunoreguladora. \nEstos datos mostraron que la exposici\u00f3n primaria  a ant\u00edgeno en la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea y en ausencia de \nsensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal o adyuvantes induce ri nitis al\u00e9rgica que progre sa durante el per\u00edodo \nde exposici\u00f3n al ant\u00edgeno, y asma experimental  atenuada que se modula como resultado de la \nexposici\u00f3n continuada. Esta modulaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 asociada con un aumento de los n\u00fameros de c\u00e9lulas \nlinfoides que expresan Foxp3, Il10 y Tgfb en los infiltrados inflamatorios pulmonares, lo que \nsugiere mecanismos de inmunorregulaci\u00f3n activa que los modelos basados en sensibilizaci\u00f3n \nintraperitoneal fallan en reflejar. Los resultados obtenidos en esta primera parte del trabajo de \ninvestigaci\u00f3n doctoral mostraron que la exposici\u00f3n primaria y continuada a ant\u00edgeno en las v\u00edas \nrespiratorias induce la activaci\u00f3n de un brazo inmunoregulador que resulta en la atenuaci\u00f3n de los Summary \n 212 rasgos del asma al\u00e9rgica experimental, pero no de  la rinitis al\u00e9rgica, sugiriendo adem\u00e1s un papel \nimportante de c\u00e9lulas Treg productoras de IL10 y TGFB. Este conjunto de datos fue asimismo \nconsistente con la hip\u00f3tesis de que la interacci\u00f3n del al\u00e9rgeno con la mucosa de la v\u00eda respiratoria en \nel momento de la exposici\u00f3n antig \u00e9nica primaria es crucial, median te la probable participaci\u00f3n del \nsistema inmunitario innato, para definir el perfil de respuesta subsiguiente a cargo del sistema \ninmunitario adaptativo. As\u00ed pues, en la siguiente parte del trabajo nos propusimos demostrar el \npapel de c\u00e9lulas T efectoras CD4+ y c\u00e9lulas T reguladoras CD4+ en el asma experimental. \nPara estudiar el papel de las c\u00e9lulas T CD4+ efectoras y reguladoras, realizamos experimentos \nde transferencia adoptiva en dos modelos de exposi ci\u00f3n antig\u00e9nica en v\u00eda a\u00e9rea. Con la finalidad de \nrealizar seguimiento in vivo  de las c\u00e9lulas transferidas, proced imos a su modificaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica para \ninducir la expresi\u00f3n permanente de una variante de  prote\u00edna verde fluorescente (GFP). La expansi\u00f3n \nclonal de c\u00e9lulas T activadas representa el cicl o celular m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido conocido entre las c\u00e9lulas de \norganismos pluricelulares . Dada la necesidad de conseguir la  modificaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica permanente de \nlas c\u00e9lulas diana y su progenie, nos decantamos por  la transducci\u00f3n retroviral empleando vectores \nde tipo onco-retroviral que, tras su retrotranscripci\u00f3n, se integran de forma permanente en el \ngenoma de las c\u00e9lulas transducidas, y con ello el  cDNA de inter\u00e9s subclonado en el vector. Para \nello, estos vectores aprovechan la ausencia de envoltura nuclear durante la mitosis (metafase y \nanafase) para integrarse en el genoma celular y originar expresi\u00f3 n constitutiva. Esta caracter\u00edstica, \ncombinada con la estimulaci\u00f3n in vitro  de c\u00e9lulas T efectoras ant\u00edgeno-espec\u00edficas obtenidas de \ndonantes sensibilizados a un dete rminado ant\u00edgeno, resulta en un m\u00e9todo eficaz para la transducci\u00f3n \nde c\u00e9lulas T efectoras ant\u00edgeno-es pec\u00edficas, dado que el tipo de vector de transferencia g\u00e9nica \nempleado solamente transduce c\u00e9lulas en ciclo cel ular activo, y \u00fanicamente las c\u00e9lulas T CD4+ \nant\u00edgeno-espec\u00edficas entran en ci clo celular cuando una poblaci\u00f3n de esplenocitos de un animal \nsensibilizado se expone al ant\u00edgeno in vitro . \nTras el dise\u00f1o y construcci\u00f3n del vector retr oviral de transferencia g\u00e9nica para inducir \nexpresi\u00f3n permanente de GFP, al que hemos denominado pMSCV-GFP por derivarse de un Murine \nStem Cell Virus , procedimos a generar mediante transducci\u00f3n y separar por citometr\u00eda de flujo \nc\u00e9lulas T CD4+GFP+ efectoras, con las cuales realizamos un modelo de asma experimental basado \nen transferencia ad optiva de estas c\u00e9lulas a animales recep tores sing\u00e9nicos no sensibilizados, y \nposterior instilaci\u00f3n intranasal del ant\u00edgeno (OVA) en  los animales receptores.  En este modelo, nos \npropusimos titular el n\u00famero m\u00ednimo de c\u00e9lulas T CD4+ ant\u00edgeno-espec\u00edficas efectoras necesario \npara inducir hiperreactividad e inflamaci\u00f3n de v\u00edas  respiratorias, bajo la hip\u00f3tesis de que muy \npeque\u00f1as cantidades de estas c\u00e9lulas ser\u00edan sufici entes. Los ratones recepto res fueron instilados dos APPENDIX \n 213 veces con OVA antes de la transfer encia adoptiva y tres veces despu\u00e9 s (5 instilaciones intranasales), \nen forma de un modelo breve para prevenir posible solapamiento con una respuesta inmunitaria \nadaptativa que el hu\u00e9sped podr\u00eda desarrollar. Realizamos series de titulaci\u00f3n, que mostraron que la \ntransferencia adoptiva de 105 c\u00e9lulas T efectoras CD4+ OVA-espec\u00edficas es su ficiente para inducir \nhiperreactividad a metacolina, incremento de c\u00e9lulas totales en el lavado broncoalveolar e \ninflamaci\u00f3n de la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea evidente en el an\u00e1lisis  histopatol\u00f3gico del tejido pulmonar, donde se \ndetectaron c\u00e9lulas GFP+. Estos datos indicaron que peque\u00f1os n\u00fameros de c\u00e9lulas T CD4+ efectoras \nant\u00edgeno-espec\u00edficas tienen la capacidad de migrar a las v\u00edas respiratorias y dirigir la inflamaci\u00f3n en \nuna respuesta inmunitaria adaptativa al\u00e9rgica.  \nEn el segundo modelo de transferencia adoptiva, nos propusimos comprobar el efecto de la \ntransferencia de c\u00e9lulas Treg en un modelo de asma experimental con enfermedad establecida, \ninducido en este caso por exposici\u00f3n primaria en  v\u00eda a\u00e9rea a extracto estandarizado de \u00e1caros del \npolvo ( house dust mite , en adelante HDM). Para las finalida des de este experimento se generaron \nc\u00e9lulas T CD4+ reguladoras in vitro  mediante transducci\u00f3n retrovir al de una manera similar a la \nobtenci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas T  CD4+ efectoras descrita anteriormente, pero a partir de donantes \nsensibilizados a HDM. En este caso se construy\u00f3 un vector retroviral bicistr\u00f3nico que contiene las \nsecuencias de Foxp3  y gfp separadas por una secuencia in terna de entrada ribosomal (un internal \nribosome entry site , en adelante IRES), vector al que de nominamos pRetroFOXP3-IRES-GFP. Este \nvector induce la expresi\u00f3n simult \u00e1nea de FOXP3 y GFP en las c\u00e9lulas transducidas, de forma que la \ndetecci\u00f3n de GFP permite la identificaci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas FOXP3+. La expresi\u00f3n forzada de FOXP3 \ngenerada de este modo en c\u00e9lulas T CD4+ activadas induce funci\u00f3n re guladora en estas c\u00e9lulas, es \ndecir, genera c\u00e9lulas Treg. Adem\u00e1s, las c\u00e9lulas Treg as\u00ed generadas son ant\u00edgeno-espec\u00edficas. Los \nanimales receptores fueron instilados con HDM un total de 28 veces a lo largo de 40 d\u00edas de \nduraci\u00f3n del modelo. En el grupo receptor de tr ansferencia adoptiva, 75.0 00 c\u00e9lulas Treg fueron \ninyectadas en la vena de la cola antes de la finalizaci\u00f3n de las instilaciones intranasales (en la \ninstilaci\u00f3n 24, d\u00eda 31). En este experimento piloto (n=4 por grupo), la transferencia adoptiva de \nsolamente estas 75.000 c\u00e9lulas Treg generadas in vitro  provoc\u00f3 una modesta reducci\u00f3n en los \ninfiltrados inflamatorios en tejido pulmonar, sin modificar significativamente los recuentos de \nc\u00e9lulas totales en lavado broncoalveolar, y se observ\u00f3 asimismo una atenuaci\u00f3n de la hiperreactividad de v\u00edas respirat orias, demostr\u00e1ndose mediante de tecci\u00f3n de GFP que las c\u00e9lulas \ntransferidas estaban presentes en los infiltrados inflamatorios en las v\u00edas respiratorias \nintrapulmonares. Summary \n 214 Como \u00faltimo objetivo y con un enfoque traslacional, nos propusimos explorar la aplicabilidad \nde los datos obtenidos en los modelos animales a la enfermedad humana. Los datos sobre c\u00e9lulas \nTreg en el asma humana est\u00e1n en una fase muy in cipiente y los resultados en este sentido son \nlimitados e inconsistentes. La totalidad de los escas os trabajos realizados so bre c\u00e9lulas Treg en el \nasma humana se han centrado en la detecci\u00f3n de dichas c\u00e9lulas en sangre perif\u00e9rica o lavado \nbroncoalveolar, pero hasta la fecha no existen estudios sobre tejido pulmonar. Teniendo en cuenta \nesta carencia, nos propusimos estudi ar la presencia de c\u00e9lulas FOXP3+ mediante \ninmunohistoqu\u00edmica en biopsias bronquiales de pacientes con asma grave y compararlos con sujetos control. Hemos hallado que las c\u00e9lulas FOXP3\n+ est\u00e1n pr\u00e1cticamente ausentes en biopsias de sujetos \ncontrol. Por el contrario, las biopsias de pacientes con asma grave mostraron una presencia \nsignificativa de c\u00e9lulas FOXP3+ infiltrando principalmente zonas de tejido conectivo laxo \nsubepitelial. Este aumento de c\u00e9lulas FOXP3+ en biopsias bronquiales de  pacientes con asma grave \nsugiere un papel de la inmunorregulaci\u00f3n mediada por c\u00e9lulas Treg, y es adem\u00e1s consistente con los \ndatos derivados de modelos animales. Nuestro conjunto de datos generados a partir de asma \nexperimental e investigaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica sugiere que las c\u00e9lulas Treg est\u00e1n aumentadas en la pared de las \nv\u00edas respiratorias en el asma, pr obablemente de forma reactiva a la  inflamaci\u00f3n cr\u00f3ni ca que subyace \na la enfermedad. Si las c\u00e9lulas FOXP3+ observadas en las biopsias bronquiales humanas son \nfuncionalmente competentes como c\u00e9lulas Treg o no, es desconocido en este punto y, por tanto, se \nnecesitan nuevos estudios que las caractericen de fo rma m\u00e1s extensa en sujetos asm\u00e1ticos. El fallo \nen resolver la inflamaci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica de las v\u00edas respiratorias en el asma tiene con toda probabilidad \nuna causa compleja multifactorial, y no necesaria mente implica una deficiencia en la funci\u00f3n o \nreclutamiento de c\u00e9lulas Treg. \nDe los resultados obtenidos en el presente trabajo de tesis doctoral se puede concluir que:  \n- La exposici\u00f3n primaria en la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea y la provocaci\u00f3n continuada con ant\u00edgeno, a diferencia \nde la sensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal seguida de provocaci\u00f3n intranasal, induce asma experimental \natenuada con disminuci\u00f3n de la hiperreacitividad de v\u00edas respiratorias, la hipersecreci\u00f3n de moco y \nligero aumento de la masa de m\u00fasculo liso. Por el contrario, la fibrosis subepitelial aumenta \nprogresivamente y los infiltrados inflamatorios giran hacia un predominio linfocitario. \n- Tras la exposici\u00f3n primaria a ant\u00edgeno en la v\u00ed a a\u00e9rea, se produce una hipertrofia e hiperplasia \nde c\u00e9lulas caliciformes, tanto en v\u00eda a\u00e9rea superior como v\u00edas respiratorias inferiores, en un espacio \nde tiempo insuficiente para el desarrollo de una respuesta inmunitaria adaptativa. Esta respuesta \nmucosa temprana podr\u00eda ser el resultado de la acci \u00f3n de mecanismos del sistema inmunitario innato. APPENDIX \n 215 - En la mucosa nasal, tanto la exposici \u00f3n primaria a ant\u00edgeno en v\u00eda a\u00e9rea como la \nsensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal previa, inducen ri nitis al\u00e9rgica con infiltraci\u00f3n eosinof\u00edlica, \nhiperplasia de c\u00e9lulas caliciformes y aumento de la producci\u00f3n de moco. Al contrario de las \nmanifestaciones del asma experimental, la exposici\u00f3n  primaria a ant\u00edgeno en la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea seguida de \nprovocaci\u00f3n continuada provoca un aume nto progresivo de la intensidad  de la rinitis al\u00e9rgica con el \ntiempo. \n- Tras la exposici\u00f3n primaria a ant\u00edgeno en la  v\u00eda a\u00e9rea seguida de provocaci\u00f3n intranasal \ncontinuada, la atenuaci\u00f3n de la mayor parte de  las caracter\u00edsticas del asma experimental, la \nprogresi\u00f3n de la fibrosis subepitelial y el viraje hacia infiltrados predominantemente linfocitarios \nest\u00e1n asociados con una progresiva presencia en el infiltrado inflamatorio de c\u00e9lulas que expresan \nmRNA de Foxp3 , Il10 y Tgfb. La sensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal tiene como consecuencia un \naumento anormal de c\u00e9lulas que expresan mRNA de Foxp3  en el infiltrado inflamatorio, pero que \nno se correlaciona con un aumento concordante en la transcripci\u00f3n de Il10 y Tgfb. \n- C\u00e9lulas T CD4+ efectoras ant\u00edgeno-espec\u00edficas diri gen el reclutamiento de c\u00e9lulas \ninflamatorias y la hiperreactividad de v\u00edas respirat orias tras la provocaci\u00f3n antig\u00e9nica. Estas c\u00e9lulas, \nen escasa cantidad, son capaces de migrar a las v\u00edas respiratorias y provocar los efectos \nmencionados. \n- C\u00e9lulas T efectoras CD4+ ant\u00edgeno-espec\u00edficas con expresi\u00f3 n forzada de FOXP3 act\u00faan como \nc\u00e9lulas Treg in vivo  y modulan la hiperreactividad e inflamaci \u00f3n de las v\u00edas respiratorias en modelos \nanimales con asma experimental establecida. Estas c\u00e9lulas, en escaso n\u00famero, son capaces de \nmigrar a las v\u00edas respiratorias y provocar los efectos mencionados. \n- Existe un aumento significativo en la presencia de linfocitos FOXP3+ en biopsias bronquiales \nde pacientes con asma grave en comparaci\u00f3n con sujetos control. Dicho aumento puede reflejar un \nincremento de c\u00e9lulas Treg re activo a la inflamaci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica. \n Summary \n 216 Galego \nA asma afecta a uns 300 mill\u00f3ns de persoas en to do o mundo. A sua prev alencia incrementouse, \nespecialmente nos pa\u00edses industria lizados, chegando a duplicarse en tan s\u00f3 unha d\u00e9cada na Uni\u00f3n \nEuropea. A pesares dos desarroios terap\u00e9uticos xa acadados, aproximadamente un 10% dos \nasm\u00e1ticos sofren enfermidade grave refractaria \u00e1 terapia m\u00e1xima dispo\u00f1ible. A asma \u00e9 unha \nenfermidade complexa caracteri zada principalmente pola inflam aci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica da v\u00eda a\u00e9rea xunto \ncon cambios estructurais, co\u00f1ecidos mediante  o t\u00e9rmino \u201cremodelaci\u00f3n\u201d, que subxace \u00e1s \nmanifestaci\u00f3ns cl\u00ednicas e gravidade da enfermidad e, especialmente \u00f3 deterioro irreversible da \nfunci\u00f3n pulmonar que se encontra nalg\u00fans asm\u00e1ticos . A remodelaci\u00f3n das v\u00edas respiratorias na asma \nocorre en asociaci\u00f3n \u00e1 in flamaci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica, resulta en anormalid ades estructurais permanentes na \ns\u00faa parede, e afecta v\u00edas respiratorias de t\u00f3da las categor\u00edas en canto a localizaci\u00f3n e tama\u00f1o. \nEnt\u00e9ndese actualmente que a remodelaci\u00f3n das v\u00edas respiratorias forma parte do sustrato \nfisiopatol\u00f3xico da hiperreactivid ade bronquial e a obstruci\u00f3n \u00f3 fluxo a\u00e9reo, e pode empezar cedo na \nenfermidade, previo \u00e1 aparici\u00f3n de s\u00edntomas. Os  cambios estructur\u00e1is descritos como parte da \nremodelaci\u00f3n de v\u00edas respiratorias son: (i) engrosamento do epitelio respiratorio, xunto con \nhiperplasia e hipertrofia de c\u00e9lulas caliciformes; (ii) aumento do tama\u00f1o e n\u00famero das gl\u00e1ndulas \nmucosas que se traduce, xunto cos cambios nas c\u00e9l ulas caliciformes, na hipersecreci\u00f3n de moco \u00e1 \nluz da v\u00eda a\u00e9rea, participando de xeito especial na obstrucci\u00f3n \u00f3 fluxo a\u00e9reo de instauraci\u00f3n s\u00fabita \nno contexto de crise, e contribu\u00edndo \u00f3 desarroio  de atelectasias; (iii) hiperplasia de c\u00e9lulas \ncaliciformes, asociada \u00e1 hipersecrecci\u00f3n de moco (i v) fibrose subepitelial, debida a un dep\u00f3sito \nexcesivo de matriz extracelular na capa de teci do conxuntivo que subxace \u00f3 epitelio bronquial; (v) \nanxiox\u00e9nese bronquial e permeabilidade vascular alterada, que facilita a formaci\u00f3n de edema; e (vi) \naumento da masa de m\u00fasculo liso bronquial e bronquiolar, por mor da combinaci\u00f3n de hiperplasia e \nhipertrofia das c\u00e9lulas musculares lisas, m\u00e1is unha probable contribuci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas proxenitoras \ncirculantes que son reclutadas e que se diferencian a miofibroblasto e c\u00e9lula muscular lisa. De entre \nestes cambios, o m\u00e1is estudado \u00e9 a remodelaci\u00f3n do m\u00fasculo liso, que se considera de importancia \ncentral no mecanismo da hiperreactividade bronquial e a obstruci\u00f3n \u00f3 fluxo a\u00e9reo. \nOs modelos anim\u00e1is de enfermidade experiment al permiten o estudo de mecanismos biol\u00f3xicos \nde enfermidade cun detalle e profundidade non posible en suxeitos humanos. Os modelos anim\u00e1is de asma experimental contribu\u00edron a unha mellor comprensi\u00f3n e tratamento da enfermidade en \nhumanos. A especie m\u00e1is amplamente usada para modela-la asma experimental \u00e9 o rato, tanto por \nreproducires a maior\u00eda dos rasgos patol\u00f3xicos da enfermidade humana como polo seu baixo coste e \nf\u00e1cil manexo. A fisiopatolox\u00eda da asma foi amplamen te estudada en modelos de asma experimental APPENDIX \n 217 basadosen sensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal a ant\u00edxenos  xunto con adxuvantes seguido de provocaci\u00f3n \nco ant\u00edxeno na v\u00eda a\u00e9rea. Este procedemento re produce con intensidade a maior\u00eda dos signos da \nenfermidade asm\u00e1tica, tales como a hiperreact ividade bronquial e remodelaci\u00f3n de v\u00edas \nrespiratorias, a trav\u00e9s dunha resposta al\u00e9rxica tipo Th2 con elevados niveis de IgE. Sen embargo, \nesta estratexia experimental non representa o xeito real no que os humanos desarroian asma e rinitis \nal\u00e9rxica por sensibilizaci\u00f3n e exposici \u00f3n \u00f3s aero-al\u00e9rxenos, e poden ex istir diferenzas relevantes nos \nmecanismos biol\u00f3xicos subxacentes. De feito, o cont acto directo da mucosa do  tracto respiratorio co \nant\u00edxeno alerx\u00e9nico \u00e9, cunha grande posibilidade, esencial para a funci\u00f3n do sistema inmunitario innato, e interacci\u00f3ns a este nivel poden determinar a conseguinte re sposta inmunitaria, en termos \nde ataque ou tolerancia. \u00c9 altamente probable que os modelos de asma al\u00e9rxica experimental \nbasados en sensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal salten un pa so crucial para entende res a fisiopatolox\u00eda da \nasma. Polo tanto, modelos anim\u00e1is basados en exposici\u00f3n primaria a ant\u00edxeno na v\u00eda a\u00e9rea, sen \nsensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal tipo \u201cvacina\u201d, poden  te-lo potencial de reflexar dun modo m\u00e1is \nintegral o desarroio da asma al\u00e9rxica, por mor de involucra-las v\u00edas inmunorreguladoras que os \nmodelos basados en sensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal  poden errar en refl exar. En ditas v\u00edas \ninmunorreguladoras, poden estar implicadas c\u00e9lulas T con funci\u00f3n reguladora (c\u00e9lulas Treg). Dende \na descrici\u00f3n no 2003 do factor de transcrici\u00f3n FOXP3 como respons\u00e1bel do fenotipo regulador de \nc\u00e9lulas T CD4\n+, te\u00f1en sido descritos diversos tipos de c\u00e9lulas T con fenotipo regulador. A\u00ednda que \nna actualidade \u00e9 xeralmente aceptado que non t \u00f3dalas c\u00e9lulas con fenotipo regulador expresan \nFOXP3, a detecci\u00f3n deste marcador contin\u00faa sendo un instrumento de gran utilidade no estudo da \nfunci\u00f3n inmunorreguladora levada a cabo por c\u00e9lulas T CD4+. \nA todo isto hai que engadir que a v\u00eda a\u00e9rea superior foi extensamente ignorada nos modelos \nanim\u00e1is de asma experimental. Recentemente, de senvolveuse a teor\u00eda da \u201cv\u00eda a\u00e9rea \u00fanica\u201d, que \npostula que a asma e a rinitis son d\u00faas manifestaci\u00f3ns diferentes dunha misma enfermidade, en d\u00faas \npartes dunha v\u00eda a\u00e9rea com\u00fan. A\u00ednda que esta teor \u00eda \u00e9 criticada por seres excesivamente simplista, \nexiste evidencia dunha asociaci\u00f3n entre rinitis al\u00e9rxica e asma, e dunha relaci\u00f3n biol\u00f3xica e \ninmunol\u00f3xica entre a mucosa da v\u00eda a\u00e9rea superior, e a de v\u00edas respiratorias intrapulmonares. \nPor todo elo, no presente traballo de tese doutoral propux\u00e9monos desenvolver un modelo \nintegrado de rinitis al\u00e9rxica e asma basado en exposici\u00f3n primaria antix\u00e9nica en v\u00eda respiratoria, e estudar neste modelo a existencia de mecanismos de inmunorregulaci\u00f3n acoplados \u00e1 resposta \nefectora xeradora da asma, e \u00e1 posible impli caci\u00f3n das c\u00e9lulas Treg no  desenvolvemento da \nenfermidade. Adicionalmente, para engadir un valo r traslacional b\u00e1sico-cl\u00ednico \u00f3s datos obtidos nos \nmodelos anim\u00e1is, realizamod an\u00e1lises en biopsias bronquiais humanas. Summary \n 218 Para explora-la resposta \u00e1 sensibilizaci\u00f3n al \u00e9rxica na v\u00eda a\u00e9rea, desenvolvemos modelos de \nexposici\u00f3n primaria a OVA na v\u00eda a\u00e9rea mediante instilaci\u00f3n intranasal repetida en r\u00e9xime lunes-\nm\u00e9rcores-venres, en ausencia de adxuvantes inm unol\u00f3xicos, con recollida e datos e estudo en tres \npuntos de tempo diferentes: (i) un punto temper\u00e1n exploratorio de enfermidade m\u00ednima ou \nincipiente (tres instilaci\u00f3ns, denominado modelo 3IN) ; (ii) un punto de intervalo de tempo dende a \nprimeira exposici\u00f3n antix\u00e9nica equivalente a un modelo cl\u00e1sico de sensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal \n(10 instilaci\u00f3ns, denominado modelo 10 IN, que  foi comparado co modelo de sensibilizaci\u00f3n \nintraperitoneal -IP-); e (iii) un modelo prolong ado para explorar se o grado de enfermidade \nreflectido no modelo 10IN reforzar\u00edase, alcanzar\u00eda un plateau  ou atenuar\u00edase se a exposici\u00f3n \nantix\u00e9nica intranasal se extendese (30 instilaci \u00f3ns, modelo 30IN). No modelo de sensibilizaci\u00f3n \nintraperitoneal, os anim\u00e1is amosaron, tras tres bronco-provocaci\u00f3n s intranas\u00e1is: hiperreactividade \nbronquial a metacolina, infiltraci\u00f3n leucocitaria de predominio eosin\u00f3filo en lavado bronco-\nalveolar, infiltraci\u00f3n inflamatoria eosin\u00f3fila de v\u00edas respiratorias detectada en secci\u00f3ns de tecido \npulmonar e nasal, incremento da presenza de su stancias mucosas en v\u00edas a\u00e9reas superiores e \ninferiores, incremento da masa de m\u00fasculo liso en v\u00edas respiratorias intrapulmonares; e un aumento \nnot\u00e1bel de c\u00e9lulas con expresi\u00f3n de mRNA de Foxp3  con aumento limitado de c\u00e9lulas con \nexpresi\u00f3n de mRNA de Il10 e Tfgb. \nNos modelos de exposici\u00f3n antix \u00e9nica primaria en v\u00eda respirat oria, a reactividade de v\u00edas \nrespiratorias a metacolina resultou atenuada no modelo 10IN respecto do modelo IP, e disminu\u00edu do \nmodelo 30IN. Os tres modelos de exposici\u00f3n antix\u00e9nimca primaria na v\u00eda a\u00e9rea presentan un \naumento de c\u00e9lulas totais en lavado bronco-alveolar con predominancia de linfocitos. Os modelos \n10IN e 30IN amosaron infiltrado inflamatorio pulm onar con presenza de eosin\u00f3filos, pero atenuado \nrespecto do modelo IP, e cunha viraxe do recont o diferencial a predominio linfocitario. Sen \nembargo, o infiltrado inflamatorio na mucosa nasal foi comparable \u00f3 do modelo IP, excepto no \nmodelo 3IN, no que non se apreciou un aumento respecto do grupo control. No que respecta \u00e1 \nproducci\u00f3n de sustancias mucosas, os intranas\u00e1is amosaron un aumento progresivo da resposta \nmucoide no epitelio nasal, dende as 3 instilaci\u00f3ns ate as 30, sendo neste \u00faltimo modelo comparable \n\u00f3 obtido no modelo IP. Pola contra, a resposta mucoide no pulm\u00f3n, a\u00ednd a que aumentada respecto \ndos gruops control tras 3, 10 e 30 instilaci\u00f3ns, resultou atenuada respecto do modelo IP. No concernete \u00e1 deposici\u00f3n de matriz extracelular, tr as 3 instilaci\u00f3ns intranas \u00e1is non se apreciaron \ndiferenzas significativas respecto do grupo control nin do modelo IP; sen embargo, s\u00ed se apreciou \nfibrose subepitelial tras 10 e 30 instilaci\u00f3ns intranas\u00e1is, o que suxire que a fibrose subepitelial \u00e9 un \nfen\u00f3meno progresivo coa duraci\u00f3n da enfermidade. A masa de m\u00fasculo liso resultou incrementada, APPENDIX \n 219 pero de forma atenuada, no modelo 30IN, de forma concomitante \u00e1 atenuaci\u00f3n observada na \nhiperreactividade bronquial. A obtenci\u00f3n dunha resposta al\u00e9rxica con m\u00e1ximo atenuado e \nsubseguinte declive nos modelos intranas\u00e1is, en comparaci\u00f3n co modelo de sensibilizaci\u00f3n \nintraperitoneal como comparador  de capacidade de resposta m\u00e1xima, suxire que a exposici\u00f3n \nprimaria antix\u00e9nica en v\u00eda respir atoria, tal e coma ocorre na adquisici\u00f3n natural de enfermidade \nhumana, activan mecanismos inmunorreguladores.  A evidencia deste brazo inmunorregulador, \nreflectido na atenuaci\u00f3n da inflamaci\u00f3n e da hiperreactividade de v\u00edas respiratorias, conduciunos a \nexplorar un posible papel de c\u00e9lulas Treg. Debi do a dificultades t\u00e9cnicas para a detecci\u00f3n de \nprote\u00edna FOXP3 en tecido de rato fixado con formalina, analizamos a expresi\u00f3n de mRNA de \nFoxp3  nestes modeloes, xunto coa expresi\u00f3n de mRNA de Il10 e Tgfb, d\u00faas citocinas directamente \nrelacionadas coa funci\u00f3n das c\u00e9lulas Treg. Esta s an\u00e1lises, realizadas mediante hibridaci\u00f3n in situ  \nsobre secci\u00f3ns de tecido pulmonar, lev\u00e1ronnos \u00e1 deteccion nos infilitrados inflamatorios dun \naumento progresisvo na cantidade de c\u00e9lulas que expresavan Foxp3 , Il10 e Tgfb hasta acadares os \nseus m\u00e1ximos niveis no modelo 30IN. A cantidade de c\u00e9lulas con expresi\u00f3n de Il10 e Tgfb foi \ncomparable \u00f3 observado no modelo de sensibili zaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal. Sen embargo, a cantidade de \nc\u00e9lulas con expresi\u00f3n de Foxp3  no modelo IP foi desproporcin adamente elevada, suxerindo a \npresenza de c\u00e9lulas Foxp3  sen funcionalidade inmunorreguladora. \nEstes datos amosaron que a expo sici\u00f3n primaria a ant\u00edxeno na v\u00eda a\u00e9rea en ausencia de \nsensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal ou ad xuvantes induce rinitis al\u00e9rxica qu e progresa durante o periodo \nde exposici\u00f3n \u00f3 ant\u00edxeno, e asma experimental atenuada que se modula como resultado da \nexposici\u00f3n continuada. Esta modulaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 asociada cun aumento dos n\u00fameros de c\u00e9lulas \nlinfoides qeu expresan Foxp3 , Il10 e Tgfb nos infiltrados inflamatorios pulmonares, o que suxire \nmecansimos de inmunorregulaci\u00f3n activa que os mode los basados en sensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal \nerran en reflectir. Os resultados obtidos nesta primeira parte do traballo de investigaci\u00f3n doutoral \namosaron que a exposici\u00f3n primaria e continua da a ant\u00edxeno nas v\u00edas respiratorias induce a \nactivaci\u00f3n dun brazo inmunorregulador que resulta na atenuaci\u00f3n dos rasgos da asma al\u00e9rxica \nexperimental, pero non da rinitis al\u00e9rxica, suxerindo adem\u00e1is un papel importante de c\u00e9lulas Treg \nproductoras de IL10 e TGFB. Este conxunto de datos foi tam\u00e9n consistente coa hip\u00f3tese de que a \ninteracci\u00f3n do al\u00e9rxeno coa mucosa da v\u00eda resp iratoria no momento da exposici\u00f3n antix\u00e9nica \nprimaria \u00e9 crucial, mediante a probable participaci\u00f3n do sistema inmunitario innato, para defini-lo \nperfil de resposta subseguinte a cargo do sistema inmunitario adaptativo. As\u00ed pois, na seguinte parte \ndo traballo propux\u00e9monos demostra-lo papel de c\u00e9lulas T efectoras CD4+ e c\u00e9lulas T reguladoras \nCD4+ na asma experimental. Summary \n 220 Para estuda-lo papel das c\u00e9lulas T CD4+ efectoras e reguladoras, realizamos experimentos de \ntransferencia adoptiva nos modelos de exposici\u00f3n an tix\u00e9nica na v\u00eda a\u00e9rea. Coa finalidade de realizar \nseguimento in vivo  das c\u00e9lulas transferidas, procedemos \u00e1 s\u00faa modificaci\u00f3n xen\u00e9ti ca para introducir \na expresi\u00f3n permantente dunha variante de prote\u00edna verde fluorescente (GFP). A expansi\u00f3n clonal \nde c\u00e9lulas T activadas representa o ciclo celul ar m\u00e1is r\u00e1pido co\u00f1ecido entre as c\u00e9lulas de \norganismos pluricelular es. Dada a necesidade de conseguire s a modificaci\u00f3n xen\u00e9tica permantente \ndas c\u00e9lulas diana e da s\u00faa proxenie, decant\u00e1monos po la transducci\u00f3n retroviral  usando vectores de \ntipo retroviral que, trala s\u00faa retrotranscripci\u00f3n, int\u00e9granse de modo permanente no xenoma das c\u00e9lulas transducidas, e con elo o cDNA de interese subclonado no vector. Para elo, estes vectores \naproveitan a ausencia de envoltura nuclear durante a mitose (metafase e anafase) para integrarse no \nxenoma celular e orixinar expresi\u00f3n constitutiva.  Esta caracter\u00edstica, combinada coa estimulaci\u00f3n in \nvitro  de c\u00e9lulas T efectoras ant\u00edxeno-espec\u00edficas  obtidas de donantes sensibilizados a un \ndeterminado ant\u00edxeno, resulta nun m\u00e9todo efi caz para a transducci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas T efectoras \nant\u00edxeno-espec\u00edficas, dado que o tipo de vector de  transferencia x\u00e9nica usado soamente transduce \nc\u00e9lulas en ciclo celular activo, e \u00fanicamente as c\u00e9lulas T CD4\n+ ant\u00edxeno-espec\u00edficas entran en ciclo \ncelular cando a poboaci\u00f3n de esplenocitos dun animal sensibilizado exponse \u00f3 ant\u00edxeno  in vitro . \nTralo dese\u00f1o e construcci\u00f3n do vector retroviral de transferencia x\u00e9nica para inducir expresi\u00f3n \npermantente de GFP, \u00f3 que denominamos como pMSCV-GFP por derivarse dun Murine Stem Cell \nVirus , procedemos a xerar mediante transducc\u00f3n e separaci\u00f3n por citometr\u00eda de fluxo c\u00e9lulas T \nCD4+GFP+ efectoras, coas que realizamos un modelo de  asma experimental basado en transferencia \nadoptiva destas c\u00e9lulas a anim\u00e1is receptores sinx\u00e9 nicos non sensibilizados, e posterior instilaci\u00f3n \nintranasal do ant\u00edxeno (OVA) no s anim\u00e1is receptores. Neste modelo, propux\u00e9monos titular o \nn\u00famero m\u00ednimo de c\u00e9lulas T CD4+ ant\u00edxeno espec\u00edficas efectoras necesario para inducir \nhiperreactividade e inflamaci\u00f3n de v\u00edas respiratorias, baixo a hip\u00f3tese de que cantidades moi \npequenas destas c\u00e9lulas ser\u00eda sufi cientes. Os ratos receptores fo ron instilados d\u00faas veces con OVA \nantes da transferencia adoptiva e tres veces tras el a (5 instilaci\u00f3ns intranas\u00e1is), en forma dun modelo \ncurto para previr un posible solapamento coa desposta inmunitaria adaptativa que o h\u00f3spede poder\u00eda \ndesenvolver. Realizamos series de titulaci\u00f3n, que amosaron que a transferencia adoptiva de 105 \nc\u00e9lulas T efectoras CD4+ OVA-espec\u00edficas \u00e9 abondo para in ducir hiperreactividade bronquial a \nmetacolina, incremento de c\u00e9lulas totais no la vado bronco-alveolar e inflamaci\u00f3n da v\u00eda a\u00e9rea \nevidente na an\u00e1lise histopatol\u00f3xica do teci do pulmonar, onde se detectaron c\u00e9lulas GFP+. Estes \ndatos indicaron que pequenos n\u00fameros de c\u00e9lulas efectoras T CD4+ ant\u00edxeno-espec\u00edficas te\u00f1en a APPENDIX \n 221 capacidade de migrar \u00e1s v\u00edas respiratorias e dirixir a inflamaci\u00f3n nunha resposta inmunitaria \nadaptativa al\u00e9rxica. \nNo segundo modelo de transferencia adoptiva, propux\u00e9monos comproba-lo efecto da \ntransferencia de c\u00e9lulas Treg nun modelo de asma experimental con enfermidade establecida, \ninducido neste caso por exposici\u00f3n primaria na v\u00ed a a\u00e9rea a extracto estandarizado de \u00e1caros de po \n(house dust mite , en adiante HDM). Para as finalidades deste experimento xer\u00e1ronse c\u00e9lulas T \nreguladoras CD4+ in vitro  mediante transducci\u00f3n retroviral dun xeito similar \u00e1 obtenci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas \nT efectoras CD4+ descrita anteriormete, pero a partires de dontantes sensibilizados a HDM. Neste \ncaso constru\u00eduse un vector retroviral bici str\u00f3nico que cont\u00e9n as secuencias de Foxp3  e gfp separadas \npor unha secuencia interna de entrada ribosomal (un internal ribosomal entry site , en adiante IRES), \nvector \u00f3 que nomeamos pRetroFOXP3-IRES-GFP. Este vector induce a ex presi\u00f3n simult\u00e1nea de \nFOXP3 e GFP nas c\u00e9lulas tr ansducidas, de xeito que a detecci\u00f3n  de GFP permite a identificaci\u00f3n de \nc\u00e9lulas FOXP3+. A expresi\u00f3n forzada de FOXP3 xerada deste modo en c\u00e9lulas T CD4+ activadas \ninduce funci\u00f3n reguladora nestas c\u00e9lulas, \u00e9 dicir, xera c\u00e9lulas Treg. Adem\u00e1is, as c\u00e9lulas Treg \nxeradas deste xeito son ant\u00edxeno-espec\u00edficas. Os  anim\u00e1is receptores foro n instilados con HDM un \ntotla de 28 veces \u00f3 largo de 40 d\u00edas de duraci\u00f3n  do modelo. No grupo receptor de transferencia \nadoptiva, 75.000 c\u00e9lulas Treg foron inxectadas na vena da cola antes da finalizaci\u00f3n das instilaci\u00f3ns \nintranas\u00e1is (na instilaci\u00f3n 24, d\u00eda 31). Neste experimento piloto (n =4 por grupo), a transferencia \nadoptiva de tan s\u00f3 estas 75.000 c\u00e9lulas Treg xeradas in vitro  provocou unha modesta reduci\u00f3n nos \ninfiltrados inflamatorios en tecido pulmonar, sen modificar significativamente os recontos de \nc\u00e9lulas tot\u00e1is no lavado bronco-alveolar, e observouse tam\u00e9n unha atenuaci\u00f3n da hiperreactividade \nde v\u00edas respiratorias, prob\u00e1ndos e mediante detecci\u00f3n de GFP que as c\u00e9lulas transferidas estaban \npresentes nos infiltrados inflamatorios na s v\u00edas respiratorias intrapulmonares. \nComo derradeiro obxectivo e cun efoque trasl acional, propux\u00e9monos explora-la aplicabilidade \ndos datos obtidos nos modelos anim\u00e1is \u00e1 enfermidad e humana. Os datos sobre c\u00e9lulas Treg na asma \nhumana est\u00e1n nunha fase moi inicial e os resultados neste sentido son limitados e inconsistentes. A \ntotalidade dos escasos traballos realizados sobre c\u00e9lulas Treg na asma humana centr\u00e1ronse na \ndetecci\u00f3n destas c\u00e9lulas en sang ue perif\u00e9rica ou lavado bronco-alveolar, pero ata o de agora non \nexisten estudos sobre tecido pulmonar. Tendo en conta esta carencia, propux\u00e9monos estuda-la presenza de c\u00e9lulas FOXP3\n+ mediante inmunohistoqu\u00edmica en biopsias bronquiais de doentes con \nasma grave e comparalos con suxeitos control.  Atopamos que as c\u00e9lulas reguladoras CD4+ est\u00e1n \npr\u00e1cticamente ausentes en biopsias de suxeitos cont rol. Pola contra, as biopsias de doentes con asma \ngrave amosaron una presenza significativa de c\u00e9lulas FOXP3+ infiltrando principalmente zonas de Summary \n 222 tecido conectivo laxo subepitelial. Este aumentde c\u00e9lulas FOXP3+ en biopsias bronquiais de \npacientes con asma grave suxire un papel da inmunorregulaci\u00f3n mediada pro c\u00e9lulas Treg, e \u00e9 \nadem\u00e1is consistente cos datos derivados de modelos anim\u00e1is. O noso conxunto de datos xerados a \npartires de asma experimental e investigaci\u00f3n cl\u00edn ica suxire que as c\u00e9lulas Treg est\u00e1n aumentadas \nna parede das v\u00edas respiratorias na asma, proba blemente de forma reactiva \u00e1 inflamaci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica \nque subxace \u00e1 enfermidade. Se as c\u00e9lulas FOXP3+ observadas nas biopsias bronquiais humanas son \nfuncionalmente competentes como c\u00e9lulas Treg ou non, \u00e9 desconocido neste punto e, polo tanto, son \nnecesarios novos estudos que as car actericen de xeito m\u00e1is extenso en suxeitos asm\u00e1ticos. O erro en \nresolve-la inflamaci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica das v\u00edas respirator ias na asma ten con toda probabilidade una causa \ncomplexa multifactorial, en non implica necesariamente unha diferenc ia na funci\u00f3n ou reclutamento \nde c\u00e9lulas Terg. \nDos resultados obtidos no presente traballo  de tese doutora p\u00f3dese conclu\u00edr que:  \n- A exposici\u00f3n primaria na v\u00eda a\u00e9rea e a provo caci\u00f3n continuada con ant\u00edxeno, a diferenza da \nsensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal seguida de provo caci\u00f3n intranasal, induce asma experimental \natenuada con disminuci\u00f3n da hiperreactividade das v\u00edas respiratorias, hipersecreci\u00f3n de moco e \nlixeiro aumento da masa de m\u00fasculo liso. Pola contra, a fibrose subepitelial aumenta \nprogresivamente e os infiltrados inflamatorios xiran cara un predominio linfocitario. \n- Trala exposici\u00f3n primaria a ant\u00edxeno na v\u00eda a\u00e9rea,  prod\u00facese unha hipertrofia e hiperplasia de \nc\u00e9lulas caliciformes, tanto en v\u00eda a\u00e9rea superior coma v\u00edas a\u00e9reas respiratorias inferiores, nun \nestpacio de tempo insuficiente para o desenvolvemento dunha resposta inmunitaria adaptativa. Esta \nresposta mucosa temper\u00e1 poder\u00eda se-lo resultado  da acci\u00f3n de mecanismos do sistema inmune \ninnato. \n- Na mucosa nasal, tanto a exposici\u00f3n primaria  a ant\u00edxeno na v\u00eda a\u00e9rea coma a sensibilizaci\u00f3n \nintraperitoneal previa, inducen rinitis al\u00e9rxica c on infiltraci\u00f3n eosinof\u00edlica, hiperplasia de c\u00e9lulas \ncaliciformes e aumento da produci\u00f3n de moco. \u00d3 contrario das manifestaci\u00f3ns da asma \nexperimental, a exposici\u00f3n primaria a ant\u00edxeno na v\u00eda a\u00e9rea seguido de provocaci\u00f3n continuada \nprovoca un aumento progresivo da intensidade da rinitis al\u00e9rxica co tempo. \n- Trala exposici\u00f3n primara a ant\u00edxenon na v\u00ed a a\u00e9rea seguida de provocaci\u00f3n intranasal \ncontinuada, a atenuaci\u00f3n da maior parte das caracter \u00edsticas da asma experimental, a progresi\u00f3n da \nfibrose subepitelial e a viraxe cara infiltrados predominantemente linfocitarios est\u00e1n asociados \ncunha progresiva presenza no infiltrado inflam atorio de c\u00e9lulas que expresan mRNA de Foxp3 , Il10 \ne Tgfb. A sensibilizaci\u00f3n intraperitoneal ten coma c onsecuencia un aumento a n\u00f3malo de c\u00e9lulas que APPENDIX \n 223 expresan mRNA de Foxp3  no infiltrado inflamatorio, pero que non se correlaciona cun aumento \nconcordante na transcripci\u00f3n de Il10 e Tgfb. \n- C\u00e9lulas T CD4+ efectoras ant\u00edxeno-espec\u00edficas dirixen o reclutamento de c\u00e9lulas inflamatorias \ne a hiperreactividade de v\u00edas respiratorias tral a provocaci\u00f3n antix\u00e9nica. Estas c\u00e9lulas, nesta \ncantidade, son capaces de migrar \u00e1s v\u00edas resp iratorias e provoca-los efectos mencionados. \n-C\u00e9lulas T efectoras CD4+ ant\u00edxeno-espec\u00edficas con expresi\u00f3n forzada de FOXP3 act\u00faan como \nc\u00e9lulas Treg in vivo  e modulan a hiperreactividade e inflamaci \u00f3n de v\u00edas respiratorias en modelos \nanim\u00e1is con asma experimental establecida. Estas c\u00e9lulas, en escaso n\u00famero, son capaces de migrar \n\u00e1s v\u00edas respiratorias e provoca-los efectos mencionados. \n- Existe un aumento significativo na presenza de linfocitos FOXP3+ en biopsias bronquiais de \npacientes con asma grave en comparaci\u00f3n con suxeitos control. Este aumento pode reflectir un \nincremento de c\u00e9lulas Treg  reacivo \u00e1 inflamaci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica. ", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
