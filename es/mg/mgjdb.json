Arnson and Eric L. Olson1\n \nIn early May 2011, dozens of gunmen entered a farm in Guatemala\u2019s \nPet\u00e9n region, murdering and decapitating 27 people. Guatemalan \nauthorities as well as speculation in the press have blamed the \nZetas, a violent Mexican drug trafficking cartel increasingly active in Guatemala and other parts of Central America\n2. Whether a vengeance \nkilling following the murder of a presumed drug lord, or a struggle amongst the Zetas and Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa cartel for the control of territory \nand smuggling routes, the massacre underscores the vulnerability of \nthe civilian population in unsecured border areas between Mexico \nand Guatemala, where narcotics and human trafficking flourish.  In \nresponse, the government of President \u00c1lvaro Colom declared a state of \nsiege similar to the one declared from December 2010-February 2011 in the department of Alta Verapaz.\nThis incident and others like it underscore the serious threat to \ndemocratic governance, human rights, and the rule of law posed by \norganized crime in Central America. The international community has \nbegun to address the burgeoning crisis and commit significant resources \nto the fight against crime and violence; indeed, not since the Central \nAmerican wars of the 1980s-1980s has the region commanded so much attention in the international arena.   \nTo better understand the nature, origins, and evolution of organized \ncrime in Central America, and thereby contribute to the efforts of policy-\nmakers and civil society to address it, the Latin American Program \ncommissioned a series of case studies that looked at the countries of the \nso-called Northern Triangle\u2014El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras\u2014\nand at the broader regional context affecting national dynamics. Our interest was to understand more fully how organized crime has evolved \nin Central America, and to examine the links between organized crime \nand traffickers in Central America, Mexico and Colombia. What role \ndoes Central America play in the supply chain for illegal goods between Cynthia J. Arnson and Eric L. Olson| 2 |the Andes and the United States, and how have trafficking organizations \nfrom these areas related to one another over time?  \nThe growing presence and activities of organized crime groups in \nCentral America has worsened an already alarming crisis of citizen \nsecurity.  In mid- 2010, the Inter-American Commission on Human \nRights reported that Latin America had the highest levels of youth \nviolence in the world3. UN figures indicate that the rate of youth \nhomicide in Latin America is more than double that of Africa, and 36 times the rate of developed countries\n4. An oft-referenced study by the \nUnited Nations Development Program (UNDP) noted in 2009 that the seven countries of Central America\u2014Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, \nGuatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama\u2014register the highest \nlevels of non-political violence in the world; this observation has been \nechoed in statements by the U.S. Department of Defense\n5. The situation \nis most acute in the countries of the Northern Triangle6. In El Salvador \nalone, sixty-eight percent of homicide victims are between the ages of \nfifteen and thirty-four, and nine out of ten victims are male7. Countries \nsuch as Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Belize are also witnessing rising rates of insecurity associated with the increased presence of organized crime. \nA 2011 study published by the World Bank helps to put the numbers \nin context: although the combined population of Central America is \nequivalent to that of Spain, in 2006, Spain registered a total of 336 \nmurders, while the corresponding number in Central America was \n14,257\n8. Grim as they are, murder rates in Central America capture only \nthe most extreme form of violent crime, which also includes assault, \nrobbery, and domestic violence. Indeed, with respect to youth violence, \nthe United Nations estimated in 2010 that for every fatality, there were \n20-40 victims of non-fatal violence9. \nDrug Trafficking Has Exacerbated Already High \nLevels of Violence\nCrime and violence in Central America have multiple drivers, but none \nappears more responsible for the dramatic increase in violence than the \nillegal drug trade.  The World Bank noted in 2011 that drug trafficking \nconstitutes \u201cthe main single factor behind rising levels of violence in the Introduction| 3 |region,\u201d indicating that crime rates are more than 100 percent higher \nin drug trafficking \u201chot spots\u201d than in other areas.  Crime and violence \ncause trauma and suffering for individuals as well as communities; \nthey also have become a serious development issue, with \u201cstaggering \neconomic costs\u201d at the national level.10   \nThe growing activity of organized crime groups in Central America, \nparticularly drug traffickers, takes advantage of the region\u2019s weak \nand fragile institutions as well as its geographical proximity to North \nAmerican drug markets.  While there is significant variation among \nthe countries of the region, in most cases dysfunctional judicial systems \nhave long fostered high levels of impunity and corruption.  Processes of \npolice reform and professionalization in the wake of peace settlements in Guatemala and El Salvador have been\u2014to put it generously\u2014\nincomplete.  The region\u2019s porous land borders and extensive coastlines \nare not adequately controlled, making them vulnerable to exploitation \nby criminal groups. Additional factors include high levels of youth \nunemployment,\n10 inadequate educational opportunities, particularly \nat the secondary level,12 and an abundance of illegal light as well as \nheavy-caliber weapons (reflecting inadequate programs of post-war \ndisarmament and reintegration as well as illegal weapons flows from the \nUnited States).\nCriminal networks\u2014including some originating during the era \nof internal armed conflict\u2014have operated in Central America for \ndecades (moving drugs, contraband, arms, and human beings).  But \nMexican organized crime groups have also increased their presence in \nCentral America:  as competition for control of territory has intensified \nin Mexico, these groups have expanded their illegal activities into contiguous territories, and are also now heavily involved in immigrant \nsmuggling.\n13 An additional factor putting pressure on Central America \nis that U.S. and Mexican authorities have succeeded in limiting drug flights from South America into Mexican territory; as a result, more \nclandestine flights are now routed through the Northern Triangle.\n14  \nFigures from the State Department paint an especially stark portrait.  \nThe State Department\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement estimated that in 2008, 42 percent of the cocaine \nentering the United States transited Central America directly from South \nAmerica.  By 2010, the estimate of the amount of cocaine smuggled to | 4 |the United States through Central America had jumped to 60 percent \nof the total.15 This dramatic increase over a two-year period represents \na major shift in trafficking patterns, and Guatemala and Honduras play \npivotal roles in these networks. Admiral James Winnefeld, head of the \nU.S. Northern Command, recently told the United States Congress that \nnearly all the cocaine destined for the United States crosses the Mexico-\nGuatemala border.16 Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Honduras Hugo \nLlorens similarly estimated that approximately 42 percent of cocaine \nflights leaving South America for other parts of the world go through \nHonduras.17.\nCentral America is a classic representation of the unrelenting dynamic \nof the drug trade over the past several decades in which improvements in one country or sub-region translate into deterioration elsewhere.  The \n\u201cballoon effect\u201d usually describes the phenomenon by which reductions \nin illegal drug activity in one country lead to increases in another.  But \nthe balloon effect is much more pernicious; all aspects of organized \ncrime\u2014from cultivation of drugs to production to all forms of illegal trafficking\u2014constantly change shape as traffickers adapt to changing and \npersistent levels of demand and corresponding levels of profit increased \ncompetition from rival gangs, and increased enforcements.  Central \nAmerica is paying a heavy price because of this constantly shifting \nscenario.\nIn the report\u2019s first chapter, \u201cDrug Trafficking Organizations in \nCentral America: Transportistas , Mexican Cartels, and Maras,\u201d Stephen \nS. Dudley provides an overview of drug trafficking activities in Central \nAmerica dating back to the 1970s. Dudley describes the ever changing \ndynamics within the international drug trafficking business during the \n70s and 80s and examines how these changes have affected Central \nAmerica.  He argues that successful international efforts to disrupt \nColombian trafficking routes through the Caribbean and Miami, along \nwith the demise of the Cali and Medell\u00edn cartels in the 1980s, made Central America a strategically important area for the international \ndrug trade because of its geography, the existing criminal networks \nwith experience moving contraband and laundering money, and the \nabundance of weapons from the region\u2019s many armed conflicts.\nDudley also examines the nature and role of local smuggling and \ncontraband networks that cropped up in Central America during Cynthia J. Arnson and Eric L. OlsonIntroduction| 5 |the armed conflicts that ravaged the region in the 1970s and \u201880s and \nthat continued into the post-war demobilization period when many \ncombatants were suddenly idled. These criminal networks, known locally \nas transportistas  (transporters), developed sophisticated transportation \nroutes and took advantage of weakened state institutions that enabled them to move almost any product, including illegal drugs, and to engage \nin human trafficking from south to north and into the hands of larger \nMexican organizations.  \nDudley\u2019s chapter also explores the role played by Mexican criminal \norganizations as they became increasingly important players in the transnational drug trafficking business\u2014displacing Colombian \norganizations as the primary traffickers through the region.  Mexican \norganizations have historically maintained a foothold in Central \nAmerica, but their presence has continued to expand as Central America \nbecomes a more important transshipment point between the Andes and Mexico.  According to the U.S. government, an estimated half of the \nillicit drugs entering the United States through Mexico stop first in \nCentral America.  Central America is within reach of drug-laden go-fast \nboats leaving the Andes.\nDudley also begins to dissect the complex relationship between \nyouth gangs, known as maras  in Central America, and drug trafficking \norganizations in Central America, Colombia and Mexico.  Although \nthese groups are sometimes lumped together, Dudley maintains that the \nmaras  are a separate phenomenon that, at times, overlap and cooperate \nwith organized crime networks by providing security or helping to move product.  The maras  also become recruitment arenas for organized \ncrime in some cases.\nIn his chapter, \u201cOrganized Crime in El Salvador: The Homegrown \nand Transnational Dimensions,\u201d Douglas Farah  expands on some of \nthe themes identified by Dudley.  He notes that organized crime in Central America is best understood within a post-conflict context that \nmakes these countries particularly vulnerable to criminal activity.  In \nEl Salvador, for example, some Cold War networks that were formed \nto transport weapons and people during the country\u2019s internal armed \nconflict survived the peace process and evolved into criminal entities after \nthe armed conflict had ended.  Leaders of El Salvador\u2019s current criminal groups tend to be former members of the security forces or ex-FMLN | 6 |Cynthia J. Arnson and Eric L. Olson\ncombatants, even though approximately 95-98 percent of combatants \ndemobilized in good faith at the end of the conflict. Nevertheless, a small \nnumber of individuals with combat training continued to operate with \naccess to pre-existing transnational networks and possessing automatic \nweapons that exceeded those of the police. They have evolved into \nclandestine networks that remain deeply entrenched in El Salvadoran \nsociety and now form the basis for organized crime.  \nThe transformation of ideological groups into criminal actors was \nfacilitated, in part, by their access to \u201cwartime structures and tactics,\u201d including intelligence and smuggling routes. This has led Mexican and \nColombian organizations to take advantage of El Salvador\u2019s position and \nuse it as a \u201cpipeline\u201d where trafficked items, such as cocaine, migrants and \ncash, can be inserted into the trafficking stream at different \u201cnodes\u201d and \nthen reliably delivered on the other side of the border. As a result, most \nof the organizations that participate in drug-trafficking in El Salvador are tasked primarily with protection and transportation of Colombian \nor Mexican-owned products. One example of this relationship is the \nSinaloa cartel\u2019s (Mexico) reliance on Los Perrones Orientales , an organized \ncrime group that transports product by land from the Pacific Coast to Guatemala. At least one police official believes that Los Perrones Orientales  \naspire to \u201cbecome mini Mexican cartels.\u201d Indeed, Farah noted that they frequently emulate the extravagant and risky lifestyles of the Mexican cartel members through activities like car and horse racing, and narco-\ncorridas , or musical tributes to their work.  \nA third element of the organized crime structures in El Salvador are \nyouth gangs.  While the gangs are not generally believed to have been \ncompletely subsumed by organized crime, there is evidence that upper \nechelons of transnational youth gangs, such as the Mara Salvatrucha  (MS-\n13), provide security, or \u201cmuscle,\u201d for the Mexican cartels and frequently \nprovide transport services for organizations like Los Perrones Orientales .  \nThese upper levels are often made up of former combatants and there is evidence that Mexico\u2019s Zetas  are attempting to recruit senior gang \nleaders because of their \u201ccontacts, markets and security arrangements\u201d in the United States that the Zetas  would otherwise not be able to access. \nConversely, the lower level gang members control a small percentage of drugs received from the cartels and sold locally. Neighborhood cocaine Introduction| 7 |sales, known as narcomenudeo , drive local violence as gangs fight to \ncontrol territory in order to convert cocaine into profit. \nOrganized crime also presents a challenge to nascent institutions and \npolitical structures in El Salvador vulnerable to corruption. Cartels are \nknown to have infiltrated the political leadership in some areas and re-\ndirect resources into local and municipal elections in order to ensure that \nspecific trafficking routes are protected.  Evidence of this corruption is \nseen in the presence of political parties that do not garner widespread public support (less than 5 percent of the vote), but continue to survive \nin certain geographic areas, particularly those that facilitate the entry \nof drugs and contraband into Guatemala. Further, the related flow of \nlaundered money moving between the United States and South America \nthrough El Salvador distorts the economy. That the Salvadoran economy \nis dollarized facilitates this process.  \nThe situation is comparable in Honduras, according to the chapter by \nJames Bosworth, \u201cHonduras: Organized Crime Gained During Political Crisis.\u201d  As in El Salvador and Guatemala, Honduras has experienced \nthe effects of the increasingly violent organized crime in Mexico, \nespecially with respect to illicit trafficking.  In recent years, the country \nhas recorded one of the highest homicide rates in the world, upwards of \n60 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Honduras has also become one of \nthe world\u2019s most dangerous countries for journalists. Nevertheless, what distinguishes Honduras from its Central American neighbors, according \nto Bosworth, is the 2009 coup against President Manuel Zelaya.  The \ncoup diverted the interim government\u2019s attention to matters of state \nsurvival which meant there was less vigilance in combating organized \ncrime and lead to the expansion of organized crime throughout the \ncountry.   \nPrior to the coup, organized crime groups in Honduras were \nprimarily involved in the transport of cocaine northward from Peru or Colombia via air or sea. Once drugs arrived in country, the process was \n\u201cMexicanized\u201d or turned over to either the Sinaloa cartel or the Zetas , \nwhich then moved the product out of the country by land or by sea, respectively. Generally, the planes bringing cocaine into Honduras have \ncrash-landed in remote areas eliminating the need for landing stripes \nand facilitating the destruction of evidence. Additionally, the movement of drugs within Honduras is closely tied to human smuggling with the Cynthia J. Arnson and Eric L. Olson| 8 |Zetas in particular using kidnapped migrants to demand ransoms while \nusing them to also traffic drugs into the United States. \nHonduran officials cite violence at the local level\u2014related to drug \nconsumption and local drug-trafficking\u2014as an additional key concern. \nAccording to Bosworth, Honduras has the largest absolute number of \ngang members in Central America.  While not directly involved in the \ntransnational enterprise itself, as in El Salvador, gangs provide muscle for \nthe Mexican organizations. They have also achieved territorial control in certain neighborhoods of San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa, where \nextortion serves as their primary source of income.  Further, gangs pose \na major challenge to the effectiveness of the country\u2019s prison system. \nPrisoners are often able to coordinate and execute illegal activities from \ninside of the prison, as well as smuggle weapons into the prison. \nIn 2006, newly elected Honduran President Manuel Zelaya pledged to \naddress his country\u2019s crime and especially the gang problem.  Nevertheless, despite these promises crime continued to increase throughout his \nadministration. Bosworth argues that he paid little attention to security, \nopting in the time leading up to the coup to instead focus promoting \na constitutional reform process.  After the coup, the state\u2019s attention \nwas further diverted from the challenges posed by organized crime and \ntoward the crisis of governance. Control of the country\u2019s airspace was \nlost and the security forces were placed on high alert to repress the public protests in support of the deposed President and to prevent Zelaya from \nreentering the country.  At the same time, the international community \nprotested the coup as a threat to Honduran democracy by severing \ndiplomatic ties and cutting off other intelligence resources necessary for \ntracking transnational organized crime.  According to Bosworth, the \nlack of intelligence-sharing diminished the Honduran attorney general\u2019s \nability to track the movements through Honduras of major traffickers like \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. \nAs a result of the sudden loss of resources and information-sharing \ncapabilities, the Honduran government was seriously limited in its \ncapacity to challenge the overwhelming resources at the disposal of \norganized crime groups.  The cartels were able to take advantage of this \nweakness, as demonstrated by the estimated 500-1000 tons of cocaine \nthat moved through the country during the government of interim President Roberto Micheletti. Introduction| 9 |The upward trend appears to have stabilized under current President \nPorfirio Lobo, with the reestablishment of information sharing and the \npriority his administration has given to the security issue.  However, \nLobo\u2019s methods for confronting crime have not led to a reduction in \nhomicide rates and some government opponents are concerned about \nwhat they see as an increase in repression.  For example, Lobo has called \non the military to participate in public security operations, not only in \nhigh-crime urban areas but also in areas with social or political unrest. This has led to accusations that the Lobo government pays little attention \nto human rights and does not differentiate between criminal activity \nand legitimate social movements. In this context, Bosworth warned that \npolitical tensions in the aftermath of the coup could prove debilitating \nfor the fight against organized crime in Honduras. \nIn her chapter on organized crime in Guatemala, Julie L\u00f3pez describes \nthe country as a state fighting two wars: one with organized crime and one with itself. Guatemala, she argues, is confronting a legacy of \ncorruption and impunity rooted in the 36-year internal armed conflict. \nShe emphasizes that organized crime incorporates not only foreign \ncriminal networks and local criminal organizations, but also local \nauthorities\u2014military, police, and civilian. As in El Salvador, the roles \nthese actors played during the country\u2019s civil conflict are an important\u2014\nthough not the only\u2014part of the current dynamic of crime and violence in the country.  According to L\u00f3pez, organized crime in Guatemala was \nsheltered by the armed conflict and grew following the end of the war. \nThe Colombian cartel incursion into Guatemala was ultimately \nfacilitated by military corruption, according to L\u00f3pez.  With the declining \nimportance of Colombia\u2019s cartels in the mid-90s and the changing role \nof Guatemala\u2019s military after the 1996 peace accords moved them out of \nan active combat,  Colombian influence in Guatemala, based primarily on its relationship with the Guatemalan military, declined significantly.  \nIn its place, Mexican cartels entered to fill the vacuum. Now, the Zetas \nhave taken over the northern area of Guatemala\u2019s Huehuetenango \nstate, and the Sinaloa cartel operates mostly in the southern and eastern \nparts of the country.  Of the seven organized crime groups alleged \nto be operating in Guatemala, L\u00f3pez identified two - the Lorenzano \nand Mendoza families - as \u201chistorical anchors\u201d for organized crime in Guatemala. Together, these organizations control drug-trafficking Cynthia J. Arnson and Eric L. Olson| 10 |in Zacapa and Pet\u00e9n, respectively. Their family-oriented structures\u2014\ncomposed of fathers, sons, and sons-in-laws\u2014appear to coexist with the \nMexican cartels and exercise control over territories and populations. \nThe relationships these groups foster at the local level help guarantee \ntheir impunity.  It has been suggested, for example, that the local police \nin Zacapa warn the Lorenzanos of any attempts to arrest them and they \nappear to be supported by their community. \nOrganized crime structures are complicated not only by the \nrelationships they have with the authorities, but also by the diversity of their activities. Guatemalan organized crime groups are linked with \nlocal youth gangs ( maras ) through retail drug markets ( narcomenudeo ) and \nthe trade in advanced weapons. The maras  are reportedly responsible \nfor approximately 48 percent of crime in Guatemala City and estimates \nindicate that between 1.2 and 1.8 million weapons are in use in \nGuatemala.  Violence is exceptionally high compared to the period of the armed conflict. Although only about 10 percent of the cocaine \ntrafficked in the country is for local distribution or consumption, there is \nincreasing violence associated with payment in product for transportation \nand protection services. \nAlmost all institutions\u2014civilian, military, and police\u2014have shown \nsome connection to organized crime and attempts to address this \ncorruption have created unique challenges. Police reform and the transformation of the military\u2019s role with respect to public security are \nmajor areas of focus.  The government\u2019s attempts to demilitarize and \nreform the police coincide with a strategy of militarizing certain parts of \nthe country overtaken by drug-trafficking. In addition, a deeper and more \ncomprehensive police reform is financially impeded by the government\u2019s \ninability to convince the Congress and society to raise taxes.  The public \nsector in Guatemala is also historically weak.  According to L\u00f3pez, this is mainly the result of nepotism and an ineffectual public service law.  \nFurther, it is extremely difficult for the Guatemalan Congress to pass \nlegislation regarding justice and security.  At present, 14 different political \nparties are represented in Congress.  While such a divided Congress \nprevents any single party to control the legislature, it also reflects the \ndifficulty of sustaining policies over time.  L\u00f3pez emphasized the need \nfor reforms that promote continuity of security policies \u201cas opposed to Introduction| 11 |the current practice of quickly wiping away policies when a new official \nis appointed\u2026\u201d  \nThe U.S. Response \nInitially, the U.S. government was slow to respond to the ways that increased counter-drug enforcement throughout the Andes would affect \nMexico and other countries closest to the world\u2019s largest drug market \nin North America.  Central America was initially an afterthought as \nthe United States and Mexico launched Plan M\u00e9rida in 2007-2008.  \nHowever, faced with the deteriorating situation in Central America, \nthe Obama administration has increased its support for the countries of \nCentral America through CARSI, and for the Caribbean through the CBSI.\n18 The goals of CARSI\u2014to reduce the levels of violence, foster \neconomic and social opportunity, prevent the transit of contraband and \ncriminals, expand law enforcement, judicial, social and educational \nopportunities, among others19 \u2014are broad and the Obama administration \nhas embraced an agenda that seeks to combine social prevention policies \nwith efforts to strengthen law enforcement institutions, and has worked \nto coordinate its strategy with other foreign donors and international \ndevelopment banks.\nBetween Fiscal Years 2008 and 2010, Central America was slated to \nreceive $260 million, with an additional $100 million in each of the \nfollowing two fiscal years (FY 2011 and FY 2012).  Despite initial delays, the disbursement of funds appears to have accelerated.  U.S. financial \nsupport to Central America is conditioned by the ongoing financial crisis \nin the United States and reductions in government spending across the \nboard: while a substantial increase over previous years, U.S. assistance to \nCentral America is still tiny when compared to the amounts provided \nduring the years of the Central American wars:  more than $6 billion to \nEl Salvador alone between 1980 and 1992.  Similarly, U.S. assistance to Colombia has totaled $8.699 billion from FY 2000 through FY 2012.\n20 \nMaximizing the use of scarce U.S. resources in a time of shrinking \nbudgets requires close coordination with other donors (including the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, and the agencies \nof the U.N. system) as well as significant cooperation across the multiple Cynthia J. Arnson and Eric L. Olson| 12 |U.S. agencies\u2014the State Department, Agency for International \nDevelopment, DEA, FBI, ATFE, Homeland Security, and others\u2014\ninvolved in the efforts to improve citizen security and combat organized \ncrime in Central America.  The United States has and should continue to \nmake every effort to respond to\u2014and actively foster\u2014the development \nof both national and regional security plans that provide a comprehensive \nand operational roadmap for addressing questions of long-term \ninstitutional reform and capacity building (in both the security and rule of law arenas) while addressing the underlying social conditions and lack \nof opportunity that serve as incubators for social violence.   \nGetting from here to there is not easy.  The countries of Central \nAmerica have very different levels of institutional capacity as well as \npolitical will to confront organized crime and support the reforms\u2014\ninstitutional as well as social\u2014necessary to make a difference.  Resources \nare essential, but financial support from the international community can only go so far if elites in the region refrain from paying taxes and \npoliticians and societies are unwilling to increase the rate of taxation \nas a percentage of GDP.  Throughout the region, there is a need for an \nincrease in domestic resources to fight crime and its underlying social \ncauses.  This necessitates fiscal reform that increases tax revenue across \nthe board, improves the equity of the tax burden, and improves the \ntransparency and accountability of government spending.\nGuatemala has a particularly poor record in this regard.  Despite years \nof pressure by the international community to raise taxes in the wake of the 1996 peace accord, the tax rate remains one of the lowest in the \nentire hemisphere.  In 2010, the government increased social spending\u2014\nnot in and of itself a bad thing\u2014but did so at the expense of the budgets \nfor law enforcement and the judicial sector.\n21 As Julie L\u00f3pez illustrates in \nher chapter on Guatemala, this political impasse has stymied the efforts of a handful of those in the government\u2014the Attorney General and the \ncrusading human rights activist now at the helm of police reform\u2014to \nimplement changes.\n22  \nThe situation in El Salvador is more promising; the government of \nPresident Mauricio Funes has undertaken a purge of the police force, is \ntargeting social investment to municipalities with high levels of violence \nand exclusion, and is attempting a broad-based national dialogue on \nsocio-economic issues.  The intense, ongoing polarization of Salvadoran Introduction| 13 |society is a key obstacle to the success of these efforts although there \nare hopeful signs of private sector involvement in prevention and \nemployment programs to reduce youth violence. Nicaragua also has a \npromising record of social prevention policies and police reform that \nhave kept youth violence in check and enhanced citizen security at the \ncommunity level; in 2011 the State Department called the Nicaraguan \nNavy \u201cone of Central America\u2019s most effective agencies in narcotics \ninterdictions.\u201d23 \nIn focusing on the countries of the \u201cNorthern Tier,\u201d the U.S. \ngovernment should also remain mindful of countries such as Costa Rica, Belize, and Nicaragua, where drug trafficking is increasing but, \nfor a variety of reasons, has not reached the crisis proportions that exist \nelsewhere in the region.  Short-changing these nations now practically \nguarantees that a greater crisis will develop at some point in the near \nfuture. Areas of priority should include what is being done elsewhere in Central America: assisting security institutions to control \u201cungoverned \nspaces,\u201d reinforcing judicial institutions, establishing or reinforcing \nindependent Inspectors General to investigate and weed out corruption, \nand expanding social protection networks. Working preemptively in \nthese areas is preferable to responding to a situation once it has gotten \nout of hand.\nThe Central American countries themselves have taken steps to \nbetter coordinate their efforts against organized crime and to jointly seek financial and technical support from the international community, \nwith the Central American Integration System (SICA) providing the \ninstitutional framework for these coordination efforts.  In May 2011, for \ninstance, Central American foreign ministers, police chiefs, and other \nsecurity officials met in San Salvador under SICA\u2019s auspices to begin \ndevising a regional security plan.\n24 This initial meeting was followed by \na conference convened by SICA in Antigua, Guatemala on June 22-23 \nwhere all seven of the region\u2019s presidents, as well as the presidents of \nMexico and Colombia, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, several \nEuropean countries, and representatives from the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank met to agree upon the  outline \nof the  \u201cCentral America Security Strategy.\u201dCynthia J. Arnson and Eric L. Olson| 14 |The June SICA conference produced strong political and diplomatic \nsupport for a four-part regional security strategy that includes 22 \nadditional proposed projects intended to help implement the strategy.  \nU.S. and other international donors have responded to the region\u2019s \nstrategy with commitments of continued and renewed funding, as well \nas efforts to improve donor coordination and to strengthen regional \nmechanisms for policy planning and implementation.  For example, the \nUnited States has promised a total of $240 million in finding between fiscal year 2010 and 2011, and the World Bank has promised to make \nsecurity-related loans to the region of approximately $1 billion to help \nfund the strategy.  At the same time, Central American countries must \ntake concrete steps to demonstrate their commitment to the strategy by \nmoving beyond the planning stages and taking steps to make operational \nthe strategy that was adopted in Guatemala in June.   \nThe Obama administration made significant efforts in 2009-\n2011 to emphasize domestic treatment and prevention programs as priority elements of its national drug control strategy.  Redefining the \ndrug abuse problem in the United States as a public health problem \nis beginning to translate into more resources for treatment and \nprevention, with additional increases of one percent and eight percent, \nrespectively, proposed for Fiscal Year 2012.  While drug consumption \nand demand is a growing problem within Latin America\u2014particularly as narco-trafficking organizations pay in product rather than cash\n25\u2014it \nis nevertheless the case that Central America\u2019s problem with organized \ncrime is a direct consequence of the demand for narcotics from the \nUnited States, still the largest market in the world for cocaine and other \ndrugs.  \nFinally, as the United States adopts the framework of \u201cshared \nresponsibility\u201d for the scourge of drug violence throughout \nMesoamerica, it must be mindful of the need to do more:  to combat the traffic in small arms and automatic weapons flowing from North \nto South (the Obama administration has not attempted to reinstate the \nassault weapons ban that expired in 2004); to increase the capacity to \ncombat money laundering, particularly in dollarized economies such as \nEl Salvador\u2019s; and to seize, rather than avoid, opportunities for broader \ndebate on U.S. demand reduction and anti-drug strategies, as called for \nby many in Latin America as well as in the U.S. Congress.  Introduction| 15 |It is no exaggeration to say that crime and violence abetted by \norganized crime constitute central threats to democratic governance in \nCentral America and the survival of democratic institutions.  The task \nis not only to increase law enforcement and judicial capacity, but also \nto address the poverty, exclusion, and lack of opportunity that provide \na vast breeding ground for crime and violence throughout the region.\nEndnotes\n1 This introduction draws extensively from: statement of Cynthia J.

Dudley\nIntroduction\nThe U.S. Government estimates that 90 percent of the illicit \ndrugs entering its borders passes through the Central American \nIsthmus and Mexico. Of this, close to half goes through Central \nAmerica.2 Functioning as a transshipment point has had devastating \nconsequences for Central America, including spikes in violent crime, drug use, and the corroding of government institutions. Mexico receives \nmost of the media attention and the bulk of U.S. aid, but the Northern \nTriangle \u2013 Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras \u2013 has murder rates five \ntimes as high.\nWhile Mexico is having some limited success dealing with its \nspiraling conflict, vulnerable States in Central America are struggling to keep the organized criminal groups at bay, even while they face other \nchallenges such as widespread gang activity. U.S. and Mexican efforts \nto combat the drug cartels in Mexico seem to have exacerbated the \nproblems for Central America, evidenced by ever increasing homicide \nrates.\n 3 \u201cAs Mexico and Colombia continue to apply pressure on drug \ntraffickers, the countries of Central America are increasingly targeted for \ntrafficking, which is creating serious challenges for the region,\u201d the State \nDepartment says in its 2010 narcotics control strategy report.4\nProblems are particularly acute in Guatemala, El Salvador, and \nHonduras, three States with vast coastlines, large ungoverned spaces, \nand the greatest proximity to Mexico. However, geography is only part \nof the problem. Armed conflicts in Guatemala, El Salvador, and parts of \nHonduras between 1960 and the mid-1990s laid the foundations for the \nweapons trafficking, money laundering, and contraband traffic that we \nare witnessing today. Peace accords in Guatemala and El Salvador, and \npolice and military reform, only partially resolved deep-seeded socio-economic and security issues, and, in some cases, may have accelerated a Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 19 |process by which drug traffickers could penetrate relatively new, untested \ngovernment institutions. \nDespite the gravity of the problem, Central America has, until recently, \ngotten little regional or international cooperation to combat it5. Examples \nof cross-border investigations are few. Communication between law \nenforcement is still mostly done on an ad-hoc basis. Promises to create a \ncentralized crime database remain unfulfilled. Local officials are equally \nfrustrated by the lack of international engagement and policies that often \nundermine their ability to control crime, especially as it relates to alleged \ngang members. \nRegional governments also face mixed messages from both the \ninternational community and their local populace, further hampering their efforts to combat rising criminal activity. A push for free trade \nin the region, for example, means more infrastructure, less centralized \ngovernment control, and unfettered borders, all important parts of any \norganized criminal operation. Long histories of the governments\u2019 abuse \nof authority, repression of political movements and outright murder of \npolitical opponents, make locals wary of giving authorities more power to monitor their private lives in an effort to root out crime.\nThis chapter is about drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) \noperating in Central America. It is broken down by theme rather than \nby country. It provides a brief history of DTO activity in the region; \ndescriptions of who operates the DTOs, both locally and internationally, \nand their modus operandi; the use of street gangs in DTO activities; \nDTO penetration in government and security forces; local, regional, and international efforts and challenges as they try and combat DTOs. The \nchapter is centered on the three countries where the problem of DTOs \nappears to be the most acute: Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.\n6\nHistorical Background\nDTOs in Central America can be broken down into two main categories: the managers and the transporters. Local and foreign agents interviewed \nin three different countries by the author indicate the managers are \nmainly Mexican groups who obtain the supplies from Colombian, \nBolivian, and Peruvian groups in the source countries. These Mexican Steven S. Dudley| 20 |groups play an increasingly active role in all parts of a supply chain that \nhas gone through a massive transformation in recent years and warrants \na brief overview. \nIn the 1970s, when coca was a little known leaf outside of Latin \nAmerica, Peru, and Bolivia produced 90 percent of the crop and \ncoca paste. Colombians obtained the paste in bulk, made the cocaine \nhydrochloride (HCl), and exported it to the United States via the \nCaribbean and Central America. By the late 1970s, the Colombians were trafficking large quantities of cocaine through Central America, \nprincipally through Honduras, and then Mexico, giving rise to the first \nCentral American and Mexican DTOs. \nThe Honduran Juan Ram\u00f3n Matta Ballesteros, for instance, split his \ntime between Honduras, Colombia, and Mexico, providing a bridge \nbetween the Medellin Cartel and what would become the Guadalajara \nCartel in Mexico. Other routes through Nicaragua and Panama would eventually compete with Honduras, especially after leaders in the \nGuadalajara and Matta Ballesteros organizations were implicated in the \nmurder of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique \nCamarena in Mexico in 1985 and went on the run. \nIn the 1990s, the supply chain changed after Colombia\u2019s two main \norganizations, the Medellin and Cali Cartels, were dismantled. \nThe end of the Medellin and Cali Cartels meant the end of direct purchase of coca paste in Peru and Bolivia, and the resulting boom in \ncoca production in Colombia. Regions such as Putumayo, along the \nEcuadorean border, Norte de Santander, along the Venezuelan border, \nnorth-central Antioquia near the Panamanian border and the northern \ncoast, and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta on the Caribbean, became \ncenters for coca production. In this scenario, territorial control became \nmore important. While both the Medellin and Cali Cartels operated \nlarge, sophisticated armed networks, the new groups were quite literally \narmies that competed for control of this production.\nOf these, the United Self-Defense Groups of Colombia (Autodefensas \nUnidas de Colombia - AUC) was the largest. A nationwide movement of paramilitary groups formed in the 1990s ostensibly to fight leftist \nguerrillas, at its height, the AUC had some 35,000 soldiers at its \ndisposal.  At the AUC\u2019s center was Diego Murillo, alias \u2018Don Berna,\u2019 \nan ex-guerrilla turned bodyguard and hitman of the Medellin cartel Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 21 |who later converted several local Medellin street gangs into his own \nhit squads and enforcers. Meanwhile, portions of the police split off to \nform the core of Norte del Valle Cartel, a loose syndicate of traffickers \nbased near Cali that also had huge armed groups at their disposal. Pieces \nof the Norte del Valle Cartel eventually merged with the AUC. Some \nguerrilla fronts from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia \n(Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) also became \nincreasingly involved in the production and supply of cocaine, mostly through Venezuela, Brazil, and later Ecuador. \nEach of these organizations used Central America and Mexico to \ntransport their drugs. One AUC leader used the same coastal property \nthat Juan Ram\u00f3n Matta Ballesteros once did to dispatch drugs by land \nand air to different points in the Caribbean, Central America, and \nMexico. The FARC focused mostly on developing their own routes \nthrough Venezuela but also sought contacts in Mexico.\n7 The Norte del \nValle Cartel, fortified the routes that are still the most utilized today, \nspecifically the use of go-fast and fishing boats dispatched along the \nEastern Pacific.8\n1) Sinaloa Cartel: Its operations \nstretch from Chicago to Buenos Aires, but its power base is in Mexico\u2019s so-called northern triangle where much of the marijuana and poppy is grown: Sinaloa, Durango, and Chihuahua. It is also fighting for more control of routes through Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, and Baja California.2) Gulf Cartel: This organization operates in the Eastern states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. However, its former armed wing, known as the Zetas, which was formed by former Mexican Special Forces, has broken ranks and created its own cartel. The two are now disputing its traditional strongholds. 3) Zetas: Formerly the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel, this organization is considered the most disciplined and ruthless of Mexican DTOs. Drawing from their military background, this cartel has systematically obtained new territory throughout Mexico and Central America. 4) Juarez Cartel: Centered in this northern city, this organization is at the heart of the battle for control of \nMajor Mexican dto s:Steven S. Dudley| 22 |In 2003, the supply chain went through another transformation. \nThe Norte del Valle Cartel began a bloody internal war after one faction \nassassinated one of the other faction\u2019s key leaders. The war coincided with \nthe beginning of a peace process in which the AUC leaders demobilized \ntheir armies and handed themselves in to authorities. Several AUC leaders \nwere also assassinated during this process. The Colombian government \nalso began a military offensive against the guerillas, dislodging them \nfrom many of their strongholds in coca-producing areas. \nThe disintegration of the Norte del Valle and AUC Cartels left \nnumerous groups battling for control over their territory and routes, including Mexican organizations such as the Gulf, Tijuana, Juarez, and \nthe Sinaloa Cartels, who have positioned themselves throughout the \nAndes to take advantage of the shakeup. In Colombia, these Mexican \norganizations are now negotiating directly with the HCl providers.\n9 The \neconomics are simple: What is a 20 to 30 percent stake for transporting the cocaine from Mexico to the United States becomes a 70 to 80 percent \nstake by obtaining it at the source.\n10\nIn addition, in Colombia, operating on a large scale has become \nmore difficult. The life-span of today\u2019s capo is often months, not years, \nin part due to skyrocketing number of extraditions from Colombia to \nthe United States.11 The vast number of informants and cooperators \n| 22 |the border and continues to be a \nmajor purchaser of cocaine in source countries such as Colombia.  5) Tijuana Cartel: Fractured in recent years by arrests and infighting, this organization remains a force in this important border town. 6) Beltran-Leyva Organization: After numerous arrests, authorities killed its top leader, Arturo Beltran-Leyva in December 2009. The organization has subsequently split with its former armed wing fighting for control over its territory in the central and western states of Morelos and Guerrero. 7) Familia Michoacana: Originally a paramilitary force designed by the Zetas to fight the Sinaloa Cartel in Michoacan, this disciplined and ruthless organization now operates numerous northern and southern states.Sources: Author interviews with Colombian, Mexican, and U.S. counternarcotics officials. Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 23 |1) Rastrojos: Former Norte de Valle \nlieutenants of Wilber Varela. They have teamed with the Ejercito Revolucionario Popular Antiterrorista Colombiano (ERPAC), which is headed by former AUC commanders who never demobilized, and Daniel Barrera, alias \u2018El Loco.\u2019 They operate from two key points of dispatch: the Pacific Coast and the Venezuelan border. Their Mexican partners are Sinaloa and Juarez Cartels. They use aerial routes leaving from Eastern Colombia and southwestern Venezuela, and seafaring routes from the Pacific Coast. 2) Urabe\u00f1os: Remnants of what was the most powerful army within the AUC. Positioned along the Panamanian border in the northwestern corner of the country with access to both coasts and a sparsely populated border, this is the natural gateway into and out of Colombia. Their Mexican partners are the Gulf Cartel. 3) Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC): 48th Front, which operates along the Ecuadorean border, the 30th Front with access to the Pacific Ocean, its 10th, 45th, 27th, 44th, and 16th Fronts, along the Venezuelan border, and possibly the 57th Front in Choc\u00f3, near the Panamanian border, are the most active suppliers of HCl. Their partner, in most of these cases, is thought to be remnants of the Tijuana Cartel, although recent arrests in Colombia also point to a working relationship with the Juarez Cartel.4) Los Paisas: The third generation Medellin-based, DTO has taken the reigns of Diego Murillo\u2019s routes through that city, stretching north to the Caribbean coast. The Beltran Leyva Organization seems to be their biggest buyer.There are a number of smaller DTOs, including the Oficina de Envigado, Organizaci\u00f3n Nueva Generaci\u00f3n, Los Machos, Renacer, and others, operating in mostly border and coastal areas. Sources: Colombian police intelligence; Cambio; \u201cParamilitaries\u2019 Heirs,\u201d Human Rights\nMajor dto s in Colombia, their areas of  \noperation and possible allies:Steven S. Dudley| 24 |has accelerated the process by which U.S. and Colombian authorities \ncan dismantle a DTO.12 Colombia\u2019s increased capacity to act on this \nintelligence has made for smaller, more agile, and less consolidated \nchains of distribution. Still, it is clear that there are many big Colombian \nDTOs, not all of which have relinquished control of their supply and \nparts of the distribution chain. This was evident in the recent arrests of \n30 Colombians, most of them pilots, who were flying loads of cocaine to \nCentral America for two major Colombian traffickers.13\nToday\u2019s HCl providers in Colombia are former paramilitaries or \nlieutenants of now defunct larger organizations. They are known in Colombia as Emerging Criminal Bands (\u2018Bandas Criminales \nEmergentes\u2019 \u2013 BACRIM). The government has gone to great lengths to \ndistance them from the AUC.\n14 But it\u2019s clear that they operate in many \nof the same zones as their predecessors and use many of the same routes with slightly updated methods. They are noticeably smaller in terms \nof numbers, but they maintain enough forces for territorial control of \nproduction, storage and dispatch. \nTheir relations with each other are as fluid as their relations with the \nMexican DTOs and even their former rivals, the leftist rebels. Some \nformer paramilitaries, for example, buy HCl directly from the FARC or, increasingly, the smaller guerilla faction known as the National \nLiberation Army (Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional \u2013 ELN). In one case, \nalong the northeastern border with Venezuela, numerous guerrilla and \nformer paramilitary groups seem to be operating in concert to make use \nof one of the most lucrative growth and dispatch points in the region. \nThe Catatumbo region houses at least two rebel groups and perhaps \nthree BACRIMs who are buying coca paste and processing it there or dispatching it to laboratories in Colombia to ready for export.\n15\nFor its part, the FARC is an important HCl source, especially \nalong the Ecuadorean and Venezuelan borders, although there are also \nreports of a guerrilla group dispatching drugs from the Urab\u00e1 region \nnear Panama as well. Colombian authorities say they work closest with \nthe Tijuana Cartel, an assertion that could be questioned given the \ngreatly diminished stature of the cartel in their hometown.16 The ELN, \nmeanwhile, has broadened its portfolio from simply protection and \nmuscle of BACRIM to developing their own patches of coca production \nand possibly their own processing and distribution chain.Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 25 |Central America\u2019s Transportistas\nNot since Juan Ram\u00f3n Matta Ballesteros have Central American \norganizations played central roles in drug trafficking. They serve \none central purpose: to transport drugs between South America and Mexico. For that reason, they are known in the region as transportistas . \nIncreasingly, however, these organizations have also taken on the role \nof local distributors and, in some cases, the suppliers of marijuana and \npoppy, for the production of heroin, as well as importers and suppliers for \nthe raw ingredients of synthetic drugs that are manufactured in Mexico, \nNicaragua, and possibly Honduras.\nRecent indicators tell part of the story. Guatemala eradicated a \nrecord 1,300 hectares of poppy in 2009, while Colombia eradicated 546 \nhectares.\n17 While estimates of its poppy production are still far lower \nthan Mexico\u2019s, Guatemala has presumably supplanted Colombia as the \nsecond highest producer in the region. Guatemala also seized twelve \nmetric tons of pseudoephedrine.18 Honduran authorities seized three \nmillion pseudoephedrine pills. Drug consumption, in particular powder \nand crack cocaine, is also up substantially and has governments in places \nlike Costa Rica and Panama concerned. Consumption often correlates \nto DTO activity since the managers often pay the local transportistas  in \nproduct who distribute it themselves or parcel it out to the street gangs to distribute. \nNonetheless, the transportista  organizations\u2019 main function on a \nregional level remains that of receiving, storing, and transporting the drugs safely, mostly to Mexico but sometimes directly to the United \nStates.\n19 The transporters tend to come from similar backgrounds and \noperate in similar spaces. They are, by and large, thieves or experts in \ncontraband. Before working with DTOs, they had prior knowledge of \nthe routes and contacts in the right government circles to move or sell \ntheir illicit products. Increasingly in Honduras, some are reportedly \nemerging from the landed classes\u2014sons of large cattle owners and other \nagribusiness. \nThey have, over time, expanded their businesses to include illegal \ndrugs, as well as other operations that also facilitate the movement of drugs such as human smuggling. They operate in border regions and \ncoastal areas. Some even have dual citizenship, which facilitates their Steven S. Dudley| 26 |movements and, at times, their ability to avoid law enforcement. They \nare beholden to larger organizations, at one time Colombian now mostly \nMexican, but their relations with these organizations are fluid. They tend \nto work with whomever pays and, up until recently, did not appear to be \nswallowed by the often bloody conflicts that envelop their employers in \nColombia and Mexico. \nIn Guatemala, three traditional families have reportedly long \ndominated the transport business: the Mendozas, Lorenzanas, and Leones. The Mendozas concentrate on the Pet\u00e9n province, the \nLorenzanas in the central highlands and along the eastern border near \nHonduras, and the Leones in Zacapa province, along the Honduran \nborder.\n20 On the western edge of the country, a trafficker identified as \nJuan Alberto Ortiz Lopez is believed to control the critically important San Marcos province, along the Mexican border and the Pacific coast. A \nsmattering of smaller groups operate along the Pacific Coast and central \nhighlands, including several that are operated by Otoniel Turcios and \nHearst Walter Overdick, both of whom appear on the DEA\u2019s shortlist of \nthe country\u2019s top traffickers.\n21\nIn Honduras, the transportistas  are, by and large, locals who have some \nexperience trafficking contraband, stealing automobiles, or rustling cattle.\n22 Although several intelligence sources mentioned that large \nlandowners are increasingly entering the business, these landowners appear to be more important as infrastructure than personnel. \nNonetheless, as in Guatemala, it is usually a family trade. Two of the \nmore infamous transporters are Nelson and Javier Rivera, former car \nthieves and cattle rustlers. They run the so-called Cachiros gang, which \nstretches from Col\u00f3n along the northern coast to the Gracias a Dios \nprovince in the East and the Olancho province to the south. Other, lesser known groups appear to operate in Yoro, Olancho and Cort\u00e9s.\n23\nThere\u2019s a substantial crossover of transport groups in the region, \nespecially in the south of Honduras where the country reaches the Fonseca \nGulf.24 There, longtime transporters such as Reynerio Flores Lazo and \nJose Natividad Luna, alias \u2018Chapo,\u2019 trafficked in dairy contraband before entering the drug trade. Flores eventually ran his own fleet of trucks that \nmoved contraband and later drugs from Panama to El Salvador. Luna \nfigured out creative ways to conceal the origin of his cheese along the Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 27 |border area before branching into concealing drugs through the region. \nBoth are dual citizens. Flores was arrested last year in Honduras.25\nOther smaller operations \nexist in Nicaragua, Costa \nRica, and Panama. These \ngroups operate in abandoned \nregions along the coastlines \nand border areas. Like their \ncounterparts in the Northern \nTriangle, they reportedly take orders from more \npowerful organizations. \nOf these three countries, \nevidence of the most DTO \nactivity is in Panama. \nPanamanian authorities \nseized a record 54 tons of cocaine in 2009, the largest \namount for any country in \nthe region.\n26 It has also seen \nits murder rate double from \n10 per 100,000 inhabitants to \nnearly 20 per 100,000, since \n2006.\nThis troubling trend can, in part, be explained by geography. Panama \nsits at the \u201cmouth of the funnel,\u201d where much of the processed cocaine \nmakes its first pass north of South America via air, land, and sea. This proximity has made Panama a natural way station, meeting place, and \nbusiness hub for traffickers throughout the region who are seeking to \nexchange large loads of product for cash, weapons or other goods; or \nbroker deals amongst one another and even politicians. To be sure, \nthe country\u2019s status as a \u201cneutral\u201d meeting ground dates at least back \nto the 1980s when Colombian politicians sought to broker deals with \nthe Medellin Cartel to end that criminal organization\u2019s war with the Colombian State. (It helps that Panama\u2019s national currency is the U.S. \ndollar.) More recently, however, there are indications that this neutrality \nhas been broken.

He eventually branched into contraband in Honduras, then slowly spread his network\u2019s tentacles to Panama where he gathered and sold everything from rice to counterfeit jeans. He also used his transportation network to send illegal immigrants through the well-traveled migrant routes of Central America. The leap into drugs was not far. Authorities believe he and what has since become known as Los Perrones, which included his friend Juan Natividad Luna, made contact with Colombians in the mid-1990s and began facilitating shipments for their Mexican partners.\nSource: Author interview, prosecutor in the Public Ministry, \nSan Salvador, El Salvador, February 16, 2010. Steven S. Dudley| 28 |of merchandise from the Colombians in order to then sell it at a lower \nprice to their Mexican counterparts. The various groups appear to be \nincreasingly stealing large amounts of merchandise from each other in \norder to then sell it at a \u201cdiscount\u201d price to counterparts. Authorities are \nsaying these thefts are at the heart of a spate of killings in Panama City \nand elsewhere.27\nBut the spread of this type of violence may only partially explain the \nnational uptick in homicides. Another explanation includes an increase \nin gang membership, local drug distribution points, and subsequent \n\u201cbattle for the corners.\u201d28 The FARC guerrillas have also increased their \npresence and possibly their distribution of cocaine through Panama and \ntheir battles with the Panamanian security forces have become more \ncommon.29 In either case, the surge in violence and increase in seizures \nare cause for concern going forward. \nCosta Rica and Nicaragua appear to be more way stations than transit \npoints. These groups\u2019 activities include providing intelligence, temporary \nstorage and transportation assistance, including trucks or human \nmules to move the drugs via commercial aircraft out of the countries\u2019 \ninternational airports. Panama and Costa Rica also offer attractive local \ndrug markets as well as numerous possibilities to launder money.30 \nDTOs in Central America\nLarge DTOs have long operated in Central America. As outlined earlier, the Honduran Juan Ram\u00f3n Matta Ballesteros worked closely with both \nColombian and Mexican traffickers in the region since at least the early \n1980s. Nicaragua was a critical transit point for the Medellin Cartel \nduring that same period. General Manuel Noriega also let Medellin \nCartel traffickers use Panama as a safe-haven, bank and launching pad for \ndrug shipments through the 1980s. In the 1990s, there is some evidence \nthat Mexican traffickers began a more concerted effort to control the flow of drugs through the region. Sinaloa Cartel head Joaquin Guzm\u00e1n, \nalias \u2018El Chapo,\u2019 was captured in Guatemala in 1993.\n31 Still, evidence of \nlarge-scale operations by Mexican DTOs has been scant until recently.\nThere are several clues that bolster local and international agents\u2019 \nassessment that Mexican groups have shifted some of their operations to Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 29 |Central America. To begin with, cocaine seizures in Central America \nhave climbed steadily. The increases suggest that larger organizations \nhave begun to use the region to receive, store and move larger quantities \nof drugs. This requires more administration and logistics, which lead to \nmore of a physical presence in the countries where most of the trafficking \nis occurring. \n*Source: United Nations World Drug Report 2009 \u201cSeizures\u201d\nThe biggest seizures occur near the \u201cmouth\u201d of what remains \nthe world\u2019s biggest cocaine depot: Colombia. In 2007, Panamanian \nauthorities captured 21 metric tons of cocaine off the coast, the largest \nseizure ever recorded.32 But other sizeable seizures have occurred farther \nnorth. In February 2010, Costa Rican authorities captured three metric \ntons of cocaine in a cargo truck, one of the biggest seizures ever for that \ncountry.33 In 2009, Guatemalan and U.S. authorities captured a semi-\nsubmersible submarine off the coast carrying 4.9 metric tons.34\nHomicide rates in the region are climbing and changing in nature, \nanother key indicator of stronger DTO presence. To cite just one \nexample, through late February 2010, El Diario de Hoy newspaper in El \nSalvador had counted 35 bodies found in plastic bags since September in \nthat country.35 In addition, in a presentation at the end of 2009, forensic \ndoctors said they had found an increasing number of bodies with signs \nof torture, others that died with coup de grace, and still others in mass graves.

Dudley| 30 |style hits, which are normally well-planned, coordinated attacks on \nspecific targets using high-caliber weapons to subdue or disable their \nvictims, and often include evidence of torture and excessive force to \nsend messages to rivals.36 \nThe locations of the high incidence of homicides also coincide with \nareas of heavy drug trafficking activity. These include the northern coast of Honduras, the eastern border of El Salvador, and the northern \njungles of Guatemala. A United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \nreport from this year that included a section on the Northern Triangle \nand Mexico said that the threat of organized crime was \u201cincreasing\u201d in \nthe Mesoamerica region.\n37 \u201cContrary to what would be expected, in \nnone of these countries is the highest murder rate found in the largest \ncities: rather it is found in provinces that have strategic value to drug \ntraffickers,\u201d the report said.38\nLocal and foreign narcotics \nagents in the Northern Triangle \nsaid that the two countries \nfacing the greatest threats due to \nthe presence of Mexican DTOs \nare Honduras and Guatemala. \nThese two countries also see \nthe most trafficking: In 2009, an estimated 200 metric tons \npassed through Honduras, and \nan estimated 250 tons went \nthrough Guatemala.\n39 The two \nmain Mexican DTOs operating in these countries are the Sinaloa \nCartel and the Zetas.\nIn Honduras, these agents say \nthat Sinaloa factions work closely \nwith transportistas  in Olancho \nand near the Gulf of Fonseca. \nSinaloa Cartel members are also \nreportedly buying land, building houses and co-opting local officials in the Copan, Santa Barbara and Cort\u00e9s provinces along the Guatemalan \nborder, areas they are also using for storage and trafficking activities.\n40 a sinaloa Mayor in h onduras\nHonduran police intelligence say El Paraiso, \nCopan Mayor Alexander Ardon works with the Sinaloa Cartel. Ardon has built a town hall that resembles the White House, complete with a heliport on the roof, and travels with 40 heavily armed bodyguards. Cameras monitor the roads leading in and out of the town, intelligence services say. And there are reports that the mayor often closes the city to outsiders for big parties that include norte\u00f1a music groups flown in from Mexico.\nSource: Author interviews, Honduran police intelligence and officials, Tegucigalpa, Honduras, \nFebruary 21-25, 2010.Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 31 |According to local intelligence sources in Honduras, the Zetas mostly \noperate in Olancho and Cort\u00e9s. Local press reported the capture of five \nZeta members in January 2010, just north of San Pedro Sula.41 The Zetas \nare also hiring members of the Barrio 18  gang as hitmen in Honduras, \nintelligence officials said. Evidence, they say, emerged in February 2010, \nwhen authorities intercepted a package on a bus. In the package was a \nnote authorizing the assassination of Security Minister Oscar Alvarez. \n\u201cLet\u2019s try and do this job as soon as possible,\u201d the encoded note from \nthe 18 allegedly said, \u201cSince our \u2018friends\u2019 the Zetas gave us a $20,000 \nadvance and said they would give us another $150,000 if we do this job \nwell.\u201d42\nMore troubling still was the assassination of the country\u2019s drug \nczar, Col. Julian Aristides Gonz\u00e1lez, in December 2009, shortly after \nhe had dropped his daughter at school. Aristides had made his battle \npublic, including just days before his death, when he detailed in a press \nconference recent discoveries of clandestine airstrips in the province of \nOlancho, among other news. Reports following his death blamed the \nSinaloa Cartel, which may have hired local assassins to perform the hit.43  \nThese local assassins were allegedly part of a network created by Hector \nAmador Portillo, alias \u2018El Gato Negro,\u2019 who controlled a large part of \nTegucigalpa\u2019s retail drug distribution market.44 Portillo was assassinated, \nalong with several of his bodyguards, in April 2010.45 \nIn Guatemala, the situation may be worse. There, these same two \nMexican factions have been slowly taking control of the country\u2019s drug \ntrade. The Sinaloa Cartel has reportedly focused on the Guatemalan-\nMexican border and along the Pacific coast. Anti-narcotics agents \nbelieve that most of the cocaine transiting Guatemala comes via the \nPacific Ocean through Sinaloa operators\u2019 hands. It is one of the oldest \nand still the surest route, they say.46 The Sinaloa Cartel also appears to \nbe working with powerful local transportistas  in the mountainous parts of \nthe San Marcos province where most of the country\u2019s poppy is grown. And the cartel reportedly has a strong working relationship with a host \nof smaller families in the Huehuetenango region along the Mexican \nborder to control passage through that vital region.\n47\nWhile Sinaloa factions have operated in Guatemala for years, it\u2019s the \nZetas that garner the most attention and press coverage. This may be \ndue, in part, to their brash tactics. In March 2008, the group attacked Steven S. Dudley| 32 |one of the principal Guatemalan drug gangs leaving eleven people dead, \nincluding Juan Leon, alias \u2018Juancho,\u2019 the head of the one of Guatemala\u2019s \nprimary trafficking clans, the Leones. Since then the Zetas have \nreportedly moved to take control of several important junctures: the \nZacapa province, a critical entry point for drugs coming from Honduras \nin the east; Pet\u00e9n province, Guatemala\u2019s largest state, where they control \nhundreds of unsanctioned border crossings into Mexico; and the Alta \nVerapaz province in the central highlands, which gives them access to Guatemala City to the south, Pet\u00e9n to the north and Zacapa to the east.\n48 \nAlta Verapaz is also the crossing point for the Transversal Norte , a trucking \nroute across the north that leads to Mexico through Huehuetenango in the west.\n49\nHowever, it\u2019s Huehuetenango where the battle for Guatemala between \nthe Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas may be decided. The two Mexican \ncartels have clashed in that province, a critical juncture that provides \neasy access to the Gulf, the Pacific Ocean and land routes through the \ncenter of Mexico. The battle for Huehuetenango began in November \n2008, when Zetas ambushed a pro-Sinaloa Guatemalan group who was \nhosting a horse festival. The attack left as many as 60 dead, according to \nlocals who spoke to the firemen who recovered the bodies, most of them factions tied to the Zetas. Much of the fighting is in La Democracia, a \nsmall city along the country\u2019s northwestern highway, where regular gun \nbattles occur. Local sources indicated that the Sinaloa factions maintain \nthe upper hand.\n50\nThe  Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s ability to keep the Zetas out of Huehuetenango \nmay be explained by examining their different modus operandi. Sinaloa seems more willing to negotiate with local traffickers. In \nHuehuetenango, this means Sinaloa has integrated itself into the local \ncommunity as well as included it in some of the benefits: They give jobs, \nprovide health care, and fund local festivals, several people who live in \nthe region said. Sinaloa members have also replaced the state in terms \nof security by killing or disposing of smaller criminal enterprises. The Zetas, meanwhile, have a more vertical structure and impose their will \nby force.\n51 They rarely negotiate with the locals, and they tend to bring \nin their own people rather than recruit people who live in the area. This is in line with their military backgrounds, analysts and counternarcotics \nagents said.\n52Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 33 |In some respects, the Zetas may have advantages over the Sinaloa \nCartel. The Zetas reportedly have a sophisticated and generous work \npackage for those who join, which includes such perks as dry cleaning \nclothes for their members. A number of ex-military have also joined \ntheir ranks, local and international intelligence officials said. For \ninstance, numerous Guatemalan special forces, known as Kaibiles , many \nof them out of work following peace talks with the leftist guerrillas and the reduction of the size of the military forces, have allegedly become operatives for the Zetas.\n53 This accelerates their training and gives them \na tactical advantage during battles, officials said.54\nHowever, Guatemalan intelligence officials also said the focus on the \nex-Kaibiles  is misdirected. The real issue, they and analysts say, is the little \noversight of the proliferating private security industry in Guatemala. There are as many as 150,000 private security guards in the country.\n55 \nMost of them began after the peace talks. Much of the industry is run \nby ex-army intelligence and high-ranking officers, including many with \nlong-time ties to organized crime, as is explained later in this chapter. \nThese private armies carry legally registered guns, including automatic \nweapons they can obtain in Guatemala. They also use their experience \ngathering intelligence to intercept phone calls, emails, and gather other \nintelligence for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes.56 \nThe battles in Guatemala are not limited to fights between the \nMexican Cartels. In Cob\u00e1n, the Zetas are fighting with local groups who are reluctant to give up their territory. The city has regular mafia-\nstyle hits and gun fights in public places. One recent shootout at the \ncity\u2019s main mall left several members of a local faction dead. Firemen \nsaid they pick up between three and six bodies per month with signs of \ntorture and victims with their hands and feet tied, symbols of a tit-for-tat between the groups.\n57 Drive-by shootings are also common, police \nsaid.58 The Zetas appear to be using a divide-and-conquer strategy. At \nleast one local faction has reportedly split; one of its major leaders now \nworks for the Zetas.59Steven S. Dudley| 34 |Penetration  of the Government  forces  and institutions\nTo varying degrees, international DTOs and local transportistas  have \npenetrated portions of the police, treasury, customs, military, attorney \ngeneral\u2019s offices, jails, and court systems in Central America. They \nregularly finance public works and bankroll political campaigns. Their \nability to outspend the governments frustrates the local authorities and \nthwarts efforts to slow the DTOs\u2019 growth. This is particularly true \nin Guatemala and Honduras, two governments that have seemingly \nlost control over large swaths of \ntheir territory. \u201cIt\u2019s not Somalia. \nYou can look outside and still see \nthat things work here,\u201d one foreign \ndiplomat in Guatemala City said \nbefore naming seven provinces \u2013 San Marcos, Huehuetenango, \nPet\u00e9n, Alta Verapaz, Izabal, Jutiapa \nand Zacapa \u2013 that he believed are \nnot under government control.\n60\nIn Guatemala, both the DTOs \nand the transportistas  work with \n\u201chidden forces\u201d or so-called Cuerpos \nIlegales y Aparatos Clandestinos de Seguridad (CIACS), which loosely \ntranslates as Illegal Clandestine Security Apparatuses.\n61 The CIACS \ninclude active and ex-military officers, special forces operatives, \nand high-level government \nofficials. Many of them met while \noperating in intelligence branches \nof the government.\n62 They have \ntheir own operations or offer their services to other criminal \norganizations, which includes the Cofrad\u00eda\nThe most famous of the CIACS \nwas known as the Cofrad\u00eda or \u201cThe \nBrotherhood,\u201d a reference to name Mayan elders take in rural Guatemala. The Cofrad\u00eda  began as kind of an \ninformal club where current and former intelligence officers fraternized. Eventually, however, it became an organized criminal enterprise where many of these same military officials could undermine the authority of civilian governments using the intelligence services and take advantage of their vast knowledge of the gaps in public security to make money legitimately and illegitimately. The Cofrad\u00eda  has since \nsplit into multiple factions. Some of its former associates are in private security. Others operate in the public sphere, working closely with political parties that serve their interests. Several have been arrested, accused of crimes ranging from murder to embezzlement. \nSources: Author interviews of former and \ncurrent security officials, Guatemala City, Guatemala, January 19 \u2013 February 4, 2010.Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 35 |access to intelligence, weapons, and planning expertise. Their criminal \nactivities range from drug trafficking to contraband and the sale of \nGuatemalan passports. Over the years, they have obtained high positions \nin the central government, which has led to embezzlement schemes, \nthe sale of government-issued weapons on the black market, and the \nengineering of lucrative government public works contracts for a fee.63\nThe DTOs in Guatemala also appear to have penetrated the interior \nministry, customs, and the attorney general\u2019s office. For years, the \ntransportistas  have influenced courts by sponsoring lawyers in their studies \nand their law practices. This helps them engineer the selection of judges in the high and appellate courts as well as influence the selection of the \nattorney general. Last year, the United Nations\u2019 backed International \nCommission Against Impunity (CICIG), an international investigative \nunit working with Guatemala\u2019s government on high profile cases, blocked the selection of five questionable judges.\n64 Inside the police, these \nofficial connections help the DTOs obtain safe passage for their drugs. \nPolice often clear roadblocks, provide weaponry, and, at times, give \narmed escorts for the drugs to enter, be stored and move with relative \nease. When DTO members are arrested, these government officials can \nalso often ensure favorable jail conditions or a quick release because the \nprosecutors sabotage the case.65\nThe startling reality of the DTOs reach has become public in the \nlast several months. In February 2010, Guatemalan authorities arrested Guatemala\u2019s police chief Baltazar G\u00f3mez and the top anti-narcotics \nintelligence officer, Nelly Bonilla. The two were connected to the \ndeaths of five police officers that were ambushed by the Zetas in April \n2009, as those police were trying to steal 900 kilos of cocaine from a \nZetas\u2019 stash house. The weapons used to kill the policemen were stolen \nfrom an army cache. Gomez was the second chief arrested in less than a year. Last August, authorities captured Porfirio P\u00e9rez for stealing a \ncocaine cargo in Guatemala City.   \nOutside the capital, Mexican DTOs have allegedly penetrated local \ngovernments, police, and traditional political structures, local and \nnational government intelligence officials say. In Huehuetenango, for \ninstance, the Sinaloa Cartel is reportedly bankrolling several political \nparties and has a stake in important economic sectors like the construction industry. The cartel has also apparently used its influence in the interior Steven S. Dudley| 36 |ministry to steer investigations and law enforcement toward its rival, the \nZetas, a common tactic that the Sinaloa Cartel has employed effectively \nin Mexico as well. For example, one Huehuetenango official said the \npolice had found several drug and weapons stash houses in the area, all of \nthem pertaining to the Zetas.66\nGuatemalan authorities seem to have little interest or ability to fight \nagainst this wave of firepower and relative sophistication of these new arrivals. In Cob\u00e1n, for instance, heavily armed men dressed in civilian \nclothes ride around in truck beds, often crossing paths with the police. \nWith only 30 officers on any given day, the police in Cob\u00e1n say they are \nundermanned.\n67 However, residents say police collusion is well known. \nIn January 2010, Zetas overran a private recreational swimming area \nnear Cob\u00e1n. Fearful of the traffickers\u2019 antics and weaponry, the owners \ncalled the police. Up to five police vehicles and personnel surrounded the \narea, but when they were about to move on the Zetas, their commander \nreceived a phone call from his regional boss calling him off and sending \nhim and his patrolmen back to base.68\nIn recent months, the government\u2019s fight has centered on Alta \nVerapaz, a place that some investigators say has become the headquarters of one of the top two Zeta leaders.\n69 The United States government \nhas also noticed. In a 2009 diplomatic cable, released by the whistle-blower site WikiLeaks, a United States political officer details the extent \nof the Zeta stranglehold on the region.\n70 The cable said the Zetas may \nhave had as many as 100 operatives in Cob\u00e1n, the province\u2019s capital \ncity, that had set up residence in two neighborhoods with the help of \nGuatemalan authorities who had, among other activities, facilitated \nGuatemalan documentation to help the traffickers legalize their status in \nthe country. The cable goes on to say that the Mexican traffickers may \nhave set up a \u201ctraining camp\u201d in the area, intimidated and kidnapped \nlocal landowners, and regularly tried to recruit police into their cadre.  \nIn December, the Guatemalan government declared a 30-day \u201cstate \nof siege\u201d in Alta Verapaz, which was subsequently extended by another 30 days in January. This emergency measure allowed the 400 army \ntroops and the fresh set of police sent to the province by the government \nto detain suspects with little cause and perform widespread search and \nseizures. The results, however, were mixed. Alta Verapaz residents told \nthe author that the leaders of the drug trafficking gangs knew that the Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 37 |authorities were coming and simply vacated the area.71 Authorities made \n22 arrests, none of them known leaders.72 Still, Alta Verapaz residents, \naccording to local polls, approved of the measure and violence dropped \nduring \u201cstate of siege.\u201d73 \nIn Honduras, in addition to the Copan, Santa Barbara, and Cort\u00e9s \nprovinces alluded to earlier, authorities say the Cachiros\u2019  control the \nlocal police in Col\u00f3n, Gracias a Dios, and parts of Olancho. Penetration into the police was evident July 2009, when 10 members of the elite \nanti-narcotics Operation Group were arrested transporting 142 kilos of \ncocaine. The Cachiros  have also attempted to control policy at a national \nlevel. When their liaison failed to secure their pick for vice-minister \nof security, they killed him. The would-be vice-minister is now a \nrepresentative for congress.\n74\nPolitics and drug trafficking may have crossed paths recently in the \nprovince of Olancho as well. In November 2009, two truckloads of armed men attacked longtime Liberal Party leader, Ulises Sarmiento, \nwhile he was visiting with his son. The attackers, some 12 to 15 of them, \naccording to witnesses, fired on the house with semi-automatic weapons \nand grenade launchers, leaving two of Sarmiento\u2019s bodyguards dead \nand 400 bullet holes in the walls. Sarmiento\u2019s son said the attack bore \nsigns of an organized criminal operation and blamed the local police for assisting.\n75\nThe Perrones  case in El Salvador also revealed the level of penetration \nthe transportistas  have in that government.76 Authorities connected some \nof these individuals with police officials, prosecutors, and politicians in \nEl Salvador. The list included the director of the police and a high-\nranking officer, a high-ranking prosecutor, and a senator. The prosecutor \nwas never investigated, but the politician committed suicide under \nmysterious circumstances. Neither police official has been charged. But \nthree policemen were indicted in 2010, for assisting one of the Perrones\u2019 \noperations along the coast. There are over 40 police being investigated in cases connected to the Perrones .\n77 Steven S. Dudley| 38 |Modus Operandi\nDTOs are businesses. Their objective is to limit costs and maximize \nprofits. They do this by trying to minimize the number of participants, \nborders crossed, authorities they have to bribe. This helps explain why they insist on established forms of transport through Central America. \nWhile officials and counterdrug agents say the use of land routes has increased significantly in recent years, the most reliable, quickest, and \npresumably cheapest routes remain via sea in go-fasts, fishing trawlers \nor increasingly semi-submersibles; or by air in single or twin-engine \naircraft. U.S. officials in Guatemala say that 70 percent of the drugs \npassing through the country arrive via its Pacific Coast.\n78 Honduran \nintelligence officials say the majority of the drugs going through \nHonduras arrive via boat as well.79\nThe seafaring traffic leaves Ecuador\u2019s Pacific Coast and Colombia\u2019s \nPacific and Caribbean coasts in mostly go-fasts and semi-submersibles. A go-fast can make it to Honduras\u2019 Gracias a Dios province in six \nhours, officials said. To maximize efficiency, traffickers hollow out \nthe boats, loading them with drugs and the gasoline/oil mix they use \nas fuel. Along the way, they reportedly use the Corn, Blue, and San \nAndres Islands off Nicaragua, or the Roat\u00e1n Islands off the coast of \nHonduras, to rendezvous with other boats, aircraft, or to leave the load at a temporary storage point. They offload along both Nicaraguan and \nHonduran coasts, although U.S. authorities believe that most of the \ntraffic moves straight through Honduras. There, smaller vehicles take \nthe cargo to depots or waiting trucks where they continue their journey \nnorth through Guatemala and Mexico.\n80 \nThe northern-most Nicaraguan-Honduran border has the added \nadvantage of being an important shrimp, clam, and lobster fishing area, making enforcement difficult under any circumstances. Mosquito \nIndians live on both sides of the border. The impoverished Indians \nhave little economic opportunities aside from working in the fishing \nindustry, which regularly exploits them. They have also long distrusted \nthe governments that have virtually ignored them. The region is nearly bereft of state services and roads, save for the few dirt tracks that the \nCentral Intelligence Agency and Contras made to help them establish \ntraining camps in the 1980s to battle the Sandinista regime. The locals\u2019 Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 39 |disdain for authorities was evident after a boat full of drugs was beached \nin the Gracias a Dios province last year. Authorities arrived to find \nhundreds of men, women and children emptying the boat of its cocaine. \nThe load, an estimated 500-800 kilos, disappeared into the homes and \nbusinesses of the Mosquito Indians in a matter of minutes. Efforts to \nrecover it were only partially successful. House by house searches turned \nup just over 200 kilos.81 \nEl Salvador also gets shipments via sea, in particular via the Fonseca \nGulf and the Sonsonate province. One of the famous Perrones , Daniel \nQuezada, allegedly used his beachfront hotel to receive drug shipments that he and his men, with the help of police, then moved through San \nMiguel by road and eventually into Guatemala. The coastal province of \nSonsonate offers a more direct route into Guatemala. Sonsonate is also \nhome to several powerful gangs, which can provide protection for these loads.\n82 (There is more on the gang question below.)  \nAn uptick by authorities in interdictions of fishing trawlers and cargo \nships \u2013 \u201cstateless vessels\u201d \u2013 has pushed DTOs to rely more on go-fasts and the so-called semi-submersibles. The use of what are essentially \nmini-submarines is a relatively new phenomenon dating to the late \n1990s when a clandestine factory for the first subs was discovered in rural \nColombia. Today\u2019s semi-submersibles are 45 to 82 feet in length and are \nmade of fiberglass or steel. They have a range of 2,000 miles and can carry up to seven metric tons of cocaine. U.S. officials estimate that over \n60 submarines move over 300 metric tons of cocaine per year. Most of \nthe subs leave Colombia\u2019s and Ecuador\u2019s Pacific Coastlines.\n83\nAir traffic into Honduras has long been a problem, but it rose \nsignificantly following the military ousting of President Manuel Zelaya \nlast June. The increase was attributed to a shift in resources to the capital \ncity to keep control of the protests following the coup and the decrease \nin U.S. radar and naval support. Police and government intelligence \nofficials said the flights they were able to track in the last six months \nof 2009, took off from the Apure and Zulia provinces in southwestern \nVenezuela. They headed straight north towards the Dominican Republic in an apparent attempt to avoid Colombian-based radars, then turned \nsharply to the west and landed in the Gracias a Dios, Col\u00f3n, Olancho, \nAtl\u00e1ntida and Yoro provinces.\n84Steven S. Dudley| 40 |Infrastructure abounds in Honduras to facilitate these landings, in \nparticular in the Yoro and Olancho provinces. There are hundreds of \nclandestine landing strips and numerous old air fields in Yoro courtesy \nof the banana exporting companies that once dominated the economy. \nYoro\u2019s relatively flat terrain also permits airplanes to land on highways \nand sparsely trafficked roads. Olancho, meanwhile, seems to be a relative \nnewcomer to the drug business. While the infamous Juan Ram\u00f3n \nMatta Ballesteros bought large quantities of land in the department, it appears as if enough local agri-business kept drug running activities to \na minimum until relatively recently when a so-called \u201cnew generation\u201d \nbegan \u201clending\u201d their large haciendas  for drug airplanes. Farm owners \nare reported to receive $50,000 per flight.\n85\nThe infrastructure needed to operate these landing strips is minimal. \nIn just a few hours, teams of 25 to 30 men can cut the grass and trees, \nopen up the fences and set up the lights to receive the airplanes. The \nairplanes are hollowed out and the drugs are packed in what are called \nfardos, which can weigh as much as a heavy suitcase (about 50 pounds) but \nare still easily manageable. The amount of drugs the planes carry vary, but one Honduran official said that traffickers found the shorter distance \nto Honduras gave the DTOs an opportunity to pack more drugs into each airplane. Once a plane lands, it takes between 20 and 30 minutes \nto offload the cargo into the waiting vehicles. As extra insurance, police \nare sometimes hired to provide protection and escorts for these drug \nshipments, for which the commander can receive between $2,500 to \n$5,000.\n86\nMoving the drugs by land immediately becomes more complicated \nfor the DTOs. The rule appears to be to hide in plain sight. Most of the \ndrugs that move by land go on large trucks in hidden compartments or \ncamouflaged within legitimate cargo. They move via main highways, in \nparticular the Pan American highway. They also cross the borders at the \nmajor checkpoints, which have to deal with the largest amount of traffic. \nThey understand that Central American and Mexican authorities have \nnot prioritized their border controls. The Mexican-Guatemalan border, for example, is 600 miles long and has but eight checkpoints. A Mexican \nofficial in Guatemala said that his government does not really begin to \nmount significant checks of cargo and people passing into Mexico until \nCoatzacoalcos, more than 200 miles from the Guatemalan border. The Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 41 |Mexican government has also facilitated labor mobility, allowing and \nencouraging Guatemalans to seek work in Mexican tourist areas. \u201cWe \ndon\u2019t want to militarize our border,\u201d he said.87\nGang Involvement in DTOs\nGangs, or maras as they are known, have a long history in the region \nbut began operating en masse in Central America in the early 1990s. \nThe reasons for their growth are many: poverty; marginalization; lack \nof access to basic services and educational opportunities; dysfunctional \nfamilies; rapid and unplanned urbanization in the region; repatriation \nof experienced gang members from the United States; and the culture \nof violence that preceded their emergence, including one in which guns \nwere prevalent and ex-combatants from the long-standing civil wars were active in criminal networks. \nU.S. Deportations and Percentage of Criminal Deportees: \nNorthern Triangle\nCountry FY2007% \nCriminal \nDeporteesFY2008% \nCriminal \nDeporteesFY2009% \nCriminal \nDeportees\nHonduras 30,227 17.6% 29,758 18.8% 27,566 25.1%\nGuatemala 26,429 15.3% 28,866 18.5% 30,229 21.5%\nEl Salvador 21,029 24.2% 20,949 27.4% 21,049 30.0%\nSource: \u201cGangs in Central America,\u201d Congressional Research Service, December 4, 2009.\nThere are dozens of gangs, but the Mara Salvatrucha , or MS-13 , and \nthe Barrio 18 , or 18 , are the largest. Both began in Los Angeles. The 18 \nhas Mexican roots; the MS-13  has Salvadoran roots. They emerged as \na response of these immigrant groups to protect themselves. They have \nevolved into sophisticated and lethal international operations that have \nspread throughout the United States, Mexico, and Central America, in \npart, as a result of U.S. policy of repatriating members to their home \ncountries after they serve out their prison sentences in the United States. El Salvador, for example, still receives an average of five airplanes of Steven S. Dudley| 42 |close to 100 repatriates a week, one U.S. official said; one airplane per \nweek is full of convicted criminals, he added.88\nThe United Nations and U.S. Southern Command estimate there \nare approximately 70,000 gang members, most of them concentrated in \nthe Northern Triangle: 36,000 in Honduras, 10,500 in El Salvador, and \n14,000 in Guatemala.89 The gangs have a grave impact on the security \nsituation in the region. Maras  extort, kidnap, and murder local rivals, \nneighbors and security personnel. Their grip on many communities has crippled them and forced governments to reassess their security \nstrategies. Their rise has also corresponded to higher murder rates. The \nNorthern Triangle currently ranks as the most dangerous place in the \nworld, according to the United Nations.\n90 However, assumptions that \nthese gangs are at the heart of this violence is somewhat flawed, and the belief that they play a significant role in drug trafficking is exaggerated.\nGang size and dynamics in each of these countries are different, \nhence their connections to DTOs are also different. Aside from being \none of many local distributors of illegal drugs, there is no evidence the \nGuatemala-based maras have any organic connection with the DTOs \nin that country. In Guatemala, the large DTOs have their strongest presence in precisely the areas where there is little mara activity. This \npattern generally repeats itself in Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. \nIn Honduras, there appears to be a stronger connection between the maras  and the DTOs, particularly as it relates to the use of the gangs \nas hired assassins. However, the evidence is almost purely anecdotal and largely unsubstantiated.\n91 In Southern Mexico and throughout \nCentral America, gangs have also worked closely with larger criminal \norganizations in human smuggling. While these ties still exist in Central \nAmerica, it seems that the Zetas have largely displaced the gangs in \nsouthern Mexico.92\nEl Salvador appears to be the country where the relationship between \nthe major DTOs and the gangs has advanced the most. Because of the growing evidence supporting this perception, this section focuses on El \nSalvador. The contacts between the maras and DTOs are potentially \ngame-changing in that country. El Salvador is also the spiritual heart of \nthe mara world in the region and where much of the leadership is based. \nFor reasons that will become clear, these gang leaders have the space Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 43 |and ability to shift from small neighborhood operations to international \nnarcotics traffickers, although that process is neither finished nor a \nforegone conclusion.\nThroughout the region, in particular in the Northern Triangle, \nthe governments have responded to the real and perceived threat of \ngangs with a so-called \u201c Mano Dura ,\u201d or \u201ciron fist,\u201d approach. In El \nSalvador, this included rounding up thousands of youth based on their appearance, associations, or address. Most of these arrests did not hold up in Salvadoran courts but served to further stigmatize already marginal \ncommunities and may have accelerated recruitment for the gangs \nthemselves.\n93 Far more troubling, from a criminology standpoint was the \neffect Mano Dura  had on the prison system, the mara leadership, and its \noperational structures.  \nMano Dura  operations were successful in jailing many mara  \u201csoldiers\u201d \nand leaders for everything from petty crimes to murder and extortion. By some estimates, between 2004 and 2008, the number of gang members \nin El Salvador\u2019s jails doubled from 4,000 to 8,000, representing about a \nthird of the total jail population. The already clogged and inadequate prison systems were overwhelmed.\n94 The jump in mara jail population \nstrained the system even further and immediately changed the dynamic \nof the prisons. The fighting on the street between the MS-13  and the \n18 spilled into the overcrowded jails. Hundreds died in several riots. \nThe authorities, seemingly desperate for a short-term solution, split the \ngroups up. Now, MS-13  and 18  members are sent to different prisons, a \nde facto nod to their increasing power and a de facto admission that the state was relatively powerless to stop them.\nGrouping the leaders and large portions of the hard-core soldiers \ntogether in Salvadoran jails had an additional effect, especially once the two gangs were separated. The leaders of these gangs had more time to \norganize, strategize, and plan their activities. They were safer in jail, \nfrom both their enemies and, ironically, from criminal prosecution. \nThey could communicate easier: Their near total control of the facilities \ngave them ready access to cellular phones, which they used to hold meetings with leaders in other jails via conference calls, as well as \nmessengers to pass more sensitive information. The facilities themselves \nwere also well-suited to their communications since they have electrical \noutlets throughout to recharge their cellular phones. The leadership of Steven S. Dudley| 44 |both gangs took advantage. They formed more hierarchical command \nstructures, reinforced old codes of conduct, and instituted new ones. \nThese included forbidding tattoos and instructing new initiates and cell \nleaders to dress less \u201cgang-like,\u201d i.e., blend in, which they have. \nThey also began entering new criminal territory, specifically \nextortions and kidnappings. These criminal activities are almost \nexclusively run from the prisons. The Salvadoran prosecutor in charge \nof the anti-extortion unit estimates that 84 percent of all extortion operations are run from jail.\n95 Some are very sophisticated rackets that \ntarget entire public transportation routes or transportation companies \nthat deliver food and beverages to poor neighborhoods. Others are \nquick hits of individuals that the gang members see on television, \nread about in the paper or hear about through the network of outside \ninformants that include other gang members, family, girlfriends, friends \nand other associates. The more sophisticated extortions involve multiple \nplayers, each with a specific role such as driver, lookout, pickup, and negotiator. Most of the money collected from these operations goes to \nthe gang leader in jail and his immediate circle of family, friends and \nclose associates. What\u2019s left goes to logistics and further operations. \nThese further operations include controlling drug distribution \nnetworks in mostly poor neighborhoods where the maras peddle crack, \npowder cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamines. The crack market is particularly lucrative and requires little infrastructure. The powdered cocaine is literally \u201ccooked\u201d in a frying pan with a mix of flour, \nbaking soda and various other ingredients so that it solidifies into what \ndistributors call a \u201ctortilla\u201d (the frying pan creates the circular shape that \nresembles the regional mainstay giving rise to its name). That \u201ctortilla\u201d \nis cut into a little more than a hundred pieces and sold at $3-$5 a unit. \nWhile academic observers and police intelligence officials all said \nthat maras  have long had a hand in this aspect of the drug trade, they \nalso acknowledged that the gangs are increasingly seeking to wrest total \ncontrol of this market from traditional distributors and that at least part, \nif not most, of the recent increase in El Salvador\u2019s homicide rate can be \nattributed to these battles.\n96 \nThere are indications that some mara leaders may be reaching further \nafield, trying to control bulk distribution. In September, authorities \narrested Moris Alexander Bercian Manchon, alias \u2018El Barny,\u2019 a leader Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 45 |of an MS-13  cell along the coast, carrying seven kilos of cocaine near \nLa Libertad, directly south of the capital.97 Seven kilos is very small, \nbut police intelligence said it was much higher than what maras  are used \nto managing. In addition, police intelligence sources said Bercian does \nnot normally operate in the area where he was arrested. He is part of \na Sonsonate cell known as La Normandy, one that has been gaining \npower with its own increased control over the local drug market in both \nSonsonate and La Libertad, two areas that may interest bigger players \nsuch as the Zetas because of their direct access to the Pacific Ocean and proximity to Guatemala.\n98\nPolice intelligence documents obtained by the author illustrate this \ntrend. In one document titled \u201c Los Zetas en El Salvador ,\u201d mara sources tell \nthe police that Bercian \u201chad moved up to the level of narco, that he was not just a gangbanger and that he was directing the gang\u2019s activities in \nSanta Tecla, the port in La Libertad, Ateos (sic), Sonsonate, Ahuachapan, \nSanta Ana, Quezaltepeque and Lourdes.\u201d\n99 The source says the mara cell \ncontrols the corridor from the Pacific to the border with Guatemala, \nincluding receiving product by boat.100\nThe same document says that another cell, the Fulton Locos Salvatruchas  \n(FLS), had sent 40 members to a farm in the Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala, near the Mexican border, to receive training from the Zetas. FLS are known \nas some of the most violent of the MS-13  cells. The document quotes \nan MS-13 leader warning authorities that in January 2010, an offensive \nwould begin.\n101 The leader did not specify what he meant but authorities \nare linking this threat, made in 2009, with a February 6 massacre in \nTonacatepeque, just north of San Salvador in which masked men armed \nwith M-16 semi-automatics and 9 mm pistols shot and killed six people \nin a restaurant. The massacre came a day after seven people were killed \nin a similar manner in Suchitoto, just northeast of Tonacatepeque. \nAnother police intelligence report obtained by the author said one of the \nvictims in the Tonacatepeque massacre was linked to a drug trafficking organization along the border with Guatemala, along the same corridor \npolice suspect the Zetas may be aiming to control.\n102\nThere was also a press report that the MS-13  has had meetings with \nthe Zetas in El Salvador. The story, based on a leaked police intelligence report, said gang leaders from four cells met with Gulf Cartel members \nat a bar in November 2008, where they discussed killing a transportista  Steven S. Dudley| 46 |who owed the Zetas money.103  It\u2019s not known if this meeting led to \nthe massacres in Toncatepeque or Suchitoto. Police intelligence said that \nthere may have been other meetings, including one in Guatemala with \nthe Zetas involving an MS-13  intermediary working with the gang in \nAhuachapan and Sonsonate. This intermediary was presumably trying to make direct contact with traffickers for the purpose of trafficking, \npolice intelligence says, not contract killings for hire.\n104\nPolice intelligence sources also say that the MS-13  are increasingly \nmaneuvering to gain territory in San Miguel and La Union, two eastern border provinces that are still thought to be under the control of the \nloose federation of tranportistas , Los Perrones . One theory of the MS-13 s \nexpansion in that area is that it is related to their attempts to gain control of the bulk distribution market along that border as well.\n105 Salvadorans \nfrom the MS-13  may also be reaching abroad. In August 2009, Costa \nRican authorities arrested MS-13 gang leader, Ivan Paz Jim\u00e9nez, with six \nkilos of cocaine. They charged him with drug possession and attempted \nkidnapping. Police intelligence sources say that Salvadoran gang leaders \nhave been located in Juarez and arrested in Nicaragua in drug cases but \ndid not reveal their identities as they form part of ongoing investigations \nin the United States.\nStill, many police and foreign agents cautioned that the gangs are \nstill very far from having the sophistication, discipline, and wherewithal to make good partners in the drug business. And they question the \nwidespread reports indicating that these gangs are being integrated into \nthe large criminal structures or are capable of creating and running their \nown structures. Case in point, they say, is the Bercian case. Bercian, \nwho was released in 2010 because a judge determined the means by which he was detained were illegal, did not look to his fellow gang \nmembers to create a criminal gang but rather took advantage of his \nfather\u2019s transportation business to try and enter the drug business.\n106 He \nhas since switched allegiances and works for the Sonsonate clique.107   \nSkeptics of the theories that tightly link gangs to organized crime also \nsuggest that gangs are not disciplined enough. To bolster their argument, they point to the gangs\u2019 modus operandi in kidnapping cases. In January \n2009, MS-13  members in Sonsonate bought several kilos of cocaine in \nbulk, and then kidnapped the middle-man, according to one foreign investigator. After the middle-man\u2019s cohorts paid the ransom, the gang Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 47 |killed the captive. To be sure, the MS-13 \u2019s kidnapping practice illustrates \nvery little infrastructure and discipline. Police and foreign agents say that \nthe gang kills between 80 and 90 percent of their victims because they \ntake little precaution in concealing their identities and have nowhere to \nkeep victims once they have them in their possession. In addition, gangs \nalso tend to attract the most law enforcement attention, making alliances \nwith them risky.   \nInvestigators, police intelligence and academics also emphasized the \noften great variance from gang to gang in operations and sophistication, and the multiple subsets that exist in each of the two major mara  groups. \nSome cells are more organized and disciplined. Some are more violent and disorganized. Some are more wealthy and entrepreneurial. The \ndifferences are causing divisions within the gangs. Many are starting to \nquestion the status quo, leading to violent and bloody battles both inside \nand outside of the prisons. A few gang leaders in the street appear to be freelancing, searching for business opportunities, rather than following \ndirect orders from the jails. The press report on the MS-13  and Zetas \nmeeting said the gang leaders spoke openly about differences with the leadership. These differences may also be what are fueling part of the \nincrease in homicides.\n108\nRegardless of the questions surrounding the gangs\u2019 involvement \nin the upper echelons of organized crime or their ability to take over \nbulk distribution of illegal narcotics, there is much evidence pointing \nto their increasing financial and firepower. Police intelligence says that \nmara leaders have purchased apartments, car washes, used car dealerships, \ndiscos, bars, and restaurants in an attempt to launder proceeds and conceal their drug, kidnap, car theft and extortion businesses. They have \nalso made vehicles and properties available for common use, illustrating their tendency toward subsuming personal gain for the creation of a \nlarger, more sophisticated criminal network.\n109\nOn the weapons side, police have seen an uptick in the use of M-16 \nassault rifles and military issue grenades in recent attacks. In the first two weeks of last year, police confiscated four M-67 grenades and four \ngrenade launchers, among other armaments. Maras  are also suspected \nto have tossed grenades at several businesses in the last few months, a warning to shopkeepers who do not pay their quotas on time. Some \npolice theorize that the gangs may be getting this armament from Steven S. Dudley| 48 |more sophisticated groups, such as the Zetas, as suggested in the \naforementioned intelligence report.110 But the black market arms market \nin El Salvador is so big; it is hard to pinpoint the origin of the weapons.111\nThe maras  have also become more politically savvy. While in most \ncommunities their power is still based on fear and retribution, one \njournalist noted an increasing tendency to reach out to the community. \nIn one neighborhood in San Salvador, he said the mara  leader was also a \nmember of the community organization.112 In recent years, maras have \nalso opened themselves up to academic and non-governmental studies, \nincreasing their ties to these organizations in the process. \nThe NGO community, in particular one known as the Fundaci\u00f3n de \nEstudios para la Aplicaci\u00f3n de Derecho (FESPAD), has begun an ongoing \ndialogue with the mara  leaders, becoming organizers and advocates of \ntheir rights inside and outside of jail. Salvadoran President Mauricio \nFunes tapped several FESPAD leaders to work with his government on security issues, thereby formalizing this push towards what has been \ncalled a \u201cdialogue.\u201d In February 2010, leaders from the MS-13  and the \n18 issued a joint press release calling for negotiations, and several sources inside the government confirmed that it had been meeting with the \nmara leaders inside the prisons.\n113\nHowever, Funes\u2019 administration has remained firm. After congress \npassed new, tough anti-gang legislation, the president signed it into law in \nSeptember 2010. The gangs responded by blocking buses and paralyzing \ntransportation throughout the country.114 They then apologized, but \nSalvadorans\u2019 patience may be wearing thin. Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 49 |Money, Efforts, and Challenges\nAs part of the M\u00e9rida Initiative, the U.S. Govermment allocated $248 \nmillion for Central America in FY2008 and FY2010. That money is now \nshifted to the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), \nwhich is separate from the M\u00e9rida Initiative. But little has changed aside \nfrom the name. Most of the money still goes to Guatemala, Honduras, \nand El Salvador. It is split between institution-building, rule of law \nand development programs on the one hand, and anti-gang and anti-\nnarcotics enforcement on the other. \nThe list of goals, as described the State Department,  \nare as follows:\n1. Create safe streets for the citizens in the region \n2. Disrupt the movement of criminals and contraband within and  \n between the nations of Central America  \n3. Support the development of strong, capable, and accountable    Central American governments  \n4. Re-establish effective state presence and security in communities  \n at risk  \n5. Foster enhanced levels of security and rule of law coordination   and cooperation between the nations of the region\n115\nSpecifically, the United States is concentrating on fortifying the \njustice systems as well as pushing through changes in the legal codes \nto facilitate modern crime fighting techniques, prosecutions, and, it \nhopes, extraditions. On the policing side, the United States is aiming \nat improving port, airport, and border security, and helping the local \ngovernments mount more effective interdiction efforts with fixed and \nmobile inspection equipment. With an eye on gangs, the United States \nis also trying to increase the use of databases and community policing and to improve prison management. It is also focused on information \nsharing, which includes increasing access to the United States\u2019 own files \non repatriated gang members, and developing a regional fingerprint \nanalysis system. \nThe funds represent a substantial increase over previous years. In \nFY2007, for example, the only Central American countries to receive Steven S. Dudley| 50 |counternarcotics funds were Guatemala ($1.9 million) and Panama \n($3.3 million). Now, each of the seven countries \u2013 Belize, Guatemala, \nEl Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama \u2013 get roughly \n$12 million each. The new funds, however, will hardly change the \ngame, especially given that some of these countries are starting with few \nresources. \nConsider Honduras. Only in 2010, did some Honduran naval and \nair force get the equipment to operate at night and even then for a limited time.\n116 Wiretapping laws are in place, but the organized crime \nunit at the attorney general\u2019s office said it does not have the equipment \nand complains that the private telephone companies will not supply it. \nWhat\u2019s more, the law requires all tapping to have a judge\u2019s permission, \nsomething local and foreign investigators say they would avoid because of \nthe possible information leaks. The Honduran Public Security Ministry \nsays the strategy is to send a message by capturing top-level guys. It is a \nlong road, however. In Honduras, there is not even a case against Juan Natividad \u201cChepe\u201d Luna, one of El Salvador\u2019s most wanted transportistas  \nwho authorities say operates in both El Salvador and Honduras. \nThere\u2019s also a notable shift away from reforming the police through \nmassive training programs. In Guatemala, the United States seems to have embraced a different model. Working in tandem with the \nCommission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), a UN-sanctioned \njudicial international body that works side by side with Guatemalan investigators and police, the two are trying to develop and fortify cells \nof highly trained, vetted prosecutors and police. The hope is that these \ncells of \u201cuntouchables\u201d will eventually head the institutions, and that \nthey can lead reform from within. For its part, the CICIG is working \nwith 12 prosecutors and 20 policemen. So far, however, its efforts have \nborne more fruit with the prosecutors than the police. Ten police were \ndismissed from the CICIG program without explanation, and CICIG officials said that no major cases have come from their relationship with \nthe police.\n117\nThe United States Government has had good success working with \nlocal governments to change legal codes so they allow for more modern crime fighting techniques such as wiretapping, undercover operations \nand controlled buys of narcotics. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \nhas helped design legislation that would permit judges to grant leniency Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 51 |to cooperating witnesses and has started to create effective witness \nprotection programs, which, in the case of Guatemala, include specially \ntrained police to act as \nmarshals. The DOJ is also \nassisting in the creation of \nFinancial Intelligence Units \nin the various government \nprosecutors\u2019 offices throughout the region, to \nhead up local and cross-\nborder money laundering \ninvestigations.\nGuatemala, Honduras, \nand El Salvador have each \nupdated laws to close legal loopholes that permitted the \nimportation of ephedrine \nproducts. There\u2019s still a \nneed for updated search and \nseizure laws in many of these \ncountries so authorities can \nbetter squeeze traffickers via their assets and bank \naccounts. Extraditions are \nalso difficult to negotiate \nand, in the case of \nHonduras, not allowed in \nthe constitution. Part of this \nis due to the United States\u2019 historical record of taking \nunilateral actions against \ntraffickers in other countries \nwhen the United States feels \nthe local judicial systems \nhave failed.\nInstitutional success stories, however, are hard to find in the region. \nMany point to Nicaragua as a model. In a series of raids in 2006 and Extradition\nFollowing the murder of DEA agent Enrique \nCamarena in 1985, the United States Government took several unilateral actions that still color relations between the United States and Central America. The United States indicted 22 individuals for Camarena\u2019s murder, including Juan Matta Ballesteros, but investigations into the case stalled in Mexico, and while some arrests were made and prosecutions followed, no one was extradited. Frustrated, the DEA paid Mexican bounty hunters to kidnap one of the suspects, Humberto Alvarez Macha\u00edn, in clear violation of the country\u2019s extradition treaty with the U.S., and bring him to the United States to face charges. Alvarez Macha\u00edn was a doctor by profession. His role in the drug ring and the kidnapping and death of Camarena was far from clear, and, in Mexico, he\u2019d avoided prosecution. In 1988, DEA agents also illegally apprehended Juan Ram\u00f3n Matta Ballesteros in Honduras, put him on an airplane and flew him to the United States to face murder charges. In both Mexico and Honduras, the DEA\u2019s extrajudicial actions led to massive diplomatic and, in the case of Honduras, civilian protests. Honduran protestors burned a portion of the United States embassy to the ground, and Honduras remains one of the few countries in the region that does not allow extraditions. Mexico has only recently initiated extraditions to the U.S., but the Machain case still resonates: the DEA, for instance, is not authorized to participate in law enforcement operations in Mexico.  Steven S. Dudley| 52 |2007, authorities arrested dozens of local and foreign traffickers and \ndecommissioned boats, weapons, and ammunition in the process. The \nraids at least temporarily disabled the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s operations in that \ncountry.118 In 2009, a similar series of raids occurred dismantling what \nwas said to be a Zetas\u2019 operation.119\nIn El Salvador, the one major success that officials and observers \npoint to is anti-kidnapping unit. The unit, with help from the private \nsector \u2013 which provided extra vehicles, radios, and other equipment \n\u2013 steadily unhinged the then organized criminal gangs that were \nkidnapping mostly wealthy Salvadorans for ransom. Kidnapping, which \nhit a high of 101 known cases in 2000, dropped to 6 in 2004, according \nto police officials. The unit eventually morphed into the anti-narcotics  \nunit, where it has had less success. In FY2008, authorities captured a \nmere 26 kilos of cocaine. In FY2009, authorities captured less than two \nmetric tons. \nThe public prosecutor\u2019s office in Guatemala has also seen some \nimprovement. With the help of the CICIG, the office has arrested two \npolice chiefs for their involvement in drug trafficking activities, as well \nas a former president and a former defense minister who are accused of \nembezzlement. However, the CICIG project, is dependent on securing more resources, security and insulating the Guatemalan prosecutors \nfrom political shifts, three variables that may put continued success in \nbreaking the wall of impunity in that country in jeopardy.\nOverall, despite tough talk from its presidents, the region seems ill \nprepared to face what is arguably a bigger threat to regional security than \nthe civil wars of the 1980s.  In many ways, Central American countries \nare fighting against simple economics. An estimated $38 billion in cocaine flows from South to North America. The U.S. Government \nestimates that 42 percent of these drugs, representing $16 billion, pass \nthrough Central America, more than national government expenditures \nof Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador combined in 2009.\n120 Fifty-\nnine percent of Hondurans live below the poverty line; 56 percent live below the poverty line in Guatemala; and 31 percent live below the \npoverty line in El Salvador.\n121 The poverty, mixed with the lawless \nenvironment that presides over the region, makes it an ideal place for the \nDTOs to operate. Murder rates in the Northern Triangle are some of \nthe highest in the world. Impunity reigns. Few crimes are investigated. Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 53 |Fewer are resolved. In Guatemala, for instance, of the 6,451 murders in \n2009, investigators resolved just 256. \nThere is also widespread discontent and distrust of the security \nforces throughout the region. Just to cite one example, a recent poll \nin El Salvador by Vanderbilt\u2019s Latin American Public Opinion Project \n(LAPOP) found that over 41 percent of respondents did not report a \ncrime because they thought it would do no good; nearly 25 percent did \nnot report crimes because they feared reprisals.122 Multiple attempts to \nreform police have also done little to slow the pace of crime or corruption \ninside the forces. Many corrupt officers in Guatemala were purged, only \nto be recycled back into the police later.123 \nPolice have also become highly politicized and unstable in much of \nthe region. In Guatemala, the Portillo administration (2000-2004) had eight national police chiefs, the Berger administration (2004-2008) had \nthree police chiefs, and Alvaro Colom has already had five since entering \noffice. In El Salvador, the new police that formed after peace talks mixed \ndifferent factions, including 20 percent from the demobilized guerrillas. \nBy the early 2000s, the conservative ARENA party had removed most of the former guerrillas and politicized the top police posts, analysts say. \nThe party denies this, but during the 2009 elections it selected a former \npolice chief as its presidential candidate.\nThe private sector also appears unwilling to help the governments. \nGuatemala\u2019s government has been unable to pass a tax reform bill to help \nit beef up its security forces and put money into social services, education, \nand youth programs. Instead private money is going into a multi-billion dollar private security industry that is growing exponentially. For his \npart, Salvadoran President Funes, one of the region\u2019s most popular \nleaders, has little support from the business elite. After he was elected, \nthe private sector pulled its support from the special anti-crime unit it \nonce generously funded, particularly when that unit was the target of \nkidnapping rings.\nThe massive crime wave seems to have overwhelmed an undermanned, \nunder-resourced security system throughout the region. Honduras and Guatemala have the two lowest ratios of police per population. Honduras \nhas the second lowest ratio of police per square kilometer. This translates \ninto some difficult challenges. For example, Olancho, a Honduran Steven S. Dudley| 54 |province bigger than El Salvador, has 250 police. Other places are simply \nundermanned given the task they are facing. Alta Verapaz, for example, \nhas 415 policemen, but only 60-65 percent are on duty at any one time.124 \nThe province is one of the headquarters of the Zetas in Guatemala.\nTable: Police Ratios in Central America and Mexico\nCountry PopulationPolice per 1000 \ninhabitantsPolice per km2\nGuatemala 13,276,000 1.5 0.47\nEl Salvador 7,185,000 2.5 2.2\nHonduras 7,834,000 1.2 0.21\nNicaragua 5,891,000 1.7 0.19\nPanama 3,360,000 5.1 0.59\nCosta Rica 4,254,000 2.6 0.22\nMexico 111,212,000 3.3 0.52\nSources: author interviews; Observatoriopara la violencia, Honduras; CIA World \nFactbook.\nBeing undermanned only partially explains the police\u2019s difficulties. \nHigh and low level police have been tied to several criminal groups, \nincluding Los Perrones  in El Salvador and the Zetas in Guatemala. It is a \nvicious circle. Those who are trying to implement reform face a culture of corruption, fear and low morale, all of which feed the circle. \u201cAs long \nas we keep kicking them like stray dogs, they\u2019ll keep biting us,\u201d one \nmember of a commission to reform police in Guatemala said.\n125\nFear, however, may be harder to overcome. In Guatemala, 29 national \npolice officers and 9 prison guards were murdered in the line of duty in the first 10 months of 2009.\n126 In December, Honduras\u2019 drug czar, \nretired General Julian Aristides Gonzalez, was assassinated shortly after he had dropped off his daughter at her Tegucigalpa school. Gonzalez had \ndenounced police involvement in trafficking activities for months prior \nto his assassination. Current Honduran Security Minister Oscar Alvarez \nsays he has received threats from the Zetas. In El Salvador, when police \nofficials and prosecutors recommended recently that the government \nrewire the prisons to ensure that inmates cannot recharge their cellular Drug Trafficking Organizations in Central America: \nTransportistas, Mexican Cartels, and Maras | 55 |phones \u2013 a measure they believe will greatly decrease the ability of the \ngangs to communicate and extort from the inside \u2013 prison officials \nbalked saying they worried about riots.127\nIn the end, the DTOs are one of many organized criminal groups and \narguably not even the biggest threat. In contrast to the street gangs that regularly extort small shopkeepers, food delivery trucks, and bus drivers, \nthe traffickers run a relatively harmless operation and are sometimes \nviewed as local heroes. When traffickers do make public appearances, it \nis often to spend money. In Cob\u00e1n, Guatemala, traffickers such as Hearst \nWalter Overdick regularly appear in bars and discotheques, sometimes \nwith a police escort. In some cases, the popular support is not so subtle. When the DEA mounted an operation to capture Waldemar Lorenzana \nin Zacapa in January, it was met by a dozen protestors. An hour later, \nthere were 200 people blocking the DEA\u2019s access. Lorenzana got away, \neven though he was just 50 yards from where the DEA had to stop. \n128\nEndnotes\n1 An earlier version of this paper appeared in \u201cShared Responsibility: U.S.-\nMexico Policy Options for Confronting Organized Crime.\u201d Edited by Eric L. \nOlson, David A.

Steven S. Dudley| 56 |8  Perhaps the most well known pioneer of these routes was Sandra Avila \nBeltr\u00e1n. According to Colombian authorities, the so-called \u201cQueen of the Pacific,\u201d \nAvila Beltr\u00e1n, through her Colombian accomplice, Juan Diego Espinosa, moved \nhundreds of metric tons of cocaine in go-fasts. In December 2010, a Mexican \njudge acquitted Avila Beltr\u00e1n and Espinosa, who had already been extradited to the United States. Avila Beltr\u00e1n remains in custody, as authorities contemplate extraditing her to the United States.

One former Tijuana Cartel operative, for instance, told the author that he would buy cocaine at $2,000 in Colombia and sell it at the U.S. border for $20,000, avoiding the middlemen en route and subsequent markups.\n11  Beginning with President Alvaro Uribe\u2019s ascension in August 2002, \nColombia has extradited over 1000 suspected traffickers to the United States, including over 30 AUC leaders. Numerous more have turned themselves in to authorities in third countries prior to being captured and extradited.  \n12  In the latest example of this, in December 2010, Colombian Special \nForces ambushed ERPAC forces in eastern Colombia, killing the group\u2019s top leader, Pedro Guerrero Castillo, alias \u2018Cuchillo.\u2019 (See: \u201cColombian Police: \u2018Cuchillo\u2019 is Dead,\u201d InSight , December 28, 2010; http://www.insightcrime.org/\ninsight-latest-news/item/387-cuchillo-killed-by-police) \n13  \u201cAs\u00ed operan las alas de la mafia ,\u201d El Tiempo , February 14, 2010.\n14  \u201cRawFeed: WikiLeaks Casts New Light on Old Problem,\u201d InSight , \nFebruary 21, 2011.

Nobody has a precise \nnumber, but the best estimates predict that several hundred tons of cocaine will transit Honduras in 2010, of which less than 10 percent will \nbe seized by authorities.\n1 In its wake, well-funded transnational criminal \norganizations combined with local gangs are destabilizing the country\u2019s \ndemocratic institutions and making it one of the most dangerous \ncountries in the world in terms of violent crime.\nSince the 1970s, Honduran criminal organizations focused on getting \ndrugs\u2014particularly cocaine\u2014in, around, and through Honduras, \ntaking a cut of the profit along the way. Honduran Juan Ram\u00f3n Matta \nBallesteros ran a key organization trafficking cocaine in the early 1980s between Colombia and Mexico.\n2 At times in the late 1980s and 1990s, \nColombian groups such as Pablo Escobar\u2019s Medell\u00edn Cartel or the Fuerzas \nArmadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Revolutionary Armed Forces of \nColombia, or FARC) exercised management, influence, and oversight in \nthe trafficking in Honduras, but the power generally remained with the \nHonduran transportistas .3\nIn the past decade, a crackdown on drug trafficking \norganizations in Colombia combined with the rise of increasingly \npowerful Mexican cartels stretching their influence into Central \nAmerica has impacted the trafficking situation in Honduras.4 \nIllicit flights from South America and boats with cocaine moving up both coasts have increased. Youth gangs in Honduras provide the \ntraffickers with organizations that can intimidate and murder for cheap. \nThe Sinaloa Cartel bought or forced its management influence over a \nnumber of previously Honduran controlled trafficking routes. The Zetas Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 63 |followed suit. While most traffickers in Honduras are Honduran, a large \nportion of the management is now believed to be Mexican.\nThe public security situation in Honduras is among the worst in the \nworld, ranking among the top five nations with the highest number of \nviolent crimes and murders per capita. The government estimates that \none person is killed every 88 minutes.5  The 2010 UNODC reported \nthat the province of Atl\u00e1ntida, which includes the port city of La Ceiba, \nwas among the most violent in the Western Hemisphere, with 1 person \nout of every 1,000 killed in violence crimes.6  Honduras, followed by \nMexico, were the two most dangerous countries in Latin America for \njournalists in 2010, superseded only by Pakistan and Iraq.7 In 2010, the \ncountry\u2019s counter-drug czar was killed by a Mexican Drug Trafficking Organization (DTO) and a plot was broken up to assassinate the \ncountry\u2019s Minister of Security. \nTo complicate matters, the turmoil in Honduras\u2019 political system over \nthe past two years has opened space for increased organized crime activity. \nAn institutional battle, a military coup, and ongoing complications about \nthe international recognition of Honduras\u2019s government have dissuaded \nthe aid and cooperation believed necessary to fight organized crime.\nWhy Honduras?\nThe importance of Honduras in the trafficking of illicit drugs is that \nit serves as a key location for exchange between traffickers and for \nmanagement of cocaine transfers between the Andes and North America. \nCocaine coming from South America to Honduras is trafficked by many \ngroups, from large well-known Colombian organizations to micro-\ncartels to a small number of individuals trying to make a quick buck.\nHonduras is often the location where the handoff is made, but a \nlarge Mexican criminal organization controls the cocaine trafficking from Honduras to Mexico, across the border into the United States, \nand increasingly the distribution inside the United States. The Mexican \ncontrol of shipments as they come in by sea and air on the Caribbean \nCoast of Honduras has been described as a \u201ccommand and control\u201d \nlocation for the Mexican cartels.\n8James Bosworth| 64 |Similarly, shipments of pseudoephedrine (a precursor chemical for \nthe production of methamphetamine) entering Honduras receive greater \noversight or are directly controlled by the larger cartels in Mexico.9 \nDespite the Honduran government\u2019s efforts to halt the pseudoephedrine trade, the DTOs have pushed meth production into Central America in \nresponse to relatively effective enforcement efforts by U.S. and Mexican \nauthorities further north to control the precursor chemicals. Likewise, \npseudoephedrine shipments from Europe or directly from Asia are being \nrouted to Honduras. Additionally, certain shipments that go to the \nSouthern Cone of South America are controlled by the Sinaloa Cartel through the entire hemisphere, and regions of Honduras, particularly \nthe Olancho department, have been used by Sinaloa to manufacture \necstasy and meth before shipping it to the United States or Europe.\nFrom Honduras to the north, most shipments head through Guatemala \nby land or to Guatemala or Mexico by sea, departing from areas near \nLa Ceiba. In general, according to experts who track the shipments, \nthe Sinaloa and Gulf Cartels move more cocaine by land across the Honduras-Guatemala border, while the Zetas move more by sea.\n10\nWhile the following sections of this paper describe the specific \ninfluence of the Mexican DTOs and other international organizations, \nthere remains a thriving \u201cindependent\u201d industry of transportistas  in which \npeople unassociated with specific DTOs move cocaine up the coast and sell it at a higher price to DTOs further north. Groups as small as 2 and \nas large as 25, usually composed of Nicaraguans or Hondurans, purchase \ncocaine in southern parts of Central America (Panama, Costa Rica, or \nNicaragua) from organizations managed by Colombian and Venezuelan DTOs.  They then move the cocaine up the coast to Honduras or \nGuatemala, where they sell it at a profit on the black market that is run \nby the Sinaloa, Gulf, and Zetas organizations.\nOne such micro-DTO, the Re\u00f1azcos, is a Honduran family that \noperates mostly on the Nicaraguan side of the border, transporting \ncocaine by land and sea through Nicaraguan territory and into Honduras. \nOnce they move the cocaine into Honduras, they transfer control of the drugs to the Mexican DTOs. Although small in size, the Re\u00f1azcos \norganization has been operating for almost a decade. In 2004 it killed \nseveral police officers in the Nicaraguan Caribbean city of Bluefields. Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 65 |The Nicaraguan government claimed in late 2010 that the group tried to \nbreak several drug traffickers out of prison in that region.11\nThe Sinaloa Cartel\nThe Sinaloa Cartel exercises most of its management authority in the Northern triangle of Central America, with Honduras playing a key \nrole. The cartel also has some significant influence at the base of the \ntrafficking chain in Peru and, to a lesser extent, in Colombia.\n12\nPolice intelligence reports suggest the Sinaloa Cartel has installed \noperations in the states of Cop\u00e1n, Santa B\u00e1rbara, Col\u00f3n, Olancho, and \nGracias a Dios. In late 2009, the U.S. Department of Treasury froze the \nassets of Agust\u00edn Reyes Garza, \u201cDon Pilo,\u201d a member of the Sinaloa \nCartel operating in Honduras.\nIn 2007 and 2008, it is believed that the cartel began buying off \nor killing potential local rivals. A top cartel leader was sent down to \nHonduras with a group of Mexican sicarios , or hitmen, over a 15 day \nperiod to kill off Honduran rivals. That leader then set up a \u201csicario \nschool\u201d in Honduras that recruited local operatives to continue providing \nsecurity and protection for Sinaloa operations.13\nIn 2008, a massacre by the Zetas on the Guatemala-El Salvador \nborder led to rumors that Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, a leader of the \nSinaloa cartel, was among those killed. The Guatemalan government \ninvestigated and denied that he was among the dead, but said he was in \nHonduras.14 While rumors of El Chapo\u2019s trips to Honduras had quietly \ncirculated previously, the open acknowledgement of his presence by a Central American government raised the stakes for the Honduran \ngovernment.\n15\nIn early 2010, the Honduran government confirmed the rumors and \nrevealed that the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s top leader had been known to travel \nto Honduras and reside in the country at various times. Beginning in \nFebruary 2006, Guzm\u00e1n had used locations in Honduras, particularly \nSanta Barbara, to avoid authorities in Mexico and Guatemala. The news \nthat one of the world\u2019s top cartel leaders apparently had relative freedom \nof movement, at least in areas of Mexico and Central America, was \ndeeply troubling.James Bosworth| 66 |There are those who doubt the information and believe the Honduran \nand Guatemalan governments are using the potential presence of \u201cEl \nChapo\u201d as a way to gain attention and leverage resources from the \nUnited States.\nNevertheless, Guzm\u00e1n apparently established a location in El Esp\u00edritu, \nCop\u00e1n near the Guatemalan border. When he visited, he maintained \npersonal security guards with inside knowledge of government \noperations that warned him well in advance if authorities were in the area. The location allowed him to avoid Guatemalan authorities, which \noriginally arrested him in the early 1990s and have continued to search \nfor him passing through their territory.\n16\nThe Honduran government promised that if it were to capture Guzm\u00e1n \nor any other top cartel leaders it would extradite him immediately to \nMexico.17 Authorities acknowledged that their prison system could not \nlikely hold those criminal leaders.\nThe Sinaloa Cartel has used Honduras as a base for meth and ecstasy \nproduction.18  Authorities in late 2009 found a lab in Naco Santa Barbara \nwith a very well-constructed runway nearby that had been in operation for three years. Planes were reportedly taking off and landing to bring in \npseudoephedrine and leave with ecstasy and other drugs. The location \nwas owned by 15 Mexicans, and some property transfers at that location \nhad taken place through the bodyguard of a member of Congress. Police \nindicated that there were military units aware of the location that had \nbeen corrupted through bribes by the traffickers and did not report the \nlocation to their superiors.\nIn December 2009, Honduras\u2019s drug czar, Juli\u00e1n Ar\u00edstides Gonz\u00e1lez, \nwas assassinated. Evidence revealed that the Sinaloa Cartel had likely taken out the hit on him.\n19 Investigators believe they used local \norganizations, not Mexican sicarios , to actually commit the crime.\nIn the weeks prior to his assassination, the drug czar had been cracking \ndown on operations that were directly managed by the Sinaloa Cartel. Clandestine runways operated by the organization were destroyed in \npublic events with the media. Hondurans trafficking cocaine between \nthe runways and the Guatemalan border were targeted and arrested and \nthe cocaine seized.\nHonduran prosecutors have also surmised that what motivated the \nSinaloa Cartel to assassinate the counter-narcotics director was the Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 67 |seizure of a shipment of illicit pseudophedrine that was coming in to \nHonduras from France for use in producing meth or ecstasy. The cartel \nsupposedly lost US$7 million on that seizure, which was headed for the \nfacility in Naco described above.20\nMinister of Security \u00d3scar \u00c1lvarez has warned that the Sinaloa Cartel \nis attempting to buy off mayors and municipal officials while corrupting \npolice officers. In that way, it is trying to create \u201cparallel government \nstructures\u201d at local levels that will allow it a greater freedom to operate.\nReporting on the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s activities, particularly its corruption \nof government officials, has become dangerous for Honduran reporters. \nJournalist Nahun Palacios of Radio Tocoa and Canal 5 in Col\u00f3n was \nkilled in March 2010. David Meza was killed near the port of La Ceiba after reporting on Sinaloa cartel activities in the area. Both had received \nthreats from the drug trafficking organization prior to their deaths.\n21\nThe Zetas\nLike the Sinaloa Cartel, the Gulf Cartel was active in Honduras \nthroughout the past decade, but began expanding operations significantly \nin 2006. With the break between the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas in \nMexico, the Zetas took over many of the operations inside of Honduras. \nThey maintained ties with corrupt officials and kept track of the land \ntitles and routes landing air and sea shipments in Honduras.\nFollowing the split between the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas, the former \ncontinued operations in Central America. However, according to local \nofficials, the Gulf Cartel tends to traffic through and around Honduras, \nwith less infrastructure or personnel within the country as compared to the Sinaloa Cartel or the Zetas. With less of a permanent presence, they \ntend to avoid conflicts with other criminal organizations in Honduras. \nRecent reports suggest the Gulf Cartel tends to pick up cocaine in Costa \nRica and Nicaragua and traffic it through Honduran territory by land \nand sea using local Central American transportista  groups.\n22 They maintain \na small group of several dozen Honduran sicarios , some of which they use \nin Nicaragua and Costa Rica to provide enforcement and protection.James Bosworth| 68 |In early 2010, Security Minister \u00c1lvarez said that the Zetas had placed \na price on his head for his efforts to crack down on organized crime.23 \nThey were allegedly working with the street gang Barrio 18. The note \nseized by authorities from within Barrio 18 read in part, \u201cLet\u2019s try and \ndo this job as soon as possible\u2026 since our \u2018friends\u2019 the Zetas gave us a \n$20,000 advance and said they would give us another $150,000 if we do \nthis job well.\u201d\nAround the same time as the plot to assassinate \u00c1lvarez, Honduran \nauthorities said that members of the Zeta leadership from Mexico may \nhave been using areas of Cop\u00e1n to hide personnel and as staging locations for drug trafficking operations. However, the authorities were unable to \nconfirm these rumors.\n24\nLike the Sinaloa Cartel, the Zetas have begun managing clandestine \nrunways and transportation networks in Honduras. The country has become a key transfer point to take control of the cocaine as it heads \nnorthward into Mexico and then the United States. While some of the \nZetas\u2019 land routes overlap with the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s, the organization \nappears to prefer trafficking by sea, leaving from the area in or around La \nCeiba and going to Guatemala, where they have better control of land \nroutes, or all the way to Mexico.\n25\nAs was exemplified by the tragic massacre of 72 migrants, many of \nwhom were Honduran, in Tamaulipas, Mexico in September 2010, the \nZetas also play an important role in the illicit smuggling of migrants \nin Central America and Mexico. Reports began surfacing in 2008 in \nHonduras that the Zetas were kidnapping Hondurans in Guatemala or \nas they crossed the border from Honduras to Guatemala.26 Some people \nclaim they were tricked into believing the Zetas were functioning as \ncoyotes while others say they were outright kidnapped by force. Zetas \nwould force the migrants to take on criminal tasks such as working \nfor the cartel for a certain amount of time or trafficking drugs into the \nUnited States. Women have been forced into prostitution and sexually \nassaulted by the criminals engaged in their trafficking. At times, the \nZetas would contact families of those kidnapped back in Honduras and demand ransom.\nBy 2010, Zeta networks extended further into Honduras, including \nactive violent cells in San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba, logistics networks Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 69 |along the Caribbean coast, and some land purchases both near the \nGuatemalan border and in rural areas of Western Honduras.\nMedia reports indicate that the Zetas have recruited a number of \nformer Honduran police officers to provide security for drug trafficking \nas well as for the kidnapping and extortion of migrants. 27 The presence \nof former Honduran police goes beyond Honduras\u2019s borders and includes cells in Guatemala and Mexico, according to Honduran and Mexican \nauthorities.\nIt may seem logical that an increasing Zeta presence would clash \nwith the more established presence in Honduras of the Sinaloa Cartel, \nas well as local Honduran transportista  groups. Information about turf \nwars, however, was not readily available other than the Sinaloa activity \nin 2008 referenced previously. The battles that occur among rival cartels \nand local groups appear to be individual instances with specific motives, \nnot part of a long running feud where one group is out to destroy the \nother. Suppliers, local transportistas  and maras  do not seem to be forced \nto \u201cchoose sides\u201d between the major Mexican groups that are in the country and are still allowed to freely work among the groups where \nwork is available.\nEven without long-running turf wars, the Zeta\u2019s presence and \nmethods have meant that over the course of 2010 the Zetas have received greater media coverage in Honduras. Not content with quiet \ninfluence similar to the Sinaloa Cartel, the Zetas have apparently tried to \nintimidate gangs and local transportista  groups in northwest Honduras and \nclaim certain routes as their own.\n28 These actions, combined with their \nbrutal kidnapping and exploitation on the human trafficking routes, are \ncreating a backlash against the group in Honduras.\nThe Maras\nHonduras has the largest number of individuals involved in gangs ( maras \nor pandillas ) in Central America, whether measured in terms of overall \nnumbers or on a per capita basis. A 2005 estimate by the UNODC said \nthat the number of gang members in Honduras was about 36,000. 29  The James Bosworth| 70 |gangs are engaged in significant amounts of crime, particularly in the \nurban neighborhoods of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. \nThe two largest gangs in Honduras, MS-13 and Mara-18, are branches \nof the transnational gangs by those same names. Unlike El Salvador, \nwhere those two gangs and a few others dominate the entire mara landscape, authorities in Honduras estimate that over 100 different gangs \nexist in the country. Most of those gangs are local neighborhood groups \nthat have horizontal ties with other local gangs in the country but lack the transnational scope of the largest gangs or the organized criminal \ngroups that traffic most of the cocaine.\nVanda Felbab-Brown of The Brookings Institution believes that a \ncollaborative relationship has developed over time between the criminal \nnetworks and the maras  by which leaders of the networks subcontract \nspecific tasks to the maras.\n30 Transnational DTOs use those local \ngangs as \u201cmuscle,\u201d doing temporary one-off jobs to kill or intimidate \ncompetition or government forces, provide security for shipments, or \nprovide personnel to move a shipment across a certain location. A report \nby the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB, Junta Internacional \nde Fiscalizaci\u00f3n de Estupefacientes  or JIFE in Spanish) suggested that most \ntransnational drug trafficking organizations in Central America are \nusing local gangs primarily for security protection.31\nAnalysts will at times note that the gangs have extensive ties with \norganized crime and international drug trafficking organizations. However, there is also an important level of separation between \nthem. In the eyes of U.S. and Honduran officials interviewed for \nthis report, the gangs aren\u2019t coordinated or trustworthy enough \nto be offered a major part in the regional trafficking process.\n32 \nThe gangs are much more local in their scope of activities.\nHowever, there is an opposing view: that the gangs are more organized \nand have begun working apart from Sinaloa and Zeta control of the drug \nsmuggling routes. Honduran Attorney General Roy David Urtecho said \nduring a recent law enforcement conference:\n\u201cNow they [MS-13 and M-18] wanted the real power. They had been seeking an understanding with the cartels in Mexico and Colombia, to establish themselves as legitimate traffickers instead of \nstreet level thugs\u2026 Once they had control over the level of violence Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 71 |in the country, they began to implement a system of bosses and \nsubordinates; they went from hiring themselves out as the armed \nbranches of various foreign criminal organizations to fully operating \nall criminal activities in Honduras. Even as we speak, they have a \ncomplete monopoly over the violence and drug smuggling routes in \nthe country.\u201d33\nWhether or not they are independent from the Mexican DTOs on the \ntransnational routes, there is agreement that the maras control the local \ndistribution for drugs. Local health statistics suggest that slightly less than one percent of the population abuses cocaine, which is not high by \ndeveloped nation standards but among the highest in Central America, \naccording to the UNODC.\n34 Honduras provides a big enough market to \nmake local cocaine distribution in some neighborhoods very lucrative. \nMarijuana use is even more prevalent, with authorities saying that \nmarijuana sales account for a significant portion of the gangs\u2019 incomes, \nsecond to extortion.\nOne official with the Honduran Attorney General\u2019s office interviewed \nsuggested the gangs make greater profits from local control of drug \ndistribution networks and local extortion crimes than they do from organized criminal networks trafficking drugs through the country. \nTheir involvement with the transnational shipment of drugs is a profit \nboost for the gangs, but is far from their only source of income.\nThere is a problem of drug consumption within the gangs. While \ncocaine use is on the rise, the bigger issue appears to be sniffing glue, \npaint, and other inhalants along with marijuana use and the abuse of \nsome legal drugs. Officials also indicate they are seeing a rise of traffickers paid with product, something they say was once discouraged among the \ngangs and transportistas .\n35\nGangs are a serious problem in Honduran prisons. They continue \ntheir organization and recruitment within the prison system and maintain networks to facilitate access to cell phones, weapons, and \ndrugs for prisoners. They also corrupt or coerce the guards to permit \nthem to carry out various illegal activities, including the continued \ncoordination of criminal activities. Weapons, including high caliber \nrifles and explosives, have been trafficked into the prisons, according to \nlocal officials and media reports.James Bosworth| 72 |From South America to Honduras\nNearly all of the world\u2019s cocaine is produced in three countries in South \nAmerica: Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. The cocaine destined for the \nNorth American market must travel by boat or air to Central America and the Caribbean and onward to the United States.\n36 Approximately 90 \npercent of cocaine going to the United States travels through Central America and/or Mexico, though some analysts believe there has been a \nslight shift to the Caribbean route in the past year as Mexico has cracked \ndown on drug trafficking in its territory.\nFor much of the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, Colombian \norganizations played the largest foreign role in the management of \ncocaine at this point in the process. The cocaine transiting through Honduras was usually managed by Colombian organizations or by \ndomestic Honduran traffickers. The Colombian groups include the \nFuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia ( FARC), the Ej\u00e9rcito de \nLiberaci\u00f3n Nacional (ELN), the  Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC), \nthe Norte del Valle Cartel, and now, what are referred to as emerging \ncriminal bands ( bandas criminales, or BACRIM) formed in part by former \nparamilitaries.\n37\nMexican DTOs began strengthening and moving southward during \nthe early to mid-90s. Over the past decade a crackdown against the trafficking groups in Colombia has reduced their influence and allowed \nMexican cartels to stretch their influence all the way down to South \nAmerica. While the Mexican organizations have had ties in Honduras for \nat least 15 years, as described above, they have solidified their control of \nHonduran DTOs in the last 5 years. Through violence and competitive \nmarket forces, they have displaced Colombian organizations and pushed domestic Honduran organizations either out of business or to a second \ntier status working for Mexican DTOs.\nColombian groups\u2014particularly the FARC, the BACRIM, and \nvarious micro-cartels\u2014still play an important role in trafficking cocaine \nto Central America. Notably, the BACRIM group known as Los \nRastrojos managed a number of illicit plane routes from the Colombia-\nVenezuela border to Honduras during 2009.  Additionally, during  \n2009 and 2010 there was a rise of Venezuelan-based DTOs that have Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 73 |begun to replace the Colombian groups on some routes by air and sea \ngoing to Honduras.38\nBy Air\nIn 2005, the Honduran government recorded no illicit flights, though \ntheir ability to fully monitor that activity means that some flights may \nhave landed on Honduran territory.39  Based on the number of crash \nlandings and official seizures, the number of illicit flights increased \nenormously around 2008. In 2009, government statistics suggest that \nat least 154 flights landed, about 3 per week. That number may well \nbe higher, as government officials admit that they do not have full information about their own airspace.\nThe flights are generally operated by Colombian or Venezuelan \ntrafficking groups, though some local Central American transportista \ngroups have also been reported to operate the flights. Most of the pilots captured in the past two years are Colombian and Venezuelan. Illicit \nflights take off from South America, usually Venezuela or just across \nthe border in Colombia, and fly up to the Caribbean side of Central America.\n40  Some of the flights cross through Nicaraguan airspace.\nThere are hundreds of clandestine landing strips in eastern and northern \nHonduras, particularly in the Olancho and Atl\u00e1ntida provinces. There are reports that Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa Cartel has constructed landing areas.\n41 \n In some cases, landowners may be paid as much as $50,000 for the right to use a landing strip on their property for a single night.\n42 \n Other local officials interviewed indicate that some landowners receive little or no payment and are simply glad to escape unharmed.\n43 \nAdditionally, traffickers sometimes use highways in the region, paying off local police officials to look the other way as necessary.\nMany planes make a partial or total crash landing, with the intent \nof never taking off again. The trafficking organizations make enough \nmoney off the shipments that the planes can be considered disposable. \nThe government knows about many of the flights not due to enhanced \nradar or surveillance, but because the planes crash and wreckage is left \nbehind or because there are crash reports from eye witnesses.\n44 James Bosworth| 74 |A team of workers, usually Honduran but sometimes including a \nMexican manager, unloads the cocaine from the plane and generally \ndestroys and hides the plane if it is not already overly damaged from the \nlanding. The team of workers costs less than $10,000 dollars for a night\u2019s \nwork, including security and transportation.\nThe lack of airspace and ground control make the Honduran \nMosquitia, the eastern region along the Nicaraguan border that is mostly \nwithin the Gracias a Dios province, an easy region for the traffickers to fly over and perhaps a tempting target in which to land. One official \nnoted that the government lacks the technological capabilities to know \nhow many illicit flights are coming in.\n45 However, the near complete \nlack of infrastructure in that region pushes away even the traffickers, \nwho have a hard time moving the cocaine out of that area once they land \nit there. Instead, most traffickers aim for Olancho or Atl\u00e1ntida.\nThere is an alternative air route that moves through Honduras\u2019s \nmajor domestic and international airports. In these cases, officials at the \nairports are bribed so that the planes can clear inspection and customs. \nOfficials indicate this is a popular method to traffic bulk amounts of cash rather than cocaine, but instances of drug traffickers landing and taking \noff from Honduras\u2019 airports in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula have \noccurred.\n46\nFew drug shipments leave Honduras by air heading north for any \nsignificant distance. Local media suggest the Sinaloa organization may \nhave light planes and even helicopters flying short distances over the \nborder from northern Honduras to southern Guatemala.47\nHowever, Honduran officials indicate it would be difficult for a plane \nto make it across their airspace from east to west without being detected. \nFlights may also head north from Honduras over the ocean and then \nturn west to cross over Belize into Guatemala or directly into Mexico. \nHowever, authorities believe the examples they have seen along those \nlines are more of a rarity than the norm for traffickers, who prefer to \nmove drugs by land or sea once they are inside Honduras.Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 75 |By Sea\nA majority of the cocaine moving through Honduras arrives by sea and \nnearly all of it via the Caribbean coast.48 As Honduras\u2019s Pacific coast is \nvery small and only has one major port, the percentage coming via the \nPacific route is lower than that of its neighbors. Some cocaine arrives via the Pacific to Costa Rica, \nNicaragua, or El Salvador and then crosses a land border to Honduras.\nCocaine can move its way up \nthe Caribbean coast to Honduras \nby boat, either quickly or hidden. \nGo-fast boats move the cocaine with \nspeed. They often hug the coastline \nand refuel at key gray market points. Technology has given them greater \nability to run further out from the \ncoast and identify refueling points \nwith greater precision.\nSome cocaine also moves via \nslower \u201cfishing\u201d vessels and travels \nthrough the same routes and ports as local fishermen. There are cases \nof outside traffickers coming in \nand \u201crenting\u201d fishing vessels from \ntheir owners as well as owners who \nwork on contract for a trafficking \norganization for one to two days \nevery few months to supplement their income. \nWhen cocaine is seized at or near \nsea, the teams moving the cocaine are \ngenerally Colombian, Nicaraguan \nor Honduran. According to officials, \nthe heavy Colombian presence \namong those arrested suggests that Colombian organizations maintain fuel smuggling and logistics\nA related industry in fuel purchasing, \ntrafficking and storage has increased alongside the illicit drug trafficking industry. While not generally illegal to purchase or move most types of fuel within Honduras, authorities are on the lookout for purchases that appear to be going towards fueling go-fasts refueling along the Caribbean coastline or airplanes refueling from illicit landing strips.\nA secondary network of gray market \noperatives working for organized crime will leave fuel and other supplies near airstrips and tag the specific GPS coordinates. At sea, the logistics network will place several containers of fuel in the water with a small buoy and mark the coordinates. These coordinates are then sent by phone, SMS,  \nor email to the traffickers. The go-fast captains will have a list of potential fuel locations as they travel up the coast.  Many recent arrests have included a GPS device among the seized items from the traffickers.\nInterview with U.S. counter-narcotics official, \nAugust 2010.James Bosworth| 76 |control over these routes for the time being.49 Colombians often serve \nas the enforcers, making sure the other traffickers on the vessel remain \non task.\nSemi-submersibles have also been used along the Caribbean coast of \nHonduras, with fishing vessels at times towing underwater vessels laden \nwith cocaine. The U.S. government has attempted to help countries in \nthe region identify and track these vessels, but local officials believe that \na number of these vessels are still getting through Honduran waters.\nBy land\nCocaine enters Honduras by land through El Salvador and Nicaraguan border crossings along the western edge of Nicaragua\u2019s border. Cocaine \nis also trafficked by land over the eastern part of the Nicaragua-Honduras \nborder, but even the DTOs are limited by the lack of infrastructure that \nmakes trafficking by land more difficult than by sea or air in that area. \nRoads are unpaved and poorly maintained. Fuel, food, and basic supplies \nare limited and must be brought into the region.\nAuthorities and analysts disagreed over whether land trafficking is \nincreasing as a preferred means of transport. Analysts who track the issue report a significant increase in reports of large seizures that were \ntrafficked by land from Nicaragua and through Honduras. However, \nauthorities in Honduras said their statistics, while not perfect, do not \nindicate an increase in land trafficking.\n50\nSeveral organizations run vehicles up the Pan-American highway \nfrom Panama or Costa Rica to northern Guatemala, as a recent arrest \nof members of the Gulf Cartel highlighted. They often pass through \nHonduras, stopping only at border checkpoints and gas stations and \nperhaps spending a night near San Pedro Sula before attempting the \nborder crossing in the morning. \nLocal media who have followed the issue claim that the cartels pay \ndrivers $200-$500 plus the cost of gas to run a shipment of 20-100 kilos up the highway in a car.\n51  In many Central American countries for \npoorer sectors of the population, that amounts to about a month\u2019s wage Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 77 |for a job that takes three to four days. The cost of getting caught can be \nseveral years in prison for Hondurans or deportation for non-Hondurans.\nThere are also indications that larger-scale land trafficking may be \noccurring in western Honduras. In mid-August, a dump truck with \n500 kilos of cocaine was seized.  As one expert in illicit trafficking stated, \u201cAs they [the DTOs] see success with small scale trafficking, they \nattempt larger and larger shipments to test their luck\u2026 A bust of that size \nsuggests many smaller shipments made it through first.\u201d \nHonduras has seen an increase in traffickers from Africa and East Asia. \nThese are generally people who are being illicitly trafficked as humans \nand who also serve as mules\u2014sometimes voluntarily and sometimes \nforced\u2014to pay their way. The increase in trafficking of and by foreigners \ncreates a problem for the Honduran justice system, which would deport \nthese individuals but does not have the resources to do so. Some of them \nlanguish in a kind of legal limbo in a Honduran jail for immigrants as \nthey are not a high priority for the Honduran government.\nOther Illegal Activity Linked to Organized Crime\nWhile the bulk of organized criminal money in Honduras is made from \ndrug trafficking and extortion, a number of other illicit services occur \nas well. Some of these, like money laundering, are directly linked to the \ndrug trafficking operations. Others, like the trafficking in exotic animals \nor contraband, is tangentially linked, often using the related networks to \nsmuggle items across borders.\nHonduras has a money laundering task force, but according to local \nauthorities money laundering is less of an issue in Honduras than in some of its neighbors. The bigger issue concerns the large amounts of bulk \nU.S. cash smuggled through the country. As exchanging a large amount \nof U.S. dollars into Honduran currency (lempiras) is not particularly \neasy, most criminals and their related networks functioning in the gray \nand legal market prefer to work in U.S. dollars in Honduras. With \nlimited government capacity to investigate financial crimes, criminals \ndo not always feel the need to launder the money. In a country in which many crimes are never investigated or prosecuted, criminals who decide James Bosworth| 78 |to keep their profits in Honduras can spend \u2018dirty\u2019 money with impunity \nwithout going through the time, effort, and cost of laundering the \nmoney.52\nBulk cash smuggling is largely done over land routes or by air, \noften on legal flights from major airports. For example, in early October 2010, the Honduran police arrested four Colombian citizens \nattempting to traffic nearly US$1.5 million from the San Pedro Sula \nairport. Another two Colombians were arrested with $20,000.\n53 \n Another arrest in Guatemala in late 2010 suggested mules were being \npaid $400 to traffic money in their cars from Guatemala to Panama.54 \nMany would then return north and pick up cocaine in Nicaragua to \ntraffic back to Guatemala.\nWhile most transactions occur in cash, there have also been some \ndrugs for arms deals in Honduras, according to media reports. Honduran \nauthorities believe there was a spike in arms trafficking into the country \nin early 2009.55  They also believe that the Zetas moved high caliber \nfirearms, most stolen from security units in Mexico and Guatemala, into the Atl\u00e1ntida and Col\u00f3n provinces in exchange for cocaine.\n56\nIn one particularly high profile case, Syrian arms trafficker Tahal \nHassam Kanthous, also known as Jamal Yousef, was arrested in Honduras and indicted in New York on charges of plotting to sell 100 M-16 assault \nrifles, 100 AR-15 rifles, 2,500 hand grenades, C-4 explosives, and \nantitank munitions to the FARC in exchange for a ton of cocaine.\n57 \nHowever, cases like this are the exception and do not appear to be the \ngeneral trend in Honduras.\nOther cases involve the flow of arms trafficking northward, with \nweapons from the 1980s conflicts in Nicaragua and El Salvador making \ntheir way to Mexico through Honduras.58 Honduran authorities report \nthat firearms including grenade-launchers have been lost or stolen from Honduran military bases and found in Mexico and Colombia.\n59\nIn recent years, illicit human trafficking has been tied to the illegal \ndrug trade in Honduras through the Zetas. Human trafficking is a major issue in Honduras, as the nation provides points of transit and departure. \nMexico deported 23,000 Hondurans in 2009 and is on pace to deport \nnearly the same number in 2010. Meanwhile, the Mexican Institute of \nMigration estimates that 400,000 people cross illegally into Mexico each Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 79 |year and many of them are from points south of Honduras, suggesting \nthey pass through Honduras at some point on their way to Mexico.60\nAnimal trafficking occurs from Honduras\u2019 native forests or through \nHonduras from Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua but does not appear \nto be managed by a large or centralized organization. Birds, monkeys, \nand snakes are all frequently and illegally trafficked, usually to markets in \nthe United States. Similarly, hardwoods from Honduras and Nicaragua \nare trafficked illegally to Mexico, the United States, and Europe, often \nthrough the corruption of customs officials. The criminals committing \nthis type of trafficking are usually different than those trafficking in illicit drugs. However, it is worth noting that in the 1980s and 90s, the non-\ndrug smugglers became some of the key regional transportistas for drugs.\n61\nThe Effects\nThe security situation in Honduras has deteriorated significantly over \nthe past five years. The number of murders has increased nationwide and \n3,1763,488 3,629\n2,224 2,1552,4173,0183,2624,4735,265\n2,929\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010*Total violent deaths: 36,036Violent Deaths Per Year\n(2000-June 2010)\nGraphic of murder statistics in Honduras from Comisionado Nacional de los \nDerechos Humanos (CONADEH) report to Congress,62 October 2010. \nSource: Years 2000 - 2004, National Police \n2005 - June 2010, Violence ObservatoryJames Bosworth| 80 |many of these murders can be linked directly back to drug trafficking \norganizations. \nThe influence of organized crime is evident in many locations, but \nno criminal organization \u201ccontrols\u201d large swaths of territory. Mexican \nDTOs have varying degrees of prevalence across the country, but there \nare few areas where analysts can clearly say, \u201cthis is Sinaloa territory\u201d or \n\u201cthis is Zeta territory\u201d in the way that areas of Mexico or Guatemala \ncan be identified and mapped. Rather, there is a significant amount of overlap among the Mexican groups. There are indications that some \ngangs ( maras ) exercise significant control over neighborhoods ( colonias ) \nof the capital and San Pedro Sula, but these are more local phenomenon than transnational crime.\n63\nImpunity for crimes remains a problem. According to the Honduran \nNational Commission on Human Rights, between 2005 and 2009 there were nearly 50,000 denunciations of human rights violations. Of those, \nthere were 12,098 arrest warrants and only 2,510 arrests from those \norders.\nCorruption within the Honduran political and security system is \nwidespread due to the influence of organized crime. Drug trafficking \norganizations are willing to pay a month\u2019s wages to a police officer or solider for one or two nights worth of work. Current and former police \nofficers have been recruited to provide security. The corruption also \ncreates a level of distrust within the institutions of government. Civilian \nand military organizations are more reluctant to share information \noutside their organization when they believe that it may be leaked to the \ncriminals.\nPoliticians have also been linked with organized crime. For example, \nin 2003, a member of the Honduran Congress, Armando \u00c1vila Pancham\u00e9 \nof the Nationalist Party, was sentenced to 20 years in prison after being \ncaught operating with a Colombian group bringing cocaine into the \ncountry.\n64 There is also strong evidence that at least one local mayor near \nthe Guatemalan border, Alexander Ardon of the town of El Paraiso, has been corrupted by the Sinaloa Cartel.\n65  Authorities suspect the number \nof mayors who receive a plato o plomo , (silver or lead), style threat from \nthe cartels is growing.66Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 81 |By 2010, Honduras had become one of the most dangerous \ncountries in the world for journalists. The situation is a combination \nof the effects of organized crime, the effects of the coup, and the \ngovernment\u2019s unwillingness to take the investigation of crimes seriously, \noften dismissing the organized crime-related killings as street crimes \nbefore a full investigation can be completed. An investigation by the \nCommittee to Protect Journalists found, \u201cThe government\u2019s ongoing \nfailure to successfully investigate crimes against journalists and other social critics\u2014whether by intention, impotence, or incompetence\u2014has \ncreated a climate of pervasive impunity.\u201d\n67\nThe indigenous tribes along the Atlantic coast of southeastern Honduras \nand northeastern Nicaragua are being heavily affected by drug trafficking in their region. The drug business pays more than any job or potential job. \nRoberto Orozco, an investigator with the Institute for Strategic Studies \nand Public Policy (IEEPP), a Nicaraguan think tank, said organized \ncrime\u2019s biggest weapon is \u201c[its] ability to pay in cash for services.\u201d\n68 \n The money is seen as a boost to the communities. In addition, communities long ignored and marginalized by the national governments \nreceive social services that they were never able to get before:  criminals \nhave been known to invest in health, schools, and other services that the \ngovernment has failed to provide.\nSeveral analysts interviewed indicated that communities on the \nCaribbean coast of Honduras and Nicaragua were working to make their \ncommunities hospitable to traffickers, in some ways competing with each other to be the most desirable destination. Communities are avoiding \ncooperation with authorities, as they are concerned that cooperation \nwill lead to traffickers using other communities and diverting a lucrative \nsource of income.\nThere is also the issue of \u201cfishing,\u201d in which these communities collect \npackages of cocaine that have been dropped by the cartels from go-fasts \nthat were being pursued by the authorities or accidentally sunk. In many cases, these packages of cocaine can be resold to the cartels operating in \nthe region, providing a source of income for the communities.\n69\nWhile the issue of human rights is generally discussed in the context \nof government actions or obligations, it\u2019s worth noting that the criminal organizations in Honduras are a key violator of human rights in the \ncountry, depriving citizens of their right to life and security and James Bosworth| 82 |indirectly violating their rights to fair and impartial institutions of justice \nby undermining the government institutions that do investigative and \njudicial work.\nEfforts to Combat Crime\nThe Honduran Congress in July 2003 passed a tough anti-gang \nlaw (commonly referred to as Mano Dura ) that made membership in \ncertain gangs illegal and increased sentences for those convicted of gang activity. The law extended police powers to detain gang members and \nprovided a brief surge of security as gang members were rounded up and thrown in prison. However, the law proved ineffective and perhaps even \ncounterproductive as some gang members were released due to lack of \nevidence while others used the weak prison institutions to recruit and \norganize the gangs into even stronger forces.\n70\nThe 2006 presidential election in Honduras pitted Manuel Zelaya \nagainst Porfiorio Lobo. Faced with key issues of crime and security, Lobo promised a major crackdown on gangs and organized crime, \nindicating he would go further than even the administration of then President Ricardo Maduro. Zelaya, on the other hand, offered a softer \napproach, arguing that the Mano Dura  anti-gang policies of the Maduro \nadministration had failed. Zelaya narrowly won the election.\n71\nCrime increased in the first year of the Zelaya administration and the \nMexican cartels began increasing their reach in the country during that time. Zelaya\u2019s opponents like to blame the president for these facts and \nit appears true the Zelaya administration did little to focus on anti-gang \nor anti-crime measures. He met with his military, police, and security \nadvisors far less often than the Maduro administration did. His plans to \ntry a softer approach with the gangs never really came to fruition. With \na focus on the economy and political issues, security was simply not on the president\u2019s agenda on a daily basis.\n72\nHowever, it is impossible to know the counter-factual of how a \nhypothetical President Lobo in 2006 or 2007 would have responded to \norganized crime. With the crackdowns on DTOs in Colombia and then \nMexico under President Felipe Calder\u00f3n, and the general expansion of Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 83 |Mexican DTOs throughout the hemisphere, it may be that the expansion \nof organized criminal groups and the increase in related violence in \nHonduras was inevitable. It is also a common and fair criticism to say \nMaduro\u2019s anti-gang policies were not built for long term success and \nthe conditions in prisons overcrowded from gang arrests may have \naggravated the problem as Zelaya\u2019s term in office continued.\nFor a time in 2008, the Zelaya administration ceased its softer \napproach and returned to more traditional anti-crime operations, sending additional police into the streets and even using the military \nin some operations. However, effectiveness was limited and Honduras\u2019 \nmurder and crime rates continued to rise.\n73\nGang activity increased and became more violent in 2008 and 2009, \nand transnational criminal organizations increased their influence in the \ncountry. The Sinaloa Cartel, in particular, expanded operations in the \nnorthern areas while the Zetas and Gulf Cartel expanded in competition \nfor territory. The numbers of illicit flights jumped and the amount of \ncocaine trafficked through the country by land, sea, and air all increased, \naccording to Honduran and U.S. government figures.74 The number of \nmurders in the country also remained among the highest levels in the hemisphere, though they would get even worse post-coup.\nAs the Zelaya administration continued, the focus on various political \nfronts including the push for a constitutional reform in 2009 further \nremoved security issues from the president\u2019s agenda. This paper makes \nno judgments on the proposed constitutional reform other than to say \nthat the focus on the political issues meant less focus on security issues. \nZelaya\u2019s inattention to the security issue and the increasing role of \norganized crime in the country during his term would lead to accusations after he was removed that his government had tacit agreements with the \nFARC or Sinaloa Cartel to traffic cocaine and that his government was \nusing cocaine profits to fund political activities. None of those rumors \nwas ever confirmed with public evidence. The security concerns and \nlevels of corruption appear to be caused more by neglect than by any sort of clandestine agreement at the highest levels.James Bosworth| 84 |The Coup\nSeparate from the issue of organized crime, President Zelaya took \neconomic and political measures in 2008 and 2009 that angered many \nof the traditional power brokers in Honduras, including those in the president\u2019s own party. He pushed for a constituyente or constitutional \nreferendum to rewrite Honduras\u2019 constitution. Zelaya claimed he was \nrewriting an outdated document to improve the democratic institutions of \nHonduras and make them work for the people. Zelaya\u2019s opponents said the \npresident was actually undermining democracy and attempting to change \nthe constitution in order to remain in power longer and allow reelection.\nThe situation deteriorated in June 2009 as Zelaya, after being blocked \nfrom holding a referendum to rewrite the constitution, attempted to hold \na non-binding vote on the matter and ordered the military to assist with the non-binding poll.\n75  The legislative and judicial branches disagreed \nwith Zelaya and said he had no right to hold the poll or order the military \nto be involved. On the morning of June 28, 2009, the day of the non-\nbinding referendum, the military showed up at the presidential palace \nand placed President Zelaya onto a plane to Costa Rica, forcing him into \nexile. Members of the legislative and judicial branches attempted post-\nhoc to justify the military\u2019s actions as part of a judicial order they later \nproduced. However, Zelaya\u2019s supporters and every government in the hemisphere condemned the action as a coup.\nThe same day Zelaya was forced into exile, the Honduran \nCongress named congressional leader Roberto Micheletti as de-facto \npresident of Honduras until elections could be held later that year.\n76 \n Every country in the hemisphere condemned the coup, and Honduras \nwas removed by a unanimous vote from the OAS under the rules of \nthe democratic charter. Many countries cut off political, military, and \neconomic ties as well. \nOrganized crime did not directly cause the coup. The criminal \norganizations did not have a favorite in the coup, though both the pro- \nand anti-Zelaya forces tried to claim the other had significant ties to \norganized crime and drug trafficking. Rather, the main reasons the military unconstitutionally overthrew President Zelaya were political.\nHowever, an argument can be made that the organized crime \nsituation in Honduras did play a secondary role in destabilizing the Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 85 |Zelaya government. By corrupting local government officials and \nundermining the professionalism of the Honduran military, it weakened \nthe institutions of government. Organized crime also benefitted greatly \nfrom the turmoil caused by the coup.\nIf the fight against organized crime was minimized under Zelaya, it \nwas completely ignored under Micheletti. Honduras was in a complete \npolitical crisis, with protests and counter-protests and with a full \ntime focus on legitimizing the government and maintaining stability. Counterdrug chief Julian Ar\u00edstides told Reuters at the time that the \nMicheletti government didn\u2019t even have a strategy to fight organized \ncrime.\n77\nThe number of illicit flights with cocaine entering Honduran airspace, \nalready quite high under the Zelaya administration, skyrocketed once \nMicheletti was named interim president.78 One official reported that \nunder the interim government more planes were landing carefully on runways and taking off again to make second and third trips into the \ncountry.\n79  DTOs were so certain that they would not be caught by \nHonduran authorities that rather than simply abandoning their airplanes, \nit became economically viable to reuse them.80\nThe Honduran government said several illicit planes per week were  \nlanding with cocaine supplies, and some authorities suggested but could not prove that numbers of flights landing averaged as many as one to \ntwo per day.\n81 The Micheletti government, eager to turn the issue from \na political liability to a political advantage, accused Zelaya of links to \ndrug trafficking and threatened to file a formal international complaint \nagainst the Venezuelan government, whom it accused of sending the \ncocaine, or at least turning a blind eye to the flights, as part of a plot to \ndestabilize the government.\nDomestic resources to prevent or investigate crimes were diverted \nto guard the border against Zelaya\u2019s return and to a certain extent repress protesters that had taken over parts of the capital and other areas \nof the country. Even as this occurred, officials within the Micheletti \ngovernment complained, with some accuracy, that President Zelaya had \ndiverted the military and police from their key security tasks to perform \nhis political goals. However, Micheletti was using the military for \ndomestic political tasks too, including using the public forces to control James Bosworth| 86 |political protests in Tegucigalpa and sending them to border areas to \nprevent the unauthorized reentry of Zelaya or his supporters.\nInternational isolation due to the coup was intended to place political \nand economic pressure on the interim government, but it also cut \nresources for the fight against organized crime and gave the transnational \ncriminal organizations free reign to operate. Investigators within the \nFiscalia could not contact counterparts to share information about cases. \nThe Honduran government claimed they were restricted from speaking with the Mexican government about the possible movements of \u201cEl \nChapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n through their territory.\n82\nUnder Micheletti, the numbers of murders and kidnappings increased \naccording to official statistics and very few crimes were solved. Some of the violence was clearly political while other violence likely caused by \norganized crime was spun by the two political factions as proof of the \nother\u2019s corruption.\n83\n In 2009, the United States cut off $32.7 million in assistance to \nHonduras, including $11 million in security assistance due to the coup.84 \nThe U.S. military, which maintains about 600 military personnel at the \nSoto Cano Air Force Base, cut off joint military activities and some \nmilitary assistance. However, U.S. troops maintained their presence at \nthe base and continued limited contact with the Honduran military \nin order to continue operations. Their mission focused mostly on \nhumanitarian relief, including delivering aid to regions of El Salvador \nthat were hit by flooding. The United States cancelled the planned use \nof Soto Cano for the Panamax 2009 military exercises, which led to the Hondurans withdrawing from the event.\n85\nThe cutoff of U.S. assistance combined with significant budget \nproblems overall left Honduras with very limited resources to combat \ndrug trafficking. The Micheletti government had large scale budget \nproblems throughout its six months in power.\nInformation sharing about the movement of drug traffickers between \nHonduras and its neighbors as well as between Honduras and the United \nStates was reduced. Officials commenting from both the United States \nand Honduras sides differed as to whether information sharing, such as information on drug flight tracks and suspicious vessels at sea, was \ncompletely cut off or if information about illicit flights and boats was \nstill being shared. It appears that there was some backchannel sharing of Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 87 |information that did not run through the formal channels that were cut \noff by the events in June 2009.86\nU.S. officials may have tipped off counterparts within the Honduran \nmilitary or counternarcotics police about certain shipments by sea or air, \nbut this was done unofficially and was not systematic. Similarly, there \nare indications that informal military to military and police to police \ncontacts continued, mostly via telephone or unofficial personal emails.\nCooperation and information sharing between Honduran authorities \nand their counterparts in neighboring countries were also significantly \nreduced. Officials from the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Colombia who had been collaborating with their \nHonduran counterparts on investigations into organized crime were \nofficially cut off from those communications by their governments. \nInvestigations that required officials from both countries were halted, \nand time and momentum was lost.\n87\nPost-Coup\nIn November 2009, elections were held and Porfirio \u201cPepe\u201d Lobo won the presidency against Liberal Party candidate Elvin Santos. The elections \nwere boycotted by supporters of President Zelaya. Lobo was inaugurated \nin January 2010. Over the course of the year, many countries, including \nthe United States, recognized the legitimacy of Lobo\u2019s government. \nHowever, several key countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, \nand Nicaragua, have not granted diplomatic recognition and continue to \nblock the reincorporation of Honduras into the OAS.\nEven as the domestic and international effects of the coup seem to \ndominate the issues that Lobo faces, it is worth remembering this is the same person who, as a candidate in 2006, ran on a security platform and \narguably lost because he focused too hard on that issue to the detriment \nof others. Security is a priority of the administration.\nIn the words of one top Lobo administration official, \u201csecurity is \nback on the agenda.\u201d The president meets at least once a week with key security officials and closely follows developments on fighting organized \ncrime and gangs.\n88James Bosworth| 88 |democracy vs. security\nThe spike in crime in Honduras caused by transnational criminal organizations \nduring the coup should be cause for reflection in the international community. \nThe diplomatic and financial isolation of the de facto government provided criminal organizations an opportunity to expand their operations with few \nconcerns about repercussions. \nThe recommendations of nearly every report on drug trafficking and organized \ncrime in the hemisphere cite the need for more cooperation, information \nsharing, and the development of a comprehensive strategy. Yet, the values \nof democracy promotion suggest that regimes that violate basic democratic \nnorms should be isolated. Those two issues conflicted with one another in \nHonduras and the transnational criminal organizations benefited.\nIndeed, if toppled democracies lead to weaker cooperation against organized \ncrime, then criminal groups have a perverse incentive to adopt a strategy that \ndestabilizes democratic governments.\nIsolating anti-democratic governments may place pressure on those regimes; \nbut such pressure comes with a set of second-order consequences that may \nor may not create more harm than good.  One of the lessons of Honduras is \nthat the isolation of a government in the hemisphere, even if done with good \nintentions, creates an opening for organized crime to operate with relative \nimpunity.\nIn the case of Honduras, the hemisphere should have considered continuing \ninformation sharing about drug trafficking routes and movements, even with \ndiplomatic ties reduced. A more targeted set of sanctions that still provided \nlimited civilian assistance for police and investigative capabilities may have \nalso helped. The challenge is that those types of recommendations require \nnuance in a regional political environment that is highly polarized.\nThe best remedy is to prevent democratic governments from failing so that \nthe hemisphere doesn\u2019t face that choice. However, when disruptions of \ndemocracy do occur, the hemisphere needs to find ways to condemn and pressure the undemocratic behavior without also hurting the hemispheric fight \nagainst organized crime.Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 89 |The Minister of Security, \u00d3scar \u00c1lvarez, served with the same \npost under President Maduro and has become a very public figure on \norganized crime issues.\nThe international media has focused on questions of truth and \nreconciliation in Honduras after the coup, questions of international \nrecognition of the Honduran government, and the ongoing resistance \nby opposition forces. These forces continue to oppose the legitimacy of \nPresident Lobo and call for a constitutional assembly process, for which they claim to have gathered 1.3 million signatures. \nThe Lobo government has refocused security forces on fighting \norganized crime, sending troops to carry out public security functions, \npushing laws through Congress to facilitate the fight against crime, and \nregaining relations with the United States and regional neighbors. It \nseeks to receive security aid and improve cooperation and information \nsharing. The Lobo government sent hundreds of additional police officers into various neighborhoods of the capital.\n89 According to interviews \nwith police in the capital, the government\u2019s initial statistics, scheduled \nto be released in early 2011, indicate some early success with security in \nthe capital, but interviews with local police indicate that gangs still have \nconsiderable control in certain neighborhoods.90\nDespite these initiatives and hints of success in southern Honduras, \nthe results in northern Honduras have not been so good. The murder \nrate in Honduras remains among the highest in the world, corruption is \nhigh, and serious human rights violations abound. Furthermore, some \nof the government\u2019s opponents worry that the government uses the fight \nagainst organized crime as a way to repress its political opposition.\nIn April 2010, President Lobo announced an emergency decree \nto use the military for domestic security tasks. He began by ordering 2,000 soldiers along the Atlantic coast to participate in drugs and arms \ninterdiction. The military has the authority to search for criminals and \nuse some of their intelligence and investigative capabilities to follow up \non crimes. The Honduran Congress also passed an initiative supported \nby the president in June 2010 that allows the military a greater role in \nassisting police in domestic security operations to combat organized \ncrime and gangs.James Bosworth| 90 |Lobo\u2019s opponents saw these actions differently \u2013 as a way to repress \na landless campesinos movement in Bajo Agu\u00e1n. During the Lobo \ngovernment, the Movimiento de Campesinos del Valle del Agu\u00e1n (MUCA), \nmade up of about 3,000 families, has demanded its constitutional right to \nland in the region. Newspaper pundits sympathetic with the government \ninsinuated that the group was either \ntrying to spark a revolution or was linked to DTOs. Government officials \nhave also expressed concerns about \nan armed group forming in the area. \nThe Inter-American Commission \non Human Rights said it was very \ntroubled by allegations that the military \nhad committed abuses in the region, and human rights groups denounced \ninsinuations that landless groups were \nviolent.\n91\nBeyond the human rights concerns \ncommon in Latin America where \nmilitary have been tasked with \nfunctions usually reserved for civilian \npolice92, the recent coup in Honduras \nraises additional red flags for local civil society groups who are concerned that \nmilitary operations against organized \ncrime are at times targeting the \npolitical opposition or resistance. \nVarious human rights issues \nremaining from the coup create additional problems for the prosecution \nof organized crime today. A judge who \ndisagreed with a Supreme Court ruling \nattempting to legitimize the removal of \nPresident Zelaya was removed from his \nposition under the Lobo administration; the firing of the judge raised concerns that the government was politicizing the judicial system. the Budget Question\nPlaying a role within the ability of \nthe Honduran state to counter drug traffickers is a structural budget crisis that has no easy solution. Blame is widely spread for the crisis, but some basic facts are indisputable. The government can barely pay its most basic costs (government salaries, pensions, necessary services) and has no money for any additional investment, purchases, or expansions.  The cutoff of aid following the coup contributed to this budget crisis and affected every aspect of Honduran government spending including the fight against organized crime.\nOne Honduran official told the author, \n\u201cIt\u2019s our very limited resources versus the virtually unlimited resources of the narcotraffickers.\u201d Another official, talking about the period under the Micheletti government, said, \u201cWe were alone in our fight against the criminals. We did the best we could with no outside funds.\u201dHonduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 91 |While the issue is more related to the debate over democracy, it has \nconsequences for the effectiveness of the judicial system, which is vital to \nthe prosecution of organized crime.\nThe Lobo government has taken some steps to address human rights \nconcerns. The Attorney General\u2019s office has an investigative unit tasked \nto work on human rights and the National Commission on Human \nRights (CONADEH) investigates and denounces abuses.93 However, \nlocal human rights groups suggest that these steps are far from effective. Various local groups are critical of the head of CONADEH, Ram\u00f3n \nCustodio, for his role during the Micheletti government, which created \na perception that the unit is not politically impartial. Additionally, the \nLobo government has been publicly dismissive of human rights concerns \nby NGOs, refusing to acknowledge ongoing problems. Too often, \ngovernment officials suggest that victims of crimes have been involved with DTOs or maras  before full investigations are completed, which \nlikely harms the ability to investigate organized crime and end impunity.\nAmong other measures, the Honduran Congress passed a new asset \nforfeiture law in June 2010 that both U.S. and Honduran authorities say assists in clearing up the bureaucratic bottlenecks over what to \ndo with items seized from the traffickers. The law does not sort out \nall the bureaucratic difficulties regarding who receives financial or political credit for seizures or who can use or sell the items seized.\n94 \nStill, Honduran authorities feel it holds promise for resolving problems \nthat plagued previous administrations. Recent investigations suggest that \nmoney seized as evidence was later stolen from the government, likely \nby corrupt officials.95\nCooperation within the Honduran bureaucracy is absolutely necessary, \naccording to both Honduran and U.S. officials interviewed. While Honduran officials were very positive about their ability to cooperate \nwith each other, U.S. and independent analysts held more pessimistic \nviews. The police, counter-drug investigators, and Attorney General \nlack the equipment and mobility necessary to combat organized crime. \nThis makes the military\u2019s cooperation vital for civilian efforts, as it has \nthe equipment that civilian agencies, including local police departments, lack. However, this also raises questions as to the over-militarization of \nlaw enforcement issues.James Bosworth| 92 |Several civilian government officials interviewed had particular praise \nfor the Honduran Navy for their assistance in transporting and providing \nsecurity for police and Fiscal\u00eda investigators. They said the Navy\u2019s base \nin the Mosquitia region is the only permanent government presence and \nhas an impact in deterring trafficking by both sea and air in that area.96 \nThe Navy captures go-fast boats at sea and on rivers. It also participates in the destruction of clandestine runways in the region.\nRegional Cooperation\nRegionally, the government of Honduras is increasingly working with \nthe governments of Guatemala and El Salvador to coordinate counter-\ndrug and counter-gang efforts. Information sharing has resumed to \npre-coup levels. The countries have also discussed coordinating their \nanti-gang legislation to parallel El Salvador\u2019s recently passed bill that \ncriminalizes gang membership and increases punishment for gang \nactivity.97 The attorneys general in each country also want to unify \ninvestigations to avoid situations in which gang members commit crimes in one country and flee to another.\nIn mid-2010, President Mauricio Funes of El Salvador called an \nemergency meeting of the Central American Integration System (SICA) \nto address the issue of organized crime. The move by El Salvador came \nafter a bus burning by gangs in El Salvador killed over a dozen passengers, \nan act that Funes called \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n98 President Laura Chinchilla of \nCosta Rica has also been vocal in asking the United States to create \nand fund a separate Central American counter-drug strategy. However, \nit\u2019s worth noting that efforts to coordinate counter-gang efforts have \nbeen on the table in Central America for several years and have had \nlimited effect.  For example, a meeting between SICA members and the \nUnited States in July 2007 produced a similar set of recommendations \nand agreements about combating organized crime, drug trafficking, and illicit arms smuggling.\nPresident Lobo attended the 2010 meeting as Honduras was \nreincorporated into SICA at the same event.\n99 While it was not stated \npublicly, it appears coordination on fighting organized crime was an \nimportant reason for the Guatemalan and Salvadoran governments, both Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 93 |of which are politically center-left, to recognize and reestablish relations \nwith the center-right government of President Lobo. \nHonduras is also working with the Colombian government to create \na joint action plan to combat organized crime.100 Officials suggest that \nColombia and the United States in combination with SICA are working \nto create a multilateral group to coordinate the fight against organized \ncrime and drug trafficking.\nPerhaps the most promising and most politically controversial idea \nfor combating organized crime is to create an internationally-backed \noutside investigative unit that could function as a Honduran version \nof the UN-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). The CICIG has been tasked to go after corruption \nand organized crime that has penetrated government institutions, by \nbringing in outside investigative capabilities to collect evidence that can \nbe presented at trial. The unit has shown limited successes, but a unit \nlike this in Honduras could bring much needed investigative capability \nto solve the nation\u2019s crimes.\nHowever, the idea faces significant political opposition. There are \nsovereignty concerns, questions of constitutionality, and bureaucratic issues. Government investigators in the police and attorney general\u2019s \noffices would almost certainly prefer greater resources for their own \nwork than money spent on a parallel (and in their view, redundant) \ninvestigative structure. Additionally, political opposition to the idea, \nprimarily from coup supporters, threatens to derail any attempt to create \na CICIG-like body in Honduras.\nThe head of the CICIG, Francisco Dall\u2019Anese, has suggested that he \nis open to the idea of installing a similar organization in Honduras or El Salvador.\n101 However, he notes that the Guatemala situation is relatively \nunique and what works in Guatemala may not work in other countries. \nIn particular, Dall\u2019Anese said an organization in Honduras would not be \npossible as government officials are unwilling to permit the organization \nenough independence and authority to manage the investigations. He \nalso noted that the CICIG can only be a temporary measure and that the \ndomestic judicial institutions must eventually be restructured. Current \ncriticisms of the CICIG from Guatemala\u2019s political establishment may also make Guatemala\u2019s neighbors hesitant to follow the model.James Bosworth| 94 |U.S. Assistance to Honduras\nThrough the Merida Initiative, the United States provided funds \nfor security programs in Honduras. Over the course of 2010, the U.S. \ngovernment is transitioning its support to a program called the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI).\n102\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service:103 \nFor FY2011, the Obama Administration requested nearly $68 million in foreign aid for Honduras, including almost $54 million \nin Development Assistance (DA), $12 million in Global Health and \nChild Survival assistance (GHCS), and $1.3 million in Foreign \nMilitary Financing (FMF). U.S. assistance in FY2011 will support \na variety of projects designed to enhance security, strengthen \ndemocracy, improve education and health systems, conserve the environment, and build trade capacity. Most assistance to the country \nis managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development \n(USAID) and the State Department.\nAs mentioned above, the cutoff of aid in 2009 affected $11 million in \nsecurity aid. Even with the resumption of relations and aid to Honduras, \ngetting the funds flowing again is not particularly smooth. Units that had \nbeen vetted for human rights abuses and corruption prior to the coup must be reviewed again, and contacts among agencies must be resumed. \nOfficials in both the U.S. and Honduran governments expressed \nfrustration at \u201cbottlenecks\u201d in the aid process, but both indicated that \nthey are working to resolve the issue.\n104\nThere is significant concern in the United States that intelligence \ngoing to security forces across Central America, including Honduras, is being leaked to the DTOs, making it difficult to provide assistance.\nFrom the development side, USAID funds under the Merida \nInitiative go to five areas: Community Gang Prevention; Rehabilitation; \nCommunity Infrastructure; Vocational Education; and Community \nPolicing.\n105 Much like security initiatives, most USAID programs were \nstopped during the Micheletti government and challenges remain in \nrestarting them.Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 95 |Even with the programs resuming, the general consensus from the \nHonduran government and other governments in the region is that the \nMerida Initiative and CARSI funds are welcome, but not enough to \ncounter the threat of organized crime.\nWhile Honduras is willing to extradite or expel foreign nationals \ncaught committing crimes, its constitution makes it very difficult if not \nimpossible to extradite Honduran criminals wanted in the United States. \nMany foreigners caught trafficking drugs at lower levels are simply held in prison for several weeks and then deported. Information sharing \namong the countries of the region and with the United States on this \nissue is weak.\nAgreements with the United States allow for the arrest and \nprosecution of traffickers, including Honduran nationals caught during \njoint operations in international waters.\nAdditional examples of U.S. support:\n\u2022\tThe FBI is providing counter-kidnapping training.\n\u2022\tThe U.S. government is assisting in modern crime fighting \ntechniques, including wiretapping of phones. While not in the public \nspace, it is likely that the United States has already provided, or will provide, training on computer forensics for electronic equipment \nseized from the cartels.\n\u2022\tThe DOJ is working to create task forces to crack down on financial \ncrime in Central America, though it could not be confirmed if this \nwas ongoing in Honduras. A clear bureaucratic counterpart at the \nFiscal\u00eda and the recent assets seizure law passed by Congress assist this effort.\nThe U.S. military has also resumed support to Honduras. General \nDouglas Fraser, Commander of the U.S. Southern Command, met with \nthe Honduran Defense Minister and the U.S. Ambassador on May 17, \n2010 to formally reestablish military aid. JTF-Bravo has resumed ties with the Honduran military and is performing humanitarian missions James Bosworth| 96 |inside of Honduras. It also assisted in coordinating information that led \nto a 400 kilo seizure at sea just weeks after military aid was restored.106\nIn April 2010 the countries renovated the Honduran naval base in \nCaratasca, La Mosquitia, and the United States offered four fast boats, \nvalued at $2.6 million. On June 8, 2010, the U.S. Southern Command \ndonated 25 all-terrain vehicles worth US$812,000 to Honduras\u2019 \nmilitary. The vehicles will be assigned to Special Forces units in La \nVenta, Francisco Moraz\u00e1n, and La Brea, Col\u00f3n. Honduras was also \nable to participate in the Panamax exercises in 2010, following a forced \nabsence in 2009.\nInformation sharing between the militaries has been restored and \nis increasing, according to officials interviewed in both militaries. In September 2010, the United States and Honduras signed an accord that \nallows for joint operations between Honduran and U.S. authorities and \nprovides guidance about the jurisdiction for suspects arrested.\nWhile the benefit to the fight against organized crime is undeniable, \nthis normalization of military relations, without reforms within the military to remove those who participated in the coup, has disturbed \nmany human rights and democracy advocates. Within the U.S. Congress, \nthere is a proposal to condition a certain percentage of military aid on \nhuman rights requirements, as has been done in Colombia and more \nrecently Mexico.  A letter from 30 members of the U.S. Congress led \nby Representative Sam Farr dated 19 October 2010 recommended a \ncomplete cut in assistance to Honduras.\n107  \nConclusion\nAsked about the recent evolution of organized crime in Honduras, \none U.S. official said, \u201cIt became worse under Zelaya and then exploded \nunder Micheletti.\u201d He went on to say that the Lobo government may \nbe making some slight improvements, but that the situation it inherited \nmade the current government\u2019s job incredibly difficult.\nThroughout the interviews for this paper, a constant refrain was \nthat organized crime had benefited from the political situation in 2009, \nparticularly the months following the coup. Political leaders and security forces were focused on other issues while international cooperation and Honduras: Organized Crime Gained Amid Political Crisis| 97 |information sharing was cut off. Mexican DTOs and other criminal \ngroups, which had been expanding their presence for years, moved \nquickly to step into the governance vacuum and greatly increase the \namount of illicit trafficking and violence occurring in the country. Even \nthough the political crisis appears past its peak, these organizations have \nsolidified their strength in many areas.\nThough elections were held, Honduras\u2019s domestic and international \npolitical situation remains tenuous. A significant minority of the population actively rejects the legitimacy of the elections that brought \nPresident Lobo to office while others who were prominent during \nthe interim government have implied that Lobo\u2019s stability is at stake if \nhe makes too many concessions to the factions that supported Zelaya. \nSeveral regional governments have not recognized the Lobo government \nand have not allowed its reincorporation into the OAS and other \nhemispheric organizations.\nHowever, along with this difficult political situation remains a security \ncrisis that should be an urgent priority for Honduras and its neighbors. Transnational criminal groups have a strong presence in the country and \nthe violent crime rate is among the highest in the world. Honduras faces \na serious long-term stability threat from organized crime. \nEndnotes\n1  The best estimates by U.S. and Honduran officials place the number between \n350 and 550 tons.

Some 9,000 combatants \nof the Marxist-led Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front ( Frente \nFarabundo Mart\u00ed para la Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional -FMLN) demobilized. The \nU.S.-backed military shrank from 63,000 during the war to 17,000 today \nand was purged of its most egregious human rights abusers. A new police \nforce, including members of both the FMLN and government forces, was \nformed and the traditional, repressive security forces disbanded. As one \nobserver wrote, \u201cmost Salvadorans clearly viewed the (peace) accords as \nan historic opportunity to construct a new country and a new society, \nnot simply as a set of technical measures to end the armed conflict.\u201d2\nThere is no question the peace accords fundamentally transformed the \npolitical structure of the country. In 2009 the FMLN-backed candidate won the presidency for the first time, ending the long-time dominance \nof the Republican Nationalist Alliance ( Alianza Republicana Nacionalista-\nARENA), a party founded by supporters of right-wing death squads that terrorized the nation in the 1970s and 1980s. Just as the FMLN \nmoderated from its Marxist roots, ARENA moderated from the extreme \nanti-Communist ideology on which it was founded. The peaceful 2009 election of Mauricio Funes, a former journalist and the FMLN-backed \ncandidate for the presidency, marked a truly historic moment in El \nSalvador\u2019s political life.\nYet today El Salvador is a crucial part of a transnational \u201cpipeline\u201d \nor series of overlapping, recombinant chains of actors and routes that \ntransnational criminal organizations use to move illicit products, money, Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 105 |weapons, personnel, and goods. The results are devastating and wide-\nranging in the Massachusetts-sized country, and are a key part of the \ncrisis of governance and rule of law crippling the Central American \nregion and Mexico.\nIn a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times , Funes acknowledged \ndrug trafficking organizations had infiltrated the police and judiciary \nand increased in power and range of operations. Asked who controls \nthe flow of illicit drugs in El Salvador, Funes responded, \u201cEverybody. There are Salvadoran cartels in connection with Colombian cartels. \nGuatemalan cartels are there. And recently we have found evidence of \nthe presence of Los Zetas (a particularly violent Mexican organization).\u201d\n3\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimates that \nbetween 545 and 707 metric tons of cocaine are shipped to the United \nStates each year from Colombia and other producing nations, and of \nthat amount, 90 percent of the product (500 to 630 metric tons) enters \nthrough the Central America-Mexico route. More specifically, some 69 \npercent (376 to 488 metric tons) pass through the Eastern Pacific vector, \nmeaning the Pacific coasts of Colombia and Ecuador, through Central \nAmerica and on to Mexico, of which El Salvador is an integral part.4 \nAccording to the State Department\u2019s annual report, in 2009 El Salvador \nseized less than 4 metric tons of cocaine, or roughly, at best, 1 percent of \nthe cocaine passing through.5\nEl Salvador also is an important money-laundering center. The State \nDepartment annual report lists El Salvador as a \u201ccountry of concern,\u201d \nnoting that\nEl Salvador has one of the largest and most developed banking \nsystems in Central America. The growth of El Salvador\u2019s financial sector, the increase in narcotics trafficking, the large volume of remittances through the formal financial sector and alternative remittance systems, and the use of the US dollar as legal tender make El Salvador vulnerable to money laundering.\n6\nIn one recent incident that demonstrates the amount of money moving \nthrough the country, in September 2010 police investigators found two \nplastic barrels full of $100 bills and Euro notes on a small farm outside Douglas Farah| 106 |the town of Zacatecoluca, in central El Salvador. The first barrel was \nreported to contain $7,196,850 in U.S. dollars and 1,684,500 Euros, and \nthe second barrel had a similar amount.7\nPerhaps the most shocking indicator of the depths of the criminality \nand security challenges facing El Salvador is its homicide rate, which is now far higher than it was during the war and in recent years, routinely \namong the highest in the world. It is worth noting in the regional context \nthat El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras measure consistently among \nthe highest five murder rates globally, ranging from 50 to 71 homicides \nper 100,000 citizens. This compares to about 5 murders per 100,000 in \nthe United States and 1.7 in Canada. The murder rate for people aged 15 to 24 in El Salvador was an almost-unimaginable 94 per 100,000, the \nhighest in the world.\n8\n\u201cApart from its economic costs, which are concrete and indisputable, \none of the main reasons why this is a crucial issue is that violence \nand crime are affecting the day-to-day decisions of the population, \nmaking insecurity a clear hindrance to human development,\u201d \nsaid Rebeca Grynspan, principal author of the United Nations \nDevelopment Program\u2019s. 2009-2010  report on Human Development \nin Central America.\u201dOne of the most difficult costs to quantify is \nthat of lost freedoms.\u201d\nGrynspan added that \u201cviolence is affecting one of the essential forms \nof freedom. No aspect of human security is as basic as keeping the \npopulation from being victimized by fear and physical violence.\u201d9\n As a result of the extensive transnational organized crime actions, \ngang activity, impunity and homicide rate, citizen safety ranks as the public\u2019s deepest concern. A shocking, high profile mass killing in June \nin which 16 people were killed inside of two city buses by one of the \ntransnational gangs that control much of the national territory brought \nnew calls for immediate action against the gangs. \nOne of the buses was sprayed with automatic weapons fire while the \nother was doused with gasoline and set on fire with all the passengers inside, including a 4-month-old baby. Police said the violence was \naimed at bus drivers who refused to pay \u201cprotection money\u201d to the gang \nmembers who control territory along the routes the buses plied.\n10 Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 107 |President Funes branded the attacks \u201cacts of terrorism,\u201d and the \nincidents provided the necessary impetus for the National Assembly to \noverwhelmingly pass a tough new law designating membership in a gang, \nregardless of individual activity, the crime of \u201ccriminal associations,\u201d \npunishable by jail time. Funes also dispatched 1,000 army troops to \nsupport the police in combating gang activity, in addition to the 5,000 \ntroops already deployed.11\nThe economic toll of the violence is also enormous. According to a \nrecent estimate, crime in El Salvador generates losses of 25 percent of the annual GDP.\n12 The situation is so deteriorated that many people view the \ncivil war as \u201cthe good old days.\u201d \nAs Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), who has been closely involved \nwith El Salvador policy for years, recently noted, the situation has gotten worse since the war rather than better.\nLittle could I have imagined the violence in El Salvador becoming worse after \nthe war, but it has. Criminal networks have invaded the country and they use it to \ntraffic drugs, guns, human beings and other contraband throughout the hemisphere.  \nYouth gangs are exploited, poor neighborhoods are terrorized, security and judicial \nauthorities are corrupted, and crime, violence and murder have exploded.\n13\nThere are multiple reasons for El Salvador\u2019s current crisis: \ndemographics, endemic poverty, weak civil institutions after decades of \nmilitarization of the government, land tenure patterns that still favor \na small elite, the mass deportation of gang members from the United \nStates, the enduring inability of the post-war governments to end the \nculture of impunity that has endured for generations, the privatization of \nstate security functions, and many others.\nHowever, this paper touches on only a few of those issues while \nexamining how El Salvador has become a central hub for regional and transnational criminal organizations and the multiple impacts this \norganized crime has evolved in the country.Douglas Farah| 108 |The Enduring Transnational Pipelines and the Role of \nGeography\nOne of the major shortcomings of the Salvadoran peace process (and \nperhaps one of the major failings of similar processes in Nicaragua and \nGuatemala) was a failure to appreciate the depth of the key clandestine networks that supplied both sides of the Salvadoran conflict with \nweapons, intelligence and broad international networks. Despite the general demobilization when the peace accords were implemented, \nmany of these structures, particularly in urban areas, remained largely \nintact, and in a relatively short period of time morphed into heavily \narmed and well-trained criminal organizations.\nA major investigation of post-conflict armed groups in 1994 found \nthat the \u201cillegal armed groups\u201d operating after the war had \u201cmorphed\u201d \ninto more sophisticated, complex organizations than had existed during the war, and that, as self-financing entities they had a strong economic \ncomponent, as well as political aspect, to their operations.\n14\nAfter the conflict officially ended in 1992, small groups on both sides \ndid not disarm, but kept their weapons, safe houses and logistical hubs. On the right, groups linked to a Cuban American faction whose most \nvisible face was Luis Posada Carriles, remained.\n15 On the left it was \nprimarily groups of the Communist Party (PC), the smallest of the five \ngroups that made up the FMLN during the war.16\nHowever, there was a significant difference in these networks from \nthe days of conflict. With the end of the Cold War, the ideological frameworks of both the left and the right weakened greatly. This shift \nfrom an ideological to economic basis for operating allowed for the \nnetworks of the extreme left and extreme right, both with cadres of \nhighly trained former combatants, to work together.\nThese groups, often taking over the leadership of local gangs that \nwere forming at the time, immediately provided a new level of sophistication and brutality to several other types of existing criminal \nactivities run by the gangs and smaller criminal bands, some of which \nhad been operational for years and had proven to be lucrative. The \nprimary activities were human trafficking, as El Salvador was a hub not \nonly for its own citizens seeking to enter the United States illegally, but \nwas central to almost all regional trafficking activities. The groups also Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 109 |began to take over kidnapping rings, weapons trafficking operations and \ntrafficking in stolen vehicles, giving them an economic base from which \nto grow.17 \nThe newly-acquired ability of these erstwhile ideological enemies to \nwork together was demonstrated with the 1995 kidnapping of Andr\u00e9s Suster, as these groups moved into that lucrative criminal field as well. \nThe victim was the 15-year-old son of Sa\u00fal Suster, the best friend and \nclose adviser of Alfredo Cristiani, the president who had signed the \npeace agreement with the FMLN.  \nInitial suspicion fell on the far right groups, who had carried out \nmultiple high-profile kidnappings in the past, as revenge for Cristiani\u2019s acceptance of the peace accords. However, police investigations in El \nSalvador, aided by special U.S. anti-kidnapping groups led by the FBI, \npointed to the abduction being the work of the PC. Raul Granillo, a \nformer senior commander of the PC, and one of his former lieutenants, \nwho were convicted of the crime. Granillo escaped arrest and remains \nat large.\n18 \nBut further investigations showed that while PC operatives carried \nout the abduction (and several others, including several in Brazil), \nthe kidnappers were in fact working on behalf of wealthy right-wing \nbusinessmen who provided payment, safe houses and muscle from their \nown armed groups.19 The precise motive of the kidnapping remains \nunclear, but sources close to the case believe it was carried out for a \ncombination of political and economic reasons. Over time these criminal \nelements formed the backbone of the main organized crime groups that \nwould come to dominate in El Salvador, controlling the trafficking of \ncocaine, weapons, illegal immigrants, stolen cars and other items.\nThe skill of the cadre of highly trained and well-armed individuals \nwith the ability to control physical space inside the country, operate intelligence and counter-intelligence groups and form alliances with \npowerful political and economic interest groups was a significant \ndevelopment. It is similar in some ways to the post-conflict developments \nin Guatemala and Nicaragua. In Guatemala, the military and its elite \nunits have maintained a powerful web of political and intelligence \nalliances, and in Nicaragua both leaders of the Sandinista government \nand the Contra rebels intelligence structures have allied with drug \ntrafficking groups to raise their operational capabilities. Douglas Farah| 110 |This phenomenon of the sophistication of former combatants entering \nthe criminal world explains in part why El Salvador in particular, and \nmuch of Central America more broadly, emerged in the mid and late \n1990s with sophisticated armed structures seemingly overnight. Rather \nthan spending years developing the capacities to form highly structured \ncriminal enterprises, they simply adapted wartime structures and tactics \nto criminal activities.\nThe ability to control territory, in a region crisscrossed with traditional \nsmuggling routes, is also one of the reasons the primary activity of the criminal groups in El Salvador revolves around transporting illicit goods. \nProducing no indigenous cocaine or heroin, El Salvador\u2019s geographic \nlocation is its value added contribution to the criminal pipeline \nstructure traversing the region from Mexico to Colombia. Most of the \norganizations in El Salvador that participate in the drug trade are called \ntransportistas\n20 because their primary role revolves around transportation \nand protection, while Mexican and Colombian groups are the managers \nand ultimate owners of the product.21\nAnother important element retained by both sides of the conflict are \nstill-functioning intelligence networks, particularly in the new police force, where both the old guard of the security forces and many of the \nFMLN recruits retained a loyalty to their old organizations rather than \nto the new institution. While the government formed a new, centralized \nintelligence structure after the signing of the peace accords in 1992, \nsources with direct involvement in the field say it has far fewer resources to \nwork with than the private networks. Sources with direct knowledge of intelligence operations said that the FMLN party largely relies on Cuban \nintelligence services for training and Venezuela for ample funding, while \nthe old guard of the radical right maintains a sophisticated intelligence \nstructure built on Cold War alliances. Both groups reportedly have more \nresources and capacity than the government agency.\n22\nThe interconnectedness of the organized crime groups in the \nregion was exposed in the gruesome February 2007 murder of three \nSalvadoran representatives to the Central American Parliament as they \ndrove to Guatemala City to attend a meeting. The bodies of the three \nparliamentarians and their driver were burned, as was their vehicle, at a \nfarm inside Guatemala, just off the main highway. Within a few days four \nGuatemalan policemen were arrested for the crime, which authorities Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 111 |said was a case of mistaken identity, where the politicians were mistaken \nfor drug traffickers. But the Guatemalan policemen were themselves \nmurdered inside a high security prison before they could testify.23\nThe jailed policemen were killed by shots to the head at close range and \nhad their throats slit, indicating the assailants had high level protection and cooperation in order to get weapons inside the prison, carry out \nthe murders, and leave unmolested. The crime remains unresolved. U.S. \nFBI investigators sent to assist the Guatemalans left in dismay, saying the \nGuatemalan government had deliberately impeded their efforts to solve \nthe homicides.\n24\nAll three of the parliamentarians were members of ARENA, \nincluding Eduardo D\u2019Aubuisson, the son of the party\u2019s founder, Roberto D\u2019Aubuisson. Intelligence sources in the region said the killings appeared \nto be the result of a drug deal gone bad, or an attempt to steal money the \nthree were believed to be carrying to purchase drugs. A theory with less \ncurrency, given the style of killing and subsequent impunity, is that the \nthree were killed in a case of mistaken identity. While the case remains \nunresolved, it clearly showed how the organized criminal groups reach across the region\u2019s borders.\nThe geographic location of El Salvador is a significant advantage \nin the operations of criminal organizations. It has long made it a key \ntransit point for drug trafficking from Colombia and the Andean region \nto Mexico and the United States, as well as human trafficking and the \nmovement of other illicit products. With a lengthy and unguarded \nPacific coast, porous borders with both Guatemala and Honduras and only a small gulf separating it from Nicaragua, El Salvador sits astride \nconvenient land and sea transit routes.\nWhile the war made it difficult for drug traffickers to exploit this \npath, the FMLN and right-wing groups took ample advantage of \nsmuggling routes to meet their logistical needs. The FMLN depended on \nmedical and logistical and supplies, along with some weapons and much \nammunition arriving from Honduras and Nicaragua, while buying and capturing many weapons from the Salvadoran military. The FMLN also \nbuilt a significant international support structure in Europe and other \nrevolutionary movements in Latin America.  \nGroups on the far right, particularly the non-state actors, primarily \nmoved their supplies from across the Guatemalan border, where like-Douglas Farah| 112 |minded groups operated. Like the FMLN, they built an extensive \ninternational support network with military dictatorships in Latin \nAmerica and the wealthy exile communities of Nicaraguan, Cuban and \nCentral American expatriates, mostly living in Miami.25\nIt is important to note that these international structures continue \nto be important to the criminal operations. This is particularly true \nfor the remnants of the PC of the FMLN and its current and past ties \nto the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Fuerzas Armadas \nRevolucionarias de Colombia- FARC). The FARC is now one of the largest \nproducers of cocaine in the world and a primary exploiter of the Central \nAmerican pipeline, as will be discussed below in detail.26\nThe factors that made El Salvador easy to penetrate in the past have \nnot improved in the post-war era. A senior Salvadoran security official estimated that El Salvador had more than 300 unmonitored points of \nentry, and said that even those that are monitored provide virtually no \nscreening of goods and people entering or leaving national territory. \nHe noted that corruption at the borders remains endemic; there have \nbeen numerous investigations into immigration corruption at Comalapa \nInternational Airport, almost all involving the movement of cocaine and/or suspected drug money, and seaports remain largely uncontrolled.\n27\nThe Rise of Gangs and the Changing Alliances\nWhen \u201cFirst Generation\u201d28 gangs began to appear in El Salvador \nin the early 1990s, they were largely made up of young men who had \nentered the United States illegally, often as children. After joining \ngangs and serving time in U.S. prisons, usually for felonies, they were \ndeported to their country of origin, El Salvador, despite often having no \nfamily there, and having limited or non-existent Spanish language skills. \nThese people turned to each other for survival and replicated the gang \nstructures and cultures they had learned in the United States, primarily in the Los Angeles area. \nWhile there are many dozens of gangs that have tens of thousands of \nmembers, the largest two by far, responsible for the vast majority of the \nviolence as well as ties to organized criminal organizations are the Mara \nSalvatrucha  (MS 13) and the Calle 18 gangs. Their power derives in part Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 113 |from their ruthlessness but also because of their truly transnational reach, \noperating not only in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, but across \nhundreds of cities in the United States. The FBI estimates that just the \nMS 13 operates in 42 states and has 6,000 to 10,000 active members in \nthe United States.29\nFigure 1: Source:  USAID\u2019s Central America and Mexico Gang Assessment\nThe gangs began an aggressive recruitment campaign, primarily in \nthe poor neighborhoods ringing the main urban centers of San Salvador and San Miguel. They imported their tattoo symbology, hand sign \nlanguage and inter-gang warfare with them.\n30\nThese gangs, with tens of thousands of members by the mid-1990s, \nsoon overwhelmed the capacity of the new police force in El Salvador, \nas well as in Honduras and Guatemala. In El Salvador, many newly \ndemobilized combatants found homes in the gangs, quickly pushing \nthem to Second Generation operations.\nIn this time period, the primary function of the gangs was to protect \ncocaine shipments from Colombian drug trafficking organizations as \nthey traveled by land across Central America. Often the Mexican drug traffickers accept the handover of the cocaine in El Salvador, and then \nmove the product north through Guatemala, Mexico and into the Vulnerable youth at risk of joining a gangNeighborhood gang membersGang cell membersTransnational\ngang leadershipOrganized crime \nand international\nnarco-activity bossesDouglas Farah| 114 |United States. The gangs often also exchanged weapons left over from \nthe war, or stolen cars, with the different cartels in exchange for a small \npercentage of the cocaine.31 \nThis payment in kind rather than in cash has become a major factor \nin the escalating violence. Once the gangs received cocaine they had \nto create a local market to absorb it in order to earn cash. This narco \nmenudeo  or small scale retail of cocaine and crack has set off an ongoing \nbattle among different gangs for control over neighborhoods and street corners where the drugs could be sold, leading to widespread bloodshed. \nA similar dynamic is responsible for much of the violence in other high-risk areas such as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in Mexico, where gangs also fight for \ncontrol of local distribution.\nFew would dispute that many of the gang structures in El Salvador, \nat the upper levels often led by former combatants, are truly \u201cthird \ngeneration.\u201d This is defined as having clearly become \u201cinternationalized, \nnetworked and complicated structures that sometimes involve political \naims\u201d and work with transnational criminal organizations.  As a 2006 USAID study of gangs in five Central American countries found,  \nSince the end of the 1980s period of armed conflict, gang violence has evolved from a localized, purely neighborhood-based security concern into a \ntransnational problem that pervades urban enclaves in every country in the \nregion. The two predominant Central American gangs, Mara Salvatrucha \n(MS-13) and the 18th Street gang (Barrio 18), while originating in the \nLos Angeles region of the United States, have capitalized on globalization \ntrends and communications technologies to acquire arms, power, and influence \nacross the United States, Mexico, and Central America. Gang activity has developed into a complex, multi-faceted, and transnational problem that \ncannot be solved by individual countries acting alone. New approaches are \nneeded to curb the social and material devastation wrought by these extremely \nviolent networks.\n32Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 115 |President Funes acknowledged this transformation, saying\nAt the beginning, the gangs were just a group of rebel youngsters. As time \nmoved on, the gangs became killers for hire. Now the situation is that the gangs have become part of the whole thing. They control territory and they \nare disputing territory with the drug traffickers. Why? Because they need to \nfinance their way of life: basically, getting arms.\n33\nBut the \u201cthird generation\u201d gangs are no longer independent of the \ndrug cartels, but rather have become integral part of their structures, \nat least at the most senior and sophisticated level. As the Mexican and \nU.S. governments have moved to confront the Mexican drug cartels in \nMexico, these connections with the transnational gangs have facilitated \nthe ability of Mexican organizations to rapidly expand their theater of \noperations across Mexico\u2019s southern border.34 The Mexican cartels are \n\u201cspreading their horizons to states where they feel, quite frankly, more comfortable,\u201d DEA chief of operations David Gaddis told the Washington \nPost. \u201cThese governments in Central America face a very real challenge \nin confronting these organizations.\u201d\n35\nThe Perrones  and the Penetration of the Political \nStructures\nIn El Salvador over the past two years, according to intelligence and law enforcement officials, the Mexican organizations, particularly \nthe Sinaloa cartel, have established relations with Salvadoran cocaine \ntransport networks. The alliances span the political spectrum.\nWhile the cocaine is produced by Colombian organizations, the \nMexican organizations formally assume control of the product in \nColombia or Ecuador and work with and through a variety of transport \ngroups to move the product by sea and air to Central America until the product is in Mexico.\nEcuador is an increasingly important production center for HCL \n(refined cocaine), particularly the HCL produced by the FARC, \nwhich operates extensively along the Colombia-Ecuador border in the Douglas Farah| 116 |Putumayo-Sucumb\u00edos region. In addition to the FARC, other smaller \norganizations also have important HCL laboratories in the area. Because \nof the relative ease of accessing the Pacific coast routes from Ecuador, \nthe Mexican cartels are increasingly picking up the HCL in Ecuador and \nmoving it up the Pacific coast to El Salvador and elsewhere.36 \nThe largest of these transportation groups in El Salvador is known as \nLos Perrones Orientales , operating in and around the eastern cities of San \nMiguel, Usulut\u00e1n and La Uni\u00f3n. This group takes custody of the cocaine that arrives on El Salvador\u2019s Pacific coast from Colombia and Ecuador, \nand is charged with protecting the product on a fleet of trucks that move \nwestward toward Guatemala, or north to cross into Honduras. Once \nacross the border, the drugs are turned over to Mexican or Guatemalan trafficking structures. \nThe Perrones Orientales , in turn, are allied with an organization known \nas Los Perrones Occidentales , who operate around the city of Santa Ana and \ncontrol corridors for transporting cocaine, weapons and human traffic by land into Guatemala.\nWhat made the Perrones  unique in El Salvador\u2019s organized criminal \nstructure, police officials said, was: \n\u2022\tTheir close alliance with Mexican drug cartels, particularly the \nSinaloa syndicate; \n\u2022\tTheir adoption of Mexican drug culture, including the purchase \nof thoroughbred race horses, the purchase of expensive cars and \nthe construction of race tracks to race them on, and a fondness for narco-corridas , the musical tributes to their deeds;\n\u2022\t Their sophisticated intelligence network through the police and \nother state officials; their involvement in multiple illicit activities, \nfrom trafficking in stolen cars, weapons, human beings and cocaine; \nand their regional reach, from Nicaragua to Guatemala, with \nbranches operating in Honduras.\n37\n\u201cThey ( Perrones ) have become very economically powerful and now, \nin parts of the country, the political system is relying on them,\u201d said one \nsenior police official who has investigated the group. \u201cThey are trying Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 117 |to become mini Mexican cartels. Culturally, they are very close to the \nMexicans.\u201d38\nMany of those allegedly belonging to the Perrones Orientales have been \ninvolved in running contraband and stolen goods through the region for \nmany years, including the contraband of cheese from Honduras. This \nhas given rise to calling some in the group the cartel de los quesos \u201d or the \nCheese Cartel, and helps explain the organization\u2019s reach into Honduras.\nThe trafficking of drugs represented in many ways an easy expansion \nof these long-time illicit transportation pipelines, where the protection of customs officials and local law enforcement was already established. The addition of cocaine to the pipeline added orders of magnitude to \nthe profits for all involved but represented relatively little risk to the \ntransporters. \nOne indication of the regional relationships that exist is that the \nalleged head of the Perrones Orientales, Reynerio de Jes\u00fas Flores Lazo, fled \nto Honduras because he was warned by a corrupt Salvadoran policeman \nthat his arrest was imminent. In Honduras, Flores was arrested after six months at the request of Interpol when reward seekers turned him in.\n39 \nThe extensive reach of the Perrones Orientales  came to light in 2008 \nwhen the police arrested several dozen people, including senior police officials and several locally powerful politicians in the San Miguel \narea for their ties to the criminal group. According to public reports \nas the investigations unfolded, at least 43 police officers are under \ninvestigation in the case, many of them members of the U.S.-funded \nelite Anti-Narcotics Division ( Divisi\u00f3n Anti-Narc\u00f3tico- DAN). Among \nthose suspended from his job and still under investigation in the case is Godofredo Miranda, who was the DAN commander.\n40  \nAn internal police report obtained by the author links the Perrones  \nto prominent political personalities in the eastern part of the country, where the right-wing ARENA party has dominated and the National \nConciliation Party ( Partido de Conciliaci\u00f3n Nacional- PCN), traditionally \nlinked to the military, remains a force. The document outlines the Perrones  ties to businesses for laundering money, bribes for protection, \nand ties to extensive influence within municipalities in the region.\n41\nIn one case that became public, the attorney general\u2019s office said the \nowner of a large car sale business in San Miguel gave cars to a PCN member of the National Assembly that were used to bribe at least 10 Douglas Farah| 118 |local mayors and other officials. Investigators said they found the \nbusiness claimed to have done $13.2 million worth of business but could \nonly account for about $30,000 of that amount.42 The flow of funds was \nallegedly used to bribe officials to allow the unmolested transport of drugs through their regions as well as to launder the proceeds.\nMany of those initially arrested on charges of belonging to the Perrones \nstarted off mired in poverty and acquired unexplained fortunes. Such \nwas the case of Flores, who began his economic life fetching water on \na mule for sale in his hometown of Bol\u00edvar, near the Honduran border. \nHe branched out into Honduras, where he was reportedly involved in cheese smuggling and other contraband activities, before moving on to \ndrug trafficking.\n43\nPolice officials said the group not only laundered money from its \nown criminal activities but helped launder money for Mexican drug organizations through a series of seemingly-legitimate businesses in \nand around San Miguel. A Mexican woman known a \u201cLa Patrona\u201d was \nthe main contact for delivering money from the Mexican cartels to be \nlaundered.\n44\nAccording to the police document, the reach of the Perrones extends \nto the national political level, as well as the senior levels of the police, the \njudicial system and the attorney general\u2019s anti-narcotics unit. Evidence \nof the power of the organization, law enforcement and intelligence \nofficials said, was the fact that many of the cases against leading members \nof the gang were being dismissed or the charges reduced, while only a \nfew low-level members have been convicted.45\nThe relationship among more structured groups like the Perrones \nand the gangs such as the MS-13 remains ambiguous and in flux. Law enforcement officials say there are documented cases of the gangs fighting \nwith the Perrones for territory and transportation routes, but that most of \nthe time the gangs are employed as muscle for transportista organizations. \nWhile the Perrones and other smaller groups take care of paying off the \nproper authorities and orchestrate the border crossings, the gangs are often used as the triggermen to make sure arrangements are enforced.\nHowever, there are indications that the upper level gang leadership is \nbeing targeted for recruitment by the Zetas  because of their ruthlessness \nand their usefulness as enforcers. In addition, they provide a web of \ncontacts, markets and security arrangements on the U.S. side of the Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 119 |Mexico-U.S. border to which the Zetas  would not otherwise have access. \nIntelligence officials said the Zetas  have not established a permanent \npresence in El Salvador but have key people in Guatemala that they send \nin regularly.46\nIn addition to recruiting gang members as muscle, the sources said the \nMexican cartels, particularly the Zetas,  were also recruiting the special \nforces operatives in the Salvadoran military because of their military expertise. While many have retired since the end of the war, several \ndozen active duty officers who received extensive U.S. Special Forces \ntraining during the civil war have been approached. The success rate \nof the recruitment efforts is not known, but many of those approached \nwere identified for the Mexican organizations by disgruntled retired senior military officials. The recruitment efforts of military cadres have \nstepped up since Funes took office because many of the military leaders \nduring the war are bitter about the FMLN electoral victory.\n47\nMoving the Drugs and Money\nThe primary method for moving cocaine from Colombia and Ecuador to El Salvador is through go-fast light boats, which can often stop to \nrefuel at pre-positioned \u201cmother ships\u201d disguised as fishing vessels, or \non the increasingly popular semi-submersible and submersible crafts \ndeveloped by the drug trafficking organizations.\n48 \nGo-fast boats, so named because they use multiple large outboard \nmotors to be able to outrun virtually any law enforcement vessel, are \ngenerally considered the most reliable method for transporting cocaine. \nHowever, the boats cannot carry large loads, and are often run aground \nand abandoned once they have been used.\nSemi-submersibles ride just above the waveline and are almost \nimpossible to detect by radar or overflying aircraft. In the past two years the drug traffickers have made signficant techological strides in \nmanufacturing the vehicles, increasing their range, safety and carrying \ncapacity. There has been a corresponding increase in their use by drug \ntrafficking organizations. Douglas Farah| 120 |The vessels are now able to travel from the Colombian and Ecuadoran \nlaunching sites on the Pacific to El Salvador and Guatemala without \nrefueling. If more fuel is needed it is often provided by fishing boats \nsent to a meeting point, easily located with GPS technology. The boats \ncan carry up to 10 tons of cocaine, but average between 5-6 tons per \nshipment. \nWhile it used to take 90 days to manufacture the boats, it now takes \nabout 35, as the technology for building the fiberglass-hulled vessels has improved and the drug traffickers are now able to prefabricate and \nstandardize construction. The average cost per vessel is about $1 million, \nand they are often sunk after one trip, a part of doing business.\n49\nAdmiral James Stavridis, when he was head of the U.S. Southern \nCommand, responsible for Latin America, described semi-submersibles as\n\u2026.a new and dangerous threat technology, vessels that can carry drugs, \nterrorists or weapons of mass destruction to our shores.\nIn ever-increasing numbers, these stealthy, pod-like vessels depart \nexpeditionary shipyards nested deep in the dense jungles and estuaries of the \nAndes region of Latin America. Carefully ballasted and well camouflaged, they ride so low in the water that they are nearly impossible to detect visually \nor by radar at any range greater than 3,000 yards. Loaded to capacity with \ntons of drugs they plod steadily and generally unobserved at less than ten knots toward designated drop-off points.\n50\nOnce the drugs are offloaded from the shipping vessel on the coast, \nthey are often stored in warehouses near the coast and then mixed with \nlegitimate products that travel by large trucks across the region on the \ntwo main highways that traverse El Salvador\u2014The Pan-American \nthrough the center of the country and the Litoral or Coastal highway that \nfollows the Pacific coast. Cocaine transiting El Salvador from countries to the south employs the same routes.\nThe cocaine is dropped in different safe havens along the Pacific coast, \nincluding Panama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and El Salvador. Eventually the product is funneled into Guatemala and then Mexico. This has led \nto the lucrative trade in transporting the cocaine. For example, drivers \ncarrying loads of cocaine from Nicaragua to Guatemala are reportedly Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 121 |paid about $15,000 a trip by the Mexican organizations, and those \nwho recruit the drivers are often given bonuses of $5,000 per recruit. \nEach of the Mexican groups maintains its own group of drivers across  \nCentral America.51  \nDue to the volume of regional truck traffic, corruption at check points \nand the lack of capacity to check cargo, these vehicles can then generally \ntravel anywhere in the region with relatively little risk. \nIn addition to hiding drugs and other contraband in legal shipments, \ntrucks often employ false panels and hidden compartments to ensure \nthat even in the vehicle were stopped by a policeman that had not been \nproperly bribed, the illicit produce would still be very difficult to find.\nThe Communist Party and the FARC\nWhile the political ties of the Perrones were mostly with the traditional \nrightist political structure, the FMLN, through the Communist Party \n(PC), has also had significant relationships to criminal activity, including \nhigh profile kidnappings. As noted earlier, factions of the PC and some \nof the other groups of the FMLN did not demobilize after the war, and \nmaintained not only their weapons, but their safe houses and logistics \ninfrastructures.52 \nThe most notorious was the safe bunker holding thousands of false \ndocuments and other materiel operated by the PC and FPL factions of \nthe FMLN in Managua, Nicaragua after the war ended and all sides \nwere supposed to have demobilized. The bunker, hidden under a car \nmechanic\u2019s garage, was exposed when ammunition inside it exploded, \nripping the top off.53\nSome members of the PC maintained ongoing relationships with \nother groups that had at one time been part of the Marxist revolutionary vanguard of the region. These include hard-line factions of the \nSandinistas in Nicaragua aligned with President Daniel Ortega, the \nFARC in Colombia, the MRTA in Peru and the Basque separatists of \nthe ETA.\n54 The FARC and ETA are designated terrorist entities by the \nUnited States and the European Union.55Douglas Farah| 122 |This transnational network, driven by economics rather than \nideology, has the advantage of being based on years of working together \nand the trust it engenders. One of the primary drug trafficking routes, \naccording to Salvadoran, Mexican and Colombian intelligence officials, \nruns through the FARC in Colombia and Ecuador to Nicaragua\u2019s former \nSandinista security structure, through PC members in San Salvador and \ninto Mexico.\nThe clearest documentation of the ongoing relationship between the \nPC and the FARC and international weapons market comes from the computers belonging to Ra\u00fal Reyes, the FARC\u2019s deputy commander \nwho was killed on March 1, 2008. When Reyes, living in a hard camp \ntwo kilometers inside Ecuadoran territory, was killed in a controversial \nraid by the Colombian military, Colombian officials found some 600 \ngigabytes of data on different computer hard drives and thumb drives.\n56 \nBecause of these documents, a clearer picture of the PC\u2019s involvement \nwith the FARC is available than the information regarding the Perrones.  \nIt is worth laying out in some detail here because it shows how an important part of the transnational criminal pipeline operates.  \nAmong the documents found in the cache were e-mails among \ndifferent FARC commanders about the help they were receiving \nin acquiring sophisticated weapons from an individual identified as \u201cRamiro\u201d in El Salvador, who FMLN members, Colombian intelligence \nand U.S. officials identified as the nom de guerre of Jos\u00e9 Luis Merino.\n57\nMerino is a senior member of the FMLN party, a position derived \nlargely from being the point man for receiving and distributing subsidized gasoline shipments from Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. The sale \nof the gasoline is a major source of income for the FMLN political party. \nWhile Merino has steadfastly refused to discuss the issue, Funes said he \nhad spoken to Merino about the e-mails and had been assured Merino \nhad no involvement in weapons sales to the FARC.\n58\nMerino\u2019s participation in the S\u00faster kidnapping had been widely \nreported and other former FMLN commanders say his group was responsible for numerous assassinations and kidnappings during and after \nthe war. Merino has declined to comment on the case to either the local \nor international media.\nDuring the war Merino commanded an elite urban commando unit \nthat carried out several spectacular hits, including the 1989 assassination Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 123 |of attorney general Roberto Garc\u00eda Alvarado. The assassination was \ncarried out by men on a motorcycle who strapped an explosive to the \nroof of Garc\u00eda\u2019s car, killing him while the assassins sped away unhurt.59  \nThe Salvadoran Truth Commission, which investigated the worst \nhuman rights abuses of the civil war as part of the peace agreements, did \nnot name Merino but concluded the assassination was carried out by the \narmed branch of the PC.60\nThe relationship between Merino and the FARC appears to have \nspanned many years and revolved around mutually beneficial economic \narrangements, many of them illegal.\nIn one 2003 e-mail, Reyes suggests the FMLN and FARC carry out \na joint kidnapping for $10 million to $20 million in Panama to raise \nmoney for the FMLN\u2019s 2004 electoral campaign, although there is no \nrecord of such a kidnapping having occurred. The profits, the e-mail \nsaid, would be \u201csplit down the middle.\u201d\nA 2004 missive describes a meeting of the FARC leadership with \n\u201cRamiro\u201d and a Belgian associate in Caracas, Venezuela to discuss the FARC and FMLN obtaining Venezuelan government contracts, \nthrough front companies, to operate waste disposal and tourism \nindustries. Interestingly, Merino then acquired a major interest in a \nmajor waste disposal company, Capsa, which operates in 52 Salvadoran \nmunicipalities.\n61\nIn another e-mail, Reyes recounts a 2005 meeting with \u201cRamiro\u201d \nwho reportedly boasted that he had gained full control of the FMLN and \nwas reorienting the party toward \u201cthe real conquest of power.\u201d \nBut the e-mail that caused the most concern in El Salvador is from \nSeptember 6, 2007, written by Iv\u00e1n Rios, a member of the FARC \nsecretariat, to other secretariat members. In it he lays out the multiple \nnegotiations under way for new FARC weapons, including the highly \ncoveted surface-to-air missiles:\n1) Yesterday I met two Australians who were brought here by Tino, \nthanks to the contact made by Ramiro (Salvador). We have been talking to them (the Australians) since last year.\n2) They offer very favorable prices for everything we need: rifles, \nPKM machine guns, Russian Dragunovs with scopes for snipers, Douglas Farah| 124 |multiple grenade launchers, different munitions...RPGs (rocket \npropelled grenades), .50 machine guns, and the missiles. All are made in Russia and China.3) For transportation, they have a ship, with all its documents in order, and the cargo comes in containers. The crew is Filipino and does not know the contents, with the exception of the captain and first mate. They only need a secure port to land at.\n4) They gave us a list of prices from last month, including \ntransportation.They offer refurbished Chinese AKs that appear as used, but in reality are new, and were not distributed to the Chinese army, which developed a new line of weapons, for $175. AK 101and 102, completely new, for $350. Dragunovs, new with scopes, $1,200.RPG launchers for $3,000 y grenades for $80. They say they have a thermobaric grenade that destroys everything in closed spaces (like the bombs the gringos use against Alqaeda (sic) hideouts) for $800. Chinese missiles (which they say are the most up-to-date at this time) with a 97 percent effective rate, $93,000, and 15,000 for the launchers. They say it is very easy to use, and they guarantee the training. If one of these missiles were identified inside Colombia it would cause them a lot of problems, but if, on the side they include old Russian SA-7 (shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles) it would serve to confuse, mislead or at least give the impression that the guerrillas have weapons of different types, not just Chinese. The ammunition for AKs is 21 cents a round, but if we buy more than 3 million rounds, the price drops to 9 cents a unit.\n5) (sic) They promised to give us an exact price on other material. \nTwo months ago they sent me a price list (very favorable, for example, a used .50 machine gun for $400, new for $3,000), but I didn\u2019t take the list to the meeting place.\n6) They do the purchasing without the need of a down payment, \nbut when the merchandise is on the ship, they want 50 percent. When it is delivered they collect the other 50 percent. The money Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 125 |moves through a bank in the Pacific, in an independent country \nwhere they can move money without any questions being asked. Once the cargo is shipped it can take one month, or a month and a half to arrive in Venezuela. They said we could have a representative, it doesn\u2019t matter what nationality, on board the ship while it sails to it final destination.\n62\nSubsequent e-mails on November 12 and November 23 indicate \nthat the Australians arrived in Venezuela to consummate the deal and \nR\u00edos said a person identified as \u201c El Cojo \u201d (The Cripple) was in charge \nof paying the first quota and logistics for whatever was to be delivered.\nWhile the end result of the meeting is not entirely clear, regional law \nenforcement officials believe that same pipeline moving illicit products, connecting parts of the PC to the FARC and elements of the former \nSandinista intelligence structure in Nicaragua, remains active. Daniel Ortega, the leader of the triumphant Sandinista revolution in 1979, was \nre-elected president of Nicaragua in 2006. \nSince at least the early 1990s Ortega has maintained a cordial \nrelationship with the FARC leadership. In 1998, Ortega, as the head of \nthe Sandinista party, awarded the Augusto Sandino medal, his party\u2019s \nhighest honor, to Manuel Marulanda, the commander-in-chief of the \nFARC. Various e-mails in the Reyes documents are addressed to Ortega directly and indicate that, at least until he returned to the presidency, he \nmaintained regular contact with the FARC leadership.\nIn 2008, following the bombing of the Reyes camp, Ortega granted \npolitical asylum to Nubia Calder\u00f3n, a leader of the FARC\u2019s International \nCommission, who was wounded in the attack. In addition, FARC \nemissary Alberto Berm\u00fadez was issued a Nicaraguan identity card by a \nmember of Nicaragua\u2019s Supreme Electoral Council. Berm\u00fadez, known as \u201cEl Cojo ,\u201d is believed by Salvadoran and Colombian authorities to be \nthe person mentioned above who received the FARC weapons shipment \narranged by Merino.\n63  Douglas Farah| 126 |The State Response and Human Rights Challenges\nSince the 1990s different Salvadoran administrations have wrestled with \nhow to control gang violence within the rule of law. Different versions \nof \u201cmano dura, \u201d or \u201ciron fist,\u201d policies have consistently failed to stem the \nrise in homicides, robberies and police corruption. President Funes, as \nnoted earlier, recently criminalized the act of belonging to a gang and has deployed the military to help police regain control of the streets of \nthe capital and other major cities, and expanded the military\u2019s powers to \ncarry out searches and arrests.  During his presidential campaign Funes \nand the FMLN had condemned similar policies proposed by ARENA. \nThe military deployment was authorized to last until June 2011, at a cost \nof some $10 million.\n64\nThese measures by Funes, as well as earlier actions by the ARENA \ngovernments, have consistently drawn criticism of international human rights groups, particularly the \u201cAnti-Terrorism\u201d law enacted in 2007 \nthat granted police extraordinary powers.\n65 \nThe Funes government was especially criticized because it had \npromised to take a different tack to try to control the social violence. Rather than the mano dura  of the ARENA governments, Funes had \npromised to try to deal with the social roots of the violence through community policing, youth sports programs, municipal level crime \nobservatories and greater restrictions on access to weapons. \nHowever, following the June, gang attacks on the buses, Funes said\n in \na speech on national radio and television that: \u201cWe know that in the long term the policies of social inclusion and prevention will deliver results, \nbut in the short term the violence is being fought with repression. And \nthis is what the government has been doing and will continue to do.\u201d\n66\nThe street violence is compounded by the ongoing deficiencies in the \njudiciary. Despite millions of dollars in foreign assistance to improve the judiciary, the State Department\u2019s 2010 report found that\nSubstantial corruption in the judicial system contributed to a \nhigh level of impunity, undermining the rule of law and the public\u2019s respect for the judiciary. Inadequate government funding of the PNC, combined with intimidation and killing of victims Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 127 |and witnesses, made it difficult to identify, arrest, and prosecute \nperpetrators of human rights abuses and other crimes, thus diminishing public confidence in the justice system.\n67\nMuch of the criticism has centered on the office of attorney \ngeneral, ( Fiscal\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica- FGR), long a stronghold of \nthe conservative ARENA party. The fiscal is named by the National \nAssembly, usually after much political negotiation, because to be named, \nthe nominee must receive two-thirds (56 of 84) votes. Because of the \ndelicate balancing act that leads to the deals for the naming of the fiscal it \nis almost impossible to remove the official without time consuming and difficult horse trading.\nAccording to U.S. and Salvadoran sources the FRG has consistently \nrefused to act on organized crime cases that have ties to conservative political groups. Senior police officials said the FRG has refused to move \non the most important Perrones  cases and has quietly returned many of \nthe vehicles and goods seized in police actions against the group.\n68\nRep. McGovern, who has long pushed judicial reform issues in El \nSalvador, has publicly called the FGR \u201cthe place where justice goes to die. Countless cases of murder, corruption, drug trafficking, money \nlaundering and other crimes are stymied within its halls...So, for example, \nif the Inspector General for the National Police finds criminal elements \nwithin the police force, what is she to do?  Send them to the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s Office where they simply languish or are quickly dismissed?  \nJust like the murder cases of community and environmental leaders in Caba\u00f1as?  Or the Katya Miranda case?  Or the murder of U.S. trade \nunionist Gilberto Soto?  Or cases involving the Perrones drug-trafficking \nnetwork?  And if these internationally-known cases go nowhere or are \ndeliberately led astray, what hope does the average Salvadoran have that \nhe or she will ever receive justice before the courts?\u201d\n69 \nIn addition to the enormous problems facing the FGR and other parts \nof the judicial structure, the post war police force, established in the hopes of ending years of official human rights abuses and corruption, \nis suffering from significant morale problems and growing internal \ncorruption.  Douglas Farah| 128 |The police force ( Polic\u00eda Nacional Civil -PNC) has seen its once-high \nratings as a trusted institution erode in recent years.  The inspector \ngeneral of the PNC said 167 Salvadoran police officials had been arrested \nin the first seven months of 2010 alone.70 \nA senior police official late last year acknowledged that his force had \n\u201ca high level of demoralization, due in part to the style of leadership here and in part to the economic conditions, which are deplorable. Our \nfinancial situation is critical, and we are running a deficit of $ 8 million \nto $10 million, which has left us practically prostrate economically and \nadministratively.\u201d\n71\nThe M\u00e9rida Initiative and the Central America \nRegional Security Initiative (CARSI)\nUnder the M\u00e9rida Initiative to combat drug trafficking and organized \ncrime in Mexico and Central America, begun under the Bush \nadministration and continued under the Obama administration, Mexico \nis to receive 84 percent of the funds ($1.32 billion) from FY 2008 to FY \n2010. Seven Central American nations divide the remaining 16 percent \n($258 million). \nThe Central American portion of the initiative was renamed the \nCentral America Regional Security Initiative in 2010.72  This amounts \nto roughly $12million a year for each of the Central American nations. \nGiven the vast shortfalls in the PNC and judiciary outlined above, the \namount El Salvador is to receive under CARSI is viewed as relatively \npaltry by Salvadoran officials.73\nThe five primary goals in the Central American aid package are: \nestablishing safe streets; disrupting the movement of criminals and contraband; building strong, capable and accountable governments; \nembedding government presence in communities at risk; and enhancing \nthe regional level of cooperation. \nTo this end, the funding will be used in El Salvador to: \n\u2022\tCreate vetted police units to work with the U.S. Drug Enforcement \n(DEA) in complex, multinational investigations into drug trafficking Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 129 |and money laundering cases. The aid includes investigative \nequipment and training for the unit.\n\u2022\tImproved Policing/Police Equipment program to address basic \ntransportation and communications needs, along with computer, \nand narcotics detection equipment. \n\u2022\tEnhance the Transnational Anti-Gang Initiative (TAG) by providing technical expertise and specialized equipment such as computers, \nsoftware, protective gear, radios, and vehicles to law enforcement \nagencies. The funding will support the deployment of FBI agents \nnot only to El Salvador but also to Guatemala and Honduras;\n\u2022\tSupport the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) \nin El Salvador, which provides training and technical assistance, supports institution building and enforcement capability, and fosters \nrelationships of American law enforcement agencies with their \ncounterparts in the Central American region.\n\u2022\tA program to improve Salvadoran prison management, considered \na crucial vulnerability in establishing the rule of law, given the \nendemic corruption in the prison system that allows detained gang leaders to continue to run their operations while serving time.\n74\nMost of the programs funded under CARSI are extensions or new \niterations of programs that have been tried in the past, with few positive \nresults. The most innovative is the prison management program, one \nthat Salvadoran officials said is fundamental. \nSenior civilian and police officials cited the inability to eradicate \ncorruption in the prison system, rife with abuses, corruption and \ninhumane overcrowding, as a key vulnerability for gang and organized \ncrime activity. Many of the murders carried out by the gangs in Central America and the United States are done on the orders of imprisoned gang \nleaders who use smuggled cellular telephones maintain their control in \nthe outside world.\n75 \nPolice officials and senior government officials said that, while the \nCARSI money was an important symbolic gesture, it was a virtual drop Douglas Farah| 130 |in the bucket when compared to the needs. Several expressed the unlikely \nhope that aid levels would be significantly increased in coming years.\nGiven the magnitude of the organized crime problem in El Salvador; \nthe multiple factors that contribute to the violence and erosion of state \nauthority; and the regional ties of Salvador\u2019s criminal structures to \nMexico and the rest of the region, it is clear that no matter how well \nintentioned the government may be, it cannot make significant advances \nthat are not part of a regional strategy. \nWhile CARSI is an important recognition on a policy level that the \nfates of Mexico and Central America are closely intertwined, it is also clear that there is a significant imbalance in the current allocation of \nresources between Mexico and the region. While Mexican drug cartels \nare clearly a high priority and are correctly viewed as the epicenter of \nnarcotics trafficking and organized crime that affects Central America, \nit is also clear that those cartels cannot be dismantled as long as they can move south into Central America. \nThe Reyes documents and multiple ongoing investigations indicate \nthat remnants of one-time revolutionary movements have formed a new \nalliance to engage in criminal activities that pass through El Salvador, \nusing long-established clandestine networks. The Perrones  case shows \nthat other criminal organizations with close ties to the Mexican drug cartels have gained significant access to the traditional political power structure in El Salvador controlled by the right, as well as the police \nand the judiciary. The structures, with political protection across the \npolitical spectrum, traffic not just in cocaine, but in human beings, \nweapons, stolen cars, exotic animals, bulk cash and many other projects.\nThese trafficking activities are not independent of the gang activities \nof extortion, kidnapping and armed robbery. Rather, they form a part \nof a continuum of criminal activities where short lived alliances can be achieved based on short term common interest and mutual benefit, only \nto broken when those conditions are no longer met. The breaking of \nalliances and territorial disputes both over turf and control of specific \ntrafficking routes in this superstructure and substrata of criminal activity \nleads to enormous levels of violence, social decomposition and the \nerosion of positive state attributes.\nGiven the current level of penetration of organized crime in the \npolitical, judicial and law enforcement structures of El Salvador, the Organized Crime In El Salvador: Its Homegrown  \nand Transnational Dimensions| 131 |situation is unlikely to improve in the short term. As Mexican cartels, \nunder pressure at home, push further south from their traditional homes, \nthe local groups will likely gain resources and strength, as well as added \nincentive to wage warfare among themselves for added territory. \nThe Funes administration, while showing some political will to \ntackle these issues, has not had the resources, political strength or space \nto move beyond the traditional remedies for the violence and criminal \nactivities, remedies which have failed repeatedly over the past decade. The CARSI also fails to look beyond the traditional strategies of police \nreform and increased repression in dealing with organized crime. While \nregional in its funding, there are few built-in mechanisms for regional \ninformation sharing or coordinated action against transnational criminal \norganizations.\nPerhaps the most relevant is the System for Central American \nIntegration ( Sistema de la Integraci\u00f3n Centroamericana- SICA), which has a \nstanding Commission for Central America Security, established to deal \nwith regional security issues.\n76 However, participants say that since the \ninstitution\u2019s founding in 1993 some progress has been made in economic integration but virtually none in integrating security systems.\n The CARSI funding offers some limited resources to help the \ngovernment tackle the security and criminal issues that pose the most \nsignificant challenges to the state. However, it is a relatively small effort, \ngiven that the Salvadoran state faces an array of groups that are better \nfinanced, better armed and more mobile than government forces.  \nEl Salvador\u2019s transnational organized criminal phenomenon and \ncollateral local crime and gang-related violence pose a significant threat to the nation\u2019s democratic governance and state legitimacy. The \noverwhelming problems must be faced at the state level, but also within \nthe deteriorating regional context. The criminal structures in Mexico, \nHonduras, and Guatemala all have a significant impact on El Salvador, as \nEl Salvador\u2019s structures have an impact on the other nations.\nWithout a costly and comprehensive regional and transnational effort \nto simultaneously address the complex issues of organized crime in Central America, the region\u2019s fragile democratic gains of the past decade \nwill likely be swept away. The hope generated by the peace processes \nthat ended the brutal Cold War conflicts will be exhausted and the table \nwill be set for future conflicts.Douglas Farah| 132 |Endnotes\n1  Field research for this paper was conducted during two visits to El Salvador, \nin March and August 2010, with support from the International Assessment and \nStrategy Center.

The USAID study (USAID, op. cit.) characterizes the senior gang membership as working \ndirectly with Mexican drug trafficking organizations in an integrated, organic \nway, the conclusion supported by my field research. However, other respected investigators say the intersection of interests and a working relationship does not constitute and organic link.

Unsuspecting \nshoppers enjoying a leisurely Independence Day at Guatemala \nCity\u2019s Tikal Futura Mall found themselves in the middle of a \nshootout. Hours later, media outlets reported that police had tried to arrest Mauro Salom\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez, who had been under indictment by the \nU.S. District Court in the Middle District of Florida (in Tampa) since \n2009, for conspiring to import 3.7 tons of cocaine into the United States \nfrom Guatemala\u2019s Atlantic coast. Ram\u00edrez escaped from the Guatemalan police, but he left behind a trail of death and many unanswered questions. \nOne policeman and a pastor were killed in the crossfire.\n1 \nIn the hours and days that followed, Ram\u00edrez\u2019s wife, ex-wife, and \nbrother were arrested. His brother had US$1.8 million in his possession \nat the time of his arrest. Two weeks after the Tikal Futura shootout, \nRam\u00edrez was captured in Suchitep\u00e9quez, in southwestern Guatemala. \nAuthorities also seized weapons, SUVs, and millions of dollars. Ram\u00edrez\u2019s \nwas a landmark arrest.2 His extradition to the United States is pending. \nPrior to Ram\u00edrez\u2019s arrest, 20 years had passed since Guatemalan \nauthorities had apprehended a key player from one of its local drug \ntrafficking organizations. In 1990, Arnoldo Vargas, the mayor of the city \nof Zacapa near the Honduran border, was arrested. Two years later he \nwas extradited to the United States on drug trafficking charges. Vargas \nwas later convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison by a New York \ncourt. In the intervening years, other Guatemalans wanted on drug trafficking charges have been arrested and flown to the United States, \nbut none of these arrests took place in Guatemala.\nTen days after Ram\u00edrez\u2019s arrest, the local media released a video \ntaken hours after the September 15 shootout.  The video showed a Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 141 |police officer at the Tikal Futura Mall carrying a bag and conversing \nwith another police officer about the money it contained. No one, \nincluding the prosecutors at the scene, had registered the seizure of \nmoney.3 The video cast a pall over what had been seen as a successful \narrest and highlighted endemic police corruption. Other media reports \ncontributed to the suspicion when they reported that another police \nofficer was carrying an undisclosed, unexplained amount of U.S. dollars, \nEuros, and Guatemalan currency during the same police operation on \nSeptember 15th.\nMinister of the Interior Carlos Menocal reportedly dismissed the video \nas a fabrication. He also said that the money carried by the other police officer was no cause for alarm because the amount was insignificant. \nHowever, even before the video surfaced, a rumor had spread within \npolice circles that money had been unofficially seized at the Tikal Futura \nMall.\n4\nGuatemala City residents were still trying to come to terms with what \ntranspired on September 15 when another, equally as shocking incident occurred a month later.  Early in the morning on October 16, 2010, \narmed thugs walked into a Mexican restaurant and shot a man at point \nblank range. They also killed two women and injured eight others. The \ncrime scene was in the Zona Viva , a touristy area of the capital where \nsome of the most expensive hotels are located.\n5 \nThe shootout was a grim reminder that this is an age of insecurity for \nall Guatemalans. Violence is indiscriminate and has no regard for people or place. Victims of the October 16 attack included 28-year old Jennifer \nPrentice, who had recently received her Ph.D. at the London School \nof Economics, and 15-year old Patricia Vel\u00e1squez, who sold candy and \nchewing gum in the Zona Viva  to make a living. The survivors of the \nattack experienced what residents of countless towns and villages have \nalready lived through for years in remote, and not so remote, areas of \nrural Guatemala and in poor neighborhoods in the capital. Now violence \nwas more visible because it reached the doorstep of Guatemala\u2019s middle \nand upper classes, whose voices are more apt to be heard by politicians.\nThe events during the last four months of 2010 and the first half of \n2011 were a source of both hope and despair. In December 2010, the \ngovernment declared a two-month state of siege in the northern state of Alta Verapaz in an effort to restore governance to an area registering high Julie L\u00f3pez| 142 |drug trafficking activity. Once the state of siege was lifted in February, \nand despite many arrests and the seizure of property, drug traffickers \nresumed their activities. On March 30, 2011, the police arrested a \nprominent drug trafficker in Quetzaltenango in western Guatemala, \nJuan Alberto Ortiz L\u00f3pez, whose extradition was also requested by a \ndistrict court in Tampa, Florida, on drug trafficking charges.6 It was \nthe second landmark arrest in six months. On April 26, 2011, came a \nthird arrest, of Waldemar Lorenzana Lima, patriarch of one of the largest \nfamilies that several U.S. federal agencies had linked to drug trafficking \nin Guatemala.7 Lorenzana\u2019s extradition, still pending at the time of this \nwriting in June 2011, has also been requested by a U.S. district court in Washington, D.C. \nThe commotion caused by the Lorenzana arrest had barely died down \nwhen another tragedy struck the country. \nOn May 14, 2011, 27 peasants were murdered and decapitated on a \nranch in the Pet\u00e9n region in northern Guatemala and near the border \nwith Mexico.\n8  Local press reported that the Pet\u00e9n massacre was an act of \nretaliation against the owner of the ranch for allegedly stealing two tons \nof cocaine.  The government responded by declaring a state of siege in \nthe Pet\u00e9n.  Ten days after the peasant massacre authorities made another \ngruesome discovery, this time the dismembered body of an assistant \nprosecutor, Allan Stowlinsky Vidaurre, whose remains were found in \nCob\u00e1n, Alta Verapaz.9  A note found next to the body made it appear \nthat Stowlinsky\u2019s murder was another act of retaliation for having seized 500 kilos of cocaine earlier in the year.  In the immediate aftermath \nof the massacre and subsequent murder of the assistant prosecutor, the \ngovernment arrested several suspects and opened judicial cases that are \nstill pending.  \nEach of these recent tragedies has served to highlight the unique \nnature of organized crime in Guatemala and the weakness of the \nstate.  For example, while the arrest of Mauro Salom\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez\u2019s in \nSeptember 2010 was significant, it also highlighted that more must be done to stop corruption in the country\u2019s security forces and in some parts \nof its judicial system. Corruption is endemic and pre-dates the formal \nend of the country\u2019s armed conflict in December 1996. \nAdditionally, important aspects of the Pet\u00e9n massacre have been \nreminiscent of the mass killings during Guatemala\u2019s armed conflict Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 143 |in the early 1980s; the obvious major difference is that this time, no \nideological or political reasons were involved. Furthermore, despite the \narrest of major crime figures such as Ortiz and Lorenzana, the Pet\u00e9n \nmassacre exposed the inability of local authorities to control the spread \nof organized crime to other parts of the country.  Similarly, the murder \nof the assistant prosecutor underscored the vulnerability of justice system \nofficials in this context.\nNow, some 15 years later, Guatemala has a second chance. Three years \nsince its inception, the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG, its acronym in Spanish) can point to concrete results \nof its efforts.\n10 Guatemala is also on the verge of restructuring the role \nof the army and launching a police reform initiative that will take 13 \nyears to complete. But obstacles abound, including the lack of financial \nresources and political will to ensure the continuity of the reforms. Both \nobstacles must be overcome if Guatemala is to adopt police reform as a \nstate policy and not as a temporary reform with the lifespan of the current \npresidential administration (which will end on January 14, 2012).\nGuatemala\u2019s post-conflict period, which began in 1996, has been \nturbulent. In 1997, the National Civilian Police (PNC, in Spanish) was formed to replace the National Police, which had strong ties to \nthe military. The PNC was intended to be the state\u2019s response to both \norganized and common crime. Instead, there was a surge in both types \nof crime that overwhelmed the PNC. The gap between Guatemala\u2019s \nsecurity needs and the police\u2019s capabilities has continued to widen over \nthe last decade due to the state\u2019s failure to strengthen civilian authority \nand capacity within the PNC. \nGiven the problems with the civilian police, the reputation of the \nGuatemalan armed forces has been rehabilitated for some Guatemalans. During the armed conflict, left-wing groups, other civil society actors, \nand members of the international community condemned the atrocities \ncommitted by many members of the armed forces. Now the military is \nbeing utilized to support police efforts to rescue the country from the \nturmoil caused by organized crime.\nToday, the international community is searching for signs of a \nlong-term commitment from the Guatemalan authorities\u2014one that will survive any given administration\u2014to cleanse state institutions of \ncorruption and strengthen the armed forces so the country can participate Julie L\u00f3pez| 144 |as a capable and strong partner in the regional fight against organized \ncrime. Although donor countries view CICIG\u2019s presence in Guatemala \nas a step in the right direction, they know that it is not a magic wand. \nDonors have pressed Guatemala to invest in institutional strengthening \nand have made it clear that the continued flow of foreign assistance will \nbe conditioned on the same stipulation. \nWill Guatemala act to strengthen state institutions vital to the \nsecurity of its citizens? Only time will tell. The final year of the current administration and the first year of the incoming one will be critical. \nThis is history in the making.\nThe Nature of Organized Crime in Guatemala\nIn examining the origins of organized crime (OC) structures in \nGuatemala, it is first necessary to determine which criminal activities \nare linked to OC. \u201cOrganized crime has become a one-size-fits-all \nexplanation for what doesn\u2019t have any other apparent explanation,\u201d11 said \nRicardo Stein, who served as special advisor to the resident coordinator \nof the United Nations system in Guatemala and consultant to the \nUnited Nations Development Program (UNDP). For instance, there \nare highly-organized kidnapping and extortion networks with smaller \ninfrastructure than large-scale OC, but with the ability to engage in \nmultiple operations. These networks thrive on corruption among low \nor mid-management government officials and do not necessarily rely on \nopen cooperation from high-level government officials. Likewise, Stein \nsaid, \u201call types of OC engage in money laundering, which permeates several layers of society.\u201d\n12  \nIn September 2010, Banking System Superintendent Edgar Barqu\u00edn \nrevealed that an international OC \u201cmega structure\u201d for money laundering, operating from Guatemala, had laundered nearly Q300 million (US$37.5 \nmillion). Barqu\u00edn said that this structure had carried out operations in \nChina, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and some Caribbean and African \ncountries, using financial and commercial systems in at least four \ncountries. The laundered money was profit from trafficking in drugs, persons, and arms. It had been invested in Guatemala as purchases of \ncattle, real estate, jewelry, luxury cars, and various types of businesses.\n13  Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 145 |Guatemalan government officials have also released information \nabout how money launderers have tried to use community cooperatives \nto funnel dirty money. They have especially targeted cooperatives in \nregions along the borders where arms and drug trafficking activities are \ncommon. The Superintendent of Guatemala\u2019s Banking System maintains \nsurveillance over at least 500 cooperatives in an effort to determine \nwhether they have been used to launder money and has opened ten \ninvestigations.14 \nOther forms of organized crime that depend on government \ncorruption include the smuggling of stolen cars, people, and even stolen babies across borders for illegal adoptions.\n15 All of these smuggling \noperations involve the alteration of legal documents or the production \nof counterfeit ones. Even when government officials are not involved \nin producing counterfeit documents, corrupt officials handling falsified \ndocuments may recognize them as such and still process them as valid \nlegal documents, for a fee.\nThe disappearance of babies and teenagers is linked to illegal adoption \nand human trafficking networks. Press reports quote the Guatemalan National Commission for Adoptions revealing that there were three \ncases of babies stolen in 2006 and given up for adoption to families in \nthe United States in 2007 and 2008. The Guatemala-based Fundaci\u00f3n \nSobrevivientes  (Survivors Foundation) has taken these cases to court. \nAccording to Norma Cruz, the foundation\u2019s director, one judge and three officials from a state agency in charge of overseeing adoption \nprocesses were prosecuted.\n16 \nThe problem is widespread. In September and October 2010 alone, \nAlba-Keneth Alerts\u2014similar to the Amber Alert in the United States\u2014were issued on behalf of 30 children who had been reported missing. \nMost of the children were found within three days. Some were rescued \nfrom brothels.\n17  In an interview, Minister of Interior Carlos Menocal said \nthat adolescent and adult victims kidnapped in other Central American \ncountries are illegally transported to Guatemala, a transit point on the \nway to Mexico and the United States.18 \nFundaci\u00f3n Sobrevivientes has documented cases in which victims \nkidnapped in Guatemala were kept inside the country but later moved to different areas from where the abduction took place. All of these \nactivities involve corruption and negligence by judicial system officials Julie L\u00f3pez| 146 |who aid in smuggling victims across national borders and overlook the \nuse of counterfeit or altered documents. \nThe cases of the 30 children reported missing between September \nand October did not reveal involvement by corrupt government \nofficials. However, the \u201cAnnual Trafficking in Persons Report 2010\u201d \npublished by the U.S. Department of State indicates that the Guatemalan \ngovernment has not complied with the minimum standards to eliminate \nhuman trafficking. These standards are part of the U.S. government\u2019s anti-human trafficking policy worldwide.\n19 The 2010 report stated that, \nalthough the Guatemalan government had taken significant steps to \ntarget the problem of trafficking, efforts to fight official complicity in \ntrafficking have been insufficient, and most victims are still receiving \ninadequate treatment.20\nThere is a vicious cycle in which corruption both enables OC and \nguarantees impunity, and vice-versa. Political analyst Ricardo Stein described the cycle as follows: \u201cCorruption\u2014in the government\u2014\nfavors OC, and OC has used corruption for its purposes.\u201d He added \na cautionary note: \u201cineptitude also can pass as corruption, and doesn\u2019t \nnecessarily mean OC is involved. Also, pushing forward certain issues \nfor personal gain, for a price, is not necessarily OC.\u201d\n21 \nOC is capable of gathering intelligence about its targets and possible \nbusiness partners. Intelligence information enables OC to operate more \neffectively and decide which government officials to approach and how. \nOC will recruit, extort, infiltrate, or\u2014as a last resort\u2014 threaten an \nintended target.22\nCriminal organizations adopt different strategies with regard to \nterritorial control, also an important factor for OC. Historically, each \ncrime lord controlled his own territory and\u2014to a greater or lesser \ndegree\u2014local government structures and specific routes within that \nterritory. If a criminal is arrested within the territory or along the route, \nthe crime lord exerts his influence with local authorities to secure his or \nher release. This also happens at a regional level.23\nExclusive control of a territory is no longer the only strategy. Today, \nroutes controlled by different organizations sometimes pass through the same territory. At times, the organizations reach an understanding to \nrespect each other\u2019s routes, but in other instances, one organization will \ntry to take over a route previously controlled by a rival.Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 147 |Criminal organizations that specialize in drug or arms trafficking, \nand control territories or specific routes, can also profit from other \ntrafficking activities. Any other criminal organization moving its illegal \nmerchandise across the territory, or over the route, must pay a \u201ctoll\u201d to \nthe controlling criminal organization or face brutal reprisals. In mid-\n2010, 73 primarily Central American migrants were kidnapped while \nbeing smuggled across Mexico without the Zetas\u2019 permission.24 The \nsmugglers escaped, but the migrants were less fortunate. The Zetas demanded ransom from their families in Central America, and when \nthe families were unable to pay the ransom, the migrants were killed.\n25 \nThe Genesis of Corrupt and Criminal Structures\nOrganized crime in Guatemala is not a mutation of previous military regimes but rather resembles a three-legged stool. Local capos,  or heads of \nhomegrown criminal structures, are the first and largest leg. The second leg consists of foreign OC groups that seek to ally themselves with a local \ncapo, to obtain permission to operate in his territory or along his route. \nThe third leg is comprised of corrupt government officials\u2014both within Guatemala and in other countries\u2014who actively work with OC.\n26\nThe origins of OC are found in homegrown criminal networks \nthat stem from the capo \u2019s engagement in local illegal activities. These \nactivities can extend to broader national and/or transnational networks \nof smugglers or traffickers. OC has existed in Guatemala since at least \nthe 1960s, active in theft, bank robbery, extortion, and kidnapping. \nLocal capos have amassed great fortunes and created powerful criminal \nstructures. These structures adapt to market forces and to the particular activities in which a capo  is engaged at any point in time.\nIn Guatemala, foreign OC groups used what political analyst H\u00e9ctor \nRosada called \u201chistoric operators.\u201d These individuals were immersed in a web of powerful criminal structures with roots in the army.  These \noperators emerged after 1933 and the end of prohibition in the United \nStates, carrying out their activities primarily between 1942 and 1946.  \nTheir activities led to an increase in drug trafficking in Mexico which, \nin turn, led to the spread of drug trafficking across its southern border \ninto Guatemala. Following the revolution of 1944, Guatemala made a Julie L\u00f3pez| 148 |transition from military dictatorship to a joint civil-military government.  \nThese lasted until the 1954 military coup backed by the United States, \nwhich ushered in a new era of military regimes. According to Rosada, \nthe historic operators re-engaged in organized criminal activities from \n1954 until after 1996.27 \nGuatemala\u2019s first visible civilian capo, Arnoldo Vargas, didn\u2019t surface \nuntil the 1980s. Some press reports indicate that he was a member of a \ndeath squad beginning in the mid-1960s and during the 1970s. Other \nunofficial reports identify Vargas as a former customs official who, after \nbeing fired, went into the cattle business and into politics, becoming \nmayor of Zacapa. After the 1985 election, the armed forces had handed \npresidential power over to civilians. Vargas\u2019 emergence was due, in part, to the military\u2019s withdrawal from civilian affairs.\nAs mayor of Zacapa, Vargas served as a connection between the \ncriminal and the political worlds. His criminal structure became the \nmeans by which Colombian criminal networks transferred cocaine \noverland through Guatemala. Vargas was arrested in 1990 and extradited \nto the United States in 1992, despite allegations that his legal right \nto a pre-trial hearing as a public official was violated and that he was prosecuted on false grounds.\nVargas had dealt mostly with the Medell\u00edn and Cali cartels and \nfostered good relations with military officials in Zacapa. \u201cVargas was \na hero to many army officials who were assigned to Zacapa at the \ntime,\u201d said retired Colonel Mario M\u00e9rida, former director of military \nintelligence. \u201cHe\u2019d arrive at the Esquipulas garrison [in Chiquimula, \nneighboring Zacapa,] and invite officers to lunch.\u201d Bottles of whiskey \noften accompanied the meal, and he would insist on giving them \nspending money. \u201cThat\u2019s how he bought many people,\u201d said M\u00e9rida.\n28 \nVargas\u2019 tactics help explain how he was able to arrange for flights of \ncocaine-laden small airplanes originating in South America to land at \nthe Zacapa military base.29 \nIn contrast to the situation in Mexico, where most of the corrupt \ngovernment officials were either police or municipal-level authorities, in Guatemala during the 1980s, the majority of those comprising the \nthird leg of the OC stool were members of the armed forces, due to \nthe military\u2019s preeminence within the state. The Guatemalan army \ncontrolled 100 percent of the territory from 1954 until 1996, and Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 149 |exercised control over communications, the road system, airports and \nsea ports. Criminal activity was impossible without the armed forces\u2019 \nknowledge, according to Rosada.30\nThe Colombian cartels\u2019 territorial advances in Guatemala began in \nthe 1980s. The army detected small airplanes landing in the southwest and southern Guatemalan coast,\n31 and thought the flights were supplying \nthe guerrillas. However, this initial assumption was questioned when there was no concurrent increase in the insurgency\u2019s combat capabilities. \nAfter a careful examination of the flight routes, the army realized that \nthe flights were landing in areas where the guerrillas were not active, \nand that several military officers assigned to these posts were showing \nsigns of improvement in their quality of life.\n32\nPrior to the Vargas connection, Colombian cartels had been trafficking \ndrugs by sea\u2014mostly through military connections on Guatemala\u2019s Pacific coast\u2014using go-fast boats.  Problems developed when different \nColombian criminal groups began stealing one another\u2019s shipments along \nthe Nicaraguan and Costa Rican coasts. Some responded by moving \ntheir operations to land and air transportation.\nAt first, the Colombians had difficulty establishing a foothold in \nGuatemala. Their planes bombarded ranches with packaged cocaine, but no one picked them up except to toss them outside their property. \n\u201cOnce, in a meeting held by the military high command in the early \n\u201890s, I was shown some pictures,\u201d recalled Rosada. \u201cSeveral officers were \nthere, including the Minister of Defense Domingo Garc\u00eda Samayoa and \n[2011 presidential candidate and retired General] Otto P\u00e9rez Molina.\n33 I \nwas asked if I knew what the pictures were showing. They were images of \nseveral packages strewn by the side of a road. [When I saw them, I thought \nthat] if the military were asking a civilian\u2014me\u2014what these packages \nwere, it was because they did not understand what was going on.\u201d34\nWhen dropping the cocaine packages from the air did not work, the \nColombians began visiting farm owners with the intention of renting farmers\u2019 properties that had landing strips. However, they did not \ncontact just any farm owner; they targeted those who had losses or a bad \nharvest. The Colombians were running a business and had conducted \ntheir marketing studies beforehand. Rosada recounted, \u201cin a meeting \nwith the military, one of these farmers\u2014whose son-in-law was an army \nofficer\u2014said the Colombians asked him to set a price [for renting the Julie L\u00f3pez| 150 |landing strip] and asked them for US$50,000 per year, far more than the \nQ50,000 (approximately US$8,900 given the average exchange rate in \n1993) he had earned for his harvest. The farmer said they accepted and, \nby way of explanation added, \u2018I could tell that something was wrong, \nbut you know what it\u2019s like to need money really badly, don\u2019t you?\u2019\u201d \nIn return for the money, the farmer only had to instruct his workers to \nleave the property before the renter\u2019s workers arrived. \u201cThe farmer said, \n\u2018you see? It was hassle-free because we were not involved in anything,\u2019\u201d Rosada recalled.\nThe following year, the Colombians told the farmer, \u201clook, we didn\u2019t \ndo as well as we thought, so here is US$35,000 in cash and US$15,000 \nin product.\u201d The product was cocaine. The Guatemalan farmers thought \nthey could establish an internal market, but most would simply get rid \nof the \u201cproduct.\u201d Others tried to market it or found someone else to \ndo it for them. According to Rosada, the army estimated that at least 100 landing strips were being rented in the 1980s. He also believed that \nColombian traffickers bought properties in Guatemala to build resorts \nthat doubled as contact-generating points where they began befriending \nmilitary officers in the way that Vargas had done.  Thus the spider web \nbegan to grow.\n35\nThe surge in Colombian involvement can be traced to the period \nfrom 1986 to 1988. The military high command ( Estado Mayor de la \nDefensa ) concluded that increased openness and flexibility during the \nprevious military government of General Humberto Mej\u00eda V\u00edctores \n(1983-1986) left an opening that drug traffickers exploited.36 In the \n1980s, OC in Guatemala was largely taken over by Colombian cartels; they used local capos  to approach top-level officials indirectly, or went \ndirectly to the military. By the end of the decade, the Colombians were joined by Mexican criminal organizations that made their appearance \nin the region by approaching and involving low-ranking Guatemalan \ngovernment officials in their activities.\nWhen Vargas was arrested in 1990, Byron Berganza, was regarded \nby Guatemalan police as Vargas\u2019s successor and the country\u2019s main drug trafficker. Berganza, a former military commander, had begun \ntrafficking and was known as the most powerful figure in northeastern \nGuatemala. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) traces his \nearliest activities back to 1988.\n37 Berganza dealt with both Colombian Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 151 |and Mexican drug traffickers and enjoyed the protection or complicity \nof several military officers. Meanwhile, the profile of transnational drug \ntrafficking networks in Guatemala had begun to change.\nWhile Colombia\u2019s Cali Cartel stepped up efforts to establish a foothold \nin Guatemala between 1991 and 1992, a six-month military operation \nsupported by U.S. forces spoiled the Colombians\u2019 intentions, leading to \nthe disintegration of most of their criminal structure, and significantly \nreducing the cartel\u2019s presence in the country. The impact of the operation was less dramatic on other Colombian criminal organizations. \nColonel M\u00e9rida, director of military intelligence at that time, revealed \nthat police did not participate in the operation because they were not \ntrusted.\n38 The extradition to the United States of Vargas, whose 1990 \narrest was prompted by a Colombian DEA informant, occurred towards the end of this operation in 1992.\nOne year later, in 1993, President Jorge Serrano El\u00edas declared \na coup by suppressing constitutional guarantees and attempting to \noverride the authority of the legislative and judicial branches. He was \nousted by popular demand by a wide array of civil society groups and \nthe military.\n39 Ramiro De Le\u00f3n Carpio replaced Serrano after the coup \nfailed. This political transition also resulted in changes in the military \nhigh command.\nBy the mid-1990s, with their leaders dead or under arrest, Colombia\u2019s \nMedellin and Cali cartels had been largely dismantled.40 In the meantime, \nBerganza\u2019s profile had risen and his security detail was comprised exclusively of military officials. \u201cAt the time, not a single shipment \nof cocaine was moved in the country without his consent,\u201d said one \nformer police investigator. There were captains and majors protecting \nBerganza\u2019s every move when the former detective was one of the police \nofficers who unsuccessfully tried to arrest him in 1997.\n41 \n\u201cThe arrest warrant was for a swindling case; [Berganza] said it was \nno problem, called his lawyer, and asked him to fix everything with the \njudge in Villa Nueva (a province adjoining Guatemala City), and we all \ndrove there in a caravan, his military bodyguards leading the way and \nescorting us in several cars,\u201d the former police investigator recalled. \u201cWe \nhad to wait for the judge. It was lunch time, and we said we hadn\u2019t eaten \nall day, so Berganza gave us money to buy lunch. I bought fried chicken for everyone. When was the police ever going to give us money to buy Julie L\u00f3pez| 152 |lunch? Never! He was an OK guy. After arriving, the judge declared that \nthe arrest warrant was unjustified and released Berganza.\u201d42\nIn court papers, the DEA identified Berganza as an unpaid informant. \nBerganza explained that he cooperated with the DEA agents after they \ncontacted him and promised to withdraw a 1996 indictment against him \nfrom a New York court\u2014a promise that the DEA denied. Berganza was \nallegedly the go-between for the Colombian and Mexican organizations, \nand sometimes passed information and phone numbers of their members \nto the DEA. Berganza also gave the DEA the money and drugs he \ncollected. At the same time, he continued trafficking. In the late 1990s, he dealt with Nicaraguan military officers, and his main accomplice was \na Guatemalan customs official that became a DEA informant and was \nkilled years later. New York prosecutor Anirudh Bansal told the court, \nreferring to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, \u201cas far as we knew, [Berganza] \nwas a drug trafficker.\u201d\n43\nThe decreased Colombian presence in Guatemala left territory \navailable for the Mexicans to expand their operations in the country. \nThis was evidenced by the presence of the head of the Sinaloa Cartel, \nJoaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, and his subsequent arrest in Guatemala \nin 1993. Guzm\u00e1n was later extradited and jailed in Mexico, where \nhe escaped in 2000. The shift from a predominately Colombian \nparticipation in drug trafficking through Guatemala to an increased \nMexican presence began in the late 1990s and continued into the following decade. Yet, despite this change and law enforcement \noperations against the Cali Cartel in Guatemala and the Cartel\u2019s \ndownfall in Colombia in the mid-1990s, \u201cthe Colombians flourished \nmost in 1994 and during the Ramiro De Le\u00f3n Carpio government \n[mid 1993-January 1996], until 1997,\u201d according to Rosada. \nThe Mexicans operated to the north of San Marcos (along the southern \nMexican border) and smuggled marijuana, while the Colombians dealt \nin cocaine on the southern coast and along Guatemala\u2019s eastern border. \nConfrontation between Colombian and Mexican cartels began at the end of Guatemala\u2019s armed conflict in 1996, when several military bases \nwere closed around the country (starting in the late 1990s up until 2004) \nand Mexicans began to intervene in the cocaine trafficking market in \nGuatemala.\n44Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 153 |During this time, the Mexicans made contact with the younger \nmembers of the Mendoza family in Izabal and Pet\u00e9n in northeastern \nGuatemala, the Lorenzanas45 in Zacapa, Jorge Mario \u201cEl Gordo\u201d Paredes \n(arrested in May 2008 in Honduras), and Otoniel Turcios Marroqu\u00edn, an alleged accomplice of Paredes (arrested in October 2010 in Belize). \n\u201cThey became the cornerstone for foreign OC structures,\u201d said Rosada. \n\u201cOutsiders, [the Mexicans], had an intelligent modus operandi because \nthey didn\u2019t compete with local crime; they stimulated it.\u201d \nBy the early 2000s, Berganza had begun to lose power.  He \nsurvived two assassination attempts, allegedly at the behest of either the Colombians or the Mexicans, who had discovered that he was talking to \nthe DEA. On September 10, 2003, he was arrested by local police officers \nin El Salvador for not possessing a permit to cross the Guatemala-El \nSalvador border. Salvadoran police subsequently handed him over to \nDEA agents stationed in El Salvador.\n46 Berganza was \u201cexpelled\u201d from \nthat country according to documents in the Southern District Court of \nNew York. On September 11, 2003, he was flown from El Salvador to \nNew York and charged with conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine \nin the US. He pleaded guilty and, in April 2008, was sentenced to 22 \nyears\u2019 imprisonment. \nIn the 1980s, foreign organized crime networks\u2014like those of \nthe Colombians and, later on, those of the Mexicans\u2014selectively and carefully cast their net over politicians like Vargas, the mayor of \nZacapa. To set up operations in Guatemala they chose to work with a \nGuatemalan criminal structure that was already established. \u201cOC cannot \nsurvive in a void, cannot work without a structure to latch on to, just \nlike contraband requires customs officials,\u201d said Rosada. \u201cIt\u2019s like a vine \nthat requires something to climb on, or it cannot grow.\u201d\n47\nArmed Conflict Shields Organized Crime\nThree elements must be weighed when considering the involvement of \nGuatemalan military officials with OC: 1) during the armed conflict, \nchanges were made in military personnel that sometimes favored OC, \nindirectly and unintentionally; 2) the army\u2019s involvement in OC was \nnot the result of institutional orders from the military high command, Julie L\u00f3pez| 154 |but resulted from a climate of permissiveness or corruption in certain \nmilitary structures that permeated all ranks from top to bottom. For \nexample, criminal camaraderie developed among graduates of particular \nclasses of the military academy; and 3) OC is not a by-product of the \nmilitary or a mutation established by military officials who disappeared \nwithout a trace (and were not reported missing or kidnapped), nor is \nit a consequence of armed conflict. Nevertheless, the end of the armed \nconflict became an indirect accelerant of the OC surge after the signing of the Peace Accords.\n\u201cIt is ill-intentioned to convey the idea that OC is a mutation from \nthe military,\u201d said Rosada. \u201cMy own view, when asked about the level \nof army complicity in drug trafficking, is to respond that it was not easy \nto buy the military. On the contrary, they [drug traffickers] had to insert \na mole within the military structure, an infiltrator. They protected him \nand tried to get him promoted, so that, when his help was needed, he was in the right place to facilitate a series of processes.\u201d\n48\nBetween 1981 and 1982, a total of 16 or 17 tactical unit commanders \n(second lieutenants) were killed in combat. Given these losses, the \nmilitary academy accelerated the training of some 200 officers and \nadvanced their graduation dates\u2014sometimes losing quality control in \nthe process. The same applied to the massive training of troops to replace \nthe dead and injured.49\nSecond lieutenants enjoyed the full and direct support of the \ndefense minister because they were the link between the troops and \nthe military high-command. They were crucial in war and viewed as \nauthority figures by troops; they represented power at an institutional \nlevel. \u201cSeveral officers began to get involved in illegal activities on their \nown, not at an institutional level,\u201d M\u00e9rida said. \u201cSome were caught and \narrested, like Lt. Colonel [Carlos] Ochoa.50 Others were not because \nthey knew how to do things.\u201d51 Perhaps some of them were the moles \nreferred to by Rosada.\nMoreover, as the process for training troops was expedited to meet \ncombat demands, background checks (including examination of one\u2019s financial situation) for personnel were relaxed\u2014 a sign that military \nintelligence\u2019s influence had diminished in that respect.\n52 \nAdditionally, Rosada believes that corruption went beyond troops \nand second lieutenants. It was part of a web of illegal activities that cut Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 155 |across several command structures. \u201cIf there was a corrupt general, he \nneeded several corrupt colonels, and they needed some corrupt lieutenant \ncolonels, and they needed corrupt majors, who in turn required \ncorrupt captains and corrupt second captains, who also needed corrupt \nlieutenants, and these, in turn, needed corrupt second lieutenants, and \neverybody from the corrupt captains to the corrupt second lieutenants \nneeded corrupt troops,\u201d the analyst explained. \u201cThere is no room for \nconfusion. The military high-command knew perfectly well who was doing what: theft of gasoline tankers, contraband, kidnapping, cattle \ntheft, etc.\u201d\n53\nDuring the armed conflict, customs and immigration officials at \ncheckpoints along the border and at seaports gathered information that was crucial to counterinsurgency efforts. The border checkpoints \nbetween Guatemala and Mexico, at El Carmen and Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n, were \nfocal points for scrutiny and control because the guerrillas (URNG) \nhad a strategic stronghold on the Mexican side of the border in that \narea. The Agua Caliente border with Honduras was also strategic. As \na result, military intelligence relied on police officers and immigration and customs officials assigned to the area, according to M\u00e9rida. He \nexpressed that recruiting informants at the border was a \u201clegitimate \nobjective\u201d for the Guatemalan military because it furthered its efforts to \ngather first-hand information, generate intelligence, and determine the \nmagnitude of the insurgency threat. \u201cAt some point, the whole process \ngot perverted with the engagement of certain individuals in corruption; \ncontraband was allowed, and those positions became strategic for drug trafficking,\u201d said the retired colonel.\n54 Vargas was only one example. He \nwent from customs official to mayor to top drug trafficker.\nIn 1996, military tribunals were dismantled. This eliminated military \ncomplicity in the acquittal of guilty officers, although the protection \noffered by the military tribunals was replaced by corruption amongst \ncivilian officials. For example, if an officer was found innocent of \na misdemeanor or a crime in a military tribunal, he could still be \nsanctioned or given a dishonorable discharge by the minister of defense. \u201cThe Military Tribunal was concerned with safeguarding the prestige \nof the armed forces, as if the prestige were that good,\u201d M\u00e9rida said. Julie L\u00f3pez| 156 |In civilian courts, this did not happen. Military officers could defend \nthemselves, but a number of them were still sent to jail.55 \nOn another front, evidence of longstanding ties between the military \nand the police was uncovered in 2005, when an investigator from the Human Rights Ombudsman\u2019s office stumbled upon a treasure trove \nof historical records at the archives of the National Police. While \ninvestigating an explosion at a military base, the staff person discovered \nan abandoned warehouse\u2014next to a junkyard on PNC property\u2014that \ncontained millions of police records. \nThe records contain invaluable information dating from the early \n1900s, regarding hundreds of thousands of arrests and the fate of people who were forcibly disappeared in the 1970s and 1980s. \u201cThat archive \nsuggests that the National Police had dozens of thousands of informants. \nIntelligence information in Guatemala is not based on technology, \nbut on the massive use of informants,\u201d said Gustavo Porras, President \n\u00c1lvaro Arz\u00fa\u2019s private secretary (1996-2000).\n56 The army had expertise \nin creating a network of informants for counterinsurgency purposes and, \nlater, for criminal ones. This capacity was also transferred to the police.\n\u201cThe police executed the orders received, but the orders came from \nabove,\u201d said Porras.57 The orders came from the military, in a context of \ncounterinsurgency and state-sponsored terrorism. \nAccording to Rosada, the military was the main power structure \nin Guatemala between 1954 and 1996. He reached the conclusion that \u201cany decision made was known by them, and there was no decision \ntaken against their will.\u201d\n58 These decisions pertained to security in \nparticular, whether involving the guerrilla or OC. In 2010, Carlos \nCastresana, former CICIG commissioner, said that \u201cwhat used to be \ncounterinsurgency is now organized crime.\u201d59\nBy 1996, when the peace accords were signed, OC had tainted \na considerable number of military officers. Shortly thereafter, they \nwere discharged without a proper demobilization process to integrate \nthem into civilian society. Some of the discharged military officers \nkept their \u201cinside\u201d contacts (civilian and/or military) in state \ninstitutions. At the same time, both organized and common crime \nbecame more prevalent throughout the country partly because the \narmy\u2019s nationwide surveillance structure was significantly diminished when the PNC was created.Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 157 |The Haunting Failure to Dismantle the Clandestine \nState Intelligence Apparatus\nIn Guatemala, clandestine intelligence and security structures (known as \nCIACS in Spanish) are protected by people embedded in state institutions \nand security forces. The CIACS enjoy impunity because of their direct or indirect ties to the state. The CICIG established that the CIACS \nwere not dismantled after the 1996 signing of the peace accords. They continued to operate, both to respond to state interests and to profit from \nillegal activities, entering into a \u201cpartnership with transnational groups \nof organized crime.\u201d\n60\nIn an interview, human rights campaigner Helen Mack, head of the \nGuatemalan government\u2019s Police Reform Commission, asserted that \nmany public officials in strategic positions of power, handling large \nvolumes of information, had corrupt and/or criminal networks in place \nbefore the armed conflict ended.61 In the post-conflict era, OC fueled \ncorruption within the state. Over time, OC gained control of certain public offices and used them to protect and further its interests.\nTo believe that the CIACS were the source of OC is a mistake, \n\u201cparticularly in a country that has such a lax and discretional justice \nsystem,\u201d said Ricardo Stein.\n62 In fact, one section in the armed forces \ncreated the CIACS to gather intelligence for counterinsurgency \npurposes. Then, some of the CIACS engaged in criminal activities, and \nacquired a life of their own\u2014parallel to or in complicity with OC\u2014\nbefore the formal end of the armed conflict in Guatemala.\n\u201cSomething that greatly concerned guerrilla commanders was the \nexistence of military commando units comprised of men who posed \nas guerrillas and infiltrated the insurgency\u2019s structures,\u201d said Stein. \u201cAt some point these units [specializing in infiltration of the guerrillas] were \nlinked to military intelligence, but they apparently disappeared without \na trace between 1980 and 1985.\u201d\nGuerrilla commanders worried that part of the military units that \ninfiltrated the insurgency, by posing as guerrillas, had turned into \nCIACS. None of them had taken part in the formal demobilization \nprocess. There was also concern that some extortions and kidnappings attributed to the guerrillas were actually carried out by members \nfrom these units.\n63 These concerns notwithstanding, there was ample Julie L\u00f3pez| 158 |evidence that the insurgency was engaged in extortion and kidnapping \nfor financial gain well before 1997.64 However, it is difficult to determine \nwhether former guerrilla members are involved in OC today because the \ninsurgency did not keep records of its membership. This is not the case \nwith OC members who served in the armed forces, because the military \nkeep meticulous records of all those who work for the institution.65\nPresident \u00c1lvaro Colom, who participated in the peace process as \nhead of the National Peace Fund (Fonapaz, in Spanish) during the first two years of the Arz\u00fa government, offered assurances that no links were \ndetected between the insurgency and OC financing.\n66 Mack observed \nthat the guerrillas had not occupied positions of power within the state \nstructure since the peace accords were signed; they have only attained \nmarginal positions with no capacity or ability to influence anything\u2014\nunlike the military.67 \nNevertheless, the army did not demobilize like the guerrillas, \naccording to retired Colonel M\u00e9rida. \u201cThe army never generated a policy \nthat I would call \u2018return to life at the base,\u2019 which should have been \noriented to readopting values and principles and mainly to demanding \nmore academic development from officers, because the conflict had \nended,\u201d said M\u00e9rida. \u201cThis would have allowed [military] reinsertion \nand participation within [civilian] society.\u201d68\nFormer combatants who served in the army struggled to make a \nliving when they returned home after the armed conflict ended. There \nwere no provisions in the Peace Accords to assist them. Neither the state \nactors (Executive officials and military) nor the guerrilla commanders \nincluded such provisions in the peace negotiations. After the conflict \nended in 1996, soldiers returning to civilian life without much formal \neducation and with few job skills found very few opportunities. Close \nto 11,663 soldiers, from generals (receiving severance payments of nearly US $56,000) to foot soldiers were forced to retire, leaving a force-\nstrength of 15,500.\n69\nThe army\u2019s meticulous records allowed for the identification of \nseveral military officers involved in OC four months before the signing of the peace accords. In September 1996, the Arz\u00fa government took \ndown a contraband network operating within the state-run customs \nagency (Direcci\u00f3n General de Aduanas), which had a large structure \ninvolving at least 20 military officers. The network\u2019s leader, Alfredo Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 159 |Moreno, was arrested. During the investigation of this case, many of \nthe officers allegedly implicated were discharged from the military but \nwere not prosecuted. Some were suspected of involvement in illegal \nactivities during the conflict, as well as throughout the peace process and \nafterwards.\nThe Vargas, Berganza, and Moreno cases provide ample evidence of \nthe military\u2019s involvement in OC in the late 1980s and 1990s, while the \narmed conflict was still in full swing. Therefore, the absence of military demobilization alone at the end of the armed conflict does not explain \nthe military\u2019s participation in OC. Further evidence is provided by the \nrecruitment of Guatemalan military Special Forces known as the Kaibil  \nby Mexican organized crime (particularly the Zetas) beginning in 1994, two years before the end of the war.\n70 This recruitment may have been \nsuccessful because some of these officers knew that their employment \nwould end with the signing of the Peace Accords.71 Others simply may \nhave seen OC as a more profitable sideline than serving in the armed forces, which provided tainted military officers a legal fa\u00e7ade for illegal \nactivity.\nRosada explained that, for the military, the end of the armed conflict \ndid not mean yielding control; some members of the armed forces \nretired while other continued to hold government posts. It is certainly \nnot the case that military officers holding strategic positions within the government after their retirement from the army are involved in \ncorruption or OC.  For some, however, the positions they hold enable \nthem to connect with local criminal networks and use state resources for \ncriminal endeavors. Others engage in corrupt practices and profit from \nthese resources without necessarily being linked to OC.\n72\nThere are two dominant perspectives in Guatemala regarding the \nmilitary\u2019s institutional sanctioning of involvement by its personnel in \nOC: (1) there is no institutional sanction; (2) the involvement of army \npersonnel assumes institutional sanction, as each soldier represents the \nentire institution.\nRosada maintained that, \u201cto talk about the military institution is to \ntalk about all its human resources and the structural hierarchy inside the \ninstitution. \u2026  Therefore, the military\u2019s high command is responsible, but not the young officers, or the officers in between. Some officers Julie L\u00f3pez| 160 |within the military structure did not attain senior positions within the \nhigh command because they knew that doing so meant stepping into \nthe mafia. For some, reaching the position of minister involved paying \ndues.\u201d Rosada believes that the military must assume institutional \nresponsibility because the law covers the institution as a whole, \nalthough there are vast internal differences among military personnel. \nSome officers strictly abide by the law while others use their positions \nof authority for criminal purposes.73\nThere are also differences among the classes that graduate from the \nmilitary academy. Some have more leadership skills. Some are more \nprone to involvement in OC. Rosada pointed out that the roots of some \ncriminal groups can be traced back to the academy\u2019s Class of 1973. For \nexample, while retired General Otto P\u00e9rez Molina is a notable exception \nof a military officer who is not identified with any of these structures, \nhis peers\u2014Juan de Dios Estrada Vel\u00e1squez, Rony Macloni Mor\u00e1n, and \nEduardo Ar\u00e9valo Lacs\u2014all ministers of Defense during the Alfonso Portillo administration (2000-2004), are a different matter. The Public \nMinistry (prosecutor) and the CICIG claimed that the four men were \ninvolved in the looting of Q906 million (US$113 million) in state \nfunds while in office.\n74 However, only Portillo, Ar\u00e9valo and Manuel \nMaza (Portillo\u2019s former minister of Finance, also indicted) stood trial for the illegal use of a small portion of that amount (Q120 million, or \nUS$15 million) about which there was stronger evidence.  Yet they were \nacquitted in 2011.\n75\nAnother example of camaraderie among graduates of the same class \nis the case of Juan Jos\u00e9 Le\u00f3n, also known as Juancho , killed in Zacapa \nby the Zetas in March 2008 in a drug-related dispute. According \nto M\u00e9rida, Le\u00f3n graduated from the Instituto Adolfo Hall military \nacademy in Zacapa, and managed to make a series of contacts with \nseveral officers during his time at the academy.76 The assumption is that \nhe used these contacts for criminal purposes years after he graduated \nfrom the military academy.\n\u201cAt some point, criminal structures seek a marriage of political \nand economic structures,\u201d Rosada explained. Those involved in these \nstructures search for and secure contacts in the political sector, within \nthe government, and in areas of the state where they can have access to \nlarge sums of money. Minister of Interior Carlos Menocal has identified Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 161 |former President Portillo as the political component in the OC networks. \nPortillo\u2019s close advisors, Colonel Jacobo Sal\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez (convicted in \n2010) and Major Napole\u00f3n Rojas, are under investigation by the CICIG \nand were accused of direct involvement in illegal procurement scandals \nworth millions of dollars and involving the Ministry of Defense during \nthe Portillo administration.77  According to Rosada, these types of \ncriminal structures also search for contacts at a local level\u2014lawyers, \njudges, prosecutors\u2014to guarantee their ability to operate quietly.  \nPortillo was the political contact; his close advisors and the Minister of \nDefense were the links to the money.\nEarly in 2010, CICIG director Castresana recognized that the \nCIACS were made up of several groups. He noticed \u201can evolution\u201d \nin their composition and objectives. He observed that these groups\u2014in combination with OC\u2014had \u201cshot up everywhere.\u201d\n78 Some civil \nsociety actors were also trying to identify the CIACS by asking some \nfundamental questions. \u201cWhat did the CIACS mutate into?  [Are they] \ninside or outside the state?  And how do you turn them off?\u201d asked \nRicardo Stein. \u201cThe CICIG\u2019s task now is to expose and call these \nstructures by their name, and dismantle them. That\u2019s the archeological \npart of the process, because the CICIG will find snake skin. Then, it has \nto see what the snake looks like now, without the old skin.\u201d79\nIdentifying these structures was just as difficult between 1996 and \n2000. \u201c\u2018Why do you think that these structures weren\u2019t dismantled?\u2019 \nI asked [human rights activist] Helen Mack back then,\u201d said Porras, \nreferring to their conversation 16 years ago. \u201cThen I said, \u2018Introduce them \nto me;\u2019 we don\u2019t know who they are.\u201d Porras maintains that, during the \nperiod immediately after the signing of the Peace Accords, clandestine \nstructures operated at the margins of the state, not as a part of it, and \nthat there is only testimonial evidence against them.80 As an example, he \nsays that despite the many accusations against General Francisco Ortega \nMenaldo as the purported head of these networks, no hard evidence has \nbeen produced against him. Ortega Menaldo was also connected to the \nPortillo government and unofficially linked to clandestine intelligence \nnetworks and organized crime, but never prosecuted and taken to trial.\nPorras says that the CICIG is struggling to reach the heart of a \nGordian knot. \u201cThis is a qualitative investigation,\u201d he points out. \u201cTheir main objective is not something very vast; it\u2019s very complex.\u201d\n81Julie L\u00f3pez| 162 |The Signing of the Peace Accords Changes Dynamics of \nCriminal Networks\nPrior to the signing of the peace accords in January 1996, President Arz\u00fa \ndismissed from the Guatemalan military 13 generals who had led the \nnotorious counterinsurgency campaigns. Some believe this action was a political concession in negotiations with the guerrillas.\n82 Other analysts \npoint out that several of the retired generals continued to direct criminal networks because they kept their political and military connections, \noffering further evidence that organized crime is not a post-war \nproduct.\n83\nSubsequent to the peace accords, the army\u2019s presence in the country \nand its force size were reduced with the understanding that the soon-to-be-created PNC would replace military surveillance. The accords \nprovided for a new role for the police, which would strengthen civilian \nauthority. Several constitutional reforms were needed to help accomplish \nthis. Approval of the reforms required passage of a public referendum. \nOf the 47 proposed constitutional changes included in the referendum \nonly 13 stemmed from the peace accords. One recent report from the International Crisis Group indicated that \u201cvoters rejected the package\u201d \nduring the May 1999 referendum (with only 18.5 per cent participation) \nand thus slowed down compliance with the Accord for Strengthening \nCivilian Authority, necessary to ensure greater civilian control of public \nsecurity.\n 84  \nThe referendum was destined to fail before it began because the public \ninformation campaign about the reforms was limited in scope and depth. Ignorance about the purpose of the referendum was so widespread that \nin some towns in the highlands of Quich\u00e9, in northwestern Guatemala, \nsome voters were puzzled because there were no party logos or faces of \ncandidates on the ballot. They thought they were standing in line for \nan election of some sort. Press accounts documented the confusion. In addition, the referendum ballot had complex questions and legal terms \nthat the average Guatemalan did not understand. As a result, most voters \nopted to vote \u201cno\u201d or to annul their vote.\n85\nIn the meantime, the police were undergoing reform. New recruits \nwere trained within six months. Officers from the old National Police \nwere \u201crecycled\u201d with three-month training sessions and could work Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 163 |for the PNC if they passed the required tests and background checks. \nHowever, two years into the new training process, the Washington \nOffice on Latin America (WOLA) issued a report whose main conclusion \nwas that the PNC Academy was sacrificing quality for quantity, to try \nto meet the commitment of having a police force of 20,000 by the year \n2000. WOLA also criticized the PNC for having \u201climited oversight \nmechanisms.\u201d86\nWOLA\u2019s conclusions still hold true today, and have been supported \nby failures in security policies over the last 14 years. Just two years after the creation of the PNC, several of the recycled agents were arrested \nfor involvement in illegal activities. More recently, in 2009, the current \nadministration declared it had purged 1,700 police officers from the force \nfor various reasons; some for minor infractions, and others for serious \ncrimes, which merited their arrest and prosecution with help from the \nCICIG.\n87\nIn short, successive administrations in charge of police reform have \nrepeated the same mistake made with the army: expanding its force size \ndramatically while relaxing recruiting controls, and overlooking quality \nstandards for training. \u201cToday you see an effort to produce more bad \npolice officers, with the risk of their potential involvement in illegal \nactivities, than efforts to create incentives for entering a military-type \nacademy, with a basic and well-established doctrine, an academy more \nprone to control,\u201d said M\u00e9rida.88\nWhile the expansion of the police force was underway, in the late \n1990s the army began to withdraw its troops and high-command \nofficials from significant portions of the country. As a result, the \nColombian cartels operating in Guatemala lost the complicity of \nstate structures in their operations. Once the military no longer held \nkey positions of government that could facilitate the transit of illegal \ngoods, Colombians lost their foothold in Guatemala by the end of the \ndecade.89 In the meantime, Guatemalan groups thrived and Mexican \ncriminal networks nurtured contacts with government officials at low \nand middle-management positions in state institutions, just like they had \ndone in Mexico for over 60 years.Julie L\u00f3pez| 164 |The Mexican cartels built a strategic axis with some mayors and public \nofficials in towns along Guatemalan\u2019s border with Mexico and Honduras. \nThe criminal surge that followed caught the police unprepared.\n\u201cWe lost a great opportunity for police reform with the peace \naccords,\u201d said Mack, 14 years later.90 The accords were a new beginning \nthat had allowed skeptical Guatemalans to actually believe the police could improve. Public opinion regarding the PNC improved month after \nmonth as the first groups graduated from the police academy. This was \na development that even surprised government officials who admitted \nhaving made mistakes in the process.\n91\n\u201cEverybody admits it was a mistake to recycle old police agents into \nthe new police, to meet the [peace accords] requirements to cover the \nwhole country,\u201d Porras said. \u201cThe fact that these people returned to the \npolice restored certain vices [in the police] as well.\u201d92 By October 1999 \n(still during the Arz\u00fa administration), 65 percent of the police force\u2014of \n17,339 officers\u2014were recycled officers.\nThe major setbacks were man-made, particularly during the Portillo \nadministration (2000-2004). Mack notes that some PNC directors \nand ministers of interior were not qualified for their positions, based \non standards contained in the PNC Law.93 Additionally, they failed to \nensure continuity in institutional strengthening reforms, which were needed to confront challenges at a regional level. Besides, Porras said \nthat \u201cthe Portillo administration fired several comisarios (police officers of \nthe highest rank), who had a pristine record, and the decay in the PNC was immense\u2026.Crime soared while all this was happening.\u201d \n94\nM\u00e9rida also pointed out that Portillo (2000-2004) made changes that \nleft 16 generals in the high-command, some of whom were corrupt and \nnow are the subject of judicial prosecution.95\nIn June 2004 the army reduced its force by two-thirds, double the \ngoal established in the peace accords. The most affected area was the Pet\u00e9n and the corridor bordering Mexico, in northwestern Guatemala, \naccording to Interior Minister Menocal,\n96 as well as the Zeta strong-\nhold - Alta Verapaz (south of Pet\u00e9n). As a result, says M\u00e9rida, fewer than \n6,000 troops were available to tactically cover the country\u2019s 108,889 \nsquare kilometers. The rest of the troops occupied administrative posts.97\nEduardo Stein\u2014Vice President during Oscar Berger\u2019s administration \n2004-2007\u2014has stated that the army\u2019s downsizing in compliance with Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 165 |the peace accords was prompted by two factors: 1) pressure from the \ninternational community; and 2) the need to correct the number of \ntroops, which had been inflated. \u201cSalaries were being cashed in for \nsoldiers and officers who only existed on paper,\u201d Stein said.98\nThe former vice president argued that the army\u2019s force reduction \nwas conditioned on the PNC\u2019s strengthening and on keeping enough \nmilitary personnel to protect the borders. \u201cThe argument that the army \nwas reduced beyond what the peace accords required, thus leaving the \ncountry vulnerable to drug trafficking, rests on two incorrect premises,\u201d \nsaid Stein. \u201cOne of them is that the army\u2014instead of civilian security \nforces\u2014must control national territory in the fight against drug \ntrafficking; the second one is that organized crime cannot corrupt the army, as opposed to the police.\u201d\n99\nStein argued that the fight against OC has demonstrated that, contrary \nto government assertions, the army is not as efficient as many believe it \nto be, and should not be assigned a civilian security function.100 M\u00e9rida, \nwho retired in July 1998 after a 28-year military career, maintained that the Guatemalan army had not changed its doctrine since the end of the \narmed conflict. \u201cThe first part of the military doctrine is that the army \nis prepared to take an objective by gunfire or maneuvers, or by fire and \ndeployment, or to defend an objective by means of gunfire, or tactical \noperations,\u201d says M\u00e9rida. \u201cThat is what a soldier is trained for; not for \npolice tasks.\u201d\n101 In the same vein, Stein contended that the army cannot \nbe effective at something it was not trained for, despite President Colom\u2019s \nassertions that an increase in military troops in the northern part of the \ncountry has reduced organized crime activity in the area.102\nThere are ample recent examples to support Stein\u2019s assertion that the \nmilitary is not corruption proof. One case involves military weapons \nstolen from an army base that ended up in the hands of the Zetas. \nNevertheless, it is not a question of who is less corrupt, the police or \nthe army; it is a matter of absence of proper internal controls in both \ninstitutions.\nEduardo Stein and M\u00e9rida criticize the use of the armed forces as a \nband-aid solution. In this context, the issue is whether it is appropriate to use the army to provide security\u2014and for how long\u2014when the \npolice lack the force size, capabilities, and weaponry required to combat \norganized crime.Julie L\u00f3pez| 166 |\u201cIf Colom is right about something, or whoever advised him, it is that \nmilitary surveillance was displaced from key areas that had been under \ncontrol for 42 years, and that is a lot,\u201d said Rosada.103 In 1996, the army \nnumbered 54,875 soldiers and officers. By 2011, its numbers had fallen to 17,100, according to the army\u2019s spokesperson, Colonel Ronny Ur\u00edzar.\nThe post-war assumption that, \u201cscores of unoccupied men, whose \nonly ability is to fire a gun, is what led to more violence and crime\u201d does \nnot explain all post-conflict violence. Thus, attributing current security \nchallenges in Guatemala to the armed conflict alone is a myth. The \nconflict is an important context for armed violence, but not the entire explanation. \u201cI always bring up Mexico as an example,\u201d said Porras. \n\u201cWhich armed conflict developed there? Which peace process? [None,] \nand yet the situation there is just as bad, or it\u2019s worse than here.\u201d \n104 \nAccording to Porras, blaming the existence of OC on decades of armed \nconflict and the subsequent failures of the peace process is disingenuous.\nThe central problem is the lack of political will to enforce existing \nlaws and develop long-term security policies that apply to the entire \njustice system. Nonetheless, some in the international community, \nincluding U.S. Ambassador Stephen McFarland, see the creation and \nsupport of CICIG as a sign of political will. \u201cBut you always want more,\u201d McFarland said, and many Guatemalans definitely do.\n105\nAn Atypical Peace Process\nMany countries initiate peace processes that end the conflict, permit the holding of free elections, and eventually mark the beginnings of \ndemocracy. In Guatemala, however, elections preceded the peace \nprocess, primarily because military intelligence became convinced \nthat the guerrillas (URNG) had been defeated militarily.\n106 The \nquestion becomes whether the inverted order, of holding elections before establishing a peace process, permitted a smoother transition \nfrom military to civilian governments or allowed military influence to \nsurvive, even though several civilian administrations took office before \nthe peace accords were signed. Peace processes tend to reduce corruption \nand increase transparency, but the Guatemalan case demonstrated an \natypical process in which the military negotiated a way to step down Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 167 |from governing, while maintaining certain quotas of power within state \ninstitutions.\nThree elections were held prior to the end of the conflict in late 1996 \nand, though free and democratic, the first one (in 1985) was imposed \nby the Guatemalan military. Although civilian presidents took office, \nsome say the military still held \u201chidden power\u201d behind the state\u2019s closed \ndoors. Under civilian rule, violence and repression continued, though \nnot at the worst levels displayed during the armed conflict, when at least 90 percent of human rights violations were attributed to government \nsecurity forces.\n 107\nMilitary influence declined from 1986 to 2010, although it has not \nand probably will never disappear entirely. Nevertheless, Guatemala has had at least one generation without military regimes. \u201cTo blame \nthe military for everything is to avoid the responsibility that belongs to \neverybody, to civilians,\u201d warned Ricardo Stein, who said that the habit \nof using a position of authority for illegal gain is as old as the wheel, \nand that smuggling dates back to colonial times. \u201cThe military are not \nthe only corruptible ones; they are not the only corruptors,\u201d said Stein. \u201cAnd corruption is like sticky caramel sauce. For someone to get a hand \nstuck in it, you have to have the sauce and someone willing to stick their \nhand in it. Two people are needed.\u201d \n108 \nDuring the armed conflict, and in the intervening years, local and \nforeign OC networks have been the corruptors, and both civilian and military authorities have stuck their hand in the sticky, caramel sauce. \nOther factors, such as the lack of a larger professional workforce in \nstate institutions, low government salaries, and a degree of impunity \nthat makes corruption appear to be punishment free, turn corruptible \nemployees into easy targets.\nGuatemala\u2019s Constitution, adopted in 1985, was the product of a \npact between the business elite, the military and the political class, a commitment to move the country out of isolation, which was \naccomplished ten years later. \u201cWe were pariahs, isolated from the \nworld, due to how the local economy was run and human rights \nviolations,\u201d said Ricardo Stein.\n109 The new Constitution was rights-\nbased. It helped close the chapter of the armed conflict and open the doors to a broader political spectrum that included space for the \nguerrillas as a political organization.Julie L\u00f3pez| 168 |Infiltration of the Judicial System, the Congress, the \nExecutive Branch, and the Military\nSeveral cases, during the past two years illustrate how Guatemala\u2019s \njudicial system is infiltrated by organized crime. Since mid-2009, two \nPNC directors have been arrested, one for allegedly stealing seized drugs and money (an accusation of which he was acquitted in 2011), \nand the other in connection with the murder of five counter-narcotics investigators and a corruption case. On September 15, 2010, two police \nofficers were secretly filmed stealing money from the Tikal Futura crime \nscene after a failed attempt to arrest drug trafficker Mauro Salom\u00f3n \nRam\u00edrez (arrested two weeks later).\nIn another case, 32 of 45 known members of the V\u00e9liz Palomo \norganized crime network were captured in late September 2010, \nincluding three prominent individuals. The rest of the suspects remain at large. The network specialized in drug trafficking, extortion and \nmoney laundering, and their criminal headquarters was in Guatemala \nCity. Assistant Prosecutor Gloria Hern\u00e1ndez, who had worked for nine \nyears in the Public Ministry, allegedly assisted the network by altering \nthe indictments of its arrested members, and is now being charged as \nan accomplice. The son of Judge Irma Valenzuela, who presided over \nformer President Portillo\u2019s case, was also involved in the organization, according to press reports. However, authorities did not disclose details \nof the nature of his involvement. The Public Ministry did not indicate \nwhether Judge Valenzuela\u2019s rulings on the Portillo case were being \ncalled into question due to her son\u2019s alleged involvement in the V\u00e9liz \nPalomo case.\n110 The list of defendants also included the president of the \nBaseball Federation, Jos\u00e9 Luis V\u00e9liz Dom\u00ednguez, who has been charged \nin the case as the network\u2019s leader and for allegedly having used the \nfederation to launder money.111 The investigation is still ongoing, but \nthe case shows that OC members can approach a wide spectrum of \npublic officials, or their relatives, to turn them into accomplices in their \ncriminal endeavors.\nIn mid-October 2010, a judge in Quetzaltenango released three \nMexicans and four Guatemalans allegedly belonging to the Mexican \nSinaloa Cartel. The group had been arrested in possession of 124 kilos of \ncocaine and several weapons. Later that month, prosecutors revealed that Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 169 |the incinerated shell of a small plane was recovered in Suchitep\u00e9quez, in \nsouthwestern Guatemala, and claimed that some of the suspects travelled \nas passengers on this plane that was also used to transport the drugs on \nJune 11, 2010.\u201d 112\nOn October 28, a news story broke that six charges against Interim \nAttorney General Mar\u00eda Encarnaci\u00f3n Mej\u00eda were dismissed just before \nshe was appointed on June 11, 2010 and before she requested to be \nconfirmed for another term until 2014. The internal affairs office at the \nPublic Ministry, which did not disclose the nature of the charges against \nher, assured the public that Mej\u00eda did not intervene to get those changes \ndismissed.113 \nThese cases underscore the lack of clearly-defined job responsibility \nfor public officials. Guatemala\u2019s Civil Service Law has not been subject \nto much needed reforms to establish a more professional cadre of civil \nservants. \u201cWhen lack of clarity exists, borders are transgressed, and \nrules are broken,\u201d said Ricardo Stein. The problems are compounded \nwhen a non-professional bureaucracy is installed in office as payment for \npolitical favors or financial support, during the elections, which has been the tendency during the past several administrations.\n114\nAfter 1996, the guarantees that criminals needed to operate were \nalready in place inside the state. \u201cIf you want information, you don\u2019t \nhave to infiltrate, you have to be a part of it,\u201d said Porras.115 The case of \nassistant prosecutor Hern\u00e1ndez exemplifies the benefits for OC networks in finding allies inside the state.\nFrom 2004 to 2006, when ruling party congressman Mauro Guzm\u00e1n \nwas governor of Huehuetenango, a state bordering Mexico, he knew \nof police complicity in many kinds of trafficking. \u201cWe understood \nthat the chief of police of Huehuetenango received Q250,000 monthly \n(some US$31,250) in return for letting anyone and anything through the border,\u201d the congressman recalls. Guzm\u00e1n revealed that the chief of \npolice would lead the way in his police car as a bus or two loaded with \nundocumented migrants followed close behind to the Mexican border. \nGuzm\u00e1n, president of the Migrants Commission in the Congress, \nblamed impunity for such corruption. \u201cDespite the tens of thousands of \nmigrants who pass through Guatemala to reach Mexico and the United \nStates, I cannot recall a single case of anyone convicted of trafficking migrants. This is part of the traffickers\u2019 success.\u201d\n116Julie L\u00f3pez| 170 |The Colom administration also has endured its share of infiltrators, \nor questionable public officials. Salvador G\u00e1ndara, the second of five \nMinisters of the Interior that Colom has appointed to date, was accused \nof misleading CICIG investigators in the Rodrigo Rosenberg case,117 \namong other irregularities. G\u00e1ndara, who was Arz\u00fa\u2019s Vice Minister \nof the Interior, was also responsible for appointing PNC Director \nPorfirio P\u00e9rez Paniagua, who was arrested for allegedly having stolen \nseized drugs and money (an estimated 350 kilos of cocaine and some \nUS$300,000) in 2009. However, by February 2011 P\u00e9rez Paniagua\u2014\nwho was represented by a public defender\u2014had been acquitted on both \ncounts due to lack of evidence.118\nG\u00e1ndara was asked to leave Colom\u2019s cabinet and returned in early \n2010 to the mayor\u2019s office in Villa Nueva (a province neighboring \nGuatemala City), a position to which he was elected in 2007. While \nhe lent significant political support to the Colom electoral campaign, \nG\u00e1ndara now remains under investigation by the Public Ministry \nin connection with the misuse of public resources in the Villa Nueva \nmunicipality. In early 2011, he was forced to leave his position as mayor, \nas well, to prevent him from obstructing the investigation. \n\u201cG\u00e1ndara couldn\u2019t stay [in the government],\u201d Colom explained in \n2010. \u201cObviously, the political cost [of removing him] was tremendous, but he couldn\u2019t stay because he appointed P\u00e9rez [Paniagua]. Then, the \nnext minister [Ra\u00fal Vel\u00e1squez] stuck his hands in the money, and I \ncouldn\u2019t allow that either.\u201d\n119 \nAlmost six months after his July 2009 appointment as Minister of \nInterior, Vel\u00e1squez was accused by government prosecutors of pocketing US$5 million that were destined to buy fuel for police cars. The money \nwas allegedly used to buy property in Vel\u00e1squez\u2019s name. The former \nminister remained at large for almost a year and turned himself in to \nauthorities in January 2011. His case is still ongoing and has not led to a \ntrial yet. Now, Colom says that Minister Menocal made good progress in 2010, even though a lot remains to be done.\nIn 2008, the president\u2019s security detail discovered that Colom\u2019s offices, \nas well as those of the First Lady, had been wiretapped, and the head of \nexecutive branch security, Carlos Quintanilla, was held responsible.\n 120 \nQuintanilla remained at large for months until he agreed to turn himself in at the court that issued his arrest warrant. He was subsequently released Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 171 |on bail and, in 2010, acquitted due to a lack of evidence indicating that \nhe had installed the wiretapping and microphone devices.\nAfter that, Colom had difficulty explaining what became of his \ncampaign slogan that he would \u201cfight against violence with intelligence,\u201d \na response to his strongest opponent, retired General Otto P\u00e9rez Molina, \nwhose slogan was \u201cIron fist against violence\u201d (interpreted as the use of \nsheer force).\n\u201cWe had a security team, but our party is not the exception when \nit comes to infiltrations,\u201d Colom conceded. \u201cThe preparation stages of the national security plan underestimated the real problems in the \nMinistry of the Interior. Maybe our evaluation indicated a level 10 of \nproblems, when the reality was that the level was 120, or 80. There was \na misconception of reality because [before the elections] we were the \nopposition, and we didn\u2019t have \u2018inside\u2019 information.\u201d\n121\nInside information became available in early 2008 when Vinicio \nG\u00f3mez was appointed Minister of the Interior to the Colom administration. He had previously served as Vice Minister of the Interior \nunder Adela de Torrebiarte\u2019s term as minister, from 2007 to the end of \nthe Berger administration, one which exercised stronger controls within \nthe police. Colom\u2019s efforts to ensure continuity in policies and practices \nby making this appointment were interrupted when G\u00f3mez was killed \nin a helicopter accident in July 2008.\n \u201cPutting things in order and cleansing security forces has not been \neasy,\u201d Colom said. \u201cMy principle is that if the head is healthy, the body will heal.\u201d So far, the cleansing strategy has led him to dismiss three top \nofficials in the Ministry of Defense.\n122\nThe army has not escaped infiltration either. In March 2009, weapons \nbelonging to the army, mostly machine guns, ammunition, and grenades, were found at a training camp believed to be operated by the Zetas in \nQuich\u00e9, in northern Guatemala. According to the Public Ministry and \nColom, the weapons had been stolen from a warehouse on a military \nbase in Guatemala City.\nOther weapons from the same lot were found in a warehouse rented \nby the Zetas in Amatitl\u00e1n (close to Guatemala City) in late April 2009. In this case, five counter-narcotics detectives were killed (the same \ncase in which one police director\u2014Baltazar G\u00f3mez\u2014was charged, an \nindictment that led to his arrest). One source from the Public Ministry Julie L\u00f3pez| 172 |stated that, although the police declared that these counter-narcotics \ndetectives were on an investigative mission to search the warehouse, \ntheir real intention was to steal drugs and money. When other police \nofficers arrived at the scene, they found the detectives dead, and seized \nat least 500 grenades and 5,000 rounds of ammunition for machine \nguns. The ammunition was packed in boxes with a logo that read \n\u201cGuatemalan Military Industry\u201d and was found next to landmines of \nmilitary manufacture, along with a black vest with white letters that read \u201cNarcotics Officer.\u201d\n123  Among the seized weaponry was \u201cone machine \ngun that belonged to a lot purchased during the Berger administration,\u201d \nsaid Minister Menocal.124\nThe judicial investigation of the Amatitl\u00e1n case led to the arrest \nin February 2010 of Baltazar G\u00f3mez, who was then PNC director; Nelly Bonilla, the head of the PNC\u2019s counter-narcotics unit (DAIA, \nits acronym in Spanish), and police officer Fernando Carrillo. They \nare also suspects in the disappearance of an undetermined amount of \ncocaine from the warehouse.\n125 G\u00f3mez, Bonilla and Carrillo insist on \ntheir innocence. Another three police officers and three civilians have \nbeen prosecuted on the same charges.\nIn a context of police scandals and rising violence (one death every 81 \nminutes on average), in July 2010, Obdulio Sol\u00f3rzano, former head of \nthe National Fund for Peace (Fonapaz) was gunned down while riding \nthrough a wealthy neighborhood in Guatemala City in a brand new SUV. \nSol\u00f3rzano was one of Colom\u2019s campaign financiers and described by the president as a \u201cgreat executive.\u201d Yet, Colom dismissed him in April \n2009 amid corruption rumors. Several charges had been brought against \nSol\u00f3rzano for his mishandling of Q1.4 billion (US$175 million).\n126\nAn adviser to the Colom administration said that Sol\u00f3rzano was \nusing Fonapaz to launder drug trafficking money, by hiring construction \ncompanies with links to organized crime to build infrastructure \nprojects for municipalities in northeastern Guatemala. The adviser said \nthat Sol\u00f3rzano was fired after the U.S. Embassy told the government \nabout his alleged ties to organized crime in Alta Verapaz in northern \nGuatemala.127 Sol\u00f3rzano was also accused of processing contracts for \nQ440 million (US$55 million) that were not honored and had to be rescinded and reassigned to other vendors.Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 173 |According to Colom, Sol\u00f3rzano had admitted to being friends with \npeople \u201cwho had been linked to drug trafficking,\u201d although no proof \ncould be found of that link. The president explained that Sol\u00f3rzano, \na former member of Congress for the governing party, was fired \u201cdue \nto a strong suspicion that he could be involved in something of that \nnature,\u201d referring to the drug trafficking links. Colom elaborated \nfurther saying, \u201can investigation of this case was inconclusive, but\u2014\nlike the popular Guatemalan phrase says\u2014\u2018when the river is noisy, it\u2019s because it\u2019s carrying stones,\u2019 and so a decision to separate him [from \nFonapaz] was made.\u201d\nIn an interview, Colom said that the way in which Sol\u00f3rzano was \nmurdered\u201450 casings from AK-47 and 9 mm ammunition were \nfound at the crime scene\u2014indicates that the motive was \u201cthick.\u201d \u201cIt \nwas a narco-style murder, although we don\u2019t have evidence of that; \nbut the circumstances appear to indicate there was a relation there,\u201d the president said. Colom denied having received any information \nfrom the U.S. Embassy regarding Sol\u00f3rzano. \u201cNormally there are \ncommunication exchanges between intelligence offices, and that \ninformation is considered, but in Obdulio\u2019s case there was none of that \nas far as I can remember.\u201d\n128\nThe Congress has not been immune from accusations regarding \nties to OC. In October 2010, former representative Manuel Castillo \nstood trial for the murder of the three Salvadoran Central American \nParliament (Parlacen) representatives and their driver, perpetrated in \nJanuary 2007. Castillo was accused of being the mastermind of the \nmurders, a vengeance killing requested by a Salvadoran congressman. \nCastillo, who has also been linked to the robbery and redistribution of \ndrugs in Jutiapa, a province along the Guatemala-El Salvador border, was convicted in early December 2010 and sentenced to 203 years in \nprison. His accomplices received similarly harsh prison sentences.\nSometimes cries about Congress\u2019 complicity come from within, \nwhen laws that target organized crime are blocked or stymied by lengthy \ndebates. Two examples include the Law for Private Security Companies \nand the Seized Assets Law, designed to combat organized crime. \u201cMaybe \nsome people in the Congress have a glass ceiling and that\u2019s why the approval processes for certain laws are being stalled,\u201d said H\u00e9ctor Nuila, \na Member of Congress from the UNRG.\n129 The Seized Assets Law Julie L\u00f3pez| 174 |was finally approved by the Congress in early December 2010 after \nmonths of deliberation, but lacks additional provisions regarding \ncriteria for its application. The Law for Private Security Companies \nwas approved in 2011.\nNuila, who recognizes that his left-wing party has minimal influence \nbecause of the small number of seats it holds in Congress, also criticized \nhow the Arms and Munitions Law was reformed. \u201cUnfortunately it took \nten years to draft the law and people say it hasn\u2019t served the purpose of disarming the population because it was not designed for that,\u201d he says. \n\u201cHow is it possible that [the law] allows each person to carry a maximum \nof three weapons, and as much ammunition as a soldier uses for shooting \npractice in three months? The law seems to have been designed to \naid the dirty business of arms trafficking.\u201d\n130 Several congressional \nrepresentatives are believed to be associated with owners of armories, or \nprivate security companies, which could benefit from this law. However, \nno allegations have been backed up by formal evidence. By 2011, the \nlaw had undergone further modifications that now allow each person to \ncarry more than three weapons with the required permits.\nTerritory Seized by Criminals\nA May 2010 article from the Strategic Studies Institute warned that \u201cthe influence of non-state criminal actors rivals or exceeds that of \nthe government in up to 40 percent of the country.\u201d The report also \nindicates that the trend \u201cis apparent in institutional terms, as criminal \ngroups have colonized sectors of the government and turned the state to \ntheir own purposes.\u201d\n131\nIn contrast, President Colom says there is not a single area in the \ncountry where the army or the police cannot enter. Yet, he admits \u201cthere \nis definitely infiltration (by criminal groups) in all kinds of structures, \nnot only in the government.\u201d132 This type of infiltration leads to the \nexercise of more subtle control than physical occupation of a territory, \nand it\u2019s more difficult to combat. Subsequently, OC has won \u201chearts and \nminds,\u201d just as occupying armed forces try to do in populated areas near \ncombat zones. This type of infiltration requires violence only as a last \nresort because subjects recognize and respect the criminal group\u2019s power. Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 175 |If such recognition were absent, it would be imposed by instilling fear \nthrough violence.\nAs recently as March 2011, the Zetas allegedly tried to instill fear in \none of two police officers who seized a drug shipment in Raxruh\u00e1, Alta \nVerapaz. The officer was new to the area and had only been assigned \nan official mobile phone for three days when he began receiving \nthreatening calls. The phone had previously been assigned to police \nofficers in Cob\u00e1n, the capital of Alta Verapaz. \u201cFirst, the person calling, a man with a Mexican accent, offered him US$250,000 to release the \nshipment,\u201d said Minister Menocal. \u201cWhen the police officer refused, \nhe was offered US$500,000. After that the caller indicated he knew \nhis address, home phone number, whom he lived with and how many \nchildren he had.\u201d Menocal said that the police officer and his family \nwere relocated immediately. The assistant prosecutor participating in \nthe operation\u2014Allan Stowlinsky Vidaurre, mentioned above\u2014was not as fortunate.\n133 \nThe drug seizure operation took place a few weeks after a two-month \nstate of siege had come to an end in Alta Verapaz, a measure intended to return governance to the area. Minister Menocal claimed in the local \npress that violence was reduced by 57 percent, nearly 100 weapons were \nseized, and 22 people were arrested as a result of the government\u2019s action. \nYet no major players in the drug trafficking business were captured. The \nstate of siege raised concerns from human rights groups, but several citizens maintained that the state of siege reduced violence in the area.\n134\nSome sources attest that the Zetas kept a lower profile after the state \nof siege was lifted, but nevertheless resumed their activities in the region \nas the March drug seizure proves.135 As mentioned above, on May 24, \n2011, the Zetas claimed responsibility for the murder of local assistant prosecutor Allan Stowlinsky Vidaurre, whose dismembered body was \nfound in downtown Cob\u00e1n, Alta Verapaz, in apparent retaliation for the \nseizure of cocaine in Raxruh\u00e1 two months earlier. The Zetas claimed in \na hand-written message left by the victim\u2019s body that the seized cocaine \namounted to 500 kilos.\n136 Minister Menocal has said that Stowlinsky\u2019s \nonly role in the operation was to count the drugs seized.137 The day \nof the gruesome finding the minister had revealed to radio reporters that the shipment consisted in 470 kilos; subsequent press reports quoted \npolice statements indicating the drugs seized amounted to 453 kilos. Julie L\u00f3pez| 176 |The assistant prosecutor had been working for five years in the Public \nMinistry, four of which had been in Cob\u00e1n. \nPresident Colom said that traffickers also instill fear in authorities at \na municipal level. \u201cOne example involves a mayor in Alta Verapaz [a \nstrong hold for the Zetas],\u201d said Colom. \u201cHe cannot open his mouth \nbecause he is surrounded by violence, threats, and terror. Even though \nthe mayor is clean, his behavior is controlled by these criminals.\u201d138 \nAnother state of siege was imposed on May 16, 2001, in Pet\u00e9n, after \nthe Zetas murdered 27 peasants at a ranch, allegedly in retaliation for \nlosing a drug shipment at the hands of the ranch\u2019s owner, Otto Salguero, \nwho went missing.139 Since then, several Mexican and Guatemalan \nsuspects have been arrested in connection with the massacre in Pet\u00e9n as well as in the case of the murder of assistant prosecutor Stowlinsky.\nIn addition to confronting crime and OC, the police also face \nhostility from the population. On October 10, 2010, residents of \nChichicastenango, Quich\u00e9, destroyed a police car and the police station \nafter authorities arrested a man accused of mugging motorcycle taxis at \ngunpoint. The mob unsuccessfully tried to lynch the presumed criminal on the assumption that he would be set free shortly after his arrest. \nUnfortunately, statistics support this perception. In a sample of 600,000 \ncases studied by CICIG, there were indictments in only 1.8 percent of \nthe cases.\n140 These statistics do not reflect the cases in which innocent \npeople are arrested and imprisoned despite the lack of evidence, such as former police director Porfirio P\u00e9rez Paniagua. Police officers are \nsometimes the villain or the scapegoat, and many times end up dead. At \nleast 47 police officers were killed between January and October 2010.\n141 \nBy June 2011, there had been several incidents involving attacks against the police to protest the arrest of suspects that mobs either wanted to \nlynch themselves or have released. These incidents reflect the public\u2019s \nlimited regard for the police as authority figures.\nIn Guatemala, OC has filled the voids of power and authority in \nseveral regions of the country.  OC pays for the electrification of urban \nareas, paves streets, and employs locals in its businesses enterprises. Local capos, like Vargas, used these methods more than twenty years \nago in Zacapa. Now, organized crime groups have followed suit all over Guatemala.Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 177 |\u201cGenerating a better quality of life gives [OC structures] the power \nto influence large groups of people,\u201d said M\u00e9rida,142 and turns them into \nwilling informants and a surveillance structure. This type of control was \nused to foil government attempts to arrest major OC figures such as four \nmembers of the Lorenzana family in Zacapa, wanted by a district court \nin Washington, DC for conspiring to transport and import cocaine \ninto the United States. Since July 2009, at least three operations with \ncombined Guatemalan and U.S. forces have failed to take these four men \ninto custody. During one operation, the entire family was found in their house, save the four defendants. The attempted arrests were followed \nby demonstrations in the family\u2019s hometown, organized and led by the \nyounger members of the Lorenzana family. Clearly, the degree of control \nthe Lorenzanas have over their territory has become their safety net.\nUntil the arrest of Lorenzana in Lima on a lonely road outside Zacapa \non April 26,\n143 the case stood in stark contrast to that of Mauro Salom\u00f3n \nRam\u00edrez, who was located and arrested along with several family members. Lorenzana\u2019s three sons, also wanted by a Washington, D.C. \ndistrict court, remain at large.\nThe Colom government is the first to openly pursue the Lorenzanas. \nSome say that it has been compelled to do so by the United States and the \nindictment in the district court. In fact, before 2009, no public official \nhad ever formally and openly accused the Lorenzanas of drug trafficking. They were mostly mentioned in off-the-record conversations. \nColom believes that the 2009 arrest attempts on the Lorenzanas\u2019 were \nsabotaged because they have successfully infiltrated state agencies. There \nis speculation that they received warnings from a police chief in Zacapa, \nofficers expelled from the PNC in 2009 and 2010, or the community \nwhere the Lorenzanas live. According to a retired detective, the police in \nZacapa keep the Lorenzanas informed of any attempt to arrest them\u2014a warning system that clearly failed on April 26.\nOn another front, assessing the scope of organized crime\u2019s influence \non local authorities is difficult when they have potentially been coaxed, \nthreatened, or bought off. In one case, mayors pressured municipalities \nand Development Councils in Izabal, Zacapa, and Pet\u00e9n to hire \nconstruction companies belonging to the Lorenzanas to build several Julie L\u00f3pez| 178 |projects, or to extract sand from river banks.144 In other cases, mayors are \npressured to make decisions favoring OC.\nThere is much silence in the face of these irregularities. \u201cI was struck, \n[while attending] a Security Cabinet meeting down in Izabal a couple of \nyears ago, [how] person after person was talking to the president (Colom) \nregarding their concerns about security and [they] all revolved around, \n\u2018we\u2019ve seen people with weapons, machine guns, out-of-towners looking \nlike this or that,\u2019\u201d U.S. Ambassador McFarland recounted in an October 2010 interview. \u201cFinally, one guy got up and said, \u2018let\u2019s not be cowards; \nwe are talking about narco traffickers;\u2019 but he was the exception.\u201d\n145\nThe Role of Guatemalan OC Networks from South to \nNorth America \nThe general consensus is that Guatemala occupies a strategic geographic \nposition in Latin America, next to Mexico, Belize, Honduras, and El \nSalvador, having coasts on two oceans. Its location makes the country \nvery attractive to OC. \nMexican Ambassador to Guatemala Eduardo Ibarrola describes \nGuatemala\u2019s geopolitical position as a liability. \u201cMexico and Central \nAmerica\u2019s geographic position makes them awfully vulnerable because \nwe are located between the drug producers\u2014in this case, of cocaine\u2014in the Andean countries, and the great consumers market, [the United \nStates],\u201d said the Ambassador.\n146 Ibarrola indicated that Central America \nhas also turned into a consumers market because OC has been paying transportation and protection costs in drugs that they were unable to \ntransport into the United States.\n147 Increased consumption in the region \nhas stimulated small-scale sales and violence, resulting from efforts by \nOC to protect their market and territories.\nCritical migration routes also run through Central America and \nMexico. \u201cThe great labor market for undocumented migrants is, at \nthe end of the day, the United States, and we are also on the route for \ntrafficked arms\u2014which runs in the opposite direction, from north \nto south,\u201d explained Ibarrola,148 who has been in Guatemala almost \nthree years.Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 179 |Marijuana and poppy are also grown in the region. The poppy, \nfound near the Guatemala-Mexico border, is used to produce heroin \nor synthetic drugs\u2014like meth\u2014in an undetermined number of \nclandestine labs. These drugs are consumed in Mexico, the United \nStates, and Europe.\nGuatemala and Mexico share a border that is one thousand \nkilometers long, with eight immigration crossing points that cover \nless than 25 percent of the border. There are also countless illegal, or blind, crossing points, some of which congressman Guzm\u00e1n has \nsaid are not actually so blind. The state he represents, Huehuetenango, \nshares a border with Mexico that is 200 linear kilometers long and \nit has two official border crossing points at La Mesilla and Gracias a \nDios. \u201cThere is no control,\u201d says Guzm\u00e1n. \u201cYou can see the flows of \n[undocumented] migrants passing through next to La Mesilla (a legal \ncrossing point), with no control.\u201d\n149\nThe border\u2019s porous qualities also allow the nearly 100,000 legal \nGuatemalan workers employed in Mexico to cross the border to reach \ntheir jobs on coffee plantations and in service and construction industries.  \nIbarrola says that, \u201cAs long as the border allows these Guatemalans to \ntravel to Mexico and return to Guatemala, it also allows them to stay in \ntheir country over the long term, or visit their relatives in Guatemala, \nand not what has happened at the [Mexican] northern border, where \ndifficulties in crossing has led migrants to opt for a permanent stay.\u201d150 \nHowever, Ibarrola believes it is important to legalize the status of \nGuatemalan migrants who work in Mexico.\nIn certain cases the lack of infrastructure to legally process the volumes \nof people and merchandise going through the border encourages illegal \nborder crossings, according to Ibarrola. In some cases, street vendors \nsimply block the border crossings, and in other cases customs agents are \ninadequately equipped to deal with commercial traffic and must examine each truck individually.\nIllegal border crossings are used by people returning to their jobs \nor transporting merchandise they have legally purchased at home. \nSmugglers also use these crossings for merchandise illegally produced, \npurchased\u2014perhaps even stolen\u2014and transported. The first group \nmakes the detection of the second more difficult.Julie L\u00f3pez| 180 |Minister Menocal explains that outsourcing allows different \nnetworks, structures, and organizations involved in OC to intersect \nwhen trafficking humans, drugs, arms, money, stolen vehicles, and \ncontraband. Some do not branch out to other areas, but most do. For \ninstance, both extortionists and kidnappers may buy vehicles from a \nnetwork engaged exclusively in car theft. Both bank robbers and drug \ntraffickers may buy weapons from the same arms trafficker. They all \nnetwork within Central America and are ultimately tied\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014to larger organizations in other regions.\nThe recruitment of former members of the Guatemalan military \nspecial Kaibil forces by Mexican organized crime networks is another \nexample. Both the Sinaloa cartel and the Zetas recruit retired Kaibiles because it gives them an edge over Guatemala\u2019s civilian security forces, \nwhich are reduced in number and capabilities. In addition, M\u00e9rida \nexplains that the Mexican groups have also capitalized on the clout they have had for years with local authorities in municipalities along the \ncountry\u2019s borders.\n151\nFurthermore, in the one-month period between mid-September \nand mid-October 2010 alone, nearly US$3 million were seized from organized criminal groups in Guatemala. These figures indicate that \na significant amount of drug money is moving along and across the \ncountry. If this sizeable sum is added together with the more than US$8 \nmillion seized in El Salvador, M\u00e9rida posits that one can grasp the extent \nto which the system is corrupted.\nLinks Between Organized Crime and Other Forms of \nCriminal Activity in Guatemala\nWhile some OC networks engage in a variety of criminal activities, \ncertain networks have specialized and provide specialty services to larger \norganizations. 152 \u201cFor instance, car theft is a big, multi-national and \ntrans-continental business,\u201d said Menocal. \u201cCar robbers cater to maras  \n(gangs) and to narcos  (organized crime), and maras  account for 48 percent \nof criminal activity in Guatemala City and 41 percent on a national level.\u201d Maras  use stolen cars to engage in extortion and several other \ncrimes. Public Ministry statistics indicate that, between January 2008 Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 181 |and mid April 2010 an average of 37 vehicles were stolen per day in the \ncountry and 63 percent of the car thefts occurred in the central district, \nwhere Guatemala City is located.153\nThe police and Menocal say that organized crime groups provide \nmaras with drugs to sell on a small scale. This has spawned fights between \ngangs for territorial control, particularly in the northern part of the \ncapital, in Zones 6 and 18. Gangs also fight among themselves for their \nshare of the extortion market. Furthermore, the Minister maintained \nthat some gangs obtained firearms through the Zetas. \u201cTwo and a half \nyears ago, we could tell that the maras  were still using makeshift rifles,\u201d \nhe recalls. \u201cNow they use AK-47s, Galils, AR-15s, machine-guns with \nlaser visors, plus 9 mm and .40 brand new guns.\u201d154\nOne former Mara Salvatrucha member admitted that in 1996, his \ngroup had enough money to buy weapons from a military officer. They \nmade money from extortion of home owners and businesses, kidnapping, \nselling drugs on the streets, breaking into homes to steal valuable objects, \nand selling stolen cars they had bought from a separate structure. One \npolice detective reported that the Salvatruchas provide security for drug \nshipments belonging to the Sinaloa cartel, and also collected payments \nfor the drug trafficking group in southwestern Guatemala. The detective claimed that the Salvatruchas had closer ties to OC than the Barrio 18 \ngang, which focuses more on small-scale drug sales, common crime, and \nextorting owners of public transportation companies. Both groups\u2014\nnumbering from 12,000 to 200,000 in Guatemala, according to different \nsources\u2014are well-armed.\n155\nArms trafficking is high on the list of concerns for Mexico; \nAmbassador Ibarrola says that Mexico is between two countries (the \nUnited States and Guatemala) that have very permissive arms policies. \nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) recorded \nthat in 2008 arms trafficking was a US$20 billion business in Mexico \nand the United States alone.156\nColom claimed that, because most of the arms in the illegal market \nare purchased at the U.S. border, efforts to control the flow should be \nredoubled given that there is mutual responsibility. \u201cDrugs go through \nus to the north, but we get weapons and dirty money in return,\u201d the \nPresident said.157 In the first ten months of 2010, the police seized Q23.3 \nmillion (US$2.9 million) in cash, 79 percent of which was seized in a Julie L\u00f3pez| 182 |single weekend.  This amount was almost double the 2009 total seized - \nQ12.7 million.158\nArms trafficking routes are difficult to identify and trace. After one \nthousand grenades and thousands of ammunition rounds for automatic \nrifles and machine guns were seized from the Zetas in 2009, counter-\nnarcotics prosecutor Leonel Ruiz speculated that perhaps the Zetas are \nalso engaged in arms trafficking.159 Since then, no other large illegal \nweapons caches have been found in Guatemala, except for those seized in different operations during the state of siege in Alta Verapaz between \nDecember 2010 and February 2011, and in Pet\u00e9n, since May 16, 2011. \nHowever, between 2008 and early 2011, Guatemalan authorities seized \n700 assault rifles, 500 pistols or guns, and 40,000 rounds of ammunition \nof different calibers.\n160 At least two of these guns, found in the hands \nof the Zetas in 2008, were purchased in Texas. In 2009, another 23 weapons purchased in Tennessee were traced to the Lorenzanas and \nMendozas families.\n161\nAmbassador McFarland agreed that weapons from the United States \nare being trafficked to Guatemala, but also notes that \u201ca lot of Guatemalan \nweapons from military stocks have been stolen and sold over the years.\u201d \nMany of these were seized from the Zetas. It remains unclear whether \nall the weapons and ammunition were stolen from the army, or whether \nsome were purchased from the Guatemalan military industry by a third \nparty. The easy availability of firearms in the country is undiminished \nas the result of a lenient gun ownership law, which has prompted the CICIG to request further modifications to the law. \nEstimates suggest that between 1.2 million and 1.8 million \nunregistered weapons are in use in Guatemala, twice as many as in \nHonduras and four times more than in El Salvador, according to a 2010 \nstudy.  (In addition, there were at least 187,375 registered weapons as \nof 2010.) There is an approximate ratio of one unregistered weapon \nfor every nine inhabitants. Of these, at least one million weapons are registered (although police sources claim that is the number of weapons \nin the illegal market). Up until 2007, 89 percent of the homicides that \noccurred in Guatemala involved the use of firearms, a percentage higher \nthan that of El Salvador and Colombia. Official importation records \nfrom 2006 and 2007 indicate that the registered weapons originated not \nonly in the United States but also in Colombia and Argentina.\n162Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 183 |The large number of guns on the streets helps account for the rising \nnumber of homicides involving firearms in Guatemala. On the weekend \nof October 23 and 24, 2010, 61 people were shot and killed in different \nattacks throughout the country\u2014more than one death per hour. On \nOctober 27, 2010, alone, the police seized 14 guns in a number of search \nand arrest operations. The availability of weapons and the ease with \nwhich they can be smuggled into the country, or be bought or stolen, \nhas benefited criminal organizations, particularly in rural areas where there is limited police presence.\nLinks between extortion and drug trafficking were apparent in only \none case in 2010. This case involved the V\u00e9liz Palomo group\u2014the \norganized crime group that laundered money and trafficked in drugs.\nAccording to Menocal, until 2010 and unlike Mexico, there were \nno apparent links between drug trafficking and local kidnapping rings. \nWhile there has been ongoing DTO activity, the current administration has seen a drop in kidnapping cases, from 213 in 2008 to 66 in 2010 \n(through September). Yet nearly Q15 million (US$1.9 million) has been \npaid in ransom between 2008 and 2010, and at least 183 people have \nbeen arrested. \u201cThese groups maintain minimum but steady activity,\u201d \npurports the Minister.\n163 \nThe kidnappers\u2019 main area of operation is in south and southwestern \nGuatemala (Totonicap\u00e1n, Quetzaltenango, San Marcos, and Escuintla). Although the Sinaloa Cartel operates in much of the same area, there \nare no known links between the cartel and the kidnappers, except in the \ncase of reprisals for drug theft.\nIn mid-June 2010, the Public Ministry (PM) tracked down a small \nairplane in Retalhuleu (other reports indicate it was in Suchitep\u00e9quez) on Guatemala\u2019s southern coast. \u201cApparently the pilot got lost and the \nplane was found in the middle of a sugar cane plantation,\u201d said a PM \ninvestigator. Given the plane\u2019s size, authorities estimated that it had \ncontained originally at least 300 kilos of cocaine; yet only 124 packages \nwere recovered, each one weighing approximately 1.5 kilo (for a total of \nnearly 186 kilos). It is the same case in which three Mexicans and four \nGuatemalans were arrested and, four months later, released by a judge, despite the evidence seized.\n164\nThe PM learned that, following the drug seizures and arrests, an \nundetermined number of relatives of people who lived near the area Julie L\u00f3pez| 184 |where the plane landed had either been killed or kidnapped. The \ninvestigator suspects that the victims were targeted by drug traffickers in \nreprisal for taking the missing packages from the plane.165\nBy June 2011, Menocal revealed that some drug trafficking groups \nhad begun extorting business owners, among others, particularly in Huehuetenango near the border with Mexico, following the patterns of \ncriminal groups in Mexican territory.\n166\nMulti-tasking is not uncommon to OC in Guatemala. Some say \nthat drug-trafficking sometimes intersects with human trafficking in \nGuatemala, although no statistics prove that this is a trend. Congressman \nGuzm\u00e1n says that when he was governor of Huehuetenango (2004-2006), \none of his workers traveled to the United States as an undocumented \nmigrant, and later on told him that \u201che was hand-picked, along with a \nHonduran woman, separated from a large group of migrants, and given \na backpack.\u201d According to Guzm\u00e1n, \u201cObviously there was a certain amount of drugs inside, and the men who chose them kept a close eye on \nthem throughout the journey.\u201d Guzm\u00e1n believes this practice continues \ninto the present.\n167\nEven transportation of small amounts of drugs can be profitable when \ncombined with human trafficking. The numbers are self-explanatory. \nOne kilo of cocaine costs about US$11,000 in Guatemala, and can be \nsold for up to US$16,000 or more in major cities in the United States. \n\u201cThis means that any possibility of transporting even one kilo is good \nbusiness,\u201d says Guzm\u00e1n, who believes that undocumented migrants, \norganized crime groups, and arms traffickers use exactly the same routes \nbecause they go through OC-controlled territories.168\nLinks Between Guatemalan Organized Crime Groups, \nYouth Gangs, and Other Violent Actors in Central \nAmerica, Mexico, and Colombia. \nYouth gangs, or maras, are ever-present in Central America and especially \nin the northern triangle of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. \nThe main gangs in Guatemala are the Pandilla Barrio18 and the Mara \nSalvatrucha. Although gangs are a growing problem in the United States, \nparticularly in large cities with a significant Hispanic population, they Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 185 |seem to have bypassed most of Mexico. Ambassador Ibarrola revealed \nthat gang activity in Mexico is concentrated in the south, in Chiapas, \nclose to the border with Guatemala. Rosada, also a sociologist, reported \nthat the gang presence is linked to poverty, which explains why gangs \nare active mostly in Chiapas, one of the poorest Mexican states, and why \nthey have sprouted in several areas outside Guatemala City. 169\nGangs generally operate at a local level, and movement of gang members \nbetween neighboring countries appears limited, although Honduran and \nNicaraguan suspects occasionally are arrested in Guatemala. However, \nsome groups engage in car theft or other illegal activities at a transnational \nlevel. Guatemala serves as a departure point for stolen cars that are sold \nas parts or as whole vehicles (with modifications ordered by catalog), \nthroughout Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, \naccording to Minister Menocal. Some cars, he says, have even ended up in the Netherlands and Denmark.\n170\nIn contrast to gangs, kidnappers have downsized their operations to \nGuatemala. This is a departure from their modus operandi in the late \n1990s, when some organizations operating in Guatemala, El Salvador, \nand Nicaragua would kidnap a victim in one country and demand the \npayment of ransom in another.  Extortionists, when operating on a \nsmall scale, keep their movements and funds local. Yet, larger extortion \norganizations may be merged with money laundering structures or \norganized crime. They tend to operate in several Central American countries and send their money to banking systems where it cannot \nbe easily traced. One example is the extortion ring linked to the V\u00e9liz \nPalomo group in Guatemala.\n171\nHuman trafficking networks operate with an organizational \ninfrastructure that is almost as wide as that of organized crime, and have \na different set of complexities than international car theft. All share the \nsame principles: strategy, unlimited resources, and the ability to recruit \ncorrupt public officials. The Ministry of the Interior has found out that \nlocal leaders of trafficking networks that traffic undocumented migrants \nhave strong ties to South America, primarily with Ecuador, Brazil, and \nBolivia. Some belong to structures that kidnap women for forced labor or sexual slavery. \u201cSome of the people being trafficked had another \nintended destination, but ended up staying in Guatemala,\u201d says Menocal. Julie L\u00f3pez| 186 |\u201cPeople from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and South \nAmericans passing through those countries, come to Guatemala.\u201d172\nAs CICIG Commissioner Francisco Dall\u2019Anese once put it, OC \nstructures \u201cglobalized before anyone else.\u201d173 The branch operating in \nGuatemala was no exception.\nGeography, Organization, and Structure of National \nand Transnational Organized Crime in Guatemala\nIn March 2009, when Dall\u2019Anese was still the attorney general of Costa \nRica (and had not yet been appointed head of the CICIG), he was asked \nabout the evolution of drug trafficking in Central America. His response \nwas candid and blunt: \u201cWhile criminals are traveling by elevator, the \nrest of us are climbing the stairs.\u201d174\nAccording to the U.S. International Narcotics Control Strategy \nReport (INCSR) in 2010, \u201cGuatemala is at the epicenter of the drug threat.\u201d\n175 In Guatemala the growth of organized crime can be measured \nin a variety of different ways. The first set of measurements relates to seizures. In 2009, a record year for seizures of illegal drugs, money, \nvehicles, and property, the total value of the seized items was equal to \n5.4 percent of the country\u2019s GDP\u2014a stark contrast to the 1.2 percent \nof  GDP that the state invests in security. Although the U.S. Narcotics \nAffairs Service (NAS) estimated as far back as 2000 that nearly 200 \ntons of cocaine was trafficked through Guatemala, only 16 percent of this annual amount was seized by local authorities over the course of the \npast decade.   By 2010, the estimate of the amount of cocaine trafficked \nthrough Guatemala en route to Mexico and the United States each year \nhad jumped to between 250 and 300 tons,\n176 an increase of 50 to 100 \ntons per year in the last decade. In contrast, the amount of cocaine seized in 2009\u20145.8 tons (5,860 kilos)\u2014is only 58.6 percent of what was seized \nin 1999. That signifies that more cocaine is passing through Guatemala, \nbut smaller amounts are being seized. For example, for every 10 kilos \nseized in 1999, only six were seized in 2009. According to government \nstatistics, half the amount seized in the first six months of 2011 was in the \nhands of the Zetas.\n177 Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 187 |Changes in the composition of organized crime\u2014their alliances as \nwell as their enemies\u2014along with changes in the counter-narcotics \npolicies and the security forces that confront OC help explain the \nincreased trafficking of drugs and its effects on Guatemala.\nPresident Colom has claimed that of the 6,498 violent deaths \nreported in 2009 and the 5,960 reported in 2010 (comparable to a yearly \naverage of 5,500 during the armed conflict) 41 percent are linked to \ndrug trafficking, either large-scale distribution or small-scale sales. The increase in violence in Guatemala is the result, in part, of organized \ncriminal groups using drugs as currency to pay for transportation and \nprotection.  These drugs are subsequently sold in local markets. Colom \nsays that 27 percent of crime is associated with narcomenudeo, or the retail \nsale of drugs for local consumption, not distribution.\n178  Analysts believe \nthat the revenue from the sale of these drugs serves to put more guns in the streets.\nAt least until August 2010, Guatemalan police investigations of DTO \nactivities were disproportionately focused on the retail sale of illegal drugs \n(narcomenudeo ) and not on the massive quantities of drugs that transit \nthe country. Minister Menocal says that 90 percent of cocaine being trafficked through Guatemala continues on to Mexico and the United States, and the rest remains in the country.\n179  Cases of narcomenudeo  take \nup most of the time of the counter-narcotics police, even though smaller \nquantities of drugs are involved. Nearly two-thirds of the investigations \ncarried out by this counter-drug unit are related to small-scale drug \ndistribution.180 As of August 2010, this unit had approximately 600 \nstaff members, of which less than 16 percent carried out investigations. Public Ministry investigations are under-staffed and rely in part on the \npolice and military intelligence for information.  This takes place even \nwhen issues of trust develop, raising the specter of infiltrations of the \ninvestigating team.\n181 \nMapping Organized Crime\nThe first requirement for mapping organized crime in Guatemala is to throw away the old maps. The players and their modus operandi \nhave changed dramatically in the last ten years, and even since 2009. Julie L\u00f3pez| 188 |These changes are closely related to changes in the Mexican cartels, \nwhich pocket at least US$6 billion a year for moving drugs through the \nterritory they control in Guatemala alone.182 In Guatemala, few alliances \nare clear-cut.  Some distribution and smuggling routes cut across the same territory, which can be shared by two or more groups as long as \nthey do not interfere with each other\u2019s routes.\nIn June 2011, Interior Minister Menocal said that seven organized \ncriminal groups operate in Guatemala.\n183 Of these seven, two stand out \nas historical anchors: the Lorenzanas in the eastern area of Zacapa, and \nthe Mendozas in Izabal and Pet\u00e9n, northeastern Guatemala.184 Over the \nyears, both of these criminal groups have remained fixtures in Guatemala, despite changes in other OC networks around them. For instance, in \nthe 1990s, Jorge Mario Paredes C\u00f3rdova operated on Mendozas\u2019 turf \n(which was linked to Mexico\u2019s Gulf Cartel), but Paredes also had some \nassociations with the Lorenzanas (who have been linked mostly to the \nMexican Sinaloa Cartel). According to the DEA, Paredes also received \ndrugs from the remnants of Colombia\u2019s Norte del Valle Cartel (which rose to power after the Cali and Medell\u00edn cartels were dismantled. \nThe DEA alleges that Paredes had taken over from Otto Herrera, \nwho had ties to the Lorenzanas between 1990 and 2003.\n185 Herrera fled \nGuatemala and went to Mexico, where he was arrested in 2004. Herrera \nescaped from a Mexican jail one year later, and then was recaptured in \nColombia in 2007. In 2008, he was extradited to the United States.   \nIn 2005, Paredes\u2019 DTO is said to have changed its modus operandi. \nTogether with other accomplices, his DTO began trafficking along the \nPacific coast from Panama directly to Mexico\u2014usually a Sinaloa Cartel \nroute. His case file (03CR987) in the Southern District Court of New York documents that he made frequent trips to Panama and Mexico. \nHowever, by 2007, Paredes had established himself in San Pedro Sula, \nHonduras, where, by his own account, he delved into real estate. \nLike the Lorenzanas, Paredes was privately regarded by public officials \nin Guatemala as a drug trafficker, but they never brought charges against \nhim.  Guatemalan authorities pursued Paredes for years following his \nSeptember 2003 indictment in the Southern District Court of New York, but it took until 2006 for a Guatemalan court to issue an arrest \nwarrant for him.  On May 1, 2008, Paredes was arrested in Honduras, \nturned over to the DEA by Honduran authorities, and flown to the Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 189 |United States, where he was tried, convicted in 2009, and sentenced \nto 31 years\u2019 imprisonment in April 2010. Other defendants in the same \ncase were arrested in Illinois and New York, as well as in Mexico and \nColombia.\nOne day after his arrest, Paredes admitted to a DEA agent that he had \ncontact with Juan Jos\u00e9 Juancho  Le\u00f3n (gunned down by the Zetas five \nweeks earlier). Paredes said that Juancho  and Otoniel \u201cOtto\u201d( also known \nas El Loco ) Turcios Marroqu\u00edn186\u2014 also indicted by the New York court \nbut for whom no arrest warrant was issued in Guatemala\u2014gave him \nlarge amounts of cash in dollars to buy property in Antigua Guatemala \nand Alta Verapaz, respectively. Paredes told the DEA that he \u201csuspected\u201d \nthat the money might have come from profits from drug trafficking, \nbut had not asked any questions.187 The office of the counter-narcotics \nprosecutor in Guatemala was aware of a \u201csmall Turcios group\u201d in Alta \nVerapaz, but did not investigate Turcios.188 His brother, Isa\u00edas \u201cLico\u201d \nTurcios was arrested in Chicago in June 2004 and given a nine-year prison sentence for drug trafficking in 2005, as part of the Paredes case.\n189\nUntil at least mid-2007 it was possible to distinguish between the \nGulf Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. This is no longer the case. In 2007, the Gulf Cartel still relied on the Zetas for its hit men and \nbodyguards. The Zetas were trusted to guard territory and routes that \nthe Gulf Cartel controlled in Mexico and Guatemala. On Guatemalan \nsoil there was a corridor from Huehuetenango (on the border with \nMexico), stretching from west to east through Quich\u00e9 (where a Zeta \ntraining camp was discovered in March 2009), Alta Verapaz, and Izabal, and heading southeast to Zacapa. This corridor allowed access \nby land to drugs coming from Honduras or by boat once they reached \nthe Guatemalan Atlantic coast.\n190 The drugs could then be transported \ndirectly to Mexico.\nInformation (including flight records) from the office of the counter-\nnarcotics prosecutor in Guatemala indicates that the Zetas began \nentering Huehuetenango by land sometime in 2007, flying from there \nto Alta Verapaz, and proceeding by land to other parts of the country. \nHonduran and Mexican military intelligence determined that the Zetas \nhad established a cell or a \u201cplaza\u201d (a post) in Alta Verapaz and had gone to Zacapa\u2014with the Lorenzanas consent\u2014to kill Juancho  in revenge \nfor his having ambushed and killed two Zetas in Honduras, and having Julie L\u00f3pez| 190 |stolen drugs from them.  Juancho  was known for his \u201c tumbes \u201d (a slang \nterm for stealing drug shipments) from other criminal groups and re-\nselling them. The Zetas reportedly received advice on logistical matters \nfrom a former top officer in Guatemala\u2019s military high command and \nfrom \u201cOtto\u201d Turcios.\nOne Public Ministry investigator concluded that the Zetas may \nhave made a working pact with the Overdick family in Alta Verapaz, a \nsmall but influential DTO led by Hearst Walter Overdick. At the same time, the Zetas managed to keep an amicable distance with both the \nLorenzanas and the Mendozas. \u201cIt appears they have an understanding \nto let each other work in peace and not sabotage each other\u2019s routes,\u201d the \ninvestigator said.\n191\nMeanwhile, a BBC Mundo report published a map credited to the \nresearch organization Stratfor, showing that the Sinaloa Cartel established a route along Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast that extends across the border into \nSan Marcos, Guatemala.\n192 The Sinaloa Cartel had ties to Juan Alberto \nOrtiz L\u00f3pez (also known as Chamal\u00e9 or Hermano Juan, Brother Juan) \nand Mauro Salom\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez, two men from the San Marcos area who \nwere significant cocaine traffickers and poppy cultivators.193 Ram\u00edrez \nis the same suspect who escaped the police surveillance operation that \nattempted his arrest on September 15, 2010, at the Tikal Futura Mall in \nGuatemala City. He was arrested two weeks later near the south coast.\nChamal\u00e9, arrested on March 30, 2011, in a military and police \noperation with DEA support, organized fishermen in canoes to retrieve \ndrug packages unloaded from Colombian boats along San Marcos\u2019 \nPacific coast. Ram\u00edrez started out working for Chamal\u00e9, but eventually established his own DTO and became a competitor.  Ram\u00edrez\u2019s nickname, \n\u201cLe\u00f3n del Mar\u201d (Sea Lion), reportedly was coined when he saved two \nColombians on the high seas; as compensation, they made him their \nbusiness partner. This turn of events allowed Ram\u00edrez to stand up to \nChamal\u00e9. As his indictment in the Tampa district court details, Ram\u00edrez \nwas also involved in sending drug shipments to the United States along \nthe Atlantic coast (a typical Gulf cartel route). The same Tampa court requested Chamal\u00e9\u2019s arrest and extradition on similar grounds.\nRam\u00edrez is considered by the United States to be an important \npiece of the organized crime puzzle in Guatemala, although he was \nless significant than Chamal\u00e9. Ambassador McFarland said that, \u201cThe Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 191 |amount of money and the vehicles that were seized when [Ram\u00edrez] \nwas arrested gave some indication that he was an important figure.\u201d \nThe nearly US$2.3 million seized from Ram\u00edrez in a single weekend \nsurpassed the amount of drug money seized in all of 2009 (US$1.5 \nmillion).194 An arrest warrant was issued for Ram\u00edrez in 2009, one year \nbefore he was captured.\nIn an interview, Interior Minister Menocal said that during the first \neight months of 2010, 545 million poppy plants were seized, mostly in San Marcos, from territory controlled by the Sinaloa cartel. Although \nGuatemala has surpassed Colombia as the \u201csecond highest [heroin] \nproducer in the region,\u201d it remains well behind Mexico.\n195 This change \nis not reflected in the 2010 INCSR, which identifies Guatemala as a \u201cminor producer of poppy and opium derivatives for export.\u201d The report \nindicates that Mexican cartels provide seed and guarantee purchase of \nopium latex and morphine base from producers in Guatemala.\n196\nBy June 11, 2011, Minister Menocal reported that 753.3 million \npoppy plants had been seized in the first five months of the year.  Since the beginning of Colom\u2019s administration in 2008, authorities seized \na total of 2,270.4 million poppy plants, an amount at least double the \nseizures between the eleven years between 1996 and 2007. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t \nseized this many plants, Guatemala would be the second poppy producer \nin the world after Afghanistan,\u201d Menocal stated.\n197\nMinister Menocal\u2019s conclusion that local growers worked with both \nthe Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel in Huehuetenango is shared by the U.S. Embassy. \u201cMy understanding is that [Ram\u00edrez\u2019s] group as well as the \nothers, had dealings with everybody,\u201d said Ambassador McFarland.\n198 \nPolitical analyst Rosada explained that Ram\u00edrez\u2019s organization played \na crucial role amongst Guatemala\u2019s criminal networks. Ram\u00edrez worked as a go-between with others to pass on information, or even to provide \ndrugs when another organization\u2019s supply runs dry. \u201cThat\u2019s why you \ncan\u2019t take maps at face value,\u201d Rosada warned. \u201cMore than territories, \none must think in terms of route protection.\u201d\n199 This would explain the \napparent ambivalence regarding the choice made by Ram\u00edrez, Ortiz, and Paredes to traffic along both the Pacific and the Atlantic coasts. \nThe Pacific has traditionally been Sinaloa Cartel turf, but Ram\u00edrez \nwas indicted in 2009 in a U.S. District Court in Tampa, in the Middle \nDistrict of Florida. This indictment means that Ram\u00edrez had to take Julie L\u00f3pez| 192 |or send drugs to that jurisdiction through Atlantic waters, and plunge \ninto the Mexican Gulf which is a natural Gulf Cartel area. One reason \nfor the change could have been that the Atlantic waters offered greater \ntrafficking opportunities due to increased surveillance along the Sinaloa \nCartel\u2019s Pacific routes beginning in 2009.  \nAccording to intelligence gathered by radar by the DEA and shared \nwith Guatemalan government officials, in 2009 there was a shift in the \ndestination of narco-flights. Instead of landing on Guatemala\u2019s southern coast, most began to land in Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and \nHaiti after the 2010 earthquake. The change in the flights\u2019 destination \ncould have prompted the use of alternative trafficking routes from \nHonduras to Tampa by boat, or by land from Honduras to Guatemala\u2019s \nAtlantic coast, and then from there to Florida by boat, or from Guatemala \nto inland Mexico and onto the Mexican Gulf, and eventually to Tampa. \nThe fact that at least one airplane was recovered in Suchitep\u00e9quez in \nsouthwestern Guatemala in June 2010 suggests that the Sinaloa Cartel was still active there at the time. This is the same case in which three \nMexicans and four Guatemalans were arrested after the plane was seized; \nthey were identified as members of the cartel by Guatemalan authorities, \nonly to be released weeks later despite the seizure of 124 packages of \ncocaine. This case marked a turning point:  prior to it, both the press \nand the special prosecutor for counter-narcotics spoke mostly about the Zetas and made only passing mention of the Sinaloa Cartel. Ambassador \nMcFarland said that one explanation for that \u201cis that some people, when \nthey see or read about a Mexican group, assume it\u2019s the Zetas.\u201d The \ndiplomat revealed that both groups are active in Guatemala, and their \npresence has grown over the past several years.\n200\nIn 2007, the Zetas began to operate in a more independent fashion \nfrom the Gulf Cartel, but still remained within the same DTO. During \nthis period the Zetas entered Guatemala and killed Juancho ; 14 members \nof the Zetas (Mexicans and Guatemalans) were arrested in the months subsequent to his murder.  They were convicted in 2010 and given \nprison sentences that ranged from 8 to 313 years. The Mexican detainees \npossessed illegal Guatemalan identification cards that allegedly had been \nprovided to them by officials in municipalities in southern Guatemala. One of those convicted is a Mexican citizen, Daniel \u201cEl Cachetes\u201d \n(Cheeks) P\u00e9rez Rojas, who the authorities regarded as the Zetas\u2019 leader Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 193 |in Guatemala. Others speculate that the Zetas have another leader who \noperates with complete anonymity.\nIn November 2008, the Zetas, whose presence was growing \nthroughout the country, attempted to ambush a Guatemalan drug lord \nin Huehuetenango who had ties to the Sinaloa Cartel. The ambush \nresulted in 17 deaths, six more than during the incident in which Juancho  \nwas killed in Zacapa. Several arrests were made. Eyewitnesses described how heavily armed Mexican men fled the scene in helicopters. Mauro Guzm\u00e1n, a member of Congress from Huehuetenango, says that the \nSinaloa Cartel dominates the area.\n201 In contrast, the office of the special \nprosecutor for counter-narcotics contends that the Zetas dominate the northern part of Huehuetenango and use it as their main entry point into \nGuatemala.\n202\nBy mid-2009, Special Prosecutor for Counter-narcotics Leonel Ruiz \nsaid that the Zetas\u2019 stronghold was Alta Verapaz, but that they operated \nin 75 percent of the country.203  President Colom also acknowledged that \nthe Zetas have \u201cstrong presence\u201d in Alta Verapaz.204 \nAfter Juancho \u2019s murder, authorities traced the steps of a group of Zetas \nbetween December 2007 and March 2008. It was discovered that one \nman had stayed at the Pan American Hotel in Zone 1 of Guatemala \nCity, two blocks away from the National Palace and the presidential \nresidence, while another stayed in the Intercontinental Hotel in Zone \n10, proving Ruiz\u2019s point about the ease with which they moved around \nin Guatemala. Their visit to the capital was linked to the purchase of vehicles in Zone 10, and the rental of two houses in Zone 18 to plan \nJuancho \u2019s assassination, according to the Public Ministry investigation. In \ntracing their movements, prosecutors discovered that the Zetas are able to move with ease and keep a low profile in most of the country.\nIn 2009, the prosecutor\u2019s office estimated there were between 300 \nand 500 Zetas in Guatemala, one third of whom were Mexican. By \n2010, military and police intelligence sources estimated the total number at 800, with the same ratio between Guatemalan and Mexican members. \nThe final severing of the ties between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel \nin 2010 could have contributed to the Zetas\u2019 increased presence in \nGuatemala. By that time, Heriberto \u201cEl Lazca\u201d Lazcano Lazcano had \nbecome the Zetas\u2019 leader in Mexico, and his second in command was \nMiguel Trevi\u00f1o Morales, a.k.a. Zeta 40 or Comandante  Forty. Julie L\u00f3pez| 194 |The Mexican press reports that the split between the Zetas and the \nGulf Cartel was prompted by the January 10, 2010, assassination of one \nof Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s close associates, V\u00edctor Pe\u00f1a Mendoza (also known as El \nConcord 3). The hit on Pe\u00f1a reportedly was ordered by Eduardo \u201cEl \nCoss\u201d Costilla, the security chief of the Gulf Cartel. This cartel was led \nby Antonio Ezequiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n (also known as Tony Tormenta) \nuntil he was killed on November 5, 2010.205 Trevi\u00f1o had demanded \nthat his associate\u2019s killer be turned over to him; when El Coss refused, Trevi\u00f1o and \u201cEl Lazca\u201d declared war on the Gulf Cartel\n206 and allegedly \ntook control of their plazas, including Guatemala.\nTrevi\u00f1o is a deserter from the Mexican army\u2019s elite Airborne Special \nForces Group (known by its acronym, GAFE) that was also trained to conduct counter-narcotics operations. Initially, he was in charge of the \nGulf cartel plazas  in Nuevo Laredo and Veracruz, Mexico. According \nto a retired U.S. federal agent, Trevi\u00f1o later established himself as head of the Zeta organization in Guatemala, settling in Alta Verapaz and locating his headquarters there.  In Alta Verapaz, one of his main \nlocal contacts was \u201cEl Loco\u201d Turcios). Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s presence in Guatemala \nwas also confirmed by a top executive branch official who claimed that \nthe Zeta 40 \u201cwas the number one Zeta in Guatemala\u201d and that he was \n\u201calmost arrested\u201d in a February 2010 police and military operation.\n207 \nThe Mexican press reported that Trevi\u00f1o also escaped a shootout with \nthe police in Tamaulipas in April 2010 and evaded authorities altogether \nin Puebla and Veracruz, in October of the same year.208\nOn another front, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of \nForeign Assets Control (OFAC) has linked the Lorenzana family to \nthe Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s leader, Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n209\u2014despite \nunofficial information also linking the Lorenzanas to the Gulf cartel. The Lorenzanas\u2019 operations included the transportation of drugs from \nEl Salvador to Guatemala by go-fast boats, as recorded in a Guatemalan \npress report that quotes an indictment describing operations from 1990 \nto 2003. OFAC also traced operations between Colombians and the \nSinaloa Cartel, with the Lorenzanas as a vital link for the transport of \ncocaine to Guatemala\u2019s north coast, a typical Gulf Cartel route in more recent years.\n210\nMexican press accounts, citing the DEA, indicate that the Zetas\u2019 \nconsolidation as an independent group has led to alliances between the Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 195 |Sinaloa and Gulf cartels\u2019 structures. The Lorenzanas\u2019 position vis-\u00e1-vis \nthese new alliances is still unclear, particularly after the April 2011 arrest \nof their patriarch, Waldemar Lorenzana Lima. Will the Lorenzanas \nremain loyal to the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels? Or, will the Lorenzanas \nchoose to be loyal to the Zetas, the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels\u2019 rivals? \nAccording to the Public Ministry, it is still unclear whether the Zetas \nwill demand 100 percent loyalty from the Lorenzanas, or will see them \nas a liability due to their partnership with the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels. Several questions remain: Will the equilibrium between the Lorenzanas \nand Mexican cartels last in Zacapa? What role will the Mendozas play in \nPet\u00e9n and Izabal? And, will there be a large scale dispute for territorial \ncontrol between the Zetas and the Sinaloa-Gulf alliance like in Mexico? \nOne key element is whether the Gulf Cartel will maintain its \nstrength after the death of its leader, Ezequiel C\u00e1rdenas, in November \n2010.  Questions also abound regarding the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s strength in Guatemala given the arrests of three of its most important associates: \nRam\u00edrez, Ort\u00edz and Lorenzana,\n211 and whether or not \u201cEl Chapo\u201d \nGuzm\u00e1n\u2019s alleged presence in Guatemala\u2014as suggested by Minister Menocal to the Mexican magazine Proceso  and confirmed by President \nColom\n212\u2014 means that his associates are receiving additional support \nfrom the main Sinaloa structure. \nSo far, the Zetas have demonstrated no restraint in conveying the \nmessage that crossing them\u2014whether by stealing or seizing their drug shipments and/or killing their leaders\u2014 will result in quick \nretribution in Mexico or Guatemala. The strength of the Guatemalan \nSinaloa structure is bound to decline; this could tip the balance in \nfavor of the Zetas, depending on whether Guatemalan security forces target key Zeta players. Among the 74 Zeta suspects arrested between \n2010 and 2011 were 11 Mexicans, 2 Hondurans, 1 Nicaraguan; the \nrest are Guatemalans. Yet, none has surfaced as a key player in the \norganization. Rather, they so far have been identified as hit men, \nenforcers, or body guards.\nZeta leader Trevi\u00f1o\u2019s name is still to be mentioned in public by \nthe authorities. Up until April 2011, the Public Ministry had not acknowledged his presence in the country, despite the assertion by an \nexecutive branch official that an attempt to arrest Trevi\u00f1o had failed. \nThis may suggest that military forces acted alone in attempting to arrest Julie L\u00f3pez| 196 |him. There is an international arrest warrant for Trevi\u00f1o stemming \nfrom at least four indictments for homicide in Texas, and one for drug \ntrafficking in New York. If Trevi\u00f1o is arrested in Guatemala, there \ncould be enough legal clout to extradite him to the United States. Both \nTrevi\u00f1o and Lazcano, along with other Zeta members, are the target of \ncoordinated enforcement action by the U.S. Justice, State, and Treasury \nDepartments.213\n\u201cOtto\u201d Turcios was arrested on October 27, 2010, in Belmopan, \nBelize. He was extradited to the United States to be tried before a New York court along with Paredes.\n214 In the meantime, an extradition \nprocess for Ram\u00edrez is underway in Guatemala.  Ram\u00edrez\u2019s lawyers have rejected the charges brought against him by the Tampa court and claim \nthat he is only a plantain grower.\nAlthough Juancho\u2019s killing is also believed to have been an attempt by \nthe Zetas to take over his drug transportation route, information released \nby local authorities indicates that the Zetas were unsuccessful. Juancho\u2019s  \nroute allegedly was taken over by Yovani Espa\u00f1a. Intelligence sources \nhave revealed that the Lorenzanas gave Juancho  permission to operate in \nZacapa, and Espa\u00f1a had inherited that concession. Espa\u00f1a was gunned down and killed in late June 2010.\nPress accounts indicate that Espa\u00f1a was replaced by Esduin Javier, the \nlegal representative of a construction company that was owned by Espa\u00f1a \nand that had US$7 million worth of contracts with the government. \nJavier was ambushed by unidentified armed men in September 2010 but survived the attack. The PNC has investigated Javier in connection with \nEspa\u00f1a\u2019s death and for possible links with organized crime and money \nlaundering activities. Javier was arrested both after Espa\u00f1a\u2019s murder and \nafter his September 2010 attack, but on both occasions was promptly \nreleased due to lack of evidence\u2014even though in the latter case he was \ncarrying heavy weaponry that is unauthorized for civilian use.\n215\nOther press reports indicate that Espa\u00f1a was killed over a drug shipment \nhe allegedly stole from the Zetas. However, the Zetas presumably did not recover the drugs until several months later, when a caravan of some 20 \nvehicles loaded with an estimated 60 people entered the Pet\u00e9n in search \nof the shipment. The caravan arrived at a property belonging to Espa\u00f1a\u2019s \nwidow in El Naranjo, and the drugs were allegedly recovered. During \nthe course of the operation, the caravan lost its way, accidentally detoured Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 197 |to the Mayan Tikal Park, and engaged in gunfire with the police and the \narmy, after having identified themselves as \u201cZetas\u201d and firing warning \nshots. Authorities arrested two men and seized 11 vehicles, one of which \ncontained two male corpses which are as yet to be identified. The rest \nof the caravan continued on to the west toward Mexico,216 a country \nsharing some 700 unofficial border crossings with Guatemala.\nA top administration official in Guatemala has said that the caravan \ncame through Belize and entered Pet\u00e9n in early October, reaching the El Naranjo property from east to west. Some three weeks later, \u201cOtto\u201d \nTurcios was arrested in Belmopan, Belize. His purported links to the \nZetas could indicate that he facilitated part of the operation. Turcios \nowns at least one transportation company and is familiar with the Belize-Guatemala border area.\nMilitary and civilian intelligence information suggests that a new capo  \nfrom Mexico is coming to Guatemala to establish order, and that the \nLorenzanas are being harassed to force them to lower their profile and \nenthrone this yet unknown drug baron.\n217 This new capo  has reportedly \nbeen profiled as the main coordinator of all the Mexican cartels in \nGuatemala and could foreshadow efforts to target the Mendozas to \nconfirm the dominance of Mexican cartels in Guatemala. \nIn April 2010, the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control \nadded the Lorenzanas to its list of Specially Designated Narcotics \nTraffickers under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act . The \nwarrants for their arrest and extradition are being legally disputed by \nthe defendants\u2019 attorneys,218 even after Waldemar Lorenzana Lima was \ncaptured. Arrest warrants are still pending for his sons Haroldo, Eli\u00fa and \nWaldemar Lorenzana Cord\u00f3n, as well as for Carlos Andr\u00e9s Alvarenga \nMej\u00eda (the husband of one of the Lorenzana sisters) and Gonzalo L\u00f3pez \nCabrera, who were in charge of local operations and drug transportation \nfrom El Salvador to Guatemala ten years ago.219 \nAnalyst Rosada explains that the premise that a cartel occupies a \nspecific zone is no longer applicable. \u201cThese are zones of transshipment and mobilization that can be used by several actors linked with the same \ncartel,\u201d he says. \u201cThe traffickers\u2019 job is to protect the transshipment, \ntheir warehouses, and to generate secure conditions to move the drugs \ntoward the U.S. border.\u201d\n220Julie L\u00f3pez| 198 |Rosada has warned that maps indicating areas dominated by certain \ncartels are tricky because they allow only a broad, general view of the \nsituation and complicate a more nuanced understanding. For instance, \nthe \u201cboss\u201d who controls a territory can grant permission or right \nof way, as long as a division of routes has been previously established \nand is respected. Rosada explained that transshipment by other groups \nare permitted in the zone traditionally used by the Gulf Cartel. \u201cThis \ndoesn\u2019t mean that the main hegemonic presence isn\u2019t the Sinaloa or the Gulf Cartel, but moving drugs is complicated, so a number of situations \narise in a territory that seemed rock-solid and then becomes porous, and \nother people get through.\u201d\n221 \nThe Cocaine Flights\nThe number of narco-flights from different areas in Colombia to Guatemala declined considerably between 2008 and May 2010, \nas shown on maps that display aerial routes from South to Central \nAmerica. These maps display the number of flights made by cocaine-\nladen planes, and they were produced with radar intelligence gathered \nby the DEA, according to an administration official working with the \nMinistry of Interior.\n222\nPresident Colom said that in 2008, between 30 and 40 planes loaded \nwith cocaine landed in Guatemala, each one carrying from 300 to 500 kilos of drugs.\n223 A conservative estimate would indicate that nearly 9 \ntons of cocaine were transported to the country by air alone. Additional information released by Minister Menocal indicates that that same year a \ntotal of 68 planes landed in Central America, while another 80 landed in \nthe Dominican Republic.\n224\nUntil the end of 2008, the small planes landed mostly in the \nLaguna del Tigre area on the northwestern border of Guatemalan with Mexico, close to the central-western border with Mexico (the Franja \nTransversal del Norte, FTN) and along the southwestern coast. The \nmaps displaying the flights\u2019 information show clusters of planes landing \nin Pet\u00e9n and on the southern coast of Guatemala. A few also landed \non Honduras\u2019 northeastern coast bordering Nicaragua, and along \nNicaragua\u2019s northern coast.Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 199 |The 2009 map indicates that 61 clandestine flights landed in Central \nAmerica, most of them on Honduras\u2019 Atlantic coast, a few in Nicaragua, \nand 12 in Guatemala (4 on the southern coast and 8 in Pet\u00e9n). However, \nin 2011, Minister Menocal showed what he described as a DEA map \nindicating that at least 92 flights were bound for Honduras in 2009.225 \nPresident Colom explained that after the army was sent back to patrol the Pet\u00e9n area, the problem shifted to Honduras. \u201cNow the planes land \nin Honduras and the drugs are transported to Guatemala by land,\u201d he \nsaid.\n226 There are some 400 unofficial crossing points between Honduras \nand Guatemala, according to Minister Menocal.227\nBetween January and May 2010, a total of 77 flights were detected \nbetween Colombia and Central America. Of these, Ministry of Interior maps suggest that 21 flights landing in Haiti, which may have been the \nresult of traffickers\u2019 capitalizing on the January 2010 Haiti earthquake \nand the chaotic conditions that followed. Only 3 flights landed in \nGuatemala (two in Pet\u00e9n, one on the south coast). Of the remaining 53 \nflights, most landed in Honduras (perhaps the effect of political changes \nin Honduras\u2019 security systems) and just a few went to Nicaragua. \nA Ministry of Interior official revealed that both the Zetas and \nthe Sinaloa Cartel transport drugs by plane from South America to Honduras, and use Nicaragua as a safe place to store drug money. \nA prosecutor in the Special Office for Counter-narcotics Prosecutions \nsaid that fewer narco-flights are detected in Honduras. \u201cThey don\u2019t have \ntoo many controls over there,\u201d he maintained. \u201cThe entry points are \nunder less strict surveillance.\u201d\n228 \nPress reports disclosed information about a narco-flight that landed in \nJune 2010 along Guatemala\u2019s southern coast and about another flight in October 2010 that crashed in Costa Rica after taking off from San Jos\u00e9 \nwith 173 kilos of cocaine and two Guatemalan passengers on board. \nThe Strategic Studies Institute report from May 2010 indicated \nthat Guatemala had 490 clandestine landing strips.\n229 Interior Minister \nMenocal considers this number to be an \u201cexaggeration\u201d and claims that the number of flights detected is inconsistent with such a high number \nof landing strips. He does not rule out the possibility that the landing \nstrips might exist and have not been used.\n230 Special Counter-narcotics \nProsecutor Esteban Garc\u00eda said in August 2010 that surveillance flights between May and June of that year located 15 clandestine landing strips, Julie L\u00f3pez| 200 |mostly in Pet\u00e9n, and 13 were destroyed.231 Others were spotted in Izabal, \nwhere in early August 2010, in the village of El Cej\u00e1, authorities arrested \na man in possession of US$45,000, the origin of which he could not \nexplain. A landing strip on his property is believed to have been used for \nnarco-flights.\nOther counter-narcotics detectives believe that the reported number \nof landing strips\u2014and their destruction\u2014is irrelevant because organized \ncrime groups have been landing planes on paved roads since 2004. Additionally, there are alternatives to air transportation. \nIn 2010, two submarine-type vessels were seized on the Pacific coast; \nfour Colombians and one Costa Rican were arrested as a result of these \noperations. The Public Ministry estimates that each of these vessels had \na capacity for at least five tons of drugs. In the last four years, according \nto information released by Minister Menocal, at least 600 submarines \nhave been traced by U.S. government agencies leaving South American coasts, bound for the Pacific or Atlantic coasts of Central America and \nthe Caribbean.\n232\n\u201cGo-fast\u201d boats also are used to transport large amounts of drugs to \nboth the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Guatemala. And according to the 2010 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), \n\u201cland transit of cocaine and heroin from Colombia is typically along \nthe Pan-American Highway,\u201d and \u201cmost land transit consists of drugs \ncarried in the luggage of a commercial bus, or in hidden compartments \nof commercial tractor-trailers traveling to Guatemala.\u201d\n233 \nIn 2011, Guatemalan authorities, including Minister Menocal, noted \na new trend, involving the smuggling of smaller amounts of drugs, as \nsuggested by the seizure of a 40-kilo load in early June. The unofficial \ncrossings between Guatemala and Honduras and between Guatemala \nand El Salvador (nearly 200) play a key role in this context.234\nSmall amounts of heroin have also been seized. Official police \nstatistics indicate that only five kilos of heroin were seized between 2008 \nand 2009, compared with none between January and August of 2010.Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 201 |Methamphetamines \nOne former director of the counter-narcotics police said that the \ninvestigations into pseudoephedrine trafficking and methamphetamine \nproduction usually go nowhere as there are no trails to follow.235 The \ndetective says the names and addresses of senders and recipients on the \nseized shipments are fake. No one claims the shipments, which are \nusually seized in the cargo area of La Aurora International Airport in \nGuatemala City.\nFor instance, no suspects have been apprehended in the 26 cases \nregistered between October 2007 and May 2010. In 12 of these cases, the sending address was in Bangladesh; the remaining senders were from \nSingapore, India, Paraguay, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Honduras, \nBelize, and Sweden. A Public Ministry investigator explained that the \nother countries are usually detours (from Bangladesh) for the shipments \ndestined for Guatemala. The detective said that the difficulty in establishing working links with Bangladeshi authorities has been a major \nroadblock in following the trail of the drugs.\n\u201cSo far, there has only been one case in which we identified those \nsuspected of running a lab designed to isolate the (pseudoephedrine) \ncomponent from other ingredients in imported medicines,\u201d says a \nPublic Ministry official. \u201cThe case dates back from February 2009. One \nGuatemalan and one Mexican, with an arrest warrant in Mexico on drug charges, remain at large.\u201d\n236\nOn June 11, 2011, authorities discovered a lab that was used to \nproduce synthetic drugs (Ecstasy and meth) in Pajapita, San Marcos, a \nfew kilometers from the border with Mexico. No one was found at the \nproperty, but prosecutor Brenda Mu\u00f1oz said that the case represented the \nfirst time a lab like this had been discovered. Previously, only warehouses \ncontaining basic components or the finished product had been found. \nSome press reports indicate that the value of the drug components and \nequipment seized amounted to US$390,000. Others quote the value as US$7 million.\n237\nThe office of the special prosecutor for counter-narcotics revealed \nthat there were more cases involving synthetic drugs before July 2009. \nAfter that, a new law regulating the contents of pharmaceuticals, which Julie L\u00f3pez| 202 |established pseudoephedrine as an illegal component, helped reduce the \nnumber of cases.\nIn 2009, authorities seized 22.6 million tablets of pseudoephedrine \nvalued at Q340 million (US$42.5 million). Between January and \nAugust 2010, they seized 1.3 million tablets valued at Q19.8 million \n(US$2.4 million). Based on these statistics, each tablet would cost Q15 \n(US$1.80). However, according to the Public Ministry, once the drug is \nprocessed and methamphetamine is produced, each tablet can cost up to Q200 (US$25). The cost alone, the investigators say, indicates that the \nlocal market is not the target and that most of the drugs are intended for \nMexico, the United States, and Europe.\nMexican Ambassador to Guatemala Eduardo Ibarrola said that the \nstrengthening of Guatemala\u2019s legislation to combat meth is good news. \n\u201cWe have a very intense working relationship with Guatemala in terms \nof cooperation,\u201d Ibarrola says. \u201cThere is information exchange, but we must double our efforts.\u201d\n238\nDespite assertions by the police that the shipments are hard to trace, \nInterior Minister Menocal has said that one of the Zetas arrested in \nOctober 2010 is the brother of a leader in the meth business, but he \ncould not identify him with any cartel in particular.239\nIn December 2008, the DEA released a report indicating that \nthe Gulf Cartel was responsible for transporting multiple tons of \nmethamphetamine, among other drugs, from Colombia, Guatemala, \nPanama, and Mexico to the United States, and for distributing the drugs \non U.S. soil.240 However, given the severed ties between the Gulf Cartel \nand the Zetas in January 2010 and the Zetas\u2019 control over old Gulf Cartel positions in Guatemala, it is possible that\u2014as Minister Menocal \nnoted\u2014 the Zetas have taken over at least part of the methamphetamine \ntransportation business through the country. \n241\nPress reports indicate that the Sinaloa Cartel also shares the drug \nbusiness in Central America with smaller organizations like La Familia  \nMichoacana. In Honduras, criminal investigation and counter-\nnarcotics authorities link pseudoephedrine trafficking to the Sinaloa \norganization.242 In January 2011 two Guatemalan men were arrested \nfor producing pseudoephedrine and methamphetamines on behalf of La Familia  and of conspiring to traffic the drugs into Mexico and the United Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 203 |States.243 Also, the meth and Ecstasy lab discovered on June 11, 2011, was \ndiscovered on Sinaloa Cartel turf in San Marcos.\nThe extent of the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s cooperation with the Gulf Cartel \nin Mexico244 will determine whether or not the Sinaloa Cartel supports \nthe Gulf Cartel operations in Guatemala. The 94 percent reduction \nin pseudoephedrine seizures from 2009 to 2010 could be a sign of \nimportant changes within the criminal networks that transport this \ndrug. The reduction could also indicate that fewer trafficking routes \ninclude Guatemala, or\u2014given the June 2011 discovery of the San Marcos \nlab\u2014that the drugs are being smuggled more discretely, making it more \ndifficult for authorities to seize them.\nCause and Effect of Neighboring Organized  \nCrime Activity\nGuatemala\u2019s serious problems with crime are sometimes blamed on its \nproximity to Mexico. Such a conclusion ignores the basic nature of OC \nin Guatemala and places blame only on foreign criminal structures. As \ndiscussed earlier in this paper, OC cannot exist in a void and, like a vine, \nneeds a structure and base on which to develop. \nIn Mexico as in Guatemala and Colombia, the local capos emerged \nfrom local crime and forged alliances with local authorities. Both local \ncapos and local authorities, in turn, expanded their reach via foreign OC \nand served the interests of foreign OC. In Mexico, since the mid-1930s, \nlocal criminal groups forged a business alliance with Mexican municipal \npolice and politicians. In Guatemala during the armed conflict, criminal \nstructures developed alliances with the army. In the postwar period, \nsome criminal structures have sought to expand their contacts to the \npolice while maintaining relations with the military.\nEven if the reach of Mexican OC had not been so extensive, \nGuatemalan OC would have continued to evolve on its own until the mid-1990s, when the presence of Colombian cartels flourished. The \nnature and extent of illegal activities in Guatemala during that decade \nwould have developed in the same manner because most of the main \ncriminal groups were local and home grown, relying, like their Mexican Julie L\u00f3pez| 204 |counterparts, on a partially corrupt government system. The conflict and \npost-conflict dynamics, as well as the nature of civil-military relations, \nwould remain unchanged even if Mexican organized crime were absent \nfrom Guatemala. The criminal conditions were already set, with or \nwithout Mexico\u2019s drug war. \nCriminal activity in neighboring countries did not cause rising \nviolence and crime in Guatemala, but it certainly exacerbated and thrived \non existing crime and violence in the country. Guatemala is situated along an important pathway for human and drug trafficking from South \nto North America, and for the trafficking of weapons and cash from \nNorth to South America. These trafficking routes were bound to have \nan effect on the Central American region, especially in a country such \nas Guatemala where corruption, impunity, and weak state institutions \nfacilitate illegality and thwart the rule of law, in turn furthering local \nand foreign OC activity.\nStrategies to Confront Challenges Posed by \nOrganized Crime\nOne of the strategies in place to fight OC is a collective approach \nthrough the Central American Integration System (known by its Spanish \nacronym, SICA). \u201cIt\u2019s a coherent response, for the first time, in terms of \nsecurity,\u201d says Minister Menocal. One of the benefits of this approach \nis greater continuity in policy; at the time of a presidential transition, \neach country team is to remain the same, with the exception of the \nminister. SICA provides a meeting ground for the sharing of intelligence \nresources, the cross-checking of information, and the mapping of the main OC networks to be targeted in the Central American region.\n245 \n\u201cThe idea of using SICA is that it\u2019s not necessary to create something \nnew; it already exists,\u201d Menocal said.246 In fact, SICA coordinated the \n\u201cInternational Conference in Support of the Central America Security Strategy,\u201d aimed at forging agreement on a 22-point regional security \nplan and at improving donor coordination.  All seven Central American \npresidents, along with senior officials from donor nations, including U.S. \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton,  and multilateral banks participated \nin the meeting.   Although SICA was founded in 1993, the June 2011 Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 205 |meeting represented the first time that the region\u2019s Ministers of Interior \nmet under the SICA umbrella to discuss the region\u2019s security crisis. \nPrevious efforts through the region\u2019s Foreign Relations ministries had \nmostly produced written reports of limited practical value.247 \nAnother component of Guatemala\u2019s strategy involves recovering \nsignificant portions of the country\u2019s territory from OC; this means installing army garrisons and stepping up patrols, not only in the areas \nwhere narcotics and contraband trafficking is prevalent, but also in \nenvironmental reserves where traffickers prey upon protected animal \nspecies as well as precious woods. Minister Menocal said that seven \nmobile military patrols already have been sent to the Pet\u00e9n and the FTN (a trucking route in northwestern Guatemala). \u201cWe are in the process of \nsending more troops, but we still only have two thirds of the number of \nsoldiers that used to guard the area in 2004,\u201d he warned.\n248 The lack of \nsufficient military personnel has become a handicap. The state of siege \nin Alta Verapaz, for instance, could not be extended simultaneously to \nother areas of the country due to lack of resources, including troops \nand weaponry.249 Nevertheless, a state of siege was declared in the Pet\u00e9n \nin May 2011 following the massacre described in the introduction to this report.  The cost was nearly US$250,000 per day, an amount not \nbudgeted for this purpose.\nThe government had a police force of 25,000 by July 2011, exceeding \ninitial expectations.  However, former Vice President Eduardo Stein has \nnoted that President Colom\u2019s efforts to build-up the number of troops \nhas not led to a reduction in violence. The amount of drugs seized is miniscule in comparison to the estimated tons of drugs being transported \nthrough the country en route to Mexico and the United States.  Nor has \nGuatemala\u2019s homicide rate declined significantly (8 percent, according to \nofficial numbers). Nonetheless, Colom maintained that the armed forces \nhave recovered control of the FTN area, and that by the end of 2010, they \nwill have gained complete control of northeast Pet\u00e9n and the Laguna \ndel Tigre area, where planes abandoned by organized crime frequently appear. \nMeanwhile, events in the Pet\u00e9n in October 2010\u2014the Zeta incursion \nthat led to a prolonged shoot-out with the police and army\u2014caused \nthe area to be seen abroad as having turned into no man\u2019s land, into \n\u201cGuatemala\u2019s latest calamity,\u201d according to a McClatchy newspaper Julie L\u00f3pez| 206 |published later that month.250  One Guatemalan counter-narcotics \nprosecutor agreed.  That said, H\u00e9ctor Rosada pointed out that the Pet\u00e9n \nhas been a no man\u2019s land since the 1960s. \u201cFirst the smugglers were there, \nthen the looters looking for precious woods and archeological treasures, \nand now it\u2019s the drug traffickers.\u201d251 In fact, in 2009 the Pet\u00e9n had the \nhighest homicide rate in the country\u201498 per every 100,000 inhabitants, as opposed to the national average of 45 per 100,000.\n252 These numbers \ndid not escalate overnight.\nThe Colom government is aiming for results over the long term; these \nresults will only be possible, however, if current policies and programs are continued.  There are numerous obstacles to continuity, including \nthe limited budget. Overall tax revenues are insufficient to support the \nsecurity as well as other aspects of the budget, yet important sectors of \nGuatemalan society continue to oppose tax reform.  Another problem is that the government sabotages itself and its effort to secure higher taxes \nvia corruption scandals.\nEfforts by the police to recover national territory from organized \ncrime have been expensive. While the Portillo administration trained \n1,250 new police officers and the Berger administration trained 2,500, \nthe Colom administration had trained 6,700 by October 2010. The size \nof the police force has reached 20,000, a level it was projected to reach 10 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s taking Q240 million (US$30 million) to arm, clothe, \nand pay them, and it has taken a toll on the budget,\u201d said Menocal. \u201cWe \nhave reached a limit, financially speaking.\u201d \n253  \nTo increase the force to 50,000\u2014the goal established in the police \nreform proposal\u2014the Guatemalan government would need a minimum annual budget increase for the police alone of Q500 million (some \nUS$62.5 million). \u201cAnd yet, the tendency is to reduce the budget, instead \nof increasing, and punish the police,\u201d said Police Reform Commissioner \nHelen Mack. \u201cWhat we have is a rapid increase in the numbers of police \nwithout the minimum resources that the police need to carry out their mission.\u201d\n254\nFunding problems aside, some changes have been possible due to \nthe presence of the CICIG in Guatemala. In April 2010, when asked \nif he saw Guatemala as a glass half full or half empty, former CICIG \nCommissioner Castresana said that the glass was almost empty, but that \na small corner of the problem had been fixed. \u201cOf 20,000 police officers, Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 207 |the commission works with 100; of 2,300 prosecutors, it\u2019s working with \n16; of nearly 1,500 judges, it\u2019s been working with six,\u201d Castresana said. \n\u201cIf we demonstrate that this corner can work at its finest, that is the \nsample experience that must be reproduced in the rest of the country.\u201d255\nMack still regards the state\u2019s efforts as insufficient. She suggests that \nmore local police officers, investigators, prosecutors, and judges should \nhave been trained by the CICIG, to hone investigative techniques \nincluding the use of scientific evidence and testimonial evidence to \nbuild criminal cases. \u201cThe state has not done its part in learning as \nthese programs progress. The prosecutorial system in particular has \nnot benefited as it should have, because institutional strengthening has \nnot been a priority,\u201d Mack said. Yet, despite the small number of local officials who have been trained by the CICIG, the results have been \nsignificant. Whether this trend will continue will depend on future \nadministrations. \nFor example, despite the initial failed arrest attempt that led to the \nSeptember 15, 2010, shootout at the Tikal Futura Mall, Mauro Salom\u00f3n \nRam\u00edrez\u2019s case led to a landmark arrest. There was coordination between \nthe Interior and Defense Ministries and the Public Ministry.  \u201cThe result was important,\u201d said Colom. \u201cIt was the first operation of this type that \nhad this degree of success without the accompaniment of CICIG. We \ncouldn\u2019t give up; we kept arresting Mauro\u2019s people until we cornered \nhim. This hadn\u2019t happened before. We either arrested a guy for good, \nor he was gone for good. Now there is more capacity for follow-up.\u201d\n256 \nAccording to Minister Menocal, strengthening the criminal investigation \ncapabilities of the police has been the priority to date. \nIn the Ram\u00edrez case, the fact that there was a pending arrest warrant in \na U.S. federal court prompted Guatemalan officials to step up their efforts \nto detain him. This represented a qualitative change in Guatemala. Until \nthen, major drug traffickers tended to be arrested in other countries. \nAs noted by Ambassador McFarland, \u201cExtradition is very important, and we\u2019ve seen it work that way in other countries\u2026We think it could \nwork here, but for it to work you have to have a judicial system that is \nfairly effective, efficient, as well as honest, and we\u2019ll see, but we certainly \nnotice there [is] change since the CICIG came [to Guatemala].\u201d\n257 \nThe model precinct in Villa Nueva, on the outskirts of Guatemala City, has had good results. The U.S. government focused financial and Julie L\u00f3pez| 208 |technical resources in Villa Nueva to train police to arrest entire gangs \nand dismantle their operations. However, there is resistance to change \nwithin the police, and it may not be possible to replicate this program in \nother locations. The U.S. ambassador has recognized that there are no \nguarantees that the results in Villa Nueva will multiply over time. \u201cThe \nmodel precinct has shown results in Villa Nueva,\u201d said McFarland.  \n\u201cWe have encouraged Guatemalans to do the same in Mixco [a precinct near the capital]. It\u2019s a very good program, and it should be \ncopied in the rest of the country [and] in other districts here in the \ncapital. [Yet] there is a certain resistance to it. The other problem \nis  that it requires vetted and trained people in those precincts, and \nthey are in very short supply. We are really pressing the Interior \nMinistry and the police to assign promising new officers to the \nmodel precincts, but there are other people in the police who would \nprefer to send them elsewhere; so it\u2019s a constant back and forth.\u201d\n258\nIn early December 2010, press reports revealed that Ambassador  \nMcFarland managed to persuade Guatemalan authorities to assign \nnew police recruits to the Mixco model precinct and to remove \nofficers accused of corruption, by conditioning a US$1 million grant \non acceptance of these provisions. In a public event on June 7, 2011, \nAmbassador McFarland confirmed that the Mixco precinct had \nsucceeded in reducing violence in the area.\nDespite differences of opinion on how best to reorganize the police, \nU.S. authorities believe that Mack\u2019s appointment to head of the Police Reform Commission was a good decision. Her involvement has brought \ncredibility to the police reform effort. Mack herself has stated that she \nworks for the state and not for any political party, and hopes that any \ngoverning party will adopt the same perspective and continue police \nreform over the long term. The proposed police reform package \nenvisions immediate actions to take place over an eight-month period but is intended to last over a 13-year period and over the course of three \ndifferent administrations.\nThe Colom administration\u2019s strategy for police reform has involved \ntraining new police officers and cleansing the police force as a whole, \nfrom top to bottom. \u201cExpelling two top commanders of the police force Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 209 |and arresting them was a strong blow for the government, but it had to \nbe done,\u201d said Colom. \u201cThe Public Ministry is also working with the \naccompaniment of CICIG, [and without it]. It\u2019s doing its job.\u201d259\nThe ability to penetrate the V\u00e9liz Palomo group illustrates the strides \nthat the Public Ministry has made under the tutelage of the CICIG. In this instance, wiretaps\u2014a tool the legalization of which was pushed \nforward by the CICIG\u2014allowed the Public Ministry to uncover the \nassistant prosecutor who was an accomplice to the suspects. What began \nas an investigation of a local extortion ring led to the dismantling of \na money laundering organization that stretched from Guatemala to \nPanama.\n260 \nThe effort to confront organized crime also includes the promotion of \na National Accord for the Advancement of Security and Justice, signed in April 2009. The Accord has yielded limited results so far, but the Colom \nadministration has argued that long-term results will be forthcoming.  \nThe Accord addresses the fight against corruption and impunity, as well \nas the strengthening of the judicial system and security forces to fight \ncrime more efficiently. \nThe objectives of the Accord address the CICIG\u2019s request for \ncongressional approval of an assets seizure law, due to go into effect in July 2011, and which allows a broader use of assets seized from OC to fight \ncrime; a plea-bargaining law, which allows defendants to testify against \ncrime bosses in exchange for reduced sentences; and, the establishment of \nHigh-Impact Courts, which have more resources in terms of personnel \nand security to try highly-sensitive cases that put judges and prosecutors\u2019 lives at risk. The Accord also provides a space for petitions and proposals \nfrom civil society and the business elite to strengthen laws such as the \nArms and Munitions Law, intended to disarm criminals and limit the \nnumber of guns in the streets; and the Law on Organized Crime, which \nprovides the legal framework for tougher sentences.\nFrom a law-enforcement perspective, previous governments as well as \nthe current one have opted to deploy joint army and police patrols in the streets while more new police officers are being trained and until more \nfunds\u2014local or foreign\u2014become available. This strategy has been both \nhailed and criticized. \nOn the one hand, the army is thought to elicit more respect or fear. \nThis might apply to common criminals but not to individuals with Julie L\u00f3pez| 210 |well-honed criminal careers like the Zetas, whose training, military \nbackground, and weaponry make them a lethal force. On the other \nhand, areas of the country hard-hit by the conflict and by human rights \nviolations perpetrated by the army do not welcome a return of military \npatrols\u2014although Colom has said that in some of these areas crime \nhas increased to the point that communities have asked for the army to \nreturn. \nIn some areas where the police presence is minimal, families have been \nforced to migrate. In Zacapa, for example, eight families left their homes due to the increasing number of homicides and others are also trying to \nrelocate.  Although the deaths are recorded, local police claim that no \none has requested additional security in the area, while residents claim \nthey are afraid to voice their complaints.\n261 There are no official numbers \non how many Guatemalan families have been internally displaced due \nto the violence, a phenomenon that mirrors, albeit it on a more limited \nscale, the internal displacements during the armed conflict. \nFormer Vice President Eduardo Stein has said that the army has not \nbeen as effective as expected in helping to reduce violence. Retired \nColonel M\u00e9rida points out that sending soldiers to \u201cwalk the streets \nalong with the police\u201d represents a misuse of a valuable resource. M\u00e9rida believes that the army should be withdrawn from the streets, retrained, \nand sent on missions to secure the border. Such an approach would \nhave prevented the Zetas from carrying out the attack in Pet\u00e9n in early \nOctober 2010. What happened instead was that some of the soldiers \nwho faced the Zetas\u2019 gunfire allegedly asked to be discharged after the \nshootout because they were so shaken up.\n262\nM\u00e9rida would prefer to see a larger force of at least one thousand \nsoldiers in the FTN area, strategically distributed as during the armed conflict, so that areas patrolled intersect and the whole area is covered. \nThis approach, in fact, allowed for the detection of the first narco-flights. \nAccording to Colom, \u201cthe problem, as always, is the financial \nlimitations,\u201d referring to the funds needed to better train and equip the \narmy and the police and increase their numbers. The lack of resources \nhas limited efforts to expand the investigative capabilities of the police and the justice system. \u201cI would like to have 40 or 50 special prosecutors, \nbut right now we don\u2019t have the kind of money we need for that,\u201d he \nsaid.\n263  In March 2010, at Colom\u2019s request, the U.N. Office on Drugs Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 211 |and Crime (UNODC) signed a memorandum of understanding with the \nCICIG to strengthen the fight against OC in Guatemala by providing \nadditional resources.264\nIf the Seized Assets Law were in effect, the government could use part \nof the money and assets confiscated in the first five months of 2011 (Q24.3 billion, or US$3 billion) to fund at least seven new counter-narcotics \nprosecution offices, according to Minister Menocal.\n265 Meanwhile, the \ngovernment is working to open a Special Counter-narcotics Office on \nthe Pacific coast to monitor and curtail drug trafficking in the area. This \noffice is slated to operate with a team of 80. \nThere is also a joint effort between the Interior Ministry and the \nU.S. and Colombian governments to form a Counter Narcotics Agency \nthat would take over and expand the duties of the current counter-\nnarcotics police.  The new agency would have three branches: one to gather intelligence on a regional level, one for operations, and one to \nimplement preventive policies.\nColom explained that a more comprehensive strategy is needed to \ngo beyond law enforcement, drug seizures, and eradication of poppy \nplantations. Poppies are eradicated early in the year, but by September \nnew crops have been produced and must be destroyed again. \u201cThe \nproblem is lack of development [employment and income sources] in the area where eradication takes place,\u201d according to Colom.\n266\nThe Colom government\u2019s Social Cohesion program, run by First \nLady Sandra Torres,267 comprises part of the government\u2019s development \nstrategy; but the program has generated strong criticism that it is a political \ntool to help the governing party win reelection in 2011. The program\u2019s \nbasic provisions\u2014like other cash transfer programs in Latin America\u2014\nconsist of distributing subsidies to low-income families in exchange for a \ncommitment to send their children to school (as opposed to having them \nwork) and to a government-run local clinic for regular medical checkups. \nThe program also includes the distribution of food in poverty-stricken communities and weekend public school programs (with extracurricular \nactivities like English, dancing, and computer courses) in violence-\nprone areas. Critics question the government\u2019s allocation of public funds \nfor activities that appear to have a political motive.  Indeed, press reports \nindicate that in some communities, beneficiaries of the Social Cohesion Julie L\u00f3pez| 212 |program have been required to show their UNE (the governing party) \nmembership ID card before receiving assistance.\nIn theory, the Social Cohesion program helps prevent violence by \nkeeping children and teenagers from joining gangs, creates educational \nopportunities, and stimulates the local economy by stimulating \nconsumption.  In practice, however, there have been a number of \nproblems. The education and health care systems have been inadequately \nprepared to respond to the increased demand for services.  And there is not enough monitoring to determine whether the subsidies are reaching \nthe families most in need. \nThe government refused to disclose the names of the beneficiaries \nof the program as a means to ensure that public funds are not being \nmisused. The government argued that, if released, the information \ncould be subject to political manipulation by the opposition. Most of the \npublic, however, appears to want greater accountability.   \nResources, or the lack thereof, constitute a sensitive subject for \nthe Colom administration. Some in the political opposition and in civil society agree that a more comprehensive anti-poverty strategy is \nneeded that would provide educational and employment opportunities \nto people who might otherwise opt to join criminal networks. At the \nsame time, they question the executive\u2019s methods and the efficacy of \nthe Social Cohesion program. Some even believe that the funds for the Social Cohesion program should be allocated to the police instead.  The \npolitical divide over this issued increased as the September 2011 elections \napproached.\nThe Role of the CICIG\nThe establishment of the CICIG has constituted the cornerstone of Guatemala\u2019s anti-OC policy. The CICIG\u2019s contributions have been \nsignificant in the eyes of many, including the U.S. Embassy, which has \nbeen a vocal supporter of and an important donor to the U.N. commission.\n\u201cCases have been investigated much better than they ever were \nbefore; cases have advanced much further in the court system than \nthey ever were before, including very sensitive cases\u2014which are the \nkind of cases CICIG takes on\u2014involving official corruption in past Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 213 |administrations. So that\u2019s good,\u201d said Ambassador McFarland. \u201cI think \nthere has been significant progress.  It\u2019s not irreversible progress, but \nit\u2019s certainly progress.\u201d268 \nOn October 18, 2010, the U.S. government pledged US$4 million \nto the CICIG to support its continued work.  An additional US$15 \nmillion was raised from the international community for CICIG and \nits mandate has been extended to 2013.  There is concern that the \njustice system will not pursue cases with the same thoroughness\u2014or \nreceive enough funding\u2014after the CICIG\u2019s mandate expires in August \n2013. Nevertheless, the current head of the commission, Costa Rican prosecutor Francisco Dall\u2019Anese, has warned that the CICIG is not \u201cthe \nfairy godmother with a magic wand,\u201d able to fix all that ails Guatemala. \nHe has pushed for local justice and security institutions to assume their \nleading roles in fighting crime, corruption, impunity, and collusion with \nOC, taking on a higher profile than the CICIG. \nThe CICIG has had a high profile, particularly in cases that have \ngarnered broad national attention.  The Rodrigo Rosenberg case and the indictment of former Minister of the Interior Carlos Vielman for \nallegedly masterminding several extra-judicial executions in 2006 are \ntwo examples. However, the acquittal of former president Portillo and \ntwo of his former cabinet members was a major blow to the CICIG, \nwhich has appealed the decision. \nRosenberg was killed on May 10, 2009. After his death, a video \nthat he had recorded days prior to his death surfaced in which he accused President Colom and First Lady Sandra Torres of ordering his \nassassination; this was in connection with a corruption case with which \nRosenberg was allegedly familiar. The CICIG proved that Rosenberg \nhad planned his own death, but continues to investigate the corruption \ncase alluded to by the slain attorney. The Rosenberg case was one of the \ncases in which the Plea-Bargaining Law, approved by Congress at the \nrequest and insistence of the CICIG, helped to identify the defendants and reach a conviction.\nAfter the Rosenberg case went to trial in June 2010, a judge hearing \nthe case said that \u201cnever in the history of Guatemala has an investigation \ndeveloped to such a point as to clarify a criminal act, using scientific \nand technical investigative tools, with positive results to find the truth, \nwhich was possible thanks to the work done by the CICIG.\u201d\n269 Nine Julie L\u00f3pez| 214 |people were convicted in July 2010 and, as of this writing in July 2011, \ntwo more are awaiting trial as the intellectual authors of the crime.\nThe investigation led to the dismantling of two OC networks, \none operating in Escuintla (southern Guatemala) and another in the \ndepartment of Guatemala (where the capital is located). The networks \nwere comprised of active and retired police officers, assassins for hire, \nand retired military officers.\nThe Vielman case (in which the former director of the prison system, \nAlejandro Giamattei, was acquitted) also brought unwanted attention to the CICIG.  Former Vice President Eduardo Stein criticized what \nhe said were a lack of due process guarantees and a presumption of \ninnocence. He questioned the CICIG\u2019s handling of information about \nthe case with the press and called for a tighter supervision from the \nUnited Nations, specifically in terms of periodic evaluations. The kinds \nof actions criticized by the former vice president took place during the tenure of CICIG commissioner Carlos Castresana. When he resigned, \nhe attributed his departure to the growing criticism against him and its \nnegative impact on the cases the commission was handling.  However, \nin late October 2010, he told the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds  that his \ndeparture from Guatemala resulted from the discovery of a plot against his life.\n270\nAnother key case among the 27 the Commission has been investigating \nsince 2008 involved the murder of V\u00edctor Rivera, a Venezuelan who was advising the Guatemalan government on security matters. Rivera \nwas killed on April 7, 2008, after his contract was rescinded by Colom\u2019s \nadministration.  The Rivera case is linked to that of former Minister \nVielman and has led to several convictions.  In another important case \nin 2011, the CICIG appealed a lower court\u2019s ruling in the Portillo case; \nmeanwhile, the former president remained imprisoned at the Mariscal Zavala military base, awaiting a decision on his extradition to the United \nStates on money laundering charges, which he has disputed.Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 215 |Striking a Balance: Political Alliances versus \nPolitical Will\nHelen Mack has said that police reform can become a new opportunity \nfor Guatemala, but she warned that framing the issue in electoral terms \nin the run-up to the September 2011 elections risked detracting from its importance.  \u201cPolitical and corrupt considerations trump technical \nones at a time when reform should be viewed as the state\u2019s responsibility to provide security,\u201d she says. \u201cThe [political] immediacy from all \nthe active political forces in the country\u2014and I am referring to the \neconomic sector, the government, and organized civil society\u2014has \nprevented us from embarking together on a policy that could allow us \nto fight for the same goal. There could be differences in format, but not \nof substance, and agreements on substance are what we have never ever \nhad in Guatemala.\u201d\n271 \nThe success of the new plan for police reform depends not only on \nresources but on political will to implement it over the long term. It remains unclear whether or not the reforms will be fully implemented.\n\u201cWill all this come together and be long-lasting? Don\u2019t know,\u201d \nAmbassador McFarland admits. \u201cI think that with police reform there is \na qualitative change between what previous governments did and what \nthis government has begun to do, and would like to do, which is to thoroughly vet senior officers for senior positions in the police.\u201d\n272 \nFrom Mack\u2019s perspective, there are many good policemen who \nwant to change things but remain skeptical because most programs lack continuity. In addition, police wages are low\u2014some earn as little as \nUS$580 a month. Police earn less than prosecutors and judges and tend \nto be viewed as having less authority. \u201cIn light of this situation, you \ncannot expect (the police) to increase their morale by just telling them \n\u2018Chin up! Increase your self-esteem\u2019 if they don\u2019t see concrete changes. That\u2019s why we are pushing for improvements in police officers\u2019 well-\nbeing,\u201d Mack explained.\n273\nFinancial support from the international community for the \nCommission for Police Reform was minimal until late August 2010. Up until that time the Commission had only received one donation of \n40,000 Euros from the German organization PCOE-G&Z, which was \nused to draft a police reform plan and to evaluate police capacities in Julie L\u00f3pez| 216 |different areas.274 The costs for the first phase of police reform, an 18-\nmonth period that began in September 2010, were not large and were \nestimated to be about US$2 million. An additional Q40 million ($5 \nmillion) was needed for improvements in police welfare.  (Ironically, this \nis the same amount that was allegedly embezzled by the previous interior \nminister, Ra\u00fal Vel\u00e1squez).  According to Mack, \u201cboth the President and \nthe Minister of Interior have the needed will, but it cannot shine through \ndue to the different pressure points out there, and I am referring directly to the budget\u2026Police reform without additional budgetary investment \nis impossible.\u201d\n275\nInternational donors made sizeable commitments to Central America \nat the June 22-23, 2011, SICA conference on security issues in Antigua, Guatemala. These pledges included US$1.2 billion in development and \nsecurity assistance from the European Union, part of an aid program \nthat began in 2007 and will end in 2013, and that also includes funding \nfor the CICIG. The World Bank offered US$200 million for similar \npurposes, along with US$1 billion in loans for the region. The United \nStates will have provided US$240 million between 2010 and 2011, and Canada offered US$5 million to Interpol in the region, for police \ntraining and optimizing communications, and to support the CICIG \nin Guatemala. Before the funds are allocated, international donors and \nthe Central American countries must decide the areas of greatest need. \nIn addition, in Guatemala the Congress must approve any foreign loan \nbefore the government can receive it.\n276 In 2011, several proposed loans \nwhere not finalized  after the Congress disapproved an increase in the country\u2019s debt.\nPresident Colom understood that foreign aid was unlikely to increase \nsubstantially unless the country assumed more responsibility for \nfinancing its own security; donor countries do not want to use their tax \nrevenue to help another country whose citizens pay little or no taxes. \nA clamp-down on government corruption and tighter control on tax evasion could increase the resources available. According to Ambassador \nMcFarland, for the United States to continue to invest in Guatemala\u2019s \nsecurity and judicial system, it needs to have the confidence that \nGuatemala is making an effort to select the right people to lead reform \nefforts in the judiciary, the Public Ministry, and the police.Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 217 |Guatemala has the second lowest tax burden relative to GDP in all \nof Latin America;277 but its financial difficulties since 2008 have been \nexacerbated by three crises: the steep increase in international oil prices, \nthe rise in global food prices, and the world recession.  While other \ncountries in the region endured the same crises, UNDP adviser Ricardo \nStein noted that Guatemala\u2019s vulnerability was heightened due to the \nincrease in organized crime, a scenario from which the previous Berger \nadministration barely escaped.\n\u201cThe fiscal weakness of the country affects the whole security system,\u201d \nStein said. \u201cThe police have no capacity to process the information they have and\u2026cannot pay a large body of detectives\u201d to gather information.  \nThe lack of funds also impairs investigations. For example, the Public \nMinistry has difficulty in funding its own witness protection program. \nIn October 2010, the CICIG had to cover the expenses of two families \nwho were flown out of the country after testifying in high profile cases.           \nThe Role of Political Alliances\nThe complexity of dealing with the Guatemalan Congress explains why \nit is difficult to secure passage of crucial laws for the advancement of \njustice and security. Although the government is seen abroad as unable \nto approve key legislation, the number of political forces with which the \nexecutive branch must negotiate explains why the legislative process is \nfull of roadblocks.\nThe country has had a democratic system since 1986, with few \nrestrictions on the formation of political parties and few parties lasting in the Congress for more than two or three administrations.  There \nare currently 23 political parties in Guatemala, 14 of which have \nrepresentation in the Congress. During their terms, members of \nCongress can change parties at will or declare themselves independent of \nany party. This has become a trend that makes it very hard to influence \nthe Congress, inside or out.  Even Manuel Baldiz\u00f3n\u2014the main leader \nin the Congress from the governing party at the beginning of Colom\u2019s administration\u2014left the ruling party to form his own political party.Julie L\u00f3pez| 218 |\u201cSome time ago, it was said that the president could control the \npolitical parties in the Congress. Now I can assure you as President that \nit\u2019s impossible to control them,\u201d said Colom. \u201cWhen I say \u2018control\u2019 I \nrefer specifically to the fact that at least once a week we tell them, \u2018these \nare the laws that are a priority.\u2019\u201d278 \nFor these reasons, the Seized Assets Law was the subject of much \ndiscussion and friction between the executive and the legislature.  The \nexecutive pressed for passage of the law because it would allow the \ngovernment to use assets seized to fund security measures. However, \nthe legislative branch faced private sector demands to toughen laws, \nsuch as the Arms and Munitions Law and the Organized Crime Law, to \nlimit the number of arms, weapons, and ammunition in the streets, and curtail the rise of crime and violence. The Illicit Enrichment Law was \nalso plagued by major roadblocks.\nThe Seized Assets Law, scheduled to go into effect in July 2011, could \nhelp weaken OC financially and strengthen the fight against crime.  \nFor instance, had the law been approved in October 2010, the Q23.3 \nmillion ($2.9 million) seized during the last two weeks of the month \ncould have covered one year\u2019s salary for 325 police officers, the purchase of 125 police cars, and the tripling of wiretapping operations.\n279  After \nthe law goes into effect, Minister Menocal has plans for some of the 558 \nvehicles seized from criminals between 2008 and the first half of 2011.  \nAt least 35 percent of the bullet-proof vehicles, valued at US$103,000 \nto US$260,000 each, will be assigned to authorities handling highly \nsensitive cases.280 For their part, some opposition parties claim the law \ncontains too many discretionary powers and question whether Menocal\u2019s \nplan will go forward.  \nAmbassador McFarland maintained that it is important to engage \nall political parties in the policy-making process due to the shifting \ncomposition of the legislature. \u201cFor policies to have continuity and \npolitical strength, they need to have support from a number of different \nparties and broader sectors of society,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to believe it\u2019s worth it. I think that political will happens when people reach the point \nwhen they realize they have to transcend some pretty big differences in \norder to survive.\u201d\n281 \nSome Guatemalan decision-makers, apparently, have not yet reached \nthis point.Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 219 |One year before Castresana resigned as head of the CICIG, he touted \nthe National Accord for the Advancement of Security and Justice (signed \nin April 2009) as a road map for Guatemala to ensure continuity in \nthe reform process. The accord\u2014signed by the executive, legislative, \nand judicial branches and supported by the Catholic Church, Protestant \nChurches, the Human Rights Ombudsman\u2019s Office, and San Carlos \nUniversity (a public but autonomous university) \u2013provided a framework \nfor the all three branches of government to pursue several major objectives, including institutional strengthening, improving criminal \ninvestigation, increasing transparency and reducing corruption and \nimpunity. \nSix months after the accord was signed, the government maintained \nthat it had made progress in areas such as police reform, planning for \nthe creation of a Ministry of Security that would not be constrained by \nadministrative tasks unrelated to security, improving anti-crime policies, and drafting a plan to reform the penitentiary system by increasing salaries \nand improving infrastructure. But by September 2010, the information \non any additional progress was limited, and Minister Menocal argued \nthat most of the objectives would be achieved only over the long term.\n282 \nAttaining some of the objectives involves congressional approval of laws to fight OC and corruption, a potentially lengthy process. \nIn an effort to revive the accord, the CICIG worked with President \nColom and the resident coordinator of the U.N. system in Guatemala. \nThey proposed a series of actions that include re-launching the accord \nwith the participation of all political parties and prioritizing ten out of its \nthe 101 points. Amongst these are provisions to carry out any pending commitments stemming from the 1996 peace agreements, to establish a \nlong-term anti-crime policy along with a long-term policy agenda with \nconcrete actions, dates, and areas of responsibility for fighting OC.\n283\nIn Guatemala there are several precedents for consensus-building on \nsensitive political matters. Although the establishment of the CICIG \nis the highest profile example, Guatemalan political parties have also \nunited in support of establishing a wiretap unit within the PNC, \napproving legislation to create High-Impact Courts that process highly \nsensitive cases, and approving the Plea-Bargaining Law. Ambassador \nMcFarland acknowledged that a national plan that \u201ccuts across sectors\u201d Julie L\u00f3pez| 220 |was difficult to achieve but \u201cessential for doing something about \nimpunity and insecurity.\u201d284\nGuatemala\u2019s private sector is very critical of government corruption. \nIt has also been hard hit by violence. It tends to rely on private firms, not \ngovernment institutions, to provide security. It is common for business \nowners to pay US$5,000 a month\u2014or more\u2014for private security. \nGovernment corruption scandals have undermined the government\u2019s \ncredibility with the private sector with respect to tax reform and \nincreased tax collection.\nPresident Colom claims his administration has been forthcoming in \nrecognizing corruption cases in government agencies. \u201cThere might be an exception here and there, but all of the major accusations of corruption \nthat have surfaced during this administration have been announced by \nthe government,\u201d said Colom.\n285 The president appeared to suggest that, \nmore than conditioning foreign and domestic financing on results, the country needs financing to produce better results, thereby avoiding the \nsending of police officers equipped with small arms to confront criminals \nbrandishing AK-47 machine guns.\nThe M\u00e9rida Initiative and the Role and Role of \nForeign Assistance\nAs part of the M\u00e9rida Initiative between the United States and Mexico, \nCentral America was initially slated to receive US$65 million of a projected \n$1.5 billion security program.  The initial allocation for Guatemala was US$16 million.  \nAn additional $100 million in each of two subsequent fiscal years (FY \n2011 and FY 2012) were to go to Central America under region-wide \nCentral America Regional Security Initiative, known as CARSI. 286  The \namounts were to be paid in several annual disbursements. The M\u00e9rida \nInitiative\u2019s initial purpose was to create a framework for the United States \nto support Mexican efforts to combat organized crime.  U.S. support for \nCentral America was added to the Initiative later.  The principal strategic \npriorities envisioned in this framework were to strengthen the capacity \nof Mexican armed forces and law enforcement to effectively confront \norganized crime, reduce the violence and coercive influence associated with criminal organizations enhancing the capacity of law enforcement Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 221 |institutions to uphold the rule of law, and, ultimately, to reduce the flow \nof drugs through the Mexico-Central America corridor. \nFunding for Guatemala  initially supported drug consumption \nprevention programs; but Minister Menocal and others insisted that more \nsupport was needed instead to train and better equip civilian security \nforces that fight drug trafficking. For its part, the State Department \nmaintains that some of the M\u00e9rida Initiative funding helps train law-\nenforcement officials and helps enforce anti-crime policies. The current government of Guatemala agreed with the U.S. Department of State that \nthe initiative must become more comprehensive in terms of preventing \naddiction, targeting criminal networks, and launching development \nprograms in poor communities.\nOther kinds of assistance have been made available, including four \nhelicopters on loan from the U.S. Narcotics Affairs Service (NAS) \nfor counter-narcotics operations. President Colom admitted that coordination efforts within the Guatemalan security and military forces \nhad to improve, to reduce the time between a request for a helicopter \nand its actual arrival, especially in  unforeseen situations such as the \ndetection of a large illicit transaction or an armed attack in a remote \narea of the country that is not easily accessible. \u201cThis is a fight that is not \ngoing to last one or two years\u2014but several,\u201d admitted Colom. \u201cThere \nis good coordination with U.S. agencies, but sometimes events develop quickly and it\u2019s not possible to respond in a timely manner. We need to \nhave better coordination amongst the Guatemalan agencies.\u201d\n287 \nNevertheless, there is some evidence that coordination within \nGuatemala is improving. The 2010 International Narcotics Control \nStrategy Report (INCSR) documented an increase in drug seizures in \nGuatemala, including a doubling of the amount of cocaine seized from \n2008 (2,214 kilos) to 2009 (6,936 kilos). The report attributed these \nresults to better trained police and \u201cimproved Guatemalan interagency \ncooperation\u201d through the Aviation Support Program (ASP), to the Guatemalan Air Interdiction Joint Task Force (FIAAT) and the wire \ninterception program. In 2009, a total of 41 intercepts were conducted.\n288\nMinister Menocal also acknowledged that financial and technical help \nfrom the United States had been instrumental in setting up a fingerprint lab, honing investigative techniques, improving the penitentiary system, \nand inaugurating the PNC\u2019s Counter-narcotics Unit in the Pacific Julie L\u00f3pez| 222 |coast region, as well as in building a new armored drug warehouse.289 \nIntelligence-sharing has also been helpful in identifying and investigating \nthe main leaders of organized crime structures.\nGuatemala also received significant technical support from Mexico \non the use of polygraphs. Polygraph tests are now a part of the process to \nfully vet police officers for high-level positions, such as the PNC director \nand deputy director and the chiefs of key precincts. This process was \nused to select current PNC Director Jaime Leonel Otz\u00edn, named in June 2010.  Of the seven officers who were vying for the position, he was the \nonly one who passed a battery of tests, including the polygraph. \u201cThe \nresult was painful but hopeful,\u201d concluded Colom.\n290 The salary earned \nby the PNC director is Q24,195 monthly (US$3,142).\nContinuing to work on institutional strengthening of the judicial \nand security sectors constitutes the next priority for foreign assistance, \nparticularly that of the United States and the European Union. The focus \nneeds to be on increasing the capabilities of personnel in these sectors, \nhelping them make significant arrests, carrying out successful criminal \ninvestigations according to the rule of law, and continuing support for the CICIG. \u201cFrom our perspective, the counter-narcotics and the anti-\norganized crime struggles fall under a broader effort to try to reduce \nimpunity and to improve rule of law institutions,\u201d stated Ambassador \nMcFarland. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a functioning court system, if you don\u2019t \nhave good prosecutors for that matter, if you don\u2019t have decent prisons, \nthen it doesn\u2019t matter who you arrest, and what you seize, it\u2019s just \ngoing to be replaced.\u201d\n291 From the ambassador\u2019s perspective, the ability \nto dismantle OC networks will also make it possible for government \nofficials to resist the efforts of these organizations to have political \ninfluence.\nMexican Ambassador Eduardo Ibarrola stressed that high rates of \nimpunity are a central driver of crime in Mexico and Central America. \nGovernments in this region face a triple challenge because they must \nrespond to youth gangs ( maras ) along with organized and common \ncrime.  Ibarrola expressed his conviction that greater cooperation with \nCentral America is needed to fight criminal organizations. \nMexico has begun to implement a strategy that has a direct impact on \nGuatemala. It involves increasing the nation\u2019s capacity to process a larger \nnumber of travelers and merchants through legal border crossings. \u201cThe Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 223 |point of the program is to facilitate compliance with immigration laws \nfor border residents and crossers,\u201d Ambassador Ibarrola said.292\nSurveillance of the entire Mexico-Guatemala border is difficult due \nto the nature of the terrain, which includes jungle, forests, and rivers. \nClosing or legalizing the unsupervised (sometimes called blind) crossing \npoints is out of the question. However, Mexico is already exercising \ntighter control of its main roads near the border because they are points \nof convergence for those who cross the border illegally. \nSamuel Logan, regional manager for the Americas at iJet Intelligent \nRisk Systems, a risk management consulting firm in Maryland, warned that \u201cif Guatemala goes down the drain, then Mexico is dealing with \nits northern and its southern borders. A major failure of democracy in \nGuatemala is going to directly impact Mexico City\u2014resources, political \ncapital, time, energy, human resources, everything\u2014and that negatively \naffects the United States.\u201d\n293\nThe U.S. Ambassador maintained that the relationship with Guatemala \nis not about trying to tell Guatemalans what to do to help the United \nStates, but about trying to encourage Guatemala to do the things that \nboth countries consider necessary to address common problems. These \ncommon problems have consequences for the whole region, and the \nfailure of democracy in one country has a direct impact on its neighbors.\nRetired Colonel M\u00e9rida believes that Guatemala should be pushing \nfor the establishment of a trilateral office with Mexico and the United States. This office would gather and process a variety of information \non OC networks from identifying their area of operation to profiling \nits members. This information would be made available to and could \nbe used by any of the three countries. Nevertheless, for this to happen, \nGuatemala must have a solid justice system.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s critical right now is strengthening current efforts to reform \nthe courts and to strengthen the Public Ministry, as well as police reform,\u201d said McFarland. \u201cIf they are successful, there will be a surge \nbehind them that will give them a good chance to continue. But these \nthings take time, and the full results of any reforms enacted now won\u2019t \nbe evident for a few years.\u201d\n294 He cautioned, however, against unrealistic \nexpectations.  \u201cIt\u2019s human nature to expect things will happen more quickly than they can be delivered, or to hope that there is some kind \nof magical solution out there that can help you,\u201d reflected McFarland.\n295 Julie L\u00f3pez| 224 |Despite the lack of a silver bullet, crime statistics provide some measure \nof hope.  A radio program on October 29, 2010, quoted Minister Menocal \nas saying that there were 430 fewer violent deaths between January and \nSeptember 2010 than there were in the same period in 2009; and that in \n2010, 16 violent deaths were reported daily in Guatemala, as opposed to \n18 in 2009 and 20 in 2008.296 \nStatistics can mask the names of victims, such as 15-year old Patricia \nVel\u00e1squez, a street vendor, and 28-year old Jennifer Prentice, recent recipient of a Ph.D, both of whom were killed on October 16, 2010, in \nthe attack on the Zona Viva restaurant of Guatemala City. Their deaths \nbring to mind a statement by leading Guatemalan sociologist Edelberto \nTorres-Rivas:  referring to the 150,000 killed during the armed conflict, \nTorres-Rivas recalled Stalin\u2019s \u201ccynical remark\u201d that the murder of one person is a crime, but the murder of many is just a statistic.\n297  If, like \nMcFarland says, political will is achievable when people realize that they \nneed to overcome differences to survive, hopefully Guatemala is close \nto reaching the point where survival means that one more victim is one \ntoo many.\nConclusion\nGuatemala is indeed on the threshold of a new opportunity with the \nrecent police reform. Police reform might not be the solution to all of \nGuatemala\u2019s problems, but it could be the beginning of a solution, a fresh \nstart after the country lost its way following the peace accords. Standing \nin the way are old habits such as the lack of commitment to developing \nand implementing policies over the long term. While building consensus \naround long-term security plans amongst all political parties might be \nthe appropriate antidote to the lack of policy continuity, such efforts have been complicated by the September 2011 elections.\nSecurity remained the principal issue for electoral candidates. The \nsolutions offered and the plans drafted by candidates may be better \nsuited for winning office than for governing. As the Colom government \nexperienced since 2008, security plans that are not based on \u201cinside\u201d \ninformation will not be successful. Although at the heart of the problem \ncontinues to be a lack of continuity in security policies and programs Guatemala\u2019s Crossroads:   \nThe Democratization of Violence and Second Chances| 225 |and insufficient resources, several factors have contributed to the current \nsituation of insecurity in the country. \nThe strengthening of political parties has had consequences for \nsecurity. Simplified rules for the formation of political parties gave \nrise to a plethora of political organizations. While this can be viewed \nas positive, it becomes a liability when most parties are not strong \nenough to maintain representation in Congress beyond the span of two \nor three presidential administrations. As a result, initiatives crumble as parties fold or proponents of reform must look for new partners.  The \nfact that congressional representatives can easily switch political parties \nfurther complicates the situation, not only for the governing party but \nfor the success of different initiatives. Indeed, many parties form when \nconsensus is not reached and a party leader decides to leave an existing \nparty and form a new one.\nIf political parties had more staying power and party loyalty was \nstronger inside and outside of the Congress, the participation of political parties in important state policy decisions could become an \nadvantage.  For example, stronger political parties that endure over time \nand participate in discussions about policy reform are likely to produce \neventual candidates for public office; if elected, these individuals can \ncarry out the policy reforms their party supported.  By contrast, elected \nofficials belonging to a young party that did not participate in these discussions (or belonging to an older party with a high rate of turnover) \nwill have less incentive to execute agreed-upon reforms.  Weak political \nparties are thus a handicap for the political system and the survival of \nthe reform process, including the kinds of commitments made in the \nNational Accord for the Advancement of Security and Justice.  \nImproving the Law for Civil Service would permit the creation of a \nmore professional and permanent workforce and prevent the appointment of public servants as payment for political favors, even if the individuals \nare not qualified for the positions they occupy. Such innovation could \nhelp create more permanent state policies on security, as opposed to the \ncurrent practice of quickly wiping away policies whenever a new official \ntakes over, whether at a presidential or cabinet level.  In such a situation, \ncontinuity and long-term results could become possible, allowing \nGuatemala to pick up where it left off after signing the peace accords 15 years ago.
