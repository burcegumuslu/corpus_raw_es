Protein intake may play a key role in modulating body mass and function of various organs and systems ( [3](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR3), [4](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR4)). This influence can be exerted by a direct effect on the target organs ( [5](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR5)) and via the modulation of whole body size ( [6](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR6)) resulting in functional load of vital organs. Recent evidence indicates that feeding infant formulas with higher protein (HP) content resulted in an increased kidney volume, with a direct effect on kidney function, and an increase in whole body mass ( [3](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR3), [7](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR7)). One of the target organs affected by early protein intakes is the heart, the development of which occurs in an early embryonic phase. As such, early postnatal nutrition would affect growth since this is the period in which the fastest growth of the body and organs takes place. Effects of protein supply in pregnancy on left ventricular function have been described in rats ( [8](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR8)). Similarly, infants and children suffering from protein-energy malnutrition have been shown to have reduced left ventricular mass (LVM) and function ( [9](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR9), [10](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR10), [11](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR11)) proportional to body surface ( [10](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR10)). In animal models, early life overnutrition has been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy ( [12](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR12)). Investigations have been conducted on cardiac function parameters under extreme protein supply situations, but data are lacking on the effect of normal protein supplies on these parameters.\nProteins serve as structural substrates for heart tissue development. However, proteins can also affect the growth of the heart through a systemic stimulation of the constituents of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis. The rationale in suggesting this mechanism is based on the observation that increased protein intakes, via infant formula diets, under nonextreme conditions, stimulate the growth of other organs, such as the kidney (\n[7](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR7)). Further, cardiac hypertrophy in acromegaly is partly mediated by the growth hormone (GH)/IGF-1 axis; a meta-analysis confirmed that treating acromegaly with IGF-1 analogues (aiming to reduce the growth hormone/IGF-1 axis activity) reduces the cardiac hypertrophy and improves hemodynamic parameters ( [13](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR13)). These findings in adults were also observed in younger patients as well as in animal models ( [14](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR14), [15](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR15), [16](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR16)). Recently, we found that nonextremely variations in protein supply with infant formulae resulted in varying kidney growth and function in healthy infants, and this was partly mediated by modulation of the IGF-1 axis ( [3](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR3), [7](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR7)).\nThe aim of this study was to assess the effect of different protein intakes during the first year of life on cardiac mass and function at 2 y of age in healthy infants.\nResults\nStudy Sample\nOf the 261 Spanish children remaining in the original European-Childhood Obesity Program randomized trial (trial number in clinicaltrials.gov NCT00338689), 145 accepted the invitation to attend an additional visit to perform the cardiac assessments at the age of 2 y. The assessments were performed between November 2004 and March 2006. The different study groups were composed of 100 formula-fed children of whom 51 and 49 had HP and lower protein (LP) formula, respectively, and 45 were breastfed (BF). Technically acceptable echocardiographic assessments were obtained in 141 children (97% of the participants); in 4 cases, the triplicate measurements were unsatisfactory and were discarded from the statistical analyses. Triplicate blood pressure measurements were obtained in 110 children (78% of the participants); 31 children did not fulfill the criteria of technically acceptable readings. At 6 mo of age, a blood sample was drawn in 109 children from the 141 who had had valid echocardiography (\n[\nFigure 1\n](/articles/pr201630#Fig1)). All available data from each output were used for the analyses. There were no significant differences in anthropometric measurements from birth to 2 y between infants who had the cardiac assessment and those who did not. Gender distribution as well as anthropometry at birth (weight, length, and head circumference) did not differ between the two formula-fed groups, or between the formula and BF groups.\nEffect of Protein Intake on Anthropometry\nAs previously observed in the whole EU-Childhood Obesity Program cohort (\n[6](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR6)), the HP group had higher BMI z-scores compared with the LP group (0.68 \u00b1 0.77 vs. 0.22 \u00b1 0.84, P = 0.005 for HP and LP, respectively) at 2 y of age. In addition to the BMI z-score, we found significant differences between groups in terms of absolute BMI (16.7 \u00b1 1.0 vs. 16.0 \u00b1 1.1, P = 0.006 for HP and LP, respectively) whereas weight and height did not differ significantly between groups; neither as absolute values (weight: 12.7 \u00b1 1.3 vs. 12.3 \u00b1 1.2, P = 0.173; height: 87.4 \u00b1 3.2 vs. 87.8 \u00b1 2.7, P = 0.445, for HP and LP respectively) nor standardized as z-score.\nCardiovascular Parameters\nResults from the echocardiographic assessment showed that cardiac function parameters were modulated by protein intake, whereas cardiac mass did not differ between the feeding groups. LVM was slightly higher in the HP group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (29.5 \u00b1 5.6 vs. 29.13 \u00b1 4.3, P=0.69 for HP and LP, respectively). Similar results were observed with respect to the indexed left ventricular mass (LVMI) (42.6 \u00b1 7.7 vs. 41.4 \u00b1 6.0, P = 0.400 for HP and LP, respectively). However, both ejection fraction (EF) and shortening fraction (SF) were higher among children receiving the HP formula compared with the LP group (69.1 \u00b1 5.1 vs. 66.7 \u00b1 4.9 for EF and 37.7 \u00b1 4.1 vs. 35.8 \u00b1 3.8 for SF, P < 0.05 for both groups) (\n[\nFigure 2\n](/articles/pr201630#Fig2)). Linear regression models using the protein intake (g/d) from the monthly food diaries were applied to estimate the effect of the formulas on cardiac function. Results showed that each additional g/d of protein intake during the first 6 mo of life increased EF and SF at 2 y ( [\nFigure 3a\n](/articles/pr201630#Fig3)). The effect of protein increase was greater during the first month and decreased progressively subsequently; EF increased by 0.52% for each g/d of protein intake increase during the first month of life (P < 0.001), 0.43% during the second month of life (P = 0.001), 0.31% during the third (P < 0.01) and 0.17% during the sixth month (P < 0.05). The EF and SF values at 2 y were independent of the protein intake from the sixth month onwards. Similarly, protein intake during the first 6 mo (but not subsequently) showed a significant effect on weight and BMI at 2 y ( [\nFigure 3b\n](/articles/pr201630#Fig3)). Multivariate linear regression models adjusted for anthropometric variables were applied to assess whether there was a direct effect of type of formula feeding on EF. Results showed that HP formula feeding was significantly associated with an increase of 2.03 units (95% CI: 0.07, 4.00) (P = 0.043) in EF, despite adjusting for weight z-score. Both variables explained up to 11.3% of EF variability while weight z-score alone explained 8.6%. Results of these analyses were similar for SF (data not shown).\nCardiovascular variables were associated with anthropometry at 2 y (\n[\nTable 1\n](/articles/pr201630#Tab1)). Cardiac mass and function were significantly correlated with BMI z-score, weight z-score, length z-score, weight gain per month z-score, and length gain per month z-score. Relationships between cardiac mass and anthropometry values disappear when LVM was indexed as LVMI. In our study, we did not find significant relationships between anthropometry and blood pressure measurements (neither with systolic nor diastolic pressure). We predicted the energy expenditure for each child using the individual\u2019s anthropometric data. This parameter was directly correlated with EF (r = 0.30, P < 0.001), SF (r = 0.32, P < 0.001) as well as with LVM (r = 0.43, P < 0.001). Values of energy expenditure differed between genders (1,013 \u00b1 49 vs. 942 \u00b1 72 kcal/d for boys and girls respectively, P < 0.001), but were similar for the overall study groups (HP: 977 \u00b1 78; LP: 982 \u00b1 70; BF: 966 \u00b1 67 kcal/d; P=0.578).\nProtein Intake and IGF-1 Axis\nResults of the IGF-1 axis parameters segregated with respect to feeding groups are depicted in\n[\nFigure 4\n](/articles/pr201630#Fig4). HP-fed children showed higher concentrations of free IGF-1, compared with the LP and BF groups and lower concentrations of IGF-1 binding protein 2 compared with LP and BF groups (P < 0.001). Total IGF-1 and IGF-1 binding protein 3 concentrations were higher in both formula-fed groups compared with BF children.\nRelationship Between IGF-1 Axis, Anthropometry, and Cardiovascular Variables\nTotal and free IGF-1 showed linear associations with weight z-score and BMI z-score at 6 mo (total IGF-1: r = 0.300 and r = 0.255, P < 0.01; free IGF-1: r = 0.330, P < 0.001 and r = 0.324, P<0.01 for weight z-score and BMI z-score, respectively). Also, free IGF-1 was correlated with weight z-score (r = 0.242, P = 0.011) and BMI z-score (r = 0.204, P = 0.032) at 2 y.\nNo statistically significant relationships were found between cardiac mass at 2 y and the IGF-1 axis parameters at 6 mo. Conversely, cardiac function parameters were associated with IGF-1 binding protein 2 (r = \u22120.199 and r = \u22120.201, P < 0.05 for EF and SF, respectively) and blood pressure at 2 y was associated with free IGF-1 (r = 0.303, P = 0.01 and r = 0.389, P < 0.001 for sistolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, respectively) measured at 6 mo of age.\nFinally, multivariate analyses with linear regression models measuring the influence of feeding type on cardiac function parameters adjusted for weight z-score were not altered when IGF-1 was introduced into the model (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nNutritional factors influence subsequent development of cardiac function (\n[17](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR17), [18](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR18)). Such relationships have only been documented in situations where one or the other was grossly altered, i.e., malnutrition or cardiac pathology. Our study explores, for the first time, the association between neonate nutrition and cardiac function in healthy infants. Our results show that a HP intake in infancy is associated with a higher cardiac systolic function at 2 y of age.\nEffect of Protein Intake on Body Structure and Cardiovascular Parameters\nProtein intake during infancy is one of the key nutritional factors affecting obesity risk, and other health consequences later in life (\n[1](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR1), [2](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR2), [6](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR6)). In concordance with the overall EU-Childhood Obesity Program findings, our results in this (Spanish) subsample support the hypothesis that a HP intake during the first year of life (but within the EU recommended range) produces an increase in the subsequent BMI z-score (measured at 2 y), which may confer an increase in subsequent obesity risk ( [19](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR19)).\nNutritional factors are able to modulate cardiac function parameters. In animal models, exposure to an excess lipid intake can worsen heart remodeling, leading to contractile dysfunction (\n[20](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR20)) while, in elderly people, amino acid supplementation improved EF ( [18](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR18)). However, the effects of variation in protein intake on cardiac function in healthy neonates have not been studied. Our findings indicate that an increase in protein intake during the first year of life was associated with a subsequent increase in cardiac function parameters measured at 2 y of age. Specifically, the association with cardiac function was found with protein intake during the first month of life, rather than the intake closer to the time of cardiac function measurement. That such an effect of protein intake can be observed 1 y after the end of the intervention, would suggest a programming effect. As expected, we also observed a direct relationship between anthropometric variables and cardiac function parameters. Therefore, one could hypothesize that the effect of protein intake on cardiac function could be exerted indirectly through an anthropometric modulation of body size. This hypothesis would be in line with the proposed mechanism by which an increase in total body surface implies an increase in the cardiac output to fulfill the organism\u2019s higher O2 requirements ( [21](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR21)). Higher body weight implies higher energy expenditure and energy expenditure is tightly related to cardiac output. Accordingly, as in our study, protein intake would be associated to weight gain ( [6](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR6), [22](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR22), [23](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR23)) and, in which, weight gain as well as protein intake would be related to cardiac function. On the other hand, anthropometric measures were associated with energy expenditure and cardiac function. This suggests that an increase in body surface would be accompanied by a rise in cardiac output which, in turn, depends directly on the EF. Despite the evidence of an indirect effect of protein intake on cardiac function parameters via body size modulation, a direct effect on the cardiac system cannot be completely rejected since we had found that the type of formula was significantly associated with EF, even in the multiple regression models when adjusted for body size.\nCardiac mass has been shown to vary with dietary protein intake in pathologic situations such as protein-related malnutrition in humans (\n[24](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR24)) or overfeeding in rats ( [12](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR12)). In our study, the effect of early protein intake on the body-growth parameters was accompanied by the expected association of these parameters with the LVM ( [21](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR21), [25](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR25)). One of our objectives was to determine whether the protein supplied by milk formula during fast-growth periods could induce changes in cardiac structure, as evidence by changes in cardiac mass measured by echocardiography. We observed a slight increase in the LVM among those children receiving the HP formula during the first year of life, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. The lack of significance could be because of the limited sample size precluding the identification of subtle changes. The short time span over which the study was conducted may have contributed, as well. Our results suggest that an effect of protein intake on cardiac mass may be produced via modulation of body size and structure. The rationale for this conclusion was the direct correlation between anthropometric variables and LVM, but not with LVMI, as indexed by length.\nA possible protective effect of breastfeeding on later development of hypertension, secondary to a LP intake with human milk, has been proposed (\n[26](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR26)). In our study, we did not find significant differences in blood pressure measurements between the feeding groups, which may be influenced by the young age of the participants at the time of the cardiac study.\nRole of the IGF-1 Axis\nProtein intake has been directly associated with IGF-1 secretion (\n[27](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR27), [28](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR28)). This mechanism is partly responsible for the protein-induced increase in anthropometric parameters, as well as in some internal organs such as the kidney in healthy children ( [7](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR7), [29](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR29)). Protein intake induces IGF-1 secretion which, in turn, induces an increase in weight through its anabolic and metabolic effects in most cell lines ( [30](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR30), [31](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR31)). As cardiac growth and remodeling are also influenced by the IGF-1 in a physiologic as well as pathologic manner ( [32](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR32), [33](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR33), [34](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR34)), we sought relationships between these parameters. Our findings show that the HP group presented higher concentrations of free IGF-1 as well as lower concentrations of IGF-1 binding protein 2 (transport protein that inhibits the IGF-1 action) compared with LP and BF groups. IGF-1 concentrations were associated with weight and BMI at 6 mo, while free IGF-1 also correlated with these parameters at the age of 2 y. However, we did not find any relationship between IGF-1 axis parameters (neither total nor free IGF-1, nor its transport proteins) with cardiac mass.\nThe protein-induced increase in weight and size of certain organs produces a metabolic overload that implies an increase in cardiac output. Our results show a direct influence of protein intake on cardiac function parameters, suggesting a possible modulation towards an increase in IGF-1 and organ development resulting from the early protein intake. These changes could suggest an early programming effect, with changes in function resulting in subsequent structural changes. However, since the effect of the type of formula on cardiac function parameters remains significant even following adjustment for IGF-1 (total as well as free), our results are unable to distinguish whether an independent IGF-1 axis mechanism would still play a role.\nProtein-Induced Metabolic Consequences on the Cardiovascular System\nNutrient intakes during rapid-growth phases are able to affect body structure and function. The effect of protein supply during gestation and early infancy is one of the main nutritional factors that could modulate later risk of obesity and hypertension as well as kidney size and function (\n[4](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR4), [35](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR35)). Our results suggest that this mechanism is also able to influence the cardiac system through an indirect mechanism via overall growth of the body, accompanied by an increased metabolic expenditure (i.e., energy expenditure) and a consequent increased cardiac workload. Possibly, cardiac workload or whatever involves increased O2 requirements in children with greater body surface can determine the long-term increase in cardiac mass, as evidenced in obese individuals ( [36](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR36)). However, we are unable to explore this hypothesis in the 2-y olds because of the short time course of the study encompassing a short developmental period and the low prevalence of obese infants observed at this age. We would not expect this slight change in cardiac mass to exert health effects on healthy children. However, long-term effects if overweight persists would require further investigation. Consequently, if health consequences could be predicted by the formula diets administered to the infants, then it would be important to revise infant formula regulations. [\nFigure 5\n](/articles/pr201630#Fig5) presents a rationale to explain our findings, particularly the main steps involved in the early-phase period. The increase in early protein intake could induce an increase in IGF-1 that produced an increase in body mass with the corresponding raise in energy expenditure. A posterior adrenergic response in the sympathetic system could mediate an increase in the cardiac output, observed as increases in cardiac function parameters. These mechanisms have potential long-term effects. However, we are unable to extrapolate our findings to later-stage developments.\nA potential limitation of this study is the exclusion of blood pressure measurements from 32 infants (23% of the participants) due to insufficient or unreliable measurements/readings. However, there were no significant differences in the excluded infants with respect to feeding-group distributions. A further limitation is that the IGF-1 axis determinations were performed in a single blood sample. This was unavoidable since repeated blood sampling in infants is difficult to achieve. Another limitation is sample size. The study sample did not provide sufficient statistical power to detect slight differences in cardiac mass between the feeding groups. Despite these limitations, the study provides new data obtained in a group of healthy infants that had been randomized at birth to receive infant formula diets. Confidence in the measurements was assured by high-standard anthropometric measurement protocols and echocardiographic assessment by a single expert clinical cardiologist who was blinded with respect to the dietary provenance of the infants.\nIn summary, our study demonstrated that a moderate increase in protein intake during the first year of life is associated not only with higher BMI but also higher cardiac function parameters at 2 y of age. However, we did not find changes in cardiac mass at this early stage of the child\u2019s development. The IGF-1 axis may partly mediate these effects by an indirect pathway that induces changes in the body size as well as on energy expenditure. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the clinical applications of this nutritional programming effect in infancy.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Population Sample\nThe study was performed in the Spanish subsample of infants from the EU Childhood Obesity Program trial. This study is an ongoing European collaborative randomized controlled trial in five European countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Spain) investigating the long-term consequences of different protein intakes during the first year of life (\n[6](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR6)). The double-blinded randomized, clinical trial [NTC00338689] comparing two groups of infants fed, during the first year of life, either HP or LP content formulas; both within the recommended range for desired growth and development. The primary aim of the clinical trial was to evaluate the influence of this variation in protein intake on early growth and subsequent obesity. A nonrandomized group of infants exclusively BF during the first 3 mo of life was followed up as a reference group.\nDietary intake and growth parameters were assessed periodically during the first 2 y of life (\n[6](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR6), [37](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR37)). A blood sample was taken at 6 mo of age. Echocardiography and blood pressure measurements were performed at the age of 2 y.\nInfant formulas had a percentage of the energy content provided by proteins of 7.1 vs. 11.7% (1.25 g/100 ml vs. 2.05 g/100 ml for LP and HP, respectively), and follow-on formulas provided 8.8 vs. 17.6% of energy content (1.6 g/100 ml vs. 3.2 g/100 ml for LP and HP, respectively). Equal energy content in both study formulas was achieved by increasing the fat content in the LP formula. Carbohydrates and other nutrients were not significantly different. Further details on the study formulas and protocols have been published elsewhere (\n[6](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR6)). The composition of all study formulas complied with the 1991 European Union Directive on Infant and Follow-on Formulae ( [38](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR38)) in place at the time of the study. The protein contents represented approximately the lowest and highest levels of the range recommended in this directive.\nAssessments\nAnthropometry\nWeight was measured using a Seca 702 scale with a precision of \u00b10.05 kg (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Recumbent length was measured at birth using Seca 232 (Seca) and a PED LB 35\u2013107 X (Ellard Instrumentation, Monreo, WA); both with a precision of \u00b11 mm at the age of 24 mo. Body mass index:\nwere calculated (\n[39](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR39)). Weight-gain per month and length-gain per month from birth to 2 y were calculated. All anthropometric variables were transformed into z-scores, according to the World Health Organization Standards ( [40](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR40)) using the WHO Anthro for personal computers software (World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland).\nBlood Analyses\nSerum parameters analyzed at 6 mo of age were: total IGF-1 (ng/mL), free IGF-1 (ng/mL), IGF-1 binding protein 2 (ng/mL), and IGF-1 binding protein 3 (ng/mL). Serum samples were frozen at \u221270 \u00baC until analyzed in a centralized laboratory in Warsaw (Children\u2019s Memorial Health Institute, Warsaw, Poland) (\n[41](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR41)). The IGF-1 axis analyses were performed by radioimmunoassay using commercial kits according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX).\nCardiac Assessment\nTransthoracic Doppler echocardiography was performed by a single pediatric cardiologist (R.C.) to assess cardiac mass and function. The device used was VIVID 4 with a 5-MHz transductor allowing bidimensional M-mode evaluation (General Electrics, New York, NY). The following parameters were measured in triplicate: interventricular septum thickness in systole, interventricular septum thickness in diastole, left ventricular posterior wall in systole, left ventricular posterior wall in diastole, left ventricular diastolic diameter, left ventricular systolic diameter. Calculated variables were: LVM (g), LVMI as LVM (g)/length (m)2.7, EF (%) and SF (%). LVM was calculated according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography as modified by Devereux as follows:\nwhere dIVS is the interventricular septum thickness in diastole, dLVD is the left ventricular diastolic diameter, and dLVPW is the left ventricular posterior wall in diastole. LVMI was calculated as recommended by de Simone (\n[25](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR25), [42](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR42)) as: LVMI = LVM/length2.7.\nCardiac function was evaluated using M-mode echocardiographic examination to determine left ventricular systolic function. EF and SF were calculated digitally using the Teicholz method (\n[43](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR43)).\nAll echocardiographic measurements were performed according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography (\n[43](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR43)).\nAt the 2-y visit, blood pressure measurements were performed in triplicate using the oscillometric monitor Dinamap Pro 300 (precision: \u00b18 mmHg). The mean value was used in the statistical analyses. The appropriate cuff was applied with the subject in sitting position on the mother\u2019s lap. Not being able to obtain three valid blood pressure measurements was a criterion to remove this variable from the statistical analyses.\nTotal Energy Expenditure Assessment\nTotal energy expenditure as kcal/d was calculated using the Schofield equations (\n[44](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR44)) below for basal metabolic rate:\nor\nfor boys and girls, respectively. The total energy expenditure was then calculated using the physical activity levels as described by Butte et al (\n[45](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR45)) at 2 y as:\nData Analysis\nData management and statistical analyses were carried out with the SPSS Statistics software package version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Descriptive results are presented as frequencies for categorical variables and as mean (\u00b1SD) for continuous variables. Frequency distributions between feeding types were compared with the \u03c72 test. Anthropometry, blood variables as well as cardiac mass and function between dietary formulas were compared with Student\u2019s t-test or Mann\u2013Whitney U-test (for normally and non-normally distributed variables, respectively) or by ANOVA analysis and Bonferroni post hoc correction for multiple testing when BF infants were also included in the analyses. Linear associations between cardiac variables and the other continuous variables were analyzed by Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients, as appropriate. Linear regression models were applied to evaluate the effect of feeding type on cardiac mass and function. Adjustment was performed using anthropometric variables. Also, linear regression models were applied to determine the effect of daily protein intake during first mo of life on cardiac variables, and on body weight or BMI. Statistical significance was accepted at the level of P < 0.05.\nEthical Considerations\nThe local Ethical Committees approved the study. All study procedures conformed to the Helsinki II declaration. Written informed parental consent was obtained for each infant. Data were codified to ensure anonymity.\nStatement of Financial Support\nThe studies reported herein have been carried out with partial financial support from the European Union, within the 5th Framework Programme (research grant number QLRT\u20132001\u201300389 and number QLK1-CT-2002\u201330582), the 6th Framework Programme (contract number 007036), and the 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2008\u20132013) (under grant agreement number 212652) (NUTRIMENTHE Project \u201cThe Effect of Diet on the Mental Performance of Children\u201d and (FP7/2007\u20132013), under the grant agreement number 289346 (project EarlyNutrition)). This manuscript does not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission and in no way anticipates the future policy in this area.\nInvestigators and their institutions in the European Childhood Obesity Project Group are included in the Acknowledgments.\nDisclosure\nThe authors affirm that there is no potential conflict of interest and that there were no financial ties to products in the study.\nReferences\nLucas A.
