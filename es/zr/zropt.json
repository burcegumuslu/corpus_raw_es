As a resultof this collective effort it has been possible to draw up a detailed picture of the profession which hasbeen described and defined in the new training programme.\nThe process of putting together the training programme and obtaining its approval by the National\nCommission for Family and Community Medicine, the National Medical Speciality Council, the HumanResources Commission of the Interterritorial Council of the Spanish National Health System, the Min-istry of Health and Consumer Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture, posed a challenge tofamily doctors: this challenge has resulted in the creation of a tool which is more than just educa-tional and is intended to give a significant boost to the growth of Family and Community Medicine with-in the Spanish National Health System.\nThe implementation of the new specialist training programme for family medicine registrars beginning\ntheir training from 2005 onwards, creates an opportunity for the future. Family doctors will start toemerge with greater abilities to solve problems and take decisions across the whole health care sys-tem. Furthermore, the new family medicine registrars will demand more of their tutors: because anextra year of training means more involvement, the need to offer greater and improved content andto study new ways to develop learning. The training units are vital components in the system and willparticipate in the entire process. In this way the new programme will help us all to grow, will have agreater influence on the health system and will help solve more of the community\u2019s problems. Inshort, there is an opportunity to achieve a more global objective: not just better family doctors, buta greater potential to turn our health system towards a health-focused model.\nThe new programme presents guidelines that will help us to orient health care towards the provision\nof interventions for which there is better scientific evidence. This is the kind of health care that focus-es on the community and its needs. It is the health care that maintains a balance between curativeinterventions, health promotion and disease prevention. It is a health care that adopts an integrated,holistic, biopsychosocial approach and whose professionals are committed to the community as awhole, to the social needs of the local environment and to resources and their management. It is thiscommitment of our speciality, its spirit and its values, that are gathered together in the new pro-gramme. \nBut from now on, the implementation of this programme will require us to start work on its evalua-\ntion and continuous improvement. Above all, it will require that we consider the future of the special-ity again. This future will be to respond to the needs arising in the health system and which familydoctors will be able to meet in a more integrated way because of the new programme.\nIn the hope that this edition of the new specialist training programme will enable us all to consult and\nuse it, I would like to end my foreword by thanking the thousands of family doctors who work every-day in delivering the characteristic care that defines the speciality of Family and Community Medicine,for their devotion to their profession and the undeniable contribution they make to the developmentof Family Medicine.\nLuis Aguilera Garc\u00eda\nPresident of the semFYCPrologue|IIIII00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina III00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina IVThe new Family and Community Medicine Programme is the result of a firm desire to consolidate the\nteaching base and the values of Family and Community Medicine and a deep commitment to training.The four years spent developing the different phases of the Programme and the collaboration of manyfamily doctors bear witness to this commitment. New areas have been included, areas specific to thediscipline have been consolidated, new teaching and evaluative methodologies have been introduced,priorities and levels of responsibility have been established and learning environments have beendiversified and expanded. Rather than being simply a post-graduate training manual, this documentconstitutes a framework outlining the essential competencies of a family doctor. This is the frame-work for the academic discipline and professional development. \nIn short, the programme is a reference tool and as such, it must be dynamic and answer and adapt\nto people\u2019s needs. This tool represents a quantitative and qualitative change and we hope it will con-tribute to improving and consolidating Family and Community Medicine and Primary Care.\nA change in content is one of the most important qualitative changes. We have added professional\nvalues, defined and specified the professional profile, defined essential, cross-cutting and specificcompetencies, and adapted the programme to social and healthcare needs. We have placed specialemphasis on those competencies considered \u201cspecific\u201d to family doctors, namely family and commu-nity care, and examined them in greater depth. Competencies for education, training and researchhave also been developed. \nThe programme is not only aimed at training family doctors who are going to work in health centres\nin the future, but also, due to its wide scope it serves as a basis for subsequent training in other areas,such as emergency care, palliative care, family care, etc, or so that doctors can work in other set-tings, such as accident and emergency departments or other services in both public and private care.Qualitative improvements have been made to the methods involved; individualised training has beenincluded with a gradual increase in responsibility; greater emphasis has been placed on on-going train-ing by tutors, involving continuous assessment. The tutors must be able to adapt to the required com-petency areas and training methodologies; it is therefore important that the health administration guar-antees and facilitates opportunities for trainers to maintain and improve their skills, and providesexcellent conditions for healthcare training and to maintain motivation. \nThe educational methodology is examined in greater depth. It is based on self-directed learning, learn-\ning in context, in the classroom, group work and workshops. The first two are fundamental, and theothers complementary, depending on whether it is a question of acquiring new knowledge, learningskills or improving attitudes.\nThe health centre provides the central training environment for Family and Community Medicine, but\nthere has been an expansion in the training environments: short-stay medical units, home hospitali-sation units, accident and emergency units, teenage healthcare units, palliative care units, health-care units for immigrants, drug addicts, victims of violence (women, the older adults, children, etc.)and rural health centres.\nWe have stated on several occasions that this programme is, and will probably continue for some\ntime to be best known for increasing the training time from three to four years rather than for qual-itative changes in training. Nevertheless it is the qualitative changes and only these changes whichdictated the need for increased training time, to correspond to the minimum total training time rec-ommended by the experts who drew up the programme.\nA great many people have taken part in this process, including family doctors and other profession-\nals: the two national commissions and bodies they represent, the Ministry of Health and ConsumerAffairs and the Ministry of Education and Science, the scientific societies semFYC and SEMERGEN,the Organisation of Medical Colleges of Spain (OMC), family medicine registrars, the 11 members ofthe editorial committee, 83 writers, 153 editors and the members of the initial Delphi group; bothboards of directors of semFYC, presided by Vicen\u00e7 Thomas and Luis Aguilera, who have worked onevery phase of this long process; their working groups; the National Medical Speciality Council [CNE]and its commissions; the members of the Human Resources Commission and many people with go-vernment responsibilities, including Ministers Ana Pastor and Elena Salgado, who have made a firmand decisive commitment to the programme, the Directors of Human Resources, Jaume Aubi\u00e1 andIntroduction|VIV00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina VConsuelo S\u00e1nchez, the deputy Directors of Professional Regulation, Marc Soler, Emilia S\u00e1nchez\nChamorro (subsequently from her post as Deputy Director of Healthcare Science Specialities) andJavier Rubio, who have been the linchpins in the development and approval of this programme; Alfon-so Moreno (president of the National Council of Medical Specialities; the representatives of the healthcentres, and in particular, Nela Garc\u00eda, councillor at the Sub-Head Office for Professional Regulationof the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs, who has played a vital role in drawing up and approv-ing the final version of the programme. Although they are not mentioned in the list of authors we aredeeply grateful for the work and support of members of the CNE, as well as many other anonymousprofessionals who, due to lack of space or an oversight on our part have not been included in thelist, but have collaborated in the design phase, as well as in the drawing up and approval of the pro-gramme and are now working with energy and determination on its implementation and development.\nA great many things remain to be done. We must work on the accreditation and reaccreditation cri-\nteria for coordinators and tutors, on the assessment of teaching skills, on our information and com-munications systems, on research, on training tutors, on structured and on-going tutoring systems,on training assessment and skills-development analysis systems, on the training units, their organi-sation, functions, structure, management of training, coordination between trainers and trainingstructures.\nBut above all, we now have to make \u00abour programme\u00bb a reality and this is the responsibility of each\none of us.\nVer\u00f3nica Casado\nPresident of the National Commission \nfor Family and Community MedicineFamily and Community Medicine \nTraining Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina VIGuide to Specialist Education\n> National Commission for Family\nand Community Medicine\n> Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs \n> Ministry of Education and ScienceFamily and Community \nMedicine TrainingProgramme\nA new  educational programme lasting four years, applicable solely to Registrars\nin Family and Community Medicine beginning their training as from the2004/2005.\nThe previous programme will continue to apply to registrars who began their train-\ning programmes earlier and are currently in training.\nMadrid, 17th January 200500 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina VII00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina VIIIFamily and Community Medicine\nSpecialist Training Programme\nNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEDICINE\nMINISTRY OF HEALTH AND CONSUMER AFFAIRSMINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE\n1.

These changes have led to the introduction of activities spe-cific to primary health care such as: work in multidisciplinary teams with longer working hours, med-ical history and clinical activity recording, the incorporation of new skills and complementary investi-gations (blood analyses, radiology, spirometery, ECG), the introduction of  clinical protocols andhealthcare guidelines.  At the same time preventive care and health promotion are being addressedthrough training and research in primary care. \nA number of major social changes have occurred in this country in recent years which have led to an\nincrease in the use of primary care services. These changes include an increase in the elderly popu-lation and in chronic pathologies, changes in family structure and other lifestyle and  environmentalfactors that have created new health care needs and public expectations. The major growth in pri-mary health care also stems from the better range and quality of services, that result from scienti-fic and technological development and improved training and diagnostic skills of family doctors (FDs).\nThis new Family and Community Medicine Training Programme represents a major milestone: it is\nthe third official programme and the fifth actual programme in the 24 years since the speciality wascreated, providing proof of the strength and dynamism of family doctors in Spain.\nDespite the fact that Family and Community Medicine is a relatively young speciality, it has become\nfirmly established and widespread in the healthcare system. This is borne out by the fact that over18,000 specialists were trained in 2002, and 5,400 are currently in training. This quantitativebreakthrough has been accompanied by a qualitative one, illustrated by the wealth of magazines,books, monographs, courses, workshops, working groups, congresses, research and teaching activ-ities etc., by family doctors.\nFrom an organisational point of view, the programme has been developed  with a high level of con-\nsensus, as shown by the long list of authors/collaborators included in appendix II. It took over twoyears to develop the programme and during this time, Family and Community Medicine (FCM) Train-ing Departments and the speciality\u2019s most representative Scientific Societies participated actively,particularly the Spanish Society for Family and Community Medicine (SemFYC).\nOf particular interest to our neighbouring countries is the fact that the current programme has\nextended the training period to four years, as has also happened in other European countries suchas Austria, Denmark and Finland. In this way it is approaching the recommendations proposed by theEuropean Union of General Practitioners and the European Parliament which even advise extendingthis period to five years. \nWith regard to the contents of the programme, it is relevant to highlight that these meet the pres-\nent and future needs of primary health care by allowing the flexible and individual adaptation of workrotations to meet the levels of skill required of a professional family doctor. Minimum, desirable andmaximum standards have been established for learning objectives which allow a quality assessmentof the entire process. \nHealth Centre tutors, who are responsible for following up and supervising the activities carried out\nby the family medicine registrars throughout their four-year training period, play a central role in thisprogramme which must be supported simultaneously by a complementary programme of tutor train-ing in order to maintain and improve their skills.\nThe Programme develops five areas of competence: essential skills (communication, clinical reason-\ning, healthcare management and bioethics), individual patient care, family health care, communityhealth care and continuing education and research.\nPrimary health care must be the cornerstone of the health system and this means that high quality\ntraining of the family doctors of the future is fundamental, so that they can provide better, moreaccessible, more humane, more integrated and more efficient care for the health service user. Thiscontinues to be the challenge facing family doctors as trainers, together with their concerns for|\n1Background3200 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 3future working conditions, professional career development, continuing education, skills certification\nand recertification, support for tutors and the development of new teaching methodologies etc. thatcreate the indivisible whole that guarantees quality training and the best medical care for the public. \nThis Programme seeks to provide a dynamic tool, as its predecessors did. This means that it will be\nrevised periodically in order to adapt to the changing needs of scientific developments and of our soci-ety.\nThe National Commission for Family and Community Medicine wishes to express its sincere thanks\nto everyone who has taken part in developing this programme, as well as all the family doctors whocontribute on a daily basis to the progress of this speciality.Family and Community Medicine \nTraining Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 4Profound changes and new phenomena taking place in society today are making new demands on\nhealth which family doctors cannot ignore. In the face of these changes, their function in society mustnot only focus on improving their levels of training and providing the services required of them, butalso on promoting the values which legitimise their role in society.\n2.1. The professional values of the family doctor\nDoctors possess values which define their professional commitment to society. Learning and theinternalisation of these values are indispensable if they are to do their job properly. \nTeaching , trans-\nmitting these values, is part of a tutor\u2019s job; learning and assimilating them are essential if a family\nmedicine registrar is to become a good family doctor.\nWe can group the values of family doctors into five commitments:\u2022 To people.\n\u2022 To society as a whole.\u2022 To the continuous improvement of their work.\u2022 To their own speciality.\u2022 To ethics.\n2.1.1. A commitment to people\nThe individual citizen is the central focus of the care provided by the family doctor, whose interven-\ntions are geared to improving and maintaining the individual\u2019s health and which take priority over anyother interests. The public understands the nature of the profession and every effort is made to gainpublic trust so that people will always consult the doctor whenever they need to do so. The best fam-ily doctors endeavour to improve health outcomes of the population for whom they are responsible. \nRespecting the autonomy of the citizen is not just an ethical duty, but also a healthcare objective . The\nfamily doctor provides the necessary information so that patients themselves can decide, in collabo-ration with the doctor, their preferred course of treatment. In this respect, the promotion of patientautonomy in caring for themselves, is an essential healthcare objective. Ideally, family doctors shouldmake every effort to ensure their patients achieve such levels of autonomy that they no longer needthem. Their purpose is not to become indispensable to their patients, but to help them learn to lookafter themselves.\nEvery individual matters to the family doctor throughout their entire lives. The doctor\u2019s job is not\nrestricted to clinical cases or to dealing with illnesses, but their daily work also involves attending topeople with specific problems and beliefs, who are immersed \nin a family and social context which con-\nstitutes an indivisible whole .\n2.1.2. A commitment to society\nFamily doctors act as a gateway to the healthcare system, or rather as healthcare agents for thecommunity, or case managers and care pathway coordinators, and as such they have a high level ofsocial responsibility with regard to the efficient use of healthcare resources. They know that the inap-propriate use of healthcare resources (a drug, a complementary investigation, a consultation withanother doctor, etc.) not only represents an iatrogenic risk for the patient, but is also an unneces-sary expense which deprives the population of other resources. This is why family doctors have asocial commitment to the \nefficient use of healthcare resources and to actively avoid discrimination in\naccess to healthcare services. |54\n2The professional values and profile\nof the family doctor00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 5As frontline healthcare professionals, family doctors must guarantee rapid medical attention for\nthose people who require it, avoiding the creation of barriers which hinder access to their servicesor direct access to other more specialised services. To this end, family doctors endeavour to orga-nise their own and their collegues\u2019 workload so that they can meet public demand without delay.\nFamily doctors \nknow the importance of their role within the healthcare system, but they perform it\nwith humility, because they are aware of the influence of health care on social and economic factors,and for this reason they \nidentify and work to improve the living conditions of the population they care\nfor.\n2.1.3. A commitment to continuous improvement\nFamily doctors make their decisions based on updated scientific evidence and must therefore keep\ntheir knowledge, skills and professional attitudes up to date, recognising the value of their team andminimising the possibilities of mistakes by maintaining continuous improvement and a scientific com-mitment to the speciality.\nThe professional profile of family doctors and their commitment to people, society and continuous\nimprovement, make them \nessential professionals in the smooth running of the  health system.\n2.1.4. A commitment to their own speciality and the training \nof new professionals \nThe diversity, cross-sectionality and uncertainty with which family doctors work continually are not\nconsidered a limitation but an inherent characteristic of the speciality and an incentive to playing anactive role in the development, consolidation and updating of the training base of this speciality.\nFamily doctors know that improvements can be made to their speciality and this is why they \nvalue and\ntake part in training new family medicine registrars , to whom they convey everything they know with-\nout limitations, thereby helping the new specialists to be even better than they are .\nAs the tutors of new professionals, family doctors help new generations of family medicine registrars\nto learn, knowing that they themselves learn from the training process.\nThe family doctors\u2019 commitment to their speciality also determines their willingness to research those\nquestions that are relevant to their job, in order to offer a better service to society.\n2.1.5. An ethical commitment \nFamily doctors are very exacting with the healthcare administration and other actors in the health-care system and call for it to be run properly. The limitations of the system do not prevent them frommaintaining an irreproachable \nethical attitude in their relationships with their patients, with society as\na whole, with the healthcare organisation they work for and with the pharmaceutical industry. \nThe family doctor\u2019s ethical commitment is based above all, on respect for the patient\u2019s autonomy ,\nguaranteeing their right to privacy and the confidentiality of their treatment. In their clinical interven-\ntions and taking into account their area of work, they put the principle of no-harm before the princi-\nple of beneficence of the patient.\nFamily doctors must be particularly careful and honest in their relationships with the pharmaceuticalindustry and in their teaching and research, making sure they put the needs of their patients beforetheir own legitimate interests.Family and Community Medicine \nTraining Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 62.2. The professional profile of the family doctor \nThe family doctor\u2019s profile is that of a professional for whom the person is a physical, psycholog-\nical and social whole, embedded in  a specific family and social context. This approach enables\nthe doctor to give continuing care to his or her patients, to improve the health of the healthy,\ncure the sick and to give care, advice  and palliation for the effects of the illness, when it is not\npossible for patients to regain their health.\nThese specific characteristics of the family doctors\u2019 professional profile shape a particular body ofknowledge that is fundamentally grounded in their area of activity \u2013  Primary Health Care, and theirparticular approach to providing care. This approach adopts a biopsychosocial focus in which themain driver is the integration of curative interventions with health promotion, disease prevention,rehabilitation and palliative care. \nFor educational purposes, this professional profile is represented by the following five areas of com-\npetency, which have a high level of consensus in the European Union.\n2.2.1. Training area for essential competencies: communication, \nclinical reasoning, management and bioethics \nFamily doctors\u2019 main tool is their ability to communicate with the patients they see every day. It is\ntherefore vital that they develop the ability to listen and empathise so that they can relate to usersin the right way.\nFamily doctors usually see patients with ill-defined health problems, presenting in the early stages of\nthe disease process and which are frequently trivial. This means that they must have the appropri-ate reasoning skills that will allow them to detect more serious conditions by making an accurate diag-nosis from a very vague complaint. Protocols and clinical guidelines, which family medicine registrarsthemselves participate in developing and using, can be a very useful aid in learning clinical reasoningand decision-making skills.\nFamily doctors work as part of a team of primary healthcare professionals who have shared objec-\ntives and care for the same population group. This means they have to learn how to work in a teamand to identify and set common objectives, as well as establishing methods of working and commu-nication between the different professionals involved in health care provision.\nTo carry out their work properly, family doctors must learn how to organise the different aspects of\ntheir working day, including the efficient running of their surgery and the appropriate and effectiveuse of clinical investigations, therapeutic resources and referrals to other specialists. \nIn primary health care, information is the basis of knowledge for diagnosis and decision-making and\nfamily doctors must be able to use relevant registers, information and technology systems appropri-ately, ensuring that all data remains confidential. \nLearning evidence based medicine and the use of Internet resources are fundamental tools in the\nfield of clinical management.\nFamily doctors will learn the theoretical framework and scope of quality in health care and the tools\nfor assessing the structure, process and outcome measures by which quality can be identified andimproved. The application of these evaluation and improvement techniques will enable them to assessthe levels of satisfaction of both users and professionals with their work. \nFamily doctors must have the necessary know-how to perform basic administrative and managerial\ntasks in primary care centres.\nDuring their training period, family doctors will learn to include the ethical values and attitudes of the\nprofession in their working procedures, both in terms of their relationship with their patients (respect,|7600 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 7privacy, confidentiality, autonomy, informed consent), and in other areas of their professional duties\n(prescription, distribution of resources, research, their relationship with the pharmaceutical industry,etc.).\n2.2.2. Training area for competencies in individual patient care\nFamily doctors are fundamentally good clinicians who must effectively and efficiently provide continu-ous care for individuals throughout their lives, both at the surgery and in the home, through appoint-ments, on demand or in emergencies and for acute and chronic complaints.\nHolistic care (for the whole person) and longitudinality (throughout their lives) are two essential char-\nacteristics of family doctors\u2019 professional role. They construct a picture of their patients\u2019 medical his-tories from a viewpoint that integrates the biological, psychological and social aspects of health careand illness.\nFamily doctors will acquire the technical skills to make a correct diagnosis, by processing and assess-\ning the diagnostic tests available to them, and ensuring that they have the necessary skills to carryout each individual healthcare procedure:\n\u2022 A diagnostic plan that includes making a correct differential diagnosis, a correct interpretation of\nadditional investigations and if necessary, the inclusion of the opinions of other specialists.\n\u2022 A pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment plan, which will be drawn up and discussed\nwith the patient, using the drugs and other therapies available to family doctors correctly.\n\u2022 A follow-up plan assessing adherence to treatment and the results achieved, guaranteeing continu-\nous and specific care in particular situations such as individuals with disabilities, people with mobil-ity difficulties, the terminally ill who require palliative care, as well as children, adolescents, women,older adults etc.\nIn their contact with the patient, family doctors will also assess the need and opportunities for inte-\ngrating evidence based, disease prevention and health promotion interventions into healthcare prac-tice. This includes adopting measures for health education and for the primary and secondary pre-vention of the most common conditions in the population, such as infectious diseases, cancer,cardiovascular disease, mental health, and for health problems in children and adolescents, women,older adults etc.\nFamily doctors have to develop the appropriate skills so that during the clinical consultation  they can\nestablish a good rapport with the patient which can enable them to ascertain the specific reason forattendance and the underlying health problem in question, while maintaining absolute respect for thepatient\u2019s privacy, confidentiality and autonomy. \n2.2.3. Training area for competencies in family health care\nThe family plays an important role in the way its members fall ill and the type of illnesses they deve-lop. Family doctors must understand each family as a unit operating in two different ways: as a partof the social context in which life and health unfold, and as a healthcare resource. \nThe family medicine registrar must see the family as a system, undertake a family consultation, draw\nup and interpret the genogram, know about the life cycle of the family, the transition stages andstressful life events, assessing them and being aware of their repercussions.\nIt is important for family doctors to acquire skills that enable them to advise, intervene in, and medi-\nate with families. They should know how to identify family resources and the social support networkthat people and their families have, as well as how to recognise psychosocial dysfunction and prob-lems originating in the family.Family and Community Medicine \nTraining Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 82.2.4. Training area for competencies in community health care\nIn order to improve health and reduce inequalities, family doctors must act on the physical and social\ndeterminants of health that are outside the context of the healthcare system.\nThe community dimension of a family doctor\u2019s work starts from his or her care of the individual\npatient and all activity must be contextualised within the person\u2019s family and social milieu, making themost of these resources and minimising their weaknesses. \nWith this aim in mind, family doctors must obtain enough information to identify the population\u2019s\nhealthcare needs, focusing their attention on the entire community and identifying at-risk groupswhich because of their social class, gender, ethnic background, age, etc., suffer from inequalities inhealth care. This includes organising and implementing interventions to address community healthproblems and enabling the most vulnerable to access the healthcare system.\nWhen providing health care for the community, family doctors must learn on the one hand to use epi-\ndemiological monitoring systems by which they can monitor environmental risks and their healthrepercussions, and on the other, to cooperate actively with community organisations (NGOs, mutualassistance associations, etc.) and other institutions that seek to improve the health of the popula-tion.\n2.2.5. Training area for competencies in education and research \nThe family doctor must participate in a process of continuing education to constantly maintain andimprove professional competence. This involves acquiring the necessary skills to prepare and deliverclinical, bibliographical and review training sessions, etc, as well as collaborating in under-graduateand post-graduate training in family medicine. \nFamily doctors will learn how to perform a literature search, familiarise themselves with the medical\ndatabases, information and document resources and how to obtain evidence based information. \nFamily doctors must be able to assess the quality and importance of the research results published\nin scientific journals, develop the habit of critical reading and the basic knowledge to undertake aresearch project geared to answering questions and hypotheses resulting from their work. They mustacquire the characteristic knowledge and methods of clinical epidemiology and evidence based med-icine [EBM] so that they can analyse the health of the community for which the basic healthcare team(family doctor and nurse) is responsible.|9800 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 900 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 103.1. Links with the professional profile of the family doctor \nIn order to guarantee that the Family and Community Medicine specialist can meet the health\ndemands of today\u2019s society, this programme is closely linked to the professional profile of the familydoctor. For this reason the contents of the training programme are divided into training areas whichin turn coincide with the competencies referred to in paragraph 2.2.\n3.2. Flexibility\nThe flexibility of this programme is clearly shown by the following characteristics:\n\u2022 Learning methods: the acquisition of skills by the family medicine registrar is always the final objec-\ntive and not the method whereby such skills are acquired. \u201c The important thing is the \u2018what\u2019 andnot the \u2018how\u2019\u201d;  as a result it is envisaged that different learning methods will be used in the differ-ent training areas according to what best suits the educational profile of the tutors and the spe-cific characteristics of the training unit where the family medicine registrar is being trained. \n\u2022 Versatility of the training: the Family and Community Medicine Programme provides the necessary\nknowledge to enable doctors to work, not only in health centres, which provide the natural environ-ment for FM, but in other working environments, where they are particularly in demand (such asthe emergency services, hospital accident and emergency departments, prison health care etc.).\n\u2022 Increase in training venues: in order to improve and broaden the education of family medicine re-\ngistrars the training programme is open to the inclusion of new types of training resources suchas: short-stay medical units, hospital-at-home services, teenage healthcare units, palliative careunits, as well as the essential inclusion of rural health centres because of  the specific nature offamily medicine practice in this setting. \n\u2022 Elective internships: assessment of training before the end of the third year will make it possible\nto determine the level of competence acquired. The elective internships last for three months andwill enable registrars to rectify any shortcomings in their competencies.\n\u2022 The individualised training of each family medicine registrar with a gradual increase in responsibi-\nlity tailored to each doctor\u2019s personal characteristics.\n3.3. The relationship between tutor and family medicine registrar\nThis relationship is the fundamental core of the entire training process, in that the internship systeminvolves programmed and tutored theoretical and practical training, with the specialist participating\nin a personal and progressive way in the registrar\u2019s training in the relevant interventions and respon-sibilities.\nTutors should not only have a sound knowledge of the subject, but must also be available and acces-\nsible during every phase of the training period, as they play an important role as facilitators and medi-ators of the learning process. \nThe importance of the role of the tutor is demonstrated by the fact that the registrar has the same\nprincipal tutor, with whom they will remain in continuous and structured contact throughout theentire learning period, This does not however detract from the role of other tutors or the hospitaltutor, depending on the place where training is taking place at any given time.\nThe principal tutor is responsible for adapting the individual training plan to the training needs and\npersonal characteristics of each registrar, in order to rectify any shortcomings detected during theirinternship.|1110\n3General characteristics\nof the Family and Community Medicine Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 113.4. The link between interventions during the training period \nand levels of priority and responsibility \nThis programme is particularly important because its training contents are not just restricted to a\nsimple list of skills, knowledge and aptitudes, but they also provide a useful tool to help both tutor andregistrar to assess the importance and the level of responsibility the registrar must acquire for eachof the interventions programmed at each stage of the training process.\nTo this effect, the tables of contents for each area of competence indicate the level of priority and\nresponsibility for each activity, as follows: \nLevels of priority:\n\u2022 Priority I: indispensable: these competencies must be acquired by all family medicine registrars.\nAbsence of these raises questions about ability. \n\u2022 Priority II: important: these competencies must be acquired by the majority of family medicine re-\ngistrars.\n\u2022 Priority III: excellence: if the previous levels have been achieved, the acquisition of these compe-\ntencies may be a criterion of excellence.\nLevels of responsibility:\n\u2022 Primary level: the family doctor must be able to identify, assess and manage this type of problem,\nand in 90% of cases without referral to another level of health care.\n\u2022 Secondary level: referral to another level is usually required during the assessment or treatment\nof this type of problem.\n\u2022 Tertiary level: the diagnosis and treatment of these problems fall within the competencies of other\nspecialists, but the family doctor must be able to inform and support the patient and their familyand ensure the coordination and continuity of care.\n3.5. The importance of assessment \nEvery training programme involves a complex learning process, whose validity and dynamism dependon the extent to which quality criteria are used to evaluate all component parts, with the aim ofdetecting, improving and correct shortcomings as necessary.\nThis is the intention of section 14 of this programme, which contains evaluation and assessment cri-\nteria for family medicine registrars, the teaching staff involved in their training and the structurewhich makes the process possible, including this training programme.\n3.6. Bibliographical and Internet-resource guide \nOne of the core values and approaches of this programme, is to convey to family medicine registrarsthat self-directed learning as well as the expansion and updating of knowledge, is a vital element intraining specialists in Family and Community Medicine that does not end after four years\u2019 internship,but represents a permanent professional commitment by the family doctor. \nFor this reason, a bibliographical and Internet-resource guide related to Family Medicine, is given in\nsection 16 and listed in Appendix I. The guide will be updated periodically by the National Commissionfor Family and Community Medicine on this web-site for this programme, by adding new reviews ofthe most important publications from the scientific literature in general and from family doctors them-selves. Family doctors can submit their contributions to the National Commission, which will includethem on the website following a selection process.Family and Community Medicine \nTraining Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 12As we stated earlier, one of the specific characteristics of this programme is the diversity of learn-\ning methods, because the priority is that family medicine registrars fulfil the objectives of the pro-gramme, despite its broad contents, the variety of profiles of tutors/registrars and the diverse char-acteristics and resources of the many training units accredited to train these specialists.\nTo this effect, the five recommended learning methods in the different areas of competence of this\nprogramme are:\n4.1. Self-directed learning\n\u2022 This involves: the study and use of individual learning tools.\n\u2022 It is particularly suitable for: acquiring new knowledge, maintaining competencies, acquiring skills\nin the use of basic tools (English, computers, Internet).\n\u2022 Different models:\n\u2013 Everyday study on the registrar\u2019s initiative.\u2013 Directed learning: recommended reading or viewing (CD-ROM, videos, websites). Study assign-\nments: problem-based learning, discussion of case histories and practical problems.\n\u2013 Distance-learning courses.\u2013 Preparing sessions.\n4.2. Learning in context\n\u2022 This involves: putting the family medicine registrar in a real situation in which self-directed learn-\ning can take place.\n\u2022 It is particularly suitable for: learning about the complexity of functions and decision-making as a\nprofessional.\n\u2022 Different models\n\u2013 Direct observation (the family medicine registrar sees what the tutor is doing).\u2013 Tutored interventions (the family medicine registrars carry out their interventions in the presence\nof the tutor).\n\u2013 Direct intervention, not supervised directly by the tutor (information is obtained in different ways\nfrom direct observation: audit of case histories, the patient\u2019s opinion, the opinion of other col-leagues in the team or from secondary care).\n\u2013 Video recordings made in the doctor\u2019s surgery (with the patient\u2019s consent) and subsequent analysis.\n4.3. Classes\n\u2022 These involve: teacher-centred transmission of information about a specific subject.\n\u2022 They are particularly suitable for: the transmission of complex information and the creation of a\nframe of reference.\n\u2022 Different models:\n\u2013 Traditional teacher-centred class.\u2013 Participative class.Preference should be given to participative classes wherever possible.\n4.4. Small group learning\n\u2022 This involves: making the most of the interaction between members of the group.\n\u2022 It is particularly suitable for: working on attitudes.|13 12\n4Training methodology in the Family\nand Community Medicine TrainingProgramme 00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 13\u2022 Different models:\n\u2013 Seminars\u2013 Role-playing \u2013 Working in context \u2013 Viewing videos \u2013 Improving quality\u2013 Research\u2013 Other classroom techniques: working in pairs, grid, Philips 6x6, etc.\n4.5. Workshops\n\u2022 These involve: skills learning in small groups.\n\u2022 They are particularly suitable for: acquiring skills and procedures (behaviours that must be under-\ntaken in a specific way).\n\u2022 Different models:\n\u2013 With real or simulated patients.\u2013 With dummies.\u2013 With computerised programmes (simulators).\u2013 With educational projects.Family and Community Medicine \nTraining Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 14The training contents of each of the areas which make up the programme are grouped into different\nsections with the following general characteristics:\n\u2022 All specify the objectives and interventions grouped according to the level of priority and responsi-\nbility and also include knowledge, skills and attitudes. \n\u2022 The activities required have been gathered into a practical series of essential training specifica-\ntions. These specifications serve both to inform tutors and registrars of the knowledge, skills andattitudes that are the focus of learning at each point in time, and also enable tutors to convey therequired approach and activities of the rotation in question more clearly to healthcare managersin the different training facilities. \n\u2022 Likewise, the teaching methodology, the place of learning (health centre, internship at one of the\ntraining unit services, external rotation), learning time, recommended assessment and reading areset out for each training area and as appropriate, for each section or subsection.\nAlthough the final objective of training family medicine registrars is the acquisition of competencies\nso that they can provide care for individual as a whole person living in their own context, for educa-tional purposes the programme has been structured into five areas of competence, described in dif-ferent sections of this programme to facilitate understanding:\n\u2022Section 8 of the programme refers to the training area for essential competencies divided into:\n\u2013 Healthcare communication. The clinical consultation. The doctor-patient relationship.\n\u2013 Clinical reasoning. Decision-making. The patient-centred clinical method.\n\u2013 Managing health care. Teamwork. Management and organisation of care. Information systems.\nQuality management. Civil and medico-legal responsibilities.\n\u2013 Bioethics.\n\u2022Section 9 of the programme refers to the training area for individual patient care competen-\ncies, divided into two large groups:\n\u2013 Addressing healthcare needs and problems: Risk factors and cardiovascular problems.

Those training units\nwhose catchment areas do not include any rural areas can become affiliated to rural health centres belonging toother training units and obtain specific accreditations for this task. \n(4)Learning in context in children\u2019s health care will take place principally in primary care.\n(5)Elective internships to facilitate the improvement of competencies or undertake complementary training, will take\nplace at the end of year three, before the family medicine registrars begin their internship at the health centre.If the tutor and family medicine registrar deem this unnecessary, the family medicine registrar will join the staffof the health centre.\n(6)During year four of training, family medicine registrars must be able to play an active role in all the activities at\nthe health centre and take charge of a family medicine surgery with full autonomy and without the aid of the tutor.The supervision of autonomous interventions carried out by family medicine registrars at the surgery will be ful-filled without this precluding their supervision through the continuous tutoring referred to earlier. If in doubt orwhen faced with complex situations, registrars may have recourse to their principal tutor, the support tutor or other family doctors at the health centre where they hold the surgery. It is recommended that autonomoushealthcare activity is undertaken progressively so that, on completion of year four, it will include a period of nofewer than two months.\nSUGGESTIONS FOR CLASSES AND WORKSHOPS\nFamily medicine registrars must receive complementary theoretical and practical tuition which con-\nsolidates self-directed learning and learning in context and will enable them to acquire the competen-cies of a family doctor.

These services, which will be provided atthe training unit facilities, will be compulsory and be supervised by the associates and tutors at thehealthcare centres where they are carried out, with the help of the coordinator from the training unit.\nFrom an educational point of view, the recommended number of duty periods should be no fewer than\nthree, nor greater than five a month, even in the case of accumulated duty periods resulting from holi-day leave.\nIn any case, the coordinator and tutors from the training unit will plan the duty periods and other\nactivities for the family medicine registrars, bearing in mind their dual function as trainee staff andworkers at the healthcare units and centres where they are undergoing training. In order to achievethis, there must be the necessary coordination between the tutors and managerial bodies at thesecentres and units.\nGiven the educational value of participation in the on-call service, duty periods should also be includ-\ned in the time spent making up for training sessions missed as a result of long periods of sick leave,negative assessments and other eventualities envisaged by the current legislation. The number ofduty periods to be recuperated should be as deemed necessary in each case by the Advisory Com-mission, seeking a balance between the particular situation of the registrar and the required objec-tives of the programme.|2120\n7On-call duties during \nthe training period\nPERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NUMBER OF ON-CALL HOURS \nDURING THE INTERNSHIP, DIVIDED INTO DIFFERENT AREAS\nH.C./Hospital Medico- Emerg.accident and Pediatrics Ginaecology Orthopaedics TotalP.H.*emergencysurgical services\nR-1 25% 75% 1OO%\nR-2 \n& R-325% 37.5% 12.5% 4.5% 12.5% 8% 100%\nR-4 75% 12.5% 12.5% 100%\nThis means that if there were 4 duty periods/month, they would be distributed as follows: \nR-1would involve 3 months of duty periods in H.C./P.H. and 9 more at hospital accident and emergency depart-\nments, or if they were distributed throughout the year, 1/month in H.C./P.H. and 3/months in hospital accidentand emergency departments.R-2 and R-3 would involve 9 months of duty periods in hospital accident and emergency departments, 6 months\nof duty periods in H.C./P.H., 3 months in orthopaedics, 3 months paediatrics, 1 month in gynaecology and 2months in medico-surgical departments.R-4would involve 1 duty period per month, either in hospital accident and emergency departments or emergency\nservices, and an additional three in H.C./P.H.*H.C.: Health centres; P.H.: Primary healthcare.\nThe distribution of the duty periods in the second and third year may be combined with the rotations\naccording to the speciality area during these two years.\nAt small hospitals, duty periods will be performed at the accident and emergency departments deal-\ning with multiple pathologies.00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 21Duty periods in primary health care and hospital accident and emergency departments will be distri-\nbuted over the course of the year, throughout the four years of the internship. Under no circums-tances should the duty periods in primary health care be replaced by duty periods in hospital acci-dent and emergency departments if the stipulated hours in the latter have already been completed.\nWhen the accredited health centres do not provide on-call services, or these prove to be inadequate,\nduty periods can be transferred to other centres. This will involve the specific accreditation of thesecentres for this task. Tutoring during duty periods must be guaranteed in each case. 00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 228.1. Healthcare communication. The clinical consultation. \nThe doctor-patient relationship\nCommunication between doctor and patient is essential to clinical practice. It is estimated that a doc-\ntor will perform 200,000 consultations during the course of their career and as a result it is worthdoing well. Effective communication is essential to providing high-quality health care: it improvespatient satisfaction and understanding, therapeutic compliance and outcomes of  health care. Seri-ous problems have nevertheless been observed in communication between doctors and patients.\nCommunication, together with medical knowledge, physical examination, and decision-making, are the\nessential components of clinical competence. These four elements are the true essence of good clin-ical practice and as such communicative skills should not be a mere complement of medical practice.Without good communication skills, all knowledge and intellectual efforts are easily wasted. Whetherin the home or at the surgery, the doctor\u2019s knowledge is all conveyed during the face-to-faceencounter with the patient and consequently how something is said is just as important as what issaid.\nCommunication techniques must be taught and learnt as they are not an immutable personal cha-\nracteristic. Moreover, they must be taught with the same rigour as physical examination techniques,because personal experience in itself is insufficient and can take the registrar along the wrong path.\nLastly, it is important to highlight the fact that specific methods are required to address successful-\nly the teaching-learning process of communication techniques. Basically a change in behaviour is ne-cessary and to achieve this the most suitable methods are known as \u201cexperiential\u201d and include obser-vation, feedback and trials of communication techniques. The outcome of training is the adoption ofthe necessary knowledge and attitudes.\nOBJECTIVES \nOn completion of their training, family medicine registrars will demonstrate their ability to:\n1. Establish, maintain and conclude an appropriate healthcare and therapeutic relationship.\n2. Identify and provide a profile of the health problem/s presented by the patient.3. Agree with the patient on the most appropriate action for each problem.4. Inform and educate according to the patient\u2019s needs.5. Use time and resources adequately.\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nThe level of responsibility for all interventions related to communication skills is primary. So\nimportant is this responsibility that family doctors can be seen as setting the standards for com-\nmunication skills for secondary care specialists.|2322\n8Educational contents in the training\narea for essential competencies00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 23TRAINING ACTIVITIES GROUPED BY PRIORITY\nKnowledge, attitudes and skills \nPRIORITY I\n> To relate appropriately to patients and/or their families > To facilitate the willingness of patients and/or their families to provide diagnostic information > To ascertain the nature and history of the patient\u2019s health problem/s > To delve for relevant information concerning the biological, psychological and social aspects of the\nhealth problems \n> To take note of the information obtained about the biological, psychological and social aspects of\nthe health problems \n> To generate and test multiple hypotheses throughout the consultation with the patient and/or their\nfamily\n> To ensure that the patient and/or their family understand the nature of their problem > To ensure that the patient and/or their family understand the process and the recommended diag-\nnostic studies \n> To ensure that the patient and/or their family understand the relevant therapeutic measures > To reach an agreement with the patient and/or their family about the problems/s, the diagnostic\nprocess and therapeutic measures \n> To facilitate the willingness of patients and/or their families to accept the treatment plan.

Clinical reasoning. Decision-making. \nThe patient-centred clinical method \nFamily doctors must perform a dual role: they must understand both their patients and their illness-\nes, and in a context whose very characteristics invite different reasons for consultation - includingtime factors, different likelihoods of disease, high accessibility, availability of continuity of care as wellas specific healthcare responsibilities. Clinical reasoning and decision-making, together with commu-nication skills and scientific and technical knowledge, are the essential elements of good clinical prac-tice. Just as with communication skills, these other skills are not merely complementary but essen-tial and at the core of practice. Without these skills, medical knowledge can easily be underused andeven damaging.\nClinical reasoning and decision-making techniques and the patient-centred clinical method must be\nlearnt and taught with the same rigour as physical examination techniques, because experience aloneis insufficient and may cause the registrar to make errors. Just as with the consultation, clinical rea-soning is not an intuitive process and involves a number of stages which need to be identified becauseeach one can give rise to mistakes.\nThis area is divided into 6 sections corresponding to the general objectives that have been defined;\neach one specifies the educational aims pertaining to knowledge, attitudes and skills, grouped accord-ing to learning priority, as well as methodological suggestions, recommended reading and assess-ment possibilities.\nOBJECTIVES\nOn completion of their training, family medicine registrars will demonstrate their ability to:\n1. Be aware of the fundamentals and characteristics of decision-making in primary care.\n2.Apply the principals of clinical reasoning and decision-making to the problems presented at the\nfamily doctor\u2019s surgery.\n3. Use diagnostic tests and their results in clinical practice.|27 2600 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 274. Make a prognosis of the disease.\n5.

This work includes commenting on,  studying and presenting cases,without forgetting individual study and case-presentation sessions. The recommended methods are: \nA) Self-directed learningLiterature review of variations in medical practice at the health centre and/or accident and emer-\ngency department, for any common reason for consultation.\nB) Learning in contextWorking with the tutor at the surgery.(cont.)00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 30C) Courses\nIntroduction to clinical reasoning that can be included in a family practice seminar to be held during\nthe initial period of the internship at the health centre (R1).\nD) Group work\n\u2022 Group work on the way doctors make decisions.\n\u2022 Role-play about clinical reasoning in all its phases.\u2022 Individual and group work analysing sequentially, and with real examples, the different stages of\nthe diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic process.\n\u2022 Work with \nvideo recordings of consultations linking the diagnostic process with the consulta-\ntion style and narrative support techniques.\n\u2022 Undertaking and presenting clinical sessions which take an integrated approach to the problem,\nstudying it from a patient-centred care focus and presenting the different stages of the diag-nostic and therapeutic process, in accordance with the Riegelman diagram.\n\u2022 Application of the proposed activities in different clinical practice guidelines to hypothetical\ncases, valuing their feasibility and proposing relevant adaptations.\nE) WorkshopsPractical workshop on clinical reasoning and decision-making (R4).\nTheoretical and practical training could be planned on three levels: introduction in year one, which\nwill continue during years two and three with evidence based medicine, clinical epidemiology and diag-\nnostic tests, culminating during year four with a practical workshop on clinical reasoning and deci-\nsion-making .\nTheoretical and practical training must be closely linked to clinical consultation training and clinical\nepidemiology. It is considered very important to approach these sections jointly, or at least in a coor-dinated way, using the same examples and cases, role-play and video recordings in both activities.\nRECOMMENDED PLACE OF LEARNING\nTheoretical learning and training in clinical reasoning must be done in classrooms suited to smallgroups, which have the right materials and equipment: flip chart, blackboard, back projector, videoprojector, portable video camera, video-cassette player and television set.\nThe supervision of clinical reasoning style and techniques must be carried out at the family medicine\nregistrar\u2019s workplace.\nRECOMMENDED LEARNING TIME\nIt is recommended that the learning of clinical reasoning techniques should begin at the start of theinternship and continue throughout training.\nSpecial priority is recommended during the training periods at the health centre.Theoretical and practical training will be tailored to each training unit. However, it is advisable to\nspend at least 30 hours on this aspect over the four-year training period.|31 3000 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 31RECOMMENDED ASSESSMENT \nSee the epigraph at the end of section 8. \nRECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY \n\u2022 McWhinney IR.

Healthcare Management\n\u2022 Clinical management\n\u2022 Teamwork\u2022 Management and organisation of activity\u2022 Information systems\u2022 Quality management\u2022 Civil and medico-legal responsibility\nThe four functions of family doctors are the provision of health care, teaching, research and mana-\nging health care. Good clinical and non-clinical (organisational) management will determine whether the competencies of the family doctor have the desired impact on the objectives of the health system:the effectiveness, efficiency, equity and viability of the system. Managing health care determines abasic element of microeconomic efficiency, which is the efficiency of each particular level, or in otherwords, the ability to solve problems at reasonable cost, with the scientific and technical expertise cor-responding to the level. \nFamily doctors manage a large proportion of the resources of the Spanish National Health System:\nthey are time managers, information managers and quality managers within a framework of civil andmedico-legal responsibility, but above all they are clinical managers who must make efficient decisionsbased on the best available evidence, on their own clinical experience and bearing in mind thepatient\u2019s expectations.\nThis section divides into six subsections the key elements of health care management of interest to\nthe family doctor: clinical management, teamwork,  management and organisation of activity, infor-mation systems, managing quality and civil and medical-legal responsibility. The relevant objectivesand activities are defined in each section.\nNOTE:\nThe levels of secondary responsibility included in this thematic area refer to the need for spe-\ncialised technical assistance (Quality Groups, Health care Technician, Quality Coordinator, etc.).\n8.3.1.

Bioethics\nIn order to provide quality family medicine, it is not sufficient for family doctors to \u00abdo their job\u00bb; they\nmust \u00abdo it well\u00bb, from a scientific and technical point of view (guarantee of quality, evidence basedmedicine) as well as an ethical one. This will favour the prudent practice of family medicine.\nFurthermore, the appearance of ethical conflicts in the everyday practice of family medicine is becom-\ning a more and more frequent occurrence: conflicts not only related to healthcare practice, but toother aspects of day-to-day professional life: teamwork, relationships with other professionals, rela-tionships with the pharmaceutical industry, preventive interventions, use of resources, etc. Familydoctors must be able to deal with such conflicts and following a process of deliberation, be it indivi-dual or following consultation with the available resources intended for this purpose (colleagues,healthcare ethics commissions, committees of the Medical Associations, etc.) must assess the pos-sible ways of resolving them and try to select the best one for each case. \nOBJECTIVES\nOn completion of their training family medicine registrars will demonstrate their ability to:\n1.

It must be borne in mind that thesepeople are immersed in a \nfamily and social context and it is important for this philosophy to pervade\nthe entire learning process in order to ensure that treatment is not just provided for diseases andhealth problems.\nThis teaching area is subdivided into two large groups, the first concerning the approach to health-\ncare needs and health problems (9.1) set out in subsections according to organ or system, and asecond group concerning the approach to at-risk population groups, (9.2) subdivided as appropriate:children, adolescents, women, etc.\nNevertheless two situations are worthy of particular mention as they are common to all groups:\u2022The patient with multiple pathologies: this type of patient is a very frequent service user whose\nmultiple pathologies require an integrated approach as well as specialist knowledge to deal withpotential complications and interactions. Furthermore, it is essential to consider the patient\u2019s fa-mily and psychosocial context (creating suitable social support networks), \u00ablook after the maincarer\u00bb and provide smooth communication during the entire care process.\n\u2022The patients with a rare disease: while it is true that the family doctor\u2019s job revolves around the\nmanagement of the most common pathologies, it is no less true that they should have sound know-ledge of rare since they are the point of referral for these patients. Ideally, the family doctor shouldbe able to manage the main complications, provide therapeutic management and know the crite-ria for referral to secondary or tertiary care. In these cases, the approach should once again bebiopsychosocial, they must be aware of self-help groups, provide genetic advice and know the tech-niques for approaching any emergent ethical dilemmas.\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nThe different sections and subsections in this area have common training objectives as they form\npart of the basic and general competencies of each clinical area. These objectives must be taken\ninto account in each clinical area. \nOBJECTIVES\nOn completion of their training, family medicine registrars will demonstrate their ability to:\n1. Take a detailed case history to understand the patient\u2019s clinical picture.\n2. Carry out a thorough and competent physical examination according to the clinical picture.3. Assess and choose the best diagnostic strategy.4. Interpret basic laboratory investigations.5. Interpret basic radiological and electrocardiographic studies, if necessary.6. Identify appropriate hygienic and dietary measures.7. Identify appropriate pharmacological measures.8. Assess side effects and pharmacological interactions.9. Identify the need for follow-up checks.\n10. Identify the need for referral to second/tertiary level specialists.11. Assess the need and appropriateness of preventive interventions designed to promote health in\nline with expert national and international recommendations. Assess the need for palliative care,if necessary.\n12.

The training unit will adapt and combine all these methods according to the particular charac-teristics of the place where registrars are undergoing training and their needs. This means that someof the internships recommended in the above table, particularly those involving the acquisition ofskills, may be complemented or replaced by other training methods if the training benefits from theseinternships are not sufficient. We recommend 100 hours of theory and practical classes distributedthroughout the four years of training, in order to acquire and improve clinical competencies in eachof the areas of individual health care, population groups and at-risk groups. \nC) ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY \nIn these areas, direct tutoring by the tutor or person in charge of the department will be the mostsuitable way of assessing the extent to which the aims have been acquired, although we recommendobjective and standardised instruments be included in this methodology. It is important to rememberthe extreme usefulness of other assessment methods such as the introduction/discussion of cases,video-recording techniques, clinical history audits, etc., adapted as appropriate to the individual reg-istrar and their field (see chapter on evaluation).\nD) RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY \nThe recommended bibliography is included in section 16 of this programme on sources of informa-tion.\n9.2.

We recommend 100 hours of theory and practicalclasses distributed throughout the four years of training, in order to acquire and improve clinical com-petencies in each of the areas of individual health care, population groups and at-risk groups. \nC) ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY \nIn these areas, direct tutoring by the tutor or person in charge of the department will be the mostsuitable way of assessing the extent to which the aims have been acquired, although we recommendobjective and standardised instruments be included in this methodology. It is important to rememberthe extreme usefulness of other assessment methods such as the introduction/discussion of cases,video-recording techniques, clinical history audits, etc., adapted as appropriate to the individual reg-istrar and their field (see chapter on assessment).\nD) RECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY \nThe recommended bibliography is included in appendix I and II about sources of information.

This phenomenon can be seen from atleast four different perspectives: \n1. The family is the main source of care when one of its members falls ill.\n2. Family characteristics can determine the relationship of its members to the health system.3. Family dysfunction can play an important role in the appearance and continuation of the disease.4. There are different patterns of family response to the appearance and development of diseases.\nIt is also common knowledge that the health of a community depends to a large extent on the biopsy-\nchosocial health of its family networks. Therefore, the family is not only an important variable in theprevention of disease and the promotion of health, but becomes essential in care, rehabilitation andrecovery. It is therefore appropriate to establish the essential concepts which will enable Family and Community Medicine registrars to gradually develop the foundations for their future work in fam-ily health care. This programme therefore reviews the theory and focuses family care on primary carepractice, specifying the different levels and models of intervention as general objectives, and differen-tiating between a family orientated approach (or anticipatory assessment), from a family systemsapproach to clinical practice, right up to the level of family therapy. \nBasically, we use the term \nfamily orientated approach  to refer to the attitude of the professional.\nFrom this perspective the individual symptom or demand is assessed by taking the individual\u2019s familycontext as a reference, regardless of whether or not the family is present during the consultation. Itis not a case of substituting care of the individual for care of the family; on the contrary, it is aboutimagining the patient within their family context and taking the latter as a reference for the health-care/illness problem being presented. A family orientated approach to practice rests on two funda-mental premises: the acceptance of the biopsychosocial model and the incorporation of a holistic per-spective. \nThe second model is somewhat more complex, and attains the fourth level of intervention, as it\nrequires specific training to detect and neutralise dysfunctions that may exist in the family circle. Wecall this process the \nfamily systems approach as we act on the family system using a specific thera-\npeutic intervention. By defending the family systems approach we accept that situations exist in whichinterventions across the entire family as a unit can offer advantages over the individual approach. Weconsider that the family consultation is the basic intervention tool for this type of approach.\nFinally, and as Priority III, we recommend psychotherapy [brief family therapy] that does not require\nthe symptoms to be defined as psychological in order for them to be treated. Its theoretical founda-tions also lie in the general theory of systems and communication theory, as well as radical construc-tivism.\nOBJECTIVES\nOn completion of their training, family medicine registrars will demonstrate their ability to:\n1. Consider care for patients in their family context.\n2. Determine the family structure and identify the developmental crises the family may undergo\nthroughout its life cycle.\n3. Detect psychosocial problems and provide early assessment for the family.4. Perform a systematic assessment and intervene in a planned way when family problems arise.5.

To complement this, we recommend further study through an active and partici-pative approach, in theoretical and practical sessions. The theoretical content should be taught throughbrief participative presentations and/or specially designed exercises. Family medicine registrars will workin small groups, to which they can bring their own experience, as well as discuss common problems andsuggest feasible and useful alternatives for each professional. The use of role-playing techniques and work-ing with video recordings, provide registrars with the opportunity to \u00abexperience\u00bb (try out, exercise) thebasic skills for a family systems approach under supervision and in \u00ablow-risk\u00bb conditions.\nThe activities can comprise the following:\u2022 Initial training course.\n\u2022 The creation of a series of genograms (one for each stage in the family life cycle), supervised by\nthe tutor and assessed by the training unit (TU) specialist. \n\u2022 The observation of consultations carried out by the tutor, with their subsequent explanation.\u2022 The introduction of some aspects of family health care in the presentation of clinical cases in the\ngroup of family medicine registrars/tutors.\n\u2022 The reading of the recommended basic bibliography, supervised by the tutor or the TU.

Family medicine registrars must be aware that good family doctors cannot just restrict them-selves to dealing with the questions raised by patients at the surgery; they must also deal with thehealthcare needs of the entire population under their care and learn that community interventions,as a health promotion strategy, are among their functions.\nTraining in community care includes a wide variety of knowledge and skills, which are also based on\nindividual care at the doctor\u2019s surgery. It is important that family medicine registrars see the linksbetween individual and community care and the bridges that need to be built between both, therebyavoiding them being viewed as independent and unconnected. From the doctor\u2019s surgery, registrarsmust assess the context of the patients within the community, both in the analysis of their problemsas well as in possible interventions. They must recognise the limits of their actions in the surgeryitself and know which community resources might be effective. Family doctors who tutor registrarsmust therefore become actively involved in community care training and avoid delegating it to profes-sionals who work specifically in this field. This does not preclude however specific collaborators frombringing their knowledge and skills to intervention and participation activities.\nIt is of fundamental importance that family doctors acquire a favourable attitude towards working in\npartnership with other community organisations and resources that empower citizens and help themshare and play a central role in health care and its promotion.\nOBJECTIVES\nOn completion of their training, family medicine registrars will demonstrate their ability to:\n1. Provide individual care at the surgery, while taking into account the social and community context\nof the patients, both in terms of the conditioning factors of the problems and possible interven-tions and as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of individual interventions on the health of thecommunity. \n2. Identify and prioritise the healthcare needs and problems of the community through involvement\nin it.\n3. Identify the resources available to the community, know about their practical uses and foster their\ndevelopment.\n4. Develop and prioritise community programmes and interventions with the involvement of the com-\nmunity.\n5. Develop (implement) community programmes and assess them with the community\u2019s participa-\ntion.\n6. Know the conceptual bases of the qualitative methodology and its application to the practice of\nprimary care.\n7.

qualita-tive methodology, methodology of the group learning process, community participation.\nWith regard to training in qualitative methodologies, such as interviews, group activities, community\nmeetings, we do not recommend untutored, self-directed learning activities and distance-learningcourses. This is because they impinge more on knowledge than attitudes, and as a result can leadto greater levels of theoretical and practical disassociation.\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nThe entire teaching methodology in the community health care area should particularly bear in\nmind the objective of promoting attitudes that will recognise the importance of empowerment\nand real and active prominence of the community and their organisations in promoting and look-\ning after their health, and the role of the family doctor as the facilitator of this process. During\nthe training process, particular care should be taken over the attitudes shown, at least as much\nas if not more than knowledge and skills.\nRECOMMENDED PLACES OF LEARNING \n\u2022 Health Centre to which the family medicine registrar is assigned.

Although established \u00abrotations\u00bb are not\nessential, it is important that registrars are given opportunities to attend specific activities. This\nwill require very good planning by the training units and the collaboration of all tutors. Some of\nthe time assigned to the health centre during year two of the internship could also be devoted\nto this type of training  and suitable centres chosen for this purpose. \nRECOMMENDED LEARNING TIME\n\u2022 During years one, two and three, theoretical and practical work through self-directed learning,group work, classes and workshops without an established rotations. At least 30 hours should begiven to theoretical and practical training through group work, classes and workshops.\n\u2022 Some of the time assigned to health centres in year two can be devoted to this type of training,\nchoosing centres which are more active in community work.\n\u2022 Practical training will mainly take place during year four, not through a dedicated period, but\nthrough learning in context and active participation in specific interventions throughout the year.This approach requires good organisational planning while making sure it is not hindered by othertraining activities.\n\u2022 The time devoted to practical training in this area during year four should range from an obligato-\nry minimum of 5% of overall training time to a maximum of 10%. In view of the fact that participa-tion in training activities in this area would normally not involve a full day\u2019s work (interviews, groupactivities, meetings with community groups, etc.) the time dedicated is calculated by activities tak-ing up half a working day, meaning that the total number of [half-day] training activities to be car-ried out throughout the year will range from an obligatory minimum of 22 activities (one every twomonths and 12 days fully dedicated to training) and a maximum of 44 activities (one every weekand 24 days fully dedicated to training).\nRECOMMENDED ASSESSMENT\n\u2022 Supervision of consultation given by the family medicine registrar, medical record and introduction\nof patient-centred clinical cases: to analyse the community context of the problems identified, thelimitations of interventions at the surgery and the possible use of resources available to the com-munity in each case. \n\u2022 Assessment of prepared documents: gathering and presentation of data and identification and pri-\noritisation of healthcare needs, community programmes that have been drawn up and proposalsfor alterations, appraisal of programmes, design and planning of interventions, etc. To give specialvalue to the participation of the community in the processes.\n\u2022 Supervision of written or verbal conclusions by the family medicine registrars following observations\nof specific interventions.\n\u2022 Supervision of interventions by the family medicine registrars: interviews, group education interven-\ntions, participation in meetings.\n\u2022 The assessment must include, as a priority, the attitude of the family medicine registrar which\nshould be favourable to the active community participation in the promotion of health and healthcare avoiding attitudes of \u00abpower\u00bb and authority over them.\nRECOMMENDED BIBLIOGRAPHY \n\u2022 Turabi\u00e1n JL, P\u00e9rez Franco B.

Education and training \nFamily and Community Medicine specialists face the daily challenge of keeping abreast of the ever-\ngrowing body of knowledge, skills and attitudes that shape their specialist area. In this respect healthservices, scientific societies and different professional groups run continuing medical education pro-\ngrammes whose basic mission is to provide family doctors with the necessary tools to maintain andimprove their competencies, both with regard to knowledge as well as skills and attitudes. The imple-mentation of these programmes must take into account the cognitive process (reasoning and deci-sion-making) rather than following the traditional compilation of data in the form of a tutor-centredtalk or classic text book. They will also include new aspects such as individualisation of training, fos-tering self-responsibility during training and a greater specificity of educational sources and subjects.As the need for family doctors to update their skills increases, the need and responsibility to adaptto new communication, information and management technologies also increases exponentially: tech-nologies which must be included in the continuing education activities of the primary healthcare team.\nThroughout the internship period, family medicine registrars must be made aware of the current and\nfuture need to undertake continuing medical education activities. They should take part in continuingmedical education at their health centre in order to internalise the need for it to form a part of theirprofessional lives, as an essential way of guaranteeing their patients appropriate health care.In short, throughout their training, family medicine registrars must internalise the fact that continu-ing training and the accreditation of professional competence is a guiding principle of the practice ofhealth care, described by article 12 of Law 44/2003 for the Regulation of Healthcare Professionsas \u00aba right and a duty\u00bb which must be required of the Health Institutions where they provide servic-es in the future.\n12.1.1. Continuing medical education\nIn continuing education, it is first important to define and know about educational needs, subsequent-ly planning suitable training activities to improve any deficits in competencies. There are a number ofprogrammes designed with this aim in mind, which will be useful to family doctors, with a broad spec-trum of contents, activities and methodologies. In theory, continuing medical education programmesfor family doctors must respond to the necessary updating and renewal of the skills acquired duringthe internship, and developments in their fields of competence throughout their professional lives.\nContinuing education, as stipulated in article 37 of Law 44/2003, mentioned previously, and article\n40 of Law 55/2003, which approved the Framework Statute for Statutory Health Service Person-nel, will be a fundamental tool for the acquisition of the levels of \u00abprofessional development\u00bb and \u00abpro-fessional career\u00bb which are regulated by both laws. \nIn this context, competence assessment procedures acquire specific importance, both for family med-\nicine registrars during training and on completion of their internship, and for practising family doctors,completed in the latter case with accredited continuing education activities. It is therefore importantfor family medicine registrars to familiarise themselves with the new teaching and assessment method-ologies and to include, for instance, activities with simulated and standardised patients.\n12.1.2. Updating knowledge through new technologies \nAs is the case with other professions, the computerisation of medical knowledge and the organisa-tion of health care must be one of the main features of training and continuing education activities inmedicine. Of all the medical specialities, family medicine needs to place particular emphasis on updat-ing to new technologies, due to its particular communication needs, information and managementwith regard to the community, its patients and the rest of the health system. In order to do this, ithas at its disposal a variety of media such as the publication in electronic format of many specialistjournals in the field, congresses organised by scientific societies, the development of multimediateaching tools (multimedia courses or expert systems for diagnosis), virtual congresses, specialistcourses, virtual patients, discussion forums and literature reviews.|103 102\n12\nEducational contents in the training\narea for competencies in education,training and research00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 103The internet is an essential tool where resources can be found free of charge for continuing medical\neducation appropriately geared to the general public or to a specific group of professionals.\nThere are many advantages to acquiring competencies in these new technologies for the continuing\nmedical education process itself, because these methods will be particularly useful, not just duringthe training period, but during the registrar\u2019s future professional life, enabling them to create theirown learning environments consisting of virtual tuition, on-line assessment, etc. \nThe popularity of the internet has given patients greater access to medical information. The traditio-\nnal inequality in scientific and medical information between doctor and patient is beginning to fade, with the added problem that patients can access more information which is also incorrect or unneces-sary. All family doctors must have access to the medical information used by their patients and haveat their disposal the internet resources provided by universities, the pharmaceutical industry andcommunication companies which provide them with free access to updated information, search toolsto find abstracts of articles [available on Medline or not), consultation with experts, etc. Doctors caninclude routine screenings or checks in these information systems to remind them of the most advis-able steps to take. It is likely that the technologies will become more and more simple and thereforeeasier to use although this in turn, will involve new possibilities and technologies which doctors willhave to keep abreast of.\nThe implementation of the Family and Community Medicine Programme through the training units,\nmust guarantee that registrars are familiar enough with all the communication technologies and theinformation to use them in their future careers and to incorporate new technologies when theyappear. \nOBJECTIVES\nOn completion of their training, family medicine registrars will: \n1. Know about systems for determining training deficits and opportunities for improving competen-\ncies.\n2. Know about and manage the usual sources of professional training and information.3. Be able to draw up an individualised training plan, geared to the improvement of competencies.4.

Research methodology \nQuality research must be encouraged as a fundamental tool to generate knowledge and contribute\nto the progress of the health system, fostering the transferral of research outcomes to clinical prac-tice in order to boost its effectiveness. Research is essential at all healthcare levels and for all health-care professionals, because it is a way of achieving innovations that make it possible to provide effi-cient and better quality care. \nPrimary care is the first point of contact provided by the health service to individuals and the popula-\ntion in a continuing, integral and integrated way, regardless of age, gender, state of health or illness.However there is a particularly striking difference between the high levels of care provided at primarylevel and its scant presence in current research.\nAmong the reasons which dictate the need for a change in this respect, we find: \u2022 The existence of uncertainty in the professional practice of family doctors. Uncertainties in their\ndaily work are almost infinite and as a result there are many questions that require answers.\n\u2022 Primary care deals with diseases at an earlier stage than other healthcare areas. Another differen-\ntiating factor is that while other areas can only carry out research into disease, mortality and hightechnology, primary care is the only level that can research into health as well. Nevertheless theresults of research undertaken in other areas are often applied to primary care; areas treating\u00abideal\u00bb patients at specific stages of their illness and from selected age groups which do not matchthe patterns of the real population treated by family doctors at their surgeries. It is therefore impor-tant that the clinical practice of the family doctor should raise questions and seek the best answersfor patients at this healthcare level. In this respect the area in which research is conducted can sig-nificantly shape the results and the way these are transferred to practice- This in turn affects thetrue estimate of the prevalence of the disease, the frequency of the conditions presented bypatients, the predictive value of the tests used and the expected response to treatment. \n\u2022 There is an on-going relationship with patients in primary care which provides an opportunity to\nobserve them over uninterrupted periods of time and in their family, working and social environ-ments.\n\u2022 The sector retains an enquiring spirit: research initiatives are relatively common, as is shown in\nthe major contributions to primary care congresses and scientific meetings or journals in the field.Many of these projects are descriptive, precise studies which with the right support, could lead toquality lines of research.\nLack of knowledge about the factors that condition the health of our fellow citizens, the natural his-\ntory of the disease, the health services or the type of care we provide, costs society dear, both ineconomic terms and in physical, mental and social well-being. The continuing accumulation of fact-based knowledge is the cornerstone of progress and primary care cannot be an exception to the rule.\nOBJECTIVES\nOn completion of their training, family medicine registrars will:\n1. Know about the main sources of scientific documentation and be able to manage it skilfully.\n2. Be able to make a critical reading of manuscripts on the following issues: aetiology, diagnostic tri-\nals, therapeutics, prognosis, efficiency.\n3. Know the basic principles of designing research projects and have the skills to apply them to the\ndesign of a project relevant to their clinical practice.\n4. Know the ethical principles of biomedical research and include them both in the design of projects\nas well as in the way in which findings are incorporated into clinical practice. \n5.

It is recommended that each of the principal tutors have assigned to thema maximum of two family medicine registrars at the same time. The tutor must be a specialist inFamily and Community Medicine, without this precluding the transitory regime referred to in sec-tion 13.1.3 of this programme.\n\u2022The support tutor. In addition to the principal tutor, family medicine registrars will also have sup-\nport tutors specialising in Family and Community Medicine. Principal tutors can be the supporttutors for other family medicine registrars. \n\u2022The hospital tutor is responsible for coordinating and supervising the training of family medicine\nregistrars during periods of in-hospital training. The number of hospital tutors assigned will dependon the number of family medicine registrars on rotation in the hospital. The hospital tutors will haveprofessional experience in accordance with the function they are expected to perform, and if theyare Family and Community Medicine specialists this will be particularly valued.\n\u2022Training associates are specialists and professionals from the different sections of the training\nunit where the family medicine registrars are working on a rotation basis. Although they are notthe tutors of the  registrars studying Family and Community Medicine, they contribute to the teach-ing of this programme and assume the supervision and monitoring of the interventions carried outduring these rotations. They are not therefore required to be Family and Community Medicine spe-cialists.\n\u2022Public health specialists are the healthcare professionals who, although not tutors, contribute to\nthe theoretical and practical training and research envisaged in the programme undertaken at thetraining unit. They are specialists in Family and Community Medicine, preventive medicine and pu-blic health, and can also be professionals with accredited training in teaching and researchmethodology and the theoretical and practical blocks of the Family and Community Medicine train-ing programme.\n\u2022The training unit coordinator is responsible for the management, planning and organisation of the\ntraining unit and also carries out assessments/monitoring, training and research, and the man-agement and coordination of the training interventions of the primary care tutors. The training unitcoordinator must be a specialist in Family and Community Medicine.\n\u2022The Training Unit Advisory Commission is the collegial body which organises education, supervis-\nes its practical application and checks to ensure the training unit fulfils the objectives of the train-ing programme.\n\u2022Other individuals and organisations regulated by the Autonomous Communities of Spain accord-\ning to the characteristics and structure of the training units within their jurisdiction.\n13.1. Tutors and their relationship with the registrar \nand management \nTutors are actively working, medical professionals, who are recognised as having a suitable level of\ntraining and working environment which qualify them to impart the knowledge, skills and attitudes|111 110\n13\nResponsibility, supervision and\nevaluation of the educationprogramme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 111inherent in specialised medical training. They assume responsibility for playing an active role in the\nteaching and learning process of specialist doctors in training, within an institutionalised context.\nThe tutor is a unique figure in the family medicine registrar\u2019s training process. This means that the\ndistinctions at the beginning of this section (principal tutor, support tutor, hospital tutor) are madeaccording to how closely the tutor is associated with the family medicine registrar in individual terms,without there being any hierarchy among any of these figures.\nThe tutor is a key figure in training family medicine registrars, particularly in the context of this pro-\ngramme which has flexibility as one of its defining characteristics. This flexibility involves the individu-alisation and personalisation of the training programme by adapting the contents, training times andmethods to the needs of each family medicine registrar. \nTutors must meet two basic criteria:\u2022 Be a good family doctor: their competencies and experience must fit in with those described in\nthis programme.\n\u2022 Be a good trainer, as the quality of the training obtained by the family medicine registrar will\ndepend on the tutor\u2019s attitude to training, their preparedness, their ability to convey knowledge andthe way they handle interpersonal relationships.\nThe tutor must plan, stimulate, direct, monitor and assess the family medicine registrar\u2019s learning\nprocess, by performing the functions stipulated in paragraph 7.3 s\u00e9ptimo. 3 of the Order of 22ndJune 1995, and should therefore:\n\u2022\nGive guidance to family medicine registrars throughout the entire training period. To do this, the\ntutor must help them identify their learning needs and the objectives of each rotation, both at the hospital and the health centre; establish their individual training plan with them and, if neces-sary, the elective internships they have to take part in, informing them about other activities ofinterest to their training.\n\u2022\nSupervise the family medicine registrar\u2019s training. With this aim in mind, the tutor must:\n\u2013 Use the training specifications included in this programme as a basic tool, complemented by the\ninformation provided by the hospital tutor and the other people responsible for supervising the training programme.\n\u2013 Establish a calendar of regular meetings or interviews with the family medicine registrar they are\ntutoring, to jointly analyse how training is progressing and to try and rectify any weak points.\n\u2022\nBe the family medicine registrar\u2019s key advocate and as such provide support and ensure they are kept\ninformed. The tutor is the key element in resolving conflicts and in protecting the registrar\u2019s rights.\n\u2022Foster self-directed learning and the progressive acquisition of responsibility by the registrar.\n\u2022Foster the  registrar\u2019s training and research skills.\n\u2022Be the main person responsible for training assessment or the continuous assessment of the fam-\nily medicine registrar, playing an active part in the yearly/qualitative assessment through theassessment commissions.\n\u2022 Take part in \ndrawing up the annual report about the teaching activities carried out by the family\nmedicine registrars at the health centre.\n13.1.1. The relationship between tutor and family medicine registrar\nThe family medicine registrar\u2019s learning process is based on a person-centred collaborative model.This is not the typical teacher-student relationship, nor is it one of friendship or comradeship. Rather,it is characterised by being an interpersonal, individualised relationship tailored to the needs of eachregistrar. It must therefore be undertaken in an atmosphere that will enable the training specialist toparticipate in defining objectives and in the progressive exchange of roles as the registrar progress-es in his or her training.Family and Community Medicine \nTraining Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 112Every tutor has an individual tutoring style, but they should all be able to:\n\u2022 Communicate (empathy).\u2022 Stimulate (give incentive, inject impetus and enthusiasm).\u2022 Transmit information at the appropriate time.\u2022 Explore the registrar\u2019s expectations and attitudes.\u2022 Foster dialogue.\n13.1.2. The relationship between tutor and manager \nThe importance of the tutor in the adequate training of family medicine registrars determines whether\nthe healthcare administrations encourage the following:\n\u2022 Maintenance and improvement of the tutor\u2019s competencies in clinical practice and training method-\nology, providing them with access to continuing education in: \u2013 Issues related to the knowledge and learning of educational methods.\u2013 Communication, monitoring and quality improvement techniques.\u2013 Motivation, supervision and assessment techniques.\u2013 Ethical values and aspects of the profession.\u2013 Issues related to the contents of the training programme.\n\u2022 Suitable care and teaching conditions:\n\u2013 Controlled workload, based on the recommendation that doctors should not see more than 30\npatients/day, or devote more than five hours to consultations.\n\u2013 Specific time for training.\u2013 Support from the training structure.\n\u2022 Interventions geared to maintaining motivation: those tutors who guarantee quality training must\nbe recognised by management either through their professional career or other economic, work-related or training incentives to compensate for the efforts this duty involves.\n\u2022 Application of criteria together with the qualifications required, will guarantee the suitability of the\ntutors appointed.\n13.1.3. Accreditation and reaccreditation of tutors \nThe Advisory Commissions will envisage, within the framework of the Overall Assessment Plan of thetraining unit mentioned in section 14.1., accreditation and reaccreditation procedures of tutors witha view to defining their basic experience and maintaining their competencies for the purpose. To thisend the following criteria will be taken into account:\n\u2013 Development of a training project (assessment, tutoring methodology, etc.) which will be assessed\nby the Advisory Commission.\n\u2013 Work experience as a family doctor lasting a minimum of one year at the corresponding health centre.\u2013 Participating in continuing education activities, particularly those related to training skills and the\ncontents of the education programme.\n\u2013 Undertaking research and participating in activities geared to improving quality.\nNOTE:\nThose people who graduated in Medicine before 1st January 1995 can be tutors, even though\nthey are not specialists, pending the approval of their degree in Family and Community Medicine,\nregulated by Royal Decree 1753 of 31st July 1998, provided that they can give proof of profes-\nsional experience described in paragraph 2.2 of the official programme of the speciality, contin-\nuous practice of the profession and training experience in the field of primary health care.|113 11200 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 11313.2. The hospital tutor \nTutors will be appointed by the hospital manager/director together with other doctors from the insti-\ntution who have the professional experience suited to the functions the tutor has to perform. Familyand Community Medicine specialists this will be particularly valued.\nFrom a training point of view, and within the framework of the Ministerial Order of 22nd June 1995,\nhospital tutors must: \n\u2022 Be members of the Advisory Commission of the Family and Community Medicine training unit.\n\u2022 Be members of the Assessment Committee of family medicine registrars according to the terms\nenvisaged by current legislation.\n\u2022 Coordinate and supervise every aspect of the education programme at the hospital, together with\nthe training unit coordinator: duty periods, rotations, etc.\n\u2022 Advise the Family and Community Medicine training unit on all issues related to the in-hospital train-\ning of family medicine registrars.\n\u2022 Provide monitoring and technical support within the hospital training department:\n\u2013 Detect and analyse shortcomings in the education of  specialists in Family and Community Med-\nicine in the hospital.\n\u2013 Propose improvement interventions for the organisation of in-hospital training.\u2013 Participate in drawing up on-call rotas for family medicine registrars within the hospital.\u2013 Participate in drawing up individual rotation plans for each family medicine registrar.\u2013 Provide hospital trainers with information and education about the objectives of the Family and\nCommunity Medicine Programme.\n13.3. The training associate and public health specialist in \nthe Family and Community Medicine Programme\n13.3.1. The training associate \nThe role of the training associate is specified in article 104 of the General Healthcare Law 14/1986\nand article 22 of Law 45/2003 for the Regulation of Healthcare Professions which envisages theavailability of all the structures of the health system to be used in the specialised, continuous under-graduate training of professionals.\nIn this context, training associates are specialists and professionals who are not tutors of family medi-\ncine registrars, but trainers in different sections of the training unit. They are responsible for trainingfamily medicine registrars during their education periods in these sections. Professionals working in pri-mary care who are not family doctors [paediatricians, nurses, physiotherapists, midwives, etc.], but con-tribute to the training of family medicine registrars will have the support of the training associates.\nFrom a training point of view, training associates must:\u2022 Give guidance to family medicine registrars throughout the entire training period in their unit or\nservice.\n\u2022 Supervise the family medicine registrar\u2019s training using the training specifications included in this\nprogramme as a basic tool, completed with the information provided by the hospital tutor and prin-cipal tutor.\n\u2022 Be the family medicine registrar\u2019s key advocate during the training period and consequently, pro-\nvide support and ensure they are kept informed.\n\u2022 Foster self-directed learning and the progressive acquisition of responsibility by the family medicine\nregistrar.Family and Community Medicine \nTraining Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 114\u2022 Foster the family medicine registrar\u2019s training and research skills . \n\u2022 Be the main person responsible for training assessment or the continuous assessment of the fam-\nily medicine registrar during the training period.\n13.3.2. The public health specialist\nAll the training units for the correct implementation of the programme will have public health specialistson their staff. The number of specialists and the amount of time they devote to the unit will depend onthe number of family medicine registrars undergoing training and the particular characteristics of thetraining unit (geographical dispersal, participating centres, programmed activities, etc).\nPublic health specialists are the healthcare professionals who are not tutors of  family medicine re-\ngistrars, but who carry out the tasks entrusted to them by the training unit coordinator, which aredesigned to facilitate the implementation of the theoretical and practical programme of the speciali-ty. They take part in the training and research activities at the training unit and health centre gearedto improve the education of residents as well as tutors. \nFrom a training point of view, and within the framework of the functions assigned to public health\ntechnicians in the Ministerial Order of 22nd June 1995, these professionals must:\n\u2022 Be members of the Advisory Commission, and teach the courses and modules that are part of the\nprogramme, and collaborate with the coordinator in planning and adapting it to the characteris-tics of the corresponding training unit.\n\u2022 Support the tutors, detecting their training requirements and providing opportunities to facilitate\ntheir education.\n\u2022 Provide monitoring and technical support at the training health centres, detecting and analysing\nthe deficiencies in the education they provide.\n\u2022 Put together quality management programmes at the corresponding training unit.\u2022 Stimulate, support and create solid lines of research at the training unit, tailoring them to the\nneeds of each unit and the general health plans.\n\u2022 Collaborate with the training unit in other educational activities (undergraduate, medical and nurs-\ning specialities, etc.) carried out at the training unit.\n13.4. The training unit coordinator \nEach Family and Community Medicine training unit will have a training unit coordinator, with a degreein Family and Community Medicine, appointed according to the terms envisaged in the applicable le-gislation in guideline 6.1 of Royal Decree 1558 of 28th June 1986, which establishes the generalguidelines for the agreement regime between Universities and Health Institutions. This will be doneafter hearing the opinion of the Advisory Commission and in the case of training units with health cen-tres and university hospitals, and after hearing the Mixed Commission.\nThe appointment of a training unit coordinator, as envisaged in paragraph 6 of the Ministerial Order\nof 22nd June 1995, must fall to a specialist with accredited experience in health care, teaching andresearch, for the purpose of which the appointment and if the case arises, the dismissal of the coor-dinator, must take into account the following points: \n\u2022 Clinical experience, backed up by years of professional experience as a family doctor.\n\u2022 Training in the speciality.\u2022 Skills in training methodologies.\u2022 Training and tutoring experience with family medicine registrars.|115 11400 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 115\u2022 Skills in research methodology.\n\u2022 Doctorate and research activities carried out.\u2022 Membership of commissions or work groups in the Health Department, administrations of the\nAutonomous Community or State.\n\u2022 Skills and experience in negotiation, mediation and communication between the different agents\ntaking part in the training programme.\n\u2022 Experience and training in resource planning, organisation and management.\nTime dedicated to training by the coordinator \nIn accordance with the additional first regulation of the Ministerial Order of 22nd June 1995, con-\ncerning the \u00abtime dedicated by doctors to specialised training activities\u00bb, the managerial bodies ofhealth centres will have to adopt, after hearing the opinion of the Advisory Commission, the appro-priate measures so that the doctors who occupy the post of training unit coordinator can performtheir duties efficiently and effectively. \nIt is recommended that the coordinator work in an area of health care that fits in with the charac-\nteristics of the unit. \nFrom a training point of view and within the scope of their duties as administrators and managers of\nthe material resources of each unit assigned to them by the Ministerial Order of 22nd June 1995,the coordinators must:\n\u2022 Chair the Advisory Commission, be the head of studies of the training unit and direct the training\nactivities of the tutors.\n\u2022 As president of the Advisory Commission the coordinator will perform the duties assigned by arti-\ncle 23 of Law 30/1992 governing the Legal Regime of Public Administrations and the CommonAdministrative Procedure, resolving with their vote any stalemate in the adoption of agreements.\n\u2022 Submit the planning and organisation of the education programme, as well as the yearly calendar\nof rotations, duty periods, courses, seminars and workshops, to the Advisory Commission forapproval, and supervise its practical application.\n\u2022 Chair the annual Assessment Committees, resolving any stalemate that arises, while promoting,\nboosting and supervising compliance with the Overall Assessment Plan of the training unit.\n\u2022 Participate as a member in the Training Commissions of the hospitals that are part of the train-\ning unit, supervising and coordinating the practical application of rotations in each of them.\n\u2022 Act as representative of the unit, and trainer-advocate with the management bodies of the primary\ncare centres and hospitals which are part of the unit, coordinating the activities that  registrarsmust undertake in both, while directing and supervising the practical application of these activities.\n\u2022 Promote, foster and define lines of research and intervention in accordance with the Healthcare\nPlan of the Autonomous Community, the needs of the locality and those detected at the regularmeetings of tutors with family medicine registrars.\n\u2022 Administer the human and material resources assigned to the training unit, while supervising its\norganisational structure and managing the allotted budget and drawing up the yearly plan ofrequirements, according to the protocols of the different management departments.\n\u2022 Propose to the Advisory Commission and through the commission, to the bodies responsible in\neach Autonomous Community, the training places available during the year in the coordinator\u2019straining unit.\n\u2022 Handle the minutes of the annual evaluation and guarantee they are set down correctly and sent\nin time and in the correct form to the Ministry of Health and Consumption.\n\u2022 Carry out any other duty that may be assigned to them by the applicable regulations.Family and Community Medicine \nTraining Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 11613.5.

Theprimary aim is to guarantee quality and similar training for all family medicine registrars, irrespectiveof the training unit where the training programme is held.\nNotwithstanding the above, and without precluding the external assessments that may be carried out\nthrough the audits agreed by the bodies with competencies in evaluating the running and quality ofeach training unit, an internal Overall Assessment Plan will be carried out in each training unit, in asystematic and structured way agreed on by consensus. The plan will be approved by the AdvisoryCommission and guarantee appropriate [continuous and yearly] assessment of the family medicineregistrars assigned to the unit and the periodic assessment of the training structure of the unit.\n14.1. The Overall Assessment Plan of the Training unit \nThe Overall Assessment Plan of the training unit will be drawn up within the Advisory Commission toguarantee the coordinated and correct implementation of the evaluation activities carried out in eachunit.\nCriteria for drawing up the Overall Assessment Plan: Without overly influencing the content of each\nindividual Overall Assessment Plan, the plan should include: \n\u2022 Strategic guidelines.\n\u2022 Specific tools within the training unit to assess the family medicine registrar: self-assessment,\nrotation reports, analysis of registers, analysis of clinical cases, demonstrations of diagnostic andtherapeutic techniques, OSCE etc.\n\u2022 Common protocols for the assessment of the different rotations and internships to be carried out\nby family medicine registrars from the unit, taking as reference the training specifications in sec-tions 8, 9, 10,11 and 12 of this programme.\n\u2022 Specific tools within the training unit to assess the training structure for different aspects speci-\nfied in section 14.3.\n\u2022 Protocols for the assessment of the training structure.\u2022 Assessment procedures for the accreditation and reaccreditation of tutors. \u2022 Planning of periodic meetings to monitor effectively the assessments done at the training unit.\u2022 Measures to guarantee the objectivity and confidentiality of the training process.\u2022 Improvement measures adopted as a result of outcomes from the Overall Assessment Plan. \n14.2.

Continuous/Training assessment \nThis type of assessment, which is referred to in paragraph 8 of the Ministerial Order of 22nd June\n1995, BOE [Official State Bulletin] of 30th June, is the most important insofar as it assesses the reg-istrar\u2019s learning process as a result of continuous direct or indirect supervision by the tutor, and bythe tutors or people in charge of the units in the rotation scheme. \nTraining assessment will be based on monitoring the training aims of the programme and ensuring\nthey are fulfilled, tailoring it to each family medicine registrar and proposing specific interventions forthose areas of training and skills which reveal shortcomings.|119 118\n14\nAssessment00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 119Generally speaking, the registrar\u2019s principal tutor will be mainly responsible for carrying out and mon-\nitoring this assessment. The tutor will have to implement the personalised plan within the frameworkof the Overall Assessment Plan of the training unit.\nThe most important tools for training assessment and continuous assessment, besides those stipu-\nlated in paragraph 8 of the previously mentioned Ministerial Order of 22nd June, are:\n\u2022\nPeriodic interviews between tutor and family medicine registrar \nThe aim of the interviews is to monitor the fulfilment of the training aims.The conceptual elements of these interviews are:\n\u2013 Training centred on the family medicine registrar: self-assessment of the needs detected with\nregard to the teaching aims.\n\u2013 Identifying specific educational objectives and planning how to learn them.\u2013 The tutor guides and motivates the registrar towards self-directed learning.\u2013 The tutor must be the \u00abexample to be followed\u00bb.\nThese interviews will be undertaken according to the feedback model: systematic meetings, previous-\nly agreed meetings to review specific themes that have also been agreed on. Ideally, these meetingswill be undertaken halfway through each specific training period, to assess the benefits acquired dur-ing training and any shortcomings, thereby favouring the possibility of establishing plans to make upfor the shortcomings observed.\nA minimum of four interviews of this type will be held every academic year.\u2022\nAssessment meetings between the principal  tutor and the other people in charge of the training\nprogramme: coordinator, public health specialist, hospital tutor\u2026who will analyse the correspon-\nding rotation reports.\n\u2022Specific tools: those envisaged in the Overall Assessment Plan of the training unit in question.\n14.2.2. Yearly qualitative/summary assessment \nThe yearly assessment referred to in paragraph 10 of the Ministerial Order of 22nd June 1995, will\nbe carried out by the evaluation committees. The composition of the committees will be as specifiedin paragraph 9.2 and 9.4 of this order. \nThe yearly assessment of the committees can be positive (Excellent, Outstanding or Satisfactory) or\nnegative (in the cases envisaged in paragraph 4 of the previously mentioned order).\nThe assessment committees, following the guidelines set out in the Overall Assessment Plan of each\ntraining unit, will tailor the available assessment tools to obtaining the greatest objectivity in the year-ly summary assessment, insofar as this is possible. The instruments used to carry out this qualita-tive evaluation will consist of those used in continuous/training assessment. \n14.2.3.

Internet portals and search tools for primary care\nPortals\nA portal is a website which serves as a gateway to the Internet. Due to the initial increase in gene-\nral information portals, healthcare professionals have begun to develop specialised portals of theirown. Healthcare portals can be geared to professionals or the general public. The next few pages lista series of primary care portals for professionals. These websites comprise lists of links which havebeen placed in some kind of order, or pages with their own contents and services, as well as a wholehost of other content.\nFisterra\nhttp://www.fisterra.com\nSpanish\nThis is undoubtedly one of the most useful and comprehensive websites for family doctors. Structured\nlike a portal, it has also become a source of exclusive documents with a high added value content.The most important section of links, \u00abRecursos en la red\u00bb [Net resources], features a selection oflinks and places special emphasis on those devoted to medical literature and bibliographical search-es.\nThe contents section features a page on reference material entitled \u00abMaterial para la consulta\u00bb with\nlinks and documents containing all the information required during day-to-day consultation. Thisranges from diets to advice and information for patients. It includes a developed application usingAccess which makes it possible to perform the most common mathematical calculations (risk fac-tors, dosage, diagnostic scales, etc.) in primary care consultation. Another useful section \u00abGu\u00edas cl\u00edni-cas\u00bb [Clinical guidelines] contains a wide variety of topics about the most prevalent health problemsin primary care, written by family doctors and other specialists. These guidelines are midway betweena brief review and an intervention protocol. Although they do not follow the layout of a traditional clin-ical practice guideline and their quality is variable, they provide a very interesting and useful referenceand continuing education tool.\nFinally, we highlight the section entitled \u00abEl lado humano de la Medicina\u00bb [the human side of medi-\ncine], with pertinent comments and essays on the role of medicine in other arts such as literatureand film.\nRafabravo website\nhttp://www.infodoctor.org/rafabravo/\nSpanish\nSet up by Dr. Rafael Bravo Toledo, a doctor at the \u00abSector III\u00bb health centre in district 10 of\nMadrid.\nThis website should be visited periodically by family doctors. Here they can find:\u2022 Documents and other high-quality resources on evidence based medicine.\n\u2022 Bibliographical alert on important articles for family doctors.\u2022 Link to websites of interest to family doctors.\nAtheneum. Club Virtual de Atenci\u00f3n Primaria\nhttp://www.atheneum.doyma.es\nSpanishPortal set up by the publishers Doyma which includes, under the heading \u00abColecciones\u00bb [Collections]a series of documents, clinical or otherwise, classified by thematic areas and published in journalsfrom their publishing group. This material and additional articles from all their magazines related toprimary care, can also be accessed from a powerful search engine called ApLine.|131 13000 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 131The portal also includes sections on clinical cases, a search engine and a selection of external links,\nnews, picture gallery and self-assessment test.\nFamily Practice\nhttp://www.familypractice.com/intro.htm\nEnglish\nSet up by The American Board of Family Practice, one of the family medicine associations in the Unit-\ned States, this is a clearly designed, well-set out portal, divided into four sections or centres: onedevoted to continuing education, a clinical section featuring useful resources such as a collection ofguides and algorithms for making clinical decisions, a news centre or section providing access to thecomplete text of the JABFP.\nMedical directories and search engines\nPrimary Care Guidelineshttp://medicine.ucsf.edu/resources/guidelines/index.html\nEnglish\nWebsite hosted by the University of California and maintained by one of the members of the univer-\nsity\u2019s Department of Medicine. It is an index or directory featuring an extensive list of links to clinicalpractice guides on the Internet, classified by categories based on equipment and diseases, listed inalphabetical order and in accordance with the institutions that produce them. It also includes an inter-nal search engine which makes it possible to rapidly locate guides on subjects of interest to us, justby keying in the right terminology. An additional way of indexing these resources is the classificationaccording to the most frequently encountered clusters at family medicine practices in the UnitedStates.\nThe focus of the selection of resources in this directory is based on the criteria of evidence based\nmedicine and it reviews them thoroughly. \nThe resources include links to clinical reviews, consensus-based lectures and other types of docu-\nments which do not fit within the concept of clinical practice guidelines in the strict sense, eventhough they are of unquestionable interest. Together with the guide directory, the site also includesother Internet links and brief summaries of the basic concepts of primary care. In view of the largeamount of information contained on the site, performing a search can often be a little complex, butyou overcome this problem as you get used to using the site. In short, this is an excellent websitefor the rapid location of general sources of information of the practice of family medicine, noted forthe painstaking selection of information and the certainty of only finding contrasted information. It isundoubtedly an excellent gateway to medical information on the Internet, from a family doctor\u2019s view-point.\nMedical Student\nhttp://www.medicalstudent.com/\nEnglish\nDigital library of web addresses, classified by category, designed to provide links to the main electron-\nic resources on the Internet and geared to medical students. It has an important section on medicalbooks.\nMedWeb\nhttp://www.medweb.emory.edu/MedWeb/default.htm\nEnglish\n\u00cdndex of medical resources structured as a traditional directory, which makes it possible to locate\naddresses contrasted with and selected from the main resources about all specialist areas of medi-cine.Family and Community Medicine \nTraining Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 132Primary Care Internet Guide\nhttp://www.uib.no/isf/guide/guide.htm\nEnglish\nDespite the fact that it is not updated very often, this is a useful list of primary care resources, The\nsite includes a noteworthy section that gathers addresses from distribution lists and international sci-entific societies (http://www.uib.no/isf/guide/family.htm).\nNational Guidelines Clearinghouse\nhttp://www.guidelines.gov/index.asp\nEnglish\nClinical practice guidelines can be considered as containing summaries of much of the relevant liter-\nature and are written as a series of brief and clear statements about the most interesting aspectsof clinical practice. The Internet has made it possible to access the complete texts of many of theseguides which were hitherto unavailable. As a rule, to view the texts, all you have to do is visit the web-site of the institutions that sponsor them. \nNevertheless, the widespread proliferation of these guidelines often makes them hard to find, and\nthe assessment of their quality even harder. This makes resources such as the National GuidelineClearinghouse particularly welcome. It is a database for evidence-based clinical practice guidelinesand related documents produced by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, in associationwith the American Medical Association and the American Association of Health Plans.It features a collection of summaries of guidelines ordered by the key words taken from the MEDLINEMeSH vocabulary or the body that has produced them. Every summary has a link to the completetext of the guideline, whenever it can be accessed via the Internet. As well as the list of guidelines,it contains articles, bibliographies and documents about topics related to the guidelines and a sec-tion on new publications and innovations.\nTripdatabase\nhttp://www.tripdatabase.com/index.cfm\nEnglish\nThis is a metasearch engine for finding medical websites containing important documents for med-\nical practice, in accordance with the pattern of evidence based medicine. It does not list many sites,and they are all in English, but the selection is good, giving prominence to those sites containing sec-ondary documents, such as critical summaries of the literature or synthesis documents, such asguidelines and systematic reviews.\nThis engine performs its searches by identifying the key word in the title and the text of each docu-\nment posted on the selected websites. The results are divided into five sections based on the fivecategories the selected websites are divided into. These sections are: EBM resources, question andanswer services, clinical practice guidelines, e-books on general medicine and scientific medical jour-nals.\nThe themes are also classified by clinical areas that are updated every month, and a Virtual Learn-\ning Centre has been launched, which features a course in continuing medical education. This isundoubtedly one of the main tools when looking for secondary information and when a quick overviewof a subject of clinical importance is needed.

It is the automated version of three indexes published previously. MED-LINE contains the bibliographical citations for the articles, together with other types of information,which will either help retrieve it (such as the \u00abkey word\u00bb field) or help find out about the subject ofthe article [such as the one indicated in the \u00absummary\u00bb field).Family and Community Medicine \nTraining Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s  26/7/06  10:46  P\u00e1gina 136PubMed is a component of the system known as Entrez , which integrates and links up information\nfrom other databases. It is, therefore, a search and retrieval interface on interconnected databasesthat use world-wide-web technologies and are accessible via the Internet.\nContrary to popular belief, PubMed is not a search programme used exclusively for the MEDLINE\ndatabase, but a search interface for bibliographical databases in the Entrez system. This means thatit allows access to bibliographical references on other databases that are not part of the originalMEDLINE. You can use PubMed\u2019s home page to view the databases and database subgroups acces-sible via PubMed. First, click on the \nLimits tab and then select the Subsets option.\nPubMed is unique insofar as it allows users to optimise their search semi-automatically, without them\nhaving to perform a specific action or know how the website works.

Along with other sources of information that emerged from within the bur-geoning evidence based medicine movement, its primary mission is to provide scientific informationthat will help people involved in the decision-making process. This information is given in the form ofsummaries of systematic reviews, clinical trials and reports evaluating the technologies which its writ-ers call the \u00abammunition\u00bb to achieve effectiveness.\nBandolier has become an important reference source for a wide range of healthcare workers, due\nto the quality of its contents, the usefulness of the information it contains, and its unusual, veryBritish sense of humour, all of which make it a pleasure to read. It mainly focuses on reviewing top-ics related to treatment [pharmacological or otherwise], diagnostic trials, health services and health-care management. Internet access to Bandolier is free and the print version is available by subscrip-tion. Back numbers can be obtained in electronic format or in print. Since issue 65, there has beena Spanish version of the journal which goes by the name of Bandolera, and contains all the articlesfeatured in the original English-language publication.
