However, I later learned about natural alternatives such as diatomaceous earth and coconut oil, which I found to be effective. I also took a naturopathy class and was shocked to learn about the importance of maintaining a healthy pH balance in ruminant animals to prevent parasites from thriving.\nOver 50% of a ruminant animal\u2019s food should be dried stocks, such as hay, which forces them to chew and produce more saliva, resulting in a lower stomach pH. This helps to strengthen their immune system and fight parasites more effectively.\nNatural Remedies for Parasite Management\nI have had personal success with using coconut oil to expel parasites from my animals. Feeding coconut oil to my larger animals caused parasites to come out of the skin and leave the body. I also used diatomaceous earth, which kills and dries up parasites, along with homeopathy to balance the body and create an unfriendly environment for parasites. I haven\u2019t had to worry about parasites in my animals for 20 years using these methods.\nThe Parasite De-worm Mini Kit\nI also recommend using a combination remedy called the parasite de-worm mini kit, which is alternated in the animals\u2019 water for 1 to 2 weeks. Additionally, treating the pasture or barnyard with diatomaceous earth can further control parasites. Diatomaceous earth is made of fossilized remains of tiny aquatic organisms and contains silica, which is beneficial for the body. However, it is important to avoid inhaling it or getting it in the eyes.\nHomeopathic Remedies for Parasites\nOn my website, I offer a pet parasite worm kit, as well as a list of homeopathic remedies for parasites. These remedies range from Aconite to Sulfur and cover a wide range of symptoms and types of parasites.\nTreating Worm Complaints in Children\nIt\u2019s also crucial to address worm complaints in children. While there are fewer remedies listed for children, Aconite, Belladonna, and Cina are among the top remedies for worm complaints in children.\nInterestingly, the moon\u2019s phases can influence worm complaints. Parasite problems can cause symptoms such as constipation, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. They can also affect animals and it\u2019s important to treat them regularly to maintain their health.\nIn conclusion, I encourage everyone to address parasite problems using homeopathy and natural means. It\u2019s a journey I\u2019ve been on for 20 years and I can confidently say that it\u2019s been effective for me. I hope my experiences and insights can help you on your journey too.\nThe content of the Homeopathy for Mommies Radio post or page, including text, graphics, images, or information contained in text or audio, or other content, is offered on an informational basis only.
