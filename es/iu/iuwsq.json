We lower economic and cultural barriers to provide the right care to everyone who needs it. We also know that health care doesn\u2019t start or end at the clinic, so we partner with our neighborhood organizations to engage individuals and families before they become patients. Across our system, we are building a strong community of care, where staff are recognized and valued, and patients are treated based on their unique needs by providers they trust. That\u2019s how we improve the health of our communities.\nOur Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly is the ideal solution for those who want an alternative to nursing home care for the right combination of medical, social, recreation, rehabilitation, home care, and other services. Visit the Neighborhood PACE page to learn more.\nOur secure online portal to your health information.\nDon't have an account yet?\nOur providers can evaluate, diagnose, and treat you using a
