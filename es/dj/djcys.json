The skills and knowledge you'll develop through the computer science program will complement your engineering expertise, and together they'll allow you to carve out a career in the high-tech industries of the future.\nUQ's engineering program offers the largest choice of engineering disciplines in Queensland, with 5 core specialisations and 14 majors to choose from. The flexible curriculum will equip you to work in both established and newly emerging areas of engineering.\nYou'll benefit from hands-on experiences across all aspects of engineering, more study options for greater career opportunities, and direct contact with industry \u2013 your future employers \u2013 threaded throughout your degree.\nComputer science combines the theoretical studies of algorithms and data structures with the practical challenges of implementing them in hardware and software systems. Through this program you'll develop the strong analytical, logical and development skills necessary to advance computing and its applications. You can specialise in cyber security, data science, machine learning, programming languages or scientific computing.\nYou'll graduate with qualifications that are highly valued and in demand, ready for an exciting career in leading-edge technology.\nBiomedical Engineering\nBiomedical engineers create materials, devices and processes for better health outcomes.\nBiomedical engineering bridges the gap between technology, medicine and biology. It integrates physical, chemical, mathematical and computational sciences and engineering principles with the ultimate aim of improving health care.\nBiomedical engineers may be involved in the design, construction and development of health and monitoring devices and computers, implantable devices, diagnostic systems and therapeutic systems, cell and tissue engineering, and pharmaceuticals. You may also work with models of physiological function and prosthetics and implants.\nDepending on your chosen specialisation, you may find employment with hospitals, biotechnology companies, medical equipment manufacturers, research institutes and government health departments.\n*El precio que se muestra es una referencia, por favor\n[verificar con la instituci\u00f3n](https://www.hotcoursesinternational.com/study/cpe-track.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffuture-students.uq.edu.au%2F%3Futm_source%3Dhotcourses_latinamerica%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dhotcourses)\nEsperado Julio 2024\nThe University of Queensland\nSt Lucia Campus,\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND,\nQueensland,\n4072, BRISBANE, Australia\nQueensland Year 12 (or equivalent) General English subject (Units 3 & 4, C); Mathematical Methods (Units 3 & 4, C); and one of Chemistry or Physics (Units 3 & 4, C).\nBoth Chemistry and Physics are recommended subjects.
