One of the amazing herbs that we've come to love is called Epazote. Our Maya healing garden is located on sacred Mayan land in Central America, where our research is currently underway. Epazote Usage & History Epazote (Chenopodium ambrosioides) is a herb that is widely used in Mexican, Maya, and Central American cuisine. While it is best known for its culinary uses, epazote has a number of potential health benefits as well. Epazote Benefits One of the primary benefits of epazote is its ability to relieve gastrointestinal issues such as flatulence, constipation, and bloating. This is because epazote contains compounds that are believed to relax the smooth muscles of the digestive tract, allowing for easier passage of gas and stool. In addition to its digestive benefits, epazote has also been shown to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. This means that it may be effective against a range of bacteria and viruses, and could potentially be useful in the treatment of conditions such as arthritis and asthma. Another potential benefit of epazote is its ability to lower blood sugar levels. Some studies have found that epazote may help to reduce blood glucose levels in people with diabetes, although more research is needed to confirm these findings. Epazote also contains a number of important vitamins and minerals, including calcium, iron, and vitamin C. These nutrients are essential for maintaining good health, and may be particularly beneficial for people who have dietary restrictions or are at higher risk for certain health conditions. One of the most interesting potential benefits of epazote, however, is its ability to repel insects. This is because epazote contains a compound called ascaridole, which is toxic to many insects and can be used as a natural insecticide. Some research has even suggested that epazote oil could be used as an alternative to synthetic insecticides, which can have negative impacts on the environment and human health. Overall, epazote is a versatile herb with a range of potential health benefits. While more research is needed to fully understand its effects, it is clear that epazote has a number of properties that make it an appealing addition to both culinary and medicinal uses. Whether you are looking to add some flavor to your cooking or are interested in the potential health benefits of natural remedies, epazote is a herb worth exploring further.", "sitename": "Relyf", "date": "2023-05-03", "id": null, "license": null, "body": null, "comments": "Dejar un comentario", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "[](/es/blogs/education/epazote-benefits-and-background-of-this-wonderful-herb)\nEpazote: Benefits and Background of this Wonderful Herb\nFor the past two years, we have been studying the effects of Central American herbs and Maya remedies in conjunction with CBD and their effects on the body.
