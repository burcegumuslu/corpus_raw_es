SCOPE  \n \nThis NASA Technical Standard  is directed toward materials and processes (M&P) used in the \ndesign, fabrication , and testing of space program flight hardware  for NASA , including but not \nlimited to  crewed , uncrewed , robotic, launc h vehicle, lander, in -space and surface systems , and \nspacecraft program/project hardware elements. All space flight hardware is covered by the M&P \nrequirements of this document, including vendor -designed, off -the-shelf, and vendor -furnished \nitems.   \n \nM&P  used in interfacing ground support equipment  (GSE ), test equipment , hardware processing \nequipment , hardware packaging , and hardware shipment is covered by the M&P requirements of \nthis NASA Technical Standard  only to the extent required to  prevent damage to o r contamination \nof space flight hardware  (see Section 4 .0). M&P used in NASA aircraft and aircraft operations \nare not covered by the M&P requirements of this document . \n1.1 Purpose  \n \nThe purpose of this NASA Technical Standard is to define the minimum require ments for M&P \nand to provide a general control specification for incorporation in NASA program/project \nhardware procurements and technical programs . \n \n1.2 Applicability  \n \nThe controls described here are applicable to all NASA spacecraft programs : \n \na. [MPR 1] Programs  shall  apply these controls to program/project hardware. Programs, \nprojects, and elements are responsible for flowing requirements down to contractors, \nsubcontractors, and the lowest component -level suppliers.   \n \nb. [MPR 2] Programs shall be responsible  for demonstrating compliance with these \nrequireme nts. \n \nThis NASA Technical Standard is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers  \nand Facilities and may be cited in contract, program, and other Agency documents as a technical \nrequirement.

For A -basis  strength pro perties , at \nleast 99% of the population of strength values is expected to equal or exceed this lower  \nbound with 95% confidence.  For B -basis, 90% of the population of strength values is \nexpected to equal or exceed this lower bound with 95% confidence.  For metallic \nmaterials S -basis design values , the statistics defined by MMPDS are the same as for A -\nbasis, but the test requirements are less comprehensive.  Numbers of lots and test \nspecimens required to develop design values  are defined in applicable standa rds.  The \nterms \u201cmaterial allowables,\u201d \u201cdesign allowables,\u201d and \u201cdesign values\u201d are commonly \nused to address the design values used in structural analysis . \n \nFretting Corrosion :  Occurs when two contacting surfaces under mechanical load \nare subjected to rep eated relative surface motion. Mechanical wear and material transfer \nat the surfaces can lead to corrosion, metallic debris, and increased contact resistance due \nto the electrical insulating properties of corrosion products that may build up at the \ncontact  interfaces.  \n \nMission Critical Ha rdware :  Hardware, the failure of which may result in the \ninability to retain operational capability for mission continuation if a corrective action is \nnot successfully performed.  \n \nNondestructive Evaluation (NDE) /Nondestruc tive Testing (NDT) :  Inspection \ntechniques which do not cause physical, mechanical, or chemical changes to the part \nbeing inspected or otherwise impair its adequacy for operational service. These \ninspection techniques are applied to materials and structure s to verify required integrity \nand to detect flaws.  \n \n Refractory Alloys :  Alloys with a melting point above 2000  \u00b0C (3632  \u00b0F), plus \nosmium and iridium.  \n \nSafety -Critical :  Term describing any condition, event, operation, process, \nequipment, or system th at could cause or lead to severe injury, major damage, or mission \nfailure if performed or built improperly, or allowed to remain uncorrected.  \n \n Structural :  Pertaining to  structure.  \n \n Structural Adhesive Bond :  Structural joint using adhesive bonds for  the purpose \nof transferring structural load between structures.

[MPR 33] A, B, or S -basis statistical values  for mechanical properties of materials \nshall  be utilized for  the design and analysis of hardware for all applications where structural \nanalysis is required.  \n \nStatistical design  values  are needed for any hardware where structural analysis is required in \norder to demonstrate positive margins of safety for the design loads and environments in \ncombination with the factor of safety requirements .  \n \nEach distinct form  of a material should be assumed to  have unique design values  unless testing \nand statistical analysis shows that design values  are combinable. For example, r olled bar may \nhave different design values  than the same alloy in plate, forging, spin forming, ext rusion, or \ncasting. Different layups affect the properties of composite structures. Manufacturing methods, \nlike welding, brazing, swaging, forming, diffusion bonding, adhesive bonding, and co -curing of \nsandwich alter the properties of the original material s. Design features, such as joints , ply-drops,  \nand tapered ramps affect the design values of composites.  \nDesign values are also required for other mechanical properties, such as dynamic properties like \nfatigue and fracture. The basis for these properties i s not necessarily statistical, but the sampling \nis expected to be representative of the material, product form, and state used in the design.  Some \napplications require lower bound, and others require typical properties.  The specific \nrequirement can be foun d in the governing specifications for the design, such as  \nNASA -STD-5019 , Fracture Control Requirements for Spaceflight Hardware,  or NASA -STD-\n5012 , Strength and Life Assessment Requirements for Liquid -Fueled Space Propulsion System \nEngines . \nb. [MPR 34] The sampling for other mechanical properties, such as dynamic properties \nlike fatigue and fracture , and verification of design values  shall be representative of the material, \nproduct form, and state used in the design.   \nThe statistical basis for fatigue and fracture properties should be consistent with the governing \nspecification. For example, NASA -STD-5019 allows for the use of typical fracture toughness and \ncrack growth rate properties in the assessment of assumed defects; NASA -STD-5012 requires the \nuse of bounding fatigue design curves for critical hardware in the primary load path. Fatigue \ndata provided in MMPDS requires further analysis to derive a bounded design curve.  \n \nc.

[MPR 3 6] For metallic materials, the alloy, heat treatment, product specification, \nproduct form, and thickness shall  match the alloy, heat treatment, product specification, product \nform, and thickness in MMPDS .   \n \nSince the testing to develop design values is specific to alloy, heat treatment, specification and \nform, the statistical relationship is relevant only to that same combination. Thickness affects \nstrength of metal because of metallurgical factors that influence strength, lik e heat transfer \nduring heat treatment and variability of reduction during metal working.   \n \nSAE CMH -17 is composed of six volumes :  SAE CMH -17-1G, Volume 1 \u2013 Polymer Matrix \nComposites Guidelines for Characterization of Structural Materials ; SAE CMH -17-2G, Volume \n2 \u2013 Polymer Matrix Composites Materials Properties ; SAE CMH -17-3G, Volume 3 \u2013 Polymer \nMatrix Composites Materials Usage, Design, and Analysis ; SAE CMH -17-4B, Volume 4 \u2013 Metal \nMatrix Composites ; MIL-HDBK -17-5, Volume 5 \u2013 Ceramic Matrix Composites ; and SAE CMH -\n17-6, Volume 6 \u2013 Structural Sandwich Composites . \n \nNote s:   \n(1) Design v alues of structural materials listed in later versions of MMPDS  or SAE \nCMH -17 than th ose specified in section 2 may be used provided the methodology \nused to de velop the allowable m echanical properties is at least as conservative.  \n \n(2) When released, SAE CMH -17-5 may be used in place of  MIL-HDBK -17-5.

In general, hydrogen environmental \nembrittlement represents the condition where the materials are exposed to a high -pressure \ngaseous hydrogen environment. The hydrogen for internal hydrogen embrittlement is usually not \nfrom a high -pressure gaseous system, but from an electrochemical process such as \nelectroplating, corrosion, cathodic charging, and even from thermal charging. The hydrogen for \ninternal hydrogen embrittlement can also come from moisture and enter the metals during \nwelding,  casting, and solidification processes from the foundry.  \n \nThe hydrogen environmental embrittlement and internal hydrogen embrittlement effects are \nsimilar in many instances and they both require an external applied stress in order for the \nhydrogen embritt lement effects to occur. In contrast, hydrogen reaction embrittlement is usually \nirreversible hydrogen damage caused by a chemical reaction with hydrogen and such damage \ncan occur without an external applied stress. This form of hydrogen damage can occur i n \nmaterials such as titanium, zirconium, and some types of iron or steel -based alloys.  \n \nOverall, hydrogen embrittlement of materials is not very well understood and only limited \nmaterials property data have been generated . NASA/ TM-2016 -218602 , Hydrogen \nEmbrittlement , provides a detailed description of hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms, a \ncomprehensive summary of existing hydrogen embrittlement data, and guidance on selection of \nmaterials and control of processes to prevent hydrogen embrittlement.

[MPR 19 4] Electrochemical  processes or exposure to acids or bases during \nmanufacturing or processing of space flight hardware that provides mission -critical functions  \nshall  be controlled to prevent hydrogen embrittlement , or embrittlement relief treatment shall be \nperformed promptly after processing . \n \n(1) [MPR 19 5] When acid cleaning baths or plating processes are used  on steel parts  \nfor space flight hardware that provides mission -critical functions , the part shall be \nbaked in accordance with SAE  AMS 2759/9 D, Hydrogen Embrittlement Relief \n(Baking) of Steel Parts, to alleviate potential hydrogen embrittlement problems.  \n \n4.2.6.5  Intermetallic Compounds  \n \nWhen joini ng two or more metals together (soldering, wire bonding, etc.), intermetallic \ncompounds can form that are problematic to the metal joint, leading to a weakened mechanical \nor electrical connection. Problems can arise from embrittlement, changes in density, or \nconductivity of the  intermetallic compound. Gold -indium and gold -tin are two of the more \ncommon systems that form intermetallic compounds that will degrade a metal joint.  \n \n4.2.6.5.1  Gold -Indium Intermetallic Formation  \n \nIndium reacts with gold to form a succession of gold -indium intermetallic compounds. The gold -\nindium intermetallic compounds occupy a volume approximately four times the original volume \nof the consumed gold and are brittle. The original mechanical and thermal properties of gold are \ndegrade d by this intermetallic reaction possibly resulting in unreliable electrical \ninterconnection s. The gold -indium intermetallic formation progresses significantly even at room \ntemperature and accelerates at elevated temperatures.  \n \n[MPR 19 6] Gold shall  not be used in contact with indium or an indium alloy (such as indium \nsolder) for space flight hardware that provides mission -critical functions.  \n \n4.2.6.5.2  Gold -Tin Intermetallic Formation  \n \nThe combination of gold and tin is subject to two distinct degradation me chanisms:  gold \nembrittlement of tin -based solder joints and fretting corrosion of gold -coated contacts when \nmated with tin or tin alloy -coated contacts.   \n NASA -STD -6016 B \nNOTE :  Per section 4.1.6 :  The use of M&P  that do not comply with the requirements of this NASA Technical S tandard may be acceptable in the \nactual hardware applications. MUAs are required  for all M&P  that are technically acceptable but do not meet the requirem ents of this  NASA \nTechnical  Standard, as implemented by the approved Materials and Processes Selection, Control, and Implementation Plan.  \n \nAPPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE \u2014DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED  \n \n66 of 155 When tin -based solder is used to join gold -plated surfaces, the gold coatings will dissolve into \nthe final solder joint. If the concentration of gold in the tin -based solder joint exceeds \napproximately 3 percent by weight, then a brittle gold -tin intermetallic compound may form \nwithin the joint that can impact the long -term reliability of the solder joi nt.  \n \n a. [MPR 19 7] When used with tin -based solder joints in mission -critical hardware, gold \nshall  be removed from at least 95  percent  of the surface to be soldered of all component leads, \ncomponent terminations, and solder terminals.  \n \nA double tinning p rocess or dynamic solder wave may be used for gold removal prior to \nmounting the component on the assembly.  \n \nThe combination of one gold -coated surface and one tin -coated or tin -alloy -coated surface for \nseparable contact interfaces (e.g., electrical conne ctor contact pairs) is highly prone to fretting \ncorrosion, which can build up an electrically insulating tin -oxide film at the contact interface, \nresulting in increased contact resistance.  \n \n b. [MPR 19 8] Gold -coated contacts shall  not be mated with tin or tin alloy -coated \ncontacts for separable contact interfaces in mission -critical hardware.  \n \n4.2.6.5.3  Gold -Aluminum Intermetallic Formation  \n \nAn aluminum -rich intermetallic phase, the AuAl 2 intermetallic  known as \u201cPurple Plague ,\u201d is \ninherent (and not necessa rily harmful) to gold -aluminum brazing ; however,  if excessive heat is \napplied too much of the intermetallic can form at the braze/part interface, causing joint failure.  \nA gold -rich phase, the Au 5Al2 intermetallic  known as \u201cWhite Plague ,\u201d is always d etrime ntal. It s \nformation  is catalyzed by s ilicon, so care should  be taken to keep the braze joint zone free of \ncontamination.    \n \na. [MPR 19 9] Gold -aluminum brazing processes shall be controlled to minimize \nformation of the AuAl 2 intermetallic known as \u201cPurple P lague\u201d and prevent formation of the \nAu5Al2 intermetallic known as \u201cWhite Plague.\u201d  \n \nPurple Plague  is a significant problem in microelectronic applications, because a s purple  \nplague forms, it reduces in volume. This creates cavities in the metal surrounding the purple \nplague, which increases electrical resistance and structurally weakens the wire bonding.  White \nplague is worse, because it has low electrical conductivity  and, i f enough of it forms, the \nresulting electrical resistance can cause a total failure of the component.  \n \nb. [MPR 200] Gold -aluminum bonding processes shall be controlled to prevent the \nformation of the AuAl 2 intermetallic known as \u201cPurple Plague\u201d and the Au5Al2 intermetallic \nknown as \u201cWhite Plague.\u201d  \n NASA -STD -6016 B \nNOTE :  Per section 4.1.6 :  The use of M&P  that do not comply with the requirements of this NASA Technical S tandard may be acceptable in the \nactual hardware applications.

Incorporating a general control specification provides \nprocedural requirements for programmatic and M&P oversight to ensure that the M&P minimum \nrequirements are implemented, controlled, and verified. These M&P minimum requirements are  \nderived mostly from a history of successful use by NASA and the aerospace industry of best \npractices and lessons learned; their imposition better ensure s uniformity, interoperability,  a high \nlikelihood of reliable hardware, and ultimately, mission success .   \n \nThe purpose of this appendix is to provide the justification for each of the mandatory minimum \nrequirements that are imposed by NASA -STD -6016 A.

Since the disturbed metal layer has \na certain depth, it is required that at \nleast an amount of metal equal to \nthe thickness of the disturbed layer \nbe removed to have an effective \npenetrant inspection.    \n4.2.5.2 c NDE Etching  [MPR 18 0] If etching is not feasible, it \nshall be demonstrated that the required \nflaw size can be reliably detected.  Since not being able to etch means \nthat the penetrant inspection \nprocess would be ineffective, it is \nnecessary to employ other  NDE \nmethods, such as eddy current or \nultrasonics that can detect the \ncritical flaw size.  \n   \n4.2.6.1 a Residual Stresses  [MPR 18 1] Estimates of r esidual stresses \nin structural or stress -corrosion -sensitive \nhardware shall be considered  in structural \nanalyse s and corrosion/stress -corrosion \nassessments.  Many metal processes produce \nresidual stresses that can add to the \nstresses from the normally applied \nservice stresses resulting in a higher \nstress state that needs to be \naddressed and accounted for in the \nanalyses.   \n \nAn important lesson was learned in   NASA -STD -6016 B \n \nNOTE:  Per section 4.1.6:  The use of M&P  that do not comply with the technical requirements of this NASA Technical S tandard may be acceptable in the actual hardware applications.

However, when \nwide specimens containing only a \nshort repair -welded area were \ntensile tested, the residual stress \nadded to the discontinuity shear \nstress at the weld/parent metal \ninterface, causing early failure.   \n4.2.6.1 b Residual Stresses  [MPR 18 2] The straightening of warped \nparts in structural hardware shall require \nan approved MUA.
