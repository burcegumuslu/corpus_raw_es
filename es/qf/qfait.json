It includes many different modalities, such as Acupuncture, Moxibustion, Cupping, Tuina, Gasha, and Herbology.\nAcupuncture is a painless insertion of tiny sterile needles into Acupuncture points.

This can lead to activation of pathways affecting various physiological systems in the brain as well as the periphery. The NIA Consensus also says that Acupuncture may activate the Hypothalamus and Pituitary gland, resulting in a broad spectrum of systemic effects.\n-\nAddition \u2013 alcohol, drugs, smoking\n-\nAnxiety\n-\nArthritis\n-\nAsthma\n-\nBronchitis\n-\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome\n-\nChemical Sensitivities\n-\nChronic Fatigue / Fibromyalgia\n-\nColitis\n-\nColds and Flu\n-\nConstipation\n-\nDental Pain, Gum Disease\n-\nDepression\n-\nDiarrhea\n-\nDigestive Trouble\n-\nDizziness\n-\nDysentery\n-\nEye Problems\n-\nFacial Tics\n-\nFatigue\n-\nHeadaches / Migraines\n-\nHepatitis\n-\nIncontinence\n-\nIndigestion\n-\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome\n-\nLow Back Pain\n-\nMenopause\n-\nMenstrual Irregularities\n-\nNausea, Vomiting\n-\nOsteoarthritis\n-\nPain\n-\nParalysis\n-\nPMS\n-\nPneumonia\n-\nPrenatal, pregnancy, and post-partum\n-\nReproductive problems\n-\nSciatica\n-\nShoulder pain\n-\nSinusitis\n-\nSleep disturbances\n-\nStress\n-\nTennis elbow\n-\nTonsillitis\n-\nTrigeminal Neuralgia\nAcupuncture is recognized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to be effective in the treatment of:\nPediatric Acupuncture\nPediatric Acupuncture can treat a variety of children\u2019s disease by stimulating the body to heal itself without drugs that may cause unwanted side effects.
