The future of the bivalve mollusk  production sector worldwide is still challenged by emergence \nand propagation of new diseases, mainly vibriosis, and the conventional methods that have been used to \neradicate pathogens from hatcheries, such as antibiotics and chemotherapies have shown coll ateral effects. In \norder to reduce the use of conventional methods, homeopathy for aquaculture emerges as a novel solution to \nstrengthen marine organism\u2019s defense against diseases. This study evaluated the effect of five homeopathic \ntreatments on the immun omodulatory response and general condition index of Argopecten ventricosus  juveniles, \nused as model organisms due to their susceptibility to vibriosis compared to other commercial bivalves. The \nexperimental design included three replicates of five homeopat hic treatments at decimal (D) or centesimal (C) \ndynamiz ation (T1: ViA 1D + ViP 1D, T2: ViA 7C + ViP 7C, T3: AcF 1D + MsS 1D, T4: PhA 7C + SiT 7C and \nT5: ViT 31C) and three control groups (C1: Dynamized Ethanol (1C), C2: Diluted Ethanol (1:99) and C3: No \nmedication). The maximum immunomodulatory response was attributed to treatments T1 and T2 with the \nhighest increase in hemocyte count, catalase activity in mantle and superoxide dismutase activity in gills, \nfollowed by treatments T3 and T5. Treatment T4 did not show a definite effect on an immune response but \nincreased energetic reserves in the mantle, muscle and the digestive gland, important storage tissues in mollusk \nbivalves. This study has demonstrated that some homeopathic treatments can activate an imm unomodulatory \nresponse and improve the general condition index in A. ventricosus .  \nKeywords:  bivalve; aquacultural homeopathy; immunomodulatory response; superoxide dismutase; catalase  \n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION  \nThe future of the bivalve mollusk production sector \nworldwide is still challenged by the emergence and \npropagation of new diseases  that are strongly \ninfluenced by water temperature increase due to global \nwarming (Murray et al., 2012; Wendling et al., 2014; \nSemenza et al ., 2017)  and organism mobilization \n(Murray et al ., 2012 ). The main limiting factor for \nhatchery spat production in sea bivalves is the high \nmortality associated with the disease caused mainly by \nVibrio  spp, and moreover, by Aeromon as spp. in early -\nstage development (Kesarcodi -Watson et al ., 2008 ; \nSivasankar et al ., 2017; Stentiford et al ., 2017). \nConventional methods such as antibiotics have been  \n \n__________________  \nCorresponding editor: C\u00e9sar Lodeiros  used to combat diseases by attacking pathogenic bacteria, \nbut they negatively affect beneficial  gastrointestinal \nmicrobiota (Romero et al., 2012), and their prolonged \nuse generates antibiotic resistance in more pathogenic \nbacterial strains (Lawrence & Jeyakumar, 2013). Even \ngovernments and organizations in different parts of the \nworld have been restricting the use of antibiotics in \nanimal production (Kesarcodi -Watson et al., 2008), but \nat the same time, there is an increasing need for finding \nalternativ e ways to control microbial diseases in \naquaculture.  \nTo avoid the massive use of antibiotics, scientists \nhave been searching for sustainable alternatives as \nimmunostimulant (Wang et al., 2017) with probiotics \n(Prado et al ., 2010; Abasolo -Pacheco et al ., 20 17),  \n \n \n \n66                                                           Latin American Journal of Aquatic Research  \n \n \nantimicrobial essential oils (Romero et al ., 2012), \ninhibition of virulence genes expression in pathogenic \nbacteria (Dubert et al ., 2017)  and recently proposed \nhomeopathic drugs (Maz\u00f3n -Su\u00e1stegui et al., 2017).  \nHomeopathy, an innocuous and eco -friendly \nalternative, has been proposed to strengthen biological \nsystems against diseases and uses dilutions  from \ndecimal (low -dilution) to millesimal (very high -\ndilution) potencies (Bellavite & Signorini, 2002). \nHomeopathy has been considered a pioneer in nano -\nmedicine application for human health because even in \nhigh-dilution homeopathic drugs, nanoparticles o f the \noriginal compound have been found (Bell et al., 2013). \nThe action mode of these drugs depends on the potency \nof the homeopathic drug. Low dilutions effects are \nattributed to high diluted molecules and nanoparticles, \nwhile high dilutions effects are a ttributed to \nnanoparticles and electromagnetic fields (Bellavite et \nal., 2014a). These signals or molecules generates \nendogenous amplification that include hormesis  \n(phenomena where a compound at high concentrations \nproduce a harmful effect and at low conc entration, a \nbeneficial effect), time -dependent sensitization and \nstochastic resonance process (Bell et al ., 2013; \nBellavite et al., 2014b) . Homeopathic drugs have been \npreviously used in animals, plants, humans and in vitro  \nresearch (Bellavite & Signorini, 2002; Bellavite et al., \n2014b), showing encouraging results in the activation \nof the immune response, stress reduction, nutrient  \nassimilation increase and as growth promoters \n(Bellavite & Signorini, 2002; Bellavite et al ., 2006; \nCamerlink et al., 2010; Merlini et al., 2014; Di as-Neto \net al., 2017). Most studies have been done in humans, \nwhile for aquatic organisms, information is scarce. Nile \ntilapia Oreochromis niloticus  has been the most studied \naquatic species in the evaluation of homeopathic drugs \neffect. Researches have be en reported changes for O. \nniloticus  in lipid metabolism (Andretto et al ., 2014), \nstress reduction (Merlini et al., 2014), survival (Dias -\nNeto et al ., 2017) and growth (Merlini et al ., 2014) \nwhen organisms are treated with homeopathic \ncomplexes.  \nRecently, homeopathic drugs formulated from \nsilica, phosphoric acid, Vidatox\u00ae (Havana, Cuba) and \npathogenic bacteria have been successfully used in \nmarine organisms to improve and strength their \nimmune systems (Ortiz -Cornejo et al ., 2017). In \nmollusks, homeopathic d rugs have been used as a novel \nsolution to aid overpass bacterial attack by improving \nimmune response. In Catarina scallop Argopecten \nventricosus , spat improved survival and increased \nsuperoxide dismutase (SOD) activity when challenged \nagainst Vibrio algin olyticus , a highly pathogenic \nbacteria (Maz\u00f3n -Su\u00e1stegui et al., 2017), suggesting that homeopathic drugs have immunological properties and \npotential protection against vibriosis. Nonetheless, \ncurrent scientific knowledge of the use of homeopathic \ndrugs in marine bivalves and their implication in the \nantioxidant system and general condition is scarce.  \nThis study aimed to determine the effect of five \nhomeopathic treatments, that previously shown an \nimmunomodulatory response (Ortiz -Cornejo et al ., \n2017), on g rowth, antioxidant system, hemocytes count \nand general condition index in Catarina scallop \njuveniles under laboratory conditions. This pectinid \nspecies was selected as marine bivalve model because \nit is an important resource in the Baja California \nPeninsul a and highly susceptible to vibriosis (Luna -\nGonz\u00e1lez et al., 2002)  which causes massive mortalities \nat their early -life stage. Therefore, the objective of this \nstudy was to assess the potential of homeopathy for \naquaculture as a new eco -sustainable alternative to \nimprove hatchery production of spat for aquaculture \npurposes.  \nMATERIALS AND METHODS  \nOrigin of scallops and experimental design  \nA total of 1,500 Cat arina scallops (average length  1.98 \n\u00b1 0.1 cm) were collected from culture cages at La Paz \nBay, Mexico (24\u00b09\u20195\u201dN; 110\u00b020\u201910\u201dW) in March \n2016. Scallops were transported to the mollusk s \nlaboratory at Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del \nNoroeste  (CIBNOR) and maintained in a nursery \nupwelling recirculating system at 24\u00b0C with a food \nconcentration around 150,000 cel mL-1 (Isochrysis \ngalbana  and Chaetoceros calcitrans in proportion 1:1) \nfor acclimatization for one week. Filtered (1 \u00b5m) and \nUV-irradi ated seawater was continuously provided (24 \nh), which allows water changed every day.  \nAfter acclimatization, scallops were transferred to \n24 experimental units (36  L container) with 52 scallops \neach. During the experimental period (21 days), \nscallops were  kept in an open -recirculating flow system \nthat provided filtered and treated sea water (1 \u00b5m, \nactivated carbon and UV irradiation) with a mix of \nmicroalgae I. galbana  and C. calcitrans  (199,607,794 \ncel ind-1 d-1) at 23.5 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C.  \nFive experimental homeop athic treatments (T1, T2, \nT3, T4, and T5) and three control treatments (C1, C2, \nand C3) were assayed, including three replicates for \neach experimental condition. To avoid and detect \npotential side effects of ethanol vehicle in homeopathic \ntreatments, C1 co ntained diluted (1:100) but not \nsuccussed ethanol; C2 diluted 1:100 and succussed \nethanol (1C); and C3 neither homeopathic drug or \nethanol added. Ethanol is the most typical dilution -Evaluation of immunomodulatory drugs in Argopecten ventricosus                                                   67 \n \n \nsuccussion vehicle used in human homeopathic drugs \n(Bellavite & Signorini , 2002), but it may trigger \nphenoloxidase activity in shrimps (Hern\u00e1ndez -L\u00f3pez et \nal., 1996). Distilled water was used as the final dilution \nvehicle in all \"working\" (decimal or centesimal) \nhomeopathic dynamizations to avoid this potential \neffect.  \nThe ope n flow was cut off three hours a day to avoid \nthe presence of microalgae and permits homeopathic or \ncontrol treatments were directly added to seawater in \nthe experimental units (100 \u00b5l L-1), a dose that had \nproved to strengthen the immune system in A. \nventricosus  (Maz\u00f3n -Su\u00e1stegui et al., 2017). During this \ntime, water recirculation pattern in each experimental \nunit was maintained to promote intake of homeopathic \nand control substances added to juvenile scallops. \nGrowth and survival were measured every week.  At the \nbeginning (T o, day 0) and the end of the experiment \n(day 21), 18 scallops were randomly collected from \neach treatment for analysis purposes (six scallops per \nunit). For the histological analysis, the whole scallop \nmeat was fixed in Davidson solutio n. For biochemical \nand enzymatic analysis muscle, digestive gland, gills, \nand mantle were excised and maintained at -80\u00b0C.  \nHomeopathic drug formulation  \nHomeopathic treatments T1 (ViP 1D + ViA 1D) and T2 \n(ViP 7C + ViA 7C) were homeopathic dynamizations  \ndeveloped at CIBNOR, formulated in decimal (T1) or \ncentesimal (T2) dilutions/succussions from a mother \ntincture of pathogenic strains of Vibrio  parahaemolyticus  \n(CAIM 170; www.ciad.mx/caim \u00bb ViP) and Vibrio \nalginolyticus  (CAIM 57; www.ciad.mx/caim \u00bb ViA),  \nwhich have been related to high mortalities in marine \nbivalves. For each strain, mother tincture was prepared \nfollowing the homeopathic principles that consisted of \nwet biomass obtained by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, \n4\u00b0C, 20 min) of 2 L of Vibrio  culture in marine broth \n2216 (105.1\u00d710-6 CFU mL-1). Wet biomass (15 mL) \nwas fully inactivated by three freeze -unfreeze cycles of \n-80 and 24\u00b0C; between each cycle, strain biomass was \nvortexed at 3,200 rpm (Benchmark mixer\u2122, \nBenchmark Scientific Inc.) for 2 min. The  inactivated \nproduct was diluted (1:1) in ethanol 87% (Similia\u00ae \npurchased at Farmacia Homeop\u00e1tica Nacional\u00ae, \nMexico City, MX) and vortexed at 3,200 rpm \n(Benchmark mixer\u2122, Benchmark Scientific Inc.) for 2 \nmin. Concentrate diluted in ethanol was again diluted \n(1:100) in ethanol 87% (Similia\u00ae) and vortexed 2 min \nat 3,200 rpm (Benchmark mixer\u2122, Benchmark \nScientific Inc.) to get a final mother tincture, from \nwhich, decimal (D, 1:10) and centesimal (C, 1:100) \nhomeopathic dynamizations were prepared by \nsucce ssive dilution and succussion process (3,200 rpm, 2 min, Benchmark mixer\u2122, Benchmark Scientific Inc.) \nuntil reach dynamization 1D (1:10) and 7C (1:1014). \nHomeopathic treatment T3 (AcF 1D + MsS 1D) was \ndeveloped from sodium metasilicate and phosphoric \nacid mother tinctures. Analytic grade phosphoric acid \n86% (Faga Lab\u00ae, Guamuchil, MX) was considered as \nmother tincture, while the sodium metasilicate mother \ntincture was prepared by mixing sodium metasilicate \n(9.4 g) in distilled water at room temperature (25\u00b0C ) \nuntil the solution reached saturation. Both mother \ntinctures were succussed and diluted (1:10) to have the \ndynamization 1D of each formulation.  \nHomeopathic treatments T4 (PhA 7C + SiT 7C) and \nT5 (ViD 31C) were elaborated from commercial \nhomeopathic drugs . Treatment T4 consisted of \ncentesimal (C) preparations (1:100 dilution/succussion) \nof the commercial homeopathic drugs Phosphoricum \nacid\u00ae 6C (PhA, dilution 1 \u00d71012) and Silicea terra\u00ae 6C \n(SiT, dilution 1 \u00d71012), while treatment T5 (ViD 31C) \nconsisted of a c entesimal homeopathic dynamization \n(1:100 dilution/succussion) of a commercial homeo -\npathic drug (VidatoX\u00ae 30CH, dilution 1\u00d71060; \nLabiofam\u00ae, Havana, Cuba ) made from the venom of \nthe blue scorpion Rhopalurus junceus . Distilled water \nwas used as a final dilution vehicle.  \nHaemocyte count  \nThe hemocyte count was assessed to prove immune \nsystem activation by following the methodology of \nBianchi et al . (2015 ). Three selected digital images \ntaken from digestive gland tissue, which showed higher \nhemocytes proliferation than other tissues, at 100x were \nprocessed with Image Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, \nBethesda, MD,  USA) to count the number of \nhemocytes seen in a tissue area (0.21 mm2). \nAntioxidant enzymatic activity  \nFrom each sample, previously stored at -80\u00b0C, 0.1 g of \ntissue was homogenized in phosphate buffer 50 mM, \npH 7.8 (1:5) to determine enzymatic biochemical  \nactivity, using glass beds and a fast prep (2 cycles, 4 m \ns-1, 30 s) equipment. Samples were centrifuged (13,000 \nrpm, 4\u00b0C, 10 min) and the supernatant was recovered \nto obtain the final enzymatic extract.  \nSuperoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) \nactivity were measured to understand the effect of \nhomeopathic treatments on the antioxidant system of \nthe Catarina scallop. The SOD activity was determined \nusing the SOD determination kit (Sigma -Aldrich \n#19160) which measures the percentage of a water -\nsoluble tetrazolium salt (WST -1) formazan complex \ninhibition. The protein content of the enzyme extract \nwas measured using Bradford reagent (Sigma -Adrich 68                                                           Latin American Journal of Aquatic Research  \n \n \n#B6916) to express SOD activity as U mg protein-1. \nThe CAT activity was determined by the method of \nClair borne (1985), where H 2O2 decomposition was \ndetermined, and one unit of enzyme activity was \ndefined as the amount of enzyme required to degrade 1 \nmmol of H 2O2 in 1 min.  \nHistological analysis  \nDavidson preserved scallops from each treatment and \nsampling were  dehydrated, embedded in Paraplast XT \n(SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, USA), cut at 4  \u00b5m \nsections, mounted in glass slides and stained with \nhematoxylin -eosin (Kim et al ., 2006). From the \nhematoxylin -eosin stain,  three randomly selected \ndigital images taken  at 20 x were processed with Image \nPro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) \nin three tissues (smooth and striated muscles and \ndigestive gland). The information was used to \ndetermine the gross physiological condition of \njuveniles using digestive g land index (DGI), smooth \nmuscle index (SmMI) and striated muscle index (StMI) \nas described by Maz\u00f3n -Su\u00e1stegui et al ., (2009) . The \nfollowing formula calculated the DGI:  \nDGI (%) = (CAA  / TCA ) \u00d7 100         (1) \nwhere CAA is the coverage area of the individual \nadenomeres (\u00b5m2), and TCA is the total coverage area \nof the image (\u00b5m2). \nMuscular indexes (SmMI, StMI) were determined \nby the formulae:  \nSmMI (%)\u2008=\u2008(CAIM / TCA )\u2008\u00d7\u2008100        (2) \nStMI (%)=(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc40 / \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc34 )\u00d7100          (3) \nwhere CAIM is the coverage area of individual muscle -\nfiber packages (\u00b5m2), and TCA is the total coverage \narea of the image (\u00b5m2). \nBiochemical analyses  \nBiochemical composition of soft tissues was assessed \nby triplicate. Samples previously stored at -80\u00b0C were \nlyophilized, re -hydrated in 1 mL cold distilled water, \nand homogenized to obtain crude extracts that were \nthen used to determine carbohydrate, protein, and lipid \ncontents. Determination of  total proteins was done \nusing the method of Smith et al. (1985), which uses a \nBCA reagent (Sigma -Aldrich #B9643) and bovine \nserum albumin (Sigma -Aldrich #9048 -46-8) as the \nstandard; absorbance was read at 562 nm. Carbohydrate \ncontent was determined according to Roe et al. (1961), \nusing a reagent blank and dextrose solution as the \nstandard (Vedco #3803); absorbance was read at 630 \nnm. The lipid content in tissues was dete rmined by the \nsulpho -phospho -vanillin method following a modified \nversion of Barnes & Blackstock (1973) using a microplate with 20\u03bcL supernatant extract previously \ndigested with sulphuric acid and 200 \u03bcL lipid reactive \nsolution (phosphor -vanillin 0.2% and sulphuric acid \n80%). A mix of triglycerides and cholesterol (Sigma -\nAldrich Lin -Trol B -1153) was used as a standard; \nabsorbance was recorded at 540 nm.  \nGrowth and survival  \nGrowth and survival of scallops during the experiment \nwere evaluated every week for 2 1 days by sampling 30 \nind per replicate. Survival was assessed identifying \norganisms as either alive or dead and removing dead \norganisms from the experimental units to prevent poor \nwater quality. Growth in length was assessed taking a \nsample of each unit a nd digital images were taken to \nmeasure organisms shell length using the program \nImage Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, \nUSA).  \nStatistical analysis  \nFor each triplicate, data normality was initially \nanalyzed  with the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test and then \nconfirmed with the Levene test for homogeneity of \nvariances. For histological analysis percentage values \nwere transformed using arcsine (Zar, 2010). After that, \none-way analyses of variance (n  = 3, triplicate expe ri-\nmental units) were run to assess significant differences \nin the histological indexes, biochemical composition \nand enzymatic tissue activity between treatments. As \nneeded, post -hoc multiple range mean comparisons \nwith Tukey\u2019s test (HSD) were performed. T he level of \nsignificance was set at  P < 0.05 for all analyses. All data \nwere analyzed using the program Statistica\u00ae 10.0 \nsoftware (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA) and expressed as \nmean \u00b1 95% confidence interval.  \nRESULTS  \nInfluence of homeopathic drugs on hemocyte  count  \nThe hemocyte count in digestive gland tissue showed a \nmarked effect of homeopathic treatments. The counts \nfor organisms from treatments T1 (44), T2 (41) and T3 \n(36) were significantly higher ( P < 0.05) than \norganisms at T o and all control groups (16 -34) (Fig. 1).  \nInfluence of homeopathic drugs on enzymatic \nbiochemistry  \nSuperoxide dismutase (SOD)  \nThe highest SOD activity in muscle ( P < 0.05) was \nobserved at the T o (11 U mg protein-1) compared to all \nexperimental groups (8 -9 U mg protein-1) except for  con- \ntrol group C2 (10 U mg protein-1) which was \nformulated with diluted and succussed ethanol (Fig. 2a).

The growth rate in shell length \nshowed an effect by h omeopathic treatment. \nTreatments T1 (117 \u00b5m) and T2 (108 \u00b5m) had the \nhighest increase in length ( P < 0.05) and were \nsignificantly different from controls C1 (14 \u00b5m), C2 \n(34 \u00b5m) and C3 (20 \u00b5m) (Fig. 5b).  \nDISCUSSION  \nThis study revealed that homeopathic treat ment \nformulated from pathogenic bacteria at decimal and \ncentesimal dilutions (1D, 7C) had the potential to \nactivate immunomodulatory response and antioxidant \nsystem of the scallop Argopecten ventricosus , accom -\npanied  with increases in growth, followed by those \nformulated from sodium metasilicates -phosphoric acid \nand Vidatox\u00ae as it is described below. Several authors \nhave reported that homeopathic treatments work on the \nimmune system (Bellavite et al., 2006, 2014b; Bel l & \nSchwartz, 2015). Particularly in marine organisms, \nhomeopathic treatments from pathogenic bacteria, \nVidatox\u00ae, and phosphoric acid, have been observed  72                                                           Latin American Journal of Aquatic Research  \n \n \n \nFigure 5.  a) Survival and b) growth rate of Argopecten \nventricosus  juveniles treated with homeopathic drugs for \n21 days. Values are mean \u00b1 confidence intervals at 95%. \nDifferent letters denote significant differences ( P < 0.05).  \n \nto produce an immunomodulatory response (Maz\u00f3n -\nSu\u00e1stegui et al. , 2017; Ortiz -Cornejo et al., 2017).  \nIn marine bivalves, hemocytes can be found in \ntissues because had an open circulatory system \n(Beninger & Le Pennec, 2006), and some authors have \nfound differences at hemocytes count only in tissue and \nnot in hemolymph (Cochennec -Laureau et al., 2003). \nWe propose to measure the hemocytes count in the \ndigestive gland tissue which showed higher hemocyte \nproliferation compared to other tissues. As hemocytes \nmigrates to the tissues where danger signal are \nrecognized, it was assumed that homeopathic \ntreatments compounds are mainly recognized at \ndigestive gland tissue; however, more investigation \nmust be done to confirm this idea.  \nHaemocyte count was highly influenced by the \nhomeopathic treatments formulated from pathogenic \nbacteria, followed by sodium metasilicate -phosphoric \nacid and Vidatox\u00ae. Homeopathic treatment formulated \nby pathogenic bacteria showed the high hemocytes \ncounts which were one to three times higher than \ncontrols (C3, C2, and C1). Increases of hemocytes 1.4 \ntimes higher compared with c ontrols have been \npreviously related to the activation of the immune \nresponse in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum  and R. \ndecussatus  (Oubella et al ., 1993). Also, increases of \nthese immune related cells have demonstrated to \nimprove immune response when orga nisms are a \nchallenge against pathogens (Prado -Alvarez et al ., \n2015). The increase in hemocyte count has been \nconsidered as an indicator of the activation of the immune system response since they are the main \ncellular effectors and act as defense mechanism s in \nbivalves (Canesi et al., 2002; Song et al., 2010). The \nfact that homeopathic treatment formulated by \npathogenic bacteria allowed an increase in the \nhaemocyte count could be supported by the presence of \ndiluted pathogenic compounds ( e.g., toxins, lipopoly -\nsaccharides, beta glucans) from Vibrio  cells and the \nrecognitions of specific epitopes, which are the part of \nthe antigen recognized by the immune system.  \nIncrease in hemocyte proliferation had been \nassociated to the recognition of pathogen -associ ated \nmolecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition \nreceptors (PRRs), which are molecules involved in the \nrecognition process that triggers immune system \nreaction (Song et al ., 2010; Wang et al ., 2013), but \ntoxins (Prego -Faraldo et al ., 2017)  and nanoparticles \n(Moyano et al., 2012) can also be detected as danger \nsignals and stimulate immune response. In very high \ndiluted homeopathic treatments, the presence of \nnanoparticles from the initial molecules has been \ndetected (Chikramane et al ., 2012; Bell & Schwartz, \n2015) . Homeopathy effect has been attributed to a \nresponse of a low intensity silent danger signal, \ninvolving nanoparticles and high diluted compounds, \nwhere endogenous amplif ication may involve  hormesis, \ntime-dependent sensitization and stochastic resonance \n(Bell et al ., 2013 ). Some authors have successfully \nimproved organism health and resistance to disease \nusing the same bacteria to formulate the homeopathic \ntreatment (Camerlink et al., 2010; Maz\u00f3n -Su\u00e1stegui et \nal., 2017; Ortiz -Cornejo et al ., 2017), although most \nstudies  that have proven immune stimulation with \nbacteria have been carried out using inactivated \npathogenic strains (Balseiro et al., 2013; Pauletto et al., \n2014) . This study supports the effect of the \nhomeopathic drug formulated by pathogenic bacteria at \nlow and high dilutions, as both dilutions 1D (1\u00d7101) \nand 7C (1\u00d71014) promotes an increase of hemocytes  \ncount. The effects of these homeopathic treatments \nwere attributed to micro -particles ( e.g., epitopes) or \nhighly diluted compounds from pathogenic bacteria \nthat can trigger an immune response. It must be noticed \nthat immunostimulants effect had been attri buted to \nPAMPS like peptoglican and lipopoly -saccharides, \nhowever, the application of homeopathic treatment \nformulated by bacteria, which are un -expensive and \nmay imply a complex diversity of high diluted epitopes, \nhad never been evaluated in A. ventriocos us. \nThe immune activation caused by the homeopathic \ntreatments from sodium metasilicate -phosphoric acid \nand Vidatox\u00ae were in accordance to the results reported \nby Ortiz -Cornejo et al. (2017) , and it is believed that \nthese treatments could be worked by the effect of \ndiluted compounds and nanoparticles as well. Scarce \nEvaluation of immunomodulatory drugs in Argopecten ventricosus                                                   73 \n \n \ninformation is available about homeopathic treatments \nfrom sodium metasilicates, but at non -homeopathic \nconcentrations, they have shown anti -inflammatory \nproperties in murine macrophages and pro ved \neffectiveness in scavenging free radicals when used at \n1, 5, 10 and 50 \u00b5M concentrations (Kim et al., 2013) , a \nconcentration close to our 1D dilution. In rats, the \naddition of sodium metasilicates has been associated to \na beneficial action because silica in physiological \namounts influences the complex network of cytokine \ninteraction that regulates the immune re sponse \n(Nielsen, 2008) , while the intake of phosphoric acid has \nbeen associated to an increase of phosphorus in the \norganisms (Caravati, 1987). Phosphorus in high \nconcentrations can promote decalcification and \ndecrease growth (Calvo  & Tucker, 2013), but it can \nimprove health in moderate concentration. In hybrid \nsturgeons, the addition of phosphorus in the diet at 0.63 \nand 1.15% activates antioxidant enzymes and promotes \neradication of free radicals (Jin et al ., 2012). In \nhomeopathic concentrations, phosphoric acid has been \nrelated to the improvement of the immune response in \nCatarina scallop (Maz\u00f3n -Su\u00e1stegui et al ., 2017 ). The \ninteraction between sodium metasilicates and phos -\nphoric acid at homeopathic dilution 1D proved to \nincrease i mmune response in A. ventricosus  juveniles, \nwhich agrees with literature. Vidatox\u00ae (Havana, Cuba) \nhas also demonstrated to increase hemocyte count. It is \na registered trademark of a commercial homeopathic \ndrug from the scorpion Rhopalurus juneceus  venoms \nand sold to treat cancer in humans (http://vidatox -\nromania.ro/en/what -is-vidatox/).  \nNonetheless, Giovannini et al. (2017) observed that \nit could induce hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation \nin culture mouse cells. Thus, it has to be handled \ncarefully because these authors used the commercial \nsolution Vidatox\u00ae, which is a hydroalcoholic solution \n(30\u00b0GL), and carcinom a proliferation could be an effect \nof the alcohol itself. It has been reported that ethanol \ncan suppress mouse macrophages, immune response \n(Watson et al ., 1988), inhibit TLR4 pathway and \ndecrease cytokines (Pruett & Fan, 2009). In order to \navoid the undes irable effects of ethanol, distilled water \nwas used as a final excipient to formulate homeopathic \ntreatments in this study. Although our results suggested \nVidatox\u00ae dynamized 1C in distilled water can activate \nthe immunomodulatory response.  \nThe increase in hemocyte count in organisms \ntreated with homeopathy formulated from pathogenic \nbacteria, sodium metasilicate -phosphoric acid, and \nVidatox\u00ae were mainly related to increases in the \nantioxidant enzymes CAT and SOD activity. The \nformer supports the idea of the  immune system \nactivation as increases of expression of antioxidant enzymes accompanied by an increase of hemocytes \nhave already been linked in the oyster Ostrea edulis  to \nimmune response activation (Prado -Alvarez et al ., \n2015). The highest SOD and CAT act ivities occurred \nas a response to overcome oxidative stress in a better \nway when organisms are subjected either to environ -\nmental factors, pollutants or pathogen infection \n(Vlahogianni et al., 2007 ; Song et al., 2010). SOD and \nCAT can transform cytotoxic c ompounds produced by \nreactive oxygen species (ROS) as superoxide and \nhydrogen peroxide, in products not harmful for the cells \nsuch as water and oxygen (Song et al., 2010). In this \nstudy, treatments from pathogenic bacteria and sodium \nmetasilicate -phosphori c acid showed a notorious \nactivation of the antioxidant system (around the 300 -\n500% of CAT activity in the mantle and about the 160% \nof SOD in digestive gland compared to controls). These \ntreatments have been associated with antioxidant \nsystem activation a t homeopathic and non -homeopathic \nsolutions. Increases of CAT and SOD in digestive gland \n(around 600 and 250%, respectively) activities have \nbeen reported as an effect of toxin exposure (Prego -\nFaraldo et al ., 2017)  and presence of bacterial \ncompounds (Song et al ., 20 10; Wang et al ., 2013) . \nParticularly CAT activity has demonstrated to \ncontribute to the redox balance in Chlamys farreri and \nMeretrix meretrix to counter -react oxidative stress \nproduced by pathogen attack (Li et al., 2008; Wang et \nal., 2013), and heat k illed pathogenic bacteria, such as \nV. splendidus  and V. anguillarum  in Mytilus \ngalloprovincialis  which registered and increase \nbetween 58 to 98% of CAT activity compared to the \ncontrol (Canesi et al ., 2010) . In mouse brain from \norganisms intoxicated with aluminum, an increase in \ntranscription of the antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT \nhave been reported when silicic acid at 0.9% was \nadministered to mice (Gonzalez -Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2008) . \nEvidence has been reported that proves the presence of \nsilicic acid in homeopathic treatments by the effect of \nsuccussion of silicon products ( Anick & Ives, 2007) . \nAlso, Maz\u00f3n -Su\u00e1stegui et al . (2017) reported an \nincrease of the 10% in SOD activi ty when A. \nventricosus  juveniles were treated with homeopathic \nphosphoric acid compared with ethanol control. These \nslight increases in SOD activity promoted a higher \nsurvival of scallops during challenge assays with Vibrio \nalginolyticus . The activation of antioxidant enzy -mes \nstrengthened organisms versus oxidative stress, which \nmay help to overcome stressful conditions as disease. \nThe results attained in this research prove that \nhomeopathic treatments, particularly those formulated \nfrom pathogenic bacteria, are capable of activating the \nimmune response at the cellular level and the antio -\nxidant system of the Catarina scallop juveniles.  74                                                           Latin American Journal of Aquatic Research  \n \n \nThe commercial homeopathic treatments from \nSilicea terra and Phosphoric acid (Similia\u00ae) did not \nshow a definite effect on the immune response, but they \nshowed clear and significant increases of energetic \nreserves in treated scallops. This treatment promoted \nthe accumulation of carbohydrates (mantle, muscle) \nand lipids (digestive gland, muscle). Carbohydrate  \nreserves in mollusk bivalves are mainly related to \nmuscle and lipid reserves to digestive gland (Maguire \net al., 1999; Darriba et al., 2005). Both tissues (muscle \nand digestive gland) have been reported as the principal \nstorage organs of energetics reserv es (Barber & Blake, \n2006) . Protein levels depletion (around 12 to 41%) in \nall experimental groups was related to overall nutrition \nconditions in the laboratory, which allowed storing \nenergetic reserves. The depletions of protein levels \nhave been associated  with an increase in other energetic \nreserves like carbohydrates and lipids (Freites et al ., \n2003) . As all treatments had the same diet, an increase \nof reserves by Silicea terra  and phosphoric acid  \n(Similia\u00ae) could be related with an enhancement in \nfood assimilation processes. Homeopathic Silicea terra  \nhas been reported as a growth promoter in A. \nventr icosus (Maz\u00f3n -Su\u00e1stegui et al., 2017). In the non -\nhomeopathic presentation, silicon dioxide at 0.02% in \nturkey diet increased growth and reduced nitrogen loss \n(Tran et al ., 2015) . Phromkunthong (2015) reported \nthat S ilica+, a micronized silica powder, increased \npeptidases accompanied with an increase in growth in \nthe shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.  In the case of \nphosphoric acid  (Similia\u00ae) homeopathic solutions are \nrecommended to improve food assimilation. More \nevaluation bet ween silica -phosporic acid and digestive \nenzyme should be done to elucidate if treatments were \nacting on enzymatic activity to promote nutrient intake \nor by other via. The accumulation of reserves by Silicea \nterra and phosphoric acid treatments may contrib ute to \nhaving organisms more resistant to stressor factors as a \ndisease caused by pathogenic bacteria may cause a \ndepletion of energy reserves (Genard et al., 2013).  \nThe DGI and SmMI did not show a specific effect \nby treatment, but StMI was higher in scall ops treated \nwith Silicea terra and phosphoric acid (Similia\u00ae) \nalthough this treatment registered the highest \ncarbohydrates content in muscle. StMI increase could \nbe a consequence of the accumulation of metabolic \nreserves, mainly carbohydrates. As discussed  above, \nSilicea terra and phosphoric acid (Similia\u00ae) treatment \nwere associated to promote better assimilation. It \nshould be noticed that muscle is one of the main \ncarbohydrates reserves in scallops and striated muscle \ncan store a higher content of carbohyd rates than smooth \nmuscle (Maguire & Burnell, 2001).  As all treatments receive the same diets and \nhatchery conditions were kept at overall conditions, \ngrowth was attributed to treatment effect. A relation -\nship was observed between growth in shell length and \nthe homeopathic treatments formulated by pathogenic \nbacteria, which was unexpected as treatments from \nSilicea  terra-phosphoric acid have shown a significant \nincrease in energetic reserves and muscular co ndition \nindex. Treatments with the higher growth rate in length \nshowed higher hemocyte count. It has been observed \nthat hemocytes contribute to wound and shell repair \n(Beninger & Le Pennec, 2006), playing an important \nrole in calcium transport to shell reg eneration (K\u00e1d\u00e1r, \n2008). Haemocytes count has been associated with \ninduction to shell repair (Mount  et al ., 2004) . This \nfinding makes us suppose that hemocytes could have \ncontributed to shell formation and could be helping to \nincrease shell calcification and growth as in condition \nindex were minimal differences between most of the \ntreatments; more studies should be  required to \ncorroborate this information.  \nCONCLUSIONS  \nIn conclusion, the homeopathic treatments, mainly \nthose formulated from pathogenic bacteria prove to \ngenerate a quantifiable biological effect, increasing \nhemocyte  count and antioxidant enzyme activity. \nHomeopathic treatments formulated by Silicea  terra-\nphosphoric acid contributed to energetic reserve \naccumulation in the principal storage tissues. \nHomeopathic treatments are a good alternative to \nactivate the immune system at the cellular level and the \nantioxidant system because of their easiness for \npreparation, storage, and administration.
