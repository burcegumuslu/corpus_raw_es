Many of those products, it said in a statement, aren\u2019t just herbal tea cures for a sore throat. They\u2019re products being marketed as treatments for serious diseases\u2014hope bottled up and sold to desperate people, without any sort of clinical evidence that they might actually work.\n\u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve seen a large uptick in products labeled as homeopathic that are being marketed for a wide array of diseases and conditions, from the common cold to cancer,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement. \u201cIn many cases, people may be placing their trust and money in therapies that may bring little to no benefit in combating serious ailments, or worse\u2013that may cause significant and even irreparable harm because the products are poorly manufactured, or contain active ingredients that aren\u2019t adequately tested or disclosed to patients.\u201d\nThis is not the first crack down of its kind to come since Gottlieb took the reigns at the FDA. In November, the\n[agency sent warning letters](https://gizmodo.com/the-fda-is-cracking-down-on-claims-that-weed-cures-canc-1820079760) to four companies claiming that marijuana-based products can treat or cure cancer. In the same month, it [also announced](https://gizmodo.com/the-fda-wants-to-bring-gene-therapies-to-market-much-fa-1820506408) it would intensify its enforcement of stem cell clinics peddling bogus, often risky therapies.\nThe FDA\u2019s Monday announcement included a draft of new guidelines intended to promote\n[risk-based enforcement](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM589373.pdf) of homeopathic remedies.\nThe guidelines outline a focus on products with reported safety concerns, those for treatment of serious diseases, products targeted at \u201cvulnerable populations\u201d and therapies that are applied topically or taken orally.\nIt\u2019s a similar approach to the\n[one proposed](https://gizmodo.com/the-fda-wants-to-bring-gene-therapies-to-market-much-fa-1820506408) to regulate stem cell clinics. It\u2019s also a good example of what the FDA commissioner called \u201c [deregulating by regulating](https://www.statnews.com/2017/11/03/fda-gottlieb-regulations/).\u201d\nThe agency notes that until recently, homeopathic remedies were a small market, but they have now ballooned into a $3 billion industry. Purveyors like Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop now get rich\n[peddling bogus medicine](https://goop.com/wellness/health/4-at-home-homeopathic-treatments/) to the public.\nHomeopathy is a specific alternative medicine practice that operates under the premise that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people can cure similar symptoms in sick people, if you dilute it to the point of being basically nonexistent. It is almost\n[undoubtedly a pseudoscience](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2010/192/8/homeopathy-what-does-best-evidence-tell-us). But in the U.S., it has been government-approved pseudoscience ever since the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 recognized homeopathic preparations as drugs. After petitions to the FDA and FTC from the [Center for Inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Inquiry), in 2015 the FDA held a hearing on homeopathic product regulation and last year the FTC announced that homeopathic products cannot include claims of effectiveness without evidence.\nThere is a 90-day public comment period for the new draft guidelines before anything is officially implemented. But it\u2019s a long-overdue step in the right direction.", "language": null, "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["//avclub.com", "//deadspin.com", "//gizmodo.com", "//jalopnik.com", "//jezebel.com", "//kotaku.com", "//qz.com", "//theroot.com", "//thetakeout.com", "//theonion.com", "//theinventory.com", "https://gizmodo.com/how-to-tip-gizmodo-1843880833", "https://store.gizmodo.com", "/newsletter", "//gizmodo.com", "//gizmodo.com", "/search", "//gizmodo.com", "//gizmodo.com/", "//gizmodo.com/latest", "https://gizmodo.com/tech", "https://gizmodo.com/reviews", "https://gizmodo.com/science", "https://gizmodo.com/earther", "https://gizmodo.com/io9", "https://gizmodo.com/tech/artificial-intelligence", "https://gizmodo.com/science/spaceflight", "https://gizmodo.com/en-espanol-1848603473?_ga=2.204873431.653264873.1666019559-515257273.1663377162", "https://gizmodo.com/top-video", null, "/science/health", "/author/kristenvbrown", "#replies", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=gizmodo&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Fthe-fda-is-cracking-down-on-homeopathic-remedies-1821403162%3Futm_medium%3Dsharefromsite%26utm_source%3Dgizmodo_twitter&text=The%20FDA%20Is%20Cracking%20Down%20on%20Homeopathic%20Remedies", "https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Fthe-fda-is-cracking-down-on-homeopathic-remedies-1821403162%3Futm_medium%3Dsharefromsite%26utm_source%3Dgizmodo_facebook", "https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Fthe-fda-is-cracking-down-on-homeopathic-remedies-1821403162%3Futm_medium%3Dsharefromsite%26utm_source%3Dgizmodo_reddit&title=The%20FDA%20Is%20Cracking%20Down%20on%20Homeopathic%20Remedies", "mailto:?subject=The%20FDA%20Is%20Cracking%20Down%20on%20Homeopathic%20Remedies&body=https%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Fthe-fda-is-cracking-down-on-homeopathic-remedies-1821403162%3Futm_medium%3Dsharefromsite%26utm_source%3Dgizmodo_email", "https://gizmodo.com/the-fda-is-cracking-down-on-homeopathic-remedies-1821403162", "https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm589243.htm", "https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074360.htm", "https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Fdid-elon-musk-regret-buying-twitter-walter-isaacson-1850842173%3Futm_medium%3Dsharefromsite%26utm_source%3Dfacebook", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Fdid-elon-musk-regret-buying-twitter-walter-isaacson-1850842173%3Futm_medium%3Dsharefromsite%26utm_source%3Dtwitter&text=Did%20Elon%20Musk%20Regret%20Buying%20Twitter%3F%20%7C%20Walter%20Isaacson%20Interview", "mailto:?subject=Did%20Elon%20Musk%20Regret%20Buying%20Twitter%3F%20%7C%20Walter%20Isaacson%20Interview&body=https%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Fdid-elon-musk-regret-buying-twitter-walter-isaacson-1850842173%3Futm_medium%3Dsharefromsite%26utm_source%3Demail", "https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Fdid-elon-musk-regret-buying-twitter-walter-isaacson-1850842173%3Futm_medium%3Dsharefromsite%26utm_source%3Dreddit&title=Did%20Elon%20Musk%20Regret%20Buying%20Twitter%3F%20%7C%20Walter%20Isaacson%20Interview", "https://gizmodo.com/did-elon-musk-regret-buying-twitter-walter-isaacson-1850842173", "https://gizmodo.com/did-elon-musk-regret-buying-twitter-walter-isaacson-1850842173", "https://gizmodo.com/did-elon-musk-regret-buying-twitter-walter-isaacson-1850842173", "https://gizmodo.com/michael-jai-white-on-directing-outlaw-johnny-black-1850839763", "https://gizmodo.com/monsters-of-california-exclusive-trailer-1850836488", "https://gizmodo.com/the-fda-is-cracking-down-on-claims-that-weed-cures-canc-1820079760", "https://gizmodo.com/the-fda-wants-to-bring-gene-therapies-to-market-much-fa-1820506408", "https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM589373.pdf", "https://gizmodo.com/the-fda-wants-to-bring-gene-therapies-to-market-much-fa-1820506408", "https://www.statnews.com/2017/11/03/fda-gottlieb-regulations/", "https://goop.com/wellness/health/4-at-home-homeopathic-treatments/", "https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2010/192/8/homeopathy-what-does-best-evidence-tell-us", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Inquiry", null]}
