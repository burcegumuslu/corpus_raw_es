It can improve work\u2013life balance, reduce traffic and time spent commuting, \nand decrease air pollution, all of which can, indirectly, improve physical and mental health. Telework \ncan also have public health and social benefits.\n \u25a0Telework settings may fail to meet the occupational safety and health standards available at traditional \nworksites.\n \u25a0Poor physical environment and workplace design and inadequate equipment and support can result \nin musculoskeletal disorders, eye strain and injuries.\n \u25a0Working within a digital environment in physical isolation from co-workers, coupled with potential \ndifficulties in managing work-private life balance in premises outside the direct control of the \nemployer, can result in mental health problems and unhealthy behaviours.\n \u25a0Protecting and promoting health and well-being in teleworking requires a comprehensive set of \nmeasures to provide a healthy and safe work environment, including adequate organization of the \nwork.\n \u25a0Governments, employers and workers all have a role in protecting and promoting health and \nsafety while teleworking, including ergonomics, mental health and well-being, as defined by the \nILO Convention on Occupational Safety and Health, 1981 and the Promotional Framework for \nOccupational Safety and Health Convention, 2006.\n \u25a0Those employing teleworkers should develop programmes to promote healthy and safe telework. \nSuch programmes should provide assistance for assessing and managing the risk factors for health \nand safety; workstation, computer and peripheral equipment, and remote ICT support. \n \u25a0Occupational health services can offer ergonomic, mental health and psychosocial support.\n \u25a0Workers should collaborate with employers on the implementation of these measures, cooperating \nwith their employer and fulfilling their own health and safety duties to ensure decent and safe \nconditions for telework.1\nOverview\nDefinition of telework\nTelework is defined as the use of information and communications technology (ICT) \u2013 such as desktop \ncomputers, laptops, tablets and smartphones \u2013 for work that is performed outside the employer\u2019s \npremises. This includes work performed from home, a satellite office or another location (1). \u201cHybrid\u201d \nwork refers to a combination of telework and work on the employer\u2019s premises. Several different \ndefinitions and terms are used to describe telework (e.g. remote work and e-work); however, the \nunifying characteristics of telework, as outlined by the International Labour Organization (ILO) technical \nnote COVID-19: Guidance for labour statistics data collection: Defining and measuring remote work, \ntelework, work at home and home-based work  (2) (), include work that is fully or partly carried out at \na location other than the default place of work, and the use of electronic devices such as a computer, \ntablet or telephone to perform work. Telework affects the degree of control that the employer has \nover the working environment, and the employer\u2019s ability to plan and provide for a healthy and safe \nwork environment.\nPrevalence of telework\nThe public health and social measures introduced because of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in \nan unprecedented and rapid transition to telework in many sectors and regions around the world. In \nEurope, for example, the proportion of workers engaged in telework increased from 11% before the \npandemic to 48% during it, with about 40% of paid workhours during the COVID-19 pandemic taking \nplace by telework (3, 4). In the region of Latin America and the Caribbean, more than 23 million people \ntransitioned to telework in the second quarter of 2020 (5). Globally, most of the transition to telework \noccurred among workers with higher income and education levels. A recent analysis suggests that the \nuse of telework may continue to grow; for example, research conducted during 2020 indicates that \n34% of jobs in the United States of America (USA) could plausibly be performed remotely (6). As the use \nof telework is likely to increase, it is important to ensure that employers, governments and workers and \ntheir representatives understand how to address the potential health impacts of telework in a manner \nthat balances the needs of workers and organizations. \nAbout this document\nThe aim of this document is to provide technical information to employers, teleworkers and worker \nrepresentatives about the impact of telework on health, safety and well-being. It provides practical \nadvice on organizing and carrying out telework in a way that protects and promotes physical and mental \nhealth and social well-being, according to the existing World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines \nand ILO standards and guides. 2\nHealthy and safe telework\nThis document addresses the following questions:\n \u25a0What are the impacts of telework on the physical and mental health and social well-being of workers \nand their families?\n \u25a0How can employers and workers organize and carry out teleworking in a healthy and safe manner? \n \u25a0What are the roles and responsibilities of employers in protecting workers\u2019 health and safety, and \nproviding a supportive environment for telework?\n \u25a0What are the roles and responsibilities of workers and their representatives in protecting and \npromoting health and safety while teleworking?\n \u25a0How can occupational health services and primary health care providers support the health and \nsafety of teleworkers?\nThe methods used for the development of this documents are provided in the Annex. \nThis document was developed based on rapid review of evidence about health impacts of telework, \nscoping of existing relevant WHO guidelines and ILO norms and standards regarding occupational safety \nand health, health behaviours and working environment. \n3\nHealth impact of telework\nPhysical health outcomes\nThere is extensive evidence on the impact of prolonged computer work on a number of physical ailments \n(e.g. musculoskeletal damage and eye strain) in office settings, but few studies have specifically assessed \nthe impact of telework. The research that has been undertaken on telework has shown both positive \nand negative impacts on physical health. \nA review of studies reported that home-based telework is generally seen by workers as having a \npositive effect on their self-reported health, but can lead to problems arising from workstation design \nand long working hours (7). Two studies reported reductions in blood pressure with teleworking: a \nquestionnaire-based study of academic personnel found that teleworkers had fewer complaints about \narterial hypertension (8), and a study of Swedish government workers showed blood pressure to be \nsignificantly higher during work at the office than during telework at home (9). While the telework has \nmost recently been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent the spread of the virus, it has been \nalso found that some teleworkers have also struggled to continue to work when they are sick, which \nhas been termed sickness presenteeism (10).\nThese studies are preliminary; more research will be needed to determine the true impacts of telework \nfor different workers and over longer periods of time.\nMental health outcomes\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, telework was often based on individual agreements between a \nworker and employer (e.g. to better address work\u2013life balance). However, in response to the COVID-19 \npandemic, telework has in some cases been imposed on workers and employers as part of public health \nand social measures, resulting in a potential mismatch with workers\u2019 preferences.\nSeveral research studies undertaken before the COVID-19 pandemic indicated that telework may reduce \nwork-related stress (11\u201314) ; however, other studies reported increased stress with telework (15\u201317) .\nFive studies (including one review) undertaken either before or during the COVID-19 pandemic reported \nsocial isolation as a potential adverse health effect associated with telework (7, 15, 18\u201320) . Another study \nreported a higher incidence of loneliness, irritability, worry and guilt among teleworkers (21). Conversely, a \ncohort study analysing employee demographic data, medical claims, health risk assessments and remote \nconnectivity hours reported a reduced risk for depression among those who teleworked compared with \nthose who did not telework (22).\nResearch conducted in the USA during the COVID-19 pandemic reported that participants working \nfrom home spent more quality time with pets and family members, although working from the office \nprovided more opportunities to socialize and led to less conflict between work and family (19). A Spanish \nstudy conducted during COVID-19 home confinement demonstrated that not teleworking contributed \nto a better occupational balance, a balance of engagement in occupation that leads to well-being (23). 4\nHealthy and safe telework\nA review of studies found that telework was associated with more conflict between work and family \nthan traditional 9 to 5 schedules, and that such conflict was higher when work demands were high (24).\nA study conducted in Japan at a time when telework was expanding because of the COVID-19 epidemic \nreported that, as the frequency of telework increased, workers who preferred to telework experienced \nless psychological distress than those who preferred not to telework (25). This suggests that worker \npreference affects the potential mental health impact of telework. \nHealth behaviours \nA study of employee demographic data, medical claims, health risk assessments and remote connectivity \nhours showed a relationship between telework and lower health risks for alcohol abuse, tobacco use \nand obesity, with the relationship varying by telework intensity (22). The study also showed greater \nlevels of physical activity among teleworking employees compared with non-teleworkers (22). Increased \nphysical activity has also been observed among teleworkers. A survey-based study found that telework \nwas associated with 71% higher odds of achieving 30 minutes or more of physical activity per day when \ncompared with non-telework workdays (26). A study of employees who began teleworking because of \nCOVID-19 found a significant increase in the frequency of physical activity carried out during this period \nand a change in the type of activity, with a preference for strength training and stretching exercises \n(27). A study of adults in the USA showed that those who worked from home spent more time on food \npreparation or consumption than those who worked away from home (28). The findings suggest that \nworking from home may provide more time to prepare and consume food, possibly yielding health \nbenefits because home-prepared meals tend to be lower in calories and higher in nutrients than food \nbought in or around the workplace.5\nProtecting and promoting health, safety and well-being \nwhile teleworking\n1 This is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system. It applies theory, principles, data and methods to the design of \nwork to optimize human well-being and overall systems performance.Physical environment and ergonomics\nWhen workers engage in telework, they may face increased risks in relation to the physical environment \nand ergonomics (referred to as human factors/ergonomics1) because home settings often do not meet \nthe same occupational safety and health standards as traditional worksites. The physical environment \nmay present risks related to factors such as thermal discomfort from inadequate heating and cooling \nsystems, lighting, electrical safety, home hygiene and air quality. Creating a good ergonomic environment \nfor computer workers by providing an ergonomic chair, a large screen, a keyboard and mouse, adjustable \nor flexible workstations and training can minimize musculoskeletal and eye discomfort, promote healthy \ncomputing behaviours and improve performance (29, 30) . \nInsufficient or inadequate set-up of the equipment available to the worker (e.g. ICT equipment, desk, \nchair and internet connection) can present health and safety risks (31). A poorly positioned set-up of \ncomputer, chair and desk may result in musculoskeletal injuries such as neck or lower back pain and eye \nstrain; it can also create mental health risks if it contributes to stress. Commensurate with their degree \nof control, employers should ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable, the telework office space \nmeets ergonomics standards. Interventions such as ergonomic tele-site risk assessments, worker training, \nheight-adjustable workstation furniture and proper set-up of office equipment are recommended to \nprevent injury during telework (32), in particular where telework is performed on a regular basis. \nThe following action points may be considered while setting up a telework station. They are especially \nrelevant for those undertaking long-term, regular telework:\n \u25a0Teleworkers should have a dedicated workspace that is private, quiet and secure. A workstation \n\u201ccomfort zone\u201d can be created by arranging the computer monitor and input devices so that they are \nclose to the person\u2019s body, allowing a relaxed and comfortable posture, and reducing overstretching \nand awkward, non-neutral postures. Work surfaces should accommodate at minimum a stand-alone \ncomputer or laptop with a docking station and detachable keyboard.\n \u25a0A well-designed ergonomic office chair is a critical component of the teleworker\u2019s home office. \nIf used for full-time office and computer work, common household chairs can eventually create \nproblems because of the lack of adjustments and support. It is important to select a chair with height \nadjustability, back-tilt mechanism, lumbar support, adjustable arm rests and a seat pan that has an \nappropriate width and length, so it fits the worker and supports their body. 6\nHealthy and safe telework\nErgonomic checkpoints, published by the ILO and \nInternational Ergonomics Association, provides practical \nsolutions for improving safety, health and working conditions \nfrom an ergonomic point of view (33). \nThe ILO has also developed an Ergonomics checkpoints \napplication (for both iOS and Android) that helps users to \ncreate interactive checklists of ergonomic checkpoints \nfor their own workplaces. The app includes best practice \nrecommendations for taking action and implementing \neffective improvements in ergonomics in the workplace (34). \n \u25a0When setting up a computer workstation layout, the work \nsurface should be large enough to ensure the proper \nplacement of the monitor, keyboard and mouse, along with a document holder. When using a laptop, \nit is worth considering an external keyboard and monitor to allow for the monitor to be at the proper \nheight for viewing, to reduce neck strain. Employers, through occupational health services, should \nprovide workers with assistance in setting up the teleworking station.\n \u25a0While typing or mousing, the worker should keep their wrists in a straight, nonrigid position, and avoid \npositioning the wrists at an exaggerated angle or in a position that causes tension in the wrists. A palm \nrest (sometimes called a wrist rest) can provide support during pauses but is not designed to be used \nduring typing or moving the mouse. The hands and the wrists should be free to move when typing \nand should not be anchored or resting on a palm rest, table or thighs while typing. The fingers should \nbe relaxed and nonrigid when operating a laptop or an input device, to reduce strain to the finger \njoints. Resting the palms while typing may be harmful because it can cause the person to bend and \nhold their wrists and fingers back, or it can apply pressure to the underside of the wrists. \n \u25a0If a smartphone or tablet is used, its height should be raised to eye level or slightly below (e.g. by \nplacing the device on a stack of books or magazines). An external ergonomic keyboard should be \nused if a worker needs to type text into a smartphone or tablet for a long time (35).\n \u25a0Visual strain and eye fatigue can be reduced by positioning the monitor to eliminate glare (window \nblinds and overhead baffles can be used to redirect the source of any glare). To reduce eye strain \nfrom fixation on the screen, teleworkers should be encouraged to regularly focus on far objects and \nthen rest the eyes (36).\n \u25a0Risks of slips, trips and falls should be reduced by managing cables and placing them away from any \nwalking areas, and by keeping the workspace organized and tidy. Electrical equipment should be \nmaintained to avoid risks of fire and electrocution. \n \u25a0Air circulation, ventilation and temperature should be adequate to maintain the worker\u2019s normal level \nof job performance and safety in the home environment. \n \u25a0Ambient noise level should be kept as low as possible and the use of safe listing devices through \nearphones and headphones should be encouraged (37).\nErgonomic checkpoints , \npublished by the ILO and \nInternational Ergonomics \nAssociation, provides practical solutions for improving \nsafety, health and working conditions from an \nergonomic point of view (33) . \nThe ILO has also developed an Ergonomics \ncheckpoints  application (for both iOS and Android) \nthat helps users to create interactive checklists of \nergonomic checkpoints for their own workplaces. \nThe app includes best practice recommendations \nfor taking action and implementing effective \nimprovements in ergonomics in the workplace (34) . 7\n Technical brief\n \u25a0Varying computing postures and taking regular stretch breaks will reduce the impact of sedentary \nworkstyles, prolonged sitting, and the static loads (i.e. stress caused by sitting or standing in one place \nfor a prolonged period) and fatigue associated with computer work. If possible, teleworkers should \nbe able to move through a variety of sitting and standing postures to promote healthy work habits \nand to reduce musculoskeletal and visual discomforts. Workers should be encouraged to change \npostures and take short breaks throughout the day to move. There are benefits to incorporating \nstanding positions throughout the workday while computing; however, it is essential to be trained on \nhow to properly adjust and use sit\u2013stand workstations to avoid musculoskeletal and eye symptoms (30).\n \u25a0Integrating routine breaks into the teleworker\u2019s daily work regimen and providing ergonomic reminders \nvia wearable technology or software programmes that encourage and promote physical activity may \nbe helpful in keeping workers healthy.\nIt is useful that teleworkers receive training on the recommended strategies (i.e. how to optimally set up \nand adjust a workstation to obtain various comfortable computing postures, and how to adopt healthy \ncomputer work habits and vary postures throughout working hours). This training can be supported by \na tele-ergonomics evaluation and surveillance system that monitors ergonomic assessments, training \nand implementation of corrective actions. Online resources and training on how to manage boundaries \naround work\u2013life balance and simultaneous demands from work and family will help workers to gain a \nbetter sense of control and reduce stress, and will improve work performance. \nPsychosocial risk factors\nWhen organized and carried out properly, telework can be beneficial for mental health and social \nwell-being. It can improve work\u2013life balance, reduce time spent on commuting to the workplace, and \noffer opportunities for flexible work arrangements, all of which may promote mental health and social \nwellbeing. \nTelework may present risks for psychosocial well-being, including impact on work pace, longer working \nhours, interference with work\u2013life balance, isolation and detachment. There might also be a risk of \nviolence and harassment, including cyberbullying. The psychosocial impact on the worker and their \nfamily may be compounded in situations when the worker does not have access to a private, quiet and \ndedicated workstation.\nCommunication can be challenging during telework, because it is limited to ICT channels with little \nor no face-to-face communication and can be limited by the bandwidth of the internet connection. \nDifficulties related to communication may make it difficult for workers to understand the task at hand, \nresulting in stress. Some workers may feel the effects of social or professional isolation, owing to \ndecreased communication with their colleagues and management. Studies have shown the importance \nof using open communication that emphasizes the sharing of information (38) and communicating with \nmotivating language (39) in promoting worker well-being during telework. \nWhile teleworking, workers may experience sometimes working long hours or late into the night. If \nthe set work times are not well established between workers and their managers, resulting in difficulty \ndisconnecting from work and managing the work schedule.). This is exacerbated when a company works \nacross multiple time zones. Employees working from home tend to work longer hours than when they \nare working at the premises of the employer, in part because the time to commute to the workplace 8\nHealthy and safe telework\nis replaced by work activities, and also because of changes in work routines and the blurring of the \nboundaries between paid work and personal life (1).\nBecause telework relies heavily on ICT and internet usage, cyberbullying can pose risks to workers. \nCyberbullying may occur among colleagues, among supervisors and subordinates, and among workers \nand clients or the public. Experiencing cyberbullying may affect workers\u2019 mental health. To protect \nworkers from these potential threats, employers should consider establishing a workplace policy covering \ncyberbullying, in consultation with workers or their representatives. \nWhile teleworking from home, tension among family members or housemates may increase the risk that \na worker experiences domestic violence and harassment. Employers can help raise awareness among \nworkers about the signs and effects of domestic violence, and provide information about relevant \nresources and support for victims. \nThe following action points may be considered to encourage social interactions and promote mental \nhealth during telework:\n \u25a0Employers should encourage workers to set boundaries on workhours and keep to a regular schedule, \nto ensure they do not to work an excessive number of hours. Timers and hour logs can help workers \ntrack their hours and stay within a healthy work schedule, but such tools must be confidential, and \nworkers should not feel they are being monitored or are under constant surveillance. \n \u25a0Employers should avoid contacting workers outside of scheduled workhours, and should encourage \nco-workers and managers to communicate only during scheduled workhours.\n \u25a0Regular social interactions during telework (e.g. virtual meetups and dedicated social time before \nand after meetings) may decrease the sense of isolation and detachment during telework. Workers \nshould be encouraged to connect with co-workers for virtual gatherings and informal chats. \n \u25a0Employers should provide teleworkers with ICT tools and software that will help them to connect \nefficiently with co-workers and managers. Regular communication with managers and peers about \ncurrent happenings, sharing of information and problem-solving ideas, and discussing performance-\nrelated issues can reduce psychosocial strain. However, it is important for employers and managers \nto be aware of the number of online meetings employees are involved in, especially the number of \nback-to-back meetings.\n \u25a0Workers should be encouraged to engage in enjoyable social and recreational activities during work \nbreaks. This could include short physical activity breaks. \n \u25a0Workers should be informed about the potential psychosocial risks related to telework, the early \nsymptoms of mental ill health, and how and where they can access psychosocial and mental health \nsupports. \n \u25a0Teleworkers should be trained on appropriate work behaviour and digital etiquette while interacting \nwith colleagues, and on how to identify and respond to abuse or bullying.9\n Technical brief\nHealth behaviours and well-being\nWork can have an important role in promoting health and well-being among workers through diet, \nphysical activity and a healthy work\u2013life balance (40). Telework presents unique challenges and \nopportunities for promoting health and well-being. When telework is carried out in private homes and \nother premises outside the direct control of the employer, it may be difficult to enforce the established \nworkplace policies on tobacco smoking, use of alcohol and drugs. Work\u2013life balance may be affected as \nworkers are faced with family duties, especially if young children or other family members are at home \nduring working hours. Respecting boundaries between work and personal time can reduce psychosocial \nstressors and enhance worker performance. \nFor many adults, the workplace is a key setting for being physically active and reducing sedentary \nbehaviour. The trip to and from work, activity breaks, workplace programmes and incidental activity all \noffer opportunities for increased physical activity throughout the workday (41).\nEmployers can support teleworker well-being through encouraging healthy routines and providing \ntraining and resources for maintaining healthy behaviours while teleworking (42). The following action \npoints may be considered to promote healthy behaviours and well-being during telework:\n \u25a0Employers can encourage and enable teleworkers to define boundaries for work and personal time, to \nensure that they maintain a routine of work- and nonwork-related activities and a time-management \nschedule. Employers can promote the opportunity for workers to have flexibility and control of their \nschedules, to manage the competing demands of work and family tasks.\n \u25a0Excess screen time and irregular workhours during telework can have a detrimental effect on sleep \npatterns. Workers should maintain a regular sleep schedule and refrain from screen time and work \nduties before sleep. Electronic devices can be set to have reminders for the worker to turn off the \ndevice before sleep. \n \u25a0Workers and employers should work together to develop and implement telework arrangements that \nallow workers time to rest, recuperate, and address personal activities.\n \u25a0WHO recommends that all adults should undertake 150\u2013300 minutes of moderate-intensity or \n75\u2013150 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate-\nintensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week (43). Although this may be challenging \nduring periods of telework because of the long hours of sedentary work, the worker\u2019s routine can \nbe set up to include times for physical activity; for example, by scheduling a recreational physical \nactivity, fitness class or walk. \n \u25a0WHO recommends that workplaces be designed to enable people with diverse abilities to be physically \nactive (44). Thus, for telework, employers should encourage physical activity in accordance with the \nworker\u2019s ability. \n \u25a0Maintaining a healthy diet that balances energy intake and expenditure, and limits intake of free \nsugars to 10% of energy intake and total fat to less than 30% of total energy intake is important for \nmaintaining health. Workers can be educated about healthy food options from reliable sources such \nas WHO\u2019s 5 keys to a healthy diet (45). To maintain a healthy diet while teleworking, it can be helpful 10\nHealthy and safe telework\nto plan regular meals and snacks, avoid snacking while working or distracted, drink sufficient water \nand avoid processed food and drinks with added sugar. \n \u25a0WHO and the ILO recommend that all workplaces should be free from tobacco smoke (46, 47) . \nEmployers can convey to teleworkers that they are expected to abide by smoke-free workplace \npolicies while teleworking, encourage workers to maintain smoke-free homes and provide support \nfor smoking cessation programmes. \n \u25a0Employers can also remind those working at home that during working hours they are expected to \ncomply with the workplace drug and alcohol policies. It may be helpful to include such information in a \nremote work agreement or work-from-home policy, in accordance with the ILO\u2019s code of practice (48).\n \u25a0All health information should be accessible, understandable and realistic, taking into consideration \nlanguage and cultural appropriateness.11\nRoles and responsibilities of employers, workers and \ngovernments\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Convention, 181 (No 155) (49) and its accompanying Recommendation \n(No. 164) (50) describe the responsibilities and rights of employers and workers, and the role of \ngovernments to ensure the right to safe and healthy working environments.\nAt the national level, these standards define the obligation of ratifying Member States to formulate, \nimplement and periodically review \u2013 in consultation with the most representative organizations of \nemployers and workers \u2013 a national policy on occupational safety and health that defines the functions \nand responsibilities of public authorities, employers, workers and others. This policy should apply to \nall work circumstances, including telework, taking account of its special characteristics. According \nto the Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health Convention, 2006 (No 187) \n(51), countries should also establish a national system (Article 4) providing the main framework for \nimplementing the national policy, and a programme defining a time frame, priorities and means of \naction for the improvement (Article 5). At the workplace level, according to the Occupational Safety \nand Health Convention (49), employers should ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable, workplaces, \nmachinery, equipment and processes under their control are safe and without risk to health (Article  16). \nIn performing their work, workers should cooperate in fulfilling the obligation placed upon the \nemployer (Article 19, a). There should also be arrangements for cooperation between employers and \nrepresentatives of workers; namely, providing information and consulting workers\u2019 representatives on \nall matters related to occupational safety and health. Cooperation between management and workers \nor their representatives is essential for the success of any approach to secure the health of teleworkers. \nThe definition of a workplace in the Occupational Safety and Health Convention (49) includes \u201call places \nwhere workers need to be or to go by reason of their work and which are under the direct or indirect \ncontrol of the employer\u201d (Article 3, c) and defines health in relation to work as \u201cnot merely the absence \nof disease or infirmity; it also includes the physical and mental elements affecting health which are \ndirectly related to safety and hygiene at work\u201d (Article 3, e).\nSound management systems for occupational safety and health at the enterprise level contribute \nto safe and healthy working environments, with occupational risks addressed using the hierarchy of \ncontrols as they apply to telework: elimination, substitution, engineering controls, and administrative \ncontrols (52). Figure 1 outlines potential interventions of occupational hazards of telework according \nto the hierarchy of controls. Occupational risk management, including in relation to telework, should \nhappen in consultation with workers and workers\u2019 representatives; namely, through safety and health \ncommittees or safety delegates where they exist. Workers should also be able to communicate with \neach other and with their representatives over safety and health issues while teleworking.\nOrganizations and managers can have a positive role in designing telework that promotes worker well-\nbeing (53). To reduce the risks associated with the physical environment and ergonomics, employers \nshould ensure that workers receive adequate equipment to complete the tasks of the job. For workers \nwith physical disability, provision of equipment, tools and training to modify the telework environment \nshould be planned in consultation with the workers and their representatives, in line with the ILO Code \nof Practice on Managing Disability in the Workplace  (54) (). 12\nHealthy and safe telework\nEmployers should provide information and recommendations, along with training on how to adjust the \nphysical environment and how best to place (arrange) the computer and office equipment to reduce such \nrisks (33). Employers should also emphasize the importance of varying work tasks periodically, changing \ncomputing positions (including standing) and taking regular breaks to move and stretch.\nTelework presents some unique challenges in managing remote workers; thus, managers should be \ntrained in effective risk management, distance leadership and workplace health promotion. This training \nshould cover how to mitigate risk and respond to workers\u2019 health and safety issues (29). Employers should \nprovide clear direction on maintaining confidential company information, enable security measures for \nworkers working from home, and establish telework policies and procedures to support working from \nhome (e.g., purchasing of equipment, technology including software, office furniture and supplies). ICT \nsupport and services (e.g., for telephone, internet and equipment) should be provided, and teleworkers \nshould be informed of this. Legal issues regarding equipment and maintenance contracts and insurance \n(e.g., workers\u2019 compensation, homeowners\u2019 insurance and disability insurance) may need to be discussed \nand formalized as organizational policies. \nEmployers should communicate clearly about tasks, responsibilities, decision-making authority, \nautonomy and results to be achieved, adjusting workload and work assignments where necessary (55). \nThere should also be an understanding between workers and employers regarding hours of being in \ncontact, while adhering to applicable working-time regulations. When possible, allowing flexibility \nregarding working-time arrangements can help workers to balance their responsibilities. Employers \nshould encourage workers to incorporate relaxation exercises, stretching or physical activity into breaks \nduring meetings and during the workday. They should also provide workers with advice about creating \na dedicated, disruption-free workspace, and establishing boundaries with others in their household (56). \nTeleworkers must be provided with regular working hours and rest periods. International and national \nnorms concerning regular working hours and rest periods should also be considered when setting up \ntelework policies and arrangements. Working time should be as flexible as possible. The Hours of Work \n(Commerce and Offices) Convention, 1930 (No 30) (57) established daily and weekly working hour limits Fig. 1: Hierarchy of controls of occupational hazards in telework\nAdministrative  \ncontrolsEngineering controlsElimination/substitution \u2022 Incorporate \u201chybrid\u201d models\n\u2022 Ergonomic interventions: workstation, chair, keyboard\n\u2022 Software to manage work schedule \n\u2022 ICT and connectivity support\n\u2022 Institute policies on telework\n\u2022 Worker training\n\u2022 Practice regular short breaks\n\u2022 Health behaviour counselling\n\u2022 Social interactions with coworkers13\n Technical brief\nfor commercial and office workers (i.e. 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week), which could be applicable \nto teleworkers. The Weekly Rest (Commerce and Offices) Convention, 1957 (No 106) (58) provides for \nan uninterrupted weekly rest period comprising not less than 24 hours in the course of each period of \n7 days, which may also apply to teleworkers.\nThe European Union Framework Agreement on Telework \n(2002) (59) established a general framework on the rules \nregarding telework; the aim was to promote such work while \nensuring that it met the needs of workers and employers. \nThe agreement highlights that teleworkers retain the same \nlegal protections as employees who work at an employer\u2019s \nworkplace. It also identifies features that are specific to \nremote working and require adaptation (e.g., employment \nconditions, data protection, privacy, equipment, health and \nsafety, organization of work, training and collective rights). \nThe pressure that teleworkers often feel pressured to be \nconstantly \u201cconnected\u201d to their employer and co-workers can \nlead to many of the negative consequences of telework (e.g. \nlonger working hours and tension in balancing paid work and personal life commitments). Hence, in \nsome countries \u201cthe right to disconnect\u201d has been established, meaning that the worker has the right \nto disengage from work and refrain from engaging in work-related electronic communications (e.g. \nemails and text messages) during non-workhours. In other countries, existing working time regulations \ndeal with all relevant working time issues in general terms, and no additional laws have been introduced. \nIn many countries where the right to disconnect has been established, the right to disconnect is meant \nfor all workers, including office workers (who may be reached outside of office hours) and teleworkers. \nThe right to disconnect can be also viewed as a way to limit working hours and ensure workers can get \nproper rest between work days.\nTherefore, it is important to organize telework to meet the needs of both workers and the organization; \nthis requires a focus on outputs or outcomes rather than process., the emphasis is placed on setting up \nand agreeing the time frames and output required. Employers should refrain from excessive monitoring \nor surveillance of workers, including the inappropriate use of software that monitors computer usage \nor activates constant online video capabilities. Such measures reduce trust and may increase stress for \nteleworkers.\nThe process of organizing telework should include (31):\n \u25a0the worker and manager or employer discussing and developing an individual teleworking workplan \nfor telework, and clarifying priorities; \n \u25a0agreeing on a common system to signal availability for work and ensuring that managers and \ncolleagues respect the system;\n \u25a0encouraging workers to share when they are feeling overloaded, to serve as an early warning system \nto detect the risk of burnout, and know when tasks or team members should be reassigned;\nThe European Union \nFramework Agreement \non Telework (2002) (59)  \nestablished a general \nframework on the rules regarding telework; the aim \nwas to promote such work while ensuring that it met \nthe needs of workers and employers. The agreement \nhighlights that teleworkers retain the same legal \nprotections as employees who work at an employer\u2019s \nworkplace. It also identifies features that are specific \nto remote working and require adaptation (e.g., \nemployment conditions, data protection, privacy, \nequipment, health and safety, organization of work, \ntraining and collective rights). 14\nHealthy and safe telework\n \u25a0conducting a skills-mapping exercise among the workers, to potentially redeploy underused workers \nto overstretched teams;\n \u25a0being clear about the expected results;\n \u25a0ensuring that both workers and managers understand when a task is completed satisfactorily, with \nthe provision of positive feedback, when possible; and \n \u25a0ensuring timely, regular and constructive feedback to workers, by describing what the workers did, \nand focusing on changes that will result in the most significant improvement to the task and will have \nthe expected impact.\n15\nRoles of occupational health services \nOccupational health practitioners (e.g. occupational medicine physicians, nurses, psychologists, \nergonomists and ancillary staff) have an important role in the identification and mitigation of health \nrisks among teleworkers. To meet the changing needs of a workforce moving to telework, occupational \nhealth services \u2013 as defined by the Occupational Health Services Convention, 1985 (No 161) (60) \u2013need \nto expand their delivery channels. New channels could include online consultations, mobile applications \nand online checklists to conduct risk assessments, online evaluation of worker health, digital tools for \nmental health and psychosocial support, and tele-ergonomic assessments and interventions. Workers\u2019 \nrepresentatives are important in selecting and arranging for effective services with such professionals, \nincluding giving workers information on how to access their advice and services.\nTeleworkers should be educated by occupational health staff, national health and safety authorities, or \nother appropriate persons on the potential risks to physical and mental health and well-being before \nteleworking is introduced. Referral to ergonomic assessment should be carried out and measures taken \nto optimize the workplace according to the tasks and the worker. Occupational health services should \ninclude either onsite or remote ergonomic risk assessment, and access to occupational and physical \ntherapy services to treat occupational musculoskeletal injuries and eye strain. \nOccupational health practitioners should assess teleworkers by identifying characteristics that can be \nused to identify early signs and symptoms of health outcomes. Occupational health practitioners should \ninquire about workplace mental health stressors (e.g., low autonomy, high or low demands, harassment \nby managers or colleagues, and bullying) and non-workplace mental health stressors (e.g., work\u2013life \nimbalance, demands from child or elder care, and domestic violence). Regular screening of teleworkers \nfor mental health outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms, isolation, burnout and anxiety) through mobile \napps and online surveys should also be considered. \nThe reporting of occupational illness and injury by occupational health practitioners to the relevant \nhealth authorities is an important way to track the incidence of occupational health outcomes and \nmonitor the efficacy of workplace interventions. Illnesses and injuries, arising out of or during the course \nof telework, may be less likely to be reported as occupational diseases and accidents (7). Occupational \nhealth practitioners should assess the work-relatedness of injuries and illnesses among teleworkers and \nshould report cases to occupational health registries while ensuring confidentiality for workers. 16\nConclusion\nWhen properly organized and supported, telework may have positive impacts on workers\u2019 physical and \nmental health and social well-being. However, when the health and safety risks of teleworking are not \nprevented and workers cannot make healthy choices while teleworking, such work can have significant \nnegative impacts on health. The general principles embedded in the Occupational Safety and Health \nConvention (49) \u2013 that is, the need to assess and manage risks, and the hierarchy of controls \u2013 should \napply to telework.\nCurrent trends suggest that telework will continue to grow as an integral part of the world of work. \nBy mitigating physical and mental health risk factors, and promoting safe, healthy behaviours and well-\nbeing, we can protect all workers, regardless of where they conduct their work. \n17\nReferences\n1.

Databases queried included PubMed, \nScopus and Google Scholar for the following search terms: \u201ctelecommute*\u201d or \u201ctelework*\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d, \n\u201cwellness\u201d, \u201cwellbeing\u201d, \u201cburnout\u201d, \u201cergonomic\u201d, \u201cpsychosocial effect\u201d, \u201cstress\u201d, \u201cmuscular skeletal \nstrain\u201d, \u201cmusculoskeletal disorder\u201d, \u201cphysical activity\u201d, \u201cergonom*\u201d, \u201cdiet\u201d, \u201csocial interaction\u201d, \u201canxiety\u201d, \n\u201cdepression\u201d, \u201cmood\u201d, \u201cinsomnia\u201d, \u201cexhaustion\u201d, \u201cfatigue\u201d or \u201cisolation\u201d. A total of 127 articles were \nscreened for relevance. Articles without exposure to telework (as defined in Section 1.1) or a measured \nhealth outcome or health risk were excluded from the review. After screening, 47 articles were included \nin the review. \nThe overall quality of the literature is limited by the retrospective and qualitative nature of the data \nand the small sample size, which limits statistical significance and introduces bias and misclassification. \nMost studies are from high-income countries and primarily assess office-based work environments; \nthis limits the external validity and relevance to most of the world\u2019s workers. The geographically narrow \ndistribution of the literature was also noted in previous reviews of the scientific literature, with 34 of \n38 articles published on telework and ergonomics conducted in high-income countries.\nThe review of the literature was not intended to make evidence-based recommendations, but to explore \nthe available evidence on the impact of telework on worker health and well-being.\nDevelopment of technical content\nThe content was developed through: \n1. Reviewing of existing evidence of health impacts of telework.\n2. Reviewing existing WHO guidelines and ILO standards relevant to healthy and safe telework.\n3. Reviewing guidance and tools published by inter-governmental agencies and relevant \nprofessional associations, such as European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, International \nErgonomic Association, International Society of Occupational Medicine.\n4. Writing first draft and peer review by external subject matter experts.\n5. Inviting relevant stakeholders to submit comments on the final draft.\nAll external experts and reviewers provided declaration of interests and no competing interests were \nidentified. No commercial entities were involved in the content development.
