Targeting neurotransmitters, Zen Theanine\u2122 harnesses the power of L-theanine to help you achieve what is called \u201calert calmness.\u201d\nThe amino acid L-theanine is not only a well-known dietary supplement, but also a food additive used in Japan to give foods and beverages a savory flavor. L-theanine supports alpha-wave brain activity, which is associated with the relaxed and peaceful alertness that is experienced during meditation and it rapidly enters the system when ingested (within roughly 40 minutes).\nL-theanine promotes mental focus along with a feeling of relaxation plus alertness because it has a chemical structure very similar to glutamate, an amino acid that occurs naturally in the body and helps transmit impulses in the brain. L-theanine appears to modulate the motor stimulation associated with caffeine as well as inhibit some of the actions of the stress hormone norepinephrine in the central nervous system.\nAOR Advantage\nZen Theanine\u2122 provides naturally sourced L-theanine in an optimal dose backed by clinical research. It offers an ideal option for those suffering from stress or feelings of anxiousness, especially when those feelings compromise the ability to work, study or sleep.\nZen Theanine\u2122 is L-theanine, a unique amino acid associated with promoting calm and relaxed alertness.*\nAOR\u2122 guarantees that all ingredients have been declared on the label.
