But sometimes, the immune system doesn\u2019t function properly, allowing conditions to worsen, and sometimes the immune system malfunctions and attack a person\u2019s own body.\nIn these cases, immunotherapy can help harness the power of your own immune system, acting as the armor, support and weapons it needs to fight invading diseases or to shut down improper \u2018self\u2019 attacks.\nFrom fighting cancer to chronic diseases and even allergies, immunotherapy offers many ways to positively impact patients\u2019 lives. Put simply, immunotherapy gives immune cells the reinforcements they need to do their job.\nImmunotherapy is considered the next frontier for precision medicine, and has received national press attention \u2014 most notably in The New York Times articles below.\n[Harnessing the Immune System to Fight Cancer](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/health/harnessing-the-immune-system-to-fight-cancer.html) [Immunotherapy Offers Hope to a Cancer Patient, but no Certainty](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/01/health/immunotherapy-offers-hope-to-a-cancer-patient-but-no-certainty.html?hpw&rref=health&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region\u00aeion=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well) [Setting the Body\u2019s \u2018Serial Killers\u2019 Loose on Cancer](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/health/cancer-cell-therapy-immune-system.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region\u00aeion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news)\nBaylor Scott & White Research Institute is carrying out collaborative research projects with new immunotherapy approaches\n[research](https://www.bswhealth.com/research/) to determine the effectiveness of these potential treatments.\nHow Does Immunotherapy Work?\nImmunotherapy works in many different ways for many different types of diseases. In most cases, immunotherapy targets something that is unique about the disease to combat it.\nImmunological treatment approaches are not only much more targeted than conventional therapies, but they may also offer longer-term protection, fewer side effects and treatment opportunities for many different types of cancer and other diseases.\nHere are a few scenarios being tested:\nImmune Cell Stimulation and Suppression\nThis approach can be used to activate the immune system by injecting special molecules that cause immune cells specific to an infection or disease to multiply and attack the invading disease. In the case of allergies, immunotherapy can be used to shut down or reduce the abnormal immune response to allergens but expanding the disease-specific immune cells that would normally suppress the body\u2019s immune reaction after it is no longer needed.\nVaccines\nResearchers are using both therapeutic vaccines (such as those that activate immune cells with disease-fighting agents) and preventive vaccines (such as those that can prevent certain types of cancers before tumors develop).\nAdoptive T-Cell Therapy\nInvolves taking cancer-fighting T cells from a patient\u2019s body, activating and multiplying them outside the body, multiplying them and then putting them back into the patient.\nCheckpoint Inhibitors\nBiological checkpoints \u201ctap the brakes\u201d on immune responses after they are no longer needed. Sometimes, diseases such as cancers can affect these checkpoints to limit the immune response and allow cancers to progress. Checkpoint inhibitors reduce a disease\u2019s ability to do so.\nTake a look at the following immunotherapy infographic by Baylor Scott & White Health for everything you need to know about the next frontier in treating disease.\nWe make it easy.\nHealthcare doesn't have to be difficult.
