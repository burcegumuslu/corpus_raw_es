Sound healing, energy healing and connecting with nature and the Great Mother Earth have also been a big part of my life and healing journey and I am very excited to share what has worked for me with other men to support their healing and clearing of old toxic energies that are keeping them from moving forward into a healthier expression and true authentic self.\nIntegrity, confidence without arrogance, emotional balance, self love, feeling connected to source, spiritual, will power, strength without dominance, grounded, compassion, mental clarity, healthy sexual expression, taking responsibility for yourself, empathy and a healthy respect for oneself, others and the planet our great Mother Earth.\nThese are all qualities that are healthy and much needed on the planet. Do you want to connect with other men who are ready to make the shift and do the deep hard work and support their brothers to make this a better planet.\nI have many tribe minded men's support groups/gatherings coming including an intentional drum meditation gathering, empowering drum circles, sharing circles, sound and energy healing, rites of passage and examining and healing our wounds. I will be starting with the sober men's intentional drum meditation gathering. If you are interested and this all sounds good and resonates with you, AWESOME! Join this group to be notified when these events will take place.\nThis is also a sober group which i am very happy to facilitate. This includes no alcohol, cannabis or any other mind and or physically altering substances. Please respect this. I truly believe that it is very important for us to be in our own awareness and energy for true healing to occur.\nThis is an amazing time we are in and more and more men are waking up and realizing that the old ways of doing things are just not working and truly wanting to connect with other healthy mindful men who want to heal themselves and the planet while supporting other men in the process. Healthy masculine connections are so important for men to be healthy and happy.\nThe in person events will be held at a park or nature area (TBA per event) in the Clearwater Florida area.\nThere will also be online events so you will be able to attend from anywhere in the world.\nI look forward to connecting with you.\nIn Lak'ech Ala K'in (I am another yourself) ~Asante", "language": null, "image": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/b/b/600_513753979.jpeg", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["#main", "https://www.meetup.com/es/", "https://www.meetup.com/es/awakening-sacred-masculine/", "https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=us--fl--Clearwater&source=GROUPS", "https://www.meetup.com/es/awakening-sacred-masculine/members/", "/awakening-sacred-masculine/members/?op=leaders", "/awakening-sacred-masculine/join/", "https://www.meetup.com/es/awakening-sacred-masculine/", "https://www.meetup.com/es/awakening-sacred-masculine/events/", "https://www.meetup.com/es/awakening-sacred-masculine/members/", "/awakening-sacred-masculine/photos/", "https://www.meetup.com/es/awakening-sacred-masculine/discussions/", "/awakening-sacred-masculine/join/", "https://www.meetup.com/awakening-sacred-masculine/events/past/", "https://www.meetup.com/awakening-sacred-masculine/events/294231013/", "https://www.meetup.com/awakening-sacred-masculine/events/294167661/", "/awakening-sacred-masculine/members/?op=leaders", "/awakening-sacred-masculine/members/?op=leaders", "https://secure.meetup.com/messages/?new_convo=true&member_id=96788182&name=Asante", "/awakening-sacred-masculine/members/", "/awakening-sacred-masculine/members/", "https://www.instagram.com/healingsacredmasculine/", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Espiritualidad", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Self-Help%20%26%20Self-Improvement", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Salud%20hol%C3%ADstica", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=C%C3%ADrculos%20de%20curaci%C3%B3n", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Sober%20Activities", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Sanaci%C3%B3n%20energ%C3%A9tica", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Pensamiento%20positivo", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Men's%20Support", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Meditation%20Drumming", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Percusi%C3%B3n%20con%20las%20manos", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Intention", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Sanaci%C3%B3n%20espiritual", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Sanaci%C3%B3n%20con%20sonidos", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Espiritualidad%20basada%20en%20la%20tierra", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?keywords=Autoempoderamiento", "https://www.meetup.com/how-to-group-start/", "https://www.meetup.com/how-to-group-start/", "https://www.meetup.com/es/register/?returnUri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meetup.com%2Fawakening-sacred-masculine%2Fabout%2F", "https://www.meetup.com/es/login/?returnUri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meetup.com%2Fawakening-sacred-masculine%2Fabout%2F", "https://www.meetup.com/es/help/", "https://www.meetup.com/lp/affiliate-program/", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?source=GROUPS", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/?source=EVENTS", "https://www.meetup.com/es/topics/", "https://www.meetup.com/es/cities/", "https://www.meetup.com/es/find/online-events/", "https://www.meetup.com/blog/category/local-guides/", "https://www.meetup.com/lp/friendship-and-socializing/", "https://www.meetup.com/es/about/", "https://www.meetup.com/blog/", "https://www.meetup.com/es/meetup-pro/", "https://www.meetup.com/careers/", "https://www.meetup.com/apps/", "https://www.meetup.com/blog/category/keep-connected-podcast/", "https://www.facebook.com/meetup/", "https://twitter.com/Meetup/", "https://www.youtube.com/meetup", "https://www.instagram.com/meetup/", "https://www.tiktok.com/@meetup", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meetup&hl=es-ES", "https://apps.apple.com/es/app/meetup/id375990038", "https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027447252", "https://www.meetup.com/es/privacy/", "https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046339551", "https://www.meetup.com/es/help/"]}
