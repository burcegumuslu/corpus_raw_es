According to a survey by the Indian dating app QuackQuack, \"How can the dating experience be improved?\" 18,000 daters from India and 51% of Gen Z daters unanimously agreed that breaking the toxic dating standards set by millenials is the only way to set a new path and make dating more comfortable. Top 5 toxic dating trends that need to end No is No For GenZ daters a no is a no; it does not mean \"convince me till I say yes.\" Millennials have been, unknowingly or knowingly, following a trend where they keep trying to make someone fall in love, and 37% of GenZ women find it toxic. There's a fine line between convincing and harassing, agreed 21% of male daters between 18 to 22. What 3-Days-Rule? 39% of GenZ participants in the survey said they do not appreciate playing games in love. 18% of men and women above 24 mentioned that playing hard to get falls under the same category of toxic dating trends once followed by Millennial daters but now chucked for its harmful impact on one's mental health. Why should men do all the work? Gen Z is more gender neutral and more inclusive. So for them the fact that men should always make the first move, ask women out, confess their feelings, propose etc. is toxic and sexist. 19% of men between 23 to 26 believe so and over 26% women daters from tier 1 and 2 cities, mentioned that women who want men to take the lead should not expect feminism to have their backs when they face other sexist trends in society. Also watch: Are you falling for a 'Fake-up'? Know all about this dating trend Canceling someone over one fight Breaking up after just one fight is considered immature by 33% of GenZ daters. They explained that being woke about abusive patterns in a relationship is essential, but that does not mean every minor inconvenience should be labeled toxic, and that's what is happening with Millennial daters with half knowledge about unhealthy behavior. Fights are a part of every relationship and how you manage the aftermath decides its toxicity, and that's what these GenZ daters are focusing on. Ladies, split the damn bill 27% of female daters between 20 to 24 think a woman expecting her date to pay the bill on the first date just because they are men is enabling male chauvinism, and it has got to go. Millennials, in their yesteryear, might have counted that as chivalrous, but GenZ female daters and the modern Millennial daters are canceling that trend, and they are all in favor of splitting the check.
