The findings are \u201calarming\u201d, said Kristin Knox, a scientist at Silent Spring Institute and study co-author.\n\u201cIt just highlights that there are a lot of products that people use every day that contain many of these harmful chemicals,\u201d she added.\nVOCs are a widely used class of chemicals that can detach from or are emitted from surfaces or products and move through the air. Many pose health risks and are carcinogenic, or bond with other chemicals to form air pollution.\nThe study is the first analysis to make use of ingredient data that manufacturers are required to submit to the state of California\u2019s air resources board. Carb tracks VOCs in consumer products in an effort to reduce smog. In the presence of sunlight, VOCs react with other air pollutants to form ozone, the main ingredient in smog.\nHowever, the study was limited to VOCs, and many products can contain other chemicals that are not identified. The peer-reviewed research was conducted by the University of California, Berkley, and the Silent Spring Institute environmental non-profit.\nOverall, the research found more than 100 products with VOCs, and 30 \u2013 including a dozen different types of personal care products \u2013 that researchers say deserve special scrutiny because the goods frequently contain VOCs and may pose the greatest health risk. VOCs can be inhaled, ingested or absorbed through the skin, and many products contained more than one kind of the compounds.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just one product at a time, like your dish detergent, it\u2019s the fact that we use multiple products every day and each of these products could have different [VOCs] in them, so all of this really adds up in our daily lives,\u201d said Robin Dodson, a scientist with Silent Spring Institute and study co-author.\nAmong products used on the body, the most common VOC was formaldehyde, which was listed as an ingredient in nail polish, shampoo, makeup and other kinds of personal care items. Industry adds the substance to function as a preservative. Mothballs, meanwhile, emit about 300 tons of 1,4-dichlorobenzene, a likely carcinogen that comprises about 99% of the ingredients in the insect repellant, though Knox noted that safer alternatives, like cedar chips, exist.\nAmong the most toxic ingredients was diethanolamine, which the EU has banned for use in cosmetics, but was found in 40 different US products, including cosmetics and personal care items. It is used as an emulsifier. \u201cThe fact that it is in so many products is kind of worrisome,\u201d Dodson said.\nThe risk is greatest for those who work professionally with VOC-containing products and are consistently exposed to one or multiple chemicals in products. Hair and nail salon workers are likely regularly subjected to about nine VOCs covered by Prop 65 that are added to nail polishes, nail polish removers, artificial nail adhesives, hair straighteners and other cosmetics. Janitors, meanwhile, could use a combination of general cleaners, degreasers, detergents and other maintenance products which could expose them to more than 20 VOCs covered by Prop 65.\nConsumers can take some steps to protect themselves, like reading labels and identifying dangerous chemicals, when possible, or using products outdoors.\nResearchers identified 11 VOCs they say manufacturers should eliminate from products because of their high toxicity, volatility and widespread use, and five that should be banned under the nation\u2019s toxic substances laws. The authors say they also hope California state regulators will use the analysis to identify priority products and chemicals that could be regulated more tightly in consumer goods.\n\u201cWe\u2019re handing them a couple of good ideas based on the analyses,\u201d Knox said.", "language": null, "image":
