The software will walk you through syncing the Wii Balance Board, so simply follow the on-screen instructions. Likewise, if your Wii Balance Board is not currently synced, Wii U Fit will walk you through the syncing process during its first-time setup process.\n- When starting some applications, the Wii Balance Board will turn off. This will make it seem as if it is not synced. However, if the software uses the Wii Balance Board, it will eventually prompt you to turn on the Wii Balance Board. If it does not, turn on the Wii Balance Board by pressing the Power Button.\nComplete these steps\n- Press the SYNC Button on the front of the Wii U once.\n- Remove the battery cover from the bottom of the Wii Balance Board to reveal the SYNC Button. It is a small red button that looks almost identical to the SYNC Button on the Wii U.\n- Press the SYNC Button once.\n- A blue light on the Wii Balance Board Power Button will blink. When it turns solid, the Wii Balance Board is synced.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["https://www.nintendo.com/es_LA/", "/app/home",
