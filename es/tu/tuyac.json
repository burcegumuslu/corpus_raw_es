DC. (Asteraceae) is\na medicinal plant species, native of Brazil, Paraguay,Argentina and Uruguay (Bandoni, 2002). It is commonlyknown as yellow marcela and their inflorescences areused as remedies in folk medicine for the treatment ofa variety of human ailments. They are used as medici-nal tea and are widely known for their choleretic,antispasmodic and digestive actions (Toursarkissian,1980; Kadarian et al., 2002). Other medical properties\nhave been related to Achyrocline  species, such as:\nantioxidant, anti-microbial, antiherpetic, anti-HIV ,hepatoprotective, antihyperglycemic, immunostimulant,insecticidal and molluscicidal (Gutkind et al ., 1981;\nWagner et al ., 1985; Garcia et al ., 1990; Puhlmann et\nal., 1992; Desmarchelier et al ., 1998; Garcia et al .,\n1999; Hnatyszyn et al ., 1999; Carney et al ., 2002;\nGugliucci and Menini, 2002; Ruffa et al., 2002).\nPhytochemical analyses of Achyrocline  spp.\ndemonstrated that they are a rich source of secondarycompounds, including terpenoids, phenylpropanoidsand flavonoids (Ferraro et al ., 1981; Mesquita et al .,\n1986; Broussalis et al ., 1989). Initially, chemistry\nstudies identified many poliphenols such as: galangin,galangin-3-mehtyl ether, quercetin, quercetin-3-methylether, caffeic acid, two esters of calleryanin (3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol 4-glucoside) andprotocatechuic acid (Ferraro et al., 1981 and Broussalis\net al ., 1989). Mesquita et al . (1986) isolated two new\nflavonoids: 5-hydroxy-3,6,7-trimethoxyflavone(alustin) and 5,7,8-trimethoxyflavone which areconsidered very rare flavonoids. A. flaccida is the only\nAchyrocline  species with epoxybutoxy derivatives,\nwhich are difficult to find in other plant species(Broussalis et al ., 1989). Recently, Retta et al . (2008)\nstudied quantitative and qualitative composition ofessential oil in A. flaccida and demonstrated that it is a\nrich source of \u03b1-pinene and \u03b2-caryophyllene.\nConsidering analytical and biological studies, A.\nflaccida  has demonstrated to be a valuable source of\npharmaceutical and cosmetically interesting molecules.For these reasons this species is threatened by theincreased interest of medicinal herb collectors.Therefore, techniques which could provide vegetative\npropagated material for commercial use and for possiblereintroduction are very important. In vitro -propagation\nis consideres a valuable method for producing largenumbers of genetically uniform, pathogen-free plantsin a short time. Moreover, the production of  A. flaccida\nsecondary metabolites in a high quantity and qualitymanner, is an important challenge in order to covermarket demands. Cell suspension culture is a suitablealternative since they are controllable systems andfeasible to scale up (Roberts and Shuler, 1997). Thedevelopment of plant cell culture systems for  theproduction of high value chemicals was driven by thepossibility to manipulate the culture conditions to lead tohigh flux into secondary metabolic pathways, and then tobe able to grow such cultures in large scale bioreactors(Sudha and Ravishankar, 2002). Important metabolites,such as paclitaxel (Taxol) are being successfully producedin cell suspension cultures using elicitors to increaseproduct yield (Zhong, 2002). Besides productive aims, cellculture suspensions are helpful tools to investigatemetabolic pathways involved in secondary metabolitesynthesis and to discover new bioactive molecules.\nThe aim of this study was the optimization of a\nmethod to propagate in vitro  plant cell growth as a first\nstep toward secondary metabolite production.\nMaterials and methods\nPlant material and surface sterilization\nSeeds were collected from a population of A. flaccida\nsituated at the nursery of medicinal and aromatic plantsof the National Agricultural Research Institute (INIA)in Las Brujas, Canelones, Uruguay. They were surfacesterilized by immersions on 20 % (v/v) hypochloritesolution for 15 min under continuous agitation. Theywere immediately rinsed three times with sterile distilledwater and germinated on MS (Murashige and Skoog)medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962).\nIn vitro  culture and micropropagation\nCultures were initiated in 25 x 150 mm test tubes.\nAfterwards, they were transferred to 300 ml glass jarsBonnecarr\u00e8re, V .; Bern\u00e1, L.; Castillo, A.3\nfor shoot proliferation. Inorganic and organic media\nconstituents, growth regulators, and their interactionswere investigated.\nPlants were micropropagated by cutting internodal\nsegments which were located in new media. Three saltmedia were tested: MS, Driver and Kuniyuki Walnut(DKW) (Driver and Kuniyuki, 1984) and Woody PlantMedium (WPM) (Lloyd and McCown, 1981). The effectof cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) was evaluatedby adding 0.3 mg.L\n-1 to each medium. All the media\ncontained 30 g L-1 of sucrose and 8 g L-1 of agar for\nsolidification. The pH was adjusted to 5.8 beforeautoclaving (1.1 kg cm\n-2 at 121\u00ba C for 20 min).  Plants\nwere grown at 22 \u00b1 2\u00ba C with 16-hour photoperiod under3 nmol m\n-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux.  Growth was\nassayed after 4 weeks considering the fresh weight (FW),morphology and presence of plant hyperhydricity. FWdata were analyzed with ANOVA.\nDetermination and optimization of callus induction\nmedium\nCalli were established by culturing segments leaves\nexcised from aseptic seedlings.  Leaves of five weeksold plants were cut into 0.5 cm\n2 segments and placed\nupside down in Petri- dishes containing MS solidifiedwith 0.8 % agar (Agar Chile) and supplemented withcasein (250 mg L\n-1), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid\n(2,4-D) and kinetin (KIN). Three 2,4-D concentrations(0.5 mg L\n-1; 1.0 mg L-1; 1.5 mg L-1), two KIN\nconcentrations (0.5 mg L-1; 1.0 mg L-1) and all possible\ncombinations were tested. Each treatment contained 4replications with 10 explants per replication. Cultureswere maintained at 22 \u00b1 2\u00ba C with 16-hour photoperiodunder 3 nmol m\n-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux.  After\n4 weeks, callus number (percentage), friability and FWwas determined. FW data were analysed with ANOVA.\nGeneration of cell suspensions and establishment\nof optimal cell growth conditions\nFriable callus (1 g wet weight) was transferred to\n50 ml of MS and DKW liquid medium in 300 mlErlenmeyer flask closed with aluminium foil. The mediawas amended either with 1 mg L\n-1 2,4-D or 0.3 mg L-1\nBAP in order to analyze different growth regulators. They\nwere incubated under 16-hour photoperiod at 22 \u00b1 2\u00ba Con an orbital shaker model SLR-25T (Ikeda ScientificCo. Ltd) at 120 rpm. Cell growth was determined bymeasuring cell suspension FW and dry weight (DW)every 3 days over 37 days. Three mL of culture weretaken from each flask and filtered through a filter paper(Whatman \u00ae No. 1) under vacuum suction. The DW\nwas calculated after drying the samples at 65\u00ba C for 48h. The values obtained are the mean of the threereplicates.\nGrowth rates (\u00b5) were calculated according to the\nequation for exponential growth cultures:\n\u00b5 = ln (W1/W2)/t2-t1 (Singer et al ., 1985).\nResults and discussion\nPlant in vitro  culture and micropropagation\nConsidering A. flaccida  seeds small size, the very\nthin tegument thickness and the hardness of thesterilization method it was expected very lowgermination rate. Nevertheless, 100 % of seedgermination was obtained 10 days after disinfection andall plants were able to grow on different culture media.In order to asses the best growth medium, threeparameters were considered: fresh weight, morphologyand hyperhydricity. In all cases, plant fresh weight washigher in media supplied with BAP respect to the samemedium without the regulator (Table 1). However, BAPinduced shorter internodes, forming very compactstructures and all plant showed high degree ofhyperhydricity (Figure 1). Hyperhydricity, also knownas vitrification, is a morphological, anatomical andphysiological malformation that makes the plant tissuewater-swollen (Paques and Boxus, 1987). Thephenomenon has been correlated to water availability,microelements and/or hormonal imbalance in the tissueculture medium (Kataeva et al., 1991).\nMedia salt composition also affected plant\ndevelopment.

In vitro  plants of Achyrocline flaccida grown\nin different culture media.\nin DKW compared to WPM and MS. Considering FW,DKW and WPM did not showed any differences butplants grown in DKW presented better structure.  DKWand WPM contain lower concentration of nitrogen,either nitrate or ammonium, and potassium incomparison to MS. These concentrations resemble na-tural conditions where Marcela normally grows.Possibly high nitrogen or potassium concentrationsinhibit plant development. In addition, the content ofother nutrient such as calcium, and speciallymicronutrient as chloride and iodide, are considerabledifferent among these media. Iodide and chloride areonly present in MS and they may be the responsible ofplant growth inhibition. In conclusion, the best saltmedium for A. flaccida  micropropagation is DKW\nwithout any plant regulator.\nEstablishment of cell suspension cultures\nDespite of the results obtained with entire plants, it\nwas not possible to get friable callus on DKW media.In fact, these results confirm that organogenesis andcallus formation optimal conditions differ, since bothphysiological processes are completely different. Theonly media where friable callus were formed was MS.Consequently it was selected for callus formation. After4 weeks callus were induced in all media containing2,4-D and KIN. However, there were significantdifferences among treatment. Table 2 shows thepercentages of callus formation and the average of callusFW per treatment.  No friable callus was formed from\nexplants cultured on MS without hormones and in allmedium supplied with only  KIN.  On the contrary, allmedia containing 2,4-D, either 0,5 mg L\n-1, 1,0 mg L-1,\nor 1,5 mg L-1, induced friable callus formation. The best\nresults were obtained in medium supplied only with2,4-D regardless the concentration. The growth regulator2,4-D has been cited as the best regulator to inducecallus formation in Rubus idaeus  (Borejsza-Wysoki and\nHrazdin, 1994) and Orthosiphon stamineus  (Lee and\nChang, 2004).\nFriable callus were dispersed on liquid media in order\nto get cell suspensions. Normally, cell suspensions areestablished in the same media were callus are formed(Lee and Chang, 2004). However, in MS media, allsuspension differentiates to roots (data not shown).Considering theses results, DKW was selected asmedium for the establishment of cell culture. In thisThe value corresponds to the mean and the standard error. Differentletter indicate significant differences between treatments.Table 2. Parameters of callus induction in different\ntreatment.Bonnecarr\u00e8re, V.; Bern\u00e1, L.; Castillo, A.5\nmedium no tissue differentiation was registered and it\nwas possible to establish continuous suspensions overone year.\nAuxins, particularly 2,4-D, are commonly used for\nthe establishment of cell suspension cultures (Szabadoset al ., 1991). The action of BAP cytokinin was also\nevaluated. Figure 2 shows the evolution of fresh anddry weight registered over 37 days. All media showed avery large latent phase, approximately 20 days. Therewere differences during the exponential phase. Mediawithout regulators or supplied with BAP had greatergrowth rates (m) compared to DKW supplied with2,4-D (m\nDKW=1.19, mDKW/BAP=1.02 and mDKW/2,4-D 0.99).\nHowever, in DKW supplied with 2,4-D the exponentialphase was longer (10 days) and the FW at the end of theperiod was higher. This increase in FW is not correlatedto DW, where suspensions containing 2,4-D showed thelowest values. It is known that 2,4-D induce theformation of soft callus by increasing the size ofvacuoles (Borejsza-Wysoki and Hrazdin, 1994). Thesame phenomenon could happen in this suspensionculture and it has to be considered for the production of\nmetabolites which are secreted to the vacuole.\nIn summary, cell suspension cultures of A. flaccida\ncould be established from friable callus produced byculturing leaf explants on MS medium supplied with0.5 mg L\n-1 2,4-D. The optimal medium for cell\nsuspension is DKW amended with 1 mg L-1 2,4-D.\nThis study is the preliminary work for upcoming\nexperiments focused on secondary metaboliteproduction by A. flaccida  cell suspension cultures. To\naccomplish this aim it is necessary to evaluate differentcell sources, as stems, roots and petiole. The type ofexplants has been cited as influencing callus formation(Lee and Chang, 2004), cell suspension and metaboliteprofile. Therefore optimal growth conditions andmetabolite production have to be determined for all theseexplants, in order to compare their metabolic profile.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the staff of the in vitro  culture laboratory\nof the Biotechnology Unit and the nursery of medicinaland aromatic plants of the National Institute ofAgriculture Research (INIA) in Las Brujas, Canelones,\nUruguay.\nReferences\nBandoni, L.  2000.
