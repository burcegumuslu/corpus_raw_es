But our hormones are heavily influenced by our energy or state of being.\nWhen something feels off, Western Medicine doctors can test our hormones, but they typically only test and address singular hormones, then prescribe medication for one hormone. Not to mention, these lab results can change dramatically at any moment, depending on our state of being.\nBut here's the truth: because all our hormones are interconnected and communicate with each other, it's not effective to address just ONE hormone. So how can we address and balance all hormones in the body? By balancing our chakra system.\nChakras, a foundational pillar of Eastern Medicine philosophy, are vortexes of energy in the body that correspond to and influence specific glands and hormones. Unless we address our state of being and balance the energy of our chakras, our hormones stand no chance at achieving balance.\nIn this episode, you'll discover:\n\ud83e\uddd8 How our ENERGY influences our body function, and why Western Medicine labs can be unreliable as a result\n\ud83e\uddd8 The faulty effects of hormone medication on our gland function and hormone production\n\ud83e\uddd8 The 7 chakras in the body, the hormones they are associated with, and the impact of chakra imbalance on our hormones\n\ud83e\uddd8 How to use Yoga and meditation as a tool for balancing chakras so that you can naturally balance hormones to get rid of unwanted symptoms\nWant to get started?
