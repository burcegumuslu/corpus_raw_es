Living close to nature, the indigenous Chinese people observed stars and planets and the unique qualities of the four seasons and perceived how humanity responded to these natural phenomena and cycles. Nature\u2019s patterns include daily, monthly, seasonal and lifetime cycles, and with keen insight they perceived the singular, primary influence contained in every cycle and aspect of life: change.\nTwo classic Chinese books, the I Ching (The Book of Changes) and the Nei Jing (The Inner Classic of Chinese Medicine), both highlight change as their central theme. The I Ching presents life as change and provides guidance and advice on how to live in harmony with change.\nLife Cycles\nThe first chapter in the Nei Jing Su Wen presents a major cycle of change: women and men\u2019s transitions through life cycles of seven and eight years. Each stage brings unique, yet natural, qualities each person will experience. The following is a summary of the seven- and eight-year cycles for males and females found in the Nei Jing Su Wen. Males have eight-year cycles, and women have seven-year cycles. These cycles are examples of the Chinese insight that change is a central part of life.\nThe female cycles of seven years are as follows:\n\u2022A woman\u2019s Kidney energy becomes prosperous at seven years of age (1\u00d77).\n\u2022Her menstruation appears as the Ren (Sea of Yin) Channel flows and the Chong (Sea of Blood) Channel becomes prosperous at the age of 14 (2\u00d77).\n\u2022Her Kidney Qi reaches a balanced state, and her teeth are completely developed at the age of 21 (3\u00d77).\n\u2022Her vital energy and blood are substantial, her four limbs are strong and her body is at optimal condition at the age of 28 (4\u00d77).\n\u2022Her peak condition declines gradually. The Yang Ming Channel is depleted, her face withers and her hair begins to fall out at the age of 35 (5\u00d77).\n\u2022Her three Yang Channels, Tai Yang, Yang Ming and Shao Yang, begin to decline. Her face complexion wanes and her hair turns white at the age of 42 (6\u00d77).\n\u2022The Ren and Chong Channels are both declining, her menstruation ends, her physique turns old and feeble, and she can no longer conceive at the age of 49 (7\u00d77).\nThe male cycles of eight years are as follows:\n\u2022A man\u2019s Kidney energy is prosperous, his hair develops and his teeth emerge at the age of eight (1\u00d78).\n\u2022His Kidney energy grows and is filled with vital energy, and he is able to let his sperm out at the age of 16 (2\u00d78).\n\u2022His Kidney energy is developed, his extremities are strong, and all of his teeth are developed by the age of 24 (3\u00d78).\n\u2022His body has developed to its best condition, an...", "language": null, "image": "https://img.perlego.com/books/RM_Books/hachette_uk_ugjdxpj/9780857010643_300_450.webp", "pagetype": null, "links": ["/es", "/es/pricing", "/de/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf", "/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf", null, "/fr/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf", "/it/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf", "/es/login", "/de/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf", "/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf", null, "/fr/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf", "/it/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf", "/es", "/es/search?query=&tab=books&page=1", "/es/browse/medicine", "/es/browse/medicine/acupuncture", "/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf", "/login", "https://help.perlego.com/es/articles/2576705-how-to-cancel-your-subscription-or-delete-your-account", "https://help.perlego.com/es/articles/3312996-downloading-books", "https://help.perlego.com/es/articles/5083207-learn-about-perlego", "https://help.perlego.com/es/articles/6702800-our-commitment-to-accessibility", "/es/publisher/9489/singing-dragon", null, "/es/browse/medicine", "/es/browse/medicine/acupuncture", "/es/pricing", "/es/faq", "/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0c6469607c4c7c697e60696b63226f6361", "/instructors", "/institutions", "/marketing/publishers", "/es/group-register?orgt1=TTaDk9qyh9cdSE6Uta4KIQ==", "https://apply.workable.com/perlego/", "/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#225250475151625247504e47454d0c414d4f", "/es/search?query=&tab=topics&page=1", "/es/search?query=&tab=publisher&page=1&language=English&publicationDate=&topic=&publisher=&author=&format=#SearchTab-wrapper-publishers", "/knowledge/", "/knowledge/study-guides/", "/knowledge/referencing-and-citations/harvard-guide/", "/knowledge/referencing-and-citations/apa-guide/", "/knowledge/essay-writing-guides/", "/es/privacy-policy", "/es/tac", "/es/content-policy", "/es/sitemaps/books?page=0", "/es/sitemaps/subtopics?page=0", "/sitemaps/publishers?page=0", "/es/mission", "/es/cookies", "https://help.perlego.com/articles/6702800-our-commitment-to-accessibility", "https://help.perlego.com/", "/knowledge", "https://policies.google.com/privacy", "https://policies.google.com/terms", "https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/perlego/id1434892958", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.perlego.app&hl=en_GB", "https://www.instagram.com/perlego/", "https://www.facebook.com/perlegobooks/", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/perlego.com/", "https://twitter.com/perlegobooks", "/de/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf", "/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf", null, "/fr/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf", "/it/book/951071/i-ching-acupuncture-the-balance-method-clinical-applications-of-the-ba-gua-and-i-ching-pdf"]}
