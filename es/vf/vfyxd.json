Eleven years later, with Ordinance No. 849, others were added: Art Therapy, Ayurveda, Biodance, Circular Dance, Meditation, Music Therapy, Naturopathy, Osteopathy, Chiropractic, Reflexotherapy, Reiki, Shantala, Integrative Community Therapy, and Yoga(33 Carvalho JLS, N\u00f3brega MPSS. Complementary therapies as resources for mental health in Primary Health Care.

Impacts of integrative and complementary practices on the health of chronic patients. Sa\u00fade Debate. 2018;42(118):724-35. doi: 10.1590/0103-1104201811815\n[https://doi.org/10.1590/0103-11042018118...\n](https://doi.org/10.1590/0103-1104201811815)). The fact that PICs have their demand increased, as well as their insertion in the SUS, points to the beginning of a movement in Brazil in the search for qualifying the form of health care offered to the population, which is gradually more comprehensive, resolutive, and universal(11 Assis WC, Britto FR, Vieira LO, Santos ES, Boery RNSO, Duarte CS. New forms of care through integrative practices in the Brazilian Unified Health System. Rev Bras Promo\u00e7 Sa\u00fade. 2018;31(2):1-6. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.5020/18061230.2018.7575. [http://dx.doi.org/10.5020/18061230.2018....\n](http://dx.doi.org/10.5020/18061230.2018.7575)).\nQigong is a TCM PIC that meets this perspective of health care. And, as already discussed, it is a practice with a high level of recognition for its positive health results. During the process, there is an improvement in the transport of energy and blood through the established body-mind relationship, which influences the blood, the essence, body fluids, and the mind, essential to the human being. In this way, it is possible to adjust and harmonize the flows of Qi and the Yin-Yang of the body, therefore promoting health(66 Matos LC, Sousa CM, Gon\u00e7alves M, Gabriel J, Machado J, Greten HJ. Qigong as a traditional vegetative biofeedback therapy: long-term conditioning of physiological mind-body effects. BioMed Res Int. 2015;53178:6. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/531789\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/531789...\n](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/531789)).\nA study in the area has progressively explored the results of this therapy in different target audiences, for example, people with advanced age and others with chronic health conditions that are not susceptible to transmission, in order to understand its influence in terms of health(66 Matos LC, Sousa CM, Gon\u00e7alves M, Gabriel J, Machado J, Greten HJ. Qigong as a traditional vegetative biofeedback therapy: long-term conditioning of physiological mind-body effects. BioMed Res Int. 2015;53178:6. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/531789\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/531789...\n](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/531789)). However, more evaluations, from studies with recognized methods, are necessary with regard to the physiology involved in the results of therapy, so that it is possible to develop what is known in the area regarding its relationship with the health of practitioners, a reason that encouraged the development of the present study.\nPractices that develop both physical and mental conditions and Quality of Life (QoL), such as the PICs, are the foundation for the search for quality nursing care, carried out during the sharing of knowledge between professionals and users of health. In this sense, there is an appreciation of their active participation in this process(22 Silva LB, Lima IC, Bastos RA. Complementary and integrative therapies: knowledge and use by nursing teachers in a public institution. Rev Sa\u00fade Col UEFS. 2015;5(1):40-5. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.13102/rscdauefs.v5i1.1008\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.13102/rscdauefs.v5i...\n](http://dx.doi.org/10.13102/rscdauefs.v5i1.1008)).\nThe fact that nurses use PICs is related to a humanizing movement for the integration of care, which covers its dissemination, as well as the act of making them legitimate in this context. Although the literature presents solid evidence, there is little use of these practices by professionals in the area and patients(11 Assis WC, Britto FR, Vieira LO, Santos ES, Boery RNSO, Duarte CS. New forms of care through integrative practices in the Brazilian Unified Health System. Rev Bras Promo\u00e7 Sa\u00fade. 2018;31(2):1-6. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.5020/18061230.2018.7575.\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.5020/18061230.2018....\n](http://dx.doi.org/10.5020/18061230.2018.7575)-22 Silva LB, Lima IC, Bastos RA. Complementary and integrative therapies: knowledge and use by nursing teachers in a public institution. Rev Sa\u00fade Col UEFS. 2015;5(1):40-5. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.13102/rscdauefs.v5i1.1008\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.13102/rscdauefs.v5i...\n](http://dx.doi.org/10.13102/rscdauefs.v5i1.1008)).\nTherefore, in order to build a scientific contribution, in addition to optimizing the action of nursing in both care and health production, research that explores the results of the PICs, such as Qigong, with a focus on those related to nursing, are essential. That said, the objective of this systematic review was to analyze, in the literature, evidence about the benefits of the integrative and complementary practice of Qigong with regard to the health of adults and the elderly.\nMethod\nThe literature Systematic Review (SR) method makes it possible to gather, analyze, and synthesize scientific productions regarding a certain clinical issue, so that it is possible to understand, discuss, and establish clinical actions based on evidence(77 Doolen J. Meta-Analysis, systematic, and integrative reviews: an overview. Clin. Simul. Nurs. 2017;13(1):28-30. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecns.2016.10.003\n[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecns.2016.10.0...\n](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecns.2016.10.003)).\nThe methodological trajectory followed was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), through its checklist of items and flow chart for the development of a SR(88 Liberati A, Altman DG, Tetzlaff J, Mulrow C, Gotzsche PC, Loaniddis JPA, et al. The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate healthcare interventions: explanation and elaboration. BMJ. 2009;339:b2700. doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b2700\n[https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b2700...\n](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b2700)-99 Joanna Briggs Institute. Reviewers' manual 2014. Adelaide: University of Adelaide, Joanna Briggs Institute; 2014. [Internet]. [cited Oct 16, 2018]. Available from: http://joannabriggs.org/assets/docs/sumari/reviewersmanual-2014.pdf\n[http://joannabriggs.org/assets/docs/suma...\n](http://joannabriggs.org/assets/docs/sumari/reviewersmanual-2014.pdf)).\nIn order to construct the research question of this SR, the PICO strategy was used: Patient/Population/Problem of interest (P): adults and the elderly; Intervention/Area of Interest (I): practice of Qigong; Comparison (C): not applicable; and Outcomes/Results (O): benefits of practicing Qigong to health. With it, it is possible to identify keywords on the subject. The strategy is essential with regard to the development of the search strategy for relevant primary studies in databases(99 Joanna Briggs Institute. Reviewers' manual 2014. Adelaide: University of Adelaide, Joanna Briggs Institute; 2014. [Internet]. [cited Oct 16, 2018]. Available from: http://joannabriggs.org/assets/docs/sumari/reviewersmanual-2014.pdf\n[http://joannabriggs.org/assets/docs/suma...\n](http://joannabriggs.org/assets/docs/sumari/reviewersmanual-2014.pdf)).\nThus, the following question was obtained: Does the practice of Qigong have beneficial effects on the health of adults and the elderly? The research of the primary studies, carried out from the descriptors presented below, took place in the following databases: N ational Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health (PubMed), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature ( Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ci\u00eancias da Sa\u00fade, LILACS); Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE); and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL) - Cochrane Library.\nFor that, descriptors were used, as well as synonyms, in agreement with the Health Sciences Descriptors ( Descritores em Ci\u00eancias da Sa\u00fade, DeCS), the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and the Emtree from Elsevier Life Science (Emtree), as shown in\n[Figure 1]().\nSearch strategy for the primary studies of the systematic review. Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, SP, Brazil, 2019\nThe following were adopted as inclusion criteria: randomized and non-randomized clinical trials related to the use of Qigong by adults and the elderly; which answer the research question; written in Portuguese, English or Spanish; beginning in January 2008 and ending in December 2018 (considering this as an important historical period for the recognition of Integrative and Complementary Practices [PICs] as the Qigong scientific and political circles); available on the mentioned bases. The exclusion criteria adopted were the following: not selecting research studies related to medical Qigong (external); which did not discuss assessing the effects of Qigong or did not present a correct definition of it; and which presented only clinical trial protocols, without obtaining results.\nThe search was carried out concomitantly in November 2018, through the five databases mentioned. When crossing the descriptors, 334 articles were found. In order to manage the research studies, the Rayyan QCRI\u00ae and EndNote Web\u00ae software were used. The same programs were used to export, organize, and filter studies with respect to duplication in the databases. The studies were pre-selected when reading titles and abstracts and, finally, they were selected for this review through complete reading in order to include them in the sample. Pre-selection was also carried out by reading the title and summary and, finally, selecting the studies for the final review by reading them in full for inclusion in the sample.\nData extraction was performed by two reviewers, independently. The recommendations of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials(1010 Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gotzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, et a. Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Group. CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials. J Clin Epidemiol. 2010;63(8):e1-37. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.03.004\n[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010....\n](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.03.004)) were adopted for the careful reading of each included clinical trial, and a summary table was elaborated with the following information for the full analysis: identification (title and abstract); introduction (scientific basis, justification and objectives); method (type of study, inclusion and exclusion criteria of participants, interventions performed, hypotheses, sample size, randomization, blinding and statistical analysis); results (recruitment, baseline data, numbers analyzed, estimates, auxiliary analyzes and unwanted effects and damage in the groups analyzed); discussion (limitations, generalization and interpretation of results); conclusion; and protocol records. Both the research design and the level of evidence of the articles were carried out, so that it was possible to classify them according to the evidence hierarchy(1111 Polit DF, Beck CT. Fundamentos de pesquisa em enfermagem: avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de evid\u00eancias para a pr\u00e1tica de Enfermagem. 9ed. Porto Alegre: Artmed; 2018.).\nThe critical evaluation of the studies was carried out based on the recommendation of the Cochrane Collaboration(1212 Higgins JPT, Altman DG. Assessing risk of bias in included studies. In: Higgins JPT, Green S, editors. Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. Version 5.1.0 [updated March 2011]. The Cochrane Collaboration. [Internet]. 2011. [cited 2019 Jan, 22]. Available from: http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/\n[http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/...\n](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/)) for assessing the risk of clinical trial bias. It is a tool that allows for the assessment of several types of bias found in clinical trials, being organized into seven domains, with three categories each, namely: high risk of bias, low risk of bias, and uncertain risk of bias. Such an instrument was chosen because it was necessary to analyze the level of the research methodology found in the SR, so that the results from the scientific evidence in the literature were reliable.\nResults\n28 studies were selected that were compatible with the inclusion criteria adopted for this SR, and studies were not added from the review of the references of this selected sample, as shown in\n[Figure 2]().\nFlow of study selection, according to the adaptation of PRISMA(88 Liberati A, Altman DG, Tetzlaff J, Mulrow C, Gotzsche PC, Loaniddis JPA, et al.

Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, SP, Brazil, 2019\nRegarding the main authorship of the articles, 13 (46.4%) were physicians, eight (28.6%) were nurses, two (7.1%) were psychologists, two (7.1%) were occupational therapists, one (3.6%) was a pharmacist, one (3.6%) was a physical educator, and one (3.6%) was a physical therapist. It was also noted that 15 (53.6%) of the studies were carried out in China, five (17.9%) in Germany, three (10.7%) in the United States, two (7.1%) in Sweden, two (7.1%) in Korea, and one (3.6%) in Thailand.\n[Figure 3](), presents the description of the studies analyzed in the SR.\nDescription of the studies included in the systematic review, according to year of publication and titles. Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, SP, Brazil, 2019\nAll the articles submitted for analysis were published in English, and 21 of them were in different journals with a predominance (n = 24) of medical journals. Only one was not randomized, although all were evaluated with level of evidence of II, considered strong, according to the theoretical framework adopted(1111 Polit DF, Beck CT. Fundamentos de pesquisa em enfermagem: avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de evid\u00eancias para a pr\u00e1tica de Enfermagem. 9ed. Porto Alegre: Artmed; 2018.).\nThe works were critically evaluated, according to\n[Figure 4](), with the risk of bias assessment, in accordance with the criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration(1212 Higgins JPT, Altman DG. Assessing risk of bias in included studies. In: Higgins JPT, Green S, editors. Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. Version 5.1.0 [updated March 2011].

Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, SP, Brazil, 2019\nIn order to fulfill the objective of this SR and to conduct a comparison between the data obtained and the literature, the articles were organized into five thematic categories. The first was established regarding health prevention associated with therapy, in which E9(2121 Hung HM, Yeh SH, Chen CH. Effects of Qigong Exercise on Biomarkers and Mental and Physical Health in Adults With at Least One Risk Factor for Coronary Artery Disease.

Also, the intervention (12 weeks) showed important results in lipid profiles, with significantly lower mean levels; however, not with regard to protein (hs-CRP), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and fasting plasma sugar(2121 Hung HM, Yeh SH, Chen CH. Effects of Qigong Exercise on Biomarkers and Mental and Physical Health in Adults With at Least One Risk Factor for Coronary Artery Disease.

That said, it is necessary to encourage studies focusing on the results of Qigong, considering prevention and health promotion, since most research studies seek to investigate people with established diseases.\nSeveral research studies on the subject also indicated improvements in breathing, circulation, relaxation, and functions related to cognition due to the practice of Qigong, similarly to the findings of this study(4141 Lottermann PC, Sousa CA, Liz CM.

There was also evidence capable of positively associating the practice with the management of risk factors related to cardiovascular diseases, that is, Qigong is relevant to promote health and prevent illnesses for adults and for the elderly.\nCOPD patients, mostly elderly, also found benefits from the practice of Qigong regarding pulmonary function, functional capacity, quality of life, and reduced fatigue. Such results are in line with another SR on the relationship between Qigong and COPD(4141 Lottermann PC, Sousa CA, Liz CM. Exercise programs for people with COPD: A systematic review. Arq Cienc Sa\u00fade UNIPAR. 2017 [cited Aug 16, 2018];21(1):65-75.

A number of studies on the improvement of depression in adults and the elderly by Qigong associate this result with the reduction of stress-related signals received by the limbic system, in the hippocampus and in the amygdala, in view of the connection between mind/attention with a confirmed focus through therapeutic practice, which consequently demonstrates having an effect on the secretion of the hormone responsible for releasing corticotrophin from the hypothalamus and, as well as from that adrenocorticotrophic (ACTH) by the hypophysis(4747 Chang P, Knobf MT, Oh B, Funk M.

In this way, a relevant endogenous release of pain control is related to the practice of Qigong in the studies(4949 Sawynok J.

The effects of Qigong with regard to the pituitary-hypothalamus-adrenal axis, play an important role in the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia(4949 Sawynok J.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Baduanjin Qigong for Health Benefits: Randomized Controlled Trials. Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2017;2017:17. doi: https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/4548706\n[https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/4548706...\n](https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/4548706)).\nWith regard to the effects on oncology, a prospective longitudinal research has shown that it is even possible to consider the practice, inserted in the lifestyle, as protective with regard to the reduction of deaths due to neoplasms, by stimulating the immune system and controlling the inflammatory response related to the disease(5353 Khattar E, Kumar P, Liu CY, Akincilar SC, Raju A, Lakshmanan M, et al. Telomerase reverse transcriptase promotes cancer cell proliferation by augmenting tRNA expression. J Clin Investig. 2016;126:4045-60. doi: 10.1172/JCI86042\n[https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI86042...\n](https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI86042)).\nIt is also noted, in the research considered, an increase in the duration and intensity of the positive results of Qigong, proportional to the quantity practiced. This, therefore, needs to be considered to recommend engaging in research studies that aim to investigate the results of this practice for health. Therefore, an intervention protocol of at least four weeks is recommended, based on the results found in this SR.\nQigong is based on the development of self-knowledge, making its practitioner active and capable of preventing and curing diseases throughout life. Thus, Qigong is shown as a mind-body exercise modality that can be easily practiced by adults and very beneficial in the long term, as shown in the results of this study.\nThrough the critical evaluation conducted, it was possible to verify a high risk of bias in the research blinding domains, since this was impossible, and there was a probability of influencing the evaluation of the results, which lacked adequate control or, therefore, a clear description of the protocol and analysis(5454 Chang PS, Chao AM, Jang M, Lu YYF. Intervention fidelity in Qigong randomized controlled trials: a method review. Geriatr Nurs. 2019;40(1):84-90. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2018.07.001\n[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2018...\n](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2018.07.001)).\nIt is recommended to carry out new randomized clinical trials with a high level of methodology focusing on this research subject. In addition, in order to assess the practice of Qigong, longitudinal research studies involving healthy people are necessary to compose the baseline.\nConclusion\nIt is possible to understand the physiological results from the practice of Qigong through the scientific evidence identified and submitted to evaluation, which makes this study of great contribution, since it brings a synthesis of the production regarding the use of an integrative and complementary practice in health, based on the most relevant scientific findings available.\nThe SR revealed the beneficial application of Qigong in the promotion, prevention, and rehabilitation of diseases and physiological disorders in adults and the elderly, such as: cancer; fibromyalgia; Parkinson\u2019s disease; COPD; Burnout; stress; social isolation; chronic low back pain; cervical pain; buzz; osteoarthritis; fatigue; depression; and cardiovascular diseases. This reinforces the need to strengthen the use of PICs, such as the Qigong, in health care with a view to ensuring comprehensiveness and to improving the health care assistance offered to adults and elderly individuals.\n-\n*\nPaper extracted from master`s thesis \u201cDevelopment and validation of digital technologies directed to the teaching of an integrative and complementary health practice\u201d, presented to Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, PAHO/WHO Collaborating Centre at the Nursing Research Development, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, SP, Brazil.\nReferences\n-\n1Assis WC, Britto FR, Vieira LO, Santos ES, Boery RNSO, Duarte CS.
