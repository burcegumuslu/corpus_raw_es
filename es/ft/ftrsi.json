You do not need to put up with debilitating symptoms that affect your daily life, work, relationships and your future health. There is safe, low-cost, effective treatment available, and everybody should know about this and have access to it, should they wish.\nI am passionate about providing evidenced-based and unbiased information to those experiencing the perimenopause and menopause, and so it is very important to me that all the content and education provided remains independent. Everything throughout the balance ecosystem is written by myself or my committed team; no pharmaceutical companies or similar have any input on our work.\nFacilitating the world\u2019s largest menopause library in this way takes a lot of dedication and hard work but it is a process we are all committed to in pursuit of giving individuals the knowledge and tools that allow them to navigate their menopause experience and objectively find what is best for their body.\nEmpower yourself with knowledge\n[\n](https://www.balance-menopause.com/menopause-library/endometriosis-i-went-through-a-medical-menopause-at-24/)\nEndometriosis: I went through a medical menopause at 24\nEmily Griffiths shares her story of endometriosis, adenomyosis and menopause Endometriosis is [\u2026]\n[\n](https://www.balance-menopause.com/menopause-library/osteoporosis-how-to-protect-your-bones-during-menopause-and-beyond/)\n200Osteoporosis: how to protect your bones during menopause and beyond\nBone density for women can plummet around the time of the perimenopause [\u2026]\n[\n](https://www.balance-menopause.com/menopause-library/menopause-and-the-workplace-booklet/)\nCreating and working in a menopause confident organisation Booklet\nAre you looking to introduce support for menopause in the workplace?
