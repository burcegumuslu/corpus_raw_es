The book will cover the philosophy underpinning general\npractice in the 21st Century, and deal with primary and secondary prevention\nas well as acute and chronic disease management.\nGeneral Practice: The Integrative Approach will inform doctors as fully as possible about potential treatment and prevention options, as well as potential pitfalls according to the growing evidence base in this area. The book is directed at best practice rather than alternative practice. The first section of the textbook lays the foundations and principles of Integrative Medicine and the second section examines important medical conditions in a systems based approach.\nEach chapter begins by detailing the allopathic medical and consulting knowledge required of a standard GP text, discussing physiology and pharmacological management plans of systems-based conditions. The chapter then leads into an evidence-based discussion of the therapeutic options available for the treatment of associated factors, essentially providing practitioners with the knowledge required to adapt their approach to meet the needs of the individual patient.\nA national panel of experts with experience in Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, nutritional medicine, naturopathy, and exercise therapy have contributed to their various fields of expertise to incorporate management plans that utilise a variety of therapeutic modalities to achieve the best clinical outcome.\nKey Features\n- Incorporates evidence-based and safe therapies including conventional medical care, lifestyle interventions, complementary therapies.\n- Approach is holistic in focus\n- Focuses on prevention and health promotion\n- Symptomatic layout matches the approach of contemporary medical curriculum\n- Each therapeutic modality and therapeutics contributor will be allocated an icon, throughout the book the icon will appear near the corresponding therapeutics text for easy modality reference\n- Unique chapter \u2013 Integrative Medicine and the Law \u2013 covering medico-legal issues.\n- Ready reference herb/drug interaction chart\nTable of contents\nSection 1\nS1.A: Introduction to the concept of Integrative Medicine\nS1.B: Evidence-based health care\nS1.C: Finding information on integrative medicine\nS1.D: Therapeutic modalities\nS1.E: Principles of Herbal Medicine\nS1.F: Herb-drug interactions\nS1.G: The essence of good health\nS1.H: Education and behaviour change strategies\nS1.I: Stress management and mind-body medicine\nS1.J: Exercise as therapy\nS1.K: Clinical nutrition: food as therapy and nutritional supplements\nS1.L: Connectedness and the role of social support\nS1.M: Spirituality and the role of meaning\nS1.N: Environment\nS1.O: Consulting room\nS1.P: Domestic violence\nS1.Q: Medico legal issues\nS1.R: Practice management principles\nS1.S: Consulting skills and communication\nS1.T: Prevention and screening\nS1.U: The general check-up\nS1.V: Emergencies in general practice\nS1.W: Safe Detox\nSection 2\nS2.01: Abnormal blood tests\nS2.02: Adolescent health and development\nS2.03: Ageing\nS2.04: Allergies\nS2.05: Blood\nS2.06: Bones\nS2.07: Breast disease\nS2.08: Cancer\nS2.09: Cardiovascular\nS2.10: Child health and development\nS2.11: Diabetes\nS2.12: Ear, nose and throat\nS2.13: Eyes\nS2.14: Endocrine\nS2.15: Fitness to drive\nS2.16: Gastrointestinal\nS2.17: Genetic abnormalities\nS2.18: Geriatric medicine\nS2.19: Gynaecology\nS2.20: Musculoskeletal medicine\nS2.21: Hair\nS2.22: HIV/AIDs\nS2.23: Injury prevention\nS2.24: Joints and connective tissues\nS2.25: Menopause\nS2.26: Medical Ethics\nS2.27: Nails\nS2.28: Neurology\nS2.29: Pain management\nS2.20: Palliative Care\nS2.31: Pregnancy and antenatal care\nS2.32: Women's health\nS2.33: Men's health\nS2.34: Psychiatry and psychological medicine\nS2.35: Peri-operative care\nS2.36: Respiratory\nS2.37: Sexual Health\nS2.38: Erectile dysfunction\nS2.39: Skin\nS2.40: Sleep disorders\nS2.41: Sports medicine\nS2.42: Substance abuse\nS2.43: Travel medicine\nS2.44: Urology\nS2.45: Weight problems and eating disorders\nAuthor Information\nBy Kerryn Phelps, MBBS(Syd), FRACGP, FAMA, Adjunct Professor, School Public Health and Discipline General Practice, University of Sydney, Australia and Craig Hassed, Senior Clinical Lecturer, Deputy Head of Department, Department of General Practice, Monash University\n[Tel 91 593 99 99](tel:003491 593 99 99)\nFax 91 448 21 88\n[Dir](/contacto)\nC/ Artesanos, 46\nC/ Artesanos, 46\nParque Empresarial Prado del Espino\n28660 Boadilla del Monte\nMadrid\n[Mailinfo@axon.es](mailto:info@axon.es)\n\u00a9 2023 Ax\u00f3n Librer\u00eda S.L.\n2.87.2", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["/", null, "/resultados/tags/libros/medicina general", "/resultados/tags/libros/medicina natural | medicina integrativa", "tel:003491 593 99 99", "/contacto", "mailto:info@axon.es", "/privacidad", "/condiciones", "/quienes-somos", "/aviso-legal", "/contacto", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/axon-libreria", "https://www.pinterest.es/axonlibreria/", "https://twitter.com/axonlibreria", "https://www.facebook.com/libreriaaxon"]}
