Tuesday\u2019s deal could be expanded further by another 18 months into 2022 and 2023, Oxford Biomedica said, sending its share price up 2.1% to 862 pence.\n\u201cOur previously announced partnership with the UK\u2019s Vaccine Manufacturing Innovation Centre (VMIC) has supported our ability to make additional facilities available for this supply agreement,\u201d said Oxford Biomedica\u2019s Chief Executive John Dawson.\nThe company, however, did not specify how many doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine it expects to produce under the expanded deal, which is for \u201clarge-scale commercial manufacture,\u201d according to its statement.\n(Story corrects para 3 to say EU (not U.S.) approval for Imfinzi)\nReporting by Pushkala Aripaka and Aakash Jagadeesh Babu in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham and Susan Fenton\nOur Standards:\n[The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)", "language": null, "image": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200901&t=2&i=1531767644&r=LYNXMPEG8025P&w=800", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/global-gateway.html", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/login.html", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216467423-Contact-Reuters", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us", "https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/businessNews", "https://www.reuters.com/journalists/pushkala-aripaka", "https://www.reuters.com/journalists/aakash-b", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "//www.reuters.com/tools/mobile", "//newslink.reuters.com/join/subscribe", "//sales.reuters.com/en/ ", "//www.reuters.com/advertising-guidelines", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#cookies", "//www.reuters.com/terms-of-use", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "javascript:window.OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();", "https://www.reuters.com/info/disclaimer", "https://thomsonreuters.com/copyright/"]}
