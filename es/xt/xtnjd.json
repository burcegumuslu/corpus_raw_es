Introduction  \n1. Special procedures are mandated by the Human Rights Council to report to it on \ntheir activities  (see annex ).   \n2.  At the fifteenth annual meeting of special procedures, held in Geneva from 23 to \n27 June 2008 , mandate holders supported the periodic issuance of a joint communications  \nreport to prevent inconsistencies among mandate holders reporting on the same \ncommunications to the Council; avoid duplication and rationalize documentation; allow the \nexamination of cross -cutting human rights issues; and ensure that the content of \ncommunicat ions and any follow -up would feed into the universal periodic review process \nmore effectively (A/HRC/10/24, para  34-35). In 2009, the sixteenth annual meeting of \nspecial procedures mandate holders decided that a joint communic ations report would be \nprepare d (cf. A/HRC/12/47,  para 24-26), with this decision being reconfirmed by the \nseventeenth annual meeting of special procedures in 2010. Mandate holders decided that \nthe report should contain summaries of communications, and statistical information \n(A/HRC/15 /44, para. 26 -27).  \n3. The Outcome  document of the review of the work and functioning of the Human \nRights Council calls on the Office of the High Commissioner  for Human Rights  to maintain \ninformation on special procedures in a comprehensive and eas ily acce ssible manner , and \nencourages the use of modern information technology to reduce the circulation of paper \n(A/HRC/RES/16/21, Annex, para. 24, 29 and 60).  \n4.  The report strengthen s transparency , efficiency  and reduces documentation and \nrelated costs. Short summaries of allegation s communicated to the respective State or other \nentity are included in the report, and the communications sent and responses received are \naccessible electronically  through hyperlinks .  \n5. Communications are reproduced in the language  in which they were sent.  Replies \nreceived in Arabic, Chinese or Russian are included with translations into English , where \navaila ble.  \n6. This report covers all urgent appeals and letters of allegations sent by special \nprocedures mandate holders between 1 June 2011 and 3 0 November  2011 and all replies \nreceived between 1 August 2011 and 31 J anuary  2012. Communcations sent before 1 June \n2011 have been reported in A/HRC/18/51.  \n7. The report also includes replies received between 1 August 2011 and 31 January \n2012, relating to communications sent by special procedures mandate holders before 1 June \n2010. Some of these  replies  supplement information communicated earlier by the \nrespective State.   \n9. The report contains urgent appeals sent by the Working Group on Arbitrary \nDetention and by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and joint \nurgent appeals sent by them together with other mandates.  It does not contain other types \nof communications issued by these mandates, processed according to t heir own distinctive \nprocedures, which are reported exclusively in the annual repo rts of these two working \ngroups . \n10. The names of some alleged victims have been obscured  in order to protect their \nprivacy and prevent further victimization. Names of concer ned individuals who were \nsubject to victim protection measures are mentioned only when the concerned individual \nhas expressively consented or requested to include his or her name in the public report. In \nthe original communications, the full names of the a lleged victims were provided to the A/HRC/19/44  \n 7 Government concerned. Names of alleged perpetrators have systematically been blackened \nout in State replies to preserve the presumption of their innocence.  \n11. In preparing the statistics included in this report , the reporting period have been \nused, reflect ing all communications sent over a six-month  period , between 1  June 2011 and \n30 November 2011 , and responses received in relation to these communications up to \n31 January  2012.

The Ivalo cooperative in Nellim district, made up of both Sami and \nnon-Sami reindeer herders, planned to force four Sami herders to conduct a slaughter of their \nreindeer in late -September 2011. Sami herders were targeted because they have, over the  years, \nslaughtered fewer reindeer than other herders. However, the decision of the Ivalo cooperative did \nnot take into account the fact that Sami must maintain larger herds because of their traditional \nnomadic herding practices, which are different from t he practices of non -Sami reindeer herders, \nwho keep their animals fenced in. In its response, the Government stated that the UN Human \nRights Committee requested that no slaughter of reindeer be conducted while the case is being \nconsidered by Committee.  28/10/2011  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n30/09/2011  \nJAL \n DEU 1/2011  \nGermany  \n \n Terrorism;  \nTorture;   \n Concern that  German authorities might have directly or indirectly participated in the arrest, \ndetention, conviction and imprisonment of a person in Morocco without assessing whether there \nare substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjec ted to torture or \nother forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

Reports of lack of access to \nfood and water for migrants whilst in detention or in certain areas due to migrant workers being \nexcluded from distribution of food and other essential items according to house registration \nrecords have also been received. It is further alleged that migrant workers have been denied \naccess to emergency shelters as some facilities have allegedly been open to Thai citizens only, \nwhilst other shelters have required the holding of a recommendation or certifica te from the \nMinistry of Labour. According to information received, migrant workers have furthermore had \ndifficulties in accessing assistance due to poor or little access to information.

There are serious concerns that these amendments could \nseriously and arbitrarily restrict the free exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly \nand of association. In addition, there are grounds to believe t hat such restrictive amendments and \nthe situation of Mr. Ales Bialiatski could be part of a broader effort by the Government of \nBelarus to obstruct and criminalise the legitimate activities of human rights defenders, activists as \nwell as de facto and de ju re associations working in the defence and promotion of human rights \nand fundamental freedoms, including those who may be critical of actions and policies of the \nGovernment.
