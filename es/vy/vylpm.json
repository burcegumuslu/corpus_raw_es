Temple's Angel Pag\u00e1n sheds light on the truth.", "sitename": "Temple Health", "date": "2021-07-01", "id": null, "license": null, "body": null, "comments": "", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "I've heard many Hispanic and LatinX people in the community tell me they\u2019re hesitant to get the\n[COVID-19 vaccine](/2019-novel-coronavirus/vaccine-information). While there\u2019s a lot of great information out there about COVID-19 and the vaccine, there\u2019s also a lot of misinformation on social media. It can be hard to know what to believe.\nFor me, the vaccine helped relieve my fears. I was concerned when I first heard about\n[COVID-19](/services/conditions/covid-19). I\u2019m a cancer survivor and I have diabetes. Both conditions place me in the high-risk category for getting COVID-19.\nI\u2019ve received the vaccine and have also done a lot of research. I\u2019d like to share some of the most common questions I\u2019ve heard from people in my community and provide answers from credible sources.\nI\u2019d also like to reassure everyone in the Hispanic and LatinX community that the COVID vaccine is the safest way to protect your health and the health of your children and your family.\nWhat are the side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine?\nThe most common side effects are redness, pain and swelling in the arm where the shot is given. People have also shared that they\u2019re tired, have headaches and muscle aches. Some people may have fever, chills or nausea, too.\nThe good news is that side effects usually go away within a day or two. Also, these reactions mean that your body\u2019s immune system is charging up to protect you from the virus that causes COVID-19. I always tell people to keep an eye on any symptoms after they get their shot, and call their doctor if they have any concerns.\nWas the vaccine rushed?\nIt\u2019s true that the vaccines were developed very quickly, but it\u2019s also true that the research teams followed protocols to help ensure the vaccines are safe and effective.\nBecause the virus was spreading rapidly across the United States and the world, the research teams received support from government agencies to make the clinical trial process more efficient and help put an end to the pandemic. We\u2019ve learned a lot from previous viral outbreaks, and know vaccines are the best way to protect large populations of people from getting life-threatening viruses.\nOne of the reasons the vaccines happened so fast was that thousands of people immediately signed up for the clinical trials.\nDuring the clinical trials, researchers studied how effective the vaccines are in preventing COVID. Before they were approved for Emergency Use Authorization, they were also tested for safety.\nThe vaccines are held to the very same safety standards as other vaccines, such as the flu vaccine, which is given every year. We continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines as more and more people get vaccinated.\nDoes the vaccine contain harmful ingredients?\nThe vaccines use ingredients that are safe. These ingredients provide protection from the virus and keep the vaccines safe and long-lasting. The COVID vaccines teach your immune system to recognize and get rid of the virus that causes COVID-19. The vaccines cannot infect you with the COVID-19 virus, and do not interact with your DNA in any way.\nOur immune system protects us from harmful viruses, so why do we need a vaccine?\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\n[people who are LatinX and Hispanic are more likely to get COVID-19 than any other racial or ethnic group](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html). They\u2019re also more likely to get a serious case of COVID. Children who are exposed to or get COVID-19 are especially susceptible to a rare but serious condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C.\nThe COVID vaccine was designed to teach your immune system to recognize and fight the virus. This helps you, your family and your community stay healthy without experiencing sickness, serious complications or loss of life.\nCan the COVID-19 vaccine cause infertility?\nThere\u2019s no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine is a risk to unborn babies or to a person\u2019s ability to get pregnant. If you\u2019re trying to get pregnant now, or planning to try in the future, you should feel safe about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.\nIf you\u2019re breastfeeding, you should also feel safe to get the vaccine.\nAs researchers continue to study those who have received the vaccine, there have been reports that breastmilk in vaccinated mothers may contain immunity proteins that help protect your baby from the virus that causes COVID-19.\nWhat else should we know about getting the vaccine?\nThe COVID vaccine is absolutely the best way for everyone to protect themselves from the virus that causes COVID-19. Even if you\u2019ve already had COVID-19, getting the vaccine helps protect you from getting it again. It also protects those most vulnerable in our communities, including those who have health conditions and children who are not yet eligible for vaccination.\nWhen I hear that someone in my community won\u2019t protect themselves because of false information or because of something they\u2019ve read about on social media, I feel that\u2019s an opportunity for education.\nI\u2019d like to encourage everyone in my community to read as much as you can from credible sources such as your local hospital, doctor\u2019s office or the CDC, and get your COVID-19 shot as soon as you can.\n[Get answers to more COVID vaccine questions from the Hispanic and Latino community >](/about/blog/why-hispanic-latino-families-may-be-wary-about-covid-19-vaccine)\nWhere to Get Vaccinated\nThese vaccines will be available in retail pharmacies, pediatrician's offices, children's hospitals, vaccine clinics and other locations.\nYou can search online or check government websites like\n[vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/search/?medications=25f1389c-5597-47cc-9a9d-3925d60d9c21) to find out where the vaccine is being given near you.\nThere are also a number of vaccine clinics located throughout the Philadelphia area.
