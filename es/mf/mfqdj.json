We -- Nicola and Roger -- have arrived here to share in the discovery of Self through communal living. We invite anyone who resonates with our purpose, vision and intentions to share in our journey of awakening at our ecovillage.\nOur purpose is to harmonise the inner reality of the human spirit with the outer reality of pristine nature. Mindfulness is our way of being in the world.\n\ud83e\uddd8 Meditation is foundational to the life of this community. We are attuned to the presence of Divinity within, which manifests throughout our daily lives through commitment to our practice.\n\ud83c\udf31 We eat an exclusively plant-based, wholefoods diet based on what grows here and in our local environs. Our approach to food is minimal, optimal and sustainable. We love what we have and we appreciate the abundance of what nature provides us daily. Staple foods are banana, papaya, jackfruit, taro, coconut, and greens. We also keep dry-goods such as beans and peanuts in storage.\n\ud83d\ude4f A healthy community is built upon integrity, respect, honesty and commitment. The relationships we cultivate between one another here importantly contribute to the overall harmony of the community.\nTipos de ayuda y oportunidades de aprendizajeProyectos art\u00edsticosJardiner\u00edaConstrucci\u00f3n y bricolajeCuidado de ni\u00f1os y juegos creativosCocinar para toda la familiaAyuda dom\u00e9sticaMantenimiento generalAyuda inform\u00e1tica\nObjetivos de sostenibilidad de las NU que intenta conseguir este anfitri\u00f3n\nIntercambio cultural y oportunidades de aprendizaje\nIn our experience, a community is a microcosm of creation; for those who live in it and share in its life, it becomes a world unto itself, in which the whole order of existence is related from part to whole. In this sense, living as part of a community offers an antidote to the level of disconnect that we experience in contemporary culture.\nIf you have not lived in a communal or intentional space before, then it will certainly require some adaptation to assimilate with the life of the community. Think about your first day, your first week at a new job: you are gradually getting a sense of how the place works and what your role is in the organization.\nLiving in a community requires a very different orientation to living in regular society. The pattern of life is not individualistic, but shared; this requires a willingness to live beyond your comfort zone and contribute to activities that enhance the experience of community life.\nEverybody comes to an ecovillage with their own unique attributes, perspectives, dreams and gifts. To honour and respect the needs of individuals whilst harmonizing in pursuit of a collective vision is the goal of community: it is a balance, a dance, a work in progress to which we are all aspiring in our day-to-day life.\nFor some, finding the balance between \u2018me\u2019 and \u2018ours\u2019 is intuitive and easy; others find it challenging to navigate the unfamiliar terrain beyond societal norms. A lot of these subtleties about the way humans share space can only be understood meaningfully through lived experience.\nThe way of life that we offer here is simple, yet profoundly healing: everybody comes here with a yearning to connect with a more tranquil state of being, and departs with a renewed sense of purpose and peace. Nicola and Roger, the hosts of this space, are here to share about the journey of self-realisation.\nAyuda\nEverybody here contributes four hours of active service per day, six days a week, to the upkeep of our beautiful home in nature. What you spend your time doing in support of the community really depends on your unique capacity, skillset and personal inspiration.\nWhilst there may be one thing that you are really good at, we all contribute in a small way to all aspects of our daily life, which often requires learning a new skill. Gardening is a priority, as we live off-grid, but there are myriad ways you can express your creativity through offering work on a daily basis. For example:\n\ud83c\udf31Organic gardening, permaculture or syntropic agriculture\n\u2600\ufe0f Off-grid systems management (solar and micro-hydro power, water supply)\n\ud83d\ude99 Vehicle maintenance (electric/diesel)\n\ud83d\udd28Carpentry, furniture-making and joinery\n\ud83c\udf49 Cooking and food preparation\n\ud83e\uddf9 Housekeeping, tidying, and domestic management\n\ud83c\udfa8 Childcare, homeschooling and early learning\n\ud83e\uddf5 Repairs, mending, sewing or crafts\n\ud83d\udcbb Publicity, digital media and communications\n\ud83c\udfa5 Videography and filmmaking\nIdiomas hablados\nBislama: Fluido\nIngl\u00e9s: Fluido\nItaliano: Principiante\nAlojamiento\nShared accommodation (men's and women's dorms) in spacious, well-appointed cob bungalows with a view of the mountain and a located beside a river for swimming.

This is to encourage attunement to your own inner nature and the people that share this sacred space.\nUn poco m\u00e1s de informaci\u00f3n\nAcceso a Internet\nAcceso a Internet limitado\nTenemos animales\nSomos fumadores\nPuede alojar familias\n\u00bfCu\u00e1ntos voluntarios puedes hospedar?\nM\u00e1s de dos\nHoras esperadas\nMaximum 4 hours a day, 6 days a week\nComentarios (2)\n[Frantz & Maelle](/es/workawayer/DuoAwake)) para el anfitri\u00f3n\nIt was absolutely awesome to live this adventure and share experiences with each of the member of the community.\nMaitri and Gregory came to the airport to pick us up and give us all the infos about the way to go to the place we will live.\nThey introduced us to a\n[\u2026 read more](#) [Sara](/es/workawayer/hopesara))\nWe all appreciated her keen intelligence, adaptability to any task, willingness to listen and great sense of humour.
