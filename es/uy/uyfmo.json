The phases, microstructures, room temperature and hot flexural strength, resistance to cement clinker corrosion and strength of coating adherence were investigated respectively. It indicated that the addition of Al2O3 increased mainly resulting in the content of tetracalcium aluminoferrite (C4AF) and tricalcium aluminate (C3A) increased in the regenerate samples. The bulk density, the room temperature flexural strength and the strength of coating adherence all increased, while the hot flexural strength and corrosion resistance both deteriorated along with the increase of Al2O3 addition. It was because that on the one hand the low melting point phases of C4AF and C3A improved the sinterability of the regenerated samples during the burning stage, on the other hand they melted or existed in liquid phase during the experimental temperature (1573 K and 1823 K) which degraded hot flexural strength and corrosion resistance, and enhanced the strength of coating adherence as the wettability of the liquid phase. The content of Al2O3 in the regenerated magnesia-calcium brick should not be higher than 1.1 wt.%, considering its room and high-temperature performances for cement rotary kiln.\nABSTRACT\nLocalized turbulence is common in geophysical flows, where the roles of rotation and stratification are paramount. In this study, we investigate the evolution of a stratified turbulent cloud under rotation. Recognizing that a turbulent cloud is composed of vortices of varying scales and shapes, we start our investigation with a single eddy. Compared to an eddy under pure rotation, the stratified eddy shows the physical manifestation of a known potential vorticity mode, appearing as a static stable vortex. In addition, the expected shift from inertial waves to inertial-gravity waves is observed. In our numerical simulations of the turbulent cloud, carried out at a constant Rossby number over a range of Froude numbers, stratification causes columnar structures to deviate from vertical alignment. This deviation increases with increasing stratification, slowing the expansion rate of the cloud. The observed characteristics of these columnar structures are consistent with the predictions of linear theory, particularly in their tilt angles and vertical growth rates, suggesting a significant influence of inertial-gravity waves. Using Lagrangian particle tracking, we have identified regions where wave activity dominates over turbulence. In scenarios of milder stratification, these inertial-gravity waves are responsible for a significant energy transfer away from the turbulent cloud, a phenomenon that attenuates with increasing stratification.\nSubject(s)\n[Movement Disorders](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Movement Disorders\")\nABSTRACT\nHydrogels prepared from natural polymer have attracted extensive attentions in biomedical fields such as drug delivery, wound healing, and regenerative medicine due to their good biocompatibility, degradability and flexibility. This review outlines the commonly used natural polymer in hydrogel preparation, including cellulose, chitosan, collagen/gelatin, alginate, hyaluronic acid and starch. The polymeric structure and process/synthesis of natural polymers are illustrated, and natural polymer-based hydrogels including the hydrogel formation and properties are elaborated. Subsequently, the biomedical application of hydrogels based on natural polymer in drug delivery, tissue regeneration, wound healing and other biomedical field is summarized. Finally, the future perspectives of natural polymers and hydrogels based on them are discussed. For natural polymer, novel technologies such as enzymatic and biological methods are developed to improve the structural properties and the development of new natural based polymers or natural polymer derivatives with high performance is still very important and challenging. For natural polymer-based hydrogels, novel hydrogel materials, like double-network hydrogel, multifunctional composite hydrogels and hydrogel microrobots are designed to meet the advanced requirements in biomedical application, and new strategies such as dual-crosslinking, microfluidic chip, micropatterning and 3D/4D bioprinting, have been explored to fabricate advanced hydrogel materials with designed properties for biomedical application. Overall, natural polymeric hydrogels have attracted increasing interests in biomedical application, and the development of novel natural polymer-based materials and new strategies/methods for hydrogel fabrication is badly desirable and still challenging.\n[Evaluation of Drug-Induced Dysphagia Profile Using a Japanese Real-World Database: A Pharmacovigilance Study (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202309.0889.v1)\nABSTRACT\nBackground: no reports have examined the profile of drug-induced dysphagia in detail. The goal of this study was to investigate if there are any differences in the profiles of drug-induced dysphagia. Methods: This study used the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Further, reported odds ratios (RORs) were used to analyze data on adverse drug events from 2004 to 2021. The top ten drugs with the most drug-induced dysphagia occurrences were used as target drugs. The association between RORs and drug-induced dysphagia caused by the target drugs was evaluated, and the age distribution and time of onset of drug-induced dysphagia for each drug were compared. RORs were the primary endpoint. Moreover, age and time of onset of drug-induced dysphagia were secondary outcomes. Results: In total, 756,965 reports were analyzed. All the target drugs were associated with drug-induced dysphagia. Among them, cevimeline was a novel finding, as no dysphagia was observed during the clinical trial. For most drugs, the onset of drug-induced dysphagia was occurring within approximately 25 days of administration. However, even after long-term use, paroxetine and milnacipran were associated with drug-induced dysphagia. Conclusion: The onset profile of drug-induced dysphagia may differ from one drug to the next.\nSubject(s)\n[Deglutition Disorders](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Deglutition Disorders\") [Wild Oats Offer New Possibilities for Forage Because of the Higher Nutrition Content and Feed Value (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202309.0934.v1)\nABSTRACT\nTo explore the forage quality of wild oat populations under different growth environments, the basic nutrient composition and forage quality of five wild oat populations in Israel were compared. Ash, crude protein, and soluble sugar content of oats were significantly (P<0.05) related to some forage quality and possible environment of population origin. Among them, the environmental factors of origin had significant effects on the indicators of ash, crude protein, and soluble sugars of oat straw, but less on the contents of crude fat, total phosphorus, and total potassium. Meanwhile, the annual rainfall and the number of days of rainfall in the country of origin greatly influenced the cellulose content. Finally, we investigated the similarity of feeding values of different populations using PCA analysis. The results showed that, in conclusion, the higher variability of wild oat populations may be a new possibility brought by feeding oats.\n[Real-Time Monitoring of Laser-Induced Functionalisation of Transparent Conductive Oxide Films (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202309.0939.v1)\nABSTRACT\nLaser-induced functionalisation using excimer laser irradiation has been widely applied to transparent conductive oxide films. However, exploring suitable irradiation conditions is time-consuming and cost-ineffective as there are numerous routine film fabrication and analytical processes. Thus, we herein explored a real-time technique to monitor the laser-induced functionalisation of transparent conductive oxide films. We developed two types of monitoring apparatus, electrical and optical, and applied them to magnetron-sputtered Sn-doped In2O3 films grown on glass substrates and hydrogen-doped In2O3 films on glass or plastic substrates using a picosecond Nd:YAG pulsed laser. Both techniques could monitor the functionalisation from a change in properties of the films on glass substrates by laser irradiation, but electrical measurement was unsuitable for plastic samples because of a laser-induced degradation of the underlying plastic substrate, which harmed proper electrical contact. Instead, we demonstrated that the optical properties in the near-infrared region were suitable for the monitoring and the changes in the optical properties were visually detected in real-time by using a near-infrared camera.\nABSTRACT\nEffective oral care is a critical requirement to maintain high quality of life. Most oral diseases are caused by plaque (oral biofilm), which is also correlated with systemic diseases. A common method to remove biofilm is brushing teeth with a toothpaste. However, 3.5 billion people in the world have oral diseases, meaning that more efficient methods of removing biofilms are needed. We have developed a toothbrush applying bioelectric effect (BE) utilizing an electric force for biofilm removal. It demonstrated significantly higher biofilm removal efficiency than non-BE manual toothbrushes. Tests were performed in saline and toothpaste conditions using various pressure. Results showed that the BE toothbrush had a significantly higher biofilm removal efficiency in saline (0.5 N: 215.43 \u00b1 89.92 %, 2.5 N: 116.77 \u00b1 47.02 %) and in a toothpaste slurry (0.5 N: 104.96 \u00b1 98.93 %, 2.5 N: 96.23 \u00b1 35.16 %) than non-BE manual toothbrushes. Results also showed that BE toothbrushes were less dependent on toothpaste. This study suggests that the application of BE can be a new solution to plaque problems in oral care.\nSubject(s)\n[Mastocytosis, Systemic](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Mastocytosis, Systemic\") [Vanilla pompona Schiede: Morphological variation of the labellum in localities of Veracruz, Puebla, Jalisco and Oaxaca, Mexico (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202309.0894.v1)\nABSTRACT\nVanilla pompona is the third most important commercial species of the genus Vanilla, but its morphometric variation is little known. In orchids, infraspecific variation is expressed in the labellum. This study had the objective of analyzing the floral variation of V. pompona collections from localities in Veracruz, Puebla, Jalisco and Oaxaca, Mexico. During the flowering period, we obtained 55 collections of V. pompona flowers, and in the dissected labellum of each flower 54 lines and 7 angles were measured and portrayed with the ImageJ program. With the data obtained, we performed an analysis of variance, a principal components analysis, and a cluster analysis. The results showed significant differences among the collections and localities in the means of the lines of the basal, middle, and apical regions of the labellum. Also, six morphotypes were obtained, and we found that variation was associated with factors such as the environment, geographic barriers, and pollinator pressure. Moreover, we observed variation in flowering dates in one locality of Veracruz. We concluded that there is infraspecific variation within and between the collection localities of V pompona of the Atlantic region (Puebla and Veracruz) and the Pacific region (Jalisco and Oaxaca), Mexico.\nABSTRACT\nAntibody-based passive immunotherapy has been used effectively in the therapy and prophylaxis of infectious diseases. Outbreaks of the emerging viral infections from arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) represent a global public health problem due to the rapid spread and urge actions and treatment of the infected individuals to combat them. Preparedness in advance developing antivirals and studies related to the epidemiology could protect us from damages and losses. Immunotherapy based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has shown to be very specific to combat infectious diseases and several illnesses. Recent advances in the mAb discovery techniques allowed the development and approval of a wide number of therapeutic mAbs. This review focuses on the technological approaches available to select neutralizing mAbs for emerging arbovirus infections and outstanding strategies to obtain highly effective and potent mAbs. The characteristics of mAbs developed as prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agents for the dengue, Zika, chikungunya and West Nile virus are presented, as well as the protective effect verified in animal model studies.\nSubject(s)\n[Communicable Diseases](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Communicable Diseases\"), [Arbovirus Infections](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Arbovirus Infections\") [Advances in Roles of Salicylic Acid in Plant Tolerance Responses to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202309.0898.v1)\nABSTRACT\nAbstract: A multitude of biotic and abiotic stress factors do harm to plants by bringing about diseases and inhibiting normal growth and development. As an omnipotent signaling molecule, salicylic acid (SA) plays crucial roles in plants' tolerance responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses, thereby maintaining plants\u2019 normal growth and improving yields under stresses. In view of this, this paper mainly discusses the role of SA in both biotic stresses, and abiotic stresses of plants. SA regulates the expression of genes involved in defense signaling pathways, thus enhancing plants\u2019 immunity. In addition, SA mitigates the negative effects of abiotic stresses, and acts as a signaling molecule to induce the expression of stress-responsive genes and the synthesis of stress-related proteins. In addition, SA also improves certain yield-related photosynthetic indexes, thereby enhancing crop yield under stresses. On the other hand, SA acts with other signaling molecules in regulating plants\u2019 growth and improving tolerances under stresses. This paper reviews recent advances in SA\u2019s roles in plant stress tolerances, so as to provide theoretical references for further studies concerning the decryption of molecular mechanisms for SA\u2019s roles and the improvement of crop management under stresses.\nSubject(s)\n[Pneumonia, Aspiration](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Pneumonia, Aspiration\") [A Methodological Approach for Digital Twin Implementation in Waste Management: Improvement of Production and Service Systems (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202309.0899.v1)\nABSTRACT\nThe escalating environmental challenges that stem from urban residential waste in densely populated areas have become increasingly prominent in recent times. As a result, the waste management sector has experienced significant growth nationwide. However, due to the predominantly manual nature of these processes, their effectiveness falls short of meeting the current demand. Addressing these issues requires process enhancement. In this context, Industry 4.0, particularly the concept of Digital Twins, emerges as a potential avenue for refining processes. To tackle both current and future industry challenges, it is imperative to create a comprehensive methodology capable of generating effective solutions within the waste management sector. This paper provides an explanation of digital twins, outlines the methodological framework comprising an architectural structure and layered model, and details a series of sequential methodical stages for implementing digital twins based on the specific scope determined by the end-user. A noteworthy aspect is the transformative potential of digital twins in enhancing efficiency and precision within waste management practices. By providing a virtual real-time representation of the waste management system, digital twins empower simulations and experimentation to fine-tune processes. Furthermore, they facilitate informed decision-making by offering a detailed visualization of the complete system, simplifying the identification of challenges and opportunities for improvement. that this article derives from the presentation titled \"Digital Twin application methodology for the improvement of production and service systems. Application to waste management processes\" at the \"Sustainable Smart Cities and Territories International Conference\" held in the city of Manizales, Colombia, from 21st to 23rd June 2023.\n[The Issue of Extrusion and Dislocation in Titanium Middle Ear Prostheses: A Literature Review (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202309.0912.v1)\nABSTRACT\nTitanium middle ear prostheses are widely used in surgical practice due to their acoustic properties. However, they present a significant drawback shared by all synthetic materials currently in use for middle ear reconstruction: they can be rejected by the organism of the host. In this study, we aim to review the current literature on titanium TORP and PORP extrusion and dislocation. Eighty-one articles were analysed after full article review based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most common indication for reconstruction was chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. The average extrusion or dislocation rate was 5.1%, ranging from 0 to 35%. The average improvement in air-bone gap was 12.3 dB (1.6 dB to 25.1 dB) and 13.7 (-0,5 dB to 22.7 dB) for PORP ad TORP groups, respectively. The data reported on this topic are highly variable, demonstrating the functional outcomes are difficult to predict in clinical practice. We believe the current limitations could be overcome with technological developments, including bioengineering research focused on promoting the prothesis adaptation to the ME environment.\nSubject(s)\n[Cholesteatoma](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Cholesteatoma\"), [Otitis](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Otitis\")\nABSTRACT\nA quantum particle constrained between two high potential barriers provides a paradigmatic example of a system sustaining quasi bound (or resonance) states. When the system is prepared in one of such quasi bound states, the wave function approximately maintains its shape but decays in time in a nearly exponential manner radiating into the surrounding space, the lifetime being of the order of the reciprocal of the width of the resonance peak in the transmission spectrum. Naively, one could think that adding more lateral barriers would preferentially slow down or prevent the quantum decay since tunneling is expected to become less probable and because of quantum backflow induced by multiple scattering processes. However, this is not always the case and in the early stage of the dynamics quantum decay can be accelerated (rather than decelerated) by additional lateral barriers, even when the barrier heights are arbitrarily large. The decay acceleration originates from resonant tunneling effects and is associated to large deviations from an exponential decay law. We discuss such a counterintuitive phenomenon by considering the hopping dynamics of a quantum particle on a tight-binding lattice with on-site potential barriers.\nABSTRACT\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease, first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in November 2019 and has since spread worldwide, is the latest human pandemic, and has officially infected over 800 million people and has caused nearly seven million deaths to date. Although SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the large family of coronaviruses, it has some unique biological characteristics in its interplay with the human host. Therefore, this narrative review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the structure of the virus, incubation and shedding in the human host, infectivity and biological evolution over time, as well as the main mechanisms for invading human host cells and replicating within. We also proffer that ongoing epidemiological surveillance of newly emerged variants must always be accompanied by biological studies aimed at deciphering new advantageous traits that may contribute to increasing virulence and pathogenicity, such that the most appropriate strategies for establishing a (relatively) safe coexistence with the human host can be implemented.\nSubject(s)\n[COVID-19](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"COVID-19\"), [Respiratory Insufficiency](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Respiratory Insufficiency\"), [Coronavirus Infections](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Coronavirus Infections\") [Susceptibility Trends of Respiratory and Enteric Porcine Pathogens to Last Resource Antimicrobials (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202309.0891.v1)\nABSTRACT\nThe objective of the study was to analyse the antimicrobial susceptibility trends of Spanish porcine bacteria to quinolones, cephalosporins and polymyxins. Isolates of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, and Escherichia coli were isolated from sick pigs from 2019 to 2022. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was determined by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) following internationally accepted methodology. MIC categorization was based on distributing the range of MIC values in four categories being category one the most susceptible (lowest MIC value) and four the less susceptible one (highest MIC value). Moreover, clinical susceptibility (susceptible/resistant) was also determined according to CLSI and EUCAST clinical breakpoints. A logistic and multinomial logistic regression model was used to analyze the susceptibility data for dichotomized and categorized MIC data, respectively for any pair of antimicrobial/microorganism. In general terms, the antimicrobial susceptibility of pig bacteria to these antimicrobials remained stable or increased in the last four years in Spain. In the case of A. pleuropneumoniae and quinolones, it was observed a significant temporal trend where isolates from 2020 had significantly increased odds of being more susceptible than isolates from 2019. In the case of E. coli and polymyxins, a significant temporal trend was observed where isolates from 2020 and 2021 had significantly increased odds of being more susceptible than isolates from 2019 and 2020, respectively. Finally, a significant odd of being less susceptible was only observed for cephalosporins and E. coli for 2020 versus 2019, stagnating for the rest of study period. These results provide sound data on critical important antimicrobials in swine medicine.\nSubject(s)\n[Pleuropneumonia](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Pleuropneumonia\"), [Pasteurella Infections](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Pasteurella Infections\") [Retrospective Analysis of a Real-Life Use of Tixagevimab\u2013Cilgavimab Plus COVID19 Antivirals for the Treatment of Early COVID-19 (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202309.0929.v1)\nABSTRACT\nTixagevimab\u2013cilgavimab are effective for treatment of early COVID-19 among outpatients with risk factors for progression to severe illness, as well as for primary prevention and post-exposure prophylaxis. We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the hospital stay (expressed in days), prognosis, and negativity rate for COVID-19 after treatment with tixagevimab\u2013cilgavimab. We enrolled 42 patients who were nasal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 (antigenic and molecular), both vaccinated and not vaccinated for COVID-19, hospitalized at the first division of the Cotugno Hospital in Naples and who received intramuscular single dose of tixagevimab-cilgavimab (300 mg / 300 mg). All patients candidates for tixagevimab-cilgavimab had immunocompromised immune system either for chronic degenerative disorders (Group A: 27 patients) or onco-hematological diseases (Group B: 15patients). Patients enrolled in group A came to our observation after 10 days from the detection of positivity to COVID-19 unlike the other types of patients enrolled in this study. The mean stay in hospital of patients in Group A was 21\u00b15 days vs 25\u00b15 days in Group B. Twenty patients resulted negative after a median of hospitalization stay of 16 days (IQR: 18-15.25), of them 5 (25%) patients belonged to group B. Therefore, patients with active hematological malignancy had the lower negativization rate.\nSubject(s)\n[COVID-19](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"COVID-19\")\nABSTRACT\nthis paper we present approaches for generating random numbers along with potential applications. Rather than trying to provide extensive coverage of several techniques or algorithms that have appeared in the scientific literature, we focus on some representative approaches presenting their workings and properties in detail. Our goal is to delineate their strengths and weaknesses as well as their potential application domains so as the reader can judge what would be the best approach for the application in hand, possibly a combination of the available approaches. For instance, a physical source of randomness can be used for the initial seed, then suitable preprocessing can enhance its randomness and then the output of the preprocessing can feed different types of generators, e.g. a linear congruential generator, a cryptographically secure one and one based on the combination of one way hash functions and shared key cryptoalgorithms in various modes of operation. Then, if desired, the outputs of the different generators can be combined giving the final random sequence. Moreover, we present a set of practical randomness tests which can be applied on the outputs of random number generators in order to assess their randomness characteristics. In order to demonstrate the importance of unpredictable random sequences, we present an application of cryptographically secure generators in domains where unpredictability is one of the major requirements, i.e. eLotteries and cryptographic key generation.\n[Research on the Application and Performance Optimization of GPU Parallel Computing in Concrete Temperature Control Simulation (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202309.0872.v1)\nABSTRACT\nWith the development of engineering technology, engineering has higher requirements for the accuracy and the scale of simulation calculation. The computational efficiency of traditional se-rial program can not meet the requirements of engineering\u3002Therefore, reducing the calcula-tion time of temperature control simulation program has important engineering significance for real-time simulation of temperature field and stress field, and then adopting more reasona-ble temperature control and crack prevention measures. GPU parallel computing is introduced into the temperature control simulation program of massive concrete to solve this problem and the optimization is carried out. Considering factors such as GPU clock rate, number of cores, parallel overhead and Parallel Region, The improved GPU parallel algorithm analysis indicator formula is proposed. It makes up for the shortcomings of traditional formula that focus only on time. According to this formula, when there are enough threads, the parallel effect is limited by the size of the parallel domain, and when the parallel domain is large enough, the efficiency is limited by the parallel overhead and the clock rate. This paper studies the optimal Kernel execu-tion configuration. Shared Memory is utilized to improve memory access efficiency by 155%. After solving the problem of bank conflicts, an accelerate rate of 437.5x was realized in the sub-routine of the matrix transpose of the solver. The asynchronous parallel of data access and logi-cal operation is realized on GPU by using CUDA Stream , which can overlap part of the data access time. On the basis of GPU parallelism, asynchronous parallelism can double the compu-ting efficiency. Compared with the serial program, the accelerate rate of inner product matrix multiplication of the GPU asynchronous parallel program is 61.42x. This study further proposed a theoretical formula of data access overlap rate to guide the selection of the number of CUDA streams to achieve the optimal computing conditions. The GPU parallel program compiled and optimized by CUDA Fortran platform can effectively improve the computational efficiency of the simulation program for concrete temperature control, and better serve for engineering computing.\nSubject(s)\n[Memory Disorders](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Memory Disorders\")\nABSTRACT\nClimate changes challenges people\u2019s life and sustainability. Environmental problems seem to derive from human behavior. Dentistry has a high environmental footprint that needs to be controlled worldwide. Thus, the change of behavior of dentists is a necessary condition to improve the environmental situation. In this study we use a system dynamics approach to analyze pro-environmental behavior in dentists. Systemic modelling in this case, allow us to make a clear prediction of how the population of non-eco dentists will change in the future if certain factors will be affected and how much time will be needed by the system of a group of dental professionals to become eco- dentists. The ECODENT model was designed with Vensim software. It was based on the influence of WOM (word of mouth) spread of information among colleagues and stakeholders (e.g. patients, auxiliary staff and community) and other factors such as dental income, state support, CaPex and OpEx, education hours, level of urbanization and time to react. By changing each one of them we can observe the changes in the groups of non-eco and eco dentists as well as the flow of the phenomenon. It is tested that by augmenting WOM parameter, state economic support or education hours, while diminishing CaPex and OpEx, changes in pro-environmental behaviors of dentist will be reported in a shorter time. The ECODENT model can be used to further study pro-environmentalism in different dental groups and associations and design relevant eco-friendly educational programs.\nSubject(s)\n[Memory Disorders](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Memory Disorders\")\nABSTRACT\nGraphene is a two-dimensional carbon atom with a hexagonal honeycomb-like structure in which the sp2 hybridization occurs.
