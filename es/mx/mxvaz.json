This place can be bedroom, reading room, garden. Whatever you choose, keep a bottle of water with you.\n2. Wear comfortable clothes: Wear clean, loose, comfortable cotton clothing. You should also prioritize light-colored clothing to increase the feeling of lightness and comfort.\n3. Arrange the time to meditate: You can practice subconscious meditation when you wake up in the morning. You can also practice meditating before bed at night. However, you should not meditate after a meal because at this time the blood is no longer concentrated in the brain and you will not meditate effectively.\n4.

Alternatively, you can also cover a wool or cotton blanket underneath your seat for more comfort. Then, gently close your eyes.\n5. Limit meditation time: Some common times are 11 minutes, 15 minutes, 22 minutes, 31 minutes \u2026\n6. Focus on breathing: Focus your attention on your breath and slowly slow your breathing. Adjust yourself so that each inhalation and exhalation lasts about 7-8 seconds.\n7. Feel the breath: When you practice breathing, focus on how the breath moves through your body. It helps you feel more relaxed.\n8. Ending the session: End your meditation by taking a deep breath, touching your palms together or holding your hands up. Then, relax and breathe out.\n9. Gradually increase your meditation time: After a while, you will find yourself meditating gradually for longer. This is when you should gradually increase your meditation time.
