This book\nclarifies that, in the often nebulous field of natural medicine, the biological\nbases of ozone therapy are totally in line with classical biochemistry, physiological\nand pharmacological knowledge. Ozone is an oxidizing molecule, a sort of super\nactive oxygen, which, by reacting with blood components generates a number of\nchemical messengers responsible for activating crucial biological functions\nsuch as oxygen delivery, immune activation, release of hormones and induction\nof antioxidant enzymes, which is an exceptional property for correcting the\nchronic oxidative stress present in atherosclerosis, diabetes and cancer. Moreover,\nby inducing nitric oxide synthase, ozone therapy may mobilize endogenous stem\ncells, which will promote regeneration of ischemic tissues. The description\nof these phenomena offers the first comprehensive picture for understanding\nhow ozone works and why. When properly used as a real drug within therapeutic\nrange, ozone therapy does not only does not procure adverse effects but yields\na feeling of wellness. Half the book describes the value of ozone treatment\nin several diseases, particularly cutanious infection and vascular diseases\nwhere ozone really behaves as a \u201cwonder drug\u201d. The book has been\nwritten for clinical researchers, physicians and ozone therapists, but also\nfor the layman or the patient interested in this therapy.\nContent Level \u00bb Professional/practitioner\nKeywords \u00bb Anti-aging - Antioxidants - Chonic oxidative stress - Metabolic enhancers - Vasodilators\nRelated subjects \u00bb Dentistry - Human Physiology - Medical Microbiology - Medicine\nTable of Contents\nINTRODUCTION CHAPTER 1 PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF OZONE.
