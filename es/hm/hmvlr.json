The duration of this protection is not well known, is different in different individuals and for dif -\nferent variants of the virus and is not easily predictable with laboratory tests.\nData on the real impact of a supplementary or \u201cbooster\u201d \ndose in the scienti\ufb01c literature are scarce for the moment and its application in large populations such as those in the state of Israel may be associated with a decrease in the risk of new and severe episodes in the short observation period available.\nWe also lack suf\ufb01cient data on the safety and potential \nadverse effects of these supplementary doses and we do not know the ideal time to administer them in different situations.\nCorrespondence: \nEmilio Bouza Servicio de Microbiolog\u00eda Cl\u00ednica y Enfermedades Infecciosas del Hospital Gene-ral Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Universidad Complutense.

It should be noted that the vast majority of the information available at this time is that of the P\ufb01zer mRNA vaccine.\n1.- IS THERE, AT THIS TIME, A LOSS IN THE \nDURATION OF PROTECTION MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AFTER VACCINATION?\nThe ef\ufb01cacy of the different vaccines has been demon -\nstrated both in clinical trials and in post-vaccination obser-\nvational studies. However, from the beginning there has been uncertainty about the duration of protection, particularly in those subjects in whom an adequate antibody response to the vaccines was not detected. In relation to this, the need for a supplementary dose has been raised, making a speculative bal -\nance between risks and bene\ufb01ts, in some population groups. Months after the start of vaccination in some countries, da -\nta are becoming available that attempt to answer these open questions.\nIn the 5-month blinded follow-up phase of trials conduct -\ned with both the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162bm (P\ufb01z-er) vaccines, data have been reported showing an overall clin -\nical effectiveness of over 95% for severe disease and around 65% for asymptomatic disease. Ef\ufb01cacy is lower for the 65-75 age group [2]. These data extend those reported in the clinical trial with the mRNA P\ufb01zer\u2019s vaccine in which follow-up was limited to two months [3].\nAlready in real life, studies in large populations con\ufb01rm \nthe ef\ufb01cacy data found in clinical trials [4,5]. However, as ob -\nservation time progresses, there are some differences related to age groups and in some cases to disease progression. \nIn the Glatman-Freedman study [4], carried out in Israel, \nef\ufb01cacy data were obtained at 14, 21 and 28 days post-vac -\ncination follow-up. The infection rates found were very low, with an estimated ef\ufb01cacy of over 95% for overall infection, symptomatic infection, hospitalization and death. Butt et al., in the United States, report an incidence of COVID at 3 months, in vaccinated population, of 0.1% compared to 6% in the un -\nvaccinated population [5]. In Qatar, a study was conducted to determine the severity of disease in vaccinated versus unvac -\ncinated patients, including 456 cases in each group, \ufb01nding a marked reduction in severe disease in vaccinated patients, 10.1% vs. 46% [5]. Age is the main risk factor for severity which spikes in both groups above the age of 60 years. \nThe concern arises when the incidence is broken down by \nmonths post-vaccination. In a study published in July 2021 [6] 3 cohorts were analyzed corresponding to those vaccinated with mRNA-1273, with BNT162b2,3 and those not vaccinat -\ned, with a follow-up of 6 months. With both cohorts there mentalmente, las formas graves de enfermedad. La duraci\u00f3n \nde esa protecci\u00f3n no se conoce bien, es diferente en distintos individuos y para distintas variantes del virus y no es f\u00e1cil-mente predecible con pruebas de laboratorio.\nLos datos sobre el impacto real de una dosis complemen -\ntaria o \u201cbooster\u201d en la literatura cient\u00ed\ufb01ca son escasos por el momento y su aplicaci\u00f3n en grandes poblaciones como las del estado de Israel pueden asociarse a una disminuci\u00f3n del riesgo de nuevos episodios y episodios graves en el corto periodo de observaci\u00f3n disponible.\nCarecemos tambi\u00e9n de datos su\ufb01cientes sobre la seguri-\ndad y potenciales efectos adversos de estas dosis complemen -\ntarias e ignoramos el momento id\u00f3neo de administrarlas en distintas situaciones.\nEn este estado de cosas, parece prudente administrar do -\nsis complementarias a aquellos expuestos a un mayor riesgo, como pueden ser los individuos inmunodeprimidos y las per -\nsonas mayores. Por el contrario, consideramos que no es este el momento de acelerar improvisadamente una administraci\u00f3n masiva de una tercera dosis a otros grupos de poblaci\u00f3n menos expuesta y de menor riesgo, sin esperar la adecuada infor-maci\u00f3n cient\u00ed\ufb01ca, que sin duda ir\u00e1 llegando paulatinamente. \nNo creemos que esta posici\u00f3n, sea incompatible con las \nadvertencias pr\u00e1cticas y \u00e9ticas que realiza la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud a este respecto.\nPalabras clave: COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, vacunas, dosis adicionales, tercera \ndosis, booster\nINTRODUCTION\nSeveral health organizations, mainly in Western countries, \nhave recently authorized the use of a booster dose of COV -\nID-19 vaccine for previously vaccinated patients, with criteria \nthat do not always coincide. In this regard, the European Cen -\ntre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on September 1st, 2021 [1], stresses the importance of distinguishing be -\ntween booster doses and additional doses. The former (booster doses) are those administered to persons with normal immune systems, who have responded adequately to vaccination, to reestablish protection after it has decreased, and the latter (additional doses) refer to those administered to persons with weakened immune systems, who did not respond adequately to vaccination. For the sake of simplicity we will refer to both as complementary doses.\nSpain, like other countries in its environment and situa -\ntion, has authorized the use of complementary doses for cer -\ntain segments of the population.\nIn contrast to this situation is the proposal of the World \nHealth Organization (WHO), which advocates vaccinating mil -\nlions of people around the world who have not yet had the option of receiving any dose, before proceeding to the massive use of complementary doses in economically more af\ufb02uent countries.\nThe COVID Scienti\ufb01c Committee of the Illustrious College Booster or additional vaccination doses in patients vaccinated against COVID-19 A. Garc\u00eda-Botella, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 105-114 107IgG antibodies to N antigen (nucleocapsid) or S antigen \n(spicule) can now be routinely measured. Both can be posi -\ntive in persons who have been naturally infected, whereas in \nthose who have been vaccinated and have not been infect -\ned, only IgG antibodies to the S antigen will be positive [12]. The measurement of neutralizing antibodies or the cellular re -\nsponse to SARS-CoV-2 is not currently standard practice and is performed in research work or speci\ufb01c series of individuals. However, tests are being introduced that detect IgG against the RBD (Receptor Binding Domain) of the spike and whose result, due to its good correlation, could be used as a surrogate value for neutralizing antibodies determined with cell culture reference techniques [13]. \nIn the analysis of gap infections in individuals vaccinat -\ned with both doses of P\ufb01zer\u2019s vaccine and who had IgG-an -\nti S antibody data, gap infections occurred more severely in those with lower antibody rates with no signi\ufb01cant difference [14]. In addition, antibody levels were measured with two dif -\nferent techniques depending on the patient, and no common pattern could be observed when comparing the values of both techniques. In many of the patients, the values exceeded the cut-off values for positivity established by the manufacturer, resembling those that may be present in vaccinated individu-als without subsequent infection. Cases of infection have also been reported in vaccinated individuals with adequate neu -\ntralizing antibody titers [15]. In cases of reinfection, what has been demonstrated is a rapid reduction in neutralizing anti -\nbody titers prior to reinfection. [16]. \nAlthough at present, at least in Spain, a speci\ufb01c type of \nvariant (Delta variant) dominates, in the future it will be im -\nportant to clarify not only which are the antibody titers that determine the speci\ufb01c level of protection of the individual but also whether these breakthrough infections are more related to the type of variant than to the quality of the previous im -\nmune response. What is easier to af\ufb01rm, and on which there is unanimous agreement, is that the populations of immunosup-pressed individuals, patients with immunosuppressive treat -\nments, older and with worse immune response are those with the highest risk of reinfection or gap infection and in whom it will be necessary to establish priority plans for the administra -\ntion of additional doses of vaccine or with vaccines directed at new variants.\n3.- WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE U.S. FDA AND \nCDC ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF ADDITIONAL AND BOOSTER DOSES OF VACCINE?\nFollowing an initial FDA proposal, on September 24, 2021, \nthe Director of the CDC approved and adopted the recom -\nmendations of the ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices) for the administration of booster doses of the P\ufb01zer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in persons selected by age, underlying disease or population considered at high risk of ex -\nposure and infection by COVID-19 due to their professional or institutional activity [17].was a drop in disease prevention, which was 86% with mR -\nNA-1273 and 76% with BNT162b2. In the analysis performed \nby months, the \ufb01gures for disease prevention drop to 76% and 52% respectively, but the effectiveness in reducing hospital -\nization and severity is maintained. Although speculative, the authors point out that both the loss of effectiveness and the difference between vaccines could be related to the different variants, predominantly alpha at the beginning and delta in July. These results are similar to those published in October 2021 in Lancet in which the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine above the 5th month is 53% for delta variant infection and 67% for other variants, but remaining at around 90% for hospitalizations [7].\nThe loss of effectiveness, especially in the elderly, could be \ndue to the different immune response. In a cohort study com -\nparing the elderly and health care workers, both with a com-plete vaccination schedule, antibodies measured six months after immunization were signi\ufb01cantly lower in the elderly than in the health care workers [8]. The possible impact of previous infection on the occurrence of disease in vaccinated patients has also been analyzed. A large retrospective study carried out in Israel comparing 3 cohorts (vaccinated with complete regimen, unvaccinated infected and infected and vaccinated) concludes that natural immunity confers greater duration and protection against reinfection by the delta variant so that those vaccinated and not previously infected have a 5.96-fold increased risk (95% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) of reinfection, compared with the two cohorts previously infected and even greater in the group over 60 years of age [9]. \nFinally, the results obtained with the application of a \ncomplementary dose of vaccine have recently been published, which would increase the effectiveness to 90%, although the results are only at 3 weeks [10].\nIn summary, with up to 6 months of follow-up after vac -\ncination, although good protection against infection and com -\nplicated disease continues to be observed, data have emerged that point to loss of vaccine ef\ufb01cacy over time, with some dis -\ncordance in relation to severity. Although with reservations, due to the scarce evidence available, and the need to repli -\ncate results, the need for a vaccine booster is being debated, at least in the most vulnerable population. \n2.- ARE THERE RELIABLE LABORATORY MARKERS \nTO DETERMINE THE RISK OF INFECTION OR REINFECTION?\nAt present, there is no agreement on which laboratory \nmarkers can ensure or predict the risk that a person who has \nbeen vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 without having previous -\nly had COVID-19 will develop a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nor is it possible to evaluate the risk of reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated individuals who have had COVID-19 prior to vacci -\nnation. In the latter, the immune response is higher since vac -\ncination would reactivate the memory B cells, stimulating the humoral response and could generate greater protection [11].Booster or additional vaccination doses in patients vaccinated against COVID-19 A. Garc\u00eda-Botella, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 105-114 108recipients) [18]. In addition, they advised considering, as a pre-\ncautionary measure, the possibility of providing a booster dose for the elderly and frail, particularly those living in closed en -\nvironments (socio-health centers) [18]. Regarding the need for the administration of booster doses of vaccines to fully vacci -\nnated individuals in the general population, they considered that this was not an urgent decision, as the evidence available at this time regarding \u201creal world\u201d vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection shows that all licensed vaccines in the EU are highly protective against COVID-19-related hospitaliza -\ntion, severe illness and death. In this situation, they noted that the priority should be to vaccinate all those who have not yet completed their recommended vaccination course [18]. \nIn a statement dated September 2, 2021 [1], the EMA \naligned itself with the positioning of the ECDC technical re -\nport. On October 4, 2021, the EMA\u2019s Committee for Medici -\nnal Products for Human Use (CHMP), following an accelerated evaluation of the results of studies on the ef\ufb01cacy of adminis -\ntering additional doses of mRNA vaccines [19,20], both in im -\nmunocompromised adults and in vaccinated individuals with healthy immune systems, reached the following conclusions:\nAdminister an additional dose of the COVID-19 vaccines \nComirnaty (BioNTech / P\ufb01zer) and Spikevax (Moderna) to peo -\nple with severely weakened immune systems at least 28 days after the second dose. The recommendation comes after stud -\nies showed that an additional dose of these vaccines increased the ability to produce antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19 in organ transplant patients with weakened im -\nmune systems. \na) Consider a booster dose of COVID-19 Comirnaty vaccine \n(BioNTech / P\ufb01zer) at least 6 months after the second dose for persons 18 years of age or older with normal immune systems. The data evaluated show an increase in antibody levels when a booster dose is administered approximately 6 months after the second dose in persons aged 18 to 55 years.\nb) At the national level, public health agencies in EU states \nmay issue of\ufb01cial recommendations on the use of booster doses, taking into account emerging ef\ufb01cacy data and limited safety data. \nCurrently, the Committee for Medicinal Products for \nHuman Use is evaluating data to support a booster dose of Spikevax (Moderna) [20].\n5.- WHAT DOES THE WHO RECOMMEND AT THIS \nTIME REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATION OF BOOSTER DOSES TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN VACCINATED?\nIn a press release dated August 10, 2021 [21], WHO stat -\ned that \u201cIn the context of current global vaccine supply con -\nstraints, the administration of booster doses will exacerbate \ninequities by increasing demand and consuming a scarce sup -\nply, while priority populations in some countries, or subnation-al settings, have not yet received a primary vaccination series. For the time being, the goal remains to increase global vacci -It will be administered to persons who meet the de\ufb01ned \nrecommendations and who have previously received the com -\nplete vaccination with P\ufb01zer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. The \nadditional booster dose will be with the same vaccine and at least 6 months after completion of the primary vaccination.\nRecommendations to administer supplemental doses in \nthe U.S. are as follows: \n- Persons 65 years of age or older, and/or residents of \nlong-stay facilities.\n- Persons aged 50-64 years with underlying medical con -\nditions.\n- Persons aged 18-49 years with underlying medical pa -\nthology, in whom the risk-bene\ufb01t of receiving the booster dose will be assessed on an individual basis.\n- Persons aged 18-64 years with high risk of exposure and \ntransmission of COVID-19, due to work or institutional circum -\nstances may receive the \u201cbooster\u201d, individually assessing their risk-bene\ufb01t of being vaccinated.\nThe CDC justi\ufb01es the booster dose in the chosen groups \nbecause they were the \ufb01rst to be vaccinated at the beginning of the vaccination campaigns and can now bene\ufb01t from ad -\nditional protection. Given that the Delta strain is still circu-lating in the United States, the booster would help the most vulnerable population by protecting them against severe COV -\nID-19 and its complications, which are more frequent in these groups. The CDC is committed to continuing to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines so that new booster recommendations can be added in the coming weeks for other population groups and for those who have previously received the other vaccines. \nCDC Director Dr. Walensky acknowledges the great \nchallenge of making high-impact decisions when analyz -\ning very complex situations with insuf\ufb01cient and sometimes poor-quality data to make very speci\ufb01c recommendations. In a pandemic, the greatest bene\ufb01t is obtained if action is tak -\nen in anticipation of its evolution despite the uncertainty with which we have to work. \nThese are the \ufb01rst steps in the indications of the \u201cbooster\u201d, \nwhich will be completed in the near future. It is important not to forget and to insist on the need to achieve greater vaccina -\ntion coverage with complete primary vaccination in the popu -\nlation not yet vaccinated, both in the United States and in the rest of the world. \n4.- WHAT IS THE EUROPEAN POSITION, \nPARTICULARLY THAT OF THE ECDC?\nThe ECDC, bearing in mind that the primary objective of \nthe vaccination strategy is to prevent severe cases of COVID19, \nwas in favor of considering the administration of a supple -\nmental vaccine dose, as an extension of the vaccination series, to persons who may experience a limited response to the pri -\nmary COVID-19 vaccination series, such as some categories of immunocompromised individuals (e.g., solid organ transplant Booster or additional vaccination doses in patients vaccinated against COVID-19 A. Garc\u00eda-Botella, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 105-114 109recommended in the summer of 2021 the third dose for the \npopulation that had had a worse response to the vaccine (im -\nmunosuppressed) and have recently rati\ufb01ed and have pro -\nposed the extension to other risk groups and even to the gen -\neral population from the 6th month after vaccination.\nThere were not enough studies of extra doses when the \n\ufb01rst recommendations were made and we still have little ev -\nidence of increased ef\ufb01cacy in the real world, given the very short time elapsed since the beginning of the administration of \u201cthird doses\u201d and the obtaining of evolutionary data that can be analyzed beyond the titration of antibodies. \nIt occurs in both the general population [10], as in the \naforementioned immunosuppressed groups.\nSolid organ transplant recipients. The \ufb01rst information \ndemonstrating the potentiating effect of the third dose comes from series of patients with solid organ transplants [34-36] and whose review concludes that: \n- The 3rd dose of mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 in solid \norgan transplant recipients (with a high percentage of renal transplants), improves immunogenicity, reaching neutralizing antibody titers in half of the patients who did not have them after the second dose.\n- In some studies the levels achieved would correspond to \nneutralizing capacity against the virus in in vitro studies.\n- The results obtained on the activation of cellular immu -\nnity do not allow a correlation with the clinical ef\ufb01cacy of this response.\n- The existing series do not report cases of COVID-19 after \nthe 3rd dose, but the follow-up is too short to be able to verify clinical ef\ufb01cacy.\n- In solid organ transplant recipients who receive a 3rd \ndose of vaccine, there are no serious adverse side effects.\n- Objective signs of organ rejection after the 3rd dose \nhave only been reported in one heart transplant recipient, with no organ failure in the follow-up up to the date of publication.\n- The presence of neutralizing antibodies, even at low \ndoses, after the 2nd dose, predicts an enhanced response after the 3rd dose.\n- The more immunosuppressive drugs, the less response \nfrom the 3rd dose.\n- Corticosteroids, tacrolimus, mycophenolate and belata -\ncept, decrease the response to the 3rd dose and more in com -\nbination. \n- Slightly more than half of solid organ transplanted pa -\ntients do not seroconvert after the 3rd dose of vaccine.\nRenal transplant and dialysis patients. France au-\nthorized in April 2021, the additional doses for renal patients (transplanted or on dialysis), their series were brought forward to add knowledge of the response in this group [37-39] and their conclusions are: \n- The third dose in renal transplant patients and in dia -nation coverage with the primary series (one or two doses for \ncurrent vaccines).\u201d\nFurthermore, WHO adds that \u201cthe introduction of supple -\nmentary doses should be strongly evidence-based and target-ed to the population groups most in need. The rationale for booster doses should be guided by evidence of decreased vac -\ncine ef\ufb01cacy, in particular decreased protection against severe disease in the general population or in high-risk populations, or due to a coronavirus variant of concern. To date, evidence remains limited and inconclusive on the widespread need for booster doses following a primary vaccination series. WHO is carefully monitoring the situation and will continue to work closely with countries to obtain the necessary data for policy recommendations.\nOn September 11, 2021, Katherine 0\u2019Brien, director of \nWHO\u2019s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biological Medicines, rati\ufb01es this same position in a statement on the Or -\nganization\u2019s own website [22]. \nFinally, Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO\u2019s Health \nEmergencies Programme, during a live question and answer session broadcast on September 22, 2021 on the Organization\u2019s social media channels [23] said what WHO is advocating is that booster doses in the general population, who have had broad access to vaccines and have already been vaccinated, are not the best option at this time. However, Ryan indicated that WHO is not against giving a third dose to people who may have signif -\nicant bene\ufb01t, such as the elderly, the medically vulnerable, and anyone who needs an immune system booster after a full reg -\nimen of COVID-19 vaccines. Dr. Ryan understands that this is compatible with giving the primary vaccine series to everyone in the world who needs it because there is enough vaccine. \n6.- WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDATION AND \nEXPECTED EFFICACY OF COMPLEMENTARY VACCINE DOSES IN IMMUNOSUPPRESSED PATIENTS?\nIt seems to be demonstrated that, in general, COVID-19 \nis more severe, more prolonged, with a greater possibility of \nmaintaining a high viral load for a longer period of time and, therefore, with a greater capacity for transmission in the im -\nmunocompromised population. [24-28].\nLikewise, the humoral response to vaccines and in particular \nto those available against COVID-19, is lower in immunocom -\npromised patients, both in primary de\ufb01ciencies and in those as -\nsociated with infectious and autoimmune diseases. [14, 29-31], as well as in oncology patients and notably more evident in cer -\ntain tumor and treatment subgroups. [14, 29, 32, 33]. \nThe \u201cbooster\u201d effect of the antibody level response with \nthe second dose of the vaccine and with vaccination after the infection has passed is also certain.\nDue to this foreseeable immunogenic potentiation of ad -\nditional doses to the standard vaccination, the CDC and then other global health agencies were ahead of the evidence and Booster or additional vaccination doses in patients vaccinated against COVID-19 A. Garc\u00eda-Botella, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 105-114 110patients in certain countries versus achieving a complete vac -\ncination schedule in the unvaccinated population worldwide, \na certain debate has been established [46]. Most institutional \npositions recommend the administration of the booster dose \nin certain vulnerable populations (immunocompromised, el -\nderly, nursing homes) but not to the entire population in a comprehensive manner, for which there would not be as much \nevidence or urgency to do so. Regardless of the relevance of a \nbooster campaign, this situation may generate an ethical de -\nbate, balancing the national and international responsibilities \nof the states [47]. The WHO already states that this situation \nmay increase the inequality of access to vaccines in the differ-\nent countries of the world, where there are still countries such \nas the African continent where the complete vaccination rate is around 3%. Thus, although there are cosmopolitan positions that consider a global strategy to defeat the pandemic (re -\nduction of transmission and possibility of new variants) to be \npragmatic, the reality is that countries have adopted national \npolicy strategies in the absence of a consensus. This national -\nism as a strategy would be based on the investment of local \nresources and public funds in vaccine research and the con-\ncept of protecting their population as much as possible. The question is whether the booster dose in certain countries is \nreally an opportunity cost for the poorest countries or wheth -\ner there are other barriers beyond vaccine shortages that pre-\nvent vaccines from reaching the unvaccinated population [46]. Thus, increasing global access to vaccination should be a prior -\nity for all states, while seeking to improve the evidence of the effectiveness of a booster dose in certain populations. \nPerhaps it is not a matter of choosing between one op-\ntion or another, but rather of seeking alternatives that favor \nglobal vaccination aimed at solving certain issues such as the loss of the cold chain, the possibility of heterologous vacci -\nnation or local production together with compliance with the \nestablished distribution agreements through programs such \nas COVAX, which have not met their expectations at present \n[48]. The objective would be to reduce inequity in the poorest \ncountries, while maintaining the national commitment of the \nrichest countries in the development of vaccines and promot -\ning their distribution in an international framework.\n9.- WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF VACCINATION AS \nA COVID-19 PREVENTION TOOL? WILL PERIODIC VACCINATION WITH THE COVID VACCINE BE NECESSARY?\nThe need for repeat supplemental doses of the COVID vac -\ncine depends on whether the pandemic evolves into an endemic \nform of infection, such as in\ufb02uenza. This is the future scenar -\nio that is considered most likely, both because of the evolution of previous pandemics and because of the existence of many conditions that make it easier for the virus not to be eradicat-\ned. Even with the best progress in vaccination, it seems likely that reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 may remain in both unvaccinated \npopulations and animals, as is the case with other coronaviruses. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to mutate makes it possible for more lyzed patients, increases the immunogenic response, although \nmore than 50% of complete vaccine non-responders remain non-seroconverted.\n- The higher the immunosuppressive treatment load, the \nlower the humoral response. In dialyzed patients it is signi\ufb01cant in those receiving immunosuppressants for myeloma or amyloidosis.\n- There are no serious adverse side effects.\nOther cohorts of patients with immunosuppression \nand booster doses. There are no analyzable series, for the mo -\nment, of 3rd dose or additional dose to the standard vaccine in \npatients under immunosuppressive treatment of patients with autoimmune diseases or other types of oncologic patients (sol -\nid organ or hematologic) different to those already mentioned. Neither in patients under immunotherapy, a group in which the safety of the vaccine was especially valued due to initial suspicions of the possibility of potentiation of adverse effects.\nOnly the sum of particular actions in this group are availa -\nble without alarm bells ringing in the updated literature [40, 41]. \n7.- WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE INDICATION \nAND EFFICACY OF BOOSTER DOSES OF NON-mRNA VACCINES?\nExisting information on the ef\ufb01cacy of additional doses \nof vaccines other than mRNA vaccines is still very scarce. The \navailable data refer mainly to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Two studies, not yet published, have been carried out with this vaccine. The \ufb01rst phase 3 study (ENSEMBLE-2) is a dou-ble-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and ef\ufb01cacy of a two-dose regimen of the vaccine administered at an interval of 56 days to adults over 18 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19 [42, 43]. After a median follow-up of 36 days, a second dose was shown to achieve 100% (CI, 33%-100%) protection against severe/critical COVID-19 at least 14 days after the \ufb01nal vaccination, 76% (55%-88%) against symptomatic COVID-19 globally, and 94% (58%-100%) against symptomatic COVID-19 in the United States. The sec -\nond dose of vaccine was generally well tolerated [44]. In the second study, the second dose was administered 6 months af -\nter the \ufb01rst dose. In this case, a 9-fold increase in antibody levels was observed at 1 week after administration and in -\ncreased up to 12-fold at 4 weeks. By comparison, when the second dose was administered two months after the \ufb01rst dose, antibody levels had risen 4 to 6-fold [45]. The data are not yet published and approval for the administration of the booster dose of this vaccine has not yet been received.\n8.- IS THERE REALLY A CONFLICT IN THE USE \nOF BOOSTER DOSES OF VACCINES IN HIGHLY DEVELOPED NATIONS VERSUS LESS FAVORED ONES?\nIn view of the dilemma that could arise regarding the \nadministration of a supplementary dose to fully vaccinated Booster or additional vaccination doses in patients vaccinated against COVID-19 A. Garc\u00eda-Botella, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 105-114 111We do not believe that this position is incompatible with \nthe practical and ethical warnings issued by the World Health \nOrganization. The arrival of vaccines in the world with a low prevalence of vaccinated people should be compatible with the additional doses needed in countries of the economical -\nly richer world. It should not be forgotten that the arrival of vaccines to millions of disadvantaged human beings who have not received them so far depends not only on the will or gen -\nerosity of the nations that possess them. We are aware that there are political, economic, logistical and technical factors that can make the best will to help and solidarity of some hu -\nman beings with others fail.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.- More than six months after the application of the \ufb01rst \nvaccines against COVID, a high level of protection is main-tained, particularly against severe forms of the disease. \n2.- Vaccine failures are detected, however, particularly in \npatients with severe immunosuppression such as solid organ transplant recipients.\n3.- Current routine laboratory markers do not allow de-\n\ufb01nitive detection of the most exposed vaccinated population. \n4.- Both North American and European health authori -\nties admit, in the absence of very solid data on their ef\ufb01cacy, the administration of complementary doses for the most vul-nerable population, the de\ufb01nition of these populations being somewhat diffuse and rapidly changing.\n5.- Third doses are currently approved or in the process of \nbeing approved for at-risk populations, including those select-ed on the simple criterion of being over a certain age.\n6.- The WHO, while not frankly opposing this trend, \npoints to the need to vaccinate \ufb01rst those populations of the world that have not yet had access to the vaccine on a mas -\nsive scale.\n7.- There are very few studies that evaluate the potential \nadverse effects of receiving a complementary dose of vaccine in large segments of the population, but some health author -\nities point to the need to \u201cgo ahead\u201d of the pandemic and in -\ncrease, accepting the uncertainty, the degree of immunization of the population.\n9.- This Scienti\ufb01c Committee of COVID, of ICOMEM, sup -\nports the attitude of administering a third dose (complemen -\ntary dose) to particularly vulnerable population groups but wishes to express the necessary caution when extending this recommendation indiscriminately to large population groups until more studies on both the ef\ufb01cacy and safety of this med -\nical practice are available.\n10.- We consider that getting the necessary vaccines to \nthe world that needs them is not only a decision of solidarity, but that it runs up against logistical and political problems that cannot always be solved from a purely technical point of view.transmissible and vaccine-resistant variants to emerge, making \nit possible that a multivalent vaccine covering several SARS-CoV-2 strains may be required in the future. The possibility of an endemic infection will also depend on a possible waning of acquired immunity against the virus and its variants, something we will only know in the long term. If this is the case, the time when epidemic peaks are expected to occur will coincide with the in\ufb02uenza season, as the cold conditions less time outdoors \nand more personal contact. This makes it possible for both vacci -\nnation campaigns to coincide [49-51].\n10.- WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE COVID \nSCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE OF ICOMEM ON THE ISSUE OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF SUPPLEMENTARY DOSES OF VACCINES TO THE SPANISH POPULATION?\nThe ef\ufb01cacy of the vaccines administered to date is be -\nyond doubt and they have managed to reduce, fundamental -\nly, severe forms of disease, those requiring hospital admis -\nsion, ICU admissions and deaths due to COVID-19. However, \nthe vaccines administered to date do not totally prevent the acquisition of viral infection and transmission to third par -\nties. The duration of this protection is not well known and it happens to be different in different individuals and for different variants of the virus. In any case, at present, pro -\ntection cannot be \ufb01rmly deduced from tests such as the de -\ntermination of antibody titers or other immunological deter -\nminations.\nThere are breakthrough infections in vaccinees and rein -\nfections in patients who have already had a primary episode of COVID, some of them severe and fatal. \nData on the real impact of a complementary or \u201cbooster\u201d \ndose are scarce in the scienti\ufb01c literature. An additional dose may induce the appearance of antibodies for example in up to 50% of solid organ transplant patients who had not responded adequately to previous vaccination and booster doses in large populations such as those in the state of Israel may be associ-ated with a decreased risk of new and severe episodes in the short observation period available.\nOn the other hand, data on the safety and potential ad -\nverse effects in vaccinated individuals when exposed to a new dose are limited and even less on the ideal timing of adminis -\ntration in different situations.\nIn this state of affairs, it seems prudent to administer sup -\nplementary doses to those exposed to a higher risk, such as immunocompromised individuals and the elderly, particularly among those most at risk because they live in health care fa -\ncilities.\nOn the contrary, we consider that this is not the time to \nimprovise a massive administration of a third dose to oth -\ner population groups less exposed and at lower risk, without waiting for adequate scienti\ufb01c information, which will un -\ndoubtedly arrive gradually.

The development of vaccines has not prevented, during the whole period of the pandemic, the constant search for therapeutic medicines, both among ex -\nisting drugs with different indications and in the development of new drugs. The Scienti\ufb01c Committee of the COVID-19 of the Illustrious College of Physicians of Madrid wanted to offer an early, simpli\ufb01ed and critical approach to these new drugs, to new developments in immunotherapy and to what has been learned from the immune response modulators already known and which have proven effective against the virus, in order to help understand the current situation.\nKeywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, treatment, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, \nMolnupiravir, PF-07321332, Paxlovid, convalescent plasma, Sotrovi -\nmab, Banlanivimab, Etesevimab, Casirivimab, Imdevinab, AZD7442, Ciganilmab, Tixagevimab, Evusheld, BRII-196, BRII-198, Dexametha -\nsone, Corticosteroids, Tocilizumab, Sarilumab, Anakinra, Canakinu-mab, Baricitinib, Tofacitinib, Ruxolitinib, Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Infliximab, Etanercept, Golimumab, Itolizumab, Ravulizumab, Le -\nmilumab, Ivermectin, Colchicine, Vitamin D, Metformin, Fluvoxamine, Azithromycin, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir.\nCorrespondence: \nEmilio BouzaServicio de Microbiolog\u00eda Cl\u00ednica y Enfermedades Infecciosas del Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Universidad Complutense.

In this \ufb01rst \ntrial, no clinical bene\ufb01ts were obtained, but a trend towards improvement was observed when treatment was started ear-ly. [12]. Negative results were also found within the Solidarity study in which 405 hospitals in 30 countries participated. A total of 11,330 patients were included in different groups, of whom 2,750 were assigned to remdesivir. No improvement in clinical outcome or mortality was observed in this study [13]. In the multi-center DisCoVeRy study, which included more than 800 patients [14] no clear bene\ufb01t was demonstrated either. However, in the ACTT-1 study, with more than 1,200 randomized patients, a more rapid clinical improvement was demonstrated in patients receiving remdesivir versus placebo and even a reduction in all-cause mortality. This trial led to FDA approval of the drug [15]. \nIn a meta-analysis that included 5 randomized, place-\nbo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 13,594 patients, those treated with remdesivir showed a more rapid clinical improvement and a reduction in the number of days of hospi -\ntalization. The differences in mortality were not signi\ufb01cant, al -\nthough there was a trend in that direction in the 5-day treat -\nment studies [5]. \nIn an observational study carried out in Spain at the Hos -\npital Cl\u00ednico de Barcelona, the use of remdesivir improved sur-vival, with greater ef\ufb01cacy in patients who received treatment earlier, with a total reduction in the risk of death of 62% [16]. Other studies showed similar results, such that treated patients had less need for mechanical ventilation and lower mortality [17,18]. \nRemdesivir is therefore included as an effective drug in \nguidelines such as that of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases (SEIMC), indicated for patients in severe but not crit -\nical condition, with less than ten days of evolution. Similarly, the IDSA recommends remdesivir in hospitalized patients but not in critically ill patients [19,20].\nRecent studies have shown a decrease in the combined \nendpoint of COVID-related hospitalization and all-cause death of 87% in outpatients at high risk of progression treated for 3 days with remdesivir [21].\nFavipiravir is a nucleoside, prodrug, antiviral, broad-spec -\ntrum, RNA-dependent, RNA polymerase-dependent antiviral drug that has already been used in the treatment of in\ufb02uenza and studied against SARS-CoV-2, preferably in Japan and oth-er Asian countries [22].\nIt has been compared, in small studies, with drugs whose \nineffectiveness has been proven a posteriori, without showing signi\ufb01cant differences. Such is the case with hydroxychloro-quine [23], lopinovir/ritonavir [24] , inhaled \u00df interferon [25] and with baloxavir [26] . \nFinally, in a randomized, open-label, phase 3 study in \ncases of mild or moderate COVID, again with few cases (150 patients), a comparison was made with standard treatment, without the study allowing, in our opinion, any clear conclu -\nsion to be drawn [27].INTRODUCTION\nWith the achievement of useful vaccines against COV-\nID-19, whose ef\ufb01cacy is extraordinarily high but not absolute, \nand in view of the possibility that new variants of the virus may limit its ef\ufb01cacy, it is pertinent to turn our attention from the preventive to the therapeutic sphere. In addition, there is \nstill a large number of unvaccinated persons. In the case of \nchildren aged 5 to 11 years, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved the Comirnaty vaccine on 25 November 2021 [1]. \nThe treatments against the disease are beginning to bear \nobjective and signi\ufb01cant fruit both in the \ufb01eld of direct antivi -\nral therapy and in that of anti-in\ufb02ammatory and immunother -\napeutic treatment. A good example of this is the repositioning of monoclonal antibodies or the presentation of new effective antiviral agents that can be administered orally. \nThe Scienti\ufb01c Committee of COVID-19, of the Illustrious \nCollege of Physicians of Madrid (ICOMEM) has received and has been asked several questions about the present reality of the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19, to which the group has tried to give answers, after deliberation and consensus. \nThis document is not intended to be an exhaustive review \nof the state of the art of pharmacological treatment of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, but rather to offer a current, summarized and easily understandable perspective that in-cludes the situation in Spain.\nIn the following pages we have compiled the scienti\ufb01c ev -\nidence that we have been able to collect, also providing the opinion of the ICOMEM working group. \n1. \nSOME CLINICALLY EFFECTIVE ANTIVIRALS \nAGAINST COVID-19\nIn a disease of viral etiology, with some very aggressive \nand rapidly evolving forms, it is logical that drug treatments \nwith antiviral activity began to be used early and, to a certain extent, indiscriminately, from the onset of the pandemic. We will con\ufb01ne ourselves here to listing those that have shown some ef\ufb01cacy in clinical trials or that seem very promising in this respect.\nRemdesivir is a prodrug in monophosphate form that is \nmetabolized to active adenosine triphosphate. It inhibits the replication of several families of RNA viruses, including coro -\nnaviruses. This drug had been studied against Ebola and Mar -\nburg viruses and clinical trials in SARS-CoV-2 infection started early [2-9]. Preclinical data showed that early treatment could decrease viral load, reduce lung damage and improve survival.\nTo date, although the drug has been approved for severe \npatients by the FDA and EMA, the results cannot be consid -\nered uniformly conclusive as some clinical trials have shown discordant results [5-11]. The \ufb01rst randomized, placebo-con -\ntrolled, phase III clinical trial with remdesivir was published in 2020. It included 237 patients, with severe disease and O\n2Pharmacological treatment of COVID-19: an opinion paper A. Garc\u00eda-Lled\u00f3, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 115-130 117Since the primary host immune response appears 10 to 14 \ndays after infection, plasma should be collected from donors no earlier than the second or third week after SARS-CoV-2 in-fection [43].\nPlasma would provide passive immunity based on anti -\nbodies and therefore could reduce both the severity and du -\nration of the disease, so it could be indicated in hospitalized patients and with special interest in immunosuppressed pa -\ntients with de\ufb01cient antibody production. As a human blood product it can cause the same reactions as transfusions (aller -\ngic and anaphylactic reactions, hemolysis, \ufb02uid overload, etc.), but studies consistently show that plasma transfusion is safe with effects similar to those of ordinary transfusions [44-51]. \nHowever, despite the justi\ufb01cation for its use, the experi -\nence in other viral epidemics and its safety, there are still no clear results in terms of ef\ufb01cacy. It began to be used in mod -\nerate-severe COVID-19 with publication of observational stud-ies and clinical trials [46-48], with systematic review and me-ta-analysis [45,46], which have provided inconclusive results. Furthermore, these trials were heterogeneous with respect to the characteristics of the convalescent plasma used (e.g. in terms of antibody content and strati\ufb01cation of recipient pa -\ntients according to their serological status). \nGiven these \ufb01ndings, the FDA argued that a \u201ctotality of \nevidence\u201d suggested that the bene\ufb01ts of convalescent plasma would outweigh its risks and, given the lack of effective treat -\nments, granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and provided guidance on the manufacture and use of convales -\ncent plasma in hospitalized patients with signs of progressive infection [44]. \nOutside the U.S., a randomized, open-label, controlled \nclinical trial in 27 hospitals in Spain is worth mentioning [49] in which no differences were obtained in terms of overall mor -\ntality (11.7% in the treated group vs. 16.4% in the control group, p = 0.205), nor in terms of progression at 14 days. The PLACID study, carried out in India [50], also failed to demon -\nstrate a decrease in disease progression and mortality. In sum -\nmary, at the present time, convalescent plasma is not a treat -\nment approved by the European Medicines Agency and even uncontrolled compassionate use of this procedure should be discouraged.\n3. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES USABLE IN \nMONOTHERAPY\nThe world of monoclonal antibodies and the data on their \nactivity have had a very important boost recently and we con -\nsider them to be an area of great interest. In this section we \nwill discuss sotrovimab, which is indicated for monotherapy.\nSotrovimab. It is a recombinant engineered humanized \nmonoclonal antibody (IgG) that binds with high af\ufb01nity to a highly conserved epitope in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (spike) of SARSCoV-2. Its exact mechanism of action is not well understood, but it appears to prevent fusion For all these reasons, in our opinion, this drug does not yet \nhave a study that establishes a clear ef\ufb01cacy and must still be \nconsidered among the experimental drugs [28, 29].\nMolnupiravir, an orally administered drug, has recently \nbeen approved at least in the United Kingdom and the United States for use in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. It is a prodrug with activity against RNA viruses. Preclinical animal studies have shown ef\ufb01cacy, with a broader spectrum than even remdesivir, and Phase I human clinical trials have shown good levels of safety [30]. A phase II clinical trial has proven its ef\ufb01cacy in terms of viral clearance at 7 days [31], including pharyngeal clearance of viruses.\nPreliminary data from Phase III studies have revealed a \nsigni\ufb01cant reduction in the rate of disease progression, hos -\npitalizations, need for ICU and death in the group of patients starting with mild or moderate disease. In contrast, no signi\ufb01 -\ncant results are obtained in patients with advanced and severe disease [32]. \nReaders interested in more information on this new drug \ncan \ufb01nd it in the following references [33-39].\nPF-07321332 (Paxlovid\n\u00ae, P\ufb01zer), is a ritonavir-boosted \nprotease inhibitor that would reduce the risk of hospitalization or death in 90% of subjects with mild to moderate disease. \nPF -07321332 targets the major protease (Mpro) of SARS-\nCOV-2 that processes the two polyproteins through at least 11 cleavage sites. The amino acid sequence and three-dimen -\nsional structure of Mpro are highly conserved across the Coro -\nnavirinae subfamily, providing a strong basis for the design of therapeutics to target potentially immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants [40,41].\nP\ufb01zer has just announced at a press conference that its \nproduct Paxlovid\n\u00ae (PF-07321332 + ritonavir) reduces the risk of \nhospitalization or death by 89%, compared to placebo, in adults not hospitalized but at high risk of poor outcome at the con -\nclusion of its EPIC study (Phase 2/3). The data will be submitted to the U.S. FDA for emergency use authorization (EUA) as soon as possible [42]. In patients treated within 3 days of symptom onset (primary endpoint); 0.8% of patients receiving Paxlovid\n\u00ae\nrequired hospitalization in the \ufb01rst 28 days (3/389 hospitalized, no deaths), compared to 7.0% of patients receiving placebo (27/385 hospitalized with 7 subsequent deaths). The primary analysis of the interim dataset evaluated 1,219 adults enrolled through September 29, 2021. At the time the decision was made to discontinue patient recruitment, enrollment was at 70% of the planned 3,000 patients. Treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable between Paxlovid\n\u00ae (19%) and placebo (21%), \nmost of which were mild in intensity.\n2. CONVALESCENT PLASMA AND IV \nIMMUNOGLOBULINS\nImmunoglobulins and convalescent plasma (CP) is ob -\ntained from persons who have recovered from COVID-19. Pharmacological treatment of COVID-19: an opinion paper A. Garc\u00eda-Lled\u00f3, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 115-130 118con\ufb01rmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the combination led \nto a lower incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death from any cause on day 29 and accelerated the decline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load [58].\nIn the trial (BLAZE-1), the mean decrease in SARS-CoV-2 \nviral load at day 11, the primary endpoint, was signi\ufb01cantly greater with bamlanivimab plus etesevimab than with place -\nbo. Hospitalization for COVID-19 or death from any cause at day 29 occurred signi\ufb01cantly less frequently with the antibody combination than with placebo (2.1% vs. 6.6%; HR 0.32; NNT 22.5). No deaths occurred in the antibody group, compared with 10 in the placebo group [59]. \nIn a second trial (BLAZE-4), the FDA selected 700 mg/1400 \nmg as the licensed dose for use of bamlanivimab and etese -\nvimab together, prompting the manufacturer to study this dose in a new cohort (BLAZE-1.5). The rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 or death from any cause at day 29 was signif -\nicantly lower with the antibodies than with placebo (0.8% vs. 5.4%; HR 0.13; NNT 21.5). \nBamlanivimab and etesevimab should be administered as \nsoon as possible after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and within 10 days of the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Patients should be treated in a facility staffed and equipped for the management of anaphylaxis and should be monitored for hy -\npersensitivity reactions during drug administration and for at least 1 hour after completion of the infusion.\nIn March 2021, the Committee for Human Medicinal Prod -\nucts (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), began the ongoing review procedure of the results of studies with bamlanivimab and etesevimab, for the treatment of con\ufb01rmed COVID-19. The review ended without issuing the conclusions, once the company Eli Lilly Netherlands BV, the marketer of the two molecules, informed the Agency on October 29, 2021 that it was withdrawing from the process [60]. In its letter notifying the Agency of the withdrawal, the company stated that it was withdrawing because EMA required prospective concurrent validation data that could only be generated through the pro -\nduction of new batches of active substance and that it was not in a position to generate such additional data.\nThis product has been withdrawn from the evaluation \nprocess in Europe.\nCasirivimab + imdevimab. Regeneron\u2019s monoclo-\nnal antibodies casirivimab (REGN10933) and imdevimab (REGN10987) are cleared for use together.\nThe FDA has cleared this combination of monoclonal an -\ntibodies to SARS-COV-2 on an emergency basis (REGEN-COV) for co-administration by intravenous or subcutaneous injec -\ntion for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in in-dividuals over 12 years of age and weighing no less than 40 kg who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 [61,62]. Traditional risk groups would also include overweight patients or pregnant women, as well as those suffering from cardiovascular disease, hypertension or chronic respiratory dis-ease (Table 1) [61,63,64].after the virus binds to the human angiotensin 2-converting \nenzyme receptor (ACE\n2). \nInterim results from the COMET-IC (Early Treatment of \nCOVID-19 in Outpatients) Phase II clinical trial were published in October 2021 [52]. This multicenter, double-blind trial eval -\nuated the clinical course after administration of a single intra -\nvenous infusion of sotrovimab in 291 adult patients diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 (Sat O2 \u2265 94% on room air), \nnot hospitalized, within the \ufb01rst 5 days of symptom progres -\nsion versus a placebo group of 292 infected. Patients included in the trial were 18 years of age or older and were at high risk for progression of COVID-19 because of their age (\u2265 55 years) \nor because they had at least one risk factor for progression to severe disease [52]. The primary ef\ufb01cacy outcome was hospital -\nization (for > 24 hours) for any cause or death within 29 days after randomization. The use of sotrovimab was associated with an 85% reduction in the relative risk of progression to severe or critical illness and up to a 79% reduction in the risk of all-cause hospitalization or death through day 29. In addition, no safety issues were identi\ufb01ed that compromised treatment [52].\nIn May 2021, the FDA authorized the emergency use of \nsotrovimab in the US [53]. In Europe, it is part of the Euro -\npean Commission\u2019s portfolio of promising treatments against COVID-19 [54]. In May 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued its positive opinion on the drug, following review of data from the interim analysis of data from the Phase III Comet-ICE study [55] and will be studied by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for possible authorization. \nThe COMET study demonstrated that intramuscular ad -\nministration of sotrovimab is not inferior and offers similar ef\ufb01cacy to the intravenous formulation in a population at high risk of poor outcome. IM administration may facilitate its ad -\nministration in primary care.\n4. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES USED IN \nCOMBINATION\nBamlanivimab + etesevimab. In November 2020, the \nIgG1 neutralizing monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab (LY-\nCoV555; Lilly) received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA for the treatment of newly diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients 12 years of age and older, body weight equal or superior to 40 kg, in good baseline condition but at high risk for progression to severe disease or requiring hospitalization [56]. \nSubsequently, in April 2021 the FDA revoked the US clear -\nance of the monotherapy, due to the progressive increase of COVID-19 cases in the US caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants re-sistant to such monotherapy [57].\nThis revocation did not affect the combined use of bam-\nlanivimab and etesevimab, which maintained its indication for emergency use. In a phase 3 clinical trial comparing single in -\ntravenous administration of the combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab versus placebo within 3 days of laboratory Pharmacological treatment of COVID-19: an opinion paper A. Garc\u00eda-Lled\u00f3, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 115-130 119omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 1,505 healthy, \nunvaccinated patients aged \u226512 years with no evidence of prior immunity who were household contacts of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive test within the previous 96 hours). Patients received a single subcutaneous dose of casiriv -\nimab and imdevimab (600 mg each) or placebo. Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection within 4 weeks of randomization was signi\ufb01cantly lower in patients who received the antibodies than in those who received placebo (1.5% vs. 7.8%). Among patients who developed symptomatic infection, the duration of symp-toms was signi\ufb01cantly shorter in the antibody group (mean 1.2 vs. 3.2 weeks with placebo). There were no hospitalizations or emergency department visits due to COVID-19 in the antibody group compared to 4 in the placebo group [70].\nAZD7442: Cilgavimab (AZD1061) + Tixagevimab \n(AZD8895) (Evusheld). AZD7442 is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies from Astra Zeneca, AZD8895 (tixa -\ngevimab), a long-acting agent, and AZD1061 (cilgavimab), which simultaneously bind to distinct non-overlapping epitopes in the protein S receptor binding domain to neutral-ize SARS-CoV-2. Both form a complex with the receptor bind -\ning domain (RBD) and have strong neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and variants with antigenic substitutions at the RBD [71]. \nThey are currently being evaluated for single-dose ad -\nministration (intramuscular or intravenous) to treat or prevent COVID-19. Preliminary results in treatment suggest a decrease in severity in patients. Applied to both pre-exposure and post-exposure prevention, the results of the studies are sched -\nuled for completion in June 2022 [72]. \nPreliminary results of the preventive treatment have been \nreported by Astra Zeneca, announcing that AZD-7442 failed to improve outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 post-exposure prophy-laxis. On the contrary, in pre-exposure prophylaxis, the study suggests its ef\ufb01cacy in reducing the risk of developing symp -\ntomatic COVID-19 by 77%. Protection could be maintained for up to 12 months.\nCombination of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies \nBRII-196 and BRII-198. BRII-196 and BRII-198 are noncom -\npetitive anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies. They reduce virus binding to the receptor and their structure allows for a long half-life of activity, according to data from a study (AC -\nTIV-2), sponsored by NIAID and led by the ACTG.\nA study evaluates the safety/ef\ufb01cacy of investigation -\nal agents for the treatment of non-hospitalized adults with mild-moderate COVID-19 under a randomized, blinded, con -\ntrolled, adaptive platform. BRII-196/BRII-198 (1,000 mg each) is administered as single doses in sequential infusions to pa-tients at high risk for clinical progression (i.e., age \u2265 60 years or \npresence of other medical conditions) within 10 days of symp-tom onset and after positive test for SARS-CoV-2. The primary endpoint was hospitalization and/or death through day 28. \nBetween January and July 2021, 837 participants (418 \nactive, 419 placebo) in various nations were randomized and In contrast, this combination could worsen the results if \nadministered to patients hospitalized for COVID-19 or requir -\ning high-\ufb02ow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. \nThe mechanism of action is based on the fact that ca -\nsirivimab and imdevimab bind to different sites of the recep -\ntor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, blocking \nits binding to the human ACE2 receptor.\nFDA clearance was based on interim Phase 1/2 results \nfrom a double-blind trial (COV-2067) in which 799 outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 were randomized in a blind -\ned fashion to receive a single intravenous infusion of mono -\nclonals or placebo. Outcomes were assessed 28 days after in -\nfusion [64] and viral load at day 7 was signi\ufb01cantly lower with the monoclonal combination than with placebo. There was al -\nso less need for hospitalization, emergency department visit or teleconsultation within 28 days after infusion (2.8% vs. 6.5%). Among patients at higher risk of disease progression, rates of poor outcome were 3% with casirivimab and imdevimab and 9% with placebo. The combination is protective against vari -\nants of concern known to date [65].\nSubsequent data in Phase 3 studies (COV-2067), in which \n3,867 patients with mild or moderate COVID and at least one risk factor for progression to severe disease were randomized prompted the FDA to change the licensed dose of casirivimab and imdevimab from 1200 mg to 600 mg of each antibody [64,66].\nWe are not aware of studies comparing this combination \nwith other monoclonal antibody combinations. Anaphylaxis reactions have occasionally been detected with this combina -\ntion, although they are very rare [64].\nIf intravenous infusion is not feasible and would result in \na delay in treatment, casirivimab and imdevimab can be ad -\nministered subcutaneously. The licensed dose is 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab administered in four consecutive 2.5-ml injections (2 injections of each antibody packaged separately, or 4 injections of the co-formulated for -\nmulation) at different sites on the thigh, back of the arm, or abdomen (except 5 cm around the umbilicus). If a prepared syringe cannot be used immediately after dilution, it can be refrigerated or left at room temperature for up to 4 hours. If refrigerated, the syringe should remain at room temperature for 20 minutes before administration.\nCasirivimab and imdevimab should be administered in a \nfacility staffed and equipped to manage anaphylaxis. Patients should be monitored for hypersensitivity reactions for at least 1 hour after antibody administration.\nThe combination of casirivimab and imdevimab has been \nadministered with good tolerance to pregnant women [67].\nIn May 2021, the FDA has extended clearance for the use \nof the combination of casirivimab and imdevimab to post-ex -\nposure prophylaxis in high-risk individuals if they are not fully vaccinated or if they have a poor immune response to the vac -\ncine [68, 69].\nThis indication expansion is based on the results of a rand -Pharmacological treatment of COVID-19: an opinion paper A. Garc\u00eda-Lled\u00f3, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 115-130 120related to hyperglycemia and hypernatremia [79] , as well as \nwith new episodes of septic shock, invasive fungal infections, Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection in endemic areas, and gastrointestinal bleeding. As of April 2021, 42 clinical trials of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19 patients were ongoing and 16 had been completed but not published, possibly increasing the evidence available in the immediate future [79].\nThe use of corticosteroids in persistent COVID-19 intersti -\ntial lung disease has shown bene\ufb01ts in some observational se -\nries but clinical trials are needed to con\ufb01rm these results [80].\n6. OTHER IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUGS\nCytokine production in response to viral replication plays \nan important role in lung damage, in the need for mechan -\nical ventilation and, globally, in the survival of patients with COVID-19. This has prompted research into the ef\ufb01cacy of im -\nmunomodulatory drugs that limit cytokine-associated effects. The demonstration of the bene\ufb01cial effects of corticosteroids in patients with severe pneumonia reinforces anti-in\ufb02amma -\ntory/immunomodulatory therapy as a way to address severe disease.\nThe immunomodulatory drugs investigated are grouped \ninto several families according to their mechanism of action (Table1). Of these, only a few have suf\ufb01cient data to be able to make a judgment on their use in COVID-19. received study product at the time when emerging variants \nwere circulating. In the interim analysis, the BRII-196/BRII-198 combination had fewer hospitalizations (12 vs. 45) and deaths (1 vs. 9 AZD7442) compared to placebo. Grade 3 or higher ad-verse events (AEs) were observed less frequently among partic -\nipants on BRII-196/BRII-198 than on placebo (3.8% vs. 13.4%), with no serious infusion or other reactions.\nThus, the BRII-196/BRII-198 combination appears safe, \nwell tolerated, and demonstrated a signi\ufb01cant reduction com -\npared to placebo in the risk of hospitalization and/or death among adults with mild-moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression to severe disease [73].\n5. THE ROLE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS IN THE \nTREATMENT OF SEVERE COVID-19\nThe use of dexamethasone is recommended in critical -\nly ill patients with COVID 19 who require oxygen therapy or \nventilatory support. The recommended dose is 6 mg daily for 10 days or until hospital discharge. Comparison of dexameth -\nasone 12 mg daily versus 6 mg has shown no difference in the results regarding ef\ufb01cacy (survival without life support at 28 days) and safety in the most critically ill patients [74]. If dexa -\nmethasone is not available, other glucocorticoids at equivalent doses (total daily doses of hydrocortisone 160 mg, methyl -\nprednisolone 32 mg or prednisone 40 mg) may be considered, although the data supporting the use of these alternatives are more limited than those for dexamethasone [75-77]. In con -\ntrast, the use of dexamethasone (or other glucocorticoids) is not recommended for the prevention or treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 (patients not receiving oxygen). \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) [77] has established \ntwo recommendations regarding the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients: \n1. Administration of systemic corticosteroids in prefer -\nence to no administration for the treatment of severe and crit -\nically ill patients (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence).\n2.  Refraining from the use of corticosteroids in the \ntreatment of non-critically ill COVID-19 patients (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence). \nThis guideline is based on a reduction in 28-day mortality \nof 8.7% and 6.7% in critically or severely ill COVID-19 patients. In addition, systemic corticosteroids probably reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation [77]. The oxygen saturation threshold of 90% for the de\ufb01nition of severe COVID 19 is con -\nsidered arbitrary and is recommended to be adjusted to the patient\u2019s baseline situation.\nThe main study supporting these recommendations is Re -\ncovery [78] which shows a reduction in 28-day mortality in patients with COVID 19 with mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%) or oxygen therapy (23.3% vs. 26.2%) but not in pa -\ntients without respiratory support (17.8% vs. 14.0%).

The elevation of some plasma markers may help to make the decision. Elevated IL-6 and CRP have been shown to be suitable markers to identify patients who bene\ufb01t from tocilizumab, suPAR has been shown to iden -\ntify patients who bene\ufb01t from anakinra. It is also not known whether the association of more than one of these immuno-modulatory drugs adds any advantage to the isolated admin -\nistration of each of them. The target on which they act is dif -\nferent, which could determine synergism with potentiation of the bene\ufb01ts. \n7. KNOWN DRUGS WITH OTHER INDICATIONS \nUNDER EVALUATION FOR COVID-19\nIvermectin. Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasit -\nic agent that has been shown to be effective against SARS-\nCoV-2 in vitro [100]. Ivermectin is approved in some countries for the treatment of parasitic infections, but not for COVID-19. In particular, the World Health Organization does not recom -\nmend the use of this drug except in the context of a clinical trial [101] and other studies advise against its use [102-104].\nColchicine. Colchicine is a potent agent that inhibits \nmultiple proin\ufb02ammatory pathways, so it was thought that it could be useful in the control of the in\ufb02ammatory complica -\ntions of COVID-19. Colchicine is approved in some countries, such as Spain, for the treatment of gout and familial Medi -\nterranean fever, but not for COVID-19, as it is considered that there is insuf\ufb01cient evidence of its usefulness, and it al -\nso has signi\ufb01cant adverse effects, especially gastrointestinal. [105,106]. Therefore, it can only be used for the treatment of COVID-19 within a clinical trial.\nVitamin D. Vitamin D supplementation has been associat -\ned with lower risk of acute respiratory infections, such as in\ufb02u -\nenza [100]. However, there are insuf\ufb01cient data to recommend or reject the use of vitamin D for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 [107]. A Cochrane review found a large heteroge-neity of studies on this vitamin in the treatment of COVID-19, due to the different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D level of the participants and the results found [108]. It is noteworthy that one of the \ufb01rst clues to the potential usefulness of vitamin D in COVID-19 was a pilot randomized controlled trial conducted in Spain, which observed that high-dose calcifediol reduces the need for intensive care unit treat -\nment in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [109].\nMetformin. Metformin is a \ufb01rst-line treatment for type \n2 diabetes, but it has also shown some ef\ufb01cacy in infectious diseases, such as in\ufb02uenza and hepatitis C. In a July 2021 re -\nview, 4 observational studies were identi\ufb01ed that showed a reduction in mortality among people using metformin on an outpatient basis [110]. However, the evidence is insuf\ufb01cient to recommend the use of this drug to reduce COVID-19-associat-ed mortality [111].The drugs whose clinical trials and observational studies \nhave shown results that make their use worth considering are \ngrouped into three families: IL-6 inhibitors, IL-1 antagonists and JAK inhibitors. \nThe most widely evaluated IL-6 inhibitor is tocilizumab. \nInitial results from observational studies were very encourag -\ning, but were not always followed by similar results in clinical trials. The registry clinical trials (COVACTA, EMPACTA) failed to show bene\ufb01t in patients with severe pneumonia, including pa-tients requiring ICU admission or mechanical ventilation [81-85]. Some subsequent clinical trials showed that tocilizumab administration in patients with severe pneumonia is associated with a signi\ufb01cant decrease in mortality and organ support-free time. [86-88]. Signi\ufb01cantly, the RECOVERY study showed that tocilizumab was effective in reducing mortality in patients with in\ufb02ammation data (CRP >75 mg/L in this study) [89], similar to some observational studies [90,91]. Of particular importance was that the bene\ufb01ts of tocilizumab were felt even when the patient was receiving steroids. The positive results of these clin -\nical trials have led most COVID-19 treatment guidelines to in -\nclude it as an option in patients with severe pneumonia, espe -\ncially if they have elevated markers of in\ufb02ammation. Sarilumab is another IL-6 inhibitor that has been evaluated in clinical tri -\nals. The number of patients treated does not allow conclusions to be drawn and, at this time, it is recommended for use only in patients who for whatever reason cannot receive tocilizumab.\nAmong the JAK inhibitors, baricitinib and tofacitinib have \nobtained positive results in clinical trials. Both drugs have shown a decrease in progression to mechanical ventilation and mortality, independent of concomitant steroid use [92-95]. \nFinally, an IL-1 inhibitor, anakinra, has also shown bene -\n\ufb01cial effects on clinical progression and mortality in patients with severe pneumonia [96-98]. In a double-blind clinical trial, the drug demonstrated bene\ufb01t especially in patients who had elevated suPAR levels (>6 ng/mL), a marker of severity in pa -\ntients with COVID-19 [99]. \nThere is no doubt that the group of drugs we are discuss -\ning have a role in the treatment of patients with severe COV -\nID-19 pneumonia. It should be noted that, in a recent review, baricitinib and tofacitinib were included, along with dexameth -\nasone and tocilizumab, as the drugs that had demonstrated a decrease in COVID-19-associated mortality in randomized clin -\nical trials [95].\nIt is possible that anakinra could be added to this list. The \ntiming of administration also seems to be well established. It should not be administered during the early stages of the disease, when antiviral drugs are preferentially indicated, and should be reserved for patients requiring oxygen therapy. Both dexamethasone and tocilizumab could also be administered in patients requiring mechanical ventilation or ECMO. Both JAK inhibitors and IL-6 inhibitors can and should be administered in conjunction with dexamethasone in patients in whom they are indicated.\nSome doubts remain to be resolved. No comparative stud-\nies have been carried out between the different options and Pharmacological treatment of COVID-19: an opinion paper A. Garc\u00eda-Lled\u00f3, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 115-130 122prolongation was also not statistically signi\ufb01cant compared to \nprevious studies [119].\nLopinavir/ritonavir is used for the treatment of human \nimmunode\ufb01ciency virus (HIV-1). It was thought to be a po -\ntential treatment for SARS-COV-2, and was shown in vitro \nto achieve inhibition of several respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-1, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [120, 121]. However, the scienti\ufb01c evidence does not support its clinical use in COVID-19. A systematic review and me -\nta-analysis evaluating the effects of lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with other therapies do not report positive clinical effects [120]. Nor have larger clinical trials (RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY) demonstrated a reduction in mortality, initi -\nation of invasive mechanical ventilation, or duration of hos-pitalization with this therapy. Adverse events were reported more frequently for lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 84) compared to both other antivirals and placebo [120].\nIn conclusion, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, azithro -\nmycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir although they have been widely used, are currently discarded for the treatment of COVID, since after large studies with large populations they have not shown bene\ufb01t.\n9. PECULIARITIES OF THE USE OF ANTI-COVID \nDRUGS IN PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN\nIn the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario, both wom-\nen of childbearing age and pregnant women are a very large \npopulation at risk for SARS-COV-2 infection [122]. The situa -\ntion of physiological immunotolerance of pregnancy seems to increase the risk of infection and serious complications [123], and there are more obstetric complications and higher rates of prematurity [124, 125].\nThe multiple safety barriers to include pregnant women \nin clinical trials, and the physiological changes of pregnancy, make it dif\ufb01cult to study new drugs in this population group [126-128]. \nWe could summarize the drugs used for COVID in preg-\nnant women in 3 groups [127] :\n1.- Drugs that have not demonstrated ef\ufb01cacy against \nCOVID-19, as listed in another section of this document, in -\ncluding hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, Colchicine and Azithromycin.\n2.- Drugs prohibited in pregnancy due to toxicity and ter -\natogenic effect already known: thalidomide, and hypotensive drugs that act at the level of the renin angiotensin system and affect fetal renal development.\n3.- New drugs, immunomodulators, with little knowledge \nin pregnant women. Among them are: tocilizumab. There is lit -\ntle experience with the use of tocilizumab in pregnant women with rheumatic disease and experts only recommend it if the bene\ufb01t outweighs the potential risks [126]. \nBeta Interferon, a cytokine of the interferon family with Fluvoxamine. Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant drug (se -\nlective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and \u25a1-1 receptor agonist) \nthat also has certain anti-in\ufb02ammatory and possibly antiviral effects. On October 27, 2021, the results of the TOGETHER trial, which is the largest randomized trial to date (741 patients on \ufb02uvoxamine and 756 on placebo) to evaluate the effectiveness of this drug in symptomatic patients with COVID-19 at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 in Brazil, were published on October 27, 2021 [112]. Compared to those treated with placebo, patients with \ufb02uvoxamine (100 mg twice a day for 10 days) reduced by 38% the frequency of hospitalization, de -\n\ufb01ned as a stay of more than 6 hours in a COVID-19 emergency device or transfer to a tertiary hospital due to COVID-19. These results are very encouraging because of the high ef\ufb01cacy of the treatment, and because it is oral and very low cost, but they need to be replicated in new studies.\n8. DRUGS DISCARDED AFTER PROVING \nINEFFECTIVENESS\nAmong the drugs that have been massively used and have \nnow been shown to be ineffective, we would like to highlight \nhydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. We will now detail what motivated their use and why they are no longer in use. \nHydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are drugs ap -\nproved for the treatment of lupus erythematosus, rheu -\nmatoid arthritis and malaria. They were among the \ufb01rst treatments used at the beginning of the pandemic. Hydrox -\nychloroquine was thought to be more effective due to the results of in vitro experiments and pharmacokinetic models. However, published studies do not indicate that they have antiviral ef\ufb01cacy, nor do they improve clinical course or mor -\ntality. Neither the Solidarity clinical trial (CT) [113], nor Re -\ncovery [114], have shown bene\ufb01t. The pooled relative risk of mortality from these trials was 1.11, 95% CI 0.99-1.24, with no apparent bene\ufb01t in both ventilated and nonventilated patients. This CI excludes any bene\ufb01t of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients. These trials also do not demonstrate excess mortality in relation to the use of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients [113,114].\nAzithromycin has, in addition to its bacteriostatic activity, \nan immunomodulatory, anti-in\ufb02ammatory, and antiviral effect [115,116]. It can also improve patients with respiratory distress syndrome [117, 118]. Based on these facts, it has been used empirically in patients with COVID, especially in moderate-se -\nvere cases. Its use has also been justi\ufb01ed with the intention of reducing bacterial superinfection in critically ill patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all types of clinical studies (including 17 papers) found no clinical improvement in patients with COVID-19 [119]. No statistically signi\ufb01cant dif -\nferences were found in the rate of mortality, mechanical ven -\ntilation or hospital admission between the control group and the group treated with azithromycin. In terms of safety, the use of this macrolide has a relatively safe pro\ufb01le. The risk of QT Pharmacological treatment of COVID-19: an opinion paper A.

It should be treated by a multidisciplinary team, which assesses the need or not for immunomodulatory treat -\nment [142]. \n10. CURRENT REGULATORY SITUATION OF DRUGS \nFOR PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 IN SPAIN\nRemdesivir is currently the only speci\ufb01c drug against COV -\nID-19 approved by the AEMPS. It is indicated for treatment in \nadults and adolescents with pneumonia requiring supplemen -\ntal oxygen [143].\nSecondly, dexamethasone is another drug widely used in \nthe treatment of COVID-19 and fully available in Spain [144].\nThe use of immunomodulators has become widespread, \nespecially in patients at higher risk of poor outcome and in the in\ufb02ammatory phase of the disease. The drugs used are approved for marketing in Spain, but in entities other than COVID-19. The most widely used are tocilizumab, authorized for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and cytokine re -\nlease syndrome associated with treatment with CART (im -\nmunocellular therapy); Anakinra, authorized in rheumatoid arthritis, cryopyrin-associated syndromes, familial Mediterra -\nnean fever and Still\u2019s disease; and baricitinib, authorized in rheumatoid arthritis, moderate to severe, and atopic derma-titis. Regarding monoclonal antibodies, sotrovimab and the combination of casirivimab and imdevimab can be prescribed in our country for off-label indications. The European Med -\nicines Agency (EMA) concluded that these monoclonal an -\ntibodies can be used to treat con\ufb01rmed COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years or older and weighing at least 40 kg) who do not require supplemental oxygen therapy and who are at risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 [145,146].\nThe European Commission has granted marketing au-\nthorization for Ronapreve\u00ae (casirivimab and imdevimab) for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg) who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of worsen -\ning their disease, as well as for the prevention of COVID-19 in people aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg (pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis). This decision comes one day after the positive opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), demonstrating the priority of the EMA and the European Commission to reduce review times for safe, effective antiviral antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activi -\nty, used in the treatment of maternal multiple sclerosis, has \nbeen proposed for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19 but there are no recommendations for use in COVID-19 in -\nfected pregnant women. Remdesivir has insuf\ufb01cient experi -\nence in pregnant women. Finally, other drugs not speci\ufb01cally anti-COVID-19 used in the management of pregnant women such as \ufb02uorinated glucocorticoids (betamethasone or dexa-methasone), used for fetal lung maturation if indicated, and methyl prednisolone and dexamethasone have been evaluat -\ned in prospective studies and have demonstrated ef\ufb01cacy in the treatment of severe maternal SARS-COV2 infection [125].\nIt is essential to remember the need to include pregnant \nwomen in clinical trials in order to have data that allow the use of already available and future drugs with safety and cer -\ntainty of effectiveness, without having to do it in compassion -\nate use or by extrapolation of data obtained in other popula -\ntion groups, or used with other indications [126].\nSARS-COV-2 infection in children accounts for 10% of re -\nported cases of COVID-19. [129, 130]. Although the majority of infected children do not require speci\ufb01c treatment for the virus, it should be remembered that between 4 and 8% may require admission to the ICU [131-138]. \nRegarding treatment of COVID-19 in children, there are \nno data from large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, and there are few observational studies to provide suf -\n\ufb01cient information to dictate treatment recommendations for COVID-19 in the pediatric population. The NIH Clinical Guide -\nlines for treatment of COVID-19 contain speci\ufb01c recommenda-tions and considerations for pediatric populations as dictated by an Expert Panel on the subject [139]. \nIn summary:\nRemdesivir is FDA cleared for the treatment of COVID-19 \nin children over 12 years of age, weighing more than 40kg. \nAlso available on an emergency basis FDA (USA) for treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized young children weighing between 3.5 kg and 40 kg, or under 12 years of age weighing more than 3.5 kg. [140]. \nDexamethasone is recommended by an Expert Panel in \nhospitalized children with COVID-19 who require high-\ufb02ow oxygen therapy, noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventila -\ntion, or extracorporeal oxygenation (ECMO) (BIII). In contrast, it is not recommended in children who require little supple -\nmental oxygen (nasal goggles). \n3.- With monoclonal antibodies there is insuf\ufb01cient evi -\ndence for the recommendation or rejection of the use of this medication in children [141].\n4.-COVID-19 convalescent plasma: Not recommend -\ned in hospitalized children on COVID-19, who do not require mechanical ventilation, unless administered in the course of a clinical trial (AIII). It is also not recommended for use in hos -\npitalized children hospitalized with COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation (AIII). There are insuf\ufb01cient data on ef\ufb01cacy and safety.

By re -\nviewing data as they become available, the CHMP may issue an opinion on the drug\u2019s premarketing authorization.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.- Remdesivir, molnupiravir and PF-07321332 (Paxlovid) \nare three antivirals with different mechanisms of action that have demonstrated ef\ufb01cacy in clinical trials in different mark -\ners of disease progression.\n2.- At present, and after many published data, convales -\ncent plasma cannot be considered a therapy of established ef-\ufb01cacy in patients with COVID in any of their clinical situations.\n3.- There are monoclonal antibodies, both marketed and \nin the process of being marketed, which, when administered early in the natural course of the disease, decrease progression to severe forms. \n4.- Some monoclonal antibodies under investigation \ncould, if their ef\ufb01cacy is demonstrated, be administered pre-ventively and with long-term action.\n5.- The role of dexamethasone in severe patients with \nCOVID-19 is well established. The alternative position of oth -\ner corticosteroids in equivalent doses is less clear. There is no indication for administration of dexamethasone in less severe situations.\n6.- There are other immunomodulatory drugs with differ-\nent targets of action that already have indications in patients with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure.\n7.- Of the drugs already known with other indications, \n\ufb02uvoxamine seems especially promising in the treatment of COVID-19.\n8.- Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and the anti-HIV \ncombination of lopinavir and ritonavir have been shown to be ineffective in different studies and have no place in the cur -\nrent treatment of COVID-19.\n9.- Studies on ef\ufb01cacy, safety and tolerance in pregnant \nwomen and children of any of the above drugs are limited.\n10.- At the time of writing, only remdesivir is approved in \nSpain by the AEMPS, in the antiviral group. Some monoclonal antibodies are available on a compassionate use basis and im -\nmune response modi\ufb01ers are available off-label.\nFUNDING\nNone to declare \nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST \nThe authors declare no con\ufb02icts of interestPharmacological treatment of COVID-19: an opinion paper A.

A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 132There are probably many milestones in the history of HIV \ninfection since its discovery, but I would highlight the follow -\ning 12:\n1.On June 5th, 1981, the CDC alerted of the occurrence of 5 \ncases of Pneumocystis carinii (now P. jirovecii) pneumo-\nnia in previously healthy homosexual men, associated with \nCMV disease or infection and suggesting that it was due to an immunode\ufb01ciency whose cause was not yet known [1-4]. \n2. In 1984, French researchers on the one hand and US re -\nsearchers on the other - with controversy over the claim to \ufb01rst discovery - isolated a virus they called HTLVIII (US) or \nLAV (France), later uni\ufb01ed as HIV, as the cause of the so-called acquired immunode\ufb01ciency syndrome (AIDS). This \nlandmark \ufb01nding made it possible,months later, to detect the presence of antibodies to the virus through serological \ntests that were immediately widely used to diagnose HIV infection in people who had contracted the virus [5-13]. \n3.In the 1980s, the knowledge that famous personalities\nfrom the world of art and sport (Rock Hudson, Freddy Mer -\ncury, Magic Johnson, etc.) had been infected with HIV was important in drawing attention to a growing pandemic and demonstrating that it did not only affect marginalised groups in society [14].\n4. In 1987, the \ufb01rst antiretroviral drug, AZT (azidothymidine \nor zidovudine), was marketed in Spain, with the capacity to partially and temporarily inhibit HIV replication, demon -\nstrating in a randomised, double-blind clinical trial that patients receiving this treatment had a signi\ufb01cantly longer survival (although the difference was only months). AZT also had considerable toxicity, but it was the \ufb01rst thera -\npeutic step in the \ufb01ght against HIV [14, 15].\n5. In 1994, study 076 was the \ufb01rst to demonstrate that ef-\nfective antiretroviral treatment (ART) was able to prevent vertical transmission of HIV in pregnant women . This \nrandomised, double-blind clinical trial showed a 76% re -\nduction of infection in newborns of women taking AZT dur -\ning pregnancy versus placebo[16].\n6. In 1996, coinciding with the International AIDS Confer -\nence in Vancouver, it was shown that a three-drug reg-\nimen of ART - two nucleoside analogues and a protease \ninhibitor - was able to persistently inhibit HIV replication and at least partially restore immunity as assessed by CD4 count and CD4/CD8 ratio [17].\n7.That same year, we were able to start assessing the response to ART in our hospital laboratories by measuring plasma \nviral load, which allowed us to know within a few weeks whether or not the treatment was being effective[18].  In \n2005, the \ufb01rst scienti\ufb01c evidence of the preventive ef\ufb01-\ncacy of suppressive ART on sexual transmission of HIVin serodiscordant heterosexual couples was presented [19].\n8. In 2007, the \ufb01rst triple-ART regimen (TDF/FTC/EFV) was \nmarketed in Spain in a single tablet to be administered once a day [20]. It was the beginning of a phase that was moderna de asumir un reto de esta magnitud y de transformar, \ngracias al tratamiento antirretroviral, una enfermedad mayor -\nitariamente letal en una enfermedad cr\u00f3nica, compatible con una vida personal y de relaci\u00f3n pr\u00e1cticamente normales.

While it is one of \nhumanity\u2019s greatest tragedies, it is at the same time one of its \ngreatest successes in scienti\ufb01c development and research. What was achieved was unimaginable 4 decades ago: to turn a pro-foundly immunosuppressive disease into a chronic infection where a latent virus allows, under very tolerable medication, a state almost close to normality. The research effort has been enormous, but the results are extraordinary.\nOn the other hand, the failure to eradicate the disease, the \nfailure to produce a vaccine and the problems of social injustice that still persist around HIV infection still leave room for im -\nprovement.\nIt therefore seems appropriate to undertake a process of re -\n\ufb02ection on where we are after almost four decades and where we want to be in the not-too-distant future. This re\ufb02ection can only be complete if it is carried out from a multidisciplinary per -\nspective that includes the points of view of the different actors involved in the problem.\nFor this reason, the Health Sciences Foundation convened a \nlarge group of people from different backgrounds to try to pro -\nvide answers to a series of questions that society is asking about the past and future of HIV infection. The questions posed were accepted by the group as relevant and assigned to a speaker who presented his or her point of view and data for discussion with the group. \nWe now turn to the questions, the rationale underpinning \nthe answer and the conclusions on each point.\nAS WE APPROACH THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF \nTHE BEGINNING OF THE HIV EPIDEMIC, WHAT MAJOR HISTORICAL MILESTONES WOULD YOU HIGHLIGHT?\nDaniel PodzamczerPast and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 133antiretroviral treatment (ART). New prevention measures, \nthe ef\ufb01cacy of current ART and the absence of trans-mission in virologically suppressed individuals will help to reduce the incidence of infection, as well as its social stigma, pending a cure. \nWHAT IS THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE \nEPIDEMIC IN FIGURES?\nBel\u00e9n Alejos \nAccording to the latest UNAIDS report, 37.9 million peo -\nple were living with HIV infection globally in 2018. Of them, \n79% of people living with HIV knew their HIV status (i.e. about 8.1 million people did not know they were living with HIV). In terms of access to antiretroviral treatment, 23.3 million peo -\nple had access to antiretroviral therapy, up from 7.7 million in 2010. Consequently, there has been a steady decline from the number of new infections to 1.7 million new HIV infections in 2018 [28]. \nIn the WHO European Region, which includes Europe and \nCentral Asia, 159,420 new diagnoses were recorded in 2017, corresponding to a rate of 20.0 new diagnoses per 100,000 people. As has been observed over the last decade, most of these cases were recorded in the eastern region (82%), fol-lowed by the western region (14%) and the central region (4%). The current HIV epidemic varies greatly by geographical area. Epidemics in the central and eastern regions account for the majority of cases, and the most frequent mode of trans-mission is heterosexual practices followed by injection drug use. In contrast, in the western part of Europe, sex between men was the most common mode of transmission [27]. Overall, the rate of new HIV diagnoses increased by 37% from 2008 to 2017 across the WHO European Region, but there are also different patterns by geographical area. While a 27% decrease in the rate of new diagnoses is observed in the western region, rates continue to increase in the eastern and central regions (68% and 121% respectively). In addition, diagnostic delay re -\nmains very high in all regions and more than half of new diag -\nnoses were late presenters (CD4 < 350 cells/\u00b5L). \nIn Spain, it is estimated that there are currently between \n140,000 and 170,000 people living with HIV, which represents a prevalence of 0.4%. According to data from the epidemio -\nlogical surveillance report on HIV/AIDS in Spain, 3,381 new HIV diagnoses were recorded in 2017, giving a rate of 8.82 cases per 100,000 inhabitants after correcting for delayed reporting [29]. This rate is similar to other countries in the WHO Euro -\npean region, but higher than the average for EU and Western European countries. In comparison with the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), we ob -\nserve in Spain a higher percentage of diagnoses in men (84.6% versus 75.1%) and a lower percentage in people over 50 years of age (14.8% versus 19.3%). The most frequent mode of transmission is men who have sex with men (54.3%), followed by heterosexual (28.2%) and injection drug users (3.1%) [30].\nThe time trend in the rate of new diagnoses in Spain in followed in the next decade by the marketing of several \none-pill-a-day formulations of effective, well-tolerated and easy-to-take drugs, some of them based on a high ge-\nnetic barrier integrase inhibitor; drugs now considered preferred drugs for ART initiation [21]. This has contributed signi\ufb01cantly to transforming HIV infection into a chronic disease with a survival similar to the general population in patients who start ART early in the course of infection - and with an excellent quality of life. The \ufb01rst long-term \nART with an INI - Cabotegravir - and an NNRTI - Rilpi -\nvirine - will soon be marketed, allowing patients who are considered good candidates to receive intramuscular in-\njections every 2 months instead of taking daily pills, which may have bene\ufb01ts on adherence, quality of life and stigma for HIV-infected people [22].\n9. In 2009, the \ufb01rst data were released on the so-called \u201cBer-\nlin patient\u201d, the \ufb01rst HIV-infected adult to be assumed to have been cleared of the virus - and therefore cured \n- following a bone marrow transplant for treatment of leu -\nkaemia refractory to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This transplant was from a donor with the delta 32 mutation \nof the CCR5 co-receptor of CD4 cells, which has long been known to confer immunity of CD4 cells to HIV, which is unable to infect them [23].\n10.In 2011, the HPTN052 study showed that early ART initia -\ntion in serodiscordant couples reduced HIV transmission by 96%. These data were key to the widespread recommenda-tion for early initiation of ART regardless of CD4 count [24].\n11.In 2012, the FDA approved pre-exposure prophylaxis \n(PrEP), the administration of a daily TDF/FTC regimen to patients at high risk of HIV infection due to sexual practic -\nes. This approval was based on several international clinical trials of thousands of participants - men who have sex with men, women and heterosexual men - which showed that such treatment was able to reduce the proportion of people acquiring sexually transmitted infections by 40-86%, de -\npending on the study, provided adherence was acceptable. The preventive bene\ufb01ts of PrEP, which has been shown to be cost-effective, were seen in the following years in the signi\ufb01cant decrease in the incidence of new HIV infections in cities or countries where its use was authorised [25]. In November 2019, PrEP was approved and included in the National Health System\u2019s service portfolio.\n12.Data from the PARTNER 1 and 2 studies demonstrating the absence of sexual transmission of HIV from ART-infected \nindividuals with undetectable plasma viral loads were pub -\nlished in 2016 and 2019 . Undoubtedly these important \ndata (summarised in the I=I expression (undetectable=un -\ntransmissible; undetectable=untransmittable\u201d, or \u201cU=U\u201d) can contribute to reducing the stigma and psychological problems associated with HIV infection [25-27].\nConclusion:\nAfter 40 years, HIV infection has changed from being \na fatal disease, in the vast majority of cases, to a chronic \ninfection, with an excellent quality of life for people on Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 134ment coverage could achieve an approximate 40% reduction \nin annual HIV incidence globally [33]. However, it should be borne in mind that in countries such as Spain, where access to treatment is universal and the fraction undiagnosed is low, the improvement that would be achieved in reaching the UNAIDS targets on incidence reduction would not be as great as in other countries where the prevalence of HIV infection is higher [34].\nTo the question posed here, \u201cIs it possible to eradicate \nHIV?\u201d, the answer from a public health point of view is clearly, no. When we talk about HIV eradication, we can \ufb01nd a clin -\nical concept, which would be the cure of the individual, i.e. the complete eradication of the virus from a patient\u2019s body. On the other hand, eradication, as an epidemiological or pub-lic health concept, at the population level, is de\ufb01ned as the complete elimination of the disease-causing agent from the natural environment (not from controlled laboratories). In any case, HIV eradication is not a goal that we can set as achiev -\nable in a short period of time. In the case of complete cure of the individual, we know that even with the highly effective antiretroviral therapy available to us, and even if the subject has an undetectable viral load, there remains a low level of viral replication and cellular reservoirs that contribute to HIV persistence and make HIV infection a chronic disease [33]. To achieve eradication at the population level, curative treatment and preventive vaccines should be available and affordable for the entire world population. \nWe can, however, speak of elimination and control in \nsome areas with regard to HIV infection. Disease elimination refers to the complete cessation of the incidence of cases in a given geographical area or population subgroup. For HIV infec -\ntion this has been achieved for blood transfusion-associated transmission and mother-to-child transmission[35]. But unlike eradication, in the case of elimination, as the causative agent is still present in the natural environment, we must maintain the preventive and intervention measures that led to the elim-ination of the disease. \nThe primary prevention measures that allowed us to reach \nthis level have been HIV testing of all blood donors and mon -\nitoring of pregnant women - HIV testing during pregnancy, antiretroviral treatment of pregnant HIV-infected women and newborns, and formula feeding of newborns. While there may still be cases of vertical transmission of HIV, these cases must be examined to identify where prevention systems and policies have failed to ensure universal access to prevention methods. \nThere are other primary prevention measures (aimed \nat preventing the onset of infection) that can be taken de -\npending on the environment in which we \ufb01nd ourselves [33], harm reduction programmes for injecting drug users (syringe exchange, supervised consumption rooms, methadone treat -\nment) [36], PrEP [36-38] and male circumcision in certain con-\ntexts[39]. All these measures that we can apply to reduce sex -\nual transmission of the virus and the acquisition of infection through injection drug use are aimed at infection control, i.e. reducing the incidence, prevalence or mortality of cases in a the period 2009-2017 is downward, however different pat -\nterns are observed depending on the mode of transmission. In \nthe groups of injection drug users and heterosexual practices, a steady decline is observed throughout the period for both males and females. Whilst in the group of men who have sex with men a downward trend is observed only from 2015 on -\nwards, although disaggregated by origin this decrease is only observed in Spanish MSM. Although late diagnosis has de -\ncreased slightly since 2009, it is still very high; in 2017 47.8% of HIV diagnoses were made late (CD4 < 350 cells/\u00b5L). \nThe 90-90-90 targets set by UNAIDS are that by 2020 \nat least 90% of people living with HIV should be diagnosed; at least 90% of diagnosed people should be on antiretroviral treatment; and at least 90% of people on antiretroviral treat -\nment should have an undetectable viral load. Overall, this would mean that at least 73% of people living with HIV have an undetectable viral load. Modelling suggests that achieving these targets by 2020 would mean ending the epidemic by 2030. \nThe Spanish \ufb01gures on the 90-90-90 strategy have been \nprovided by the HIV and Risk Behaviour Surveillance Unit [31]. Of the 146,500 people living with HIV in Spain, 86.2% knew their HIV diagnosis, 93.4% were receiving antiretroviral treat -\nment, and of those on treatment, 90.4% had reached an un -\ndetectable viral load. Although we are above the EU/ EEA aver -\nage and very close to achieving the targets set by UNAIDS for 2020, there are still approximately 13.7% of people living with HIV in Spain who do not know they have the infection. \nConclusion: \nHIV remains a priority for European Public Health. \nHowever, we have effective tools such as universal pre -\nvention, screening and treatment to address the \ufb01ght \nagainst the HIV epidemic. It is therefore essential that these tools be implemented more widely and adapted to the time and characteristics of the epidemic. \nIS HIV ERADICATION POSSIBLE? FOR WHAT YEAR?\nVictoria Hernando\nIn 2014, the United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS \n(UNAIDS) set the 90-90-90 target for the year 2020, so that 90% of people living with HIV would know their diagno -\nsis, 90% of them would receive antiretroviral treatment and 90% of people on treatment would have a suppressed viral load, aiming for the end of the AIDS epidemic by 2030 [32]. These targets are monitored through the \u201ctreatment cascade\u201d or \u201ccontinuum of care\u201d that allows the HIV epidemic situation in a particular country or geographic area to be assessed. In Spain, in 2016, the percentages of each of these targets would be: 86.2%, 93.4% and 90.4%, so we would be very close to reaching the targets set by UNAIDS [32].\nVarious mathematical models have estimated that if the \n90-90-90 targets proposed by UNAIDS were achieved glob -\nally, increasing levels of diagnosis and antiretroviral treat -Past and future of HIV infection.

HOW IS IT \nDEFINED?\nJorge del Romero\nThe epidemiology of HIV in the world is highly variable in \neach geographic region. \nIn Europe, HIV prevalence is 0.4%, while in Africa it is \naround 4% (WHO, 2018) [44]. According to WHO, the follow-\ning are generally considered \u201cspeci\ufb01c populations\u201d for STIs/HIV:\n\u2022 Sex workers and their clients\u2022 Men who have sex with men (MSM)\u2022 Transgender people (TSX)\u2022 Prison inmates\u2022 Youths and adolescents\u2022 Drug users\nA study conducted at an STI clinic in Madrid in 2016 [45] \nconcluded that those most at risk of HIV infection were: MSM \nbetween 20 and 39 years old, with several previous negative serologies, a history of STIs and multiple sexual partners with whom they had sex without condoms, under the effect of rec-reational drugs (chemsex) [46].\nThe highest prevalences of HIV infection observed among the \n4,529 people seen for \ufb01rst consultations at the Sandoval Centre in 2018 were among transgender men and women in sex work (MSW, FSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) (Figure 1)\nConclusion:\nParticularly at risk of HIV infection are: sex workers \nand their clients, men who have sex with men, transgen-\nder people, prison inmates, young people and adolescents, and people who use drugs for sexual relations (chemsex). \nThe greatest risk is not knowing that you are \nHIV-positive or, if you do know, not being able to access antiretroviral treatment.given geographical area. The elimination of sexual transmis -\nsion of HIV, i.e. zero incidence, cannot be considered a realistic \ngoal, as the number of cases through this mode of transmis-sion remains very high. \nIn addition, we can highlight other key aspects of mon-\nitoring the HIV epidemic that help control infection and im -\nprove the situation of people living with HIV infection. These would be secondary prevention measures such as early diag -\nnosis and rapid access to antiretroviral treatment. Increase the frequency of HIV testing, especially for people at high risk of acquiring HIV infection, such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs [40]. In recent years, HIV testing sites have diversi\ufb01ed to include not only health care settings, but also community settings, and there is a need to promote rapid, safe and con\ufb01dential access, as there is still a high burden of discrimination and stigmatisation of people with HIV infection. According to Public Health England (PHE) of\ufb01cials, this has been one of the key points in the decline in the numbers of new HIV diagnoses in recent years in England [41,42].\nSimilarly, early initiation of antiretroviral therapy not only \nslows disease progression in the HIV-infected person, but also helps control the onset of other co-morbidities associated with both HIV infection and the longer life expectancy of HIV-in -\nfected people. It also interrupts transmission of the virus, as a person who achieves and maintains an undetectable viral load does not transmit HIV to sexual partners [43]. High adherence to prescribed antiretroviral treatment is vital to maintain the effectiveness of this preventive measure. \nConclusion:\nWe cannot currently consider the eradication of HIV \nas an achievable goal in the near future, but we can re -\nduce to zero the incidence of cases in certain modes of \ntransmission and improve control in others, such as sex -\nual transmission.

Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 136detection and management of important symptoms and con-\ncerns of PLHIV in routine clinical practice [51] . The dif\ufb01culty for the patient to de\ufb01ne what is wrong or what he/she feels (i.e. to identify it), the lack of knowledge or solutions to the problem and the de\ufb01cits in the relationship between the health professional and the patient, among other aspects, mean that no response is given to these health-related problems that can damage quality of life [53]. \nConclusion:\nThe life of an HIV-positive patient brings with it a \ndaily need to take responsibility and self-manage their \nhealth process, and this involves making physical, but al -\nso psychological and social adjustments that are closely related. Self-management tasks involve managing medi-cal issues, such as taking medication, managing adverse effects or symptoms; managing behaviours, such as life -\nstyle and habits; and coping with emotional issues asso -\nciated with HIV.\nWHAT ROLE SHOULD THE MEDIA PLAY?\nAlipio Guti\u00e9rrez\nThe \ufb01rst thing is to observe the maximum scienti\ufb01c rigor. \nIn the same way that medicine is moving towards precision, personalised medicine, we should seek precision journalism. With rigor, with data and scienti\ufb01c evidence. All the more so because now the media, like citizens, also communicate through social networks and there, scienti\ufb01c evidence does not gain value, it is not a plus in any way. Sometimes, on the con -\ntrary, the scienti\ufb01c truth about any health issue, and in this case, about HIV infection, has no relevance because anyone can assert their opinion on whatever they want and even if they do not have the truth, if they have a loyal following on social media, they can make that opinion prevail over the sci -\nenti\ufb01c reality of the moment. This is why I believe that it is necessary to effectively design speci\ufb01c pro\ufb01les for the media, scienti\ufb01c societies, patient associations and health administra -\ntions in order to know how to \u201ccompete\u201d in this new commu-nication scenario.\nSecondly, we must \ufb01ght the social stigma of those affect -\ned by HIV. For this, \u201cMASS MEDIA\u201d is the best and most effec -\ntive tool, together with the school. It has taken decades to put a face to this disease and it is still \u201chidden\u201d today. What is hid-den does not exist and also prevents normalisation. We must commit to the elimination of the social stigma against people affected by HIV that affects their lives.\nThirdly, the media should bring back the visibility that this \nepidemic had when it was deadly. At the time, it was frequent-ly featured in the media. Now that the disease \u201cdoes not kill\u201d, and has become chronic, it is no longer news. But this makes it all the more paradoxical. I believe that this is a commitment of ours that is highly topical because we are in the \u201ctime of chronicity\u201d and it is important that everything related to HIV, from research to the social normalisation of those affected, is WHAT IS LIFE LIKE FOR AN HIV-POSITIVE PATIENT \nIN PHYSICAL TERMS?\nMaria Jos\u00e9 Fuster\nOverall, it can be stated that the clinical situation of peo -\nple living with HIV (PLHIV) has evolved positively with the ex -\npansion of antiretroviral treatment and there is a continuing \ntrend towards improvement in key clinical immunological and virological parameters [47]. However, there are different pro -\n\ufb01les of PLHIV and different levels of complexity in their health care needs. The challenges faced by older PLHIV with co-mor -\nbidities are not the same as those faced by controlled and stable patients, those who are newly diagnosed, those with problematic substance use, or those who are socially excluded, to give an example of different pro\ufb01les. Therefore, the life of PLHIV in all its facets is not homogeneous but there is a lot of variability. \nRecent research by the Spanish Interdisciplinary AIDS So -\nciety (SEISIDA) measuring quality of life in a large sample of PLHIV in Spain (n=1,441) showed that the overall health per-ception and quality of life score was close to 70 on a scale of 100 (68.5 \u00b1 22.61). Health perception was lower in certain \nwell-established PLHIV pro\ufb01les, such as people over 50, wom -\nen, or those with a lower socio-educational level[48]. The over -\nall perception of health is in\ufb02uenced by many factors, one of them being the symptoms experienced on a daily basis. A study of a cohort of HIV-positive veterans in the United States showed that several of the symptoms they experienced pre -\ndicted decreased quality of life, survival, and increased hospi -\ntalisations [49]. The most prevalent symptoms found in other \ncountries with large cohorts of PLHIV are sleep problems, mus-cle pain, fatigue, sadness, anxiety, sexual problems, and ab -\ndominal pain/distension [50]. SEISIDA studies [51,52] show da -\nta in line with these \ufb01ndings, as the most prevalent symptoms in PLHIV in Spain are the same, and the most bothersome are sleep and sexual problems. The general health and symptoms experienced by PLHIV relate to many aspects of the process of living with HIV; the experiences, thoughts and emotions in -\nvolved. A qualitative study that SEISIDA and the Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) are conducting to improve the quality of life of PLHIV shows, among other \ufb01ndings, that sleep prob -\nlems and fatigue are related to social problems prevalent in HIV, such as economic deprivation and stigma. These symp -\ntoms are also associated with the emotional distress caused by the worries and fears that PLHIV have to cope with on a daily basis, such as uncertainty about the future or fear of rejection. These or other symptoms are also related to health habits or effects of medication. Symptoms are interconnected and often lead to a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d as they have different possible causes, the causes may determine various symptoms and depending on them, the intervention and self-management of the symp -\ntom will be different. So where should we start? It is essen -\ntial to detect these problems in order to be able to intervene and respond to them. Studies show a very high discrepancy between the symptoms reported by patients and what their doctors thought they were suffering from. The SEISIDA and IS-Global qualitative study explored the reasons for the lack of Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 13750 copies/ml close to delivery; there was not a single transmis -\nsion to the newborn (95% CI): 0.1%) [57].\nIn low-income countries, where breastfeeding is the main \nsource of nutrients, VT can also be drastically reduced to rates \nbelow 2% with early detection of infection in pregnancy and continuous ART during breastfeeding to be maintained for life (WHO option B+), which would prevent infection in new pregnancies. Although progress is quite remarkable, with the number of pregnant women treated with antiretrovirals hav -\ning doubled in the last decade to 92%, and the number of new infections in children having fallen by more than 70%, there were still 160,000 new infections in children by VT in 2018 [28].\nThe goal of VT elimination requires much more than the \navailability, ef\ufb01cacy and safety of antiretrovirals for universal lifelong treatment in women. A comprehensive approach is needed, including reducing new infections in women of child-bearing age and a sequence of maternal and newborn inter -\nventions, the removal of which at any point can lead to re -\nduced effectiveness in preventing VT. This chain of prevention includes adequate gestational control with suf\ufb01cient antenatal care, HIV testing and repeat testing during pregnancy and in low-income countries also during breastfeeding, ART as ear -\nly as possible for new diagnoses in pregnancy, post-exposure prophylaxis for newborns, and retention in the health system. It is precisely the most vulnerable populations that have the greatest dif\ufb01culty in complying with all the Available at:s in the epidemiological chain, and in whom prevention failures are most common. These higher-risk groups include migrant populations who are diagnosed or who present late during pregnancy or childbirth, drug users or the growing popula -\ntion of mothers who are themselves infected by VT, in whom adherence is a challenge and selection of resistant virus more prevalent. \nOn the other hand, although current ART is very effective \nand integrase inhibitors allow for a more rapid decline in viral load during pregnancy, they are not without toxicity. Current WHO guidelines recommend dolutegravir-based regimens, which may be associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects in sub-Saharan populations. Although the bene\ufb01ts \nfar outweigh the potential adverse effects, comprehensive epidemiological surveillance of all antiretrovirals is required to establish safety in the newborn and thus de\ufb01ne the most appropriate treatment regimen in each risk situation. \nEven with today\u2019s great advances, there are still high-risk \ncases of vertical transmission where, although it is too late to take preventive measures during pregnancy, it is still possible to intervene at birth and in the newborn with immediate com -\nbined prophylaxis. Even when there has been intrauterine in -\nfection detected by diagnosis in the \ufb01rst 48h, immediate ART to the newborn could allow us to prevent the spread of the vi -\nrus, reduce the viral reservoir as much as possible, and perhaps a potential eradication.\nConclusion:\nElimination of vertical transmission of HIV in low-in -\ncome countries is feasible. To achieve this, prevention of once again re\ufb02ected in the different media as a re\ufb02ection of \nwhat is happening in society.\nFinally, I am going to say something which, being a jour -\nnalist myself, may come as a shock: we have to stop being ob -\njective about health issues in general. We must be belligerent with scienti\ufb01c evidence, with scienti\ufb01c rigor and eliminate this perverse practice of journalism that, in my opinion, is not sustainable in terms of health. Some media treat health issues like any other issue, wielding an objectivity based on EQUIDIS -\nTANCE, offering the same time, the same space in a newspa-per, TV or radio programme to those who hold one opinion and those who oppose it. This is NOT VALID in health. It is as if, by virtue of this objectivity/equidistance, we were to propose, for example, offering the same time and space in the media to those who defend the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and those who violate them. \nWith health issues, and HIV being a clear example, we \nhave to be belligerent and always take the side of scienti\ufb01c evidence.\nConclusion: \nIn its relation to HIV disease, the media must remain \ntopical, adhere to scienti\ufb01c objectivity, help to overcome \nthe social stigma of those affected and contribute to the physical and psychological well-being of those affected.\nHAVE WE ENDED VERTICAL TRANSMISSION?\nJose Tom\u00e1s Ramos\nVertical transmission (VT) is the predominant mode of \nHIV-1 transmission in children and is the route of infection for the vast majority of new infections worldwide. In natural his -\ntory, VT ranges from 15-25% in the absence of breastfeeding, rising to 40% in populations where breastfeeding is necessary, such as in low-income countries where the vast majority of infections occur globally [54]. Since the 1994 ACTG 076 trial, in which zidovudine was administered in pregnancy, delivery and to the neonate, documenting 67% ef\ufb01cacy of antiretrovi -\nral therapy (ART) in preventing VT, there have been enormous advances in the prevention of VT [16]. Viral load in pregnancy is the most important independent factor associated with VT. In developed countries, the use of combination ART and effec-tive virological suppression to undetectable levels in pregnan -\ncy, maintained during delivery, leads to transmission rates of less than 1% [55]. Prospective follow-up of pregnant women with HIV and their children has been carried out since 2000 in 9 public hospitals in the Community of Madrid, with data from 1,475 mother-child pairs up to December 2018. Overall VT was 1.2% (95% CI: 0.7-1.8%), currently less than 0.5%. Moreover, in the few VT cases that have occurred, there were missed op -\nportunities to avoid it [56]. When effective ART is initiated be -\nfore conception and undetectable viral load is maintained until delivery, vertical transmission may be eliminated, as demon -\nstrated by a study in France in which of 2,651 mothers who initiated ART before conception and remained with viral load < Past and future of HIV infection.

HIV-infected children who are now young adults received cART after the \ufb01rst few years of life and thus neurocognitive impairment has been observed, but with good performance in daily life. Some neuroimaging studies have shown alterations in patients with good neurological function [61].\nCardiovascular comorbidity studied in a study of 150 \nperinatally transmitted HIV-positive 15-year-old adoles -\ncents found an increase in carotid intima media compared to matched healthy controls, an indirect marker of cardiovascular risk [62].\nBone comorbidity studied in a series of 98 adolescents \naged 16 years showed 15% with decreased bone mineral den-sity (BMD), although when adjusted for height, the percentage dropped to 4%. The prevalence of BMD decline correlated with CD4 nadir and CD4/CD8 ratio [63].\nHCV co-infection, present in 12% of patients, has been \ntreated with direct-acting drugs, with a cure rate of close to 100%, although 30% of patients have liver involvement (F3 and F4 \ufb01brosis) [64].\nIn terms of sexual and reproductive health, women in the \ntransition cohort have had a signi\ufb01cant number of pregnan -\ncies, more than 60. In a study of 28 pregnant women, nine of them (32%) were at high risk of perinatal transmission because of a detectable viral load close to delivery. In this series, there was no transmission of HIV infection in the second generation thanks to the implementation of retention in care strategies and optimisation of ART [65]. \nFinally, a poorer quality of life as measured by validated \nSF12 questionnaires is observed compared to non-HIV young people. Thus in 39 young HIV+ verticals (mean age: 23.36 years, SD = 3.83) and 39 HIV- (mean age: 22.97 years, SD = 3.80), HIV+ patients were found to have lower scores on the physical health subscale than non-HIV (P = 0.001) and the general Spanish youth population (P = 0.006). HIV+ patients had lower scores on the mental health subscale (MCS) than the general Spanish youth population (P<0.001). Quality of life was better in HIV+ patients undergoing studies and worse for cocaine and cannabis use (P = 0.002) [66].\nConclusion:\nChildren born with HIV who are now adolescents \nand young adults are mostly in a controlled HIV status \nand need to be kept engaged with the health system and cART.

CART is preventing perinatal transmission while controlling viral replication in infected children.\nIn Spain, since 2008 there has been a follow-up cohort of \nHIV-positive children and adolescents from the AIDS Research Network (CoRISpe), which includes patients treated in Paediat -\nric Units (PU) since 1995. CoRISpe is in turn linked to the HIV Biobank of the AIDS Research Network, and is allowing us to learn about the evolution of paediatric infection in our coun -\ntry.\nIn CoRISpe, 1,344 patients are registered. Most of them \nwere born before universal HIV screening in pregnant women, with 10% of patients in the cohort dying, mostly prior to cART. \nCoRISpe is a cohort of mainly adolescent and young adult \npatients who survived the early years of the epidemic before cART became available, with 51% having transferred to Adult Units (AU). New CoRISpe patients are mainly immigrant chil -\ndren born in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South Amer -\nica, with new HIV infections in children born in Spain being anecdotal.\nAt the end of 2017, 403 young adults with vertical trans -\nmission are being treated in the AUs. These patients have a median age of 25 (ICER 23.6-25.8) and have been followed up in UA after transition for 7.5 years (ICER 5.1-10.5). Of them, 95% were born in Spain and 56.7% are women. Clinical stage is 29.6% A, 40.4% B, 30% C. Some 95% are receiving cART, with 76% receiving once-daily (OD) regimens and 81% with HIV viral load <50 copies/ml [58]. Immune status is good, with CD4 of 723/mm3 (RIC 500-965) although 33% have a CD4/CD8 ratio below 1 [59].\nAnalysing the accumulated resistance mutations in a \ngroup of 133 patients transferred and compared to patients still in PU, a higher percentage of acquired resistance mu -\ntations was observed (75% vs 28% p=0.006), mainly to nu-cleoside analogues (67% vs 28% p<0.0001), and to protease inhibitors (32% vs 16% p=0.0384). In this substudy, despite having good immune status, 74% have >500 TCD4 cells/mm\n3. \nOnly 65% are found with suppressed viral load, re\ufb02ecting the dif\ufb01culties in treating these patients with extensive experience with families of drugs, at complex ages (late adolescents) and tired of taking ART [60].\nIt should also be noted that after transition, some patients \nhave poor adherence to the health care system with failure to take ART, which in some circumstances leads to disease pro -\ngression and in some cases (2% of the transition cohort) death [58].Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 139mortality where they have been used [81]. In recent years, \nsome generic antiretroviral (ARV) drugs have begun to be mar -\nketed in Spain, with nevirapine, efavirenz (EFV), lamivudine (3TC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), darunavir, ritonavir, and the combinations abacavir/3TC, emtricitabine (FTC)/TDF, and FTC/TDF/EFV currently available. In a context of limited resources for health care, the use of generics would enable a reduction in the cost of ART.\nIn the European Union, it is acceptable for a drug to be \nreplaced by its generic equivalent if the generic equivalent has the same composition and pharmaceutical form as the original drug and has demonstrated bioequivalence with the original drug through bioavailability studies [80]. However, it is con -\ntroversial to substitute a \ufb01xed-dose co-formulation (FDC) or a complete single-tablet regimen (STR) for its separate com -\nponents (de-simpli\ufb01cation or breaking of combos). The break-down of complete single-tablet regimens is the main argument against the use of generic ARVs in clinical practice. Currently, the only full \ufb01xed-dose combination regimen of generic drugs available in our country is TDF/FTC/EFV; the other STRs used in ART are not currently available in generic formulation unless their components are administered separately [21,82-84].\nDe-simpli\ufb01cation of STRs could lead to considerable \ufb01 -\nnancial savings, making it possible to allocate these resources to other health problems. A cost-bene\ufb01t study using mathe-matical simulation estimated savings of $42,500 per patient and total savings of $920,000,000 for the US healthcare sys-tem if treatment with Atripla\u00ae (STRs including efavirenz, teno-fovir and emtricitabine) were replaced by treatment with three separate daily tablets of generic efavirenz, generic lamivudine and tenofovir [85]. In France, another recent study has also shown that replacing ART regimens with generic drugs leads to considerable savings in health expenditure [86].\nOn the other hand, criticisms of these changes are based \non the fact that switching to a higher number of tablets could decrease adherence and therefore the effectiveness of ART, and could favour the emergence of resistance [80]. Arguments in favour of using STRs include the simpli\ufb01cation of treatment that would lead to a better quality of life for patients, and the reduced potential for resistance development by reducing the risk of confounding and the non-adherence to single drugs (selective non-adherence) [87]. The use of STRs has been as-sociated with increased adherence[88-90] and a lower risk of hospitalisation [88, 89]. In this regard, a recent meta-analysis concluded that STRs were associated with better adherence, better virological response and lower cost than multi-drug therapy, but there was no difference in terms of immune re -\nsponse, mortality, adverse events or tolerability [90, 91].\nHowever, most of the studies cited to support the greater \neffectiveness of STRs versus multiple daily tablets have been conducted in the context of simpli\ufb01cation strategies, com -\nparing STRs with other antiretroviral treatments that do not have the same composition or are even from different families (e.g. comparing an integrase inhibitor-based STR with a pro-tease inhibitor-based or non-nucleoside-based pre-treatment). infection and the impact on improving patients\u2019 quality of life \nis undoubted. However, its high cost in a resource-constrained environment makes it necessary to manage expenditure well.\nA low CD4 cell count at diagnosis is associated with in -\ncreased morbidity and mortality and higher costs. Patients with CD4 cell counts below 50 cells/microlitre generate a high -\ner non-CART cost, which decreases substantially when CD4s increase above 100 cells/microlitre[31,48,51,66-72]. \nThere are 146,000 people living with HIV in our country \n[21,72,73] who will require lifelong treatment. The total cost of ART has risen steadily since the inception of highly active ART, with the annual cost of ART being[30] 734,367,344 euros, and it has been estimated that ART accounts for 73% of the total lifetime health care costs of HIV patients in the US[74] and 87% in the \ufb01rst year in Spain [75].\nThe cost classi\ufb01cation orders costs according to which \nagent bears them. Thus, costs would be grouped into costs for the health sector (basically those previously identi\ufb01ed as health costs), costs for the patient and his/her family (most of the non-health costs: transport, time, etc.), and costs for other sectors (non-health costs borne by other public entities or by society as a whole, such as productivity costs), indirect costs [76].\nConclusion: \nThe cost of ART per patient per year varies signi\ufb01 -\ncantly depending on the drugs chosen in the treatment \nregimen. The average annual cost per HIV patient has \nfallen considerably in recent years as a result of drug patent expiry and ART optimisation.\nECONOMIC BARRIERS TO HIV MANAGEMENT. \nGENERIC PHARMACEUTICALS\nIn\u00e9s Suarez Garc\u00eda\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) has substantially increased \nthe life expectancy of patients living with HIV [77,78] , moving \nto considering HIV infection as a chronic disease in patients \nreceiving ART with virological suppression. Adherence to ART is one of the key determinants of its effectiveness [79] and is of crucial importance given that treatment must be maintained throughout the patient\u2019s life. \nIn the wake of the last economic crisis, several regional \nhealth administrations and hospitals have imposed measures to reduce the cost of ART, such as setting an annual cost limit per patient or restricting access to some antiretrovirals. These measures have been applied differently in different autono-mous communities in Spain and in some hospitals, producing inequities in access to different ART and being signi\ufb01cantly as -\nsociated with the use of ART regimens not recommended in clinical practice guidelines [69].\nGeneric drugs are drugs that have demonstrated bioe -\nquivalence to branded drugs, but cost less because the pat -\nent on the original branded drugs has expired[80]. These drugs have proven to be effective and have reduced morbidity and Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 14010 years in the absence of cART and usually with VL<5000 \nHIV-1 RNA copies/mL (~5%). B) from a virological point of view: subjects with low VL (<2000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, so-called viraemic controllers (VC)) or undetectable levels (<40 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL), elite controllers (EC) (<1%), for at least one year in the absence of cART.\nCurrent cART aims for undetectability of VC, so in most \ncases VCs and LTNPs with detectable VC have ended up on cART. In relation to ECs, it was observed that it is a heteroge-neous phenotype, with approximately 25% losing VC control and 40% having decreased CD4+ levels [101]. These \ufb01ndings, together with others in which ECs have been found to have a higher rate of hospitalisation, preferably for cardiovascular disease, than other non-controller subjects [102], have led to reconsideration of controllers as a model of persistent viro -\nlogical remission in the absence of cART or \u201cfunctional cure\u201d. However, these \ufb01ndings are controversial, as in another cohort, the same authors did not observe such differences [103]. Nor have other large cohorts of controllers found a higher prev-alence of cardiovascular disease and other non-AIDS events compared to non-controllers [104].\nThe key to this controversy is the heterogeneity of the \ncontrolling phenotype. ECs can be classi\ufb01ed into transient controllers (TC), which are those that eventually lose control of the VC, and persistent controllers (PC), which are those that maintain control of the VC inde\ufb01nitely [105,106]. Finding bi -\nomarkers that facilitate the discrimination of these two phe -\nnotypes is important for two reasons: 1) it allows us to design treatment strategies for TCs as they eventually progress, 2) it allows us to recognise PC as the true model of functional cure. In fact, different studies have shown that PCs have higher lev -\nels of HIV-speci\ufb01c T-response [105], associated with lower viral \nvariability and diversity, along with lower levels of viral reser-voir [105,107], and in turn, have lower levels of in\ufb02ammation \n[105]. Additionally, it has been shown that these two pheno -\ntypes also differ in a peculiar proteomic pro\ufb01le associated with less in\ufb02ammation in PCs compared to TCs, as well as a differ-ent metabolomic and lipidomic pro\ufb01le [71]. These results seg -\nregate PCs as the true model of persistent virological remission and, on the other hand, differentiate them from subjects who will lose spontaneous control and should therefore be identi -\n\ufb01ed as patients who should be offered treatment. \nThese \ufb01ndings shed light on the current controversy over \nwhether HIV controllers should be treated with cART. Recent studies have shown that cART in controllers has been associ -\nated with a decrease in in\ufb02ammation and immune activation in these subjects [108]. However, most of the subjects included in these studies were VC with detectable viral load. According to the results discussed above, in the case of a subject who has been infected for more than 30 years, with persistently un-detectable CV and CD4+ cell counts above 500 cells/mm\n3, the \nbene\ufb01t of cART in this scenario would be more than doubtful, contrary to what would occur in the TC subject, where cART and/or complementary immunotherapeutic strategies would allow lowering the levels of in\ufb02ammation. There are very few studies that have compared the ef\ufb01cacy \nof STR treatment with the administration of its components (including generic equivalents) separately. Only 7 observation -\nal studies on STR de-simpli\ufb01cation breakage strategies have been published. Six of them compared the administration of the brand-name drugs Atripla \u00ae [92-94], Atripla \u00ae and other \n\ufb01xed-dose combinations [95,96] and Triumeq \u00ae [97] with their \nseparate components, and all found similar effectiveness. In addition, another study evaluated Triumeq\u00ae de-simpli\ufb01cation in a single cohort of patients and found no virological failures at 48 weeks [98]. \nAlthough there is no conclusive evidence to show that \nde-simpli\ufb01cation of STRs is associated with reduced treatment effectiveness, Spanish ART guidelines recommend the use of STRs [83, 99], and most physicians are not in favour of switch-ing from STRs to their generic components separately: in a study in Spain, only 4.1% of physicians said they would never prescribe generic ARVs, but 53.3% would not do so if it meant increasing the number of daily pills. As for STR de-simpli\ufb01ca -\ntion, 63.9% of doctors think it would be associated with worse adherence and 42% with lower effectiveness [70]. However, in their latest update, European guidelines recommend the use of generic ARVs even if this means not using STRs [100].\nConclusion:\nGeneric ARVs have proven to be effective in the \ntreatment of HIV infection and their use could lead to \nsigni\ufb01cant cost savings for the National Health System. Their use would imply switching from STRs to the ad -\nministration of their components separately (de-simpli-\ufb01cation or breaking of combos), a strategy that is still controversial, which has led to a lack of widespread use of generic ARVs in our country. However, a small number of observational studies have shown similar effectiveness of the use of STRs with respect to their separate compo -\nnents. It would be desirable to create consensus criteria for the use of generic ARVs that include physicians, pa -\ntients, and health administration.\nWHAT IS THE REALITY OF \u201cSLOW PROGRESSOR\u201d \nPATIENTS?\nEzequiel Ruiz-Mateos\nLong-term non-progressors are patients who are at one \nend of the spectrum of HIV infection progression. When we \ntalk about progression, we mean no clinical progression and no immunovirological progression. Thus, they have high CD4+ lymphocyte counts comparable to the non-HIV-infected pop -\nulation and low or undetectable viral loads (VL) in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (cART). This has led to these subjects being considered as a model for the development of immuno-therapeutic and vaccine strategies.\nTraditionally, these individuals have been classi\ufb01ed: A) \nfrom an immunological point of view: Long-term non-pro -\ngressors (LTNP) with CD4+ cells >500 cells/mm\n3 for more than Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 141providing antiretroviral treatment to all people living with HIV \nmay be unsustainable in the long term. As the mortality rate among people living with HIV, due to the widespread use of treatment, declines faster than the number of new HIV in -\nfections, the prevalence of people living with HIV has grown signi\ufb01cantly worldwide. In addition, the increasing number of people suffering at an older age (>60 years) is associated with a number of new challenges, both clinical and immunological. In the absence of an effective prophylactic HIV vaccine, as well as the challenge of treating more than 38 million people with sustained antiretroviral therapy, it is clear that new therapeu -\ntic strategies will be required for effective viral control, pre -\nvention or a potential cure. Therefore, there remains a critical medical need for research into new strategies to combat HIV, including the urgency of identifying an effective therapeutic intervention to control the virus in the absence of antiretrovi -\nral treatment and ultimately cure HIV [110].\nIn this context, multiple medical strategies are being ex -\nplored to eradicate the replication-competent HIV reservoir (\u201ccure\u201d) or to control viral rebound in the absence of antiretro-viral treatment without HIV eradication (\u201csustained virological remission\u201d). \nIn recent years, we have learned that the viral reservoir \nis established soon after viral infection. However, early ART limits the size of viral reservoirs, reduces in\ufb02ammation and immune activation, and reduces viral diversity in both adults and children, without necessarily delaying viral rebound if ART is stopped. Several compounds, called latency reversal agents, are being tested to assess their ability to reactivate latent viruses that comprise the main viral reservoir in sub -\njects on antiretroviral treatment (\u201cShock & Kill\u201d strategy). However, it is still dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd a balance between their speci\ufb01c ef\ufb01cacy in viral reactivation and their systemic tox -\nicity. Immune therapies capable of facilitating cytotoxic T cell-mediated killing of infected cells, or antibody-mediated antiviral effect, sometimes in combination with latency re -\nactivation agents, are also being explored. And \ufb01nally, cell and gene therapies are also being investigated [111]. In this context, allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for haematological malignancies contributed in 2007 to the \ufb01rst, and until recently only, case of complete eradication of HIV-1, the \u201cBerlin patient\u201d, whose donor had a homozygous mutation in the CCR5 co-receptor for HIV that prevents HIV infection of the grafted cells[23]. In early 2019, a second case of HIV remission was announced in a person who has been off antiviral treatment since September 2017, as part of the IciStem project [112] (www.icistem.org), a multi-centre study to guide and investigate the potential for HIV cure in infect -\ned people requiring allogeneic stem cell transplantation due to severe haematological pathologies. However, due to its inherent risk, this strategy is neither scalable nor applicable outside the context of severe haematological malignancies and is therefore limited to a small group of HIV-infected individuals. The challenge is to adapt or \ufb01nd viral remission strategies in the absence of antiretroviral treatment that can reach as many people with HIV infection as possible.Therefore, these data support PC as the correct model of \nfunctional cure to look to when trying to develop immuno -\ntherapeutic strategies. It is worth noting that in recent studies, \n50% of the PCs failed to amplify the virus, and in those that did, the variability and diversity of the virus was very low [105]. Dating studies suggest that the evolution of the virus was stalled at a point very close to infection [105]. These \ufb01ndings suggest that perhaps some individuals managed to control the virus from the beginning and to some extent persistently stopped its replication, so that these subjects could be con-sidered \u201cfunctionally cured\u201d or even some of them may have achieved a \u201csterilising cure\u201d, i.e. they managed to eradicate the virus. Regardless of whether this is the case, this small group of subjects with a persistent LTNP-EC pro\ufb01le constitute a true model of functional cure. Comprehensive analysis of virolog -\nical, genetic and immunological factors in these subjects will provide important clues on how to achieve viral reservoir re-duction and/or elimination and persistent virological remission in the absence of antiretroviral therapy in the general HIV-in -\nfected patient population. \nConclusion\nSlow progressors or non-progressors are a peculiar \ngroup among HIV-infected people. Subjects with tran -\nsient immunovirological control would be candidates \nfor antiretroviral therapy and other complementary im -\nmunotherapeutic strategies, whilst those with persistent immunovirological control can be considered a model of functional cure or sustained virological remission.\nWHAT IS AN HIV CURE AND HOW IS IT \nDOCUMENTED?\nJavier Mart\u00ednez Picado\nCombination antiretroviral therapy is the current stand -\nard of care for HIV infection. When used daily, antiretroviral \ntherapy effectively controls HIV replication, prevents the de -\nvelopment of AIDS, increases life expectancy and reduces the risk of transmission. In 2019, approximately 26 million people had access to antiretroviral therapy, representing 68% of all infected people (UNAIDS 2020 report) [109].\nHowever, current antiretroviral treatment is not curative, \ndue to viral persistence in cellular and anatomical reservoirs that escape antiviral drugs or the immune system. Conse -\nquently, interruption of therapy results in rapid viral rebound in most infected people, necessitating lifelong treatment. De -\nspite the undoubted bene\ufb01ts of antiretroviral treatment, it al -\nso has important limitations: (a) Drug toxicities, complex drug interactions (polypharmacy) and persistent immune dysfunc -\ntion have signi\ufb01cant health consequences; (b) Lifelong adher-ence to treatment is a challenge for many; (c) Resistance to antiretroviral drugs remains a problem, particularly for those who are not fully adherent to treatment; (d) Stigma is still as -\nsociated with taking antiviral drugs; (e) Operational and logis -\ntical challenges related to involved drug distribution in many parts of the world are formidable, and the economic cost of Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 142ventive vaccine candidate that builds on the results of the Thai \nRV144 trial [117], which demonstrated modest (30%) - and short-lived - ef\ufb01cacy of protection in a Thai population at low risk of HIV acquisition. The new vaccines are based on the in -\nclusion of mosaic immunogens, which, through bioinformatics optimisation, design HIV proteins with a number of sequence variants with the idea of inducing an immune response to a larger number of circulating viral variants. Studies in the NHP model have shown a vaccine ef\ufb01cacy of 60% associated with induction of large cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated responses \nand high levels of monoclonal antibodies [118]. The results of \nthe Phase 2b/3 studies are also being developed through the HVTN and results are expected over the next 3 years. \nFinally, the complexity of designing new clinical trials of \npreventive vaccines following the progressive implementation of PrEP as a prevention measure in populations at high risk of acquiring HIV, both in terms of sample size, implementation and ethical issues, should be emphasised. \nThe development of a therapeutic vaccine aims to achieve \ncontrol or complete eradication of HIV from the body without the need for ART. This objective must be achieved through a strategy that is equal to (or better than) the ART, both in terms of cost and accessibility, but above all in terms of security, which sets the bar for non-inferiority very high. \nOne of the main obstacles to the development of a thera-\npeutic vaccine is also the viral diversity, in addition to the viral subtypes, some of the variability is due to immunological ad -\naptation. HIV mutates and escapes relatively easily from the pressure exerted by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) mediated by individual HLA molecules. Therapeutic vaccines must there -\nfore be effective in different locations with different circulat -\ning viruses and in populations with widely differing genetic backgrounds [119]. To combat such immense diversity, new immunogen designs are based on attempting to re-educate the HIV-speci\ufb01c immune response against those regions of HIV that are highly conserved among the different viral subtypes responsible for generating highly functional HLA-independ -\nent cytotoxic responses [120,121] and are currently in clinical phases of development.\nAnother major obstacle in the \ufb01eld of HIV cure lies in the \nrelative degree of immunode\ufb01ciency of people with HIV in -\nfection. High levels of chronic in\ufb02ammation lead to persistent immune depletion that signi\ufb01cantly limits the functionality of CTLs and the longevity of vaccine-induced responses. This is why we often see early clinical trials of new vaccine candidates \nin groups of patients treated in the earliest stages of HIV in -\nfection, whose levels of viral escape and immune depletion are \nlower than after years of chronic infection. With new devel-opments in the \ufb01eld of immunotherapies in oncology and au -\ntoimmune diseases, the combination of therapeutic vaccines with immunomodulatory agents of the immune response is expected to be explored.\nFinally, the viral reservoir - made up of latently HIV-in -\nfected cells that are relatively invisible to the immune sys-tem - is a major source of viral rebound once ART is stopped. Conclusion: \nThere is an urgent need to design and implement in -\nnovative strategies based on new molecular mechanisms \nto cure HIV infection by ending viral persistence. The aim is to improve the quality of life of HIV-infected people by reducing dependence on antiviral drugs, treatment bur -\nden and stigma.\nWHY AREN\u2019T VACCINES ARRIVING?\nBeatriz Mothe\nDespite multiple HIV prevention methods, including the \nuse of antiretrovirals as PrEP, and the ef\ufb01cacy of current ART and its excellent tolerability pro\ufb01le, an estimated 1.7 million people acquired HIV in 2018 and still one third of the 38 mil -\nlion people living with HIV had not accessed ART according to UNAIDS. This is why the development of preventive and thera -\npeutic vaccines for HIV remains one of the most urgent scien -\nti\ufb01c challenges of our time [113].\nOne of the main dif\ufb01culties for vaccine development lies \nin the great diversity of HIV globally. Subtype C infections ac -\ncounted for 50% of infections in 2004. Subtypes A, B, D and G accounted for 12%, 10%, 3% and 6%, respectively; and re -\ncombinant subtypes 18%. The fact that different HIV subtypes can differ from each other by more than 30% in their viral genome makes the development of a universal vaccine very complex [114].\nStill, in recent years, major advances have been made in \nthe isolation and characterisation of monoclonal antibod -\nies derived from B cells of people with chronic HIV infection against relatively conserved regions of the broadly neutral -\nising HIV envelope glycoprotein antibodies (bNAbs). Some of these bNAbs target CD4 binding site epitopes, the V3 glycan, the V1V2 apex, the interface region of gp120 or the membrane proximal region of gp41, among others. The use of new sin -\ngle B cell culture methods, high-throughput neutralisation screenings and B cell sorting by \ufb02ow cytometry with envelope antigens have been key to the isolation and generation of new bNAbs [115].\nWhile progress is being made in understanding how \nbNAbs can be safely induced by a vaccine, several studies of passive infusion of bNAbs alone or in combination in the non-human primate model of infection using chimeric SIVs (SHIV) suggest promising results in terms of safety and protec -\ntion, which is associated with the levels of neutralisation of the different antibodies [116]. Several Phase 2b clinical trials are already underway led from the HVTN/HPTN vaccine and pre -\nvention trials network (Antibody Mediated Protection (AMP) trials HVTN 704/HPTN 085 NCT02716675 and HVTN 703/HPTN 081 NCT02568215) and their results have just been published in 2021, demonstrating that passive infusion of antibodies can prevent the acquisition of infection of those strains sensitive to CRV01. \nOf note is the \ufb01rst Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of a new pre-Past and future of HIV infection.

Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 143because they want to protect themselves, and that in general \nthey want a healthier sex life, without the ongoing threat of HIV. Recall that, according to the World Health Organisation, sexual health is not only the absence of disease but also a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality. And PrEP shows that users can have a more pleas -\nurable sex life. \nBut there are still voices arguing that PrEP should be used \nwith caution because it will \u201copen the door to promiscuity\u201d and condom use will be abandoned, with all its consequences. It is true that there is concern about a possible increase in the in -\ncidence of other STIs due to so-called \u201crisk compensation\u201d, i.e. the adoption of higher risk behaviours (non-use of condoms, increased number of sexual partners, etc.). In this regard, it should be noted that while most clinical trials of PrEP have not observed such \u201crisk compensation\u201d, there are implementation studies in which an increase in STIs is observed. In any case, we must bear in mind that this increase has been registered in Spain and other countries for years before the implementation of PrEP, so this increase in STIs cannot be attributed to PrEP, or at least not in its entirety. There are other factors that may in\ufb02uence this increase.\nWhat needs to be done is to implement strategies to \ncounteract this potential increase. One such strategy is regu -\nlar screening for STIs, which allows early detection and treat -\nment of STIs, many of which are asymptomatic, thus helping to break the chain of transmission. In this regard, some studies show through modelling that regular screening can reduce the incidence of STIs. We also know that the presence of STIs in -\ncreases the risk of HIV infection, which further supports the recommendation for such screening.\nIt should be emphasised that PrEP is not only about ad -\nministering the drug, but also includes follow-up of users, which is an excellent opportunity to maintain contact with health services, allowing for STI screening, counselling and sexual health education, detection of other health problems, e.g. drug use.\nPrEP is therefore not synonymous with abandoning con -\ndom use, which must continue to play an important role, but is a powerful preventive tool as part of a broader, holistic pre -\nvention strategy. At this early stage of the implementation of PrEP in our National Health System, it is essential to promote and facilitate access to PrEP for all those at risk of HIV infec -\ntion. This requires providing adequate information to the pop -\nulation, especially potential bene\ufb01ciaries, but also awareness raising and training of health professionals on PrEP.\nThe challenge is to implement and reinforce all proven \neffective preventive strategies. If we can, we can dramatical -\nly reduce HIV infections, as is already being seen where such strategies are being implemented.\nConclusion:\nPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretroviral \ndrugs is proving highly effective in HIV prevention. Possi -\nble \u201cside effects\u201d, such as an increase in Sexually Trans -Most likely, neither eradication nor a functional cure of HIV \ncan be achieved without eliminating or achieving very low levels of viral reservoir while inducing a highly functional and long-lasting immune response [122]. \nConclusion:\nThe enormous viral diversity and the somatic hy -\npermutation required to induce antibodies with broad \nneutralising capacity make the development of effective preventive vaccines against the different HIV viral strains extremely dif\ufb01cult. Alternatively, promising results in primate models suggest that passive administration of monoclonal antibodies may have high protective ef\ufb01cacy.\nHOW FAR SHOULD WE GO WITH RISK BEHAVIOUR \nPROPHYLAXIS?\nPep Coll\nWe now have proven prevention tools that we must use if \nwe are serious about ending the HIV epidemic. A very impor -\ntant and relatively new tool that is changing the prevention \nparadigm is PrEP.\nUntil just over 7 years ago, the main preventive tool avail -\nable was the condom, which has prevented countless HIV in-fections, but has not stopped the \ufb02ow of new infections. \nWe now know that the combination of two antiretrovirals \n(tenofovir, disoproxil, fumarate and emtricitabine) can prevent infection in people exposed to HIV, with close to 100% effec -\ntiveness, provided there is correct adherence to the medica -\ntion. This is the so-called oral PrEP, which has been approved in the National Health System and which was the great unre -\nsolved issue in our system. Such is the evidence available on the ef\ufb01cacy of PrEP that its recommendation [123] is included in most clinical guidelines: the \ufb01rst was published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2014. In 2015, the World Health Organisation stated that PrEP should be of -\nfered to all populations at higher risk of HIV infection. It points out that PrEP should be a prevention option in addition to condom use, promotion of HIV testing and counselling, treat -\nment as prevention, male circumcision and harm reduction strategies for people who inject drugs.\nOther guidelines, such as those of the European AIDS Clin -\nical Society\u2019 and GeSIDA [124], also recommend PrEP for those who may be at higher risk of infection [125].\nThe Spanish Bioethics Committee has come out in favour \nof the introduction of PrEP[126] , stating that it is ethical to \nfund it. The Committee sees this as a case similar to others, such as tobacco, noting that \u201cat no point in the tobacco con -\ntrol debate was there the option of limiting or excluding ac -\ncess to health care for those who had irresponsibly put their health at risk by smoking\u201d. This means that we cannot deny a person access to a powerful preventive tool because he or she engages in risky behaviours, or rather what we label as such, with all the stigmatising burden that this can entail. \nIt is important to note that people who seek PrEP do so Past and future of HIV infection.

COULD IT BE ANNUAL?\nMiguel G\u00f3rgolas\nParenteral antiretroviral therapy is now, fortunately, a re -\nality. Long-acting parenteral treatment is available with great \nsuccess for some chronic diseases, such as schizophrenia, or as a method of contraception. There are many reasons that support its suitability for the treatment of chronic infection in people living with HIV. On the basis that the patient should not be injection-phobic, parenteral treatment has, \u201ca priori\u201d, a large number of advantages over oral treatment. Firstly, it can be expected to facilitate good adherence or compliance, as it is, in a way, a form of directly observed treatment adminis -\ntered by health personnel. Secondly, the fact of not having to take daily medication allows the patient to \u201cforget\u201d about the infection and live a completely normal life. Thirdly, it is more than likely to lead to a reduction of the stigma that, unfor -\ntunately, still exists for many patients who can sometimes be challenged by the simple fact of having to take daily medica -\ntion. \nCurrently, the most advanced development consists of \na parenteral treatment based on the administration of two drugs, cabotegravir and rilpivirine, which share the appropri -\nate pharmacokinetic characteristics to be co-administered to achieve high antiviral potency, slow release and low metabol -\nic clearance, allowing for administration every 2 months. This type of treatment is called CARLA, an acronym for Cabotegra-vir + Rilpivirine + Long + Acting. \nThe \ufb01rst study of this combination, the LATTE-2 trial ex -\nplored the safety and ef\ufb01cacy of the combination as a main -\ntenance treatment, as well as \ufb01nding the optimal dosage for subsequent phase III trials. Patients without prior antiretroviral treatment received a 20-week induction treatment with oral CAB+ABC/3T. Those who achieved an HIV-1 viral load <50 cop/mL were randomised to one arm of parenteral treatment every 4 weeks, another arm every 8 weeks and another arm continued with oral treatment. The conclusion was that CAR-LA demonstrated its ability to maintain undetectable viral load when administered every 4 or 8 weeks [22]. Subsequently, a phase III trial (Flair trial) was conducted in ART-na\u00efve patients who received an effective induction course of DTG/ABA/3TC for 20 weeks followed by cabotegravir and oral rilpivirine for 4 weeks, before switching to parenteral treatment. Those pa -\ntients who agreed to participate in the study were randomised to receive either CARLA every 4 weeks or continue with oral DTG/ABA/3TC. The ef\ufb01cacy of CARLA was similar to conven -\ntional oral treatment and local tolerance of the injections was good, being better tolerated in successive administra -\ntions throughout the study [127]. Notably, 97% of patients mitted Infections, are not a reason not to recommend it, \nbut to look for strategies to counteract this potential ef -\nfect.\nCOULD YOU SUMMARIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF \nTHE MAJOR GROUPS OF ANTIVIRAL AGENTS?\nEsteban Mart\u00ednez\nThere are four major groups of antiviral agents that have \nbeen used in the treatment of HIV infection: nucleoside an -\nalogues (NAs), protease inhibitors (PIs), non-nucleoside ana -\nlogues (NANs) and integrase inhibitors. All of them have played \na very important role throughout history [83].\nANs were the beginning of treatment for HIV infection. \nThey were \ufb01rst used as monotherapy, then in dual therapy and even triple therapy. However, suppression of viral replication was suboptimal and clinical bene\ufb01t was limited. Toxicity had a common mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction with var -\nied clinical manifestations. The vast majority of antiretroviral regimens have included AN. ANs are components of standard antiretroviral treatment.\nPIs changed the natural history of HIV infection. Its phar -\nmacokinetics were improved by boosting with low-dose ri -\ntonavir and later with cobicistat. Potentiation allowed PIs to have a high genetic barrier so that resistance mutations were not generated, but also gave them a higher risk of interactions. The toxicity of PIs has generally been digestive and metabol -\nic. Because of their potency and genetic barrier, PIs were the forerunners of the less-than-three-drug regimen. \nNANs have had better tolerability and less risk of inter-\nactions than PIs. In addition, they have a long half-life, which makes them easy to dose. Unlike other groups, the drugs in the NAN group have generally been able to be taken once a day. In addition, their prolonged half-life has meant that suppression of viral replication can be better maintained than with PIs in cases of occasional suboptimal adherence. Therefore, PIs have been used preferentially in \ufb01rst lines of treatment for many years. However, their low genetic barrier is responsible for the emergence of resistance mutations when viral replication is not suppressed. Familial toxicity is hypersensitivity and, in the case of efavirenz, neuropsychological disturbances that may appear late [100].\nIntegrase inhibitors combine favourable characteristics of \nboth PIs (genetic barrier, potency) and NANs (simplicity, tol -\nerability), but also have a faster virological suppressive effect, better long-term tolerability, and little risk of interactions. These are currently the preferred antiretroviral treatment components. Toxicity includes neuropsychological disturbanc -\nes, usually mild and transient, and weight gain.\nConclusion:\nNucleoside analogues are common components of \nantiretroviral therapy. Protease inhibitors have a high po -\ntency and high genetic barrier. Non-nucleoside analogue \ndrugs have a long half-life and simple dosing. Finally, in -Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 145A new highly potent antiretroviral reverse transcriptase \ntranslocation inhibitor (MK-8591) with a half-life of more \nthan 180 days, which could be administered once a year via an implant, is under study. This molecule maintains its activity against viruses with resistance to other reverse transcriptase inhibitors, with mutations such as K65R, M184V or M184I. A single 10 mg dose achieves an average reduction in HIV-1 viral load of 1.6 log in 7 to 10 days [134]. \nThe main challenge for these drugs is to properly assess \nwith which other drugs they should be combined in order to obtain a truly effective ART that can be administered once or twice a year. In this sense, the pharmaceutical industries have a double challenge: on the one hand, to develop the molecule and, on the other hand, to reach agreements with other com -\npanies to build an effective combination.\nFinally, administration of neutralising antibodies adminis -\ntered subcutaneously or intravenously on a regular basis could be another parenteral treatment option, preliminary studies of which have already begun [135].\nConclusion:\nParenteral treatment of HIV infection is a reality that \nwill soon materialise. Its ef\ufb01cacy is similar to conven -\ntional oral treatment and allows patients to receive the \nmedication every 8 weeks. The combination of cabotegra -\nvir and rilpivirine is the most developed so far, but other promising molecules are in development.\nREDUCED DRUG SCHEDULES?\nFederico Pulido\nSince 1996, antiretroviral treatment has consisted of a \ncombination of three drugs. The reason for this number was due to the need to achieve suf\ufb01cient ef\ufb01cacy to suppress vi -\nral replication, without giving the option to select for possible viral variants carrying resistance mutations that would lead to treatment failure, thus maintaining suppression inde\ufb01nite -\nly. As a result, immune impairment was reversed, leading to a dramatic decline in the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection. With the drugs available at the time, this could only be achieved by combining three drugs, although it is true that not all three-drug combinations are equally effec -\ntive. \nThe emergence in later years of more potent antiretroviral \ndrugs with a higher barrier to resistance led to the possibility of using combinations with fewer drugs. This strategy of re -\nducing the number of drugs as long as it does not lead to a loss of ef\ufb01cacy was motivated by the possibility of reducing toxicities (those derived from the drug that is no longer used) and reducing the cost of treatment [136]. \nAttempts to use a single potent drug with a high barrier \nto resistance (boosted protease inhibitor) failed to match the antiviral ef\ufb01cacy achieved with the same drugs in triple com -\nbinations for maintenance of virological suppression. However, suppression was maintained in a high number of patients and who agreed to participate in the study and received CARLA \npreferred the intramuscular regimen to the oral regimen they had taken during induction. Only three patients in the CARLA arm had con\ufb01rmed virological failure with development of re -\nsistance mutations against NNRTI and INSTI. All three patients had the same subtype (A1), a baseline mutation in INSTI (L74I) and concentrations of both drugs below the averages of the treated population. The impact of these \ufb01ndings is being in -\nvestigated, but does not seem likely to change the good results obtained.\nTwo similar studies, but with previously treated patients \nwith undetectable viral load (Atlas Trial -every 4 weeks- and Atlas 2M Trial -every 8 weeks-), i.e. \u201cswitch\u201d studies, have also demonstrated non-inferiority of CARLA to different oral treat-ment regimens based on PIs, NNRTIs or integrase inhibitors. Similarly, the satisfaction of patients treated with CARLA is very high. The frequency of discomfort at the drug injection site was high in the \ufb01rst few injections, but as in previous tri -\nals, tolerance improved over the course of the study. Again, the number of con\ufb01rmed virological failures in the CARLA group was very low (1%), so that only three patients had RPV-resist -\nant mutations, some of which were achieved from the start of treatment [128,129].\nThe Atlas and Flair studies on CARLA have been able to \ndemonstrate that patient adherence has been very high, with up to 98% of injections being administered within the sched -\nuled 7-day window. In addition, none of the patients who re -\nceived treatment beyond 7 days had virological failure. Finally, the possibility of a transitional oral treatment was also ex -\nplored, in case the patient could not receive the intramuscular dosage, and the result has been satisfactory [130]. In addition, the stigma experienced by people living with HIV may be al -\nleviated by the possibility of switching from oral to injectable treatment, particularly when administered as a long-acting treatment such as CARLA [131].\nBut progress does not stop there, that is only the begin -\nning. Ideally, a treatment should be available that can be ad-ministered, or better, self-administered parenterally, e.g. sub -\ncutaneously, or via a slow-release reservoir, every three, six or even twelve months. There are three molecules at different stages of development that could be used in this way. A po-tent capsid inhibitor (GS-6207) with a half-life of more than 24 weeks and activity against virus resistant to other antiret -\nroviral families, which could be administered subcutaneously. This new drug in development has many advantages. Firstly, it has a novel mechanism of action acting on several targets in capsid function; secondly, it could be used in patients previ-ously treated with several families of antiretrovirals and with virus resistant to them; and \ufb01nally, due to its long half-life it would allow administration possibly every 6 months. Results to date suggest that a single dose (50-450mg) of GS-6207 ad -\nministered subcutaneously has potent antiviral activity, with a 1.8-2.2 log10 copy/mL reduction in viral load over 10 days. In addition, the drug was safe, with few mild side effects at the injection site, making it a good candidate for further clinical development [132, 133].Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 146lers. Among the main functions of bNAbs are virus neutralisa -\ntion and Fc-dependent antiviral activity, such as antibody-de -\npendent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [143]. Meanwhile, bNAbs \nsuch as VRC01, 3BNC117 and 10-1074 have been shown to be safe and well tolerated after intravenous infusion [144-146]. They induce a signi\ufb01cant reduction in viraemia and require less continuous administration than cART. However, the protec -\ntion they induce is not long-lasting and regular infusions are necessary. In addition, combinations of several bNAbs should be administered to improve ef\ufb01cacy and avoid the emergence of resistant variants, and it is necessary to assess in advance whether the patient\u2019s viral variants are sensitive to the combi -\nnation of bNAbs [147,148]. On the other hand, bNAbs can be used for the reverse generation of vaccines and the develop-ment of alternative gene therapy strategies to vaccination is being considered [148,149].\nOn the other hand, the mechanisms of infection devel -\noped by HIV lead to a state of immunosuppression that hinders an effective immune response. In this sense, the expression of molecules related to immune control such as CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 have been described as possibly responsible for this im-mune dysfunction during infection. In fact, the expression of these molecules increases during chronic infection and PD-1+ cells contain more viral DNA and RNA [150,151]. Therefore, im -\nmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs) could be useful for boosting an antiviral and antitumour response and have already been used to treat some HIV-related malignancies [152]. Anti-PD-L1 drugs appear to transiently increase CD4 viral transcription, followed by a reduction in plasma viral RNA [141]. Combining pembrolizumab with latency-reversing agents (LRAs) such as bryostatin would increase HIV replication from reservoir cells without activation and proliferation [151].\nTo improve the visibility of reservoir cells, speci\ufb01c markers \nneed to be identi\ufb01ed. CD30 is a marker of latently infected but transcriptionally active cells and could therefore be a thera -\npeutic target for HIV-1 eradication [152]. In fact, treatment with the anti-CD30 antineoplastic drug brentuximab vedotin has been associated with a reduction in plasma viraemia [153]. On the other hand, homeostatic proliferation of the reservoir by cytokines such as IL-7 is one of the main obstacles to HIV-1 eradication. IL-7 levels increase during HIV-associated lym -\nphocytopenia and decrease with immune reconstitution, so administration of IL-7 to aviremic patients increases viral load and CD8 activity [141]. IL-15, another proliferative cytokine produced during acute infection, can also induce NK cell stim -\nulation and proliferation of CD8+ T cells for the destruction of latently infected CD\n4 T cells [154].\nFinally, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used for the treat -\nment of chronic myeloid leukaemia have been shown to have a potent antiviral effect against HIV by acting on different cell types: they prevent ex vivo CD4 infection by preserving the antiviral innate immune factor SAMHD1; interfere with IL-2- and IL-7-induced CD4 homeostatic proliferation, which may prevent reservoir turnover; and induce enhanced cyto-toxic activity by increasing CD56+ and TCR+ cell populations [68,155,156].the small number of patients whose viral load rebounded did \nnot select for resistance [137]. \nTwo-drug strategies have produced heterogeneous re -\nsults, depending mainly on the drugs used in the combi -\nnation and the patient\u2019s therapeutic history[138]. We now have evidence from large randomised clinical trials that some two-drug combinations have the same ef\ufb01cacy in controlling viraemia in previously untreated (na\u00efve) patients and/or main -\ntaining virological control in viraemia-suppressed patients as the best available triple-drug regimens [67,139].\nThese successful two-drug combinations have in com-\nmon the presence of a drug with a high barrier to resistance (a boosted protease inhibitor) and/or a second-generation in-tegrase inhibitor, with the addition of a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nucleoside analogue or non-nucleoside analogue) as a second drug [140].\nToday, therefore, highly (and equally) effective antiretro -\nviral regimens composed of two or three drugs are available, with the ef\ufb01cacy of the regimen depending not on the number of drugs used, but on which drugs are used in the combina -\ntion. The discussion on the required number of drugs [137,138] should therefore be ended, in order to focus on the ef\ufb01cacy and tolerability demonstrated by each speci\ufb01c regimen.\nConclusion: \nIt is no longer the number, but the type of drugs that \ndetermines the effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment. \nWe currently have guidelines with two drugs whose ef\ufb01 -\ncacy and tolerance allow them to be used in clinical prac -\ntice.\nWHAT IS THE FUTURE OF IMMUNOTHERAPY?\nMaye Coiras\nThe progression of HIV infection is highly dependent on \nthe timing of cART initiation as it conditions the preservation of a functional immune response. In fact, the lymphocytopenia and immune dysregulation associated with HIV infection are re -\nsponsible for the development of opportunistic infections and various types of HIV-associated tumours. In particular, during antineoplastic treatment of HIV+ patients with different im-munotherapies, it has been observed that some may be useful against viral persistence by affecting HIV latency mechanisms and activating a speci\ufb01c antiviral immune response [141].\nTo address the different immunotherapy strategies that \nmight be useful for the control of HIV infection, we need to consider the central target of infection: CD4+ T cells. Blocking the binding of the virus to the cell by neutralising antibodies is a potential immunological tool to prevent infection. Approx -\nimately 20% of patients untreated for at least 2 years devel-op broad spectrum neutralising antibodies (bNAbs) that allow cross-neutralisation of different virus types [142]. This is due to the continuous maturation of af\ufb01nity against conserved and accessible Env epitopes that evolve as a result of immune pressure. 1% of patients who develop bNAbs are elite control -Past and future of HIV infection.

Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 147directional and reciprocal communication channels between \npatient, professionals and administration is a pending issue in many parts of our country. The elimination of the existing fragmentation between levels of care and different health pro -\nfessionals and the growing use of new technologies and the e-health revolution will help to make the system more ef\ufb01 -\ncient and encourage self-care with greater co-responsibility and more active patient participation in the management of their health [157,158]. \nThe enormous efforts of scientists in HIV vaccine develop -\nment and eradication of HIV infection make close collaboration between HIV clinicians and basic science researchers essential. \nSpecialists in HIV infection together with other health \nprofessionals and community agents continue to work tire -\nlessly to achieve zero new HIV infections in Spain, to eliminate the stigma associated with HIV infection and to achieve the not impossible, but still distant, eradication of HIV infection.\nConclusion:\nSpecialised HIV units will continue to be indispensa -\nble in the coming years. However, there will be a shift \nfrom the current, exhausted, acute patient-centred model to a more ef\ufb01cient model focused on chronic patient care. Experts should continue to contribute to maintaining the high standards in HIV research.\nWHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE IN HIGH-INCOME \nCOUNTRIES?\nSantiago Moreno\nThe treatment currently prescribed for people with HIV \ninfection is close to optimal, both in absolute terms and rela -\ntive to the treatment of other chronic diseases. HIV infection is \namong the diseases for which treatment is available with the highest rate of therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy and the least toxic effects and the greatest impact on the health status of the recipient. Antiretroviral treatment has not only enabled people with HIV infection to have a life expectancy similar to that of the non-HIV-infected population, but to do so with a good quality of life without limitations that might result from the disease itself or from the medication. \nIn the current situation, it is dif\ufb01cult to improve the treat -\nment of the disease. The prospect of long-acting drugs that will soon allow dosing at extended intervals of several weeks or months will certainly be an improvement, but not a dra-matic change. Improving antiretroviral treatment is not really the most important issue at hand, nor is it the most pressing. The most immediate ambition is to achieve a cure for those infected and, even more ambitiously, the availability of a vac -\ncine whose administration to those at risk would prevent them from becoming infected. These are clearly two outstanding issues in the \ufb01ght against HIV in industrialised countries and globally. Their achievement is not on the near horizon and we are therefore faced with more immediate problems still to be solved.Conclusions\nImmunotherapy should be considered a very impor-\ntant tool for the control of HIV infection. New advanc -\nes in neutralising antibody therapy and its application \nto vaccine development are encouraging, although some issues related to stability and ef\ufb01cacy still need to be ad -\ndressed. On the other hand, immune-enhancing drugs such as immune checkpoint inhibitors could make reser-voir cells visible to the immune system and enhance the antiviral effect of cytotoxic cells, as could tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Improving the immune response is therefore essential for a functional cure of HIV by exerting better control of the reservoir.\nWHAT IS THE FUTURE OF HIV SPECIALISTS?\nJos\u00e9 Ignacio Bernardino\nWith the full implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis, \nearly diagnosis, prompt treatment initiation and combination prevention strategies, new HIV infections will gradually de -\ncline. As has already been demonstrated in other cities such as London, Paris and San Francisco, HIV specialists in HIV units must take the lead in these initiatives together with other health stakeholders and public health of\ufb01cials. An inescapa -\nble and achievable goal is to reach zero new HIV infections in Spain. \nWith the decline in new HIV infections, the need for spe -\ncialised HIV units may be questioned. The stigma associated with the infection, unfortunately still very present in our so -\nciety, together with the general lack of knowledge about HIV infection, even among health professionals, will require the continuity of specialised units. We cannot forget that a sig-ni\ufb01cant proportion of new infections come from vulnerable populations such as transgender women, injection drug users and illegal immigrants, adolescents at risk of social exclusion who are often excluded from the health system and who re -\nceive social and health care in community centres, sexually transmitted disease clinics, drug user centres and specialised HIV units. The maintenance of these centres is essential for the social and health care of these groups.\nAt present, the life expectancy of HIV-infected people is \nsimilar to that of the general population, so the number of people with HIV infection being followed up in the units will be increasing and this translates into a change in care needs. Growing older with HIV infection, the comorbidities associated with this process, and in short, the chronicity of the different pathologies that can converge in a person with HIV infection, requires a multidisciplinary approach that must be coordinated by the HIV infection specialist. This new landscape is a unique opportunity to lead the transformation of the healthcare sys -\ntem from an outdated and hugely expensive acute care model to a more modern day chronic care model. In these models it is essential to place the patient at the centre of care. A model in which the agents involved coordinate and focus their care on the patient, sharing the same information systems with multi-Past and future of HIV infection.

In addition, com -\nbating the stigma and discrimination still faced by people who are HIV-positive is the second major issue that all \ufb01rst world countries have yet to address.\nWHAT REFLECTIONS FROM AN ETHICAL POINT OF \nVIEW ARE RAISED?\nDiego Gracia\nIt is not possible to talk about the ethics of HIV without \nrecalling the heroic years when a clinical AIDS diagnosis meant \na death sentence, usually within fourteen months. This was the case for most of the 1980s. In addition to being an acute and deadly disease, its rapid spread led to it being labelled as \u201cepidemic\u201d, triggering uncontrolled fear among health profes-sionals and the general population, in some cases to the point of panic. In such a critical situation, con\ufb02icts have soared, and so has ethical re\ufb02ection. It was common to see articles on eth -\nics in large clinical journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, JAMA, Lancet or the British Medical Journal, in a previously unknown proportion. In those days it was not uncommon to say that only with the ex -\nample of AIDS was it possible to explain the main chapters of an entire ethics course. There were many very serious problems related to a key element of clinical activity: diagnosis. Thus, whether or not it was obligatory to ask the patient\u2019s permis -\nsion to carry out the diagnostic test, given that the profes -\nsional considered himself to be at risk and therefore believed he was entitled to know if the patient was HIV-positive, even against the patient\u2019s wishes. Another serious problem was that of data con\ufb01dentiality, especially in view of the need to protect patients\u2019 sexual partners. No less serious were the problems re -\nlated to treatment: Were health professionals obliged to assist them, or could they raise any objection? The WHO itself had to intervene by reminding professionals that they were obliged to assist, and that the risk was minimal as long as they took the recommended protective measures into account. Another seri -\nous problem was the dispersion and distribution of treatments when they became accessible, given their high cost. No less serious were the con\ufb02icts that arose with the testing of new antiretroviral drugs in Asian and African countries. And the list could go on.\nToday things are very different. HIV infection has gone \nfrom being an acute to a chronic disease, from epidemic to endemic, and from being seen as a public health issue to a private hygiene problem. The latter is something that is rarely re\ufb02ected upon, yet is becoming increasingly important. I will therefore focus my analysis on this point.\nWestern medicine did not have truly effective therapeutic \nresources, both medical and surgical, until the 19th century. It was then that experimental pharmacology and pharmaco-logical therapeutics appeared as disciplines, and when surgery began to succeed in its incursion into the three cavities of The reality we live in our society, and that of people living \nwith HIV infection in particular, requires solutions to identi -\n\ufb01ed, well-known, unresolved issues. These are issues that have to do with controlling the epidemic in our environment and improving the quality of life of people living with the infec -\ntion. In industrialised countries, there remains a high risk of HIV transmission among people who engage in risky practices, primarily unprotected sex, but also among injecting drug users who share injecting equipment. Whatever the route, transmis -\nsion occurs primarily from people who do not know they are infected and are therefore not receiving antiretroviral treat-ment. Identifying infected persons and administering antiret -\nroviral treatment to achieve control of viral replication could stop transmission, reduce the incidence of new infections and, overall, control the epidemic with all the associated bene\ufb01ts [159]. It is dif\ufb01cult to understand why, having demonstrated the bene\ufb01ts of diagnosing and treating infected persons, the necessary procedures have not been put in place to achieve this goal. At present, most countries, including Spain, rely for diagnosis on the identi\ufb01cation of antecedents or risk practices, which has clearly proved to be insuf\ufb01cient. \nIn order to bring the epidemic under control, it should \nbe noted that the proposed measure of identifying all infect -\ned persons as early as possible and treating them, although the most important, is not suf\ufb01cient. In the meantime, oth -\ner measures are needed to limit the transmission of the virus. An effective method of prevention has also been described for this. PrEP has shown ef\ufb01cacy in preventing infection in unin -\nfected people who engage in risky practices not only in clinical trials, but also in real life. Recent population-based experience has shown that PrEP administration is associated with a sig-ni\ufb01cant decrease in the incidence of HIV infection, regardless of the percentage of patients with an undetectable viral load [160]. In Spain, this measure has been approved.\nImproving the quality of life of people with HIV infection, \nwhich is another un\ufb01nished business, has nothing to do with the quality of life associated with health status. People on an -\ntiretroviral treatment are healthy enough to lead normal so -\ncial, family and working lives. The quality of life they lack is related to the stigma attached to being HIV-positive and the discrimination they face at many levels, creating real social inequalities [161]. Again, it is inexplicable that in \u201c\ufb01rst world\u201d countries, suffering from a chronic illness can become a reason for discrimination. In this case, the way to combat it is more complex, but it is undoubtedly where a society such as ours is most likely to demonstrate the ability to solve problems that are not easy and that affect a large number of people.\nConclusion: \nIn neighbouring countries, HIV infection still presents \nchallenges that have not yet been overcome. Beyond the \nlimited room for improvement in antiretroviral therapy or the achievement of desired HIV cures and vaccines, so-ciety and people living with HIV infection need action to achieve urgent goals. Control of the epidemic in an en-vironment such as ours can be achieved if measures of Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 149the coup de grace in the middle of the same century with \nthe appearance of penicillin. This was so revolutionary that the 1960s witnessed a profound change in social and cultural habits known as the \u201csexual revolution\u201d. The old controls were relaxed, and \u201crepression\u201d was replaced by permissiveness or \u201csexual freedom\u201d. From one extreme to the other... Until 1981, when HIV infection appeared on the horizon. It started out as a very acute and aggressive disease, which medicine had to control, of course, through new therapies. And this it did. The pace of new drugs and their increasing ef\ufb01cacy has dramati -\ncally changed the landscape of the disease over the course of a few decades. But medicine is not \ufb01nished with it. What has been achieved thus far was its transformation from an acute to a chronic disease. It would therefore seem that the time had come to turn to the strategies that are most appropri -\nate and effective in this type of disease: those that have to do with lifestyle and risk practices. It was time to remember the old story of sex res unnatural. By then, however, the old historical references had been lost, and there was a growing conviction that HIV infection was a purely medical, or rather a pharmacological, problem. Instead of acting on risky prac -\ntices, it was suf\ufb01cient to protect oneself by using chemical, physical or pharmacological agents.\nIt is doubtful that this is the only, let alone the most ap -\npropriate strategy to control this infection. Some data are alarming to say the least. One of them is the change in leisure practices, shifting from daytime to night-time, in which in or -\nder to resist the fatigue of a sleepless night it is necessary to drink alcohol (\u201cbinge drinking\u201d) and take stimulant drugs, which in turn diminish self-control, disinhibit sexuality and lead to irresponsible practices which, moreover, tend to be practised in groups, thus producing the \u201cherd\u201d effect, in which individ -\nual responsibility is diluted within the group dynamic. All this leads to an irresponsible management of the body, consump -\ntion, and sexuality. In the latter, from \u201csexual repression\u201d one moves to \u201csexual disinhibition\u201d, which uses the other person as an object, or as Kant would say, as a pure \u201cmeans\u201d and not as an \u201cend\u201d in itself. Humans are moral and not merely natural beings, precisely because we have the status of an \u201cend\u201d and not merely a \u201cmeans\u201d to be used at the whim of others. Sexu -\nality, like food and alcohol, must be managed wisely. Prudence is the capacity for self-control, and it is responsibility in the management of one\u2019s actions and life. And it is also health, private health, something that needs to be promoted through education; through education in general, and also through health education. Health professionals are also educators, and in matters such as those we are analysing here, essential edu -\ncators. The aim of medicine is not only to cure disease, but to promote health and the prudent and responsible management of the body. At a time when we are approaching the ideal of precision medicine or personalised medicine, we cannot forget that there will be no personalised medicine without educating people in the responsible and prudent management of their bodies and sexuality. This is something that the ancient physi -\ncians knew very well, and which today\u2019s therapeutic potential is unfortunately making us forget.the human body, the abdominal, thoracic and cranial cavities, \nthanks to the three great novelties introduced in the second half of the century: antisepsis and asepsis, anaesthesia and haemostasis. For the \ufb01rst time in history, the doctor saw him -\nself as being able to cure diseases. Add to this that from the end of the 18th century, as a consequence of enlightened des -\npotism, governments began to turn health into a political ob -\njective, which led to the birth of what was \ufb01rst called Sanitary Police and later Sanitary Policy or Public Health.\nThis revolution was so far-reaching that the strategies \ndeveloped by physicians from antiquity until the end of the 18th century were no longer of interest. Given their very limit -\ned therapeutic arsenal, classical physicians sought above all to promote the health of the population by means of very sim-ple and elementary procedures for promoting private hygiene, i.e. health education. Based on a Hippocratic treatise entitled On Airs, Waters and Places, the physicians gradually drew up a catalogue of six major chapters for the promotion of private hygiene. This is what was known in the Middle Ages as the catalogue of unnatural sex res non naturals. The six chapters were: environment (what the Hippocratic writing On Airs, Wa -\nters and Places referred to), food and drink (cibus et potus), movement and rest (motus et quies), sleep and wakefulness (somnus et vigilia), excretions and secretions (excreta et secre -\nta) and psychic disorders (affectus animi). Prudent manage -\nment of these six major chapters was the best way to promote health and prevent disease. Especially chronic disease, because chronic disease has a lot to do with unwise lifestyle manage -\nment. If a person frequently overeats, he or she will almost certainly become overweight, which in turn predisposes him or her to certain chronic diseases, such as type II diabetes.\nAs hardly anyone remembers this history anymore, it is \nworth pointing out that this catalogue was fully valid until the end of the 18th century, and that in the last two hun-dred years that it has been losing importance in the estimation of doctors, given the progress of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques and the no lesser increase in public hygiene, until it has practically disappeared. However, it is still valid in the case of chronic illnesses, as these are most often caused precisely by a disorder of habits, i.e. lifestyle habits.\nHIV infection is now a chronic disease, one of the so-\ncalled \u201csexually transmitted diseases\u201d (STDs). These diseases also have a long history, from which we can perhaps learn something. For example, we can learn from the fact that they were called \u201cmoral, secret or shameful diseases\u201d. Moral diseas -\nes were not so much because they were against good morals, but because they were caused by the disorder of what Lat -\nin-speakers called mores, customs. They were diseases directly related to lifestyle habits. This is why they were placed, within the catalogue of unnatural sex res non naturals mentioned above, in the chapter entitled excreta et secreta. These were not exclusively medical problems, but primarily social and cultural issues. The paradigmatic example of STDs during the modern centuries was syphilis. It began to be controlled at the beginning of the 20th century with the appearance of the \ufb01rst synthetic chemotherapy drug, salvarsan, and was given Past and future of HIV infection.

Conclusion:\nThe enormous effectiveness of therapeutics, both \npharmacological and surgical, and the healthcare impor -\ntance of public health programmes and health policy, is \nmaking us forget something that in traditional medicine was the most important objective of the practitioner\u2019s action: namely, education and promotion of private hy-giene. This is worth remembering at a time when HIV in-fection is no longer an acute and potentially life-threat -\nening disease, but a chronic disease, where it is essential that patients learn to manage their bodies wisely and re -\nsponsibly, normalising their behaviour and avoiding risky practices. \nFUNDING\nFor transparency purposes, we would like to inform you \nthat GSK has contributed to the funding of this publication.

Health and non-health workers (H &NH-W) \nin a hospital are more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection than \nthe general population. We studied the prevalence of this in-fection in these workers of Segovia\u00b4s Hospital after the \ufb01rst epidemic wave.\nMaterial and methods. Monocentric, observational, \ncross-sectional study, carried out between April 29 and May 14, 2020. The infection was diagnosed by capillary immuno -\nchromatography test for IgG and / or IgM antibodies, or PCR. Work, health, and exposure variables were studied.\nResults. A total of 1,335 H\n&NH-W participated in the \nstudy out of a total of 1,667 (80.1%), 79.3% women, with a mean age of 47.3 years, and 47.1 for men. The prevalence of infected was 21.95%, 24.7% asymptomatic. Age presented a signi\ufb01cant OR of 1.02/year. Exposure outside of work increased the prevalence by 16.8%. The continued use of Personal Pro-tective Equipment (PPE) and the administration of nebuliza -\ntions presented an OR of 0.54 and 0.46 respectively. The symp -\ntoms associated with the highest prevalence were anosmia (OR 9.31), ageusia (OR 3.05), and fever (OR 1.94). Today, about 75% of H\n&NH-W were infected in the \ufb01rst wave.\nConclusions. The prevalence is higher among healthcare \nworkers than the population they serve. Age is associated with a higher prevalence of infection. Almost a quarter of those infected were asymptomatic. The continuous use of PPE was associated with a lower prevalence, for that the administration of nebulisations could be safe. The symptoms with the greatest association were fever, anosmia, and ageusia.\nKeywords: Coronavirus Infections, Prevalence, Cross-Sectional Studies, \nHospital Personnel, Risk FactorsPrevalencia de infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2 durante \nla primera oleada de la pandemia entre personal sanitario y no sanitario del Hospital General de Segovia, Castilla y Le\u00f3n\n1Servicio de Urgencias.

Los trabajadores sanitarios y no sanitarios \n(TSyNS) de un hospital est\u00e1n m\u00e1s expuestos al contagio por \nSARS-CoV-2 que la poblaci\u00f3n general. Estudiamos la prevalen -\ncia de esta infecci\u00f3n en los trabajadores del hospital de Sego -\nvia tras la primera ola.\nMaterial y m\u00e9todos. Estudio monoc\u00e9ntrico, observacio-\nnal, transversal, realizado entre el 29 de abril y el 14 de mayo de 2020. Se diagnostic\u00f3 la infecci\u00f3n mediante test de inmuno -\ncromatograf\u00eda capilar para anticuerpos IgG y/o IgM, o PCR. Se estudiaron variables laborales, de salud, y de exposici\u00f3n.\nResultados. Participaron en el estudio 1.335 TSyNS de un \ntotal 1.667 (80,1%), un 79,3% mujeres, con una edad media de 47,3 a\u00f1os, y de 47,1 para los hombres. La prevalencia de infec -\ntados fue del 21,95%, el 24,7% asintom\u00e1ticos. La edad presen -\nt\u00f3 una OR signi\ufb01cativa de 1,02/a\u00f1o. La exposici\u00f3n extralaboral aument\u00f3 la prevalencia un 16,8%. El uso continuado del Equi -\npo de Protecci\u00f3n Individual (EPI) y la administraci\u00f3n de nebu -\nlizaciones presentaron una OR de 0,54 y 0,46 respectivamente. Los s\u00edntomas asociados a mayor prevalencia fueron anosmia (OR 9,31), ageusia (OR 3,05), y \ufb01ebre (OR 1,94). Hasta la fecha, el 75% de los TSyTNS infectados lo hicieron en la primera ola.\nConclusiones. La prevalencia es mayor entre los TSyNS \nque en la poblaci\u00f3n general. La edad se asocia a una mayor prevalencia de infecci\u00f3n. Casi un 25% de los infectados fue asintom\u00e1tico. El uso de EPI de forma continuada se asoci\u00f3 a menor prevalencia. Los s\u00edntomas con mayor asociaci\u00f3n fueron \ufb01ebre, anosmia, y ageusia.\nPalabras clave: Infecci\u00f3n por coronavirus, prevalencia, estudio transversal, \npersonal hospitalario, factores de riesgo.\nCorrespondencia:\nJulio C\u00e9sar Santos PastorHospital General de Segovia.

DISCUSI\u00d3N\nHemos encontrado una elevada prevalencia de TSyNS in -\nfectados por SARS-CoV-2 al \ufb01nal de la primera ola epid\u00e9mica \nde la pandemia, similar a la registrada entre la totalidad del personal sanitario en Espa\u00f1a (RENAVE), y que se sit\u00faa entre las m\u00e1s altas de las publicadas entre trabajadores hospita-larios: 11,2% en personal sanitario en el Hospital Cl\u00ednico de Barcelona [11], 19,99% en personal sanitario en el Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada [9], o el 33,1% en personal sa -\nnitario y no sanitario del Hospital Universitario Fundaci\u00f3n Alcorc\u00f3n [12]. Casi la totalidad trabajadores del hospital se contagiaron durante la primera ola de la pandemia (un 2% durante los 17 meses siguientes). Esta elevada prevalencia contrasta con la hallada en el estudio de seroprevalencia en Prevalencia de infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2 durante la primera oleada de la pandemia entre personal sanitario \ny no sanitario del Hospital General de Segovia, Castilla y Le\u00f3nC.

En concordancia con este hecho hemos observado \nque uso del EPI se asocia con una menor prevalencia de con -\ntagio. Y \u00e9ste fen\u00f3meno podr\u00eda explicar tambi\u00e9n la menor pre -\nvalencia entre trabajadores que administraron tratamiento ne -\nbulizado, un procedimiento que a priori deber\u00eda tener un efecto contrario por la elevada generaci\u00f3n de aerosoles. Creemos que cuando administraba tratamiento nebulizado el trabajador ten\u00eda una percepci\u00f3n de mayor riesgo de contagio, y por ello pudo tener mayor diligencia en la utilizaci\u00f3n de los EPI y/o redujo el tiempo que permaneci\u00f3 en la sala donde se administraban.\nLa elevada proporci\u00f3n de trabajadores infectados sin s\u00edn -\ntomas es importante porque contribuy\u00f3 a la propagaci\u00f3n de la infecci\u00f3n. No podemos determinar cu\u00e1ntos de los trabajadores infectados asintom\u00e1ticos lo eran realmente o se encontraban en per\u00edodo pre-sintom\u00e1tico. Sin embargo, los estudios publica -\ndos indican que, salvo en personas de edad avanzada, el por -\ncentaje de infectados asintom\u00e1ticos que desarrollan s\u00edntomas m\u00e1s adelante es muy peque\u00f1o [14].\nLa infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2 en TSyNS de nuestro centro \nhospitalario parece ser un riesgo ocupacional, sin que hayamos encontrado diferencias entre categor\u00edas profesionales, servi-cios, ni duraci\u00f3n de la jornada. Incluso los trabajadores que no realizaron atenci\u00f3n directa a pacientes con COVID-19 presen -\ntan una elevada prevalencia de infecci\u00f3n. La edad es una varia -\nble asociada a mayor prevalencia de infecci\u00f3n. El uso general y continuado del EPI es una medida eficaz para reducir el riesgo de contagio. No hemos encontrado relaci\u00f3n entre prevalen -\ncia, variables de salud, ni grupo sangu\u00edneo.

The aim of our study was to analyze sonication \nand Maki techniques for diagnosis of catheter tip colonization \nand catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) on patients admitted to ICU. \nMaterial and methods. Observational and prospective \nstudy in one Intensive Care Unit. Patients with some central venous catheter (CVC) at least for 7 days and catheter-related infection (CRI) suspicion (new episode of fever or sepsis) were included. We performed Maki technique followed by sonica-tion of catheter tip. We compared area under the curve (AUC) of Maki, sonication, and techniques combination to diagnosis catheter tip colonization and CRBSI.\nResults. We included 94 CVC from 87 CRI suspicion epi -\nsodes. We found 14 cases of catheter tip colonization and 10 cases of CRBSI. Of the 14 catheter tip colonization cases, 7 (50.0%) were detected by Maki and sonication techniques, 6 (42.9%) were detected only by Maki technique, and 1 (7.1%) was detected only by sonication technique. Of the 10 CRBSI, 6 (60.0%) were detected by Maki and sonication techniques, 4 (40.0%) were detected only by Maki technique, and any only by sonication technique. We found higher AUC in Maki technique than in sonication technique to diagnosis of CRBSI (p=0.02) and to diagnosis of catheter tip colonization (p=0.03). No signi\ufb01cant differences were found in AUC between Maki technique and combination techniques for diagnosis of cathe -\nter tip colonization (p=0.32) and of CRBSI (p=0.32).\nConclusion.: Sonication did not provide reliability to Maki \ntechnique for diagnosis of catheter tip colonization and CRBSI.\nKeywords: Sonication, Maki, colonization, bloodstream infection\nCorrespondence:\nLeonardo Lorente.Intensive Care Unit.

CRI sus -\npicion was stablished when a patient developed a new episode of sepsis or fever. We de\ufb01ned sepsis according to Sepsis-3 Con -\nsensus criteria of 2016 [16]. We considered fever when temper -\nature was \u226538\u00baC. \nVariables recorded. We recorded the following variables \nfor each patient: Sex, age, admission diagnostic, diabetes mel -\nlitus, asthma, chronic liver disease, smoking, chronic obstruc -\ntive pulmonary disease (COPD), human immunode\ufb01ciency virus, hematological tumor, solid tumor. Also, we registered the use of renal replacement therapy, parenteral nutrition, corticosteroids or, immunosuppressive therapy previously to admission. In addition, we recorded the use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive therapy, parenteral nutrition, propofol or renal replacement therapy at moment of CRI suspicion. Fi -\nnally, we also registered site of CVC, time of CVC, and death at 30 days. \nSample collections. The following samples were col -\nlected from each patient: paired blood samples, catheter-tip and other clinical samples. Paired blood samples were taken from peripheral vein, with 10 ml blood sample in each one and separated by 15 minutes. Catheter-tip sample was taken af -\nter scrubbing the skin surrounding the insertion site with 2% chlorhexidine and cutting off the tip (distal 5-cm segment) using sterile scissors. First, we performed catheter-tip cul -\nture using the Maki\u00b4s technique and then sonication. Maki\u2019s semi-quantitative technique was performed by rolling each catheter tip to a blood agar plate [5]. Sonication quantitative technique was performed by placing small fragments of cath -\neter tip in 1 mL of brain-heart infusion broth, then vortexing, sonicating for 1 min (at 35 000 Hz and 125 W), and vortex -\ning for 15 seconds. Finally, 0.1 mL of the sonicated broth was streaked onto sheep blood agar plates [13]. Patients without blood culture, Maki\u2019s technique and sonication technique were excluded of the analysis.\nDe\ufb01nitions. European Centre for Disease Prevention \nand Control (ECDC) criteria were used to de\ufb01ne infections [17]. We considered catheter-tip colonization as a sig -\nni\ufb01cant growth of a microorganism on the CVC tip by the semi-quantitative method of Maki et al (\u2265 15 colony-forming \nunits) [5] or by the quantitative method of sonication ( \u2265100 \ncolony-forming units) [13]. CRBSI was de\ufb01ned as a positive blood culture by recognized pathogen, CVC tip colonization with the same microorganism and no other apparent infec -\ntion source. We de\ufb01ned bloodstream infection of unknown origin (BSIUO) as bloodstream veri\ufb01ed during survey and no source found. Primary bloodstream infection (PBSI) includ-INTRODUCTION\nThe use of a central venous catheter (CVC) may be needed \ndue to different motives, such as the administration of \ufb02uids, \nblood products, parenteral nutrition, medications, or the mon-itorization of hemodynamic status. However, the use of those devices has different risks such as catheter related blood -\nstream infection (CRBSI), which leads to an increase of mor-bidity, mortality and assistant costs [1-4].\nThe semiquantitative technique of Maki et al is considered \nthe reference standard to demonstrate catheter tip colonization due to its simplicity [5]. However, a potential disadvantage lies is that as it consists in rolling the catheter tip across the agar then could detect microorganism of external catheter tip surface but could not detect microorganism of internal catheter tip surface. Thus, Maki\u2019s technique could give false negative of catheter tip colonization for patients with colonization by an endoluminal mechanism. The possible superiority of quantitative techniques (sonication and vortexing) to catheter tip colonization diagnosis in respect to Maki technique lies of their potential ability to detect catheter tip colonization by exoluminal and also by endoluminal mechanism [6-9]. However, all quantitative methods are time-consuming and due to this its use has not widespread stablished in clinical microbiology laboratories.\nThere are scarce data about the reliability comparison be -\ntween Maki\u2019s semiquantitative technique and sonication quan -\ntitative method for detection of CRBSI [10-13]. Some studies concluded that Maki and sonication methods exhibited similar reliability [10-12] and in one study was found the potential bene\ufb01t of sonication jointly with Maki method [13].\nRecent guidelines for the diagnosis of intravascular cath -\neter- related infection (CRI) recommended that semiquantita -\ntive catheter culture by Maki technique and quantitative cath-eter segment culture by sonication have the same strength of the recommendations and quality of the evidence, which is of A-II [14,15].\nPrevious studies analyzing sonication and Maki techniques \nhave included CVC from any patient admitted to the hospital and CVC removed due to any motive [10-13]. However, there has been not analyzed sonication and Maki techniques includ -\ning only CVC from patients admitted to ICU, and CVC removed for catheter-related infection (CRI) suspicion after at least 7 days with that CVC. Therefore, the novel objective of our study was to analyze sonication and Maki techniques including only CVC from patients admitted to ICU, in whom CVC was removed for CRI suspicion, and remained at least 7 days with that CVC.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nDesign and subjects.  A prospective and observational study \nwas carried out between June 2020 and March 2021 after the approval by the Institutional Ethic Review Board of the Hospital Universitario de Canarias (Tenerife, Spain).

We carried out receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses to diagnosis of catheter tip colonization and of CRBSI by Maki, sonication and combination of both techniques. Comparison of area under the curve (AUC) of ROC curves was carried out using the method of DeLong et al. [18]. We considered a difference as statistically signi\ufb01cant when p-values were <0.05.

Some of those studies concluded that Maki and sonication methods exhibited simi-lar reliability [10-12] and in one study was found the poten -\ntial bene\ufb01t of sonication jointly with Maki method [13]. In the study by Guembe et al [13] were included 252 CVCs and the authors found a colonization rate of 14.3% (36/252) and a CRBSI rate of 5.9% (15/252). Of the 36 CVC colonizations, 21 (58.3%) were detected by Maki and sonication, 6 (16.7%) on -\nly by Maki technique, and 9 (25.0%) only by sonication tech -\nnique. Of 15 CRBSI, 11 cases (73.3%) were detected by Maki and sonication, and 4 cases (26.7%) only by sonication tech -\nnique [13]. The authors concluded that both techniques are complementary and they recommended sonicating fragments RESULTS\nWe included 94 CVC from 87 patients with CRI suspicion. \nWe found 23 PBSI, 10 (43.5%) were CRBSI and 13 (56.5%) \nwere BSIUO. We no found signi\ufb01cant differences between group of CVC developing CRBSI (n=10) and no developing it (n=84) in rate of death (p=0.99), time of CVC, site of CVC, and in other variables (Table 1). Neither we found signi\ufb01cant differ -\nences between group of CVC developing PBSI (n=23) and no developing it (n=71) in rate of death (p=0.99), time of CVC, site of CVC, and in other variables (Table 1).\nWe found 14 cases of catheter tip colonization of which \n10 were cases of CRBSI.

Lorente, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 165-170 169of patients with bacteremia of unknown origin and a negative \ncatheter tip culture by the Maki technique [13]. \nWe only found one catheter tip colonization by sonication \nthat was not detected by Maki technique, and this colonization was not responsible of CRBSI. We found higher AUC in Maki technique than in sonication technique for diagnosis of cathe-ter tip colonization and of CRBSI, and no signi\ufb01cant differenc -\nes were found in AUC between Maki technique and combina-tion techniques for diagnosis of catheter tip colonization and of CRBSI. Thus, in our study, the use of sonication no added any rentability in the diagnosis of CRBSI by Maki technique. \nThe different results obtained between Gembe et al [13] \nand our study would be explained because in that study, CVC were collected from a general population (which included ICU and non-ICU adult patients) and CVC had different catheter duration (short and long-term). However, in our study CVC were collected from ICU adult patients and were mainly short term (which have mainly an extraluminal colonization). As sonication is more reliable to detect intraluminal colonization (which appears over all in long-term catheters), it may have no impact at all in the present study, which only included CVC from ICU adult patients, that were mainly short term, which most would be most detected by Maki technique.\nRecent guidelines for CRI diagnosis recommended that \nsemiquantitative catheter culture by Maki technique and quantitative catheter segment culture by sonication have the same strength of the recommendations and quality of the ev-idence [4,15]. We think that the greater simplicity of Maki\u2019s semiquantitative technique, the results of our study and the results of other studies makes Maki procedure as the technique of choice for routine work in the microbiology laboratory, and that the use of sonication technique did not provide pro\ufb01tabil-ity to the Maki technique for the diagnosis of CRBSI. Skin-col-onizing microorganisms (as coagulase-negative staphylococci) are more likely to colonize the external surface of catheter and are the most isolated microorganism in the series, and this fact would explain the absence of pro\ufb01tability of sonication in ICU patients.\nSome limitations must be recognized in our study. First, we \nhave not taken other quantitative techniques (as vortexing) to compare its pro\ufb01tability for CRBSI diagnosis with Maki tech -\nnique and sonication. Second, we have not reported what pro -\nportion of CVC were excluded due to have not all culture (blood, Maki technique and sonication technique). Third, sonication was performed after Maki technique in all catheter tip; thus, Maki technique could cause a great loose of microbial load (as bac -\nteria were already discharged by Maki) and sonication would be in disadvantage. Fourth, the sample size of our study could be relatively low; however, it was enough to \ufb01nd that higher AUC in techniques combination than in sonication technique and in Maki technique than in sonication technique for diagnosis of catheter tip colonization and of CRBSI. The sample size to \ufb01nd higher signi\ufb01cant AUC in techniques combination than in Maki technique was of 220 CVC for diagnosis of catheter tip coloniza -\ntion and of 5,235 CVC for diagnosis CRBSI.The novel aspect of our study was that we analyzed son-\nication and Maki techniques including only CVC from patients \nadmitted to ICU, in whom CVC was removed for CRI suspicion, and remained at least 7 days with that CVC. In our study, soni -\ncation did not provide reliability to Maki\u00b4s technique for CRBSI diagnosis.\nFUNDING\nThis study was supported by a grant from Fundaci\u00f3n DISA \na la Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica 2019 (Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) is a com -\nmon cause of bacterial keratitis in certain geographic areas. A \nhigh percentage of resistance to methicillin is shown, which gives it cross resistance to beta-lactams and sometimes resist -\nance to other antibacterial groups. We analyzed clinical and microbiological variables in patients with infectious keratitis due to SE.\nMethods. Medical records of 43 patients with suspect -\ned infectious keratitis and microbiological con\ufb01rmation for SE, between October 2017 and October 2020, were retrospective -\nly studied. Clinical characteristics (risk factors, size of lesions, treatment, evolution) and microbiological (susceptibility to antibiotics) were analyzed, and groups of patients with me -\nthicillin-resistant (MRSE) and methicillin-susceptible (MSSE) infection were compared.\nResults. MRSE was present in 37.2% of infectious ker -\natitis. All isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid. Rates of resistance to tetracyclines and cipro\ufb02oxacin were 50% and 56% in the MRSE group, and 11% and 7% in the MSSE group. The clinical characteristics, including size of le -\nsion, visual axis involvement, in\ufb02ammation of anterior cham-ber, presence of risk factors and follow-up time, did not show statistically signi\ufb01cant differences between groups.\nConclusions. MRSE is a common cause of infectious ker -\natitis caused by SE and shows a high rate of multidrug resist -\nance. Clinically, it does not differ from MSSE keratitis.

All \nsamples were collected in the ophthalmology unit by corne -\nal scraping procedure, direct inoculation onto appropriate culture media [3] and rapid shipment (within 2 hours) to the microbiology laboratory. Blood and chocolate agar plates were incubated in 10% carbon dioxide environments at 35\u00b0C for 5-7 days. To exclude accidental contaminants, the criterion to consider a positive culture was the monomicrobial growth of at least 10 colonies on a solid medium with similar mor -\nphology to the Gram stain. Cultures that isolated multiple organisms were excluded. Bacterial identi\ufb01cation was carried out using MALDI-TOF technology (Bruker Daltonics). Antibiotic susceptibility studies were performed by broth microdilution (MicroScan, Beckman) and the minimum inhibitory concen -\ntrations (MIC) obtained were interpreted according to EUCAST guidelines. Antibiotics analyzed in all isolated bacterial strains were: cloxacillin, cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, clindamycin, cipro\ufb02oxacin, vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, tetracycline, rifampin, fusidic acid, mupirocin, chloramphenicol, and gen -\ntamicin.\nTreatment and follow-up. After diagnosis, patients were \nempirically treated hourly, according to American Academy of Ophthalmology, with forti\ufb01ed eye drops of ceftazidime (50mg/ml) and vancomycin (50mg/ml), or ceftazidime (50mg/ml) and tobramycin (50mg/ml), or with \ufb02uoroquinolones (3-5mg/ml), along with cyclopentolate 10 mg/ml every 8 hours; the \ufb01nal treatment decision was made according to physician\u2019s discre -\ntion.\nThe \ufb01rst check-up was carried out 48 hours after the diag -\nnosis in all cases, and at this time the evolution was classi\ufb01ed as either good or suboptimal. The patients were followed-up and days until resolution of lesion (absence of \ufb02uorescein cor-neal lesion\u2019s staining and absence of in\ufb02ammation signs) were counted.\nStatistical analysis. All the statistical analyses were \nperformed using SPSS, Version 27, computer software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Binary variables were analysed using chi-square or Fisher\u2019s exact test (when expected value <5). Quan-titative variables were analyzed with t-test when assuming normal distribution of the data and U-Mann-Whitney when it was not.\nA p-value <0.05 was considered statistically signi\ufb01cant. \nAntibiotic resistance was calculated in percentages. \nRESULTS\nDuring the study period, forty-three patients with clinical INTRODUCTION\nGram-positive bacteria are the most common culture-iso -\nlated microorganisms in bacterial keratitis according to sev -\neral series [1-4]. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\n(MRSA) keratitis has been widely described [5-8]. However, literature related to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epi-\ndermidis (MRSE) is limited. Goodman et al. \ufb01rst reported two cases of MRSE keratitis in 1988 [9]. The prevalence has in -\ncreased since then as showed in larger epidemiological studies, ranging from 34 to 79% [2,3,10].\nS. epidermidis  is opportunistic bacteria found in the \nnormal skin microbiota and frequently acquires resistance to antibiotics [11-13]. MRSE is resistant to beta-lactams and frequently acquires resistance to other antibiotics for ophthal -\nmological use such as quinolones or tetracyclines. At sites with poor immunosurveillance, such as foreign bodies, MRSE can cause infections and develop bio\ufb01lms, making it dif\ufb01cult for antibiotics to interact with bacteria, increasing their resistance and making treatment more dif\ufb01cult [14]. The intact cornea and tear layer create a physical immune barrier that prevents opportunistic microorganisms, with limited pathogenicity, from causing infections, which is critical due to the almost complete absence of leukocytes in the tear \ufb02uid and corneal layer [15,16]. However, damage to this barrier facilitates mi -\ncroorganisms penetration and, consequently, infection.\nWe present the clinical characteristics, antibiotic resist -\nance, and treatment results of patients with culture-con\ufb01rmed MRSE keratitis compared to those with methicillin-sensitive S. \nepidermidis keratitis (MSSE) who attended the Ophthalmology Service in a period of three years.\nMETHODS\nCorneal scrape samples were reviewed retrospectively at \nthe Microbiology Service of the Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario of Valencia during the period between October-2017 and Oc -\ntober-2020.\nAll cases were diagnosed on the \ufb01rst visit as suspected in -\nfectious keratitis after slit lamp examination. The criteria consid -\nered were conventional: corneal lesion with stromal in\ufb01ltration (with or without cells in the anterior chamber), pain, discomfort and redness, together with the patient\u2019s anamnesis including previous ocular risk factors [1]. To avoid including colonization samples in our study, we included only symptomatic patients with in\ufb02ammation signs in slit lamp examination.\nPatients with monomicrobial culture for S. epidermid-\nis and compatible clinical manifestations were included. The clinical history, microbiological results and available slit lamp photographs of all patients were reviewed. Clinical informa -\ntion collected included: patient\u2019s age and sex, ocular risk fac -\ntors, number of follow-up days required, size of the lesion at the time of diagnosis, visual axis involvement and clinical out-comes. All patients were managed in the outpatient clinic.\nPatients were divided into severe and non-severe infec -Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis infectious keratitis: Clinical and microbiological pro\ufb01le L.

Ocular or systemic \npredisposing factors were present in 33 cases (76.7%). The risk factors include: eyelid malposition, keratopathy, traumatism, contact lens use, none and other (including antiglaucomatous topical medication, intellectual disability, systemic immunosup -\npression and chronic lacrimal obstruction). The MRSE keratitis are most commonly associated with eyelid malposition (31%) and previous keratopathy (25%) (Figure 1). The MSSE keratitis\u2019 main risk factors are contact lens use (34%) and keratopathy (11%). Only 13% of cases in the MRSE group occurs without predisposing conditions, whereas 31% in the MSSE group.\nMRSE group (n= 16). Fourteen cases of 16 (87.5%) oc -\ncurred in eyes with previous risk factors or systemic predispos -\ning conditions such as: lagophthalmos (3), contact lens use (2), neurotrophic keratopathy (2), distichiasis (2), traumatism (1), bullous keratopathy (1), penetrant keratoplasty (1), intellectu -\nal disability (1) and chronic use of antiglaucomatous topical medication (1). In 2 cases no prior risk factors were identi\ufb01ed.\nThe outcomes were: corneal thinning (2), central leucoma \naffecting visual axis (2), penetrant keratoplasty (1) and total corneal opacity (1). The other 10 cases resolved without func -\ntional sequelae. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics are shown in Table 1.\nMSSE group (n= 27). Eight of the 27 cases (29,6%) did \nnot present ocular risk factors or systemic conditions. The risk diagnosis of keratitis showed a monomicrobial culture for S.\nepidermidis, 16 of which were resistant to methicillin (37.2%).\nFour patients were excluded due to probable contamina -\ntion: three cases had clinically small marginal in\ufb01ltrates asso -\nciated with an epithelial defect and were mildly symptomatic, and the other case had a spongy margin ulcer and torpid evo -\nlution, in which subsequent cultures were positive for Asper-\ngillus.\nPatient characteristics. Patient\u2019s mean age was 55.1 \nyears, ranging from 11 to 89 years (MRSE group: 62.6 years, range 23-82 years; MSSE group: 50.7 years, range 11-89 years; p = 0.094). Twenty-two patients were women (51.2%), with no statistical differences between the two S. epidermidis groups.\nClinical characteristics. All cases presented with pain \nand redness of the affected eye, along with one or more ep -\nithelial defects and perilesional stromal in\ufb01ltration. \nThe mean size of the lesion in maximum and minimum \ndiameter was 1.68x1.05mm (MRSE group: 2.1x1.17mm; MSSE group 1.44x0.97mm; p=0.102 for maximum diameter and p=0.812 for minimum diameter).\nTwenty-one patients (48,8%) presented with in\ufb02amma -\ntion in the anterior chamber (MRSE group: n=10, 62.5%; MSSE group: n=11, 40.1%; p=0.083). Five patients had dense stromal edema, making the assessment of the anterior chamber impos -\nsible with slit lamp examination. Twenty-nine patients (67.4%) were classi\ufb01ed after with criteria of severe keratitis (MRSE group: n=13, 81.3%; MSSE group: n=16, 59.3%; p=0.186). The lesion affected the visual axis in 15 cases (MRSE group: n=6, 37.5%; MSSE group: n=9, 33.3%; p=0.782).\nAll cases were unilateral, suggesting local risk factors \nrather than systemic conditions.Figure 1  Risk factors of MRSE and MSSE keratitis cases.Eyelid malposition\nKeratopathyTraumatismContact lens useNoneOther\n31%\n34%8%11%8%8%MSSE\n13%\n13%\n12%\n6% 25%31%MRSE\nMRSE: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis , MSSE: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis .Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis infectious keratitis: Clinical and microbiological pro\ufb01le L.

The rest (9, 82%) were adjusted after antibiogram results. 1 was changed to forti\ufb01ed vancomycin after showing resistance to the other antibiotics commercially available, and the rest (8) were switched to commercial medication: one to gentamycin (3mg/ml), 3 to cipro\ufb02oxacin (3mg/ml), 3 to moxi\ufb02oxacin (5mg/ml) and 1 to tobramycin (3mg/ml).\nOf the cases that did not meet criteria for severe keratitis \n(14), 10 (71%) were treated initially with topical cipro\ufb02oxa -\ncin hourly for 48 hours; this regime was maintained after the complete resolution of the in\ufb01ltrate, with good clinical evo -\nlution and no side effects in all cases. Two (14%) cases were treated initially with ceftazidime and tobramycin (both with good clinical evolution), and 2 (14%) with ceftazidime and vancomycin (one of them with suboptimal evolution).\nComparative results of antibiotic susceptibility are shown \nin the Table 2. In the MRSE group, there were signi\ufb01cant rates of resistance to cipro\ufb02oxacin (56%), tetracycline (50%), fu -\nsidic acid (45%) mupirocin (73%), and erythromycin (100%).

In MSSE group, treatment \nwith ceftazidime and tobramycin showed outcomes of 33% and 75% respectively in severe keratitis and 50% and 100% in non-severe, p>0,99\nDISCUSSION\nAccording to recommendations from the American Acad-\nemy of Ophthalmology, bacterial keratitis are commonly treat-ed with cipro\ufb02oxacin as empirical treatment [17]. However, MRSE is associated with in vitro resistance to this antibiotic, as well as to others commonly used in the ophthalmic clinical practice such as tobramycin [12,18].\nSome (75%) of the infections presented in this study re -\nsolved after antibiotic treatment with forti\ufb01ed topical antibi -\notics. The rest were treated with commercial cipro\ufb02oxacin, also with good clinical response including severe cases. We found no differences among the different treatment regimes in both groups. Therefore, the evolution of the infection not only de -\npends on treatment, but other aspects such as patient\u2019s risk factors or initial presentation of the lesion must also be taken into account.\nIn case of progression to endophthalmitis, oral linezolid \nmay be a valid choice, since it has shown excellent antibacte -linezolid, vancomycin, cipro\ufb02oxacin, tetracycline, fusidic acid, \nmupirocin and aminoglycosides. In vitro, the best results were obtained with linezolid, vancomycin, daptomycin, chloram-phenicol and rifampicin.\nTreatment outcomes in MSSE and MRSE groups. \nCases of severe and non-severe keratitis in MRSE and MSSE groups with good clinical response after empirical treatmentare showed in Table 3. At 48-hour follow-ups, 20 (74%) cases of MSSE keratitis presented with good clinical evolution, and 13 (81%) cases in the MRSE group (p= 0,719).\nOf those with suboptimal clinical response (10/43; 23%), \nthe initial treatment was: quinolones (1, 1%; in MSSE group); ceftazidime and tobramycin (3, 30%; 2 MRSE group and 1 MSSE group) and ceftazidime and vancomycin (6, 60%; 1 MRSE group and 5 MSSE group).\nOf all the 19 cases of keratitis treated initially with com -\nmercial cipro\ufb02oxacin, 18 (95%) cases showed a good clinical evolution after 48 hours. The only patient with suboptimal response was classi\ufb01ed as severe keratitis in the MSSE group (n=1; 5%).\nIn severe keratitis caused by MRSE, the ceftazidime and \nvancomycin regime showed an 80% ef\ufb01cacy (4 out of 5), and a 60% ef\ufb01cacy (3 out of 5) with ceftazidime and tobramycin MRSE\n(N=16)MSSE\n(N=27)\n% Resistance MIC 90 % Resistance MIC90 p\nCloxacillin 100 >2 0 \u22640.25 <0.001*\nCotrimoxazole 13 \u22642/38 7 \u22642/38 0.578\nErythromycin 100 >4 74 >4 0.026*\nClindamycin 75 0.5 33 0.5 0.063\nCiprofloxacin 56 >2 7 \u22641 <0.001*\nVancomycin 0 4 0 2\nLinezolid 0 4 0 2\nDaptomycin 0 \u22641 0 \u22641\nTetracycline 50 >8 11 2 0.005*\nRifampicin 0 \u22640.5 0 \u22640.5\nFusidico 45 >2 8 \u22642 0.013*\nMupirocin 73 >256 24 <256 0.02*\nChloramphenicol 0 \u22648 0 \u22648\nGentamicin 38 >8 18 4 0.168\nTobramycin 44 >8 30 8 0.348Table 2  Percentages of antibiotics resistance in MRSE and MSSE groups. \nMRSE: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis , MSSE: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis .\nMIC90 value was defined as the lowest concentration of the antibiotic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited.\n*P<0.05Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis infectious keratitis: Clinical and microbiological pro\ufb01le L.

Pre -\nvious studies highlight the colonization rate of Staphylococcus\nspecies on the ocular surface of healthy eyes, with S. epider-\nmidis being the most frequently isolated microorganism [11, 12, 20]. The patient\u2019s medical history and a careful slit lamp ophthalmologic evaluation are important to rule out possible false positives from microbiological analysis.\nThese multidrug resistant bacteria are not rare \ufb01ndings in \nthe clinical practice. In this study, a rate of 37.2% of MRSE is presented, which is similar to other publications [2,3]. Our study supports the hypothesis that the loss of ocular surface homeostasis can lead to corneal ulcers and stromal in\ufb01ltration, since the majority of cases were associated with risk factors. \nIn our experience, MRSE infections have shown to be clin -\nically similar to those caused by MSSE, as all the parameters analyzed showed no statistical signi\ufb01cance (follow-up time, presence of risk factors, size of the lesion, anterior chamber in\ufb02ammation or clinical response at 48h check-up). However, MRSE have shown to have higher in vitro resistances to com -\nmon antibiotics.\nRecent reports document multi-site infections with ex -\ntremely resistant S. epidermidis to antibiotics, including lin -\nezolid, vancomycin, and teicoplanin [21,22]. This represents a major health problem in the near future, not only related to ophthalmological conditions but also to systemic infections that could lead to the death of a patient.\nWe consider the relevance of the microbiological analysis \nin all keratitis, not only in severe cases, in order to establish the etiology and to adequately treat patients with speci\ufb01c medi-cation, so as not to contribute to increase antibiotic resistance in the future.\nThe main limitation of study is the small number of pa-\ntients included, although to our knowledge there are no long comparative series of S. epidermidis keratitis. Other limitations are its retrospective design and the inherent differences in clinical and therapeutic actions during patient management. In order to minimize the risk of overdiagnosis and attribute the \netiology to the local eye microbiota, samples from the healthy eye and the affected eye could have been analyzed in parallel, in order to con\ufb01rm the \ufb01ndings of the cultures.\nMRSE is a frequent cause of keratitis at our institution, \nespecially in patients with ocular risk factors (eyelid abnormal -\nities, previous keratopathy, traumatism or contact lens use). In our cohort, keratitis caused by MRSE and MSSE did not show differences in their clinical presentation, but MRSE showed multidrug resistance including resistance to \ufb02uoroquinolone and tetracycline antibiotics. \nFUNDING\nNone to declare\nCONFICTS OF INTEREST\nAll the authors state no con\ufb02icts of interest\nREFERENCES\n1.

Sepsis is the main cause of death in hospi -\ntals and the implementation of diagnosis and treatment bun -\ndles has shown to improve its evolution. However, there is a \nlack of evidence about patients attended in conventional units. \nMethods. A 3-year retrospective cohort study was con -\nducted. Patients hospitalized in Internal Medicine units with sepsis were included and assigned to two cohorts according to Sepsis Code (SC) activation (group A) or not (B). Baseline and evolution variables were collected.\nResults. A total of 653 patients were included. In 296 cas -\nes SC was activated. Mean age was 81.43 years, median Charl -\nson comorbidity index (CCI) was 2 and 63.25% showed some functional disability. More bundles were completed in group A: blood cultures 95.2% vs 72.5% ( p < 0.001), extended spectrum \nantibiotics 59.1% vs 41.4% ( p < 0.001), \ufb02uid resuscitation \n96.62% vs 80.95% ( p < 0.001). Infection control at 72 hours \nwas quite higher in group A (81.42% vs 55.18%, odds ratio 3.55 [2.48-5.09]). Antibiotic was optimized more frequently in group A (60.77% vs 47.03%, p 0.008). Mean in-hospital stay \nwas 10.63 days (11.44 vs 8.53 days, p < 0.001). Complications \nduring hospitalization appeared in 51.76% of patients, espe -\ncially in group B (45.95% vs 56.58%, odds ratio 1.53 [1.12-2.09]). Hospital readmissions were higher in group A (40% vs 24.76%, p < 0.001). 28-day mortality was signi\ufb01cantly lower in \ngroup A (20.95% vs 42.86%, odds ratio 0.33 [0.23-0.47]).\nConclusions. Implementation of SC seems to be effective \nin improving short-term outcomes in IM patients, although therapy should be tailored in an individual basis. \nKeywords: Sepsis, Internal Medicine, short-term mortality, complications, \nreadmissions\nCorrespondence: \nAzucena Bautista Hern\u00e1ndez Internal Medicine Clinician, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa.

The SC program included the main recom -\nmendations of the current SSC guidelines [9] regarding the di -\nagnosis, treatment and follow-up of sepsis. For that purpose, \nwe describe and analyze, in patients hospitalized at the IM ward, the baseline and evolutionary differences between pa -\ntients managed with and without activated SC. \nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nPatients. This was a retrospective study conducted at the \nIM unit of Hospital Universitario de La Princesa (HULP), a ter -\ntiary teaching center in Madrid (Spain), from January 2016 to December 2018.  The entire hospital has roughly 15000 ad -\nmissions per year and the IM Department around 2200. This study was approved by the Research ethics Committee of the hospital (protocol number: 3703).\nAll patients hospitalized at the IM ward as the \ufb01rst loca -\ntion and with a diagnosis, in the clinical discharge report, of sepsis or any septic-related presentation according to ICD-10-CM[23] were eligible. We checked if the SC alert had been ac-\ntivated in those patients hospitalized in MI during the study period. For this purpose, the documentation department has a list of all historically activated alerts in the hospital. The sample was divided into two cohorts according to wheth -\ner SC was activated (A) or not (B). The only exclusion criteri -\non was to have been initially admitted to other department.In addition, we included in cohort A those patients who lacked a sepsis or related diagnosis in the discharge report but were managed with an activated SC during hospitalization. The di-agnosis and treatment protocol in cohort A was based on the bundles recommended in the current SSC guidelines [9] and on usual care in cohort B. \nData collection. The following baseline demographic and \nclinical characteristics collected from the medical information system were included: age, gender, comorbidities, immuno -\nsuppression, risk factors for developing a multidrug-resistant bacterial (MDRB) or a fungal infection, presence and type of devices, functional capacity, site of infection, presence of third space enlargement de\ufb01ned as pleural effusion, leg edema or ascites, and evidence of some abscess. All of them referred to the situation at the time of hospital admission, which usually coincided with sepsis diagnosis. Comorbidity burden was as -\nsessed using the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). We con -\nsidered relevant comorbidity if CCI was >3 as previous reports [24\u201327]. Functional capacity was evaluated using the Barthel Index (BI) [28,29] and was classi\ufb01ed into three ranges: inde -\npendence \u2265 99 points, partial dependence 30-98 points and \nsevere dependence \u2264 29 points. \nThe type, number, and time of sampling for the micro -\nbiology laboratory were reviewed. Also, variables related to antibiotic treatment, surgical or interventionist control of the infectious site, \ufb02uid resuscitation, vasopressors, blood transfu -\nsions, and corticoid therapy were collected. Data on time to \ufb02uid resuscitation from diagnosis of sepsis and activation of SC were only available for patients in group A.mejorar los resultados a corto plazo en los pacientes de MI, \naunque el tratamiento debe adaptarse de forma individual.\nPalabras clave: Sepsis, Medicina Interna, mortalidad corto plazo, \ncomplicaciones, reingresos\nINTRODUCTION\nSepsis is the leading cause of death in hospitals in Spain \nand its incidence and mortality is constantly increasing in de -\nveloped countries [1\u20137]. The fatality rate associated with sepsis \nis higher than 10% and higher than other serious medical en -\ntities, reaching 40% in cases of septic shock [1,2].\nPrognosis of sepsis and septic shock is related to the time \nelapsed between the onset of symptoms and the administra -\ntion of antibiotics and \ufb02uid resuscitation [5,8]. In recent dec -\nades, various initiatives have shown that early and organized detection and treatment of sepsis, reduce mortality by up to 50% (3,4,9,10].  In our country, the Sepsis code protocol (SCP) has been endorsed by the main scienti\ufb01c societies [11,12]. In this context, a multidisciplinary team was formed in our hospi -\ntal in 2013. Its objective was to develop, promote and update a protocol to improve the prognosis of patients with sepsis, not only those admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), but al-so patients in conventional wards. Our guide established some key elements for sepsis management, focusing on diagnosis, biomarkers and therapy. It was based on the compendium of recommendations or bundles published by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign [9,13], among others. This SC initiative was imple -\nmented in the hospital\u00b4s clinical practice in 2015 \nMost of the evidence on the impact of these early detec -\ntion and management packages on sepsis patients comes from those hospitalized in the ICU [1\u20135]. This group of individuals usually share some characteristics such as age under 80 years, preserved functional capacity and absence of severe baseline comorbidity that could determine their survival prognosis.However, the clinical setting in conventional hospital units is different, especially in the case of Internal medicine (IM): the range of patients is broader including those with greater co -\nmorbidity, age or functional dependence [14,15]. Currently, there is limited evidence on how bundles affect the clinical course of these patients, who account for at least 50% of sep -\nsis diagnoses in hospitals [16,17]. Furthermore, despite proto-col implementation, we identify a signi\ufb01cant number of pa-tients in whom the code is not activated at the time of sepsis diagnosis. We think it could be related to a worse baseline sit-uation due to relevant comorbidities or cognitive impairment. In addition, literature has recently emerged offering contradic -\ntory \ufb01ndings about potential negative impact of implement -\ning certain aspects of the SCP such as excessive or rigid \ufb02uid resuscitation [18\u201322]. Therefore, we considered it necessary to develop a research line to explore the best management op-tions for this hugely diverse group of patients. \nAccordingly, the main aim of this study was to evaluate \nthe impact of the Sepsis Code (SC) on the morbidity and mor -\ntality of sepsis patients outside the ICU to identify potentially Impact of the implementation of a Sepsis Code Program in medical patient management: a cohort study in \nan Internal Medicine wardA.

A total of 653 patients out of \n6.676 admitted to the IM ward during the study period were \nincluded, as shown Figure 1. Of them, 564 patients were di-agnosed with sepsis or any related form in the medical dis -\ncharge report, while 89 patients did not have sepsis diagnosis but were managed with activated SC. The total of diagnosed patients was divided into two cohorts according to whether the SC was activated (cohort A, 296 patients) or not (cohort B, 357 patients). \nPatients in cohort B were older (83.05 vs 79.32 years , p\n=0.001) and their functional status was worse than those in cohort A (severe dependent patients 41.46% vs 27.36%, p < \n0.001). The presence of comorbidity and the distribution of in-fection foci did not differ between cohorts, whereas the pres-ence of third space enlargement was numerically greater in cohort B (p=0.056).\nCharacteristics of microbiological diagnosis and \ntreatment. The differences in timing and details of sample collection for microbiological diagnosis are summarized in Table 2. More samples were collected in cohort A (98.31% vs Outcome measures. The primary outcome was 28-day \nmortality rate. Other outcomes included were: 1) controlled \ninfection within 72 hours from diagnosis, de\ufb01ned as the ab -\nsence of fever, hemodynamic stability and improvement of acute phase reactants (drop in leukocytes, C-reactive protein or procalcitonin), 2) overall length of the stay, 3) in-hospital complications; 4) detrimental effects of antibiotic, 5) read -\nmission within the following 12 months and its causes, and 6) in-hospital and long-term mortality (at 365 days). \nStatistical analysis. Results are expressed as means and \nstandard deviation (SD), medians and interquartile range (IQR), or proportions with 95% con\ufb01dence intervals (CI) as appropri -\nate. \u03c72 test or Fisher\u00b4s exact test were used to compare cate -\ngorical variables and Student\u00b4s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test to compare continuous variables. The cumulative incidence of mortality was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. We examined factors as-sociated with outcomes by conducting logistic regression. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (ver -\nsion 25).

Conversely, at 365 days mortality reached 58.8% in cohort A vs 40.3% in B (OR 1.5 95% CI 1.00-2.25, p 0.045). Differences \nbetween 28-day survival curves are shown in Figure 6. High -\nlights the difference in mortality especially in the short term.  \nDISCUSSION\nBaseline characteristics and sepsis diagnosis.  Patients \nin our sample had an overall average age higher than that re -\nferred in the European series (around 70-75 years) [30\u201332]. The difference is even greater compared with cohort B. Our average age can be compared with that shown by Vardi et al. [33] and Liu et al. [34], from their elderly subgroup.\nRegarding comorbidities, the overall median CCI and the \npercentage of patients with immunosuppression, did not differ between cohorts and were similar to those of reference series [33,35]. It is notable that half of patients had risk factors for MDRB infection. More than half had a deteriorated functional status and a third showed severe deterioration. There are sig -\nni\ufb01cant differences between groups, with a worse functional status in no-SC group. We consider that this could be one of the criteria (along with age) for SC activation, since the rest of the baseline characteristics are similar in both groups. \nMost infections appeared at the pulmonary and urinary \ntracts in both cohorts and showed a low rate of abscesses, pre -\ufb02uid resuscitation (96.62% vs 80.95%,  p < 0.001) and vaso -\npressors (12.88% vs 1.4%, p < 0.001).  Time to \ufb02uid resuscita -\ntion in group A was less than 1 hour in 268 patients (93.71%). \nClinical evolution. Sepsis was controlled within 72 hours \nin 81.42% of patients in cohort A in contrast to 55.18% in cohort B (OR 3.55, 95% CI 2.48-5.09, p < 0.001) as shown in \nFigure 2. \nPatients with activated SC stayed longer in hospital (11.44 \ndays vs 8.53 days, p < 0.001) and received longer-lasting anti-\nbiotic treatments (12.46 days vs 8.26 days, p=0.003).  However, time to narrow the spectrum of antibiotics was longer in co -\nhort B (2.31 days vs 4.13 days, p=0.017). No differences in the time to hospital readmission could be found between the two cohorts (Table 3).  \nComplications during hospitalization are summarized in \nTable 4 and Figure 3. Remarkably, overall number of complica -\ntions was higher in cohort B (45.95% vs 56.58%, OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.09, p 0.007), as well as acute renal failure (0.7% vs 6.4%, OR 0.09 95% CI 0.02-0.42, p < 0.001) and others globally (10.1% vs 32.2%, OR 0.23 95% CI 0.15-0.36, p < 0.001).

Bautista Hern\u00e1ndez et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 178-191 184[22,39,40,47,48]. Therefore, it seems that antibiotic treatment \nis generally more appropriate in the SC group, although the time to narrow spectrum could be improved. In our study, group B developed more infections due to MDRB during the following year, and this could be related to suboptimal antibi -\notic de-escalation [49]. \nA higher number of patients were treated with \ufb02uid re -\nsuscitation and vasopressors in group A according to SCP recommendations. In both, the main choice were crystalloids and dopamine, respectively. We found no differences in blood transfusion or corticosteroid therapy between groups. \nClinical evolution. The probability of controlling infec-\ntion after 72 hours of treatment was almost 4 times higher in SC group. We found no published evidence regarding con -\ncrete information on early clinical improvement status after SCP implementation. Infection control is directly related to im -\nproving prognosis and short-term mortality [3,4,9,50]. In our population, complications were frequently observed, in more than 50% of patients, similar to that described by Vardi et al. [33]. The risk of complications is 1.5 higher in group B. Global length of stay was similar to other reports [4,37,42]. Treatment was more intensive in group A especially \ufb02uid resuscitation and it could be the reason for the higher incidence of heart failure. Acute confusional syndrome was also higher in group A. We think that it could be explained by longer reality dep -\nrivation. On the contrary, renal failure and others were more frequent in group B, probably related to this \u201cless invasive\u201d management. These \ufb01ndings widely support the opinion of other authors regarding the \ufb02exibility of the management rec -\nommendations in some frail patients, adapting them to their individual basis [18,19,21,22,51]. \nFinally, almost a third of survivors were readmitted within \n12 months. The probability of readmission is twice more fre -\nquent in group A. The mean time to readmission was similar in both groups. Half of them occurred in the \ufb01rst 3 months after discharge, which may suggest that they were related to com-plications of sepsis and its treatment. Readmission rates and causes within the \ufb01rst 90 days after discharge were similar to dictably in medical patients and similar to published evidence [35\u201337]. \nMicrobiological diagnosis and treatment . Microbio-\nlogical diagnosis efforts were signi\ufb01cantly different in both groups: samples were more frequently collected in group A, and the number of samples, speci\ufb01cally blood samples we -\nre also superior in this cohort while urine culture were more frequently obtained in group B, probably re\ufb02ecting the \u201cless invasive\u201d attitude in the second group. This \ufb01nding has im -\nportant implications for the correct antibiotic treatment and may affect the control and evolution of the infection [38\u201340]. The compliance with the diagnostic sepsis bundles in cohort A are considerably better than those described in previous series (20-50%). [3,36,41,42]. \nAntibiotic and \ufb02uid therapy were administered in a similar \nproportion than described in previous studies in ICU patients (63-100%), whereas the proportion of vasopressor or steroid administration was lower [27-100% and 29.9-70%, respec -\ntively) [3,4,41] as expected in conventional wards.\nExtended spectrum antibiotics (ESA) were more frequently \nadministered in cohort A. We found that these patients had more risk factors for MDRB at admission. Although combined therapy was more common in group B maybe re\ufb02ecting the need for achieving the same coverage with narrower spectrum drugs. Antibiotic therapy was adjusted to microbiological re -\nsults in more cases in group A and time to reduce antibiotic spectrum coverage was shorter. Moreover, antibiotic treat -\nment was switched to oral route more frequently, though not earlier. Nevertheless, we observed a higher mean duration of total antibiotic treatment in group A. Similar length in the context of SCP implementation is shown in other series in our country (a mean of 10.9 days in Pinilla et al. [43] and 13 days in Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez et al. [44]). Furthermore, it has been suggest -\ned that antibiotic stewardship programs do not reduce total duration of therapy [40,45,46] and there is an increasing ev -\nidence showing that an early antibiotic de-escalation based on microbiological results provides similar survival and out-comes to those of a longer and extended treatment regimen Quantitative variables Total SC activated (A) SC not activated (B) p\nLength of hospital stay in days, mean (SD) 8.51 (10.63) 12.63 (11.44) 5.10 (8.53) < 0.001\nLength of ICU stay in days, mean (SD) 8.5 (6.86) 6.2 (4.32) 10.14 (8.15) 0.350\nTotal duration of antibiotic treatment in days, mean (SD) 11.55 (10.36) 12.77 (12.46) 10.29 (8.26) 0.003\nTime to reduce antibiotic spectrum coverage in days, mean (SD) 4.35 (3.21) 3.88 (2.31) 5.04 (4.13) 0.017\nTime to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic in days, mean (SD) 6.46 (5.21) 6.88 (5.54) 5.93 (4.75) 0.117\nTime to hospital readmission in days, mean (SD) 105.98 (97.89) 103.46 (97.77) 107.85 (98.53) 0.741\nTime to hospital readmission in days, median (IQR) 64.88 (30.41-152.08) 64.88 (32.44-151.06) 64.38 (30.41-154.87) 0.903Table 3  Quantitative variables. \nSignificant p values (\u2264 0.05) are highlighted in bold.

This \ufb01nding is likely to be related to the baseline charac -\nteristics of our population: higher mean age and a worse func -\ntional status than described series. Furthermore, these base-line conditions are the leading cause of long-term mortality related to sepsis [15,30,32,33,35], regardless of the treatment implemented. Remarkably, long-term mortality was higher in cohort A \nthan in cohort B. This can be explained by the fact that the baseline characteristics are similar in both cohorts, and the implementation of SC bundles is not enough to combat the severity of morbidity due to sepsis. Female sex, aging, comor -\nbidities, immunosuppression, severity of sepsis and respira-tory infections, has been described as independent factors of long-term mortality in several studies [57\u201359], but these did Impact of the implementation of a Sepsis Code Program in medical patient management: a cohort study in \nan Internal Medicine wardA.

The study has some \nlimitations. It was a retrospective study and the quality of the results therefore depends on correct documentation. No veri\ufb01 -\ncation of the sepsis diagnostic criteria was performed in group B. Patients were selected in the basis of their discharge diag -\nnosis, and so we may have lost patients in which such term was not properly recorded (codi\ufb01cation bias). We did not ana -\nlyze profoundly readmissions data and so relevant information about evolution could have been lost. \nOur study has also several strengths. It includes a large \ncohort of patients from IM unit and compares two concurrent cohorts considering SC activation.\nConclusions. Patients admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis \nin IM wards are elderly, with high comorbidity and functional disabilities. This fragility baseline situation is even greater in those patients managed without activating the SC.  \nMore extensive microbiological diagnosis, more intensive \ntreatment and adaptation of antibiotic therapy was performed in SC group. Nevertheless, a longer antibiotic treatment is also administered. This group has better infection control rate at 72 hours, less complications and lower short-term mortality. On the contrary, in-hospital stay, heart failure episode and read -\nmissions increase in patients managed with this protocol.\nImplementation of a SCP seems to be effective in improv -\ning short-term outcomes of patients admitted in IM units, al -\nthough therapy should be tailored in an individual basis. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to acknowledge the contribution of all \nmembers of \u201cSepsis Code Princesa\u201d to the development of the hospital\u00b4s programme and its legacy in improving the quality of life of patients.\nFUNDING\nNone to declare\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare no con\ufb02icts of interest.\nREFERENCES\n1 Angus DC, Linde-Zwirble WT, Lidicker J, Clermont G, Carcillo J, Pin-\nsky MR.

To describe the approach to the patients with \nsuspected sepsis in the Spanish emergency department hos -\npitals (ED) and analyze whether there are differences accord -\ning to the size of the hospital and the number of visits to the \nemergency room.\nMethod. Structured survey of those responsible for the \n282 public EDs that serve adults 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It was asked about assistance and management in the emergency room in the care of patients with suspected sepsis. The results are compared according to hospital size (large \u2265\n500 beds vs medium-small <500) and in\ufb02ux to the emergency room (discharge \u2265 200 visits / day vs medium-low <200).\nResults. A total of 250 Spanish EDs responded (89%). \nSepsis protocols are available in 163 (65%) EDs median week -\nly sepsis treated ranged from 0-5 per week in 39 (71%) ED, 6-10 per week in 10 (18%), 11-15 per week in 4 (7%), and more than 15 activations per week in 3 centers (3.6%). The criteria used for sepsis diagnosis were the qSOFA/SOFA in 105 (63.6%) of the hospitals, SIRS in 6 (3.6%), while in 49 (29.7%) they used both criteria simultaneously. In 79 centers, the sep -\nsis diagnosis was computerized, and in 56 there were tools to help decision-making. 48% (79 of 163) of the EDs had data on bundles compliance. In 61% (99 of 163) of EDs there was training in sepsis and in 56% (55 of 99) it was periodic.

Encuesta estructurada a los responsables de los \n282 SUH p\u00fablicos que atienden adultos 24 horas/d\u00eda, 365 d\u00edas/a\u00f1o. Se pregunt\u00f3 sobre asistencia y manejo en urgencias en la atenci\u00f3n a pacientes con sospecha de sepsis. Los resultados se comparan seg\u00fan tama\u00f1o del hospital (grande \u2265 500 camas vs \nmedio-peque\u00f1o < 500) y a\ufb02uencia en urgencias (alta \u2265 200 \nvisitas/d\u00eda vs media-baja < 200). \nResultados. Respondieron 250 SUH espa\u00f1oles (89%). En \n163 (65%) SUH se dispone de protocolos de sepsis. La mediana de sepsis semanales atendidas variaban desde 0-5 por sema -\nna en 39 (71%) SUH, 6-10 por semana en 10 (18%), 11-15 por semana en 4 (7%), y m\u00e1s de 15 activaciones por semana en 3 centros (3,6%). Los criterios utilizados para la activaci\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo sepsis (CS) fueron el qSOFA/SOFA en 105 (63,6%) de los hospitales, SIRS en 6 (3,6%), mientras que en 49 (29,7%) utilizaban ambos criterios de forma simultanea. En 79 centros el CS estaba informatizado y en 56 exist\u00edan herramientas de ayuda a la toma de decisiones. Un 48% (79 de 163) de los SUH dispon\u00edan de datos de cumplimiento de medidas.

La encuesta se dise\u00f1\u00f3 entre septiembre y octubre de 2020, y para evitar el efecto de la pandemia CO -\nVID-19 en la actividad asistencial, se solicitaron los datos del a\u00f1o 2019 [9,10].\nEl universo a estudio fue todos los SUH del sistema p\u00fabli -\nco de salud espa\u00f1ol que atienden urgencias generales de pa-cientes adultos, 24 horas al d\u00eda, 7 d\u00edas a la semana y los 365 d\u00edas (24/7/365) en el a\u00f1o 2019. El estudio se dise\u00f1\u00f3 en base a una intenci\u00f3n de inclusi\u00f3n total, con el objetivo de obtener un mapa de la atenci\u00f3n a la sepsis en los SUH de nuestro pa\u00eds. La fuente de centros la constituy\u00f3 el Cat\u00e1logo Nacional de Hos -\npitales de 2019 [11] con 924 centros. Se excluyeron 642 (323 por no ser generales, 315 privados sin concierto, 2 militares y 2 cerrados el 2019), por lo que el universo a encuestar fue de 282 SUH. \nLa encuesta se remiti\u00f3 al responsable del SUH, con quien \npreviamente se hab\u00eda contactado por tel\u00e9fono para explicarle el proyecto y solicitar su colaboraci\u00f3n. Se envi\u00f3 telem\u00e1tica -\nmente un enlace a la encuesta en l\u00ednea para poder completarla y tambi\u00e9n en formato pdf por correo electr\u00f3nico por si pre -\nfer\u00eda escanearla y enviar las respuestas por e-mail. Si despu\u00e9s de 3 contactos no se recib\u00eda respuesta se consideraba ese SUH como no respondedor. Las entrevistas se realizaron durante di -\nciembre de 2020 y enero y febrero de 2021. \nAn\u00e1lisis estad\u00edstico. Los datos continuos se presentan \ncomo mediana y rango intercuartil (RIC), y los discretos como valores absolutos y porcentajes. Los centros se agruparon en funci\u00f3n del n\u00famero de camas (grandes \u2265 500; medios/peque-\u00f1os < 500) y de la a\ufb02uencia de pacientes (alta \u2265 200/d\u00eda; me-\ndia/baja < 200) siguiendo la de\ufb01nici\u00f3n de trabajos previos [12]. La comparaci\u00f3n entre los grupos se realiz\u00f3 mediante el test no param\u00e9trico de Mann-Whitney si las variables eran continuas y mediante el test de ji cuadrado si las variables eran discretas. Un valor de p < 0,05 se consider\u00f3 estad\u00edsticamente signi\ufb01ca -\ntivo.\nConsideraciones \u00e9ticas.

Most EDs have sepsis protocols, but there is \nroom for improvement. The computerization and development of alerts for diagnosis and treatment still have a long way to go in EDs.\nKey words: Sepsis, sepsis code, emergency departments\nINTRODUCCI\u00d3N\nLa incidencia de la infecci\u00f3n en los servicios de urgencias \nhospitalarios (SUH) supon\u00eda el 14,3% de las visitas diarias hace una d\u00e9cada [1], aunque se estima que esta ha podido aumen -\ntar en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os [2]. Por otra parte, la incidencia y la prevalencia de la sepsis no resulta tan clara de conocer, ya que ambas var\u00edan en funci\u00f3n de las de\ufb01niciones utilizadas, las cua -\nles han ido cambiando en el devenir de los a\u00f1os. Esto da lugar a que puede registrarse una incidencia del 6,2% del total de las infecciones diagnosticadas, si se utilizan los criterios cl\u00e1sicos de sospecha de infecci\u00f3n y s\u00edndrome de respuesta in\ufb02amatoria sist\u00e9mica (SIRS) [1], o del 30% si se tienen en cuenta otras de -\n\ufb01niciones o criterios [3,4].\nSe sabe que la sepsis es una de las enfermedades deno -\nminadas tiempo-dependientes, en las cuales es de suma im -\nportancia su detecci\u00f3n precoz para poder establecer el trata -\nmiento lo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido posible, ya que la demora en su inicio y mantenimiento se asocia a un aumento de la morbilidad y mortalidad en los pacientes que la sufren [5]. Desde la publi -\ncaci\u00f3n de las \u00faltimas de\ufb01niciones de la sepsis en el a\u00f1o 2016 [6,7] se han establecido m\u00e9todos diagn\u00f3sticos de cara a iden -\nti\ufb01car precozmente al paciente s\u00e9ptico basados en el uso de diferentes escalas de gravedad como el Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), el National Early Warning Score (NEWS) o el Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) y la determinaci\u00f3n de biomarcadores como el \u00e1cido l\u00e1ctico, la pro -\nte\u00edna C reactiva (PCR) o la procalcitonina (PCT). A\u00fan hoy sigue abierto el debate cient\u00ed\ufb01co sobre cu\u00e1les son los mejores crite -\nrios para identi\ufb01car el paciente con sepsis en los servicios de urgencias [8].\nEn esta l\u00ednea, ya hace unos a\u00f1os se cre\u00f3 el concepto de \nc\u00f3digo sepsis (CS), cuyo objetivo \u00faltimo es facilitar la detecci\u00f3n de los enfermos con sospecha de sepsis en cualquier nivel asis -\ntencial, e intentar estandarizar el cumplimiento de toda una serie de medidas terap\u00e9uticas desde el minuto cero y durante las primeras horas tras su detecci\u00f3n, y todo ello con equipos multidisciplinares, con la implicaci\u00f3n de diferentes especialida-des m\u00e9dicas, quir\u00fargicas y de enfermer\u00eda. \nA pesar de todo esto la sepsis sigue teniendo cifras in-\naceptables de mortalidad llegando en el caso del shock s\u00e9ptico al 15-50% [3], siendo a\u00fan una patolog\u00eda infradiagnosticada en todos los \u00e1mbitos sanitarios. En los SUH se cree que pueden pasar inadvertidos casi el 50% de los pacientes s\u00e9pticos [4]. \nA\u00fan hoy, se desconoce el grado de implantaci\u00f3n del CS \nen el \u00e1mbito hospitalario de nuestro pa\u00eds, as\u00ed como la dispo -Mapa de la situaci\u00f3n actual de la atenci\u00f3n a la sepsis en los servicios de urgencias espa\u00f1oles F.

Se ha descrito alguna esti -\nmaci\u00f3n que \ufb01jaba la implantaci\u00f3n del CS entre los SUH espa-\u00f1oles en alrededor del 30-50% [4]. Sin embargo, de nuestro tigaci\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica. Se garantiz\u00f3 la con\ufb01dencialidad de los datos \nindividuales y se solicit\u00f3 su aprobaci\u00f3n verbal para participar voluntariamente en el estudio.\nRESULTADOS\nDe los 282 responsables de los SUH contactados respon -\ndieron 250 (89%), con una tasa de respuesta superior al 80% en las Ciudades Aut\u00f3nomas de Ceuta, Melilla y en 14 de las 17 Comunidades Aut\u00f3nomas (Tabla 1). De los 250 SUH, 59 (24%) correspond\u00edan a hospitales grandes y 114 (46%) reportaban una actividad asistencial alta, con una poblaci\u00f3n total asigna-da de 19,5 millones los hospitales grandes (mediana: 0,35, RIC: 0,30-0,46) y 26,2 millones los hospitales medianos/peque\u00f1os (mediana: 0,13, RIC: 0,06-0,19). En el a\u00f1o 2019 los 250 SUH analizados realizaron 19,4 millones de asistencias (mediana: 0,07, RIC: 0,03-0,11).\nEl 46% de los SUH dispon\u00edan de servicio o unidad de in -\nfecciosas de hospitalizaci\u00f3n y el 33% y el 5% contaban, res -\npectivamente, con microbi\u00f3logo e infect\u00f3logo de guardia 24/7/365. Solamente 21 SUH (8%) respondieron disponer de unidad de sepsis. Sin embargo, 99 de 249 (40%) eran recepto -\nres de enfermos con CS, 163 (65%) dispon\u00edan de protocolos de sepsis urgente y 114 (46%) de hospitalizaci\u00f3n. La mediana de sepsis semanales atendidas en estos SUH fue muy variable, 55 de 165 (33%) SUH respondieron conocer el n\u00famero de activa -\nciones semanales, que variaban desde 0-5 por semana en 39 (71%) SUH, 6-10 por semana en 10 (18%), 11-15 por semana en 4 (7%), a hasta m\u00e1s de 15 activaciones por semana en 3 centros (3,6%). Al preguntar por las falsas activaciones, 31 de estos 55 (56%) SUH respondieron no tener ninguna, 15 (27%) un porcentaje de falsas activaciones inferior al 10% y 9 (16%) de m\u00e1s del 11%, estos \u00faltimos correspond\u00edan mayoritariamen -\nte a los centros que m\u00e1s CS activaban. \nEn la mayor\u00eda de los casos (58%) el CS lo pod\u00eda activar \nmedicina o enfermer\u00eda. Los criterios utilizados para la activa-ci\u00f3n del CS fueron el qSOFA/SOFA en 105 (64%) de los hospi -\ntales, SIRS en 6 (3,6%), mientras que en 49 (30%) utilizaban ambos criterios de forma simultanea. Cinco (3%) centros ma -\nnifestaron seguir criterios propios. En 79 centros el CS esta -\nba informatizado y en 56 existen herramientas de ayuda a la toma de decisiones como calculadoras de escalas, sistemas de alerta o gu\u00edas para el uso de antimicrobianos.\nUn 48% (79 de 163) de los SUH dispon\u00edan de datos de cum -\nplimiento de medidas: toma de lactato en el 97%, hemocultivos y \ufb02uidoterapia en el 99% y antibioterapia precoz en el 100%. En 159 de 163 (98%) de los hospitales se utilizaban biomarcadores, siendo el lactato y la PCR los que se usaban mayoritariamente de forma rutinaria. En el 61% (99 de 163) de SUH exist\u00eda for -\nmaci\u00f3n en sepsis y en el 56% (55 de 99) \u00e9sta era peri\u00f3dica.

Tal vez el hecho de que el CS sea un proceso con una gran heterogeneidad y la falta a\u00fan de una prueba diagn\u00f3stica est\u00e1ndar [22], unido a que no exista una t\u00e9cnica terap\u00e9utica tan efectiva como la reperfusi\u00f3n del tejido cardiaco o cerebral que desarrollan es-pecialidades muy espec\u00ed\ufb01cas, haya generado un retraso en su desarrollo global. En todo caso, pensamos que desde los ser-vicios de urgencias, al ser el primer eslab\u00f3n en la cadena asis -\ntencial de estos pacientes, se tendr\u00eda que impulsar medidas para el avance global del CS y liderar desde nuestro \u00e1mbito sanitario estas iniciativas [4]. No obstante, dado el car\u00e1cter transversal de esta patolog\u00eda es fundamental e imprescindi -trabajo se desprende que la implantaci\u00f3n de este c\u00f3digo su-\npera ampliamente el 50% de los SUH de hospitales analizados, situ\u00e1ndose con los datos proporcionados por sus responsables en el 65%, lo que con\ufb01rma la preocupaci\u00f3n por este problema entre los m\u00e9dicos de urgencias de nuestro pa\u00eds, si bien hay di -\nferencias entre las diferentes Comunidades Aut\u00f3nomas.

Sin em-bargo, creemos que algunas de las implementaciones pueden resultar lo su\ufb01cientemente simples como para que sean adop -\ntadas en cualquier SUH, independientemente del tama\u00f1o del centro o de su a\ufb02uencia en Urgencias. M\u00e1s a\u00fan teniendo en cuenta que los hospitales de tama\u00f1o m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o dan soporte a m\u00e1s de la mitad de la poblaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola, por lo que no de-ber\u00edan ser excluidos de cualquier actuaci\u00f3n frente una enfer -\nmedad tiempo-dependiente como la sepsis. \nPor otra parte, con la disponibilidad de las nuevas tecno -\nlog\u00edas, creemos que la informatizaci\u00f3n del CS resulta de es -\npecial inter\u00e9s. Sin embargo, solo el 47% de SUH respondieron disponer de un CS informatizado. En este sentido, disponer de herramientas de ayuda en la decisi\u00f3n como las calculadoras de escalas, sistemas de alerta o de antibioterapia han demos -\ntrado resultados muy favorables. En un estudio de Ferreras et al. en Arag\u00f3n [23], la implementaci\u00f3n de un sistema de alar -\nmas autom\u00e1tico para la detecci\u00f3n precoz de los pacientes con sepsis grave obtuvo una reducci\u00f3n de mortalidad en t\u00e9rminos absolutos del 11,3% al ingreso y una mayor supervivencia a los 30 d\u00edas de forma signi\ufb01cativa, siendo el NNT de 8. Los autores concluyeron que la ausencia de sistemas de detecci\u00f3n auto -\nm\u00e1tica en urgencias implicaba un riesgo 2,02 veces mayor de muerte a los 30 d\u00edas que si se dispon\u00eda de este sistema. \nDe forma paralela a esta baja informatizaci\u00f3n de los siste-\nmas, se observa el peque\u00f1o n\u00famero de hospitales que recogen los datos de cumplimiento de las medidas b\u00e1sicas iniciales ante \nla sospecha de un paciente con sepsis, lo que impide en gran medida tener una monitorizaci\u00f3n de las actuaciones que se es -\nt\u00e1n llevando a cabo, algo b\u00e1sico para detectar \u00e1reas de mejora y reconocer aquellas que se muestren realmente e\ufb01caces en el manejo de los pacientes [14,15,20].\nUno de los puntos clave en la actuaci\u00f3n en los pacientes \ncon sepsis es el reconocimiento precoz en los servicios de ur-gencias y emergencias. En esta l\u00ednea, en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se han propuesto diferentes escalas para su identi\ufb01caci\u00f3n. Ac -\ntualmente la gran mayor\u00eda de los hospitales que tienen un CS en el SUH detectan los pacientes s\u00e9pticos mediante las escalas SOFA o qSOFA, que podr\u00edamos catalogarlos como los est\u00e1nda-res actuales para la valoraci\u00f3n del deterioro de la funci\u00f3n de \u00f3rganos entre los pacientes con sospecha de infecci\u00f3n. El uso de estas escalas ha aumentado de forma muy importante, ya que su uso exclusivo ha pasado de un 25% a un 63%, mientras que el uso combinado de estas dos escalas junto con el SIRS ha bajado del 50% al 30% en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os [4]. Parece claro que, a pesar de las limitaciones de estas escalas en t\u00e9rminos de sensibilidad y especi\ufb01cidad para la valoraci\u00f3n del paciente s\u00e9ptico en los SUH [24,25], su implantaci\u00f3n actual en los SUH espa\u00f1oles es indudable. \nOtro punto cr\u00edtico es el uso de los biomarcadores que se \nrecomiendan para la valoraci\u00f3n inicial de los pacientes s\u00e9p -\nticos. Es llamativo que el \u00e1cido l\u00e1ctico no est\u00e9 disponible en el 100% de los hospitales consultados y no se use de forma rutinaria en el 13,2% de los SUH. En nuestra opini\u00f3n, se debe promover y favorecer el uso del \u00e1cido l\u00e1ctico, que juega un papel fundamental en la valoraci\u00f3n pron\u00f3stica de los pacien -\ntes s\u00e9pticos.

(cont.)\ndiagn\u00f3sticos imprescindibles para diagnosticar a un paciente \nde shock s\u00e9ptico [7]. Otro biomarcador de infecci\u00f3n que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido gran protagonismo en la valoraci\u00f3n diagn\u00f3stica de infecci\u00f3n bacteriana es la PCT [28]. Este biomar-cador respalda el diagn\u00f3stico de sepsis [14] y tiene un mejor rendimiento que la PCR [29]. Los resultados muestran que se utiliza en menor medida al no estar disponible en uno de cada 10 hospitales, lo que entendemos que es un punto de mejora \na abordar. \nOtro de los aspectos analizados es la presencia de microbi\u00f3 -\nlogo de guardia, lo que s\u00f3lo se produce en un tercio de los hos -\npitales. Esta falta de servicio de microbiolog\u00eda las 24 horas o los festivos hace que no sea posible implantar t\u00e9cnicas espec\u00ed\ufb01cas de diagn\u00f3stico r\u00e1pido o bien la identi\ufb01caci\u00f3n de hemocultivos Figura 1  Porcentaje de hospitales dentro de cada Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma en la que \nse han asumido los criterios diagn\u00f3sticos basados en el qSOFA/SOFA.\nMapa de la situaci\u00f3n actual de la atenci\u00f3n a la sepsis en los servicios de urgencias espa\u00f1oles F.

Esto podr\u00eda provo -\ncar que, aunque la solicitud de hemocultivos se realice de forma \ncorrecta, s\u00f3lo se pueda obtener un adecuado rendimiento en horario de ma\u00f1ana en d\u00edas laborables y no de forma continuada [4]. Esto se acent\u00faa a\u00fan m\u00e1s en los hospitales peque\u00f1os. \nPor \u00faltimo, algo que se observa en la mayor\u00eda de los hos-\npitales es que el CS puede ser activado tanto por los profesio -\nnales de medicina como de enfermer\u00eda, pero a\u00fan hay muchos hospitales en que la enfermer\u00eda no puede generar esta acti -\nvaci\u00f3n. Esto posiblemente necesite ser evaluado y revisado ya que en la mayor parte de los hospitales los profesionales de enfermer\u00eda son los que realizan el triaje inicial de los pacientes que acuden a Urgencias y es precisamente en esa parte de la valoraci\u00f3n inicial del paciente cuando es fundamental el reco-nocimiento y activaci\u00f3n de estos c\u00f3digos de patolog\u00edas tiem -\npo-dependientes como la sepsis [30].\nNuestro estudio presenta algunas limitaciones: 1) Los re -\nsultados se basan en la opini\u00f3n del responsable del SUH y no de sus profesionales, cuya opini\u00f3n no siempre resulta coinci -\ndente [31]; 2) Algunos aspectos encuestados no fueron va -\nlorados de forma cuantitativa sino cualitativamente, lo que pudiera comportar que las categor\u00edas cualitativas no fuesen equidistantes; 3) El reclutamiento no fue completo, pero la participaci\u00f3n pr\u00f3xima al 90% conlleva que los resultados obte-nidos sean \ufb01ables y representativos de la asistencia a la sepsis en los SUH espa\u00f1oles. A pesar de estas limitaciones, el presente estudio ofrece una fotograf\u00eda de la realidad asistencial que los SUH proporcionan a los pacientes con sospecha de sepsis y con la informaci\u00f3n obtenida detectar aquellos aspectos en los que podemos incidir para mejorar el diagn\u00f3stico y manejo precoz \nde la sepsis, con el consiguiente bene\ufb01cio para los enfermos.\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, pensamos que aunque se est\u00e1 avanzando \nen el desarrollo de protocolos espec\u00ed\ufb01cos para el tratamiento de la sepsis en los SUH, existe margen de mejora, sobre todo en los hospitales de menor tama\u00f1o. Creemos que la informatiza -\nci\u00f3n y el desarrollo de alertas para el diagn\u00f3stico y tratamiento tienen a\u00fan un gran recorrido en los SUH. A\u00fan existiendo un protocolo nacional para el desarrollo del CS [13], opinamos que cada sistema sanitario tendr\u00eda que incidir en promover y crear protocolos propios basados en recomendaciones univer -\nsales aplicando al mismo las peculiaridades de cada sistema. \nAGRADECIMIENTOS\nA Alicia D\u00edaz, por su labor de identi\ufb01caci\u00f3n y contacto con \nlos responsables de todos los servicios de urgencias hospitala -\nrios espa\u00f1oles.\nFINANCIACI\u00d3N\nTrabajo \ufb01nanciado por una ayuda no condicionada de La -\nboratorios Gilead.\nBIBLIOGRAF\u00cdA\n1.

The aim of this work was to scan the SARS-CoV-2 genome in search for therapeutic targets. We found a sequence in the 5\u2019UTR (NC\\_045512:74-130), con -\nsisting of a typical heptamer next to a structured region that may cause ribosomal frameshifting. The potential biological value of this region is relevant through its low similarity with other viruses, including coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV, and its high sequence conservation within multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We have predicted the secondary structure of the region by means of different bioinformatic tools. We have suggested a most probable secondary structure to proceed with a 3D reconstruction of the structured segment. Finally, we carried out virtual docking on the 3D structure to look for a binding site and then for drug ligands from a database of lead compounds. Several molecules that could be probably administered as oral drugs show promising binding af\ufb01nity within the structured region, and so it could be possible in -\nterfere its potential regulatory role.\nKeywords: SARS-CoV-2; frameshifting; 5\u2019UTR; pseudoknot; molecular \ndocking.\nCorrespondence: \nEmilio Garcia-MoranCentro Nacional de la Gripe.

Garcia-Moran, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 204-212 205is highly conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as \nthere is only one single nucleotide difference, a C to A substi -\ntution at position 13,533 bp.\nThe frameshifting regions could be used as a target to \n\ufb01ght viral infection [9]. Starting with early studies, point mu -\ntations at the slippery sequence have proved to have an im -\nportant effect on viral replication [8]; thus, they can be also interesting points in the engineering of an attenuated virus for vaccine development. The inhibition of these regions by pep -\ntide antisense oligomers was studied by Neuman et al. [10]. Af -\nter several passages in cell culture, virions escape the inhibition of replication but show attenuated forms. Rangan et al. [11], described highly structured areas of RNA that might be less accessible to complementary oligomers, but these convoluted areas would provide small binding sites for conventional drug molecules; therefore, a combination of scanning for structure and sequence conservation may be appropriate to \ufb01nd thera -\npeutic targets. Previous studies using in silico methods found \ndrug-like molecules that would inhibit SARS-CoV replication by action on the frameshifting region at the overlap between ORF1a and ORF1b [12]. The same molecule has been shown to affect replication in SARS-CoV-2 [9].\nIn this work, we scanned the SARS-CoV-2 genome to seek \nfor novel likely critical areas for virus replication focusing on frameshifting predictors. We explored the likely biological rele-vance of this feature through the study of sequence conserva -\ntion and its suitability as a potential drug target by the analysis of the structural properties and the drug docking prediction.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \nGenomewide frameshifting signal search.  A prediction \nof the relevant sequence and structures in the viral reference genome for SARS-CoV-2 (NC 045512) [13] was performed us -\ning the KnotInFrame tool [14]. The output determined the se -\nquence and position of slippery sequences and nearby pseudo -\nknots, since both criteria are needed to predict frameshifting. Our focus on a particular region was established by combining KnotInFrame output with biological knowledge. We focused on previously undescribed frameshifting regions and the likely regulatory roles of UTR regions. Once a sequence of interest met these criteria, an inspection of the predicted secondary structure was achieved with additional tools ipknot [15] and RNAfold from Vienna Suite [16]. The secondary structure for the segment of interest in dot bracket notation was chosen from the inspection of the overall conformation of the 5\u2019UTR and assuring to include the slippery region. The likelihood of the secondary structure was assessed by computing the mini -\nmum free energy (MFE) of a large number of random sequenc-es of SARS-CoV-2 of the same length as the sequence of in -\nterest into mFold, in order to obtain an empirical distribution of MFE and so assess how dominant the proposed structure would be [17].\nConservation of the sequence of interest. Sequence \nconservation was assessed for the sequence of interest deter -ple are vaccinated. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae\nfamily and is related to SARS-CoV and Middle East Respirato -\nry Syndrome (MERS)-CoV (79% and 50% genomic similarity, \nrespectively). SARS-CoV caused an epidemic outbreak in 2003 and MERS caused an outbreak in 2012 [1]. Those three viruses belong to the Betacoronavirus genus. Coronaviruses cause zo-\nonotic infections, so they may spill over from a host species to a different one through small changes in their genome. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated a high genetic similarity (more than 85%) to a virus group known as SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), which are isolated from animal hosts, including Hipposi-deros bats and pangolins ( Manis javanica). These species seem \nto be candidates as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 [2,3]. \nThese viruses have a positively translated single strand RNA \ngenome and they use programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift-ing (\u22121 PRF) to direct the synthesis of immediate early pro -\nteins that prepare the infected cell for takeover by the virus. Frameshifting is a smart mechanism for the translation of a genomic sequence into two different proteins by moving the translation frame one position in the union between RNA and the ribosome [4]. A typical frameshifting signal has two essen -\ntial elements: a characteristic heptanucleotide called the \u2018slip -\npery\u2019 sequence, at which the ribosome-bound tRNAs slip into the -1 frame, and an adjacent mRNA secondary structure that stimulates this slippage process. The intermediate sequence be-tween these two elements also has a typical size of less than twelve nucleotides. Often the secondary structure is more complex than a simple stem-loop between palindromic se -\nquences, expanding into pseudoknots [5]. In terms of structure, a pseudoknot forms upon the base-pairing of a single-stranded region of RNA in the loop of a hairpin to a stretch of comple -\nmentary nucleotides elsewhere in the RNA chain. \nA set of bioinformatic tools has already been developed to \npredict these structures [6]. The mechanism of action of pseu -\ndoknots is not completely understood; some authors suggest that it appears to be linked to the helicase activity of the ribo -\nsome. When pseudoknots are located in coding regions, they modulate the elongation and termination steps of translation: the ribosome is able to switch from the zero reading frame to the \u22121 frame and translation continues in the new frame. When pseudoknots are in non-coding regions, they act on the regulation of the initiation of protein synthesis and on tem -\nplate recognition by the viral replicase guiding viral replication and packaging [7].\nAll coronaviruses have been reported to utilize pro -\ngrammed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting to control the expression of their proteins. In 2005, Plant et al. [8] identi\ufb01ed a three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot inducing an ef\ufb01cient -1 ribosomal frameshift in the SARS-CoV genome. By this mechanism, the virus may produce a fusion protein that overlaps the regions ORF1a and ORF1b. This element encodes an ORF1ab polypro -\ntein involved in ablating the host cellular innate immune re -\nsponse. Mutations affecting this structure decreased the rates of -1 PRF and had deleterious effects on the virus propaga -\ntion. Recently, Kelly et al. [9] described the same pseudoknot in SARS-CoV-2, and they demonstrated frameshifting. This area Putative Secondary Structure at 5\u2019UTR as a Potential Antiviral Target against SARS-CoV-2 E. Garcia-Moran, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 204-212 206Prediction of 3D structure and molecular docking.\nUpon consideration of different alternatives, the structure of \nthe sequence of interest in dot-bracket notation and the un -\nderlying nucleotide sequence were imported into Rnacomposer [24] to obtain a 3D structure prediction in .pdb format. The \ufb01le in .pdb format was used as input for the virtual scan for active sites. This task was carried out using Autodock tools suite [25]. This suite comprises the AutoGrid and Autoligand tools for the search of active sites in a molecular 3D structure. A combina -\ntion of manual selection of the region of interest and automat -\nic search space by the tools was used to obtain the coordinates and dimensions of a putative active site. These data were used as inputs for the molecular docking by the Autodock Vina tool. The virtual docking tested the binding of a set of molecules specially selected for drug screening: the NCBI maximum diver -\nsity set II. The af\ufb01nity of molecules to bind the active site was assessed by the minimum free energy in Kcal/mol. \nRESULTS\nFrameshifting prediction. We used Knotinframe pro -\ngram [14] to detect cis-acting signals, the nucleotide sequence and the position of the heptameric slippery sites and near pseudoknots as prediction for \u22121 PRF. A list of genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 (NC 045512.2) where a frameshifting signal was predicted by the KnotInFrame program is shown in Table 1. The stability of every predicted structure is also indicated by the MFE value, on the rightmost column. A more negative value of MFE represents a more stable and likely to be a func -\ntional structure. This value is mainly dependent on the length of the sequence. The pseudoknot we propose associated with the pattern sequence at position 76 (UUUAAAA) that was iden -\nti\ufb01ed as \u22121 PRF, is ranked fourth and exhibit the lowest MFE mined in the previous step as a reliable trait of biological rele -\nvance. The conservation of the sequence of interest was evalu -\nated in two steps. First, the conservation between SARS-CoV-2 \nand other human and animal hosted coronavirus genomes was studied by the computation of a cladogram and by the search for the alignment of the sequence of interest against a com -\nprehensive viral database. A total of 21 high quality genomes from coronavirus hosted in humans and other species were selected based on subjective criteria regarding variability and relevant facts to build a cladogram. The genomes were down -\nloaded from GenBank and aligned with Clustal Omega [18] using the default parameters. The cladogram was constructed using a maximum likelihood estimate with FastTree [19], under a GTT model of nucleotide evolution. The package ggtree [20] was used in R [21] to generate the graphic of the cladogram and the multiple sequence alignment (MSA). In addition to this alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 and another 20 coronavirus ge -\nnomes, the sequence of interest was examined by ViroBLAST [22]. This tool provides a blastn [23] alignment with a com -\nprehensive database of all types of virus, so that we would as -\nsess any casual homology with any other virus. Secondly, we evaluated the conservation of the sequence of interest within SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different geographic locations since the onset of the pandemic. We took advantage of the fast con -\ntribution of genomes into the GISAID database. We \ufb01ltered the genomes in the database in order to retain only high quality records (length greater than 29,000 nt and with a low number of undetermined positions). The number of variant site strains was assessed by blastn [23], making the distinction of variants at the whole 5\u2019UTR region (1-265 nucleotide positions); and the number of variants at the position of the sequence of in -\nterest. Further individual inspections of mismatched genomes were conducted to ensure whether the variation was not due to technical sequencing reasons.\nSlippery sequence Slippery pos.

The IPknot tool [15] \nhas been used in two fashions, \ufb01rstly by the only input of the sequence of interest and secondly, by the input of the whole 5\u2019UTR region, and then cutting out the prediction for positions 7:130. In both cases, IPknot predicts a knotted structure just downstream of the slippery region (the pattern of opening and closing brackets do not match, meaning that stem-loops bind to outer regions). Interestingly, the prediction we obtained us -\ning IPknot fully agrees with the prediction obtained recently in that genomic area using the Rosetta tool [11].\nSimilarly, the secondary structure of the whole 5\u2019UTR \nregions was also obtained by IPknot tool and the graphical representation of that secondary structure using the VARNA software [26] is shown in Figure 2. Upon the inspection of the secondary structure, a sequence of interest spanning from position 74:130 was selected (left top corner) to include the value among the predictions on the whole genome. However, \nall the other structured sequences are longer and this causes their stability not to be so much signi\ufb01cantly higher than the region we propose associated with the slippery sequence locat -\ned at position 76.\nRNA 2D structure. The selected predicted frameshifting \nregion clearly falls into the 5\u2019UTR of NC\\_045512.2 reference genome [14], which spans from 1 to 265 nt as the \ufb01rst start co -\ndon for the coding sequence is at 266 position in SARS-CoV-2. However, if \u22121 PRF occurs within the 5\u2019UTR region, probably at the U nucleotide at position 95 nt, then there is an upstream AUG codon at position 107 that can act as start codon and viral translation might be altered. The sequence of interest spanning from position 74:130 was selected and it is shown in Figure 1 along with the secondary structure as predicted by Figure 1 Segment of 5\u2019UTR NC 045512 sequence and different predicted secondary \nstructures.

A minor difference in one nucleotide was found in a bat sequence (MT996532), while the differences increased in the pangolin hosted virus, and SARS-CoV-1 (NC\\_004718, Tor2 strain). Subsequently, we also tested the sequence of interest for similarity to other viruses on the Viroblast database [22]. The search parameters were kept at nominal values except for the word length, which was changed from ten to seven to increase the likelihood of matching slippery sequences. Viroblast search yielded 10 hits derived from two sources (Table 2): the top four hits were coronaviruses isolated in China from different species of bat Rhinolophus pusillus /sinicus between 2011 and 2017 \nand the latest hits a mouse-adapted laboratory model derived from SARS-CoV (consecutive GenBank accession numbers from HQ890526 to HQ890531.1; although these isolates were sam -\npled from the Urbani strain GenBank AY278741 rather than Tor2). Finally, we evaluated the conservation of the sequence of interest among clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The 5\u2019UTR (1-265 nucleotide positions) of NC\\_045512.2 was searched using BLASTN [23] analysis against 54,466 high quality \ufb01ltered ge -\nnomes (out of 84,140) retrieved from GISAID on the 21st of August, 2020. While, only a 19,8% of the genomes (10,789 out of 54,466) had a 100\\% identity in the complete 5\u2019UTR, the 74\u2014130 region was highly conserved, as it was 100\\% identical in 99.3 % of SARS-CoV-2 genomes tested (53,077 out of 53,456).\nRNA 3D structure.  In order to carry out molecular dock-\ning on potential active sites of the sequence of interest was continued the nucleotide sequence in the Figure 1 and the se -\nlected region of the secondary structure in Figure 2 as inputs into RNAcomposer [24] to obtain a .pdb \ufb01le of the nucleotide sequence. The results of the predicted 3D structure and the possible location of a drug binding site are shown in Figure 5. The volume of the binding site is the result of the exploration with Autodock tools. The coordinates of the binding site were obtained in .pdb format and they were passed into Autodock \nVina (the exhaustiveness search parameter at a default value of eight; and the random seed sequence was \ufb01xed) [25]. The results of the docking by Autodock Vina against the lead com -\npounds from the NCBI Maximum Diversity set II are shown in Table 3. The Autodock Vina predicted the af\ufb01nity of the lead compounds by the computation of the MFE. As more negative values of MFE mean higher binding af\ufb01nities, so the lead com -\npounds were ranked by this value. The number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors and the molecular weight in g/mol are annotation data from PubChem. These data show how like -\nly a compound is to be used as an oral drug [27].\nDISCUSSION\nThis study has revealed a previously unnoticed feature in \nthe SARS-CoV-2 genome, which is likely to play a biological role on account of the remarkable conservation of its sequence and stability of the structure. The close occurrence of the slip -\npery sequence and a likely stable pseudoknot suggests that this may be an area of frameshifting, in addition to the previous -\nly described overlapping region of ORF1a and ORF1b, where frameshifting has been proven for SARS-CoV [8] and also pres-ent in SARS-CoV-2 [9]. We focused on a different region, pre -\nviously unnoticed in the 5\u2019UTR. The fact that no protein may be linked with the sequence may argue against frameshifting, as may that of the overlap between ORF1a and ORF1b. Supporting the role of 5\u2019UTR, Zhu et al. [28] demonstrated that different natural deletions in the 5\u2019UTR of FMDV (foot-and-mouth dis -\nease virus) markedly affected the pathogenicity and species tropism of the virus. Frameshifting linked with 5\u2019UTR has been described in HIV-1 [29], and in this case the structure next to the slippery sequence is a stem and loop, without additional pseudoknotting. \nAnother important endeavour of this work is to consider \nthis RNA structured area as a useful target for feasible drug Putative Secondary Structure at 5\u2019UTR as a Potential Antiviral Target against SARS-CoV-2 E. Garcia-Moran, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 204-212 211intervention. Puzzlingly, the description of a possible drug \nagainst the pseudoknot involved in frameshifting between OR-F1a and ORF1b in SARS-CoV did not progress to an actual drug for use in health care [12,30], probably due to the lag in time of this discovery after the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak. The same molecule that was found to inhibit viral replication of SARS-CoV appears to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 [9].\nRangan et al. [11] performed a wide analysis on the SARS-\nCoV-2 and SARSr-CoV genomes, and they classi\ufb01ed multiple regions in terms of the conservation and RNA structure. In agreement with our approach, they consider that structured regions would be ideal targets for small drug molecules. In Ta -\nble 2 (eighth row) of their article, they describe, among others, sequence 40:157 of NC\\_045512-2 as highly conserved and structured. We reproduce in Figure 1 their proposal of struc-ture for our region of interest. The result of the alignment of our sequence of interest against the Viroblast database showed that the sequence may have been close to SARS-CoV as de -\nscribed in 2003 [31]. We found two pathways of highly similar sequences; coronaviruses isolated from bats in the following years and from laboratory-derived strains developed to create a mouse-adapted model from the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV-2. Although outside of this work, these \ufb01ndings support the role of bats as intermediate hosts between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the possibility that some unrecognized variation in strains of SARS-CoV would manifest relevant features as with the sequence which we describe. \nA limitation of our work is that it was restricted to compu -\ntational analysis. This shortcoming is likely more relevant when it comes to the determination of the tridimensional structure of RNA and its subsequent docking. The determination of the crystal structure 3D prediction and drug docking has been de -\nveloped for proteins rather than RNA. One of the features of RNA that makes docking dif\ufb01cult is its \ufb02exibility. However, suc -\ncessful discovery of ligands against SARS-Cov-2 pseudoknot by a computed 3D structure has been described before [12,30]. Clinical evidence of pharmacological actions against RNA viral genomes was achieved by drugs such as sofosbuvir (tradename Sovaldi) against Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). These drugs are de -\nscribed as nucleotide analogues. They bind to the target region as a complementary sequence would do but they differ from short chains of nucleotides so that they may resist lytic en -\nzymes.\nOur screening for drug ligands was an exploratory analy -\nsis, as it was limited to 1,507 compounds from NCBI maximum diversity set II. In Table 3 several compounds have a MFE lower than -10 Kcal/mol. This suggests that a search against a larger catalog would yield multiple candidates. Several compounds on the Table 3 can meet the criteria to be orally useful drugs according to Lipinski\u2019s rule of \ufb01ve [29]. We point out that the compound ranked second in terms of MFE af\ufb01nity: NSC 308835 as it meets every Lipinski\u2019s criterion. The next best compound did not meet that molecular weight, which should be less than 500 g/mol, though by a small margin. This fact does not pre -\nclude oral activity. NSC61610 was given orally, once a day to mice in an experimental model of H1N1 in\ufb02uenza infection [32]. The mice had less mortality and the response was better \nthan with tami\ufb02u after the sixth day of infection. However, that mechanism of action is unrelated to interactions with viral RNA, as NSC61610 acts as a modulator of the immune response. \nIn conclusion, we have identi\ufb01ed a relevant sequence in \nthe 5\u2019UTR region of SARS-CoV-2. It displays traits which have a high potential for playing an important role, either through frameshifting or other mechanism. A remarkable conservation within SARS-CoV-2 isolates strongly supports a biological role for this sequence. Our analysis of the drug susceptibility of this sequence is hindered by the inconsistent predictions of bioin-formatic tools. It is however very likely that a strong structure of this area will allow effective action of relatively simple drug molecules.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe kindly acknowledge Dr. Nigel Cook for English revision.\nFUNDING\nNone to declare.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare no con\ufb02ict of interest.\nREFERENCES\n1.

We aimed to compare the actual consump-\ntion of antibiotics among patients issued delayed antibiotic \nprescribing with the consumption observed in a non-system -\natic review of studies on delayed prescribing.\nMethods. Observational study carried out in three prima -\nry care centres from September 2018 until March 2020. We tracked the electronic records of the 82 patients with episodes of acute bronchitis and 44 acute pharyngitis who were given a patient-led delayed prescription to determine whether the prescription was \ufb01lled and when this medication was obtained. \nResults. The prescriptions were never \ufb01lled in 50 cases \n(39.7%), but \ufb01ve patients took another antibiotic within the \ufb01rst two weeks. Out of 76 patients who did take the delayed prescription, only 12 obtained the medication based on the in -\nstructions given by the doctors (15.8%).\nConclusions. The strategy of delayed antibiotic prescrib-\ning resulted in a reduction in antibiotic use, but this reduction was lower than in randomised clinical trials, being compara -\nble to the results obtained with other observational studies on delayed antibiotic prescribing. In addition, only a few patients adhered to the doctors\u2019 instructions. \nKeywords: Antimicrobial Stewardship; Primary Health Care; Antibacterial \nAgents.\nCorrespondence:\nCarl LlorUniversity Institute in Primary Care Research Jordi Gol, Via Roma Health Centre, BarcelonaGran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 497, atic - 08007 BarcelonaE-mail: carles.llor@gmail.comImplementation of the delayed antibiotic prescribing strategy. Prospective observation study in primary care C. Llor, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 213-217 214urban primary care centres in Catalonia, Spain. All the partic -\nipating GPs were familiar with the delayed prescribing tech -\nnique and routinely employed it in their practice. Eligible sub -\njects were those of any age presenting with a sore throat with \ntwo Centor criteria, or uncomplicated acute bronchitis, de\ufb01ned as cough without chest signs in patients without lung comor -\nbidity, as recommended by the updated version of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline (NICE) on RTI [3], who were visited in the different consultations from September 2018 until March 2020. We decided to stop recruit-ing patients at that moment because of the onset of the COV -\nID-19 pandemic. \nThe recruiting doctor issued an antibiotic prescription \nduring the consultation but advised the patient to use it after three days in the case of sore throat and after seven days for episodes of acute bronchitis and only in the absence of spon -\ntaneous improvement as suggested by the NICE guideline [3]. Patients were also given the sheet recommended by the Plan Nacional de Resistencia a los Antibi\u00f3ticos (PRAN) of the Span-ish Agency of Medicines and Health Products (Supplementa -\nry material - Appendix 1). Patients were informed about their participation in a study on rationalising antibiotic treatment, but they were not aware of the real objective in an attempt not to in\ufb02uence their behaviour (Supplementary material - Appendix 2). Participating GPs registered whether the patients \ufb01lled the prescription given and tracked the information col -\nlected in the electronic records within the \ufb01rst two weeks after the index consultation. In case patients collected the antibiotic they were called by the same GPs to make sure when they at -con\ufb02ict may also make GPs feel uncomfortable with the decision \nof whether to prescribe. Delayed prescribing could potentially address the patient\u2019s expectation of an antibiotic prescription, but also the GP\u2019s clinical uncertainty, while minimising actual antibiotic consumption. To put it brie\ufb02y, a GP offers an antibiot -\nic prescription, but asks the patient to wait for no spontaneous improvement before deciding whether to obtain the antibiotic at the community pharmacy. A recent individual patient data meta-analysis showed that this strategy is a safe and effective strategy for most patients, including those in higher risk sub-groups and is associated with similar symptom duration as no antibiotic prescribing and is unlikely to lead to a worse symptom control than immediate antibiotic prescribing [1]. \nA 2017 systematic Cochrane Collaboration review, includ -\ning randomised clinical trials (RCT), found that delayed antibi -\notic prescriptions were associated with signi\ufb01cantly decreased antibiotic use as 31% of the cases admitted to taking the an -\ntibiotic [2]. However, the actual use of antibiotics in current practice might be higher than that reported in clinical trials. We assessed whether patients given a delayed prescription \ufb01lled it or not, and if so, how many days after the index consultation was the antibiotic obtained, and we compared our results with a non-systematic review of studies on delayed antibiotic prescrib -\ning aimed at evaluating the actual consumption of antibiotics differentiating RCTs and observational studies. \nMETHODS\nPatients were recruited from 6 general practices in three \nFigure 1 Distribution of patients with RTIs and their attitude about the delayed \nantibiotic prescribing given.0510152025303540\nAntibiotic not\ncollectedAntibiotic collected as\nadvisedAntibiotic collected\nbefore recommended\ndayAntibiotic collected\nimmediatelyAnot her a nt ibiot ic\ncollectedn\nAcute bronchitis Sore throatFigure 1 .

The \nprescriptions were never obtained in 50 cases (39.7%). Howev-er, \ufb01ve patients admitted taking another antibiotic within the \ufb01rst two weeks after the index consultation. Therefore, a total of 81 patients obtained an antibiotic for that episode in the 2-week follow-up period (64.3%).

Prospective observation study in primary care C. Llor, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 213-217 216Qualitative studies carried out in Spain report that some \npatients feel uncomfortable about being given the decision \nabout when to use antibiotics and others report taking \u2018de-layed\u2019 antibiotics immediately, as also suggested in our study. Some clinicians think that the strategy helps empower pa-tients, provides reassurance, and helps to meet their expec -\ntations, but others expressed concerns about patients using them inappropriately, about masking serious illness, and about medicolegal problems [23]. Apart from giving this information sheet, GPs should be trained about the duration of delay and provide advice regarding the limited effectiveness of antibi -\notics, their disadvantages, and when to consider using these drugs. Otherwise, poor clinician adherence is likely to under -\nmine the effectiveness of the strategy. Opinion leaders may be able to play a role in increasing awareness about the need for clear communication as part of any delayed prescribing strate -\ngy. It is obvious that the delayed strategy is only valid in some cases. If doctors think that an antibiotic therapy is not war -\nranted, a delayed antibiotic strategy should not be used un-less there is clear and voiced antibiotic demand for therapy by patients [24]. A \u2018no antibiotic strategy\u2019 is always preferable to a delayed antibiotic prescribing strategy. If delayed prescrib-ing is offered, a clear explanation is needed about the advice to be given to patients about when to use their prescription (symptoms not resolved, not getting better, getting worse) and about safety netting (when to reconsult). If this is not voiced during the consultation, we might create confusion by sending mixed messages to patients such as \u2018an antibiotic is not need -\ned, but here is an antibiotic\u2019. \nIn conclusion, the strategy of delayed antibiotic prescrib -\ning is associated with a lower antibiotic consumption, but this reduction is lower than expected and only a few patients ad -\nhered to the doctors\u2019 instructions. Although this strategy could be valid in some cases doctors should prefer a no antibiotic strategy and deprescribing antibiotic courses already initiated if they no longer consider they are appropriate.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nTo the doctors and the patients who participated in this \nstudy.\nFUNDING\nNone to declare\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nCL reports receiving research grants from Abbott Diagnos-\ntics.

Delayed antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections: Figure 1, only 12 patients obtained the medication based on \nthe instructions given by the doctors (15.8%).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this observational study of adults presenting with sore \nthroat and acute bronchitis, the strategy of the delayed antibi -\notic prescribing results in a reduction in antibiotic use, but this reduction is not as high as the percentage observed in RCTs. In addition, only a small percentage of patients obtaining the medication adhered to the doctors\u2019 instructions. \nDespite not asking about the actual consumption of antibi -\notics, 64.3% of the patients \ufb01lled the delayed prescription at the pharmacy or declared taking another antibiotic. This result is not different from the actual consumption of antibiotics observed in the different studies on delayed antibiotic consumption carried out in observational studies. As shown in table 1, the actual an -\ntibiotic consumption among patients assigned to different types of delayed prescribing ranged from 19.8% to 47.8% in the dif -\nferent RCTs published to date [4-14] and from 31.4% to 72.9% in observational studies [15-22]. Observational studies better re\ufb02ect daily practice. In RCTs of delayed prescribing GPs are usu -\nally instructed to use the approach as part of a full recommen -\ndation that includes advice about the limited effectiveness and disadvantages of using antibiotics for an infectious condition and advice about the likely time course of their symptoms and how to decide when to take the antibiotic. Symptoms of RTIs usually take longer than patients expect, and therefore advice about how long to delay the prescription is an important ele -\nment of this recommendation. Inappropriate provision of advice is a possible reason for the difference in the reported consump -\ntion found in RCTs of this approach and in this study. The meth -\nod of delivering the delayed prescription to the patient may also in\ufb02uence how delayed prescriptions are used. As shown in table 1 consumption of delayed antibiotics is lower if it is left up to the patients to collect the prescription at a later point rather than being given to the patient during the consultation. The re -\nsults of our study are not dissimilar to those of observational studies using the same approach. In a study carried out in 13 European countries, in which 55% of the 169 participants, who provided data about the antibiotic consumption when a delayed antibiotic prescribing was offered, consumed an antibiotic dur -\ning the study period [20]. In this study, 30% started taking their delayed antibiotics on the day that they were prescribed [20].\nThis study has several limitations. We cannot ensure that \nall the patients who \ufb01lled the prescription had taken the medi -\ncation, which is the most important limitation of this study. We recruited only 126 patients as the study described routine care in only a few primary care centres. Nonetheless, we do not con -\nsider that the results would have been much different if we had recruited more patients. Participants agreed to participate in a study on rationalising antibiotic therapy and this could have af -\nfected their behaviour; however, they were not informed about its real objective. Patients were not randomised; however, data on routine prescribing behaviour in everyday clinical practice can only be obtained through observational data as in our study.Implementation of the delayed antibiotic prescribing strategy.

This \ufb01nding reinforces the possibility of the infectious cause, and it may be due bacteria of the skin \ufb02ora (bacterial adenitis due to S. aureus) or bacteria related to \nan occupational context. Let us remember that these wounds had been in\ufb02icted by cats, so the cat scratch disease, caused by B. henselae should be evaluated \ufb01rst, without forgetting oth-er zoonoses such as those transmitted by \ufb02eas or ticks (Lyme disease, rickettsiosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis or tularemia) [4].\nPERFORMED TESTS AND CLINICAL EVOLUTION\nIn the OPD, it was requested a thoracoabdominal Com -\nputerized Tomography (CT) to search for other regions lym -\nphadenopathy and a complete analysis with biochemistry, hemogram, peripheral blood morphology, proteinogram, im -\nmunoglobulins, in\ufb02ammatory reactants, autoimmunity study (rheumatoid factor, Anti-nuclear Antibodies and Extractable Nuclear Antibody), Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs; M. tuberculosis) and serologies of T. pallidum, EBV, T. gondii, Cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis B and C Virus, Human Immunode -\n\ufb01ciency Virus, C. burnetii, B. henselae and Rickettsia spp. The \nCT scan (Image 2) was normal except for the already known adenopathy in axilla. All blood studies were normal, including in\ufb02ammatory reactants, except for serologies, being Bartonel-\nla spp. pathological, with results of: B. Henselae IgG, 1/4096 \n(pathological> 1/256); IgM, 1/80 (indicative of recent infec -\ntion> 1/20). B. quintana IgG 1/256, IgM 1/20 (indicative of re -\ncent infection> 1/20), by indirect immuno\ufb02uorescence. With a diagnosis of cat scratch disease, outpatient treatment was started with azithromycin 500 mg orally one day, followed by 250 mg orally daily for 4 more days. IgG titers for B. henselae\nwere reduced by half two months later. The patient is currently asymptomatic.\nDISCUSSION\nTo solve this case we started from a pathological diag -\nnosis, but it was the anamnesis and examination that led us to diagnosis. We acknowledge that the order of action should have been inverse and that a PCR of B. henselae at the sample \nwould have made the diagnosis.\nNGL can be produced by various diseases that have been \ndescribed above [1]. Granulomas are organized aggregates of macrophages and other immune cells that arise as biological structures in response to persistent (infectious or not) stimuli. Although they are defensive complexes, they can also trans -\nform into differentiated pathological structures. One of these would be necrosis, produced by macrophages. For reasons not entirely understood yet, some granulomas remain without ne -\ncrosis (those caused by beryllium, sarcoidosis or Crohn\u2019s dis -\nease), while others, especially those caused by tuberculosis In addition to the above-mentioned pathology data, the \npatient had a normal chest X-ray and mammography.\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\nIn summary, we have a patient without any type of gen -\neral or infectious symptoms, with a family history of cancer \nand a single lymphadenopathy located in the left axilla with a pathological diagnosis that shows NGL. Regarding these data, the working diagnosis in based in two aetiologies of her condi-tion: infectious and non-infectious.\nAmong the non-infectious causes it can be found sar -\ncoidosis, a disease that can be paucisymptomatic and, al -\nthough in most cases there are enlarged hiliar lymph nodes, they can also occur in extrapulmonary territories such as the axilla. Others that should be taken into account would be hae -\nmatological malignancies (Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lym -\nphoma), berylliosis and tumor metastases, which rarely cause necrosis [1]. It should be noted that there was a necrotizing component in the adenopathy, which would make it neces -\nsary to include Kikuchi\u2019s disease, in which adenopathies are the most frequent sign although they are usually cervical and more typical in children and young people [2], and systemic lu -\npus erythematosus [3], but there were no other signs or symp -\ntoms leading to this diagnosis.\nAs for infectious causes, the differential diagnosis is \nbroader. We could further divide infectious entities in sup-purative and non-suppurative causes. Among the former are tularemia, cat scratch disease, Yersinia pestis and fungal in-fections. Regarding the non-suppurative ones, the possibility of tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, toxoplasmosis, leprosy, syphilis, brucellosis and some types of fungi should be considered. Some of these diseases are highly unlikely, due to the almost complete lack of symptoms and location of the lymph node. For instance, Y. pestis infection would affect \nmesenteric lymph nodes, within a general picture of severe disease; in Epstein-Barr Virus infection (EBV), enlarged lymph Figure 2  The CT scan was normal except for the \nalready known adenopathy in axilla.\nWoman with necrotising granulomatous lymphadenitis: the key was in anamnesis and physical examination D. S\u00e1nchez Fabra, et al.\nRev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 218-221 220Regarding treatment, there have been discrepancies clas-\nsically in the literature about the use of antibiotics because \nin many cases cat scratch disease can be self-limited [10] al -\nthough clinical practice guidelines recommend treatment in patients over 45 kg with 500 mg of azithromycin the \ufb01rst day followed by 250 mg per day for 4 more days. Patients weigh -\ning less than 45 kg (paediatrics) the dose would be 10 mg/kg the \ufb01rst day and 5 mg/kg the four following [20].\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS\nCat scratch disease caused by B. henselae.\nFUNDING\nNone to declare\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nAuthors declare no con\ufb02ict of interests\nREFERENCES\n1.

Published online 2011. doi:10.1136/bcr.11.2010.3548and other infectious diseases (especially intracellular bacteria \nand fungi) do undergo it [5]. In a Danish study, 121 patients with lymphadenopathy with granulomatous in\ufb02ammation in the neck and head were analysed. The most frequent diagnoses were sarcoidosis (26%), tuberculosis (22%), cat scratch disease (6%), non-tuberculous mycobacteria (7%), tumors (2%) and others (4%), with 33% of the patients without an established diagnosis. In the case of tuberculosis, the granulomas were normally necrotizing, being non-necrotizing in sarcoidosis [6]. However, a German study found that cat scratch diseases was present in 13.4% of the 454 patient with head and neck lymphadenopathy analysed, being reticular abscessed granu -\nloma the most frequent pathological \ufb01nding [7]. Diagnosis in the case of NGL can be challenging because the probability of tuberculosis is remarkable and the detection of bacilli may not be possible with conventional methods due to the low bacillary load in certain extrapulmonary territories, being necessary oc-casionally to con\ufb01rm the diagnosis according to the response to anti-tuberculosis treatment [8,9].\nCat scratch disease is an infectious disease caused by B. \nhenselae, a Gram-negative bacillus found in cats and \ufb02eas. It can be transmitted to humans through bites or scratches. The typical presentation is in children and usually presents with soft, enlarged and sometimes suppurative adenopathy, especially if there has been exposure to cats (mostly kittens, as happened in our case). One or two weeks after the inocu -\nlation wound, unilateral regional lymphadenopathies appear, which can persist for months. Other symptoms present may be malaise, arthromyalgia, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Visceral involvement has also been described, mainly hepatospleno-megaly with or without lymphadenopathy, as well as fever of unknown origin in children and occasionally meningoenceph -\nalitis, endocarditis and ocular involvement [10]. In immuno-suppressed patients, B. henselae can cause bacillary angioma-tosis, in which multisystem involvement can occur, especially skin, bone, liver and spleen [11,12].\nRegarding epidemiology in Spain, seroprevalence in cats \nhas been found in 29-78% of samples [13\u201315]. In humans, some studies have shown differences in seroactivity against B. \nhenselae, especially considering the variable titers limit chosen to stablish exposure or infection. We could found serological evidence of B. henselae in 8.7-13.55% [16,17] of healthy peo-ple, being higher in occupational jobs like veterinaries (37.1%) [18].\nDiagnosis is serological, because B. henselae is dif\ufb01cult to \nculture. Titers less than 1:64 make the diagnosis unlikely; be -\ntween 1:64 and 1: 256 imply possible infection; greater than 1:256 make it very likely. IgM positivity suggests recent infec -\ntion. It is important to highlight, as it happened in our case, that cross-reactivity frequently occurs in IgG titers between B. \nhenselae and B. quintana. PCR tests can help to achieve di -\nagnosis [10], although in our case the clinical history and the evaluation of the titers of both serologies were conclusive since, although B. quintana can cause trench fever and a sim -\nilar clinical picture, is associated with the presence of lice and poor hygienic sanitary conditions [19].Woman with necrotising granulomatous lymphadenitis: the key was in anamnesis and physical examination D.

She received intravenous megadoses of methylprednisolone, but after 24h she experienced worsen-ing of her symptoms: pain, strength loss in her low extremities and walking dif\ufb01culties. Serology studies were negative, except Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM. Oligoclonal bands, anti-my-elin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (MOG-abs), an-ti-aquaporin 4 antibodies, all tested negative. MRI neuroimaging demonstrated thickening of right optic nerve, small supra and infratentorial demyelinating lesions and large dorsal myelitis, all of these suggested ADEM. We started plasmapheresis with excellent response, showing improvement in optic disc swelling, visual \ufb01eld defect and strength loss, although she needed phys -\nical rehabilitation. She followed treatment with low descendent dose of oral steroids to avoid further relapses. \nADEM is usually seen in prepuberal patients preceded by \na viral infection or post vaccination [1,2], and less frequently post-bacterial infection caused by Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, \nLegionella, Campylobacter and Streptococcus [7], but main \ncauses are measles, rubella and chickenpox [8]. It is unclear whether central nervous system affection is due to direct Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection or antibodies produced against this pathogen cross-react with myelin antigens [7]. Ex-trapulmonary complications of this infection include enceph-alitis, optic neuritis, psychosis, stroke, cranial nerve palsies, aseptic meningitis and it can trigger immune mediated neu-rological diseases such as ADEM, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and transverse myelitis [9,10]. Encephalitis  is common in children, and up to a 20% of patients do not have respiratory compro -\nmise, as in our case [10]. Diagnosis can be made with PCR (gold standard) or serology (IgM for Mycoplasma pneumoniae). It is \nan important differential diagnosis in demyelinating diseases in prepuberal patients. Antibiotic treatment in controversial, it was not used in our case [8]. Visual prognosis in optic neuritis due to ADEM is good when it is diagnosed early and treated aggressively [3].

Rap -\nid onset encephalopathy associated with neurological de\ufb01cits preceded by a prodromal phase (fever, nausea, headache) is the most common presentation. Neurologic features depend on the location of lesions: pyramidal signs, hemiplegia, ataxia, cranial nerve palsies, visual loss due to optic neuritis, seizures, spinal cord involvement, aphasia, coma. Optic neuritis (ON) represents a 7-23% of cases [1,3\u20136],  so it is not the most com -\nmon form of presentation. Lesions in ADEM are multiple and asymmetric, affecting subcortical and central white matter and cortical gray-white junction. Gray matter of thalami and basal ganglia are also involved [1]. Diagnosis is made based on clinical and radiological \ufb01ndings. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) results can be classi\ufb01ed in 4 types: a) Small lesions, b) Large, tumefactive lesions c) Symmetric bithalamic affection, d) Acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis. Spinal cord involve -\nment is reported to represent 11-28%, typically in the thoracic region [1]. Differential diagnosis is challenging, and multiple sclerosis should be considered [1,2]. Steroids, intravenous im-munoglobulin and plasma exchange are the main used treat -\nments.

ADEM-ON has been classi\ufb01ed as an entity within \u201cMOG-spectrum dis -\norder\u201d. MOG-abs positivity is common in children with optic nerve affection, since MOG is a glycoprotein that is only pres -\nent in the CNS, it maintains myelin sheath integrity. Their pos -\nitivity supports the diagnosis; these antibodies have also been related to the risk of new events [5]. Particularities of our case are that ON preceded ADEM, time between both events was 24h and MOG-abs resulted negative.

In\ufb02ammatory optic neuritis is a frequent cause of acute visual loss in young adults, although visual prognosis is excellent in most cases, many patients de -\nvelop demyelinating lesions during its evolution. ON was de-scribed as a form of relapsing course of the disease, with one or more episodes of ON [5], but as a form of presentation, preceding ADEM, it is infrequent [1,7].

La embriotransferencia transcurre sin incidencias rese\u00f1ables y a los 14 d\u00edas se realiza determinaci\u00f3n de B-hcG s\u00e9rica con resultado negativo. Tras \ufb01-nalizar esta primera FIV se reeval\u00faa a la paciente, objetivando persistencia de cl\u00ednica cervical, por lo que se procede a estudios microbiol\u00f3gicos de exudados vaginal y endocervical seg\u00fan pro-tocolos [6]. S\u00f3lo se encontr\u00f3 que, tras 24 horas de incubaci\u00f3n en CO\n2, crecieron abundantes colonias en cultivo puro en el \nmedio de agar sangre (Becton-Dickinson, Espa\u00f1a) y agar cho -\ncolate (Becton-Dickinson) que se identi\ufb01caron correctamente mediante MALDI-TOF (Bruker Biotyper, Billerica, MA, USA), con un score 2,103, como S. pneumoniae, sensible a optoquina (BD BBL, Espa\u00f1a) en disco. Los estudios de PCR para C. trachoma-\ntis, N. gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma spp., Ureaplasma spp. y vi -\nrus del herpes simple (BD Max, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostics, Sparks, MD, EE.

Infecciones por Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum y VIH son las m\u00e1s relevantes en cuanto a esterilidad, \npero queda menos claro el rol que desempe\u00f1an otros microor -\nganismos [1,2]. En las cervicitis se reduce la posibilidad de concepci\u00f3n espont\u00e1nea [3] pero se considera al factor cervi -\ncal una causa inusual de esterilidad y soslayan su importancia mediante \u201cinseminaci\u00f3n uterina\u201d o \u201cfecundaci\u00f3n in-vitro\u201d (FIV) Tambi\u00e9n se ha demostrado una reducci\u00f3n en la tasa de reci\u00e9n nacido vivo mediante FIV en los casos con sangre en el cat\u00e9ter de transferencia embrionaria por una cervicitis cl\u00ednica inadver -\ntida [4]. Streptococcus pneumoniae coloniza el tracto respi-ratorio superior y de forma transitoria puede formar parte de la microbiota comensal del tracto genital femenino, pudiendo producir en raros casos infecciones cervicales y p\u00e9lvicas, espe -\ncialmente si existen factores predisponentes [5].\nEn este trabajo se presenta el caso de una pareja que con -\nsulta por esterilidad primaria de dos a\u00f1os de evoluci\u00f3n con aislamiento de S. pneumoniae y que desaparece tras el trata -\nmiento con antibi\u00f3ticos. \nMujer de 31 a\u00f1os sin antecedentes m\u00e9dicos de inter\u00e9s. \nNiega h\u00e1bitos t\u00f3xicos.

Sin embargo, S. pneumo-\nniae puede acceder a la mucosa vaginal por contaminaci\u00f3n de las manos o por pr\u00e1ctica sexual orogenital o v\u00eda hemat\u00f3gena, como se ha descrito con otras especies [7]. Entre los factores de riesgo para colonizaci\u00f3n del tracto genital se encuentran el uso de dispositivos intrauterinos, periodo posparto o posaborto o cirug\u00eda ginecol\u00f3gica reciente [8]. Ninguna de estas circuns -\ntancias concurr\u00eda en el caso expuesto. Consideramos que la cervicitis provocada por este microorganismo podr\u00eda estar con -\ntribuyendo a un descenso en la fertilidad natural de la pareja, as\u00ed como a un fracaso tras transferencia embrionaria. Se des -\nconoce la patogenia de la obstrucci\u00f3n tub\u00e1rica de la paciente, que no reconoc\u00eda haber padecido previamente ning\u00fan episodio cl\u00ednico compatible con enfermedad p\u00e9lvica in\ufb02amatoria. Ade -\nm\u00e1s, desconocemos si estaba vacunada frente al neumococo, aunque manifest\u00f3 haber realizado correctamente la vacuna -\nci\u00f3n durante su etapa infantil. Sin embargo, dada la edad de la paciente en el momento del estudio y al no estar incluida en ning\u00fan grupo de riesgo, lo m\u00e1s probable es que no estuviese vacunada dado que esta vacuna se incluy\u00f3 en calendario va-cunal universal bastante m\u00e1s tarde. Finalmente, no se han pu -\nblicados episodios de aislamientos de neumococo en exudado cervical de pacientes est\u00e9riles, ni evidencias que lo justi\ufb01quen. \nEn conclusi\u00f3n, los estudios microbiol\u00f3gicos del aparato \ngenital deber\u00edan ser amplios, no limit\u00e1ndose a poblaciones de riesgo y empleando pruebas que permitan la detecci\u00f3n de pa-t\u00f3genos estrictos y oportunistas, ya que de forma indirecta se reduce el riesgo de infertilidad de origen infeccioso.

En los 5 posteriores an\u00e1lisis seriados realizados hasta la fecha, los hemocultivos fueron negativos y los reactantes de fase aguda han permanecido dentro del rango de normalidad. En las siguientes ecocardiograf\u00edas transesof\u00e1gicas, se observan vegetaciones de menor tama\u00f1o en el electrodo (m\u00e1ximo 7 mm) sin afectaci\u00f3n prot\u00e9sica ni de otras v\u00e1lvulas. La persistencia de estas vegetaciones en un paciente sin tratamiento antibi\u00f3tico supresor, con hemocultivos negativos y completamente asinto -\nm\u00e1tico, puede sugerir que son vegetaciones est\u00e9riles.\nEl caso descrito, es una entidad rara en adultos y presenta ISSN: 0214-3429 / \u00a9The Author 2022.

Several medical controls were scheduled, and after 2 days after implementing these meas -\nures, patient recovered without complications (\ufb01gure 1B). After ten days of follow-up, no sequel was observed, and patient was happily discharged home.\nAs far as we concerned, this is the \ufb01rst reported case of \nremdesivir extravasation with successful management in the literature treated with only dry warm. As described recently, hyaluronidase could be also an option after in\ufb01ltration of acid -\nic drugs to disperse and dilute the in\ufb01ltrated drug (specially high amount of drugs) [1, 4]. However, local injections of hy -\naluronidase can cause side effects such as local pruritus and allergic reactions [5]. \nRemdesivir has been authorized for emergency use in \npatients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as it reduced the median time to recovery from COVID-19 in a randomized con-trolled trial [6]. After a systematic review of published literature about remdesivir extravasations, no matched was obtained. General guidelines of non-cytotoxic extravasations recommend general measures as described before. Remdesivir was slightly acid (pH=4.11). Acid exposure commonly leads to cellular des-iccation, coagulative necrosis, and eschar formation. Edema, vasoconstriction, sloughing, and ulceration are common mani -\nfestations of acid-induced tissue injury. Management of acidic in\ufb01ltrations remains supportive. Elevation, warm compresses, and attempts to remove the extravasated material are common nonpharmacologic treatment approaches [7].\nThe use of local warming therapy (dry heat) is based on \nthe theory that it enhances vasodilation, thus enhancing the dispersion of the vesicant agent and decreasing drug accumu -\nlation in the local tissue. The use of local warming is recom -\nmended for the extravasation of non\u2013DNA-binding vesicants.\nThe correct knowledge of remdesivir management, includ -Successful management of remdesivir extravasation\n1Infectious Disease Control.

Their consequences may \ninclude tissue necrosis, compartment syndrome, infection, ul -\nceration, and partial or total loss of limb function [1, 2]. Infor -\nmation about extravasation management is scarce and often limited to case reports. Primarily , it was described remdesivir \nas a vesicant drug due to formation of blisters, hemorrhage, and localized edema when extravasated [3]. Recently three cases of remdesivir extravasation were described, two of them  treated with hyaluronidase injections [4]. However suitable early management of remdesivir extravasation re-mains unknown. Here, a successful management case of rem-\ndesivir extravasation with only dry heat is \ufb01rst described.\nA 68-year-old woman was admitted at hospital with sore \ncough, dyspnoea and dysgeusia.  Initially, she presented with typical pulmonary in\ufb01ltrates. However, on day 6 after admis -\nsion, the patient\u2019s clinical status deteriorated rapidly and di -\nagnosed with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection PCR positive. So, dexamethasone and \ufb01ve days remdesivir treatment was initi -\nated. Initially, treatment was overall well tolerated. The fourth course of remdesivir was given by peripheral intravenous in -\njection into the radial vein at the left wrist using an infusion pump. Remdesivir 100 mg in 250 mL (concentration of 0.4 mg/mL) was infused within 120 min (2.08 ml/min). Fifteen minutes before completing remdesivir infusion, the patient complained of moderate pain around the site of injection. It was suspect -\ned an extravasation. On clinical examination, the patient had an approximately 4 x 6 cm swollen area without erythema (see Figure 1A). General unspeci\ufb01c measures to treat extrava -\nsations were taken immediately as per our protocol: infusion was stopped and nurse aspired 5ml approximately, removed \nCorrespondence:\nDavid Conde Est\u00e9vezDepartment of Pharmacy, Hospital Universitari del Mar.
