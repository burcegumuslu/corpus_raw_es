Methods: Multicenter, ecological, time-series study of aggregate data for all adult patients with COVID-19 treated in five acute-care hospitals in Barcelona, Spain, between March 2020 and May 2021. Trends in the monthly prevalence of drugs used against COVID-19 were analyzed by the Mantel\u2013Haenszel test. Results: The participating hospitals admitted 22,277 patients with COVID-19 during the study period, reporting an overall mortality of 10.8%. In the first months of the pandemic, lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine were the most frequently used antivirals, but these fell into disuse and were replaced by remdesivir in July 2020. By contrast, the trend in tocilizumab use varied, first peaking in April and May 2020, declining until January 2021, and showing a discrete upward trend thereafter. Regarding corticosteroid use, we observed a notable upward trend in the use of dexamethasone 6 mg per day from July 2020. Finally, there was a high prevalence of antibiotics use, especially azithromycin, in the first three months, but this decreased thereafter. Conclusions: Treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 evolved with the changing scientific evidence during the pandemic. Initially, multiple drugs were empirically used that subsequently could not demonstrate clinical benefit. In future pandemics, stakeholders should strive to promote the early implementation of adaptive randomized clinical trials.Otros autores\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E3390%2Fantibiotics12050809&urlhash=j1Jv&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[Persistent COVID-19 symptoms 1 year after hospital discharge: A prospective multicenter study](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1371%2Fjournal%2Epone%2E0275615&urlhash=kU0T&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nPLoS One\nObjective\nTo determine the health status and exercise capacity of COVID-19 survivors one year after hospital discharge.\nMethods\nThis multicenter prospective study included COVID-19 survivors 12 months after hospital discharge.

Participants were randomly selected from a large cohort of COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized until 15th April 2020. They were interviewed about persistent symptoms, underwent a physical examination, chest X-ray, and a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). A multivariate analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for persistent dyspnea.\nResults\nOf the 150 patients included, 58% were male and the median age was 63 (IQR 54\u201372) years. About 82% reported \u22651 symptoms and 45% had not recovered their physical health. The multivariate regression analysis revealed that the female sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and smoking were independent risk factors for persistent dyspnea. Approximately 50% completed less than 80% of the theoretical distance on the 6MWT. Only 14% had an abnormal X-ray, showing mainly interstitial infiltrates. A third of them had been followed up in outpatient clinics and 6% had undergone physical rehabilitation.\nConclusion\nDespite the high rate of survivors of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with persistent symptomatology at 12 months, the follow-up and rehabilitation of these patients has been really poor. Studies focusing on the role of smoking in the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms are lacking.Otros autores\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1371%2Fjournal%2Epone%2E0275615&urlhash=kU0T&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[WHO Ordinal Scale and Inflammation Risk Categories in COVID-19.

However, it has its limitations.\nObjective\nThe present study aims to compare three classificatory and predictive models: the WHO ordinal severity scale, the model based on inflammation grades, and the hybrid model.\nDesign\nRetrospective cohort study with patient data collected and followed up from March 1, 2020, to May 1, 2021, from the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. The primary study outcome was in-hospital mortality. As this was a hospital-based study, the patients included corresponded to categories 3 to 7 of the WHO ordinal scale. Categories 6 and 7 were grouped in the same category.\nKey Results\nA total of 17,225 patients were included in the study. Patients classified as high risk in each of the WHO categories according to the degree of inflammation were as follows: 63.8% vs. 79.9% vs. 90.2% vs. 95.1% (p<0.001). In-hospital mortality for WHO ordinal scale categories 3 to 6/7 was as follows: 0.8% vs. 24.3% vs. 45.3% vs. 34% (p<0.001). In-hospital mortality for the combined categories of ordinal scale 3a to 5b was as follows: 0.4% vs. 1.1% vs. 11.2% vs. 27.5% vs. 35.5% vs. 41.1% (p<0.001). The predictive regression model for in-hospital mortality with our proposed combined ordinal scale reached an AUC=0.871, superior to the two models separately.\nConclusions\nThe present study proposes a new severity grading scale for COVID-19 hospitalized patients. In our opinion, it is the most informative, representative, and predictive scale in COVID-19 patients to date.\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1007%2Fs11606-022-07511-7&urlhash=B8HO&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[Ethnicity and Clinical Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19 in Spain: Results from the Multicenter SEMI-COVID-19 Registry](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E3390%2Fjcm11071949&urlhash=DCWN&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nJournal of Clinical Medicine\n(1) Background: This work aims to analyze clinical outcomes according to ethnic groups in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Spain.

Clinical outcomes were assessed according to ethnicity (Latin Americans, Sub-Saharan Africans, Asians, North Africans, Europeans). The outcomes were in-hospital mortality (IHM), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Associations between ethnic groups and clinical outcomes adjusted for patient characteristics and baseline Charlson Comorbidity Index values and wave were evaluated using logistic regression. (3) Results: Of 23,953 patients (median age 69.5 years, 42.9% women), 7.0% were Latin American, 1.2% were North African, 0.5% were Asian, 0.5% were Sub-Saharan African, and 89.7% were European. Ethnic minority patients were significantly younger than European patients (median (IQR) age 49.1 (40.5\u201358.9) to 57.1 (44.1\u201367.1) vs. 71.5 (59.5\u201381.4) years, p < 0.001). The unadjusted IHM was higher in European (21.6%) versus North African (11.4%), Asian (10.9%), Latin American (7.1%), and Sub-Saharan African (3.2%) patients. After further adjustment, the IHM was lower in Sub-Saharan African (OR 0.28 (0.10\u20130.79), p = 0.017) versus European patients, while ICU admission rates were higher in Latin American and North African versus European patients (OR (95%CI) 1.37 (1.17\u20131.60), p < 0.001) and (OR (95%CI) 1.74 (1.26\u20132.41), p < 0.001). Moreover, Latin American patients were 39% more likely than European patients to use IMV (OR (95%CI) 1.43 (1.21\u20131.71), p < 0.001). (4) Conclusion: The adjusted IHM was similar in all groups except for Sub-Saharan Africans, who had lower IHM. Latin American patients were admitted to the ICU and required IMV more often.\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E3390%2Fjcm11071949&urlhash=DCWN&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n-\n[Methylprednisolone Pulses in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients Without Respiratory Failure: A Randomized Controlled Trial](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E3389%2Ffmed%2E2022%2E807981&urlhash=Ka5n&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nFrontiers in Medicine\nAims: To assess the efficacy of methylprednisolone pulses (MPP) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with increased levels of inflammatory markers not requiring oxygen at baseline.\nMethods: Multicenter, parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Spain.

Patients admitted for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with raised inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein >60 mg/L, interleukin-6 >40 pg/ml, or ferritin >1,000 \u03bcg/L) but without respiratory failure after the first week of symptom onset were randomized to receive a 3-day course of intravenous MPP (120 mg/day) or placebo. The primary outcome was treatment failure at 14 days, a composite variable including mortality, the need for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation, and clinical worsening, this last parameter defined as a PaO2/FiO2 ratio below 300; or a 15% decrease in the PaO2 from baseline, together with an increase in inflammatory markers or radiological progression. If clinical worsening occurred, patients received tocilizumab and unmasked corticosteroids. The secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, adverse events, need for ICU admission or high-flow oxygen, length of hospital stay, SARS-CoV-2 clearance, and changes in laboratory parameters.\nResults: A total of 72 patients were randomized and 71 patients were analyzed (34 in the MPP group and 37 in the placebo group). Twenty patients presented with treatment failure (29.4 in the MPP group vs. 27.0% in the placebo group, p = 0.82), with no differences regarding the time to treatment failure between groups. There were no cases of death or mechanical ventilation requirements at 14 days post-randomization. The secondary outcomes were similar in MPP and placebo groups.\nConclusions: A 3-day course of MPP after the first week of disease onset did not prevent respiratory deterioration in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with an inflammatory phenotype who did not require oxygen.Otros autores\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E3389%2Ffmed%2E2022%2E807981&urlhash=Ka5n&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[Use of glucocorticoids megadoses in SARS-CoV-2 infection in a spanish registry: SEMI-COVID-19](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1371%2Fjournal%2Epone%2E0261711&urlhash=BBkL&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nPLOS One\nObjective\nTo describe the impact of different doses of corticosteroids on the evolution of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, based on the potential benefit of the non-genomic mechanism of these drugs at higher doses.\nMethods\nObservational study using data collected from the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry.

We evaluated the epidemiological, radiological and analytical scenario between patients treated with megadoses therapy of corticosteroids vs low-dose of corticosteroids and the development of complications. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality according to use of corticosteroids megadoses.\nResults\nOf a total of 14,921 patients, corticosteroids were used in 5,262 (35.3%). Of them, 2,216 (46%) specifically received megadoses. Age was a factor that differed between those who received megadoses therapy versus those who did not in a significant manner (69 years [IQR 59\u201379] vs 73 years [IQR 61\u201383]; p < .001). Radiological and analytical findings showed a higher use of megadoses therapy among patients with an interstitial infiltrate and elevated inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19. In the univariate study it appears that steroid use is associated with increased mortality (OR 2.07 95% CI 1.91\u20132.24 p < .001) and megadose use with increased survival (OR 0.84 95% CI 0.75\u20130.96, p 0.011), but when adjusting for possible confounding factors, it is observed that the use of megadoses is also associated with higher mortality (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.32\u20131.80; p < .001). There is no difference between megadoses and low-dose (p .298). Although, there are differences in the use of megadoses versus low-dose in terms of complications, mainly infectious, with fewer pneumonias and sepsis in the megadoses group (OR 0.82 95% CI 0.71\u20130.95; p < .001 and OR 0.80 95% CI 0.65\u20130.97; p < .001) respectively.\nConclusion\nThere is no difference in mortality with megadoses versus low-dose, but there is a lower incidence of infectious complications with glucocorticoid megadoses.\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1371%2Fjournal%2Epone%2E0261711&urlhash=BBkL&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[Serum CXCL13, BAFF, IL-21 and IL-22 levels are related to disease activity and lymphocyte profile in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E55563%2Fclinexprheumatol%2Ffp741f&urlhash=jWpS&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nClinical and Experimental Rheumatology\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the utility of serum BAFF, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21, IL-22, CXCL13, TNF-R2 and PD-L2 as biomarkers of disease activity in primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (pSS), their relationship with lymphocyte subpopulations and their accuracy to discriminate pSS from Sicca syndrome.\nMETHODS: We conducted an observational study on 66 pSS patients and 48 controls (25 with Sicca syndrome and 23 healthy volunteers).

Serum levels of BAFF, IL-17 A/F, IL-18, IL-21, IL-22, CXCL13, TNF-R2 and PD-L2 were measured using a multiplex immunoassay. Lymphocyte subpopulations were analysed by flow cytometry. Disease activity of pSS was assessed with ESSDAI at study inclusion.\nRESULTS: Patients with pSS presented higher serum CXCL13 (364.7 vs. 205.2 pg/mL), IL-21 (43.2 vs. 0 pg/mL) and BAFF (1646 vs. 1369 pg/mL), and lower PD-L2 levels (1950.8 vs. 2792.3 pg/mL) than controls. ESSDAI was associated with BAFF, IL-18 and IL-22. Patients with ESSDAI >0 exhibited higher CXCL13, IL-21, IL-22 and TNFR2 concentrations. IL-21 levels correlated with lower memory B-cell and higher na\u00efve B-cell percentages and IL-22 levels correlated with increased circulating activated CD4+ T-cells. The combination of serum CXCL13, BAFF and PDL2 levels using the formula [ln(CXCL13)+ln(BAFF)]/ln(PDL2) exhibit an AUC of 0.854 (95% CI: 0.750-0.919) to discriminate between pSS and Sicca syndrome (sensitivity 77.2% and specificity 86.4% using a cut-off of 1.7).\nCONCLUSIONS: CXCL13, BAFF, IL-21, and IL-22 are potential biomarkers of pSS activity and IL-21 and IL-22 are associated with disturbances of lymphocyte subpopulations in pSS. The combination of serum CXCL13, BAFF, and PD-L2 levels allows discrimination between pSS and Sicca syndrome.Otros autores\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E55563%2Fclinexprheumatol%2Ffp741f&urlhash=jWpS&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[Long-term impact of COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1016%2Fj%2Ejinf%2E2021%2E08%2E018&urlhash=Ye3a&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nJournal of Infection\nObjectives\nTo determine the health status, exercise capacity, and health related quality of life (HRQoL) of COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors, 8 months after diagnosis.\nMethods\nAll eligible patients were interviewed and underwent a physical examination, chest X-ray, and 6 min walk test (6MWT).

Five died after discharge and 48 were lost to follow-up. Of the 113 remaining patients, 81% had persistent symptoms. More than 50% of patients completed less than 80% of the theoretical distance on the 6MWT, 50% had an abnormal X-ray and 93% of patients developed psychiatric disorders. Mean SF-36 scores were worse than in the general population. After multivariate regression analysis, female sex, non-Caucasian race, and Charlson index>2 were independent risk factors for a worse mental health component summary score on the SF-36, and age was associated with a better prognosis. Female sex and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were independently associated with a worse physical component summary score.\nConclusion\nCOVID-19 associated ARDS survivors have long-term consequences in health status, exercise capacity, and HRQoL. Strategies addressed to prevent these sequelae are needed.Otros autores\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1016%2Fj%2Ejinf%2E2021%2E08%2E018&urlhash=Ye3a&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n-\n[Predicting critical illness on initial diagnosis of COVID-19 based on easily obtained clinical variables: development and validation of the PRIORITY model](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1016%2Fj%2Ecmi%2E2021%2E07%2E006&urlhash=SMTn&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nClinical Microbiology and Infection\nObjectives\nWe aimed to develop and validate a prediction model, based on clinical history and examination findings on initial diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to identify patients at risk of critical outcomes.\nMethods\nWe used data from the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, a cohort of consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from 132 centres in Spain (23rd March to 21st May 2020).

Multicenter nationwide cohort study in Spain. Patients included in the study were admitted to 147 hospitals from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Readmission was defined as a new hospital admission during the 30 days after discharge. Emergency department visits after discharge were not considered readmission. During the study period 8392 patients were admitted to hospitals participating in the SEMI-COVID-19 network. 298 patients (4.2%) out of 7137 patients were readmitted after being discharged. 1541 (17.7%) died during the index admission and 35 died during hospital readmission (11.7%, p = 0.007). The median time from discharge to readmission was 7 days (IQR 3\u201315 days).

Age [odds ratio (OR): 1.02; 95% confident interval (95% CI): 1.01\u20131.03], age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.06\u20131.21), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.26\u20132.69), asthma (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.04\u20132.22), hemoglobin level at admission (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86\u20130.99), ground-glass opacification at admission (OR: 0.86; 95% CI:0.76\u20130.98) and glucocorticoid treatment (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.00\u20131.66) were independently associated with hospital readmission. The rate of readmission after hospital discharge for COVID-19 was low. Advanced age and comorbidity were associated with increased risk of readmission.\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1038%2Fs41598-021-93076-0&urlhash=339t&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[Prone Position in COVID-19 Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Receiving Conventional Oxygen Therapy: A Retrospective Study](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1016%2Fj%2Earbres%2E2021%2E05%2E018&urlhash=-SR8&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nArchivos de Bronconeumolog\u00edaOtros autores\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1016%2Fj%2Earbres%2E2021%2E05%2E018&urlhash=-SR8&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[Risk Categories in COVID-19 Based on Degrees of Inflammation: Data on More Than 17,000 Patients from the Spanish SEMI-COVID-19 Registry](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E3390%2Fjcm10102214&urlhash=S2-L&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nJournal of Clinical Medicine\n(1) Background: [...] (2) Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, collected and followed-up from 1 March to 31 July 2020, from the nationwide Spanish SEMI-COVID-19 Registry.

Patients aged 20\u201365 years were selected. A multivariate logistic regression model was performed to identify factors associated with mortality.\nResults\nAs of 22 May 2020, 4393 patients were included, of whom 419 (9.5%) were HCW. Median (interquartile range) age of HCW was 52 (15) years and 62.4% were women. Prevalence of comorbidities and severe radiological findings upon admission were less frequent in HCW. There were no difference in need of respiratory support and admission to intensive care unit, but occurrence of sepsis and in-hospital mortality was lower in HCW (1.7% vs. 3.9%; p = 0.024 and 0.7% vs. 4.8%; p<0.001 respectively). Age, male sex and comorbidity, were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and healthcare working with lower mortality (OR 0.211, 95%CI 0.067\u20130.667, p = 0.008). 30-days survival was higher in HCW (0.968 vs. 0.851 p<0.001).\nConclusions\nHospitalized COVID-19 HCW had fewer comorbidities and a better prognosis than NHCW.

Mean age of patients was 66.6 years and 57.9% were males. The most common comorbidities were as follows: hypertension (49.2%), diabetes (18.8%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (12.8%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (34.7%) and acute kidney injury (13.9%) were the most common complications. In-hospital mortality was 20.9%. PSI and CURB-65 showed the highest AUROC (0.835 and 0.825, respectively). qSOFA and MuLBSTA had a lower AUROC (0.728 and 0.715, respectively). qSOFA was the most specific score (specificity 95.7%) albeit its sensitivity was only 26.2%.

This article aims to analyse the effect of blood cell depletion and blood cell recovery on mortality due to COVID-19. Design: This work was a retrospective, multicentre cohort study of 9644 hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 from the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine\u2019s SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. Setting: This study examined patients hospitalised in 147 hospitals throughout Spain. Participants: This work analysed 9644 patients (57.12% male) out of a cohort of 12,826 patients \u226518 years of age hospitalised with COVID-19 in Spain included in the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry as of 29 May 2020. Main outcome measures: The main outcome measure of this work is the effect of blood cell depletion and blood cell recovery on mortality due to COVID-19. Univariate analysis was performed to determine possible predictors of death, and then multivariate analysis was carried out to control for potential confounders. Results: An increase in the eosinophil count on the seventh day of hospitalisation was associated with a better prognosis, including lower mortality rates (5.2% vs. 22.6% in non-recoverers, OR 0.234; 95% CI, 0.154 to 0.354) and lower complication rates, especially regarding the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (8% vs. 20.1%, p = 0.000) and ICU admission (5.4% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.000). Lymphocyte recovery was found to have no effect on prognosis. Treatment with inhaled or systemic glucocorticoids was not found to be a confounding factor. Conclusion: Eosinophil recovery in patients with COVID-19 who required hospitalisation had an independent prognostic value for all-cause mortality and a milder course.\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E3390%2Fjcm10020305&urlhash=3Czv&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[Time-Course Changes of Serum Keratin Concentrations after Liver Transplantation: Contrasting Results of Keratin-18 and Keratin-19 Fragments](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1155%2F2020%2F8895435&urlhash=_MTR&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nCase Reports in Hepatology\nObjective.

Under normal conditions, adult hepatocytes express only keratin-8 (K8) and keratin-18 (K18), whereas cholangiocytes also express K19. In this study, we delineate the pattern of normal time-course changes in serum K19 and K18 levels after liver transplantation. Patients and Methods. Serum levels of the K19 fragment CYFRA 21-1 and the K18 fragments tissue polypeptide specific antigen (TPS) and M30 (a neoepitope that is generated after caspase cleavage during apoptosis) were measured at baseline and at regular intervals (up to 6 months) after liver transplantation in 11 adult patients. Results. There was a gradual decrease in serum K19 concentrations from baseline values after transplantation, following a time-course pattern similar to that of serum bilirubin. In contrast, serum concentrations of K18 fragments increased markedly shortly after transplantation and gradually decreased thereafter, following a time-course pattern similar to that of serum transaminases. The increase in TPS tended to occur earlier than that in M30, suggesting an initial predominance of hepatocyte necrosis followed by a predominance of apoptosis in the first days after transplantation. Five patients presented posttransplant complications (acute rejection in three cases and HCV recurrence in two cases). An early increase in serum K19 concentrations was observed in all cases. An increase in serum concentrations of K18 fragments (M30 and TPS) was observed in the two cases with HCV recurrence and was more variable in the three cases with acute rejection. Conclusions. Serum concentrations of K19 and K18 fragments follow a dissimilar pattern of time-course changes after liver transplantation. The diagnostic value of variations in these normal patterns should be addressed in future studies.\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1155%2F2020%2F8895435&urlhash=_MTR&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[Predicting Clinical Outcome with Phenotypic Clusters in COVID-19 Pneumonia: An Analysis of 12,066 Hospitalized Patients from the Spanish Registry SEMI-COVID-19](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E3390%2Fjcm9113488&urlhash=8nm3&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nJournal of Clinical Medicine\n(1) Background: Different clinical presentations in COVID-19 are described to date, from mild to severe cases.

Data on the effectiveness of non-intravenous carbapenem-sparing antibiotic options are limited. This study compared the 30-day mortality and clinical failure associated with the use of carbapenems versus alternative non-intravenous antibiotics for the definitive treatment of ESBL/AmpC-positive Enterobacteriaceae bacteraemia. This 12-year retrospective study (2004\u20132015) included all patients with bacteraemia due to ESBL/AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae at a Spanish hospital. Given the lack of randomisation of initial therapies, a propensity score for receiving carbapenems was calculated. There were 1115 patients with a first episode of bacteraemia due to Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, of which 123 (11.0%) were ESBL/AmpC-positive. There were 101 eligible patients: 59 in the carbapenem group and 42 in the alternative treatment group (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 59.5%, quinolones 21.4%). The most frequent sources of infection were urinary (63%) and biliary (15%). Compared with the carbapenem group, patients treated with an alternative regimen had a shorter hospital stay [median (IQR) 7 (5\u201310) days vs. 12 (9\u201318) days; P < 0.001]. Use of an alternative non-intravenous therapy did not increase mortality (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.05\u20131.61; P = 0.15). After controlling for confounding factors with the propensity score, the adjusted OR of carbapenem treatment was 4.95 (95% CI 0.94\u201326.01; P = 0.059). Alternative non-intravenous carbapenem-sparing antibiotics could have a role in the definitive treatment of ESBL/AmpC-positive Enterobacteriaceae bacteraemia, allowing a reduction in carbapenem use. Use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in this series showed favourable results.Otros autores\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1016%2Fj%2Eijantimicag%2E2019%2E05%2E004&urlhash=OJau&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[Risk of ischaemic events at giant cell arteritis diagnosis according to PET/CT findings](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1007%2Fs00259-019-04339-y&urlhash=YjBU&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nEuropean Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging\nPurpose\nTo analyse the risk of ischaemic events in patients with newly diagnosed giant cell arteritis (GCA) according to PET/CT findings.\nMethods\nPET/CT was performed during the first 10 days of steroid therapy.

Clinical manifestations at diagnosis, and physical examination and PET/CT findings were recorded and compared according to the presence or absence of ischaemic symptoms at disease onset. Analysed territories included the ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending aorta, abdominal aorta, carotid arteries, brachiocephalic trunk, vertebral arteries, subclavian arteries and axillary arteries.\nResults\nThe study group comprised 30 patients with a median age of 80.8 years. Of these patients, 21 (70%) reported ischaemic symptoms at diagnosis, and 13 (43.3%) had permanent visual loss. Of the 30 patients, 77.8% showed large vessel vasculitis (including aortic and vertebral artery involvement) on PET/CT, and 60% had isolated involvement of the vertebral territory. Vertebral arteries were more frequently involved in patients with ischaemic symptoms (OR 5.0, 95% CI 0.99\u201324.86, p = 0.051). The presence of vertebral artery involvement in the absence of aortic involvement was associated with the presence of ischaemic manifestations (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p = 0.001). The presence of aortitis was found to protect against the development of permanent visual loss (OR 19.0, 95% CI 2.79\u2013127.97, p = 0.001).\nConclusion\nOur findings suggest an association between the vascular pattern on PET/CT at the time of GCA diagnosis and the risk of ischaemic events.Otros autores\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1007%2Fs00259-019-04339-y&urlhash=YjBU&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[Health-Care Associated Mycobacterium bovis-BCG Infection in Cancer Patients without prior BCG Instillation](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1093%2Fcid%2Fcix496&urlhash=fxYe&trk=public_profile_publication-title)\nClinical Infectious Diseases\nBackground: Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, is widely used as adjunctive therapy for superficial bladder cancer.

Intravesical administration of BCG has been associated with systemic infection. Disseminated infection due to M. bovis is otherwise uncommon.\nMethods: After identification of 3 patients with healthcare-associated BCG infection who had never received intravesical BCG administration, an epidemiologic study was performed. All patients with healthcare-associated BCG infection in the Barcelona tuberculosis (TB) program were reviewed from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2015, searching for infections caused by M. bovis-BCG. Patients with healthcare-associated BCG infection who had not received intravesical BCG instillation were selected and the source of infection was investigated.\nResults: Nine oncology patients with infection caused by M. bovis-BCG were studied. All had permanent central venous catheters. Catheter maintenance was performed at 4 different outpatient clinics in the same room in which other patients underwent BCG instillations for bladder cancer without required biological precautions. All patients developed pulmonary TB, either alone or with extrapulmonary disease. Catheter-related infection was considered the mechanism of acquisition based on the epidemiologic association and positive catheter cultures for BCG in patients in whom mycobacterial cultures were performed.\nConclusions: Physicians should be alerted to the possibility of TB due to nosocomially acquired, catheter-related infections with M. bovis-BCG in patients with indwelling catheters. This problem may be more common than expected in centers providing BCG therapy for bladder cancer without adequate precautions.Otros autores\n[Ver publicaci\u00f3n](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi%2Eorg%2F10%2E1093%2Fcid%2Fcix496&urlhash=fxYe&trk=public_profile_publication-button)\n-\n[Endocarditis infecciosa en adultos con cardiopat\u00eda cong\u00e9nita.
