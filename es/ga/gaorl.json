It is estimated that between 50% and 80% of menopausal women experience hot flashes11 Morrow PK, Mattair DN, Hortobagyi GN. Hot flashes: a review of pathophysiology and treatment modalities. Oncologist. 2011;16(11):1658-64., and these ratios may vary from 64% to 85% in women with breast cancer22. Chandwani KD, Heckler CE, Mohile SG, Mustian KM, Janelsins M, Peppone LJ, et al.

The intensity and duration of hot flash episodes in women vary, and hot flashes generally lead to reduced quality of life because they cause physical discomfort and irritability, disturb sleep, and can lead to depression11 Morrow PK, Mattair DN, Hortobagyi GN.

It aims to relieve symptoms via the reorganization of the body's energy, with the goal of self-cure1818. Kurebayashi LFS, Freitas GF, Oguisso T.

In the past, the lack of an adequate simulated procedure (sham treatment) led researchers to compare real acupuncture with a wide range of interventions2222. NIH Consensus Conference. Acupuncture.

Although a systematic review performed in 20091010. Lee MS, Kim KH, Choi SM, Ernst E. Acupuncture for treating hot flashes in breast cancer patients: a systematic review. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2009;115(3):497-503. evaluated the efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment option for hot flashes in patients with breast cancer, the main focus of this review was not specifically to compare TCA to SA. Instead, the authors reviewed many clinical trials comparing TCA with various types of treatment, including SA; active treatments, such as hormone therapy, relaxation, and antidepressants; and no treatment. The authors concluded that the evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for the relief of hot flashes in patients with breast cancer was not convincing, mainly because of systematic errors in the studies reviewed.\nThe authors hypothesized that the fact that TCA did not produce statistically superior results compared with SA, regardless of the technique used, was because the TCA was either ineffective or was not administered correctly or because SA is also an effective treatment. From this perspective, we sought to update and present the state of the art on this particular issue, as SA has been a reliable method showing promising results for some morbidities2525.

Acta Medica Mediterranea. 2013;29:167..\nThe rationale for the present study is based on the high prevalence of hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer. This symptom is associated with a worse prognosis11 Morrow PK, Mattair DN, Hortobagyi GN. Hot flashes: a review of pathophysiology and treatment modalities. Oncologist. 2011;16(11):1658-64.\n2.

Menopause. 2012;19(3):257-71., including a low survival rate, reduced adherence to treatment, and diminished overall quality of life. Thus, managing this symptom is an important aspect of nursing practice in oncology. Assessing and treating symptoms related to cancer in terms of patient survival, adherence to treatment, and quality of life during and after treatment is currently among the research pillars of clinical oncology and is a priority in oncology nursing research2727. Oncology Nursing Society. Oncology Clinical Trials Nurse Competencies [Internet]. 2010. [Acesso 3 out 2014]. Dispon\u00edvel em: http://www.ons.org/media/ons/docs/publications/ctncompetencies.pdf.\n[http://www.ons.org/media/ons/docs/public...\n](http://www.ons.org/media/ons/docs/publications/ctncompetencies.pdf). Given the importance of the subject, the aim of the present study was to identify and synthesize evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials that tested the effectiveness of TCA in relation to SA for the treatment of hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer.\nWe believe that grouping, updating, and synthesizing the available evidence on this subject can not only guide further research but also support health professionals' decisions regarding the use of complementary therapies for cancer patients. The goal is to enable the safe and evidence-based use of these therapies to demystify them.\nMethod\nThe study is a systematic review of the literature, guided by recommendations from the Cochrane Collaboration2828. Higgins JPT, Green S, editors. Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.0.2 [atualizado set 2009]. [Internet]. The Cochrane Collaboration; 2009. [Acesso 3 out 2014]. Dispon\u00edvel em: http//:www.cochrane-handbook.org\n[http//:www.cochrane-handbook.org...\n](http//:www.cochrane-handbook.org). The question of the systematic review, which was based on the patient, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO)2929. Costa Santos CM, Mattos Pimenta CA, Nobre MR. The PICO strategy for the research question construction and evidence search. Rev. Latino-Am. Enfermagem. 2007;15(3):508-11.) strategy, was \"Is traditional Chinese acupuncture more effective than sham acupuncture for the relief of hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer?\"\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized clinical trials (RCT) published in full up to the present time (July 2014) in English, Portuguese, or Spanish that included adult women (\u226518 years old) with breast cancer and in menopause experiencing hot flashes and that analyzed the effectiveness of traditional Chinese versus sham acupuncture to treat this vasomotor symptom. Studies conducted with animals and publications such as literature reviews, dissertations, theses, editorials, and clinical guidelines were excluded.\nSearch strategy\nWe searched five electronic databases: the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online via PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Database (CENTRAL), the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean (LILACS). The search strategy considered search terms related to the study population (P), intervention (I), comparison with placebo (C), outcome (O), and study design (RCT). We selected keywords from the controlled vocabularies of each database as well as non-controlled keywords, which were combined within each term set with the Boolean connectors AND and OR. The main keywords adopted in the search strategy for the primary studies were Breast Neoplasm, Acupuncture, Acupuncture Therapy, Acupuncture Points, Placebos, Sham Treatment, Hot Flashes, Hot Flushes, Menopause, Climacteric, Vasomotor Symptoms, and Vasomotor Symptoms Menopause, combined with the Boolean operators AND and OR. To locate the RCTs, we added a filter after the PICO search strategy that included the following terms: AND Clinical Trial OR Controlled Clinical Trial OR Randomized Controlled Trial. The search was performed at the end of July 2014, and 272 publications were initially found.\nStudy selection\nTo select the studies, two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the identified publications. In cases of doubt or disagreement, a third reviewer was asked to decide whether to include the study. The agreement rate between the reviewers was 96%.\nMethodological quality appraisal of the included studies\nFor the methodological quality appraisal of the included studies, we used the Jadad scale3030. Jadad AR, Moore RA, Carroll D, Jenkinson C, Reynolds DJ, Gavaghan DJ, et al. Assessing the quality of reports of randomized clinical trials: is blinding necessary? Control Clin Trials. 1996;17(1):1-12., which allows a classification of the quality of the evidence from RCTs and has been described in the literature as a reliable and widely used tool to appraise the quality of clinical trials. This scale appraises and scores five specific topics: 1. Was the study described as randomized?, 2. Was the randomization procedure appropriate?, 3. Was the study described as double-blinded?, 4. Was the concealment method appropriate? and 5. Was there a description of the exclusion criteria and the drop-out rate?. The final score of the Jadad scale ranges from 0 to 5. Studies that score < 3 are classified as low quality, and studies that score \u2265 3 are classified as high quality3030. Jadad AR, Moore RA, Carroll D, Jenkinson C, Reynolds DJ, Gavaghan DJ, et al. Assessing the quality of reports of randomized clinical trials: is blinding necessary? Control Clin Trials. 1996;17(1):1-12..\nThe studies were also appraised regarding the risk of bias, considering random sequence generation; the allocation concealment; the blinding of subjects, health care providers, and outcome evaluators; incomplete outcome data; selective reporting; and other sources of bias2828. Higgins JPT, Green S, editors. Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.0.2 [atualizado set 2009]. [Internet]. The Cochrane Collaboration; 2009. [Acesso 3 out 2014].

Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 [atualizado mar\u00e7o 2011]. [Internet]. The Cochrane Collaboration; 2011. [Acesso 3 out 2014]. Dispon\u00edvel em: http//:www.cochrane-handbook.org. [http//:www.cochrane-handbook.org...\n](http//:www.cochrane-handbook.org). Studies with a low risk of bias are considered unlikely to have serious problems with the reliability of their results. An uncertain risk of bias raises questions regarding the reliability of the study results, and a high risk of bias seriously weaknesses the reliability of the results3131. Higgins JPT, Green S, editors. Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 [atualizado mar\u00e7o 2011]. [Internet]. The Cochrane Collaboration; 2011. [Acesso 3 out 2014]. Dispon\u00edvel em: http//:www.cochrane-handbook.org. [http//:www.cochrane-handbook.org...\n](http//:www.cochrane-handbook.org).\nData extraction and analysis\nFor data extraction, we used a form that was designed for the present study, which considered the instructions provided by the Cochrane Collaboration2828. Higgins JPT, Green S, editors. Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.0.2 [atualizado set 2009]. [Internet]. The Cochrane Collaboration; 2009. [Acesso 3 out 2014]. Dispon\u00edvel em: http//:www.cochrane-handbook.org\n[http//:www.cochrane-handbook.org...\n](http//:www.cochrane-handbook.org)) regarding content and structure. This pre-defined form included the following information: study identification (title, journal, publication year, volume, number, and authors), objectives, and method (randomization method, concealment, number of patients randomized, description of loss to follow-up rates, inclusion and exclusion criteria, measurement of hot flashes and clinical characteristics, intervention in the experimental and control groups, data analysis, and outcomes). The data were extracted from each study by two independent reviewers. Next, all of the selected studies were distributed among three reviewers, who appraised the methodological quality of each trial using the Jadad scale3030. Jadad AR, Moore RA, Carroll D, Jenkinson C, Reynolds DJ, Gavaghan DJ, et al. Assessing the quality of reports of randomized clinical trials: is blinding necessary? Control Clin Trials. 1996;17(1):1-12.. The data extracted from the studies included in this review were analyzed according to their outcomes, and the results are presented in descriptive form.\nResults\nA total of 272 studies were retrieved from the five databases selected for this study: 205 from CINAHL, 31 from CENTRAL, 29 from Web of Science, 7 from MEDLINE via PubMed, and zero from LILACS. Of these, 242 studies were preselected. After analysis and with 100% agreement among reviewers, only 5 manuscripts met all of the eligibility criteria and answered the proposed research question.\n[Figure 1]() shows the flowchart of the selection process for the studies that were included in the present review. The opinion of a third reviewer was requested to obtain consensus on the quality appraisal of the five selected articles.\nAmong the included studies, one was conducted in Norway3232.

Randomized, controlled trial of acupuncture for the treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer patients. J Clin Oncol. 2007;25(35):5584-90., the needles used in the TCA group were filiform, made of stainless steel, and measured 0.20 x 30 mm (manufactured by SeirinCorp - Shizuoka, Japan). The needles were inserted 0.25 to 0.5 inches into the skin. The acupuncture points were designed and manually manipulated to obtain Qi (vital energy that flows in the meridians), and no electrical stimulus or other interventions were applied. In the SA group, 0.30 \u00d7 30 mm Streitberger needles (Asiamed, Pullach, Germany) were used. The needles were applied a few centimeters away from the TCA points (DU14, GB20, BL13, PC7, H6, K7, ST36, and SP6). Rather than penetrating the skin, the needle was retracted after insertion through adhesive tape, which was placed over a supporting plastic ring. This type of fake needle has high reliability and has been used with success in RCTs. The frequency and duration of the intervention in both groups was identical.\nIn study 23232. Hervik J, Mj\u00e5land O. Acupuncture for the treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer patients, a randomized, controlled trial. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2009;116(2):311-6., the TCA group was treated with disposable 0.3-mm needles inserted from 0.5 to 3.0 cm into the skin. Eight unilateral acupuncture points were used along the TCA meridians (used for cooling the body, toning the yin, and reducing excess heat). The designated acupuncture points were manually manipulated to obtain De Qi, which is numbness, distension, or electrical tingling sensation at the needle insertion sites that may radiate along the corresponding meridian. The target acupuncture points in study 2 were highly innervated areas: LIV3, GB20, LU7, KI3, SP6, REN4, P7, and LIV8. In the SA group, the needles were inserted 2- to 3-mm deep at eight points (four bilateral points) far from the TCA points.\nIn study 33333.

Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2012;135(3):791-8., the TCA group was treated with eight sterile, disposable, 0.25 \u00d7 40-mm needles (Dongbang Acupuncture, Inc.). The needles were inserted to a depth of 5 to 20 mm at defined points until the De Qi threshold was reached. After 10 minutes, the needles were slightly rotated without evoking the needle sensation. The manually manipulated points were Li4, HT6, LR3, and ST36 unilaterally and Sp6 and Ki7 bilaterally. In the SA group, the sham needles were applied 1 cm away from the traditional TCA points without being inserted into a meridian or a different point and without penetrating the skin.\nIn study 43434. Bokmand S, Flyger H. Acupuncture relieves menopausal discomfort in breast cancer patients: a prospective, double blinded, randomized study. Breast. 2013;22(3):320-3., the TCA patients received manual manipulation bilaterally for 15-20 minutes at points pre-determined by traditional Chinese medicine. Real points were used along the acupuncture meridians (HC6, KI3, Sp6, and Lr3). The SA group received sham acupuncture at four non-bilateral pre-determined points that were outside the established TCA meridians but in the same region as the real points. The SA intervention used the same type of needles used in the TCA group, but the needles were inserted superficially (1 cm into the skin). This study also included a third group that received no intervention for the purpose of comparison. In study 53535. Bao T, Cai L, Snyder C, Betts K, Tarpinian K, Gould J, et al.

Acupuncture relieves menopausal discomfort in breast cancer patients: a prospective, double blinded, randomized study. Breast. 2013;22(3):320-3..\nIn summary, three studies suggested that TCA is more effective than SA (\n[Figure 2]()). Study 188. Deng G, Vickers A, Yeung S, D'Andrea GM, Xiao H, Heerdt AS, et al. Randomized, controlled trial of acupuncture for the treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer patients. J Clin Oncol. 2007;25(35):5584-90. demonstrated that the group receiving TCA experienced 0.8 fewer hot flashes per day than the placebo group receiving SA. However, this association was not statistically significant (CI95%= - 0.7 to 2.4; p = 0.30). The results from study 23232. Hervik J, Mj\u00e5land O. Acupuncture for the treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer patients, a randomized, controlled trial. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2009;116(2):311-6.) showed that the number of hot flashes was reduced by 50% (p <0.001) in the group of women receiving TCA, representing an average of 9.5 hot flashes (SD = 4.9) that decreased to 4.7 hot flashes (SD=3.7) during treatment with TCA. No significant change was observed in the group that received SA either during treatment (p = 0.382) or after the 12-week follow-up (p=0.86). In this same study, the difference in response between the TCA group and the SA group was significant during both the treatment and the 12-week follow-up period (p < 0.001).\nStudy 43434. Bokmand S, Flyger H. Acupuncture relieves menopausal discomfort in breast cancer patients: a prospective, double blinded, randomized study. Breast. 2013;22(3):320-3. found significant associations among the three groups (G1- TCA; G2- SA; G3- no intervention). There was a significant improvement among the women who underwent TCA after one week of treatment, and the effects persisted up to 12 weeks after the last session. The differences were significant between the groups G1 and G2 and between G1 and G3 after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment (\n[Figure 2]()).\nThe other two trials (Studies 3 and 5) found that both interventions (TCA and SA) were beneficial in the treatment of hot flashes. However, the differences between the groups in these studies were not significant (p > 0.05)3333. Liljegren A, Gunnarsson P, Landgren BM, Rob\u00e9us N, Johansson H, Rotstein S.

Cancer. 2014;120(3):381-9..\n[Figure 3]() presents the risk of bias analysis for the selected studies.\nRegarding the risk of bias in the selected studies, it was observed that the reliability of the results can be questioned in all studies because of both uncertain risk of bias and high risk of bias. Uncertain risk of bias was prominent in the following areas: blinding of outcome evaluators (60%), incomplete outcome data (60%), other sources of bias (60%), and selective reporting (40%). High risk of bias was present in the following areas: random sequence generation (20%), allocation concealment (20%), blinding of subjects and health care providers (20%), and blinding of outcome evaluators (20%). In general, the areas where low risk of bias was prevalent were allocation concealment (80%), blinding of subjects and health care providers (80%), and random sequence generation (60%).\nDiscussion\nBased on the interventions used and the outcomes of the reviewed studies, we observed that acupuncture acts as a complementary therapy to conventional treatment for the control of hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer.\nIn the present review, three studies demonstrated that compared with SA, TCA was more effective for reducing the frequency and intensity of hot flashes(88. Deng G, Vickers A, Yeung S, D'Andrea GM, Xiao H, Heerdt AS, et al. Randomized, controlled trial of acupuncture for the treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer patients. J Clin Oncol. 2007;25(35):5584-90.,3232. Hervik J, Mj\u00e5land O. Acupuncture for the treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer patients, a randomized, controlled trial. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2009;116(2):311-6.,3434. Bokmand S, Flyger H. Acupuncture relieves menopausal discomfort in breast cancer patients: a prospective, double blinded, randomized study. Breast. 2013;22(3):320-3.). Other studies corroborate these findings, such as a pilot study conducted in South Korea that provided 12 TCA sessions for 10 post-menopausal women with breast cancer undergoing hormonal treatment with tamoxifen(r) or anastrozole(r). That study showed that the frequency of hot flashes was reduced from 9.3 to 1.5 daily episodes (p = 0.007) at the end of the treatment and that the intensity (measured using a VAS from 0 to 10) varied from 2.8 to 1.1 (p = 0.001), suggesting the effectiveness of TCA(3636. Jeong YJ, Park YS, Kwon HJ, Shin IH, Bong JG, Park SH. Acupuncture for the treatment of hot flashes in patients with breast cancer receiving antiestrogen therapy: a pilot study in Korean women. J Altern Complement Med. 2013;19(8):690-6.).\nAnother study(3737. Borud E, Grimsgaard S, White A. Menopausal problems and acupuncture. Auton Neurosci. 2010;157(1-2):57-62.) examined the evidence supporting the effectiveness of TCA for hot flashes induced by menopause and found that TCA is an effective complementary therapy for reducing such symptoms. The same study noted that TCA may affect the release of serotonin and beta-endorphins in the central nervous system, therefore influencing and stabilizing the thermoregulatory center, normalizing body temperature, and reducing hot flashes and sweating(3737. Borud E, Grimsgaard S, White A. Menopausal problems and acupuncture. Auton Neurosci. 2010;157(1-2):57-62.). A systematic review conducted in 2011 presented a hypothesis for the emergence of hot flashes: dysfunction of the thermoregulation core, which keeps the body temperature within normal parameters (homeostasis). Women with complaints of hot flashes may have an alteration in this thermoregulation zone, which may be intensified by low levels of body estrogen that lead to dysregulated levels of noradrenaline and serotonin, which are involved in temperature regulation. This review reinforces suggestions that TCA may influence the release of serotonin and is a therapeutic modality for the relief of hot flashes(11 Morrow PK, Mattair DN, Hortobagyi GN. Hot flashes: a review of pathophysiology and treatment modalities. Oncologist. 2011;16(11):1658-64.).\nA recent review of the literature reported evidence that TCA improves immune function via the modulation of natural killer (NK) cell activity. A hypothetical model has been proposed to explain how TCA stimulates the immune system by stimulating the acupoint ST36. This point is also known as \"immune enhancement acupoint\" for its ability to improve immune system functioning. Stimulation of this acupoint induces the release of nitric oxide, a neurotransmitter that stimulates the lateral area of the hypothalamus via sensory nerves and promotes the secretion of opioid peptides, such as \u03b2-endorphin. This peptide reaches the spleen and other body areas through blood circulation, binding to the opioid receptors expressed on the surface of NK cells. By binding to these receptors, \u03b2-endorphin stimulates NK cells to increase the expression of cytotoxic molecules, which increases tumoricidal activity and, consequently, the production of IFN-\u03b3. This cytokine induces the expression of NK cell receptors and possibly the secretion of cytokines from other immune system cells, orchestrating and amplifying anticancer immune functions(3838. Johnston MF, Ortiz S\u00e1nchez E, Vujanovic NL, Li W. Acupuncture May Stimulate Anticancer Immunity via Activation of Natural Killer Cells. Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2011;3(10):1-14.).\nIn addition to promoting relief from hot flashes, TCA has been shown to be effective in relieving other symptoms in women with breast cancer. A study in the United States examined 51 women with breast cancer to evaluate the benefits of TCA for improving pain, stiffness, and functional capacity in women with arthralgia induced by treatment with aromatase inhibitors. The study compared TCA with SA and found that TCA was more effective than SA for reducing pain (p<0.001). The group undergoing TCA had a significantly (p = 0.003) lower mean pain intensity score (2.6) compared with the group undergoing SA (4.5) after six weeks of intervention(1919. Crew KD, Capodice JL, Greenlee H, Brafman L, Fuentes D, Awad D, et al. Randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial of acupuncture for the management of aromatase inhibitor-associated joint symptoms in women with early-stage breast cancer. J Clin Oncol. 2010;28(7):1154-60.).\nTwo other studies included in the present systematic review suggest that both interventions, i.e., TCA and SA, are beneficial for the treatment of hot flashes because there was a reduction in symptoms, even though there were no significant differences between the two intervention methods(3333. Liljegren A, Gunnarsson P, Landgren BM, Rob\u00e9us N, Johansson H, Rotstein S. Reducing vasomotor symptoms with acupuncture in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen: a randomized controlled trial. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2012;135(3):791-8.,3535. Bao T, Cai L, Snyder C, Betts K, Tarpinian K, Gould J, et al. Patient-reported outcomes in women with breast cancer enrolled in a dual-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of acupuncture in reducing aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal symptoms. Cancer. 2014;120(3):381-9.). However, studies suggest that there is controversy regarding the use of SA because the similarity between the results of TCA and SA may arise because the patient's expectations regarding the intervention influence its effects, or it could be related to the different administration protocols used. This is a crucial aspect of clinical research that requires rigorous evaluation, with protocols based on clinical guidelines(3939. Appleyard I, Lundeberg T, Robinson N. Should systematic reviews assess the risk of bias from sham-placebo acupuncture control procedures? European Journal of Integrative Medicine. 2014;6(2):234-43.-4040. White P, Bishop FL, Prescott P, Scott C, Little P, Lewith G. Practice, practitioner, or placebo? A multifactorial, mixed-methods randomized controlled trial of acupuncture. Pain. 2012;153(2):455-62.).\nOne study(4141. Zheng YC, Yuan TT, Liu T. Is acupuncture a placebo therapy? Complement Ther Med. 2014;22(4):724-30.)noted that TCA and SA are integral parts of health care and can have positive impacts on treatment outcomes. It also stated that the placebo effect of SA may be relevant because of various non-specific contextual factors that can arise during each treatment session(4141. Zheng YC, Yuan TT, Liu T. Is acupuncture a placebo therapy? Complement Ther Med. 2014;22(4):724-30.). This premise is also supported by another study(4242. Azad A, John T. Do randomized acupuncture studies in patients with cancer need a sham acupuncture control arm? J Clin Oncol. 2013;31(16):2057-8.) that suggests that acupuncture therapy (both TCA and SA) involves an interpersonal and empathic relationship between the therapist and the patient, including stimulating verbal and non-verbal communication. The study also highlights the importance of the SA group in randomized trials, which should have study groups must be allocated identically except for the intervention under investigation because other differences could interfere with the study results(4242. Azad A, John T. Do randomized acupuncture studies in patients with cancer need a sham acupuncture control arm? J Clin Oncol. 2013;31(16):2057-8.).\nRegarding the methods used to measure hot flashes, we found that most studies used diaries as a resource for recording the frequency and intensity of hot flashes. A study conducted to examine the methodological issues of hot flash assessments raised the importance of the validity and reliability of the measurement instruments(4343. Sloan JA, Loprinzi CL, Novotny PJ, Barton DL, Lavasseur BI, Windschitl H. Methodologic lessons learned from hot flash studies. J Clin Oncol. 2001;19(23):4280-90.). Regarding validity, the authors called for analyzing data pertaining to quality of life, treatment toxicity (appetite loss, nausea, insomnia), behavioral habits (physical activity) and treatment progression to eliminate measurement and confounding biases. One source of reliability is the use of a control group to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention(4343. Sloan JA, Loprinzi CL, Novotny PJ, Barton DL, Lavasseur BI, Windschitl H. Methodologic lessons learned from hot flash studies. J Clin Oncol. 2001;19(23):4280-90.). In the present review, we found that only one study(3535. Bao T, Cai L, Snyder C, Betts K, Tarpinian K, Gould J, et al. Patient-reported outcomes in women with breast cancer enrolled in a dual-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of acupuncture in reducing aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal symptoms. Cancer. 2014;120(3):381-9.) evaluated other symptoms (such as quality of life, sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, and symptoms of menopause) via validated scales with high reliability to diminish measurement and confounding biases.\nRegarding the long-term effects of TCA, a systematic review that aimed to assess these effects on the relief of hot flashes in women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer after oncologic treatment showed that these effects lasted up to three months after the intervention with TCA. After treatment with TCA (from 5 to 12 weeks), an average reduction of 43.2% (general reduction for both men and women) in vasomotor symptoms was observed; and after three months, the reduction was maintained at 45.6%, demonstrating ongoing effectiveness after the end of the intervention(4444. Frisk JW, Hammar ML, Ingvar M, Spetz Holm AC. How long do the effects of acupuncture on hot flashes persist in cancer patients? Support Care Cancer. 2014;22(5):1409-15.).\nAnother study(4545. Hervik JA, Mj\u00e5land OB. Long term follow up of breast cancer patients treated with acupuncture for hot flashes. Springer Plus. 2014;3(1):1-6.) followed 61 women with breast cancer two years after the end of treatment with TCA and SA and identified that the effect of the intervention was sustained in the TCA group compared with the SA group. However, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. The authors also claimed that acupuncture may influence the thermoregulatory system by stimulating long-term neurotransmitters, thus providing an effective and safe alternative for treating hot flashes associated with menopause when performed by a qualified and competent professional(4545. Hervik JA, Mj\u00e5land OB. Long term follow up of breast cancer patients treated with acupuncture for hot flashes. Springer Plus. 2014;3(1):1-6.).\nStudy limitations\nMost of the included studies had small sample sizes, were not representative of the population, and did not report on the sample size calculation, which may have compromised their ability to detect significant differences between the two interventions in relieving hot flashes. Thus, to minimize type I and type II errors and to increase the accuracy of the results, we suggest conducting new clinical trials with adequate sample sizes. In addition, most of studies did not report the loss of participants, especially in terms of follow up, which led to selection bias in these studies. Furthermore, the short follow-up time (4 to 12 weeks) may have affected the measurement of some outcomes. Therefore, we suggest that new RCTs be conducted with longer follow-up times. In addition to methodological limitations, the risk of bias found in the selected studies reduces the reliability of the findings, demonstrating the need for further large-scale studies with representative samples and a low risk of bias.\nConclusions\nThe results of this systematic review provide the following evidence regarding the effectiveness of TCA versus SA for the treatment/relief of hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer:\n- There is no sufficient evidence to affirm the effectiveness of TCA compared with SA for the treatment of hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer;\n- It is possible to consider a slight superiority in the effectiveness of TCA compared with SA based on the studies reviewed. However, other well-designed clinical trials with long-term follow-up are needed to confirm this hypothesis; the groups undergoing both interventions should have a follow-up longer than 12 weeks to verify the long-term outcomes.\nReferences\n-\n1Morrow PK, Mattair DN, Hortobagyi GN.
