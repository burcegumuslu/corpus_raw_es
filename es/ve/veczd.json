Spain. cmarta@unizar.es \tTimes of emotions and infodemics En tiempos de infodemia y emociones \t\tDuring the period in which this issue has been forged, we have witnessed a truly shocking and Dantesque world scene. COVID 19 has come to confine humanity for several weeks in their homes, as a safeguard to prevent transmission. Meanwhile, MJC was receiving a large number of articles, targeted for both the monographs and the miscellaneous part of the journal. Our excellent current situation in the ranking of the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (FECYT) and the excellent positioning in many other databases and evaluation systems, make many authors who bet on MJC as a scientific reference for their articles. When two years ago we proposed the monographic topics for this semester, the news that would frighten the world was still far away: the spread of a pandemic with an unexpected projection that keeps the planet on edge. It is also curious that just in this issue two recently updated issues derived from the health crisis are combined. On the one hand, the fake news, with so much repercussion on the quality and credibility of the media, and on the other, the emotions in public controversies and the structural tragedy that occurred. In the call for papers of these two monographs, we already announced, on the one hand, that \"trust in information is, today more than ever, at the center of the debate on the social effects of media news\" and on the other, that \u201cit is interesting to delve into how emotions guide the emergence or blockage of public affairs; as they affect the development and resolution of mediated controversies; How they determine the construction of publics and communities or how they influence the forms of participation with regard to communication practices \u201d. The truth is that, during these months, happens to have come together both infodemic and emotions, in such a priority way in the media agendas. Firstly, we present the monograph entitled \"Fake news and impact on the credibility of the media\", made up of seven articles and coordinated by three leading experts on this topic: Pedro Farias Batlle (University of Malaga, Spain); Dolores Rodr\u00edguez Barba (Universidad Complutense of Madrid, Spain) and Jacob L. Nelson (University of Northwestern, USA). The hoaxes, disinformation, threats to the quality of information and the loss of credibility of citizens in the media, are some of the topics presented in the different contributions that this issue contains. The second monograph is entitled \"Emotions and discourses in public controversies\", and coordinated by Vanesa Saiz-Echezarreta, from the University of Castilla-La Mancha, in Cuenca, Spain, and Paulina G\u00f3mez-Lorenzini, from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, researchers specialized in the subject matter of the study. This issue contains a total of six articles, where there are different proposals loaded with news milestones that sparked controversy. Regarding the Miscellany section, as its name suggests, very diverse topics come together with its subsequent investigations and case studies. This issue starts with the contribution entitled \"The new persuasive advertising strategies by induction of levels of psychological processing\" by Jes\u00fas Bermejo Berros, from the University of Valladolid (Spain). The article warns that media saturation has had an impact on advertising effectiveness, and its strategies have needed to be renewed to be more effective, through new channels and interactivity. As the main contribution, it includes a model of Advertising Message Processing Levels. Continuing in the advertising field, the following contribution is entitled \"Analysis of the effectiveness of advertising content of influencers in minors through neuromarketing\". The authors are Marina Ferrer L\u00f3pez, \n 6 from the University Complutense of Madrid. The new advertising formats through influencers channels is the theme of this study. Through a laboratory experiment, it is verified how the credibility of the advertisers of the products and the prior knowledge of the brand can affect the positive perception of the advertisement. The campaigns are again the protagonists of the following text prepared by Carlos Fanjul Peyr\u00f3, Cristina Gonz\u00e1lez O\u00f1ate and Marta del Carmen Santo Mirabet, from the Universitat Jaume I de Castell\u00f3n (Spain). In this case, they delve into the analysis of \"Institutional campaigns for the prevention of suicide in Spain. Analysis of the strategic change in their social communication: Valencian Community case \u201d. It is a latent topic in both social policies and information treatment, the social repercussion of which is analyzed by campaigns such as the one presented in this study. The projection of stereotypes in female fictional characters in a North American sitcom is the central axis of the article \"Non-verbal language as a constructive element of female stereotypes in the situation comedy Modern Family\", under the analysis of Dar\u00edo Mart\u00edn S\u00e1nchez, Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez Herrarte and Mar\u00eda Yolanda Fern\u00e1ndez Ramos, from the European University Miguel de Cervantes (Spain). In this article, the main non-verbal patterns of characters in the series are identified and related to the different female stereotypes. Data journalism is perceived as a great opportunity to improve the diversity and quality of sports coverage. This is the main conclusion reached by Jos\u00e9 Luis Rojas Torrijos and Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Cepero, from the University of Seville (Spain), in their proposal entitled: \u201cPerception of sports data journalism among heavy users. Case study of the predictive model of El Pa\u00eds for the 2018 World Cup\u201d. In it, they emphasize the expansion that data journalism has experienced, particularly in the coverage of soccer events. The Miscellaneous section concludes with \"Teaching and Learning in Public Relations Careers in Brazil: Incorporation of Digital Platforms\", written by Maria Aparecida Ferrari, Juliane Martins and Victor Theodoro, from the Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil), Universidade Federal do Paran\u00e1 (Brazil) and Universidade de Beira Interior (Portugal), respectively. This article analyzes how new pedagogical learning tools have been applied in the training of professionals in the field of public relations, within the context of Brazil. This volume concludes with four reviews of some interesting works published in recent years. Under the same thematic roof of the first monograph we start with Fake news: The truth about false news, prepared by \u00c1lvaro Jim\u00e9nez Rodr\u00edguez, from the University of Alicante, about the book that Marc Amor\u00f3s has published with the same title (Barcelona: Plataforma, 2018 ). Next, we present Spanish Cinema of the New Millennium, by Luis Miguel Mach\u00edn Mart\u00edn, from the University of La Laguna (Tenerife, Spain), on the work of Thomas G. Deveny (Bristol: Intellect Books, 2019). What follows is a review of Transmedia content for proximity radio television, by Esteban Gal\u00e1n, Aar\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez-Serrano and Javier Marzal-Felici (Pamplona: EUNSA, 2018), by Pablo Vizca\u00edno-Alcantud, from the University of Alicante. Below is included Pateras to the South. The speech of a look at any place in the world, conversing from the South, by Almudena Barrientos-Ba\u00e9z, from the University of La Laguna, about the work of J. Ignacio \"I\u00f1aki\" Chaves G. (Tenerife: Sociedad Latina de Comunicaci\u00f3n Social and UNIMINUTO, 2018). En estos tiempos de modernidad l\u00edquida (Bauman), todo es din\u00e1mico, permeable y cambiante. Esperemos que la realidad vivida durante el periodo en el que este n\u00famero se ha ido gestando, se torne en un futuro pr\u00f3ximo en una situaci\u00f3n en la que el virus se controle del todo y asistamos a la invenci\u00f3n de la tan ansiada vacuna. Mientras tanto, desde MJC, queremos hacer una menci\u00f3n especial a quienes han sufrido especialmente la tragedia, a las v\u00edctimas, familiares y a las personas que han estado en el campo de batalla diario para hacer frente al temido coronavirus. Tambi\u00e9n a quienes han sabido adaptarse a la nueva situaci\u00f3n desde todos los \u00e1mbitos y han modificado su escenario de trabajo por los entornos digitales. Y a quienes, con mucha paciencia, esperan recuperar su d\u00eda a d\u00eda. A todas y todos, os dedicamos este n\u00famero cargado de emociones.  In this time of liquid modernity (Bauman), everything is dynamic, permeable and changing. Let us hope that the reality lived during the period in which this number has been brewing, will become in the near future a situation in which the virus is completely controlled and we will assist in the invention of the long-awaited vaccine. Meanwhile, from MJC, we want to make a special mention to all those who have especially suffered the tragedy, to the victims, relatives and people who have been on the daily battlefield to face the dreaded coronavirus. Also to all those who have been able to adapt to the new situation, from all areas, and have modified their working environment by digital environments. And to all those who, patiently, hope to recover their day by day. To you all, we dedicate this emotion-filled issue.   \n             MONOGR\u00c1FICO/ SPECIAL ISSUE: Noticias falsas y su impacto en la credibilidad de los medios / Misinformation and the increases of social vulnerability   \t       Farias-Batlle, P., Rodr\u00edguez-Barba, D. y Nelson, J.

United States. jacob.nelson.1@asu.edu \tMisinformation and the increases of social vulnerability Noticias falsas y su impacto en la credibilidad de los medios \t\tThe increase in technological capacities for dissemination and reception in the last decade has brought enormous possibilities for the dissemination of information. Real time has changed the way we interact with the world around us by transforming the way we communicate and inform. Connectivity has transformed everything. But something is being lost in the way of this great change, as the dangerous imbalances in the flows of information increase and a certain loss of value is noticed. Misinformation increases, which also increases social vulnerability to manipulation. The traditional media (due to low consumption, loss of information quality, deficient adaptation to change weakening their editorial staff, competition from new non-professionalised actors that are more agile and technologically attractive) are not being suitable to fulfil their function as references for credible and contrasting information. The gradual loss of confidence in media reports, the increase in fake news and the decrease in the credibility of institutions are one more effect of the process, but it entails enormous risks. The growing scepticism of citizens towards any type of information (individual, institutional or from the media) is worrying, which with its expansive effect generates great uncertainty as to what is true or not true. Scepticism, which is a magnificent system of critical defence against information, can become a problem when it is produced without sufficient media literacy and critical capacity from the part of the audience. Increasing even more if it is faced with a deficient quality of professional information making the media and its information not being perceived as reliable references. The term post-truth (or more precisely post-actuality), which is applied to the present moment, refers to the phenomenon by which objective facts have less influence than the appeal to emotions. It is the moment when \"something that appears to be true is more important than the truth itself\" (Caro, 2016). It is also the alarming moment when information is confused with opinions and propaganda. When the discrediting of facts and the emergence of \"truthiness\" (or mere appearance of truth) \"facilitates the emergence or growth of populisms\" (Arias, 2016). Nowadays such circumstances exist: times of exposure to professional media news have been reduced, information is more and more superficial and banal, confusion between what is information and opinion is growing and deficiently contrasted news or false news are flooding the net and bombarding citizens as incidental information. And in this process of enormous confusion for the information receiver (who tries to simplify the current complicated action of being informed) the tendency to \"feel\" informed seems to be installed confronting the effort and time that requires to be \"truly\" informed, since now this demands contrasting the torrent of information daily received without clarity on the sources of reference. \n 10 If one doesn't trust the media and the information they produce, if one doeesn't trust the institutions and their information is doubted, if the training to exercise criticism in the face of the bombardment of information is low... if all this happens, the possibilities that the disinformation that floods the network, much of which is received incidentally, becomes the main source of information for the population, is even greater. As is also the possibility of manipulation by those who, denouncing the media as a reference point, rise up as the only sources worthy of quality and trust and subjugate them with orchestrated disinformation campaigns. All this makes the media system less muscular, which also produces enormous social weakness. \"False news and its impact on media credibility\", opens with the article by Juan-Pedro Molina-Ca\u00f1abate and Ra\u00fal Magall\u00f3n-Rosa where the case of Maldita Ciencia is studied, also a good example of entrepreneurial journalism and which in its first year of life has given much evidence about the need for verification in specialized information, in this case, the scientific one. Unfortunately, events are faster than publications. At the close of this monographic issue, Spain is suffering the consequences of the 2020 pandemic and an article like this one, on disinformation and scientific journalism, is more relevant than ever. One of the main conclusions the reader will probably reach is that verification is not possible without independence and innovative drive in newspaper companies. Mar\u00eda-Jos\u00e9 Ufarte-Ruiz, Guisseppe Anzera and Francisco-Jos\u00e9 Murcia-Verd\u00fa map out the independent fact-checking platforms in Spain and Italy, delving into their work methodology and characteristics. Misinformation or intentional hoaxes are not a new phenomenon. What is new is the speed and extent that can be achieved in propagation. Juan-Luis Manfredi and Miguel del-Fresno-Garc\u00eda put the focus on the 24 hours between October the 26th and the 27th, 2017, when an unconfirmed news item led to a change in the public's perception of Carles Puigdemont. The image of the then president of the regional Government of Catalonia became polarized in that small space of time from hero to traitor. Along the same lines and also focusing on Catalonia, Julen Orbegozo-Terradillos, Jordi Morales-i-Gras and Ainara Larrondio-Ureta, apply mass data analysis techniques in social networks and thus get to know how incorrect information and subsequent corrections are spread unevenly in a highly politicised network to which different groups of users are exposed without exercising or even having sufficient critical capacity. Leticia Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez, completes the tour for the use of trick information in politics with her article Junk News and \"disinformation media\" in the election campaign of 10-N (Spain) analyzing the content of several Spanish pages, identified within the so-called \"disinformation ecosystem\". The \"news find me\" techniques are the object of analysis in the article by Francisco Segado-Boj, Jes\u00fas D\u00edaz-Campo, Enrique Navarro-Asencio and Lorena Remacha-Gonz\u00e1lez. Taking the contents on climate change consumed by individuals from a sensitive and receptive sample, the evaluation and subsequent interaction is analyzed according to the user's perception of \"encounter\" or \"selection\" with such contents. To close, Mar\u00eda-del-Carmen Garc\u00eda-Galera, Mercedes del-Hoyo-Hurtado and Ignacio Blanco-Alfonso, focus on professional performance. Their article speaks about disinformation and communicative intent, about the responsibility of journalists not to serve as transmitters of false news due to lack of rigor. Credibility and trust are being hopelessly undermined and destroyed if sufficient resources are not devoted to producing perfectly verifiable content. Thanks to the authors and our editors Victoria Tur Vi\u00f1es, Carmen Marta-Lazo and Jes\u00fas Segarra-Saavedra for all their support and work with us.         \nMolina-Ca\u00f1abate, J.P. & Magall\u00f3n-Rosa, R.

Thus, employing a combination of methodologies both quantitative (social media use and analysis) and qualitative (personal interviews) allows for the study of the processes to create false contents that appear like scientific information, how audiences end up assuming they are true and how they go viral. In parallel, it is essential to know how these types of misinformation are verified and picked apart, and we propose analysis methods depending on the type of hoax or unfounded rumour in question.  El objetivo de esta investigaci\u00f3n es analizar el trabajo del colectivo period\u00edstico Maldita Ciencia en su primer a\u00f1o de vida, incluidos sus procesos de verificaci\u00f3n y difusi\u00f3n. De este modo, a trav\u00e9s de una combinaci\u00f3n de metodolog\u00edas cuantitativas (uso y an\u00e1lisis de redes sociales) y cualitativas (entrevistas personales) se estudian los procesos de creaci\u00f3n de contenidos falsos con apariencia de informaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica, de qu\u00e9 forma los p\u00fablicos los asumen como ciertos y c\u00f3mo estos la viralizan.

Introduction  Anti-vaccination and flat Earth movements, alleged diseases caused by electromagnetic waves, climate change denial and pseudo-therapies have all been seen in recent years in the digital world, seeking to amplify their discourse and convert new sympathisers and militants (Bigas, 2019).  False contents that seems scientific have commonalities with misinformation on politics or migratory movements (Fletcher, Cornia, Graves and Nielsen, 2018). From this perspective, as Alexandre L\u00f3pez-Borrull and Candela Oll\u00e9 point out, \u2018the scientific world has also the challenge of facing the truth, half-truths and misinformation\u2019 (L\u00f3pez-Borrull and Oll\u00e9, 2019). These falsehoods often arise from misinformation strategies whose aim is to create traffic towards specific pages for the financial benefit of their owners (Silverman, Singer-Vine and Thuy, 2017). There are often underlying moral or ideological reasons as well (Benkler, Faris, Roberts and Zuckerman, 2017). On occasion, they go viral extremely quickly because they speak (and advise us) about matters that affect our daily lives (Freelon, 2017). In any case and as Javier Salas (2018) reminds us, the main noteworthy causes of this new scenario include the fact that \u2018platforms like Facebook and YouTube do not stop spreading misinformation and unfounded rumours about health\u2019.  Moreover, one of the problems posed in the fight against scientific misinformation is that regular consumers of scientific news are less committed to disseminating science and more likely to leave comments on conspiracy pages (Bessi, Coletto, Davidescu, Scala, Caldarelli and Quattrociocchi, 2015). The present research has two main objectives: \u2022 The first one is to find out how false contents that appear like scientific information are created, how audiences assume they are real and how they go viral. \u2022 The second objective is to find out how these types of false messages are fact-checked and deconstructed. To conduct this study, we chose a methodology that combines both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Thus, we analysed the Twitter account of the journalism organisation Maldita Ciencia during its first year of life (from 27 June 2018 to 27 June 2019)[1] and we interviewed its project coordinator, journalist Roc\u00edo P\u00e9rez, seeking patterns to recognise unfounded rumours (Magall\u00f3n-Rosa, 2018) During the design phase for this research, we started from these hypotheses: H1 \u2013 Contents with a scientific appearance are easily propagated via social media because information consumers cannot easily compare them and do not know which reliable sources to turn to. H2 \u2013 There is a need for an independent fact-checking body that, without employing academic or scientific language, is capable of debunking false information in a way that is approachable and easy for audiences who (without any previous knowledge of the topic and barely aware of this) have contributed to it going viral.   1.1. Status of the subject In 2018, \u2018misinformation\u2019 was picked as the Word of the Year by Dictionary.com. In 2017, Collins chose the expression \u2018fake news\u2019 and in 2016 Oxford Dictionaries selected \u2018post-truth\u2019.  Since then, and despite the fact that the media debate on the importance of not using the term fake news has not received the support needed, the use of the word \u2018misinformation\u2019 has garnered more success in academic settings. In 2017, Claire Wardle and Hossein Derakhshan published a report entitled Information Disorder: Toward an interdisciplinary framework for research and policy-making, in which they advocated: We refrain from using the term \u2018fake news\u2019 for two reasons. First, it is woefully inadequate to describe the complex phenomena of information pollution. The term has also begun to be appropriated by politicians around the world to describe news agencies whose coverage they find disagreeable. In this way, it\u2019s becoming the mechanism by which the powerful can clamp down upon, restrict, undermine and circumvent the free press (Wardle and Derakhsan, 2017: 16). In this regard, approaching the misinformation phenomenon has become increasingly more glocal \u2013 compared to the initial research that was primarily centred on the US elections and the Anglo-Saxon context \u2013 and, in parallel, more specialised, incorporating new methodologies and players that try to fight against the updating of misinformation software that is being developed in different fields that have very little a priori in common, such as politics and science.  13 In this new ecosystem, fact-checkers \u2018not only report the facts, but publicly decide which ones they are\u2019 (Graves, 2013: 18). In any case, and if fact-checking is almost never capable of repairing the damages caused by misinformation, its mere existence can in fact help to reduce the misinformation that is disseminated (Nyhan and Reifler, 2012).   1.2. Research methodology and questions Firstly, this research presents a theoretical corpus that defines the parameters within which misinformation moves, what its causes are and the interests behind them. Secondly, we conducted a quantitative study and a qualitative analysis whose object of study is the fact-checking work done by the journalism team Maldita Ciencia, via its Twitter account.  We chose this platform because an easily delimited and measurable sample can be obtained there. To this end, we analysed the contents published during its first year of life (27 June 2018 to 27 June 2019). A total of 3242 tweets. We used two complementary analytical tools. The first, open source: T-Hoarder, which works with a methodology called t-hoarder_kit. It has been active since 2012 and meets the requirements for objectivity, transparency and knowledge sharing (Congosto, Basanta-Val and S\u00e1nchez Fern\u00e1ndez, 2017). These tools must be employed in a Linux and Python environment. T-hoarder_kit uses the Twitter APIs: REST, Search and Streaming. The second tool we used is the premium version of a commercial application: Twytonomy, a Twitter analysis tool. In total and as summarised in Table 1, we recorded 3242 tweets that had 283,902 retweets and 140,511 likes throughout the defined year, which translates into 87 retweets per tweet and 43 favourites per tweet. Table 1. Posts, retweets and favourites reached Post type Total interactions By tweet Total retweets 283,902 87.57001851 Total favourites/likes 140,511 43.34083899 Total tweets 3,242  Source: Prepared by authors. Then we selected a sample of the most retweeted tweets (and therefore, the most visible) to discover their paradigmatic traits and establish a debunking type. Finally, we interviewed Roc\u00edo P\u00e9rez, the coordinator of Maldita Ciencia.[2] These steps led to us validating our hypotheses, discovering traits for debunking and posing lines for discussion. Under this approach, our initial research questions were: Q1. Which tweets have the most retweets and likes posted on the account? What types of tweets are they? Q2. What are the posting patterns for disproving unfounded +rumours? Q3. Can we classify the types of unfounded rumours related to science communications from the use of its Twitter account? Q4. What relationship is established with scientific experts by Maldita Ciencia?   2. Information on scientific contents versus communication of pseudosciences The problem with the dissemination of science (Peters, 2013) has been affected by the new global and cross-cutting scenario of misinformation. However, and despite the fact that there are common problems, each country has its own particular features (Humprecht, 2018).  As Salas 2018 points out, \u2018Internet is the second means to access information on pseudo-therapies in Spain and two-thirds of the citizens research and get information about health on the web\u2019. A report by the Barcelona Association of Physicians and Surgeons, the Catalan Department of Health and the Catalan Audiovisual Council reported that when searching for \u2018cure\u2019 and \u2018cancer\u2019 on YouTube, 74% of the top 50 results were hoaxes and pseudoscientific messages (Vega, 2019).  14 In this regard, one of the challenges of scientific communication is that the defenders of conspiracies and pseudosciences may not only reject scientific proof, but also spend cognitive resources to discredit them (Sunstein and Vermeule, 2009). From this perspective, Scheufele and Krause (2019) list these difficulties for advancing with scientific dissemination and popularisation: lack of understanding of science, upholding of beliefs that are unsustainable with scientific progress, imprecise opinions about scientific knowledge and conspiracy-paranoid beliefs (Byford, 2011).  For his part, L\u00f3pez-Borrull points out that \u2018under the umbrella of fake science, we can include two phenomena: on the one hand, there is specific knowledge that is still not firmly established among the scientific community and, on the other hand, part of fake science actually occurs within the scientific community itself\u2019 (Bigas, 2019). This fragmentation of reality becomes stronger and more deeply-rooted because conspiracy theories tend to reduce the complexity of reality to then explain significant social or political issues as traumas designed by powerful individuals or organisations (Bessi et al., 2015). In this way and as with political misinformation, individuals tend to seek cognitive shortcuts to complex problems with the aim of taking a side, feeding their own biases or establishing social responses (Lewandowsky, Cook, Oberauer and Marriott, 2013).   3. Fact-checking scientific contents: the case of Maldita Ciencia In recent years, fact-checking initiatives have evolved very quickly. In this regard, the establishment of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) merits mention, whose central offices are at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. In the United States, which is a leader and reference for fact-checking projects, the format has been developed since the 2008 presidential elections (Graves and Glaisyer, 2012), although FactCheck.org was launched earlier, in 2003, and the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker in 2007. At the beginning of 2020, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab counted 225 active fact-checking organisations.[3]  However, the checking of scientific contents has not had almost any impact and has not been widespread to date, due to which the study of Maldita Ciencia was an innovative and significant undertaking. Just like Maldito Bulo, Maldita Migraci\u00f3n (Molina-Ca\u00f1abate and Magall\u00f3n-Rosa, 2019) and Maldita Hemeroteca, Maldita Ciencia is another section of Maldita.es, a non-profit organisation whose purpose is to fact-check information circulating on the internet, especially on social media like Facebook and Twitter, messaging apps like WhatsApp and platforms like YouTube. Maldita Ciencia started online on 27 June 2018 with the aim of broadening the range of fact-checking to also include scientific information. According to Roc\u00edo P\u00e9rez, project coordinator, the types of unfounded rumours and hoaxes are really not so different across subject matters. Thus, there wouldn\u2019t be much difference between the causes for example, of misinformation on migrants and the misinformation promoted by the pseudosciences:  \u2018It is not really that different. There are several interests: one is financial, as there are people who earn money if you believe that organic food is healthier than non-organic food, and there are people who earn money if you buy specific pills for losing weight. That is easy to understand. But then there are also underlying ideological questions, although not the ideology that we commonly consider. For example, if we consider that whether or not believing in vaccinations is an ideological fight, then you\u2019ve got a battlefield.\u2019 For matters of scientific misinformation, Facebook and YouTube are the two platforms with the greatest power to go viral, each one for different reasons. According to P\u00e9rez, the false information in the guise of science that most often goes viral has a common pattern: the more of an everyday issue that it is, the more viral it goes and the more debate it generates.  They even go viral \u2013 explains P\u00e9rez \u2013 because people want to help others, giving them advice. To this she adds that \u2018not everyone has the knowledge required to form a sound judgement to start with\u2019. Information related to health is the clearest example. Concretely, information on diets and eating habits and cancer. These types of unfounded rumours are tough to debunk and, as P\u00e9rez explains, because the cause-effect of an eating habit takes decades to be seen. From this viewpoint, the misinformation categories that they work with at Maldita Ciencia are:[4] 1. Hoaxes and unfounded rumours: When information is simply a lie. 2. What we know: When at Maldita Ciencia they do not say something is a lie, but that it is not exactly the truth either. This tends to happen when there is a study that is done poorly (\u2018Bad science leads to bad scientific information\u2019, explains Roc\u00edo P\u00e9rez) or is misinterpreted.[5]  15 3. Explanation: \u2018Maldita explains\u2019, Questions that people have been listening to for a long time. In this regard, it is important to point out that false information reaches people via several channels: 1. The most basic channel is monitoring social media.  2. The audience can make any queries it wants, and privately via WhatsApp (+34 655 19 85 38). 3. Scientific consultancy. 4. They pay attention to the searches that users make on its websites. 5. Finding hoaxes on Facebook through an agreement with this platform. From there, Maldita Ciencia checks certain posts with dubious contents.  In this context, it seems advisable to ask ourselves: Does fact-checking need to be done by third parties, independent journalism organisations? P\u00e9rez is unsure whether all independent institutes doing fact-checking actually have authority and influence. What she does know is that the general public penalises for-profit organisations and Maldita Ciencia is a non-profit platform that has committed to transparency (economic and their working method process) and has progressively been creating its own community under the umbrella brand Maldita.  3.1. Internal organisation, methodology and fact-checking processes The transparency of fact-checkers is one of the fundamental principles of the signatories of the IFCN (IFCN International Fact-Checking Network). In this regard, we should remember that Maldita is a non-profit organisation that relies on several agreements for its survival:[6] 1. An agreement with Facebook, for which it does fact-checking tasks. 2. A crowdfunding campaign to become a foundation.[7]  3. Collaboration agreements with different traditional journalism media. 4. By obtaining awards, such as the one granted by the Telef\u00f3nica Foundation to make an app, and by the European Journalism Centre to conduct CRM. 5. The group also raises funds through talks and training courses. With regard to newsmaking and fact-checking methods (Cassany, Corti\u00f1as and Elduque, 2018), the procedure Maldita Ciencia works with is \u2013 as Roc\u00edo P\u00e9rez acknowledges \u2013 traditional journalism (Secko, Amend and Friday, 2013). When they receive information with signs or evidence of it being fake, they turn, on the one hand, to documentary sources (scientific articles, papers and studies) and, on the other, scientific societies and different experts with whom they can compare the information. Maldita Ciencia does not sign its articles for two reasons: the first is to make it clear that the text is the outcome of teamwork and a methodology and, second, to protect authors\u2019 identities from possible haters, trolls and personal attacks. P\u00e9rez explains that they have had to vary their debunking method over the course of time. They are increasingly more cautious in their use of categorical phrases like: \u2018That is not true\u2019 and prefer to use expressions like \u2018There is no evidence that\u2019. Being less conclusive when refuting information perhaps makes them less forceful or emphatic, but they are aware that scientific information must be handled with scientific prudence.  4. Maldita Ciencia\u2019s use of Twitter: dissemination and popularisation, literacy and creation of communities 4.1. Sources of hoaxes According to the sample of the most retweeted tweets, the vast majority of misinformation that Maldita Ciencia deconstructs is related to health: homeopathy, drinking raw milk, whether or not vaccinations are advisable, detox diets, whether or not a sexual option is considered a disease. The analysis of the most retweeted tweets and their accompanying news articles lets us design the types of sources of the false information being dismantled. Thus, we can differentiate between vague sources, celebrities who support movements without scientific grounds and institutions that delay revealing proof.   16 Table 2. Types of misinformation sources and main characteristics  Vague sources This is the most common origin. General beliefs that are taken as true due to being heard or read. They are often supported by scientific or pseudoscientific studies that are misinterpreted, taken out of context or that lack validity due to not being corroborated over time or having any scientific research conducted. Celebrities Celebrities that get carried away by an idea and share it publicly. Institutions that delay in showing proof Official reports and contradictory studies that feed into general uncertainty. Source: Prepared by authors.  When we speak of vague sources, we are referring to the false information that assures that vaccinations cause serious diseases, how good detox diets and foods are for you, that milk is bad for our health or that it is better to drink it unpasteurised. Image 1. Tweet refuting detox. \n Source: Maldita Ciencia. Examples of celebrities that are carried away or influenced by an idea and share it publicly would be Iker Casillas questioning whether the Earth is flat and Teresa Jord\u00e1, former Catalan minister of Agriculture and Livestock, advocating drinking raw milk. An example of institutions that delay in revealing evidence: the WHO considered homosexuality a disease until 1990. Image 2. Tweet debunking the good qualities of raw milk. \n Source: Maldita Ciencia \n 17 From the viewpoint of impact, notable results include the fact that Maldita Ciencia\u2019s dissemination of tweets is indeed important if we bear in mind the 82,550 plus followers it had only 12 months after it was founded (close to 95,000 at the beginning of 2020). Our quantitative analysis show that its tweets obtain one favourite (like) for every two retweets, which means they are contents people save to read at a later time, but also that a lot of information is recycled and periodically posted again.  Percentage of retweets and likes reached per month \n Percentage of retweets reached per month                    Like\u00b4s percentage reached per month Source: Prepared by authors. Moreover, it is clear that \u2013 if we bear in mind the growth curve of the impact of Maldita Ciencia \u2013 its first month (July 2018) was the most important, with over 42,513 retweets and 26,870 favourites, never reaching similar figures again in subsequent months (only in February 2019 did the number of retweets exceed those in July 2018.   4.2. Debunking standard related to pseudoscientific information The content we are studying is transmedia (Scolari, 2013: 46). All its items form part of a large narrative, where users can consume them either separately or as a whole. Users also have the power to take part in the creative communication process: not only can they retweet a tweet, for example, but they can also add to it or participate in a thread. Table 3. Formal content patterns of Maldita Ciencia Simple and educational language, often with a bit of humour.[8]  With photographs or videos that capture readers\u2019 attention. Which include a link to a news article. Which use hashtags for visibility or to cause a certain emotional state. Which use a word in capitals or, otherwise, an emoticon. Which open threads to encourage participation and go into greater depth on the subject.  Source: Prepared by authors Generally (and this nuance is important, even more so for the case we are studying), transmedia content houses different levels of depth with regard to knowledge of the message. Thus, we find that the most superficial level is simply reading the tweet. The deepest level would be consulting the papers that Maldita Ciencia refers to as a source for comparison.  \n 18 In the sample of the most retweeted tweets we find references to papers and documents from renowned universities, such as Harvard University, and organisations with visibility, such as Northern Rivers Vaccination Supporters, the Journal of Human Dietetics and Nutrition and the WWF. Expert opinions often include scientists and/or university professors. They include references to David Robert Grimes, physicist at the University of Oxford; Miguel \u00c1ngel Lurue\u00f1a, doctor in Food Science and Technology, as well as experts on the subject, such as \u00c1lex Riveiro.

The beauty of artists @yo_doctor 1342 Source: Prepared by authors. One of the purposes of fact-checking organisations is the search for their own distinctive style that will lead to their recognition as a trustworthy and reliable brand. From this perspective, Maldita Ciencia has established a series of patterns, both in form and in content, that let it be identified in order to create a contract of trust and recognition.  5. Conclusions As we have verified, the immense majority of the misinformation that Maldita Ciencia deconstructs and debunks is health related: homeopathy, drinking raw milk, whether or not vaccinations are advisable, detox diets, and so forth. To this end, it offers five keys to knowing how to distinguish between scientific information and pseudoscientific information (Maldita Ciencia, 2018): 1. While science uses extremely precise terms, pseudoscience uses vague words (holistic, purify, mind, spirit, etc. etc.). 2. Science provides proof; pseudoscience does not. 3. Science uses data; pseudoscience takes advantage, especially, of testimonies. 4. Sciences advance; pseudosciences do not. 5. Science explains.[9] With these premises, we have to point out that the present research study validates the hypotheses set out at the beginning of the text: 1. False information that apparently has a scientific nature is easily propagated via social media because information consumers cannot easily compare it and do not know which reliable sources to turn to. The sources that Maldita Ciencia mentions for comparison are not within reach of just any user. While true that the documentary sources openly reveal their knowledge, their contextualisation is the field of experts.  2. An independent fact-checking body is needed that, without employing academic or scientific language, can debunk false information in a way that is approachable and easy for audiences who (without any previous knowledge of the topic and barely aware of this) have contributed to it going viral. The general public tends to penalise for-profit institutions. Maldita Ciencia is not and this makes them seem impartial.  19 In this regard, digital literacy has become one of the agreed-upon solutions by governments and institutions to the problem of misinformation. From this viewpoint, the need to implement scientific literacy campaigns seems obvious, by the Ministries of Health or Science and by the competent autonomous community departments.  The adaptation of new codes and languages for scientific communication is seen as one of the most important challenges in upcoming years. In this regard, it would be interesting to explore the possibility that the WhatsApp issue of Maldita Ciencia could be disseminated and integrated into the calendars of the Maldita community, with the aim of reducing the focal points of misinformation and disinformation, but above all to make the scientific contents that form part of our society\u2019s daily conversations go viral and share them. From an internal operational viewpoint, it would be advisable for Maldita Ciencia \u2013 like what is done with Maldito Bulo \u2013 to have a series of internal categories to identify contents by subject matter (health, diets, vaccinations, sex, etc.). The present study also reveals that the survival of fact-checking institutions involves juggling several funding sources that guarantee their independence. However, we must ask ourselves if the future of these organisations is ensured, as they must rely on one-off collaboration agreements that have little continuity over time. And, lastly, this research has discovered that misinformation in the scientific field is produced as a consequence of the slowness of corporate communications of the institutions involved in scientific communication: from hospitals to ministries and from universities to laboratories.  With regard to the future prospects for research into scientific misinformation and fact-checking, there must be more in-depth studies about how they are affecting the relationship between technology companies and fact-checkers to penalise the circulation of pseudoscientific contents. The benefits of these new studies would include being able to analyse which narratives work best to debunk hoaxes and falsehoods, depending on the network or social platform (Magall\u00f3n-Rosa, 2019), understanding that reliable sources and false content distribution can be different and that mechanisms so that they go viral are also different.  6.

In recent years, fact-checking has become an extremely important activity in journalism as a result of the increased circulation of fake news and the ease with which it can be disseminated on platforms like social networks. This study analyses the structure, composition and operation of independent fact-checking platforms in Spain and Italy. To this end, three different qualitative techniques have been used: the case study technique applied to each initiative, in-depth semi-structured interviews with its co-founders or managers, and website content analysis. This triangulation of techniques has allowed us to draw conclusions and provide examples of relevance to the research. The results reveal that the projects have a large community of followers on social networks, a multidisciplinary team of staff engaged mainly in checking political statements and information circulating on the Internet, and a business model that differs substantially from the conventional model in journalism.

Introduction Technological evolution has transformed the map of media communications (Pavlik, 2000). Constant change has become a basic feature of the mass media (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2019), driven by the digitalisation of information processes. Digital technology has transformed the professional routines of journalists (Mic\u00f3 & P\u00e9rez, 2015), opened up new possibilities for content production (Hermida & Thurman, 2008) and consumption (Casero-Ripoll\u00e9s, 2012), and given rise to new business models in the sector (Breiner, 2013). In the new media ecosystem, the monopoly on news communications has been broken up so that now newspaper, magazine and book publishers and the mass media are not the only ones with the capacity to bring news stories to the public (Casero-Ripoll\u00e9s & L\u00f3pez-Meri, 2015). The existence of multiple sources of information has resulted in a veritable \u201cinformation overload\u201d (Martin, 2017), which is further complicated by the high degree of trust and credibility enjoyed by certain individuals on the new platforms (Choi, 2015), the huge quantity of information circulating on technological infrastructures and the strategies applied to exert the biggest impact on social behaviour (Berinsky, 2015; Currie & Bloyd, 2018: Lopez, Vives & Badell, 2018). The Internet and social networks are a hotbed of information and stories to tell, but at the same time they constitute a space with blurred boundaries where any user can reach a massive audience with content that is not necessarily very reliable (Bergstr\u00f6m & Jervelycke, 2018). As a result, the new media ecosystem is a realm prone to erroneous, inaccurate, malicious, invented and unfounded information that can mislead readers and hinder the objectives of anyone who wants to know the truth (Zommer, 2014). The expression \u201cfake news\u201d refers to distorted information (Khaldarova & Pantti, 2016) presented as fact but highly misleading (Tandoc, Lim & Ling, 2018) as it has been altered, lampooned or reinterpreted (Balmas, 2012) in pursuit of particular ideological or economic interests (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017). For Rubin, Chen & Conroy (2015), this concept also covers news presented in the sensationalist press published with unverified and exaggerated headlines, large-scale hoaxes and humorous fake news stories. Tandoc, Lim & Ling (2018) suggest that the concept should also include satirical news, parodies, and false content presented in a journalistic style with no warning to the audience, the manipulation of images, advertising content with the appearance of news reports, and propaganda. Derakhshan & Wardle (2017) stress intention as a crucial factor for understanding this phenomenon, while Zaryan (2017) argues that what is really important is that people are able to access this information and share it, in an age when the ways and means of obtaining information have changed, especially among young people (L\u00f3pez, Gonz\u00e1lez & Medina, 2011). However, for Catalina-Garc\u00eda, Sousa & Silva (2019) the issue lies in whether audiences are capable of differentiating fake news from real news, as people will often readily accept information that fits in with their world-view (Mihailidis & Viotty, 2017). In any case, the consequences are invariably negative because truth is confused with lie, the credibility of misinformation is enhanced (Rapp & Salovich, 2018), and democratic discourse is undermined (Champy, 2011; Codeluppi, 2018; Fisher, 2018; McChesney, 2014). However, the phenomenon of false news is hardly unique to the current period (Burkhardt, 2017; Petroni & Anzera, 2017). It is in fact an old practice that has played a prominent role throughout the history of communication, especially in times of war and during interwar periods to promote particular interests (Bloch, 1999; Schudson & Zelizer, 2017). Nevertheless, it has taken a new turn in the contemporary era, especially with the rise of social networks (Haigh, Haigh & Kozak, 2017; Pavlik, 2013; Watts & Rothschild, 2017) and particularly since Donald Trump began questioning the veracity of the information of certain media sources during his 2016 electoral campaign (Jankowski, 2018; Greenberg, 2017). Arising in response to this crisis of confidence in the news is fact-checking, a journalistic practice based on a posteriori confirmation of information published by the media and on the verification of statements or comments made by political leaders and other important figures (Mantzarlis, 2018). For Amor\u00f3s (2018), fact-checking is the best tool to counteract the power of fake news, as it has been developed by journalists to combat such misinformation and to give the public access to a version of events that faithfully reflects the reality. The origins of fact-checking as an institutionalised practice can be traced back to 1913, when the newspaper New York World established the Bureau of Accuracy and Fair Play, an agency dedicated to correcting oversights and eradicating falsehoods (Ayuso & Bauz\u00e1, 2018). The objective, in any case, is to contribute more effectively to the demand for accountable public representatives and a fully informed public\u2014a key point for strengthening democracy (Gueham, 2017; Nyhan & Reifler, 2014). In the contemporary era, this practice has become widespread and fact-checking initiatives have appeared in large numbers (Palau, 2015; Spivak, 2011; Stencel, 2016). Although the work of confirming and verifying facts has existed since journalism began, as a form of quality assurance (Ufarte, Peralta & Murcia, 25  2018), in recent years, many media outlets and independent platforms have created divisions, work groups or spaces for the verification of information published by other media sources and disseminated on social networks or announced by political leaders (Cherubini & Graves, 2016). As of 1 September 2019, the fact-checking census developed by the Reporters\u2019 Lab at Duke University (Duke Reporter\u2019s Lab, 2019) identifies a total 0f 269 fact-checking initiatives in 62 countries, of which 195 are active and 74 inactive. That is 143 initiatives more than in June 2017, when the Lab had identified a total of 126 websites and organisations dedicated to this kind of work, which in turn represented a 24% increase on the previous year and double the figure for 2015 (Adair & Thakore, 2015). V\u00e1zquez, Vizoso & Lopez (2019) have also conducted a global exploration of fact-checking projects, finding that Europe is the continent that is home to the largest proportion (51 initiatives), although they also identified projects in North America, Asia, South America, Africa and Oceania. The authors found that the country with the largest number of fact-checking platforms is the United States (31 in total), followed by France, India, Brazil, Indonesia and the United Kingdom, each with at least 5 fact-checking organisations. However, according to Graves (2016) the world of projects associated with fact-checking defies any attempt at categorisation. This practice has also given rise to a new professional profile (Ufarte & Manfredi, 2019) at a time when the demand for journalists is waning while the need for other types of professionals and specialists is on the rise (APM, 2018). This latter group includes fact-checkers, who are highly specialised in big data, i.e., they are experts at working with massive, complex volumes of information requiring computational methods to extract knowledge (Arcila, Barbosa & Cabezuelo, 2016; L\u00f3pez, Toural & Rodr\u00edguez, 2016; Uscinski & Butler, 2013), and who provide services involving the analysis, interpretation and reconstruction of information (Amazeen, 2015; Ren\u00f3 & Flores, 2014). To put it another way, these professionals make use of technology to produce better journalism and facilitate understanding of published news (Casero & Cullell, 2013; Paniagua, G\u00f3mez & Gonz\u00e1lez, 2014). The objective of this research is to analyse the structure, composition and operation of fact-checking platforms in Spain and Italy that are financially independent of conventional news corporations. The purpose of the analysis is to identify the corporate organisation of each project, their origins, the topics of the content that they check most, the techniques and methods they employ, their business models and their interactivity with users. The creation of these kinds of independent projects specialising in fact-checking is the result of the constant acceleration of the news cycle as a consequence of the dissemination of information online (Hermida, 2012). This study uses a qualitative method in order to test the following hypotheses: H1. These initiatives are made up of multidisciplinary teams, and thus a cross-section of knowledge, skills and attitudes is involved in the fact-checking process. H2. Political statements and information circulating on social networks constitute the type of content that is fact-checked the most, in keeping with the prevailing trend of soundbite journalism. The fact-checks are presented to the audience using textual explanations and identifying terms, visuals and colours. H3. The main sources of financing for these independent initiatives are partnerships with different media companies, social networks and other platforms. This financing by affiliation is different from the conventional model in journalism, which is based on advertising and subscriptions. H4. These projects have a large community of followers on social networks, who submit topics of dubious credibility circulating on these platforms so that they can be checked and verified. These communities of users constitute an active part of the project and are therefore quite different from the passive audience model that characterises traditional media.  2. Methodology The objective of this research is to analyse the structure, composition and operation of independent fact-checking platforms in Spain and Italy. These two countries were chosen for convenience due to their accessibility and proximity to the research team. This is an important point in view of the pressing need to defend models of journalism based on excellence and quality against the invasion of models that place a higher priority on traffic than relevance of published content. The methodological design adopted to achieve this objective is based on a review of the scientific literature, which forms part of the secondary research (Codina, 2017), and which has allows us to identify the main contributions made to this area of research. We have also used the case study method, which, according to Garc\u00eda-Avil\u00e9s & Gonz\u00e1lez Esteban (2012), can help shed light on the transformations in the media industry as it provides the researcher with a variety of sources such as interviews, participant observation, questionnaires and bibliographical documents, facilitating a better contextualisation of the 26  phenomena studied. The first stage of the research involved locating all the platforms identified in the two countries in the global census of fact-checking projects compiled by Duke University\u2019s Reporters\u2019 Lab. This research centre maintains a regularly updated website with a map showing the geographical location of 269 fact-checking initiatives around the world (Duke Reporter\u2019s Lab, 2019). Of that number, 195 were still active as of 1 September 2019 while 74 were inactive. As a result of this initial search, seven independent fact-checking initiatives were found. Four of these were in Spain: Ministerio de la Verdad (Miniver.org); Maldito Bulo; Newtral Media Audiovisual; and Pol\u00e9tika. The three Italian initiatives were: Pagella Politica; Agenzia Giornalistica Italia (AGI); and Lavoce.info. First of all, any projects associated with an existing media corporation were removed from the study sample. This was found to be the case for AGI and Lavoce.info: AGI\u2019s fact-checking activities are operated by an Italian news agency focusing on the economy and industry; while Lavoce.info is controlled by the economic magazine of the same name. Therefore, these two initiatives were excluded from the object of study. Secondly, we ensured that all the projects for study are signatories to the Code of Principles of the International Fact-Checking Network, a division of the Poynter Institute, whose objective is to bring together journalists working in the area of fact-checking all over the world. In this case, Pol\u00e9tika and Ministerio de la Verdad were found not to be signatories and were therefore also excluded from the study. Pol\u00e9tika is the product of a coalition of activist groups led by Oxfam Intermon and CIECODE (Spain\u2019s Research Centre on Policy Coherence and Development) created to monitor the political promises made in the campaigns prior to the Spanish general elections in 2015 and 2016. Meanwhile, Ministerio de la Verdad (Spanish for \u201cMinistry of Truth\u201d) was Spain\u2019s first fact-checking website, founded in 2006. The most recent activity on each of the projects was also analysed, and any initiatives that had not updated their websites with fact-checked news in the last three months were also excluded. This was the case, for example, of Ministerio de la Verdad, whose last update was on 1 April 2019, and Lavoce.info, which had its last update on 27 June 2019. The exclusions described above left a sample made up of only three projects, despite the increasing importance of these initiatives and the huge impact they have begun having on journalism, politics and society in general in recent years. The fact-checking initiatives studied were Maldito Bulo, Newtral Media Audiovisual and Pagella Politica. Having defined our study sample, we developed an analysis template that was then applied to each of the initiatives in the sample. This template was initially filled out based on a website content analysis (Herring, 2010), considering elements unique to an online environment like links and multimedia features to complement the analysis of traditional content (Bardin, 1977; Krippendorf, 2004). The variables analysed included the description, fact-checking methodology, business model and user interactivity of each of the three projects (Table 1).

Source: Compiled by authors. This exploratory study has been complemented by in-depth semi-structured interviews with co-founding members of Maldito Bulo (Clara Jim\u00e9nez) and Pagella Politica (Pietro Curatolo). In the case of Newtral Media Audiovisual, an interview was conducted with Maril\u00edn Gonzalo, coordinator of the platform\u2019s digital area. The interview questions were grouped into the following subject blocks: contextual aspects of the creation of the initiative, organisation, format, type of content, and business strategies. The answers obtained were used to develop a detailed description of each of the case studies. These initiatives play an important role in the industry. However, studies in the field of the news industry tend 27  to focus on big media corporations with large editorial teams, ignoring the fragmentation of the industry today. As a result, an increasing number of authors are pointing out the need to liberate academic research from the centralist notion of news production and to focus on aspects of the sector that fall outside traditional forms of journalism (Deuze & Witschge, 2017).  3. Case studies 3.1. Maldito Bulo This independent project, founded in May 2014, debunks fake news appearing on social networks and in the press. It was created by the journalists Julio Montes and Clara Jim\u00e9nez Cruz and is incorporated as an association. According to Clara Jim\u00e9nez, Maldito Bulo was founded with the aim of \u201ccleaning hoaxes and manipulations out of the news ecosystem.\u201d To this end, its main objectives focus on monitoring and verifying political discourse, fighting against disinformation and promoting media literacy and technological tools that can create a community capable of defending itself against disinformation wherever it appears. For its work, it was nominated in 2017 for the European Press Prize, and it is the only Spanish media service to form part of the High-Level Group on Fake News and Online Disinformation set up by the European Commission in 2018. In addition to its two co-founders, the Maldito Bulo team is made up of 22 professionals: David Fern\u00e1ndez, Roc\u00edo P\u00e9rez, Nacho Calle, Laura del R\u00edo, Laura Chaparro, St\u00e9phane M. Grueso, Bea Lara, Andr\u00e9s Jim\u00e9nez, Ferm\u00edn Grodira, Natalia Diez, Yuly Jara, Jos\u00e9 Molina, Adela Vived, Sergio Sangiao, Laura Garc\u00eda Merino, Luisa Bernal, Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz, Cindy Catherine Erazo, Carmen Garc\u00eda, Mario Vera, Antonio Maestre and Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez. Most are journalists with extensive professional experience with major Spanish media companies. The types of content checked by this team are mainly statements made by political leaders and hoaxes reported by its community of users. Its fact-checking process involves three stages. First, the staff investigate the disinformation to be debunked and put together an initial description of the hoax. This process involves contacting primary sources, checking the origin of the information, comparing it against data from official sources and performing technological processes of image, video or audio identification if necessary. In the second stage, via a Telegram group, the rest of the team raises questions about the fact-check: for example, what sources the information has been checked against, how a given conclusion has been reached, and what technical processes have been followed to debunk it. Finally, after verifying the fact-checker\u2019s work, the whole team votes on the result. If there is no vote against it, it is posted with a simple majority, while if there is a dissenting vote, the fact-checking process has to be repeated from the beginning. The fact-checks are presented to the audience by means of brief, concise textual commentary, either confirming or debunking the facts that have been checked. The initiative also uses a colour scale ranging from soft colours like green or blue to stronger ones like red or black. This colour coding indicates the reliability of the content that has been subject to fact-checking. In addition, fact-checked stories are presented in a news article format, with a headline, subheading, boxes containing the most relevant data and a body of text explaining the information that has helped determine whether the statements or data in question are true or false. These articles are also generally accompanied by documentary evidence like videos or photographs of the real content, the fake content or even a composite of both so that the user can compare the differences. Debunked information is also presented with labels like the word \u201cBULO\u201d (\u201choax\u201d) in large red letters (Image 1). \u201cWith all of this, we create content that gives citizens greater certainty about what is real and what isn\u2019t,\u201d explains Jim\u00e9nez. 28  Image 1. Information fact-checked by Maldito Bulo \nSource: https://maldita.es/ As a business, Maldito Bulo\u2019s multiplatform news content is produced mainly with volunteer support, and its main sources of financing are the partnerships it maintains with different media operations, including: the radio show Julia en la Onda, on Onda Cero; the programmes Las Ma\u00f1anas de RNE and Gente Despierta on the Spanish national radio network RNE; El Detector de Mentiras on the news website eldiario.es; and the public television network Telemadrid. For Jim\u00e9nez, these partnerships are essential to keep up the fight against disinformation and ensure the viability of the initiative, and, she adds, \u201cwe are open to exploring new synergies.\u201d The project has also received three grants from three different institutions: the European Journalism Centre\u2019s Engaged Journalism Accelerator; the Data Transparency Lab Call for Tools 2018; and the International Fact-Checking Network Crowdfunding Match. It also partners with Facebook to combat fake news on the platform. \u201cWe check messages, images and videos posted on this social network as part of its external fact-checking programme. To do this, we follow the same methodology that we use in our own daily work, maintaining independence and scientific rigour,\u201d adds Jim\u00e9nez. In terms of interactivity, Maldito Bulo offers users the possibility of contacting the team via email (contacto@maldita.es). The team is also present on Twitter (225,804 followers), Facebook (98,442 followers), and Instagram (28,700 followers). These social networks, together with a direct WhatsApp service (655198538) provide ways for users to submit potential fake news to its journalists so that it can be fact-checked. On this point, Clara Jim\u00e9nez points out that the platform receives more than 250,000 WhatsApp messages per day from users requesting fact-checking of information circulating on social networks. They have also developed innovative formats specifically designed for social networks and the creation of a community of followers committed to the project who contribute to the initiative. For the correction of errors Maldito Bulo has a rectification policy that establishes an obligation of transparency in the correction of their own mistakes, publicly acknowledging them on their website and on social networks.  3.2. Newtral Media Audiovisual Newtral Media Audiovisual is a media content start-up founded in January 2018 by the journalist Ana Pastor, who is the company\u2019s sole shareholder. It is incorporated as a single-member limited partnership and it offers three different types of services: the production of TV programmes and digital storytelling on social networks; innovation in journalism through fact-checking; and research based on artificial intelligence protocols. Its value proposition thus includes the use of a format and language that targets the people who use its services most: people aged 20 to 45. The initiative was established to \u201cknock down lies and hoaxes\u201d on the Internet, on the basis that \u201cjournalism, if it is done well, is an irreplaceable instrument that requires verification and technology to disseminate our reality and to help us detect whether a photo is fake or a video has been manipulated,\u201d explains Maril\u00edn \n29  Gonzalo, who adds that \u201cthe team\u2019s aspiration is to serve as a benchmark in fact-checking.\u201d Newtral Media Audiovisual was awarded the \u201cBest Audiovisual\u201d award at Global Fact V, held in Rome in 2017, and the international Digital Jove award for innovation, technology and digital storytelling. The project team is made up of a total of 66 individuals, including journalists, engineers, researchers, programmers, producers, directors, graphic artists and documentalists. More specifically, the team includes: Ana Pastor, journalist, founder; Tom\u00e1s Pastor, CEO; Joaqu\u00edn Ortega, content manager; Esperanza Mart\u00edn, production manager; Maribel S\u00e1nchez-Maroto; project manager; Rub\u00e9n M\u00edguez, innovation manager; Javier Dale, managing editor; Maril\u00edn Gonzalo, digital area coordinator; Alfred Camarote, technical department; and the graphic artists Nacho Mozos, Carlos Palanca and Gonzalo G\u00f3mez. Also on the team are the documentalists Antonio Prado, Yolanda Gaviro, Vanessa Pozo, and Patricia Gallego, and the journalists In\u00e9s Calder\u00f3n, M\u00edriam Ruiz, Javier Guzm\u00e1n, Lorena Baeza, Javier Nadales, Mar\u00eda Blanco, Brenda Valverde, Jes\u00fas Espinosa, Marisa L\u00f3pez, Mar Tomico, Paloma Corb\u00ed, Luis H. Rodr\u00edguez, Antonio Contreras, \u00c1lvaro Lorenzo, F\u00e1tima Gonz\u00e1lez Donado, Lara Monrosi, Olga Guti\u00e9rrez, Alba Mart\u00edn, Remedios Maro\u00f1as, Sara Gonz\u00e1lez, Borja Rodr\u00edgo, Nahiara S. Alonso, Ana G\u00f3mez Parra, Mario Viciosa, Noem\u00ed L\u00f3pez Trujillo, Roberto \u00c1lvarez, Beatriz Nogareda, Jacobo Pedraza, Yaiza Oliva, Mar\u00eda D\u00edez, and Adriana Silvente. Other team members are Alejandro Olvera, scriptwriter; Noelia Hidalgo, office manager; Ximo Fern\u00e1ndez, camera operator; Paula S. Jimeno, Paula Cruz and Juan Manuel Rocha in production; Mar\u00eda Benavente, developer, and David Marcos, programmer. In filmmaking are Marisa Lafuente, Andr\u00e9s Garv\u00eda, Ignacio Vilela, Rafael S\u00e1nchez, Ruth Carreras, Pepe Jim\u00e9nez and Mario Caballero, while Pablo \u00c1lvarez is technology lead and Hugo Casero is NLP engineer. Finally, Luis Pintado is software engineer and Itziar Bernaola is director of education. The aim of this initiative is to foster knowledge and talent in this field of study among future media professionals: \u201cIn university classrooms, students aren\u2019t taught fact-checking, which is why we are implementing projects like this one. We\u2019ve also launched several initiatives with universities,\u201d explains Gonzalo. The types of content most commonly fact-checked are statements by politicians and institutions and hoaxes circulating on social networks. The methodology adopted by the Newtral team involves several stages. The first is daily fact-checking of statements by politicians of different parties and governments in newspapers, radio and TV interviews, as well as on social networks and any other public platform. They identify claims of interest or importance from a purely journalistic perspective and assess the significance of the statement and the person who made it. They then consult the public and official data available with the aid of different sources and experts to contextualise and understand the information. They also contact the press offices of the politicians concerned to seek clarifications or additional information that may help determine the origin of a potentially dubious or confusing piece of data. This whole verification process goes through three different filters within the team before being published. If any error has occurred in the fact-checking process, the team rectifies it transparently as promptly as possible. \u201cInformation is the basis of all our work and we\u2019re convinced that its use, through innovation in journalism, is needed more than ever in the era of the battle against fake news,\u201d suggests Gonzalo. After the fact-checking process, Newtral Media Audiovisual presents the degree of veracity of the statement on a grading scale consisting of four points: 1) True. The information is accurate and not lacking in context or significant additional data. 2) Half-truth. The assertion is correct, but requires clarification, additional information or context. 3) Misleading. The information contains correct data but it ignores some very important aspects or is combined with incorrect data to give a different, inaccurate or false impression. 4) False. The assertion is false (Image 2). The information presented is also accompanied by videos, graphics or other visual elements. 30  Image 2. Information fact-checked by Newtral Media Audiovisual \nSource: https://www.newtral.es/ Newtral Media Audiovisual generates revenue from production services for media groups, social networks and other platforms. It is also financed by production contracts established with the television programmes El Objetivo and D\u00f3nde Estabas Entonces, both broadcast on the laSexta network, and with Telemadrid. It thus benefits from the promotional capacity of these documentary programmes, as both its brand name and its team members often appear on these programmes, although it maintains independence from the TV network. Newtral does not sell advertising or charge its users a subscription fee; its only alternative source of revenue is a contract with Facebook to fact-check news stories suspected of being fake. Gonzalo sums up the company\u2019s income sources as follows: \u201cWe have one essential source of financing that comes from television. With that revenue we could choose to get rich or to reinvest it to explore new territories, and we have done the latter. We are also now looking at self-financing the digital and technical side through various models that are being tested in Europe, because we believe we could reach agreements with companies.\u201d In terms of interactivity, this project has an email address (info@newtral.es) that users can write to with their feedback and questions. It is also present on Twitter (104,706 followers), Facebook (7,961 followers), and Instagram (13,700 followers). In addition, aware of the reach of WhatsApp, the team provides responses on this application (682589664) to enquiries, questions and submissions by any member of the public wanting to check information, even including ordinary everyday matters. \u201cSince we launched the initiative, we\u2019ve responded to more than 4,000 fact-check requests via our WhatsApp service. Sometimes the fact-checking takes a while, but we try to respond to everything we can,\u201d explains Gonzalo. The initiative has a rectification policy and is committed to checking information as often as necessary.  3.3. Pagella Politica This platform was established in October 2012 as an online service specialising in fact-checking. It is described on its website as \u201cthe only Italian website dedicated to political fact-checking\u201d, whose objective \u201cis to inject a dose of objectivity into the Italian political dialectic.\u201d It is incorporated as an independent limited partnership, operating under the business name Pagella Politica Srls. The initiative was created as a voluntary, self-financed project by its 10 founders: Pietro Curatolo, Daniele De Bernardin, Federica Fusi, Giorgio Gagnor, Amerigo Lombardi, Alexios Mantzarlis, Flavia Mi, Andrea Saviolo, Silvia Sommariva and Carlo Starace. None of these members has a background in journalism, as their professional experience has been mainly in areas of the social sciences, such as law, political science, economics and international relations. Seven other people also currently form part of the project: the company\u2019s director, Giovanni Zagni, full-time editors Carlo Canepa, Tommaso Canetta, Silvia Cavasola, Alessandro Ciapetti and Camilla Vagnozzi, and two contributors, Davide De Luca and Andrea Zitelli, who are assigned specific projects. \u201cOur team is cross-functional, diverse and of all ages,\u201d explains Pietro Curatolo. \n31  The most common types of news that are fact-checked by Pagella Politica are election promises, interviews and debates, statements by politicians and public figures, and data cited in the media or in speeches. They also fact-check content disseminated on social networks that is submitted by users. Along with their regular activity, the company also participates in a number of international partnerships. \u201cWe are an active part of an international fact-checking community and we\u2019re recognised for not supporting any political candidate or taking sides in political and economic issues,\u201d asserts Curatolo. With respect to their work method, the team analyses statements made by public figures by means of enhanced texts with supports like original sources and graphics. \u201cWe compile statements by constantly monitoring Italy\u2019s major newspapers and magazines, both in print and online, as well as the most important news agencies, politicians\u2019 websites and Twitter accounts, the websites of the national political parties, ministries and government departments, and YouTube. We choose only those statements based on verifiable facts or numbers,\u201d adds Curatolo. The team includes all the links to the article or video in question to allow anyone to verify what was said. In confirming the information as true or false, they always cite the sources on which they base their assessments. \u201cIn this way, nobody can tell us that we\u2019ve misinterpreted the available data,\u201d he adds. The fact-checks are presented on a five-level colour-coded scale, beginning with dark green (\u201cvero\u201d, or true), followed by a lighter green(\u201cc'eri quasi\u201d, or kind of true), while third and fourth place are yellow (\u201cNi\u201d) and orange (\u201cPinocchio andante\u201d). The final level is indicated with the colour red, for content labelled as \u201cPanzana pazzesca\u201d (wild, outrageous lie) (Image 3). Image 3. Information fact-checked by Pagella Politica \nSource: https://pagellapolitica.it/ Pagella Politica\u2019s financing model involves partnerships with newspapers, radio and television networks and training institutes, which \u201chas made it possible to hire employees to look after other more specific projects and services,\u201d explains Pietro Curatolo. Moreover, the members and partners continue contributing voluntarily to managing the site and drafting the fact-checks published on it. Since 2015, Pagella Politica has also been engaging in crowdfunding campaigns on the Kickstarter website. And in 2018, the Italian television network RAI, the AGI news agency and Facebook represented approximately 70% of its revenue.  The remaining 30% came from financing obtained through the EU\u2019s SOMA project, for winning a call for proposals under the European Commission\u2019s Horizon 2020 programme. Pagella Politica is one of five members of this project, which also includes Aarhus University (Denmark), the Athens Technology Centre (Greece), LUISS Guido Carli University (Italy) and Ecosistemas T6 (Italy). The initiative is currently involved in weekly collaborations with programmes on RAI2, and it conducts five fact-checks a week for the Italian journalists\u2019 agency (Agenzia Giornalistica Italia). It also provides Facebook with support to combat the dissemination of fake news on the platform and writes a fact-checking column for the bimonthly magazine La Pagella di Bruxelles. \u201cThanks to our clients, we keep the political reporting system alive by spending nearly all our earnings on company salaries and administration,\u201d explains Curatolo. \n32  The Italian initiative is present on Twitter (11,934 followers), Facebook (31,624 followers) and, since December 2018, on Instagram (850 followers). Via these platforms users can submit feedback and content for fact-checking. In addition, its website offers the facility to fact-check a statement using the \u201csubmit a statement\u201d button, and there is an RSS subscription service that allows users to receive alerts. At the end of each post there is a unique feature that allows users to share the fact-check in question on social networks. The initiative also has a policy on corrections, adjustments and updates, which allows it to modify and update any of its publications.  4. Analysis of results 4.1. Features, professional profiles and work methodology The interviews conducted for this research support the assertion in the academic literature that these types of initiatives have been created in response to the constant acceleration of the news cycle as a consequence of the dissemination of information online. The objectives of these projects also reflect their design and capacity for scalability (Carvajal, 2015). Maril\u00edn Gonzalo, coordinator of the digital area at Newtral Media Audiovisual, remarks that \u201cthe team\u2019s aspiration is to serve as a benchmark in fact-checking\u201d while Maldito Bulo\u2019s scalability is revealed in its objective to promote media literacy and technological tools that can create a community capable of defending itself against disinformation. Pagella Politica also has a clear vision of the role it seeks to play: to inject a dose of objectivity into the Italian political dialectic, as it affirms on its website. Another phenomenon given considerable attention in the academic literature and supported by the case studies analysed here is the profile of the professionals who perform these tasks. On this point, all three projects analysed support the argument that the success of these initiatives requires a flexible, multidisciplinary team with specific technological skills that enable them to implement their business plan. At Maldito Bulo, for example, data journalists, IT engineers and developers of web platforms and mobile applications all work together. At Newtral Media Audiovisual there are journalists, engineers, researchers, programmers, producers, filmmakers, graphic artists and documentalists, while at Pagella Politica there are journalists and specialists in law, political science, economics and international relations. The profile of the journalist is redefined in these projects as a flexible professional with a multitude of specialisations and skills and with the capacity to work alongside others with very different profiles to pursue their work objectives. All of this is combined with an open, innovative attitude that views the changes affecting the media industry as opportunities rather than potential threats. It is worth noting that a common trend in recent years among news professionals has been to leave traditional media for digital native projects, and then to leave those projects to launch their own news media start-ups (Valero & Gonz\u00e1lez, 2018). This points to a shift in the professional profiles and structures of these initiatives towards one of the essential features of successful media companies: the flexibility to embrace constant evolution while minimising risks and costs, with multidisciplinary work teams (K\u00fcng, 2017). The initiatives analysed here are all similar in terms of the type of content they fact-check. All three projects focus on political statements, information circulating on social networks and suggestions submitted by users. All three also employ similar methods for fact-checking the information in terms of the features of the content published and the media used to disseminate it. All three organizations also refer to primary and official sources to begin their fact-checking processes. On the other hand, the techniques and materials used vary from one company to the next. Newtral Audiovisual Media, for example, employs experts who help to contextualise and understand the information, while at Maldito Bulo and Pagella Politica nobody outside the team participates; instead, it is the team members themselves who vote and decide whether the checks made should be published or not. There are also differences in the formulas used to indicate the degree of accuracy of the information checked. Maldito Bulo and Newtral Media Audiovisual both use a textual explanation and a scale of accuracy based on the independent or combined use of terms, colours and symbols to present their fact-checking to the public. On the other hand, Pagella Politica only combines two elements in its fact-checking: a textual explanation and a term-based and colour-coded scale, without the use of any other visual elements.  4.2. Business model and user interactivity The initiatives studied here were all created in the context of what is known as \u201centrepreneurial journalism\u201d (Manfredi, Rojas & Herranz, 2015; Prenger & Deuze, 2017), as they advocate a return to the traditional values of the trade, principles like truth, rigour, ethics, public service and independence, through the creation of 33  models that differ substantially from traditional media models. They also involve a massive reduction in the level of investment needed for news production (Manfredi & Artero, 2014). In view of this, it could be argued that not only do these companies pursue individual profit for their creators, but also, in their quest for a model that will help them to generate and capture value, they are compelled to heed community demands to meet certain needs. They are innovative projects because instead of trying to maintain the existing analogue model, they are digital by nature, which means greater flexibility, dynamism and speed in their capacity for adaptation to change. All three projects constitute clear examples of the business and production strategies employed in the field of fact-checking. They are organisations that operate as independent media companies, despite the fact that their employees are increasingly partnering with other media outlets. Maldito Bulo partners with the radio networks Onda Cero and RNE, the news service eldiario.es and the TV network Telemadrid, while Newtral Audiovisual Media works with the laSexta and Telemadrid networks, and Pagella Politica with Agenzia Giornalistica Italia (AGI) and the Italian television network RAI. Other sources of revenue include grants (Maldito Bulo) and assistance from EU projects (Pagella Politica). In relation to sources of revenue, it is also important to highlight the fact that Maldito Bulo, Newtral and Pagella Politica have all been hired by Facebook to combat fake news on its platform, giving them the mission to review content (texts, photos and videos) that users or the platform itself has determined may potentially be false or manipulated or contain information that is misleading or presented out of context. The projects work independently of Facebook in checking this content, although they are paid for the service. Diversification of revenue sources is therefore possible in entrepreneurial journalism, but a business plan or \u201clean canvas\u201d (Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2009) is needed to deal with issues like cost structure and initial financing. Another issue analysed is the interactivity these initiatives offer their communities of followers. All three have a large number of followers and users on social networks. Twitter is the social network where they have the biggest numbers of followers: Maldito Bulo with 225,804, Newtral Media Audiovisual with 104,706 and Pagella Politica with 11,934. The professionals working on these projects exploit their active participation on social networks to project their personal brand of journalism to thousands of followers in the new global media environment, using it as a means of promotion (Manfredi, 2015). These communities of followers, meanwhile, also provide the initiatives with content, as they use these instant messaging tools to submit topics for fact-checking.

Discussion and conclusions This research has effectively met its proposed objective to analyse the structure, composition and operation of independent fact-checking platforms in Spain and Italy. The fact that only three initiatives qualified for study\u2014Maldito Bulo, Newtral Audiovisual Media, and Pagella Politica\u2014reflects the reality that despite the growth of interest in the practice of fact-checking in recent years, many of these kinds of projects have not enjoyed the continuity needed to grow. All three projects studied were established between 2012 and 2018, during the greatest boom in the fact-checking phenomenon. Since then, they have continued to personalise their services in order to generate and capture value and respond to the demands of media companies and users who want news stories that have been checked against reliable sources, official documents and sound research results, at a time when the journalistic profession is seriously affected by job insecurity (Fole, 2012; G\u00f3mez, Guti\u00e9rrez & Palau-Sampio, 2015; \u00c1lvarez & L\u00f3pez, 2016; L\u00f3pez, Rodr\u00edguez & \u00c1lvarez, 2016). These findings provide evidence of the interest in consolidating this service to the public, which prioritises the civic agenda and the monitoring of public authorities, in a post-truth era when fake news is undermining the quality standards and credibility of the media and of journalists (Lewandowsky, Ecker & Cook, 2017). Indeed, G\u00f3mez, Roses & Garc\u00eda (2017) argue that the most promising employment niches for the near future are those related to the new possibilities offered by the digital environment, as these new spaces offer a context for a hybridisation of elements of traditional journalism with virtual tools. Based on this study, it is possible to conclude that the fact-checking process involves a hybridisation of profiles and a cross-section of knowledge, skills and attitudes (Hypothesis 1). This situation points to a need to develop new skills adapted to the impact of technological innovation, as suggested by Besal\u00fa, Schena & S\u00e1nchez (2017) and by Casero-Ripoll\u00e9s, Ortells & Dom\u00e9nech (2013). Fact-checkers need to be proficient in multimedia communication and in different formats, as they may have to deal with data and information of different kinds\u2014video, audio, photographs, text\u2014that they will have to know how to integrate into their news production. The political statements and information circulating on social networks constitute the kind of content that is fact-checked the most by all three organisations studied. Thanks to the use of traditional techniques like searching documentary archives and the use of technological applications (Brandtzaeg et al., 2018), it is possible to check and verify data, images or other documents providing information. The objective of all this is to confirm that information or, if applicable, debunk it by clarifying where the inaccuracies are and furnishing original data that support an accurate representation of the facts. This fact-checking is presented to the audience in the form of textual explanations and verification scales based on terms, visual elements and colours (Hypothesis 2). These companies help revitalise the news industry with their quest for new business models, and thus represent a radically different view from the approach of traditional companies in recent years in terms of the information products they offer the market. The main sources of financing for these initiatives are partnerships with different media companies, social networks and other platforms (Hypothesis 3). Hypothesis 4 has also been confirmed by this study, as the fact-checkers, like professionals working in other areas of journalism, have adopted social networks as tools to support their daily work activities, using them for checking facts and accessing original sources as well as disseminating the information products resulting from their fact-checking processes and for subsequent contact and discussion with their followers and with the general public. In line with these observations, Bremer (2013) notes that proficiency in the use of social networks can enhance the employability of future journalism graduates, as many young people have difficulties finding work due to the mismatch between their qualifications and the needs of the labour market. This first study does not represent an exhaustive examination of the issue examined here; on the contrary, the study itself underscores the fact that it is an active and evolving topic for discussion. Although this research has confirmed all four of its starting hypotheses, it suffers from certain limitations and leaves a number of questions open for further research. A wider sample would have facilitated the identification of more features that could be extrapolated to the market as a whole, while the inclusion of initiatives from other parts of the world could allow for a comparative study between the Spanish case and those of other countries. This is not to suggest that the results of this research are invalid, as it is essentially a qualitative rather than quantitative study. Finally, with respect to future research in this area, there is considerable room for the development of similar studies in order to analyse the particular features and tendencies of fact-checking initiatives. The performance of further research could result in a better understanding of this practice and serve to assess the value of organisations and individual researchers working in the field of fact-checking. 35  6.

Introduction  The figure of Carles Puigdemont, President of the Catalan Government (Spain) between 2016 and 2017, is of special interest for political communication. His election as President in an urgently convened parliamentary session (on 10 January 2016) and his persistence in calling a unilateral independence referendum have converted him into a recurrent political figure in the crisis of the European Union (Politico, 2018). Puigdemont, a journalist by profession, is well acquainted with how public opinion is manipulated and has known how to convey a clear message (\u2018Volem votar\u2019) in order to mobilize Catalan social actors in favor of greater self-rule and maybe even the region\u2019s legal separation from Spain. Since the events of October 2017, Puigdemont has been a fugitive from Spanish justice. For some Catalans, Puigdemont is a hero of the cause for independence. The secessionists have resorted to many different digital platforms and associative networks to get their message across (Ordeix & Ginesta, 2014). For others, the former president is a traitor who has betrayed the Spanish Constitution\u2014although it should be noted that before 18 March 2018, this constitutionalist group had done little to defend the unity of Spain and its constitution. But both groups have leveraged social networking sites (SNSs), consolidating polarized ideas and discourses, to convey their messages. This situation of political uncertainty begs the question of how important developments are framed on SNSs. Thus, the question that this study poses is whether or not SNSs have the ability to change radically the perception of a public figure due to an unconfirmed news story. To analyze this question about political leadership, real or fake news and the shaping of public figures, the echo that the aforementioned political developments had on SMSs from 26 to 27 October, the most crucial dates, is analyzed here. In the first section, the narrative of the hero in political communication and how this has evolved towards populism will be reviewed. In particular, what is of interest here is the conception of this narrative and its reworking on SMSs. In the second section, the method of analysis and the value of SMSs as tools for studying the framing of the secessionists and the collapse of the narrative of the hero in the wake of the failed referendum will be described. In the third section, the behavior of SMS users in relation to the reaction of the media, as well as the capacity that both possess to unify real and fake news, will be examined. And lastly, the results and conclusions will be discussed.  2. The narrative of the hero in political communication The hero possesses the same attributes in the universal literature, for instance, he is \u2018a person who is admired for their courage, outstanding achievements or noble qualities\u2019 (The Oxford Dictionary, 2017). According to Encyclopaedia Britannica (2016), the hero is the main character in a story due to his skills, strengths and courage. Heroism is rooted in tragedy, that is, the moral mandate that obliges heroes to champion causes that they believe are just. It is not a romantic tragedy because the struggle for the common good holds the promise of certain victory. Heroes cannot renounce their mandate and that is why they ultimately take action. They defy the powers that be (Figure 1) thanks to the extraordinary qualities that they possess and manage to persuade those around them (de la Torre, 2010). The relationship between heroism and populism is of a performative and aesthetic nature (Moffit & Tormey, 2014): the action and discourse modify the public\u2019s subjective interpretation. Puigdemont has portrayed himself as a \u2018saviour\u2019 (del Rey Morat\u00f3, 2007: 226) playing a leading role in all the political developments in Catalonia. As a result, he has become (for some) a celebrity of its cause for independence (Becker, 2013). The circumstance that have made it possible are based on political attitude: he became the President and promoted the referendum against the Spanish law. He managed personal social media accounts to show disobedience crafting a self-image of rebel (Figure 1). He has a defiant approach to political response coming from central government and judicial power, because the leader from the former referendum in 2014 were prosecuted. Puigdemont developed a hero narrative drawing an institutional distrust environment -including Spain and the European Union institutions \u2013 where his commitment represents direct democracy, and the voice of the people. Indeed, during the summer 2017, some members of the cabinet decided not to continue in office fearing judicial consequences of the referendum. That was a tipping point to divide between \"distress\" and \"fearless\" political leaders committed to be the founding fathers of the new republic. The second aspect is the quest for the common good, a limitless show of generosity and courage. Come hell or high water, the hero pursues a promise of victory. It is a virtuous heroism that strives to and can change the course of events. The hero acts as social glue rallying the people around an impossible cause or symbolic action. Puigdemont is an example of how the public narrative is constructed. Largely unknown to the general public, despite the fact that he was the mayor of Girona when he stepped forward to champion the cause, he was named president unexpectedly and by accident.   43 The third point is the recognition of the other, the antagonist who the hero (Puigdemont) encounters along the way before reaching his ultimate objective. The former president gives social conflicts semantic meaning (Ver\u00f3n, 1985) when he points to a Catalan demos at odds with the rest of Spain. For Mouffe (2000), under populism the friendly antagonist shares the same symbolic and public space, although he disagrees with how political order should be instituted. Rather than seeking a consensus inherent to liberal democracy, the intention is to trigger a confrontation between political orders based on the desire for action. Under this context, Puigdemont\u2019s social media management explore direct reach with the independence cause, using public service media against plural voices, promoting web, apps and hashtags to construct the \u201chero\u201d image against big powers. In particular, Twitter multiplied his digital exposition.  Figure 1: Puigdemont, a rebel against the Constitutional \n The antagonist should not be confused with the traitor, that person who sacrifices the common good or cause for personal gain. Although the hero can become a traitor if he changes the destiny of those around him or renounces an exemplary behavior for the cause (Figure 2). Gallardo-Pa\u00fals (2016: 89) notes that the Internet user has an \u2018almost exhibitionist\u2019 will and the network\u2019s discourse is \u2018essentially monological, self-centered and egocentric\u2019. The exhibitionist approach fits with the hyper-leadership style favored by Puigdemont. Consequently, he tends to make undiplomatic statements, rejects media outlets as mediators and oversimplifies complex analyses. Figure 2: Rufi\u00e1n breaking the hero frame \n The last element involves tailoring a narrative without scientific rigor or conceptual precision. Reason, legality or facticity collapsed; legitimating conspiracy theories breed for pro-independence audiences. It is an epic narrative that places the accent on action, rather than on reflection or on the consequences of the decisions made. The hero acts on an ethical impulse. The undesired repercussions affect the hero\u2019s reputation and the success of his mission. The former president bases his political activity on agitation on SNSs and through social movements which have retweeted his messages to such an extent that he has created his own information ecosystem. Hallin (2019) believes that this new media ecology is essential in the mediatization of populism:  \n 44 In which the traditional media and traditional journalistic profession are no longer central to the flow of information in the way they were through the last decades of the twentieth century. It is a fragmented structure, in which different segments of the population are exposed to different facts, different spectra of opinion and different ideas about the legitimate boundaries of political discourse\u2019 (2018: 8). The populist hero prefers huge demonstrations and multitudinous events organized around his figure and his cause, in line with other populists (de la Torre, 2017). Thus, Puigdemont has used the public service media, which are directly accountable to the Catalan government itself, to promote a vision of the Catalan question. He belittles the journalistic work of those who criticise his style of political management and representation and employs the media in the same way as other populist leaders: \u2018Twitter has been another platform for populist presidents to berate and harass critics. [\u2026] Presidential tweets patently reflect populism\u2019s antagonistic speech and \u201chostile media\u201d attitude\u2019 (Waisbord & Amado, 2017: 1341). He avails himself of public spaces to magnify his discourse. He denounces the \u2018injustice\u2019 with which he is being hounded for \u2018political reasons\u2019. And he wants to return to Barcelona, but fears retribution. These are the perfect ingredients with which to construct a message of heroism that dovetails with the polarization of Catalan society (CEO, 2018; Generalitat de Catalunya, 2017). Figure 3: Catalan Elections results (21st December 2017) \nThe political hero takes the shape of a populist leader, a vague concept that operates on four levels: appeals to the people, anti-pluralism because society is homogeneous, access to power and attacks on the institutional liberal order (de la Torre, 2010; M\u00fcller, 2016). In political communication, the construction of the narrative of the hero is a rhetorical and stylistic resource that is resorted to during electoral campaigns, social mobilisations and \u2018political affectivity\u2019 (Arias Maldonado, 2016). As stated above, the role of social media in today\u2019s news media environment contributed to profile Puigdemont as a leader of the cause, a state-man, not a traditional politician. The self-image signals the consolidation of a united nation stigmatizing pluralism. Under the circumstances of digital narrative, Puigdemont\u2019s attitude fits with the conspiracy theories, where Spanish and European institutions work together against the Catalan independence. Attacking these institutions (Figure 1) he sends a message of \u201cCatalan people\u201d unity against the foreign institutions. As other populist leaders, Puigdemont neglects trust in media, as social media structure his own message without intermediaries.  Populism is identified with a leadership style revolving almost exclusively around the figure of the president, an antagonistic discourse and an obsession for media coverage (Waisbord & Amado, 2017: 1331). Populism is based on the power of persuasion of the political message that identifies a number of neglected social demands (independence), a victim (the good Catalans) and a leader (the former president himself) who is a hero because he has had the courage to confront the institutions. On SNSs, this behavioural pattern is repeated to gain visibility and buttress the presidential position: \u2018They have used the platform to bolster presidential communication just as they have done by resorting to media management tactics such as the frequent, long presidential national broadcast and press conferences with friendly journalists\u2019 (Waisbord & Amado, 2017: 1344). The political information cycle accelerates and blurs the boundaries between instantaneous messages (memes) and confirmed news, between information professionals and propagandists. In this context, the challenges are information leaks, the attribution of importance and the contextualisation of political information (Casero, 2018: 965). Puigdemont\u2019s media activity apes that of classic populism. The vindication \u2018Volem votar\u2019 is an example of the \u2018empty signifier\u2019 (Laclau, 2005: 269) which encompasses all demands and acts as a tenuous link between different actors and social groups. For de Blasio and Sorice, exercising the right to vote is in tune with this exogenous dimension of political responsibility: \n 45 The same rhetoric on direct democracy tends to restore a principle of aggregation (as in Madison\u2019s conceptions of the representative method); it is no coincidence that populist movements and parties tend to reject the logic of participatory democracy or the methods of deliberation. This logic is sometimes rejected due to the presumed efficiency of technologies for the improvement of democracy. Considering the continuous and responsible participation of everyone, these movements prefer the episodic and decisive exercise of the referendum (the use of judicial or electoral instruments within representative democracies) (2018: 3). The logic of representation at a referendum level dovetails with the mediated construction of reality by public figures who are worthy of the confidence of voters. They are authentic insofar as they connect with the emotions of SNS users (Enli, 2017).   3. Research method, questions and hypothesis From 1 to 27 October 2017, Puigdemont became the champion of the Catalan cause, a turn of events that has converted him into one of the noteworthy figures in recent history. He managed to call and carry through a unilateral referendum and declare the independence of Catalonia off his own bat\u2014although this declaration was shortly suspended. These political decisions, contrary to Spanish constitutional doctrine, converted him into the hero of the new republic. However, on 26 October, a leak implying that he had had a change of heart and had made a political volte-face converted him into a traitor for 24 hours on the same SNSs that he had leveraged during his term in office. What was important was not the actual leak (which was false, since regional elections had not been called), but the fact that such a call might have been envisaged. The journalist Enric Juliana clearly describes the frenetic activity on 26 October as \u2018the traitors\u2019 press conference\u2019 (2018a, 2018b). Santi Vila, a regional councilor and the only politician to have resigned after the unilateral declaration of independence, conceptualizes the idea of heroes and traitors in the regional cabinet in an identical fashion (2018). Accordingly, the aim of this study is to determine how Puigdemont was converted from a hero into a traitor on SNSs and how he subsequently salvaged his prestige among those in favor of independence. It underscores the volatility of the secessionist frame, the viralisation of polarized messages and the credibility (or not) of the conventional media. The study\u2019s theoretical framework is supported by the academic literature and, more recently, by the experiments conducted by Shulman and Sweitzer (2017: 238), who have demonstrated that \u2018in a political context, novel political events or issues arise all the time, and when this happens, people are expected to arrive at a judgment even if little available information exists\u2019. Their study is \u2018optimistic\u2019 as regards the relationship between ideology, attitudes and the processing of new information. While other authors hold that such activity is simulated, a sort of \u2018controlled interactivity\u2019 (Stromer-Galley, 2014). Finally, the question of time management a news media environment emerges as key argument. Bodker and Anderson (2019) explain how the populist communication style needs \u201cpolitics of impatience\u201d, where Twitter creates a so-called \u201cpopulist time\u201d. The notion includes a real-time approach to every news, the intense disintermediation based on the leaders\u2019 charisma and followers, and the impulsivity to share pre-politics messages based on values rather than in more elaborated ideas or viewpoints. The research question is as follows: as Puigdemont characterized himself as a hero of the independence, can media impact partisan audience?  Three hypotheses are put forward: H1. Partisan audiences are not interested in facts, when the political leader is considered a hero. Information disseminated through SNSs connect to two pre-existing polarized frames (secessionist and constitutionalist vote) H2. The hero narrative signals political communication populism, and it needs more tweets than facts. Facts are less relevant as media repeat leaders\u2019 message. Under this condition, to develop a hyper-leader profile is an strategic activity in political communication.  H3. Fact-based discourse is less interesting than the conversation itself. Digital conversations in social networks is based on news media. However, the media shaped the conversation, although they were not the \u2018reading\u2019 source.     46 3.1. Research design Framing is one of the most popular political communication research techniques (L\u00f3pez & Pav\u00eda, 2018). In the classic definition proposed by Entman, \u2018To frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described\u2019 (Entman 1993: 52). And for their part, Chong and Druckman (2007) note that the presentation of public affairs influences their comprehension. Frames do not operate in a vacuum, but reinforce the predisposition of individuals. Framing is a method that \u2018essentially involves selection and salience\u2019 (Entman, 1993: 52). It has been used here to select the keywords that organise ideas and convey values, thus transmitting information inasmuch as this determines whether or not an event is newsworthy (Matthes & Kohring, 2008), and to make them more salient in order to identify the characteristics of such an event and to correlate some attributes with others. For Howard et al. (2011), grouping words serves to complete datasets, to map the relationship between the actors and to broaden lines of analysis. In both techniques, the author of the message, the sources quoted and the genre employed are identified. The authors of messages are relevant when the intention is to determine the importance of the conversation, regardless of whether they are the most mentioned users or the ones to whom most attention is paid by others. At this point, it is convenient to distinguish between institutionalised actors (political parties, associations, groups, etc.) and individuals. The two techniques are present in individual (tweets) and social discourses (the media). A semantic content analysis reflects the hybrid media ecosystem and the distribution of power (Chadwick, 2013: 208): \u2018The hybrid media system exhibits a balance between the older logics of transmission and reception and the newer logics of circulation, recirculation, and negotiation\u2019. Hashtag frequency and content illustrate the relationship between social media, news outlets and the powers that be, whether they be newspapers or political institutions. In the conventional press, the selection of frames is a technique that establishes a \u2018set of interpretative packages\u2019, from which editorial values and lines can be deduced. Internal structures of values and emotions, which are not only rational, play a role in the selection of individual frames. For Kahneman (2003), individual judgement not only draws on emotions but also on rational cognitive capacities. And, according to Shulman and Sweitzer (2017), the selection of simple frames increases the level of political commitment and the effectiveness of civic initiatives. In contrast, the variables and interactions that influence the process of constructing meanings multiply on SNSs. The conversation\u2019s degree of centrality and the actors\u2019 specific importance in the creation of ideas, the standardization of hashtags and the evolution of conceptual trends are also assessed. Puigdemont\u2019s portray as a hero or a traitor (Figure 6) is not based on the references and messages sent via Twitter. Figure 8 shows how media participate in the conversation, shaping the topics and the frame: audience\u2019s tweets are connected to television brands (Al Rojo Vivo, M\u00e1s Vale Tarde). Twitter provides an intermediate frame because it combines individual emotions (user-generated content) with journalistic messages (media message sharing). It is an arbitrary frame more prone to polarization than to viralisation. In the negotiation of meanings, categories and discourses, a negotiation of authority and influence is observed. Alfred Hermida notes: Established elites transfer their institutional power to social media. But they operate alongside emergent, networked-sourced nodes of influence as ad hoc publics elevate certain actors on specific issues at specific times, within specific contexts and domains. A greater understanding of what forms of power play out on social media is essential to illuminating processes of networked gatekeeping, networked framing, and networked sourcing (2015: 2). The tool for creating intermediate frames is the hashtag, keywords included in messages that serve to beat the algorithm in order to gain visibility, focus the conversation and engage with the community. In the case of populism, public discourse activates a range of values and basic sentiments. The hero, as the traitor, is dualized in antithetical values. As figure 4 and 5 shows, the binary image is clear: legal and law/people\u2019 voice; free elections/collaborator; Spain/National Catalan Assembly; and so on. Activating the discourse prefigures indulgence attitudes to not accurate information, and no fact-based evidence. Hashtags are an effective way of generating social conversations on matters of common concern, without geographical or language barriers. They are also instrumenting of political commitment that require a minimum effort in exchange for highlighting participation in a cause. There is already plenty of scientific literature that has employed hashtags as a way of identifying conversations on social media and analysing salience (Thorson et al., 2016; Gerbaudo, 2012; Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Jung, & Valenzuela, 2012). For Rambukkana (2013), hashtags ambiguously represent a semantic diversity inherent to hybrid information systems:  47 Hashtags are hybrids in the taxonomy of types of information. They are both text and metatext, information and tag, pragmatic and metapragmatic speech. They are deictic, indexical\u2014yet what they point to is themselves, their own dual role in ongoing discourse\u2019 (2013:1).  In the Catalan context (Rodon, Martori, & Cuadros, 2018), there is a recurrent use of hashtags to frame the debate on sovereignty: #apunt conveys messages in favour of independence, while #diada conveys institutional or constitutionalist messages. In the same vein, Ballesteros remarks:  In a symbolic fashion, if geographical frontiers do not yet separate nations of law, they do indeed seem to determine de facto information nations characterized by their tendency to offer their own incompatible interpretations of political processes per se\u2019 (2015: 180). Keywords filter content and broaden the scope of tweets. Doing so, Twitter became the public sphere for a large number of partisan voters. The platform articulates the sense of participatory culture, where public opinion, politicians and social movements coordinate protests. However, the choice of words and\u2014by extension\u2014the expression of the intrinsic values of users are less frequent. It is in this research context that this study makes sense. Partisan voters are polarized and engage through ingenious hashtags devoted to mix political issues, news, facts, and opinion (Figure 7).  3.2. Data gathering and sample This study, typical of social science research through the prism of \u2018Internet time\u2019 (Karpf, 2012) and social sciences and big data (Gonz\u00e1lez-Bail\u00f3n, 2013), is innovative insofar as it analyses live data: people tweet and update information on a daily basis, creating new hashtags and displaying new behaviours. The results, rather than static, are ever-changing. The Politics Buzz tool was employed to gather data between 8 am on 26 October and 8 am on 27 October. All the messages were retrieved from Twitter, Facebook, digital forums or conventional news outlets. The study universe included 23,225 units, 94% of which were retrieved from SNSs. There were no geographical limits, but there were indeed language restraints: the messages selected were in Spanish, Catalan, English and Italian, a country where the Catalan issue has aroused huge interest (Juliana, 2017). Specifically, 94.54% of the messages were written in Spanish, followed by English (2.67%), Catalan (only 2.42%) and Italian (0.36%). A Boolean search was employed to identify keywords on any SNSs or conventional news outlet with an online presence, while truncation was used to identify hashtags (tags) and trending topics, content shared and individual authors. A significant number of exclusions was established (by means of AND NOT) with an eye to eliminating false positives unrelated to the object of study. The search was performed on the descriptor \u2018traitor\u2019 in the four aforementioned languages: traido*, traici*, trait*, tra\u00efdo* or tra\u00efci\u00f3*.  4. Result The search yielded 23,225 unique results. Disaggregated by keyword, the first was \u2018traido*\u2019, with 11,910 results, followed by \u2018traici*\u2019 with 9,587, together representing 92.55% of the total. For their part, the Catalan keywords (tra\u00efdo* or tra\u00efci\u00f3*) accounted for 9.41% of the search results. By theme, the cloud shown below (Figure 4) offers a visual representation of the importance of each one of the keywords. \u2018Puigdemont\u2019 was the most repeated keyword (8,703 results), although \u2018traici\u00f3n\u2019 was mentioned on 15,694 occasions. This was followed by the two burning political issues at the time: the application of \u2018Article 155\u2019 and \u2018elections\u2019 with 3,843 and 3,419 references, respectively. Figure 4: Puigdemont, framed as traitor \n \n 48 In the tag cloud shown below (Figure 5), the font size represents the importance of the 212,729 messages retrieved with the tool. Figure 5: Tag cloud (the greater the font size, the greater the importance) \n #duiinminenteesp (Espejo P\u00fablico, Antena 3) and #Arvcat (Al Rojo Vivo, La Sexta), the conversation\u2019s most relevant hashtags, referred to news programme content broadcast before midday. La Sexta\u2019s hashtag #reuniongovernarv figured among the most cited twice, the digital reality being more important than the audio-visual content per se, i.e. users continued to share the hashtag, even though it did not now have anything to do with the content originally broadcast by the channel. These were followed by #ppsoe, representing the traditional stance of the two-party system in Spain, a hashtag with negative connotations since it portrayed the two parties as part and parcel of the political establishment, without drawing any distinctions. At a third level, there were hashtags relating to the process, such as #republicaara, #barcelona, #dui, #llibertadjordis and #traidores. And, lastly, the hashtags #diaduim4 (Las ma\u00f1anas de Cuatro, Cuatro) and #elsmatinstv3 (Els matins, TV3), the former relating to a programme with the fifth largest audience share and the latter to one broadcast entirely in Catalan, in which context it is indeed a benchmark. Table 1.

The time distribution of activity shows a peak between 12.11 am and 4 pm, when the news about the election call was leaked and the initial reactions of political and social actors were registered. During those four hours, Puigdemont was associated with political betrayal: the idea that he had renounced his political goals and had accepted the terms and conditions of the central government went viral. When the election call was denied at 5 pm, the viral bubble burst. The conversation on SNSs corresponds to the timing of the events. The President convened a press conference at 1.30 pm to call elections, but delayed his appearance twice, until the news that he was not going to do so was leaked at around 3 pm. At that moment, the perception of betrayal began to fade and the frame disappeared. This evolution is also comparable with that observed in Figures 7 and 8, with #republicaara and #traidores peaking between 1 and 2 pm, before vanishing.      \n 49 Figure 6. Evolution of topics over time (query: traido, traici, tra\u00efci\u00f3, tra\u00efdo, trait) \n Figure 7. Evolution of hashtags over time \n Figure 8. Evolution of hashtags relating to the unilateral declaration of independence \n In relation to the distribution of content, Twitter accounted for 72.3% of the messages, the result of combining the 15,767 tweets, 67.9% of which went viral. Facebook came in second place with 5.155 posts, representing 23.6% of the total, followed by ForoCoches, with 296 posts (1.4%), the rest being symbolic (2.8%). These figures are equivalent to an estimated potential audience of 362.5 million unique users. \n 50 The results for the conventional media were comparatively lower, with 1,403 posts accounting for 6% of online activity. A qualitative perspective is essential in a rapidly changing media environment in which an increasingly more intensive use is being made of SNSs (Karpf et al., 2015: 1899). Thus, the 10 topics that generated the greatest amount of discussion through retweets (RTs), comments, shares, etc., will now be described below, since they include references to political leaders and news agencies and outlets. These topics generated 21,932 interactions distributed non-linearly. The first 25 accounted for 32,924 unique users, while those occupying from 26th to 50th place only represented 6,889. The 10 most shared topics included seven references to conventional news outlets, a news agency, a political party and a Catalan deputy. El Pa\u00eds was the news outlet leading the conversation with two related news stories. The first was an item in its \u2018latest live news\u2019 section with 3,971 interactions of all types. The most important of these occurred at 12.19 am with the announcement that President Puigdemont was willing to call elections. The second newsworthy event was the publication of a book on Catalan history by the British historian and Hispanist John H. Elliot, with 1,934 interactions, primarily in the account of the journalist responsible for the story. While the second media outlet was P\u00fablico, a benchmark left-wing publication in Spain. The item published in the newspaper\u2019s \u2018breaking news\u2019 section, associating the events in Catalonia with a resurgence of Francoism, totalled 3,678 interactions with Julian Assange standing out as a node centralising these concerns. The third reference was Gabriel Rufi\u00e1n, a Catalan MP with a seat in the Congress of Deputies. His tweet created a clear frame that identified the traitors with the stillborn Catalan Republic, owing to the application of Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution. The traitors were members of the regional government who were unwilling to violate Spanish laws. On 24 October, Rufi\u00e1n posted a second tweet on the \u2018heroic mandate\u2019 emerging from the events of 1 October, with 996 interactions. The Spanish news agency Europa Press, coming in fourth place, covered the legal developments and enforceability of the measures provided for in Article 155. For its part, Cadena SER, the radio station with the largest audience in Spain, contributed with two news stories, one political of its own making (1,970 interactions) and another with statements issued by the leader of the party Ciudadanos Albert Rivera (1,460 interactions). Ahora Podemos, the only political party in the top 10, generated 1,538 interactions with an interview with the Madrid leader Ram\u00f3n Espinar, published in eldiario.es. Lastly, La Vanguardia published two stories, one general and the other with images, figuring among the top 10. It was the only newspaper based in Catalonia that had a specific influence on the global conversation and its news stories were published in Spanish, not in Catalan, despite having a Catalan-language version. Although not in the top 10, the content coming in 12th place posted by Rosa D\u00edez, a political leader without parliamentary representation since 2015, is also worth mentioning. Figure 8.

Twitter emerged as the key channel, both economic and efficient when maximising the dissemination of content on the Web by means of RTs. These RTs are also valuable insofar as they are explicit, intentional and conscious acts of communication (del Fresno, Daly, & Segado, 2016) with the aim of reaching the largest audience possible. Due to its ease of use with mobile technology, Twitter acts as a sort of central nervous system of the Internet and as a means of inserting other media content (Grandjean, 2016). Preliminary studies have revealed the link between political protests and the intensive use of technology as  51 a source of information\u2014not necessarily journalistic\u2014and a form of expressing political ideas and of social mobilisation (Valenzuela 2013; Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga & Valenzuela, 2011; Tucker et al., 2018).  5. Conclusions SNSs have become showcases for political communication revolving around the strong leadership inherent to media populism. They are used to inform and affect the production of internal and external frames. Thanks to their ability to help messages go viral and to establish frames, both the secessionists and constitutionalists have employed the tool with this discursive purpose in mind. Political agents disseminate hashtags in order that digital mobilization should have a real influence on the political agenda. Hashtags organise the digital conversation. Puigdemont\u2019s communication success rely on how conventional television follow his decisions via Twitter, receiving attention and bypassing truth-based news analysis. Audience share his view and decisions, picturing the Catalan leader as a hero of the republic. However, such exposure became fragile frame also because facts are not necessary to sustain a narrative. When other Catalan leaders framed Puigdemont as a traitor (see Figure 2), televisions were forced to report the commentary.  Although media effects are addressed in the academic literature\u2014i.e. framing, priming and agenda-setting studies\u2014there is still no consensus on their real repercussions on political life. Thus, this study has contributed to clarify that SNSs reproduce political communities and create their own meanings in light of the developments. The analysis of the decisive 24 hours from 26 to 27 October 2017 confirm that the messages circulating on SNSs had an impact on the internal and external perception of Puigdemont as a hero or a traitor of the fledgling republic. The 23,225 tweets retrieved under this intellectual frame, later confirmed by journalists and politicians, provide answers to the three hypothesis set out above. In relation to H1, it has been confirmed that the two opposing groups in Catalonia expressed their vision of political reality by means of hashtags. Some framed the decisions made by Puigdemont as his betrayal of the republic, declared on 1 October, with a huge spike in online activity between 12.11 am (when the deputy Rufi\u00e1n posted his tweet) and 4 pm, when it was denied that regional elections had been called, after which the four-hour bubble immediately burst. The constitutionalist group employed \u2018155\u2019 and \u2018elections\u2019 to convey their message at about the same time. In sum, the reality adapted to the pre-established frame and did not operate in a vacuum. H2 has also been borne out. The first unconfirmed news about the election call within the bounds of the constitution triggered a wave of messages revolving around the idea of betrayal. This had a direct effect on the behaviour of Puigdemont, according to the subsequent accounts of journalists and politicians close to the former president. His transformation from a hero into a traitor, observed on SNSs and confirmed in the street, shocked him to the core. He had second thoughts and cancelled the press conference scheduled for 1.30 pm. The word \u2018traitor\u2019 then gradually disappeared on SNSs. This hypothesis is supported by the statements made by Santi Vila, the only member of the Catalan government to have resigned after the unilateral declaration of independence, during his appearance before the High Court. H3 is the most interesting for studying current political communication. The impact of SNSs is enormous, but the content that goes viral is not original. Of the top 10 pieces of content shared, nine were generated by the conventional media. Their qualitative analysis reveals that digital users preferably consume content prepared, produced and distributed by the conventional media, since in eight out of the 10 cases the information was first published by news outlets and in another it was an interview with a regional leader released by a political party. In a nutshell, this study is based on two approaches, the first involving theory. Even now at a time of sweeping digital transformations, framing studies are useful for modern-day political communication. Theory will ultimately evolve towards a hybrid research logic combining the general framing of the traditional media and that created by social media users. This evolution will lead to the disappearance of a type of study and use of framing (Cacciatore, Scheufele, & Iyengar, 2016), as new academic uses linked to artificial intelligence or big data emerge (Jungherr & Theocharis, 2017). This paper is relevant to that theoretical development inasmuch as H1 and H2 cast light on a burning political issue. The building of political heroes, in the conceptualisation inherent to populism in the digital age, requires an intensive use of SNSs, since they offer a shortcut for developing feelings, genuineness and confidence. The second approach is the recognition of the importance\u2014still enormous\u2014of the conventional press in digital conversations. The impact of SNSs, in particular Twitter, on research on political communication has monopolised congresses, papers and academic works in recent years. While interest in the press and the legacy media has diminished, as if they were exclusionary realities. This work, through H3, has strived to  52 recover the idea of hybrid studies that associate political activity with digital conversations and journalistic reality. In the age of fake news, such an approach contributes to blur the populist tendency to control the message and the messenger. That is the paradox of framing oneself as hero or traitor in the populist time To sum up, this paper has made inroads into populist political communication theory, has avoided the study of SNSs in isolation from their relationship with the conventional media and has contributed to a better epistemology of political leadership.  6.

The selected news item deals with some words spoken by the president of the Government of Catalonia (Spain), Quim Torra, in one of his official speeches, as well as the feedback proposed by the Institute created in honour of the civil rights activist, Martin Luther King. The research sought to study the influence of the ideologically-mediated virtual encounters when exposed to certain information. The case study employs techniques for the analysis of big data in social media based on the tool Twitter Capture and Analysis Toolset (DMI-TCAT), and applies the Louvain Multinivell algorithm. This method reveals how misinformation and subsequent corrections are unequally disseminated throughout a highly politicised network, in which different groups of users are exposed to different information. 27,648 actors and 76,815 connections were analysed. In addition, the utility of the Social Network and the Big Data Analysis in the detection of dissemination of fake news and its possible mitigation are discussed.

Introduction 1.1. Fake news, disinformation and post-truth Fake news and the spread of distorted information is not new, although in today\u2019s world they represent one of the main problems of the digital era (Palomo and Sedano, 2018) and threaten to affect public discourse and democratic decision-making (Stewart et al., 2019). The 2016 presidential elections in the United States and the Brexit process in the United Kingdom, among other events of global scope, have boosted the study of this phenomenon from complementary perspectives, including sociology, psychology, political science and communication.  After the elections whose outcome was the Donald Trump presidency in the United States, studies such as that by Bovet and Makse (2019) or the one by Silverman, Strapagiel, Shaban and Hall (2016) have revealed surprising and worrying data, including that 25% of tweets sent during the US elections contained false or extremely partisan information (Bovet and Makse, 2019) or that false news is accepted to a greater extent and has a greater capacity for going viral among the public than real news (Silverman, Strapagiel, Shaban and Hall, 2016). In fact, another study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) ascertains that fake news is 70% more likely to be shared on Twitter than true news, and is spread by real people rather than bots (Dizikes, 2018). The scientific and social discussion surrounding the phenomenon of fake news and its consequences in our society motivated the Oxford English Dictionary \u2013considered to be the most learned and complete dictionary in the English language\u2013 to declare \u201cfake news\u201d to be its word of the year in 2017, just a year after it gave this honour to the term \u201cpost-truth\u201d. Actually, both matters are closely related, since fake news refers to the material element that is so much a part of the political and social context referred to by the philosophical term, post-truth.  In fact the post-truth phenomenon is one of the great subjects for study and one of the major challenges for today\u2019s society. The problem of fake news, disinformation, hoaxes and biased content \u2013which we place in the same context\u2013 is, according to Aparici and Garc\u00eda-Mar\u00edn (2019), especially sensitive when it takes place within the coordinates of political institutions and media organizations. Thus, Murolo (2019) defines a post-truth as an idea or a set of images, social representations or meaning \u2013already incorporated by audiences\u2013 and from which arise possible fake news, which refers to this idea, affirming it and amplifying it. Post-news is closely related to the decline of the traditional media and the rise of \u201chyperpartisan false digital media\u201d (Aparici and Garc\u00eda-Mar\u00edn, 2019). It is also closely linked to the trail we leave on the Web and the data that can be obtained from our interactions on the Internet, as well as with the importance of the cognitive biases that we humans have. In recent years, then, definitions of the fake news phenomenon have proliferated and significant progress has been made as regards its ontology. Lazer et al. (2018) define it as fabricated information that imitates media content in form, but not in the process of making it or the intention of the organization behind it. Pennycook and Rand (2018) talk about striking content created for dissemination on the social media, which usually contains highly partisan content in order to boost public engagement. From a journalistic perspective, Amoros-Garc\u00eda (2018) describes it as \u201cfalse information designed to pass as news with the goal of spreading a deception, or deliberate disinformation in order to obtain a political or financial goal.\u201d Nielsen and Graves (2017) identify other uses of the term, such as covering tendentious news, use of partisan rhetoric, use of false or scandalous statements by politicians, etc. (see Figure 1). As regards the categorisation of this fake news, the scientific community has also contributed various classifications (Wardl, 2017; Higgins, 2017; Nielsen and Graves, 2017; OpenSources.co, 2018; Zimdars, 2016). In most of these taxonomies it is possible to appreciate two common elements that should be highlighted: the intentional motivation and the disinformation it creates. With regard to this last matter, the European Union, in its deliberations with experts and in one of its official reports dedicated ad-hoc to this subject, has tended to favour the use of the term \u201cdisinformation\u201d to refer to the phenomenon, with the goal of avoiding confusion in political, media and academic debates. This body understands disinformation as \u201cfalse, inaccurate or misleading information designed, presented and promoted to intentionally cause public harm or for profit\u201d (Ba\u00eddez, 2018; Guess, Nyhan, Reifler, 2018; European Union, 2018).      57 Figure 1: Nielsen and Graves\u2019 proposal to classify fake news (2017) \n Source: Own adaptation with original information by Nielsen and Graves (2017)  It would also be useful to take into account the technological and social context that has favoured the rise or proliferation of false news content. Although rumours are an inherent part of being human beings in society and journalistic sensationalism is a reality with a long tradition, it is nonetheless true that the rise of fake news in the time of post-truth coincides, among other things, with the rise of social media as communications instruments. The consolidation of the easy-to-use social media \u2013especially Twitter and Facebook\u2013 have nurtured the growth of fake news (L\u00f3pez-Borrull, Vives-Gr\u00e0cia and Badell, 2018). In this regard, according to the data provided by the Reuters Institute in its 2018 Digital News Report, the consumption of news on offline media continues to fall and the general trend is for readerships, particularly younger ones, to move onto more private applications to read and discuss news. In fact, the latest data in this report, from 2019, corroborate the notion that the social media and instant messaging systems are now on a par with television in terms of news consumption: four out of ten Internet users prefer online sources, compared to 42% who prefer television. What is more, the social media offer impressive communicative possibilities for those broadcasting companies that aim to expand on a message, as well as favouring direct interaction with and among citizens, the creation of communities and the establishment of a bi-directional communication model (Rodr\u00edguez-Andr\u00e9s and Ure\u00f1a-Uceda 2012). In this regard, Twitter has become a consolidated medium in political communication (Campos-Dom\u00ednguez, 2017), becoming one of the most powerful communication mechanisms in history, changing the Internet and completing the social shift initiated by blogs in the late 1990s (Rodr\u00edguez-Andr\u00e9s and Ure\u00f1a-Uceda 2012). Given this situation, the aim of this study is not to focus on the debate around the definition or taxonomy of fake news. In fact, it is no easy matter to obtain a clear definition of what the scientific community recognizes as fake news. This study shares the reflection of the experts who worked with the European Union, and situates its analysis within the framework of the disinformation that low-quality journalism generates within a politically polarized context (specifically, relating to the Catalan independence movement). This context favours the proliferation of fake news due to the confirmation bias of participants in a digital conversation. Its analysis is also embedded in the consequences of this situation, described from a perspective of digital sociology.  1.2. \u201cMedia neopopulism\u201d This study views the social context as consisting of masses who are saturated with information, and who self-communicate (Castells, 2009) using social media and instant digital messaging services. It therefore researches, from a relational point of view, the interactions that occur on Twitter after the publication of a political news item that promotes disinformation. \n 58 With respect to the contribution to the new communication paradigm of the social media, fake news and other contemporary elements, it is important to mention the recent reflections of Tornero, Samy and Tejedor (2018). These authors propose moving towards a new model they call \u201cmedia neopopulism\u201d, where fake news and disinformation find their place and function, promoting tendencies to sentimentalism, demagogy and self-isolation among communities that debate in the public space.  According to Tornero, Samy and Tejedor (2018), referring to other authors such as Gottfried and Shearer (2016) and Fletcher et al. (2018), this media populism is characterized by: 1) the accentuation of the spectacularisation of politics; 2) the continuous erosion of the classical media as sources of information and filters applied to the quality of information; 3) the hegemony of the social media; 4) a growing personalism in politics which strengthens leaders with media presence who are able to overcome or bypass traditional political institutions; 5) and the emergence of an emotional dimension in discourses, to the detriment of realistic and rational analysis. Along these same lines, these authors collate other reflections from the last century, such as those by Baudrillard (1991), Chomsky (1989) and Baumann (1993), which point to a change in communications paradigm, towards more radical public discourse and the resurgence of propaganda-style methods assumed to be something of the past within the contexts of liberal democracies. In fact, we have gone beyond \u201cthe paradigm of spectacular mediatization\u201d of communication in the public space which was in place previously. This paradigm was characterised by the intimate connection between the growing trend of commercialization of public discourse (especially through advertising and marketing) and its consequences in the profound transformation of political discourse. The same authors point to \u201cemotional hypertrophy\u201d as a major element acting within this paradigm, and offer a reminder that the most significant trend is the systematic subordination of fact-based and rational discourse to another, emotional and theatrical, kind, based essentially on the strengthening of spectacle and dramatization (Tornero, Samy and Tejedor, 2018).  This new communication paradigm is, according to Tornero, Samy and Tejedor (2018), indicative of going beyond the spectacular mediatization of the capitalist liberal context and involves a regression to the past, in which ingredients of paradigms thought to be obsolete are recovered. This is the setting, then for the proliferation of fake news, emotionalized audiences, the use of more classical propaganda mechanisms by different agents, etc.  1.3 Disinformation, and isolated and dialectic spaces  The digital conversation that arose with regard to the news item analysed in this study (which we could place nearer to \u201cpoor journalism\u201d than to fake news, according to Nielsen and Graves\u2019 classification) is a good example of this incipient new communications paradigm and of the existence of two spaces on the social media. These frequently appear in opposition, in clearly polarised political and social states: on the one hand, endogamic spaces where one\u2019s own \u201ctribe\u201d is primary and where the content that circulates, which may well be dialogic, contributes almost exclusively to reinforcing the beliefs of that community; and, on the other hand, more dialectic spaces, where more plural and divergent information, perspectives and interactions come into contact. Dialogue (from which the term \u201cdialogic\u201d comes) and dialectic are concepts that have been extensively studied and theorized (Abell\u00e1n-Garc\u00eda, 2012). The sociologist Richard Sennett (2012) distinguishes between dialectic communication (oriented towards the explicit meaning of statements, and by which a common understanding or synthesis is sought) and dialogic (oriented towards what is implicit and which is not aimed at a kind of synthesis, but rather at understanding interlocutors in all their complexity, resulting in a less competitive interaction) (Morales i Gras, 2017). In this study, these terms are simplified somewhat in order to describe two situations that coexist on the social media: spaces that tend towards isolation and which produce eminently \u201cdialogic noise\u201d, and more dialectic spaces, that seek solutions in which some ideas win out over others.  This study aims to contribute to the scientific community information about the behaviour on social media of disinformation or fake news, describing the form of dissemination and the relationships that are set up in the digital conversation about this information. So, it adopts an approach close to the viewpoint contributed by Vosoughi, Roy and Aral (2018) and their research, which gives a prominent position to the ideological variable in the circulation of false information; in particular, political news reaches into more spaces, is disseminated more quickly and affects more people than news related to other themes, basically because of humans\u2019 cognitive bias.  59 With regard to that stated above, the hypothesis that has guided the study considers that, in polarized communicative spaces such as the context analysed (regarding the Autonomous Region of Catalonia) the digital conversation tends toward an isolated space where communities are impermeable to ideological difference. Something else that contributes to this situation is confirmation bias, which is especially present in the dissemination of disinformation. The study has also sought to obtain empirical, verifiable data regarding these social media spaces, which are more dialogic than dialectic and where interactions often do not contribute to closure but rather are oriented principally at confirming the beliefs of the group the user belongs to.   2. The case study On 13 September 2018 the Spanish digital media organisation Elconfidencial.com published a news item that, in just a few hours, created a significant impact on social media and also among many traditional and digital media. The content of the news item was related to the President of four months of the Catalan Parliament (the Generalitat), Joaquim Torra Pla (Quim Torra), and an icon of worldwide fame, known for his contribution to the struggle for civil rights, Martin Luther King.  The link from the news item signed by David Brunat was first published on Twitter on the morning of 14 September 2018. The headline of the item, literally replicated on Twitter, said the following: \u201cEl Instituto Luther King de EE.UU. pide que Torra deje de usar su figura: \u2018Es hip\u00f3crita\u2019\u201d (\u201cThe US Luther King Institute asks Torra to stop using his name: \u2018It\u2019s hypocritical\u2019\u201d) (figure 2) [1].  Figure 2: News item published in El Confidencial \n Source: Screenshot from the Elconfidencial.com website The news item was connected to a statement made by Quim Torra during a speech entitled \u201cOur moment\u201d, read at the National Theatre of Catalonia, on 4 September 2018. In the speech, Torra made a literal reference to Luther King:  That proposal that I make to the people of Catalonia can be summarized very simply: either freedom or freedom. Based on the 1 October mandate and on the great struggles for freedom that we all have in our memories, such as for example Martin Luther King\u2019s fight for civil rights, I propose an action that all Catalans should make their own, if they wish to accept it: a march for the civil, social and national rights of Catalonia; a march of citizens who take the free determination to be a constituent people (Torra, Q. 2018. Catalan Generalitat, Presidential Department). The allusion that Quim Torra made to Martin Luther King in the context of Catalonia was used by the El Confidencial journalist to publish the news item cited, which contained statements made by the Director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at the University of Stanford (California), Clayborne Carson, without specifying the medium where the statements appeared or where he obtained the information.  Just a few hours after the news item was disseminated, Carson published [2] on his blog a \u201cdenial\u201d (ElNacional.cat, 2018), stating the following: I was shocked and disturbed today to discover that I had been misquoted in a Spanish newspaper that claimed I believe Martin Luther King, Jr. would have opposed the Catalan independence movement. This distorts what I actually said in response to a Spanish reporter\u2019s questions (Carson, C. 2019).  \n 60 The link to the news item cited and the original Elconfidencial.com tweet (see figure 3) were repeated and retweeted over the next few hours by political and social profiles well known for their opposition to Catalan independence, such as In\u00e9s Arrimadas (from the Citizens party) and Sociedad Civil Catalana (a civil political initiative which, according to its articles of association, is against Catalan independence), and for holding important public positions whose responsibilities include the image projected by Spain in the international arena, such as Josep Borrell (Minister of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation) (see figures 4, 5 and 6). Figure 3: News item published in Elconfidencial.com [3]  \n Source: Twitter Figures 4, 5 and 6: Tweets by Josep Borrell, In\u00e9s Arrimadas and Sociedad Civil Catalana    \n     \n Source: Twitter \n 61 Despite the clarifications offered by Clayborne Carson, the dissemination of the original news item continued to increase over the next few hours. Other media organizations and various Twitter users participated in the conversation, publishing and attesting to Carson\u2019s original statements, or replicating the news published by media following on from those declarations (figures 7 and 8). Figures 7 and 8: News items published on Huffingtonpost.es and Elnacional.cat  \n \n Source: www.huffington post and www.elnacional.cat  The digital conversation did not stop with the publication of the statements made by Clayborne Carson referred to above and the news reporting his denial of the original Elconfidencial.com news item. This organization, for example, published the original audio files of the telephone conversation that the journalist had with the Institute\u2019s director. The tweets made by Borrell, Arrimadas and Sociedad Civil Catalana, as important drivers of the conversation, were not retracted or rephrased at a later stage.  3. Method The results offered by this study form part of a broader research project that uses Big Data analysis techniques to understand different political and social phenomena. This project monitors the Twitter social networking service with respect to various different events. In order to \u201clisten in\u201d to the digital conversation, the Twitter Capture and Analysis Toolset, developed by Digital Methods Initiative (DMI-TCAT) at the University of Amsterdam (Borra and Rieder, 2014) is used. This is the most useful free, open source Twitter analysis tool (Felt, 2016). The project fits into the \u201csocial media analytics\u201d framework, which is a method and set of tools that relate the space of actors (people, organizations, etc.) to emerging social structures, focussing on the relationships that these actors establish. This analysis considers that explanations of social phenomena can be improved through the examination of relations among actors, studying the behaviour of individuals at \n 62 a micro level, patterns of relationships (the structure of the network) at a macro level, and the interactions between the two levels (Sanz-Men\u00e9ndez, 2003). In this regard, this study considers that online social media such as Twitter are useful when it comes to analysing social or interpersonal relations that enable connections among individuals or organizations. This social networking service makes it possible to capture an extensive variety of information either in real time or retrospectively, offering unprecedented access to records of online human activity over time (Del Fresno-Garc\u00eda, 2014). Thus, this study observes the ways in which actors are linked, determining the general structure of the network, its groups and the position of unique profiles within it, in order to explain its structure. With this aim, the methodology proposed is based on graph theory. This has demonstrated its usefulness in social media analytics for three reasons, as Sanz-Men\u00e9ndez (2003) explains: in order to use a vocabulary that can be employed to analyse many characteristics of social structures; to offer mathematical operations by means of which these characteristics can be analysed and measured; to make it possible to test theorems regarding graphs and, therefore, deduce and test certain statements.  The corpus employed in this study was obtained automatically through Twitter\u2019s Application Programming Interface (API), a free, public service offered by the platform. The data captured are interactions (for example, retweets, replies and direct appeals) established among Twitter users. These users are considered to be the nodes or vertices of the network, and the edges are the interactions established among them. After the network\u2019s graph was modelled, the Gephi software (Bastian, Heymann and Cacomy, 2009; Chomsky et al., 2009) was used, and a series of network analysis algorithms were applied, such as the Louvain Multilevel community detection algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008), which gives an account of the different communities that respond to different conversations that can be identified in the data. To give a clearer view of the network and to favour an interpretation of the phenomenon analysed (Venturini, Jacomy and Jensen, 2019), the Force Atlas 2 algorithm (Jacomy et al., 2014) was also applied; this gives a representation of proximity between those nodes that have interacted, and distance between those nodes that have not. Bearing in mind the goals and hypothesis of this study, as well as the scientific framework within which it is set, the timeframe of the study has been considered to be the spontaneous spread of the original news item and of news that subsequently arose concerning the topic. For this study, the researchers monitored Twitter for three days, which was long enough for the most important events, described above, to take place. So the time period of the study is from 13 September 2018 (the moment of the first tweet regarding the news item) and 15 September 2018. The terms \u201cLuther King\u201d and \u201cTorra\u201d were monitored together in order to capture all the posts in which both figures were mentioned. The research team decided to select this case in order to contribute to the growing scientific literature on the taxonomy of fake news, and the behaviour and influence of disinformation on our society. Fake news and different forms of disinformation have significantly influenced recent electoral and social processes. However, the aim is not so much to observe the false or true nature of any given journalistic product, but rather to analyse the circulation process of certain information in structures that offer full support for its participants\u2019 confirmation bias. It must be kept in mind that false information has its effect on the world of journalism, one that is in constant development, and that it has a considerable negative impact because, among other reasons, it has a high capacity for viralisation that hardly offers users or the public either space or means to defend themselves or inoculate themselves against infection.  4. Results According to the methodological criteria given in the last section, the network captured includes 27,648 actors or users who participated in the digital conversation on Twitter regarding this controversy, establishing 76,815 connections or mentions, mainly tweets established among these users. Each actor is connected to a mean of another 3.1 actors, which means that only 0.01% of the possible connections among actors materialise. The relational density of the structure is, then, very low.       63 Figure 9: Graph of the digital conversation \n Source: own elaboration with DMI-TCAT  The application of the above-mentioned Louvain Multilevel community detection algorithm \u2013used both in sociological research and computational and biomedical research, and which allows massive network analysis at different resolutions\u2013 makes it possible to identify and distinguish, with colours, debates that represent differentiated communication flows [4]. In the case analysed, the morphology of the graph indicates that there exist three communities of an eminently endogamic nature (green, orange and blue) and two communities, more exogamic in nature (lilac and grey). These exogamic communities represent, on the graph, the centre of the digital conversation, grouping together different profiles that congregate on the debate in order to give an opinion or enter into the discussion. Below is a detailed description of the communities indicated, both endogamic and exogamic: \u2022 In the green community (the most numerous one, which includes 41.66% of the actors in the network), leaders or reference points in the conversation can be identified as the profiles of the economist Xabier Sala-i-Martin; the President of the Generalitat, Quim Torra; and Clayborne Carson, Director of the Martin Luther King Institute. The contents shared deny the initial information and make reference to the statement on Carson\u2019s blog. This community is located at one end of the graph, maintaining contact mainly with the lilac community.  \u2022 The orange (18.01% of the actors in the network) and blue (7.96% of the actors in the network) communities are led by figures such as, in the first case, the Member of the Catalan Parliament for the Citizens party, Jordi Canyas; and the bullfighter Cristian Escribano. In the second case, figures such as the Elconfidencial.com journalists Juan Soto Ivars and Rafael M\u00e9ndez emerge. This community spread the original news item published by Elconfidencial.com and the later response by this media organization to the accusations of fabricating fake news. As in the case given in the first point, both \n 64 clusters were located far from the centre of the graph which represents, in this case, the nexus of union between the most polarized communities.  \u2022 In an intermediate position, the lilac (24.89%) and grey (7.48%) communities were led by users such as the Elconfidencial.com official account and political personalities with a position against Catalan independence such as Josep Borrell (Spanish Socialist Party), Miquel Iceta (Catalan Socialist Party) and In\u00e9s Arrimadas (Citizens Party). All of them disseminated the initial information, received criticism from users such as Toni Soler (journalist, writer and independence activist), Rafael Pous (lecturer at Pompeu Fabra University and activist with the Consell de la Rep\u00fablica organization) and Joe Brew (data analyst), who are prominent, but not leading figures. Both the lilac community (the second largest), and the grey community (which is much smaller), are located in the centre of the graph.  So, according to the data obtained, the communities that in this study we consider to be isolated and impermeable to ideological difference make up a greater percentage (67.6%) than those communities which are open to dialogue (32.34%). As has been explained, the algorithms implemented (Force Atlas 2 and Louvain Multilevel) made it possible to obtain these data: the first of the algorithms gathers linked nodes together, and separates unlinked nodes; the second algorithm identifies communities, taking as a reference the links between nodes. Both algorithms used together were applied to create a graph in which the central communities are those whose nodes also share links with nodes of other communities. In this regard, this study considers that these are the least endogamic communities. Everything considered, the space for dialectic confrontation (as an effect of the debate among users supposedly informed or misinformed based on different sources) represents a smaller space in the graph than the compartments we consider to be closed, generated by dialogic noise. In fact, over two thirds of the total space of the digital conversation is occupied by less dialectic space. This observation is made possible by the graph resulting from this study, which shows a predominance of spaces where social homophily (having more links related to those with similar characteristics) is dominant, with profiles embedded in clusters far from the centre. This suggests that those who are located in these positions have more extreme postures, and potentially have a lower disposition to enter into dialogue with those who differ, and less openness to being convinced.  The opposite is the case with those references and profiles found in the centre of the graph, which represents the conversation, in that these could have been acting as \u201cbridges\u201d between one sensibility and its opposite, according to the interpretation that results from this digital conversation. They could constitute a \u201cbridge\u201d or connection point in order, in this case, to refute or redress biased or false information, and even to bring together postures that are dialectically in opposition. This position, then, is the one with the greatest dialectic potential, but it is also an enclave that is unstable due to its conflictivity. In fact, encounters among differing users in these kinds of spaces and in polarized contexts can be very disagreeable in networks dominated by political homophily, with a risk that people will only see the worst of others, thus reinforcing the feeling of belonging to a certain group.  5. Discussion This piece of research seeks to contribute to the scientific literature regarding the function and workings of the social media and the dissemination of false information from an ideological perspective. As was indicated in the theoretical section, the specialized literature prioritizes an idea of the social media as isolated or endogamic spaces (Wu S., Hofman, J.M, Mason, W. A. 2011; Lotan G., 2011) which do not even guarantee multi-directionality, given that this depends on the use made of them (Rost, 2012). Making use of this endogamy and the confirmation bias mentioned above, disinformation is spread rapidly, without being checked or verified, by profiles grouped into communities with elements in common. This is precisely the hypothesis confirmed by this study, that is to say, that the digital conversation tends to constitute an isolated space and the communities that emerge from the conversation are not porous to ideological difference. Authors such as Lozares-Colina (2011) contrast this social homophily with social cohesion, which gives a negative sense to the orientation taken by social media such as Twitter. Homophily means that it is more likely that practices, habits, opinions, mutually-held knowledge and common relationships will occur among individuals with equal social characteristics such as age, gender, educational level, social class or status, etc. (Lozares-Colina, 2011). It is this fact that brings together people on social networking services, which will later be used to disseminate information that contributes to creating interpretations of the facts that occur around us.  65 As can be seen in this study, in a context of significant political polarization, participants or people tend to relate to an even greater degree with their peers, with individuals who have similar social attributes, with greater possibilities for frequent encounters, more agreement in their opinions and similar practices (McPherson, Smith-Lovin and Cook, 2001). In any case, with a view to the social cohesion sought by democratic societies, it could be very valuable to identify these nexuses of union, or spaces of centrality or communality in different conversations and in public debates, in order to influence, with greater precision, those groups with differing opinions. This result is therefore of great interest from a strategic point of view, although it is still a major challenge for those agents who wish to influence social and political contexts, in that those central spaces in digital conversations can be considered as coveted spaces for dialectic struggle. Another of the potentialities in this research is the case study selected, which could act as a model for similar conversations and contexts. This case study took place in a society, the Spanish one, which is very aware of this matter, and which the Eurobarometer of autumn 2019 put as the top nation when it came to detecting fake news, or news that presented a distorted reality, although with relatively less confidence in terms of its own ability to detect these contents (Eurobarometer, 2019). The study is also connected to an event that occurred in a highly polarized context, with opposing positions that are reflected in the traditional media and in the opinions posted to the social media. What is more, the political and social event analysed occurred a few months after two of the most important social media organisations announced measures to control disinformation and to stop users becoming victims of fake news: Twitter cancelled 70 million accounts between May and June 2018 (Washington Post, 2018), and Facebook removed, in August 2018, hundreds of accounts from Iran and Russia for committing supposedly \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour\" (Facebook, 2018). As with all case studies, the analysis carried out also had some limitations inherent to these kinds of approaches, such as the difficulty in extrapolating results to other cases; in this regard, its usefulness resides essentially in the effectiveness of the methodology employed and in the possibility of replicating the study in other, similar cases. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the people or organizations that intend to make progress in terms of the potential virtues offered by this study, could systematise this kind of practice in order to affect public opinion. Furthermore, it is worth remembering that this study situates the problem of fake news and disinformation within a broader context of a change of communication paradigm, observing the phenomenon from its sociological and relational perspective. In this regard, these kinds of study aim to emphasise the social research focus, observing the connections among the actors who interact within the social context. In fact, it is the traces we leave on the social media that demonstrate these connections among entities, as well as the patterns of our behaviour, and antecedents and consequences of that behaviour (Schmidt, 2002). This case study, then, aims to contribute to the scientific debate that has arisen regarding the reasons why the public believes and spreads fake news. Recent studies, such as the one by Pennycook and Rand (2019) attribute its greater influence to a kind of cognitive laziness that is a result of the massification of data and information that we are currently experiencing and that, therefore, open up a new area for study in this field. They therefore minimize the impact of ideological or partisan reasoning, which differentiates their work from the current that is presently dominant, which attributes the rapid dissemination of falsified content to confirmation bias (the public\u2019s need to ratify its beliefs).  The case analysed here points in this last direction. Evidently a certain \u201ccognitive laziness\u201d can happen when disseminating disinformation massively on the social media. However, it is also clear that the ideological poles that can be seen in other spaces of daily life have their reflection in the digital conversation, and for this reason, confirmation bias is an essential factor. The key in this regard is that political polarization favours the proliferation of fake news by means of confirmation bias: receivers of messages seek those inputs that confirm their own beliefs, tastes and emotions. In short, ideological polarization is the strongest force that pushes us to disseminate content that misinforms. It is here where we would like to raise the reflection about post-truth stated at the beginning of this study: \u201crelating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief\u201d (Oxford Dictionary). Why does this happen? Among other reasons, because of the \u201cbackfire effect\u201d explained by Nyham and Reifler in 2006: if an individual has a certain belief, her or his determination will be to protect it, and if it is confronted or opposed, that person\u2019s reaction will be to defend it, rather than to question it. The \u201cbackfire effect\u201d and the elements viewed in this case are related to concepts common to different societies in different geographical areas. This is not a matter, then, of where this phenomenon occurs, but rather of identifying how polarized a society\u2019s digital conversation is in order to intuit the homophily of its online relationships and foresee the high viralisation of false information in digital communities. This idea,  66 sometimes known as the \u201cecho chamber\u201d effect, has been widely studied by authors such as T\u00f6rnberg (2018).   6. Conclusions In our days it is obvious that the scientific community has a great interest in questions that still require clear answers, such as the reasons why lies, disinformation, sensationalism, etc. spread in the Internet era. There exists a sociological theorem known as the Thomas Theorem which states that \u201cif people define situations as real, they are real in their consequences\u201d (Thomas, 1928). The truth, then, is not as important in guiding people\u2019s behaviour as credibility: that a situation be interpreted, due to its appearance, as true. This is one of the premises that explains the success of fake news.  Among the many factors that might give credibility to a situation is what in research in the field of social psychology is called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d. This is the tendency to grant validity to information that confirms or fits into an individual\u2019s prior belief set. People, then, have a tendency to belief what coincides with and reinforces our conditions. Furthermore, it is our option whether or not to accept those pieces of information that contradict our beliefs, among other reasons because of the \u201cbackfire effect\u201d referred to above. The context in which we live obliges us to navigate a flow of continuous communicative operations, where the majority have importance for us in helping us to describe political and social contexts, as well as other realities. We therefore live engaged in a continuous endeavour to select those communicative interactions that we should take seriously and those which we should reject or ignore. So the question is simple: given this situation, what is the place of the social media? This study shows that in a specific case of political polarization and intense communicative activity, the social networking service of choice for political debate, Twitter, works mainly as a closed compartment: almost seven out of every ten participants in the conversation analysed participate as part of clusters oriented towards reinforcing their own beliefs and in order to communicate with people of similar characteristics. Despite this, there nonetheless exists a space with greater potential for dialogue, involving three out of ten conversation participants. This is a smaller community, but with greater potential to promote debate in spaces such as those offered by the social media. The conversation analysed is a good example of how social media can become both closed compartments (the green, orange and blue communities shown in the resulting graph) and dialogic and eventually dialectic spaces (the lilac and grey communities). The opportunities to establish connection with people who think and act differently are abundant. However, social logics and the most basic communicative biases, in this communication paradigm called by some authors, \u201cmedia neopopulism\u201d, often leads us towards endogamy. The polarization of the context in which this study took place (the Catalan bid for independence) involves a division of the communicative space that facilitates the dissemination of false information and de facto denies a right to reply. Most of the participants in the conversation are part of communities that are impermeable to ideological difference. Making them permeable to the debate and strategic pleas \u2013going beyond criticism and demands for rectification made to their community leaders\u2013 is essential for anyone wishing to influence, and anyone open to being influenced. Bearing in mind that the tactic among creators of false news is to use highly partisan political content in order to boost \u201cengagement\u201d and improve their visibility, disinformation \u2013whether on the Internet or off it\u2013 is successful when it fits congruously into people\u2019s previous beliefs. In this regard, so-called post-truth does not constitute a very important innovation in this new period of mass communication. What is new is the descriptive capacity that we now have with regard to these phenomena. In short, this piece of research reinforces studies demonstrating how Big Data can make it possible to better know our societies\u2019 readers, voters, consumers and users, as well as how we can be manipulated due to tendencies such as the \u201cbackfire effect\u201d and confirmation bias. Thus, in the case analysed, news content tending towards sensationalism circulates around previously segmented publics or previously constituted networks of affinity.  7.

This research analyses the content produced by several Spanish pages, identified as \"disinformation media\", both before and during the November 10 election campaign in Spain. Those Spanish websites that usually distribute junk content, that is to say, partisan, stemming from an extreme ideology and with a deeply propagandistic approach, were identified by means of the tool Junk News Aggregator of the Oxford Internet Institute. The aim was to disclose their political content agenda, the authorship of their publications, the treatment accorded to political groups and their representatives, and also to identify whether any variation in their activity occurred over the electoral period. Strategies of content and common publications, of a partisanal approach, lack of identification in the authorship and a clear ideological bias in favour of Vox were noted.

Introduction Disinformation plays a leading role in political news due to its effectiveness and capacity to influence citizens, which has been demonstrated in different international electoral processes. It has been shown that fake news has a more significant impact on political content than terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information (Vosoughi, Roy and Aral, 2018).  Political consultants contextualise disinformation \u201cin the crisis of trust and delegitimisation of institutions, political parties, and the media, citizens\u2019 lack of critical awareness, and the new orchestrated structures that allow fake content to spread and go viral quickly (Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez, 2019:5). Although this phenomenon has been long-established, it is recognised as a concern for their clients (Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez, 2019). Verifiers\u2019 activities have become more necessary than ever in election campaigns. The media and other organisations that collaborate and add value to the process, usually subscribe to verifiers\u00b4 activities. The study of beliefs is a fundamental line of research in the fight against disinformation, as is verification. Currently, most studies highlight conformity bias (Asch, 1951) as one of the reasons why disinformation is effective; this is because we tend to remember the information that confirms our beliefs and ignore that which is different from them.  Moravec, Minas, and Dennis (2019) analysed 80 university students\u2019 capacity to discern true and false information through electroencephalograms (EEGs). It was shown that they were more likely to believe the contents that aligned with their political beliefs. Recent studies have observed that we do not pay attention to the argumentative quality of those who have different opinions to ours. This attitude is more pronounced in more polarized people; we refuse to change our view and tend to reinforce our beliefs (Kappes, Harvey, Lohrenz, Monatgue, and Sharot, 2020). Confirmation bias is more pronounced in the digital environment due to the \u201cfilter bubble\u201d (Pariser, 2017), which is generated by the algorithms on social networks and search engines, it provides personalized results based on tastes, preferences and each user\u2019s behaviour. These \u201csocial bubbles\u201d are optimal for disinformation and polarized discourse (Nikolov, Oliveira, Flammini, and Menczer, 2015; DiFranco and Gloria- Garc\u00eda, 2017).  1.1 Junk news in election campaigns In the study of fake news, the Oxford Internet Institute (OII)\u2019s Computational Propaganda Project has created the specific categorisation-Junk News for partisan disinformation. \u201cJunk news\u201d is defined as different forms of propaganda, stemming from an extreme ideology, as well as hyperpartisan or conspiratorial political news and information (Bolsover and Howard, 2019; Gallacher, Barash, Howard and Kelly, 2018; Howard, Bolsover, Kollanyi, Bradshaw and Neudert, 2017; Howard, Woolley, and Calo, 2018; Woolley and Howard, (2017). To foster media literacy, its team has developed the tool Junk News Aggregator. This search engine provides information about the content publicly uploaded on Facebook by junk news sources, based on the following criteria (Liotsiou, Kollanyi, and Howard, 2019). Table 1. Criteria used to determine junk news in the Junk News Aggregator tool Professionalism These sources do not comply with optimal standards and professional journalism practices. They do not provide clear information about the real authors, editors, and owners. They lack transparency and accountability and do not rectify the information which is found to be inaccurate. Style These sources use emotive language, hyperbole, attacks, misleading headlines, excessive capitalisation, unsafe generalizations, and logical fallacies, moving images, and many pictures and mobilisation memes. Credibility These sources are based on false information and conspiracy. Conspiracy theories are often employed strategically. They inform without consulting multiple sources and do not check facts. The sources and norms of production are usually unreliable.  Bias: left bias, right bias Partial, ideologically biased, or hyper-partisan information. News coverage includes commentary on opinion and right incendiary views    73 Forgery    These sources imitate established news information. They forge sources, brands, and style strategies, and junk content is disguised as news. It references agencies and credible sources, and the headlines follow the same style as news, including date, time, and location.  Source: Liotsiou. Kollanyi and Howard (2019).  For a website to be classified as a source of junk news, it must comply with at least three or more of these criteria. As a reference, the study that was carried out in the run-up to the European parliamentary elections demonstrated that more than 27,000 junk contents were shared on Facebook and Twitter (Marchal, Kollanyi, Neudert, and Howard, 2019). Junk news \u201cis dangerous, not because it is false, but because it saturates the public debate, leaving no space to other discussions, reducing the richness of public debate, preventing more important stories from being heard. Like rumours, junk news proliferates by transmission and transformation\u201d (Venturini, 2019: 3).  1.2 Definition and influence of the \u201cdisinformation media.\u201d  In the disinformation ecosystem, several factors are at play, which contribute to its functioning: malicious content, the interaction between fake accounts and bots that encourage the spread of disinformation, micro-segmented advertising that drives content to go viral, and users who share content organically, etc. However, this content is usually sustained by a web page that looks like news. These sites could be called disinformation websites or media because they adopt the same look and form as the media, spread disinformation, and false contents, which are distorted or contain evaluative judgments that seek to benefit a political or social cause. Some investigations have linked the influence of these fake news pages to the media\u2019s news agenda, especially the information related to certain political actors (Guoy and Vargo, 2018). Likewise, these websites also serve business interests. During the Punica case investigation, it was revealed that its facilitator Alejandro de Pedro, provider and owner of the digital reputation company Eico Online Reputation Management, had worked for large companies such as Telef\u00f3nica, Sacyr, Bankia, Mediaset, IDC Salud, and Real Madrid. Eico had 60 websites, which under the guise of independent media, published positive information to improve their clients\u2019 digital reputation. In addition to helping them position their data better, the network was flooded with positive information, allowing clients to reduce the impact and exposure of negative news and commentary. In the case of Telef\u00f3nica and Bankia, up to 50 positive news items were published each week. The news was based on the corporations\u2019 press releases, and different versions were written for various media (Olmo, 2015). In 2017, several brands withdrew their advertising from the Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital website after a user started a campaign denouncing one of its headlines that insulted women. Some media such as Cadena Ser compared this site to Infowars or Breitbart News, websites that spread disinformation about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential elections in the United States (La Ser, 2017). In the case of Breitbart News, Steve Bannon, ex-advisor to Donald Trump, was formerly the CEO of the website.  Rodr\u00edguez-Ferr\u00e1ndiz points out that (2019:5), based on the data collected by Buzzfeed.org \u201cin the three-months leading up to the U.S elections, fraudulent sites and extremely radical and partisan blogs (such as Breitbart, Right Wing News, and Freedom Daily) spread false news regarding the elections that had a more significant impact on Facebook than the authentic electoral news from accredited media such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, NBC News, and others.  In Europe, the disinformation media do not seem to pose a threat when it comes to direct traffic. According to the study Measuring the reach of \u201cfake news\u201d and online disinformation in Europe, the total time dedicated to fake news websites is less than the time devoted to news websites.  However, users\u2019 interaction on social networks produces more fake content than factual ones. Users\u2019 level of engagement on Facebook created by a small number of fake news media coincided with or exceeded that from the most popular media outlets. In France, a disinformation site generated an average of over 11 million interactions per month, five times more than the most established news outlets. Fortunately, most propaganda sites are not as socially successful: the researchers highlight that both in France and Italy, fake news media do not generate as many interactions as established news outlets (Fletcher, Cornia, Graves, and Nielsen, 2018).  74 In Spain pages such as Espa\u00f1a Diario, among others, had over 3 million followers in January 2019, these sites are also linked to other websites such as Espa\u00f1a Sucesos, EltiempoenEspa\u00f1a.com, \u201cwebsites that feedback contents based on clickbait\u201d (Magall\u00f3n, 2019: 123). The case of Digital Sevilla stands out; it is a page that registers high levels of traffic on the website, contributing to its funding through programmatic advertising. In February 2018, it reached an audience of 496 000 unique users, positioning itself ahead of real media and leading media in the province such as Diario de Sevilla, which has around 50, 000 users (El Pa\u00eds, 2019). Previous investigations have highlighted these websites\u2019 activity and their relation to specific political parties, such is the case of the site Caso Aislado and its connections to Vox. (Hern\u00e1ndez and Fern\u00e1ndez, 2019). Also, the media has denounced the false identities of several journalists on sites such as Periodista Digital, where they appeared under the pseudonyms \u201cIvan Rastik,\u201d \u201cFrancisco Lorenson,\u201d and \u201cPaula Dumas,\u201d and whose images had been taken from databases. (Sarabia, 2019). These sources of disinformation could continue to gain traction in the future due to the continuous and unstoppable incorporation of technologies into daily routines. Mobile applications and virtual assistants provide results based on algorithms, but these do not feature verifications or ethical settings. Google Discover provides results from websites such as Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital, Caso Aislado, Periodista Digital, or DiarioGol, sites that are recognised by experts as disinformation sites (Castillo, 2019).  2. Methodology This study aims first to identify those websites that produce political disinformation in Spain and then analyse their activity before and during the Spanish presidential election campaign on 10 November 2019. This analysis was done using the Oxford Internet Institute\u2019s(OII\u2019s) Junk News Aggregator tool, which was created to make public the partisan information published in Europe and the U.K. in English, German, Spanish, French, Polish, Italian and Swedish.  Firstly, to identify junk news pages, a search for all content in Spanish was carried out between 1 June and 4 September 2019, this is when the last update was indicated in its register. The tool detected a total of 198 contents from the following websites:  Table 2. The volume of contents on disinformation sites using the Junk News Aggregator tool Websites Number of publications registered on  Junk News Aggregator  Mediterraneodigital.com   156 PeriodistaDigital.com  11 Eldiestro.es  9 Diarioalcazar.com  8 Diariopatriota.com  4 Latribunadeespana.com 4 Elmunicipio.es 3 DonDiario.com 2 ElcorreodeMadrid.com  1 Source: authors The tool Similarweb (https://www.similarweb.com/) has been employed To know the digital relevance of each page,, which provides traffic and audience data. Similarweb is a paid application, with over ten years of experience, whose analysis methodology gathers and contrasts information from four different sources: 1) the website owners\u2019 direct traffic (2) information from external providers, (3) public data sources (indexing) and (4) anonymous behaviour data. Through this application, only results from Mediterraneodigital.com, PeriodistaDigital.com, Eldiestro.es, Diariopatriota.com, and ElMunicipio.es have been obtained, those webpages that did not present traffic data have been excluded from the final analysis, as they were considered to be insufficiently representative.  Two periods of content analysis have been established after obtaining this initial snapshot. The first period was before the election campaign, between 14 and 20 of October 2019, and the second one during the general election campaign, which was reduced to only a week of campaigning, between 1 and 8 of November. In both weeks, the contents published in the \u201cpolitical\u201d section or when this section was not  75 included in the \u201cnational\u201d or \u201cSpain\u201d section were obtained, the date of publication, author, title, and information link were identified.  It is assumed that these media, which have already been categorised as propaganda by the Oxford Internet Institute, could increase the publication of junk news during the election campaign to influence it for or against some political parties. Therefore, a qualitative and quantitative content analysis was carried out on the information gathered to compare both periods.  For this purpose, the following research objectives are presented:  \u2022 Compare the sites\u2019 traffic (through secondary sources) to determine their relevance \u2022 Examine its thematic agenda in the political and/or national sections \u2022 Register the authorship of the publications \u2022 Identify the political actors most present in the contents \u2022 Examine the media\u2019s assessment of such political actors.  \u2022 Compare the two periods to see if there are changes during the election period.  The items used by Hern\u00e1ndez and Fern\u00e1ndez (2019: 41) have been taken as a reference to determine the units of analysis. Their analysis is based on analysing headlines (Andreu, 2012) and the concerns disclosed by the CIS barometer (November 2018). We chose this categorisation because these authors\u2019 study also addresses the disinformation website (Caso Aislado). Therefore it could be correlated with this work. The information was categorised manually on the data collection sheet. The units of analysis used and the type of analysis applied to each are indicated below:  Quantitative analysis:  \u2022 Catalonia \u2022 Feminism \u2022 Immigration: public aid, crimes committed by immigrants, Islam. \u2022 Patriotism \u2022 Vox attacks from the media, others attacks or assault Quantitative and Qualitative analysis:  \u2022 Presence of different political actors and the news coverage of them (positive, negative or neutral) It is worth noting that the first week coincided with the publication of the sentence of the trial of the Catalonian Independence leaders, which also marks the thematic agenda of the sites analysed.   3. Results 3.1 Traffic comparison of disinformation sites Regarding the audience analysis, the website with the most significant impact is PeriodostaDigital, followed by Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital, Diario Patriota, El Diestro, and finally, El Municipio. In general terms, their traffic is mainly direct. In the case of social networks\u2019 traffic, Facebook, and Twitter, these are the networks that gain a bigger audience from it. Regarding the reference traffic (\u201cReferral\u201d), i.e., the audience coming from other websites is quite dispersed, with few forums in common such as burbuja.info, meneame.net, and dolcacatalunya.com           76 Table 3.

Structure of the contents.  The website that has the most content in the periods analysed is Periodista Digital, which had 135 publications in the election campaign week and 107 during the comparative week in October. It is followed by El Diestro, which has less than half: 48 in October and 66 in November. El Municipio is the least active website, with less than ten items per week.  Although there is a higher number of publications during the election campaign week, this increase is not significant since the website with the highest number of contents, Periodista Digital, had a rise of only 28 items, arriving at an average of 4 more daily publications. Nevertheless, the global result is significant since, during the election campaign week, the five web sites would have spread 299 contents, yielding an average of 42.7 daily publications, which were likely to contain disinformation. This activity is similar to the previous week of analysis. Therefore we can establish the comparative framework, in which there were 240 publications, a daily average of 34.2.  77 Table 4. Content published by each website. Web page The activity log of the analyzed pages Week  Average media content published daily Week 1 to 8 November (election campaign) Average media content published daily 14 to 20 October Periodista 107 15.2 135 19.2 Digital El Diestro 48 6.8 66 9.4 El Patriota 49 7 54 7.7 Mediterr\u00e1neo 26 3.7 39 5.5 Digital El Municipio 9 1.2 3 0.4 Source: authors Regarding the authors, most of the items feature \u201ceditorial staff\u201d or the name of the media in their byline. In Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital, this appears in 80% of the total number of publications, in El Patriota 55.3%, and in the case of El Diestro 58%. El Municipio, which is the page with the least number of contents, has no nominal authors and the name of the web page features in all the bylines.  Periodista Digitial is the exception, as the name of the media appears in the byline in only 5.3% of contents, whereas Francisco Lorenson is credited in most of the publications\u2019 bylines. Francisco Lorenson is one of the false identities denounced by Eldiario.es, as well as Paula Dumas and Iv\u00e1n Rastik, who are also credited as authors on this site. However, it is the only website that registers opinion contents, featuring opinion pages by authors who do not have a profession or curriculum that adds value or justifies their vision.  In the case of Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital, there are also publications taken from the media (La Raz\u00f3n, Europa Press, El Mundo, Cadena Ser). The volume of authors found on Periodista Digital, and El Diestro is remarkable, given that they have a large staff or many collaborators for an \u201calternative\u201d website. Table 5: number of named authors identified on each page Web page  Total number of identified named authors (\u201ceditorial staff,\u201d \u201cname of the webpage\u201d or references to the media are not included) Week 14 to 20 October Week 1 to 8 November (election campaign) Periodista Digital 26 34 El Diestro 15 12 El Patriota 3 3 Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital 4 2 El Municipio No authors No authors Source: authors We determined whether the authors coincided in both periods of analysis. El Patriota is the website with the highest coincidence: as three authors appeared in two samples, in El Diestro.es, we observe that 12 of the 18 authors appear on several occasions, while in Periodista Digital 19 out of 43 are the same and in Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital only one coincidence is registered.   3.3 Content analysis: political aspects There are general similarities in the websites\u2019 approach to contents. The PSOE and Podemos are widely criticised and satirised as opposed to Vox, which receives praise. Cuidadanos is the party that goes the most unnoticed, and the P.P. is covered more neutrally, sometimes with sympathetic overtones. This is clear in the tendency to use populist adjectives. Below are some of the examples of both extremes:  \u2022 Irene Montero\u2019s CV: Where has Pablo Iglesias\u2019 wife worked?, Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital, 14 October 2019). \u2022 Pedro S\u00e1nchez takes his sectarianism to the extreme by not summoning Vox to deal with Catalonia (El Diestro; 16 October 2019).  78 \u2022 Iv\u00e1n Espinosa, the fucking man: \u2018I\u2019m going faster than a feminist to ask for a grant\u2019 (Mediter\u00e1neo Digital, 6 November 2019). \u2022 Vox Makes History: Bringing together 50,000 people at Major Election Campaign Events (ElPatriota; 9 November 2019). The first week of analysis focuses on the Catalan matter because it is a current event at the time. At the same time, in the election campaign, the activity on politicians, their representatives, and the electoral process itself increases in all cases. Catalonia is still present in the election week as well.  Table 6. Mentions to political parties or their members in the periods analysed.

It is followed by VOX (100 references) which, on the contrary, mainly receive positive media coverage (84 out of 100). Mentions to VOX or its speakers increase notably during the election campaigning week, rising from 29 in the first period to 71 in the week before elections. Therefore this content increases by 40%, which is reflected more in El Patriota, the website that covers this party the most. However, this is not the case with the PSOE, despite being the most mentioned party, going from 42 mentions in the first period to 62 in the second one.   79 Podemos is in third place with 30 references, most of them are critical (28 of the 30). Periodista Digital and El Diestro are the sites that make the most references to the PSOE, and El Patriota is the website that cites Podemos the most. Cuidadanos is the party that goes the most unnoticed, while coverage of the P.P. has a more neutral tone, sometimes with sympathetic overtones.  The references to Vox extol the heroism of its spokespeople and external figures who support it. It is identified as the only party capable of solving the Catalan conflict, and numerous contents are dedicated to advancing and analysing the election results, in which the party always comes out as victorious. Regarding the item under analysis \u201cAttacks on Vox,\u201d it rarely appears during the October analysis, while in the campaign week, it features on all four websites, with a total of 16 related publications. The attacks come from both anonymous people, identified as extreme leftists, and from the media (El Pa\u00eds, Cadena Ser and El Espa\u00f1ol) as well as journalists (Jordi \u00c9vole, Julia Otero, Susana Griso) and well-known references (Luc\u00eda Etxebarr\u00eda). El Patriota is the site that most refers to Vox.  PSOE and Podemos are heavily criticised. Sometimes the media enters into personal issues that seek to discredit and defame the parties and their members. They are the targets of insults, and there is no distinction between information and opinion. Some headlines that might seem informative a priori contain opinions and subjective assessments. This is the case on all the websites analysed.  Remarkably, El Diestro, Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital, and Periodista Digital question the authenticity of the electoral process in several news items, no doubt alarmists, they refer to hacking, vote theft, coercion, and suspicion. Democratic functioning seems to be questioned, as shown in the following examples: \u2022 Failure or hacking? The collapse of the postal vote due to a \u201ccomputer error\u201d throughout Spain. (Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital; 8 November 2019). \u2022 Here we go! Mail order votes stolen from a wallet (Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital; 9 November 2019). \u2022 Denunciation of \u201c electoral fraud\u201d in 28-A admitted for processing (Periodista Digital; 1 November 2019). \u2022 The Transparent Election Platform is going to carry out a parallel election recount; if you want to collaborate, these are the instructions (El Diestro; 9 November 2019).

This page, together with El Patriota and El Diestro, feature items that criticise opinion leaders\u2019 attitudes such as the journalists Xavier Xard\u00e1\u2019s, Antonio Garc\u00eda Ferreras\u2019, or Pilar Rahola\u2019s. There are also publications aimed at specific groups such as the Guardia Civil or National Police, which seek support instead of providing information. These contents are almost always related to their intervention in Catalonia.  There are few publications on immigration. However, the coverage of the information in these publications is not objective, as is the case in \u201cIv\u00e1n Espinosa humiliates Susanna Griso live and shows that immigrants are more likely to rape\u201d or \u201cVox supports the citizen who shot at the Maghreb who broke into his house in Murcia: \u201cHe is a brave man,\u201d published by Diario Patriota.  False information that is discredited by the verifier \u201cMaldito Bulo\u00a8, such as \u201cThe report that Abascal speaks of yes, most of those condemned in the manadas are foreigners\u201d published by Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital on 5 November, refers to the false information provided by Santiago Abascal in the electoral debate or the previously mentioned \u201cThe denunciation of the \u201celectoral fraud\u201d on 28-A admitted for processing (Periodista Digital; 1 November 2019).   \n 81 4. Discussion and conclusions Throughout this work the influence of junk news and disinformation media on election campaigns has been analysed, a specific study on two periods of analysis was carried out: a random week in October 2019 and the election campaign week before the 10 November 2019 elections. Spanish pages that usually distribute junk content were identified by the Junk News Aggregator tool from the Oxford Internet Institute. In other words, partisan, ideologically extremist, and propagandistic information. However, after referring to previous research, this first filter lacks sites such as Caso Aislado, Diario de Sevilla, or La Gaceta, among others, previously registered by other experts due to their disinformative activity, as stated in the theoretical framework. A second filter has been applied on Similar Web to limit the content analysis to the most significant websites. It can be seen that the traffic to these pages is mainly direct, and when it comes from social networks, Facebook and Twitter are the platforms that have the biggest audiences.  The contents usually have an anonymous byline such as \u201cnews editorial staff\u201d or the name of the media. In some cases, there is such a high number of collaborators, as is the case of Periodista Digital, which is unrealistic for an independent and small media outlet. There are also fake identities who pretend to be journalists, which has already been reported by the media. It should be noted that authors rarely coincide in both periods of analysis.  Although there is an increase in campaign activity, it is not particularly significant. However, the five websites publish an average of 42.7 daily items, which may contain disinformation during the campaign period. The thematic agenda is altered, increasing the content in the electoral period related to political parties and mentions to them. Catalonia is one of the critical issues in both periods, and on all websites, it is always covered from the perspective of conflict that serves to highlight the government\u2019s incompetence. The government is alleged to be unable to find a solution, and there is said to be a lack of proposals and initiatives from other political parties.  In the content analysis, it is evident that the pages analysed publish items that feature characteristics typical of agitation propaganda, which seek to favour Vox and reinforce its followers, either by criticizing or satirising other parties or by praising their own party, whose coverage increases by 40% during the election campaign. The alleged physical and verbal attacks on both its spokespersons and its supporters appear frequently. Whereas, Vox and its supporters are praised for their courage and bravery for offering alternatives to current policies. There could be correlations or even direct links to Vox\u2019s political discourse since the party has a brand of clothing called \u201cThe Patriot,\u201d coinciding with the name of the site that most refers to the party. The website does not indicate that it is a Vox media or, at least, related to it. This conclusion correlates with the study by Hern\u00e1ndez and Fern\u00e1ndez (2019) that established connections between the site Caso Aislado and Vox.  This disinformation media\u2019s propagandistic approach is demonstrated. However, it would be interesting to study the impact of these junk contents on social networks in the future as well as the interactions generated by them. As we have discussed in the theoretical framework, junk news, not only interferes in the electoral processes but also reduces public debate and limits it to those topics that can benefit their backers.  One might think that categorising these web pages as disinformative to be excessive. However, some elements make this evident, such as taking on the appearance, structure, and the same development as a media outlet so that the audience interprets the contents as such. However, a detailed analysis of the authorship of the works and how the political information is focused has allowed us to identify partisan and propaganda objectives. It is not, therefore, a question of media that sporadically publishes malicious news, but rather publications are sequenced which respond to a political content strategy. In this work, three different periods of analysis are examined (the period determined by Junk News Aggregator and the two applied in the fieldwork), Junk News was found in all periods.  On the other hand, the present study shows that the websites analysed tend to benefit the \u201cright-wing\u201d parties. More work could be done to broaden the sample, the periods of research, and the interactions on their social networks to determine whether they are coordinated and to identify whether other sites carry out similar practices in favour of \u201cleft-wing\u201d parties.  Finally, we must highlight that the contents that question the transparency of the electoral process were found. Democratic and social welfare must be taken into account; therefore, it would be appropriate to study these types of publications from the perspective of the study of beliefs in the future, to determine whether junk news and disinformation media are contributing to generating social polarisation.  82 5.

Case study of news item on climate change Influencia de la percepci\u00f3n \u201clas-noticias-me-encuentran\u201d en la evaluaci\u00f3n de la exactitud, la factualidad y la relevancia. Estudio de caso de una noticia sobre el cambio clim\u00e1tico Dates | Received: 27/02/2030 - Reviewed: 17/04/2020 - In press: 21/04/2020 - Published: 01/07/2020\tAbstract  Resumen This paper analyses the effect of \u2018News-Finds-Me' Perception on the user's assessment of a news item on climate change, both directly and indirectly through news-sharing habits, news-consumption habits, uses and gratifications on social media sites, prior knowledge and attitudes regarding the decision to share said news item. Ninety-six Spanish university students took a survey and were asked to read and rate the quality of a news item on climate change, then to indicate whether they would share that news item on social media. The results show that students with a higher news-finds-me perception tended to rate accuracy and factuality more highly than students with a lower news-finds-me perception. However, relevance was not different between the two groups. Hence, it is concluded that 'News-Finds-Me' Perception lowers the user\u2019s expectations but has no influence on the relevance of the news item. As for sharing intentions, none of the aspects considered in the assessment of the news item had an effect on the decision to share that item.  Este art\u00edculo analiza el efecto de la percepci\u00f3n \u201clas noticias-me-encuentran\u201d en la evaluaci\u00f3n que hace el usuario de una noticia sobre el cambio clim\u00e1tico tanto directamente como indirectamente a trav\u00e9s de aspectos como los h\u00e1bitos en la compartici\u00f3n de noticias, los h\u00e1bitos de consumo de noticias, los usos y gratificaciones en redes sociales, el grado de conocimiento previo y las actitudes preexistentes. Se eval\u00faa asimismo la influencia de estos factores respecto a la decisi\u00f3n de compartir esa noticia. 96 alumnos universitarios espa\u00f1oles rellenaron un cuestionario en el que se les ped\u00eda leer y puntuar la calidad de una noticia sobre el cambio clim\u00e1tico, e indicar si compartir\u00edan esa noticia a trav\u00e9s de las redes sociales. Los resultados muestran que los alumnos con una mayor percepci\u00f3n \u201clas noticias-me-encuentran\u201d tendieron a valorar el art\u00edculo como m\u00e1s factual y exacto que aquellos otros con una percepci\u00f3n menor. Por el contrario, no se hallaron diferencias significativas en la evaluaci\u00f3n de la relevancia entre los dos grupos. Por tanto, se concluye que la percepci\u00f3n \u201clas noticias-me-encuentran\u201d reduce las expectativas de los usuarios sobre la calidad, pero no influye en la percepci\u00f3n de la relevancia de la noticia. En cuanto a la intenci\u00f3n de compartir la noticia, ninguno de los aspectos considerados en la evaluaci\u00f3n de la noticia influy\u00f3 en la decisi\u00f3n de compartirla. \n 86 Keywords  Palabras clave Factuality; News-Finds-Me; News-sharing; quality perception; relevance; Social Media  Factualidad; \u201cLas noticias-me-encuentran\u201d, compartir noticias; percepci\u00f3n de calidad; relevancia; medios sociales  \t\t\t\t1. Introduction Social media has potentially become the most important news distribution channel ever (Dafonte-G\u00f3mez, 2018) and a source for political and civic information among citizens (Anspach, Jennings & Arceneaux, 2019). This trend has gained global dimensions in western countries such as the United States, where at least 68% of people follow news on social media at least occasionally (Matsa & Shearer, 2018), as well as in developing countries (Mitchell, Simmons, Matsa & Silver Laura, 2018). Almost half of Spanish Internet users (48%) usually get news through Facebook (Newman, Fletcher, Kalogeropoulos, Levy & Nielsen, 2018). Social media have also displaced the traditional, unidirectional concept of distribution by the idea of dissemination (Noguera-Vivo, 2018). In this environment, users are no longer the final end of a transmission line but a node inside a wider network (Carlson, 2016). This change means that users play an active role in spreading news by deciding what content and articles they share with their contacts on their different social media profiles.  In this sense, the importance of social media for finding news has led to the so-called 'News-Finds-Me Perception' (NFM Perception), that is, the belief that there is no need to actively follow traditional mass media to keep abreast of events, since social media provides the user with the relevant information (Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Weeks & Ard\u00e8vol-Abreu, 2017). It has been warned that this reliance on social media has negative civic effects, as it is linked to lower levels of political knowledge and political participation (Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga & Diehl, 2018; Shehata & Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, 2018). On the other hand, due to the fast pace of change in news consumption patterns driven by social media and new technologies, we know little about the possible sharing patterns and the impact of social media on peoples' experiences of news distribution. Previous research shows that the decision to share news items on social media is deeply related to message characteristics (Trilling, Tolochko & Burscher, 2017). Specifically, the perceived quality of content [Singer, 2014] and the perceived relevance of the topic (Ma, Sian Lee & Hoe-Lian Goh, 2014) have been highlighted as characteristics that stimulate news sharing on social media.  Message characteristics alone, however, do not fully explain the phenomenon of news sharing. To obtain a fuller picture of this behaviour, it is necessary to take into account personal traits. For example, research has shown that people tend to consume media and information that are consistent with their own views and beliefs, a phenomenon known as 'selective exposure' or \u2018confirmation bias\u2019 in psychology (Cappella, Kim & Albarrac\u00edn, 2015). Today\u2019s news media environment, exemplified by the relevance of user-distributed content on social media, has seen the emergence of a parallel trend: 'selective sharing' or the extent to which individuals share primarily attitude-consistent content with their social networks (Shin & Thorson, 2017). According to this phenomenon, prior attitudes towards a certain topic influences the kind of media content that users share and distribute on social media (Barnidge, 2015).  Users are not only influenced by the type of media they consume but also by the type of content and concrete uses they seek through these media (McLeod, 2000). In this sense, the Uses and Gratifications Theory (U&GT) helps to explain different patterns of media behaviour and different effects (Segado-Boj, D\u00edaz-Campo & Quevedo-Redondo, 2019). This theory posits that individuals have an innate need that can be satisfied through media usage.  U&GT has been demonstrated to moderate certain effects (Segado-Boj, D\u00edaz-Campo & Navarro-Sierra, 2020), as happens with selective selection and exposure. Previous studies (Hart, Albarrac\u00edn, Eagly, Brechan, Lindberg & Merrill 2009; Knobloch-Westerwick & Kleinman, 2012) have shown that this type of bias has a lower impact when users are mainly motivated by seeking information. However, these are not the only gratifications that influence media sharing attitudes. Socially focused gratifications are related to both news internalizing (Winter, Metzger & Flanagin, 2016) and news externalizing (Picone, De Wolf & Robijt, 2016).  87  1.1 Objectives and hypothesis Previous studies have found that people relying on social media have different political views and opinions (Lee, Lindsey & Kim, 2017) and that people with heavier exposure to political information on Facebook attribute different salience to political issues (Feezell, 2018). Even though NFM Perception has been assumed to lower users\u2019 standards for the news sources they receive information from (Spohr, 2017), there is a gap in the literature regarding how dependence on social media influences the perception and evaluation of news items. Thus, the first aim of this study is to understand how NFM Perception influences this assessment of journalistic products. We suggest that users with different levels of NFM Perception will assess the quality of a news item differently. A second objective for the research is to measure how this evaluation of the news item influences the decision to share said news article on social media. Understanding the logic of \"why people share news\" is a key to understanding the societal impact of social media (Singer, 2014) and how news travels (Khuntia, Sun & Yim, 2016). Granted that the quality perception of news influences the intention to share news (Ma et al., 2014), we expect that users\u2019 different qualities of assessment will have an influence on the decision to share (or not to share) the proposed new item. The study thus seeks to evaluate how 'NFM Perception' influences the perceived relevance, accuracy and factuality of news about climate change. In addition, it measures the moderating role of uses and gratifications, news habits, prior knowledge and attitudes on climate on that influence. Finally, it aims to check whether changes on the evaluation of that piece of news increase or decrease the individual's decision to share that item on social media.  Hence, we posit hypothesis H1: 'NFM Perception influences the perceived relevance, accuracy and factuality of news on climate change'. Additionally, the present paper explores the impact of the moderating role where by some aspects, as expounded in the introduction, affect the user\u2019s perception of news. Therefore, we decided to test two additional hypotheses:  H1.1. Use & Gratification (U&G) moderates the effect of NFM Perception regarding the perceived relevance, accuracy and factuality of the news item on climate change. H1.2. News habits on social media moderate the effect of NFM Perception regarding the perceived relevance, accuracy and quality of the news item on climate change. As mentioned, social media not only serve as a news consumption venue but also as a secondary distribution channel. Choi (2016a) suggests that users' social media activity is differentiated between news internalizing (how people receive news on social media) and news externalizing (how users share news on social media). It has been confirmed that prior knowledge of a topic has a strong role on the decision to read news that users are incidentally exposed to on social media (Karnowski, K\u00fcmpel, Leonhard & Leiner, 2017). H1.3. Attitudes towards the topic moderate the effect of NFM Perception regarding the perceived relevance, accuracy and factuality of news on climate change. H1.4. Prior knowledge of the topic moderates the effect of the NFM Perception regarding the perceived relevance, accuracy and factuality of the news item on climate change. Lastly, we consider that higher perceptions of quality lead to higher chances of considering a news item.  H2. Higher perceived relevance, accuracy and factuality correlates to higher chances that a news item is shared on social media. Figure 1 summarizes the proposed initial model for this research.    88 Figure 1. Research model \n Source: Own elaboration  1.2 Justification  While much of the literature focuses on the information source and the message characteristics, it omits the receiver's role in sharing news (Shi, Lai, Hu & Chen, 2017). The present study, however, attempts to evaluate the role played by the user's assessment of a news item when deciding whether to share an item on climate change. This research also considers the role of self-presentational concerns, which has been linked to users\u2019 self-disclosure on Facebook of political concerns (Liu, Rui & Cui, 2017). In this context, we predict that uses and gratifications associated with self-presentation would moderate the role of NFM Perception, since such content is a strategic subject in building and projecting self-identity on the Internet (Jensen Schau & Gilly, 2003).  Furthermore, this paper goes beyond the realm of political communication, which is the type of information most studied from the perspective of information circulation on social media (Bene, 2017; Bode, 2017; Hasell & Weeks, 2016; Segado-Boj, 2020; Weeks, Lane, Kim, Lee & Kwak, 2017) to include other kinds of news stories that might trigger different reactions in users and affect the way they are shared (Ma et al., 2014). Thus, surveying information unrelated to political communication could help to improve our knowledge of social media dissemination routines and motivations (Schweisberger, Billinson & Chock, 2014). Lastly, by considering a set of factors that includes users and message characteristics, our study takes a multifaceted approach that overcomes the limitations of monotonous approaches that preclude us from identifying how different factors influence one another (Son, Lee & Kim, 2013).  2. Material and methods An online self-administered questionnaire was used, as this method allowed us to include relational and social aspects of news sharing on social media, as suggested by previous studies (Kalsnes & Larsson, \n 89 2018). The design of the questionnaire, the informed consent and the procedures to collect and analyse the data gathered from the participants were approved by the research ethics office in the corresponding author's University. The first page of the online questionnaire provided information about the study, to which all the participants gave their informed consent to participate by clicking \u201cnext\u201d to begin the survey. Data were later analyzed anonymously. The questionnaire was sent to a sample (n = 96) of undergraduate students selected from universities in the Madrid region, recruited by a social studies firm (Societae). To avoid similar academic backgrounds, the students were selected from different degree courses. To encourage participation, each participant was offered a \u20ac25 gift voucher upon successfully completing the survey. The sample comprised 61.46% women and 38.54% men, with an average age of 20.23 years (SD = 3). Young people provide a relevant subject for study, not only because younger adults are particularly active news sharers on social media but also because this news sharing is likely to remain a key feature of news distribution models (Bobkowski, 2015). The responses to the survey were collected from May 5th to July 3rd, 2017.  The participants responded to several sets of questions detailed in Tables 1-5. After those questions were submitted, participants were asked to read a news item on the effects of climate change (La Vanguardia, 2017). The text and images of the item included no reference to its source or any other context. After reading the news item, the participants were asked whether they would share that \u2018news item\u2019 on social media. Finally, they were asked to rate the perceived relevance of the new item.  2.1 Measurements This section details the measures and scales used in the study. Cronbach's alpha is indicated in each Table by the symbol \u03b1. 'News-finds-me' Perception was measured by the sum of the responses to a set of four questions (Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 201)] through a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = lowest agreement, 7 = highest agreement) (see Table 1).

In addition, concern about climate change was measured as a single item question (1 = \"not concerned at all\", 7 = \"very concerned\"; average = 5.81, SD = 1.27) as well as interest in news about science (1 = \"not interested at all\", 7 = \"very interested\"; average = 4.92, SD = 1.59).

We measured three different constructs (accuracy, factuality and relevance) on a 7-pointLikert-type scale (1 = lowest agreement; 7 = highest agreement), as shown in Table 6.     91 Table 6. Measurements for quality of a news item Accuracy (SD=1.51) The news item provides accurate and exact information Factuality (\u03b1 = 0.9) The news item provides fact-based information The news item provides credible information Relevance (\u03b1 = 0.87)  The news item provides information that should be known by the general public The news item provides information that I should know  The news item provides information that should be known by political leaders Source: Authors, based on Sundar, 1999  Regarding data analysis, linear regression was chosen when the dependent variable was continuous. Ordinal regression was applied when the dependent variable was discreet. Such statistical tests are commonly applied in similar studies in Communication (Chyi & Yang, 2009; Stempel, Hargrove & Stempel, 2007), as well as in other disciplines (Kaufman, Dwyer, Land, Klein & Park, 2018; Kirk, Ng, Lee, Ang & Lee, 2015) that measure relationships between perceptions and evaluations of messages of issues and other constructs or features. To determine whether a variable is a moderator, the biostatistical Penn State University model was used. According to this model, when a coefficient considering a third variable changes more than 10% from the coefficient without that third variable, itis taken as a moderator. The formula applied was: % !\"#$\"%$&'\t=\t*!\"#$%&'(\t*+\t,+-./0'+/\t10/&023.\t4!\"#$\t%&'(\t,+-./0'+/\t10/&023.!\"#$\t%&'(\t*+\t,+-./0'+/\t10/&023.+x\t100 Tables 7-9 show moderating variables in bold characters. Coefficients reaching statistical significance are indicated by an asterisk. Also, starting from the defined structure of direct and indirect effects, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis has been applied to validate the initial theoretical model. The analysis was implemented in the IBM AMOS 23 software. To validate data, the assumption of multivariate normality has been tested by analyzing the multivariate kurtosis index and the corresponding critical ratio. A critical ratio below 5 indicates that the multivariate normality assumption is fulfilled (Bentler, 2004). In this case, the critical ratio is 1.890, which points to maximum likelihood for the estimation. However, as the sample size is small and the model includes categorical variables, a Bayesian estimation process has been followed to avoid assumptions on the a priori distribution of the estimated parameters (Byrne, 2009). The analysis has been developed into two main stages. In the first, the initial, null, and saturated models were estimated. The first model reflects the relationship among variables. The null model assumes no relationships among the variables, thus reflecting the worst possible outcome. The saturated model assumes that every parameter is significantly different from zero, which implies full adjustment of the whole dataset (Gaviria Soto, Bienciento L\u00f3pez & Navarro, 2009). In the second phase, the initial model was modified to improve the adjustment by discarding non-significant effects and studying the modification indexes derived.  The model adjustment was tested through the following indexes: \u2022 Absolute adjustment index. The index analyzes how the model adjusts to the observed data. In other words, it indicates whether the underlying theory adjusts to the sample data. The Chi square value is divided by the degrees of freedom of the model (CMIN/df). Values below 2 are considered very good, while those between 3 and 5 acceptable. GFI values above 0.9 are also accepted (Hair, Black, Babin & Anderson, 2014). \u2022 Incremental adjustment indexes. These indexes assess the improvements to the independence model through the CFI index. Values above 0.95 are considered good (Byrne, 2009). \u2022 Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). This index compares the adjustment between the proposed model and hypothetical population data. In this case, values above 0.05 are considered very good, and those between 0.05 and 0.08, acceptable (Byrne, 2009).     92 3. Results  3.1 Influence of \u201cNews-Finds-Me\u201d Perception 3.1.1 Influence on the perceived accuracy of the climate change news item As Figure 2 shows, the NFM Perception influences the perceived accuracy of the news item under study. Based on a simple ordinal regression model, the associated odds ratio was 1.1366, indicating it reached statistical significance (95% confidence interval: 1.0526, 1.2298). That means that the higher the users rate the NFM Perception, the more likely (13% for each point of the scale) it is they will perceive the quality of the news item as higher.  This is not valid for all the values of the 7-point Likert-type scale (see Figure 2), however, because users are not able to determine very precisely what \u201caccuracy\u201d is, since this trend is clearer for values lower and higher than 4.  Figure 2.

This means that when users rated a higher NFM Perception, they also rated the news item with higher factuality (0.1939 points as standard average growth) (see Figure 3). Figure 3.

The RMSEA value also falls within the acceptable margins.  4. Discussion The results show that higher NFM Perception is related to higher evaluations of accuracy and factuality. We interpret this finding as evidence that NFM lowers the user's expectations towards news items.  Information seeking has the most relevant moderating role regarding the influence of NFM on this regard (see Table 8), but when considering relevance on its own, the most important moderating role comes from social interaction (see Table 9). This could be explained by the different aspects implied in each value. As relevance measures many factors, among them an external aspect ('The news item provides information that should be known by the general public'), social interaction U&G may encourage this attitude and behaviour. On the other hand, information seeking could moderate the influence of NFM Perception because users with higher informational needs might have more criteria to evaluate the factuality of the news item, given their higher information literacy or familiarity with journalism products. Further research is needed.   99 Although self-presentational U&G led to higher self-disclosure in political issues (Liu et al., 2017), self-expression and impression management play a minor moderating role compared to the most influential U&G (Information Seeking and Social Interaction).  Thus, relevance is more related to social interaction, whereas the link between self-presentational U&G and political news sharing might be better explained by personal and psychological aspects.  News internalizing plays a stronger moderating role than news externalizing, thus substantiating the suggestion that consumption habits are more relevant to the perception of news and topics than sharing habits are. In other words, users who attach greater importance to social media as a means to stay informed and receive more news through social media, tend to have different perceptions and assessments of a news story.  Attitudes towards climate change were shown to have a greater moderating role than prior knowledge did. In fact, the idea that climate change is a phenomenon provoked by humans that can be halted led to a higher factuality and relevance assessment. Prior knowledge, in contrast, did not exert a moderating role. This could imply a link between attitudes and perception towards the topic and the relevance of climate change, thus suggesting a need to share information about the topic.  The perception of responsibility as well as the possibility to halt climate change leads to different attitudes towards this topic (Chang, Kim, Shim & Ma, 2016), which as demonstrated here, also moderate the other influences regarding the willingness to share the information about this topic. In contrast, the NFM Perception does not directly influence the relevance of the news topic. Although higher exposure to political news on social media led to higher levels of interest in political issues (Feezell, 2018), our findings suggest that such exposure must occur to be effective. In other words, the simple dependence users have on social media for receiving news does not increase users\u2019 interests or relevance given to social or political issues. Regarding news sharing, our model shows that the assessment of the news item had almost no relevance in the decision to share or not to share it on social media. This is consistent with previous findings that maintain that topic relevance takes precedence over news credibility when users decide to share a link or news item [Ma et al., 2014]. This is especially relevant, given that NFM Perception might increase the reliance on untrustworthy sources of information, as misinformation and low quality information circulates through social media (Gil De Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Huber & Strau\u00df, 2018).  4.1 Conclusion Our findings could mean that NFM Perception might affect the assessment of journalistic pieces and products, since accuracy and factuality are aspects inherent to news reports. However, topical relevance is not so dependent on the way people acquire their news.  In this sense, almost every other factor considered in our model (media habits, prior knowledge and attitudes, uses and gratifications) moderates the influence of NFM Perception in topic relevance assessment (see Table 8 and Figure 8). This points that relevance attribution is a complex phenomenon that requires models of greater complexity to be understood and that NFM Perception does not play a relevant role.  Although NFM Perception might explain differences in the perception of textual characteristics of news (accuracy, factuality), aspects related to topic relevance are not directly affected by this construct.  According to our results, users might share information regardless of its accuracy or factuality. In other words, other factors external to the journalistic quality of the news item itself might be what truly matter in news sharing. This is meaningful for understanding the way in which misleading information is distributed on social media  4.2. Limitations and further research Cronbach`s \u03b1 measurement of news internalizing and NFM Perception, ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, was below the ideal value, although it qualifies them as acceptable constructs (DeVellis, 2017).  This study used a single-message design, which does not reflect the complexity of media effects and reception. Future studies could develop a design in which multiple messages are used as a stimulus.  100 Additionally, given the size of the sample and the variability on the considered variables, which combine numeral and ordinal variables, it is impossible to normalize the measures and build an integral research model that could reflect marginal changes.  Regarding the sample, all the participants are undergraduate students. This implies than results could only be extrapolated to this sociodemographic sector. Regardless, young adults are a relevant subject of study given their strong orientation towards online news and news sharing on social media (Antunovic, Parsons & Cooke, 2018). Although prior attitudes and knowledge were measured, prior general interest towards the topic was not surveyed. This construct has been shown to be a motivating factor for engaging with news (K\u00fcmpel, 2018); therefore, future research should incorporate it to better understand the role of NFM Perception in news assessments.  As already mentioned, attitudes towards the topic were shown to play a relevant moderating role. Future studies should respond to or adapt the study to ascertain whether the identified tendencies appear in other socially relevant or controversial news topics.  We also mentioned that psychological aspects may help to improve our understanding of the link between the willingness to share information and uses and gratifications, which has been observed in studies on the effects of media (Ngai, Tao & Moon, 2015). Considering some psychological features and constructs such as the big five personality traits might help to gain further insight into the current topic.  5.

The aim is to contribute to understanding of the phenomenon by clarifying the responsibility incurred by journalists as professional news broadcasters. Exploratory research was conducted on news published in newspapers in recent years and subsequently unmasked as fake news. Accordingly, a classification model of disinformation phenomena from the journalist\u2019s intention as sender was established. In addition, a review of paradigmatic cases helping to systematise the distinctive features of journalistic texts containing fake news and, subsequently, not disseminating quality information, was performed. The lack of a repository of false news originating from, or disseminated by newspapers, limited the conclusions drawn. However, the proposed study paradigm helps to delimit the position of journalists in the phenomenon of disinformation, provides an alert to the presence of obvious signs of disinformation in texts not designed for this purpose and, hence, shows the need to expand the concept of disinformation itself to encompass unintended false news.   La repercusi\u00f3n de las noticias falsas en la p\u00e9rdida de credibilidad period\u00edstica y la alarma social que suscitan enmarcan esta investigaci\u00f3n. El objetivo es contribuir a la comprensi\u00f3n del fen\u00f3meno dilucidando qu\u00e9 responsabilidad tienen en \u00e9l los periodistas como emisores profesionales de noticias. Se ha realizado una investigaci\u00f3n de tipo exploratorio sobre noticias publicadas en peri\u00f3dicos en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os y desenmascaradas como noticias falsas, de la que se sigue la formulaci\u00f3n de un modelo clasificatorio de fen\u00f3menos desinformativos desde la intenci\u00f3n del emisor periodista, y la revisi\u00f3n de casos paradigm\u00e1ticos que ayuden a sistematizar los rasgos distintivos de textos period\u00edsticos que encierren noticias falseadas y, por tanto, no trasmitan informaci\u00f3n de calidad. Las limitaciones de este trabajo vienen dadas por la carencia de un repositorio de noticias falsas originadas o difundidas por los peri\u00f3dicos; no obstante, el paradigma de estudio que se propone ayuda a delimitar la posici\u00f3n de los periodistas en el fen\u00f3meno de la desinformaci\u00f3n, alerta de la presencia de signos evidentes de desinformaci\u00f3n en textos que no tienen por qu\u00e9 estar concebidos con tal fin y, por ello, plantea la necesidad de ampliar el concepto mismo de la desinformaci\u00f3n para incluir noticias falsas no intencionadas.

Introduction The impact of fake news on political events in 2016 prompted the European Commission to consult a high-level group of experts in January of 2018 regarding the policies needed to counteract the impact of so-called \u2018fake news\u2019, as well as other types of disinformation transmitted through digital channels. This action was joined with previous initiatives promoted by EU institutions as well, such as the creation of the East Stratcom Task Force in March of 2015 (European Council, 2015) to counteract the impact of disinformation campaigns launched mainly from Russia. These kinds of operations have disclosed the fact that the phenomenon of fake news is a real and far-reaching threat to our societies. Institutional concern runs parallel to the feeling of uncertainty among European citizens, 83% of whom say that fake news is a threat to the stability of democracy (European Commission, 2018). The most recent findings confirm this global concern regarding fake news, although considerable polarisation has been observed recently among countries with distinct contexts. For example, with regard to the ability to discern what is real and false on the Internet, this number reaches 85% of the citizens of Brazil, 70% in the United Kingdom, and 67% in the United States, but these figures drop to 38% in Germany and 31% in the Netherlands (Reuters Institute, 2019).  Measures to combat disinformation proposed by the group of experts that was consulted by the European Commission serve five purposes: 1. Improve the transparency of online news; 2. Promote media literacy; 3. Develop tools to empower users and journalists to deal with disinformation; 4. Safeguard the diversity and sustainability of the European media ecosystem; and 5. Promote continuous research on the impact of disinformation in Europe (European Council, 2018).  In line with the latter recommendation, this article aims to contribute to the investigation of this phenomenon and to counterbalance the dominant perspective, as the scientific research regarding fake news carried out in the United States is double that of the rest of the world combined (Blanco, Garc\u00eda and Tejedor, 2019). Thus, this study attempts to enrich the understanding of the phenomenon by focusing on professional communication media in order to elucidate their responsibility in this matter. The large number of studies on fake news disseminated through social networks have diluted the cases that have occurred in professional journalistic settings, the latter of which are just as striking, once discovered, as those described in the following paragraphs.  On 22 December of 2018, the prestigious German magazine Der Spiegel published a special issue after having suffered one of the most notorious and recent journalistic frauds in the era of fake news (Carbajosa, 2019). However, this case can only be considered a recent example of a reality that seems to be increasingly rooted in the journalistic profession: the loss of quality in published information and the consequent deterioration of the credibility of the press.  For some experts (FAPE, 2016; Lepore, 2019), it seems clear that this loss of credibility is related to competition from social networks and other media such as television, but not because competition forces some of these organizations to reposition themselves while the press loses credit that others gain, but because some of the realities that inflict the most damage on journalism have found their breeding ground in the emotion of the screens, as well as in the speed and ease of access to networks.  There is no doubt that media convergence has brought about a cultural change (Jenkins, 2008). According to Emily Bell (2016), the main consequence of this change has been the loss of news distribution control by the professional media, which has been an advantage for Facebook. This loss of control in social mediation by journalists is one explanation for the general distrust of information, but not the only one. According to the latest Digital News Report, the average level of trust in news dropped two points in 2019 to 42%; only 49% of respondents say they trust the media they consume, a figure that drops to 23% when it comes to news found on social networks (Reuters Institute, 2019).  We can infer from these data that even though the loss of credibility of the media is relevant, journalists continue to retain much of their influence in the public sphere, even doubling the level of trust by the public in their information compared to news disseminated on social networks, despite having lost the monopoly on news distribution.  The new reality that demoscopic research starkly reveals would be at the base of the informational disorders that are driving the digitised society. None of the phenomena that undermine journalistic credibility is new: neither the so-called fake news, nor sensationalism, nor even the tendency to \u2018show off\u2019, but let us say that they all seem to be living through a golden age at the hand of social networks.   107 The identification of fake news on social networks has become an emerging line of research, which is gaining the attention of much of the scientific community, as noted above (Shu et al., 2017; Blanco et al., 2019). However, for the purpose of this article, we will depart from this concept and proceed with two correlated phases: firstly, we will delve into the very concept of fake news and the typologies studied up to the present time in order to know exactly what we mean when we speak of fake news; Secondly, we will direct our research toward the analysis of fake news produced in professional journalistic settings in order to construct a paradigm of these informational disorders from the perspective of the context in which messages are created as well as the intention of the sender.   2. State of the issue: moving toward a definition of fake news The consumption of news through digital media is a two-sided coin: advantages such as access to content that is free, immediate, ubiquitous, permanent, and unlimited (Garc\u00eda Avil\u00e9s, 2017), coexist with risks such as the proliferation of fake news.  However, as previously pointed out, fake news is not characterised by its novelty, but by the virtual context that has allowed it to become more widespread. In fact, in her book entitled La Noticia (The News), Mar de Fontcuberta as early as 1993 defined \u201cnon-event\u201d as the construction, production and dissemination of news based on events that had never happened. In her book entitled 21 Lecciones de reporterismo (21 Lessons of Reporting), Bezunartea (1998) presented the typology of this \u201cnon-event\u201d, which today could be considered a typology of fake news, as follows: 1. Invented news: based on elements, declarations, or hypotheses that do not exist in reality, and which are not subsequently corrected by the media; 2. Erroneous news, built on data that has been revealed as true yet turns out to be false and recognised as such (the error may come from insufficient information, incorrect interpretation of available data by the journalist, or an attitude of deliberate disinformation by the news source); and 3. News based on speculation. This is news built upon unproven hypotheses or unconfirmed rumours.  By reviewing 34 scientific articles published between 2003 and 2017, the most recent work by Tandoc, Limand and Ling (2018) has identified a typology of fake news based on two levels: the level of fact (truth), and the level of deception. Next, they established five types of fake news: satirical, parody, fabrication, manipulation, and advertising/propaganda.  Likewise, Ruchansky, Seo and Liu (2017) have established three common elements in fake news: the user or source promoting it, the text, and the response of the user receiving it. These three elements are the starting point for a classification of fake news that makes a distinction between news based on the interests of the source, sponsored content, and fabricated stories (Thompson Rivers University Library, 2018; Shu et al., 2017).  Shariatmadari (2019) treats language as a characteristic element of fake news. Based on this factor, Fatemeh Torabi Asr (2019) discovered that on average, fake news utilizes more words related to sex, death, anxiety, as well as overly emotional language. By contrast, authentic news contains a higher proportion of words related to work (business) and money (economy).  Along the same lines, another group of researchers (Rashking et al., 2017) analysed the relationship between several grammatical categories and fake news in the political context. They concluded that words used for exaggeration are most often found in deliberately misleading news stories. These included superlative expressions such as \u201cthe majority\u201d, and \u201cthe worst\u201d, and so-called subjective expressions (qualifying adjectives implying appraisal or subjectivity), such as \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cterrible\u201d. They pointed out that propaganda tends to use abstract generalities such as \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d, and showed that the use of the second-person pronoun \u201cyou\u201d was closely related to fake news.  Authors such as Derakhshan and Wardle (2017) follow along the same lines as Ruchansky, Seo and Liu (2017) in establishing the three elements of what they call information disorder: 1. Agent: Who were the \u201cagents\u201d that created, produced and distributed the content, and what was their motivation; 2.Message: What kind of message was it? What format did it have? What were its features? and 3. Interpreter: When someone received the message, how did they interpret it? What actions did they take? From these elements, they established seven categories of content: 1. satire or parody, 2. Misleading, 3. fraudulent, 4. fabricated, 5. false connection, 6. false context, and 7. manipulated content.  As for the receiver, Vosoughi et al. (2018) started from a set of 126,000 rumours published on Twitter between 2006 and 2017, reaching about three million people. They concluded that fake news reached an audience of between one thousand and one hundred thousand people, while real news on rare occasion reached  108 one thousand. Falsehood also spreads faster than the truth. According to these authors, the degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of the receivers could explain the size of these numbers, or in other words, fake news appears to be fuelled by the individual prejudices or emotions of the users (this is the third element described by Ruchansky et al., 2017).  There are authors who start with the purpose of fake news as a variable for its classification, thus following the approach of Derakhshan and Wardle (2017) regarding the motivation of the receiver. Kalsnes (2018) identifies three main motivations for the publication of fake news: political, economic and social. Political disinformation, often referred to as propaganda, is intended to influence public opinion, while economic disinformation attempts to make a profit. Social motivation refers to variables such as status, fame, attention, identity-building, entertainment, or acceptance among an online community.  It is well-known that two communicative processes converge in journalistic information: the first one is established between the source and the journalist, where the former takes the role of sender and the latter is the receiver; the second process is carried out between the journalist and the public, in which the former plays the role of sender and the latter is the receiver. However, as noted by Chen, Conroy and Rubin (2015), the boundaries between the production, creation and exchange of information are gradually becoming blurred in the digital media context, producing what might be considered an alternative to the traditional information flow in which the source comes directly to the receiver without the mediation of professional journalism.  By reviewing the role of sources in the complex world of disinformation, the idea appears that sometimes the source is the origin of fabricated or manipulated news that is disseminated with or without the collaboration of the journalist. However, beyond the intention of the source, our proposal analyses the intent of journalistic issuers in their dual role of being the receiver of information from sources and the issuer of information to the public.  The effect that fake news is having on the press has led us to pose the first hypothesis, which states that the phenomenon of disinformation manifests itself differently in the well-established media where its presence is reduced to isolated cases, contrary to what is observed on social networks. Having knowledge of fake news in which the origin has been verified allows us to observe its characteristics and describe its structure. From here, a second hypothesis has been formulated that will guide the research: by analysing fake news produced in professional journalistic settings, it is possible to infer the psychological attitude of the journalist who created it, as well as his or her role in the disinformation.  It is important to emphasise this professional profile, since the fact that a fake news item produced by a journalist multiplies exponentially its possible damage. All protocols for the containment of fake news point to the identification of the source as the first step in verifying the authenticity of the news. In this sense, when the source is a journalist, the detection of fake news becomes highly complex, as it emanates from a professional news channel. At this point, a third hypothesis of this investigation can be inferred: the detection of fake news produced in professional journalistic settings is more complex, and its detection is only possible when there is a specific complaint that unmasks the falsehood.   3. Methodology Empirical research on the nature of fake news presents a methodological difficulty: the lack of a repository of fake news published in reference journals. At the present time, there are two well-known fact-checking agencies operating in Spain: Newtral and Maldita.es. Both agencies were contacted by the authors, and even though neither of them has a systemised inventory of fake news produced by professional journalistic media, their collaboration facilitated access to their databases in an attempt to obtain a list of news items with these characteristics that would have appeared in one of the daily newspapers with the largest circulation in Spain. The fact that these platforms do not classify fake news according to the medium where it is published makes the search difficult. Moreover, as pointed out by the people in charge, their way of proceeding consists of interacting with large communities of followers who feed their knowledge base with suspicious messages seen on social networks, and consequently, the routine work of verification is determined by the very virality of the hoaxes and falsehoods that flood the public digital space. In other words, these agencies do not systematically verify the content published by the media. Perhaps for this reason, the tracking they carry out using the names of the newspapers themselves as key words, along with the concept of fake  109 news, provided only a dozen cases in which the publication was not actually used as a means of disseminating fake news, but simply repeated the fraud. Therefore, this lack of a systemised repository of unmasked fake news, and more specifically, false news emanating from professional journalistic settings, as well as the impossibility of directly verifying the published news, forced us to revise the search and limit it to the tracking of cases revealed by the media themselves, establishing an ad hoc system for their selection based on the two following criteria: 1. That these news stories would have been published in the press, and 2. That they would have been unmasked as fake news, either by the same medium that broadcast it or by another medium. In order not to limit the analysis, in this first study the decision was made not to introduce restrictive variables that were geographical, time related or linguistic in nature. With these assumptions, exploratory and explanatory research was carried out. Exploratory was selected because it aims to study a phenomenon that is not yet clearly defined due to its novelty. In this sense, the conclusions can serve as a starting point for further research to verify or refute the paradigm proposed herein. Explanatory was also chosen because it consists of research that tries to describe the causes that give rise to certain events (Del R\u00edo and Vel\u00e1zquez, 2005), such as fake news produced by professional journalists. Thirty-two journalistic texts related to fourteen cases in the news were reviewed, which ranged from fabrication to a lack of contrast, and even to an obvious attempt to manipulate in some of them. We reiterate the fact that the novelty of this study lies in the object of analysis, or in other words, journalists as transmitters of fake news, an area that has in fact been studied only slightly up until the present time, as most of the current knowledge about this phenomenon comes from studies of fake news disseminated through social networks by unknown issuers. The results of the empirical research and the very dynamics of the cases analysed have led to the formulation of a paradigm not initially foreseen: The DMI paradigm, an acronym that means Deceive, Manipulate, and Inform. This relates to the three intentions we have identified in the process of creating a journalistic message. From a methodological point of view, the analysis of fake news based on the DMI paradigm has been very practical, given that the intellectual attitude of the issuer can only be inferred by a third party a posteriori based on the published content.   4. Results: the DMI paradigm Claire Wardle, a world-renowned expert in fact checking and the creator of First Draft (2017), establishes three components of the disinformation process: the type of false content published, the method of dissemination, and the motivation of the creators. This research herein has used the third element, the motivation of the one who creates the message, as the starting point in constructing the DMI paradigm: Deceive, Manipulate, and Inform.  The aim of this taxonomy is to help in arranging the complex labyrinth of disinformation and to clarify the journalist\u2019s responsibility in the situation. In many cases, the place occupied by a certain disinformation phenomenon in this continuum of falsification or deterioration of information depends on the attitude of the issuer.  According to this paradigm, fake news produced in professional journalistic settings may result from three different intellectual attitudes of the journalist- deceptive, manipulative, and informative. Each attitude masks an intention included in the DMI paradigm with different results: 1. the journalist tries to deceive: invented or fabricated news; 2. the journalist tries to manipulate: biased or inaccurate news; and 3. the journalist tries to inform: news that is erroneous or mistaken.  A common element in these three types of fake news is that they result from professional malpractice. From the Journalist\u2019s Creed, published in 1915 by the University of Missouri School of Journalism (Farrar, 1998), to the Global Charter of Ethics for Journalists (June 2019), to the FAPE Code of Ethics (approved in 1993 and updated in 2017) in Spain, or to the European Code of Ethics for the Journalistic Profession (N\u00fa\u00f1ez Encabo, 1993), the requirement of accurate and verified information has established the duty of the professional journalist in transmitting the truth, in not concealing data, and even in exercising caution with regard to the way in which information from social networks should be handled. There is even a warning included in the latest code, which insists that neither urgency nor immediacy justify the lack of verification of data to be published.  110 Bearing in mind what has been established by these four deontological documents, it is now possible to presuppose a list of news that deviate from information and feed disinformation: fabricated news, rumours, slanted news in headlines and texts, news that mixes opinion and information, partial information (hides versions that are necessary for knowing the whole truth about something), news that has false or erroneous data, and news with unclear and imprecise expressions.  Therefore, since we could only obtain an inventory (never finished) of false news depending on the type of error involved, we have proposed the DMI paradigm in order to solve this methodological problem, since by examining the three journalistic attitudes regarding this inventory of fake news, the vision of the phenomenon is simplified. Let us look at them one by one.  Table 1. DMI Paradigm   Intention of the journalist Action Information disorder Type of fake news D Deceive  Conscious alteration of the truth  Fictional stories resulting from the journalist\u2019s deception  Invented or fabricated news  M Manipulate Conscious alteration of the truth Narratives corrupted by biased and slanted intentions of the editor  Biased or manipulated news  I Inform  Unconscious alteration of  the truth  Erroneous narratives in which the  journalist had the honest intention of informing   Inaccurate or imprecise news  Source: Created by the authors \t4.1. D for deceive The meaning of the word \u2018deceive\u2019, found in DRAE (2019), is very clear: \u201cTo give the lie the appearance of truth\u201d, and \u201cto induce someone to believe something is true when it is not, by using words or deeds that only seem credible, or are feigned\u201d. From this premise, the journalist\u2019s intention would be to deceive the reader, offering him or her a fabricated news item; the reporter wants to pass off something as true when it is not. The news that emerges from this information disorder is invented or fabricated, and because it is the most striking and daring, it is the easiest to detect and the one that causes the most stupefaction.  Therefore, in this category we include fake news composed of stories belonging to the realm of fiction rather than fact, which include testimonies that did not occur, interviews that were not conducted, sources that did not exist, and so on. This is the case of star reporter Caarl Relotious of the prestigious German magazine Der Spiegel, previously mentioned, who fabricated data and testimonies in at least fourteen of his own investigations (Carbajosa, 2019). This is a journalistic practice that has affected other pillars of international journalism, such as The New York Times, whose reporter Jayson Blair published at least thirty-six fake news articles (Piquer, 2003).  Examples in which the journalist deliberately lies are the most scandalous, because \u201cthe first ethical commitment of a journalist is to respect the truth\u201d (FAPE, 2017). This type of deception involves making someone believe that something false is actually true. One can speak of journalistic fraud (Sehat, 2017), or even informational shamelessness, and we can also distinguish two types of information: 1. That which is deliberately false, and 2. That which combines true elements with false content. Both types are often low-cost information produced without any on-site reporting, and originates from the fantasy of the journalist who tries to reach a large audience, and in the two cases involving Blair and Relotius, this swells in an unrestrained spiral until they are discovered. The result of combining false data with true data is just as far from the truth as the one that gathers only false data.  The intention to deceive was also evident in the conviction of El Mundo journalist Javier Negre in a story that was published in the newspaper diario16.com on November 13, 2019 with the headline, \u201cJavier Negre (El Mundo) sentenced for fabricating an interview with the ex-girlfriend of the murderer from Cuenca, Morate\u201d. As explained in the article on 21 February of 2016, the El Mundo journalist published an interview with a young woman who had been the killer\u2019s partner, in which the reporter described in detail the house where the interview was held and revealed information regarding the ex-girlfriend\u2019s relationship with the killer, and even the killer\u2019s relationship with his victims. However, due to a court ruling on 10 November of 2019, the newspaper El Mundo was forced to publish an article saying that no such interview ever took place, nor was it true that the woman had been tortured or had known Morate\u2019s victims, nor that she had consented to the use of her photo from her Facebook profile, among other retractions.   111 In theory, when journalists write with this attitude, the interest does not seem to come from third parties, as the deception would not be intended to manipulate the audience into becoming socially or politically inclined in one direction or another, nor would it increase the profit of a certain media organization or company. Instead, the aim is personal benefit that is more or less immediate (sometimes as simple as continuing to meet expectations they feel they have created).   4.2. M for manipulate We start by differentiating between deception and manipulation. Deception occurs in a fictional story; Manipulation is revealed in a factual story. In other words, the manipulator takes the truth (the data or statements of the news) and creates a story that distorts the facts in order to achieve some previously planned objective.  The Royal Academy of Spanish (2019) specifies that manipulation serves particular interests: \u201cIntervention with skilful and sometimes devious means in politics, the market, information, etc., by distorting the truth or justice, at the service of specific interests\u201d. Therefore, the manipulation of information would consist of intervening with skilful and sometimes cunning means in the collection and transmission of news.  According to the definition, the journalist who intends to manipulate the reader distorts the truth by various means: hiding and twisting the information collected from sources, giving a biased version of the facts, and exaggerating certain data while minimizing or ignoring others. Moreover, they do so in order to serve particular interests, either their own or those of third parties.  In the context of fake news, an interest in manipulation can result in the following: 1. A change in the behaviour, attitude, or way of thinking of the audience, 2. Economic interest or gain (e.g., clickbait), and 3. Political interests (e.g. propaganda). The news that results from this type of disinformation is manipulated or biased.  A paradigmatic case of viralized information resulting from clickbait can be found in Mediterr\u00e1neo Digital with the headline, \u201cWhy are feminists uglier than average women\u201d? The article crossed all the red lines of political correctness and caused a chain reaction in the totality of public opinion. It was criticized by politicians, journalists, advertisers\u2019 boycotts, and even intimidation protesters. The information was duplicated in the press as well as on radio and television, and the news was reproduced by more than 200 media outlets around the world. The director in charge of the publication stated that they were given a global marketing campaign of incalculable value (Navascu\u00e9s, 2019). The novelty is not in the sensationalistic nature of the headline, but in the speed with which this content went viral on all types of channels (Llaneras and P\u00e9rez, 2017; Navascu\u00e9s, 2019).  However, returning to the mainstream press, recent history offers one of the most complex cases of disinformation: coverage of the terrorist attack on the Atocha train station. An article published in El Pa\u00eds in 2014 (Fernandez, 2014) reviewed the lies of the media ten years after the incident, which included a labyrinth of false data and manipulation at the service of spurious interests.  Even though the article offers a comprehensive view of the mass deception, one small detail can serve as an example of the variety of resources for falsification that a manipulative process of this magnitude can have: El Mundo linked part of a sticker found in a van to the Mondragon Business Group of the Basque Country in order to suggest that ETA was responsible for the attack (\u201cThe 11 March [11-M] Kangoo van used in the attack had a Mondragon Group card on the dashboard\u201d, 2006). However, in reality, the sticker was from a tape of the Mondragon Orchestra (\u201cThe police found a tape recording of the Mondragon Orchestra on 11 March in the Renault Kangoo,\u201d El Pais, 2006)  Reports of the attack contained biased news in which some media allied themselves with certain political sectors and catered to their interests. This perfectly illustrates the political disinformation described by Kalsnes (2018), which is used to influence the public\u2019s perception of an issue. This case violates all ethical principles of journalism, even beyond what had been observed a year and a half earlier in the treatment of the Prestige disaster, where government sources were the ones most responsible for the disinformation reflected in the media (Blanco, 2017).  Less complex reporting of the news can also be influenced by a dubious attitude. Here we offer a case for review that is simpler than those previously mentioned (the case did not involve a set of texts but rather a single text), and much more recent. It was a report published on Sunday, 20 October of 2019 in the Cr\u00f3nica  112 supplement of the newspaper El Mundo, with the headline, \u201cThe Civil Guard of October 1 (1-O) will take Franco out of the Valley by helicopter\u201d. The inaccuracy of the data contained in the article was denounced by the person affected in a letter to the editor of the newspaper: \u201cIn relation to the article published on 20 October in its print edition... referring to me, I would like to make the following clarifications: Most of the information referring to me is not true...\u201d (P\u00e9rez de los Cobos, 2019). The interested party then denied some of the information contained in the report, ranging from false information to the mention of a non-existent captain, according to his testimony.  In his letter, Diego P\u00e9rez de los Cobos denied being born in Yecla in 1964, rebuked that his father was a Falangist, and negated that his grandfather was killed by the Popular Front. He also denied having intervened in the liberation of Ortega Lara, and therefore having boasted about it or having been sent to Ecuador as an alleged prize for that intervention. Moreover, he even denied the existence of one of the sources mentioned (a captain from San Lorenzo de El Escorial), in addition to an error in the report that mentioned 2019 as the year in which the colonel assumed the command of the Civil Guard in Madrid, when he actually did so in 2018.  Other statements contained in the Cr\u00f3nica publication were corrected by the person alluded to above, and in the best of cases, they could best be understood as differences in the interpretation of the data, or if one prefers, as the journalist\u2019s interpretation of the data rather than a literal reflection of reality. For example, when the writer points out that P\u00e9rez de los Cobos was sent by the Rajoy government to prevent the October 1 referendum, omitting an initial indication that the order came from the Attorney General of Catalonia, or when the writer concludes that the Supreme Court did not take into account the testimony of P\u00e9rez de los Cobos when the court decided that what had happened in Catalonia was a crime of sedition, and not one of rebellion. On the one hand, if a comparison is made between the journalistic text, the letter to the editor, and other publications that reported the events that occurred on different dates, and on the other hand, if the article\u2019s discourse is analysed, this leads to the next question: What is the intention of a journalist who combines a series of erroneous statements in his article that are difficult to explain through carelessness or to justify through haste, especially when the portrait of the colonel referred to in the headline is painted in a derogatory light?  This vision is forged by means of rhetorical procedures of an argumentative nature through the use of certain so-called distorted figures, recourse to the meticulous detail of scenes that the journalist reconstructs with no mention of information sources, evocation of facts and actions carried out by the protagonist of the report whose balance is always negative, assessments brought to the pages of the newspaper by the speeches of others who are always anonymous, and even by the journalists themselves.  It is precisely the sources cited in the journalistic text itself that are elements that might question its credibility. Of the ten sources cited, only two have been identified completely, which is the lawyer for the Franco family and Colonel P\u00e9rez de los Cobos himself, not as a direct source of the report but as an indirect source (words taken from his appearance before the Supreme Court). According to the letter written by P\u00e9rez de los Cobos, the partially identified source is a person who never existed, simply a fabricated source, whom the text states is the person who provided the information about the express order of the colonel, the content of which supposedly appears in quotation marks. A fourth source is more specifically identified, yet equally undefined: a Professor of Constitutional Law at Complutense University of Madrid. For the rest, the journalist uses expressions such as the following: people who knew him, those who know him, those who have worked with him, his critics, and so on. The journalist uses professional confidentiality to explain these vague references.  It may be difficult ascertain in detail what the journalist was trying to achieve with a clearly interpretative profile interspersed with false data, supported for the most part by anonymous sources and embellished with resources that may have inclined the reader toward a particular opinion, but the combination of all these elements inevitably leads to disinformation, and it would even be difficult for this story to be included in the following section.  4.3. I for Inform The third attitude is the one that must preside over any journalistic coverage: Inform. The same definition found in DRAE (2019), which is \u201cto notify or give news of something\u201d, includes the other key term: News. According to the same dictionary, news is \u201cinformation about something considered of interest in  113 disclosing\u201d. The second meaning that appears is \u201creported facts\u201d. Futhermore, we must not forget that this implies the veracity of what has been disclosed. In and of itself, a fact is something that has happened; therefore, it is something real, not invented.  When a journalist intends to inform, one expects to find news without qualifiers, because the following should be qualities inherent to the concept of news: true news, rigorous news, and quality news. Even when the journalist tries to inform, the result can be false, erroneous or mistaken news, or in other words, news that contains misprints, errors in the transmission of certain data, flaws in evaluating the relevance of the data collected, and errors resulting from the so-called \u201ccompositional bias\u201d (Mezo, 2017).  Of course, it is possible to find false or falsified news here as well, even the most extreme, but this is not a result of the journalist\u2019s own actions, such as those in the two preceding sections. In the worst-case scenario, the journalist is a victim of his or her sources. The source is the one who deceives or manipulates the journalist, using his or her own authority as the source, or their prestige in spreading false information. Apart from this supposition, sometimes adulterated or falsified news is a consequence of a work situation, precariousness, urgency in transmission, ignorance, or inexperience.  In this category, we must also include rumour, which is repudiated by deontological codes and stylebooks, even when the passage of time makes it an obvious truth. However, it cannot be inferred from its disclosure that the journalist intends to deceive or manipulate the audience. Moreover, once a rumour is spread, there is often nothing more than a reprehensible rush to get ahead of the rest, or an interest in being the first to break the news.  Setting a malicious rumour in motion is usually the result of interested sources and an indication of what was noted two paragraphs above, or in other words, that the intention to deceive would not proceed from the journalist, but from his or her source. This can be illustrated by a situation that occurred in 2008 when a Moroccan newspaper seemed to be suggesting that Spanish politician Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar was the father of the child being carried by Rachida Dati, who was a French minister at the time. Aznar himself denied this in a statement issued by the Foundation for Social Studies and Analysis (FAES). Everything points to the newspaper having spread the rumour, and in fact, it did not explicitly mention the name of the alleged father, but it provided data that pointed unequivocally to the former president of Spain.  At this point, we can agree that fabricated news is fake news, but not all fake news is fabricated news in the strict sense of someone having consciously created something false. Thus, it follows that fake news is a consequence of fabrication, or the result of a conscious or unconscious alteration of the truth. Alternatively, in the words of St. Augustine in his Tratados sobre la mentira (Treatise on Lies), \u201cNot everyone who makes false statements is lying if they believe, or are of the opinion, that what they are saying is true\u201d, from which it follows that lying implies an intent to falsify the truth.  When the aim of the issuer is to inform, yet content is used that does not conform to reality, one could speak of journalistic malpractice, which culminates in a false story, but in most cases without the intention of deceiving or manipulating. Journalists transmit fake news for several reasons: the source has lied; the journalist did not understand the story or the source; he or she ignored some of the facts or erred in its selection (giving weight to what is unimportant, or less important, from a journalistic point of view); or the journalist made mistakes in the transmission.  All of this can lead to three different types of fake news: 1. News invented by the source, 2. News falsified by the source, and 3. Erroneous news due to a lack of professional rigour. In all three cases, it can be said that the journalist does not intend to deceive or manipulate. He or she intends to inform, but this objective is not achieved because the sources have intentionally mislead or manipulated the information, or there has been unintentional mishandling by the journalist. We have illustrated each type of fake news with specific cases below. 1. News invented by the source: On 11 September 2019, El Pa\u00eds published news of the trial against Eliseo Gil, an archaeologist accused of falsifying remains found at the Iru\u00f1a Veleia site. In 2006, Mr. Gil announced the discovery of remains that would change the history of linguistics and Christianity, supposedly a discovery of worldwide significance (Gorospe, 2019). A report by a commission of experts uncovered the fraud, which resulted in a scandal: on 20 November 2008, the headline of the newspaper El Diario Vasco read, \u201cIru\u00f1a Veleia scandal erupts due to false findings\u201d (Carrero, 2008). This case clearly illustrates the type of fake news invented by the source, whose prestige as an expert and authority as the person in charge of the site explains why the journalist did not question the veracity of the information.  114 2. News falsified by the source: In 2013, El Pa\u00eds published a photo, allegedly of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in an operating room, which was removed within half an hour from the digital edition, but the news was inevitably spread through its print edition (\u201cThe photo that El Pa\u00eds should never have published\u201d, 2013). In 2016, the newspaper La Raz\u00f3n published a photo of a Canadian journalist who was allegedly a suspected terrorist in the Paris attacks, a mistake that was also repeated by the Antena 3 television network. The BBC denounced the story, and the newspaper P\u00fablico reproduced the following: \u201cBBC journalist calls La Raz\u00f3n \u2018stupid\u2019 for publishing a fake photo of a suspected terrorist\u201d (2015). Both of these are good examples of news that is falsified by the source and then disseminated by a newspaper without taking the appropriate measures of verification.  3. Erroneous news due to a lack of professional rigour: The lack of professional rigour was more evident in the case of the fake news about the alleged interest on the part of the Moroccan government to profit from ticket sales of the Alhambra, which was echoed on 10 August 2011 by the newspaper ABC de Sevilla, as well as other media: \u201cMorocco asks Spain for half of the revenues of the Alhambra\u201d (2011). The next day, the newspaper El Diario de Sevilla (Vallejo, 2011), explained what had happened with the following headline: \u201cFalse news about the Alhambra opens an emotional conflict with Morocco\u201d. Below we have reproduced the first paragraph of this news item, as it summarises the events very well:  \u201cMorocco to demand half the profits of the Alhambra\u201d. This surprising headline made international news yesterday for a few hours, enough time to revolutionise the media as well as the Spanish and Moroccan authorities in view of the impact this possible heritage claim would generate. Finally, it was discovered that it was all a lie, and it was purely \u201cmanipulation\u201d and \u201cinvention\u201d in which the social networks, internet, news media and websites of the two countries were involved.  Even though the origin of this false information was apparently Alerta digital, which had launched a news item allegedly published by a Moroccan newspaper (this was later verified), the various media that echoed the news story without checking the information committed malpractice in which at least one, and probably more of the ethical principles of the profession was violated (not verifying the version of the source of information that may result in serious consequences, letting prejudice allow for the acceptance of false facts, and falling into the trap of confusing likelihood with truth). The invention of the news story by the first media that spread it illustrates the intention to deceive, and probably to manipulate by seeking a certain public perception of the illegitimate claim of a foreign country, while the behaviour of the other media that echoed the story demonstrates a lack of rigour in the treatment of the news story.  5. Discussion One of the main consequences of the phenomenon of fake news is that citizens are beginning to distrust honest news. What is at stake is nothing less than the stability of the democratic system, which is based on the existence of a free citizenry capable of making political decisions on the basis of truthful information.  Thus, if the media loses its credibility, public trust in these institutions will be weakened. Citizens do not always find it easy to distinguish the channel through which they receive news items. This informational cacophony is exploited by pseudo-journalistic media to their advantage in setting up their businesses, while at the same time it undermines the prestige and credibility of the entire profession. However, as we have seen, even the allegedly rigorous press sometimes inflicts this type of villainy on the health of the democratic system. Fictitious stories published as news, information built on biases and slanted interpretations of reality, false information disseminated without verification of accuracy, and a series of other misadventures described above have all resulted in corruption of the public arena by certain journalists who have issued information that should never have reached the public.  Nevertheless, such damage becomes blurred if its origin is uncertain. The DMI paradigm allows this to be clarified by categorising fake news produced in professional journalistic settings according to a variable located at the origin: the intention of the issuer. From such intentions, three types of news are produced: firstly, invented or fabricated news, which are fictitious stories resulting from the deception of a journalist; secondly, manipulated or biased news, which are factual accounts that have been corrupted by the slanted, biased intentions of the editor; and thirdly, erroneous or inaccurate news, in which the journalist had the intention of giving an honest report but was the victim of deception by the source, or malpractice, or the misinterpretation of reality. In all three cases, truth was the first victim of the information process, but as one can see, this happened for very different reasons.  115 On the other hand, this study asserts that technological advances are not the only factors capable of causing a proliferation of something that has always existed as an undesirable phenomenon: fake news. This is even truer if we consider the various degrees of falsification that can affect a news item, as falsehood can undoubtedly range from the most innocent mistake in a single piece of information to the deliberate invention of an entire story. The latter come to light because they are news items that are striking and massive. It is that simple. The former are much more difficult to detect, yet they have proliferated in recent times as well, possibly due to the fact that even when they confirm the veracity of news, novice journalists often write without understanding what they are writing about, as stated by I\u00f1aki Gabilondo (2011) in his book entitled, El fin de una \u00e9poca (The End of an Era). However, the evidence of fake news in the press is so scarce that it allows for verification of the initial hypothesis, despite the circumstances that might mask it and prevent its discovery. It is precisely this difficulty of detection that largely determines only partial verification of the second hypothesis: although it can be concluded with relative ease that a false news item, once discovered, leads to a deceptive attitude, the same does not apply to news items that contain errors or false data mixed with true data when deducing whether they are the result of a manipulative attitude or simply a lack of news rigour, because the textual resources used in either case could be exactly the same. In a certain way, verification of the third hypothesis explains the futility of fully complying with the second, as it has been proven that the detection of false news and false data in professional journalistic settings is more complex because of the inexistence of simple mechanisms to verify the accuracy of the news. Moreover, as falsification is more subtle and generally affects only partial aspects of the information, cases of disinformation pass through this stage unnoticed until some of those involved in the communicative process report them. This would reinforce the idea that we cannot take action against professional discredit only a posteriori. Instead, our actions should be directed toward prevention by maximizing precision and rigour in media coverage.  6. Conclusions The DMI paradigm makes it possible to delimit the responsibility of journalists in disinformation, which could contribute to preventing disinformation phenomena in routine professional activity. Based on a review of the intellectual attitudes of the transmitter at the time of message creation and of the cases derived from such attitudes, it is necessary to expand the very concept of disinformation. It is not only intentional disinformation that caters to interests outside the legitimate interests of a media outlet, but also unconscious disinformation resulting from the loss of precision and rigour in the professional performance of journalism that would distance the profession from serving the public interest.  Of the various types of false news, the most complex and difficult cases to uncover are those arising from harmful collusion between source and journalist. The non-existence of identifiable sources and the lack of verification that covers up the diffusion of erroneous data demonstrates certain negligence in the search for information and its validation before publication. With regard to redefinition of the journalist\u2019s role and his or her responsibility in disinformation, what has emerged from the analysis of newspapers has allowed us to once again highlight the need to have journalists in the post-truth era, because the presence of false or falsified news in this environment is much lower than in the digital environments, where non-journalistic sources have direct access without the filter of the communication professional. On the other hand, if it is more difficult for newspapers to create and disseminate false news, it is also more difficult to detect it when it occurs.  The procedures, or simply the signs of disinformation and falsehood, are not exclusive to a particular intention. They do not have a distribution of use according to the intent to deceive or manipulate through the news, but instead, the repertoire of actions is shared even by falsified news that had the intention of informing. In other words, an unbalanced headline or a biased composition may have been aimed at intentional disinformation, but it could be the result of an error (due to haste or ignorance) of a journalist who only intended to inform. Only by safeguarding the intention to inform can an explicit retraction by the media or journalist be understood when an error has been made, as expressly required by style guides. In order to stop the loss of quality and credibility this entails, verification initiatives inside and outside the media must be encouraged, but the training of journalists must also be reviewed (from technological knowledge to language skills), as well as professional practice, in order to maintain a self-critical and transparent attitude toward methods of obtaining data. Moreover, procedures that may contribute to disinformation must be banished from journalistic texts, as neither haste nor professional secrecy, nor the  116 understandable limitations that a journalist may have, can free him or her from suffering the discredit that has affected the profession in recent years. Many of the cases of disinformation detected by verification and fact-checking platforms such as Maldita.es and Newtral have come from users who were suspicious about information they had received through social networks or instant messaging services like WhatsApp. In this way, users might play a role similar to that of people who read the traditional press and send messages to the Letters to the Editor section. One of the cases explained in this article supports the parallelism and appropriateness of considering the \u2018Letters\u2019 section to be the basis for searching for journalistic texts in the future with errors that would be brought to light by readers.  Likewise, attention should also be paid to the traditional media in order to avoid the re-dissemination of false data by this sector. This aspect once again takes on much greater importance in online media, but it also needs to be addressed offline in order to stop the decline of journalism. The disinformation produced by a false, biased or inaccurate news item is multiplied if the errors it contains feed indiscriminately into new texts, a situation that is happening right now. When the responsibility that journalists have in the spread of disinformation has been established, and when their loss of credibility has been regained, it will then be necessary to investigate what is occurring within the media, and what role media companies play in generating disinformation, as well as in confronting it. In other words, it will be necessary to discover the way in which the quality of published news is being diminished by job insecurity, a lack of correction and editing tasks, as well as business interests, and the degree to which this is taking place.  7.

Chile. paulina.gomez@uc.cl \tEmotions and discourses in public controversies Emociones y discursos en las controversias p\u00fablicas \t\tThe emergence of the \u201cAffective Turn\u201d in Social Sciences (Arfuch, 2016) has allowed academia to revisit the Arendtian approach to constructing public issues and common affairs, by incorporating the question of emotions and affections into the configuration of public life. Research into the role of socio-affective experiences in shaping the common world has advanced in parallel with a growing interest in hypotheses relating to the processes of deep mediatisation that define today\u2019s societies (Hjarvard, 2017). This approach refers to a constitutive interdependence, in which media activities merge with those of socio-political, economic, cultural or religious institutions, producing far-reaching structural transformations at the macro level. This mediatisation process operates according to specific media logics, which also entail an affective dimension. This special issue explores the point at which both perspectives converge; that is, socio-affective experiences in the context of mediatisation. To do so, it aims for a more comprehensive, interdisciplinary reflection of communicative phenomena in the public sphere. It also follows in the footsteps of Martin Barbero: shifting away from a media-centric perspective towards one that fosters dialogue across a diverse range of disciplinary and methodological perspectives.  Contributors were called upon to exchange viewpoints on forms of emotional expression in the public sphere and, in particular, to explore their relationship with exercises of power, the bearing they have on shaping common affairs, and on the different stances and actors involved in controversies; to delve into the affective assemblages that block a particular issue or bring it into the limelight; to examine how audiences, together with political and cultural communities, are constructed; to observe the feelings and emotional impulses that give rise to forms of participation and communicative practices across mediatised platforms, including traditional and social media. To look, in short, at the various degrees of affective intensity triggered within public arenas to identify, engage and mobilise democratic audiences in constructing a common world.  The six articles that comprise this special edition deal with the imaginaries and socio-affective aspects of media discourse. They also reflect on the frameworks of meaning (and feeling) conveyed by the media, drawing on a content study that defines objects, subjects, positions and strategies in public controversies.  The issue opens with \u201cToxic emotions in the new public sphere: media controversies and hate speech,\u201d an article by Rafael Alc\u00e1cer-Guirao and H\u00e9ctor Fouce, which explains how public discourse provides a space for mediation between emotions and action. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, they present the case for a diverse public sphere, in which the destructive potential of hate speeches is lessened, not by repressive measures or exclusive safe spaces, but via the media, by guaranteeing spaces for democratic mediation. These serve as a participatory model, facilitating conversation between communities and allowing for the safe expression of counter responses. In public controversies, not only is the media a public arena, but it also plays an active role in delineating affective communities. Zaira Garc\u00eda-calahorra and Cristina Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn adopt this perspective in their \n 122 analysis of \u201cAudience emotions in journalistic texts during the Catalan-Spanish confrontation\u201d. They look at how the newspapers, El Pa\u00eds and Ara, give a moral and affective assessment of the situation, the opposition and its allies, mobilising complex affective assemblages that draw on both negative emotions (anger, fear, contempt) and positive emotions (enthusiasm, satisfaction, pride). These are presented in the article as the basic components of affective communities shared with their target audiences.  Marta Castillo-Gonz\u00e1lez goes on to explore how media representation of affective dispositions among young people is in the service of a \u201ccool precariousness\u201d. In \u201cThe discursive trendisation of youthful precariousness in the Spanish digital press\u201d, Castillo traces the way in which hegemonic media discourse portrays this youthful precariousness in a positive light, recasting it as a fashion experience (coliving, nesting, freeganism, etc.). In this regard, it assumes a performative aspect, transcending negative emotions associated with poverty, such as guilt and shame. Josep Pedro and Bego\u00f1a Guti\u00e9rrez-Mart\u00ednez examine a way of life for a community of Afro-descendants in Spain, whose relations and ties to one another stem from a series of political and cultural arrangements combined with affective dynamics. \u201cWomen artists in the Spanish scene of African American music: identities, speeches, and emotions in the public sphere\u201d adopts an ethnographic approach to the study of musical interpretation, its spaces, practices, and performers. It is a kind of public sphere that, not only welcomes diversity, but also accentuates what is common in terms of shared roles, sensitivities, and purpose.  The issue closes with two articles exploring the social network Twitter as one of the best venues for recording contemporary public disputes. In the \u201cSentiment Analysis of Twitter\u2019s agenda-setting regarding Spanish political parties during the 2018 Motion of Censure. A Compositional Data Approach\u201d, Marc Blasco-Duatis and Germ\u00e0 Coenders move beyond traditional research in this area to include sentiment analysis in their proposal. By applying compositional data analysis (CoDa) to political agenda-setting on Twitter, alongside sentiment analysis, they demonstrate the feasibility of a method that constitutes \u201cthe first proven experience of a CoDa study of two compositions in the field of political communication\u201d. Also taking a methodological approach, in \u201c#Impeachment of Donald Trump: Emotions and Speeches in the Virtual Twitter Communities\u201d, Karines Rodr\u00edguez-D\u00edaz and Yamile Haber-Guerra propose using multimodal discourse and data mining to explore feelings in virtual communities. In their essay, they emphasise the usefulness of techniques for processing a relevant corpus and analysing materials with varied content. To close, we would like to thank Victoria Tur-Vi\u00f1es, Carmen Marta-Lazo and Jes\u00fas Segarra-Saavedra for their generous support in putting together this special issue, as well as the Spanish Association of Communication Research (AEIC) for all their work on the subject.

To discuss this concept, an interdisciplinary approach linking the legal principles of freedom of expression with the centrality of public sphere deliberation in democratic societies is offered, with a review of how the discourse establishes a mediation space between emotion and action. We argue that a diverse public sphere where offensive discourses are allowed needs media mediation. The role of the media would concentrate on reconfiguration of their position within the public sphere offering participatory models and recovering their position as communities\u2019 places of encounters and conversation.   El castigo penal a los discursos de odio se ha generalizado en Espa\u00f1a en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os: uno de los argumentos para negarle la protecci\u00f3n reforzada de la libertad de expresi\u00f3n es que, por su car\u00e1cter irracional, no merece la calificaci\u00f3n de discurso. Para discutir esta idea, ofrecemos una aproximaci\u00f3n interdisciplinaria que conecta los principios jur\u00eddicos de la libertad de expresi\u00f3n con la centralidad de la deliberaci\u00f3n en la esfera p\u00fablica en las sociedades democr\u00e1ticas a trav\u00e9s de una revisi\u00f3n de c\u00f3mo el discurso ofrece un espacio de mediaci\u00f3n entre las emociones y la acci\u00f3n. Defendemos que una esfera p\u00fablica diversa en la que se permitan incluso los discursos ofensivos necesita de la mediaci\u00f3n de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n en tanto estos sean capaces de reconfigurar su lugar en la esfera p\u00fablica ofreciendo modelos participativos y recuperen su lugar como espacios de encuentro y conversaci\u00f3n de las comunidades.

Introduction: emotions in court On 17 February 2020, Spanish actor Willy Toledo sat before Madrid\u2019s 26th Criminal Court, accused of offending religious sentiments by insulting God and the Virgin Mary in comments he posted on Facebook back in 2017. It was \u201ca comment that directly attacked Christians by making a mockery of their dogmas\u201d, according to the Spanish Association of Christian Lawyers, which filed the court case against Toledo. This association also filed court cases again several women who participated in \u201cthe Insubordinate Pussy\u201d procession through the streets of Seville, on 1 May 2014. Toledo\u2019s message criticised a Sevillian judge\u2019s decision to initiate an oral trial against these women for offending religious sentiments and hate crimes. Evidently, some Catholics were offended enough by such expressive acts as to bring the case to court, invoking a Criminal Code that protects the feelings of the members of a religious confession (article 525 CP) and other emotional states linked to patriotic symbols such as emblems and flags (article 543), and accordingly sets out monetary fines for those who publicly disparage religious dogmas, beliefs or ceremonies. Shifting the ideological spectrum, another sector of the Spanish population was also offended by the actions of Hazte O\u00edr (\u201cMake yourself Heard\u201d), an organisation that toured various cities on a charted bus that displayed the message \u201cBoys have penises, girls have vaginas\u201d. The bus tour was cautiously cancelled in several capital cities after being the subject of various complaints that invoked the feelings and rights of LGTBI people.  In recent years, Spaniards have witnessed a trend to restrict public expression. As part of what may end up shifting the socio-political model of the country, public deliberation seems to cease to be understood as prius of democracy to become merely a focus of conflict and disagreement. Instead taking an active role in public matters, citizens of the so called \u201csnowflake generation\u201d (Fox, 2016: 57 and subsequent pages) increasingly act as victims of speech, as vulnerable and hypersensitive patients who need speech-free spaces where they can feel safe, and demand governmental protection against those who think different. Meanwhile, the government, which is always reactive to the headlines and open to short-term initiatives, is welcoming these demands for protection and acting as if there is only one solution: interpreting all critical, dissident or offensive speeches as threats that must be silenced. In this crusade, consensus is total and independent of political affiliations. Just like demagoguery, the left promises to abolish gag laws and legislation protecting religious sentiment, but also agrees to make the exaltation of Francoism a crime. On the other hand, the right, outraged by this eternal return to the past and now flying the flag of freedom of expression, seems to forget that when it had the opportunity it increased exponentially the penalties for free-expression-related crimes in the 2015 reform to the Spanish Criminal Code.  This phenomenon is multifaceted and very complex. However, some of its causes can be identified. The first one is the axiological relevance assigned to subjective emotions and feelings, and the consequent attribution of an unlawful nature to offensive or distasteful words and acts. In this climate of conformity and political correctness, subjective feelings are treated as personal interests and turned into purported rights, so that any offense to such feelings is axiologically equated to harm to an individual\u2019s personal dignity and honour. This gives way to a new \u201cright\u201d: the right to not be offended. In doing so, the traditional liberal conception of free expression \u2013whose only limit should be not to cause harm to others, according to Stuart Mill\u2019s classic dictum\u2013 is cut at its base: the right to offend, as a necessary condition for ensuring intense and uninhibited debate on public affairs, is transformed into the duty to not offend, which in turn becomes the obligation to moderate the form and substance of speech.  What is perhaps more worrying, because it really shows that this change of model has come to stay, is that the censorship of offensive expression is not only imposed by public authorities, but is also demanded and exercised by citizens, who are increasingly sensitive and less tolerant of irreverence, satire and lewd criticism. As Mick Hume (2016:33) points out, in this era of reverse Voltaires:  people are perceived and often perceive themselves as vulnerable, capable of being harmed or being incited to harm others only by virtue of words. Humanity\u2019s image as vulnerable, thin-skinned, and ultra-sensitive makes freedom of expression appear a dangerous activity. This fallacious identification between feelings and rights is reflected very clearly in another one of the causes that explains the decline of free speech: the demands for the protection of cultural identities. The demands of some sectors of multiculturalism regarding differences and particularisms of certain cultural groups have also become a strong dyke to the fluidity of political speech, by considering any manifestation of rejection or contempt of the traits, traditions and symbols that make up and unite the identity of a group as harmful to the dignity of its members. These \u201cidentity policies\u201d (Taylor, 2003) demand significant restrictions on freedom of expression because, from the perspective of identity groups, any offense to the traditions,  125 symbols and traits that shape the identity of the group will be understood as an attack on the dignity of the members of the group, just like any criticism of those traditions will be described as hate, racist or discriminatory speech, which is strongly punished by the Spanish Criminal Code (art. 510 CP). The third cause of the current trend to restrict free speech plays an essential role in the exponential increase in the suppression of satirical speech on the grounds of its exaltation of terrorism or humiliation of victims of terrorist crimes (art. 578 CP), which has led to an unusual escalation in the condemnation of rappers, Twitter users and puppeteers. This third factor is precisely the exaltation of the victim as a reverential icon, against whom any critical or satirical speech acquires the status of blasphemy. The laudable care for victims of violent crime has, at the same time, created various socio-political perversions. On the one hand, victims have been placed as leading actors in decision-making regarding what and how much should be punished, with the consequent detriment of punitive rationality. On the other hand, the feelings and emotional demands of the victims have become one of the priority guides of action for public authorities, so that any speech that minimises or satirises their privileged social status will be considered worthy of reproach. The combination of the aforementioned factors \u2013the need to protect feelings, the rise of cultural identity as worthy of protection, and the quasi-sacred role of the victim- has produced an interesting phenomenon in which victims \u2013generic, abstract, unspecified\u2013 have become an identity-based social group, and consequently any shameful, contemptuous or even comic comment regarding a particular victim \u2013living or dead\u2013 becomes a harm to the dignity of all the victims (\u201cWe all are Carrero Blanco\u201d). Conversely, the members of minority social groups become perpetual victims, so that any hostile message to identity traits is equated with individual harm. This also has an important effect on the application of the Criminal Code: the perspective of the victim is based exclusively on the criterion of interpretation of the conduct, their hurt feelings \u2013anger and indignation\u2013 are quasi-irrefutable evidence of the harm of the words expressed and of the harmful purpose that guided the author of the message. As Claire Fox (2016:26) has stated, \u201cclaiming to be a victim gives people a perverse authority (...) Victim status can purchase special privileges and gives the green light to brand opposing views or even mild criticisms as tantamount to hate speech\u201d. Faced with the axiological cusp on which victims \u2013or the Victim as an archetypal category\u2013 have been placed, freedom of expression will always remain on the lighter side of the scale. The legal framework that has exuded from this new social scenario is the criminal punishment of hostile and offensive expression. As mentioned, the Spanish Criminal Code protects feelings and strongly sanctions the so-called \u201chate speech\u201d. This figure (art. 510 CP) criminalises the expression of certain ideas when they are directed against a group based on the common trait of its members, which could be their real or perceived race, nationality or ethnic origin, language, skin colour, religion, sex, age, intellectual or physical disability, sexual orientation and other similar factors.  Through this type of crimes, a set of emotions is introduced normatively into the public sphere, as a modulating factor for free speech and as the basis for the orientation of public deliberation. The intention to offend a group is punishable, but if this intent cannot be demonstrated (as in the case of the feminist parade in Seville), there is no crime to punish.  Based on the previous situation, this article questions the place of feelings of offense in public speech and explores how their centrality is one of the factors that is transforming the public sphere. Should everyone or just certain vulnerable minorities be protected from encountering offensive ideas? How does the quality of a democracy is affected by restrictions on the free expression of certain offensive ideas and their concurrence in the marketplace of ideas? To what extent has the structural transformation of the public sphere \u2013the erosion of the role of the media as gatekeepers and the emergence of social media\u2013 placed emotions linked to hate speech in such a central position that now state intervention via criminal sanctions is required?  2. The centrality of emotions in the new public sphere When Habermas (2002) defined the concept of public sphere, it influenced its rational and discursive nature. The public sphere was conceived as a rational deliberation space in which citizens discussed matters concerning the common government, arbitrated by the media. Journalism was conceived as a mechanism to show citizens the two possible sides of an issue in a distanced manner, they were able to choose the best option based on their sympathies and interests (Rosen, 1997: 193). Objectivity, identification of sources, and obligation to give voice to all parties involved in a conflict are the weapons that journalism uses to generate the space that enables that rational discussion.  126 This view of the public sphere presupposes the existence of a rational and ideal citizen, able to put their passions and affections aside to make decisions based not on selfishness but on the interest of the community (in the form of John Rawls\u2019 veil of ignorance or Apel\u2019s ideal speech situation). Along with this conception of the citizen, Habermas argues that the public sphere was based on \u201cunlikely\u201d cultural and social assumptions and a threatened cultural infrastructure, which depends mainly on: the existence of socially aware journalism, with important mass media and press organisations capable of directing the interest of the vast majority of citizens towards issues that are relevant to the formation of political opinion. And also on the existence of a reading population that is interested in politics, has a good education level, is accustomed to the conflicting process of public opinion formation, and takes time to read independent quality press (Habermas in Hermoso, 2018). Different authors have pointed out that the conception of citizen on which Habermas\u2019s definition of public sphere is based is exclusionary, particularly towards women and the popular classes (Fraser, 1993). Importantly, Habermas himself has recognised this problem and has also admitted that the conditions for the bourgeois public sphere no longer exist. The emergence of the Internet, first blogs and then social networks, has radically changed the dynamics of the public sphere. However, while digital media provide the conditions for a more open and participatory public deliberation (Jarvis, 2015; Dahlberg, 2007), the shift from the flow of mass information that characterised the media to the virality that characterises social networks (Rodr\u00edguez, 2013) has radically fragmented the public sphere: there is no longer a single public sphere but a set of separate spheres (Sampedro, 2000). In contrast to the idea of a public plaza where we can all participate, the digital world has generated a set of narrow spaces characterised by echo chambers and filter bubbles (Pariser, 2017; Sunstein 2003).  In addition to this closure around communities, the new diversified and fragmented public sphere is characterised by the centrality of emotions, discussing the rational nature of Habermas\u2019 conception, which is also shared by democratic republican theorists (see Sunstein, 1993). As Maiz (2010) points out, the \u201cfeat of reason\u201d was to exclude emotions from ordinary life and political experience. In fact, democracy and the state are conceived, by such authors as Hamilton (as cited in Maiz, 2010), as instruments to tame emotions. For Maiz, enlightened hyper-rationalism leads to overestimation of consensus and neglect of collective identities.  The shift from a deliberative and rationalist view of the public sphere to a more emotional dimension runs parallel to other shifts in political theory, which moves from liberalism and republicanism to communitarian democracy, whose views encourage new populisms. Faced with an estranged conception of political participation, communitarianism theorists defend the need for democracy to actively protect the most oppressed groups, even at the cost of restricting the right of others to express their views and emotions. Freedom of expression, which for many is a constituent element of democracy (Carey, 1997), has been reduced by the consideration that, in the new public sphere, there is a widespread of hate speech that undermines the possibilities of certain groups to participate normally in democracy (Taylor, 2003; Parekh, 2012).    3. Public deliberation, conflict and offense How should a democracy treat speech that openly argues that immigrant, gay or black, Catholic or pro-Franco people are despicable and deserve to be stripped off certain rights? This question is not rhetorical or restricted to certain political positions: just as the Christian lawyers filled a court case against Willy Toledo and the Insubordinate Pussy Procession, the newly appointed government has proposed a reform of the Criminal Code to penalise apology and exaltation of the Franco\u2019s dictatorship (Marcos, 2020) This situation makes us wonder about the limits of freedom of expression and the role it plays in the formation of a democratic society and the inherent aspiration to strike a balance between maximising this freedom for each of its members and ensuring equality of access to public spaces and resources for all individuals and social groups. This article is particularly interested on the role of sanctioning Law as an instance of mediation in the public sphere that determines whether certain ideas and their spokespersons can have a place in the deliberative forum. There are voices calling for restricting the access of hate speech to the public sphere and those who promote tolerance for intolerant people as a fundamental element in a deliberative democracy. And there are in fact laws that regulate this access. The analysis focuses on how this political and legal discussion is articulated with the communicative dynamics in which a society defines its public issues. As Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn points out (2017: 14), \u201cwhat the public sphere does, what it builds, is a connection, a mediation, between citizens, the world and its  127 representatives, which involves, among other actors, the media\u201d. It is this communicative space that enables the construction of public issues, which are \u201cnot given in nature\u201d but are present and relevant in the public scene thanks to the practical activities and interactions of the actors and the media that promote and develop them. In doing so, they constitute the public sphere (Gustfield, 2003: 74).  Public problems are spaces of conflict and controversy. They are configured as such because some of their aspects are presented by certain actors as contrary to public interest (which questions the status quo) and because they require institutions to treat them as objects of intervention and demand changes and solutions (Gusfield, 2003: 69). This demand is articulated in different areas of the public sphere that are visible in both traditional and social media. These spaces become public arenas guided by different dynamics and protagonists (Cefa\u00ef, 2002) and articulate controversies (Venturini, 2010) that have certain specificity in comparison to other types of discursive social conflicts. They occur in a context of shared uncertainty and with the expectation of a possible agreement towards which each party guides their aspirations.  Understanding the public sphere as a public communication space for common issues, where citizens can have some power, involves addressing the problems of interaction and translation between political actors and citizens, as well as the fact that citizens depend on this space to acquire knowledge, experience and memory of the world (Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn, 2017).  For a social issue to become a public problem, it is necessary to have a public that is not directly affected by the issue but still feels appealed by it because it is part of the same world and, thus, deserves its attention and participation. In Dewey\u2019s classic idea (2004: 75), the public consists \u201cof all those who are directly and seriously affected\u201d by common issues.  This idea is central to deliberative democracy: free public discussion is, above voting, the source of legitimacy of laws and institutions (Sunstein, 1993). Public deliberation involves ensuring the circulation of as much as possible information on ideological options, which necessarily implies the inclusion of offensive demonstrations. Even a speech that proposes to limit the rights of certain groups should have a place in the space of deliberation, since, no matter how much it can be rejected by a majority of citizens, intolerant speech is projected on matters that concern us all and puts forward a political proposal on certain social conflicts (Sunstein, 1993). Public deliberation must tolerate immoderation, irrationality, and even hatred and intolerance.  However, this broad conception of freedom of expression that is shared by liberalism and republicanism is rejected by other models of democracy, which deem community the central element of social life, in contrast to the centrality of the individual in liberal conceptions. This conception rejects the classic principle of the neutrality of the state, on the grounds that the blindness of the liberal state towards cultural particularities prevents the establishment of a policy aimed at rebalancing the disadvantages of minority groups and protecting minority cultures. For Taylor (1993), the politics of universal dignity fought for forms of non-discrimination that were blind to differences, while the politics of difference redefined non-discrimination as requiring that we make these distinctions the basis of differential treatment. Freedom of expression would then set the limit on the offense to minority groups and their feelings. Any hostile or discriminatory speech against cultural practices or traditions will be understood as an aggression to the very dignity of the group (Pinto, 2010), since symbols and beliefs are understood as extensions of personal reputation and dignity. For Kahan (1988), liberalism ignores the seriousness of the damage that hostile speech against a group entails for both the group and society as a whole.  Therein lies the damage inherent in hate speech, according to these voices critical of the liberal paradigm. For Parekh (2012), hate speech undermines the dignity of the group members by stigmatising them. By denying their ability to live as responsible members of society and ignoring their individuality, hate speech reduces these members to generic specimens of the group, dehumanises them, and symbolically excludes them from society as full citizens. In the face of this view, some voices claim that the essence of democracy is deliberation and, therefore, dissent, even when it is offensive to one of the parties. \u201cIf freedom means anything, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear (Orwell, as cited in Hume, 2016: 15). Offense culture is a barrier to the fluidity of public speech. According to Dworkin (1996), in democracy there is no right to suppress manifestations that may offend some people. In a social context characterised by closed communicative environments, such as social media, more and more voices claim that in order to recover public deliberation we need to assume that citizens must tolerate ideas they have not voluntarily chosen and which, eventually, may question their beliefs and even be offensive to them (Sunstein, 2003; Pariser, 2017).     128 4. The place of emotions in speech Paradoxically, while some try to reject the argument that hate speech has a true discursive character, there is a wide spreading demand to include emotions as part of the analysis of speech (some even talk about an affective shift in the social sciences, see Lara and Enciso, 2013) and public deliberation (Krause, 2008), moving away from an overly rationalistic dimension. To defend this position, it is argued that public deliberation requires a certain degree of rationality and that hatred and intolerance are irrational per se, or that at least some ways of manifesting such intolerance, for the purposes of confrontation rather than persuasion, do not deserve to be considered rational speech (Vives Ant\u00f3n, 2015).  This point of view aims to undo the progress made so far in this area, as Austin pointed out in 1955, when he recalled that a first step in rethinking the nature of speech was to rethink the very nature of statement (of fact) and extend it beyond factual findings, to ask \u201cwhether many apparent pseudo-statements really set out to be \u2018statements\u2019 at all\u201d. It has been argued that \u201cmany utterances that look like statements are either not intended at all or only intended in part, to record or impart straightforward information about the facts. For example, \u2018ethical propositions\u2019 are perhaps intended, solely or partly, to evidence emotion or to prescribe conduct or to influence it in special ways\u201d (Austin, 1990: 43).  As Austin demonstrates, it is important to emphasise that speech has different dimensions depending on its relation to the extradiscursive context. Austin is a pioneer in the definition of the performative dimension of certain sentences or utterances: performative utterances and sentences are those in which \u201cto utter the sentence... is not to describe my doing of what I should be said in so uttering to be doing: it is to do it\u201d (1990: 46). Verbs such as swear, baptise, bet, and bequeath do not refer to something external to speech, but are actions in themselves.  Faced with these illocutionary acts, every speech has a perlocutionary dimension, what we bring about or achieve by saying something. In other words, it is established that the linguistic act has consequences in the real world in which it is expressed. This dimension of signs to transform the environment \u2013which is implicit in any discussion about freedom of expression and its dangers\u2013 had been already examined by Peirce: the sign, determined by its object, produces an interpretant, an \u201cequivalent or more developed\u201d sign, since it expresses the object under different aspects (Casta\u00f1ares, 2019: 142). However, it is often forgotten that, in addition to the logical interpretant, who allows an idea to develop through a process of unlimited semiosis, Peirce also contemplates the existence of an energetic interpretant, an effect of the sign that involves an effort (runners launching off the starting line in a race when hearing the gunshot). The existence of this energetic effect requires a \u201cfirstness\u201d; the first meaning of a sign is the feeling it produces (Peirce, CP 5.475). The mediation of the feeling is necessary for the sign to produce \u201cany further proper significant effect\u201d (ibid). In this sense, we are not too far from Damasio\u2019s position (as cited in Saiz Echezarreta, 2016: 115), who argues that agreements on social norms rest well on an affective bond: we act on what matters to us. For Peirce, action is an effect of belief. \u201cOur beliefs guide our desires and shape our actions\u201d (Peirce [1],1988: 14). \u201cThe feeling of believing is an indication of there being established in our nature some habit which will determine our actions\u201d (ibid.) It is certainly best for us that our beliefs should be such as may truly guide our actions so as to satisfy our desires: and this reflection will make us reject every belief which does not seem to have been so formed as to insure this result (Peirce, 1988: 18). Peirce considered that we maintain our beliefs because they generate a state of \u201ccalm and satisfaction\u201d while doubt causes \u201cirritation\u201d (Peirce,1988: 17), \u201cunease and dissatisfaction\u201d (Peirce,1988: 15): but it is precisely this discomfort that allows \u201cinquiry\u201d, an inferential process that allows us to reach the unknown from what we know (Peirce,1988: 8) and whose ultimate object is the establishment of opinion (Peirce,1988: 20). Peirce recognises that one of the ways of fixing belief is the method of tenacity, which equates to the ostrich\u2019s tactic of hiding its head in the face of danger (Peirce, 1988: 20). However, Pierce points out that the man who adopts this method at some point will be prone to think that the opinions of others are as quite as good as his own. This conception, that another man\u2019s thoughts or sentiments may be equivalent to one\u2019s own, is a distinctly new step and a highly important one.  Since we necessarily influence each other\u2019s opinions, the problem of fixing belief moves from the individual to the social dimension. At this point, Peirce unleashes his contempt for all those ways of fixing opinion through social pressure and not through inquiry into facts, in a brutal paragraph that anticipates much of the history of the West in the 20th century: Let the will of the state act, then, instead of that of the individual. Let an institution be created which shall have for its object to keep correct doctrines before the attention of the people, to reiterate  129 them perpetually, and teach them to the youth; having at the same time power to prevent contrary doctrines from being taught, advocated, or expressed... Let their passions be enlisted, so that they may regard private and unusual opinions with hatred ad horror. Then, let all men who reject the established belief be terrified into silence. Let people turn out and tar-and-feather such men... when complete agreement could not otherwise be reached, a general massacre of all who have not thought in a certain way has proved a very effective means of settling opinion in a country (Peirce,1988: 22). In the last part of the paragraph, Peirce describes a situation similar to the one addressed in this article: If the power to do this be wanting, let a list of opinions be drawn up, to which no man of the least independence of thought can assent, and let the faithful be required to accept all these propositions, in order to segregate them as radically as possible from the influence of the rest of the world. In the face of this state of control on the part of power, Peirce defends the need to be educated in the ability to draw inferences (Peirce,1988: 2) \u201cfor it is not so much a natural gift as a long and difficult art\u201d, since \u201cthat which determines us, from given premises, to draw one inference rather than another, is some habit of the mind\u201d (Peirce, 1988: 10). And now, once again, we witness a tendency to hold postulates that guarantee our comfort more than those postulates that are true and empirically verified and proven. Peirce\u2019s contempt for authority-based methods and his defence of discursive rationality allow us to analyse the semiotic qualities of hate speech and its connection to communicative, social, and legal practices. The Fixation of Belief presents a defence of the scientific method as a way of studying reality, but as Casta\u00f1ares (2019b: 224) points out, for Peirce, \u201clogic and semiotics largely coincide\u201d, generating \u201cthe expansion of logic from the realm of theory towards practice, from the realm of strict demonstration to that of argumentation. This expansion is justified on the grounds that the logical strength of reasoning is not theoretical but depends on the effects it produces on reality\u201d. It is necessary to remember here that, already since classical rhetoric, \u201cthe fundamental core of the argument is evidence\u201d (Casta\u00f1ares, 2019b: 219). It is through evidence that necessary or plausible conclusions are reached. According to Aristotle, \u201cthe thing whose existence or production carries in itself the existence of something else, whether before or after, is what is called evidence, for it indicates that something else has happened or exists\u201d (as cited in Casta\u00f1ares, 2019b: 221). For Peirce, \u201cno factual assertion can be made without resorting to indices\u201d (Casta\u00f1ares, 2019b: 237). And it is, as we have seen, through the habit generated by practice how we get to realise the inferences that establish the relationship between cause and effect that characterises the index. The defence of the inferential method is not only a defence of the scientific method but also of deliberation as a way of reaching a shared belief.  In short, Peirce flatly rejects the fixation of ideas through authority and makes a defence of rationality, which in our case is a defence of the argumentative model: belief is fixed at the social level through habits generated by shared efforts. He also recognises in his theory of signs that emotion is what originates semiosis and what drives action and, in a third step, when rationalised, is what produces laws and norms. To consider that hate speech does not exist because irrationality prevents it from attaining this status is to consider the other -the irrational, the dissenting, the offender- as a barbarian who does not deserve equal consideration and who must be expelled beyond borders, the way the Romans set limes that separated men from beasts, also ignoring the fact that it is precisely on the border (Lotman, 1996) where every universe of meaning (semiosphere) is confronted with its own limits and, in that reflective process, where the great moments of social creativity are generated To deny hate speech its discursive nature is to adopt the ostrich\u2019s tactic. To wait for the authorities to remove it, from our social environment, via the law, is to appeal to oppression and control, to deny the reality of the ideological and cultural conflict inherent in the diversity of our societies. According to the American Supreme Court, this inherent complexity of modernity requires a \u201cbroad, robust and uninhibited\u201d debate (New York Times vs. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 [1964]) and therefore public deliberation must tolerate considerable doses \u201cnot only of immoderation but even of irrationality in speech\u201d (Alc\u00e1cer, in press: 193). As we have seen, emotions are at the basis of signifying practices. The fact that the most elaborate phase of this process occurs with the application of rationalisation processes through abstract laws and principles does not imply that the emotional elements that are at the origin of the semiosis chain are maintained in the speech. Hate can be irrational, but it is still speech (Alc\u00e1cer, in press: 193). Therefore, from a communicative point of view, the question is how feelings relate to the rational propositions of speech, and how is it possible to connect emotions, actions, and rationalisation processes in public deliberation.   130 For Krause (as cited in Saiz Echezarreta, 2016: 115), attention to the feelings of others improves the processes of democratic deliberation. The presence of others, anticipating their reaction and responsiveness, was considered in Bakhtin\u2019s dialogical conception of language, which promotes dialogue as the model of any communicative process. The word in the living conversation is directly, blatantly, oriented toward a future answer-word: it provokes an answer, anticipates it and structures itself in the answer\u2019s direction. Forming itself in an atmosphere of the already spoken, the word is at the same time determined by that which has not yet been said but which is needed and in fact anticipated by the answering word. Such is the situation in any living dialogue (Bakhtin, 1989: 97). This incorporation of hypotheses on the receiver is not only a mechanism that improves communication, but also has an ethical principle. The supremacy of the answer in the Bakhtinian model \u201ccreates a fertile ground for understanding, makes it active and interesting\u201d (Bakhtin, 1989: 97). Dialogue presupposes the existence of a common space, an expectation of understanding: \u201cthe speaker breaks through the alien horizon of the listener, constructs his own utterance on alien territory\u201d (Bakhtin, 1989: 99).  However, that shared horizon can also be a terrain of conflict. The use of the alien word, a matter that interested Bakhtin, is modulated according to the identification or distance effect that the speaker wants to produce. Often, the use of the alien word, its categories, topics of interest, accents, or idioms \u201cis clearly opportunistic and other times is provocatively controversial\u201d (Bakhtin, 1989: 99100). We build our speech on alien territory to refract our points of view, so that this language is unmasked and destroyed as false, hypocritical, biased, limited, and unsuitable to reality (Bakhtin, 1989: 129). In short, the incorporation of the other into our speech does not necessarily take place in constructive terms but is also a mechanism of criticism and divergence. While dialogue may seek understanding, it also leaves room for offense and contempt. The rationality of expression is not at odds with the emotionality of ideas: the balance between the two elements is precisely the necessary habit that is built in public deliberation. Accepting offense and repelling it in expressive terms is part of the skills needed to live in a complex, cosmopolitan democratic society and to interact in a polyphonic and diverse public sphere.  Mismanagement of the balance between emotions and facts seriously damages the quality of public debate. In their analysis of threats to freedom of expression on American universities, Lukianoff and Haidt (2015) point out that \u201cby almost any definition, critical thinking requires grounding one\u2019s beliefs in evidence rather than emotion or desire\u201d. However, for a generation raised in safe environments and with a speech that depicts the outside world as a threat (the snowflake generation), the one that now occupies university campuses, any challenge to the status quo is perceived as a disruptive threat. This fear of facing a conflicted outside world incites emotional reasoning, which assumes \u201cthat your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: I feel it, therefore it must be true\u201d (Lukianoff and Haidt, 2015).  Nonetheless, the common world is built precisely on dissent and conflict. The reality \u201cof the public realm lies in the simultaneous presence of innumerable perspectives and aspects in which the common world presents itself and for which no measure or common denominator needs to be created (...). The end of the common world has come when it is seen only under one aspect and is permitted to present itself in only one perspective\u201d (Arendt 1993: 66-67). In the context of the aforementioned discussions between the democracy models, Iris Marion Young (as cited in Saiz Echezarreta, 2016: 115) argues that an emancipatory policy should foster a conception of the public realm that in principle does not exclude any person, any aspect of people\u2019s lives, nor any topic of discussion, and encourages both aesthetic and discursive expressions. In this conception of the public, the end may not always be consensus and shared criteria, but the recognition and presence of differences, in the context of power struggle.  This would be a model of agonistic democracy (Mouffe, as cited in Saiz Echezarreta, 2016: 115), in which conflict is not only inevitable but offers, in the search for its solution, an inclusive potential (Engelken, 2010). However, as we have seen, the appeal to the recognition of communitarianism is one of the foundations for calling for the criminalisation of hate speech, assuming that these racist, homophobic or discriminatory speeches harm the dignity of each member of the communities attacked, and also assuming a continuity between words and actions, which challenges the idea behind the children\u2019s song that goes \u201csticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me\u201d. As Hume points out, this song \u201ccaptured the attitude that most adults wanted to encourage in their children: to grow up in a free society you have to learn to face the rough and rumble of words and opinions of others without shedding too many tears\u201d (2018: 63).  Incorporating the feelings of the potential receiver into public speech does not necessarily mean that these feelings must be positive. While it is true that empathy, affability, and good humour contribute to creating an environment of understanding, it is also true that dissent is a structural necessity of both democracy and the public sphere. And a criminalisation of hate speech expels, by virtue of emotional harm, positions that  131 have the right to be defended in public space, precisely because they violate certain consensuses and remind us that there are \u201cothers\u201d behind the border of our consensual bubble, some \u201cbarbarians\u201d with other values and views. It is worth recalling Lotman\u2019s idea that it is precisely at the border, as a place of conflict between two worlds of meaning, two semiospheres, where novelties are generated, where the guarantees of the old systems are transformed into new propositions.  Faced with the snowflake model that seeks to isolate citizens in safe environments, oblivious to the noise and fury of a conflicted and rough outside world, it is convenient to claim Sunstein\u2019s idea (1993) that in a democratic society and in a sound public space, the citizen must face other people\u2019s ideas, which have not been voluntarily chosen. In the face of criminalisation or exclusion strategies (deplatforming politics that seek to exclude certain speakers from spaces such as universities, see Fouce, 2016), a vigorous strategy of discursive opposition will establish a frontier from which to reconstruct the arguments and conditions of a more lively democracy.   5. The role of the media in the new public sphere Accepting that the basic condition of democracy is dissent is to assume that public discussion can sometimes offend the feelings of participants. Moreover, while Peirce points out that emotions are at the basis of the creation of meaning of speech, he also defends the need for facts and inductions generated through speech to be the ones to guide the construction of shared belief. The defence of the inductive method requires training in the skills of inference and deliberation and assuming the values of dissent. This public deliberation that allows defining public problems, proposing solutions, and accepting contingent solutions, requires a public sphere to which all voices and positions have access, no matter how conflicting they may be. The media, involved in a process of necessary reinvention to weather the many crises that are taking place today, have begun to propose models that will enable them to become mediating agents of the public sphere (Jarvis, 2015). This mediation can no longer appeal to the old connection between the media and the political elites and their role as gate keepers. Instead, the media should aim to configure meeting points that provide communication solutions to the communities they serve. In fact, one wonders whether the media crisis was, at least partially, caused by their inability to fulfil their responsibilities, to offer their audience tools to maintain democracy: \u201cthe press no longer serves to cultivate certain vital habits: the ability to follow an argument, understand the point of view of others, expand the frontiers of knowledge, decide which of the proposed alternatives should be chosen\u201d (Carey, 1997: 220). Carey (1997: 209), in line with Habermas (as cited in Hermoso, 2019), points out that the way the American Constitution recognised freedom of expression \u2013a landmark for subsequent legislation in the West\u2013 assumes a set of personal provisions and the existence of certain social conditions that are undoubtedly in dispute in the face of the crisis of legitimacy of liberal democracies (Levitsky and Ziblatt, 2019) and the communicative dynamics of social media (Rodr\u00edguez, 2013). The need to create a political space that was radically different from the imperial power and capable of connecting a community that was not united by historical ties promoted a Constitution that defended freedom of expression and assembly as defining instruments of national identity. The stabilisation of democracies mentioned by Heinze (2016) has led to a process of stagnation; citizens have lost the enthusiasm and energy needed to keep democracy in operation as a social system and have allowed the democratic system to be identified merely by its procedures and institutions and not by its civic practices.  We act as if democracy is perpetuated automatically by simply obeying the law and rights. But the law is also a narrative: a set of stories that tell us who we are and where we come from and where we want to go (Carey, 1997: 209). The media have been largely complicit in this process by increasingly eliminating, in the search for profit, street journalism (Davies, 2008) and increasingly accommodating subsidised news, produced by the centres of power. As Carey (1997), Gillmore (2006) and Jarvis (2015) propose, the media will recover their legitimacy when they put themselves at the service of their communities and provide the services that their audiences actually need, in a bottom-up dynamic. One of these services should be providing meeting places for those interested audiences advocated by Dewey (2004). \u201cThe interrelation between meeting, talking and writing... shows that the First Amendment is a mandate to create a conversational society, a society of people who talk to each other... A society of discussion, dispute and debate\u201d (Carey, 1997: 217).  The role of the media in a conversational society requires the media to think about their role in new ways. Now, the public is the one who informs the press and not the other way around. \u201cThe object of journalism is the conversation that the public is having with themselves\u201d (Carey, as cited in Rosen, 1997: 192). Only if  132 the media succeed in becoming relevant spaces of civic debate, they will be able to amplify and guide those habits necessary to connect causes and effects, to draw the inferences that Peirce sees as necessary to reach the state of tranquillity that accompanies belief. However, the media will also be able to channel the irritation and unease generated by the challenges to the status quo: only a public that is trained in the art of discussion can fight hate speech with the weapons of deliberation. In a deliberative space, inhabited by citizens willing to accept its nature as a \u201cnoisy place\u201d (Carey, 1997: 219), emotions have their space. We have the right to be offended, outraged or irritated. But we also have the right to express an irritating and offensive speech. Not only do positive emotions have a place in the public conversation: even people we consider despicable should have the opportunity to express their opinions no matter how abhorrent they may seem to us. It is in the formation of the habit of argumentation where emotions, including those that initiate the signifying process that gives meaning to the world around us, are shaped.   6. Conclusion: the public sphere as a mediation space for emotions The public space, therefore, performs a mediating work (Simondon, as cited in Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn, 2017) and translates emotions into discursive elements and speech into a tool for community action: it is through public and controversial speech (Dewey, 2004) that public problems materialise and are resolved through the laws and norms that oversee everyday life (Gustfield, 1981). Hate speech can be fought through political measures of various kinds, which include the empowerment of minority groups, ensuring their access to the media. As Todorov (2012: 133) states, \u201cit is not enough to have the right to express yourself. You have to get a chance to do it. If you do not get it, that \u2018freedom\u2019 becomes an empty word\u201d. That fight should be fought with the communication policies and responsibility of the media, not with criminal punishment.  If public debate requires a drawer to stand over as a court, one must have access to one. If a microphone is required, then a microphone is needed. If this is done by radio or television, one must have access to these media (Nino, 1997: 193). However, these measures must be adopted as a result of the discussion on how hate speech impacts our common lives, affects different communities and damages democratic life. Countering hate speech in the public sphere ensures the legitimacy of political measures to combat it and creates a \u201csafe space\u201d where emotions must first be transformed into words, establishing a barrier against actions. Rather than artificially creating safe spaces from which harmful emotions and hurtful words are expelled, democracy requires the work of mediation in the public sphere to diminish or eliminate the destructive potential of hate speech. A robust and uninhibited discussion has more capacity to contain hate speech than repressive legislation, which will only create martyrs among those who are denied the opportunity to talk in the name of freedom of expression, engendering a sense of repression that will fuel the amplification of that speech and which, without the mediation space of the public sphere to cushion it, will be directed towards direct action \u2013violence\u2013 once the resources of speech are exhausted.  Assuming this deliberative view does not mean accepting the racist or sexist ideas of those who defend these positions or creating a public space where everything is allowed and where deliberation can be replaced by violence and threats. When words do act as sticks and stones, and are used to silence others through extortion, intimidation and direct incitement to violence, then we will have abandoned the scope of the public sphere (and the protection of the right to free expression), and the State will have full legitimacy to punish such conducts as crimes. The fine line that sometimes separates hostile and offensive speech from violent and threatening speech is not always easy to draw. However, without the mediation space of the public sphere to cushion the impact of hate speech, it heads towards direct action \u2013violence\u2013 once the discursive resources have been exhausted.   7.

To this end, a number of journalistic texts from El Pa\u00eds and Ara newspapers, published over a three-day period from 1-3 October 2017, were analysed. The study sought to penetrate the process of constructing the emotions of media discourses\u2019 recipients, which is parallel to the construction of the narrative in both newspapers. The theoretical and methodological approaches made it possible to examine the manner in which the discourses defined the subject of study, in this case the Referendum of 1-O in Catalonia. In addition, the perspective of this topic within the interaction between the journal and the audience, as well as within the issuer\u2019s strategy oriented toward capturing the audience\u2019s good will and to leading the audience to see and feel the topic in a particular way, was examined.  El objetivo de esta investigaci\u00f3n es estudiar las emociones de los p\u00fablicos tal y como son previstas en los textos. Para ello, analizamos aqu\u00ed una serie de textos period\u00edsticos de los diarios El Pa\u00eds y Ara que forman una secuencia temporal de 3 d\u00edas, del 1 al 3 de octubre de 2017. Nos interesa indagar el proceso de construcci\u00f3n de las emociones de los destinatarios previstos en los discursos medi\u00e1ticos, que es paralelo a la construcci\u00f3n del relato en cada uno de ambos medios. Nos centramos en las perspectivas te\u00f3ricas y metodol\u00f3gicas que observan en los discursos la definici\u00f3n del objeto del que se habla, en nuestro caso el Refer\u00e9ndum del 1-O en Catalu\u00f1a, y su puesta en perspectiva en la interacci\u00f3n enunciativa, en la estrategia del enunciador orientada a captar el inter\u00e9s de su destinatario y a conducirle a ver y sentir ese objeto o asunto en determinada forma.

Introduction The conflict in Catalonia has progressively worsened in recent years. In successive elections, this polarization is reflected in the evolution of the vote won by pro-independence parties, which in 2006 was 13.9%. It approached 50% in 2012, where it remains in 2020 (Ruiz Marull, 2016). (Note that 2011-12 were key years for the economic crisis and political change in Spain). This reversal of the independence vote is an example of how much of the population can transition in certain circumstances from \"sceptical belief\" to full identification with an ideology, a symbolic territory, or a cause, in a process that involves an emotional logic that can follow a progressive and gradual trajectory or quickly move from indifference to passionate identification. (Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn, 2000).  We analyse here journalistic texts from the newspapers El Pa\u00eds and Ara over 3 days, from 1 to 3 October 2017 (the controversial referendum to which we refer was held in Catalonia on the 1st). We aim to understand the process of construction of the emotions of the anticipated addressee in these media discourses (in interaction with their empirical receiver), which parallels the construction of the narrative of both publications. Both El Pa\u00eds and Ara openly express themselves as supporters of one of the conflicting positions, with Ara, a Catalan language publication, being for the \"referendum of self-determination\" in Catalonia and El Pa\u00eds against it, from a position that they define as \"constitutionalist.\u201d They target clearly distinct audiences. Ara is aimed at pro-independence Catalans, an audience presumed to be in favour of the \"unilateral\" strategy defined by the parties of this trend and the Catalan government in this period to achieve the independence of Catalonia. El Pa\u00eds, for its part, addresses an audience distributed throughout the Spanish territory which it assumes to be \"constitutionalist\", at least in the opposite sense of a Catalan referendum on independence, which they considered unconstitutional. The former treats the latter as Spanish nationalists, thereby situating the problem as a conflict between two nationalisms.  In the months leading up to 1-O, we have been able to see in these publications an in crescendo in the emotional tone of speeches perceptible, among other things, in the increase in the degree of accusations against the enemy (anti-democratic, Francoist, insurrectionist, pro-coup, etc.), as well as in the increase in the number of pieces dedicated to this conflict, which become progressively more significant on the front pages of these publications.  We are interested in analysing, first of all, what each text and each publication puts into play for its recipient, as well as how, in communicative interaction with its intended recipient, each publication takes into account the interests, values, and affects of its audience in order to persuade it to see the matter or object in question \u2013 here, the referendum \u2013 \"in a certain light,\" from a certain perspective. Such adopting of perspective is inevitable in any enunciation, since the definition, or \"portrayal\", of an object is correlated to \"the position and interests of the enunciator\", so one\u2019s choice when selecting one of the possible definitions or categorizations always produces a \"perspective effect\", as Fontanille and Zilberberg (2004: 22) point out. Further, we are interested in how this perspective is established in the discourses of these two newspapers, enunciated from and for radically opposed positions and audiences, especially on this key occasion of the pro-independence \"challenge,\u201d as defined by El Pa\u00eds. This process, in which audiences and media have been \"radicalizing\" in relation to the Catalonia-Spain affair, is what we wish to observe here by selecting a small sample from a high point in the conflict, on 1, 2, and 3 October 2017. We focus on the front page of the two chosen newspapers as well as the articles featured on them and continued inside the newspaper. The above question also involves researching how each publication defines and constructs the \"1-O Referendum\" issue for its addressee; what worldviews and values they assume; from what perspective each publication represents its object, its recipient, and its adversary or enemy; what feelings are associated with the rhetorical resources they use to promote their perspective and to describe the other. Our interest, mentioned above, in analysing the public\u2019s emotions as they are anticipated in the journalistic texts involves the analysis of the narrative dimension of meaning, values, actors, imaginaries, frameworks, and figures that each narrative constructs for its recipients.   2. Theoretical-methodological approach. How does one approach this political conflict? For Arendt, the world we jointly build is the object of politics. Political life is formed by actions and discourses regarding the common world, the material and immaterial world of \"objects and issues\" that we all build (1997:118). We understand that the political dimension, in mediatized public space, is not external to the media, but is itself mediatic and takes place in the media space with its languages and resources (Alvarez-Peralta & Cara\u00f1ana, 2018). That is why the media are a central place of power, a basic place in the formation of collectivities of identification. In our case, in  139 studying how the public issue of the \u201c1-O Referendum\" is constructed, we also see the involvement of political-discursive positions that enter into conflict in this sector of the public sphere. Without entering into the complexity of the notion of emotion (affect, feelings, passion, and differences beyond the scope of this article), we will clarify certain aspects. To start, we think of passions from a basic assumption, shared among the social sciences, semiotics, phenomenology, biology, and neurology, which allows us to understand emotion as the sensitive dimension of our relationships with the self, with the other, and with the others (Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn, 2016). This dimension is ubiquitous in our experiences of relation with the world and also, of course, with texts and political conflicts. It is ever-present in the media. According to some authors, emotions are redefining the classical conception of journalistic objectivity and even the idea of news, as the use of emotions to try to involve the audience in the informative speeches becomes increasingly clear and explicit (Beckett and Deuze, 2016). In some current research, the media are understood as \"affect generators\" (L\u00fcnenborg and Maier, 2018; Reckwitz, 2017). Emotions show us humans, and other animals, to be fundamentally relational beings, biologically prepared to feel and react to contact with the material and symbolic environment. We have referred to the intensification of the feelings of confrontation and the \"turn\" to the position favourable to the pro-independence strategy. These emotional processes call to mind the decisive contributions of authors such as Elias Canetti and William Ian Miller.  Canetti separates himself from previous psychological, philosophical, and sociological theories about crowds (von Scheve and Salmela, 2014). Note that the transformation experienced by most people in a situation of war \u2013 or in occasions such as natural disasters, in which they all act together to deal with adversity, etc. \u2013 entails intense involvement of each person in the collective event, to the point that the problems of the collective occupy much of their field of perception, affects, and interests. This phenomenon would correspond to what Canetti (1981) describes as a metamorphosis of the person in the crowd. According to the author, for a number of people to form a crowd, they must have a common direction or goal, even if they are not mass aggregations, but are instead a group people who may not even know each other. This common orientation is also provided by the fact that they share a feeling, which allows Canetti to characterize crowds by their \"dominant affect \" (baiting crowds, fight crowds, feast crowds, etc.) The historian W. I. Miller relates moral values and the sense of primary repugnance, disgust, which for him are intimately linked (Miller, 1998: 38). Moral repugnance, or disgust, occurs, according to Miller, by the failure of the reference point (or the standard) unquestionably incorporated into the subject. \"Most violations of deeply assumed norms are capable of arousing disgust in conditions that show those who transgress them, as a depraved, hypocritical, arbitrary or cruel violator\" (1998:356). This \"unquestionably incorporated\" norm brings us to the second aspect of the emotions we wish to signal: they inseparably involve body and mind. What we know, have experienced, and learned affects what we fear and desire as well as what and how we hate, reject, admire, or love. Certainly, there is an immediate, preconscious reaction, the \"emotion\", as Damasio would say, which is immediately oriented through thoughts and memories, through conscious activity, which gives it a certain form, called \u201csentiment\u201d by Damasio (2006), the secondary feeling, filtered through thought and culture. Without entering into the delicate questions that this raises, but taking into account examples as eloquent as that of disgust, studied by Elias (2009) and by Miller, we assume that certain unthought, preconscious reactions, such as fear or disgust, depend on what the person has experienced as normal, habitual, negative, or strange in their life. Each person's experiences permeate and shape their bodily and affective memories, as well as their encyclopaedia (semiotic memory, Eco, 1990). We must take into account the interaction between the unthought (emotional) reaction and the systems of meaning and value that allow us to think about it and act on it (as a feeling already named and known) precisely as a central question in the analysis of discourses. For this reason, we are interested in observing whether affects are involved in the articulation of experience (Mac\u00f3n and Solana, 2015: 17) and the ways in which we give it meaning and value. \u201cAffect is what sticks, or what sustains or preserves the connection between ideas, values, and objects,\u201d following Ahmed (2010: 230). Always linked to contexts, relationships, bodies, and particular memories, emotions are not only psychological states; they also involve social and cultural practices, habits, and encyclopaedias which are fundamental to produce the surface and the boundaries between the inside and the outside, as Ahmed writes (2004:10), the border between self and others, between the individual and the social. Affects and knowledge, biology and culture, immediate reaction to the situation, short- and long-term bodily memory, and semantics are all intertwined in the emotional experience. There is no mere passivity in feeling; affects act, for example, by altering the public sphere with their emergence (Mac\u00f3n and Solana, 2015: 18), and surely encourage action and the adoption of one attitude or another. There is not only spontaneity in feeling; it also involves \"emotional habitus\" that, operating outside of conscious perception, provide members of a social group \u201cwith an emotional disposition, with a sense of what and how to feel, with labels  140 for their feelings, with schemas about what feelings are and what they mean, with way of figuring out and understanding what they are feeling (Gould, 2009: 34). Studies on the involvement of emotions in the formation of nationalist identities and movements have a long and rich tradition (as synthesized in Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn, 1995). More recently, referring to the politics of identity, Berlant defines \"national sentimentality\" as a \"rhetoric of promise that a nation can be built across fields of social difference through channels of affective identification and empathy\" (2002: 107). In the antagonisms that pit them against other communities, these sentimental identity policies reflect, in addition to the rhetoric of promise, \"the self-evidence and objectivity of a painful feeling and about the nation\u2019s duty to eradicate it\" (2002: 111). Even citizenship is, for Berlant, defined from the feeling of identity: \"Citizenship is a relation among strangers who learn to feel it as a common identity based on a shared historical, legal, or familial connection to a geopolitical space.\" Fellow citizens \"learn to feel\" a \"visceral identification\" of personal identity with the national identity through numerous social and institutional practices in which they participate (Berlant 2014: 38), among which political and journalistic discourses are fundamental. In this sense, we would say that neither Catalan nor Spanish citizenship, which Ara and El Pais respectively claim, can be understood outside the Catalan or Spanish national \"learned feeling of identity\", which they involve. In both, the sentimental politics of social and discursive identity practices, according to Berlant (ibid.), tend to promote and maintain hegemony in a certain form of national identity, despite the persistence of internal differences and antagonisms. For the analysis of the construction of the emotions of the assumed addressees in the journalistic texts, we are interested in the approaches that focus on the perspective of the object of the discourse from the strategy of the enunciator, to observe how it is oriented to affect its receiver, to grasp its interest in order to lead him or her to understand and feel that object in a certain way. This is how Danto's rhetoric is understood, when he states that \u201c[a]s a practice, it is the function of rhetoric to cause the audience of a discourse to take a certain attitude toward the subject of that discourse: to be caused to see that subject in a certain light. \" (1981:165). In this sense, all texts (visual, verbal, artistic, commercial, interpersonal) are rhetorical in that they try to present their object \"in such a way as to cause us to view it with a certain attitude and with a special vision\u201d. (Danto, 1981: 167). We take one attitude or another towards something due, in large part, to how our affects are oriented towards that object and how they intervene, intertwined or articulated with our cognitive and cultural competences as they are, in the meaning and value we give it. This orientation of the affects is the fundamental object of the ancient art of rhetoric. In attempting to lead the recipient to read something \"in a certain light\", the enunciator also tries to have them accept certain assumptions and take them as non-problematic. Thus, we encounter once again the unthinkable and the unquestionable from the sphere of emotions now in semantic-pragmatic territory. The action of the enunciator must define the \"normal\" and the questionable (Meyer: 2008), choose between the various conceptions and the various possible norms, and then make a hypothesis on the encyclopaedia, the norms and values, and the possible interpretation of its interlocutor (Eco: 1990). The specific habits and \" feeling rules\u201d of a collective (Hochschild, 1990) may be found within the norms that are part of a common encyclopaedia and are involved in interpretation. Journalistic information refers to the open occurrences which nobody knows how will end. In principle, they are recounted, as in any news report, \"in media res\", in the present of the day-to-day happenings. A narrative, on the other hand, has an end and includes a closure that offers a key of meaning fundamental to the interpretation of what has been narrated. In every story, a subject pursues an object of value and it is that subject's valuative perspective towards the object that sustains the basic plot, the thread of the narrative (White, 1992). It gives us an idea of the conflict between systems of meaning and value that the subject\u2019s actions puts into play against the obstacles of the world or other subjects in order to achieve his/her object (Greim\u00e1s and Court\u00e9s, 1982: 272). The story defines an object from a double perspective: the exterior perspective of actions and the interior perspective of a subject, informed by its values and visions of the world. For Ricoeur, the story conveys a worldview that is never ethically neutral, but partial and debatable. However, the story always aspires to \"ethical justice\" (Ricoeur, 1985: 359); it is enunciated from the conviction of being in the right. Actors involved in a conflict do often build \"a story\"; they have a project that orients their action towards a goal and a value. They always anticipate and expect an end in which they best their opponent. Ara and El Pa\u00eds, as openly partisan media, define the object, the 1-O referendum, from their respective perspectives, which involve sharing their values and worldviews with their audiences. They build contrasting narratives of conflict, which we analyse here. Further, we must bear in mind that many stories can \"provide what has happened as experience to those who listen\" (Benjamin, 1986:92). The reports of these newspapers provide their audiences with the experience of participating, of involving themselves affectively and according to their values, in the event. These media outlets allow their readers to see their own political choice supported, reasoned, and confirmed by their favourite media, which they have chosen because of these  141 reasons, although they also ask it to maintain a certain \u2018fair play\u2019 with the rules of the journalistic game, with the objectivity and neutrality, in appearance, at least, of public information (Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn, 2014). G. Lakoff\u2019s concept of framing also appears in this line of conceptualizing the construction of meaning as intended to transmit certain assumptions, values, and affects to the addressee. A conceptual framework, or framework of meaning, is a series of coherently organized ideas or concepts that frame the meaning of certain terms or utterances so that they also involve values and emotions. (Lakoff, 2007). This way of arming language with semantic, moral, and emotional implications, often unconsciously, can be capable of defining realities for broad audiences, especially when continually repeated in the media. (Lakoff, 2007). This concept is further explored in R. Entman's studies on journalism: framing involves \"selecting and highlighting some aspects of a perceived reality and enhancing the relevance of an interpretation and evaluation of that reality\" (Entman, 2004: 26). This perspective involves considering the narrative dimension inscribed in the framework, since, according to Entman, a frame can involve the connection between three elements: diagnosis of the situation, attribution of responsibility, and proposal for a solution (Entman 1993: 52). Both the concept of rhetoric as well as those of framework and narrative allow us to focus on the enunciative strategies in the publications studied that are oriented towards a recipient who is not present as a specific individual or group, but rather as an interlocutor-addressee, a central figure that publications must understand and interest in order to communicate. The enunciator, here the newspaper, must know something about how its reader thinks and feels, it must grasp its interest and guide its enunciation in some sense. Whether the enunciator wants to or not, it must select certain preconceptions about the object as well as a certain portion of the encyclopaedia and the memory of its recipient, it must anticipate certain unquestionable suppositions and values and must contribute to reinforcing or questioning them. Inevitably, the texts enter into dialogue with their recipient and mark a strategy in that communication which engages with the systems of meaning, the preconceptions, that allow us to understand and understand our differences.  3. Analysis and results 3.1. Context and perspectives at stake on 1 October 2017. The conflict sparked by the referendum that took place on 1 October 2017 in Catalonia is preceded by the controversial approval of the so-called laws of rupture (leyes de ruptura) in the Parlament by the Catalan independence parties on 6 and 7 September 2017, which legitimize the holding of this referendum of self-determination. From there everything centres on 1-O: whether or not it will be held and if Catalonia intends to become an independent republic in the case that it is indeed held, and the yes vote wins.  The Generalitat (the Catalan government) defined the 1-O referendum as a binding referendum claiming that the very purpose of a democracy is to vote (ignoring the argument that an independence referendum, according to the current Spanish Constitution, should be voted on by the entire Spanish people). The Spanish State prosecuted it as an act of disobedience that threatened the unity of the nation and treated it as a crime through the process of denunciation in the courts. On the other side, a part of the non-independenentist left supported the referendum as a protest or a non-binding citizen consultation. El Pa\u00eds and Ara accepted the frame of a binding referendum, following most of Spain's mainstream media, and clashed in that territory. Other perspectives remained on the margins of this great confrontation. For some, for example, the referendum was a \"trick,\" a political move to gain certain advantages, such as an improved tax accord or more autonomy to continue building a path to independence. According to this interpretation, the Generalitat would pretend to have the strength of a state to compel the central government to negotiate. The Constitutional Court immediately suspended the \"laws of rupture\" and the Supreme Court prosecuted and ordered numerous members of the Generalitat imprisoned. The opposition parties to Catalan independence stressed the break-down of legality, the trampling of the rights of the Spanish population and almost half of the Catalan population, who voted against independence, and the risk of social and political rupture, while the bloc of the independence parties insisted on the right and will of the Catalan people to carry out the referendum and in the dignity that voting confers. Here, Canetti\u2019s conception of conflict gains credibility, in which he claims that each party argues that it has been attacked and is forced to defend itself; each party defines the situation as if it were the victim: we (the \"we\" of the enunciation) have been attacked (Canetti, 1981:175). Similarly, Berlant's aforementioned notion of national sentimental rhetoric, which would unite promise and self-evidence of one's suffering and the duty to eradicate it, becomes apparent. In the stories of both sides, democracy  142 appears as the central value. From the point of view of \"constitutionalism\", Catalan nationalists and the referendum endangers the unity of Spain, the basic principle of the Constitution and the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 2006 (Estatut), terms synonymous with democracy. For Catalan nationalists, they are denied the essential right of every democracy to decide by voting. As we see, in the very definition of the 1-O Referendum case, a fundamental conflict about the definition of the political subject \"we\" of democracy comes to light (Mouffe, 2005). For the constitutionalists it is \"all Spaniards\" who can change the common norm, the Constitution, not just a portion of them, as the unilateralists who hold power in Catalonia intend to do. For the independentists, this subject, the Spaniards, is not relevant in its decisions about \"their\" country, Catalonia. This association of each position with democracy implies an \"agreement on the context of disagreement\" (Saiz-Echezarreta, 2019; Venturini, 2010), from which conflicting strategies of meaning and affect, non-negotiable in the moment, are formed.   3.2. El Pa\u00eds\u2019s Strategy 3.2.1. El Pa\u00eds 1 October 2017 \n The front page of El Pa\u00eds of 1 October 2017 has an unusual composition, since, in addition to a title, a large headline, 4 subtitles and a photo, it includes under the photograph the titles of four opinion articles by very well-known authors: Juan Luis Cebri\u00e1n, Mario Vargas Llosa, Santos Juli\u00e1 and Fernando Savater. Additionally, the lower strip features the beginning of an editorial. The headlines read:  \u2013 Decisive Day for the Independentist Challenge  \u2013 Spanish Democracy Faces its Greatest Challenge Reto and desaf\u00edo, two near-synonyms for \u2018challenge,\u2019 head the page. That which is threatened today in the \"greatest\" way, alarmingly, is the supreme value of our coexistence, democracy. The photograph seems to contrast with this tone of alarm, as it presents a scene marked by normalcy: a well-known Barcelona promenade in which people and families enjoy themselves with complete tranquillity while passing between them young people with Spanish and traditional Catalan flags, not the pro-independence flag. The caption reads,  \u2013 Barcelona\u2019s La Rambla yesterday afternoon, shortly after the protest against the illegal referendum \n 143 Just as the image highlights the small group of young \"unionists\" with the constitutional flags at its centre, the caption focuses the demonstration against the \"illegal referendum\", precisely on the day on which this referendum was held. The headline alludes to this referendum, without explicitly mentioning it, as a major political act. If we understand La Rambla as a symbol of Barcelona, we can read this scene as a representation of the occupation of the Central Catalan space by young constitutionalist citizens. Their youth can be associated here with strength and spirit within the general sense of the normalizing photography of national non-independence symbols in Barcelona. This image that illustrates the day of Catalonia\u2019s \"greatest challenge\" to Spanish Democracy allows us to see the affirmation and normalization of constitutionalist symbols in the heart of Barcelona. However, if we read the image in relation to the headline, as well as the subheadings, some of which read: \u2013 Thousands of people march for unity in Catalonia and in the rest of Spain  \u2013 Pro-Russian networks redouble their interference in defence of the referendum and in relation to the titles of the prominent opinion articles on the front page: \u2013 Political Carnival in Catalonia (J.L. Cebri\u00e1n) \u2013 The Zero Hour (M. Vargas Llosa) \u2013 The National Populist Separation (S. Juli\u00e1) \u2013 The Shield of Liberty (F. Savater) \u2013 El Pa\u00eds With the Estatut (editorial) we observe how the front page as a whole adopts the same rhetorical stance: convincing the audience that \u201cour\u201d most precious object, democracy in Spain, is being threatened and we rise to defend it, it is our cause.  The editorial highlighted on the front page equates the situation with a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Its title literally quotes the title of the editorial that this newspaper published to position itself politically during the attempted coup of 1981. Then \"El Pa\u00eds with the Constitution\", now, \"El Pa\u00eds with the Estatut\", assuming that for its public, Constitution and Estatut are synonymous with democracy, as we have pointed out. The statement is formed as a proclamation, which expresses the attitude of the publication towards the authoritarian pronouncements or \"coups\" of Colonel Tejero in 1981 and of the independentists today. The article situates the reader in front of a possible split in Spain and a collapse: \"What is being wagered today is if the rupture and collapse of the statutory order, already undermined in the Parlament and by the Govern is consummated. Or, on the contrary, if the full force of the Estatut and the Constitution is restored.\" Faced with such a serious diagnosis of the situation, El Pa\u00eds urges its readers to mobilize: the democratic citizens, and with them the publication, are obliged to act. The editorial discourse becomes activist; it is placed in a framework of struggle with certain equivalences in the terrain of the presupposed, the meaning of which is not questioned:  Journalism = El Pa\u00eds = Democracy = Constitution (= Estatut) The supreme value, democracy, presupposed as part of \"our\" indispensable values, of both the media and the public, and identified by the name of El Pa\u00eds (which means \u2018The Country\u2019), allows it to adopt the position of one who does not just represent a party to a political conflict, but instead represents the whole, the Spanish nation and its central value. The current extreme danger in which that value, democracy-Constitution, finds itself pushes \u201cus\u201d to mobilize. Of the four articles featured on the front page of the 1-O issue, Savater's challenges us in the same vein. From its title, \"The Shield of Liberty\", it urges us to defend this value (liberty, also synonymous with democracy), acting ourselves as its shield at a time \u201cjust when our democracy suffers one of the worst and most reactionary attacks of our entire post-war period.\" Savater thusly equates ETA massacres and independence mobilizations. Both attack our democracy and we must go out and defend it as we did with ETA. Santos Juli\u00e1 takes up the editorial's argument. His article, \"The Populist National Break,\" concludes: \"What is already clear is that what has happened to this day is not just about nationalism; it is also a break with democracy from state institutions previously occupied by populist parties.\" Vargas Llosa's piece, \"The Zero Hour,\" carries an enlightening subheading: \"Catalan independence would be tragic for Spain and Catalonia, which would have fallen into the hands of demagogues that would lead to its ruin.\" He then recalls the bloodthirsty and aberrant nationalisms that have terrified Europe: \"We  144 must persuade Catalans that nationalism is one of the worst enemies of freedom and that this dark period must be left behind, like a nightmare that fades upon awakening.\" Juan Luis Cebri\u00e1n titles his article \"Political Carnival in Catalonia\", with a clear tone of contempt, which denies Catalan politics the possibility of participating \"seriously\" in politics in general. The subheading speaks of strength, of Spanish unity, and of weakness, of great danger: \"The independence challenge does not so much affect the possibility of a rupture of Spanish unity, which will not occur, as to the stability of the political and economic process and to the very survival of the present state.\" The carnival reappears in the lead of the article, where the author recalls the \"Franco carnival\" of 1966. Cebri\u00e1n links the current situation with the Franco dictatorship, which in 1966 called a referendum to ratify the State Organic Law, which was, in the words of El Pa\u00eds\u2019s former director, a \"pathetic attempt to institutionalize the regime around something that might resemble a Constitution\".  This rhetoric of conflict is supported by a collective of enunciation, the set of individual and collective voices that make up this front page. The mention of grave dangers aims to arouse fear, coupled with outrage and moral offense, at the despicableness of the enemy who betrays common political rule and order. This collective of unanimous enunciation traces a story that promotes feelings of indignant fear and contempt for politics, those of Catalonia, identified with totalitarianism. The only hope must come from confrontation, from the struggle of constitutionalist Spanish citizenry, legitimate, peaceful, and calm, just like the young people in the photo.   3.2.2. El Pa\u00eds 2 October 2017 \n Like the day before, all the pieces on 2 October 2017 front page are dedicated to Catalonia. It also includes several highly dramatic subheadings, the titles of five opinion articles and the names of their prominent authors \u2013 journalists or regular contributors \u2013 and an editorial. The full-page headlines are: - Serious Institutional Crisis for Generalitat\u2019s Disobedience  - Government forcibly prevents illegal referendum Again, we see terms that state a situation of utmost gravity for the institutions. However, the power of the central government to prevent it is underlined here. The subtitle, also occupying the entire width of the page,  - Puigdemont claims victory in the vote and announces that there will be a unilateral declaration of independence in the coming days, \n 145 presents the president of the Generalitat as determined to consummate the \"coup\". In the image, seven riot officers appear cornered against a gate by a mass of protesters, the end of which is not visible. In the front row, a policeman with a shield separates the citizens from other officers, who carry rifles even though they do not prepare to use them. In front of them, protesters face the policemen in a firm and defiant manner. In a context of dispute, this representation can be interpreted as a challenge to authority. In Canetti's terms, we understand this image as that of a baiting crowd: The baiting crowd is constituted with the aim of achieving a goal quickly (Canetti, 1981: 120). The baiting of the agents by the crowd presents the institutions and powers of the State as victims and permits them to justify the exercise of force that is recounted in the headline: The Government forcibly prevents the illegal referendum. The story can be paraphrased: since the pro-independence citizens are harassing government institutions (mentioned in the subheading) and police forces, the State has been compelled to use force to carry out its legitimate mission (to close the electoral colleges and seize ballot boxes). The caption reads  \u2013 Voters from a Girona electoral college struggle with riot agents from the National Police who came to close the centre and seize the ballot boxes. The subheadings show a strong political conflict. The first refers to altercations, such as the one in the photo, splashed on front pages around the world. - Police and Civil Guard enter the schools in the face of the passivity of the Mossos highlighting the conflict between Spanish and Catalan law enforcement, the Mossos. The three subheadings that follow mention the differences between the leaders of the government, the PSOE party, who asks for negotiation with the (Catalan) Govern, and the Ciudadanos party, who supports the President of Spain. The editorial takes a clear position: \u201cAgainst Insurrection, the Law, but Not Only the Law.\" It is an insurrection, almost synonymous with a coup, so the hard-hitting measures that have been and will be taken by the government and law enforcement are legitimate and necessary, but the publication distances itself from the purely repressive position attributed to the government of Spain: once the constitutional order has been restored, it will be necessary to make policy. The frame changes slightly from the previous day in the articles mentioned on the front page.  - A story of Spain (Adela Cortina)  - The independence of the balconette (Amelia Valc\u00e1rcel)  - This is a referendum... probably (Theodore Lion Gross)  - Under the world's watch (Llu\u00eds Bassets) - Shame (Manuel Vilas)   - Against insurrection, the law, but not only the law (editorial) Several pieces reiterate the framework of extreme confrontation and the definition of the situation remain overblown in some of them (\"pre-civil war environment\" in Bassets' article). On the other hand, in several of these texts, the starting point is the falsity of the referendum, specifically since the Generalitat does not have the strength or sufficient resources to make it binding. Therefore, the authors turn to arguments of contempt, such as that of \"The Independence of the Balconette\", which refers to a false balcony, as opposed to solemn declarations made in solemn spaces. The subheading highlights the lack of dignity of the independentists, who, even knowing that they do not have the strength to declare independence, organize the referendum: \"It is not worthy to mount a referendum that is not one in order to go out again on the balcony to spout proclamations.\" Leon Gross's article also upholds the argument of the falsity of the referendum and explains that it is a ruse and that its perpetrators know it. Referring to Magritte's famous painting, Ceci n'est pas une pipe (This is not a pipe), Leon Gross titles his article \"This is a referendum... probably\" and argues that, like that painting, the referendum is a representation because it does not have any of the legal guarantees that would validate it, just as you can't smoke the pipe in the painting.  Fear of consummation of the \"illegal referendum\" is countered by the power of the government. But the result does not appear as a victory and political divisions also suggest that there is nothing to celebrate, not even the triumph of legality (since \"not only the law\" can resolve this situation, as the editorial claims). The fear and threat that persist, since the Constitutional legality does not impose itself fully., are compensated with contempt for a false battle, of the balconette, of an unworthy enemy.  146  3.2.3. El Pa\u00eds 3 October 2017 \n On 3 October, the front page is almost all dedicated to the Catalan affair, with the exception of the news related to the main photo which shows three young people fleeing a shooting at a concert in Las Vegas and a brief note about the United Kingdom. The trend marked these days by El Pa\u00eds, and on this very front page, of highlighting the Catalan issue, might lead us to think that photography would also be used to address the Catalonia issue, but we see that in principle it is not.  However, the kicker situates us before the unmistakably high tension typical of war-like events: \u2013 Decisive week of the institutional crisis in Spain The expectation that this text refers to something \u2018decisive\u2019 is immediately dashed by the headline:  \u2013 Rajoy and Sanchez do not reach a common response to separatism  A negative enunciation about the leaders of the two main political parties, which implies a reproach for their incompetence (the lack of a \u201cresponse\u201d) in solving a serious crisis. Next to this large headline, another smaller one heads the front page \u2013 The Generalitat picks a day and gathers forces for independence which paints a picture of an imminent declaration of independence. However, a possible \u201ccommon response\u201d emerges in the first main subheading, \u2013 Both PSOE and PP resist applying Article 155 requested by Albert Rivera  In this \"decisive\" moment, the two major parties and their leaders, already singled out as powerless, \"resist\" the proposal of a third party, Ciudadanos, to apply Article 155. This group is referred to twice in the headlines of this front page by the names of its leaders, Rivera and Arrimadas.  The following subheadings address Article 155. One mentions the leader of the PSOE asking for \"dialogue\" with Puigdemont (on the front page of the previous day he asked for \"negotiation\"), and the other stating that Congress \"has not planned to meet\" in the face of the serious crisis. Division and inaction are shown to be key players at this decisive moment, which can only contribute to concern. The layout of this front page creates a central space for three other subheadings, highlighted with touches of color. The first is  \u2013 IN\u00c9S ARRIMADAS, leader of Ciudadanos in Catalu\u00f1a: \u201cThe managing of 1 October by the Government has been a failure\u201d \n 147 The paper does not directly accuse the government, but it voices that accusation on its front page. It does not propose the application of Article 155 but grants space and relevance to that possibility on the front page of the publication. Applying Article 155 of the Constitution involves the intervention by the State in all Catalan institutions (as the government did soon after, although moderating certain measures of control of the institutionality of Catalonia). As suggested in a context we have seen in another of the headlines, claiming that the Generalitat chooses the day and gathers support for independence, might the photograph be related to the headlines? Not directly, but this interpretation remains open in the face of the scenario of imminent danger projected by the front page that could well inspire a similar fleeing.  If on the second day, the framing changes slightly by lowering the tone of a potential coup and projecting the absence of real force of the independentists, on day three we observe another shift of the framework of meaning and the explanatory strategy of the newspaper, this time reproaching and accusing the government and its party, the PP, as well as the PSOE, of failure. El Pa\u00eds defines the situation as a political disaster. Following Arrimadas\u2019 condemnation, negative statements remain in the titles of two articles: \u2013 Calella expels the Civil Guard  \u2013 Pessimism without cure Through testimonies, both illustrate the deterioration of the image of the Spanish state in Catalonia, the protests and demonstrations against the police and \"police violence,\u201d the \"control of the narrative\" by the independentists in the face of the errors, and the impotence of the central government. As newspapers often do, El Pa\u00eds presents itself in these discourses as a voice, an actor in the public sphere who, in addition to reporting a selection of what happens, gives events form and meaning through a discourse of its own. In the case of El Pa\u00eds, this perspective of enunciation is presented as institutional, impartial, and guided by the good of Spain and the values common to democratic citizenship. From this position it judges, justifies, and criticizes actions, while proposing solutions, implying its responsibility as an institutional actor for solving common problems.   3.3. Ara\u2019s Strategy The front pages of Ara, quite different from those of El Pa\u00eds, force us to reflect on images in journalistic communication. In Ara we see an amplification of the image that formally links its front page to the tradition of the Pasquinade or the political poster. More explicitly than that of El Pa\u00eds, Ara\u2019s front page blurs the line between journalism and the discourse of agitation, mobilization, denunciation, etc. typical of an actor, a party in a debate or political conflict.  But the image-text of these front pages participates in the same process as in all communication. Each act of communication starts from a conjecture about the interpretation of the other (Eco, 1990), a conjecture that adapts and develops when the receiver's feedback can be incorporated (as seen in \"market\" and audience studies, and as is commonly done in conversations). Understanding an act of communication requires understanding the dialogue between the participants' systems of meaning, which is done in both words and images, as Danto suggests. Audiences must interpret, translate, and reformulate what they receive from their own encyclopaedias, their stores of knowledge, and experiences of meaning, which tend to be more or less similar to those of the utterer. In the case of Ara in regard to the 1-O Referendum, the publication presupposes a public which clearly identifies with the position and perspective of the newspaper, that of supporting the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (DUI). The semiologists, beginning with Barthes in his Mythologies (1953/1999), showed the overlap of different systems of meaning and the dominant narratives of an era that occur in the banal images of common culture or in objects of consumption. They suggest that the meaning of a text (be it visual, verbal, or musical) is not produced as a sum of independent elements, but rather as the organization of associations between the elements that make up the structure of the common culture. These are cultures organized in semiotic nuclei and peripheries (Lotman, 1998), in inevitable and unquestioned associations which exclude or marginalize the irrelevant or objectionable elements. Thus, in addressing a verbal-visual text, here the front pages of Ara, as an act of communication, it is necessary to question the common ground that the enunciator presumes to share with its intended addressee. These presumptions enable us to understand some of the systems of meaning, value, and affects which the newspaper assumes to share with its readers (an audience with which it has a long-term relationship and knows well). The question of meaning in image-texts will be central to the analysis of these front pages as they relate to the interpretive possibilities that they facilitate, allowing us to respond to what each communicative interaction puts at stake, as we have previously done with the front pages of El Pa\u00eds. Our central task is to question how the front pages of Ara  148 lead the addressee to see and feel something \"in a certain light\" and to accept certain assumptions as unquestionable.  3.3.1 Ara 1 October 2017 \n On Ara\u2019s 1 October 2017 front page, a large graphic shows hands grasping blank ballots, followed by a large headline A les nostres mans (In our hands), both situated on a yellow background (the colour of the independence movement) that covers the whole front page. Just like El Pa\u00eds, although in smaller font, Ara features this issue\u2019s most important contributors on the front page, although it does not include the titles of the pieces, just the authors\u2019 names.  To think that something is in our hands, we must assume that we have the power to act on that object. As the public knows, the referendum is prohibited, so this, what Lakoff and Johnson would call an utterance of authority, (Lakoff and Johnson, 2009:103) acquires more value. While El Pa\u00eds does not specify the \"we\" in communication with the addressee, we see a \"we\" of Ara\u2019s discourse that expressly unites the enunciator with the receiver to recruit them to appropriate the necessary power, power that is \"in our hands\", at our disposal, to achieve what we desire, a compelling reason to vote. The image and the headline are complemented by a clear rhetorical orientation: we want to achieve the same thing and that requires exercising our collective power and going out to vote.  In the hands, which hold up a ballot, we see a representation of the gesture of clutching. The fingers close around the clutched object \u2013 the ballot, in this case \u2013 a symbol of democracy. This gesture of clutching, according to Canetti, is the \"central and most celebrated act of power\" (Canetti, 1981:112). \"The hand that no longer releases becomes the very symbol of power.\" But this front page represents a solid unit of the group reminiscent of crowd crystals: small, rigid groups of people, fixedly limited and constant, that serve to trigger crowds. \"Whoever sees them or lives them must feel, first and foremost, that they will never disintegrate\" (Canetti, 1981:84). Associated with the statement of the headline, the unity of this determined and firm group of hands represents \"our hands\", metonymic and explicitly representing \"us\". It may be paraphrased thusly: \"the common goal is within our reach, we are united and determined, no one can stop us\".  It is certainly intended to produce an exhilarating effect since what is proclaimed by the gesture is the appropriation of democracy. The seven hands grasp the ballots, lift them above their heads, as a banner or proclamation is raised. They are united with firmness and hope to proclaim something, in this case the right and power of the vote. \n 149 In the context of Catalan independence, the yellow background of the front page has a clear meaning, that of demanding the release of politicians jailed since the end of the previous September for refusing to abide by the orders of the Constitutional Court ordering the suspension of preparation for the referendum. In the perspective of independence, the small narrative that defines its frame, in the sense of Entman, states that the problem is the lack of democracy in Spain and the Spanish State is responsible for this deficiency. The solution they propose is to act against the state and vote, which entails an affective dimension that combines anger in the face of a cruel enemy, the hope of making the world more democratic, and the satisfaction of fighting the authoritarianism that denies them their basic rights.   3.3.2. Ara 2 October 2017 \n On this front page a large headline reading \u201cVergonya i dignitat\u201d (shame and dignity) horizontally crosses the page, superimposed on two juxtaposed photographs that occupy almost the entire page. Two smaller headlines in black bands at the upper and lower margin read, \u201cReferendum\u201d and \u201cPuigdemont announces that he will implement the outcome,\u201d respectfully. A third block showing the results of the referendum and the number of injured demonstrators from the previous day completes the design. On the dark backs of the compact group of hyper-protected police with helmets and visors, \"Vergonya\" is written in large type. The image addresses the same police-voter confrontations reproduced in El Pa\u00eds, as well as in in the largest newspapers in the world, although here it takes on the opposite meaning that of its counterpart in Madrid. Ara depicts the police officers as a \"baiting crowd\u201d against the protestors, who resist. Their strength of resistance creates a peaceful confrontation. The mass of \"voters,\" metonymical of the democratic Catalans who attempted to exercise their rights the previous day, do not let themselves be bullied. They stand up for themselves and peacefully confront the armed police, metonymically representing the repressive and violent anti-democratic Spanish state. The repressive violence in the photograph may suggest feelings of anger to its recipients. With the accompanying text reading \"shame\", that anger is coloured by contempt, of \"vicarious shame\", for the \"unpleasant recognition of one's moral and social incapacity\" (Miller, 1998: 171) that should be felt by those who have so acted, in this case the anti-democratic Spanish state, which has been shown powerless in the face of the Catalans' willingness to face it. On the second half of the front page, in contrast to the first, a representation of \"dignity\" is constructed. This dignity is conferred by voting, established as the key sign of democracy. Moreover, when a person who celebrates having voted is elderly, the image recalls the narrative of a long, common independence struggle. She raises her fist, a gesture of power echoing the front page of the previous day, with an expression of triumph and strength in the struggle. The achievement of the elderly woman and the representation of her strength forwards an argument linked to a feeling of hope: the effort of the elderly, supported by young people, as in the image, has borne fruit and shows us the path we must follow. Catalan nationalists assume the honour lost at the hands of their enemies. Under this image, the headline of the lower band \n 150 - Puigdemont announces that he will implement the outcome confirms the reasons for that hope, that victory is near. The third block, on the left side of the page, displays the referendum participation data. After the statistics of the decisive victory of the yes vote (with a 42.5% turnout), comes the \"tally of the wounded\", the index of the decried repression which is a new offense. The day\u2019s triumph is marred by offense.  On these front pages, the majority of what is communicated is at the level of assumption. Supporting itself on an established assemblage of preconceptions, definitions, values, and emotions, the publication proposes a narrative to the reader: we are not a free society; we are forbidden to vote. The onus is on the state, which offends us, represses us, and brings us shame, as it brings shame to every democratic citizen. But we head towards the solution: we act as a collective subject with dignity, in the face of the persistence of power and anti-democratic actions.   3.3.3. Ara 3 October 2017 \n  The front page of the 3-O issue is more complex than the previous ones due to the greater diversity of graphic resources, including advertising, which did not appear in the previous two. First, a strapline opens the front page and encompasses the theme: Referendum. This is followed by another line that mentions the bad situation of IBEX-35 companies. Thirdly, the headline reads: - Puigdemont \"Sa Majestat, aix\u00ed no\" (Your Majesty, not like this),  accompanied by two other statements in smaller font, also attributed to President Puigdemont \u2013 He warns Felipe VI that he has disappointed the majority of Catalans  \u2013 He insists on the path of mediation to find a way forward This second statement links the headline with the main photograph, which shows the interior of the European parliament, the institution to which Puigdemont appeals. Five MEPs show posters about their position in the Catalan conflict. Two are the same and written in English, \"Yes to dialogue, no to violence\", while another two are in Spanish. The first reads, \"Yes to democracy, yes to dialogue, no to violence\", the second, \"Rajoy, step down\". The image presented by the fifth poster appears to show the police violence of 1-O. The caption refers to the first debate on Catalan independence held in the European Parliament:  \u2013 Europe Calls for Dialogue, but Will Not Intercede. Yesterday the European Parliament held its first debate on Catalan independence with few surprises and fewer compromises.  \n 151 This image is presented as an index of the European Parliament's rejection of the Spanish State's reaction in the Catalan case, through a metonymy that takes the part (the MEPs who denounce state violence) for the whole (the chamber with its 751 members). The idea is reiterated in the caption, which states that, while it will not intercede, \"Europe appeals to dialogue\" and therefore stands against violence (by the Spanish state). The rejection of the State is blunt in the headline. Here the State is represented by the figure of its head, the king, and the condemnation comes from the president of the Generalitat: \"Your Majesty, not like this\". It is an utterance of defiance of authority (Lakoff and Johnson, 2009: 103), because if the president of a community, Catalonia, assumes that he can direct the king's behaviour, it is because he feels as if they have the same rights and privileges; he does not recognize the different state hierarchy. The same rhetorical orientation of challenging the state is repeated in the subtitles that accompany the headline. Puigdemont appropriates the position of he who \"warns\" the head of state and calls for European intervention. The figures on these front pages \u2013 the anonymous group of hands, the policemen and protesters, the voters, the European parliamentarians, the president of the Generalitat, and the King of Spain \u2013 play their respective roles in a story that Ara readers know well and which increases in affective intensity at the time of the referendum. Two key aspects of this narrative repeat themselves on these three front pages. Firstly, the absence of democracy in Spain. On the 1-O front page we infer this deficiency from the image of the collective gesture calling for the vote, which proposes to obtain something precisely because it is absent. On day two, this idea is projected through the repression exercised by the state, embodied by the riot police. On the third day it is represented through the MEPs who position themselves against the violence of the Spanish State, taken metonymically as a representation of a protest against Spain by the entire European Parliament. The second key idea repeated on these days is that of the power of the collective subject of this narrative, the population and the pro-independence authorities. On the first front page, this power is projected with the image of his hands clutching ballots, on the second by the resistance of the protesters-voters and the raised fist of the old woman who had just voted, and on the third by Puigdemont's challenge to the King. They all involve stoking or reinforcing feelings of anger toward an enemy and feelings of enthusiasm for one's own cause and power.  4. Conclusions At this key moment in the conflict, both sides pull out the big guns. On 1 October the pro-independence movement carried out the prohibited referendum, even with problems of legitimacy, and despite obstacles from police, judges and the central government. Images of police repression attempting to prevent the vote and facing the resistance of the people took over the front pages of the world's main media on 2 October, which caused a serious questioning of the Spanish state. On the constitutionalist side, they maintain that \"the government prevented the referendum\" (since the vote that was made did not meet legal requirements) and on 3 October proposed the drastic measure of abolishing Catalan autonomy through the application of Article 155 of the Constitution. However, neither side emerges with a definitive victory.  We note that the discourses of Ara and El Pa\u00eds reflect the existence of two \"emotional communities\", sustained by their own standards of evaluation and emotional expression (Rosenwein 2012: 25; Mac\u00f3n and Solana, 2015: 31). As we have demonstrated, emotions, intertwined with beliefs and narratives, are fundamental in the definition of the two \"we\" subjects who enter into conflict in this situation as well as the definition their enunciative strategies. Both regard themselves as the only legitimate political subject of democracy, which their enemy jeopardizes.  This political danger is projected as a threat that affects each individual and unites individual affective experience with the framework of collective representation. Boucheron and Robin (2019:48) recall that for Hobbes one of a sovereign's most important functions is to decree, plainly and evenly, whether or not a nation is threatened. Fear of this greater danger is key in the narratives of both papers, which identify the object their audience should fear, explain the reasons for their danger, and propose confronting it. The threat against \"us\" and our values is a central component in forming the \"learned feeling\" (Berlant 2014) of national identity. Both narratives present a cluster of outrageous acts, abuses of power, etc. of their respective opponent. This repetition of offenses fulfils the rhetorical role of stoking the recipient's anger and at the same time legitimizing it. This is not an emotional attitude against the other held a priori, but a reaction that is substantiated with evidence and rationally argued. The difference between illegitimate violent rage and  152 justified, rational, and peacefully expressed rage is key to the mediatization of public protests (Wahl-Jorgensen, 2018: 2078). This conception here is also fundamental to give form to an emotion \u2013 anger \u2013 and present it as well-justified by the improper actions of the other, exposed as \"conscious\" violation, an \"abuse\" of and \"contempt\" to the rights of all. The discourses of both publications make a moral and affective definition of the situation and their opponent. The enemy arouses \"our\" strong opposition, anger and contempt. Each side associates the other with vices such as cruelty (because of the harassment suffered by each other), betrayal (of democratic principles), and hypocrisy (some enter the institutions to destroy them and the others are claimed to be led by an anti-democratic state). The insistence on these vices tends to naturalize feelings of contempt and disgust.  But each side also joins these negative emotions (fear, anger, contempt, disgust) to others (Jasper 2012), such as satisfaction in one's own strength, enthusiasm to fight for a just cause, and the desire to prevail, that are indispensable to counter negativity and to try to mobilise its audience for confrontation. The emotions of combat, in any case, are not exalted nor are they an expression of an uncontrolled passionate subject. Quite the contrary, they emerge as controlled and are widely justified rationally; they underline their own non-violence whenever possible, even in the face of the violent actions of the opponent. Violence against the citizenry is incompatible with democracy in our common imaginary (Lorusso, 2011) and the discourses of the parties in conflict try to attribute violence to the opponent or to justify it on their own side. Thus, Ara underlines the police repression of 1-O and, with the word \"Vergonya\", alludes to the watchful eyes of a third party, other democratic countries, to whom this repression is unacceptable (given that their public is familiar with the international media\u2019s condemnation of this repression, widely collected in common media spaces). Conversely, in El Pa\u00eds's image, armed police can barely protect themselves from harassment of the crowd.  In addition to channels of affective identification and empathy, does the rhetoric of these speeches offer hope, as does the \"national sentimentality,\" according to Berlant? In Ara, the referendum figures as a clearly hopeful step in the \u201cproc\u00e9s\" towards the ultimate objective of a determined, firm, and just collective movement pursuing their right to independence. The narrative of El Pa\u00eds is not as hopeful. The offense that constitutionalists face is the threat to the status quo, and to repair that offense is to repair such a status quo. There is no promise of change for the better, except to win the fight, which would amount to returning to the starting point prior to the commotion caused by the \u201dproc\u00e9s\u201d. Both narratives are clearly opposed by their definition of their respective \u201cus,\u201d by their objectives, and their conception of the enemy, but their enunciative strategy is very similar: given the serious diagnoses of the situation that each party projects, the democratic citizenry is obliged to act. In both cases the editorial discourse becomes activist and adopts the position of those who represent not a party in a political conflict, but rather a whole: the nation (Spanish or Catalan) and its raison d'\u00eatre, the democracy by which it is governed. This approach is much more explicit in Ara, which, as we have seen, formally approximates the political poster with its front page. El Pa\u00eds, on the other hand, uses the mask of impartiality. However, the discourses of both publications show a partisan enunciation. The radicalization of the conflict takes these newspapers away from the sort of enunciation by an impartial observer and clearly shows them as \"affect generators \" who seek to politically guide and emotionally involve their audiences in their discourses.  5.

Within this context, the emergence of both alternative practices and coping strategies in the field of consumption is no longer represented as a problem or a public controversy, but as a trend embedded in youth lifestyles. From a critical approach and based on a sample of 24 articles published in the digital press between 2014 and 2019, this de-problematisation was explored employing two analytical tools: relexicalisation and reframing. The strategic replacement of certain terms by others which are less connotative affords a new frame creating a new interpretation of the phenomenon. Finally, the appeal to welfare and its presentation as an opportunity for personal transformation contributes to this naturalisation, enhancing the symbolic effectiveness of these discourses.  El objetivo de este art\u00edculo es analizar la construcci\u00f3n discursiva en torno a la trendinizaci\u00f3n de la precariedad juvenil en la prensa digital espa\u00f1ola, donde la emergencia de pr\u00e1cticas alternativas y estrategias adaptativas en la esfera del consumo es representada ya no como un problema o una controversia p\u00fablica, sino como una moda inscrita en los estilos de vida juveniles. Desde una aproximaci\u00f3n cr\u00edtica y a partir de una muestra de 24 art\u00edculos publicados en prensa digital entre 2014 y 2019 se explora esta desproblematizaci\u00f3n a partir de dos herramientas anal\u00edticas: la relexicalizaci\u00f3n y el reenmarque. La sustituci\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica de ciertos t\u00e9rminos por otros con menor carga connotativa posibilita un cambio de marco que da lugar a una nueva interpretaci\u00f3n del fen\u00f3meno. Finalmente, la apelaci\u00f3n al bienestar y su presentaci\u00f3n como una oportunidad para la transformaci\u00f3n personal contribuye a esta naturalizaci\u00f3n, potenciando la eficacia simb\u00f3lica de estos discursos.

Introduction  Friganismo: la \u00faltima dieta h\u00edpster es coger comida de la basura  Freeganism: the latest hipster diet is getting food out of the garbage [1] (El Pa\u00eds \u2013 Tentaciones. March 24th, 2016).  Tiny House, el nuevo concepto de vivienda que ha llegado a Europa y que ya arrasa Estados Unidos  Tiny House, a new housing concept has arrived in Europe and is on the rise in the USA (El Mundo. November 23rd, 2017).  Dumpster diving, la moda de buscar \u201ctesoros abandonados\u201d en los contenedores de basura  Dumpster diving, the trend of looking for \u2018abandoned treasures\u2019 in dumpsters (El Mundo \u2013 Fcinco, June 3rd, 2018). Freeganism, tiny houses, and dumpster diving are merely three examples of the ubiquity of the expansion of precarity and its contemporary manifestations, as pointed out by Bourdieu (1999). It is a precarity that is \u201cpresent at all times, in all minds\" (1999: 121) and that, in our days, is expressed through a wide array of heterogeneous discourses and diverse trajectories and practices. Precisely because of its multidimensional and multiform character, precarity constitutes a \"category in expansion\" (Somoza, 2016: 248) that affects not only the sphere of work but extends over the totality of life. Along the same lines, its effect is not restricted to the popular classes alone but acquires an increasingly evident impact on the lifestyles of the young middle classes (Alonso, Fernandez Rodr\u00edguez and Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Rojo, 2017). From eating out of the garbage to living in tiny houses to sifting through dumpsters in search of discarded objects, all of these practices illustrate the mediatization of processes of youth precarity as translated into trend models. The goal of this article is to examine this process of trendinization (Mart\u00edn Rojo, Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez and Castillo Gonz\u00e1lez, 2020: 98) undertaken by the media in recent years, which has led to conceptualizing the impoverishment of young middle classes in terms of a \"non-conflictive adaptation\u201d (Alonso, Fern\u00e1ndez Rodr\u00edguez and Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Rojo, 2011: 357) and as a desirable lifestyle. Together with media logics such as spectacularization [2] (Debord, 1967; Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn, 2017) and aestheticization (Pardo, 1998), trendinization presents the described practices in light of an emerging new trend, as an opportunity and a personal choice that is embedded in people\u2019s lifestyles and which, as we shall see below, is presented as beneficial for emotional well-being. As can be seen in the previous headlines, this trendinization is built into media discourse and manifests itself in the deployment of resources and discursive strategies that minimize the most harmful aspects of the process of precarization, while also granting preeminence to others, circumscribed to the terrain of the anecdotal. In this sense, media as active generator of frames (Tarrow, 1997), and in particular digital press, have echoed these practices recurrently over the last years, giving rise to increased media production around these issues. The deep changes produced in the social structure after the economic crisis of 2008, together with the expansion of neoliberal policies of the last decade, have placed the processes of impoverishment, precarization, and loss of social status as objects of attention in the establishment of the media agenda (McCombs and Shaw, 1972) over the last five years. This journalistic attention has run parallel to the emergence of a discursive change that has subverted the news outlets\u2019 treatment of precarity as a social problem - stripping it of the category of public problem - (Gusfield, 1991), and turning it, therefore, into a new normality that promulgates \"new trends for new forms of life\" (Moruno, 2018: 22). Through a discursive approach, this article examines the mediatization of these processes of youth precarity that affect the descending middle classes. To this end, I propose an analysis of how trendinization is discursively constructed and which mechanisms participate in this process; I then subsequently address the performative potentialities of these discourses in their normalization beyond the specific practice of these trends. Be as it may, the aim is not to carry out a socio-affective analysis of the phenomenon based on the sociology of emotions (Bericat, 2000; Hoschild, 1975, 1979), but to illustrate how this trendinization operates at the discursive level. I examine the extent to which this discursive turn acts as a strategic element at the service of self-discipline (Alonso et al., 2011), which produces high levels of self-satisfaction in contexts of high precarity. I will first show the discursive shift on which the trendinization of precarity is based, and then present the methodological framework and the analytical tools. Finally, I conclude with a critical reflection on the role played by emotions, and more specifically, positive thinking (Ehrenreich, 2011) and self-induced optimism in the mediatization of the phenomenon.  157 1.1 Pluralizing precarity: from shame to trend Precarity has become a central concern of contemporary societies in recent years, as well as a preferred object of study in the social sciences from very different approaches and dimensions (Santamar\u00eda, 2018). Its growing academic interest places it as an \"inexhaustible subject\" (Santos and Mu\u00f1oz, 2017: 240) whose analysis is not restricted or exhausted in academic circuits alone but, given its centrality in our model of social organization, also receives much media attention. This journalistic interest has been revealed as central in relation to consumer practices and lifestyles youth deploy as a response to the \u201cnew precarities\u201d (Maurin; 2006; Mu\u00f1oz and Santos, 2018, 2019) that leave their mark not only on the sphere of work, but act on the totality of life (Alonso, 2008; Lorey, 2016; Zubero, 2006). This condition refers to a broader precariousness, which \"is equated to uncertainty, insecurity and lack of protection\" (Santamar\u00eda, 2009: 35). The multi-layered character of this phenomenon places us, in line with Foucault, within a \"biopolitical precariousness\" (Santos and Mu\u00f1oz, 2017: 241) that \"unfolds in extenso in the life of young people and in the politics of life\" (2017: 240), ultimately shaping their life trajectories. Because this process affects the middle class, which is traditionally protected from worsening living conditions (Alonso et al., 2017; Mar\u00ed-Klose et al., 2016), the reach of these forms of precarity on young people from the middle classes has received great consideration in public discourse over the last decade (Gil Rodr\u00edguez and Rendueles, 2019).  This \"destabilization of the stable\" (Castel, 1997) has had powerful effects on consumption as a structuring element of identity (Alonso, 2005). In parallel, this has led to a readjustment of consumption patterns and habits (Alonso, Fern\u00e1ndez Rodr\u00edguez and Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Rojo, 2011) that has materialized in different ways depending on the segments affected and the type of capitals (Bourdieu, 2001) that destabilization mobilizes and compromises. Given that \u201cthe precarious condition implies a model of consumption that is completely disconnected from access to property\u201d (Alonso, Fern\u00e1ndez Rodr\u00edguez and Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Rojo, 2016: 361), we have witnessed the development of non-conventional practices in the field of consumption in recent years that account for such impact and show alternative ways and strategies of accumulation. Among them, for example, are new eating patterns, such as eating out of dumpsters (freeganism) or cooking with food waste (trashcooking), as well as housing formulas such as co-living, the use of commercial spaces for residential purposes or the emergence of so-called tiny houses. All of these practices refer to multiple dimensions and diverse meanings [3] of precarity, hence our need to pluralize the concept (from precarity to precariousness) (Cingolani, 2014: 49) in light of the new \"expressions\" (Santos and Mu\u00f1oz, 2017) and \"modalities\" (Tejerina et al., 2012) with which it manifests. This multidimensionality has already been highlighted by authors such as Lorey, who through categories such as \"heterog\u00e9neos precarios\" (2016: 23) (roughly translated to \u201cdiverse precarious people\u201d) draws attention to the variety of trajectories and profiles that this condition illustrates. From this perspective, I propose a multidisciplinary study of trendinization based on a broad conceptualization of precarity and using a critical discursive approach that reveals the strategies that produce it.   1.2 New discourses for new precarities This trendinization, as pointed to at the beginning, entails important discursive changes that contribute to building a certain interpretation of the phenomenon of study, while also having performative effects that transcend the materiality of the discourse. From this prism, the emergence of these practices, considered a priori as novel, has run parallel to the circulation of new discourses that de-problematize their most detrimental aspects, presenting them, instead, as an individual and fundamentally elective issue. In addition, there is an ethical component that links these practices to recycling, reuse, and sustainable consumption (Alonso, Fern\u00e1ndez Rodr\u00edguez and Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Rojo, 2014) and therefore makes them more attractive, pleasant, and easily integrated into daily life. Thus, in the face of the conflictive and/or punitive dimension that usually penetrates or weighs on discourses of poverty and social insecurity (Wacquant, 2010) along with the recurrence of shame (Sennett, 2003) or guilt as stigmatizing elements linked to the situation of poverty, we find a discursive framework that subverts the press\u2019s conventional treatment of the processes of precarization as a public problem. Instead, we are witnessing a de-dramatization of the phenomenon in the public sphere supported by the deployment of a new discursive order that conceptualizes deprivation and its adaptive strategies as a matter of style, sublimating this experience.  2. Methodology In order to characterize the discursive formation and to analyze the constitutive features around this new mediated -and social- understanding of youth precarity in the middle class, I propose a critical approach  158 to the study of discourses that integrates our object of study. To this end, I have compiled an ad hoc corpus of 24 journalistic articles, [3] published in the digital generalist press (native and non-native) between 2014 and 2019. Since the purpose of this work lies precisely in analyzing a set of cases that, by their nature, present an intrinsic interest in discovering meanings, the data collection has been gradual and in accordance with the principles of theoretical sampling (Glasser and Strauss, 1967). In this way, and until discursive saturation is reached, the units of analysis have been selected according to the relevance of the described cases and not according to their representativeness (Flick, 2012). Through the critical discourse analysis (CDA) approach that I adopt in this paper, my position moves away from both a pre-modern vision of discourse as a reflection of reality and a solipsistic vision that only recognizes the existence of discourse. On the contrary, this approach brings together the recognition of the generating power of discourse, in which representations of events, groups, actors, and social practices are constructed. On the other hand, it considers not all discourses as possible, but rather that there are conditions of possibility in a particular time and place that allow them to emerge and circulate. This position, rooted in a Foucauldian perspective, connects the emergence of discourse with the different forms of governance. Thus, discourses that emerge in a specific time and place, like those studied here, are an essential part of political rationalities, that is, they generate knowledges and are linked to forms of power (Mart\u00edn Rojo, 2020). From this position, Los discursos no reflejan la \u201crealidad\u201d, no son un espejo fiel de \u00e9sta, sino que construyen, mantienen, refuerzan interpretaciones de esa \u201crealidad\u201d, es decir, construyen representaciones de la sociedad de las pr\u00e1cticas sociales, de los actores sociales y de las relaciones sociales que entre ellos se establecen (Mart\u00edn Rojo, 1997a: 1-2). Hence, this work pays particular attention to tracking down these signs or discursive resources that participate in the construction of these interpretations in media discourse (Van Dijk, 1990). In line with the CDA's assumptions, and from an attentive look to the context and the performative capacity of these discourses, this approach allows us to \"demystify discourses\" (Wodak, 2003: 30). This pushes us to interrogate, problematize, and denaturalize what is presented to us as given (Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez, 2019) or as part of an imaginary that is anchored in shared common places, relating discourses to the social processes in which they are produced. In the case examined here, this discursive shift connects with a certain vision of precariousness and the construction of agency that is revealed through four discursive procedures. Although the analysis here is focused on the first two, it should be noted that all of the following play a role: 1. A process of relexicalization in which, as we will see, \"old words are replaced by new ones\" (Halliday, 1998: 214). This substitution affects certain areas of the vocabulary linked to ways of life (including food, housing, work, leisure, etc.), thus conveying different subjective experiences and interpretations of reality.  2. A new frame that is activated, in line with Lakoff's (2007) theory of cognitive frames, through lexical selection and leads to a reinterpretation of the action (Goffman, 2006). For example, instead of expressing poverty as a trait through a phrase like \"rummaging through garbage\", relexicalization to \"treasure hunting\" allows an interpretation of the phenomenon as a trend (freeganism). 3. A remarkable discursive heterogeneity that contributes to the construction of a positive image of the phenomenon, through the hybridization of hegemonic discourses and alternatives ones, which gives rise to a discursive ambivalence. This can be observed in the assemblage of (inter)discursive borrowings that come from as diverse of scopes as activism, ecology, and entrepreneurship. Thus, for example, apps that distribute restaurant leftovers activate ecological arguments against waste and in favor of sustainability in order to become a business that makes that reuse profitable.  4. This combination of different elements ultimately allows the emergence of new discursive genres in the media ecosystem that often transgress narrative and stylistic conventions. They circumscribe the story to the sometimes confessional (Inoue, 2006) experience of the journalist themself to achieve reader identification. This is the case, for example, in the article entitled \u201cEverything I\u2019ve learned by eating out of the garbage\u201d (\u201cTodo lo que he aprendido comiendo de la basura\u201d, in Spanish), where the journalist makes use of a youthful colloquial register, expressed in the use of the first person, to narrate the subjective experience of those who have incorporated this new practice into their lifestyle. The new register, far from the vindicated media objectivity, is characterized, as is anything trending, by the strategic use of English (freeganism, dumpster diving, etc.). What\u2019s more, it becomes strongly convincing because it fulfills two major functions: on the one hand, it allows the dissemination of the new frame and, on the other hand, it has a legitimizing function of the described practices.    159 3. Results In the following sections I will share some of the results of the analysis of our corpus. Due to space limitations, I will focus on two of the discursive strategies (relexicalization and reframing), both of which are crucial to the operation of the discursive shift referred to above.  3.1 Relexicalization The process of relexicalization is fundamentally a selective operation; that is, it affects some areas of the vocabulary and not others. Both the choice of those aspects of social reality that will be emphasized and the language that will be used for their representation converge in this process. In the following examples, we see how this lexical selection, through a reflexive use of language, is expressed through terms such as \"ventajas\" (advantages) (example 1), \"furor\" (frenzy) (example 2) or \"molar\" (to be cool) (example 3). The interpretation of such lexical items infuses a positive quality into the different practices and experiences of precarity they refer to, while also allowing for an inversion of their meaning. In example 1, we see how the journalist recounts her (forced) move to the periphery and selects the term \"advantage\" to qualify it, instead of another more typical and expected one within the still existing frame of reference that points out and emphasizes its negative effects. 1. Estas son las ventajas de vivir lejos del centro por culpa de la gentrificaci\u00f3n  Here are the advantages of living farther from the center because of gentrification (El Pa\u00eds \u2013 Tentaciones. April 1st, 2018)  2. El furor de las minicasas The tiny house frenzy (El Pa\u00eds \u2013 Negocios. November 4th, 2017)  3. Manifiesto de los \u2018treinteenagers\u2019 o por qu\u00e9 los 30 molan m\u00e1s que los 20 The \u2018thirtyteens\u2019 manifesto or why your 30s are cooler than your 20s (El Mundo \u2013 Fcinco. May 29th, 2016) In this sense, lexical selection plays a decisive role in the process of trendinization and permits a change in the construction of representations insofar as it attenuates the pejorative elements that generally accompany these practices. From this perspective, the processes of precarization with regard to housing are de-problematized to the point that the imposition of moving to the periphery due to gentrification is perceived as an \"advantage\" (example 1). Similarly, the proliferation of real estate with a surface area of less than forty square meters causes \"furor\" (\u201cfrenzy\u201d in English) (example 2), which shows the emotional intensity that generally characterizes these types of practices. In the final example (3) we find, however, a somewhat different relexicalization. Instead of a substitution of what would usually be the selected term, a new category is created, the \"treinteenagers.\" This hybrid term, a blend of Spanish word for 30-year-old (\u201ctreinta\u00f1ero\u201d) with the English category of \u201cteenager,\u201d represents the life of non-adolescents as a form of adolescence. The creation of this lexical unit makes integrating the lives of 30-somethings with those of adolescents possible, discrediting their difficulties of being on their own, as illustrated by the fact that only one in five young people under the age of 30 can become independent (Consejo de la Juventud de Espa\u00f1a, 2019). This positivization is declared, hence the use of the term \"manifesto\", as a phenomenon that \"is cool\" (example 3). As can be seen from this last example, the use of blending, such as treinteenager, and its Spanish counterpart \"adolestreinta,\"[5] again resulting from the combination of thirty-year-old (treinta\u00f1ero in Spanish) and teenager (adolescente), is another common relexicalizing procedure that contributes to the sublimation of these events. This is the case for the term trabacaciones (example 4), where the combination of vacation (vacaciones) and work time (trabajo) is presented as a new strategy for the management of one's professional career. 4. Trabacaciones en retiro: otros turismos emergentes  Workcation Retreat: Other Emerging Tourisms (El Pa\u00eds \u2013 Retina. October 8th, 2018) The same goes for the use of the term \u201cfriganismo\u201d, (freeganism in English), which is derived from the combination of the English words \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cveganism,\u201d used to designate the practice of eating salvagable food scraps found in the garbage. 5. Friganismo: la \u00faltima dieta h\u00edpster es coger comida de los contenedores de basura Freeganism: the latest hipster diet is getting food out of the garbage  160 (El Pa\u00eds \u2013 Tentaciones. March 24th, 2016) This term, which refers to the Freegan movement (see freegan.info) and promotes strategies for \"sustainable living beyond capitalism\" has been trended through the strategic selection of a set of terms that attribute positive values. As a result, this previously stigmatized \"diet\" gains its new, current meaning as demonstrated by the use of the syntagma \"the latest diet.\" It is also linked to the prestigious youth subculture of the \"hipster.\" This intentional and reflexive use of language indexes class positions in relation to a young, urban, and educated style of speech and permits the construction of a new point of view regarding socially condemned practices such as eating out of the garbage.  Acronyms constitute, along with the portmanteau observed in the two previous examples, another effective nomination strategy to reverse this disapproval and thus achieve a change of meaning that makes the process of trendinization possible. An example of this is the use of the word sinkies in the following example (6): 6. Llegan los \u201csinkies\u201d, j\u00f3venes en pareja pero sin planes de tener hijos  The \u2018sinkies\u2019 have arrived, young couples without plans to have children (ABC. December 9th, 2017)  This category, coined by C\u00e1ritas Europa (2017), brings together young couples whose salaries barely cover the amount of a decent \u201csingle income,\u201d hence their inability to develop autonomous life projects such as raising a family (\u201cno kids\u201d). However, instead of drawing attention to the risk of exclusion that threatens this generation, this acronym is used to point to its novelty, as is made explicit in the use of the verb \"to arrive\" (llegar in Spanish) and in line with the rhetoric of choice, suggested by the term \"plans\" (planes).  Ultimately, the use of neologisms is substantive to resignify the emergence or recuperation of practices traditionally linked to situations of misery as novel. This procedure allows for the substitution of words and/or expressions such as \"eating out of the garbage\" for others with less negative connotation such as \"practicing freeganism,\" as indicated in example 5. In this context, new terminology emerges that shows how uncertainty and worsening living conditions are inscribed in youthful lifestyles, contributing to increasingly unstable life trajectories. This discontinuity is reflected in the use of expressions such as \"homo nomadus\" (example 7) which, in line with the neoliberal paradigm of mobility, extols the virtues of mobile architecture. 7. \u2018Homo nomadus\u2019: as\u00ed es vivir con la casa a cuestas  \u2018Homo nomadus\u2019: this is life with your house on your back (El Mundo \u2013 EME. March 16th, 2018)  This positivization is also transferred to the field of food patterns, where we witness the emergence of anglicisms such as \"trash cooking\" (examples 8 and 9) that illustrate the phenomenon of cooking with waste or garbage.  8. Cocina de aprovechamiento: trucos para sacar al Trash Cooking  Cooking with what you\u2019ve got: tricks to start Trash Cooking (El Confidencial \u2013 Alimente. November 1st, 2018)   9. Diez modos de practicar el trash cooking vegano en casa  Ten ways to practice vegan trash cooking at home (Eldiario.es \u2013 Consumo Claro. May 26th, 2018  These designation strategies, based on the use of anglicisms, are commonly used to legitimize and present the adaptive mechanisms deployed by the young middle classes as desirable. Given their deliberate use of English, they act as an element of social distinction, as might be inferred from the following example where the term \"nesting\" relates to the habit of spending the weekend at home (that is, in the nest). When imported from English-speaking countries, mainly the United States, the trends, i.e. trending, are named in English. 10. Nesting, como en casa en ning\u00fan sitio Nesting, there\u2019s no place like home (El Mundo. April 24th, 2017) In this case, the positive presentation of the phenomenon is manifested both in the use of the term \"nesting\" and in the evocation of a common place through the idiom \"there\u2019s no place like home.\" This appeal to  161 the shared social imaginary allows its decontextualization and naturalizes the represented practice by avoiding delving into its causes and consequences, supporting an uncritical reading of the phenomenon and contributing to its social acceptance. On top of this, on more than a few occasions these headlines incorporate the affective dimension into the mediatization to increase their symbolic effectiveness, as shown in example 11. 11. No salir de casa en todo el fin de semana rebaja la ansiedad e ilumina la mente  Staying at home all weekend reduces anxiety and illuminates the mind (El Pa\u00eds \u2013 BuenaVida. March 29th, 2017)  In line with the previous example, staying at home appears to be intrinsically linked to psychological well-being, again giving a positive orientation to this set of practices. In this way, selection gives primacy to the most original, extravagant, and anecdotal aspects of the process of precarization. This both functions as a criterion of newsworthiness and conceals the conditions and social processes that allow the emergence of a new discursive order. This relexicalization ultimately enables the construction of a different interpretation of poverty. In this sense, relexicalization is linked to the discursive construction of a new view of certain situations, practices, and those who carry them out or experience them. The representation of the pejorative elements linked to stigma and exclusion, the result of a punitive view of precarious subjects, is transformed into another that presents them as in fashion and/or as an opportunity that distinguishes, instead of shaming, those who participate in them. The question that arises, then, is what makes this interpretation and its persuasive dissemination possible. It is at this point that the concept of \u2018frame\u2019 offers some answers.  3.2 Reframing  As Lakoff (2007) points out, based on Fillmore's work on frame semantics, the evocation of a term, or rather the substitution of one term for another, is enough to activate a frame that makes a different interpretation of events possible. The frame is, therefore, a shared cognitive model, a mental structure that encompasses a definition of the situation and/or the participants involved in it, drawing on William Thomas's proposal. As we have seen, relexicalization promotes the reframing of the described practices by means of lexical selection (like \"nesting\" in the previous example), which is crucial to invoke a new frame that allows the interpretation of these youthful precarities as part of a trend. Reframing constitutes, therefore, another of the procedures that most actively contributes to trendinization and the construction of youthful precarity and its experience as a newsworthy event. Given that reframing is inextricably linked to relexicalization, the substitution of some terms for others with less of a connotative load reframes the action and, as a result, fosters a change in media representation. Through the frame analysis we observe that there underlies an organizational principle, common to all of the analyzed articles, by which these practices are represented as in-fashion trends in accordance with the \"new lifestyles and distinctive consumptions\" that characterize the \"new times of the postfordist consumption\" (Alonso, 2004: 30). This transformation is evidenced through the use of frame terms that evoke the lexicon of trend and novelty, as can be inferred from the following headlines (examples 12 and 13): 12. La moda de convertir un local en vivienda regresa a las calles The trend of turning stores into houses returns to the streets (El Pa\u00eds \u2013 Negocios. February 24th, 2018)   13. Dumpster diving, la moda de buscar \u201ctesoros abandonados\u201d en los contenedores de basura Dumpster diving, the trend of looking for \u201cabandoned treasures\u201d in dumpsters (El Mundo \u2013 Fcinco. June 3rd, 2018)  The stabilization of this frame is given by the use of the word \"trend\" (moda, in Spanish), which immediately evokes a frame in which people voluntarily follow a trend instead of being condemned to a given situation. In this way, a single word guides the terms in which these practices are discussed and (re)presented and mobilizes a certain interpretation of the events being narrated, thus demarcating the limits of what is sayable. From this perspective, living in commercial spaces and sifting through dumpsters in search of discarded objects are current phenomena that are anchored precisely in the novelty that accompanies such practices, as revealed by the use of the verb \"to return\" (regresar, in Spanish) (example 12) and \"to establish\" (plantarse) (example 15). This invocation of novelty is another of the attributes that decode this frame in the analyzed articles, which is also considered a criterion of newsworthiness that supports the creation of this type of content and its treatment as events of public interest.  162 14. Tiny House, el nuevo concepto de vivienda que ha llegado a Europa y que ya arrasa Estados Unidos  Tiny House, a new housing concept has arrived in Europe and is on the rise in the USA (El Mundo. November 23rd, 2017)  15. El \u2018co-living\u2019, la nueva moda de casa compartida se planta en Madrid  \u2018Co-living\u2019, a new shared housing trend begins in Madrid (El Mundo. November 10th, 2018)  Residential formulas such as minicasas (tiny houses) or shared housing (co-living) have become object of renewed attention in this type of discourse; both initiatives are positively conceptualized as a \"trend\" (tendencia, in Spanish) (example 16). The same is true of the proliferation of mobile applications that make it possible to obtain the leftovers from bars and restaurants at a more affordable price by using business models based on social entrepreneurship (example 17). 16. Coliving: la nueva tendencia entre emprendedores  Co-living: the new trend for entrepreneurs (El Mundo. November 21st, 2018)  17. Nueva tendencia: apps para comprar las sobras de los restaurantes New habits: apps to buy leftovers from restaurants (El Confidencial \u2013 Alimente. March 9th, 2019)  In line with mobility, the \"ideology of entrepreneurship\" (Rendueles and S\u00e1daba, 2019: 344; Santos Ortega, 2014) constitutes another of the foundational elements of neoliberal rationality and its internalization in the processes of subjectivation, much celebrated in this type of discourse. This schema is based on the deployment of a socio-affective universe, where both positive thinking (Ehrenreich, 2011) and self-induced or \"cruel\" optimism (Berlant, 2011) function as strategic elements to achieve a creative transformation and a non-conflictual internalization in the face of a changing scenario, setting class differences aside. Thus, in opposition to the shame, guilt, and individual accountability that often permeate these discourses, we find others charged with a strong affective resonance where happiness (felicidad) (example 18), pleasure (placer) (example 19), and humor (humor) (example 20) promote self-discipline and adaptation to a progressive worsening of living conditions. 18. 40 m2 de felicidad  40 square meters of happiness (El Pa\u00eds. May 23rd, 2014)  19. \u2018Nesting\u2019: el placer de no hacer nada \u2018Nesting\u2019: the pleasure of doing nothing (El Mundo \u2013 Zen. June 22nd, 2017)  20. \u00bfTreinta\u00f1eros o adolescentes? Sin casa, hijos o n\u00f3mina pero con humor Thirty-year-olds or teenagers? No home, kids or paycheck, but funny (El Pa\u00eds \u2013 BuenaVida. May 25th, 2016) This last case contrasts with the idea of a \u201cni-ni\u201d (NEETs, in English), which has been popularized over the last decade to refer to young people who neither study nor work in a stereotypical (INJUVE, 2011) and often pejorative way. Faced with the depreciation that underlies this acronym and that makes young people responsible for their condition (Garc\u00eda-Fuentes, 2019), \u201chumor\u201d acts in this example (20) as an element that mitigates the impossibility of accessing housing, a stable job, or starting a family. Its presentation as a solution or alternative is also encapsulated in these discourses and acts as a legitimizing element of the practice itself, as can be seen in the following examples. In both cases, nesting is not experienced as coercion, but rather evokes an individual and elective choice (example 21), which neutralizes guilt and relies on the positive effects on well-being (example 22). 21. Seis cosas que puedes hacer debajo de una manta  Six things you can do under a blanket (El Pa\u00eds. December 13th, 2017)  22. Una manera de quedarse el fin de semana en el sof\u00e1 y no sentirse culpable  One way to sit on the couch all weekend and not feel guilty  163 (El Pa\u00eds \u2013 BuenaVida. October 25th, 2018)  This accommodation together with the deployment of coping strategies of various kinds are seen as a learning process (example 23), whose integration into daily life celebrates dispossession, material detachment, and minimalism (example 24). These lifestyles ultimately promote adaptation towards self-imposed asceticism and the internalization of more sustainable and responsible consumption patterns. 23. Todo lo que he aprendido comiendo de la basura  Everything I\u2019ve learned by eating out of the garbage (El Pa\u00eds \u2013 Tentaciones. September 26th, 2016)  24. La tiny house: donde menos es m\u00e1s  Tiny Houses: where less is more (El Pa\u00eds \u2013 Alterconsumismo. September 5th, 2017) As can be seen in the previous examples, this new orientation \u2013 or trendinization \u2013 revises and updates the negative and stereotyped conceptualization that accompanies these discourses, endowing the precarious condition with a different, stylized meaning. The precarious experience of young people from the middle class thus becomes the locus from which inclinations, uses, or habits are promoted and called upon to configure a unique and sustainable lifestyle. This propensity for novelty and innovation (manifested in the use of neologisms with a marked presence of English), originality (with the introduction of new registers), and authenticity (through the incorporation of first-person testimonies) contributes to forming a pattern \u2013 a trend \u2013 to follow. It also provides a distinctive orientation or an alternative way of doing or performing that is presented as attractive, thus facilitating its internalization. This transformation \u2013 from public controversy to trend \u2013 operates on the basis of a discursive shift in which the deployment of this new terminology favors a new frame that popularizes and disseminates the phenomenon. This new understanding as \"fashionable\" or \"trendy\" comes to fruition within the framework of a capitalist consumer culture, revealing a journalistic trivialization of the phenomenon (D\u00edaz Nosty, 2015) that is presented as a minor issue or soft news, prioritizing novel and superficial elements at the expense of the structural causes that trigger exclusion.  4. Discussion Having analyzed the strategies and discursive resources that participate in this construction, and in line with the foundations established by CDA as a research paradigm, I consider it essential to draw our attention to the effects of this trendinization on the social order. Based on the analytical tools used in the previous section, a significant change is identified on the discursive level. This is largely articulated through a novel lexicon that, as asserted by the critical linguistic tradition (Fowler et al., 1979), allows a transformation of representations and points of view, making possible the configuration of a new system of meanings (Mart\u00edn Rojo, 1997b). This exercise therefore requires new terms that are devoid of the negative connotations that traditionally accompany the representation of precarity and poverty. This allows them to \"mean with cleanliness\" (de Santiago Guerv\u00f3s, 2016: 500) under this new trendinizing prism. The regulation of discursive practice by means of the lexical selection refers to an operation of \"verbal hygiene\" (Cameron, 1995) by which the mass media purifies some terms and expressions markedly connotative, like for example \"to eat out of the garbage,\" with the objective of minimizing their shameful effects and attenuating their conflictive dimension. Likewise, it seeks to link these phenomena with positive emotions such as happiness, pleasure, or humor, not so much to promote them, but rather to neutralize or cancel out the stigma, anxiety, or guilt that are traditionally associated with these practices. Thus, by being silenced in the media discourse through trendinization, shame loses its potential as an engine of action (Sedgwick, 2018), promoting discipline in its place.  On the basis of this linguistic change, a new interpretative frame is built, stabilized, and circulated around the processes of precarization (Serrano, Paraju\u00e1 and Zurdo, 2013), which becomes crystalized through a new frame that crosses and structures these discourses, allowing a resignification in their representations. In this way, the adaptive strategies mentioned throughout this article no longer appear as a controversial issue or a public controversy but, contrary to dominant common sense, as a trend embedded in youth lifestyles. Also contributing to this is the reconstruction of a scheme of emotions that circulates around these practices and urges precarious youth to maintain a certain class position despite the worsening of their living conditions. Media discourse thus contributes to the creation of emotional capital for these middle-class young people insofar as it dissociates shame from their bodies and identities. Instead, these practices are associated with \"high emotions,\u201d linked to fashion and consumer culture, which act as \"signs of refinement\" (Ahmed, 2015: 23).   164 Underlying this new frame is also, as Lakoff argues, a social change (2007: 4) that affects both the agency and the subjectivity of the subjects represented in line with a neoliberal rationality. Thus, by presenting this set of practices as trending, that is, as an available option, this trendinization presumes and mobilizes an act of agency. Joining a trend, which also comes with social recognition, and incorporating these practices into life habits implies a choice by which subjects are urged to act, evaluate, and decide on their own inclinations. And it does so through a process of deliberation guided by a reflective exercise that is typical of neoliberal agency (Gershon, 2011), where the pursuit of performance (Friedrich et al., 2018; Han, 2014) and cost-benefit logics acquire an unprecedented centrality. In the face of the coercion that the processes of precarization impose on youth lifestyles, trendinization is presented as a fundamentally elective issue. In other words, instead of \"drawing attention to the seriousness of the youth condition\" (Ortega and Mart\u00edn, 2012: 94), it praises and promotes a particular type of neoliberal subjectivity: that of the self-made subject, which requires sufficient courage and pride to carry out a choice in the face of the paralyzing dimension (Tejerina et al., 2012: 126) that precarity often entails. According to this paradigm, the threat of downward social mobility (Bourdieu, 1988) is experienced as a trend; that is, as a form of being self-made to the extent that this optimization is experienced as a disciplinary technique to avoid feeling like a loser in the context of a consumer society. The internalization of such style constitutes, therefore, a form of self-capitalization insofar as it favors the increase and valorization of one's human capital, which is also linked to a form of subjective well-being in which positive thinking and resilience play a key role. Both contribute to the de-dramatization and impose an affective turn that not only molds this set of practices, but also facilitates their naturalization.  5. Conclusions In conclusion, this article is a preliminary discursive approximation [6] to the question of youth in a context where, although precarity rules, it is interwoven in their lifestyles in a myriad of ways. This destabilization has been extensively addressed in the media agenda in recent years, especially in the case of digital press, where the emergence of new, ambivalent, and heterogeneous discourses no longer represents youth precarity as public controversy, but as a trend. This trendinization constitutes, therefore, one of the routes of precarity and generates a lifestyle where this condition is deconflicted and positivized, giving rise to a weak or pre-exclusive precarity. Sublimation operates on the basis of a discursive change based on four strategies: relexicalization and reframing, analyzed in this article, as well as heteroglossia and the emergence of new discursive genres. In this sense, the strategic selection of terms and the substitution of words with a greater connotative load for others promote a new frame and, along with it, a new interpretation of the phenomenon.  The fact that the practices described are conceptualized as a trend implies an adhesion on the part of the subject and thus places them in the field of personal choice. Because of their elective character, they are (re)presented as an opportunity for personal transformation and individual well-being, thus promoting a type of neoliberal-style subjectivity, one that encourages self-realization, self-construction, and self-capitalization. These strategies make it possible to circumvent the perception of personal failure and, instead, act as a technique of self-discipline. The media naturalize this precarity by deploying a new discourse that both de-problematizes them and increases their symbolic effectiveness through a socio-affective universe. This emotional dimension permeates the analyzed discourses and promotes a positive and aestheticized interpretation of them. Affective mobilization \u2013 through happiness, pleasure, humor, or resilience \u2013 links the different practices to individual well-being and also reinforces this frame of trend that links these practices to an unprecedented lifestyle. By insisting precisely on their positive character and transformative potential, this representation generates a de-stigmatization that counteracts the shame, fear, anxiety, or guilt normally associated with these destabilizing processes. It also dissociates them from phenomena such as shameful poverty by showing different ways or strategies of experiencing the modes of consumption, where enjoyment, pride, and fun define this affective experience.  6.

Since this work is a first approach to the analysis of the described discursive universe, the results shared here constitute only a section of the research, which is part of a broader ongoing project. In this sense, we maintain that media discourse participates in a more complex system of discourses that articulates this system of representations. For this reason, and in order to incur in the \"mediocentric bias\" (Valera, 2016), it becomes necessary to trace and consider a more extensive set of extramediatic influences that participate in this trendinization, make possible the emergence of these discourses and contribute to their legitimization. Hence, the need to reinforce this study with those areas of inquiry that allow to capture the complexity of the phenomenon, show the plurality of discourses that participate in this system and give voice to the social actors involved.                              \nPedro, J. & Guti\u00e9rrez-Mart\u00ednez, B.

It presents an ethnography focused on the increasing prominence of women, and it addresses different musical events, texts and artists associated with a diversity of voices, identities, discourses and emotions in the public sphere. Methodologically, we draw on participant observation, interviews, documentation and discourse analysis from a communicative and sociosemiotic perspective. We study the Spanish soul music scene, where African-descendant singers play a leading role, and we examine in depth the case of Aretha Soul Divas, a supergroup tribute to Aretha Franklin. The discourses analysed refer to the emotional dimension of musical experience, where the encounter between artists and audiences facilitates mutual understanding and emotional liberation. Furthermore, we verify the connection between the demands enunciated within the music scene, and the demands of the African descendant collective in Spain, which denounces racism and lack of visibility. The events, texts and discourses that emerge in these confluence spaces contribute to the passionate construction of a symbolic territory of their own, where the individual is combined with the collective.

Introduction This article is framed in the wider examination of the issue \u201cDiscrimination and inequality in the music industry\u201d, and it assumes the idea that a democratic system requires an open and inclusive public sphere that enables the recognition of diversity and the participation of actors and voices interested in common issues (Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn, 2017). The public sphere is understood as \u201ca space configured by communicative actions and interactions around public issues and problems\u201d (Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn, 2017: 13), and as the space where the media, citizens and public institutions come together to talk about the common world. Thus, public issues are those problems that draw public attention and provoke divergences or conflicts between different actors.  Taking inspiration from Arendt (2009), this understanding of the public sphere delves into conflict, imagination and emotions as dimensions involved in the construction of public issues (Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn, 2016). The diversity of voices is understood as an inherent aspect of a democratic public sphere, since its reality \u201crelies on the simultaneous presence of innumerable perspectives and aspects in which the common world presents itself and for which no common measurement or denominator can ever be devised\u201d (Arendt, 2009: 66). In addition, everything that goes through the public sphere undergoes a transformation, and \u201cthe most current of such transformations occurs in storytelling and (...) in artistic transposition of individual experiences\u201d (Arendt, 2009: 59). This research about female artists and music scenes is based on the analysis of sociocultural practices and discourses usually located in an underground sphere, along the margins of the public sphere, and whose development is intimately linked to textual and symbolic communication as well as with the construction of identities, discourses, emotions, values and lifestyles. The general objective is to explore the presence and importance of women artists in the African-American music scene in Spain. The article focuses on the sub-scenes formed around the blues, jazz, and soul-funk music genres, which have been historically defined for their great emotional expressiveness and performances. The study also addresses the emotional dimension of musical experience through participant observation in live music events and through the analysis of the discourses and musical practices of a selected sample of female musicians. The ethnography started with a selection of music events, texts and artists that represent an inspiring diversity of emerging voices, identities, discourses and emotions in the public sphere. Along the gender variable, the analysis addresses demographic diversity (Albornoz and Garc\u00eda Leiva, 2017), since the observed music scene brings together artists who were born in Spain and musicians who reside in Spain but have very different family, geographical, sociocultural and ethnic or racial backgrounds. Therefore, the music scene is understood as a place of encounter and dialogic interaction, which is built collectively and gradually (Bennett and Peterson, 2004; Pedro, Piquer and Val, 2018). In addition, the scene works as a stage for artists, and it may give them greater visibility in the public sphere. Consider the regular production of concerts, the constant interactions between musicians and audiences and the development of media promotion strategies. There are important conceptual similarities between the public sphere and the music scene. Just like the current public sphere (Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn, 2016), contemporary music scenes are spaces of collaboration and conflict between different actants who interact and struggle over power, recognition, appearance and visibility. Furthermore, those aspects of the public sphere that are most closely related to the stage and the performance take on special relevance and particular forms within the music scene due to the theatricality of popular music and the face-to-face, ritual encounter between musicians and audiences, where the expressed and aroused emotions are intensified. Both the public sphere and the music scene may be understood as semiospheres (Lotman, 1996: 25) \u2013meaning-making universes with different dimensions or levels. Each (sub)sphere and (sub)scene is \u201cboth a participant in the dialogue [a part of the semiosphere] as well as the space of the dialogue [an entire semiosphere]\u201d (Lotman, 1996: 25). Each one of them is distinguished by certain internal homogeneity, bounded by borders, but all of them are integrated into one same universe of broader meaning. Borders mark the separation between us and the others, as well as the reception and translation of foreign messages and texts. It is in the border and peripheral spaces where \u201caccelerated semiotic processes\u201d develop more actively, insofar the margins energise the centres and contribute to their transformation (Lotman, 1996: 15). Research on music and emotions has been mainly focused on the classification and measurement of perceived and induced emotional responses to music listening (Song, Digson, Pearce and Halpern, 2016). These perspectives have favoured studies with ad hoc experiments and quantitative and computational treatments of emotional responses, often based on classifying databases. Thus, much of these studies have neglected the social context of musical emotion, from specific situations to broader contexts (Juslin    171  and Laukka, 2004: 225). Moreover, these studies have relied on a limited conception of musical experience, which is mainly associated with individual experiences, rational knowledge and the positions of artists \u2013in contrast to the collective, physical movement and the role of aficionados (Juslin and Laukka, 2004: 226). In contrast, this study is based on an ethnographic exploration of music scenes that emphasises the key importance of contexts and pragmatic circumstances in the type of generated emotions.  The emotional dimension of musical experience is explored through observation and participation in several representative festivals of the African-American music scene in Spain, which brings together leading female artists in a novel way. The selection of this type of events, which are extraordinary to some extent, was motivated by the fact that they acquire an added importance and emotion, as well as greater media and public expectation, compared to standard performances. This exploration of the link between emotions, popular music and music scenes is based on a key idea regarding emotions: their construction and development is linked to movement, bodies, interpersonal contagion and social practices, as well as to the formation of beliefs and habits (Ahmed, 2014; Pe\u00f1amar\u00edn, 2016; Saiz Echezarreta, 2012). In contrast to spontaneous and naturalised views, this exploration conceives music emotions and scenes as ongoing constructions that develop through sociocultural practices; hence the ethnographic observation of culture in action is so appropriate. It is generally understood that those who attend a live music concert share an emotional readiness to feel the music and share a space-time of musical expression and communicative interaction. Concertgoers are willing to enjoy, get excited, loose themselves, free themselves and seek pleasure. They are willing to feel and develop emotion as a reaction throughout a series of songs and concerts, which allows them to move towards more elaborate and thoughtful feelings. Participating in a scene based primarily on live music involves feeling that scene, exposing yourself to its sounds, places, and the presence of others, to the impact of sound waves on the body, to the seduction of the show. In fact, as Arendt (2009: 60) points out with respect to the public sphere, \u201cthe presence of others who see what we see and hear what we hear assures us of the reality of the world and ourselves\u201d. The feeling of belonging developed in music scenes is common and is formed over time through the repetition and transformation of practices. It is a clear example of how participants consciously incorporate themselves into the stories, memories and imaginaries of their scene. First, we describe the employed research methods. The discussion starts with multi-sited ethnography (Marcus, 1995), which aims to recognise a multiplicity of landmarks through mobile research. More particularly, offline and online participant observation was conducted within different live music events held in 2018 and 2019. In addition, we draw on the discourses of several leading artists, which have been obtained through the examination of some of their works and through personal interviews, as well through the participation in the panel discussion \u201cMusic and Diversity\u201d (IV Dcode Lab, UCM, 08/05/2019). Furthermore, the study included the documentation in relation to musical, sound, audiovisual and journalistic texts that are representative of the blues, jazz and soul scenes, and of the media coverage regarding the selected live music events. The contextualisation section offers a descriptive and analytical discussion of the ethnographic routes conducted. Deliberately exposing the dual dimension of ethnography as method and a writing genre (Geertz, 2003; Pedro, 2014), we translated the experiences lived during the research through first-person ethnographic accounts that bring us closer to the reality of the scene, its places and the practices, discourses and emotions of those who inhabit it. In an attempt to highlight their heterogeneity and complexity, this section contains a variety of illustrative examples of the presence and participation of women artists in the Spanish African-American music scene. Then, we examine the case study of Aretha Soul Divas, an all-female band that pays tribute to Aretha Franklin, an artist with whom they share musical and political viewpoints. We introduce key information about Aretha Franklin and we explore Aretha Soul Divas\u2019 style and repertoire, as well as their links with the media. Close attention is paid to their performances and discourses, which illustrate the identity, sociocultural and political implications of musical and public performance. In the case of Astrid Jones and Juno Kotto \u2013the female artists that participated in the aforementioned panel\u2013, the discussion about music and diversity involves the affirmation and conversation about the ethnic-racial dimension associated with African-American music and with the lives of their people and performers. As black Spanish artists, Astrid and Juno articulate very significant reflections around music as an artistic, emotional and communicative expression closely linked to identity construction. Therefore, looking at the intersection between gender and race, we recognise the issue of discrimination and inequality in the 172    music industry as intimately connected with the denunciation of a broader public problem: racism, ethnic-racial discrimination and the acceptance of the African descendant population as a characteristic element of a plural country.  2. Methodology Ethnographic research in the Spanish African-American music scene was conducted in 2018 and 2019, focusing on Madrid\u2019s blues, jazz and soul-funk sub-scenes. Ethnography is a predominantly qualitative sociocultural research method based on the observation, description and interpretation of a culture or way of life. To this end, different data collection techniques were strategically and simultaneously used and intertwined: participant observation, in-depth interviews, informal in-field conversations, group conversation and documentation. Within the framework of multi-sited ethnography, focused on examining \u201cthe circulation of cultural meanings, objects and identities in a diffuse space-time\u201d (Marcus, 1995: 96), we employed the strategy \u201cfollow the music\u201d (Pedro, 2018), which requires the researcher to visit different music venues in order to track music as a form of expression and as an artistic and sociocultural event of shared experiences and emotions. In this case, the follow the music strategy was applied with a focus on the gender and ethnic-racial dimensions of the scene and the artists. Thus, the monitoring of popular music in relation to the presence of women in the Spanish African-American music scene is a point of reference to trace connections between different places, artists, audiences, media and recording productions.  On the one hand, offline and online participant observation was conducted to investigate relevant live music events celebrated in Madrid. The offline observation focused on three music festivals: Albatros Blues Festival, Ellas Crean (\u201cWomen create\u201d) and Madrid es Negro (\u201cMadrid is Black\u201d). Meanwhile, online observation was centred on the social networking site Facebook, as well as on video-sharing platforms, such as YouTube, and websites dedicated to music festivals, music venues and music dissemination.  In this ethnography, the \u201cdiffuse space-time\u201d of reference (Marcus, 1995) develops within the framework of daily production of the African-American music scene, which is built, extended and shaped by the different events that contribute to its identity and continuity. For this reason, ethnographic routes were completed jointly at the three aforementioned music festivals. First, participant observation was conducted at the sixth edition of the Albatros Blues Festival (15/09/2018), which featured five female-fronted bands. The festival was held on the outskirts of Mejorada del Campo between 2013 and 2018. Participant observation continued in the concerts of Quartetazzo and Ladies in Blues, both held on 8 March 2019 \u2013on an International Women\u2019s Day marked by important demonstrations and social movements. These concerts were part of the 2019 Ellas Crean Festival, which has been organised by the Spanish Women\u2019s Institute since 2005 in order to increase the visibility of women artists.  Another ethnographic exploration was undertaken at the premiere of the Aretha Soul Divas supergroup (03/03/2018), framed in the eighth edition of the traveling festival Madrid es Negro (2018). By supergroup we mean the occasional, extraordinary meeting of musicians who are very well-known on their own (see Welch, 2000). This is the case of Aretha Soul Divas, a high-profile line-up that brings together four experienced soul-funk singers: Astrid Jones, Juno Kotto, Shirley Davis and Mayka Edjole, accompanied by The Silverbacks (Davis\u2019s regular band). Madrid es Negro (2011) started as a celebration of the 15th anniversary of the specialised magazine Enlace Funk and Club Maderfaker (1996) \u2013two emblematic elements of the soul-funk scene\u2013 and it is held on multiple venues over the course of a month.  To complement participant observation, in-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with two music bands: Ladies in Blues and Quartetazzo. Marta D\u2019Avilas (Madrid), Patricia G\u00f6ser (Germany), Laura Solla (Pontevedra), Tatiana Firminio (Brazil) and Mariana P\u00e9rez (Bilbao), members of Ladies in Blues, were the first to be interviewed, at the rehearsal venue Ritmo y Comp\u00e1s (06/03/2019). The interview with Quartetazzo took place in front of the music school El Molino de Santa Isabel (07/03/2019) and it involved the participation of the four members: Carmen Vela (Madrid), Trinidad Jim\u00e9nez (Almer\u00eda), Emilse Barlatay (C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina) and Leticia Malvares (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). These experienced female artists, with many years participating in the scene, addressed topics of great interest such as cultural diversity, sorority, stereotypes and female visibility.  Alongside these personal interviews, first-hand accounts were obtained from two members of Aretha Soul Divas, Astrid Jones (Madrid) and Juno Kotto (Equatorial Guinea), during their participation in the panel discussion on \u201cMusic and diversity\u201d, celebrated as part of the Dcode Lab\u2019s 4th \u201cMusic industry, Media and    173  University Meeting\u201d, at the School of Information Sciences of the Complutense University of Madrid (08/05/2019). The panel discussion was moderated by Josep Pedro and Patricia Rocu, coordinator of the guide titled \u201cStrategies to incorporate the ethnic perspective at the university\u201d (2019). The guest speakers were Igor Paskual, Astrid Jones, Juno Kotto, Eduardo Rocca, Miguel Garc\u00eda, Natalia Vergara and Juan Mer\u00edn. The group discussion was of great interest, yet in this article will only refer to the interventions of Astrid Jones and Juno Kotto as members of Aretha Soul Divas and experts in the African-American music scene, based on their proven experiences and musical projects. The discourse analysis adopts a communicative and sociosemiotic approach, and it draws on different artistic and journalistic texts that are representative of the African-American music scene.   On the other hand, we completed an extensive and strategic documentation process regarding the texts produced in and about the Spanish African-American music scene, including songs, albums, concerts, promotional posters, newspaper articles, biographical profiles, interviews, discographies, plays and cultural productions. Documentation is conceived here as an active and dynamic process of continuous monitoring linked to cultural agendas, communications shared by artists, and media coverage of music events. The specific objective has been to approach the representation and participation of these social and cultural groups in the public sphere.  In this way, we mapped the African-American music scene from a perspective that was oriented to the recognition of outstanding women artists in the blues, jazz and soul-funk sub-scenes. Based on our observations, we identify a relatively short list of artists as possible case studies: Ladies in Blues, Beatriz Zaragoza, Betta Blues, Susan Santos, Suzette Moncrief, Velma Powell, Sweet Martha, Ester Wax, Big Mama Montse, Quartetazzo, T.J. Jazz, Erin Corine Johnson, Koko-Jean Davis, Maika Sitt\u00e9, Mayka Edjole, Aurora Garc\u00eda, The Pepper Pots and The Sey Sisters. It should be noted that some of the documentation regarding the African-American music scene was developed prior to the research presented in this article. Previous listening, experiences and exploratory assessments have also contributed to our perspective and knowledge about the object of study.   We also address the documentation about the African-American music scene in relation to the observation and mapping of the growing cultural production and gradual public emergency of the African descendant population in Spain. Here, it is important to remember the words of African-American writer Amiri Baraka (2002: ix-x): \u201cAs I delved into the history of music, I discovered that [telling it] was impossible without at the same time delving into the people\u2019s history. (...) That music explained history and history explained music\u201d. In particular, we refer to the documentation carried out through the review of the bibliographic, journalistic and theatrical works of important (Afro)Spanish authors, who have a remarkable relevance in the media and the community. Some works worth highlighting include the book Inapropiados e inapropiables (\u201cInappropriate and inappropriable\u201d) (Garc\u00eda, 2018), which features interviews with African and African descendant authors; the autobiographical discussion Ser mujer negra en Espa\u00f1a (\u201cBeing a black woman in Spain\u201d) by the Catalan writer Desir\u00e9 Bela-Lobede (2018), who works as blogger and columnist for the online newspaper P\u00fablico; the photobook Y t\u00fa, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 eres negro? (\u201cAnd you, why are you black?\u201d), created by Madrilenian photographer and teacher Rub\u00e9n H. Berm\u00fadez (2018); the literary works of Madrilenian journalist Luc\u00eda Asu\u00e9 Mbom\u00edo Rubio, Las que se atrevieron (\u201cThose women who dared\u201d) (2017) and Hija del camino (\u201cRoad\u2019s child\u201d) (2019); and the theatrical works written by Basque actress and director Silvia Albert Sopale: No es pa\u00eds para negras (\u201cNo country for black women\u201d) (2014) and Blackface y otras verg\u00fcenzas (\u201cBlackface and other embarrassments\u201d) (2019).   One of the followed documentation strategies was to invite Rub\u00e9n H. Berm\u00fadez and Luc\u00eda Mbom\u00edo to the seminar organised by the research group Semiotics, Communication and Culture (Complutense University of Madrid, 29/03/2019). In this seminar we were able to learn about Berm\u00fadez\u2019s perspectives regarding the development of his autobiographical work and, in general, about black identities in Spain. For her part, Mbom\u00edo talked about representations of race and gender in the media. She highlighted the permanence of certain stereotypes, the invisibilisation processes, and the limited presence of Afro-descendent people in Spanish media. To follow the debate on diversity and gender in the public sphere, we also attended the panel discussion \u201cEthnic-racial diversities from a gender equality perspective\u201d. It was moderated by Patricia Rocu and it included Luc\u00eda Mbom\u00edo, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez Corti\u00f1as (Feminist Gypsy Women\u2019s Association for Diversity), Paula Guerra C\u00e1ceres (SOS Racismo), Ana Cebri\u00e1n (Invisible Pedagogies) and Esther (Mayoko) Ortega (School of Information Sciences of the Complutense University of Madrid, 28/11/2019) as guest speakers.    174    3. Contextualisation: women artists in the blues, jazz and soul music scenes The pivotal importance of women in African-American music, specifically in blues, jazz and soul, has been clear since its origins. In fact, the first blues recordings were made by artists such as Mamie Smith, Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey, who narrated real and fictional experiences throughout their songs in the 1920s. Their ground-breaking protagonist role in the public sphere was particularly relevant in the liberation of women and in the articulation of black feminism in the early 20th century. They told stories about female identity, sexuality and social relationships. In this regard, Angela Davis (1999: 33) explains that \u201cthrough the blues, menacing problems are ferreted out from the isolated individual experience and restructured as problems shared by the community\u201d, which allows these threats to be addressed in a public context. Historically, great African-American female artists have transcended their identification with a single music genre. For example, Billie Holiday stood out for her performances in the jazz scene, but she is also recognised as a singer that embodies the blues. Nina Simone\u2019s eclecticism is identified with the different music genres she has embodied with passion and spirituality: jazz, blues, rhythm and blues, and soul. She shares vocal and instrumental virtuosity with Aretha Franklin, who will be further explored below. From gospel to soul, rhythm and blues and disco, Aretha has emerged as a central figure whose trajectory is linked to several political movements such as the African-American civil rights movement and the struggle for women\u2019s rights.  We understand the issue of discrimination and inequality within the music industry in relation to the emergence of the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement and the contemporary resurgence of feminism \u2013global turning points that raise implicit responses and sociocultural transformations in different areas of social life and the public sphere. In this regard, our observations and ethnographic explorations in Madrid indicate that since 2018 there has been a significant increase in music events dedicated to women, including the following: the continuity of the Ellas Crean Festival (2005-); the VI Albatros Blues Festival (15/09/2018); the publication of the book  Una chica sin suerte (\u201cA girl with no luck\u201d) (Sabugal, 2018), based on blues singer Big Mama Thornton; the concert series Las mujeres del blues en Madrid (\u201cWomen in blues in Madrid\u201d) (30-31/11/2018; 14/12/2019); the exhibition Damas del Blues (\u201cLadies in Blues\u201d) (03/09/2018-03/10/2018); the concert series Women in Jazz (01/10/2019); and the festival F\u00e9mina Jazz (03/10/2019-05/10/2019). These activities are the result of collaborations between associations, private initiatives and public institutions such as the Spanish Women\u2019s Institute and the Community of Madrid, which participates in the organisation of the multidisciplinary festival Ellas Crean. Also noteworthy are the concert series dedicated to women artists organised by the Madrid Blues Society with the collaboration of the Municipal Board of the District of Salamanca. The concerts of the first edition were accompanied by the presentation Las Damas del Blues, given by Montse Pratdesaba, aka Big Mama Montse, the emblematic Catalan singer and guitarist. Below, we offer two brief ethnographic stories about the VI Albatros Blues Festival, and about the concerts of Quartetazzo and Ladies in Blues held during the 8-M (Ellas Crean 2019).   3.1. VI Albatros Blues Festival Mejorada del Campo, Madrid, 15 September 2018. The weather is gentle at the end of this summer. We travel in Boni\u2019s car to Mejorada del Campo. While driving, this veteran musician of the Madrid scene talks about music bands that have marked his trajectory and, by extension, his life. He also recalls the dynamic development of record stores within the city centre. Boni is the guitarist of The Luckymakers, a blues, soul and gospel band formed in 2015 by two men and two women \u2013Patricia G\u00f6ser (vocals), J.B. Boni (guitar), Tatiana Firminio (piano) and Carlos Arsuaga (drums). The band is gender-balanced, an issue that they highlighted when performing at the Ellas Crean festival (Facebook, 08/03/2018). They are scheduled to perform later at the VI Albatros Blues Festival, which runs from two in the afternoon to about half past midnight. This edition of the Albatros Blues Festival presents five female-fronted bands: Beatriz Zaragoza Band, Rowda Backbeat & Her Shameless, Virginia Rubio Tr\u00edo, The Luckymakers, and Betta Blues Band. The festival\u2019s poster displays the event\u2019s slogan, \u201cdedicated to you, women fighters\u201d, and the image of African-American singer Billie Holiday. The event is held within an outdoor setting, where an old train carriage spreads the scent of blues musicians that travelled like hobos. This area belongs to the Western Wagon Cultural Association, created to promote and produce sociocultural activities.      175  Madrilenian singer Beatriz Zaragoza performs songs from the blues tradition such as Bobby Bland\u2019s \u201cI Don\u2019t Want No Woman\u201d (1961), which she appropriates and transforms to narrate it from a woman\u2019s perspective. This orientation defines her album Queens of Blues (2018), which is presented as \u201chumble homage\u201d to the \u201cbrave and talented artists\u201d of classic blues. In her appropriation, the artist develops a dialogic bond of the \u201cI want to be that\u201d type, based on the exploration of a differentiated other, a form of African-American music and female identity. As Jauss (1986: 33) points out, \u201copenness to another world \u2013beyond the reality of everyday life\u2013 is, also in our day, the most important step towards aesthetic experience\u201d. In the text that accompanies her album, the singer explains: From the moment I listened to Big Mama Thornton, she caught me deeply. What a voice! What an energetic yet sweet way of singing... The more I listened to her, the more I liked her and wanted to meet more female classic blues artists. (...) Alberta Hunter, Ida Cox, Memphis Minnie, etc. As a woman, I connected with those intense and sincere lyrics that expressed their longings, their miseries, their truth in that difficult time that they had to live (Zaragoza, 2018).  Her discourse shows how music appropriation entails an affective and intimate dimension, which is nonetheless connected to certain sociocultural groups. Her testimony illustrates how these processes are marked by continuous emotional journeys from the primary affection of initial listening, to the collective emotion of exploring the history of popular music, sharing it, and performing it in front of others. This gives rise to the intense emotions that accompany the dialogic connection experienced by a singer of our time regarding women artists from another era. Finally, we identify an elaborate, conscious and thoughtful feeling of belonging within contemporary music scenes.    3.2. International Working Women\u2019s Day Madrid, 8 March 2019. The lights of Caf\u00e9 Berlin go out at the start of the show. Marked by an old theatre atmosphere, this venue hosts two musical performances that are part of Ellas Crean festival. Quartetazzo and Ladies in Blues put the final touch to a day in which many women have fought for their rights. Both groups celebrate women\u2019s prominence in music, and they reflect on the importance of giving them a greater visibility during a day, the 8th of March, which has become a symbol of social struggle, equality and freedom. Quartetazzo is a jazz flute quartet formed in 2017 by instrumentalists Carmen Vela (C flute), Leticia Malvares (G and C flutes), Trinidad Jim\u00e9nez (bass flute and C flute) and Emilse Barlatay (C flute). Originally launched in 2016, Ladies in Blues is a blues supergroup formed by Marta D\u2019\u00c1vilas (vocals), Patricia G\u00f6ser (vocals), Laura G\u00f3mez Palma (bass), Tatiana Firminio (piano), Laura Solla (guitar) and Mariana P\u00e9rez (drums) [1]. The stage presence of the flute quartet is surprising, as it is not common for flutes to be the almost absolute protagonists. Jazz music was the starting point for these artists, who looked to develop their own eclectic and innovative sound by integrating swing, blues, flamenco, chacarera, forr\u00f3 and other forms of roots music. Quartetazzo\u2019s motto, \u201cfour women, three nationalities, a sea of styles\u201d, emphasises diversity in terms of gender, nationality and style. In a creative exercise of intercultural encounter and dialogue, these artists develop their shared identities and experiences during their performances, which are open to improvisation.  Carmen Vela describes the experience of playing with her companions as \u201ca stronghold of peace\u201d, highlighting mutual understanding, shared leadership, teamwork, and rapport (personal interview, 07/03/2019). Together, they project an affective disposition of cheerful positivity and intercultural encounter, present in their discourses and images. Carmen summarised this union of strength and safety through the train analogy: Nobody has to inform or remind anyone, because we\u2019re all here. We are a train. And of course, as we are also used to pulling the wagon from other places, now we see ourselves as four engine drivers in the same train. Just imagine it (personal interview, 07/03/2019).  Towards the end of the concert, Brazilian flamenco dancers Lisi Sfair Denardi and Gabriel Mat\u00edas delight the audience with several unexpected appearances. Placed at the centre of the semi-circle of flutes, the bailaores establish a curious and surprising communion with the flutists. Their flamenco passion enhances a show marked by movement, nuances and contrasts. Their heels contrast and connect with the soft and high-pitched sounds of the flutes. We experience an emotional journey driven by the flute players; by the whisperings, screams and blows of Quartetazzo.  176     23 hours. An explosion of dance energy is transmitted to the public as the Ladies in Blues burst into the stage. With a cheerful and relaxed eclecticism that replicates more purist approaches to the genre, the Ladies form a plural, experienced and talented group. This urban blues sextet combines electric blues, rhythm and blues, soul and funk. Accordingly, throughout the concert they perform songs associated with well-known female blues musicians: Koko Taylor, Ruth Brown, Etta James, Sugar Pie Desanto and Katie Webster, as well as covers of blues, jazz and soul classics.  Developed in close collaboration with Caf\u00e9 Berlin and producer Jorge Biancotti (former president of the Madrid Blues Society), this meeting of female musicians pays tribute to legendary artists while promoting the visibility of current female artists. Their performance during 8-M has received outstanding coverage in specialised news media outlets such as Madrid en Vivo magazine (2019), where they appear on the cover. On this occasion, the Ladies are joined on stage by Argentinean artist Marina Sor\u00edn, who plays the phonofiddle, an atypical stringed musical instrument that contrasts with the urban sextet during the performance of \u201cCatfish Blues\u201d. The seemingly improvised encounter prompts the passionate applause of the audience, and it is the result of the constant mobility and interaction between musicians from different generations and geographical backgrounds. They intertwine their voices and immerse themselves into the cultural tradition of the blues, making it clear that they are ready to follow their own path.  Singer Marta D\u2019Avilas referred to the idea of women empowerment in relation to music: \u201cWhen a woman is on stage, she has to empower those who are below it\u201d (personal interview, 06/03/2019). The connection and the bond between musicians and their audiences is based on musical discourse and performance, on sharing the encouragement to undertake, get up, take control, and step forward. According to her discourse: \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018I\u2019m here and, if you want to, you can be here too\u2019\u201d.    4. Analysis: from Aretha Franklin to Aretha Soul Divas Soul is a music genre that literally means \u201csoul\u201d. Historically, it was the main soundtrack of the African-American civil rights movement (Guralnick, 2002). Artistically, it is defined by its expressive intensity, passionate performance and implications of sincerity and authenticity (Le Gendre, 2012). Dancing and performance, often dramatic, as well as emphatic rhythmic repetition and the use of screaming and crying in songs are also key to the genre. Consider, for example, James Brown\u2019s rendition of \u201cPlease, Please, Please\u201d. In his heartfelt narration, renowned music journalist Luis Lapuente (2018: 13) summarises the emotional and sentimental implications of this genre when he says that \u201csoul returns again and again because no other music is more breath-taking, or more genuinely anchored in the corner of emotions\u201d. He refers to the characteristic richness and contrasts of what he calls the \u201cemotional map of soul\u201d. Our case study is the supergroup Aretha Soul Divas, and it features four singers who also perform independently with their own bands: Astrid Jones (Astrid Jones & The Blue Flaps); Juno Kotto (Juno & Darrell); Mayka Edjole (The Sweet Vandals); and Shirley Davis (Shirley Davis & The Silverbacks). First, we propose a necessary biographic and contextual approach to Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul to whom this band pays tribute. As we will see, there are multiple connections between Aretha Franklin and Aretha Soul Divas, which go beyond the music they share. Frequently, their social justice demands are intertwined, while the tradition of Black Power and the notion of diversity converge as sociopolitical dimensions that intersect with their art in different geographical and historical contexts.    4.1. Aretha Franklin: an icon of the civil rights movement and feminism Aretha Franklin began her music career as a gospel singer in the church choir where her father, Clarence LeVaughn Franklin, was a minister. In 1961, she embarked on a secular-music career through soul music. She was also actively involved in the civil rights movement in the United States of America. Aretha Franklin identified with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, co-founded by Martin Luther King Jr., who was a colleague of her father. In an interview (Day & Night, 2014), Aretha Franklin stated that her life was changed by the civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King. She recalled the car tours she took in her childhood, when they could not stop at certain restaurants due to \u201cracial\u201d segregation. After the    177  assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968, Franklin performed at the memorial service to honour his memory.  In 1967, Aretha Franklin popularised Otis Redding\u2019s song \u201cRespect\u201d. Her appropriation and resignification of this song, rearticulated from a female perspective, turned \u201cRespect\u201d and herself into feminist anthems and icons, respectively. While the original version of the song is about \u201ca plea from a desperate man towards a woman\u201d (Jackson, 2006: 229), Aretha\u2019s version reached a much higher impact and is considered a \u201csuffocating cry for freedom\u201d (Guralnick, 2002: 332). When presenting the song at the Monterrey Festival (1967), Otis openly dealt with the issue and casually explained: \u201c[Respect] is a song that a girl took away from me. A good friend of mine, this girl, she just took the song, but I\u2019m still going to do it anyway\u201d. In Otis\u2019s version of the song, he asks for respect when he gets home. In a more or less explicit way, the narrator addresses his partner, telling her that he wants to maintain appearances, simulating a sort of marital loyalty, which he does not actually find at home.  Do me wrong, honey, if you wanna You can do me wrong, honey, while I\u2019m gone But all I\u2019m askin\u2019 is for a little respect when I come home (\u201cRespect\u201d, Otis Redding, 1965)   Aretha changes some of the song\u2019s lyrics and interpretation. Her version constitutes a response in the conversation, delivered through African-American music. Thus she replies that she does not want to hurt him and that she is not lying to him either.  I ain\u2019t gonna do you wrong while you\u2019re gone Ain\u2019t gonna do you wrong \u2018cause I don\u2019t wanna All I\u2019m askin\u2019 is for a little respect when you come home (\u201cRespect\u201d, Aretha Franklin, 1967)   The fact that, as a woman, she asks her partner for respect turned this song into a feminist anthem of that era. Aretha insists on respect by repeatedly spelling the word and by placing it at the centre of the song much more explicitly. She challenges the listener over and over again. The singer translates and resignifies \u201cRespect\u201d, and the song acquires new meanings linked to other identities, discourses and emotions. R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what it means to me (\u201cRespect\u201d, Aretha Franklin, 1967)   The prominence of the choir in Aretha\u2019s version of the song stimulates emotions of unity and strength, which are in sync with the call and response dialogic interactions that are established between different voices. Gilroy (1999: 78) points out that call and response constitutes a democratic and community moment \u201cthat symbolises and anticipates (but does not guarantee) new or non-dominant social relationships\u201d. Historically, the energetic demand for \u201cRespect\u201d is framed within the context of the claims and demands of the American second-wave feminism, developed in the 1960s and 1970s. While there were limits and tensions, in the development of this wave there were alliances with political movements in favour of the rights for African Americans (Thornham, 2010).  In 1970, Aretha Franklin performed at the Spanish Song Festival at Benidorm (Godes, 2018). In his chronicle, journalist \u00c1ngel Casas (1970) described the concert as one \u201cof the greatest attractions of the festival\u201d, since Aretha\u2019s presence alone \u201cjustified attendance to the event\u201d. However, as Casas explained, while many foreigners were attracted by Aretha, \u201ca large share of the Spanish public (...) left their seats during the performance of the American soul star\u201d. This is indicative of the divergence between different audiences in terms of tastes and interests. In addition, the singer was featured in one of the covers of Mundo Joven magazine (1970), where she was introduced in relation to her ethnic-racial identity and geographical origin: \u201cIn Spain Aretha Franklin. \u2018Nationality: Black-American\u2019\u201d.   178    4.2. Aretha Soul Divas and the Queen of Soul: connections beyond music Aretha Soul Divas\u2019 performances in the music venue But (Madrid) coincide over time with important events in Aretha Franklin\u2019s life. This may be a strategic response in cultural production, which seeks to maximise the possibilities of appearance and visibility in the media, the music scene, and the public sphere. The band\u2019s first performance took place in the eighth edition of the Madrid es Negro festival (03/03/2018), once Aretha had definitively retired from the spotlight. As the news of her retirement spread, renowned music critic Diego Manrique (2017) referred to Aretha as \u201cthe greatest survivor of that golden age of black music\u201d and claimed that this farewell was \u201ca bitter pill to swallow\u201d for the Queen of Soul.  A few months after the death of the artist, which was covered by many mainstream and specialised media (Mars, 2018; Scarpellini, 2018), Aretha Soul Divas performed again as a tribute that anticipated the ninth edition of the Madrid es Negro festival (16/11/2018). Later, in October 2019, the band offered a new concert in Madrid as part of the Women in Jazz series, which coincided with the Spanish premiere of the long-awaited Amazing Grace documentary (Elliott and Pollack, 2018). Two members of Aretha Soul Divas, Astrid Jones and Mayka Edjole, were interviewed for a television news report in La Sexta TV, dedicated to the Women in Jazz series, and the newspaper ABC highlighted their performance in the series. These events illustrate the access of Aretha Soul Divas to the central or mainstream public sphere.    4.2.1. The songs Aretha Soul Divas\u2019 repertoire includes songs recorded by Aretha Franklin during the late 1960s and early 1970s: \u201cRespect\u201d (1967), \u201cI Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You)\u201d (1967), \u201cDo Right Woman, Do Right Man\u201d (1967), \u201c(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\u201d (1967), \u201cThink\u201d (1968), \u201cI Say a Little Prayer\u201d (1968), \u201cThat\u2019s All I Want From You\u201d (1970) and \u201cRock Steady\u201d (1972). These songs were released during a crucial period in Aretha\u2019s career, given that when she signed with Atlantic Records in 1967 she left behind the polished \u201cto perfection\u201d sounds of her sessions with Columbia to embrace the greater modernity and expressiveness of soul linked to funk (Jackson, 2006: 228). In terms of content, the identified songs are characterised by the frequent interrelationship and confusion between two main thematic dimensions in popular music: love or relationships, and social, cultural and political demands. As mentioned, \u201cRespect\u201d is one of the main hits performed by Aretha Soul Divas. Aretha\u2019s original recording is included in the same album as \u201cI Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\u201d and \u201cDo Right Woman, Do Right Man\u201d (1967). The three songs are about love and relationships. In fact, in \u201cDo Right Woman, Do Right Man\u201d Aretha conveys a call for respect similar to that in \u201cRespect\u201d.  For its part, the song \u201c(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\u201d (Lady Soul, 1970) centres on relationships and offers a first-person account of a woman in love. \u201cI Say a Little Prayer\u201d and \u201cThink\u201d, two great hits included in Aretha Now (1968), follow the same thematic direction. The first one is a love declaration dedicated to an absent character. The second one, connected to \u201cRespect\u201d, has also established itself as a feminist anthem that situates reflection, thought and freedom as central value objects. In this sense, the emphatic repetition of the word \u201cfreedom\u201d, proclaimed in crescendo by the singers and the band during the performance, is outstanding. Throughout their performances, the Aretha Soul Divas singers fluently perform several roles. They are in constant interaction and alternate their positions based on the song performed. On the one hand, they are part of the choir \u2013the collective voice that, together with the instrumentalists, accompanies, protects, enhances and stimulates the lead singer, the band and the public. On the other hand, each of the four singers \u2013Astrid Jones, Juno Kotto, Shirley Davis and Mayka Edjole\u2013 also acts as the main frontwoman of the line-up. In contrast to musical, sociocultural, and poetic approaches focused on individual figures as strong and immovable stars or leaders, this type of group interpretation fosters the relationship of interdependence between the individual voice and the collective voice. Thus, in a broader sense, we also recognise an expressive and artistic manifestation of the idea of the individual as an inter-dependent (Berlant, 2011; 1998), which replicates its understanding as an autonomous and self-sufficient figure. The collective voice can only be constructed from the combination of different individual voices, while the individual voice tends to develop fully in the dialogic context of polyphonic interpretation (see Bajt\u00edn, 1989; Monson, 2009; Pedro, 2018).       179  4.2.2. Astrid Jones and Juno Kotto: discourses on music and diversity At the panel discussion about music and communication (Dcode Lab, 08/05/2019), we explored the relationships between music and diversity with a group of experts on musical performance, the music industry and cultural associations. Primarily identified with soul as a broad genre in contact with rhythm and blues, jazz, reggae and electronic music, singers Astrid Jones and Juno Kotto promoted a complex and multidimensional understanding of popular music, capable of integrating entertainment, education, political activism and healing.  In her first intervention, when asked \u201cwhat are we talking about when we talk about diversity?\u201d, Juno reflected on her identity based on a marked duality expressed in national (Guinean-Spanish) and ethnic-racial (black) terms: \u201cI come here as a Guinean, a descendant of Guineans, but also as a Spaniard [...] Because, well, I am black, I am Guinean, but I am Spanish\u201d (panel discussion, 08/05/2019). Juno remarks that \u201cdiversity is not only what comes from outside, it is not the other, the one different from me, but what is already here\u201d. This suggests that we are also the others, and it seeks to normalise Spanish blackness. In addition, the artist emphatically stresses the cultural and ethnic-racial diversity that actually exists in Spain, both in social and musical terms: \u201cI live here, I work here... and the diversity that exists in Spain is already very large. It exists! (...) Not just in people, but in music. For me, diversity is rather the variety within a reality\u201d (Ibid.). In this way, she positively questions and invites the public to participate in music and intercultural encounter associated with live music performance.  Similarly, Astrid emphasised her desire for people to discover music and cultures through everyday experience: \u201cIt is interesting that we learn to discover the living music that exists in the places where we live\u201d (Ibid.). Like Juno, Astrid also referred to her Guinean family origins (\u201cmy parents are from Equatorial Guinea\u201d). She is a Spanish singer from Equatorial Guinean origin, specialised in African-American music, and she represents the diversity associated to hybridisation between different traditions that we find both outside and within our borders. In Astrid\u2019s words: \u201cI am a Spanish singer of African origin, who sings African-American music, who loves salsa, and that is diversity in itself. That richness exists\u201d (Ibid.). Astrid and Juno\u2019s emphasis on the existence of musical, cultural and ethnic-racial diversity in Spain also represents a response to the general lack of recognition, discrimination and inequality.  Also outstanding is the recognition and explicit affirmation that both artists make regarding the identity, sociocultural and political implications of musical and public performance. Juno highlighted the political character of image and performance: \u201cIf you are a woman you can choose to wear heels and make up, but you can also decide not to do it due to a political reason, an activist motivation\u201d (Ibid.). In addition, she poses a historical reflection on the expression and representation of emotions in African-American music.  Music is an absolute means to transmit messages of vindication. If we look at African-African music in the forties, fifties and sixties, it tended to project a very clownish image of the black population. Everyone was always smiling a lot, wearing wigs to hide their natural hair... In the wake of the fight for civil rights, as early as the sixties and seventies, people began to strip off those costumes and show their bodies more. In the 1990s, there was a wave of artists, including Erykah Badu, who ceased to smile in concerts. She no longer danced or made striking gestures as a kind of vindication: \u201cwe can be serious artists and we do not have to be ridiculed\u201d (Juno Kotto, panel discussion, 08/05/2019). While certain smiling and cheerful expressions were associated with servitude and buffoonery in the media and the music industry, serious and even challenging attitudes were developed as political responses linked to gestures and attitudes that are often understood as representative of the collective. As for Astrid, she acknowledges that her position as a singer gives her certain power to communicate, which she uses to act as a spokesperson and to give greater visibility to identities and voices of African descent.  Being on stage gives you the power to communicate, (...) to empathise. The power to be able to say certain things, open people\u2019s eyes, share knowledge about a reality, give visibility. I do feel a little bit of \u201cresponsibility\u201d and partly the need to communicate certain things incorporated into the music (Astrid Jones, panel discussion, 08/05/2019).  In her multidimensional view, she also referred to music as \u201ca healing process\u201d for artists and their publics. 180    For me, music means many things. I see it as a healing process for both the performer and the audience. I think it is also a mechanism for communication, vindication and activism, beyond the fun and well-being that it can provide. In my case, I believe art is rebellion, fight, and all these things apart from the industry (Astrid Jones, panel discussion, 08/05/2019). We understand this process of communicative interaction as an opportunity for participants to express and free themselves emotionally, moving towards the intimate connection of shared musical experience. It was precisely through her artistic experience, this time as a theatre actress in the play \u201cAn Invisible Piece of This World\u201d (Peris-Mencheta, 2012), that Astrid discovered in greater depth the problem of Immigration Detention Centres. Her approach to associations advocating for the closure of these centres and her involvement in artistic performance marked a turning point in her awareness.  Exploring the intersection between gender and \u201crace,\u201d we recognise the issue of discrimination and inequality in the music industry as intimately connected to the denunciation of a broader public problem: the denunciation of systemic racism and ethnic-racial discrimination, and the acceptance of the African descendant population as an own element of a plural country. In Spain, the African descendant population responds to the public problem of racism and discrimination in different ways. We highlight two key dimensions that are intertwined but have their own unique singularities. On the one hand, the multiple and constant work of denouncing racism, which involves collective organisation in associations such as SOS Racismo, the Madrid Union of Street Vendors (commonly known as manteros), the Barcelona\u2019s Popular Union of Ambulant Sellers, and Afrof\u00e9minas (\u201cAfro-women\u201d). These organisations have articulated specific demands regarding laws, state policies and police actions, including the closure of Immigration Detention Centres; the end of discriminatory police profiling; the denunciation of racist assaults; and the creation of an African descendant culture institute in Spain.  On the other hand, we observe the action of collective self-affirmation practiced by the African descendant collective in Spain through the construction of a symbolic territory of their own. It appears full of inspiring and thoughtful artistic texts that challenge stigma and build a strong sense of belonging to a valuable collective, which is manifested through shared experience, emotion, music and the strength to keep walking day to day. In addition to music, we find artistic manifestations in different cultural fields, such as photography, literature and theatre, which reflect on Afro-Spanish identity based on a process of self-interrogation, public exposure and artistic discourse.  For example, through theatre, Silvia Albert Sopale created and performed the play Blackface y otras verg\u00fcenzas (\u201cBlackface and other embarrassments\u201d) (2019), which addresses different traditions and celebrations with racist components. From a critical perspective, the author stages racist celebrations, characters and events, such as the Three Kings day parade in Alcoi (Alicante), La Negra Tomasa, Sara Baartman, and el Bosquimano de Ba\u00f1olas (\u201cthe Negro of Banyoles\u201d). Through these cases, the artist challenges the image of the African descendant population that is conveyed to society, as well as the cultural imaginary they perpetuate. An important part of the performance is focused on reflection and criticism around the practice of blackface and the use of blackness as a costume. At one point in the play, Silvia Albert Sopale puts herself in Baartman\u2019s shoes, the so-called \u201cHottentot Venus\u201d, and she asks for the company and embrace of a black woman present in the audience. This results in an emotionally intense encounter that provokes the applause of the audience.  In the practice of blackface, of using black make-up and large red lips in traditional festivities, parties and carnivals, we explicitly appreciate the emergence of a public controversy between two opposing sides. The African descendant community denounces it as offensive because of the history, ridicule and infantilisation associated with this aesthetic, which perpetuates a stereotypical image of black people. For example, Afrof\u00e9minas (2020) has repeatedly denounced the massive blackface staged in the Three Kings parade in Alcoi, and they have also requested the government to stop considering it a Cultural Interest Asset. On the other hand, advocates of these practices are offended by accusations of racism. They tend to see it as a tribute, as a fun activity or a prize linked to a tradition. The City Council of Alcoi, a strong defender of the traditional parade, has ignored these criticisms (Mart\u00ednez, 2020). For its part, the Spanish Socialist Worker's Party (PSOE) from Alcoi filed a motion in favour of this celebration in 2017, expressing its opposition to the accusations of racism (El Mundo, 2017). We find a double manifestation: on the one hand, the feeling of being an object of mockery and, on the other, the temporal and caricaturised game of identification with the other.       181  5. Conclusions This paper has addressed the issue of women in music through ethnographic research focused on the exploration of cultural, ethnic-racial and gender diversity. Using the \u201cFollow the music\u201d strategy, we have identified different female-fronted music groups, as well as events and albums dedicated to their contributions. Overall, we have noticed a growing prominence of women artists in the African-American music scene, which also emerges from collaboration with their male counterparts. In these alliances, the unconventional and often misunderstood lifestyle of local musicians tends to become an element of union and cohesion between diverse peers with common practices.  The discourses of the protagonists point towards the decisive emotional dimension of musical experience. It is characterised by the communicative interaction between artists and audiences, speakers and listeners who coincide or not in space and time, and this sociocultural encounter facilitates emotional liberation and potential personal healing. They present examples of female cooperation, solidarity, diversity, inspiration and empowerment, and they illustrate the ways in which popular music and glocal music scenes stimulate intercultural and intergenerational dialogue (see Robertson, 1994; Pedro, 2018). In addition, the analysis of the verbal, visual and musical discourses of the selected artists has revealed significant value objects related to ideals such as respect and freedom.  African descendant female singers play a leading role in the Spanish soul scene. They tend to establish dialogic and emotional bonds with the tradition, and they develop works and discourses with clear political implications. In this way, we can appreciate the connection between the demands made within the music scene and industry, and the emergence of the African descendant movement in Spain, which denounces racism and the lack of visibility as wider public problems. African descendant female artists publicly articulate anti-racist and pro-diversity demands, drawing on their personal and artistic experiences. Thus, the socio political discourses that are articulated maintain a relationship of continuity with the Black Power and black feminism movements, historically linked to soul music. Their discourses seek to strengthen intragroup relations through the construction of their own symbolic territory, where the individual is combined with the collective.  Through a movement that transcends national borders and supports a broader ethnic-racial bond, the African descendant community seeks to push the boundaries of the traditional definition of nation from the margins (Stanfield, 2005; Herbst, 1994). In contrast with the same tiresome and uncomfortable questions about their origins and ethnic-racial traits, the construction of an Afro-Spanish symbolic territory seeks to shape a shared space of expression, freedom and recognition. Far from assuming a position of victimhood, the proposals of the African descendant community mainly insist on identity exploration, on the emotional path travelled so far, and on the construction of meaning about their experiences as African descendants. They mainly arouse empathy, identification, mutual support, strength and empowerment.  Due to its communicative, sociocultural and artistic dimension, we understand that music is a field that is especially suitable for the expression and analysis of discourses and emotions characterised by multiple interpersonal and intercultural connections and associations. As Turino explains (2008: 18), musical performance is capable of bringing people together by blurring multiple differences between participants, and by creating a sense of collective action and consciousness that emphasises the common, the similarities of role, space-time, sensitivity and purpose.   6.

In particular, 2824 tweets from the official accounts of the 13 political parties represented in the Congress of Deputies were extracted and analysed. The methodology applied compositional data analysis and its visualisation employing Biplot (a visualisation tool that enables contrasting the relative importance of the elements under study). Unlike traditional approaches, this study emphasises the relative importance of the issues within the agenda while incorporating a third category, the sentiment analysis. The main findings concern the reliability of the method to represent compositionally the agenda and the agenda-setters, as well as the sentiment analysis. This confirms that the issues most notably associated with certain parties also reflect their projection on sentiment. In sum, this analysis sheds light on sentiment representation in the agenda-setters (attribute agenda), especially in the field of political communication.

Introduction The last decade was a testimony of the consolidation of social networks as an important channel through which the political leaders convey their discourses, making them more accessible to their potential voters (Golbeck et al., 2010; Conway et al., 2015; Graham et al., 2016). The professionalization of political discourse in the networks was not only meant as another form of political communication capable of influencing the social sphere, but also, at the same time, it has proven its capacity to influence the political and media agenda. Within this media-social ecosystem, Twitter was established as one of the main political spaces of spreading information to a growing audience (Conway et al., 2015), appearing as a reference platform in order to gather information, efficiently connect with potential voters and follow the activity of the sources (Parmelee, 2013). In this way, Twitter claims to be the standardised tool by which connections among parties, journalists and audiences are established, especially during the election campaign processes (Jungherr, 2016), thus being an important channel to measure the reactions of the public opinion on behalf of the political action. For this reason, the inherent interactivity of the platform has significantly fostered the exposition of citizens in the political discussion and the ideological confrontation (Guo et al., 2016). Twitter has been established as one of the most important global platforms in terms of its immediacy in diffusing information among the society (Yousuf Al-Aama, 2015). The most outstanding socio-political events of the last years like the Egyptian revolution in 2011, the election of Trump, the referendum for peace in Colombia, Brexit, or the most recent movements like #MeToo or #FridaysForFuture, constitute a current evidence. The new dynamics in the relation among the media and the audiences propose a greater pluralism in the media sphere, carrying the traditional model of political communication through an unprecedented transformation of the interaction among their principal agents. All of this is part of a systemic reformulation process of the dynamics of power and influence, where the message is not transferred to the public unidirectionally from the traditional, but it is understood as a construct which is fed and developed through the horizontal and convergent interaction of the various actors and platforms (Scolari et al., 2019). So much so, that in the last decade, from the academy, the investigation in the field of political, media and public agendas has been especially focused in the study of digital media as new spaces to influence the construction of the contents that are dealt within (Meraz, 2009).  During the second quarter of 2018, the Twitter platform registered 338 million profiles worldwide and 4.9 million in Spain. Their users published an average of 500 million tweets per day in the whole world (Statistic Brain, 2018). Moreover, it is significant that the number of active users on Twitter exceeds 22% of internet users in the world (Kayser and Bierwisch, 2016). These statistics reflect the global spread of this social network and its potential impact. Besides having a global coverage of the main daily issues, it provides a space that allows to share opinions easily, using various content resources, including text, images, and links, in contrast to many other social media platforms. It also provides almost real-time access to the posts through the API, boosting it as an efficient platform to contrast large scale states of opinion almost in real time. In this sense, we decided to focus on Twitter as the main source of data, among other social networks, in order to carry out the analysis proposed in the study.  In this context, the emotional dimension of a political discussion in the social media turns out to be of particular importance, since an emotional debate on a controversial issue often develops in a more dynamic and unpredictable way than an objective discussion (Ku\u0161en et al., 2017). Thematic analysis methods have contributed to classifying and comprehending the emerging interests among the public on the basis of the various agendas. However, the complexity of the studies referring to the dynamics of emission-reception make the analysis of the generated sentiments in these discursive actions a difficult task (Fan and Gordon, 2014). This is why case studies about real-world political events are of particular interest, since they contribute to the understanding of human behaviour, to detecting patterns and to identifying generic approaches in order to analyse the behaviour of the actors involved in managing the on-line social networks (see, for example, Ahmadian et al., 2017; or Ferrer-Rosell et al., 2019, 2020b).  The sentiment analysis on Twitter has been used in a wide spectrum of areas related with governance and public trust, that range from the prediction of resentment against the government politics to the prediction of general elections\u2019 results (Tumasjan et al., 2010; Calderon et al., 2015). This emerging field aims to comprehend and predict such behaviour, and even though this area of study is still evolving and generates a lot of enthusiasm, there is a constant debate about the effectiveness of the use of sentiment analysis on Twitter to predict elections and other events of the real-world.  Regarding research on the use of Twitter in the political agenda, scholars have been initially interested in the way in which the platform influences in determining the creation of such thematic agenda for the main communication media (Jungherr, 2014; Wallsten, 2014), but it has gone far beyond that (Calvo and Aruguete, 2020). The analysis has also centred the interest of researchers in the study of the second level agenda (or attribute agenda), where the objective is to decipher the given focus on the subject, which  187 relates undoubtably with sentiment analysis. A recent example is that of Lee and Xu (2018). Another field of study is that of dynamic relations among agendas (Neuman et al., 2014). In the same way, by the method of social networks analysis, it has been studied what has arrived to be termed third level agenda, in which the associations between perceived themes for different audiences have been revealed (Guo and Vargo, 2015).  From the beginning of the study of the agenda-setting theory it is supported that certain media or social agents rise, or intend to rise, as mediators of information, in an praxis based on including or emitting certain themes in a scenario of content hierarchy (McCombs and Shaw, 1972; McCombs, 2004). As a result, the relations between those that we can call agenda-setters, or at least they pretend to be, and the contents (themes on the agenda), were traditionally studied from a descriptive standpoint, by counting repetition frequencies of a theme, or through the Spearman correlations, where only the order in the theme\u2019s ranking is registered and any other kind of information is omitted. Unfortunately, the traditional methods of analysis mentioned above do not actually centre the analysis on the relative importance of the themes of the agenda, nor do they provide visualisation tools. To resolve this limitation, in the last years work has begun with the application of compositional data analysis (CoDa) in the field of political communication (see Blasco-Duatis et al., 2018a, 2018b, 2018c, 2019). CoDa is the standard statistical methodology which is applied when the researcher is interested in the relative importance of the parts of a whole (Aitchison, 1986).  In our research, we focus especially on a well-known data visualisation tool, the compositional biplot, that allows us to see which themes are prioritised by which political parties (that act or try to act as agenda-setters when they use their Twitter accounts), which topics change their presence proportionally, and which parties have a similar behaviour according to the themes, having in mind that what is important does not reside in the volume of information but in the relative weight of each theme for each party.  The innovative contribution of this article lies in posing a visualisation of compositional data that allows the attribute agenda to be represented, including the themes suggested by the political parties and the sentiments linked with the published messages on Twitter. In the first place, we employ the tool \u201cTweet Binder\u201d to capture the published tweets through the official accounts of the political parties in study. Next, we apply a methodology based on content analysis to detect, on one hand, the themes that form the agenda and, in a second phase, the sentiments derived from the semantic and contextual constructions of those tweets. This serves in applying, in a third phase, a new type of compositional biplot which permits us to deal with more than one composition at the same time (Ferrer-Rosell et al., 2020c; Filzmoser et al., 2018; Kyn\u010dlov\u00e1 et al., 2016), where the focus lies in the proportions among the various themes of the agenda, sentiments, the relative importance of both for the agenda-setters and the relation between themes and sentiments. In sum, in this article we not only provide a compositional study of the agenda and the agenda-setters in Twitter (a theme that has been already been developed in the seminal work of Blasco-Duatis et al., 2019) but we extend the compositional analysis in a second level, the sentiment analysis, which carries a value, from what we modestly know, that has not been explored so far in a compositional way in the field of political communication. We specifically compile and analyse 2824 tweets from the 13 political formations represented in Spanish Deputy Congress in 2018. We gather a data set of thematic character, of the transmission and information about the sentiments of the agenda-setters, that are expressed within the content of the messages. The rest of this work is structured in a section presenting the methodology, which is divided in two sub-sections consisting of a first process of codification-categorisation, and a second one of compositional visualisation of the data. Further on, the results over the sentiment analysis of the agenda on Twitter by the political parties in the context of the no confidence motion to the government in 2018, will be presented.   2. Methodology The methodological proposal that we present constitutes a novel contribution in the field of sentiment analysis of political communication, since it applies the analysis and visualisation of compositional data in a study that, along with representing the mapping of the agenda, incorporates a third element, the sentiment analysis (attribute agenda). The method is developed in a first phase through the content analysis of the set of themes processed during the motion of no confidence to the government in 2018 by the main Spanish political parties on Twitter (first level agenda), and the sentiment codification derived from the semantic constructions of each tweet (second level agenda). In a second stage, and since the quantity is not comparable because the number of tweets and analysed sentiments is different in each party, we are interested in relative measurements. What is actually important in this assumption is the  188 appearance percentage of a theme of the agenda or sentiment (category) in each political party (or agenda-setter), as well as the relations among them. In the literature this compositional approach is used to analyse data that entail relative information, when the focus lies in the proportions between the different vectors-categories, or themes of the agenda and sentiments, and their agenda-setters or political parties (Aitchison, 1986).  2.1. Selection and codification of the tweets  There is a common affirmation in the field of sentiment analysis, that successful results depend, to a large degree, on the specific development that has been used to gather the set of data to be studied. In this sense, most of the methodological approaches in this field employ systems based on supervised techniques of automatic and statistical learning. Even though they have proven to be quite successful in the past-and not only in the field of sentiment analysis, but also in the majority of text extraction and information retrieval applications- their obvious disadvantage, in terms of functionality, is their limited applicability in domains of data different from those they were designed for (Pang and Lee, 2004). Also, the codification of sentiments requires a system that provides a measurement of the semantic orientation of the text, and not only about the particular terms, limiting a lot the use of traditional models based on text mining, that are usually found in the use of manually developed dictionaries to which a valence modifier is associated. For this reason, the present article considers that the manual codification of each tweet not only ensures an assertive thematic clarification (theme of the agenda), but at the same time, it permits to define with higher precision the sentiment derived from the semantic context. Even though it is true that in some cases a content can be associated with certain key words easy to detect with this method (i.e. the concept machismo, clearly associated with gender politics), in other cases it is not possible (i.e. the concept dialogue, that according to context can refer to the necessity of discussing about the Catalan independence process, or against dialoguing with certain leaders or parties involved in said process). Starting from this conception, we apply content analysis (Berelson, 1952; Krippendorff, 2004; Wimmer and Dominick, 2006) adapted to the Twitter environment. We collect a data base with the sequence of the set of tweets published on the official Twitter accounts of the parties represented in the Parliament in the time of the motion, referred to as: PP (Partido Popular); PSOE (Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol); UP (Unidas Podemos, the regional \u201cconfluencias\u201d and also the integration of IU); C\u2019s (Ciudadanos); EAJ-PNV (Euzko Alderdi Jeltzalea - Partido Nacionalista Vasco); ERC (Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya); PDeCAT (Partit Dem\u00f2crata Catal\u00e0); Comprom\u00eds (Comprom\u00eds); Bildu (Euskal Herria Bildu); CC (Coalici\u00f3n Canaria); NC (Nueva Canaria); FA (Foro Asturias); and UPN (Uni\u00f3n del Pueblo Navarro). The total number of tweets gathered during the 6 days of the study (from 29 of May to 3 of June 2018), that included the two days prior to the first session of the parliament debate (1st of June) until the two days after the second debate and the approval of the motion (3rd of June), was: PP, 247 tweets; PSOE, 463 tweets; UP, 180 tweets; C\u2019s, 491 tweets; EAJ-PNV, 61 tweets; ERC, 493 tweets; PDeCAT, 226 tweets; Comprom\u00eds, 184 tweets; Bildu, 216 tweets; CC, 130 tweets; NC, 91 tweets; FA, 19 tweets; and UPN, 23 tweets. The last two regional parties (FA and UPN) were discarded from the compositional study due to lack of data representation in comparison with the sample of parties in the study.  Following Blasco-Duatis et al. (2019), a list of eighty topics related with the coding of the set of tweets analysed, was compiled. Subsequently, and for conceptual similarity, the topics were grouped into 12 categories from which only 9 with sufficient representative entity were selected, hereinafter named top9: (1) Catalan independence (application of the article 155 of the Spanish constitution, referendum 1-O, separatism, independence, TV3, Bildu and Otegui on the Catalan independence, parallelism with the Basque process, formation of the Government of Generalitat de Catalunya, President of Parliament Carme Forcadell\u2019s birthday, appointment of the Consellers of Generalitat); (2) territorial policy (autonomy policy, strictly territorial questions, regional competences, multinationalism, Canary Islands\u2019 Day, the fall of the Podem municipal government in the city of Badalona); (3) economy-employment (General Budgets of Spain, regional funds, pensions, taxes, municipal capital gains tax, PNV against UPN in the blocked European investments, global economic crisis); (4) corruption (commission of inquiry into the irregular financing of Partido Popular, the B\u00e1rcenas case, positions of trust, the Dolores de Cospedal case, the RTVE Court of Auditors case, the Orihuela mayor case, the Daniel De Alfonso case, the commission for the corruption of Partido Popular at the Congress, informative manipulation on corruption); (5) gender (gender violence, La Manada case, equality, family conciliation, cases of church abuse); (6) European policy (steel agreement, debates at the European Parliament, relations of the EU countries with Spain, European policy associated with the Catalan case); (7) education-culture (pact on Basque education, education commission at the Congress, new Valencian toponyms, Sant Andreu de la Barca Secondary School case, universities, research, university grants); (8) social policies-health (Menas, surrogacy, dependency,  189 environment, sustainability, adapted sport, freedom of expression, social emergency, vote to repeal the Ley Mordaza, health, drug trafficking in Campo de Gibraltar); (9) regeneration policies (change of government, two-party system, health of democracy, health of institutions). It should be noted that in the process of coding the tweets it was deemed appropriate to categorise each one with as many topics (categories) as identified in their text. That is how there are various tweets that have been categorised in two or more categories (i.e. a tweet about the implications of the Catalan independence in an EU country has been coded with two themes (6) European politics and (1) Catalan independence). At the same time, and related with the sentiments\u2019 codification process, most of the published works in the field have focused on the dual approach of \u201capproval or rejection\u201d, that is to obtain a positive or negative qualification (Turney, 2002). An additional step of this model implies an intention to determine the textual indicators not only by a binary classification, but also establishing a scale of intermediate sentiments that are associated with certain semantic and context constructions. In this sense, and following the pioneer work of Moreno-Ortiz and P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez (2013) about the sentiment analysis of the messages in Spanish on Twitter, we decided to establish the following categories: VP (positive, in favour); P (more positive than negative, more in favour than against); NEUT (neutral, neither positive nor negative, of informational character); N (more negative than positive, more against than in favour); VN (negative, against); NONE (no sentiment is associated, usually derived from tweets linked to the activities\u2019 agenda of the party or its representatives). So, unlike the process of codification-categorisation described before about the themes of the agenda, we attribute a single sentiment to each tweet. In a compositional level, the application of this method is particularly important in its representational phase, since it does not only permit the study of the themes by their issuers (agenda-setters), but it also transforms the analysis in a three-component study and adds the sentiment composition to the specific interactions of the agenda.   2.2. Analysis and visualisation of data Following Marine-Roig and Ferrer-Rosell (2018), Ferrer-Rosell et al. (2019, 2020a, 2020b, 2020c), and Ferrer-Rosell and Marine-Roig (2020), the analysis of contents and communication styles centres its interest in the relative importance of such contents and styles, that is their proportions, which turns such analysis into a compositional analysis (Aitchison, 1986; Van den Boogaart et al., 2013; Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn, 2016; Filzmoser et al., 2018; Greenacre, 2018; Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015). The analysis of compositional data is defined as the analysis of the parts of a whole when the interest lies on the relative size of their D elements, parts or components. A composition is expressed as a vector of positive parts:  . (1) In our case, the part xj represents the number of times that the content or theme appears in the tweets of a specific party. Compositional methods presuppose that two parties distinguished from the fact that one emits twice as much of each theme than the other, constitute of two identical parties concerning the research questions. Thus, such questions consider it to be trivial and of minor interest that some parties are more active in the networks than others, globally speaking, and therefore emit more of each theme.  To calculate a measurement of central tendency, taking into consideration such relative and not absolute importance of the themes, the geometric mean is used, and it is rescaled to an arbitrary total that is easily understood, for example 1 (proportions) or 100 (percentages). To calculate a measure of association, in this type of data correlations are disregarded and replaced by the concept of proportionality. If two themes j and k move proportionally, their ratio remains stable and the logarithm of their ratio has zero variance.    (2) Thus, the correlation matrix is substituted by the so-called variation matrix, which contains such variances of logarithms of ratios calculated for every possible theme pair j=2,3,...,D; k=1,2,...,j-1. Like the correlation matrix, it is symmetrical. As commented, the value zero implies a perfect direct association between two themes. Instead, there is not any upper threshold that indicates a perfect inverse association. High values of the variance indicate that the two themes do not vary proportionally.  As stated in (2), the logarithms of ratios, termed log-ratios, play a fundamental role in the analysis of compositional data. The transformation with centred log-ratios (clr) indicates the relative importance of ()=> =x12...    with   0,  1,2,...,Djxx x x j D\n\u00e6\u00f6=\u00e7\u00f7\u00e8\u00f8var ln 0.jkxx 190 each theme, regarding the other themes present in the composition. One way to understand this transformation is comparing each part with the geometric means of the rest (Filzmoser et al., 2018):    (3) When the data contain zeros (in our case, themes not often recurring that are not treated in any message of a specific party) the log-ratios cannot be calculated, therefore it is necessary to somehow deal with the zeros before the analysis. In content analysis this corresponds to the so-called count zeros, and is usually treated by Bayesian imputation methods, as it is recommended in Mart\u00edn-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. (2015). In the same way as classical statistical analysis, the analysis of compositional data requires graphic tools for data visualisation. A very useful tool is the compositional biplot (Aitchison and Greenacre, 2002; Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn, 2016), and more specifically the compositional covariance biplot. It is the standard biplot resulting from the principal component analysis based on the covariance matrix of the transformed data with centred log-ratios. The biplot represents jointly the relative importance of the D contents or themes subjected to the clr transformation and the agenda-setters (in this case the political parties), in the first two dimensions of the principal component analysis. The themes are usually represented as vectors with origins in the centre of the coordinates and the agenda-setters as points. The biplot constitutes the best possible approximation of the original data in two dimensions. The quality of this approximation is indicated by the variance percentage explained by those first two dimensions. In the covariance biplot the main interpretational element is the between the extremes of the theme vectors. Such distance is approximately proportional to the standard deviation of the log-ratio between the two involved themes, in other words, the square root of (2). Extremes of the vectors that are close to each other indicate themes that keep an approximate proportionality, in the sense, for example, of theme pairs that if the proportion of one is doubled in certain political parties, the proportion of the other is doubled as well. Extremes far from each other indicate the contrary, in the sense, for example, of theme pairs that if the proportion of one increases in certain parties, the proportion of the other decreases.  The biplot also permits to visualise the approximate importance of each theme for each party, in relative terms. If we project the parties orthogonally (we \u201cdrop\u201d them forming a 90-degree angle in the direction defined for each theme vector), the direction indicated by the theme vector points towards the parties with a higher content of the theme, relatively speaking, identifying, in this way, which themes contribute to distinguish each party from the rest. More recently, biplots with more than one composition have been developed (Ferrer-Rosell et al., 2020c; Filzmoser et al., 2018; Kyn\u010dlov\u00e1 et al., 2016) that allow to complement the traditional interpretation which has been explained within the same composition, with the relationship between compositions. The present article constitutes the first compositional content analysis in using this tool.  Given the centred log-ratios of a second composition y (in our case the number of times that each one of the S sentiments is expressed in the tweets of each party):   (4) the biplot of two compositions is constructed from an analysis of principal components based on the covariance matrix between the D+S centred log-ratios. In this biplot, the distances between the extremes of the vector of the same composition, are interpreted on the same way as described. The parties can be projected orthogonally upon any vector of any composition. Additionally, the cosines of the angles between the vectors of different compositions are approximately equal to the correlations between their corresponding centred log-ratios, and therefore between their relative importance. Let us remember that two parallel arrows in the same direction correspond to an angle of zero degrees, whose cosine is one and indicates the maximum positive correlation; that two parallel arrows in the opposite direction correspond to an angle of 180 degrees, whose cosine is minus one and indicates the maximum negative correlation, and that two perpendicular arrows correspond to an angle of 90 degrees, whose cosine is zero and indicates no correlation. Thus, acute angles indicate positive correlation and obtuse angles negative. It is advisable that D and S are of the same type of magnitude, otherwise one of the two compositions could dominate the analysis, which can result in poor quality of the representation of the other.  The replacement of the zeros was done with the R package \u201czCompositions\u201d (Palarea-Albaladejo and Mart\u00edn-Fern\u00e1ndez, 2015) with the command cmultRep default options, which is the so-called Geometric ()----\u00e6\u00f6\u00e6\u00f6 \u00e6 \u00f6\u00e6\u00f6-\u00e7\u00f7\u00e7\u00f7 \u00e7 \u00f7\u00e7\u00f7=\u00e7\u00f7\u00e7\u00f7 \u00e7 \u00f7\u00e7\u00f7\u00e8\u00f8\u00e8\u00f8 \u00e8 \u00f8\u00e8\u00f81211123 1 3 1 2 11ln ln ... ln .... ... ...DDDDDD Dxx xDclrDxx x x x x x x xx\n()-- --\u00e6\u00f6\u00e6\u00f6 \u00e6 \u00f6 \u00e6 \u00f6-\u00e7\u00f7\u00e7\u00f7 \u00e7 \u00f7 \u00e7 \u00f7=\u00e7\u00f7 \u00e7 \u00f7 \u00e7 \u00f7\u00e7\u00f7\u00e8\u00f8 \u00e8 \u00f8 \u00e8 \u00f8\u00e8\u00f81211 123 1 3 1 2 11ln ln ... ln... ... ...SSS SSS SyyySclrSyy y y y y y y yy 191 Bayesian Multiplicative method (GBM) of Martin-Fernandez et al. (2015). The percentage of zeros, as recommended, was reduced, 6.1% in the contents\u2019 composition and 3.0% in the sentiments\u2019 composition. The rest of the analyses were done with the programme CoDaPack (Thi\u00f3-Henestrosa and Mart\u00edn-Fern\u00e1ndez, 2005). The advantages of using compositional data analysis, the biplots and the transformation by centred log-ratios have been treated both generally (Aitchison, 1986; Van den Boogaart et al., 2013; Filzmoser et al., 2018; Greenacre, 2018; Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015) and also in the specific case of political communication studies (Blasco-Duatis et al. 2018a; 2018b; 2018c; 2019).  Table 1: Example of the differences between the traditional approaches of relative frequencies (above) and ranks (centre), with the compositional data approach with log-ratios (below)    VP P NEUT N VN NONE Original data out of 100 Bildu 46.3 10.7  7.0 8.4 22.0 5.6 PSOE 60.7 10.4 7.1 3.0 17.5 1.3 UP 54.2 9.5 6.7 2.8 26.3 0.6 Ranks Bildu 6.0 4.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 1.0 PSOE 6.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 5.0 1.0 UP 6.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 5.0 1.0 Centred log-ratios  Bildu 1.3 -0.1 -0.6 -0.4 0.6 -0.8 PSOE 2.0 0.2 -0.1 -1.0 0.8 -1.8 UP 2.0 0.3 -0.1 -0.9 1.3 -2.6 Source: Own elaboration   We summarise here some of the most important ideas with a small example. Compared with the traditional approaches of using the original data referred to a common total, and transforming the data as ranks, the approach presented here is one that takes into consideration the differences in the relative importance of the themes and sentiments. Table 1 shows a fragment of the sentiments\u2019 composition for three parties. The biggest difference in absolute value is encountered between Bildu and PSOE regarding the VP sentiment. Even so, the difference in relative terms between 60.7 and 46. 3 is only 31%. The biggest difference in relative terms is encountered between Bildu and UP regarding the NONE sentiment. The difference in relative terms between 5.6 and 0.6 is 833%.  On the original data, the Euclidean distance Bildu-PSOE is 16.6 and the distance Bildu-UP 11.8, considering the bigger differences in absolute value. On ranks, the distances Bildu-PSOE and Bildu-UP are both 1.4 because even though PSOE and UP are not identical in their values, they are so in their ranks. On the centred log-ratios, the distance Bildu-PSOE is 1.5 and the distance Bildu-UP is 2.2, taking into account the bigger differences in relative terms, that constitute the analysis objective.  Another aspect to have in mind are the spurious correlations since the rows of Table 1 have always a fixed sum. In relative terms one part can only increase if at least another part is reduced, which leads to mainly negative and uninterpretable correlations. Of the 15 correlations between pairs of sentiments, 7 are negative on the original data, 11 are negative on the ranks and 12 are negative on the centred log-ratios. For this reason, compositional analysis avoids using the correlations among the parts of the same composition, and it substitutes them with the variances of the log-ratios between pairs of parts (2), that do not bear this problem. The correlations between parts of different compositions are valid and they are the only ones that we use in this article.   3. Results According to the geometric means expressed over a total equal to 100, the composition centres show that the most recurring themes are, in this order: territorial policy (21.2%), economy-employment (17.6%), corruption (16.1%), Catalan independence (15.9%), regeneration policy (9.3%), social policies-health (6.3%), education-culture (5.6%), gender (4.2%) and European policy (3.9%); and the sentiments more frequently expressed are, in this order: VP (40.1%), P (19.2%), VN (16.4%), N (11.9%), NEUT (9.8%), and NONE (2.1%).  192 The variance explained by the first two dimensions of the principal component analysis is 55%. A third dimension would allow to reach 71% at the cost of the visualisation of a two-dimensional graphic. As in any principal component analysis, the representation quality of each vector depends on its individual variance percentage explained by the first two dimensions, of which the mentioned 55% is only an average (Daunis-i-Estadella et al., 2011). In this case, the contents worst represented are gender (24.6%) and education-culture (21.4%). The sentiments worst represented are P (3.4%) and N (16.7%). Their extremes and directions in the graphic must be interpreted with extreme caution. On the contrary, the following vectors are represented in an especially reliable way: the Catalan independence (72.6%), the territorial policy (77.5%), the corruption (60.8%), the social policies and health (66.9%), the regeneration policy (67.6%), the sentiments VP (56.3%) and the absence of sentiments -NONE (74.7%). According to the proximities of the theme vector extremes, the pairs of themes that tend to move together in the different political parties are regeneration policy with corruption, European policy with Catalan independence, economy and employment with social policies and health, and economy and employment with territorial policy. According to the proximities of the sentiment vector extremes, the sentiments that tend to move together in the different political parties are the central ones, that is, P, NEUT and N, even though, as we have mentioned, some of them are represented in the biplot with poor quality. The most prominent opposition is found between NONE and the rest all the others.  According to the orthogonal projections on the vectors represented with higher quality, the most notable associations between parties and themes are Cs, ERC, PDeCAT and PP with the Catalan independence; UP and PSOE with regeneration policies and corruption; and NC, CC, Bildu and EAJ-PNV with economy-employment and territorial policy. The most notable theme absences that are generally popular in particular parties are corruption in NC, CC, Bildu and EAJ-PNV; Catalan independence in NC, UP and Comprom\u00eds; territorial policy in C\u2019s and UP; and economy-employment in PSOE, UP and C\u2019s. Figure 1: Covariance biplot of the top9 themes, the sentiments and the political parties in the 2018 motion of no confidence to the Spanish government  \n Source: Own elaboration \n 193 According to the orthogonal projections, the most notable associations between parties and sentiments are C\u2019s, ERC, Bildu and PP with NONE; Comprom\u00eds, UP, C\u2019s and PSOE with VN; and NC, UP, Comprom\u00eds, PSOE and CC with VP. The most notable sentiment absences in parties are VP in C\u2019s, ERC, PDeCAT and PP; and VN in NC, CC, Bildu and EAJ-PNV. As we have indicated, in this article we present for the first time a biplot of two compositions in the content analysis of political communication. As a novelty, this approach opens the door of interpreting as correlations the angles between parts of one composition and parts of another, and in our case to answer the question concerning which sentiments tend to be expressed by the parties in relation to which themes during their communication on Twitter.  Acute angles between vectors show the following notably positive correlations between themes and sentiments: VP with social policies-health; NONE with the Catalan independence and European policy; and VN with regeneration and corruption. Obtuse angles between vectors show the following notably negative correlations between themes and sentiments: VP with the Catalan independence and with European policy; VN with territorial policy; NEUT with corruption and NONE with social policy-health. The angles that are almost right indicate absence of relation. For example, to express VP sentiments is independent of whether the theme refers, or not, to corruption or regeneration, to express VN sentiments is independent of whether the theme refers, or not, to European policy.   4. Discussion  As we pointed out before, there are several studies that have analysed the Twitter transmission data as a source of identifying current news and real-world events (Broersma and Graham, 2012; Thelwall et al., 2011; Neuman et al., 2014; Guo and Vargo, 2015; Calvo and Aruguete, 2020; Lee and Xu, 2018), concluding that the tendencies on Twitter are usually the most important events of the day and can be used to predict the news headlines. In our study, we detect that the themes that centered the debate of all the parties were, essentially, those that impelled PSOE to lead the 2018 motion of no confidence to the government. That is how the issues related to territorial policy, economy/employment, corruption and the Catalan independence were the central thematic axis of the parties\u2019 conversation, with approximately 70% of thematic coverage. In this way, we can confirm that the framework set by PSOE for the discussion on the motion of no confidence was, at the same time, the mark that centered the discussion of the political parties on Twitter. At the level of the parties\u2019 sentiment (attribute agenda), the messages of positive or very positive sentiment (close to 60%) stand out clearly above the negative or very negative ones (a little over of 28%). A possible explanation to these data would be the expected supports that PSOE had in that moment in order to forward the motion, since it had potentially more parties in favour of it (UP, ERC, PDeCAT, PNV, Comprom\u00eds, Bildu, NC), than against (PP, C\u2019s, UPN, FA). Yet, and as we noted in the previous chapter of the results, it is worth highlighting that the most representative sentiments among the political parties (that are usually associated and, therefore they move together) are those in the centre (P, NEUT and N). In our study about the themes that focused the agenda it is also interesting to see the association established among certain themes. That is how we can clearly identify pairs of themes that are proportional between them, meaning that the more you talk about one theme, the more you talk about the other. This phenomenon is especially visible with the following pairs: regeneration policies and corruption, central axis of the motion debate; European policy and Catalan independence, clearly associated with the internationalisation of Catalan political conflict; economy/employment and social policy/health, focused in reversing the austerity policies of the government of Mariano Rajoy; the same as with economy/employment and territorial policy, associated with territorial inequalities and lack of regional investment. In the link established between specific themes and political parties, it is interesting to comment the following associations: C\u2019s and PP vs. ERC and PDeCAT with the Catalan independence, where the first two parties maintain a position clearly contrary to the other two, but they are highly equivalent in terms of dedication on the theme; NC, CC, Bildu and EAJ-PNV with economy/employment and territorial policy, an association clearly connected with the traditional territorial demands of the nationalist parties about the investment in the region they represent; and finally, UP and PSOE with regeneration and corruption, which was not only the central programmatic axis of PSOE in defending the motion to the government, but it also was one of the elements of the opposition in the years of the government of Mariano Rajoy. The notable correlations between sentiments and themes also contribute with some interesting results to comment about the development of the second level agenda. While it is true that the general perception  194 about the Catalan independence theme is such that in the last years has raised highly polarised debates as far as the derived sentiments are concerned, in the case that concerns us of the agenda-setters on Twitter, a tone of neutrality predominated among the parties during the motion. On the contrary, themes like social policies-health (VP) or regeneration and corruption (VN), maintained their logic -as established by the socio-political debate of the country- in capturing extreme sentiments. This phenomenon is strengthened by certain absences of relation as for example NEUT with corruption.  Precisely in the theme of corruption (as well as that of regeneration, that as we have commented they appear to be closely related) it is interesting to have a pause for thought in the analysis of its components, since the representation of the leitmotif that impulses the motion on behalf of PSOE can be observed in it. The parties associated in the most notable way with this theme and with a sentiment of VN are UP and PSOE, followed by C\u2019s and Comprom\u00eds. On the other hand, PSOE and some parties that would support the motion (UP and Comprom\u00eds) would also wish that the substitute government would be more sensitive to social policies, health, gender and equality, themes on which the sentiment VP was expressed. On the contrary, those who are further away from this alliance are the nationalist parties like Bildu, CC, NC and PNV (especially focused on the themes of territorial policy and with a sentiment more N than VN concerning corruption). Meanwhile, PP has a very close position (both at the thematic and sentiment level) to the Catalan independence formations of ERC and PDeCAT. In this sense, corruption is not a priority theme for those three parties, but they focus, and from NONE sentiment, in the themes of Catalan Independence and European policy. From all this, we are able to verify that while the motion was presented to suspend the functions of a government, whose party had just been condemned for corruption, the same governing party (PP) hid behind the Catalan independence frame in order to avoid the main theme of the motion of no confidence.  These results respond to our initial intention to achieve a visualisation of compositional data that would allow us to represent the attribute agenda, by advancing the representation of the agenda and the agenda-setters as political parties, towards the visualisation of the sentiments connected to the messages published on Twitter. With that, not only have we managed to map which parties emphasize which contents or which themes or parties are more or less similar to each other, but we have also incorporated, in this compositional study concerning the agenda, the sentiment analysis. Therefore, we consider the method\u2019s capacity of sentiment visualisation and study in the scene of the attribute agenda proven, being especially relevant for its ability to prioritise the relativity of the elements under study.   5. Conclusions  In this article we present a sentiment analysis on the discussion over Twitter, by the main political parties concerning the 2018 motion of no confidence to the government of Spain. We extract and analyse compositionally 2824 tweets, as well as their associated sentiments, that were posted by the political parties represented at the Deputy Congress. In particular, we develop, document and apply a methodological approach which is innovative in the field of sentiment analysis concerning political communication, systematising its application in order to achieve the visualisation of those sentiments in the narration of the political parties, and on the various topics of the agenda exposed on Twitter. In the of 2018 motion of no confidence to the Spanish government, we find that: \u2022 70% of the parties\u2019 conversation on Twitter on the motion of no confidence was centred on only four themes (territorial policy, economy/employment, corruption and Catalan independence). Those themes, that served PSOE as \u201cred\u201d lines in order to put forward this motion, were the framework of the discussion on Twitter by the political parties.  \u2022 The predominant sentiment in the parties\u2019 messages was more positive (60%) than negative (28%), an atmosphere clearly associated with the fact that there are more parties potentially in favour of the motion and, therefore, wishing that it would all end up moving forward.  \u2022 There are certain groups of themes that are more associated among them than with others, and at the same time they are also associated with certain groups of parties. In this line the following stand out: C\u2019s, PP, ERC and PDeCAT with Catalan independence; NC, CC, Bildu and EAJ-PNV with economy/employment and territorial policy; and finally, UP and PSOE with regeneration and corruption.  \u2022 The sentiments more equitably distributed in the messages of the parties tend more towards the centre (P, NEUT and N), than the extremes (VP, VN).  195 \u2022 It is remarkable that the theme \u201cCatalan independence\u201d which has raised big sentiment polarities in the public debate, would reach a clear tone of neutrality in the case of the parties\u2019 debate for the motion of no confidence on Twitter.  \u2022 Regarding the previous point, PP has a very close position (both at the thematic and sentiment level) to the Catalan independence formations of ERC and PDeCAT. In this sense, corruption is not the desirable frame for those three parties, but they displace the agenda towards the themes of Catalan independence and European policy.  Likewise, by applying CoDa to the sentiment analysis of the agenda on Twitter, we have been able to test the viability of the method concerning its visualisation and study, focusing the analysis on the relative importance of each theme of the agenda (content), about each party (agenda-setter) and for each sentiment (attribute agenda). In this way, the application of the method to the present case study, has allowed us to visualise and study the second level agenda (or attribute agenda). Through the sentiment analysis we have been able to confirm how the main attributes (VP, P, NEUT, N or VN) are linked to the themes that shaped the agenda and for each party. Thus, and in line to what was presented in the methodological possibilities, the application of CoDa upon two compositions -which for the case we are engaged with is the second level agenda- has proved its valuable contribution to visualise and learn in a compositional way the relations among agenda-setters/parties (points), themes of the agenda (vectors) and sentiments (angles). For this last aspect in particular, the sentiments analysed through angles, we note that the acute angles indicate a positive correlation between the theme and the sentiment, and the obtuse angles a negative one.  It is noteworthy, and as a limitation that we have already described in the methodological development, that the studies in this field should centre, as a priority, in the main themes of the agenda, since those themes with little or no recurrence, increase the zeros and, for that reason, hinder the calculation of log-ratios. In fact, the Bayesian imputation for count zeros is no longer reliable when the percentage of zeros is elevated (Martin-Fernandez et al., 2015) and other methods like correspondence analysis become preferable to the compositional methods (Greenacre, 2018). Also, it is highly recommended that the two compositions should be itemised in numbers of parts of the same order of magnitude, since otherwise one of the two compositions would dominate the analysis and distort the visualisation. This article represents the first proven experience of CoDa of two compositions of the agenda (second level study, or attributes, through sentiments) in the field of political communication. The CoDa methodology goes far beyond data visualisation. For example, a compositional cluster analysis can classify both themes and agenda-setters when there is large number of them or cross the agenda-setter classification by themes with the classification by sentiments. If longitudinal data is available, the agenda-setters may appear in the biplot as trajectories depending on the evolution of their predominant themes, or the agenda can be statistically modelled at a given moment from the agenda at an earlier moment. The repertoire of compositional methods expands rapidly as most of the statistical methods now have their compositional equivalent (Van den Boogaart et al., 2013; Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn, 2016; Filzmoser et al., 2018; Greenacre, 2018; Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015), and with it the further research opportunities focused on the relative importance of themes, issuers and/or attributes.  6.

A mixed approach, of a descriptive type, enabled us to obtain results on emotional aspects associated with users' discourse from the United States in the public sphere. The perspective employed was a transdisciplinary strategy to understand the relevant feelings of tweets in the context of their production. In this case study, data-mining methodologies and their typologies were applied: text, graph and multimedia, as well as an analysis of multimodal discourse for the extraction and evaluation of affective values concerning the trial. We took into consideration all supports, codes and practices of discursive production in microblogging: written and hypertext texts, social links and reactions, multimedia content and users' identities in a systemic relation of meanings. The publications of virtual communities in social networks about political processes are important to study in electoral situations and media events with a high degree of polarization.

Introduction Analyzing the opinions of the public sphere, and even published opinions, is a complex process that inevitably structured as a partial, but useful, view in communicative contexts. The Networks as a technological advances, do not replace the public square, they magnify the perception of democracy. However, at least, they provide a way to citizen participation of users concerning public issues. Media audiences generate significance and emotions, usually about content that has been treated by the media or institutions with greater communicative opulence. The users distribute arguments that make emotional allusion, either directly (adducing the source) or indirectly in their publications, to official news content. Hence, explains the theoretical arguments about gatewatching (Burns, 2011; Burns and Highfield, 2015). We live in a society of networks and media, where audiences cause and reproduce their creative capacities (Martinez, 2013), in this context it is easier to study their views on event polarization politics since we agree to what constitutes a published opinion, a public discourse. We can find voters on social platforms that are instantly participating, commenting and reticulating with content that other users can react by approving, distributing, denying, and/or refuting in virtual communities [1]. Although according to Enguix (2017), \"the great contribution from social networks to digital or analogue media is the undeniable increase in the dissemination of their publications.\" Several authors have assessed the potential of Twitter as a space for political communication (Moya and Herrera, 2015; P\u00e9rez, Haber, D\u00edaz and Zamora, 2017; G\u00f3mez, 2014). According to Orihuela (2011) Twitter and Social networks are giving ordinary people a chance to have a public voice. Engesser and Humpretch (2015) stablish Twitter as a platform where journalists and politicians are especially active. The microblogging service is the 13th most popular service worldwide.  Moreover, it has about 340 million active users [2]. It is one of the most used in digital spaces for political and propaganda purposes, as demonstrated by Donald Trump's campaign that provide him a victory in his first period.  Likewise, when Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter, announced the restrictions concerning political advertisements on this social network, he expressed the role this has played in electoral contexts and its influence on virtual groups [3]. Nevertheless, in the analysis of these public voice of this processes, which include the construction of a collective identity based on emotions, cultural processes, identity, symbolism, social pressures and sources to which these categories have been exposed, in most cases, beyond the possible study of factual content. Thus, public opinion is composed of different valid approaches: the interests and perspectives of senders, controllers and receivers (Briones, 2018); the articulation of its discourse is crossed by three dimensions: the cognitive, the social and the systemic (Portillo, 2004). But, in a functional way, it is possible to analyze the state of public opinion in microblogging through auditable objects: the discourse, its characteristics, practices and the social relations are derived from it. The current scientific production, associated with the extraction of emotions published by users on Twitter, focuses on sentiment analysis as an effective methodology based in text mining on big data [4]. Although in our opinion it should take into account the evaluation of emotional meaning in the multi-support contents and the social networks that symbolically represent affective issues in the speech.  In this aspect, this article sets out the use of a mixed approach based on the use of several types of data mining and multimodal discourse analysis as a methodology.  The choice of such methodological framework suggests evaluating, in a generalized way, the emotional content without segmenting it to a specific support and including categories such as social relations, social influence, the links and the analysis of feelings in multimedia files. We present the results of applying these techniques and research methods in a study case on discursive production with the hashtag #impeachment published by users of the United States of America on Twitter.  1.1. Research background \"Sentiment analysis (SA) is one of the main techniques for studying data large-scale texts (big data) used in social science and communication research politics. Its objective is to recognize and evaluate the emotional value behind the texts that are analyzed, through their structure, classifying them into positive, negative or neutral. Nowadays, this methodology is mainly applied in the interpretation of texts that are spread in social media like Twitter\" (Arcila, Ortega, Jim\u00e9nez y Trullenque, 2017: 975) and with a focus associated to attributes. The syntactic lexicon (Vilari\u00f1o et al, 2015) allows the qualification of the text.  The analysis of feelings is also known as opinion mining. Other authors have called it analysis of subjectivity, the matter has connections with affective computing, the computer recognition and the expression of emotion. As a field of research, it is a part of computational linguistics, an area that studies natural language  201 processing and mining of texts whose object is discourse (Fornari, Abeille, Ferrero, P\u00e9rez, and Boglione, 2019). \"Unlike the manual feeling analysis with human coders or  the  automatic and computer assisted analysis, text mining uses procedures from an automatic supervised machine learning to generate models based on previous data and thus, to be able to predict with a significant degree of reliability the actual feeling of messages: it also allows you to run filters on queries, for examples, of dates, languages, geographic locations or labels included in the text of the message that will analysed\" (Arcila et al, 2017). The lines of research in virtual community spaces, where a large number of open-access data to obtain results on public emotions and perspectives merge, have turned in four essential aspects: - Theoretical and methodological proposals for the use of software, algorithms [5] and approaches to cybernetic sciences for the detection of patterns focused on the feelings of users (Colle 2002, 2013, 2017; Daniel, 2010; Cohen and Hamilton 2011; Mancera and Pano, 2013a, 2013b; Diakopoulous, 2015; Coddington, 2015; Perez, Haber and Duvergel, 2016; Perez et al, 2017; Hermida and Young, 2017; V\u00e1llez and Codina, 2018; Conde, Pullaguari and Prada, 2019). - Use of text mining (Zappavingia, 2011; Reyes, 2012; Ortega, Fonseca, Guti\u00e9rrez and Montoyo, 2013; Vilares, Alonso and G\u00f3mez, 2013; Abascal, L\u00f3pez, and Zepeda, 2014; Almgrem and Olssom, 2015; Vilari\u00f1o et al, 2015; Arcila et al, 2017, Figueira, and Guimar\u00e3es, 2017; Verbeke, Berendt, d'Haenens, and Opgenhaffen, 2017; Hernandez, 2017; Van Hee, 2017; Kwabla, Kwame, and Katsriku, 2017; Martinez, 2017; Reyes, Paniagua and S\u00e1nchez, 2017; Gonz\u00e1lez, Hurtado and Pla, 2018; Garc\u00eda, Henr\u00edquez and Herrera, 2019). - Qualitative analysis for the detection of emotional affective values (G\u00f3mez, 2014; Ventura, 2016; Mar\u00edn and Quintero, 2018). - Proposal for the use of mixed tools or techniques (quantitative and qualitative) for the detection of feelings and affections (De Uribe, Pascual, and Gasc\u00f3n, 2016; Suau, Percastre, Pal\u00e1 and Pont, 2017; Bavaria, 2017; Rodr\u00edguez and Haber, 2017; Aguirre, Hern\u00e1ndez, Brice\u00f1o and Mar\u00edn, 2018; Vallejo, 2018) In the theoretical-methodological proposals, it is worthy to highligh the scientific production of Daniel (2010), who exposes methodologies from various sciences including perspectives and paradigms of qualitative, quantitative and mixed approach analysis which implies a transdisciplinary analysis for the study of virtual communities. Furthermore, Colle (2017) exposes the need for algorithms that, although they are not 100% effective, they allow you to detect patterns and qualify the context in large data sets. The use of polarity detection and opinion texts is quite effective, although it is constantly improvement based on its linguistic characteristics and still needs more effective algorithms in the detection of resources such as irony and sarcasm, say authors such as: Reyes et al (2012), Ortega et al. (2013), Hernandez (2017) and Van Hee (2017). In text mining, symbolic techniques are used that make use of lexical resources to examine the polarity. Kwabla et al (2017) explains that through corpus linguistics and text-matching or clustering-based mining [6]. The task of identifying the feeling in a written text is a complex task even for a human being. For this reason, the automated sentiment analysis requires continuous deliberate development and refinement which has been approached from two perspectives: semantic approaches and computerized learning techniques. However, in text mining, the filtering of feelings replies to a specific support on the written text, its characteristics and qualities, but, without taking into consideration all the symbolic constructions of the analyzed sample. The text remains the important part of the communication that we cannot forget, it is the extraction and qualification, which gives as way to specialized software that is capable of measuring polarity [7], links and reactions in large data sets. Nevertheless, given the properties of the user's posts on social media, we cannot eliminate in the context focused on the detection of affection categories such as social relations and multimedia content in expression of emotions. The tweet is a 280 characters unit of meaning that cannot be separated from its retweets, likes, videos, images or links that are part of the content. Likewise, it should be taken into account the number of replies as reaction patterns, although these can be studied separated from the main text (or main tweet) as they come from another user. The reactions (likes and retweets) and replies within the tweet, although measurable attributes through the text filter, are the direct result of the articulation of social relations. According to Cansino et al (2016: 16): \"(...) the tweet is persuasion. A tweet that nobody reads is a tweet that never existed. To transcend, a tweet has to seduce, persuade, convince, motivate... Only then, it will stand out from millions of tweets that are born and die every second (...)\"  202 Although most of the preceding research is oriented towards text mining, there are few exceptions that have paid attention to social relations and the multimedia content. Authors such as Welbers and Opgenhaffen (2019), Wu, Hofman, Mason and Watts (2011), and Gruzd, Wellman, and Takhteyev (2011) noticed a particular importance concerning the social links in conversation in virtual communities as a determining factors in the production of sense and emotional speeches. Social links are measurable through graph mining, technique that provides tools for mapping data structures and finding new connections (relations) between objects or nodes (Chakrabarti, Papadimitriou, Modha, and Faloutsos, 2004). Regarding the analysis of multimedia content, Conde et al (2019) makes a quantitative comparison of the production on Twitter, which mentions the multimedia of political messages published by presidential candidates in Spain, Ecuador and Colombia; paying attention to the messages in different supports in the context of microblogging: notwithstanding, the authors do not go into detail about the emotional content of the sample. In addition, V\u00e1squez (2019) talks about a multimodal analysis in the semiotic relationship between the text of the tweet and the added image. We subscribe that this relationship is a unit of meaning. What we denominate as emotions, feelings and opinions from the point of view of interpretation cannot be only determined through the analysis of written texts in text mining because it assumes a segmented form of the feelings expressed in the public sphere. The project has to identify and take into consideration the graph mining, multimedia supports, the identity and social influence factors; in order to determine their context. Multimedia mining is useful for categorization based on form such as: file type, duration, and size. However, it is less effective in content analysis, so it is permissible the application of qualitative methodologies of manual type to determine the effects used in supports of audio, video and interactive content. Studying not only the written text, but including multimodal values is important since \"it is not in the data structured where the largest volume of information in the world is found, but in multimedia such as images, text, audio and video\" (Oviedo and Velez, 2016:127). Image mining commonly performs a characterization by means of color histograms, texture and shape characteristics that can be extracted. Audio mining makes an advantage to extract low-level characteristics in the time and frequency domain. Finally, mining of videos is presented as the conjunction of text, image and audio features. It can be identified that multimedia mining presents dimensioning problems, as represent it, which affects the performance of analytical methods based on content. Therefore, a qualitative analysis is relevant for emotional data extraction in images, audio and video. Arn\u00e1iz and Filardo (2020) present a multimodal approach in the study of images on Twitter. What we propose is not an overcoming of the arguments and theses of the authors who were above mentioned. We advocate the inclusion of their presentations in a more comprehensive perspective. Due to its nature, most of the researches set out in this section, and probably because of the objective that the researches were after, have segmented the analysis of feelings and opinions into a specific support. The studies associated to the discourse, which is the productive space where we find the representation of feelings, have to use multiples methodologies for the detection of patterns in their multi-supports samples. They also need complete softwares. These ones facilitate the detection of affective elements in text, graphics and multimedia files. The researcher has to present an active attitude in the review of the filters and the detection of the effectiveness of the algorithms, a human accompaniment. Similarly, we  suggest not to suppress the use of qualitative techniques, such as discourse analysis, due to the fact that they are necessary in the research of audiovisual materials; whose expression and content cannot be effectively categorized yet by data mining software. We are talking about an assimilation of the methodologies presented by the authors, all useful, qualitative and quantitative, but more efficient together in a mixed, yet complex and transdisciplinary approach. Furthermore, we propose a generalized vision that integrates several categories or codes of practice on Twitter feeds: texts (tweets, replies, links, hashtags, user identities available at the bio), graphics (social and label relations), multimedia (content and form in photo formats, audio and video) and text-graphic-multimedia relationships. A symbolic system has to be analyzed from of the parts that make up the whole of their practices of meaning and emotional production. Therefore, in this report, we present a descriptive research on emotions published by users in virtual communities on Twitter. From a mixed approach using quantitative and qualitative tools to obtain results, we focus on the study of particular cases of #impeachment in microblogging.   203 1.2. Political context of #impeachment The development of the impeachment process of Donald J. Trump, who is the president of the United States of America, began on December 18th 2019, when, following testimony hearings, the House of Representatives approved the denunciation that charged the president of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. The first session was held on Tuesday January 21st and the last one on February 5th 2020, when the Senate acquitted and shut down the process after not using any witnesses, evidence or documentation. The news had a great impact on the international arena due to proximity of the United States elections in November 2020 and it was among the users most followed events.  This was significant during the course. The present research report delved into the emotions from their symbolic representation in the speeches. Taking into consideration the social practices carried out during Donald Trump\u00b4s trial on Twitter, we use data mining, its various typologies, and the analysis of the multimodal discourse on the tweets subtracted under the hashtag #impeachment and whose geolocation was located in the United States. The analysed publications were published between 21th and 25th January 2020. This date was selected to assess the contents and the beginning of the impeachment. Moreover, the period was also representative due to the prevalence of original tweets concerning quotations and examples replies and retweets, respectively. Published tweets that did not come from media institutions were taken into account in order to assess the emotional state of the active public sphere that generated content on Twitter during that event. In research, data mining and multimodal discourse analysis behave as useful tools for an analysis of feelings and opinions in the context of microblogging. Likewise, form describes the significance for the public sphere of #impeachment from the perspective of the virtual community that produced meaning concerning this by following the label. Therefore, in the study, the following research questions are answered: - What polarity did the involved users assume in the impeachment speech? - What were the emotions with the greatest number of reactions associated with impeachment? - What were the points of framing, considerations or states of opinion about the beginning of Donald Trump's impeachment trial? The above research questions determined the following objectives: - Compare the polarity of the total number of tweets published in order to measure the state of opinion of users about impeachment. - Determine the emotions in the speech of the tweets with the highest number of reactions (retweets, likes, replies). - Identify the frame, considerations or states of opinion given by the users of the tweets at the beginning of Donald Trump's impeachment.  2. Methodology This article proposes the use of data mining and its various typologies (text mining, graphical mining and multimedia mining) for sentiment analysis in the context of Twitter. It also incorporates the emerging methodology of Multimodal Discourse Analysis as a qualitative tool in a multimedia discursive context. The methodological proposal presented here, structured in a case, assumes a contextualized position in the production of emotional meaning in its various codes in microblogging: multimedia content, user identities, influence of relationships and relationships between users, intertextual relationships, distribution relations, label relations, reactions, among others. We must see the produced speech as an interface that represents a symbolic content, according to Scolari (2018) in the 9th law of interfaces: \u201cThe interface is an ecosystem that includes relations of exclusion, inclusion, convergence, divergence, substitution and extension \u2013 reduction\u2026\u201d, which in consideration of the authors can be identified in the pattern detection by the algorithms that include categorical elements that can be studied in the above-mentioned codes. Therefore, we promote the inclusion of social relationships and the analysis of multimedia files to detect feelings without leaving any of the above categories out of the question. In order to obtain results, data mining was applied with the Stela software, developed by the Datys company in Cuba. The extraction of the tweets was carried out from January 21st and up to 7 days later of January 25th, in order to download the reactions that the published tweets  had with the hashtag #impeachment during the period as such. For the extraction of the tweets, the interface of Twitter  204 application program (API) (REST and Streaming), a freely available resource. The REST API allows you to download and filter the message history of the last 7 days for free. The polarity analysis with the SSA-UO algorithm of the Stela software has a 0.06 % margin of error in polarity detections which is quite acceptable for the identification of qualities in large data sets, an almost impossible task manually. The Stela software processes the messages through various types of mining: text, structure (links), graphics and multimedia, which allows for widespread classification. It also has filters to detect and qualify the tweets according to characters and specific properties. According to Baeza (2009) data mining in social networks works usefully in determining perceptions. The concept of data mining groups together computational techniques that allow the discovery of information, especially characteristics that relate in an unexpected way - or hard to discover - the values of multiple variables in a large number of records. The methods of data mining reveal this information and transform it into valuable knowledge both retrospectively (historical) as prospective (projections) or \"comprehensive\" (understanding what is happening). Hence, it is very important for decision making in companies, organizations and governments. Therefore, the data mining is essentially an exploration and discovery methodology. Data mining does not eliminate human participation to solve the task completely, but simplifies the work significantly and allows an analyst who is not a statistics professional and programming to manage the process of extracting knowledge from the data. There are several methods and the existing software usually includes a battery of programs that operate from different ways and deliver different types of results, mostly accompanied by visual forms to expose the relationships that have been uncovered. The operations that can be performed are, for example: classification, estimation, prediction, relationship detection, modeling, clustering and deviation detection (Colle, 2017). Automated algorithms play a large role in some services.  Concerning this, the objective of data mining is to take advantage of the hyper abundance of information. That is why, in order to work in this technique, it is very relevant to establish specific search terms. The Stela program of Twitter data mining is particularly useful for its wide range of possibilities for extraction and filtering; although it is less factually functional in describing the content of images, audio, videos and interactive media such as surveys. Therefore, multimodal discourse analysis was required to determine the relation between written text and content in other media. \"Multimodal discourse analysis is an emerging paradigm in the field of discourse that extends the study of language per se to the study of language in combination with other resources\" (O'Halloran, 2012: 75). This implies that the analysis of multimodal speech is much more open to the variety of media and the multimedia nature of discourse on digital platforms such as Twitter, which includes several semiotic resources such as image, video and reaction values added to the text in microblogging as the retweet, likes, and replies. It also took into account the fact that users will use arguments to validate the emotional approach to the beginning of the impeachment in the corpus analyzed, even if they did not do so from a classical way of argumentation as Ventura (2016) proves on Twitter. Multimodal discourse analysis allows us to visualize the meaning of a specific event. The theory of metafunctions models and the meaning potential of semiotic resources in: -ideative meaning (i.e. our conception of the world) involves: the experiential, - representation and the way we portray the obtained experience, - the logical; - the interpersonal: the put into action of social relations and the -textual: organization in the form of texts and coherent units (Iedema, 2003). These metafunctions in microblogging are measurable from the subtracted data contextual. We will study the textual meaning construction, understanding as texts the tweets that were emitted. The fact that they not only have a personal emotional dimension, but are the result of the sources to which users and lobbying groups resulting from social relations have been exposed. In fact, according to Foucault (1973), speeches institute, order and organize the interpretation of society, social practices, social actors and relations between them, by building of versions (symbolic representations), containing values, opinions, etc. In this sense we discover orders, rules and regularities in speech, and we recognize the frames adopted by the public sphere. Consequently, in the context of this research we based ourselves on a global analysis and then on a fine analysis guide (Wodak, 2003) on the virtual community, understood as the total number of users who actively posted content or reacted to posted content by giving retweet, like or responding with the tag #impeachment in America. The global analysis guide was applied to the total corpus of 13,661 tweets to determine the forms of most used speeches in the context of microblogging: tweets, retweets, replies and mentions, the comparative measurement of the polarities to which they responded, references to external content to through  205 hypertext, the interrelations between the main hashtag and other textual categories repeated in discourse, as well as the use of resources such as video and image for the production of meaning. On the other hand, the fine analysis was applied to a sample of 100 original tweets considered the most social influence[10]. The tweets were particularly taken into account in the fine analysis because determined an increase in the reactions of exposed users or emitters and a synchronization in the emotional aspect. In order to do so, the following analysis guide was applied: 1. Polarity that was assumed in most tweets. 2. Comparison between the number of likes and the number of retweets. 3. Frames regarding impeachment that were evaluated by the most influential users social (or with a greater number of social relations in the context). 4. Use of images or videos. Assessment of the meaning of visual discourse with respect to written text in the tweet. In the point number 2  of this guide we differentiate the reactions between  the number of likes and retweets given from the point of view of meaning likes to give involves an emotional or primary acceptance. However, the retweet works more directly - as a double acceptance or distribution - because it implies a greater interrelationship, quoting a message: it makes it more strength and support within the discourse of the public sphere.  3. Analysis of the results As part of the overall analysis, the speech forms used in the sample corpus were determined (as illustrated in Table 1). The Stela data mining tool, used to determine this, provides these results with the content analysis filter, which shows a summary of the total. In the case of study, it is representative of the use of original tweets concerning the types of retweets that contained the lowest percentage of issued. The case behaves in an anomalous way, since in other investigations the conversation is given using mostly the retweet as such, as a conclusion; which denotes a level of participation and publication of relevant content by users. Table 1: Discourse ways used in the sample of tweets corpus Discourse ways Published quantity % about total Tweets  4485 33 % Replies 4267 31 % Mentions 3292 24 % Retweets 1617 12 % Source: Self-made based on results obtained through the Stela software.  However, the polarities of the various forms of speech behaved mostly neutral followed by positive statements with the lowest number of negative tweets. (as shown in Figure 1). \n Source: Self-made based on results obtained through the Stela software. 260114209640Figure 1: Comparative measure of total tweets polarity \nPositiveNegativeNeutral 206  References to external content via hypertext are mostly links to publications of media outlets that argue the point of view that was expressed in the tweet. As stated in the Table no. 2 the hypertexts distributed mostly lead to journalistic works of CNN, Rolling Stones, Fox News or Twitter events, although other users also distributed content from these media in an indirect way without sharing the link, for instance, the case of the video where President Donald Trump says he had all the material (referring to the evidence) while \"they\" did not (see https://bit.ly/3ceLjUd).  Table 2: Hipertexts (urls) most shared on tweets Hipertexts (urls) shared on the tweet Number of tweets that contain the hipertext (url) https://fxn.ws/369XIUX 23 https://twitter.com/i/events/1220068532370599936  21 https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/22/politics/trump-lawyers-impeachment-false-claims-scif/index.html 18 https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/23/politics/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-witness/index.html 18 https://twitter.com/i/events/1219696006310199296  16 https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-impeachment-evidence-we-have-all-the-material-they-dont-941140/ 15 https://www.oann.com/sen-cruz-impeachment-trial-is-excuse-for-democrats-to-continue-partisan-attacks/ 15 https://twitter.com/repvaldemings/status/1220017702011535364 13 https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-senate-impeachment-trial-judge-andrew-napolitano 13 Source: Self-made based on results obtained through the Stela software.  The interrelationships between the main hashtag (#impeachment) and other textual categories that are repeated in speech include the use of elements that were identified through matching filters of texts in the interrelationship with other labels and words such as trial, senate, president, and democratic. The conversation was also repeatedly addressed to the figure of Schiff (Democratic Member - of the U.S. House of Representatives and appointed Chief Prosecutor in the impeachment trial), Pelosi (Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. A member of the Democratic Party and considered one of the main faces in the signing and Trump's political trial), Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr, both Donald Trump\u00b4s lawyers during the impeachment. In addition, President Donald Trump's user was directly mentioned (@realdonaldtrump) about 929 times during the 4 days taken as reference for this study. The use of resources such as video and image was identified in 42% of the tweets. In most of cases, it completes the meaning of the text that was written in the 280 characters of the tweet or is announced by the text. Something similar happened with the following one with 18 684 retweets (translated into Spanish by the authors): @tommalone1961: New video about the impeachment The Senate exists for moments like this #HoldtheLine The tweet (above) presents and completes its meaning with the video it publishes where it expresses the importance of the Senate in cases of political confrontation such as the impeachment trial. In a way The Senate's preponderant role in decision making during the year is expressed in 2:17 min. the trial, here is how @tommalone1961 distributes the content published by @NRSC (user of The Senate Majority), and gives it a double acceptance since it subscribes through the retweet of a verified account of the conservative majority in the US Senate. The fine analysis applied to 100 most influential tweets, and responding to the analysis guide set out in the methodology: 1) most of these replies to neutral polarity, only in some cases such as tweet by @tommychong, verified account (comedian, actor, director and activist in the USA), shows a negative attitude, although the content of the tweet is not one of the most influential, with only 81 retweets and 608 likes. It exposes: @toomychong: Trump will be eliminated either by impeachment, senate trial or popular vote. No is mentally fit to be President.  207 He received about 20 replies, most of which refuted the argument, either against it or that in the context of the election won by Donald Trump where the popular vote did not count.  The following graph shows the reactions of the public sphere reflected in retweets and likes. We do not include the replies because the number of them in the most influential tweets was not representative. 2)In this case we conclude that the consensus in the 100 tweets evaluated in the analysis fine in the public sphere of the virtual community that followed the hashtag impeachment was mainly via retweet, that is to say via direct quotation (as we can compare in the Figure 2). \n Source: Self-made based on results obtained through the Stela software.  3) Generally speaking, the tweets with the most considerable social influence were published by community users. The following frames were assumed by the virtual community in order to become judgments on impeachment: They argue that the impeachment of Donald Trump will have no achievement or end. They framed their arguments and used phrases like the ones below: - \"Miserable failure,\" a Democratic attempt that will lead nowhere. - No approval of witnesses or evidence. - Republican majority in the Senate - Impeachment is a waste of money and time for the American people - The Democrats have no case, listening to them is a matter of grace. - The impeachment is about how Trump will win the election in 2020 - In the trial, the whole day is spent without end, some retweets shared the fact that the senator Jim Rish was the first to fall asleep during the impeachment. - There are conversations concerning a Democratic impotence using words against Trump unnecessarily. Schiff's impotence is assumed during the exercise. Other widely shared perceptions of the issue evaluated Donald Trump's attitude as authoritarian and secure given the president's alleged calm and the words distributed by the media where it says that \"we honestly have all the material. They don't have the material\", in that sense it is worthy to highlight the influence of the tweet from @RepValDemings (Member of the House of Representatives of the America. Representative in the Tenth Congressional District of Florida) which expresses the way in which the American president covered up witnesses and documents for the American people and reinforces it with the use of video. Other elements, although to a lesser degree of influence valued as repetition patterns by text match and retweet were: - Donald Trump's impeachment shows divided politicians and a representative contradiction between the two parties. Relevant in the speech in such a case is the tweet with 2066 retweets it expresses: @BrandonStraka: 91-year-old Democrat: \"Get rid of this impeachment charge! As Democrat I'm sick of this! #Walkaway. The tweet contains the video (retweet from @Aikens_Josh) in which a Democratic 91-year-old-politician reinforces the idea about his weariness of the process and the division between parties. 171404287360801000020000300004000050000RetweetsLikesFigure 2. Higher and lower number of reactions per tweetHigher number ofreactionsLower number ofreactions 208 - There were discussions about CNN's argument that 51% of Americans approved to condemn Trump. Several users shared, about 398 retweets the following argument and carried out a survey on Twitter making the publication more participatory. This survey resulted in a 98% approval rating for the absolute option to Trump; although it was obtained from of 1096 votes. The tweet text, which calls for action, mentioned: CNN says 51% of voters want to convict Trump in the impeachment. I want to cast my vote because they never asked my opinion. Let's see how people on Twitter think, we're going to vote... - One of the tweets with 2275 retweets, is an open support to the president, it is shown using the Keep America great again slogan for Trump's 2020 election campaign when he publishes: \"The American people don't want impeachment, they want Donald Trump to keep America great again.\" - Furthermore, as a parody of the impeachment, tweets were published saying that the event of impeachment was to get pens that Pelosi placed for those present there. It is important to notice that the tweets published for this purpose also contained the hashtag #meme. 3) Concerning the use of images and videos there is a tendency to retweet since official publications such as that of the media and other media institutions. The use of image and video media was participatory in the group from the beginning of a laughable, burlesque point of view.  4. Conclusions When it comes to the analysis of feelings, it is relevant to consider the meaning, the significance, the state of opinion in audiences and codes in discourse, the results obtained on the basis of symbolic productions are specific to the context and time of their production. This report presents general conclusions associated with the treatment of impeachment by the public sphere of Twitter in America. In the case study most of the content that was provided through publication of original tweets, although in a second place the conversation took place (replies and mentions respectively), and in a smaller percentage distribution (retweets). The polarity and the emotions that are mostly used in the discourse generated about impeachment are neutral. The users of the virtual community were dedicated to distributing the news from the communication and government institutions, especially indirectly, concerning the state of the matter. However, the most represented affective values, denote a doubt in the effectiveness of the trial for releasing the president of his charge and power. This question is the reflect of the frames of a failed democrat attempt, the majority of shared content samples about the absence of witnesses, documents and factual evidence in the process and the Republican majority in the Senate. Influential users were also highlighted over the total, such as @RepValDemings, @Aikens_Josh and @NRSC who from different political positions assume the insecurity in the condemnation of Donald Trump in the political judgment in the circumstances, an argument that was most widely disseminated through retweets by members of the virtual community. In opinion mining we see a relationship of the discourses with the proximity of the U.S. elections in 2020, in addition to the allusion to the political division between parties. A generation of visual content including memes to parody the situation and the use of multimedia files was included in 42% of total tweets mainly to make sense or to prove the assertions in the written tweet. Study users' emotions about the #impeachment implies a partial vision, as it does not constitute the whole of the public forum, but if a sample active that generates content available for be audit.  5.

The Virtual communities are social aggregates that emerge from the Web when enough people lead to. These public discussions were held for a long time enough, with enough human feeling to create networks of personal relationships in cyberspace. Virtual communities are the result of the natural sociability characteristic of human beings. When they find the right site for the creation of links through the Internet, use communication mediated by computer to carry out social aggregates cohesive by a relationship of trust based on interests common, feeling of identification with others and constant exchange of experiences (Gomes, 2013). 2.

Big Data: A data set or combination of data sets whose size (volume), complexity (variability) and growth rate (speed), make it difficult to capture, manage, process or analyze them by conventional technologies and tools, such as conventional relational databases and statistics or display packages, within the time necessary to make them useful. Their complex nature is part of the great amount of unstructured data generated by modern technologies such as social networks. What makes it useful to big data analysis is that it provides benchmarks in the gathering of large amounts of data that are filtered and qualified quickly and efficiently. 5. Algorithm: An algorithm (from Greek and Latin, dixit algorithmus and this in turn from the Persian mathematician Al-Juarismi) is a prescribed set of well-defined, ordered and finite instructions or rules that allow an activity to be carried out  throughout successive steps that do not generate doubts to whoever must develop such activity. Given an initial state and an input, following steps is reached and a final solution is obtained (Colle, 2017: 6). Usually a data mining program uses several algorithms to filter information and give results about a sample given. 6. Clustering: is a data mining technique that automatically identifies groupings according to a similarity between them (concordance). This is called pattern finding or clustering techniques. 7. Polarity: It is a value assigned to a term that expresses opinion depending on the linguistic meaning of the word and it is based on sentiment analysis or opinion mining methodologies. The value of polarity can vary between different ranges including negative, neutral and positive. (Ramirez, 2017: 47) 8. A network is a group unit that relates nodes connected by edges. In the particular case it refers to the social relations that take place between the users of the virtual community and their ways of linking. 9. The analysis of symbolic representation is based on the interpretation of elements that generate meaning. The manifestation of this sense is limited to a dimension of significance associated with a socio-cultural dimension. See Saussure, (1961); Barthes, (1971); Pierce, (1974); Ver\u00f3n, (1987); Lotman, (1996); Eco, (2000). 10. The social influence is valued as the reactions of retweet, likes and replies of certain content or user about others in the group. That is, the potential of a user's action (e.g., tweet) to initiate future action (by e.g. retweet or reply) from others on the network, which is evidenced by the action of creating a message (tweet) and encourage its subsequent re-tweeting through its network of contacts and the networks of those who receive it and decide to give it currency (Leavitt, Burchard, Fisher and Gilbert, 2009: 5). Two types of influence persist on Twitter: one based on conversation and another based on content.  \n    \t       MISCEL\u00c1NEA / MISCELLANY        \t   Bermejo-Berros, J. (2020).

This encouraged the consumer to store some properties of the brand / product with a favourable attitude in his memory. The decrease in advertising efficacy due to media saturation, overload of information or technical and technological transformations has prompted advertising to seek out new more effective forms of communication. This article highlights the diversification of persuasive strategies favouring interactivity and the circulation of messages beyond the traditional channels. Accordingly, it presents a Model of Levels of Advertising Message Processing, based on the results of this research, integrating the four different persuasive advertising strategies identified in a set. Each of these strategies induces progressive degrees of psychological processing and interactivity with advertising of a different nature, complexity and intensity on the recipient. This generates higher levels of advertising effectiveness than the unidirectional advertising of past decades. These results show that the ways in which the advertisers establish a relationship with the consumer have changed. This has consequences for both the professional sector and the research of the current effectiveness and advertising structure.  Durante el siglo XX, la publicidad utiliz\u00f3 una estrategia persuasiva por mera reiteraci\u00f3n del est\u00edmulo publicitario que buscaba en el consumidor el almacenamiento en su memoria de algunas propiedades de la marca/producto con una actitud favorable. La disminuci\u00f3n de la eficacia publicitaria por la saturaci\u00f3n medi\u00e1tica, la sobreinformaci\u00f3n o los cambios t\u00e9cnicos y tecnol\u00f3gicos, han hecho que la publicidad busque nuevas formas de comunicaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s eficaces. Este art\u00edculo evidencia que se ha producido una diversificaci\u00f3n de estrategias persuasivas que favorecen la interactividad y la circulaci\u00f3n de mensajes fuera de los canales tradicionales, y propone un Modelo de Niveles de Procesamiento del Mensaje Publicitario, basado en los resultados de esta investigaci\u00f3n, que integra en un sistema de conjunto las cuatro diferentes estrategias persuasivas publicitarias identificadas. Cada una de estas estrategias induce en el receptor grados progresivos de procesamiento psicol\u00f3gico e interactividad con la publicidad de diferente naturaleza, complejidad e intensidad, lo que genera mayores niveles de eficacia publicitaria en comparaci\u00f3n con la publicidad unidireccional de \u00e9pocas pasadas. Estos resultados muestran que han cambiado los modos de relaci\u00f3n del anunciante con el consumidor, lo que tiene consecuencias tanto para el sector profesional como para la investigaci\u00f3n de la actual eficacia y estructura publicitaria.

Introduction In recent years, emphasis has been placed on the influence of technical and technological changes on the transformation undergone by advertising communication. However, the current advertising mutation results from factors that are more extensive and more complex. At the end of last century, the advertising sector was already experiencing a steady decline in the effectiveness of advertising investment. Different factors, from both within and without the advertising sector, had accelerated this process of deterioration of the advertising communication system, such as the appearance of home recording and playback systems that afforded access to content by eliminating exposure to advertising, or also advertising saturation in conventional media (Reinares and Reinares, 2007). As a result of this situation of the lack of operability and efficiency, a set of diverse phenomena, led to a process of profound change, of mutation, from the search for solutions adapted to the new digital scenario that would enable the advertising system to recover its functionality. Detailed analysis has shown the indicators of this change to be of a different nature, including the step from unidirectional communication to multidimensional communication, the blurring of borders and the hybridization of genders, prosumerism, viral marketing or the passage from the recipient to the user, the transformation of advertising agencies (Kaufmann, 2017), etc. Researchers, professionals and academics who have analysed this change in the advertising system have highlighted some of the factors of the communication process. In the first group, analysis focused on investigating aspects related to the distribution of information through the multidirectional communication channels that emerged with the digital era, affording numerous ways to interactivity. For instance, the communication exchanges that occur on the Internet, Smartphone and social networks. It is worth noting not just the modes of consumption and communication but also the ways of associating advertising in them effectively. New forms of measurement, through Big Data, focus part of the efforts of advertising analysis in this field (Gordon Zettelmeyer, Bhargava, & Chapsky, 2019; Malthouse, Maslowska, Franks, 2018; Rogge, Agasisti, Witte, 2017). In other cases, research investigates media diversification and communication outside of the traditional conventional and unconventional channels. The so-called off-the-line advertising (L\u00f3pez and Torres, 2007) or viral marketing would be examples of this. A second group of research has been interested in media content. Here we find studies on gender hybridization and border blurring (e.g. Fernandez, 2009). In the first case, this hybridization opens up new possibilities for the inclusion of advertising in the content (e.g. new forms of advertainment, branded content). In the second case, the boundaries between the communication dimensions of the marketing mix are blurred. Advertising and publicity meet again under new forms after a century of separate paths. Finally, in a third group, the research seeks to know some partial aspect of the recipient of the information, which would be going from being a receiver to a user. Thus, there is currently a wide field with studies on prosumer, interactivity, customization or personalization (eg De Assis, 2014, Bleier, Keyser & Verleye, 2018; Kim, 2018), crossumer (Gil and Romero , 2008), the influence of virtual or augmented reality, 360\u00ba or 2D / 3D (Berki, 2018; Correia, Guerreiro, Langaro & Panchapakesan, 2018; Mart\u00ednez, Bign\u00e9, Guixeres, Alca\u00f1iz and Torrecilla, 2018; Laan, Beemt , Mitas & Simons, 2018; Flavi\u00e1n, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez & Or\u00fas, 2018).  The three general orientations of the study of the advertising phenomenon that we have just mentioned are not watertight compartments, as exemplified by the transversal study of interactivity, but they allow us to illustrate both the general topics of investigation and to point out the absence of studies on one of the nuclear dimensions of the advertising process that can help us to better understand the advertising mutation in its search for advertising effectiveness. Thus, despite the changes introduced in the advertising system, which have led to the introduction of new communication channels, to modify and adapt the contents to the new context of hybridization and, thirdly, to take into account some user characteristics of the media, problems remain. Overinformation and advertising saturation are still present in the media-advertising context and continue to generate the rejection that had already been detected in the last century, so the degree of advertising effectiveness remains in question (AIMC, 2018; Castell\u00f3, 2011; del Pino, 2007). Faced with this scenario of media hyper-stimulation, the problem of the so-called attention economy (Davenport and Beck, 2002) is a major challenge for advertisers and, in general, for the entire audiovisual communication and entertainment industry. Advertising has to find ways to attract limited user attention resources in a very competitive market full of messages in and out of the media. During the 20th century, the push strategy that pushed the advertising message towards the consumer was mostly used. The question that arises is to know if the advertising mutation in the 21st century has also been accompanied by a change in the persuasive advertising strategies in the new digital scenario that modify the modes of relationship with the public. This inquiry, which is addressed in the present research, has the interest of contributing to a better understanding of the process of change that advertising communication is currently experiencing, as well as to define its advertising characteristics and functions.   219 2. Methodology Since the first empirical studies on persuasion, initiated by the Yale Group (Hovland, Janis, & Kelley, 1953), numerous classifications of persuasive strategies have been proposed (Kellerman and Cole, 2006; Rhoads, 2019), some of which have had considerable impact on marketing and advertising, such as the persuasive strategies of social influence proposed by Robert Cialdini (2011). The analysis of persuasive strategies has been approached from very diverse perspectives such as, for example, critical discourse analysis (Aya, 2017), neuromarketing (Morin and Renvoise, 2018), semiotics (Baquero, 2008), philosophy and rhetoric (Garsten, 2006), narrative persuasion (Huang et al. 2018) and transmedia (Rodriguez et al., 2017), the so-called technological persuasion (Orji et. al 2018; Oinas and Harjumaa, 2009), the routes of persuasion of the ELM (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986), even the so-called dark persuasion (Ericcson, 2019). And, of course, approaches to persuasion in advertising have also been proposed (e.g., O'Shaughnessy and O'Shaughnessy, 2004; Baquero, 2008; Aya, 2017; Walotek, 2017). However, few studies have sought the interrelationship of the persuasive message and the psychological mechanisms of its receptor, simultaneously analyzing both dimensions of this binomial. One of the few works is that of Marie-Odile Taillard (2000), who has proposed a persuasive model that aims to integrate the pragmatic perspective of the message with the contribution of social psychology. Although this work shows the interest of that meeting, Taillard's proposal is theoretical and generic within the field of communication. From a persuasive perspective, does not exist, as far as we know, an approach that allows the confluence and interaction between the advertising message and the psychology of the recipient. In this way, the present research constitutes an initial contribution of knowledge about the persuasive strategies that take place in this interaction between the advertising message and the receiver's psychology.  2.1. Operational delimitation of the notion of persuasive advertising strategy Advertising seeks to influence the consumer by creating or modifying attitudes, inducing the storage of information about the brand/product, or establishing associations of emotional states with the brand/product. That is why, knowing the modes of relationship of advertising with its recipients or users, is nuclear to understand the way in which it operates and fulfills its function as a variable of the marketing mix. This advertising-recipient relationship has a set of features that specify a persuasive advertising strategy that can be defined as a conscious and planned attempt by the advertiser to influence, through one or more actions, some psychological process of the target audience that benefits the brand/product in some dimension of its positioning. Since the persuasive strategy establishes an effective communication between an advertising content, transmitted through some channel or support, and a user or receiver, we can identify a set of features that allow us to describe the characteristics of that persuasive strategy and distinguish it from other argumentative strategies. In this research it is established that each persuasive strategy can be identified according to four features or components that account for the process of interaction between the advertising message and the target audience. These four features are:  \u2022 Modality of advertising: description of the advertising manifestation directed to the user, with indication of the support used, the channel and the properties of the content of the message.  \u2022 Response time: corresponds both to the time lapse between the presentation of the advertising stimulus and the user's response to it, as well as the duration of the latter. \u2022 Relationship mode: type of action expected by the recipient that is relevant and adapted to the pragmatic demands of the advertising stimulus presented. \u2022 Nature of response processing: corresponds to the type of psychological process and mechanism that is sought to be activated in the receiver's behavior. This includes cognitive, emotional and behavioural components. The predominant persuasive advertising strategy during the 20th century, which we can call classic, has been characterized by the following concretion of the four previous features: It was an advertising that was inserted, in a privileged way, in the media or in channels and supports identified as advertising. It was a communication that sought an immediate mental response, essentially of an attentional and perceptive nature (see/hear the advertisement, assimilating and storing in the memory the advertising promise) or emotional by mere classical conditioning. This communication sought, finally, that the consumer stored in his memory some properties of the brand / product with a favorable attitude.      220 2.2. Objectives and hypotheses  The general objective is to investigate whether, in the present scenario of change and advertising mutation, there has also been a transformation in the persuasive strategies used by advertising in its interaction with its recipient. The aim is to investigate whether or not the classic persuasive advertising strategy, which was predominant during the last century and whose features have been described in the previous section, has given way (or not) to new persuasive strategies today. Given that a persuasive advertising strategy can be delimited and described from the analysis of the four traits that define it, the specific objectives of this research are to find out if there have been changes in each of these four traits and if these can be integrated into overall units that allow the identification of some new persuasive strategy. The five research hypotheses that derive from these respective five specific objectives are the following:  H1. Advertising modalities have multiplied in such a way that advertising in the media is now part of a complex network of diverse advertising modalities that include actions inside and outside the media. H2. The immediate response time, predominant in the previous stage, has given way to persuasive strategies that request response times that are also medium and distant. H3. The modes of relationship have been diversified, causing the recipient to develop types of actions that were not demanded in the previous stage. H4. The psychological processes and mechanisms that advertising seeks to activate in the receiver's behavior have become so complex that it requires not only attention and perception but also actions and types of mental processing of different levels of difficulty. H5. In today's advertising, there are new persuasive strategies that diversify the classic strategy prevailing in the last century. Each of them has its own differential characteristics in the four features that define a persuasive advertising strategy and are integrated in a unit or overall structure. In summary, the research seeks to analyze both the advertising message (the content, support and distribution channel, H1) and the expected response of the user in their interaction with it (H2, H3, H4). The unit of analysis thus includes the elements of this interaction present in the four features of the persuasive strategy (H5). Thus, if there is a new persuasive strategy, it must have its own differential characteristics in the unit that form the four features that define it.  2.3. Analysis technique and procedure To find out if there have been changes in persuasive strategies in advertising communication and to be able to test the hypotheses put forward, a synchronic study of a current period has been carried out to enable a comparison to be made between the classic advertising persuasive strategy, characteristic of the last century, and those that may have appeared in the last years of this century. A corpus of advertising communications produced and distributed over three successive years (2016-2019) has been selected. Specifically, the persuasive strategies of a corpus from three sources have been analysed: a) The information included in the advertising investment reports of different communication companies (InfoAdex, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019; Arce-Media, 2016, 2017, 2018; Zenith, 2016) and other specialized sources (ipMark; elpublicista; controlpublicidad.com), which allowed the selection of the campaigns of the 100 largest advertisers in Spain during the selected period; b) Websites specializing in advertising trends and case presentations (e.g. marketingdirecto.com; adlatina.com; puromarketing.com; solomarketing.es); c) Campaigns in networks, blogs and high visibility platforms for advertisers such as \"YouTube\". From these three groups of sources in the selected period 2016-2019, a total of 758 campaigns were included in the corpus, each of which has been analyzed according to the four features that define a persuasive advertising strategy: a) Advertising modality; b) expected response time of the receiver to the advertising message; c) relationship modes induced by the advertising communication; d) psychological processes and mechanisms mobilized in the receiver. Therefore, from the point of view of the collection of materials and the analysis of data, a content analysis of the corpus of advertising content of the above-mentioned campaigns has been carried out. In each advertising content, we have identified the way in which the four analysis features defined in a previous methodological section are implemented. This analysis of advertising content is psychopragmatic in nature (Bermejo-Berros, 2005), since it identifies in each advertising piece the mechanisms and psychological responses induced in its receptor in cognitive-emotional and behavioral terms. This analysis procedure thus includes a description of the interaction of the features of the advertising text (as well as its spatial-temporal context and distribution) with the induced and expected behavior in the recipient. The result of this analysis  221 procedure allows to determine whether or not there have been changes in persuasive strategies in relation to the classic advertising persuasive strategy prevailing in the last century.   3. Results As shown in Table 1, the analysis of the four features that define the strategies in the set of advertising messages of the selected corpus shows that there has been a change due to the appearance in recent years of new persuasive advertising strategies. A horizontal reading of Table 1 (rows) reveals a phenomenon of diversification of the four features of the classic persuasive strategy. Regarding the first feature, if the hegemonic advertising strategy of the last century was one that presented the advertising content predominantly in media or advertising media (a spot, a graphic ad, a billboard, etc.), 46% of the advertising modalities of corpus analyzed, are developed outside the traditional media and have been multiplied as will be illustrated below. Therefore, in accordance with hypothesis 1, the first feature of the persuasive structure has undergone a transformation. Secondly, to the simultaneous response time of the receiver, characteristic of the previous stage, different response times are now added (immediately subsequent, mediated, prolonged and distant), which confirms H2. Thirdly, the way in which the public, consumers and users are addressed has become more complex and diversified. To the relationship mode by simple perceptive exposure of the previous stage, new relationship modes are now added through necessary actions required by the advertising message, mediated interactivity and advanced interactivity. Advertising examples are presented below to illustrate these new relationship modes, which also confirm H3. Fourth, the psychological processes and mechanisms mobilized in the receptors have also diversified, inducing psychological responses that require different levels of cognitive, affective and behavioral processing. To the processing of the advertising stimulus required by the classic persuasive strategy, we now add the need for the receiver to participate, after the advertising stimulus is presented, either through simple and immediate actions, or by articulating a set of successive actions, or by implementing a complex activity of actions that require complex planning and creative processes in the user. Therefore, in response to hypothesis 4, the nature of the response induced by current advertising has multiplied and has become more complex. These results indicate that the four features of the hegemonic strategy of the past century have diversified and become enriched.  A second aspect of the analysis of the results is shown when relating this new set of manifestations of the features of the persuasive strategy to each other. A vertical reading of Table 1 (columns) illustrates a result of interest that emerges in this research. We are witnessing a phenomenon of diversification of persuasive strategies that induce four levels of processing and interactivity with the advertising message in the consumer. The application to the corpus of the selected methodological criteria presented above, leads to the identification and categorization of four types of persuasive strategies that give rise to four forms of advertising. With this result, we went from a uniform and monolithic advertising strategy in the last century to other new forms of advertising that are currently requesting new modes of processing and response to advertising by their recipients. Each of these persuasive strategies has a structure whose four traits are specific, define and characterize it in such a way that it gives rise to a specific type of advertising based on that specific strategy. Thus, as shown in the columns of Table 1, Attentional and Perceptual Advertising, Reactive Advertising, Interactive Advertising and Planned Advertising. The characteristics of these forms of advertising are defined and described in detail below. Therefore, in accordance with scenario 5, this research has led to the identification of new persuasive advertising strategies.  Thirdly, as shown in Table 1, in the 758 advertising campaigns analyzed in the corpus, it can be seen that there is a differential distribution of advertising modalities according to which the highest number of advertising actions is located in the lower levels of processing requirements. As the complexity of the requested cognitive processes increases, the number of campaigns is reduced (Level I 353, Level II 206, Level III 148, and Level IV 51). However, this result has the interest of showing that, in levels II, III and IV, responses and forms of participation are requested from users who were absent in the advertising of the last century. These responses require higher levels of mental processing and cognitive-emotional activity and, consequently, are likely to leave a greater imprint on the consumer's mind. Therefore, the results of the research show that there have been changes in the four features that define a strategy in the sense postulated by the first four hypotheses. Likewise, the analysis of these new persuasive phenomena allows them to be grouped together in structures that define different persuasive levels. The following sections define and describe each of these four persuasive advertising strategies that the research has identified and illustrate, each with some examples in the four types of advertising that result from them.   222 Figure 1. Persuasive strategies and types of advertising in the contemporary advertising according to the level of psychological processing model \n Source: Self made  Table 1. Distribution of advertising campaigns in advertising modalities and processing levels at each level (N = 758) \n Source: Self made  \n 223 3.1. Attentional and Perceptual Advertising Attentional and Perceptual Advertising is one that asks the subject to simply attend and perceive the stimulus. This form of advertising can be directed to both voluntary and involuntary attention processes. The features of attentional and perceptive advertising are characterized by: -In the campaigns analyzed appear eight advertising modalities: Actions without action; Bidimensional Outer; Animated facades (mapping); Tridimensional Outer; Music; Simulated news; Olfactory; Volumetric. Although some of these modalities already existed in the last century, they now acquire, as the examples below illustrate, new connotations as they introduce an association of the brand/product with enigmatic, fun or/and surprising actions in new contexts.  - It demands response resources deployed in an immediate and simultaneous time to the presentation or the contact with the advertising stimulus. - It is a type of direct or interpelative publicity since it is directed to the voluntary attention processes. It induces a simple mode of relationship through a simple perceptive exposure. - The expected response of people is attention and cognitive and emotional processing of the stimulus, i.e. the immediate action is mental and seeks to have the stimulus assimilated. Let's see some examples:  1. Actions without action:  The following three examples of actions without action by the consumer, in which people do not have to do anything, just attend and assimilate what they see or hear:  * In Times Square, a central area of New York, the Red Bull Formula 1 team installs a Pit Stop in which their cars make some spectacular stops. Passersby stop and look surprised at the unexpected spectacle. The video generated more than 100,000 visits in five days and thousands of positive responses on Twitter (https://bit.ly/2MWItYS).  * In the middle of a square in a small Belgian town, suddenly a dramatic action is triggered. The population looks on in amazement at this thrilling scene, believing it to be real. In the end, they discover that it was a staging for the television channel TNT (https://bit.ly/2QqyvRG). The campaign aims to show users the kind of content that viewers can expect from the cable network. The A Dramatic Surprise On A Quiet Square video became a viral phenomenon. In just one week, it had 23 million views (O'Neill, 2012) (https://bit.ly/2tzLSpv)  * In the center of Madrid appears an enigmatic object of 12 meters covered with a black cover. Given its shape and the phrase \"Madrid gets hot\" with which it was presented, people on seeing it speculated on whether its meaning was around eroticism. Three days later, a small show was put on in which the black cover was removed, revealing that it was the new KH7 packaging (https://bit.ly/39GoVBP)  In these examples, as well as in those included in the following sections, a pull strategy is present in which the passers-by voluntarily decide to stop and watch the show that is offered to them.  2. Bidimensional Outer:  A spectacular element is now added to traditional outdoor advertising to attract the gaze of the passer-by (Cf. Image 1-4).  224  Image 1 Source: https://bit.ly/39LsrLp \n Image 2 Source: https://bit.ly/2QLc0pD \n Image 3 Source: https://bit.ly/2Fjaw0x \n 225  \n Image 4 Source: https://bit.ly/39FLBC1  3. Visual Mapping  In this example of mapping, hundreds of families attend a show in which a Christmas story is projected on the fa\u00e7ade of a central building in a large city. It is an audiovisual event full of lights, images and sounds that captivate and move the audience. In the credits of the show appears the sponsoring company that benefits from the positive emotions generated by the show (https://bit.ly/2SPIBgC).  4. Tridimensional Outer:   In the tridimensional outer advertising a component of exaggeration and excessiveness is added (Cf. Image 5-6)   \nImage 5 Source: https://bit.ly/39JZizV \n 226  Image 6 Source: https://bit.ly/39HhqKU   5. Music:  Music not only accompanies the advertising positioning but, as in the example Nike shoes, becomes part of the argumentative process showing the degree of flexibility and malleability of the product (Cf. Image 7) (https: // bit. ly / 2sMIGqA)   \n Image 7. Source: https://bit.ly/2sMIGqA  6. Simulated News:  One morning, giant footprints and some damage appear on a beach (https://bit.ly/2STKaKr). 60 American television channels pick up the news. They interview people, but nobody knows what happened. A few days later it was revealed that it was a montage to promote the film King Kong (see Image 8).  \n 227  Image 8 a. Source: https://bit.ly/2STKaKr \n Image 8 b. Source: https://bit.ly/2STKaKr  7. Olfactory:  Without forcing the consumer, a sensory experience is created in which the brand is activated by smell, creating a link with it. For example, Burger King creates a canopy that reproduces the sensations of a grill (https://bit.ly/39Kmezk).  In another example, Dunkin' Donuts installed coffee scent sprays on several city buses in Seoul. The sprayers were programmed to spray coffee aroma on the buses whenever a Dunkin' Donuts commercial was played on the radio (https://bit.ly/39Gp20d).  8. Volumetric:  It is outdoor advertising, but it goes beyond what was done in the twentieth century because it adds spectacularity to the volume (Cf. Image 9) (https://bit.ly/2rWaMPX).  \n 228  Image 9 Source: https://bit.ly/2rWaMPX  3.2. Reactive or Actional Immediate Advertising Reactive advertising requires the subject cognitive processing and immediate action to the presentation of the stimulus as a reaction to it. This second type of advertising constitutes a second level of processing because it adds to the perceptual processing of the previous level, an immediate reactive or 'actional' response. The features of this type of advertising are characterized by:  - The manifestations of this type of advertising acquire different advertising modalities. Ten types can be distinguished: 1. Participatory action (beneficial to oneself or to the community); 2. Fun; 3. Reaction to an unexpected action; 4. Inverse reactive action; 5. Exaggeration; 6. Tool helps; 7. QR code; 8. Print mix; 9. Immediate augmented reality; 10. Primary or immediate interactivity.   - The consumer response occurs in the lapse of time immediately after contact with the advertising stimulus and is short-lived.  - The relationship mode establishes that the consumer's response action must be specific and directly related to the demands of the advertising stimulus.  - The user\u2019s participation is required through a simple and immediate action that is already available in their repertoire of possible actions prior to contact with the advertising stimulus. That is why the type of processing is easy by simply having to activate a simple action, already available, which is executed either directly or through a technological device Here are some examples:  1. Participatory Action: Participatory action is simple and can result in either personal benefit in the form of a reward or collective benefit. Examples of the former would be:  * In a central street of a city the participants have to run a small distance exceeding 17 Km/h obtaining some sport shoes of the brand as a reward (https://bit.ly/2ZS6Vjc).  * In the middle of a busy train station there is a snack machine from which the volunteer participant is asked to press a button and do a certain number of times a simple action such as jumping, bowing, standing on one leg for a certain time, etc. The scene elicits laughter from spectators who gather around the dispenser to watch the participants take up the challenge (https://bit.ly/2sF5Pvn).  * Samsung posed the following challenge to passengers at a well-known Zurich station: if they stared at the phone for 60 minutes, they could get it for free. It wasn't easy because there were so many fun distractions. \n 229 The video became a viral phenomenon on all social networks. On \"YouTube\" alone it had more than 4,630,000 hits (https://bit.ly/2QKPQUt).  * The participant is given a recipe\u2019s ingredients. He places them on a sheet of paper, mixes them and is ready to eat (https://bit.ly/2FmJHIU).  * On the Coca-Cola website there is an application that, when placing the mobile in a certain position, fills the glass of Coca-Cola Zero. Then you can exchange it for a real Coca-Cola. It can interact with radio, graphics, etc. (https://bit.ly/37H38YZ).  On some occasions, participatory action has a collective benefit. For example:  * By entering the Asturian Dairy Central website and making the simple gesture of turning the Smartphone, the brand will donate a glass of milk (https://bit.ly/2Qqz5Pm).  * China has serious pollution problems. In several streets of its main cities, an inkpad for stamps was placed on one side of a sidewalk, leaving the soles of passers-by shoes impregnated with a special green ink. In the crosswalk a canvas had been placed showing the trunk and branches of a tree devoid of foliage. Passers-by, crossing the street, impregnated it with green ink, which made the tree progressively green thanks to people's footfalls. The great impact of this initiative made people come on purpose to participate in this symbolic initiative on ecological awareness (Cf. Image 10) (https://bit.ly/2QRTqvQ).  \n Imagen 10 Fuente: https://bit.ly/2QRTqvQ  2. Fun  If in other advertising manifestations the fun is present associated with the action, in the following group, the concept of fun is at the center of the advertising action itself.  * On a Stockholm metro exit staircase, they have made a musical note sound on each step, each time you step on it. Thanks to this change, many users, instead of going up the escalator, have fun going up the staircase turned into a piano (https://bit.ly/36qLvML).   * A soundproof room is set up in a library where young people can have fun and take a break from studying for a while by playing the drums (https://bit.ly/37uONyG).  3. Reaction to an Unexpected Action:  Something unexpected happens and you can see the user\u2019s reaction of surprise, fright or disbelief. For example: \n 230  * The person discovers with surprise that, when passing in front of the window of a car dealer, the colors of the car exposed in the showcase change to adopt the same of the clothes she is wearing (https://bit.ly/2Qr1UeD).  * On some other occasions, as in the case of a Halloween\u2019s trick, something unexpected happens that initially scares the consumer and then provokes laughter (https://bit.ly/2MY8lnd; https://bit.ly/36t973h).  4. Inverse Reactive Action:  The opposite of what is expected from the user's action occurs. For example:  * As in many big cities, finding a parking space in Paris is not easy. A motorist finds a very tight space to park between two cars, but to get it he must hit the bumper of both cars. Every time he hits, he scores points on a giant pinball machine on the sidewalk next to the car. Numerous vehicles take up that parking space. In the end, the motorist who has scored the most points and can therefore be considered the least skilful driver to park, receives as a prize a vehicle of the brand that has just put on the market an automatic parking system (https://bit.ly/36qWk1n).  5. Exaggeration:  Although advertising hyperbole has been present in advertising for decades, in recent years it has taken on dimensions of exaggeration and spectacularity. An example that illustrates this would be a telephone brand that celebrates its anniversary by handing out popcorn in a huge container (Cf. Image 11).  \n Image 11 Source: https://bit.ly/2sGnjaG  6. Tool Helps:  * We find this type of advertising particularly in some campaigns with social purposes. For example, in one campaign against drunken driving, machines were installed in leisure spaces such as discotheques, where young people can consume alcohol. When they leave the premises, they can use the machine that tells them whether their alcohol level allows them to drive. In cases where they exceed the limits, the machine issues them a free ticket for a taxi to take them home (https://bit.ly/2QOdY8I).  * In another anti-smoking campaign, the smoker puts his cigarettes in a vending machine and receives a small gift in return (https://bit.ly/39GUpI0).    \n 231 7. QR Code:  * In this case, a QR code is made available to the user, which transfers him/her to the contents of the brand through different modalities (https://bit.ly/2udNaa6; https://bit.ly/35lALOd).  8. Print mix:  Here, printed advertising is hybridized with another support or manifestation. For example, using a Smartphone to see a raised object (Picture 12) or tapping on a mini airbag (Picture 13). \n Image 12 Source: https://bit.ly/2SVdmAB \n Image 13 Source: https://bit.ly/2sFyyjF  9. Augmented Reality: * For example, in a shopping mall, National Geographic installs an augmented reality system. The participants have to do certain simple actions so that the animals that are projected appear reproduced (https://bit.ly/39J2D26).  10. Immediate Interactivity: * When the user performs a simple action, the device reacts accordingly and so on in loops of successive simple actions of the same type. For example, in the interactive showcase where the user moves or touches \n 232 in a specific place and there is a reaction of the device (interactive display window) (https://bit.ly/2QMQyAn; https://bit.ly/2tzqXTS).   3.3. Interactive or Actional Intermediate Advertising Interactive or Actional Intermediate Advertising requests the subject to perform two or more interactive actions. - Three advertising modalities can be distinguished: 1. Participation in virtual worlds; 2. Interactive Internet; 3. Intermediate actions. - It takes place in a mediated time from the moment of beginning the interaction with the advertising stimulus. The duration of this interactivity can last for a few minutes, an hour or several periods during a day or, finally, a few minutes for several days. - The relationship mode is a secondary or mediate interactivity. This means that there is an alternation between an output of the interactive advertising system and a user response adapted to the advertising stimulus. Each response of the user, and depending on it, produces a new advertising stimulus that requires a new response from the user and so on until reaching the expected result by the user. - This form of interactivity requires the subject to process and activate various actions that are linked together and form an articulated whole. Unlike the type of reactive advertising, where only one type of simple action is requested, mediated advertising requests different types of actions from the user that are characterized because he also has available in his memory, prior to contact and interaction with the advertising of this third level, the cognitive skills that allow him to execute the actions. As illustrated in the following examples, actions can be performed by interacting with a technological device or by physical actions of the participant. In all of them, the different actions are chained together to achieve some kind of objective and/or reward.  Here are some examples: 1. Participation in Virtual Worlds: There are several types of virtual worlds. Here are some examples: * One is the case of CSI in Second Life / Sansar where the participant chooses an avatar and develops numerous social actions and exchanges in that virtual world (https://bit.ly/39L72Sz; https://bit.ly/35lARp3; https://bit.ly/2QPB1jk; https://bit.ly/2MWu0w4; https://bit.ly/2FozBa8; https://bit.ly/2MY94EX; https://bit.ly/2ZS89ei). * Another example is the campaign of the Argentinean telephone company Arnet. Over several weeks, a series of videos appear in which the protagonist, a young bald man named Juan Manuel Fraga, unknown at the time, claims that for every subscription to Arnet he will be able to have a hair implanted in his head. As a new video appeared, the story evolved. Many people were waiting for the new video. In Argentina, a whole current of opinion was generated in blogs and social networks in favor and against this character that became a very popular character who was invited to TV sets, appeared in TV shows and printed publications. One day it was revealed that Juan Manuel did not exist. He was an invented character whose role was played by this young unknown actor. An interesting viral movement had been generated and the campaign was a success for the company. The participants had chained a series of actions over time by searching for the videos, commenting on them on social networks; searching for other information in opinion media; etc. (https://bit.ly/39QgSm6; https://bit.ly/37H8ZgD; https://bit.ly/2ZWKE46) It may appear that the interactivity of this level III depends exclusively on new technologies. However, from the point of view of the psychological mechanisms activated in the subject, another type of interactivity fulfills the same functions of anchoring in the mind through mediate interactive actions. Here are two examples: * The participants are in a bar with a companion and are offered to compete for a prize. They have to carry out several successive tests: Running out of the bar with a ball without warning their companion; finding a street; once in it, adequately justifying their sudden exit from the bar to their girlfriend by phone; marking a penalty (https://bit.ly/2T5nUNZ). Let's look at some additional examples: * IKEA Place creates an app that allows the user to virtually furnish their home (https://bit.ly/2umMEXB).  233 * A free Smartphone and Tablet game that promotes the animated film The Minions in such a way that the user enters and moves around in that virtual world, where brands are present (https://bit.ly/2SRSHgO).  2. Interactive Internet: Here there are also different types of interactive internet devices. * The participant downloads the free application VW Real Racing GTI iPhone, chooses and configures his car model. Then he or she participates in a race and, finally, he or she can download the videos of the games and exchange messages with other riders (https://bit.ly/2ty2IVO; https://bit.ly/2STQUYL) * In the hashtag #Polowers, participants compete in a VW-Polo race on Twitter. The runner who makes the last tweet wins, therefore the participants must be attentive to what other participants do and respond quickly. You have to maintain this activity throughout the race that can last several hours. The campaign generated more than 150,000 tweets in the 8 hours after its launch and managed to impact more than 10% of the total Twitter audience in Spain, in addition to leading the Top 10 trending topics (https://bit.ly/2FlnZoD; https://bit.ly/35siGy0). * This brand of Turkish cookies launched an advergame in which players embody a cookie inventor whose mission is to save the future of their products from an alien threat. All Instagram features are used to create the experience. The mix of different game styles, along with the possibility of 17 different endings, were the keys to achieving an 850% growth in followers of the brand (https://bit.ly/2sRDIsC; another example with Magnum-Pleasure- Hunt at https://bit.ly/2QGPduQ).  3. Intermediate Actions: Since it is about chaining and coordinating a set of actions distributed over several days or weeks, the user must keep active the purpose of their actions. This makes that the links with the brand are reinforced. Two examples: * The neighbors of a neighborhood are invited to keep and use several weeks later, on the first day of the year, a very special garbage bag in which to throw the worst of the year. Words such as unemployment, crisis, etc. are written on the bags. (https://bit.ly/39Is1W0). * The participant downloads an app Equal HouseWork from Samsung and this helps him to become aware of the balance in the distribution of tasks at home (https://bit.ly/39zvXbo).  3.4. Planned advertising or Far Actional Advertising Planned advertising, or far actional advertising, corresponds to certain forms of advanced interactivity that require planned actions such as those in which the prosumer intervenes or in personalization situations (customize). The features that characterize it are: -Among its advertising modalities, we find the user's participation in advertising contests. These require planning and creative actions by the participant. The figure of the prosumer, when performing real creative processes, falls into this advertising category. - They develop in a prolonged time; several performances spaced in the mediate and distant time. User activity requires their participation in the advertising device for hours over several days or weeks. - A complex relationship mode takes place that introduces advanced interactivity. Unlike what happened in mediated publicity advertising, now the user has to perform creative or/and planned actions that are not available in his memory prior to coming into contact with the stimuli and tasks demanded by this sort of planned advertising. - The user must use all the processing mechanisms of the three previous types of advertising and must add creative planned actions that require complex mental activities (organization, anticipation, evaluation, reasoning, creation, imagination and fantasy), executive decision-making and actions effective. This processing also takes place in advanced interactive environments with multimedia and hypermedia devices. Examples:    234 1. Contests and Forms of Advanced Interactivity: * A first example of advanced interactivity is the Heineken campaign and the movie Skyfall (James Bond) that includes three kind of actions: spots, videogames / contest and events (https://bit.ly/2QLqgic; https: // bit .ly / 2ZZFjZO; https://bit.ly/2QIEPD2). Following the recreation of the film, in some of the ads there is a story to which people are invited to participate in the video game and in a contest. The participant must register on Facebook becoming a detective who has to solve a case. To do this you have to find the case combination. In Spain, 3,000 participants searched, through different Spanish cities, for clues to find a briefcase in important monuments. The seven finalists later participated in an event in Atocha (Madrid), where they had to find the final key to open the briefcase. The winner received an award. The participant in this long experience has to activate numerous processes and mental skills (reasoning, imagination, understanding ...) as well as search and execution actions during several weeks. The result is uncertain and many fail to solve the necessary clues. In other campaigns, such as \u201ccatchers\u201d, there is an initial question (what are \u201ccatchers\u201d) and, from that intrigue, the participant will follow the plot in a complex tour for several weeks (https://bit.ly/2MYj29f)  * A different example is one in which the participant must necessarily use creative mental processes. For example, Coca-Cola launches a challenge in which participants have to create a song. This implies not only carrying out a whole series of chained actions (meeting, singing and recording, etc.) but above all generating a creative process in which the functions of imagination and fantasy put all the higher mental functions (language, understanding, decision-making, etc.) and emotional functions at their service (https://bit.ly/2MVf4y4). * Some brands launch competitions in which participants must carry out creative activities, which implies starting complex mental processes. For example, a contest to draw cookies (https://bit.ly/2ZWSqe3), design your own label on a container (https://bit.ly/2FmxHXJ) or create a video and upload it to the platform to try to make the character laugh(Tony the Wall) (https://bit.ly/2MVlpJY).  2. Prosumer:  This type of creative process is present in the campaigns in which the consumer/prosumer participates in creating the product (customize). One of the first examples was initiated by Nike shoes (https://bit.ly/2QnEbf8) and then many examples have followed [designing bottles (https://bit.ly/36snox4; https://bit.ly/2ZScUEG), customizing cars (https://bit.ly/37BbReZ), bags (https://bit.ly/2Qs2bxC) or cookies (https://bit.ly/2tu4x6g)]. In all these cases, the participants not only have to create (and, in this way, generate new responses that do not exist before the campaign), but their creation is also the result of the participation of both cognitive functions (language, reasoning, etc.) and affective functions, where the creation relates the participant's own personality to the product.  4. Discussion and Conclusions  The results of this research have allowed us to show the changes that have taken place in the four traits that identify a persuasive advertising strategy and, based on that analysis, the presence of four types of strategies in the current advertising system. This affirmative answer to the five hypotheses formulated raises the question of the possible relationship between these different persuasive strategies. From a theoretical point of view, the results find their interpretation in the theory of processing levels and allow it to be extended to the field of advertising. The theory of processing levels describes the dynamic processes of coding and recall (Craik & Lockhart, 1972, Bermejo-Berros, 2017; Craik, 2020). The degree of recovery of information from memory depends on the type and level of processing with which it was encoded. This process of assimilation of the stimulus can occur, either superficially (for example, process some physical features of the stimulus), or in a semantic and deeper way (for example, the understanding of its properties, putting it in relation to other previous knowledge, etc.). The results of this research show that, as we move from level I to level IV (see Table 1), the degree of processing increases because the opportunity and contextual requirements for coding increase (due to the time of exposure to the stimulus and the duration in the working memory; due to the increase in the number of actions to be performed and their complexity). We have to keep in mind that advertising continues to pretend today that consumers retain their brand, their advertising promise and have a positive experience with it. Therefore, what the new persuasive advertising strategies found in this research show is that, the advertising purposes just mentioned, are reinforced with these new strategies because they induce deeper levels of advertising message  235 processing. In other words, current advertising, by introducing new persuasive strategies, increases its degree of efficiency by installing more deeply in the experience and memory of the consumer and user. In short, the results of this research indicate that changes in advertising communication have also modified current persuasive strategies. These are integrated into a combined communication system, which includes advertising pieces and marketing actions. This system has four properties that allow defining the Model of Advertising Message Processing Levels that results from this study: 1. Diversification of persuasive strategies. There has been a process of differentiation in the persuasive model of advertising of the twentieth century. According to the analysis carried out, a diversification of persuasive strategies has taken place. We have gone from one to four types of persuasive strategies (from level I to levels I, II, III and IV according to Table 1). 2. Levels of processing. The new persuasive strategies are not only different ways of addressing the consumer, but they are articulated among themselves in an advertising system that introduces four levels, which require an interactive participation of users progressively more demanding as we move from level I to IV (Cf. Table 1). In this process, the recipient is changed from a receiver to an interactive user. Between level I and IV, the user is induced to mobilize a greater number of mental resources and more varied than in classical advertising, where a first-level processing mode (i.e., merely attentional and perceptive) was used above all. The mental mechanisms mobilized by the advertising stimulus can affect one or more cognitive and emotional processes (attend, perceive, understand, understand, imagine, learn, act immediately, act in the medium term, plan, etc.). In correspondence with the theory of psychological processing levels (Author, 2017) and taking into account that the greater the cognitive processing of the stimulus the greater the assimilation and mental storage, it can be postulated that numerous persuasive strategies, particularly those close to level IV, induce greater levels of advertising effectiveness. Therefore, firstly, in the Model of Advertising Message Processing Levels four structures are identified that have their own epistemic identity (I, II, III, and IV). Each of these is the result of the concrete implementation in each advertising piece of four features or components (whose relevance to identify the persuasive structure had not been identified by any previous work). These components are articulated in an integrative unit that is not the result of the mere sum of the four components, but they work together within that overall structure (Gestalt). A second property of the Model is that there is a staggered relationship between the structures of the four levels I, II, III and IV, so that the level of pragmatic demand for psychological processing (cognitive-emotional and behavioural) increases from Level I and is highest at Level IV. 3. Types of advertising. Together with direct or interpellative advertising, characteristic of the advertising of the 20th century, we now find forms of indirect or masked advertising, very present in the new advertising strategies of the 21st century (Cf. Figures 1 and 2). If, during the twentieth century, direct advertising was inserted in the media, clearly differentiated, with codes that consumers learn to identify; now advertising is also found in other social contexts outside the media. Direct or interpellative advertising uses persuasive push-type strategies, according to which the advertising message is pushed towards the consumer. The strategy is direct because it aims at attracting the person to an advertising message by drawing their attention to it in order to convey the message in a conscious way (Cf. Figure 1). The receiver knows that the message he receives is advertising.  Figure 1. Direct advertising strategy (push) during the 20th century \n Source: Own elaboration  \n 236 Now, in the 21st century, the pull strategy is multiplied with indirect or masked advertising inside the media product. As illustrated in Figure 2, there are four successive steps. (1) At first, media content seeks to attract the consumer (e.g. to provide him with information likely to interest him or, in other cases, to entertain him). This is something that has value in itself for the person. (2) In response to the above, the recipient may be attracted to that product and decide to start consuming it. (3) Third, while the person is assimilating information or entertainment content, advertising is present and is susceptible to influence the consumer. (4) If the recipient has favorably evaluated the product, they will circulate it in a viral process through their contacts, social networks, etc. We see that, through this process, advertising actions use multiple screens, looking for the consumer to enroll them in a network of social actions and relationships (virality, etc.). All this in a context of cognitive hyperstimulation with advertising stimuli of a hypermedia nature. Figure 2. Indirect advertising strategy (pull) during the 21st century \n Source: Own elaboration  Pull advertising strategies are very present in the new advertising strategies, at any of the four levels of processing. 4. Circulation of advertising. Advertising no longer exerts its influence exclusively from the media, but we find many of its manifestations outside the media in a culture of entertainment and emotional relationship with the product through messages that insert advertising within itself (as in advertainment, branded entertainment and branded content). We find enigmatic, fun or surprising actions that, rather than informing about the product, what they want is to entertain and amuse. This is an indirect form of persuasion. The message is no longer exclusively an advertising message, with a defined genre, but advertising is mixed, hybridized, with other entertainment genres. At the same time, the barriers that had been established between advertising and different forms of marketing such as Street marketing, viral marketing, stealth marketing, engagement marketing, buzz marketing, etc., are removed, forming an integrated communication process. In conclusion, it can be said that, compared to classical advertising, current advertising has changed the ways in which advertisers relate to their target audience by introducing new persuasive strategies that induce deeper levels of processing of advertising information, from the point of view of the psychological processes activated during advertising communication. It is no longer just about capturing your attention but also that you do some concrete action, get involved in complex behaviors, and participate in creative activities. All this is for the benefit of the advertiser because, the greater the participation of the user, the greater the depth in the processing of the advertising information and, consequently, greater storage in the memory of the advertising message. At the same time, and not less important, given that in these pull strategies user participation is voluntary (particularly from level II), their emotional availability towards the advertising action is greater and, consequently, the emotional transfer towards the brand/product is more favourable. In short, these new persuasive strategies not only seek cognitive processing of the advertising stimulus but also, and particularly, establish an emotional relationship with the brand. Cognition and emotion now participate, in an intimate and solidary way, in the consumer's response to the advertiser's \n 237 new relational strategies, without this process of associating cognition and emotion being carried out through procedures, in a certain artificial sense, of association by classical conditioning through repeated exposure to the advertising stimulus in the media, as had been done throughout the 20th century. Now, in the 21st century, through these new persuasive strategies, we are witnessing a social phenomenon of influence by masking where advertising no longer tries to draw our conscious attention to its product/brand but to involve us in an activity that is attractive to us in which the brand and its values are only incidentally present. There is thus an involuntary cognitive and emotional processing of advertising which, by avoiding consumer counter-argumentation, increases the effectiveness of this phenomenon of social influence of advertising through entertainment and voluntary personal involvement. The analysis model that we have implemented, based on the research gathered in the present work, has allowed us to show the change in the persuasive strategies of advertising in the 21st century, focusing on the mental processes that are triggered in the consumer as Response to different types of advertising messages. This model completes and complements other visions about the present, and future trends (Kumar and Gupta, 2016; Deuze, 2016; Schultz, 2016), of persuasive advertising strategies.  4.

Consumers perceive influencers' recommendations as more trustworthy, less commercial, and more natural than traditional digital advertising. An experiment was carried out employing the Sociograph neuromarketing technique to assess its effectiveness on teenagers. This instrument measured the electrodermal level of the sample watching videos. Traditional spots and other types of influencers' advertising content were compared to measure the attention and emotional levels in a sample of 19 girls aged from 11 to 16. The experiment was conducted in a laboratory at the Complutense University of Madrid in June 2019 and was followed up by a post-visualisation survey. The results show that the videos showing influencers' content are those generating the most attention peaks. One of the influencers' branded content was also the video creating the greatest peak of emotion and perceived as the most exciting video out of all those analysed. This exploratory study also revealed that influencers' credibility and prior brand-awareness knowledge could also have an influence in positive perception of the videos and the brand.  La publicidad de influencers es un formato publicitario que se considera muy eficaz en la pr\u00e1ctica empresarial y acad\u00e9mica. El consumidor lo percibe como un contenido m\u00e1s cre\u00edble, menos publicitario y m\u00e1s natural que un formato publicitario tradicional. Para medir su efectividad en adolescentes se ha realizado un experimento exploratorio a trav\u00e9s de la herramienta de neuromarketing Sociograph que mide la actividad electrod\u00e9rmica. Se compar\u00f3 diferentes tipos de contenidos publicitarios protagonizados por influencers con spots publicitarios tradicionales midiendo el nivel de atenci\u00f3n y emoci\u00f3n que provocaban al ser visualizados. Se combin\u00f3 con una encuesta post visualizaci\u00f3n. La muestra constaba de 19 ni\u00f1as de 11 a 16 a\u00f1os. Se realiz\u00f3 en un laboratorio de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid en Junio de 2019. De los diferentes tipos de est\u00edmulos analizados, los contenidos protagonizados por influencers son los que m\u00e1s picos de atenci\u00f3n generaron. Uno de los branded content de influencers tambi\u00e9n fue el video que mayor pico de emoci\u00f3n gener\u00f3 y el video que m\u00e1s emocion\u00f3 a la muestra de todos los visualizados. Este estudio exploratorio parece indicar que la credibilidad de los influencers y el conocimiento previo de la marca tambi\u00e9n podr\u00edan afectar a la percepci\u00f3n positiva del anuncio.

Introduction  In recent years digital advertising has evolved in leaps and bounds and encouraged the apparition of new advertising formats. Within these new formats we can find influencer advertising or marketing, which has surged since professionals consider it to be more effective. It has been calculated that investment in influencers in 2019 was 100 million euros, three times more than in 2018 (Marketing Directo, 2019) and growth perspectives for 2020 show investment will grow to 170 million euros (ElConfidencial.com, 2019).  1.1. Background to the influencer phenomenon: definition of opinion leader concept The term \u201cinfluencer\u201d originated in the opinion leader. Although in the first half of the XX century the media was deemed to have a directly influence on individuals, Katz and Lazarfeld discovered that it wasn\u00b4t actually direct, but that opinion leaders really moulded messages from mass media and conveyed them to the general public by word of mouth (Sandoval, 2013). In the sixties, in sociology and social psychology, the motivations and characteristics of those individuals who were able to influence others began to be analysed. Rogers and Cartano (1962: 435) defined opinion leaders as \u201cindividuals who have a disproportionate amount of influence on the decisions of others\u201d. The social psychologist Edwin Hollander (1961, cited in Huffaker, 2010) deemed opinion leaders to be people capable of influencing the attitudes and behaviour of others and gaining a great following who believed all what they were being told. In the last few decades, studies on opinion leaders have also analysed how they influenced decision taking or how they broaden acceptance of new products (Casal\u00f3, Flavi\u00e1n and Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez S\u00e1nchez, 2018). The dawn of the Internet age brought new tools for multiplying the influencer network, which gave rise to new types of digital opinion leaders with their own characteristics. Huffaker (2010) explains that digital opinion leaders have a much greater role within the community of other individuals, are more credible, receive more attention on the Internet, use affection and assertion and manipulate the language in their messages in order to engage better with other individuals. This author states that to make up for the lack of body language, other cues were added such as frequency of contribution within the online community. Others such as Lyons and Henderson (2005) consider a lasting involvement or enthusiasm in the community is an important factor in the credibility of the opinion leader in this environment. A highly interconnected and broad network of connections are other key features, since this way, they manage to disseminate their message to a wide-ranging number of people (Weimann, 1994; Goldenberg, Lehmann, Shidlovski and Barak, 2006).   1.2. Influencers: Definitions and features Influencers share the same features as opinion leaders although they have others too, since they have sprung from a completely digital environment and focus on endorsing products or services. The International Advertising Bureau (IAB), defines them thus: Influencers are those people considered to have the potential to create engagement, drive conversations and/or influence the decisions of targets to purchase products/ services. These individuals may vary from celebrities to those who are less well-known by the public in general, but who are recognised in their own more specialized niches (2019a: 6). One of the differentiating elements of influencers is they act as a reference group which can be understood as \u201can individual or group of people which act as a reference to an individual in the formation of values and attitudes, and on doing so, also becomes a reference in their purchasing decisions\u201d (Schiffman, Hansen and Kanuk, 2012, cited in Djafarova and Rushworth, 2017: 2).  Influencers are not only able to influence a certain message or product, but they also become role models themselves for their fans to follow, especially the youngest ones. In this respect, influencers resemble celebrities in so far as both are role models and brands use them to convey the positive attributes of their products (Brison, Byon and Baker, 2016).  Another feature, which most sets influencers apart, is they are digital natives. They have grown up with social networks, although subsequently some of them have become public figures. They are not known for any previous trade, but became famous by sharing their experiences on these channels and, the most famous of them changed trade due to their fame as influencers. They are classified according to the main social networks on which they carry out their activity (although they are on other social networks too, they will always define themselves by their main one). Influencers can be bloggers (blogs), Twitterers (Twitter), Instagrammers (Instagram), Youtubers (Youtube) or Tiktokers (Tik Tok)(IAB, 2019a). Likewise, they  243 are also classified by the number of followers they have on their channel and this range goes from top influencers, macro influencers, average influencers, microinfluencers or nanoinfluencers (IAB, 2019a). Lastly, another feature of influencers is their specialization in a field of knowledge, with which they stand out as experts and leaders on these topics. In this respect, we can find influencers specialized in video games, gastronomy, beauty, gardening or ecology. In any field you can find influencers for different channels (eg. within the beauty category, there can be Instagrammers or Youtubers).   1.3. The advertising effectiveness of influencers The effectiveness of advertising consists in the capacity of the advertisement to create or produce a change in attitude in the consumer towards the advertised product in order for him or her to consider buying it (S\u00e1nchez, 2017). According to this author, if the advertisement is effective, the advertising message will have two types of effects: mediating and final effects. Mediating effects are those that give rise to changes in attitudes in consumers towards the product such as in their perception of it or whether they have a positive opinion about the product or not. The final effects produce a more direct response to the purchase, such as trying out this product, finally choosing the brand or repeatedly purchasing it. Although the body of knowledge on influencers is still limited in this field, we can find a more extensive one about the effectiveness of social networks. In these studies, advertising effectiveness is understood to be when social networks positively affect the product purchasing process, whether this is with mediating effects or the previously stated final effects. ln the theoretical review by Alalwan, Rana, Dwivedi, and Algharabat (2017) various studies have been analysed in which the advertising effectiveness of the social networks was demonstrated to be more effective at publicising new products, and to have greater capacity for changing opinions, perceptions or eliciting positive attitudes about a product, or they could change the purchasing intention of the consumer (Djafarova and Rushworth, 2017; Brison et al., 2016; Taylor, Lewin and Strutton, 2011; Chang, Chen and Tan, 2012). Advertising is so effective on social networks because it is far more believable than traditional advertising (Saxena and Khanna, 2013) and has a more profound effect on the consumer as a greater connection or engagement with the brand is created, whether this is because the consumer considers the people or entities who endorse the product to be much more believable than those in traditional advertising or because the user can identify more with these brands when this more innovative type of advertising is used (Lee, Hosanagar, and Nair, 2018; Wang and Hung, 2018; Kumar, Bezawada, Rishika, Janakiraman and Kannan, 2016). As for recommendations from influencers, in recent studies this type of advertising was deemed to be more effective as consumers found it more engaging because with influencer endorsements, contents were seen as being more authentic and original (Tur Vi\u00f1es, N\u00fa\u00f1ez G\u00f3mez and Gonz\u00e1lez R\u00edo, 2018; Casal\u00f3 et al., 2018) or because they could convey the advertising message in a way that was more natural and believable in comparison to that by celebrities (Casal\u00f3 et al., 2018).  Another branch of the body of knowledge on this topic analyses advertising efficiency from the perspective of the message and the elements which make consumers change their attitude, perception, opinion or purchasing intention after having seen an advertisement. The most used variables are the creativity of the advertisement, the capacity of informing or entertaining and how emotionally attractive it is (Lee and Hong, 2016; Taylor et al., 2011; Ducoffe, 1996). Lee and Hong (2016) described emotional attraction as the capacity of creating an emotional response in the consumer who views the advertisement. Emotion (whether it is positive or negative) makes processing the advertising message more superficial and our brain internalises the persuasive message, putting up fewer cognitive barriers against it (Petty and Cacioppo, 1986). Lee and Hong (2016) reviewed the body of knowledge on this topic and confirmed that advertisements with high emotional attraction were shared more online, and elicited greater word of mouth as well as a more positive attitude towards them. The capacity an advertisement has to inform has also been demonstrated to be an important factor in gaining the attention of consumers and motivating them to see the product in a positive light (Taylor et al., 2011; Lee and Hong, 2016). In this respect, if the advertisement is capable of attracting the attention of the consumer and/or creating an emotion in the subject, it will be more likely be effective in terms of creating a positive image and opinion about the product. In the field of influencer advertising, some new studies on neuromarketing and influencers have also identified advertising effectiveness as being the capacity to capture more attention, or according to its emotional intensity. Moreover, a recent study by the neuromarketing consultancy, Neuroinsight (2019, cited in Droesch, 2019) demonstrated that influencer advertising created 277% more emotional intensity than television advertising and 87% more memories of the advertisement. These influencer advertisements were also compared with advertising of other types of contents on Facebook and Youtube and also confirmed that influencer advertising was the most effective.   244 1.4. Influencer advertising as covert advertising Influencers arose from the need to make more sincere communications and engage with the consumer in a more natural way. At first, they called themselves impartial endorsers who were just guided by their tastes or personal criteria (D\u00edaz, 2017). For instance, if a brand treated them to a trip or gave them a product, they were under no obligation to talk about it, and they only did so if the product or brand was in tune with their lifestyle. However, influencers nowadays are professionals and the vast majority of their recommendations are paid for with money and/or in kind. The study made by the influencer agency Brand Manic (2018) showed that in 2018, 69.4% of the activities of influencers were paid for and 30.6% of them were given packs of products or samples. Even in such regulated sectors as child advertising there are clear indications that endorsements by Youtubers for toys (Tur Vi\u00f1es, N\u00fa\u00f1ez G\u00f3mez and Mart\u00ednez Pastor, 2019) or even unboxing in which children open toys and explain their contents (Craig and Cunningham, 2017) are advertising partnerships which have not been identified as such.  Therefore, is influencer advertising in reality covert advertising? It is only covert advertising when contents are not identified as advertising. When an influencer or celebrity does work for a brand and explicitly identifies it as advertising, this is called promoted content (IAB, 2015) although other authors call this native advertising (Campbell, 2016). This concept resembles brand placement if we look at its definition: \u201cthe intentional incorporation of a brand within a vehicle for entertainment\u201d (Russell and Belch, 2005: 74) or it may be considered as the adaptation of televisual product placement to digital product placement or as a category of branded content, which is defined as \u201cthe creation of important, entertaining or interesting content, with a non-commercial appearance, created by a brand to create a following and to engage with them\u201d\t(IAB, 2009b).  Branded content as such is not defined on a regulatory level in our country. For this reason, IAB (2019b) considers other regulated formats such as product placements or contents promoted by influencers as types of branded content. Therefore, influencer advertising can be identified as a category of branded content when a brand pays for it. For advertising to be considered covert, article 26 in the Spanish law on unfair competition, defines it as such:  Unfair as in deceitful includes information in the media, communications for promoting a good or service, paying the business owner or professional for this promotion, without any clear specification in the contents or sounds and pictures which are clearly identifiable to the consumer or user that it is advertising contents (IAB 2015: 7).  Only those recommendations from influencers who receive payment and which are not clearly identified as advertising can be considered as covert advertising. Even so, this is typical in Spain and it has been estimated that 36% of influencers in Spain make covert advertising and over 60% of them think it does not irritate their followers (Sol\u00eds, 2020).  There are two fundamental reasons as to why brands and influencers prefer to hide the advertising purpose behind these types of contents: a) Negative impact on the perception of the brand: various studies have shown there to be a negative impact when the business relationship between the influencer and brand is revealed (Wojdynski, Evans and Hoy, 2016; Boerman, Van Reijmersdal and Neijens, 2012; Evans, Phua, Lim and Jun, 2017). The success of covert formats is precisely because they reduce the cues people identify as being advertising from their previous experiences with other formats and thereby increase the persuasive capacity of their messages, since people interiorise them, put up fewer rational barriers and process information by a peripheral route (Petty and Cacioppo, 1986).  b) Believability of message and/or author: the believability of advertising is defined as \u201cthe scope to which consumers perceive a stimulus about a brand as true and believable\u201d\t(MacKenzie and Lutz, 1989: 51).  In various studies, credibility on social networks is considered to be crucial to making messages go viral (Roy, Huh, Pfeuffer and Srivastava, 2017). Both confidence in the advertised brand (Bleier and Eisenbeiss, 2015) and the credibility of the person who transmits or spreads the message are important for it to be effective (Cho, Huh and Faber, 2014). If the follower of an influencer discovers any trick or insincerity in the endorsement, not only will there be a negative effect on the brand perception but also on the credibility of the influencer.     245 1.5. Neuromarketing as a study technique The most used methodologies in research on social networks, influencers and covert advertising on an international scale are surveys or questionnaires but also remarkable in recent years are experimental designs linked to a follow up survey (Alalwan, 2018) since the experiments enable the real conditions in which the user visualizes and perceives the contents to be simulated. In the United States experimental designs are a typical technique in social sciences, although in Spain they represent just 2.6% of the methodologies used in the last 25 years (Mart\u00ednez Nicol\u00e1s, Saperas and Carrasco, 2019).  As we saw previously, emotion is a key element for determining the possible effectiveness of advertising contents (Lee and Hong, 2016). More specifically, Torreblanca, Ju\u00e1rez, Sempere and Mengual (2012) established that the three fundamental variables of the cognitive process of a person who views an advertisement are attention, emotion and memory. These authors determined that if these variables could be measured, then the advertising efficiency of contents could be enhanced. Therefore, a neuromarketing technique was specifically chosen for measuring electrodermal activity. Bioelectric activity from the skin is highly sensitive to emotional and cognitive stimuli such as anxiety or stress and as a result it is one of the most used techniques in social sciences, thanks to the reliability and precision there is when measuring levels of attention and emotion with a given stimulus. This technique is used both for analysing advertising and communication (Tapia Frade, Mart\u00edn Guerra and Puente, 2016; Mart\u00ednez Herrador, Monge Benito and Valdunquillo Carl\u00f3n, 2012) and, in the field of psychiatry, for measuring anxiety or affectivity (Davidson, 2002).  In this study, a technology known as the Sociograph was used, which was patented by the University of Salamanca, to gauge electrodermic activity which measures the subconscious reactions of a group of people who are exposed to a spot or audiovisual content and thereby determines how effective the stimulus is in terms of the impact it has had on attention or the emotion produced. Sociograph registers the electrodermal activity of the group on tonic and phasic levels (EDLg \u2013\tEDRg). Thanks to the constant current method (Kiloohms measurements), this enables the level of cortical activity to be measured as well as emotional responses while subjects are viewing contents. Sociograph uses the exosomatic method for registering electrodermic activity, which has been contrasted in other studies (Aiger, Palac\u00edn and Cornejo, 2013) with which changes in the skin are measured when a small electrical current passes through it from the outside. With this the activity of subjects as a group can be measured. That is, the attention and emotional response of the group is integrated as the experimental activity is performed. This makes the tool very useful in social sciences for measuring the reaction of a group of individuals to different stimuli (Aiger et al., 2013). Using some wireless devices, the responses of the group of people exposed to the same stimulus can be measured. At the start of the experiment, a numbered bracelet was placed on each subject with a sensor on the finger to measure the responses. As seen in graphic 1, this is a fairly unintrusive device, which is comfortable for the subject, which increases its ecological validity.                \nGraphic 1: Image shows Sociograph technology  \n Source: Sociograph\t 246 Electrodermic activity is classified with three variables:  Tonic activity or EDL (electrodermal level): As indicated by (Tapia Frade et al., 2016: 77) \u201cEDL shows us base levels of activity with significant implication in attention processes. High levels of EDL indicate greater levels of activation-attention and, therefore, greater inclination to receiving, analysing and responding to information\u201d. According to these authors, EDL is one of the variables which is most helpful for approximations for measuring the attention concept since what this tool is measuring is agitation or any change in the users with the stimuli given (which would be their level of attention) and how the subjects react to these stimuli. Tonic activity (EDL) is measured using the sum of the electrodermic resistance in kiloohms for all participants. The less resistance there is in the exposed subject, the greater level of attention the subject will have. EDL is a series with a trend (strong correlation) and therefore, to calculate attention for any given spot, we will need to find the rate it changes between one spot and another. It is an absolute measurement because we measure the attention response of the group as a whole. Sociograph discerns the individual data, which is not shared by the whole group that the sample is made up of. Phasic activity or EDR (electrodermal response): phasic activity occurs when a triggering stimulus (here the audiovisual contents seen) produces a swift psychophysiological response in the subject. According to Mart\u00ednez Herrador et al. (2012: 55) \u201cit is fundamentally based on the well known orientation reflex. It is a good predictor of change after exposure to a stimulus and, therefore, it is one of the most used indications\".  It must be clarified that phasic activity does not distinguish whether emotion is positive or negative, but just shows physiological changes with the comparison of contents the subject sees. The EDR just tells us if the stimulus has caused an emotional impact. However, as we saw in Lee and Hong (2016), an increase in the emotional impact on the subject may help improve the effectiveness of the spot. To control this variable and any possible side effects, stimuli similar to those in the visualisation were used (in this case, advertising contents for the same type of product). Phasic activity (EDR) is a stationary or constant measurement which is calculated by taking the average of the registries for every second of the spot. The arithmetic average of dermoelectric resistance in kiloohms was used for all participants. The greater the measurement, the more emotion the subject felt.  Spontaneous activity: NSA (non specific activity) is \u201cthat non-specific psychophysiological activity which is not possible to attribute to a known trigger as its presentation is not controlled\u201d\t(Tapia Frade et al., 2016:78).  People react to stimuli to different psychophysiological degrees. \"They are situational responses which represent the rate or degree of activity of the subject, so the greater the NSA response, the greater the spontaneous activity of the subject. This may be considered as the noise in the data obtained\u201d\t(Tapia Frade et al., 2016: 78).  NSA is an intrinsic variable for each individual. As it is a subjective variable, other studies have made up for it with the global arithmetic average in order to subsequently discern it and disregard it. The Sociograph neuromarketing tool measures these parameters with a frequency of 36 inputs per second. However, to simplify both the information and the analysis process, just one data is provided per second, which is the result of focusing these 36 data per second by means of this arithemitic average.   1.6. Objectives and hypothesis In the theoretical review it was seen that although influencer advertising is a regulated activity, a high percentage of influencers do not disclose it is advertising or do so in a more subtle way. However, studies show its advertising effectiveness is precisely due to it being a less commercial and therefore a more believable format.  The difficulty of measuring influencer advertising is there are a multitude of ways of endorsing products and services. We can find posts from influencers who identify advertising contents with the hashtag #publi or also advertising spots which use influencers as actors. In these cases, the characteristics of the contents themselves (music, production, insertion of logotype and slogan, etc.) clearly show that it is advertising content. However, an influencer can also be the protagonist in branded content, such as a public report or video interview. In this case, there are certain elements which identify it as advertising content, but as we saw in its definition, it is not intended to look like advertising and therefore its persuasive character may be kept hidden, although this is legal. Among the most covert formats used by influencers are those which are not identified as advertising which have a more home-made look and are integrated into their channels. Even other types of contents such as live help videos for a party, competitions in which the  247 prizes are brand products, etc. are ones in which it is difficult to establish the business relationship of the influencer with the brand.  Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyse different types of influencer advertising and compare them in order to see how effective this type of advertising is for teenagers. For this purpose, two objectives were set: 1. Objective 1: to identify whether influencer-advertising contents are more effective (in terms of attracting the attention of the subject or eliciting a more intense emotional response) than other digital advertising contents such as advertising spots.  In order to test this objective, we set out two hypotheses:  a) Contents protagonised by influencers are those which attract most attention in comparison with traditional advertising spots without them. b) Contents protagonised by influencers are those which elicit most emotion in respect to traditional advertising spots without them. 2. Objective 2: to find out whether there are significant differences between the advertising formats of the influencers. The hypothesis set for this second objective were: a) Covert advertising formats (branded content or advertising unidentified as influencer advertising) are those which attract most attention in comparison with an advertising spot protagonised by an influencer.  b) Covert advertising formats are those which create most emotion in comparison with an advertising spot protagonised by an influencer.   2. Methodology An experimental design for neuromarketing measuring electrodermal activity was carried out together with a post visualisation survey. The experimental design provided data on the physiological reactions of the user when viewing, and thus gave us very accurate information about the real experience of a subject outside a laboratory. As this technique can only measure physical responses with stimuli, it was supplemented with a survey for corroborating the findings and by measuring other types of variables such as the perception of the advertisement or the degree of believability of the influencers.   2.1. Selection of the analysed contents To demonstrate the hypothesis set in this project, a laboratory session was made in which the participants were exposed to a sequence of videos on digital advertising contents while their physical responses for attention and emotion while viewing were measured with the Sociograph tool, after which they were given a follow up survey on the contents viewed.  As the phasic activity cannot distinguish if the reaction of the subject is a positive or negative emotion, a sequence of advertisements on the same topic was used to offset this effect. A sector of the perfume industry was selected as being one of those most used by the influencers, due to their endorsements and as it is an industry which has traditionally used celebrities to sell their products. This selection was carried out in three phases:  - An initial search was made with 60 campaigns protagonised by influencers for different types of perfumes over the previous year and a half before the experiment began and they were categorised by types of content. This period was established due to the difficulty of finding influencer campaigns since some formats were momentary or influencers deleted advertising contents when their contract expired. In order to gather contents these parameters were established: (1) that they were contents advertised on Youtube or Instagram, which are the most used social networks in the beauty sector, (2) contents for childrens\u00b4perfumes were excluded (eg Perfume Frozen) since they are very minority and not representative of the sector and (3) only contents from top influencers were selected who were well known in the sample selected, since the impact of the influencer on the perception or emotion of the user may vary significantly according to whether they are known or not. All the contents were recorded with a Quicktime screen recorder from a computer screen.  248 - For the final selection of brands in the study, 10 marketing experts in the perfume sector were consulted for them to select from the sample those brands that targeted young people and to help identify if the contents were covert or not. In this way, an even sample would be obtained, undesirable side effects would be controlled and we would be ensured that they were sufficiently important brands in the Spanish market.  The maximum duration of the advertising videos sequence was around 12 minutes so that the subjects would not lose concentration, so, final selection was conditioned by this time restriction. The definitive sample consisted of 16 audiovisual contents with duration of 12 minutes and 22 seconds: 8 contents protagonised by influencers (with different degrees of advertising identification) and 8 contents with a traditional digital advertising format in order to make a comparison.  \u2022 8 advertising spots, shared on social networks protagonised by actors (traditional advertising format). \u2022 2 advertising spots protagonised by influencers and shared on social networks (influencer format identified as advertising). \u2022 2 branded contents protagonised by influencers (covert advertising content). \u2022 4 contents without any express advertising intention identified protagonised by influencers: two from YouTube and two from Instagram Stories (format with more direct covert intention because there are no cues identifying advertising although there are clear signs of paid collaboration). These have a more home-made feel, according to the style of the influencer channel). All these contents contained elements which enabled them to be recognised as YouTube or Instagram videos, such as logotype, typography, icons, etc. etc. In graphics 2 to 5 an example of each type of content can be seen.                         \nGraphic 2: Spot perfume Amor Amor - Spot without influencer or celebrity  \nSource: Youtube\t\nGraphic 3: Spot perfume Halloween Sweet California - Spot with influencer   \nSource: Instagram\t 249                       2.2. Justification for sample  The experiment was made with a sample of 19 girls between 11 and 16 years old. Due to the novelty of the technique and the purpose of the research, an exploratory study was made to identify the most important elements of the phenomenon. Although the number of subjects in the experimental designs was far fewer than in the surveys, the exploratory nature of the experiment justified the number chosen.  The company Focus Castell\u00f3 was hired to select the participants. In the initial selection, criteria for validity and scientific quality were combined with exploratory questions in order to choose a group of teenagers who were fans of the influencers in the study, since to explore the degree of influence a celebrity had, the subject needed to be aware that the appearing person was someone famous. In order to make sure these exploratory questions did not have an indirect effect on the subsequent responses in the survey, the adolescents were asked if they knew the influencers and related celebrities which appeared in the advertisements, but no questions were asked about the brands shown so as not to influence their perception about them.  This age range was chosen because they were digital natives who consumed a great deal of contents from influencers and they were an audience which was far more vulnerable to the effects of influencers and covert advertising (Tur Vi\u00f1es et al., 2018). Nobody under 11 years old was selected as the contents in perfume advertisements contain certain topics and codes which may be incomprehensible to a very young audience. From 11 to 16 years old, this group starts to project their aspirations onto brands and role models, so the endorsement of an influencer may have a bearing on their purchasing process. The sample was totally female for two reasons: (1) to delimit the variables studied in the experiment and (2) to adapt the analysed contents, since perfume advertisements are mainly consumed by women.    \nGraphic 5: Instagram influencer Stories Angie Corine \u2013 Covert influencer contents with low level of editing   \n Fuente: Instagram\t\nGraphic 4: Interview with the influencer Mar\u00eda Pedraza - Branded content influencer with high level of editing  \n Source: Youtube\t\n 250 2.3. Execution of study The study was developed on 20th of June 2019 in a laboratory in the Faculty of Information Sciences at the Complutense University of Madrid in the afternoon so teenagers could attend.  The sample was gathered in a room that was specially prepared for performing the study correctly. As they came into the room, the Sociograph technicians put a bracelet around their non-dominant hand (bracelet and electrodermic activity meter on the finger to measure responses). 5 minutes were allocated for giving the participants instructions. Then, selection was carried out in various phases: a) It started with a preview to prepare them for the study. 7 minutes of contents were watched which were similar to the ones that would be analysed subsequently, but these preliminary measurements were not included in the analysis, since in the first few minutes, attention levels are unstable and the sample needed to relax and become used to the laboratory setting.  b) Next, without the sample noticing the difference between one block and another, the selected contents were viewed for the experiment, which had a total duration of around 12 minutes. Whilst the activity was underway, using Sociograph technology, the electrodermic activity of the participants was monitored to register the impact the contents had on them. c) Subsequently, a questionnaire was made on the videos watched. The bracelet number was registered to identify the Sociograph data with the questionnaire responses, but not the name or surname.  d) As the participants finished, the Sociograph technicians took the bracelets off the participants one by one and gave them their incentive before they were collected by their parents.   3. Results 3.1. Analysis of attention or EDL (electrodermal level) On the electrodermic level (EDL) lower levels of resistance are associated with a greater degree of attention and greater levels of resistance are associated with a lower degree of attention. Therefore, in order to show this data graphically and to better interpret them, the EDL series were inverted in the Excel graphs; in this way when the line rose with EDL graph time, it meant the attention level also rose and when it fell it meant there was a decrease in attention.             As we can see in graphic 6, there were several significant results: 1. The highest peaks in attention corresponded to three contents which were protagonised by influencers. These showed a higher level of attention than those registered for traditional spots. These contents were: branded content from the group Sweet California (perfume Halloween), content from the Youtuber Rebeca Stones (for the perfume Amor Amor) and content from the Instagrammer Angine Corine (perfume Halloween).   2. It must be stressed that these contents were covert advertising (branded content, and two posts with no express identification that it was advertising), in comparison with two spots protagonised by influencers or traditional spots. In the branded content of Sweet California, the influencers set a challenge by decorating Halloween bottles while they encourage their fans to join them in decorating and they talk \nGraphic 6: Attention level - EDL  \nSource: Created by author   251 about their childhood and tastes; the video by Rebeca Stones responds to 10 questions about love, and at the end of the Vblog she talks about her participation in an activity with the perfume Amor Amor by San Valent\u00edn and says what she likes about this perfume without mentioning advertising; the third content concerns some recommendations about Christmas gifts in which the influencer explains different Halloween perfumes and for which occasions she uses them, without mentioning these are paid for- and so these endorsements are not purely altruistic.   3.2. Rate of change in attention  Even if there was a very high peak in attention with the content, perhaps the advertisement as a whole may not have managed to keep the attention of the user in comparison with other contents. In order to compare the audiovisual contents and see which captures attention the most, the rate of change for each spot had to be calculated. Attention is a highly sensitive variable and average attention per spot could not be calculated but, rather, the trend in the level was observed. That is, whether during an advertisement it rose, fell, or remained constant. The advertisements which ended with a greater degree of attention than when they began were ones which were capable of engaging the users and, therefore, they were the most effective ones.   In order to calculate the rate of change, the following formula was used and calculated for each content viewed. Although we could not establish a meaningful pattern about what type of video most captured attention, we can see that in graph 7 two out of the three contents with the greatest rise in attention were protagonised by influencers.                 The content which most raised attention was the branded content from the group Sweet California, just like for the peaks in attention. The second most engaging content was an advertising spot protagonised by influencers. Here too, it was Sweet California with the perfume Halloween. The third content concerned a spot with perfume models Zadig & Voltaire, with many changes in shots, great speed, catchy music and modern female models. In this spot, although there was no significant peak in attention during viewing, when we calculated the rate of change we saw the sample began with a low level of \nGraphic 7: Average rate of change in EDL  \nSource: Created by author propia \nEDL Average rate of change \n= - 100 * \nEDL final \u2013 EDL initial EDL initial * Lenght   252 attention when the spot started, but the engaging quality of the advertisement meant this level gradually rose. Therefore, the rate of change was positive.  3.3. Emotional level or EDR (electrodermal response) Emotion was another of the key elements for measuring the influence of advertising contents on the consumer. As we can also see in graphic 8, 2 out of the three contents with the greatest peaks in attention were branded content from influencers.            The branded content by Mar\u00eda Pedraza for Yes I am, in which she is interviewed about her tastes and ends up showing the perfume at the end of the interview, is that which has the highest peak in emotion. The second concerns a traditional spot from the brand Benetton with many contrasting shots, very powerful music and vivid colours and the third content is, once again, the branded content of the influencers, Sweet California decorating bottles.   3.4. Rate of change in emotion  In order to measure the emotional impact of each content viewed, we needed to calculate average EDR, with this formula:     Here, we can see in graphic 9 that the content which created the most emotional response was branded content from the interview with Mar\u00eda Pedraza for the perfume Yes I am, although the next two most emotional contents were two traditional spots (from the Benetton and Zadig & Voltaire perfumes). However, it must be pointed out that branded content with less editing and narrative intensity than a television spot was that which created the most emotional response.             \nGraphic 8: Emotional level - EDR  \nSource: Created by author propia \nEDR Average = \nFinal  Initial \nLength  253                      3.5. Post experiment survey  After viewing, the subjects answered a brief survey on the contents watched and their perception of them and the protagonists in them.  In the question \"Out of all the videos you have seen, which ones have you liked the most?\" we found some responses which clashed with those obtained in the first part of the study. The two most liked contents did not stand out for the high level of attention given to them nor for the emotional response they received in the experiment (the spots by Amor Amor spot and Aitana perfumes). However, the third, fourth and fifth most liked contents were those which received the most emotional responses or peaks in emotion (the branded content of Mar\u00eda Pedraza for Yes I Am was the one which created the greatest amount of emotion, the Benetton spot came second and Yes I am was the fourth). Graphic 10: Response to the question, which contents did you like the most?

These results were explained on analysing the following responses from the survey:  a) Credibility of the influencer: In the survey the subjects were asked to evaluate on a scale from 1 to 10 how believable they found the influencers who appeared in the videos. The data obtained in this question shows Aitana as being the most believable influencer. This may explain why the Aitana spot appears in first place of preference in the surveys despite not being an attractive advertisement in terms of attention captured or emotional response. \nSource: Created by author aaauthor authorraci\u00f3n \nGraphic 9: Average EDR \n 254 We even saw that there was also a certain correlation between the believability of the influencer and the order of the most liked videos by the respondents. If we compare the order of believability from graphic 11 with the most liked videos from graphic 10, we can see that the order in which the influencers appear is exactly the same. Although this phenomenon could be mere chance, it might also shed light on how important the believability of the influencers is for the perception of a brand to change to a positive one, so in future more in-depth studies must be made in order to see whether there was a direct correlation or not.          b) Knowledge of a brand prior to the study: The subjects were asked which brands they knew before the study began, since, due to previous research, we know that this can be a factor which influences perception of the brand (G\u00f6bel, Meyer, Ramaseshan and Bartsch, 2017). As we can see in graphic 12, the most well-known brand in the survey was Amor Amor, one which also coincided with the most liked brand spot in graphic 10. Although the second most known brand (Tous Perfumes), did not score highly in terms of attention attracted, emotion responses or preferences in the study, it can be seen that the following brands that were most known by the respondents were related to the contents the sample most liked (the third most well known brand was the spot for Aitana perfumes and the fourth was the perfume Yes I am, which were the two most preferred contents.             Although the data was not consistent enough to establish a correlation, there were possible signs that there may have been some sort of relationship between previous knowledge of a brand and the positive attitude displayed towards these visualised brands. For Tous and Hollister brands (whose contents do not stand out for grabbing the attention or emotion of the spectators) this may be explained by the fact that it bore no relationship with the preference for the perfume video, since the \"parent\" brand is very well-known which might have lead the subjects to evaluate the fame of the jewellery or clothing brand, but not specifically the perfume. In this respect, it might be said that great knowledge about these two brands did not affect the preference of the videos for their perfumes. However we did see a relationship between knowledge of the brand Amor Amor or Yes I am or Aitana perfumes with the fact that these were the most liked videos by the teenagers.   \nGraphic 11: Degree of believability of influencer \nSource: Created by author \nGraphic 12: Percentage of previous knowledge about brand before the study \nSource: Created by the author  255 4. Discussion  The first objective set in this exploratory study was to identify whether the advertising contents of influencers were more effective (in terms of attracting the attention of the subject, creating an emotional response or producing a more positive perception in the subject) than other digital advertising contents such as advertising spots. To test this, the first hypothesis set was that the contents protagonised by influencers drew more attention than advertising spots without them. The data obtained in the exploratory experiment were indicative that contents from influencers were indeed those which created more peaks in attention with a young audience. When we observed each content as a unit of analysis and compared them, we could also see that the two which drew most attention were ones from influencers. In this respect, we could validate the first hypothesis. Although not all contents from influencers were those which drew most attention, we could see that those with most peaks in and greater rates of attention were ones they protagonised. The second hypothesis set was the contents protagonised by influencers were those which elicited the most emotional response in respect to advertising spots without them. In this case, the data obtained were not as categorical as those for attention, but we did find that two out of the first three contents with the highest peaks in emotion were from influencers. On comparing the contents viewed, the one which elicited most emotion was also protagonised by an influencer. In this respect, we could say the second hypothesis was partially validated, since the results were less categorical than those for attention.  The second objective of this exploratory study was to discover if there were significant differences between the alternative advertising formats of influencers. The first hypothesis set was to discover if covert advertising formats were those which received most attention in comparison with an advertising spot protagonised by an influencer. Here, we saw that the three most covert contents (branded content and two covert contents from influencers) were those which drew most attention in the whole sample analysed. \tOn comparing the different videos, we saw that the two contents, which attracted most attention, were branded content and a spot from influencers. These data seemed to indicate that the most covert contents did indeed generate greater levels of attention, thereby validating the hypothesis, but the data were not as robust as desired, so these findings would need to be revalidated in future studies.  The second hypothesis for objective 2 to be tested was whether the covert advertising formats were those which elicited most emotion in comparison with advertising spots by influencers. In this respect, the two branded contents of influencers were among the first three contents with peaks in emotion. When we compared the visualized contents, the one which elicited the most emotional response was the branded content from Mar\u00eda Pedraza for Yes I am, although the two following ones were traditional spots. In this respect, the hypothesis was validated. We were even able to take this a step further and discerned certain signs that the branded content of influencers elicited more emotion than did the posts of covert advertising by the influencers. However, these findings must be considered with caution, as this was merely an exploratory study.  It is highly striking that the contents with most peaks in attention and emotion were from influencers and were less commercial in nature (two of them were home-made by the influencers themselves) when execution and production of traditional spots is far more elaborate, expensive and designed to have a greater effect on the consumer. An advertising spot might be expected to capture attention or create emotion far more intensively than branded content or home-made posts by an influencer. However, the data seems to indicate that using these influencers and knowing how to integrate brands into their videos resonates more with teenagers. The three contents by influencers which created the greatest peaks in attention were some videos which were much longer than the spots, which belied the market trend in making ever shorter videos since young people supposedly have ever shorter concentration spans. However, it might be deduced that the story or narrative told by the influencers or the charisma or unique and distinguishing style they each have might have meant a longer video not only kept their audience engaged, but even created higher attention levels. The results seem to show that formats with a certain covert advertising purpose worked better for teenagers, since playful content predominated in them and so fewer mental barriers might have been put up when viewing them, as the contents were not interpreted as being persuasive.  So, could the attention or emotional response from content have a positive influence on the perception of teenagers towards the advertised brand? Firstly, it must be taken into account that Sociograph really measures physical attention or emotional reaction with a stimulus. The emotion measured by Sociograph does not correspond to taste or any potential positive perception of this stimulus. However, although there are different variables at play, the physical reactions caused by a stimulus and taste or opinions about it can indeed be related, as seen in the results. In this respect, it seems clear that attention does  256 not have an impact on the positive perception of the brand, at least not in the short-term. However, although the data was not robust enough to establish a direct correlation, it may be inferred that emotion may have had some influence on how positively the brands were perceived, since, although the two best evaluated spots by the teenagers were not those which were most attractive or emotive for young people, the following four most liked contents did correspond to those which were. As we said before, other factors such as previous knowledge about the brand or the believability of the influencer might have been determining factors in how positively the advertisements were perceived (which explains why the first two most liked contents by the teenagers were brands about which they had greater previous knowledge or with the most believable influencers). In this respect, the data obtained were very significant, since not only did they demonstrate that content from influencers may capture high levels of attention and elicit more emotion, but also that the use of influencers may be a highly determinant factor for increasing the positive perception of the advertisement and/or brand. We can see there is a certain relationship between how believable the influencers are and how positive the perception of the contents is, and so we can infer by this that using influencers with a high degree of credibility may lead to a more positive perception of the brand. A clear example of this is the spot by Aitana, which, although it did not elicit high levels of attention or emotion, there was a positive opinion about the perfume and the brand was well remembered.    5. Conclusions Although this is merely an exploratory study, this first contact has enabled us to gain an insight into the influencer phenomenon and to discover some key factors for explaining why they are considered to be more effective than more traditional advertising formats. Using influencers may increase engagement and the emotional response to the advertising contents. Moreover, formats which are less commercial-looking with influencers may be more effective than a traditional spot protagonised by an influencer. Curiously, intermediate formats, branded content, seemed to elicit more emotion than ones that are more covert and have a more home-made production style. These findings may be of great use for Spanish advertisers who may wish to use these new agents more effectively in their advertising contents.  The credibility of influencers in the positive perception of the brand they endorse was also a significant and salient finding. In this respect, a broader analysis on the characteristics of these influencers and how the degree of credibility affects advertising effectiveness would make a good topic for future research.  The data obtained must be corroborated and contrasted with other studies with a larger sample of teenagers, and other groups of subjects in order to see whether there are differences between ages or genders, when other research techniques are used. A more in-depth exploration will also be needed to see whether different types of formats protagonised by influencers make a difference in how brands are perceived. In this study, the immediate effect after viewing was measured, but it would be interesting to analyse the influence of endorsements by influencers in the short/long-term or on buying intention.   6.

Data provided by the WHO show there is a serious public health problem, being the second highest cause of death among young people aged between 15 and 29 at global level. On the other hand, the media rejects treating with suicide publicly because of the influence of the so-called Werther Effect, able to create a \u201cpull effect\u201d. However, a parallel theory named the Papageno Effect confirms that positive coverage of suicide in the media can help prevent it. The formulas employed in advertising coverage of a public interest issue can be revealed by means of a compilation of the main national campaigns and an analysis of the first prevention campaign in the Valencian Community. Future strategies include making the issue visible, raising awareness and education. Furthermore, expert opinion validates this approach and encourages visibility of the phenomenon so as to break the taboo, myths and stigma that surround suicide.  La presente investigaci\u00f3n trata de dar respuesta a las dudas que genera hablar del suicidio en los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, especialmente ante la escasez de campa\u00f1as sociales de prevenci\u00f3n en el panorama actual. Los datos ofrecidos por la OMS revelan que se trata de un grave problema de salud p\u00fablica, siendo la segunda causa de muerte en j\u00f3venes entre 15 y 29 a\u00f1os a nivel mundial. Por su parte, los medios muestran rechazo a la hora de tratarlo p\u00fablicamente debido a la influencia que ejerce el llamado efecto Werther, capaz de generar un efecto \u201cllamada\u201d. Sin embargo, una teor\u00eda paralela bajo el nombre de efecto Papageno corrobora que un tratamiento positivo del suicidio en los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n puede ayudar a su prevenci\u00f3n.

Introduction In order to discuss social advertising campaigns for the prevention of suicide, first of all they should be contextualised within the general framework of social communication campaigns. Communication through advertising has a social aspect with non-commercial aims which seek to produce effects that can contribute to social and/or human development and which may or may not form a part of programmes promoting change and social awareness (Alvarado, 2005; Mart\u00ednez y Vizca\u00edno, 2008). Thus any communication which seeks to contribute to social development on causes of social interest with non-commercial aims is considered to be social advertising. In spite of the antagonism that the concepts \u201cadvertising\u201d and \u201csocial\u201d may generate by being placed together, many researchers define a link between them which unites them within the sphere of advertising. Both aspects of communication share basic communicative features such as the persuasive purpose and their highly paid nature. The most differentiating point of social advertising is to be found in the source, for it has been developed by the advertisers from the social sector and, basically, by the so-called Third Sector which has used conventional means to be known by and to obtain a certain social recognition (Cort\u00e9s, 2008; Arroyo, 2009). In this way, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) use advertising as a promotional tool for social causes or for general interest in specific contexts. In parallel to this, and as professor Arroyo (2009) continues, we also find the so-called \u201cadvertising with a cause\u201d promoted by brand name companies in order to link socially positive ideas and values to their businesses. This trend is on the uprise; every day more and more advertising discourse crosses the traditional advertising rhetoric with the representation and utilization of social values and content, creating the so-called \u201cCorporate Activism\u201d, a corporate discourse which feeds on social values and attempts to change the traditional narratives in order to legitimise its image. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate social discourse from corporate discourse because of the overlap of the rhetoric traditionally used by each of them. But the key indicator for recognising a social campaign with no lucrative or commercial aim is to identify the source. If, as we have mentioned, an NGO is the promoter of the campaign then it is clearly intended to be a social campaign, even though it may include some aspects recognisable from commercial advertising. Nevertheless, there are social campaigns promoted by government entities whose source is clearly identified as a Public Administrations broadcast in different means of communication, in the spaces reserved for commercial advertising (Cort\u00e9s, 2011). The State communicates directly with the public through the channels of mass media, with a social message that should fulfil the features previously mentioned, thereby generating \u201cInstitutional Advertising\u201d.  1.1. Aims of the Research Stigmatising certain behaviour or conditions can be an incentive in some cases for the production of a greater number of publicity campaigns which try to eradicate or bring about awareness of them. Dealing with HIV or drug-taking is now taken for granted by society and by institutions, who broadcast social campaigns on these regularly. However, the stigma which suicide carries with it somehow impedes the production and broadcasting of such campaigns. Seeing the shortage of publicity campaigns for the prevention of suicide in the last decade in Spain raised the question as to whether the production of awareness campaigns about suicide could have a positive influence on its prevention and bring about a reduction, by treating it with a more normalising and general approach. The objectives for this research are as follows: \u2022 To determine the reasons given by institutions to explain the low number of social campaigns in this field. \u2022 To know the change in strategy regarding the treatment of suicide that the public institutions are adopting and its communication via publicity campaigns. \u2022 To propose an alternative communicative strategy for greater efficiency in the campaigns for the prevention of suicide.    263 2. Theoretical Framework 2.1 Institutional Communication The Institutional Publicity and Communication Law 29/2005, of the 29th December, defines institutional publicity and communication campaigns a \u201cany organised activity aimed at spreading a message or common objective to a wide range of recipients, which uses an advertising format paid for or granted and which is promoted or contracted by [\u2026] the General State Administration and by the other entities which make up the public sector\u201d. Likewise, the Valencian Government\u2019s Law 12/2018 of the 24th May which regulates institutional publicity of interest to the public and the collective ideas of the public infrastructures, defines in its Article 2 the broadcasting of institutional publicity as one to \u201cPromote attitudes and civic behaviour in citizens in relation to goods or public services of an educational, cultural, social, sanitary nature, promoting employment and other areas of equivalence\u201d, among others. Therefore, the State, or the Public Administrations are responsible for broadcasting educational and socializing campaigns for the citizens with the aim of introducing new values which can bring about changes in society (Cort\u00e9s, 2011), whether they be in perceptions or of attitudes. The matters that should be addressed through this type of communication are defined by the Secretary of State for Communication in the Practical Guide published in 2010, in which the information and socially useful campaigns which foster in citizens a social change of habits or attitude, as well as campaigns of support to the Spanish economic sectors and those which support public institutions, are all considered to be \u201cadvertisable\u201d.  2.1.1. Budget distribution for Institutional Publicity and Communication Every year the Ministry of the Presidency and Territorial Administrations publish a Plan for Institutional Publicity and Communication in which social priorities are described. For the year 2018, healthy habits, the promotion of citizens\u2019 rights and duties, and the development of technology occupy the top positions. Throughout the year, 39.22% of the campaigns had as their objective \u201cto advertise preventive measures against risks or which contribute to removing harm of any type for the health of the people or the natural heritage\u201d, to coincide with the priority of \u201cpromoting healthy habits\u201d. Certain matters such as \u201cinformation and creation of awareness for the prevention of gender violence\u201d, \u201cenergy saving and efficiency\u201d or \u201ccybersecurity for citizens and businesses\u201d (Plan 2018 for Institutional Publicity & Communication) form the major part of the advertising campaigns sent out during this year. While it is true that the Ministry for Health, Social Services and Equality receives a higher budget than other Ministries (13,441.237\u20ac in 2018), with a total of 13 annual national campaigns it is well behind others like the Home Office or the Ministry for Industry, Tourism and Commerce in the number of campaigns. Therefore, knowing the overall level of investment and distribution of funds for the different ministries\u2019 institutional campaigns, it is possible to see the importance attributed to each of them, placing health as the third cause with the greatest number of campaigns proposed, and in second place for the assignment of funding, in spite of being responsible for the first of the priorities defined by the 2018 Plan. At the regional level, we find the relevant information for the budgetary assignment in the Valencian Community Transparency Portal. The production of public assets of a social nature, in particular the Institutional Promotion and Communication, received 5.9 million Euros in 2018. This amount is not itemised or broken down, so it is not known which campaigns were carried out with these funds. Through the \u201cCall for Projects\u201d offered by the Valencian Government and open to professional agencies for the \u201cCampaign for the prevention of suicide\u201d the public were informed that \u201cThe budget for the development of this is 17,000\u20ac + VAT\u201d. Thus, at least, this quantity was invested in the creation, promotion and distribution of the project.  2.2 Suicide as a social phenomenon This study in no way attempts to understand the underlying causes of suicide, for to enter into its psychological, sociological and criminological depths would detract from the main focus of the research. Therefore, we shall proceed by explaining the classic concept of suicide in very broad terms, and the current contextual focus of suicide.  264 The World Health Organization (WHO) defines suicide as \u201cthe act of deliberately killing oneself\u201d. Tejedor (2010), as cited by Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez & Olmo (2015: 72), describes it as \u201cneglected death\u201d. In turn, Emil Durkheim, in his book Suicide (1992), defines it as \u201cthe act of desperation of a man who does not want to live\u201d (cited by Garc\u00eda-Sanmart\u00edn, 2018:455). However, suicide cannot be summarised simply as voluntarily depriving oneself of life. A whole range and number of factors come into play, whose origin can be found in and derive from everyday life and the cultural and historical surroundings of the individual (Garc\u00eda-Haro, Garc\u00eda-Pascual & Gonz\u00e1lez, 2018), which is why we can neither understand nor approach this phenomenon in the same way over different times or social contexts. In general, clinical psychology associates the origins of this phenomenon with depression, although they are not always directly related. There are an infinite number of \u201crisk factors\u201d that increase the level of risk of suicide, be they at an individual, family or contextual level (P\u00e9rez Barrero, 2005). Relevant factors range from mental disorders such as depression, bipolarity, psychotic disorders, anxiety, personality disorders, etc., even age and sex. It is worth noting that adolescence and old age are \u201cthe times with the greatest risk of attempts and success of suicide\u201d (Fern\u00e1ndez, 2016), being men who tend to attempt and succeed in the greater part of registered suicides, with a rate of 73.9% (National Institute of Statistics - INE). On the other hand, family history, a lack of social-family support, economic status, the employment situation or education are some of the most relevant environmental factors. Together with these, some important stressful events, sexual orientation, abuse or the \u201cWerther\u201d effect (pull effect) directly influence suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Without a doubt there are numerous cultural, social, psychological, clinical and biological factors (Garc\u00eda-Haro et. al., 2018) which directly impact on suicidal behaviour. In addition, according to the individual\u2019s age and specific circumstances, the factors can change and vary in risk. The lives of adolescents, adults and the elderly present very different conditions associated with each particular stage in life, yet they can coincide in the same result. Likewise, other collectives like lesbians, gays, transsexuals and bisexuals (LGTB) form part of the most \u201cvulnerable\u201d groups in society. In spite of the numerous causes, both individual and from the immediate surroundings, that are directly related with suicide, through his work Suicide (1897), the sociologist and philosopher \u00c9mile Durkheim (1858-1917) arrived at the following conclusion (cited by Felipe Palacio, 2010:6): suicide cases are not to be understood as isolated and private, but rather as a social trend in the so-called \u201csuicidogenic societies\u201d, in which suicide arises as a response to \u201can imbalance between social structure and cultural conscience\u201d. As such, he concludes that \u201call suicides in a given society [\u2026] are treated as a social fact that can only be explained sociologically, and not by the individual motivations that lead to suicide\u201d. Following Durkheim\u2019s theory on suicide and its classic understanding, Felipe Palacio (2010) makes reference to the three types of suicide determined by the French sociologist: \u201cegotistical suicide\u201d (he underlines individualism, like the Japanese harakiri), \u201caltruistic suicide\u201d (moral sacrifice for the collective good, like the kamikazes or immolations) and, lastly, \u201canomic suicide\u201d (generated by a lack of vitality or from individual disorientation). Therefore, there are so many variables which intervene in the process of this complex phenomenon of suicide and so many vulnerable groups that it is very complicated to identify an objectively specific type.  2.2.1. The statistics of suicide The WHO recognises suicide as \u201ca public health priority\u201d. The figures managed by the organisation rise to 800,000 deaths per year worldwide, and it is the second main cause of death in young people between the ages of 15 and 29. However, these figures may need modifying, given the questionable quality of the ways in which suicides are measured and deaths are recorded. In fact, the WHO considers that a very high proportion of suicides are wrongly classified as a result of the stigmatisation of the problem as a cause of death. In Spain, the figures handled by the INE (2017) show that in 2017, 3,679 deaths were recorded with suicide as the principle \u201cexternal cause\u201d with 10 deaths per day. Deaths from road accidents were a long way behind with 1,890 victims. That same year produced 397 suicides in the Valencian Regional Community (INE 2017), of which three out of four cases were male. This translates to almost one suicide per day, according to the Spanish Foundation for Mental Health through the Suicide Observatory in Spain. This positions the Valencian Community in fourth place for the number of suicides per year.  265 It is worth noting an article published in the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds in 2016, with data provided by the INE, which compared the number of suicides between the 1980s and the year 2014 with road accidents in the same period (Fonseca (2016). From the beginning of the first decade of the 21st century road accidents started to reduce in number progressively until the present time. In contrast, there has been a continuous increase in suicides, albeit with a more gradual rise but which have persisted throughout the years and are still increasing. 2008 is a key year for both; the number of road accident victims was overtaken by that of suicides by 427. In 2014, the difference is 2,037 deaths. The source of this situation can be directly associated with the change in mentality by Spanish society towards road safety as a result of the policies of awareness campaigns (Castell\u00f3, 2010; Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez & Olmo, 2014). Since 1966, the DGT (Directorate-General for Traffic) has broadcast campaigns on accident prevention relating to speed, alcohol, safety, cyclists, etc. The insistence and continuity of the campaigns and the Strategic Plans for Road Safety have achieved a reduction of 6,345 victims of traffic accidents. This data therefore leads us to question what measures have been taken in relation to suicide and its prevention, after such progress made in the rate of road accidents. Figure 1. Mortality comparison between road accidents and suicides                    Source: Fonseca, D. (2016). https://bit.ly/2HMqrpc  It is common to see news about road accidents and prevention, but not so about suicide or awareness campaigns. The question posed by Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez (2014) is that, as it is a social problem, why is there so little media coverage about it?  2.3 Communication on suicide and its stigmatisation. Having gone through the social communication campaigns sent out by the various Government Ministries, what stands out by their absence are institutional suicide prevention campaigns under the auspices of the \n 266 Health Ministry. In none of the Institutional Publicity and Communication plans broadcast by the Spanish Government is suicide treated as one of the primary targets of communication in a ten-year period (2007-2017). This sample reflects the absence of social campaigns aimed at the prevention of suicide, just as it is also a symptom of the stigma from which it suffers, often understood as \u201ca dysfunction, an outburst of human behaviour about which we only know how to feel compassion or repulsion\u201d (P\u00e9rez Jimenez 2011:13). This author points out that the degree of public ignorance about suicide is comparable to its importance as a matter for concern. Taking into account that suicide is a strongly stigmatized social phenomenon which is almost conceived of as \u201ctaboo\u201d, the treatment given to it in the media is reduced to representing it as an individual and anecdotal event (Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez & Olmo, 2015). Thus the information considered as newsworthy runs the risk of becoming of \u201cmorbid interest\u201d, focusing on details relating to the death, the method used, criminal facts, etc. The communication of suicide intrinsically incites a morbid interest in any case, for \u201cwhen a person seeks to end his/her life it ruptures the natural order of things, which creates a special interest for the public\u201d (Urz\u00faa, 2003:354). Recent years have shown a notable increase in concern for the prevention of suicide and the elimination of its status as taboo. However, each change in government has brought about substantial changes in the public treatment of the matter, for at both national and regional level strategic changes have been observed in the prevention of suicide. Nevertheless, Spain currently has no state plan or programme for prevention. What we do find is a proposal for a general strategy for the National Health System (SNS) where the prime objective is to raise awareness through social awareness and destigmatization campaigns on the problem of suicidal behaviour (Anse\u00e1n, 2014; Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez & Olmo, 2014). For its part, the Foundation for Mental Health in Spain (FSME) recognises a manifest disinterest on the part of politicians, who have restricted their interest to making proposals for laws yet have passed none. The judicial and legal system is an obstacle which holds back the creation of integral plans for the prevention of suicide in a combined and coordinated fashion. On the other hand, it is true that in recent years, especially in 2018, the Autonomous Regional Community governments have proposed initiatives to work with protocols for action at a local and regional level. Notable among these are the programmes from Galicia, Castilla-La Mancha, Murcia, Barcelona and Valencia. In spite of these regions having programmes of prevention of suicidal behaviour in which publicity is considered priority as a strategic line of prevention and a means for action, it has only been carried out in some cases.  2.3.1. The \u201cWerther\u201d effect. An explanation for the communicative silence can be found in the \u201cWerther Effect\u201d, proposed by the sociologist David Phillips in 1974, after proving that the number of suicides in the United States increased in the month following the front page publication of news of suicide (Herrera, Ures & Mart\u00ednez, 2015). This reflects what is known as the \u201cpull effect\u201d; a phenomenon which induces an imitation of suicidal behaviour after its appearance in the news. The term originates in Goethe\u2019s novel Leiden des jungen Werther (The Sorrows of Young Werther, 1774). The number of youths who ended their lives in a similar way to that described in the book increased notably after its publication, so much so that it caused the book to be banned in several European countries. This is why all the cases which can be considered as imitation after this type of events have been reported in the media are known as \u201cThe Werther Effect\u201d (\u00c1lvarez, 2012). When a celebrity is involved it is also known as the \u201ccopycat\u201d effect (Herrera et al., 2015) and there is an increase in suicide cases when this type of suicide is in the news, which goes to show the strong impact that these cases of celebrities committing suicide can have, as with Antonio Flores (1995) in Spain or with Kurt Cobain (1994) throughout the world (Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez & Olmo, 2014).  2.3.2. The \u201cPapageno\u201d Effect. Following this line we find a parallel theory under the name of the \u201cPapageno\u201d Effect in honour of the character in Mozart\u2019s \u201cThe Magic Flute\u201d (1791), who was dissuaded from committing suicide by the intervention of three children who showed him the alternatives that life has to offer. The \u201cPapageno\u201d effect proposes that news coverage of suicide does not necessarily lead to an increase in suicides.  267 The impact of information about suicide cannot be limited to harmful effects; that coverage of a positive coping mechanism in adverse circumstances, as explained in the press articles on suicidal thinking, may have protective effects (Niederkrotenthaler cited by Herrera et al., 2014: 125). In the media we find two equally dangerous attitudes for the effects that high-profile suicides can produce, be they lack of information or indeed, excessive information. Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez & Olmo, cited by Lois-Barcia, Rodr\u00edguez-Arias & T\u00fa\u00f1ez (2018: 88), uphold \u201cthe need to inform responsibly, without sensationalism, without euphemisms and by treating it as a subject of public health\u201d. Many authors have suggested the influence that mass media has on the imitative effect of attitudes and behaviour. In this sense, positive and responsible treatment would be to follow the guidelines as laid out by the WHO in the SUPRE project of 1999, and the document published in 2000 with the title \u201cSuicide prevention: an Instrument for Media Communication Professionals\u201d, whose aim is to train professionals of Communication in the task of progressively reducing suicide mortality (Clinical Practice Guidelines in the National Health System (SNS), 2012). Likewise, the prevention campaigns are a little used tool, for the same reasons of imitation and contagiousness. However, various studies conclude that the awareness campaigns on suicide improve people\u2019s attitudes and reduce stigma towards mental illness (Clinical Practice Guidelines in the SNS, 2012; P\u00e9rez Barrero, 2005). So the main aim of talking about suicide publicly through institutional campaigns is to remove stigma, which directly contributes to its prevention. Campaigns are needed which promote mental health, just as the initiatives which abound focusing on avoiding accidents, violence or illness. \u201cTalking about suicide is a way of combatting it\u201d (P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez, 2014).  2.3.3. Campaigns on the Prevention of Suicide in Spain As we have pointed out throughout, the number of prevention campaigns on this phenomenon is very low; because of the theories already explained and the stigma of suicide it is not easy to find campaigns. The Spanish Foundation for Mental Health includes the existing programmes for the prevention of suicidal behaviour in both Europe and Spain. The most relevant European programmes are \u201cEurogenas\u201d and \u201cSupreme\u201d, initiatives which aim to prevent suicidal thoughts and behaviour by focusing particularly on reducing or eradicating stigma surrounding mental disorders. On the other hand, in Spain, where there is no strategic state plan, we find at least fourteen prevention programmes developed independently at a regional and local level. Among these the protocols carried out by Galicia, Castilla-La Mancha, Murcia, l\u2019Eixample in Barcelona and the Valencian Community. All of them are centred on preventing suicidal behaviour, and recognise the importance of promoting social awareness campaigns for their positive effect on being able to change attitudes towards this topic in society and in the minds of individuals (Plan for the Prevention of Suicide, Govt. Galicia, 2017). It is worth pointing out that many of the actions are aimed exclusively at health workers in order to eradicate stigma in this group and provide guidelines for a situation which is actually more common than is generally known. However, only in some very specific cases has publicity been generated for the general public as part of a promotional strategy. These cases can be found in the Madrid Community, through their Mental Health Plans (2010-2014, 2018-2020) and in the Valencian Community with the Plan for Prevention of Suicide and Suicidal Behaviour Management (2026-2020). In both regions, the Public Administrations have produced programmes and strategies which coincide in their validity as campaigns for prevention, but they differ in the way they have been carried out. The Valencian Community stands out as a pioneer among the initiatives for prevention by placing communication at the centre as one of the tools. Whilst it is true that the protocols of the remaining regions also value communication as part of a strategy of prevention, none of them have created an integral strategy of communication which ranges from a website to television spots. In any case, it should be highlighted that in all of the plans, communication is considered as a key tool for ending the stigma associated with mental illness of any type, and specifically with suicide. The question of the theories of \u201ccontagiousness\u201d, as we have explained with the Werther Effect, contrasted with the Papageno Effect, give rise to solutions based on communication.    268 2.3.4. International Suicide Prevention Campaigns Both in Europe and throughout the world, campaigns are more common, but the treatment of suicide in those contexts has to be understood before we can talk about them in depth. To look at the situation beyond the borders detracts somewhat from the main focus of this study, however it is interesting to mention some of the projects which, by using an open treatment strategy have produced good results designed to give a solution to one of the main problems of global public health (WHO, 2018). As for the social campaigns for the prevention of suicide, the most significant in Europe are in Austria, the United Kingdom and Romania; in Asia, Singapore and South Korea, and lastly, Australia. All of these regions have high rates of suicide, albeit not the highest. According to WHO, the ratio of suicides per 100,000 inhabitants in these countries is at about 9 in the European regions and between 15 and 20 in the Asian regions. In Spain the ratio is 8.7. The initiatives which have produced the best results for reducing the suicide rate are based on communication strategies which centre their efforts in a triad: publicity campaigns for prevention which treat the problem of suicide openly, the removal of dramatic and sensationalist treatment of suicide cases in the media, and the production of information guides on prevention and detection of suicidal behaviour aimed at different sectors and with different objectives, which deal with the same issue in a different way depending on the target audience (males, females, youths) and on the context in which they are placed (Clinical Practice Guidelines in the SNS, 2012). Campaigns such as \u201cRead between lines\u201d (Scotland), \u201cSmall Talk Saves Lives\u201d, (UK), \u201cFind the reason before it\u2019s too late\u201d (Romania), \u201cR U OK?\u201d (Australia), \u201cIt\u2019s time to take suicide seriously. Seriously\u201d (Singapore), or \u201cBridge of life\u201d (South Korea) are example of the initiatives carried out in these countries which have shown a significant effectiveness in the reduction of suicides in their respective regions. These initiatives reflect the value given to suicide in different countries and contexts, and why in each country they address the public in a different way. The tone used in Singapore is not the same as in Australia or the UK, which shows just how important it is to know your audience in order to approach it in the best way. Also, the way in which the matter is going to be addressed in terms of its seriousness, as is the case in Asia, conditions the resources used - type of graphics, styles and creativity. Language as a resource is repeated in many cases, but with changing tones and styles. We detect a clear change between Western Europe (the UK, Scotland and Austria), Eastern Europe (Romania) and Asia (Singapore). In the latter the issue is treated from a harder, even aggressive, standpoint; likewise in Romania, whilst the tone adopted in the West (and we include Australia also) is more friendly. In any case, even if the way the public is addressed differs on certain points, the objective of each of them remains the same: to speak openly about suicide and to do so with people who feel affected by it.  3. Methodology Now we shall analyse the advertising strategy used by the Valencian Community and the regional Health Council with the launching of its campaign in 2018 \u201cLet\u2019s break the silence. Let\u2019s talk about suicide\u201d. Our choice of this particular campaign for our analysis is based on its originality as an institutional communication, for up to that time there had been no campaigns with similar features either in the Valencian community or anywhere else in Spain. If we take the Werther theory into account, talking about suicide in the mass media could create a copycat effect. Meanwhile, on the other hand, the Papageno effect proposes that talking about suicide in a responsible way can be positive for preventing it. Through critical analysis of the discourse we shall weigh up whether the campaign in question achieves the effect it has aimed to produce or whether it could end up being counter-productive. The ultimate aim of this analysis is to study the way in which publicity communication has taken on a problem of public interest without precedent, by applying a qualitative research via critical discourse analysis. The methodology we use is divided into two phases. In the first we apply the model of advertising discourse analysis devised by professors Ba\u00f1os & Rodr\u00edguez from the Communication Sciences Department of the King Juan Carlos University. The content analysis it comes from is a widely used technique in the field of social sciences and specially used as a research tool in the field of communication sciences, which will allow us to understand the campaign at the advertising, narrative and social levels.  269 The model of analysis of advertising discourse applied to social publicity tries to discover to what extent the discursive nature of the message designed by a third sector influences the viewer\u2019s attitude (knowledge, affect and action) towards these causes (Ba\u00f1os & Rodr\u00edguez, 2009). Added to this method of analysis, in the second phase we interview two of the people responsible for making the campaign, who contribute a more complete view of the working process and the public health basis which it has been guided by.  3.1 Analysis of the advertising discourse of the campaign \u201cLet\u2019s break the silence. Let\u2019s talk about suicide\u201d. 3.1.1. Technical Data Agency: Kanbei Creative Company Advertiser: Valencia Generalitat.

Suicide Prevention Campaign. https://bit.ly/2HNFMFV  3.1.2. Analysis of the source; needs and strategies. The Valencia Generalitat is responsible for broadcasting the texts with no other collaborating body of intervention, so it can be described as an institutional campaign of a social nature. The same applies to the advertising, for it is not only responsible for the message itself, but also for shaping and broadcasting it. The nature of the discourse gives rise to a single voice which adopts different discursive strategies in order to achieve a range of objectives within one message. First of all it adopts the role of informer by revealing hitherto unknown information which is of interest to the people. By using description of events and affirmations, the wording aims to persuade the public via a change of perspective, which serves to change perceptions and, consequently, attitudes towards suicide. In order to connect with the audience a series of publicly accepted cultural and social references are used, independently of the context in which they are found. The principal elements they have chosen to use can be more readily identified by the public and the message driven home more effectively. The advertising discourse relates directly to cultural traditions with which the public immediately identify. \n 270 The aim of the campaign is to take the real dimension of the problem into society and bring about an awareness of the situation (GVA, 2018). In order to achieve this, the axis of communication is the fact that in the Valencian Community the high number of suicides and attempted suicides is not generally broadcast because of the taboos which surround it. And everyday items are used creatively in order to start the conversation that can help to change things. All this is embodied in the slogan \u201cLet\u2019s break the silence. Let\u2019s talk about Suicide\u201d and the campaign is aimed at the general public resident in the Valencian Community, and at people who are at risk and their families and close contacts. The video spots specifically target the two most vulnerable groups: the young and the over 65s.  3.1.3. Analysis of the advertising message Three different images have been chosen as a way of targeting specific groups according to people\u2019s consumer habits. The three main elements are a bench, a take-away coffee and a bag of sunflower seeds, all of which are products which invite conversation in parks, caf\u00e9s and just about anywhere in the city. Figure 3. Images in the campaign \u201cLet\u2019s break the silence. Let\u2019s talk about Suicide\u201d \n Source: Video Case Agency Kanbei for the Festival La Lluna 2018.  Using the model for analysis designed by Dr. Javier Marzal Felici (2004) we shall discuss the image at a contextual, compositional and morphological level for the posters and the video spots, both of which use the same image. It corresponds to a still-life, as it contains only digitally created objects and no interaction with other elements. The objects are positioned in an unidentifiable and uniform space, thereby creating a flat representation based on visual simplicity. This simplicity is not to be considered as an obstacle but as the use of a series of non-complex elements with a certain degree of abstraction, as they are not in a real or recognisable place. The symmetry and regularity of the image accentuate the composition\u2019s simplicity, strongly marked by the verticality and rhythm, which lends the image a static balance. Both structural parameters are particularly reflected in the colour, for three colours alternate (orange, purple and black) in a regular and constant way to create a visual pattern loaded with stability and harmony. On the other hand, the objects are positioned in the centre of the composition, creating a general line of vertical movement. In spite of being completely static, the distribution of weight creates a reading direction guided by the weight and hierarchy. As it is a flat representation without depth on a solid colour background, the visual order is marked by the hierarchy of size. In this sense the main element stands out (coffee cup, bench or bag of sunflower seeds) by its greater size or weight. When the centre of interest coincides with the geometric centre of the image this produces a focus of attention. All the elements have an influence because they induce meaning to the image independently of their size, so the slogan and the Generalitat logo are the second components in the reading order, followed by the different claims. The only element which could break the symmetry and the order of the overall image is the text in the top left corner, which draws the reader\u2019s attention and requires a necessary minimal movement.  \n 271 3.1.4. Content variables: indicative aspects of the formal elements, values transmitted and significance of the message Tone and style: The manner of appeal to the public denotes proximity, for its use of informal and familiar language without resorting to colloquialism. At the same time, it adopts a formal and informative style by presenting each of the main elements in different formats as part of an academic definition. It also draws upon statistical data which enhances the rationality of the message. Above all, it transmits a disturbing message with seriousness yet with a degree of sympathy through the choice of colours, music or tone in the voice-overs. Interpretation of the social discourse: The discourse promotes the conversation on the reality ignored by most of society and, on many occasions, transmitted wrongly by the mass media. By connecting with the values and current cultural mores of the target audience it approximates a shared story in which the conversation stimulated by a coffee, a typical snack or a bench is common. With this public story another one is spoken of which could become greater with the whole of society implicated. The values the campaign is working towards achieving are responsibility and empathy. Responsibility on the part of those who can prevent suicide in a positive way (mass media, society, health workers, etc.), and empathy on the part of the environment of someone who is going through a bad time and needs help. In short, it seeks a compromise between two realities, that which communicates with enthusiasm and that which reflects a serious health problem. The results of the campaign cannot as yet be measured, but its repercussions can. Months after its launch, the health authority has noted a threefold increase in detection of cases according to sources close to the promoting advertising agency. And the central government has responded to the initiative by starting up a project to launch a national campaign.  3.2. Interviews with members of the Office for Mental Health In order to know the origins and preparation of the campaign at first hand we interviewed two members of the Mental Health Office of the Health Council who were directly implicated in the project. Bego\u00f1a Frades, regional coordinator for the Office for Mental Health and Jos\u00e9 A. L\u00f3pez, technician for the Council of Universal Health. First of all we asked them about the real situation of suicide in the Valencia Community, to which the reply was that the data they handle \u201cis not even real\u201d. Currently about 800,000 people around the world take their own lives, according to data from the WHO, and it is a very serious public health problem. They specify that the statistics for the Valencian territory reach almost 390 people per year, which is more than one person per day, and that there are 4,500 attempted suicides per year. They are sure there are actually even more, because at times, for many social reasons, (shame, insurance policies, myths, etc.) the families try to cover it up. \u201cThe figures are high. Since 2008 the number of suicide victims is twice as high as road accident deaths, and 40 times more than victims of domestic violence, according to the data from the Health Council.\u201d From a clinical perspective they state that it is a phenomenon of many causes, with an infinite number of motives which provoke it, be it the loss of a family member, depression, social problems, etc. \u201cThere are very many reasons, and a mental disorder is not necessarily one of them. The most vulnerable groups here are males over 65 and young people between the ages of 15 and 29\u201d they tell us. As such, it is worth consulting the experts as to how this taboo which does not allow open discussion has been built. \u201cWestern cultures have generated a stigma about the act of taking one\u2019s life voluntarily and there are whole series of myths which feed back into the problem, compounding the stigma. As a taboo it is not easy to end, mostly because the media by and large do not know how to deal with it\u201d. So, just how do the media deal with it? The answer we are offered is that in general there is a negative treatment from the media, particularly from the newspapers. Everything revolves around sensationalism and too much is detailed \u2013 on the method used, whether a note was left, whether the person had been fired from work \u2013 sensationalist information. In many cases it is true that when the media talk in these terms it produces a copycat effect. This is exactly what happened in the case of the DJ Avicii, about which the details were discussed uncontrollably. The case of celebrity or famous people suicides is more delicate, although it has to be said that \u201cthe media are behaving more responsibly\u201d. When we ask how the Health Council are dealing with one of the main problems of public health according to the WHO, they confess that until 2016 there were no regulations covering the matter, and until one was  272 introduced there was no type of plan. In 2017 the Plan for the Prevention of Suicide and Handling of Suicidal Behaviour was approved, and the project started to be taken seriously. The Community got involved and was a fundamental part to begin working. In spite of the delay in the plan they claim that there are projects in other communities but that none of them are as specific or as big as the Valencian Community one. As stated in the public document of the plan, the first line of strategy of the project is the \u201cPromotion of Mental Health\u201d. Among the actions are the awareness campaigns for the people. With these initiatives we are struck by the doubt as to whether they could produce a negative affect or rejection by the people due to stigma suffered and how little it is mentioned in the mass media, to which both interviewees responded that this is one of the myths we have to face, as the Werther effect only applies when there is an irresponsible treatment by the media. In this case, they have worked very carefully together with the Kanbei advertising agency and they recount it as having been a very complicated process. A process of \u201cgreat responsibility\u201d they conclude. We ask them, with regard to one of the most specific aims of the 2016-2000 plan, which is to reduce suicides by 10% as a key part of the prevention, whether campaigns are a fundamental part of achieving their aims. The Office for Mental Health does realize that a campaign is not going to end suicides, because there will never be zero suicides, that is very complicated to achieve. The main thing to achieve this aim is to bring about awareness in the people first of all, provide information about the phenomenon, train health workers, and lastly, incentivise the demand for help, all through the prevention campaigns, just as is being done. The key is to break with the myths and talk. We need to talk (in a responsible way) to achieve its prevention, never its elimination. As for the choice of the concept \u201cLet\u2019s break the silence. Let\u2019s talk about suicide\u201d, this contrasts with other campaigns which have used euphemisms such as \u201cend it all\u201d, or \u201cdon\u2019t go on\u201d. Experts\u2019 opinion is that the use of more subtle or more indirect language is just as effective in any case. The important thing is to be talking about suicide one way or another. Although a logical dynamic does have to be followed when the topic is posed in the media for the first time, and in this case they have opted to talk like this, any other way is also valid. Always, they insist, with responsibility to the fore.  4. Analysis of the results In line with the successful campaigns carried out in other countries like the UK or Scotland, the campaign proposed by the Valencia Generalitat in Spain opted to follow the strategy used in these countries and treat the problem of suicide openly, using a tone which is both familiar and which invites conversation. The main objective of the campaign is to make the problem of suicide visible, and it does this from two lines of action. It stimulates conversation among the general public in order to eliminate a taboo which, in itself, stops people who do not feel in a good state of mental health from seeking help. So it proposes that people speak openly about suicide and thereby help those who are on the point of succumbing. In this way, \u201cbreak the silence\u201d is a start towards eradicating the taboos and myths of the psychological problems suffered by so many, but who having been subject to such marked stigma have not the strength to talk about it in public. The strategy designed for the campaign fulfils the basic criteria in the choice of content and the code of the message. The axis of the campaign is powerful but yet to be exploited by the Generalitat, responding to a collective truth backed by world organisations such as the WHO and to statistical data. The concept\u2019s mission is to provoke conversation in its audience. It creatively represents the way to confront a world health problem but does not have media repercussions. Expressed through simple, clear and direct images it is capable of transmitting the message without resorting to the typical topics to be found in other campaigns, such as sad or depressed people. In this sense, the choice of everyday elements as characters makes sure that no segment of the population feels excluded, given that all types of public can feel identified depending on the use they give to each of the products. The ordinariness of the elements for starting conversations avoids an initial rejection when talking about a \u201cdisagreeable\u201d subject, and thanks to the method\u2019s simplicity it is made more accessible. This first campaign was conceived to be a first contact between the problem of suicide and society, so it is about creating awareness combined with a balanced strategy of emotion and reason. In order to persuade it does not take advantage of emotions, but it does not restrict itself purely to information either. It makes good use of both ingredients to connect with the public on a matter which affects us all, but which can be changed through words and collaboration.   273 5. Discussion and conclusions Having carried out the research on each of the aspects that affect suicide either directly or indirectly, one is aware of the severity and extent of a problem caused by many factors about which there has been a consensus to tackle it positively for the past two decades with the SUPRE programme (1999), based on the Papageno effect and backed by the World Health Organisation. Nevertheless, in many countries like Spain, this information has not resulted in effective and real actions which bring to light the positive effects that general campaigns lead to in prevention and reduction of the problem. It is the government secretaries or ministers, foundations or specialised organisations who should be bringing awareness about this social problem to the people. The way to do it with the greatest repercussions is through the public institutions, introducing suicide as one of the priorities of public health, just as road accidents are. In fact, we know about these as a success in the prevention policies thanks to a long history of campaigns and a logical communication strategy sustained over time. Legislation should be adapted to society\u2019s needs, and at this point it is necessary to define a plan of national communication provided with the sufficient funding. Mass media should be the key to normalizing the phenomenon with an innovative and integral focus aimed mainly at the people, regardless of whether they are directly affected by the problem. The first intention of the prevention campaign is not to stop someone from committing suicide but to listen, for by listening there is less likelihood of suicide being committed. As a result, the best line of action would consist of bringing visibility, awareness and education to society, to the affected and the survivors. An adequate strategy for a gradual transformation in the system, which allows associations to work as a network together and in coordination with the regional governments. So as a collective aim, the creation of spaces for communication open to participation would be essential, where the main bodies implicated could dialogue without prejudice. The angle of communicative actions should seek to achieve three objectives: firstly, visibility of the problem (make the seriousness of suicide clear); secondly, bringing awareness to the people (consciousness-raising of the problem and that it is possible to prevent it); and finally, training society (educating on how to address the problem). In short, work together with the media, associations, foundations and governments with the main aim of making the affected group visible, making adequate use of the terminology, concepts and words which, ultimately, will normalise a silenced suffering. On the other hand, it is not necessary to enter into excessive emotion, but to adequately combine reason with emotion and thereby achieve a rupture of the stigma through a reasoned basis. As for the critics who support the Werther copycat effect, the Papageno theory justifies the opposite. In a society in which we are more and more connected and we have more facilities for staying in touch it is frustrating to see that the feeling of loneliness is generalised and produces psychological and mental problems which can spiral into suicidal intentions. For this reason, and based on the Papageno effect, we have the opportunity to incentivise conversation about suicide in a responsible and positive way in order to normalise and reduce it, thanks to communication and conversation.  6.

This television series was selected both for its content and its temporal and topical criteria. The empirical section of this paper was performed by way of content analysis and carried out through identification of the main non-verbal behavioural patterns of the selected characters and their subsequent relationships with the different female stereotypes represented in the sitcom. As a consequence, the conclusion highlights that, despite being a series depicting an atypical American family showing different ways of everyday life management, it still portrays a highly stereotyped and clich\u00e9d image, especially with regard to female characters.  Este trabajo de investigaci\u00f3n se articula en el estudio de la estereotipaci\u00f3n que proyectan los personajes protagonistas femeninos en la sitcom norteamericana Modern Family a trav\u00e9s de su comunicaci\u00f3n no verbal. La elecci\u00f3n de esta serie de televisi\u00f3n responde tanto a criterios de contenido como temporales y de actualidad. La parte pr\u00e1ctica de este art\u00edculo se ha desarrollado mediante la t\u00e9cnica del an\u00e1lisis de contenido y se ha llevado a cabo a trav\u00e9s de la identificaci\u00f3n de los principales patrones no verbales de los personajes seleccionados y su posterior puesta en relaci\u00f3n con los distintos estereotipos femeninos presentes en la comedia de situaci\u00f3n. De esta forma, se ha podido establecer como principal conclusi\u00f3n que, a pesar de tratarse de una serie que muestra una familia americana at\u00edpica en la que tienen cabida maneras muy diferentes de afrontar la vida cotidiana, sigue transmitiendo una imagen altamente estereotipada y plagada de t\u00f3picos especialmente en lo que respecta a sus personajes femeninos.

Introduction The figure of women in the audiovisual world is greatly diminished nowadays. Their presence may become even non-existent, whatever scope it is analyzed. With regard to creative, authorial, artistic or interpretive issues, it is the male figure who stands out and prevails. Menendez reflects on this situation, stating that:  Women, both in film and television products, are a minority who also lacks narrative relevance: there are hardly any protagonists and, when there are, they almost always appear stereotypically, occupying a secondary and even expendable place and often with an inappropriate or disrespectful treatment. (2018) However, women\u2019s situation is undergoing a very promising change, where we must continue to work. This is a statement of intent and a very firm step towards equality. One of those global changes is the emergence of the #MeToo feminist movement, which has been a necessary speaker of what will eventually end up being defined as a new social awareness of respect for women. All these movements are having their impact, since the presence and decision-making capacity of women, in the different aspects of audiovisual creation, are becoming increasingly present. As Diaz (2017) points out, \"the current series represent that variety by focusing on the millennials of 'Girls', the ladies of 'Grace and Frankie' or the difference of characters and personalities from 'Orphan Black\u2019s clones.\" These advances are not alien to the format of the sitcom, since they have been being produced in this format from its origins. This progress has been reflected in the evolution of the figure of women in the roles she represents, starting with the figure of the housewife given to her family, to the independent woman, who seeks her personal and professional development. This image of women began to appear on the sitcom in the 1960s and 1970s, reflecting the search for new social concerns.  2. Theoretical Context: sitcom, stereotypes and non-verbal communication 2.1. Sitcom. Definition and main features. The word sitcom arises from the contraction of the words situation and comedy and denotes a television genre \u2013 considered minor by many authors \u2013 whose main function is to entertain. Its background is in the radio and film serials of the first decade of the twenties (Padilla and Requejo, 2010: 188). These are comedies that produce laughter and allow the viewer, overwhelmed by daily chores in a society projected towards absolute liquidity, to disconnect. Since they began to be seen at the small screen, sitcoms are characterized by a theatrical staging, a three-act narrative structure that includes, as a hallmark, the reactions of the audience found on set during each chapter\u2019s recording. Besides, they are distinguished from the rest of the series by the prominence of visual gags and the freshness of their dialogues (Herrero, 2016: 6-7). As established by Toledano and Verde (2007), L\u00f3pez (2008) and R\u00edos San Mart\u00edn (2012), the best way to understand the construction process of the sitcom, would be to set three development points around it: form, style and narrative. Regarding form, it is important to note that the duration of each episode is usually from 24 to 30 minutes, with self-concluding narratives; so they often lack continuity between episodes. It is also important to note that it depends, to a large extent, on a repeating formula, a \"standard\" situation with changing events. However, within the formula, innovation is necessary to attract the audience and meet their expectations. In fact, they usually include irregular camera movements that capture those everyday scenes at a very fast pace (Henneberg, 2016). Style is the second aspect that allows to build the sitcom, which is characterized by being recorded inside a studio with home setting decorations (usually indoors), where domestic or for situations are usually located. Besides, the number of locations used is limited and the staging is of a common character. Finally, the narrative has as sitcom\u2019s main feature, that it rarely extends from one chapter to another, even in those that have narrative lines in progress, starting with an event or situation which is solved at the end of it. In addition, they are normally based on everyday situations which may occur in the work environment or in the family. In general, it can be said that, sitcom\u2019s narrative has a circular structure, starting from a break-even point, there is an event that generates an imbalance in that starting point, in order to finally return to the balance at the end of the episode. In the case of the analyzed sitcom, Modern Family (Levitan and Lloyd,2009), the textual analysis determines the use of the television frames to build and project different family types settled, that is, in strong traditional values (Fogel, 2013).  279 Following the established by Bonaut and Grand\u00edo (2009: 62) there are a number of differences that define this new sitcom: \u2022 Narrative with a humorous purpose, can reach such a level, that the narrative becomes a mix of anecdotes. \u2022 The mix of genres, such as comedy and soap opera, is all carried out in a documentary style, called Mockumentary. \u2022 Humor undergoes an evolution. Elements already used in sitcoms such as Senfield (Shapiro, Wets, Seinfeld and Mamann-Greenberg, 1990) are increasing, becoming more and more absurd and crazy. That is, the construction of the characters is carried out reflecting an eccentric and bizarre personality. A clear example of this character evolution, can be found in Larry David, Senfield\u2019s producer and protagonist of the sitcom Curb your Enthusiasm (David, Garlin and Polone, 2000). \u2022 The abandonment of the domestic ground to surf in politically incorrect situations and problems. Any type of situation can be used for comic purposes, from personal and family tragedies to reaching the professional world.  2.2. The depiction of stereotypes in the sitcom. A stereotype consists of the exaggerated and simplified perception you have about a person or group of people who share certain characteristics. The objective pursued by the stereotype is to justify or rationalize certain behavior in relation to a social category, as pointed out by Malgesini and Gim\u00e9nez: Stereotype derives from the term estereotipa, used in typographic technology. Etymologically, it comes from the Greek words ster\u00e9os, solid, and typos, mold. Its employment was introduced, more than seventy years ago, by the American journalist Walter Lippmann (1922), in his book Public Opinion (2000: 147). According to Lippmann's definition (1922) the term stereotype has four main characteristics: being a simple concept rather than complex or differentiated; being more false than true; having been acquired second-hand rather than from direct experience and being resistant to change. Nowadays, retrieving Lippman's definition and as a synthesis, we can say that the stereotype is the mental recreation of an image in relation to a group of people who share certain qualities and/or characteristics. In this way, extrapolating the concept to character building, the stereotype would be a clich\u00e9 or what is called \"type character\u201d. It is necessary at this point to make a special mention of the stereotypes of women in television fiction established by Capdevilla (2010: 76) who, basing them on the taxonomy established by Mar\u00eda Isabel Men\u00e9ndez (2006), generates a list based on the topics\u2019 repetition, which are taken to the extreme in the sitcoms, since they are series based on comedy. In this way, we could find the following categories: \u2022 The 'queen of the home', who starts from religious models, usually close to Christianity, who segregate women to roles centered on housewife, model wife and selfless mother. The rest of the feminine stereotypes start or are born from here, adding skills, whether positive or negative, to generate new models. As Capdevilla points out, \"her natural evolution is towards the matriarch, a typically widowed woman who despite her age continues to serve as queen of the home.\" A basic example of this stereotype would be that of the character played by Lucille Ball in I Love Lucy (Ball, Arnaz and Oppenheimer, 1951). However, it is interesting to review Lacalle's in-depth study that determines the wide range of behaviours adopted by maternal style in television fiction (Lacalle, 2016). Fasciano (2013: 42-43), speaking of this stereotype in the sitcom notes that \"In the early days of television production, (...) the \"traditional woman\" was described as foolish, irresponsible, impulsive and unable to take care of herself without the intervention and supervision of a man.\u201d \u2022 The 'professional woman', for whom her career is above anything else. This stereotype has been very important throughout the sitcom's history, starting from characters such as Lucille Ricardo, in I Love Lucy, which already had certain elements belonging to this stereotype, until reaching great references such as Mary Taylor Moore, Maude (Parker, 1972), Murphy Brown (Jeffords, Heline and Heisler, 1988) in her homonymous series, or more recently Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) in Veep (Luois-Dreyfus), 2012). As Capdevilla says:  280 These characters put their professional career before everything else, which negatively impacts their attitude in the personal realm. In essence, they will have to choose between having a life beyond work, or developing a brilliant career. They will choose the second (2010: 77). Likewise, this stereotype of 'professional woman' has undergone a supposed evolution. Reflecting American society, the sitcom has brought these changes to its format. However, such changes are superficial, the figure of man remains essential, as Haijing points out: American-style motherhood, according to the stereotype of 'good wife', values women who succeed in combining motherhood and their careers. Ideal motherhood is situated in a society that values independence but still reinforces the patriarchal structure of society by portraying it as historical and consequently, normal. This intensive motherhood imposes high standards on women who must strive to meet it, but despite all their efforts, the solution to their problem will inevitably be a man in their lives: a savior (2016:107-108). \u2022 The stereotype of 'bad woman' which is very useful in the sitcom, since it allows to generate tension and comedy. He usually takes as an example the stereotype of the queen of the household and turns it around, being a character who does not care about domestic work nor family life. Here we find characters such as Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White) in the sitcom The Mary Taylor Moore Show (Brooks and Burns, 1970). \u2022 The 'victim' woman who is characterized by having suffered some kind of abuse, so trauma absolutely conditions her attitude and makes it difficult to achieve her goals. This stereotype in the sitcom is muffled, but it still exists, as is the case with Amy Farrah Folwer's character, played by Mayim Bialik, in The Big Bang Theory (Lorre and Prady, 2007).  \u2022 \u201cThe 'male woman'. This type of character\u2019s features are typical of men, both in terms of physique and the ways of acting. In this section we would find characters such as C. C. Babcock (Lauren Lane) in The Nanny (Drescher and Landsberg, 1993). The 'feminist' woman who, as Capdevilla comments, is an: Uncommon stereotype, which reduces the struggle for equality to a careless physical aspect and an irresponsible personality to the classic roles of the queen of the household; it is also especially intense overturned in her professional life when there is a case of sexism around (2010: 77). \u2022 `The 'lesbian woman' where there are two archetypal models to play with because of their ambivalences at the narrative level. On the one hand, there would be the Butch model of androgynous and male features, where her gestures and mimicry are forced, forcing the stereotype to the male end. On the other hand, there would be the Femme model with very feminine traits with a tendency to hide her sexual orientation. Despite the wide variety of feminine stereotypes used in sitcoms, the truth is that women\u2019s image linked to household chores continues to be perpetuated either exclusively or by combining them with work activities outside the home. In fact, around post-feminism, Scott (as quoted in Novoa) tells us about the trap that sitcoms have set around it: Over the past fifty years, women and the way they have been seen in American society have changed. It is hoped, of course, that they will climb, occupy and manage positions previously reserved exclusively for men. (...) Currently, we find that women in TV comedies are typically represented in two basic life patterns: having jobs outside the house, while doing most household chores, or not having out-of-home jobs (2018: 71).  2.3. Non-verbal communication as a tool/support in creating attitudes and stereotypes Within the context that has been exposed, it is vitally important to highlight the role that nonverbal communication plays in creating stereotypes through the construction of characters that peep into the stage of television fiction. Nonverbal communication can be defined as the exchange of non-linguistic signs (Fast, 1979: 5). More specifically, it could be said that it consists of the communication process where there is a sending and a receiving of information that does not require words (Wainwright, 1993: 194). This type of language serves five main functions in interlocution: it emphasizes verbal language, expresses feelings and emotions, replaces words, helps interpret oral messages and regulates verbal communication (and even contradicts it) (Argyle, 1978). However, for this research purpose of study, the interesting thing lies in the great potential of the nonverbal channel assuming the impact of the characters\u2019 message observed in the case of the sitcom, as well as  281 the transmission of conduct codes associated with gender stereotypes. At this point it should be remembered that the potential for transmission of information by the nonverbal channel reaches 55% in the case of body language (facial and body gestures, postures and ways) and even increases to 93% if the qualities associated with voice (intensity, tone, timbre, duration, etc.) are added, as opposed to the 7% of information that comes to us through words (Mehabian , 1972). There are several categories of nonverbal communication. Thus, although there is no agreement among experts, a total of five will be established in order to organize the gestural inventory responsible for the creation of certain stereotypes. In this way we can talk about kinesia (gestures, postures and ways), proxemics (distances between subjects), paralanguage (aspects related to voice qualities), physical appearance and appearance (physical complexion, costume, accessories, etc.) and environment (settings, colours, etc.) (Hern\u00e1ndez and Rodr\u00edguez, 2010: 13 and next). In the case at hand, we will focus on kinesia and specifically on gestures that in their combination can create behavioural patterns associated with certain gender stereotypes in the female spectrum. In this regard, kinesia comes from the Greek prefix kin\u00e9 and means movement. As noted, it encompasses gestures, postures and manners. The latter category is discarded in this work since it deals with ways of greeting, eating, giving and receiving and walking movements that do not contribute to drawing gestural stereotypes by themselves. Gestures, on the other hand, are short movements of certain parts of the body that can be seen more clearly in the head and limbs allowing to achieve a degree of expressiveness and subtlety that does not occur in other nonverbal signals (Wainwright, 1993: 194). The most interesting thing lies in their use to express emotions and attitudes such as frankness, qualm, willingness to do something, tranquility, frustration, trust, nervousness, acceptance, expectations, relationship type and mistrust (Nierenberg and Calero, 1973). If attention is now paid to the second category, it should be noted that posture is a mostly unintentional signal which is also involved in the communication process. In fact, the position of trunk and limbs, the way of sitting, standing, etc. reflect attitudes, emotions and feelings about herself and her relationship with the interlocutor. Thus, it is precisely in this aspect that a relationship between gestures and stereotypes can be established.  3. Analysis Methodology and research development  For the carrying out of this research, content analysis has been chosen as a research method primarily to meet the objectives pursued: 1. On the one hand, it is a method that allows the achievement of the first of the objectives proposed in this research, to evaluate the media image and stereotypes associated with the role of women in the Modern Family sitcom, which would fit with one of the five fields identified by Igartua (2006:195) as more convenient to apply content analysis, in particular, with the evaluation of social groups image; 2. On the other hand, this method allows us to achieve the second of the objectives, which materializes in scientifically examining both the meanings (thematic analysis) and the significant (analysis of procedures, conventions, formal traits) of the analysis unit (the message) as set out by Bardin (1986), Weber (1994) Wimmer and Dominick, (1996) (as quoted in Igartua , 2006: 76). This method also allows the quantification of the messages that has granted the numerical data obtained and further treated with statistical techniques in order to obtain verifiable and reliable conclusions or inferences that have helped their interpretation.  3.1. Categorization Categorization is one of the most important parts of content analysis since it allows the researcher to clarify all the aspects that shape the observed reality in addition to finding new nuances and details that could go unnoticed in the previous observation. Thus, the most important part of all content analysis is the category system used to sort the quantified units representing the so-called communication symbols. Each of these categories are characteristic or aspects that represent what the text, even the audiovisual one, refers to. Categorization can be defined as: The task by which a set\u2019s constituent elements are classified by means of differentiation based on certain criteria previously established. Thus, through this operation, we transform the writing into a cluster of parts susceptible to individualized treatment (Conde Berganza and Ruiz San Rom\u00e1n, 2005: 217).  282 In this regard, the categories can be divided into two groups: the formal ones, including duration, broadcast date, etc.; and content categories, such as main topic and self-categories. In the case at hand, the category of non-verbal language. In this way, as established by Rodr\u00edguez and Hernandez: The set of categories used is called code, a concept that involves all categories according to logical criteria. Categories, in order to be properly defined, must include five characteristics: mutual exclusion, homogeneity, relevance, clarity and productivity (2009: 68). However, before proceeding with the design of the analysis sheet, one more concept must be considered, that of the recording unit. It is the body of smallest content where the appearance of a reference is told, be they words, gestures or statements that we are interested in locating and counting (Conde Berganza and Ruiz San Rom\u00e1n, 2005: 221). Finally, the classification unit is the basis on which content is classified or analyzed. Finally, we will keep in mind the enumeration unit that references the base on which a content is tabulated, which will normally be centimeters, minutes, seconds, etc. In this case, two category types have been defined, the formal and content categories. Formal categories pay attention to duration and broadcast date. The broadcast day in this analysis of the Modern Family comedy covers seasons 1 to 9. So, it chronologically corresponds to the period from September 2009 to May 2018. The duration of each chapter is around 22 minutes. With regard to the content categories, as can be seen in the analysis sheet on non-verbal language detailed in section 3.3., there are three groups of main variables on a first level: posture, bodily gestures (which includes hand gestures) and facial gestures (including mouth gestures and gaze). In turn, all the sub-variables that make up the main variables are categorized in a second stage. In the case of posture, 4 sub-variables were used; in the case of hand gestures, 17 sub-variables were used; in facial gestures with the mouth 5 sub-variables were included and finally in the gaze variable,11 sub-variables were used. The content of each of them can be observed in detail in the analysis sheet. Similarly, a color code has been assigned for each variable based on the emotional attitudes they represent. Thus, the variables that appear shaded in blue in the analysis sheet relate to attitudes close to extroversion, oranges would be aggressiveness instead, greens would be close to a spectrum of shyness and withdrawal, and yellow ones would be associated with neutral attitudes. Finally, we will add that the classification basis would be each chapter of the Modern Family sitcom analyzed and the enumeration unit would be the different parts that they are made up: teaser, approach, development, outcome and tag. It is also important to note that an encoding tab was created for each of the observed characters.  3.2. Sampling Chapters from seasons 1 to 9 have been chosen as units of analysis, and within each season,of the initial two, one central and the last two, because it is the most complete way to record the possible changes which may occur in the characters along them. 45 chapters have been displayed in total, so the database should have had 225 rows (45 chapters x 5 characters). However, in 15 chapters there was no presence of the two younger characters, so in the end 30 records (15 chapters x 2 characters) had to be deleted, leaving a database composed of 195 rows.  3.3. Coding The analysis sheet for this work will focus on the Kinetic behavior of characters representing femininity who are: Gloria Delgado, Claie Dunphy, Alex Dunphy, Haly Dunphy and Cameron Tucker. Cameron Tucker is included in the analysis because she assumes the role of the mother of the family, taking care of LiLy, her Vietnamese daughter, and household chores. On the other hand, we should point out that Alex and Haly Dunphy\u2019s presence is quite small in the units analyzed as they correspond to episodes where both are still very young. Below is attached, in table 1, the analysis sheets that have been used in the study of the female protagonists of the series. It includes the three categories used, posture, gestures and facial expressions as well as the 37 variables that have served to define each of them, together with their meaning[1].    283 Table 1: Analysis Sheet RESEARCHED ELEMENT MEANING POSITIVE, NEGATIVE OR NEUTRAL PROJECTION[2] ATTITUDE 1.

It causes sentimentality in the receiver NEUTRAL Emotional balance Source: Compiled by authors  Data coding was carried out by three trained researchers and experts in data analysis. The items have been measured with a three point ordinal scale to measure the intensity of the use of the gestures according to their appearance frequency in each chapter (1= once - not very intense; 2 = twice \u2013 moderate intensity; 3 = three times or more - quite or very intense). Subsequently, for data descriptive analysis, frequency tables have been made for each group of gestures (posture, hand posture and different facial gestures) and in each of the frequency tables the average weighted by the intensity of use has been made for each character and it has been graphically represented. In this way, not only the number of times the character performed the gesture has been collected, but also, the degree of the gesture\u2019s intensity. Later on, and since they were not normal variables, several nonparametric contrasts have been made, in particular, Kruskal Wallis contrast and if necessary that of Mann Whitney's U, to see if there were differences in the use of groups of variables or gestures that denote an outgoing, aggressive and shy attitude, for each of the characters. 40 original variables were used: four identification variables (Id, encoder, protagonist and chapter) and 36 gesture variables were used. To these variables we must add three extra variables: extraversion, aggressiveness and shyness that were created by adding the scores of the related gestures, which were used for inferential analysis. The Excel computer program has been used for data encoding and the Microsoft Excel package and the SPSS version 24 package have been used for data processing.  4. Results 4.1. Descriptive Frequency Analysis The following are the specific conclusions resulting from each character's analysis: Gloria, Claire, Alex, Haley and Cameron based on the parameters collected during the chapter viewing. Graph 1: Posture \n Source: Compiled by authors 010203040506070\nApproach WithdrawalExpansionContractionGloriaClaireHaleyAlexCameron 288 All characters with female roles are built with a high degree of positivity, as can be seen with the high scores that are achieved in both the approach posture and the expansion posture. The characters who exhibit the approach pose the most are Claire and Gloria in front of those characters who do so to a lesser extent that correspond to Alex and Hailey. In the middle ground you may find Cameron. The postural pattern in terms of expansion is identical, with Gloria and Claire being the most expansive ones, Cameron taking third place and Alex and Haley showing it the least often. Besides, retreat and contraction postures (associated with rejection and depression) are less important to all characters, although highlight the high values Claire takes in the latter variable. As a general conclusion we can point out how the data obtained allow us to speak of positive and outgoing attitudes in postural terms. In fact, we observe very similar graphical trends in all cases. The closest and open to communication characters are Claire and Gloria. It draws attention however that Claire is also the character that most often shows a posture of contraction, a variable that relates to depression and subjugation. In this regard, it could be said that Claire, who represents the Middle American housewife, presents herself in postural terms as an emotionally extreme person, moving from joy to depression quite easily. In Gloria's case, her stance of approach and expansiveness relates to the sometimes exaggerated expressiveness of Latin cultures. She presents herself posturally as a close person, prone to physical contact and knowing of the attractiveness she displays among male gender. That is why, in the case of these two characters, the stereotypes of queen of the home and superwoman are confirmed, respectively. In this context, the most similar character to Gloria in postural key is Cameron, who is also a close, outgoing and positive person. The most measured characters in this regard are Claire's teenage daughters Alex and Hailey, who have a more monotonous postural repertoire where their closeness and communicativeness can be highlighted. Graph 2: Positive Body Gestures- Hands \n Source: Compiled by Authors  As for bodily gestures and focusing on hand gestures we can say that the biggest differences between characters occur in positive gestures. In this way, the characters that most variety of positive hand movements exhibit are again Gloria and Claire. However, if we get into detail, when it comes to showing the palms of your hands, it is Haley and Alex who do it more often, followed by Claire. It is striking that this is a non-recurring gesture in Cameron. It is a gesture associated with sincerity, transparency and having nothing to hide. Regarding the illustrating gestures, it is Gloria and Claire who best accompany their discourse of illustrators, gestures that serve to set the pace of speech, point out, show spaces, sizes or conceptualize ideas. They are therefore associated with open, expressive and outgoing people. However, it is Haley the most sparing with such gestures, appearing more inexpressive and even with a more abrupt character. Gestures called \u201cthumbs showing\" (superiority), the \"ring gesture\" (reflection) and the \"hands behind your back\" (authority) do not appear in the course of the chapters analyzed. In establishing a general conclusion we can point out how, in terms of hand gestures associated with positivity, the characters who stand out if we attend to their variety of repertoire, are again Gloria and Claire with Cameron. All three use abundant illustrators to set pace, point out objects, define ideas, explain sizes and shapes, etc. However, it is evident that Gloria does so in a display of exaggerated 0102030405060708090\nGloriaClaireHaleyAlexCameronPalms showingIllustratorsthumbs showingring gestureHands behind your back 289 communicativeness in her communication to even draw attention to herself. Claire uses them to make herself understood in her family environment while Cameron shows them with some typical characteristics of the female gender. Haley and Alex are less expressive even though Alex uses more illustrators than her sister. Both of them stand out when it comes to showing the palms of her hands in a clear sign of candor and sincerity typical of their teenage stage.  Graph 3: Negative Body Gestures \u2013 Hands \n Source: Compiled by authors  As the graph shows, virtually all characters show a varied repertoire of hand gestures that involve negative connotations. At this point, Claire stands out above the others again. She repeatedly appears grabbing all kinds of household objects (food, laundry, cleaning utensils, etc.), an aspect that, together with the high presence of the \"pointing finger\" in scenes scolding her children and husband, consecrates her as the typical housewife adjusted to the stereotype \"queen of the home\". This character also stands out for clasping her hands together on numerous occasions, a sign of repression and self-protection. For her part, Gloria also spends a lot of time with objects in her hands, however, these are usually gifts (luxurious) being the food utensils present to a lesser extent. The Latina actress also exhibits her hands clasped (repression), covers her mouth with her hand (rejection) and her palms are down (authoritarianism). Therefore, it is corroborated in the nonverbal dimension that Gloria has a strong character. She is materialistic and is also confined to household chores, since she loves to cook. Meanwhile, Cameron would seem repressed (if we pay attention to the \"hands clasped\") and slightly aggressive related to the presence of the \"pointing finger\". Alex also uses many objects, mainly books, notes, pens, etc., which provide an image of an extremely perfectionist teenager obsessed with her academic projection. Again it is Haley the flatter character at this point of the research. The results obtained lead us to how the gestures performed that denote negative emotions clearly stereotype several of the female characters analyzed. Claire would perfectly fit with the queen of the home while Gloria would be a mix of this model and that of woman object. Cameron appears as a contradictory character, as she shares a very equal spectrum of negative and positive emotions if her hand movements are taken into account. As for Alex's character, she presents a non-exclusive stereotype of women, in this case they are called Geeks or Nerds, which, according to Guerrero and Gonz\u00e1lez: They have high study levels (graduate, masters, postgraduate), a complex vocabulary that proves their high level of education and are related to technological hobbies (video-games, computers, robots, etc.). However, it has a low level of social relationship that is reflected in the unusual displays of affection (2010:16).       \n 290 Graph 4: Facial gestures- Smiles \n Source: Compiled by authors  The smile types graph yields somewhat unexpected results. As can be seen, the prevailing smile in the five female-role characters is that of fear. A smile that hides positive feelings and relates to fear and surprise at unforeseen events. Gloria is the character who shows it the most, followed by Cameron, Claire, Alex and Haley. Similarly, the false smile that denotes feelings contrary to those shown, hypocrisy and cynicism also stands out. In this case it is Gloria who most exhibits it followed by Cameron, Claire, Alex and Hailey. The rest of the smiles appear to a much lesser extent, drawing attention to the low presence of the authentic smile (associated with candor) in all the characters analyzed. The conclusions drawn to the point that although the characters often smile in the sitcom, they do not do so in a positive and authentic way. Quite the contrary, smiles denote falsehood and fear. The adult female role-playing characters (Gloria, Cameron and Claire) would be the ones who show it the most. They stand out as unsafe, fearful, cold and hypocritical people in much of the plot throughout all the seasons viewed.

The most recurrent gaze in the five is the firm and frank one, related to candor and transparency. The one who shows this the most is Claire, followed by Gloria and Cameron. In this sense, Gloria stresses her aggressiveness by prioritizing her fierce gaze much of the time she is on screen. She looks surprised to a lesser extent, lowers her eyes (humility) and also does so sideways (suspicion). For her part, Claire is much calmer, showing more tranquility with her eye movements. Alex also stands out for the firm and frank gaze, the lowering of eyes (humility) and squinting (contempt). This last look is usually directed at her family when she shows disagreement with them. Cameron clearly stands out for the firm and frank look and Haley is again the flatter character in this regard. All this leads us to a conclusion, through which data regarding the types of looks again confirm Gloria as a temperamental woman with falsehood hints and with high aggressiveness rates. They are traits that could allow us to speak of a stereotype related to the character associated with Latina women aware of the power of their physical attractiveness. Claire would be more balanced at this point by showing herself as a sincere and transparent woman just like Cameron. For her part, Alex would convey shyness and mistrust towards her parents and siblings, a typical trait for teenagers.  4.2. Inferential Analyses In this section we will use the extraversion, aggressiveness and shyness variables, created, as it has been already noted, adding the corresponding gestures to each of them. The Kolmogorov Smirnov test with Lilliefors significance correction (Table 2) verifying that all contrasts are significant, which shows that none of the three variables are normal, so non-parametric contrasts are chosen. In this case, there are 169 observations for each variable because there are protagonists who do not have punctuation in some of the variables in some chapters.

Discussion and Conclusions In global terms, it can be said that although Modern Family is a series that tries to portray an atypical American family where three marriages coexist, of which two are unconventional, it actually conveys a stereotypical image, at least in the characters who portray a female role. Claire's nonverbal behavior reveals a housewife overwhelmed by daily chores who behaves emotionally in an extreme way. She is expressive, compassionate and aggressive at the same time. She stays most of her time doing housework and in a permanent nervous breakdown. She perfectly fits into the \"queen of the home\" model. Meanwhile, Gloria symbolizes the stereotype of \"object woman\" interspersed with \"queen of the home\". Her gestures make her a woman with a strong and exaggerated character, typical of Latin cultures, very concerned with her physical appearance and who shows off the impact she has on male gender. Her nonverbal behavior is associated with tasks like cooking and being flirtatious. Meanwhile, Cameron's character is built on the stereotype of effeminate homosexual, expressive until reaching caricature and who, in nonverbal key, combines extroversion with some patterns of repression. Finally, the two teenagers have a lower prominence in the nonverbal dimension. Thus, while Haley is flat in all the variables analyzed, Alex is set up as a young woman obsessed with her studies, misunderstood by her family and isolated many times in her own inner world. Therefore, we only have to add the concern generated by the perception that the audience of this type of series ends up having on issues related to gender and specifically about the stereotypes projected by the five characters analyzed. The two adult women take a role associated with household chores and family care or a high concern for physical appearance. Meanwhile the pattern of the homosexual character projects attitudes of effeminate and egocentrism. In addition, teenage girls move on the spectrum of puberty without the possibility of maturely interacting in establishing relationships with the rest of the group. Modern Family does not portray a modern, distinct or alternative family if you look at the stereotypes that emerge in their nonverbal behavior. If it were, Claire and Gloria would have a greater balance between their professional and personal lives, Cameron would be a character without effeminate traits and teenage girls would combine the typical puberty attitude with more mature reasoning.  6.

The vast number of statistics collected from scheduled matches have helped data analytics techniques, based on applied mathematics, to be expanded in current sports journalism. This article examines the statistical model in predicting results developed by El Pa\u00eds for the first time to enhance its coverage of a mega sporting event: the 2018 FIFA World Cup held in Russia. This research also analyses the level of acceptance and understanding of this advanced statistical method among heavy users of sports content. To this end, a semi-structured questionnaire involving both open-ended and closed questions was conducted to know the views of both Sports Journalism students and sports reporters from twelve Spanish media outlets. The results reveal that the news values of applying advanced statistics to report on probabilities in a sports tournament encounter a reluctant attitude and an uneven level of understanding among professionals and students. Despite this, data journalism is mainly perceived as a huge opportunity to diversify the agenda and improve the quality of sports coverage.  El periodismo de datos ha hallado en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os un terreno abonado para su expansi\u00f3n en las coberturas deportivas, en particular las futbol\u00edsticas. El sustrato estad\u00edstico de la competici\u00f3n y su car\u00e1cter c\u00edclico han favorecido el desarrollo de esta nueva modalidad de an\u00e1lisis con datos que se apoya en matem\u00e1tica aplicada para expandir el periodismo deportivo actual. Este art\u00edculo profundiza en el estudio de la aplicaci\u00f3n, por primera vez en el diario El Pa\u00eds, de un modelo matem\u00e1tico de predicci\u00f3n de resultados en una gran cobertura como el Mundial de f\u00fatbol de Rusia en 2018.

Los resultados del estudio ponen de manifiesto que el uso de estad\u00edstica avanzada para informar de probabilidades en un torneo a\u00fan encuentra una dif\u00edcil aceptaci\u00f3n period\u00edstica y un desigual grado de entendimiento entre la audiencia. Pese a ello, el periodismo de datos es percibido mayoritariamente como una gran posibilidad para mejorar la diversidad y la calidad de las coberturas deportivas.

Introduction In recent years, data journalism has become one of the main categories of work in digital media when visually representing stories and finding new ways of telling them from an analysis of ordered data sets. Data journalism, a term first coined by Simon Rogers in 2008 in his Datablog in The Guardian (Knight, 2015), has gradually been implemented since then by editorial teams thanks to the accessibility to data new digital platforms have provided. For many authors, data journalism is nothing more than the natural evolution of precision journalism (Dader 1997) while others prefer to define it as a combination of scientific research methods, journalism and the use of a computer as an essential work tool. Crucianelli described it as \"a sum of known methods to which three fruits of technological innovation are added\u201d: the large volume of data which can be accessed nowadays, interactive visualization and the addition of programmer to the journalism team (2013: 107). However, data journalism, despite being a recent phenomenon, is still at an expansive stage in which ever more editorial teams are building equipment to work with databases (Rogers, 2014). Moreover, it has not been evenly implemented by different countries. While some large chains in Europe and America such as The Guardian, Financial Times, The New York Times or the Argentinean La Naci\u00f3n have data and visual journalism departments, in the Spanish media, there is still scant editorial leaning in this direction, due to \u201cthe lack of tradition and training both within and outside editorial teams, as well as the little interest shown in this from those in charge \" of the media (Ferreras, 2013: 130).  To some extent, the media has gradually incorporated techniques from data journalism into their digital production routines for news in order to enrich and diversify the coverage they provide. Meanwhile, Bradshaw (2011) defined this category of journalism as the sum of gathering, refining, contextualizing, combining and communicating data. Veglis and Bratsas (2017a) referred to this type of journalism as a process which consists in extracting useful information from databases, writing articles from this information and adding visualizations to articles (which are often interactive) which help readers understand the stories better. Likewise, the trend in data journalism has entailed publishing different categories of news, which have been classified by different authors. These classifications have been made according to the level of analysis and interpretation required for working on the data so that they can be produced, but, above all, according to the structure and volume of the data included and the methodology used to present information (Veglis and Bratsas, 2017b).  So, for example, Kang (2015) categorized data projects according to their visualization and interaction potential, but, above all, in terms of their journalistic purposes: spots which provide an overview or show how a real situation has evolved over time, charts/world maps which enable the reader to extract local interest data, visual stories in which situations are compared and differences highlighted and stories with more explanatory purposes which are usually built from intersecting different sources of data or research projects. In a process in which statistics are ever more democratic, with a greater number of databases available with open access, journalism needs to work with large volumes of information. This means data journalism\" occasionally becomes curation\u201d (Rogers, 2013: 16), since journalists needs to refine, analyse and use key data from these databases for each story and always seek those which are most pertinent to each piece of news and which can be understood by the reader. In this expansive phase, data journalism has covered all kinds of topics, among which sports is one of those with most potential when telling and displaying stories with statistics (Segel and Heer, 2010; Silver, 2015). Sports information is one of the specialisms in which statistics play an important role and in which it is already very complicated for a match reporter to have data to hand which can clarify what has happened (Marrero-Rivera, 2010: 131). In fact, data journalism is gradually and naturally making headway in sports contents, since competitions create a large amount of data from the results (performance, dynamics, scores...) which are also accumulative in nature in historical series which help to make advanced measurements. So, it was only a question of time, that sports journalism would make use of this mass of statistics to enrich its coverage, as stated by Arias-Robles: It is hard to imagine a speciality which is better adapted to data journalism than sports news, firstly, because any type of competition creates a large amount of quantifiable information; secondly, because a methodological treatment of these data enables specific cases or trends to be shown (2017: 217).  297 When applied to sports news, the purpose of data journalism is to provide added value and new meaning to the statistical registries of teams and sports people, as Rojas and Rivera put it: Rather than just gathering and showing data, data journalism is advanced statistics applied to news in which the key is to analyse the relationships between different variables in order to arrive at some data which are not usually shown by conventional statistics, using a scientific methodology (2016: 3).  Therefore, a clear line can be drawn between basic statistics (the mere exposition or listing of data and statistical registries, as what happens, for example, in live sports broadcasts) and advanced statistics, that is, the processing of statistical data by data journalism in order to go beyond basic statistics and reach new knowledge which can be shown by means of charts and visualizations.  Within this journalistic use of advanced statistics, big data is used to draw up results predictions. Here, probability models in sports coverage are aimed at extracting readings and new interpretations from a set of datificated information that already exists. This set of ordered data is already used by the media, leagues and sports institutions specialized in the storage and processing of sports statistics, such as the American Stats LLC or the British Opta Sports. Sports results prediction models have already been used by the media such as the Financial Times or the website Five Thirty Eight, owned by ABC News, which has made data its trademark (Arias-Robles, 2017: 217). These publications have developed them to diversify their sports coverage, and to provide new angles and perspectives rather than just seeking to broadcast facts. In this regard, Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Cukier hold the belief that accuracy can be sacrificed a little if the trade-off is being able to discover a general statistics behaviour trend. However, they add that \"big data turn arithmetic calculations into something which is more probabilistic than accurate\" (2013: 52). Therefore, models based on advanced statistics, such as those created by El Pa\u00eds for the 2018 Football World Cup, measure probabilities and make future projections from already existing data. So, rather than making mere predictions, they determine which scenarios are more probable within a competition according to a general trend and how to tell the reader about these predictions, following a methodology which characterizes data journalism.   2. Methodology In light of this context, this article includes a case study of the probabilistic model of results from El Pa\u00eds when covering the Football World Cup in Russia held between the 14th of June and 15th of July 2018 which was the first time this Spanish general-interest newspaper used advanced statistical techniques and tools to make predictions with journalistic value within its sports section. The mathematical forecasting model from El Pa\u00eds for the World Cup in Russia, created by the analyst Kiko Llaneras, was initially published on 4th of June, more than a week before the tournament started. After this initial prediction, the Madrid-based newspaper gave predictions one after another for each team as the competition went underway. The situation which acted as a springboard to our study, once the theoretical review was complete, was really brought about by two circumstances. Firstly, the fact that data journalism is even more incipient in sports news in the Spanish media means typical consumers of sports contents still require more time to take in, understand and accept the news value of data projection in probabilistic models of results in the coverage of a large sports event. In this respect, the probabilistic models developed by El Pa\u00eds came up against reluctance and an uneven degree of comprehension among consumers. Secondly, it should be stressed that sports data journalism has great potential which, by using techniques for extracting, analysing and visualizing statistics, can provide new angles for covering competitions as well as enhanced use of graphics and multimedia resources for displaying information visually. This potential not only constitutes an incentive for sports news to move in the direction of providing accurate journalism, and hence, greater quality, but also makes contents more diverse and attractive for the most typical consumers. This is exactly what El Pa\u00eds has been doing with this modus operandi in the coverage of a large sports event. In light of all this, the objectives of this study are as follows: 1. To examine the degree to which data journalism has developed to date in the speciality of sports journalism in Spain.  298 2. To analyse the journalistic value of the results prediction models from advanced statistics on the coverage of a large sports event. 3. To specifically study the probabilistic model from El Pa\u00eds in its coverage of the Football World Cup in Russia in 2018, and compare it with other similar models used by other international media in sports coverage. 4. To find out the impact and degree of comprehension of the techniques used in data journalism among the main groups of typical consumers of this type of news, as well as students of Sports Journalism and the professionals which work in the media and sports sections in Spain. 5. To broaden reflection on its innovative nature, contributions and potential from a data analysis viewpoint for the future of sports journalism. In an attempt to respond to the research objectives, qualitative research was made based on the case study of the probabilistic model developed by El Pa\u00eds in its news coverage of the Football World Cup in Russia. In this regard, not only was this coverage analysed by means of different predictions for each match published in the on-line edition of this newspaper throughout the tournament, but also with the view of the media itself. So, an in-depth interview was made on the 9th of September 2018 with the analyst Kiko Llaneras, author of the mathematical model which is the subject of this study, in order to gain an insight into the methodology he developed and his own assessment of the journalistic experience referred to when the championship had finished.  In the second phase of the research, semi-structured questionnaires were drawn up which were aimed not only at students of Sports Journalism, but also at journalists on the sports editorial teams for Spanish printed and digital media, both general-interest and specialized ones. Therefore, in line with that set out by Rodr\u00edguez-G\u00f3mez, Gil-Flores and Garc\u00eda-Jim\u00e9nez (1999: 73) on how to design qualitative research, the sampling when selecting informants followed intentional, rather than random criteria in order to deal with the attitudes and perceptions of two types of target audience on the phenomenon which is the subject of this study. Moreover, considering the questionnaire as a fundamental instrument for obtaining data and studying attitudes in terms of a problem (Igartua and Humanes, 2009: 94-95), with the results obtained from these sets of questions, the aim was to compare statements, opinions and assessments from two qualified target groups which are typical consumers of sports information. The objectives of the initial questionnaire was firstly, to check the general feeling future journalists had about statistics and how these related to sports journalism, and, secondly, their assessment of the probabilistic model developed by El Pa\u00eds for Russia 2018. In total, 52 valid responses were collected, all of which were from third-year Journalism students at the Faculty of Communication at the University of Seville and enrolled in the Sports Journalism option. The questionnaire was passed to the students online with the tool, Google Forms, on the 4th of April 2019. Subsequently, a similar questionnaire was sent by email to 16 sports journalists from 12 different media. The responses were collected between the 11th and 21st of October 2019 thanks to a follow-up task sent to smartphones (Whatsapp) and social networks (direct messages on Twitter). The journalists participating were: Carles Vila (Mundo Deportivo), Javier S\u00e1nchez (El Mundo), V\u00edctor Garc\u00eda (El Confidencial), Ignacio Labarga and Alberto Ben\u00edtez (Marca), Antonio Medina (Estadio Deportivo), Ignacio Delgado and \u00c1lvaro Ram\u00edrez (El Desmarque), Juan Luis Rodr\u00edguez Cudeiro (El Pa\u00eds), Pablo Salvago (Diario de Sevilla), Mateo Gonz\u00e1lez (ABC), Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez Maldonado (As), Eduardo Casado (20 Minutos) and Enrique Juli\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, Cristina Caparr\u00f3s and Borja Pardo (Sphera Sports). Although both questionnaires were very similar, and most questions were the same, they were designed ad hoc bearing in mind the characteristics of both types of target and based on the questioning from the theoretical review. Given the exploratory and qualitative nature of the research, in both situations closed questions, which are easier to measure from the reduced number of response options, were combined with more open-ended questions so that the participants could explain their personal experiences, as well as their perceptions and assessments of the topic this study is concerned with.  The questionnaire for the students consisted in six questions, all referring to their evaluation of the works published by key media for data journalism, except for the first question, which was more introductory, whose purpose was to measure student interest and acceptance of statistics in general. Meanwhile, the set of questions sent to the journalists covered seven questions. Out of these, four were similar to those posed to the students, while another two were rephrased to find out how professionals valued the news in works based on prediction models, and their thoughts on implementing data journalism in the sports editorial departments in Spain. Lastly, in the seventh question, the journalists were given some results from  299 the questionnaire, which were previously made to the students, for them to interpret what they meant and, in this way, points of view from different types of target audience were dealt with.  3. Results  This qualitative research primarily concerns an explanation and analysis of the mathematical prediction model of El Pa\u00eds as an example of innovative sports data journalism. This model was studied by comparing the updates published by this media on its website throughout the competition with the results which were finally produced, and the explanation the tool author, Kiko Llaneras, himself gave in an interview.   3.1. Explanation of the model The mathematical prediction model developed by El Pa\u00eds for the World Cup in Russia was shown to readers on the 4th of June 2018. That is, ten days before the competition began. The first article was entitled, \"Who will win the World Cup? This is how we made predictions at EL Pa\u00eds\" (1) an initial prediction was provided and a detailed explanation of the methodology used for creating this model was given.   In that initial explanation, El Pa\u00eds showed the model had three fundamental parts: 1) a ranking which measured the strength of each national team; 2) a statistical model which estimated the possible results for each match; and 3) a simulator for the competition. According to Llaneras (2018) in a later article, the points ranking was based on the Elo points system, inspired by its use in chess since the 1950\u00b4s and which has been used to predict football results for some years (Hvattum and Arntzen, 2010). The Elo system consists in calculating the relative skill of a player and his probability of victory from results against opponents (Gickman and Jones 1999). In this way, the results for each national team, goals scored and conceded (\"Elo expected\") and their data  was taken into account. As Llaneras (2018) explained in an article published on completion of the championship, the ranking was based on the data for expected goals for over 200 matches in which national teams have fought since 2017, which was provided by the specialist company in sports statistics, Opta Sports, while to gauge the value of each team, data from 352 clubs and 800 players were used. In the interview made for this research, the data analyst from El Pa\u00eds claims that the model was inspired by academic works and publications from other media with similar methodologies such as Five Thirty Eight or The Financial Times. Among these, there is a reference to a study made in Germany for estimating the results of the matches in the UEFA European Championship in 2016 from a goals distribution formula named Poisson (Arroyo, Bravo, Llin\u00e1s and Mu\u00f1oz, 2014; Groll, Kneib, Mayr and Schauberger, 2016), in which the field factor is taken into account. That is, whether the team is playing at home, away or on a neutral pitch. Likewise, points out that they chose to predict goals rather than victories directly \u201cbecause there are two advantages in doing this: it can better explain the positions in the groups stage and it helps to predict if matches will go into extra time\u201d (2018). Despite the studies which suggest that the models which predict goals underestimate the draws which really occur (Dixon and Coles, 1997: 266-267), Llaneras believes this bias is far less marked in national team tournaments than between clubs. He remarked that when gauging this model, a database was used with 17,000 matches in which national teams participated and for calculating the probabilities throughout different phases of the tournament around 10,000 match simulations were made.  After this initial forecast, El Pa\u00eds published different predictions for every team as the competition went underway (2). However, the competition results did not always match those predictions, which led to criticisms of the model. For example, Germany, one of the favourites was knocked out in the first round of the World Cup, despite having an almost 90% chance of being classified for the knock-out phase of the final; or Spain which had an over 84% chance of passing to the quarter-finals, was defeated in the round of 16 against Russia. These discrepancies between the probabilities published and the actual results during the World Cup in Russia led to a debate on the journalistic value of the data and how ideal it was for publishing information based on predictions and estimations from statistical data accumulated in coverages of large sports events. Moreover, the degree to which the average, and even specialized, reader understood determined analysis and visualizations based on advanced statistics when these are not typical in the media, was questioned, and therefore, when consumers were  not used to interpreting and assessing them appropriately.  300 3.2. Questionnaires In order to check to what extent the El Pa\u00eds model specifically and data journalism in sports news in general is accepted and understood by readers, semi-structured questionnaires were drawn up which were aimed not only at students of Sports Journalism, but also at journalists working in the sports editorial teams of Spanish printed and digital media, both general-interest and specialized ones.   3.2.1. Value and significance of statistical data In the questionnaires, an initial question was posed that was common both to students and journalists in order to measure the degree to which those participating in this study accepted sports statistics in general and to check the significance they gave them as contents, whether these were journalistic or not. The first reading that could be extracted was that sports statistics aroused great interest: 78.8% of university students claimed they liked or were curious about checking data for a sports event while watching it live or after having watched it, and with media professionals, this figure reached 81.25%. Likewise, the participants (61.5% and 68.75%, respectively) recognised that the statistical data was especially attractive for the average spectator, consumer or reader, which may explain why the media are using them increasingly more. However, this consideration does not mean the results are entirely positive in terms of the value and significance both groups give to the statistical data. According to the responses, they are not a tool by which sports events can be explained in themselves or which can optimally define the features of a sports person. Hence, only 25% of students and 12.5% of the journalists felt it was sufficient to look at the most important statistics of a match to gain a very approximate idea of what has happened without having seen it. However, a small percentage (30.8% and 12.5%, respectively) claimed that it is possible to know what a player is like simply by looking at his statistical record for passes, shots, victories, etc. That is, from this viewpoint, statistics do not cover or explain everything, but they may reveal interesting information.  3.2.2. The role of data in sports journalism The last point in this introductory section of the questionnaire is connected with the relationship between statistics and sports journalism: What role do the data have in sports news journalism? Although opinions vary a great deal about the use of data in these types of contents, there seems to be one fundamental premise: 88.5% of the Journalism students and 87.5% of the media professionals agree that data in sports journalism contents are very useful for supplementing and enriching basic information. Likewise, a large proportion of the participants in the study, 67.3% of future journalists and 56.25% of those who actually work in this profession, agree that a report or preview are always incomplete if they do not include important statistics.   3.2.3. Acceptance and comprehension of data journalism Although there seems to be some consensus as regards the importance of statistical sustenance within sports news, there is some discrepancy when it comes to understanding and accepting data journalism as a new modus operandi when covering events. This was made patent in the specific probabilistic model drawn up by El Pa\u00eds for the 2018 Football World Cup (Image 1), a work which, due to its originality and specific features, received both praise and criticism. The results gleaned from the questionnaire made with this research corroborate this. Firstly, up to 19.2% of students considered the model to be error-prone on the basis of the differences in the predicted results and those that finally appeared in the tournament. Meanwhile, the other 80.8% found the study the newspaper made interesting. However, within this latter percentage, 34.6% understood it as a serious piece of journalism as opposed to 46.2% who claimed that this use of data was not just for journalistic purposes.        301 Image 1: Predictions in the preview of the World Cup \n Source: Graph published by El Pa\u00eds on the 4th of June 2018.  The El Pa\u00eds prediction model surprised students. For instance, only 36.5% knew that data could be used to try to predict future events. However, this innovative way of using statistics in journalism is much more popular among professionals, 62.5% of whom claimed to be aware of it. However, the debate once again hinged on whether this use was for journalistic purposes or not, and this probabilistic model is a great example because neither Journalism students nor journalists reached agreement in this respect.  Chart 1: Evaluation of the students from the El Pa\u00eds predictive model. \n Source: prepared by the author  As seen in Charts 1 and 2, 56.25% of the professionals, and only 34.6% of students considered it to be a serious journalistic study, while 31.25% of professionals and 46.2% of students thought it was attractive despite being beyond the confines of strict journalism. The remaining 12.5% of journalists and 19.2% of students saw the model as useless and of no value.  \n 302 Chart 2: Evaluation of the journalists from the El Pa\u00eds predictive model. \n Source: prepared by the author  3.2.4. The journalistic value of results prediction  But, why did some journalists claim it definitely constituted journalism and others were not convinced that it fully adhered to journalistic codes and procedures, regardless of the degree to which the predicted results were fulfilled? Some of the professionals whose opinions were gathered in this research insisted there were limitations to the use of advanced statistics for informing and explaining events from a journalistic point of view.  For example, Mateo Gonz\u00e1lez, chief sports editor at ABC de Sevilla, claimed \u201cadvanced statistics is fine for noting trends and player-performance in a team at any given time, but daring to make a real prediction about the future is too risky and perhaps not in the best interests of journalism\u201d, which would even make the model \u201cborder on the world of sports bets\u201d. Also, Carles Vila, editor of Mundo Deportivo, mentions betting houses and considers the methodology used in the El Pa\u00eds model to be similar to the one used to establish stakes, so this model \u201ccould be used as a previous step to being informed about a result from another occasion, and is informative in that regard, but does not help much to give an overall explanation for the competition\u201d.  Likewise, V\u00edctor Garc\u00eda (El Confidencial) and Borja Pardo (Sphera Sports) agree that when working with data, this may provide excellent added value to the information, but they should never lay the foundations for it. Lastly, we turn to the view of Javier S\u00e1nchez, journalist at El Mundo, who sees it is only valuable in terms of providing a ranking for FIFA or a similar one, and that \u201cdata may be interesting for analysis and of slight interest to the reporter, but not for prediction\u201d, which is not really the work of a journalist. Defending the model from all this criticism (which might be thought reasonable, considering how new this is in Spanish journalism), Kiko Llaneras (2018), head of the project, claimed that once the World Cup had finished, it was truly reliable, because, for example, events which had a probability of between 0 and 10% of occurring, only occurred 3% of the time, while events which had a probability of over 75% occurred 86% of the time.  In this way, rather than expecting the results to be confirmed to see if they match the model predictions, what the debate is really concerned with is ascertaining the journalistic value these types of editorial approaches have. Figures do actually communicate (in this case, equality, uncertainty...) and moreover, they are important for dissemination purposes, since they attempt to explain a sports event in a different light, with data and by crossing variables.  According to Llaneras, journalists must not become obsessed with finding newsworthy events, but also explain them from another point of view while entertaining their readers. The truth is that many of the professionals who participated in this research seem to embrace that notion. Pablo Salvago, journalist at Diario de Sevilla, considers\u201cadvanced statistics has become one more tool for creating valid and even true news\u201d, which makes the El Pa\u00eds study a priori, \u201crigorous and objective\u201d. Also Cristina Caparr\u00f3s, at Sphera Sports, praises its attractiveness and diligence, stating \u201cit is not an opinion or procedure based on simple data, but, rather, a process which encompasses a range of factors in its methodology\u201d. \n 303 3.2.5. A second example of data journalism: control chart To better gauge the degree of difficulty of the El Pa\u00eds model, a second example of sports data journalism was attached to the questionnaire, which also gave rise to a range of different opinions. This was a chart which appeared in a short article by El Espa\u00f1ol in January 2016 (Image 2) which analysed the solid defence of Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid compared with other defences in the Spanish football league (3), crossing the shots against per match and shots against per goal scored for the different teams in the competition.  It was interesting to see how time passed for one of the most innovative data visualizations presented to date by this digital media, which in turn, was one of the first in Spain to commit to sports data journalism (Rojas-Torrijos and Rivera, 2016: 180). Therefore, there was an assessment of whether what was disruptive a few years ago (the chart becomes the focal point of the explanation, providing multiple readings from a combination of the variables and the text was minimalised as if it were a mere caption), is now better understood.   Image 2: Control chart \n Source: Chart published by El Pa\u00eds on the 20th of January 2016.  However, the results from the questionnaire clearly showed that this type of analysis and sports data visualization are not yet fully understood, even among the most typical users. Thus, Journalism students assessed the chart with an average difficulty of 3.9 on a scale from 1 to 5 with up to 50% allocating a difficulty of 4 and even 23.1% gave it the maximum difficulty (5). Yet more striking was the opinion of the professionals, as the average assessment of the difficulty they gave for this visualization was 3.75 (very similar to that given by the students), and up to 62.5% gave it a value of 4 or above. In order to check if the chart was really so complex as it seemed, the students were asked what, to their minds, was the message or main idea behind this visualization. Indeed, crossing the statistics, it might be concluded that Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid was the team which was most difficult to score a goal against, which speaks wonders about its defence strategy because two things happen at the same time: firstly, the team receives very few attack shots per match, and, secondly, it has to receive many shots before its opponents manage to score a goal.  Having said that, only 7.7% of students extracted this as the main idea, while 17.3% came close to giving the ideal response, since they clearly saw the red and white team had a solid defence, but were unable to get to the bottom of the matter. Also, 34.6% of students were unable to draw any clear conclusions from the chart, openly acknowledging that they did not know how to interpret it, while 7.7% tried to solve it, but did so erroneously, giving some responses that were totally incorrect. Finally, out of the remaining 32.8% of \n 304 respondents, rather vague responses were given, with which it could not be ascertained whether they had grasped the essential message of the chart or not, as some students just showed knowledge about the general idea (shots against received by the teams in the League) while others read it in alternative ways.  3.2.6. More information on data journalism for gaining an insight In light of these results, it was interesting to ask the professionals about the response given by the students and what this may have been due to. To be specific, the journalists were asked if the fact that most Journalism students were unable to interpret the chart was linked to shortcomings in their training or whether it was because the chart was too complex. Surprisingly, up to 56.25% of the journalists tended to indicate the latter option, as stressed, for example, by Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez Maldonado, sports editor at AS. He claimed that \"it is up to journalists and the media to ensure that their final product is understood by most of their recipients\" and that \"if most of them do not understand it, then an alternative must be sought\". As for, Javier S\u00e1nchez (El Mundo), he was convinced that although almost any reader could understand it, to do so, they had to stop and carefully examine it, so the effort required \u201ctime it is highly likely readers are not going to dedicate to it\u201d. Logically, then, the solution would be to try to simplify the chart or seek another method of displaying data, thereby adapting their level to their potential readers, as V\u00edctor Garc\u00eda (El Confidencial) adds. Meanwhile, some professionals thought the problem was mainly due to training. Enrique Juli\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, at Sphera Sports, believed that in the faculties \u201clittle training is given to students in statistics and mathematics, in general\u201d, and this is something which, in his opinion, is worrying for journalists because \u201cstatistics is an ever-more fundamental discipline for showing and interpreting reality and is therefore essential to journalism. Therefore, \"although it may be a complex chart for the average reader, a journalist must have a perfect and clear understanding of this type of statistical information\".  Concerning these shortcomings in training, Carles Vila commented on \u201cthe lack of experience the students have in handling data\u201d, which implies that it is still not typical for journalists to work on this specialism from an early stage. Finally, there were users who gave the same importance to the chart complexity problem as to possible shortcomings in training for future journalists, without putting any special emphasis on either of these two factors which are the main causes of this lack of understanding. Chart 3: Assessment of the functionality of the El Espa\u00f1ol chart (I) \n Source: prepared by the author Along with the degree of perceived difficulty, another point that was analysed was the function of the chart. That is, whether the two participating groups considered data visualization fulfilled its purpose of clearly representing the intended idea (the solidity of the defence of the two teams). Also, in this case, there was a wide range of opinions. As shown in Chart 3, only 17.3% of students thought the visualization completely fulfilled this purpose. They understood that a defence which enables fewer goal opportunities is a more solid one; while 57.7% of them believed it was useful because it could explain a variable of the game related to defence work, but it did not totally fulfil the initial purpose of digital media; and according to 25% of them, the chart was no good for that purpose, as in their view, just because a team receives fewer shots does not necessarily mean they defend better. \n 305 Chart 4: Assessment of the functionality of the El Espa\u00f1ol chart (II) \n Source: prepared by the author As for the professionals, their percentages were 25%, 68.75% and 6.25% respectively (see Chart 4), which shows us that the vast majority considered this data work to be interesting, although they remained unconvinced as they did not think the idea was represented in the most appropriate way.  3.2.7. The future of sports data journalism  The last section of this research consisted in an open-ended question expressly made to professionals in order to know whether, at present, they see the establishment of data journalism  as a work technique for the editorial teams of Spanish media as viable.  While, there were testimonials, like that from Antonio Medina (Estadio Deportivo), who believed that \u201cdata journalism is already very established in the editorial departments at least those for sports\u201d, and that even \u201cmore news comes from it than statement-based journalism\u201d, the vast majority of professionals disagreed: they considered data journalism in Spain had still not made that leap forward and that its use in the media was still too marginal for it to be considered as significant. However, regarding the future of Spanish data journalism, some of the views expressed showed optimism. Hence, Victor Garcia, indicated that data were becoming increasingly important in our society and, therefore, they were ever more crucial to journalism. Meanwhile, for Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez Maldonado, the establishment of data journalism in sports news was perfectly viable. In fact, he believed this might happen very soon if we bear in mind that \u201chandling big data has become ever more widespread in the world of sport\u201d.  There are other journalists who seriously considered this possibility, albeit with important qualifications. For example, Juan Luis Rodr\u00edguez (El Pa\u00eds) stated that while scarcity of resources remains the predominant trend in journalism, just \u201cthose media which can afford to allocate human resources to data journalism\u201d can implement it with their editorial teams. Carles Vila was convinced that it would only become a reality if journalists felt the need to develop it. Finally, Javier S\u00e1nchez believed that it would be successful but not in sports journalism in particular, since, to his mind, statistics did not contribute much to general-interest media articles, which did not need to enter into highly technical points. Lastly, several of the professionals participating in the study understood that there was little room for data journalism nowadays in Spain. Economics was the most common reason cited for justifying this argument, but there were also many allusions to the tastes of the target audience. So, according to Eduardo Casado, journalist at 20 Minutos, before we talk of growth in data journalism \u201cpublic interest must be aroused, and for the time being, these data or statistics are viewed as being something merely anecdotal\u201d. Likewise, he talked about \"re-educating\" this public, which \"was still more interested in more\" amateur aspects of sports information.  \n 306 4. Discussion  As we have seen in the research results, there is no univocal perception about data journalism among the different target groups researched, the typical consumers of sports information. The differences shown in the degree of acceptance and comprehension about the use of advanced techniques for visualization and data prediction, specifically looking at El Pa\u00eds during its coverage of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, led to a discussion on three key issues: firstly, the usefulness and news value of probability as a concept accepted by journalists; secondly, the editorial commitment that the media is willing to make to nurture the use of data journalism in news reports; and, thirdly, the challenges posed by the development of this new category of journalism for editorial teams for the university training of future professionals. Firstly, as the results showed, future development of data journalism in the field of sports news in Spain is facing one of its most information challenges which is to become established as a typical modus operandi for specialized professional editorial teams. This way, as indicated by different studies, it will follow in the footsteps of the media in other parts of the world, especially the Anglo-Saxons (Rojas-Torrijos and Rivera, 2016: 173), but also other countries like Germany (Horky and Pelka, 2017) or Scandinavia (Fink and Anderson, 2015), where sports data journalism is already established in the daily cycle of news production as an emerging field of innovation which has brought new ways of telling stories, gathering information and broadcasting news (Segel and Heer, 2010; Borges-Rey, 2016).  However, for the editorial team to implement this, data journalism must also become part of the professional mindset. They must explore the new possibilities different technologies provide to make such journalism possible and also accept new ways of thinking and working as an integral part of the innovation process (Gynnild, 2013). Therefore, data journalism will be transferred and \"made much more visible to news consumers\u201d (Bradshaw, 2015: 202).  Obviously, this is a process which will take time and entail training future professionals at universities, who have responded to the questions in this research and also state the need to improve training on this matter in the study plans for Journalism. As stated by different authors, Journalism studies must keep abreast of changes in technology, and requires permanent and critical updating which is in keeping with the new digital panorama and the reality of media companies (L\u00f3pez, 2012; Saavedra, Grijalba and Pedrero, 2018).   While this is gradually implemented, professionals will clearly perceive the important potential which lies in data journalism for providing new approaches and for covering sports events, especially football, given the large volume of data that revolve around competitions and also the cyclical and repetitive nature of matches. The statistical character of football competitions in recent years has helped develop automization technologies from the generation of natural language by many sports editorial teams, which produce reports of roboticized data (Graefe, 2016; T\u00fa\u00f1ez, Toural and Cacheiro, 2018; Rojas-Torrijos and Toural, 2019).  As it is added to the creation and distribution of contents processes in the Spanish sports media, this technology also means professionals must accept new methods and work routines based on handling and analysing data with informational purposes, so that, later on, these can be effectively communicated to their respective audiences. Specifically, the statistical model presented by El Pa\u00eds gave a journalistic value to probability and tried to innovate when seeking how uncertainty could be communicated, but different degrees of acceptance and comprehension among users were found. The research developed herein, despite covering the phenomenon of sports data journalism from a new perspective, such as the degree to which it is perceived as a specific journalistic initiative by its target audiences, has been limited in scope. Firstly, the sample of the audience that participated in this research could be extended to students at other universities in Spain, so that different perceptions of the same news category for covering competitions may be shared and evaluated.  Moreover, the study was based on just one situation which, although it is innovative and concerns a leading newspaper such as El Pa\u00eds in important coverage such as the Football World Cup, it is susceptible to comparison with other similar models developed by different communication media in their sports coverage, not just football. In this respect, future lines of research should be set on using data journalism for other important sports events such as the Olympic Games or world cups in other disciplines.  5. Conclusions The results enabled the state of play for data journalism for the sports editorial teams in Spanish media to be confirmed via the responses gathered to the two questions set at the onset of this research.  307 Firstly, the apparition of data journalism as a journalistic technique within the field of sports news in Spain is still in its fledgling years and, generally speaking, it seems that typical consumers of this type of contents, as stated in their responses to the questionnaires made, have still not become used to news spots whose main features are data analysis and visualizations of statistical variables. Due to this reality, these contents are often perceived as so inaccessible and complex, they seem to be difficult to understand.  Perhaps the most important point is it is not just amateur consumers in university education who are still in the process of coming to grips with this new category of journalistic work, but also media professionals themselves do not seem to agree on the meaning of data journalism, its potential for the present and future, as well as its value and news purposes.  In this respect, the innovative nature of the results prediction model developed by El Pa\u00eds during the Football World Cup in Russia came up against an audience that was neither sufficiently accustomed to it nor prepared to fully take in and interpret it, nor was it given the journalistic value the project promoters, especially Kiko Llaneras, had hoped for by setting this innovative model in motion.  However, the evaluation of the model made by El Pa\u00eds on comparing it with other similar ones which other media and international companies developed for the World Cup was very positive. From the newspaper itself, they argued that their model was finely gauged, since its initial predictions of low probability corresponded with event which almost never happened. Also, it never promised to be more accurate than it actually was. Llaneras himself made it clear that one thing is calculating probabilities which have a news value and another very different thing is making mere conjectures and perhaps this was one of the reasons why the model was not well understood. Secondly, the study results supported the idea that data journalism is an upcoming category of work which has great potential for development within Spanish sports journalism in forthcoming years. The different audiences consulted agreed, stressing the valuable contributions which may be provided by a data analysis of sports coverage, which not just helps create new stories and ways of building and telling information, but also the graphic resources created, enrich them visually. In short, a greater future implementation of data by the editorial teams of sports news in Spain would imply tackling coverage of the main events from an original and innovative perspective. This potential does not just mean sports information is moving towards accurate, quality journalism, but also makes its contents more attractive and arouses greater interest among its most typical consumers.  6.

The dramatic technological revolution has had a profound impact on society and, consequently, has caused changes in communication management within the frame of Brazilian organizations. Information and Communication technologies (ICTs) have become relevant facilitators in the communication process. This scenario has compelled Public Relations programmes to adopt new tools and methodologies to support teaching practices required to address the new students\u2019 learning profiles. Research conducted using qualitative and quantitative methodologies highlighted the adoption of new technologies as the preferred strategies for motivating and inducing student interest and for addressing the digital transformation of communication. For today\u2019s organizations, the new technologies have also led to an increased demand for transparency by the users. Notwithstanding the importance of the new technologies, their effectiveness is conditioned on their full integration into the academic development of each student. The reflection on the role of Information and Communication technologies in the context of Public Relations should focus not solely on new tools and methodologies but also on the preparation of competent professionals able to create better communications for society as a whole.  Investigaciones acerca de la incorporaci\u00f3n de plataformas digitales en las carreras de Relaciones P\u00fablicas es algo reciente en Brasil. La vertiginosa revoluci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica ha impactado la sociedad y, como consecuencia, ha provocado cambios en la gesti\u00f3n de la comunicaci\u00f3n en las organizaciones. Las Tecnolog\u00edas de Informaci\u00f3n y Comunicaci\u00f3n (TICs) se han convertido en grandes facilitadoras del proceso comunicacional. Ese escenario ha obligado a las carreras de Relaciones P\u00fablicas a adoptar nuevas metodolog\u00edas y herramientas para apoyar las pr\u00e1cticas pedag\u00f3gicas frente al nuevo perfil de los estudiantes. Es sobre ese trasfondo que se realiz\u00f3 la presente investigaci\u00f3n, que emple\u00f3 una combinaci\u00f3n de t\u00e9cnicas cuantitativas y cualitativas. Los resultados destacan la adopci\u00f3n de tecnolog\u00edas como estrategia para motivar el inter\u00e9s de los estudiantes y para responder a la transformaci\u00f3n digital de la comunicaci\u00f3n de las organizaciones contempor\u00e1neas, una vez que los p\u00fablicos exigen cada vez m\u00e1s transparencia. Cabe destacar, sin embargo, que, pese a que las tecnolog\u00edas est\u00e9n consideradas importantes aportes, su eficacia debe estar condicionada a su plena integraci\u00f3n en el proceso formativo del estudiante. A modo de conclusi\u00f3n, la reflexi\u00f3n acerca de las TICs en el \u00e1mbito de la pr\u00e1ctica de las Relaciones P\u00fablicas debe estar centrada no solo en nuevas herramientas, sino en la capacidad de las carreras para preparar profesionales capaces de producir una mejor comunicaci\u00f3n a la sociedad.

Introduction Digital technology has changed the conditions of knowledge generation and information processing in contemporary society (Castells, 2002). This has modified the way and speed with which people communicate (Rosas Ch\u00e1vez, 2017). As Castells (2002) points out, this technological revolution has impacted how institutions and organizations process information, generate knowledge, and use Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). In regards to formal education, technologies have transformed social interactions and access to information beyond classroom walls; likewise, new ways of teaching and learning that underscore the interaction between real and virtual life have also emerged (Tezani, 2017). The impact of ICTs in the educational system has created educational methods capable of improving the quality of education for students and revolutionizing the way information is obtained, handled and interpreted. As Prensky (2001) explains, generations born in the digital age, that is, so-called digital natives, are characterized as capable of multitasking and being selective regarding information. In addition, they do not choose activities solely based on a perceived benefit and seek satisfaction in their endeavors. Students of this new generation may experience difficulties concentrating for long periods in class lectures; they fail to read extensively and use technologies excessively, which competes with other activities such as critical thinking while reading and problem solving. In analyzing the professional practice of public relations in Brazil, we find a very specialized profession with a premise rooted in ethics and transparency in relationship management, which prizes the role of the scenario analyst (Ferrari, 2011) and plays a highly strategic role in weighing public perceptions of an organization (Grunig, 2011). With the advent of digital technology, the public relations function in organizations began to incorporate a series of digital instruments and platforms that on one hand facilitated the work of communicators, but on the other increased its vulnerability as it became impossible to monitor all the information produced in this new environment (Paskin, 2013). As a result, communicators will likely be unable to process the amount of data and information, which can easily generate fake news, a phenomenon very typical of the \u201cpost-truth\u201d era (Men\u00e9ndez, Peiro, Berbell and Serrano Mart\u00ednez, 2018). Considering the new role of the public relations professional in the digital age (DiStaso, Stacks and Botan, 2009; Paskin, 2013; Kunsch, 2017), the objectives of this article are to identify the incorporation of technology in pedagogical practices to foster learning in public relations programs, identify technological tools selected by professors in the classroom, and verify the work infrastructure with digital platforms. It should be noted that empirical research on pedagogical practices and technology in teaching-learning processes in public relations programs in Brazil is scarce (Ferrari, 2017a). Similar studies published in scientific journals in the country have not been found. For this reason, the results presented in this article are unpublished and serve to (re)think teaching-learning methods and technological tools that promote interaction between teacher and student. Two questions guided the research: What methodologies do public relations professors use to approach digital students and prepare them for contemporary organizations? And what tools do professors adopt in their pedagogical practices? The text identifies the transformations of higher education in Brazil in public relations academic programs and presents the results obtained through a two-phase research process, one quantitative and the other qualitative, together with professors of the Brazilian public relations programs. The research was conducted between 2016 and 2018 and financed by the The S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (Fapesp, for its acronym in Portuguese).   1.2. Observations on higher education in Brazil in recent decades Higher education in Brazil has undergone important change starting from 1990 as a result of national regulations aimed to adapt to global conceptions of continuing education. This led to the introduction of lifelong learning incentives, and the inclusion of technology in professor and student training, thus highlighting the importance of people's continued experiences beyond formal education (Coll, 2013). The economic opening of the country, intensified by the privatization of higher education, resulted in an increase in the number of undergraduate programs, technological programs, and the inclusion of blended and distance learning (Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais An\u00edsio Teixeira [Inep], 2014). This reality reveals the relevance that technologies have attained in Brazilian education today, which have extended the learning possibilities of students in their personal and professional training. In response, higher  313 education institutions (HEIs) have attempted to implement policies that include the diversification of educational modalities and the integration of open resources, tools and digital platforms in the teaching-learning process. Against this backdrop, higher level programs received curricular guidelines that awarded special attention to the profiles of graduates based on competencies and flexibility of curricula. From this perspective, we sought to underscore the need for lifelong learning in a context of constant socio-labor transformations (Coll, 2013). To train future citizens and professionals, it is vital to abandon the closed curriculum model containing fragmented subjects.   1.3. Public relations in Brazil: The role of academia in the assesment of professional practice The history of public relations in Brazil is different from that of other countries in the world. The profession began in 1914 with the establishment of the public relations department at the Canadian company Light & Power in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo (Ferrari, 2017a). Up until 1960, the practice of the profession had been in the hands of amateurs who sought knowledge by making trips to other countries or attending short courses promoted by the School of Business, Economics and Accounting at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation, the Institute of Labor Organization and the Pontificial Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. Between 1964 and 1985, also known as the \u201clead years\u201d, Brazil was ruled by a repressive military dictatorship that curbed freedom of expression in the media and assumed control of the entire information system. In 1967, within the context of authoritarianism, Law 5.377 was created to establish the regulation of the public relations profession. The idea was to define \"who does what\", with the clear intention of controlling \"who does it\". Other Latin American countries, however, did not follow the example of Brazil, which became the first country to adopt specific legislation for the practice of public relations. In that same year, the first higher degree program was created at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. In this context, it is worth highlighting the creation of the Federal Council of Public Relations Professionals (Conferp, for its acronym in Portuguese) and its regional councils in 1969, whose function was and continues to be the supervision of the profession. Thus, in accordance with Law 5.377, the practice of the profession is limited to those who hold an undergraduate degree in public relations and the respective professional registration granted by the CONFERP system. The creation of specific legislation and an undergraduate degree played a catalytic role in the growth of teaching and promotion of scientific research in public relations in Brazil. The first Master's degree program was created in the 1970s, which was followed in 1980 by a PhD program in Communications, with an emphasis on public relations. The boom in academic growth in public relations occurred in 2009, when there were 112 higher-level programs in the entire country. Since then, the number has dropped considerably, mostly in private HEIs, from 75 in 2014 to 53 in 2018. The curriculum structure of public relations programs in Brazil does not include specific subjects for teacher training since the program\u2019s profile is primarily focused on the student's entry into the business world. Post graduate programs in the strictest sense, i.e. master\u2019s degree and doctorate programs, emphasize student-led research rather than specific professor training (Ferrari, 2017a). Historically, the training of professors of public relations programs in Brazil has been based on knowledge obtained at the undergraduate level, which has long been considered sufficient to train teachers for that educational level. This mentality dismisses the acquisition of necessary pedagogical knowledge for the teaching practice, which can result in countless distortions in daily practices. Starting in 2013, public relations programs in Brazil began to adopt new curricular guidelines that moved program directors towards a pedagogical reformulation. The proposals highlighted the integration of theory and practice, the introduction of interdisciplinary projects, the reinforcement of language, media and technology skills, and laboratory activities that allow the development of professional practice experiences. Specific competencies required for the program include the following: knowledge of techniques and instruments specific to the development of the public relations practice and understanding of technological innovations (Parecer 85, 2013). In light of contemporary social dynamics, the inclusion of ICTs came to be considered essential for public relations curricula. However, this poses a challenge for professors in the field since not all master these technologies (V. Rhoden and J. Rhoden, 2017). The new context overthrows the traditional vision and gives rise to other forms of practicing teaching today and in the future. Public and private organizations, NGOs  314 and communication agencies are looking for public relations professionals who are proficient in technology and are capable of dealing with big data in increasingly shorter times (Kunsch, 2017). In a study on the most valued skills among public relations students as described by professionals in the field, Paskin (2013: 252) points out that both traditional and new skills should be combined with the concept of convergence in mind. The author states, \"teach students writing, research and planning by using Facebook and Twitter; explain newsletters through graphic design and Photoshop; explain crisis management while publishing a blog\". In a study conducted in Brazil, Vergili (2014) highlighted that future public relations professionals need to build relationships with publics of interest on social networks; to this purpose, he suggested learning and using metrics, content analysis, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), as well as a programming language. According to \u00c1lvarez-Flores, N\u00fa\u00f1ez-G\u00f3mez and Olivares-Santamarina (2018), the digital evolution forced communicators to shape their professional profiles with competences to create, transform and distribute information through various traditional and digital media. For example, today\u2019s professionals need to be able to understand the flow of audiences on the Internet, manage simultaneous identities on social platforms, and work and collaborate remotely. With this, new job opportunities abound for public relations professionals. According to Coll (2013), it is important to take into account the variety of formal and informal education options available to professors so they can achieve qualified learning, such as virtual platforms and tools that help with communication and collaboration (Berm\u00fadez-Rodr\u00edguez and Fueyo-Guti\u00e9rrez, 2018). Digital resources can facilitate the transmission of knowledge (Quintanilha, 2017), such as the educational tool Moodle, digital platforms (Google Drive, Dropbox, Issuu), social networks (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) and applications (WhatsApp). To this purpose, the professor needs to be aware of and know how to use the technological tools available so they can be used daily in class to stimulate the learning process (Zabalza, 2007; Paskin, 2013; V. Rhoden and J. Rhoden, 2017), such as discussion forums or application development. Professors need to understand the current influence of technologies on social reality, and know how to take advantage of the use of certain pedagogical practices (Salcines-Talledo, Gonz\u00e1lez-Fern\u00e1ndez and Briones, 2017). Cobo and Moravec emphasize that contemporary social demands cannot be met solely with a traditional model of education, be it face-to-face or virtual, in which professors speak to their students. The authors emphasize that: the traditional model of education needs to be considered from new perspectives. This does not mean adding an \"e-\" at the beginning to make it better. Nor is it enough to acquire certain technological devices or incorporate some international quality certification or standard. Education demands ecological, systemic, long-term improvement that is also inclusive (Cobo and Moravec, 2011: 19-20, translation). Bringing together teaching-learning methodologies and technological supports (Masetto and Zukowsky-Tavares, 2015; Zabalza, 2007) allows pedagogical practices to be more motivating and promotes the creativity of students. When professors understand the potential of using these languages and codes, it will be possible to increase the production of students, who will come to understand the construction of knowledge as a path towards learning (Marcelo, 2013). In the compilation of Brazilian literature on public relations, two innovative proposals that used technology as a pedagogical support were identified. The first is the \u201cPublic Relations and Management Simulator\u201d (SimRPG), developed in a doctoral thesis that proposed the use of business games adapted to the public relations field through the use of software where students simulate management activities monitored by the professor (A. Grohs and L. Grohs, 2019). The second is the \u201cPublic Relations in Cinema Portal\u201d, an extension project created as a repository of educational content on public relations themes in which the professor has a script of contents and practical activities (Silva and Henriques, 2018). It is also worth mentioning the development of a joint project between the Advertising and Public Relations degree at the University of Seville (Spain) and the Public Relations degree at the Paulista State University (Brazil) called \"From class to account\" (www.delaclasealacuenta.com). Students from both institutions organized themselves into agencies to plan and develop a campaign for a real client. To do this, they created different content, in e-learning and blended formats, with activities carried out remotely with the mediation of ICTs. Professors used electronic platforms to share texts and videos to motivate the creation of discussion groups from a flipped classroom perspective. At the end of each edition, the agencies' proposals were presented at an international event broadcast live for both institutions and evaluated by  315 Brazilian and Spanish juries (Cabral, Ruiz, Santos, Por\u00e9m, Andrelo and Guaraldo, 2017). The initiative also aimed to foster intercultural communication between the two groups of students and evaluate the relationships between students and professors through daily practices, the use of language, and ICTs as contact support between the agencies. The previously mentioned examples demonstrate that technology has the ability to modify the role of the professor who, through the use of ICTs, assumes the role of \u201ccounselor\u201d. This modified role favors a new relationship with students in which they cease acting as receivers to assume a leading role in the process (Gil, 2013). According to Casablancas (2017), transformations in the field of pedagogy occur from the bottom-up; that is, it is students who, through their own demands, push professors to bring technologies to the classroom. However, being a professor in higher education requires more than mastering technology, since the three activities mentioned reinforce the complexity of the pedagogical practice of teaching and the need for contextualization (Louren\u00e7o, Lima and Narciso, 2016) both in relation to sociocultural aspects as well as new business models.  2. Metholodogy Since 2015, we have been conducting a range of studies to learn more about the training path of public relations students in Brazil, and identify teaching-learning methods and the use of technologies applied by professors in these programs. The objective of this article is to reflect on the link between the use of pedagogical practices adopted by the professor and learning technologies in public relations programs. The study was divided into two stages. In the first, a quantitative technique was used with a questionnaire addressed to professors of public relations programs in Brazil. The instrument contained 33 questions (23 closed and ten open-ended) that addressed the professor\u2019s profile, work routine, pedagogical notions, and teaching methods, based on the classification of Gil (2013). After conducting a pretest with five professors selected at random and, after making adjustments, the questionnaire was distributed through the Survio platform between August and November 2016. The survey was answered by 255 professors (75% out of a total of 342 professors), which represented approximately 80% of the public relations programs in the country (see appendix). Of the 255 professors, 164 (64%) worked in private HEIs and 91 (36%) in public HEIs. The information collected was processed with the support of the statistical software Minitab and SPSS. The second stage featured a qualitative approach and consisted of interviews with professors selected based on the following profile: holding a degree in public relations and being responsible for teaching specific subjects of the program such as Strategic Planning and Theory and History of Public Relations. The script for the interview questions included the profile of the professor, the course, teaching-learning practices, use of digital tools, and results observed with students. Between March and July 2018, 22 interviews were conducted with professors who agreed to participate in the study. The interviews lasted an average of 60 minutes and were conducted in person or via Skype or Hangout, depending on the availability of the professors and the interviewers. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Afterward, categories for content analysis were established according to Bardin (2016) and detailed in item 3.1.  3. Results The responses collected in the quantitative phase revealed that the best-known pedagogical methods among professors were lectures given by the professor, discussion and debates, case studies, seminars, and readings, respectively. The most frequently adopted practices were lectures given by the professor, discussions and debates, case studies, reading of texts and seminars, as presented in Figure 1.    316 Figure 1: Most well-known and used teaching methods \n Source: Authors.  The responses indicate the predominance of \u201clectures given by the professor\u201d, which is explained by the following factors: economy of financial resources of the institution and the emphasis on the one-way transmission of content taught by the professor. The lecture-based teaching method is founded on the classic assumption that oral teaching is the best way to teach. However, one of the main criticisms of this method is the passivity of the student (Gil, 2013). A greater degree of participation is not required in the teaching-learning process and the student usually concentrates only on assimilation of knowledge, which reduces the stimulus of critical thinking needed for questioning and the construction of arguments. Regarding technological supports of information and communication adopted in teaching methods, the Data show was named as the most used resource by 95% of the professors, as indicated in Figure 2.   \nOthers  PBL - Problem-based learning   Games and simulations  Long Distance Learning  Dynamic activities/ dramatizations  Conceptual maps and brainstorming  Integrated projects   Video and image analysis   Monitored technical visits  Field research   Reading   Seminars    Case studies   Debates and discussions  Lectures \nMost used \nMost well known  317 Figure 2: Reaching resources used by professors \n Source: Authors.  Less than a third of professors use social networks, images and a computer lab. Educational software stands out next, used by only 2% of the respondents. The fact that these resources are used by few professors may be related to insufficient funds for the acquisition of equipment and training for professors.   3.1. Pedagogical practices  In the second phase of the study, a qualitative approach was adopted to carefully analyze professors\u2019 pedagogical notions, including teaching-learning practices, technological tools selected for the classroom, and whether the HEIs where the professors worked were well equipped for the adoption of digital tools and platforms. To present the results of this phase, we used the content analysis proposed by Bardin (2016), which follows the order of pre-analysis, exploration and interpretation of materials. Next, the transcribed content of the interviews was coded and then the context categories were defined under the premise of presence of terms mentioned by the professors, not necessarily the frequency with which the terms appeared in their responses. Of the 22 interviewees, 16 were women and six were men. It was found that the fields of communications and mainly public relations have more female representation than male (Grunig, 2011). Fourteen of the 22 respondents had a doctoral degree and eight had a master's degree. In terms of years of experience as professors, five had less than 10 years of experience; ten had more than ten years, and seven had between 20 and 30 years of experience. To preserve the confidentiality of the respondents, the letter P was used to refer to the professors (P1 to P22). When asked about the teaching-learning methods they had adopted, the respondents reported that they use a variety of methods in their subjects. Table 1 presents an organization of the methods freely cited by the different professors and the frequency with which they were cited, since one professor mentioned more than one method during the interview.    \nOthers  Photography Lab   Educative Software  Audiovisual Lab   Computer Lab  Images   Social Media  Videos and Music   Whiteboard  Newspapers, magazines, and recent events published in the media  Texts and abstracts  Data show  318 Table 1: Methods used by professors PRACTICES MENTIONS Flipped classroom 9 Dramatization 8 Lectures 7 Games  7 Simulation  7 Conceptual maps 5 Technical visits 5 Debate groups 4 Digital platforms 4 Seminar 4 Reading  3 Situation-problem 3 Distance learning 2 Case studies 2 Movie viewing 1 Workshop 1 Source: Authors.  Some of the methods, including games, flipped classroom, technical visits, simulation and dramatization were cited in all regions of the country. According to Masetto and Zukowsky-Tavares (2015: 21, translation), professors\u2019 knowledge of methods can \u201cfacilitate and intensify student learning through varied techniques in face-to-face and virtual environments, as well as energize pedagogical action and allow the development of multiple facets of learning\u201d. When questioned about their perception of student involvement based on the different pedagogical methods adopted, all of the respondents, except P14, stated that students had adopted an active and positive position towards learning with innovative practices. It is worth highlighting P9's statement about positive factors when he stated, \u201cI have noticed that, for the student, the class becomes more dynamic because I do not offer answers, but I ask questions. Because I think that the student becomes much more interested upon realizing that what he or she contributes is useful\u201d. Regarding why professors started to introduce technology in classes, it was pointed out that students felt more motivated, and that technology gained their attention (as confirmed by Pe\u00f1alva, Aguaded and Torres-Toukoumidis (2019) in a study on gamification in university teaching). The motivational factor was highlighted as a lever for the introduction of technologies in the classroom in response to student interest. According to the interviewees, it is the students who ask the professor to introduce technologies in teaching. Quintanilla (2017: 260, translation) clarifies that these differentiated practices allow students to act with \u201cautonomy in the development of a project and in the creation of a product that, of course, contributes to the incorporation of new learning or the strengtening of what already exists\u201d. One of the professors interviewed, P15, mentioned other positive aspects that result from the application of these methods, such as \u201cthe student acquires a differentiated position. A priori, a certain degree of inhibition, but then more security in terms of his or her capacity, better positioning and greater participation\u201d. Along the same lines, P3 stated that \u201cthe student feels totally motivated. I realize that the dynamics change, the conventional classroom is no longer so biased. What I see is that a large number of students like it, the class improves, it is another construction. My assessment as a professor is better\u201d. In contrast, P3 pointed out that the adoption of these practices can also create problems: \"I realize that certain students show resistance, because the traditional system in the classroom is ingrained\". These statements align with Pe\u00f1alva, Aguaded and Torres-Toukoumidis (2019: 254, translation), who reported: Students also experience, at first, resistance to the use of active methodologies and the use of gamification in the classroom, because they have been in a rigid system for many years where they have assumed the role of listeners. In the end, students become involved in new learning systems and do not want to go back to traditional methods.   319 The experience of working with different teaching methods that motivate students in the classroom makes professors more likely to adopt these technologies in the learning process (Pe\u00f1alva, Aguaded and Torres-Toukoumidis, 2019).   3.2. The use of technologies  According to Rosas Ch\u00e1vez (2017), over time, educational institutions have struggled to incorporate advancements in science, knowledge and technology; these adaptations to new environments are what, in turn, have determined new progress in these fields. Perhaps the greatest impact and usefulness that ICT innovation has had in education is the large amount of information that can be accessed through the internet, according to a study by Hilbert and L\u00f3pez (2011). More than 20 years ago, the first digital technologies were introduced in Brazilian HEIs to support the work of professors. Back then, many came to advocate for the professor\u2019s disappearance. It has already been said that the use of technologies has allowed the professor to assume a new role in the current scenario: that of counselor. ICTs function as \"amplifiers\" of all the elements of education. Although technologies have come to support personal and professional development, thus allowing individuals to reduce physical barriers and intensify communication flows, it must be recognized that their usage does not guarantee that the needs in the immediate environment and the demands of higher education will be met\u2014yet, there is no turning back (Berm\u00fadez-Rodr\u00edguez and Fueyo-Guti\u00e9rrez, 2018). The interviews sought to determine to what extent professors of public relations programs subscribe to the use of digital platforms in their classes to transmit knowledge, experiences and to bring theory to practice. It is also worth noting that, with the adoption of ICTs, public relations practices in organizations in Brazil have changed radically in recent years. Social networks have allowed a multiplication of dialogue and information channels with audiences, as well as the upsurge of new interaction and entertainment tools on digital platforms. This brings greater opportunities for public relations professionals to structure a more effective and balanced communication with different audiences. In terms of findings, three of the professors stated they do not use digital media, and one did not answer the question. Instead, the majority of the respondents affirmed that they adopt different educational platforms or educational tools simultaneously. WhatsApp was the most cited medium, with a total of seven references. Table 2 presents the other tools used in the classroom mentioned by the professors during the interview, since more than one technology was cited by each of the interviewees. Table 2: Technologies used by professors TOOL MENTIONS WhatsApp  7 Facebook  6 Email  5 Research platforms 4 Moodle  4 Blackboard 3 Mobile 2 Blog, Google Drive, debate group, Kahoot, online material, PowerPoint, Sisgrade, evaluation site, YouTube 1 (each) Source: Authors.  In a society where people are constantly connected, either through smartphones or through notebooks, it is important to know, especially in higher education environments, the right time to use these technologies to better manage platforms and strike a balance between entertainment and knowledge. As one respondent (P4) pointed out, \u201cI always seek to put myself in the other person\u2019s position and transfer these actions to organizations; think about what you will do tomorrow as a professional, what will your level of responsibility be, how can you disconnect from other topics, because there are things that are parallel and on a personal level. So I spend a lot of time reflecting on this, not only with regard to technology, but also more generally\u201d. With this same perspective, P17 observed, \u201cI love technologies, I think they are extremely positive. A communication professional has no choice: he or she is obliged to work with these technologies. Otherwise, he or she will lose their spot to those who have put in the time to learn them. They may not know much  320 about communication, and they may not know much about relationships, but they know how to work with software\u201d. P11 admitted to only using research platforms, noting that, \u201cI think they can help in certain situations. But I don't think we should feel compelled to use them. In certain situations, they are relevant and helpful, of course, but in others, they are not\u201d. Along the same lines, P1 stressed, \u201cWe use them at certain times when they become necessary for the subject. It won\u2019t be all the time, because we also live in a society where students use their mobile phone as if it were an extension of their own body. We also complain, because while we are clarifying something, the students have their mobile in their hand. But if the situation demands it, it is clear we use technology\u201d. P8 underscored an important point by commenting, \u201cI think it would be inconsistent for me to ban it. We study communication, which goes through technological interfaces, and that\u2019s why it wouldn\u2019t make sense\u201d, mainly in the present public relations context where one must be part of the digital universe to best understand an organization\u2019s audience. Among the tools that provide learning opportunities mediated by technology, P13 mentioned the adoption of Kahoot (a learning platform based on games used in the classroom. For more details, see Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez, 2017) and comments, \u201cit is very easy to use with questions that must be answered in a certain amount of time, like a test; if it is not answered, points are lost. But I have only used Kahoot a few times because it takes work; then there is the question of time. I wish I could use it more\". This comment corroborates the discussion undertaken by Pe\u00f1alva, Aguaded and Torres-Toukoumidis (2019), who have pointed to the modest implementation of gamification in universities and the scarcity of studies in the field of communications, with the majority of research coming from departments of technology, engineering and architecture. The most important objectives cited among the respondents regarding the use of technologies as mediating instruments in the teaching-learning process include strengthening relationships with students, encouraging them to be more active, creating opportunities to apply new knowledge to real-life situations, presenting new concepts and knowledge in multiple ways, and enabling learning through collaboration. It is worth noting that new teaching methods, including those based on ICTs, involve creating a framework of competence to face the challenges of the century and promote lifelong education. This framework of competencies calls for a professional profile in which interpersonal skills, the ability to learn new languages and flexibility to act in the face of uncertainty play a fundamental role. According to Universia Per\u00fa (2013), the ability to manage time, active learning and judgment and decision-making are among the most high-priority skills since they will significantly increase labor productivity (Rosas Ch\u00e1vez, 2017).  These competencies are part of the set of attributes that companies, communication agencies and non-profit organizations seek in the hiring of public relations professionals in Brazil. In one study, Ferrari (2017b) observed that, currently, communication executives seek to employ communicators who demonstrate professional ethical responsibility and the ability to plan and manage projects (corroborating a previous study on education in public relations conducted in the United States by DiStaso, Stacks and Botan, 2009). Both competencies take on special significance in a \u201cpost-truth\u201d society, where the immediate and excessive transmission of information can jeopardize the stability and reputation of an organization.   3.3. Available infrastructure The interviews revealed that the use of technologies in the classroom depends on a variety of factors, such as the professor\u2019s knowledge of the content, the context of the subject taught and its relationship with the other subjects in the semester, the context of the HIEs, and the available infrastructure. For this reason, it is important that the pedagogical understanding of the professor and the institution are coherent, so as to allow the adoption of different teaching-learning methods with their respective technological supports. The research also analyzed classroom and laboratory infrastructure to determine if the existing infrastructure allowed the adoption of new pedagogical practices for student learning. Sixteen of the 22 respondents mentioned that their HEIs have adequate infrastructure for the adoption of different practices and use of digital tools or platforms. A large portion of the 16 respondents belong to private HEIs, which, unlike public HEIs, privilege specific areas as a means of \"attracting students\". One of the respondents (P9) reported, \"there are areas for computers, technological infrastructure, rooms for qualitative research, rooms with mirrors for simulation  321 and debate groups\", which confirms that the institution has a variety of physical spaces to promote the development of its students. Six of the respondents stated that their institution does not have proper infrastructure. Some HEIs do not have equipment due to lack of funds, as indicated by P8. Some institutions have equipment, but not the best of conditions for other reasons, as P5 reports: \u201cthere is equipment, but physical space is limited\". P19 adds, \"the infrastructure of the institution is in poor condition, there are few computers for many students\". In summary, it is observed that, for many of the respondents, technologies are indispensable tools in the current scenario, either to allow a better quality teaching-learning process, or to prepare professionals for the workforce. It is essential that HEIs have a minimally appropriate structure and promote a culture that allows the adoption of new practices by professors.   4. Discussion  The results of the research suggest that the arrival of ICTs prompted a change in pedagogical approaches of professors of public relations programs in Brazil. Respondents refer to the proactive attitude of students when they develop innovative pedagogical practices, which makes learning more meaningful. In this sense, students become more participative and involved through training that emphasizes reflexive critical thinking and good citizenship, all in line with the challenges of the 21st century. It must be noted that \"[Generation Z] students access information \u2013 not always of good quality \u2013 very quickly and easily and have difficulty paying attention and concentrating on a single activity for long periods of time\" (Quintanilha, 2017: 252, translation). This requires innovative teaching strategies from professors. The respondents\u2019 statements reveal that even those who consider themselves \u201canalog\u201d because they were not literate in the digital world are aware that it is necessary to rethink pedagogical practices to guarantee the attention of young people. Quintanilha (2017) argues that teaching today's students is often considered one of the biggest challenges for educators who adopt traditional teaching methods. Adapting to new pedagogical practices is also one of the greatest difficulties of many educators, because it implies breaking many paradigms. In the specific case of public relations in Brazil, V. Rhoden and J. Rhoden (2017) affirm that there are professors in the field who have difficulties with digital environments and do not always master the new tools; in this sense, they must be trained for the new digital and virtual environment. Aguerrondo has introduced the \"teachability\" concept for the analysis of professor training. According to the author: the classic proposals for teacher training assume original conditions of teachability for future teachers that the processes of mass education have modified [\u2026] neither initial training nor continuous training of teachers has incorporated alternative models of how to teach that can deconstruct the traditional image that has been learned (Aguerrondo, 2010: 3, translation). This assertion suggests that the construction of the new teaching role implies a process of construction, deconstruction, reevaluation, and creation of sorts that resembles a vicious circle acting organically, thus taking into consideration the impact received from the environment and spreading its effects outward. According to the professors interviewed, students perceive a tendency towards change in terms of the performance of their professors, their attempts to teach differently and communicate in other ways. The results indicate that almost all students recognize heterogeneity in their pedagogical relationships with their teachers, especially in regards to communication methods, not necessarily because of digital devices, but because of the digital context in which learning takes place. Ultimately, the aim of professors is to generate some type of change that favors the creating of a new education professional who seeks to apply innovative teaching strategies. Morais and Almeida (2016) affirm that pedagogical practices must be related to different areas of knowledge, perspectives and tasks to ensure coherence between content and student interests. \u201cRecognizing the value of essays and other forms of writing, portfolios, case studies, role-playing and other performances, posters and other public presentations are examples of how the opportunity for debate can be emphasized\u201d (Morais; Almeida, 2016: 143, translation). It is noteworthy that the data collected in the quantitative phase indicates that the teaching methods adopted by a large portion of the professors of public relations programs continue to reflect the traditional teaching model; that is, lectures, discussions, debates and seminars which can be excellent forms of teaching certain topics.  322 On the other hand, the qualitative phase showed a diversification of methods adopted in the classroom, which may have a connection to the context in which the professors find themselves. Methods such as the flipped classroom and dramatization were cited more frequently than lectures, at the same level of games and simulations, followed by concept maps and technical visits, all of which are practices that allow the student to establish connections with content, share experiences with colleagues and dare to create and innovate. In terms of technological supports, the use of messaging and networking apps (WhatsApp and Facebook, respectively) were the most frequently mentioned by professors. In this case, an expansion of the initial use of these tools was observed for the classroom environment, which reveals promising possibilities for testing, discussion groups, news publishing, research, readings, or even maintaining conversations with students who have their attention fixated on social networks and their mobiles, as Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez (2017) points out. In this case, professors must work on current topics of interest to the profession based on content from different subjects, thus seeking interdisciplinary work that avoids knowledge fragmentation and brings students closer to meeting the demands of the workplace. This can be done through the use of software that simulates the practice of management and definition of public relations strategies (A. Grohs and L. Grohs, 2019) or the use of films and series to analyze public opinions, attitudes and behaviors in the face of ethical dilemmas and the impact on organizations (Silva and Henriques, 2018). Likewise, according to the \"From class to account\" program, it is possible to stimulate the development of projects in collaboration with other educational or professional institutions. This places value on teamwork and providing experiences in intercultural environments through the mediation of digital platforms, thus demonstrating that there are no barriers to innovation in the teaching-learning process. Regarding infrastructure (libraries, equipped classrooms, computers, etc.), many professors commented on the availability of resources. However, future studies would be necessary to determine if the qualification of professors and technicians influences the use of these tools. This is because, considering the great advances in technology, it is necessary to adapt to this constantly changing reality. The field of education is one of the most severely affected, and it must move forward and introduce emerging learning practices to get as close as possible to the realities experienced by students. Thus, professors must overcome the \"tendency to transmit \u2018fixed values\u2019 of information and invest in methods that equip students with the ability to formulate well-founded knowledge\" (Lima, 1997: 3, translation). However, even if students are the protagonists of their learning, the professor will continue to act as a motivating agent so that students can discover links between concepts and, therefore, build new schemes and knowledge. Entry into the environment of digital technologies brings consequences to the learning process that \u201chas become increasingly distanced from the environment known by many professors in their training and experience. Specific competencies are required to face these changes\u201d (Prata-Linhares, Pimenta and Gon\u00e7allo, 2017: 619, translation). Therefore, it is essential that HEIs and professors are aware that the profile of the student has changed over the years and, therefore, it is necessary to adapt to new media and contexts. The current challenge for professors is to awaken in students the motivation to acquire new knowledge throughout life, based on the perspective of continuing education that promotes personal and professional development, which is essential in public relations. This vision is one of the findings of the study, which reveals that the adoption of active methods and digital tools by professors facilitates student learning. Interviews revealed that students happen to play a more active role, breaking down the stigma of being a mere receiver of content. Thus, it is essential that the professor consider the ecology of digital learning. This presupposes a hybrid education that weaves in face-to-face education that fosters emotions and interpersonal relationships with technological platforms to support students in the search for autonomy and respect for personal interests.  5. Conclusions Research shows that, in recent years, there has been a relative advancement in terms of digital technology that has impacted teaching-learning methodologies in all areas of knowledge. In the specific case of public relations programs in Brazil, the study revealed that professors are adapting their in-class methodologies and practices in response to the \u201cdigital\u201d students of the 21st century, who find support in technology to achieve knowledge.  323 The findings of the study conducted between 2016 and 2018 demonstrate that public relations programs have been renewing and updating their teaching-learning methods to keep up with daily advances in the workplace. Therefore, young communicators recently graduated from HEIs need competencies that meet business and technology demands. Within organizations, these competencies make it possible for appropriate learning outcomes to be applied in a work context. Rather than being limited to cognitive elements, these competencies also involve functional aspects including technical, interpersonal and attitudinal skills, such as positioning in the face of ethical dilemmas. The professional practice of public relations is based on managing relationships. This premise should serve as a starting point for innovative teaching-learning processes such as the inclusion of dramatizations and/or role plays that simulate problems of everyday life, management of social networks created with the purpose of facing challenges in times of crisis, the creation of necessary digital channels for the promotion of events coordinated by students. These recommendations promote the integration of theory and practice and can be expanded by promoting interdisciplinary projects mediated with the use of technologies, depending on the content, situations and learning objectives to be achieved, in accordance with the vocation of the pedagogical project of the course of each HEI. There is consensus on the determining role that students play in the learning process as protagonists of their own story through different learning experiences facilitated by the professors with whom they interact. For this reason, valuing student autonomy, the development of their skills and their training processes are principles that should guide HEIs in the new century. This aforementioned role is essential in the day to day activities of communications professionals, since they will face power conflicts and ethical dilemmas that will demand their \"academic knowledge\" and analytical capacity to make appropriate decisions for both for society and the organization. The approach that places the individual as the builder of his or her own story and that places the professor as mediator of the teaching-learning process requires a cultural change in traditional pedagogical thinking. This change must be supported by teacher training that is consistent with reality. Among the most important findings is the incorporation of ICTs as an educational support that depends on a contemporary pedagogical notion aligned with institutional values. The recent mobilization of Brazilian HEIs in the pedagogical redevelopment of public relations programs, based on mandatory curricular guidelines that require greater coordination between theory, practice and technology management, may have instigated other forms of teaching. It is true that the effects of the implementation may take time to show, since most are in the process of adaptation. It is imperative that there be new research to continue identifying teaching practices and pedagogical notion adopted in public relations programs in the country. Finally, the results obtained from the present study offer an opportunity for new studies to be developed, mainly to assess the impact of technology on the learning process of students in the digital age, which poses a challenge for professors, HEIs and the public relations profession. In addition, it demonstrates the efforts of academia to cross over to the working world to equip communications professionals with techniques, strategies, and training so they become citizens concerned about the quality of life of society and not only the economic interests of organizations.  6.

Reviewers' selection is conducted according to the affinity, recognition and research background criteria on the topics of the paper to be reviewed. Female and male doctors are always selected. Sometimes, other highly recognised professionals in the field were involved. The Mediterranean Journal of Communication holds several types of database of different experts in the field. It is a requirement that the reviewer does not belong to the same institution as the author of the article to be reviewed. In addition, an attempt is made to avoid any conflict of interest.   The reviewers' board duties are to ensure the quality of manuscripts to be published in the journal and explain properly the evaluation decisions of the article. The editorial board conducts a tracking process of every reviewer establishing a quality process in the manuscripts review to ensure compliance with deadlines, maintenance of anonymity, explanation of the decisions and information for the author. Collaborations are certified annually after the review process. We express our gratitude to the collaborating reviewers for their rigorous and committed work. We highlight their didactical support concerning amendments to texts to be published in the journal. Their contributions are always valuable and highly appreciated by the authors. Some of them have collaborated in reviewing more than one text.   The reviewers of the current issue are presented as follows:   Dra. Natalia Abu\u00edn-Vences. Universidad Complutense de Madrid.
