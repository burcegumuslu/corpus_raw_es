Nintendo also said its DS handheld game player likely posted record sales in the United States (U.S.) in 2009, and total sales of the portable machine have reached 40 million units in Europe, becoming the top-selling video game hardware ever in the region.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s now safe to say the Wii has recovered from slowdown,\u201d Nintendo President Satoru Iwata told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s prudent to use words like revival and recovery lightly before making absolutely certain we can maintain this momentum. So, I steer clear of such words today,\u201d he said.\nDriven by white hot demand for the Wii and DS, Nintendo shares had jumped more than fivehold in two years to October 2007 to become Japan\u2019s third-most valuable company in terms of market capitalisation.\nSince then, however, the stock has lost 68 percent as sales of its hardware and game titles showed signs of slowing down.\nFor Nintendo's quarterly results in recent years and historical share price, click:\n[here](http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/0110/JP_NTDO0110.gif)\nNintendo sold more than 3 million units of the Wii in the U.S. in December 2009, up sharply from 2.14 million units a year earlier, thanks to a series of strong new game titles such as \u201cNew Super Mario Bros. Wii\u201d action game, and a hardware price cut, Iwata said.\nNintendo cut the price of the Wii, which outsells Sony Corp's\n[6758.T](/companies/6758.T) PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Corp's [MSFT.O](/companies/MSFT.O) Xbox 360, by 20 percent in the second half of last year in an effort to breathe vigour back into console sales.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of factors. Towards December, our software lineup got stronger. Also, the price cut certainly helped, although it is not the sole factor,\u201d Iwata said.\nNintendo launched \u201cNew Super Mario Bros. Wii\u201d in November in the U.S., and U.S. sales came to about 4 million units by the end of the year, he said.\nOn the handheld side, Nintendo\u2019s DS sales in the U.S. likely exceeded 10 million units in 2009, setting a record for annual game hardware sales in the country, Iwata said.\n\u201cThe DS was launched back in 2004, and sales of that machine hit a record in 2009 in the United States. That is totally different from the conventional sales pattern, in which game gear sales peak in the third year and take a downturn thereafter,\u201d he said.\nBefore Iwata's comments, shares in Nintendo closed up 1.4 percent at 22,930 yen, outperforming the Nikkei average\n[.N225](/quote/.N225), which rose 0.3 percent.\n(Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka, editing by Will Waterman, Rupert Winchester and Sharon Lindores)\n((kiyoshi.takenaka@thomsonreuters.com; +81 3 6441 1810; Reuters Messaging: kiyoshi.takenaka.reuters.com@reuters.net))\n((If you have a query or comment on this story, send an email to news.feedback.asia@thomsonreuters.com)) Keywords: NINTENDO/\nC Reuters 2010.
