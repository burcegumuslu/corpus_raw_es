He added 161 with wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose, who made 67, for the sixth wicket to revive England after they slumped from 84 for two to 86 for five in the space of 13 balls.\nEngland need only to avoid defeat to claim a series victory after drawing at Lord\u2019s and winning the second test at Old Trafford.\nPietersen, 27, in his 39th test, reached his century after tea with a firm drive through cover for four off Chris Martin. He celebrated animatedly by jumping in the air and pumping his fist and was warmly applauded by his former home crowd.\nEngland\u2019s afternoon slump began when Andrew Strauss fell six balls after lunch when he abandoned the patient approach he had employed in the morning by chasing a wide Kyle Mills ball to give Ross Taylor a head high catch at first slip for 37.\nIan Bell played across a straight ball and was lbw for nought to Iain O\u2019Brien after lasting just three balls. His fellow middle-order colleague Paul Collingwood, also under pressure after some mediocre recent form, lasted four balls for no runs, edging Mills to Taylor at slip.\nPietersen\u2019s confidence grew and his range of stroke-play became more expansive the longer he was in. An off-driven four, a pulled boundary and a flick through mid-on for another boundary, all off paceman Martin, demonstrated this in consecutive overs shortly before tea.\nHe eventually perished when O\u2019Brien rushed him with the third over of the new ball as his half-hearted push gave New Zealand wicketkeeper Gareth Hopkins his first catch on debut. Regular keeper Brendon McCullum is playing solely as a batsman because of a back injury.\nAmbrose, who scored a century against New Zealand in his second test in March, ably supported Pieteresen, though the Black Caps may have fed his favoured square cut too often with short and wide deliveries.\nO\u2019Brien, who was expected to be left out for teenager Tim Southee before the match, returned test best figures of four for 61 from 20 overs at stumps.\nAlastair Cook, bowled off his inside edge by Mills for six, and Michael Vaughan, who was bowled for 16 after missing a straight O\u2019Brien delivery, fell before lunch.\nStuart Broad was 15 not out with James Anderson, who was remarkably sent in as night-watchman to protect number nine batman Ryan Sidebottom, on one.\nediting by Justin Palmer\nOur Standards:\n[The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)", "language": null, "image": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20080605&t=2&i=4659562&r=2008-06-05T174336Z_01_L03494421_RTRUKOP_0_PICTURE0&w=800", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/global-gateway.html", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/login.html", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216467423-Contact-Reuters", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us", "https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/sportsNews", "https://www.reuters.com/journalists/richard-sydenham", "https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-cricket-zealand-quotes/pietersen-delighted-by-his-century-under-pressure-idUKL0527085720080605", "https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-cricket-zealand-quotes/pietersen-delighted-by-his-century-under-pressure-idUKL0527085720080605", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "//www.reuters.com/tools/mobile", "//newslink.reuters.com/join/subscribe", "//sales.reuters.com/en/ ", "//www.reuters.com/advertising-guidelines", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#cookies", "//www.reuters.com/terms-of-use", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "javascript:window.OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();", "https://www.reuters.com/info/disclaimer", "https://thomsonreuters.com/copyright/"]}
