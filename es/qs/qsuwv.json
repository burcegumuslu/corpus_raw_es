Deficient regulation is one of the \nleading causes of this crisis.1 The policy and \nlegal framework in place is insufficient to tackle \nissues such as water use for different purposes, \nexploitation of natural springs, and exposure of \nnatural water sources to contamination from \nagricultural and industrial activity, all of which \nbear critical ramifications for sustainability of \nlife in the country.10\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERIt stands that deficient legislation translates \ninto deficient resource management, which has \nopened the door for inefficiency, abuse, and \nundeniable inequality in terms of access to safe \nwater. This inequality especially affects people \nliving in poverty and socially and economically \nvulnerable groups, including women. The \ncountry has a scattered series of norms that fail \nto cover the full spectrum of conditions needed \nto ensure justice and equity in access to the \nhuman right to water for all Salvadorans.2\nFour out of every ten people in the rural areas of \nEl Salvador do not have uninterrupted access to \nwater, despite the presence of sufficient water \nsupplies to meet the domestic demand.4 This \nsupply notwithstanding, it is also important \nto recognize that the amount of available \nwater per person in the country is indeed low. \nParadoxically, despite having average yearly \nrainfall above the global average,5 El Salvador \nhas one of the lowest levels of water availability \nper inhabitant in Central America and the \nCaribbean.6 According to information published \nby the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) \nand the Economic Commission for Latin America \nand the Caribbean (ECLAC) in 2018, El Salvador \ncame in near the bottom in a ranking of 27 \ncountries of Latin America and the Caribbean in \nterms of annual water availability per inhabitant \n(22nd place)7.\nNatural freshwater sources such as aquifers \nand rivers have been losing their capacity as \nreservoirs. Strategic aquifers have lost from 0.5 \nto 1 meter of flow rate per year. Of the 360 most \nimportant rivers, all except for one have seen \ntheir flow rate drop by 30% to 70%8. In an even \nmore critical shift, rivers in the Eastern region of \nthe country shrank by up to 90% from May 2018 \nto March 2019.9\nThe current and future availability of this \nessential resource for life is compromised by \nlosses and leaks in the national supply system, \nimpacts from climate change, and uncontrolled \nhuman activity. Examples of this activity \ninclude overuse of water sources by actors \nfrom different economic sectors, and soil \ndegradation due to deforestation and the use of chemicals in different production activities. \nAs a result, the land has progressively lost the \nwater filtration and catchment capacity needed \nto ensure reserves.\nSpecialists refer to water stress in the case of \nEl Salvador, which carries the risk of deepening \nthe preexisting gaps in water access. The \nlack of effective regulation on water use and \nextraction favors economic actors by default, \nto the detriment of the water rights of people \nliving in rural areas or impoverished urban \nzones. The situation for schools in the country \nis a reflection of this inequality\n  \u201c(...) According to 2014 data from the Ministry \nof Education, there were over 1,100 schools \nwithout plumbing installed for drinking water. \nThis means that over 10% of the schools did \nnot have running water and had to resort to \nother sources such as rainwater collection. I \nvisited a school in a rural area where running \nwater is not provided by the State. The \nPrincipal informed me that they have to raise \nmoney to ensure access to water for the \nstudents. In the dry season, the school has \nhad to resort to buying water at up to $75 per \ntank truck (10,000 liters)... The principal broke \ndown during my visit and said: \u2018It broke my \nheart to see the ANDA tank trucks serve the \ninhabitants of a fancy residential area next \ndoor, when I had just come from asking for \ntheir help to meet the needs of my students\u2019\u201d \n(Special Rapporteur, 2016).1011\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERThe Water Forum [ Foro del Agua ]11 reports that an area of 36,400 hectares of sugarcane plantation in \nthe coastal region of the country can consume up to 205 million cubic meters of water for irrigation \n(5,632 liters of water per hectare) from the January to May season.12 Given the water-intensive \nproduction process for this crop, large plantations often use and overuse underground and surface \nwaters, leaving the local communities and settlements with insufficient water for consumption. \nA 2016 report by the Salvadoran Ecological Unit [ Unidad Ecol\u00f3gica Salvadore\u00f1a , UNES]13 estimates \nthat approximately 81% of the water extracted from the lower portion of the R\u00edo Paz river (coastal \nzone) goes to irrigating sugarcane plantations in the area, while only 8% is left for consumption and \nhousehold use in the local communities, and 11% goes to watering agricultural plots, pasture for \nlivestock, banana trees and garden plots, and basic staple grains.14\nThe UNES report also found that widespread sugarcane production is causing drought, especially \nin the coastal areas of El Salvador, drying up the traditional wells that communities depend on for \ntheir survival. These communities find themselves forced to consume contaminated water due to salt \ninfiltration into the aquifers, further deteriorating subsistence agriculture in the area. For example, \nlocal communities have noted and denounced that the R\u00edo Caliente river in the municipality of \nTecoluca, in the department of San Vicente, is running dry due to the excessive extraction of water to \nirrigate the sugarcane fields for the Jiboa sugar mill.15 16 In the community of San Carlos Lempa (also in \nthe municipality of Tecoluca), inhabitants also report negative impacts on water availability, partly as \na result of intensive sugarcane production in the area.17\nWater has been extracted from underground sources, even during severe drought years. These \npractices have led to record sugarcane exports, even while rural communities face shortages. 2015 \nwas a drought year18, for example, and also a record year for sugarcane exportation.19 \nDeforestation is another factor threatening water availability.20 Cutting of relatively old-growth \ntrees to clear commercial space has led to the destruction of a primary forest in the Cerro El \u00c1guila \nhighlands in Juay\u00faa, a municipality in the department of Sonsonate.21 Communities in the area report \nthat five manzanas (approximately 3.5 hectares) have been destroyed this way.22 This development \ncould affect the water catchment area for the Sunsunap\u00e1n River given the important role of forests in \nthis regard.23 Deforestation thus puts the human right to water at risk for over 264,000 inhabitants in \nthe area and threatens the biodiversity of important water ecosystems.24Box 1. Overexploitation of aquifers and deforestation: Threats to water availability\n12\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWEREl Salvador also faces serious problems in \nterms of water quality.26  The Ministry of the \nEnvironment and Natural Resources (MARN) \nhas noted that the \u201cproblem of surface \nwater contamination is linked to regional \ndevelopment, urban settlements, industry, \nand agricultural activities that, combined with \nthe lack of wastewater treatment systems,27 \npoor basic sanitation, and low environmental \neducation for the population, put the quality of \nsurface waters at serious risk\u201d.28\nOver 90% of surface waters in the country are \ncontaminated by toxic waste and industrial \nheavy metals, poisonous chemicals from \nagricultural runoff, and untreated sewage.29 \nDue to this contamination, less than 12% of \nthe rivers of the country can be used for the \nactivities of human consumption, irrigation, \naquaculture or recreation.30 Relatedly, the \ncountry also faces serious problems for water \npotability. For example, the government had to \nlaunch an emergency plan in January 2020 due \nto potable water contamination and shortages \nin the San Salvador Metropolitan Area.31\nNearly 13 years have gone by since the Water \nForum presented the first public proposal for \nwater legislation in the country in 2006. By the \ntime of this publication, over four proposed \nbills  have been presented to the Legislative \nAssembly32 but none of them have been passed. \nAdditionally, despite the demands of many civil \nsociety organizations, the legislative branch \nhas not been able to come to the necessary \nconsensus to explicitly recognize the human \nright to water in the national Constitution.\n \nIn recent years, the possibility of approving water \nlegislation with only public entities in charge  \nhas  faced strong resistance from stakeholders \nwith economic interests. Many of these private \nactors are grouped in industry associations that wield important national influence, such as the \nNational Private Enterprise Association (ANEP).33\nOne key moment that highlighted these \nconflicting interests was the submission of \nthe Comprehensive Water Law [ Ley Integral del \nAgua , or LIA by its Spanish abbreviation] in 2017. \nThis bill was drafted by a \u201ccommittee of water \nexperts\u201d (a group with private sector linkages)34 \nand submitted to the Legislative Assembly by \na group of legislators from right-wing parties: \nThe National Republican Alliance [ Alianza \nRepublicana Nacionalista , ARENA], the National \nCoalition Party [ Partido de Concertaci\u00f3n \nNacional , PCN], Great Alliance for National Unity \n[Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional , GANA], and \nthe Christian Democrat Party [ Partido Dem\u00f3crata \nCristiano , PDC]. This proposal stands apart in \nseveral ways from other bills that had gained a \nsemblance of consensus from different political \nparties in the Legislative Assembly and, unlike \nthe LIA, enjoyed explicit and broad support from \ndifferent sectors of civil society.\nEverything seems to indicate that the \nconcentration of economic power held by \nthe elites with the greatest stake in water \ngovernance (sugarcane producers, the \nreal estate industry and bottled beverage \ncompanies), their close ties with the political \nclass in the country, and the lack of mechanisms \nto limit their power to influence public policy \ndecisions could be the explanation as to why it \nhas been impossible for over a decade for the \ncountry to pass such essential legislation for \npeople\u2019s lives.The Cerro El \u00c1guila area is not only one of the largest water reserves in the country; it is also located \nin the Apaneca-Ilamatepec Biosphere Reserve, certified as such by the United Nations Educational, \nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2007.25\nSource: Developed internally from a number of sources.13\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERSECTION 2\n \nTHE \nINEQUALITY \nBEHIND\nTHE WATER \nCRISISIn the rural area, 36% of the population \nhas limited or no access to running water, \ncompared to 13% of the population in urban \nareas who have no or irregular running \nwater.35 Access to water sources and \nhousehold running water connections also \nrise in correlation with household income. For \nexample, 37% of the poorest households36 \nhave no or limited access to water. \n14\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWER\nBox 2. A golf course consumes 1.728 million liters of water per day.Only 5% of the poorest households are \nconnected to the public running water \nsystem, compared to 58% of the wealthiest \nhouseholds37 with these services.38 These and \nother inequalities are at the root of frequent \ndemonstrations and road blockages protesting \nthe lack of water services, shortages, and/\nor long-term water rationing in rural and poor \nurban areas. Most of the wealthier residential \ndevelopments and shopping centers have \nuninterrupted access to water.39, 40\n People living in rural areas or the poorest \nhouseholds often may go for days without water \nservices or with an insufficient supply that they \nstore in barrels or other containers (creating \na potential breeding ground for transmission \nvectors for disease or other contaminants). Other \nfamilies are forced to walk several kilometers to \nfind water, drink water from a well or other very \ncontaminated natural source, pay 10% to 15% of \ntheir income to procure water, or even put their \nlives at risk to find water, all while other economic \nsectors are paying relatively little for water.42\nWhile the El Encanto golf course is watered with potable water to keep it green year-round, 75% of \nthe population surrounding the club does not have water to drink. This is the reality for water access \nin the municipality of San Jos\u00e9 Villanueva in the department of La Libertad, where potable water \nshortages from 2010 to 2015 have left over 10,000 people to guarantee by themselves this human \nright.43\nIf there is no rainfall, inhabitants from these communities walk up to 1.5 kilometers down dirt paths \nto reach the nearest river. River contamination in the area is also part of the daily struggle to procure \nwater. If families choose not to walk long distances, they must pay $5.00 (US) for someone to haul \na couple of barrels for the household to use. Considering that the minimum wage in the agricultural \nsector in El Salvador is $203.00 per month,44 one can get an idea of the proportion of household \nexpenditures that water procurement represents for a rural family living in poverty.\nAccording to some estimates, El Encanto uses 20 liters of water per second to meet the demands of \nwatering an 18-hole golf course, which adds up to 1.728 million liters of water per day.45 At the same \ntime, at least three municipalities in the department of La Libertad face severe water shortages.15\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWER\nSource: Adapted from F. Pe\u00f1a (2015).46The Salvadoran state has failed to keep its promise to lay pipes, install connections, drill wells, and \nconnect faucets to supply safe water for the households in the most affected municipalities of the \ndepartment. Even in households that do have running water connections, people often go up to 20 \ndays at a time without service, despite paying a monthly service fee.\nFaced with this absence of the State and excess business activity, people turn to water tank trucks \nto procure drinking water, and in the rainy season they collect rainwater for use in household tasks, \nincluding personal hygiene.16\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERThe crisis of water access and quality crisis \nare larger still when analyzed through the lens \nof the effect and impact on women\u2019s lives. \nWomen take on the majority of household \nlabor and unpaid care work. Salvadoran women \nspend an average of 19 hours more per week \nthan men performing household tasks.47 This \ngap is greater still in the rural areas, where the \ndifference climbs to 24 hours per week.48 \nThe link between access to quality water and \ngender justice is clear. Water is necessary for \ncleaning, food preparation, care for children \nand older adults or dependents, and other \nactivities that women perform to a greater \nextent. These factors continue to limit their \neconomic autonomy, personal empowerment, \nand political participation.\nBox 3.  The water crisis is female.17\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERIn 2015, a number of agencies in the country warned that increased extraction from the Nejapa \naquifer by the EMBOSALVA S.A. company (currently Industrias La Constancia, ILC, part of Anheuser-\nBusch InBev, (AB InBev), the main bottler of Coca-Cola in El Salvador), could leave over 30,000 \nresidents of the municipality of Nejapa and 30% of the inhabitants of the department of San \nSalvador without access to water.49 Similarly, a report by the organization Alianza por la Solidaridad \nindicated that an eventual approval of the bottling plant\u2019s most recent request for expansion \nwould exhaust the aquifer in a span of just 27 years.50, 51 The stark inequality in the distribution of \ncare tasks between men and women means that women will be the most affected as they attempt \nto perform the water-intensive tasks.\nAs part of a research study entitled \u201cForeign investment in a bottling plant in El Salvador, the Nejapa \ncase\u201d, focus groups were formed with local community leaders to help understand the impact of the \nbottling company on people\u2019s lives. In the interviews, participants referenced that there are many \nsingle mothers in the municipality affected by the lack of water and that, when there were children \nin the home, the situation was much worse. Women expressed the deepest concern about the water \nsituation in Nejapa, as they had first-hand knowledge of the daily difficulties that are caused by a \ncontinued lack of water.53 The study indicates a direct link between water shortages and the social \ninequalities between genders. 54\nWhen broader groups of community representatives were interviewed, a large number of women \nparticipated and described all of the negative impacts that the plant expansion could bring. \nNonetheless, when a focus group was formed with respondents from entities that supported the \nbottling plant (such as the inter-community board55), no women participated in the group, only men \ndid. The study found that the bottling plant has undertaken a strategy to build alliances and direct \ncontacts with certain community stakeholders with a greater proclivity to support plant expansion, \nleaving opposing stakeholders - the majority of whom are women - out of the alliances.\nAs has been the case in many other areas, women in Nejapa have taken a leadership role in water \npreservation for human consumption (water for life), and they have been able to mobilize the rest of \nthe population on many occasions. This is an important dynamic to highlight because even though \nwomen carry the heaviest burden of household tasks for which water is essential, they are not \nusually taken into consideration in the decision-making spaces for control over this vital resource.56\nAlthough the bottling company reports having undertaken a series of activities to benefit the \ninhabitants of Nejapa, the Municipal Council, social organizations, and the population interviewed for \nthe aforementioned study all report that the company\u2019s actions in this realm have been quite limited.57\nSource: Developed internally from a number of sources. 18\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWER\nSection 3.\n \nWATER AND \nTHE FIGHT \nTO REDUCE \nINEQUALITY: \nCONTEXT, \nACTORS, AND \nTHE INTERESTS \nAT STAKEBackground \nThe problem of water and water-related conflict \nin El Salvador is deeply-rooted, and it is a \nproblem that has grown more complex since \nthe middle of the 20th century to the present \nday.58 Since its constitution as an independent \nrepublic, El Salvador has \u201cmoved through \nthree basic economic models: agricultural \nexportation, industrialization to substitute \nimportations, and export promotion\u201d (Artiga, \n2018).59 Over the past three decades, this last \nmodel has been based on the \u201capplication of \neconomic liberalization policies and measures, \nopen trade, privatization, deregulation, and the \nreduction of state intervention\u201d (Artiga, 2018).60 \nWater has been a powerful strategic resource in \neach of these models.61 \n19\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERNonetheless, it was only in 1999, as part of \nthe growing trade liberalization process of the \nSalvadoran economy, that a first proposal to \nregulate this field was produced. Ra\u00fal Artiga \n(2018) interprets the initiative as a need for the \nprivate/productive sector to ensure access to \nwater in the context of the growing presence \nof foreign capital in the country. Access and \navailability faced even steeper challenges \nwith the over-extraction and contamination of \nnatural aquifers as a result of the production \nmodels that flourished under weak institutional \ncontrols.62\nIn 1999, after a series of closed-door negotiations \nwith the government administration at that time, \nthe private sector and a number of international \norganizations drafted and proposed a General \nWater Law with \u201can entirely economics-based \nperspective to ensure water quantity and water \nquality for different uses, especially production, \nin which resource regulation would depend on \nthe market (the water rights market)\u201d (Artiga, \n2018).63, 64 This first version of the law never \nsaw the light of day due to an adverse context: \n\u201cthe political scenario of polarization and social \ntensions generated by the attempt to privatize \nthe healthcare system shelved the initiative\u201d.65\nIn the El\u00edas Antonio Saca administration from \n2004 to 2009 (ARENA), a new proposal was \ndrafted. Nonetheless, Artiga reports that this \nprocess was \u201climited to the internal workings of the government, conducted with much secrecy, \nand prioritizing the support and blessing of the \nproductive sector for the proposed legislation, \nwhich was not achieved\u201d.66\nThe demand for a Water Law\nConsidering only the proposed laws that have \nbeen submitted for consideration and public \ndebate in the Legislative Committee on the \nEnvironment and Climate Change (CMCC)67, four \nbasic proposals can be identified, introduced \nfrom 2006 to 2020,68 and three main stages of \nthe discussion process. The first such stage \nran from 2012 to 2015, the second from 2015 to \n2018, and the latest lasted from 2018 to 2020 \n(see Figure 1).\nThe initial debate began in 2006, when a first \nproposal was introduced in the Legislative \nAssembly. This Water Law (LA by its Spanish \nacronym) was introduced by C\u00e1ritas and UNES,69 \nrepresenting the Water Forum. The Forum \nworked over the course of one year to \nhold a consultation process with different \ncommunities to design the legislation.70 The \nproposal was updated from 2011 to 2013 to \ninclude the human right to water, among other \ncomponents, which was explicitly recognized \nby the United Nations in 2010.\nFigure 1. Water Law proposals introduced in the Legislative Assembly\nSource: Developed internally based on remarks by FUNDE71 to the Legislative Assembly in March 2019.\n20\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWEROn March 22, 2012, in honor of World Water \nDay and based on the proposal from the Water \nForum, the Ministry of the Environment and \nNatural Resources (MARN) submitted the G eneral \nWater Law  (LGA by its Spanish abbreviation), \nwhich eventually earned the support of the \nForum. In 2013, another proposal called the \nComprehensive Water Management Law  (LGIA \nby its Spanish abbreviation) was submitted \nby the private sector (El Cacao Irrigators \nAssociation)72, with advisory support from the \nSalvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social \nDevelopment (FUSADES).73, 74\nIn June 2017, a group with private sector ties \ncalling itself the \u201cWater Experts Committee\u201d \nsubmitted a new proposal entitled the \nComprehensive Water Law  (LIA by its Spanish \nabbreviation), with support from the block of right-wing political parties: ARENA, GANA, PCN, \nand PDC. Two months later, the \u201cJos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n \nCa\u00f1as\u201d Central American University (UCA) \npublished a proposal for a water governing \ninstitution, emphasizing which sectors should \nbe responsible for making the regulatory \ndecisions.\nIt is worth noting that in 2014 and 2015, MARN, \nthe Ministry of the Economy (MINEC), and ANEP \ncarried out dialogues in the country on the \nregulations of water assets. These discussions \nproduced a technical document that was \nnever submitted to the Legislative Assembly.75 \nAccording to a MARN representative, this \nproposal served as the basis for the LIA, but \nthe private sector modified the content before \nsubmitting it to the legislature.76\nFigure 2. Discussion on the Water Law in the Legislative Assembly from 2012 to 2021\nSource: Developed internally based on remarks by FUNDE to the Legislative Assembly in March 2019.\n21\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWEROver the three periods of debate in the Legislative \nAssembly, most of the progress toward possible \nwater legislation came from 2012 to 2015. The \nCMCC at that time was chaired by Francis Zablah, \na legislator from the GANA party. This stage \nalso coincides with the final three years of the \nMauricio Funes administration in the executive \nbranch (from June 1, 2009 to June 1, 2014) under \nthe Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front \n(FMLN).77 Funes was the first president elected \nfrom a left-wing party in El Salvador.\nWorking off of the MARN proposal from 2012, \nthe Legislative Assembly undertook a broad \nconsultation process.  Hundreds of organizations \nsubmitted correspondence to have their views \nincluded in the discussions underway around \nthe proposed bill.78 It is important to add that \nover 100,000 signatures were gathered in the \ncourse of this consultation process to support \nthe recognition and development of the human \nright to water in the national legal framework.79 \nThe dynamic social movement of the time and \nthe openness of the Legislative Assembly \nsucceeded in advancing a proposed water \nlegislation built on consensus between MARN \nand different social organizations and actors.80\nThe Legislative Assembly reached agreements \non 92 of the approximately 200 articles in the \nproposed LGA promoted by MARN, and supported \nby the Water Forum and a broad and significant \nsector of the citizens and government of the \ntime. Despite this progress, the Assembly \nfailed to come to agreement on critical aspects \nsuch as the institutional structure for water \nmanagement. The proposal to recognize the \nhuman right to water in the Constitution of the \nRepublic also stagnated.\nThe discussion of the MARN LGA continued in \nthe next legislative session from 2015 to 2018, \nbut less progress was made compared to the \nprevious period. The Chairman of the CMCC at \nthat time was FMLN legislator Guillermo Mata \nBennet. The President of El Salvador was Salvador \nS\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n, from the same party. According \nto FUNDE, the most important achievement in \nthis period was the passage of a proposal to \ncreate an autonomous agency that would be \nin charge of water stewardship.81 This would turn out to be a central point in the debate, as \nexplained below.\nSince 2017, the political debate to approve a \npertinent water law has stopped, mainly due to \nthe disruptive effect of the right-wing parties \nintroducing the LIA, which broke the agreements \nreached up to 2015, and marked the start of the \nrecent, strong conflict in the country around \npossible water legislation. In addition, for a \nlarge part of 2018, the run-up to the presidential \nelections that would be held on February 3, 2019, \nserved as an excuse to justify the new paralysis \nin the legislative process.\nIn May 2018, the new members of the CMCC \nfor the 2018-2021 legislative session,82 \nchaired by Martha Evelyn Batres from the \nARENA party, decided to restart the discussion \nprocess entirely. The 92 articles that had been \nconstructed previously were discarded, and \nthe LIA (not the LGA that had been introduced \nby MARN) was used as the framework for the \nnew debate. According to FUNDE, from 2018 \nto the present, no progress has been made \non substantive aspects on institutional \narrangements in the law.\nSince 2017, the main points of disagreement \nhave been the different alternatives for the \nexisting institutional framework: the proposals \nfrom the LGA, LIA, and the UCA proposal. In fact, \nthe Minister of the Environment at the time, Lina \nPohl, published an article stating that 85% of the \nproposal introduced by the private sector in 2017 \nwas fairly similar to the text produced by the \ndiscussions and debates with ANEP in 2014 and \n2015 (that is, in large part aligned with the MARN \nproposal), and the problem was the remaining \n15% that was holding up the process.83\nAlong these lines, the main aspect driving \nconflict in the debate was the composition of \nthe regulatory body. In the initial version, the LIA \nproposed a five-person board of directors: two \nrepresentatives designated by the Corporation \nof Municipal Governments of El Salvador \n(COMURES)84, two by ANEP, and one person \nappointed by the President of the Republic. In this \nregard, the LIA clearly prioritized private-sector \nrepresentation on this body. This composition 22\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERis at the core of the conflict, pitting opposing \nvisions for the structure of the governing body \nand who should have a seat at the table. In \nthe balance was who would have the power \nto decide over water management, national \nwater policy, national and local plans, \nregulations, permits, and rates for water \nuse, among other issues. The elites who use \nwater as part of their economic activities \nthus had more than a passing interest in \nensuring a voice in decision-making within \nthe institutional structure, as seen in the \nproposals submitted by these sectors.\nIn 2018, the CMCC decision to restart \ndiscussions based only on the private sector \nproposal sparked a number of large-scale \nmarches demanding a general water law \nwith a strong public institution, and the \nrecognition of the human right to water in the \nConstitution.85, 86  In the second half of 2018, \na national movement coalesced against what \nwas seen as an attempt to privatize water \nby taking control of the regulatory body.87 \nAfter intense citizen protest, the Legislative \nAssembly held a series of hearings to give \nvoice to the positions from the different \nsocial sectors. However, the hearings were \nunsuccessful in reducing the conflict.88 Thus, \nbetween a conflict with no apparent solution \nand the electoral context, the discussion on \na legal framework for comprehensive water \nmanagement has remained in limbo.89\nOpposing visions: The LGA, LIA, and regulatory \nbody proposed by the UCA   \n \nAs for the general content of the laws, and \nas inferred in the previous paragraphs, the \ncurrent confrontation is between the latest \nversion of the LGA proposed by MARN, and \nthe LIA, supported by the private sector \nand proposed by ARENA, GANA, PCN, and \nPDC. In terms of the specific question of the \ninstitutional structure, there are currently two positions staked out in the conflict: the \nUCA proposal (backed by MARN and different \nsocial stakeholders and organizations), \nand the private sector position (updating \nthe initial 2017 proposal by increasing the \nrepresentatives designated by the president \nof the republic from 1 to 3 appointees).90\nFigure 3. Governing body proposals, \nupdated in 2018\nSource: Developed internally based on remarks by \nFUNDE to the Legislative Assembly in March 2019.\n23\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERTable 1. Opposing visions on the General Water Law (LGA) and the Comprehensive Water Law (LIA)\nSources: Developed internally based on testimony by the following institutions at the Legislative Assembly: \nUniversity of El Salvador (UES), Salvadoran Chamber of the Construction Industry (CASALCO), Movement of Victims \nand Communities Affected by Climate Change and Corporations (MOVIAC), Ombudsman for the Defense of Human \nRights (PDDH), ANEP, and opinions shared in interviews conducted for this research project.The main points in dispute are in regard to the \nnature of the governing body for water resources \n(with a majority public stake in the UCA proposal, \nand with a majority representation from the \nprivate sector in the LIA, including two members \nappointed by ANEP), as well as the established  \nparticipation mechanisms considered in the law. There are also differences between the \nLGA and LIA on other specific issues such as the \npermits to exploit water sources (setting time \nlimits and volumes), the system of penalties \nin cases of non-compliance, rates for water \nextraction and discharge, and leadership in \npotable water and sanitation bodies.91\nANEP critiques of the LGAUniversity and social organization critiques of \nthe LIA\n\u2022 The institutional structure proposed by \nthe LGA is discretionary and arbitrary.92\n\u2022 Article 120 of the LGA grants discretionary \nand arbitrary powers to MARN that would \nallow it, under the guise of \u201cprotecting\u201d \nwater, to tacitly \u201cexpropriate\u201d specific \nproperties,93 creating rules to \u201cconfiscate \nprivate property\u201d.\n\u2022 Article 87 of the LGA favors \n\u201cadministrative silence\u201d interpreted as a \nnegative response.94\n\u2022 Permits lasting less than 10 years for \nprivate entities95 subject to review at any \ntime means that \u201cauthorizations generate \nlegal insecurity\u201d.\n\u2022 Opposition to certain aspects of the \nLGA related to regulation of wastewater \ndumping into water sources.96\n\u2022 The LGA establishes a confiscatory \nsanction rules with the creation of the \nWater Sanctions Tribunal with three \nmembers appointed by the president of \nthe republic.97\u2022 The law looks to shift authority over a \npublic resource such as water into private \nhands or agents, which would put water \naccess at risk for a large swath of the \npopulation.\n\u2022 It does not guarantee priority water use \nfor human consumption.\n\u2022 Unlike the State, the private sector has no \nmandate, mission, or authority to uphold \nthe common good or to defend citizens\u2019 \nrights.\n\u2022 While some countries in Latin America \nand the Caribbean have adopted different \nformats in which the private sector is \ninvolved in water management, none \nof them involve private actors in the \ngoverning body.24\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERANEP critiques of the UCA proposalUniversity and social movement organization critiques of the \nproposed institutional structure\nin the LIA\n\u2022 Technical, administrative, \nand financial governance \nshould be held by a \ndecentralized, autonomous \nauthority for comprehensive \nwater management. This \nauthority should not be \nunder the authority of the \nexecutive branch, that is, \nit should not be an official \nautonomous institution \nor a ministry, but rather a \ndecentralized institution free \nfrom political interests.\n\u2022 The most favorable \ngovernance structure is one \nthat transcends government \nadministrations. The \ngoverning body should be \napolitical.\u2022 The governing body for water should be composed of \npublic actors; other actors on the body would face \nconflict of interests in deciding on different water uses \nand volumes, rates, fines for wastewater dumping, and \nother critical issues.\n\u2022 The water authority proposed in the LIA prioritizes \nprivate participation and puts State representatives at \na disadvantage against the block of two private sector \nrepresentatives together with the COMURES appointees.\n\u2022 The LIA proposes a Watershed Consulting Committee, \nbut delegates all decision-making powers to the central \nwater authority. That is, the LIA proposes a Consulting \nCommittee that can be convened and invited to board \nmeetings to share their opinions, but the committee is not \ngiven a vote. In comparison, the space proposed by the \nUCA suggests a participatory mechanism that expands \ncitizen advocacy without sacrificing governance. This \ndesign establishes a National Water Council with broad \nparticipation, which would elect two of its members to \njoin the board of directors of the National Water Authority \n(ANA).\n\u2022 The LIA excludes members of political parties, labor \nunions or elected officials from participating on the board \nof directors of the Water Authority.\n\u2022 The lack of civil society participation prevents full \nrecognition of indigenous peoples\u2019 views and voices from \nthe communities that have been key actors in the local \nstruggles for water rights.\n\u2022 Water is a public good, and thus policies for water \nmanagement should be led by the State. Given the \nessential importance of water for life, citizen participation \nshould be guaranteed. This helps to prevent abuses and \noperates as a mechanism to favor transparency in water \ngovernance.\n\u2022 Decentralizing water management (in local committees \nand watershed zones) as suggested by the UCA is a key \nadaptation to protect water sources and watersheds, and \ndeal with the effects of climate change.Table 2. Main critiques of the current proposals for institutional structures\nSources: Developed internally based on testimony by the following institutions at the Legislative Assembly: UES, \nCASALCO, MOVIAC, PDDH, and ANEP, as well as opinions shared in the interviews conducted as part of this research \nproject.25\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERTables 1 and 2 clearly show the private sector \nconcerns and may be behind their interest \nin controlling decisions that could put the \nprofitability of their production activities at \nrisk. While some parts of the ANEP position \nare reasonable, such as the need to improve \nthe efficiency of the National Aqueducts \nand Sewers Administration (ANDA) to avoid \nwaste, or the intention to avoid politicizing \nthe governing body, the essential notion that \nwater is a vital public good and that human \nconsumption should be prioritized over the \nuse of water as a raw material in production is \nabsent. The detractors of the LIA are clear in \nmaking this argument.\nIt is also worth noting that while the language \nof the LGA is more gender-inclusive, neither \nthe LGA nor the LIA approach the issue of water \nmanagement with an adequate gender lens. \nThis report will further explore the gender lens \nin the section on recommendations.\nWATER, ELITES, AND POWER\nThe lack of a comprehensive regulatory \nframework for water management means that \nthere is no regulation in place for fundamental \nissues such as the exploitation of aquifers and \nrivers, allowable usage volumes for different \nconsumption types, consumption rates, and \nprevention and control measures to avoid \ncontamination (discharges into water sources), \nalong with other points. This lack of regulation \nand the fragmentation of different roles across \na spectrum of agencies without a single \ngoverning body to coordinate comprehensive \nwater management has been a breeding ground \nfor the proliferation of abuses and excess that \nhas led to a large part of the water crisis in El \nSalvador.\nSocial movement actors, consumer defense \norganizations, and non-governmental \norganizations all agreed in the interviews \nconducted for this research that companies \nfrom three main sectors make up the staunchest \nopposition to the LGA and a public institutional \nstructure as proposed by the UCA.  \n These sectors are: agroindustry in general \n(and sugarcane in particular), industrial \n(alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages), \nand construction (urban infrastructure \ndevelopment). Representatives from the water \nrights defense movement and academic actors \nagree that the current model, unregulated \nand without adequate payment system has \nended up prioritizing water use for a handful \nof companies from these sectors.98 Therefore, \nbehind the inaction that prevents progress in \nsolving El Salvador\u2019s water crisis, important \ninterests of the country\u2019s economic elite can \nbe identified. This does not invalidate the fact \nthat there are other interests at play associated \nwith other actors that also explains part of the \nparalysis. Nonetheless, the strong motivations \nof these companies to block the passage of \na regulatory framework on the subject \u2013 until \nsuch an omission becomes untenable - support \nfor the LIA and rejecting the MARN/UCA proposal \nis indisputable. \nIn the political field, the ARENA party has \nbeen one of the most influential actors in the \ndiscussions for a water law in the country. As \nshown, while this party resisted any progress \non water legislation for many years,99 ARENA \njoined representatives from GANA, PCN, and \nPDC to introduce the LIA legislation granting a \nmajority stake of participation to the private \nsector in the governing body in August 2017.\nThe ARENA party has had close ties to the \nSalvadoran economic elite since its founding,100 \nand prominent businessmen continue to be \namong the main donors to the party.\nIn recent years, after a long legal battle, political \nparties have begun to disclose their donors. \nAccording to these records, the ARENA party \nreceived 470 private donations from February \n2015 to May 2016.\nAmong the contributions that stand out are \nfrom five big Salvadoran businesses that \noperate in sectors, as indicated above, that \ndifferent sources have identified as those with \nthe most resistance to the approval of water \nlegislation. 101 The largest donors are: the Grupo 26\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERPoma companies, in the automobile sector, \nfinancial services, industry, and real estate,102,  \n103 (property of the Poma family); the Omnisport \ncompany (linked to the Suster family); the \nRoberto Due\u00f1as Limitada and Due\u00f1as Hermanos \nLimitada real estate companies (both owned by \nthe Due\u00f1as family, which also owns Urb\u00e1nica \nDesarrollos Inmobililiaros and has been the \nbuilder of luxury urban developments such \nas Puerta la Castellana, Puerta Los Faros, \nLa Gran V\u00eda Mall, and others,104 and, which \nSegovia (2018) reports, also holds operations \nin sugarcane production, transformation, \nsale, and export, and in private investment \nfunds;105 Compa\u00f1\u00eda Azucarera Salvadore\u00f1a and \nAlmacenadora del Pac\u00edfico S.A. de C.V. (linked \nto the Regalado family);106 Credisiman and \nDesarrollos  Inmobiliarios Comerciales S.A. de \nC.V. (linked to the Sim\u00e1n family);107 and Droguer\u00eda \nSanta Lucia (property of former president \nAlfredo Cristiani).108\nThe sugarcane sector stands out as a major \nplayer among the ARENA party donors. In \nfact, in March 2018, a group of Potable \nWater Administration Boards,109 churches, \nCommunity Development Associations \n(ADESCOS), community health committees, and \nlabor unions organized in the National Alliance \nagainst Water Privatization in El Salvador, \nsent a letter to the Legislative Assembly to \nshare their concerns caused by the data \npublished by the Presidential Secretariat for \nCitizen Participation, Transparency and Anti-\nCorruption, demonstrating that the sugarcane \nagroindustry in the country, particularly Grupo \nCASSA [the Salvadoran Sugar Company, or \nCompan\u00eda Azucarera Salvadore\u00f1a ], and the El \n\u00c1ngel, La Caba\u00f1a, Chaparristique and Jiboa \nsugar mills had all made important payments \nto the ARENA party.110\nThese companies, along with a number of \nothers, are organized in different industry \ngroups that make up the National Private \nEnterprise Association (ANEP), founded in 1966 \nto be a body that would represent much of the \nprivate sector in the country. ANEP\u2019s mission \nis to \u201cfoster and protect a system of free \nenterprise\u201d, and its vision is \u201cto be the entity that promotes and represents all entrepreneurs, \npromoting sustainable development in the \ncountry.\u201d According to data from its webpage, \nANEP \u201crepresents the productive and economic \nstrength of El Salvador, with 50 business groups \nfrom 55 economic subsectors, representing \nover 15,000 companies.\u201d111 Given its size, ANEP \nplays a considerable role in the governance of \nEl Salvador.\nANEP functions as a network of domestic and \nmultinational companies (banks, airlines, \nindustries, etc.) with political ties in the \ncountry. In fact, some of the members don\u2019t \nhesitate to publicly recognize that despite \nbeing an \u201capolitical\u201d body, the Association has \nwielded influence in political and economic \nrealms, providing information and making \nrecommendations for the governments in \npower.112 Beginning in 1989,113 the industry \ngroups began to have more visible influence \nin the country. For example, high-ranking \nrepresentatives in ANEP have run and been \nelected to public office, often under the \nauspices of the ARENA party (one former \npresident of ANEP was elected as President of \nEl Salvador through the ARENA party.)114 This \nreveals the linkages between both actors and \ntheir considerable influence in key aspects of \nnational life.115\nAmong the ANEP members with a substantial \ninterest in the terms of water governance \nare the Salvadoran Sugarcane Association \n[Asociaci\u00f3n Azucarera de El Salvador ], the \nChamber of Agriculture and Agroindustry of El \nSalvador [ C\u00e1mara Agropecuaria y Agroindustrial \nde El Salvador, CAMAGRO ], the Association \nof Sugarcane Producers [ Asociaci\u00f3n de \nProductores de Ca\u00f1a de Az\u00facar, PROCA\u00d1A ], \nthe Salvadoran Association of Bottled Water \nIndustries [ Asociaci\u00f3n Salvadore\u00f1a de \nIndustrias de Agua Envasada, ASIAGUA ], the \nSalvadoran Chamber of the Construction \nIndustry [ C\u00e1mara Salvadore\u00f1a de la Industria \nde la Construcci\u00f3n, CASALCO ], the American \nChamber of Commerce in El Salvador (AMCHAM), \nand the Salvadoran Industrial Association (ASI, \nwhich brings together large companies such \nas the Embotelladora La Cascada bottling 27\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERcompany, Industrias La Constancia, and \nothers from agroindustry such as Arrocera San \nFrancisco, CASSA, or Derivados de Ma\u00edz de El \nSalvador). ASI represents the interests of its \nmembers dedicated to industrial or associated \nactivities,117 and the association reports that \nits members account for 96.5% of the exports \nfrom the country.118 One of the ASI mandates \nis to protect and represent the interests of its \nmembers before national and international \nauthorities and institutions, and to \u201canalyze \nand study proposed legislation related to its \nmembers\u2019 interests, acting as an interlocutor \nfor their requests of the central government.\u201d119\nThe sugarcane sector, which includes the \nSalvadoran Sugarcane Association (and \nPROCA\u00d1A, which represents the cane producers) \nis a very important part of the national economy, \nand one which makes intensive use of water \nresources in the country.\nAccording to data from MARN in 2017, the \nsectors with the greatest demand for water \nin El Salvador were agriculture (51.8%), urban \nand rural household water supply (29.7%), and \nthermal energy (11.5%). These three sectors \ntogether represent 93% of the demand. \nAnother three sectors (aquaculture, industry, \nand hospitality) demand the remaining 7%.120 \nSugarcane is one of the most water-intensive \ncrops. Along with climate conditions, water \navailability is the decisive factor for crop growth. \nCrop water requirements are measured in crop \ncoefficients (Kc) established by the United \nNations Food and Agriculture Association (FAO) \nfor plant development (cultivation-growth-\nflowering-harvest). Kc can range from 0.45 to \n1.20. Whereas sugarcane Kc sits somewhere \nbetween 0.75 and 0.90, the crop coefficient \nfor most vegetable crops is between 0.60 and \n0.75.121\n \nThere are six sugar mills in the country (Central \nIzalco, Chaparrastique, El \u00c1ngel, La Caba\u00f1a, \nJiboa, and La Magdalena). Two families control \nnearly 70% of the domestic sugar market. The \nRegalado family owns the Central Izalco mill, \nand also is the majority shareholder of the \nChaparrastique mill. The Wright family owns the El \u00c1ngel mill and is the majority shareholder in \nthe La Magdalena mill.122\nCASALCO, which represents companies in \nthe construction and real estate sectors, is \nanother actor with enormous interest in water. \nAccording to studies by the Global Water \nPartnership for Central America, water supply \nfor human consumption (including supply for \ncommercial business projects) represents the \nsecond-highest demand for water; forecasts \nsuggest that this trend will hold steady.123\nAccording to the Water Forum, real estate \nexpansion, especially in the form of luxury \nresidential complexes, has produced \nparticularly high water consumption. These \nprojects are also large contaminators of water \nsources: residential developments in the \ncountry generally do not plan for wastewater \ntreatment facilities, leaving the waste to be \ndumped into rivers.124, 12528\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERCertain events in the real estate sector make it \neasy to see extreme inequality in water access. \nOne such case is the Potable Water System \nImprovement Project Trust for Southeast Santa \nTecla, Southeast Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n, Nuevo \nCuscatl\u00e1n, Zaragoza, and San Jos\u00e9 Villanueva, \nDepartment of La Libertad (FIHIDRO). The trust \nbeneficiaries include Grupo Roble and JOR, S.A., \nboth of whom are CASALCO members.\n \nGrupo Roble is the urban development wing \nof the Poma family conglomerate, one of \nthe wealthiest in the country and in Central \nAmerica,126 while JOR, S.A. de C.V. is one of the \nowners of the El Encanto Residential Country \nClub, a complex of luxury condominiums with \nswimming pools and golf courses built in the \nB\u00e1lsamo Range, in the municipality of San \nJos\u00e9 Villanueva (an area already facing water \nshortages).\nThe FIHIDRO project is a public-private \nagreement signed by the government in 2006, \nwhereby ANDA guarantees the water supply \nfor the municipalities of southeastern Santa \nTecla, southeastern Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n, Nuevo \nCuscatl\u00e1n, Zaragoza, and San Jos\u00e9 Villanueva. \nHowever, an investigative journalism report \nfrom the area conducted a decade later shows \nthat the municipalities in the B\u00e1lsamo Range \nare still waiting for their water supply, while the \nnew residential development projects built by \nthe aforementioned companies were granted \n\u201cpriority connections\u201d over the communities \nthat were already settled in the area.127, 128\nMany communities also voiced concern over the \nimpacts of real estate development projects \non water quality and environmental harm in \ngeneral. In October 2019, the Local Roundtable \nfor the Northern Zone of the B\u00e1lsamo Range, \npart of the Water Forum, filed two claims: one \nagainst the Paseo El Prado residential project \n(a Grupo Roble property) for failing to obtain \nthe appropriate environmental permit, and Box 4. Real estate, water, and inequality\nthe second against the treatment plant in the \nBrisas de Zaragoza-Etapa I project, for severe \ncontamination of the El Jute river (the main \nwater source for many local communities and in \nwhich, raw sewage is dumped).129\n29\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERSource: Developed internally from a number of sources. \nASIAGUA, an ANEP and ASI member, represents \nsome of the largest bottling companies in \nthe country: Industrias La Constancia, Agua \nAlpina, Las Perlitas, and Aquapura and Salud. \nThis sector also demonstrates the competition \nfor water use. Industrias La Constancia is \none of the main beverage producers in the \ncountry134 and a national and regional Coca-\nCola products distributor135 and since 2016, \nthe company is property of the multinational \ncompany Anheuser-Busch, InBev N.V./S.A. (AB \nInBev).  There have been complaints of the \ncompany\u2019s impact on water availability for \nlocal communities. Data collected by social \nmovement organizations such as Alianza por la \nSolidaridad reveal that this company has been \nextracting water from the Nejapa aquifer since \n1999, which has led to great concern because \nit is a strategic body of water, providing \npotable water for half of the population of \ngreater San Salvador. It should also be noted \nthat among the main reasons for concern is \nthe authorization granted to Constancia to set \nup in the area without an adequate analysis \nof short, medium or long term impacts, and \nthe precedent that it sought this option after \nthe exhaustion of the groundwater flow that \nsupplied its previous plant in Soyapongo.136\nBased on all of the above, it is important \nto underscore that an analysis of the \nstakeholders in water governance (political \nparties, business associations, leading figures \nand national economic elites) reveals the \nimmense economic and political power behind \nthe opposition to a legal framework on water \nmanagement that does not respond to their interests. While the economic elites of today \nlook quite different from Francisco Robles \nRivera\u2019s description (2017) of a \u201csmall and \nhighly cohesive group of oligarchs, landowners, \ncoffee plantation owners and agroexporters \nwith great political power and control over the \narmed forces\u201d as they once were in the XIX and \nXX century, they are now \u201cdiversified groups \nunder the control of one or more families\u201d that \neffectively deploy their powers in defense of \ntheir interests.137 The shared interests among \nthe powerful industrial structures help these \ngroups to accomplish their objectives. The \nfact that there is still no legislation in place to \naddress the verified water crisis in the country \nis a clear demonstration of this phenomenon \nat work.\nFrancisco Robles Rivera\u2019s statements are \nconsistent with another study by Waxenecker \nwith data from 2011 about Salvadoran big \nbusinesses, which examines overlapping \nmembers of their boards and management \nstructures. This study identified a sub-network \nof 175 large companies - legally registered in El \nSalvador - that make up a \u201chegemonic network \nwith shared interests and relationships.\u201d138 \n\u201cThis economic structure has strong ties \n- in a broad sense - to agriculture, as well \nas the finance sector, industry, trade, and \ntransportation. There are no apparent logic to \nthe business value chains or cluster economies \nwithin the network139, but it is characterized by \nits sub-structures around flagship companies \nand underlying family relationships.\u201d140 CASSA, \nfor example, sits in the first tier of flagship \ncompanies, defined by having shared control of Another similar example is that of the Finca El Espino area, a large state-owned forested plot that \nserved as the \u201clungs\u201d for San Salvador. After a series of donations and land concessions, parts of \nthe plot were sold to real estate developers and transformed into shopping malls and residential \nprojects.130, 131 In fact, in the year 2000 the Central American Water Tribunal132 ruled to \u201ccensure \nthe Government of El Salvador and the three branches of the State for unfair and irregular land \nuse management in the El Espino land, and consequentially the inhabitants of the San Salvador \nMetropolitan Area\u201d, and to \u201cdenounce that the Government of El Salvador had privileged private \ninterests at the expense of the common good...\u201d.13330\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERtheir boards of directors and high connectivity \nbetween sub-structures within the hegemonic \nnetwork itself.141 It is the flagship company in \nthe sugar sector in El Salvador and its board of \ndirectors is composed of several key players \namong the national elites.142 CASSA is also \npart of the Salvadoran Sugar Association, \nwhich is part of ASI and ANEP. In line with \nthese relationships, Waxenecker describes \nhow ANEP, CAMAGRO, FUSADES, and ASI have \nclose ties with big businesses, which \u201cenables \nthe representation of their common interests \nand defense of the status quo\u201d (Waxenecker, \n2017).143 All of the above, helps to identify \nthe main economic sectors that are the most \nsensitive to water governance, the multiple \nstructures where they overlap, and how they \nfunction as influencing platforms in the making of decisions of  public interest.\nFigure 4 shows a first-tier grouping within \nthe sector-specific associations, such as \nCASALCO, ASIAGUA, and CAMAGRO. Broader \ngroupings such as ASI and ANEP sit in a second \ntier. ANEP brings together the majority of the \nbusinesses and industry groups, and is thus an \nimportant actor in the national debate.\nThe interest of these sectors in discussions \non water legislation is clear when studying the \nofficial record of the CMCC in the Legislative \nAssembly: CASALCO, ASIAGUA, ASI, AMCHAM, \nand ANEP have all submitted opinions to the \nCommittee on the proposals for the General \nWater Law.\nFigure 4.

On the contrary, it is performed in \ncomplex political and social scenarios in which \nindividuals and groups with unequal power \ninteract in a shifting framework of rules to \ndefend opposing interests... the composition 32\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERof the group of actors participating in the \ndecision-making process has a fundamental \nbearing on policy selection and implementation, \nand in consequence, on the impact of these \npolicies on development outcomes.\u201d146 Certain \nactors can use their relatively greater power to \ninfluence and shape the process of formulation \nand the implementation of policies, norms, and \nregulations in service of their own interests and \nagendas, and against those of the majority. This \nstatement fits with the literature defining the \nphenomenon of political capture.\nCort\u00e9s and Itriago (2018) define capture as \u201cthe \nexercise of abusive influence by extractive \nelite(s) - in favor of their own interests and \npriorities and to the detriment of the general \ninterest - on the cycle of public policies \nand state agencies (or others regional or \ninternational reach), with potential impacts on \neconomic, political, or social inequality, and \nthe functions of democracy.\u201d147 Nonetheless, \nthe spectrum of possible forms of \u201ccapture\u201d is \nbroad, from a law to the state apparatus itself. \nIn fact, in the economic history of Latin America \nand the Caribbean, there have been extreme \ncases of capture nearly to the level of taking \ninstitutions themselves hostage when certain \nactors take over decision-making bodies, with \nimportant impacts on inequality and general \nwellbeing.148\nIn the context of this study, it can be said \nthat for over a decade, discussions in the \nLegislative Assembly on the General Water Law have been caught between paralysis \nand the threat of capture through control of \nthe governing body for water resources. This \nscenario has ended up limiting fair access to \nquality water for the population, especially for \npeople in the most vulnerable sectors of the \ncountry. Thus it is possible to hypothesize what \nis behind the failure to legislate on this matter \nis the intention to capture  the decision-making \nprocess on water regulation (and eventually \nwater governance itself) in the country. That \nis, the legislative process has been blocked \nfor so long in large part due to the threat that \nmore severe and restrictive water regulation \nthan that which exists now, would pose for the \neconomic elite, and the possibility it won\u2019t be \nthe elites that are in a position to decide on \nwater resource management in the country.\nAlthough the public information available for \nthis report did not include sufficient data to \nconfirm that there is a process of political \ncapture of water policy in El Salvador, it is at \nleast clear that there is a series of elements \nthat have created (and continue to create) \nideal conditions for the capture of this policy. \nIt is important to add that these conditions \ncould facilitate the capture of other relevant \npolicies for combating inequality. The factors \nthat could facilitate this capture, along with \nthe mechanisms to channel the interests of the \neconomic elite in this case, are organized in Box \n5 and Figure 5.\na. Economic actors sensitive to water governance with strong political influencing capacity\ndue to their resources:\n\u2022 Concentrated economic power: There is a group of economic elites characterized by their clear \neconomic power, and the concentration of this power into few hands/families.\n\u2022 Strong industry and political linkages: \u201cEconomic and political transformation processes in El \nSalvador have consolidated a sort of \u2018hegemonic economic-political right wing\u2019149 that self-\nperpetuates, with industry groups functioning as brokers between the economic and political Box 5. Some elements that could facilitate capture of water governance include:33\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERinterests that make up the ecosystem for these elites, in which the State has been an effective \ninstrument for the survival of these groups.\u201d150 The best example in this case has been the LIA, \nbacked by a large part of the private sector and political parties such as ARENA, PCN, GANA, and \nPDC. As Waxenecker (2017) argues and this report describes, the industry-political ties \u201cgrant a \nposition of social and political power to economic elites, allowing them to access public power \n(through elections, appointments, and/or the \u2018revolving door\u2019151), or through direct influence in \npolitical decision-making.\u201d152\nb. An enabling environment that may have facilitated blocking legislation:\n\u2022 The electoral climate and proximity to the 2019 presidential elections may have contributed to \nthe paralysis.\n\u2022 A CMCC chaired by ARENA and the new configuration of the Legislative Assembly in which the \nbalance of power favored right-with parties starting in May 2018 could also have blocked progress \non legislation, given the political ties to the Salvadoran economic elites, although clearly no \npolitical party has been capable of building the necessary consensus to make definitive progress \ntoward passage of water legislation that protects the interests of the majority.\nc. Structural components that facilitate capture: \n\u2022 Absence of or shortcomings in regulation in key areas such as political party financing, lobbying \nactivities,153 and revolving doors represent ideal ways for elites to make influencing inroads in \nfavor of their interests and agendas.\n- Political parties in El Salvador are financed through a mix of public and private funds, with \nfew regulations in place in terms of state contributions, and almost no regulations on private \ndonations. Parties can receive unlimited private donations in cash or in kind, with minimal \nlegal limitations.154 There is even less control in terms of funding for specific candidates or \ncampaigns.\n-The legal system fails to regulate interest brokerage155 (lobbying) and access to information \non lobbyists.156\n-There is also no regulation in the country on revolving doors. For example, there are no set \ntimelines (cooling-off periods) that public officials are required to respect before joining \nprofessional activities in the private sector - or vice versa - to reduce the risk of conflicts of \ninterest.157 There are also no controls on the handling of confidential, privileged, or sensitive \ninformation to which public officials may have had access in the course of their roles in public \noffice.158\nd. Mechanisms that may have facilitated the capture:\n\u2022 Functional cohesion between large segments of the economic and political elites in the country, \nmediated by industry groups, has materialized and been maintained through specific influencing \nmechanisms. Some of the most evident and traceable mechanisms include poorly-regulated \npolitical party financing and the use of organizations (such as think tanks, foundations, and \nresearch centers) with the capacity to influence the agenda, content, and approaches taken on \nkey issues in the country, that are sensitive to the interests and agendas of elite groups. Without \ndisregarding the influence these organizations hold over parts of public opinion, the mechanism \nis more of an \u201ccapture of ideas\u201d : rather than shaping public opinion in favor of the elites/LIA, the \nmechanism feeds into a monolithic position or static discourse from the economic and political 34\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERSource: Developed internally from a number of sources.\nFigure 5. Some elements from the theory of water governance capture in El Salvador.\nSource: Developed internally from a number of sources.elites that blocks the way for discussion among all relevant stakeholders to help break out of the \nparalysis around the regulatory framework on water. In fact, the public demonstrations of 2018 \nmentioned earlier are a clear symptom that a large part of the population has its own opinion on \nthe matter of water governance.\n\u2022 The historical dynamics of the economic elites in the country in favor of their own interests, the \npolitical strength of industry groups, and the lack of regulation on key matters that allow the \nelites to exert effective influencing power in the political workings of the country, are factors \nthat may have facilitated lobbying of the CMCC by (or on behalf of) the economic elites sensitive \nto water governance in favor of the LIA.159\n35\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERSECTION 5.\n \nUNREGULATED \nPOLITICAL PARTY \nFINANCING\nAs previously described, there are few \nrestrictions on political donations, and no limits \non campaign expenditures. The relationships \nbetween economic and political actors are \nvery close under this model. In effect, private \nfinancing (from party or non-party sources)160 \nis a permanent, important power component in \nSalvadoran politics.\nWhile the fact that a sector or group donates to \na political party is not - on its own - enough to \nargue that the party fully submits to the donor\u2019s \ninterest, there is no dispute that donations are \none of the most important mechanisms that the \neconomic elites use to influence politics.161 In \nthe case of El Salvador, Artiga-Gonz\u00e1lez (2011) \nargues that \u201cpolitical financing in general, and \npolitical party financing in particular, is a matter \nof enormous interest for politicians and other \npublic actors in El Salvador. But this interest is \nnot in the sense of establishing or improving \nregulations on the matter. Politicians\u2019 interest \nlies in their shared needs to meet these \nindividual, party, or institutional interests.\u201d162\nFor quite some time, political donations in El \nSalvador were kept out of the public eye. In \nrecent years, however, greater attention has \nbeen paid to the implications of this financing \nfor the construction of a truly democratic \ngovernance system. Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana, one \nof the most active Salvadoran civil society \norganizations in this field, points out that \u201cthe \nmoney that parties receive impacts the political \ndynamics of the country, enabling powerful \ngroups to co-opt state institutions and exert an excessive or undue influence on political \ndecisions, undermining the independence of \nstate agencies, elected officials, and political \nparties. In addition, the lack of controls on \npolitical donations and low levels of financial \ntransparency in political parties are favorable \nconditions for corruption.\u201d163\n \nThe Law for Access to Public Information \n(LAIP by its Spanish abbreviation) (2012),164 \nand the Political Party Law (LPP) (2013),165 are \nlegislative efforts to put legal regulations \nand institutional controls on political parties \nin the country, but oversight continues to be \ndeficient. In the words of Waxenecker (2017),166 \nthe flow of resources toward political parties \n\u201cbounces between legal and illegal, legitimate \nand illegitimate, and between what is visible \nand what is invisible.\u201d\nAccess to information on the financial dealings \nof political parties was finally feasible in 2017. \nThis access came after a process that involved \nAcci\u00f3n Ciudadana, the Institute for Access to \nPublic Information (the public institution in \ncharge of the application of the LAIP law, IAIP by \nits Spanish abbreviation), the Treasury Ministry, \nthe Constitutional Court, and the Administrative \nClaims Court.16736\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERThe importance of business donations\nin Salvadoran politics\nTwo reports from the Transparency and \nDemocracy Monitoring Center [ Centro de \nMonitoreo de Transparencia y Democracia ] \nof Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana analyze political party \nfinancing in El Salvador.   The first report, \n\u201cMoney, Politics, and Parties: Political \nfinancing in 2017\u201d [ Dinero, pol\u00edtica y partidos. \nEl financiamiento pol\u00edtico en 2017 ] covers \na period from 2014 to 2017, while the \nsecond report \u201cPolitical Financing in 2018: \nParty transparency and accountability\u201d [ El \nfinanciamiento pol\u00edtico en 2018: transparencia \ny rendici\u00f3n de cuentas de los partidos ] covers \nthe period from January 2018 to January \n2019.168 The 2018 report reveals that there is \nno oversight by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal \n(TSE) of political parties, as the TSE simply \nreceives the financial statements from the \nparties without performing financial audits \nof any sort. That is, the authenticity of the \ninformation reported is not verified.\nThe two reports examine the amounts that \neach party received, and the sources of these donations.  The resulting information paints a \nclear picture. Both reports show ARENA as the \nparty receiving the most private donations in \nEl Salvador, although other right-wing parties \nalso receive some contributions from many of \nthe same donors.\nA look at the ARENA party financing structure \noffers a view of the sectors that surround the \nparty, and can give some context to its position \nin support of private sector participation \nin water governance. According to Acci\u00f3n \nCiudadana, ARENA reported receiving 26.9 \nUSD in private donations from 2014 to 2017, \ncompared to 13.6 million USD reported by the \nFMLN, and 988,000 and 1.8 million USD reported \nby GANA and PCN, respectively.169  In other \nwords, in this period ARENA doubled the private \ndonations from its closest rival, the FMLN, \nand took in 25 times more in donations than \nthe GANA party. In 2018, ARENA received $10.2 \nmillion, compared to $1.9 million reported by \nthe FMLN, $229,000 reported by GANA, and $1.9 \nmillion for the PCN party. In this year, ARENA \nraked in almost five times more than the FMLN \nand 44 times more than GANA.170\nChart 3.

In \n2018, that first figure held steady at 65%.\nThe amount is not the only important information \nto help understand the interests behind political \nfinancing for each party. It is also important to \nknow who are making the donations. The origin \nof the funds for the different political parties \nsuggests some initial conclusions: private \ndonations come from individuals as well as \ncompanies, and some contributions come from \nparty members in specific geographic areas \n(undetermined donations).\nAccording to the data, there are important \ndistinctions in the type of private donors. In \n2018, the FMLN party had the greatest number \nof total individual donors (2,394), while ARENA \nhad the highest number of legal entities making \ndonations to the party (198).171 In fact, business \ncontributions to ARENA accounted for 87% of \nthe total business contributions, and individual \ndonations to the FMLN represented 65% of the \ntotal individual contributions for all political \nparties in the country in 2017.172\nAccording to research done by Acci\u00f3n \nCiudadana into ARENA party finances for 2017, \nsome individuals did make small donations \nto the party (in some cases for insignificant \namounts, as low as $1.00 for example), while \nthese same individuals also held high-level \npositions in companies that made large \ndonations.   This was the case for 34 individuals \nfrom 30 donor companies in 2017.173  This trend \nsubstantiates a previous observation from this \nreport of the presence of a business network \nin the country with overlapping actors in their \nleadership structures, which certainly expands \ntheir sphere of influence.\n \nThe data reveal a fabric of interests made up \nof individuals and companies. For example, \nJuan Carlos Calleja Hakker, the current Vice-\nPresident of Grupo Calleja (owner of the largest \nsupermarket chain in El Salvador and presidential \ncandidate under the ARENA party), donated $1,901.00 to the party, while the two companies \nin which he sits on the board donated a total \nof $877,735.00.174 Another example is that of \nJos\u00e9 Ricardo Poma Delgado, who made a $1.00 \ndonation in 2017, while the three companies \non whose boards he sits (Autof\u00e1cil, S.A. de C.V., \nDistribuidora de Autom\u00f3viles, S.A. de C.V.; and \nMetrocentro, S.A. de C.V.) donated a total of \n$722,855.27.175\nCalleja S.A. was the largest donor for the ARENA \nparty in 2017, followed by Compa\u00f1\u00eda Azucarera \nSalvadore\u00f1a, S.A. de C.V., and Metrocentro, S.A. \nde C.V.176 The four most important individual \ndonors for the party that year were: Juan J. Borja \nLetona (Grupo Borja Letona), Joaqu\u00edn Alberto\nPalomo Deneke (who sits on the boards of Grupo \nCASSA and Inversiones Las Brisas, which also \ndonate to the party), Carlos Roberto Saca Chahin \n(Grupo Carosa), and Mar\u00eda Florence Gladys Hill \nde Mathies.\nSimilarly, the top five companies that donated \nlarge quantities of money to ARENA in 2018, \naccounted for 39% of the total private \ncontributions to the party. These companies \nwere: Calleja S.A.; Metrocentro, S.A. de C.V.; \nDistribuidora de Autom\u00f3viles, S.A. de C.V.; \nCompa\u00f1\u00eda Azucarera Salvadore\u00f1a S.A. de C.V.; \nand Autof\u00e1cil, S.A. de C.V.177. The names of the \nleading individual donors to the ARENA party \nin 2018 coincide with many of the prominent \nbusinessmen from the aforementioned \ncompanies: Luis Alfredo Escalante Sol, Antonio \nJuan Cristiani Burkard, Carlos Enrique Araujo \nEserski, Carlos Le\u00f3n Imberton Deneke, Carlos \nRoberto Saca Chahin, Mar\u00eda Florence Gladys Hill \nde Mathies, Joaqu\u00edn Alberto Palomo Deneke and \nAlfredo F\u00e9lix Cristiani Burkard178.\nThe 2017 report also identifies some businesses \nthat funded the three right-wing parties: ARENA, \nPCN, and PDC. In 2017,179 seven companies \ndonated to the three parties with Compa\u00f1\u00eda \nAzucarera Salvadore\u00f1a S.A. de C.V. making \nthe largest contributions..  The information \nshows that this company donated a total of \n$710,000.00: ARENA received $430,000.00, with \n$200,000.00 for the PCN and $80,000.00 for the \nPDC.18038\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERIt is also important to note that in addition to \ndonations from individuals and their companies \nto the three parties at the same time, the \ndata show that board members on companies \nthat donated to a political party also sit on \nthe boards of other companies that donated \nto the same party. According to data provided \nby Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana, this dynamic occurs \nonly in the case of the ARENA party, where 74 \ncompanies contributing to the party share 84 \nboard members among them. Some of these \nboard members hold positions in up to eight \ncompanies at once.181 The chairman of the \nboard on one company may be a director in \nanother company, a deputy board secretary in \nanother, etc.182\n \nThe difference compared to the rest of the \npolitical parties in El Salvador is dramatic. The \nlargest donor for ARENA in 2017 was Calleja \nS.A. de C.V., which contributed $871,780.01, \ncompared to the largest donation for the FMLN \nat $16,379.17, contributed by an individual, \nSantiago Flores Alfaro (himself an FMLN \nlegislator).183, 184 In 2018, the FMLN received \n$22,868.00 from four companies in the country; \nIndustrias Facela S.A. de C.V. made the largest \nof these donations, at $11,300.00. The total \ndonations for the FMLN from private hands \nrepresented less than 1% of all of the private \nrevenue for political parties in that year.185\nARENA\u2019s funding scheme in particular allows, \nand in practice encourages, the creation of a  \nsignificant radius of influence by funders, where \nan intricate business network concentrates \nthat capacity.\n \nEconomic sectors and funding for\nSalvadoran political parties\n \nIn 2018, the main sector that made political \ncontributions in El Salvador was commerce \n($5,183,196.10), followed by real estate \n($2,102,360.00) and agro-industrial companies \nin third place at $1,819,620.52.186 The \nconstruction sector follows close behind, in \nfifth place.187 The combined contributions from \nreal estate, agroindustry, and construction \ncompanies accounted for 32% of the total donations that year.188\nFurther, an analysis of the subsectors reveals \nthat out of 81 specified sectors, real estate \nactivities (companies dedicated to purchase, \nsale, and rental of properties and provision of \nother real estate services), sugarcane, and \nconstruction companies represented the first, \nfourth, and sixth positions, respectively, were \namong the subsectors making the greatest \npolitical party donations in 2018; nearly 3 of \nevery 10 dollars donated came from these \nsubsectors.189\nThis is consistent with the position of Grupo \nCASSA as the leading donor for the ARENA, PDC, \nand PCN parties in 2017. The real estate and \nconstruction sectors also played an important \nrole as funders for these parties.  For example, \nthe Due\u00f1as Hermanos LTDA company, an ARENA \nand PCN donor, works in the construction sector \nand has ties with Desarrollos Inmobiliarios \nUrb\u00e1nica (the construction company for the \nPortal del Casco Norte, Puerta La Castellana and \nPuerta Los Faros urban development projects in \nthe former El Espino plot, and in the La Gran V\u00eda \nmall).190 The construction sector also includes \nMetrocentro, S.A. de C.V., which is the third \nlargest donor for the ARENA party. Metrocentro, \npart of Grupo Roble,191 belongs to the previously \nmentioned business conglomerate, Grupo \nPoma. \nThe sugarcane, real estate, and construction \nindustries belong to the sectors with the \ngreatest economic muscle in El Salvador. These \nare also the industries for whom water access \nis essential. In this regard, it is reasonable to \nconclude that they have a particular interest \nin ensuring a private sector presence in any \ngoverning body created by water legislation. \nThree of the main private donors to political \nparties also hail from these industries, as \ndemonstrated by the Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana data.\nUnder this scenario, what is certainly \nquestionable are the implications of political \nrepresentativeness of the parties with respect \nto the interests and needs of their voters, and \nthus on democracy itself. Eduardo Escobar, 39\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERExecutive Director of Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana shared \nthat the \u201clargest donors to parties have a \nparticular interest in making that donation, and \nin this case, it is to receive at least one benefit \nfrom the official financed, or that official does \nnot interfere with the company\u2019s interests..\u201d192\nAs stated earlier, funding from certain sectors \nfor political parties does not necessarily entail \na mechanical submission to their interests.  It \ncannot be ignored, for example, that there may \nbe tensions even within sectors that donate to \none or several parties; these tensions vary with \ntime and context. Nonetheless, it is reasonable \nto state that the political party donation \nsystem in place in El Salvador helps to blur the \nlimits between the interests of large economic \ngroups and those of the parties to which they \ncontribute. Without a doubt, this is an enabling \nenvironment for the capture of institutions and \ndemocratic spaces. Through the party financing \nsystem, a network of family groups and \ncompanies with enormous resources can easily \nexacerbate the existing power imbalances \nin key decision-making spaces, such as the \nLegislative Assembly.40\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERSECTION 6.\n \nCAPTURE \nOF IDEAS \nAND STATIC \nDISCOURSE\nThe central idea in the debate around the water \ngoverning body in El Salvador has to do with \nthe concept of water resources as primarily a \nmarket product, pitted against the assertion of \nwater as a human right or a \u201cpublic good\u201d, which \nwould require the State to take governance \nauthority. These opposing visions around water \ngovernance are also expressed in theoretical \nand conceptual terms, with a battle of discourse \nwaged among think tanks and academics.\n \nThe actors who view water as a principally \ncommercial resource are supported by a series \nof organizations, think tanks, and different \nassociations that argue this vision in events, \nconferences, and publications supported by \nlocal, regional, and global traditional and social \nmedia. On a national level, FUSADES and the \nSalvadoran Business Council for Sustainable \nDevelopment ( Consejo Empresarial Salvadore\u00f1o \npara el Desarrollo Sostenible, CEDES)  are two \nsuch institutions that frequently articulate \nthis view in international networks. CEDES is \na local chapter of the World Business Council \nfor Sustainable Development, and FUSADES \nis part of at least 23 networks that \u201cpromote \npublic policy in areas such as transparency, \nfiscal responsibility, defense of democratic \ninstitutions, freedom of expression, and \nentrepreneurship, among others.\u201d193\n \nFUSADES self-identifies as an \u201cindependent \nthink tank and development center committed \nto progress and wellbeing for all Salvadorans\u201d, and it is perhaps the most influential political \nthink tank in El Salvador. According to a ranking \npublished on its webpage, FUSADES held \nthe 27th position among think tanks in Latin \nAmerica, and the first spot in Central America \nin 2014. FUSADES was once again ranked first in \nthe nation in 2018 along with Fundaungo on the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania Global Go To Think \nTank Index (GGTTI, 2017).194 FUSADES is among \nthe \u201cmost important organizations linked to the \nSalvadoran private sector, and one which tends \nto represent their interests in public policy \ndiscussions with the government.\u201d195 FUSADES \nhas defended private sector representation in \nwater governance,196 and its board of directors \nis composed of ARENA party members from the \nmain economic sectors of the country.197\nFor example, in an article published on the \nFUSADES webpage in 2015, one of the FUSADES \nboard members from that period raised a \nseries of critiques of the legislation proposed \nby MARN in 2012, highlighting the institutional \nweakness that resulted from - in his \njudgement - low private sector participation.198 \nA report published by Contrapunto in April \n2013 also detailed the FUSADES position \nin favor of private sector inclusion in the \ngoverning body.199  The issue of institutions \ninvolved in water governance also appears \nin other FUSADES publications, such as \n\u201cWater Resources in El Salvador: importance, \nmanagement, and participation\u201d [ Recursos \nh\u00eddricos en El Salvador, importancia, gesti\u00f3n 41\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERy participaci\u00f3n ],200 which focuses on the \nconcept of participation,  calling for inclusion \nof the State, society, and productive sectors in \nthe governing body.\nFor its part, CEDES\u2019 objective is to \u201clead on \nmatters of corporate sustainability with the \nbusiness community and promote the concept \nas a core component of corporate strategy, \nwith participation from government and civil \nsociety.\u201d The CEDES board of directors includes \nrepresentatives from companies such as \nHolcim El Salvador, Pettenati Centroam\u00e9rica, \nBanco Davivienda, Agrisal Inmobiliario, Unilever, \nHanes Brands, Grupo CASSA, Diario El Mundo, \nGrupo Borja, Lactolac, TermoEncogibles, and \nothers.201 CEDES has also defended the ANEP \nproposal, arguing that the law proposed by \nMARN is anti-private sector and \u201climits [private] \nsector participation, and fails to recognize \npotential private contributions for integrated \nwater resource management.\u201d202\nSince 2000, ANEP has organized the National \nGathering of Private Enterprise (ENADE), an \nannual event that produces position documents \non different topics of national importance. \nWater governance has also held a prominent \nposition in ENADE publications. The proposed \nLaw for Comprehensive Water Management \nintroduced by the irrigation agriculture sector203 \nwas the subject of the conference in 2014, \ngiving the private sector a privileged position to \ninfluence in decision-making.\nThis scenario fits with what Zepeda (2015) \nidentifies as the \u201celephant in the room\u201d strategy, \nalluding to the idea that privileged actors \npopulate strategic spaces for debate with such \nan overwhelming presence - acting as an omni-\npresent block - which often condemns any other \nvoices to the margins. The Global Water Forum \nheld in 2012 is one example of this strategy.  \nThe cost to get in the door at this event was 350 \neuros for people from developing countries and \n700 euros for participants from Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \ncountries. For the majority of the Salvadoran \npopulation, the cost for participation in this \nevent represented several times their monthly income -- it is not difficult to imagine that \nthe interests of grassroots organizations \nand community members affected by water \nshortages were not represented at the event and \ntheir concerns did not make it on the agenda. \nZepeda goes one step further by documenting \ninterviews with members of the community of \nSan Jos\u00e9 Villanueva, one of the areas affected \nby water shortages. Zepeda indicates that the \ncommunity members \u201cdo not complain, and did \nnot complain, about their absence from this \nforum because they are entirely unaware of the \nspaces that they should \u201coccupy\u201d to influence \nthe debate on water in their country, or even the \npossibility of their doing so.\u201d204      \nAnother example of think tanks or policy \ncenters influencing the agenda and content of \npublic interest discussions has to do with the \nway that these groups promote their interests \nby taking ownership of concepts traditionally \nused and cited by the communities, such \nas \u201cparticipation\u201d. These actors thus look to \nsafeguard their interests and push for space \non the governing body for water administration \nby arguing that this body should be open to \n\u201cparticipation\u201d from the private sector. As \nseen above, FUSADES referenced the concept \nof participation to support the inclusion of \nthe private sector on the governing body. \nWhile recognizing the importance of hearing \nprivate sector voices on such a key issue for \ntheir economic activities, the problem is that \nthere are certain forms of participation on \nthe governing body that could lead to serious \nconflicts of interest and significant imbalances \nin its favor, to exert power over water access \nand use.42\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERSECTION 7.\n \nUNREGULATED \nLOBBYING\nThis same research has faced the limitations \nimposed by the lack of effective regulations on \nlobbying activities in the country. It has been \nnearly impossible to obtain detailed information \non the dynamics and interactions between \ndifferent stakeholders in the conflict around \nwater regulations in the Legislative Assembly. \nWhile ethical and transparent lobbying \nactivities can benefit policy development and \ndemocracy, it is also true that without effective \nregulation, lobbying can also pose a threat \nwhen these interest groups lack transparency. \nThe lack of transparency is less than ideal on \nits own, but it also \u201copens the door to illicit \nor illegitimate representation of interests, \ndeference to specific private interests over \nthe collective good, or use of state institutions \nin function of these private interests.\u201d205 \nCurrently, \u201ctransparency in these activities is \nnon-existent; citizens are unaware of these \nlobbying activities, whose interests are being \nrepresented, who is representing them, or \nwhich officials are being lobbied.\u201d206\nIn March 2019, Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana requested \ninformation on the meeting agendas and \nschedules for the representatives in the \nLegislative Assembly. This information request \nasked for the topic and goal of the meetings \nheld, the sectors that participated, who \nfacilitated the contacts, and other information. \nIn addition, Acci\u00f3n presented an amendment \nto the LAIP  to declassify this information.207 \n\u201cThe information request submitted to the \nLegislative Assembly was denied, forcing litigation with the IAIP to try to obtain the data. \nIAIP ruled that information on meeting agendas \nor audiences granted and held with legislators \nat the Legislative Assembly is public, and thus \nshould be made available to citizens.\u201d208 IAIP \ninstructed the Legislative Assembly to pass \nregulations to this end. At that time, however, \nonly one legislator - Leonardo Bonilla, the \nfirst legislator with no party affiliation in the \nLegislative Assembly in El Salvador - handed \nover the requested information, even only \npartially.209 The Legislative Assembly filed an \nappeal with the Administrative Dispute Court to \nrevert the IAIP ruling, arguing that it was illegal. \nThe Administrative Dispute Court has yet to rule \non this appeal.210\nThe lack of regulation on these matters is \nanother factor that may influence the style and \nsubstance of the debates on water governance \nin the country. This situation underscores the \nenormous difference in resources and lobbying \ncapacity between the sectors promoting the \ndifferent proposals in the Legislative Assembly. \nGreater transparency could reveal clearer \nevidence of the role that lobbying plays in the \ndebate on water legislation.43\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWER\nSECTION 8.\n \nCONCLUDING \nREMARKSThe water crisis in El Salvador, associated \nin large part with the lack of regulation for \nwater resources, is a national problem that \ndoes not affect everyone equally. Women, \npeople living in rural areas or poor urban \nsettlements, and people living in poverty \nface the most severe consequences.44\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERDespite an important citizen movement \ndemanding the adoption of a General Water \nLaw that could fill many of these legal gaps, \ndiscussions in the Legislative Assembly have \nstagnated for over a decade.\nThe economic sectors that are in large part \nresponsible for the water crisis in the country, \nand who demonstrate ties to and influence \nover  the political dynamics, could be playing an \nimportant role to block legislation such as the \nLGA. These sectors also appear to be unwilling \nto allow the establishment of a governing body \nconfigured in accordance with the UCA proposal. \nIf legislation is eventually passed, the interests \nof these powerful actors would appear to be \nbetter represented in the LIA.\nThere is an enabling environment for these \nsectors with their undeniable power to exert \nexcessive influence in the political debate on \nwater governance. Their close ties with industry \ngroups and political parties pose a serious threat \nto equity in the policy-making process for issues \nof public interest. Given the lack or failure of \neffective regulation and control measures, this \npowerful economic and political block allows \nthe interests and agendas of the economic \nelites to easily and substantially influence \nthe dynamics of institutional configuration in \nthe country (that is, the legal and regulatory \nframeworks and their implementing structures \nin the country).\nThe essential thesis of this study is that beyond \nthe ideological stance and historical aspects \nthat explain these linkages, they materialize \nand are sustained through influencing and \ncapture mechanisms. Some of the most \nidentifiable mechanisms include unregulated \nparty financing, and support from organizations \n(such as think tanks, foundations, or research \ncenters) with the capacity to influence both the\nagenda and the contents and approaches \nto issues discussed in the country that are \nsensitive to the interests and agendas of the \nelite. These organizations build a monolithic \nposition (static discourse) that blocks \nconstructive dialogue among stakeholders in \nthe conflict around the water law, producing a version of what is referred to as \u201ccapture \nof ideas\u201d . The lack of regulation and access \nto information on lobbying activities raises \nreasonable doubts about the use of this \nmechanism to ensure that the elites sensitive \nto water governance has had more space to \nadvocate with the Legislative Assembly.\nFrom a political equity standpoint, the problem \nemerges when the outsized political influencing \ncapacity wielded by certain actors (elites) \nneutralizes the perspectives and interests \nof any other actor, regardless of the issue or \nnegotiations. Given the power and resources \nheld by parts of the economic elite - the group \nmost sensitive to water governance issues - \nand the functional cohesion of these economic \ngroups with the political elites, the imbalance \nin their favor configures a structural advantage \nin policy or regulatory debates. This imbalance \nis the ideal breeding ground for economic and \nsocial inequality to reproduce.  That is, this \nadvantage has the potential to act in detriment  \nand at a disadvantage to opposing actors to the \ninterests of the economic elite, or an elite group \nthat aligns with the political elite.\nIn addition to describing the conflict around \ninequality in water access, this report seeks to \noffer recommendations to level the playing field \nfor political negotiation, and thus to facilitate \nthe adoption of a regulatory framework that can \nensure respect for the human right to water for \nall Salvadorans.45\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWER\nSECTION 9.\n \nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nHOW TO LEVEL THE \nPLAYING FIELD \nFOR POLITICAL \nNEGOTIATION?\nReduciendo v\u00edas espec\u00edficas por donde pueda \nproducirse una influencia desmedida de grupos \nde poder en pro de sus intereses211:  \na.

This of \ncourse includes taking every necessary \nprecaution to protect natural water \nsources and using cutting-edge measures \nfor climate change adaptation to mitigate \nnegative impacts on water availability. \nThe state should play a leading role in \nwater management under this law, and \nparticipation mechanisms should ensure \nequity in capacity and participation by all \nof the sectors affected by the water crisis \nin the country.\n\u2022 The contents of the law should be \ndesigned with a gender lens. That is, the \nlaw should explicitly recognize how the \nlack of assurances for continued access \nto quality water for human consumption \nwill disproportionately affect women given \ntheir social assigned roles and care work for \ntheir households. Matters such as service provision, rates, and general procedures \nfor water access should thus be designed \nwith an eye toward this reality, to reduce or \nminimize the gender inequality stemming \nfrom unequal access to water. This also \nincludes the design of institutional \nstructures for water management that \nensure representation for women\u2019s voices \nand interests.\n    \n\u2022 Recognize the right to water in the \nConstitution of the Republic, and establish \nthe duty to produce a regulatory framework \nand national policy for water management \nand protection.\n48\nEL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERNOTES\n1  See details on the National Administration for Aqueducts and Sewers (ANDA) (2017) Plan Nacional de \nAgua Potable y Saneamiento de El Salvador .

FMLN Parliamentary \nGroup Website. Available at: http://www.gpfmln.sv/index.php/art-opinion/item/586-11101901\n90  According to Legislative Assembly records and remarks by FUNDE in 2019.\n91  Remarks by ANEP before the Legislative Assembly.\n92  To make this argument, ANEP raises the following questions: MARN has 23 additional responsibilities. \nMARN is in charge of granting, modifying, suspending, or revoking permits and establishing rates for \nwater extraction and discharge. ANEP also raises a critique that the law grants regulatory powers to \nsectoral ministries that only have administrative jurisdictions, and that the law grants \u201cauthority\u201d to the \nMARN over sectoral ministries and agencies connected to water issues such as MAG, MINEC, and SIGET \n(General Superintendent for Electricity and Communications).\n93  Article 120 of the LGA provides that \u201cto appropriately protect water quantity and quality, MARN may \nestablish protected sites within 300-400 meters from rivers, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, groundwater \nsources, and wells. MARN shall have the power to regulate land use and activities conducted in these \nzones.\u201d\n94  Article 87 of the LGA establishes that \u201cMARN is obligated to notify requesting individuals or entities \nof their resolutions, as well as extensions or other measures related to water use, including discharge, \nin accordance with the timeframes established in the law.\u201d \u201cIf MARN fails to notify the claimant of the \nresolution, this omission shall be interpreted as a denial of the request. In this scenario, the claimant \nsubmit the corresponding appeal for review.\u201d\n95  The LGA sets public designations for periods under 20 years.\n96  In its critiques, ANEP argues that \u201cthe law establishes a canon for wastewater discharge to recipients \nthat are part of the public water domain such as rivers and lakes (Articles 103, 104, 108, 109), which will \nbe collected by MARN. This assumes that in turn, MARN will provide wastewater treatment services and \ncontaminant removal. Nonetheless, the law itself requires that wastewaters discharged by companies \nhave a given quality, and to be \u201cpreviously treated\u201d to avoid contamination. Additionally, \u201cANDA has a \nbroad sewage network that contaminates rivers at many points, and is again exempt from payment of \nthis canon\u201d. \n97  Classification of fines for violations as proposed in the LGA: Less severe violations from the equivalent \nof 1 to 1,000 minimum monthly wages, and severe violations from the equivalent of 1,001 to 20,000 \nmonthly minimum wages (up to approximately 4.52 million dollars).\n98  Gies, H.

The key agency for developing national rice policy is \ndirectly controlled - not influenced - by the rice production sector, and this control is established in \nthe law. The board of directors of this agency, the National Rice Corporation (CONARROZ), is made up of \nrepresentatives from different segments of the rice value chain; the public sector is represented on \nthe board of directors but these representatives hold a minority position and lack practical authority \nto determine the policy framework. In fact, the capture is so absolute that the executive branch can \nalter a key element in rice policy: rice importation tariffs. Nonetheless, the policy has followed CONARROZ \nguidelines in this matter. The main beneficiaries of this institutional arrangement and policy framework \nhave been large-scale producers, to the detriment of small farmers and the poorest population for \nwhom rice expenses represent a larger slice of their family income.
