Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner won  \nre-elect ion to the presidency in October 2011 in multi- party elections the media \nand various nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) described as generally free \nand fair.   The country also held legislative  midterm elections on October 27.  \nSecurity forces reported to civilian authorities but occasionally acted at lower levels independently of civilian control  and committed human rights abuses.  \n The principal human rights problems included reports of torture by provincial police, harsh prison conditions, and gender violence.  \n Other human rights problems included use of excessive force by police; occasional arbitrary arrest and detention; prolonged pretrial detention; actions that risked  \nimpairing freedom of the press ; continued concerns about judicial inefficiency ; \nofficial corruption; child abuse; continuing discrimination against and \ninfringements on the rights of indigenous people; sex trafficking ; forced labor, \nprimarily within the country; and child labor.  \n Judicial authorities prosecuted a number of officials who committed abuses during the year; however, some officials engaged in corruption or other abuses with \nimpunity.  \n \nSection 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:  \n \na. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life  \n \nThere were reports of deaths as a result of the police\u2019s use of unwarranted or \nexcessive force.   Federal security forces have the authority to conduct internal \ninvestigations into alleged abuses and to fire individuals who have allegedly \ncommitted a human rights violation.   \n \nOn September 30, two policemen from the metropolitan police and Buenos Aires \nprovince police  force  shot and killed a 29 -year -old man  after an argument.  The \nsecurity secretary asserted that one of the policem en intentionally fired his  weapon , \nand remanded the case to the judge to investigate .  \n  ARGENTINA 2 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  The NGO Coordinator Against Police Repression (CORREPI) reported in July that \nsecurity forces using excessive force killed 56 persons during the first half of the \nyear.  The Center for Legal and Social Studies (CELS) reported deaths as a result \nof police using unwarranted or excessive force in the city of Buenos Aires and \nBuenos Aires Province during the first half of the year.  \n \nb. Disappearance  \n \nThere were no reports of politically motivated disappearan ces. \n \nAuthorities continued to investigate and prosecute individuals implicated in \ndisappearances, killings,  and torture committed during the 1976- 83 military \ndictatorship (widely referred to as the \u201cDirty War\u201d).   Investigations into the \n\u201csystematic plan\u201d of the military dictatorship, including the appropriation of \nchildren of detainees and the killing of detainees on \u201cdeath fligh ts,\u201d continued or \nbegan during the year .  CELS estimated that 381 judicial investigations were active  \nby May, in which 2,088 persons were charged for crimes against humanity.   \nAccording to the Attorney General\u2019s Office for Follow- up on Crimes Against \nHumanity, from January to October the courts convicted 76 individuals for \ncommitting human rights abuses during the 1976- 83 perio d and continued trials \nthat were suspended in 1989- 90 when the government issued a blanket pardon.  \nFor example, i n September  a criminal court of a ppeals upheld a conviction for the  \ntorture and murder of Carlos Moreno, a union representative and worker at the \nLoma Negra company .  The tribunal sentenced  three former army officials and two \ncivilians to prison for their involvement in the case , ruling for the first time since \nthese cases resumed that civilians had participat ed in crimes against humanity . \n \nJudicial authorities continued to investigate cases of kidnapping and illegal \nadoption of children born to detained dissidents by members of the former military \ndictatorship.   In April  a judge sentenced  a couple who illegally adopted the son of \na disappeared family to six years in prison.  The individual who illegally offered \nthe baby  to the couple  also faced charges for identity theft.   The NGO Abuelas de \nla Plaza de Mayo reported the number of persons illegally adopted by former \nmilitary officials and later identified and made aware of their background increased to 109 of an estimated 500 born to detained and missing dissidents during the former military dictatorship.  \n The Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF) continued cooperation with the government in the identification of remains of Dirty War victims.  In August   ARGENTINA 3 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  the National Institute of Industrial Technology (INTI) and the EAAF  signed an \nagreement for INTI to provide technical support and assistance to the EAAF . \n \nc. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman,  or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment  \n \nThe law prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \npunishment and provides penalties for torture similar to those for homicide .  \nNevertheless, international organizations, CELS, the Office of the National Public \nProsecuto r, and the Buenos Aires Provincial Memory Commission\u2019s Committee \nAgainst Torture (an autonomous office established by the provincial government) \nreported complaints of torture perpetrated by provincia l and federal prison \nofficials.   \n \nIn September members of the Coordination and Follow -up System of \nPenitentiaries--a federal system with representatives from the Criminal Superior \nTribunal, the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office, the National Defender\u2019s Office, the \nFederal Penitentiary , and CELS --visited various  federal prisons.  Their findings \nprompted the closure of some areas of Marcos Paz Penitentiary  in Buenos Aires \nProvince, where cells lack ed electricity and bathrooms,  and prisoners waited up to \nthree  months for  access to shower facilities.  \n \nAccording to the 2012 annual report of the Buenos Aires Provincial Memory \nCommission\u2019s Committee Against Torture, deficiencies in food or health care and \npractices such as beatings, threats, and forced isolation remained comm on in \nprisons in the province of Buenos Aires.   The report of the April 2012 prison visits \nof the UN special rapporteur on t orture was not available by December . \n \nPrison and Detention Center Conditions  \n \nPrison conditions often were harsh .  Inmates in many facilities suffered from \nextreme overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate medical and psychological treatment, inadequate sanitation, limited family visits, and frequent degrading treatment, according to various reports by human rights organizations and re search \ncenters . \n \nPhysical Conditions\n:  The number of prisoners in Buenos Aires provincial \npenitentiaries was approximately 30,000 and exceeded facility capacity by an \nestimated 92 percent, according to a 2010 report by the provincial Council of \nDefenders .  Prison capacity  in federal penitentiaries was adequate, according to t he  ARGENTINA 4 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  Federal Penitentiary  Service, with slightly more than 9,800 inmates in federal \nprisons and more than 10,900 beds.  \n \nAuthorities held w omen separately from men, and the law permits children to stay \nin prison with their mothers until the age of four .  According to the Federal \nPenitentiary Service, 785 women were in federal prisons.  Women constituted 8 percent of the overall prison population.  CELS estimated that 60 percent of the \nwomen incarcerated in Buenos Aires provincial prisons were in pretrial detention \nor awaiting sentencing, and many were held with convicted prisoners.   In general \nmen\u2019s prisons were more violent, dangerous, and crowded than women\u2019s prisons.  \n \nOvercrowding in j uvenile facilities often resulted in minors being held in police \nstation facilities, even though some NGOs and the n ational prison ombudsman \nwarned the law prohibited doing so.  \n \nNGOs and media reports alleged poor prison conditions in several provinces.  On \nApril 14, a fire in a prison in the city of Rosario killed three prisoners and injured \nseven others.   The lead prosecutor at the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office of \nInstitutional Violence described current prison conditions as a \u201cconstant and \nmassive violatio n of human rights\u201d affecting 60,000 to 65,000 detainees.  \n Prisoners received potable water.  \n \nAdministration\n:  Information on the adequacy of recordkeeping and alternatives to \nsentencing for nonviolent offenders was unavailable .  Prisoners and detainees \ngenerally had access to visitors and could observe their religious practices.  \nAuthorities permitted prisoners and detainees to submit complaints to judicial \nauthorities without censorship and to request investigation of credible allegations \nof inhumane co nditions.   Some local NGOs noted, however,  that access to a public \ndefender was sometimes limited and that prisoners occasionally did not submit complaints to authorities due to fear of reprisal.   \n In August the national director of the Federal Penitentiar y Service , Victor Hortel,  \nresigned following complaints of alleged official complicity after 13 high-risk \nprisoners escaped from Ezeiza Penitentiary by  digging a tunnel and breaking four \nboundary fences.  \n Independent Monitoring\n:  The government permitted independent prison visits by \nlocal and international human rights observers, and such visits took place during the year.   ARGENTINA 5 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor   \nd. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention  \n \nThe law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government gener ally \nobserved these prohibitions; however, police reportedly arrested and detained \ncitizens arbitrarily on occasion.  \n \nRole of the Police and Security Apparatus \n \nThe federal police normally have jurisdiction for maintaining law and order in the \nfederal capi tal and for federal crimes in the provinces.  Other federal police \nauthorities include the airport security police, Gendarmerie, Coast Guard, and \nBureau of Prisons .  All federal police forces fall under the authority of the Security \nMinistry.   Each province and the city of Buenos Aires also has its own police force \nthat responds to a provincial (or city) security ministry or secretariat.  Individual forces varied considerably in their effectiveness and respect for human rights.   In \nlate August , as a measure to combat growing insecurity , Security Minister Arturo \nPuricelli dispatched 5,000 additional Gendarmerie officers  to assume urban \npolicing duties in the province of Buenos Aires.   In order to avoid leaving the \nborders unprotected, the army agre ed to send  soldiers to cooperate with the \nGendarmerie in the  border area with  Brazil and Uruguay . \n Federal security forces have the authority to conduct internal investigations into \nalleged abuses and to fire individuals who have allegedly committed a huma n \nrights violation .  The federal government can also file complaints with the federal \ncourts , and provincial governments can  do the same for provincial security forces.  \n \nMembers of security forces convicted of a crime were subject to stiff penalties.  \nGenerally authorities administratively suspended officers accused of wrongdoing \nuntil their investigations were completed.  Authorities investigated and in some \ncases  detained, prosecuted, and convicted the officers involved.  \n \nArrest Procedures and Treatment of  Detainees  \n \nPolice generally apprehended individuals openly with warrants based on sufficient evidence and issued by a duly authorized official.  P olice may detain suspects for \nup to 10 hours without an arrest warrant if a uthorities have a well-founded belief \nthat the suspects have committed or are about to commit a crime , or police  are \nunable to determine the suspect\u2019s  identity .  Human rights groups reported police  ARGENTINA 6 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  occasionally arrested persons arbitrarily and detained sus pects longer than 10 \nhours.  \n \nThe law provides a detainee with the right to a prompt determination of the legality \nof the detention  by a lower criminal court judge, who determines whether to \nproceed with an investigation.  In some cases t here were delays in  this process and \nin informing detainees of the charges against them.  \n \nThe law provides for the right to bail except in cases involving narcotics, violent \ncrimes, and firearms violations.  \n \nAuthorities allowed d etainees prompt access to counsel and provided public \ndefenders  in cases where they were  unable to afford counsel.   In some cases  such \naccess was delayed due to an overburdened system.  \n \nPretrial Detention :  The law provides for investigative detention of up to two years \nfor indicted persons aw aiting or undergoing trial; the period may be extended by \none year in limited circumstances .  The slow pace of the justice system often \nresulted in lengthy detentions beyond the period stipulated by law.  According to \nstatistics from the Federal Penitentia ry Service , more than 5,400 detainees (of \n9,800 prisoners) in federal prisons were  in pretrial detention, awaiting sentencing, \nor awaiting the appeals process.  According to several human rights organizations, \n30 percent of pretrial detainees were eventual ly acquitted.  A convicted prisoner \nusually receives credit for time already served.  \n \ne. Denial of Fair Public Trial  \n \nThe law provides for the right to a fair trial, and the independent judiciary generally enforced this right.  J udicial scholars continued to report inefficiencies \nand delays in the judicial system , and Chief Justice Lorenzetti asked criminal \njudges to speed up proceedings.  According to some local NGOs, judges in some federal criminal and ordinary courts were subject occasionally to politica l \nmanipulation.  \n Delays, procedural logjams, long gaps in the appointment of judges, inadequate administrative support, and general inefficiency hampered the judicial system .  \nNGOs also criticized all three branches of the government for inefficiencies in the \nprocess for selecting judges.  Judges\u2019 broad discretion on  whether and how to \npursue investigations contributed to a public perception that many decisions were arbitrary.   ARGENTINA 7 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor   \nIn May  the National Congress approv ed a six-part presidential judicial reform \nproject, including a Council of Magistrates reform law .  In June the Supreme Court \nruled four articles of the law unconstitutional , striking  down a provision to select \nnew judges by popular election,  stating  it disrupted the institution\u2019s balance of \npower a nd challenged judicial independence .  In early May the UN s pecial \nrapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers  expressed concern over \nparts of the project.  \n \nTrial Procedures  \n \nTrials are public .  In federal and provincial courts,  defendants enjoy a presumption \nof innocence and have the right to appeal, have legal counsel, and call defense \nwitnesses.   If needed, a public defender is provided at public expense when \ndefendants face serious criminal charges.   During the investigative stage, \ndefendants can submit questions in writing to the investigating judge .  A panel of \njudges decides guilt or innocence .  Although defendants and their attorneys have \naccess to government -held evidence, local NGOs indicated that  defendants  \nsometimes experienced obstacles or delays in obtaining such evidence .  Defendants \ncan present witnesses and provide expert witness reports, in addition to the \ndefendant\u2019s own evidence.   Lengthy delays in trials occurred nationwide, with \nmany cases taking five or more years to resolve.  \n \nFederal and provincial courts continued the transition to trials with oral arguments \nin criminal cases, replacing the old system of written submissions.  Although the \n1994 constitution provides for trial by jury , implementing legislation was not \npassed by November .  In Cordoba Province, however, defendants accused of \ncertain serious crimes have the right to a trial by jury , and the province of Buenos \nAires passed similar legislation in September.  \n An unofficially  organized juvenile justice system operated in eight of 18 districts \nin Buenos Aires P rovince .  It provides minors between the ages of 16 and 18 with \nthe same procedural rights as adults and limits sentences to 180 days in prison.  \n \nPolitical Prisoners and Detainees \n \nThere were no reports of political prisoners or detainees.  \n \nCivil Judicial Procedures and Remedies  \n  ARGENTINA 8 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  Citizens have access to the courts to bring lawsuits seeking damages or the \nprotection of rights provided by the constitution.  Local  observers criticized \nvarious interested parties, including the government,  for seeking to pressure judges \nand shape judicial outc omes to benefit the government.  \n \nRegional Human Rights Court Decisions  \n \nThe country  is subject to the jurisdiction of the Inte r-American Court of Human \nRights .  In May the court ordered the country to reform the juvenile justice system \nto adhere to regional and international human rights conventions  to avoid violating \nminor prisoners\u2019 human rights.  \n  \nf. Arbitrary Interference wit h Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence  \n \nThe constitution prohibits such actions, and the government generally respected these prohibitions.  \n \nIn late April Cordoba P rovince police attempted without a warrant to evict 60 \nfamilies squatting on vacant property.  \n \nSection 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:  \n \na. Freedom of Speech and Press  \n \nThe constitution provides for freedom of speech and press; the government \ngenerally respected these rights.   Independent newspapers, radio and television \noutlet s, and i nternet sites were numerous and active, expressing a wide variety of \nviews.   Private media outlets were independent from the national and provincial \ngovernments.  \n Press Freedoms\n:  All major supermarket and home appliance retailers ceased \nadvertising in newspapers in February.   Although retailers privately claim ed the \nDomestic Trade Secretariat ordered this action to weaken independent media companies, no retailers publicly made this claim, which the government denied.  \nWhile the limitation was in place , paid advertising decreased an estimated 70 \npercent , which organizations such as the Inter American Press Association (IAPA), \nthe International Association of Broadcasting, and the Argentine Association of \nNews Organizations cited  as endanger ing press freedom through economic \ndamage.  The Consumers Union of Argentina launched a campaign protesting the \nban on advertising.  In July the government sanctioned the organization for  ARGENTINA 9 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  misusing public funds to defend private media companies.   Following changes in \npersonnel at the federal level, including a new secretary of domestic c ommerce, \nthere were indications ne ar the end of the year that the  restrictions had been lifted.  \nIn December m any supermarkets resumed buying advertising in print and \naudiovi sual news media . \n \nDespite previous Supreme Court rulings ordering the government to apply \nreasonable balance in the distribution of public advertising,  placement of official \nadvertising  remain ed arbitrary .  In 2012 media outlets critical of the government \nreceived a disproportionately small fraction of the total public advertising budget.  \nOfficial data show ed that media groups close to the government obtained more \nthan 45 percent  of public advertising from 2009  to 2012.  The two newspapers with \nthe highest circulation and both critical of the government received less than 1  \npercent of the total public advertising budget.  During the year  the government \nagreed to abide by a 2009 federal appeals court ruling that withholding government \nadvertising from Editorial Perfil outlets generally critical of the government violated freedom of the press as guaranteed in the constitution.  As  of October , \nhowever,  the amount of  public advertising  in Editorial Perfil outlets was only \nbetween 7 percent  and 16  percent  of court -ordered levels.  \n \nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of the constitutionality of a  media law  passed in \n2009 but still not fully implemented.   On November 4, Clarin Group presented a \nvoluntary divestment plan to comply with the law , which remained under \ngovernment study in December.  \n \nViolence and Harassment\n:  The Argentine Journalism Forum , an NGO promoting \nfreedom of expression, reported 1 52 attacks on freedom of expression between \nJanuary and Septem ber, up 32 percen t from the same period in 201 2. \n \nOn April 26, Buenos Aires city police agents attacked a group of 11 journalists and \nphotographers from different media outlets who were covering a union protest at \nBorda m ental health hospital.   Police arrested one  journalist and inj ured several \nothers with rubber bullets.   In reporting the Borda incident and  two other  capital \ncity police attacks on journalists, CELs concluded that  repeated attacks on  \njournalists visibly carrying microphones or cameras in their hands seemed intended \nto prevent the recording and reporting of violent actions by police personnel.  \n \nOn August18, following a television report by Clarin Group journalist Jorge Lanata on cases o f alleged corruption, the s ecretary general of the p residency, \nOscar Parrilli, issued a press release calling Lanata \u201ca contract killer hired by  ARGENTINA 10 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  Magnetto\u201d (Clarin Group\u2019s chief executive officer ) and asserting his objective was \nto \u201cspread hate\u201d against Pre sident Cristina Kirchner .  Parrilli  subsequently added \nduring a radio interview that Lanata was a \u201ckiller operating in the media.\u201d  IAPA \ncriticized those comments, warning  they could  trigger \u201cmore attacks against \njournalists.\u201d  \n \nCensorship or Content Restr ictions :  In August public television Channel 7 \nremoved news anchor Juan Miceli from its  daily news br oadcast after an interview \nin which his questioning upset a ruling party congressperson.  Other Channel 7 \nprograms  subsequently discredited Miceli , who was eventually  dismissed.  \n \nActions to Expand Press Freedom  \n \nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of a blogger being sued by a public university \nofficial for defamation,  stating  that opinions on the internet are protected by the \nsame rights as those in traditional print or broadcast media .  The court dismissed \nthe case because the plaintiff was not able to prove actual malice.   In another case \nthe Civil and Commercial Court of Appeals ruled against a petition by a dental services company requesting Google to blo ck negative comments against the \norganization.  \n \nInternet Freedom  \n \nThere were no generalized restrictions on access to the internet or credible reports \nthat the government monitored e -mail or i nternet chat rooms without appropriate \nlegal authority .  Individuals and groups could engage in the expression of views \nvia the internet , including by e -mail and social networks.  The International \nTelecommunication Union reported that 56 percent of individuals in the country  \nused the i nternet during the year . \n \nAcademic Freedom and Cultural Events  \n \nThere were no government restrictions on academic freedom or cultural events.  \n \nb. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association  \n \nThe constitution provides for freedom of assembly and association, and the \ngovernment generally respected these rights.  \n \nc. Freedom of Religion   ARGENTINA 11 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor   \nSee the Department of State\u2019s International Religious Freedom Report  \nat www.state.gov/j/drl/irf/rpt . \n \nd. Freedom of Movement, Internally Displaced  Persons, Protection of \nRefugees, and Stateless Persons  \n \nThe constitution provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation,  and the government generally respected these rights.  \n \nThe government cooperated with the Offi ce of the UN High Commissioner for \nRefugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in providing protection \nand assistance to refugees, asylum seekers, and other persons of concern.   \nAccording to the UNHCR, as of January there were 3,488 refugees and 1,921 \nasylum seekers residing in the country .  \n \nProtection of Refugees  \n \nAccess to Asylum\n:  Laws provide for the granting of refugee status, and the \ngovernment has established a system for providing protection to refugees.  \n \nStatistics were not available on the number of individuals to whom the National Committee for Refugees granted refugee status, the number of asylum cases \npending, or the  total number of  petitions filed during the year .  Decisions on \nasylum petitions may ta ke up to two years to adjudicate . \n \nSection 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their \nGovernment  \n \nThe constitution provides citizens the right to change their government peacefully, \nand citizens exercised this right through peri odic, free, and fair elections based on \nuniversal suffrage.  \n \nElections and Political Participation  \n \nRecent Elections\n:  In October 2011 voters re -elected President Cristina Fernandez \nde Kirchner of the Front for Victory coalition in polling described by media and \nvarious NGOs as free and fair.   The country h eld legislative midterm elections on \nOctober 27.   Voters elect ed one-half of the members of the Chamber of Deputies,  \nrepresenting all 2 3 provinces and the c ity of Buenos Aires,  and one -third of those  ARGENTINA 12 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  in the Senate , representing eight provinces.   Local observers considered these \nelections generally free and fair.   \n \nFollowing 2012 legislation on voting rights, voters age s 16 and17 were added to \nthe electoral register for the first time and participated in the August primary \nelections.  \n \nParticipation of Women and Minorities :  Regulations provide that at least one -third \nof the candidates on election slates for both houses of  congress must be women.  \nThere were 2 8 women in the 72- seat Senate and 90  women in the 257- seat \nChamber of Deputies.   The president, two of the seven Supreme Court justices, and \ntwo cabinet ministers were women.   (A third woman cabinet minister moved to a  \ndiplomatic post in May .)  No known ethnic or racial minorities were in the national \nlegislature.   There were no known indigenous, ethnic, or racial minorities in the \ncabinet or on the Supreme Court.  \n \nSection 4. Corruption and Lack of Transparency in Gover nment  \n \nThe law provides criminal penalties for corruption by officials; however, multiple \nreports alleged that executive, legislative, and judicial officials engaged in corrupt practices with impunity, suggesting a failure to implement the law effectively.  \n Weak institutions and an often ineffective and politicized judicial system \nundermined systematic attempts to curb corruption.  \n \nCorruption\n:  Cases of corruption occur red in some security forces.  The most \nfrequent abuses included extortion of, and protection for, those involved in drug \ntrafficking and prostitution.  \n \nOn September 3, a federal court in Cordoba P rovince imposed a six-month \nsuspended sentence on former transportation secretary Ricardo  Jaime  for \nconcealing documents connected with a judicial investigation for illicit enrichment.   \nIn June a judge in  Misiones  Province  indicted police commissioner Hector  Ojeda,  \nthe then head of the Investigations Unit in  Iguazu  Falls and  one of  Governor Closs\u2019 \nbodyguard s, for alleged  involvement in the robberies of supermarkets and a \nfinancial company .  Ojeda was  under investigation  for alleged ly cover ing up the \nactivities of  drug traffickers and criminals in the tri -border area.  \n \nAllegations of corruption in provincial as well as in federal courts remained \nfrequent.   ARGENTINA 13 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor   \nVice President Amado Boudou remained under investigation for illicit enrichment and for using his former position as m inister of economy to benefit the Old Fund \nCompany, a firm in which he ha d a financial interest.   Although Federal Judge \nAriel Lijo rejected Boudou\u2019s request to throw out the case in August, Cassation Court Judge Javier De Luca ruled in November that courts must immediately assess the evidence in order to continue the case.   Additionally Federal Judge \nNorberto Oyarbide was investigating Boudou in connection with funds that \ndisappeared during Boudou\u2019s administration of the country\u2019s social security \nadministration.  \n \nOn June 14, a court convicted former president Carlos Menem and former d efense \nminister Oscar Camilio n of arms  smuggling to Ecuador and Croatia  and sentenced \nthem to five to seven years\u2019 imprisonment.   Menem also was indicted  for his \nalleged  responsibility in the 1995  explosion in  a military factory in Rio Tercero , \nCordoba Province, which resulted in seven  deaths and 300 persons injur ed.  As a \nsenator, Menem holds immunity.  \n \nThe case charging that former president Fernando de la Rua  and senior members of \nhis cabinet bribed national senators in 2000 to vote for the amendment of a labor \nlaw continued at year\u2019s end.  \n \nWhistleblower Protection\n:  Criminal code provisions oblige  public officials to file \ncomplaints if they witness irregularities.   Public employment laws protect officials \nfrom termination of employment in such cases but do not cover other forms of retaliation.   Cases of corruption can be anonymously reported to the Anticorruption \nOffice of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rig hts. \n Financial Disclosure\n:  Public officials are subject to financial disclosure laws, and \nthe Ministry of Justice\u2019s Anti -Corruption Office (ACO) is responsible for \nanalyzing and investigating federal executive branch officials based on their financial di sclosure forms.  Laws provide for public disclosure, but not all agencies \ncomplied, and enforcement remained a problem, since authorities did not sanction \npublic officials for noncompliance .  The ACO is also responsible for investigating \ncorruption within the federal executive branch or in matters involving federal \nfunds, except for funds transferred to the provinces.  As part of the executive \nbranch, the ACO does not have authority to prosecute cases independently, but it \ncan refer cases to other agencies or serve as the plaintiff and request a judge to initiate a case.  \n  ARGENTINA 14 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  Public Access to Information :  While the country does not have a law that provides \nfor public access to government information, a presidential decree provides for \naccess to public documents and information that fall within the jurisdiction of the \nexecutive .  In August the  Supreme Court ordered judges\u2019 affidavits to be posted on \nthe Supreme Court\u2019s website.   A September report by a local NGO reported \ncontinuing  arbitrary rejections of request s for information, allegedly violating the \nHabeas Data Law , which specifically provides public access to judicial records and \nreports of  judges\u2019 personal assets.  \n \nSection 5. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and \nNongovernmental Investigation of  Alleged Violations of Human Rights  \n \nA wide variety of domestic and international human rights groups generally operated without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases .  Government officials usually were cooperative \nand generally responsive to their views.  \n \nGovernment Human Rights Bodies\n:  The government has a Human Rights \nSecretariat.   Its main objective is to collaborate with the Ministry of Justice, \nSecurity and Human rights to promote policies, plans,  and programs for the \nprotection of human rights.   During the year it published leaflets and books on a \nrange of human rights topics.  \n \nIn June Prosecutor  General Alejandra Gils-Carbo inaugurated the Office of Crimes \nAgainst Humanity , charged with investiga ting and documenting human rights \nviolations that occurred under the military dictatorship of 1976- 83.  \n \nIn July  the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance created the Commission for \nMemory, Truth and Justice  to compile information about the workers of the \nministry who were persecuted, detained, kidnapped, disappeare d, or killed during \nthe military dictatorship.  \n \nSection 6. Discrimination, Societal Abuses, and Trafficking in Persons  \n \nThe law prohibits discriminat ion based on race, gender, sexual orientation, \ndisability, language, or social status, and the government generally enforced these \nprohibitions.  \n \nWomen  \n  ARGENTINA 15 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  Rape and Domestic Violence :  Rape, including spousal rape, is a crime, but \nevidentiary requirements, either in the form of clear physical injury or the \ntestimony of a witness, often presented difficulties in prosecuting such crimes.  The penalties for rape range from six months\u2019 to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.  There \nwere no reports of police or judicial relucta nce to act on rape cases; however,  \nwomen\u2019s rights advocates claimed that attitudes of police, hospitals, and courts \ntoward survivors of sexual violence sometimes revictimized the individual.  \n No statistics were available on the number of rape cases  reporte d during the year .  \nMany rapes went unreported due to fear of further violence, retribution, and social \nstigma.  \n \nThe law prohibits domestic violence, including spousal abuse, and complaints are addressed in civil courts to secure protection measures.  Family court judges have the right to bar a perpetrator from a victim\u2019s home or workplace .  The law requires \nthe state to open a criminal investigation potentially resulting in life imprisonment \nin cases where violence results in death.  In November 2012 C ongress passed the \nFemicide Law, imposing stricter penalties on those who kill their spouses, partners, \nor children as a consequence of gender violence .  In July  the executive  branch  \nenacted a law creat ing a national DNA registry  of sex criminals.  Accordi ng to \nlocal NGOs, lack of police and judicial vigilance often led to a lack of protection \nfor victims.  \n \nDomestic violence against women was a problem .  The civil society organization \nLa Casa del Encuentro reported that 209  women died between January and \nSeptember as a result of domestic or gender -based violence .  Approximately half \nof these cases occurred in the provinces of  Buenos Aires, Cordoba , and Santa Fe.   \nOf these killings, 68  percent involved a husband, boyfriend, or former boyfriend. \nIn at least 20  cases, the woman had filed a complaint against the aggressor for \ndomestic violence.  \n \nThe Supreme Court\u2019s Office of Domestic Violence provided around-the -clock \nprotection and resour ces to victims of domestic violence.  The office received \napproximately 830 cases of domestic violence each month in the city of Buenos \nAires, an estimated 64  percent of which involved violence against women.   The \noffice also carried out risk assessments necessary to obtain a restraining order .  The \n\u201cVictims against Violence Program ,\u201d which operated in the city of Buenos Aires \nand Chaco Province, empowers a team of specialists from the Justice and Security \nMinistry  to assist victims of domestic violence .  The program reported an average \nof 700 telephone calls  per month.   ARGENTINA 16 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor   \nSince 2008 there have been 1,236 reported cases of femicide .  Since the highly \npublicized murder of  Wanda Taddei , who was burned to death by her husband in \n2010, there have been 66 similar killings, including seven in the first half of the \nyear.  \n The Ministry of Social Development of the p rovince of Buenos Aires reported  221 \nformal complaints of physical abuse against women during the first three months \nof the year .  Individuals age s 20 to30 constituted a  majority of the victims, and 53 \npercent  of the cases involved  psychological  and emotional mistreatment.  \n \nPursuant to an October 2012  agreement, the Office of Domestic Violence and the \nSecurity Ministry trained  members of the Federal Polic e, Navy , and Gendarmerie  \nin the city of Buenos Aires on domestic violence intervention.   Statistics on the \nnumber trained were not available at the end of the year.  \n \nPublic and private institutions offered prevention programs and provided support \nand treat ment for abused women.  The Buenos Aires Municipal Government \noperated a small shelter for battered women.  \n \nSexual Harassment\n:  The law prohibits sexual harassment in the public sector  and \nimpose s disciplinary or corrective measures.  In some jurisdictions, such as Buenos \nAires City, sexual harassment may lead to the abuser\u2019s dismissal, whereas in \nothers, such as Santa Fe Province, the maximum penalty is five days in prison.  \n \nReproductive Rights :  Couples and individuals generally had the right to decide \nfreely the number, spacing, and timing of children and had the information and means to do so free from discrimination, coercion, and violence .  Access to \ninformation on contraception and skilled a ttendance at delivery and in postpartum \ncare were widely available .  The law requires the government to provide free \ncontraceptives, and an estimated 64 to70 percent of women used modern \ncontraceptive means.   \n Discrimination\n:  Although women enjoyed equal rights under the law, including \nproperty rights, they continued to face economic discrimination and held a disproportionately high number of lower -paying jobs.  Women also held \nsignificantly fewer executive positions in the private sector than men, accordi ng to \nseveral studies.  Although equal payment for equal work is constitutionally \nmandated, the 2013 Global Gender Gap Report estimated that women earned approximately 58 percent as much as men for similar or equal work.    ARGENTINA 17 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor   \nThe Supreme Court\u2019s Office of Wom en trains judges, secretaries, and clerks to \ndeal with court cases related to women\u2019s issues; it also seeks to ensure equal access for women to positions in the court system .  The office also trained judges, \nprosecutors, judicial staff, and law enforcement agents to increase awareness of \ngender -related crimes  and develop techniques to deal with gender -related cases and \nvictims.  \n \nChildren  \n \nBirth Registration\n:  The country provided universal birth registration, and \ncitizenship was derived both by birth within  the country\u2019s territory and from one\u2019s \nparents.  Parents have 40 days to register births, and the state has an additional 20 \ndays to do so.  The Ministry of Interior may issue birth certificates to children under age 12 whose births were not previously re gistered.  \n Child Abuse\n:  Child abuse was common; for example, the Office of Domestic \nViolence reported that 30 percent of the cases it received per month involved children.  \n Forced and Early Marriage\n:  The legal minimum age of marriage for men and \nwomen is 18. \n \nSexual Exploitation of Children :  Sexual exploitation of children, including in \nprostitution, was a problem.  The minimum age of consensual sex is 18.  There is a \nstatutory rape law with penalties ranging from six months to 15 years in prison, \ndepending on the age of the victim.  Additionally, regardless of age, if a judge \nfinds evidence of deception, violence, threats, abuse of authority, or any other form of intimidation or coercion resulting in sexual intercourse, the minimum sentence \nincreases to six years.   Several prominent cases of child sexual abuse were reported \nduring the year.   During the first half of the year, the Ministry of Justice program \nVictims against Violence assisted 329 minors who were victims of sexual abuse.  \n \nThe law prohibi ts the production and distribution of child pornography with \npenalties ranging from six months to four years in prison.  While the law does not prohibit the possession of child pornography by individuals for personal use, it \nprovides penalties ranging from  four months to two years in prison for possession \nof child pornography with the intent to distribute it.  Additionally the law provides \npenalties ranging from one month to three years i n prison for facilitating access to \npornographic shows or materials to minors under the age of 14.   ARGENTINA 18 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor   \nDuring the year prosecutors and police pursued cases of internet child \npornography.  In August Federal Police arrested 30 individuals  for producing and \ndistributing child pornography online.  They  discovered 1,500 CDs, computers,  \nand external disks with pornographic material.  \n On July 30, authorities in Cordoba  arrested a teacher for distributing child \npornography  online , charging him  with distribution and commercialization of child \npornography .  After conviction, a cou rt sentenced t he individual  to two years\u2019 \nimprisonment.  \n \nInternational Child Abductions\n:  The country is a party to the 1980 Hague \nConvention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.  For \ninformation see the Department of State\u2019s report on compliance at \nhttp://travel.state.gov/abduction/resources/congressreport/congressreport_4308.h\ntml as well as country -specific information \nat http://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_5875.html . \n \nAnti -Semitism  \n \nThe Jewish community consisted of approximately 250,000 person s.  Sporadic acts \nof anti-Semitic discrimination and vandalism continued.  The Delegation of Argentine Jewish Associations (DAIA) received complaints of anti -Semitism \nduring the year.  \n The most commonly reported anti-Semitic incidents were virtual slurs posted on various websites, graffiti, verbal slurs, and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries.  \nIn 2012 the DAIA received 243  distinct reports of anti-Semitic behavior .  The city \nof Buenos Aires had the most cases filed, and the  DAIA claimed cases in the \nprovinces were likely underreported.  On March 19, the municipality of General Campos,  Entre R ios Province , distributed tax-payment receipts printed with the \nsentence: \u201cBe  a patriot, kill a Jew .\u201d  The DAIA declared that municipal authorities \nwere responsible for the bill  and demanded administrative sanctions and removal \nfrom office of the responsible party.  \n The investigation continued into the 1994 bombing of the Argentina Israelite \nMutual Association (AMIA) community center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 \npersons .  The federal prosecutor investigating the case continued to seek the arrest \nof eight Iranians for their alleged involvement in the bombing.  E arly in the year  \nthe government ratified a memorandum of understanding with I ran to jointly  ARGENTINA 19 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  investigate the AMIA case , and the government continue d to negotiate with Iran on \nthe specifics of the agreement\u2019s implementation.  Jewish community \nrepresentatives and opposition political leaders continue d to criticize the \ngovernment for e ngaging in a n unclearly conditioned political dialogue and \nexpressed concerns that it could undermine the country\u2019s existing judicial \ninvestigation.   Jewish organizations AMIA and DAIA filed suit against the \nagreement in July, arguing that the accord is un constitutional.  \n \nThe Buenos Aires City g overnment partnered with the interfaith organization \nBridge Builders and the French Alliance to sponsor a series of  monthly  film \npresentations and discussions to promote religious understanding.  \n \nTrafficking in Persons \n \nSee the Department of State\u2019s Trafficking in Persons Report  at \nwww.state.gov/j/tip . \n \nPersons with Disabilities  \n \nThe constitution and laws prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, \nsensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities in employment, education, air travel \nand other transportation, access to health care, or the provision of other state services .  A specific law also mandates access to buildings by  persons with \ndisabilities.  While the federal government has protective laws, many provinces have not adopted the laws and have no mechanisms to ensure enforcement.  An employment quota law reserves 4 percent of federal government jobs for persons with disabilities, but NGOs and advocacy groups claimed the quota often was not \nrespected.  \n \nAccording to the Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security, more than \n12,000 persons with disabilities had obtained jobs through the ministry\u2019s programs in the city of Buenos Aires as of May 2011 .  The  programs included various \nbenefits for workers  with disabilities, such as free job training programs.  \n A pattern of inadequate facilities and poor conditions continued in some mental institutions .  For example, a press report from April addressed deficien t \ninfrastructure and human rights violations in Buen Pastor Psychiatric Hospital in Bell Ville , Cordoba Province.  The report described prisoners living in \n\u201cconcentration camp\u201d conditions with open sewers infested with insects and bat s\u2019 \nnests in kitchen fa cilities.  Governor De la Sota committed to improving services  ARGENTINA 20 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  through increased financial support and advocated to end  confinement practices for \npatients with less severe disabilities.  \n \nIn early February, following a 2012 request from more than 30 NGOs, the Buenos \nAires City education ministry issued regulations to allow children with disabilities \nto attend schools with their therapists and health -care companions .  The effort \naimed  to promote the inclusion of children with disabilities in schools that also \nadmit children without disabilities.  In October three NGOs submitted a report to \nthe UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,  sharing concern over \ndiscrepancies between domestic legislation and international conventions that \nguarantee right s to pe rsons  with disabilities .  The NGOs also claimed Argentina \nwas falling short  of compliance with the UN c ommittee\u2019s 2012 recommendations \nto the country.  \n \nIn August and October, official voting centers for primary and legislative mid-term \nelections provided special voting tables and braille ballot holders,  making the \nvoting process accessible to persons with disab ilities. \n The National Advisory Committee for the Integration of People with Disabilities under the National Council for Coordination of Social Policies has formal \nresponsibility for actions to accommodate persons with disabilities.  The \ngovernment\u2019s actions to improve respect for the rights of persons with disabilities included a program started in September 2012 by Buenos Aires Province tha t \nestablishes economic incentives for municipalities that hire persons with disabilities as civil servants.  The program stipulated that municipalities \nparticipating in the program would receive a subsidy payment from the provincial Ministry of Labor.   \n \nIndigenous People  \n \nThe constitution recognizes the ethnic and cultural identities of indigenous people and states that congress shall protect their right to bilingual education, recognize their communities and the communal ownership of their ancestral lands,  and allow \nfor their participation in the management of their natural resources.  Indigenous people did not fully participate in the management of their lands or natural resources, in part because responsibility for implementing the law is delegated to \nthe 23 provinces, only 11 of which have constitutions recognizing indigenous \nrights.  \n  ARGENTINA 21 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  Although there is no formal process to recognize indigenous tribes or determine \nwho is an indigenous person, indigenous communities can register with the provincial or feder al government as civic associations.  A 2010 survey conducted \nby the National Statistics and Census Institute recorded an indigenous population \nof more than 780,000.   \n \nDuring his visit to the country in late 2011, the UN special rapporteur on the r ights \nof indigenous people , James Anaya , found the \u201chistorical exclusion of indigenous \npeoples is still very apparent,\u201d manifested by \u201cthe inadequate protection of their rights to their traditional lands, and their continuing marginalization and \ndiscrimination.\u201d  Poverty rates were higher than average in areas with large \nindigenous populations .  Indigenous people had greater than average rates of \nilliteracy, chronic disease, and unemployment.  Indigenous women faced further \ndiscrimination based on gender and reduced economic status.  The lack of trained \nteachers hampered government efforts to offer bilingual education opportunities to indigenous people.  \n \nThe special rapporteur\u2019s report indicated indigenous peoples continued to lack \nadequate participation in decisions affecting their ancestral lands.  It added that \nprojects carried out by the agricultural and extractive industries displaced \nindividuals, limited their access to traditional means of livelihood, reduced the area \nof lands on which they depended, and caused pollution that in some cases \nendangered the health and welfare of indigenous communities.  Local NGOs \nagree d these findings remained  valid  during the year.  \n \nIn May  the president of the Social Care Pastoral Committee of the Catholic \nChurch , Bishop Jorge Lozano , expressed  concern  over the marginalization of \nindigenous populations throughout the country as  exemplified by rates of extreme \npoverty, illiteracy , and illness.  His concerns focused on the Qom community in \nFormosa Province , and  he placed responsib ility on the federal and provincial \ngovernments.  \n \nIn May policemen killed a Toba  community  member  in Chaco P rovince after a \nviolent eviction.  Representative s of the Qom Community  blame d the Chaco  vice \ngovernor , Juan Carlos Bacileff Ivanoff , who allegedly  ordered the eviction.  \n \nAdditionally , Abelardo D iaz, son of Qom chief  Felix D iaz, was the victim of a \nviolent attack by a group of 30 individuals.  Other members of D iaz\u2019 family \nsuffered systematic attacks during the year, which local analysts and NGOs  ARGENTINA 22 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  attributed to  Diaz\u2019 repeated demands for formal ownership of  Qom land .  Formosa  \nprovinc ial authorities minimized the importance of the attack s. \n \nA land survey , initiated by the federal government in 2011 , continued during the \nyear.   Various NGOs,  national deputies , and the Catholic Church claimed the \nNational Institute for Indigenous Rights , the entity charged with surveying land,  \nhad mapped only 12 percent  of the  entire  territory despite  funding sufficient to \nmake greater  progress.  \n \nSocietal Abuses, Discrimination, and Acts of Violence Based on Sexual \nOrientation and Gender Identity  \n \nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organizations operated freely .  They \nworked closely with academic institutions, NGOs, and government authorities without interference.  \n There was no official discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, \nhousing, statelessness, or access to education or health care .  Overt societal \ndiscrimination generally was uncommon,  but the National Institute Against \nDiscrimination, Xenophobia, and Racism reported cases of discrimination and \npolice brutality toward the transgender community .  In August a transsexual \nprisoner at Ezeiza Penitentiary reported serious mistreatment by prisoners and \npenitentiary officials, which two  witnesses  later confirmed .  After the  witnesses \nprovided their testimonies, prison guards injured the m and confined them to \nisolation and a psychiatric area.  \n \nIn April Pedro Robledo was the victim of a violent hate crime at a university party \nin Buenos Aires .  Robledo met with the university president and petitioned for the \namendment of the antidiscrimination law to include an article on sexual minorities.  \n \nOther Societal Violence or Discrimination  \n \nThere were no known reports of societal violence against persons with HIV/AIDs, \nbut there were occasional reports of discrimination against persons with the disease .  For example, the president of the Argentine Network for People with \nAIDS reported obstacles for  infected  individuals to obtain employment .  According \nto the president, medical checkups that diagnose the disease prevent approximately  \n60 to78 percent  of individuals from being hired.   \n \nSection 7. Worker Rights   ARGENTINA 23 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor   \na. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining  \n \nWith some restric tions, the law provides for  the right of all workers to form and \njoin \u201cfree and democratic labor unions, recognized by inscription in a special register,\u201d conduct legal strikes, and bargain collectively .  The law prohibits \nmilitary and law enforcement personnel from forming and joining unions.  The law \nprohibits discrimination against unions and protects workers from dismissal, \nsuspension, and changes in labor conditions .  The law provides for reinstatement \nfor workers fired for union activity.  \n \nThe law all ows unions to register without prior authorization, and registered trade \nunion organizations may engage in certain activities to represent their members, \nincluding petitioning the government and employers.  T he law grants official trade \nunion status to only one union deemed the \u201cmost representative\u201d per industrial sector within a specific geographical region.  Only unions with such official \nrecognition receive trade union immunity for their officials, are permitted to deduct \nunion dues directly, and may bargain collectively  with recourse to conciliation and \narbitration .  The most representative union bargains on behalf of all workers, and \ncollective agreements cover both union members and nonmembers in the sector .  \nThe law requires the Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security to ratify collective bargaining agreements.  \n \nThe Argentine Workers Central (CTA) and other labor groups not affiliated with \nthe General Confederation of Labor continued to contend that the legal recognition \nof only one union  per sector conflicted with international standards and prevented \nthese unions from obtaining full legal standing.   In June the  Supreme Court \ndecided a case  reaffirming the need for more than one official union per sector  and \nfor amendments to  the legislat ion.  Congress had not modified labor legislation, \nhowever, and the executive branch had not granted such recognition to the CTA by \nthe end of November . \n Civil servants and workers in essential services may strike only after a compulsory 15-day conciliation process, and they are subject to the condition that unspecified \n\u201cminimum services\u201d be rendered .  Once the conciliation term expires, civil \nservants and workers in essential services must give five days\u2019 notice to the \nadministrative authority and the public agency that they intend to strike .  If \n\u201cminimum services\u201d were  not previously defined in a collective bargaining \nagreement, all parties then negotiate which minimum services will continue to be  ARGENTINA 24 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  provided and a schedule for their provision .  The public agency, in turn, must \nprovide clients two days\u2019 notice of the impending strike.  \n \nThe government effectively enforced these laws.   Under the law complaints for \nunfair labor practices can be brought before the judiciary.  They may result in a \nfine being imposed on the employer, or the relevant employers' association where \nappropriate.   There were few cases of significant delays or appeals in the collective \nbargaining process.   \n \nWorkers exercised freedom of association and employers respected the right to \ncollectively bargain and to strike .  Labor  organizations operated independently  of \ngovernment and political parties.  \n \nb. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor  \n \nThe law prohibits all forms of forced or compulsory labor, and the government generally enforced such laws.   Penalties for violations range from four to 15 years \nin prison and are comparable to other serious offens es.  The Ministry of Security \nand the National Program of Rescue and Accompaniment of Victims under the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights reported rescuing 284 potential victims of \nforced labor from January through June .  The labor ministry carried out several \ninspections during the year and found various irregularities and potential cases of forced labor.  H olding perpetrators ac countable and providing victims with \nservices continued to be a problem .  \n \nForced labor occurred.   Employers subjected a  significant number of Bolivians, \nParaguayans, and Peruvians, as well as Argentine citizens from poorer northern provinces , to forced la bor in sweatshops, agriculture, and domestic work.   Men, \nwomen, and children (see section 7.c.)  were all victims of forced labor , although  \nvictims\u2019 gender and age varied by employment sector.  \n \nIn June the Airport Security Police detained a Colombian citizen on charges of leading an international forced-labor network .  The police identified more than 202 \nColombians recruited through misleading job offers who were potential victims of \nforced labor.  \n \nIn September police agents arrested 10 individuals allegedly participating in an \ninternational labor -trafficking network.  The network offered attractive jobs in \nArgentina to Chinese citizens, who travelled to Buenos Aires via Paraguay.    ARGENTINA 25 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  Traffickers sold the victims to Chinese supermarkets,  where they work ed more \nthan 12 hours a day in deplorable conditions . \n \nAlso see the Department of State\u2019s Trafficking in Persons Report  \nat www.state.gov/j/tip . \n \nc. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment  \n \nThe minimum age for employment is 16.   In rare cases labor authorities  may \nauthorize a younger child to work as part of a family unit.  Children between the \nages of 16 and 18 may work in a limited number of job categories and for limited hours if they have com pleted compulsory schooling, which normally ends at age \n18.  Children under 18 cannot be hired to perform perilous, arduous, or unhealthy \njobs.  The law requires employers to provide adequate care for workers\u2019 children \nduring work hours to discourage child labor.   \n Provincial governments and the city government of Buenos Aires are responsible \nfor labor law enforcement.  Legal penalties for employing underage workers range \nfrom 1,000 to 5,000 pesos ($200 to $1,000) for each child employed.   Subsequent \nviolat ions may lead the labor authority to close the company for up to 10 days, and \nthe company is then prevented from becoming a vendor to the government for a \nyear.   On March 20, the Senate unanimously passed a law punishing child labor \nwith penalties ranging from one to four years \u2019 imprisonment, unless the crime falls \nunder a more serious category.  The law excludes  parents.   These penalties are \nsufficient to deter violations.  \n While the government enforced applicable laws, observers  noted that inspectors \noften were well connected to the subjects of inspection and that corruption \nremain ed an obstacle to compliance, especially in the provinces.   \n \nChild labor occurred .  According to a 2004 government survey, an estimated \n450,000 children work ed, amounting to 7 percent of children between the ages of \nfive and 13 and 20 percent of children over the age of 14.  Employing preliminary \ndata from the corresponding 2012 survey, the Ministry of Labor  reported a 66 \npercent  decline in  child labor rate s between  2004  and 2012 .  In rural areas children \nworked on family and third- party farms producing such goods as blueberries, \ncotton, garlic, grapes, olives, strawberries, tobacco, tomatoes, and yerba mate.  Children working in the agriculture sector often handled pesticides without proper \nprotection.   In urban areas some children engaged in domestic service and worked \non the street selling goods, shining shoes, and recycling trash.  According to  ARGENTINA 26 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  government sources, some children worked in the manufacturing sector producing \nsuch goods as bricks, matches, fireworks, and garments.   Children also worked in \nthe mining, fishing, and construction sectors.   Officials noted reports of children  \nforced to work  as street vendors and beggars in the capital.   Commercial sexual \nexploitation of children occurred as well (see section 6, C hildren).  \n Also see the Department of Labor\u2019s Findings on the Worst Forms of Child \nLabor  at www.dol.gov/ilab/program s/ocft/tda.htm\n. \n \nd. Acceptable Conditions of Work  \n \nIn August the government increased the monthly minimum wage for most workers \nto 3,300  pesos ($660) .  The National Census and Statistics Institute estimated a \nfamily of four needed 1,708 pesos ($342) t o remain above the poverty line.  \n \nFederal law sets standards in the areas of health, safety, and hours.   The maximum \nworkday is eight hours, and the maximum workweek is 48 hours.   Overtime pay is \nrequired for hours worked in excess of these limits.  The law  sets minimums for \nperiods of rest, requiring a minimum of 12 hours of rest prior to the start of a new \nworkday.   Sundays are holidays, and those required to work on Sundays are paid \ndouble.   Labor law mandates  a minimum of 14 days and a maximum of 35 days of \npaid vacation, depending on the length of the  worker\u2019s  service.  \n \nThe law sets premium pay for overtime, adding an extra 50 percent of the hourly \nrate on ordinary days and 100 percent on Saturday afternoons, Sundays, and \nholidays.   Employees cannot be forced to work overtime unless work stoppage \nwould risk or cause injury, the need for overtime is caused by an act of God, or  \nother exceptional reasons affecting the national economy or \u201cunusual and \nunpredictable situations\u201d affecting businesses occur.  \n The law requires employers to insure their employees against accidents at the workplace and when traveling to and from work.   The law requires that employers \neither provide insurance through a labor risk insurance entity or provide its own \ninsurance to employees to meet specified requirements set forth by the national insurance regulator.   In October 2012 Congress amended the Labor Risks Law to \nincrease compensation for workers\u2019 death or incapacity, while limiting the \nworkers\u2019 entitlement to file a complaint if the workers accept the insurance \ncompany\u2019s compensation.  \n  ARGENTINA 27 \nCountry Reports on Human  Rights Practices for 2013  \nUnited States Department of State \u2022 Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor  In March Congress unanimously approved an amendment to the domestic \nemployee law that  expands workers\u2019 rights and benefits to d omestic employees, \nrural workers, freelance wor kers, and the volunteer firemen corps.  \n \nLaws governing acceptable conditions of work were not enforced universally, \nparticularly for workers in the informal sector.  The Ministry of Labor, Education, \nand Social Security has responsibility for enforcing leg islation related to working \nconditions.   The ministry continued inspections to ensure  companies register ed \ntheir informal workers.
