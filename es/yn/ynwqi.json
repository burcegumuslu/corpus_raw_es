Post-excavation conf irmation sampling (laboratory analysis) will consist of one 5-po int composite \nsample per Residential yard area removed, six 5-point composite s per trash mound, and four 5-point composites for the Drainage Ditch. \nEach residential property will require $3,000 to replace landscaping. \nEach residential property will require 100 linear feet of either fencing or cinder block wall to be removed and replaced after remediation.\n \n500070APPENDIX III \u2013 ADMINISTRATIVE \nRECORD INDEX \nOperable Unit 2 \nOperable Unit 1 \n500071          \n \n \n                                                                                      \n        \n   \n     \n    \n \n \n \n     \n \n     \n \n             \n                \n                                                                             \n              \n                    \n \n      \n                \n               \n                        \n                 \n                \n                      \n \n               \n                      \n                   \n               \n \n           \n                  \n                        \n                \n                     \n  \n             \n                  \n                                \n                       \n                  \n   \n VEGA BAJA SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL SUPERFUND SITE\n \nOPERABLE UNIT TWO\n \nADMINISTRATIVE RECORD FILE\n \nINDEX OF DOCUMENTS\n \n3.0 REMEDIAL INVESTIGATION\n \n3.3 Work Plans\n \nP. 300001 \u2013 Report: Quality Assurance Project Plan Addendum ,\n \n300131 Vega Baja Solid Waste Superfund Site, Operable \nUnit 2: Soils, Revision #1, prepared by Golder \nDOC ID #108446 Associates Inc., prepared for Vega Baja \nCooperating PRP Group, August 2004. \n3.4 Remedial Investigation Reports\n \nP.\t 300132 \u2013 Report: Vega Baja Solid Waste Superfund Site ,\n \n300250 Operable Unit 2: Soils, Vega Baja, Puerto Rico ,\n \nTechnical Memorandum: Data Evaluation Report ,\n \nDOC ID #108447\t prepared by Golder Associates Inc., prepared for\n \nVega Baja Cooperating PRP Group, March 2005.\n \nP.\t 300251 \u2013 Report: Vega Baja Solid Waste Superfund Site ,\n \n300300 Operable Unit 2, Pathway Analysis Report ,\n \nprepared by Golder Associates Inc., prepared for\n \nDOC ID #108448 Vega Baja Cooperating PRP Group, May 2005.\n \nP.\t 300301 \u2013 Report: Remedial Investigation Report, Operable\n \n300592 Unit 2: Soils, Vega Baja Solid Waste Superfund\n \nSite, Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, Revision 1 , prepared\n \nDOC ID #108449\t by Golder Associates Inc., prepared for Vega Baja\n \nCooperating PRP Group, July 2008.\n \nP.\t 300593 \u2013 Report: Final Baseline Human Health Risk\n \n301282 Assessment, Vega Baja Solid Waste Superfund Site ,\n \nOperable Unit 2 , prepared by Golder Associates\n \nDOC ID #108450\t Inc., prepared for Vega Baja Cooperating PRP\n \nGroup, July 2009.\n \n500072\n*109645*\n109645 \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n    \n                 P. \t301283 \u2013 Report: Final Screening Level Ecological Risk301461 Assessment, Vega Baja Solid Waste Superfund Site,\nVega Baja, Puerto Rico, prepared by Golder\nDOC ID #108451\t  Associates Inc., prepared for Vega Baja\nCooperating PRP Group, December 2009. \n4.0 FEASIBILITY STUDY \n4.3 Feasibility Study Reports \nP. \t400001 \u2013 Report: Remedial Alternatives Screening\n400039 Memorandum, Vega Baja Solid Waste Superfund Site,\nOperable Unit 2, Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, prepared\nDOC ID #108452\t  by Golder Associates Inc., prepared for Vega Baja\nCooperating PRP Group, December 2009. \n4.6 Correspondence \nP. \t400040 \u2013 Letter to Ms. Nancy Rodriguez, P.E., Remedial\n400040 Project Manager, Chief, Enforcement & Superfund\nBranch, Caribbean Environmental Protection\nDOC ID #108453\t  Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,\nRegion 2, from Mr. Andrew P.

Alternatives have been developed to address contaminated soils. \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA\u2019s) \nPreferred Alternative to address soil contamination is Alternative 2, Removal with On-Site Consolidation and Cover in the Non-Residential Area. This remedy will \nalso include Institutional Controls to address certain uncharacterized areas beneath buildings and pavements and to prevent the disturbance of soil covers. A groundwater investigation was conducted at the site as part of the Operable Unit 1 (OU-1) Remedial Investigation (RI). This i nvestigation concluded that \ngroundwater has not been impacted by site-related contaminants. A No Action Record of Decision (ROD) for OU-1 was signed in April 2004. \nThis Proposed Plan includes summaries of all the \ncleanup alternatives evaluated for the site. This document is issued by EPA, the lead agency for site activities, and the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board (PREQB), the support agency. EPA, in consultation with PREQB, will select the final remedy for lead-contaminated soils after reviewing and considering all informati on submitted during a 30-day \npublic comment period.  EPA, in consultation with PREQB, may modify the preferred alternative or select another response action presented in this Proposed Plan based on new information or public comments. Therefore, the public is encouraged to review and comment on all the alternatives presented in this document. \nEPA is issuing this Proposed Plan as part of its \ncommunity relations program under Section 117(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, commonly known as Superfund).  This Proposed Plan summarizes information that can be found in greater detail in the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) reports and other documents contained in the Administrative Record (AR) for the site.

The site includes a 55-acre residential area known as Comunidad Brisas del Rosario, containing 213 dwellings and a 17-acre undeve loped, uninhabited area. \nThe Vega Baja Site is situated on relatively flat terrain and is surrounded by residential areas to the north, east and west. To the south, the site is bordered by conical limestone hills known as mogotes. Four \u201ctrash mounds,\u201d believed to contain trash associated with the former solid waste disposal operations as well as native soils, rocks and boulders, were present within the residential area of the site and were up to 10 feet in height. \nSITE HISTORY \nFrom 1948 to 1979, the municipality of Vega Baja offered \nand used the site as an unlin ed solid waste disposal and \nopen burning facility for commercial, industrial and domestic wastes. An estimated 1.1 million cubic yards of waste were either disposed of or burned at the facility. In the late 1970s, local residents began constructing homes on sections of the uncapped waste disposal area. Two hundred and thirteen houses were built on top of the landfill and soil contaminated with lead, arsenic and pesticides. \nBased upon historical aerial photographs, disposal \nactivities were largely concentrated in the southwestern portion of the now developed area, and in the northern portion of the undeveloped area of the site. During the period of disposal, the site was owned by the Puerto Rico Land Authority. In 1984, the Puerto Rico Land Authority attempted to transfer approximately 55 acres of the property to the Puerto Rico Housing Department. The Puerto Rico Housing Department has subsequently attempted to give deeds to several residents; however, it is not clear in the records which residents hold deeds to their properties, if any. The other portions of the site remain under the ownership of the Puerto Rico Housing Department or the Puerto Rico Land Authority. \nPrevious Environmental Investigations \nVarious environmental investigations and removal actions \nhave been conducted at the site since 1994 under the direction of the EPA and the PREQB. These activities are summarized below. \n1994 \u2013 Site Inspection \nThe EQB conducted a Site Inspection in May 1994 that \nconsisted of the collection of five surface soil samples from five residential properties, one background soil sample, five sediment samples from the site drainage ditch and the Rio Indio, and two groundwater samples from upgradient and downgradient municipal wells. \n1996 \u2013 Expanded Site Inspection \nThe EQB and EPA\u2019s Superfund Technical Assistance and \nResponse Team (START) conducted an expanded Site Inspection between June a nd August 1996 that consisted \nof the collection of surface soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater samples. Surface soil samples were collected from residences and analyzed for lead using on\u00adsite X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and confirmatory laboratory analysis of 153 samples for Target Compound List (TCL) and Target Analyte List (TAL) parameters. A total of six sediment and five surface water samples were collected from the drainage ditch and the Rio Indio and \n2\n \n500108  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n analyzed for TCL and TAL parameters. Groundwater \nsamples were collected from upgradient and downgradient water supply wells. \n1998 \u2013 Limited Groundwater Study \nSTART conducted a groundwater investigation between \nApril and June 1998 that included the installation and sampling of three groundwater monitoring wells (depths ranged from 195 to 215 feet below ground surface) and seven water supply wells. Samples were analyzed for TCL and TAL parameters. \n1998 \u2013 Phase I, II and III Soil Sampling \nThe EPA conducted three phases of soil sampling \nactivities between April and December 1998 that included the collection of 3,693 surface soil samples. Phase I samples were collected throughout the residential area, the undeveloped area in the southern area of the site and along the drainage ditch. A total of 814 samples were analyzed for lead using XRF, and ten percent of the samples were sent to a laboratory for confirmatory analysis. The confirmatory samples were also analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), base-neutral acids (BNAs), pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Phase II included the collection of 2,823 soil samples from 213 residences, which were analyzed for lead using XRF. A total of 283 samples were sent to a laboratory for confirmatory lead analysis. At residences where lead concentrations were equal to or greater than 400 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), biased sampling was conducted based on previous sampling results, and samples were taken at the ground surface, and 1- and 2-foot depths. At residences where previous lead concentrations were found to be below 400 mg/kg, either surface soil samples were taken on a regular grid or samples were taken at 1-foot depths. Phase III consisted of the collection of 56 soil samples from the trash mounds, which were analyzed for lead using XRF techniques. Ten percent of these samples were also sent to a laboratory for confirmatory analysis. \n1998 ATSDR Blood Lead Testing \nThe Agency of Toxic Substances and Disease Registry \n(ATSDR) and Puerto Rico Department of Health conducted a blood lead study of children who lived at the site. None of the blood lead levels in the children (blood was analyzed from all preschool-aged children at the site) exceeded the Center for Disease Control and Prevention action level of 10 micrograms per deciliter (ug/dL - the maximum measured concentration was 8.4 ug/dL). \n1999 \u2013 NPL Listing \nThe site was included on the National Priorities List \n(NPL) in July 1999 based on a Hazard Ranking System (HRS) Evaluation conducted in February 1999. The main contaminants identified were lead and arsenic in residential surface soil samples. \n2001 \u2013 Dioxin Sampling \nEPA\u2019s Response Engineering and Analytical Contract \n(REAC) Team collected 10 surface soil samples for dioxin analysis. Based on the results, it was concluded by EPA that dioxins were not a contaminant of concern. \n1999 to 2001 \u2013 EPA Removal Action \nEPA conducted removal acti ons at two residential \nproperties, 5569 Alturas Street and 5460 Los Angeles \nStreet, and at 5571 Alturas Street where a church building is located. Lead-contaminated soils and trash were removed and disposed off-s ite between October 1999 and \nSeptember 2001. \n1999 to 2004 \u2013 OU-1 Groundwater Investigation \nCDM Federal Programs initiated the Remedial \nInvestigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for Groundwater (OU-1) on behalf of EPA in September 1999. The OU-1 RI included an ecological survey, the installation of seven monitoring wells, and sampling of groundwater, surface water, sediment, soil, and springs/seeps. Based on the results of the investigation, EPA issued a Record of Decision in April 2004 selecting no further action for groundwater. \n2003 Consent Order \nIn April 2003, EPA completed its negotiation with the \nidentified Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) and signed a Consent Order in which the PRP agreed to conduct a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study for Operable Unit 2 (OU2) Soils. EPA identified as PRPs the following entities: Municipality of Vega Baja (operator), Puerto Rico Housing Department (owner), Puerto Rico Land Authority (owner), Motorola (generator), Pfizer (generator), Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (generator), and Browning-Ferris Industries of Puerto Rico (transporter). \n2004 PRPs Removal Action \nIn March 2004, EPA advised the PRPs that an \nunauthorized disturbance had occurred at the site involving the removal of a portion of one of the Trash Mounds on a residential property at 5782 Los Ortiz and disturbance of soils on adjacent properties. Materials that had been removed had been placed in the adjoining non\u00adresidential portion of the site. EPA and the PRPs conducted site inspections, which indicated that the remainder of the Trash Mound (located at 5565 Alturas Street) had been left in a physically unstable condition. The PRPs also collect ed samples to assess lead \nconcentrations in the disturbed soil and to determine whether the waste involved was characteristically hazardous. At EPA's request, the PRPs developed a plan \n3\n \n500109  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n to respond to the unauthorized disturbance. Following \nEPA approval, the PRPs implemented the plan in July 2004, including the removal of the unstable remaining portion of the Trash Mound at 5565 Alturas. Both areas were restored by placement of a geotextile barrier and one foot of clean soil, which was revegetated. Removed materials were consolidated with those that had been relocated as part of the unauthorized disturbance, and also covered with a geotextile  barrier and one foot of \nclean soil and revegetated. Waste testing confirmed that the materials involved were non-hazardous. \nSITE CHARACTERISTICS \nThe majority of the residential area of the site is covered \nby densely spaced residences, asphalt roadways and other paved areas. The non-residential area of the site (southwestern portion) is highly vegetated and is \nundeveloped. The southern boundary of the site is \ncharacterized by the presence of limestone mogotes that reach elevations of approximately 120 feet and feature near-vertical rock faces and caves. A multi-lane highway, Route 22, is located to the north. \nThere are no surface water features on the site other than \na drainage ditch that runs west-east through the site parallel to Alturas Street and discharges to the Rio Indio located approximately two-thirds of a mile to the east. Based on field observations, the ditch is dry except during storm events or when manmade discharges occur (such as a sewer overflow experienced during the OU-2 field investigation). The Rio Indio flows into the Rio Cibuco which flows north to the coast of the island eventually draining into the Atlantic Ocean. \nThe unconsolidated materials at the site represent only a \nthin layer (generally two to four feet thick) which is underlain by Aymam\u00f3n Limestone bedrock. The soils include mostly dark grayish-brown clay or silt and reddish- and yellowish-brown clay.  Soils in historic disposal areas sometimes contain waste such as broken glass and rusted metal. The mogotes located in the southern portion of the site are outcroppings of the Aymam\u00f3n formation; the Aymam\u00f3n formation is approximately 200 feet thick below the site. Groundwater is not encountered until 200 feet below the ground surface. \nThe majority of the surrounding land is residential with \nan estimated population within a \u00bc-mile radius of the site of 2,280 people and an estimated population within one mile of 6,871 people. Th e U.S. Census 2000 website \nreported an average persons per household of 3.07 for Vega Baja. If applicable to households at the site, this average would result in an estimated population of 657 people living in homes on the site. Some of the residents grow small quantities of edible food crops such as avocados, coconuts, lemons, oranges, and plantains. \nSoil Investigations- OU2 Sampling Program \nThe scope of the OU-2 RI Field Investigation was defined \nin the Final Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) Addendum and the results were presented in the Final RI Report. The RI included the following sampling programs: \n\ufffd Residential sampling: to determine the \nconcentrations of lead in soil, indoor dust, and tap water, \nand the concentrations of target analyte list (TAL) metals, target compound list (TCL) pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) Aroclors in soil, for baseline risk assessment purposes. \n\ufffd Non-Residential Area sampling: to delineate the \nextent of the lead-contaminated area and to collect further \ndata on the levels of PCBs and pesticides in the soil for baseline risk assessment purposes. \n\ufffd Trash Mound Area sampling: to determine the \nconcentrations of TAL metals, TCL pesticides, and PCB \nAroclors in soil, for b aseline risk assessment purposes. \n\ufffd Background sampling: to determine background \nlevels of TAL metals and TCL pesticides. \nResidential Lead \nAs described in the RI Report,  lead sampling performed at \nthe site prior to the RI primarily consisted of collection of \ndata based on XRF field testing. The residential lead sampling program in the RI included 55 areas spread across 35 properties where concentrations of lead in soil greater than 400 mg/kg had been detected during previous sampling events.  Five-point composite samples were collected at three depth inte rvals (0-1 inch, 1-12 inches, \nand from 12 inches to bedrock) in each of the areas (except at 5576 Alturas where bedrock was encountered at less than one foot). Access was not obtained at two properties, therefore, only 33 properties and 49 areas were sampled.  A total of 146 soil samples were collected for lead analysis and submitted, under chain-of-custody, to the laboratory for analysis.  Of the 33 properties sampled for lead in soil, 31 were also sampled for household dust and 30 for tap water. \nResidential Blocks \nPre-RI soil sampling in the Residential Area (for \ncompounds other than lead) included collection of surface soil samples at 16 locations that were analyzed for TAL metals (28 samples), TCL pesticides (26 samples), and \n4\n \n500110 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n                \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n PCB Aroclors (26 samples).  The RI included the \ncollection of 46 additional surface soil samples from the Residential Area for TAL metals, TCL pesticides, and PCBs analyses. The goal of the RI sampling event was to collect sufficient additional samples to calculate reliable 95% upper confidence limits on the mean soil concentrations. During the RI, 46 samples were collected from the 0- to 1-foot depth range (or bedrock, whichever was shallower) and analyzed for TAL metals and TCL pesticides. A total of 28 RI samples were also analyzed for PCB Aroclors. Additionally, one confirmatory PCB sample was collected to determine whether a previously detected \u201chot spot\u201d of PCB contamination was actually present. This confirmatory sample indicated that PCBs were not elevated above screening levels at that location. \nNon-Residential Area \nPre-RI sampling conducted in the Non-Residential, \nwooded area in the southern portion of the site included the collection of 25 samples (from 10 locations) that were analyzed for TAL metals, and 16 samples (from 7 locations) that were analyzed for TCL pesticides and PCBs. Previous investigations also included extensive lead analyses using field XRF and showed lead contamination above screening levels across the majority of this area. Additional sampling was conducted in the Non-Residential Area during the RI to delineate the extent of elevated lead concentrations in soil (above 400 mg/kg) and to gather data for the baseline risk assessment.  Soil lead concentrations were field screened using a portable XRF. Screening samples were collected along transects extending outward from the boundaries of previous sampling until either a concentration less than 400 mg/kg was measured using the XRF instrument, or until the vertical rock face of the mogote physically limited the potential waste disposal area.  A total of 13 samples, taken where the XRF instrument detected concentrations of lead below 400 mg/kg or a vertical rock outcrop was encountered, were sent for laboratory confirmation analysis. Three samples collected in the Non-Residential Area were also analyzed for TCL pesticides and PCB Aroclors. \nTrash Mounds \nPre-RI sampling conducted in the Trash Mounds \nincluded the collection of 11 samples (from four locations) that were analyzed for TAL metals, TCL pesticides and PCBs. One of the Trash Mounds (Trash Mound #1) was subsequently removed and six additional \nsamples were collected in the three remaining Trash Mounds during the RI to support the development of the baseline risk assessment.  Specifically, two RI samples were collected from within each of the existing Trash Mounds at a depth of 0 to 2 feet below ground surface (bgs). The samples were analyzed for TAL Metals, TCL pesticides, and PCB Aroclors. Background \nTen off-site areas that were not affected by site disposal \nactivities were sampled during the RI to assess background conditions. Two samples were collected in each background area and analyzed for TAL metals, TCL pesticides and PCB Aroclors. Samples were collected to a depth of 2 feet or bedrock, whichever was shallower. Nine of the ten areas did not appear to have been disturbed by anthropogenic activities.  The other area was located within a baseball field, and the soil samples were noticeably sandier, perhaps reflecting the import of fill for \ngrading/vegetation growth. \nWHAT IS A \"PRINCIPAL THREAT\"? \nThe NCP establishes an expectation that EPA will use \ntreatment to address the principal threats posed by a site \nwherever practicable (NCP Section 300.430(a)(1)(iii)(A)).  The \"principal threat\" concept is applied to the characterization of \"source materials\" at a Superfund site.  A source material is \nmaterial that includes or c ontains hazardous substances, \npollutants or contaminants that act as a reservoir for migration \nof contamination to ground water, surface water or air, or acts as a source for direct exposur e.  Contaminated ground water \ngenerally is not considered to  be a source material; however, \nNon-Aqueous Phase Liquids (NAPLs) in ground water may be viewed as source material.  Principal threat wastes are those source materials considered to be highly toxic or highly mobile that generally cannot be reliably contained, or would present a significant risk to human hea lth or the environment should \nexposure occur. The decision to treat these wastes is made on a site-specific basis through a detailed analysis of the alternatives using the nine remedy selection criteria  This analysis provides a basis for making a statutory finding that the remedy employs treatment as a principal element.  \nResults of the Soils Investigations \nThe following metals were detected in soil at the site at \nconcentrations above EPA risk-based screening levels: lead, arsenic, chromium, copper (in three samples which were collected from a Trash Mound and from the Non-Residential Area), iron, manganese, thallium, and zinc (in one sample collected from a Trash Mound during the pre-RI study). As presented in the Final RI report, statistical and graphical comparisons of background arsenic, chromium, and manganese levels with site concentrations \nshow that potential risks from these contaminants at the site are not significantly different than those presented by exposure to background concentrations. The only organic compound detected at concentrations above screening levels was the pesticide dieldrin (in four samples, two of which were in Trash Mounds). \nThere were 16 surface soil samples above the 400 mg/kg \nlead screening level, representing 10 separate properties. All 10 properties with sample results higher than 400 \n5\n \n500111  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n mg/kg within the surface soil were also above 400 mg/kg \nin the 1-inch to 12-inch samples.  An additional 8 properties had sample results higher than 400 mg/kg in the 1 to 12- inch interval but were below the screening value in the surface soil.  There was one property where a sample deeper than one foot was above the screening value, but all shallower samples on that property were below the screening value.  Overall, out of the 33 properties where RI soil samples were collected for lead analysis, 19 had sample results higher than 400 mg/kg within at least one sampling interval.     \nThe extent of lead contamination above the screening \nlevel of 400 mg/kg in the Non-Residential Area of the site was delineated during the RI and is bounded by the near-vertical rock face of the southern mogotes. Approximately 8.5 acres of the Non-Residential Area are above the lead screening value of 400 mg/kg with multiple locations where lead has been detected at \nconcentrations above 1,000 mg/kg.  Similarly, the nature and extent of contamination within the existing Trash Mounds at the site have been characterized. All six Trash Mound samples collected were above the screening levels for lead, arsenic, thallium, and iron. \nFor this site, there are two properties with elevated \nindoor dust concentrations of lead: 5570 Alturas (824 mg/kg lead in dust) and 5376 Santa Maria (624 mg/kg lead in dust).  Potential remedial technologies were evaluated to address indoor dust. \nDuring EPA\u2019s OU-1 investigation, two rounds of soil \nsamples were collected from seven locations in the \ndrainage ditch that runs thr ough the Site parallel to Calle \nAlturas. Three of the ditch sample locations are located on-site and lead was detected in these samples at concentrations up to 1,180 mg/kg.  \nSCOPE AND ROLE OF THE ACTION \nEPA is addressing the cleanup of this site by \nimplementing remedial actions to address soil contamination.  The cleanup of the site, which is the subject of this Proposed Plan, will provide for implementation of a remedy to address soil contaminants in both the residential (including trash mounds and the drainage ditch) and unde veloped (also known as non\u00ad\nresidential) areas. \nSUMMARY OF SITE RISKS \nRISK SUMMARY \nThe purpose of the risk assessment is to identify \npotential cancer risks and non-cancer health hazards at the site assuming that no further remedial action is taken. This Proposed Plan presents the results of the baseline \nhuman health risk assessment and screening-level ecological risk assessment for exposure to soil.  \nAs part of the RI/FS, EPA conducted a baseline risk \nassessment to estimate the current and future effects of contaminants on human health and the environment. A baseline risk assessment is an analysis of the potential adverse human health and ecological effects of releases of hazardous substances from a site in the absence of any actions or controls to mitigate such releases, under current and future land uses. The baseline risk assessment includes a human health risk assessment (HHRA) and an ecological risk assessment. These reports can be found in the Administrative Record. \nHuman Health Risk Assessment \nA four-step human health risk assessment process was \nused for assessing site-related cancer risks and noncancer health hazards. The four-step process is comprised of: Hazard Identification of Chemicals of Potential Concern (COPCs), Exposure Assessment, Toxicity Assessment, and Risk Characterization (see adjoining box \u201cWhat is Risk and How is it Calculated\u201d). \nThe baseline risk assessment began by selecting COPCs in \nthe soil which could potentially cause adverse health effects in exposure populations. These populations included current and future residents and intermittent adolescent visitors to the site who may be exposed to contaminants through incidental ingestion of soil, dermal contact with soil and inhalation of airborne dust for current residents of the site. In addition, potential current exposures to contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) from the ingestion of homegrown vegetables were also considered for current residents at the site. Future exposure scenarios expanded the scope to include incidental ingestion of soil, dermal contact with soil, and inhalation of airborne dust by future construction and industrial workers at the site.  Standard EPA exposure modeling and risk calculation procedures were used to estimate potential risk from exposure to all analytes other than lead. For lead, the EPA\u2019s Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model for Lead in Children (IEUBK) and Adult Lead Model (ALM) were used to evaluate the potential risk from exposure to lead. \nPotential risks were estimated for the various areas of the \nsite (Residential, Non-Resi dential, Trash Mounds, and \nDrainage Ditch) based on the analytical data collected during both RI and pre-RI studies. Site-specific parameters were utilized in the assessment where available (e.g., site-specific dust and tap water sampling results were used in the IEUBK mode l) to reduce the uncertainty \nthat results from using generic, default assumptions. \n6\n \n500112 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Based on current reasonable maximum exposure (RME) \nassumptions, the excess lifetime cancer risk estimated for adult residents is 4.4 x 10-5 and for child residents is 7.5 x 10-5. For future RME assumptions, the comparable estimated risks for adult and child residents are 5.2 x 10-5 and 9.5 x 10-5, respectively.  Non-cancer hazard indices exceeding EPA\u2019s threshold value of 1.0 were also calculated for child residents under current and future RME and central tendency (CT) exposure assumptions, due primarily to arsenic and thallium.  In addition, the non-cancer hazard index was above EPA\u2019s non-cancer threshold of 1.0 for future construction worker exposure via inhalation of dust contaminated with manganese. Two of the three metals that were identified as posing potential increases in cancer risk or non-cancer hazards, arsenic and manganese, were identified as being at concentrations that are similar to background concentrations (Golder, 2008 and 2009a). \nBased upon the determination of concentrations being similar to background, these compounds do not warrant a remedial action.  The reference dose associated with thallium was recently withdrawn by the EPA due to uncertainty in the development of the value; therefore, the non-cancer hazard that w as associated with thallium \nexposure was removed from the risk assessment.  If new information becomes available, the consideration of thallium as a COC could be re-evaluated either during the Remedial Design or Five-Year Review to ensure that concentrations of thallium in the soil are protective. \nSite-related risks from potential exposure to lead at the \nsite were also estimated in the HHRA.  Based on modeling results (IEUBK and ALM), several residential properties, the Drainage Ditch, the Trash Mounds, and the Non-Residential Area were identified as having the potential to cause an increase in blood lead (i.e., greater than 5% of the population exceeding 10 ug/dL of lead in the blood) to residents living on the site. Based on the potential for increased blood lead concentrations in residents at the site, it was determined that a remedial action was warranted to reduce the potential exposures from lead at the site.  \nScreening Level Ecological Risk Assessment \nA Screening Level Ecological Risk Assessment \n(SLERA) was conducted to evaluate potential risks to ecological receptors at the site. The SLERA followed a two-step approach consisting of a problem formulation and ecological effects evaluation step and an exposure estimate and risk calculation step.  The risk calculation consisted of calculating a hazard quotient (HQ) for each compound by comparing the detected concentrations in the soil samples or modeled dietary intake of contaminants with appropriate toxicity reference values (TRVs) for representative ecological receptors. Food web risk was evaluated for Antillean fruit bat, Red-legged thrush, Northern bobwhite, and Red-tailed hawk. The HQ approach for estimating risk is based on the ratio of a selected exposure concentration to a selected ecological screening level (ESL) or effects concentration. \nA HQ greater than 1.0 indicates that the potential exists \nfor adverse ecological effects to occur as a result of site\u00adrelated exposures.  Based on the first two steps, the SLERA identified 11 contaminants that could be related to adverse ecological effects in plants, invertebrates, mammals or birds that inhabit the site property.  These contaminants include aluminum, antimony, arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, thallium, vanadium, zinc, and 4.4\u2019-DDE  Each of these compounds was associated with a HQ greater than 1.0. \nThe next step that was followed was to refine the selection \nof contaminants of potential concern at the site, which is documented in the addendum to the SLERA referenced above. There were two basic modifications utilized: \n\ufffd Refinement of exposure point concentrations (i.e., \nconcentration in media) through the use 95% upper\u00ad\nconfidence limits instead of maximum detected concentrations, and \n\ufffd Consideration of background concentrations of \nmetals detected in the soil and background samples. Based on the results of the SLERA, risks to populations of \necological receptors, especially avian species represented in the risk assessment by the Red-legged thrush and Northern bobwhite, at the site were determined to be associated with exposure to lead at the site. Exposure to other compounds detected at the site were determined not to pose an unacceptable risk to ecological receptors, and \nthe compounds do not warrant a remedial action. Thus, protection of avian receptor populations from exposure to lead is identified as a remedial action objective. A cleanup \nvalue of 450 mg/kg was determined to be protective of avian populations that use the site. \nSummary \nIt is EPA\u2019s current judgment that the Preferred Alternative \nidentified in this Proposed Plan, or one of the other active measures considered, is necessary to protect public health, welfare and the environment from actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances, namely lead, into the environment. \n7\n \n500113  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n WHAT IS RISK AND HOW IS IT \nCALCULATED?\n \nA Superfund baseline human health risk assessment is an \nanalysis of the potential adver se health effects caused by \nhazardous substance releases fr om a site in the absence of \nany actions to control or mitigate these under current- and future-land uses. A four-step process is utilized for assessing site-related human health risks for reasonable maximum exposure scenarios. \nHazard Identification: In this step, the contaminants of \nconcern at the site in various media (i.e., soil, groundwater, \nsurface water, and air) are i dentified based on such factors \nas toxicity, frequency of occurrence, and fate and transport of the contaminants in the envir onment, concentrations of the \ncontaminants in specific media, mobility, persistence, and bioaccumulation. \nExposure Assessment:  In this step, the different exposure \npathways through which people might be exposed to the \ncontaminants identified in the previous step are evaluated. \nExamples of exposure pathway s include incidental ingestion \nof and dermal contact with contaminated soil.  Factors relating to the exposure assessment include, but are not limited to, the concentrations  that people might be exposed \nto and the potential frequency and duration of exposure. \nUsing these factors, a \u201cr easonable maximum exposure\u201d \nscenario, which portrays the hi ghest level of human exposure \nthat could reasonably be expected to occur, is calculated. \nToxicity Assessment: In this step, the types of adverse health \neffects associated with chemical exposures, and the relationship between magnit ude of exposure (dose) and \nseverity of adverse effects (response) are determined. Potential health effects ar e chemical-specific and may \ninclude the risk of developing canc er over a lifetime or other \nnon-cancer health effects, su ch as changes in the normal \nfunctions of organs within the body (e.g., changes in the effectiveness of the immune syst em).  Some chemicals are \ncapable of causing both c ancer and non-cancer health \neffects. \nRisk Characterization: This step summarizes and combines \nexposure information and toxicity assessments to provide a \nquantitative assessment of si te risks.  Exposures are \nevaluated based on the potential risk of developing cancer \nand the potential for non-canc er health hazards.  The \nlikelihood of an individual developi ng cancer is expressed as \na probability. For example, a 10\n-4 cancer risk means a \n\u201cone-in-ten-thousand excess canc er risk\u201d; or one additional \ncancer may be seen in a popul ation of 10,000 people as a \nresult of exposure to site contaminants under the conditions \nexplained in the Exposure A ssessment. Current Superfund \nguidelines for acceptable exposur es are an individual lifetime \nexcess cancer risk in the range of 10-4 to 10-6 \n(corresponding to a one-in-ten- thousand to a one-in-a-million \nexcess cancer risk). For non-cancer health effects, a \u201chazard index\u201d (HI) is calculated. An HI represents the sum of the individual exposure levels compared to their corresponding reference doses. The key concept  for a non-cancer HI is that \na \u201cthreshold level\u201d (measured as an HI of less than 1) exists \nbelow which non-cancer health effects are not expected to \noccur. REMEDIAL ACTION OBJECTIVES \nRemedial action objectives (RAOs) are specific goals to \nprotect human health and the environment. These objectives are based on available information and standards, such as applicable or relevant and appropriate \nrequirements (ARARs), to-be-considered guidance, and site-specific risk-based levels. \nThe following RAOs have been identified for lead \ncontaminated soils at the site: \n\uf0b7\t RAO-1: Prevent or minimize human exposure in the Residential Area (including the Drainage Ditch) to soil lead concentrations greater than the cleanup goal. \n\uf0b7 RAO-2: Eliminate potential exposure to the remaining Trash Mounds in the Residential Area. \n\uf0b7 RAO-3: Mitigate human exposure to lead in the Non-Residential Area above the cleanup goal. \n\uf0b7\t RAO-4: Protect populations of avian receptors from unacceptable exposure to lead by using a cleanup value of 450 mg/kg, which has been determined to be protective of ecological receptors, including avian populations, at the site. \nTo achieve these RAOs, a cleanup goal for soils at the site was identified. The results of the risk assessment (both Human Health and Ecological) indicated that the only contaminant for which a cleanup goal is necessary is lead. The Superfund Lead-Contaminated Residential Sites Handbook (EPA 2003) states \"Final cleanup level selection for Superfund sites generally is based on the IEUBK model results and the nine criteria analysis per the National Contingency Plan (NCP), which includes an analysis of ARARs.\u201d Based on these considerations, EPA has established a lead cleanup value of 450 mg/kg to be applied to all areas where removal is undertaken, including Residential Yards, Trash Mounds, the Drainage Ditch, and the Non-Residential Area. \nSUMMARY OF REMEDIAL ALTERNATIVES \nPotential remedial technologies and process options were \nidentified and screened using effectiveness, implementability and cost as the criteria, with the most emphasis on the effectiveness of the remedial technology. Those technologies that passed this initial screening were then assembled into five remedial alternatives for soil contamination.   \nThe time frames presented below for construction do not \ninclude the time for pre-design investigations, remedial design, or contract procurements.  Five-Year Reviews will be performed after the initiation of the remedial action, to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the remedy.    \n8 \n500114 \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Remedial Alternatives Common Elements \nEach alternative, other than No Further Action, includes \ncertain common elements that are discussed below. \nInstitutional Controls \nAll of the remedial alternatives, with the exception of the \nNo Further Action Alternative (Alternative 1) would include institutional controls such as deed and land use restrictions to minimize the public\u2019s potential exposure to contaminated soils.  However, consistent with expectations set out in S uperfund regulations, none of \nthe alternatives rely exclusively on institutional controls to achieve protectiveness. \nInstitutional controls are a common element to each of \nthe alternatives to address certain uncharacterized areas beneath buildings and pavements. In addition, institutional controls would be used to prevent the disturbance of soil covers (o ther than in accordance with \nappropriate engineering controls). \nInstitutional controls will apply as follows:  \n\ufffd Areas within Non-Residential Area where cover \nis used to contain contaminated materials will be subject to institutional controls. \ufffd For properties where soil removal is undertaken \nor has already been undertaken, institutional controls will apply to areas beneath buildings and pavement. \ufffd Paved areas and/or buildings immediately \nadjoining an area where soil removal is being undertaken will be subject to institutional controls. \ufffd Any area where final post-excavation sampling \nindicates lead concentrations above the cleanup goal will be subject to institutional controls. \ufffd Roadways adjacent to properties where soil \nremoval is being undertaken or has already been undertaken will be subject to institutional controls, likely \nvia the existing \u201cCall Before You Dig\u201d program. \nThe specific mechanisms for establishing institutional \ncontrols will be addressed as part of the remedial design phase. \nMore information about Institutional Controls can be \nfound at: \nhttp://www.epa.gov/fedfac/pdf/ic_ctzns_guide.pdf \nPre-Design Investigation (PDI) \nAdditional investigation will be required prior to \nRemedial Design.  The following activities will be included in a Pre-Design Investigation: \ufffd Detailed surveying of property features and \ntopography.  \ufffd Soil sampling at two properties where access could not be obtained during the OU-2 RI. \ufffd Additional soil sampling at eight properties where \nadditional lead concentration data are needed to support design. \ufffd Additional Drainage Ditch soil sampling for lead \nfor comparison to the cleanup goal. Where bedrock is exposed at the base of the Drainage Ditch, no samples will be collected. \ufffd Delineation and surveying of the horizontal extent \nand top elevations of existing Trash Mounds based on visual observations and the basemap survey. \nConstruction/Performance Monitoring \nEach remedial alternative described below will include \ncertain construction and/or performance monitoring activities to ensure the effectiveness of the remedy.  For example, during remedial actions that involve removal (excavation) of soil, post-excavation sampling may be necessary to determine whether the excavation meets the remedial goals. Post-excavation sampling will be performed when soil remains in place after excavation (i.e., sampling will not be performed if the excavation is advanced to bedrock). In addition, air monitoring will likely be required during construction to ensure protection of workers and nearby residents.  Performance monitoring including cover inspections and maintenance will be required to confirm long-term effectiveness. \nIndoor Dust Monitoring and Management Program \nThe management of risks related to lead in indoor dust \nwill be the same for all remedial alternatives (other than No Further Action) and will consist of the following: \ufffd Engineering controls during remedial activities \nsuch that migration of lead in fugitive dust into homes is minimized. \ufffd Post-remediation confirmation sampling three \nmonths after completion of the selected remedy at the two properties where elevated levels of indoor dust lead were measured in the OU2 RI. \ufffd If confirmation sampling indicates that indoor \ndust lead concentrations are at or below acceptable concentrations (based on IEUBK modeling using post\u00adremedial surface soil concentrations), then no further action is necessary. \ufffd If confirmation sampling indicates that indoor \ndust lead concentrations are above acceptable concentrations (based on IEUBK modeling using post\u00adremedial surface soil concentrations), indoor dust removal will be performed, unless a non-site-related source of lead is identified as the cause. \nOff-Site Disposal Option \nSome materials (e.g., large/bulky debris, putrescent \nmaterials, etc.) in the Trash Mounds or Non-Residential Area may prove to be unsuitable for on-site treatment or consolidation, so each altern ative includes an option to \n9\n \n500115  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  dispose of some portion of the contaminated materials \noff-site. It is anticipated that the Trash Mounds primarily contain large boulders, soil, and small inert debris items (e.g., broken glass, small pieces of metal, etc.).  These materials can be consolidated and covered in the Non-Residential Area. Materials that are unsuitable for consolidation will be disposed of or recycled at an off-site facility.  Any materials to be sent off-site for disposal will be screened for possible off-site recycling (as opposed to landfill disposal) where appropriate; such materials would be decontaminated prior to recycling as necessary.  Materials sent off-site for disposal will be classified, based on hazardous characteristics, prior to disposal. The approach for implementing this option will be further detailed in the Remedial Design. \nSurface Water Management and Erosion Control \nThe remediation of the site will result in surface \nearthwork construction since the active alternatives involve soil disturbance. A surface water management plan will be developed during remedial design to provide \nfor the effective control of surface water runoff and to minimize soil erosion from covered areas.  The surface water management and erosion control system will consist of the following components: \ufffd A grading plan that maintains existing grades \nwhere feasible and integrates final surface topography in the remediated areas with the surrounding areas. \ufffd The use of slopes, berms, channels, and surface \narmoring using natural vege tation and/or synthetic \nmaterials (e.g., silt fence) to convey surface water runoff in the Non-Residential Area and to provide erosion protection. \nBecause the existing drainage ditch parallel to Alturas \nStreet currently provides the primary drainage pathway for surface water runoff at the site, the surface water management plan is likely to tie into the ditch; however, the specifics of the surface water management system will be developed during detailed design and will \ncomply with Puerto Rico soil erosion and sedimentation control requirements. \nAccess Agreements \nAccess agreement will be obtained from private property \nowners where remedial activities are planned. Access agreements may also be sought on properties located adjacent to areas where remedial activities will be conducted. For example, access may be needed to properties adjacent to Trash M ounds in the event that the \ndisposal area is found to extend onto those properties during removal.   \nAccess to the Drainage Ditch will also be needed for the \nPDI sampling, and possibly for the remedial action. Because the Drainage Ditch is associated with the roadway right-of-way, formal access agreements may not be needed from all residences that border the ditch. However, notification will be given to owners of \nproperties along the ditch in advance of sampling and remediation activities. \nEPA Region 2 Clean and Green Policy \nConsistent with EPA Region II\u2019s \u201cClean and Green\u201d \nPolicy, the utilization of applicable green remediation practices will be considered and, to the extent practical, will be incorporated into the detailed design of the remedial alternative.  Some examples of operational practices that would be applicable are those that reduce emissions of air pollutants, minimize fresh water consumption, incorporate native vegetation into revegetation plans, and consid er beneficial reuse and/or \nrecycling of materials, among others.   \nRemedial Alternatives \nAlternative 1 \u2013 No Further Action \nThe No Further Action Alternative was retained, as \nrequired by the National Contingency Plan (NCP), and provides a baseline for comparison with other alternatives. No remedial actions would be implemented as part of the No Further Action Alternative. Although no direct action would be taken, there may be natural processes (e.g., erosion/dispersion, sequestration, etc.) that would reduce the bioavailable concentrations of contaminants over time. At this site, the natural processes that would reduce bioavailable concentrations are not expected to achieve acceptable levels within a reasonable timeframe (i.e., >30 years). \nTotal Capital Cost \nOperation and Maintenance Total Present Net Worth $0 Estimated Construction Time frame $0 \n$0 \n0 years \nAlternative No. 2 \u2013 Removal with On-Site \nConsolidation and Cover in the Non-Residential Area \nThis alternative involves the removal of contaminated \nsoils located in the Residential Area, Drainage Ditch, and three Trash Mounds, and covering of the contaminated soils with clean soil in the Non-Residential Area. Excavated/removed materials would be consolidated in the Non-Residential Area prior to installation of the cover system in that area. The final design of the cover system in \nthe Non-Residential Area will be determined during detailed design, but it is anticipated that it will include a non-woven geotextile overlain by 12 inches of clean soil.  The soil cover will be vegetated to prevent erosion that would cause exposure to underlying materials.  All residential yards where excavation occurs would be backfilled and re-vegetated to restore pre-excavation conditions. \n10\n \n500116  \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n Total Capital Cost $4,350,000 \nOperation and Maintenance $20,000/yr \nTotal Present Net Worth $4,680,000 \nEstimated Construction Time frame < 1 year \nAlternative No. 3 \u2013 Removal with Off-Site Disposal \nAlternative 3 involves removing contaminated soil from \nthe Residential Area, the Drainage Ditch, the three Trash Mounds, the Non-Residential Area and disposing of the removed materials off-site in a non-hazardous waste landfill. All excavated areas would be backfilled and revegetated to existing grade with the exception of the Trash Mounds and any elevated mounds within the Non-Residential Area, which will be restored to the grade of surrounding areas. \nTotal Capital Cost $23,440,000 \nOperation and Maintenance $0 \nTotal Present Net Worth $23,440,000 \nEstimated Construction Time frame < 1 year \nAlternative No. 4 \u2013 Removal with On-Site Ex-Situ \nStabilization and Cover in the Non-Residential Area  \nAlternative 4 is similar to Alternative 2 in that it includes \nexcavating contaminated soils from the Residential Area (followed by backfilling with clean soil), Trash Mounds, Drainage Ditch and relocating these in the Non-Residential Area. However, unlike Alternative 2, Alternative 4 includes treatment of soil using ex-situ Solidification/Stabilization (S/S). Soils would be consolidated in the Non-Residential Area, treatment additives would be mixed into the consolidated materials, and then the mixture would be left to react. Following treatment, the stabilized materials would resemble a weak concrete.   Stabilized materials from the Residential Area, Trash Mounds, and Drainage Ditch will be combined with stabilized Non-Residential Area materials and placed in the Non-Residential Area and covered using the same cover system described for Alternatives 2. Prior to implementation of this \nalternative, both bench-scale (laboratory) studies and an on-site pilot study would be  required to confirm the \neffectiveness of the treatment and to determine appropriate amendments and gather data to support the detailed design. \nTotal Capital Cost $25,420,000 \nOperation and Maintenance $20,000/yr \nTotal Present Net Worth $25,820,000 \nEstimated Construction Time frame <1 year \nEVALUATION OF REMEDIAL ALTERNATIVES \nNine criteria are used to evaluate the different remedial \nalternatives individually and against each other in order to select the best alternative.   This section of the Proposed \nPlan profiles the relative performance of each alternative \nTHE NINE SUPERFUND EVALUATION \nCRITERIA \n1. Overall Protectiveness of Human Health and the \nEnvironment  evaluates whether and how an alternative \neliminates, reduces, or contro ls threats to public health and \nthe environment through instit utional controls, engineering \ncontrols, or treatment. \n2. Compliance with Applicable or Relevant and \nAppropriate Requirements (ARARs)  evaluates whether the \nalternative meets federal and state environment al statutes, \nregulations, and other requirements that pertain to the site, or \nwhether a waiver is justified. \n3. Long-term Effectiveness and Permanence  considers \nthe ability of an alternative to maintain protection of human \nhealth and the environment over time. \n4. Reduction of Toxicity, M obility, or Volume (TMV) of \nContaminants through Treatment  evaluates an \nalternative's use of treatment to  reduce the harmful effects of \nprincipal contaminants, thei r ability to move in the \nenvironment, and the amount of contamination present. 5. Short-term Effectiveness considers the length of time \nneeded to implement an alte rnative and the risks the \nalternative poses to work ers, the community, and the \nenvironment during implementation. \n6. Implementability  considers the technical and \nadministrative feasib ility of implementing the alternative, \nincluding factors such as the relative availability of goods and \nservices. \n7. Cost  includes estimated capital and annual operations \nand maintenance costs, as well as present worth cost. \nPresent worth cost is the total co st of an alternative over time \nin terms of today's dollar value.   Cost estimates are expected \nto be accurate within a range of +50 to -30 percent. 8. State/Support Agency Acceptance  considers whether \nthe State agrees with  the EPA's analyses and \nrecommendations, as described in the RI/FS and Proposed \nPlan. \n9. Community Acceptance  considers whether the local \ncommunity agrees with EPA's analyses and preferred \nalternative. Comments rece ived on the Proposed Plan are an \nimportant indicator of community acceptance. \nagainst the nine criteria, noting how it compares to the \nother options under consideration.  The evaluation of the alternatives in relation to the nine criteria are discussed below. A more detailed analysis of the presented alternatives can be found in the Feasibility Study report. \nOverall Protection of Human Health and the \nEnvironment \n11\n \n500117  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n Alternative 1 does not provide for protection of human \nhealth and the environment since there are current and future risks that would not be addressed by that alternative. Since Alternative 1 does not achieve this threshold criterion, it will not be discussed further in the Comparative Evaluation. \nThe other three alternatives can all achieve protection of \nhuman health and the environment. \nCompliance with Applicable or Relevant and \nAppropriate Requirements (ARARs) \nAll four alternatives are expected to be able to comply \nwith applicable action, and location-specific ARARs. \nLong-Term Effectiveness and Permanence \nSince lead cannot be destroyed, the remedial alternatives \nare designed to mitigate risk by minimizing potential exposure.  Alternative 3 eliminates risk by permanently removing accessible contaminants from the site, and employs institutional and engineering controls for materials not currently exposed. Alternative 4 eliminates risk by relocating, fixating, then containing accessible contaminants, and employs institutional and engineering controls for materials not currently exposed and the containment area. Alternative 2 eliminates risk solely by relocating and containing accessible contaminants at the site, and employs institutiona l and engineering controls \nfor materials not currently exposed and the containment area. For all alternatives, the institutional and engineering controls to be employed for the currently inaccessible areas are expected to be reliable in the long term, and five-year reviews will be performed. Alternative 3 achieves the highest level of long-term effectiveness and permanence since long-term operations and maintenance would not be required at the site to mitigate risk for currently accessible soils. Although the inherent hazard of the lead remains under the cap for Alternatives 2 and 4, the cap is expected to effectively eliminate the exposure pathway, effectively eliminating the associated risk. Since th e potential for cap failure, \nhowever small, would exist, the long-term effectiveness of Alternatives 2 and 4 would not be as reliable as Alternative 3. Further, in the event of cap failure, Alternative 4 would pose less risk than Alternative 2 until the cap was replaced/repaired, as the contaminants would be less mobile.   \nReduction of Toxicity, Mobility, or Volume Through \nTreatment \nOnly Alternative 4 provides treatment of lead\u00ad\ncontaminated soils and, therefore, was ranked highest. S/S treatment of lead-contaminated materials will reduce the toxicity (by reducing bioavailability) and mobility of lead. \nShort-Term Effectiveness \nShort-term adverse impacts associated with the \nalternatives are caused primarily by operation of construction equipment during excavation, transportation, \ntreatment, and other construction activities.  Alternative 2 will have the lowest level of short-term impacts since it involves less transportation of impacted materials compared to Alternative 3 and it does not involve the addition of additives and mixing that are required by Alternative 4. Alternative 3 is expected to have the most significant short-term impacts since numerous truck loads of impacted soil will need to be transported for off-site disposal through the neighboring community. \nImplementability \nIn general, all three alternatives are implementable since \nthe technologies and skills are readily available. Alternative 2 is considered the easiest to implement since \nit does not require additional testing and does not involve off-site transport of materials. Off-site disposal involves issues associated to materials determined to be hazardous \nbecause there are no disposal f acilities in Puerto Rico that \ncould accept such materials without pre-treatment to remove the hazardous characteristic.   \nCost \nAlternative 2 is expected to have the lowest \nimplementation cost since it does not involve off-site disposal or stabilization/solidification treatment. Alternative 3 will have a higher cost than Alternative 2 due to the need for off-site transportation and disposal. Alternative 4 is expected to have the highest cost due to the need for stabilization/solidification treatment of all excavated materials, includi ng the impacted soil in the \nNon-Residential Area. Alternatives 2 and 4 include similar long-term O&M costs, but Alternative 3 does not require a long-term O&M component. \nState/Support Agency Acceptance \nThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico agrees with the \npreferred alternative in this Proposed Plan. \nCommunity Acceptance \nCommunity acceptance of the preferred alternative will be \nevaluated after the public comment period ends and will be described in the Responsiveness Summary section of the Record of Decision for this site. The Record of Decision is the document that formalizes the selection of \n12\n \n500118 \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n the remedy for a site. \nSUMMARY OF THE PREFERRED \nALTERNATIVE \nAlternative 2, Removal with On-Site Consolidation and \nCover in the Non-Residential Area, is the preferred remedial alternative for soil contamination at this site.   \nThis alternative provides for removal of lead-\ncontaminated soils in the Residential Area yards and the Drainage Ditch where lead concentrations are above the site cleanup goal of 450 mg/ kg, and removal of Trash \nMound materials. Removed materials would be transported to the Non-Residential Area and consolidated. All residential yards where excavation is conducted would be backfilled and re-vegetated to restore pre-excavation conditions.  Approximately 8.5 acres of the Non-Residential Area where soil lead concentrations are above th e site cleanup goal and/or \ntrash mound materials are present would then be covered with a soil cover system.  Confirmation sampling would be conducted after removal of materials to confirm that the cleanup goal has been achieved at the target depth. Air monitoring will be requi red during construction to \nensure the protection of workers and nearby residents. An option is included for materials that are not conducive to consolidation and cover (i.e., large debris) to be sent off-site for disposal or recycling.  Any materials to be sent off-site for disposal will be screened for possible recycling (as opposed to landfill disposal) where appropriate; such materials would be decontaminated prior to recycling as necessary. Materials sent off-site for disposal will be classified, based on hazardous characteristics, prior to disposal. The approach for implementing this option will be further detailed in the Remedial Design. \nThe final design of the cover system in the Non-\nResidential Area will be determined during detailed design, but it is anticipated that it will include a non\u00adwoven geotextile overlain by 12 inches of clean soil.       The soil cover will be vegetated to prevent erosion that would cause exposure to underlying materials. Although the future use of the Non-Residential Area has not yet been determined, institutional controls will be established to preclude residential use of the soil cover area to ensure the cover will be protective. A routine inspection and maintenance program will specifically provide for identification of adverse impacts from severe weather events. The monitoring program would be designed to include both scheduled, routine inspections (e.g., annually), as well as periodic event-driven inspections during the initial establishment of a vegetative cover (e.g., inspections immediately following extreme rainfall events within the first year after cover installation).  Performance monitoring will be performed to confirm long-term effectiveness. \nThis alternative will include institutional controls to \naddress certain uncharacterized areas beneath buildings and pavements.  In addition,  institutional controls would \nbe established to prevent the disturbance of soil covers. \nThe management of risks related to lead in indoor dust \nwill include engineering controls during remedial activities such that migration of lead in fugitive dust into homes is minimized, post-remediation confirmation sampling three months after completion of the selected remedy at the two properties where elevated levels of indoor dust lead were measured in the OU-2 RI. \nAdditional investigation will be required prior to \nRemedial Design including detailed surveying of property features and topography, soil sampling at two properties where access could not be obtained during the OU-2 RI, additional soil sampling at eight properties where further lead concentration data are needed to support design, and additional Drainage Ditch soil sampling for lead for comparison to the cleanup goal.  \nThe remediation of the site will result in surface earthwork \nconstruction since the selected alternative involves soil disturbance. A surface water management plan will be developed during remedial design to provide for the effective control of surface water runoff and to minimize soil erosion from covered areas. The surface water management and erosion control system will consist of the following components: \ufffd A grading plan that maintains existing grades \nwhere feasible and integrates final surface topography in the remediated areas with the surrounding areas. \ufffd The use of slopes, berms, channels, and surface \narmoring using natural vege tation and/or synthetic \nmaterials (e.g., silt fence) to convey surface water runoff in the Non-Residential Area and to provide erosion protection. \nBecause the existing drainage ditch parallel to Alturas \nStreet currently provides the primary drainage pathway for surface water runoff at the site, the surface water management plan is likely to tie into the ditch; however, the specifics of the surface water management system will be developed during detailed design and will comply with \nPuerto Rico soil erosion and sedimentation control requirements. \nAccess agreements will be obtained from private property \nowners. In addition, access agreements will also be sought on properties located adjacent to areas where remedial activities will be conducted.   \n13\n \n500119  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Access to the Drainage Ditch will also be needed for the \nPDI sampling, and possibly for the remedial action. Because the Drainage Ditch is associated with the roadway right-of-way, formal access agreements may not be needed from all residences that border the ditch. However, notification will be given to those residents who live along the ditch in advance of sampling and remediation activities. \nConsistent with EPA Region 2\u2019s Clean and Green \npolicy, EPA will evaluate and seek to employ sustainable technologies and practices with respect to this alternative. \nAs is EPA\u2019s policy, Five-Year Reviews will be \nconducted to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the selected remedy.   \nCOMMUNITY PARTICIPATION \nEPA provided information regarding the cleanup of the \nVega Baja Solid Waste Disposal Superfund Site to the public through public meetings, the Administrative Record file for the site and announcements published in the Primera Hora and Vocero newspapers. EPA encourages the public to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the site and the Superfund activities that have been conducted there. \nFor further information on the site including EPA\u2019s \npreferred alternative for the Vega Baja Solid Waste Disposal Superfund Site, contact: \nNancy Rodriguez Brenda Reyes \nRemedial Project Manager Community Relations \n(787) 977-5887 (787) 977-5869 \nUS EPA Caribbean Environmental Protection Division \nCentro Europa Building \n1492 Ponce de Leon Avenue, Suite 417 \nSan Juan, Puerto Rico 00908 \n(787) 977-5865 \nOr access EPA web page at: \nhttp://www.epa.gov/region02/superfund/npl/vegabaja \nThe dates for the public comment period; the date, the location and time of the public meeting; and the locations of the Administrative Record files are provided on the front page of this Proposed Plan. \n500120\n14   \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n    \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n GLOSSARY \nARARs:  Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate \nRequirements. These are Federal or State environmental rules \nand regulations that may pertain to the site or a particular alternative.  \nCarcinogenic Risk:  Cancer risks are expressed as a number \nreflecting the increased chance that a person will develop \ncancer if exposed to chemicals or substances. For example, EPA\u2019s acceptable risk range for Superfund hazardous waste \nsites is 1 x 10\n-4 to 1 x 10-6, meaning there is 1 additional \nchance in 10,000 (1 x 10-4) to 1 additional chance in 1 million \n(1 x 10-6) that a person will develop cancer if exposed to a Site \ncontaminant that is not remediated.  \nCERCLA: Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation and Liability Act. A Federal law, commonly referred to as the \u201cSuperfund\u201d Program, passed in 1980 that provides for response actions at sites found to be contaminated with hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants that endanger public health and safety or the environment. \nCOPC:  Chemical of Potential Concern. \nSLERA: Screening Level Ecological Risk Assessment.

A value equal to or less than one indicates that the human population is not likely to experience adverse effects. \nHQ: Hazard Quotient. HQs are used to evaluate non\u00ad\ncarcinogenic health effects and ecological risks. A value equal \nto or less than one indicates that the human or ecological \npopulation is not likely to experience adverse effects.  \nICs: Institutional Controls. Admini strative methods to prevent \nhuman exposure to contaminants, such as by restricting the \nuse of groundwater for drinking water purposes.  \nIEUBK: The Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model is \na mathmatical model that predicts the blood lead concentration \nin humans due to exposure to lead in air, food, water, dust, and soil.  The model can also be used to develop cleanup goals for lead that are pr otective of public health. \nNine Evaluation Criteria: See text box on Page 7.  \nNon-carcinogenic Risk:  Non-cancer Hazards (or risk) are \nexpressed as a quotient that compares the existing level of \nexposure to the acceptable level of exposure. There is a level of exposure (the reference dose) below which it is unlikely for even a sensitive population to experience adverse health effects. EPA\u2019s threshold level for non-carcinogenic risk at Superfund sites is 1.0, meaning that if the exposure exceeds the threshold; there may be a concern for potential non-cancer effects. \nNPL: National Priorities List.

El Lugar incluye una zona residencial de 55 acres conocida como Comunidad Brisas del Rosario, con 213 viviendas y un \u00e1rea de 17 hect\u00e1reas sin desarrollar y deshabitada. El Lugar de Vega Baja se encuentra en un terreno relativamente plano y est\u00e1 rodeado por zonas residenciales al norte, este y oeste. Al sur, el Lugar est\u00e1 rodeado por colinas de piedra caliza conocida como mogotes c\u00f3nicos. Cuatro \"mont\u00edculos de basura,\" que se cree que contienen la basura asociada a la antigua operaci\u00f3n del Lugar, as\u00ed como los suelos  nativos, rocas y grandes piedras, se encontraban en la zona residencial del Lugar con hasta 10 pies de altura. TRASFONDO DEL LUGAR \nDesde 1948 a 1979, el municipio de Vega Baja ofrec\u00eda y \nutilizaba el Lugar como deposito de desperdicios s\u00f3lidos y quema al aire libre de desperdicios comerciales, industriales y dom\u00e9sticos. Se eliminaba o quemaba un estimado de 1.1 millones de yardas c\u00fabicas de desperdicios s\u00f3lidos en el Lugar. A finales de 1970, residentes locales comenzaron a construir casas en las secciones de la zona de de disposici\u00f3n de desperdicios. Se construyeron doscientos trece casas en la parte superior del relleno sanitario y tierra contaminada con plomo, ars\u00e9nico y pesticidas. \nBasado en fotograf\u00edas a\u00e9reas hist\u00f3ricas, la disposici\u00f3n de \ndesperdicios s\u00f3lidos se concen traba principalmente en la \nporci\u00f3n suroeste del \u00e1rea ahora desarrollada, y en la porci\u00f3n norte del \u00e1rea subdesarrollada del Lugar. Durante el per\u00edodo de disposici\u00f3n, el Lugar era propiedad de la Autoridad de Tierras de Puerto Rico. En 1984, la Autoridad de Tierras de Puerto Rico intent\u00f3 transferir aproximadamente 55 acres de la propiedad al Departamento de Vivienda de Puerto Rico. El Departamento de Vivienda de Puerto Rico posteriormente ha intentado otorgar t\u00edtulos de propiedad a los residentes; sin embargo, no est\u00e1 claro en los registros que residentes tienen t\u00edtulos de propiedad, si alguno. Las otras partes del Lugar permanecen bajo la propiedad del Departamento de Vivienda de Puerto Rico o de la Autoridad de Tierras de Puerto Rico. \nINVESTIGACIONES AMBIENTALES PREVIAS \nSe han llevado a cabo diversas investigaciones ambientales \ny acciones de remoci\u00f3n en el Lugar desde 1994, bajo la direcci\u00f3n de la EPA y la JCA. Estas actividades est\u00e1n explicadas en detalle en el R\u00e9cord Administrativo del Lugar. \nPROGRAMA DE MUESTREO DURANTE LAS \nINVESTIGACI\u00d3N DEL SUELO-OU2 \nEl \u00e1mbito de la OU-2 de RI Investigaci\u00f3n de Campo se \ndefini\u00f3 en el documento Final del Plan Propuesto de Calidad (QAPP) y los resultados se presentaron en el Informe Final de RI. El mismo incluy\u00f3 los programas de muestreo siguientes: \n\ufffd Muestreo Residencial: para determinar las \nconcentraciones de plomo en el suelo, polvo dom\u00e9stico, y \nel agua de la pluma, y las concentraciones de la lista de analitos (TAL) de metales, lista de compuestos (TCL) pesticidas y bifenilos policlorados (PCB) o Aroclors en el suelo, para fines de referenc ia de evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos. \n\ufffd Muestreo de \u00e1reas no residenciales: para delinear la \n2\n \n500127  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n extensi\u00f3n del \u00e1rea contaminada con plomo y para \nrecoger m\u00e1s datos sobre los niveles de PCB y plaguicidas en el suelo con fines de referencia de evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos. \n\ufffd Muestreo del \u00e1rea de Mont\u00edculos de Basura: para \ndeterminar las concentraciones de metales TAL, pesticidas TCL, y Aroclors PCB en el suelo, con fines de referencia de evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos. \n\ufffd Muestreo de Trasfondo: para determinar los niveles de \ntrasfondo de metales y plaguicidas TAL y TCL. \nLos resultados de las investigaciones de Suelos \nLos siguientes metales se detectaron en el suelo del \nLugar en concentraciones por encima de los niveles de detecci\u00f3n de la EPA basados en el riesgo: plomo, ars\u00e9nico, cromo, cobre (en tres muestras que se recogieron de un mont\u00edculo de basura y del \u00e1rea no residencial), hierro manganeso, talio y zinc (en una muestra recogida de un mont\u00edculo de basura durante el estudio de Pre-RI). Como se indica en el Informe Final de RI, comparaciones estad\u00edsticas y gr\u00e1ficas de trasfondo de ars\u00e9nico, cromo, manganeso y los niveles con las concentraciones del Lugar muestran que los riesgos potenciales de estos contaminantes en el Lugar  no son significativamente diferentes a las presentadas por la exposici\u00f3n a concentraciones de trasfondo. El \u00fanico compuesto org\u00e1nico detectado con concentraciones superiores a los niveles de evaluaci\u00f3n fue el plaguicidas dieldr\u00edn (en cuatro muestras, dos de los cuales se encontraban en los mont\u00edculos de basura).   \nEn las propiedades residenciales hubo muestras de suelo \ncon resultados por encima de los 400 mg/kg del nivel de detecci\u00f3n de plomo.  \nEl grado de contaminaci\u00f3n por plomo por encima del \nnivel de detecci\u00f3n de 400 mg/kg en la zona no residencial del Lugar fue delineado durante el RI y est\u00e1 delimitada por la pared de roca casi vertical de los mogotes del sur. Aproximadamente 8.5 cuerdas de la zona no residencial est\u00e1n por encima del valor de un examen de plomo de 400 mg/kg, con m\u00faltiples lugares donde el plomo ha sido detectado en concentraciones superiores a 1,000 mg/kg. Del mismo modo, se han caracterizado la naturaleza y el alcance de la contaminaci\u00f3n dentro de los mont\u00edculos de basura presentes en el lugar. Todas las seis muestras de mont\u00edculo de basura recolectadas fueron superiores a los niveles de detecci\u00f3n de plomo, ars\u00e9nico, talio, y hierro. \nPara esta Lugar, hay dos propiedades con elevadas \nconcentraciones de polvo de plomo dom\u00e9stico.  Como parte del proceso se evalu\u00f3 el potencial de las tecnolog\u00edas correctivas para atender las concentraciones elevadas en el polvo dom\u00e9stico. \nDurante la investigaci\u00f3n EPA OU-1, dos rondas de \nmuestras de suelo  fueron recolectadas en siete localidades de la Zanja de Drenaje que corre paralela a la Calle Alturas del Lugar. Tres de los puntos de muestreo de la zanja se encuentran en el Lugar y se detect\u00f3 plomo en las muestras en concentraciones de hasta 1,180 mg/kg. \nRESUMEN DE LOS RIESGOS DE EL LUGAR \nEl prop\u00f3sito de la evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos es identificar los \nriesgos potenciales de c\u00e1ncer y no cancer\u00edgenos en el Lugar, presumiendo que no se tome ninguna otra medida correctiva. El Plan Propuesto presenta los resultados de la evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgo para la salud humana y la evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgo ecol\u00f3gico. \nComo parte de la RI/FS, la EPA llev\u00f3 a cabo una \nevaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos de referencia para estimar los efectos actuales y futuros de los contaminantes sobre la salud humana y el medio ambiente. Una evaluaci\u00f3n del riesgo inicial es un an\u00e1lisis del potencial nocivo para la salud humana y los efectos ecol\u00f3gicos de las emisiones de sustancias peligrosas en un lugar a falta de acciones o controles para mitigar dichas emisiones, en virtud de los usos actuales y futuros del lugar. La evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgo inicial incluye una evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos para la salud humana (HHRA) y una evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgo ecol\u00f3gico. Estos informes se pueden encontrar en el Record Administrativo. \nDESARROLLO DE LA ACCION CORRECTIVA \nEPA esta atendiendo la contaminaci\u00f3n de suelo existente \nen el Lugar mediante la selecci\u00f3n de una alternativa de limpieza que sirve de acci\u00f3n correctiva para solucionar la contaminaci\u00f3n del suelo.  La limpieza de el Lugar incluye la aplicaci\u00f3n de un remedio que atender\u00e1 los contaminantes del suelo, tanto en la zona residencial (incluidos los mont\u00edculos de basura y la Zanja de Drenaje) como en el \u00e1rea no desarrollada (tambi\u00e9n conocido como \u00e1rea no residencial). \nOBJETIVOS DE ACCI\u00d3N CORRECTIVA \nLos objetivos de acci\u00f3n correctiva (RAOS) son las metas \nespec\u00edficas para proteger la salud humana y el medio ambiente. Estos objetivos se basan en la informaci\u00f3n disponible y las normas, tales como requisitos apropiados aplicables o relevantes (ARAR), orientaci\u00f3n a ser consideradas, y los niveles en funci\u00f3n de los riesgos espec\u00edficos del Lugar. \n3\n \n500128  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  Los siguientes RAOS se han definido para los suelos \ncontaminados de plomo en el Lugar: \n\u2022 RAO-1: Prevenir o reducir al m\u00ednimo la exposici\u00f3n \nhumana en la Zona Residencial (incluyendo la Zanja de Drenaje) para concentraciones de plomo del suelo mayor que la meta de limpieza. \n\u2022 RAO-2: Eliminar la exposici\u00f3n potencial al resto \nde los Mont\u00edculos de Basura en la zona residencial. \n\u2022 RAO-3: Mitigar la exposici\u00f3n humana al plomo en \nla Zona no Residencial por encima de la meta de limpieza. \n\u2022 RAO-4: Proteger los receptores de poblaci\u00f3n aviar \nde una exposici\u00f3n inaceptable al plomo usando un valor de limpieza de 450 mg/kg que se determino es protector de los receptores ecol\u00f3gicos, incluyendo la poblaci\u00f3n aviar en el Lugar.  \nPara alcanzar estos RAO, se identific\u00f3 un objetivo de limpieza para suelos en el Lugar. Los resultados de la evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos (tanto la salud humana como la ecol\u00f3gica) indicaron que el \u00fanico contaminante para el cual se necesita limpieza es plomo. El Folleto de Superfondo de Contaminaci\u00f3n de Lugares Residenciales (EPA 2003) establece que \"El nivel final de limpieza de los lugares de Superfondo en general se basa en los resultados del modelo IEUBK y los nueve criterios de an\u00e1lisis del Plan Nacional de  Contingencia (NCP), que \nincluye un an\u00e1lisis de los ARAR\". Basado en estas consideraciones, la EPA ha establecido un nivel de limpieza de plomo de 450 mg/kg que se aplicar\u00e1 a todas las \u00e1reas, cuando la remoci\u00f3n se lleve a cabo, incluyendo Patios o Areas Residenciales, los Mont\u00edculos de Basura, la Zanja de Drenaje, y la Zona No Residencial.  \nRESUMEN DE LA ALTERNATIVA PREFERIDA \nLa Alternativa 2, Remoci\u00f3n con Consolidaci\u00f3n en el \nLugar y Cubierta en la Zona No Residencial, es la alternativa de limpieza preferida para la contaminaci\u00f3n del suelo en este Lugar. \nEsta alternativa contempla la excavaci\u00f3n de suelos \ncontaminados con plomo en el \u00c1rea de Residencias y la Zanja de Drenaje donde las concentraciones de plomo est\u00e1n por encima de la meta de limpieza del Lugar de 450 mg/kg, y la remoci\u00f3n del material de los Mont\u00edculos de Basura. Los materiales extra\u00eddos se transportar\u00e1n a la zona no residencial y se consolidaran. Todos los patios residenciales donde se lleva a cabo la excavaci\u00f3n se rellenar\u00e1n y volver\u00e1n a sembrar para restablecer la condici\u00f3n anterior a la excavaci\u00f3n. Aproximadamente 8.5 cuerdas de la zona no residencial del suelo donde las concentraciones de plomo est\u00e1n por encima de la meta de limpieza del Lugar  y/o est\u00e1n presentes materiales de los mont\u00edculos de basura se  cubrir\u00e1n con un sistema de cubierta del suelo. Se llevar\u00e1 a cabo el muestreo de confirmaci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de la remoci\u00f3n de los materiales para confirmar que la meta de limpieza se ha alcanzado a la profundidad deseada. El monitoreo del aire ser\u00e1 necesario durante la construcci\u00f3n para garantizar la protecci\u00f3n de los trabajadores y residentes cercanos. Se incluye una opci\u00f3n para los materiales que no son conducentes a la consolidaci\u00f3n y la cubierta (es decir, residuos de grandes dimensiones) para ser enviadas fuera del Lugar para disposici\u00f3n o reciclaje. Cualquier material que se env\u00ede fuera del Lugar para su disposici\u00f3n se analizar\u00e1 para un posible reciclaje seg\u00fan sea apropiado; dichos materiales se descontaminar\u00e1n antes de su reciclaje cuando sea necesario. Los materiales enviados fuera del Lugar se clasificar\u00e1n, basados en las caracter\u00edsticas de peligro, antes de su remoci\u00f3n. El enfoque para la aplicaci\u00f3n de esta opci\u00f3n se mostrar\u00e1 con mayor detalle en el Dise\u00f1o de la Acci\u00f3n Correctiva. \nEl dise\u00f1o final del sistema de cubierta en la Zona No \nResidencial se determinar\u00e1 durante el dise\u00f1o detallado, pero se anticipa que va a incluir una capa de geotextil no\u00adtejido debajo de 12 pulgadas de tierra limpia. El suelo se cubrir\u00e1 de vegetaci\u00f3n para evita r la erosi\u00f3n que causar\u00eda la \nexposici\u00f3n a los materiales subyacentes. Aunque el uso futuro de la zona no r esidencial a\u00fan no ha sido \ndeterminado, se establecer\u00e1n controles institucionales  para evitar el uso residencial sobre la cubierta del suelo  en el \u00e1rea para asegurar que la cubierta dar\u00e1 protecci\u00f3n.

Adem\u00e1s, se establecer\u00e1n los controles institucionales para evitar que ocurran disturbios en la cubierta del suelo. \nEl manejo de los riesgos relacionados con plomo en el \npolvo dom\u00e9stico incluir\u00e1 controles de ingenier\u00eda durante las actividades remediativas para minimizar la migraci\u00f3n del plomo en el polvo fugitivo hacia los hogares, muestreo de confirmaci\u00f3n tres meses despu\u00e9s de completar el remedio seleccionado en las dos propiedades donde se midieron los niveles elevados de plomo en el polvo dom\u00e9stico en el OU-2 RI. \n4\n \n500129  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Se requerir\u00e1 una investigaci\u00f3n adicional antes del Dise\u00f1o \nde Acci\u00f3n Correctiva incluyendo la medici\u00f3n detallada de caracter\u00edsticas y la topograf\u00eda de la propiedad, el muestreo de suelos  a dos propiedades donde el acceso no se pudo obtener durante el RI de OU-2, muestreo adicional en ocho propiedades donde se necesita m\u00e1s datos sobre la concentraci\u00f3n de  plomo para el dise\u00f1o de \napoyo y de suelo, muestreo de la Zanja de Drenaje para plomo para la comparaci\u00f3n con el objetivo de limpieza. \nDado que la alternativa seleccionada envuelve la \nalteraci\u00f3n de suelo, se desarrollar\u00e1 un plan de manejo de las aguas superficiales durante el dise\u00f1o correctivo para establecer el control efectivo de la escorrent\u00eda superficial del agua y reducir al m\u00ednimo la erosi\u00f3n del suelo de las zonas cubiertas. El manejo del agua superficial y el sistema de control de la erosi\u00f3n consistir\u00e1 de los siguientes componentes: \n\ufffd Un plan de nivelaci\u00f3n que mantenga los grados \nexistentes siempre que sea viable y se integre la topograf\u00eda de la superficie final en las \u00e1reas remediadas con las \u00e1reas circundantes. \ufffd El uso de las pistas, bermas, canales, y la superficie usando vegetaci\u00f3n natural y/o de materiales sint\u00e9ticos (por ejemplo, cerca de limo) para transmitir el escurrimiento superficial del agua en la zona no residencial y para proporcionar protecci\u00f3n contra la erosi\u00f3n. \nDebido a que la Zanja de Drenaje paralela a la Calle \nAlturas en la actualidad proporciona la v\u00eda de drenaje principal para la escorrent\u00eda de las aguas superficiales en el Lugar, es probable que el plan de manejo del agua superficial est\u00e9 relacionados con la zanja, sin embargo, los detalles del sistema de manejo del agua de superficie, se desarrollar\u00e1n en el dise\u00f1o detallado y cumplir\u00e1 con la requisitos de erosi\u00f3n del suelo y los de sedimentaci\u00f3n en Puerto Rico. \nLos acuerdos de acceso se obtendr\u00e1n de los due\u00f1os de \nlas propiedades privadas. Ad em\u00e1s, tambi\u00e9n se buscar\u00e1n \nlos acuerdos de acceso en l as propiedades adyacentes a \nlas zonas donde las actividades de recuperaci\u00f3n se llevar\u00e1n a cabo. \nEl acceso a la Zanja de Drenaje tambi\u00e9n ser\u00e1 necesario \npara la toma de muestras PDI, y posiblemente para las medidas correctivas. Debido a que la Zanja de Drenaje se asocia con el derecho de paso, quiz\u00e1s no se necesiten los acuerdos formales de acceso de todas las residencias que bordean la zanja. Sin embargo, la notificaci\u00f3n se le dar\u00e1 a los residentes que viven a lo largo de la zanja antes de la toma de muestras y actividades correctivas. \nDe acuerdo con la pol\u00edtica de Limpieza Verde de la EPA Regi\u00f3n 2, la EPA evaluar\u00e1 y tratar\u00e1 de aplicar tecnolog\u00edas \ny pr\u00e1cticas sostenibles con respecto a esta alternativa. \nComo es la pol\u00edtica de la EPA, la Revisi\u00f3n a los 5 a \u00f1os se \nllevar\u00e1 a cabo para garantizar la integridad y eficacia del \nremedio seleccionado.   \nPARTICIPACI\u00d3N DE LA COMUNIDAD \nLa EPA invita al p\u00fablico a revisar los documentos que \nactualmente est\u00e1n disponible en le R\u00e9cord Administrativo del Lugar donde se detalla las actividades realizadas en el Lugar. \nPara m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n sobre el Lugar de Superfondo \nAntiguo Crematorio de Vega Baja incluyendo la alternativa preferida, favor comunicarse con: \nNancy Rodr\u00edguez Brenda Reyes \nGerente de Proyecto Relaciones con la \n(787) 977-5887 Comunidad \n(787) 977-5869 \nEPA \u2013 Divisi\u00f3n de Protecci\u00f3n Ambienta del Caribe \nEdificio Centro Europa \nAvenida Ponce de Le\u00f3n N\u00fam. 1492, Oficina 417 \nSan Juan, Puerto Rico 00908 \n(787) 977-5865 \nO accesar la pagina de Internet de la EPA a: \nhttp://www.epa.gov/region2/superfund/npl/vegabaja/ \nLas fechas para el per\u00edodo de comentarios p\u00fablicos; la \nfecha, el lugar y hora de la reuni\u00f3n p\u00fablica, y el Lugar  del R\u00e9cord Administrativo se proporcionan en la p\u00e1gina principal de esta hoja informativa. \n5\n \n500130  N I \no \nI\"'\"\"\"IijiO -\nPREUMINARY EXTENTS OF \nREMEDIATION AND POI N I \no \nI\"'\"\"\"IijiO -\nPREUMINARY EXTENTS OF \nREMEDIATION AND POI \n500131\n6\n  RESPONSIVENESS SUMMARY \nAppendix C \u2013 Public Meeting Attendance Sheet \n500132\u2022\u2022\u2022 \nSOLID VEGAVEGA BAJABAJA SOUD WASTEWASTE DISPOSALDISPOSAL SUPERFUNDSUPERFUND SITESITE \nPUBLICPUBUC MEETINGMEETING \nSIGN-INSIGN-IN SHEETSHEET . . \nDate: MeetingMeeting Oate: AugustAugust 33,, 20102010 \nComunidad Brisas MeetingMeeting Place:Place: Comunidad Brlsas deldel RosarioRosario,, VegaVega BajaBaja,, PRPR \nResldenclal DlrecdonDlrecdon ResidenclalNamelHombre Agendal Name/Nombre Teletono/PhoneTeletonoJPhone Agenda/ AgencyAgency E\u00b7MallE\u00b7Mall \nI ,, /Address/Address \nV'V\"<-<...v ~~'-'\"-\"'~ \nI~')~'I<\"'-\"'\" ,)~ I(1<..( rvu-P v'v'9fI9fI ())J. rvJ 00 \nS,fH'IdH4\"';: eL-S'(fm: I;{4rl: e L\u00ad+ ~t:-.P'>../ V ~\u00a3; \n//~ \n\"rljaJ-o-., r~ \na.-...,A.. oJ Il..;~ 7\"\"'-3 \nPPageage ) ooff88I \n500133VEGAVEGA BAJABAJA SOLIDSOLID WASTEWASTE DISPOSALDISPOSAL SUPERFUNDSUPERFUND SITESITE \nPUBLICPUBLIC MEETINGMEETING \nSIGN-INSIGN-IN SHEETSHEET\n. \nMeetingMeeting DateDate:: AugustAugust 3,3, 20102010 \nHeetingMeeting PlacePlace:: ComunidadComunidad BrisasBrisas deldel RosarioRosario,, VegaVega BajaBaja,, PRPR \nE-Mail \nt \nt E-Mail \n+ \nPage2of8Page 2 DrS \n500134VEGAVEGA BAJABAJA SOLIDSOLID WASTEWASTE DISPOSALDISPOSAL SUPERFUNDSUPERFUND SITESITE \nPUBLICPUBLIC MEETINGMEETING \n_______________ SIGN-INSIGN-IN SHEETSHEET \nMeetingMeeting Date:Date: AugustAugust 33,, 20102010 \nPlace: Rosario , Baja , MeetingMeeting Place : ComunidadComunidad BrisasBrisas deldel Rosario, VegaVega Baja, PRPR \nTeletono/PhoneTeletono/Phone Resldencial\n OlrecdonOlrecdon RestdencialNamelNamel NombreNombre Agenda'Agenda' AgencyAgency E-MailE-MailAddressAddress \nJt~ e,tJllj!; 012-;77' :>\u00ad 3~~ e-\"II\u00a3 012-77-1.. --rIvi/0 A/!_.I!_O)J:::J ~'\u00b7D II~A\"-O v\u00b7s\u00b7 clv//OA~Q 4'-0 IIJA~O (I.B\u00b7 \n,'P,'p-'h+13tJ7-q~4\"13tJ7 dF'\u00b7\"-~\u00b7l\"w\\dF\"\"-~'l\"w\\JOsE VAR61'15UOsE VAR6AS Il-tD AI.~(}Il-to f'\\~\"'r ~ \n~ + \n\u2022 )I}-a.r....

El descubrimiento del\n lugar, pues, normalmente, se da a cabo... se lleva a cabo de\n varias maneras, ya sea porque recibimos querellas ciudadanas,\n porque hay un referido por parte de alguna agencia estatal,\n porque personal de nosotros visit\u00f3 un lugar y encontr\u00f3 algunas\n \nFASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish\n \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

O sea, es un lugar en donde, pues, se\n encuentra una contaminaci\u00f3n. Esto es un proceso riguroso, una\n vez uno consigue informaci\u00f3n que sugiere que un lugar pueda\n estar contaminado, bajo un proceso de evaluaci\u00f3n y va a un\n panel, el cual considera la informaci\u00f3n y determina si, de\n hecho, este lugar debe ser incluido en la lista nacional de\n prioridades.\n \nEstos pasos ya nosotros los hemos andado para el\n \nlugar de superfondo aqu\u00ed, en Brisas del Rosario, se los estoy\n discutiendo a modo de trasfondo para que entiendan qu\u00e9 se ha\n hecho a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os en este lugar.\n \nUna vez el lugar es incluido en la lista nacional de\n \nFASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish\n \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt\n \nSan Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858\n \n5001498 \nprioridades, nosotros procedemos a hacer una investigaci\u00f3n\n \nremedial y un estudio de viabilidad. Estos son los dos pasos\n que se completaron para el lugar de superfondo de Vega Baja.\n Este estudio est\u00e1 dirigido a evaluar la naturaleza y la\n extensi\u00f3n de la contaminaci\u00f3n: qu\u00e9 tipo de contaminantes est\u00e1n\n presentes. Es d\u00f3nde se encuentran estos contaminantes. Y se\n utiliza esta informaci\u00f3n para establecer si existe\n contaminaci\u00f3n y si esa contaminaci\u00f3n presenta un riesgo a la\n salud p\u00fablica y al medioambiente. Y nosotros, a base del riesgo\n que puede presentar a la salud p\u00fablica y el medio ambiente,\n tomamos una decisi\u00f3n si, de hecho, existe la necesidad de\n llevar a cabo alg\u00fan tipo de limpieza o alguna actividad\n remedial para atender esta contaminaci\u00f3n.\n \nDe ser necesario, comenzamos a desarrollar\n \nalternativas para poder trabajar con esta contaminaci\u00f3n que\n est\u00e1 presente en el lugar. Estas alternativas se eval\u00faan, se\n eval\u00faa la viabilidad de poder implementar estas diferentes\n alternativas y eso es lo que, en bloque, se conoce como el\n estudio de viabilidad.\n \nEstos dos pasos se acaban de completar para este\n \nlugar. Se evalu\u00f3 la naturaleza y la extensi\u00f3n o se defini\u00f3 la\n naturaleza y la extensi\u00f3n de la contaminaci\u00f3n, se evalu\u00f3 el\n riesgo y se evaluaron las alternativas para atender la\n contaminaci\u00f3n que se encuentra presente.\n \nNancy, m\u00e1s adelante, lo que va a hacer es que va a ir\n \nFASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish\n \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

La agencia provee esta informaci\u00f3n a la\n \ncomunidad y al p\u00fablico, para que ustedes tengan una oportunidad\n no tan s\u00f3lo de conocerla, sino de poder expresar cualquier\n comentario que ustedes puedan tener antes de tomar una decisi\u00f3n\n aqu\u00ed. Y eso es lo que estamos haciendo en este per\u00edodo de\n comentarios p\u00fablicos, que termina en el mes de agosto. Y esta\n reuni\u00f3n p\u00fablica es una oportunidad que nosotros tenemos para\n poder sentarnos con ustedes, compartir la informaci\u00f3n que\n nosotros hemos recopilado y que ustedes puedan entender qu\u00e9 es\n esta informaci\u00f3n, qu\u00e9 quiere decir esta informaci\u00f3n y cu\u00e1les\n son los planes que se est\u00e1n proponiendo hacer.\n \nUna vez nosotros culminemos este proceso de\n \ncomentarios p\u00fablicos, nosotros entonces tomamos una decisi\u00f3n\n sobre qu\u00e9 hacer en el lugar y eso se plasma en un r\u00e9cord de\n decisi\u00f3n.\n \nUna vez se plasma en un r\u00e9cord de decisi\u00f3n, pasamos\n \nal pr\u00f3ximo paso, que consiste en dise\u00f1ar el remedio. Ya\n definimos la naturaleza y la contaminaci\u00f3n, decidimos que hay\n que tomar una acci\u00f3n remedial o hacer una limpieza, evaluamos\n las alternativas, el pr\u00f3ximo paso es dise\u00f1ar c\u00f3mo se van a\n \nFASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish\n \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

O sea, son pasos futuros.\n \nAhora mismo, nosotros estamos en el punto de tomar una decisi\u00f3n\n final sobre qu\u00e9 vamos a hacer.\n \nUna vez se dise\u00f1e el remedio, se construye dicho\n \nremedio.\n \nLuego que se construye el remedio, pues, este remedio \nse va evaluando a trav\u00e9s del tiempo \n)-Rub\u00e9n, si puedes darle \npara alante )- para asegurarnos que el remedio est\u00e1 cumpliendo \nsu cometido, que el remedio se est\u00e1 desempe\u00f1ando como se hab\u00eda dise\u00f1ado. Y esto es lo que se conoce como el monitoreo de post construcci\u00f3n. \nUna vez se termina la acci\u00f3n remedial y, por lo\n \ntanto, se concluye que est\u00e1 funcionando el remedio, pues,\n pasamos por el proceso de \"delistar\" el lugar. Quiere decir que\n se acab\u00f3 el trabajo en ese lugar, el lugar ha sido devuelto a\n uso beneficioso y pasamos para el proceso de \"delisting\".\n \nEs importante recalcar que, en todo momento, en el\n \nproceso de superfondo, nosotros estamos trabajando con\n contaminaci\u00f3n y con receptores, salud p\u00fablica y medioambiente.\n Y \u00e9sos son los dos elementos que, en todo momento, nosotros\n estamos pendientes y considerando en nuestro proceso de toma de\n decisiones.

Se estima que uno punto uno\n yardas... millones de yardas fueron tra\u00eddas al lugar.\n \nEn esa figura, se le est\u00e1 ense\u00f1ando...\n B\u00e1sicamente, \u00e9ste es el \u00e1rea residencial y \u00e9sta es el\n \n\u00e1rea que es no residencial, hacia los mogotes, para que tengan\n m\u00e1s o menos una idea de d\u00f3nde estamos en la figura.

Son muestras de campo que, b\u00e1sicamente,\n son la base para que la EPA haya comenzado una investigaci\u00f3n,\n pues, m\u00e1s formal.\n \nComo muchos conocen, desde la d\u00e9cada de los 70, se\n \ncomenz\u00f3 la construcci\u00f3n de residencias en el lugar. La primera\n inspecci\u00f3n fue en el 94 y, de ah\u00ed, dados los resultados, fue\n evolucionando a que hay una necesidad de m\u00e1s \"data\", de m\u00e1s\n recolecci\u00f3n de \"data\", de conocer mejor, porque est\u00e1bamos\n encontrando contaminantes en el lugar.\n \nEsto nos llev\u00f3 a que el lugar fue listado en la lista\n \nnacional de prioridades en el 99 y, luego de eso, con relaci\u00f3n\n a la unidad de suelos, en el 2003, las partes responsables\n firmaron una orden de consentimiento con la EPA, que fueron,\n como conocen, el municipio de Vega Baja, PREPA, Autoridad de\n Tierras, Departamento de Vivienda, Pfeizer, por comprar a\n Warner Lambert, que fue quien depositaba, BFI y Motorola.\n \nUna vez vemos toda esa \"data\" que le present\u00e9\n \nanteriormente, nos daba una base para decir: \"Mira, entendemos\n que hay una contaminaci\u00f3n en el lugar y deseamos hacer una\n investigaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s profunda. La EPA, entonces, divide el lugar\n en dos unidades operacionales.

No se pudo\n tomar aguas... muestras de agua, pero s\u00ed se tomaron muestras de\n sedimento. En algunas \u00e1reas, s\u00ed nos dio unas concentraciones de\n plomo y es por eso que lo estamos...

Cuando la EPA utiliza este modelo y llega\n \na... te da el n\u00famero, digamos, m\u00e1gico de cuatrocientos, es\n usando unos valores que se le llaman \"default values\", unos\n valores que son general. Una vez yo reemplazo esos valores con\n los valores espec\u00edficos del lugar, me da que, en el caso de\n Brisas del Rosario, el valor de el polvo residencial, tambi\u00e9n\n como el valor de agua de pluma, son mucho m\u00e1s bajos que los de\n \"default\", que los que corre el modelo, que me resulta\n cuatrocientos.\n \nQu\u00e9 sucede.

Yo le mencion\u00e9, cuando\n hice una introducci\u00f3n breve, antes de las preguntas y\n respuestas, que existe riesgo inminente a la salud p\u00fablica.\n Esto es inmediato. Por eso fue que, en estos luga... en este\n vecindario, se removi\u00f3 suelo contaminado a unas concentraciones\n que nosotros entend\u00edamos era lo suficientemente elevadas como\n para representar un riesgo inmediato.\n \nAhora, cuando nosotros miramos a largo plazo, miramos\n \na treinta a\u00f1os.

Si una persona es expuesta, a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os,\n a estas concentraciones. Y de ah\u00ed se saca unos valores de\n riesgo y se trabaja hacia atr\u00e1s para eliminarlos y llevarlos a\n unos niveles que son aceptables. \nO sea, que cuando estamos hablando a largo plazo es\n \nque si usted reside en su  casa, nosotros estamos asegurando\n \nque, de aqu\u00ed en adelante y en lo sucesivo, usted no debe sufrir\n efectos adversos a la salud p\u00fablica, porque estamos mirando a\n largo plazo.

Nanc y is going to be \ntalking to us about the history of the si te, where we presently are with regard to \nthe remedial investigation and the risk evaluation, what  are the results and the \nconclusions of these studies which hav e been carrying out here for quite some \nyears, the feasibility st udy and the alternatives which have been evaluated to \naddress the contamination f ound in the site and the next steps.  In summary, she \nis going to be talking to us about the proposed plan as to how it is proposed to address the contamination which has been found in the area. \nI am going to talk to you a bit about the superfund process. As you \nknow, this process\u2026we have been involved in an investigation process of the \nsituation present here, in the location of  Brisas del Rosario for a few years. \nThe superfund process of a generic location starts with the \ndiscovery of the site. The discovery of the site well normally  occurs\u2026is carried \nout several ways, be it because we receive citizen claims, because there is a referral from any state agency, because ou r personnel visited a site and found \nsome \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt \nSan Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 \n500219  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n   \n  7 \nthings which could be of concern as to the presence of hazar dous materials, and \nonce one discovers the site, well, one ev aluates the information at hand to \ndetermine whether under the superfund process, the location deserves to be \nconsidered. \nIf the information we have on hand leads us to believe that the \nplace can present a problem, a prelim inary study is made, a preliminary \nevaluation and an inspection of the site and what is basically used is existing \ninformation to determine if the site must be considered to be included in what is \nknown as the national priorities list. \nThe national priorities list is  the hit parade of contaminated \nlocations. That is, it is a site where, well there is contamination.  This is a \nrigorous process, once one obtains info rmation which suggests that a site may \nbe contaminated, under an ev aluation process and it goes to a panel which \nconsiders the information and determines whether in fact this place should be included in the nationa l priorities list. \nWe have already taken these steps for the superfund site here in \nBrisas del Rosario; I am discussing it  as background so that you understand \nwhat has been done through the years in this site. \nOnce the site is included in the national list of \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt \nSan Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 \n500220  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  8 \npriorities, we proceed to make a remedial investigation and a feasibility study. \nThese are the two steps that were comple ted in the for the Vega Baja superfund \nsite. This study is addressed to evaluat ing the nature and the extension of the \ncontamination: the type of contaminants present.  It is where these contaminants \nare found. And this information is used to es tablish if there is contamination and if \nthat contamination presents a risk to t he public health and t he environment.  And \nwe, based on the risk which it may present to the public health and the environment, decide if, in fact, there is  a need to perform some type of cleaning \nor some remedial activity to  address this contamination. \nIf necessary, we start to develop alternatives in order to work with \nthis contamination which is present in the site.  These alternatives are evaluated, \nthe feasibility of implementing these differe nt alternatives is evaluated, and that is \nwhat, in block, is known as the feasibility study. \nThese two steps have just been conc luded for this site.  The nature \nand the extension were evaluated or the nature and the extension of the \ncontamination were defined. The risk was evaluated and the alternatives to \naddress the contamination present were evaluated. \nLater, what Nancy is going to do is that she is going to go \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt \nSan Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 \n500221  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  9 \nover the conclusions of these studies  so that you may understand the type of \ncontamination found and t he alternatives being proposed which the agency is \nproposing to perform to address this contamination. \nNext step. The agen cy provides this information to the community \nand the public so that you have an opportuni ty not only to learn about it, but to \nexpress any comment you may have before a decision is made here. And that is \nwhat we are doing in this  period of public comments, which ends in the month of \nAugust. And this public meeting is an op portunity we have in order to sit with \nyou, share the information we have compil ed and that you may understand what \nthis information is, what this information means and what are the plans that are \nbeing proposed to be carried out. \nOnce we conclude this process of public comments, we then \ndecide what to do in the site and this is  reflected in a record of decision. \nOnce it is reflected in a record  of decision, we go on to the next \nstep, which consists of designing the remedy.  We already defined the nature \nand the contamination, we decided that remedial action must be taken or a \ncleaning, we evaluate the alternatives , the next step is to design how these \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt \nSan Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 \n500222  \n \n   \n  \n   \n \n     \n  10 \nalternatives are going to be implemented. \nFrom the record of the de cision onward these steps are \nprospective. That is, they are future st eps.  Right now we ar e at the point of \nmaking a final decision as to what we are going to do. \nOnce the remedy is designed, said remedy is constructed. After the remedy is constructed,  well, this remedy is evaluated \nthrough time -- Ruben if you can forward it \u2013 to make sure that the remedy is \ncomplying its objective that the remedy  is being performing as designed.  And \nthis is what is known as the post construction monitoring. \nOnce the remedial action is concluded and therefore, it is \nconcluded that the remedy is functioning, well, we go on to the process of \ndelisting the site. This means that the wo rk in that site has been completed, the \nplace has been returned to beneficial use and we go on to the delisting process. \nIt is important to emphasize that  at all times in the superfund \nprocess; we are working with contaminat ion and with receptors, public health and \nenvironment. And these are the two element s which we are at all times on the \nwatch for and considering in our decisi on making process.  And the purpose of \nthe superfund is to return the site to beneficial use. \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

Now, I am going to leave Nancy, so that she talks to you a bit about the history of  the site and takes you over the work \nbeing performed and what are the conclusions of that work and what is the plan proposed and the action being proposed to be carried out to address the contamination. \nMRS. RODRIGUEZ: Hello, welcome ev eryone.  I also want to thank you \nfor your time to be here with us tonight. \nAriel gave us a good introduction of the process we are going \nthrough there, in the site of  the Vega Baja Solid Waste Dis posal Site --- a bit the -\nAs we know, for thirty-one years from 48 to 79 there was brought \nhere\u2026 \nYou can hear better now. Material was brought, commercial, industrial and domestic waste \nand the burning of wa ste was also performed herein.  It is considered one point \none yards\u2026millions of yards were brought to the site. \nIn this figure, you are being shown\u2026 Basically, this is the residential area and this is the area which is \nnot residential, towards the hummocks, so that you have more  or less an idea of \nwhere we are at in the figure. And here we are showing how the area started to \nbe covered of the \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt \nSan Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 \n500224  \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n  12 \nwaste being deposited. \nWith this graphic what I wish to show basically is t hat here we have \na summary of the amount of samples initia lly taken. They are field samples which \nbasically are the basis for EPA starting a well, more formal investigation. \nAs many known, from the decade of the 70s, the construction of \nhouses was commenced on the site. The fi rst inspection was in 94 and from \nthere given the results, it evolved to the ne ed for more data, of more collection of \ndata, of better knowing, because we we re finding contaminants in the site. \nThis took us to the site being list ed in the national priorities list in \n99, and thereafter, with regard to the soils unit in 2003,  the parties responsible \nsigned an Order of Consent wit h EPA that were as you know the Municipality of \nVega Baja, PREPA, the Land authority, the Housing Department, Pfizer, due to \npurchase from Warner Lambert, who was the one who deposited, BFI and \nMotorola. \nOnce we have all that data whic h I previously presented, this gave \nus basis to say: \u201cLook we  understand there is contami nation in the site and we \nwish to make a more at depth investigation.  EPA then divides the place in two \noperational units. Once is the undergr ound water and the other is the soil. \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt \nSan Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 \n500225  \n \n    \n \n  \n    \n   13 \nAt the time, we started with t he underground water operational unit \nwhich some time back we were presenting the results, and basically after the \ninstallation of the wells, the results obtai ned from water samples, also the canal, \nthe drainage ditch, Rio Indio,  waterholes were also sampled, we found that there \nwas not contaminant related to the place in the underground waters. \nTherefore, a record of decision was signed, recommending no \naction for the site in 2004. It is then t hat we move to the soil operational unit and \nwe started an environm ental investigation. \nWhat is my objective? What do  I want to achieve?  Where am I \ngoing? This evaluation, bas ed on the data we had initially  collected, we decided \nto outline we decided to characterize w hat is the contamination in the site. \nWe searched, also with study, to determine how far it reached; the \nextension of this contam ination and, later, evaluate the risks; what risks are \npresented by the contaminants present  to human health and the environment. \nWhat the soil investigation basi cally included were some samples in \nthe residential zone, samples in areas, sa mples in properties were the old data, \nthe original data showed us t hat there was a need of having \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt \nSan Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 \n500226  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  14 \nmore laboratory data, more definitive data, a more profound investigation. \nAs in these residencies samples were taken for lead, both in the \nsoil as well as inside the homes, in the water tap, in the tap water and also in the \ndust inside the homes. \n  Also in the whole residential area, what is Br isas del Rosario, what \nis the complete site, which is what I am showing here, in the figure, samples \nwere taken around the whole area for other contaminants, to learn if they were \npresent and if they presented any concern in the site. \nSamples were also taken in the non-residential area, which is the \nlandscape area below which is the area which is to wards the hummocks, which \nis not developed, to outline what is the extension of le ad in that area and if there \nwas another contaminant of concern. This area below incl udes seventeen acres \nof land, which was all sampled. \nBefore I go on, I added this note here, below, because EPA has \nwhat is called the superfund lead contami nated residential site sample, it is a \nhandbook, it is a guide which helps to study  sites such as Brisas del Rosario, \nwhich have lead contamination and it is in a residential area. \nBasically the guide gives you an idea or gives you certain \ndirections, certain recommendations as to how you are going to take the \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt \nSan Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 \n500227  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n 15 \nsamples, where to take them, how to understand the data,  how\u2026what to do \nwith the data, it takes all this proce ss of identifying and ev aluating in places \nwhich are residential and cont ain lead.  We use it as a guideline, which assisted \nus in the process. \nAdditionally, during the soil invest igation, we took samples in the \nmounds, in those promontories of waste, that we have four, that we can see \nthem in brown, we have one,  two, the one above, thr ee and one around the other \nchurch. That well, as you know there was\u2026 an unauthorized removal was started and already well we advanced and that one was removed and it was \naccommodated in the undevelop ed area.  For that reason now we are left with \nbasically three mounds of wast e or promontories of waste. \nIn these places here, in the waste, lead samples were taken, but \nalso for other analysis or compounds to  determine what contaminants were a \nconcern in that area. \nAnd finally, background samples were taken, which is what we \nknow in English as background. They are areas we seek near the site, but which \nhas not been impacted by any activity. What we seek is to see a reference of what are the concentrations let\u2019s say that  natural from these contaminants or \nfrom these metals, for ex amples, in these area which have not been altered by \nany construction or by any\u2026work whic h has been performed which has impacted \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt \nSan Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 \n500228  \n \n   \n  \n   \n \n \n \n   16 \nthese soils. \nNow I am going to show you some figures and, in these figures, \nbasically you can see where the samples were taken. Here I am emphasizing the \nresidential area and as we can see the ma jority is concentrated between Santa \nMaria Alturas Street and Los Angeles Or tiz and this area here, in progress. \nOnce I emphasize that these area arise form the results which had \npreviously been taken in the whole ar ea, in the two hundr ed thirteen houses, \nwhich is what includes the fifty five acres of property  in the residential area. \nWhat I had previously explained, that for contaminants other than \nlead, all this residential part was separated,  they were separat ed in blocks.  And \nwhat we sought here was to have a representation of the different areas, but \nwhat we are seeking was to collect sa mples based on what we need to make a \nrisk evaluation. That is what led us to make this\u2026let\u2019s say these different figures \nhere, to separate the blocks and what we  sought was to satisfy the need of data \nwhich the risk evaluation requests, in order  to know for other contaminants that \nare not lead, if there is a risk to  human health or to the ecological. \nThis is the nonresidential area. They are seventeen acres in green, \nbelow, in the figure. Basically, \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt \nSan Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 \n500229  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  17 \nthe whole area was also shown and as we can see, they were sufficient samples \nto know how far my contamination reaches. \n  And fin\u2026the next. \nAnd finally, this is what I meant by the background areas.  If you \nsee, open areas were taken, which have had no construction, no building. Basically they are areas that  can give us an idea of the natural concentration of \nthese contaminants or  of these metals at the location. \nI added this figure, but basically, th is is part of what was done in the \ninvestigation of the under ground water.  When I mentioned that wells were \ninstalled, also at that time, the idea wa s to take samples in the drainage ditch \nwhich you have, which runs by Alturas and  up to Rio Indio, bu t as you well know, \nit is principally dry. We were unable to take water\u2026samples of water, but \nsamples of sediment were taken.  In some  areas, it did give us concentrations of \nlead and that is why we are\u2026 Within  the action we are recommending for the \nsite, we are including the drainage ditch for cleaning. \nThat taking that\u2026all t hat data, that all that data is analyzed, in this \nbox, well I can \u2026 basically, we have th e documents here, available, certain \ndocuments are generated, which are reviewed by different experts of the \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt \nSan Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 \n500230  \n \n   \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n    \n 18 \nAgency and the conclusion is reached that t he lead, definitely is a problem in the \nsite and here, I am giving a few of the values we found. \nThe residential soil, in the surface area, I am giving a rank of \nseventy nine to thirteen hun dred milligrams per kilogr am.  That was what we \nfound in the\u2026 in the\u2026in the data collected .  The soil at depth, there was an area \nthat reached up to twenty six thousand milligrams per kilogram of lead. \nAs we can see in the trash mounds, we have some values a bit \nhigher. We have realized that it is in  the trash mounds and the non residential \narea, is where I have higher va lues of lead in the site. \nIn the residential dust\u2026 \nI basically used this data to run the risk analysis models I was \nrequired, basically information of the site, a more specific information. Basically, \nwe wanted to see what t he concentration of dust inside the residences.  It gave \nus a maximum of eight hundred twenty- four, but the average was some lower \nvalues. That is why there remains an average of one hundred twenty-two. \nThe same with the tap water. T hat data I used basically to run the \nrisk model and see then what is  my situation as to risk to the human health at the \nsite. \nDuring the investigation and the\u2026 the data that was collected, we \nalso found some sporadic excesses of ant imony, chrome, thallium, zinc and iron, \nalso they were more oriented toward s the \u2026trash mounds and towards the non \nresidential area. \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

And the values, such as arsenic, \nchrome and manganese were found\u2026alt hough they were above the values of \nresidence, it is compared with the background analysis we had performed.  For \nthose samples which I explained that were in places that have not been \nimpacted, near the area, upon co mparing them, they are cert ain levels that are in \naverage pretty close, therefore, it is conc luded that it is not re lated to the place, \nrather it is the parti cularity of the soil. \nOnce we have all that data, wh at do we do with it ?  Here we have \nChuck Nays, who is our toxicologist and he basically, is the leader by evaluating \nthe documents which are \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

It is  basically\u2026.what is sought is to see the \nexposure to this chemical, in our case, the exposure to  the chemical, what does it \nmean, what does it represent, to the resi dents, be they adult or  children, for the \nintermittent visitors, which is the perso n who comes, plays, visits, leaves, \ntherefore, it is not exposed day to day but may come frequently and the \nconstruction worker who has a minor expo sure, but who may come to the place. \nWhat is the exposure for this  type of persons when there are \nchemicals in the soil, in dust and in vegetables.  The conclusion was that there is no\u2026The risk of cancer, present by the cont aminants of the place, is not high.  It \nis within EPA\u2019s ranges. Therefore, we understand there is no problem of a risk of cancer. \nThe hazard, which are the compo unds that are not carcinogens.  It \nwas determined that it is principally a ssociated with the compounds I said, that \nalthough they exceeded EPA\u2019s reference val ues, they were at values that were \nsimilar to the conditions of the site, to the background samples, the background \nsamples, what we see in this region. \nAnd, basically, it was concluded  that lead we know is a problem, \nand for the levels that one may find in the \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

Therefore, it leads me \nto what we need to do and take action in the site. \nThe risk to the environment, the ecological risk. What did we do \nthere? Basically, first there is an evaluati on an inspection of w hat are the species \nthat we can see in this area, in this region in Puerto Rico. And based on the \nspecies that may be present, the ecological  receptors that may be present, birds, \nbats were selected, I believe there is the Puerto Rican boa, which are species \nthat may be present in the site. \nThe risk to these receptors with regard to lead are evaluated.  It \nwas concluded that the contam inant presents a level una cceptable for the birds. \nWhat does this mean? That obviously the lead for the birds is also a problem we \nhave that then we must post a cleaning or a remediation. \nFor the other contaminants. In the other concentrations seen in the \nsite, the risk to the ecological receptor s is minimal.  Therefore, we again \nconclude that we have to do something wi th the lead.  What are we going to do? \nHow are we going to resolve this problem? What alternatives do I have? What technology exists for me to clean up which basically \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

What does this mean? I seek my \nobjective. My objective that I want to ca rry out in the site. What am I going to \nclean? How much am I going to clean? and then I evaluate what is available in \nthe market for me to resolve this problem. \nMy objectives here are basically to  prevent or minimize the contact \nof the persons\u2026the human cont act, the contact of the \u2026. of the birds, which we \nalready saw was a problem wit h regard to lead, in areas such as the residential \narea, in the properties w here it was identified ther e was a problem, in the \nmounds of waste and in the non residential area. \nMy objective here is that I must  resolve or minimize the direct \ncontact to these areas with high lead content.  And we also want, to resolve the \necological problem, eliminate the lead contact to protect the receptors. \nEPA then makes\u2026Of all this informa tion we have collected, what \nthe risk evaluation has told me, the refer ence values we have as to lead, we \nsearch for an analysis and we arrive at t he conclusion that of  four hundred fifty \nmilligrams of kilograms, is going to be my value, it is going to be my clean up goal in the site. That is a  \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

I know my problem, I know what I \nwant to achieve, my objective, my goal, I know the value I have to reach, how am \nI going to do it? What technologies ex ist so that I can then reach my goal? \nWe have these technologies, pre tty simple and which are feasible \nfor the Vega Baja site. The first is to ex cavate soil.  Arrive, remove, excavate the \nsoil remove it from the site. What can we do with this excavated soil?  It is either \nremoved, to a landfill or it may be cons olidated in an area\u2026 In the case of Vega \nBaja, it would be to the nonresidential ar ea.  It can be consolidated there and a \ncover of soil is placed which basic ally minimizes my exposure to the \ncontaminated soil. \nContainment. That is to place a cover of soil. You can place a \ncover of soil and basically, you are\u2026 \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

This involves treatment. Basically, \nhere we would be bringing cement or lime and it would be mixed with the \ncontaminated soil. Everything that has unacceptable lead leve ls would be mixes \nto solidify it; so that the lead loses its mobility and avoid the direct contact and in \nthe future well it could affect or cont aminate another type of soil or reach the \nunderground water. \nOther technology for the dust in the residents is removal. \n  And finally institution\u2026institutio nal controls. What are institutional \ncontrols? Basically they ar e certain use restrictions, re strictions which basically \nlimit the use of the contaminated area, as well  as limits excavation where there is \ncontaminated soil. \nWhat can we do in Brisas del Ro sario with regard to the alternative \nof soil excavation? When I say, arrive, excavate, remo ve soil, what do I mean?  I \nam referring to the trash mounts, to the trash mounds.

And with the soil that is contamin ated it is either sent to a landfill, as I \nhad previously mentioned or it is taken to an area where it may be consolidated \nand covered. \n  The containment alternative\u2026 Here I added what\u2026when we talk \nabout the geotextile membrane,  it is what you can see in the photo below, it is \u2026 \nsimply a physical barrier to, once it is pl aced, if there is any  excavation in the \nfuture, you may note: \u201cLook the prior re moval reached here, from there onward \nthere is\u2026.there may be c ontaminated soil or waste.\u201d \nThen as you may see in this figu re, first the membrane is laid and \nthen a foot is placed, twelve  inches of soil on top and that would be the cover. \nTo avoid then the erosion of the site, a vegetative layer is also added, after \nconcluding with the layer of soil. This  technology requires maintenance, because \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

You extract water and you extract \nthe material, it may be cement or it may be lime, and basically what you are doing is mixing it with the contaminated soil, so  that then the c ontaminated soil is \nmixed and creates, then\u2026It is  seen as weak cement, as weak cement once you \nhave all that mixed, to solid ify it in contaminated soil. \nI have these technologies:  I can excavate; I can put a cover of soil; \nI can solidify. These tec hnologies, what do I do wit h them now? Well, I group \nthem in alternatives. CERCLA requires me that one of my alternatives be no \naction. And it is rather to have a point of comparison .  In no action, what I am \nsaying is: \u201cI am not going to do anything.

All these alternatives have \ncertain common elements and t hese elements are the instit utional controls that I \nhad already mentioned. Obvi ously, except the alternat ive of no action.  It calls \nfor a pre-design investigation.  In the design is where we in detail discuss all the \nlogistics, all the \u2026how this alternative is  to be implemented, of  the design, of the \nremediation, of the clean up.

In the event\u2026 As we have the drainage \nditch, it would be divided so that the rain water goes through the channel, they \ndon\u2019t stay in residence, that way they reac h the Rio Indio.

We cannot go into your homes without \nyour permission, authorization to enter . So, before we perform any of these \nalternatives, we must request the per sons where we have to enter their \nproperties, access to the properties. A nd then, now everything is green, now \neverything is green. \nSo, the region, EPA Region 2 has developed a green clean-up \npolicy for superfund sites that  we are going to be taking  into consideration and \nthis includes, well, recycling of materi als, everything that  may save energy\u2026 A \ntreatment system could be using solar energy\u2026 Any aspect that could be \nimplemented, that is going to be tak en into consideration in the design. \nWe have the alternatives. We know what we want to do in the site. \nWe know how much we wish to clean up . But how do I select it? I select \nalternative 1, 2, 3, 4. It is not like t hat, it is not at random, it is not so easy. \nThe superfund program has nine cr iteria which helps us to evaluate \nthem. To evaluate them in a detailed manner, to make  a correct decision as to \nresolving the problem of contamination in the site. \nThese criteria are how does the alternative protect obviously our \nmission, the human health and the environ ment.  How does it comply with the \napplicable requisites, applicabl e regulations and appropriate in the site.  What is \nmy \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

The same as short-te rm. What does this alternative mean at \nshort term? What is the reduc tion of toxicity, mobility or volume of contaminants. \nAnd that is when there is treatment. This  is through the treatment.  How does it \nreduce, how toxic is the contaminant or how mobile is the contaminant. \nThe implementability.  Perhaps ther e is a fabulous alternative, but it \nis not something that is feasible in Puerto  Rico.  And it is also evaluated to see if \nit is an alternative t hat may be implemented. \nThe cost is evaluated, the acc eptance of the state agency, which in \nthis case is the Envir onmental Quality B oard and the acceptance of the \ncommunity, that is why we are here tonight and that is  why we opened a period \nfor comments, because you also have partic ipation within the evaluation of these \nalternatives. \nHere I want to show you, basically, how the alternatives compare \none with the other with regard to my nine criteria. And basically, what I want to \nshow you is that the alternative of no action, if you see, does not protect the \nhuman health and does not protect\u2026does  not comply with the applicable \nrequisites. Why? Because it is to do nothi ng; it is to leave the contamination as \nis. Therefore, it is something that does  not comply with my criteria. The other \nalternatives do comply. \n  The long-term efficiency. Remove everything from the \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

But basically, we are moving the contamination from \npoint A to point B, and in point B we ll, one would then have to take certain \nmeasures at long-term to ensure that it is not an exposure in another location. \nThe reduction of toxicity, mobility or volume through treatment, \nwhat I am indicating here is that it is not that the other alternatives\u2026These do \npresent a minimization or a prevention of  direct exposure to the contaminant. \nBut since this criteria is only through tr eatment and excavation is not a treatment, \nonly when it is mixed with what I mentioned about  the cement or lime, it is the \nonly thing that is considered treatment, it is due to this that alternative 4 is the \nonly one that can reduce the toxicity or mobili ty or volume.  In this case, it does \nnot reduce the volume, because the volume remains the same, but it does \nreduce the mobility of the lead. \nAnd then there are the costs.  As you can see we have\u2026 Excuse \nme, implementability, they ar e all implementable. They ar e all alternatives that \ncan be carried out here.  Some easier and one more difficult.  For example, \nhaving to stabilize and bring cement and lime, that entails certain additional \nstudies, because one has to make some\u2026It is an alternative, well, which has not been practiced here and one would seek \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

And that would entail that additional study . Therefore, it is \nimplementable but it takes a bit more work. \nThe same well with alternative 3.  It is implementable, but then, we \nalready went into the problem of choos ing the landfill and the capacity of the \nlandfill to receive an amount, a volume whic h is pretty big of land that would be \nremoved from the site. \nAcceptance by the state agency, the Environmental Quality Board, \nwell, which has been working with us fr om the beginning,  they have also \nparticipated in the review of the doc uments and making comments.  They have \nalready reviewed the proposed plan we have for the superfund site here in Vega \nBaja. They already issued their letter of support for the alternative we are going to be presenting as the preferred alter native, which is alternative 2, the \nalternative of removal, excavation of soil in the residential ar ea, in trash mounds, \nin the drainage ditch and consolidate them in the area that y ou have which is non \nresidential and cover them with soil. They already issued the letter of support.  \nThe community\u2019s acceptance, this  criteria is still open, because we \nare in the process of public  comments and it is now that  we are evaluating what \nis your acceptance as to alternative 2, which is the \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

When EPA uses this model and arrives at\u2026it gives \nyou the number, let\u2019s say, m agic of four hundred, is using certain values which \nare called \u201cdefault values,\u201d some values which are general.

In the case of Brisas, it gave me a range between \nfive hundred sixty six to six hundred five, whic h is a conservative value.  It is what \nthe model, similar to the manner, with the national values used by EPA, to derive \nthe four hundred with the s pecific values of the place, it  indicates that a protective \nvalue is leaving\u2026having a value of lead of  between a range of five hundred sixty \nsix to six hundred five. \nWhat happens?

It is a carcinogen. \nWhen this study is published, the concentrations which qualified for \nthe superfund, according to Sepulveda wo uld take twenty years \u2013and sets 99 \u2013 \nto continue running towards the sea, under the water.  If a lining had been placed \nhere so that the rain does not percol ate underneath, whatev er, the underground \nwater runs towards the sea, anyway.

One hundred meters around is  the influence area, according to the \nwork of those who work with the use of water for Aqueduct and the specialists in \nthis field. I am going to say that I am  a specialist in natural resources that I \nworked in that scientific investigations area. \nThat means that the water, around one hundred meters from where \nit suctions for use of all of you and all of us, shall be influenced by the \ncontaminants there, whether they have a lining or not, because it is going to be \nsuctioning and the water molecules are like magnets that attract each other, \nbecause they have loads like magnets.

Thank you very much. \nMRS. REYES: Thank you for your comments. \n(Pause.) \nMR. FONT: Yes, thank you very much for the very broad comment. We \nshall try to handle it step by step.  If here in Puerto Ric o, precisely in the northern \narea, it is a karst zone, you mentioned t here are many places we have passed by \nthe contaminants, volatile organic compounds, carcinogens, but on the other \nhand, many of them are already in remediation.  Through the y ears of working in \nthose places we have rea lized that the quicker the place is mobilized and one \nworks with the contamination source, the le ss time it would take us to remediate \nit, but anyway, once these contaminants reach the underground  waters, we are \ntalking about thirty years in \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

And we are not talking about the carcinogen risks, rather non \ncarcinogens. And we must keep focu sed on the lead in the soil and the \nremediation we are discussing today. \nIn general terms, I could also add that this karst formation of the \nnorth provides for the quick flow, at high speed of contami nants in underground \nwaters. They all discharge into the sea. The best would be to intercept them as \nquickly as possible, before this happens. The situation could exacerbate with the \nextraction of excessive under ground water in that area. Several things have \noccurred which have eased this: cleaning, supertube, several things which have \noccurred, but certainly, the immense majority of these places are being \naddressed. And significant amounts have been extracted throughout the years, \nthrough the superfund program of vo latile organic compounds of the \nunderground water. \nMRS. REYES: Very respectfully the flow of underground water, in the \ncase raised by Sepulveda, without interv ention by the superf und flow, would take \ntwenty years to correct and get out of t hat. Twenty years gives time for one to \nbioconcentrate one carcinogenic contaminant.  One. \nI must also differ that the iron in  soil is not carcinogenic.

But putting that \npoint aside, science itself showed that by these three ways, fugitive dust, \nunderground water of the east of Vieques, that in Esperanza there is an aquifer \nof two percent to four, it does go th rough because the iron becomes ferric, by \nchanges in ionization, loss of electrons and it becomes availa ble. And it is \ncarcinogenic. Lead is the same. I diffe r but this is part of science.  \nMR.

But before that happens there is a legal part which is the one, at \ntimes that brings a bit of uncertainty as to how long it takes between EPA and the \nparties responsible for negotiation how it is going to happen, how we are going to \nmove the participation of t he parties responsible in the part of the design and \nimplementation.  And this could delay  the process a bit, because a short \nnegotiation could occur, and perhaps not.  A nd once it is negotiated, once that \nlegal document is signed, it is then that the responsible parties start the design. \nAnd then we shall be finalizing the details and have a \u2026let\u2019s say a better \nestimate of when, then, we would be starting the work. \nMRS.

What this means is that, if it is already saturated, no \nmore water can be provided,  one of the issues mentioned by the gentleman is \ncomplied, which would contaminate the water more. \nAnd second, we would loose the capacity of reloading the aquifer, \nwhich is already\u2026there would be less than t hat available, but with more houses. \nAnd third, do you know what happens when you\u2026we extract more \nwater from the aquifer than what flows?  It is  like a river.  If we take out the water, \nthen water form the sea comes in. And we have images here also showing the \npoint where it meets under t he aquifer, the saline intrusion which in Barceloneta, \nin 84, passed to the south of Road 2 and what we extracted was saltwater. \nWhat happens if the aquifer becom es saline by all of this? Besides \nthe existing conditions to contaminate in the manner of cr eating cancer, would \nbe, for more than twenty years, if \u2026if the aquifer is reloaded, it would take a long \ntime to expel the saline intrusion and we would not have water.  Not sometimes, but when it is drawn it was going to be sa ltwater.  That is the importance of the \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

The other condition s, if projects continue to  be approved in this area, \nso that there is a risk to public safety, that is another matter, I am not going to continue elaborating because of the time, but  I also want to vote, as Disraeli \nGutierrez indicates, that if the company  was able to generate its private income \nat the cost of damaging the environment, there is a federal law RCRA, whoever \nsoils must clean-up. And if they were good to it, its company, to generate the \nincome, it should be good to clean up what it soiled. Thank you very much. \nMRS.

Greetings to Dr. Carl \nSoderberg.  I remember that when we went  to the encounter of  the federal Coral \nReef Task Force, that was held now, in 2009 at the Caribe Hilton, we talked about this matter. Another person talked about this type of thing, of permit issue \n\u201cI don\u2019t have jurisdiction,\u201d with\u2026he replie d correctly, from EPA, for the use of \nland. But it results that for water, yes. And in the measure that an action impacts \nthe water for human consumption, which is what we are raising here, the aquifer \nbecomes saline, a vital resource, nothing is  more important than water \u2013 forget \nabout the light \u2013 there is  no life without water. \nMr. Carl Soderberg, there is material here to have jurisdiction that \nthey do not seal the reloading zone of  the aquifer and that they do not\u2026 and \nthere the use of the land does not have to enter into jurisdicti on.  Simply, all the \nstudies indicate since the 80s. That is why the Law was created to protect the \nkarst of 1999, Act No. 292, in 1984, 85, t he protection of the caves, caverns and \nsinkholes and they are \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

They are laws of \nPuerto Rico, but they are going to impact the water. \nWell the Environmental Quality B oard to take jurisdiction and EPA \nwho could assume jurisdiction, because if they make the water saltwater there is \nno water available. That is the challenge. Thank you very much. \nMRS.

When you \nsay long-term risk to the persons who live  here, how many years does that mean \nto you? Long-term. \nMR. FONT: Yes, I see t hat this, this term always raises doubts and this is \nnot the exception. I mentioned it, when I made a brief introduction, before the questions and answers, that there is immin ent risk to the public health. That is \nimmediate. That is why, in these pl ac\u2026in this neighborhood,  we removed soil \ncontaminated at concentrations we underst ood were sufficiently high to represent \nan immediate risk. \nNow, when we look long-term, we look at thirty years.  Normally, it \nis the risk that could exis t if the person is exposed \u2026 Allow me, allow me to \nexplain. If a person is exposed, throughou t the years, to these concentrations. \nAnd from there are obtained certain va lues of risks and we work back to \neliminate and take them to acceptable levels. \nThat is that when we talk long-term it is if you reside in your house, \nwe are ensuring that, from here onwar d and hereinafter, you must not suffer \nadverse effects to public health, because we  are looking long-term.  At long-term. \nAt short-term it would be if I determine that the \nFAYSO REPORTERS \u2013 English and Spanish \n510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

Or I have to take action or re move soil. But here we are talking about \nprospectively making sure that should yo u reside there for a long period, make \nsure that you are not going to receive any  adverse effect. And that is what we \nare\u2026that is what we mean. \nAnd the clean-up is not at thirty years, they just\u2026said here.  The \nclean-up is done immediately. These are engineering works, removal of soil, \nconsolidation\u2026.This does not take a l ong time.  Perhaps, a negotiation. But \nthese actions are carried out with\u2026with certai n immediacy, that I don\u2019t believe it \nis going to take long.\n (Pause.) \nMRS. GARCIA: Those lands that you plan to clean up now\u2026 \nMRS. REYES: What is your name? \nMRS. GARCIA: Nydia Garcia. T he land you plan to clean now, because \nthey appear on the map like they are cont aminated, there are persons who live \nthere, for more than fifty years, more or  less, about that, because there are many \npersons there\u2026 That is, these persons who have already been there, let\u2019s say \ndealing with those lands si nce then, what would happen to those persons who \nhave been there for a long time with that contamination?

For example, when the risk is being evaluated, one goes and seeks the highest concentration f ound in the whole neighborhood and one \nassumes that every person w ho lives there is going to be exposed to that.  Then, \none looks at that prospectively towards the future. \nTherefore, what I am saying is they are co nservative hypothetical \nscenarios. They assume the worst of the situations for alls and each one of you and based on that, decision are made.
