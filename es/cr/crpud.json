The vaccine is especially important this year, with \nCOVID -19 making more people sick.  \nThe flu is a serious illness. By getting your annual flu vaccine, you are doing your part to keep yourself and \nthose around you healthy \u2014especially older people, people in congregate care, and those with chronic diseas-\nes. \nThe flu vaccine is available to all AICs, takes only a few minutes to get, and is safe and effective. It cannot give \nyou the flu. DOC Health Services will provide the vaccine to any AIC interested in receiving it. Each AIC will be \ncalled out and asked to accept or decline the shot.  \nIt\u2019s also important to get the vaccine every year because the flu virus changes from year to year. Each year, \nthe vaccine is updated to target the strains of the virus that are most likely to get us sick. You can also get the \nflu vaccine at the same time as a COVID -19 vaccine or booster.  \n \nPara: Todos los adultos bajo custodia  \nAsunto: Vacunas contra la gripe  \n \nEl Departamento Correccional desea recordar a todos los AIC que vacunarse contra la influenza es seguro y \nf\u00e1cil, y la mejor manera de protegernos a nosotros mismos y a los dem\u00e1s de la influenza. La vacuna es espe-\ncialmente importante este a\u00f1o, ya que el COVID -19 est\u00e1 enfermando a m\u00e1s personas.  \n \nLa gripe es una enfermedad grave. Al recibir su vacuna anual contra la influenza, est\u00e1 haciendo su parte para \nmantenerse saludable y mantener saludables a quienes lo rodean, especialmente a las personas mayores, las \npersonas en cuidado colectivo y las personas con enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas.  \n \nLa vacuna contra la influenza est\u00e1 disponible para todos los AIC, toma solo unos minutos y es segura y efec-\ntiva. No puede darte la gripe. DOC Health Services proporcionar\u00e1 la vacuna a cualquier AIC interesado en rec-\nibirla. Se llamar\u00e1 a cada AIC y se le pedir\u00e1 que acepte o rechace el tiro. \n \nTambi\u00e9n es importante vacunarse todos los a\u00f1os porque el virus de la gripe cambia de un a\u00f1o a otro. Cada \na\u00f1o, la vacuna se actualiza para atacar las cepas del virus que tienen m\u00e1s probabilidades de enfermarnos. \nTambi\u00e9n puede recibir la vacuna contra la influenza al mismo tiempo que una vacuna o un refuerzo contra el \nCOVID -19. \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  Here\u2019s what a G.P. Committee member has to say  \nThe dictionary defines legacy as something that has come \nfrom a predecessor or the past.  \nI do not want to be defined by how I put myself in prison, \nbut rather what I did with myself to change while I was \nhere. The past is the past, it is how we are where we are \nright this moment. I \u2019ve worked very hard over the years \nand from day one in this program to totally change into a \nnew version of myself. This new version of myself is full of \nself-confidence, integrity, trust, honesty, and respect. This \nbuild is never ending and on -going day in and day out. \nWhen I walk out these gates, I want the world to see all \nthis. These things are also very important for my minions to \nsee and learn. This is the work that lies ahead of me in \neveryday life, how could life get any better than sharing \ntime with family and always doing the right thing for the \nright reason. So, to my fellow peers take the time to look at \nyourself and figure out what you want in your life and for \nyour life. It \u2019s all here and its your time, find change a chal-\nlenge and go after it. What can it hurt to try something new \nthat can lead you to having total control of your life?  \nRemember: you can never go wrong by being grateful.  \n \n \nDouglas Powell  \nExit Date 9/12/2022  Page 7 Be on the lookout for the G.P.

You may report \nin person to any staff, through an AIC communication, through the grievance system, \nby calling the PREA hotline by making a language selection, then dialing 91 from any \nAIC phone.   \n \nFiling an Anonymous PREA Report  \n \nIf you are uneasy about filing a PREA allegation, you may file an anonymous report \nwith an outside agency.    \n \nYou may write to:  \n \nGovernor \u2019s Constituent Services Office  \n900 Court Street NE, Suite 254  \nSalem, Oregon 97301  \n \nPlease indicate in the beginning of your letter you are filing a PREA allegation and you \nare requesting to remain anonymous.  The Governor \u2019s Office will refer all anonymous \nallegations to the DOC PREA Coordinator to assure an investigation is completed \nbased off the information that is provided.    \n \nOpposite Gender Viewing/Announcements  \n \nOpposite gender staff announcement themselves when entering a housing unit by \nringing a bell.  This must be done any time the status quo of the gender supervision on \na housing unit changes (if there is already an opposite gender staff on the unit then \nthere is not needed to re -announce).  When you hear the doorbell, opposite gender \nstaff will be entering the housing unit so please make sure you are covered up appro-\npriately.  \n \nIt is also important you undress in the appropriate locations.  If you are located in a \nbunk area, there are cameras throughout the facility so the designated changing/\nbathroom areas are the only areas you should be without undergarments.  Opposite \ngender viewing may happen incidentally when staff are conducting routine cell checks.  \nYou can minimize this by keeping aware of the gender of supervision in your housing \nunit and ensuring you cover up when possible.  \n \nCommunity -Based PREA Advocacy (Support) Program  \n \nODOC has partnered with community based, confidential advocates of sexual abuse \nvictims to provide services to AICs.   \n \n \nPage 18  \n \n \n \n \n \nAICs at ODOC who have experienced sexual abuse may reach a community -based \nadvocate by making a language selection, entering your AIC PIN, then press 0*711 \nAIC telephone systems, or may request a private call through the PREA Compliance \nManager at the facility.    Advocates provide victims of sexual abuse information about \ntheir options, resources, information and emotional support. There is no charge for \ncalls to advocates.  \n \nThe community -based advocacy crisis line is for individuals needing assistance coping \nwith sexual abuse related issues and should not be used for other purposes.  \n \nTelephone calls and mail with community -based advocacy centers is considered privi-\nleged communication and will be handled similar to legal calls/official mail. All advoca-\ncy calls are not monitored or recorded.  \n \nAdvocates provide confidential support and crisis intervention, inform you about the in-\nvestigation and medical examination process, educate you about healing from sexual \nabuse and offer resources and referrals  \n \nAdvocates will n ot tell you what to do, communicate with the institution unless you re-\nquest them to do so and sign a release and will n ot provide legal advice.  \n \nCommunity -based advocacy centers provide sexual abuse support to people of all \ngenders.  Community -based advocates will not report unless you request them to do \nso and if you sign a release of information.  \n \nJust Detention International Headquarters is a national advocacy resource and can be \nreached at:  \n3325 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 340  \nLos Angeles, CA  90010  \n \nIf you have any other questions regarding PREA, you may ask any staff member, write \nthe PREA Compliance Manager at your institution, or you may write:  \n \nE.

Puede informar en persona a cualquier \nmiembro personal a trav\u00e9s de una comunicaci\u00f3n de AIC (adulto bajo custodia) o a trav\u00e9s del sis-\ntema de quejas. Puede llamar a la l\u00ednea directa de PREA, seleccionar el idioma y luego marcar 91 \nde cualquier tel\u00e9fono de AIC.  \n \nPresentaci\u00f3n de un informe PREA an\u00f3nimo  \n \nSi no est\u00e1 seguro de presentar una acusaci\u00f3n ante PREA, puede presentar un informe an\u00f3nimo \ncon una agencia externa.  \n \nPuede escribir a:  \n \nGovernor \u2019s Constituent Services Office  \n900 Court Street NE, Suite 254  \nSalem, Oregon 97301  \n \nPor favor indique al comienzo de su carta, que est\u00e1 presentando una denuncia ante PREA y quiere \npermanecer an\u00f3nimo. La Oficina del Gobernador remitir\u00e1 todas las denuncias an\u00f3nimas al Coor-\ndinador de PREA para garantizar que se complete una investigaci\u00f3n basada en la informaci\u00f3n \nproporcionada.  \n \nVisualizaci\u00f3n/Anuncios de  g\u00e9nero opuesto  \n \nEl personal del g\u00e9nero opuesto se anunciar\u00e1 cuando ingresa a una unidad de vivienda, tocando un \ntimbre. Esto debe hacerse cada vez que cambie el statu quo de la supervisi\u00f3n de g\u00e9nero en una \nunidad de vivienda (si ya hay un miembro del personal del sexo opuesto en la unidad, entonces \nno es necesario volver a anunciar). Cuando escuche el timbre, el personal del sexo opuesto estar\u00e1 \ningresando a la unidad de vivienda, as\u00ed que aseg\u00farese de estar cubierto adecuadamente.  \n \nTambi\u00e9n es importante que se desnude en los lugares apropiados. Si se encuentra en un \u00e1rea de \nliteras, hay c\u00e1maras en toda la instalaci\u00f3n. Existen \u00e1reas designadas para cambiarse, el ba\u00f1o es la \n\u00fanica \u00e1rea en la que puede estar sin ropa interior. La visualizaci\u00f3n de sexo opuesto puede ocurrir \nincidentalmente cuando el personal realiza controles de celda de rutina. Puede minimizar esto \nsiendo consciente del g\u00e9nero de la supervisi\u00f3n en su unidad de vivienda y asegur\u00e1ndose de cu-\nbrirse cuando sea posible.  \n \nPrograma de defensa (apoyo) basado en la comunidad PREA  \n \nODOC se ha asociado con defensores confidenciales basados en la comunidad de v\u00edctimas de \nabuso sexual para brindar servicios a los AIC.  \n \n \nPage 20 Los AIC en ODOC que han pasado por abuso sexual pueden comunicarse con un defensor co-\nmunitario seleccionando un idioma, ingresando su PIN de AIC, luego presionando 0*711 siste-\nmas telef\u00f3nicos. Tambi\u00e9n pueden solicitar una llamada privada a trav\u00e9s del Gerente de Cumpli-\nmiento de PREA en la instalaci\u00f3n. Los defensores brindan a las v\u00edctimas de abuso sexual infor-\nmaci\u00f3n sobre sus opciones, recursos, y apoyo emocional. No hay ning\u00fan cargo por las llamadas \na los defensores.  \n \nLa l\u00ednea de crisis de defensa basada en la comunidad es para personas que necesitan ayuda acer-\nca de los problemas relacionados con el abuso sexual y no debe usarse para otros fines.  \n \nLas llamadas telef\u00f3nicas y el correo con los centros de defensa basados en la comunidad se con-\nsideran comunicaciones privilegiadas y se manejar\u00e1n de manera similar a las llamadas legales/\ncorreo oficial.
