Different image \nmethodologies as Positron Emission To mography, Single Photon Emission \nTomography, X Rays or Magnetic Res onance Imaging are in continuous \nevolution to satisfy the increasing dema nds of current medical diagnosis. \nProgress in these methodologies h as been favored by the parallel \ndevelopment of increasingly po werful contrast agents. These are \nmolecules that enhance the intrinsic co ntrast of the images in the regions \nwhere they accumulate, improving both sensi tivity and specificity in the \ndiagnosis. The contrast agent field is also evolving to improve the \nperformance of these molecules usin g the novel approaches that modern \nNanotechnology offers. In this thesis, I will describe novel generations of \nadvanced contrast agents with multimodal imagin g applications based in \nnanotechnology developments. Chap ter 1 introduces the different \nimaging modalities used in clinic and the first generation of contrast \nagents used. Chapter 2 presents a syst ematic study and evaluation of a \nnovel nanoparticulate contrast agent useful in Magnetic Resonance \nImaging measurements of tumor perfusion and immune response. \nChapter 3 describes the development of a new theragnostic composition \nbased in liposomes containing both, a therapeutic molecule and an \nimaging biomarker. The efficacy of this new formulation is validated \nusing different animal models of co lonic inflammation and cancer and a \nvariety of imaging techniques. Fina lly, in Chapter 4 I develop and \nimplement a new anisotropic contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging based in the unusua l magnetic properties of Carbon Nanotubes. \nI characterize their magnetic proper ties and their potential use as \nadvanced anisotropic contrast agents.  In summary, in this work I \npropose, develop and evaluate a sec ond generation of nanoparticulate \ncontrast agents and their potential appl ications in advanced multimodal \nimaging. \n   vii \n Resumen \nLas distintas modalidades de Imag en Cl\u00ednica han alcanzado una gran \nimportancia en el diagn\u00f3stico m\u00e9dico  y en el manejo cl\u00ednico de los \npacientes durante las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas.  Las diferentes metodolog\u00edas de \nimagen m\u00e9dica como Tomograf\u00eda por Emisi\u00f3n de Positrones, Tomograf\u00eda \npor Emisi\u00f3n de Fot\u00f3n \u00danico, Rayos X o Imagen por Resonancia Magn\u00e9tica \nhan estado en continuo desarrollo para satisfacer la creciente demanda de diagn\u00f3stico m\u00e9dico. El progreso de estas metodolog\u00edas se ha visto \nfavorecido por el desarrollo en paralelo de agentes de contraste m\u00e1s potentes y eficaces. Estas mol\u00e9culas au mentan el contraste intr\u00ednseco de \nlas im\u00e1genes en las regiones donde se acumulan aumentando tanto la \nsensibilidad como la especificidad en el diagn\u00f3stico. El campo de los \nagentes de contraste est\u00e1 actualmente en continua evoluci\u00f3n aprovechando en las nuevas op ortunidades que ofrece la \nNanotecnolog\u00eda. En esta tesis, descri bir\u00e9 nuevos agentes de contraste \ncon aplicaciones en imagen multimodal  basados en recientes desarrollos \nnanotecnol\u00f3gicos. El Cap\u00edtulo 1 pr esenta las diferentes modalidades de \nimagen usadas en cl\u00ednica y la primera generaci\u00f3n de agentes de \ncontraste. El Cap\u00edtulo 2 describe el est udio sistem\u00e1tico y la evaluaci\u00f3n de \nun nuevo agente de contraste nanopa rticulado \u00fatil en medidas de \nperfusi\u00f3n tumoral y respuesta in munol\u00f3gica mediante Imagen por \nResonancia Magn\u00e9tica. El Cap\u00edtulo 3 presenta el desarrollo de una nueva \ncomposici\u00f3n teragn\u00f3stica basada en liposomas que contienen tanto una \nmol\u00e9cula terap\u00e9utica como un biomarcador para imagen m\u00e9dica. La eficacia de esta nueva formulaci\u00f3n se comprueba mediante una variedad de t\u00e9cnicas de imagen y con diferentes mo delos animales de inflamaci\u00f3n \ny c\u00e1ncer. Finalmente, en el Cap\u00edtulo 4, describe el desarrollo y caracterizaci\u00f3n de un nuevo agente de  contraste anisotr\u00f3pico para \nImagen por Resonancia Magn\u00e9tica que  aprovecha las extraordinarias \npropiedades magn\u00e9ticas de los Nanotub os de Carbono. En el cap\u00edtulo, se \ninvestigan sus propiedades magn\u00e9ti cas y su potencial utilizaci\u00f3n como \nagentes de contraste avanzados  de naturaleza anisotr\u00f3pica. En resumen, \nen este trabajo se desarrolla, caracteriza y eval\u00faa una nueva generaci\u00f3n de agentes de contraste nanoparticula dos y sus aplicaciones en t\u00e9cnicas \nde imagen multimodal.   ix \n Index  \nChapter 1 .................................................................................................... 1 \nIntroduction ............................................................................................... 1 \n1.1.

Multimodal Molecular Imaging \nBiomedical images originate from the interaction between an \nelectromagnetic radiation and the biological specimen. The \nelectromagnetic spectrum (Figure 1.1) spans from the shortest wavelengths and highest energies associa ted to the cosmic rays to the \nlongest wavelengths and lowest energies associated to the heating \nradiation. The \u03b3-radiation , X-rays, ultraviolet, visi ble and infrared lights, \nmicro- or radiofrequency waves and al so heat, lay in between these two \nextremes.\n \nFigure 1.1. The electromagnetic spectrum expressed as energy (top) or \nassociated wavele ngth (bottom). \nThe middle panel shows some of the initial \nimages obtained from each modality in cluding radiofrequency (MRI) [1], infrared \n[2], X-Rays [3], and \u03b3-rays (PET) [4].  \nNuclear medicine approaches involve the use of highly penetrating \u03b3- and \nx-ray radiations, generating  high sensitivity (10-12 M) images with limited \nresolution (mm). Optical images may become very sensitive (10-15M), as \nin microscopy, but their penetration capacity within the biological \n4 \n specimen is limited in vivo (mm) an d only, very thin objects or highly \nsuperficial processes, can be imaged.  Finally, radiofrequency imaging \nprovides excellent penetration capacity and resolution ( \u00b5m), at the \nexpense of very limited sensitivity (10-3M). Taken together, these \nconsiderations suggest that there is no single optimal imaging modality, \nall of them presenting advantages and limitations. This provides a sound \nbasis to combine the different imaging modalities in a hybrid manner to \nobtain a single multimodal image in cluding the information derived from \nthe different modalities, thus overcom ing the specific limitations of each \nmodality with the advantag es of the others [5].  \nThe physical interaction between the radiation and the specimen \ninvolves most of the times, its tran smittance though the biological \nmedium and the detection of the transm itted radiation across the object \nwith suitable detectors [6]. This is the case of optical imaging and nuclear \nimaging. The image generated follow s then the Lambert-Beer Law \n Eq. 1.1 \nwhere  is the intensity of the image detected,  the intensity of the \nradiation source before the interaction, \n is the extinction coefficient \nrevealing the density of the specimen towards the transmitted radiation \nin a unit of length and d the distance travelled by the radiation through \nthe object. In the case of nuclear imagin g, the source of radiation is \ninside the specimen and decays rap idly with time because of the \nradioactive decay law, so corrections ne ed to be done to account for this 5 \n circumstance, particularly in the case of positron emitters with very short \nhalf-lives.  \nIn general, a planar image is obtai ned after detecting the transmitted \nradiation either with a digital camera in  the case of optical imaging, or \nthrough a coronal array of highly effi cient scintillation detectors in \nnuclear imaging [6, 7]. The reconstruct ion process, normally used in X-\nrays and nuclear medicine approaches, was first proposed by Godfrey \nHounsfield and plays a fundamental role  in nuclear imaging [8]. Since \nthen a variety of reconstruction algorithms have been proposed with \nincreasing resolution and com puting time efficiency [9]. \nThe discovery of Magnetic Resonance Imaging disclosed a completely \nnew imaging strategy, not based on the transmittance phenomenon [1]. \nRather, it took advantage of new physical interaction, based in the \nmagnetic properties of biological  nuclei in the sample and how they \ninteract with static and dynamic extern al magnetic fields. The method \nused non-ionizing radiation and p resented improved resolution when \ncompared to nuclear medicine and in vivo  optical imaging approaches, at \nthe expense of a more limited sensitivi ty. More details on this method \nare provided in the next sections. \nDespite the intrinsic image contrast determined by the physical \nproperties of the tissues, the use of exogenous contrast enhancing \nmolecules has been generalized in all imaging modalities [10-14]. These \nmolecules are designed to enhance selectively and sensitively the intensity of the images  in regions of tissue presenting particular 6 \n physiological, cellular or molecular properties, favoring enormously the \nrecent development of the molecular and cellular imaging field [15].  \nThe initial contrast agents were chemicals with subnanometric \ndimensions active in the different regions of the electromagnetic \nspectrum. Briefly, periodinated benzenes, Gadolinium chelates and 99mTc \nderivatives were among the first co ntrast agents used in X-ray, MRI, and \nnuclear medicine, respectively [11, 16, 17]. More recently, \nnanostructured materials have show n improved resolution and \nsensitivity properties with respect to the classical chemicals, as well as capacity to operate as multifun ctional diagnostic and therapeutic \n(theragnostic) agents, thus opening a new horizon for the applications of \nnanotechnology in biomedi cal imaging [18, 19]. \nIn this thesis I will describe new generations of nanostructured contrast \nagents with improved performance in Magnetic Resonance Imaging and \nthe potential use as theragnostic drugs. First, I will describe the \nfundamentals of Magnetic Resonance an d Magnetic Resonance Imaging. \nSecond, I will present a new superparamagnetic nanoparticle with improved pharmacokinetic properties, able to generate high quality images of tumoral perfusion. Third, I will investigate the encapsulation in \nliposomes of superparamagnetic  nanoparticles , rhodamine-100 \n(rhodamine-100 chloride) and / or omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid \nethyl ester to evaluate their effi cacy as a novel anti-inflammatory \ntheragnostic agent. Finally, I will implement the use of single wall and multiwall carbon nanotubes, as molecul ar anisotropy probes able to \nencode directionality in MRI images.  7 \n 1.1.1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging \nThe Magnetic Resonance Phenomenon \nMRI techniques are based on the out standing physical properties of the \nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) phenomenon, as described by Felix Bloch [20] and Edward Mills Purcell [ 21] in 1946. This phenomenon is \nbased on the fact that nuclei inside a magnetic field absorb \nelectromagnetic radiation at a speci fic frequency, emitting the same \nradiation after the relaxation of the nuc lei occurs [22, 23]. The frequency \nof this radiation depends on the magn etic field applied to the nuclei \nbeing excited. Not all nuclei present  this phenomenon. It is necessary for \nthe nuclei to have a non-zero spin va lue (an intrinsic quantum property) \nwhich leads in a non-zero magnetic moment (\n) with a gyromagnetic \nratio ( ). Thus, a nucleus like 1H presents NMR absorption, while 18O does \nnot present it. Due to the quantum nature of the spin ( ), the magnetic \nmoment presents only certain allo wed values, depending on the \nmagnetic quantum number m. So the z component of the magnetic \nmoment of a nucleus is given by: \n Eq. 1.2 \nwhere  is the Planck constant divided by 2\u03c0 (the z component refers to \nthe magnetization vector S along the direction of the static magnetic field \nB0). If we introduce the nucleus in a magn etic field, the next expression \nfor the energy of this system applies: \n Eq. 1.3 8 \n For a two spin state ( ) nucleus like the 1H, the difference in \nenergy between the stationary state and the excited state is given by: \n Eq. 1.4 \nAnd, since the difference in energy between two nuclear states is given \nby  \n Eq. 1.5 \nthe frequency of the radiation needed to excite the nuclei and induce a \ntransition (as well as the frequency of the radiation emitted in the \ncorresponding relaxation process) is given by \n Eq. 1.6 \nEach nucleus presents a characteristic gyromagnetic ratio so the \nresonance frequency is specific for every nucleus even if placed in the same magnetic field. This characteristic resonance frequency is known as \nthe Larmor frequency. \nOnce the nuclei have been excited, the magnetization acquired is \neventually lost to the surroundings ma inly through two magnetic \nrelaxation processes, longitud inal or spin-lattice (T\n1) and transversal or \nspin-spin (T 2) relaxation. The T 1 process (Figure 1.2) determines the 9 \n relaxation occurring in the z-axis, while the T 2 process (Figure 1.3) \ndetermines the magnetic relaxation in the x-y plane.  \n \nFigure 1.2. Scheme of T 1 relaxation.  When the sample is excited with an RF \npulse (left), some of the spins change thei r orientation and energy, resulting in a \nnet decrease of the longit udinal magnetization comp onent (center). When the \npulse is turned off, the m agnetization recovers to its original equilibrium value \n(right) with a time constant T 1. \nThe relaxation processes implies the loss of the magnetization acquired \nduring the excitation process to the surroundings (lattice, in the T 1 \nprocess) or to other nuclei (spin-spin, T 2). \n \nFigure 1.3. Scheme of T 2 relaxation. When the sample is excited with an RF \npulse (left), the excited spins precess in phase, resulting in the appearance of net \ncoherent transversal magnetiz ation (center). When the pul se is turned off, the \ntransversal magnetization loses coherence  progressively and returns to its zero \nequilibrium value (right).  \nField inhomogeneities may result in additional deph asing of the spins in \nthe x-y plane in a process known as T 2*. In the presence of field \ninhomogeneities, as it happ ens in biological tissues, T 2* is always smaller \nthan T 2. \n10 \n Magnetic Resonance Imaging \nMagnetic resonance imaging obtains im ages from biological objects by \nencoding the magnetization of every pixel in the three spatial \ncoordinates x, y and z. This is do ne through the application of field \ngradients that encode the z and x co ordinates as frequency dependent \nand the y coordinate as a phase d ependence [1]. Briefly, the three \ndimensional localization of every pi xel is encoded using either field or \nphase gradients \n Eq. 1.7 \n Eq. 1.8 \nOne of the most commonly used sequ ences is the spin-echo sequence \n(Figure 1.4). The sequence consist of two sequential radiofrequency pulses, the first one  is used to exci te the sample while the second one is \nused to rephase the protons in the x-y plane (these pulses are separated \nby a time known as echo time TE/2, where TE is the time between the \nfirst pulse and the maximal echo signal). The spin-echo sequence is repeated for every value of the phase enco ding gradient with a delay \ntime known as repetition time, TR, used to recover the longitudinal \nmagnetization before th e next pulse train. 11 \n  \nFigure 1.4. Spin-echo sequence.  The top trace corresponds to the \nradiofrequency pulse train ( \u03c0/2, \u03c0, echo) and the lower ones to the slice \nselection gradient (next to top), the va riable phase encoding gradient (middle) \nand the readout gradient of the echo (bottom trace). TE is the time between the \n/2 pulse and the echo and TR is the  time between two successive \n /2 pulses.  \nThe different echo signals S obtained in the time domain for every value \nof the phase gradient (k space), are digitized and transformed \nbidimensionally into a frequency ma p (the image) using the Fourier \nTransform theorem: \n Eq. 1.9 \nwhere  is the signal intensity in the frequency domain and the \nsignal intensity (microvolts) in the time domain. \nThe signal intensity  obtained in every pixel after the Fourier \nTransformation follows the equation \n12 \n  Eq. 1.10  \nwhere  is the spin density, TE the echo time, TR the repetition time , T 1 \nthe longitudinal relaxation time and T 2 the transversal relaxation time \n[22]. It is possible to weight the si gnal intensity of the pixel in T 1, T2 or \n  \nchoosing the proper pulsing conditions. Using, very short TE (much \nshorter than T 2) and TR values shorter than T 1, the image is said to be \ndominated by the T 1 relaxation terms, or \u201cweighted in T 1\u201d. Using very \nlong TRs (longer than T 1) and TE values in the range of T 2, the image \nobtained is said to be dominated by the T 2 term, or \u201cweighted in T 2\u201d. \nFinally, using very long TR values (much longer than T 1) and very short TE \nvalues (much shorter than T 2), the T 1 and T 2 influences are minimized and \nthe image is said to be weighted in proton density (\n ). \n1.1.2. Optical Imaging \nOptical Imaging is a technique that permits the measurement of light \nproduced in vivo by fluorescence or  bioluminescence mechanisms. It is a \nnon-invasive procedure with low resolu tion but with high sensitivity [24, \n25]. \nThis effect is based in the luminescence effect where some chemical \ncompounds absorb radiation and pr oduce then light of a well-known \nfrequency. A usual chemical compound u sed in this technique is luminol \nwhich in presence of myeloperoxid ase or iron complex as catalysts \nsuffers a reaction generating chemiluminis cence [26, 27]. This effect is \nused in detecting infla mmations (Figure 1.5). 13 \n  \nFigure 1.5. Representative biolumin escence images obtained after the \nadministration of luminol.  Two mice subjected to so dium dextran sulfate \n(DSS) intoxication are invest igated, one of them injecte d with luminol (left) and \nthe other one without the optical agent (right). Note how inflammatory disease \ntriggers myeloperoxidase expression in the neutrophils and the formation of \nbioluminescent derivative of luminol [24, 26].  \nThe optical approach has been reinfo rced recently with the development \nof transgenic mice, carrying the luci ferase promoter coupled to specific \ngenes activated by inflammation (N FkappaB) or cancer (VEGF) [28, 29]. \nThese mice, express the luciferase gene, every time the coupled gene is \nexpressed, and consequently emit li ght spontaneously if luciferin is \nadministered [30]. \n  \n14 \n 1.1.3. Ionizing Radiation Imaging \nX-Rays \nThe potential use of X-Rays as a to ol in clinical imaging was first \ndiscovered by Wihelm R\u00f6ntgen at the end of 19th century [3]. A high \nenergetic electron beam emits radiation when the electrons are stopped. This is known as Bremsstrahlung radi ation and has the enough energy to \ngo through biological tissues being more attenuated by tissues containing \nlarge quantities of electron dense metals as calcium (as the bones or calcified lesions). So, if the tissue under study is accommodated between \nthe electron beam source and a pho tograph film, images of bones or \nother electron dense tissues or implants can be obtained easily. Nowadays, X-Rays devices have evolved to obtain three-dimensional images or applied kinetically \u201con li ne\u201d to measure transit times of the \ncontrast agent in fluoroscopy studies [6, 31, 32]. \nNuclear Radiation Imaging \nThe development of new nuclear technologies and accelerators permit the manipulation of the energy levels of the nucleus to release radiations \nof high energy, known as gamma rays. Gamma rays are more energetic \nthan X-Rays and go through biological  tissue with low attenuation. Using \ncyclotrons it is possible to synt hesize radiopharmaceuticals with high \ntissue specificity, emitting gamma pho tons only from the target tissue. \nSPECT (Single Photon Emission Co mputed Tomography) was the first \ndevice developed using this te chnology. The most common \nradiopharmaceutical used in SPECT \n99mTc attached to a molecule \n(normally an antibody) with high specificity causing an accumulation of \nthe radiopharmaceutical in a specific tissue (e.g., tumoral tissue). 99mTc 15 \n emits one photon of 140 keV for each disintegration (the half-life of 99mTc \nis around 6 hours) which is recoll ected and visualized with a gamma \ncamera compound by scintillation detectors, many times based in sodium iodide crystals doped with thallium (NaI(Tl)). A 3D software \nreconstructs the distribution of the photons allowing the spatial localization of the radiopharmaceutical emitter. PET (Positron Emission \nTomography) is another te chnique of Nuclear Radi ation Imaging. In this \ncase, the radiopharmaceutical used em its positrons which are \nannihilated with electrons emitting  two 511 keV gamma photons, in \nopposite directions. These photons ar e collected in a detector ring \ncontaining specialized gamma cameras (based most frequently on \nlutetium oxyorthosilicate LSO cry stals) which surrounds the object, \nanimal or patient. Because the emission of two photons occurs in \nopposite directions, the reconstruction software works with the \ncoincidence of the detection to locate the original site of positron \nemission. The PET technique prese nts, because of the higher energies \ninvolved, higher resolution than SPE CT, but remains limited by the \nshorter half-life of the PET radiopharmaceuticals as compared to SPECT. Both techniques depict very high sensi tivity, albeit low resolution, and \nare heavily used in cell tracking and tumo r detection [33, 34] (Figure 1.6).  16 \n  \nFigure 1.6. Representative PET imag e of a patient obtained after 18F-2-\ndeoxyglucose ad ministration.  Organs that take most contrast are brain, \nheart or bladder. It is possible to de tect clearly a tumor in the liver (arrow) \n(taken from [33]).  \n1.2. Contrast Agents \nContrast agents are molecules active in  the different frequencies of the \nelectromagnetic spectrum able to enhance in the image particular \nregions of the imaged subject, in  which they accumulate. Their \naccumulation is able to reveal specific receptor activations, different \ncellular or molecular processes, the extension of lesions and their pathophysiological properties or the response to therapies. The first \ngeneration of contrast agents involved small molecules with diameters \nmuch smaller than 1 nm [11]. \n17 \n In the nuclear medicine field, a large variety of SPECT or PET tracers \nhaven been proposed, with dominant  applications in oncologic and \nneurodegenerative diseases. In general, PET or SPECT tracers contain two parts, a targeting moiety providing the selectivity to the imaged process \nand a radionuclide moiety, containing  the radionuclide emitting gamma \nrays with 140 meV (SPECT) or 511 meV (PET) enabling the detection. The \ntargeting moieties are vectorial reag ents, including either small chelates \nor even peptides, proteins or antibodies with molecular specificity for the \ndesired target [35]. The radionuclides involve mainly \n99mTc, 68Ga, 111In or \n131I for SPECT or 18F, 11C, 15O for PET. \nA large variety of SPECT probes are commercially available to monitor \nmost frequently perfusion [ 36], hypoxia [37], inflammation [38], thyroid \nfunction [39] or even cerebral acti vation [40]. Their main advantage is \nthe possibility to use relatively lo w cost gamma cameras for detection, \navailable in many hospitals and the relatively long half-lives of the SPECT \nemitters (in the hour range), while their main limitation is the reduced \nresolution of the SPECT method [5, 6]. This limitation is overcome in large \npart through the use of PET probes which offer increase spatial and \ntemporal resolution, at the expense of the more expensive PET equipment and the reduced half-life (i n the min range) of the positron \nemitters. \n18F-2-deoxiglucose (FDG) is prob ably the most widely used PET \ntracer, despite its poor selectivity. FDG is taken up by virtually all tissues \nin an analogous manner to glucose, but  it is not degraded by glycolysis, \nresulting in FDG accumulation in tho se regions with enhanced glucose \ntransport. FDG reveals spectacularly the presence of tumors or metastases, regions of cerebral activati on or even inflammatory lesions, 18 \n providing probably  the most successful tracer in nuclear medicine. \nHowever, since glucose uptake is a universal process, the use of FDG is \nhampered by its lack of selectivity, making very difficult to discriminate tumoral from inflamed regions, resulti ng in a non-negligible number of \nfalse positives (up to 30% [41] ) and requiring in many cases \ncomplementary examinations wi th other tracers or modalities.  \nContrast agents for MRI, involve main ly Gd(III) chelates, able to enhance \nwater relaxation in those tissues where they accumulate [11]. Gd(III) is used because it has seven unpaired, slow  relaxing electrons, and depicts \nthe largest magnetic moment among the rare earth series. The ligands \nmost frequently used are linear chelates derived from diethylendiamino \npentaacetic acid (DTPA) or cyclic chel ates derived from the tetra-aza-\nmacrocycles or cyclen derivatives (DOTA). In all these cases, the ligand \nprovides eight binding sites anchori ng the Gd(III), leaving free one the \nnine chelating sites of the metal, for water contact. The contact between \nwater in the solution or tissue wi th the Gd(III), and the fast exchange of \nthis water molecule with the bulk soluti on, reduces very significantly the \nrelaxation times of the tissue, resulti ng in clearly enhanced image \nintensity in those regions containi ng the chelate [11]. The use of other \nlanthanides as Dy(III), may transfo rm the same chelates in T\n2 enhancing \nprobes, due to the inherent T 2 relaxing properties of Dy(III) [42]. \nCurrently there are no specific co ntrast agents to enhance T 2*. In this \nthesis, I will provide an interesting alternative for this purpose. \nMRI includes additionally a large v ariety of molecules able to enhance \nimage intensity using o ther mechanisms including mainly magnetization \ntransfer methods [43]. These agents are known as diamagnetic Chemical 19 \n Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) or Paramagnetic Chemical Exchange \nSaturation Transfer (PARACEST) agent s. These molecules can be \ncustomized to reveal important asp ects of the lesions including \nproperties of the microenvironment as pH [44], monovalent or divalent \nion concentration [45] or te mperature [46], among others. \nSuperparamagnetic iron oxide nano particles have been implemented \nmore recently to increase the relaxi ng capacity of the paramagnetic \nchelates [47-49]. These particles contain a magnetite core (Fe 3O4) core, \ncovered most frequently by a dextran or lipid coat. The particles are \nprepared by alkaline precip itation of mixtures of Fe3+ and Fe2+ in the \npresence of stabilizing agents as dext ran or oleic acid. These depict \nenormous relaxivity values, as co mpared to the Gd(III) chelates, allowing \nfor a significant increase in the sensivity  for MRI detection. This is due to \nthe fact that the cooperative alignment of the magnetic moments from \nthe iron ions in the superparamagnetic nanoparticles, results in \nsignificantly larger magnetic moment s than the additive alignment of the \nparamagnetic Gd(III) moments. Sup erparamagnetic behavior results \nmainly in T 2 enhancement, in contrast  with the paramagnetic T 1 \nenhancement, of the Gd(III) chelates. Littl e information exist of the T 2* \nrelaxing capacity of these particles [23]. In this thesis, I will describe a \nnew iron-based nanoparticle coated with a polymer of acrylic acid, able \nto generate excellent T 2* contrast. \nFinally, an ample collection of optical probes emitting fluorescence, \nluminescence or near infrared  radiation, have been described [50-52]. \nThese probes are limited by the redu ced penetration in tissues of the \noptical wavelengths, but are well endow ed to image small animals as 20 \n mice or cells, using the new generation  of CCD (Charge Coupled Devices) \ncameras and optical scanners. Howe ver, the performance of these \nprobes is supported by their excellent selectivity to respond to very specific molecular processes, as protease activation [51], angiogenesis \n[53] or inflammation [54]. \nThe advent of Nanotechnology has pr ovided a collection of new tools \nand formulations that may overcome the limitations of the first \ngeneration of contrast agents (Figure 1.7). Basically, the use of \nnanoparticles, decorated with vectorial molecules as antibodies or \npeptides may increase sign ificantly the molecular selectivity of contrast \nagents, otherwise non selective, and the use of liposomal formulations \nmay allow to combine probes for di fferent imaging modalities in the \nsame vehicle, or even add a therapeutic molecule. Moreover, these novel \nformulations are expected to decrea se the dose of administered contrast \nrequired for successful imaging, sin ce most of the non-selective contrast \nagents currently administered, go to uninteresting subject regions or \nbecome eliminated. Nanotechnology has open then a new era in the \ncontrast agent field, optimizing the detection by imaging of the contrast agent and eventually combinin g the diagnostic and therapeutic \npotentials by adding a therapeutic ag ent to the same nanotechnological \nplatform, to produce the new generations of  \u201ctheragnostic agents\u201d. \nFigure 1.7 presents some of the most commonly used nanoparticle \nformulations. Solid na noparticles (or powders) may be produced of \nvarying sizes, by the spray-drying me thod, allowing for the encapsulation \nof drugs and contrast agents for oral  delivery, in most cases. To this end 21 \n normally, poli-lactic-glut amic nanoparticles (PLGA) are used for oral or \nrectal administration [55]. \nLipid nanoparticles, liposomes [56,  57] and micelles [58], provide \nexcellent platforms to administer co mbinations of co ntrast agents and \ntherapeutic principles, in intravenous ad ministrations. In this thesis, I will \nillustrate this aspect combin ing the use of a novel iron-oxide nanoparticle \nwith an anti-inflammatory agent, to  obtain strong theragnostic agent \nwith anti-inflammatory and antitumoral effects. \nFinally, the use of graphene structures has recently been added to the \narray of nanotechnology platforms, to administer contrast agents, \ncombining imaging pr obes and therapeutic agents. Gd(III) atoms have \nbeen included in fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. However, the \nmagnetic properties of these arra ngements and their use as contrast \nagents, remains nowadays insufficiently cha racterized. In this thesis, I will \ndescribe the magnetic properties of single-wall and multi-wall carbon \nnanotubes as novel nanoprob es for anisotropic MRI. 22 \n  \nFigure 1.7. The development of recent nanotechnology approaches has \ndriven the creation of new fami lies of imaging contrast agents.  Classic \ncontrast agents as Gd(III) DOTA  are now competing with newer, more sensitive \nand more selective, contrast agents based on  PLGA nanoparticles (top left), SPIO \nnanoparticles (top center), Lipid Nanoparticles (top right), Quantum Dots (bottom left), Dendrimers (bottom cen ter)s or Graphene structures (bottom \nright).\n \n  \n23 \n  \n \n \nChapter 2 \nNanotex: a novel superparamagnetic \nnanoparticle to image tissue perfusion by \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging \n \nChapter 2 describes the preparation, \ncharacterization and evaluation of a novel \nsuperparamagnetic nanoparticle as an \nadvanced, low adherence,  superparamagnetic \ncontrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging of tissue or tumoral perfusion. \n  25 \n 2.1. Introduction \nThe effect of chelated paramagnetic meta ls as contrast agents in MRI has \nbeen known since the early 1980\u2019s [22]. Gadolinium, a paramagnetic \nmetal of the rare earth series, b ecame the optimal candidate because its \nlarge magnetic moment, seven unpa ired electrons and their long \nelectronic relaxation time. Howev er, its significant toxicity when \nadministered free precluded its use in the clinic. In 1983, the first \ngadolinium chelate which eliminated the  toxic effect of free gadolinium \nwas proposed, opening the opportunity to use it as a safe contrast agent \nin MRI [11, 59]. Other gadolinium chelates, based on the cyclen structure \nfollowed soon after [11, 60]. Howe ver, the need of high doses of these \nparamagnetic agents to obtain signif icant MR contrast, and the recent \nappearance of toxic responses in so me chelates [61], challenged their \nuse. In the late 80\u2019s,  new generations of more efficient contrast agents \nbased in the use of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, were described \n[47]. The first nanoparticles consisted of a nucleus of magnetite (Fe 3O4) \ncovered by a layer of free or cross-linked dextran. Some of these nanoparticles, as Endorem or Resovist, were shown to depict high relaxing power, be devoid of signif icant toxic effects and thus, became \ncommercialized and used in the clinic soon after [62, 63]. However, the \nfirst generation of superparamagnetic nanoparticles was not free from \nadverse effects. Despite their enormous relaxing power, these \nnanoparticles became trapped by the reticuloendotelial system and \nbecause of the dextran cover, became  unselectively adsorbed over \ncapillary and tissue surfaces, accumu lating in tissues after repeated \nadministrations, thus disadvising fast subsequent administrations [64].  26 \n In this chapter we propose, characterize and evaluate a new \nsuperparamagnetic nanoparticle maintaining the iron oxide core, but covered by a layer of polyacrylic acid.  The nanoparticle depicts improved \nT\n2* relaxation properties, reduced non-speci fic adherence in capillaries \nand tissues, very low splenic accumulation and adequate T 1 and \nT2,relaxation properties, supporting its use as an improved \nsuperparamagnetic contras agent in MRI, with em phasis in perfusion \nimaging.  \n2.2.

Preparation of the Iron Oxide Superparamagnetic \nNanoparticle Nanotex. \nMagnetite (Fe 3O4) nanoparticles were prepared by the co-precipitation \n[65] of Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions (molar ratio 2:1, total Fe 0.3M, 25 0C) with \nammonia (29.6%, pH:10) in an  inert atmosphere, followed by \nhydrothermal treatment (80 0C, 30 min) [66]. The magnetic nanoparticles \nwere washed several times with deioni zed water and ethanol, and dried \nat 70 0C in a furnace for subsequent tr eatment. For the binding of \npolyacrylic acid (PAA), 100 mg of Fe 3O4 nanoparticles were first mixed \nwith 2 ml of buffer A (0.003 M pho sphate, pH 6) and 0.5 ml of \ncarbodiimide solu tion (0.025 g\u00b7mL-1 in buffer A). After being sonicated for \n10 min, 2.5 ml of PAA solution (60 mg\u00b7mL-1 in buffer A) were added and \nthe reaction mixture sonicated (Ultraso nic bath, JP Selecta, Abrera, ES) \nfor an additional 30 min. Finally, the PAA-coated Fe 3O4 nanoparticles \nwere recovered magnetically, washed with water twice and dialyzed 27 \n against a buffer saline solution. In  the following, the resulting \nnanoparticle is named Nanotex. \n2.2.2. Magnetic Relaxation Properties.  \nThe evaluation of magnetic relaxation properties (T 1, T 2 and T 2*) of \nNanotex was investigated using both, a Bruker Minispec system (Bruker \nBiospin, Ettlingen, DE) at 1.5 Tesla, a clinical field strength, and with a \nBruker Pharmascan scanner (Bruker Biospi n, Ettlingen, DE) operating at 7 \nTesla [67]. \nT1 values at 1.5 T were determined with the progressive saturation \nsequence [68], TE: 10 ms, TR: 70-12000 ms (at least 9 values). T 1 values at \n7T were obtained using a spin-echo sequence with TE: 12.62 ms, TR: 150-6000 ms (7 echoes) using coronal sectio ns (1.5 mm) across a collection of \ncapillaries (1mm diameter) containing, each one, increasing \nconcentrations of Nanotex. Acquisition  conditions were; FOV (Field of \nView) 30 mm, matrix size 256x256 pixels. T\n1 values (mean \u00b1 SD) were \ndetermined in T 1 maps calculated by fitting pi xel by pixel the expression \n (where S is the signal value for each TR and S0 the \nvalue for TR=0 ) using the in-house develop ed program MyMap Analyzer \nrunning in a MatLab environ ment (The Mathworks, Natick, \nMassachusetts, USA). T 1 values are expressed in ms as mean \u00b1 standard \ndeviation. \nT2 values (ms) at 1,5 T were obtained (Minispec, Bruker Biospin, \nEttlingen, DE) in the sa me tubes used for T 1 measurements, using a spin-\necho sequence (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gil l) independent of spin diffusion \nwith TR: 9000 s, TE: 10-2000 ms (at least 9 values) [68]. T 2 values at 7T \nwere determined (mean \u00b1 SD) using a spin-echo sequence with TR: 5000 28 \n ms, TE: 12-600 ms (50 echoes), FOV 30 mm, matrix size 256x256 pixels. \nT2 maps were calculated from the collection of T 2 weighted images by \nnon-linear fitting of the pixel intensities to the expression \n (where S is the signal value for each TR and S0 the value for \nTR=0 ). \nT2* maps at 7T were acquired from coronal sections (1,5 mm) across a \ncollection of capillaries (1mm diameter) containing increasing \nconcentrations of Nanotex, using a gradient echo sequence [68], TR: 300 \ns, TE: 2.3-40 ms (at least 9 values), a FOV of 30 mm, matrix size of 256x256 and a coronal section of 1.5 mm [68]. T\n2* values were calculated \nfrom the T 2* maps by non-linear fitting of the pixel intensities to the \nexpression  (where S is the signal value for each TR and \nS0 the value for TR=0 ) using the in-house developed program MyMap \nAnalyzer running in a MatLab envir onment (The Mathworks, Natick, \nMassachusetts, USA). T 2* values are expressed in ms as mean \u00b1 standard \ndeviation. \n2.2.3. Citotoxicity \nThe in vitro  toxicity of Nanotex in C6 gl ioma cell cultures was investigated \nmeasuring the metabolic reduction of MTT (tetrazolium salt) to formazan, a process which evalu ates the potential red-ox and the \nintracellular oxidative metabolism. The cellular viability is directly \nassociated to the reduction of MTT to  formazan, a reaction which only \noccurs in living cells [69]. MTT te st was implemented for C6 incubations \nwith increasing concentrations of Nanote x, and the results expressed as a \npercentage of cell survival.  29 \n 2.2.4. Splenic Accumulation \nSplenic accumulation [70] of Nanotex in vivo  was determined by \nmeasuring T 2* values in spleens isolated from CD1 mice sacrificed one \nhour after intravenous injection of Na notex (15 micromol Fe/kg body \nweight). This dose corresponds to the amount recommended for use in \nthe clinic by commercial nanop article manufacturers and has served as a \nreference dose here. The spleens were isolated from mice killed by \ncervical dislocation and placed in six well Plexiglas plates allowing for \nconstruction of the corresponding T 2* maps. The resolution and \nsensitivity achieved with this method allowed for very precise measurements of T\n2* in spleen ex vivo , not achievable for the spleen in \nvivo. \n2.2.5. Pharmacokinetics \nTo investigate the in vivo  pharmacokinetics of Nanotex by MRI, we \nobtained T 2* weighted images and the corresponding T 2* maps of coronal \nsections across the thorax and abdom en of Swiss CD1 mice, before \nintravenous administration of Nano tex and at increasing times after its \nadministration (1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 168 h) [71]. The Nanotex nanoparticles were administered intravenously as an aqueous solution at a dose of 15 \nmicromol Fe/kg body weight. Thi s dose corresponds to the amount \nrecommended in the clinic by commer cial nanoparticle manufacturers of \nEndorem or Resovist, and has served as a reference dose here. \n2.2.6. Use of Nanotex in MRI Perfusion Imaging \nMicrovascular perfusion was assessed by monitoring kinetically by MRI \nthe passage of a contrast agent \u201cbol us\u201d through a body section (bolus \ntracking method) [72, 73]. Basically, after a very fast injection, the 30 \n contrast agent solution moved thr ough the vasculature as a \u201cbolus\u201d, \nmaintaining the initial concentration of the injected solution in the \nmicrovasculature, at least during its first passage through each tissue. \nWhen the MR imaging plane is reached by the bolus, a decrease in the \nimage intensity is measurable by  MRI that is proportional to the \nconcentration of the in jected agent [74]. \nTo investigate tissue and tumoral perfu sion we used the C6 glioma model \n[75]. Briefly, male adult Sp rague-Daweley rats received 106 C6 cells in the \ncaudate nucleus. Tumors developed during the next two weeks until the \nMRI perfusion measurement took plac e. The kinetics of contrast agent \npassage across the imaging plane, where ac quired using a Bruker Biospec \nscanner (7T, Bruker BIOSPIN, Ettlingen,  DE) with an echoplanar sequence \n(EPI), with TE:10.32 ms and TR: 277,51 ms (150 T 2* images). A bolus of \ncontrast agent (250 \u03bcL of Nanotex, 90 \u03bcmoles Fe/Kg) was injected \nintravenously in the tail vein of Sp rague-Dawley adult male rats (n= 6) \ncarrying implanted C6 glioma 10 seconds after the beginning of the \nacquisition sequence \nThe kinetics of contrast agent p assage through the imaging plane, \napproaches a gamma function with an initial portion, a point of \nmaximum intensity and a decre ase until disappearance. The area under \nthis curve represents the cerebral blood volume (CBV; ml/100g) in the \nimaging plane. The time between the beginning of passage and the \nmaximum concentration is the mean transit time (MTT), a magnitude \nthat measures the time (s) in which half of contrast bolus has passed \nthrough the section. Finally, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) is calculated as 31 \n the CBV/MTT ratio, representing blood flow [(ml/100g)/min] through the \ninvestigated cerebral section in a pixel by pixel manner [74]. \nThe perfusion values (CBV, CBF and MTT) were obtained using the home \nmade program MyMap Analyzer by the  adjustment of the increment of \nT2* relaxivity (\u0394r 2*) to a gamma function. With this adjustment, the \nperfusion values are given by the equations:  \n Eq. 2.1 \n Eq. 2.2 \n Eq. 2.3 \n2.2.7. Evaluation of Nanotex as a CT Contrast Agent \nDue to the high electron density of the iron core of Nanotex, we \nevaluated its potential use as con trast agent in CT (INVEON PET-SPECT-\nCT, Siemens AG, DE). The CT images were taken with a voltage of 80 kV \nand a current of 500 \u03bcA. The exposure time was 220 ms, acquiring 180 projections with a FOV of 57.2 x 57 .2 mm. We obtained an image of X \nRays of different concentrations (25%, 50%, 75% and original sample) of \nNanotex and compared it with that of  a commercial CT contrast agent, \nUltravist (300 mg / mL, Bayer, DE) dissolved in water, placed closely in \nparallel wells of a 96 well plate. The X Ray densitometries obtained were \nanalyzed using the freely av ailable ImageJ package \n(http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/, Nati onal Institutes of Health, Bethesda, \nMaryland, US). 32 \n 2.3. Results \n2.3.1. Prepara tion and Characterization \nThe study of the magnetic relaxation behaviour constitutes an essential \nrequirement in the characterization of  a new contrast agent for Magnetic \nResonance Imaging. Figure 2.1 summ arizes the relaxation properties of \nsolvent water in Nanotex suspensions for T 1 (A, C) and T 2 (B, D) at 1.5 \nTesla in water (top panels) and serum  (bottom panels), in concentrations \nranging from 0 to 0.05 mM Fe.  \n \nFigure 2.1. Magnetic relaxation properties of water in Nanotex \nsuspensions of increasing nanoparticle concentration at 1.5 Tesla.  T1 (A, \nC) and T 2 (B, C) relaxation in water (top) or fetal bovine serum (bottom), in \nconcentrations ranging from 0 to 0.05 mM Fe.  \nNanotex reduces the values of the different water relaxation times, T 1 or \nT2 in a concentration dependent manner. As expected for a \nsuperparamagnetic nanoparticle, the reduction is much larger in T 2 than \n33 \n in T 1.The highest concentration tested reduced T 1 water from 3200 ms to \n2600 ms, and T 2 from 2500 ms to 600 ms, respectively. . In the case of \nserum, a reduction of T 1 from 1800 ms to 1600 ms, and T 2 from 1000 ms \nto 700 ms is observed. The Nanotex effect on T 2 remains higher than in \nT1, but the magnitude is smaller than  that observed in pure water. This \nmay be due either to a reduction in the effective amount of water \navailable for relaxation with the nanoparticle in serum (solvation of \nproteins, carbohydrates and ions in plasma) or to reduction of the free \nnanoparticle concentration in wat er due to binding to plasma \ncomponents. \n \nFigure 2.2. Magnetic relaxation properties of water in Nanotex \nsuspensions of increasing Fe concentration at 7 Tesla.  T2 (A, C) and T 2* \n(B,D) relaxation values at 7 Tesla in wa ter (top) and fetal bovine serum (bottom) \nof Nanotex suspensions in concentrations ranging from  0 to 0.05 mM Fe. Values \nrepresent the mean \u00b1 SD of the pixels  from a coronal plane taken across the \ncapillaries for each condition.  \nNanotex reduced the T 2 value of water from 300 ms to 220 ms in water \nand from 159 ms to 133 ms in serum, respectively. T 2* reductions by \n34 \n Nanotex were to 18 ms in water and 10  ms in serum, respectively.  Again, \nthe reductions observed in T 2 and T 2*, were smaller in serum than in \nwater, supporting the association of  the nanoparticle to serum \ncomponents in a way that decreases its relaxing capacity. These results \nwere compared with those obtained wi th a commercial nanoparticulate \ncontrast agent, Endorem (11.2 mg  Fe / mL, Guerbet, FR) under the same \nconditions (Table 2.1).  \nTable 2.1. Comparison of r 1, r2 and r 2* relaxivity values  of Nanotex and \nEndorem suspensions in water and serum mea sured at 7 Tesla. \n \n r1 (mM-1\u00b7s-1) a) r2 (mM-1\u00b7s-1) a) r2* (mM -1\u00b7s-1) a) \nNanoparticle Water Serum Water Serum Water Serum \nEndorem 1.1044 0.922 103.55 66.49 298.88 159.93 \nNanotex 0.5524 0.4951 88.971 94.163 97.334 119.78 \na)Relaxivity values were determined at 22 0C as the slope of the linear increase in 1/T 1, \n1/T 2 or 1/T 2* values with Nanotex or Endorem concentrations (0 - 0.05 mM [Fe]). \n \nTable 2.1 summarizes the comparative relaxivity values measured in \nserum or water. The r 1 and r 2* relaxivity values of Nanotex were smaller \nthan those of Endorem in water and serum, but r 2 of Nanotex reached a \nhigher value than Endorem in serum.  These results imply a significant \nadvantage of Nanote x over Endorem when us ing imaging sequences \nweighted in T 2 in vascular imaging. \n2.3.2. Toxicity Evaluation in Cell Cultures and in vivo  \nRodent Models \nAn evaluation of the potential cytotoxic effects of a new contrast agent is \nnecessary to support its safety profil e and potential applications in the \nclinic. The contrast agent should present reduced or absent cytotoxicity 35 \n and reduced tissue accumulation, allowi ng for multiple administrations \nwithout significant accumulations in  specific tissues as the spleen.  \nFigure 2.3 shows the results of MTT reduction from C6 cells versus \nincreasing concentrations of Nanotex or  Endorem after 1 hour (A) and 24 \nhour (B) of incubation.   Changes in cell viability are hardly detectable \nthroughout the concentration range in vestigated, suggest ing negligible \ncellular toxicity of Nanotex or End orem in glioma C6 cell cultures. A \npositive control (a cytotoxic concentration of hydroxylamine) was employed to confirm that viable cells  can be killed, and that cell killing \nand survival can be detected by the MTT reduction assay. \n \nFigure 2.3. Comparative study of cyto toxicity of Nano tex and Endorem. \nEffect of increasing concentrations of Na notex and Endorem on C6 cell viability \ndetected by MTT reduction assay, after 1h  (left) or 24h (right) incubation. \nHydroxylamaine was used  as a toxic control.  \n \nThe next step in the development a new contrast agent development is \nto assess the in vivo  toxicity. To this end, CD1 mice were injected with 15 \nmicromol Fe/kg body weight of Nanotex or Endorem. This dose corresponds to the recommended dose in the clinic by commercial Endorem manufacturers and has serv ed as a reference dose here. Figure \n2.4 shows representative results of a s tudy of accumulation of these \n36 \n nanoparticles in spleens isolated from  different animals receiving either \nNanotex (n=3), Endorem (n=2) or saline (n=1). \nNanotex accumulation was then invest igated through the analysis of T2* \nrelaxation in ex vivo  spleens of CD1 mice one hour after the injection. \nAccumulation of the nanoparticles in this organ may cause a spleen \nfailure and represent a clear symptom of toxicity. The resolution and \nsensitivity achieved with this ex vivo  MRI method allows very precise \nmeasurements of T 2* in spleen, not achieva ble for the mouse spleen \nunder in vivo  conditions. \n \nFigure 2.4. Splenic accumulation of di fferent iron oxide nanoparticles as \ndetected by T 2* weighted MRI.  Six spleens (A-F) from  mice, obtained one \nhour after the intravenous injection of  Endorem (A, B), Nanotex (C, D, E) or \nsaline (F). The doses of both contrast agents were 15 micromol Fe/kg body \nweight. \nFigure 2.4 shows representative results of this study of Fe accumulation \nfrom injected nanoparticles in the spl een of two animals injected with \n37 \n Endorem, three animals injected with Nanotex and a control. Note that \nthe spleens from mice receiving Endor em or Nanotex appear darker than \nthe control mouse receiving salin e, as expected for nanoparticle \naccumulation. Moreover, the spleens rec eiving Endorem appear darker \nthan those receiving Nanotex, revealin g relatively lower accumulation of \nNanotex than of Endorem.  \nTable 2.2 provides the quantitative T 2* values of isolated spleens before \nand one hour after intravenous injecti on of Nanotex or Endorem (15 \nmicromol Fe/Kg body weight). Notably, Nanotex did not induce a \nsignificant decrease in splenic T 2*, suggesting a very low or non-existent \nsplenic accumulation and negligible biologi cal adherence. However, \nEndorem induce a d ecrease in splenic T 2* comparable with values \nmeasured with another commercial nanop article, Resovist (Schering, DE), \nwhich induces a splenic T 2* value of 2.11 \u00b1 0.2 ms.  \nTable 2.2. Splenic accumu lation of Nanotex and \nEndorem one hour after intravenous \nadministration of the nano particles as detected by \nthe splenic T 2* value. \n \nCondition Splenic T 2* (ms)a) \nControl (saline) 4.78 \u00b1 0.20 \nNanotex  4.26 \u00b1 0.26 \nEndorem  3.51 \u00b1 0.16 \na) T2* values were determined ex vivo , at 7T (Bruker Pharmascan), \nusing the gradient ec ho sequence in spleen s isolated from CD1 mice \neither before or 1h after nanoparticle administration. 38 \n During the in vivo  studies no appreciable external toxicity signs were \nobserved after the administration of  Nanotex, including the \nadministrations of doses double than  those recommended commercially. \nIn addition, Nanotex was found compatible with the protocol of anaesthesia used (isoflurane 1-2%), without mortality detected due to the nanoparticle in any of  the investigated healthy animals (n= 12). \nMore specifically, the administration  of Nanotex did not induce \nsignificant changes in respiratory or heart rate, no external symptoms of \nhepatotoxicity such as yellowish fur, ha ir or eyes, bald spots,, hyper- or \nhypoactivity (sleepiness), aggressi veness, food and water intake \ndisorders, hemiparesis or hemiplegia. \nThe residence time of the contrast ag ent in the body is another aspect \nthat needs to be characterized in a new contrast agent. It is preferable a \ncontrast agent with short residence tim e, being eliminated from the body \nrapidly, than a contrast agent with long  residence time, thus disadvising \nrepetitive accumulations.  \n \nFigure 2.5. Representative T\n2* MRI of mouse liver in vivo  before (A) and \nafter Nanotex (B) or Endo rem (C) administrations.  Representative T 2* \nweighted images (left) of thorax and abdomen of mice and T 2* maps obtained 24 \nh after intravenous administration of Na notex (center) and E ndorem (right) with \na clinical doses of 15 mi cromol Fe /kg body weight. \n39 \n Figure 2.5 shows representative T 2* weighted images across the \nabdomen and thorax of a control mouse before the administration of nanoparticle suspensions (left), or T\n2* maps obtained 24 h after \nintravenous administration of the same dose of Nanotex (center) or Endorem (left). The T\n2* map (Figure 2.5 center) shows significantly lower \nvalues of T 2* in the livers of animals treated with Nanotex or Endorem, \nconfirming previous results. \nFigure 2.6 summarizes the results of T 2* images acquired at different \ntimes after , after intravenous administrations of single dose (15 micromol Fe/kg body weight) and do uble dose (30 micromol Fe/kg body \nweight) of Nanotex, compared to those obtained after the administration \nof the same doses of Endorem. Na notex induced a slight decrease in \nhepatic T\n2*, with a fast decline followed by rapid clearance from hepatic \ntissue. Meanwhile, Endorem depi cted a higher decrease in T 2* but a \nsignificantly slower clearance kinetics.  Interestingly, the single dose of 15 \nmicromol Fe/kg body weight Nanotex was cleared completely in approximately 24 hours with an approximately mean half-life (t\n1/2) of \nhepatic elimination of 10 h. This m ean half-life is significantly shorter \nthan that of dextran coated nanoparticl es as Endorem, revealing a lower \nvascular and tisular adheren ce and allowing for repetitive administration \nprotocols at shorter time intervals. \nNotably, the administration of  Nanotex at a dose twice the one \nrecommended (30 micromol Fe/kg body weight) demonstrated a \nsignificantly improved relaxation effect in the liver, only slightly smaller \nthan that obtained with Endorem (15 micromol/Kg body weight), without appreciable changes in the rapid Na notex elimination rate from liver.  40 \n  \nFigure 2.6. In vivo pharmacokinetics of hepatic clearance of Nanotex \nand Endorem after i.v. nano particle administrations.  Relative changes in \nhepatic T 2* after injection of a single dose (15 micromol Fe /kg body weight) and \ndouble dose (30 micromol Fe/kg body weight) of Nanotex in the tail vein of mice \nare compared with those induced by Endorem (15 micromol Fe/Kg body weight). \nThe results represent, mean and standard deviation of four animals investigated \nafter administration of the contrast agent. The region between 0 and 6 hours is \namplified in the insert for improved visu alization of the enhancement effect. \n41 \n Notably, the administration of the do uble dose showed no adverse \nsymptoms and all mice survived the study. \nIn summary, we have shown that Nanotex depicts appropriate relaxation \nproperties, lack of toxic effects and optimal pharmacokinetic properties improving those of Endorem. Taking  together, these properties make \nNanotex a very competitive superparamagnetic nanoparticle in \ncomparison with the ones currently avai lable commercially.  However it \nremains important to demonstrate a specific application in MRI, where \nits advantages are more evidently proven  in comparison with those of \nthe earlier generation of paramagn etic and superparamagnetic \nnanoparticles. This is addressed in the next section.  \n2.3.3. Use of Nanotex in Perfusion Imaging \nTo this end we selected the MR im aging of tumoral perfusion, an \nadvanced protocol used in  the clinic with either gadolinium or iron based \ncontrast agents. We set up the glioblastoma multiform model obtained \nafter implantation of C6 cells, and investigated comparatively if Nanotex, \nEndorem and Gd(III)DTPA could prov ide improved information of the \nperformance of the neoangiog enic vasculature of glioblastoma. \nFigure 2.7 illustrates the de termination of cerebral  perfusion parameters \nusing Magnevist, Resovist or Nanotex in rats carrying implanted C6 glial \ntumours. Briefly, the figure illustrates the fitting of the perfusion gamma \nfunction (red) to the kinetics of \u201cb olus\u201d passage of the different contrast \nagents (blue). 42 \n  \nFigure 2.7. Comparative study of tumoral perfusion by the \u201cbolus \ntracking\u201d method in the C6 glio ma model using paramagnetic or \nsuperpamagnetic agents. A: Gd(III) DTPA (Magnevist, Bayer, DE), B: Resovist \n(Bayer, DE) and C: Nanotex (Nanotex, ES).  \nNote that superparamagnetic Nanotex showed a similar behaviour to \nthat of paramagnetic Magnevist, a behaviour not observed with the \ncommercial superparamagnetic nanoparticle Resovist. Nanotex \ndemonstrates a fast transit time and a virtually complete perfusion \nrecovery after i.v. injection, revealin g that Nanotex behaves similarly to \nMagnevist, does not remain fi xed in the neovasculature as Resovist and \ndoes not adhere, nor sign ificantly interacts with the endothelium of the \nglioma neovasculature. \nTable 2.3 shows CBF [(ml/100g)/min], CBV (ml/100g) and MTT (s) values \nof Nanotex (15 micromol Fe/kg body weight) in the brain of rats carrying \nimplanted C6 tumours, as calculated from the non-linear fittings to the  \ngamma function representing the tran sit of the contrast agent. The \nresults are compared with another na noparticle, Resovist, and with \nMagnevist, a contrast agent based in Gadolinium chelates used as \ncontrast agent in MRI.  \n43 \n Table 2.3. Cerebral perfusion pa rameters determined by the MRI bolus \ntracking method using Magnevis t, Resovist or Nanotex (15 micromol \nFe/Kg body weight). \n \n Value (mean\u00b1sd)a) \nPerfusion parameter Nanotex Magnevist Resovist \nCBF (mL/100g/min) 22.86\u00b14.62 196.97\u00b1108.01 69.79\u00b140.01 \nCBV (mL/100g) 1.41\u00b1 0.06 17.97\u00b117.75 9.72\u00b16.92 \nMTT (s) 3.55\u00b1 1.00 5.69\u00b12.21 8.45\u00b14.61 \na) Perfusion values were determined in vivo  at 7T (Bruker Pharmasc an)from CD1 mice after \nthe injection of Nanotex, Magnevist or Resovist bolus.  \n \nNanotex depicted a shorter mean transi t time in tissue than Magnevist \nand Resovist, probably due to the charged polyacrylic acid cover which \navoid the aggregation of nanoparticles between them and with the capillary. Also, the cerebral blood volume is smaller for Nanotex \nindicating that this nanoparticle does not extravasculate from the blood \nto the surrounding tissue. On these grounds, Nanotex displays very \nfavourable first passage kinetics and recovery through the cerebral \nmicrovasculature. \n2.3.4. Use of Nanotex as Contrast Agent in CT images. \nDue to the ferric nucleus we thoug ht that Nanotex could be a good \ncandidate as contrast agent in CT im ages. Figure 2.8 shows the results of \nthe analysis of Nanotex as a X Ray contrast agent. To evaluate this fact, \nNanotex was compared with a commer cial X Ray contrast agent (Figure \n2.8. A) finding that the signal produ ced by Nanotex was smaller than  \nUltravist. The posterior analysis with ImageJ indi cates that Nanotex \nshows a signal enhancing effect but sm aller than the commercial contrast \nagent Ultravist (Figure 2.8. B). 44 \n  \nFigure 2.8. Comparison of Nanotex and Ultravist (Bayer Schering, DE) as \nCT contrast agents.  X Ray images of different concentrations of Nanotex (A, \nleft column) shows a contrast effect but lower than a commercial contrast \nagent, Ultravist (A, right colu mn). B shows the values of  intensity at different \nconcentrations and the adjus tment of data to a line showing the more intense \neffect of Ultravist as X-rays contrast agent. \n2.4. Discussion \nWe developed a novel superparamagnetic nanoparticle for magnetic \nresonance imaging with an inorganic core diameter smaller than 15 nm \nand a negative surface electrical cha rge at neutral pH, two important \nfeatures that contribute importantly to its intrinsic low vascular and \ntissular adherence in vivo . The combination of these properties \ndetermines an excellent pharmacok inetic profile with very reduced \ntoxicity and optimal vascular transit times. The new nanoparticle shows \nonly transient retention in the liver, wi thout significant bioaccumulation, \nthus allowing repeated administration protocols, compatible also with \nthe imaging of hepatic lesions. Reduced accumulation and efficient \nelimination may permit the frequent repetition of Magnetic Resonance \n45 \n Imaging studies along time, at much short intervals than those required \nwith currently available commercial [76, 77]. \nThe lower tissue adherence of Nanote x, in comparison with Endorem or \nResovist, merits further analysis. Since the ir on core is very similar, the \ndifference must necessarily rely in the polyacrylic acid coating. We believe this coating endows Nanotex with a negatively charged surface at \nneutral pH, favouring repulsion with other Nanotex particles and with the \nnegatively charged phospholipid headg roups and proteins from the \nsurface of endothelial cells. These repuls ive interactions are not present \nin the commercial nanoparticles coated with dextran or cross-linked \ndextran, which easily adso rb over endothelial surfac es or interact with \nneighbouring particles most probab ly through hydrogen bonding. This \nnon-specific interaction may favour the formation of aggregates of \nResovist and Endorem with blood cells or within themselves, difficulting \ntheir passage through narr ow capillaries, a circumstance that would not \nhappen with the negatively charged Nanotex. \nThe comparison of the magnetic pr operties of Nanotex with commercial \nnanoparticles as Endorem or Resovist shows, however, less favourable r\n1 \nand r 2 magnetic relaxivity properties for Nanotex [49]. Nevertheless, \nNanotex T 2 relaxation remains adequate for excellent in vivo imaging of \nthe liver and hepatic pathologies. Moreover, Nanotex r 2* relaxivity is \nimproved with respect to the commercial nanoparticles, favouring an advantageous use of ou r nanoparticle with T\n2* imaging based methods, \nsuch as perfusion MRI. In this sense, the excellent r2* values of Nanotex, \nadd to its low adherence properties to configure very clean first passage \nkinetics, returning completely to baseline, a circumstance not observed 46 \n with commercial nanoparticles and on ly attainable previously with \nGd(III)DTPA complex. This collection of properties makes Nanotex an \nideal candidate to be used in tissue and tumoral perfusion assays in vivo  \nwith Magnetic Resonance Imaging,  supporting a potential commercial \ndevelopment. A patent has been file d protecting the nanoparticle and its \napplications [78]. \n  47 \n  \n \n \n \nChapter 3 \nMagnetoliposomes loaded with \u03c9-3 \nPolyunsaturated Fatty acids as anti-\ninflammatory theragnostic agents \n \nChapter 3 describes the development of a new \ntheragnostic formulation based in liposomes \ncontaining both, a \n -3 polyunsaturated fatty \nacid and an imaging biomarker. The efficacy of this new formulation is validated using a variety of imaging techniques an d with different animal \nmodels of colonic in flammation and cancer. .  49 \n 3.1. Introduction \nInflammatory lesions are associated to the most prevalent and morbid \npathologies includin g atherosclerosis [79], neurodegeneration [80] \ndiabetes or obesity [81] and cancer [82], among others. Decreases in the \ninflammatory phenotype are known to improve the disease progression and the patient\u00b4s quality of life, as well as to favour a better recovery \n[83]. With this aim, a variety of anti-inflammatory drugs have been \nproposed as adjuvant therapies for the different diseases, including \nmainly steroidal or non-steroida l treatments [84]. In all cases, anti-\ninflammatory therapies demand the use of relatively large doses of the \nactive drugs and inevitably end up developing, sometimes too early, a \ncollection of adverse second ary effects that preclude further treatment \n[85]. On these grounds, methods to improve the efficiency of anti-\ninflammatory drug delivery to the  lesion, therefore increasing its \nselectivity and efficacy, entail considerable  interest as well as potentially \nvast applications in a wide spectrum of diseases. \nLiposomes have been proposed previously as novel nanotechnology \nformulations to improve drug delivery  to a variety of inflammatory \ndiseases [86, 87]. Targeting of the infl ammatory region may be achieved \nusing either active or passive appro aches. Active targeting involves the \nuse vectorial reagents embedded in  the liposomal membrane that \nrecognize epitopes of the target tissue [88]. Passive targeting refers to \nthe passive accumulation of the liposomes in the inflamed regions \nbecause of their increased capillary permeability and limited clearance \n[89]. In both cases it becomes difficul t to visualize if the liposomal \npreparation has arrived to the target ti ssue and many times, only indirect 50 \n measurements of inflammation pr ovide an index of the anti-\ninflammatory effect. It would becom e then very useful, to visualize \ndirectly and non-invasively the presenc e of the drug loaded liposomes in \nthe lesion. Liposomes are optimal structures for this purpose, since they \ncan be prepared to contain in their lumen, in addition  to the anti-\ninflammatory drug, a variety of imaging indicators either radioactive, \nfluorescent or superparamagnetic. This approach is known as image \nguided drug delivery [90], representing currently the most promising \nstrategy to diagnose and tr eat inflammatory diseases. \nRecently, important anti-inflammatory effects have been reported using \npreparations of omega-3 fatty acids [9 1-94], a kind of long chain \npolyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) mainly  present in fish oil and used as \ndietary supplements. Omega-3 PUFAs allow prolonged anti-inflammatory \ntreatments without the appearance of  the deleterious secondary effects \nof alternative steroidal or non-steroidal drugs [95]. \nIn this chapter we report a suc cessful protocol to encapsulate \n -3 \npolyunsaturated fatty acid ethyl est er (PUFA-EE) in liposomal \npreparations containing, in addition, ei ther the Nanotex \nsuperparamagnetic nanoparticle or  the rhodamine-100 dye. These \nadvanced theragnostic p reparations maintain in its integrity the \ntherapeutic potential of free \u03c9-3 PUFA -EE, potentiated with important \nmultimodal imaging capabiliti es. We demonstrate their anti-\ninflammatory effects in vivo , in animal models of colonic and oncologic \ninflammation. 51 \n 3.2. Materials and Methods \n3.2.1. Preparation and Charact erization of Liposomes \nLipid hydration and extrusion method \nLiposomes were prepared essentially using the film hydration method \n[96]. Briefly, 20 mg of L-\u03b1-phosphati dylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., \nAlabaster, Alabama, USA) we re dissolved in 2 mL of chloroform (Merck, \nDarmstad, DE). The solution was placed in  a round flask and subjected to \nrotary evaporation (Heindolph In struments, Schwabach, DE) for sixty \nminutes, 280 rpm, 474 mBar and 40 0C. The lipid film formed after \nchloroform evaporation was further rotated under the same conditions \nto remove chloroform traces. Then, the dried lipid lecithin film was rehydrated with 5 mL of water (containing or not the active principle or \nimaging probe) and rotated 60 minu tes at atmospheric pressure and 50 \n0C. This process generates a heterog eneous suspension of liposomes of \ndifferent sizes containing or not the acti ve principles and imaging probes \nin their lumen as delivered with the hydration buffer. To homogenize the \nsize distribution, the liposomal suspension was extruded eleven times (Northen Lipids, Burnaby, CAN) under nitrogen pres sure through a 200 \nnm membrane (Whatman, GE Healthcare, Fairfield, Connecticut, USA) \nmaintaining the temperature at 50 \n0C. The resulting suspension \ncontaining homogenous liposome s, loaded or not with the selected \nimaging agent and \u03c9-3 PU FA-EE, was stored at 4 0C until further \nutilization. A schematic description of the  process can be seen in Figure \n3.1.  52 \n  \nFigure 3.1. Preparation of liposomes.  Liposomes are prepared from egg yolk \nlecithin, containing or not \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE,  Nanotex or rhodamine-100 by the film \nhydration method [96]. A solution of chl oroform and lecithin is rotated under \nvacuum to remove chloroform and depo sit a thin lecithin film covering the \nround bottom flask. Hydration of this f ilm with aqueous buffer  results liposomes \nof different sizes and different num ber of layers. Na notex, \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE or \nrhodamine-100 may be added to the buffer, resulting in their intraluminal \nencapsulation after liposomal formatio n. Some residual Nanotex, \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE \nor rhodamine-100 may remain in the extr aliposomal space. Repeated extrusions \n(x11), result in crude homo geneous suspensions of lipos omes loaded or not with \nadded components in their lumen, but also present in the extr aliposomal space. \nThese may be removed later after a purificati on process, normally based in size \nexclusion chromatography or differential  centrifugation through filters of \ncontrolled pore size.  \nWe prepared liposomes encapsulati ng either suspensions of (i) buffer \nalone, (ii) Nanotex (25 mg Fe/mL, Solutex S.L., Alco bendas, ES) as MRI \ndetectable probe, (iii) Nanotex an d \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE (0.1% aqueous volume, \nSolutex S.L., Alcobend as, ES) as theragnostic anti -inflammatory agents \ndetectable by MRI, or  (iv) Nanotex with rhodamine-100 chloride (10 \n53 \n mg/mL, Sigma Aldrich, Barcelona, ES) as a novel agent detectable by \nhybrid fluorescence and MRI. \nTransmission Electron Microscopy \nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM ) images were acquired in a JEOL \nJEM1010 100 kV (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, JAP) from samples of empty liposomes, Nanotex and liposomes loaded with Nanotex, stained with \nuranil acetate [97]. \nDynamic Light Scattering \nThe size of liposomes was measured by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS, \nDynaPro MS/X (Wyatt Inc., Dernbach, DE) essentially as described in refs. [98, 99]. A dilution 1:10 of the origin al samples in water was placed in a \nquartz cuvette inside the  apparatus to perform the light scattering \nmeasurement. Several dilution steps  of the original sample were \nnecessary to allow for appropriate inte nsity of light scattering profile in \nthe sample. The presence of Nanotex in the preparations hampered light \nscattering measurements in the corresponding preparations, most \nprobably due to the high optic densi ty and reflectance of the solution. \n1H High Resolution Magi c Angle Spinning (HRMAS) \n1H HRMAS spectroscopy was performed using a Bruker Avance 11.7 T \ninstrument equipped with a High Reso lution Magic Angle Spining \n(HRMAS) accessory, interfaced with a Linu x driven Paravision IV console \n(Bruker BIOSPIN, Ettlingen, DE). Briefly,  samples were dissolved in 25 \u03bcL \ndeuterated water (99.2% 2H, Apollo Scientific Limited, Stockport, UK) or \ndeuterated chloroform (99.8%, Scharl au, Barcelona, ESP) containing \n1mM TSP (trimetil sylil 2, 2\u2019, 3, 3\u2019  tetradeutero sodium propionate) or 1 54 \n mM TMS (tetramethyl silane, Scharl au, Barcelona, ES) used as chemical \nshift references, placed in 50 \u03bcL zirc onium rotors and inserted in the \nrotating probe adapted to the magnet. Water suppressed 1H HRMAS \nspectra (40C, 4000 Hz) were acquired usin g the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gil \nsequence with \u03c0/2 pulses, spectral width of 10 kHz, acquisition time of 0.41 sec, D1= 1 sec, 72 \u03c0 pulses with a separation time \u03c4 = 1 ms and \nprocessed using 1 Hz exponential li ne broadening applied in the time \ndomain prior to Fourier Transformation [68].  \nHRMAS DOSY (Diffusion-Ordered NMR Spectroscopy) spectra of \nliposomes were acquired in a Bruker AVANCE III of 400 MHz (Bruker \nBIOSPIN, Ettlingen, DE) using a \n1H selective probe and NMR tubes of \n5mm. The spin-echo Stejsktahl-Tanner sequence, was used with diffusion \nintervals of 20, 50 and 100 ms and diffusion gradient strengths from 2% \nto 95% of the maximal power of th e Z gradient (sixteen increments) [68]. \nWater Relaxivity Measurements \nWe investigated the effect of magnetoliposomes on the T 1 and T 2 \nmagnetic relaxation properties of the water molecules of the suspension, \nto assess their potential usefulness as im aging agents for MRI detection. \nT1 and T 2 relaxation times of magnetolipos omes were investigated in two \ndifferent liposomal samples, containi ng or not the superparamagnetic \nparticle Nanotex (0.5 mg/mL). Dilutions of the original suspensions to 50% and 25% of the initial conc entration were used to generate the \nrelaxation vs. concentration profiles. Briefly, T\n1 and T 2 values of all \nsamples (37 0C) were measured using the inversion recovery sequence or \nCarr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequences using a Bruker Minispec \n1.5 Tesla (Bruker BIOSPIN, Ettlingen, DE) [67].  55 \n Fluorescence Properties \nWe investigated the fluorescent prop erties of magnetoliposomes labeled \nwith rhodamine-100 chloride both in vitro  and in vivo  using an in vivo  \nIVIS-Lumina system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) [100]. In vitro  and in vivo  fluorescence images were acquired using a Green \nFluorescent Protein filter (GFP, excitation bandpass 445-490 nm, \nemission bandpass 515-575 nm) and sixty seconds exposition. For the in \nvitro  studies, three samples of liposomes containing or not the \nnanoparticle (25 mg Fe/mL) and the fluorescent dye (10 mg/mL), at different concentrations (18.75 mg Fe/mL, 12.5 mg Fe/mL, 6.25 mg Fe/mL for the nanoparticle and 7.5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL for rhodamine-100) were pl aced in 96-well plate and scanned. For the in vivo  \nstudies, CD1 adult mice (30g body weight) were anesthetized in a \nventilated chamber with a mixture of ox ygen and isofluo rane (2%, Isoflo, \nEsteve, Barcelona, ES) and maintained on it during the scanning period. \nImages were acquired as indicated above, before and after the i.p. \ninjection (200 \nL) of the lipo somal preparations. \nUltrafiltration by Centrifugation \nThe ultrafiltration method separate s the sample in two fractions, \nsediment and ultrafiltrate, by forcing the sample to pass through a filter \nof controlled pore size, using centrifu gal force. For this purpose, we use \nmolecular size filters with a pass of 300 KDa (Vivaspin 6, MWCO 300 KDa, \nVivaproducts, Littleton, MA, US). The centrifuge used was J-6B (Beckman \nCoulter, L\u2019Hospitalet de Llobregat, ES) with centrifugation conditions of \n2891 g (3900 rpm, 20 0C, 1 hour). After the centrifu gation, the absorption \nspectra (200 \u2013 600 nm) of the sediment and the ultrafiltrate was 56 \n analysed using multiwall plates in a vertical spectrofluorimeter (Synergy, \nBiotek, Winooski, VT, US).   \n3.2.2. In vivo evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity \nAnimal Models of Inflammation and Experimental Design \nAll animal protocols were approved by  appropriate institutional review \npanels and follow the guidelines of National advisory bodies in animal \nwelfare.  \nA convenient model of colonic inflam mation was induced in C56BL6 mice \nthrough the administration of Dextran Sulfate sodium salt (DSS, Leti, Barcelona, ESP) dissolved (3.5%) in the drinking water during 5 days [101]. Briefly, three groups of mice (n=6) received DSS treatment for five days and were injected in the tail vein (100 \u03bcL) with Phosphate Buffered \nSaline (Group 1), Magnetoliposomes (Group 2) and Magnetoliposomes \ncontaining \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE (Group 3)  during the first three days. The body \nweight evolution was followed in each mouse until the fifth day when the animals were investigated by MRI. For this purpose, mice were injected \ni.p. with 100 \u03bcL of Gd(III)DTPA (0.1M) just before coronal T\n1 images were \nacquired from the rectal zone of each mouse. Colonic inflammation was measured by the width of the rectal wall. After the MRI experiment, the \nadministration of DSS was stopped and normal drinking water was \nadministered to all mice, following their weight until 10\nth of study. \nThe model of oncologic inflammati on was induced in CD1 mice through \nthe stereotaxic implantation of approximately 106 C6 glioma cells in the \ncaudate nucleus of the mouse brain [102]. Fifteen days after the implantation the tumor had proliferated reaching sizes ranging from 0.5 57 \n to 1.5 cm. Two different treatments were investigated in mice 15th days \nafter the implantations: a first group (n=6) received Magnetoliposomes with \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE and another group (n=6) Magnetoliposomes without fatty acids ester. We investigated additionally a control group (n=6) that received no treatment. Treatments were administered intravenously \n(unique doses of 100 \nL) and the growth of the glioblastoma was \nmonitored by MRI obtaining images weighted in T 1 and T 2. \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging \nAll MRI examinations were performed using a 7 Tesla horizontal magnet \n(16 cm bore) interfaced with a Bruker AVANCE III radiofrequency console \noperated through a Linux platform running Paravision V software. \nThe colon inflammation model was explored with T 1 images using a Multi \nSlice Multi Echo (MSME) sequence, TE=10.643 ms, TR=521 ms, 3 \naverages, axial orientation, 22 slices, slice thickness 1.5 mm, interslice \ndistance 1.5 mm, field of view 3.8 cm.  \nThe glioma model was investigated with T 1 and T 2 images. T 2 images were  \nacquired using a Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement (RARE) \nsequence, TE=14.77 ms, TR=2500 m s, 6 averages, axial direction, 14 \nslices, slice thickness 1 mm, interslice di stance 1 mm, field of view 2.3. T 1 \nimages were acquired using a Mult i Slice Multi Echo (MSME) sequence, \nTE=10.643 ms, TR=350 ms, 3 averages, axial direction, 14 slices, slice \nthickness 1 mm, interslice distance 1 mm, field of view 2.3 cm.  \nT1 images were always obtained after the i.p. administration of 100 \n L of \nGd(III)DTPA (0.1M, Magnevist, Bayer Schering, Berlin, DE) to enhance T 1 \ncontrast. 58 \n Positron Emission  Tomography \nThe evolution of colonic inflammation was also followed by PET/CT. The images were taken in a trimodalit y scanner Inveon (Siemens AG, DE). \n18FDG (11 MBq doses) was administered fo rty five minutes before the CT \nand PET images were acquired to visuali ze the distribution of the isotope. \nFor the PET acquisition, we acquired  159 interferograms of 128 x 128 \npixels (pixel spacing 0.77 mm, slice thickness 0.796 mm) in a FOV of \n83x130mm. The acquisition lasted fifteen minutes and the reconstruction \nalgorithm used was the OSEM2D me thod with four iterations and \ncorrection by decay and scattering. The CT images were taken with a voltage of 80 kV and a current of 500 \u03bcA. The exposure time was 250 ms, acquiring 180 projections with a FOV of 83x130 mm. The SUV (standardized uptake value) value was determined with the corrections \nfor isotope decay and animal weight. \nStatistical Analysis \nComparisons used the mean and standard  deviation of all data from each \ngroup and the t-student test to assess si gnificance (p<0.05). Statistical \nanalysis was done using SPSS software (IBM, New York, NY, US). \n  59 \n 3.3. Results \n3.3.1. Dynamic Light Scattering  and Transmissi on Electron \nMicroscopy \nThe process of liposomal preparati on originates a suspension of \nliposomes with homogenous size. This size was determined \nexperimentally by Dynamic Ligh t Scattering (DLS) and Transmission \nElectron Microscopy (TEM) techniques. \n \nFigure 3.2. Determinatio ns of liposomal size.  Top panels: DLS of a \nsuspension of empty liposomes (A) and a suspension of liposomes loaded with \n\u03c9-3 PUFA-EE (B). Arrows indicate the size of larger aggregates of free \n -3 PUFA-\nEE (black), eventually moving  to the surface of the prep aration because of their \nlower density. Some nanometric goticules of \n -3 PUFA-EE (blue)  are observed \ntransiently. Bottom panels shows TEM images of empty liposomes stained with \nuranyl acetate (C), free Nanotex superp aragmagnetic nanoparticle (D), and \nliposomes loaded with Na notex (E). Note the presen ce of extraliposomal \nNanotex nanoparticles prior to final purification.  \n60 \n Figure 3.2 (top) shows representat ive results of size measurements in \nliposomal preparations containing (2B) or not (2A) \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE as \nperformed with DLS. DLS analysis of  liposomes without \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE \nshowed 200 nm diameter vesicles, corresponding well with the 200 nm filter used in the extrusion. The liposomal preparations containing \u03c9-3 \nPUFA-EE showed, in additi on to the expected 200 nm liposomal particles, \nlarger particles of approximately 7000 nm. These particles accumulated, \nat least partially, with time at the top of the preparation as a lipid layer, \nand were assigned to non-encapsulate d \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE aggregates that \npiled in the top of suspension and could be easily removed from the preparation before further use. Smaller size goticules of approximately \n20-30 nm could also be detected by DLS, but disappeared with time, merging with others and migrating  to the surface. The size of the \nliposomes loaded with Nanotex co uld not be measured with the DLS \ntechnique, since the nanoparticl e demonstrated a high degree of \nreflectance incompatible with the si ze measurement. We investigated \nthen the size of these preparations us ing TEM (Figure 3.2, bottom \npanels). Fig 2C-E show TEM images of  empty liposomes, the nanoparticle \nNanotex only and liposomes con taining Nanotex, respectively. Empty \nliposomes (150-200 nm) required u ranil acetate shadowing to become \nobservable by TEM (2C), while Nano tex (7-8 nm diameter) was directly \nobservable. Liposomes loaded with Na notex (150-200 nm) showed also \nappreciable amounts of the superpara magnetic nanoparticle in the \nextraliposomal space. \n  61 \n 3.3.2. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy \nA brief study of the characteristics of  the \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE used became \nnecessary to elucidate the nature of i ts incorporation into the liposomes. \nTo this end we investigated the properties of \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE using \nMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. \n \nFigure 3.3. 1H HRMAS spectrum (500.13 MHz, 22 0C, 4000 Hz) of \u03c9-3 \nPUFA-EE in deutera ted chloroform. Assignments in Table 3.1.  \nFigure 3.3 shows representative 1H HRMAS spectra from a chloroform \nsuspension of \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE, acquired  as indicated in Methods. The \nspectrum shows clearly resolved resonances from the magnetically different protons of the \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE as specified in Table 3.1. It became \npossible to assign all observed resonances [103, 104]. \nOnce the \n1H HRMAS spectrum of \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE was well characterized, it \nbecame possible to compare it with the spectrum of empty liposomes and liposomes containing \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE. \n  \n62 \n Table 3.1.Assigments of \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE resonances indicating the proton \ngroup and the corresponding chemical shift. \n \nResonance Original protons ppma) \n1 -CH 2-CH3 0.96 \n2 CH3-CH 2-OOC-R 1.25 \n3 CH 3-CH 2-CH=C H-CH 2- 1.69 \n4 =CH-C H2-CH 2-CH 3 2.08 \n5 =CH-CH 2-CH 3 2.30 \n6 -OOC-C H2-  2.83 \n7 -(CH2)p-(CH=CH) m-(CH2)n- 4.11 \n8 -(CH 2)p-(CH=CH)m-(CH 2)n- 5.37 \n9 Deuterated chloroform 7.28 \na) Chemical shifts refereed to the deut erated chloroform diluted in the sample. \nFigure 3.4 shows representative HRMAS spectra from liposomal \nsuspensions containing (bottom) or not (top) \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE. Note that the \nbilayer membrane structure of the lipo somes precludes the observation \nof most resonances from the fatty acid chains. This is due to insufficient \nmotional averaging in  the NMR timescale because of the restrictions \nimposed by the bilayer structure of the membrane [105]. Interestingly, \nonly resonances from the choline head group at 3.2 ppm and some \nmethylene resonances from the fat ty acyl chains (at 2.9 ppm) are \nsufficiently mobile to originate obs ervable resonances in the empty \nliposomal preparation. In terestingly, resonances typical for the PUFA-EE \n(cf. Figure 3.3) can be easily distinguish ed in the preparation of liposomes \ncontaining fatty acids ester (bottom panel), revealing the incorporation \nof the fatty acid into the liposome, in a sufficiently mobile form to \noriginate a high resolution NMR resonance. 63 \n  \nFigure 3.4. 1H HRMAS (550.13 MHz, 4 0C, 4000 Hz) spectra liposomal \npreparations.  Spectra of aqueous su spensions from empty liposomes (top) and \nfrom liposomes loaded with  \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE (bottom).  Note that the spectrum of \nthe liposomal suspensions loaded wi th \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE is dominated by the \nresonances from the more mobile lipid droplets from \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE.  \nIn particular, the methyl groups  (resonance 1 of Table 3.1), the \nmethylene group vicinal to the carbox ylic group (resonance 7 of Table \n3.1) and the methyl groups correspo nding to \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE can be clearly \nresolved in the corresponding liposoma l preparation. The observation of \nthese resonances cannot be due to the incorporation of the fatty acid in \nthe liposomal membrane,  which would result in an almost complete \nimmobilization of the molecule and disappearance of its high resolution \nNMR signals. Rather, these \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE reveal the presence of \nsufficiently small fatty acid goticules in  the liposomal preparation, able to \noriginate high resolution signals thro ugh motional narrowing. This is \nconfirmed by the DLS measurement (Fig. 3.2.b) which reveals the \npresence of sufficiently small PUFA- EE nanoparticles of approximately 30 \nnm diameter. However, either the 1H HRMAS or DLS results do not reveal \n64 \n if the \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE goticules are present  in the intralumin al space of the \nliposome, in the extralip osomal space of the suspension, or in both.  \nTo investigate this aspect we performed Diffusion Weighted \nSpectroscopy experiments (DOSY) [1 06]. This approach measures the \nApparent Diffusion Coefficient of water (ADC) in the liposomal preparation. According to the Einstein\u00b4s principle the ADC is inversely \nproportional to the number of mo lecular obstructions that the water \nmolecule would find along its rando m mean diffusional path [107]. The \nmeasurement of ADC is dominated by the contribution of the \nextraliposomal volume and if go ticules would be present there at a \nsignificant proportion, one would exp ect a decrease in the observed ADC. \nIn contrast, if goticules would be located inside the liposomes, no \nadditional obstructions would be found in the extraliposomal volume and \nvery similar ADC\u00b4s would be mea sured in the presenc e and absence of \u03c9-\n3 PUFA-EE. \nFigure 3.5 shows the results of DOSY measurements of water diffusion in \nliposomal suspensions containing or  not PUFA-EE. No significant \ndifferences can be observed in the water ADCs values between both \npreparations at the three diffusion ti mes, suggesting that the fatty acids \nester droplets do not increase signifi cantly the molecular obstructions to \nwater movements. Since the ADCs are primarily dominated by those of the extraliposomal volume, present results suggest that most PUFA-EE goticules are localized in the intralum inal space or associated somehow \nto the membrane of the liposomal preparations. 65 \n  \nFigure 3.5. 1H HRMAS DOSY (400,7 MHz, 22 0C) spectra of water \ndiffusion in lipos omal suspensions.  Spectra were acquired in suspensions of \nliposomes loaded (top panels) or not (bottom panels) with \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE, \nacquired with diffusion times of 100 ms (left), 50 ms (center) and 20 ms (right). \nNote that the presence of \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE does not decreas e significantly the water \nADC, suggesting primarily an intralu minal location of the goticules.  \nThis could be demonstrat ed by the ultrafiltration experiments in which \nthe goticules of \n -3 PUFA-EE suspensions passed easily and quite \ncompletely the 300 kD filters, whi le the suspensions of liposomes \ncontaining \n -3 PUFA-EE did not appreciably  passed through filters of the \nsame dimensions. This confirmed that \n -3 PUFA-EE goticules are \npredominantly intraliposomal  as indicated by the water ADC \nmeasurements. \n66 \n 3.3.3. Magnetic Relaxation  Properties of Liposomal \nPreparations \nWe investigated the T 1 and T 2 magnetic relaxation properties of \nwater molecules in suspensions of li posomes, containing or not \nNanotex. Tables 3.2 and 3.3. summarize these results. \nTable 3.2.

It can be observed that the T 1 \nrelaxation value is shortest for the higher Nanotex concentration and \nincreases approximately linearly when suspensions are diluted, giving a relaxivity value r\n1 of 6.26 mM-1\u00b7s-1. The same situation is observed with \nempty liposomes, albeit with a much slope for the increase in T 1 \nrelaxation due to the absence of the superparamagnetic nanoparticle.  \n  67 \n Table 3.3.

T 2 values \nfor the original sample with Nanote x shows approximately 1000 times \nfaster relaxation than the empty liposomes (Table 3.2). It can be \nobserved that the T 2 relaxation value is shortest for the highest Nanotex \nconcentration and increases approx imately linearly when suspensions \nare diluted, giving a relaxivity value r 2 of 64.6 mM-1.s-1. The same \nsituation is observed with empty liposomes, albeit with a much lower \nincrease of T 2 relaxation upon dilution. \n3.3.4. Fluorescence in vitro  and in vivo  \nThe capacity of liposomes as optical  biomarkers was tested using in vitro  \nand in vivo  fluorescence approach. Figure 3.6 summarizes the results \nobtained in vitro  and in vivo  with liposomes containi ng or not Nanotex, \nand labeled fluorescently with rhodamine-100. 68 \n  \nFigure 3.6.

B: Fluorescence image. Note the larger \nfluorescence of the liposomes contain ing rhodamine-100 on ly as compared to \nthose containing rhodamine-100 and Nanotex.  C: In vivo  images reveal the \npresence of the liposomal preparations  injected i.p., arrow left: liposomes \ncontaining rhodamine-100 and Nano tex, arrow right: empty liposomes.  \nFigure 3.6A\u2013B shows results obtained in the in vitro  fluorescence \nexperiment, comparing the fluorescenc e of empty liposomes (left track), \nliposomes containing rhodamine- 100 (central track) and liposome \ncontaining rhodamine-100 and Nanotex (right track). Liposomes \ncontaining only rh odamine-100 present more fluorescence than \nliposomes containing both rhodam ine-100 and nanoparticles. This may \nbe due to either or both of tw o circumstances. First, liposomes with \nNanotex have to share their lumen space with rhodamine-100 and one or \nmore nanoparticles, resulting in a smaller intraluminal volume for \nrhodamine-100 accumulation and thus decreased rhodamine-100 \nconcentration. Second, Nanotex coul d partially quench the fluorescence \nof rhodamine-100.  \n69 \n Figure 3.6C shows the results of a representative in vivo  experiment in a \nmouse receiving an i.p. injection of  liposomes labele d with rhodamine-\n100 containing (left side) or not (right side) Nanotex. As in the in vitro  \nexperiments, liposomes wi th Nanotex and rhodam ine-100 depict less \nquantum efficiency than liposomes with only rhodamine-100, but they \nstill become observable by in vivo  fluorescence (Figure 3.6C). In this \nrespect, the in vivo  detection of magnetolip osomes with rhodamine-100 \nin their lumen may open new way s in theragnostic methods using \nmultimodal imaging detection combin ing MRI and fluorescence imaging.  \n3.3.5. Anti-Inflammatory Effects in vivo  in a Mouse Model of \nColonic Inflammation \nWe investigated the anti-inflammato ry effects of liposomal preparations \ncontaining or not \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE using a well-established model of colonic \ninflammation induced by dextran  sulfate (sodium salt, DSS) \nadministration. \nFigure 3.7 shows representative resul ts of the administration of \nmagnetoliposomes with and without \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE in mice with rectal \ninflammation induced by DSS. Un treated mice (3.7A) or those treated \nwith magnetoliposomes without \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE (3.7B) showed clearly \nincreased colonic wall thickness, easily observable in T 1w images after \nGd(III)DTPA enhancement. Ho wever, mice treated with \nmagnetoliposomes containing \u03c9-3 PU FA-EE (3.7C) depicted a significant \nreduction in colonic wall thickness, revealing an important anti-\ninflammatory effect of the theragnostic preparation in the DSS model.  70 \n  \nFigure 3.7.

A: untreated, B: \ntreated with liposomes containing Na notex and C: treated with liposomes \nloaded with Nanotex and \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE. \nThese results are summarized in Table 3.4. The therapeutic effects of \u03c9-3 \nPUFA-EE became even detectable in the DSS model by measuring the \nweight of the animals along the DSS treatment and several days later.  \nTable 3.4.

Colonic \n18FDG \nuptake is observed in all animals. This uptake appears to be, however, \nhigher in animals without liposo mal treatment than in animals treated \nwith magnetoliposomes either with or without PUFA-EE. \n \nFigure 3.8. PET-CT/FDG images of mice subjected to five days of DSS \nadministration untreated  (A), treated with placebo (B) or liposomal \nsuspensions containing Nanotex (C) with or without \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE (D). \nIncreased 18F-FDG uptake may be associated to increased inflammation, \nbecause macrophages and neutrophils are known to consume large \namounts of glucose or FDG.  However, a statistical analysis failed to reveal \nsignificant differences between the diff erent groups. This could be due to \n72 \n the heterogeneous behavior of the co lonic inflammation which affects \ndifferent regions in the diff erent animals making it difficult to compare \nthe results of different subjects in the same region. Taken together, our \nresults indicate that measurements of  rectal wall thickness provide a \nmore robust indicator to follow colonic inflammation and the effects of different therapies against colon inflammation. \n3.3.6. Anti-inflammatory Effects in vivo  in a Glioma Mouse \nModel \nWe then examined the effects of magnetoliposomes containing or not \u03c9-\n3 PUFA-EE in the inflammation associa ted to glioma growth, using the C6 \nglioma models. \n \nFigure 3.9.

However, mice receiving \nmagnetoliposomes containing \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE decreased notably the rate \nof glioma growth, and even increased the regression rate of the \nimplanted glioma.  \nTable 3.5.

Mice with no treatment depicted 74 \n piloerection, decrease in motor activi ty and eventually hemiplegia and \nhemiparesis, becoming necessary to sacrifice them after two or three weeks to comply with bioethical criteria. However, mice treated with liposomes with fatty acids ester SOLUTEX did not present such \nsymptoms, revealing significantly better physiopathological state and \nregression of the disease. Table 3.5 summarizes the results in an \nexperiment including two different treatments, mice treated with \nmagnetoliposomes containing or no t \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE, as well as control \ngroup with no treatment. The study of the T\n1 images revealed an intense \nanti-inflammatory effect in the mi ce treated with \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE, inducing \na reduction in the volume of glio ma (and the edema) and eventually \nregression of the tumor. \n3.4. Discussion \nI have presented a novel liposoma l formulation combining the \ntherapeutic properties of \n -3 PUFA-EE with the non-invasive imaging \ncapabilities of Nanotex or Rhodamine, or the combination of both. The \npreparation depicts potent anti-inf lammatory effects against colonic \ninflammation and is endowed with spectacular and unexpected \nantitumoral effects against C6 glioma , providing a valuab le illustration of \na novel and successful theragnostic strategy \nInterestingly, the encapsulation of a superparamagnetic nanoparticle in a \nliposome results in different relaxivity  properties as compared to those \nof the free nanoparticle in suspension. The relaxivity value r 1 increases \nfrom 0.55 s-1 mM-1 for free Nanotex in suspension to 6.26 s-1 mM-1 for 75 \n Nanotex encapsulated in li posomes. In the case of r 2, the value of 88.97  \ns-1 mM-1 for free Nanotex in solution decreases to 64.61 mM-1 s-1 for \nencapsulated Nanotex. These changes refl ect certainly modifications in \nthe dynamics of the nanoparticle- water interaction induced by the \nencapsulation process. Indeed it would be expected that the encapsulation would decrease the intera ction of the nanoparticle with \nthe surrounding water, because of the insulating effects of the liposomal \nmembrane barrier. These reduction effects are expected to occur mainly \nin the \u201couter sphere\u201d relaxivity comp onent, representing approximately \n50% of the total relaxivity [12, 108]. The \u201cinner sphere\u201d relaxivity component, reflecting mainly the di rect interaction of the nanoparticle \nwith water would be expected to be very similar in the free and encapsulated states, since it is determ ined by the magnetic properties of \nthe nanoparticle and its size, tw o aspects that are not expected to \nchange appreciably during the encapsulati on process. The approximately \n30% decrease observed in r\n2 follows closely enough this interpretation. \nHowever, a similar decrease would also be expected to occur in r 1. This is \nnot observed, indicating that the \u201cout er sphere\u201d effect is not the only \ndeterminant of the changes in relaxivity occurring after liposomal \nencapsulation. The r 1 value shows, in contrast, an important increase, \nlarger than an order of magnitude . The most probable cause of this \nincrease is a restriction in the rotatio nal movement of the nanoparticle in \nthe encapsulated environment. This may be imposed by, either an association to the liposomal membran e, an increase in intraluminal \nmicroviscosity, or binding or intera ction with neighboring nanoparticles, \nresulting in a slower tumbling time (\nr in [108]), reflected predominantly \nin r 1. Indeed r 1 and r 2 have different determinants and behavior, as 76 \n explained from the different Solomon-Bloembergen-Morgan equations \n[108-111], and it is not surpr ising that they respond differently to \nencapsulation. Moreover, r 1 and r 2, reflect the different time scales of T 1 \n(s) and T 2(ms), making easier to understand that the events occurring in \nthe ms range of T 2, may be too fast to be detected in the second range \ntime-scale of T 1. In conclusion, th e encapsulation of Na notex in liposomes \nappears to decrease the contribution of  the \u201couter sphere\u201d contribution, \nreflecting diffusional limitations imposed by the liposomal membrane, \nand decrease the tumbling time of  the nanoparticle, revealing \nassociations to the liposomal me mbrane or to other nanoparticles. \nThe liposomal encapsulation \n -3 PUFA-EE merits also further comments \n[112, 113]. Our results show that it is  possible to encapsulate significant \namounts of the lipid soluble \n -3 PUFA-EE in the lumen of liposomes. This \ncan be observed by the prominent 1H HRMAS resonances of liposomal \nsuspensions containing the encapsulated fatty acids. The fact that these \nresonances are observed reveals that the \n -3 PUFA-EE are present as \nsmall, fast tumbling goticules inside  the liposomes. This is because the \nsimilar \n -3 PUFA-EE goticules present in water suspensions, pass easily \nthrough 300 kD filters, while encapsulated \n -3 PUFA goticules, do not \npass through the same filters, indicati ng that they are sequestered in the \nliposomal interior. This finding is  further confirmed by the fact that \nliposomal preparations containing encapsulated \n -3 PUFA EE show the \nsame ADC as the empty liposomal preparations, revealing that the \nobstructions contributed by the \u03c9-3 PUFA -EE goticules do not contribute \nappreciably to the ADC of the suspension, dominated mainly by the extraliposomal compartment. 77 \n We have shown also that the magnetoliposomal preparations containing \nNanotex and \n -3 PUFA-EE present important anti-inflammatory activity \nagainst colonic inflammation and spectacular antitumoral effects against \nglioma. \nColonic inflammation is a disease associated to ulcerative colitis and \nChron\u00b4s disease, two incurable patho logies at present. These are treated \ncurrently with conventional anti-inf lammatory therapies [84], mostly free \nsteroidal (budesonide) drugs, an d eventually colonic resection by \nsurgery. The formulation proposed here has been shown to become \ntherapeutically useful in animal models  of DSS intoxication, adding a \nnew, non-toxic formulation to the arsenal of therapeutic methods \nagainst these two morbid  and prevalent diseases. \nFinally, our liposoma l formulation encapsulating \n -3 PUFA-EE and \nNanotex has demonstrated spectacular effects against glioma, slowing \ndown proliferation and even induc ing remission.  These effects are due \nto the combination of Nanotex and the \n -3 PUFAA-EE since they are not \ninduced by empty liposomes or liposomes containing \n -3 PUFA-EE only. \nThe precise mechanism remains to be elucidated but could probably involve a decrease in the infla mmatory component and cytokines \nrequired for glioma proliferation and invasion. \nIn summary our results  illustrate the properties and use of a new \nnanotechnological formulation inc luding one or more imaging agents and \na therapeutic molecule, useful in the treatment of the inflammatory \ncomponent of colonic inflammation an d glioma. A patent has been filed \nprotecting the preparation, properties and use of this formulation [114].   79 \n  \n \n \n \n \nChapter 4 \nCarbon Nanotubes as novel anisotropic \ncontrast agents for MRI \n \nChapter 4 provides a systematic study of the \nmagnetic anisotropy properties of Carbon Nanotubes, their molecular determinants and \ntheir potential use in Magnetic Resonance \nImaging studies of molec ular orientation. \n   81 \n 4.1. Introduction \nCarbon Nanotubes have reached consid erable interest in Physics, \nChemistry and Biomedicine because of their outstanding \nphysicochemical properties includin g; electrical conductance, magnetic \ncharacter, optical activity, thermal cap acity, elasticity and chemical \nversatility [115-122]. These properties are thought to arise from their \nunique graphene structure as organized in a nanotubular arrangement, \nin which the asymmetric molecular  organization determines the \nanisotropic physico-chemical properties [123-125]. The magnetic \nproperties and their anisotropic behavi or, entail particular interest in this \nrespect, since amorphous graphite is known not to be magnetic, while \ncarbon nanotubes are known to depi ct non zero magnetic moments, \nprobably reflecting electron flow through \n -orbitals surrounding the \nhexagonal or pentagonal ring consti tuents [126, 127]. Indeed, a number \nof studies have addressed the magnetic  properties of carbon nanotubes, \neither theoretically [119, 125-129] or experimentally [130-133]. \nThe use of carbon nanotubes as anis otropic contrast agents in Magnetic \nResonance Imaging entails particular relevance, since virtually all \ncurrently available contrast agents depi ct an isotropic behavior. Indeed \nthe use of an anisotropic contrast agent would allow to obtain the three \ndimensional spatial orientation of mo lecular assemblies to which it binds, \nincluding potentially receptors, mi crovascular perfusion arrangements \nand specific cellular populations, in  a very similar manner to that \nafforded by the Diffusion Tensor Imaging with anisotropic water diffusion \n[134, 135]. However, the origin of their magnetism, their precise \nmagnetic properties and their depend ence on molecular orientation in 82 \n suspensions of carbon nanotubes, remain still poorly characterized. To \nprogress in this respect, we investigat ed here the magnetic and optical \nanisotropies of Single Walled Carb on Nanotubes (SWCNTs) and Multi \nWalled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs), a ssessing the possibilities to use \nthese preparations as advanced an isotropic contrast agents in \nmultimodal imaging and particularly in MRI. \n4.2. Materials and methods \n4.2.1. Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes \nPreparation \nThree different samples of Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) \nwere investigated. Starting from comm ercial SWCNTs (Sigma-Aldrich, 40-\n60%, prepared by chemical vapour deposition, CVD) with initial \ndiameters of 2-10nm and lengths of 1-5\u03bcm, contaminated with residual \nNi (17%) and Y (4%) catalysts, we prepared samples of SWCNTs oxidized \nfor increasing times of 24 and 48h [136]. The original sample (200 mg) \nwas suspended in HNO 3 (65%, 25 ml) and heated to 100 0C under reflux \nduring either 24 or 48 h [137]. The reaction mixture was cooled down and diluted with deionized wat er (100 ml). The resulting suspension was \ncentrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 mi n and the precipitate was resuspended \nin deionized water, placed inside a dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por\u00ae 3 \nDialysis Membrane, MWCO 3500 Da , SpectrumLabs, Rancho Dominguez \nCA, USA) and dialyzed against water until pH 5 .5. The dialyzed suspension \nwas centrifuged to isolate the SWCNTs which were then dried by rotary \nevaporation.   83 \n Characterization \nWater soluble SWCNTs were cha racterized using atomic force \nmicroscopy (AFM), high resolution t ransmission electron microscopy with \nenergy dispersive spectrometry (HRTEM-EDAX), thermogravimetric \nanalysis (TGA) and X-Ray fluorescence (XRF). \nAFM Microscopy \nThe Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images were obtained with a \ncommercial AFM (Nanotec Electroni ca, Cervantes FullMode AFM System, \nTres Cantos, Madrid, ES) and monocrystalline silicon cantilevers \n(Nanosensors PointProbe Plus, Neuchatel, SW) of force constant 2.8 N/m \nand resonance frequency 75 kHz,. The  nanotubes were dispersed in \nwater by ultrasonic agitation (ultrasound bath, 15 min) at a concentration of about 1 mg/ml. The supernatant (2\u03bcL) were deposited \nonto a cleaved muscovite mica substr ate and let air-dry for subsequent \nAFM observation.  \nHRTEM with EDAX \nHigh Resolution Transmission Ele ctron Microscopy (200 and 400 kV, \nJEOL, JEM-2000 FX and JEM-4000  EX, Alcobendas, Madrid, ES) in \ncombination with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDAX) was used to \ndetermine the metal composition of  the contaminant nanogranules. For \nthis study, a few drops of an aqueou s and methanol dispersion of the \nmaterial were placed on a copper grid and evaporated prior to \nobservation.  \n \n 84 \n Termogravimetric Analyses (TGA) \nWe used TGA to assess the effect of the oxidation time on the total \namount of metal catalyst presen t. Thermogravimetric analyses were \nperformed on a thermobalance TGA Q500 (TA Instruments, Barcelona, ES) using the following conditions. Nitrogen atmosphere: Temperature \nramp-rate: 50 \u00b0C/min, heating: 20-900 \u00b0C.  Air atmosphere: Flow rate of \n90 ml/min, Temperature ramp-rate of 50 \u00b0C/min, heating from 20 to \n1000 \u00b0C. \nX Ray Total Reflection Fluorescence (TXRF) \nTXRF spectra were acquired with a TXRF Extra-II (Rich&Seifert, DE) \nspectrometer. \nSuperconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) \nTo measure the hysteresis loops by SQUID we used the different SWNTs \nsamples (commercial, 24h and 48h) dissolved in Fetal Bovine Serum \n(2mg/ml) and ultrasonicated 15 minu tes. The sample was put inside de \nSQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS XL-5, San Diego, California, USA) in a liquid state. We applied a 5T field to orientate the \nnanotubes and then frozen the sample to maintain orientation. We \nmeasured the hysteresis loop at 5K in  two directions, in the parallel and \nperpendicular axes of the nanotub e with respect to the external \nmagnetic field.  \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) \nFor the Magnetic Resonance Imaging measurements, we mixed the SWCNTs suspension with melted agarose (0.5%, low melting 370C, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo , USA), and cooled down (22\n0C) to form a 85 \n solid gel inside a 7T magnet. This protocol was able to maintain oriented \nthe SWCNTs in the B 0 direction while gelling, keeping thereafter this \norientation in the solid agarose matrix. The SWCNTs oriented sample was placed in an Eppendor f tube accommodated to a home-made \ngoniometer, allowing the manual rotation of the sample inside the \nmagnet (Figure 4.1).  \n \nFigure 4.1. Home-made goniometer for directional MRI measurements. \nThis device makes it possible to rotate the sample in multiple directions inside \nthe magnet, including the parallel and perpendicular orientations to the \nmagnetic field.  \nWe measured T 2 values varying the orientation of the sample with \nrespect to B 0. We used a  spin echo sequences (TR=5000ms, TE=12ms) as \nimplemented in a Bruker Pharmascan 7 Tesla scanner (Bruker Daltonics, \nEttlingen, DE), employing a 38 mm volume coil. The Magnetic Resonance \nImaging measurements were analysed pixel  by pixel with the home made \nMyMap Analyzer software based in MatLab (MathWorks, Natick, \nMassachusetts, USA) to obtain the corresponding T 2 map. \n \n86 \n Cytotoxicity \nWe investigated cellular toxicity of  SWCNTs oxidized for 24h using two \ndifferent methods, either assessing mitoch ondrial function (MTT assay) \nor plasma membrane integ rity (LDH assay), respectively. C6 cells were \ngrown to confluence in Dulbecco' s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) \nusing 96 well plates. SWCNTs suspensi ons prepared on Fetal Bovine \nSerum (FBS) (Gibco, Life Technologies, Alcobendas, Madrid, ES), were \nadded to each well in final concentrati ons of 1, 10, 100 and 1000 \u03bcg mL-1, \nusing three cell replicas for every SWCN Ts concentration. The viability of \nthe cellular preparations was dete rmined spectrophotometrically \n(570nm, Spectramax, Molecular Devi ces, Downington, PA, USA) 1h and \n24h after the addition of the different SWCNTs suspensions, using commercial kits to determine mi tochondrial performance as the \nreduction of tetrazolium salts (MTT, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). As \nblank we used the medium from cells incubated in the absence of \nSWCNTs while cell death was induced by adding the toxic hydrazine (5 \nmM) to the incubation medium. \n4.2.2. Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes  \nPreparation \nWe used commercial Multi-Walled Carb on Nanotubes (MWNTs < 10 nm \nouter diameter, 1-2 \u03bcm length) synthesi zed by chemical vapor deposition \n(CVD) (SES Research Houston TX USA).  To prepare the nanotube treated \nsamples, the first step was the fragmentation of MWCNTs consisting in an oxidation under sulfonitric conditi ons during 24 hours in an ultrasonic \nbath at room temperature. This step is necessary to obtain shorter \ncarbon nanotubes that were subsequently derivatized by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking 87 \n forming adducts with aminopyrene, which  are significantly more soluble \nthan the commercial and oxidized MWCNTs. Pristine MWCNTs (330 mg) \nwere sonicated in a water bath for 24 h in 48 mL of sulfuric acid / nitric \nacid (3:1 v/v, 98% and 65% respectively) at room temperature [138-140]. The preparation followed then a sequenc e of rehydration with deionized \nwater and filtration (0.45 \u03bcm, Omnipo re membrane filtration, Millipore, \nUS) until pH became neutral. Finally the sample was dried, obtaining an \n84% of nanotubes oxidized (MWN TsCOOH). To stack the aminopyrene \nadduct, 25 mg of MWCNTsCOOH were suspended in 65 mL of DMF, \nultrasonicating the suspension  at 25 \n0C during 48 hours [141].  \nAfter that, when the suspension appear ed homogenous, 160 mg of \naminopyrene were added and then the mixture was stirred 3 hours. The \n\u03c0-\u03c0 stacking adducts formation was confirmed by TLC (Thin Layer \nCromatography). The residue was washed with Et 2O and filtered (0.45 \n\u03bcm, Omnipore membrane fi ltration, Millipore, US). \nCharacterization \nThe samples of MWCNTs (commercial, oxidized and oxidized containing \naminopirene) were characterized by Transmission Electron Microscopy \n(TEM). Transmission Electron Microscopy experiments were performed using JEOL JEM 2100 microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, JAP) operating at 200 \nkV. For TEM visualization, samples were prepared by dropping a solution \nof the compounds on a carbon copper grid (300 mesh). 88 \n  \nFigure 4.2.

Before and after the sample path, there are two polarizing \nlenses used to measure the anisotropy.  An electromagnet allows to apply \nmagnetic field transiently or continu ously. B: Photograp h of the device. \n89 \n Magnetooptical studies of nanotube alignment \nLight Dispersion \nTo investigate the alignment of the nanotubes in suspension (N,N \ndimethyilformamide, DMF, 3mg/mL) we used a QuantaMaster fluorimeter (PTI, Birmingham, NJ, USA) allowing for the measurements of \nlight dispersion and aniso tropy in the samples.  \nFor the magnetic alignment of th e preparations we used a home-made \narrangement placed inside the fluorimeter, consisting of an electromagnet with its poles applie d to the top and bottom of the \nfluorescence cuvette, leaving free the opti cal path. The field intensity of \nthis magnet is 50 Gauss (5\u00b710\n-3 T). The experimental set-up is shown in \nFigure 4.2. \nLight Absorption \nThe orientation of the nanotubes was fu rther investigated by following \nspectrophotometrically (LAMDA 1050 UV/Vis/NIR, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) the changes in ab sorbance with sample orientation \nin the nanotube suspensions. Two ty pes of MWCNTs samples were used, \neither MWCNTs in solution (Dimet hylformamide, DMF, 3 mg/mL) or \nMWCNTs magnetically oriented and fi xed in a solid block of agarose \n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, US A, 0.5%). In the solution study we \nused the same home-made magnet d escribed in the light dispersion \nstudies (Figure 4.2.B).  \nFor the study in the solid block of ag arose, MWCNTs were dissolved in at \nhigh temperature (60 \n0C) in liquid agarose and accommodated overnight \ninside a 7T Bruker Pharmascan magn et (16 cm bore) to orient the 90 \n nanotubes while liquid and keep them  fixed along B o direction while \ngelling. This experimental set-up is described in Figure 4.3.   \n \nFigure 4.3. Experimental set-up of  magnetic aligment detected through \nthe absorption of polarized light.  Light produced by an halogen lamp passes \nthrough a monochromator to illuminate the sample at 340 nm. A polarizing lens \nis located between the mono chromator and the sample to  allow rotation of the \npolarizing plane of light. \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging \nMRI techniques were used in the stud y of the alignment of the carbon \nnanotubes. T 2 maps were obtained from a so lid block of agarose with \nnanotubes fixed in a known direction. The sample was manually rotated \ninside a 7T Bruke r Pharmascan and T 2 maps (spin-echo sequence, \nTR=5000 ms, TE=12 ms) were acquired in two orthogonal directions, \nparallel and perpendicular (Figure 4.1). The T 2 maps were analysed using \n91 \n MyMap Analizer, an in a home written  software for image analysis based \nin MatLab libraries. \n4.3. Results \n4.3.1. Determinants of  Magnetic Anisotropy in SWCNTs \nSuspensions \nOxidation of the nanotubes modifies thei r length as detected by Atomic \nForce Microscopy (AFM). Figure 4.4 shows representative Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images of either commercial preparations of SWCNTs (Figure 4.4 A) or those obtained after nitric acid treatment for 24h (Figure 4.4 B) or 48h (Figure 4.4 C). These panels illustrate the classical nanotubular structures containing characteristic metal catalyst granules \nas detected with AFM [136]. The nitric acid oxidation treatment (24h-\n48h), reduced notably the SWCNTs length from 1-5 \u03bcm in the commercial \npreparation to 200-700 nm in the 48 h oxidized preparation, reducing also \nthe number of observable metallic granules. The oxidation process \nincreased concomitantly the width of the shortened tubes, roughly from \n1 nm in the commercial preparations to approximately 5-15 nm after 24h \nor 48h oxidation (Figure 4.4 D). R eduction in length is derived from \noxidative breakdown of the nanofilaments while the increase in diameter \nmay be caused by the longitudinal fo lding and stacking of two or more \nnanotube fragments, containing or no t some residual Ni covering.  \nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) sh owed a decrease in the total metal \ncontent from 33% in the commercial  preparations of SWCNTs to 20% and 92 \n 8% in the preparations oxidized for 24 or  48h, respectively (Figure 4.4 E) \n[137]. \n \nFigure 4.4. Characterization of Si ngle Walled Carbon Nanotubes.  \nRepresentative AFM images of SWCNTs pr eparations before (A) and after \noxidation during 24 (B) and 48 h (C). The met al granules of the samples are easily \nobserved. Height-Length plots obtained by AFM dur ing shortening of SWCNTs \nbefore and after oxidation during 24 and 48 hours (D). Nanotubes become \nshorter upon oxidation and their height  increases. TGA analysis shows a \ndecrease in the content of metal contamina nts with the oxidation time of the \nSWCNTs preparations (E). Metal content de creases with oxidation time. HRTEM \nwith EDAX microanalysis shows that the catalytic nanopa rticle is composed of Ni \n(insert) and Y (F). The peaks of Carbon, C, and Copper, Cu, correspond to \nSWCNTs and the grid, respectively.  \nTo investigate the me tal composition in the preparations we \nimplemented High Resolution Transm ission Electron Microscopy with \nEnergy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (HR TEM-EDAX), as indicated in the \nMaterials and Methods section. Figure 4.4 F shows the results obtained which revealed Ni and Y as the principal paramagnetic metal \n93 \n contaminants of the metallic nanog ranules (Figure 4.4 F, insert), the Cu \nsignals being derived mainly from the grid [137]. Roughly, Ni and Y \ncontent of the commercial preparations (17.6 % and 4.3 %), decreased after 24h oxidation (5.1 % and 0.9%) and even further after 48h oxidation \n(3.3 % and 0.6 %), as detected by  Total X Ray Fluorescence Reflection \nspectrometry (TXRF) respectively [136]. \nWe next explored, the magnetic pr operties of the SWCNTs preparations \noxidized for increasing tim es using SQUID (Figure 4.5). \n \nFigure 4.5. Magnetic properties of SWCNTs. \nMagnetic  hysteresis Loops (full \ndots, continuous lines) and virgin curves (empty dots, dotted lines) of SWCNT \npreparations oxidized with nitric acid for 0h (A), 24h (B) and 48h (C). Evolution of \nmagnetic anisotropy along chemical treat ment time (D). Note the increase in the \nmagnetic anisotropy value with increasing oxidation time.  \n94 \n To measure hysteresis loops and vi rgin curves by SQUID we used the \nSWCNTs samples (commercial, 24h and 48h) dissolved in Fetal Bovine \nSerum (2mg/ml) and ultrasonicated 15  minutes. Magnetic hysteresis \nloops were measured at 5 K and angles of \n  = 0 degrees and \n  = 90 \ndegrees, with respect to the direction of the applied magnetic field, for oriented nanotube suspensions. Briefly, the nanotube suspensions were introduced in the magnet in the liquid state for orientation, and frozen to \n5K where they remained oriented and fixed within the ice matrix. We \nmeasured then, virgin curves and hysteres is loops under these conditions \nand after 90 degrees rotation of the frozen sample. These measurements revealed clearly a paramagnetic behavior [142]. When the commercial SWCNTs preparation was oriented parallel to the external magnetic field \n(blue circles and lines), the magnet izations detected were larger than \nthose measured in the perpendicular direction (red circles and red lines) \n(Figure 4.5 A). The same behavior w as observed in SWCNTs preparations \noxidized for 24h (Figur e 4.5 B) and 48h (Figure 4.5 C), although the \nmagnitudes of total magnetization  and magnetic susceptibility were \ndifferent in each case. In addition, the virgin curves (empty circles) \nrevealed that magnetic susceptibility of SWCNTs is larger when measured in the parallel than in the perpendi cular orientations. Notably the \nmagnitude of the magnetic anisotropy (\n) \nincreased from 0.14 in the commerci al preparation, to 0.26 and 0.35 \nafter 24h and 48h oxidation, re spectively (Figure 4.5 D).  \nConsidering that the 24 and 48h nitric acid oxidations decrease the \nlength, increase the diameter and decre ase the metal content (Figure 4.4 \nD and E), these results suggest that the in crease in magnetic anisotropy 95 \n of the SWCNTs preparations (Figure 4. 5) is caused by the changes in \nthese properties. Increased magnetic an isotropy of SWCNTs preparations \noxidized for 24 or 48h, may thus reflect an easier alignment in the \nmagnetic field of the shorter nanotubes than of the commercial nanofilaments, including also the form ation of longitud inal aggregates \nwith larger diameter (c.f. Figure 4.4 D).  \nWe further investigated then the determin ants of magnetic anisotropy in \nSWCNTs preparations using Magnetic R esonance Imaging. We prepared \nfirst an oriented sample of co mmercial SWCNTs in solid agarose (0.5% \nw/v) by suspending the SWCNTs in melted agarose (60 \n0C) and allowing \nthe mixture to cool down to room temperature until the agarose became \na solid gel, entrapping the SWCNTs [136]. We investigated then the \nanisotropy contributed by soluble Ni ions and by superparamagnetic Ni \nnanoparticles in the SWCNT suspension.  To achieve this, we begun by \nentrapping a 10 mM NiCl solution (Si gma Aldrich, Alcobendas, Madrid, \nES) in solid agarose (0.5% w/v). We entrapped also in agarose \nsuspensions commercially available Nickel nanoparticles (577995, Sigma \nAldrich, MO, USA).  \nNote that a significant difference of average T 2 values is observed in the \nSWCNTs gel between the two orthog onal orientations, while no \ndifference is detected in the gels with NiCl 2 or Ni nanoparticles. \nWe obtained then MR images at ro om temperature, weighted in the \ntransversal relaxation time (T 2w), of the SWCNTs preparations (Figure 4.9 \nupper left panels), of the Ni gel (Figure 4.9, middle left panels) and of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles gel (Fig ure 4.9, lower left panels) in the 96 \n parallel and perpendicular directions to the external magnetic field using \na home-made goniometer (Figure 4.1).  \n \nFigure 4.6. T 2 imaging of SWCNTs suspensions oriented in agarose gels \nat room temperature (22 0C). Water T 2 maps (left panels) for Single Walled \nCarbon Nanotube prepar ations (top), a NiCl 2 solution (center) and \nsuperparamagnetic nanoparticles (bottom ), as embedded in solid agarose gels \n(0.5%) oriented parallel \n ||or perpendicular \n  to the static magnetic field B 0. \nAverage T 2 values for the three pr eparations (right panels).  \nT2 maps were then calculated pixel by pixel from the collection of images \nas indicated in Supplementary Informati on. The bargraphs (Figure 4.9, \nright panels) summarize the average T 2 values of the pixels from SWCNTs \n(upper right panel), oriented Ni gels (m iddle right panel) and oriented Ni \nnanoparticle gels (lower right panel), when the solid agarose gel was \noriented parallel (blue) or perpendicular (red) to the static magnetic field. \nAs control we obtained the same T 2 maps from agarose gels devoid of \nSWCNTs, Ni ions or Ni nanoparticles. \n97 \n Note that the SWCNTs preparations depict significantly larger T 2 water \nvalues when oriented in the paralle l (blue) than in the perpendicular \n(red) directions, as revealed by the shift to the green in Figure 4.9 (upper \nleft panels) and the values shown in the corresponding bar graphs (right \npanels). Notably, the pure agarose gel, and the Ni ion and Ni nanoparticle \ngels showed the same T 2 values in the parallel and in the perpendicular \ndirections. Taken together, these observations indicate that soluble Ni \nions, spherical superparamagnetic nanoparticle suspensions or the \nagarose gel itself, do not present an  intrinsic anisotropic behavior.  \n4.3.2. SWNCNTs Cytotoxicity \nFor its potential use as a contras t agent in MRI, it was necessary to \nmeasure the toxicity of SWCNTs (Figure 4.11). We observed approximately 100 % cell viability in  the absence of SWCNTs and roughly \nnull viability in cells exposed to the toxic. A decrease in formazan \nproduction was detected at the highest SWCNTs concentrations, a \nfinding that has been described previo usly to be due to a direct reaction \nof the nanotubes with the MTT molecule, rather to a cytotoxic effect on the cells [143]. To further invest igate cytotoxicity, we performed \nadditional tests using the same S WCNTs preparation but measuring the \nrelease of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from the cell suspensions as an \nindicator of plasma membrane integrit y and cell viability (Figure 4.11, B, \nD). 98 \n  \nFigure 4.7. Study of citotoxicity of SWCNTs. MTT assays (A,C) and fractional \nLDH release assays (B, D) of cellular viab ility for increasing concentrations of \nSWCNTs oxidized with nitric acid for 24h, ei ther 1h (A, B) or 24h (C, D) after the \naddition of the SWCNTs su spensions (1-1000 \u03bcg mL-1) in Fetal Bovine Serum to \nthe cells.  \nBriefly, SWCNTs were added to each well to final concentrations in the 1-\n1000 \u03bcg.mL-1 range. LDH activity was determined spectrophotometrically \n(340 nm, Spectramax, Molecular Devices, Downington, PA, USA) \nfollowing the linear decrease in NADH absorbance in mixtures containing \n50 mM HEPES pH: 7.0, 5 mM pyruvate  and 0.6 mM NADH. We initiated \nthe reaction with the addition of either aliquots from the incubation \nmedium or from the cell lysate obtain ed after four cycles of freezing and \nthawing. We used as blanks, aliquo ts of the incubation medium \ncontaining no SWCNTs and as a maximum LDH release, that induced by adding the detergent sodium  dodecylsulfate (2%) to the cell suspensions. \nWe determined then the fractional LDH released (LDH medium/(LDH \nmedium+LDH lysate) either after 1h or 24h incubations. While we \n99 \n observed no significant fractional LDH release in the blanks or close to 90 \n% after detergent treatment as expected, we detected no significant \nincrease in fractional LDH release with increasing concentrations of SWCNTs either after 1h or 24h incub ations. Taken together, our results \nrevealed no significant cytotoxic effects of our SWCNTs preparations in \nthe concentrations required for observable magnetic anisotropy effects. \n4.3.3. Characterization of Different Preparations of \nMWCNTs \nWe began by characterizing the MWCN Ts preparation using Transmission \nElectron microcopy (TEM). Figure 4.8 shows representative results of \ncommercial preparations and those obtained after the shortening \ntreatment. The commercial sample shows important heterogeneity with the presence of abundant impur ities and random bundles of \nnanofilaments (Figure 4.8 A and B). \nIt became then necessary to shorten them by oxidation and sonication to \nobtain a more homogenous sample pr ior to further studies. After the \noxidation treatment, the bundles began  to disentangle and the shorter \nnanotubes generated become freer, wi th some aggregates produced by \nelectrostatic forces still present (Figure 4.8 C and D). \nAdsorption of aminopyrene to the nanotubes resulted in a more \nhomogenous sample with fewer nanotubes forming bundles (Figure 4.8 E \nand F). We obtained a histogram of the treated sample to determine a \nmedian value for the length of oxid ized MWCNTs with aminopyrene in \nthis preparation (Figure 4.9). 100 \n  \nFigure 4.8. TEM images of  MWCNTs preparations.  Top panels: Commercial \nnanotubes form abundant bundles as shown at different magnifications (A: 6k, \nB: 30k). Central panels: Oxidized MWCNTs show some free nanotubes but also \nabundant nanotube bundles at different magnifications (C: 15k, D: 50k).  Bottom \npanels:  Treatment of oxidized MWCNTs with  aminopyrene reveals that almost \nevery bundle has been broken to free nano tubes at different magnifications (E: \n6k, F: 30k ). \nThe histogram showed an average length of 170 nm for the most \npopulated group. These results sho w that the nanotubes oxidized and \nwith amynopirene bound, constitute a homogenous dispersion which can \nbe suspended in water for further magneto-optical experiments. \n101 \n  \nFigure 4.9. Histogram of MWCNTs length after treatment. The most \npopulated size is around 170nm.  \n4.3.4. Magneto-Optical Evidences of MWCTs Alignment with \nExternal Magnetic Fields \nWe investigated magnetic alig nment and anisotropy using these \npreparations. To this end, it was necessary first, to confirm that our MWCNTs present sufficient magnetis m and are able to orient in a \nmagnetic field at room temperature. A light dispersion experiment was \ndesigned to investigate the magn etic behavior of MWCNTs. A stable \nsolution of nanotubes suspended in  dimethylformamide (DMF) was \nplaced inside a fluorimeter which perm ited us to collect the dispersed \nlight of the sample at a perpendicula r direction to the illumination \ndirection, using crossed polarizers (see  Figure 4.2 for the experimental \nset-up). We prepared an electrom agnet with poles on the top and \nbottom of the quartz cuvette, able to induce a transient or continuous \nmagnetic field through the nanotube suspension, while leaving unperturbed the optical path. We made  then successive light dispersion \nmeasurements in which the photons dispersed by the sample were collected successively in the detector with the magnetic field turned \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d (Figure 4.10). We observed that the presence of the magnetic \n102 \n field induced significant increases in  the dispersion while present, \nrevealing magnetic field ori entation of the MWCNTs sample. \n \nFigure 4.10. Photon counts of disperse d light collected successively in \nthe fluorimeter when switching the magnetic field \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d. The \nnumber of counts detected is higher when th e magnetic field is switched \u201con\u201d \nand decreases if the magnet field is swi tched \u201coff\u201d, in a reproducible manner. \nWe did one further experiment by switching \u201con\u201d continuously the \nmagnetic field. In this case, the co llected counts increased with time, \nsuggesting that the nanotube orientat ion of the sample is not \ninstantaneous and that the number of na notubes oriented parallel to the \nmagnetic field may increase progressi vely with the time of exposure \n(Figure 4.11). \nWhen the magnetic field was switched on the number of counts \nrecollected increased linearly with time , suggesting a reo rganization of \nthe nanotubes suspended in the sample paral lel to the magnetic field so \nthat the photons dispersed more light in the direction of the detector. (Figure 4.12). \n103 \n  \n \nFigure 4.11. Photon counts collected in the fluorimeter with time while \nswitching the magnetic field \u201co n\u201d or \u201coff\u201d continuously. With the \nmagnetic field turned \u201con\u201d from th e beginning, the number of counts detected \nincreases linearly with time.  \n \nFigure 4.12. Light disper sion in the fluorimeter.  With the field \u201con\u201d the \nnanotubes reorient parallel to the magnetic  field dispersing more photons to the \ndetector than when the field is off. \nAnisotropy measurements were also done with the fluorimeter using \npolarized light. For this experiment  two polarizers were accommodated \nat the exit of the Xe Lamp and in the center of the detector. The \n104 \n orientations of the polarizers were automatically set by the fluorimeter \ncontrols. The fluorimeter calculates the anisotropy of a sample by illuminating the sample with light po larized vertically and horizontally \nand analyzing the intensity of the ligh t in the detector. The anisotropy is \ncalculated using the equation: \n Eq. 4.1 \nwhere IVV is the intensity of the light when both polarizers were in \nvertical position, IVH with the lamp polarizer vertically and the detector \npolarizer horizontally and G is the G-factor is just a correction for the \npolarization given by \n Eq. 4.2 \nwhere IVH is the intensity of the light when the lamp polarizer is oriented \nhorizontally and the detector polarizer is vertically and IHH when both are \nhorizontally. \nThe anisotropy was measured along time in two different conditions, \nwith the magnetic field switched \u201con\u201d and switched \u201coff\u201d (Figure 4.13). When the magnetic field is switch \u201con\u201d the sample becomes more \nanisotropic, suggesting that the nanotubes orient parallel to the \nmagnetic field reaching an anisotropic structure. 105 \n  \nFigure 4.13. Light dispersion anisotropy values along time in the \npresence and absence of  external magnetic field.  Note that the nanotube \nsample becomes more anisotropic with the magnet field switch on.  \nA similar experiment was performed us ing spectrophotometric detection \nwith the nanotube suspension contai ning bound aminopyrene in DMF \n(Figure 4.3). First of all, we measured the absorption spectra of the \nsample, finding a maximum at 340 nm, corresponding to the aminopyrene ring [144]. The sampl e was then illuminated with polarized \nlight (340 nm). When the magnet field was switched \u201con\u201d and the nanotubes were perpendicular to the polarized light, the absorbance of \nthe sample increased until the magnet field was switched \u201coff\u201d (Figure \n4.14). \nThe next step was to fix the MWCNTs with a known direction in a matrix \nwhich permits us to measure the sa mple in two different directions in \nMRI. An agarose gel was chosen again fo r this purpose, keeping it inside a \n7 Tesla magnet to fix the nanotubes parallel to the magnetic field direction. To prove that the nanotubes were fixed in that direction we made measurements using the same spectrophotometric set up used to \n106 \n study the nanotubes suspension. In this experiment we accommodated \nthe matrix gel with nanotubes fixed in a known direction and the \npolarized light was rotated 3600 (Figure 4.15).  \n \n \nFigure 4.14. Absorbance (340 nm) vs time curve of MWCNTs suspension \nin DMF, in the presence (ON) and absence (OFF) of magnetic field \norientation.  The absorbance increas ed when the magnet field was switched \non. \nThe transmittance of light was maximum when the polarization of the \nlight was perpendicular to the na notubes (Figure 4.15 A). The \ntransmittance reaches a minimum when the light is parallel (around 900) \nand goes to maximum after a rotation of 1800. When the sample was \nrotated 900 we obtained a specular figure (Fig ure 4.15 B). This is due to \nthe \n -\n absorption of the aminopyrene molecule over the nanotube wall \nwhich results in different absorpti on properties depending on the \norientation of the molecule [144]. The aminopyrene is coupled to the nanotube with its 340 nm absorption  axis parallel to the nanotube[145]. \n107 \n These results reveal that when the nanotube is parallel to the light \npolarization plane the abso rption is maximum.  \n \n \nFigure 4.15. Transmittance of a fixed MWCNTs suspension in a solid \nagarose support for diff erent orientations of the light polarization \nplane.  A: MWCNTs fixed agarose gels are orie nted perpendicular to the initial \npolarization plane (0 degrees). The tr ansmittance reaches maximum values \n(minimal absorption) when the polarization plane is  perpendicular to the longest \nnanotube axis. B: MWCNTs fixed agarose ge ls are oriented parallel to the initial \npolarization plane (0 degrees). The tra nsmittance reaches minimal values \n(maximal absorption) when the polarization plane is parallel to the longest \nnanotube axis. The noise in A and B is different because of the different \norientation and inclination of the aga rose gel during the spectrophotometric \nmeasurement.  \n4.3.5. Magnetic Measureme nts of Relaxat ion Times for \nOriented MWCNTs \nMagnetic anisotropies have been also studied using the solid agarose \nmodel to fix the nanotubes. It was measured the transversal relaxivity (T\n2) of MWCNTs with MRI techniques. T 2 maps of a solid gel of agarose \nwith nanotubes oriented were measured  in two different directions, \nparallel and perpendicular to the ma gnetic field (Figure 4.16). \n108 \n In summary, our magneto-optical measurements confirm that MWCNTs \nsuspensions align with external magnetic fields at room temperature. \n \nFigure 4.16. T 2 values of MWCNTs fixed in agarose at different \ndirections.  Significant differences (p<0.05) of T 2 values of MWCNTs fixed \nin agarose in two different directions. \nWe obtained similar results than the experiments with SWCNTs, with \nsignificant differences between th e two measurements of the sample, \nparallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. \n4.4. Discussion \nUsing SWCNTs or MWCNTs preparation s, I have shown that magnetic \nand optical anisotropy are macro molecular properties which are \nconserved in these materials even at room temperature. In this sense, \nmagnetopoptical anisotropy of SWCN Ts and MWCNTs add to the large \ncollection of outstanding properties  of carbon nanotubes as electrical \nconductance, thermal capacity or elasticity [115-122]. This is particularly \nrelevant in the MRI contrast agent field since the most widely used \ngadolinium chelates and superparam agnetic nanoparticles depict \nisotropic magnetic relaxation prop erties. Indeed the free energy barriers \n109 \n for molecular reorientation are very low for subnanometric structures as \nthe gadolinium chelates, or even for spherical nanoparticles and thermally driven molecular reorientation  averages the magnetic moment \nin isotropic manner, at room te mperature [146]. The behaviour of \ntubular nanometric structures is di fferent and the energy barriers \nrequired for thermal reorientatio n at room temperature are sufficiently \nlarge to preclude nanotube reori entation at room temperature, thus \nproviding the thermodynamic basis for alignment phenomenon. We \nbelieve this is an outstan ding finding since it m ay allow the non-invasive \ndetermination of the three dimensional orientation of the nanotube from magnetic resonance measurements of the relaxation properties of the surrounding water in different dire ctions or the diffusional behaviour \nof water as obtained from Diffusion Tensor Imaging [135]. This would \npotentially allow to unravel non-invasively and in vivo the three \ndimensional orientation of mo lecular assemblies, microvascular \ntrajectories and cellular arrangements by labelling them selectively with \nSWCNTs or MWCNTs. \nIn this context, research on the mo lecular determinants of nanotube \nanisotropy acquires a fundamental relevance. Our results obtained by \nSQUID, become particularly enlighten ing to account for the magnetic \nanisotropy properties observed in water T\n2 by MRI. SQUID \nmeasurements reveal that the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy \nincreases with shortening of the nano tubular structures and is not due to \nthe contaminant Ni nanogranules. This indicates that the nanotubes \nthemselves, and their association with the Ni nanogranules, constitute \nthe main determinants of magnetic  anisotropy in these preparations. 110 \n Moreover, the larger magnetic susceptibilities in the parallel than in the \nperpendicular directions detected by SQUID provide the physical basis to \ninterpret the longer water T 2 in the parallel tha n in perpendicular \norientations detected by M RI. In MRI, longitudinal (T 1) and transversal \n(T2) relaxation times are known to increase with the effective magnetic \nfield  [22]. The resulting effective ma gnetic field on the sample \ndepends then on the static magnetic field provided by the magnet (a \nconstant value) and on the local magnetic field  originated by the \nSWCNTs or MWCNTs ( ). Thus the local magnetic \nfield depends directly on the magnetic susceptibility of the nanotubes \n( ). Since  in SWCNTs preparations,\nlocal local B B/g38 /g38\n|| and consequently, the water T 2 values \nobserved by MRI are higher in the parallel than in the perpendicular \norientation. \nThe advance in generating a water so luble nanotube preparation merits \nalso further comments. Previous preparations of pristine SWCNTs or \nMWCNts were highly water-insoluble  and useless in medicinal chemistry \napplications and contrast agent development [115-122]. We have shown here that MWCNTs can be adequately solubilized in water, after size \nreduction by sonication and aminopyrene \n-\n binding. The preparations \nobtained remain soluble and stable fo r several months, allowing for the \ndevelopment of therapeutic derivati ves, imaging probes or both. \nFurthermore, we also show that the nanotube preparations are non-\ntoxic, as revealed by the MTT and LDH release tests, in contrast with \nprevious reports that showed toxi city in nanotubes preparations 111 \n solubilized by detergents. Our results indicate that the nanotubular \nstructures are non-toxic by themselves, at the concentration range required for MRI or therapeutic interv entions and that previous toxicity \nresults may have derived from the detergent used, rather than from the \nnanotubes [147].  \nIn summary, we investigated the determin ants of magnetic anisotropy in \ncarbon nanotube preparati ons and showed that the anisotropic behavior \ndepends on the length and diamete r of the nanotubular structures and \nmay involve additional contributions from Ni nanoparticles fixed or \nadsorbed over the nanotube surface. Our results indicate, however, that \nthe relative content of paramagnetic metals or superparamagnetic nanoparticles, decreases significantly with the oxidation time, suggesting \na concomitant reduction in the propo rtion of bound metals to SWCNTs \nstructures. Thus, the maximal anisotro py is observed in preparations \ncontaining the largest proportion of SWCNTs and the smallest content of \nparamagnetic metals and superparama gnetic nanoparticles. Together, \npresent results suggest that the magnetic anisotropy of SWCNTs suspensions is dominated by the leng th and diameter of the carbon \nnanotubular structures, rather than by the co ntribution of free Ni or Ni \nnanoparticles, with a non-negligib le contribution of Ni+ or Ni \nnanoparticles bound to or interacting with, the nanotubular structures. \nWe believe these results open ne w avenues for the use of carbon \nnanotubes as directional contrast agents in MRI, as advanced probes to \ndetermine the three dimensional orientat ion of molecular assemblies in \nvivo and potentially to combine over the same nanoplatform, imaging 112 \n agents and therapeutic molecules. A pate nt covering these aspects has \nbeen filed [148]. \n  113 \n  \n \n \n \nConclusions \n   115 \n 1. I reviewed the contrast agents currently available for multimodal \nimaging applications, their ad vantages and limitations. This \nreview disclosed that the use of in novative strategies provided \nby Nanotechnology could improve the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of these molecules. On these grounds, I pursued the development of a novel \nsuperparamagnetic nanoparticle, its formulation as \nmagnetoliposome and the impl ementation of carbon nanotubes \nas anisotropic contrast agents for MRI. \n2. I developed and characterized Nanotex, a novel \nsuperparamagnetic nanoparticle containing an Fe\n3O4 core, with \npolyacrylic acid coating. Nanotex, has shown comparable \nmagnetic relaxivity properties, improved pharmacokinetics, \nreduced vascular retention and tissue accumulation and \nexcellent results when used in \u201cbolus tracking\u201d experiments of \nperfusion imaging with MRI.  Taken together, these results \nsupport further development of the particle, as a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. \n3. I implemented a new anti-infl ammatory nanoformulation based \nin magnetoliposomes containing Nanotex and \u03c9-3 PUFA-EE, with \nadvantageous properties as a theragnostic contrast agent. The \nparticle may be combined with a fluorescent probe to yield a multimodal theragnostic agent det ectable in vivo by MRI, \nfluorescence or both. This preparation demonstrated considerable antiinflamatory pr operties in a model of colonic \ninflammation and a previous ly unpredicted, outstanding \nantitumoral activity in a glioma model. 116 \n 4. I investigated the magnetic pr operties of Carbon Nanotubes, \nboth Single Walled and Multi Walled. I characterized the magnetic anisotropy observed in Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes as derived from the na notubular grapheme structure \nand its interaction with contaminant paramagnetic \nnanoparticles. Magnetooptical techniques demonstrate also \nmagnetic anisotropy of Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes, even at \nroom temperature. Magnetic Res onance Imaging confirms T\n2 \nrelaxation anisotropy for both types of Carbon Nanotubes at room temperature. \n5. In summary, I investigated, de veloped and proposed novel \ngenerations of nanotechnological  contrast agents suitable for \nfurther development in the mult imodal imaging market. \n  117 \n  \n \n \n \nBibliography    119 \n 1.
