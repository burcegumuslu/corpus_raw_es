The benefits are often far-reaching and long-lasting for patients. Integrative medicine can be an excellent tool for sustaining good health, as well as for treating chronic issues and painful or debilitating diseases and injuries.\nKey principles of integrative medicine\nUnlike alternative medicine which refers to an approach to healing that is used in place of conventional medical therapies, integrative medicine uses all appropriate therapeutic approaches to achieve optimal health and healing. The following are some of the key principles of integrative medicine:\n- A strong partnership between patient and physician\n- Use of both conventional and alternative medicines and modalities\n- A focus on non-invasive treatments when possible\n- A clear emphasis on promoting health and illness prevention through ongoing healthy living\nCombining therapies\nOver the last several decades, the popularity of combining conventional treatments with complementary therapies has grown tremendously. Patients and healthcare providers who were once skeptical of alternative treatments have become believers in the benefits of an integrative approach.\nIncreasingly, healthcare professionals who specialize in modern medicine are incorporating integrative medicine to promote health and wellness. By combining these approaches with conventional therapies, integrative practitioners can partner with patients and their primary healthcare providers to help relieve pain, reduce stress and support overall well-being.\nAnd, many healthcare providers themselves use integrative approaches for their own personal healthcare because of the distinct health and wellness benefits.\nCommon integrative health approaches used in integrative medicine\n- Deep breathing\n- Yoga\n- Tai chi or qi gong\n- Meditation\n- Massage\n- Functional nutrition\n- Homeopathy\n- Guided imagery\nWant to learn more about integrative medicine?
