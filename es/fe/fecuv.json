But we don't have to suffer any longer. In his bestseller Clean, the international leader in the field of integrative medicine revealed how many of these common ailments are the direct result of toxic build-up in our systems accumulated through daily living, and offered solutions for combatting them. Now, with Clean 7, Dr. Junger makes his groundbreaking program easier and more accessible than ever before. Clean 7 is his medically proven seven-day regimen that provides all the necessary tools to support and reactivate our bodies' detoxification system to its fullest capabilities. In one week, you can begin addressing those nagging health issues by discovering the foods that harm you and the foods that heal you, lose extra weight, and start to experience what it truly means to be well.The first seven days of any program are the most critical. Undertaking a new routine is stressful, and tests our commitment, willpower, and focus. Understanding exactly what's going on in your body--why you might feel fatigue on day two or cravings on day five--is the key to success. A doctor who's helped millions, Dr. Junger personally guides you through the process, offering a clear, day-by-day, meal-by-meal exploration of what's happening in your body to keep you focused on your goals.Filled with the latest science on the brain, and featuring delicious, nutritious recipes, and details on everything from prepping your kitchen to prepping your mind, Clean 7 revolutionizes the detoxification process. If you have been searching for a book or program to help you take that next step for your overall health, Clean 7 is the answer. Discover what it truly means to be healthy.", "language": null, "image": "https://images.cdn2.buscalibre.com/fit-in/360x360/04/28/04287baf78f3eee14bfe4b7a2f94d4bb.jpg", "pagetype": "product", "links": ["#", "https://www.buscalibre.co", "https://www.buscalibre.com.ar/libro-clean-7-supercharge-the-body-s-natural-ability-to-heal-itself-the-one-week-breakthrough-detox-program-libro-en-ingles/9780062792266/p/52772645", "https://www.buscalibre.cl/libro-clean-7-supercharge-the-body-s-natural-ability-to-heal-itself-the-one-week-breakthrough-detox-program-libro-en-ingles/9780062792266/p/52772645", "https://www.buscalibre.com.co/libro-clean-7-supercharge-the-body-s-natural-ability-to-heal-itself-the-one-week-breakthrough-detox-program-libro-en-ingles/9780062792266/p/52772645", "https://www.buscalibre.es/libro-clean-7-supercharge-the-body-s-natural-ability-to-heal-itself-the-one-week-breakthrough-detox-program-libro-en-ingles/9780062792266/p/52772645", "https://www.buscalibre.com.mx/libro-clean-7-supercharge-the-body-s-natural-ability-to-heal-itself-the-one-week-breakthrough-detox-program-libro-en-ingles/9780062792266/p/52772645", "https://www.buscalibre.pe/libro-clean-7-supercharge-the-body-s-natural-ability-to-heal-itself-the-one-week-breakthrough-detox-program-libro-en-ingles/9780062792266/p/52772645", "https://www.buscalibre.us/libro-clean-7-supercharge-the-body-s-natural-ability-to-heal-itself-the-one-week-breakthrough-detox-program-libro-en-ingles/9780062792266/p/52772645", "https://www.buscalibre.co/libro-clean-7-supercharge-the-body-s-natural-ability-to-heal-itself-the-one-week-breakthrough-detox-program-libro-en-ingles/9780062792266/p/52772645", "/ayuda", "/opiniones-clientes_st.html", "/", "https://www.buscalibre.co/v2/carro", "https://www.buscalibre.co/u#lista-deseos", "/v2/u", "javascript:;", "javascript:;", "/libros/autor/junger-alejandro", "/v2/centro-de-autores?idp=52772645", "/libros/editorial/harperone", "/libros/medicina/complementaria", "/libros/salud-relaciones-desarrollo-personal/familia-salud/medicina-popular-salud", "/libros/salud-relaciones-desarrollo-personal/familia-salud/forma-fisica-alimentacion/dietas-regimen-alimenticio-nutricion", "/afiliados/registro", "javascript:;", "javascript:;", "javascript:;", "javascript:;", "javascript:;", null, "https://www.buscalibre.co/libro-clean-7-supercharge-the-body-s-natural-ability-to-heal-itself-the-one-week-breakthrough-detox-program-libro-en-ingles/9780062792266/p/52772645", "javascript:;", "/libros/autor/junger-alejandro", "/v2/centro-de-autores?idp=52772645", "/libros/editorial/harperone", null, "/u", "/v2/u?rto=/pb/52772645", "/opiniones-clientes_st.html", null, null, null, "/v2/u?rto=/pb/52772645", "/opiniones-clientes_st.html", "/carro", "/", "https://apps.apple.com/cl/app/buscalibre/id1524316331", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buscalibre.app2", "/terms-and-conditions_st.html", "/politicas-de-devolucion_st.html", "/politicas-de-privacidad_st.html", "/ayuda", "/formas-de-pago-internacional_st.html", "https://www.buscalibre.co/opiniones-clientes_st.html", "https://www.buscalibre.co/cuentas-falsas_st.html ", "http://www.facebook.com/buscalibre", "https://www.instagram.com/buscalibre", "http://www.twitter.com/buscalibre", "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Eu0Mpw4meHnfX9T7H1e3h", "https://www.buscalibre.com.ar", "https://www.buscalibre.cl", "https://www.buscalibre.com.co", "https://www.buscalibre.es", "https://www.buscalibre.com.mx", "https://www.buscalibre.pe", "https://www.buscalibre.us", "https://www.buscalibre.co", "https://r5rh2u0m2h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ProdStage"]}
