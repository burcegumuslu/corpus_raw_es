HANDLE WITH \nEXTREME CAUTION. \nf Skin contact can cause irritation, burns, rash, and loss of \npigment. \nf Eye contact can cause irritation and burns. \nf Inhaling Sodium Cacodylate  can irritate the nose and throat \nand can cause an ulcer or hole in the \u201cbone\u201d (septum) \ndividing the inner nose. \nf Exposure to Sodium Cacodylate  can cause weakness, \npoor appetite, headache, and even death. \nf Sodium Cacodylate  may damage the nervous system and \nthe liver. \n \n \nWorkplace Exposure Limits \nThe following exposure limit is for organic  Arsenic compounds  \n(measured as Arsenic ): \n \nOSHA: The legal airborne permissible exposure limit (PEL) is \n0.5 mg/m3 averaged over an 8-hour workshift. \n \nf Sodium Cacodylate  is a CARCINOGEN in humans.  There \nmay be no safe level of exposure to a carcinogen, so all \ncontact should be reduced to the lowest possible level. \nf The above exposure limit is for air levels only.  When skin \ncontact also occurs, you may be overexposed, even though \nair levels are less than the limit listed above. \nSODIUM CACODYLATE            Page 2 of 6\n \nDetermining Your Exposure \nf Read the product manufacturer\u2019s Material Safety Data \nSheet (MSDS) and the label to determine product ingredients and important safety and health information about the product mixture.  \nf For each individual hazardous ingredient, read the New \nJersey Department of Health Hazardous Substance Fact Sheet, available on the RTK website (www.nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb ) or in your facility\u2019s RTK \nCentral File or Hazard Communication Standard file.  \nf You have a right to this information under the New Jersey \nWorker and Community Right to Know Act, the Public Employees Occupational Safety and Health (PEOSH) Act if you are a public worker in New Jersey, and under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) if you are a private worker. \nf The New Jersey Right to Know Act requires most \nemployers to label chemicals in the workplace and requires public employers to provide their employees with information concerning chemical hazards and controls. The federal OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200) and the PEOSH Hazard Communication Standard (N.J.A.C. 12:100-7) require employers to provide similar information and training to their employees. \n \nThis Fact Sheet is a summary of available information \nregarding the health hazards that may result from exposure. \nDuration of exposure, concentration of the substance and other \nfactors will affect your susceptibility to any of the potential \neffects described below.  \n \n \nHealth Hazard Information \nAcute Health Effects The following acute (short-term) health effects may occur \nimmediately or shortly after exposure to Sodium Cacodylate : \n \nf Skin contact can cause irritation, burns, itching, rash, and \nloss of pigment. \nf Eye contact can cause irritation, burns, and red, watery \neyes. \nf Inhaling Sodium Cacodylate  can irritate the nose and throat \ncausing coughing and wheezing. \nf Exposure to Sodium Cacodylate  can cause weakness, \npoor appetite, nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle cramps, and even death. \n \nChronic Health Effects \nThe following chronic (long-term) health effects can occur at \nsome time afte r exposure to Sodium Cacodylate  and can last \nfor months or years: \n \nCancer Hazard \nf Sodium Cacodylate  is a CARCINOGEN in humans.  There \nis evidence that Arsenic and Arsenic compounds  cause skin \nand lung cancer in humans. \nf Many scientists believe there is  no safe level of exposure to \na carcinogen \n \n Reproductive Hazard \nf There is limited evidence that Sodium Cacodylate  is a \nteratogen in animals.  Until further testing has been done, it should be treated as a possible teratogen in humans. \n \nOther Effects \nf Repeated skin contact can cause thickened skin and/or \npatchy areas of darkening and loss of pigment.  Some \npersons may develop white lines on the nails. \nf Long-term exposure can cause an ulcer or hole in the \u201cbone\u201d \n(septum) dividing the inner nose, hoarseness and sore eyes. \nf Sodium Cacodylate  may damage the nervous system \ncausing numbness, \u201cpins and needles,\u201d and/or weakness in the hands and feet.   \nf Sodium Cacodylate  may damage the liver. \n \n \nMedical \nMedical Testing \nBefore beginning employment and at regular times thereafter,  \n(at least annually), the following are recommended: \n \nf Exam of the nose, skin and nails \nf Test for urine Arsenic .  This is most accurate at the end of \nthe workday.  Eating shellfish or fish may elevate Arsenic  \nlevels for up to two days.  At NIOSH recommended \nexposure levels, urine Arsenic  should not be greater than \n100 micrograms per liter  of urine. \n \nAfter suspected overexposure, repeat these tests and consider \nan exam of the nervous system and liver function tests.  Also \nexamine your skin periodically for abnormal growths.  Skin \ncancer from Arsenic  can be easily cured when detected early. \n \nAny evaluation should include a careful history of past and \npresent symptoms with an exam. Medical tests that look for \ndamage already done are not a substitute for controlling \nexposure.  \nRequest copies of your medical testing. You have a legal right \nto this information under t he OSHA Access to Employee \nExposure and Medical Records Standard (29 CFR 1910.1020). \n \nMixed Exposures \nf More than light alcohol consumption can cause liver \ndamage.  Drinking alcohol may increase the liver damage caused by Sodium Cacodylate . \n \nConditions Made Worse By Exposure  \nf Many scientists believe that  skin changes, such as \nthickening and pigment changes, make those skin areas \nmore likely to develop skin cancer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n SODIUM CACODYLATE            Page 3 of 6\n \nWorkplace Controls and Practices \nVery toxic chemicals, or those that are reproductive hazards or \nsensitizers, require expert advic e on control measures if a less \ntoxic chemical cannot be subs tituted.  Control measures \ninclude:  (1) enclosing chemical processes for severely \nirritating and corrosive chemicals, (2) using local exhaust \nventilation for chemicals that may be harmful with a single \nexposure, and (3) using gener al ventilation to control \nexposures to skin and eye irritants.  For further information on \nworkplace controls, consult the NIOSH document on Control \nBanding at www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ctrlbanding/ . \n \nThe following work practices are also recommended: \n \nf Label process containers. \nf Provide employees with hazard information and training. \nf Monitor airborne chemical concentrations. \nf Use engineering controls if concentrations exceed \nrecommended exposure levels. \nf Provide eye wash fountains and emergency showers.   \nf Wash or shower if skin comes in contact with a hazardous \nmaterial. \nf Always wash at the end of the workshift. \nf Change into clean clothing if clothing becomes \ncontaminated. \nf Do not take contaminated clothing home. \nf Get special training to wash contaminated clothing. \nf Do not eat, smoke, or drink in areas where chemicals are \nbeing handled, processed or stored. \nf Wash hands carefully before eating, smoking, drinking, \napplying cosmetics or using the toilet. \n \nIn addition, the following may be useful or required: \n \nf Use a Class I, Type B, biological safety hood when mixing, \nhandling, or preparing Sodium Cacodylate . \nf Use a vacuum or a wet method to reduce dust during clean-\nup.  DO NOT DRY SWEEP. \nf Use a high efficiency particul ate air (HEPA) filter when \nvacuuming.  Do not use a standard shop vacuum. \n \n \nPersonal Protective Equipment \nThe OSHA Personal Protective Equipment Standard (29 CFR 1910.132) requires employers to determine the appropriate personal protective equipment for each hazard and to train employees on how and when to use protective equipment.  The following recommendations are only guidelines and may not apply to every situation.  Gloves and Clothing \nf Avoid skin contact with Sodium Cacodylate .  Wear \npersonal protective equipment made from material that can not be permeated or degraded by this substance.  Safety \nequipment suppliers and manufacturers can provide \nrecommendations on the most protective glove and clothing \nmaterial for your operation. \nf Safety equipment manufacturers recommend Nitrile and \nNatural Rubber for gloves and DuPont Tyvek\u00ae, or the \nequivalent, as protective material for clothing. \nf All protective clothing (suits, gloves, footwear, headgear) \nshould be clean, available each day, and put on before work. Eye Protection \nf Wear eye protection with side shields or goggles. \nf Wear a face shield along with goggles when working with \ncorrosive, highly irritating or toxic substances. \n \nRespiratory Protection \nImproper use of respir ators is dangerous.   Respirators \nshould only be used if the empl oyer has implemented a written \nprogram that takes into account workplace conditions, requirements for worker training, respirator fit testing, and medical exams, as described in the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134).  \nf For field applications check with your supervisor and your \nsafety equipment supplier regarding the appropriate \nrespiratory equipment. \nf Where the potential exists for exposure under 0.5 mg/m3 (as \nArsenic ), use a NIOSH approved negative pressure, air \npurifying, particulate filter respir ator.  The filter classifications \nof dust/mist/fume, paint spray or pesticide prefilters, and \nfilters for radon daughters, ha ve been replaced with the N, \nR, and P series.  Each series has three levels of filtering \nefficiency:  95%, 99%, and 99.9%. \nf Where the potential exists for exposure over 0.5 mg/m3 (as \nArsenic ), use a NIOSH approved supplied-air respirator with \na full facepiece operated in a pressure-demand or other \npositive-pressure mode.  Fo r increased protection use in \ncombination with an auxili ary self-contained breathing \napparatus operated in a pressu re-demand or other positive-\npressure mode. \n \n \nFire Hazards \nIf employees are expected to fight fires, they must be trained and equipped as stated in the OSHA Fire Brigades Standard (29 CFR 1910.156). \n \nf Sodium Cacodylate  may burn, but does not readily ignite. \nf Use dry chemical, CO 2, water spray or foam as extinguishing \nagents. \nf POISONOUS GASES ARE PRODUCED IN FIRE, including \nArsenic Oxide  and Arsenic fumes . \nf Use water spray to keep fire -exposed containers cool. \n \n \n               SODIUM CACODYLATE            Page 4 of 6\n \nFor more information, please contact: \n  New Jersey Department of Health   Right to Know   PO Box 368  Trenton, NJ 08625-0368  Phone: 609-984-2202  Fax: 609-984-7407  E-mail: rtk@doh.state.nj.us  Web address: http://www.nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb  \nThe Right to Know Hazardous Substance Fact Sheets \nare not intended to be copied and sold \nfor commercial purposes . Spills and Emergencies \nIf employees are required to clean-up spills, they must be \nproperly trained and equipped.  The OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard (29 CFR \n1910.120) may apply. \n \nIf Sodium Cacodylate  is spilled, take the following steps: \n \nf Evacuate personnel and secure and control entrance to the \narea. \nf Eliminate all ignition sources. \nf Moisten spilled material first or  use a HEPA-filter vacuum for \nclean-up and deposit in sealed containers.  \nf Ventilate and wash area after clean-up is complete. \nf DO NOT wash into sewer. \nf It may be necessary to contain and dispose of Sodium \nCacodylate  as a HAZARDOUS WASTE.  Contact your state \nDepartment of Environmental  Protection (DEP) or your \nregional office of the feder al Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) for specific recommendations. \n \n \nHandling and Storage \nPrior to working with Sodium Cacodylate  you should be \ntrained on its proper handling and storage. \n \nf A regulated, marked area should be established where \nSodium Cacodylate  is handled, used, or stored. \nf Sodium Cacodylate  is not compatible with OXIDIZING \nAGENTS (such as PERCHLORATES, PEROXIDES, PERMANGANATES, CHLORATES, NITRATES, \nCHLORINE, BROMINE and FLUORINE); STRONG BASES \n(such as SODIUM HY DROXIDE and POTASSIUM \nHYDROXIDE); and SODI UM BOROHYDRIDE. \nf Sodium Cacodylate  reacts with STRONG ACIDS (such as \nHYDROCHLORIC, SULFURIC and NITRIC) to form toxic Dimethylarsine gas . \nf Sodium Cacodylate  will corrode METALS (such as IRON, \nALUMINUM and ZINC) in the presence of WATER. \nf Store in tightly closed containers in a cool, well-ventilated \narea. \n \n \n \n \n \n               Occupational Health Information \nResources \nThe New Jersey Department of Heal th offers mult iple services \nin occupational health.
