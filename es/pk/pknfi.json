It is currently participating in the manufacture of the active substance, as well as the fill & finish for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. ROVI is specialised in the manufacture of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), which the WHO recommends as essential medicines for patients hospitalised in intensive care units due to COVID-19.\nThe EIB loan helps to accelerate ROVI\u2019s RD&I strategy by supporting the investments of this highly innovative company.\nThe financing will generate considerable positive externalities for the European pharmaceutical industry, contributing to the EU efforts to cover unmet health needs and secure qualified jobs.\n[Ricardo Mourinho F\u00e9lix, European Investment Bank Vice-President](https://www.eib.org/about/governance-and-structure/statutory-bodies/management-committee/members/ricardo-mourinho-felix.htm) said: \u201cThe EIB is committed to promoting RD&I investment in Spain whilst helping preserve skilled employment. A European company that can significantly contribute to the solution of the current and future pandemics provides a significant strategic advantage for Europe and Spain. I am pleased that this loan will help ROVI to contribute to the competitive search to enhance pharmaceutical knowledge in Europe in areas that are important for the improvement of the health of its citizens\u201d.\nJuan L\u00f3pez-Belmonte Encina, chairman and chief executive officer of ROVI, said, \u201cInnovation and research form part of our identity as a pharmaceutical company, given that we bet on solutions that improve people\u2019s health. At ROVI, we have a sound R&D strategy that makes us optimistic, since we hope that, as a result of the new launches, R&D will become one of the group\u2019s strategic drivers in coming years. Therefore, the fact that the BEI has again placed its confidence in us so that we can continue to progress with our R&D projects represents a great opportunity for our company\u201d.\nFinance for research and development activities\nThe EIB\u2019s loan will finance ROVI\u2019s R&D activities in various drug delivery technologies with a particular focus on psychiatry and oncology, and the development and improvement of products in the glycomic area. It will also support pre-clinical and clinical development (clinical trials, regulatory approvals) research and development, market access and international roll-out of the company\u2019s pipeline of in-house developed products.\nSecond EIB loan to ROVI\nROVI has been working with the EIB since 2017. Prior to this newly signed loan, the EIB had granted a EUR 45m loan to ROVI to finance its RD&I programme focusing on technologies for the administration and extended release of medication related to treatments to fight cancer and nervous system diseases.\n[ROVI ](http://www.rovi.es)is a pan-European pharmaceutical company specialising and engaging in the research, development, contract manufacturing and marketing of small molecules and biological specialties. The company, in a continuous international expansion process, has subsidiaries in Portugal, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and Poland, and has a diversified marketing portfolio of more than 40 products, among which its flagship product, Bemiparin, which is present in 89 countries all over the world, should be highlighted. Likewise, in 2017, ROVI commenced the marketing of its in-house developed enoxaparin biosimilar in Europe, which is now marketed in 38 countries. ROVI continues to develop its ISM\u00ae technology, a leading-edge line of research in the field of prolonged drug release with proven advantages.", "language": null, "image":
