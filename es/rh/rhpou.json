Please allow me to stress the two aspects which I \nconsider to have been of greatest importance in our work over these last twelve months.\nOn one hand, our scientific results are yet again excellent, thanks to you all. We are keeping up our level of \nproduction and quality in both publications and projects and we have also got some very good results as CIBERES in competitive calls. One good example of this could be the fact that in 2016 we were granted four of the nine applications for FIS projects presented by us, which represents double the results obtained in 2015, as well as a type I Miguel Servet contract, the only one granted to a CIBER area in this call.\nI would secondly like to highlight the work that we have done in developing a Strategic Plan to steer our \nwork until 2019. This Plan redefines both our mission and vision and our strategic objectives, which can now finally be expressed as follows:\nCIBERES Mission: to join forces to tackle respiratory diseases, by fostering excellence research and innovation \nand its prompt and safe transfer to clinical practice, encouraging training and compiling knowledge and research talent state-wide, as a driving-force research centre and benchmark in the field of respiratory diseases.\nCIBERES Vision: CIBERES  vision is to be an excellence network research centre on the international level, \ncompetitive, sustainable and a reference in the work done for prevention in the field of respiratory diseases.\nStrategic objectives:\n\u2022 Excellence research in respiratory diseases: encouraging excellence research in respiratory diseases \ncombining talent and the best human resources available state-wide.\n\u2022  Translational calling: contributing to solving problems in everyday clinical practice in the field of respiratory diseases.\n\u2022  International presence: encouraging participation and leadership of CIBERES research groups in international-scale research work.\n\u2022  Transfer of results in innovation: promoting the transfer of research results to society in general and to the production sector in particular.\n\u2022  Training: reinforcing the skills and competence of researchers in respiratory medicine: helping to increase their capacities for research and innovation and their competitiveness in respiratory diseases.\n\u2022 Dissemination and visibility: raising awareness about CIBERES, spreading news of its activities and main results of respiratory research to society.\nFerran Barb\u00e9, Scientific Director    44\u2022 Cooperation and alliances: establishing relations and stable synergies with public and private agents in \nthe field of respiratory medicine.\nOur work over the coming years will thus be focussed on attaining the objectives set, to which end I hope to \ngo on relying on your backing.\nCongratulations to you all for your excellent work and for your commitment to cooperative research.\nMany thanks.\n5\nOrganisation26661231236Organisational structure \nThe CIBERES is one of the thematic areas forming the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red (CIBER), a \nSpanish research consortium in the field of biomedical research with great scientific potential, under the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) \u2013 Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness. In 2016 it was made up of 8 thematic areas, which were extended to 11 in 2017.\nThe CIBERES is made up of 32 research groups, belonging to institutions of many different kinds: university \nhospitals, universities, Public Research Organizations (OPI), such as the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) itself and the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (CSIC), and research centres of Spain\u2019s regional \n\u2018autonomous communities\u2019 .\nCIBERES has a large team of human resources consisting of over 400 people, including a sizeable staff of its own \nresearchers and members of groups as personnel associated to the CIBERES. This extensive team is made up of basic and clinical biomedical researchers, research technicians and management staff.\nAs a thematic area of the CIBER, the CIBERES belongs to this public consortium and is thus governed by a \nGoverning Body and a Permanent Committee (its governing and management bodies) in which the institutions in the consortium take part. The organisational structure is made up of the Scientific Management, under Dr Ferr\u00e1n Barb\u00e9, which along with the Management Committee coordinates the work done by the three Scientific Programmes into which CIBERES groups are split. The CIBER Technical Unit provides the administrative support required for the Institution to run.\nSteering Committe Members \nThe Management Committee is presided over by the Scientific Director and made up of the coordinators of the programmes and manager of the CIBER.\nname Post\nferran Barb\u00e9 ill\u00e1 Scientific Director\nJes\u00fas ruiz-cabello osuna Scientific Assistant Director \nantoni t orres mart\u00ed Coordinator of the Infectious Disease Programme\nJuan f ernando masa Jim\u00e9nez Coordinator of the Respiratory Disease Programme\nfrancisco P\u00e9rez v izca\u00edno Coordinator of the Diffuse Respiratory Disease Programme\ncristina Prat a ymerich Coordinator of the Teaching Programme\nJavier Mu\u00f1oz Bravo Management of Scientific Programmes\nroser m\u00edas carballal Attached to Scientific Director\nmanuel s\u00e1nchez Delgado Manager\nExternal Advisory Scientific Committee\nThe External Advisory Scientific Committee is a body for scientific assessment and support, made up of relevant personalities in the field of health sciences standing out for their professional or scientific careers in line with the objectives of the Consortium.

At this event experts in different areas shared their knowledge on industrial property, company creation, licencing processes, venture capital, grants for internationalisation, etc.\n\u2022 Protection of the results of research and management of cooperation with other agents, as displayed by the application for patents and signing licence contracts, amongst other agreements.1111RES11 organisation Throughout 2016 eleven new patent applications and a registration of software were thus submitted at \nthe CIBER. Seven inventions are in the patentability study and one in the drafting stage, and these are expected to be submitted in early 2017.\n Apart from this, eight licence contracts have been signed. Furthermore, during 2016 several negotiations started and we expect to end successfully in the first quarter 2017. \n At CIBERES a licence contract was signed with a company in 2016.\n\u2022 The presentation of the results of research and technological capacities of our groups in technology transfer sessions. Among many other measures, and just as an example of this, CIBER had a stand and institutional presence at BIOSPAIN 2016 (28-30 September, Bilbao).\n\u2022 Support for technology-based company creation stemming from CIBER groups.\n\u2022 Other activities connected with innovation, public-private cooperation and industrial and intellectual property. As an example we could mention:\n- The call for Caixaimpulse 2016 projects at which a CIBERES project won an award.- Several MTAs (material transfer agreements) were signed, one with a company and thus with economic compensation for the CIBERES), CDAs (confidentiality agreements) and several scientific cooperation agreements as well as the ones mentioned).\n- Participation in internal and external forums and conferences.\nDissemination \nIn 2016 the CIBER\u2019S Communication Department performed different measures for dissemination and disclosure in order to raise awareness of the Centre, as well as to spread knowledge about the research work done by the groups in its eight thematic areas.\nThe main highlights of the Communication work done by CIBERES in 2016 are as follows:\n\u2022 The CIBERES in the media:\n In this period 67 CIBER press releases were published, 4 of these from the CIBERES and 1 in cooperation \nbetween several CIBER areas.\nDate thematic area title\n16/03/2016 CIBERESEl uso de viejos antibi\u00f3ticos con nuevos dispositivos para aerosolizar emerge \ncomo estrategia terap\u00e9utica en infecciones respiratorias graves\n04/07/2016 CIBERESLas apneas de sue\u00f1o de extrema gravedad parad\u00f3jicamente disminuyen el \nriesgo cardiovascular en pacientes obesos con insuficiencia respiratoria\n06/07/2016 CIBERESDise\u00f1an un sistema de uso sencillo para predecir el pron\u00f3stico de pacientes \ncon lesi\u00f3n pulmonar grave\n30/08/2016 CIBERESEl tratamiento con CPAP no previene los problemas cardiovasculares graves \nde pacientes con apnea de sue\u00f1o\n16/11/2016 VARIOS CIBEREl CIBER acerca su investigaci\u00f3n a la sociedad de la mano de la \nimprovisaci\u00f3n teatral en #ImproCiencia\n343 appearances in the media were also recorded:\n2016 news items audience\nCIBERES 343 26.691.40012121212312312\u2022CIBER\tNewsletter\nThis year 5 CIBER newsletters were edited and disseminated, including relevant content about the  \nCIBERES and other thematic areas.

The results are presented in SEPAR, ERS and ATS.19RES19  Scientific ProgrammesInfectious Respiratory  \nDiseases Programme\n  Coordinator: Antoni Torres  \nTuberculosis Line\nThe strategic programme on tuberculosis (TB) is focussed on:\nPrevention: the design of new candidates for vaccination: clinical development of MTBVAC; construction \nof multivalent live-attenuated vaccines based on three modern families of M. tuberculosis; design of a hyper-attenuated vaccine for the immunocompromised; new strategic therapies for preventing infection and active disease: methods for fast monitoring of the transmission of TB by genome sequencing and species-specific CRPs.\nDiagnosis: study of lesions caused by TB obtained by surgical procedures to seek biomarkers better \ncorrelating with TB pathology, clinical aspects, multi-resistance to drugs and prognosis; evaluation of new immunological and molecular tests for diagnosis of latent TB infection and disease: development of tests that are useful in low-income countries; integration of genomic and epidemiological strategies.\nTreatment: basic research and development of new anti-tuberculosis drugs; evaluation of therapies \naddressing the host; development of new approaches for studying pathogen-host interactions with new anti-tuberculosis formulations.\nHost-Pathogen Interactions Line\nThe host-pathogen interaction line works on identifying new therapeutic targets based on knowledge of the biological bases of infection for their later exploitation in the development of antimicrobials. To this end it uses multiple pathogen-specific approaches currently in the therapeutic discovery and/or preclinical evaluation phase. This line is having significant results in its three areas:\n\u2022 Genes of K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, influenza and Mycobacterium \nimplicated in patho-adaptive evolution during respiratory infection have been identified and/or characterised on the genomic and phenotypic level;\n\u2022 Strategies in eukaryotic subversion by Mycobacterium, K. pneumoniae, the influenza virus and RSV, and \nof immunomodulation by pulmonary surfactant have been characterised;\n\u2022 Progress has been made in the preclinical valuation of pulmonary surfactant proteins, natural polyphenols, aptamers and enzybiotics as antimicrobials, as well as in the optimisation of pharmacological release systems.\nIn 2016, the work done in this line generated 36 scientific publications, 2 patents, and gave rise to the defence of 7 doctoral theses.\nPneumonia Line \nThe \u201cPneumocoper\u201d project is the project of the Pneumonia Line Programme for the 2016-2018 period.

The main objectives of the Teaching Programme are:\n\u2022 To increase our researchers\u2019 basic, clinical and technological knowledge by creating synergies with \nreceiving organisations.\n\u2022 To increase the interest for research in respiratory diseases of young researchers in their training period to integrate these into CIBERES groups by fostering talent recruitment.\n\u2022 To further the mobility of research staff.\n\u2022 To boost researchers\u2019 intensification measures to enable the presentation of European/international projects.\nTraining Programme for Research Staff\nGRANTS FOR INITIATION TO RESEARCH\nThis programme proved to be of great interest as in earlier editions. The aim of the grants is to help young \nresearchers in their initial training to join a research programme financed by public institutions for one year and associate this with one of the CIBERES research groups. The official Programme for training research staff (FPI) keeps its co-financing ratio at 66%  by the teaching training programme and 33% by the receiving group itself.\nThanks to the increase in the budget, a further 2 calls for 9 grants were launched in 2016.\nImprovement and Mobility Programme\nIn 2016, a further line of action was added to the mobility programme focussing on co-financing the \nenrolment dues of Doctorate Programmes. 7 applications for payment of dues (500 \u20ac per application) and 3 applications for stays in another city were co-financed. Longer stays were encouraged with an increase in the economic endowment of the grants to 600 \u20ac per month plus 80% of the return trip, approving a further 2 applications (London and Toronto), which will be financed in 2017.\nIntensification Programme\nThe Intensification programme was proposed in order to strengthen Internationalisation at CIBERES, helping the researcher in drafting and submitting proposals for European/international projects. The final aim of this is to increase the input of external resources by raising the number of projects financed. 2 applications were presented in 2016.\nProgramme for Fostering Interest in Respiratory Research\nTRAINING SESSIONS\nOn 29 and 30 September 2016 the 9th Training Sessions were held in Madrid, at the Sala Auditorio of the \nCentro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC).\nOne innovation that we should mention was the participation of CIBERBBN researchers who shared \nthe presentation of 6 cooperative projects undertaken in the framework of CIBERES-CIBERBBN- SEPAR cooperation displaying the bonds already existing between the two CIBER areas. 48 junior CIBERES and CIBER-BBN researchers took part, presenting 10 oral papers and 38 posters, as well as the value contributed by senior researchers and managers.\n3 prizes for the best posters and oral communication were awarded as well as a special \u201cDr. Constancio \nGonz\u00e1lez\u201c prize for the most highly-considered oral paper.2525RES25  Transversal programmesInternationalisation Programme\n  Coordinator: Cristina Rodr\u00edguez  \nLast 11 May 2015 the CIBER Platform for Assistance for Internationalisation was set up. The Platform for \nAssistance for Internationalisation (PAI) came about as a joint initiative of the Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine areas (CIBER-BBN), Rare Diseases (CIBERER) and Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES), of the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red (CIBER), with the aim of underpinning and coordinating endeavours intended to promote its researchers\u2019 participation in European programmes and creating a common structure to further internationalisation and leadership of research and innovation in these three thematic areas.\nIn 2016 the platform focussed its work on two main areas: fostering the participation of CIBER groups in \ninternational projects and improving the international visibility of the CIBER.\nAs regards fostering the participation of CIBER groups in international projects and, in order to improve the \nquality of the proposals put forward, the PAI has carried out 4 specific events for disseminating the advantages of internationalisation and given 3\tspecific\tcourses on drafting and managing European projects intended for researchers and managers in the CIBER environment (Aspects of relevance in presentation and justification of European proposals in the CIBER environment\u201d (April 2016, with 70 persons attending) and \u201cDrafting successful cooperation proposals in the framework of H2020\u201d (Madrid edition. June 2016, with 40 attending, and Barcelona edition, September 2016, 44 attending) both a great success for all those taking part.\nIn order to raise the quality of the proposals and improve returns the PAI got under way a Service for editing \nproposals which has carried out the following activities: 1) Solving doubts and positioning of proposals (contrasting the scientific idea with that of the call and issuing a grounded report with recommendations on how to adapt the idea, need for strategic partners, etc\u2026) the PAI has received over 27 enquiries in this respect. 2) Edition of proposals (PAI has edited over 20 proposals). 3) Evaluation of results (in previous proposals or those not sent through the PAI), giving a grounded criticism of the result and proposing where there is room for improvement (12 requests in the period). 3) Search for strategic partners (6 requests in this period, plus 6 external partners who got in touch with CIBER to propose joint cooperation).\nThanks to this, in 2016\tCIBER\tput\tforward\t36\tnew\tproposals,\t4\tnew\tprojects\tbeing\tgranted. Expressions of \ninterest were received for the presentation of 10 new proposals. In this field it should be stressed that CIBER has received 5 new contacts from research groups or companies in order to set up agreements for joint presentation of proposals in the H2020 setting, and currently 2 of these contacts have materialised in the real presentation of two H2020 proposals.\nIn the field of the CIBER\u2019S international visibility, the CIBER has done some intensive work by attending over \n18 events (including informative sessions, infodays and events for seeking partners). The platform also placed special stress on establishing a smooth relationship with the different national representatives, national points of contact, by means of specific meetings, acting as a point of contact on the institutional level. In order to improve international presence, specific meetings were held with NCPs and with the head of the H2020 programme in order to establish smoother relations. Thanks to this increase in communication, CIBER\twas\tinvited\tto\tthe\tForum\tfor\tstrategic\tdefinition\tof\tthe\tWp2018-2020 and took an active part in defining the 2017 work programmes and IMI calls as scientific experts. It was also decided to include postulating CIBER for participation\tin\tjoint\tmeasures\tJA-01,\t02,\t03,\t04,\t05-2016 in which it was offered the possibility to take part in measures as associated centres. It should be stressed that thanks to the campaign for recruiting experts promoted by the PAI, CIBER has included over 15 new profiles in the Cordis database and has promoted updating the existing ones. As a result of this work CIBERER researcher Carmen Ayuso was selected to form part of the group of experts in ethics and scientific integrity, in the framework of the programme Science with and for Society of the 2020 Horizon (SwafS-ethics), while researchers Mercedes Serrano and Isabel Varela, recently created profiles, were contacted to take part as assessors. 262627\nPlatforms528282812312328Pulmonary Biobank Consortium\n  Coordinator: Germ\u00e1n Peces Barba  \n  Head: Cristina Villena  \nMost relevant milestones in 2016:\n\u2022 Improvement of external visibility:\n- Development and publication of new web page addressing researchers and donors.\n- Drafting and distribution of new updated triptychs.\n- Attendance at scientific events (sessions for training researchers,  university master courses, meetings \nof experts in respiratory pathologies), and in cooperative activities (congresses, dissemination work, projects, etc.).\n\u2022 Increase in collection of deficient samples (lung explants, organ donors, other collections), with 6781 new samples being collected.\n\u2022 Management and inclusion of the multicentre collection of over 900 patients recruited in the ISAAC project, coordinated by the Obstructive Sleep Apnoea line of CIBERES and SEPAR.\n\u2022 Increase in the requests for samples, both internal and external, with a rise in the number of projects requiring prospective collections.\n\u2022 Cooperation and compliance with the objectives undertaken with the National Biobanks Network Platform of the AES 2013 (PRNB), taking part in its 5 work programmes.\n- Member of the management committee - PRNB.\n- Member of the quality commission - PRNB.\n- Co-coordination of the R+D+i in human tissue Line (Programme 3: Research, Development and Innovation).

During 2016 I publish 51 original publications. In addition, it received funding in competitive calls for the development of 22 new research projects and 18 clinical trials. The projects develop the objectives of the CIBERES 2016-18 Sleep Line, being: i) To characterize different SAHS phenotypes and to improve the management of the disease. Ii) To evaluate the impact of SAHS and its treatment in the development of comorbidities with high mortality and high social impact. He has obtained recognition of the Caixaimpulse program for the development of the first technology for application of personalized medicine in the SAHS, which evaluates the response to CPAP treatment in patients with resistant hypertension and SAHS. The papers have been published in the first journal of the category of Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems (Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC)) and recognized with Best Publication of the SES 2016. Moreover, it has led nationally, The most relevant international study so far for evaluating the impact of CPAP treatment on secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The results were published in New England Jounal or Medicine. In addition, in 2017, the first global study, conducted by Group 35, was completed to determine the prevalence of sleep disorders in COPD. Group 35 continues its involvement in the development of several simplified device transfer contracts for the diagnosis of SAHS.

Only, after a proper etiologic diagnosis and antimicrobial susceptibility it is possible to apply a proper antimicrobial treatment and to convey an antimicrobial stewardship. Our lines of research are mainly oriented to the end of providing rapid and adequate orientation for treatment of pneumonia in more patients and more rapidly. Our definition for rapid etiologic diagnosis is to provide etiology and antimicrobial treatment orientation within 8 hours after the reception of the clinical samples in the microbiology department.\nOur achievements during 2016 with this orientation were the following:\n\u2022 PNA-FISH in Lower Respiratory Tract Infections: This is a one hour rapid procedure (1 hour) using a beacon-based fluorescent in situ hybridisation (bbFISH) method to identify the major pathogens causing in LRT samples.  \n\u2022 The utility of assessing S. aureus colonization in patients admitted to a Major Heart Surgery Intensive Care Unit (MHS.ICU). We evaluated the nasal carriage of S. aureus upon admission to a MHS-ICU, comparing the yield of conventional cultures versus rapid molecular test. / The rapid method can be provided in less than 2 hours. \n\u2022 Rapid identification of microbial pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility using mass spectrometry  (MALDI-TOF). We have been able to use this technique to improve de rapid diagnosis of bloodstream infections, pulmonary mycosis, urinary tract infections and other.  \n\u2022 The spectrum of disease caused by Respiratory Sincitial Virus in adults.

Lung surfactant not only protects the lung against alveolar collapse during the breathing cycle but is involved in host defense. The manner in which surfactant components might participate in successful elimination of microorganisms without triggering excessive inflammatory response in the alveolus is still poorly understood. How biophysical surfactant properties and host defense mechanisms can be interdependent is also unknown.The focus of our group is to understand how surfactant lipids and proteins exert their action. We study:1.  Pulmonary surfactant:\n a) Evaluation of the mechanisms of surfactant membranes resistance to alteration/inactivation. b)    Characterization of compositional and functional changes in pulmonary surfactant during respiratory disfunction.\n2.  Alveolar defense mechanisms against infection and inflammation:\n a) Study of the molecular mechanisms through which pulmonary collectins SP-A and SP-D modulate the inflammatory response of alveolar macrophages to pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli. b)     Determination of the mechanism through which SP-A acts in synergy with antimicrobial peptides to combat infection and modulate inflammation elicited by respiratory pathogens. c) Analysis of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the action of the lipid component of pulmonary surfactant in  Universidad Complutense de madrid \n Facultad de Biolog\u00eda\n Ciudad Universitaria, s/n\n 28040 Madrid\n (+34) 91 394 42 61  \n ccasalsc@ucm.es  \n group website \nPROGRAMMES\nInfectious Respiratory Diseases \n48\nRESlimiting infection and modulating immune activation of alveolar macrophages.\n3.

Principal Investigator: Cristina Casals. \nRELEVANT RESUL TS: \n\u2022 Line 2: (i) SP-A inhibits [IFN-g+LPS]-induced classical activation of macrophages; (ii) binding of SP-A to IFN-g abrogates IFN-g effects on human macrophages; and (iii) SP-A amplifies IL-4-induced macrophage proliferation and alternative activation, revealing an important role of SP-A in respiratory diseases with high levels of IL-4, such as asthma or fibrosis. Additionally, (iv) SP-A exhibits an antimicrobial synergic action with both endogenous and exogenous antimicrobial peptides against different Gram-negative bacteria; (v) the formation of SP-A/antimicrobial peptide complexes is required for such synergistic activity; and (vi) the complexes cross the cell wall and translocate to the periplasmic space, where they interact with the cytoplasmic membrane. \n\u2022 Line 3: In an animal model of HDM-induced allergic airway inflammation SP-A/surfactant lipid ratio is increased. Since SP-A potentiates IL-4 action on macrophages, but lipids inhibit them, the elevated SP-A/lipid ratio may increase IL-4 effects in the alveoli during allergic inflammation. \n\u2022 Line 4: SP-A-coated mannosylated nanoparticles exhibit a greater internalization by alveolar macrophages than non-SP-A-coated nanoparticles. This suggests that this formulation could be useful as a vehicle of anti-tuberculosis drugs.\nDOCTORAL THESIS: \n19/12/2016.

Frontiers in Physiology. 2016;7(JUL).\nHighlights\nThe group has focused its work on two of the programs of CIBERES, addressed to study obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and acute lung injury (ALI). Part of the group research has been carried out in the framework of contracts with companies and of two funded joint-projects with CIBER-BBN groups. A first main outcome in the field of OSA has been the development and characterization of a novel chip system capable of realistically simulating the main OSA stimuli at cell level. The chip allows cell application of controlled fast patterns of intermittent hypoxia and cyclic stretch at breathing and heart frequencies. A prove of concept application study on bone marrow-derived stem cells was carried out. In another study, we found that circulating exosomes modulate cancer progression (proliferation, migration and extravasation) in a mouse model of sleep fragmentation mimicking OSA, potentially explaining the adverse cancer outcomes observed in OSA. Concerning OSA treatment, we developed a novel bench test setting to test automatic CPAP devices. The model allows simulating a patient\u2019s night including different breathing features in each sleep phase. In the ALI program, the group has focused on the studying the crosstalk between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM). On the one hand, we used a mouse Marfan model (mutation in ECM fibrillin) to document that alterations in the ECM may induce distinct the micro- and macro-mechanical mechanical changes in the lung. In addition, we have provided novel evidence of different mechanisms driving isolated and collective cells migration in the presence of non-homogeneous ECM stiffness (durotaxis). We found that collective durotaxis is far more efficient than single-cell durotaxis, appearing as a potential robust mechanism to direct cell migration in lung epithelial/endothelial repair in ALI.   \n51 research groups\nleaD researcher\nGarc\u00eda L\u00f3pez, Ernesto\nGROUP MEMBERS \nStaff\tmembers:\tRuiz Garc\u00eda, Susana \nAssociated members: D\u00edez Mart\u00ednez, Roberto | Domenech Lucas, Mirian | Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, Pedro  | \nMoscoso Naya, Miriam | Ramos Sevillano, Elisa | Yuste Lobo, Jos\u00e9 Enrique \nMain lines of research\nIt is noteworthy that 65\u201380% of chronic bacterial infections are caused by microbes growing in biofilms. The \ntolerance of these communities to antibiotic therapy is well known. Firm evidence also links biofilms both to chronic and acute lung infections, as exemplified by cystic fibrosis and ventilator-associated pneumonia, respectively. The nasopharynx and the lungs are involved in constant and essential chemical signaling among the local microbiota, and between this and both local and systemic tissues critical to human physiology. The healthy nasopharynx and lungs are colonized by different microorganisms that form mixed biofilms: 1) encapsulated pneumococci associate with non-typeable pneumococci (NTPn), strains of S. pseudopneumoniae and/or non-typeable H. influenzae in the nasopharynx;  2) bacteria belonging to the phyla Firmicutes (mainly Streptococcus), Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in lungs. We are currently studying the requirements (microbiological and otherwise) for in vitro mixed biofilm formation between S. pneumoniae and other bacterial pathogens.Pathogenic bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to the classic antibiotics used with much success in recent decades. Among the few alternatives currently envisaged for treating this problem are phage endolysins (also called enzybiotics), which are modular enzymes that hydrolyze specific peptidoglycan bonds of susceptible bacteria. In the laboratory we test new endolysins mainly targeted against respiratory pathogens, obtained from phage origin or by construction of chimeras resulting from the fusion of different functional domains.

For several years, our projects have focused on the cardiovascular comorbidity of OSA (hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, pulmonary hypertension and venous thromboembolic disease), although recently we are also addressing its metabolic repercussion (type 2 diabetes) and the association between apnea and cancer.

Our activity focuses on the identification of different triggers, the characterization of the asthmatic reaction, the description of molecular mechanisms of eosinophil activation and the definition of the biochemical and genetic mechanisms responsible for occupational asthma.\n\u2022 Regulation of the innate immune system in chronic respiratory infections\n We pretend to recognize the molecular mechanisms of cell signaling responsible for the development of endotoxin tolerance, mainly in patients with COPD, cystic fibrosis and non-CF bronchiectasis. We are also particularly interested in the identification of several immunosuppression pathways of macrophages, natural \nkiller cells and T cells in these patient groups.\nMost relevant scientific articles\n\u2022 Torres-Capelli M., Marsboom G., Li Q.O.Y., Tello D., Rodriguez F.M., Alonso T. et al.

Among other achievements until now, we have described the role of HIF2alpha in the sensing pathway in bronchial epithelial club cell proliferation. One of the main results obtained in sleep apnea is its identification as a risk factor for the recurrence of embolic episodes in patients with venous thromboembolic disease, which raises interesting clinical implications about the suppression or continuity of anticoagulation in this group of patients. Above all, we have contributed to the review of pathogenic pathways for deregulation of carbohydrate metabolism in patients with OSA and we have demonstrated a mid-term effect of CPAP on glycemic control in patients with OSA and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.In airflow limitation, we have generated the first results of our participation in a European project for the identification of lung function alterations in smokers with ischemic heart disease and we have described new routes of allergic sensitization in the children and in occupational asthma. In turn, we have provided information about the development of alterations in the symptomatic perception of obese individuals, who could simulate asthma. In this line, members of the group have participated in the preparation of the Spanish Guide for Asthma Management (GEMA 4.0) and the European recommendations for bronchial provocation with food.In the innate immune system, we have provided information on macrophages reprogramming mechanisms in the context of chronic infections and we have obtained an integrated project of excellence of the ISCIII about endotoxin tolerance, which is coordinated by a group member.\n55 research groups\nleaD researcher\nGea Guiral, Joaquim\nGROUP MEMBERS \nStaff\tmembers:\tCasadevall Fust\u00e9, Carme | Guitart de la Rosa, Maria\nAssociated members: Admetllo Papiol, Mireia | Balcells Vilarnau, Eva | Barreiro Portela, Esther | Curull \nSerrano, Victor | Dom\u00ednguez \u00c1lvarez, Marisol | Ferrer Monreal, Antonio | Galdiz Iturri, Juan Bautista | Mart\u00ednez Llorens, Juana Mar\u00eda | Mateu Jim\u00e9nez, Merc\u00e8 | Orozco Levi, Mauricio | Puig Vilanova, Ester | Rodr\u00edguez, Diego Agust\u00edn\nMain lines of research\n\u2022 Muscle disorders in COPD and other lung diseases \n Most of our work focuses on the study of muscle abnormalities secondary to the different circumstances and factors present in patients with COPD and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyle, hypoxia, hypercapnia, ventilatory loading, inflammation and oxidative stress. In this regard our group has described the specific effects of several of these factors both in respiratory and limb muscles, using patients\u2019 samples and animal models. In the last period, we are mostly devoted to the study of the probable defects in muscle repair present in the above mentioned diseases.\n\u2022 Phenotyping COPD patients\n There are also several of our recent studies searching for new key molecules that can explain part of the pathophysiology of COPD, and eventually serve as biomarkers of some of the traits that characterize the different subtypes of COPD patients or even help on the search of new therapeutic targets. The most ambitious project is BIOMEPOC, a multicenter study investigating potential biomarkers using different \u2018omic\u2019 approaches. In addition, new therapeutic targets for COPD may eventually be identified.  consorci mar Parc salut  \nde Barcelona\n Hospital del Mar\n Paseo Maritimo, 25-29\n 08003 Barcelona\n (+34) 93 248 35 48  \n jgea@parcdesalutmar.cat\n group website \nPROGRAMMES\nChronic Respiratory Diseases\n56\nRES\u2022 Molecular\tlinks\tbetween\tCOPD\tand\tLung\tCancer\n Our group is interested in investigating the mechanistic relationships between COPD and the onset \nof lung cancer, using both patient samples and animal models reproducing both entities.

FI 9.108\nHighlights\nIn 2016 our group has published numerous research papers, highlighting those belonging to its classical research lines (muscle abnormalities in COPD and other chronic diseases, relationships between COPD and lung cancer, and pulmonary hypertension). The incorporation of a senior researcher to our group has added a new line, focused in the study of several disorders present in critically ill patients. Furthermore, the first step of the \u2018omics\u2019 analysis from the CIBERES project BIOMEPOC has been carried out. This is one of the main studies of the program on Chronic Respiratory Diseases (COPD line), and has facilitated the extension of our collaborations to bioinformatic groups from other research institutions. There are also collaborations with groups of CIBER BBN, which are focused on the development of instruments to monitor respiratory muscle function. Regarding translational activities it should be mentioned that we currently have two patented instruments that are currently commercialized (Europe and America). On the other hand, in the past year we participated in the elaboration and publication of the SEPAR recommendations for the management of lung cancer patients, and in a guide for the study of autophagy. An important and recent addition to the group has been our second CIBER postdoctoral investigator, an action that will undoubtedly boost our future research actions. In terms of projects, two actions were submitted to the EC 2020 Horizon program and both have been positively evaluated in the initial thematic selection. One of them would eventually be coordinated by CIBERES. As for postgraduate teaching, 4 doctoral theses from our group have successfully been defended in 2016, and 5 more are ongoing.\n57 research groups\nleaD researcher\nGonz\u00e1lez Mangado,  \nNicol\u00e1s\nGROUP MEMBERS \nStaff\tmembers:\tFern\u00e1ndez Arias, Jos\u00e9 | P\u00e9rez Rial, Sandra | Rodr\u00edguez P\u00e9rez, Noelia\nAssociated members: Fern\u00e1ndez Ormaechea, Itziar | Gomez Garc\u00eda, Mar\u00eda Teresa | Peces-Barba Romero, \nGerm\u00e1n | Rodr\u00edguez Nieto, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas | Seijo Maceiras, Luis Miguel | Su\u00e1rez Sipmann, Fernando | Troncoso Acevedo, Mar\u00eda Fernanda | Villar \u00c1lvarez, Felipe\nMain lines of research\n\u2022 Sleep Disorders: Central SA and cardiac disease.

The solid safety data and immunogenicity of the first clinical trial in humans with MTBVAC in Phase 1a in adults in Lausanne Switzerland were critical in initiating the Phase 1b safety study in newborns in South Africa, an endemic country with one of the highest incidences of tuberculosis in the world. The vaccination phase of the babies ended in September 2016 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02933281) and immunity results are expected by the end of 2017. In the line of TRANSPOSITION and MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TUBERCULOSIS project FIS 12/1970 was closed, and FIS 15/0317 started. The characteristics of the isolates of the most relevant tuberculosis complex in our environment and the different polymorphisms in their genomes were determined. The study of Beijing strains of Community Canaria was started. The genome of a M. bovis isolate XDR \u201cB\u201d has been published. We started with transcriptome studies. A \u201cSNaPShot\u201d pyrosequencing technique was performed and an ampliTaq faster and easier to perform technique which, in turn offers the molecular resistance profile of the isolate, and its phylogeny is being designed.In the line of MOLECULAR BASIS OF DRUG RESISTANCE IN MYCOBACTERIA, during 2016 works on European project MM4TB have finalized, and positive results have been achieved in the analysis of the role of efflux in the activity of several new families of antituberculosis compounds. Based on previous works that resulted in the identification of a polymorphism specific of Beijing strains in a gene encoding an efflux pump, we have worked for simplifying the protocol for detection, which may facilitate its implementation in the clinic. Concerning other series of antituberculosis compounds, we have continued with its characterisation, in particular we have worked on drugs under development combined with nanoparticles.\n65 research groups\nleaD researcher\nMasa Jim\u00e9nez,  \nJuan Fernando\nGROUP MEMBERS \nStaff\tmembers:\tIglesias Rom\u00e1n, Mar\u00eda Vanessa | Pereira Sol\u00eds, Ricardo\nAssociated members: Alonso \u00c1lvarez, Maria Luz | Corral Pe\u00f1afiel, Jaime | Disdier De Vicente, Carlos | \nGallego Dom\u00ednguez, Rocio | Garc\u00eda Ledesma, Mar\u00eda Estefan\u00eda | G\u00f3mez De Terreros Caro, Francisco Javier | Riesco Miranda, Juan Antonio | Rubio Gonz\u00e1lez, Manuela | S\u00e1nchez Escu\u00edn, Julio | S\u00e1nchez Quiroga, Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles | Ter\u00e1n Santos, Joaqu\u00edn\nMain lines of research\n\u2022 Respiratory disorders and sleep apneas during sleep.\n\u2022 Noninvasive ventilation treatment in acute and chronic settings.\n\u2022 Lung cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n\u2022 Telematic diagnosis in respiratory medicine.\n\u2022 Tobacco quit and treatment. funDesaluD \n Hospital San Pedro  de Alcantara\n Avda.

From 2011 there has developed a wide basic activity that can be considered to be seminal. Always based in 2 lines, the basic one co-working with the group of the Prof. Navajas and the clinic one with the Spanish Group of Sleep disorders (SEPAR) that have focused on the analysis of the melanoma. Actually, our group with the Profs. Navajas and Alcaraz (Urology Depar of the Hospital Clinic) has begun a new line of original investigation on the cancer and DARES. It is a question of analyzing the role of IT her DARES in the renal cancer. In this respect already there have been obtained very new publications (Vilaseca et to. J Urol. 2017). \n\u2022 Our group has another important objective. Specifically and as the apneas are considered a systemic disease, our studies attempt to assess the effect of the OSA in other organs. Currently the group that works in the context of the Cyber-SAHS line explores the effect of the OSA in the CKD and the Microbiome instestinal already with initial results (Moreno-Indias Sleep 2016).\n\u2022 The most important line that the group takes to out today is the telemedicine applied to the OSA. Both in monitoring, early works (Isetta et to the Thorax) as in the context of the creation of a virtual unit of sleep completely either ranging from diagnostic treatment and follow-up procedures using new information and communication technologies to work with primary. Those initial results were already presented (London ERS or SEPAR congresses) endorse this new form of work, very innovative, as good and cost effective.

The first one, started in 2013 and whose researcher is Javier Milara, is entitled: Study of the Janus Kinasa 2 / STAT3 route as a pharmacological target in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and associated pulmonary hypertension: preclinical and translational analysis, financed project by Health Research Fund ISCIII. The second of them, whose investigator in charge is Julio Cortijo was initiated in 2015 and your title is: New anti-inflammatory drugs in COPD and asthma. Study in models of in vitro corticoresistencia financed by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and finally the last one initiate also in 2015 and whose responsible investigator is Esteban Morcillo has as its title: Pharmacological modulation of signaling inflammation-remodeling by isoform-selective inhibitors of PDE4 and Comparators in relevant in vitro human models in COPD financed by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.On the other hand during this year also has participated in projects of private financing. The first one was based on the differential effects of Advanced Compound with comparators; panPDE4B inhibitor, selective PDE4B inhibitor, selective PDE4D inhibitor, roflumilast N-oxide and corticosteroids on leukocyte/ endothelium interactions in in vitro models relevant to COPD financed by Gr\u00fcnenthal GmbH. In the second, the analysis of Mucociliary Clearance of test compounds using microCT-SPECT-Tc99m albumin nanocolloids in Guinea Pig. Project financed by Almirall. Finally, the study of effects of NOX4 inhibitors on primary fibroblasts from IPF patients; an in vitro study, a project financed by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited company, is currently underway.In addition to the projects mentioned, the group has participated in events of scientific diffusion among them in the congress of the European Respiratory Society and two doctoral theses have been presented as well as 4 end-of-degree / master\u2019s degrees.\n75 research groups\nleaD researcher\nMu\u00f1oz Gall, Xavier\nGROUP MEMBERS \nStaff\tmembers:\tOjanguren Arranz, \u00cd\u00f1igo\nAssociated members: \u00c1lvarez Fern\u00e1ndez, Antonio | Bravo Masgoret, Carlos | Cruz Carmona, M\u00aa Jes\u00fas | De \nGracia Rold\u00e1n, Javier | Ferrer Sancho, Jaime | Genover Llimona, M\u00aa Teresa | G\u00f3mez Olles, Susana | Lloberes Canadell, Patricia | Mart\u00ed Beltr\u00e1n, Sergi | Monforte Torres, V\u00edctor | Mravitilles Fern\u00e1ndez, Marc | Orriols Mart\u00ednez, Ram\u00f3n | Roca Gas, Oriol | Rodr\u00edguez Gonz\u00e1lez, Esther | Rom\u00e1n Broto, Antonio | Romero Santo Tom\u00e1s, Odile | Ruano Burgos, Laura | Sampol Rubio, Gabriel | Untoria Corral, M\u00aa Dolores | Venrell Belat, Montserrat \nMain lines of research\n\u2022 The activity of basic and clinical research of the group focuses mainly in areas of inflammation and repair, respiratory failure and tissue hypoxia, and there is complementarity and interrelation of these areas for the study of diseases such as asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, infections, transplants, pulmonary hypertension and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). \n\u2022 Specifically, within the research in asthma the group is working in the MEGA project aimed at increasing knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of asthma as well as to study the parameters that can determine long-term changes in the patient\u2019s condition and treatments that can influence the progression of the disease. In short, the group aims to better understand the natural history of disease in order to reduce its incidence. We believe that the key to a better understanding of asthma is to carry out an integrated approach, in which immunological, genetic and environmental factors that define the relevant characteristics of the disease are analyzed.\n\u2022 In the line of pulmonary fibrosis, our studies have shown that it is possible to determine the causes of this disease in half of the cases after the completion of a clinical study in depth. The group has shown that a major cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is exposure to minimal but persistent antigen quantities. Ultimately, it is the disease called hypersensitivity pneumonitis cr\u00f3nica. In this research the group has a murine model of hypersensitivity pneumonitis that will be significant in the near future to see the effect of different treatments as well as to study the pathophysiological pathways of this disease.\n\u2022 Our center is currently one of the 7 hospitals in the country where lung transplants are performed and one of the most active in this field, which places it in one of the top European and world level. With the unique opportunity generated by the lung transplant program at our hospital, the group is actively working on the inclusion of samples in the CIBERES biobank.  fundaci\u00f3n hospital \nUniversitario Vall d\u2019Hebron - Institut de Recerca (VHIR) \n Hospital Vall d\u2019Hebron\n Passeig Vall d\u2019Hebron, 119-129\n 08035 Barcelona\n (+34) 93 489 40 48  \n group website \nPROGRAMMES\nChronic Respiratory Diseases \n76RESMost relevant scientific articles\n\u2022 Miravitlles M., Vogelmeier C., Roche N., Halpin D., Cardoso J., Chuchalin A.G. et al .

Dr. Sampol has also directed the clinical practice guide on the use of DAM in the treatment of OSAS, which has been completed in 2016 and is yet to be published. In the field of occupational / environmental pathology, the group has been involved in the development of the SEPAR asbestos disease normative and in the European Society of Allergy (EAACI) Task Force on hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Allergy. (6): 765-79). In the lung transplantation line, the group has participated in an international study that has demonstrated the relationship of air pollution with mortality and the occurrence of chronic graft dysfunction in patients with transplanted lung. The research has been published in the European Respiratory Journal. The Ciberes Asthma Program is carrying out a multi-center project (MEGA Project) for which it has funding from the Carlos III Health Institute. The group has published more than 60 articles during 2016, has several projects funded by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, SEPAR, SOCAP, FUCAP etc. (See report) and has directed three doctoral theses.\n77 research groups\nleaD researcher\nNieto Mart\u00edn, Amelia\nGROUP MEMBERS \nStaff\tmembers:\tMarcos Villar, Laura | Pazo Fern\u00e1ndez, Alejandra\nAssociated members: Falc\u00f3n Escalona, Ana | Melero Fontdevila, Jos\u00e9 Antonio  \nMain lines of research\n\u2022 Mechanism of influenza virus interaction with the host cell. \n\u2022 Mecahnisms of pathogeinicity of influenza virus.\n\u2022 Study of human respiratory syncityal virus and metapneuomovirus glycoproteins. agencia estatal consejo \nSuperior de Investigaciones \nCient\u00edficas \n Centro Nacional de Biotecnolog\u00eda.\n Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid.

In addition, we have continued with the structural, antigenic and immunogenic characterization of Pneumoviridae fusion proteins with the aim of designing a universal vaccine for this family of viruses. \u2022 Cellular\tproteins\tthat\tinteract\twith\tinfluenza\tvirus\tpolymerase\tproteins\n We have characterized the interaction of two transcription-related proteins with influenza virus \npolymerase. One is hCLE, a positive modulator of the RNAP II, and the other is CHD1, a chromatin \nremodeler. Both, positively modulate influenza virus replication and moreover, hCLE is incorporated into influenza virus particles. \n\u2022 Modulation\tof\tinfluenza\tvirus\treplication\tby\tantiviral\tagents\t\n We have used DNA aptamers that impair the interaction between influenza virus polymerase with components of the cellular translation machinery. Their use decreases viral replication and can be useful tools as potential antiviral compounds. \n We have shown that influenza virus downregulates the unfolded protein response mediated by the PERK sensor, while Montelukast, a drug used to treat asthma in humans, specifically stimulates this response and downregulates viral protein synthesis and multiplication. Hence, our studies suggest that \nmodulation of the PERK-mediated unfolded protein response is a target for influenza virus inhibition.\n\u2022 Effect\tof\tinfluenza\tvirus\tinfection\ton\tchromatin\tremodelers\tand\tepigenetic\tchanges\tinduced\tin\t\nthe infected cell.\n We have studied the epigenetic changes of the cellular chromatin that take place during infection. DNA methylation is not modified, but histone modifications are altered. A general decrease in histone acetylation is observed and an increase in H3K79 methylation. Inhibiting the specific methylase of this residue we have observed that it controls the antiviral response and therefore influenza virus replication. \n\u2022 generation and characterization of respiratory syncytial virus (RSv) and metapneumovirus (MPv) chimeric fusion proteins.\n Based on previous structural studies of both RSV and MPV F glycoproteins, chimeric molecules were designed in which antigenic sites were swapped between the two molecules. Thus, soluble forms of postfusion MPV F with RSV antigenic site II and prefusion RSV F with MPV antigenic site IV were made and expressed from vaccinia recombinant viruses. The purified chimeric proteins showed the expected antigenic properties, as probed with monoclonal antibodies, and were capable of inducing cross-reactive and cross-neutralizing antibodies in mice. These results represent a proof of concept for a human Pneumoviridae universal vaccine.  \n79 research groups\nleaD researcher\nObeso Caceres, Ana\nGROUP MEMBERS \nStaff\tmembers:\tGordillo Cano, Ana | Olea Fraile, Elena\nAssociated members: Agapito Serrano, Mar\u00eda Teresa | Gallego Mart\u00edn, Teresa | G\u00f3mez Ni\u00f1o, \u00c1ngela | Rigual \nBonastre, Ricardo Jaime | Rocher Mart\u00edn, Asunci\u00f3n | Yubero Benito, Sara \nMain lines of research\n\u2022 Obstructive sleep apnea and systemic effects: multifactor study in an animal model of Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia.\n\u2022 Chronic intermittent hypoxia (OSA model) and spontaneous tumorigenesis in a murine model\n\u2022 Animal model of pulmonary hypertension associated with sustained chronic hypoxia: vascular characterization.\n\u2022 New role of carotid body arterial chemoreceptors in the pathophysiology: arterial hypertension and metabolic syndrome.

We demonstrate for the first time that chronic intermittent hypoxia is a risk factor promoting the spontaneous appearance of tumors in different tissues, and significantly in the lung, in a murine aging model. Sexual dimorphism is confirmed in the onset and progression of pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic hypoxia in a rat model. The role of carotid body (CB) in glucose homeostasis and in insulin sensitivity in rat adipose and hepatic tissue has been demonstrated.The group has collaborated in activities organized by CIBERES, participating (Asuncion Rocher as a member of the CIBERES Teaching Commission) in the organization of the 9th CIBERES Training Days, Collaborative Projects with CIBERBNN, held in the Auditorium of the National Cardiovascular Research Center Carlos III (CNIC), Madrid 29-30 September.

Our interest is mainly focused on the mechanisms involved in pulmonary vasodilation and inhibition of cell proliferation in order to identify and design new drugs that are potentially useful in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.\n\u2022 Acute lung injury (ALI ) or its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS ) is characterized by pulmonary edema and alveolar collapse leading to severe arterial hypoxemia. Although the protective ventilatory support strategies have improved the prognosis of patients, the associated mortality remains unacceptably high. Our interest is to characterizie the pulmonary vascular inflammatory response associated with acute lung injury and the identification of therapeutic targets to improve prognosis in these patients.\n\u2022 Our research work is focused in analyzing different signaling pathways involved in these pathologies: 1) Sphingolipids, components of the plasma membrane of all eukaryotic cells whose hydrolysis products (ceramides and sphingosine) play a key role in various signal transduction pathways. 2) Innate immunity receptors and danger-associated molecular patterns. 3) microRNAs Universidad Complutense de madrid\n Facultad de Farmacia\n Ciudad Universitaria, S/N\n 28040 Madrid\n (+34) 91 394 14 77  \n fperez@med.ucm.es \n group website \nPROGRAMMES\nChronic Respiratory Diseases \nDiffuse\tRespiratory\tDiseases\nInfectious Respiratory Diseases \n82\nRESMost relevant scientific articles\n\u2022 Pandolfi R., Barreira B., Moreno E., Lara-Acedo V., Morales-Cano D., Martinez-Ramas A. et al.

A SR & MA on aerosolized antibiotics was concluded, with two seminal publications (Clin Microbiol Infect & Resp Care), in collaboration with Epidemiology CIBER & Cochrane Foundation being part of the PCI Pneumonia WP5. Collabaoration with IMI- Europena COmission Programme is part of the Internacionalization. We have been invited to lead an international task force for an institutional docuemnt on sepsis management. The International Journal of Infectious Disease Editor has requested a document to fix the \u201cResearch Agenda on Ventilator-associated pneumonia\u201dSome RCT on antibiotiocs have been performed and reported, enclosing a phase II RCT on a vaccine with nosocomial indication. This trial and the activity on personalized medicine had meda impact (enclosing CIBERES Web:  http://www.ciberes.org/noticias/nueva-estrategia-para-prevenir-con-vacunas-las-infecciones-respiratorias-de-adquisicion-hospitalaria  y http://www.ciberes.org/noticias/medicina-personalizada-en-pacientes-con-gripe ). Three doctoral thesis were read and 8 are ongoing. One post-doct stage (J. Riera) has been done in Hannover (T Welte) to improve research skills on ECMO and Lung Transplant. We get a positive evaluation to get a post-doct from Marie Curie Programme re-incorporated to Spain. Eight additional thesis were ongoing (three with International Mention Doctor, with stages in University of Toronto, Liverpool, and Mexico). For second year, we directed a module of the VHIR translational Master. Multicenter study of prevalence of asynchronies in chronic home ventilation, with a semiautomated diagnostic platform is ongoing. We requested a research grant to AGAUR from CIBERES. We get, with collaboration of a Rio Hortega fellow, a SEPAR grant, for an innovation of biomarkers in respiratory infections.\n87 research groups\nleaD researcher\nRuiz Cabello Osuna, Jes\u00fas\nGROUP MEMBERS \nStaff\tmembers:\tSantos Oviedo, Arnoldo de Jes\u00fas \nAssociated members: Arias Gued\u00f3n, Teresa | Benito Vicente, Marina | Bilbao Luri, Izaskun | Espa\u00f1a \nPalomares, Samuel | Filice, Marco | Herranz Rabanal, Fernando | Izquierdo Garc\u00eda, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds | Lechuga Vieco, Ana Victoria | Mateo De Castro, Jes\u00fas | Pellico Saez, Juan | Rodr\u00edguez Ram\u00edrez de Arellano, Ignacio | Velasco Jimeno, Carlos | Villa Valverde, Palmira\nMain lines of research\nThe group is integrated in the Advanced Imaging Unit (AIU) that was established in the Spanish National Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging in early 2012. It is a multidisciplinary group focused in developing new imaging applications and molecular imaging developments that will expand the molecular and cellular knowledge of the different cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. With this aim our research is focused on 1) Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Imaging 2) Nanomedicine and radiochemistry and 3) Metabolomics. The group offers the scientific community state of the art imaging technologies including five modalities: MRI, X-ray CT, nuclear imaging (PET), ultrasound (echocardiography) and optical (bi and tri-dimensional luminescence and fluorescence). In the field of Nanomedicine the group encompasses a nanotechnology and organic chemistry laboratory in which we develop new nanoparticles, molecular probes and biofunctionalization techniques for the diagnosis and treatment of different cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Currently our group produces multifunctional nanoparticles for all imaging techniques available at our institution, like Iron Oxide, liposomes, Up-converting Nanophosphors and Gold Nanoparticles, all of them functionalized with different cardiovascular and pulmonary biomarkers. Additionally, a new 68Ga (and from beginning of 2014) 89Zr radiochemistry laboratory is fully operative to provide specific  fundaci\u00f3n centro nacional \nde Investigaciones Cardiovasculares \n c/ Melchor Fdez.

Finally, the group also has a long experience in the application of \nmetabolic analysis to the study of different pathologies, by the use of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry and different statistical tools developed within the group. Our research projects range from technical developments and chemistry advances to in vitro studies and tracking biological processes in vivo.\nMost relevant scientific articles\n\u2022 Santos A., Rivas E., Rodriguez-Roisin R., Sanchez M., Ruiz-Cabello J., Arismendi E. et al .

During this year 2016, we have obtained another initiative joint project with other members of Ciberes, such as the project awarded by the Department of Health of the Government of Navarra obtained from Dr. Junkal Garmendia Garc\u00eda. The different research members that constitutes the group 31 have obtained two more projects in 2016, funded respectively by the Carlos III Health Institute (PI-DTS-2016-0059) within the technological innovation program and another from the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (SAF2016- 79593-P).We have presented different proposals to the H2020 framework, e.g. an ERA-NET (Euronanomed) as coordinators and to a ERC-Advanced program. Finally, in collaboration with the group of Dr. Germ\u00e1n Peces-Barba and a group from the Massachusetts General Hospital of Boston we have presented a joint initiative to the ROI call from the USA National Institutes of Health. From the technological aspects of our research, we have filed for an European patent for methodology of erythrocyte labeling as a Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-based diagnostic tool with special relevance in the field of pulmonary hypertension and respiratory distress.\n89 research groups\nleaD researcher\nTorres Mart\u00ed, Antoni\nGROUP MEMBERS \nStaff\tmembers:\tAguilera Xiol, Elisabet | Fern\u00e1ndez Barat, Laia | Li Bassi Li Bassi, Gianluigi | Motos Galera, \nAna | Sancho Roset, Elisabeth\nAssociated members: Agust\u00ed Garc\u00eda Navarro, Carlos | Almirall Pujol, Jorge | Badia Jobal, Juan Ram\u00f3n \n| Bello Dronda, Salvador | Bodi Saera, Mar\u00eda Amparo | Falguera Sacrest, Miquel | Ferrer Monreal, Miguel | Guerrero Molina, Laura | Huerta, Arturo | Mart\u00ednez Olondris, Pilar | Men\u00e9ndez Villanueva, Rosario | Ram\u00edrez Galleymore, Paula | Rodr\u00edguez Oviedo, Alejandro | Sellares Torres, Jacobo | Sirvent Calvera, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda | Soler Porcar, N\u00e9stor | Soy Muner, Dolores\nMain lines of research\n\u2022 Animal Model\n\u2022 Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)\n\u2022 Bronchiectasis non-associated to Cystic Fibrosis (BQ-noFQ), Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and immune deficiencies\n\u2022 Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\n\u2022 Ventilator associated-pneumonia Hospital Cl\u00ednico y Provincial de Barcelona \n Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona\n Villarroel, 170\n 08036 Barcelona\n (+34) 93 227 55 49  \n atorres@ub.edu  \n group website \nPROGRAMMES\nChronic Respiratory Diseases\n90\nRESMost relevant scientific articles\n\u2022 Torres A., Ranzani O.T., Ferrer M.
