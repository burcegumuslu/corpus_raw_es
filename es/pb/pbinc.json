It's free.\nDr. Robin Bernhoft has Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), an illness he describes as \u201cmisunderstood and controversial\u201d that affects\n[up to 25%](https://www.mold-help.org/mold-toxicity-and-mcs/) of the U.S. population.\nBernhoft also is the parent of a vaccine-injured child and the author of research papers on the link between autism and vaccines.\nIn an interview with\n[The Defender](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/), Bernhoft, an allergy and immune specialist with more than 46 years in the medical field, discussed MCS, vaccines, [autism](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/autism-cdc-media-vaccine-related-harm/), [COVID](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/), and how profit and politics have warped medical care in America.\nBernhoft is director of the Bernhoft Center for Advanced Medicine in Ojai, California, and past president of the American Academy of Environmental Medicine.\nHe also is the author of more than 28 publications, including three books, and has testified at more than 60 trials as an expert witness in the field of environmental medicine and the treatment of MCS.\n[MCS-Aware](https://www.mcs-aware.org/), an advocacy organization, defines MCS as \u201ca chronic, physical illness affecting people of all ages and backgrounds.\u201d\nMCS-Aware states:\n\u201c[MCS] causes sufferers to have allergic-type reactions to very low levels of chemicals in everyday products. Put simply the immune and detoxification systems stop working properly and the body cannot process toxins efficiently.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good working definition,\u201d Bernhoft said.\nHe added:\n\u201cMCS is found in people who react with exposure to any\n[chemical](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/big-chemical/) \u2014 car exhaust, perfume, paints, household chemicals, even new plastics in household items and chemicals in new clothing \u2014 with a variety of symptoms, including headache, respiratory distress, extreme fatigue and neurological symptoms, such as brain fog, dizziness and vertigo.\u201d\nBernhoft described MCS as a disease in which the detoxification pathways of the human body become compromised due to genetics or environment, or a combination of the two.\n\u201cThe body is like a rain barrel \u2014 you fill it up with toxic stuff and eventually it overflows with symptoms,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the\n[ National Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/issues/toxic-chemicals), more than 80,000 chemicals have been introduced into our environment since 1945. Very few of these were adequately tested for their impact on human health.\nIn individuals with MCS, Bernhoft said, the body\u2019s detoxification pathways are less than genetically ideal, so they are more susceptible to having difficulty detoxifying chemicals commonly \u2014 and increasingly \u2014 found in our environment.\nThe most common triggers for MCS are petroleum-based solvents, volatile organic compounds, pesticides and synthetic fragrances.\nOne fragrance alone\n[can contain](https://www.ecomall.com/greenshopping/mcs.htm) up to 600 petroleum-based chemicals, and because ingredients are considered a trade secret, manufacturers don\u2019t have to divulge what those chemicals are.\nLaboratory analysis of common fragrances shows they contain\n[ extremely toxic chemicals](http://www.herc.org/news/perfume/scents.htm), including chemicals on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s [Hazardous Waste list](https://archive.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/web/pdf/listing-ref.pdf).\nPeople with MCS are anywhere from 100 to 1,000 times\n[ more sensitive](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/15/fragrance-sensitivity-why-perfumed-products-can-cause-profound-health-problems) to synthetic fragrances than are healthy people, Bernhoft said.\n\u201cI consider MCS patients to be the \u2018canary in the coal mine\u2019 for our toxic environment,\u201d said Bernhoft.\nMCS \u2018ended my career as a surgeon\u2019\nBernhoft, who said he has had MCS since 2000, described how the condition changed his life and career.\nIn the 1990s, he said, he was a successful liver and pancreatic surgeon in Seattle, having done his fellowship in London at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital \u2014 a \u201cmember of the elite club in medicine of practicing/teaching surgeons.\u201d\nBut then he developed allergies to all the approved soaps for pre-op disinfection.\n\u201cI would get a red rash or hives or open sores,\u201d Bernhoft said. \u201cIt ended my career as a surgeon and set me on the path of environmental medicine.\u201d\nEventually, the allergy to the soaps developed into MCS. Bernhoft began to have debilitating headaches in response to perfumes, car exhaust and other chemicals in the environment.\nHis experiences led him to retrain in allergy and environmental medicine and to question many of the assumptions of conventional Western medicine in terms of both theory and practice.\nAs Bernhoft wrote on his\n[website](https://www.drbernhoft.com/dr-bernhofts-story):\n\u201cIncreasingly, evidence suggests that human illness is both more complicated than we thought, yet also simpler. It turns out that our genes are not destiny, merely suggestions. \u2018The genes cock the gun, but the environment pulls the trigger.\u2019\n\u201cThe expression of genetic information is influenced by lifestyle, diet and various environmental factors. Many toxic environmental factors can be successfully removed. Many defective genes can work better with the proper cofactors or with upgrading of backup enzymes. When these things happen, diseases can be improved, sometimes eliminated altogether.\n\u201cWhile it is not possible to cure everyone, it is possible to improve or eliminate many \u2018untreatable\u2019 chronic conditions. Seventy-five percent of America\u2019s health care bill is consumed [by] throwing pills at the symptoms of chronic disease \u2014 but money is better spent going after causes, as they do in Europe and Japan.\u201d\nIn his recovery and in his practice, Bernhoft said he relies on a combination of treatments for MCS to relieve the immune system\u2019s toxic burden and improve its functioning.\nThese include infrared sauna, chelation, high-quality nutritional supplementation and dietary changes to detoxify the body.\nHe also uses an immunological treatment called \u201clow-dose antigen therapy\u201d that is highly effective and safe in treating a wide variety of allergic reactions, including reactions to chemicals.\n\u201cLow-dose antigen (LDA) treatment is the standard of care for all allergies in the UK and has had some impact in Europe,\u201d Bernhoft said. \u201cBut it is not recognized by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI).\u201d\n\u201cAmerican allergy doctors use an approach to allergies developed during the first World War,\u201d said Bernhoft, adding that in contrast, LDA treatment was introduced in the 1970s.\nHe said:\n\u201cIt\u2019s a more recent and far safer technology. The typical allergy shots that most American allergists give can lead to serious side effects, including two dozen deaths in an average year. The LDA shots have few side effects and no recorded fatalities since 1973.\u201d\nBernhoft said the issue for American allergists with the LDA approach is not one of efficacy or safety, but one of profit.\n\u201cThe LDA shot is one shot every seven to eight weeks, whereas the typical course given by an American allergist is one or two shots per week,\u201d Bernhoft said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy enough to do the math on the greater profits to be had with the latter approach.\u201d\nIn fact, Bernhoft said the AAAAI successfully lobbied insurance companies to cover the standard regimen of weekly allergy shots but not to cover the far-less-expensive LDA shots.\nThat means MCS patients, for whom the standard allergy treatment offers no help, must pay out of pocket for the LDA treatment, while standard allergy patients (including those with dust and pollen allergies) must submit to the more expensive, more dangerous approach to receive medical treatment covered by their insurance, Bernhoft said.\nAs someone afflicted with MCS, this reporter can personally attest to the efficacy of the LDA treatment.\nAutism triggered by toxic exposure, including vaccines\nBernhoft also has treated vaccine-injured children and researched the causes of autism.\nIn a\n[ 2008 paper](https://www.drbuttar.com/patientresources/autism/MultiSystem.pdf), Bernhoft and his colleague, Rashid Buttar, argued autism \u2014 not unlike MCS \u2014 is a multi-system oxidative and inflammatory disorder, triggered by a toxic exposure and almost always coupled with genetic factors affecting the body\u2019s detoxification capacity:\n\u201cWhat environmental factors might be causative? The two leading suspects would seem to be neurotoxic chemicals and\n[heavy metals](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/chd-tv-empower-zen-honeycutt-brent-wisner-monsanto-baby-food-heavy-metals/), probably in some synergistic combination.\n\u201cThe Second National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals paints a grim picture of maternal and fetal exposures to multiple chemicals and metals.\n\u201cA small study by Edelson and Cantor found 100% of autistic subjects had deficient liver detoxification ability, as assessed by the usual excretory tests, and 90% had high levels of many neurotoxic chemicals. In Edelson\u2019s earlier study, all the subjects also had evidence of unusually high levels of heavy metals.\u201d\n\u201cMercury has been suspected for some time to play a role in autism, in part because of the inclusion of thimerosal in several vaccines,\u201d Bernhoft wrote, \u201cand in part because the apparent increase in autism rates paralleled the increase in mercury-containing immunizations.\u201d\nBernhoft and Buttar summarized findings showing the two sets of symptoms for mercury poisoning and autism symptoms to be almost \u201cperfectly superimposed\u201d in a Venn diagram.\n\u201cVaccines can be one source of exposure to these neurotoxic chemicals and heavy metals that cause autism,\u201d said Bernhoft.\nHe also pointed out that while mercury supposedly was removed from all childhood vaccines, except for the flu vaccine, a lab analysis six years ago showed\n[thimerosal](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/child-health-topics/known-culprits/vaccines-culprit/poison-in-our-vaccines-investigating-mercury-thimerosal-and-neurodevelopmental-delay/) was found in several vaccines \u201ceven though it was not listed on the ingredients label.\u201d\nIn treating autism, Bernhoft uses protocols that include chelation, to remove the heavy metals from the patient\u2019s body.\n\u201cMy clinical experience is that when you detox the mercury and other heavy metals from kids with autism, they do a lot better,\u201d Bernhoft said.\nHe recounted his experience with one 4-year-old whose parents reported had not spoken since his autism diagnosis:\n\u201cWe had chelated him for about a year, and one day he came into the office for treatment and he looked me in the eye [autistic children do not typically make eye contact] and said, \u2018Hi, Dr. Bernhoft! I am feeling a lot better.\u2019\u201d\nBernhoft has seen this sort of improvement replicated in many of his patients, including his own son. He\n[ published](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Mercury-Toxicity-and-Treatment%3A-A-Review-of-the-Bernhoft/dcb79de82c53236ecae2ed5bfbd55ccb81649d73) his recommendations for the chelation and detoxification of autistic patients.\nBernhoft said the sooner the detoxification protocol is begun, the greater the chance for improvement, as the toxins can be removed before they cause permanent damage.\nBernhoft also studied the genetic profile of children with autism.\n\u201cThe study was published in 2008 but it has since been removed from the PubMed archives, as have two similar studies by university pediatric researchers,\u201d he said.\nBernhoft\u2019s research found a high correlation between autism and some genetic abnormalities that make it difficult for the body to detoxify:\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a big deal [the genetic abnormality] and the irony of it is that if you did the genetic testing beforehand, you could weed out the kids that are going to become autistic and pretty much wipe out the disease, but that would be really bad for vaccine sales.\u201d\nCOVID vaccines and treatment: \u2018Not that hard to make numbers say what you want them to say\u2019\nIn his interview with The Defender, Bernhoft also discussed COVID treatments and vaccines.\n\u201cAnyone who has read\n[Bobby Kennedy\u2019s book](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Anthony-Fauci-Democracy-Childrens/dp/1510766804) knows effective treatments \u2014 such as [ivermectin](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/ny-times-mislead-public-ivermectin-study/) and IV vitamin C mega-dose supplementation \u2014 have been suppressed in order to fast-track the Emergency Use Authorization,\u201d said Bernhoft.\n\u201cBy law, they cannot emergency authorize a vaccine if successful treatments already exist for the disease in question,\u201d he added.\nTo avoid a possible shutdown of his office by California\u2019s medical authorities, Bernhoft stopped prescribing ivermectin for patients with COVID.\nBernhoft said there is increased scrutiny in California of medical exemptions for vaccines in the wake of\n[ 2019 legislation](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB276) that gave greater authority to the state medical board to review exemptions granted by physicians.\n\u201cIn 2018 I wrote three medical exemptions \u2014 two for a history of anaphylactic reaction, and one for a patient with a history of\n[Guillain-Barr\u00e9](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/shelby-allen-teen-guillain-barre-covid-vaccine/) paralysis, which both are okay with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [as a rationale for exemptions] \u2014 but I am currently under an accusation from the California State Medical Board for having written these,\u201d he said.\nIn addressing claims that COVID vaccines are \u201csafe and effective,\u201d Bernhoft recounted an incident in his own research career when the supervisor of his research simply removed some of the data from a study, telling him \u201che didn\u2019t like those numbers.\u201d\nThe result was completely different after the data were removed. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard to make the numbers say what you want them to say,\u201d said Bernhoft.\nHe also said\n[ some studies of hydroxychloroquine](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/meryl-nass-tessa-lena-under-attack/) were deliberately set up to fail:\n\u201cThe normal dose of hydroxychloroquine for lupus or arthritis is 400 to 600 mg per day. The drug can be toxic to the heart at higher doses. Also, it has to be administered in the first week to be effective for COVID.\n\u201cOne study gave the drug to people who were in the ICU and had been sick [with COVID] for three or four weeks. The dose they gave was 2400 mg, and guess what? The subjects died of cardiac arrhythmias.\u201d\n\u201cOur current medical system, including much of our purportedly scientific research, is captured by the interests of pharmaceutical companies who put profits ahead of patients,\u201d said Bernhoft.", "language": null, "image": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/multiple-chemical-sensitivity-feature.jpg", "pagetype":
