Es probable que la batalla con COVID -19 contin\u00fae durante meses a nivel mundial. Por lo tanto, \nse necesitan m\u00e1s estrategias adem\u00e1s de la contenci \u00f3n y la mitigaci\u00f3n para su llegada a cualquier zona, \nespecialmente aquellos pa\u00edses con infraestructura de salud poco desarrollada, para acortar la estancia \nhospitalaria y reducir el consumo de recursos sanitarios (Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud, 2020a).  \nEn la actualidad , el COVID -19, al ser un  virus recientemente identificado, tiene opciones de tratamiento \nfarmacol\u00f3gico limitadas . La Medicina Tradicional China tiene un buen potencial para complementar las \nnecesidades existentes, pudiendo ser una buena op ci\u00f3n adicional considerando las opciones limitadas \ndisponibles para COVID -19 (Chan et al, 2020). En China, la Medicina China  se propone como una opci\u00f3n de \ntratamiento de alto uso seg\u00fan las directrices nacionales y provinciales . Se revisaron las \u00faltimas gu\u00ed as cl\u00ednicas \nnacionales y provinciales, estudios de cohorte retrospectivos, series de casos sobre el tratamiento de COVID -\n19 con la Medicina China como tratamiento complementario, entre otros.  L os datos disponibles sugieren que \nMedicina China  podr\u00eda consid erarse como una opci\u00f3n terap\u00e9utica complementaria en el tratamiento de \nCOVID -19. La estrategia debe enfocarse en ir al origen del problema para acortar la duraci\u00f3n de la fiebre, \naliviar los s\u00edntomas, prevenir la progresi\u00f3n de la enfermedad, reducir la mort alidad y ayudar a la recuperaci\u00f3n. \nLa evidencia actual indica que la MTC  tiene un beneficio potencial en el alivio sintom\u00e1tico, acortando la \nduraci\u00f3n de la fiebre, revertiendo los cambios radiol\u00f3gicos y acortando la estancia hospitalaria (Lu et al., \n2020a;  Xia et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020).  \nPara el tratamiento del COVID -19 con MTC, la directriz nacional estableci\u00f3 varios periodos; el periodo de \nobservaci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica, el per\u00edodo de tratamiento (leve, intermedio, grave y cr\u00edtico) y el periodo de recuperaci\u00f3n. \nEn cada periodo y fase se recomiendan f\u00f3rmulas fitoterap\u00e9uticas de Medicina china y acupuntura. Las \ndirectrices provinciales se optimizaron en funci\u00f3n de las directrices nacionales para la adaptaci\u00f3n local, la \nmayor\u00eda involucraban medidas preventivas y de tratamiento de Medicina china (Chen et al., 2020b; Pang et \nal., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020).  \nLa utilizaci\u00f3n de  la Medicina china en la gesti\u00f3n de l COVID -19 ha sido  muy significativa  en China (Gao et al., \n2020). Los casos confirmados de COVID -19 en Shanghai c omenzaron el tratamiento integral de Medicina China  \ny la Medicina O ccidental (Yuan et Qiu, 2020). En Guangdong, los gr\u00e1nulos de Tou-jie-qu-wen  (neumon\u00eda n.\u00b01) \nse evaluaron con una serie de casos y se recomendaron a 30 hospitales designados como el tratamiento \nest\u00e1ndar de los pacientes con COVID -19 (Administraci\u00f3n de Produc tos M\u00e9dicos de Guangdong, 2020) . En \ngeneral, m\u00e1s del 85% de los casos confirmados involucraron el uso de MTC  a nivel nacional (Wuhan m\u00e1s del \n67%) (Le y Liang, 2020; El Consejo de E stado, la Rep\u00fablica Popular de China, 2020b) y el primer Hospital M\u00f3dulo \ndesignado orientado a MTC  en Wuhan funcion\u00f3 desde el 14 de febrero de 2020 (Wang  y Li, 2020).  \nSon varios los estudios puestos en marcha, a partir del 22 de febrero de 2020, hab\u00eda tres  cohortes \nretrospectivas (Lu et al., 2020a; Xia et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020), cinco series de casos (Cheng y Li, 2020; Dai \net al., 2020 ; Administraci\u00f3n de Productos M\u00e9dicos de Guangdong, 2020; Administraci\u00f3n Nacional de Medicina \nTradicional China, 2020 b; Yong et al., 2020), y dos estudios de caso (Hu et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020b) sobre la \ngesti\u00f3n integrada con Medicina China y Medicina Occidental del COVID -19. \nA partir del 22 de febrero de 2020, se registraron 24 y 141 estudios de intervenci\u00f3n relac ionados con COVID -\n19 en ClinicalTrials.gov y Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, respectivamente, incluyendo la Medicina China. De los \n53 ensayos cl\u00ednicos relacionados con Medicina China , 27 ensayos eval\u00faan los programas de  Medicina China y  \ntratamiento integr ado.   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           3 \n La acupuntura  y moxibusti\u00f3n juega n un papel activo en la prevenci\u00f3n y el tratamiento de enfermedades \ninfecciosas , habiendo participado activamente f rente a l COVID -19, en la prevenci\u00f3n y el control, logra ndo \nbuenos resultados, y estableci\u00e9ndose las Directrices sobre Intervenci\u00f3n de Acupuntura y Moxibusti\u00f3n para el \nCOVID -19 (Guidelines on Acupuncture and Moxibustion Intervention for COVID -19 (second edition) ). \nEn la lucha contra la pandemia de neumon\u00eda causada por la infecci\u00f3n del COVID -19, el Hospital Provincial de \nMedicina Tradicional China de Hubei utiliz\u00f3 diligentemente las especialidades de la Medicina China, en \ncooperaci\u00f3n con los departamentos pertinentes  para estudiar y formular programas de prevenci\u00f3n y \ntratamiento de la neumon\u00eda, estableciendo protocolos de acupuntura y moxibusti\u00f3n para la prevenci\u00f3n y el \ntratamiento del coronavirus. Se puso de manifiesto que la fitoterapia china jug\u00f3 un papel important e en los \nresultados positivos del tratamiento. Las f\u00f3rmulas herbales chinas albergan el potencial \u00fanico de reducir los \ns\u00edntomas de la fiebre y la tos, limitar la progresi\u00f3n de la enfermedad y mejorar la inmunidad general y, por lo \ntanto, la capacidad de un a persona de generar una respuesta inmune esencial al virus, debi\u00e9ndose integrar en \nun plan de tratamiento integral que utilice tanto la medicina occidental como la china para garantizar \nresultados \u00f3ptimos para el paciente. Los resultados de la colaboraci\u00f3 n entre la medicina occidental y la china \nen Wuhan han sido muy prometedores (Chen et al., 2020).  \nSon varias las Gu\u00edas publicadas en China sobre la MTC y el COVID19 y varias las noticias que resaltan los buenos \nresultados gracias a la integraci\u00f3n de la Med icina China y la Medicina Occidental para hacer frente al COVID -\n19.  Una de estas noticias m\u00e1s recientes expone las declaraciones de Yu Yanhong, portavoz del Ministerio de \nSanidad Chino y tambi\u00e9n subdirector de la Administraci\u00f3n Nacional de Tradicional Med icina china, indicando  \nque el m\u00e9todo puede mejorar r\u00e1pidamente la condici\u00f3n de los pacientes con s\u00edntomas leves, como fiebre, tos, \ndolor de garganta, debilidad y falta de apetito , tambi\u00e9n puede ayudar a reducir la duraci\u00f3n de la  estancia  en \nel hospital. Lo s expertos chinos se\u00f1alan buenos resultados de la combinaci\u00f3n de medicina china y occidental \npara el coronavirus  y encuentran que la com binaci\u00f3n puede ayudar a prevenir el desarrollo de s\u00edntomas leves \nen condiciones graves y cr\u00edticas, lo que reduce la tasa  de mortalidad de la enfermedad . Desde el brote de \nCovid -19, las autoridades centrales chinas han destacado en muchas ocasiones la aplicaci\u00f3n de la medicina \ntradicional china combinada con la medicina occidental en el tratamiento de pacientes. Seg\u00fan la \nAdm inistraci\u00f3n Nacional de T MTC , los equipos de expertos m\u00e9dicos en 31 regiones a nivel provincial incluyen \nespecialistas en MTC,  y la mayor\u00eda de las regiones han realizado esquemas de tratamiento de TCM localizados \npara la enfermedad  (https://www.infosalus.com/ ). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           4 \n INVESTIGACI\u00d3N Y EVIDENCIA CIENT\u00cdFICA  \n \nARTICULOS  \n \n1.

Common presentations of confirmed cases include fever, fatigue, dry cough, \nupper airway congestion, sputum production, shortness of breath, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, \nprolonged prothrombin time, elevated C -react ive protein, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. The reported \nsevere/critical case ratio is approximately 7 \u201310% and median time to intensive care admission is 9.5 \u201310.5 days \nwith mortality of around 1 \u20132% varied geographically. Similar to outbreaks of other newly identified virus, there \nis no proven regimen from conventional medicine and most reports managed the patients with \nlopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta -interferon, glucocorticoid and supportive treatment with remdesivir \nundergoing clinical trial. In China, Chinese medicine is proposed as a treatment option by national and \nprovincial guidelines with substantial utili - zation. We reviewed the latest national and provincial clinical \nguidelines, retrospective co - hort studies, and case series regarding th e treatment of COVID -19 by add -on \nChinese medicine. We have also reviewed the clinical evidence generated from SARS and H1N1 management \nwith hypothesized mechanisms and latest in silico findings to identify candidate Chinese medicines for the \nconsideration  of possible trials and management. Given the paucity of strongly evidence -based regimens, the \navailable data suggest that Chinese medicine could be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic option in the \nmanagement of COVID -19. \n \n \n \n2.

Chen and Lori Hsu from three references \nto inform the readers how COVID -19, the 2019 novel coronavirus, is currently treated in China. For readers \nwho may have such an infection, contact and consult your primary physician, go to the hospital or the CDC \nimmediately. For additional information, please contact the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center of \nDisease Control (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  \n \nWith Wuhan on Lockdown for More Than 10 days, the Ch inese Government Announces a Major Change in \nStrategy: All Patients with Confirmed Infections are to Use Chinese medicine.   2/10/2020  \nThe Medical Treatment Unit of Wuhan\u2019s  Nove l Coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) , currently named COVID -19, \nPrevention and Control Headquarters issued a \"Notice Regarding the Agreement to Recommend the Use of \nChinese Medicine in the Treatment of Pneumonia due to Infection from the Novel Coronavirus\u201d. The \u201cNoti ce\u201d \nemphasizes that all designated medical institutions in Wuhan will ensure that all infected patients take Chinese \nmedicine (Chinese medicine decoction or granules) before midnight (24:00) on February 3, 2020.  \nA collaboration between Western and Chinese medicine is undoubtedly  welcoming  news, especially now as \nthe results from the front lines in Wuhan have been very promising.  See below for more.  \n1/29/20  The second dispatch of support from the central government to the Hubei Chinese Medicine \nTreatment tea m took over the newly created isolation ward for pneumonia patients infected by the 2019 -\nnCoV in the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine. It is the only \nmedical facility in the Hubei Province that is managed ent irely under the supervision of the China\u2019s Traditional \nChinese Medicine (TCM), TCM system, providing a central point responsible for determining diagnosis and \ntreatment.   \nThe following is reported in the patient wards under the responsibility of Guandong P rovincial TCM Hospital:   \nPatient Rounds:  The severity of patient conditions was unexpected, and the entire ward was more or less quiet \nas these patients were so weak, that it seemed that they did not even have the energy to moan. Most of the \npatients treat ed were urgently, critically, or severely ill. Many of them had a high fever, a thick tongue coating, \nslippery and wiry pulses, bowel incontinence, and little to no expression on their faces (perhaps from  extreme \nfatigue?).  \n1/30/20  Herbal formulas were   administered to patients according to the individual\u2019s TCM pattern diagnoses, \nas prescribed by Guandong\u2019s experts.  \n2/1/20  Patient Rounds:  Some patients\u2019 fever have  been  reduced. There were  more patients with low -grade \nfever.   By and large,tongue coatings cha nged from thick and greasy to thin, and patient stools were more \nformed. Furthermore, these patients now had the energy to speak for up to five sentences before the onset \nof mild wheezing. Also, in general, coughing was significantly less compared to befor e. Patients\u2019  self-reports  of \nconditions have  improved quite a bit. Patients can now   sit up and practice the qigong exercise,  Eight Brocade \nin bed and/or meditate.  \nAs of 2/4/20:  Nearly  fifty patients in the ward  have clearly  improved. The effectiveness of Chinese herbal \ntreatments are being actively observed and witnessed in this clinical setting.  \n Caption: For the first time, eight patients treated with traditional Chinese medicine or a combination of \ntraditional Chinese and western medicine were discharge d from hospital.  \n1/28/20, Dr. Huang Luqi, the chair of the Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, led the medical team \nof Guang'anmenHospital and Beijing  Xiyuan  Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences to \nsupport Wuhan  Jinyintan  Hospital. Chinese medicine combined with Western medicine, treatment  by \nsyndrome differentiation, greatly improved  the  patients\u2019breathing issues, fatigue, dry mouth, bitterness, \nchest tightness, diarrhea and other symptoms.   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           14 \n 2/3/20,  Eight confirmed patients were discharged from the first ward of the South Building of \nWuhan  Jinyintan  Hospital.  This represents the first group of patients who were discharged from a hospital \nusing traditional Chinese medicine or a combination of traditional Chinese medicine and W estern \nmedicine.  Amongst them, six were female, two were male.   Of these, six were severe and two were mild \ncases.    The age range of the patients was from twenty -six to sixty -eight. After treatment with traditional \nChinese medicine and herbs, most patient s had obviously improved symptoms and an overall improved \nmental state. At the time of discharge, each patient was sent home with a two -week dose of Chinese herbs \nalong with instructions on appropriate exercise and proper diet in order to gain full recover y. \nPlease share this article and the herbal prescriptions with everyone.  \nIn the fight against the pandemic of pneumonia from 2019 -nCoV Novel Coronavirus infection,  Hubei Provincial \nHospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine diligently used the specialties of  TCM, in cooperation with relevant \ndepartments to study and formulate pneumonia prevention and treatment programs  revealing that Chinese \nherbs played a definitive role in positive treatment outcomes.

There has never been \na similar tragedy in China's history, such as the Spanish flu or the Black Death in Europe.   These are examples \nof global plagues that killed tens of millions of people.  \nIn the Chinese history,  whenever a plague is rampant, Chinese medicine practitioners are always on the front \nlines to battle the disease.  Many survived with the help of Chinese Medicine;  so in this fight with the insidious \nand novel Coronavirus, Chinese Medi cine once again  should  take a primary role in effective \ntreatment  and must not be absent in action!  \nReference 1:  https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qzSecLwVXQIfFBTQyHQxHQ  \nReference 2:  https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YajZ_fycSKEoTBvzhOv5Wg  \nReference 3:  https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qSUM5kYJIPJTvKk f_HfuaA?  \n \n \n4.

In 30 different countries, \nthere are over seventy thousand patients have been diagnosed in total. Therefore, it is urgent to develop the  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           19 \n effective program to prevent an d treat for the novel coronavirus pneumonia. In view of Traditional Chinese \nMedicine has accumulated a solid theoretical foundation of plague in ancient and recent decades. Meanwhile, \nTraditional Chinese Medicine can provide the more effective and personal ized treatment via adjusting the \nspecific medicine for each patient based on the different syndromes. In addition, TCM often has different \neffect on the distinct stages of diseases, contributing to the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. \nNowadays, TC M has exhibited decent effect in the in the fight against NCP. Therefore, it is convinced that \nTraditional Chinese Medicine is an effective treatment for 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.  \nIntroduction  \nIn December 2019, an unknown virus pneumonia broke out in Wuhan China. Later the unknown virus was \nidentified as a novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) and the unknown pneumonia named as novel coronavirus \npneumonia (NCP) by Chinese government and scientists [1] . In early February 2020, over sixty thousand \npatients have been diagnosed with NCP in 30 different countries all over the world only after 1 month. And \n99% of the cases have occurred in China. On account of the NCP reported worldwide for the first time, there \nis no specific vaccine and drug. Unfortun ately, the development of novel vaccine or specific drug will take a \nfew months, cannot keeping up with the development of NCP. Therefore, it is urgent to develop the effective \ntreatment for NCP. Though it is no time to discovery effective drugs, the thera peutic effect of NCP is still \nremarkable in hospitals. Partly, this is owing to that Traditional Chinese Medicine  (TCM) is applied in clinic \ntimely as shown in Fig. 1 [2]. After National Health Commission (NHC) of China announcing the emergency \nsituation i n 20 January 2020, the National Admin - istration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (NATCM) rapidly \ndeployed the work, and the first batch of Chinese medicine experts arrived in Wuhan city on the day. In 29 \nJanuary, Na - tional TCM Rescue Team took over Wuhan Jinyintan Hospit - al. Five days later, eight patients \nwere discharged after treat - ment with Chinese medicine, of which six were critically ill. Similarly, the first \npatient diagnosed with NCP in Beijing was discharged after a combination of Chinese and We stern treat - ment. \nAccording to the NATCM, the total effective rate of certain TCM prescription for NCP is over 90% [3]. \nObviously,TCM have been playing a significant role in the combat with NCP.  \nIn fact, TCM played a unique role in the prevention and trea tment of emerging infectious diseases since ancient \ntime. For instance, TCM obtained decent clinical effect on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), H7N9 \n(H7N9 avian in - fluenza) and EVD (Ebola Virus Disease) at one time [4 -6]. In these two thousand ye ars, TCM \nhas laid a solid theoretical foundation in the prevention and treatment of infectious dis - eases via the fight \nagainst diseases. Furthermore, doctors of - ten adjust the specific treatment for each patient or integrate with \nwestern medicine scheme after diagnosing the syn  drome through comprehensive analysis of symptoms and \nsigns. Up to now, TCM has made a big difference in fight against NCP.  \n \n \n \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           20 \n The theoretical foundation of TCM for NCP Though NCP is a novel infectious disease, the similar syndrome  \ninfected by coronavirus are not unfamiliar. Firstly, the history of TCM applied for plague has lasted for over \ntwo thousand years [7](Table. 1). And abundant theories of TCM for explosive infectious disease have formed, \nwhich have sur - vived as treatises up to now. Meanwhile, TCM also play a significant role in the treatment of \nthese coronavirus pneumonias broke out in the last two decades, such as SARS, MERS and H7N9 avian \ninfluenza [4 -6]. Obviously, TCM has accumulated a solid theoretical foundation of p lague and will be an \neffective treatment for NCP.  \n \n \nThe theories of TCM for infectious diseases NCP is infected by the novel coronavirus, but similar infectious \ndiseases are not unacquainted for doctors of TCM. TCM has accumulated a wealth of experience a nd a lot of \nprescriptions, laying a solid theoretical foundation (Table 1). Two thousand years ago (BC 1046), the concept \nof \u201cYi Bing\u201d was proposed. It pointed out that \u201cYi Bing \u201d was different from common cold. \u201cYi Bing\u201d was the \ndisease which has in weste rn medicine among of 112 cases, not including 7 deaths from severe heart and brain \nand other basic diseases [9]. In 2013, H7N9 avian influenza also broke out in China. Then NHC of PRC issued \nthe diagnosis and treatment scheme. In Beijing, the first case wa s also cured additionally by TCM [10].  \nSimilarly, the Chinese Government also issued the diagnosis and treatment scheme of TCM for MERS in 2015 \n[11]. Thus it can be seen that TCM have long history of treatments for coronavirus pneumonia. It is believed \nthat TCM also can be treated for NCP effectively.  \nThe effect of TCM on NCP In the early stages of the outbreak, there is neither standard of western medicine \ntreatment nor targeted drugs owing to the unknown of NCP. However, in these TCM hospital or Integrate d \nChinese and Western Medicine Hospital, TCM has been widely used for the treatment of NCP (Fig. 1). Import - \nantly, the effect of TCM on NCP is prominent. As shown in Fig. 2, \u201cQing Fei Pai Du Tang\u201d (QFPDT) is screened \nout by the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (NATCM) and widely recommended \nnationwide [3].  \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           21 \n  \nFig. 2 The composition of the prescription \u2014Qing Fei Pai Du Tang In total, the prescription contains 21 kinds of Chinese medi - cine, \nwhich mainly derived from 4 different classica l pre - scriptions originated from Shang Han Lun: Ma Xing Shi Gan Tang, Xiao Chai Hu \nTang, She Gan Ma Huang Tang and Wu Ling San.  \n \nThe QFPDT mainly derived from 4 different classical prescrip - tions originated from Shang Han Lun . After \ntreatment of QFPDT, it was reported that the overall response rates were over 90% among of 214 cases in \nclinic (Fig. 1). In addition, doctors of TCM still will diagnose the syndrome through comprehensive analysis of \nsymptoms and signs, then further  adjust the specific treatment for each patient. Therefore, TCM has different \neffect on the distinct stages of NCP. TCM prevents infection for healthy person It is well known that vaccine is \nthe highly effective method to prevent epidemics. Unfortunately, a vaccine will take over half a year from \ndevelopment to approval. Al - though plentiful research institutes have been carrying on the research of \nvaccine for NCP, there is no approved vaccine for clinic at present. However, TCM has rich clinical experience  \nin many diseases including infection, plague, emergency and so on as shown in Table. 1. Abundant Chinese \nmedicinal for - mulae and Chinese patent medicine can effectively prevent healthy person from infection. As a \nnumber of studies have shown [12 -14], TCM  can activate immune cells, improve phagocytosis and induce the \nproduction of cytokines. Ultimately, TCM enhance the immunocompetence of healthy person pre - venting \ninfection. In 2003, TCM was successfully applied to prevent SARS in many areas of China. Th erefore, a lot of \nhospitals and Chinese medical specialist have issued prescrip - tions of TCM for healthy person in defensing \nNCP. TCM improves symptoms for patients with mild symptoms According to the current clinical diagnosis \n[15], patients at an early stage are often with fever, dry cough and fatigue, but part of the patients have \nsuffocating, the existence of lung scattered in the exudation and other symptoms. Luckily, there exists rich \nclinical experience of improving these symptoms in TCM. During the  treatment of NCP, not only these TCM \nhospitals but also those western medical hospitals almost all adopt TCM treatment plan to improve symptoms. \nAs the the quired. On the basis of western medicine, intervention of TCM will control oxygen saturation stable , \nimprove dyspnea and inhibit the release of inflammatory factors. Therefore, Shenmai injection, Shenfu \ninjection and Xuebijing injection were widely used in clinical practice. Seriously, the worsen - ing state will often \nresult in the injury of organs and limited therapeutic effect of symptomatic and supportive treatment. At that \ntime, some TCM therapy can clear the heart and open the orifices, tonify qi and yin, extinguish wind and \nincrease humor. At last, TCM improves immune function to protect organ and correct electrolyte disturbance \nto reduce microcir - culation disturbance and tissue fibrosis. In brief, TCM con - trols the state for critical \npatients via alleviating pulmonary effusion and inhibiting inflammatory overreaction. TCM facilitates the \nrehabili tation process for convalescent patients For NCP, the negative of nucleic acid detection is the key \nindicator of cure. But fatigue, cough, poor mental state and other symptoms are still present [17]. Especially, \nthe changes of patients' lung function and c linical symptoms are not symmetrical and synchronized. In fact, \nthe negative pa - tients are not healthy person, since they have no infectivity but need further recover. Usually, \nconvalescent patients with NCP also have inflammation to be absorbed only afte r the nucleic acid detection \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           22 \n turning negative. In the recovery, con - tinued TCM treatments will reinforce the healthy qi and eliminate the \npathogenic factors. Obviously, TCM improves the patient's symptoms and promotes the complete repair of \ndam - aged orga ns and tissues. Therefore, convalescent patients of - ten continue to take TCM after the nucleic \nacid detection turning negative.  \nTable 2 The representative clinical trials of TCM for NCP  \n \nConclusion  \nThe cure rate of NCP is increasing from 2% in the earl y days to over 20% in these days. And in partial provinces, \nthe cure rate has exceeded 40% [18]. The application of TCM timely and widely is one of these positive actions \nin the fight against this outbreak. In view of the excellent performance of TCM at pr esent, increasing number \nof patients are being treated with TCM additionally. As reported [19], about 88% patients with NCP have been \nreceiving the treatment integ - rated with TCM. Firstly, TCM has accumulated a wealth of experience of \nprevention and treat ment of emerging infec - tious diseases in ancient time and recent decades. Then TCM still \nwill adjust the specific medicine for each patient after diagnosing the syndrome, providing the more effective \nand personalized treatment. In addition, TCM will reduc e ad - verse reactions of western medicine (such as \nantiviral, anti - bacterial drugs and hormones.) via avoiding or decreasing the use of these drugs in clinic. \nTherefore, TCM has special ad - vantage in the combat with NCP. However, there are several defici encies in \nthe development of TCM. As shown in Fig. 1, the national medical team of TCM dispatched to Wuhan timely, \nbut they began to take over the inpatient ward several days later. Because there are no TCM related \ndepartments or sufficient Chinese medicin e in infectious hospital and western medicine hospital. Obvi - ously, \nthe participation rate of TCM in these hospitals is very low. Secondly, the total number of medical staff of TCM \nis seriously inadequate in China. Such as this rescue, the medic - al staff  of TCM accounted for less than 20% in \nthe whole dispatched medical staffs from state and province. More - over, the effect of TCM is not accepted \nconstantly, owing to lack of modern scientific support. Nevertheless, there dozens of TCM for NCP are \nconducti ng clinical trials at present, certain specific Chinese medicines are also incorpor - ated (Tabel. 2). As \nreported [20 -22], several Chinese medicines have exhibited favourable effect. In a word, the development of \nTCM still has long way to go. On all accoun ts, TCM has accumulated a solid theoretical foundation of plague. \nIn the fight against infectious dis - eases broke in recent decades, TCM has played an important role in the \nprevention and treatment. At present, TCM also has been effectively salvaging the patient with NCP. There - \nfore, TCM is and will be an effective treatment for NCP.  \nReferences  \nNational Health Commission of the People \u2019s Republic of China.

The use of \ntraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may have substantial impact on COVID -19. In this review, we summarize \nthe disease pathogenesis, clinical outcomes, and current applications of TCM for the treatment of COVID -19. \nTraditionality  \nThe pathogenesis and clinical symptoms related to severe respiratory disease were described many years ago \nin TCM texts. The ancient book  of TCM Huang Di Nei Jing  (Inner Canon of Huangdi ) was written during the \nWestern Han Dynasty of China (dated approximately 99 B.C.E. -26 B.C.E.); the text recorded a plague that could \ntransmit disease from human -to-human with symptoms that were similar to those described for COVID -19. \nThree additional texts, notably Shang Han Za Bing Lun  (Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases ) written by Zhang \nZhongjing (200 C.E. -210 C.E.), Wen Yi Lun  (Theory of Plague ) and Wen Re Lun  (Translated Theory of Warm ) \nwritten by Wu Yo uke (1642 C.E.), recorded therapies and formulas that were effective at treating infectious \ndiseases; among them, the classical prescription Da Yuan Yin and the use of human variolation were \nconsidered as means to prevent smallpox. Currently, the use of TC M has resulted in remarkable improvement \nand alleviation of symptoms in COVID -19 patients.  \nAbstract  \nSince late December in 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 has received extensive attention for its widespread \nprevalence. A number of clinical workers and r esearchers have made great efforts to understand the \npathogenesis and clinical characteristics and develop effective drugs for treatment. However, no effective \ndrugs with antiviral effects on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been discov ered \ncurrently. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gained abundant experience in the treatment of infectious \ndiseases for thousands of years. In this review, the authors summarized the clinical outcome, pathogensis and \ncurrent application of TCM on cor onavirus disease 2019. Further, we discussed the potential mechanisms and \nthe future research directions of TCM against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.  \nKey words : Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  ; Coronavirus disease 2019  ; Clinical outcome  ; \nAngiotensin -converting enzyme 2  ; Traditional Chinese medicine   \nBackground  \nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) has received extensive attention for its increasing incidence and \nwidespread prevalence [ 1, 2]. On January 31, 2020, World Health Organi zation declared that the outbreak of \nCOVID -19 had become public health emergency of international concern. According to statistics from National \nHealth Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, by February 16, 2020, a total of 70,548 confirmed cases \nand 1,770 fatal cases of COVID -19 had been reported in China. At this writing, cases of COVID -19 infection \nhave been reported in more than 20 countries and in regions worldwide [ 3].  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           25 \n Given the recent advances in research and biotechnology, a virus believed to be the etiologic agent of COVID -\n19 was isolated and the sequence of virus genome was revealed using high -throughput sequencing [ 4]. \nCurrently, this virus is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) [5] and the \ndisease resulting SARS -CoV-2 was officially named COVID -19 by World Health Organization [ 6]. Bats have been \nidentified as the possible animal host of SARS -CoV-2 [7] and a mechanism for SARS -CoV-2 infection has been \npostulated. The timeline of important events marking the SARS -CoV-2 outbreak since the report of the first \ncase on December 26, 2019 is shown in Figure 1 . Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a thousand -year \nhistory of experience with all types of infectious diseases and has been employed previously as effective \ntreatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [ 8]. \nWe report here that TCM is currently in wide use for the treatment of COVID -19. In this review, we summa rize \nthe clinical outcome, pathogenesis and current application of TCM for the treatment of COVID -19. \n \nFigure 1  \nTimeline of important events during SARS -CoV -2 outbreak . COVID -19, coronavirus disease 2019; ACE2, angiotensin -converting \nenzyme 2; SARS -CoV -2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; WHO, World Health Organization; ICTV, International \nCommittee on Taxonomy of Viruses ; NEJM, New England Journal of Medicine; 2019 -nCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus; \u2460, \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908 947.  \nEpidemiology of COVID -19  \nZhou et al. found that the genome sequence of a coronavirus isolated from a bat showed 96% similarity with \nthe sequence of SARS -CoV-2; these results suggested that bat species might be a host of SARS -CoV-2. In \naddition, the earliest cases of COVID -19 were all individuals who reported direct contact with the Huanan \nSeafood Market in Wuhan, China [ 9]. Many wild animals such as hedgehog, badger, snake and birds are sold \nfor human consumption at this market, although bats are not typically included in this group. Researchers \nfrom South China Agricultural University declared the intermediate host of S ARS-CoV-2 could be the Chinese \npangolin ( Manis pentadactyla ) although this has not been confirmed at this date.  \nAn article published on New England Journal of Medicine  on January 29, 2020, reported human -to-human \ntransmission of SARS -CoV-2 [10]. Recent epidemiology studies by Guan et al. [ 11] documented that only a few \nCOVID -19 patients (1.18%) were in contact with wildlife, while 31.8% of COVID -19 patients traveled to Wuhan \nrecently and 71.80% of COVID -19 patients had recent contact with people from Wuhan.  \nRespiratory and  contact transmission are the main transmission routes of SARS -CoV-2. SARS -CoV-2 RNA is also \ndetected in feces of COVID -19 patients, suggesting the possibility of fecal -oral transmission as another \npotential transmission route [ 12-14]. Aerosol and transplacental transmiss ion routes are also regarded as \namong important possibilities to consider, although there is no substantial research supporting this hypothesis \nat this time.  \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           26 \n Clinical symptoms of COVID -19  \nThe asymptomatic incubation period of SARS -CoV-2 is 0 to 24 days, w ith a median incubation period of 3 days \n[11]. Once the disease has taken hold, most of the patients report symptoms including fever, cough, dyspnea, \nmuscle soreness and/or fatigue. Some patients also reported sputum production, headache, hemoptysis \nand/or diarrhea. Patients with mild symptoms develop low -grade fevers and mild fatigue but no symptoms \nsuggestive of pneumonia. By co ntrast, patients with severe disease experience dyspnea and hypoxemia which \ncan develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, severe metabolic acidosis and \ncoagulation disorders [ 9-11, 15]. The epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS -\nCoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) and SARS -CoV-2 and clinical features of three \ndifferent coro navirus syndromes (SARS, MERS and COVID -19) are listed in Table 1  and Table 2 , respectively.  \n \n \n \nThe statistical characteristics associated with SARS -CoV-2 were derived from the 1099 pat ients (as of January \n29, 2020) reported by the team of Zhong Nanshan. The number of confirmed cases and deaths was determined \nby the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (information presented as reported \nthrough February 16, 2020).  \n(?) a, presents the result of current hypotheses but without strong evidence at this time; SARS -CoV, severe \nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; MERS -CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; COVID -\n19, coronavirus disease 2019; SARS -CoV-2, sev ere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.  \n \nAngiotensin -converting enzyme 2: the receptor for SARS -CoV-2 on target cells  \nDuring the pandemic phases of SARS -CoV in 2003, angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as \nthe SARS -CoV receptor on target host cells [ 21]. DNA sequencing revea led that SARS -CoV-2 genome shares \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           27 \n 89% similarity with that of SARS -CoV, suggesting that the mechanisms for SARS -CoV-2 infection of target cells \nmay be similar to that already identified for SARS -CoV [ 9, 22, 23]. Zhou et al. [ 9] demonstrated that ACE2 was \nthe cell entry receptor for SARS -CoV-2 in in vitro infectivity studies. Specifically, Hela cells that were genetically \nmodified to express ACE2 from different species including human, Chinese horseshoe bats, civets, pigs and \nmice were infected with SARS -CoV-2 in vitro. The results demonstra ted that ACE2 proteins from all species \ntested except mice could serve as entry receptors for SARS -CoV-2. Results from experiments using Hela cells \nexpressing human ACE2, or other known coronavirus receptors, including aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl \npepti dase 4, revealed that only ACE2 was effective as an entry receptor for SARS -CoV-2 in vitro.  \nACE2 is a type I transmembrane protein composed of 805 amino acids and is primarily expressed in the \ngastrointestinal tract, heart, kidney and lung. As a negative r egulator of the renin -angiotensin system, ACE2 \nplays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of cardiovascular system and regulating absorption of \namino acids in kidney and gastrointestinal tract [ 24]. Genetic studies also reveal the role of ACE2 in preventing \nstroke [ 25]. \nCoronavirus invasion of host cells depends on the actions of the spike protein (S protein) on virus surface. The \nSARS -CoV S protein includes 2 subunits [ 26]. The receptor binding domain (RBD) on the S1 subunit interacts \nwith ACE2 to form a virion -ACE2 complex. The virion -ACE2 complex is then transported and enters the \nendosome of target cells. Subsequently, the structure domain of h eptad repeats (HR)1 and HR2 in S proteins \ninteract with one another to form a six -helix bundle core. This core promotes fusion of the viral envelope with \ncellular membrane. The RNAs of virus are then released into the cytoplasm of target cells ( Figure 2 ) [27, 28]. \nSARS -CoV virions may also enter the target cell via plasma membrane fusion, via a means similar to that used \nby human immunodeficienc y virus [ 29]. \n \nFigure 2  \nSARS -CoV binds to ACE2 and enters target cell through endosomal membrane fusion.  \u2460 The receptor \nbinding domain (RBD) on S1 protein may bind with ACE2 on cell membrane to form virion -ACE2 complex. \u2461 \nThe virion -ACE2 complex is transported and enters the endosome of target cells. \u2462 The structure domain of \nheptad repeat (HR) 1 and HR2 in S protein interact with one ano ther to form a six -helix bundle core, which \npromotes fusion between the viral envelope and the cellular membrane. The virus RNAs are then released \ninto the cytoplasm of target cells.  \nACE2, angiotensin -converting enzyme 2; S protein, spike protein; RBD, rec eptor binding domain; SARS -CoV, \nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; HR, heptad repeat; 6 -HB, six -helix bundle.  \nAfter entering the target cells, the SARS -CoV RNA genome interacts in a complex with the viral RNA replicase \nand transcription enzymes . The minus strands of viral RNA are transcribed and are ultimately translated into \nstructural proteins [ 30]. The cytoplasmic viral RNAs  and structural proteins are packaged to form new viruses \nwhich are released from infected cells and go on to infect other available target cells in the immediate \nenvironment.  \nIn vivo studies were also carried out to investigate the role of ACE2 in a respi ratory disease model. \nACE2 gene -deleted mice exhibited severe lung injury and dysfunction of renin -angiotensin system in \na model of lung injury induced by cationic polyamidoamine dendrimer nanoparticles; likewise, \ntreatment with an angiotensin II type I re ceptor antagonist suppressed the sequelae of nanoparticle -\ninduced lung injury in wild -type mice [ 31]. Creation of an in vivo infection model for SARS -CoV and \nSARS -CoV-2 was not straightforward, as neither interacts with mouse ACE2. Per lman and colleagues \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           28 \n established a human ACE2 transgenic mice model. With this transgenic mouse model, SARS -CoV \ncould be detected in the pulmonary alveoli. It is conceivable that the human ACE2 transgenic mouse \nmodel can be an important tool for conducting SARS -CoV-2 infection experiments and for identifying \nnew drugs that would be effective for the treatment of COVID -19 [32, 33]. \nRole of TCM on treating COVID -19  \nIn TCM, the term \u201cplague\u201d is used to denote infectious disease. From the earliest times, the Chinese \npeople hav e understood the severity underlying this disease process and have searched for improved \nunderstanding. The ancient book of TCM Huang Di Nei Jing (Inner Canon of Huangdi ) was written \nduring Western Han Dynasty in China (approximately 99 B.C.E. -26 B.C.E.) a nd recorded that plague, \nwith symptoms familiar to modern times, could be transmitted from human -to-human. Shang Han \nZa Bing Lun  (Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases ) written by Zhang Zhongjing (200 C.E. -210 C.E.), Wen \nYi Lun ( Theory of Plague ) and Wen Re Lu n (Theory of Warm ) written by Wu Youke (1642 C.E.) \nrecorded therapies and formulae used to treat plague, including Da Yuan Yin and the use of human \nvariolation to prevent smallpox [ 34, 35]. Dr. Tu Yoyo credited the discovery of artemisinin for the \ntreatment of malaria acc ording to the early records of Zhou Hou Fang  (Handbook of Prescriptions for \nEmergencies ) written by Ge Hong (284 C.E. -364 C.E.) [ 36]. TC M has provided significant and important \ntherapies for SARS -CoV, influenza A H1N1, influenza A H7N9 and Ebola virus [ 37-40]. Consequently, \nTCM is becoming an important means for developing therapies to treat COVID -19. \nPathogenesis of COVID -19 in TCM theory  \nAncient Chinese people believed that man is an integral part of nature. According to this theory, \nenvironmental factors are critical elements in the pathogenesis of plague. For example, TCM \nconsiders that the charact eristics of COVID -19 may largely depend on the environment in Wuhan. \nDuring the winter of 2019, a large amount of precipitation fell in Wuhan, which resulted in a moist \nenvironment and increased the risk of virus infection. This observation implies that a Chinese herb \nthat promotes the elimination of dampness (a kind of pathological product of disease in TCM theory) \ncan be used in the treatment of COVID -19. \nTCM treatments for COVID -19  \nClassical prescription.  The fifth edition of \u201cStandard Therapy of COVID -19\u201d (abbreviated Standard Therapy) \npublished on February 9, 2020, recommended that a modification of the integrated Ma Xin Gan Shi decoction \nwith Da Yuan Yin could be used to improve the chest distress, cough and asthmatic symptoms that develop in \nCOVID -19 [12]. The Ma Xin Gan Shi decoction that includes Mahuang ( Ephedrae herba ), Xingren ( Armeniacae \nsemen amarum ), Gancao ( Glycyrrhizae radi x et rhizoma ), Shigao ( Gypsum fibrosum ) together with Da Yuan Yin \nhad significant impact on SARS in 2003 [ 41, 42]. The use of Da Yuan Yin, composed of Binlang ( Arecae semen ), \nHoupo ( Magnoliae officinalis cortex ), Caoguo ( Tsaoko fructus ), Zhimu ( Anemarrhenae rhizoma ), Shaoyao \n(Dioscoreae rhizoma ), Huangqin ( Scutellariae radix ), Gancao ( Glycyrrhizae raadix et rhizoma ), was first \nrecorded in Wen Yi Lun  (Theory of Plague ) (1642 C.E.); this decoction has been used to treat plague for \nthousands of years. The effectiveness of this decoction for the treatment of SARS was evaluated using a \nmolecular docking method; quercetin, kaempferol, 7 -methoxy -2-methyl isoflavone, formononetin and \nbaicalein were identified as the five compounds with highest connectivity t o the SARS -CoV 3CL protease [ 43]. \nA report dated February 6, 2020 from the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine recommen ded \nthe use of Qing Fei Pai Du decoction that includes Mahuang ( Ephedrae herba ), Shigao ( Gypsum fibrosum ), \nBanxia ( Pinelliae rhizoma ), Zhishi ( Aurantii fructus immaturus ), Shengjiang ( Zingiberis rhizoma recens ), that \nwas derived from a modification of the integration of Ma Xing Gan Shi, She Gan Ma Huang, Xiao Chai Hu, and \nWu Ling San decoctions in Shang Han Za Bing Lun (Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases ) (200 C.E. -210 C.E.); this  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           29 \n recommendation was based on previous experience with SARS and the cold and wet weather in Wuhan. The \nQing Fei Pai Du decoction has been demonstrated to be 90% effective in treating COVID -19 [44]. \nChinese patent medicine.  According to the standard therapy, the patent medicine of Huo Xiang Zheng Qi \ncapsule can be used to treat the gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID -19. Huo Xiang Zheng Qi capsule, derived \nfrom Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang  (Prescriptions Peo ple\u2019s Welfare Pharmacy ) written by Chen Shiwen and \nothers (1151 C.E.), has the effects of resolving dampness and is used to treat diarrhea associated with virus \ninfection [ 45]. The usage of Huo Xiang Zheng Qi capsule for COVID -19 was closely related to the cold and wet \nweather in Wuhan. Likewise, Lian Hua Qin g Wen capsules and Fang Feng Tong Sheng pills can be used to treat \nfever, fatigue and cough associated with COVID -19 [12]. Lian Hua Qing  Wen capsule has broad -spectrum \nantiviral and antibacterial effects, most notably used for respiratory virus infections including influenza, SARS \nand MERS [ 46]. According to a recent retrospective analysis, use of Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule might reduce \nfever, cough, expectoration, fatigue and difficulty with breathing in COVID -19 patients. Among the findings, \nthe fraction of severe cases w as decreased after the treatment of Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule [ 47, 48]. \nOther treatments.  Other therapies associated with TCM such as acupuncture, moxibustion, and Tai Chi \npromote health by enhancing the immune system and improving pulmonary function. Although there is no  \ncurrent evidence relating any of these therapies with COVID -19, they may have crucial roles in disease \nprevention and likewise in promoting recovery of pulmonary function during recuperation from COVID -19. \nAcupuncture has been shown to relieve the side -effects of hormonal therapy and to alleviate pulmonary injury \n[49]. Ben Cao Gang Mu  (Materia Medica with Commentaries ) written by Li Shizh en (1578 C.E.) recorded that \nmoxibustion could improve digestion, relieve asthma and prevent plague; modern studies reveal that \nmoxibustion can limit the acute inflammatory response in respiratory tract [ 50]. Tai Chi is a traditional sport \nin TCM and can enhance recovery of pulmonary function through respiratory training [ 51]. In addition, Jin Zhi \n(Gold Juice), first recorded in Ben Cao Qiu Zhen  (Truth -Seeking Herbal Foundation ) written by Huang Gongxiu \n(1769 C.E.), was made from the fermentation of feces from young men. D uring the Qing dynasty, Jin Zhi was \nused to reduce fever in patients with plague [ 52]. \nSummary and future perspectives  \nSince the emergence of COVID -19, clinicians and researchers have made great efforts to understand the \npathogenesis and clinical characteristics of this infection and to develop effective drugs for its treatment. \nCurrently, there are no effective antiviral available to treat SARS -CoV-2. On February 6, 2020, a clinical trial of \nremdesivir, a newly -discovered antiviral drug with potential impact on SARS -CoV-2, was initiated in Wuhan. \nHowever, given issues related to both safety and efficacy, it will take some time to develop both antiviral drugs \nand a vaccine to prevent SARS -CoV-2 infection. Western -type antiviral therapies including \u03b1-interferon and \nlopinavir, treatment with antibiotics, and support therapies including oxygen and mechanical ventilation have \nbeen used as the treatment of COVID -19. Therapies based on principles of TCM have improved symptoms and \nenhanced immunity against virus in COVID -19 patients. Positive responses from patients have been noted \nwhen efforts are made to combine approaches from TC M and Western medicine on COVID -19. In the future, \nTCM may also have a role in decreasing the some of the side -effects of Western medicine, notably with respect \nto recovery of pulmonary function. Finally, we would like to note that many herbs used in these  decoctions, \nincluding Mahuang  (Ephedrae herba), Xingren (Armeniacae semen amarum),  and Chaihu ( Bupleuri radix ) have \na bitter taste. Many of the bitter contents of these herbs such as ephedrine and amygdalin are aromatic \nsubstances; the hydrophobic propert ies of these aromatic substances may inhibit the interaction of the virus \nS protein with ACE2. However, due to the complex targets and multiple contents that are characteristics of \nTCM decoctions, further studies would be needed to elucidate the detailed m echanisms involved in their \nimpact on COVID -19 using network pharmacology analysis, experimental validation and multi -omics.  \nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.  \nReferences   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           30 \n [1.]  Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, et al.

DOI: 10.4103/wjtcm.wjtcm_12_20  \n \nAdvantages of anti -inflammatory acupuncture in treating sepsis of no vel coronavirus \npneumonia  \nGuan -Yuan Jin1, Louis Lei Jin1, Jin Zheng1, Belinda Jie He2 \nAbstract  \nBackground:  Sepsis is one of the most serious complications and a leading cause of death in patients with \nnovel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). In general, it is the \nresult of an unregulated inflammatory cascade such as a  postinfection \u201ccytokine storm.\u201d The conventional \ntreatment mainly relies on glucocorticoids, of which curative effects are not ideal, as they come with \nsignificant side effects. It is critical to seek or develop other effective therapeutics in dealing cyt okine storm \nto fight NCP with sepsis. Aims and Objectives: Raise awareness of the significance applying anti -inflammatory \nacupuncture in dealing NCP patients with sepsis and provide an appropriate acupuncture protocol that can be  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           33 \n easily integrated into exi sting medical guideline.  Materials and Methods:  Current evidences from animal \nexperiments and clinical trials about acupuncture in treating infectious sepsis are reviewed, and a detailed \ndiscussion on advantages of anti -inflammatory acupuncture is followed , then the rationality on the point \nselection and stimulation parameters of acupuncture is analyzed to propose an appropriate acupuncture \nprotocol.  Results:  Current experiments have shown that acupuncture can play a significant role to improve \ninflammation  reaction and reduce mortality in infectious animal and patients with sepsis and its mechanisms \nare mainly achieved by stimulating the vagus -cholinergic anti -inflammatory pathways. Applying acupuncture \nin treating NCP patients with sepsis has four aspects of advantages. Moreover, a simple and convenient clinical \nacupuncture protocol including point selection and appropriate stimulation parameters is \nproposed.  Conclusion:  Acupuncture, especially electroacupuncture, has shown potentials in effectively \ntreatin g infectious sepsis of animal models and critically ill patients in small sample studies by stimulating the \nnervous system, but has been largely overlooked in the clinic so far. It is advised that acupuncture should be \nintegrated into the existing medical guidelines in dealing with NCP complicated with sepsis.  \nKeywords:  Acupuncture, anti -inflammation, coronavirus disease -19, electroacupuncture, novel coronavirus \npneumonia, sepsis, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  \nIntroduction  \nAs we know, sepsis is defined as a life -threatening organ dysfunction caused by an unregulated host response \nto infection. To date, it affects more than 30 million people annually worldwide and is one of the major causes \nof death for terminally ill patients. Any infec ted person can potentially develop sepsis, and the incidence rate \nis as high as 1% \u20132% of all hospitalized patients.[1] Sepsis is also one of the main complications and causes of \ndeath in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus \n2),[2] which is also referred as coronavirus disease 2019. A cytokine storm o r unregulated inflammatory \ncascade following a viral infection is the main cause of sepsis. When it occurs, it is of the utmost importance \nfor the NCP patient to control the spread of inflammation and prevent the development of cytokine storm as \nsoon as po ssible.  \n \nIn the treatment of sepsis due to cytokine storm, the conventional therapeutics mainly rely on corticosteroids \n(glucocorticoids). In most animal studies, corticosteroid administration consistently protected against lethal \nsepsis. In contrast, however, clinical trials in sepsis found much less consistency in survival benefits from \ncorticosteroids, though most trials demonstrated faster resolution in shock and organ dysfunction.[3] On the \nother hand, the side effects of excessive use of glucocorticoids are significant. Therefore, for sepsis, other \nreasonable therapies have been looking for or combining with. In fact, there is also a promising, simple, and \nno sid e effect treatment method, that is, anti -inflammatory acupuncture mediated by reflective central \ninhibition of the innate immune system,[4] which has been overlooked in the existi ng medical guidelines so \nfar.[2],[5] \nFollowing a review of recent experimental and clinical evidence a nd the mechanisms of anti -inflammatory \nacupuncture in treating sepsis, the authors will delve into the advantages of applying acupuncture in treating \nthe sepsis of NCP patients. A set of acupuncture protocols including point selection and proper stimulatio n \nparameters based on previous methods applying in animal studies and clinical trials, combining with the \nauthors' expertise, is proposed herewith. It is advised that acupuncture should be integrated with the existing \ntherapeutics of both conventional medi cine and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), in order to help reduce \nthe incidence of NCP or sepsis, reduce the mortality rate, and speed up the healing process.  \n \nScientific evidences of anti -inflammatory acupuncture for sepsis  \nMost researchers agree that the degree of inflammatory response heavily impacts the outcome of sepsis, and \nthe elevated level of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -\u03b1 or interleukin (IL) -6 level is related to the rise of  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           34 \n mortality in sepsis patients. A decreased 28 -day mortality r ate could be found following with decreased \nconcentrations of TNF -\u03b1 and IL -6 in blood after treatment. So far, there are many laboratory and clinical \nevidences that show acupuncture or electroacupuncture (EA) may inhibit macrophage activation and the \nprodu ction of TNF, IL -1 beta, IL -6, IL-18, and other pro -inflammatory cytokines via the stimulation of the vagus \nnerve.[4] \n \nIn 2014, Torres -Rosas  et al . reported that when EA was appli ed to mice with sepsis, cytokines that help limit \ninflammation were stimulated as predicted. The results found that half of those mice survived for at least a \nweek, whereas none of those mice that did not receive acupuncture survived. That discovery presen ted a \npotential novel approach to use acupuncture for sepsis in humans. They observed that EA at the Zusanli (ST36) \nof the mice reduced the lipopolysaccharide -induced serum levels of all cytokines analyzed, including TNF, \nmonocyte chemotactic protein -1 (MC P1), IL -6, and interferon -\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). These results indicated that EA had an \ninhibition effect and not just merely delayed the production of cytokines. It is also found that the surgical \nremoval of the sciatic nerve (not the common peroneal or tibial nerve)  can reduce the anti -inflammatory \npotential of EA. This suggested that both the common peroneal and the tibial nerves contribute to the anti -\ninflammatory potential of EA by activating the sciatic nerve and demonstrated for the first time ever the ability \nof the sciatic nerve to control systemic inflammation in sepsis.[6] \n \nOther researchers have also observed that EA at Zusanli (ST36) and Guanyuan (CV4) of mice (5 \u20138 mm and 3 \u2013\n5 mm de pth respectively, then retain the needle for 30 min with continuous wave of 3 Hz, once every 12 h for \na total of 3 times) could increase the synthesis and release of vasoactive intestinal peptide in hypophysis and \nperipheral blood of sepsis rats, and inhib it thymocyte apoptosis through neuro -immune \nregulation.[7] Furthermore, EA at Zusanli (ST36), Tianshu (ST25), Shangjuxu (ST37), and Xiajuxu (ST39) could \nsignificantly improve the level of CD 14+/HLA -DR (human leukocyte antigen DR) and immunosuppression in \npatients with sepsis by EA (continuous wave, frequency 4 Hz, 60 min/time, 2 times/day for 3 days).[8] CD 14+/HLA \n\u2212 DR is the antigen expression on the surface of monocyte/macrophage and its decrease is closely related to \nthe degree of immunosuppression in sepsis.  \nIn 2015, there  were also small sample clinical trials of acupuncture for sepsis in China. A total of ninety patients \nwith sepsis were randomly divided into a control group, thymosin \u03b11 group, and acupuncture treatment \ngroup, thirty cases in each group. The control group  received routine treatment according to the guiding \nprinciple of survival activities of sepsis. Thymosin \u03b11 group was injected subcutaneously once a day for 6 days. \nIn the acupuncture treatment group, Zusanli (ST36), Yanglingquan (GB34), Neiguan (PC6), Gu anyuan (CV4), \nand other associated acupoints were needled (e.g., needling in the morning, twirling and toning for about 20 \u2013\n30 s, keeping the needle for 30 min, during which three times of needling were conducted, each time for about \n20 s), once a day for 6  days. T cell subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+/CD8+) and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, \nand IgM) were detected. The hospitalization time, readmission rate, and 28 -day mortality rate of the three \ngroups were compared. The results showed that after 6 days of treatment, the T cell subsets and Igs were \nsignificantly increased in the three groups ( P < 0.01). The levels of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, IgG, IgA, and IgM in \nthymosin \u03b11 group and acupuncture group were significantly higher ( P < 0.01). Compared with the control \ngroup, the length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) of thymosin \u03b11 group and acupuncture treatment group \nwas significantly shorter, and the readmission rate and 28 -day mortality rate were lower ( P < 0.05,  P < 0.01). \nThere was no significant difference between thymosin \u03b11 group and acupuncture group.[9] In addition, other \nresearchers observed that EA at Zusanli (ST36) and Guanyuan (CV4) of seps is patients, with the vertical depth \nof 5\u201310 mm and 5 \u20137 mm inserted, respectively, could not only reduce the inflammatory reaction of sepsis, \nbut also shorten the length of stay in the ICU when reducing the level of blood lactate.[10] \nAs for the main mechanism of acupuncture or EA in the treatment of sepsis, it has been almost clear that it is \nachieved by strengthening the vagus -cholinergic anti -inflammatory pathways to weaken the cytokine \nstorm.  [Figure 1]  shows two anti -inflammatory pathways[11] activated by acupuncture (EA) in Hegu (LI4) or  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           35 \n Zusanli (ST36) in the treatment of sepsis. The first pathway is the vagus -spleen -cholinergic pathway, in which \nthe efferent signal of vagus nerve is propagated to the celiac ganglia and the superior mesenteric ganglion in \nthe celiac plexus, where the splenic nerve originates. Norepinephrine (NE) released from the splenic nerve \ninteracts with \u03b22-adrenergic receptors ( \u03b22) and causes the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from T cells \ncontaining functional c holine acetyltransferase (T cells). ACh interacts with \u03b17nAChRs on macrophages and \nsuppresses pro -inflammatory cytokine release and inflammation. The anti -inflammatory effect of EA at Hegu \n(LI4) is through this way.  \n  \n  \nFigure 1: Two vagus -cholinergic anti -inflammatory pathways stimulated by acupuncture at Hegu LI4 or Zusanli \nST36(Illustrated by Debbie Maizels, Springer Nature, for Pavlov and Tracey[11]  \nThe second pathway is vagus -adrenal medulla -dopamine pathway, that is, EA at Zusanli (ST 36) activates sciatic \nnerve signals, which by unknown mechanisms convert to efferent vagus nerve signaling to the adrenal medulla \n(which is usually dominated by sympathetic nerve, now known to also have the distribution of the vagus \nnerve), resulting in do pamine release. Dopamine suppresses inflammation and improves survival in a model \nof sepsis.[6] \nIn addition to the effects on the sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, acupunc ture can activate the \nhypothalamic \u2013pituitary \u2013adrenal (HPA) axis governing the systemic release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal \nglands that has an anti -inflammatory role. A typical example of its role is that acupuncture on Huantiao (GB30) \ninhibits comp lete Freund's adjuvant -induced paw edema in mice through a mechanism that is prevented by \nadrenalectomy and glucocorticoid inhibitors. HPA axis stimulation can be a successful strategy to induce the \nproduction and systemic distribution of glucocorticoids t o modulate metabolic and immune responses.[12] \nAnalyzing benefits of using acupuncture to treat sepsis of novel coronavirus pneumonia  \nAccording to the preliminary clinical observation, most of the terminally ill patients with NCP showed \nsignificant increase of pro -inflammatory cytokines, such as IL -6, TNF -a, and IFN -\u03b3, with the characteristics of \ncytokine storm.[13] Integrating acupuncture to treat NCP complicated with sepsis has the following four \nadvantages.  \nFirst, acupuncture therapy is suitable for all stages of the NCP patients. For mild cases, it can strengthen the \nimmunity of the bod y and reduce the risk of deterioration. For severe cases, it can also alleviate the disease \nas much as possible through the rapid neural and bidirectional regulation of the immune function.  \nThe early stage of sepsis is generally thought to be caused by an unregulated production of pro -inflammatory \nmediators forming a cytokine storm, that numerous cytokines such as TNF -\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IFN -\u03b1, IFN -\u03b2, IFN -\n\u03b3, MCP -1, and IL -8 are rapidly produced in body fluids after the body is infected. This stage is characterized by \na hyperactivity of the immune system. With the progress of the pathological course, the body exhibits a \nprocess of compensatory anti -inflammatory response by releasing a large amount of inflammatory \nsuppressing cytokines. In this stage, im munosuppression is being dominated, which is often the key to \ndetermine the prognosis of sepsis patients.[14] Therefore, the production or release of pro -inflammatory \ncytokines s hould be controlled or limited as soon as possible in the early stage of sepsis, and the \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           36 \n immunosuppression should be relieved or reduced as soon as possible in the later stage of sepsis.  \nAcupuncture therapy has the characteristics of bidirectional regulati on of immune function. No matter to \ncontrol the cytokine storm in the early stage of sepsis or to improve the immunosuppression in the late stage \nof sepsis, acupuncture shall play an important regulatory role. Moreover, the regulatory direction of \nacupunct ure depends on the functional state before acupuncture, that is, if the production or release of \ncytokines is excessive, the acupuncture stimulation may weaken the cytokine storm, and if the \nimmunosuppression has occurred, the acupuncture stimulation may d ecrease the immunosuppression. When \napplying acupuncture in the treatment of sepsis, those side effects of glucocorticoids would not occur.  \nAnimal studies have shown that acupuncture can regulate the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone \n(ACTH) and cort icosteroids bidirectionally: increase when it was originally low and decrease when it was \noriginally high. Other studies have observed that ACTH level in the blood of healthy people increased rapidly \nafter acupuncture, reaching 1.5 \u20132 times of that before t he treatment, and peaking at 2 \u20135 min. The \nconcentration of cortisol in the blood increased to 1.5 \u20132 times (15%) of that before the treatment.[15] \nAfter 20 min of acupuncture at H egu (LI4) and Zusanli (ST36), the level of corticosteroids in the blood of healthy \npeople increased significantly and had a longer lasting effect. In patients with appendicitis receiving \nacupuncture, 17 -ketosterol and corticosterone (CORT) were increased i n 24 -h urine, which indicates the \nincrease of ACTH after acupuncture. In animal experiments, after EA, the content of ACTH in the blood was \nmeasured directly, and there was also a significant increase. If the levels of ACTH and corticosteroids had \nincrease d before acupuncture, acupuncture could reduce them.  \nIn 2017, when studying the effects of acupoint association on the related hormones of HPA axis in insomnia \nrats, Wu  et al . observed that the levels of corticotropin -releasing hormone (CRH) in hypothalamus and ACTH \nand CORT in serum were significantly higher in the insomnia group. After acupuncture with three different \nacupoint associations (Baihui + Shenmen, Baihui + Sanyinjiao, and Baihui (GV20) + nonacupoint group), the \nlevels of CRH, ACTH, a nd CORT of them decreased to some extent, compared with the model group.[16] \nIn several of these animal studies, sepsis was associated with a significant early increase in ACTH l evels, which \nreturned to baseline around 72 h. The clinical studies have found that the ACTH level of critical patients was \nsignificantly lower than that of the control group, especially in septic shock.[3] From this, the effect of \nacupuncture on sepsis seemed related to the bidirectional regulation of ACTH.  \nSecond, the anti -inflammatory or the regulating immunity actions of acupuncture are achieved by stimulating \nthe nervous syste m. The neural regulation by acupuncture has a rapid and accurate feature, although not lasts \nlong, which has great potential significance in preventing and treating NCP patients, especially in rescuing \nsevere cases complicated with sepsis.  \nLet us take the acute stress reaction (e.g., fight or flight) as an example to follow the timeline: in response to \nacute stress, the body's sympathetic nervous system is activated. The sympathetic excitation stimulates the \nadrenal glands triggering the release of catechol amines, which include adrenaline and noradrenalin (NE). This \nresults in an increase in heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and breathing rate. After the threat is over, it takes \nbetween 20 and 60 min for the body to return to its prearousal levels. If the thr eat is real and the \u201cfight\u201d is \nunavoidable, the HPA axis is activated after the first surge of adrenaline subsides. The release of cortisol by \nthe adrenal cortex starts later takes place within 20 \u201330 s and thus last longer. Once the danger has passed, \nthe production of cortisol will cease too and consequently the balance between the sympathetic and \nparasympathetic nervous systems is attained.[17] The elevated endogenous cortisol s ecretion is generally more \nsuitable for the sake of activating body's anti -inflammation action, as it does not have potential side effects \nbrought on by supplementing exogenous glucocorticoids.  \nAlthough it is known that stress can suppress the immune syste m through the action of adrenaline and cortisol, \nresearches have shown that the HPA axis can actually have a positive effect on the immune system, reversing \nthe effects of cortisol and increasing the killing ability of natural killer cells. ACTH, part of t he HPA axis \nresponse, has an opposite effect to that of cortisol. These results may be of great significance in the treatment  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           37 \n of diseases related to excessive or persistent inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases, as well as in treating \nNCP.  \nTime is of t he essence for terminally ill patients with sepsis. Once acupuncture effectively stimulates \nsympathetic nervous system (especially postganglionic fiber), or vagal cholinergic anti -inflammatory \npathways, it is possible to quickly calm the cytokine storm and  rescue some patients from deathbeds. As for \nthe short duration of action from each acupuncture session, it can be improved by shortening the treatment \ninterval by increasing treatment frequency from daily to even several sessions per day.  \n \nThird, acupuncture therapy not only has the effect of regulating immune function or anti -inflammatory role, \nbut also has a beneficial effect on other system functions of the body.[18] For example, the lung is the first \ntarget organ damaged by sepsis, which is often manifested as acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome. Needling the bilateral Zusanli (ST36) of rats (directly inserted the needle at the depth of 7 mm), \nfollowed by a pulse current of (3 V, 2 m, 3 Hz) for 12 min, 8 h for 1 time, for 2 days, reduced the inflammatory \nreaction and the acute lung injury of rats with sepsis after being scalded.[19] In another study, acupuncture \nreduced the acute lung injury of sepsis patients by regulating the balance of pro -inflammatory and anti -\ninflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the inflammatory reaction: Needling Zusanli (ST36) and Cheze (LU5), \nfollowin g Deqi (acquire Qi with movement of needle), EA was added with disperse and dense wave, \ncontinuously stimulating for 30 min, 1 time a day for 5 days, which improved the oxygenation index of sepsis \npatients, reduced the APACHE II score and TNF -\u03b1 in patients ' serum and alveolar lavage fluid, and increased \nthe concentration of IL -12.[20] \nAnother example is that the gastrointestinal tract is often the initial organ of sepsis. In the p rocess of sepsis \nonset, the free radicals released by inflammatory cytokines first destroy the gastrointestinal function, and then \nthe gastrointestinal mucosa is swollen and eroded, the permeability is increased, and the intestinal bacteria \nare displaced, thus inducing systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction \nsyndrome. Therefore, regulating gastrointestinal function should be the focus of early treatment of sepsis. \nReported by Yu  et al ., needling bilateral Zusanli  (ST36), Zhongwan (CV12), Tianshu (ST25), Neiguan (PC6), \nShangjuxu (ST37), and Qihai (CV6) at (30 min/time, once a day for 5 days) could effectively improve \ngastrointestinal symptoms, reduce gastric retention and intra -abdominal pressure, improve serum mot ilin \nlevel, and reduce gastrin level in elderly patients with severe sepsis.[21] \nReported by Wu  et al ., on the basis of routine treatment, acupuncture was used to stimulate Zusan li (ST36), \nTianshu (ST25), Shangjuxu (ST37), and Xiajuxu (ST39) in patients with sepsis. After Deqi, EA was applied \n(continuous wave, 4 Hz, 60 min each time, twice a day for 3 days). It improved the intestinal permeability of \npatients with sepsis, restored  the intestinal function as soon as possible, and achieved the target 20 \u201325 Kcal/kg \nper day feeding in the early stage of the patients with critical illness.[22] In 2009, Hu  et al. observed that EA (a \nconstant voltage, 2 \u2013100 Hz, 2 mA for 0.5 h) at Zusanli (ST36) significantly lowered the elevated levels of pro -\ninflammatory factors in the small intestine and alleviate tissue edema and mucosal dysfunction in rats of sepsis \ncaused by  cecal ligation and puncture. It was apparent that these were resulted from the activation of vagus -\ncholinergic anti -inflammatory pathways.[23] \nAcupuncture treatment can alleviat e some serious life -threatening symptoms, such as for patients in shock, \nlow blood pressure can be improved by enhancing microcirculation; for bleeding coagulation imbalance, \nacupuncture can also play a regulatory role. As for the treatment of mild cases o f NCP, it is more effective. \nTherefore, when NCP patients are treated with various conventional or TCM therapeutics, the authors highly \nrecommend that acupuncture should be utilized first and foremost.  \nFourth, acupuncture seemed to have a faster stimulatio n effect on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) than \nmoxibustion. Although moxibustion also has the effect of regulating immune function,[24] its effects are not \nthe same as that of acupuncture. In a pilot controlled clinical trial,[25] it was observed that acupuncture and \nmoxibustion at bilateral Zusanli (ST36) and Guanyuan (CV4) had different effects on  fatigue by regulating ANS.  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           38 \n Acupuncture was more effective in instantaneous changes of HR variability that reflects the activity of vagus \nnerve and moxibustion in long -term aspects. Both acupuncture and moxibustion improved fatigue in chronic \nfatigue syndr ome (CFS) patients, but moxibustion was more effective. The possible mechanism of the \nintervention may be through the activation of the vagus nerve and the conclusion drawn was that moxibustion \nwas deemed more effective than acupuncture in the long -term tr eatment of CFS.  \nFrom the view of needling sensations, the pain stemmed from a stronger needle stimulation can be easily \nrecognized as a kind of stressor by the body, thus stimulating the sympathetic nerve and the HPA axis. \nPreviously, we have discussed the  characteristics of quick stress response. In addition, the local microtrauma \nvia needling can also induce the anti -inflammatory effect of the body, which cannot be achieved by general \nmoxibustion (unless blistering moxibustion or purulent moxibustion is a pplied). Therefore, in authors' opinion, \nmoxibustion is more suitable for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases or to prevent NCP. However, \nfor severe cases, such as concurrent sepsis, acupuncture intervention may generate faster results than \nmoxi bustion, which, of course, needs to be evaluated further to reach a proper conclusion.  \nOf course, as acupuncture is a procedure involving sharp needles penetrating the skin, worries in its usage for \nsuch highly contagious and infectious disease such as NCP  are reasonable indeed. However, be rest assured \nthat this can be resolved as long as the cleaning needling technique is strictly adhered by the practitioner \nduring the needle operation, while also being trained in self -protection techniques, such as manip ulating the \nneedles with gloves. Wearing gloves to perform acupuncture may be a bit inconvenient to the practitioner, \nespecially when begin to manipulate the needles. but it is worth in the long -run when compared with the \npossible therapeutic effects from acupuncture. As for whether other external treatments (such as massage, \ncupping, or scraping) can be alternatives of acupuncture in the treatment of sepsis, more comparative studies \nare needed. At the moment, the anti -inflammatory role of acupuncture is ac hieved by manual needling or EA \nat acupoints. Similar effects may also be achieved by transcutaneous electrical stimulation or implantation of \nelectrodes near the vagus nerve trunk  in vivo . Although the vagus -stimulating action of acupuncture is not as \nprecise and repeatable as implantable electrode stimulation, it is still more simple and feasible, with no need \nto worry about excessive stimulation.  \nAnti -inflammatory acupoint selection and appropriate stimulation parameters  \nBased on the prior clinical studies for sepsis when combining our own expertise, we hereby propose a set of \nacupuncture protocols (selection of acupoints and stimulation parameters) for preventing and treating NCP \npatients complicated with sepsis. These protocols are easy to  operate and convenient for clinical application. \nIt is suggested to use them in conjunction with existing integrative therapeutics.  \nPoint selection and needling methods  \nAny single one or combinations of the following three groups of main acupoints can be selected to treat NCP \nwith sepsis:  \n1. Bilateral Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37) (or nearby tender/reflex points)  \n2. Bilateral Hegu (LI4), Shousanli (LI10) (or nearby tender/reflex points).  \nFor the above acupoints, the filiform needle should be directly inserted  into the muscle beneath the acupoints, \nand it is optimal to  Deqi  (attaining the feeling of soreness, distension, heaviness, numbness, or the sensation \nof \u201clike fish swallowing bait\u201d beneath the needle).  \nIn case that it is difficult to  Deqi , simply retain the needle for 30 min. Every 5 min, perform \u201cneedle -awakening \nmanipulation\u201d (slightly twist the needle) to enhance the stimulation for up to a 1 min.  \n3. Bilateral ear reflex points/tender points inside the concha (such as the lung/heart points in the cavum \nconcha and the kidney/small intestine points in the cymba concha).  \nFirst, detect the tender points either by simple pressure or measurement of low electrical conductance. Use a \nslightly thick filiform needle (0.25 \u20130.3 mm in diameter) to penetrate the ear poi nt (such as lung point to heart  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           39 \n point) to the subcutaneous area of the reflex area. It is optimal to have sharp pain immediately (such as no \npain, the needle should be pulled out and pricked again). Retain the needle for 30 min. After the removal of \nneedle , the needling spot can slightly bleed (about 10 drops is proper) or without bleeding.  \nOther associate points: add Tianshu (ST25), Qihai (CV6) for symptoms of the intestines; add ChiZe (LU5), \nNeiguan (PC6) for symptoms of the lung, etc.  \nElectrical stimulat ion parameters  \nFor patients without contraindications of electrical stimulation, EA should be used as much as possible to \nensure sustained stimulation for a certain period with sufficient stimulation input. Low frequency (3 \u20134 Hz), \ncontinuous wave or disper se-dense wave, suitable (medium) intensity, at least 30 min each time is \nrecommended.  \nWhen applying the above acupuncture protocol, sufficient treatment frequency should be ensured, preferably \n2\u20134 times per day, which can be adjusted according to the patie nt's condition and sensitivity as well as \nresponse to acupuncture. Although needling sensations are not necessary for acupuncture efficacy, it is more \nappropriate for critical or acute patients to perceive needling sense as a sign of therapeutic informatio n of \nacupuncture being inputted into the body.  \nSupporting evidence for the protocol  \n \nIn the treatment of NCP with sepsis, because the local anti -inflammatory effect of acupuncture is not required, \ndistal acupoints can be chosen. The above -mentioned three sets of main points in the protocol are located in \nthe upper limbs, lower limbs, and auricle, respectively. When those points are stimulated simultaneously, that \nis referred as a type of point -association method through different affe rent pathways:[26] The point association \nof ear reflex points innervated by cranial nerves with the limb acupoints innervated by spinal nerves, or the \npoint association of Hegu ( LI4), Sousanli (LI10) on the upper limb with Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37) on the \nlower limbs innervated by different spinal nerves.  \nAlthough the stimulation of vagus nerve used in previous experiments is often realized by stimulating vagus \nefferent ner ve or certain limb acupoints innervated by spinal nerve, in fact, the auricular branch of the vagus \nnerve distributed on the auricle (concha area) as the afferent nerve can also be another target of vagus \nstimulation. It has been confirmed that stimulation  of the concha area can activate the vagus nerve. In 2019, \nAddorisio M et al . observed that the use of vibration to stimulate the external ear could inhibit the production \nof TNF, IL -1 \u03b2, and IL -6 in healthy people and improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis \npatients.[27] Therefore, acupuncture at the ear reflex points found at the concha area is deemed a simple and \neasy method to stimulate cholinergic anti -infla mmatory pathways.[28] \nThere are also evidences that acupuncture at Hegu (LI4) or Sousanli (LI10) of the hand can stimulate the \nexcitation of vagus nerve.[11],[29] The effect of EA at Zusanli (ST36) on sepsis by stimulating cholinergic anti -\ninflammatory pathways through sciatic nerve has also been confirmed in animal experiments.[6] Combined use \nof Shangjuxu (ST37) with Zusanli (ST36) has showed an improvement of immunosuppression and \ngastrointestinal fu nction in severe cases.[8],[21],[22] \nAs for the relationship between the degree of needling sensations and perceived acupuncture effects, the \nexperience of classical acupuncture for thousands of years is that \u201cThe arrival of Qi (referred as Deqi) equates \nto be effective.\u201d It has been thought that intense acupuncture can raise sympathetic tone, whereas weak \nacupuncture can cause parasympathetic excitation. Accordingly, from the view of stimulating sympathetic \nnerve and activating the HPA axis, it should be that the stronger the acupuncture stim ulation is, the better the \neffects. However, from the anti -inflammatory view of stimulating vagus nerve, the requirements for \nacupuncture sensations or Deqi are not quite that high. In a recent study, Uchida  et al . studied the effect of \nneedling sensations  on transient HR slowing and ANS function during needling. It was observed that in 32  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           40 \n healthy men with deep acupuncture, needling on their hands at Sousanli (LI10) (15 \u201320 mm), even without \nneedling sensations, could significantly reduce their HR. Moreover,  regardless of the level of Deqi or perceived \npain during needling, their autonomic nerves are still transferred o parasympathetic advantage.[29] This study \nprovides further supp ort for the selection of limb acupoints and stimulation parameters in the above \nacupuncture protocol that can stimulate cholinergic anti -inflammatory pathways.  \nAs for the benefits of combined electrical stimulation in support of anti -inflammation, some stu dies have \nshown that both manual acupuncture and EA can have a significant impact on leukocytes and their related \ncytokines. However, in subjects with collagen -induced arthritis and inflammation, EA was more effective than \nmanual acupuncture in reducing pr o-inflammatory cytokines such as IL -6, IFN -\u03b3, and TNF -\u03b1.[30] \nThe reason why low -frequency electrical stimulation should be selected is that its anti -inflammatory action is \ndifferent from that of high -frequency electrical stimulation. It was found that the sympathetic nerve \nstimulation induces both local and systemic catecholamine secretion, depending on the selected frequency of \nelectrical stimulation. A high -frequency EA ca n activate the preganglionic nerve that innervates the adrenal \nmedulla to induce systemic catecholamine secretion, whereas a low -frequency EA seemed to activate the \npostganglionic sympathetic nerve to induce local release of NE,[31] so it can achieve a better inflammatory \ninhibition action.  \nAs a clinical reference, the above acupuncture protocol is designed to enhance the vagus -cholinergic anti -\ninflammatory pathways when dealing w ith NCP complicated with sepsis. Actually, aiming at different purpose \nof prevention and treatments (prevention -based or life -saving centric), there are myriad types of acupuncture \nor moxibustion protocols. For example, for patients with mild -to-moderate s ymptoms and/or in recovery \nperiod, moxibustion could be selected. For severe patients with sepsis or in shock, acupuncture with an intense \nstimulation at the extremities or the governor/DU meridian (central reflex area) may be critical to stimulate \nthe sym pathetic \u2013adrenal system and HPA axis to save life. Although the effectiveness of these protocols \nremains to be verified via large sample and high -quality clinical trials, it is clear that acupuncture and \nmoxibustion can bidirectionally regulate the immune system with little or no side effects. This is especially \ntrue when applying acupuncture including EA to treat infectious sepsis by an enhanced stimulation to the \nnervous system.  \nFinally, we would like to emphasize that even though it is common knowledge t hat the body's inflammatory \nresponse to the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms is one of the wisdoms of the body, many people are \nprobably not familiar with another related wisdom of the body, that is, neuronal networks to control excessive \ninflammation  and infectious disorders.[6] Both laboratory and clinical evidence have recently shown that there \nis a negative feedback loop between the ANS and the innate immunity. Electrical stimulation of the vagus \nnerve inhibits the activation of macrophages and the production of various pro -inflammatory \ncytokines.[4] Acupuncture, as one of the most convenient and e ffective natural protocols of TCM, is the best \nchoice to stimulate the neural networks, with little or no side effects. As NCP is now running rampant around \nthe globe, why not give anti -inflammatory acupuncture a chance?  \n \nFinancial support and sponsorship  \nNil. \nConflicts of interest  \nThere are no conflicts of interest.  \nReferences  \n1.

Lihong Liu. Appropriate D, Approaches T. by liu lihong. 2020;1 \u20133. classicalchinesemedicine.org  \nReport from the Front Line in Wuhan by liu lihong translated by hein er fruehauf at Hankou Hospital No. 8.  \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           43 \n On the evening of February 21, carrying the mandate of my teachers Lu Chonghan, Yang Haiying and Yang \nZhenhai as well as the expectations of the Tongyou Sanhe community of Chinese medicine practitioners, I \narrived in H ankou together with Dr. Lei Ming. The 3rd member of our coronavirus treatment team, Dr. Zhao \nJiangbin, arrived the next day.  \nDuring the first three days, we underwent intensive training about hospital rules and protective gear In the \nafternoon of February  24, we entered into the clinical section of the hospital. The inviting unit, the Hemorrhoid \nDepartment No. 3 at Hankou Hospital No. 8, had so far received 20+ patients in all stages of COVID -19 \npneumonia. Some of them had been there for almost 2 months, w hile on the shorter end some had been in \ninpatient care for about 3 weeks. Quite a few of them never tested positive for the virus, but all CT images \nrevealed typical signs of coronavirus -based pneumonia.  \nAltogether, we have so far diagnosed and treated mo re than 10 patients with obvious signs of discomfort. The \nothers either didn\u2019t exhibit any symptoms, or they did not wish to be treated with Chinese medicine \nmodalities. According to our own observations and those of other practitioners reporting from the front lines \nof the outbreak, it has become clear that the initial stage of the infection is not at all characterized by typical \npneumonia symptoms such as fever and coughing. Many coronavirus patients cough only little or not at all, \nwhile their X -ray imag es show clear evidence of pathological changes due to COVID -19 pneumonia.  \n\u2022 Dampness (shi): Almost everyone agrees that dampness is at the core of this disease. All of the cases we \nhave encountered so far display a thick, white, sticky tongue coating. Sinc e our arrival in Wuhan, every one of \nus has observed an increase in sticky coating on our own tongues, as well as the onset of incomplete bowel \nmovements.  \n\u2022 Pulse (mai): The biggest common denominator among patients has been the fact that virtually everyon e \nexhibits a slippery pulse in the cun position of the right hand. This phenomenon signifies that turbid damp \nobstructing the Lung is the main characteristic of this epidemic.  \n\u2022 Absence of Phlegm (wutan) or Low Phlegm Production (shaotan): Typical symptomo logy includes either a \ndry cough or no cough. Because on one hand the normal way of phlegm expulsion by coughing is missing and \non the other turbid damp pathogens are obstructing the middle burner, the resultant blockage of normal \ntransformative pathways c auses turbid phlegm to congeal into a rubbery and glue -like material that severely \ninterferes with proper airway function and has no way out. This is the most important reason for the lingering \n\u201cstalemate\u201d quality of the disease, as well as the tendency to  take a sudden turn for the worse.  \n\u2022 Complexity Syndrome (hebing) and Dual Affliction (lianggan): According to my own observations, from the \nvery beginning of the epidemic all the way until now at the front line, as well as the opinions shared by my \nChines e medicine colleagues working in Wuhan, the etiology of COVID -19 pneumonia is very much a \nmanifestation of Zhang Zhongjing\u2019s classical theory of syndrome complexity and dual pathogenesis. In other \nwords, one can confidently say that this particular epidemi c from beginning to end bears the characteristics \nof what is called Complexity Syndrome and Dual Affliction in the Shanghan zabing lun (Treatise on Disorders \nCaused by Cold and Miscellaneous Disorders). None of the cases we encountered manifested with simp le \nTaiyang Syndrome in the initial stages of the disease, but they all came down right away with Taiyang Yangming \nCombination Syndrome, or even a situation where all three yang channel systems (taiyang, yangming, \nshaoyang) were involved. Many patients exhi bit signs of dual pathogenesis right from the get -go, by coming \ndown with a rapidly progressing respiratory infection with signs of both taiyang and shaoyang disease. In some \ninstances, the disease lingers at the yangming taiyin dual affliction stage, whil e others suffer from taiyang \nshaoyang dual affliction that is further complicated by yangming taiyin issues. Comparatively speaking, \nshaoyang jueyin dual afflictions are rare. As for the Complexity Syndrome (hebing) variant, which specifically \nrefers to a situation where both the surface and the interior and zang and fu organ systems are involved at \nthe same time, an example would be the simultaneous affliction of the Lung and the Large Intestine. An \nappropriate prescription needs to take all of these aspec ts into consideration. Many of the recently publicized  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           44 \n anti-COVID -19 formulas display this characteristic of complexity. The Cinnamon Method (Guizhi Fa) approach \nsuggested by my Fire Spirit School mentor Dr. Lu Chonghan, furthermore, represents a typical a pproach to \nTaiyang Yangming Complexity Syndrome. Other suggestions, such as Ma Xing Shi Gan Tang (Ephedra, Apricot \nSeed, Gypsum, and Licorice Decoction) and similar remedies, or Mahuang Tang (Ephedra Decoction) plus \nWeijing Tang (Phragmites Decoction) are all examples for approaches to more complex syndromes. For dual \naffliction (lianggan) conditions, moreover, the Aconite Method (Sini Fa) of the Fire Spirit School is also an \nimportant method to consider. Especially in situations where \u201cdampness is pronounc ed and yang is feeble\u201d \n(shisheng yangwei) the inclusion of aconite containing formulas is particularly appropriate. Aconite, of course, \nshould always be used cautiously \u2014proper differential diagnostics is always the most important prerequisite \nfor any presc ription!  \n\u2022 Moisten Dryness and Transform Phlegm, Remove Zang Disease via the Corresponding Fu Organ How is it \npossible to liberate the airways by expelling the sticky, rubbery, glue -like phlegm that is obstructing the lungs \nall the way into the alveoli? Th is question is most relevant for the eventual outcome of the disease process! \nWhy is the typical COVID -19 patient hardly coughing or not coughing at all? I believe that this specific \ncharacteristic of the disease is mostly due to the presence of sticky phl egm, which occupies the available \nairway space. normally required for the generation of a productive cough. From the perspective of Chinese \nmedicine, this phenomenon belongs to the category of dry phlegm (zaotan). This kind of issue requires an \napproach th at involves moisturizing dryness and transforming phlegm (runzao huatan). The herb Dongguaren \n(Benincasa), for instance, from the afore -mentioned remedy Weijing Tang is a representative herb in this \ncategory. Many other seeds possess this type of therapeut ic function, i.e. Gualouren (Trichosanthes seed), \nLaifuzi (Radish seed), Baijiezi (Mustard seed), etc. However, this type of super -sticky phlegm cannot necessarily \nbe completely expelled via the prescription of moisturizing and phlegm transforming herbs. T his is where the \nmaneuver of utilizing the zang -fu relationship of Lung and Large Intestine comes into play, by removing zang \ndisease by way of the associated fu organ; by addressing yin disease via its yang counterpart. This approach \nhas often been used w ithin the versatile arsenal of Chinese medicine modalities. Examples can be found in \nhistorical case studies. Specifically, this means that the seed varietals of phlegm transforming herbs, if used in \nsufficient amounts, can expel residual glue -phlegm from the Lung via the Large Intestine. In the arena of \nacupuncture, the corresponding method would be to needle Taiyuan (LU9) all the way connecting to Yangxi \n(LI5), or Yangxi all the way to Taiyuan.  \nII. The Importance of Acupuncture Therapy  \nOur team began trea ting every single patient with acupuncture starting on our first day in the coronavirus \nsection. Because of the logistics associated with buying and preparing herbs, our patients started imbibing \nherbal decoctions only 3 days later. I remember how I felt s lightly awkward when approaching my first patient \nwith a needle. For one, the protective gear with its plastic eye goggles blurs the vision. Secondly, three layers \nof gloves greatly dull sensitivity in the needling hand. And thirdly, I was worried that the  patient would trust \nme, a doctor who had never treated this kind of disease before. I was therefore completely taken by surprise \nwhen the patient exclaimed: \u201cThis works like a miracle! The stuffy feeling in my chest is completely gone!\u201d \nAnd another patien t said shortly thereafter: \u201cMy throat and chest area used to feel as blocked as a road during \nrush hour \u2014now it has become like an open road without a single soul on it.\u201d  \nThis sort of feedback was a pleasant and unexpected surprise for us, providing us with  hope and strength at \nthe same time. Most of the accompanying symptoms, such as stuffiness in the chest, shortness of breath, \nabdominal discomfort, itchy throat with the urge to cough, dizziness, cold sensation in the upper back, \nconnective tissue pain, sw eating, etc, did either decrease with the acupuncture treatments or resolve entirely.  \nThis experience proved that my earlier suggestion to \u201cuse acupuncture and herbal medicine together\u201d in the \ntreatment of this epidemic was realistic. Perhaps the greatest benefit of acupuncture is the immediate \nimprovement in the emotional outlook of patients, since they get to experience a noticeable improvement in \na short period of time. This aspect cannot be underestimated in the process of curing this disease. Overall,  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           45 \n however, the term \u201ccure\u201d needs to be used with extreme caution in the context of this pneumonia epidemic. \nThis is definitely not the kind of situation where one is all better once the fever has broken, or one is OK once \nthe coughing spells come to an end, or when the virus test turns from positive to negative. There are at least \n3 additional elements that are prerequisites for a complete cure of COVID -19 related issues: 1) The complete \nremission of pneumonia signs on CT images; 2) The normalization of all L ung channel abnormalities; 3) The \ndisappearance of sticky tongue coating. Otherwise, the disease may come roaring back for another round!  \n \n \n14. Ling C quan. Traditional Chinese medicine is a resource for drug discovery against 2019 novel \ncoronavirus (SARS -CoV-2). J Integr Med [Internet]. 2020;18(2):87 \u20138. Available from : \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.joim.2020.02.004  \nJournal of Integrative Medicine journal homepage: www.jcimjournal.com/jim  \nTraditional Chinese medicine is a resource for drug discovery against 2019 nov el coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2) \nNovel coronavirus pneumonia, named as COVID -19 by the World  Health Organization, has spread widely since \nDecember 2019 [1 \u20133], with more than 40,000 confirmed cases in China and exportations to over 20 countries \n[4]. On January 3 0, 2020, the World Health Orga - nization declared the epidemic to be a public health \nemergency of international concern in the second meeting of the Emergency Com - mittee [5]. It was \nrecommended that potential vaccines and antiviral medicines should be dev eloped. However, the \ndevelopment of these therapeutics will take months, even years. For this specific indica - tion, rapid \nperformance of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can contribute as an alternative measure.  \nIn 2003, patients with severe acute resp iratory syndrome (SARS) who were treated with TCM benefited from \nshorter hospitalization, decrease in steroid -related side effects, and improvement of symp - toms [6]. Notably, \ngenomic and in silico structural characterization of novel coronavirus revealed that it is closely related to the \nSARS coronavirus, further suggesting that TCM may have potential use in the current outbreak [7]. Indeed, the \nChina government is advising doctors to consider combining Western antiviral drugs with TCM remedies in \ncombatin g novel coronavirus pneumonia. However, there were few studies to help select suitable herbal drugs \nbefore costly biological experiments and clinical trials.  \nClassically, whether a TCM remedy can be clinically used for viral infections depends on two aspec ts: 1) clinical \nsymptoms and signs of the patient, and 2) the type of TCM remedy and its traditional indi - cations. TCM \nformulas have been used in China over 2000 years. According to their effectiveness, TCM remedies are divided \ninto var - ious types, each corresponding to a group of diseases. On the other hand, research has shown that \nmany TCM remedies have antiviral ingredients. Selecting specific TCM formula through integrative methods \nbased on both disease symptom and pathogen -directed cause will greatly  increase the clinical potential. \nHowever, it is still a challenge to experimentally screen many TCM remedies for the treatment of novel \ncoronavirus pneumonia in a short time.  \nIn this issue of the Journal ofIntegrative Medicine, Zhang et al. [8] provided in silico methods to narrow down \nTCM remedies that may directly inhibit the coronaviral reproduction. Two principals for selection were \nproposed: oral effectiveness to inhibit viral infec - tion and compatibility of patient manifestation. The \nidentified TCM  remedies should contain anti -novel coronavirus chemicals that meet the requirement for orally \nadministered medical drugs. Meanwhile, the identified TCM remedies should be of the types of TCM remedy \nthat have activity against virus -caused pneumonia. To thi s end, the authors conducted a series of in silico \nanalyses. A number of natural compounds were selected, which were experi - mentally validated for their \npotential activity against SARS or Mid - dle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. These chemicals wer e then \nevaluated for their suitability for oral administration. Most importantly, the molecular structures of these \nnatural compounds were evaluated for their ability to interact, or dock, with the main proteins of the novel \ncoronavirus. Positive docking s uggested their ability to inhibit the novel coronavirus infection. In order to com -  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           46 \n ply with patient manifestation, the authors conducted another three rounds of screening. First, TCM herbs \nthat contained at least two of the above natural compounds were se lected from the Traditional Chinese \nMedicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSPT) database [9]. These medicinal plants were classified by the types \nof diseases they are used to treat. Only those belonging to the types that have been classically used to treat \nviral pneumonia were selected for further studies. Next, comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of \nthese TCM herbs was performed. The authors downloaded its documented chemical constituents of each herb \nand analyzed their cellular protein targets for ne twork pharmacological analysis. All these processes found \nthat at least 26 TCM herbs have potential in vivo anti -novel coronavirus effects and can simultaneously \nregulate host inflammation responses.  \nThis work highlights the prospect of computer -aided, structure -based TCM drug discovery for the novel \ncoronavirus pneumonia. These approaches helped to narrow down the large libraries of compounds into a \nsubset in a relatively short time with limited resou rces; they also provided guidance for the future clinical use \nof TCM formulas. Although the potential is great, at the same time, we need to be fully aware of challenges \nand limitations faced by these tools. Computational prediction is a bridge between the ory and experiment, \nand further research is needed. Inhibitory assays and crystallography should be performed to confirm the \ninterac - tion of the herbal compounds with viral proteins and structures. It is worth noting that in a recent \nstudy to identify pot ent ebola - virus inhibitors, only two of the eight compounds selected by in silico screening \nshowed inhibitory properties, reflecting the limited reliability of the computational scoring functions [10]. The \ndecoction of the selected 26 TCM herbs should be tested for their effectiveness and safety in both cell cultures \nand animal models. Eventually, TCM remedies should be evaluated in carefully tal research and clinical use of \nthese remedies, especially in those countries, territories or areas with reported and confirmed cases of COVID -\n19. Although the difficulties and challenges are fully recognized, we are looking forward to increasing the \ncontribution and benefits from TCM professionals that will provide treatment to many patients with \npneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV), a new virus also named as SARS -CoV-2 by the \nInter - national Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.  \nFunding This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81430101).

It is the infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SA RS-CoV-2) and it is a kind of atypical pneumonia. On 1 December 2019, the first \ncase of COVID -19 was confirmed in the city of Wuhan, Hebei province, China and the virus that started the \npneumonia outbreak spreads in the country. The major source of infecti on is the patients with COVID -19 and \nasymptomatic SARS -CoV-2 carriers seem also a potential source of infection. It is mainly transmitted by \nrespiratory droplets, contact, digestive tract and aerosol transmission. This disease is characterized as highly \ncontagious and is susceptible to humans of all ages. On 8 January, 2020, the first case of COVID -19 was \nconfirmed in Thailand, which is the earliest confirmed case outside China [1]. On 20 January, the first \nconfirmed case was identified in the Republic of K orea [2]. Since then, a number of cases were confirmed in \nSingapore, Italy, Iran, the United States, Russia, etc.. Thus far, this disease has spreaded globally.  \nOn 31 January 2020, WHO declared this epidemic outbreak a public health emergency of internatio nal concern \n(PHEIC) [3]. On 2 March 2020, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director -General of WHO, pointed in the \nopening remarks at the media that outside China, a total of 8739 cases of COVID -19 have been reported to \nWHO from 61 countries, with 127 death s [4]. The epidemics in the Republic of Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan are \nof greatest concerns. The fight against COVID -19 gets more serious globally. From 16 to 24, February 2020, 25 \ninternational and Chinese experts of the WHO -China Joint Mission traveled  to Beijing, Hubei, Guangdong and \nSichuan, China to investigate the fight against the epidemic. On the second day after the end of investigation, \nDr. Bruce Aylward, the head of the international expert panel of the WHO -China Joint Mission, the senior \nadvis er to the WHO\u2019s Director -General, stated at the press briefing at WHO Headquarters in Geneva, that \nfaced with the unknown pathogen, China has taken ambitious, flexible and aggressive efforts in responding to \nthe epidemic. In the report, WHO -China Joint Mis sion has confirmed that China has played a crucial role in \nprotecting the international society, buying precious time for countries to adopt active prevention and control \nmeasures and providing them with worthwhile experiences. The report also points out s pecifically the high \neffective role of non -pharmaceutic measures [5]. The report said that China, as the country with the greatest \nknowledge on COVID -19, should further enhance the systematic and real -time sharing of epidemiologic data, \nclinical results an d experience to inform the global response.  \nWith regard to \u201cnon -pharmaceutic measures\u201d proposed in the report of WHO -China Joint Mission, besides \nactive surveillance, timely detection, voluntary quarantine and rigorous tracing, actually, there is still a \nmysterious power, that is various kinds of external therapeutic approaches of traditional Chinese medicine \n(TCM). By the time for the authors submitting the manuscript, it is known that many therapeutic methods of \nTCM, e.g. Chinese herbal decoction, acupunc ture, moxibusiton, acupoint plaster, auricular acupuncture and \ncupping have adopted in the treatment of COVID -19. In the regions where TCM therapeutic methods were \nhighly utilized, the curative rate was increased, the number of severe case decreased and th e hospital \ndischarge rate improved remarkably [6]. The utilization of TCM therapeutic interventions block effectively the \ncontinuous spreading of COVID -19 in China. Note:  \n \nPicture from www.chinanews.com  \nIn application of TCM techniques, e.g. acupuncture and moxibustion in treatment of COVID -19. Main content \nof Guidance Three sections are included in Guidance, named the principle of acupuncture -moxibustion \ninterventions, the methods of acupuncture -moxibust ion interventions, and the self -interventions of \nacupuncture and moxibustion at home under the instruction of physician. Regarding the principle of \nacupuncture -moxibustion interventions, Guidance emphasizes: The rigorous quarantine and disinfection are \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           49 \n required. No matter for the confirmed cases or the convalescent cases, they can be treated in the same room \nrespectively and every suspected one should be isolated in a single room for treatment. During the clinical \ntreatment stage, acupuncture can be combine d with western medications and Chinese herbal decoction to \nachieve the collaborative effect. For the cases at the recovery stage, the core role of acupuncture -moxibustion \nshould be played in the rehabilitation. It is recommended to set up acupuncture -moxib ustion based COVID -\n19 rehabilitation clinic. In reference to the clinical stage identification of TCM suggested in Diagnosis and \ntreatment plan of corona virus disease 2019 (tentative seventh edition) issued by National Health Commission \n(NHC) of the PRC a nd State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SATCM) of the PRC, three stages \nare included in the treatment with acupuncture and moxibustion, e.g. medical observation stage, medical \ntreatment stage and recovery stage.

Additionall y, the combination of these two interventions or \nthe combination with acupoint application, auricular therapy, acupoint injection, scraping therapy, infantile \ntuina or acupoint massage is adopted accordingly. The even needling technique of acupuncture is u sed and \nthe needle is retained for 20 to 30 min at each acupoint. Moxibustion is exerted for 10 to 15 min at each \nacupoint. The treatment is given once daily. The manipulation is implemented in reference to the national \nstandard, GB/T21709 Standardized man ipulations of acupuncture and moxibustion and clinical experiences. \nThe third section of Guidance is the most characteristic: the self -interventions of acupuncture and moxibustion \nat home under the instruction of physician.  \nMoxibustion therapy: Moxibustion  is applied by the patient him/herself at ST36, PC6, LI4, CV6, CV4, SP6, etc., \nabout 10 min at each acupoint.  \nAcupoint application therapy: The plaster, e.g. moxibustion -thermal plaster or moxibustion -like plaster, is \nused at ST36, PC6, CV6, CV4, BL13, BL 12, BL20, GV14, etc.. Tuina therapy at meridian and acupoints: The \ndifferent tuina methods are exerted at the acupoints on the lung meridian and the heart meridian, the \nacupoints located below the knee on the spleen meridian and the acupoints on the stomac h meridians, such \nas finger -pressing method, kneading method, palm pressing method, kneading -pressing method, tapping \nmethod or knocking method. Each manipulation is exerted for 15 to 20 min till the patient feels soreness and \ndistention in the local area.  Traditional physical exercise: The traditional physical exercise is optional according \nto the individual recovery conditions, including Yijinjing (Exercise for muscle and tendon strengthening), \nTaijiquan (Taiji boxing), Baduanjin (Eight -section exercise),  Wuqinxi (Five -animal exercise), etc.. Each physical \nexercise is applied once daily, 15 to 30 min each time. Emotional counseling: The attention is paid to emotional \nregulation. Auricular points, moxibustion, tuina, herbal diet, herbal tea, medicated bath and music are \napplicable in combination for physical and mental relaxation, anxiety relief and sleep assistance.  \nFoot bath and fumigation -washing therapy: the herbs for expelling wind, clearing heat and eliminating \npathogen are selected, i.e. J\u012bngji\u00e8 ( \u8346\u82a5  Herba Schizonepetae), \u00c0iy\u00e8 ( \u827e\u53f6 Folium Artemisiae Argyi), B\u00f2he ( \u8584\n\u8377 Herba Menthae), Y\u00fax\u012bngc\u0103o ( \u9c7c\u8165  \u8349 Herba Houttuyniae), D\u00e0q\u012bngy\u00e8 ( \u5927\u9752\u53f6  Folium Isatidis), P\u00e8il\u00e1n ( \u4f69\u5170 \nHerba Eupatorii), Sh\u00edch\u0101ngp\u00fa ( \u77f3\u83d6\u84b2  Rhizoma Acori Tatarinowii), L\u00e0li\u01ceoc\u01ceo ( \u8fa3\u84fc\u8349  Polygonum lapathifolium  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           51 \n L.), Y\u00f9j\u012bn ( \u90c1\u91d1 Radix Curcumae) and D\u012bngxi\u0101ng ( \u4e01\u9999  Flos Caryophylli), 15 g for each, as well as B\u012bngpi\u00e0n ( \u51b0\u7247\nBorneolum Syntheticum) 3g. The decocted Chinese herbal liquid is poured into a foot tub and an appropriate \namount of warm wate r is added. When the water is ready at 38 to 45 \u2103, foot bath is exerted for around 30 \nmin. All of the interventions above are the dominant techniques of health care in TCM. Their utilization fully \nembodies the idea of \u201cdisease prevention\u201d in TCM, meaning, p reventing from illness before suffering, \npreventing from the progress of illness after suffering and preventing from recurrence after cured. They play \nthe crucial role in reducing the incidence of COVID -19 and preventing from its recurrence. Suggestions It  is \nobserved that the regimens in Guidance recommended are on the base of the ancient literature research, \nmodern clinical research and experimental research of acupuncture and moxibustion and in reference to a \nseries of achievements obtained in the effect  mechanism research of acupuncture and moxibustion in recent \nyears. Firstly, the regimens recommended in Guidance are in agreement to the staging of TCM treatment in \nDiagnosis and treatment plan of corona virus disease 2019 (tentative seventh edition) issu ed by NHC and they \nfocus specially on the characteristics of acupuncture -moxibustion therapies. Secondly, the implementation of \nvarious therapeutic methods is in compliance with \u201cbeing convenient, safe and effective\u201d. Thirdly, Guidance \ndetermines its effor ts for the contribution of acupuncture -moxibustion therapies to each stage of the diseases, \npoints out the combination of acupuncture with western medication and Chinese herbal decoction, plays the \ncoordination effect of acupuncture and moxibustion and bel ieves the crucial effect of acupuncture and \nmoxiustion at the recovery stage of COVID -19.  \nCOVID -19 is the seriously epidemic disease. TCM and acupuncture -moxibustion have not been adopted as the \nfirst option in treatment. Besides the limited understanding in the effectiveness of them, the other key reason \nis for TCM therapy, especially acupunct ure-moxibustion, the physician has to very closely contact with patient \nduring treatment, which highly increases the infectious incidence of medical staffs. Therefore, the protection \nto medical staffs must be in the top priority when exerting acupuncture, moxibustion, seed -pressure of \nauricular acupuncture, cupping, scraping, etc.. The acupuncture physicians who had participated in the \ntreatment of COVID -19 responded that it is very inconvenient to operate acupuncture with three -layer \nprotective gloves. In case the gloves are broken, infection may occur. The authors believe that for moxibustion \ninterventions, the mild moxibustion with hand -holding moxa stick is not suggested. The moxibustion device \nwith the function of smoke abatement or smoke discharge shou ld be optioned to avoid the stimulation of \nmoxa smoke to the respiratory tract of patient. But, such mild moxibustion with hand -holding moxa stick can \nbe applicable for the home nursing care. Regarding the effectiveness of moxa smoke, the consensus has not  \nbeen met yet in academic field. But, in reference to the records of ancient medical works and the nowadays \npopular method of moxibustion in the folk, moxa smoke is applicable for the prevention of infectious diseases. \nFor example, it is recorded in Zh\u014fuh\u00f2 u B\u00e8ij\u00edf\u0101ng \u300a\u8098\u540e\u5907\u6025\u65b9\u300b  (Emergency Formulas to Keep Up One\u2019s \nSleeve), written by Hong GE, in the Jin Dynasty(317 \u5e74\uff0d420AD) that smoking with moxa around the patient\u2019s \nbed, one moxa cone on each side of the bed is optimal to prevent from epidemic infection. The m edical \nmasters in the later generations had inherited this idea. The same prevention method is also recorded in \nT\u00e0ip\u00edng Sh\u00e8nghu\u00ecf\u0101ng ( \u300a\u592a\u5e73\u5723\u60e0\u65b9\u300b  Formulas from Benevolent Sages Compiled during the Taiping Era) \nand P\u016dj\u00ecf\u0101ng ( \u300a\u666e\u6d4e\u65b9\u300b Formulas for Universal Relief ) . This moxibustion intervention is the earliest -\nrecorded measure of air disinfection in history. The modern research discovers that moxa smoke acts on anti -\nbacteria, anti -fungus, anti -virus and anti -pathogen [8]. Therefore, on the base of individual tolera nce, the \nappropriate use of moxa smoke in room brings a certain effect of disinfection. In Guidance, the duration of \nmoxibustion at each acupoint is 10 to 15 min. But, in clinical practice, the moxibustion is seldom exerted on \naucpoints one by one. Instead , the special device, moxa box or moxa holder is used to cover several acupoints \nsimultaneously in one moxibustion intervention. The duration of treatment is over 30 min generally and it will \nbe even longer if the heat -sensitive moxibustion is exerted. The refore, the authors believe that the duration \nof moxibustion intervention should be longer to achieve a better effect if the patient is in a comfortable \nposture and has strong endurance.   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           52 \n  \nNote: Picture from CCTV Compared  \nCompared with Guidance of the firs t edition, the content of Guidance of the second edition is much richer and \nmore practical and instructive. With the development of COVID -19, the people are getting deep understanding \nof the disease and more and more experiences in treatment will be accumu lated gradually. It also reflects that \nthe nature of medical development is the process of constant understanding, rectification and conquering \ndisease. At present, COVID -19 is spreading in many countries of the world. China\u2019s experiences in fight against \nCOVID -19 have been recognized and advocated by WHO. Of them, the application of Chinese herbal \nmedication, acupuncture and moxibustion have their unique characteristics. Undoubtedly, the modern \nmedicine measures give priority to treatment and salvage of CO VID-19. But, no matter which medical theoretic \nsystem is adopted, faced with the epidemic, every measure should aim to treating disease and saving lives. \nMore weapons available in the fight against the disease do bring more benefits to patients.  \nReferences   \n[1] Jiang XM.

KEYWORDSKEYWORDS Chinese medicine, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID -19), \nprevention program, clinical evidence, Chinese medicine, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID -19), prevention \nprogram, clinical evidence, review  \nIn December 2019, a pneumonia associated with the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID -19) emerged in \nWuhan, Hubei Province, China.(1)  \nIt is highly contagious and has quickly spread to many other parts of China and some other countries within 1 \nmonth since the fi rst report emerged. As of February 11, 2020, 44,653 cases of confi rmed infections and \n1,113 deaths have been reported in Chinese mainland.(2) Outside of China, there had been 395 confirmed \ncases and 1 death from 24 countries were reported as of February 11, 2020.(3) The outbreak o f COVID -19 \nraised intense attention not only within China but internationally.(4) On 20 January 2020, the Chinese \ngovernment added it to the Notifiable Communicable Disease List and gave the highest priority to its \nprevention and treatment.(5) On 30 Januar y 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public \nhealth emergency of international concern for China's COVID -19. \nAlthough the WHO said: \"To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the novel \ncoronavirus\",(6) in China , historically, when the outbreak started, Chinese medicine (CM) approaches \nincluding oral administration of preventive herbal formulae, wearing CM sachets, indoor herbal medicine \nfumigation, etc. were recommended for prevention and treatment.(7,8). For ex ample, in 2003, CM approaches \nwere used to prevent and treat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),(9,10) which was the most serious \ninfectious disease outbreak in China prior to the COVID -19. In 2009, during the pandemic of H1N1 infl uenza \naround the w orld, the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China issued a CM  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           54 \n prevention program, which included 4 Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) formulae for adults of different CM \nbody constitutions and one for children.(11)  \nThe current outbreak of COVID -19 resulted in many provinces in China issuing CM prevention and control \nprograms, among which the prevention programs are mainly oral CHM formulae. This study has reviewed the \nhistorical and human research evidence on CM in preventing and control  of infections in order to provide \nguidance for the prevention of COVID -19. \nMETHODS  \nData Sources  \nThree types of data were searched, including historical classics records, human research evidence and current \nprevention programs. ( \u2160) Historical classics records: records on the prevention of epidemic diseases in \nancient CM books were searched, including history, treatment principles, medicines and application of CM to \nprevent epidemic disease. ( \u2161) Human research studies: studies to evaluate the pr eventive effects of CM on \ncontagious respiratory virus diseases were included. The inclusion criteria were as follows. (1) Study design: \nclinical trials, cohort studies, and other population studies without control. (2) Population: high -risk \npopulations ex posed to SARS or H1N1 infl uenza. (3) Intervention: oral CHM formulae, including decoction, \ngranules, or patent medicine. (4) Control: placebo, blank or without control group. (5) Outcome: infection rate \ndefi ned as laboratory -confi rmed incidence of disea se. (\u2162) Current prevention programs: CM prevention \nprograms for COVID -19 issued by the state or provincial health authorities in China. Considering that some \nprovinces had regularly updated the programs according to the local prevalence and clinical practi ce, the most \nrecent versions of the programs were included for analyses in this study.  \nLiterature Search  \nRetrieval strategy differed among the above three types of data. The fi rst type of data was based on mainly \nmanual retrieval of ancient books of CM on  epidemic diseases, supplemented by electronic database retrieval. \nThe list of literature retrieved was determined by discussion among all authors. Secondly, 6 databases were \nsearched including PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, China National K nowledge Infrastructure \n(CNKI), Wanfang Data, and CQVIP database, with the key words of \"severe acute respiratory syndrome\" (or \n\"SARS\"), \"infl uenza\", \"H1N1\", \"prevent*\" and \"Chinese medicine\" (pinyin: zhongyi or zhongyao). Thirdly, \ngovernment websites or offi cial media websites were searched for prevention programs on COVID -19. Two \nauthors (Luo H and Tang QL) conducted the literature search independently. The search date was up to \nFebruary 10, 2020.  \nData Extraction and Analysis  \nThe following data were extracted and analyzed: source of evidence, time of publication or release, author, \nsetting, basis for formulation of CM prevention strategy, composition of CM prescription, target disease, \ncourse of prevention, effect, and adverse reaction. The data was qualitatively described and presented, and if \npossible, quantitative or descriptive statistics were conducted. When the data were available for pooling, \nmeta -analysis would be conducted by RevMan 5.3 software (https:// community.coch rane.org/help/tools -\nand-software/ revman -5/revman -5-download).  \nRESULTS  \nCHM Formula for Preventing \"Pestilence\" in Ancient CM Classics  \nThe theory of prevention and treatment of \"pestilence\" (refers to fatal epidemic disease, pinyin: wenyi) in CM \noriginated from Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing), which was written about 2000 years ago.(12)  \nIt suggested two aspects which should be employed to prevent the spread of epidemics. One was to maintain \nand improve the healthy qi in the body by taking prev entive medicine [Xiaojin Dan ( \u5c0f\u91d1\u4e39 ) in Huangdi's  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           55 \n Internal Classic, the first recommended formula of CM to prevent pestilence], healthy diet care, exercise and \nso on, so as to resist the invasion of external pathogen, and the other was to avoid the source of  infection.(13)  \nThese two principles of epidemic disease prevention have been followed by CM practitioners till now.(12,14)  \nSince Huangdi's Internal Classic, a large number of formulae for preventing epidemic diseases have been \nrecorded in other ancient CM  classics, such as, the Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies (Zhou Hou Bei \nJi Fang), Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold for Emergencies (Bei Ji Qian Jin Yao Fang), Medical \nSecrets of an Official (Wai Tai Mi Yao), Compendium of Materia Medic a (Ben Cao Gang Mu), etc.(15)  \nThe famous doctor SUN Si -miao (541 \u2013682 AD) expounded the basis of medicines to prevent \"pestilence\" in his \nbook Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold for Emergencies: \"pestilence comes from nature, so to \nprevent it, we  need to fi nd medicinal herbs that also come from nature. People would not be infected if they \nknow and take preventive medicine.\"(16)  \nA literature study compared the characteristics of medicinal formulae for preventing pestilence in different \nperiods of ancient China, found that during the Jin and Tang Dynasties (3rd \u201310th century AD), medicinal \nformulae were mainly used to eliminate the pathogenic factors, while Ming and Qing dynasties (14 \u201320th \ncentury AD) focused on fortifying Spleen (Pi), resolving damp ness, clearing heat, and detoxifying.(17)  \nAlthough many formulae for pestilence prevention were recorded in ancient CM books, the case description \nof prevention was relatively rare. Through limited literature searches, we found an interesting case report: SU \nShi (1037 -1101 AD), a famous poet in the Northern Song Dynasty, accidentally found a formula for preventing \npestilence named Sheng San Zi ( \u5723\u6563\u5b50 ), a powder consisting of 22 herbs.(18)  \nLater, when he was demoted to Huangzhou, Hubei Province, the pestilence  had been outbreak for several \nyears. He disclosed the prescription to the local people. After taking this formula, the number of patients with \nthe disease was significantly reduced, and many lives were saved. This story was recorded by SU Shi himself, \nwhe n he wrote a preface to his doctor friend PANG An -shi's book General Treatise on Febrile Diseases (Shang \nHan Zong Bing Lun).(18)  \nEvidence of CHM Formula for Preventing SARS Three studies were identified including 1 controlled study (19) \nand 2 single cohort  studies (20,21) conducted during the epidemic of SARS. Lau, et al (19) designed a controlled \nstudy to evaluate a herbal formula for prevention of SARS (no herbal intervention in the control group) and \nconducted it in Hong Kong SAR, China. The sample size was 16,437 (1,063 in the herbal group and 15,374 in \nthe non -herbal group), and all participants were hospital care workers including doctors, nurses, and other \nstaff. The result showed that none of the participants who took modifi ed formula of Yupingfeng Powder (\u7389 \n\u5c4f\u98ce\u6563 ) plus Sangju Decoction ( \u6851\u83ca\u996e) contracted SARS, while 64 out of 15,347 (0.4%) in the non -herbal \ngroup were infected with SARS (P=0.035). Nineteen cases (1.8%) appeared minor adverse effects after 14 days \ntaking herbal medicine, including diarrh ea, sore throat, dizziness, and nausea.  \nBoth single cohort studies were conducted in Beijing, China with sample sizes of 3,561(21) and 163, \nrespectively. All participants were medical staff from two hospitals, where SARS patients were recruited and \ntreated  during the study period. Among them, Xu, et al's study (20) only included fi rst -line medical staff in \ntreating SARS. The courses of taking herbal formulae for prevention were 6 days (20) and 12 \u201325 days,(21) \nrespectively. The formulae used in these studie s were both classical formula Yupingfeng Powder plus some \nheat -clearing and detoxifying herbs. The results showed that none of the participants who took the preventive \nherbal medicine had contracted SARS in the two studies. Information on the safety of the  herbal medicines \nwas not reported.  \nThe details of the preventive herbal formulae of the three studies are presented in Table 1.  \nEvidence of CHM Formula for Preventing H1N1 Influenza   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           56 \n Four studies were identified, including 3(22 -24) randomized controlled tr ials (RCTs) and 1(25) non -randomized \ncontrolled clinical study. All the studies were conducted during the prevalence of H1N1 influenza in Chinese \nmainland and published in Chinese. In these studies, participants were exposed to high -risk environments, \nsuch  as hospitals and schools where H1N1 influenza occurred. The total sample size was 25,636 with the \nlargest one of 25,329.(25)  \nThe testedherbal interventions included self -made herbal formulae and Chinese patent medicines [Qingjie \nFanggan Granule ( \u6e05\u89e3\u9632\u611f \u9897\u7c92 ), Kangbingdu Oral Liquid ( \u6297\u75c5\u6bd2\u53e3\u670d\u6db2 ); Ganmao Qingre Granule ( \u611f\u5192\u6e05\n\u70ed\u80f6\u56ca )]; while in the control group, 1 study used placebo and 3 used blank control. The course of herbal \nformulae ranged from 3 to 7 days, while the follow -up ranged from 5 to 30 days. The outcome me asure was \ninfection rate of H1N1 infl uenza tested by laboratory serological diagnosis. One study reported that no \nadverse events occurred,(22) while the others did not report. The details of the characteristics of included \ntrials are presented in Table 2.  \nThe data on infection rate of H1N1 influenza from 4 studies were pooled in meta -analysis. The results showed \nthat the infection rate in the herbal formulae group was signifi cantly lower than that in the control group \n[relative risk (RR) 0.36, 95% confi d ence Interval (CI) 0.24 \u20130.52, P<0.01]. A sensitivity analysis was conducted \nto exclude non -RCT and the results showed similar effect (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 \u20130.62, P<0.01, Figure 1).  \nSummary of Officially Issued CM Prevention Recommendations for COVID -19 \nUp t o February 12, 2020, the National Health Commission of China has issued 5 versions of diagnosis and \ntreatment programs for COVID -19, but none have included any content on CM prevention and control, but on \ntreatment since the 3rd versions.(26)  \n \n \nOf the 3 1 provinces (including autonomous regions, and municipalities) in Chinese mainland, health \nauthorities in 23 provinces had offi cially issued programs recommending herbal formulae to preventing \nCOVID -19. These 23 provinces cover 7 regions of mainland: Nort heast, North, Central (including Wuhan, Hubei \nProvince, the original outbreak of COVID -19), South, East, Northwest, and Southwest China. All programs were \nformulated by clinical experts organized by local health authorities according to local geographic an d climate \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           57 \n characteristics and COVID -19 prevalent conditions. The earliest program recommending CM for prevention \nwas issued by Sichuan Province on January 21, 2019. Ten provinces have updated their programs since the fi \nrst announcement, 7 of them have iss ued the 2nd edition and 3 issued the third edition. The applicable \npopulation of preventive programs included general and special population (such as the elderly, children, \npregnant women, patients with chronic comorbidity diseases). Different groups of po pulations had specifi ed \npreventive CM formulae. The programs issued by the 23 provinces included CM formulae ranging from 1 up \nto 10, with an average of 3.4 per program. With regard to the course of CM formulae for prevention, 11 \nprovinces recommended fro m 3 to 14 days, while 12 provinces did not mention. In addition, Tibet Autonomous \nRegion recommended Tibetan medicine and Guizhou province recommended Miao medicine formulae (one \nof the minority folk medicines). The basic characteristics of 23 provincial p rograms are shown in Appendix 1.  \nWe counted the frequency of the herbs used in CM formulae for prevention of general population issued by \nthe 23 provinces. The results showed that these formulae contained 54 different herbs, of which 19 herbs with \na frequency of use for 3 or more times in preventive formulae for general population (Figure 2). The top two \nwere Radix astragali (Huangqi) and Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma (Gancao).  \n \nDISCUSSION  \nAs a new emerging acute respiratory infectious disease, COVID -19 lacks effective methods to control and treat \nthe infection. It is urgent and reasonable to explore effective intervention strategies from traditional medicine \nfor its prevention. This study examines the historical records for infection prevention in CM , as well as previous \nclinical evidence on CM prevention for similar public health emergencies such as SARS and H1N1 influenza. \nRecorded literature showed that the use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases can be traced back \nto ancient CM pract ice over thousands of years, and its successful effects were preliminarily substantiated by \nmodern human clinical researches when applied to SARS and H1N1 influenza epidemics suggesting that \nhistorical CM experience is a worthwhile approach.  \nBased on the comprehensive analyses of the prevention programs issued by 23 provinces since the COVID -19 \noutbreak, we found that the main CM principles in preventing COVID -19 were to tonify qi to protect and \nprovide defense from external pathogens, dispers e wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness with \naroma. It was also similar to the characteristics of CHM formulae for preventing \"pestilence\" in ancient times \nand SARS in 2003.(17,19)  \nThe 6 most commonly used herbs were Astragali Radix (Huangqi), Glyc yrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma (Gancao), \nSaposhnikoviae Radix (Fangfeng), Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos \n(Jinyinhua), and Forsythiae Fructus (Lianqiao). Astragali Radix (Huangqi), Saposhnikoviae Radix (Fangfeng), and \nAtrac tylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (Baizhu) are all ingredients of a classical herbal formula Yupingfeng \nPowder, for tonifying qi to protect from external pathogens. In Lao, et al's controlled study (19) of CM formula \nfor preventing SARS, Yupingfeng Powder was also the main ingredients. Some studies have confirmed that \nYupingfeng Powder has antiviral, anti -inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects.(27,28)  \nJaponicae Flos (Jinyinhua) and Forsythiae Fructus (Lianqiao) are the core components of Yinqiao Powder, \nwhic h is a classical formula used to prevent and treat respiratory infectious diseases in ancient.(29)  \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           58 \n An experimental study found that the effect of Yinqiao Powder ( \u94f6\u7fd8  \u6563) in preventing and treating upper \nrespiratory tract infection could be explained by its a ntibacterial and antiviral properties and improvement of \nthe function of upper respiratory mucosal immune system.(30)  \nA multicenter, large -scale, randomized trial found that Yinqiao Powder plus another heat -clearing formula \ncould reduce time to fever resol ution in patients with the infl uenza virus infection.(29)  \nAt present, the National Health Commission of China has not issued a CM prevention program for COVID -19. \nThe reasons may be, first, according to the CM theory of three -factors concerned treatment ( Sanyin Zhiyi, \u4e09\n\u56e0\u5236\u5b9c ), due to the differences of individual, regional, and seasonal factors in the occurrence and distribution \nof diseases, these factors should be considered in prevention and treatment,(31,32) and second, lack of solid \nevidence of CM formul a for COVID -19. By comparing and analyzing the prevention programs issued by \nprovincial levels, we also found that there was slight regional difference in the recommended herbal formulae \nand prescription principles. For example, due to the dry climate in n orthern China, there are additional one or \ntwo herbs for nourishing yin in the formula, like Glehniae Radix (Shashen) and Ophiopogonis Radix (Maidong), \nwhile in the south, due to the humid climate, aromatic herbs with the function of resolving dampness and  \nturbidity are used in the formulae, like Pogostemonis Herba (Huoxiang) and Eupatorii Herba (Peilan).  \nIndividual difference was also considered in the prevention programs in some provinces. There were two or \nmore formulae recommended in 18 provinces' progr ams, which were applicable for different populations, \nsuch as the elderly, children, pregnant women, or patients with chronic comorbidity diseases, population in \nclose contact with COVID -19 patients, etc. In addition, 7 provinces or province - level municip ality (Beijing, \nTianjin, Shanxi, Henan, Hunan, Shandong, Yunnan) recommended formulae according to the types of CM body \nconstitutions of the population. This tailored prevention strategy might help to improve the preventive effect.  \nWe suggest that the safe ty should also be paid attention to when taking CHM formula to prevent COVID -19, \nespecially when they are used for long period. The public should choose the prescriptions under the guidance \nof CM doctors according to the program issued by provincial health  authorities, and avoid taking the \nprescriptions or herbs with unknown origin and without offi cially approval. It should also be noted that the \nprevention advice for taking decoction were not reported in the 12 provinces' program. According to the \nprogram s of other provinces, it is appropriate to take the decoction for 1 week.  \nBased on the consideration of health economics and balance of risks and benefits, we do not recommend that \nall people should take CHM to prevent COVID -19. Due to the highly contagion ,(33,34) high -risk populations \nexposed to COVID -19 patients, including medical personnel, family members, and other people who are in \nclose contact with COVID -19 patients, as well as residents living in COVID -19 outbreak areas, would probably \nbenefit from taking CHM formulae for prevention. These formulae recommended in the prevention programs \nare easily available in pharmacies and hospitals across the country.  \nAs there is no direct clinical evidence for the prevention of the new emerging COVID -19, current ly reported \nresearches were from previous literature on the prevention of SARS and H1N1 influenza by CM which can only \nbe considered as indirect evidence to refer to the current outbreak. Thirdly, the prevention programs for \npreventing COVID -19 were issued  shortly after the outbreak, which were formulated by CM experts based on \ntheir previous experience in the prevention and treatment of similar diseases and their initial understanding \nof the disease; therefore, the actual effect of these programs needs to be verifi ed in clinical application, and \nupdated and improved according to the evidence of new researches on COVID -19. \nFor future studies, we recommend prospective cohort studies, RCTs or registry studies to evaluate the effect \nof CHM formulae in preventi on of COVID -19. At present, as the COVID -19 has not yet been controlled, we \nexpect that a series of prospective population studies with rigorous design and large sample should commence \nwith protocol registration, ethical approval, and implementation in a t imely manner, to produce reliable \nevidence for CM prevention of COVID -19 or similar emerging respiratory infectious diseases in the future.   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           59 \n In conclusion, based on historical records and clinical evidence of SARS and H1N1 infl uenza prevention, CHM \nformula  could be an alternative approach for the prevention of COVID -19 in high -risk population while waiting \nfor the development of a successful vaccine. Prospective well design population studies are needed to \nevaluate the preventive effect of CM.  \nConflicts of Interest  \nThe authors declare that they have no competing interest.  \nAuthor Contributions  \nLuo H, Tang QL, and Liu JP conceived of the design and carried out the study.

National Health Co mmission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. \nDiagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by new coronavirus (trial version 7). National Health \nCommission, National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 2020.  \nDiag nosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7)  \n(Released by National Health Commission & State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine on March \n3, 2020)  \nSince December 2019, multiple cases of novel coronavirus pneumon ia (NCP) have been identified in Wuhan, \nHubei. With the spread of the epidemic, such cases have also been found in other parts of China and other \ncountries. As an acute respiratory infectious disease, NCP has been included in Class B infectious diseases \nprescribed in the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, \nand managed as an infectious disease of Class A. By taking a series of preventive control and medical treatment \nmeasures, the rise of the epidemic sit uation in China has been contained to a certain extent, and the epidemic \nsituation has eased in most provinces, but the incidence abroad is on the rise. With increased understanding \nof the clinical manifestations and pathology of the disease, and the accum ulation of experience in diagnosis \nand treatment, in order to further strengthen the early diagnosis and early treatment of the disease, improve \nthe cure rate, reduce the mortality rate, avoid nosocomial infection as much as possible and pay attention to \nthe spread caused by the imported cases from overseas, we revised the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for \nNovel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 6) to Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus \nPneumonia (Trial Version 7).  \nI. Etiological Ch aracteristics  \nThe novel coronaviruses belong to the \u03b2 genus. They have envelopes, and the particles are round or oval, often \npolymorphic, with diameter being 60 to 140 nm. Their genetic characteristics are significantly different from  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           62 \n SARS -CoV and MERS -CoV. Current research shows that they share more than 85% homology with bat SARS -\nlike coronaviruses (bat -SL-CoVZC45). When isolated and cultured in vitro, the 2019 -nCoV can be found in \nhuman respiratory epithelial cells in about 96 hours, however it takes abo ut 6 days for the virus to be found if \nisolated and cultured in Vero E6 and Huh -7 cell lines. Most of the know -how about the physical and chemical \nproperties of coronavirus comes from the research on SARS -CoV and MERS -CoV. The virus is sensitive to \nultravi olet and heat. Exposure to 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and lipid solvents such as ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine -\ncontaining disinfectant, peracetic acid, and chloroform can effectively inactivate the virus. Chlorhexidine has \nnot been effective in inactivating the vi rus. \nII. Epidemiological Characteristics  \n1. Source of infection Now, the patients infected by the novel coronavirus are the main source of infection; \nasymptomatic infected people can also be an infectious source. 2. Route of transmission Transmission of th e \nvirus happens mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. There is the possibility of aerosol \ntransmission in a relatively closed environment for a long -time exposure to high concentrations of aerosol. As \nthe novel coronavirus can be isolated in feces and urine, attention should be paid to feces or urine \ncontaminated environmental that leads to aerosol or contact transmission. 3. Susceptible groups People are \ngenerally susceptible.  \nIII. Pathological changes  \nPathological findings from limited a utopsies and biopsy studies are summarized below: 1. Lungs Solid changes \nof varying degrees are present in the lungs. Alveolar damage involves fibromyxoid exudation and hyaline \nmembrane formation. The exudates are composed of monocytes and macrophages, wit h plenty of \nmultinucleated syncytial cells. Type II alveolar epithelial cells are markedly hyperplastic, some of which are \ndesquamated. Viral inclusions are observed in type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. Alveolar \ninterstitium is marked with  vascular congestion and edema, infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes, and \nvascular hyaline thrombi. The lungs are laden with hemorrhagic and necrotic foci, along with evidence of \nhemorrhagic infarction. Organization of alveolar exudates and interstiti al fibrosis are partly present. The \nbronchi are filled with desquamated epithelial cells, mucus and mucus plugs. Hyperventilated alveoli, \ninterrupted alveolar interstitium and cystic formation are occasionally seen. On electron microscopy, \ncytoplasmic NCP virions are observed in the bronchial epithelium and type II alveolar epithelium. NCP virus \nantigen positivity in some alveolar epithelia and macrophages are revealed through immunohistochemistry \nstaining, which are positive for NCP virus nucleic acid via RT-PCR. 2. Spleen, hilar lymph nodes and bone \nmarrow The spleen is evidently shrunk. Lymphocytopenia and focal hemorrhage and necrosis are present. \nMacrophagocyte proliferation and phagocytosis are noted in the spleen. Lymph nodes are found with sparse \nlymphocytes and occasional necrosis. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are present in reduced quantity in the spleen and \nlymph nodes, revealed by immunohistochemistry staining. Pancytopenia is identified in bone marrow. 3. Heart \nand blood vessels Degenerated or necrosed myocardial cells are present, along with mild infiltration of \nmonocytes, lymphocytes and/or neutrophils in the cardiac interstitium. Endothelial desquamation, \nendovasculitis and thrombi are seen in some blood vessels. 4. Liver and gall bladder Appearing en larged and \ndark -red, the liver is found degenerated with focal necrosis infiltrated with neutrophils. The liver sinusoids are \nfound hyperemic. The portal areas are infiltrated with lymphocytes and monocytes and dotted with \nmicrothrombi. The gall bladder is  prominently filled. 5. Kidneys The kidneys are noted with protein exudation \nin the Bowman\u2019s capsule around glomeruli, degeneration and desquamation of the epithelial cells of renal \ntubules, and hyaline casts. Microthrombi and fibrotic foci are found in th e kidney interstitium. 6. Other organs \nCerebral hyperemia and edema are present, with degeneration of some neurons. Necrosis foci are noted in \nthe adrenal glands. Degeneration, necrosis and desquamation of epithelium mucosae at varying degrees are \npresent in the esophageal, stomach and intestine.  \nIV. Clinical Characteristics 1. Clinical manifestations Based on the current epidemiological investigation, the \nincubation period is one to 14 days, mostly three to seven days. Main manifestations include fever, fa tigue  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           63 \n and dry cough. Nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, myalgia and diarrhea are found in a few cases. \nSevere cases mostly developed dyspnea and/or hypoxemia after one week. In severe cases, patients progress \nrapidly to acute respiratory distress s yndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis that is difficult to correct, \ncoagulopathy, multiple organ failure and others. It is worth noting that for severe and critically ill patients, \ntheir fever could be moderate to low, or even barely noticeable. Some c hildren and neonatal cases may have \natypical symptoms, manifested as gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, or only \nmanifested as low spirits and shortness of breath. The patients with mild symptoms did not develop \npneumonia but only low fever and mild fatigue. From current situations, most patients have good prognosis \nand a small number of patients are critically ill. The prognosis for the elderly and patients with chronic \nunderlying diseases is poor. The clinical course of pregnant women  with NCP is similar to that of patients of \nthe same age. Symptoms in children are relatively mild.  \n2. Laboratory tests General findings In the early stages of the disease, peripheral WBC count is normal or \ndecreased and the lymphocyte count decreases. Som e patients see an increase in liver enzymes, lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH), muscle enzymes and myoglobin. Elevated troponin is seen in some critically ill patients \nwhile most patients have elevated C -reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and no rmal \nprocalcitonin. In severe cases, D -dimer increases and peripheral blood lymphocytes progressively decrease. \nSevere and critically ill patients often have elevated inflammatory factors. Pathogenic and serological findings \n(1) Pathogenic findings: Novel coronavirus nucleic acid can be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, \nlower respiratory tract secretions, blood, feces and other specimens using RT -PCR and/or NGS methods. It is \nmore accurate if specimens from lower respiratory tract (sputum or air tra ct extraction) are tested. The \nspecimens should be submitted for testing as soon as possible after collection. (2) Serological findings: NCP \nvirus specific IgM becomes detectable around 3 -5 days after onset; IgG reaches a titration of at least 4 -fold \nincre ase during convalescence compared with the acute phase.  \n3. Chest imaging In  the early stage, imaging shows multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes, \napparent in the outer lateral zone of lungs. As the disease progresses, imaging then shows multiple ground \nglass opacities and infiltration in both lungs. In severe cas es, pulmonary consolidation may occur while pleural \neffusion is rare.  \nV. Case Definitions 1. Suspect cases Considering both the following epidemiological history and clinical \nmanifestations: 1.1 Epidemiological history 1.1.1 History of travel to or residen ce in Wuhan and its surrounding \nareas, or in other communities where cases have been reported within 14 days prior to the onset of the \ndisease; 1.1.2 In contact with novel coronavirus infected people (with positive results for the nucleic acid test) \nwithin  14 days prior to the onset of the disease; 1.1.3 In contact with patients who have fever or respiratory \nsymptoms from Wuhan and its surrounding area, or from communities where confirmed cases have been \nreported within 14 days before the onset of the disea se; or 1.1.4 Clustered cases (2 or more cases with fever \nand/or respiratory symptoms in a small area such families, offices, schools etc within 2 weeks).  \n1.2 Clinical manifestations 1.2.1 Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; 1.2.2 The aforementioned imaging \ncharacteristics of NCP; 1.2.3 Normal or decreased WBC count, normal or decreased lymphocyte count in the \nearly stage of onset. A suspect case has any of the epidemiological history plus any two clinical manifestations \nor or all three clinical manifestation s if there is no clear epidemiological history.  \n2. Confirmed cases Suspect cases with one of the following etiological or serological evidences: 2.1 Real -time \nfluorescent RT -PCR indicates positive for new coronavirus nucleic acid; 2.2 Viral gene sequence i s highly \nhomologous to known new coronaviruses. 2.3 NCP virus specific Ig M and IgG are detectable in serum; NCP \nvirus specific IgG is detectable or reaches a titration of at least 4 -fold increase during convalescence compared \nwith the acute phase.  \nVI. Cli nical Classification  \n1. Mild cases The clinical symptoms were mild, and there was no sign of pneumonia on imaging.   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           64 \n 2. 2. Moderate cases Showing fever and respiratory symptoms with radiological findings of pneumonia.  \n3. 3. Severe cases  \nAdult cases meeting any of the following criteria  \n(1) Respiratory distress ( \u226730 breaths/ min);  \n(2) Oxygen saturation \u226493% at rest;  \n(3) Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/ fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) \u2266 300mmHg (l \nmmHg=0.133kPa).  \nIn high -altitude areas (at an altitu de of over 1,000 meters above the sea level), PaO2/ FiO2 shall be corrected \nby the following formula: PaO2/ FiO2 x[Atmospheric pressure (mmHg)/760] Cases with chest imaging that \nshowed obvious lesion progression within 24 -48 hours >50% shall be managed as severe cases.  \nChild cases meeting any of the following criteria:  \n(1) Tachypnea (RR \u2265 60 breaths/min for infants aged below 2 months; RR \u2265 50 BPM for infants aged 2 -12 \nmonths; RR \u2265 40 BPM for children aged 1 -5 years, and RR \u2265 30 BPM for children above 5 y ears old) independent \nof fever and crying;  \n(2) Oxygen saturation \u2264 92% on finger pulse oximeter taken at rest;  \n(3) Labored breathing (moaning, nasal fluttering, and infrasternal, supraclavicular and intercostal retraction), \ncyanosis, and intermittent apn ea;  \n(4) Lethargy and convulsion;  \n(5) Difficulty feeding and signs of dehydration.  \n4. Critical cases  \nCases meeting any of the following criteria: 4.1 Respiratory failure and requiring mechanical ventilation; 4.2 \nShock; 4.3 With other organ failure that r equires ICU care.  \nVII. Clinical early warning indicators of severe and critical cases  \n1. Adults  \n1.1 The peripheral blood lymphocytes decrease progressively; 1.2 Peripheral blood inflammatory factors, such \nas IL -6 and C -reactive proteins, increase progress ively; 1.3 Lactate increases progressively; 1.4 Lung lesions \ndevelop rapidly in a short period of time.  \n2. Children.  \n2.1 Respiratory rate increased; 2.2 Poor mental reaction and drowsiness; 2.3 Lactate increases progressively; \n2.4 Imaging shows infiltrati on on both sides or multiple lobes, pleural effusion or rapid progress of lesions in \na short period of time; 2.5 Infants under the age of 3 months who have either underlying diseases (congenital \nheart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respiratory tract deformity, abnormal hemoglobin, and severe \nmalnutrition, etc.) or immune deficiency or hypofunction (long -term use of immunosuppressants).  \nVIII. Differential Diagnosis  \n1. The mild manifestations of NCP need to be distinguished from upper respiratory tract infections caused by \nother viruses. 2. NCP is mainly distinguished from other known viral pneumonia and mycoplasma pneumoniae \ninfections such as influenza virus, adenov irus and respiratory syncytial virus. Especially for suspect cases, \nmethods such as rapid antigen detection and multiplex PCR nucleic acid detection should be adopted as much  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           65 \n as possible for detection of common respiratory pathogens. 3. It should also be d istinguished from non -\ninfectious diseases such as vasculitis, dermatomyositis and organizing pneumonia.  \nIX. Case Finding and Reporting Health professionals in medical institutions of all types and at all levels, upon \ndiscovering suspect cases that meet the  definition, should immediately put them in single room for isolation \nand treatment. If the cases are still considered as suspected after consultation made by hospital experts or \nattending physicians, it should be reported directly online within 2 hours; s amples should be collected for new \ncoronavirus nucleic acid testing and suspect cases should be safely transferred to the designated hospitals \nimmediately. People who have been in close contact with patients who have been confirmed of new \ncoronavirus infec tion are advised to perform new coronavirus pathogenic testing in a timely manner, even \nthough common respiratory pathogens are tested positive. If two nucleic acid tests, taken at least 24 -hour \napart, of a NCP suspect case are negative, and the NCP virus specific IgM and IgG are negative after 7 days \nfrom onset, the suspect diagnosis can be ruled out.  \nX. Treatment 1. Treatment venue determined by the severity of the disease 1.1 Suspected and confirmed cases \nshould be isolated and treated at designated hosp itals with effective isolation, protection and prevention \nconditions in place. A suspect case should be treated in isolation in a single room. Confirmed cases can be \ntreated in the same room. 1.2 Critical cases should be admitted to ICU as soon as possible . \n2. General treatment 2.1 Letting patients rest in bed and strengthening support therapy; ensuring sufficient \ncaloric intake for patients; monitoring their water and electrolyte balance to maintain internal environment \nstability; closely monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation. 2.2 According to patients\u2019 conditions, monitoring \nblood routine result, urine routine result, c -reactive protein (CRP), biochemical indicators (liver enzyme, \nmyocardial enzyme, renal function etc.), coagulation function, arteri al blood gas analysis, chest imaging and \ncytokines detection if necessary. 2.3 Timely providing effective oxygen therapy, including nasal catheter and \nmask oxygenation and nasal high -flow oxygen therapy. If possible, inhalation of mixed hydrogen and oxygen  \n(H2/O2: 66.6%/33.3%) can be applied. 2.4 Antiviral therapy: Hospitals can try Alpha -interferon (5 million U or \nequivalent dose each time for adults, adding 2ml of sterilized water, atomization inhalation twice daily), \nlopinavir/ritonavir (200 mg/50mg per pill for adults, two pills each time, twice daily, no longer than 10 days), \nRibavirin (suggested to be used jointly with interferon or lopinavir/ritonavir, 500 mg each time for adults, twice \nor three times of intravenous injection daily, no longer than 10 days), chloroquine phosphate (500 mg bid for \n7 days for adults aged 18 -65 with body weight over 50 kg; 500 mg bid for Days 1&2 and 500 mg qd for Days 3 -\n7 for adults with body weight below 50 kg), Arbidol (200 mg tid for adults, no longer than 10 days). Be aware \nof the adverse reactions, contraindications (for example, chloroquine cannot be used for patients with heart \ndiseases) and interactions of the above - mentioned drugs. Further evaluate the efficacy of those drugs \ncurrently being used. Using three or m ore antiviral drugs at the same time is not recommend; if an intolerable \ntoxic side effect occurs, the respective drug should be discontinued. For the treatment of pregnant women, \nissues such as the number of gestational weeks, choice of drugs having the l east impact on the fetus, as well \nas whether pregnancy being terminated before treatment should be considered with patients being informed \nof these considerations. 2.5 Antibiotic drug treatment: Blind or inappropriate use of antibiotic drugs should \nbe avoi ded, especially in combination with broad -spectrum antibiotics.  \n3. Treatment of severe and critical cases  \n3.1 Treatment principle: On the basis of symptomatic treatment, complications should be proactively \nprevented, underlying diseases should be treated, secondary infections also be prevented, and organ function \nsupport should be provided timely. 3.2 Respiratory support: 3.2.1 Oxygen therapy: Patients with severe \nsymptoms should receive nasal cannulas or masks for oxygen inhalation and timely assessment of  respiratory \ndistress and/or hypoxemia should be performed. 3.2.2 High -flow nasal -catheter oxygenation or noninvasive \nmechanical ventilation: When respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia of the patient cannot be alleviated after \nreceiving standard oxygen the rapy, high -flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy or non -invasive ventilation can be \nconsidered. If conditions do not improve or even get worse within a short time (1 -2 hours), tracheal intubation  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           66 \n and invasive mechanical ventilation should be used in a timely m anner. 3.2.3 Invasive mechanical ventilation: \nLung protective ventilation strategy, namely low tidal volume (6 -8ml/kg of ideal body weight) and low level of \nairway platform pressure (<30cmH2O) should be used to perform mechanical ventilation to reduce vent ilator -\nrelated lung injury. While the airway platform pressure maintained \u226430cmH2O, high PEEP can be used to keep \nthe airway warm and moist; avoid long sedation and wake the patient early for lung rehabilitation. There are \nmany cases of human -machine async hronization, therefore sedation and muscle relaxants should be used in \na timely manner. Use closed sputum suction according to the airway secretion, if necessary, administer \nappropriate treatment based on bronchoscopy findings. 3.2.4 Rescue therapy: Pulmon ary re -tensioning is \nrecommended for patients with severe ARDS. With sufficient human resources, prone position ventilation \nshould be performed for more than 12 hours per day. If the outcome of prone position ventilation is poor, \nextracorporeal membrane ox ygenation (ECMO) should be considered as soon as possible. Indications include: \n\u2460When Fi02 \uff1e90%, the oxygenation index is less than 80mmHg for more than 3 -4 hours; \u2461For patients with \nonly respiratory failure when the airway platform pressure \u2265 35cmH2O, VV -ECMO mode is preferred; if \ncirculatory support is needed, VA - ECMO mode should be used. When underlying diseases are under control \nand the cardiopulmonary function shows signs of recovery, withdrawal of ECMO can be tried. 3.3 Circulatory \nsupport: On the bas is of adequate fluid resuscitation, efforts should be made to improve microcirculation, use \nvasoactive drugs, closely monitor changes in blood pressure, heart rate and urine volume as well as lactate \nand base excess in arterial blood gas analysis. If neces sary, use non -invasive or invasive hemodynamic monitor \nsuch as Doppler ultrasound, echocardiography, invasive blood pressure or continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) \nmonitoring. In the process of treatment, pay attention to the liquid balance strategy to avoid  excessive or \ninsufficient fluid intake. If the heart rate suddenly increases more than 20% of the basic value or the decrease \nof blood pressure is more than 20% of the basic value with manifestations of poor skin perfusion and \ndecreased urine volume, make  sure to closely observe whether the patient has septic shock, gastrointestinal \nhemorrhage or heart failure.  \n3.4 Renal failure and renal replacement therapy: Active efforts should be made to look for causes for renal \nfunction damage in critical cases such as low perfusion and drugs. For the treatment of patients with renal \nfailure, focus should be on the balance of body fluid, acid and base and electrolyte balance, as well as on \nnutrition support including nitrogen balance and the supplementation of energie s and trace elements. For \ncritical cases, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used. The indications include: \u2460 \nhyperkalemia; \u2461 acidosis; \u2462 pulmonary edema or water overload; \u2463 fluid management in multiple organ \ndysfunction. 3.5 Convalescent plasma treatment: It is suitable for patients with rapid disease progression, \nsevere and critically ill patients. Usage and dosage should refer to Protocol of Clinical Treatment with \nConvale scent Plasma for NCP Patients (2nd trial version). 3.6 Blood purification treatment: Blood purification \nsystem including plasma exchange, absorption, perfusion and blood/plasma filtration can remove \ninflammatory factors and block \"cytokine storm\", so as to  reduce the damage of inflammatory reactions to \nthe body. It can be used for the treatment of severe and critical cases in the early and middle stages of cytokine \nstorm. 3.7 Immunotherapy: For patients with extensive lung lesions and severe cases who also show an \nincreased level of IL -6 in laboratory testing, Tocilizumab can be used for treatment. The initial dose is 4 -8mg/kg \nwith the recommended dose of 400mg diluted with 0.9% normal saline to 100ml. The infusion time should be \nmore than 1 hour. If the ini tial medication is not effective, one extra administration can be given after 12 hours \n(same dose as before). No more than two administrations should be given with the maximum single dose no \nmore than 800mg. Watch out for allergic reactions. Administration  is forbidden for people with active \ninfections such as tuberculosis.  \n3.8 Other therapeutic measures For patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators, rapid \nprogress in imaging and excessive activation of the body's inflammatory respo nse, glucocorticoids can be used \nin a short period of time (three to five days). It is recommended that dose should not exceed the equivalent \nof methylprednisolone 1 -2 mg/kg/day. Note that a larger dose of glucocorticoid will delay the removal of \ncoronavir us due to immunosuppressive effects. Xuebijing 100ml/time can be administered intravenously  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           67 \n twice a day. Intestinal microecological regulators can be used to maintain intestinal microecological balance \nand prevent secondary bacterial infections. Child seve re and critical cases can be given intravenous infusion \nof \u03b3-globulin. For pregnant severe and critical cases, pregnancy should be terminated preferably with c - \nsection. Patients often suffer from anxiety and fear and they should be supported by psychologi cal counseling.  \n4.

By February 14, 2020, it has led to 66 492 confirmed patien ts in China and high mortality \nup to ~2.96% (1123/37 914) in Wuhan. Here we report the first family case of coronavirus disease 2019 \n(COVID -19) confirmed in Wuhan and treated using the combination of western medicine and Chinese \ntraditional patent medicine  Shuanghuanglian oral liquid (SHL). This report describes the identification, \ndiagnosis, clinical course, and management of three cases from a family, suggests the expected therapeutic \neffects ofSHL on COVID -19, and warrants further clinical trials.  \nKeywor ds novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV); COVID -19; Chinese traditional patent medicine; Shuanghuanglian \noral liquid  \nIntroduction  \nSince December 31, 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia ofunknown cause has been reported in \nWuhan, China. This special pneumoni a was associated with a novel coronavirus, 2019 -nCoV, named initially \nby the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 [1]. An outbreak of 2019 -nCoV pneumonia (officially \nand inter - nationally named as COVID -19 on February 11, 2020 by the WHO) occurr ed and spread to the entire \nChina and multiple countries worldwide [2]. By February 14, the number of patients confirmed with COVID -19 \nreached 66 492, 8969 suspected patients, and 1523 deaths were identified in China [3]. By February 14, the \nnumber of conf irmed patients and deaths were 37 914 and 1123, respectively, and the mortality ofCOVID -19 \nwas 2.96% in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, which is considered as the origin of first cluster of patients [3]. The \nconfusing and difficult thing for physicians is that  they do not have specific drugs to either treat or prevent the \naggravation and serious complications of COVID -19 for such patients [4]. Thus, Chinese herbs attract our \nattention, and investiga - tions for different clinical trials are in progress. The pres ent report described a family \ncase, including three cases who received western medicine and Chinese traditional patent medicine \nShuanghuanglian oral liquid (SHL) treatments and achieved rapid recovery.  \nCase report   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           71 \n The family case includes parents and a dau ghter. The family lives in an apartment 3 km from the Huanan \nSeafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province. These cases are a typical familial cluster where all \nofthem had COVID -19 [5]. All the patients were informed about the clinical trial (ChiCTR200 0029605) and \nsigned informed consent. Case 1 is a 51 -year -old female. On January 17, 2020, the patient presented a feeling \nofgeneral malaise and coldness. On January 19, she had fever with body temperature of 37.3 \u00b0C and \nexperienced diarrhea and vomiting. She started to receive intravenous injection of cefotaxime in community \nclinic and took oral Jinyebaidu granules (another Chinese traditional patent medicine) and oselta - mivir (75 \nmg, twice a day) for 4 days. She had persistent severe fever with body temp erature from 37.6 \u00b0C to 38.3 \u00b0C for \nfour days. On January 23, her chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple patchy ground glass \nopacity and consolidation shadow in bilateral lung and subpleural regions (Fig. 1A). She was highly suspected \nwith COV ID-19. Oral moxifloxacin and arbidol were prescribed, and she continued to take Jinyebaidu granules \nand oseltamivir. On January 24, her body temperature reached 39.9 \u00b0C and experienced severe fatigue, \ndiarrhea, and breathlessness despite continuous treatme nts of the above drugs. She felt better after \nintravenous injection of immunoglobin (IVIG, 5 g per day) and dexamethasone (5 mg, once to twice a day). \nHowever, the patient experienced recurrent fever (body temperature of 39 \u00b0C) and breathlessness, and her \nblood oxygen saturation fluctuated from 90% to 95% at the night of January 27. On January 28, the second \nchest CT scan indicated that her pneumonia aggravated for the past 5 days (Fig. 1B). A nasopharyngeal swab \nspecimen was obtained and sent for detection  of 2019 -nCoV. Although the patient\u2019s 2019 -nCoV test was \nnegative (Table 1), she was diagnosed of COVID -19 in accordance with her symptoms and chest CT display. On \nthe same day, she was confined into an isolation ward and started to take oral SHL (twice a day, 20 mL once). \nOn the next day, SHL administration increased to three times a day (20 mL once) without using any other \ndrugs. From January 29 to 31, the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved with body temperature decreasing from 37.3 \n\u00b0C to 36.5 \u00b0C and without vom iting and diarrhea. The patient gradually felt strong except for slight cough. After \nFebruary 6, the patient\u2019s symptoms disappeared, and her third chest CT scan (Fig. 1C) showed significant \nabsorption of bilateral ground glass opacity compared with the pre vious ones. The association of her \nsymptoms with treatments is shown in Fig. 2, and the clinical laboratory results are shown in Table 2. Cases 2 \nand 3 became simultaneously ill 9 days after they had close contacts with case 1 [5]  \n \n \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           72 \n  \nCase 2 is a 27 -year -old female nurse at the clinical trial center of Division of Cardiology of Tongji Hospital, \nWuhan, daughter of case 1, who took care of her mother. On January 26, the patient presented mild weakness, \ndiarrhea, and low fever, and she sta rted to take oral Jinyebaidu granules, oseltamivir, moxifloxacin, and arbi - \ndol. On the next day, all her symptoms aggravated with body temperature reaching to 38.3 \u00b0C, frequent \nvomiting, and diarrhea for 5 times a day. At the night of January 27, her body  temperature reached 39.5 \u00b0C \nwith chest tightness and shortness of breath. Although she took nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug \n(loxoprofen), her fever remained high (39 \u00b0C). On January 28, her chest CT scan showed consolidation shadow \nin the left lung, a nd her 2019 -nCoV test showed negative using nasopharyngeal swab speci - men. Considering \nher contact history with her mother, she was also confined into an isolation ward and started to take SHL 20 \nmL once for three times a day without taking other drugs. H er body temperature ranged from 37.5 \u00b0C to 38.5 \n\u00b0C during January 29 to 31 and decreased from 37.5 \u00b0C to 36.5 \u00b0C on February 1. All other symptoms resolved \non February 2 with recovered appetite and spirit. Two repeated 2019 -nCoV tests were negative (Table 1). On \nFebruary 6, her second chest CT scan showed the absorption of the left lung shadow (Fig. 3). After her disease \nsymptoms disappeared, the oral dose of SHL reduced to 10 mL once for three times a day. The patient\u2019s clinical \nlaboratory results are show n in Table 3. Case 3 is a 53 -year -old male, husband of case 1 and father of case 2, \nwho presented mild diarrhea, vomiting, and fever on January 26. On January 28, the patient was diagnosed of \nCOVID -19 with positive 2019 -nCoV test using nasopharyngeal swab specimen (Table 1) and chest CT scan \nshowing patchy ground glass opacity in the right lower lung subpleural fields (Fig. 4). He had no fever, cough, \nand breathlessness. Thus, the patient started to isolate himself at home and took SHL (20 mL once, three ti mes \na day), moxifloxacin, and arbidol on January 28.  \nSince February 2, all his symptoms resolved with exception of light nausea, and he continued taking SHL with \nother drugs. On February 4, he felt slightly weak. On February 7, the patient fully recovered , and the repeated \n2019 -nCoV RNA test was negative (Table 1).Niu, M., R. Wang, Z. Wang, P. Zhang, Z. Bai, J.

The three patients were a close family, and the \nmother was the first victim with typical symptoms of severe viral pneumonia and confirmed as COVID -19 in \naccordance with the symptoms and chest CT scan. Cases 2 and 3 had close contact history with case 1, and 9 \ndays later they became ill with positive diagnosis of COVID -19. All their symptoms resolved after using the \nChinese traditional patent medicine SHL and rapidly recovered without obvious adverse effects when the \npatients showed no response and their symptoms continued to aggravate after other treatments, including \nIVIG (5 g per day) and dexamethasone, antibiotics, and antivirus compounds. SHL, a Chinese tr aditional patent \nmedicine containing extracts of three Chinese herbs, namely, honeysuckle, forsythia, and Scutellaria \nbaicalensis, is usually used to treat cold, sore throat, and cough with fever. SHL has been used in clinical \npractice for a long time beca use of its affordable cost and no serious adverse reaction. Recent news from \npreliminary study findings indicated that SHL can inhibit 2019 -nCoV (http://www.cas.cn/yw/202001/ \nt20200131_4733137.shtml, accessed on January 31, 2020). Considering that no speci fic drugs are recom - \nmended to treat COVID -19, we started our clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029605) to investigate whether SHL can \ntreat this disease and the family case is a part ofthe clinical trial. These cases suggest that SHL might be \neffective for COVID -19 although subsequent clinical trials are needed. In this family case report, we described \ntwo patients who had poor response to other treatments but responded well to SHL therapy. Case 3 showed \npositive therapeutic effect although he simultaneously recei ved arbidol. Early treat - ments may contribute to \npatients\u2019 outcome and several errors, including taking antibiotics, and combination of two antivirus drugs \nshould be avoided. This report suggests that SHL treatment might be effective for COVID -19 and warr ants \nsubsequent clinical trials to obtain sufficient evidence for clinical recommendation.  \nAcknowledgements  \nThis work was supported by Tongji Hospital Clinical Research Flagship Program (No. 2019CR207).

Summary The current 2019 -nCoV outbreak is moving \nrapidly [1], the cumulative number of confirmed cases in mainland China has reached 80151, with 47,204 \n(58.89 %) cured cases and 2943 (3.67 %) deaths as  of 2-Mar-2020, and no specific drug has been discovered \nfor Cor - onavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19). However, a number of clinical practice results showed that \ntraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays significant role in the treatment of COVID -19, bringing new hope for \nthe prevention and control of COVID -19. TCM has a long history and played an indispensable role in the  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           75 \n prevention and treatment of several epidemic diseases. During the SARS epidemic in 2003, the intervention \nof TCM has also achieved remark - able therapeutic effect. During the treatment period of COVID -19, more \nthan 3100 medical staff of TCM were dispatched to Hubei province, and TCM scheme was included in the \nguideline on diagnosis and treatment of COVID -19 [2], and TCM experts fully participa te in the whole rescue \nprocess. The decoction, Chinese patent medicine, acupuncture and other characteristic therapy of TCM was \ncomprehensively employed, mainly treated based on syndrome differentiation. Specific TCM wards were set \nup, and established the designated hospital, moreover, TCM team participates in treatment collectively. \nCurrently, the total number of confirmed cases treated by TCM has reached 60,107 [3]. In 102 cases of mild \nsymptoms treated with TCM, the clinical symptom dis - appearance time was shortened by 2 days, the recovery \ntime of body temperature was shortened by 1.7 days, the average length of stay in hospital was shortened by \n2.2 days, the improvement rate of CT image was increased by 22 %, the clinical cure rate was increased by 33 \n%, 27.4 % reduction in the rate of common to severe cases and 70 % in - crease in lymphocyte.3 In addition, in \nthe treatment of severe patients with TCM, the average length of stay in hospital and the time of nucleic acid \nturning negative has been shortened by more than 2 days. From current treatment results, TCM based on an \nover -all symptoms of 2019 -nCoV pneumonia patients, has suggested to prescribe pre - scription that are likely \nto be effective, such as qingfei paidu decoction (QPD), gancaoganjiang decocti on, sheganmahuang decoction, \nqingfei touxie fuzheng recipe, etc. QPD which consisted of Ephedrae Herba, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma \nPraeprata cum Melle, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, Cinnamomi Ramulus, Alismatis \nRhizoma, Polyporus, Atractylod is Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Poria, Bupleuri Radix, Scutellariae Radix, Pinelliae \nRhizoma Praepratum cum Zingibere et Alumine, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Asteris Radix et Rhizoma, Farfarae \nFlos, Belamcandae Rhizoma, Asari Radix et Rhizoma, Dioscoreae Rhizoma,  Aurantii Fructus Immaturus, Citri \nReticulatae Pericarpium, and Pogostemonis Herba, has been promoted as a general prescription in the \ndiagnosis and treatment plan of COVID -19 in China [2]. Among the 701 confirmed cases treated by QPD, 130 \ncases were cured  and discharge clinical symptoms of 51 cases disappeared, 268 cases of symptoms improved, \nand 212 cases of stable symptoms without aggravation [3]. The effective cure rate of QPD against COVID -19 is \nover 90 %. Ac - cording to the theory of TCM, the target o rgan location of COVID -19 is the lung, and the etiology \nattribute is \u201cdamp and toxin plague\u201d. The network pharmacology analysis showed that QPD has an overall reg - \nulatory effect via multi -component and multi -target. The primary site of pharmacological act ion is the lung, as \n16 herbs to lung meridian, which indicated that the decoction is mainly specific for lung diseases. In addition, \nit can play the role of dehumidification through the rise and fall of the spleen and stomach, and exhibited the \nprotection for heart, kidney and other organs. Among the potential targets screen, most of them co -expressed \nwith ACE -2, the receptor of COVID -19, indicating the potential improvement of COVID -19. It can inhibit the \nreplication of COVID -19 by acting on multiple ribos omal proteins. COVID -19 can lead to strong immune \nresponse and inflammatory storm [4]. Functional enrichment analysis showed that QPD could inhibit and \nalleviate ex - cessive immune response and eliminate inflammation by regulating immune related pathway an d \ncytokine action related pathway [5]. Furthermore, through the prediction of molecular docking, it was found \nthat patchouli alcohol, ergosterol and shionone in the formula had better anti\u2212COVID -19 effect, which \nprovided new molecule structures for new dru g development [6]. Here, we take one highly suspected COVID -\n19 patient treated with TCM as a case example to show its effectiveness [7]. The male patient was on a \nbusiness trip in Wuhan for several days before the onset of the disease. During the admission  period, fever \nand cough were repeated, and respiratory rales of both lungs were not obvious. Western medicine was used \nfirstly, including orally take oseltamivir phosphate capsule, intravenous infusion of ganciclovir, aerosol \ninhalation of recombinant hum an interferon a1b, etc. Although the nucleic acid test was negative, the results \nof chest CT showed that the fusion of two lung ground glass shadows was enlarged and the density was \nincreased, which was more advanced than that of admission (Fig. 1a -1c). As  the serious illness, combined with \nthe patient's performance of damp -heat syndrome, and the heat is more serious than damp, QPD was added \nfor treatment. On the night of administration, the body temperature dropped to 36.2 \u2103, and then tended to \nbe normal. After 6 days of treatment, chest CT was better than before, tracheobronchial shadow was normal, \nand in - flammation was obviously absorbed (Fig. 1d). The patient had no fever or asthenia, coughing  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           76 \n occasionally, and the rales of two lungs were weaker than be fore. After discharge, continue to take 7 doses of \nthe prescription, occasionally cough, no special discomfort was found. The clinical symptoms and imaging \nexamination of the patients improved significantly after the treatment, reflecting the advantages of  TCM. TCM \nhas own characteristics such as holistic concept, balance of Yin and Yang, syndrome differentiation and \ntreatment, strengthening the body resistance to eliminate pathogenic factors. TCM has thousands of years of \nexperience in regulating the body and enhancing the resistance to epidemic diseases, with unique insights and \nprevention and control experience. For mild and common patients, the early intervention of TCM can \neffectively prevent the disease from transforming into severe and critical diseas e. In the severe cases, TCM \nhas won time for rescuing them by improving symptoms (http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwfbh/ \nxwbfbh/wqfbh/42311/42560/index.htm).  \nTreatment practice of COVID -19 showed that early intervention of TCM is important way to improve cure rate , \nshorten the course of disease, delay disease pro - gression and reduce mortality rate. Furthermore, the reason \nwhy TCM works is not only to inhibit the virus, but might block the infection, regulate the immune response, \ncut off the inflammatory storm, and  promote the repair of the body. Moreover, the prevention and control \nmeasures of COVID -19 fully reflect the ideology of \u201cpreventive treat - ment of disease\u201d. Apart from the \nepidemic diseases recorded in the Han Dynasty should be isolated, the preventive me asures of TCM also in - \nclude psychology, sports, diet, medication, etc. In the next prevention and control work of COVID -19, it should \ngive full play to the advantages of TCM in syndrome differentiation and the whole therapeutic effect, reduce \nthe complica tions as well as death rate. Besides, the scientific research should also be carried out on the TCM \nwith definite curative effective of COVID -19, to comprehensively evaluating its action mechanism and in -depth \nunderstanding COVID - 19. \n \nDeclaration of Comp eting Interest There are no conflicts to declare.  \nAcknowledgments  \nThis work was supported by grants from the Voluntary Research  \nProject of 2019 -nCoV Pneumonia, and Key Program of Natural Science Foundation of State (Grant No. \n81830110, 81861168037, 819737 45, 81903818, 81430093), Heilongjiang Touyan Innovation Team Program  \nAppendix A.

Synthetic sugar alternatives such as Splenda are harmful to the nervous system and should \nalso be avoided. Use maple syrup, local honey, or coconut sugar for sweetening.  \n2. Increase your intake of naturally occurring trace minerals, which make the body more alkaline and have the \npotential to prevent infection. For inst ance, use Bio Nativus\u2019 Ionic Trace Minerals (a trace mineral extract made \nfrom concentrated water from the Great Salt Lake). Add 5 -15 drops to every glass of water or liquid you drink, \nup to 5x/day.  \n3. Gargle with saltwater after brushing your teeth, prefe rably with a full -spectrum natural salt such as Real \nSalt.  \n4. Get a skin brush and start brushing your skin after showering in the morning, especially the head, neck and \nchest areas. This will stimulate lymphatic circulation and increase your general feeli ng of vitality and well -\nbeing.  \n5. Apply essential oils before going out in public, either in the form of an anti -viral massage oil (applied to the \nchest, neck and lower arm areas) or an anti -viral \u201cperfume\u201d (applied to the area below the nostrils). During \nthe bubonic plague in the middle ages, essential oils prevented the professions of perfumers (who exclusively \nworked with oils on a daily basis) and thieves (who fortified themselves with oils before burglarizing \nabandoned houses) to become ravaged by the pandemic. Since different viruses thrive in the environment \nevery year, the types of appropriate oils also vary from year to year. Of the many types of essential oils \navailable on the market, I have found that the following oils have proven to be most effe ctive for the \nprevention and treatment of upper respiratory infections in early 2020:  \n\u2022 Eucalyptus \u2022 Tea Tree \u2022 Niaouli \u2022 Lemon\u2022 Cinnamon leaf \u2022 Clove \u2022 Rosemary \u2022 Thyme  \n\u2022 Frankincense \u2022 Myrtle   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           78 \n Any or all of the oils described above can be mixed together t o produce an essential oil blend. Massage oils \nshould incorporate 30 drops of essential oils per ounce (blended into a base of high -quality olive oil or apricot \nseed oil). \u201cPerfumes\u201d should be mixed 50/50 with a base oil like jojoba oil or apricot seed oil , and used by \napplying 1 -2 drops of the blend to the area below the nostrils. Alternatively, according to a recent report I \nreceived, Chinese medicine practitioners during the 1938 epidemic in China successfully swabbed their nostrils \nwith vinegar before s eeing afflicted patients.  \n6. Additionally, the internal application of Chinese herbs has been proven effective in the prevention and \ntreatment of both the COVID -19 and SARS strains during the 21st century coronavirus epidemics in mainland \nChina. For my rec ent suggestions to natural medicine practitioners flooded by the question of how to best \nprotect oneself during the current season of respiratory vulnerability see my separate article, \u201cInitial Thoughts \non Coronavirus Prevention and Treatment with Chinese Medicine\u201d.  \n \n30.

Among the confirmed cases, 1527 were severe cases, 171 had recovered and been discharged at \nhome, and 213 died.  And among these cases, a total of 28 children aged from 1 month to 17 years have been \nreported in China. For standardizing prevention and management of 2019 -nCoV infections in children, we \ncalled up an experts\u2019 committee to formulate this experts\u2019 consens us statement. This statement is based on \nthe Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards (the fourth edition) (National \nHealth Committee) and other previous diagnosis and treatment strategies for pediatric virus infections. The \npresent consensus statement summarizes current strategies on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 2019 -\nnCoV infection in children.  \nBackground  \nIn December, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases, who were later proven to be caused by a novel coronavirus \n(named as \u201c2019 -nCoV\u201d), emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,  \nChina. By January 30, 2020, 9692 confirmed cases and 15,238 suspected cases have been reported around 31 \nprov - inces and cities in China. Among the confirmed cases, 1527 were severe  cases, 171 had recovered and \nbeen discharged at home, and 213 died. Twenty -eight confirmed cases aged from 1 month to 17 years had \nbeen reported in China [1]. Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Nidovirales order. CoVs are \ndivided into four genera: \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-coronavirus. \u03b1- and \u03b2-coronaviruses only infect mammals, whereas \n\u03b3- and \u03b4-coronaviruses mainly infect birds, with a few infecting mammals. Human CoVs include \u03b1-\ncoronaviruses (229E and NL63), \u03b2-coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1), t he Middle East respiratory syndrome - \nrelated coronavirus (MERS -CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome -related coronavirus (SARS -CoV), and \n2019 - nCoV. The 2019 -nCoV belongs to the \u03b2-coronavirus genus [2], which includes bat -SARS -like (SL) -\nCoVZC45, bat - SL-CoVZXC21, SARS -CoV, MERS -CoV, and 2019 -nCoV. Current studies have revealed that 2019 - \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           79 \n nCoV may originate from wild animals, but the exact origin remains unclear. 2019 -nCoV infected patients are \nthe main infection sources. However, we also should attach impo rtance to asymptomatic cases which may \nplay a critical role in the transmission process. Respiratory droplets and contact are the main transmission \nroutes [3]. Close contact with symptomatic cases and asymptomatic cases with silent infection are the main \ntransmission routes of 2019 -nCoV infection in children. People of all ages are susceptible to 2019 -nCoV. The \nelderly and those with underlying chronic diseases are more likely to become severe cases. Thus far, all \npediatric cases with laboratory -confirmed 2 019-nCoV infection were mild cases, and no deaths had been \nreported. For standardizing the prevention and treament of 2019 -nCoV infections in children, we called up an \nexperts\u2019 com - mittee to formulate this consensus statement. This statement is based on t he Novel Coronavirus \nInfection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards (the fourth edition) (National Health Committee) \nand other previous diagnosis and treatment strategies for pediatric virus infections.  \nClinical manifestations  \nBased on the current e pidemiological data, the incubation period of 2019 -nCoV infections ranges from 1 to 14 \ndays, mostly ranging from 3 to 7 days. Current reported data of pediatric cases revealed that the age of disease \nonset ranged from 1.5 months to 17 years, most of whom h ad a close contact with infected cases or were \nfamily cluster cases [4]. Infected children might appear asymptomatic [5] or present with fever, dry cough, \nand fatigue, and few have upper res - piratory symptoms including nasal congestion and running nose; s ome \npatients presented with gastrointestinal symp - toms including abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain, and diarrhea. Most infected children have mild clinical manifestations.  \nThey have no fever or symptoms of pneumonia with a good progno sis. Most of them recover within 1 \u20132 weeks \nafter disease onset. Few may progress to lower respiratory infections. No newborns delivered by 2019 -nCoV \ninfected mothers have been detected positive; and no newborn cases have been reported yet. It should be \nnoted that clinical manifestations in pediatric patients should be further defined after collecting more pediat - \nric case data. Furthermore, the number of confirmed infected cases will increase after a wide use of pathogen \nanalysis. Data from adults reveal th at severe cases often develop dyspnea one week after disease onset. \nSevere cases may rap - idly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, refractory \nmetabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction [6, 7]. Although no deaths in ch ildren have been reported up \nto now, the potential risk of death should be highlighted. Though clinical symptoms in pediatric patients are \nrelatively milder compared with those in adult patients, ARDS and death cases also occurred in infected \nchildren duri ng the SARS and MERS epidemics [8 \u201311]. \nAuxiliary examinations Laboratory examination [3]  \n1. In the early phase of the disease, white blood cell count is normal or decreased, with decreased lymphocyte \ncount; liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myohemo - globi n levels are increased in some patients.  \n2. Most patients display elevated C -reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and normal \nproc - alcitonin levels.  \n3. Severe cases show high D -dimer levels and progres - sively decreased blood lymphocytes counts.  \n4. Samples from throat swabs (better using nasopharyn - geal swab in children), sputum, lower respiratory \ntract secretions, stool and blood, etc. are tested pos itive for 2019 -nCoV nucleic acids.  \nChest imaging examination [3]  \nSuspected cases or confirmed cases should undertake chest X -ray examination as soon as possible. Chest CT \nscan is required when necessary. In the early stage of disease, chest images show mul tiple small plaques and \ninterstitial changes, which are obvious in the lung periphery, further deteriorate to bilateral multiple ground -\nglass opacity and/or infiltrat - ing shadows. Lung consolidation may occur in severe cases. Pleural effusion is \nrarely se en.  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           80 \n Diagnosis  \nSuspected cases  \n2019 -nCoV should be suspected in patients who meet any one of the criteria in the epidemiological history \nand any two of the criteria in clinical manifestations.  \nEpidemiological history  \n1.

Acute upper respiratory tract infection Children with only fever, cough, pharyngeal pain, nasal congestion, \nfatigue, headache, myalgia or dis - comfort, etc., and without signs of pneumonia by chest imaging or sepsis.  \n3. Mild pneumonia Children with or without fever, respiratory symptoms such as cough; and chest imaging \nindicating pneumonia, but not reaching the criteria of severe pneumonia.  \n4. Severe pneumonia Meeting any of the following criteria [3, 12 \u201315]: \n(1) Increased respiratory rate: \u2265 70 times/min (< 1 year), \u2265 50 times/min (\u2265 1 year) (af ter ruling out the effects \nof fever and crying);  \n(2) Oxygen saturation < 92%; (3) Hypoxia: assisted breathing (moans, nasal flaring, and three concave sign), \ncyanosis, intermittent apnea;  \n(4) Disturbance of consciousness: somnolence, coma, or convulsion;  \n(5) Food refusal or feeding difficulty, with signs of dehydration.  \n5. Critical cases Those who meet any of the following criteria and require ICU care:  \n(1) Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; (2) Shock; (3) Combined with other organs failu re. \nEarly identification of critical cases  \nAccording to the experiences in diagnosis and treatment of community -acquired pneumonia in children, \nchildren with a history of contact with severe 2019 -nCoV infected cases, or with underlying conditions (such \nas congenital heart disease, bronchial pulmonary hypoplasia, respiratory tract anomaly, with abnormal \nhemoglobin level, severe malnutri - tion), or with immune deficiency or immunocompromised status (under \nlong -term use of immunosuppressants) who meet any one of the following criteria may become severe cases:  \n1. Dyspnea: respiratory rate > 50 times/min for 2 \u201312 months old; > 40 times/min for 1 \u20135 years old; > 30 \ntimes/min in patients over 5 years old (after ruling out the effects of fever and crying);  \n2. Persist ent high fever for 3 \u20135 days; 3. Poor mental response, lethargy, disturbance of con - sciousness, and \nother changes of consciousness;  \n4. Abnormally increased enzymatic indexes, such as myo - cardial enzymes, liver enzymes, lactate \ndehydrogenase;  \n5. Unexplaina ble metabolic acidosis; 6. Chest imaging findings indicating bilateral or multi -lobe infiltration, \npleural effusion, or rapid progression of con - ditions during a very short period;  \n7. Infants younger than 3 months; 8. Extrapulmonary complications; 9. Coin fection with other viruses and/or \nbacteria.  \nDifferential diagnosis [3]  \nDifferential diagnosis should be made to distinguish from influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, \nrespira - tory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, SARS corona virus, and other known viral \ninfections, as well as mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumo - nia and bacterial pneumonia. The \ncoinfection of 2019 -nCoV with other viruses and/or bacteria should be considered in diagnosis.  \nGeneral treatment  \nThe general tr eatment strategies include bed rest and sup - portive treatment; ensuring sufficient calory and \nwater intake; maintaining water electrolyte balance and homeo - stasis; monitoring vital signs and oxygen \nsaturation; keep - ing respiratory tract unobstructed and  inhaling oxygen when necessary; measuring blood \nroutine, urine routine, C -reac - tive protein, and other blood biochemical indexes including liver and kidney  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           82 \n function, myocardial enzyme spectrum, and coagulation function according to patients\u2019 conditions. Blood gas \nanalysis and timely re -examination of chest imag - ing should be performed when necessary.  \nSymptomatic treatment  \nThe patients with high fever should be actively controlled. If patients\u2019 body temperature exceeds 38.5 \u00b0C with \nobvi - ous discomfort, p hysical cooling (warm water bath, use of antipyretic patch, etc.) or antipyretic drug \ntreatment should be performed. Common drugs include: ibuprofen orally, 5 \u201310 mg/kg every time; \nacetaminophen orally, 10 \u201315 mg/kg every time. Keep children quiet and admini strate sedatives immediately \nwhen convulsions or seizure occur.  \nOxygen therapy  \nWhen hypoxia appears, effective oxygen therapy should be given immediately including nasal catheter, mask \noxy- gen. Nasal high -flow oxygen therapy, and non -invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation should be \nundertaken when necessary.  \nAntiviral therapy Interferon -\u03b1 [3, 16 \u201328] \nInterferon -\u03b1 can reduce viral load in the early stage of infection which can help to alleviate symptoms and \nshorten the course of disease. Based on our cl inical research and World Journal of Pediatrics experiences of \nusing interferon -\u03b1 in treating bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, acute upper respiratory tract infection, hand foot \nmouth disease, SARS, and other viral infections in children, the recommended us age is as follows:  \n1. Interferon -\u03b1 nebulization: interferon -\u03b1 200,000 \u2013 400,000 IU/kg or 2 \u20134 \u03bcg/kg in 2 mL sterile water, nebu - \nlization two times per day for 5 \u20137 days;  \n2. Interferon -\u03b12b spray: applied for high -risk populations with a close contact with suspected 2019 -nCoV \ninfected patients or those in the early phase with only upper res - piratory tract symptoms. Patients should use \n1\u20132 sprays on each side of the nasal cavity, 8 \u201310 spra ys on the oro - pharynx, the dose of interferon -\u03b12b per \ninjection is 8000 IU, once every 1 \u20132 hours, 8 \u201310 sprays/day for a course of 5 \u20137 days.  \nLopinavir/litonavir [3, 29, 30]  \nLopinavir/litonavir has been tried to apply to the treatment of adult patients with  2019 -nCoV pneumonia, but \nits effi - cacy and safety remain to be determined.  \nUsage of other agents Antibiotics [3, 12]  \nAvoiding irrational use of antibiotics, especially in combina - tion with broad -spectrum antibiotics. Paying close \nattention to the change s of conditions in children with coinfection of bacterial or fungal infection; actively \ncollecting samples for pathogen analysis and timely or rational use of antibiotics or anti -fungal drugs.  \nArbidol [31], oseltamivir [32] and other anti -influenza drugs  \nArbidol is administrated for adults infected with 2019 -nCoV; however, its efficacy and safety remain unclear. \nOseltamivir and other anti -influenza agents can be applied for patients coinfected with other influenza virus.  \nOther drugs [3, 12] Glucocorticoids  \nThe use of glucocorticoids should be based on the severity of systemic inflammatory response, degree of \ndyspnea, with or without ARDS, and the progress status of chest imag - ing results. Glucocorticoids can be used \nin a short period (3 \u20135 days). The recomme nded dose of methylprednisolone should not exceed 1 \u20132 \nmg/kg/day.  \nImmunoglobulin   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           83 \n Immunoglobulin can be used in severe cases when indicated, but its efficacy needs further evaluation. \nTreatment of severe and critically ill cases [3, 12]  \nOn the basis of symptomatic treatment, we should actively prevent and treat complications, underlying \ndiseases, sec - ondary infection, and provide organ function support as indicated.  \nRespiratory support  \nChildren who undergo non -invasive mechanical ventila tion for 2 hours without improvements in conditions, \nor cannot tolerate non -invasive ventilation, with increased airway secretions, severe cough, or hemodynamic \ninstability, should be subjected to invasive mechanical ventilation promptly. The invasive mech anical \nventilation should adopt low tidal volume \u201clung protective ventilation strategy\u201d to reduce ventilator related \nlung injury. If necessary, prone position ventilation, lung recruitment, or extracorporeal membrane \noxygenation (ECMO) can be applied.  \nCirculation support  \nOn the basis of full fluid resuscitation, improve microcircu - lation, use vasoactive drugs, and monitor \nhemodynamics if necessary.  \nTraditional Chinese medicine  \nThis disease belongs to the epidemic disease category of Traditional Chinese Med icine and results from \ncontract - ing epidemic pathogens. Different regions can refer to the following plans for dialectical treatment \naccording to the patient\u2019s conditions, local climate features, and physical characteristics of children.  \nClinical treatmen t period 1.

If patients (especially older children) \nshow mood swing, fear, or psychological disorders, active psychological intervention and treatment are \nneeded.  \nRelease and discharge criteria [3]  \nConfirmed patients can be discharged from isolation or transferre d to the corresponding departments for \ntreatment of other diseases if all the following criteria are met:  \n1. The body temperature returns to normal longer than 3 days;  \n2. The respiratory symptoms improve obviously;  \n3. The detection of respiratory pathogeni c nucleic acid is negative for two consecutive times (the sampling \ninter - val is at least 1 day).  \nSuspected patients can be discharged from isolation when the detection of respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid \nis nega - tive for two consecutive times (the sam pling interval is at least 1 day).  \nPrevention [33 \u201335] \nNovel coronavirus infection is a new communicable dis - ease with an emergent outbreak that affects all \npopula - tions. 2019 -nCoV infection has been classified as category B infectious disease legally but  managed as  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           85 \n category A infectious disease. It is paramount to implement infection control practices by infection source \ncontrolling, transmis - sion route blocking, and susceptible population protection.  \nControlling infection sources  \nPatients infected with 2019 -nCoV are the main infection sources. Children infected by novel coronavirus \nshould be isolated at home or admitted to designated hospitals under the guidance of healthcare workers \ndepending on the severity of their medical conditions. Try to provide s ingle rooms for isolated children, and \nreduce the chance of con - tact with the co -residents. There are enormous demands for room ventilation, \nnecessary cleaning, and disinfection work for the articles used by children. Equally crucial is the need of \nequipm ent with disposable masks and properly disposal after use when taking care of the sick.  \nBlocking transmission routes  \n1. Preventing transmission by respiratory droplets and contact: Cover mouth and nose with napkin or towel \nwhen coughing or sneezing. Wash h ands for children frequently, or teach children seven -step washing tech - \nnique. Try not to touch mouth, nose, or eyes before cleaning hands thoroughly after returning from public \nplaces, after covering the mouth when coughing, before eating or after using toilet; regularly disinfecting toys \nby heating at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min, 75% alcohol or chlorine - containing disinfectants, and ultraviolet rays.  \n2. Reduce exposure to infection: Avoid public transport at epidemic areas, and wear masks when going to \ncrowded or poorly ventilated public places; avoid touching or eat ing wild animals, and going to markets selling \nwith live animals.  \n3. Children\u2019s health monitoring: Children with a history of close contacts of infected patients need to be \nmonitored for body temperatu re and clinical features routinely. When presenting with suspicious symptoms, \nchildren should be taken to a designated hospital for screening. Newborns delivered by infected mothers must \ncomplete a pathogen test and be isolated in a single ward or at home according to their medical conditions.  \nBoosting immunity  \nBalanced diet, oral health, adequate exercise, regular rest, avoiding excessive fatigue, and boosting immunity \nare the powerful measures to preventing infection, as well as main - taining emotional st ability and mental \nhealth. Vaccination is an effective way to prevent virus infection. The research and development of anti -virus \nvaccines has been carried out in China at present.  \nAuthor contributions All authors contributed equally to this paper. Funding None.

Peilin Sun & Wen Sheng Zhou  \nAbstract  \nThe coronavirus COVID -19 has presented a serious new threat to humans since the first case was reported in \nWuhan, China on 31 December 2019. By the end of February 2020 the virus has spread to 57 countries with \nnearly 86,000 cases, and there is currently no effective vaccination available. Chinese herbal medicine has \nbeen used in this epidemic with encouragi ng results, but with concerns regarding disturbance of patients\u2019 \ndigestive function. This study aims to explore the role of acupuncture in treating COVID -19 by investigating \nrelevant current literature along with classical Chinese medicine texts on epidemi cs. Based on this analysis, \nacupuncture points and strategies are suggested for practitioners to use as a guide to treatment.  \nKeywords Coronavirus, COVID -19, acupuncture, Chinese medicine, ghost points, infection, epidemic, \npandemic.  \nIntroduction  \nCoronavir uses (CoV) can cause severe diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS -CoV) or Middle \nEast respiratory syndrome (MERS -CoV). The first case of a novel zoonotic coronavirus (nCoV) was reported in \nWuhan, China on 31 December 2019 and it now present s a serious threat to humans. One month later, nCov \nbecame a global emergent health issue and was renamed COVID -19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). \nBy 29 February (the time of writing), 38 days after the lockdown in Wuhan, China has 79,394 reported cases \nand 2,838 deaths, while 85,641 cases have been reported globally across 57 countries with 2,933 deaths.1 \nAmong those infected, 20 per cent are in intensive care. The WHO has already released 675 million dollars to \nhelp combat this global emergency, t o cover the period from February to April, and has also gathered 300 top \nhealthprofessionals internationally to develop a vaccine before COVID -19 becomes pandemic. Despite \nChinesemedicine experts apparently not being included in these efforts, in reality m any studies from affected \nhospitals in China have reported that Chinese medicine has been playing an important role in the battle against \nCOVID - 19.5,6  \nDisappointingly, according to some Chinese medical academics, in some locations acupuncture has not \nfeatured as a treatment throughout the course of patients\u2019 infection, but only during the recovery period.7 \nChinese medicine has a recorded history of over two thousand years of combating epidemics, with \nacupuncture playing a vital role alongside herbal medici ne. For instance, Wu Youke (1580 -1660) in his text \nZhen Jing (Acupuncture Canons) pointed out how infectious qi attacks the human body via the mouth and \nnose and then penetrates inwards, as well as noting which acupoints should be employed in treatment.8 T his \nstudy provides acupuncture strategies to treat COVID -19 and is based on both classical Chinese medicine \ntheory and current literature. The aim of this article is to shed new light on this urgent health struggle, and to \nhelp acupuncture practitioners co ntribute to their local communities. Clinical manifestations of COVID -19 \nChen et al.9 and Wang et al.10 each reported a case series based in two separate hospitals 10 miles apart in \nWuhan during January 2020, which included a total of 237 subjects presenti ng with COVID19. Chen et al.\u2019s \nstudy documented infected patients as presenting with signs of fever (83 per cent) and cough (82 per cent), \nfollowed by dyspnoea (31 per cent), confusion (11 per cent) and headache (8 per cent), while 1 to 5 per cent \nof patie nts exhibited sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting; 68 per cent of  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           89 \n patients were male, 51 per cent experienced chronic illness and 75 per cent developed bilateral pneumonia. \nWang et al.\u2019s study reported the main symptoms as being fever (98.6 per cent), fatigue (69.6 per cent), dry \ncough (59.4 per cent), myalgia (34.8 per cent) and dyspnoea (31.2 per cent), with 54.3 per cent of the patients \nbeing male. Most of the patients in the two studies received antibiotic and antiviral treatments. The authors \nconcluded that hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular illness and malignancy are common comorbidities of \nCOVID -19. Wang et al. point out that the best approach to COVID -19 is to avoid becoming infected in the first \nplace, as the med ication currently available is ineffective. A few points are worth drawing out from these two \nreports:  \n\u2022 There are big differences in the major clinical manifestations of the illness as outlined in the two studies.  \n\u2022 A fair number of patients showed atyp ical symptoms, such as diarrhoea and nausea. \u2022 Major complications \nappeared during hospitalisation, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia and shock (Wang et \nal.).  \n\u2022 Traditional Chinese medicine texts that describe how epidemics have been  fought through Chinese history \ncan be used to address these points.  \nThe Chinese medicine understanding of epidemic disease. The original Chinese term for epidemic, li yi ( \u623e\u75ab , \nliterally \u2018ferocious epidemic\u2019), has a recorded history of over two thousand yea rs. In 524 BCE, the Zhou dynasty \nking Jing was admonished for his luxurious lifestyle, which he was advised put him at risk of contracting li ( \u623e, \nferocious qi).11 Mozi (4th Century BCE) also mentions li yi, which was interpreted by Johnston (2010) as \n\u2018pest ilence and plague\u2019.12 Large -scale epidemics have emerged in China dozens of times since the beginning \nof the first millennium, often occurring in cold and damp years as defined by five -phase philosophy.13 A large \nnumber of Chinese medicine scholars produce d doctrines during or after such disasters that in time became \nfamous. Zhang Zhong jing (150 -129), who suffered the loss of many family members, composed the Shang han \nlun (Treatise on Cold Damage) in which he expounded that cold, wind or damp can invade t he human body, \npenetrating from the yang channels of the outer body inwards the yin channels or organs. He stated that li yi \nis acute and infectious, its symptoms develop much swifter than typical shang han (cold damage), and can \neasily progress to a criti cal - even fatal - stage. It is important for physicians to intervene accurately and rapidly \nin such diseases to reverse the patient\u2019s situation. Prior to the Ming dynasty, most Chinese m e d i c i n e s c h \no l a r s believed li yi to be caused by cold, b ut this idea was challenged by Ming scholars such as Wu Youke \nafter experiencing several epidemics that swept China, such as in 1641. Wu argued that cold only presents in \nwinter, whereas warm epidemics (wen yi \u6e29\u75ab ) can present in all seasons, and that li yi  represents an \nextremely merciless exogenous qi that differs from the usual six exogenous forms of qi. Wu thought any acute \nepidemic disease related to unseasonable warmth, and should be treated with herbal medicine. He \ncondemned some medical professionals  for mistaking epidemic yi qi for shang han and therefore failing in \ntheir duty to adequately treat patients.  \nWarm disease theory was to cause many controversies; for instance, Qing dynasty scholars Ye Lin and Li \nGuanxian thought Wu may have confused his i dea of warm disease with epidemic disease due to the phonetic \nsimilarity of their characters ( \u6e29 warm and \u761f epidemic \u2013 a character that did not exist in ancient \nChinese).15,16 However, \u761f was not only shown as an entry in the Chinese rhyme dictionary Jiyun ( 1037)17 \nbut was also actually specifically identified and annotated by Wu in the chapter on Miscellaneous Qi in his text \nWen yi lun (Treatise on Warm Epidemics).18 This warm versus cold controversy has still not been resolved, \nincluding Wu\u2019s conclusion tha t herbal medicine is the only cure for epidemic disease. Regardless of whether \nor not Wu was correct on this point, the influence of the climate in Wuhan on the recent spread of COVID -19 \ncan be understood using his theory. The Chinese medicine academic Ton g19 as well as many other Chinese \nmedicine scholars believe that the climate in Wuhan in December 2019, with its continuous rain and abnormal \nwarmth, led to the epidemic by fostering cold and damp qi that impairs human yang qi, particularly in the Lung \nand Spleen. The facts on which this understanding is based are: 1. Patients mostly complain of fatigue, poor \nappetite, nausea, vomiting, fullness, diarrhoea or constipation, which points to damp -cold affecting the Spleen  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           90 \n and Lung. 2. Patients\u2019 tongue coatings  are very thick and greasy (described as fu tai \u8150\u82d4 , a tongue coating \nthat looks like rotten bean curd), indicating heavy dampness and turbidity. Tong and his team have drafted a \nfour-stage differentiation and a treatment protocol, as follows: 1. Damp -cold stagnating the Lung; 2. Epidemic \ntoxicity blocking the Lung; 3. Visceral obstruction causing collapse; 4. Lung and Spleen deficiency. \nSubsequently, Wang et al.,20 Ma et al.21 and Chen et al.22,23 have expanded on this general outline with \ndetailed herbal p rescriptions to be tailored to individual patients\u2019 conditions. The primary principles of \ntreatment are to warm yang, disperse cold and eliminate damp. Hubei medical experts characterised the \nCOVID -19 virus as \u2018loving cold and being afraid of warmth\u2019.  \nThe role of acupuncture in treating COVID -19 Somewhat dispiritingly, while scholars have delivered strategies \nfor herbal medicine, acupuncture treatment has received little attention. This article aims to explore the \nfeasibility of acupuncture treatment for CO VID-19-infected patients, and is based on published herbal \nstrategies for this disease as well as Chinese medicine theory. Professor Sun, co -author of this article, has been \npractising Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture in Europe for over 40 years. Th is analysis is based on his \nempirical observations of what is more likely to suit European patients. All Chinese medicine academics \nemphasise that this epidemic is characterised by damp, cold and toxicity, which easily lead to heat and stasis. \nProfessor Su n underlines that the key to treatment is to identify whether the pattern is one of damp -cold toxin \ncausing heat or heat -toxin mixing with damp. In patients with constitutional yang excess, dampcold \naccumulation can quickly turn to damp -heat. In such cases , the treatment principle should be to eliminate \ndampcold whilst simultaneously clearing heat. Heat toxin mixed with damp represents a different scenario; \neven though damp is also present, the root treatment is to clear heat and remove toxin, whilst additi onally \neliminating damp. If the former pattern is mistaken for the latter when treating with herbal medicine, then \ndamp toxin could be aggravated further. In general, the primary treatment principles should be to boost \nStomach and Spleen qi while at the sa me time 1) dispersing cold and scattering damp, 2) eliminating inner \ntoxic qi by venting the exterior, and 3) increasing qi to eliminate turbidity. Epidemic qi attacks the body rapidly \nand violently, therefore clinical features can change dramatically and vary significantly between cases. Severe \nsymptoms can develop within just a few days. The following clinical possibilities should be borne in mind: \u2022 \nOnce damp -cold becomes significant, it can: a) block the Lungs causing dypnoea; b) attack the Pericardium \ncausing chest tension, nausea, cold sweat and shock; c) cause Kidney yang failure, inducing haematuria, \ndehydration, abnormal urination and weight loss; and d) damage the Stomach and Spleen, leading to vomiting \nand diarrhoea. \u2022 Once damp -cold turns to heat , it will occlude the Lungs and yangming (Stomach and Large \nIntestine) resulting in fever, coughing, chest tension and shortness of breath, fatigue, poor appetite, nausea, \nvomiting, bloating, diarrhoea or constipation, eventually destroying the body\u2019s yin and evolving into \nendogenous wind syndrome. How can one avoid contracting such a ferocious epidemic virus? The Nei jing \n(Inner Classic) provides the answer: people with strong zheng (upright) qi will avoid the worst effects of \nepidemic infection despite th e fact that everybody, no matter their age or gender, may be affected.24 Because \neach individual has a different physical constitution, the manifestations of the disease will vary, and so a single \nherbal prescription cannot be universally effective for eve ry patient. Acupuncture is conducted with patients \non a one -to-one basis, and is oriented more to provide symptomatic relief than the generic herbal decoctions \napplied during epidemic periods. The relevant acupuncture protocols, based on the Chinese govern ment four -\nstage differentiation scheme for treating COVID -19, are outlined below.

However, acupuncture is by its very \nnature an individualised therapy. Practitioners must take into consider ation each patient\u2019s individual condition \nand constitution, and tailor the above prescriptions accordingly. It is recommended that practitioners bear in \nmind the following point categories during treatment. Ghost points There are many methods of acupunctur e \npractised globally, each of which has its main focus area, such as musculoskeletal issues or emotional \nproblems.13 Ghost point needling is one method that is relevant in the treatment of epidemics. Before the  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           92 \n 1st century CE, the term yi ( \u75ab) was associate d with ghosts or demons (gui \u9b3c), as in the term yi gui which \nappears in Lunyu (Analects of Confucius) by Confucius (551 \u2013479 BCE), where it is often rendered \u2018hungry ghost\u2019 \nin the English translations of the text.25 Uncontrollable infectious diseases - li yi - were at this time regarded \nas evil qi and associated with ghosts.26 Shaman doctors commonly used the term gui (ghost) as a term for \nunexplained illness and disease. Of course, symptoms of mental illness can be part of the clinical presentation \nduring a cute infectious disease. Ghost points initially appeared in the Shang dynasty (1520 -1030 BCE) and \nwere used for fighting epidemics in the Zhou dynasty (1030 -727 BCE), for example for treating coma during \nthe Warring States Period (475 -221 BCE). These point s were later recommended by Sun Simiao (581 - 682) for \ntreating mental -emotional illness such as madness.27 The concept gui (ghost) should be seen within its \nhistorical context. Throughout most of the Han -Tang period, frequent wars and epidemics resulted in  great \nsocial and economic stress.28 Cao Zhi (192 -232 CE), the prince of the state of Wei expressed his grief for \nfriends who died during an epidemic in 217 CE in Shuo yi qi (Speaking Epidemic Qi), and also described people\u2019s \ndevastation and hopelessness d uring that disaster.8 The \u2018ghost qi\u2019 from unseasonable weather thus not only \ncaused deadly epidemics but also consequent fear. That is, people have more anxiety during epidemic periods \nwhether they become infected or not - which the needling of the ghost p oints can effectively counter. \nUnfortunately, since the systematic development of Chinese medicine in the Han dynasty and the cultural \nrevolutions in the 20th century, medical scholars began to avoid use of practices involving the term \u2018ghost\u2019 in \norder to distant themselves from shamanism.15 Some modern authors believe that ghost points are actually \nrelated to the treatment of yin fire.29  \nObviously, when yin and yang separate, yang floats upwards and outwards; this creates a volatile, unbalanced \nstate, whi ch ferocious epidemic qi can easily take advantage of (and might explain why certain body types are \ninfected more easily than others). However, it is the opinion of the authors of this article that these points can \nstill be valid in the fight against today \u2019s epidemic threat, especially Shaoshang LU -11 and Yinbai SP -1, which \ncan be applied throughout the whole treatment period of COVID19. They are both jing -well points and are \nlocated at the end of the Lung and the beginning of the Spleen channels (the major  organs primarily attacked \nby COVID -19). Their functions are as follows:  \n\u2022 Shaoshang (Lesser Shang, also known as Gui Xin, Ghost Trust) LU -11: Clears the Lung and purges fire, expels \nevil, treats cough and dyspnoea due to exogenous pathogenic qi occluding  the Lung, as well as sore and \nswollen throat, nasal congestion and epistaxis.  \n\u2022 Yinbai (Hidden White, also known as Gui Lei or Ghost Fortress) SP -1: The Zhenjiu Jiayi jing (Systematic Classic \nof Acupuncture & Moxibustion) recommends this point for treati ng dyspnoea, asthma, abdominal distension, \nheat and fullness in the chest, violent diarrhoea, dyspnoea when lying supine, cold feet, epigastric glomus, \nnausea and vomiting, and poor appetite. Confluent points The confluent points of the Extraordinary Vesse ls \nare located in the limbs and can be exceptionally effective for opening the channels and easing body tension. \nHowever, they should be treated in a strict order.30 The upper burner organs are the first targeted and \nobstructed by epidemic qi, followed by the middle burner and finally the lower burner. Therefore for acute \ninfection by COVID -19, opening up the blockage in the upper burner should be the first priority. The actions \nof these points can be summarised as follows:  \n\u2022 Lieque LU -7 and Zhaohai KID -6: regulate qi and blood in the chest, thorax and upper abdomen, and balance \nthe Ren Mai (Conception Vessel) and Yin Qiao Mai (Yin Motility Vessel)  \n\u2022 Neiguan P -6 and Gongsun SP -4: regulate abdominal qi and blood, and balance the Chong Mai (Penetrating \nVessel ) and the Yin Wei Mai (Yin Linking Vessel)  \n\u2022 Waiguan SJ -5 and Zulinqi GB -41: Release exterior tension and clear heat from the Liver and Gall Bladder, \nharmonise Yang wei mai (Yang Linking Vessel) the Dai Mai (Girdle Vessel) and Shao Yang channel collateral s. \n \nConclusion  \nThis is a public domain data -based exploratory study which has limitations in terms of having no empirical \nevidence. Despite this, it is based on review and analysis of extensive documentation. As currently there is no \ncure for or vaccinati on to prevent COVID -19, exploring possible therapies to contribute to this recent global  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           93 \n health crisis could prove vital. While results from Chinese herbal treatment in this area have been encouraging, \nthey have involved unintended consequences, such as di sturbing patients\u2019 Stomach and Spleen function. \nHistorically, acupuncture has been used effectively to treat epidemic infectious diseases, and despite historical \nneglect, it could become a crucial weapon in the battle against COVID -19 and other future epid emics. Of \ncourse, practitioners should ensure that they are properly protected when working with infected patients, \nwhich means wearing a protective suit and administering acupuncture in a hospital environment (which brings \nits own challenges). Inspiring e vidence of the role of acupuncture has been appearing since the beginning of \nMarch 2020. Professor Zou Xu is a critical care medical expert from Guangdong TCM hospital. As one of the \nsupporting medical staff in Wuhan Leishenshan hospital, he always takes a cupuncture needles during his ward \ninspections to help COVID -19 infected patients, especially those with acute symptoms such as shortness of \nbreath, coughing, dizziness, insomnia, restlessness, palpitations, diarrhoea or vomiting. The effect of his \nacupunc ture was often instantaneous. A 72 year old female patient with high blood pressure and diabetic \nchronic illness complained of a lower back ache, whereupon Zou needled the point Taixi KID -3 and the patient \nwas able to stand upright immediately. Zou explain s that acupuncture can improve the patients\u2019 oxygen supply \nand consumption, helping them regain yuan -original qi while blocking the toxicity attacking the Lung. Most \nimportantly, acupuncture is not aiming to destroy the epidemic qi, but instead it can infl uence the conditions \nof its survival in the body.31 Zou\u2019s team was in charge of 16 patients, of which six patients volunteered for \nChinese medicine treatment alone; as of 1st March 2020, all six have fully recovered and have been discharged \nfrom hospital.3 2 In another \u2018Report from the Front Line in Wuhan\u2019, Professor Liu Li Hong has also documented \nthe work of his team treating patients with COVID -19 in Wuhan, emphasising the importance of acupuncture \nin helping patients immediately with symptoms such as stu ffiness in the chest, shortness of breath, abdominal \ndiscomfort, itchy throat, cough, dizziness, pain and sweating.33 Acknowledgements Wen Sheng Zhou gives \nthanks to M.

No effective antiviral treatment has been verified thus far. We report here the clinical characteristics \nand therapeutic procedure for four patients with mild or severe 2019 -nCoV pneumonia admitted to Shanghai \nPublic Health Clinical Cente r. All the patients were given antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir \n(Kaletra\u00ae), arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC, a traditional Chinese medicine) and other necessary \nsupport care. After treatment, three patients gained significant imp rovement in pneumonia associated \nsymptoms, two of whom were confirmed 2019 -nCoV negative and discharged, and one of whom was virus \nnegative at the first test. The remaining patient with severe pneumonia had shown signs of improvement by \nthe cutoff date for  data collection. Results obtained in the current study may provide clues for treatment of \n2019 -nCoV pneumonia. The efficacy of antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and SFJDC \nwarrants further verification in future study.  \nKeywords 20 19-nCoV, lopinavir, ritonavir, arbidol, Shufeng Jiedu Capsule  \n1. Introduction  \nCoronaviruses mainly cause respiratory tract infections and some strains have high infectivity and mortality as \nwell as heavy damage on public health, such as severe acute respir atory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East \nrespiratory syndrome (MERS) (1). A pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 - nCoV) \nemerged in Wuhan, China in December, 2019 and has spread rapidly, with 24,324 confirmed cases in mainland \nChina as of  February 4, 2020 (2,3). The most common clinical presentation is fever, fatigue, and dry cough and \nsome patients present with nasal congestion, runny nose, and diarrhea (4). In severe cases, dyspnea usually \noccurs one week after the disease onset and some  patients can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome (ARDS), septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, and coagulation disorders (4). Thus far, there is \nno approved or verified effective drugs specific to the virus (5). We report here t hat four patients with mild or \nsevere 2019 -nCoV pneumonia have been cured or have significant improvement in their respiratory symptoms \nafter treatment with combined lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra\u00ae), arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC, a \ntraditional C hinese medicine) on the base of supportive care.  \n2. Methods  \n2.1. Patients  \nFor this retrospective study, four patients were recruited from January 21 to January 24, 2020 at Shanghai \nPublic Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, China, which is a designated hosp ital for 2019 -nCoV pneumonia. All \npatients were diagnosed as having 2019 -nCoV pneumonia according to WHO interim guidance. Informed \nconsent to therapeutic regimen was obtained from each patient prior to treatment.  \n2.2. Data collection  \nEpidemiological, demo graphic, clinical, laboratory, management, and outcome data were collected through a \nreview of medical records. Clinical outcomes were followed up until February 4, 2020. Laboratory confirmation \nof 2019 -CoV was done in Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease  Control and Prevention. Throat -swab \nspecimens from the upper respiratory tract that were obtained from all patients at admission were maintained \nin viral -transport medium. 2019 - nCoV was confirmed by real -time RT -PCR using the same protocol described \nprev iously (6). All patients were given chest computed tomography (CT) or chest radiography.   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           96 \n 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Demographics and baseline characteristics  \nFour patients with 2019 -nCoV are included in this study, two of whom are under the age of 35 a nd the other \ntwo are over the age of 60 (Table 1). All the patients had epidemiologic linkage to areas with community \ntransmission of 2019 -nCoV. Among them, two patients (Case 1 and 4) had recent travel history to Wuhan, one \npatient (case 2) is a student w ho was ordinarily a resident in Wuhan and went back to  \nShanghai for winter holiday, and one patient (Case 3) is the husband of a confirmed 2019 -nCoV case. It took \n11 and 6 days from disease onset to confirmed diagnosis for case 1 and case 2, while 1 and 2 days for case 3 \nand case 4. Fatty liver was reported in the case 1. No underlying medical conditions were reported in the other \nthree cases.  \n3.2. Clinical characteristics and laboratory assessment  \nOn admission, the most common symptoms were fever or history of fever, followed by cough, fatigue, \ndizziness, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea (Table 2). Diarrhea was not observed in all patients, on the \ncontrary, two of them were reported to have constipation. Physical examination revealed increased \nrespira tory rate in three patients, one of whom had tachypnea (26/min). Lung auscultation revealed rhonchi \nin left or right lower lobe in three patients. In all patients, there were marked abnormalities on chest \nradiography; involvement of both lungs was found by  chest computerized tomography (CT) in 2 patients at \npresentation. Ground -glass opacities and consolidation were the most common radiologic findings. On \nadmission, leucocytes were in the normal range in all the patients (Table 3). One patient (case 4) had \nneutrophils above the normal range, indicating the existence of concurrent bacterial infection. Lymphocytes \nwere below the normal range in one patient (case 4) and within the normal range in other three patients. \nBlood gas analysis revealed that oxygen pre ssure was below the normal range in two patients (7.60 kPa in case \n3 and 5.45 kPa in case 4) (Table 3). On the basis of the above results, two patients (case 1 and 2) were \ndiagnosed with mild pneumonia and the other two patients (case 3 and 4) with severe pneumonia  \n \n \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           97 \n   \nFigure 1. Chest CTs of patient 1 obtained on January 21 (A) and January 29 (B), 2020  \n3.3. Treatment and clinical outcomes  \nAll patients received antiviral treatment, including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra \u00ae, lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 \nmg, q12h, po), arbidol (0.2 g, tid, po), and SFJDC (2.08 g, tid, po). The duration of antiviral treatment was 6 -15 \ndays. In addition, all patients were all given antibiotic treatment and started on supplemental oxygen, \ndelivered by nasal cannula after admission to hospital (Table 2).  \nPatient 1 was admitted to hospital on January 21, 2020 and thereafter received the above treatment. On \nJanuary 27, routine blood analysis revealed that leucocytes and lymphocytes were increased , indicating \nrecovery and restoration of immune function (Table 3). On January 29, chest CT demonstrated bilateral \npneumonia with scattered multiple nodules, which was obviously improved compared with that obtained on \nJanuary 21 (Figure 1). 2019 -nCoV was t wice negative in throat -swab specimens from the upper respiratory \ntract. The patient was free of fever, productive cough, dyspnea, short breath, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, \nand thus discharged on January 29, 2020. Patient 2 was admitted to hospital on Ja nuary 24, 2020 and then \nreceived the above mentioned treatment. On January 28, routine blood analysis showed increased count of \nleucocytes and lymphocytes (Table 3). Blood gas analysis revealed no obvious abnormity. On January 29, chest \nCT revealed unilate ral pneumonia in the left lobe, which was mildly improved compared with the images \nobtained on January 24 (Figure 2). Results of two continuous 2019 -nCoV tests were negative for throat -swab \nspecimens. Symptoms associated with pneumonia had improved and the  patient was discharged on January \n30, 2020.  \nPatient 3 was admitted to hospital on January 24, 2020 and thereafter received the above mentioned \ntreatment. The fever disappeared after one day of treatment. On January 29, chest CT showed progressed \npneumonia  in the right lobe (Figure 3). The treatment was continuous and the pneumonia appearance \nimproved on February 1 as reflected by the CTimage (Figure 3). On February 3, blood gas analysis \ndemonstrated obviously increased oxygen pressure compared with that at  admission. The patient had mild \ncough with white phlegm, and was free of fever, dyspnea, short breath, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. 2019 -\nnCoV test result was negative for the first time on February 4, 2020. The patient remained in hospital for the \nsecond  virus test.  \nPatient 4 was admitted to hospital on January 22, 2020. In addition to the above mentioned treatments, the \npatient was also given human seroalbumin and \u03b3-immunoglobulin. On January 31, the patient was given an \nintubated ventilator -assisted bre athing therapy because of refractory low blood oxygen pressure. Routine \nblood analysis on February 1 demonstrated the percentages of neutrophils and lymphocytes were 94% and \n3.2%, respectively, which were comparable with those at admission (Table 3).  \n \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           98 \n  \nChest radiography demonstrated bilateral pneumonia, which improved compared to the image obtained on \nJanuary 31 (Figure 4). Chest radiograph on February 2 revealed further mild improvement. On February 3, \nbilateral pneumonia remained but the appearances o f left lobe improved and right lobe mildly worsened. On \nFebruary 5, the appearance of pneumonia improved compared with the last image (Figure 4). The patient was \nstill using ventilators at data cutoff.  \nWe report here the clinical characteristics and therap eutic procedure for four patients with 2019 - CoV \npneumonia receiving comprehensive therapy. The antivirus treatment regimen includes lopinavir/ritonavir \n(Kaletra\u00ae), arbidol, and SFJDC. By February 4, 2020, two patients were confirmed 2019 -nCoV negative and  one \npatient was virus -negative at the first test. Lopinavir/ ritonavir (Kaletra\u00ae) is a human immunodeficiency virus \n(HIV) medicine used in combination with other medicines to treat adults and children over 14 days of age who \nare infected with HIV -1 (7). I t was revealed that lopinavir/ritonavir among SARS -CoV patients was associated \nwith substantial clinical benefit (fewer adverse clinical outcomes) (8). The combination of lopinavir and \nritonavir is currently a recommended antivirus regimen in the latest ve rsion of Diagnosis and Treatment of \nPneumonia Caused by 2019 -nCoV (version 5) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic \nof China (4). Arbidol is an antiviral treatment for influenza infection used in Russia and China (9). It was claimed  \nthat arbidol was effective against 2019 -nCoV at a concentration range of 10 -30 \u03bcM in vitro (10). A randomized \nmulticenter controlled clinical trial of arbidol in patients with 2019 -nCoV (ChiCTR2000029573) has been \ninitiated in China (11). SFJDC is a tradi tional Chinese medicine for treatment of influenza in China. This drug is \nalso recommended for treating 2019 -nCoV infection in the latest version of Diagnosis and Treatment of \nPneumonia Caused by 2019 -nCoV (version 5) (4).  \nIn conclusion, two mild and two s evere 2019 - nCoV pneumonia patients were given combined Chinese and \nWestern medicine treatment, three of whom gained significant improvement in pneumonia associated \nassociated symptoms. The remaining patient with severe pneumonia has shown signs of improve ment by the \ncutoff date for data collection. The efficacy of antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and \nSFJDC warrants further verification in future study.  \nAcknowledgements  \nThe study is supported by Shanghai Municipal Key Clinical Sp ecialty (shslczdzk05101) and Shanghai Key Clinical Laboratory of Internal \nMedicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine (14DZ2273200).  \nReferences  \n1.

Tiene como eje la respuesta inflamatoria que es causada \nen la mayor\u00eda de las veces por enfer - medades infecto -contagiosas de la Medicina Moderna. Wen Bing ( \u761f\u75c5 ) \nes un subtipo de la enfermedad anteriormente mencionada. Posee capacidad infecto -contagiosa , y puede dar \nmuerte a grupos de personas con disminuci\u00f3n de la inmunidad tales como ancianos, lactantes e infantes. Yi \nBing (\u75ab\u75c5 ) se refiere a Wen Bing pero con marcada letalidad y puede provocar la muerte incluso adultos \nj\u00f3venes sanos. Li Bing ( \u75a0\u75c5 ) se ref iere a Yi Bing con mayor infectividad y letalidad a\u00fan.  \nSin importar si el estado inmune de los contactos cercanos sea alto o bajo, son propensos de contraer la \nenfermedad. Los que debutan en la fase cr\u00edtica, tiene alta mortalidad a corto plazo, en cuesti\u00f3n  de minutos, \nhoras o d\u00edas. Por estas razones, esto ha causado la extinci\u00f3n de familias completas y hasta pueblos enteros en \nla antig\u00fcedad. El Wen Bing que trata esta gu\u00eda engloba al Wen Bing, Yi Bing y Li Bing.  \nSugiero al Estado que publique documentos rel acionados al mismo, as\u00ed como elaborar un nomenclador de \ngu\u00eda de conceptos de Wen Bing, Yi Bing y Li Bing desde MTC. (Consultar el nomenclador de las de \nenfermedades infecto -con- tagiosas, categor\u00eda A, B y C de la medicina moderna). W\u00e9n Bing se divide en do s \ncategor\u00edas: Enfermedad por Calor intenso y Enfermedad por Humedad -Calor. La Enfermedad por Calor intenso \nse carac - teriza anatomo -patol\u00f3gicamente por una inflamaci\u00f3n de tipo alterativa, donde predomina el da\u00f1o \ntisular y la necrosis celular. En cambio, la  inflama - ci\u00f3n en la Enfermedad por Humedad -Calor es de \u00edndole \nexudativa donde pre - valece el edema y la exudaci\u00f3n tisular que evoluciona en la mayor\u00eda de los casos hacia \nla fibrosis. La Enfermedad Taiyin incluye a las enfermedades del Taiyin Bazo (tracto digestivo) y del Taiyin \nPulm\u00f3n (v\u00edas respiratorias). El Wen Bing del S\u00edndrome de Humedad -Calor de Taiyin Pulmonar (incluye los Yi \nBing y Li Bing) abarca m\u00faltiples tipos de enfermedades infecciosas pulmonares, tales como: Leptos - pirosis \nHemorr\u00e1gica Pulmona r, Peste Neum\u00f3nica y Neumon\u00eda por Coronavirus, etc. Esta gu\u00eda trata principalmente la \nNeumon\u00eda por Coronavirus, explicando y debatiendo detalladamente a cerca de la prevenci\u00f3n y el tratamiento \ndel Wen Bing del S\u00edndrome de Humedad -Calor de Taiyin Pulmonar.  \nEn esta enfermedad es necesario tomar en cuenta las caracter\u00edsticas de la localizaci\u00f3n de la afecci\u00f3n por la \nHumedad pat\u00f3gena: \u2460 Si la Humedad -Calor no reside en el Bazo -Est\u00f3mago, reside en H\u00edgado -Ves\u00edcula Biliar. \nEsto se debe a que el Bazo es el origen de  la Humedad. Los que sufren de Insuficiencia de Bazo, les es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil \nsufrir la Humedad por afecci\u00f3n interna y externa. Shaoyang -Sanjiao es la ruta de humores que par - ticipa en \nel metabolismo del agua y de los humores, a su vez, \u201cEl Qi del Fuego trata la s enfermedades en Shaoyang\u201d, \nesto facilita la g\u00e9nesis de Calor por Represi\u00f3n de Humedad o la afecci\u00f3n directa del Calor Pat\u00f3geno. Por estas \nrazones, en el tratamiento de dicha enfermedad hace hincapi\u00e9 en el Taiyin y Shaoyang. Cl\u00ednicamente, es \nfrecuente la lesi\u00f3n hep\u00e1tica; la fiebre se acom - pa\u00f1a de astenia (el H\u00edgado es la base de la resistencia a la \nfatiga) y, el rechazo a las grasas, s\u00edntomas caracter\u00edsticos de la lesi\u00f3n en Shaoyang. Otros s\u00edntomas a tomar en \ncuenta son: sensaci\u00f3n de gusto amargo en la bo ca, molestias en la garganta, ojo rojo, pulso de cuerda e \nhinchaz\u00f3n de los bordes de la lengua. \u2461 La Humedad Pat\u00f3gena impregna Sanjiao, difundi\u00e9ndose hacia arriba \ny hacia abajo; hacia arriba se presenta con tos; hacia el medio con diarrea, n\u00e1useas, v\u00f3mitos  y distensi\u00f3n \nabdominal; hacia abajo, dificultad para orinar e injuria renal. \u2462 La Humedad -Calor puede presentar tanto \nmanifestaciones externas como internas. Por afuera, es frecuente el rush cut\u00e1neo y por adentro, da\u00f1o \nmioc\u00e1rdico que en casos severos llev a al shock y al coma. \u2463 Si hay Exceso, es Yangming; si hay Insuficiencia, \nes Taiyin. Por ende, Yangming predomina Calor sobre Humedad, y Taiyin viceversa.  \nClaves en las indicaciones m\u00e9dicas: \u2460 El calor no se libera mediante diaforesis. Luego de que el paci ente \ntranspira, baja la fiebre y sienta mejor\u00eda cl\u00ednica, con o sin tratamiento, no significa que la enfermedad se haya \naliviado. Sin embargo, muchos pacientes presentan fiebre alternante con intervalos de mejor\u00eda que se \ncaracterizan por la incapacidad de r ecuperar la normalidad del pulso (pulso tranquilo), de la temperatura \ncorporal (frialdad) y de la saburra lingual. \u2461 Los que sufren Calor Ondulante en horario fijo (Ej: muchos lo \nhacen por la tarde), pueden recibir una dosis de medicaci\u00f3n treinta minutos a  una hora previo al pr\u00f3ximo \nevento (Ej: Los que sufren de Calor intenso luego de las 13:00 horas, adicionar una dosis extra de Yin Chai Xiao \nDu Dan, ya que el Calor se encuentra en Yangming; por otro lado, los que lo hacen antes de las 13:00 horas o  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           101 \n inclus ive antes de las 11:00 horas, hay m\u00e1s posibilidad de rece - tar Chai Ling Tang, puesto que el Calor se \nencuentra casi siempre en Taiyang. \u2462 A los m\u00e1s graves se les puede indicar una dosis cada 4 horas, mientras \nque a los cr\u00edticos, cada 3 horas. Tener especi al cuidado con el Bazo y el Est\u00f3 - mago. \u2463 El curso de la \nenfermedad en los pacientes leves es aproximadamente de 14 d\u00edas. No obstante, pese a la mejor\u00eda cl\u00ednica \n\u00edntegra luego de unos d\u00edas de tratamiento, se recomienda completar los 14 d\u00edas de tratamiento.  \n1. Fase temprana  \n1.1Clasificaci\u00f3n de fases y tipos  \nEsta fase se encuentra m\u00e1s frecuente en:  \n\u2460 Fase temprana de la enfermedad: Tener en cuenta que la fase temprana y la fase intermedia no dependen \nde manera determinante al tiempo de evoluci\u00f3n de la enferm edad. Muchos pacientes permanecen en esta \nfase (los leves), otros debutan en fase intermedia (los moderados), y algunos fa - llecen de manera r\u00e1pida (los \ncr\u00edticos).  \n\u2461 Paciente con marcada Insuficiencia del Bazo, que presenta mayor Humedad que Calor: Al momento de la \nexaminaci\u00f3n, se debe prestar mucha atenci\u00f3n en la parte media y basal de la lengua ya que si se encuentra \np\u00e1lida, indica Insuficiencia del Bazo o del Yang.  Cuando la fiebre no es muy alta o despu\u00e9s del descenso de la \ntemperatura con medicaci\u00f3n, se puede explorar los dedos de los pies para valorar si hay Insuficiencia del Yang, \ndebido a que los que sufren Insuficiencia del Yang severo, los dedos de sus pies p ermanecen fr\u00edos aun cuando \nest\u00e9n cursando una fiebre. Las improntas dentales en losbordes de la lengua indican tambi\u00e9n Insuficiencia del \nBazo, y hay que dife - renciarlo de la hinchaz\u00f3n lingual lateral (fen\u00f3meno de represi\u00f3n de Qi del h\u00edgado). \nCuando \u00e9sta \u00fa ltima es dif\u00edcil de apreciar, inspeccionar las improntas dentales en la cara interna de las mejillas.  \n\u2462 Pacientes leves: Hay que prestar especial atenci\u00f3n porque a veces existe una disociaci\u00f3n de la cl\u00ednica con \nel curso de la enfermedad. Es decir, que sea  leve o no, no depende meramente de la presentaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica, sino \nque es necesario una evaluaci\u00f3n completa semiol\u00f3gica de lengua y pulso, con o sin m\u00e9todos diagn\u00f3sticos \ncomplementarios contempor\u00e1neos como radiograf\u00eda de t\u00f3rax o tomograf\u00eda computada.  \nLa fas e temprana muchas veces es diagnosticada de manera err\u00f3nea como S\u00edndrome Fr\u00edo -Humedad debido a \nlas siguientes causas:  \n \u2460 La Insuficiencia del Bazo produce Humedad interna, y por afecci\u00f3n interna externa, se torna m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil \ncontraer Pat\u00f3geno Externo. Estos pacientes presentan a menudo lengua p\u00e1lida con improntas dentales.  \n\u2461 Mientras m\u00e1s Humedad haya, m\u00e1s saburra blanca se produce, y a veces oculta toda la lengua roja; otras \nveces se ignora el enrojecimiento del dorso lingual generado por represi\u00f3n del Calor . \u2462 En el comienzo de la \ntransformaci\u00f3n en Calor, se puede observar una capa fina de saburra amarilla por encima de la blanca muchas \nveces desaper - cibida. Es imprescindible interrogar sobre la materia fecal. La saburra ama - rrilla de los \nestre\u00f1idos desapa recer\u00e1 una vez que se evacu\u00e9; por otro lado, la saburra amarilla es producida por la \nrespuesta inflamatoria y confirma la transformaci\u00f3n en Calor.  \n\u2463 La saburra de los inmunosuprimidos  no se convertir\u00e1 en amarilla a pesar de la transformaci\u00f3n en Calor.  \n\u2464 La respuesta inflamatoria necesita entre horas a uno o dos d\u00edas para que los leucocitos se conviertan en \npiocitos. Por eso, los pacientes con Enfer - medad Calor intenso muestran saburr a blanca y seca en la fase \ntemprana. Se puede precisar la saburra granulada en la inspecci\u00f3n detallada pese a que la Humedad pueda \nencubrir la Sequedad.  \n\u2465 Otro punto para recalcar del S\u00edndrome Fr\u00edo -H\u00famedad es la presenciadel pulso moderado en ausencia de \nfiebre, a diferencia de un pulso basal le - vemente m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido en el S\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor. Por estas \nrazones, no se debe diagnosticar como Fr\u00edo -H\u00famedad.   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           102 \n \u2466 Algunos pacientes aparentan lengua p\u00e1lida con saburra blanca y grasienta. Empero, una vez que recib en \nmedicaci\u00f3n del Calor, se vuelven con el pulso taquisf\u00edgmico y saburra amarillenta, coincidente con el \nmecanismo de expansi\u00f3n de Humedad -Calor del Wen Bing de Humedad -Calor. En cambio, esta transformaci\u00f3n \nno ocurre en el S\u00edndrome Fr\u00edo -Humedad, un ejemplo  de lo \u00faltimo es Li Zhong Tang para el S\u00edndrome Fr\u00edo -\nHumedad por C\u00f3lera  \n\u2467 Debido a la presencia de una noxa clara y determinada en Wen Bing, no se sostiene la hip\u00f3tesis de que una \nparte de esta enfermedad sea producida por Humedad -Calor y otra por Fr\u00edo -Hum edad. La Humedad es un \npat\u00f3geno Yin y el Calor, un pat\u00f3geno Yang. Contemplando la variabilidad de la consti - tuci\u00f3n f\u00edsica, sea m\u00e1s \nfr\u00edo o m\u00e1s calor, se produce diferentes tipos de mani - festaciones cl\u00ednicas. Sin embargo, esto no influye en el \ndiagn\u00f3stico del S\u00edn - drome Humedad -Calor de esta enfermedad. Por lo tanto, solo hay que ajustar las f\u00f3rmulas \nseg\u00fan la variabilidad de la constituci\u00f3n f\u00edsica y el nivel de Hume - dad o Calor.  \nOtros tantos presentan tos seca o con escasa flema, que pueden llevar a un err or diagn\u00f3stico de Insuficiencia \ndel Yin. La escasa flema se debe a dif\u00edcil expectoraci\u00f3n por su localizaci\u00f3n en el intersticio alv\u00e9olo pulmonar, \ndiferente de la bronquitis y de la bronquiolitis. Por este motivo, no se puede diagnosti - car como Insuficienci a \ndel Yin o ausencia de la Humedad por la escasa flema.  \n1.2 Tratamiento  \n1.2.1 Elaboraci\u00f3n de la f\u00f3rmula  \nF\u00f3rmula de Wu Men, Chai Ling Tang modificada. Ingredientes: Chai Hu 24g, Huang Qin 9g, Gui Zhi 6 -9g, Bai \nZhu 9g, Fu Ling 10g, Zhu Ling 10g, Ze Xie 9g, Sheng Gan Cao 6g, Shi Shang Bo 30g, Lian Qiao 30g.  \n1.2.2 Explicaci\u00f3n de la f\u00f3rmula  \nEn el \u00a8Shang Han Lun\u00a8 est\u00e1 documentado el uso de la f\u00f3rmula Wu Ling San para el tratamiento de v\u00f3mito, \ndiarrea, tos y fiebre por afecci\u00f3n externa; y Xiao Chai Hu Tang para  el Calor por afecci\u00f3n externa. Sanjiao es la \nruta de los humores, Xiao Chai Hu Tang tambi\u00e9n se indica para la tonificaci\u00f3n de los movimientos de los \nl\u00edquidos corporales, as\u00ed como se dice: \u00a8Si el Jiao superior (Shangjiao) se desbloquea, los l\u00edquidos y los humores \nbajan, entonces, el Qi del est\u00f3mago se armoniza y el Calor se libera por sudoraci\u00f3n lluviosa.\u00a8 [3] Shi Shang Bo \nse usa para la infecci\u00f3n pulmonar y Sheng Gan Cao para la desinto - xicaci\u00f3n ya que el \u00e1cido glicirret\u00ednico (\u00e1cido \nde Gan Cao) tiene prop iedades antiinflamatorias similares a los glucocorticoides. En \u00a8Jing Yue Quan Shu\u00a8 \n(Obras completas de Jing Yue) est\u00e1 registrado que al Wu Ling San hay que agregarle Qiang Huo para la afecci\u00f3n \nexterna por Fr\u00edo -Humedad; mientras que en mi experiencia es adi cionar Lian Qiao cuando la afecci\u00f3n externa \nfuera por Humedad -Calor. Lian Qiao tiene funciones antiem\u00e9ticas (como Gan Lu Xiao Du Dan), refresca la \nsangre (como Qing Ying Tang), depura el coraz\u00f3n (como Qing Gong Tang), depura el h\u00edgado (como Ma Huang \nLian Q iao Chi Xiao Dou Tang) adem\u00e1s de liberar la superficie. Puesto que la fisiopatolog\u00eda de Shaoyang es lucha \nentre lo recto y lo perverso, los que sufren de modo cr\u00edtico el S\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor evoluciona casi \nsiempre con falla hep\u00e1tica fulmi - nante. Asimis mo, es frecuente que Wen Bing afecta directamente a la capa \nnutricia ( \u71df) y a la capa sangu\u00ednea ( \u8840) por lo que se ve en la fase temprana una lengua espiculada. \nContemplando todos los factores mencionados ante - riormente, hay que dar m\u00e1s dosis de Lian Qiao. Hay que \ntener mucho cuidado con el uso de medicamentos que refuerzan la Energ\u00eda Recta, como Huan Qi o Ren Shen, \nya que \u00e9stos pueden exacerbar la respuesta inflamatoria. Por esta raz\u00f3n, se quita Ren Shen del Xiao Chai Hu \nTang. Para los individuos con comple xi\u00f3n d\u00e9bil, se puede aumentar la dosis de Sheng Gan Cao hasta 9 -15g e \nincluso a\u00f1adir Tai Zhi Shen 15 -50g. Cabe destacar, hay que controlar la tensi\u00f3n de lucha entre el Qi recto y el \nQi per - verso. Se necesita Ren Shen y Huan Qi para eliminar definitivament e la causa patog\u00e9nica de la infecci\u00f3n \ncitol\u00edtica en individuos con Insuficiencia del Bazo. Sin embargo, no es \u00e9sta la fisiopatolog\u00eda de esta enfermedad. \nCuando existe una alteraci\u00f3n inmunol\u00f3gica, el tratamiento alop\u00e1tico son los antiinflamato - rios anticit oquinas. \nEmpero, el uso de Ren Shen y Huan Qi en MTC refuerza la respuesta inmune, por lo cual se debe indicar con \nmucha precauci\u00f3n. No se recomienda su uso si no fueran expertos tanto en W\u00e9n Bing Xue de MTC como en \nInfectolog\u00eda de medicina alop\u00e1tica. Se r ecomienda sumar Zhi Ban Xia 9g y una cucharada de jugo de Jengibre  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           103 \n para enfermos con marcada hiperemesis y diarrea. El jugo de Jengibre facilita la transformaci\u00f3n de la Humedad \ny no genera Calor, por lo que su uso es relativamente mayor que Sheng Jiang en W\u00e9n Bing. Por este motivo, \nel Jugo de Jengibre sustituye a Sheng Jiang en Xiao Chai Hu Tang. Se recomienda incorporar Dang Gui 9g en \npacientes con evidente Insuficiencia de sangre o en las mujeres durante el per\u00edodo menstrual. En los pacientes \ncon Humedad intensa, se descarta Da Zhao de Xiao Chai Hu Tang por su nutrici\u00f3n grasienta, y se prefiere al \nDang Gui que tiene acci\u00f3n antiinflama - toria espec\u00edfica en capa sangu\u00ednea ( \u8840\u5206 ) adem\u00e1s de vigorizar y nutrir \nla sangre.  \nSe recomienda asociar Ge Gen 30g (m\u00e9todo G e Gen Qin Lian Tang) a los pacientes con diarrea abundante o \npresentan tez colorada destacable. Se recomienda agregar Cao Guo 3 -6g (m\u00e9todo Da Yuan Yin) si presenta \nsaburra blanca, gruesa y s\u00edmil polvo. Cao Guo es medicamento especial para saburra blanca y gruesa \n(engrosamiento de papilas filiformes). Agregar Hou Pu en caso de distensi\u00f3n abdominal o Bing Lang (debe \ntener materia fecal s\u00f3lida) para los m\u00e1s severos.  \n1.3 Evoluci\u00f3n La evoluci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica habitual es la transformaci\u00f3n en Calor por Represi\u00f3n de la H umedad, que se \nasemeja al concepto del s\u00edndrome de respuesta infla - matoria sist\u00e9mica (SIRS) o de sobreinfecci\u00f3n bacteriana \nen la medicina occi - dental moderna. A continuaci\u00f3n se detallan algunos m\u00e9todos para determinar si la \nHumedad Pat\u00f3gena se ha transfo rmado en Calor: El primero es ver si sobre la saburra blanca existe otra capa \namarilla. El segundo es examinar la presencia o no de enrojecimiento lingual o gloquidios en el dorso de la \nlengua. El tercero es palpar el pulso. El pulso impetuoso ( \u8e81\u8108  Zao Mai)  indica transformaci\u00f3n en Calor, pero \n\u00e9ste no solo se limita a la frecuencia de pulsos por minuto. Los principiantes pueden contar la frecuencia \nteniendo en cuenta lo siguiente: la frecuencia basal del pulso moderado de Insuficiencia del Bazo es de 70 por \nminuto, mientras que la basal de pulso lento de Insuficiencia del Yang es de 60 por minuto. Entonces, palpar \nel pulso es una manera de evaluar la temperatura corporal ya que por cada aumento de 1 \u2103, la frecuencia de \npulso aumenta 10 por minuto. De esta mane ra, se puede estimar el nivel de transformaci \u00f3n en Calor o si existe \nCalor interno seg \u00fan la relaci \u00f3n entre la temperatura corporal y la frecuencia de pulso. El cuarto es verificar si \nhay sobreinfecci\u00f3n bacteriana. Cl\u00ednicamente es com\u00fan encontrar dolor de g arganta, inflamaci\u00f3n o supuraci\u00f3n \namigdalina o aumento de leucocitos a predominio de neutr\u00f3filos absolutos en el an\u00e1lisis de sangre. Como esta \nenfermedad genera linfopenia, el aumento porcentual re - lativo de neutr\u00f3filos no implica infecci\u00f3n bacteriana. \nSe recomienda quitar Gui Zhi o bajar su dosis a 3 -6g o reemplazarla por Rou Gui cuando es dif\u00edcil determinar \nsi hay transformaci\u00f3n en Calor o no. La f\u00f3rmula de la fase intermedia es m\u00e1s segura mientras que la de fase \ntemprana libera m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido el Calor. Es d ecir, al no poder discernir clara - mente la presencia de transformaci\u00f3n \nen Calor, indicar directamente la f\u00f3r - mula de fase intermedia, especialmente para los principiantes de la MTC. \nAl indicar f\u00f3rmula de fase intermedia en pacientes de fase temprana, que  mu- chas veces sufren de \nInsuficiencia del Bazo constitucional, es importante adi - cionar Chen Pi y/o Cang Zhu para cuidado del Bazo y \nEst\u00f3mago. Hay dos formas de manejo en los pacientes que predomina el Calor: el primero es indicar \ndirectamente la f\u00f3rmul a de la fase intermedia y; el se - gundo es incorporar Shi Gao, Hua Shi y Han Shui Shi \n(M\u00e9todo Gan Lu Yin) sobre la f\u00f3rmula de la fase temprana as\u00ed como sustituir Rou Gui 3g por Gui Zhi en la \ndecocci\u00f3n o Rou Gui 1g v\u00eda oral.  \n2. Fase intermedia  \n2.1 Clasific aci\u00f3n de fases y tipos  \nExisten tres tipos:  \n\u2460 Los individuos con Calor Interno constitucional, debutan directamente en fase intermedia cuando contraen \nesta enfermedad.  \n\u2461 Los pacientes con predominio de Humedad en s\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor son m\u00e1s propensos a  desarrollar \nla Transformaci\u00f3n en Calor por Represi\u00f3n de Humedad.   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           104 \n \u2462 Pacientes tipo moderado. Hay que prestar especial atenci\u00f3n porque amenudo existe una disociaci\u00f3n de la \nmejor\u00eda cl\u00ednica con la progresi\u00f3n de la enfermedad. Es decir, que sea moderado o no,  no depende meramente \nde la presentaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica, sino que es necesario una evaluaci\u00f3n semiol\u00f3gica com - pleta de lengua y pulso, con \no sin m\u00e9todos diagn\u00f3sticos complementarios con - tempor\u00e1neos como radiograf\u00eda de t\u00f3rax o tomograf\u00eda \ncomputada.  \nSe debe prest ar atenci\u00f3n al pulso en casos de Wen Bin sin Calor:  \n\u2460 La presencia de Calor. Se revela con el pulso impetuoso. En caso de no dominar la semiolog\u00eda de pulso, \ncontar la frecuencia diariamente. Ante la ausencia de Calor con aumento de pulsos por minuto, se d ebe prestar \natenci\u00f3n a la aparici\u00f3n de fiebre alta s\u00fabita, semejando al estado previo del SIRS. En el texto original de \u00a8Shang \nHan Lun\u00a8 menciona el t\u00e9rmino fiebre alta s\u00fabita y se diagnostica con el pulso.  \n\u2461 El nivel de Humedad. Se revela de 3 formas: Prim ero, si el pulso es fino. Segundo, si el pulso es moderado. \nPrestar atenci\u00f3n a Yi Bing del Taiyin Bazo, por ejemplo la fiebre tifoidea intestinal, que se ve poco en Yi Bing \ndel Taiyin Pulm\u00f3n Tercero, si el pulso es \u00e1spero y d\u00e9bil. Una manera para los princ ipiantes de MTC es ver si \npueden sentir claramente bajo sus dedos cada pulsaci\u00f3n. De lo contrario puede estar relacionado con la \nHumedad. (El pulso \u00e1spero y d\u00e9bil no solo aparece en enfermedades de Humedad).  \nF\u00edjese que la Humedad es un pat\u00f3geno Yin perver so mientas que el Calor, un pat\u00f3geno Yang perverso. La \nmayor\u00eda de las manifestaciones cl\u00ednicas de la Humedad y del Calor son contrapuestas:  \n\u2460 El pulso del Calor es rebosante, grande y r\u00e1pido; mientras que el de la Humedad es fino, d\u00e9bil y moderado \n(rebosante -d\u00e9bil, grande -fino, moderado -r\u00e1pido), totalmente opuestos. A pesar de que los pulsos se \nenmascaran entre s\u00ed, la presencia de saburra grues a grasienta y amarilla o el dorso de la lengua enrojecida \nindican gravedad igual de Humedad y Calor.  \n\u2461 Los aspectos de la lengua tambi\u00e9n se enmascaran entre s\u00ed. Cuando hay Humedad intensa, se ve lengua \np\u00e1lida e Insuficiencia del Bazo, mientras que en el C alor intenso, lengua roja vinosa. La clave para diferenciar \ndel Calor est\u00e1 en la punta de la lengua y en la saburra. Si hay Calor oculto, ver dorso de la lengua.  \n\u2462 La insuficiencia del Yin tambi\u00e9n se enmascara con la Humedad. El pulso de Humedad -Calor es f ino pero no \nhueco (\u82a4 Kou), ya que la presencia de \u00e9ste indica Insuficiencia del Yin o de sangre. Cuando sufren de s\u00edndrome \nHumedad -Calor, en los individuos con insuficiencia de sangre constitucional, se produce una disminuci\u00f3n \nr\u00e1pida de gl\u00f3bulos rojos, com o ocurre en los casos de glomerulonefritis cr\u00f3nica. Tener en cuenta la \nobservaci\u00f3n de las grietas finas linguales.  \n\u2463 Los gloquidios tambi\u00e9n pueden ser enmascarados por la Insuficiencia del Bazo, particularmente en la punta \nde la lengua. Hay que prestar at enci\u00f3n que los abundantes gloquidios no enrojecidos indican d\u00e9ficit de Qi \nRecto, grupo de pacientes que fallecen f\u00e1cilmente ante infecci\u00f3n citot\u00f3xica por dis - minuci\u00f3n de su inmunidad. \nSin embargo, ante una infecci\u00f3n viral no citot\u00f3 - xica (s\u00ed citol\u00edtica) s e desencadeuna un da\u00f1o inmunitario \ninflamatorio, que por la respuesta inmune deficiente, raras veces genera muerte s\u00fabita. Empero, facilita la \npersistencia de la enfermedad, que puede llevar a la muerte por sobreinfecci\u00f3n bacteriana o al desarrollo de \nla fibrosis una vez superada la fase aguda. Otros pueden cronificarse dependiendo de la naturaleza propia de \nla enfermedad.  \n2.2 Tratamiento  \n2.2.1 Elaboraci\u00f3n de la f\u00f3rmula  \nF\u00f3rmula Yin Chai Xiao Du Dan modificado. Ingredientes: Chai Hu 24g, Huang Qin 9g, Jin Y in Hua 30g, Lian Qiao \n30g, Chang Pu 9g, Yu Jin 9g, Huo Xiang (agregar tarde) 9g, Pei Lan 9g, Yin Chen 30g, Bai Dou Kou (agregar tarde) \n6g, Dang Gui 9g, Dan Pi 9g, Yi Yi Ren 60g, Shi Shang Bo 30g, Shen Gan Cao 6g.   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           105 \n 2.2.2 Explicaci\u00f3n de la f\u00f3rmula Chai Hu m\u00e1s  Huang Qin se usa en el Calor por afecci\u00f3n externa. Como Sanjiao \nes la ruta de los humores, Xiao Chai Hu Tang tambi\u00e9n se indica para la tonificaci\u00f3n de los movimientos de los \nl\u00edquidos corporales, as\u00ed como dice: \u201cSi el Jiao superior se desbloquea, los l\u00edqui dos y los humores bajan y \nentonces, el Qi del est\u00f3mago se armoniza y el Calor se libera por sudoraci\u00f3n lluviosa\u201d. Se combina Jin Yin Hua \ncon Lian Quio para liberar el pat\u00f3geno externo. La asociaci\u00f3n de Chang Pu con Yu Jin previene el deterioro \nhacia la fas e cr\u00edtica como la aparici\u00f3n de coma y convulsiones, conceptualmente entendido por la MTC de la \nsiguiente manera: \u201cUna vez que el Calor superficial se interioriza, los meridianos colaterales profundos se \nbloquean\u201d. La suma de Huo Xiang y Pei Lan transforman  la Humedad por sus propiedades arom\u00e1ticas. Cabe \ndestacar que Pei Lan es un medicamento espec\u00edfico para la inhibici\u00f3n de secre - ci\u00f3n de mucoprote\u00ednas, que \ntradicionalmente se indica para tratar boca pas - tosa y boca dulce en la MTC. Se puede usar hasta 20 -30g de \nPei Lan para disminuir la secreci\u00f3n de grandes cantidades de mucoprote\u00ednas en el pulm\u00f3n, evitando las \nobstrucciones por flema. Yin Chen m\u00e1s Bai Dou Kou liberan la Humedad -Calor de Sanjiao. Dang Gui m\u00e1s Dan \nPi protege la capa sangu\u00ednea. En caso de co nstipaci\u00f3n, agregar Zi Cao. Yi Yi Ren elimina la Humedad -Calor \nexterna y es antiviral. Shi Shang Bo es espec\u00edfico para la infecci\u00f3n pulmonar. Sheng Gan Cao se usa para la \ndesintoxicaci\u00f3n ya que el \u00e1cido glicirret\u00ednico posee propiedades antiinflamatorias si milares a los \nglucocorticoides. Chai Hu es bueno para eliminar el Calor. Jin Yin Hua tiene buen efecto contra el dolor de \ngarganta. Se recomienda a\u00f1adir Pei Lan si hay s\u00edntomas gastrointestinales marcadas. Las propiedades \nespec\u00edficas del Yin Chai Xiao Du D an consiste en lo siguiente: Chai Hu m\u00e1s Huan Qin elimina Calor; Jin Yin Hua \nm\u00e1s Lian Qiao ex - pulsa el pat\u00f3geno a trav\u00e9s de la superficie y Pei Lan m\u00e1s Huo Xiang tonifica el est\u00f3mago. Se \npuede sustituir Jin Yin Hua por su roc\u00edo puesto que posee mejor prop iedad para liberar calor y evitar el bloqueo \ninterno.  \n2.2.3 Modificaciones  \nDebe prestarse especial atenci\u00f3n en pacientes con Insuficiencia del Yin, y evaluar la eliminaci\u00f3n de Chai Hu o \nen el peor de los casos sustituirlo por Sheng Di Huang 15g en pacient es que cursan con fiebre persistente por \nvarios d\u00edas, ya que \u00e9ste puede secuestrar Yin de H\u00edgado. La Insuficiencia del Yin aparece a menudo en pacientes \ncon fiebre, v\u00f3mito o diarrea persistente. Para el diagn\u00f3stico precoz de la Insuficiencia del Yin por S\u00ed ndrome \nHumedad -Calor hay que precisar si en la lengua existe peque\u00f1as grietas no constitucionales (explicado en la \nclase de inspecci\u00f3n de lengua las grietas constitucionales), que confirma la Insuficiencia.  \nHay 4 formas de abordaje para estos casos. Primer o, se aconseja quitar Chai Hu y agregar Sheng Di Huang para \nalimentar el Yin, de lo contrario, la Humedad -Calor dif\u00edcilmente reduce. Segundo, agregar Xuan Shen que \npotencia el cultivo del Yin. Se recomienda asociar Xuan Shen con Dang Gui 30g como antiinfla matorio (M\u00e9todo \nSi Miao Yong An Tang). Esto est\u00e1 contraindicado en pacientes en shock porque Xuan Shen y Dang Gui son \nvasodilatadores y bajan la presi\u00f3n arterial. Se ex - cepcionan su uso en casos con soporte vasopresor y \nmonitoreo estricto conti - nuo, por lo que se desaconseja su empleo en principiantes. Tercero, sumar Lu Gen \n30-50g. Este medicamento contiene coixenolida que facilita la eliminaci\u00f3n de Humedad y act\u00faa como antiviral; \ntambi\u00e9n con - tiene asparagina que potencia el cultivo del Yin y es antitus\u00ed gena; y vitamina B que regenera la \nsaburra; y antipir\u00e9tica. Por \u00faltimo, agregar Zhi Mu cuando el S\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor deteriora el Yin y se \nacompa\u00f1a de Calor. La fiebre persistente agota la corteza adrenal o altera el ritmo circadiano de la secreci\u00f3n \ncorticoidea. Zhi Mu protege la corteza adrenal (M\u00e9todos Bai Hu Tang y Da Yuan Yin) previniendo el deterioro \ndel Yin por el S\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor. Por lo que se recomienda su uso en estos pacientes. Se recomienda \nincorporar Dan Zhu Ye 30g m\u00e1s Lu Gen 30g cuand o la Humedad es m\u00e1s intensa.  \nSe recomienda incorporar Da Qing Ye 30g cuando el Calor es m\u00e1s intenso y Chen Pi 6 -9g como protector \ng\u00e1strico. Si a esta f\u00f3rmula se le a\u00f1ade Da Qing Ye, puede aparecer dolor abdominal, diarrea, falta de apetito \nen pacientes con  Insuficiencia del Bazo, por lo que no se recomienda dosis altas. Solo Da Qing Ye 15g \ncombinando con Chen Pi 9g o Cang Zhu 9g. Aunque altas dosis de Yi Yi Ren posee efectos antivirales marcados, \npero enfr\u00eda el est\u00f3mago, entonces, se recomienda agregar Chen  Pi.  \n2.3 Evoluci\u00f3n   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           106 \n La primera evoluci\u00f3n es hacia la fase cr\u00edtica de tipo severo. La segunda es la mejor\u00eda post tratamiento. La \ntercera es la aparici\u00f3n de Insuficiencia del Bazo m\u00e1s Humedad intensa luego de la mejor\u00eda posterior a la \ntransformaci\u00f3n en Calor  por Represi\u00f3n de Humedad. Cl\u00ednicamente se manifiesta el cambio de saburra a \nblanca, y la lengua a p\u00e1lida. En este momento de desaparici\u00f3n de calor, hay que indicar la f\u00f3rmula de fase \ntemprana, sustituyendo Gui Zhi por Rou Gui 3g en decocciones o Rou Gui 1 g v\u00eda oral y agregar hierbas que \ndispersan calor tales como Hua Shi, Han Shui Shi, etc. Si vuelve el Calor, reiniciar la f\u00f3rmula de fase intermedia, \ny as\u00ed viceversa. Ante la inexistencia de Insuficiencia del Bazo y de lengua p\u00e1lida, no se recomienda aborda r de \nesta manera. La cuarta evoluci\u00f3n consiste en la persistencia de Humedad -Calor. Debido a que la Humedad es \nun pat\u00f3geno Yin perverso, no se disuelve si no es con Calor. Pacientes con marcada Insuficiencia del Bazo que \nno muestra clara respuesta de trans formaci\u00f3n de Humedad luego de recibir esta f\u00f3rmula, se recomienda rotar \na f\u00f3rmula de fase temprana, sustituyendo Gui Zhi por Rou Gui 3g en decocciones o Rou Gui 1g v\u00eda oral y agregar \nhierbas que dispersan calor tales como Hua Shi, Han Shui Shi, etc y monit orizar estrictamente la respuesta \ninflamatoria.  \n3.Fase Huai Bing Huai  \nHuai Bing se asemeja a la fase cr\u00edtica de la medicina contempor\u00e1nea. Esta enfermedad tiene dos tipos de \npresentaciones: el primero, de tipo fulmi - nante, donde el paciente debuta en fase  cr\u00edtica y se observa \nprincipalmente cuando existe el Calor T\u00f3xico Candente. Este grupo de paciente evoluciona de manera r\u00e1pida \ny t\u00f3rpida hacia la muerte en poco tiempo, inclusive en mi - nutos cuando haya bloqueo interno del pericardio; \nel segundo es de ti po co - m\u00fan, donde las fases iniciales tienen un per\u00edodo prolongado hasta que el pa - ciente \nalcance el punto cr\u00edtico y desarrolle velozmente la transformaci\u00f3n en Calor con pronto deterioro de la \nenfermedad. Este estado cr\u00edtico requiere una atenci\u00f3n urgente y aparece muchas veces por haber ignorado \nlas fases inicia - les demasiado estables. Cl\u00ednicamente en Huai Bing (fase cr\u00edtica) se observan insuficiencia \ncard\u00edaca, insuficiencia respiratoria e insuficiencia renal, con disfunci\u00f3n hep\u00e1tica, gastrointestinal y t rastorno \nde la coagulaci\u00f3n que requiere reanimaci\u00f3n ur - gente. Frecuentemente se encuentra una disociaci\u00f3n entre el \nalivio sintom\u00e1tico y el curso de la enfermedad en Yi Bing. Para determinar el punto cr\u00edtico, hay que examinar \nsi la saburra lingual pertenec e al Calor intenso de Yangming. En casos no fulminantes el punto cr\u00edtico \ngeneralmente est\u00e1 alrededor del d\u00e9cimo d\u00eda, mientras que si no hubo deterioro luego de 14 d\u00edas, \ncomparativamente est\u00e1n fuera de peligro.  \nLas formas de diagnosticar Huai Bing son: Prim ero, examinar si existe gran cantidad de gloquidios en la lengua \nya que esto indica la profundizaci\u00f3n de la enfermedad a la capa sangu\u00ednea y ha ge - nerado cierto grado de \nhemorragia. Segundo, examinar la presencia o no de pulso cuerda filosa, que indica co nvulsi\u00f3n debido a la \nAgitaci\u00f3n Interna del Viento. La saburra lingual tam - bi\u00e9n aporta en el diagn\u00f3stico: es blanca, de capa gruesa \ny s\u00edmil polvo en Hu - medad intensa, mientras que es amarilla, de capa gruesa y seca, o exfoliada en Calor \nintenso. Ambos ind ican la persistencia de la enfermedad con proba - bilidad de deterioro hacia la fase cr\u00edtica. \nLa textura oscura y p\u00farpura de la lengua se\u00f1ala hipercoagulabilidad causada por la infecci\u00f3n si no fuese por \n\u00e9stasis sangu\u00ednea constitucional. En este caso, la pro gresi\u00f3n de la enfermedad suele ser m\u00e1s lenta. En la \naparici\u00f3n r\u00e1pida de lengua oscura y p\u00farpura en Wen Bing de Taiyin Pulmonar se debe descartar la baja \nsaturaci\u00f3n de ox\u00edgeno, indicador de gravedad en enferme - dades pulmonares, del \u00e9stasis sangu\u00ednea causad a \npor Calor ferviente. Este \u00faltimo puede generar hemorragias por lo que se recomienda agregar Qian Cao 30g, \nZi Cao 9g, Guan Zhong 15g, o directamente la f\u00f3rmula Shen Xi Dan de \u00a8Wen Re Jing Wei. \u00a8 En comparaci\u00f3n, la \ndificultad respiratoria m\u00e1s la semiolog\u00eda  de lengua y pulso son determinantes m\u00e1s espec\u00edficos que los s\u00edntomas \ngastrointestinales, la tos, el esputo y la fiebre para definir el avance de la enfermedad. Ante la aparici\u00f3n de \ndificultad respiratoria, en medios accesibles, hay que monitorear la satur aci\u00f3n de ox\u00edgeno y efectuar \nr\u00e1pidamente radiograf\u00eda de t\u00f3rax o tomo - graf\u00eda computada para esclarecer el estado pulmonar. En caso de \nfalla respi - ratoria derivar de modo urgente al servicio de emergencias. Se recomienda agregar Ma Huang 9g \ncon acci\u00f3n anti -choque, y la dosis puede alcanzar hasta 30 -40g seg\u00fan la tensi\u00f3n arterial; as\u00ed como las f\u00f3rmulas \nMa Xing Shi Gan Tang, Ma Xing Yi Gan Tang y Ma Huang Lian Qiao Chi Xiao Dou Tang, \u00e9ste \u00faltimo con buen \nefecto protector de da\u00f1o hep\u00e1tico post infecci\u00f3n viral. L a efedrina tiene acci\u00f3n s\u00edmil adrenalina. Ma Huang  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           107 \n Sheng Ma Tang es una f\u00f3rmula est\u00e1ndar de MTC para tratar infecciones graves. Dicha f\u00f3rmula trata las \ninfecciones severas y a los 6 meridianos en simult\u00e1neo. Para su indicaci\u00f3n hay que modificarla seg\u00fan sig no \nsintomatolog\u00eda. Se recomienda la posibilidad de aplicaci\u00f3n de inyectables anti insuficiencia card\u00edaca como Ren \nShen, Fu Zi, Yu Zhu, Shen Fu o Sheng Ma Por otro lado, pese a que Ban Bian Lian tiene efecto espec\u00edfico contra \nla falla respiratoria de origen  central, no se recomienda su uso en esta enfermedad por sus resul - tados \ndesalentadores especialmente en pacientes con alteraci\u00f3n del sensorio y convulsiones. El \u00e1cido glicirret\u00ednico \nes un s\u00edmil glucocorticoides. En caso de no contar con otra medicaci\u00f3n a ntiinflamatoria, sustituir los \nglucocorticoides por altas dosis de Gan Cao 30g que tiene efecto antiinflamatorio potente. No obstante, a\u00f1a - \ndir medicaci\u00f3n evacuadora de agua como Chen Pi y Fu Ling para antagonizar los efectos adversos de Gan Cao. \nChang Pu y Yu Jin son buenas opciones para prevenir la fase cr\u00edtica ya que evita el coma y las convulsiones, \nprecedidas por la opresi\u00f3n precordial de la fase temprana as\u00ed como lo explica \u201cUna vez que el Calor superficial \nse interio - riza, los meridianos colaterales  profundos se bloquean.\u201d Una vez instalado el coma y las \nconvulsiones, el tratamiento urgente tradicional de MTC son los \u201cTres Tesoros.\u201d El los pacientes que sufren \nda\u00f1o del Yin por el s\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor se recomienda indicar f\u00f3rmula Jia Wei Bai He Di Huang Tang (Bai \nHe, Sheng Di, Zhu Ye, Shi Gao y Dan Pi) m\u00e1s Hua Shi y Gan Cao con efecto anal\u00e9ptico marcado. Se recomienda \nagregar Jiang Nan Quan Bo 30g de inmediato sin otras evaluaciones en el marco de derrame peric\u00e1rdico o \nderrame pleural secunda - rio a  la extravasaci\u00f3n de l\u00edquido. Chan Tui es un estimulante de la s\u00edntesis de IFN y \nposee efecto antiviral potente como por ejemplo en la f\u00f3rmula Sheng Jiang San. Se puede usar altas dosis de \n30-40g, pero hay que tener extrema precauci\u00f3n en casos severos. No se recomienda indicarlo en contexto de \nrespuesta inflamatoria exagerada ni tampoco se recomienda su uso si no fueran expertos tanto en W\u00e9n Bing \nXue de MTC como en Infectolog\u00eda de medicina alop\u00e1tica.  \n4. Fase secuelar  \nLa secuela principal de esta enfermedad es el desarrollo de la fibrosis pulmonar. En este contexto se indica Yu \nKe Tang (Xiang Fu, Xuan Fu Hua, Yi Yi Ren, Tao Ren, Dang Gui, Wu Gong, San Qi, Bai Jie Zi) de la f\u00f3rmula de Wu \nMen. Contemplando los efectos adversos de cada medicina, se puede adicion ar Shan Ci Gu, Shang Lu, Zao Jiao \nCi seg\u00fan signo -sintomatolog\u00eda. Los que sufren de enfisema pulmonar deben tomar Tai Yi Xi Sui Gao durante 3 \na\u00f1os sucesivos. Para conocer su uso espec\u00edfico, consulte el libro Wu Men Yan Fang (F\u00f3rmulas eficaces de la \nfamilia Wu).  \n5. Prevenci\u00f3n y medidas higi\u00e9nico -diet\u00e9ticas  \n5.1 Prevenci\u00f3n Optimizar la ventilaci\u00f3n ambiental; evitar la concurrencia a lugares de concentraci\u00f3n \nmultitudinaria; prevenir el contacto con pacientes infectados; y a\u00fan m\u00e1s importante, evitar el cansancio  y el \nestr\u00e9s. Es fundamental el la - vado de manos con frecuencia y el uso de barbijos. Es necesario considerar la alta \ninfectividad de Yi Bing y Li Bing, as\u00ed como los antiguos chinos lo denominaban \u201cenfermedades de f\u00e1cil \ncontagio\u201d. Bajo estas condiciones, la inmunocompetencia de los individuos sanos es insufi - ciente para no \ncontraer esta enfermedad. Entonces, tampoco encuadra el concepto de \u201cSi conserva Qi Recto en el interior, \nel Qi Pat\u00f3geno perverso no puede invadir\u201d en esta patolog\u00eda de alta infectivida d, por ende, es sustancial evitar \nel contacto cercano. La MTC sugiere alimentar la energ\u00eda en postura sentada (Qigong y meditaci\u00f3n s\u012bm\u0101 -\nbandha), prender incienso (incluye el uso de sachet arom\u00e1tica) y evitar el miasma, medicamentos como Xiao \nJin Dan de Nei jing. Seg\u00fan este mismo protocolo, se puede alternar la indicaci\u00f3n de f\u00f3rmulas de fase tem - prana \ne intermedia seg\u00fan la constituci\u00f3n f\u00edsica de cada paciente y el nivel de exposici\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n se puede \ndigitopuntar la planta del pie (centro del aca - punto Yon  Quan, K1, 81 veces) y el arco del pie (en el centro \nacupunto de Ran Gu, K2, 81 veces, o simplemente de 5 a 10 minutos). Adem\u00e1s, hay que tener mucha cautela \nel contacto con pacientes conva - lecientes hasta los 14 d\u00edas posteriores ya que permanecen con infe ctividad \nactiva. Por el momento, tampoco se puede descartar la posibilidad de con - vertirse en portadores cr\u00f3nicos en \nalgunos casos espor\u00e1dicos. La clave reside en el pulso: a los que a\u00fan conservan el pulso impetuoso a la \npalpaci\u00f3n media y profunda, pese a  la mejor\u00eda cl\u00ednica e imagenol\u00f3gica, ll\u00e1mese curado, tienen mayor \nprobabilidad de transformarse en portador cr\u00f3nico.   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           108 \n 5.2 Medidas higi\u00e9nico -diet\u00e9ticas  \n\u2460 Dieta: caldo de arroz y gran cantidad de verduras. Evitar comidas grasientas, dulzonas y bebidas fr\u00edas.  Es \nimportante mantener un buen ritmo eva - cuatorio.  \n\u2461 Evitar agotamiento f\u00edsico, mental y sexual. Se recomienda abstinencia sexual hasta 14 d\u00edas posteriores a la \nconvalecencia.  \n6. Instructivo de la gu\u00eda  \n6.1 Puntos claves para el diagn\u00f3stico y tratamient o: \nEl punto clave para diferenciar y tratar las enfermedades Wen Bing reside en dilucidar el mecanismo \nfisiopatol\u00f3gico principal. Cuantos m\u00e1s tipos de s\u00edn - dromes se describa por esta enfermedad m\u00e1s lejos estamos \nde la esencia de Wen Bing. Con respecto a e sto, lo mejor es lograr una hierba por enfermedad, o si no fuera \nposible, una f\u00f3rmula. A\u00fan no poder conseguirlo, hay que definir por lo menos el s\u00edndrome central seg\u00fan el \nmecanismo fisiopatol\u00f3gico princi - pal. \nAunque cl\u00ednicamente diferentes factores originar\u00e1n m\u00faltiples tipos de s\u00edndromes paralelos o transformantes \ncapaces de influir en el pron\u00f3stico, no obstante, no reflejan la esencia propia de la enfermedad. Es \nconsiderable mejorar el s\u00edndrome, compuesto por signos y s\u00edntomas, mientras que es im - prescindible el \ntratamiento dirigido desde la MTC a la noxa causante de Wen Bing y Li Bing y al mecanismo fisiopatol\u00f3gico \nprincipal.

Rece ived: \n2020.03.02; Accepted: 2020.03.08; Published: 2020.03.15  \nAbstract  \nCurrently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2, formerly known as 2019 -nCoV, the \ncausative pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19)) has rapidly spread across China and around the \nworld, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. No specific anti -virus drugs or vaccines are \navailable for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease. The supportive care and non -specific treatment \nto ameli orate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently. At the top of these conventional \ntherapies, greater than 85% of SARS -CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese \nMedicine (TCM) treatment. In this article, relevant pu blished literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current \napplications of TCM in the treatment of COVID -19 patients are analyzed. Due to the homology in epidemiology, \ngenomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the  treatment of \nSARS -CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS \ncoronaviral infections are discussed. Current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism \nunderlying the therapeutic  effect of TCM, and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds \nwith anti -coronaviral activity are also introduced.  \nKey words: SARS -CoV-2, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), coronavirus pneumonia  \nIntroduction  \nIn December 2019, there was a n outbreak of unexplainable pneumonia in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China \n[1]. By Jan 7, 2020, it was confirmed that a new type of coronavirus named SARS -CoV-2 (formerly named as \n2019 -nCoV) had emerged [2]. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the Wu han pneumonia as \nCoronavirus Disease -2019 (COVID -19) on Feb 11, 2020 [3]. The COVID -19 patients showed typical respiratory \nsymptom (such as cough, fever, and lung damage) and some other symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, and \ndiarrhea [4, 5]. As of February  17, 2020, a total of 73,332 cases of the SARS -CoV-2 infected pneumonia has \nbeen reported in China and 25 other countries, of which 72,528 cases was found in China [6]. Due to the rapid \nspread of SARS -CoV-2 through human -to-human transmission, the cases cu rrently continue to rise.  \nSARS -CoV-2 extracted from patients with pneumonia in Wuhan is an enveloped single stranded RNA -type \nbeta -coronavirus [7]. The genome sequences of SARS -CoV-2 shared 79.5% sequence identity to severe acute \nrespiratory syndrome -relat ed coronaviruses (SARS -CoV) [8, 9]. In addition, the spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV-\n2 and SARS -CoV enters human alveolar epitelial cells through binding angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) \nreceptor [8]. COVID -19 can be diagnosed by either chest CTradiogr aphy or a laboratory testing. Unfortunately, \nspecific antiviral drugs or vaccines currently have not been available for the treatment [10, 11]. According to  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           110 \n coronaviral will be summarized and analyzed, including the laboratory studies that provide an insig ht into \nmolecular basis of therapeutic benefits.  \nConventional treatment of SARS -CoV-2: is there a room for Chinese medicine? Due to the absence of a specific \nantiviraltherapeutics and vaccine, main treatment strategy for COVID -19 is supportive care, which is \nsupplemented by the combination of broad -spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, corticosteroids and convalescent \nplasma [16] (Table 1). HIV protease inhibitors ritonavir and lopinavir have been used, typically in combination \nwith appropriate antibiotics or w ith IFN \u03b1-2b, in the treatment of SARS -CoV-2 infected patients [7, 17]. \nNucleoside analogs such as ribavirin [12] may be potentially beneficial for the treatment of COVID -19, since \nribavirin was approved for treating respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infect ion [18] and used extensively during \nthe SARS and MERS outbreak [10]. However, ribavirin had severe side effects such as anemia [18] and whether \nit had sufficient antiviral activity against SARS -CoV-2 is unclear. Nucleoside analogs favipiravir (T -705) can \neffectively inhibit the activity of RNA polymerase of RNA viruses such as influenza [19]. A recent in vitro study \nfound that it had the anti -SARS -CoV-2 activity [20], but the in vivo effect remains elusive. Remdesivir may be \nthe most promising antiviral dr ug for treating COVID -19. It has in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against a \nwide array of RNA viruses including SARS and MERS [21], and could decrease viral loads and pathology of lungs \nin animal models [22]. A study showed remdesivir markedly inhib ited the infection of SARS -CoV-2 in Vero E6 \ncells [20], and most symptoms of the first US patient infected with SARS -CoV-2 had resolved swiftly after \nintravenous administration with remdesivir [23]. Currently, it is under clinical trial to evaluate the saf ety and \nefficacy of intravenous remdesivir for patients with SARS -CoV-2 infection [24]. Oral oseltamivir has been used \nfor the treatment of the cases with SARS -CoV-2 [7], while its efficacy currently remains uncertain.  \nHost -targeted small molecules approved for other human diseases may modulate the virus -host interactions \nof SARS -CoV-2. Chloroquine, a potential broad -spectrum antiviral drug [25, 26], was shown by a recent study \nhad anti -SARS -CoV-2 activity [20]. Its clinical efficacy is und er study in an open -label trial (ChiCTR2000029609) \n[12]. IFN \u03b1 (5 million U) atomization inhalation was recommended as antiviral therapy to treat SARS -CoV-2 \n[16]. A trial testing IFN \u03b1-2b combination of the approved anti -HCV inhibitors has been initiated [17 ], however, \nwhether it could act synergistically against SARS -CoV-2 is unclear. Corticosteroids were frequently used to \nsuppress the elevated cytokine levels in patients with SARS -CoV [27, 28] and MERS -CoV [29, 30]. However, \nthere are no evidence showing t hat the mortality of SARS and MERS patients was reduced by the treatment \nwith corticosteroids, while the clearance of viral was delayed by such treatment [31 -33]. Consequently, \ncorticosteroids are not suggested to systemically use in SARS -CoV-2 infected pa tients [34, 35].  \nPreviously, it was shown that, either in severe influenza or SARS -CoV infection, convalescent plasma treatment \ncould significantly decrease viral load and reduce the mortality [31, 36]. Convalescent plasma has been used \nfor severe SARS -CoV-2 infection in China [22], although promising, the efficacy and safety need to becarefully \nfurther evaluated. Consistent with previous analysis, WHO alsoconcluded \"to date, there is no specific \nmedicine recommended to prevent or treat SARS -CoV-2\" [37]. TC M has been used in control of infectious \ndiseases for thousands of years. There is a clear room for the intervention of TCM as a complementary therapy \nfor COVID -19 patients. It is reported that the patientswith SARS -CoV infection have benefited from TCM \ntreatment [38], including amelioration of side effect of conventionaltherapeutics [39, 40]. Based on these \nfactors, there is a general expectation that TCM would be a valuable weapon in the armory against SARS -CoV-\n2. \nTraditional Chinese Medicine in the treat ment of patients infected with SARS -CoV: clinical evidence  \nApplication of TCM in the treatment of SARS -CoV-2 is largely inspired by the treatment of SARS caused by \noutbreak of SARS coronavirus (SARS -CoV) in the late of 2002 in the Guangdong Province of Ch ina which spread \nrapidly during the 2003, with the cumulative number worldwide of over 8,000 [41 -43]. Ranging from case \nreports, case series, controlled observational studies and randomized clinical trials, clinical studies aiming to \nexamine the effect of TCM on SARS have been carried out and reported. There are quite compelling evidences \nsupport the notion that TCM has beneficial effect in the treatment or prevention of SARS. For example, the  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           111 \n rate of fatality in Hong Kong and Singapore was approximately 18 %, while the rate for Beijing was initially \nmore than 52% until the 5th of May and decreased gradually to 4% -1% after the 20th of May in 2003. The \ndramatic reduced fatality from late May in Beijing was believed to be associated with the use of TCM as a \nsupplement to the conventional therapy [44]. Lau and colleagues reported that, during SARS outbreak, 1063 \nvolunteers including 926 hospital workers and 37 laboratory technicians working in high -risk virus laboratories \nused a TCM herbal extract, namely Sang Ju  Yin plus Yu Ping Feng San. Compared with the 0.4% of infection in \nthe control group, none of TCM users infected. Furthermore, there was some evidence that Sang Ju Yin plus \nYu Ping Feng San could modulate T cells in a manner to enhance host defense capacit y [45, 46]. In a controlled \nclinical study, the supplementary treatment with TCM resulted in marked improvement of symptoms and \nshortened the disease course [47]. The clinical beneficial effect of TCM appears to be supported by laboratory \nstudies. For exam ple, a high -profile research published in the Lancet reported that glycyrrhizin, a major active \nconstituent liquorice root which is the most frequently used Chinese herb, potently inhibited the replication \nof clinical isolates of SARS virus [48]. Another i ndependent study confirmed the antivirus activity of glycyrrhizin \nby plaque reduction assays and this study found that another Chinese herbal compound baicalin also had the \nanti-SARS activity [49]. Furthermore, Wang et al. found MOL376, a compound derived from TCM, may become \na lead compound for SARS therapy by inhibition of cathepsin L, a target for the treatment of SARS [50]. There \nis a myriad of literature on TCM treatments for SARS published after the SARS epidemicin China. A critical \nanalysis of thesep ublications would be useful to confirm the beneficial effect of TCM. Liu et al. systematically \nreviewed eight randomized controlled trials, and concluded that, by combination with conventional medicine, \nTCM showed the beneficial effects such as decrease of  mortality and relief of symptom, as well as control of \nfungal infections in patients with SARS. However, the evidence is not sufficient enough due to the poor quality \nof methodology used in the trials [13]. Leung analyzed 90 peer -reviewed papers with reas onable quality from \n130 publications and concluded that TCM used together with conventional treatment had some positive \neffects, including better control of fever, quickerclearance of chest infection and other symptoms. However, \nsuch beneficial effect of T CM is not conclusive and more high -quality clinical studies are required [15].  \nIn another thorough literatura analysis, Liu and colleagues concluded that there was no benefit of adjuvant \ntreatment with TCM in terms of mortality [39]. Due to the lack of hig h quality TCM trials and biases that \ninfluenced the validity of results, Wu and colleagues suggested to re -run clinical trials of TCM for the treatment \nof acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) [51].  \nIdentification of anti -novel coronaviral compound fr om Traditional Chinese Medicine Natural products used \nin TCM remains to be a wealthy source for the identification of noveltherapeuticagents for the treatment of \nhuman diseases [52]. In the past decade, scientists have made a considerable effort to identif y multiple \ncomponent herbal formulae in TCM with anti -SARS -CoV activity (Table 2). Further identification of chemical \nentities contained in TCM herbs responsible for the anti -SARS - CoV effect was also pursued (Table 3). Due to \nthe homology of SARS -CoV and SARS -CoV-2, these previous studies may shed light on the naturally occurring \ncompounds with the capacity to inhibit SARS -CoV-2. 3- chymotrypsin -like protease (3CLpro) is vital for \nreplication of virus, and thusrepresents apromising drug target for the deve lopment of therapeutics agents \nfor SARS -CoV as well as other human coronaviruses including SARS -CoV-2. It was reported that following TCM \nherbal extracts had the capacity to inhibit the enzymatic activity of SARS 3CLpro: Chinese Rhubarb extracts \n(IC50: 13. 76 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcg/mL) [53], water extract of Houttuynia cordata [54, 55], flavonoid extracted from litchi \nseeds [56] and beta -sitosterol (IC50: 1210\u00b5M) extracted from the root extractof Isatis indigotica [57]. Further, \nfollowing herb -derived naturally occurring  compounds including sinigrin (IC50: 217\u00b5M), indigo (IC50: 752\u00b5M), \naloe -emodin (IC50: 366 \u00b5M), hesperetin (IC50:8.3 \u00b5M)[57], quercetin (IC50:73\u00b5M), epigallocatechin gallate \n(IC50: 73\u00b5M), gallocatechin gallate (IC50: 47 \u00b5M) [58], herbacetin, rhoifolin and p ectolinarin [59] were able to \ninhibit the SARS 3CLpro activity. Moreover, the flavonoids namely herbacetin, isobavaschalcone, quercetin 3\u2010\n\u03b2\u2010D\u2010glucoside, and helichrysetin had the potential to block the enzymatic activity of MERS\u2010CoV 3CL protease \n[60]  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           112 \n  \nDu Bu Fei Tang (IC50:471.3 \u00b5g/mL), Sinomenium acutum (IC50:198.6 \u00b5g/mL), Coriolus versicolor (IC50:108.4 \n\u00b5g/mL) and Ganoderma lucidum (IC50:41.9 \u00b5g/mL) inhibited SARS -CoV RdRp in a dose - dependent manner \n[54]. Wu et al. performed large - scale screening of exi sting drugs, natural products, and synthetic compounds \n(>10000 compounds) to identify effective anti -SARS -CoV agents through a cell -based assay with SARS virus \nand Vero E6 cells [62]. They found that ginsenoside -Rb1 isolated from Panax ginseng, aescin isol ated from the \nhorse chestnut tree, reserpine contained in the genus Rauwolfia and extracts of eucalyptus and Lonicera \njaponica inhibited SARS -CoV replication at non -toxic concentrations [62].  \nSame as SARS -CoV and HCoV -NL63, SARS -CoV-2 uses host receptor AC E2 for the cellular entrance [63 -66]. \nTherefore, TCM with the capacity to target ACE2 holds the promise to prevent theinfection of SARS -CoV-2. \nEmodin from genus Rheum and Polygonum [67], baicalin from in Scutellariabaicalensis [44,68], nicotianamine \nfrom f oodstuff (especially \u201csoybean ACE2 inhibitor (ACE2iSB)\u201d) [69], scutellarin [70], tetra -O-galloyl -\u03b2-D-\nglucose (TGG) from Galla chinensis and luteolin from Veronicalina riifolia [71] markedly inhibited the \ninteraction of SARS -CoV S -protein  \nand ACE2. However,  the anti -SARS -CoV activity of these compounds remain to be evaluated. In addition, \ninhibition of the 3a ion channel by emodin [72] or kaempferol derivatives - juglanin [73] could potentially \nprevent the viral release from the infected cells. Saikosaponins [74], glycyrrhizin [48, 75], quercetin and TSL -1 \nextracted from Toona sinensis Roem [76] purportedly had potent anti -SARS -CoV effects by inhibition of viral \ncellular entry, adsorption, and penetration. Overwhelming inflammatory responses are attributable t o the \ndeaths of patients with infection of SARS -CoV, or MERS -CoV, or COVID -19. Thus, anti -inflammatory agents \npresumably could reduce the severity and mortality rate [77]. Shuang Huang Lian, a TCM herbal product \nprepared from Lonicerae japonicae Flos, Scut ellariae radix and Fructus Forsythiae, purportedly had the activity \nto inhibit SARS -CoV-2 [78]. Interestingly, We have shown that this herbal preparation potently inhibited \nstaphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST -1)-induced production of cytokine s (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF -\u03b1, IFN -\n\u03b3) andchemokines (MIP -1\u03b1, MIP -1\u03b2 and MCP -1) by peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) [79]. In line with \nour results, this herbal product was shown to markedly reduced the transcriptional and translational levels of \ninflammator y cytokines TNF -\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL -6 in lipopolysaccharide -stimulated murine alveolar macrophages \n[80]. Indirubin is an active ingredient of a TCM preparation Dang Gui Long Hui Pill, had strong antiviral and \nimmunomodulatory effects, as shown by a study base d on the observation of influenza H5N1 virus -infected \nhuman macrophages and type -I alveolar epithelial cells [81]. Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule was reported to have \nin vitro activity in inhibition of propagation of various influenza viruses. This TCM herbal p roduct not only \nblocked the early stages of influenza virus infection but also inhibited virus -induced gene expression of IL -6, \nIL-8, TNF -a, IP -10, and MCP -1 [82]. Additionally, a study by Dong et al. reported that the levels of IL -8, TNF -\u03b1, \nIL-17, and IL -23 in the sputum and of IL -8 and IL -17 in the blood were markedly decreased after Lian Hua Qing \nWen Capsule treatment in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [83]. A \nself-control study by Poon et al. showed that the adm inistration of the TCM herbal formulas (Sang Ju Yin and \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           113 \n Yu Ping Feng San) may have beneficial immunomodulatory effects for the prevention of viral infections \nincluding SARS -CoV [46].  \nMoreover, a number of anti -coronaviral agents have been identified from T CM herbs, although the \nmechanisms of action have not yet been elucidated. For example, extracts from Lycoris radiata, Artemisia \nannua, Pyrrosia lingua, and Lindera aggregate possessed the anti \u2013SARS -CoV activity [84], 3 \u03b2-Friedelanol \nisolated from Euphorbia neriifolia [85], Blancoxanthone isolated from the roots of Calophyllum blancoi [86] \nexhibited anti -HCoV -229E activity.  \nTraditional Chinese Medicine used in the treatment of SARS -CoV-2-infected patients: the current situations \nTCM is highly valued by the go vernment of China in their campaign to contain and eradiate SARS -CoV-2. For \nexample, Health Commission in 26 provinces have officially declared that TCM should be used in combination \nwith conventional medicine in the treatment of COVID -19 patients. On 17, February, National Health \nCommission (NHC) of the People\u2019s Republic of China reported that 60,107 confirmed COVID -19 patients \n(85.20% of total confirmed cases) had been treated with TCM [87]. As for March 1, 2020, a total of 303 ongoing \nclinical trials aim ing to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatments for CoV -19 patients have been launched \nin China. Among them, 50 trials (16.5%) are about the use of TCM, including 14 cases (4.6%) to examine the \neffect of combined treatment with TCM and Western medici ne. In 22 TCM trials (7.3%), the effect of self -made \nherbal preparations such as Xin Guan -1 Formula, Xin Guan -2 Formula and Qing Yi -4 are examined. In another \n14 TCM trials (4.6%), commercially available TCMproducts such as Tan Re Qing Injection and Lian H ua Qing \nWen Capsule are studied (Table 4). To date, NHC has published 6 editions Guidelines of Diagnosis and \nTreatment for COVID -19 [88]. Since the fourth versions, different herbal medicinesused in TCM system has \nbeen recommended for the treatment of COVI D-19, based on the stage of disease and symptom \ndifferentiation [89]. According to the latest edition of Guideline [88], following multiple componentChinese \nherbal products are recommended for the patients in the medical observationperiod, presumably as \napreventive measure: Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Shui, Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule, Shu Feng Jie Du Capsule and Jin \nHua Qing Gan Granule. In the clinical treatment period, Qing Fei Pai Du Tang, Xi Yan Ping Injection, Xue Bi Jing \ninjection, Re Du Ning Injection, Tan Re Qing Injection Xing Nao.  \nJing Injection and some other Chinese medicineformulae should beselected [90]. Inaddition, for the patients \nin critical condition, Shen Fu Injection, Sheng Mai Injection, Shen Mai Injection, Su He Xiang Pill and An Gong \nNiu Huang P ill should be administered (Table 5). Through analysis of the frequency of TCM used in 23 \nprovinces, Luo, et al. [37] concluded that Astragalus membranaceus, Glycyrrhizae uralensis, Saposhnikoviae \ndivaricata, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, Lonicerae J aponicae Flos, Fructus forsythia, Atractylodis \nRhizoma, Radix platycodonis, Agastache rugosa, and Cyrtomium fortune J. Sm were 10 most commonly used \nChinese herbs in the treatment of COVID -19. Xu, et al. [91] reported that Astragalus membranaceus and Yu \nPing Feng were used in the 13 prevention programs (in Beijing, Tianjin, et al.) for \u201creinforcing vital qi\u201d, a \nterminology used in TCM that is similar to boosting host defense capacity.  \nOphiopogon japonicas and Scrophularia ningpoensisand are TCM herbs which were most frequently used \nfor\u201cnourishing yin\u201d in northern China, while Atractylodis Rhizoma, Agastache rugosa and other Chinese \nmedicinal herbs with the property of \u201caromatic dehumidification\u201d were commonly used in southern China \n(Table 6).   \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           114 \n  \n \nAccording t o the report of National  \nAdministration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, up to February 5th, 2020, 214 COVID -19 patients were treated \nwith Qing Fei Pai Du Tang in Shanxi, Hebei, Heilongjiang and Shaanxi Provinces with overall effective rate \u2265 \n90%. Among th em, the symptoms of majority of patients (\u226560%) were markedly improved, while illness of \nothers (30%) was stabilized [92]. After that, 701 COVID -19 patients were treated with Qing Fei Pai Du Tang in \n10 provinces in China. The result showed that 130 patient s (18.5%) were completely cured after treatment. \nThe treatment also resulted in the disappearance of characteristic symptoms ofCOVID -19 such as fever and \ncough in 51 patients (7.27%). In addition, symptom improvement or stabilization were observed in 268 \npatients (38.2%), and in 212 patients (30.2%), respectively [87]. Yao, et al. and Lu, et al. [93, 94] retrospectively \nanalyzed the clinical efficacy of Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule in treatment of confirmed and suspected COVID -\n19 patients. The results indicate d that this herbal product could markedly relieve major symptoms such as \nfever and cough and had the capacity to promote the recovery. Some patients with mild illness in the early \nstage could suddenly progress to severe disease, and eventually died due to septic shock with multiple organ \ndysfunction syndrome (MODS), which was associated with cytokine storm [95]. There is compelling evidence \nthat some TCM herbal products or its components have potent immunosuppressive effects, as shown by our \nown and other\u2019s  studies [79, 96 -103]. For example, Wang, et al. [104] reported that Shen Fu Injection could \ninhibit the lung inflammation and decrease the levels of IL -1\u03b2, IL-6 and other cytokines. Chang, et al. [105] \nreported that Re Du Ning Injection could markedly red uce the levels of IL -1\u03b2, TNF -\u03b1, IL-8, IL -10, and some \nother cytokines ofLPS -induced model of acute lung injury in rats. We recently reported that tetrandrine,a \ncompoundisolated from an anti -rheumatic Chinese herb, could potently inhibit proinflammatory Th1 , Th2 and \nTh17 responses in LPS -challenged mice [106]. Therefore, TCM with the capacity to inhibit cytokine storm and \nits devastating consequences may be harnessed in the treatment of severe COVID -19 patients. Currently, the \nlaboratory study on the effect ofT CM isapparently lagging behind the clinical application of TCM in the \ntreatment of COVID -19 patients. Nevertheless, some scientists have started to examine the effect of TCM \nproducts or its components on SARS -CoV-2 in their laboratories. For example, a n in vitro study showed that \nShuang Huang Lian Oral Liquid had the inhibitory effect on SARS -CoV-2 [78]. However, its clinical efficacy and \nsafety for thetreatment of COVID -19 patients has not been evaluated. We noticed that this TCM product was \nnot recomm ended by HNC\u2019s Guideline [89]. Same as SARS -CoV, SARS -CoV-2 uses receptor ACE2 for the cellular \nentrance [8]. Theoretically, blockade of ACE2 can prevent the infection of SARS -CoV-2. Chen and Du thus \nperformed the molecular docking study and they found tha t TCM -derived compounds, including as baicalin, \nscutellarin, hesperetin, glycyrrhizin and nicotianamine could interact with ACE2 [107]. Therefore, these \ncompoundsas well as herbs containing these ingredients may have the capacity to inhibit the infection o f SARS -\nCoV-2. We anticipate more experiment studies showing anti -SARS -CoV-2 activity of TCM or its components \nwill be published in the near future. Closing remarks TCM TCM hasaccumulatedthousand -of-year\u2019s \nexperiences in the treatment of pandemicandendemic diseases. Providing complementary and alternative \ntreatments are still urgently needed for the management of patients with SARS -CoV-2 infection, experiencesin \nTCM is certainly worth learning.  \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           115 \n Fighting against current epidemics also provide an opportunity t o test the true value of TCM in treating \nemerging contagious diseases. Randomized, double -blind and placebo -controlled studies is the best way to \nprovide the most reliable evidence for a therapy,including TCM. It is encouraging that thecontrolled clinical \nstudies to evaluate the efficacy of TCM in the treatment of SARS -CoV were conducted and reported. However, \nthe most of these studies were found to be poorly designed and the results could lead to potential biasesin \nevaluating theeffectiveness of TCM treatm ent [13]. Hopefully, current clinical study to evaluate the effect of \nTCM on COVID -19 will use more strict protocols, concealment of allocation, and double -blinding, in order to \nensure the compliance of international acceptable standards. Furthermore, stan dardized products of TCM, \nrather than self -prepared formulations, should be used in clinical study. Experiment study may be able to \nelucidate the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM in the treatment of COVID -19. The further \nstudy of TCM may lead to the identification of novel anti human coronavirus compounds that may eventually \nprove to be useful in the treatment of SARS -CoV-2 or other emerging fatal viral diseases as conventional \ntherapeutic agents. The safety of TCM in the treatment of emer ging coronavirus diseases was not included in \nthe observation on SARS patients [13]. It was reported that some herbs used in TCM contain nephrotoxins and \nmutagens [108], while the toxicological features of the most of Chinese herbal medicines remain to be fully \nunderstood [109]. Furthermore, herbs used in TCM can mimic, or magnify, or oppose the effect of \nconventional medicines [110]. Thus, the safety of TCM used in treatment of emerging coronavirus infections \nshould be carefully evaluated. It is particular ly important to avoid toxicity or interfere with the efficacy of \nconventional treatment caused by herb -drug interaction.  \nSupplementary Material Supplementary figures and tables.  \nhttp://www.ijbs.com/v16p1708s1.pdf  \nAcknowledgement This project has been funded by Macau Science and Technology Development Fund (FDCT) \nresearch grant 201/2017/A3 and 0056/2019/AFJ and Uni - versity of Macau research grant MYRG2017 -00120 - \nICMS and MYRG2019 -00169 -ICMS.  \nCompeting Interests  \nThe authors have declared that no competing interest exists.  \nReferences  \n1.

Introduction  \nToward the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus  (2019 -nCoV) with human -to-human transmission and \nsevere human infection, originating in Wuhan, China, was identified [1]. This virus has affected many persons \nin China and spread to other countries in a very short time. On January 30, 2020, the Director -General of the \nWorld Health Organization declared that the outbreak of 2019 -nCoV constitutes a public health emergency of \ninternational concern and issued temporary recommendations under the International Health Regulations [2]. \nAccording to the Daily Repor t of China National Health Commission, as of this writing on February 2, 2020, \n14,488 cases, including 304 deaths, have been confirmed in China; 146 cases, including 1 death, have also \nbeen reported among 23 other countries. This pandemic is still ongoing,  so it is urgent to find new preventive \nand therapeutic agents as soon as possible. In addition, commensurate with the risk, strong measures for early \ndetection, isolation and treatment of cases, as well as minimization of transmission through social inter action \nmust be implemented.  \nWhile specific vaccines and antiviral agents are the most effective methods to prevent and treat viral infection, \nthere are not yet effective treatments that target the 2019 -nCoV. Development of this treatment may require \nmonth s or years, meaning that a more immediate treatment or control mechanism should be found if possible. \nHerbs used in traditional Chinese medicine present a potentially valuable resource to this end. The \neffectiveness of herbal treatment to control contagiou s disease was demonstrated during the 2003 severe \nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak [3]. As such, the Chinese government is encouraging the use of \nherbal plants in fighting this new viral pneumonia. However, the application of herbal treatment is mainly \nguided by the type of herb (based on the catalogue of classic literature on herbs) and the patient\u2019s symptoms \nor signs. There is often not enough information to predetermine whether the herbs in question can directly \ntarget the viral cause, in other  words, herbal usage is generally not guided by viral pathology. We think more \ndetailed knowledge about the direct antiviral effects of different plants would be greatly helpful to the doctors \nselecting them. In fact, after the outbreak of SARS, many group s dedicated themselves to finding anti -\ncoronavirus agents, including some natural compounds that exist in traditional Chinese herbal medicines [4 \u2013\n12]. The coronavirus encodes more than one dozen proteins, some of which are essential to viral entry and \nreplication. Among these proteins, the most well -studied are papain -like protease (PLpro), 3C -like protease \n(3CLpro) and spike protein. Coronavirus PLpro not only processes the viral polypeptide onto functional \nproteins but is also a deubiquitinating enzyme th at can dampen host anti -viral response by hijacking the \nubiquitin (Ub) system. For example, SARS PLpro cleaves ISG15, a two -domain Ub -like protein, and Lys48 -linked \npolyUb chains, releasing diUbLys48 products [13,14]. SARS -3CLpro is a cysteine protease ind ispensable to the \nviral life cycle [15]. Coronavirus spike protein uses angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 as a receptor to help the \nvirus enter cells [16]. These three proteins make attractive targets for drug development. Through in silico and \nbiological pr ocessing, a series of small molecules, including those from natural compounds, have been \nscreened and confirmed to directly inhibit these important proteins in SARS or Middle East respiratory \nsyndrome (MERS) coronavirus [17 \u201323]. The gene sequence of 2019 -nCoV has been released, which suggests \nhigh similarities between the main proteins in this virus and those previously identified in SARS -Cov or MERS -\nCov [24,25]. In this sense, previously reported anti -SARS -Cov or anti -MERS -Cov natural compounds may \nbecome a valuable guide to finding anti -coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) herbal plants among the traditional Chinese \nherbs used to treat viral pneumonia. It is a challenge to screen out the herbs containing anti -coronavirus (2019 - \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           123 \n nCoV) compounds from the large number of t hose possibly being used for patients infected with this \npathogen, especially in very short time. Here, we propose two principles to guide such work: oral effectiveness \nand compatibility. The first principle refers to the fact that most Chinese herbal plan ts are orally ingested after \nboiling with water, meaning that the anti -coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) ingredients in selected plants should be \nabsorbable via oral preparation. The second principle recognizes that candidate plants should be consistent \nwith the typ e classifications for traditional herbal usage, since type -guided applications are integral to herbal \nuse, as mentioned above. Following these two principles, we used a 6 -step selection process (3 for each \nprinciple), including drug -likeness, evaluation of  oral bioavailability, molecular docking, network \npharmacology analysis and other methods to identify herbs that have both a high possibility of containing \neffective anti -coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) compounds and are classified as treating virus -caused respira tory \ninfection .  \n2. Materials and methods  \n2.1. Literature search and compound selection PubMed literature concerning natural compounds against SARS \nor MERS coronavirus activity was selected using the query \u201ccoronavirus AND inhibitor AND (SARS OR MERS \nOR SA RS-CoV OR MERS -CoV).\u201d After careful reading of the studies returned by this search, the natural \ncompounds that had biologically confirmed antiviral activities were compared with the Traditional Chinese \nMedicine Systems Pharmacology database (TCMSP, http:// www.tcmspw.com/browse.php?qc=herbs), the \nEncyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM, http://www.nrc.ac.cn:9090/ETCM/) and SymMap \n(https://www.symmap.org/). Natural compounds both associated with antiviral activity and contained in \nherbs were examin ed in the next step of our study. 2.2. ADME screening of natural compounds Since Chinese \nherbal treatments are always taken orally after boiling with water, an in silico integrative model of absorption, \ndistribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) was use d to screen for natural compounds that may be \nbioactive via oral administration. The indices used for the screening include evaluation of oral bioavailability, \nCaco -2 permeability, drug -like value, and drug half -life. The threshold values indicating effect iveness for these \nfour indices were > 30%, > \u20130.4, > 0.18 and > 3 h, respectively, as recommended by Hu et al [26]. The values \nof these four indices can be obtained from the TCMSP database. 2.3. Protein -molecular docking We used \nmolecular docking software AutoDock 4 to perform protein compound docking analysis, according to the \nfollowing procedure: (1) We built three -dimensional (3D) structure files of the proteins. We used the online \nserver SWISS -MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) to build the 3D struc tures of the proteins of interest \nby template -based modeling, these template structures being the reported 3D structures of the corresponding \nproteins from SARS -CoV. The models built were of Protein Data Bank (PDB) format. (2) To retrieve the required \n3D s tructure files of compounds, the structure data file (SDF) format of compounds were retrieved from the \nPubChem website and then converted to PDB format by Discovery Studio. (3) AutoDock 4.2 was used to \nprepare PDBQT format files for target and ligand scree ning (Target.pdbqt and Ligand.pdbqt) and grid and \ndocking parameter files (a.gpf and a.dpf). (4) Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock in Cygwin and \nfinally the results were analyzed. The process and parameters used were detailed by Rizvi et al [2 7]. 2.4. Plant \nselection Herbs were selected through three steps. (1) Primary selection: molecules chosen from the above \nsteps were used as input for the TCMSP, ETCM and SymMap to search for plants containing that input and the \nplants were filtered by the numbers of antiviral compounds they contain. Those containing 2 or more antiviral \ncompounds were selected for the next step. (2) Classic usage catalogue cross -reference: only herbs \ntraditionally used to treat viral respiratory infection were retained for f urther study. (3) Predication of general \neffects in vivo with network pharmacology analysis, which is detailed as follows. 2.5. Network pharmacology \nanalysis The TCMSP provided the main components of each herb and the protein targets for each. We \nidentifie d the reported chemical constituents for each plant in the final analysis and used the ADME indices \nlisted above to find the orally absorbable and drug -like compounds for the plant. The protein targets of these \ncompounds were downloaded from the TCMSP data base. All protein targets for each individual plant were \nused as input for the String online server (https://string -db.org/) to perform protein -protein interaction  \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           124 \n analysis and pathway enrichment. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enr iched \n(with P < 0.01) by the input were downloaded.  \nAll data were processed using the statistical language R (3.6.2), unless otherwise specified.  \n3. Results  \n3.1. Overlapping of natural compounds biologically confirmed to be anti -SARS or anti -MERS coronavi rus in \nliterature and in Chinese herbal database We received 261 hits from conducting our search in the PubMed \ndatabase. After careful evaluation of the abstracts from these citations we downloaded and carefully analyzed \nthe full text of 23 highly relevant  papers. The natural compounds reported to have biologically confirmed anti -\ncoronavirus activity were identified and then compared to the ingredients listed in TCMSP. The result was 115 \noverlapping ingredients, which we used for further testing (Fig. 1).  \n \n3.2. Filtration of compounds selected by ADME The antiviral activities of the 115 natural compounds were \nreportedly confirmed with enzyme -based (cell -free) or cell -based experimental systems. To be utilized as a \nChinese herbal medicine, they must be absor bable via oral prescription. Therefore, we performed ADME \nscreening for the 115 natural compounds, reducing the number of candidates to 13. 3.3. Docking between \nselected compounds and their reported targets To perform the docking analysis, the 3D structure  files of 2019 -\nnCoV PLpro, 3CLpro and spike proteins were built based on the corresponding SARS -CoV templates, i.e., PDB \n5e6j, 1uj1 and 6cad, respectively. Then, molecule -protein docking was carried out between the molecules and \ntheir reported targets. If the molecules were reported to inhibit viral entry, they were docked with spike \nproteins (Table 1). Each separate analysis returned positive results (Table 1, Fig. 2 and online supplementary \nFig. S1), indicating the natural compounds we selected might dire ctly inhibit 2019 -nCoV. The molecules \nselected to target PLpro (M2, M3, M7, M9, M10, M11 and M13) mainly bound in the region between the \nthumb and palm domains, which might interfere with substrate entering this enzyme\u2019s active sites, located at \nthe bottom  of the two domains [29]. The molecules reported to inhibit 3CLpro (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M7, \nM8, M10, M11, M12 and M13) mainly entered the region between domains 2 and 3, and this region is \nimportant for 3CLpro to form a dimmer [30]. M6 was reported to inhi bit viral entry, accordingly it bound the \nfusion cone of spike protein; this cone structure is important for viral membrane fusion [31] (Fig. 2 and online \nsupplementary Fig. S1).  \nTable  \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           125 \n   \n3.4. Selection of antiviral herbal plants The 13 molecules passing the three -round selection process were then \ncompared to the three Chinese herbal databases, and we found 230 herbs containing these molecules (online \nsupplementary file Table S1). We then evaluated these herbs for those containing 2 or more of the 13 natur al \ncompounds, leaving 125 results. We cross -referenced the 125 results with the classic categorizations for \nherbal usage in the TCMSP database, finally choosing 11 types that are traditionally used to treat viral \nrespiratory infections. There are 26 herbal  plants within the 11 types. The timeframe during the course of a \nviral infection that each of these 26 herbal plants (Table 2) should be used was also documented by seeking \nadvice from senior practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine. For example, pla nts catalogued as antipyretic \ndetoxifying drugs, qi -reinforcing drugs, antitussive antiasthmatics, pungent cool diaphoretics and phlegm -\nresolving medicines may all be used throughout the course of infection, whereas drugs belonging to the \ninterior warming group may be best utilized in prevention.  \n \n3. 5. Network analysis of possible effects or mechanisms Each of the potentially effective herbal remedies \ncontains many ingredients in addition to the antiviral ones found here. To evaluate the possible general in vivo \neffects of each of our identified herbs, we used the ADME indices listed above to examine each of the orally \nabsorbable and drug -like ingredients recorded in the TCMSP database for each plant. We then extracted the \ntarget proteins for each ingredie nt which had passed the screening process. All proteins belonging to a single \nplant were combined as input on the online protein -protein interaction analysis server, String, to find the \npathway enrichment. For the 26 herbs, about 1/3 of the top 30 KEGG -enriched pathways (mean = 11) were \nrelated to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammatory reactions and hypoxia response, indicating that \nthey are potentially effective treatments for viral respiratory infection (Fig. 3 and online supplementary Fig. \nS2). Note that some of the herbal plants selected here had been reported to be effective for SARS -CoV \ninfection in 2003 (online supplementary Table S2).  \nThus, the general effects of each plant should be examined by combining the effects of all of the orally \nabsorbable and biologically active ingredients in it.  \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           126 \n  \n4. Discussion  \nIn this work, we undertook a multiple step selection process and screened out 26 herbal plants with a high \nprobability of directly inhibiting the novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV), possibly pro viding instant help in the \nprevention and treatment of the pneumonia that it can cause. While mainly in China at this point, viral spread \nis ongoing and has affect persons worldwide. Two principles guided our screening work. The first is that the \nanti-coro navirus (2019 -nCoV) components contained in the source plants should be absorbable via oral \nprescription. This principle requires that the herbs selected should contain biologically proven anti -coronavirus \n(2019 -nCoV) ingredients, and that these natural co mpounds should pass the drug -likeness and oral \nbioavailability evaluations. Therefore, we conducted a three -step screening process. First, we extracted \nnatural compounds verified in PubMed as being effective in treating SARS or MERS coronavirus and then cr oss-\nchecked these compounds in the Chinese herbal databases. There were 115 overlapping compounds. This \nmethod was an expeditious way to identify natural components both pre -existing in Chinese herbal treatment \nand having a high possibility of anti -coronav irus (2019 -nCoV) activity. This is important, as the anti -coronavirus \neffects of the selected compounds have been biologically confirmed, and the genetic similarities between \ncoronavirus (2019 -nCoV) and SARS or MERS coronavirus are high [24,25]. The anti -coronavirus effects of the \nnatural compounds screened by the above method have been mainly confirmed in vitro by direct loading onto \ncultured cells, thus it does not guarantee their effectiveness in vivo, especially with oral preparation \u2014the \nprincipal way i n which Chinese herbals are administered. Therefore, to meet the first principle, we ran ADME \nfilters on the natural compounds selected by 4 indices, as used by Hu et al [26]. Among the 115 compounds \nhighlighted by our first step, only 13 passed this scree ning, showing the necessity of such a test. The novel \ncoronavirus has some mutations when compared to SARS or MERS coronavirus, so the natural compounds \neffectiveness against the two previous coronaviruses might not be present in the new virus. To reduce t his \nrisk, and as the third step of our first principle, we reconstructed the 3D structure of the new coronavirus using \nthe reported structures of SARS and MERS coronavirus proteins as a guide, and then used molecular docking \ntechnology to simulate whether the 13 natural compounds selected could combine with the structures we \nconstructed for the new coronavirus proteins. All 13 compounds could bind to the proteins as predicted for \nthe new coronavirus. We believe that the high success rate of our docking scre ening was due to the high \ngenetic similarity between the new coronavirus and the SARS or MERS virus [24,25]. Our second principle for \nscreening should also be emphasized and elaborated upon. It states that the selected herbal plants must \nconform to traditi onal usages. There are many kinds of Chinese herbs that have been used for thousands of \nyears. Based on this rich history and experience, Chinese herbal medicines are divided into different types, \neach type dedicated to certain kinds of diseases. Ignoring these grouping guidelines can lead to serious side \neffects. Therefore, as a further condition for the medicine screened here, we verified that they have been \nroutinely used to treat viral pneumonia. To meet this principle, we conducted another three -step s creening \nprocess for the herbal plants. First, we searched the Chinese medicine database for herbs containing the 13 \nnatural compounds identified. Herbs containing at least 2 of these potentially useful compounds were \nselected, and a total of 125 herbal pl ants were identified. The second step in targeted plant selection was \nbased on type classification. Of the 125 results, only 26 herbs were found to be routinely used in treating viral \nrespiratory infection. Finally, network pharmacological analysis was per formed to predict the possible \ntherapeutic effects of these 26 plants. Because Chinese herbal medicines contain many ingredients, and \n \n \nTratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19  |  Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC                           127 \n multiple absorbable ingredients might exert their effects on the body, the general effects of herbs may be \ndictated by all  of the absorbable ingredients they contain. With this consideration in mind, we extracted the \nrecorded ingredients of each of the plants selected from the Chinese medicine database and screened these \ningredients for drug -likeness and oral availability (vi a ADME filter) [26,32]. The target proteins of all ingredients \npassing ADME selection were used for network enrichment to predict the general effects of the herbal plants. \nFor all the plants analyzed, nearly half of the top 30 pathways enriched in KEGG are  related to antiviral , \nimmune/inflammatory responses and hypoxia response indicating that these herbs are suitable for anti -viral \nusage. In fact, some of the herbal plants selected here had been reported effective in against SARS -CoV \ninfection in 2003 (on line supplementary Table S2). We thought that the general antiviral and \nimmune/inflammation effects predicted for the 26 plants are correlated with the fact that these plants were \nselected according to Chinese herbal type classifications. Of course, it sho uld be pointed out that Chinese \nherbs that have not been identified through this screening process may still have beneficial effects. Further, \nconsidering that the biologically validated natural compounds reported in the literature cannot cover all \nantivir al natural compounds, and the natural compounds included in the Chinese medicine database are not \ncomplete, the process that we have followed may have excluded herbs that would be well suited to this \ntreatment. Nevertheless, the purpose of this screening w as to provide a rational approach for selecting \nChinese herbal medicines with a high potential efficacy in treating 2019 -nCoV and related viruses. The specific \ndosage and usage of each herb should be determined based on patients\u2019 manifestations. Finally, t he key step \nin this screening was molecular docking. The 3D structures of the proteins used here are based on reported \ngene sequences. If the virus mutates during transmission, a new screening is recommended. In conclusion, \nthis work has identified several  Chinese medicinal plants classified as antiviral/pneumonia -effective that might \ndirectly inhibit the novel coronavirus, 2019 -nCoV. Additionally, we propose screening principles and methods \nwhich may provide guidance in screening antiviral drugs from other  natural drug databases.  \nAuthors\u2019 contributions  \nDZ conceived the study, participated in its design, coordination, and all the work processes.
