The investigation is focused on the \ndevelopment of monitors based on the EEG , once it is known that an esthetic drugs \naffect both cerebral physiology and EEG patterns . Similarly t he EEG could be \nconsidered a promisi ng physiological signal  to assess the depth of anesthesia in dogs, \nsince there are changes in the EEG patterns during increasing hypnotic concentrations. \nHowever until now none of the current  monitors developed for humans seems to have \nthe capabilit y to detect accurately the variation in drug  concentrations and in clinical \nendpoints.  \n \nThe main objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of the human Cerebral \nState Index (CSI ) during anesthesia with propofol in dogs.  This monitor  uses EEG as \nthe input variable, which is analysed with fuzzy logic  to process data.  The f uzzy logic \nanalysis is a problem -solving control system methodology that incorporates a simple,  \nruled -based\u201d IF X and Y then Z approach for  solving a control problem , rather than \nattempting to model a system mathematically. Thus, t his mathematical algorithm used \nin this equipment seems to be, among other developed hypnotic monitors used in \nhumans, the one that may yield better performance in quantifying depth of anesthe sia in \ndogs.  \nThe monitor also analyse s the Burst suppression ratio ( BSr) whic h is defined as the \npercentage of time in 30 -s window where the amplitude of  the electroencephalographic \nsignal was less than 3.5\u00b5 V. These EEG periods characteriz e the deepest lev els of \nhypnosis . \n \nAll studies were performed  at Porto  Veterinary Hospital.  All dogs came from an  \nadoption program established between local animal shelters  and the Porto  Hospital. The \nstudies were prepared with h ealthy dogs undergoing scheduled routine surgical  \nprocedures . \nThe study  was performed in three phases aiming at evaluating  the performance of the \nCSM monitor during anesthesia with propofol .  6 \n In all phases the  Beth\u2019s pharmacokinetic model for propofol was incorporated in \nRuggloop \u00ae software , which  was used to drive the propofol infusion. This was done \naccording to the desired propofol plasma target. The software also provided the \nestimated propofol plasma concentration achieved in the blood.  The EEG was collected \nby three electrodes placed in speci fic positions in the head thereafter EEG  signal is \nconverted by the Cerebral State Monitor into the CSI . \n \nIn the first phase (chapter 3.1) , the performance of the CSM monitor was evaluated after \nthe administration of a propofol bolus dose of 6mg/kg.  The cerebral electrical changes \ninduced by increasing propofol concentrations in the dogs were  detected by the cerebral \nstate index ( CSI), displayed by the CSM . The next step to evaluate the CSI  is to find the \naccuracy of the monitor when correlated with  clinical endpoints.  \n \nIn the second phase (chapter 3.2) , it was introduced the clinical end points, ocular \nreflexes position of the eyeball  to evaluate the performance of the CSM monitor in dogs \nduring inductio n of anesthesia  with propofol. F ive anesthetic planes , classified from A \nto E, were proposed based ocular on reflexes and position of the eyeball. During \ninduction of anesthesia at 200mlh-1 it was o bserved a high correlation between the \nestimated propofol plasma concentrations  (PropCp) and the clinical endpoints observed . \nHowever the performance of CSM was not consistent with the clinical observations on \nthe different planes of depth of anesthesia . This results pointed CSM potential use \nlimit ation  during routine induction of veterinary anesthesia . \n \nIn the third phase of the study (Chapter 3.3), the CSI and the previously identified \nanesthetic  planes were studied during different steady -state propofol plasma \nconcentrations, for  5 minutes  each. It was observed a good correlation between Pro pCp \nand the anesthetic planes . Despite of a better  correlation between CSI, Pro pCp and \nanesthetic planes  than in the studies above , the CSI showed several limitations because  \nit was not able to  clearly distinguish  among the anesthetic planes . Nevertheless the CSI \nwas able to detect very deep planes of anesthesia  when BSR occurs. These  findings \ncould compromise the use of CSI  in dogs .  \n \nIn conclusion the CSM showed important clinical limitations during induction and in  \nthe maintenance of anesthesia  during routine an esthetic procedures with propofol in 7 \n dogs . Nevertheless, it seems that CSM is able to detect deeper levels of anesthesia  when \nburst suppression occurs. The burst suppression rate was consistent in deep planes of \nanesthesia , which may be of relevance when considering the development of future  \nFuzzy logic based EEG monitors . \n  8 \n Resumen.  \nEn los \u00faltimos 20 -30 a\u00f1os, los avances en la tecnolog\u00eda inform\u00e1tica permiten la \nutilizaci\u00f3n de complejas t\u00e9cnicas de modelizaci\u00f3n estad\u00edstica del electroencefalograma \n(EEG) co n el fin de generar una escala num\u00e9rica \u201c\u00edndice\u201d para evaluar la profundidad \nanest\u00e9sica y ayudar a los m\u00e9dicos anestesistas humanos.  \nNuestro objetivo en esta memoria de tesis doctoral es el desarrollo de un \u00edndice \nbasado en los patrones del electroencefalo grama producidos por alteraciones en el \nfisiolog\u00eda cerebral cuando el animal esta anestesiado, y relacionarlos con la profundidad \nanest\u00e9sica. Es decir la utilizaci\u00f3n del encefalograma para evaluar la profundidad \nanest\u00e9sica, ya que hasta ahora ninguno de lo s signos cl\u00ednicos que utilizamos puede, de \nforma cuantitativa, relacionarse con la profundidad anest\u00e9sica.  \nEn este trabajo realizamos la anestesia general con propofol en perros sanos a los \nque se les somete a una cirug\u00eda de orquitectom\u00eda, y que provienen de sociedades \nprotectoras que tienen convenios con el Hospital Veterinario de Oporto (Portugal).  \nSe emplea el Electroencefalograma como variable de entrada, que es analizada \ncon l\u00f3gica difusa para procesar los datos. El algoritmo matem\u00e1tico que utiliza est e \nequipo, parece ser que es el m\u00e1s adecuado para intentar obtener los \u00edndices que nos \nmidan la profundidad anest\u00e9sica.  \nEn todos los estudios del  trabajo de tesis doctoral, se incorpor\u00f3 el modelo \nfarmacocin\u00e9tico del propofol desarrollado por Beths, T y col . 2001, mediante el \nRuggloop software, que nos proporciona la estimaci\u00f3n de la concentraci\u00f3n plasm\u00e1tica \nde propofol en sangre.  \nCon el fin de evaluar el rendimiento del \u201cCerebral State Monitor\u201d, a parato que \ndetecta el efecto de los anest\u00e9sicos sobre el cere bro, recogiendo y procesando la \nactividad el\u00e9ctrica cerebral, y convirtiendo esta se\u00f1al el\u00e9ctrica, a trav\u00e9s de algoritmos \nmatem\u00e1ticos, en un \u00edndice reconocible, se realiz\u00f3 el estudio en tres fases:  \n1\u00aa fase. - Se administr\u00f3 un bolo de propofol de 6 mg. /Kgpv . Los cambios de la \nactividad el\u00e9ctrica cerebral  fueron cuantificados mediante el c\u00e1lculo del \u00edndice de \nestado cerebral. (Artic ulo \u201cBrain monitoring in dogs using the cerebral state index \nTuring the induction of anesthesia  via target -controlled infusi\u00f3n o f propofol\u201d).  \n2\u00aa fase. - Se administro propofol en infusi\u00f3n constante de 200 ml/hora en \nconcentraci\u00f3n del 1%. En este trabajo se introdujeron los signos cl\u00ednicos, reflejos \noculares, posici\u00f3n del globo ocular, etc. con el fin de observar la correlaci\u00f3n entre  las 9 \n concentraciones plasm\u00e1ticas estimadas de propofol y los signos cl\u00ednicos observados \ndurante la inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia. Sin embargo el rendimiento del \u201cCerebral State \nMonitor\u201d, no se corresponde con las observaciones cl\u00ednicas en los diferentes planos  de \nprofundidad anest\u00e9sica. (Arti culo \u201cCorrelation between clinical signs of depth of \nanesthesia  and cerebral state index responses in dogs during induction of anesthesia  \nwith propofol\u201d).  \n3\u00aa fase. - Se eval\u00faa el \u201c\u00cdndice de Estado cerebral\u201d (CSI) medido por el \u201cCerebral \nState Monitor\u201d (CSM) en perros anestesiados con diferentes concentraciones de \npropofol. Se demostr\u00f3 que a pesar de que hay una mayor correlaci\u00f3n entre el CSI y los \nplanos de profundidad anest\u00e9sica, no siempre se pod\u00edan  distinguir unos planos \nanest\u00e9sicos de otros. (Articulo \u201cCorrelation between clinical signs of depth of \nanesthesia  and cerebral state index responses in dog with different target -controlled \ninfusions of propofol\u201d).  \nEn conclusi\u00f3n la utilizaci\u00f3n de monitores de profundidad anest\u00e9si ca puede \nguiarnos en la dosificaci\u00f3n de anest\u00e9sicos, evitando la sobre dosificaci\u00f3n y reduciendo \ncostes y efectos secundarios, pero el CSM mostr\u00f3 limitaciones cl\u00ednicas importantes \ndurante la evaluaci\u00f3n de la inducci\u00f3n y mantenimiento de la anestesia en \nprocedimientos rutinarios de anestesia en perros, aunque si permite detectar alertas en \nplanos profundos de anestesia.  \n \n \n  10 \n Index   \n \nAgradecimentos  ................................ ................................ ................................ ........  3 \nAbstract  ................................ ................................ ................................ ....................  5 \nResumen.  ................................ ................................ ................................ ..................  8 \nIndex  ................................ ................................ ................................ .......................  10 \nIndice  ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................  15 \nIndex of Tables  ................................ ................................ ................................ ....... 18 \nIndex of Figures  ................................ ................................ ................................ ...... 19 \nGlossary  ................................ ................................ ................................ ..................  22 \nChapter 1  ................................ ................................ ................................ ....................  24 \nIntroduction  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................  24 \n1.1-Depth of anesthe sia: What have we been monitoring?

and the controversy about the reliability  \nin veterinary anesthesia  thwarts  the development and routine use of  monitors of  depth of \nanesthesia . In an attempt to facilita te the understanding of the role played by monitors \nof depth of anesthesia, this first chapter addresses the main issues regarding the use of \nthat tool in common v eterinary practice.  During this discussion special attention is \ndevot ed to the dog the target  specie  from this thesis.  \n1.1-Depth of anesthesia: What have we been monitoring?  \n1.1.1 -History  \nThe dogs had a great value in development of intravenous anesthesia . In 1657 , Sir \nChristopher Wren the famous arch itect, carried  out the first experiments at  Duc de \nBordeux `s house . Wren  ligated the veins of a large  dog, made an opening on the side of \nthe ligature toward the heart  and introduce d the syringe in this opening. The syringe was \nmade off animal bladder , to which a quill had been attached , and filled  with a opium \nsolution in one case and crocus metallorum  in another. This experiment revealed that \nopium administered intravenously \u201csoon stupefied \u201c (probably a deep sedation)  but did \nnot kill the dog. Sir Wren was certainly unconscious of his anesthetic  result from \nadministering opium . On the contrary , when the crocus metallorum  was administered , it \ninduced the vomiting and caused death. (First Lieut Keys 1942)  (Refer ence Librarian, \nMayo clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, reviewed by War Manuscript Board) .  \nThe classical concept of anesthesia  described by Pinsker (Pinsker 1986)  incorporated \nimmobility (absence of movement or skeletal muscle tone), unconsciousness  and the \nattenuation of stress response (heart rate and blood pressure) to painful stimulus, that \nreflects analgesia are the main three components of anesthesia.  \n 25 \n  \nFigure 1 -Represents the classical components of anesthesia  \n \nPry-Roberts  (Prys -Roberts 1987)  defined anesthesia  as a state in which an individual is \nincapable to perceive or recall a noxious stimulus a s a result of drug unconsciousness.  \nIn veterinary patients the objective of anesthesia is to promote reversible \nunconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia and immobility with minimal risk to the animal  \n(Haskins 1996) . When dogs are an esthetized, un consciousness  is expected . But does it \nalways  occur ? Veterinary a nesthesia undoubtedly induces unresponsiveness and \namnesia . Nevertheless, the extent to which it causes unconsciousness  is harder to \nestablish. The present knowledge of mechanisms that produce unconsciousness is very \nlimited in humans , and even more limited in animals.  \nIn order to better understand consciousness in humans, it was separated from memory , \nand memory  itself  was separated in two forms : implicit and explicit. Consciousness is \ndefined as the capability to execute simple motor task s in response to a verbal \ncommand ;  explicit memory is the capability to recall events or words ; implicit memory \nrepresents part of the subconscious and normally is related with changes in performance \nor behaviour  (Rampil 2001) . Whe n applying these concepts to veterinary anesthesia , it \nis easy to see that veterinarians do not face an easy task. As owners sometimes report  \nchanges in the behaviour of their animal  after the surgical procedures , this could lead us \nto thinking that these changes could be related to a surgical awareness.  Nevertheless \nthere are several  factors that can be associated with  these behavioural changes,  since the \nenvironment  and medical procedures are traumatic experiences, in different grades, for \nthe patients . . In fact, anaesthesia can\u00b4t be detached from surgery and its implications. \nPrior to this, there is one main question that is worth addressing:  \n26 \n 1.1.2 -How deep are our veterinary patients  anesthetized ? \nThat question still goes on  puzzling as time goes by  because the  concept of de ep \nanaesthesia is dimensionless . Some reports , on human medical literature refer to the \ndifficult y that teachers have  to explain the students how deep  anesthetized  the patient  is. \n \u201cThe experienced teacher, not ing that patient appear s to be clinically satisfactory, \noften says the patient is in the second plane and walks away before he is asked to \nexplain how he arrived at this decision \u201d(Jacoby, Hamelberg et al. 196 0) . \nSince the anesthesia  was first introduced during  the last century, multiple sugges tions \nwere introduced in order  to characterize the depth of anesthesia , and consequently the \namount of the drug that should be administer ed to the patient.  \nThe depth of anesthesia has been  evaluated based on cli nical changes in blood pressure , \nheart rate, pulse  rate, ocular signs, muscular tonus and respiration  (Cullen, Eger et al. \n1972) . Interestingly enough, back in 1960, ,  experienced anesthesiologists   claimed  that \nthe most important sign to observe in anesthetized patients is respiration , as many \nanaesthesiologists control led the amount of drugs given in accordance to changes in \nventilation  (Jacoby, Hamelberg et al. 1960) .  \nDespite of the possibility of using  the ventilation to access the depth of anesthesia  in \nveterinary , because most of the patients are anesthetized without ne uromuscular \nblocking agents, the breathing rate may also be a sensitive indicator of more  underlying \nproblem s. There are a lot of physiologic events like hypoxemia, hyperthermia, \nhypotension, atelectasis  and pain that can affect the breathing rate (Haskins 1996) .  \nThe references in veterinary literature (Haskins 1992; Lumb and Jones 1996; Hall, \nClarke et al. 2001)  related to depth of anesthesia  are normally  extrapolated from human \nanesthesia . Guedel , in 1937 (Guedel 1937)  described the classical signals of ether \nanesthesia  for humans, which have been applied to animals in a first effort to \ncharacterized the depth of anesthesia  (Soma 1971; Hall, Clarke et al. 2001) . This \nevaluation of depth of anesthesia  was based on observation of ocular reflexes , muscle \ntone, and respiration. Haskins described a variety of signs that can be helpful to evaluate \nthe depth of anesthesia  in dogs (Table  1) (Haskins 1992) . \n  27 \n Table 1 - General guidelines for judging anesthetic depth .  \nSigns  Light  Medium  Deep  \nSpontaneous movement  Maybe/unlike  No No \nReflex movement  Yes/maybe  No No \nHemodynamic responses  Yes Maybe/no  No \nVaporizer settings  Low  1.1 to  1.5 MAC  Hight  \nMuscle tone  High/good  Moderate  None  \nPalpebral reflex  Yes No No \nEyeball position  Central  Ventromedial  Central  \nLight reflex  Yes Maybe  No \nMoist c\u00f3 rneas  Yes Yes No \nPupil aperture  Medium  Smaller  Dilated  \nShivering  Maybe  No No \nOpinions in Small Animal Anesthesia in Veterinary Clinics of North America . Adapted from Haskings, \nS.C. (1992).  \n \nBurge and colleagues (1943 ), reported s pontaneous movement s in dogs anaesthetised \nwith ether,  which can  be associated to a light or inadequate anesthesia . Nevertheless, \nthese observations were reported repeatedly in the same dog . Under the same \nconditions, the same authors observed in different dogs  that by decreasing the depth of \nanesthesia , the negative potential of the  brain\u00b4s motor cortex  would increase the \nprobability of spontaneous movements  (Burge 1943) . Nevertheless, in humans \u2019 studies \nthe high percentage of spontaneous movement is not correlated with a post -operatively \nrecall  (Stolzy, Couture et al. 1987) . There are numerous reasons that could promote  \nmovement during surgery , including not just light anesthesia , but insufficient muscle \nrelaxation, patient respiratory effort , cardiac function (ballisticcardiographic forces) , \nmechanical ventilation and direct electrocautery stimulation  (Adragna 1986) . \nHaskings (Haskins 1992)  described  that a gross spontaneous movement , or a reflex \nmovement are reliable sign s of light anesthesia .However , Antognini and Schwartz \ndemonstrated that with volatile anesthetics the concentration to produce amnesia and \nunconsciousness is around 25 -40% of the needs to inhibit purposeful movement  \n(Antognini and Schwartz 1993) .Similar  findings were observed for propofol action at \nthe lumbar dorsal spinal cord  (Antognini, Wang et al. 2000) . Thus, it is reasonable to \nsuggest that purposeful  movement by itself cannot be used as an indicator of level of \ndepth of anesthesia , as anesthesia  is a resul t of simultaneous actions at different sites in \ncentral nervous system . \nThe evaluation of depth  of anesthesia  in veterinary practice  also depends on  the \nautonomic responses to the noxious stimulus. The m inimum alveolar concentration 28 \n (MAC ) was first describ ed by Merkel and Eger  (Merkel and Eger 1963) , and is by \ndefinition the steady minimum alveolar concentration of anesthetic  required to prevent \npurposeful movement in 50% of animals  population , in response to a selected noxious \nstimulation  (Merkel and Eger 1963) . Therefore, and as exposed in the last paragraph \nregarding the percentage of hypnotic to produce unconsciousness, using MAC as a \nsingle method to evaluate the depth of anesthesia  would probably yield in excessive \nanesthetic  administration, because its definition was based on purposeful movement . If \none wants  to abolish the movement the patient must be maintained under excessive  \nlevels of anesthesia  (Whelan and Flecknell 1992) . \nThe degree of muscle relaxation was also  frequently used to monitor the depth of \nanesthesia . In 1937 , Hendersoh and colleagues  provided a  simple description of \nmuscular tonus under ether anesthesia . According to those authors, i n early stages of \nanesthesia  the higher nervous centres are depressed,  but the lower motor centres are not \ninhibited , leading to an increase in the muscular tonus ; on the other hand, in deep stages \nof anesthesia , the lower motor centre s are also depressed,  causing a diminished  nerve \ndischarge, lead ing to muscle relax ation  and absence of muscular tonus  (Hendersoh \n1937) . \n During routine anesthetic  procedures, the muscular tonus in  veterinary patients is \nestimated by the resistance  to open the mouth or eyelids. This clinical evaluation may \nbecome very subjective if we attend to the fact muscular tonus is influenced by the size \nof the patients (larger dogs have more tonus ), and  in some  dogs it is almost impossible \nto detect the presence of mandib ular tonus  due, for example, to their very small size.  \nThus, in an ideal situation, veterinarians should be able to quantify the muscular tonus \nfor each individual patient, but even then, musc ular tonus would not be an objective \nmeasure ment  of the depth o f anesthesia  (Haskins 1992) . \nOcular refle xes and eyeball position are two  of the most used s igns to a ccess the depth \nof anesthesia  in veterinary patients. In 1966 Guedel and colleagues reported that the \neyeball is one of the most important signs in anesthesia  at that time .  \nAs long as the eyeball is oscillating or is in an eccentric position though stationary, \nthere is no danger that too much ether has been given. A side from extraneous \ncircumstances, such as positional asphyxia, haemorrhage, or shock, if the eyeball is \nmoving or is stationary but eccentric, the patient is safe and in a good condition (Guedel \n1966) .  29 \n In veterinary anesthesia  the eye ball movements are similar with thiopental, propofol, \nhalothane and isoflurane . When increas ing from light to moderate anesthesia , the \neyeball rotat es ventromedia lly or ventrolatera lly, returning to a central position in \ndeeper level s of anesthesia  (Hall, Clarke et al. 2001) . However, there are some  animal s \nin which  the eyeball position never changes (Haskins 1992) , this  is a very important fact \nto bear when one only uses  this method to access anesthetic  depth . Although the pupil \nsize is also observed when analysing the eyeball position, there are many  variations \nbetween individuals, and consequently it is not a reliable sign itself that can provide \naccurately information regarding the level of anesthetic  depth (Haskins 1992) .  \nThe palpebral  reflex , defined by the  partial or complete closure of the eyelids , is a \ncommonly  useful tool to help monito ring the depth of anesthesia . Its occur rence means \nthat the patient is under a light plan of an aesthesia . If palpebral reflex is absent or \ndepressed,  the patient could be in a medium to a deep level of anesthesia  (Hall, Clarke \net al. 2001) . The corneal reflex may also be used to help determining the depth of \nanesthesia . A corneal reflex is the eyelid response obtained to a careful and gentle touch \nin the cornea, and should  not cause any corneal  damage. This reflex causes some \ncontroversy  regardin g its usefulness in acc essing the depth of anesthesia . So me \nveterinary anaesthesiologists refer that cor neal reflex is not a sign of deep  anesthesia  \n(Hall, Clarke et al. 2001) , while others  report  that this  reflex should always be present , \nunless the patient is too deep anaesthetised or dead . The absence of moist cornea may \nalso be considered as a sign of an excessive depth of anesthesia  (Haskins 1992) .  \nAs hypnot ic drugs also depress the autonomic nervous system, it is expected that t he \nheart rate and blood pressure decrease , when the level of anesthetic  depth  increases  \n(Flaishon, Windsor et al. 1997) . Nevertheless, these auton omic signs can be influence d \nby several physiological events, such as noxious stimulation or hypo/hyperperfusion \nsituations. Combinations of analgesic and hypnotic drugs, such as propofol and opioids, \ncan also by themselves cause hemodynamic  depression unr elated to the depth of \nanesthesia  (Hug 1990) . Thus, although these variables are very important for monitoring \nand maintaining the patient\u2019s health condition under general anesthesia , they cannot be \nconsidered by themselves indicators of the level of depth of anesthesia . \nAccording to the previous paragraphs, in order to have a safe and reliable monitoring of \nthe depth of anesthesia , veterinarians should not rely on any particular sign , but use as \nmuch information as possible from the visual interaction with the patient, and from \nhemodynamic  monitors. There is one study that produce d a visual analogue scale (VAS) 30 \n for pigs (Martin -Cancho, Lima et al. 2003)  based on the clinical experience of the \nresearchers , and on the information suggested in Lumb & Jones Veterinary Anesthesia  \n(Lumb and Jones 1996)  (Table 2). \n  31 \n Table 2-Variables  used to access depth of anesthesia  in pigs  (Martin -Cancho, Lima et al. 2 003).  \nAnesthetic  planes  \nVariables  1 2 3 4 5 \nConscious  Yes No No No No \nBreathing Rate  Normal  Irregular and \nIncrease  Moderately \ndecrease  Moderately \ndecrease  Slow and \nirregular  \nTypes of \nbreathing  Thoracic and \nabdominal  Thoracic and \nabdominal  Thoracic and \nabdominal  Thoracic but \npredominantly \nabdominal  Abdominal  \nPupil  Normal  Dilated  Normal  Moderately \ndilated  Dilated  \nEyeball Position  Normal  Variable  Fixed \nventromedially  Normal  Normal  \nHeart Rate  Normal  Increased  Moderately \ndecrease  Moderately \ndecrease  Decreased  \nArterial blood \npressure  Normal  Increased  Normal  Decreased  Decreased  \nPalpebral reflex  Weak response  Strong response  Weak response  Not detected  Not detected  \nCorneal reflex  Weak response  Strong response  Weak response \nor not detected  Weak response \nor not detected  Not detected  \nPedal reflex  Strong response  Strong response  Weak response  Not detected  Not detected  \nMuscular tone  Yes Yes Decreased  Decreased  Not detected  \nNocioceptive \nresponse  Strong response  Strong response  Weak response  Not detected  Not detected  \nBispectral index, spectral edge frequency 95%, and median frequency recorded for various concentrations \nof isoflurane and sevoflurane in pigs . Adapted from Martin -Cancho  and colleagues (Martin -Cancho, \nLima et al. 2003) . 32 \n   \n1.2- Why do we need monitors to ass ess the depth of anesthesia?  \n \nThe depth  of anesthesia is usually determin ed by the response measured to a certain \nstimulus, and by the amount of drug required in the effect site to blunt the \nresponsiveness  (Stanski 2000) . But this evaluation depends on the subjective assessment  \nof the  reflex physiological response (heart rate and blood pressure)  to the ongoing \nprocedure . Addi tionally, and as the anesthetic drugs have different physiologic \nresponses, it is  extremely important to have a detailed knowledge of mechanism of \naction of different drugs used in anesthesia , in order to more accurately interpret the \nclinical signs (Haskins 1992) . \nThe major  goal in veterinary and human anesthesia is to quantify the depth of anesthesia  \nand, at the same time, to evalua te the level of unconsciousness that cannot be measure d \nobjectively.  An increased accuracy of the process of measuring the  depth of anesthesia  \nwould be a huge step towards the standardization  of anesthetic practice in institutional \nanimal care, in clinical p ractice and in research aiming at  guarant ying an adequate \nanesthetic protocol  and less variation between individuals.  \nSome reflex response may be masked by the use of neuromuscular blocking agents , \ndespite the fact that these  are not currently used in veterinary practice, its use may \nincrease as surgical techniques evolve and require more accurate anesthetic procedures. \nThe introduction of devices that can monitor the depth of  anesthesia in paralyzed \nanimal s reduce s the chanc e of intraoperat ive awareness , or of overdos ing the patient  \n(Martin-Cancho, Carrasco -Jimenez et al. 2004) . \nIn humans , the occurrence of awareness during surgery is of great concern  because this  \nvery traumatic  experience may lead to  a completely change of personality,  making \nliving a nightmare for th ese patients  (Bruhn, Myles et al. 2006) . In veterinary \nanest hesia , the occurrence and the consequences of awareness are difficult to establish  \n(Haskins 1996) , but it  does not mean that is not frequent .  \nDespite of the remarkable improvements in the assessment of the cardiovascular \nfunction  during anesthesia, the direc t determination of the effect of the anesthetic \nagent(s) on the central nervous system has remained a challenge (Moerman, Bonke et \nal. 1993) .  There are studies in humans that  refer the aware ness of the patient when the \nhemodynamic parameters remain stable (Flaishon, Windsor et al. 1997) .  33 \n Wetze l and colleagues demonstrated  significant hemodynamic responses to surgical \nstimuli  in patients with undoubtedly criteria of brain death  (Wetzel, Setzer et al. 1985) . \nThe same principles are applied to veterinary anesthesia  (Hall, Clarke et al. 2001) ,  \nbut the veterinary ane sthetists have few alternatives to monitor the depth of anesthesia \nbesides  monitoring the autonomic parameters. The cardiovascular signs of anesthesia \nappear to be a balance between sympathetic stimulation and the direct depressant effects \nof anesthesia. It is difficult to evaluate the depth of anesthesia based on the autonomic \nactivity,  as some agents like  CO 2, can influence such activity  (Cullen, Eger et al. 1972) . \nIt is possible that unnecess ary anesthetic overdose may occur during veterinary \nanesthesia, when only monitoring hemodynamic parameters (Whelan and Flecknell \n1992) . The development of a depth of anesthesia  monitor has faced the problems related \nwith the fact that t here is no single clinical measurement that include s all anesthetic \ndrugs used in current general anesthesia,  because different  drugs have different  \npharmacologic action s, and sometimes different physiological responses. This  makes \nvery difficult to determine the potency of a certain drug using just one monitoring \nparameter (Kissin 2000) . For example, t he use of opioids like fentanyl can alter the \nheart rate, mean arterial pressure and cate colamine response during isoflu rane and \ndesflurane anesthesia  (Hilgenber g 1981; Daniel, Weiskopf et al. 1998) . If we consider \nthat balanced anesthe sia uses the combination of different drugs, with different effects, \nto achieve a more stable and safe level of anesthesia, monitoring these anesthetic \nprocedures require additional clinical information, where brain activity is one of the \nmost important pa rameters.  Many anesthesiologists confess that sometimes they have \ndifficulties in administrating more or less of a particular drug, as balanced anesthesia is \na more difficult technique to learn, despite being associated with several advantages \n(Jacoby, Hamelberg et al. 1960) . \nThe brain electrical activity has an important relevance to assess the depth of anesthesia. \nThe EEG is a non  invasive indicator of the cerebral function during ge neral anesthesia , \nas it represents co rtical activity based on the sum  of postsynaptic activity . New \ncomputer analysis can process the EEG to give us valuable information about the level \nof unconsciousness.  \nCurrently , the veterinary anesthesia use s a multi modal anesthesia monitoring approach. \nHemodynamic and respiratory parameters and muscle  routinely controlled during \nanesthesia.  However,  the level of consciousness remains a challenge , the veterinary \nanesthesiologist s do not have a reliable  tool to monitor the \u201cbrain state\u201d.  34 \n  \n1.3- What is the origin of the EEG?  \n1.3.1 - The electrical activity in the brain.  \nThe EEG is by definition a recording of a spontaneous electrical activity of the cerebral \ncortex, and  it represents the net summation of electric currents produced by cerebral \nneurons (Rampil  1998) . The large pyramid of cells  arranged sides by side in the fifth \nlayer of the brain are  responsible for the neuronal source of the EEG. The long straight \napical dendrites, and neighboring dendrites have allowed the creation of dipoles in the \nneuro ns that cause currents to flow , which will have a greater effect on the surface \nelectro des (Rampil  1998; Bennett, Voss et al. 2009) . The EEG had no regular, repetitive \npatterns in shape of the EEG waveform,  and changes  randomly over time  (Rampil \n1998) .  \nIn veterinary anesthesia, the EEG raised increased interest in the nineteenth decade, \ndespite o f the large ongoing research in animals for human purposes that boasted since \nthe 19th century. In 1875 Caton  described the presence of electrical current in the brain \nusing a galvanometer  in rabbits and monkeys  (Caton 1875) . Hans Berger of Jena, the \n\u201cfather of electroencephalography\u201d, recorde d the electrical activity of the brain using \nelectrodes in the head surface (Berger 1933) . Nevertheless, the researchers have only \nstudied in 1937 the relationship between anesthesia and the EEG,  when Gibbs and \nLennox hypothesized that the electroencephalogram is  sensitive to anesthetic agents \n(Gibbs, Gibbs et al. 1937) . In the same year, Loomis and colleagues described \nsystematic changes of the EEG during human sleep, and were the first to describe  five \nanesthetic stages, A \u2013E, to distinguish different EEG patterns  (Loomis, Harvey et al. \n1937)  (Fig 2) . \n 35 \n  \nFigure 2-EEG patterns  \n(A) Represents an \u201cawake\u201d EEG with a high frequency and low amplitude of the waves. The  application \nof anesthetics, such as volatile anesthetics, barbiturates, etomidate and propofol induces comparable and \ndose-dependent changes in the raw EEG signals according to the following pattern. In low doses, \nanesthetics lead to a short -term high fre quency beta rhythm (B). With increasing anesthetic effect, a \nslowing of EEG frequency is observed, increasing theta and then delta activity, with a simultaneous \nincrease in amplitude (C to E). A further increase in anesthetic dose results in an increasing inhibition of \nthe electric activity until a flat EEG (suppression) is registered that is merely disturbed by short -term \nactivity bursts (F); this is called a \u2018burst suppression pattern\u2019.  \n \nIn veterinary anesthesia, the first reports associating  the EEG wit h anesthetic depth  \nwere introduced by Klem and Mallo in 1966 (Klemm and Mallo 196 6). The EEG is \nconsidered a possible measurement to assess the depth of anesthesia in dogs because \nthere are changes in the EEG patterns during anesthesia (Bergamasco, Accatino et al. \n2003) , that reflect  electrical activity related to physiological changes in cerebral \nmetabolism (Artru 1 986) and in cerebral blood flow (Kuramoto, Oshita et al. 1979; \nDong, Bledsoe et al. 1983) . Anesthetic drugs affect both cerebral physiology and EEG \npatterns.  \n36 \n The electroencephalographic signal is described  by using three basic  parameters:   \n \n1. Amplitude is the size, or voltage of the recorded signal and ranges from 5 \u03bcV to \n500 mV .  \n2. Frequency is the number of times per second the signal oscillates or crosses the \nzero voltage line (Stanski 2000) . It is very interesting that the fluctuations are in a \nrelatively  narrow range from 0.5 Hz to 50 Hz, with most of the frequencies below \n30 Hz  (Holliday and Colette 1999) . \n3. Time is the duration of the sampling of the signal. The set of sequential samples \nis named an epoch, and the collection of all possible epochs from an EEG is \nentitle ensemble (Rampil  1998) . The 2 seconds epochs have been recommended \nfor monitoring the patients\u2019 EEG during surgical procedures. The advantage of \naveraging the epochs is the reduction of the power spectrum variance. In \ncontrast the averaging could obliterate the characteristics of the EEG pattern \n(Levy, Shapiro et al. 1980) . Contamination of the signal could be introduced by \nartifact s frequencies produced by the abrupt transitions at the epochs\u2019 end \n(Rampil 1998) . Otto has been studying in dogs the effects of the different \naveraging on the EEG analysis in dogs and conclude that quantification EEG \nanalysis in response to noxious stimulation are significantly depending of the \nnumber of e pochs subjected to averaging. The average of 20 to 30 second period \ncould the best for detecting changes in EEG data when an intense noxious \nstimulus is applied (Otto 2007) . \n \nFrom the clinical point of view, fort unately the brain has the tendency to limit the \nvariation in the wave patterns observed in the normal wake EEG when the anesthetic \nagents are administered (Martin, Faulconer et al. 1959) . Traditionally, frequency bands \nare categorized in delta(\uf064)(0-4Hz), theta(\uf071)(4-8Hz), alpha(\u03b1)  (8-13Hz) and beta(\u03b2)  (13-\n30Hz)  (Rampil 1998) . The high frequencies \u03b1 and \u03b2  waves  predominate during the \nwaking  state,  and the slower \uf064 and \uf071 waves predominate during sleep or under \nanesthesia (Bennett, Voss et al. 2009) . Higher cortical activity normally promote s the \ndesynchroniz ation  of the EEG, and the neurons are active more independently, creating \nthe conscious behavior in humans. On the other hand the anesthetic agents promote the \nsynchronization of the cortical activity (Rampil  1998) . Desynchronization has been 37 \n described in laboratory animals when a noxious stimulus was applied (Antognini, \nCarstens et al. 2000) . One of the most interesting challenge in the analysis of EEG is the \neffect of the noxious stimulus on EEG monitoring during surgery (Otto 2008) . Noxious \nstimuli can cause four  types of changes in the EEG:  \n\uf0b7 Desynchronization with observation of fast rhythms (20- 60Hz ),  \n\uf0b7 Spindles 6 -10Hz and  \n\uf0b7 Bursts of slow waves 1 -3Hz.  \n\uf0b7 Synchronization  of the EEG  \nNevertheless in respons e to a noxious  stimulation , it can  occur a slowing of the EEG \nwave referred as synchronization  (Otto 2008) , also observe d in cats by Kaad and \ncolleagues (Kaada, Thomas et al. 1967) . Miyauchi and coll eagues described that sciatic \nstimulation in dogs has different effects on EEG, depending on the concentration of \npenthotal anesthesia. A distinct threshold  concen tration of thiopental seems to block the \nresponse to noxious stimuli during anesthesia in  animals  (Miyauchi, Sakabe et al. 1985) .  \nTo simplify,  any changes in EEG waveform due to a noxious stimulus should  be \ncarefully evaluated, as  it may indicate a perception of pain (Otto 2008) . \n \n1.3.2 -Artifacts  \nArtifact s entail  some  and ha ve to be taken in account when the EEG is analyzed.  There \nare different sources of artifacts:  \n1.3.2.1 Artifacts from outside the head   \nArtifacts from outside the head may include noise from electrical equipment, power line \nartifacts (which are the most impo rtant source of exogenous electrical artifact), external \npacemakers, electrocardiogram, diathermy surgical movement of the patient and \nhammering or drilling (Rampil 1998; Bennett, Voss et al. 2009) . \n1.3.2.2 -Artifacts from the head outside the brain  \nThe artifact  from the head but outside the brain is mainly the electromyography (EMG). \nThe frequency of EMG ranges from 10 -300Hz. It is known that EMG cannot be filtered  \nout completely, and for this reason could influence the analysis of the EEG (Ribeiro, \nFerreira et al. 2009) . Des pite the artifact effect of the EMG, the usefulness of this \nparameter as additional information about the anesthetic  state of the patient is 38 \n controversial (Bennett, Voss et al. 2009) . Campagnol and colleagues stud ies the effect \nin dogs  of a noxious produced by electrical stimulation . It was observed that after a \nstimulation the BIS increased significantly in all treatments, but it must be taken in \naccount that they founded a high correlation between  BIS and EMG, which lead to \ninterpret this results cautiously because  the changes in BI S may not be related to \nawareness  but to EMG response. (Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007)   \n \n1.3.2.3 - Artifact within the brain   \nThe artifacts with origin in the brain are not well described in veterinary anesthesia \nbecause it is very difficult to establish the alteration in EEG due to artifact that  are in the \nbrain, like: low amplitude of EEG sometimes provoked by analgesic or volatile agents, \nseizure activity and post -ictal state which can occur due abnormal physiology, cerebral \npathology or drugs, variable \uf064 activity during stable anesthesia unrel ated with surgical \nstimulation. Paradoxal \uf064 activity occurs in one third of the human patients, noxious \nstimulus may cause an increase in slow \uf064 waves  .Finally the cerebral pathology and \nsystemic problems,  namely, hypovolemia, hypoglycemia, and cardiac arr est could slow \nthe EEG waves (Bennett, Voss et al. 2009) . 39 \n 1.4 What are the principles to analyze EEG?   \n \nThe EEG is a  microvolt -range signal , thus  the quality and  consistency of the electrode  \nconnected  to the skin is  essential to  obtain a the reliable interpretation of the signa l \n(Rampil  1998) . \nIn 1959 Martin and Faulconner exposed the di fficulty in rec ording the EEG in  the surgery  \nroom, because the great amount of amplification necessary created an enormous amount of \nartifacts (Martin, Faulconer et al. 1959 ; Levy, Shapiro et al. 1980) . Nevertheless, the major \nproblem was to perform a quantitative analysis of the EEG. The first EEG evaluations were \nvisual, requiring highly qualified personnel for  the interpretation of the EEG. But, even so, \nthe highest average correlation , regarding conclusion from EEG interpretation, between \nseven experienced EEG readers was 56 percent (Berezowskyj, McEwen et al. 1976) . \nIn the 80s , the advance in electronic technology brought about  a renewed interest in the \nanalysis of intraoperative EEG.  The large amount of the raw EEG could be analyzed due to \na newer computer techniques (microprocessor) enable to  extract the EEG into a condensed, \ndescriptive format called processed EEG (Edmonds and Markku 1985; Stanski 2000) .  \nOne of the earlie st statistic al analysis used for EEG was the period analysis. This \nmethod quantifies the number o f times the EEG line cross es the zero and can  be \nperformed manually (Levy, Shapiro et al. 1980) . Nevertheless, the obvious limitations \nof this analysis led to the use of other more accurate and computerized methods.  \n  \n1.4.1 -Power Spectrum Analysis  \n \nThe Power Spe ctrum analysis consists of  the conversion of continuous EEG waveform \ninto a finite resolution numbers obtained in samples sequentially analyzed. The samples \nrepresent a finite interval time called an epoch (Rampil  1998) . The analysis of the epoch \nis performed by using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), a complex mathematic \ntechnique. The FFT decompose the EEG epoch in sine and cosine waves of different \namplitude  at a certain frequency range. The sum of these sinusoidal waves represents \nthe original waveform. The use of power analysis as the measurement of the amplitude \nis a convention reflecting the origins of Fourrier analysis in radio engineering (Levy, \nShapiro et al. 1980) . The power spectrum analysis is then calculated squaring the 40 \n amplitude of the individual frequency compone nt (Fig .3.2) and represents the rel ative \ncontribution of each frequency.   \n \n \n \nFigure 3-Schematic representation of the process of power spectrum analysis.  \nThe original continuous waveform (A). Digital form of the EEG samples (B). Fourrier analysis into a \nmicroproces sor (C). Histogram of the power spectrum (D). Adapted from (Levy, Shapiro et al. 1980) .      \n \nThe Power spectrum analysis take s into account  frequency and amplitude information \nof the EEG waves but the phase angle  is not analysed. The phase angle( \uf071) represents the  \ntime offset of the sinus wave relative to time zero (Sigl and Chamoun 1994) . The phase \nrelated to the start of the epoch is obtained by Fourrier analysis (Rampil 1998) . \nNevertheless the physiological meaning of the phase angles is u nclear. I n general, the  \nawake brain has mult iple signal pacemakers, working independently with little \nsynchronization. In  the \u201csleep brain\u201d fewer independent signal generators are active  \n(Rampil 1998) . \n \n41 \n 1.4.1.1 Spectral edge frequency   \nThe spectral edge frequency (SEF) is a statistical analysis of the EEG derived from \npower spectrum that represents the frequency below which 95% (SEF95%) of the \npower spectrum is located. Some authors use the SEF80% (Long, Shah et al. 1989) . \n1.4.1.2 Median frequency  \nMedian frequency (MF) is the frequency below which 50% of the total  EEG power  \nspectrum  is located  (Schwender, Daunderer et al. 1998) .  \n1.4.1.3 Relative power  \nRelative power of four frequency bands represents  the percentage distribution of total \npower  of each frequency band (Otto, Voight et al. 1996) . The power band ratios, \nrelative fractional \uf071 power, relative fractional \u03b1 power, and relative fractional \u03b2 power  \nare all related to the \uf064 power  (Long, Shah et al. 1989) .  \n \nAll of this measurements derived from the power spectrum analysis are designed by \nquantitative electroencephalogram variables (QEEG) (Otto 2008) .  \nThe performance of EEG derived indexes when used by monitors of depth of anesthesia  \nare sometimes comp romised due to the different pharmacological and physiological \ncharacteristics of the anesthetic drugs, and its effects on the EEG patterns (Rampil \n1998) . Studies performed in dogs by Itamoto and colleagues demonstrated that when \nadministering 20\u00b5g of medetomidine alone, or combined with midazolam, or with  \nmidazolam and butorfanol, the EEG index values obtained are similar which means that \nQEEG should be carefully interpreted to assess the depth of anesthesia when using  \nbalanced anesthesia (Itamoto, Taura et al. 2002) . Nevertheless these QEEG variables \ndetect ed changes in the EEG caused by the anesthetic drugs, but the incapab ility of \nfinding EEG calibration behavioral endpoints  is the major issue behind the QEEG poor \nperformance.  \n  42 \n 1.4.2 -Bispectral analysis  \nThe Bispectral analysis is a processing technique that quantifies nonlinear and linear \nchanges in the generation of EEG.  \nThe Bispectral analysis quantifies the relation between two primary frequencies, f1 and \nf2, and the modulation of the components of these frequencies f1+f2, detecting phase \u2013\ncoupling within the signal, and the variation as a response to the external stimulu s. In \nthe absence of phase coupling the  bispectrum tends to zero; in the presence of phase \ncoupling the bispectrum tends to non zero (Sigl and Chamoun 1994) . The bispectrum is \nnot j ust a reflex of phase coupling, as it is  influenced by the amplitude of the EEG \nsignal and by the degree of phase coupling. Bicoherence is used to incorporate th ese \ntwo variables. A high bicoherence value at (f1, f2) indicates that there is a phase \ncouplin g within the triplet of frequencies f1, f2, and f1 + f2.  Strong phase coupling \nmeans  that the sinusoidal components at f1 and f2 may have probably the same \ngenerator of the neuronal activity (Rampil 1998)  .   \n1.4.3 -Burst Suppression Quanti fication   \nIn deep planes of anesthesia  the EEG may develop a n atypical  pattern of activity . This \npattern  is called burst suppression , which is quantified by the burst suppression ratio (BSr ) \nThe BSR  is characterized by alternating periods of normal t o high voltage activity with  low \nvoltage or isoelectric EEG wave . The isoelectric EEG periods should be longer than 0.50 \nsec., and the waves\u2019 voltages should not exceed  \u00b15.0 mV  to be assumed as BS pattern. The \ntime in a suppresse d state is measured, and the BSr  is the fraction of the epoch length where \nthe EEG is suppres sed. \n \nThe monitors to evaluate the depth of anesthesia incorporate more than one method of \nEEG analysis in an attempt to override the limitations of each EEG parameter itself.  \n  43 \n 1.5-How can the EEG signal be correctly collected?  \nAlthough t he EEG is a  microvolt -range signal , most  of the artifact s influencing the EEG \nwill present  a millivolt magnitude. This makes the quality and consistency of the \nelectrode to skin connection essential to the reliable interpretation of the signal.  \nThe quantification of  impedance is important to evaluate the quality of the electrical \ncontact between the EEG electrode and the skin. In a simplistic definition , the \nimpedance means the \u201cresistance\u201d or not to the electric current flow.  Low impedance \noccurs when you have low re sistance s to the electrical current , which means a good \ncontact between  the skin and  the electrode, allowing an increase in the quality of the  \nEEG  signal. High impedance values could interfere with the reliability of the \nmonitoring results  (Seitsonen, Yli -Hankala et al. 2000; Thogersen and Ording 2000; \nAnderson, Sartipy et al. 2007) . \nThe impedances values during EEG monitoring should stay below 10 k\u2126  (Seitsonen, \nYli-Hankala et al. 2000) . For the example, the BIS monitor needs impedance values \nlower than 7,5 k\u2126 to startup  (Greene, Benson et al. 2002) . On the other hand , the \nCerebral State Monitor needs impedance values lower than 5 k\u2126  to startup .  \nThe skin electrodes used for neurological diagnosis usually have a multipolar assemble , \nbut this complex method is impracticable for monitoring brain activity during  routine \nanesthe tic procedures.  The bipolar assemble is the  best way to collect EEG during \nanesthesia. Fortunately, i n humans the anesthe tic agents induce significant changes in  \nthe frontal cor tex activity which allow  the use of the forehead to stick the EEG skin \nelectrodes to quantify  the anesthetic effects on  the brain electric activity (Bennett, Voss \net al. 2009) . In bipolar assembles , derivations are formed by two electrodes that are \nacknowledged to  be located over active cerebral tissue. It is recommended that the \nelectrodes   form chains oriented longitudinally and/or transversely over the calvaria  \n(Holliday and Colette 1999) . \nThere are different electrodes assembles described in dogs : frontal -occipital  \n(Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007; Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009)  (Fig. 4), bifrontal \n(Carrasco -Jimenez, Martin Cancho et al. 2004)  (Fig. 5), and frontal -temporal \n(Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007)  (Fig. 6). Bergamasco and colleagues described \nthe anterior areas of the brain with predominance and preva lence of slowing frequency \nbands in propofol anesthetized dogs  (Bergamasco, Accatino et al. 2003) . \n 44 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4-Represents the frontal -occipital position  of electrodes .  \nAll the electrodes are in the midline. Electrode 1 is placed 1 cm dorsal to an imaginary line \nconnecting the medial canthi of the eyes, and electrode 3 was placed on the occipital crest. \nBecause of the design of the sensor, electrodes 2 (ground), and 4 (reference) were placed at 2 -cm \ndistance f rom each other (Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007) .  \nFigure 6-Represents the frontal -temporal position of electrodes.  \nThe electrode 1  was placed in the midline on the rostral third portion of an imaginary line \nconnecting the zygomatic process of the frontal bone, and the caudal portion of the frontal crest . \nElectrodes 2 (ground) and 4 (reference) were each placed at an angle of 15o to 30o to the \ntransverse plane. As a result of this placement, electrode 2 remained dorsal to the eyelid, whereas \nelectrode 4 was placed caudodorsal to the lateral canthus of the left eye. Electrode 3 was placed \non the zygomatic process, cranial to the base of  the left ear (Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. \n2007).  Figure 5-Represents the bifrontal position of electrodes  \nElectrodes 1 and 3 were placed 1 cm caudal to the lateral canthus of each eye. Electrode 4 \n(reference) was placed on the midline, and electrode 2 (ground) was placed between electrodes 1 \nand 4 (Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007) . 45 \n 1.5.1 -Types of electrodes:  \nThe most used brain monitor is  the BIS monitor , and most of the studies performed in \ndogs us es the BIS Quatro Sensor  (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, Mass) . In order to \nuse this sensor in dogs, it is necessary to shave the dogs\u2019 head,  which is a strong \nlimitation for veterinary practice . Green and colle agues compare the performance \nbetween patch electrode (BIS  sensor,  Aspect medical systems Inc) and subdermal \nelectrodes using a modified cable of ECG using three 29 gauge platinum needles.  They \nconcluded that both types of electrodes had similar skin impedance, and the results \nobtained are not statistically significant.  The EEG clamp electrodes are also used \nbecause they are easy to apply during routine clinical us e, and because they  reduce the \ncost of EEG monitor ing (Seitsonen, Yli -Hankala et al. 2000; Akavipat, Dumrongbul et \nal. 2006) . Hemmerling and Harvey refer that the use of ECG  c electrodes could replace \nthe patch electrodes of the BIS monitor after a good preparation of the head in humans \n(Hemmerling and Harvey 2002) . The same results were observed for the CSI monitor \nwhere the electrocardiogram  (ECG ) electrodes maintained the same accuracy \n(Anderson, Sartipy et al. 2007) . In conclusion, to record the EEG it can be used small \nneedle electrodes placed in the subcutaneous tissues over the calvaria,  small metal disk \nelectrodes applied to the skin surface , or small alligator clamps attached to the skin after \ndulling the teeth of the clamp , whenever impedance values are respected . \n  46 \n 1.6-How to validate the monitor?  \n \nThe ideal monitor to assess the dept h of anesthesia should correlate brain electric \nactivity and anesthetic drug concentration under general anesthesia, reflecting the \nclinical state of the patient, regardless of the anesthetic drug used. Two concepts must \nbe taken in account when looking fo r a good monitor for depth of anesthesia: validity \nand reliability.  \nValidity is a measurement of accuracy and is difficult to quantify since there is no gold \nstandard for anesthetic depth. Validity represents the agreement between the monitor \nand another r eference instrument (Bruhn, Myles et al. 2006) . \nReliability is a measurement of uniformity values obtained  between repeated   \nmeasures. Reliability can be evaluated by testing and retesting the reliability, in this \ncase concurrent or repetitive measurements of depth of anesthesia will be comparable at \na stable anesthetic state with clinical variables for the example  (Bruhn, Myles et al. \n2006) . \n \n1.6.1 -Characteristics and qualities of the ideal monitor to measure the depth \nof anesthesia.  \n \n1.6.1.1 - Analysis of the EEG as tool to assess the anesthetic de pth. \nTo use monitors to evaluate the depth of anesthesia we must assume that the EEG \nrepresents a cluster of pos -synaptic potentials that can be accurately and reliably \ncorrelated with different anesthetic states (Stanski 2000) . It is still unclear which is the \noptimal EEG processing technique for brai n monitor, and that is why it exists depth of \nanesthesia monitors based on spontaneous potentials, evoked potentials or in multiple \nmodalities. The monitors that combine spontaneous EEG indices with evoked potentials \nshow the best potential, and are curren tly under development (Schneider, Hollweck et \nal. 2005) . An important consideration in the evaluation of clinical monitors is the \ndistinction  between the desired sign al, and the  artifact s on the EEG and on EMG  \n(Edmonds and Markku 1985) . 47 \n 1.6.1.2 - Correlation between processed EEG and cerebral drug effect.  \nCerebral drug effect represents the amount of drug on the effect site  (brain) . Anesthetic \ndose-response curves are essential to validate and characterize the utility of the brain \nmonitor. It is expected that gradually increasing anesthetic concentrations will be \nreflected directly on the EEG index (fig. 7). \nIn 1977, Stullken and col leagues described that, in dogs , the cerebral oxygen \nconsumption dose response curves at MAC of halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane less \nthan 1 are nonlinear. This fact was attributed to a rapidly decrease of cerebral oxygen \nconsumption when the dogs pass  from the awake to anesthetized state (Stullken, Milde \net al. 1977) . Thus, although it is easy to think that the EEG dose -response curve should \nbe exclusively linear for anesthetic agents (Palanca, Mashour et al. 2009) , the dose \nresponse curve that better described the anesthetic index with the anesthetic \nconcentration is typically sigmoidal. Beyond the los s of responsiveness there is a \nplateau in the dose response across a wide range of clinically relevant anesthetic \nconcentrations (Walling and Hi cks 2006; Palanca, Mashour et al. 2009) . This has some \nimplications in the use of brain monitors to titrate the anesthetic drugs because if the \nloss of responsiveness occurs near  the plateau, it will be difficult for the monitor to \ncorrelate with anesthetic depth (fig. 7 ). In veterinary patients, the main reference used to \nevaluate the brain monitors is the correlation of the EEG derived indexes with MAC,  \nand multiples of MAC valu es  (Greene, Benson et al. 2002; Carrasco -Jimenez, Martin \nCanc ho et al. 2004; Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007) . \n  48 \n  \nFigure 7-Represents the different dose -response curves for anesthetic concentration and EEG index  \n(Palanca, Mashour et al. 2009) . \na) Linear dose response.  \nb) Represents the individual variability in linear dose response curves  \nc) Dose -response curves typically sigmoidal  \nd) Represents the individual variability in  sigmoidal dose response curves.  \nThe linear dose response is ideal to obtain the correlation between anesthetics concentrations and clinical \nendpoints.  The dose response curve that better described the anesthetic index with the anesthetic \nconcentration of the drugs is typically sigmoidal  \nThe most informative range of the EEG monitor lies in region 2, where small changes in anesthetic dose \nlead to large changes in EEG index. Region 3 represents a range in which the EEG monitor provides little \ninformation acr oss a wide range in anesthetic concentration. The targeting of this range can lead to \nexcessive anesthetic administration.  \nIndividual variability in the EEG indices corresponding to LOR can complicate anesthetic dosing by \nreducing the informative range of  EEG in region 2.  \nLOR,  loss of responsiveness; pEEG, processed EEG; BS, burst suppression.  \nAdapted from Palanca, Mashour et all 2009.   \n  \n1.6.1.3 -Correlation between electroencephalographic indexes and clinical endpoints.  \n \nIt is imperative that depth of anesthesia monitors have the ability to distinguish different \nstates of anesthesia, sedation, and unconsciousness. In humans, sedation scales  \n(Modified Observer\u00b4s Assessment of Alertness and Sedation, MOAAS) have been as \nmarkers of cerebral activity and drug concentration (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . In \nveterinary anesthesia the methods c ommonly used to analyze the performance of the \nmonitors of depth of anesthesia are the ocular reflexes, eyeball position, mandibular \ntonus, movement, and response to a noxi ous stimulus (Greene, Benson et al. 2002; \nCarrasco -Jimenez, Martin Cancho et al. 2004; Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007) . \n49 \n The burst suppression is another reasonable endpoint. This type of cerebral electrical \nactivity is not observed in the  natural sleep, and it is observed in depth levels of \nanesthesia, presumably incompatible with memory formation.  \n \nIn conclusion , monitors to assess depth of anesthesia should show graded responses to \naltering depth of anesthesia at all levels , from light s edation to deep surgical anesthesia. \nThe variety of combinations of anesthetics should not affect the accuracy of the \nmonitor , and the monitor should respond to surgical stimulus when anesthesia is \ninadequate.  The variables in t he monitor display  should be  easily quantified, readily \ninterpreted, and be unaffected by routine operating theatre interference , such  as \nelectrocautery . \n  50 \n 1.7-What monitors  had been studied for monitoring depth of anesthesia?  \nThe monitor to assess the depth of anesthesia can be divided in two categories. The \nquantitative electroencephalographic monitors, who analyze and quantify the variables \nobtained from spontaneous electrical activity from the brain and a second type of \nmoni tor, which analyze the EEG after stimulation, the Auditory Evoked Potentials \n(AEP) monitors. Recently there are under investigation monitors with multiple \nmodalities, these monitors combine the analysis of spontaneous EEG with metrics based \non evoked poten tials (John and Prichep 2005; Horn, Pilge et al. 2009)  \n \n1.7.1 - Quantitative electroencephalographic monitors  \n1.7.1. 1- Bispectral index.  \nThe bispectral index\u00ae (BIS\u00ae) monitor  (Aspect Medical,  Newton,  MA, USA ) was the \nfirst technology appro ved by US Food and drugs administration  (October 1996)  for \ndepth of anesthesia monitoring . \n BIS is a dimensionless number scale ranging from 0 to 100 . These values correspond to \ncomplete electrical silence to awake respectively  (Johansen and Sebel 2000) . The BIS i s \na complex parameter that integrates a various EEG  descriptors into a single variable  \n(John and Prichep 2005) . The first step on the BIS construction starts with the exclusion \nof the art ifacts from high - and low -frequency. The art ifacts detected are removed from \nthe epoch and repaired by interpolation. The epoch art ifact free is used to calculate the \namount of burst suppression, another concept was introduced in the analysis of burst \nsuppression called QUAZI and w as designed to detect the burst suppression in the \nwandering baseline voltage  (Rampil 1998; Johansen and Sebel 20 00).   \nAt the same time the fast fourier transform ation , power spectrum  and the bispectrum of \nthe epoch are calculated. The values obtained are the n computed to Beta ratio and \nSynchfastslow.    \nThe Beta ratio is the subparameter based on the power of two frequency bands and is \ncalculated by:  log(P 30-47Hz)/ (P 11-20Hz). SynchFastSlow is a subparameter derived from \nthe bispectrum analysis ( Fig 8 ).      \nAn important concept in the development of the BIS is the fact that th ese subparameters \nwere adjusted based on prospective collected database of anesthetized volunteers to \nevaluate the clinical sedative endpoints and hypnotic drugs  (Glass, Bloom et al. 1997) .    51 \n The BIS is the most studied depth of anesthesia monitor in veterinary anesthesia, there \nare  studies in different kind of species, cats, dogs, pigs, horses, goats and rabbits  \n(Antognini, Wang et al. 2000; Greene, Benson et al. 200 2; Haga and Dolvik 2002; \nMarch and Muir 2003; Martin -Cancho, Carrasco -Jimenez et al. 2004; Martin -Cancho, \nLima et al. 2006) . All of this studies were performed with inhalant anesthetics and the \neffects of MAC and MAC multiples on BIS were evaluated.  In all of th ese species the \nreference values for surgical anesthesia were  not fo unded.  \n Green and colleges studied the relationship between BIS  multiples of sevoflurane \nMAC  (0.8, 1, 1.5 and 2) with concomitant administration of neuromuscular blocking \nagents in the intention of diminish the effect of EMG on values of  BIS, since is k nown \nthat EMG is the principal source of the art ifacts. It was observed a decrease in BIS \nvalues when the multiples MAC values for sevoflurane increase. Nevertheless this \nreduction  was not significant differen t between all MAC multiples detected by BIS  \n(Greene, Benson et al. 2002) . Another study with different concentration of isoflurane, \nin absence of noxious s timulus showed poor correlation with BIS, which implies that \nBIS could not reflect the changes on dep th of anesthesia (Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et \nal. 2007) . \nIn BIS monitor the presence of burst suppression could lead to a  false  increase of BIS  \nvalues . This is due to the fact that this pattern  is recognized by the monitor as  high \nfrequency related with a more awake brain (March and Muir 2005) . \nThe results obtained  in different studies for sevoflurane and isoflurane at  de ep levels of \nanesthesia reveal that the burst suppression was observed more commonly in dogs \nanestheti zed  with sevoflurane at 2MAC multiple  (Greene, Benson et al. 2002; Greene, \nTranquilli et al. 2003) . This could reflex a slight difference between activation and \nsuppression of the EEG for inhalant anesthetic agents.   BIS correlated with end tidal  \nsevoflurane better than with isoflurane . Clinical use of BIS monitoring in dogs may \nrequire evaluation of specie anesthetic drug combinations (Green, Benson et al. 2 002). \nThe effects of propofol on BIS in dogs are not well studied, there are just one study \nusing three infusion rates of propofol and. forty and  fifty minutes after the beginning of \nthe infusions there a greater decrease in BIS values for infusion 0,8 mgkg-1h-1 when \ncompared with infusions at 0,2 and 0,4mgkg-1h-1 (Lopes, Nunes et al. 2008) . One of the \nlimitations of this study is the administration of the bolus before the start of the \ninfusions which can interfere in the consequent analysis of the BIS at dif ferent infusion \nrates during the first thirty minutes . 52 \n There are a lack of studies in dogs that evaluate the relationship between clinical end -\npoints  and EEG derivate monitors  Carrasco -Jimenez and colleagues evaluate the \nswallowing and palpebral reflexes d uring recovery of the surgery, the BIS increased \nsignificantly at the resumption of th ese reflexes  (Carrasco -Jimenez, Martin Cancho et \nal. 2004) .  \nThe measure of the anesthetic effect on the brain should be independent of the \nanesthetic agent used and accuracy of the method should detect easily the inadequate \nanesthetic plane.  \nClinical veterin ary anesthesia increase s the use of a multi -agent approach with the \nsimultaneous use of various sedatives and analgesics in addition to an inhalation \nanesthetic. Because multiple drugs are often used, it is not always clear what the effect \nof a specific dr ug is on the BIS.   \nThe association of medetomidine with isoflurane was related with decrease in BIS \nvalues when compared with use of isoflurane alone . (Greene, Tranquilli et al. 2003) . \nThe opioids are currently used in association wi th general anesthetics and it is known \nthat they  reduce the dose of volatile anesthetics and propofol used  (Vuyk 1 997).  \nA study performed with standard doses of morphine associated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nto a constant concentration of isoflurane showed that the administration of morphine did \nnot affect significantly the values of BIS  (Henao -Guerrero, McMurphy et al. 2009) .  \nUeyama and colleagues had determined the effects of perzinfotel, fentanyl and the \nassociation fenta nyl-perzinfotel on MAC of isoflurane and consequently in BIS values \nin dogs. It was founded that BIS increased as MAC of isoflurane decreased when dogs \nwere treated with fentanyl, perzinfotel, or both. n  (Ueyama, Lerche et al. 2009) . This \nstudy did not reflect the effect of fentanyl or the perzinfotel on BIS since the values of \nisoflurane concentration were  not constant. Similar conclusions were  observed  in the \nstudy evaluat ing the effect  on MAC isoflurane from the infusion of morphine, lidocaine, \nketamine . Their combination reduced isoflurane MAC in all dogs and consequently  \nBIS increased as M AC of isoflurane decreased in all dogs, independent of the drug \ninfusion administered  (Muir , Wiese et al. 2003) . \n Nociceptive stimulus  could induce EEG changes that may be indicative of arousal \nfrom anesthesia  (Bimar and Bellville 1977) . In a variety of species, increase in the EEG \nmedian frequency following noxious stimulation may be suggestive of cortical \nperception of pain during anesthesia (corticocerebral arousal)  (Murrell, Johnson et al. \n2003; Otto and Mally 2003) . 53 \n Intra -operative BIS monitoring in veterinary medicine could be used to minimize \nconscious arousal. BIS values in the clinical practice may not predict the depth \nanesthesia for every patient  as it must be considered  the interindividua l variability in \ndrug response.  \nThe change in BIS after a noxious stimulus provides a direct measure of an anesthetic or \npre-anesthetic drug\u2019s efficacy in suppressing nociceptive transmission and arousal from \nthe hypnotic state (March and Muir 2005) . Recently the BIS was used to monitor the \ndepth of anesthesia in p uppies using multiples of sevoflurane MAC, it was observed the \ncapacity of BIS, at lower level of anesthesia, to respond to a noxious stimulus, however \nthe BIS cannot distinguish accurately between di fferent MAC  concentrations (Morgaz, \nGranados et al. 2009) . The BIS was also studied in cats were it was observed that BIS \nduring isoflurane anesthesia could detect corticocerebral responsiveness to somatic or \nvisceral noxious stimulus (March and Muir 2003) . Leigh and colleagues studied the \neffects on BIS by different MAC multiples of sevoflurane and isoflurane, it was \nobserved in both studies that the BIS values recorded were consistently low, which \nmeans that the endpoints used for humans could not be appl ied to cats (Lamont, Greene \net al. 2004; Lamont, Greene et al. 2005) . The BIS was also studied in pigs, rabbits and \nhorses with poor results (Haga and Dolvik 2002; Martin -Cancho, Carrasco -Jimenez et \nal. 2004; Martin -Cancho, Lima et al. 2006) . In goats the studies performed showed that \nBIS can be used to monitor the depth of anesthesia, nevertheless more studies should be \nperformed (Antognini, Wang et al. 2000) . \n \nFigure 8-Represents the flow chart for the calculation of BIS ,adapted from (Rampil 1998) . \n54 \n  55 \n 1.7.1.2 - Spectral entropy  \n \nNeuronal systems have a nonlinear behavior like the EEG waveforms and are \nconsidered not a  sum of sine waves but a cha otic pattern (Pritchard and Duke 1992)  \nThe truer understanding of the brain changes that result in a chaotic dynamics should be \nanalyzed by nonlinear models  (Walling and Hicks 2006) . Entropy is a concept that \nanalyzes the \u201camount of order\u201d  in the EEG (Vanluchene, Vereecke et al. 2004) . \nShannon and Weaver were the first to describe entropy in 1949 (Shannon 1948)   and in \n1984 John and Shore applied it to a power spectrum. Entropy describes the irregularity, \ncomplexity and unpredictable characteristi cs of the signal (Viertio -Oja, Maja et al. \n2004) . \nVarious entropy algorithms have been developed in the past two decades  to characterize \nthe signal of  EEG. It could be computed a time domain called the approximate entropy \nor Shannon entropy and in frequency domai n calle d spectral entropy.  \nThe first step of the  algorithms used in Da tex-Ohmeda Entropy TM Module (Date x- \nOhmeda Helsinki,  Finland ) is the caption of the spectrum applying the FFT, thereafter a \ncalled Shannon entropy is applied to get the spectral entropy. The principal advantage of \nthis approach is the independence of absolute scales such as amplitude and frequency of \nthe signal (Vakkuri, Yli -Hankala et al. 2004; Viertio -Oja, Maja et al. 2004) .  \nFor optimal response  to minimized the time delay of the monitor a  time window for \neach particular frequency i s individually chosen, for example, a t a frequency of  \n0.5Hz, a time window of  30 s would be required to obtain 15 full cycles of the 0.5Hz \nvariation. For a frequency of 50Hz, the same number of full  cycles could be obtained \nwith only 0.3 s of data.  This leads to a concept call ed time-frequency balanced spectral \nentropy  (Vakkuri, Yli -Hankala et al. 2004; Viertio -Oja, Maja et al. 2004 ).  \nIn the entropy module, the shortest time window is used for the frequency range \nbetween 32Hz and 47Hz. The longest time window is used only for frequencies below \n2Hz. For frequencies between 2Hz and 32Hz, window lengths between these two \nextremes are used. The very short window of less than 2s for the range of frequencies \nfrom 32Hz to 47 Hz ensures that the entropy value rises readily at arousal. In particular, \nit provides for immediate indication of EMG activation  (Viertio -Oja, Maja et al. 2004) .  \nThe module measured the biosignal  collected from the skin of the forehead and the side \nof the head,  it contains both EEG and EMG of the frontal muscle.  The EMG signal has \na wide noise -like spectrum with frequencies higher than 30 Hz, the EEG signal 56 \n components put on display  frequencies  lower than 30 Hz during an esthesia  (Viertio -\nOja, Maja et al. 2004) . It is importa nt to refer that in humans the facial muscles are less \nsensitive to the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents than the other muscles. \nNeuromuscular blocking inhibit spontaneous EMG activity, they do not totally abolish \nthe ability of facial muscles to r eact to noxious stimuli when used in clinically practical \namounts  (Paloheim o 1990) . \nThe M/Entropy S/5 monitor shows two parameters that are calculated from two \ndifferent frequency ranges, namely State entropy (SE) and Response entropy (R E). SE \nis computed with a frequencie between 0,8Hz and 32 Hz which represents the EEG and \na small amount of EMG, RE is computed with frequencies between 0,8Hz and 47Hz,  \nThese ranges  of frequencies include the EMG -dominant and EEG -dominant part of the \nspectrum.  \nBecause electrical activity exceeding 32Hz originates mainly in the EMG and only for a \nsmall part in the EEG, the EMG activity is calculated  the by difference of the RE and \nSE values. The short calculation delay between 32 and 47Hz is useful in practice \nbecause it immediately reveals the EMG activation of the frontal muscle related to \ninadequate anesthesia, the imminence of regaining consciousness and strong \nnociception. If there is no measurable  activity in the patient's frontal muscle (i.e. \n'adequate' anesthesia), there is no activity over 32Hz in the biosignal, and the RE and \nSE values a re identical  (Vakkuri, Yli -Hankala et al. 2004; Viert io-Oja, Maja et al. \n2004) . The monitor shows the values of BSR,  nevertheless did no t affect the calculation \nof SE and Re.  \nThe a-dimensional values of SE vary between 0 and 91. RE values oscillate from 0 to \n100 .The RE \u2013SE difference is used to measure EMG and some authors consider that a \nRE\u2013SE difference >10 indicates the presence of nocice ption (Takamatsu, Ozaki et al. \n2006) . With an awake subject, EEG is highly irregular, and the amount of entropy is \nhigh. With  increasing depth of anesthesia, EEG turns towards  more regula r patterns, \ndecreasing entropy (Fig 9 and 10 ). \nThere is  just one study in dogs that evaluate the spect ral entropy to measure the \nanesthetic depth and antinociception (Morgaz, Granados et al. 2 010). The main reason \nfor the use of this monitor is the fact that the analysis of the EEG being independent of \nthe frequency or amplitude of the signal. For the authors t his is a potential  advantage for \nits use in veterinary medicine because it may all ow for EEG analysis and an esthetic \ndepth monitoring in all species Morgaz and colleges concluded that the  M/Entropy S/5  57 \n can distinguish between awake and unconscious state because the monitor could predict \nthe movement of the animals at 0,75 sevoflurane MAC. It was found a paradoxical \npattern at 1,75 MAC which leads to the elevation of spectral index when compared to \n1,5 MA C, that makes the monitor unable to detect different planes of the anesthetic \ndepth in sevoflurane anesthetized Beagles (Morgaz, Granados et al. 2010) .  \n  58 \n  \nFigure 9-Represents the flow chart for the calculation of Spectral entropy .   \n \n                                 A                                                               B  \n \nFigure 10-Description of the Entropy algorithm as applied in the Datex -Ohmeda S/5 Entropy Module  \nA) The perfect sine wave includes only one nonzero spectral component, which is normalized to 1 in the \nnormalization step (2). In the Shannon mapping, both values 1 and 0 contribute to a value of 0, thus \ncorresponding to entropy=0.  \n B) Some amount of white no ise is superimposed on top of the sine wave. After normalization, the \nspectrum includes one high component corresponding to the frequency of the sine wave, and 6 smaller \nnonzero components. In the Shannon mapping, both types of components contribute nonzer o values to the \nentropy of the signal, corresponding to a total entropy =0.12 * 6 * 0.08 =0.60.  \nAdapted from (Viertio -Oja, Maja et al. 2004) . \n59 \n 1.7.1.3 -Narcotrend index  \n \nThe Narcotrend an EEG monitor designed to measure the depth  of anesthesia and \ndeveloped at the Medical School , University of Hannover, Germany.  \nThe principle of this monitor is the establishment of a database of EEG patterns which \nare classified based on the principles  first described by Loomis and colleges in 1937, \nwhere during the sleep there are systematic changes classified in five stages fro m A to E \n(Loomis, Harvey et al. 1937) . More recently Shultz and colleges create a substages A, B \n0\u20132, C0\u20132, D 0\u20132, E0,1 and F 0,1  (Schultz, Schultz et al. 2000)  in an attempt to characterized \nand classified  electroencephalographic patterns observed during an esthesia. There to \nsimplify the interpretation a Narcotrend index was developed as an indication for the \ndepth of  anesthetic level; from 100 to 90=awake, from 89 to 80=sedation,  from 79 to \n65=lightly anestheti zed, from 64 to 37=general  anesthesia, from 36 to  13=deeply \nhypnoti zed and from 12 to  1=increased burst suppression until EEG silence  (Kreuer and \nWilhelm 2006) . \nIn the development of Narcotrend monitor a database, was incorporated with the typical \nexamples of EEG from the stages and substages obtained durin g anesthesia with \nthiopental \u2013enflurane or propofol . More than 1 000 artifact -free epochs with a length of \n20s were visually classified to form the basis for the development of automatic \nclassification algorithms  (Kreuer and Wilhelm 2006) . \nFor the classificatio n a Fourier transformation is applied and a numerous quantitative \nfeatures from the time and the  frequency domain were extracted, power spectrum of the \nfour frequency power bands (  \u03b4; 0.5 \u20133.5 Hz, \u03b8; 3.5 \u20137.5 Hz, \u03b1; 7.5 \u201312.5 Hz and \u03b2; 12.5 \u2013\n45 Hz) , MF (50% quantile), the SEF (95% quantile)  total absolute power (amplitude), \nentropy measures  and autoregressive parameters.  (Kreuer, Biedler e t al. 2003) . The \nextracted parameters were statistically analyzed to identify a subset of \nelectroencephalographic parameters to discriminate more  precisily the differen t \nvisually determined electroencephalographic sub  stages.  This \u201cmemory\u201d created in the \nmonitor could be called the background of the monitor. When a new patient is \nmonitored extensive algorithms for artifact detection are applied , thereafter, the \nelectroen cephalographic parameters that are relevant  for suppression detection and that \ncontribute to the discriminant functions  are calculat ed, and the epoch is classified into \none of the sub  stages.  A sufficient similarity of the epoch to one of the typical 60 \n elect roencephalographic  stages is required for a classification to be made  (Fig 11) \n(Kreuer, Biedler et al. 2003; Kreuer and Wilhelm 2006)  . \nA study o n beagles, the narcotend was used  to detect burst suppression induced with \nhigh doses of hypnotics (pentobarbital or etomidate) and/or seizure s deve lopment \ncaused by compounds,  known by induced seizures in animal  (der Linde, Van Deuren et \nal. 2010) . Van der Linde and colleges concluded that it is possible to reliably calculate \nthe burst suppres sion ratio, spiking and  seizure activity induced by drugs based on a one \nlead EEG signal using the  Narcotrend module.  It is important to refer that during \nanesthesia with fentanyl/etomidate protocol t he Narcotr end index calculated in six  dogs \nwas between 6 4 and 38 units (general a nesthesia) and stable over 3h. All of this dogs \nwere under the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents (der Linde, Van Deuren et al. \n2010) . \n \n \n \nFigure 11-Represents the flow chart for the calculation of Narcotrend stage or index , adapted from \nNarcotrend monitor (Kreuer and Wilhelm 2006) .  \n \n61 \n 1.7.1.4 -Cerebral State Index  \n \nThe CSI is based on the analysis of the frequency content of the EEG signal. These are \nused to define two energy ratios called alpha ( \u03b1) and beta ( \u03b2). Both \u03b1 and \u03b2 show a shift \nin the energy content from the higher to the lower frequencies with deeper anesthesia. \nThe relationship between these shifts is a lso analy zed by CSM as a separate parameter \n(\u03b2-\u03b1). The monitor, who works on -line, also evaluates the amount of instantaneous burst \nsuppression (BS) in each thirty -second period that quantifies the amount of \u201csilent\u201d or \n\u201cflat line  \u201dEEG. These EEG periods c haracteri ze the deepest levels of hypnosis. The \nfour parameters are then used as inputs to a fuzzy logic classifier system that calculates \nthe CSI. Fuzzy reasoning permits the implementation of very complex processes and \ncan also be successfully applied to  high non -linear processes, where it can simplify \nmodeling considerably (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . The four parameters mentioned \nabove are used as inputs for this fuzzy Adaptative Neuro Fuzzy Inference System \n(ANFIS), which governs the rules that govern relations between the input parameters \nusing a least mean squares approach.  \nThis approach  (ANFIS) establishes the relationship between variables based on a no \nrestricted mathematical structure ; the data is analy zed with no prior assumption of the \nmathematical relationship between variables. The advantage of using ANFIS is that it is \na data -driven approach that doe s not assume an underlying mathematical model \ngoverning the relationship between the anesthetic drugs and the response \u2013effect  \n(Gambus, Jensen et al. 2010) . There are just one study with CSM monitor made  by \nBollen and Saxtorph, during se dative procedures using medetomidine , it observed an \nincrease in the CSI values with concurrent decrease in BSR as a response to a noxious \nstimulation (Bollen and Saxtorph 2006) . \n 62 \n 1.7.2 -Evok ed Potential monitors.  \nThese type of monitors have different approach es to assess electrical brain activity . The \nanalysi s is based on evoked responses, series of oscillations in the brain electrical \nactivity, derived from the EEG response to a different st imulus : auditory, \nsomatosensory, nociceptive and visual  (Thornton and Sharpe 1998) .  \n \n1.7.2.1 -Auditory evoked potential monitors.  \n \nThe auditory evoked potential (AEP ) consists of characteristic peaks and troughs,  that \nrepresents the auditory pathway  from coc hlea to cerebral cortex  (Fig.1.12)  (Thornton \nand Sharpe 1998) . This series of waves are caracterized by their latency, amplitude and \npolarity. In AEP studies the peaks are labelled according t o polarity (P=positive and \nN=negative) followed by a number or let ter. The latency of each peak in the  evoked \npotential ( EP) waveshape reflects the time required for the neuronal encoded \ninformation about the stimulus to be transmitted to successive structures in the sensory \npathway  (John and Prichep 2005) .  \nThe waves produced by auditory stimulus have three different origins. Brainstem waves \nare represented by Roman numeral (I -V) but the analysis is not useful  during humans \nanesthesia because with IV agents the waves are not afe cted (Thornton, Konieczko et al. \n1989) , nevertheless it is extensively studied in rats (Shaw 1988) , but unfortunatly it was \nnot found any reports  in dog s during anesthesia.  \nThe early cortical or midle latency waves were investigated during anesthesia.It was \nobserved alterations in the shape of the waves when differents concentrations of the \ngreat majoraty of hipnotic agents were used (Thornton and Sharpe 1998) . For this \nreason  midlatency components of the AEP (MLAEP ), in the range of 20 \u2013100 ms after \nthe auditory stim ulus have received special attention as a possible monitor for depth of \nanesthesia . With general anesthesia, MLAEP peak latencies increase and p eak \namplitudes decrease  (Horn, Pilge et al. 2009) . This waves are  generated in the \ngeniculate and primary auditory cortex and called No,Po,Na,Pa and Nb (fig . 1.12). \nLate cortical waves are not evaluated because they are completely abolish with sedative \nagents (Thornton and Sharpe 1998) . 63 \n AEP is the response of the brain to click stimuli through the hearing nerve AEP is a \nvery weak electrical signal wrapped in the EEG bac kground activity. The repetition of \nsound inputs and the use of computer averaging and filtering techniques allow the AEP \nto be distinguished from EEG background noise. The signal is time -locked to the \nstimulus and most of the noise  occurs randomly, allowing the noise to be averaged out \nwith averaging of repeated response  (Thornton and Sharpe 1998) . One of the most \nimportant features of depth of anesthesia monitors is the time needed to extract the A EP \nduring surgery. In attempt to use MAEP during anesthesia different mathematical \napproaches were used to reduce the complexity of AEP and permit the creation of AEP \nindexes (Doi, Gajraj et al. 1997; Mantzaridis and Kenny 1997; Thornton and Sharpe \n1998) . The AEP indexes ha ve been proposed a s single numerical variable based on the \nmorphol ogy of the curves and is calculated from the difference of the amplitude of \nsuccessive segments of the curve. This numerical variable is determined by a moving \ntime average of 3 seconds intervals  (Doi, Gajraj et al. 1997) . \nRecent  advances in computation had permit the development of an objective method for \nanalysis of the MLAEP resulted in autoregressive model with an exogenous input (ARX \nmodel). ARX model is used to analy ze these amplitudes and latencies to derive a \ndimensionless number bet ween 0 and 100 known as the A -line ARX -Index  (AAI Index \n\u2013 monitor, Fig.  13) (Jensen, Lindholm et al. 1996; Vereecke, Vasq uez et al. 2005) .  \nThe MLA EP has been studied in dogs  with conflicting results. Murrell and colleagues \nevaluate MLAEP in awake dogs and after two concentra tion of sevoflurane, it was \nobserved that sevoflurane cause alterations in the waveforms with an increase of the \nlatency in the peaks P0, Na and Pa, however there was no differences between low and \nhigh concentration of sevoflurane (Murrell, de Groot et al. 2005) .  \nInteresting studies performed by Van Oostrom and collegues w here they use the \nMLAEP and somatosensory evoked potentials to distinguish the sedatives effects  from \nanalgesic effects of dexmededtomidine at different constant rate infusions, concluding \nthat sedative effects was obtained at lower doses than analgesia  effect  (van Oo strom, \nDoornenbal et al. 2011) . \nThe MLAEP index was applied in a closed loop anesthetic system in dogs to control the \ndelivery of propofol. During this study it showed a 89.2% accuracy rate for classifying \nanesthesia depth  (Huang, Lu et al. 1999) . \n \n C\u00f3digo  de campo  alterado64 \n  \n \nFigure 12-The schematic representation of an auditory evoked response.  \n The diagram describes the nomenclature of response and shows its anatomical relationship with auditory \nneuroaxi (Adapted  (Thornton and Sharpe 1998)  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 13-Represents the flow chart for the calculation AAI index.  \nAdapted from Clinical Department Alaris Medical Systems International 2002   \n \n65 \n 1.7.3 - Comparison between monitors  \n \nThe most studied monitor in veterinary anesthesia is the BIS, followed with by the less \nresearched MLAEP. The cerebral state index was the less studied, however the \nalgorithm of analysis used by this monitor can give us promising results. Nevertheless, \nuntil now all studied monitors have significant limitations when intermediate planes  of \nanesthesia are  evaluated.  \nThe monitor of depth of anesthesia  should show graded responses to changing depth of \nanesthesia at all levels from light sedation to  deep surgical anesthesia. However, so far \nthis was not observed in dogs. The indicat or should be easily quantif ied, readily  \ninterpreted, and  unaffected by routine  operating  procedures.  The monitor specificity  \nshould be independent  of an esthetic technique and should respond to  surgical stimulus \nwhen an esthesia is inadeq uate.  \nIt is difficult t o compare the performan ce of depth of anesthesia  monitors  and their \ncorrelations with anesthetic drugs and  anesthetic planes . This is due to  variability  \nbetween patient and study conditions  with are not standar d.  \n  66 \n  \nThe progress of technology and new short -acting anesthetic  agents has allowed the \ndevelopment of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). This technique is generally used in \nhuman medicine as a result of improved for the intravenous pharmacokinetic studies.  \nThere are many advantages of TIVA over volatile anesthetic agents of, in particular, \nhemodinamica stability, and reduction  of pollution in the operat ing room, soft recovery \nand grea t variety of protocols for the administration of drugs that can be used with \nTIVA. There are several manual regimes that have been des cribed for the dogs. \nHowever, the intermittent administration of the bolus of a drug can lead \u00e0 side effects \nthat alternate periods of deep anesthesia  with surface anesthesia with possibility of wake \nup the patient. The administration by continuous infusio ns allow, achieving more stabl e \nconcentrations in the plasma reducing  the total dose of the drug.  \n \n1.8-Target controlled infusions  \nProgress in computing technology gave rise to the development of target controlled \ninfusions (TCI) devices. In anesthesia , TCI uses real time pharmacokinetic models to \ncalculate drugs, bolus doses and infusion rates allowing drugs to be delivery in order to \nachieve an estimated plasma concentration . After the propofol intravenous \nadministration to a central compartment (the b lood), it is rapidly distributed to a second \ncompartment (compose d mainly by the muscular tissues) and slowly distributed to a \nthird compartment that corresponds mainly to the body fat tissue storage. Thus, TCI for \npropofol uses three compartmental pharmac okinetic/pharmacodynamic mathematic \nmodels that takes into account the drug distribution , and estimates the propofol plasma \nand cerebral concentrations according to a given propofol infusion dose  (Marsh, White \net al. 1991; Schnider, Minto et al. 1999) . \nThe development of a three -compartment pharmacokinetic model for propofol for dogs \n(Beths, Glen et al. 2001)  allowed the use of TCI in veterinary anesthesia practice.  \nThis model may be incorporated in a computer software, allowing the selection of a \ndesired target drug concentration set by anesthesiologists. In veterinary anesthesia, TCI \nis just applied to plasma concentration, predicted by the pharmacokinetic model. The \nsoftware calculates the infusion rate at fixed intervals that  is required to achi eve and \nmaintain the pre -selected target concentration.  67 \n The few previous  veterinary  studies about TCI at induction and maintenance of \nanesthesia (Beths, Glen et al. 2001; Musk, Pang et al. 2005; Auckburally, Pawson et al. \n2008; Beier, Aguiar et al. 2009)  using Beths and colleagues\u2019 pharmacokinetic model  \n(Beths, Glen et al. 2001)  reported that  the TCI is an appropriate technique for induction  \nof anesthesia in healthy dogs , and can bett er titrate the delivery rate  to a desire clinical \neffect , while minimi zing side effects  (Musk, Pang et al. 2005) . The TCI allows \nchanging  the de pth of  anesthesia more quickly and effectively (Beths, Glen et al. 2001) , \nand could  be a useful tool to anestheti ze dogs.  \n1.8.1 -Three compar tment pharmacokinetic model . \nIn many  drugs that the ph armacokinetics is better explained by  the use of \nmulticompartment models (Sheiner, Stanski e t al. 1979) . The three -compartment model \nis the most suitable for describing the pharmacokinetics of propofol (Fig.14 )(Tackley, \nLewis et al. 1989; Schnider, Minto et al. 1998)   \n \n \nFigure 14-Representation of three -compartment model of propofol.  \n \n \nThe drug is administered  into a central compartment, from which it is eliminated.  From \nthe central compartment, drug is distributed into a  rapidly equilibrating  second  \nperipheral compartment  (generally compose by splanc hnic and muscle tissue store)   \nand more  slowly into a third compartment  (fat store) . Compartmental models  assume \n68 \n that the drug added to the central compartment is  instantaneously and completely mixed \nwithin the arterial  circulation. The time course that describes the exchange drugs to \nachieve the equilibrium between central compartment and two peripheral compartments \nare obtained by intercompartimental rate constants (K 12,K21, ...). This pharmacokinetics \nmodel must encompass the  elimination of the drug described by K 10 rate constant and/or \nbiotransformation of the drug.  \nIt would be useful to increase the use of kinetic -driven drug delivery  and/or drug \ndisplays  systems , identifying the propofol kinetic  parameter set that best characterizes \npropofol plasmatic concentration ( Cp) across a  variety of d osing conditions . In addition,  \nit would also be useful  to develop  a better understandin g of the predictive accuracy of \ncompartmental models compared with physiologically based models acr oss different \ndosing conditions . \nThe first model described for propofol and applied to veterinary anesthesia was the \nBeth`s pharmacokinetic model for propofo l in dogs (Table 3) (Fig 14).   \n \n \nBeth`s Pharmacokinetic model for the TCI \ninfusion of propofol in dogs incorporated in the \nRugloop II software  \nV1(ml/Kg)  780 \nClTB (54.6)*  \nK10(minute)  0,07 \nK12(minute)  0.0365  \nK21(minute)  0,0312  \nK13(minute)  0,0049  \nK31(minute)  0,0011  \n.   \nTable 3-Beth`s Pharmacokinetic model for propofol.  \n* Clearance is calculated from  V1 and K 10 , but is not required for the TCI.

The core \nof veterinary services grew at a rate of 10% during the last  decade, which is mainly  due \nto medical  advances (Brady and Palmeri 2007) . \nThe anthropomorphization of pets led the pet owners to want the same best -in-class care \nfor their pets , as for themse lves. Forexample, in USA in 2003 , owners spent $1,32 \nbillion in the surgery for Cranial Cruciate Ligament  Rupture. Anesthesia is a  field of \nmedicine that \u201cper se\u201d does not promote the cure of  the patient, but allows the \ndevelo pment of increasingly complex  surgical and medical procedures.   \nA large study performed in UK to evaluate the quality of sedation anesthesia, enrolled \n117 veterinary practices including 98036 dogs and 79178 cats. Results showed a \npercentage of death of 0,17% for dogs, and 0,24% for cat s within 48 hours after the \nprocedure. In healthy dogs and cats the results were 0,05% and 0,11% respectively. On \nthe other hand in sick patients the values were seriously higher: in dogs the risks were \n1,33% and  in cats 1,40% (Brodbelt, Blissitt et al. 2008) . \nIn veterinary anesthesia the standard monitoring measures are  heart rate, noninvasive \nblood pressure and arterial oxygen saturation.  The monitoring of  the depth of anesthesia \nis based only in clinical signs. Nevertheless, the human EEG based depth of anesthesia  \nmonitor, CSM,  seems to have some advantages in its applicability in dogs. Additionally, \nin recent years there was a progressive transition from the use of volatile agents to the \nuse of intravenous hypnotics  in human anesthesia . Total Intravenous anesthesia  (TIVA) \nis nowadays well established in human anesthesia , being a common practice and, in  \nmany cases, the technique of choice . However, the developments of TIVA in humans \nwere not yet followed in Veterinary anesthesia . \nThe lack of studies in dogs that evaluate the relationship between clinical end -points \nand EEG based depth of anesthesia broug ht the need to study the correlation between \ndepth of anesthesia and an objective visual scale that correlates with EEG depression \nand different propofol plasmatic concentrations in dogs under general anesthesia using \npropofol.  \nFor the reasons explained ab ove the overall purposes of this thesis are the improvement \nof the quality of anesthesia, testing the electroencephalogram responses during propofol 70 \n based general an esthesia , and studying clinical responses during propofol based general \nanesthesia  in dogs by: \n1) Analyzing  the  potential advantage of the CSM and its algorithm  \n2) Developing an objective visual clinical scale for correlating with different \ndegrees of EEG depression under TIVA/TCI with propofol  \n3) Correlating CSM parameters with clinical depth of anesthesia  \n4) Correlating CSM with propofol expected effects  \n  71 \n Objetivos de la memoria de tesis doctoral  (espanhol)  \nComo declaro el Presidente de la \u201cAmerican Animal Hospital Association\u201d, estamos \nasistiendo a una evoluci\u00f3n importante de la Profesi\u00f3n Veterina ria, debido \nprincipalmente a los avances m\u00e9dicos, lo que nos ha llevado entre otras causas a un \naumento de mas del 10% en los servicios veterinarios (Brady; Palmeri 2007).  \nLa antropomorfizacion, utilizando el t\u00e9rmino en el sentido de que se atribuyen \ncuali dades humanas a las mascotas, hace que sus due\u00f1os quieran que los cuidados de \nsalud que se presten a sus mascotas sean tan buenos como los que reciban ellos mismos.  \nEn el caso de la anestesia, campo de la medicina que permite el desarrollo de \nprocedimiento s quir\u00fargicos y m\u00e9dicos cada vez m\u00e1s complejos, se demanda que cada \nvez sea m\u00e1s segura y eficiente.  \nEn un estudio multic\u00e9ntrico realizado en el Reino Unido cuya finalidad era evaluar la \ncalidad de la anestesia y sedaci\u00f3n y en el que participaron 117 centro s veterinarios entre \nlos resultados obtenidos (98.036 perros y 79.178 gatos) podemos rese\u00f1ar  \nEl porcentaje de mortalidad en animales anestesiados fue del 0,1 % en perros y \n0,24 % para los gatos, considerando el periodo de tiempo, desde el comienzo de \nla anestesia hasta 48 horas despu\u00e9s de finalizar el procedimiento quir\u00fargico.  \n \nEl porcentaje de mortalidad en perros gatos sanos anestesiados fue de 0,05 y \n0,11 % respectivamente.  \n \nEl porcentaje en pacientes enfermos anestesiados los valores fueron mas altos \n1,33 % en perros y 1,40 % en gatos (Brodbelt, Blissitt 2008)  \n \nEn anestesia veterinaria la monitorizaci\u00f3n  est\u00e1ndar es ritmo cardiaco, presi\u00f3n arterial no \ninvasiva, y la saturaci\u00f3n arterial de ox\u00edgeno, como indicadores b\u00e1sicos.  \nEl control de la profundidad de la anestesia se basa solo en signos cl\u00ednicos.  \nEn anestesia humana, en los \u00faltimos tiempos est\u00e1 increment\u00e1ndose la utilizaci\u00f3n de la \nanestesia total intravenosa (TIVA) sobre la anestesia inhalatoria. Esta tendencia no es \ntan marcada en veterinaria como en  humana, pero cada vez se va imponiendo m\u00e1s.  \nPor eso en el presente trabajo quisimos comprobar si la medici\u00f3n de la profundidad \nanest\u00e9sica se pod\u00eda cuantificar mediante el uso del EEG con ayuda del \u201cCerebral State 72 \n Monitor\u201d (CSM) para obtener un \u00cdndice de E stado cerebral (CSI) que estuviese \nrelacionado con los planos de anestesia.  \nLa falta de estudios de este tema en perros nos llev\u00f3 a realizar el presente estudio con el \nfin de mejorar la calidad de la anestesia, testar las respuestas del electroencefalogram a \ndurante la anestesia general con propofol, y establecer la relaci\u00f3n de las respuestas \ncl\u00ednicas durante la anestesia intravenosa con propofol y el \u00edndice de estado cerebral.  \n 73 \n Chapter 2  \n2-Material and General Methodology  \nAll data analy zed in this thesis was obtained  during routine orchiectomy procedures at \nPorto  Veterinary Hospital. All dogs came from an  adoption program between local \nanimal societies  and the  Porto Veterinary Hospital.  \nA written consent was obtained from the institutions  which have participated in the \nproject . \n \n2.1- Patients and h emodynamic monitoring  \nDogs undergoing scheduled routine orquiectomy were stud ied. All dogs were \nconsidered healthy based on  its clinical history, clinical exa mination and packed cell \nvolume , total protein, blood urea and an ASA score of one. No medications were \nadministered prior to the study.     \nA cannula was inserted in the cephalic vein for drug and fluid administration. A three \nway stopcock was used to connect the intravenous catheter to the propofol and sodium \nchloride 0.9% delivery lines. A Braun infusion pump (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) \nwas used for the administration of sodium chloride at a constant infusion rate of 10 ml \nkg hr-1 during the entire study period.  \nA S/5 Datex monitor (Dat ex-Ohmeda; Helsinki, Finland) was used for monitoring the \nhemodynamic  parameters. The blood pressure was measured non -invasively in the \ncranial metatarsal region of the left hindlimb. Cuff width was choosing to be around \n40% of circumference of the limb. T hree measurements were obtained and used to \ncalculate the medium value made immediately after the preceding one (Datex S/5 \n\u201cSTAT\u201d mode). A lead II electrode ECG was monitored.  \nAnesthesia  was induced with propofol 1% (Fresenius Kabi; Bad Homburg, Germany) \nusing  a syringe pump (Asena GH, Alaris Medical Systems) programmed to allow a \nmaximum  infusion rate of 600 ml h-1. Rugloop II\u00ae software (Demed Engineering, \nTemse, Belgium)  was used to drive the prop ofol syringe pump and store all \nhemodynamic and electroenc ephalographic  data from  the respective monitors, every 5 \nseconds, and also to estimate  the propofol plasma concentrations using B eths\u2019 \npharmacokinetic model (Beths, Glen et al. 2001) . Data was  then extracted from \nRugloop II R using the Labgrab software (Demed Engineering, Temse ,Belgium), and 74 \n exported to an Excel file. The an esthesia setup (devices) used for data col lection is \nshowed in figure 15  \nIn the Rugloop Software the pharmacokinetic model for propofol is not included for \ndogs. It was necessary to open the program and creat e a file were it was inserted the \nBeth\u00b4s pharmacokinetic  model . When we start the study with  a dog it was required to \nintroduce the variables in this file related to the weight of the animal studied.   \n The Rugloop software enables the  control of the syrin ge pum with four modes for \npropofol administration , bolus, con stant rate infusion, and TCI (plasma or effect site \nconcentration)  ( Fig 16).   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nFigure 15-Anesthesia Setup:  \n75 \n The dog anesthesia monitoring (E) is performed by a Datex monitor(A) and CSI monitor(B). Thereafter \nthe RugLoop II(C) software connected to the monitors recorded  all data and facilitates the  control of the \nAsena syringe pump(D ) by the operator . \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 16-Rugloop II Software.  \n  \n76 \n 2.2-Cerebral state index monitoring.   \nThe Cerebral State Index (CSI) is a commercia l index for monitoring the depth of \nanesthesia,  provided by the Cerebra l State Monitor (CSM, figure 17 ) using multi  \nparametric EEG processing  techniques previously explained (Fig 17).  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 17-a) CSI monitor (image from CSI user manual). b) Display ed software in the personal computer.  \n \nThe CSI and frontal EMG activity  data were collecte d every five seconds from a \nCerebral State Monitor (CSM) (Danmeter, DK -5000 Odense C, Denmark) . A modified \nECG cable with clamp electrodes was connected to the CSM cable. The use of ECG \nclamp electrodes facilitates the clinical use and reduces the cost of EEG monitor \n(Seitsonen, Yli -Hankala et al. 2000; Akavipat, Dumrongbul  et al. 2006)  Before the \napplication of clamp electrodes the skin was cleaned with alcohol with 5 minutes before \nthe dat a collection to allow drying (Fig.18).  \n \n77 \n Figure 18-Alligator clamps adapted to collect dog\u2019s cerebral data . \n \nThe Bipolar EEG waveform used was derived from the signal recorded by two different  \nsensor positions of the electrodes using three clamp electrodes . The first position  was \nplaced according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for human CSI monitoring: in the \nmiddle of the forehead/frontal bone (white), to the left side of the forehead near the \nlateral eye socket, and on the te mporal mastoid process on the left side of the head \n(Black). The EEG waveform was derived from the signal recorded between the frontal \n(white) and mastoid (black) electrodes  (Fig 19) . \n \n                               A                                                                 B \n \nFigure 19-Representation of the electrodes placement.  \nA) Dorsal view of canine cranium showing the placement of the EEG recording electrodes.

The sensitivity of EEG was \u00b1400\u00b5V \nand the CSM monitor collected 2000 samples sec-1 (14bits  equivalent), with an every \nsecond update.  To calculate the CSI, frequencies outside the 6 -42 Hz range were filt ered \nout. The CSI is based on the combination of four  subparameteres of the  \nelectroencephalographic signal ( \u03b2 ratio, \u03b1 ratio, \u03b2-\u03b1 ratio a nd BS. The first th ree are \ndepict ed from the spectral analysis and the four th is the burst BSr  calculated by the \nmonitor.  These sub -parameters are used to define two energy ratios called alpha ( \u03b1) and \nbeta ( \u03b2). Both \u03b1 and \u03b2 show a shift in th e energy content from the highest  to the l owest  \nfrequencies with in deeper an esthesia  \nThese subparameteres are calculated by the follow ing approach (Formula 1)  \n \nFormula 1:  The energy of EEG is evalua ted in specific frequency bands used to define two energy ratios \ncalled alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2).  Both  show a shift in the energy content from higher to lower frequencies \nduring anesthesia. The relationship between these quantities is also analysed as a separate parameter (\u03b1-\u03b2) \n(Danmeter 2004) . \n \nBurst suppression is defined as the percentage of time in 30 -s window where the \namplitude of  the electroencephalographic signal was less than 3.5\u00b5 V. These EEG \nperiods characteriz e the deepest levels of hypnosis . \nThese parameters are then used as inputs to a fuzzy logic classifier to calculate cerebral \nstate index (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006)  Scheme 1 .  \n80 \n  \nScheme  CSI subparameters .  \nThese subparameters are then used as inputs to a fuzzy logic inference system that calculates the CSI. \nFuzzy logic is a problem -solving control system methodology that incorporates a simple, rule based \u201cIF X \nAND Y THEN Z\u201d approach to a solving control prob lem rather than attempting to model a system \nmathematically . \n \nThe four parameters mentioned above are used as inputs for this fuzzy Adaptative \nNeuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), which governs the rules that govern relations \nbetween the input parameters using a least mean squares approach.  \nHowever, by combining the parameters, a  higher correlation coefficient can be reached. \nAn intuitive explanation  to this fact is that the  ANFIS system, shown in figure 22 , \nautomatically uses the best parameter, meaning t hat when one fails,  another might still \nbe a good correlate. The burst suppression  parameter indicates deep anesthesia; in this \ncase, the weight on the  spectral parameters will be inferior  because they are not good \ncorrelates  during deep anesthesia with bu rst suppression due to the  nonstationary nature \nof the electroencephalogram in this situation.  The structure of the ANFIS systems \nensures that each linguistic term  is represented by only one fuzzy set.  \n \n \n81 \n  \nFigure 22-Representative scheme of ANFIS structure.  \nLegend: CSI - Cerebral State Index; inputmf - membership function of input; outputmf - membership \nfunction of output (adapted from Jensen et al., 1996)  \n  \n82 \n The CSI is a unit -less scale from 0 to 100  (Table.4) , where 0 indicates a flat EEG and \n100 indicates EEG activity corresponding to the awake state. The adequate an esthesia is \ndesigned to range 40 and 60. The table present  approximate values based on the mean \nvalues of the patient behavior.  \n \nCSI Clinical sate  \n90-100 Awake  \n80-90 Drowsy  \n60-80 Light anesthesia or sedation  \n40-60 Surgical anesthesia  \n10-40 Deep anesthesia normally with BSr  \n0-10 Close to coma (BSr larger than 75)  \n \nTable 4-CSI description  \n \nSignal quality index (SQI) is collected at a constant rate. The SQI is calculated using the \nquality of the acquired EEG signal and on the signal artefacts during the previous one \nminute period. The electrode -to-skin impedance is included in the SQI calculat ion. The \nartifact rejection algorithm ensure s that the incoming EEG is not contaminated by \nexternal noise (<2\u00b5Vp -p, <0.4\u00b5V RMS, 1 \u2013 250 Hz). When excessive noise is detected, \nthe signal quality index is also diminished, thus reflecting the disturbance. The SQI is \ndisplayed numerically as percentage units (0 -100%, 100% equals to the best signal \nquality). Electrode -to-skin impedances at 1 k \u03a9 result in a SQI of 100. If the impedance \nof the white or black sensors exceeds 1k \u03a9, the SQI will gradually decrease. If the sensor \nimpedance is >5k \u03a9 the CSI, BS an d EMG will be blank (\u201c - -\u201c displayed) . In our study, \nimpedances were kept low (within 1 k \u038f and 3 k \u038f) by using a special wax (Elefix, paste \nfor EEG, Nihon Kohden Corporation, Japan) placed between the electrodes and the \nskin.  \nHigh levels of facial  muscular  or EMG  activity can interfere with the CSI under certain \ncircumstances. The monitor incorporates an EMG filter that removes most of the \npotential interfering EMG activity. The EMG bar shows the energy of the EMG level in \nthe 75 \u201385 Hz frequency band (0 \u2013100 logarithmic).  83 \n The EEG data collection ended before the movement of the patient to the appropriate \npositional and  the beginning of the surgery.  84 \n 2.3. Anesthetic clinical end points based on ocular reflexes.  \nThe assumption proposed in this work was that th e ocular reflexes could describe the \nanesthetic stage of the dog.  The palpebral and corneal  reflexes were tested three times \nwith a humidified swab in ser um to prevent lesions in cornea. T his proce dure was made \nalways in the  right eye. The reflexes were co nsidered negatives if there were no \nresponse to these three stimulations. The palpebral reflex was tested gently at the lateral \ncanthus of the eye, and the corneal reflex was elicited by a smooth pressure on the \ncornea. The patient was also observed for ey eball position.  \nPalpebral reflex (PR) and corneal reflex (CR) were classified as present (+) or absent ( -\n); the position of the eyeball was described as eyeball rotated ventromedially (ERV) if \nthe pupil was looking towards the middle eye corner, or centred  (EC) if the pupil was \ncentred between the superior and inferior eyelid. The tests were performed by the same \nanesthesiologst for all of the dogs  and the observed responses allowed the preposition of \nTable 5  \nAnesthetic planes  Ocular reflexes  \nA PR+/EC/CR+  \nB PR+/ERV/CR+  \nC PR-/ERV/CR+  \nD PR-/EC/CR+  \nE PR-/EC/CR - \n \nTable 5-Dog\u2019s anesthetic clinical end points ( anesthetic  planes).  \nThe ocular reflexes are monitored as: palpebral reflex (PR), eyeball centered  in the eye (EC), corneal \nreflex (CR) and eyeball rotated ventrally (ERV). In the presence of the reflex, it is symbolized as +, in its \nabsence, it is symbolized as \u2212. 85 \n 2.4 Anesthetic Protocol  \nData was collected according to three different protocols.  \n2.4.1 Anesthetic protocol A  \nFifteen mixed -breed dogs, ten of which were female, aged 3.4\u00b12.4 years and weighing \n22.5\u00b110.5kg were analyz ed. \nAll dogs were premedicated with 0.5 mg kg-1 morphine sulphate (Morphine injection \n;Martindale Pharmaceuticals) and with 0.03 mg kg-1 acepromazine IM (Vetoquinol\u00ae; \nUnivete), thirty minutes prior to the b eginning of the induction of an esthesia.  \n Anesthesia was induced using a 6 mg kg-1 bolus dose of propofol 1% (Fresenius Kabi\u00ae, \nBad Homburg, Germany) via a syringe pump (Asena  GH, Alaris Medical Systems) \nprogrammed to allow a maximum infusion rate of 600 ml h-1. A propofol bolus dose of \n6 mg kg-1 was decided upon previous clinical observations where the CSI reached \nminimum values around 50 seconds after propofol administration (Ferreira, Ribeiro et \nal. 2006) . RugLoop II\u00ae software (developed by Tom DeSmet (Demed Engineering, \nTemse, Belgium) and Michel Struys (Ghent University, Gent, Belgium)), running on a \npersonal computer, was used to drive the propofol syringe pump.  \nPropofol infusion was ceased after the bol us administration. At this point the CSI was \nexpected to have attained its minimum value. Then, with a decrease in PropCp a \nresulting increase in the CSI values was expected. In order to avoid a total recovery \nfrom an esthesia, the study methodology limite d the recovery to a CSI value of  70. Once \nthe CSI reached 70, the study ended; the depth of anesthesia  was increased and the \nplanned surgical procedures were carried out.  \nDuring the entire study  dogs were allowed to breathe spontaneously via a facial mask \nadministering 100% of oxygen. If apnea were to occur red, the study would be \ninterrupted, the dogs would be intubated,  mechanically ventilated and subsequently \ndiscarded from the final data analysis. No stimuli is  applied at any time.  \n2.4.1 Anesthetic protoc ol B \nFourteen mixed breed dogs aged 2.6\u00b10.9 years, including 8 females,  weighing \n25.3\u00b15.28 kg  were analysed . Dogs were premedicated with 0.05 mgkg\u22121 acepromazine \nIM (Vetoquinol, Univete, Lure,France) thirty minutes prior to th e beginning of the \ninduction of an esthesia.  Anesthesia  was divided in the study and surgical periods: the \nstudy period had not  no external interference and was  divide d in induction and 86 \n maintenance; the surgical period was characterized by external stimulus  and other drug \nadministratio n. During induction of anesthesia , dogs were allowed  to breathe \nspontaneously via a facial mask where 100% oxygen  was provided.  \n2.4.1. 1 First study   \nIn the f irst phase of the study period, propofol was administered at a constant  infusion \nrate of 200 mlh\u22121 .the dogs w ere placed in sternal recumbence .  \nThe first reflexes were tested when the dogs changed to a lateral recumbence without a \ncervical tonus after the beginning of the propofol infusion.  \nThe palpebral and corneal reflexes were tested every 30 second s with a  swab moistened \nwith  serum. The eyeball position was also observed at each test. The tests were \nperformed by the same operator in all  dogs  \nThe study was stopped if apn ea occurred (no breathe for more than 15 seconds), or \nhypotension (mean arteria l blood pressure below 60 mmHg) occurred, or until loss  of \ncorneal reflex.  At this time point, dogs were intubated, the propofol infusion was \nstopped and the propofol  plasma  concentration was allowed to decrease to 3 \u03bcg ml\u22121 . \nAfter intubation, dogs were  manually ventilated using a closed circuit to maintain an \nend-tidal CO2 of 35 mmHg level measured by the Datex S/5 monitor . \n2.4.1. 1 Second study  \nIn the second phase of the study , propofol was administered by TCI using seven \ndifferent constant steps of prop ofol plasma concentrations: 3 \u03bcgml\u22121, 4 \u03bcg ml\u22121, 5 \u03bcg \nml\u22121, 6\u03bcg ml\u22121, 7 \u03bcg ml\u22121, 9 \u03bcg ml\u22121 and 11 \u03bcg ml\u22121. At each level the propofol plasma  \nconcentration  was maintained unaltered for 5 minutes a nd the dogs\u2019 reflexes evaluated \nby the same  anesthesiologist.  During this phase, the  palpebral and corneal reflexes were \ntested. Each re flex was tested three times and was considered negative if there was no  \nresponse in all  three times. The study would be interrupted if hypotension (mean arterial  \npressure below 60 m mHg ) occurred, or if the corneal reflex was lost. Dogs would be  \ndiscarded  from data analysis in the respective propofol plasma concentration level if \nhypotension occurred.  Hemodynamic variables were monitored during the entire study. \nNo stimuli were  applie d besides testing of the reflexes.  87 \n 2.4 Statistics  \nHeart rate and mean arterial pressure values were collected before the administration of \nthe propofol infusion , those values were  then compared to those observed at maximum \nPropCp using analysis of variance.  \nThe results obtained from testing the reflexes were analyzed and grouped according to \nthe propofol concentrat ions and, consequently, with an esthetic depth.  A letter \nrepre senting a d ifferent plane of an esthesia was given to each group of reflexes. Data \nwas tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro Wilk test . \nThe Spearman Rank correlation analysis was used to compare CSI and PropCp, CSI and \nanesthetic  planes, and anesthetic plan es and PropCp . The Spearman Rank  correlation \nwas used  to compare anestheti c planes with CSI and  EMG.  \nThe analysis of the Electroencephalogram parameters change in the last study, in which  \nthe relationship between the anesthetic planes  and different ste ps of PropCp were \nexplored, based on a n appropriate m easure of performance to identify indicators  for \nanesthetic depth , the prediction probability (PK).  Ideally, anesthetic depth indicator \nvalue s should correlate perfectly with anesthetic depth along a lighte r to a deeper \nanesthesia progression on a continuum  way . The mathematical basis of PK was \ndescribed by Smith et al (Smith, Dutton et al. 1996) . A PK value of 1 means that the \nvalues of the predicting variable , e.g., anesthetic depth indicator correctly predict s \nthe value of the observed anesthetic depth. A PK value of 0.5 means that the values \nof the indicator predict no better than a 50 \u201350 chance.  \nHeart rate, mean arterial pressure and CSM data (CSI, BS, SQI and EMG) were \ncompared to baseline values (twenty minutes after the administration of \nacepromazine, since its difficulty to apply the electrodes without sedation) using \nthe Wilcoxon or paired sample T tests.  \nThe t ime delays for  the CSI calculation  range  from 53 to 55 (Pilge, Zanner et al. 2006 \n). In our analysis, a delay of  50 seconds in CSI data was taken into account when \nanalyzing CSI data. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.13.0 for Windows.  88 \n Cap\u00edtulo 2   \n2-Material y Metodolog\u00eda General  \nLos datos analizados en esta memoria se obtuvieron cuando los perros a los que se \nanestesiaba fueron sometidos a una intervenci\u00f3n quir\u00fargica de orquitectom\u00eda.  \nLos animales proven\u00edan de Sociedades Protectoras que ten\u00edan convenios con el Hospital \nVeterinario de Oporto (Portugal).

Se registr\u00f3 el electrocardiograma en la derivaci\u00f3n II.  \nLa presi\u00f3n arterial se midi\u00f3 de modo no invasivo.  \nSe indujo la anestesia con propofol al  1% (Fresenius Kabi; Bad Homburg, Alemania) \nutilizando una bomba de jeringa (A sena GH, Alaris Medical Systems) programada para \npermitir una velocidad de infusi\u00f3n m\u00e1xima de 600 ml h-1. \n  El Software de Rugloop II \u00ae (Demed Engineering, Temse, B\u00e9lgica) fue \nutilizado para guardar los datos del  propofol y almacenar todos los datos \nhemod in\u00e1micos y electroencefalogr\u00e1ficos de los respectivos monitores, cada 5 segundos 89 \n y tambi\u00e9n para estimar la concentraci\u00f3n plasm\u00e1tica de propofol utilizando el modelo \nfarmacocin\u00e9tico de Beths (Beths, Glen et al. 2001).  \nLos datos  del Rugloop II R  fueron tr atados con el software Labgrab (Demed \nEngineering, Temse, B\u00e9lgica) y exportados a un archivo de Excel . \nEn  el Rugloop Software  no es ta  incluido , cuando se compra,  el modelo \nfarmacocin\u00e9tico del propofol en perros. Fue  necesario modificar  su programa ci\u00f3n  y \ncrear un archivo donde se  insert \u00f3 la farmacocin\u00e9tica de  Beth\u00b4s.  \nAl comenzar el estudio de cada perro introducimos las variables relacionadas con el \npeso del animal estudiado.  \nEl sistema de anestesia utilizado para la recogida de datos se muestra en la figura.15  \nEl software Rugloop permite controlar la jeringa infusora con diferentes formas  de \nadministraci\u00f3n de l propofol : bolus, tasa de infusi\u00f3n constante y TCI (Fig.  16).  \n  90 \n   \n \n \nFigure 15: Anesthesia Setup: The dog anesthesia monitoring (E) is perfo rmed by a Datex monitor(A) and \nCSI monitor(B). Thereafter the RugLoop II(C) software connected to the monitors recorded all data and \npermit to the operator control the Asena syringe pump(D).  \n  \n91 \n  \n \nFig 16 \u2013 Rugloop II Software.  \n \n  \n92 \n 2.2- Monitorizaci\u00f3 n del \u201cCerebral state index\u201d (CSI).  \n \nEl \u00edndice de estado Cerebral (CSI) es un \u00edndice con el que se quiere evaluar la \nprofundidad de la anestesia y que es calculado  por el \u201cCerebral State Monitor\u201d (CSM, \nfigura 17) utilizando t\u00e9cnicas de procesamiento de l EEG.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 17 : a) CSI monitor (image from CSI user manual). b) Display software in the personal computer . \n \nEl CSI y la actividad electromiogr \u00e1fica frontal (EMG) son datos recogidos cada \ncinco segundos por el Cerebral State Monitor (CSM) (Danmeter, DK -5000 Odense C, \nDinamarca).  \nUn cable  modificado de ECG co n pinzas de coco drilo o aligator se conecta ron \nal cable CSM. El uso de esos electrodos de pinza  facilita el uso cl\u00ednico y reduce el coste \ndel monitor EEG (Seitsonen, Yli -Hankala et al 2000; Akavipat, Dumrongbul et al. \n2006).  \nAntes de la aplicaci\u00f3n de los electrodos de pinza la piel se limpia  con alcohol 5 minutos \nantes de la recogida de los datos para permitir su secado  (Fig. 18 ). \n \n93 \n  \nFig .18  Alligator clamps adapted to collect dog\u2019s cerebral data  \n \nLa onda bipolar del EEG en nuestro estudio se deriva de la se\u00f1al grabada por dos \nposiciones diferentes de los electrodos utilizando tres electrodos en p inza.  \nLa primera posici\u00f3n donde se colocada un electrodo se hace de acuerdo con las \ninstrucciones del fabricante para la monitorizaci\u00f3n en humanos de la CSI: en el medio \ndel hueso frontal (blanco), en el lado izquierdo de la frente cerca del borde lateral  del \nojo y en el proceso mastoides temporal del lado izquierdo de la cabeza (negro). La \nforma de onda de EEG se deriva de la se\u00f1al registrada entre el electr odo blanco y el \nnegro (Fig 19A e B ). \n \n                               A                                                                 B \n \nFig 19 A)  Dorsal view of canine cranium showing the placement of the EEG recording electrodes .

La \nsensibilidad de EEG fue \u00b1400\u00b5V y e l monitor CSM recogi\u00f3 2000 muestras por segundo \n(14bits equiva lente), con una actualizaci\u00f3n cada segundo.  \nPara calcular el \u00edndice (CSI) se eliminaron las frecuencias que estaban fuera del rango \nde 6-42 Hz . En el c\u00e1lculo del CSI se utiliza la combinaci\u00f3n d e cuarto subpar\u00e1metros de \nla se\u00f1al electroencefalogr\u00e1fica. La primera de ellas se deriva del an\u00e1lisis espectral y la \ncuarta es el ratio de la supresi\u00f3n (BSR %) calculada por el monitor.  Estos \nsubpar\u00e1metros se utilizan para definir dos ratios de energ\u00eda lla mados alfa (\u03b1) y beta (\u03b2). \n\u03b1 y \u03b2 muestran camb ios de energ\u00eda que se obtienen desde  las frecuencias mayores hasta \nlas menores con una anestesia profunda.  \nEstos subpar\u00e1metros se calculan con las  siguiente s ecuaciones  (F\u00f3rmula 1)  \n \nFormula 1:  The energy of EEG is evaluated in specific frequency bands.  These are used to define two \nenergy ratios called alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2).  Both of these  show a shift in energy content from higher to \nlower frequencies during anesthesia. The relationship between these quantiti es is also analysed as a \nseparate parameter (\u03b1-\u03b2).Adapted from Danmeter manual (Danmeter 2004) . \n \nLa Salva -Supresi\u00f3n (BSR %)se define como el porcentaje de tiempo en una ventana de \n30-s donde la amplitud de la se\u00f1al electroencefalogr\u00e1fica es inferior a 3.5\u00b5V. Estos \nper\u00edodos de EEG son los que caracterizan los niveles m\u00e1s profundos de hipnosis.  \nEstos par\u00e1metros se usan como entradas , para un clasific ador de l\u00f3gica difusa , que \ncalcula  el \u00edndice de estado cerebral (Jensen, Litvan et al 2006) esquema 1  \n \n \n96 \n Scheme 1. These subparameters are then used as inputs to a fuzzy logic inference system that calculates \nthe CSI. Fuzzy logic is a problem -solving control system methodology that incorporates a simple, rule \nbased \u201cIF  X AND Y THEN Z\u201d approach to a solving control problem rather than attempting to model a \nsystem  mathematically.  \n \nLos cuatro par\u00e1metros mencionados arriba, se utilizan como entradas para esta l\u00f3gica \ndifusa Adaptative Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), qu e regula las normas que \nrigen las relaciones entre los par\u00e1metros de entrada (Fig 22) . \n. \n \n \nFigure 22 - Representative scheme of ANFIS structure.  \n \nLegend: CSI - Cerebral State Index; inputmf - member ship function of input; outputmf  - membership \nfunction of output (adapted from Jensen et al., 1996)  \n  \n97 \n El CSI tiene una escala de 0 a 100 (tabla. 2.1), donde 0 indica un EEG plano y 100 \nindica la actividad del EEG correspondiente al estado despierto.  \nLa anestesia adecuada en las cirug\u00edas ordinarias est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ada para que el valor del \n\u00cdndice este comprendido entre 40 y 60.  \nTodos los valores de la tabla son valores aproximados, basados en los valores medios \ndel comportamiento del paciente.  \n \nCSI Estado  \n90-100 Despierto  \n80-90 So\u00f1oliento  \n60-80 Ligera anestesio o sedaci\u00f3n  \n40-60 Anestesia quir\u00fargica  \n10-40 Anestesia profunda normalmente con \nBSr \n0-10 Cerca del coma (BSr mayor que 75)  \n \nTable 4  CSI description  \n \nEl \u00edndice de calidad de se\u00f1al (SQI) se recoge  constante mente . Se calcula utilizando la \ncalidad de la se\u00f1al del EEG adquirida pero teniendo en cuenta los artefactos de la se\u00f1al \ndurante el minuto anterior  y la impedancia del electrodo hasta la piel . El algoritmo de \nrechazo del artefacto asegura que el EEG no est\u00e1 contaminado por ruido externo (< \n2\u00b5Vp -p, < 0.4\u00b5V RMS, 1 - 250 Hz).  \nEl SQI se mide  como unidades porcentuales (0 -100%, siendo el 100% la mejor calidad \nde se\u00f1al).  \nUna i mpedancia del electrodo hasta la piel de 1 k\u03a9 resulta en un SQI de 100.  \nSi la impedancia de los sensores blanco o negro supera 1k\u03a9, el SQI disminuir\u00e1 \ngradualmente.  \nSi la impedancia del sensor es > 5k\u03a9 los valores del \u00edndice y la  Electromiograf\u00eda \ndejaran de valorarse.  \nEn nuestro estudio, las impedancias se mantuvieron bajas (dentro  de 1 k \u038f y k\u038f 3) \nutilizando una cera especial (Elefix, pasta para EEG, Nihon Kohden Corporation, \nJap\u00f3n) entre los electrodos y la piel.  98 \n La actividad electromiogr\u00e1fica (EMG) elevada, de la musculatura facial puede interferir \nen el \u00edndice CSI, pero el monito r incorpora un filtro que elimina la mayor parte de las \ninterferencias.  99 \n 2.3. Evaluaci\u00f3n  de la profundidad anest\u00e9sica  basada en  la utilizaci\u00f3n de  los \nreflejos oculares.  \nUna de las hip\u00f3tesis que hicimos en nuestro trabajo es que los reflejos oculares pod\u00edan  \nrelacionarse con el plano de anestesia.  \nLas pruebas fueron reali zadas por el mismo anestesista en  todos los perros.  \nLos reflejos palpebrales y corn\u00e9ales se probaron tres veces con un hisopo humidificado \nen suero pa ra evitar lesiones en la c\u00f3rnea: E ste pro cedimiento se hizo siempre en el ojo \nderecho. El reflejo palpebral (PR) fue probado suavemente en el borde lat eral del ojo, y \nel reflejo corneal  (CR) fue suscitado por una suave presi\u00f3n sobre la c\u00f3rnea. Los reflejos \npalpebral (PR) y corneal (CR) fueron clas ificados como presente (+) o ausente ( -). \nTambi\u00e9n se observ\u00f3 la posici\u00f3n del globo ocular del paciente:  \nGlobo ocular girado ventromedial (ERV) si la pupila estaba mirando hacia la esquina \ndel ojo,  \nCentrado (CE) si la pupila se centr\u00f3 entre el p\u00e1rpado supe rior e inferior.  \nLas r espuestas observadas  se recogen en la siguiente tabla 5  \n \nPlanos anest\u00e9sicos  Reflejos  oculares  \nA PR+/EC/CR+  \nB PR+/ERV/CR+  \nC PR-/ERV/CR+  \nD PR-/EC/CR+  \nE PR-/EC/CR - \n \nTable 5- Dog\u2019s anesthetic clinical end points ( anesthetic  planes).  \nThe ocular reflexes  are monitored as: palpebral reflex (PR), eyeball centred in the eye (EC), corneal \nreflex (CR)  and eyeball rotated ventrally (ERV). In the presence of the reflex, it is symbolized as +, in its  \nabsence, it is symbolized as \u2212. 100 \n 2.4 Protocolo anest\u00e9sico  \nEmpleamos tres protocolos diferentes.  \n2.4.1 Protocolo Anest\u00e9sico A  \nSe analizaron quince perros sin raza, diez de los cuales fueron hembras, con una edad de \n3.4\u00b12.4 a\u00f1os y un peso 22.5\u00b110.5 kg.  \nTodos los perros fueron medicados previame nte con 0,5 mg Kg.-1 de sulfato de morfina \n(Morphine injection; Martindale Pharmaceuticals) y con 0,03 mg Kg.-1 de acepromazina \nIM (Vetoquinol \u00ae; Univete), treinta minutos antes del comienzo de la inducci\u00f3n de la \nanestesia.  \nLa anestesia fue inducida median te una dosis 6 mg Kg.-1 de propofol 1% (Fresenius \nKabi \u00ae, Bad Homburg, Alemania) .La cantidad de propofol admini strada se eligio  \nbas\u00e1ndonos  en anteriores observaciones cl\u00ednicas (Ferreira, Ribeiro et al 2006).  \nLa administraci\u00f3n de propofol se hizo utilizand o una bomba de jeringa (Asena GH, \nAlaris Medical Systems) programada para permitir una velocidad de infusi\u00f3n m\u00e1xima \nde 600 ml h-1 La infusi\u00f3n de propofol ces\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de la administraci\u00f3n del bolo , \nmomento en el que se deb\u00eda tener  un valor m\u00ednimo del CSI.  Seg\u00fan pasaba el tiempo \ndeb\u00eda producirse una disminuci\u00f3n de PropCp por lo que ten\u00edamos un aumento en los \nvalores del CSI. El estudio se terminaba cuando el \u00edndice alcanzaba un valor de 70.  \nDurante el estudio todos los perros respiraban espont\u00e1neamente a tra v\u00e9s de una m\u00e1scara \nfacial a traves de la qual se  administraba ox\u00edgeno al 100%. Si en alg\u00fan caso se produ c\u00eda \napnea, el estudio se i nterrump\u00eda y se descartaba ese  animal para incluirlo en el estudio.  \nPara poder realizar los procedimientos quir\u00fargicos planif icados se aumentaba la \ncantidad de propofol administrada, ya que los animales estaban pr\u00f3ximos a despertarse, \npero estos valores no se contabilizaban en el estudio.  \n \n2.4.1 Protocolo Anestesico B  \nSe estudiaron catorce perros sin raza, con 2.6\u00b10.9 a\u00f1os de edad, incluyendo 8 hembras, \ncon un peso de 25.3\u00b15.28 kg.  \nLos perros fueron medicados con 0,05 mgkg\u22121 de acepromazina IM (Vetoquinol, \nUnivete, Lure, Francia), treinta minutos antes del comienzo de la inducci\u00f3n de la \nanestesia.  101 \n Durante la inducci\u00f3n de la an estesia, los perros pod\u00edan respirar espont\u00e1neamente a \ntrav\u00e9s de una m\u00e1scara facial y se les suministraba  ox\u00edgeno al 100%.  \n \nLa anestesia se realizo en dos estudios  o protocolos : \n \n2.4.1.1 Primer estudio   \nEn la primera fase del per\u00edodo de estudio, se administ r\u00f3 propofol en una infusi\u00f3n \nconstante de 200 mlh\u22121 . \nLos perros fueron colocados en dec\u00fabito  esternal, y se evaluaron los primeros reflejos \ncuando los perros se cambiaron a una posici\u00f3n de dec\u00fabito lateral, cuando yo no hab\u00eda \ntono cervical  \nLos reflejos pa lpebrales y corn\u00e9ales se observaron cada 30 segundos, anot\u00e1ndose \ntambi\u00e9n la posici\u00f3n del globo ocular. Las observaciones fueron realizad as por el mismo \nanestesista en  todos los perros.  \nEl estudio fue detenido en caso de apnea ( el perro no respira durante m\u00e1s de 15 \nsegundos), o hip otensi\u00f3n (presi\u00f3n arterial menor  de 60 mm .Hg), o hasta la p\u00e9rdida del \nreflejo corneal.  \n \n2.4.1.1Segundo studio  \nEn la segunda fase, se administr\u00f3 propofol en diferentes concentraciones mediante el \nTCI (Target controlled infusions),con concentraciones de propofol en plasma de: 3 \n\u03bcg/ml., 4 \u03bcg /ml, 5 \u03bcg /ml., 6\u03bcg/ ml., 7 \u03bcg /ml., 9 \u03bcg / ml. y 11 \u03bcg / ml. \nEn cada nivel, la concentraci\u00f3n plasm\u00e1tica de propofol se mantuvo inalterada durante 5 \nminutos.  \nLos reflejos de los perros, pal pebrales y corn\u00e9ales, fueron evaluados por el mismo \nanestesi\u00f3logo. Cada reflejo fue probado en tres ocasiones y fue considerado negativo si \nno hubo respuesta las tres veces.  \nEl estudio se interrumpi\u00f3 si se produjo hipotensi\u00f3n (presi\u00f3n arterial menor de 60  mm \nHg), o si el reflejo corneal se pierde. Los datos de los perros con hipotensi\u00f3n fueron \ndescartados.  \nLas variables hemodin\u00e1micas fueron controladas durante todo el estudio.  102 \n 2.4 Estadisticas  \nEl ritmo card\u00edaco y presi\u00f3n arterial se midieron antes del i nicio de la infusi\u00f3n de \npropofol y comparados con los observados en PropCp mediante an\u00e1lisis de la varianza.  \nLos resultados obtenidos de las pruebas de los reflejos fueron analizados y agrupados , \nen funci\u00f3n de  las concentraciones de propofol y, consecuent emente, con profundidad \nanest\u00e9sica. Los datos fueron analizados  mediante la prueba Shapiro Wilk.  \nEl an\u00e1lisis de correlaci\u00f3n de Spearman Rank se utilizo para comparar : CSI con PropCp ; \nCSI con planos anest\u00e9sicos y planos de anest\u00e9sicos con PropCp. La correla ci\u00f3n de \nrango de Spearman fue utilizada tambi\u00e9n para  comparar planos anest\u00e9sicos con CSI \n(\u00cdndice de estado cerebral) y con EMG  (electromiograf\u00eda) . \nEn el \u00faltimo estudio, la relaci\u00f3n entre los plan os de anest\u00e9sicos y diferentes medidas de \nPropCp, se bas\u00f3 en una medida apropiada de rendimiento para identificar indicadores de \nprofundidad anest\u00e9sica, la probabilidad de predicci\u00f3n (PK) (Smith, Dutton et al. 1996)  \nUn valor de PK de 1 significa que los valores de la variable de predicci\u00f3n, por ejemplo, \nel indicador  de profundidad anest\u00e9sica predice correctamente el valor de la profundidad \nanest\u00e9sica observado. Un valor de PK de 0,5 significa que los valores del indicad or solo \npredicen una probabilidad  de 50 \u201350.  \nLa frecuencia card\u00edaca, presi\u00f3n arterial media y los d atos obtenidos con el \u201cCerebral \nState Monitor\u201d  (CSI, BS, SQI y EMG) se compararon con los valores de referencia \n(obtenidos veinte minutos despu\u00e9s de la administraci\u00f3n de acepromazina, que se \nnecesitaba  para poder aplicar los electrodos), mediante las prue bas de t de muestras \npareadas o Wilcoxon.  \nEl an\u00e1lisis estad\u00edstico se realiz\u00f3 mediante SPSS v. 13.0 para Windows.  \n 103 \n Chaper 3   \nResults  \n3.1 Section One  \nBrain monitoring in dogs using the cerebral state index during the induction \nof anesthesia  via target -controlled infusion of propofol.  \n \nRibeiro, L.M.

Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) software, based on the pharmacokinetic \nmodel for propofol, was used to control the syringe pump and to estimate plasma \npropofol concentrations (PropC p) and the CSI values every five seconds. Three \nelectrodes placed in the centre of the forehead, on the left side of the forehead and on \nthe left mastoid were used to collect the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal \nconverted by the Cerebral State Monitor into the CSI.  \nThe cerebral electrical changes induced by increasing propofol concentrations appear to \nbe detected by CSI monitoring in dogs. The negative correlation between CSI and 104 \n PropCp demonstrates that the CSI could be used to assess electrical brain activity in \ndogs during the induction of anesthesia  with propofol.  105 \n 3.1.2 -Introduction  \nAnaesthesiology has improved notably thanks to developments in monitoring \ncardiovascular parameters during general anesthesia . Anaesthesiologists are now able to \nroutine ly control physiological parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate and \nrespiratory rate. However, the direct determination of the effects of anesthetic  and \nsedative agents on the Central Nervous System remains a challenge (Flaishon R 1 997). \nTarget Controlled Infusion (TCI) is an anesthetic  delivery system now widely used in \nhuman anesthesia  (Guarracino, Lapolla et al. 2005) . In veterinary medicine, some \nreports have been published using TCI in dogs during anesthesia  induction and \nmaintenance (Beths, Gl en et al. 2001; Musk, Pang et al. 2005) , which state that TCI is \nan appropriate technique for use in dogs. TCI can improve the delivery rate of a desired \nclinical ef fect while minimising side effects (Musk, P ang et al. 2005)  and allows a more \neffective and easy control of the depth of anesthesia  (Beths, Glen et al. 2001) . \nIn human medicine, a variety of analytical concepts have been proposed to quantify \nchanges in the EEG during general anesthesia . The monitor most widely used for this \npurpose is the bispectral index (BIS), which is largely based on the bispectrum analysis \nof the EEG (Stanski 2000) . On the other hand, the Cerebral State Monitor (CSM) was \nrecently introduced as an intra -operative monitor of anesthetic  depth (Zhong, Guo et al. \n2005) . The Cerebral State Index (CSI) provided by CSM monitors is based on a \ncombination of four sub parameters of the e lectroencephalographic signal. Three of \nthese derive from spectral analysis of the EEG, and the fourth is the burst suppression \n(BS) calculated by the CSM (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . The CSI is a numerical scale \nbetween \u201c0\u201d and \u201c100\u201d, where \u201c0\u201d represents an isoelectric EEG line and \u201c100\u201d \nrepresents the EEG electrical activity of a fully awake individual. CSI is based on the \nanalysis of the EEG frequency using a fuzzy logic classifier, whereas BS is the \npercentage of isoelectrical EEG signal during each 30 -second period (Danmeter 2004) . \nThe ideal anesthetic  level for humans was established to be between 40 an d 60 (Jensen, \nLitvan et al. 2006) .   \nIn veterinary medicine, BIS monitoring has been proposed as a way to assess dept h of \nanesthesia  in dogs (Muir , Wiese et al. 2003) , cats (March and Muir 2003)  and pigs \n(Martin -Cancho, Lima et al. 2006) . However its applicability is not clear when it comes \nto variation between species and drugs. Furthermore the correlation between EEG \ndepression and the BIS index is unclear (March and Muir 2005) . In animals, increased 106 \n concentrations of anesthetic  agents showed a reduction in BIS values, but it was not \npossible to establish a BIS interval where it is safe to maintain anesthesia  (Lamont, \nGreene et al. 2005; March and Muir 2005)  \nThe CSM may be a useful monitor to access depth of anesthesia  in veterinary medicine. \nThis monitor provides a similar brain monitoring function to that of the BIS. The \nCSM\u2019s small size and low cost when compared to other brain monitors makes it an \nappealing instrument for use by veterinary professionals in anesthetic  procedures. The \nCSM monitor has not been studied to the same extent as the BIS. In v eterinary \nanesthesia , the CSM monitor has only been studied in dogs by Bollen and Saxtorph, \nduring sedative procedures using medetomidine (Bollen and Saxtorph 2006) . \nTo our knowledge, no stud ies have been published involving the use of CSI monitoring \non dogs during anesthesia . The CSM algorithm used to estimate CSI is different from \nthat used by the BIS monitor. The CSM uses a fuzzy logic analysis tool which is not \nspecifically adjusted to use  on humans.  On the contrary, the BIS\u2019 calculations use data \nfrom 5000 human anesthetic  procedures stored in a database (Johansen and Sebel 2000) . \nTherefore, it is possible that CSI monitoring could yield better results than BIS when \nmonitoring brain activity in dogs during anesthetic  procedures. The objective of this \nstudy is to analyse the correlation between CSI and propofol -estimated plasma \nconcentrations during induction of anesthesia  in dogs.  107 \n 3.1.3 -Material and Methods  \n3.1.3.1 -Patients and hemodynamic  monitoring  \nAfter Research Committee approval and informed consent, fifteen healthy dogs \nundergoing scheduled routine surgical procedures were enrolled in this study. All dogs \nwere premedicated with 0.5 mg kg-1 morphine sulphate (Morphine injection ;Martindale \nPharmaceuticals) and with 0.03 mg kg-1 acepromazine IM (Vetoquinol\u00ae; Univete), \nthirty minutes prior to the beginning of the induction of anesthesia . \nA peripheral catheter was inserted in the cephalic vein for drug and fluid administration. \nA three -way stopcock was used to connect the intravenous catheter to the propofol and \nto the sodium chloride 0.9% delivery lines. A Braun infusion pump (Braun, Melsungen, \nGermany) was used to administrate sodium chloride 0.9 % at a constant infusion rate of \n10 ml kg-1 hr-1 throughout the study period.  \nA S/5 Datex monitor (Datex -Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) was used to collect the \nhemodynamic  data. The non -invasive blood pressure was measured using an automated \noscillometric method on the posterior left limb using repeated measurements: each \nmeasurement was carried out immediately after the preceding one (Datex S/5 \u201cSTAT\u201d \nmode) which corresponds to a continuo us mode for collecting blood pressure \nmeasurements throughout the study. Heart rate was monitored using three ECG \nelectrodes placed in accordance with Academy of Veterinary Cardiology Committee \nspecifications.  \n3.1.3.2 -Cerebral state index monitoring  \nThe CS I and frontal electromyographic activity (EMG) data were collected from a \nCerebral State Monitor (CSM) (Danmeter, DK -5000 Odense C, Denmark) using three \nclamp electrodes placed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for human CSI \nmonitoring: in the m iddle of the forehead/frontal bone (white), to the left side of the \nforehead near the lateral eye socket, and on the temporal mastoid process on the left side \nof the head (Black). The EEG waveform was derived from the signal recorded between \nthe frontal (w hite) and mastoid (black) electrodes. The frequency content was between \n2-35 Hz and the CSM monitor collects 2000 samples sec-1 (14bits equivalent), updating \nevery second and filtering between 6 and 42 Hz. (Danmeter 2004) . Impedances were \nkept a t a low level (within 1 k \u038f and 3 k \u038f) by placing wax (Elefix, paste for EEG. \nNihon Kohden Corporation)between the electrodes and the skin.  108 \n The CSI is based on analysis of the frequency content of the EEG signal. The EEG \nenergy is characterised into specific  frequency bands. These are used to define two \nenergy ratios, namely alpha ( \u03b1) and beta ( \u03b2). There is a shift exhibited in the energy \ncontent of both \u03b1 and \u03b2, from a relatively high to a relatively low frequency level, when \nthe animal is in a deeper state of anesthesia . The relationship between these shifts is also \nanalysed by CSM as a separate parameter ( \u03b2-\u03b1). The monitor, that works online, also \nevaluates the amount of instantaneous BS during each thirty -second period of the EEG \nin order to quantify the a mount of time the EEG is \u201csilent\u201d or \u201cflat -line\u201d. These EEG \npatterns typify the very deepest levels of hypnosis. The four parameters are inputted \ninto a fuzzy -logic classifier system that calculates the CSI. Fuzzy reasoning enables \nvery complex processes t o be carried out and can also be successfully applied to high \nnon-linear processes, where it can considerably simplify modelling (Jensen, Litvan et al. \n2006) . \nThe signal quality index (SQI) was collected at a constant rate. The SQI is calculated \nbased on the quality of the EEG signal obtained and the signal artefacts recorded during \nthe preceding one -minute period. The electrode -to-skin impedance is included in the \nSQI calculation. The SQI is displayed numerically as percentage units (0 -100%, 100% \nequals optimum signal quality).Electrode -to-skin impedances at 1 k \u03a9 result in a SQI of \n100. If the impedance of the white or black sensors exceeds 1k \u03a9, the SQI will gradually \ndecrease. The artefact rejection algorithm ensures that the incoming EEG is not \ncontaminated by external noise (<2\u00b5Vp -p, <0.4\u00b5V RMS, 1 \u2013 250 Hz). When excessive \nnoise is detected, the signal quality index i s also diminished, thus reflecting the \ndisturbance (Danmeter 2004) .  \nElectromyographic (EMG) activity from head muscles was also recorded by the CSM \nevery 5 seconds.  \n3.1.3.3 -Anesthetic  protocol  \nAnesthesia  was induced using a 6 mg kg-1 bolus dos e of propofol 1% (Fresenius Kabi\u00ae, \nBad Homburg, Germany) via a syringe pump (Asena GH, Alaris Medical Systems) \nprogrammed to allow a maximum infusion rate of 600 ml h-1. A propofol bolus dose of \n6 mg kg-1 was decided upon previous clinical observations whe re the CSI reached \nminimum values around 50 seconds after propofol administration (Ferreira, Ribeiro et \nal. 2006) . RugLoop II\u00ae software (developed by Tom DeSmet (Demed Engi neering, \nTemse, Belgium) and Michel Struys (Ghent University, Gent, Belgium)), running on a 109 \n personal computer, was used to drive the propofol syringe pump. The pharmacokinetic \nmodel for propofol from Beths and colleagues (Beths, Glen et al. 2001)  was \nincorporated in the RugLoop II\u00ae software and was used to estimate the propofol plasma \nconcentrations (PropCp). RugLoop II\u00ae was also used to store all pharmacokinetic, \nhemodynamic  and electroencephalographic data at five -second intervals.  \nPropofol infu sion was ceased after the bolus administration. At this point the CSI was \nexpected to have attained its minimum value. Then, with a decrease in PropCp a \nresulting increase in the CSI values was expected. In order to avoid a total recovery \nfrom the anesthes ia, the study methodology limited the recovery to a CSI value of 70. \nOnce the CSI reached 70, the study ended; the depth of anesthesia  was increased and the \nplanned surgical procedures were carried out.  \nDuring the entire study period dogs were allowed to b reathe spontaneously via a facial \nmask administering 100% oxygen. If apnea were to occur, the study would be \ninterrupted, the dogs intubated and mechanically ventilated and subsequently discarded \nfrom the final data analysis. No stimuli were applied at any  time.  \n3.1.3.4 -Statistical analysis.  \nData was tested for normal distribution and for homogeneity of variance using the \nShapiro Wilk and the Levene tests respectively. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure \nvalues were collected before propofol infusion was begun and compared to those \nobserved at maximum PropCp using analysis of variance. The CSI and PropCp data, \ncollected at five -second intervals after the start of propofol infusion, were compared \nusing Spearman Rank correlation analysis. A delay of 50 secon ds in CSI data was taken \ninto account when analyzing CSI data (Pilge, Zanner et al. 2006 ) . Statistical analysis \nwas performed using SP SS v.13.0 for Windows. Data are expressed in mean\u00b1sd; \nP<0.05  was considered statistically significant.  \n 110 \n 111 \n 3.1.4 -Results  \nFifteen mixed -breed dogs, ten of which were female, aged 3.4\u00b12.4 years and weighing \n22.5\u00b110.5kg were analysed. Prior to the induction of  anesthesia , CSI was 90.7\u00b1 4, heart \nrate was 103.6\u00b120.3 bpm and mean arterial pressure was 83.1\u00b1 14.9 mmHg.  \nDuring the induction of anesthesia ,  the maximum PropCp occurred 46.3\u00b145.9 seconds \nafter propofol infusion was started and was 7.18\u00b10.39 \u00b5g ml-1, which corresponded to a \nCSI value of 67\u00b112, with SQI and EMG values of 78.0\u00b112.4 % and 32.9\u00b130.8 % \nrespectively. At this point, heart rate was 122\u00b133.3 bpm and mean arterial pressure was \n78.4\u00b119.4 mmHg. There was a 13% decrease in mean arterial pressure ( P<0.05) and a \n17% increase in heart rate ( P<0.05 ) between awake values and those values rec orded at \nmaximum PropCp (table 6 ). \nThe minimum CSI values observed were 52.3\u00b19.6 and occurred with a PropCp of \n5.2\u00b10.96 \u00b5g ml-1, 1.8\u00b11.5 minutes after the maximum Prop Cp value was attained; SQI \nand EMG values were 83\u00b112.1% and 30.7\u00b126.5% respectively. At this point in time, \nheart rate was 117.4\u00b131.9 bpm and mean arterial pres sure was 73.3\u00b116.2 mmHg (table \n7). \nAt the end of the study, CSI was 70.3\u00b11.2 with SQI and EMG va lues of 76.8\u00b113.5% \nand 31.5\u00b114% respectively; PropCp was 3.83\u00b11.3\u00b5g ml-1, heart rate was 110.5\u00b128 bpm \nand mean arterial pressure was 74.3\u00b114 mmHg.  \nA significant negative correlation was observed between CSI and PropCp (correlation \ncoefficient of -0.579;  P<0.01) (figure 23 ). 112 \n Table 6-Values obtained at maximum concentration of propofol from each individual dog.  \n Weight(Kg)  HR(bpm)  MAP(mmhg)  PropCp (m\u00e1x)\u00b5g/ml  CSI EMG(%)  \nD1 21 117 55 7.15 67 0 \nD2 12 98 85 7.35 55 48 \nD3 5.7 121 93 7.51 56 80 \nD4 35 123 77 6.74 83 20 \nD5 29 156 51 6.76 44 0 \nD6 6,7 78 64 7.34 63 52 \nD7 21 128 94 6.61 61 77 \nD8 17 65 72 7.19 57 0 \nD9 10 203 65 7.47 78 82 \nD10 28 158 62 7.02 70 6 \nD11 45 103 63 6.58 68 0 \nD12 6.3 129 97 7.52 66 53 \nD13 25 143 66 7.09 93 38 \nD14 25 102 117 7.02 77 28 \nD15 18 109 70 7.78 71 10 \nP=Patient, HR = heart rate, MAP=Mean arterial pressure, PropCP= Predicted Propofol Plasma \nConcentration, maximum, CSI=Cerebral State index, EMG=Electromyography . \n 113 \n Table 7-Values obtained from each individual at minimum CSI value  \n HR(bpm)  MAP(mmhg)  PropCp \u00b5g/ml  CSI EMG  \nD1 109 50 5.96 50 0 \nD2 94 77 5.79 47 57 \nD3 102 84 5.02 45 39 \nD4 112 75 3.54 56 0 \nD5 150 51 5.83 38 0 \nD6 84 56 5.36 54 43 \nD7 128 81 4.20 51 24 \nD8 76 67 4.90 52 0 \nD9 191 61 6.69 70 87 \nD10 158 62 5.85 63 10 \nD11 101 63 6.09 68 0 \nD12 123 97 6.50 49 47 \nD13 110 81 4.76 38 26 \nD14 88 77 4.75 55 27 \nD15 130 104 3.63 55 0 \nP=Patient, MAP=Mean arterial pressure, PropCP= Predicted Propofol Plasma Concentration, \nCSI=Cerebral St ate index, EMG=Electromyography.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure  23-Correlation between CSI and propofol estimated plasma concentrations (PropCp) from the \nbeginning of the study until maximum achieved estimated propofol concentration.  \n114 \n 3.1.5 -Discussion  \nThe present study analysed the correlation between estimated PropCp concentrations \nand their effects on CSI monitoring in dogs at different points during induction of \nanesthesia : at maximum PropCp, at minimum CSI values and  when the CSI value \nreached 70 during the washout phase after the propofol bolus.  \nThere are no universally accepted standard electrode locations for EEG recording in \ndogs considered to be ideal for electrode placing during clinical research or clinical \npractice (Pellegrino  and Sica  2004) . There fore, the location chosen by us to place the \nelectrodes was the same as that referred to by Grenne, Benson and colleagues (Greene, \nBenson et al. 2002)  and described by Pellegrino and Sica as suitable for EEG re cording \n(Pellegrino  and Sica 2004) . \nPrior to induction of anesthesia , CSI values were 90.7\u00b14 in the dogs used in our study. \nIn humans, CSI values between 90 -100 represent the electrical brain activity of an \nawake individual while CSI values between 80 to 90 indicate a low level of sedation \n(Danmeter 2004) . The effects of pre -medication with acepromazine and morphine \n(Pascoe 2000)  may explain the CSI values observed in dogs at the outset of our study.  \nNolan and Reid suggested that tracheal intubation should not be performed when the \naverage propofol blood concentration is below 5.4 \u00b5g ml-1 (Nolan and Reid.J. 1993) . \nBased on previous clinical observations, we decided to administer a 6mg kg-1 propofol \nbolus to induce anesthesia . This dose raised PropCp to a maximum of 7.18 \u00b5g ml-1on \naverage. Thus, the maximum PropCp attained in our study is clinically acceptable for \nanesthesia  induction and tracheal intubation.  \nOur results showed that increasing the concentration of propofol during induction of \nanesthesia  in dogs resulted in a progressive decrease in CSI values. However, a large \ninter-individual variability in CSI responses was also observed (table 1 and table 2). The \ndifferences in time taken to attain the maximum PropCp and CSI response may be \njustified by the large weight variability among the dogs used and by the maximum \ninfusion rate of 600 ml h-1 permitted by the syringe pump during bolus administration. \nThe plasma drug concentrations cannot in themselves predict the time span or \nmagnitude of drug effect  (Holford and Sheiner 1981) . When the plasma drug \nconcentrations are increased, a time lag occurs until an equilibrium between plasma and \neffect site drug concentration is reached (Jacobs 1995) . The time needed to transfer the \ndrug to the effect site (the brain in the case of hypnotics) depends on the concentration 115 \n gradient, and an increased gradient requires less time to induce anesthesia  (Musk, Pang \net al. 2005) .  \nBeths\u2019 pharmacokinetic model (Beths, Glen et al. 2001)  was developed using dogs with \na wide range of ages and weights. In humans, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic \ndifferences are described among children, elderly patients and adults (Kazama, Ikeda et \nal. 1999; Herm\u00e1n  R. Mu\u00f1oz 2004) . A parallel could be inferred for veterinary medicine \nwhere significant pharmacokinetic differences exist for propofol use across different \nbreeds, ages and weights. This could prove limiting when trying to apply the \npharmacokinetic model. Nevertheless, there are studies showing that TCI using this \npharmacokinetic model in dogs allowed for better propofol titration with improved \ncontrol of anesthetic  depth (Beths, Glen et al. 2001)  and fewer unwante d side effects \n(Musk, Pang et al. 2005)  when compared to manual infusion.  \nEMG values higher than 30% were observed in seven dogs at maximum PropCp and in \nfive dogs at minimum CSI values. EMG activity is the most significant source of EEG \nartefact. Variations in EMG activity are associated with r apid changes in BIS values in \ndogs (Greene, Benson et al. 2002) . Despite the fact that the CSI algorithm also \nincorporates an EMG filter that removes most potentially interfering EMG activity, the \nEMG still ha s a significant influence on the CSI value (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . \nHowever, there are no published studies that  quantify the total influence of EMG on \nCSI. Low EMG values are ideal when monitoring brain activity. One way of achieving \nthis would be the administration of myorelaxant drugs. However, as our study was \nperformed during induction of anesthesia  it would be  unethical and unsafe to administer \nmyorelaxant drugs prior to tracheal intubation.  \nAnother important parameter to take into account when using CSI monitoring is the \nSQI, which represents the quality of the EEG signal received. SQI calculation is based \non a series of artefacts that occur during each one -minute period. The SQI is also \ninfluenced by the level of impedance of the electrodes on the skin. Impedance of the \nblack and white sensors above a level of 3k \u038f will negatively influence SQI and thus \naffect  CSI monitoring (Danmeter 2004) . Throughout the entire study period, impedance \nwas kept low (within 1 k \u038f and 3 k \u038f) with the use of wax placed between electrodes \nand the skin, thus allowing us to obtain average SQI values of around 80% over the \ncourse of the study period.  \nThe CSI could be a satisfactory alternative to BIS for monitoring depth of anesthesia  in \nhumans (Hoymork, Hval et al. 2007) . The CSI demonstrates more variability in the 116 \n baseline when compared with BIS. However, both have a high probability of predicting \nloss of consciousness, loss of reflexe s and correlate well with the Modified Observer\u2019s \nAssessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAAS) (Zhong, Guo et al. 2005) . There are \nfew animal studies reporting on monitoring depth of anesthesia  using BIS technology. \nThe BIS monitor appears to have certain limitations when used in animals, especially \nwhen burst suppression is observed after the administration of large doses of anesthetic s \n(March and Muir 2005) . In these studies, the hypnotic agents were essentially \nhalogenated and the results showed BIS\u2019 usefulness to be limited when monitoring the \ndegree of CNS depression (Greene, Benson et al. 2004; Martin -Cancho, Lima et al.  \n2006) . Incre ased concentrations of anesthetic  agents decreased BIS but it could not \naccurately estimate a safe BIS interval for anaesthetising veterinary patients (Lam ont, \nGreene et al. 2005; March and Muir 2005) . In pigs for example, BIS seems to interpret \nburst suppression in the EEG as an indication that the animal is waking up, showing \nhigh BIS value s even during a steady state anesthesia  (Greene, Benson et al. 2004) .  \nThe PropCp decreased after cessation of the propofol bolus according to the estima tes \nperformed by Beths\u2019 pharmacokinetic model (Beths, Glen et al. 2001) . This was \nreflected by a progressive increase in CSI values, indicating a lighter depth of \nanesthesia . Although this correlation has already been shown in humans (Zhong, Guo et \nal. 2005) , this is the first time that it has been reported in dogs.  \nPropofol decreases the arterial blood pressure  by centrally  depressing sympathetic \nneural output, which results in a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (Clayes, Gepts \net al. 1988) . Episodes of hypotensi on (mean arterial pressure <60mmHg) were observed \nin only two dogs in our study for a very brief period of time when PropCp reached its \nmaximum concentration. Other than these two cases, heart rate and mean arterial \npressure were always within normal physi ological limits. Thus, a possible effect of \nsystemic hemodynamic s on cerebral hemodynamic s and on resulting CSI values \nappears unlikely.  \nIn conclusion, cerebral electrical changes induced by increasing and decreasing \npropofol concentrations appear to be d etected by CSI monitoring of dogs during \ninduction of anesthesia . The negative correlation between CSI and PropCp indicates \nthat the CSI could be used to assess electrical brain activity in dogs during induction of \nanesthesia  using propofol and suggests th at it could potentially be used for monitoring \nthe depth of anesthesia  during general anesthetic  procedures. However it must be \nunderlined that CSM is a brain monitor not yet validated for use in veterinary anesthesia  117 \n and, this must therefore be taken into account. Nevertheless, this study shows that CSI \nmonitoring could be a potentially useful tool for accessing the depth of anesthesia  in \ndogs.  118 \n 3.2-Section Two  \nCorrelation between clinical signs of depth of anesthesia  and cerebral state \nindex responses in dogs during induction of anesthesia  with propofol.  \n \nRibeiro, L.M.

Anesthesia  was \ninduced with a 200 ml h -1 propofol 1% c onstant infusion rate until loss  of corneal reflex \nusing RugLoop II software with Beths' pharmacokinetic model to estimate PropCp.  \nPalpebral reflex (PR) and the corneal reflex (CR) were tested every 30s and classified as \npresent (+) or absent ( -), and eyeball position was registered as rotate d ventromedialy \n(ERV) or centred (EC).  \nHeart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CSI values were analyzed from \nbaseline before the beginning of p ropofol infusion (T0) until loss  of CR; CSI and \nPropCp, CSI and anesthetic  planes, and PropCp and anesthetic  planes were compared \nusing correlation analysis.  \n PropCp reached 7.65\u00b12.1 ug ml -1 at the end of the study. CSI values at T0 were \n89.2\u00b13.8. Based on the observation of ocular reflexes and eyeball position, it was \npossible to define five anestheti c planes: A (superficial) to E (deep), being A 119 \n (PR+/CR+/EC), B (PR+/ERV/CR+), C (PR -/ERV/CR+), D (PR -/EC/CR+) and E (PR -\n/EC/CR -). There was a significant correlation between PropCp and the anesthetic  planes \n(R=0,861; P<0.01). No significant correlation was  observed between CSI and the \nanesthetic  planes or between CSI and PropCp. MAP decreased significantly from T0 \nuntil loss  of corneal reflex (from 98\u00b114 mmHg to 82\u00b112 mmHg); HR did not change \nsignificantly (from 101\u00b130 bpm to 113\u00b116 bpm).  \nThe CSI monitoring  was not consistent with the clinical observations observed in the \ndifferent stages of depth anesthesia . This could limit the use of CSI for monitoring \ndepth of anesthesia  with propofol.  \n 120 \n 3.2.2 -Introduction  \nThe concept of depth anesthesia  is dimensionless. Without any objective monitoring, \nthe subjective descriptions `too light\u00b4, `too deep\u00b4 or `enough\u00b4 are not helpful for a \ncareful assessment of the adequate plane of anesthesia  (Pomfrett 1999) . The observation \nof physical signs, such as somatic muscle tone, respiratory patterns and ocular signs \nallowed assigning to a g iven stage of anesthesia  (Heiko 2004) . So far, only ether was \nused to define the clinical stages according to anesthetic  depth (Bhargava, Setlur et al. \n2004)  The development of a brain monitor that can be used in dogs is a real necessity to \nmonitor depth of anesthesia  more objectively. The electroencephalogram (EEG) \nprovides a direct measurement of the functional state  of the brain which makes  the \nmonitoring of increasing anesthetic  depth and the detection of unnecessary depth of \nanesthesia  possible (Lunn, Rosen et al. 1987) . Different EEG patterns such as dec reasing \nEEG frequency and increasing wave amplitude can be observed with increasing \nanesthetic  concentrations. These and other changes can be described and quantified \nstatistically (Miller, Sleig et al. 2004) , and algorithms can be  introduced in EEG \nmonitoring devices and used to access the depth of anesthesia . \nThe Cerebral State Monitor (CSM), an EEG monitor, was recently introduced for \nmonitoring the depth of  anesthesia  in humans, proving to be a useful tool. (Jensen, \nLitvan et al. 2006; Hoymork, Hval et al. 2007) This monitor has not yet been validated \nin dogs but there is a possibility that the Cerebral State Index (CSI) displayed by the \nCSM could be used for EEG monitoring in dogs (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2007) .   \nThe objective of this study is to analyse the correlation between depth of anesthesia  by \nmonitoring ocular reflexes, and CSI and estimated propofol plasma concentrations in \ndogs during induction of anesthesia  with propofol.  121 \n 122 \n 3.2.3 -Methods  \n3.2.3.1 -Patients and hemodynamic  monitoring  \n Fourteen healthy dogs undergoing scheduled routine surg ical procedures were enrolled \nin this study. All dogs were premedicated with 0.05 mg kg-1 Acepromazine IM \n(Calmivet\u00ae, Vetoquinol, France), thirty minutes prior to the beginning of the induction \nof anesthesia . \nA cannula was inserted in the cephalic vein for  drug and fluid administration. A three \nway stopcock was used to connect the intravenous catheter to the propofol and sodium \nchloride 0.9% delivery lines. A Braun infusion pump (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) \nwas used for the administration of  sodium chloride  at a constant infusion rate of 10 ml \nkg-1 hr-1 during the entire study period.  \nAn S/5 Datex monitor (Datex -Ohmeda; Helsinki, Finland) was used for monitoring the \nhemodynamic  parameters. The blood pressure was measured non -invasively in the \nanterior carpus  of the left hind leg using repeated measurements: each measurement was \nmade immediately after the preceding one (Datex S/5 \u201cSTAT\u201d mode). Heart rate was \nmonitored by three ECG electrodes placed according to Academy of Veterinary \nCardiology Committee.  \n \n3.2.3.2-Cerebral state index monitoring  \nThe CSI and frontal electromyographic activity (EMG) data were collected every five \nseconds from a Cerebral State Monitor (CSM) (Danmeter, DK -5000 Odense C, \nDenmark) using three clamp, ECG electrodes (Seitsonen, Yli -Hankala et al. 2000) , \nplaced in standard position in the midline of the head.  The EEG waveform in our study \nwas derived from the signal recorded between the frontopolar electrode \n(positive)represented by the white color and the occipital electrode (negative) \nrepresented by t he black color, according to Pelegrino and colleagues\u2019 studies \n(Pellegrino  and Sica 2004) . The ground or the reference electrode was placed in the \nparietal position. The frequency of the waveform was between 2 -35 Hz and CSM \nmonitor collected 2000 samples sec-1 (14bits equivalent), with an update every one \nsecond.  To calculate the CSI, frequencies outside the 6 -42 Hz range were filtered out  \n(Danmeter 2004) . Impedances were kept low (within 1 k \u038f and 3 k \u038f) by using a special \nwax (Elefix, paste for EEG, Nihon Kohden Corporation) placed between the electrodes \nand the skin.  123 \n The CSI is calculated using four sub -parameters of the electroencephalogram: \uf062 ratio, \uf061 \nratio, \uf062 ratio - \uf061 ratio, and burst suppression. These sub -parameters are used to define \ntwo energ y ratios called alpha ( \u03b1) and beta ( \u03b2). Both \u03b1 and \u03b2 show a shift in the energy \ncontent from the higher to the lower frequencies with deeper anesthesia . This \ninformation can be used to achieve  an index which varies from 0 to 100 (Jensen, Litvan \net al. 2006) .  \nThe monitor also evaluates the amount of instantaneous burst suppression (BS) in each \nthirty -second period that  quantifies the amount of isoelectric waves in the EEG. These \nEEG periods characterise the deepest levels of hypnosis.  \nSignal quality index (SQI) was collected at a constant rate. The SQI is calculated using \nthe quality of the acquired EEG signal and on t he signal artefacts during the previous \none minute period. The electrode -to-skin impedance is included in the SQI calculation. \nThe SQI is displayed numerically as percentage units (0 -100%, 100% equals best signal \nquality). Electrode -to-skin impedances at 1  k\u03a9 result in a SQI of 100. If the impedance \nof the white or black sensors exceeds 1k \u03a9, the SQI will gradually decrease (Danmeter \n2004) . When excessive noise is detected, the SQI is also diminished reflecting the \ndisturbance (Danmeter 20 04). If the sensor impedance is >5k \u03a9 the CSI, BS and EMG \nwill be blank (\u201c - -\u201c displayed) .  \n3.2.3.3 -Anesthetic  protocol  \nRugLoop II\u00ae software (developed by Tom DeSmet (Demed Engineering, Temse, \nBelgium) and Michel Struys (Ghent Univer sity, Gent, Belgium))  running on  a personal \ncomputer was used to drive the propofol syringe pump. The pharmacokinetic model for \npropofol from Beths and colleagues (Beths, Glen et al. 2001)  was incorporated in the \nRugLoop II\u00ae software and was used to estimate the propofol plasma concentrations \n(PropCp). RugLoop II\u00ae was also used to store the pharmacokinetic, hemodynamic  and \nelectroencephalographic data every five seconds.  \nAnesthesia  was induced using a constant infusion rate of 200 ml h-1 of propofol 1% \n(Fresenius Kabi\u00ae; Bad Homburg, Germany). Throughout this period, the animals were \nbreathing 100% oxygen through a face mask. The end point of the propofol \nadministration was the moment when the dogs lost their corneal reflex. However if the \ndogs became apnoeic (did not br eathe for more than 15 seconds) or hypotensive \n(meaning their arterial blood pressure dropped below 60 mmHg) the propofol 124 \n administration  was stopped . After the end of the study the dog was intubated and \nprepared for the scheduled surgery.  \n No stimuli wer e applied at any time to the dogs other than testing reflexes.  \n \n3.2.3.4 -Clinical observation of the depth of anesthesia  \nBefore the induction of anesthesia  and after premedication, the dogs were placed in \nsternal recumbency. The first reflexes were tested when the dogs changed to a lateral \nrecumbence without a cervical tonus after the beginning of the propofol infusion.  \nThe palpebral and corneal reflexes wer e tested every 30 seconds with a  swab moistened \nwith  serum. The palpebral reflex was tested gently at the lateral canthus of the eye, and \ncorneal reflex was elicited by a smooth pressure on the cornea. Each reflex was tested \nthree times and considered ne gative if there was no response to the three taps with the \nswab. The eyeball position was also observed at each test. Thus, palpebral reflex (PR) \nand corneal reflex (CR) were classified as present (+) or absent ( -); the position of the \neyeball was describe d as eyeball rotated ventormedially (ERV) if the pupil was looking \ntowards the middle eye corner, or centred (EC) if the pupil was centred between the \nsuperior and inferior palpebral. The tests were performed by the same operator for all of \nthe dogs  \n3.2.3. 5-Data and statistical analysis  \nThe results obtained from testing the reflexes were analyzed and grouped according to \nthe propofol concent rations and, consequently, with  anesthetic  depth.  A letter \nrepresenting a different plane of anesthesia  was given to each group of reflexes. Data \nwas tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro Wilk test. Heart rate, mean arterial \npressure and CSI values were analyzed from baseline values before the beginning of \npropofol infusion (T0) until the loss of corneal refle x using the Wilcoxon. The \nSpearman Rank correlation analysis was used to compare CSI and PropCp, CSI and \nanesthetic  planes, and anesthetic  planes and PropCp. A delay of 50 seconds in CSI data \nwas taken into account when analyzing CSI data (Pilge, Zanner et al. 2006 ) . Statistical \nanalysis was performed using SPSS v.13.0 for Windows. Data was expressed in \nmean\u00b1sd; |R|>0.5 and P<0.05  was co nsidered statistically significant.  125 \n 126 \n 3.2.4 -Results  \nFourteen mixed breed dogs aged 2.6\u00b10.9 years, including 8 females,  weighing \n25.3\u00b15.28 kg were analysed. The results from prospectively analyzing the ocular \nreflexes indicated five levels of anesthetic  depth (A to E) (table 8 ). CSI decreased f rom \nbaseline to plane E (table 9 ) but no significant correlation was observed between CSI \nand these anesthetic  planes (R=0.26;  Fig 3.2.4.1 ), or between CSI and PropCp) \n(R=0.478). Nevertheless, a strong correlation was observed between PropCp and the \nanesthetic  planes (R=0.887; P<0.01 ). \nIn plane E, all dogs lost their palpebral and corneal reflex, and were intubated with \nlaryngeal reflex absent. At this time point lower EMG values associated with lower CSI \nvalues wer e observed. Four dogs showed high EMG values in this plane associated with \nhigh CSI values.  \nMean arterial blood pressure decreased by 16 % from the baseline to plane E ( P<0.05 ). \nHeart rate did not change signif icantly during the study (Table 9 ). \n \nTable 8-Anesthetic  planes identified based on increasing estimated propofol plasma concentrations in all \ndogs.

Five \ndifferent anesthetic  planes based on the analysis of ocular reflexes were identified in \ndogs under propofol anesthesia . In fact PropCp showed a strong co rrelation with these \nanesthetic  planes and so, different PropCp intervals are proposed in order to achieve a \ndesired depth of anesthesia . On the other hand, CSI decreased with increasing propofol \nconcentrations but there was no correlation between CSI and the depth of anesthesia  \nprovided by the anesthetic  planes in this study. Thus, CSI does not seem to provide \ntrustworthy clinical information for monitoring the depth of anesthesia  in dogs during \nthe induction of anesthesia  with propofol.  \nThe hemodynamic  parameters monitored in this study provided very little information \nabout the depth of anesthesia  when using propofol as hypnotic agent. In fact only mean \narterial pressure decreased by about 16% from baseline to plane E, which is of limited \nclinical use whe n monitoring depth of anesthesia .  \nThe development of a three -compartment pharmacokinetic model for propofol  for dogs \n(Beths, Glen et al. 2001)   allowed the use of TCI in veterinary anesthesia  practice. The \nconcentrations obtained with the propofol constant rate infusion of 200 ml h-1 were \nbased on Beths pharm acokinetic model (Beths, Glen et al. 2001) . Although in our study \nno blood analyses were performed to measure the real propofol concentration in the \nblood, there are studies showing that TCI using this pharmacokinetic model in dogs \nallows a better propofol titration with improved control of anesthetic  depth (Beths, Glen \net al. 2001)  and less undesired side effects (Musk, Pang et al. 2005)  when compared t o \nmanual infusion.  \nThe effects of propofol on the EEG are well described in humans (Sleigh, Steyn -Ross et \nal. 2001) . The administration  of low doses of propofol increases the amplitude and the \nEEG alpha wave rhythm, followed by a shift to EEG gamma and theta frequency. \nHigher doses produce burst suppression and decrease in the EEG amplitude (Jensen, \nLitvan et al. 2006) . A good monitor of depth of anesthesia  should accurately distinguish \nthese EEG changes and correlate them with different anesthetic  depth. The most studied \nmonitor in veterinary science is the bispectral index monitor BIS (March and Muir \n2005) . This monitor seems to have some limitations when used in animals, especially \nwhen burst suppression is observed after the administration of large anesthetic  doses 130 \n (March and Muir 2005) . In these studies, the hypnotic agen ts were essentially \nhalogenated and the results showed  limited BIS usefulness for monitoring the degree of \nCentral Nervous System (CNS) depression (Greene, Benson et al. 2004; Martin -\nCancho, Lima et al. 2006) . Increased concentrations of anestheti c agents decreased BIS \nbut  could not accurately estimate the BIS interval where it is safe to anaesthetise \nveterinary patients (Lamont, Greene et al. 200 5; March and Muir 2005) . For example, in \npigs BIS seems to interpret the burst suppression in the EEG as an indicator of \nawakening, showing high BIS values even during a steady state of anesthesia  (Greene, \nBenson et al. 2004) .  \nIn humans, CSI monitoring has recently been introduced t o monitor the hypnotic state \nof patients during anesthetic  procedures, but demonstrates more variability in the \nbaseline when compared with BIS. However, both monitors have a high probability of \npredicting loss of consciousness, loss of reflexes and good correlations with the \nModified Observer\u2019s Assessment of Ale rtness/Sedation Scale (MOAAS) (Zhong, Guo \net al. 2005) . Jensen and colleagues concluded that the CSI could be a reasonable \nalternative to the BIS monitor. In a previous study, our group proposed the CSI as a \npossible satisfactory alternative to BIS for monitoring depth of anesthesia  in dogs \n(Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2007) . This study showed that the cerebral electrical changes \ninduced by a 6 mg kg-1 bolus dose of propofol was detected by the CSI monitoring of \ndogs during induction of anesthesia . The negative correlation between CSI and PropCp \nsuggested that the CSI could be used to assess electrical brain activity in dogs. \nHowever, results from this stud y indicate that when anesthesia  is induced using a \npropofol constant infusion rate, CSI correlation is lower than the previous study \n(Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2007) . A possible reason for such differences may be related to \nthe time needed to transfer the drug to the effect site. The concentration at the brain in \nthe case of hypnotics depends on the con centration gradient (Musk, Pang et al. 2005 ). \nWhen a bolus of 6 mg kg-1 of propofol is administered, the time lag needed for the \npropofol plasma and effect -site concentrations to reach the equilibrium is small. Thus, \nthe CSI rapidly reflects the propofol concentrations in the brain by showing lo wer CSI \nvalues. In a constant rate of propofol infusion, the propofol plasma concentration \nincreases more slowly. Thus, the gradient of concentration of propofol between the \nplasma and the effect -site is lower, and the time to transfer the drug to the effe ct site is \nlonger. Furthermore, this study showed a higher standard deviation at the maximum \nestimated propofol plasma concentration (7.65\u00b12.16 \u00b5g ml-1) when compared with the 131 \n bolus study ( 7.18\u00b10.39 \u00b5g ml-1). This may be explained by the fact that in this study \npropofol infusion was stopped based on clinical assessments.  \nAccording to the CSI manufacturer, CSI values in humans higher than 90 indicate an \n\u201cawake\u201d brain, between 80 to 70 indicate deep sedation, between 60 and 40 indicate \ngeneral anesthesia  and below 40 indicate excessive anesthesia  (Danmeter 2004) . As we \ncan see in table 2, the CSI values are far from correlating with these intervals. \nFurthermore CSI had no correlation with propofol -estimated plasma concentrations and \nno correlat ion with the clinical signs of the anesthetic  planes referred in this study.  \nIt is known that EMG activity is the most significant source of EEG artefact. Despite \nthe fact that the CSI algorithm also incorporates an EMG filter that removes most of the \npotential interfering EMG activity, the EMG still has a significant influence on the CSI \nvalue (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . The influence of EMG in dogs may be particularly \nimportant due to the amount of muscles in the head compared with humans. In an \nattempt to diminish the influence from EMG produced by temporal muscles electrodes \nwere placed in the mid -line. The influenc e of EMG on the CSI values was a constant \nobservation in our study and it seems to be the main reason for the high standard \ndeviation observed in the CSI values during the anesthetic  planes C, D and E (Table2).  \nIsoelectric EEG periods interrupted by brief  periods of high amplitude EEG activity \nindicates a non -specific reduction in cerebral metabolic activity  known as burst \nsuppression (Rampil 1998) . Onset of burst suppression has historically been associated \nwith a surgical plane of anesthesia  (stage III, planes 2 and 3) (March and Muir 2005) . In \nour study, the BS was observed in three out of  the four dogs that had values of CSI \nbelow 40 and happened more consistently in plane E of anesthesia  where all dogs lost \ntheir corneal reflex.  \nAnother important parameter to take into account when using CSI monitoring is the \nSQI. The SQI represents the quality of the received EEG signal. The calculation of SQI \nis based on a series of artefacts that occur during each one -minute period. The SQI is \nalso influenced by the impedance of the electrodes in the skin. Impedances of the  black \nand white electrodes superior to 3k \u038f will negatively influence SQI and thus affect CSI \nmonitoring (Danmeter 2004) . During the entire study period, impedances were kept low \n(within 1 k \u038f and 3 k \u038f) by using wax placed between electrodes and the skin.  \nPropofol decrease s the arterial blood pressure by central depression of sympathetic \nneural output, which results in a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and potential \nhypotension (Clayes, Gepts et al. 1988) . Studies in sheep show that rapid injection of 132 \n propofol for the induction of anesthesia  produces more effects on cardiovascular \nsystems than a slower infusion rate (Zheng, Upton et al. 1998) . In our study, no \nhypotensive episodes were observed and mean arterial blood pressure showed an \naverage maximum decrease of 16% from \u201cawake\u201d values to the deepest anesthetic  stage \nobserved (Plane E). Heart rate was also within physiologic normal range during the \nentire study.  The slow rate of propofol infusion (a constant infusion of 200 ml min-1) \nand the dogs\u2019 weight of over 20 kg may help to explain the hemodynamic  stability.  \nIn conclusion, this study proposes five anesthetic  planes based on objective eyeball \nposition and r eflex observations during induction of anesthesia  with propofol. The \nperformance of CSM was not consistent with the clinical observations on the different \nplanes of depth of anesthesia . This may limit its use during the induction of veterinary \nroutine anesthesia . The good hemodynamic  stability provided by some hypnotic agents \neven at higher concentrations, as seems to occur with propofol, provides little clinical \ninformation for monitoring depth of anesthesia  and strengthens the need for an EEG \nbased monito r for veterinary use. Until then, it seems that clinical reflexes still provide \nuseful information that cannot be minimized. Nevertheless, these reflexes are of limited \nclinical value when using myorelaxant drugs during general anesthesia .  133 \n 3.3-Section Th ree \n \nCorrelation between clinical signs of depth of anesthesia  and cerebral state \nindex responses in dogs with different target -controlled infusions of \npropo fol. \nL\u00e9nio M.Ribeiro a; David A.Ferreira  b;Susana Br\u00e1s b; Jose M.Gonzalo -Orden c;Luis M. \nAntunes b. \n \n \na CECAV, Hospital Veterin\u00e1 rio do Porto, Porto, Portugal  \nb CECAV, Universidade de Tr \u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal  \nc Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria,Universidad L\u00e9on, Departamento de cirurgia e \nRadiologia  L\u00e9on, Spain  \n \n3.3.1 -Abstract  \nObjective   To evaluate if  the  Cerebral State Index (CSI), measured by a Cerebral State \nMonitor (CSM),  can predict depth of anesthesia  as assessed clinically, or estimated \npropofol plasma concentrations.  \nStudy d esign    Prospective clinical study.   \nAnimals  Fourteen mixed breed dogs, weiging 24.5 \u00b1 4.7 kg, scheduled to underg o \nneutering procedures.  \n Methods   Dogs were premedicated with 0.05 mg kg-1 acepromazine intramuscularly.  \nThe CSM and cardiovascular monitoring equipment were attached. Anesthesia  was \ninduced with propofol using a target controlled infusion (TCI) to varying plasma \npropofol targets (PropCp).  Following endotracheal intubation the dogs were ventilated \nwith oxygen.  Anesthetic  maintenance was with propofol by TCI. A PropCp of 3 \u00b5g dL-\n1 was set initially, then PropCp s were i ncreased in 1 \u00b5g dl-1 steps to 7, 9  and then 11 \u00b5g \ndL-1.  Each PropCp was held constant for a 5 minute period, at the end of which depth \nof anesthesia  was classified using a previously evaluated scale of \u2018planes\u2019 ba sed on \npalpebral and corneal reflexs and eye position.  Cerebral state index (CSI), burst \nsuppression (BSR) and  electromyogram were measured at these time points. The 134 \n Prediction Probability (PK) of these variables, or of the PropCp in predicting depth of \nanesthesia  was calculated.  \nResults   The PKs for predicting anesthetic  planes were 0.74, 0.91, 0.76 and 0.78 for \nCSI, BSR, EMG and PropCp, respectively.  The PKs for PropCp to predict CSI, BSR \nand EMG were 0.65, 0.71 and 0.65, respectively.  \nConclusion and clinical relevance  The Cerebral State Monitor was able to detect very \ndeep planes of anesthesia  when BSR occurs, but was not able to distinguish between the \nintermediate anesthetic  planes likely to be used in clinical anesthesia . \n 135 \n 3.3.2 -Introduction  \nIt is difficult to assess the depth of anesthesia  during balanced anesthesia  using both \nanesthetic  and neuromuscular blocking agents, and even in humans, hemodynamic  \nchanges do not always detect intraoperative awareness (Rampil 2001) . The \nelectroencephalogram (EEG) provides a direct measure of the functional state of the \ncerebral cortex which makes it possible to monitor increasing anesth etic depth and \ndetect if anesthesia  is unnecessarily deep (Lunn, Rosen et al. 1987) . Different EEG \npatterns can be observed with increasing anesthetic  concentrations.  \nIn humans (Kiyama and Takeda 1997; Gajraj, Doi et al. 1998)  and in animals (Antunes \net al. 2003; Otto 2008)  the analysis of the EEG with methods based on power spectrum \nanalysis showed no correlation with depth of anesthesia .  However, in humans the \nBispectral Index (BIS) is used very successfully to provide a scale of hypnosis. In \nveterinary  medicine, the efficacy of BIS monitoring in assessing the depth of anesthesia  \nin dogs (Muir , Wiese et al. 2003) , cats (March and Muir 2003)  and pigs (Martin -\nCancho, Lima et al. 2006)  has been studied, but in animals the correlation between EEG \ndepression and the BIS index is unclear, especially when burst suppression is observed \nafter the administration of large anesth etic doses (March and Muir 2005) . This may \nreflect the fac t that \u201cBIS\u2019 calculations use data collected from 5000 human EEG studies \ncollected during anesthetic  procedures (Johansen and Sebel 2000)  which makes its \napplicability difficult between species.  \nThe Cerebral State Monitor (CSM) is a fuzzy logic based analysis from the EEG \nmonitor and has been used for monitoring the depth of anesthesia  in humans (Jensen, \nLitvan et al. 2006; Hoymork, Hval et al. 2007) . The main advantage of this method  is \nthat because the relationship between the EEG and the clinical state cannot be eas ily \nmodeled by a mathematical function, the  fuzzy logic analysis has the potential to  offer a \nbetter alternative to establish this relationship  (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) .  In a previous \nstudy carried out in our laboratory (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2008)  an intravenous (IV)  \npropofol bolus of 6 mg kg-1 resulted in a progressive decrease in Cerebral State Index \n(CSI) values displayed by the CSM, and a slight negative correlation between the \nplasma target concentration (PropCp)  and CSI was observed. This suggested the \npossibility that CSM could be useful in monitoring depth of anesthesia  in dogs. \nHowever, in a subsequent study in which propofol was given by a continuous infusion \nof 200 mL hour-1 to induce anesthesia  to varying clinical depths, t he CSI was not 136 \n consistent with clinical observations of the depth of anesthesia  reached  during these \ninfusions (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) .  The objective of this current study is to \nevaluate CSM correlation with different estimated propofol steady state plasma \nconcentrations and clinical anesthetic  planes in dogs during maintenance of anesthesia . \n \n 137 \n 3.3.3 -Methods  \nAll procedures were approved by a local ethics committee, and fully informed consent \nfor data collection, for altering the planes of anesthesia  and for enrolment in research \nwas given by the owners.  \n \n3.3.3.1 -Dogs and hemodynamic  monitoring  \nWe previously reported the CSM performance during induction of anesthesia  with \npropofol in 14 dogs (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) .  This current report is of the \ncontinuation of anesthesia  with propofol in these subjects. All dogs were scheduled for \na routine neutering procedure and were considered healthy based on clinical history, \nclinical examination and blood analysis (packed cell volume, total protein and blood \nurea).  \nAll dogs were premedicated with 0.05 mg kg-1 acepromazine IM (Calmivet\u00ae, \nVetoquinol, Fra nce) 30 minutes prior to the beginning of the induction of anesthesia . A \ncannula  (18 gauge ) was inserted in the cephalic vein for drug and fluid administration. \nA three way stopcock was used to connect the  IV catheter to the propofol and sodium \nchloride 0. 9% delivery lines. Sodium chloride at a constant infusion rate of 10 mL kg-1 \nhour-1 was administered during the entire study period via an infusion pump.  \nA S/5 Datex monitor (Datex -Ohmeda, Finland) was used for monitoring the \nhemodynamic  parameters. Blood pressure was measured non -invasively in the cranial \nmetatarsal region of the left hindlimb, and mean arterial pressures are reported. Cuff \nwidth was chosen to be around 40% of circumference of the limb .  Three measurements \nwere obtained and used to calculate the average value made immediately after the \npreceding one (Datex S/5 \u201cSTAT\u201d mode). A lead II electrode ECG was monitored.    \n.  \n3.3.3.2 -Cerebral state index monitoring.  \nThe CSM used was the same as that employed in the previous stud ies (Ribeiro, Ferreira \net al. 2008) .  The electrodes were already in position for the induction of anesthesia  \n(Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009)  and were left in place. The bipolar EEG waveform in our \nstudy was derived from the signal recorded between the frontopolar electrode (positive), 138 \n and the occipital electrode (negative), as described by (Pellegrino  and Sica 2004) . The \nground or the reference electrode was placed  in the parietal position (Fig.25 ). \n  \n \nFigur e 25-Electrodes placement for EEG recording  \nDorsal view of canine cranium showing the placement of the EEG recording electrodes.  \n Fp  (frontopolar electrode), P (parietal electrode) and O (occipital electrode);  \n \n \nA modified ECG cable with clamp electrodes, connected to the CSM cable, was used to \nprovide these electrodes. Before the application of clamp electrodes the skin was \ncleaned with alcohol 5 minutes before the data collection to allow drying.   \nThe CSM displ ays the EEG signal continuously, and also four parameters derived from \nEEG analysis, CSI, BS, EMG and SQI. Details of how these parameters are derived has \nbeen described fully in our previous work (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) .  CSI is based \non a combination of four sub -parameters of the electroencephalographic signal: \u03b2 ratio, \n\u03b1 ratio, \u03b2-\u03b1 ratio and burst suppression (BS). T he CSI is displayed in a scale from 0 to \n100 that represents the  different depths of anesthesia . The BS is defined as the \npercentage of time in a 30 -second window where the amplitude of the \nelectroencephalographic signal was less than 3.5\u00b5V . These EEG periods characterise \nthe deepest levels of hypnosis. The SQI is calc ulated using the quality of the acquired \n139 \n EEG signal and on the signal artefacts during the previous 1 -minute period. The \nelectrode -to-skin impedance is included in the SQI calculation. High levels of facial \nmuscular or electromyographic (EMG) activity can interfere with the CSI under certain \ncircumstances. The monitor incorporates an EMG filter that removes most of the \npotential interfering EMG activity. The EMG bar shows the energy of the EMG level in \nthe 75 \u201385 Hz frequency band (0 \u2013100 logarithmic scale).   \nThe EEG data collection ended before the patient was moved to the appropriate position \nfor the commencement of surgery.  \n3.3.3.3 -Anesthetic  protocol  and clinical observations  \nRugLoop II  software (developed by  Tom DeSmet (Demed Engineering, Belgium) and \nMichel Struys (Ghent University, Belgium)) running on a personal computer was used \nto drive the propofol syringe pump. The pharmacokinetic model incorporated in the \nRugLoop II software and used to estimate the propofol plasma concentrations was that \nof Beths  et al. (Beths, Glen et al. 2001) . RugLoop II was also used to store the \npharmacokinetic, hemodynamic  and electroencephalographic data every 5 seconds.  \nThirty  minutes after premedication, anesthesia  was induced  with propofol 1% \n(Fresenius Kabi; Germany) using a constant rate of infusion (CRI) of 200 mL hour-1 \nuntil various planes of anesthesia  were achieved. CSI was measured during this \ninduction as previously described  (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) .  Once this previous \nstudy was compl eted, the trachea was intubated  and the dogs were mechanically  \nventilated  with 100% oxygen in order  to maintain the end -tidal CO 2 between 35 -\n45mmHg (4.6 -6 kPa).  All dogs were positioned in left lateral recumbency during the \nentire study period. T he propofol target control infusion (TCI) was  then initialize d by \nswitching the  infusion mode  in the RugloopII from CRI  to PropCp . An initial plasma \ntarget of 3 \u00b5g dL-1 was set.  It required (mean \u00b1 SD) 9.5  \u00b1 2.4 minutes for the initial \nhigh plasma concentrations of propofol achieved during induction of anesthesia  to \ndecrease . During this period the Rugloop II software control stopped the infusion and \nwhen the estimated correct value was reached, the pump was automatically re -started \nand the plasma target of 3 \u00b5g dL-1 was maintained for 5 minutes. At  the end of this 5-\nminute period , reflex testing to assess anesthet ic depth commenced.  140 \n Reflex testing was as described in our previous study (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) . The \npalpebral and corneal  reflexes of the  right eye were tested three times with a swab \ndamped with serum. The reflexes were considered negative if there were no response to \nthese three stimulations. The palpebral reflex was tested gently at the lateral canthus of \nthe eye, and the corneal reflex was elicited by a smooth pressure on the cornea. The \neyeball position was observed.  The ocular reflexes were grouped in anesthetic  \u2018planes\u2019 \nof depth, A to E as described previously (Ribeiro,  Ferreira et al. 2009)  and in table 10 . \nOnce the reflexes had been tested, the PropCps  were increased in  1\u00b5g dL-1 steps every 5 \nminutes to 7\u00b5g dL-1, and then increased to 9 \u00b5g dL-1, then to 11\u00b5g d L-1 . These PropCps  \nwere each maintained for 5 minutes af ter each step increase.  The same procedure s were  \napplied for evaluating the reflexes at the end of each 5 minute step. If mean arterial \nblood pressure decreased below 60 mmHg, the propofol administration was stopped.  \nAfter the end of the study a TCI of 3 \u00b5g dL-1 was set and a bolus of fentanyl 5 \u00b5g  kg-1 \nwas administered before surgery commenced. At the end of the surgery carprofen 4 mg \nkg-1 SC and a single dose of morphine 0.4 mg kg-1 SC were administered.   \n \n3.3.3.4 -Data and statistical analysis.  \nThe effica cy of electroencephalogram parameters to predict depth  of anesthesia  was \nevaluated using prediction probability (PK). The mathematical basis of PK was as \ndescribed by Smith et al (Smith, Dutton et al. 1996) . A PK value of 1 means that the \nvalues of the predicting variable , e.g., anesthetic  depth indicator, correctly predict s the \nvalue of the observed anesthetic depth. A PK value of 0.5 means that the values of the \nindicator predict no better than a 50 \u201350 chance.  The PK calculation was performed \nusing the program PKMACRO.   \nData for h eart rate, mean arterial pressure and CSM da ta (CSI, BS, SQI and EMG) are \ndescribed  as means \u00b1 SD  for each anesthetic  plane . Data showed as a box plot: 25th \nand 75th percentile are the boxes\u2019 borders; whiskers are the lowest and highest values \nfor the 5th and 95th percentiles, respectively. The t ime delays for  the CSI calculation  \nranged  from 53 to 55  seconds  (Pilge, Zanner et al. 2006 ). In our analysis, a  delay of 50 \nseconds in CSI data was taken into account when analyzing CSI data . 141 \n 3.3.4 -Results  \nThe subjects were 14 dogs, of mixed breeds, 8 females and 6 males, aged 2.6 \u00b1 1 years, \nand weight 24.5 \u00b1 4.67 kg. One dog was exclude d from data analysis because it showed \nan anomalous EEG flat line throughout the whole study period.  \nTwo dogs required initial PropCp  doses of 5 and 6 \u00b5g dL-1 respectively  to maintain \nanesthesia , as the target 3 \u00b5g dL-1 was insufficient . Depth of anesthesia  in one dog did \nnot reach anesthetic  plane E even at 11 \u00b5g dL-1. \nThe plane of anesthesia  (as defined by Table 1 0) increased with administration of \nincreasing PropCp , but the  five separate planes were not observed in all dogs. In most \nsuch cases d epth of anesthesia  increased, missing a plane (eg. from C to E). However, in \none dog the plane decreased from D to C despite an increased PropCp .   \nThe hemodynamic  and electroencephalographic data and its relationship with the \nidentified anesthetic  plane s are shown in Table 11 . The results demonstrate that CSI \ndistinguished plane C and E from the baseline (awake). Only four dogs passed through \nplane D which impaired the analysis. EMG decreased with the depth of anesthesia , and \nat plane E was minimal.   \nThe PK for CSM parameters related with anesthetic  planes and  PropCp are described in \nTable 12 .  The prediction probability (PK) for CSM parameters to be related with \nanesthetic  planes were at intermediate values in the region of 0.75. Thus the monitor did \nnot always predict increases or decreases in the depth of anesthesia . The lowest \nprobability observed was between CSI and PropCp; the PK between PropCp and \nanesthetic  planes was higher (PK=0.78).  The highest value for PK was for BSR (PK \n=0.91) related to anesthetic  planes. When BSR was analyzed with PropCp the PK \ndecrease to a value of 0.71. At deep levels of anesthesia  the CSI was sensitive to burst \nsuppression, 12 dogs reached the plane E and eight of them showed burst suppression \n(BS) the percentage BS duri ng plane E was on average 11%.  Burst suppression was \nalso observed in planes C and D in two dogs with low values, less than 3%.  \nFigure 2 demonstrates the relationship between the CSI and clinically assessed \nanesthetic  planes. The CSI showed a tendency to  decrease with increasing propofol \nconcentrations and increased anesthetic  depth. However it did not differentiate the \nintermediate anesthetic  planes.  Although a great difference was observed in plane E - \nthe deepest levels of anesthesia , considerable ove rlap between CSI values obtained at \nthe different anesthetic  planes was observed.  142 \n Table 10-Anesthetic  planes identified with increasing PropCp (target propofol plasma concentrations) in \n13 dogs, in which anesthesia  was first induced, then maintained  by propofol CRI.   \n \nAnesthetic  planes  Ocular reflexes  \nA PR+/EC/CR+  \nB PR+/ERV/CR+  \nC PR-/ERV/CR+  \nD PR-/EC/CR+  \nE PR-/EC/CR - \n \nThe anesthetic  planes were allocated a letter A to E, according to the anesthetic  depth based on the \npresence (+) or absence ( -) of ocular reflexes and the position of the eye: palpebral reflex (PR), corneal \nreflex (CR) eyeball centred in the eye (EC) and eyeball rotated ventrally (ERV).  \n \n \nTable 11-Hemodynamic  and electroencephalographic data observed before induction of anesthesia  \n(baseline) and when the dogs were at anesthetic  planes A to E . \n  CSI EMG (%)  BS (%)  SQI (%)  HR(bpm)  MAP (mmHg)  \nBaseline  89 \u00b1 3  94 \u00b1 11  0.0 63 \u00b1 21  101 \u00b1 30  98\u00b114  \nAnesthetic  \nplanes         \nA 88 \u00b1 13  68 \u00b1 27  0.0 87 \u00b1 8  99 \u00b1 23  91 \u00b1 23  \nB 79 \u00b1 17  52 \u00b1 31  0.0 78 \u00b1 11  88 \u00b1 19  84 \u00b1 15  \nC 57 \u00b1 16  20 \u00b1 30  0.1 \u00b1 0.4  82 \u00b1 14  87 \u00b1 20  83 \u00b1 13  \nD 59 \u00b1 18  24 \u00b1 22  0.8 \u00b1 1.7  78 \u00b1 17  98 \u00b1 25  88 \u00b115  \nE 42 \u00b1 14  6 \u00b1 16  11.2 \u00b1 18.8  88 \u00b1 10  94 \u00b1 17  79 \u00b1 17  \n \nCSI (Cerebral state index), EMG (Electromyography), BS (Burst suppression), SQI (Signal quality \nindex),  HR (Heart rate) and MAP ( Mean arterial pressure).

Overlap between CSI values obtained in \ndifferent anesthetic  planes  is observed.  \n \n \n144 \n 3.3.5 -Discussion  \n \nThe CSM calculates the CSI and uses four subparameters derived from the time  domain \nanalysis (burst ratio) and frequency domain analysis ( \u03b1-ratio, \u03b2-ratio, \u03b2-ratio - \u03b1-ratio) of \nthe EEG. To deliver an index these subparameters are used as inputs to a fuzzy logic \nanalysis. Fuzzy logic is a problem -solving control system methodology that \nincorporates a simple, ruled -based  \u201cIf X and Y then Z\u201d approach to solving a control \nproblem rather than attempting to model a system mathematically (Jensen, Litvan et al. \n2006) . \nIn humans the CSM monitor has been studied using the Modified Observer\u2019s \nAssessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (OAA/S)  (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . \nHowever, in veterinary practice there is no sedation scale accepted universally, and \nstudies are difficult to perform in animals using loss of consciou sness or loss of righting \nreflexs as assessment points without interfering with the collection of the EEG signal. In \nour previous study we identified a scale of anesthetic  depth based on ocular reflexes \n(Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) .  In this earlier study in which propofol was infused at a \nconstant rate to induce anesthesia  and then to increase depth to the planes of anesthesia  \nidentified in the scale, results with the CSM monitor were disappointing as, although \nthere was some correla tion between CSM and estimated propofol plasma \nconcentrations, the CSM  did not predict anesthetic  planes accurately. As it is possible \nthat this failure was because a steady state propofol concentration had not been reached \nat the effector cells, the objec tive of this current continuation study was to re -evaluate \nthe CSM performance, this time during maintenance of anesthesia  with propofol with \ndifferent target concentrations. A monitor of depth anesthesia  can only be called \naccurate if it (1) provides an a ccurate correlation with cerebral drug concentration, (2) \ncorrelates with the clinical state of the patients, and (3) informs the clinician when \nexcessive levels of anesthesia  are present (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . In our study, \nthese three aspects were analyzed.  \nThe first condition for CSM  was not met as the PK value was 0.65 which means that the \nmonitor did not always predict increments or decrements in the amount of propofol. The \nanalysis was carried out 5 minutes after propofol was anticipated to have reached the \nselected plasma target co ncentration. At the end of each propofol stage, it was assumed \nthat the PropCp was similar to the propofol concentration at the effect site  This 145 \n assumption was based on the half -life for the propofol plasma -effect -site equilibration \nbeing around 2.3 minut es for humans (Kazama, Ikeda et al. 1999) . Musk et al in studies \nwith TCI allowed three minutes for the equilibration between blood and drug site \naction (Musk, Pang et al. 2005) .   \nA potential reason for the poor correlation between CSI and PropCp  in this study \ncompared with the previous work (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009)  is that a different \nmethod of statistical analysis was employed.  A further reason could be the application \nof Beths\u2019 pharmacokinetic model (Beths et al. 200 1). The model is derived from a \npopulation sample of dogs, with its inevitable variations between real and target plasma \nconcentrations of propofol. In humans a 20 -30% variation between real and target \npropofol plasma concentration can be acceptable clinic ally for TCI use (Coetzee, Glen \net al. 1995; Fechner, Albrecht et al. 1998) . However, the Prop Cp based on Beths\u2019 \npharmacokinetic model could be even more variable as a result of the great breed \nvariability in the dog population. It important to refer that in the Beth`s model the \nperformance of the TCI was evaluated with the administration of an opi oid and in \npresent study the acepromazine alone was used for premedication (Beths, Glen et al. \n2001) . \nIn our study no analyses were performed to measure the real propofol concentration in \nthe blood.  \n Regarding the second condition, the present study showed that the sequential  \nincrease of the anesthetic  depth from plane A to E was followed by a decrease in CSI \nvalues, but the CSI did not distinguish accurately between the anesthetic  planes B, C \nand D as the CSI values were overlapped. Although CSI seems to provide useful \ninforma tion at the deepest levels of anesthesia  when burst suppression occurs; its \nclinical usefulness was limited because it could not provide reliable clinical information \nduring intermediate levels of anesthesia . \nEMG activity is the most significant source of EEG artefact (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . \nThe influence of EMG in dogs may be particularly important due to the amou nt of \nmuscles in the head compared with humans. The influence of EMG on the CSI values \nwas a constant observation in our study and could be another reason for the low  values \nobtain for PK.   \nThe CSM appeared to detect the excessive levels of anesthesia  that were reached at \nplane E.  Some studies in humans also suggest that the CSI has a better performance \nthan BIS in detecting deep levels of anesthesia  adequately (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . 146 \n Burst suppression refers to isoelectric periods interrupted by brief intervals of high \namplitude EEG activity. An isoelectric EEG pattern is continuous, uninterrupted by \nburst activi ty. This pattern is developed during deep anesthesia  (Rampil 1998; Greene, \nBenson et al. 2002) . In dogs, an increase in suppression ratio could lead to paradoxical \nincreases of BIS values (BIS>60) (March and Muir 2005) . Nevertheless, this was not \nobserved in our  study, in which burst suppression was observed frequently during plane \nE at the time of the lowest CSI values. During burst suppression, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 ratio are no \nlonger monotonously decreasing as a function of anesthetic  depth and therefore they \ncannot be used in the calculation of the final index (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) .  \nThe hemodynamic  parameters were monitored in this study to ensure that the dogs were \nnot harmed by the increasing depth of anesthesia . However, they provided very little \ninformation regarding depth of anesthesia . It is known that propofol decreases the \narterial b lood pressure by central depression of sympathetic neural output, which results \nin a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and potential hypotension (Clayes, Gepts  et \nal. 1988) . The velocity of the propofol infusion is also a very important factor \ninfluencing hemodynamic  effects (Br\u00e1s, Bressan et al. 2009) . In our study, dogs showed \na surprisingly stable hemodynamic  profile, the maximum decrease of MAP being 24% \nfrom baseline i n plane E. This hemodynamic  stability when propofol is infused may \nlimit the usefulness of hemodynamic  data for monitoring depth of anesthesia  and \nstrengthen the need for a EEG based monitor for veterinary use, but in this current study \nno painful stimuli were administered so the cardiovascular response to surgery was not \ninvestigated.  \nIn conclusion, this study evaluates the use of the CSM in detecting depth of anesthesia  \nwith propofol as scaled in five previously identified anesthetic  planes (Ribeiro, Ferreira \net al. 2009) .  Although there is some prediction probability between CSI values and the \nanesthetic  planes, the CSI showed clinically important limitations as it was not able to \ndistinguish between anesthetic  planes B, C, and D (ie  those depths likely to be used in \nclinical practice), as CSI values overlapped. A lthough CSI was able to detect deeper \nlevels of anesthesia  when burst suppression occurs, it would be hoped that such deep \nlevels would not normally be reached. However, the burst suppression was a consistent \nfinding in deep planes of anesthesia , and this fact could be relevant for the use of Fuzzy \nlogic analysis in future monitors.  147 \n Chap ter 4  \n4.1-Global summary of results  \nIn general the results from this thesis point for limited capacity of the CSM monitor to \ndetect  accurately different anesthetic  planes representing clinical signs observed and \ndifferent concentrations of propofol.  \nAlthough CSI seems to be able to detect very deep levels of anesthesia  when burst \nsuppressi on occurs, it would be expected  that such levels would not normally be \nreached  under general anesthesia .  \nAnesthestic planes observed during the studies seems to be a useful tool in the future to \nassess the performance of brain EEG based monitors  \nIn partic ular the results of these studies represent different ways to evaluate the \nperformance of the CSM monitor under different protocols for propofol administration. \nFurthermore, in the latter two studies the monitor was also evaluated based on clinical \nendpoin ts using ocular reflexes based on the developed visual clinical scale. Specific \nresults from this work may be divided in the following headings:  \n4.1.1 -CSI response to predicted plasma propofol  concentration  infused  \nIn the first study during the induction of anesthesia  with a propofol bolus of 6mgKg-1 a \nsignificant negative correlation was observed between CSI and PropCp (correlation \ncoefficient of -0.57;  P<0.01) . In the second study when a  propofol 200ml-1infusion w as \nused to achieved the anesthetic  planes desired, no correlation was observed between \nCSI and PropCp (R=0,47).In the third study, during maintenance of anesthesia with \ndifferent target controlled infusions of propofol, the PK between CSI and PropCp  was \n0,65. All these results represent a poor correlation between the CSI and the estimated \ndrug concentration.    \n4.1.2 - CSI relation with  clinical end points  \nThe results obtained from the ocular reflexes analyses indicated five possible clinical \nlevels of anesth etic depth (A to E) . These anesthetic planes were essential for \ndeveloping the first visual objective clinical scale to monitor depth of anesthesia  in dogs \nunder general anesthesia  with propofol, and to evaluate the CSM monitor performance \nin the subsequen t studies.  148 \n In the second study, during induction of anesthesia  with propofol 200ml/h, no \nsignificant correlation were observed between CSI and anesthetic  planes  despite the CSI \ndecreases from baseline to plane E. Nevertheless, it was observed a strong corr elation, \nor prediction probability between anesthetic planes  of the clinical scale and PropCp \n(R=0.887; P<0.01 ).  \n In the third study, the  PK between PropCp and anesthetic  planes  was high (PK=0,78) .  \nPrediction probability showed intermediate values near 0 ,75 between  CSM parameters \nand anesthetic  planes . This means that the monitor did not always predict increments or \ndecrements in the level of anesthesia . \n4.1.3 -CSM monitor performance evaluation at de ep levels of anesthesia . \nThe detection of the deep level s of anesthesia and burst suppression is one of the biggest \nvirtues of the CSM monitor when applied to dogs.  \nIn the first study only three dogs present burst suppression, related with the lower values \nof CSI. In the second study, i n plane E, all dogs lost their palpebral and corneal reflex, \nand were intubated with laryngeal reflex absent. At this time point lower EMG values \nassociated with lower CSI values were observed.  With the exception of one dog that \nhave burst suppression in plane C and D, the BSR was  only observed in plane E.  \nIn the third study t he highest value observed for PK was between  BSR (PK =0,91) and \nanesthetic  planes . When BSR was related to PropCp , the PK decrease d to 0,71. At deep \nlevels of anesthesia  the CSI was sensitive to burst suppres sion: twelve dogs reached the \nplane E , and CSM detected the excessive depth of anesthesia  in eight of them , by \nrevealing an average of 11% of burst suppression (BS) . Burst suppression was also \nobserved in Planes C and D in two dogs with BS values less than 3%.  \nThe influence  of the EMG in the CSI values was a constant finding during all studies, \nand it seems to be the main reason for the high standard deviation observed in the CSI \nvalues during the anesthetic  planes C, D and E . \nIn the first study EMG values higher than 30% were observed in seven dogs at \nmaximum PropCp , and in five dogs at minimum CSI values . \nIn the third study  was interesting to verify that EMG decreases with the increment in \ndepth of anesthesia , and showed a  high correlation  with CSI  (R=0,80) . \nHemodynamic  variables were not a concern and did not influence the studies of \nanesthetic  depth.  In the first study t here was a 13% decrease in mean arterial pressure \n(P<0.05 ) and a 17% increase in heart rate ( P<0.05 ) between awake value s and those 149 \n values recorded at maximum PropCp .  In the second study m ean arterial blood pressure \ndecreased by 16 % from the baseline to plane E ( P<0.05 ). Heart rate did not change \nsignificantly during the study . In the third study m ean arterial blood press ure and heart \nrate did not change significantly , with the exception for MAP in plane C were the \ndifference was significantly ( P<0.05 ) from the baseline . Nevertheless, mean arterial \nblood pressure did not decrease below the minimum threshold value of 60 mmH g in any \nstudy, which could have compromised the cerebral autoregulation and influence the \nresults  \n 150 \n Cap\u00edtulo  4 \n4.1.Resumen global de los resultados  \nLos resultados obtenidos por nosotros muestran que la capacidad del monitor CSM es \nmuy limitada cuando queremos determinar con precisi\u00f3n diferentes planos anest\u00e9sicos y \nque adem\u00e1s nos los relacione con los signos cl\u00ednicos observados cuando utilizamos \ndiferentes concentraciones de propofol en la anestesia de perros.  \n Aunque el CSI se muestra efectivo en el p lano m\u00e1s profundo de la anestesia \n(plano E), cuando se produce la BS, este plano anest\u00e9sico no se alcanza normalmente en \nlas anestesias que hacemos en la cl\u00ednica diaria.  \n Los resultados concretos de esta memoria podemos agruparlos en los apartados \nsiguientes:  \n \n4.1.1 - Respuesta del CSI a la  concentraci\u00f3n  plasm\u00e1tica previsible de \npropofol.  \nEn el primer estudio durante la inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia con un bolo de propofol de \n6mgKg-1 se observ\u00f3 una correlaci\u00f3n negativa significativa entre CSI y PropCp \n(coeficiente de correlaci\u00f3n de -0.57; P < 0,01).  \nEn el segundo estudio cuando se utilizo una infusi\u00f3n de propofol de 200 ml-1 para \nalcanzar los planos anest\u00e9sicos deseados, no se observ\u00f3 ninguna correlaci\u00f3n entre CSI y \nPropCp (R = 0, 47).  \nEn el tercer estud io, durante el mantenimiento de la anestesia con infusiones de distintas \nconcentraciones de propofol, el PK fue 0,65 cuando se estudio la relaci\u00f3n del CSI con \nPropCp.  \nTodos estos resultados representan una baja correlaci\u00f3n entre la CSI y la concentraci\u00f3n  \nestimada de propofol.  151 \n 4.1.2 - Relaci\u00f3n de CSI con los reflexos oculares  observados en los perros . \n \nLo primero fue establecer una escala visual de los reflejos oculares para relacionarlos \ncon los cinco planos de profundidad anest\u00e9sica (A, B,  C, D, E), cuan do anestesi\u00e1bamos \na perros con propofol.  \nEn el segundo estudio, durante la inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia con propofol 200 ml/h, no se \nobserv\u00f3 ninguna correlaci\u00f3n significativa entre CSI y planos anest\u00e9sicos a pesar de las \ndisminuciones CSI desde el plano A has ta al plano E.  \nSin embargo, se observ\u00f3 una fuerte correlaci\u00f3n, o probabilidad de predicci\u00f3n entre \nplanos anest\u00e9sicos de la escala cl\u00ednica y la PropCp (R = 0.887; P < 0,01).  \nEn el tercer estudio, la PK entre PropCp y los planos de anest\u00e9sicos fue alta (PK  = 0, \n78).  \nEl uso de PK mostr\u00f3 valores cercanos al 0,75 cuando estudiamos la relaci\u00f3n entre CSI \ncon planos de anest\u00e9sicos. Esto significa que el monitor no siempre es capaz de \nindicarnos incrementos o disminuciones del nivel de anestesia.  \n4.1.3 - Evaluaci\u00f3 n de desempe\u00f1o de monitor CSM en la anestesia profunda .  \n \nLa detecci\u00f3n de niveles de anestesia y la BSR es una de las mayores virtudes del \nmonitor CSM cuando se aplica a los perros.  \nEn el primer estudio s\u00f3lo tres perros presentan BSR, relacionada con los v alores \ninferiores de CSI.  \nEn el segundo estudio, en el plano E, todos los perros pierden su reflejo palpebral y \ncorneal y fueron intubados con reflejo lar\u00edngeo ausente. En esta fase los valores EMG \nm\u00e1s bajos est\u00e1n asociados con los valores m\u00e1s bajos de CSI . \nCon la excepci\u00f3n de un perro que presentaba BSR en los planos C y D, el BSR s\u00f3lo se \nobserv\u00f3 en el plano E en los dem\u00e1s perros.  \nEn el tercer estudio el valor m\u00e1s alto observado de PK (PK = 0,91) fue para BSR \nrelacionados con los planos anest\u00e9sicos.  Cuando BSR se analiz\u00f3 relacionado lo con la \nPropCp, el PK disminuy\u00f3 a 0,71.  \nEn niveles de anestesia profundos el CSI es sensible a la BSR . Doce perros alcanzaron \nel plano E, y  el  CSM  (Cerebral State Monitor ) detect o la excesiva profundidad de 152 \n anestesia en  ocho de ellos, presentando un promedio del 11% BS.  La BS tambi\u00e9n se \nobserv\u00f3 en los planos C y D en dos perros con valores inferiores a 3%.  \nLa influencia del EMG en los valores de CSI fue una constante en todos los estudios,  \nasi el primer estudio se obser varon valores de EMG superiores al 30  % en siete perros \nen PropCp m\u00e1ximo y en cinco perros en valores m\u00ednimos de CSI.  \nEn el tercer estudio fue interesante comprobar que el EM G disminuye con el incremento \nde la profundidad de  la anestesia y mostro  una alta correlaci\u00f3n con el CSI (R = 0, 80).  \nLas variables hemodin\u00e1micos no eran objeto prioritario de estudio  en estos trabajos  y \nlos resultados obtenidos confirman que las variables hemodin\u00e1micas no estaban \nrelacionadas con la profundidad anest\u00e9sica.  \nEn el prime r estudio, hubo una disminuci\u00f3n de 13% en la presi\u00f3n arterial media (P < \n0,05) y un aumento de 17% en la frecuencia cardiaca (P < 0,05) cuando se compraban \nlos valores medidos en los animales despiertos y los valores registrados en PropCp \nm\u00e1xima.  \nEn el seg undo estudio la presi\u00f3n arterial media disminu\u00eda un 16% cuando se \ncomparaban los valores obtenidos cuando el a nimal estaba sin anestesia con  los \nobtenidos cuando el animal estaba en el plano E (P < 0,05). La frecuencia card\u00edaca no \ncambi\u00f3 significativamente  durante el estudio.  \nEn la tercer estudio la presi\u00f3n arterial y ritmo card\u00edaco no cambiaron significativamente \nen los diferentes planos de anestesia., con la excepci\u00f3n de la presi\u00f3n arterial media en el \nplano de anestesia C, con una diferencia fue significativa (P < 0,05) resp ecto al valor  \nmedido al comienzo de la inducci\u00f3n anest\u00e9sica. Sin embargo , cuando la presi\u00f3n arterial \ncayo  por debajo de  60 mmHg , ese animal se elimino  del estudio.  \n 153 \n Chaper 5  \n5.1 General discussion  \nIn current  veterinary anesthesia one of the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d is to find a monitor to \nassess the depth of anesthesia. The deleterious effects of the awareness in companion \nanimal are difficult to establish  (Haskins 1996) , but these  events could modify the \nbehavior and the q uality of lif e for animals and it is an important welfare matter . The \nevaluation of the depth of anesthesia  based on clinical observation, ocular reflexes, \nmovement, mandibular tonus is completely useless when neuromuscular blocking \nagents are being used. Thus,  the accurate assessment  of the depth of anesthesia  will be a \nmajor contribute to the  standardization of animal care, in clinical practi ce and in \nresearch aiming  at achieving an adequate anesthetic protocol.  \nAt the beginning of the time frame of this  thesis the CSM had recently been \nintroduced as an intra -operative monitor of anesthetic  depth (Zhong, Guo et al. 2005) . \nThe basic CSM analysis uses the collected EEG as input variables to a fuzzy logic \nanalysis. This methodological approach seems to be the best way to quantify the depth \nof anesthesia  in dogs with a previously dev eloped human monitor because this  monitor \nestablishes the relationship between variables based on a no n-restricted mathematical \nstructure . The data is analy zed with no prior assumption of the mathematical \nrelationship  which me ans that the monitor does not assume an underlying mathematical \nmodel governing the relationship between the anesthetic drugs and the response effect  \n(Gambus, Jensen et al. 2010) . Another reason to use this monitor was the fact that this \nwas a novel small handheld monitor that derives the EEG from three forehead  \nelectrodes , but with a connector that makes it possible  to use ordinary ECG elect rodes \nwith snap connectors. This allows an easy application and  it is also an inexpensive way \nof using electrodes in clinical practice (Seitsonen, Yli -Hankala et al. 2000) .  \nThe efficacy of depth of anesthesia  monitoring devices are not the same for the \nquantification of sedation, measuring the effect site concentration of anesthetics and \ndetection the level of consciousness (Bruhn, Myles et al. 2006) . These variables require \ndifferent calibration points and scales that should be analyzed based on a graded dose of \nanesthetics.  \nIn order to evaluate the applicability of the CSM monitor to veterinary \nanesthesia,  some requirements have to be present:  a) accurate correlation with cere bral 154 \n drug concentration,  b) accurate correlation with the clinical  state of th e patients, and c) \nto inform the clinician when excessive levels of anesthesia are present (Jensen, Litvan et \nal. 2006) . In the present thesis all of these  aspects were analyzed.  \nThe effect of the propofol in the brain i s expected to gradually augment  with \nincreasi ng drug concentrations, which should be directly reflected on the EEG index. \nHowever, in all of our studies this was not exactly observed. The highest value had a \npredicted probability of 0,65 for the relation between CSI values and the PropCp during \nthe maintenance of anesthesia with different PropCp. It must be taken in to account that \nPK value of 1.0 means an  exact prediction , while a PK of 0.5 is no better than  a 50:50 \naccuracy. Thus, the PK value of 0,65 is considered a low value for prediction \nprobability in this case.     \nA potential reason for the poor correlation between CSI and PropCp in our \nstudies  could be the appl ication of the Beth\u00b4s model. This model is depict ed from a \ndogs \u2019 population sample, with its inevitable variations between real plasma \nconcentrations of propofol and plasma target concentration (PropCp). In humans it was \nobserved that 20 -30% v ariations between propofol plasma concentrations and PropCp \ncould be clinically acceptable for TCI use (Coetzee, Glen et al. 1995; Fechner, Albrecht \net al. 19 98). Although one of the main limitations during this study could be the lack of \nquantification of the real propofol concentration in the blood, the PropCp used were \nestimated by a reliable pharmacokinetic model used in several international scientific \npublications .  \nThe PropCp had better correlation and predicted probability with clinical \nendpoints, rather than with CSI which could be a safe way of monitoring depth of \nanesthesia  while there are no reliable depth of anesthesia  monitors for veterinary use..  \nIn the discussion of our results, we must take in to account that when a human \nmonitor is used to evaluate the dogs EEG patterns the accura cy could be diminished. \nFor example, when the BIS m onitor was applied to monitoring the depth of anesthesia \nin pigs , it seems to interpret burst suppression in the EEG as an indication that the \nanimal is waking up, showing high BIS values (Greene, Benson et al. 2004) . Another \nfactor that may be related to this poor correlation is the EMG, which is the most \nsignificant source of EEG art ifact. Variations in EMG activity are associated with rapid \nchanges in B IS values in dogs (Greene, Benson et al. 2002) . Despite the fact that the \nCSI algorithm also incorporates an EMG filter that removes most potentially interfering \nEMG activity, the EMG still has a significant i nfluence on the CSI algorithm  (Jensen, 155 \n Litvan et al. 2006) . The influence of EMG in dogs may be particularly importan t due to \nthe amount of muscles in the head compared to humans. The influence of EMG on the \nCSI values was a constant observation in our study and it seems to be the main reason \nfor the high standard deviation obs erved in the CSI values in the second study.  In the \nthird study it was observed a PK of 0,8 between EMG and CSI.  \nWhen the performance of the CSM monitor was evaluated during induction of \nanesthesia , and based on the clinical state of the patient it was not observed a significant \ncorrelation between CSI and anesthetic planes. However, when dogs were anaesthetized \nwith TCI,  a sequentially increase in the anesthetic  depth from plane A to E followed by \na decrease in CSI values  was observed . The PK obtained was 0,74 which means that \nCSI cannot distinguis h accurately the anesthetic  levels B, C and D because CSI values \nwere overlapped  at different anesthetic  planes . The main reason for the differences \nbetween both studies may be related with t he influence of EMG on the CSI va lues, \nbecause during induction o f anesthesia  at 200ml/h  higher EMG values were observed \nin planes C, D and E, than in the third study where TCI was used.  \nIt is fundamental for the clinician  to know when excessive levels of anesthesia \nare present , and burst suppression plays an importan t role in this context.  Burst \nsuppression refers to isoelectric periods interrupted by brief intervals of high amplitude \nEEG activity.  This pattern is developed during deep anesthetic  levels  (Rampil 1998; \nGreene, Benson et al. 2002) . The burst suppression was frequently observed during \nplane E in both studies , and was associated with the  lowest CSI values whe n the \nmajority of the dogs  lost their corneal reflex.  In fact, it is important to highlig ht the 0.91 \nPK value observed between  BSR  and anesthetic  planes .  \nThe hemodynamic parameters monitored in this study provided very little \ninformation regarding depth of anesthesia  when using propofol. It is known that \npropofol decreases the arterial blood pressur e by central depression of sympathetic \nneural output, which results in a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and potential \nhypotension (Clayes, Gepts et al. 1988 ). The velocity of the propofol infusion is also a \nvery important factor that influences the propofol hemodynamic effects  (Br\u00e1s, Bressan \net al. 2009) . In our studies , dogs showed stable hemodynamic  profile The good \nhemodynamic stability provide d by propofol limits the  usefulness of hemodynamic data \nfor monitoring depth of an esthesia , and strength ens the need for a n EEG based monitor \nfor veterinary use.  156 \n Cap\u00edtulo  5  \n5.1 Discusi\u00f3n general  \nEn anestesia veterinaria el encontrar un monitor que nos mida la profundidad \nanest \u00e9sica de forma eficiente y fiable se ha convertido en la b\u00fasqueda del \u201cSanto \nGrial\u201d.  \nEs imposible la evaluaci\u00f3n de la profundidad de la anest\u00e9sica basada en la \nobservaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica, reflejos oculares, movimiento ocular, tono mandibular,  etc., cuando \nse utilizan bloqueante s neuromusculares.  \nPor lo tanto, la evaluaci\u00f3n de objetiva de la profundidad anest\u00e9sica ser\u00e1 una gran \nayuda en la normalizaci\u00f3n del cuidado de los animales, en la pr\u00e1ctica cl\u00ednica y en la \ninvestigaci\u00f3n para garantizar el adecuado protoc olo anest\u00e9sico.  \nAl comienzo de esta tesis el CSM se hab\u00eda introducido recientemente como un \nmonitor intraoperatorio de profundidad anest\u00e9sica (Zhong, Guo et al 2005).  \nEl an\u00e1lisis b\u00e1sico del CSM utiliza las variaciones del electroencefalograma \ndurante la a nestesia, que despu\u00e9s son analizadas seg\u00fan de la l\u00f3gica difusa. Este enfoque \nmetodol\u00f3gico parece ser la mejor manera de cuantificar la profundidad de la anestesia \nen perros , utilizando  un monitor humano previamente desarrollado, porque el monitor \nestablece  la relaci\u00f3n entre las variables bas\u00e1ndose en una estructura matem\u00e1tica no \nrestringida. (Gambus, Jensen et al 2010).  \nOtra raz\u00f3n por la que elegimos este monito r fue que es peque\u00f1o , que se \ntransporta con facilidad, y que solo utiliza tres electrodos en la o btenci\u00f3n d el EEG , \nsiendo adem\u00e1s posible el utilizar electrodos de ECG normales , de f\u00e1cil aplicaci\u00f3n y \nbarat os  (Seitsonen, Yli -Hankala et al 2000).  \nLa eficacia de los dispositivos que monitorizan  la profundidad de la anestesia, \nno es la misma para la cuan tificaci\u00f3n de sedaci\u00f3n, que para medir la concentraci\u00f3n del \nf\u00e1rmaco en el \u201ceffect site\u201d de los anest\u00e9sicos y para detecci\u00f3n del nivel de conciencia \n(Bruhn, Myles et al 2006). Cada una de estas variables requiere puntos de calibraci\u00f3n \ndiferentes.  \nPara evalua r la aplicabilidad del monitor CSM en anestesia veterinaria, los \nvalores obtenidos del \u00cdndice deben cumplir algunas premisas:  \na. Exacta correlaci\u00f3n del \u00cdndice con la concentraci\u00f3n del f\u00e1rmaco en el \ncerebro,  157 \n b. Exacta correlaci\u00f3n del \u00cdndice con el estado cl\u00ednico  de los pacientes.  \nc. El \u00cdndice obtenido debe indicar al cl\u00ednico cuando existe n niveles \nexcesivos de anestesia , o cuando aumenta o disminuye la profundidad de \nla anestesia.  (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006).  \nEn la presente memoria presentada para obtener el grado  de doctor se analizaron \ntodos estos aspectos.  \nEsper\u00e1bamos que el efecto de propofol en el cerebro aumentara gradualmente \ncon el aumento de las concentraciones del f\u00e1rmaco, y que por otro lado, estos cambios \nse debier \u00edan reflejar se directamente en el \u00edndic e obtenido a partir de los cambios del \nEEG. Sin embargo, en todos nuestros estudios esto no se ha observ\u00f3 exactamente. El \nvalor m\u00e1s alto ten\u00eda un PK de 0,65 para la relaci\u00f3n entre los valores de la CSI y la \nPropCp durante el mantenimiento de la anestesia c on diferentes PropCp. Debe tenerse \nen cuenta que el valor PK 1,0 significa una predicci\u00f3n exacta siempre, mientras que un \nPK de 0.5 no es mejor que una precisi\u00f3n de 50:50 . Por lo tanto, el valor de PK de 0,65 \nse considera un valor bajo de probabilidad de p redicci\u00f3n.  \nUna raz\u00f3n posible para la baja correlaci\u00f3n entre CSI y PropCp en nuestros \nestudios podr\u00eda ser la aplicaci\u00f3n del modelo Beth\u00b4s. Este modelo se obtuvo con \nmuestras de una poblaci\u00f3n de perros, pero ten\u00eda inevitables variaciones entre las \nconcentrac iones en plasma real de propofol y  la  concentraci\u00f3n plasm\u00e1tica de destino \n(PropCp).  \nEn los seres humanos se observ\u00f3 que variaciones de un 20 -30% entre las \nconcentraciones en plasma propofol y PropCp eran cl\u00ednicamente aceptables para uso \nTCI (Coetzee, Gle n et al. 1995; Fechner, Albrecht et al. 1998).  \nSin embargo nosotros seguimos pensando que una de las principales \nlimitaciones de este estudio pudo ser la falta de cuantificaci\u00f3n de la concentraci\u00f3n de \npropofol real en la sangre , y que tendr\u00edamos que profu ndizar  en la  farmacocin\u00e9tica del \npropofol ( Beths, T y col. 2001,  \nTambi\u00e9n debemos tener cuenta que cuando se u tiliza  un monitor para evaluar los \npatrones EEG en perros , que esta calibrado para usarse en el hombre , la precisi\u00f3n p uede  \ndisminuir.  \nLa  PropCp tuvo una  mejor correlaci\u00f3n y un PK mas alto con los signos cl\u00ednicos \nde la escala bas ada en los reflejos oculares, que con el CSI, por lo que consideramos que \nesta evaluaci\u00f3n es una manera mas segura de controlar la profundidad de la anestesia \nmientras no encontremos un monitor fiable que sirva para medir la profundidad  158 \n anest\u00e9sica para uso veterinario. Por ejemplo, cuando el monitor BIS se aplic\u00f3 a la \nevaluaci\u00f3n de la profundidad de la anestesia en cerdos, los resultados suministrados \nparec\u00edan i nterpretar el BS en el EEG como una indicaci\u00f3n de que el animal se est\u00e1 \ndespertando, mostrando valores elevados de \u00edndice biespectral (BIS) . (Greene, Benson \net al. 2004). Otro factor que puede estar relacionado con esta baja correlaci\u00f3n es el \nEMG, que es l a fuente m\u00e1s importante de artefactos de EEG, Las variaciones en la \nactividad de EMG se asocian con r\u00e1pidos cambios en los valores de BIS en perros \n(Greene, Benson et al. 2002). A pesar de que el algoritmo CSI incorpora un filtro de \nEMG que elimina la mayo r\u00eda de la actividad EMG, todav\u00eda puede interferir, y tener una \ninfluencia significativa en el algoritmo del CSI (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006).  \nLa influencia de EMG en perros puede ser particularmente importante debido a \nla cantidad de m\u00fasculos que hay en la  cabeza del perro en comparaci\u00f3n con los seres \nhumanos. La influencia de EMG en los valores del \u00edndice CSI fue una observaci\u00f3n \nconstante en nuestro estudio. En el tercer trabajo, se observ\u00f3 un PK de 0,8 entre EMG y \nCSI. \nEn el siguiente estudio s e administr o propofol en infusi\u00f3n constante de 200 \nml/hora en concentraci\u00f3n del 1%. En este trabajo se introdujeron los signos cl\u00ednicos, \nreflejos oculares, posici\u00f3n del globo ocular, etc. con el fin de observar la correlaci\u00f3n \nentre las concentraciones plasm\u00e1ticas est imadas de propofol y los signos cl\u00ednicos \nobservados durante la inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia. Sin embargo el rendimiento del \n\u201cCerebral State Monitor\u201d, no se corresponde con las observaciones cl\u00ednicas en los \ndiferentes planos de profundidad anest\u00e9sica.  \nDurante  el mantenimiento da la anestesia con TCI (Target controlled infusions) \nen que se  aumento secuencialmente el PropCp se observ\u00f3 un incremento de la \nprofundidad anest\u00e9sica desde el plano A al plano  E, seguido por una disminuci\u00f3n en los \nvalores del \u00cdndice d e Estado Cerebral (CSI). El PK obtenido fue de 0,74 lo significa que \nel CSI no puede distinguir con precisi\u00f3n entre los planos anest\u00e9sicos, B, C y D, porque \nlos valores del \u00edndice  se superponen en diferentes planos anest\u00e9sicos.  \nLa principal raz\u00f3n de las diferen cias entre ambos estudios puede estar \nrelacionada  con la influencia de EMG en los valores del CSI, porque durante la \ninducci\u00f3n de la anestesia com propofol a una velocidad de 200 ml/h se observaron \nvalores EMG mayores en los planos, C, D y E, que en  el tercer estudio donde se utiliz\u00f3 \nel TCI  159 \n Es fundamental para el cl\u00ednico saber cuando esta en planos  profundos de la \nanestesia y en ellos la BS (Burst supresi\u00f3n)  desempe\u00f1a un papel importante.  \nLa BS se refiere a per\u00edodos isoel\u00e9ctrico interrumpidos por b reves intervalos de \nactividad del EEG de gran amplitud. Este patr\u00f3n se desarrolla durante los niveles de \nanestesia profunda (Rampil 1998; Greene, Benson et al. 2002).La BS se observ\u00f3 con \nfrecuencia durante el plano E en ambos estudios y se asoci\u00f3 con los v alores m\u00e1s bajos \ndel \u00cdndice (CSI), que era cuando la mayor\u00eda de los perros perdi\u00f3 su reflejo corneal. De \nhecho, es importante destacar el valor de PK 0.91 observado entre BSR y los planos \nanest\u00e9sicos.  \nLos par\u00e1metros hemodin\u00e1micos analizados en est a memoria  proporcionan muy \npoca informaci\u00f3n en cuanto a la profundidad de la anestesia conseguida con la \nadministraci\u00f3n de  propofol. Se sabe que el propofol disminuye la presi\u00f3n arterial de la \nsangre por que produce depresi\u00f3n simp\u00e1tica central, que da como resultado  una \ndisminuci\u00f3n en la resistencia vascular sist\u00e9mica y una potencial hipotensi\u00f3n (Clayes, \nGepts et al. 1988).  La velocidad de la infusi\u00f3n de propofol tambi\u00e9n es un factor \nimportante que influye en los efectos hemodin\u00e1micos producidos por el propofol (Br\u00e1s , \nBressan et al 2009).  \nEn nuestros estudios, los perros mostraban un perfil hemodin\u00e1mico estable.La \nbuena estabilidad hemodin\u00e1mica observada durante los estudios realizados por nosotros \nen la anestesia con propofol en perros limita la utilidad de los datos  hemodin\u00e1micos \npara controlar la profundidad de la anestesia y refuerza la necesidad de desarrollar un \nmonitor basado en las modificaciones del EEG para uso veterinario.  \n 160 \n Chapter 6  \n6- General conclusion.  \nIn human medicine, m onitors of depth of anesthesia are currently used and  \ncommercially  available. Such monitors accurately detect the variation in terms of \nconcentrations of drugs and clinical endpoints.   \nDuring the development of this thesis, one of the main problems dealt with was the \nimpossibility of a chieving reliable clinical endpoints to measure the depth of anesthesia. \nIn an attempt to overcome this problem it was developed an objective visual clinical \nscale to evaluate the depth of anesthesia based on ocular reflexes. The results obtained \nshowed th at this scale could be a useful tool to ass ess depth of an esthesia in dogs.  \nThe main conclusions from the investigational studies in this thesis are:  \n1. The establishment of a visual objective clinical scale based on the assessment of \nocular reflexes, for monitoring the depth of anesthesia in dogs;  \n2. The ECG electrodes could be used to collect the EEG signal since low skin -\nelectrode impedances indicating rel iable skin -electrode contact with skin , were \nobtained after carefully prepar ation  with both abrasion paste and alcohol ;  \n3. Cerebral electrical changes induced by increasing and decreasing propofol \nconcentrations in dogs appear to be detected by CSI monitorin g during induction \nof anesthesia  with propofol;  \n \n4. During induction of anesthesia  the performance of CSM was not consistent with \nthe clinical observations on the different planes of depth of anesthesia . This may \nlimit its use during the induction of veterinary routine anesthesia ; \n \n5. The CSI values and the anesthetic  planes proposed  showed a good prediction \nprobability when TCI at very different anesthetic targets was used. However ,  \nthe CSI revealed  impor tant clinical limi tations because i t was not able to \ndistinguish between intermediate planes of anesthesia;  \n \n6. The CSM is able to detect deeper levels of anesthesia  when burst suppression is \npresent;   \n 161 \n 7. The EMG is an important variable to take in account sinc e the performance of \nthe CSM monitor could be greatly affected by this type of electrical activity;  \n \n8. TCI showed to be a user -friendly technique, making it easier to change the \nanesthetic planes desired by the anesthesiologist. Its use will probably increa se \nin general veterinary anesthesia practice, since it is a good methodology to \nperform TIVA;  \n \n9. Hemodynamic s provides few  clinical information for monitoring the depth of \nanesthesia , because good hemodynamic  stability was observed with  propofol \neven at very high concentrations . \n \n6.1- Future research  \nDuring this researh  it became clear that the approach should be the development of a  \nmonitor of  depth of anesthesia  just to be used in veterinary patients. The  optimal \nmonitor of depth of  anesthesia will be one that integrates multivariables that are \ndisplayed in the monitor, and interpreted according to the anesthesia moments. Monitors \nthat combine both spontaneous and evoked cerebral electrophysiologic  signals  are now \nunder investigation for humans (Horn, Pilge et al. 2009) . Probably the EMG could be \nused as a part of the signal, where the EMG\u2019s  usefulness is related to the immediate \nactivation of the frontal muscle , which in turn is  related to inadequate anesthesia , \nimminence of regaining consciousness and strong nocioception  (Viertio -Oja, Maja et al. \n2004) . In the future , the equipment to measures cerebral drug effect  will be considered \nas an integral part of the anesthetic  monitoring set up. This will allow the  \nanesthesiologists to be capable  of differ entiat ing and quantifying  the various anesthetic  \ndrug effects . 162 \n Cap\u00edtulo 6  \n6- Conclusiones . \n1.- La buena estabilidad hemodin\u00e1mica proporcionada por el propofol, incluso en altas \nconcentraciones, proporciona poca informaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica para controlar la profun didad \nanest\u00e9sica.  \n \n2.- El establecimiento de una escala cl\u00ednica objetiva visual para ev aluar la profundidad \nde la anestesia basada en los reflejos oculares puede ser una herramienta \u00fatil para \nconocer la profundidad anest\u00e9sica en perros, ya que no encontram os otros signos \ncl\u00ednicos m\u00e1s fiables y mejores para medir la profundidad anest\u00e9sica.  \n \n3.- Los electrodos utilizados en la realizaci\u00f3n de un electrocardiograma se pueden \nutilizar para recoger la se\u00f1al del electroencefalograma desde valores bajos de las \nimpedancias piel -electrodo, pero hay que tener especial cuidado en conseguir un buen \ncontacto, y haber preparado antes la piel con limpieza y alcohol.  \n \n4.- Cambios el\u00e9ctricos cerebrales inducidos por la variaci\u00f3n de concentraciones del \npropofol en la etapa  de inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia se detectan en el \u00cdndice de Estado \ncerebral (CSI) medido por el \u201cCerebral State Monitor\u201d (CSM) . \n \n5.- Sin embargo el rendimiento del CSM no mostraba relaciones constantes y fiables \ncon las observaciones cl\u00ednicas en los diferent es planos de profundidad anest\u00e9sica, lo que \nlimitar\u00eda su uso al periodo de inducci\u00f3n anest\u00e9sica en anestesias de rutina.  \n \n6.-  Los valores del \u00cdndice de Estado cerebral (CSI) medido por el \u201cCerebral State \nMonitor\u201d (CSM)  muestran una alta probabilidad de re laci\u00f3n (PK) con los planos \nanest\u00e9sicos obtenidos, cuando suministramos diferentes concentraciones de propofol \ncon el TCI (Target controlled infusions), pero no era capaz de distinguir los planos \nintermedios de anestesia.  \n \n7.- El \u201cCerebral State Monitor\u201d (C SM) e s capaz de detectar y funcionar con planos \nprofu ndos de anest esia cuando existe BS ( Burst supresi\u00f3n).  163 \n  \n8.- La electromiograf\u00eda es una t\u00e9cnica que hay que tener en cuenta porque la eficacia del \nmonitor CSM puede verse afectada por este tipo de actividad el\u00e9ctrica.  \n \n9.- En nuestra experiencia el TCI es una t\u00e9cnica f\u00e1cil de usar, pero todav\u00eda tiene que \nmejorar y avanzar para conseguir mejores monitores para medir los diferentes planos  \nde profundidad anest\u00e9sica, y que su desarrollo se adapte para pacientes veterinarios.  \n \n6.1-Futuras investigaciones  \nDurante nuestras investigaciones qued\u00f3 claro que el enfoque futuro debe ser el \ndesarrollo de un monitor de profundidad anest\u00e9sica dise\u00f1ado s\u00f3lo para pacientes \nveterinarios.  \nMonitores que combinan se\u00f1ale s de electrofisiolog\u00eda cerebral espont\u00e1nea y \npotenciales evocados est\u00e1n ahora desarroll\u00e1ndose para los seres humanos (Cuerno, Pilge \net al. 2009).  \nEl monitor \u00f3ptimo para medir la profundidad de la anestesia ser\u00e1 uno que integre \nmultivariables que se muestre n en el monitor y que se puedan interpretar y relacionar \ncon los diferentes planos de anestesia.  \nProbablemente el EMG podr\u00eda utilizarse como parte de la se\u00f1al, porque como \nhemos visto el EMG est\u00e1 relacionado con la activaci\u00f3n del m\u00fasculo frontal, que a su  vez \nest\u00e1 relacionada con la anestesia inadecuada, y la inminencia de recuperar la conciencia \ny fuerte nociception (Viertio -Oja, Maja et al 2004).  \nEn el futuro, estos  monitores que nos cuantifican el efecto de las drogas en el \ncerebro se considerar\u00e1n com o parte integrante del control de la anestesia. Esto permitir\u00e1 \na los anestesi\u00f3logos ser capaces de diferenciar y cuantificar los efectos de las drogas \nanest\u00e9sicas.  \n 164 \n Reference s: \n \nAdragna, M. G.
