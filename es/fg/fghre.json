But is there something wrong with you if you don\u2019t?\nShort answer: not at all.\nBecause people experience the influence of the Holy Ghost differently. That\u2019s what\u2019s so miraculous about the Holy Ghost\u2019s messages: they are made just for you.\nFor some people, the Holy Ghost may cause them to feel overwhelmed with emotion and moved to tears. For others, tears rarely or never come. And that\u2019s okay. For them, the Holy Ghost may produce a subtle feeling of gratitude, peace, reverence, or love (see\n[Galatians 5:22\u201323](http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/gal/5.html?verse=22-23#p22)).\nThe scriptures also describe the Holy Ghost as a \u201cburning\u201d in the bosom (see\n[Doctrine and Covenants 9:8\u20139](http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.html?verse=8-9#p8)). But the intensity or degree of that \u201cburning\u201d can be different for everyone. Sometimes it\u2019s like a small glowing ember instead of a raging bonfire.\nOr perhaps you\u2019ve heard the Holy Ghost described as a \u201cstill small voice\u201d (see\n[Doctrine and Covenants 85:6](http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/85.html?verse=6#p6)). And you immediately thought: \u201cBut I haven\u2019t HEARD a voice. Is something wrong with me?\u201d\nAgain, not at all. That scriptural description doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we all hear a literal voice. Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught that \u201cthe Spirit speaks words that we feel. These feelings are gentle, a nudge to act, to do something, to say something, to respond in a certain way.\"1\nThe point is: each of us will experience the Holy Ghost differently. And in different degrees. What\u2019s important is that we live worthy to receive it and recognize it when it comes. As we do, we\u2019ll begin to notice that His influence is present in our lives a lot more than we expected.\nNotes\n1. Ronald A.
