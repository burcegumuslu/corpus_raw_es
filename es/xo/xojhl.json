Eleven male professional futsal players were assessed before (pretraining) and after (posttraining) a 5-wk period. Assessments included 5'-5' and Yo-Yo IR1 and IR2 performances and HR and HRV at rest and during the IR and 5'-5' tests. Magnitude-based-inference analyses examined the differences between pre- and posttraining, while relationships between changes in variables were determined via correlation. Posttraining, Yo-Yo IR1 performance likely increased while Yo-Yo IR2 performance almost certainly increased. Submaximal HR during the Yo-Yo IR1 and Yo-Yo IR2 almost certainly and likely, respectively, decreased with training. HR during the 5'-5' was very likely decreased, while HRV at rest and during the 5'-5' was likely increased after training. Changes in both Yo-Yo IR performances were negatively correlated with changes in HR during the Yo-Yo IR1 test and positively correlated with the change in HRV during the 5'-5'. The current study has identified the Yo-Yo IR2 as more responsive for monitoring training-induced changes of futsal players than the Yo-Yo IR1. Changes in submaximal HR during the Yo-Yo IR and HRV during the 5'-5' were highly sensitive to changes in maximal performance and are recommended for monitoring training. The 5'-5' was recommended as a time-efficient method to assess training adaptations for futsal players.\n[Yo-Yo Intermittent Endurance Test-Level 1 to monitor changes in aerobic fitness in pre-pubertal boys](http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/2262377470) [DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nFernandes, Lu\u00eds; Krustrup, Peter; Silva, Gustavo\n2016-01-01\nAbstract The present study aimed to examine the performance and heart rate responses during the Yo-Yo Intermittent Endurance Test-Level 1 (Yo-Yo IE1) in children under the age of 10.

J Strength Cond Res 30 (11): 3187-3193, 2016-Gaelic football is indigenous to Ireland and has similar locomotion profiles to soccer and Australian Football. Given the increasing attention on long-term player development, investigations on age-related variation in Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-YoIR1) performance may provide useful information in talent identification, program design, and player monitoring. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate Yo-YoIR1 performance across Gaelic football age groups. Male participants (n = 355) were recruited from division one, Gaelic football teams. Participants were allocated to one of the 7 groups according to respective age groups from under 13 (U13), under 14, under 15 (U15), under 16 (U16), minor, under 21 (U21), to senior age groups. Total Yo-YoIR1 distance (m) increased progressively from U13 (885 \u00b1 347 m) to U16 (1,595 \u00b1 380 m) equating to a rate of change of 180.2%. In comparison to U13, total distance at minor (1,206 \u00b1 327 m) increased by 136.4%. Subsequent increases were observed in U21 (1,585 \u00b1 445 m) and senior players (2,365 \u00b1 489). Minimum (800-880 m) and maximum (2,240-2,280 m) total distances were comparable for U15, U16, and U21 players. Differences in total distance (m) for all age groups were statistically significant when compared to U13 players (p age groups for total distance was deemed to be large (effect size > 0.8). Similar trends were observed for maximum velocity and estimated V[Combining Dot Above]O2max. The evolution of Yo-YoIR1 performance in Gaelic football players from adolescents to adulthood highlights how maturation may influence sport-related running ability. Changes in Yo-YoIR1 performance should be closely monitored to optimize interventions for individuals transitioning across age groups.\n[Electro-Mechanical Modeling and Performance Analysis of Floating Wave Energy Converters Utilizing Yo-Yo Vibrating System](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=46117623) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nSim, Kyuho; Park, Jisu; Jang, Seon-Jun\n2015-01-01\nThis paper proposes a floating-type wave energy conversion system that consists of a mechanical part (yo-yo vibrating system, motion rectifying system, and power transmission system) and electrical part (power generation system).

Both groups were tested for values of CV, D', Yo-Yo IR1 distance and 30-m sprint time on two separate occasions (pre and post intervention). The ST group performed a concurrent 6-week upper and lower body strength and soccer training, whilst the SO group performed a soccer only training. after the re-test of all variables, the ST demonstrated significant improvements for both, YoYo IR1 distance (p = 0.002) and CV values (psoccer training significantly improves CV, Yo-Yo IR1 whilst moderately improving 30-m sprint performances in non-previously resistance trained male soccer players.

The local quench is produced by joining two identical CFT\u2019s on semi-infinite lines. When these theories have a zero boundary entropy, we use the AdS/Boundary CFT proposal to describe this process in terms of bulk physics. Boundaries of the original CFT\u2019s are extended in AdS as dynamical surfaces. In our holographic picture these surfaces detach from the boundary and form a closed folded string which can propagate in the bulk. The dynamics of this string is governed by the tensionless Yo-Yo string solution and its subsequent evolution determines the time dependence after quench. We use this model to calculate holographic Entanglement Entropy (EE) of an interval as a function of time. We propose how the falling string deforms Ryu-Takayanagi\u2019s curves. Using the deformed curves we calculate EE and find complete agreement with field theory results.\n[Farkl\u0131 Asitliklerdeki Yo\u011furtlardan Torba Yo\u011furdu \u00dcretimi ve Natamisinin Raf \u00d6mr\u00fc \u00dczerine Etkisi](http://dergipark.gov.tr/gidader/issue/6982/93050?publisher=gidadernegi) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nNuray Sahan\n2015-02-01\nFull Text Available Bu ara\u015ft\u0131rmada, \u00e7i\u011f s\u00fcte natamisin ilave edilerek ve edilmeyerek farkl\u0131 asitlikteki yo\u011furtlardan torba yo\u011furdu \u00fcretilmi\u015ftir. +4 oC' de ve 5 g\u00fcnl\u00fck depolama s\u00fcresince natamisin ilavesinin, farkl\u0131 asitliklerin ve depolama s\u00fcresinin torba yo\u011furtlar\u0131n\u0131n raf \u00f6mr\u00fc \u00fczerine etkisi ara\u015ft\u0131r\u0131lm\u0131\u015ft\u0131r.

The InYO3 photocatalyst characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, surface area and porosimetry. Energy band structures and density of states were achieved using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy package (CASTEP). The results indicated that the photodegradation of molasses fermentation wastewater was significantly enhanced in the presence of InYO3 when compared with PbWO4. The calcination temperature was found to have a significant effect on the photocatalytic activity of InYO3. Specifically, InYO3 calcined at 700 degrees C had a considerably larger surface area and lower reflectance intensity and showed higher photocatalytic activity. The mathematical simulation results indicated that InYO3 is a direct band gap semiconductor, and its conduction band is composed of In 5p and Y 4d orbitals, whereas its valence band is composed of O 2p and In 5s orbitals.\n[The use of Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 and Andersen testing for fitness and maximal heart rate assessments of 6- to 10-year-old school children](http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/242038493) [DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nBendiksen, Mads; Ahler, Thomas; Clausen, Helle\n2013-01-01\nABSTRACT: We evaluated a sub-maximal and maximal version of the Yo-Yo IR1 childrens test (YYIR1C) and the Andersen test for fitness and maximal HR assessments of children aged 6-10.

Players were divided into three age groups (U15, U17 and U19 and completed three YYIR1 in three consecutive weeks. Pairwise comparisons were used to investigate test reliability (for distances and heart rate responses using technical error (TE, coefficient of variation (CV, intra-class correlation (ICC and limits of agreement (LOA with Bland-Altman plots. The mean YYIR1 distances for the U15, U17 and U19 groups were 2024 \u00b1 470 m, 2404 \u00b1 347 m and 2547 \u00b1 337 m, respectively. The results revealed that the TEs varied between 74 and 172 m, CVs between 3.0 and 7.5%, and ICCs between 0.87 and 0.95 across all age groups for the YYIR1 distance. For heart rate responses, the TEs varied between 1 and 6 bpm, CVs between 0.7 and 4.8%, and ICCs between 0.73 and 0.97. The small ratio LOA revealed that any two YYIR1 performances in one week will not differ by more than 9 to 28% due to measurement error. In summary, the YYIR1 performance and the physiological responses have proven to be highly reliable in a sample of Belgian high-level youth soccer players, aged between 13 and 18 years. The demonstrated high level of intermittent endurance capacity in all age groups may be used for comparison of other prospective young soccer players.\n[Sebze P\u00fcresi ile \u00dcretilen Yo\u011furtlar\u0131n Tekst\u00fcrel ve Duyusal \u00d6zelliklerinin Belirlenmesi](http://www.agrifoodscience.com/index.php/TURJAF/article/view/719) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nT\u00fclay \u00d6zcan\n2016-07-01\nFull Text Available Bu \u00e7al\u0131\u015fmada kontrol (K; balkaba\u011f\u0131 (YBK, havu\u00e7 (YHA, bezelye (YBE ve ye\u015fil kabak p\u00fcreli (YYK yo\u011furt olmak \u00fczere 5 farkl\u0131 set tipi yo\u011furt \u00fcretilmi\u015ftir.

Twenty-two healthy males subjects participated in this study divided into two groups: An experimental group (EG: n = 11) who consumed the antioxidant supplement and a control group (CG: n = 11). All participants performed two test sessions at 07:00 hr before and after 2 weeks of supplementation with Opuntia ficus-indica juice. Blood samples were taken before (P1) and immediately (P2) after the YYIRT. Our results showed that following the 2,2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH \u25cf ) test, the Opuntia ficus-indica juice has an antioxidant capacity for capturing free radicals ( p Opuntia ficus-indica juice before and immediately after YYIRT. However, no significant effect on HDL ( p > .05), GLC ( p > .05) levels nor the SBP and DBP ( p > .05) was observed after supplementation with Opuntia ficus-indica juice. The supplementation leads to an improvement on YYIRT performance (The total distance covered during the YYIRT, V O 2max , VMA) and the rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Opuntia ficus-indica juice has a potent antioxidant activity that reduces total and LDL-cholesterol with only a moderate lowering of HDL-cholesterol and oxidative stress.

We found no evidence that cash payments financed illicit or high-risk behavior. At 6 months, compared with controls, intervention participants had a lower odds of hanging out on the street frequently (odds ratio [OR], .54; p = .10) and a lower odds of reporting that their close friends had been incarcerated (OR, .6; p = .12). They reported less regular alcohol use (OR, .54; p = .04) and a lower odds of having sex (OR, .50; p = .04). The feasibility evaluation of Yo Puedo demonstrated its promise; a larger evaluation of effects on pregnancy and sustained behavioral changes is warranted.

The Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 2 (YYIRT2) can measure this capacity, but there is limited information regarding this assessment in collegiate female soccer players. This study investigated the YYIRT2 as a measure of high-intensity running in this population, and its relationship to other soccer field tests. Twenty-one players from a Division I team were recruited. In addition to the YYIRT2, subjects completed linear (0-5, 0-10, and 0-30 m sprint intervals) and change-of-direction (pro-agility and 60-yard shuttle) speed tests, as well as the YYIRT Level 1 (YYIRT1), to assess relationships with YYIRT2 by correlations (p \u2264 0.05). The correlation of YYIRT1 with the speed tests was also assessed. The YYIRT1 and YYIRT2 were standardized using z-scores for comparison with elite benchmarks to investigate relative performance on each test. The YYIRT2 and YYIRT1 distances did not significantly correlate with those of the speed tests (r = -0.251 to 0.274). There was a large relationship between YYIRT2 and YYIRT1 distances (r = 0.582), although the explained variance was low (33.87%). Mean YYIRT2 z-scores (-4.29 \u00b1 1.66) indicated a performance further from elite benchmarks than those of the YYIRT1 (-1.92 \u00b1 1.61), and 90.5% (19 of 21) subjects performed relatively better in the YYIRT1 than YYIRT2. The YYIRT2 provided a more specific measure of high-intensity running to that of the YYIRT1 in collegiate female soccer players. Coaches may consider using the YYIRT2 to gauge and track progress of high-intensity running capabilities and create training programs to improve this ability in female players.\n[Enfermedad preexistente, agravamiento y/o accidente de trabajo: an\u00e1lisis de 10 casos cl\u00ednicos](http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0465-546X2014000500038&lng=en&tlng=en) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nAna M.\u00aa Gonz\u00e1lez Onetti\n2014-01-01\nFull Text Available En nuestro centro asistencial se han atendido en el a\u00f1o 2012, 1.304 primeras asistencias, de las cuales 85 fueron consideradas no accidente de trabajo/enfermedad profesional.

In this work, we have investigated the electrical and thermal transport properties of Bi{sub 2}YO{sub 4}Cu{sub 2}Se{sub 2} system in the temperature range from 300 K to 873 K. We found that the total thermal conductivity decreases from ~1.8 W m{sup \u22121} K{sup \u22121} to ~0.9 W m{sup \u22121} K{sup \u22121}, and the electrical conductivity decreases from ~850 S/cm to ~163 S/cm in the measured temperature range. To investigate how potential of Bi{sub 2}YO{sub 4}Cu{sub 2}Se{sub 2} system, we prepared the heavily Iodine doped samples to counter-dope intrinsically high carrier concentration and improve the electrical transport properties. Interestingly, the Seebeck coefficient could be enhanced to ~+80 \u03bcV/K at 873 K, meanwhile, we found that a low thermal conductivity of ~0.7 W m{sup \u22121} K{sup \u22121} could be achieved. The intrinsically low thermal conductivity in this system is related to the low elastic properties, such as Young's modulus of 70\u201372 GPa, and Gr\u00fcneisen parameters of 1.55\u20131.71. The low thermal conductivity makes Bi{sub 2}YO{sub 4}Cu{sub 2}Se{sub 2} system to be a potential thermoelectric material, the ZT value ~0.06 at 873 K was obtained, a higher performance is expected by optimizing electrical transport properties through selecting suitable dopants, modifying band structures or by further reducing thermal conductivity through nanostructuring etc. - Highlights: \u2022 The total thermal conductivity decreases from 1.8 to 0.9 Wm{sup \u20131}K{sup \u20131} at 300\u2013873K. \u2022 The electrical conductivity decreased from 850 to 163 S/cm at 300\u2013873K. \u2022 The Seebeck coefficients were enhanced through heavily Iodine doping. \u2022 The ZT ~0.06 at 873K suggests that Bi{sub 2}YO{sub 4}Cu{sub 2}Se{sub 2} systems are potential thermoelectrical materials.\n[\u00bfEDUCADORES O CONSUMIDORES?

El art\u00edculo defiende, en primer lugar, que lo que Emerson propone es una comprensi\u00f3n del yo y de la sociedad que impide cualquier tipo de contraposici\u00f3n entre los dos conceptos de \u00abauto-suficiencia\u00bb. En segundo lugar, se realiza una lectura detenida de su ensayo tard\u00edo \u00abExperiencia\u00bb donde presenta su cr\u00edtica sobre la particular concepci\u00f3n occidental del pensamiento que tiende considerar a este con arreglo a sus consecuencias pol\u00edticas. Si existe alguna esperanza para el yo individual, entonces, para Emerson, debe existir siempre la esperanza tambi\u00e9n de una sociedad democr\u00e1tica. Con ello, intenta recordarnos que el requisito para una sociedad democr\u00e1tica consiste en tomarse en serio la subjetividad de la mirada de cada uno de sus miembros.

The purpose of this paper is to showcase the innovative approaches and methods to cancer prevention and early detection of the YMC program, and to promote it as an effective tool for improving outcomes in community health education, outreach, and engagement activities with Hispanic populations. Key components of the program include educational workshops, mammogram referrals, and a multimedia campaign. The YMC program is unique because of its approaches in reaching the Hispanic population, such as delivering the program with compassionate services to empower participants to live a healthier lifestyle. Additionally, direct follow-up for mammography screenings is provided by program staff. From 2011 to 2013, YMC has educated 2,226 women and 165 men through 93 workshops. About 684 (52 %) women ages 40 and older have had a screening mammogram within their first year of participating in the program. The YMC program is an innovative cancer education and outreach program that has demonstrated a positive impact on the lives of the Hispanic community in the Tampa Bay region.\n[An investigation on photoluminescence and energy transfer of Eu{sup 3+}/Sm{sup 3+} single-doped and co-doped Ca{sub 4}YO(BO{sub 3}){sub 3} phosphors](http://www.etde.org/etdeweb/details.jsp?query_id=1&page=0&osti_id=22287345) [Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)](https://www.etde.org/etdeweb/fieldedsearch.jsp)\nBandi, Vengala Rao; Grandhe, Bhaskar Kumar [Department of Physics, Changwon National University, Changwon 641-773 (Korea, Republic of); Jang, Kiwan, E-mail: kwjang@changwon.ac.kr [Department of Physics, Changwon National University, Changwon 641-773 (Korea, Republic of); Shin, Dong-Soo [Department of Chemistry, Changwon National University, Changwon (Korea, Republic of); Yi, Soung-Soo [Department of Photonics, Silla University, Busan (Korea, Republic of); Jeong, Jung-Hyun [Department of Physics, Pukyong National University, Busan (Korea, Republic of)\n2013-07-15\nThe present investigation aims to demonstrate the potentiality of Eu{sup 3+}/Sm{sup 3+} single-doped and co-doped Ca{sub 4}YO(BO{sub 3}){sub 3} phosphors, which were prepared by a sol\u2013gel method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles showed that all the observed peaks could be attributed to the monoclinic phase of Ca{sub 4}YO(BO{sub 3}){sub 3}. From the measured emission profiles, we have noticed that both the single-doped Eu{sup 3+}/Sm{sup 3+} phosphors shows four emission transitions of {sup 5}D{sub 0} \u2192 {sup 7}F{sub 0,1,2,3} and {sup 4}G{sub 5/2} \u2192 {sup 6}H{sub 5/2,7/2,9/2,11/2} respectively. Among them, the {sup 5}D{sub 0} \u2192 {sup 7}F{sub 2} of Eu{sup 3+} and {sup 4}G{sub 5/2} \u2192 {sup 6}H{sub 7/2} of Sm{sup 3+} are intense emission transitions, leading to an intense red color emission from the prepared phosphors. The excitation spectra showed that Eu{sup 3+}/Sm{sup 3+} doped samples can be excited efficiently by 394 nm and 402 nm respectively, incidentally which matches well with the characteristic emission from UVLED. The co-doping of Sm{sup 3+} ions can broaden and strengthen the absorption of near UV region and to be efficient to sensitize the emission of the Ca{sub 4}YO(BO{sub 3}){sub 3}:Eu{sup 3+} phosphor. The mechanism involved in the energy transfer between Eu{sup 3+} and Sm{sup 3+} has been explained and elucidated by an energy level diagram. - Highlights: \u2022 Eu{sup 3+} or/and Sm{sup 3+}:Ca{sub 4}YO(BO{sub 3}){sub 3} phosphors were prepared by sol\u2013gel method. \u2022 The co-doping of Sm{sup 3+} to Ca{sub 4}YO(BO{sub 3}){sub 3}:Eu{sup 3+} extends its absorption of NUV region. \u2022 It has intense absorption in NUV region, which is suitable for NUV LED. \u2022 The energy transfer process between Eu{sup 3+} and Sm{sup 3+} ions were discussed.\n[\u00abNovela sin mundo\u00bb y otras t\u00e9cnicas para el desvanecimiento del yo en Macedonio Fern\u00e1ndez](http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=451554632012) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nSelnich Vivas Hurtado\n2017-01-01\nFull Text Available A trav\u00e9s de Museo de la novela de la Eterna y los conceptos de \u00abBelarte\u00bb y \u00abHumorismo\u00bb, Macedonio Fern\u00e1ndez se propone ha - cer una novela experimental en donde sea posible la duda y el des - vanecimiento del yo.

Correa\n2017-10-01\nFull Text Available This article is a reflection on the application of the Cuban literacy methodology Yo, S\u00ed Puedo to the Australian setting. The Yo, S\u00ed Puedo / Yes, I Can! model developed in Cuba by the Instituto Pedag\u00f3gico Latinoamericano y Caribe\u00f1o, IPLAC (Institute of Pedagogy for Latin America and the Caribbean has been successfully implemented across the Global South as a strategy of adult literacy. It is a legacy of our Latin American revolutionary roots, with its origin in the Freirean pedagogy of the oppressed. Expanding across continents this model continues to teach reading and writing to disenfranchised adults in marginal and Indigenous communities, from the Argentinean Chaco to Brewarrina in northern NSW, Australia. Its aim is to contribute to the hope of improving the health and educational outcomes of the country\u2019s First Peoples. This article is indebted to conversations with the Cuban advisor of Yes, I Can!, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Chala Leblanch. Observing him working in the classroom setting of Brewarrina touched me at different levels: personally because it reminded me of my own family experiences with the education system in my country, Argentina; and professionally as an educator negotiating different languages and cultures. It also reinforced my belief in the importance of incorporating Indigenous ways of learning and teaching to Western styles of teaching and learning. I built this reflection moving from personal and poetic\u2014visual and textual\u2014narratives and observations to academic interventions informed by researched literature on adult and Indigenous education.\n[El yo como l\u00edmite al modelo perceptivo de conocimiento](http://www.e-revistes.uji.es/index.php/recerca/article/view/1931) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nRicardo Guti\u00e9rrez Aguilar\n2016-01-01\nFull Text Available En este art\u00edculo se trata de presentar una panor\u00e1mica general del problema del conocimiento cuando es aplicado a la tem\u00e1tica del yo.

The YO band head at 584.27 nm belonging to A 2 \u03a0 - X 2 \u03a3 + system is used for LEI signal detection. It is also shown that the LEI signal is enhanced when the mixture of air - acetylene - argon (AAA) is used instead of commonly used air-acetylene (AA) mixture. In the present work an XeCl laser (308 nm) pumped rhodamine 6G dye laser, covering a range of 570-610 nm is used. The sample/standard in solution form is aspirated into the flame with pneumatic nebulizer. The working curve is a straight line showing linear dependence of LEI signal with yttrium concentration.

K.; Meyer, Tim\n2017-01-01\nBackground Female soccer has grown extensively in recent years, however differences in gender-specific physiology have rarely been considered. The female reproductive hormones which rise and fall throughout the menstrual cycle, are known to affect numerous cardiovascular, respiratory, thermoregulatory and metabolic parameters, which in turn, may have implications on exercise physiology and soccer performance. Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to investigate potential effects of menstrual cycle phase on performance in soccer specific tests. Methods Nine sub elite female soccer players, all of whom have menstrual cycles of physiological length; performed a series of physical performance tests (Yo-Yo Intermittent endurance test (Yo-Yo IET), counter movement jump (CMJ) and 3x30 m sprints). These were conducted at distinct time points during two main phases of the menstrual cycle (early follicular phase (FP) and mid luteal phase (LP)) where hormones contrasted at their greatest magnitude. Results Yo-Yo IET performance was considerably lower during the mid LP (2833\u00b1896 m) as compared to the early FP (3288\u00b1800 m). A trend towards significance was observed (p = 0.07) and the magnitude based inferences suggested probabilities of 0/61/39 for superiority/equality/inferiority of performance during the mid LP, leading to the inference of a possibly harmful effect. For CMJ (early FP, 20.0\u00b13.9 cm; mid LP 29.6\u00b13.0 cm, p = 0.33) and sprint (early FP, 4.7\u00b10.1 s; mid LP, 4.7\u00b10.1 s, p = 0.96) performances the results were unclear (8/24/68, 48/0/52, respectively). Conclusion The results of this study are in support of a reduction in maximal endurance performance during the mid LP of the menstrual cycle. However, the same effect was not observed for jumping and sprint performance. Therefore, consideration of cycle phase when monitoring a player\u2019s endurance capacity may be worthwhile.

Although recently the interest arises to analyze how emotions boost social mobilizations. The objective of this work is analyze the emotions arising in the context of the collective action which was taken by young Mexicans in the movement #Yo Soy 132 through social constructionism of emotions as the theoretical perspective and using as method the discourse analysis. This paper is presented in five parts: in the first the emotions in the collective action are discussed, subsequently the studied phenomenon is contextualized, in the third the analysis method is detailed, in the fourth, results are presented, and in the last section, the findings are confronted on the basis of theoretical approaches recovered. It is concluded that regardless of the context, emotions keep on a similar path in collective action, and the emerged emotions are not positive or negative, instead they are impulsor and detractor of such action.\n[Comunidades est\u00e9ticas e ingenier\u00eda en comunicac\u00edon social.

For determination of shield material, thicknesses, weight, installation and maintenance costs as well as radiation attenuation properties are taken into consideration such factors. Effective radiation for shielding is neutrons in proton accelerators and shield design is made for neutrons. Concrete, soil and iron are widely used as a shield material. In this paper, the different density of the shielding materials (soil, standard concrete, iron were selected to determine for the minimum thickness of the side wall for shielding design of proton accelerator. The thickness of the shielding is obtained by a simulation with the Monte Carlo Code FLUKA.

School of Medicine\n2003-01-01\nImaging of dopaminergic function is useful in the investigation of patients with Parkinson disease (iPD) and other extrapyramidal diseases. Using agents that bind to dopamine transporters ([{sup 123}I]{beta}-CIT) and receptors ([{sup 123}I]IBF SPECT), we investigated SPECT in 9 healthy volunteers and 24 patients for dopamine transporters as well as 15 patients for dopamine receptors. In {beta}-CIT SPECT studies, we examined 17 iPD patients (63.3{+-}9.9 y/o), 3 multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients (olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) type) (64.0{+-}8.0 y/o), 2 vascular parkinsonism (VP) patients (71.0{+-}0.0 y/o), 1 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patient (69 y/o), 1 cortico-basal degeneration (CBD) patient (50 y/o) and nine healthy controls (39.1{+-}9.3 y/o). For IBF SPECT studies 11 iPD patients (60.6{+-}10.9 y/o), 3 MSA patients (2 OPCA type (50.5{+-}3.5 y/o) and 1 striatonigral degeneration (SND) type (65 y/o)) and 1 PSP patient (60 y/o) underwent SPECT scans after the injection of [{sup 123}I]IBF. The specific to nonspecific striatal ratio (St/Oc-1), ratio of putaminal uptake to caudatal uptake (Pu/Ca), and asymmetry indices (AI) were estimated. {beta}-CIT studies showed ST/Oc-1 as follows; iPD: 2.66{+-}1.09 (n=17), VP: 5.73 and 7.39, MSA: 1.84{+-}0.46 (n=3), PSP: 2.34, CBD: 2.16. In all extrapyramidal diseases except VP, St/Oc-1 ratios were significantly lower than those in normal volunteers (6.46{+-}1.08) (p<0.01). Also in early-phase iPD patients (Yahr I-II), St/Oc-1 (3.16{+-}1.49: n=4) was significantly lower than those in normal volunteers (p<0.01). In IBF studies, St/Oc-1 ratios were significantly higher in early-phase (Yahr I-II) iPD patients (1.82{+-}0.25: n=5) than those in late-phase (Yahr III-IV) iPD patients (1.38{+-}0.32: n=6) (p<0.05).

Two matches were played at sea-level and three at 3600 m on Days 1, 6 and 13. The Yo-Yo Intermittent recovery test (vYo-YoIR1) was performed at sea-level, and on Days 3 and 10. Match activity profiles were measured via 10-Hz GPS. Distance covered >14.4 km.h(-1) (D>14.4 km\u00b7h(-1)) and >80% of vYo-YoIR1 (D>80%vYo-YoIR1) were examined. Upon arrival at altitude, there was a greater decrement in vYo-YoIR1 (Cohen's d +1.0, 90%CL \u00b1 0.8) and D>14.4 km\u00b7h(-1) (+0.5 \u00b1 0.8) in AUS. D>14.4 km.h(-1) was similarly reduced relative to vYo-YoIR1 in both groups, so that D>80%vYo-YoIR1 remained similarly unchanged (-0.1 \u00b1 0.8). Throughout the altitude sojourn, vYo-YoIR1 and D>14.4 km\u00b7h(-1) increased in parallel in AUS, so that D>80%vYo-YoIR1 remained stable in AUS (+6.0%/match, 90%CL \u00b1 6.7); conversely D>80%vYo-YoIR1 decreased largely in BOL (-12.2%/match \u00b1 6.2). In sea-level natives competing at high-altitude, changes in match running performance likely follow those in high-intensity running performance. Bolivian data confirm that increases in 'fitness' do not necessarily translate into greater match running performance, but rather in reduced relative exercise intensity. Key pointsWhen playing at high-altitude, players may alter their activities during matches in relation to their transient maximal physical capacities, possibly to maintain a 'tolerable' relative exercise intensity.While there is no doubt that running performance per se in not the main determinant of match outcomes (Carling, 2013), fitness levels influence relative match intensity (Buchheit et al., 2012, Mendez-Villanueva et al., 2013), which in-turn may impact on decision making and skill performance (Rampinini et al., 2008).In the context of\n[Cultura, memoria autobiogr\u00e1fica y yo: un an\u00e1lisis narrativo de las dimensiones de autonom\u00eda y relaci\u00f3n](https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=od______3272::38165b1267f106f3090ac085c061fd70)\nMata Ben\u00edtez, Manuel de La; Santamar\u00eda Santigosa, Andr\u00e9s; Cubero P\u00e9rez, Mercedes; Antal\u00edkov\u00e1, Radka\n2015-01-01\nSegundo Encuentro de la Secci\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rica de la ISCAR (International Society for Cultural and Activity Research) celebrado en el Santuario de Santa Mar\u00eda del Collell (Girona) los d\u00edas 21, 22 y 23 de abril de 2014.

En este grupo se destaca el mielomeningocele (MMC) por su mayor incidencia, y por ser la m\u00e1s incapacitante y la m\u00e1s compleja entre todas las dem\u00e1s malformaciones del sistema nervioso c`entral (SNC). En Bolivia, como en muchos pa\u00edses de Sudam\u00e9rica, los bajos niveles socio-culturales y la debilidad en el sistema sanitario, hacen que su incidencia y su morbilidad, sean mayores que en las naciones m\u00e1s desarrolladas. Material y M\u00e9todos: Se realiz\u00f3 un estudio retrospectivo y descriptivo de 70 casos de MMC, atendidos por un equipo multidisciplinario en el Hospital Universitario Japon\u00e9s (HUJ) de Santa Cruz de la Sierra, entre 2008-2011.

Paying attention to what constitutes the reality enables a sort of asceticism of the experience, that leads beyond the deliriums of an I absorbed. The exercise of estimating the details, the connections, the complexity, modifies the decision itself: it does not be a matter of electing, but of \u201cseeing\u201d the moral thing -the demand of the thing-, the same as an exact artist does not paint what \u201che likes\u201d but \u201cwhat it is there\u201d.\nMuchos de los dilemas morales perder\u00edan su intensidad, piensa Iris Murdoch, si abandon\u00e1ramos la idea de una voluntad soberana que elige aut\u00f3nomamente sus cursos de acci\u00f3n.

The New York State Planning and Research Cooperative database was used to identify all patients admitted with complicated appendicitis and undergoing appendectomy within 1-year. Primary outcome was any complication. Secondary outcomes included length of stay (LOS), hospital charges, and laparoscopy use. Outcomes were compared in appendectomy before or after 48h from admission. 31,167 patients \u226518yo were identified for analysis, 28,015(89.9%) underwent early appendectomy. Early appendectomy patients were more likely to be White (69.8% vs. 64.2% p < 0.01), and commercially insured (53.1% vs. 45.4%, p < 0.01). Of the 3152 undergoing delayed surgery, 1610(51.1%) had surgery later during the index admission, 715(22.7%) were readmitted urgently and underwent appendectomy, and 827(26.2%) had elective appendectomy. Patients undergoing delayed surgery had more complications (OR 1.34 95%CI 1.23-1.45), readmissions (OR 1.55 95%CI 1.42-1.70), high hospital charges (OR 4.79 95%CI 4.35-5.27), and prolonged LOS (OR 6.12 95%CI 5.61-6.68). In this population-level study of complicated appendicitis we found more complications, longer LOS, and higher charges in patients undergoing delayed surgery. Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In-pile experiments coupled with destructive examinations of breached fuel have consistently revealed noticeable changes in fuel structure accompanying FSRP formation at the fuel surface. Previous analyses have also indicated a significant impact of FSRP on fuel centerline temperature. Successful modeling of breached fuel thermal behavior therefore requires a reasonably accurate knowledge of the thermal properties of the FSRP, especially its thermal conductivity. But laboratory investigations have been scarce and limited to the Na/UO 2 system because of the toxicity of plutonium and hygroscopicity of the FSRP. Hence, post-irradiation observations of fuel samples remain the most amenable way of deriving the thermal conductivity of the FSRP.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses confirmed the purity of all samples. The XRD data shows that the average crystallite size lies between 60.95 nm and 50.10 nm and same was confirmed by Transmission electron microscopy. Transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy analyses presented the hexagonal morphology of all products. The characteristic hysteresis (\u03c3-H) curves proved the ferromagnetic feature of as grown nanoparticle samples. Specific saturation magnetization (\u03c3s) drops from 46.59 to 34.89 emu/g with increasing Cr content while the coercive field values lie between 770 and 1652 Oe. The large magnitude of the magnetocrystalline (intrinsic) anisotropy field, (Ha) between 11.0 and 12.6 kOe proves that all products are magnetically hard. The energy band gap values decrease from 2.0 eV to 1.84 eV with increasing Cr content.

En este marco, es relevante revisar los sentidos que asume el juego de intertextualidad con la tragedia griega que propone el discurso del poemario. Ello se relaciona, por una parte, con la necesidad de confrontar un presente que se avizora complejo y confuso desde una tradici\u00f3n cultural que aporta construcciones ideol\u00f3gicas y sensibilidades comunitarias que pueden confrontarse con el propio contexto. Por otro lado, el juego intertextual posibilita dar sustento y legitimidad a una voz l\u00edrica que no solo expone la furia de ciertos padecimientos, sino que procura, dificultosamente, encontrar modos para que ese malestar se canalice de modo productivo.This article aims to analyze La Hybris (2009, a poetry book by the Argentine writer Alicia Genovese, considering the configuration of the lyric subject as well as the gender politics developed in the text. In this frame, it is relevant to observe the role of intertextuality, in particular, the dialogue established between the tradition of classic tragedles and the poems' discourses. The hypotesis ofthis work mantains that, referring to Greek tragedy, the poems may confront a present that is perceived both complex and confused. On the other hand, intertextuality functions as a way to give support and legitimacy to a lyric voice that not only aims to expose the fury caused by pain but also aspires to canalize her feelings productively.\n[\u00ab\u00bfQui\u00e9n soy yo? \u00bfQui\u00e9nes son ellos/as?\u00bb.

TGA analysis showed ~35% weight loss. The crystallite size determined by XRD and SEM ranged from 30 to 80 nm and ~30 to 50 nm, respectively. The dielectric behavior was evaluated in the range of 1.0\u00d7106 Hz to 3.0\u00d710 9 Hz at 298 K, the dielectric parameters resulting appreciably enhanced by co-doping with Sr and Fe.

Here, we present results on composition-microstructure-electrical property relationships for polycrystalline BST films produced by magnetron-sputter deposition, that are appropriate for microwave and millimeter-wave applications such as varactors and frequency triplers. Films with controlled compositions were grown from a stoichiometric Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 target by control of the background processing gas pressure. It was determined that the (Ba+Sr)/Ti ratios of these BST films could be adjusted from 0.73 to 0.98 by changing the total (Ar+O2) process pressure, while the O2/Ar ratio did not strongly affect the metal ion composition. Film crystalline structure and dielectric properties as a function of the (Ba+Sr)/Ti ratio are discussed. Optimized BST films yielded capacitors with low dielectric losses (0.0047), among the best reported for sputtered BST, while still maintaining tunabilities suitable for device applications.\n[Ejecuci\u00f3n del programa de alfabetizaci\u00f3n \u201cYo s\u00ed Puedo\u201d en Cusubamba-Salcedo](https://enfermeriainvestiga.uta.edu.ec/index.php/enfermeria/article/view/98) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nMiguel Angel De la Fuente Briz\n2017-12-01\nFull Text Available El analfabetismo es un problema que impide el desarrollo social y econ\u00f3mico de las personas, afectando la calidad de vida y la salud.

Here, we have examined the age- and location-specific seroprevalence of antibodies against FLUCV in 1441 sera from metropolitan continental France (Marseille), South-West Indian Ocean French territories (Reunion Island) and United-Kingdom (Edinburgh) using a combination of haemagglutination inhibition, virus neutralisation and ELISA assays. Our results show that immunity to FLUCV is common in all locations studied (global seroprevalence values >50%) and that the first immunising contacts generally occur early in life (i.e., in the 0-4 year-old age group). The latter item is further supported by the detection of FLUCV RNA by RT-PCR in naso-pharyngeal samples collected in patient attending the Emergency Room of the Public hospitals of Marseille, France with a large majority of children under 10 years-old: 17 (60.7%) in children \u22643 yo, 10 (35.7%) in the 4-10 yo age group and 1 (3.6%) in an adult (49yo). The temporal distribution of cases was atypical with regard to influenza (a large proportion of cases occurred in spring and summer) and the clinical presentation was diverse, including but being not limited to classical Influenza-like-Ilnesses. Altogether, our results indicate an intense circulation of FLUCV in the different study areas and an early occurrence of infection in human life. Flu C appears to be a widely under-diagnosed and under-studied human paediatric disease that obviously deserves further clinical and epidemiological characterisation.

Nineteen children (less than 1 y/o: 12, 1 y/o: 2, 2 y/o: 3, and 4 y/o: 2) were studied by CT imaging and bronchofiberscopy in addition to gastric Mycobacterium tuberculosis examination and regular chest XP. In 13 of total 19 patients (68%), lobar or segmental epituberculosis occured after starting antituberculous chemotherapy, including a case in which epituberculosis of right upper lobe was recognized at the time of diagnosis of tuberculosis and after starting chemotherapy, epituberculosis of right middle lobe was observed. CT imaging revealed that all 19 patients had enlargement of mediastinal and/or hilar lymphonodes compressing neighboring bronchi, and 16 of total 19 patients (84%) demonstrated relevant parenchymal infiltration. Gastric Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive in 15 out of 19 patients (79%). Bronchofiberscopy was done in 16 patients, and it demonstrated mass lesion of various size on the bronchial wall in 13 patients (81%). The present study demonstrated that epituberculosis predominantly occured in tuberculosis infants less than one year old, which was different from the previous reports. The CT imaging also makes clear that epituberculosis may be the atelectasis of lobe or segment which occurs mostly due to compression of bronchi by the enlargement of mediastinal and/or hilar lymphonodes and their early exacerbation after starting chemotherapy. Bronchofiberscopy also elucidated that bronchial wall mass lesion resulted from perforation of lynphonodes may partially contribute to the formation of epituberculosis.

Many of these advantages revolve around the environmental impact and particularly energy efficiency. However, progress in the field of these devices operating at high temperatures require the continuous search for new materials with advanced properties, optimization in manufacturing, cutting edge technologies for the processing of its main components (anode-electrolyte-cathode-seal) and low manufacturing costs. Here, the perovskite structure material LaxSr1-xCryMn1-yO3-\u03b4 (LSCM) is efficient, stable redox environments, has low manufacturing cost and is optimized for SOFC applications. Its properties compare favorably with the compound Ni/YSZ using hydrogen as a fuel; and when methane is used, it requires only 3% moisture to prevent carbon formation, which is much lower compared to when used Ni/YSZ (50% moisture). The LSCM material allows a SOFC cell operate at intermediate temperatures around 700\u00b0C. This article provides a brief review of the excellent properties and potential presented by this perovskite.

We developed Yo Puedo, a combined conditional cash transfer and life skills intervention for youth to promote educational attainment, job training, and reproductive health wellness that we then evaluated for feasibility among 162 youth aged 16-21 years in a predominantly Latino community in San Francisco, CA. The intervention targeted youth's social networks and involved recruitment and randomization of small social network clusters. In this paper we describe the design of the feasibility study and report participants' baseline characteristics. Furthermore, we examined the sample and design implications of recruiting social network clusters as the unit of randomization. Baseline data provide evidence that we successfully enrolled high risk youth using a social network recruitment approach in community and school-based settings. Nearly all participants (95%) were high risk for adverse educational and reproductive health outcomes based on multiple measures of low socioeconomic status (81%) and/or reported high risk behaviors (e.g., gang affiliation, past pregnancy, recent unprotected sex, frequent substance use; 62%). We achieved variability in the study sample through heterogeneity in recruitment of the index participants, whereas the individuals within the small social networks of close friends demonstrated substantial homogeneity across sociodemographic and risk profile characteristics. Social networks recruitment was feasible and yielded a sample of high risk youth willing to enroll in a randomized study to evaluate a novel sexual health intervention.\n[Tratamiento con inmunoterapia espec\u00edfica en ni\u00f1os con Rinitis Al\u00e9rgica y/o Asma Bronquial. \u00c1rea Norte. 2005 - 2007.](http://infociencia.idict.cu/index.php/infociencia/article/view/293) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nMatilde Iraida Morera Franco\n2007-10-01\nFull Text Available Se realiz\u00f3 un estudio descriptivo longitudinal durante el per\u00edodo Enero 2005_ Enero 2007 en el Policl\u00ednico Norte del municipio Sancti Sp\u00edritus.

Post-traumatic arthritis occurred in 23 ankles (59%) but only 4 ankles of grade 4 arthrosis resulted in poor functional scale and the overall satisfactory rate was 82%. It was found that anatomic reduction, rigid fixation and early motion exercise are important to successful treatment of ankle fractures. Regarding pilon fracture, specifically the severity of fracture pattern and delay of reduction are important problems to overcome to ensure successful results. Therefore, adequate surgical approach for entire view of ankle joint, reduction and fixation of fibula, sufficient bone graft for articular support, intraoperative x-ray check and postoperative immobilization are essential for the achievement of better clinical results.\n[Se\u00e7ici \u00d6zellikteki Farkl\u0131 Besiyerlerinin baz\u0131 Mayalar\u0131n Meyveli Yo\u011furttan Geri Kazan\u0131mlar\u0131 Amac\u0131 ile Kar\u015f\u0131la\u015ft\u0131r\u0131lmalar\u0131 (\u0130ngilizce)](https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=doajarticles::d3f87ac538f7efb0426e53a5a9a33827)\n\u015eule \u015eenses Erg\u00fcl; Z.

Leiter\n2016-07-01\nFull Text Available Background: Ice hockey is a fast, physical sport that requires high levels of muscular strength, muscular endurance and agility. Objectives: This study was conducted to create a profile including: anthropometric measurement, muscular strength, muscular endurance, lower body jump height and distance, and agility characteristics for elite youth hockey players. Methods: Pre-season off-ice testing results were retrospectively reviewed from a human performance database. Variables included height, weight, body fat percentage, grip strength, push-ups/bench press, supine rows, the plank test, vertical jump, standing long jump, hip adductor and abductor strength, and the 5-10-5 shuttle, and. One-way ANOVAs (1group x 4 time and Tukeys post-hoc tests were performed to determine changes in the immediately successive age group (p<0.05. Results: Participants included male Bantam-(age: 13-14 and Midget-(age: 15-17 AAA ice-hockey players (n=260. Age categories were grouped as 13 years old (yo(n=75, 14 yo (n=70, 15 yo (n=58, and 16-17 yo (n=57. Increases between successive age groups were observed in the following variables: weight (13, 14, 15 and 16-17 yo, height (13 and 14 yo, left and right grip strength (13, 14, 15, and 16-17 yo, bench press (15 and 16-17 yo, left and right hip abduction (14, 15, and 16-17 yo, and vertical and standing long jump (13, 14, and 15 yo. Total time for the 5-10-5 shuttle run test decreased from 13 to 14yo, and 14 to 15 yo. Conclusion: Changes with age in off-ice performance variables of elite amateur hockey players should be recognized, followed, and addressed during player development to maximize the potential for elite performance and reduce the risk of injury.

Twenty junior male soccer players completed the Yo-Yo, the RSA, and the Wingate tests on three different occasions: one-week before Ramadan (BR), the second week (SWR) and the fourth week (ER) of Ramadan. The total distance (TD) covered and the estimated maximal aerobic velocity (MAV) during the Yo-Yo test were recorded. During the RSA test, peak power (PP) during each sprint, the percentage of decrement of PP (PD) and total work (Wtotal) were calculated. During the Wingate test, peak (P(peak)) and mean (P(mean)) powers and fatigue index (FI) were recorded. TD and MAV (P=0.01) during the Yo-Yo test and PP (P=0.01, P=0.004, P=0.001, P=0.01, P=0.03 for sprints 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively) and Wtotal (P=0.02) during the RSA test were significantly higher during BR than ER. Furthermore, muscle fatigue during the RSA test increased significantly from BR to ER (P=0.01). P(peak) and P(mean) during the Wingate test decreased significantly from BR to SWR and ER (PRamadan in comparison with BR. The present study suggests that both aerobic and anaerobic performances during the Yo-Yo, the RSA and the Wingate tests were affected by Ramadan fasting in young soccer players.\n[The correlation between heart rate variability and improvement in soccer player\u2019s physical performance. http://dx.doi.org/10.5007/1980-0037.2012v14n6p713](http://www.periodicos.ufsc.br/index.php/rbcdh/article/view/1980-0037.2012v14n6p713/23098) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nRicardo Santos Oliveira\n2012-11-01\nFull Text Available The aim of this study was to analyze whether the heart rate variability (HRV, assessed at the beginning of a soccer preseason, reveals a correlation with the improvement of physical performance over this training period. Ten soccer players took part in the study. Their performance was evaluated by the following tests: the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test, Level 1(Yo-Yo IR1; the 30-m sprint time, and the vertical jump; all were conducted before and after six weeks of pre-season. The HRV measurements were performed at rest in the supine position for ten minutes. The Spearman Rank Correlation test was used to investigate any possible relationship between HRV and improvements in performance, while the Student\u2019s t-test verified the changes in both performance and HRV. The Magnitude-Based Inferences approach (qualitative analysis was applied to verify the possibilities of the observed values being positive, negative or inconclusive. There were significant improvements in Yo-Yo IR1 performance (P< 0.001 and in the 30-m sprint time (P< 0.001. The qualitative analysis revealed that the differences in Yo-Yo IR1 performance were very likely positive, were almost certainly positive for the sprint, but were inconclusive for the vertical jump. There was a strong correlation between one parasympathetic index and the change in performance [r = 0.85 P = 0.003 (IC95% = 0.49 \u2013 0.97]. In conclusion, this study revealed a strong correlation between parasympathetic indices of HRV (analyzed before the training with the performance improvement in Yo-Yo IR1 in football athletes during pre-season.\n[Repeated sprint ability in young basketball players: multi-direction vs. one-change of direction (Part 1](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fphys.2016.00133/full) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nJohnny ePadulo\n2016-04-01\nFull Text Available The aim of the present study was to examine the reliability of a novel multi-direction repeated sprint ability test (RSM; 10\u00d7(6\u00d75-m compared with a repeated sprint ability test (RSA with one change of direction (10\u00d7(2\u00d715-m, and the relationship of the RSM and RSA with Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1 and jump performances [squat jump (SJ and counter-movement-jump (CMJ].

They were randomized into a high-intensity training (HIT; n = 13) group and a control (CON; n = 12) group. In addition to the normal team training and games, HIT performed 6-10 \u00d7 30-seconds all-out running intervals separated by 3-minute recovery periods 3 times per week during a 4-week in-season period whereas CON only completed the team training sessions and games. Preintervention and postintervention, all players completed the arrowhead agility test (AAT), a repeated sprint test (RST; 5 \u00d7 30 meters separated by 25 seconds of recovery), and the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery level 2 test (Yo-Yo IR2) followed by a-10 minute rest period and the Yo-Yo IR1 test. Mean running distance during HIT in week 1 was 152 \u00b1 4 m and increased (p \u2264 0.05) by 4.6% (159 \u00b1 3 m) in week 4. The AAT performance improved (p \u2264 0.05) by 2.3% (18.87 \u00b1 0.97-18.44 \u00b1 1.06 seconds) and RST by 4.3% postintervention in the HIT group only. Baseline RST fatigue index was 7.0 \u00b1 2.9 and 6.2 \u00b1 5.0% in HIT and CON, respectively, but was lowered (p \u2264 0.05) to 2.7 \u00b1 3.0% posttraining in HIT and remained unaltered in CON (5.5 \u00b1 5.0%). In HIT, Yo-Yo IR2 and Yo-Yo IR1 performance improved by 12.6 and 18.3% postintervention, respectively, with greater (p \u2264 0.05) Yo-yo IR1 change scores than in CON. In conclusion, additional high-intensity in-season training performed as interval running improved agility, repeated sprint ability, and high-intensity intermittent exercise performance in elite women volleyball players.\n[Different Training Loads Partially Influence Physiological Responses to the Preparation Period in Basketball.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28146032)\nFerioli, Davide; Bosio, Andrea; La Torre, Antonio; Carlomagno, Domenico; Connolly, Darragh R; Rampinini, Ermanno\n2018-03-01\nFerioli, D, Bosio, A, La Torre, A, Carlomagno, D, Connolly, DR, and Rampinini, E. Different training loads partially influence physiological responses to preparation period in basketball. J Strength Cond Res 32(3): 790-797, 2018-The aim of this study was to compare the session rating of perceived exertion training load (sRPE-TL), training volume (TV), and the changes in physical fitness between professional (n = 14) and semiprofessional (n = 18) basketball players during the preparation period. Furthermore, relationships between sRPE-TL and TV with changes in physical fitness level were investigated. The players performed the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test-level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) before and after the preparation period. In addition, physiological responses to a standardized 6-minute continuous running test (Mognoni's test) and to a standardized 5-minute high-intensity intermittent running test (HIT) were measured. Session rating of perceived exertion-TL and TV were greater for professional (5,241 \u00b1 1787 AU; 914 \u00b1 122 minutes) compared with semiprofessional players (2,408 \u00b1 487 AU; 583 \u00b1 65 minutes). Despite these differences, Yo-Yo IR1 performance improvements (\u223c30%) and physiological adaptations to the Mognoni's test were similar between the 2 groups. Furthermore, physiological adaptations to HIT were slightly greater for professional compared with semiprofessional players; however, the magnitude of these effects was only small/moderate. No clear relationships were found between sRPE-TL and changes in Yo-Yo IR1 performance and Mognoni's test (rs \u00b1 90% confidence interval [CI]: Yo-Yo IR1, 0.18 \u00b1 0.30; Mognoni's test, -0.14 \u00b1 0.29).

Methods Wellness and fatigue were assessed using questionnaires and resting heart rate (HR) and HR variability. Physical performance was assessed using HR responses to a submaximal run, a Yo-Yo Intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-YoIR1) and a 20 m sprint. Most measures were performed daily, with the exception of Yo-YoIR1 and 20 m sprints, which were performed near sea level and on days 3 and 10 at altitude. Results Compared with near sea level, Australians had moderate-to-large impairments in wellness and Yo-YoIR1 relative to the Bolivians on arrival at altitude. The acclimatisation of most measures to altitude was substantially slower in Australians than Bolivians, with only Bolivians reaching near sea-level baseline high-intensity running by the end of the camp. Both teams had moderately impaired 20 m sprinting at the end of the camp. Exercise HR had large associations (r>0.5\u20130.7) with changes in Yo-YoIR1 in both groups. Conclusions Despite partial physiological and perceptual acclimatisation, 2 weeks is insufficient for restoration of physical performance in young sea-level native soccer players. Because of the possible decrement in 20 m sprint time, a greater emphasis on speed training may be required during and after altitude training. The specific time course of restoration for each variable suggests that they measure different aspects of acclimatisation to 3600 m; they should therefore be used in combination to assess adaptation to altitude.

After the completion of a competitive season, 29 male soccer players were divided into 3 groups: the running group (n = 13), the plyometric group (n = 11), and the control group (n = 5). Both training groups completed either running or plyometric training sessions 2 d\u00b7wk(-1) for 3 weeks, whereas the control group was not allowed to perform any training. The subjects performed YoYoIR2 and 20-m sprint tests before (pre) and after (post) the experimental period. Neither training group showed any significant training effects on the YoYoIR2 performance or 20-m sprint times compared with the control group. This study suggests that neither endurance running nor plyometric training 2 d\u00b7wk(-1) for 3 weeks has a significant effect on high-intensity performance compared with a nontraining regimen. However, our results do not support complete inactivity. These results may have important implications for the management of training cessation for a few weeks.\n[Comparative Study on the Adaptation and Growth Dynamics of the Helix pomatia and Helix aspersa Muller Terrestrial Snails Under Different Feeding Regimes](http://spasb.ro/index.php/spasb/article/view/743) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nAdrian Toader-Williams\n2010-05-01\nFull Text Available We used Helix pomatia and Helix aspersa species and measure their growth as the snails were approaching the hibernation season. Helix pomatia 2yo shown a decrease in weight while being raised in enclosed parcels of 4sqm the younger Helix pomatia 1yo as well as Helix aspersa Muller demonstrated the ability to adapt relatively fast to the same conditions. We established 5 experimental lots in a Helix pomatia farm, GPS coordinates N46.606040 E23.599950. Control lot contained Taraxacum officinales, Sonchus oleraceus, Equisetum arvense and Atriplex hortensis, wild flora found within the farm. The other lots contained the same plants as the control lot plus different combinations of imported plants from other areals. The H. pomatia 2yo weight decreased in the control lot by a mean of -3.86% while H. aspersa 1yo marked an increase of +16.89% in the same lot during the same period. The lot containing lupinus polyphyllus delivered snails with weight gain of +24.66% for H. pomatia 2yo and an increase of only +1.98% for H. aspersa 1yo. As a contrast, H. pomatia 2yo gained only +7.72% while H. aspersa 1yo gained +28.89%, in the lot containing Lavanda officinalis, Foeniculum vulgare and Hyssopus officinalis among the other plants.\n[USUARIO/A Nombre de usuario/a admin Contrase\u00f1a \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 No cerrar sesi\u00f3n Iniciar sesi\u00f3n CONTENIDO DE LA REVISTA Buscar Buscar Examinar Por n\u00famero Por autor/a Por t\u00edtulo Otras revistas OPEN JOURNAL SYSTEMS Ayuda de la revista INFORMACI\u00d3N Para los lectores/as Para los autores/as Para los bibliotecarios/as TAMA\u00d1O DE FUENTE Make font size smallerMake font size defaultMake font size larger INICIO ACERCA DE INICIAR SESI\u00d3N REGISTRARSE BUSCAR ACTUAL ARCHIVOS Inicio > Vol. 7, n\u00fam. 12 (2014 >\\tBayona \u201cYO SOY DEL SON A LA SALSA\u201d: LA RE-EDICI\u00d3N DE NUEVAS EXPRESIONES INTERCULTURALES CARIBE\u00d1AS EN EL ESPACIO CINEMATOGR\u00c1FICO](http://www.coruniamericana.edu.co/publicaciones/ojs/index.php/pensamientoamericano/article/view/216/204) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nMaydi Estrada Bayona\n2014-05-01\nFull Text Available \u201cYo soy del Son a la Salsa\u201d (I am From Son to Salsa: The reedition of new Caribbean intercultural expressions in the film space, is a reflective article which is part of the research entitled Caribbean Intercultural Keys in the film poetics of Rigoberto L\u00f3pez.

This investigation consisted of two separate studies. Study 1 assessed the soccer-specific physical performance of 12 moderately trained soccer players using the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test, Level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1). Study 2 assessed the soccer-specific technical performance of 14 experienced soccer players using the Loughborough Soccer Passing and Shooting Tests (LSPT, LSST). Each test was performed on two occasions and preceded, in a randomized, counterbalanced order, by 30 min of the Stroop task (mentally fatiguing treatment) or 30 min of reading magazines (control treatment). Subjective ratings of mental fatigue were measured before and after treatment, and mental effort and motivation were measured after treatment. Distance run, heart rate, and ratings of perceived exertion were recorded during the Yo-Yo IR1. LSPT performance time was calculated as original time plus penalty time. LSST performance was assessed using shot speed, shot accuracy, and shot sequence time. Subjective ratings of mental fatigue and effort were higher after the Stroop task in both studies (P motivation was similar between conditions. This mental fatigue significantly reduced running distance in the Yo-Yo IR1 (P performance time were not different between conditions; however, penalty time significantly increased in the mental fatigue condition (P = 0.015). Mental fatigue also impaired shot speed (P = 0.024) and accuracy (P performance.\n[Factors related to severe dengue during an epidemic in Vitoria, State of Espirito Santo, Brazil, 2011](https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=dedup_wf_001::071947a9713691f2cc247de5ca560c7b)\nVicente, Creuza Rachel; Lauar, Julia Castanheira; Santos, Bruna Silva; Cobe, Victor Marchesi; Cerutti Junior, Crispim\n2013-01-01\nIntroduction The prognosis of dengue depends on early diagnosis and treatment, which can help prevent severe forms whose characteristics were evaluated here.

Women with vaginal delivery at a Mexico City public hospital, without complications before the hospital discharge, were interviewed seven days after delivery. Time of postpartum discharge was classified as early (25 hours). The dependent variable was defined as the occurrence and severity of puerperal complication symptoms. Out of 303 women, 208 (68%) were discharged early. However, women with early discharge and satisfactory prenatal care had lower odds of presenting symptoms in early puerperium than women without early discharge and inadequate prenatal care (OR 0.36; 95% confidence intervals = 0.17-0.76). There was no association between early discharge and symptoms of complications during the first postpartum week; the odds of complications were lower for mothers with early discharge and satisfactory prenatal care.\n[Effect of Carbohydrate, Caffeine, and Carbohydrate + Caffeine Mouth Rinsing on Intermittent Running Performance in Collegiate Male Lacrosse Athletes.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28825605)\nDolan, Patrick; Witherbee, Kyle E; Peterson, Kimi M; Kerksick, Chad M\n2017-09-01\nDolan, P, Witherbee, KE, Peterson, KM, and Kerksick, CM. Effect of carbohydrate, caffeine, and carbohydrate + caffeine mouth rinsing on intermittent running performance in collegiate male lacrosse athletes. J Strength Cond Res 31(9): 2473-2479, 2017-Recently, an interest has developed in the potential to rinse the oral cavity with key nutrients to impact various types of exercise and presumably sporting performance. Although multiple studies examining carbohydrate mouth rinsing have been completed, conflicting evidence surrounding caffeine mouth rinsing persists, and no research has explored its ability to impact high-intensity, intermittent running performance. This study investigated the independent and synergistic ability of carbohydrate and caffeine mouth rinsing to improve intermittent running performance. The Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test-Level 1 (Yo-Yo Level 1) was completed in 10 collegiate (National Collegiate Athletic Association [NCAA] Division II) male lacrosse players after a 10-second mouth rinse with a solution of either carbohydrate (CHO), caffeine (CAF), carbohydrate + caffeine (CHO + CAF), placebo (H2O), or a no rinse control (CON). No significant improvements in Yo-Yo IRT-1 performance were found (p > 0.05). Perceptual indications of effort (i.e., rating of their perceived exertion [RPE]) were significantly lower (p \u2264 0.05) in CHO and CHO + CAF when compared with CON after speed level 11. Interestingly, RPE levels were nonsignificantly lower in all but one level of the Yo-Yo Level 1 for CHO in comparison with other groups. Carbohydrate and caffeine mouth rinsing seems to exert no impact on running performance before maximal intermittent running in a group of male collegiate lacrosse players.\n[Effect of additional speed endurance training on performance and muscle adaptations](http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/229949975) [DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nGunnarsson, Thomas; Christensen, Peter M\u00f8ller; Holse, Kris\n2012-01-01\nPURPOSE: The present study examined the effect of additional speed-endurance training during the season on muscle adaptations and performance of trained soccer players.

In a double blind, randomised, cross-over design, ten male university-standard soccer players (age 19 \u00b1 1 y, stature 1.80 \u00b1 0.10 m, body mass 75.5 \u00b1 4.8 kg) masticated a caffeinated (200 mg; caffeine) or control (0 mg; placebo) gum on two separate occasions. After a standardised warm-up, gum was chewed for 5 min and subsequently expectorated 5 min before players performed a maximal countermovement jump, a 20 m sprint test and the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-YoIR1). Performance on 20 m sprints were not different between trials (caffeine: 3.2 \u00b1 0.3 s, placebo: 3.1 \u00b1 0.3 s; p = 0.567; small effect size: d = 0.33), but caffeine did allow players to cover 2.0% more distance during Yo-YoIR1 (caffeine: 1754 \u00b1 156 m, placebo: 1719 \u00b1 139 m; p = 0.016; small effect size: d = 0.24) and increase maximal countermovement jump height by 2.2% (caffeine: 47.1 \u00b1 3.4 cm, placebo: 46.1 \u00b1 3.2 cm; p = 0.008; small effect size: d = 0.30). Performance on selected physical tests (Yo-YoIR1 and countermovement jump) was improved by the chewing of caffeinated gum in the immediate period before testing in university-standard soccer players but the sizes of such effects were small. Such findings may have implications for the recommendations made to soccer players about to engage with subsequent exercise performance.\n[Game-induced fatigue patterns in elite female soccer.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20072057)\nKrustrup, Peter; Zebis, Mette; Jensen, Jack M; Mohr, Magni\n2010-02-01\nThe purpose was to examine the fatigue pattern of elite female soccer players after competitive games. Soccer players (n = 23) from the Danish women Premier League performed a countermovement vertical jump test, a repeated 30-m sprint test, and the Yo-Yo intermittent endurance level 2 (Yo-Yo IE2) test at rested state and after a competitive game. Average heart rate during the game was 86 +/- 1% of maximal heart rate with no differences between halves. Blood lactate was 5.1 +/- 0.5 mmol.L after the first half, which was higher (p game, which was 62% lower (p game, which was 4% slower (p game-induced effect was observed on vertical jump performance. Significant inverse correlations were observed between Yo-Yo IE2 test performance and fatigue index during the repeated sprint test both at rest (r = -0.76, p game (r = -0.66, p game does cause marked impairment in intense intermittent exercise and repeated sprint performance but does not affect vertical jump performance.

Market instruments work by creating a market price for emissions and use the market to encourage reductions at the lowest price, which is done by placing limits on greenhouse gas emissions and allowing the market to decide where reductions occur, or by imposing a carbon tax or emissions charge. While they can be applied within a sector, they are usually used to encourage reductions throughout the economy or across large sectors. Credit for early action also creates an incentive for emissions reductions throughout the economy or at least across many sectors. Credit for early action tools do not work by either imposing a carbon tax or emissions charge or placing limits on emissions, rather they promise that entities that take action against greenhouse gases prior to the imposition of a carbon tax or emissions limits will receive a credit against future taxes or limits. An overview is provided of the Kyoto Protocol and the rationale for taking early action, and a review is included of the theory and specific proposals for market instruments and credit for early action. A comparative analysis is provided of these approaches by examining their relative efficiency, environmental effectiveness, and impacts on the redistribution of wealth. Credit for early action is viewed as problematic on a number of counts and is seen as an interim strategy for imposition while political support for market instruments develop. The environmental effectiveness of credit for early action is very difficult to predict, and credit for early action programs do not yield the lowest cost emissions reductions. Credit for early action programs will not achieve compliance with the Kyoto Protocol at the lowest cost, and credits for early action will increase the compliance costs for those who\n[Validity and reliability of 6-a-side small-sided game locomotor performance in assessing physical fitness in football players.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26630259)\nStevens, Tom Gerardus Antonia; De Ruiter, Cornelis Johannes; Beek, Peter Jan; Savelsbergh, Geert Jozef Peter\n2016-01-01\nIn order to determine whether small-sided game (SSG) locomotor performance can serve as a fitness indicator, we (1) compared 6-a-side (6v6) SSG-intensity of players varying in fitness and skill, (2) examined the relationship of the 6v6-SSG and Yo-Yo IR2 and (3) assessed the reliability of the 6v6-SSG. Thirty-three professional senior, 30 professional youth, 62 amateur and 16 professional woman football players performed 4 \u00d7 7 min 6v6-SSGs recorded by a Local Position Measurement system. A substantial subgroup (N = 113) also performed the Yo-Yo IR2. Forty-seven amateur players performed two or three 6v6-SSGs. No differences in 6v6-SSG time-motion variables were found between professional senior and professional youth players. Amateurs showed lower values than professional seniors on almost all time-motion variables (ES = 0.59-1.19). Women displayed lower high-intensity time-motion variables than all other subgroups. Total distance run during 6v6-SSG was only moderately related to Yo-Yo IR2 distance (r = 0.45), but estimated metabolic power, high speed (>14.4 km \u00b7 h(-1)), high acceleration (>2 m \u00b7 s(-2)), high power (>20 W \u00b7 kg(-1)) and very high (35 W \u00b7 kg(-1)) power showed higher correlations (r = 0.59-0.70) with Yo-Yo IR2 distance. Intraclass correlation coefficient values were higher for total distance (0.84) than other time-motion variables (0.74\u20120.78). Although total distance and metabolic power during 6v6-SSG showed good reproducibility (coefficient of variation (CV) < 5%), CV was higher (8-14%) for all high-intensity time-motion variables. It was therefore concluded that standardised SSG locomotor performance cannot serve used as a valid and reliable fitness indicator for individual players.\n[Racismo/sexismo epist\u00e9mico, universidades occidentalizadas y los cuatro genocidios/ epistemicidios del largo siglo XVI](http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=39630036002) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nRAM\u00d3N GROSFOGUEL\n2013-01-01\nFull Text Available Este art\u00edculo analiza el racismo/sexismo epist\u00e9mico fundacional a las estructuras de conocimiento de la universidad occidentalizada.

This Early Appropriate Care (EAC) protocol was applied to patients with advanced age to determine if they require unique parameters to mitigate complications. Between October 2010 and March 2013, 376 consecutive skeletally mature patients with unstable fractures of the pelvis, acetabulum, thoracolumbar spine, and/or proximal or diaphyseal femur fractures were treated at a level I trauma center and were prospectively studied. Patients aged \u226430 years (n = 114), 30 to 60 years (n = 184), and \u226560 years (n = 37) with Injury Severity Scores (ISS) \u226516 and unstable fractures of the pelvis, acetabulum, spine, and/or diaphyseal femur were treated within 36 h, provided they showed evidence of adequate resuscitation. ISS, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification were determined. Lactate, pH, and base excess (BE) were measured at 8-h intervals. Complications included pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure (MOF), deep vein thrombosis, infection, sepsis, and death. Patients \u226430 years old (y/o) were more likely to sustain gunshot wounds (p = 0.039), while those \u226560 y/o were more likely to fall from a height (p = 0.002). Complications occurred at similar rates for patients \u226430 y/o, 30 to 60 y/o, and \u226560 y/o. There were no differences in lactate, pH, or BE at the time of surgery. For patients \u226430 y/o, there were increased overall complications if pH was <7.30 (p = 0.042) or BE <-6.0 (p = 0.049); patients \u226560 y/o demonstrated more sepsis if BE was <-6.0 (p = 0.046). EAC aims to definitively manage axial and femoral shaft fractures once patients have been adequately resuscitated to minimize complications.

CP describes a group of disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation, that are attributed to disturbances that occurred in the fetal or infant brain. Therefore the paper starts with a summary of relevant information from developmental neuroscience. Most lesions underlying CP occur in the second half of gestation, when developmental activity in the brain reaches its summit. Variations in timing of the damage not only result in different lesions, but also in different neuroplastic reactions and different associated neuropathologies. This turns CP into a heterogeneous entity. This may mean that the best early diagnostics and the best intervention methods may differ for various subgroups of children with CP. Next, the paper addresses possibilities for early diagnosis. It discusses the predictive value of neuromotor and neurological exams, neuro-imaging techniques and neurophysiological assessments. Prediction is best when complementary techniques are used in longitudinal series. Possibilities for early prediction of CP differ for infants admitted to neonatal intensive care and other infants. In the former group best prediction is achieved with the combination of neuro-imaging and the assessment of general movements, in the latter group best prediction is based on carefully documented milestones and neurological assessment. The last part reviews early intervention in infants developing CP. Most knowledge on early intervention is based on studies in high risk infants without CP. In these infants early intervention programs promote cognitive development until preschool age; motor development profits less. The few studies on early intervention in infants developing CP suggest that programs that stimulate all aspects of infant development by means of family coaching are most promising.

Prospective cohort study. Forty players from three recreational Australian football teams (Division One, Two and Three) underwent a battery of fitness tests (vertical jump, 10 and 40 m sprint, 6 m \u00d7 30 m repeated sprint test, Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level Two and 2-km time trial). The activity profiles of competitive match-play were quantified using 10-Hz Global Positioning System units. Division One players possessed greater maximum velocity, Yo-Yo level Two and 2-km time trial performances than Division Two and Three players. In addition, Division One players covered greater relative distance, and relative distances at moderate- and high-intensities during match-play than Division Two and Three players. Division Two players had better 2-km time trial performances than Division Three players. Positive associations (P football players competing at a higher level exhibit greater physical qualities and match-play activity profiles than lesser-skilled recreational players. Acceleration and maximum velocity, 2-km time trial and Yo-Yo level Two performances discriminate between players of different playing levels, and are related to physical match performance in recreational Australian football. The development of these qualities is likely to contribute to improved match performance in recreational Australian football players. Copyright \u00a9 2014 Sports Medicine Australia.

The objective of this study was to determine whether low-fat yogurt reduces biomarkers of chronic inflammation and endotoxin exposure in women. Premenopausal women (BMI 18\u00b75-27 and 30-40 kg/m2) were randomised to consume 339 g of low-fat yogurt (yogurt non-obese (YN); yogurt obese (YO)) or 324 g of soya pudding (control non-obese; control obese (CO)) daily for 9 weeks (n 30/group). Fasting blood samples were analysed for IL-6, TNF-\u03b1/soluble TNF II (sTNF-RII), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, anandamide, monocyte gene expression, soluble CD14 (sCD14), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS binding protein (LBP), IgM endotoxin-core antibody (IgM EndoCAb), and zonulin. BMI, waist circumference and blood pressure were also determined. After 9-week yogurt consumption, YO and YN had decreased TNF-\u03b1/sTNFR-RII. Yogurt consumption increased plasma IgM EndoCAb regardless of obesity status. sCD14 was not affected by diet, but LBP/sCD14 was lowered by yogurt consumption in both YN and YO. Yogurt intervention increased plasma 2-arachidonoylglycerol in YO but not YN. YO peripheral blood mononuclear cells expression of NF-\u03baB inhibitor \u03b1 and transforming growth factor \u03b21 increased relative to CO at 9 weeks. Other biomarkers were unchanged by diet. CO and YO gained approximately 0\u00b79 kg in body weight. YO had 3\u00b76 % lower diastolic blood pressure at week 3.

However there are few epidemiological studies on normal total sleep time (TST in representative groups of teen-agers which allow to get normative data. PURPOSE: To explore perceived total sleep time on schooldays (TSTS and non schooldays (TSTN and the prevalence of sleep initiating insomnia among a nationally representative sample of teenagers. METHODS: Data from 9,251 children aged 11 to 15 years-old, 50.7% of which were boys, as part of the cross-national study 2011 HBSC were analyzed. Self-completion questionnaires were administered in classrooms. An estimate of TSTS and TSTN (week-ends and vacations was calculated based on specifically designed sleep habits report. Sleep deprivation was estimated by a TSTN - TSTS difference >2 hours. Sleep initiating nsomnia was assessed according to International classification of sleep disorders (ICSD 2. Children who reported sleeping 7 hours or less per night were considered as short sleepers. RESULTS: A serious drop of TST was observed between 11 yo and 15 yo, both during the schooldays (9 hours 26 minutes vs. 7 h 55 min.; p<0.001 and at a lesser extent during week-ends (10 h 17 min. vs. 9 h 44 min.; p<0.001. Sleep deprivation concerned 16.0% of chidren aged of 11 yo vs. 40.5% of those of 15 yo (p<0.001. Too short sleep was reported by 2.6% of the 11 yo vs. 24.6% of the 15 yo (p<0.001. CONCLUSION: Despite the obvious need for sleep in adolescence, TST drastically decreases with age among children from 11 to 15 yo which creates significant sleep debt increasing with age.\n[T\u00e4na kell 19.30 avatakse reisisadama endises politseimajas...](http://ise.elnet.ee/search~S1?/XAzrizal+AND+fauzi&searchscope=1&SORT=D&Da=1980&Db=2018/XAzrizal+AND+fauzi&searchscope=1&SORT=D&Da=1980&Db=2018&SUBKEY=Azrizal+AND+fauzi/1%2C7%2C7%2CB/frameset&FF=XAzrizal+AND+fauzi&searchscope=1&SORT=D&Da=1980&Db=2018&5%2C5%2C)\n2005-01-01\nRanna-ala arenguv\u00f5imalusi tutvustav n\u00e4itus \"Tagasi mere juurde.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of sodium bicarbonate intake on Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 2 performance in trained young men. Thirteen men aged 23 \u00b1 1 year (height: 180 \u00b1 2 cm, weight: 78 \u00b1 3 kg; VO2max: 61.3 \u00b1 3.3 mlO2 \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 min(-1); means \u00b1 SEM) performed the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 2 (Yo-Yo IR2) on two separate occasions in randomized order with (SBC) and without (CON) prior intake of sodium bicarbonate (0.4 g \u00b7 kg(-1) body weight). Heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured during the test and venous blood samples were taken frequently. Yo-Yo IR2 performance was 14 % higher (P = 0.04) in SBC than in CON (735 \u00b1 61 vs 646 \u00b1 46 m, respectively). Blood pH and bicarbonate were similar between trials at baseline, but higher (P = 0.003) immediately prior to the Yo-Yo IR2 test in SBC than in CON (7.44 \u00b1 0.01 vs 7.32 \u00b1 0.01 and 33.7 \u00b1 3.2 vs 27.3 \u00b1 0.6 mmol \u00b7 l(-1), respectively). Blood lactate was 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 and 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 mmol \u00b7 l(-1) at baseline and increased to 11.3 \u00b1 1.4 and 9.4 \u00b1 0.8 mmol \u00b7 l(-1) at exhaustion in SBC and CON, respectively, being higher (P = 0.03) in SBC. Additionally, peak blood lactate was higher (P = 0.02) in SBC than in CON (11.7 \u00b1 1.2 vs 10.2 \u00b1 0.7 mmol \u00b7 l(-1)). Blood glucose, plasma K(+) and Na(+) were not different between trials. Peak heart rate reached at exhaustion was 197 \u00b1 3 and 195 \u00b1 3 bpm in SBC and CON, respectively, with no difference between conditions.

The measurements were performed on the first day of a training camp planned to finely select the players who would participate in the 2016 America's Rugby Championship. The magnitude-based inference was used in the comparisons. Backs demonstrated almost certainly greater distance in the Yo-Yo Test (backs: 2305.9\u00b1231.3 meters; forwards: 1802.4\u00b1361.2 meters), higher vertical jump height in both SJ and CMJ (SJ: 44.0\u00b15.3 cm vs. 37.6\u00b15.4 cm; CMJ: 46.1\u00b15.0 cm vs. 40.0\u00b15.5 cm, for backs and forwards respectively), and superior sprint velocity in 10- and 30-m (10-m: 6.02\u00b10.23 m.s-1 vs. 5.51\u00b10.34 m.s-1; 30-m: 7.46\u00b10.25 m.s-1 vs. 6.89\u00b10.37 m.s-1, for backs and forwards respectively) than the forwards. In contrast, forwards were almost certainly taller and heavier than backs, and displayed higher sprint momentum in 10- and 30-meters (10 meters: 513.0\u00b151.6 kg.m.s-1 vs. 598.4\u00b153.1 kg.m.s-1; 30 meters: 635.3\u00b156.1 kg.m.s-1 vs. 749.0\u00b170.5 kg.m.s-1, for backs and forwards respectively). The submaximal HR in the first 2-minutes of the Yo-Yo test was likely lower in the backs than in the forwards (77.6\u00b15.1% of the maximal HR vs. 81.3\u00b15.4% of the maximal HR for backs and forwards respectively), while HRV indices were not different between backs and forwards. Playing position appears to be determined by the players' physical and physiological characteristics in top-level rugby union, and the submaximal HR measured during Yo-Yo test can be a simple alternative to discriminate backs and forwards.\n[Effects of a 6-month football intervention program on bone mass and physical fitness in overweight children](https://curis.ku.dk/ws/files/164438612/Seabra_et_al_Spine_Research_2016_Vol_2_1_09.pdf) [DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nSeabra, Andr\u00e9; Serra, Hugo; Seabra, Ana\n2016-01-01\n, consisting of four weekly 60-90 min sessions with mean heart rate > 80%HRmax [football group (FG)].

Forty young soccer players aged between 10 and 14 years were randomly divided into control (CG; n = 10), vertical plyometric group (VG; n = 10), horizontal plyometric group (HG; n = 10), and combined vertical and horizontal plyometric group (VHG; n = 10). Players performance in the vertical and horizontal countermovement jump with arms, 5 multiple bounds test (MB5), 20-cm drop jump reactive strength index (RSI20), maximal kicking velocity (MKV), sprint, change of direction speed (CODS), Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 test (Yo-Yo IR1), and balance was measured. No significant or meaningful changes in the CG, apart from small change in the Yo-Yo IR1, were observed while all training programs resulted in meaningful changes in explosive, endurance, and balance performance. However, only VHG showed a statistically significant (p \u2264 0.05) increase in all performance test and most meaningful training effect difference with the CG across tests. Although no significant differences in performance changes were observed between experimental groups, the VHG program was more effective compared with VG (i.e., jumps, MKV, sprint, CODS, and balance performance) and HG (i.e., sprint, CODS, and balance performance) to small effect. The study demonstrated that vertical, horizontal, and combined vertical and horizontal jumps induced meaningful improvement in explosive actions, balance, and intermittent endurance capacity. However, combining vertical and horizontal drills seems more advantageous to induce greater performance improvements.\n[Effects of fatigue and time-out on physiological, time-motion indicators and in patterns of spatial organization of the teams in basketball](http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=235127552024) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nNuno Leite\n2013-01-01\nFull Text Available El objetivo de este estudio fue identificar los efectos de la fatiga en las variables fisiol\u00f3gicas, est\u00e1ndares de tiempo y movimiento y en la organizaci\u00f3n espacial de los equipos de baloncesto.

On the other hand, rare earth monoxides such as YO have been recognized as gaseous phase, and only EuO and YbO were thermodynamically stable solid-phase rock salt monoxides. In this study, solid-phase rock salt yttrium monoxide, YO, was synthesized in a form of epitaxial thin film by pulsed laser deposition method. YO possesses unusual valence of Y2+ ([Kr] 4d1) . In contrast with Y2O3, YO was narrow gap semiconductor with dark-brown color. The electrical conductivity was tunable from 10-1 to 103 \u03a9-1 cm-1 by introducing oxygen vacancies as electron donor. Weak antilocalization behavior was observed indicating significant spin-orbit coupling owing to 4 d electron carrier. The absorption spectral shape implies the Mott-Hubbard insulator character of YO.

A.\n2017-12-01\nEstablished populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) have recently been reported in South America, at both Atlantic and Pacific basins. Several studies have evaluated different aspects of their life histories; however, little is known about the use of the estuaries by the juveniles of these populations. We examined spawning time, seaward migration timing, growth rate, scale patterns, diet, and geometric morphometric, contrasting the early life history during freshwater and estuary residence of a chinook population established in Lapataia Basin. Fall run spawning took place in March-April and the parr emerged in September. Two distinct seaward migration patterns were identified from sein net fishing records: one population segment migrating earlier to the estuary in October and a second group migrating later in February. The growth rate of fish captured at the estuary was significantly higher than the fish captured in freshwater. In addition, higher scale intercirculi distances were observed in estuary fish showing differences in growth rate. The feeding habitat in fish captured in both environments changed through time from bottom feeding to surface feeding and from significant diet overlap to no overlap. The morphology of the fish captured at the estuary was associated with the elongation of the caudal peduncle and a decrease in the condition factor index, both changes related to smolt transformation. The earlier migration and the higher growth rate of juveniles in the estuary together with fish of 1 + yo captured in this environment reveal that the estuary of Lapataia Basin is not only a stopover for the chinook salmon, but also a key habitat to reside and feed previous to the final seaward migration.\n[Long-term patency of experimental magnetic compression gastroenteric anastomoses achieved with covered stents.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11375591)\nCope, C; Ginsberg, G G\n2001-06-01\nOur aim was to evaluate the efficacy of a prototype \"YO-YO\"-shaped covered stent for keeping experimental magnetic compression gastroenteric fistulas patent for 6 months. Magnets were introduced perorally with endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance and were mated across the gastric and jejunal walls of 5 dogs. After a mean of 5.5 days a 12-mm diameter YO-YO stent was placed perorally in the resulting fistula. The gastroenteric anastomosis (GEA) with stent was observed endoscopically and gastrographically at 1- to 2-month intervals. There was no morbidity and there were no significant weight changes. The GEA was widely patent at necropsy at 6 months (n = 4); partial membrane separation occurred at 5 months in the fifth dog. There was minor breakage of the stent prongs in 2 animals. Peroral creation of a stented magnetic compression GEA is safe and provides long-term patency. This technique may be potentially useful for managing gastric outlet obstruction caused by malignancy.\n[Intermittent Testing and Training for High-Level Football Players](http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/2398295012) [DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nIngebrigtsen, J\u00f8rgen\nFootball is the most popular sport in the world, played by over 400 million men and women.

Sixteen young female basketball players were randomly allocated to intermittent training (IT=8) or repeated sprint ability training (RST=8) groups. The following outcomes were measured at baseline and after 6 weeks of training: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (Yo-Yo) and repeated sprint ability (RSA) tests. For all the variables investigated the effect of training type showed a different trend respect at current knowledge. In the RSA, best time (BT) was a significant main effect of training time (pre- vs. post-) (Ptraining type/time (P=0.03). The RST showed a decrease in BT of 3.1% (P=0.005) while the IT showed a decrease of 6.2% (Ptraining methods used in this study can be an effective training strategy for inducing anaerobic and basketball-specific training schedules. Besides, even when IT training is not done at very high speed, it can increase the maximum speed of the RSA.\n[A test to evaluate the physical impact on technical performance in soccer](http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/31966364) [DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nRostgaard, Thomas; Iaia, F.

To illustrate these features in healthy children. The FMA, the PCFV, and the ossification of 12 synchondroses according to the Madeline and Elster scale were retrospectively analyzed in 235 healthy children using millimeter slices on a computed tomography scan. The mean FMA of 6.49 cm in girls was significantly inferior to the FMA of 7.67 cm in boys (P < .001). In both sexes, the growth evolved in a 2-phase process, with a phase of rapid growth from birth to 3.75 years old (yo) followed by a phase of stabilization. In girls, the first phase was shorter (ending at 2.6 yo) than in boys (ending at 4.33 yo) and proceeded at a higher rate. PCFV was smaller in girls (P < .001) and displayed a biphasic pattern in the whole population, with a phase of rapid growth from birth to 3.58 yo followed by a phase of slow growth until 16 yo. In girls, the first phase was more active and shorter (ending at 2.67 yo) than in boys (ending at 4.5 yo). The posterior interoccipital synchondroses close first, followed by the anterior interoccipital and occipitomastoidal synchondroses, the lambdoid sutures simultaneously, then the petro-occipital and spheno-occipital synchondroses simultaneously. The data provide a chronology of synchondrosis closure. We showed that FMA and PCFV are constitutionally smaller in girls at birth (P \u2264 .02) and suggest that a sex-related difference in the FMA is related to earlier closure of anterior interoccipital synchondroses in girls (P = .01).

Three groups of young soccer players (age 13.0 \u00b1 2.3 years) were divided into: control (CG; n = 8) and plyometric training with (PPT; n = 8) and without (NPPT; n = 8) a progressive increase in volume (i.e., 16 jumps per leg per week, with an initial volume of 80 jumps per leg each session). Bilateral and unilateral horizontal and vertical countermovement jump with arms (CMJA), 20-cm drop jump reactive strength index (RSI20), maximal kicking velocity (MKV), 10-m sprint, change of direction speed (CODS), and Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 test (Yo-Yo IR1) were measured. Although both experimental groups significantly increased CMJA, RSI20, CODS, and endurance performance, only PPT showed a significant improvement in MKV and 10-m sprint time. In addition, only PPT showed a significantly higher performance improvement in jumping, MKV, and Yo-Yo IR1 compared with CG. Also, PPT showed higher meaningful improvement compared with NPPT in all (except 1) jump performance measures. Furthermore, although PPT involved a higher total volume compared with NPPT, training efficiency (i.e., percentage change in performance/total jump volume) was similar between groups. Our results show that PPT and NPPT ensured significant improvement in muscle explosive and endurance performance measures. However, a progressive increase in plyometric training volume seems more advantageous to induce soccer-specific performance improvements.\n[Recent Coverage of Early Childhood Education Approaches in Open Access Early Childhood Journals](https://eric.ed.gov/?q=journals&pg=2&id=EJ1116908)\nKeskin, Burhanettin\n2016-01-01\nA content analysis of the coverage of the major approaches to early childhood education in the early childhood research journals, published between 2010 and 2014, that are early childhood research oriented and have free online access were investigated.

Although comorbidity in patients with late-onset AD (LO-AD) is common, for people with young-onset AD (YO-AD), it is unclear how often comorbidity occurs. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether comorbidity in patients with YO-AD differs from that in patients with LO-AD. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence, types of morbidity, and morbidity profiles in patients with YO-AD compared with those of patients with LO-AD. Explorative cohort study from 2 separate Dutch cohorts (Needs in Young-onset Dementia [NeedYD] and the Clinical Course of Cognition and Comorbidity-Dementia Study [4C-Dementia study]). Participants were recruited in 2007 and 2008 from (1) the memory clinics of 3 Dutch Alzheimer centers, (2) the memory clinics of general hospitals, (3) mental health services in the southern part of the Netherlands, and (4) young-onset dementia specialized day care facilities. A comparison group of community-dwelling, elderly patients with AD was selected from the 4C-Dementia study. Patients in this study were recruited in 2010 and 2011 from the aforementioned Alzheimer centers. The prevalence rates of comorbidity were compared between 177 patients with YO-AD and 155 patients with LO-AD. Comorbidity was classified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The total amount of comorbidity was established by counting the number of existing diseases (ICD categories or chapters) and comorbidity was also dichotomized as present or absent. Furthermore, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to study clusters of comorbidity. Compared with LO-AD, patients with YO-AD showed less (P < .001) overall comorbidity (58.2% vs 86.5%) and had lower prevalence rates of diabetes, obesity, and circulatory diseases; however, the prevalence rates of diseases of the nervous system in YO-AD (6\n[Early Educational Intervention, Early Cumulative Risk, and the Early Home Environment as Predictors of Young Adult Outcomes within a High-Risk Sample](https://eric.ed.gov/?q=joseph+AND+campbell&pg=5&id=EJ872530)\nPungello, Elizabeth P.; Kainz, Kirsten; Burchinal, Margaret; Wasik, Barbara H.; Sparling, Joseph J.; Ramey, Craig T.; Campbell, Frances A.\n2010-01-01\nThe extent to which early educational intervention, early cumulative risk, and the early home environment were associated with young adult outcomes was investigated in a sample of 139 young adults (age 21) from high-risk families enrolled in randomized trials of early intervention.

Early menarche (\u226411 years) is a risk factor for both premature menopause (final menstrual period, FMP menopause (FMP 40-44 years), a risk that is amplified for nulliparous women. Women with either premature or early menopause face an increased risk of chronic conditions in later life and of early death. Findings from some studies suggest that early menarche and nulliparity are associated with early menopause, however overall the evidence is mixed. Much of the evidence for a direct relationship is hampered by a lack of comparability across studies, failure to adjust for confounding factors and inadequate statistical power. This pooled study comprises 51 450 postmenopausal women from nine observational studies in the UK, Scandinavia, Australia and Japan that contribute to the International collaboration for a Life course Approach to reproductive health and Chronic disease Events (InterLACE). Age at menarche (categorized as \u226411, 12, 13, 14 and 15 or more years) and parity (categorized as no children, one child and two or more children) were exposures of interest. Age at FMP was confirmed by at least 12 months of cessation of menses where this was not the result of an intervention (such as surgical menopause due to bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy) and categorized as premature menopause (FMP before age 40), early menopause (FMP 40-44 years), 45-49 years, 50-51 years, 52-53 years and 54 or more years. We used multivariate multinomial logistic regression models to estimate relative risk ratio (RRR) and 95% CI for associations between menarche, parity and age at FMP adjusting for within-study correlation. The median age at FMP was 50 years (interquartile range 48-53 years), with 2% of the women experiencing premature menopause and 7.6% early menopause.

S. Nikitin\n2014-01-01\nFull Text Available Late-onset Pompe-disease (LOPD is an adult form of the glycogenosis type II. The age of onset ranges from 1 till 75 y.o. and older. The diagnosis of LOPD is based on the presence of trunk and limb-girdle muscle weakness with hyperlordosis, respiratory failure, ocasionally accompanied by cardiomyopathy, persistent mild elevation of creatine kinase, dry blood spot test of the enzyme activity and DNA-analysis of GAA-gene. Early recognition of the LOPD and beginning of the enzyme replacement therapy is important in preventing severe motor and respiratory deficit, the patient disability and in increasing the survival in those patients.\n[Impact of a soccer match on the cardiac autonomic control of referees.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21997680)\nBoullosa, Daniel Alexandre; Abreu, Laurinda; Tuimil, Jos\u00e9 Luis; Leicht, Anthony Scott\n2012-06-01\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a soccer match on the cardiac autonomic control of heart rate (HR) in soccer referees. Sixteen Spanish regional and third division referees (11 males: 26 \u00b1 7 years, 74.4 \u00b1 4.1 kg, 178 \u00b1 3 cm, Yo-Yo IR1 ~600-1,560 m; 5 females: 22 \u00b1 3 years, 59.3 \u00b1 4.8 kg, 158 \u00b1 8 cm, Yo-Yo IR1 ~200-520 m) participated with 24-h HR recordings measured with a Polar RS800 during a rest and a match day. Autonomic control of HR was assessed from HR variability (HRV) analysis. Inclusion of a soccer match (92.5% spent at >75% maximum HR) reduced pre-match (12:00-17:00 hours; small to moderate), post-match (19:00-00:00 hours; moderate to almost perfect), and night-time (00:00-05:00 hours; small to moderate) HRV. Various moderate-to-large correlations were detected between resting HRV and the rest-to-match day difference in HRV. The rest-to-match day differences of low and high-frequency bands ratio (LF/HF) and HR in the post-match period were moderately correlated with time spent at different exercise intensities. Yo-Yo IR1 performance was highly correlated with jump capacity and peak lactate, but not with any HRV parameter. These results suggest that a greater resting HRV may allow referees to tolerate stresses during a match day with referees who spent more time at higher intensities during matches exhibiting a greater LF/HF increment in the post-match period. The relationship between match activities, [Formula: see text] and HR recovery kinetics in referees and team sport athletes of different competitive levels remains to be clarified.\n[Effects of in-season short-term aerobic and high-intensity interval training program on repeated sprint ability and jump performance in handball players.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27849114)\nHermassi, Souhail; Ingebrigtsen, J\u00f8rgen; Schwesig, Ren\u00e9; Fieseler, Georg; Delank, Karl-Stefan; Chamari, Karim; Shephard, Roy J; Chelly, Mohamed-Souhaiel\n2018-01-01\nThis study examined the effects of a 7-week in-season aerobic and high-intensity interval-training program on performance tests linked to successful handball play (e.g., repeated sprint and jumping ability). Thirty participants (age 17.0\u00b11.2 years, body mass 81.1\u00b13.4 kg, height 1.82\u00b10.07 m) performed a Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1), a squat (SJ) and a Countermovement Jump Test (CMJ), as well as a repeated Sprint Ability Test (RSA). From this, maximal aerobic speed (MAS, reached at the end of the Yo-Yo IR1), jumping ability, best time in a single sprint trial (RSAbest), total time (RSATT) and the performance decrement (RSAdec) during all sprints were calculated. Later, subjects were randomly assigned to a control group (CG; N.=15) performing their normal training schedule (5 weekly sessions of ~90 minutes of handball training) or an experimental group (EG; N.=15). The EG performed two 30 min sessions per week of high-intensity aerobic exercises at 100-130% of MAS in addition to their normal training schedule. A significant improvement in MAS (d=4.1), RSAbest (d=1.9), RSATT (d=1.5) and RSAdec (d=2.3) after the training period was demonstrated. Also, significant interaction effects (time x group) were found for all parameters as the EG significantly improved performances in all tests after training. The greatest interaction effects were observed in MAS (\u03b72=0.811) and CMJ (\u03b72=0.759). No relevant changes in test performances were found in the CG (mean d=-0.02). These results indicate that individually speed-controlled aerobic and interval training is effective for improving specific handball performance.\n[Activity Profiles and Physiological Responses of Representative Tag Football Players in Relation to Playing Position and Physical Fitness](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4671542)\n2015-01-01\nThis study determined the physical fitness, match-activity profiles and physiological responses of representative tag football players and examined the relationship between physical fitness and the match-activity profile. Microtechnology devices and heart rate (HR) chest straps were used to determine the match-activity profiles of sixteen tag football players for five matches during the 2014 Australian National Championships. The relationships between lower body muscular power, straight line running speed and Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 2 (Yo-Yo IR2) and the match-activity profile were examined using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients. Outside players had greater lower body muscular power (ES = 0.98) and straight line running speed (ES = 1.03\u20131.18) than inside players, and also covered greater very high-speed running (VHSR) distance/min (ES = 0.67) and reached higher peak running speeds (ES = 0.95) during matches. Inside and outside players performed a similar number of repeated high-intensity effort (RHIE) bouts and reported similar mean and maximum efforts per RHIE bout. However, there were differences between playing positions for mean and maximal RHIE effort durations (ES = 0.69\u20131.15) and mean RHIE bout recovery (ES = 0.56). Inside and outside players also reported small to moderate differences (ES = 0.43\u20130.80) for times spent in each HR zone. There were a number of moderate to very large correlations between physical fitness measures and match-activity profile variables. This study found lower body muscular power, straight line running speed and Yo-Yo IR2 to be related to the match-activities of representative tag football players, although differences between inside and outside players suggest that athlete testing and training practices should be modified for different playing positions.

This in turn would result in additional improvement in the maximum performance of the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test in comparison with interval training alone. Eighteen male nonprofessional athletes were allocated to either an inspiratory muscle loading (IML) group or control group. Both groups participated in a 6-week interval running program consisting of 3-4 workouts (1-3 sets of various repetitions of selected distance [100-2,400 m] per workout) per week. For the IML group, 4-week IM training (30 inspiratory efforts at 50% maximal static inspiratory pressure [P0] per set, 2 sets\u00b7d-1, 6 d\u00b7wk-1) was applied before the interval program. Specific IM warm-up (2 sets of 30 inspiratory efforts at 40% P0) was performed before each workout of the program. For the control group, neither IML was applied. In comparison with the control group, the interval training volume as indicated by the repeatability of running bouts at high intensity was approximately 27% greater in the IML group. Greater increase in the maximum performance of the Yo-Yo test (control: 16.9 \u00b1 5.5%; IML: 30.7 \u00b1 4.7% baseline value) was also observed after training. The enhanced exercise performance was partly attributable to the greater reductions in the sensation of breathlessness and whole-body metabolic stress during the Yo-Yo test. These findings show that the combination of chronic and acute IML into a high-intensity interval running program is a beneficial training strategy for enhancing the tolerance to high-intensity intermittent bouts of running.\n[Influence of oxygen uptake kinetics on physical performance in youth soccer.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27436343)\nDoncaster, Greg; Marwood, Simon; Iga, John; Unnithan, Viswanath\n2016-09-01\nTo examine the relationship between oxygen uptake kinetics (VO2 kinetics) and physical measures associated with soccer match play, within a group of highly trained youth soccer players. Seventeen highly trained youth soccer players (age: 13.3 \u00b1 0.4 year, self-assessed Tanner stage: 3 \u00b1 1) volunteered for the study. Players initially completed an incremental treadmill protocol to exhaustion, to establish gaseous exchange threshold (GET) and VO2max (59.1 \u00b1 5.4 mL kg(-1) min(-1)). On subsequent visits, players completed a step transition protocol from rest-moderate-intensity exercise, followed by an immediate transition, and from moderate- to severe-intensity exercise (moderate: 95 % GET, severe: 60 %\u2206), during which VO2 kinetics were determined. Physical soccer-based performance was assessed using a maximal Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) and via GPS-derived measures of physical soccer performance during soccer match play, three 2 \u00d7 20 min, 11 v 11 matches, to gain measures of physical performance during soccer match play. Partial correlations revealed significant inverse relationships between the unloaded-to-moderate transition time constant (tau) and: Yo-Yo IR1 performance (r = -0.58, P = 0.02) and GPS variables [total distance (TD): r = -0.64, P = 0.007, high-speed running (HSR): r = -0.64, P = 0.008 and high-speed running efforts (HSReff): r = -0.66, P = 0.005]. Measures of VO2 kinetics are related to physical measures associated with soccer match play and could potentially be used to distinguish between those of superior physical performance, within a group of highly trained youth soccer players.\n[Adding heat to the live-high train-low altitude model: a practical insight from professional football](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3903152)\nBuchheit, M; Racinais, S; Bilsborough, J; Hocking, J; Mendez-Villanueva, A; Bourdon, P C; Voss, S; Livingston, S; Christian, R; P\u00e9riard, J; Cordy, J; Coutts, A J\n2013-01-01\nObjectives To examine with a parallel group study design the performance and physiological responses to a 14-day off-season \u2018live high-train low in the heat\u2019 training camp in elite football players. Methods Seventeen professional Australian Rules Football players participated in outdoor football-specific skills (32\u00b11\u00b0C, 11.5 h) and indoor strength (23\u00b11\u00b0C, 9.3 h) sessions and slept (12 nights) and cycled indoors (4.3 h) in either normal air (NORM, n=8) or normobaric hypoxia (14\u00b11 h/day, FiO2 15.2\u201314.3%, corresponding to a simulated altitude of 2500\u20133000 m, hypoxic (HYP), n=9). They completed the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery level 2 (Yo-YoIR2) in temperate conditions (23\u00b11\u00b0C, normal air) precamp (Pre) and postcamp (Post). Plasma volume (PV) and haemoglobin mass (Hbmass) were measured at similar times and 4 weeks postcamp (4WPost). Sweat sodium concentration ((Na+)sweat) was measured Pre and Post during a heat-response test (44\u00b0C). Results Both groups showed very large improvements in Yo-YoIR2 at Post (+44%; 90% CL 38, 50), with no between-group differences in the changes (\u22121%; \u22129, 9). Postcamp, large changes in PV (+5.6%; \u22121.8, 5.6) and (Na+)sweat (\u221229%; \u221237, \u221219) were observed in both groups, while Hbmass only moderately increased in HYP (+2.6%; 0.5, 4.5). At 4WPost, there was a likely slightly greater increase in Hbmass (+4.6%; 0.0, 9.3) and PV (+6%; \u22125, 18, unclear) in HYP than in NORM. Conclusions The combination of heat and hypoxic exposure during sleep/training might offer a promising \u2018conditioning cocktail\u2019 in team sports.

Recent work suggests that nitrate ingestion can also increase intermittent type exercise performance in recreational athletes. We hypothesized that six days of nitrate supplementation can improve high-intensity intermittent type exercise performance in trained soccer players. Thirty-two male soccer players (age: 23 \u00b1 1 years, height: 181 \u00b1 1 m, weight: 77 \u00b1 1 kg, playing experience: 15.2 \u00b1 0.5 years, playing in the first team of a 2nd or 3rd Dutch amateur league club participated in this randomized, double-blind cross-over study. All subjects participated in two test days in which high-intensity intermittent running performance was assessed using the Yo-Yo IR1 test. Subjects ingested nitrate-rich (140 mL; ~800 mg nitrate/day; BR or a nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (PLA for six subsequent days, with at least eight days of wash-out between trials. The distance covered during the Yo-Yo IR1 was the primary outcome measure, while heart rate (HR was measured continuously throughout the test, and a single blood and saliva sample were collected just prior to the test. Six days of BR ingestion increased plasma and salivary nitrate and nitrite concentrations in comparison to PLA (p < 0.001, and enhanced Yo-Yo IR1 test performance by 3.4 \u00b1 1.3% (from 1574 \u00b1 47 to 1623 \u00b1 48 m; p = 0.027. Mean HR was lower in the BR (172 \u00b1 2 vs. PLA trial (175 \u00b1 2; p = 0.014.

J.\n1998-01-01\nUnderstanding our own early biosphere is essential to our search for life elsewhere, because life arose on Earth very early and rocky planets shared similar early histories. The biosphere arose before 3.8 Ga ago, was exclusively unicellular and was dominated by hyperthermophiles that utilized chemical sources of energy and employed a range of metabolic pathways for CO2 assimilation. Photosynthesis also arose very early. Oxygenic photosynthesis arose later but still prior to 2.7 Ga. The transition toward the modern global environment was paced by a decline in volcanic and hydrothermal activity. These developments allowed atmospheric O2 levels to increase. The O2 increase created new niches for aerobic life, most notably the more advanced Eukarya that eventually spawned the megascopic fauna and flora of our modern biosphere.\n2010-04-21\n...

The nature of paternal influence on early embryo development has not been directly demonstrated although many studies have suggested effects from spermatozoal chromatin packaging, DNA damage, centriolar and mitotic spindle integrity, and plasma membrane integrity. The goal of this study was to determine whether early developmental events were affected by oxidative damage to the fertilizing sperm. Survival analysis was used to compare patterns of blastocyst formation based on P2 duration. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrate that relatively few embryos with short (P2 times reached blastocysts, and the two curves diverged beginning on day 4, with nearly all of the embryos with longer P2 times reaching blastocysts by day 6 (p < .01). We determined that duration of the 2nd to 3rd mitoses were sensitive periods in the presence of spermatozoal oxidative stress. Embryos that displayed either too long or too short cytokineses demonstrated an increased failure to reach blastocyst stage and therefore survive for further development. Although paternal-derived gene expression occurs later in development, this study suggests a specific role in early mitosis that is highly influenced by paternal factors.\n[Estr\u00e9s laboral en profesores de ense\u00f1anza secundaria: examinando el papel de las conductas y/o actitudes problem\u00e1ticas de los alumnos y la dificultad percibida en el manejo de conflictos.

In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral measures were utilized to investigate functional activation and functional connectivity (FC) in three-year-old (3yo) and six-year-old (6yo) children during sentence comprehension. Transitive German sentences varying the word order (subject-initial and object-initial) with case marking were presented auditorily. We selected children who were capable of processing the subject-initial sentences above chance level accuracy from each age group to ensure that we were tapping real comprehension. Both age groups showed a main effect of word order in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), with greater activation for object-initial compared to subject-initial sentences. However, age differences were observed in the FC between left pSTG and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The 6yo group showed stronger FC between the left pSTG and Brodmann area (BA) 44 of the left IFG compared to the 3yo group. For the 3yo group, in turn, the FC between left pSTG and left BA 45 was stronger than with left BA 44. Our study demonstrates that while task-related activation was comparable, the small behavioral differences between age groups were reflected in the underlying functional organization revealing the ongoing development of the neural language network.

Panegyres\n2016-01-01\nFull Text Available As the population of the world increases, there will be larger numbers of people with dementia and an emerging need for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Early dementia screening is the process by which a patient who might be in the prodromal phases of a dementing illness is determined as having, or not having, the hallmarks of a neurodegenerative condition. The concepts of mild cognitive impairment, or mild neurocognitive disorder, are useful in analyzing the patient in the prodromal phase of a dementing disease; however, the transformation to dementia may be as low as 10% per annum. The search for early dementia requires a comprehensive clinical evaluation, cognitive assessment, determination of functional status, corroborative history and imaging (including MRI, FDG-PET and maybe amyloid PET, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF examination assaying A\u03b21\u201342, T-\u03c4 and P-\u03c4 might also be helpful. Primary care physicians are fundamental in the screening process and are vital in initiating specialist investigation and treatment. Early dementia screening is especially important in an age where there is a search for disease modifying therapies, where there is mounting evidence that treatment, if given early, might influence the natural history\u2014hence the need for cost-effective screening measures for early dementia.\n[\u00abPara decir la palabra yo\u00bb: Una reflexi\u00f3n sobre la subjetividad en la obra de Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Valente](http://revistadeliteratura.revistas.csic.es/index.php/revistadeliteratura/article/view/61/67) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nFern\u00e1ndez Casanova, Manuel\n2008-06-01\nFull Text Available The so-called Question on the subject in Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Valente\u2019s Works is going to be analysed in this essay.

These systems help to ensure that timely warnings and vulnerability information are available to decision makers to anticipate and avert food crises. In the recent crisis in the Horn of Africa, alarming levels of acute malnutrition were documented from March 2010, and by August 2010, an impending food crisis was forecast. Despite these measures, the situation remained unrecognised, and further deteriorated causing malnutrition levels to grow in severity and scope. By the time the United Nations officially declared famine on 20 July 2011, and the humanitarian community sluggishly went into response mode, levels of malnutrition and mortality exceeded catastrophic levels. At this time, an estimated 11 million people were in desperate and immediate need for food. With warnings of food crises in the Sahel, South Sudan, and forecast of the drought returning to the Horn, there is an immediate need to institutionalize change in the health response during humanitarian emergencies. Early warning systems are only effective if they trigger an early response.\n[Early stages of bipolar disorder: characterization and strategies for early intervention](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462015000400012&lng=en&tlng=en) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nAdiel C.

Included in this review were articles that a characterized prodromal and first-episode stages of BD or b detailed efficacy and safety/tolerability of interventions in patients considered prodromal for BD or those with only one episode of mania/hypomania. Results: As research has only recently focused on characterization of the early phase of BD, there is little evidence for the effectiveness of any treatment option in the early phase of BD. Case management; individual, group, and family therapy; supportive therapy; and group psychoeducation programs have been proposed. Most evidence-based treatment guidelines for BD do not address treatment specifically in the context of the early stages of illness. Evidence for pharmacotherapy is usually presented in relation to illness polarity (i.e., manic/mixed or depressed or treatment phase. Conclusions: Although early recognition and treatment are critical to preventing unfavorable outcomes, there is currently little evidence for interventions in these stages of BD.\n[Employment and educational outcomes in early intervention programmes for early psychosis: a systematic review.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016950)\nBond, G R; Drake, R E; Luciano, A\n2015-10-01\nYoung adults with early psychosis want to pursue normal roles - education and employment. This paper summarises the empirical literature on the effectiveness of early intervention programmes for employment and education outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of employment/education outcomes for early intervention programmes, distinguishing three programme types: (1) those providing supported employment, (2) those providing unspecified vocational services and (3) those without vocational services. We summarised findings for 28 studies. Eleven studies evaluated early intervention programmes providing supported employment. In eight studies that reported employment outcomes separately from education outcomes, the employment rate during follow-up for supported employment patients was 49%, compared with 29% for patients receiving usual services. The two groups did not differ on enrolment in education. In four controlled studies, meta-analysis showed that the employment rate for supported employment participants was significantly higher than for control participants, odds ratio = 3.66 [1.93-6.93], p < 0.0001. Five studies (four descriptive and one quasi-experimental) of early intervention programmes evaluating unspecified vocational services were inconclusive. Twelve studies of early intervention programmes without vocational services were methodologically heterogeneous, using diverse methods for evaluating vocational/educational outcomes and precluding a satisfactory meta-analytic synthesis. Among studies with comparison groups, 7 of 11 (64%) reported significant vocational/education outcomes favouring early intervention over usual services. In early intervention programmes, supported employment moderately increases employment rates but not rates of enrolment in education. These improvements are in addition to the modest effects early programmes alone have on vocational/educational outcomes compared with usual services.\n[The Association between Early Conduct Problems and Early Marijuana Use in College Students](https://eric.ed.gov/?q=Marijuana&id=EJ932579)\nFalls, Benjamin J.; Wish, Eric D.; Garnier, Laura M.; Caldeira, Kimberly M.; O'Grady, Kevin E.; Vincent, Kathryn B.; Arria, Amelia M.\n2011-01-01\nEarly conduct problems have been linked to early marijuana use in adolescence.

We identified clinical and demographic disparities in time to tracheostomy. METHODS: We performed a level 3 retrospective prognostic study by querying the University HealthSystem Consortium (2007-2010) for adult patients receiving a tracheostomy after initial intubation. Time to tracheostomy was designated early ( 10 days). Cohorts were stratified by time to tracheostomy and compared using univariate tests of association and multivariable adjusted models. RESULTS: A total of 49,191 patients underwent tracheostomy after initial intubation: 42% early (n = 21,029) and 58% late (n = 28,162). On both univariate and multivariable analyses, women, blacks, Hispanics, and patients receiving Medicaid were less likely to receive an early tracheostomy. Patients in the early group also experienced lower rates of mortality (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Early tracheostomy was associated with increased survival. Yet, there were still significant disparities in time to tracheostomy according to sex, race, and type of insurance. Application of evidence-based algorithms for tracheostomy may reduce unequal treatment and improve overall mortality rates. Additional research into this apparent bias in referral/rendering of tracheostomy is needed.

The improvement in performance tests was accompanied by an increase in testosterone, creatine kinase, testosterone/creatine kinase ratio and in the majority of the Recovery Stress Questionnaire for Athletes scales. Cortisol and the social recovery and general well-being of Recovery Stress Questionnaire for Athletes scales decreased during the futsal pre-season. Conclusions: In summary, players improved their performance in the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Level 2 and Squat Jump tests in response to a futsal pre-season. Furthermore, the Internal Training Load behavior of the futsal training promoted a favorable hormonal anabolic environment and did not promote a negative disturbance in creatine kinase or stress/recovery balance, suggesting that futsal players did not report fatigue accumulation after this pre-season design.

This randomized control trail determined the effects of 11 weeks HMB supplementation on body mass and performance measures in 27 elite rugby players. \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylbutyrate group (n = 13), mean \u00b1 SD age 20.3 \u00b1 1.2 years, body mass 99.6 \u00b1 9.1 kg; placebo group (n = 14), age 21.9 \u00b1 2.8 years body mass 99.4 \u00b1 13.9 kg for placebo. During the supplementation period, body mass increased with HMB 0.57 \u00b1 2.60 kg but decreased with placebo 1.39 \u00b1 2.02 kg (p = 0.029). There were no significant differences in any of the 4 strength variables (p > 0.05). However, on the yo-yo intermittent recovery test (YoYo IR-1), the placebo group improved 4.0 \u00b1 2.8 levels but HMB decreased 2.0 \u00b1 3.0 levels (p = 0.003). The results of this study suggest that HMB could be beneficial for gaining or maintaining body mass during periods of increased training load. However, it appears that HMB may be detrimental to intermittent running ability in this group although further research is required before firm conclusions can be made. Only 6 participants on HMB managed to complete both YoYo IR-1 tests because of injury, a larger sample size is required to fully investigate this potentially negative effect. Further, the mechanisms behind this decrement in performance cannot be fully explained and requires further biochemical and psychological investigation.\n[Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)](https://www.etde.org/etdeweb/fieldedsearch.jsp)\nVerde, Licia; Jimenez, Raul [Institute of Cosmos Sciences, University of Barcelona, IEEC-UB, Mart\u00ed Franqu\u00e8s, 1, E08028 Barcelona (Spain); Bellini, Emilio [University of Oxford, Denys Wilkinson Building, Keble Road, Oxford, OX1 3RH (United Kingdom); Pigozzo, Cassio [Instituto de F\u00edsica, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, BA (Brazil); Heavens, Alan F., E-mail: liciaverde@icc.ub.edu, E-mail: emilio.bellini@physics.ox.ac.uk, E-mail: cpigozzo@ufba.br, E-mail: a.heavens@imperial.ac.uk, E-mail: raul.jimenez@icc.ub.edu [Imperial Centre for Inference and Cosmology (ICIC), Imperial College, Blackett Laboratory, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2AZ (United Kingdom)\n2017-04-01\nWe investigate our knowledge of early universe cosmology by exploring how much additional energy density can be placed in different components beyond those in the \u039bCDM model. To do this we use a method to separate early- and late-universe information enclosed in observational data, thus markedly reducing the model-dependency of the conclusions. We find that the 95% credibility regions for extra energy components of the early universe at recombination are: non-accelerating additional fluid density parameter \u03a9{sub MR} < 0.006 and extra radiation parameterised as extra effective neutrino species 2.3 < N {sub eff} < 3.2 when imposing flatness. Our constraints thus show that even when analyzing the data in this largely model-independent way, the possibility of hiding extra energy components beyond \u039bCDM in the early universe is seriously constrained by current observations. We also find that the standard ruler, the sound horizon at radiation drag, can be well determined in a way that does not depend on late-time Universe assumptions, but depends strongly on early-time physics and in particular on additional components that behave like radiation. We find that the standard ruler length determined in this way is r {sub s} = 147.4 \u00b1 0.7 Mpc if the radiation and neutrino components are standard, but the uncertainty increases by an order of magnitude when non-standard dark radiation components are allowed, to r {sub s} = 150 \u00b1 5 Mpc.\n[KARD\u0130YOVASK\u00dcLER HASTALIKLARA \u0130L\u0130\u015eK\u0130N T\u00dcRK\u0130YE TIBBI C\u0130HAZ SEKT\u00d6R\u00dc YO\u011eUNLA\u015eMA ANAL\u0130Z\u0130](http://dergipark.gov.tr/sosyalguvence/issue/23900/254714) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nFaruk KAHVEC\u0130O\u011eLU\n2016-08-01\nFull Text Available D\u00fcnya genelinde kardiyovask\u00fcler hastal\u0131klara ba\u011fl\u0131 \u00f6l\u00fcmler birinci s\u0131rada yer almaktad\u0131r, bu durum ilgili hastal\u0131klar\u0131n tan\u0131s\u0131, izlenmesi ve tedavisi amac\u0131yla kullan\u0131lan t\u0131bbi cihazlar\u0131n \u00f6nemini artt\u0131rmaktad\u0131r.

The increasing use of endoscopic submucosal dissection to treat early gastric cancer is a concern because regional lymph nodes are not addressed. The aim of the study was thus to critically evaluate current evidence with regard to tumour-specific factors associated with lymph node metastases in \"early gastric cancer\" to develop a more precise definition and improve clinical management. A systematic and comprehensive search of major reference databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Library) was undertaken using a combination of text words \"early gastric cancer\", \"lymph node metastasis\", \"factors\", \"endoscopy\", \"surgery\", \"lymphadenectomy\" \"mucosa\", \"submucosa\", \"lymphovascular invasion\", \"differentiated\", \"undifferentiated\" and \"ulcer\". All available publications that described tumour-related factors associated with lymph node metastases in early gastric cancer were included. The initial search yielded 1494 studies, of which 42 studies were included in the final analysis. Over time, the definition of early gastric cancer has broadened and the indications for endoscopic treatment have widened. The mean frequency of lymph node metastases increased on the basis of depth of infiltration (mucosa 6% vs. submucosa 28%), presence of lymphovascular invasion (absence 9% vs. presence 53%), tumour differentiation (differentiated 13% vs. undifferentiated 34%) and macroscopic type (elevated 13% vs. flat 26%) and tumour diameter (\u22642 cm 8% vs. >2 cm 25%). There is a need to re-examine the diagnosis and staging of early gastric cancer to ensure that patients with one or more identifiable risk factor for lymph node metastases are not denied appropriate chemotherapy and surgical resection.\n[Early psychosis workforce development: Core competencies for mental health professionals working in the early psychosis field.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28792114)\nOsman, Helen; Jorm, Anthony F; Killackey, Eoin; Francey, Shona; Mulcahy, Dianne\n2017-08-09\nThe aim of this study was to identify the core competencies required of mental health professionals working in the early psychosis field, which could function as an evidence-based tool to support the early psychosis workforce and in turn assist early psychosis service implementation and strengthen early psychosis model fidelity. The Delphi method was used to establish expert consensus on the core competencies. In the first stage, a systematic literature search was conducted to generate competency items. In the second stage, a panel consisting of expert early psychosis clinicians from around the world was formed. Panel members then rated each of the competency items on how essential they are to the clinical practice of all early psychosis clinicians. In total, 1023 pieces of literature including textbooks, journal articles and grey literature were reviewed. A final 542 competency items were identified for inclusion in the questionnaire. A total of 63 early psychosis experts participated in 3 rating rounds. Of the 542 competency items, 242 were endorsed as the required core competencies. There were 29 competency items that were endorsed by 62 or more experts, and these may be considered the foundational competencies for early psychosis practice. The study generated a set of core competencies that provide a common language for early psychosis clinicians across professional disciplines and country of practice, and potentially are a useful professional resource to support early psychosis workforce development and service reform. \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.\n[DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nFeenstra, Maria Monberg; Kirkeby, Mette J\u00f8rgine; Thygesen, Marianne\n2018-01-01\nObjectives Breastfeeding problems are common and associated with early cessation.

Using primarily a cohort of 310 low-income boys of families recruited from Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition Supplement centers in a large metropolitan area followed from infancy to early adulthood and a smaller cohort of boys and girls followed through early childhood, we provide evidence supporting the critical role of parenting, maternal depression, and other proximal family risk factors in early childhood that are prospectively linked to trajectories of parent-reported conduct problems in early and middle childhood, youth-reported antisocial behavior during adolescence and early adulthood, and court-reported violent offending in adolescence. The findings are discussed in terms of the need to identify at-risk boys in early childhood and methods and platforms for engaging families in healthcare settings not previously used to implement preventive mental health services. \u00a9 2016 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.\n[A Case of Re-Expansion Pulmonary Edema after Rapid Pleural Evacuation](http://armaghanj.yums.ac.ir/browse.php?a_code=A-10-39-73&slc_lang=en&sid=1) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nSH Shahbazi\n2007-07-01\nFull Text Available Introduction & Objective: Pulmonary edema after chest tube insertion is a rare complication and is associated with high mortality. The cause of this phenomenon is not clear, although causes such as decrease in surfactant and inflammatory process have been defined. Early diagnosis and treatment decrease the mortality. This study introduces a case of re-expansion pulmonary edema after rapid pleural evacuation. Case: The case is a 4.5 y/o boy, a case of Tetralogy of Fallot, who developed respiratory distress after surgery (Total Correction in ICU of Namazi Hospital in 1385. Chest X ray showed pneumothorax of left lung. For the patient, chest tube was inserted and the symptoms improved.

A community sample of 117 early adolescent girls (M age=12.39years) provided DNA samples for 5-HTTLPR genotyping, and saliva samples for assessing cortisol 3 times a day (waking, 30min post-waking, and bedtime) over a three-day period. Latent trait cortisol (LTC) was modeled using the first 2 samples of each day. Early adversity was assessed with objective contextual stress interviews with adolescents and their mothers. A significant 5-HTTLPR\u00d7early adversity interaction indicated that greater early adversity was associated with lower LTC levels, but only among individuals with either L/L or S/L genotype. Findings suggest that serotonergic genetic variation may influence the impact of early adversity on individual differences in HPA-axis regulation. Future research should explore whether this interaction contributes to the development of psychopathology through HPA axis functioning. Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with Crohn's disease diagnosed between 1991 and 1997 and followed for at least 3 yr, who were identified in 16 community and referral-based practices in New England. Chart review was performed for each patient. Details of baseline demographic and disease features were recorded. Surgical history including date of surgery, indication, and procedure were also noted. Risk factors for early surgery (defined as major surgery for Crohn's disease within 3 yr of diagnosis, exclusive of major surgery at time of diagnosis) were identified by univariate analysis. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors. Of 345 eligible patients, 69 (20.1%) required surgery within 3 yr of diagnosis, excluding the 14 patients (4.1%) who had major surgery at the time of diagnosis. Overall, the interval between diagnosis and surgery was short; one half of all patients who required surgery underwent operation within 6 months of diagnosis. Risk factors identified by univariate analysis as significantly associated with early surgery included the following: smoking; disease of small bowel without colonic involvement; nausea and vomiting or abdominal pain on presentation; neutrophil count; and steroid use in the first 6 months. Disease localized to the colon only, blood in the stool, use of 5-aminosalicylate, and lymphocyte count were inversely associated with risk of early surgery. Logistic regression confirmed independent associations with smoking as a positive risk factor and involvement of colon without small bowel as a negative risk factor for early surgery. The rate of surgery is high in the first 3 yr after diagnosis of Crohn's disease, particularly in the first 6 months.

Glenn\n2018-04-01\nFull Text Available Children with early focal unilateral brain injury show remarkable plasticity in language development. However, little is known about how early brain injury influences mathematical learning. Here, we examine early number understanding, comparing cardinal number knowledge of typically developing children (TD and children with pre- and perinatal lesions (BI between 42 and 50 months of age. We also examine how this knowledge relates to the number words children hear from their primary caregivers early in life. We find that children with BI, are, on average, slightly behind TD children in both cardinal number knowledge and later mathematical performance, and show slightly slower learning rates than TD children in cardinal number knowledge during the preschool years. We also find that parents\u2019 \u201cnumber talk\u201d to their toddlers predicts later mathematical ability for both TD children and children with BI. These findings suggest a relatively optimistic story in which neural plasticity is at play in children\u2019s mathematical development following early brain injury. Further, the effects of early number input suggest that intervening to enrich the number talk that children with BI hear during the preschool years could narrow the math achievement gap.

Heaven Tree offers justifiable and zealous attempts to commemorate Yo\u0306m Sang-so\u0306p as a remarkable subject, one who was most acutely aware of the politics, society, and aesthetics of the period in which he lived. In addition, the twenty scrupulously researched and enlightening articles included in the collection unfold this attempt in a brilliant fashion, harking back to two earlier studies by Lee Bo-young and Kim Yun-sik. Those earlier books are the productive \u201cancestors\u201d of Heaven Tree, in that the depth and magnitude of their reconstruction and reevaluation of Yo\u0306m\u2019s thoughts are analogous to what is achieved in this new collection. Nonetheless, as much as Heaven Tree is similar to its ancestors in terms of the passion and meticulousness demonstrated by the contributing authors, it proves to be a courageous offspring, as the authors further absorb, complement, and renew the existing research...\n[Physical fitness and activity, metabolic profile, adipokines and endothelial function in children.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29856943)\nPenha, Jociene Terra da; Gazolla, Fernanda Mussi; Carvalho, Cec\u00edlia Noronha de Miranda; Madeira, Isabel Rey; Rodrigues-Junior, Fl\u00e1vio; Machado, Elisabeth de Amorim; Sicuro, Fernando Lencastre; Farinatti, Paulo; Bouskela, Eliete; Collett-Solberg, Paulo Ferrez\n2018-05-29\nThe prevalence of obesity is increasing. The aim of this study was to investigate if there is endothelial dysfunction in children with normal or excess weight, and whether the metabolic profile, adipokines, and endothelial dysfunction would be more strongly associated with physical fitness or with physical activity levels. Cross-sectional study involving children aged 5-12 years. The evaluation included venous occlusion plethysmography, serum levels of adiponectin, leptin and insulin, lipid profile, physical activity score (PAQ-C questionnaire), and physical fitness evaluation (Yo-Yo test). A total of 62 children participated in this study. Based on the body mass index, 27 were eutrophic, 10 overweight and 25 obese. Triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HOMA-IR, and leptin were higher in the obese and excess-weight groups compared to the eutrophic group (pPAQ-C. The Yo-Yo test was significantly associated with HDL cholesterol (rho=-0.41; p=0.01), and this association remained after adjusting for body mass index z-score (rho=0.28; p=0.03). This study showed that endothelial dysfunction is already present in obese children, suggesting a predisposition to atherosclerotic disease. Moreover, HDL cholesterol levels were correlated with physical fitness, regardless of body mass index. Copyright \u00a9 2018.

The basketball players were submitted to an intensified training period (OVL) followed by a tapering period (TP). Twenty-three young male basketball players initiated the study. Experimental criteria data were used to stratify 16 players into high-testosterone (HTC) or low-testosterone (LTC) concentration groups. All the 16 athletes undertook 5 weeks of OVL followed by a 3-week TP. Saliva sampling, Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 (Yo-Yo IRL1) test and the T-test were conducted at the beginning (T1), after OVL (T2), and after TP (T3). A similar increase in internal training load was observed during OVL when compared with TP in both groups (p 0.05); however, LTC displayed a higher score for fatigue (p 0.05). In conclusion, these results suggest that LTC athletes may be more susceptible to changes in mood states during intensified training periods. In addition, data indicate that a periodized training program successfully improved the physical performance (endurance and agility) of young basketball players; however, this improvement was not affected by testosterone level.\n[DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nNazerai, Loulieta; Bassi, Maria Rosaria; Uddb\u00e4ck, Ida Elin Maria\n2016-01-01\nIntracellular pathogens represent a serious threat during early life.

Their abundance was assessed by electrofishing. Most sites typically had 5.0-5.5 in pH, 0.4-0.7 mg L-1 Ca, 10-20 \u03bcg L-1 inorganic toxic aluminum (Ali) and acid-neutralizing capacity adjusted for organic acids (ANCOAA) of - 15 to +25 \u03bceq L-1. Densities of both YoY and older parr increased significantly during the study period. Water quality also improved in recent years with respect to pH (5.8-6.0), Ali (5-15 \u03bcg L-1) and ANCOAA (10-20 \u03bceq L-1). However, some negative trends in both fish density and water chemistry were found during both the first (1987-1993) and last years (2004-2008) of the study. Initially, YoY densities remained at about 16-20 specimens 100 m-2 (1987-1990), declined to 10-15 specimens 100 m-2 in the early/mid 1990s, and rosed to 30-50 specimens 100 m-2 in recent years (1997-2010). Their densities correlated significantly with ANCOAA, and at least three stages in the recovery process were recognised: (i) Low density with 10-20 specimens 100 m-2 at -18 to -5 \u03bceq L-1, (ii) medium and unstable density with 20-30 specimens 100 m-2 at -5 to 10 \u03bceq L-1, and (iii) increasing density to 40-50 specimens 100 m-2 at 10-25 \u03bceq L-1. The decline in brown trout density in the early-mid 1990s coincided with high sea salt depositions, which caused increased acidification. Component 1 in a PCA explained 51% of the variation in fish densities, including conductivity, Mg, Ca, Na, alkalinity and TOC. Component 2 explained an additional 31% of the variation, including pH, Ali and ANCOAA. Multiple regression analysis coefficients showed that the two components explained 41% of the variance in total fish density. Young brown trout suffered a high mortality during the initial phase of the study in spite of relative low levels of Ali.

However, there is a lack of knowledge about which early predictors could be used to identify (young) adolescents at risk for a disputed social status. The aim of this study was to assess whether preventive child health care (PCH) findings on early childhood predict neglected and rejected status in early adolescence in a large longitudinal community-based sample. Data came from 898 participants who participated in TRAILS, a longitudinal study. Information on early childhood factors was extracted from the charts of routine PCH visits registered between infancy and age of 4 years. To assess social status, peer nominations were used at age of 10-12 years. Multinomial logistic regression showed that children who had a low birth weight, motor problems, and sleep problems; children of parents with a low educational level (odds ratios [ORs] between 1.71 and 2.90); and those with fewer attention hyperactivity problems (ORs = .43) were more likely to have a neglected status in early adolescence. Boys, children of parents with a low educational level, and children with early externalizing problems were more likely to have a rejected status in early adolescence (ORs between 1.69 and 2.56). PCH findings on early childhood-on motor and social development-are predictive of a neglected and a rejected status in early adolescence. PCH is a good setting to monitor risk factors that predict the social status of young adolescents. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Its chronic course is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, making bipolar disorder one of the main causes of disability among young and working-age people. The implementation of early intervention strategies may help to change the outcome of the illness and avert potentially irreversible harm to patients with bipolar disorder, as early phases may be more responsive to treatment and may need less aggressive therapies. Early intervention in bipolar disorder is gaining momentum. Current evidence emerging from longitudinal studies indicates that parental early-onset bipolar disorder is the most consistent risk factor for bipolar disorder. Longitudinal studies also indicate that a full-blown manic episode is often preceded by a variety of prodromal symptoms, particularly subsyndromal manic symptoms, therefore supporting the existence of an at-risk state in bipolar disorder that could be targeted through early intervention. There are also identifiable risk factors that influence the course of bipolar disorder, some of them potentially modifiable. Valid biomarkers or diagnosis tools to help clinicians identify individuals at high risk of conversion to bipolar disorder are still lacking, although there are some promising early results. Pending more solid evidence on the best treatment strategy in early phases of bipolar disorder, physicians should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of each intervention. Further studies will provide the evidence needed to finish shaping the concept of early intervention.

Piaget refers to a level of moral development in action that precedes heteronomous and autonomous moral reasoning. This action level allows children to begin to interact with people and objects. In his later work, Piaget explores the gradual construction of understanding from this activity level. Taken together, these elements of Piagetian theory provide a promising conceptual framework for understanding the development of early helping.\n[Early Childhood Educators' Perceived and Actual Metalinguistic Knowledge, Beliefs and Enacted Practice about Teaching Early Reading](https://eric.ed.gov/?q=teaching+AND+teachers+AND+teaching+AND+reading&pg=5&id=EJ1086824)\nHammond, Lorraine\n2015-01-01\nResults of influential reports on early literacy have drawn attention to the need for early childhood educators to take up a more explicit, teacher-directed approach to beginning reading.

Furthermore, their genetic alterations, to our knowledge, have never been previously reported. We report the clinical as well as neuroimaging findings of four early cases of patients with GBM. In our series, early stage GBM occurred at a mean age of 57 years. All patients had seizures as their first symptom. In all early stages, MRI showed a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted sequences and an enhancement on GdE-T1WI sequences. A hyperintense signal on diffusion sequences with a low ADC value was also found. These early observed occurrences of GBM developed rapidly and presented the MRI characteristics of classic GBM within a few weeks. The GBM size was multiplied by 32 in one month. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated the de novo nature of these tumors, i.e. absence of mutant IDH1 R132H protein expression, which is a diagnostic marker of low-grade diffuse glioma and secondary GBM. A better knowledge of early GBM presentation would allow a more suitable management of the patients and may improve their prognosis. Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

MLA removes five or more walking legs, which are regenerated and become functional appendages at ecdysis. ESA eliminates the primary source of molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), which suppress the production of molting hormones (ecdysteroids) from the molting gland or Y-organ (YO). Both MLA and ESA are effective methods for molt induction in Gecarcinus lateralis. However, some G. lateralis individuals are refractory to MLA, as they fail to complete ecdysis by 12weeks post-MLA; these animals are in the \"blocked\" condition. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify mRNA levels of neuropeptide and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling genes in YO, eyestalk ganglia (ESG), thoracic ganglion (TG), and brain of intact and blocked animals. Six of the seven neuropeptide signaling genes, three of four mTOR signaling genes, and Gl-elongation factor 2 (EF2) mRNA levels were significantly higher in the ESG of blocked animals. Gl-MIH and Gl-CHH mRNA levels were higher in the TG and brain of blocked animals and levels increased in both control and blocked animals in response to ESA. By contrast, mRNA levels of Gl-EF2 and five of the 10 MIH signaling pathway genes in the YO were two to four orders of magnitude higher in blocked animals compared to controls. These data suggest that increased MIH and CHH synthesis in the ESG contributes to the prevention of molt induction by MLA in blocked animals. The up-regulation of MIH signaling genes in the YO of blocked animals suggests that the YO is more sensitive to MIH produced in the ESG, as well as MIH produced in brain and TG of ESA animals. Both the up-regulation of MIH signaling genes in the YO and of Gl-MIH and Gl-CHH in the ESG, TG, and brain appear to contribute to some G. lateralis individuals being refractory to MLA and ESA.

However, little is known about how early brain injury influences mathematical learning. Here, we examine early number understanding, comparing cardinal number knowledge of typically developing children (TD) and children with pre- and perinatal lesions (BI) between 42 and 50 months of age. We also examine how this knowledge relates to the number words children hear from their primary caregivers early in life. We find that children with BI, are, on average, slightly behind TD children in both cardinal number knowledge and later mathematical performance, and show slightly slower learning rates than TD children in cardinal number knowledge during the preschool years. We also find that parents' \"number talk\" to their toddlers predicts later mathematical ability for both TD children and children with BI. These findings suggest a relatively optimistic story in which neural plasticity is at play in children's mathematical development following early brain injury. Further, the effects of early number input suggest that intervening to enrich the number talk that children with BI hear during the preschool years could narrow the math achievement gap.

The early variety was 0.73%, the mid variety was 1.51%, and the late variety was 1.97%. The percentage of homologous series of early mutants from the varieties with the same pedigree and relationship were similar, but the one from the cog nation were lower than those from distant varieties. There are basic laws and characters in the homologous series of early mutants: 1. The inhibited phenotype is the basic of the homologous series of early mutants; 2. The production of the homologous series of early mutants is closely related with the growing period of the parent; 3. The parallel mutation of the stem and leaves are simultaneously happened with the variation of early or late maturing; 4. The occurrence of the homologous series of early mutants is in a state of imbalance. According to the law of parallel variability, the production of homologous series of early mutants can be predicted as long as the parents' classification of plant, pedigree and ecological type are identified. Therefore, the early breeding can be guided by the law of homologous series of early mutants\n[Effect of Half Time Cooling on Thermoregulatory Responses and Soccer-Specific Performance Tests](https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=dedup_wf_001::34e93ea7a2bbea80d83c56ad85b121d9)\nYang Zhang; Svetlana Nepocatych; Charlie P.

Although genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of such disorders, the neurobiological mechanisms involved are poorly understood. A reliable mouse model of early life adversity leading to lasting behavioral changes would facilitate progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these adverse effects. Maternal separation is a commonly used model of early life neglect, but has led to inconsistent results in the mouse. Results In an effort to develop a mouse model of early life neglect with long-lasting behavioral effects in C57BL/6 mice, we designed a new maternal separation paradigm that we call Maternal Separation with Early Weaning (MSEW. We tested the effects of MSEW on C57BL/6 mice as well as the genetically distinct DBA/2 strain and found significant MSEW effects on several behavioral tasks (i.e., the open field, elevated plus maze, and forced swim test when assessed more than two months following the MSEW procedure. Our findings are consistent with MSEW causing effects within multiple behavioral domains in both strains, and suggest increased anxiety, hyperactivity, and behavioral despair in the MSEW offspring. Analysis of pup weights and metabolic parameters showed no evidence for malnutrition in the MSEW pups. Additionally, strain differences in many of the behavioral tests suggest a role for genetic factors in the response to early life neglect. Conclusions These results suggest that MSEW may serve as a useful model to examine the complex behavioral abnormalities often apparent in individuals with histories of early life neglect, and may lead to greater understanding of these later life outcomes and offer insight into novel therapeutic strategies.\n[\u00abQue tambi\u00e9n s\u00e9 yo hacer bailes\u00bb: Lope de Vega and the dramatic dance](http://xn--revistadefilologiaespaola-uoc.revistas.csic.es/index.php/rfe/article/view/249) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nFrancisco S\u00e1ez Raposo\n2012-12-01\nFull Text Available This paper analyzes the significance and consequences of Lope de Vega\u2019s status as a legend when it comes to accepting his authorship of a few short plays, given that critics tend to demand extra proof in this matter, sometimes going beyond reasonable philological demands.

We revisited 152 Peruvian children who participated in a birth cohort study between 1995 and 1998, and obtained anthropometric and bioimpedance measurements 11 to 14 years later. We used multivariable regression models to study the effects of childhood anthropometric indices on height and body composition in early adolescence. Each standard deviation decrease in length-for-age at birth was associated with a decrease in adolescent height-for-age of 0.7 SD in both boys and girls (all poverweight in early adolescence. Linear growth retardation in early childhood is a strong determinant of adolescent stature, indicating that, in developing countries, growth failure in height during early childhood persists through early adolescence. Interventions addressing linear growth retardation in childhood are likely to improve adolescent stature and related-health outcomes in adulthood.

Does this diagnostic distinction have any meaningful clinical implications? In this edition of The Interface, we present empirical studies that have, within a single study, compared individuals with early-versus late-onset dysthymia. In this review, we found that, compared to those with late-onset dysthymia, early-onset patients are more likely to harbor psychiatric comorbidity both on Axis I and II, exhibit less psychological resilience, and have more prominent family loadings for mood disorders. These findings suggest that this distinction is meaningful and that the early-onset subtype of dysthymia is more difficult to effectively treat.

The literature is replete with reports of deleterious effects on developmental outcome, cognitive function, and school performance in children and youth. Causative factors include poor nutrition, exposure to toxins, inadequate parenting, lack of cognitive stimulation, unstable social support, genetics, and toxic environments. Less is known regarding how early in life adverse effects may be detected. This review proposes to elucidate \"how early is early\" through discussion of seminal articles related to the effect of socioeconomic status on language outcome and a discussion of the emerging literature on effects of socioeconomic status disparity on brain structure in very young children. Given the young ages at which such outcomes are detected, the critical need for early targeted interventions for our youngest is underscored. Further, the fiscal reasonableness of initiating quality interventions supports these initiatives. As early life adversity produces lasting and deleterious effects on developmental outcome and brain structure, increased focus on programs and policies directed to reducing the impact of socioeconomic disparities is essential.\n[Predicting Readmission at Early Hospitalization Using Electronic Clinical Data: An Early Readmission Risk Score.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27755391)\nTabak, Ying P; Sun, Xiaowu; Nunez, Carlos M; Gupta, Vikas; Johannes, Richard S\n2017-03-01\nIdentifying patients at high risk for readmission early during hospitalization may aid efforts in reducing readmissions. We sought to develop an early readmission risk predictive model using automated clinical data available at hospital admission. We developed an early readmission risk model using a derivation cohort and validated the model with a validation cohort. We used a published Acute Laboratory Risk of Mortality Score as an aggregated measure of clinical severity at admission and the number of hospital discharges in the previous 90 days as a measure of disease progression. We then evaluated the administrative data-enhanced model by adding principal and secondary diagnoses and other variables. We examined the c-statistic change when additional variables were added to the model. There were 1,195,640 adult discharges from 70 hospitals with 39.8% male and the median age of 63 years (first and third quartile: 43, 78). The 30-day readmission rate was 11.9% (n=142,211). The early readmission model yielded a graded relationship of readmission and the Acute Laboratory Risk of Mortality Score and the number of previous discharges within 90 days. The model c-statistic was 0.697 with good calibration. When administrative variables were added to the model, the c-statistic increased to 0.722. Automated clinical data can generate a readmission risk score early at hospitalization with fair discrimination. It may have applied value to aid early care transition. Adding administrative data increases predictive accuracy. The administrative data-enhanced model may be used for hospital comparison and outcome research.\n[Early College for All: Efforts to Scale up Early Colleges in Multiple Settings](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED566988.pdf)\nEdmunds, Julie A.\n2016-01-01\nGiven the positive impacts of the small, stand-alone early college model and the desire to provide those benefits to more students, organizations have begun efforts to scale up the early college model in a variety of settings.

To assess elderly injury risk, age-specific computational models can be developed to directly calculate biomechanical metrics for injury. The first objective was to develop an older occupant Global Human Body Models Consortium (GHBMC) average male model (M50) representative of a 65 year old (YO) and to perform regional validation tests to investigate predicted fractures and injury severity with age. Development of the GHBMC M50 65 YO model involved implementing geometric, cortical thickness, and material property changes with age. Regional validation tests included a chest impact, a lateral impact, a shoulder impact, a thoracoabdominal impact, an abdominal bar impact, a pelvic impact, and a lateral sled test. The second objective was to investigate age-related injury risks by performing a frontal US NCAP simulation test with the GHBMC M50 65 YO and the GHBMC M50 v4.2 models. Simulation results were compared to the GHBMC M50 v4.2 to evaluate the effect of age on occupant response and risk for head injury, neck injury, thoracic injury, and lower extremity injury. Overall, the GHBMC M50 65 YO model predicted higher probabilities of AIS 3+ injury for the head and thorax.\n[The basic benefit package: composition and exceptions to the rules. A case study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25680945)\nKroneman, Madelon; de Jong, Judith D\n2015-03-01\nWith the introduction of the Health Insurance Act in 2006 in the Netherlands, the basic package of the former sickness funds became valid for all citizens. The basic benefit package has been subject to change, responding to increasing health care expenditures, medical innovations and the economic crisis. In this paper we address the decision criteria used to assess the package annually since 2006 and describe some developments that do not follow the criteria, leading to a yo-yo effect. We discuss the formation of the decision for in- or exclusion and why some treatments seem to follow an, at first sight, arbitrary in- and exclusion pathway. We first describe the official way of establishing the basic benefit package and than will describe why some treatments follow a deviated path. We conclude that political pressure and pressure from interest groups may lead to inclusion or postponement of exclusion. Reform of the organization of certain forms of health care (in our example mental care) may lead to seemingly inconsequent changes. The yo-yo effect of some treatments or pharmaceuticals may have negative effects on health care providers, insurers and patients. The seemingly well defined criteria available for defining the basic package appear to be broadly interpretable and other influences may determine the final decision of inclusion or exclusion.

Laura; Reigada, Ramon\n2012-01-01\nDimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been known to enhance cell membrane permeability of drugs or DNA. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with single-component lipid bilayers predicted the existence of three regimes of action of DMSO: membrane loosening, pore formation and bilayer collapse. We show here that these modes of action are also reproduced in the presence of cholesterol in the bilayer, and we provide a description at the atomic detail of the DMSO-mediated process of pore formation in cholesterol-containing lipid membranes. We also successfully explore the applicability of DMSO to promote plasma membrane permeability to water, calcium ions (Ca2+) and Yo-Pro-1 iodide (Yo-Pro-1) in living cell membranes. The experimental results on cells in culture can be easily explained according to the three expected regimes: in the presence of low doses of DMSO, the membrane of the cells exhibits undulations but no permeability increase can be detected, while at intermediate DMSO concentrations cells are permeabilized to water and calcium but not to larger molecules as Yo-Pro-1. These two behaviors can be associated to the MD-predicted consequences of the effects of the DMSO at low and intermediate DMSO concentrations. At larger DMSO concentrations, permeabilization is larger, as even Yo-Pro-1 can enter the cells as predicted by the DMSO-induced membrane-destructuring effects described in the MD simulations.

To provide measures of time perspective, young (YA; M = 22.48 years), young-old (YO; M = 67.56 years), old-old adults (OO; M = 80.24 years), and participants with moderate severity Alzheimer's disease (PAD; M = 84.28 years) completed a line task and reported subjective age. As expected, YA, YO, and OO reported successively more constrained future time perspectives. PAD showed distortion in time perspective, envisioning a future comparable with the YO, although closer matched in chronological age to OO adults. To evince positivity effects, participants were oriented to pairs of emotional images and were then tested for memory (recall and recognition) of the images. Recall and recognition memory for the images indicated an age-related advantage for positive over negative material (positivity effects). Time perspective, however, did not moderate these age effects. In memory performance, PAD were more comparable with OO adults with whom they shared a similar chronological age, rather than YO adults, who had a corresponding time perspective. These results suggest that age correlates that are shared by PAD and OO, such as reduced processing resources, rather than time perspective, may drive the age associated positivity effects.

In the middle of the regular season, 129 players from four different Divisions completed a Yo-YoIR1 and, after 3-to-8 days, they performed a 6-min continuous running test (Mognoni's test), a counter-movement jump (CMJ) test and a 5-min High-intensity Intermittent running test (HIT). Magnitude-based inferences revealed that differences in HIT were very likely moderate between Division I and II and likely small between Division II and III. The differences in absolute peak power and force produced during CMJs between Division I and II and between Division II and III were possibly small. Differences in Yo-YoIR1 and Mognoni's test were very likely-to-almost certain moderate/large between Division III and VI. We observed possibly-to-likely small differences in HIT and Mognoni's test between guards and forwards and almost certainly moderate differences in absolute peak power and force during CMJs between guards and centres. The ability to sustain high-intensity intermittent efforts (i.e. HIT) and strength/power characteristics can differentiate between competitive level, while strength/power characteristics discriminate guards from forwards/centres. These findings inform practitioners on the development of identification programs and training activities in basketball.\n[Long-term Consequences of Early Parenthood](https://pure.au.dk/ws/files/125836691/wp18_01.pdf) [DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nJohansen, Eva Rye; Nielsen, Helena Skyt; Verner, Mette\n(and to lesser extent employment), as fathers appear to support the family, especially when early parenthood is combined with cohabitation with the mother and the child.

We therefore examined the association in a population based cohort study. We identified 5909 stroke patients who were admitted to stroke units in a Danish county between 2005 and 2010.The examined recommended processes of care included early admission to a stroke unit, early initiation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, early computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) scan, early physiotherapy and occupational therapy, early assessment of nutritional risk, constipation risk and of swallowing function, early mobilization,early catheterization, and early thromboembolism prophylaxis.Hospital costs were assessed for each patient based on the number of days spent in different in-hospital facilities using local hospital charges. The mean costs of hospitalization were $23 352 (standard deviation 27 827). The relationship between receiving more relevant processes of early stroke care and lower hospital costs followed a dose\u2013response relationship. The adjusted costs were $24 566 (95% confidence interval 19 364\u201329 769) lower for patients who received 75\u2013100% of the relevant processes of care compared with patients receiving 0\u201324%. All processes of care were associated with potential cost savings, except for early catheterization and early thromboembolism prophylaxis. Early care in agreement with key guidelines recommendations for the management of patients with stroke may be associated with hospital savings.\n[Ultrasonographic findings of early abortion: suggested predictors](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=39119413) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nJun, Soon Ae; Ahn, Myoung Ock; Cha, Kwang Yul; Lee, Young Doo\n1992-01-01\nTo investigate predictable ultrasonographic findings of early abortion. To investigate objective rules for the screening of abortion. Ultrasonographic examination of 111 early pregnancies between the sixth and ninth week in women who had regular 28 day menstrual cycles was performed. Ultrasonographic measurements of the gestational sac, crown rump length and fetal heart rate were performed using a linear array real time transducer with doppler ultrasonogram. All measurements of 17 early abortions were compared to those of 94 normal pregnancies. Most of early aborted pregnancies were classified correctly by discriminant analysis with G-SAC and CRL (G-SAC=0.5 CRL + 15, sensitivity 76.5%, specificity 96.8%). With the addition of FHR, 94.1% of early abortions could be predicted. In conclusion, ultrasonographic findings of early intrauterine growth retardation, small gestational sac and bradycardia can be predictable signs suggestive of poor prognosis of early pregnancies\n[[Autism: An early neurodevelopmental disorder].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28256376)\nBonnet-Brilhault, F\n2017-04-01\nWith approximately 67 million individuals affected worldwide, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the fastest growing neurodevelopmental disorder (United Nations, 2011), with a prevalence estimated to be 1/100. In France ASD affects approximately 600,000 individuals (from childhood to adulthood, half of whom are also mentally retarded), who thus have a major handicap in communication and in adapting to daily life, which leads autism to be recognized as a national public health priority. ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects several domains (i.e., socio-emotional, language, sensori-motor, executive functioning). These disorders are expressed early in life with an age of onset around 18 months. Despite evidence suggesting a strong genetic link with ASD, the genetic determinant remains unclear. The clinical picture is characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication and the presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviors (DSM-5, ICD-10). However, in addition to these two main dimensions there is significant comorbidity between ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or with genetic and medical conditions. One of the diagnostic features of ASD is its early emergence: symptoms must begin in early childhood for a diagnosis to be given. Due to brain plasticity, early interventions are essential to facilitate clinical improvement. Therefore, general practitioners and pediatricians are on the front line to detect early signs of ASD and to guide both medical explorations and early rehabilitation.

The present study resolves these large discrepancies by analyzing several case studies of sprite and narrowband VLF observations, in which multiple transmitter-receiver VLF links with great circle paths (GCPs) passing near a sprite-producing thunderstorm were available. In this setup, the multiple links act in a complementary way that makes the detection of early VLF perturbations much more probable compared to a single VLF link that can miss several of them, a fact that was overlooked in past studies. The evidence shows that sprites are accompanied by early VLF perturbations in a one-to-one correspondence. This implies that the sprite generation mechanism may cause also sub-ionospheric conductivity disturbances that produce early VLF events. However, the one-to-one \"sprite to early\" event relationship, if viewed conversely as \"early to sprite\", appears not to be always reciprocal. This is because the number of early events detected in some cases was considerably larger than the number of sprites. Since the great majority of the early events not accompanied by sprites was caused by positive cloud to ground (+CG) lightning discharges, it is possible that sprites or sprite halos were concurrently present in these events as well but were missed by the sprite-watch detection system. In order for this option to be resolved we need more studies using highly sensitive optical systems capable of detecting weaker sprites, sprite halos and elves.\n[Sexualidad en el periodo gestacional](https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=od______1700::e27d3c4af932378f3e617226252d8b5f)\nGarc\u00eda Romero, Mar\u00eda\n2014-01-01\nEscasos son los estudios que investigan la actividad sexual durante el per\u00edodo gestacional, y que plantean posibles soluciones para paliar los problemas y/o mejorar los conocimientos que tengan los futuros padres.

METHOD: exploratory and descriptive study undertaken in a university hospital in the South of Brazil. Fifteen women who had recently given birth, who received a consultation with the nurse in the period August - October 2011, took part in the study. Data was collected after the consultation had finished through semi-structured interviews, in which the women who had recently given birth were asked about the return to sexual activity and the feelings involved in this process. RESULTS: the principal determinant/constraint for return to sexual activity in the post-natal period was the fear of a new pregnancy. Fear of feeling pain, permission from the health professional, shame of their own bodies and changes in libido emerged as constraining and/or determinant factors in the thematic analysis. CONCLUSION: it is considered fundamental for the issue of contraception to be addressed with the woman/couple during the pre-natal consultation, so that there may be opportunities for reflection and dialog prior to the critical time itself.

Our purpose was to investigate the diagnostic value of single and serial measurement of EPF, especially in the differential diagnosis of abortion and extrauterine pregnancy. Women with a history of 6-16 weeks amenorrhoea with/without vaginal bleeding were included in the prospective study. The EPF-test system was carried out by means of the rosette inhibition method. EPF proved to be always positive in normal pregnant women and always negative in nonpregnant controls. In case of threatened abortion the prognosis was good, when the EPF values were positive, and poor when they became negative. Patients suffering from spontaneous and missed abortion mostly showed negative EPF-values. This was also true in ectopic pregnancies. The sensitivity and specificity of EPF-test system were 83%. The positive predictive value was observed to be 54% and the negative predictive value 95%. The EPF as an early embryonic signal may be a suitable parameter for the clinical use detecting pregnancy disturbances very early.\n[Capturing early signs of deterioration: the dutch-early-nurse-worry-indicator-score and its value in the Rapid Response System](https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F177311/uquery/trigger%20AND%20warning/id/1/Language/EN)\nDouw, G.; Huisman-de Waal, G.J.; Zanten, A.R. van; Hoeven, J.G. van der; Schoonhoven, L.\n2017-01-01\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the predictive value of individual and combined dutch-early-nurse-worry-indicator-score indicators at various Early Warning Score levels, differentiating between Early Warning Scores reaching the trigger threshold to call a rapid response team and Early Warning\n[Marital conflict and early adolescents' self-evaluation: the role of parenting quality and early adolescents' appraisals.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21811886)\nSiffert, Andrea; Schwarz, Beate; Stutz, Melanie\n2012-06-01\nCognitive appraisals and family dynamics have been identified as mediators of the relationship between marital conflict and children's adjustment. Surprisingly little research has investigated both meditational processes in the same study. Guided by the cognitive-contextual framework and the spillover hypothesis, the present study integrated factors from both theories early adolescents' appraisals of threat and self-blame, as well as perceived parenting quality as mediators of the link between early adolescents' perception of marital conflict and their self-evaluations (self-esteem and scholastic competence). Analyses were based on the first two waves of an ongoing longitudinal study. Participants were 176 two-parent families, and their early adolescents (50.5% girls) whose mean age was 10.61 years at Time 1 (SD =0.40) and 11.63 years at Time 2 (SD=0.39). Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that parenting quality and early adolescents' perceived threat provided indirect pathways between marital conflict and early adolescents' self-esteem 1 year later when controlling for their initial level of self-esteem. With respect to scholastic competence, only fathers' parenting was an indirect link. Self-blame did not play a role. Implications for understanding the mechanisms by which exposure to marital conflict predicts early adolescents' maladjustment are discussed.\n[Anti-neuronal anti-bodies in patients with early psychosis.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28461116)\nMantere, O; Saarela, M; Kiesepp\u00e4, T; Raij, T; M\u00e4ntyl\u00e4, T; Lindgren, M; Rikandi, E; Stoecker, W; Teegen, B; Suvisaari, J\n2018-02-01\nIt may be challenging to distinguish autoimmune encephalitis associated with anti-neuronal autoantibodies from primary psychiatric disorders.

Dutch-early-nurse-worry-indicator-score comprises nine indicators underlying nurses' 'worry' about a patient's condition. All indicators independently show significant association with unplanned intensive care/high dependency unit admission or unexpected mortality. Prediction of this outcome improved by adding the dutch-early-nurse-worry-indicator-score indicators to an Early Warning Score based on vital signs. An observational cohort study was conducted on three surgical wards in a tertiary university-affiliated teaching hospital. Included were surgical, native-speaking, adult patients. Nurses scored presence of 'worry' and/or dutch-early-nurse-worry-indicator-score indicators every shift or when worried. Vital signs were measured according to the prevailing protocol. Unplanned intensive care/high dependency unit admission or unexpected mortality was the composite endpoint. Percentages of 'worry' and dutch-early-nurse-worry-indicator-score indicators were calculated at various Early Warning Score levels in control and event groups. Entering all dutch-early-nurse-worry-indicator-score indicators in a multiple logistic regression analysis, we calculated a weighted score and calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predicted value and negative predicted value for each possible total score. In 3522 patients, 102 (2\u00b79%) had an unplanned intensive care/high dependency unit admissions (n = 97) or unexpected mortality (n = 5).

The Bucharest Early Intervention Project is a unique randomized controlled trial of foster care placement compared with continued care in institutions. As a result of the study design, participants were exposed to a quantified range of time in institutional care, and represented an ideal population in which to examine the association between a specific early adversity, institutional care and telomere length. We examined the association between average relative telomere length, telomere repeat copy number to single gene copy number (T/S) ratio and exposure to institutional care quantified as the percent of time at baseline (mean age 22 months) and at 54 months of age that each child lived in the institution. A significant negative correlation between T/S ratio and percentage of time was observed. Children with greater exposure to institutional care had significantly shorter relative telomere length in middle childhood. Gender modified this main effect. The percentage of time in institutional care at baseline significantly predicted telomere length in females, whereas the percentage of institutional care at 54 months was strongly predictive of telomere length in males. This is the first study to demonstrate an association between telomere length and institutionalization, the first study to find an association between adversity and telomere length in children, and contributes to the growing literature linking telomere length and early adversity.

However, even for evidence-based couple therapies, effectiveness is weaker compared to controlled studies, maybe because many Veteran couples drop out early and do not reach the \"active\" treatment stage after the 3-4 session assessment. In order to improve outcomes, it is critical to identify couples at high risk for early dropout, and understand whether couples may benefit from the assessment as an intervention. The current study examined (a) demographics, treatment delivery mode, relationship satisfaction, and psychological symptoms as predictors of dropout during and immediately following the assessment phase, and (b) changes in relationship satisfaction during assessment. 174 couples completed questionnaires during routine intake procedures. The main analyses focused on 140 male Veterans and their female civilian partners; 36.43% dropped out during the assessment phase and 24.74% of the remaining couples immediately following the first treatment session. More severe depressive symptoms in non-Veteran partners were associated with dropout during assessment. Relationship satisfaction improved significantly during the assessment phase for couples who did not drop out, with larger gains for non-Veteran partners. No demographics or treatment delivery mode were associated with dropout. Although more research is needed on engaging couples at risk for early dropout and maximizing early benefits, the findings suggest that clinicians should attend to the civilian partner's and Veteran's depressive symptoms at intake and consider the assessment part of active treatment. \u00a9 2017 Family Process Institute.\n[Synthesis of IES Research on Early Intervention and Early Childhood Education.

Integral to this is the 'Cambrian explosion', which records the rapid emergence of most animal phyla, and for which the triggering and accelerating factors, whether environmental or biological, are still unclear. Here we describe exceptionally well-preserved complex digestive organs in early arthropods from the early Cambrian of China and Greenland with functional similarities to certain modern crustaceans and trace these structures through the early evolutionary lineage of fossil arthropods. These digestive structures are assumed to have allowed for more efficient digestion and metabolism, promoting carnivory and macrophagy in early arthropods via predation or scavenging. This key innovation may have been of critical importance in the radiation and ecological success of Arthropoda, which has been the most diverse and abundant invertebrate phylum since the Cambrian.\n[Children\u2019s early helping in action: Piagetian developmental theory and early prosocial behavior](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4102168)\nHammond, Stuart I.\n2014-01-01\nAfter a brief overview of recent research on early helping, outlining some central problems, and issues, this paper examines children\u2019s early helping through the lens of Piagetian moral and developmental theory, drawing on Piaget\u2019s \u201cMoral Judgment of the Child\u201d (Piaget, 1932/1997), \u201cPlay, Dreams, and Imitation in Childhood\u201d (Piaget, 1945/1951), and the \u201cGrasp of Consciousness\u201d (Piaget, 1976). Piaget refers to a level of moral development in action that precedes heteronomous and autonomous moral reasoning. This action level allows children to begin to interact with people and objects. In his later work, Piaget explores the gradual construction of understanding from this activity level. Taken together, these elements of Piagetian theory provide a promising conceptual framework for understanding the development of early helping.

In the early 1980s, Treisman proposed the feature integration theory of attention (FIT, based on the findings of neuroscience. Soon after publishing her theory a new scientific approach appeared investigating several visual perception phenomena. The most widely researched were the key constructs of FIT, like types of visual search and the role of the attention.

Telomerase activity is high in male germ line and stem cells, but is low or absent in mature oocytes and cleavage stage embryos, and then high again in blastocysts. How early embryos reset telomere length remains poorly understood. Here, we show that oocytes actually have shorter telomeres than somatic cells, but their telomeres lengthen remarkably during early cleavage development. Moreover, parthenogenetically activated oocytes also lengthen their telomeres, thus the capacity to elongate telomeres must reside within oocytes themselves. Notably, telomeres also elongate in the early cleavage embryos of telomerase-null mice, demonstrating that telomerase is unlikely to be responsible for the abrupt lengthening of telomeres in these cells. Coincident with telomere lengthening, extensive telomere sister-chromatid exchange (T-SCE) and colocalization of the DNA recombination proteins Rad50 and TRF1 were observed in early cleavage embryos. Both T-SCE and DNA recombination proteins decrease in blastocyst stage embryos, whereas telomerase activity increases and telomeres elongate only slowly. We suggest that telomeres lengthen during the early cleavage cycles following fertilization through a recombination-based mechanism, and that from the blastocyst stage onwards, telomerase only maintains the telomere length established by this alternative mechanism.\n[Early Intervention in Psychosis](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4414340)\nMcGorry, Patrick D.\n2015-01-01\nAbstract Early intervention for potentially serious disorder is a fundamental feature of healthcare across the spectrum of physical illness. It has been a major factor in the reductions in morbidity and mortality that have been achieved in some of the non-communicable diseases, notably cancer and cardiovascular disease. Over the past two decades, an international collaborative effort has been mounted to build the evidence and the capacity for early intervention in the psychotic disorders, notably schizophrenia, where for so long deep pessimism had reigned. The origins and rapid development of early intervention in psychosis are described from a personal and Australian perspective. This uniquely evidence-informed, evidence-building and cost-effective reform provides a blueprint and launch pad to radically change the wider landscape of mental health care and dissolve many of the barriers that have constrained progress for so long.

The most critical point for best prognosis is to identify early-stage cancer cells. Investigators have studied many breast diagnostic approaches, including mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, computerized tomography, positron emission tomography and biopsy. However, these techniques have some limitations such as being expensive, time consuming and not suitable for young women. Developing a high-sensitive and rapid early-stage breast cancer diagnostic method is urgent. In recent years, investigators have paid their attention in the development of biosensors to detect breast cancer using different biomarkers. Apart from biosensors and biomarkers, microwave imaging techniques have also been intensely studied as a promising diagnostic tool for rapid and cost-effective early-stage breast cancer detection. This paper aims to provide an overview on recent important achievements in breast screening methods (particularly on microwave imaging) and breast biomarkers along with biosensors for rapidly diagnosing breast cancer.\n[The Foreign Policy of Venezuela Toward El Salvador: 1979-1983](http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA227701)\n1990-06-01\nvista extra-regional, la \"zona vital\" es rica en materiales estrat~gicos, tales como el petr6leo, el hierro, y el aluminlo.

Early detection is the key to improving survival in PC. Addressing this urgent need, the Kenner Family Research Fund conducted the inaugural Early Detection of Sporadic Pancreatic Cancer Summit Conference in 2014 in conjunction with the 45th Anniversary Meeting of the American Pancreatic Association and Japan Pancreas Society. This seminal convening of international representatives from science, practice, and clinical research was designed to facilitate challenging interdisciplinary conversations to generate innovative ideas leading to the creation of a defined collaborative strategic pathway for the future of the field. An in-depth summary of current efforts in the field, analysis of gaps in specific areas of expertise, and challenges that exist in early detection is presented within distinct areas of inquiry: Case for Early Detection: Definitions, Detection, Survival, and Challenges; Biomarkers for Early Detection; Imaging; and Collaborative Studies. In addition, an overview of efforts in familial PC is presented in an addendum to this article. It is clear from the summit deliberations that only strategically designed collaboration among investigators, institutions, and funders will lead to significant progress in early detection of sporadic PC.

At 20 \u00b1 2.5 months of age, 5.6% of children exhibited caries defined as one or more demineralized or cavitated lesions on the upper incisors. Of the mothers, 52.2% had no paid employment, 39.6% were part-time and 8.2% full-time employed. Overall, mothers' participation in the workforce had no influence on the frequency of severe early childhood caries in their child, but there was a significant interaction with family structure. For mothers without employment there was no difference between single, and two-parent families, but children with an employed single mother more frequently had caries than those with a working mother in a two-parent family (P early childhood caries in their child.\n[Early Childhood Inclusion in Spain](https://eric.ed.gov/?q=inclusion&pg=4&id=EJ1103440)\nGin\u00e9, Climent; Balcells-Balcells, Anna; Ca\u00f1adas, Margarita; Paniagua, Gema\n2016-01-01\nThis article describes early childhood inclusion in educational settings in Spain.

The most adequate cells for obtaining the thermodynamic data in a fast and accurate way was determined. This experimental set-up can also be used for indirect measurements in gases and liquids. Results of the measurements of the electromotive force versus temperature, performed for different samples, having an O/Fe ratio from 1.049 to 1.124 are given. From the experimental data, the following information was obtained: partial molar quantities corresponding to both Fe and O (enthalpy \u0394H; entropy \u0394S, and free energy \u0394G). The oxide's phase boundaries between 600 and 1050 deg C were determined, showing the existence of a subphase within the range of stability of Fesub(1-y)O. The development of a theoretical model allowed to make a semiquantitative fit of the enthalpies of formation and to advance in the knowledge on the defect structure of this oxided system. According to certain theories, the wuestite, whose crystalline structure is of the NaCl type, with O in excess leads to the formation of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) of spinel structure, this being the main agent causing the corrosion processes in the primary and secondary circuits of the nuclear reactors. Owing to the fact that the wuestite is similar to other transition metal oxides, such as NiO; CoO and MnO, this model may be also applied to these oxides. (M.E.L.)

In this study, we examined variation in body size, functional capacities and motivation for achievement, competitiveness and deliberate practice of youth basketball players associated with differences in biological maturity status, chronological age and years of training experience. Reflecting the importance of interactive effects, we examined the relationships between the psychological variables and functional capacities. Fifty-eight male basketball players aged 9.5 to 15.5 years were considered. Variables included chronological age, estimated age at peak height velocity, stature, body mass and sitting height by anthropometry; the Work and Family Orientation and Deliberate Practice Motivation Questionnaires were also used. Finally, the Line Drill test and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) tests were used as functional capacities indicators for basketball. Variance components models derived from series of multilevel linear regression models revealed a substantial variation by maturity status for body size, functional capacities indicators, mastery and will to excel. The influence of estimated maturity status on mastery and will to excel was independent of age and years of experience. In contrast, no relationships were observed between psychological variables and functional capacities indicators. We conclude that growth-related changes are relevant to understanding players\u00b4 motivations for achievement, competitiveness and deliberate practice.

The exact etiological pathways of bipolar disorder are not fully understood. Genetic factors are known to play an important role in the etiology of bipolar disorder. However, high rates of discordance among identical twins and a growing body of evidence that environmental factors such as early stress can influence the onset and course of psychiatric diseases underline the importance of additional etiological mechanisms of bipolar disorders. There has been little investigation about early trauma in bipolar disorder. The aim of this study was to review the literature on the association between early traumatic interactions like child neglect, mistreatment, abuse or early parental separation and the occurrence of bipolar disorder in adulthood or impact on the course of the disease. Studies investigating associations between child neglect, mistreatment, abuse or early parental separation and occurrence of bipolar disorder in adulthood or impact on the course of the disease were searched in the Pubmed database. More than 700 articles were sorted independently by two of the authors using predefined criteria. Only research articles, reviews and meta-analyses were selected for this review. 53 articles met the inclusion criteria. To date, four systematic reviews partially addressed our research question. Early trauma is more frequently found in the past of bipolar patients than in the general population. Studies support a harmful effect of childhood trauma on the course of bipolar disease, with more anxious, depressive or psychotic symptoms, an early age of onset and a worse prognosis.

The anti-fertility efficiency of the combined treatment was more effective than that of the He-Ne laser or the HPD treatment alone. The fluorescence spectrum of HPD determined by PNQ3 showed that its affinity to embryonic tissue was about 4 times greater than that to uterine tissue. This may underlie the mechanisms of anti-early pregnancy of the laser. The operation of artificial abortion is a routine method to terminate early pregnancy. Though it is simple and easy, its syndrome and complications can not be absolutely avoided. Many antifertility drugs have been reported, however, they often bring in general reaction. Our present work is to explore a new way of anti-early pregnancy in rabbits by means of the light inhibitory and light sensitive effects of laser. It is a quite safe and painless treatment without expanding and scraping of the uterus.\n[International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nBergeron, C.\n2004-01-01\n'Full text:' Early stage venture funding requires an in depth understanding of both current and future markets as well as the key technical hurdles that need to be overcome for new technology to commercialize into successful products for mass markets.

Explanations for the therapeutic mechanisms in music have almost always included cultural and social science-based causalities about the uses and functions of music in society. However, it is also important to note that the view of music as \"therapy\" was also always strongly influenced by the view and understanding of the concepts and causes of disease. Magical/mystical concepts of illness and \"rational\" medicine probably lived side by side for thousands of years. Not until the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries were the scientific foundations of medicine established, which allowed the foundations of music in therapy to progress from no science to soft science and most recently to actual brain science. Evidence for \"early music therapy\" will be discussed in four broad historical-cultural divisions: preliterate cultures; early civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel; Greek Antiquity; Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Baroque. In reviewing \"early music therapy\" practice, from mostly unknown periods of early history (using preliterate cultures as a window) to increasingly better documented times, including preserved notation samples of actual \"healing\" music, five theories and applications of early music therapy can be differentiated. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Research has revealed that, when housing conditions are unfavorable, they can interfere with child health, academic performance, and cognition. Little to no research, however, has considered whether adverse housing conditions and early-onset delinquency are significantly associated with one another. This study explores the associations between structural and non-structural housing conditions and delinquent involvement during childhood. Data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) were employed in this study. Each adverse housing condition was significantly associated with early-onset delinquency. Even so, disarray and deterioration were only significantly linked to early delinquent involvement in the presence of health/safety hazards. The predicted probability of early-onset delinquency among children exposed to housing risks in the presence of health/safety hazards was nearly three times as large as the predicted probability of early-onset delinquency among children exposed only to disarray and/or deterioration, and nearly four times as large as the predicted probability of early-onset delinquency among children exposed to none of the adverse housing conditions. The findings suggest that minimizing housing-related health/safety hazards among at-risk subsets of the population may help to alleviate other important public health concerns-particularly early-onset delinquency. Addressing household health/safety hazards may represent a fruitful avenue for public health programs aimed at the prevention of early-onset delinquency. \u00a9 Society for Community Research and Action 2017.\n[Fitness and health benefits of team handball training for young untrained women - A cross-disciplinary RCT on physiological adaptations and motivational aspects](http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/2389651745) [DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nHornstrup, Therese; Wikman, Johan Michael; Fristrup, Bj\u00f8rn\n2018-01-01\nwas equal to 85% \u00b1 6% HRmax.

However, very limited information from functional neuroimaging studies exists on the functional topological configuration of the human brain during specific developmental periods. In the present study, we utilized continuous resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (rs-fNIRS) imaging data to examine topological changes in network organization during development from early childhood and early adolescence to adulthood. Our results showed that the properties of small-worldness and modularity were not significantly different across development, demonstrating the developmental maturity of important functional brain organization in early childhood. Intriguingly, young children had a significantly lower global efficiency than early adolescents and adults, which revealed that the integration of the distributed networks strengthens across the developmental stages underlying cognitive development. Moreover, local efficiency of young children and adolescents was significantly lower than that of adults, while there was no difference between these two younger groups. This finding demonstrated that functional segregation remained relatively steady from early childhood to early adolescence, and the brain in these developmental periods possesses no optimal network configuration. Furthermore, we found heterogeneous developmental patterns in the regional nodal properties in various brain regions, such as linear increased nodal properties in the frontal cortex, indicating increasing cognitive capacity over development. Collectively, our results demonstrated that significant topological changes in functional network organization occurred during these two critical developmental stages, and provided a novel insight into elucidating subtle changes in brain functional networks across development.

We hypothesize that high diffusion contrast diffusion trace-weighted image with enhanced T2 may improve stroke lesion conspicuity. Methods: Five hyper acute stroke patients (M:F = 0:5, average age = 61.8 \u00b1 20.5 y/o) and 16 acute stroke patients (M:F = 11:5, average age = 67.7 \u00b1 12 y/o) were examined six-direction tensor DWIs at b = 707 s/mm 2 . Three different diffusion-weighted images, including isotropic (isoDWI), diffusion trace-weighted image (trDWI) and T2-enhanced diffusion trace-weighted image (T2E t rDWI), were generated. Normalized lesion-to-normal ratio (nLNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of three diffusion images were calculated from each patient and statistically compared. Results: The trDWI shows better nLNR than isoDWI on both hyper-acute and acute stroke lesions, whereas no significant improvement in CNR. Nevertheless, the T2E t rDWI has statistically superior CNR and nLNR than those of isoDWI and trDWI in both hyper-acute and acute stroke. Conclusions: We concluded that tensor diffusion trace-weighted image with T2 enhancement is more sensitive to stroke lesion detection, and can provide higher lesion conspicuity than the conventional isotropic DWI for early stroke lesion delineation without the need of high-b-value technique.\n[Early Childhood Development and E-Learning in Africa: The Early Childhood Development Virtual University Programme](https://eric.ed.gov/?q=sub-saharan+AND+africa+AND+history&id=EJ873460)\nPence, Alan\n2007-01-01\nThis article explores the development and evaluation of the graduate-level Early Childhood Development Virtual University (ECDVU) programme in Sub-Saharan Africa from 2001 through to 2004.

This review critiques the evidence for psychological debriefing approaches and alternate early intervention strategies. The review critiques the randomized controlled trials of psychological debriefing, and early provision of cognitive behavior therapy. The latter approach involves therapy attention on acutely traumatized individuals who are high risk for PTSD development, and particularly in people with acute stress disorder (ASD). Psychological debriefing does not prevent PTSD. Cognitive behaviour therapy strategies have proven efficacy in reducing subsequent PTSD in ASD populations. Despite the promising evidence for early provision of CBT, many people do not benefit from CBT. This review concludes with consideration of major challenges facing early intervention approaches in the context of terrorist attacks and mass disasters.\n[Validation of the Early Functional Abilities scale](http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/2395307043) [DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nPoulsen, Ingrid; Kreiner, Svend; Engberg, Aase W\n2018-01-01\nmodel item analysis.

In the other side, bull\u2019s or sire age influences the semen quality through sperm membrane constituent. It is known that freezing process change the sperm membrane during the processing stage. This research aims to know the effect of sire age on post freezing sperm viability of Bali cattle. The samples were collected in Singosari Artificial Insemination Centre, Malang, East Java, Indonesia on September - November 2016. Eight Bali cattle (4 and 7 y.o, 4 heads in each group) were used as semen source. Semen was collected using artificial vagina, 10 times spanning for 5 weeks (2 times per week, interval 3 and 4 days) in a row. The samples were then evaluated at fresh, chill and frozen stage. Fresh semen was diluted in Tris-citrate-egg yolk 20% (v/v) followed with chilling and freezing. Semen qualities were observed as sperm % motility (MOT), % live sperm using eosin-nigrosine staining (EOS) and % sperm membrane integrity using hypoosmotic swelling test (HOS). Variable comparisons between age groups were done using t-test. On the average, 4 y.o bulls showed higher semen quality at fresh, chill and frozen compared to 7 y.o in MOT (68.00\u00b16.39 vs 65.9\u00b17.62 56.40\u00b13.71 vs 54.33\u00b15.83 44.25\u00b13.52 vs 40.40\u00b17.06), EOS (72.08\u00b16.63 vs 71.82\u00b17.38 57.81\u00b13.83 vs 57.41\u00b16.32 53.16 \u00b18.41 vs 46.49\u00b19.13) and HOS (60.85\u00b113.91 vs 54.84\u00b113.43 53.16 \u00b18.41 vs 46.49\u00b19.13 44.6\u00b19.39 vs 33.8\u00b110.70) respectively.

Difficulties regarding the measurement of MiL are related to the various theoretical and conceptual approaches and its inter-individual variability. Therefore the \"Schedule for Meaning in Life Evaluation\" (SMiLE, an individualized instrument for the assessment of MiL, was developed. The aim of this study was to evaluate MiL in a representative sample of the German population. Methods In the SMiLE, the respondents first indicate a minimum of three and maximum of seven areas which provide meaning to their life before rating their current level of importance and satisfaction of each area. Indices of total weighting (IoW, range 20\u2013100, total satisfaction (IoS, range 0\u2013100, and total weighted satisfaction (IoWS, range 0\u2013100 are calculated. Results In July 2005, 1,004 Germans were randomly selected and interviewed (inclusion rate, 85.3%. 3,521 areas of MiL were listed and assigned to 13 a-posteriori categories. The mean IoS was 81.9 \u00b1 15.1, the mean IoW was 84.6 \u00b1 11.9, and the mean IoWS was 82.9 \u00b1 14.8. In youth (16\u201319 y/o, \"friends\" were most important for MiL, in young adulthood (20\u201329 y/o \"partnership\", in middle adulthood (30\u201339 y/o \"work\", during retirement (60\u201369 y/o \"health\" and \"altruism\", and in advanced age (70 y/o and more \"spirituality/religion\" and \"nature experience/animals\". Conclusion This study is a first nationwide survey on individual MiL in a randomly selected, representative sample. The MiL areas of the age stages seem to correspond with Erikson's stages of psychosocial development.\nVan Nuys, Ute Elisabeth\n1986-01-01\nPresents reviews of the following mathematics software designed to teach young children counting, number recognition, visual discrimination, matching, addition, and subtraction skills; Stickybear Numbers, Learning with Leeper, Getting Ready to Read and Add, Counting Parade, Early Games for Young Children, Charlie Brown's 1,2,3's, Let's Go Fishing,\u2026\n[Identifying talented young soccer players: conditional, anthropometrical and physiological characteristics as predictors of performance.

Fifty-five players of the Under-14 category of Athletic Club Bilbao participated in this study. Players were classified into 4 playing positions: forwards (n=30, midfielders (n=15, defenders (n=37 and goalkeepers (n=15. Complete anthropometry, chronological age (CA, age at peak height velocity, 15-m sprint test, agility test, Yo-Yo IT level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1, counter-movement jump and hand dynamometry were measured. Results were transformed into z-scores and summed up to make two performance composites (SCORE and SCOREHG. One-way analysis of variance and a Bonferroni post-hoc test were used to examine the differences between playing positions. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to estimate the contribution of independent variables to performance indicators. The level of significance was set at P<0.05. Significant differences were observed between playing positions in body mass and height (P<0.05; CA, maturity offset and muscle % (P<0.01; sum of skinfolds, fat %, endomorphy, sprint and agility tests (P<0.001. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that CA and sum of skinfolds were the most important predictors of performance. Collectively, playing positions were characterised by specific anthropometrical characteristics whereas no significant positional differences were observed in performance. This study provides further insight concerning coaches\u2019 practice of selecting young soccer players because of anthropometrical characteristics rather than for performance advantages.

A non-clinical cohort that had been assessed from 1978 to 1993 at 5 yearly intervals and that had a high prevalence rate of lifetime depression took part in the study. We established an appropriate age cut-off to distinguish early onset (i.e. before 26 years) of major and of minor depression, and examined the relevance of a number of possible determinants of early onset depression assessed over the life of the study. Despite several dimensional measures of depression, self-esteem and personality being considered, they generally failed (when assessed early in the study) to discriminate subsequent early onset depression, with the exception of low masculinity scores being a weak predictor of major and/or minor depression. Early onset depression was strongly predicted, however, by a lifetime episode of a major anxiety disorder, with generalised anxiety being a somewhat stronger and more consistent predictor than panic disorder, agoraphobia and minor anxiety disorders (ie social phobia, simple phobia). The possibility that anxiety may act as a key predispositional factor to early onset depression and to a greater number of depressive episodes is important in that clinical assessment and treatment of any existing anxiety disorder may be a more efficient and useful strategy than focussing primarily on the depressive disorder.\n[Trajectories of Childhood Sexual Abuse and Early Adolescent HIV/AIDS Risk Behaviors: The Role of Other Maltreatment, Witnessed Violence, and Child Gender](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3758233)\nJones, Deborah J.; Runyan, Desmond K.; Lewis, Terri; Litrownik, Alan J.; Black, Maureen M.; Wiley, Tisha; English, Diana E.; Proctor, Laura J.; Jones, Bobby L.; Nagin, Daniel S.\n2013-01-01\nChildhood sexual abuse (CSA) has been associated with HIV/AIDS risk behavior; however, much of this work is retrospective and focuses on women. The current study used semiparametric mixture modeling with youth (n = 844; 48.8% boys) from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) to examine the link between trajectories of CSA (2 to 12 y.o.) and HIV/AIDS risk behavior at age 14 (i.e., sexual intercourse & alcohol use). Trajectory analyses revealed a link between a history of CSA and the development of risky behavior. In addition, trajectories for physical and emotional abuse, but not neglect or witnessed violence, contributed to risky behavior over and above the role of CSA. Child gender did not moderate the findings. Findings highlight the signficance of CSA histories, as well as the broader context of maltreatment, for better understanding the development of risk behaviors in both girls and boys.

However, as spatial attention is known to modulate early visual perceptual processing, we explored whether cognitive load could similarly impact contrast-based perception. We used a dual-task paradigm to assess the impact of a concurrent working memory task on the performance of three different early visual tasks. The results from Experiment 1 suggest that cognitive load can modulate early visual processing. No effects of cognitive load were seen in Experiments 2 or 3. Together, the findings provide evidence that under some circumstances cognitive load effects can penetrate the early stages of visual processing and that higher cognitive function and early perceptual processing may not be as independent as was once thought.\n[Early infection and prognosis after acute stroke](http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/108314882) [DEFF Research Database (Denmark)](http://forskningsbasen.deff.dk/?lang=eng)\nKammersgaard, L P; J\u00f8rgensen, H S; Reith, J\n2001-01-01\nInfection is a frequent complication in the early course of acute stroke and may adversely affect stroke outcome.

Particular attention has been paid to the early diagnosis of the disorder and to the intensive therapeutic intervention. Currently the best prognosis for autism lays in the early diagnosis and intervention. Postponing the diagnosis and the intervention beyond infancy is considered loss of precious time. The diagnosis of autism, which begins early in life, was until recently considered that could be reliability made at the age of 3 years. Recent follow up studies however on children at risk for autism (children who had an older sibling with autism) have shown that the clinical signs of autism emerge at the end of the first year and become distinct by the end of the second year when the diagnosis can reliably be made. From a clinical perspective it is noted that the early clinical signs of risk for autism are related to social communication (e.g. limited or absent response when calling his/her name and to joint attention), stereotype behaviours and body movements or unusual handling of objects (e.g. intensive observation of objects and stereotype movements of hands and tapping or spinning), incongruent regulation of emotions (reduced positive and increased negative emotion). There is also delay in developmental characteristics such as the language (both receptive and expressive) and motor (particularly in postural control - characteristic is the drop of the head backwards when the infant is held in horizontal position). Studies on various aspects of the endophenotype of certain clinical signs among infants at risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders, such as avoidance of eye contact, delay in verbal communication and increase of the head circumference, may provide useful information and may assist the clinician on follow up in the\n[New Early Cycladic Figurine At Nea Styra](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MAA....10...29K)\nKosma, M.\nThe existence of an Early Bronze Age coastal site in the district of Nea Styra has been known since the end of the 19th century when three marble figurines of early Cycladic type had been found in the area. During the 20th century survey investigations conducted by Greek and foreign archaeologists offered new evidence which demonstrated the significance of the site during the Early and Middle Helladic periods. A new figurine of early Cycladic type, which recently came to light at Nea Styra due to the control of building permits by the 11th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, reaffirms the identification of the area as one of the three most important sites on Euboea during the Early Helladic II period. This paper focuses on a newly discovered figurine and its typological character. The new find is compared to the figurines that had been found in the 19th century at Nea Styra. We hope that the scheduled excavations on the private land plot where the new figurine was found will offer new data leading to a better understanding of the character of the Early Helladic settlement in this part of southern Euboea.\n[Fluorescence photodiagnosis of early stage lung cancer](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=24056867) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nKato, H.; Sakai, H.; Konaka, C.; Okunaka, T.; Furukawa, K.; Saito, Y.; Aizawa, K.; Hayata, Y.\n1992-01-01\nSputum cytology examination is the most effective method to detect early stage central type squamous cell carcinoma. As sputum-positive early stage lung cancer usually does not show any abnormal findings on chest X-ray film, fiberoptic bronchoscopy is subsequently performed for localization. However, sometimes cases do not show any abnormal findings of cancer endoscopically because they are very early stage cases. For the purpose of localization of invisible lesions the photodynamic reaction was employed in this study. Photodynamic reaction is achieved by transfer of energy of an excited photo-sensitizer induced by photoradiation of light. This phenomenon was already recognized in the beginning of this century. Study of tumor localization of the bronchial tree using hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) and a mercury arc lamp was first performed in the Mayo Clinic in 1960s. In 1978, krypton laser was used first as a light source by Profio and Doiron. Authors have been doing research on early localization of such endoscopically occult early lung cancer since 1978. They recently developed an image processing system using an excimer dye laser for early localization of lung cancer.

It was written for a non-computer savvy person to be able to develop the early alert system. By creating a Master Sheet and using the syntax from the share function of Google Sheets, a unique sheet can be created for each advisor that limits information sharing of their specific advisees. By adding a Google Form to the sheet, advisor interventions can be captured that reflect interventions made as a result of the early alert sheet. Approximately 52% of students were identified on the early alert sheet by having at least one non-passing score on an exam. There were 35-50% of faculty advisors who documented their interventions in the sheet. The template and coding used to develop this academic early alert sheet may be applied to other central documentation needs, such as professionalism early alert.

Naturalists struggled to cope with a pharmacy's worth of new and unfamiliar substances, texts, and terms, as plants, animals, and the drugs made from them travelled into China across land and sea. One crucial aspect of this phenomenon was the early modern exchange between Islamic and Chinese medicine. The history of theriac illustrates the importance of the recipe for the naturalization of foreign objects in early modem Chinese medicine. Theriac was a widely sought-after and hotly debated product in early modern European pharmacology and arrived into the Chinese medical canon via Arabic and Persian texts. The dialogue between language and material objects was critical to the Silk Road drug trade, and transliteration was ultimately a crucial technology used to translate drugs and texts about them in the early modern world.\n[Challenges and limitations in early intervention](https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.rug.nl%3Apublications%2F9defad2d-cca9-4505-b1f7-15b943fdea83/uquery/Brain%20AND%20cognitive%20AND%20development%20AND%20childhood/id/18/Language/EN)\nHadders-Algra, Mijna\nResearch over the past three decades has shown that early intervention in infants biologically at risk of developmental disorders, irrespective of the presence of a brain lesion, is associated with improved cognitive development in early childhood without affecting motor development.

The combinations of remote sensing, in situ geochemical compositional measurements and photographic observations from both above and on the surface have shown Mars to have a dynamic and active geologic evolution. Mars geologic evolution clearly had conditions that were suitable for supporting life. For a planet to be able to be habitable, it must have water, carbon sources, energy sources and a dynamic geologic past. Mars meets all of these requirements. The first 600 My of Martian history were ripe for life to develop because of the abundance of (i) Water-carved canyons and oceans or lakes with the early presence of near surface water shown by precipitated carbonates in ALH84001 well-dated at approx.3.9 Gy., (ii) Energy from the original accretional processes, a molten core which generated a strong magnetic field leaving a permanent record in the early crust, early active volcanism continuing throughout Martian history, and, and continuing impact processes, (iii) Carbon and water from possibly extensive volcanic outgassing (i.e. H2O, CO2, CH4, CO, O2, N2, H2S, SO2, etc.) and (iv) some crustal tectonics as revealed by faulting and possible plate movement reflected by the magnetic pattern in the crust. The question arises: \"Why would life not evolve from these favorable conditions on early Mars in its first 600 My?\" During this period, it seems likely that environmental near-surface conditions on Mars were more favorable to life than at any later time. Standing bodies of water, precipitation and flowing surface water, and possibly abundant hydrothermal energy would all favor the formation of early life. Even if life developed elsewhere (on Earth, Venus, or on other solar systems) and was transported to Mars, the surface conditions were likely very hospitable for that introduced life to multiply and evolve.\n[Influence of First-Time Mothers' Early Employment on Severe Early Childhood Caries in Their Child](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2012/820680) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nKamila Plutzer\n2012-01-01\nFull Text Available Aim. To examine whether mothers' early employment status is related to the development of severe early childhood caries in their child. Methods. Questionnaire survey of 429 first-time mothers in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia, and dental examinations of their child at 20 months of age. Results. At months of age, 5.6% of children exhibited caries defined as one or more demineralized or cavitated lesions on the upper incisors. Of the mothers, 52.2% had no paid employment, 39.6% were part-time and 8.2% full-time employed. Overall, mothers' participation in the workforce had no influence on the frequency of severe early childhood caries in their child, but there was a significant interaction with family structure. For mothers without employment there was no difference between single, and two-parent families, but children with an employed single mother more frequently had caries than those with a working mother in a two-parent family (. However, there were no significant differences in children's reported general health. Conclusions. The data indicate a need to explore strategies that may assist single mothers and especially those in the workforce to prevent severe early childhood caries in their child.\n[AOSSM Early Sport Specialization Consensus Statement.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27169132)\nLaPrade, Robert F; Agel, Julie; Baker, Joseph; Brenner, Joel S; Cordasco, Frank A; C\u00f4t\u00e9, Jean; Engebretsen, Lars; Feeley, Brian T; Gould, Daniel; Hainline, Brian; Hewett, Timothy; Jayanthi, Neeru; Kocher, Mininder S; Myer, Gregory D; Nissen, Carl W; Philippon, Marc J; Provencher, Matthew T\n2016-04-01\nEarly sport specialization is not a requirement for success at the highest levels of competition and is believed to be unhealthy physically and mentally for young athletes. It also discourages unstructured free play, which has many benefits. To review the available evidence on early sports specialization and identify areas where scientific data are lacking. Think tank, roundtable discussion. The primary outcome of this think tank was that there is no evidence that young children will benefit from early sport specialization in the majority of sports. They are subject to overuse injury and burnout from concentrated activity. Early multisport participation will not deter young athletes from long-term competitive athletic success. Youth advocates, parents, clinicians, and coaches need to work together with the sport governing bodies to ensure healthy environments for play and competition that do not create long-term health issues yet support athletic competition at the highest level desired.\n[Scoping the evidence for EarlyBird and EarlyBird Plus, two United Kingdom-developed parent education training programmes for autism spectrum disorder.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29595336)\nDawson-Squibb, John-Joe; Davids, Eugene Lee; de Vries, Petrus J\n2018-03-01\nEarlyBird and EarlyBird Plus are parent education and training programmes designed by the UK National Autistic Society in 1997 and 2003, having been delivered to more than 27,000 families in 14 countries. These group-based programmes aim to (1) support parents immediately after diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, (2) empower parents, encouraging a positive perception of their child's autism spectrum disorder and (3) help parents establish good practice. In the absence of any previous comprehensive review, we performed a scoping review of all peer-reviewed publications on EarlyBird/EarlyBird Plus. A search was conducted between February and June 2016 using EbscoHost, Sabinet, SAGE Journals, Directory of Open Access Journals, BioMed Central, Scopus, ScienceDirect and grey literature. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion. In total, 18 articles were identified: 16 from the United Kingdom and 2 from New Zealand. We reviewed the context, study populations, design, outcome measures, whether focus was on parental perception, parental change or child changes and programme feasibility. Strong parental support for the acceptability but lower level evidence of efficacy of EarlyBird/EarlyBird Plus was found. Future research should consider randomised controlled trials. There is no research on EarlyBird/EarlyBird Plus in low-resource settings; therefore, we recommend broader feasibility evaluation of EarlyBird/EarlyBird Plus including accessibility, cultural appropriateness and scalability.\n[Developments in early intervention for psychosis in Hong Kong.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23019282)\nWong, G H Y; Hui, C L M; Wong, D Y; Tang, J Y M; Chang, W C; Chan, S K W; Lee, E H M; Xu, J Q; Lin, J J X; Lai, D C; Tam, W; Kok, J; Chung, D W S; Hung, S F; Chen, E Y H\n2012-09-01\nThe year 2011 marked the 10-year milestone of early intervention for psychosis in Hong Kong. Since 2001, the landscape of early psychosis services has changed markedly in Hong Kong. Substantial progress has been made in the areas of early intervention service implementation, knowledge generation, and public awareness promotion. Favourable outcomes attributable to the early intervention service are supported by solid evidence from local clinical research studies; early intervention service users showed improved functioning, ameliorated symptoms, and decreased hospitalisation and suicide rates. Continued development of early intervention in Hong Kong over the decade includes the introduction and maturation of several key platforms, such as the Hospital Authority Early Assessment Service for Young People with Psychosis programme, the Psychosis Studies and Intervention Unit by the University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Early Psychosis Intervention Society, the Jockey Club Early Psychosis Project, and the postgraduate Psychological Medicine (Psychosis Studies) programme. In this paper, we reviewed some of the major milestones in local service development with reference to features of the Hong Kong mental health system. We describe chronologically the implementation and consolidation of public early intervention services as well as recent progresses in public awareness work that are tied in with knowledge generation and transfer, and outline the prospects for early intervention in the next decade and those that follow.\n[Coaching in Early Mathematics.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844243)\nGermeroth, Carrie; Sarama, Julie\n2017-01-01\nFalling scores in math have prompted a renewed interest in math instruction at early ages. By their own admission, early childhood educators are generally underprepared and not always comfortable teaching math. Professional development (PD) in early mathematics is widely considered a main way to increase teachers' skills and efficacy (e.g., Guskey, 2000; Hyson & Woods, 2014; Munby, Russell, & Martin, 2001; Piasta, Logan, Pelatti, Capps, & Petrill, 2015; Richardson & Placier, 2001; Sarama, Clements, Wolfe, & Spitler, 2016; Sarama & DiBiase, 2004; Zaslow, 2014). However, it has been documented that stand-alone PD is not as effective in changing practice (e.g., Biancarosa & Bryk, 2011; Garet et al., 2008; Guskey, 2000; Hyson & Woods, 2014; Institute of Medicine and National Research Council, 2015; Joyce & Showers, 2002; Zaslow, 2014). Site-embedded ongoing support in the form of coaching or mentoring has been shown to be critical for successful implementation (Neuman & Cunningham, 2009; Powell, Diamond, Burchinal, & Koehler, 2010). In this chapter, we describe coaching models and abstract characteristics of effective coaching from the research. With this background, we provide an in-depth view of the coaching aspect of two large empirical studies in early mathematics. We introduce the theoretical framework from which the coaching models for these projects were developed and describe the research on which they were based. We then summarize how the planned models were instantiated and challenges to their implementation within each project. In the final section, we summarize what we have learned and described implications and challenges for the field. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Nonetheless many individuals engage in such risky behaviors. Because individuals with high, as opposed to low, levels of early psychosocial stress are more risk prone and more likely to engage in opportunistic matings, we predicted that individuals reporting EPCs, one of many types of opportunistic mating (e.g., one-night stand, consecutive short-term relationships etc, have higher levels of early psychosocial stress than those who do not. Two types of EPCs were examined: EPC-self (EPC-S, having sex with someone other than one's mate, and EPC-other (EPC-O, having sex with someone else's mate. In a sample of 229 women and 161 men, significantly higher levels of early psychosocial stress were found amongst those reporting an EPC-S than those reporting none, irrespective of EPC-Os. Furthermore, the more EPC-Ss men, but not women, reported the higher their early psychosocial stress. Early psychosocial stress was not associated with EPC-Os irrespective of EPC-Ss. Participants were also classified into one of four groups (no EPCs, EPC-O only, EPC-S only, or EPC-S&O which significantly interacted with early psychosocial stress. Results are discussed from adaptationist and mechanist perspectives and why early psychosocial stress was higher in individuals reporting EPC-Ss irrespective of EPC-Os, but not EPC-Os irrespective of EPC-Ss, than those not reporting the EPC of interest.\n[Effectiveness of early adalimumab therapy in psoriatic arthritis patients from Reuma.pt - EARLY PsA.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29342473)\nSantos, Helena; Eus\u00e9bio, M\u00f3nica; Borges, Joana; Gon\u00e7alves, Diana; \u00c1vila-Ribeiro, Pedro; Faria, Daniela Santos; Lopes, Carina; Rovisco, Jo\u00e3o; \u00c1gueda, Ana; Nero, Patr\u00edcia; Valente, Paula; Cravo, Ana Rita; Santos, Maria Jos\u00e9\n2017-01-01\nObjective To compare outcomes in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients initiating adalimumab (ADA), with short- and long-term disease duration and to evaluate the potential effect of concomitant conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARD) or glucocorticoids. Methods Analyses included adult PsA patients registered in the Rheumatic Diseases Portuguese Register (Reuma.pt) between June 2008-June 2016 who received ADA for \u22653 months. Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) response, tender and swollen joint count, inflammatory parameters, patient (PtGA) and physician global assessment (PhGA), Disease Activity Score-28 joints (DAS28), and Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) were compared between patients with PsA) and those with \u22655 years of disease duration (late PsA). Time to achieving PsARC response was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Of 135 PsA patients treated with ADA, 126 had information on disease duration (earlyPsA, n=41). PsARC response was achieved by 72.9% of the patients (88.0% early PsA vs 62.2% late PsA; P=0.022) after 3 months and by 85.4% after 24 months (100% early PsA vs 75.9% late PsA; P=0.044). Early PsA patients achieved significantly less painful joints (2.7 vs 6.7, p=0.006), lower mean C-reactive protein (0.5 mg/dL vs 1.3 mg/dL; P=0.011), and PhGA (18.3 vs 28.1; P=0.020) at 3 months.

Both the patient's age at the onset of Pompe disease symptoms and the rate of deterioration caused by the disease can vary considerably. In classical infant-onset Pompe disease (IOPD, symptoms start very early in life, and death occurs soon afterward if the disease remains untreated. In later-onset Pompe disease, symptoms are slower to appear, and patients often progress to wheelchair confinement and eventual respiratory failure. A diagnosis can be made by screening for GAA in dried blood samples, followed either by GAA assessment in lymphocytes or in fibroblasts or by the genetic analysis of mutations. Treatment by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT with alglucosidase alfa was approved for human use in 2006. In classical IOPD, treatment significantly lengthens survival and improves motor development and cardiac function. The sooner ERT begins, the better are the results. Newborn screening aims to take advantage of different technologies for diagnosing and treating newborns early on and it yields better outcomes. However, newborns diagnosed early and other long-term survivors may encounter fresh problems, making up a new phenotype of IOPD patients. Further modifications of the treatment, such as a decrease in immune responses to ERT, a higher dosage, a better uptake formulation, and gene therapy delivered locally or systemically are being explored.\n[Early career professionals: the mission of a task force.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27173129)\nBarnes, G D; Lauw, M N\n2016-07-01\nEarly career researchers and clinicians face unique challenges in comparison with more senior colleagues, for instance connecting with expert leaders outside of their own institution to enhance their expertise.

Anthropometric profiling, saliva sampling, sexual maturity assessment (Tanner scale), and physical performance tests (Yo-Yo and vertical jumps) were conducted two weeks prior to the SSGs. Salivary testosterone was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Technical performance was determined by the frequency of actions during SSGs. Principal component analyses identified four technical actions of importance: total number of passes, effectiveness, goal attempts, and total tackles. A multivariate canonical correlation analysis was then employed to verify the prediction of a multiple dependent variables set (composed of four technical actions) from an independent set of variables, composed of testosterone concentration, stage of pubic hair and genitalia development, vertical jumps and Yo-Yo performance. A moderate-to-large relationship between the technical performance set and the independent set was observed. The canonical correlation was 0.75 with a canonical R 2 of 0.45. The highest structure coefficient in the technical performance set was observed for tackles (0.77), while testosterone presented the highest structure coefficient (0.75) for the variables of the independent set. The current data suggest that the selected independent set of variables might be useful in predicting SSG performance in young soccer players. Coaches should be aware that physical development plays a key role in technical performance to avoid decision-making mistakes during the selection of young players.\n[Screening of colorectal early cancer by radiology](https://inis.iaea.orgsearchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&RN=21028007) [International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nMatsukawa, M.; Usui, Y.; Kobayashi, S.\n1988-01-01\nThe incidence of colorectal cancer has been gradually increasing in Japan, and if the present rate of increase is maintained it has been estimated that it will become the most common of all malignant neoplasms by the year 2000. It has been proved that colorectal cancer can be completely cured, if it is treated in its early phase. Early cancer of the large bowel is defined as a cancer which is limited to the mucosal membrane or submucosal layer, regardless of lymph node and distant metastases. Detection of early cancer improves the overall curability of colorectal cancer. The greatest number of early cancers of the large bowel are polypoid lesions in their macroscopic form, and depressed lesions are rarely encountered.

Here, we studied metastasis in a HER2-driven mouse breast cancer model and found that progesterone-induced signalling triggered migration of cancer cells from early lesions shortly after HER2 activation, but promoted proliferation in advanced primary tumour cells. The switch from migration to proliferation was regulated by elevated HER2 expression and increased tumour cell density involving miRNA-mediated progesterone receptor (PGR) down-regulation and was reversible. Cells from early, low-density lesions displayed more stemness features than cells from dense, advanced tumours, migrated more and founded more metastases. Strikingly, we found that at least 80% of metastases were derived from early disseminated cancer cells (DCC). Karyotypic and phenotypic analysis of human disseminated cancer cells and primary tumours corroborated the relevance of these findings for human metastatic dissemination.

Highly stressed caregivers can exacerbate behavior problems, while children with behavior problems may make parenting more difficult and increase caregiver stress. Unknown is: (1) how these transactions originate, (2) whether they persist over time to contribute to the development of problem behavior and (3) what role resilience factors, such as child executive functioning, may play in mitigating the development of problem behavior. In the present study, transactional relations between caregiving stress, executive functioning, and behavior problems were examined in a sample of 1,388 children with prenatal drug exposures at three developmental time points: early childhood (birth-age 5), middle childhood (ages 6 to 9), and early adolescence (ages 10 to 13). Transactional relations differed between caregiving stress and internalizing versus externalizing behavior. Targeting executive functioning in evidence-based interventions for children with prenatal substance exposure who present with internalizing problems and treating caregiving psychopathology, depression, and parenting stress in early childhood may be particularly important for children presenting with internalizing behavior.

It also discourages unstructured free play, which has many benefits. Purpose: To review the available evidence on early sports specialization and identify areas where scientific data are lacking. Study Design: Think tank, roundtable discussion. Results: The primary outcome of this think tank was that there is no evidence that young children will benefit from early sport specialization in the majority of sports. They are subject to overuse injury and burnout from concentrated activity. Early multisport participation will not deter young athletes from long-term competitive athletic success. Conclusion: Youth advocates, parents, clinicians, and coaches need to work together with the sport governing bodies to ensure healthy environments for play and competition that do not create long-term health issues yet support athletic competition at the highest level desired.

It is mainly a disease of the developed countries and accounts for 1,00,000 deaths annually. Breast carcinoma is classified as Early breast cancer, Locally advanced breast cancer and Metastatic breast cancer. By definition early stage breast cancer constitutes breast tumors of clinical stages I, IIa and T2N1M0. Early breast cancer is the one diagnosed by mammography. Women when approaches at this stage, they can go for breast conservation surgery. Not all women are candidates for this approach, and some require mastectomy as part of their treatment. AIM To observe the incidence of early breast carcinoma with particular reference to the time taken by the patients to seek medical advice after the symptoms have developed i.e. the average time taken by the patients to seek medical advice, their appropriate management and prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was conducted over a period of 2 years from Oct-2012 to Oct-2014 in 30 female patients aged between 25-65 years who were presented with lump in breast of size \u22645cms with or without pain, with or without lymph nodes to the outpatient department. All the patients were thoroughly asked about history, examined clinically, investigated, staged and managed by surgery either Breast Conservation Surgery or Modified Radical Mastectomy. Postoperative complications were recorded and followed up regularly. RESULTS The incidence of early breast cancer in this study was 0.98% with peak age incidence between 40-60 years and duration of symptoms <6 months in 18 patients. Breast Conservation Surgery + axillary dissection + Radiotherapy was done in 23%. Prognosis was good in these patients with no local recurrence and death.

A total of 895 four-grade girls from eight elementary schools in Taipei City and County were identified as a closed cohort from the first semester of 1993. Data were collected from self-administered questionnaires and school records. A total of 799 girls who had not menstruated in the first year remained in the group through 1994. The effects of potential predictive factors were assessed by logistic regression. Among the 799 girls followed, 69 (8.6%) had first menstruation between the fourth and fifth grades. Height, weight, body mass index and maternal early onset of menarche were positively related to the onset of menarche within the preceding year. Energy consumption during exercise showed only moderate association after being adjusted for age and weight. Calorie intake from junk food was not associated with early menarche within the preceding year. Poor interpersonal family relationships and stressful life events also showed a moderate association with early menarche. The data obtained supported the hypothesis that height, weight, body mass index and maternal early menarche are positive predictive factors of early menarche. The effects of exercise and childhood stress are less prominent.\n[Exome sequencing identifies early gastric carcinoma as an early stage of advanced gastric cancer.](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3871845?pdf=render) [Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70)\nGuhyun Kang\nFull Text Available Gastric carcinoma is one of the major causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early detection and treatment leads to an excellent prognosis in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC, whereas the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC remains poor. It is unclear whether EGCs and AGCs are distinct entities or whether EGCs are the beginning stages of AGCs. We performed whole exome sequencing of four samples from patients with EGC and compared the results with those from AGCs. In both EGCs and AGCs, a total of 268 genes were commonly mutated and independent mutations were additionally found in EGCs (516 genes and AGCs (3104 genes. A higher frequency of C>G transitions was observed in intestinal-type compared to diffuse-type carcinomas (P = 0.010. The DYRK3, GPR116, MCM10, PCDH17, PCDHB1, RDH5 and UNC5C genes are recurrently mutated in EGCs and may be involved in early carcinogenesis.\n[International Nuclear Information System (INIS) ](http://inis.iaea.org/search/)\nDongen, J.A. van\n1989-01-01\nThe therapy of early breast cancer has been changing during the last decennium. It requires a multi-disciplinary approach and in each of these disciplines improvements have been implemented. The result is that treatment schedules can now be adapted to specific subgroups. In this review early breast cancer is defined as operable disease, using the criteria set out by Haagensen. Emphasis is given to describing the new developments in prognostic criteria, since these form the basis for creating subgroups for specific treatment schedules. Distinction is made between the factors relating to growth rate and those relating to metastatic potential. Data on screening promises a beneficial effect of the implementation of screening in national health care programs. Important shifts are seen in treatment schedules; the place of postoperative radiotherapy after classic ablative treatment is being challenged, whereas it plays a major role in the new breast conserving therapy schedules. The data mentioned in the review suggest that a large proportion of 'operable' cases can be treated with breast conservation but details in the technique of breast conserving therapy are still under investigation. They form a major part of the coming prospective studies in breast cancer. Improvements in reconstruction techniques, creating better cosmetic results, make reconstruction more competitive with breast conserving therapy. The use of chemotherapy and endocrine manipulation in early breast cancer has now been clearly confirmed by the overview technique by the Peto-group, thanks to all efforts of individual trialists together.
