Ladipo \nProfessor in the Department of Obstretrics and Gynaecology, University \nCollege Hospital. Ibadan, Nigeria \nbortion is one of the \noldest methods of pre\u00ad\nventing unwanted \nbirths. Although uni\u00ad\nversally practised, it is \nnot universally accepted. It remains \none of the most hazardous procedures \nwhen attempted by unqualified per\u00ad\nsons or by women themselves. As a \nresult the rates of maternal injuries and \ndeaths are inexcusably high. It is \nestimated that at least 200,000 women \nin the Third World die each year from \nbotched abortions: \nAccording to a 1987\u00b7 report, about \n33 million legal abortions are per\u00ad\nformed in the world each year. If we \nadd to this the estimated number of \nillegal abortions, it increases the. \nworldwide total to between 40 and 60 \nmillion abortions per year. Abortion is \na global reproductive health problem \nwhich cannot be ignored. \nA variety of life-threatening compli\u00ad\ncations can occur when induced abor\u00ad\ntion is badly performed . If health care \nservices are immediately available, the \nwoman may fully recover, but often \nthere are lasting consequences includ\u00ad\ning compromised reproductive \nfunction. \nInfection (sepsis) is the most \ncommon complication seen in \ndeveloping country hospitals. Most \ncases of infection follow abortions \ninduced by unskilled persons using \nnon-sterile instruments and/or leaving \nproducts of conception in the uterus. \nThe medical management of septic \nabortions include a number of expen\u00ad\nsive laboratory tests, surgery to \"clean \nout\" the infected contents of the \nuterus, high doses of antibiotics, and \ncareful monitoring of the patient by \nmedical personnel. \nIncomplete abortion (where some \nproducts of conception remain in the \nuterus) without infection may follow \ninduced abortion (or spontaneous mis\u00ad\ncarriage). The woman suffers from \n20 heavy or persistent bleeding and an \nenlarged uterus, and must be treated \nby surgery or vacuum aspiration . \nDamage to the cervix, vagina or \nuterus is usually caused by unqualified \npersons. When there is internal haem\u00ad\norrhage or intestinal injury, major \nsurgery is required. \nToxic reactions to drugs or \nchemicals can occur when patients use native herbs or caustic chemicals to \nattempt abortion. \nHaemorrhage (bleeding) may be \nheavy or mild and protracted , and can \nbe due to incomplete abortion, injury \nto the cervix, vagina or uterus, or to \ncaustic chemicals which have been \nused to cause abortion. Medical man\u00ad\nagement may involve surgery and \noften necessitates blood transfusion . \nSeveral hospital-based studies indi\u00ad\ncate that complications following abor\u00ad\ntions account for a majority of \ngynaecological emergency admissions \nto hospital in a large number of \ndeveloping countries. The manage\u00ad\nment of these complications puts a \nmajor strain on limited health \nresources . \nPreventive measures \nAbortions are induced because \npregnancy is unwanted, so it is rational \nto consider that sex education and \nwidespread availability of safe and \neffective contraceptives would be \nhighly effective preventive measures. \nUnfortunately, contraceptives are \noften not available to those who need \nthem most. These include adolescents \nin all parts of the world (who are at the \nstorm-centre of a transition in sexual \nbehaviour) and many married women \nwho live in depressed economic cir\u00ad\ncumstances in developing countries. \nIt ,is essential to provide accurate, \nunderstandable information about \nsexuality and contraception, using \nct,llturally acceptable approaches, to \nenable sexually active women and men \nof whatever age to understand the \nvarious risks and responsibilities of \nsexuality and reproduction, and to \nenable them to avoid these risks, \nwhether through abstinence or \neffective contraception . Such edu\u00ad\ncation could include a reproductive \nhealth curriculum in the schools; peer \ncounseling enlisting the help of young \nmen and women; brief, readable repro\u00ad\nductive health education materials for \npublic distribution ; and educational \nprogrammes and materials for parents. \nManaging abortion complications \npresents a major health challenge in \ndeveloping countries. However, the \ncurrently high levels of' injuries and \ndeaths can be reduced by improving \naccess to qualified medical services \nand effective family planning. _ \n\u2022 This article was excerpted , with pennission, from a \ntalk that Dr Ladipo presented at the Christopher \nTIetze Intemational Symposium on Women's Health \nin the Third World, Rio de Janeiro, October 1988. \nProceedings of that symposium were published in \nDecember 1989 as a supplement to the International \nJournal of GynaecoJogy and Obstetrics. \nWORLD HEALTH, April-May 1990 \n", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
