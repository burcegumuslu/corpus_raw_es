This Symposium wants to be a forum for the exchange of knowledge and experiences among members of the educational community of different countries, in the search for dialogue, to help us find guidelines for an integrative educational framework. For this reason, the IV Plenary Session on Education will be celebrated in Tarragona.\nOn Friday 13th, in our pre-congress in Barcelona and during the morning session, different \nworkshops have been offered in order to provide participants practical teaching.\nTalking about the congress itself, we will start on Friday 13th in the plenary room at 2 p.m. \nDuring the opening of our meeting, and before the plenary lectures, the Heel 2019 prize will be awarded to the best Integrative Medicine article of the previous year.\nOn Saturday we will have 5 more rooms for lectures, two of them for oral communications, \nready to receive brilliant national and international speakers who investigate and treat in the fields of Integrative Medicine.
