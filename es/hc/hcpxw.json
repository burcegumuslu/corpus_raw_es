International Journal of Health Sciences and Research 12, n.\u00ba 1 (5 de enero de 2022): 36\u201345. http://dx.doi.org/10.52403/ijhsr.20220106.\nCovid-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-COV-2, which can cause severe respiratory illness and complications in patients. Recognizing Ayurveda's endless possibilities for improving immunity and preventing disease progression, the Ministry of AYUSH developed and approved the Ayurvedic protocol for handling Covid-19. Even though Ayurveda practitioners have been prescribing medicines to the Covid-19 patients since approval, no studies have been reported from Kerala regarding the effectiveness of the Ayurveda Treatment approaches. Hence the School of Fundamental Research in Ayurveda designed an observational study to evaluate the impact of the Ayurveda Treatment approaches in the management of Covid -19. The study result affirms that the Ayurvedic treatment method is very effective against Covid-19 and the role of Ayurveda in addressing the Covid-19 challenge is invaluable. Key words: Covid-19, Ayurvedic protocol, School of Fundamental Research in Ayurveda.\n2\nWarrier, Maya. \"Seekership, Spirituality and Self-Discovery: Ayurveda Trainees in Britain\". Asian Medicine 4, n.\u00ba 2 (2008): 423\u201351. http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/157342009x12526658783691.\nAbstractThis paper examines the backgrounds and motivations of persons trained or training as Ayurvedic practitioners at two London-based institutions offering Ayurveda programmes at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. It draws upon in-depth interviews with individuals at various stages of their training and practice in order to examine the paths that bring them to Ayurveda, their motivations for undergoing training, and the ways in which they apply their knowledge of Ayurveda during and after their training period. The findings here corroborate what other scholars have demonstrated in the case of Asian traditions like Yoga and Ayurveda in the West. These traditions have inevitably undergone shifts in meaning by virtue of their assimilation into the Western, in this case British, holistic health milieu. Most significant in Ayurveda\u2019s case is the shift away from a preoccupation with remedial medicine (the bedrock of mainstream Ayurveda in modern South Asia), to a focus on self-knowledge and self-empowerment as a path to \u2018holistic healing\u2019 (understood to address mental and spiritual, not just physical, well-being). Even though the Ayurvedic curriculum transmitted at the educational institutions in London is based largely on that taught at Ayurveda colleges in India, the completely different orientations and dispositions of students in Britain (as compared to their South Asian counterparts) ensures that the Ayurveda they go on to apply and practise is radically different\u2014this is \u2018spiritualised\u2019 Ayurveda, in radical contrast to the \u2018biomedicalised\u2019 version obtaining in modern mainstream South Asian contexts.\n3\nAzizah, Imamatul Azizah, Riska Syafitri y Umy Kalsum. \"Sejarah Teknik Pengobatan Kuno India (Ayurveda)\".

Healer 1, n.\u00ba 1 (17 de septiembre de 2020): 45\u201347. http://dx.doi.org/10.51649/healer.10.\nThe future of healthy and prosperous Nepal lies in Ayurved rather than Allopathy. Most of the allopathy drugs in Nepal are imported foreign drugs that not only take away our currency but even leave numerous side-effects to patients in the name of curing one particular illness. It is a truthAllopathy is more effective in emergency medical condition for speedy cure. But, the value of ayurveda in preventing people from getting sick is incomparable. By applying the principles of ayurveda in our way of living and by introducing standard ayurveda practices as school level education curriculum of Nepal, we can create healthier Nepal, prosperous Nepal, and selfdependent Nepal. Medicinal values inherent in herbs and raw materials that nature has gifted to us, that grow densly in our garden, jungles, heavenly soil needs to be massively marketed in domestic and international pharmaceutical industry. Herbs and raw materials that we are supplying since long to world cheaply are coming back to Nepal as expensive tablets and packets. Our Health system though recognizes ayurveda, unani and allopathy as three medical systems, government's over attention to allopathy and neglect to ayurveda has brought smile into the faces of medical mafia who want to extend their allopathy market by using all means for commercial motive. Though Ayurveda medicine takes longer time to cure illness and restore health in comparison with allopathic medicine, ayurveda, if made our way of life and art of living, our families, societies and nations will get much healthier. Ayurvedic mode of health care and treatment modality has to be generalized and allopathy is to be limited only in exceptional situation where allopathy is inevitable for restoration of health loss.\n5\nAsore, Gangaprasad, Shardul Chavan y Vishakha Vivek Sonawane. \"FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF BHAISHAJYA KALPANA\".

The acceptability of alternative medicines particularly the herbal medicinal formulations has now become a critical need of time. In this article the fundamental principles of Bhaisha-jya Kalpana (Ayurvedic pharmaceutics) has been taken into account so that one can understand the per-spective behind the formulations describe in ancient Ayurved Samhitas. The basic principles of ayurvedic drug formulations and pharmaceutics are basically Paribhasha, Mana, Panchavidha kashaya kalpana, Ra-sa-Guna-Veery-Vipaka, Anukta or Visheshokta Grahan etc. Keywords: Bhaishajya Kalpana, Ayurvedic pharmaceutics, Fundamental principles\n6\nAbraham, Leena. \"Sociology of a Regional Medicine\".

This article, which is based on interviews with Ayurvedic practitioners from several social backgrounds and training modalities, analyzes the social dimensions of Ayurveda\u2019s transformation in twentieth-century Kerala, South India. It argues that in the twentieth century Ayurvedic practitioners from two caste groups, Ezhavas and Brahmans, who belonged to established medical lineages were active in the institutionalization of a distinctive therapeutic tradition in the region that is now known as Kerala. Both groups devised new pedagogic, clinical, and manufacturing strategies to protect their family- and caste-based medical lineages and made good use of the new avenues offered by the modern state, modernized Ayurvedic education, and the market to reproduce, adapt, and consolidate their position in Ayurveda in the region. The concept of \u201cinheritance capital\u201d is used to explore the consolidation and reproduction of regional medical lineages and the associated social advantages over successive generations.\n7\nShinde, Sarika T. \"Clinical efficacy of ayurveda treatment modalities in the management of garbhashosh (intrauterine growth restriction): a systematic review\". International Journal of Advances in Medicine 7, n.\u00ba 12 (23 de noviembre de 2020): 1878. http://dx.doi.org/10.18203/2349-3933.ijam20205051.\nConcept of fetal well-being has gained importance in conventional science in recent era, but this concept of \u2018supraja janana\u2019 was a prime concern of Ayurveda since old era. Apart from prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a major public health problem in most of the developing countries. While going through ayurved classics it is revealed that garbhashosh is one of the disease, which is comparable to intrauterine growth restriction in modern medicine. In Ayurveda various drugs and preparations have been described for treatment of garbhashosh. These drugs are comparatively safe without any unwanted side effects. Aim of this work was to review and meta-analyze the effictiveness of various ayurvedic treatment modalities for garbhashosh with respect to (w.r.t.) IUGR. An attempt to expand the concept of IUGR according to Ayurveda and to yield a flourishing result to this world-wide problem through Ayurveda, this topic has been selected for the study. Going through pathology and main clinical signs and symptoms, garbhashosh can be correlated with IUGR. It is observed that, total 5 clinical studies and 1 case study have been reported on management of IUGR by using classical formulations of Ayurveda. The results and observations obtained through demographical data, effect of therapy observed on the ultrasound parameters as well clinical parameters of garbhashosh w.r.t. IUGR were statistically significant. Results were obtained in favour of most of the ayurvedic formulations. Through this review it can be stated that bruhaniya gana sidha kshirbasti and kshirpan, shatavari kshirbasti, shatavaryadi kshirbasti, yashtimadhu vidari siddha kshirbasti, shatavari ashwagandha phalaghruta kshirbasti, can be given to a pregnant women with IUGR after completion of 28th weeks of gestation, without any complication either in mother or in child. It is cost effective as compared to modern drug.\n8\nTiwari, S. B., S. D.

In the prehistoric times medicinal plants were used by the various tribes. Evidence suggests that the people of Indus valley civilization followed this system of medicines. The Vedic and post Vedic period saw the rapid development of Ayurveda supported by the efforts of Charaka, Susrutra and Vagbhata etc. Buddhist monks played important role in the propagation of Ayurveda. However, the invasion of Muslims after 10th century destroyed Ayurveda and Unani system of medicines flourished in the country. Pre independence period again saw the emergence of Ayurveda. After Independence it attains new height with its incorporation into the Drug and Cosmetic Act. The preparation of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia helps in the standardization of Ayurvedic drugs to compete at global level with allopathic system of medicines.\nKeywords: ayurvedic system, Vedic and post Vedic period, Charaka, Susrutra and Vagbhata, Ayurvedic drugs\n9\nTomar, Anil y M.

International Journal of Research in Ayurveda and Pharmacy 13, n.\u00ba 2 (28 de febrero de 2022): 90\u201395. http://dx.doi.org/10.7897/2277-4343.130244.\nIn ancient Ayurveda Samhita, Acharyas have defined all diseases elaborately, and these diseases can be found precisely today in modern science. In Ayurved Samhita, all the tvak rog (skin diseases) are defined under the term Kustha which is mentioned as a Raktapradoshaja vikara. Kustha is one of the diseases that commonly affect the population. Ekakustha is one of the types of ksudrhakustha. Ayurveda text does not directly correlate to a single disease of modern science which can be compared with the modern disease term \u201cPsoriasis\u201d. Psoriasis may be compared with many types of ksudrhakustha like- kitibha, charmdal, mandala and ekakustha. Psoriasis is a most common non-infectious and inflammatory skin disease which involves hyper-proliferation of keratinocytes in the dermis. In the origin of any disease and for the diagnosis of the disease, there are many factors mentioned in Ayurveda Samhita; in that series, prakriti is one of the significant factors. The concept of prakriti is given by the Indian ancient science of Ayurveda. Prakriti indicates phenotypic and genotypic constitutions. Every individual has a different anatomical, physiological and psychological function. Prakriti of individuals should be known to maintain health, prevent disease, and treat disease. Pittaja dosha predominance prakriti is mainly prone for tvak rog. In the present era, increased demand for Ayurveda science is required to understand the depth of Ayurvedic principles in an easy method. Hence an effort has been made to ascertain and establish the knowledge regarding ekakustha from a modern perspective.\n10\nReetika, Pathak, Inchulkar S.

November 2020 08, n.\u00ba 11 (18 de noviembre de 2020): 5096\u201399. http://dx.doi.org/10.46607/iamj2008112020.\nAddiction is habitual psychological or physiological dependence on a substance or practice that is beyond voluntary control. It is a chronic brain disease that causes compulsive substance use despite harmful consequences. Addiction causes widespread harmful effect to human being along with its social consequences. The term addiction does not only refer to dependence on substance such as heroin or alcohol. A person who cannot stop taking a particular drug or chemical has substance dependence. In Ayurveda every human being is considered a combination of both mind and body. The perfect balance of mind, body and soul is considered ideal health in Ayurveda and is the result of a pure body and selfless mind. There are specific mental treatments in Ayurveda to cure physical problems as well as mental disorders. The mental attitude of a person plays an important role in the caring process. Even modern medical science admits that there is a direct co-relation between a healthy mind and healthy body. Ayurveda helps in an addict\u2019s long-term recovery by changing their lifestyle rather than simply giving them a pill to swallow. Ayurvedic therapy is generally accomplished through a careful diet, herbal medicines, exercise, massage therapy, personal counseling and forms of Yoga. Present article is aimed to explore all the possible treatment modalities from the treasure of Ayurved texts which may be used for de-addiction\nComplimentary and alternate medicine, especially Ayurveda is gaining popularity in United States. However, there are various barriers that people face in adopting Ayurvedic practices into their lives and making cultural, familial and societal changes to better their health. This research explores these relationships and barriers behind why some people adopt and are able/unable to sustain Ayurvedic practices in the presence of traditional bio-medicine.\n2\nKe\u00dfler, Christian. \"Wirksamkeit von Ayurveda bei chronischen Erkrankungen : systematische Analyse klinischer Ayurveda-Studien /\".

Thesis, McGill University, 2003. http://digitool.Library.McGill.CA:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=79815.\nThis thesis examines how physicians in the Indian diaspora living in Canada---both those trained in Ayurveda in India (vaidyas) and those trained in Western medicine in India (MDs)---view the practice of Ayurveda in Canada. More specifically, it examines how their views have been influenced by New Age thought in general and Transcendental Meditation in particular and how these perceptions reflect the changing relation of religion and Ayurvedic medicine. It is the intent of this thesis to show that Ayurveda in Canada exists mainly as part of the greater New Age movement, as a transformed system that is inspired by both Hinduism and New Age thought, and that this transformation of Ayurveda evokes two distinct responses from Indian diaspora medical personnel in Canada---one unsupportive and one partially supportive. To the dismay of \"traditional\" Indians and to the praise of \"modern\" Indians, New Age Ayurvedic organizations strongly emphasize their version of \"spirituality\" as the primary goal of Ayurveda, whereas Indian forms of Ayurveda---both in the past and today---generally approach religion and spirituality secondarily. Thus, the role of religion and spirituality become major controversial issues in New Age Ayurveda. From the \"traditional\" point of view, the commercial achievements of New Age organizations (such as the Transcendental Meditation Movement) are not indicative of a successful introduction of Ayurveda in North America and run contrary to classical Ayurvedic principles, with regard to religious and medical practice. But, from the \"modern\" point of view, the New Age Ayurvedic emphasis on spirituality is indicative of an inevitable evolution of the system in North America.\n6\nForsberg, Susann. \"Ayurveda versus Biomedicine - Competition, Cooperation or Integration?\" Thesis, Malm\u00f6 h\u00f6gskola, Fakulteten f\u00f6r h\u00e4lsa och samh\u00e4lle (HS), 2013. http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:mau:diva-26261.\nKroniska sjukdomar \u00f6kar v\u00e4rlden \u00f6ver, i b\u00e5de utvecklings- och industrialiserade l\u00e4nder.

Non-communicable diseases [NCDs] are increasing in both developing and developed countries. Western medicine is not able to offer satisfying solutions and treatments for people suffering from NCDs. TM/CAM have shown promise of effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of NCDs and many people now turn to TM/CAM. Hence it is of great interest to investigate the possibilities of increased integration of TM/CAM in national health care systems. This study was carried out in Sri Lanka, with the aim to investigate the main forces promoting and obstructing cooperation and communication between practitioners of Ayurvedic, Western and traditional medicine, in order to see how this affects integration of the medical subsystems. The focus of this qualitative study was the \u201cOutcome oriented, evidence informed Ayurvedic Community Health Promotion Program\u201d; a collaboration project aiming to integrate Ayurveda and Western medicine in primary health care. Semi-structured interviews, participatory observation and document analysis were carried out during three months in Sri Lanka and the results were analysed using Paul Unschuld\u2019s theory on structured competition, cooperation or integration. The results indicate that the overall coexistence of Ayurveda and Western medicine in Sri Lanka is structured competition, while the collaboration project is aiming for structured cooperation. The results further show that the Sri Lankan parallel political approach to integration can be argued to obstruct integration, while the regulation of Ayurvedic practitioners increases cooperation through professionalization. Education is a main influencing factor for cooperation; lack of CAM-knowledge in medical students obstructs cooperation while westernization of Ayurvedic doctors both promotes and obstructs cooperation and integration. Capacity building, research based on Ayurvedic fundamentals and keypersons with knowledge of both sectors are of importance for increased cooperation and integration to come about.\n7\nAlba, Mariana Palmieri Brand\u00e3o. \"Ayurveda no Brasil: trajet\u00f3rias e (re)inven\u00e7\u00f5es\". reponame:Reposit\u00f3rio Institucional da UFSC, 2015. https://repositorio.ufsc.br/xmlui/handle/123456789/135137.\nDisserta\u00e7\u00e3o (mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro de Filosofia e Ci\u00eancias Humanas, Programa de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Antropologia Social, Florian\u00f3polis, 2015.

I draw a distinction between the systems of knowledge production about the body and the institutionalisation of medical practice. This allows me to examine how both processes contributed to the development of South Asian national identity in the early twentieth century. I do this through an examination of governmental (at both the central and provincial level) negotiations of Ayurveda contrasted with popular understandings, in order to examine the meaning of Ayurveda as a knowledge system and as lived practice in the late colonial period. Chapter 1 traces the evolution of Ayurveda from its inception as an idea in the Atharvaveda to the end of the Mughal period, framing its importance as a textual tradition overseen by Brahman Pandits, but also as a lived medical practice associated with complicated ties to religious, ethnic, or community identity. In Chapter 2, I investigate the history of Ayurveda from 1780 until the end of the nineteenth century, focusing on its relationship to the colonial state. Chapter 3 explores a shift in attitude on the part of the Imperial Government beginning in 18995, when the Indigenous Drugs Committee was created in order to explore the potential contribution of Ayurvedic \u2018knowledge\u2019 to the development of an Indian-based pharmacological industry, juxtaposed with the imposition of medical regulatory acts that limited the practice of the indigenous medical systems in the Provinces of British India. Chapter 4 explores the development of a discourse about medicine in Hindi-language popular publishing. Chapter 5 traces the development of a legislative framework established to incorporate the adoption of the indigenous medical services through several significant political periods. Chapter 6 explores the functioning of some of the institutions developed, and reflects upon the social and cultural concerns that framed the unfolding of institutions.\nN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Al\u0101.

It is presumed that Ayurveda is one of the oldest scientific ways of keeping, promoting, and conserving a healthy life. The various natural ingredients that are used in Ayurvedic therapy are of great medical value as is described in the Vedic literature on Ayurveda. The Ayurveda's history laid down the instructions of maintaining healthy lifespan as well as fighting against illness by different types of therapies like massages, diet control, herbal medicines, and exercises. Nowadays, green marketing is a rapidly growing concept, and consumers are willing to pay more for green products. Green marketing affects all areas of the economy. It does protect not only the environment but also creates a new market and job opportunities. The study is focused on the concept of Ayurveda especially in the resorts of Kerala. The majority of consumers have felt that their actions had a proportional impact on the environment.\n10\nBrooks, Jim. \"Ayurveda\".
