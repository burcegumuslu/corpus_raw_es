This substance is chemically hardened after application to give people those perfectly arched almond nails. While they\u2019re inexpensive and gorgeous, you\u2019ll need to soak your fake nails in [acetone](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=3&tid=1) until they soften enough to be removed gently. Ouch!\nNext, let\u2019s look at gel manicure. Lots of people like it because it\u2019s quick and durable. But, you need to place your hand under UV light for 30 seconds for it to set. That\u2019s not fun, either.\nSome people opt for SNS or dip powder. It doesn\u2019t require special chemicals to harden, and it doesn\u2019t require UV rays for curing. It also looks natural and lasts longer. But for dip powder to work, it uses a\n[resin-type glue](https://www.insider.com/are-dip-powder-nails-bad-for-you-2018-3). Not the best ingredient for your nails, as you might have guessed.\nThat leaves us with traditional nail polish. But of course, not all polishes are created equal, either. You should always opt to choose non-toxic products. Thankfully, many options exist \u2013 you only have to know what you\u2019re looking for.\nWhat Is Non-Toxic Nail Polish?\nIf you\u2019re a non-toxic nail polish newbie, the lingo is probably going to confuse you. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 we\u2019re here to shed light on the matter.\nThree-, Five-, Seven-, 10- and 12-Free: What\u2019s The Difference?\nNo nail polish is entirely natural or chemical-free \u2013 it just depends on how many harmful ingredients are absent from the product.\nThe most basic is three-free, which doesn\u2019t contain\n[formaldehyde](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=216&tid=39), the carcinogenic chemical used to preserve specimens in labs. It also doesn\u2019t contain [dibutyl phthalate](https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+922), a plasticiser that\u2019s linked to developmental and reproductive issues. Finally, you also wouldn\u2019t want [toluene](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MMG/MMG.asp?id=157&tid=29) in your polish \u2013 a chemical that causes headaches and brain or kidney damage. It can even be harmful to a developing foetus.\nHere are the harmful chemicals that are absent from each one.\n- 5-Free - Formaldehyde, formaldehyde resin, toluene, camphor and dibutyl phthalate\n- 7-Free - Formaldehyde, formaldehyde resin, toluene, camphor, dibutyl phthalate, ethyl tosylamide and xylene\n- 10-Free - Toluene, dibutyl phthalate, formaldehyde, formaldehyde resin, camphor, ethyl tosylamide, xylene, parabens, animal by-products and fragrance\n- 12-Free - Toulene, MIT, formaldehyde, dibutyl phthalate, parabens, formaldehyde resin, camphor, ethyl tosylamide, xylene, MEHQ/HQ and animal by-products\nCareful With Your Choice Of Remover Too!\nYour effort to choose a polish that works for you will be for nothing if you use a harmful nail polish remover like acetone. Nourished Life offers a safe and gentle\n[alternative](https://www.nourishedlife.com.au/natural-nail-polish/6821/fresh-therapies-nail-polish-remover.html). Or, you can use a [homemade](https://www.femina.in/beauty/skin/diy-natural-nail-polish-remover-120935-5.html) solution.\nTop 12 Non-Toxic Nail Polishes In Australia\nLooking for the best natural nail polish takes more than just ordering from Priceline or Chemist Warehouse.
