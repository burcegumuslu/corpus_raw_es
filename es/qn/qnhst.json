There are more than 100 drugs of known \nstructures that are extracted from higher plants and \nused in allopathic medicine (Cox, 1994; Farnsworth, \n1990). Different pharmaceutical dos age forms or \npreparations including decoctions, aromatic waters, \nextracts, infusions, ointment, powders, tinctures, etc. \nwere originally designed to extract and concentrate the \nactive drug principles like alkaloids, glycosides and \nvolatile oils (Koul et al ., 2005). The active ingredients \nof plant extracts are chemicals that are similar to those \nin purified medications, and they have the same \npotential to cause serious adverse effects (De Smet, \n2004).  \nAlpinia calcarata  Roscoe (Family: \nZingiberaceae), is a rh izomatous perennial herb which \nis commonly used in the traditional medicinal systems \nin Sri Lanka. The mature rhizomes are branched and \ndense with a light to dark brown color (Jayaweera, \n1982). Kong and co -workers (2000;  2002) have \nisolated some  diterpenes such as calcaratarins A \u2013E ,  \nsesquiterpenes such as shyobunone and coumarins \nsuch as herniarin from the rhizomes of  A. calcarata   \ngrown in China. According to Arambewela and co -\nworkers (2005a), 18 volatile constituents were \nidentified in essential oils of A. calcarata  rhizomes, \nroots and leaves. Further, 1, 8 \u2013 cineol was found to be \nthe major constitue nt in the oils of rhizomes and \nleaves while in the roots, it was \n  fenchyl acetate.  \nA. calcarata rhizomes are known to possess a \nbroad spectrum of medicinal properties. In Sri Lankan \nTraditional Ayurveda medicine, rhizomes of A. \ncalcarata  is recommended a s an aphrodisiac and a \ndecoction is widely used in the treatment of bronchitis , \ncough , respiratory ailments, diabetics, asthma  and \narthritis  (Jayaweera, 1982; Rama nayake, 1994 ). For \nthe preparation of decoction, 60 g of rhizomes in dried \nform is introduced into a clay pot and gently boiled in \n1920 mL of water for about 3 h and the final volume \nreduced to 240 mL using a low flame. The dosage \nrecommended for administ ration to an adult is a half a \ncup (120 mL) two times per day. Experimentally, A. \ncalcarata  rhizomes of Sri Lankan origin have shown to posses antinociceptive (Arambewela et al., 2004), \nantioxidant (Arambewela and Arawwawala, 2005b), \naphrodisiac (Ratnasoor iya and Jayakody, 2006), \ngastroprotective (Arambewela et al., 2005c and 2009a) \nand antidiabetic (Arambewela et al., 2009b)  activities \nof hot water extract (HWE) and hot ethanolic extract \n(HEE) of A. calcarata rhizomes. However, no \nextensive safety studies  have been conducted on \nextracts of A. calcarata  rhizomes to date. Therefore, \nthe aim of the present study was to investigate whether \nhot water extract (HWE) and hot ethanolic extract \n(HEE) of A. calcarata  rhizomes have any toxic effects \nin rats.  \n \nMATERIAL S AND METHODS  \nPlant material  \nFresh A. calcarata  rhizomes were collected from home \ngardens in Western Province of Sri Lanka between the \nperiod of August \u2013 November. The plant material was \nidentified and authenticated by the curator of National \nHerbarium, Ro yal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya, Sri \nLanka. A voucher specimen (AS 01) was deposited in \nthe Industrial Technology Institute, Colombo 7, Sri \nLanka.  \n \nPreparation of the hot water extract (HWE)  \nFresh A. calcarata  rhizomes were cut into small pieces \nand air  dried for 5 -6 days in the shade. Five hundred \ngrams of dried rhizomes were boiled with 2.5 L of \ndistilled water (DW) for 4 h. The hot water extract was \nconcentrated under vacuum at 60 \u00ba C and freeze -dried \nat \u2013 20\u00ba C (yield 15.6 % w/w dry weight basis) and \nstored at 4 \u00ba C until use.  \n \nPreparation of the hot ethanolic extract (HEE)  \nFresh A. calcarata  rhizomes were cut into small pieces \nand air dried for 5 -6 days in the shade. Five hundred \ngrams of powdered rhizomes were extracted with 1.5 \nL of ethanol using so xhlet extraction apparatus for 4 h. \nThe extraction was filtered and the filtrate was \nevaporated to dryness under reduced pressure at 50 \u00ba C \n(yield 18.5% w/w dry weight basis) and stored at 4 \u00ba C \nuntil use. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; MW -44,000) \nco-precipitate  of the extract was prepared by mixing \ncrude ethanolic extract and PVP in the ratio of 1:1 \n(w/w).  \n \nAnimals  \nHealthy adult male Wistar rats (weighing 200 -225 g) \nwere used throughout the investigation. They were \nhoused under standardized animal house conditi ons \n(temperature: 28 \u201331\u00ba C, photoperiod: approximately Arambewela  et al Safety profile of Alpinia calcarata Roscoe in traditional medicine in Sri Lanka   \n \nBoletin Latinoamericano y del Caribe de Plantas Medicinales y Arom\u00e1ticas/ 437 \n 12 h of natural light per day, relative humidity 50 \u2013\n55%) and fed with standard rat and water ad libitum. \nAll animal experiments were conducted in accordance \nwith the internationally accepted laboratory  animal use \nand care and guide lines and rules of the Faculty of \nScience, University of Colombo, for animal \nexperimentation.  \n \nExperimental design  \nThirty six male rats were weighed and randomly \nassigned into 4 equal groups (n = 9/group). The rats in \ngroup 1  were orally treated with 1500 mg/kg of HWE \nin 1 mL of DW while the rats in group 2 orally treated \nwith 1 mL of DW (served as the control group 1). Rats \nin group 3 were orally treated with 1500 mg/kg of \nHEE while the rats in group 4 orally treated with 150 0 \nmg/kg of PVP in 1 mL of DW (served as the control \ngroup 2) for 42 consecutive days between 10.00 h \u2013 \n11.00 h.  \nIn our previous investigations we have used \ndoses ranging from 100 \u2013 1000 mg/kg from HWE and \nHEE of A. calcarata  to investigate antinociceptive \n(Arambewela et al., 2004), aphrodisiac (Ratnasooriya \nand Jayakody, 2006), gastroprotective (Arambewela et \nal., 2005c and 2009a) and antidiabetic (Arambewela et \nal., 2009b) activities in vivo . Therefore, in the present \nstudy, tested dose level is 2 to 6 fol d higher than that \nhave been used in investigation of biological activities.  \n \nDetermination of general toxic effects  \nRats were checked twice daily (9.00 h and 16.00 h) for \novert signs of toxicity (salivation, diarrhoea, \nlacrymation, tremors, ataxia, yello wing of hair, loss of \nhair, postural abnormalities or behavioral changes), \nstress (fur erection or exophthalmia), aversive \nbehaviors (biting paw and penis, intense grooming \nbehavior, scratching behavior, licking at tail or \nvocalization) and mortality. Perc entage weight gain \nand, food and water intake were determined weekly \nduring the period of treatment for each group. The \nconsistency of faeces and color of urine were noted \ndaily.  \n \nDetermination of effects on hematological \nparameters, renal and hepatic func tions  \nOn day 1 post treatment, approximately 4 mL blood \nwas collected from the tail of the treated rats under \nmild ether anesthesia and divided into two equal parts. \nTo one part ethylenediamine tetra -acetic acid (EDTA) \nwas added and red blood cell (RBC) c ounts, white \nblood cell (WBC) counts and hemoglobin (Hb) \nconcentration were determined using standard procedures (Ghai,  1993). Other part was allowed to \nclot (25 - 30 min.) at room temperature (28 \u2013 30\u00ba C) \nand subjected to 15 min centrifugation at 3200 rpm  for \nthe collection of serum. Finally, serum samples were \nanalyzed for concentrations of urea, creatinine, \naspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine \naminotransferase (ALT).  \n \nEffects on external morphology and wet weights of \nselected organs  \nOn day 1 pos t treatment rats were sacrificed with over \ndose of ether and weighed. The liver, kidneys, testes, \nadrenal glands, heart, spleen, vasa deferentia, prostate \nglands, seminal vesicles together with coagulating \nglands, cauda epididymides and caput plus corpus \nepididymides were examined for gross external \npathological abnormalities. These organs were \nremoved, blotted free of blood and wet weights were \nrecorded. Weights of the organs were expressed as a \npercentage of the body weight.  \n \nEffects on histopathology of selected organs  \nSmall pieces of organs such as heart, intestine, kidney, \nliver were fixed in 10% formalin and routinely \nprocessed for histopathology. These pieces were \nembedded in paraffin and cut into 7 \n m thick sections. \nSections were stained with hemato xylin and eosin and \nmounted between a slide and cover slip for \nmicroscope.  \n \nStatistical analysis  \nStatistical comparisons were made using one way \nANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s family error test.  A  P  \nvalue  \n  0.05 was considered as significant.  \n \nRESULTS  \nGene ral toxic effects  \nThere were no treatments \u2013 related deaths with both \nextracts. Further, HWE and HEE treated rats showed \nnormal food intake, water intake, and their % weight \ngain were not significantly ( P \u2265 0.05) altered (Table \n1). The consistency of faec es and colour of urine of \nHWE and HEE treated rats were similar to that of \nrespective control groups. There were no overt signs \nof toxicity, stress or aversive behaviors in A. calcarata  \nextracts treated rats.  \n \nEffects on hematological parameters, renal an d \nhepatic functions  \nCompared to the respective controls neither HWE nor \nHEE had significant ( P \u2265 0.05) effects on RBC and Arambewela  et al Safety profile of Alpinia calcarata Roscoe in traditional medicine in Sri Lanka   \n \nBoletin Latinoamericano y del Caribe de Plantas Medicinales y Arom\u00e1ticas/ 438 \n WBC counts, concentrations of  Hb,  creatinine, urea, \nALT or AST  (Table 2 and Table 3).   \n \nTable 1  \nEffects of the hot water extract (HWE) and the hot ethanolic extract (HEE) of Alpinia calcarata  rhizomes  on food and water \nconsu mption and body weight gain in rats treated for 6 weeks (mean \n  S.E.M., n = 9)  \n \nTreatment  n  Food    Water    Body weight gain  \nintake/week (g)  intake/week(mL)  (%) \n \n \nC1  9  12.7 \n  1.0  22.0 \n  1.8  28.2 \n  2.0 \n(1 mL of DW)  \n \nHWE   9  14.5 \n  0.9  27.1 \n 2.3  26.4 \n 2.3 \n \nC2  9  13.4 \n  1.1  24.5 \n  3.0  26.1 \n  2.5 \n(1500 mg/kg of PVP  in 1 mL of DW)  \n \nHEE   9  15.3 \n  1.8  26.7 \n  2.7  27.5 \n  3.1 \nC1: Control for the HWE ; C2: Control for the HEE ; DW: Distilled water ; PVP: Polyvinylpyrrolidone  \nNot significant with the resp ective control groups; P \u2265 0.05  \n \nTable 2  \nEffects of the hot water extract (HWE) and the hot ethanolic extract (HEE) of Alpinia calcarata  rhizomes  on some selected \nblood parameters in rats treated for 6 weeks (mean \n  S.E.M., n = 9)  \n \n \nTreatment   n RBC count   WBC count   Hb concentration  \n  \n 106 mm3    \n 103 mm3      g/dL \n \n \nC1   9 6.90 \n  0.08  8.00 \n  0.14  18.27 \n  0.19 \n(1 mL of DW)  \nHWE     9  6.99 \n  0.07  8.16 \n  0.12   18.11 \n  0.21 \n \nC2   9 6.81 \n  0.07  8.10 \n  0.28  18.16 \n  0.11 \n(1500 mg/kg of PVP in 1 mL of DW)  \nHEE    9  6.87 \n  0.11  8.12 \n  0.21  18.22 \n  0.11 \nHb: Hemoglobin ; RBC: Red blood cell ; WBC: White blood cell ; C1: Control for the HWE ; C2: Control for the HEE ; DW: \nDistilled water ; PVP: Polyvinylpyrrolidone .

Medicinal \nplants have been used for centuries as remedies for \ndisease because they contain component of therapeutic \nvalues ( Kumar and Chandrashekar, 2011 ). However , \nthe usefulness of any drug depends not only on its \ntherapeutic efficacy but also on its lack of toxicity or \nadverse side effects. In the present study, A. calcarata  \nextracts were devoid of unacceptable side effects even \nafter following chronic administra tion in rats. There were no overt signs of toxicity, stress, aversive \nbehaviors. The food and water intake, % weight gain, \nconsistency of faeces and color of urine of HWE and \nHEE treated rats were similar to that of respective \ncontrols.  \nThe results obtaine d for hematological \nparameters, showed that the blood counts of HWE or \nHEE treated rats remained similar to that of respective \ncontrol groups. An initial step in detecting liver \ndamage is a simple blood test to determine the \npresence of certain liver enzym es in the blood. The \nmost sensitive and widely used liver enzymes are the \naminotransferase which include AST and ALT. These \nenzymes are normally found within liver cells. If the \nliver is injured, the liver cells spill the enzymes into \nblood which in turn r aises the enzyme levels in the \nblood and signals the liver damage (Champe and \nHarvey, 1994). As Compared to the respective control \ngroups, the concentrations of ALT and AST were \nnormal in the treated groups. Therefore, A. calcarata  \nextracts were devoid of any hepatic damage.

If kidney function falls, \nthe creatinine level will rise. On the other hand, urea is \nthe major end product of protein nitrogen metabolism. \nThe determination of serum urea nitrogen is an \nimportant index of kidney function. Impaired renal \nfunction or increased tissue protein breakdown are \nassociated with increased urea nitrogen levels whereas \nkidney damage or pregnancy are associated with \ndecreased levels (Champe and Harvey, 1994).  In this \nstudy, the crea tinine and urea parameters were normal \ncompared to that of respective controls. Therefore, this \nindicated that A. calcarata  extracts were devoid of \nrenotoxicity.  \nAn interesting finding in our study was that \nboth extracts significantly increased the weight  of the \nspleen, which possibly suggests lymphoproliferative \nactivity. This is novel and clinically important finding \nof the plant. Similar results have also been reported \nwith A. galanga (Bendjeddou et al ., 2003) a close \nrelative plant of A. calcarata  and also with Withania \nsomnifera  (Davis and Kuttan, 2000) which is used in \nthe indigenous system of medicine. In contrast, \nadministration of methanolic extract of Tylophora \nasthmatica  leaves for 15 consecutive days in rats \nsignificantly decreased the weights o f spleen (Malathi \nand Gomez, 2008). It is generally accepted that the \nactive principles (whether natural or synthesized) may \nbe more toxic than the whole extract or its crude form \n(Saxena, 1985). In crude preparations, perhaps, the \nother components that ar e present in addition to the \nactive components may be influencing the effects of \nthe active components as well as the other toxic components in the crude preparation (Koul et al., \n2005). Therefore, crude plant extracts do not usually \ndemonstrate adverse ef fects. This may be the reason \nfor the safety of A. calcarata  extracts indicated in this \nstudy.  \nIn conclusion, A. calcarata  HWE and HEE \nwere found to be safe in terms of hepatotoxicity (as \njudged by AST, ALT levels), renotoxicity (as judged \nby urea and cre atinine levels) or hematotoxicity (as \njudged by WBC, RBC counts and Hb concentration), \ngross morphology, weights of organs, stress or \naversive behaviors at a dose level which is 2 to 6 fold \nhigher than that have been used in investigation of \nbiological act ivities.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT  \nNational Science Foundation for the Research Grant \n(SIDA (1L) 2000/BT/03).   \n \nREFERENCES  \nArambewela LSR, Arawwawala LDAM, Ratnasooriya \nWD. 2004.
