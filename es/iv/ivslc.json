It uses a 'whole evidence' approach and provides an in-depth analysis of Chinese medicine treatments for depression, including a summary of Chinese medicine treatments used in classical Chinese medicine literature, as well as treatments that have been tested in clinical trials.\nHigh-quality and rigorous scientific methodology is used to evaluate the clinical trial literature of Chinese medicine treatments for unipolar depression, treatment modalities including Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture and other Chinese medicine therapies. The findings are analyzed and potential implications for clinical practice and research are explored.\nChinese medicine practitioners and students who want to keep up to date with the latest research to support and incorporate into their clinical practice, this book is ideal.\nThe different modalities of treatment for unipolar depression covered in this book includes herbal medicine, acupuncture and combination of these therapies. Treatment effects for depression are described in change in depression severity, change in quality of life and relapse rate. Further, herbal formulae, herb ingredients and acupuncture points are analyzed and discussed in relation to treatment. Findings from this book can provide guidance for Chinese medicine practitioners when treating depression.\n[Tel 91 593 99 99](tel:003491 593 99 99)\nFax 91 448 21 88\n[Dir](/contacto)\nC/ Artesanos, 46\nC/ Artesanos, 46\nParque Empresarial Prado del Espino\n28660 Boadilla del Monte\nMadrid\n[Mailinfo@axon.es](mailto:info@axon.es)\n\u00a9 2023 Ax\u00f3n Librer\u00eda S.L.\n2.87.2", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["/", null, "/resultados/tags/libros/depresi\u00f3n", "http://media.axon.es/pdf/128890.pdf", "http://media.axon.es/pdf/128890_1.pdf", "tel:003491 593 99 99", "/contacto", "mailto:info@axon.es", "/privacidad", "/condiciones", "/quienes-somos", "/aviso-legal", "/contacto", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/axon-libreria", "https://www.pinterest.es/axonlibreria/", "https://twitter.com/axonlibreria", "https://www.facebook.com/libreriaaxon"]}
