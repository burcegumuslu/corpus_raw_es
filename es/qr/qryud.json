segundo / Fr. B. de las Casas. 1559. 391 leaves, bound ; 30 cm. A copy, in secretarial hand, of the second of the three books comprising Las Casas\u2019 monumental chronicle of the discovery, exploration, and colonization of America, describing events which took place between 1501 and 1510. Las Casas begins with the settlement of the island of Hispaniola, under the governor Bobadilla, and later, under fray Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando, comendador de Lares, and discusses the conquest of other islands as well, such as Cuba and Puerto Rico. He documents the Spaniards\u2019 vicious treatment and cruel massacres of the Indians, and attacks the system of repartimiento which forced the Indians to work as slaves in the mines and plantations. He also describes how the Spaniards, when faced with a dwindling Indian population on Hispaniola, brought in additional slaves from the Lucayo Islands. A substantial part of the second book deals with Christopher Columbus, and includes an account of his fourth voyage, as well as material on his mistreatment at the hands of officials in the Indies; his repeated requests to the Spanish Crown for compensation for his services; and finally, his death in 1506. The ms. contains a preface, dated November 1559 and signed by Las Casas, in which he requests that the rector of the Colegio de San Gregorio not allow the Historia to be read for 40 years, after which time it should be published for the good of the Indians and of Spain.

Legal memorandum on moral and legal questions, such as justifiable motives for the conquest, civil rights, due process, judicial and executive powers, and church and state relations. The author discusses 27 fundamental question of law, analyzing the legal arguments and the application of the laws behind those issues. He begins by questioning Spain\u2019s authority in the New World and her right to seize Indian lands, and then proceeds to find legal authority for the conquest. He also provides legal arguments in answer to questions concerning the right of both secular and non-secular clergy to \"doctrinas,\" or ownership of Indian villages; the powers, jurisdiction, and precedence of ecclesiastical judges; and the procedures for dealing with abuses of those powers. Other issues for which he provides legal defense deal with personal and civil liberties of the Indians, and the legality of the encomienda and repartimiento, or the forced labor of the Indians in the fields and mines. There are sections on the legal justification for, and exemption from, taxation; the legal establishment of the duties and powers of the viceroy, and his relationship to the Audiencia; and legal controls on the behavior of judges. Finally, the author discusses legal questions involving the administration of the Real Hacienda (royal treasury), the regulation of taxes, prices, monetary value and currency; and public accountability of judges and officials. The ms. is signed by secretary Crist\u00f3val Nu\u00f1ez de Le\u00f3n. Mexico Mexico City 1595 Manuscripts. Spanish jurist and scholar. Salazar studied law at the University of Salamanca, and received his doctorate in law from the University of Mexico on August 23, 1591.

Unsigned, undated draft, possibly written between 1810-1813 during the existence of the Cortes de C\u00e1diz, of two arguments in favor of abolishing the mita in Peru, the only place in which the system remains in operation. The relationship between the interests of the Indians and the interests of the state has always been an important issue for Spain. Since the national congress or \"Cortes\" will undoubtedly vote to abolish the \"mita,\" and thus needs no further persuasion, the author, Jauregu\u00ed [?] seeks to educate the public by correcting two mistakenly-held views on forced labor: first, that without the mita, the mines in America would have been left untouched for lack of workers, given the difficulty of the work and the natural laziness of the Indians. However, history proves this case wrong, and the author cites Sol\u00f3rzano, who points out that more Indians voluntarily worked the mines in Huancavelica and Potos\u00ed than were forced. Furthermore, there was no mita in Mexico, yet there were plenty of Indians available to work in the mines at Guanajuato. Finally, the higher wages meant that the Indians would naturally want to work in the mines. The second myth to be disproved is the idea that the Indians are especially suited to working in the mines. The author notes that mines all over Spain and Europe have been worked for centuries by people other than Indians. The Indians\u2019 strength as mineworkers is not due to some innate aspect of their constitution, but to the tolerance built up after many years of such work. If criminals are punished by sending them to work in the mines, why condemn innocent Indians to the same fate? The author hopes that the congressional representatives will vote to abolish the system of forced labor forever. In Spanish. Robles, E.G.

In his introduction to Book XX, Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo praises the many men whose bravery and sacrifices led to the discoveries that made the Spanish empire the greatest in history, unsurpassed by those of\n31\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory Alexander the Great, or the Greeks, Romans, or Egyptians. The author expresses his admiration for the early disoveries of Columbus which were the basis for all the subsequent explorations and conquests in the Indies which added another hemisphere and a half to the empire of Charles V. Book XX specifically describes Magellan\u2019s 1519-1521 voyage through the Strait of Magellan, his discovery and exploration of the Philippine Archipelago, and his death at the hands of Indians on the Philippine island of Mactan. Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo bases some of his material on accounts by eyewitnesses such as Antonio Pigafetta and Juan Sebasti\u00e1n de Elcano, captain of the Victoria, the only one of Magellan\u2019s ships which returned to Spain. Book XX also describes a second expedition to the Moluccas, led by Garc\u00eda Jofre de Loayasa in 1525, which retraces Magellan\u2019s route through the Strait to the Mariana Islands and the Philippines. Several chapters describe the geography of the Moluccas and some of the manners and customs of the natives. In Spanish. Butler, R.L. Check list of the mss. in the Ayer Coll., 1348 Lietz, P.S.

[ca. 1850] 2 v. ; 24 cm. A chronological register of letters from 1504-1563, pertaining to the Spanish conquest of America, in particular to the treatment and trade of Negro and Indian slaves, copied by Sir Arthur Helps from the Mu\u00f1oz Collection in the Biblioteca Nacional in Madrid. All of the letters, which date from August 26, 1504 to October 10, 1563, refer in some way to the slave trade in the Spanish colonies of the New World, not only to the sale and transport of Indian slaves\n33\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory to work in the mines and canefields, but to the importation of Negro slaves from Africa and Brazil by the Spanish and Portuguese. Recurrent themes are the economic importance of slaves, and the harsh treatment of them by the Spanish. The letters include excerpts from legal testimony in cases involving ownership of slaves; royal c\u00e9dulas concerning importation and customs duties on slaves; directives from the king to treasury officials and colonial administrators; protests to Carlos V from slave-owners concerning new laws freeing Indian slaves; and requests to the Consejo de Indias for permission to import slaves. Correspondence from church officials concerns the religious education of the Indians and their payment of tithes, and protests their harsh treatment. There are many references throughout to the decimation of the native populations of the Caribbean islands, such as Cuba, Santo Domingo, and Puerto Rico. Some of the letters are copied in both volumes. In Spanish, with marginal and inside cover notes in English. Butler, R.L.

Contemporary copy in secretarial hand of a letter most likely written in 1776, from Father Garc\u00e9s to Father Diego Jim\u00e9nez, guardi\u00e1n of the Colegio de la Santa Cruz in Quer\u00e9taro. Jim\u00e9nez and Viceroy Bucareli requested Garc\u00e9s to join the Anza expedition as far as the Colorado River and to explore the surrounding Indian territory. Garc\u00e9s traveled from Tubac to the Gila River, and west to Yuma, Arizona. He explored the Colorado River south to the Gulf of California and north to Needles and Oraibe in Hopi territory, then headed west over the mountains to the San Joaqu\u00edn Valley and the Gabriel mission. Garc\u00e9s mentions that his diary is not yet ready to send, and so includes an abbreviated account of some of the highlights and findings of his journey from October 21, 1775 to September 17, 1776. He reports on the reception given to him by the various Indian tribes in the area of the Gila and Colorado Rivers, and indicates which ones he thought were ready to receive religious instruction. He comments throughout on the terrain, mentioning rivers and mountains, even observing the latitude of places visited using a quadrant and compass. He concludes by stressing the need to establish missions and presidios, not only to convert the Indians, but to open up communication between Sonora, the Colorado River area, and California. Spanish Franciscan missionary and explorer of the Southwest. Garc\u00e9s served as head of the mission of San Xavier del Bac, where, from 1768 to 1781, he lived among the Apaches, Yumas, Gilas, and Mojaves, working to convert them to Catholicism. He made many journeys into Indian territory to the west and north between 1768 and 1779. In 1781, Garc\u00e9s was brutally murdered by Yuma Indians. In Spanish. Butler, R.L.

The set includes transcripts of royal c\u00e9dulas, legal proceedings, petitions, financial accounts, inventories, chronicles, diaries, letters, and reports. Materials relate primarily to the discovery, conquest and settlement of Mexico and U.S. territories once under Spanish rule\u2010\u2010New Mexico, Texas, California, Florida, and Louisiana\u2010\u2010between 1518 and 1817.

Another important section is the \u02baReales c\u00e9dulas\u02ba or royal decrees concerning exploration, colonization, Indians, missions, defense, and official appointments. The Inquisition documents are mainly financial records and records of trials for bigamy and heresy. There is viceregal correspondence with the royal court (\u02baCorrespondencia de los virreyes\u02ba); communication among ministries, legislatures, governors, and judges on judicial matters (\u02baJusticia\u02ba); and materials documenting the Mexican wars of independence, 1810\u20101821, with special reference to Salcedo and Arredondo (\u02baOperaciones de guerra\u02ba).

[1774?] [119] leaves, bound ; 34 cm. Unsigned copy of the diary of Anza\u2019s first overland expedition to California, from Tubac to San Gabriel Mission, between January 8 and May 27, 1774. Viceroy Bucareli approved the expedition in September of 1773; and early in 1774, Anza and Father Garc\u00e9s, accompanied by another missionary, Father Juan D\u00edaz and 20 soldiers, set out to establish a land route from Sonora to the port of Monterey. Such a land route, desperately needed for transporting supplies to the settlements in Upper California, had previously been considered unfeasable because of the Gila and Colorado Rivers and the desert beyond. Anza\u2019s diary recounts the difficulties of the journey, such as harsh terrain, lack of food and water, and hostile Indians. He describes the Yuma Indians in great detail, finding them affectionate and generous. The travelers pass through the Colorado Desert, the San Jacinto Valley, and finally reach the San Gabriel Mission on March 22, although Anza continues on to the presidio in Monterey where he arrives April 18. The group returns to Tubac on May 27, having traveled 594 leagues, and pronounces the expedition a success. Mexican military officer and explorer. Born in Sonora in 1735, Anza, like his father and grandfather, was a member of the presdial military aristocracy, so essential to the defense of the outlying Spanish provinces. He served as captain of the presidio of Tubac, an important garrison, and commanded many patrols against the Seri and Apache Indians. He led two expeditions to Upper California, to Monterey and to San Francisco, and was later named governor of the province of New Mexico. Photocopy. [S.l. : s.n., between 1910 and 1935] 34 cm.

(1619 leaves) ; 29 cm. Transcripts of letters, orders and cedulas, legal proceedings, reports, and a diary concerning the government, administration, and defense of Cuba, Florida, and Louisiana from 1770 to 1830. Royal cedulas and orders from 1770\u20101807, from the king and his ministers to officials in the colonies, deal primarily with tariffs, free commerce between Spain and the Indies, and the slave trade; military and political appointments; and local government issues. There are five volumes of letters, dated 1777\u201081, from Bernardo de Galvez, the Spanish governor of Louisiana, to his uncle Jose de Galvez, executive secretary of the Indies; Juan Manuel Cagigal, governor of Cuba; Diego Joseph Navarro; and Pedro Piernas, interim governor of Louisiana, in which he discusses colonial mail service and trade, strategies against the English, Indian problems, fortifications, provisions and supplies, military justice and veterans\u2019 pensions. The 3 volumes on Indian relations from 1783\u20101830 discuss the monopoly on the valuable Indian trade granted by the Spanish to the English firm of Panton Leslie. Important correspondents with Louisiana governors Miro, Carondelet, Gayoso de Lemos, and Casa Calvo include Wm. Panton, Robert Leslie, John Forbes, and Alexander McGillivray. Other letters deal with William Bowles\u2019 1792 attack on Panton\u2019s Apalachee store and with agreements and land transactions between the Indians and the Spanish and English. A volume of military documents from 1800\u20101802 also pertains to Bowles, who had returned to Florida, and the re\u2010taking of the fort at San Marcos de Apalache. The diary of Manuel Garcia, fleet commander, provides an account of naval operations to capture Bowles from Jan. 20\u2010March 14, 1800. Other documents include an inventory of Bowles\u2019 confiscated possessions; a report and map showing plan of attack on the fort; an account of the capture of the fort, June 17\u2010July 11, 1800; and reports to Garc\u00eda\u2019s superiors from 1800\u20101802. The final volume contains papers of the legal proceedings of 1803\u20101805 against Captain Tom\u00e1s Portell, commander of San Marchos, for his role in Bowles\u2019 takeover of the fort.

Garc\u00e9s arrived June 30, 1768 at the mission of San Xavier del Bac, where he was to spend the next 13 years. He comments on the difficulties of instructing the Indians in the Catholic religion, as they are wild and do not apply themselves. The Tugsones have built a hut for him in their village, and Garc\u00e9s plans to spend a week or two living among them. He points out that since even the Jesuits\u2010\u2010who had cows, horses, and cornfields\u2010\u2010had a hard time at the mission, he\u2010\u2010with nothing\u2010\u2010expects many hardships there as well.

Three letters, written between July 1768 and July 1769, from Father Garces to Juan de Pineda, governor and capitan general of the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa, concerning affairs of the missions at San Xavier del Bac and Tucson. In his letter of July 29, 1768, Garces, newly\u2010arrived at San Xavier, congratulates Pineda on his promotion to the rank of colonel. He reports that the two missions are quiet and the Indians peaceful, although he laments their lack of religious instruction. He describes conditions at each mission, indicating number of baptisms, deaths, marriages, and confirmations since 1755. He also requests basic furnishings for the mission such as a chest, 2 locks, a box for the holy oils, and communion utensils, and suggests establishing a school in the future. His letter of February 21, 1769 describes an attack on the mission by Apaches the day before, and although no one was killed, many horses and cattle were taken. Garces points out that measures must be taken to control the Apaches who terrorize the settlements. The last letter, dated July 23, 1769, reports on the continuing problems with\n47\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory the Apaches who threaten the Pima Indians, destroy their crops, resulting in severe food shortages during the winter, and raid the mission supplies and livestock. The Apaches have sworn to destroy the mission settlement and also jeopardize plans for a new village near the junction of the Gila and Colorado Rivers.

Commissioned by the viceroy of New Spain, the conde de Monterey, Vizca\u00edno, Father Ascensi\u00f3n, two other friars, and 200 soldier/sailors set sail in 3 ships from Acapulco on May 5, 1602, to explore the California coastline, take soundings for the bays and ports, and search for the legendary city of Quivira. The account traces the expedition past the Macatl\u00e1n Islands to Cabo San Lucas, at the tip of what is now Baja California, to San Diego, Monterey, San Francisco, and finally, to Cape Mendocino, where they arrive on January 14, 1603. Ascensi\u00f3n comments on the flora and fauna of the coastline, mentioning especially the famous pelicans and the types of fish found there; and describes the hardships faced by the men, such as the severe winds, unpredictable currents, and crippling illnesses. After the party returns to Acapulco in March of 1603, having lost 40 men along the way, Ascensi\u00f3n offers his conclusions that California is an island and that Quivira is not in California but in the province of New Mexico. He points out the importance and value to Spain of pacifying, conquering, and settling California, beginning with Cabo San Lucas. Butler, R.L.

Pal\u00f3u\u2019s letter of June 15, 1772 contains the text of a letter of May 21, 1772 from Father Juan Crespi, documenting his recent explorations with Capt. Pedro Fages in the San Francisco Bay area and as far north as 39 degrees 13 minutes. Upon receiving word that the San Diego mission might be abandoned for lack of food, Crespi and Fages return to Monterey, assemble provisions and supplies, and set out for San Diego which they reach on May 13.

Pinilla names the tribes who live in the area, giving the location and population of each and commenting briefly on their nature and customs and their inclination to be converted to Catholicism. He suggests how best to convert the greatest number of souls at the least expense to the royal treasury, offering his recommendations on the use of troops and cannon against the most hostile of the Indians; strategies against the Apaches; shoeing of horses and mules confiscated from the Indians; and procedures for maximizing supplies of foodstuffs and livestock. He concludes that subjugating the Indians will initially require a substantial outlay of manpower and money by the viceroy, but that, in the end, the savings and benefits to the Crown will be great.

A copy, made in 1792, by Father Manuel de Vega of the Convento de San Francisco in Mexico, of Pal\u00f3u\u2019s history of Upper California and the Franciscan missions with which he was associated from 1768 to 1783. Pt. 1 is an account of the missions of Old or Baja California which were entrusted to Franciscans such as Pal\u00f3u, Juan Cresp\u00ed, and Jun\u00edpero Serra, when the Jesuits were expelled from Mexico in 1767. Between 1768 and 1773, Pal\u00f3u served as head of San Xavier and as business manager for the expeditions of G\u00e1lvez and Portol\u00e1 to Upper California, gathering and forwarding supplies to the new settlements. In 1773, the Dominicans were given control of all the missions in Baja California, and the Franciscans moved on to work in Upper California. Pts. 2, 3, and 4 deal with the founding of San Diego, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, San Gabriel, and San Francisco, and the problems of hostile Indians, disease, lack of provisions, locusts, and floods faced by the missionaries; the movement of supply ships up and down the coast; and the explorations northwards to Canada and Alaska. Pal\u00f3u includes Cresp\u00ed\u2019s diaries of the Portol\u00e1 expedition to Monterey of 1769\u2010 1770; the Fages expedition to San Francisco of 1772; and the P\u00e9rez expedition to British Columbia of 1774; as well as letters of Father Serra to Viceroy Bucareli regarding Monterey.

Unsigned and undated ms. copy of the diary of Anza\u2019s first overland expedition to California, from Tubac to San Gabriel Mission, between January 8 and May 27, 1774. Viceroy Bucareli approved the expedition in September of 1773; and early in 1774, Anza and Father Garc\u00e9s, accompanied by another missionary, Father Juan D\u00edaz and 20 soldiers, set out to establish a land route from Sonora to the port of Monterey. Such a land route, desperately needed for transporting supplies to the settlements in Upper California, had previously been considered unfeasable because of the Gila and Colorado Rivers and the desert beyond. Anza\u2019s diary recounts the difficulties of the journey, such as harsh terrain, lack of food and water, and the possibility of hostile Indians. He describes the Yuma Indians in great detail, finding them affectionate and generous. The travelers pass through the Colorado Desert, the San Jacinto Valley, and finally reach the\n53\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory San Gabriel Mission on March 22, although Anza continues on to the presidio in Monterey arriving April 18. The group returns to Tubac on May 27, having traveled 594 leagues, and pronounces the expedition a success. Throughout his diary, Anza comments on the physical terrain, distances travelled, flora and fauna, characteristics and customs of the various Indian tribes, and the mission settlements. Mexican military officer and explorer. Born in Sonora in 1735, Anza, like his father and grandfather, was a member of the presidial military aristocracy, so essential to the defense of the outlying Spanish provinces. He served as captain of the presidio of Tubac and commanded many patrols against the Seri and Apache Indians.

Spanish translation of Clavigero\u2019s history of Baja California, from the early discoveries of Cort\u00e9s in 1534 to the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1768. The history is divided into 4 books: the first describes the geography of the Baja California peninsula, its flora and fauna, and the customs and social and religious life of the Indian tribes of the area. The second book documents early attempts to colonize the peninsula, the arrival of the Jesuits, the establishment of the first six missions, the difficulties encountered by the missionaries, and the explorations and death of Father Eusebio Kino. Book Three presents the founding of eight additional missions, with accounts of the lives of other great missionaries such as Piccolo, Salvatierra, Basald\u00faa, Ugarte, and Mayorga. The final book discusses the keen interest of the Spanish king, Felipe V, in the settlement of California, and his endorsement of new explorations further north to the Colorado River. Clavigero concludes with the founding of the last four missions, the status of\n54\nCalifornia Christianity in the peninsula, and finally, the expulsion of the Jesuits from the area in 1767. Jesuit scholar, historian, and linguist. Born in Veracruz, Mexico, Clavigero was a gifted student of classical, modern, and native languages, philosophy, and history; and after joining the Jesuit order in 1748, he authored many religious and historical treatises. When the Jesuits were expelled from Mexico in 1767, Clavigero settled in Italy, and began compiling material for his Storia antica del Messico, which he published in Italian in Cesena in 1780\u201081 and which established his reputation as an accurate and objective historian. In spite of poor health, Clavigero managed to finish a history of Baja California, Storia della California, in 1786, a year before his death.

Bound collection of copies, probably made around 1800, of three documents pertaining to the history of California and the missions established there, between 1531 and 1762. The first document, Establecimiento y progresos, dated 1791, is a year\u2010by\u2010year history of the missions of California, from 1531, when Cort\u00e9s began his explorations of the peninsula, to 1767, when the Jesuits were expelled from New Spain and control of the 15 missions already established was handed over to the Franciscans of the Colegio de San Fernando in Mexico. The compiler of the history, an anonymous Franciscan brother, describes the expeditions and missionary work of Fathers Kino, Picolo, Salvatierra, Ugarte, and Mayorga, and includes the texts of several of Salvatierra\u2019s letters to the attorney general of Guadalajara which document events and conditions at the missions. There are several tables, giving populations of the missions, and indicating number of baptisms and confirmations. The narrator concludes with\n55\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory status reports on the missions of San Borja, San Ignacio, and Santa Gertrudis. The second document, Memorias para la historia natural de California, dated 1790, also by an unnamed Franciscan, describes the domestic and wild animals, plants and trees, vegetables, cacti, chiles, and rocks and minerals of California. Also included are a few pages on the designs, colors and significance of the paintings of the Indians of California. Finally, Memorias piadosas, compiled by the Franciscan father Joseph Diaz de la Vega in 1782, contains stories of conversions of the Indians to Catholicism, documenting the exemplary lives and glorious deaths in defense of the faith of certain Otom\u00ed and Iroquoian Indians. Several chapters are devoted to the martyrdom of the Indian boy Christ\u00f3val of Tlaxcala at the hands of his own father.

Letters, from 1768\u20101844, concerning the Spanish missions of Upper California. Much of the early correspondence of missionaries such as Serra, Palo\u00fa, and Lasu\u00e9n with Galvez, the visitor general, viceroys Bucareli and Branciforte, and California governors Neve and Fages concerns the problems and hardships they encountered in establishing missions in the unsettled area of California between San Diego and San Francisco, such as the need for soldiers to defend the missions from hostile Indians, logistical difficulties in moving supplies from Mexico to the peninsula, and lack of provisions due to official cutbacks or poor harvests at the missions. Some letters contain status reports on the missions, with population and revenue statistics, inventories of church furnishings and lists of donations for the new missions. Other topics discussed include proper treatment of the Indians, mission revenues, and rationing of supplies. The later letters, especially those of Father Dur\u00e1n, reflect the growing friction between ecclesiastical and civil authorities over jurisdiction, and increasing government intervention in and regulation of mission affairs.

The group leaves Loreto on February 26, 1769 and in May, reaches San Diego where they rendevous with another segment of the expedition which has made the journey by sea. The overland expedition under the command of Gaspar de Portol\u00e1, continues northward on July 14, 1769, in search of Monterrey, but they discover San Francisco Bay on October 30, 1769. After their return to San Diego on January 24, 1770, another attempt is made to find Monterey. Again Cresp\u00ed and others set out from San Diego, finally claiming Monterey for Spain on May 31, 1770. Cresp\u00ed describes the climate and terrain of the area, noting the earthquakes, redwoods, sea lions and whales they encounter. In addition, he observes the dress and customs of the Indians, and comments on conditions and events at the many missions in which they stop along the way.

Letters Arranged chronologically. Photocopies of letters and miscellaneous documents concerning Father Jun\u00edpero Serra and the explorations, settlements, and missions along the coast of Upper California between 1774 and 1777. Most of the documents are letters written by Father Serra from the missions at San Carlos in Monterey and at San Diego to Antonio Mar\u00eda Bucareli y Urs\u00faa, the viceroy of New Spain at that time, in which Serra thanks the viceroy for past favors and requests funds for the maintenance of the missions, in addition to livestock, mules, church furnishing and vestments, additional workmen, and increased military protection. He sends the viceroy information on harvests at the various missions, Indian hostilities, baptisms, expeditions to explore the California coast, and the construction of new missions at San Francisco and San Juan de Capistrano. The letters also contain references to the acrimonious relations that often existed between Serra as president of the missions of Upper California, the governors of California, and the viceroy. Other correspondence is addressed to Captain Pedro Fages, a governor of California, concerning the release of additional rations for the mission personnel and more soldiers to guard the missions; to Father Guardian Francisco Pangua, listing the names of priests assigned to various missions; to Melchor de Peramas, secretary of the viceroyalty, thanking him for expediting shipments of provisions to the missions; and to other missionaries, Father Vicente Fuster of the San Diego mission and Father Pablo Jos\u00e9 de Mug\u00e1rtegui.

In addition, he describes the Indians they encounter along the way, their physical appearance, manners, dress, and canoes. Pal\u00f3u points out that although the men did not claim any land for the king and did not record every harbor, river, and bay, the expedition did establish a clear route as far north as 55 degrees, and determined that the Indians they met were very different from other native peoples previously encountered. Pal\u00f3u concludes by expressing his support for the expansion of Spanish territory through continued explorations along the coast, and for the raising of the Spanish flag at Punta Santa Margarita and at San Lorenzo harbor.

Serra arrives in San Diego on March 13, 1774, en route to the mission at Monterey. He reports on the difficult conditions at the San Diego and San Gabriel missions, where food and livestock are scarce; and on the few Indians who have been baptized there. He then describes the arduous journey of Juan Bautista de Anza from Tubac to San Gabriel, with Sebastian Taraval, his Indian guide. In addition, Father Serra discusses the many logistical problems of moving supplies and mules from Mexico and between the missions, and requests any assistance that the father guardian may be able to give to the missionaries. He concludes by informing Verger that he will set off for the San Gabriel mission during Easter week. California San Diego 1774 Manuscripts. In Spanish. Butler, R.L.

Copy, probably made around 1777, of an unsigned diary containing an account of various explorations of the frigate Santiago during 1774\u20101775, along the Pacific coast of California, and farther north to Canada, and Alaska. The diary opens with an abbreviated account of the voyage of the frigate Santiago from Monterey on June 6, 1774. Under Captain Juan P\u00e9rez, the expedition reaches the northern part of the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia on July 20, and returns to Monterey in August along the coast, past Vancouver Island and the Columbia River. The following year, Viceroy Bucareli commissions the Santiago to explore as far north as 65 degrees latitude and to map the area as precisely as possible. The frigate, commanded by Bruno Hezeta and accompanied by the schooner Sinaloa, leaves San Blas on March 17, 1775 and during the trip north, takes possession of several sites, including Trinidad off the northern California coast and Bucareli harbor in Washington. With 7 of its crewmembers killed by hostile Indians, and others sick from scurvy, the frigate returns to Monterey on August 29, 1775. The schooner, meanwhile, continues on to southern Alaska, claiming the harbor of Los Remedios, and finally reaches the Gulf of Alaska. The diarist describes the customs, behavior, and dress of the Indians of the area, and includes a list of the missions in the Monterey area, indicating the number of baptisms, marriages, and deaths at each missions, as well as an inventories of livestock, mules, and harvests.

Father Campa\u2019s account of his voyage of exploration aboard the Santiago, from San Blas, Mexico, up the coast of California, between March 16 and November 20, 1775. The expedition, organized by Viceroy Bucareli to counteract possible Russian or English encroachment in the Spanish\u2010dominated Pacific, left San Blas on March 16, 1775. The two ships, the Santiago and the Sonora, sailed northward along the California cost, hoping to explore as far north as 65 degrees latitude. It was a difficult voyage, with many men ill from scurvy; and on July 30, around Vancouver Island, the two ships parted company. Although the Santiago headed home toward the south, the Sonora continued on and reached 58 degrees latitude, near the Gulf of Alaska. Both ships eventually returned to San Blas on November 20, 1775, having taken formal possession for Spain at Trinidad in northern California, on the coast of Washington, and around Salisbury Sound and Bucareli Bay in Alaska.

Sections 33\u201057 present the occupation of New Mexico under the leadership of Juan de O\u00f1ate. Throughout, there are descriptions of the landscape; the appearance, customs, and conversions of Indian tribes such as the Zuni, Navajo, Acoma, and Picuri; and the animals, fish, and other resources of the region, such as pearls, garnets, mother\u2010of\u2010pearl, coral, and gold. The official \u02baapproval\u02ba of the content by Fray Francisco de Velasco is dated Aug. 18, 1629 in the convent of San Francisco in Mexico City. The copy also includes the \u02baapuntamientos\u02ba or comments on Z\u00e1rate Salmer\u00f3n\u2019s work, written many years later by a Jesuit, Fray Juan Amando Niel, possibly an apochryphal name (cf. Ernest J. Burrus, \u02baA forged commentary on Z\u00e1rate\u2019s Relaciones del Nuevo Mexico, Hispanic American historical review, vol. 42). Niel corrects and expands Z\u00e1rate\u2019s accounts, portions of which he quotes at length; clarifies place names; and adds some description of the geography, terrain, fauna, and minerals of New Mexico.

[8] leaves, bound ; 32 cm. Contemporary ms. copy, probably from around 1778 and possibly signed by Father Morfi, of his recommendations to the government for the exploration, pacification, and settlement of New Mexico. Using the diaries and reports of the expeditions of Dom\u00ednguez and Escalante, Anza, Garc\u00e9s, Juan Mateo Mange, Jer\u00f3nimo de Zarate, and Padre Escobar and Juan de O\u00f1ate as the basis for his observations, Morfi points out that the lack of communication between Mexico and New Mexico hindered the success of the Dom\u00ednguez\u2010Escalante expedition of 1776. Had Dom\u00ednguez and Escalante known of the findings of previous explorers, they could have adjusted their route and easily reached Monterey and San Francisco. Morfi also notes that the reports of exploring expeditions are often merely personal diaries, full of omissions, errors, and deceptive geographical descriptions. He criticizes the way in which missionary priests present themselves to the Indians as ambassadors of a great king who will protect them from their enemies, when, in fact, these missionaries are poor and weak, often dependent on the Indians for subsistence. Such misconceptions make unbelievers of the Indians and fuel their resentment and anger. Morfi suggests controlling the Indians through an accurate, more detailed knowledge of the terrain, and eliminating the two tribes hostile to the Spaniards, the Apaches and Comanches. The government should concentrate on developing the territory between the Colorado River to the west and the Rojo River to the east, where pueblos can flourish on the fertile land and the rivers create a natural line of defense for building presidios. Finally, Morfi proposes expeditions to be undertaken by Anza, Velez, and Garc\u00e9s in order to improve relations with the Indians, locate the best sites for pueblos and presidios, and note the natural resources of the area.

Contemporary ms. copies of two letters, from 1775\u20101776, by V\u00e9lez de Escalante, head of the Franciscan mission Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe in Zuni, New Mexico, principally dealing with plans for an expedition to establish an overland route from Santa Fe to Monterey. In his first letter, addressed to Father Fernando Antonio Gomez, secretary to the provincial, and dated August 18, 1775 from Zuni, Escalante requests a replacement for his assistant at the mission, Father Damian, who has left because of illness. He goes on to describe his visit to the Moqu\u00ed (Hopi) Indians, who prove difficult to convert, and the information he receives from Indians in the pueblo of Oraibe concerning a possible route from New Mexico to Monterey by way of the great Colorado River; and suggests that the viceroy should fund an expedition to establish such an overland route. Escalante concludes by noting how difficult it has been to settle New Mexico because of hostile Indians and lack of supplies, and wishes he had more information on Monterey and its surroundings, and the Indians to the south and east. The second letter, signed and dated July 29, 1776, is addressed to the Provincial, Father Isidro Murillo, from Santa Fe, where the expedition suggested a year ago by Escalante is about to begin the search for a route to Monterey. Supported by the viceroy and governor, Escalante has been in Santa Fe helping to plan the exploring party which will be led by himself, Fray Francisco Dom\u00ednguez (not mentioned in the letter), engineer Bernardo de Miera who will go along to map the route, and 20 other men. Escalante foresees difficulties due to lack of credible information about the region and to hostile Indians. Spanish Franciscan missionary priest who came to New Spain in 1769. He served in various missions, and was head of the Zuni mission. In 1776\u201077, he and Father Francisco Dom\u00ednguez led an expedition to open an overland trail from Santa Fe to Monterey. Although they never reached Monterey, they explored the Utah Basin and succeeded in crossing the Colorado River near Glen Canyon, which today lies beneath Lake Powell. In Spanish. Butler, R.L.

Contemporary signed copy of a letter of October 26, 1777 to the king of Spain, Charles III, from Bernardo Miera y Pacheco in New Mexico, dealing with the pacification, settlement, and evangelization of the area around the Colorado and Gila Rivers, between New Mexico and the California coast. Miera offers his advice to the king based on his experience with the Dom\u00ednguez\u2010Escalante Expedition of 1776, for which he served as engineer and cartographer. The expedition, led by Fathers Atanasio Dom\u00ednguez and Silvestre de Escalante, followed a northwest route from New Mexico to 42 degrees latitude in an unsuccessful attempt to reach the port of Monterey, which Miera sees as the key to the control and development of the region. To address the ongoing Apache hostilities, one of the most difficult obstacles to settling the area, Miera recommends stationing well\u2010armed troops in the dangerous Gila province. The great expanses of territory can be unified through a system of presidios and settlements. By establishing three presidios along the Colorado River, Spain can extend its power and control by linking New Mexico with the California coast; bring Christianity to many willing Indian tribes; and replenish the royal treasury by developing the great mineral wealth of the region.

Bernardo Miera y Pacheco to Charles III, the king of Spain, stating his achievements and requesting a commission as captain of the militia of New Mexico in recognition of his loyalty to the king. The petition describes Miera\u2019s years of service in New Mexico, beginning in 1743 when he settled in the presidio and pueblo of Paso del R\u00edo del Norte (now El Paso del Norte, Mexico) and took part in five campaigns against the Apache and Zuma Indians. As militia captain and engineer, Miera mapped the province of El Paso, and later, under Alonso Rub\u00edn de Zelis, he explored and mapped the area along the banks of the R\u00edo del Norte, for which he received no salary. He then moved to Santa Fe with his family, and led three campaigns against the Comanches. Miera describes his recent 1776 expedition with the Franciscan priests Atanasio Dom\u00ednguez and Silvestre Velez de Escalante to open a route northwest from New Mexico to the port of Monterey on the California coast. In conclusion, after noting the valiant services to the Spanish crown by his father Luis de Miera and his grandfather, Antonio Pacheco, Miera requests command of the militia of New Mexico, with salary, as a reward for his loyalty and achievements.

Hampered by difficult terrain and severe weather, the explorers decide on October 8 not to continue on to Monterey, but instead to head south to the Colorado River, which they cross on November 8 at La Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n on the Utah\u2010 Arizona border, near Glen Canyon, now submerged beneath Lake Powell. The trail east takes them home through Oraibi and Zuni, and they reach Santa Fe on January 3, 1777.

Contemporary copy from around 1780 of the diaries of Juan Bautista de Anza and Joseph Antonio Vildosola, documenting the expeditions they led against the Apaches in the Mexican provinces of Sonora and New Mexico during November and December 1780. Anza and 150 men\u2010\u2010regular soldiers, militamen and Indians\u2010\u2010leave Santa Fe, New Mexico, on November 9, 1780 and march southwest to Sonora on a campaign to flush out hostile Apaches, and to open up the area to commerce and settlement. Although many Indians head up into the hills until the soldiers have passed, Anza\u2019s raids are successful in killing and capturing numerous Apaches. The diary is signed by Anza in Arizpe, Mexico on December 18, 1780. With the diary is a cover letter, dated in Arizpe on December 31, 1780, to the governor and commandant general of the Provincias Internas, Teodoro de Croix, in which Anza assesses the results of the expedition.

Report to Pope Urban VIII from Father Alonso de Benavides, concerning the status of the evangelization of the Indians of the province of New Mexico in New Spain. The report, dated February 12, 1634, is a revision of the 1630 Memorial; it begins with background notes on the location, history, climate, and fertility of New Mexico. Benavides describes the religious superstition and idolatry of the Indians, and documents the matyrdom of many of the early priest/explorers, such as Fathers Marchos de Niza, Juan de Padilla, and Agust\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez. The territory is divided up among the missionaries who are responsible for working with and converting specific tribes, including the Tainos, Taos, Apache, Acoma, and Zuni. The missionary work is difficult in such remote areas, and often one priest must serve 4 or 5 villages. Nevertheless, Benavides estimates that more than 500,000 Indians have been converted, and now practice Catholicism with great devotion. Accompanying the report are two summaries in Italian: Ristretto della relatione del Nuovo Messico; and Relatione dele conversioni del Nuovo Messico, dated April 2, 1634. New Mexico 1634 Manuscripts.

Three letters written by Escalante between 1775\u20101776, concerning the difficulties of trying to convert the Moqui (Hopi) Indians and plans for an expedition to discover an overland route from New Mexico to Monterey. The first letter, dated November 7, 1775, is addressed to Father Fernando Gomez, secretary to the Franciscan provincial and includes a copy of Escalante\u2019s report to the governor on his June visit to the Hopis. He spent 8 days in the Hopi villages,\n84\nNew Mexico inspecting their homes, cattle, crops, methods of irrigation, and defense, and seeking information that might be useful for the expedition to California. In addition to finding an overland route to Monterey, the party hopes to establish presidios and missions near the Gila and Colorado Rivers, to find out more about the Spaniards living across the Colorado, and to convert more Indians. Escalante proposes a party of 20 men, including the engineer and cartographer Bernardo de Miera, and plans to go along himself, to offer spiritual assistance and to keep a detailed and accurate journal of the trip. In his letter of April 6, 1776 to Father Isidro Murillo, provincial of the Franciscan order in Mexico, Escalante describes the past failures of other missionaries to convert the Hopis using gentle tactics and non\u2010violent persuasion, and presents various arguments to justify using force. Escalante\u2019s third letter, dated April 30, 1776, is also addressed to Murillo, and includes a copy of the diary he kept during his visit to the Hopis from June 22\u2010July 5, 1775. Although the Hopis are sullen and difficult to convert, Escalante smokes a cigar with a friendly Havasupai Indian who draws him a map with charcoal on a saddle blanket. Escalante learns much about the terrain and people of the area and decides that the best route to Monterey is not through Hopi territory but through the Utes, father north. In Spanish. Butler, R.L.

Lizaula supports his petitions to the Supreme Court and the Treasury Department with copies of the original royal c\u00e9dula granting the pension; copies of the will and codicil of Gertrudis Andrade Moctezuma, establishing Lizaula as her legitimate son and heir; and testimony from various witnesses stating that do\u00f1a Gertrudis was the illegitimate child of Pedro Andrade Moctezuma and Margarita Belis.

Other documents, chiefly 19th century or 19th-century copies, include an engraved portrait of the Emperor Moctezuma; a genealogical table of the Mexican kings; baptismal records for Lizaula and other family members; wills of Diego Antonio Cano Moctezuma (1753), Pedro Andrade Moctezuma Mellado (1796) and Gertrudis Andrade Moctezuma (1824); copies of c\u00e9dulas and grants from Philip II, Cort\u00e9s, and viceroys Croix and Florez; and copies of reports, testimonies, and judicial proceedings requested by Lizaula from the Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n in Mexico City.

The princess rejoices in the safe arrival of the Archbishop in Mexico, which he described to her in his letter of Nov. 30, 1554. She emphasizes that the Indians must be well-treated by the clergy during their teaching and conversion, and that harmonious relations between the Crown and the ecclesiastical authories must be maintained. In addition, she is pleased that the Archbishop has designed a plan for a new cathedral in Mexico, which follows the design of the cathedral in Seville. The first part of the building will be constructed in a sumptuous and lavish style, and should be completed in 12 or 15 years. In conformity with a royal cedula, the Archbishop will report to the Viceroy and secure his agreement before going forward with the plans.

In his petition of March 16, directed to some high-ranking church or Inquisition official, Zum\u00e1rraga protests the unlawful actions of certain Augustinians in trying and sentencing cases of Indians accused of practicing idolatry, matters over which the Inquisition has exclusive jurisdiction. Zum\u00e1rraga accuses Fray Antonio Aguilar of using corporal punishment against certain Indians of the pueblo of Coquila\n90\nMexico who are worshipping idols, and asks that such practices be stopped and that the overzealous priest be sanctioned. Included with the petition is the confidential testimony of Anton Molero against Father Aguilar, in which Molero states that the priest found idols hidden by the Indians, along with a large quantity of clothing, and had ten or twelve Indians whipped in the marketplace and their idols publicly burned. There is also a fragment of a document of March 14, pertaining to a case against Juan de Visco on charges of scandalous language.

Letter, dated November 1537 in Mexico City, to Charles V from Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga, bishop of Mexico; Juan L\u00f3pez de Z\u00e1rate, bishop of Oaxaca; and Francisco Marroqu\u00edn, bishop of Guatemala, in which they discuss the problems they face preaching Catholicism among the Indians of New Spain. The bishops first request instructions from the king on attendance at the General Council. They then ask the king to facilitate Christianization of the Indians by authorizing the construction of roads and pueblos; by building churches to replace the temples and caves in which the Indians continue practicing their idolatry; and establishing convents and church schools where Indians can be educated. They point out the benefits of teaching the Indians how to farm and to perform other jobs. They also request more missionaries to be sent to New Spain, especially those well-trained in doctrine and theology. In view of the special problems the bishops face in New Spain, they ask for broader powers for themselves, such as filling benefice vacancies on a temporary basis. Other topics include requiring Indians to pay tithes or tribute to support the Church; imposing penalties on Indians for bigamy; allowing those Spaniards who have children by Indian women to remain in New Spain; standardizing baptismal rites and ceremonies; and using locally-produced holy oils, instead of oil shipped a great distance from Mexico City.

Having been instructed by the king, Charles V, to meet from time to time to discuss how best to govern their respective archdioceses, bishops Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga of Mexico, Juan de Z\u00e1rate of Oaxaca, and Vasco de Quiroga of Michoac\u00e1n, as well as various officials and members of the Franciscan, Dominican, and Augustinian orders gather in Tenochtitl\u00e1n (Mexico City) on April 27, 1539. The report contains the text of the king\u2019s instructions, followed by the 24 topics that were discussed and voted upon. These topics concern the administration of the sacraments of baptism, communion, and marriage to the Indians, the need for proper baptismal fonts, and the importance of following proper rites and ceremonies involving these sacraments. Christianized Indians must be taught when it is proper to kneel, to genuflect, or to beat one\u2019s breast. There is consensus that Indian festivals, dances, bonfires, burning of incense, and other ceremonies should be prohibited, and that Indian altars and places of worship should be destroyed. Church bells must be rung only for Christian services, and not as part of any Indian celebrations; Indian \"voladores,\" ceremonial performers who swing from high poles, are not permitted in church patios; and crosses are forbidden in Indian houses. The bishops also forbid the use of corporal punishment in converting the Indians. Other issues concern the construction of new churches; and the education of Indians in church schools. In addition to the signatures of the three bishops and the commisaries and provincials present at the meeting, the report bears the signature of Juli\u00e1n Garc\u00e9s, bishop of Tlaxcala.

The president and oidores of the Audiencia can grant repartimientos to those descendants of the first conquistadores who have no repartimiento and who need the income, the amount of the repartimiento--a portion of the tributes paid by the Indians--to be determined by need. In addition, when awarding repartimientos, the Audiencia should prefer children of the first conquistadores, and then descendants of early settlers. The ordinances establish residency requirements for those who have the use of Indian slaves of a certain province, as well as penalties for extracting excessively high taxes from the Indians. It is also illegal to do bodily harm to Indians, damage their property, or molest their wives and daughters, crimes punishable under the laws of the provinces.

Early mining laws of New Spain, formulated by the first viceroy Antonio de Mendoza in Mexico City in 1550. Mendoza\u2019s laws of 1550 are preceded by the texts of two other viceregal orders: the order of July 31, 1543 requires that all mines be registered, and establishes conditions under which a mine may be declared abandoned. A second order of March 13, 1548 revokes the previous one, and outlines new terms for registration and ownership of mines. The laws of 1550 deal with some of the problems not addressed in the earlier orders, especially the registration of mines. New miners were given provisional possession of a claim for three months, and registration was mandatory. The laws also describe how the mines were to be staked out; how ownership was to be determined, should more than one miner claim possession; and how adjacent mines were to be worked. The laws were promulgated in Mexico City, Taxco, Sultepec, and Zumpango, as well as in other mining areas of New Spain.\n94\nMexico Butler, R.L.

[278] leaves, bound ; 34 cm.\n97\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory Papers, dated 1567-1745, relating to various legal disputes over ownership and boundaries involving the Hacienda Santa In\u00e9s, acquired in 1608 by the Jesuits of the Colegio de Tepotzotl\u00e1n. The papers document the changing ownership of the lands in the pueblos of Jaltoc\u00e1n, Tultepec, Cuautitl\u00e1n, and Zumpango that made up the Hacienda Santa In\u00e9s. Titles to some parcels can be traced to the early mercedes or land grants of the viceroys, such as the grants of 1567 to Juan de Cuevas and Domingo Ximenez, the latter bearing the autograph signature of Gaston de Peralta, the marqu\u00e9s de Falces. Other parcels were acquired by the Colegio from Juan Antonio de Covarrubias, Pedro Hern\u00e1ndez de Alfaro and Carlos de Herrera, as indicated by various bills of sale and receipts for land payments. Several petitions from the numerous lawsuits in which the Colegio was involved list their land purchases, with location, date of acquisition, and previous owners. There is also an executory decree of July 10, 1571 from the Real Audiencia, upholding a decision in favor of the Indians of Zumpango in a case with the Indians of Jaltoc\u00e1n, over the boundaries of the estancia of Sacacomulco and a nearby lake, property which the Jesuits subsequently bought from the Indians of Zumpango. There are decisions in boundary disputes between the Colegio and an adjacent landowner Matheo Perez, and in cases of 1725 and 1745, between the Colegio and the Indians of Jaltoc\u00e1n. Financial statements of the Colegio for 1642 summarize its sources of income, such as livestock, wool, and grain; its expenditures, such as building repairs; and its outstanding debts.

Copy of a c\u00e9dula originally issued by Philip II in El Pardo, Spain on Dec. 5, 1590, granting mercedes to various members of the Moctezuma family. The c\u00e9dula, addressed to the viceroy of New Spain, Luis de Velasco, begins with genealogical information on Isabel Moctezuma, eldest daughter of the last Aztec emperor of Mexico, to whom Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s gave the village of Tacuba as a dowry. Although her first marriage, to Alonso Delgado, left no heirs, her second and third marriages--to Pedro Gallego and Juan Cano, respectively--\n101\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory resulted in ten children, all of whom share in the tax revenues from Tacuba. Because revenues from Tacuba have decreased, and because each child\u2019s share is so small, Isabel\u2019s heirs have requested additional mercedes from the king. The c\u00e9dula indicates the amount of additional annual income granted by the king to each of Isabel\u2019s descendants, and for how long, and whether or not it can be passed on to successive generations. The c\u00e9dula also authorizes treasury officials to make the payments from the Real Caja in Mexico City, and stipulates that these mercedes are final and that the family can make no further requests for money.

The king\u2019s c\u00e9dula of April 29, 1617 orders officials of the Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n in Seville to allow the servants of Pedro Cort\u00e9s, the marqu\u00e9s del Valle, to go to New Spain with him on the condition that they provide sworn statements testifying to their lineage and purity of bloodlines, and that the male servants listed as single certify that they are not presently married. A second royal c\u00e9dula of June 9, 1617 orders the juez oficial de Indias in C\u00e1diz to authorize passage of Cortes\u2019 servants to New Spain, since they have complied with the king\u2019s conditions of the earlier decree.

Statements from 1636 establish the legitimacy of Juan\u2019s birth, the nobility status granted to several of his relatives, and the services to the Crown performed by ancestors on both sides, one of whom was a conquistador and early settler of Nueva Vizcaya, and one of whom fought with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in the conquest of Mexico City and Pedro de Alvarado in Guatemala, for which services he was given a coat of arms. Other documents from 1517-1600 describe the heroic services of some of his wife\u2019s ancestors from the Ontiveros family, such as Diego de Ontiveros, who was killed fighting the Moors in Granada; and Crist\u00f3bal, who participated in the conquest of the Indies and helped pacify the Tepehuan Indians so that the mines near Zacatecas could be worked. Both Crist\u00f3bal, later one of the first cattle ranchers in Nueva Vizcaya, despite many hardships and risks, and his brother Juan, owner of the first gristmill in the area, helped open up the province to settlements. There is also a statement confirming the purity of\n104\nMexico family bloodlines which are free of Jewish or Moorish connections.

Report, probably from around 1654, by Ruiz Venegas, curate of the church in Michoac\u00e1n, in which he forwards to the viceroy suggestions for accomplishing the drainage of the area around Huehuetoca quickly, effectively, and economically. Ruiz Venegas, who spent 18 years in Huehuetoca, states that the only way to avoid flooding in the area is to drain the three lagoons of Coyotepeque, Zumpango, and San Crist\u00f3bal, formed by the confluence of the Cuatitl\u00e1n and Pachuca Rivers. Although the existing dikes help somewhat, they constantly need repair and, furthermore, are unreliable. To carry off all the water that must be drained, he suggests widening the gap cut through the mountains in Huehuetoca, 8 leagues from Mexico City, a project begun in 1607 by engineer and entrepreneur Enrico Mart\u00ednez. Ruiz Venegas\u2019 recommendations include hiring the best expert, not necessarily a Spaniard, to oversee the project; putting the local Indian caciques in charge of the Indian workers in their respective jurisdictions; paying the workers a salary of 2 reales a day plus living expenses; setting a deadline for completion of the project; and offering incentives and prizes for special achievements by the workers. He believes that by eliminating the multitude of supervisors and administrators, the government can save a considerable amount of money. In addition, if the Indians themselves are in charge of the project, they will work more quickly and with greater commitment. Ruiz also proposes that the local magistrate hear cases involving the workers, instead of a specially-appointed judge; and that a priest be paid 60 pesos per month to administer the sacraments to the workers.

The second letter, dated October 30, 1520, is an account of Cort\u00e9s\u2019 efforts to conquer the Aztecs by capturing their ruler Montezuma and occupying the capital city of Temixtitan. Despite an initial victory over the Indians, Cort\u00e9s and his men are defeated during \"la noche triste,\" with many Spaniards and Indian allies killed and treasure lost. Cort\u00e9s also includes many details on the customs, religion, and dwellings of the Aztecs, and describes the great marketplace, aqueducts, and sacrificial pyramids of Temixtitan. The third letter, from May 15, 1522, continues Cort\u00e9s\u2019 narration of the conquest and recovery of Temixtitan. Capitalizing on the dissension among the various Indian lords, Cort\u00e9s succeeds in re-taking the city and subjugating rivals Texcoco, Tacuba, and Cuernavaca; and begins to build a new Spanish city on the ruins of the Aztec capital. He also sends some of his men on expeditions to explore and claim possession of the Pacific Ocean. Cort\u00e9s\u2019 \"memorial\" to Carlos V is an itemized list of his accomplishments and services performed for the Crown, in which Cort\u00e9s complains to the king of mistreatment and erosion of his powers, especially by the viceroy Antonio de Mendoza. He asks the king to remember his promises, to restore anything that might be taken from him, and to make restitution for damages suffered.

On Aug. 31, 1751, in response to Father Joseph Gonz{lez\u2019s petition for tax monies, viceroy Revillagigedo finally orders the local magistrate to submit estimates on the cost of rebuilding the church, as well as names of businessmen and landowners of the parish capable of contributing additional money. On Sept. 13, 1752, Andreu recommends to the viceroy that he designate one-fourth of Teposcolula\u2019s tax revenues for five years for church construction. In his order of September 26, 1752, the viceroy accepts the vote of the Audiencia ministers of the Real Acuerdo to seek a third expert opinion on the necessity and costs of completely rebuilding the church. Although mayor Giraud submits all requested information through March 20, 1753, no further action on the matter is taken until November 24, 1755, when the new fiscal, Luis Francisco Mosquera y Pimentel, the marqu\u00e9s de Aranda, reissues the recommendation of his predecessor in office.

Petitions, reports, and official responses from 1750 to 1753, concerning the request to the archbishop of Puebla from the curate of Zacatl\u00e1n, Agust\u00edn Ort\u00edz de Espinosa, to construct two churches in the parishes of Xicolapa and Thomatl\u00e1n. The bishop, Domingo Pantaleon Alvarez approves Espinosa\u2019s request of Oct. 20, 1750, but before work on the churches can be completed, a counter petition is filed by certain Indians of Zacatl\u00e1n, complaining that the new churches are not necessary and protesting the presence of Dominican priests in the area. They state that the Indians are too poor to pay for the buildings and to contribute to the maintenance of the priests. When the Indians create disturbances during Mass, Espinosa wants the army to intervene and pacify the dissenters using force. Many Indian families abandon the settlements in fear of punishment. Papers from October 1750-March 1753 document the ongoing negotiations on the matter among the viceroy, Revillagigedo; his fiscal Andreu; the bishop of Puebla; Father Espinosa; and various municipal officials from Zacatl{n. Andreu\u2019s final recommendation of March 23, 1753, approved by the viceroy on March 24, supports the construction of the churches, and points out that the one church yet to be built will cost only 100 pesos. Andreu suggests that the costs be paid from present church funds, to be paid back at a later time. In Spanish.\n109\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory\nButler, R.L.

Petitions from clergymen and official responses from the viceroy and fiscal dated 1750-1777, concerning the use of tax monies for completion of a new church in Chalcatongo and for purchase of church ornaments in Atoyaque del Mariscal. In his petition to Viceroy Revillagigedo of February 3, 1750, Juan Antonio Carri\u00f3n, curate of Chalcatongo, requests that a portion of the tax\n112\nMexico money for that district be allocated to complete construction of the parish church. A marginal note from the fiscal, Antonio Andreu from March 12, 1750, seeks more information from the bishop on the situation. Also included is a statement from the alcalde mayor of Teposcolula, Joseph Hita Salazar, verifying the deplorable state of the church and the poverty of the few residents, and recommending financial assistance for the project from the viceroy. A second petition from 1777 from Jos\u00e9 Mariano del Rosal requests that the viceroy authorize reimbursement from municipal funds for his client, Francisco Perez Persaval, who provided certain furnishings and ornaments for the church in Atoyaque. Documents related to this request include an inventory of furnishings, dated October 23, 1776, by Father Mariano Cesario Le\u00f3n of the district of Santa Cruz in the Oaxaca diocese, verifying their presence in the Atoyaque church; and an October 30, 1776 statement of costs incurred by Father Persaval from tailor Manuel de Estrada for work on the Atoyaque church ornaments. The final statement of fiscal Arangoyti, dated January 28, 1777, recommends that the outstanding debt to Persaval for the furnishings be paid from community revenues, and warns citizens not to incur such debts in the future without special permission. Viceroy Bucareli\u2019s autograph signature of January 31, 1777 confirms the recommendation.

Copy of Cort\u00e9s\u2019 letter of May 15, 1522 to the Spanish king, Carlos V, containing an account of the conquest and recovery of the Aztec capital of Temixtitan (now Mexico City), the subjugation of other Indian tribes, and expeditions to the Pacific Ocean. Cort\u00e9s summarizes parts of his second letter of 1520 to the king, and then describes how the Spaniards, initially defeated by the Indians, succeeded in conquering the Aztecs, capturing their rulers, and taking the great city of Temixtitan. Although the Spaniards were forced to contest with treachery from within their own ranks, Cort\u00e9s\u2019 desire for revenge, his careful planning of the siege of Temixtitan, and his exploitation of the rifts and disloyalties among the various Indian tribes enabled him to defeat the Aztecs as well as other tribes Texcoco, Tacuba, and Cuernavaca, and to begin rebuilding a Spanish city on the ruins of the Aztec capital. Cort\u00e9s also includes a brief discussion of the expeditions made by his men to discover the Mar del Sur or the Pacific Ocean and to take possession of it in the king\u2019s name.

A ms. copy of P\u00e9rez de Ribas\u2019 history of the Jesuits and their evangelistic work in Mexico, from 1572 to 1624. The first Jesuits arrived in Veracruz, Mexico, on June 13, 1572, to begin their evangelistic enterprise in the New World, and P\u00e9rez de Ribas documents the founding of the numerous Jesuit colleges which sprang up in Mexico in cities such as Valladolid, Oaxaca, Puebla, P\u00e1tzcuaro, and Mexico City. There is also a section on the establishment of Jesuit mission in the Philippines. P\u00e9rez describes the triumphs and miraculous conversions of the Jesuit missionaries, as well as their persecutions, devoting several chapters to the great disputes between the Jesuits and bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza; and includes much biographical material on Jesuit priests, missionaries, and on important officials, such as Alonso de Villaseca, founder of the Colegio de Mexico; Melchor de Covarrubias, founder of the Colegio del Esp\u00edritu Santo in Puebla; Alonso de la Mota y Escobar, bishop of Puebla and founder of the Colegio de San Ildefonso; and Vasco de Quiroga, first bishop of Michoac\u00e1n.

Copy made in 1852 by Mariano Macedo of parts of Mu\u00f1oz Camargo\u2019s history of Tlaxcala, from the ms. owned at that time by Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta. Book I recounts the early history of Tlaxcala of the 11th and 12th centuries; the establishment of the centers at Tepect\u00edcpac, Ocotelulco, Tizatl\u00e1n, and Quiahuiztl\u00e1n; and the ongoing wars with the Aztecs, especially under Moctezuma Ilhuicamina. Mu\u00f1oz Camargo also describes important Tlaxcalan heroes such as the great warrior Tlahuicole and the rulers, Xicot\u00e9ncatl, father and son. There are chapters on the culture and social customs of the Tlaxcalans, and on their religion, including details on the priests, idols, and human sacrifices. Book II begins with the arrival of the Spaniards in Mexico, and the role of the Tlaxcalans as allies of Cort\u00e9s in his conquest of the Aztec empire. With the coming of the first Franciscans missionaries, Indian gods such as Camaxtli are denounced and their temples destroyed. The chronicle continues with accounts of new explorations and discoveries in New Mexico and California following the Conquest; the political and ecclesiastical organization of the colony; and the achievements of the early viceroys, concluding in 1585 as the 5th viceroy, the marqu\u00e9s de Villamanrique, takes office.

The record of the proceedings to confirm the nobility of Juan, Mar\u00eda, and Petrona Xiu, including testimony of witnesses and the \"auto de permisi\u00f3n,\" is dated May 13, 1641 in Tekax. The bulk of the documents are petitions by members of the Xiu family who, on the basis of their nobility status, seek hereditary rights, privileges, and exemptions. Petitions are filed by members of successive generations, such as Alonso Xiu, his widow Catalina Cim\u00e9, their children Juan, Mar\u00eda, and Petrona, and their grandsons Bonifacio Uc and Roque Xiu. Certifications of baptism often accompany these petitions for privileges. The Man\u00ed land treaty of 1557 is a land survey of the province of Man\u00ed. Also included are two pictorial documents: one is a pictorial map of the Tutul Xiu province of Man\u00ed from 1577, showing the surrounding towns and villages--their names inscribed within a circle topped by a cross--linked by roads to larger municipalities designated by small drawings of churches. The other is a 17th-century Xiu family tree of nine generations, shown arising from the loins of a Maya Indian, Hun-Uitzil-Chac, accompanied by his wife.

There is also an order of August 26, 1760 requesting parties involved in a land dispute to produce their legal title to the property in question. Several documents pertain to a lawsuit between a group of Indians and the landowner Buenaventura Gutierrez, including a map showing the location of his land and the names of the boundary markers. The final ruling, handed down in Merida on July 22, 1761 by the governor, determines the papers held by the Indians to have been falsified, and the title to the property held by Gutierrez to be valid. The governor also orders that Gutierrez\u2019s boundary markers be properly registered, and that he be protected from any disturbances on his property.

The excerpts outline some of the reasons for low revenues from these two provinces, such as dry farmland, few rivers, and lack of mineral resources. In addition, most of the inhabitants of the peninsula are Indians, who produce little for the local economy, consume even less, and do not pay taxes. Widespread smuggling and illicit trade also undermine the economy and reduce revenues for the Crown, a problem which could be solved by establishing free trade between Spain and her colonies, eliminating or lowering some tariffs, and creating a vigilant coast guard. The report lists the principal crops and resources of the peninsula which, with some stimulation and under the proper conditions, could be developed as important commercial products, such as logwood, cochineal and other dyes, lumber, drugs and medicinal herbs, beeswax and honey, salt, and manufactured items such as cotton cloth, leather, and hemp rope. There is also a section on income from ecclesiastical taxes, and a summary of the financial situation of various religious institutions in Campeche, M\u00e9rida, and Valladolid.

[ca. 1768] [15] leaves ; 25 cm. Undated, anonymous report to the governor of the province of Yucat\u00e1n, concerning abuses of the Indians by the clergy, probably written sometime after 1768, when the Jesuits had been expelled from Mexico and the Franciscans had been given control over the missions. The writer, who speaks from his long experience of 38 years in the province, reports that although royal decrees expressly forbid clergy--both secular and regular--from forcing the Indians to pay church taxes or forcing them to leave their property to the Church when they die, such ecclesiastical abuses are prevalent. He lists the numerous items that a typical man and wife are required to pay for the normal upkeep of the convent and clergy, including special assessments for religious societies, marriages, baptisms, funerals, and wills. The Franciscan priests oppress the Indians by requiring many other kinds of payments, which the Indians escape by abandoning their villages and living in the mountains. The writer suggests a more equitable system of collecting taxes, to avoid discord and competition between the priests and friars, and to maintain not only the convents and clergy, but also the presidio at Campeche, vital to the defense of the peninsula. In addition, the Indians would be treated less harshly and would return to their villages. Butler, R.L. Check list of the mss. in the Ayer Coll., 1107 Photocopy.

Fragment of a colored pictograph ms., showing the defeat and assassination by\n160\nMexico the Aztec Motecuhzoma Ilhuicamina of Macatl, a chieftain of Azcapotzalco during the Tepanec War of 1428 A.D. The two warriors are shown fighting with shield, bow and arrows, and spear.

Autograph diary of Father Taraval, containing an account in 324 numbered paragraphs of various Indian uprisings in Baja California between 1734 and 1737. Taraval, rector of the mission of Santa Rosa, describes the Indian hostilities encountered by the Jesuit missionaries who sought to settle and Christianize the area. His journal begins in July 1734 with rumors of impending revolt among the Peric\u00faes and Huchit\u00edes. By Oct. 6, 1734, he and some loyal Callajue Indian followers had fled to the island of Esp\u00edritu Santo, after having received word of the massacre of two other Jesuit priests, Lorenzo Carranco and Nicol\u00e1s Tamaral at the Santiago and San Jos\u00e9ph missions, respectively. With Captain Estevan Rodr\u00edguez Lorenzo, an experienced Indian fighter, Father Taraval decides to return to La Paz and establish military headquarters there from which to deal with the rebels. Unfortunately, when other Indian hostilities jeopardize the San Ignacio mission in the north, La Paz is abandoned in Jan. 1735. The journal documents ongoing skirmishes in Mission Dolores area\n165\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory during 1735, and the arrival of soldiers and Yaqui Indians under the command of Manuel Huidobro in December. Taraval recounts Huidobro\u2019s ineffectual policies of dealing with the rebels during 1736, as well as his own attempts to restore Mission San Joseph. The journal ends in Jan. 1737, as leading rebels are captured and banished. At paragraph 248, Taraval includes \"Programma chronologicum\" of the lives of the martyrs Carranco and Tamaral.

Report by Felipe de Neve, most likely addressed to the viceroy and dated September 12, 1774 in Mexico City, containing his recommendations for improving control of the administration and finances of the missions in the California peninsula. Neve, who at the time was administrator of the former Jesuit Colegio de San Luis de Gonzaga, and about to be named officially as governor of the Californias, describes the ongoing friction between Franciscan and Dominican missionary priests and colonial officials. He notes allegations of the priests\u2019 mistreatment and exploitation of the Indians, who often leave the missions to live in the mountains on roots and wild fruits. As a result, agricultural and livestock production have been very low. Furthermore, although G\u00e1lvez, the visitor general, has ordered each mission to register the cultivated land under its supervision, the clergy refuse to comply, thus preserving their autonomy from the viceroy and their control over the Indians. Neve recommends that the government regulate and increase cattle and crop production by appointing an official mayordomo to oversee the work of the Indians in the fields. To increase colonial revenues, he also encourages the development of other products such as salt, aromatic gum, tortoise shell, pearls,\n166\nBaja California and silver. He concludes by nominating Bernardo Moreno y Castro to serve as a visiting examiner of mission operations, and suggests that another official be named to coordinate the mayordomos, and to keep records of annual harvests and the sale and distribution of crops. Finally, as there is no circulating currency in the peninsula, he recommends that 8,000-10,000 pesos be allocated to the government of Loreto, the capital of Baja California to pay mineworkers and government officials.\nVAULT Ayer MS 1096\nCompendio hist\u00f3rico y cronol\u00f3gico que demuestra el descubrimiento del Mar del Sur y delas Californias, hecho por los espa\u00f1oles [manuscript] : y asimismo el fundamento que asiste a Espa\u00f1a, para excluir a todas las naciones dela navegaci\u00f3n delos mares de Indias, y de establecerse y comerciar en ellas ... / formado de Rl.

There is an introduction describing the archives from which the documents were taken, and four sections, each arranged chronologically: the first section contains excerpts from royal decrees and administrative reports authorizing explorations of the Pacific coast of North Americaal by Vizcayno and Portel Casanete and approving settlements and missionary work in California by Ascensi\u00f3n, Kino, and Salvatierra as a means of preventing other countries from getting a foothold in the Pacific. The other three sections present excerpts from orders, decrees, council decisions and laws which declare Spain\u2019s exclusive right to the seas of the Indies, forbidding navigation and trade with the Indies by other countries and preventing English and Dutch ships from sailing around the Cape of Good Hope. The appendix cites trade agreements between the Spanish and the French against the English. Butler, R.L.

Chronological account, dated 1799 in Mexico, of various explorations by navigators of the Spanish royal navy along the Pacific coast of California, British Columbia, and Alaska, between 1768 and 1796. The narrator, an anonymous naval officer, opens with a short history of the California peninsula, its discovery by Cort\u00e9s in 1536, the explorations of Ulloa and Coronado, the early missionary work of Fathers Kino, Salvatierra, Piccolo, and Ugarte, and the customs, dress, and religion of the Indians. He describes the missions and presidios established in 1768 at San Diego and Monterrey, and documents 3 expeditions from San Blas, Mexico. The first was commissioned by Viceroy Bucareli in 1773 to explore the Pacific coast as far north as Nootka, near Vancouver, and to determine the extent of Russian settlements in the area. Explorations to Bucareli Bay and Prince William Sound in Alaska continued in 1775 and 1776 under Ezeta, Perez, Mart\u00ednez, and Bodega. There is a discussion of the Spanish settlement at Nootka, and, following seizure of English ships by the Spanish, the agreement of 1790 between the two countries concerning boundaries, fishing, and trade. Also included is an appendix of related documents, containing instructions of various viceroys to the expedition leaders; provisions for the evacuation of Nootka by the Spanish in 1795; treaties; letters to the viceroy from Thomas Muir, a Scot seeking protection; and 2 vocabulary lists of terms used by the Indians in the area of the Prince William Sound and by the Nootka Indians.

Copy, most likely from around 1801, of Galvez\u2019s essay on the nature of Apache warfare, with recommendations for improving the fighting ability of colonial forces. The author describes Apache characteristics which make them such strong fighters, such as their stoicism, speed and agility, and their beliefs in an afterlife which rewards bravery. In contrast, soldiers stationed in the garrisons to fight the Apaches are not as fast and agile and view death in battle from a different perspective. Furthermore, they lack the strength of the Apaches, who can endure cold, hunger and thirst for long periods of time. In addition, Apaches are uniquely motivated, for as they neither farm nor raise cattle, they attack in order to steal, and thus to subsist. G\u00e1lvez admires how the Apaches choose their leader solely for his bravery and obey him without question during combat; how they travel light, riding at night through the high rocky terrain so as not to leave tracks or lose their strategic position; and how they attack swiftly, terrorizing their victims with their cries, and then escape quickly. He criticizes the soldiers who are slow, carry too much heavy gear, and travel down on the plains, where they are visible and vulnerable. He recommends that the regiments use more auxiliary Indians than soldiers; keep horses in better condition and not overload them; provide the soldiers with good firearms and powder and teach them how to handle them skillfully; use the best and bravest soldiers, regardless of race; and appoint commanders who will treat their soldiers well and with good discipline. In conclusion, he provides a list of friendly Indian tribes with comments on their character and their strengths and weaknesses as fighters. See Anales del Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda (Mexico : 1925), Series 4, Vol. III, p. 537-549 for a published version of the text, with notes by Felipe Teixidor, who suggests that G\u00e1lvez wrote this essay sometime between June 1785 and November 1786, when he was viceroy of New Spain.

Bernardo Miera y Pacheco to Joseph de G\u00e1lvez, prime minister to the Spanish king, Charles III, concerning the exploration and settlement of New Mexico. Miera first points out the importance of exploring and developing the coast of California, in order to assure Spain\u2019s control of the northwest territory and to convert the Indian tribes to Christianity. He argues that once the problems of hostile Indians in the province of Gila are eliminated, setttlements should be established without delay. Miera, now 64 years old and a veteran of many Indian campaigns and mapping expeditions, has left Santa Fe for San Felipe del Real de Chiguagua, where he has been waiting 6 months to petition the commandant general for a salaried command in the New Mexico militia. He expresses the hope that such an influential and noble minister as G\u00e1lvez will intercede on his behalf. In conclusion, Miera advises that since the northern territory of New Spain is harsh and undesirable, threatened by dangerous Apaches and Comanches who are unwilling to be converted, Spain should concentrate her efforts in opening up and populating the western lands, which offer better opportunities for Christianizing the Indians and exploiting the great mineral wealth there.

[293] leaves, bound ; 32 cm. Father Morfi\u2019s diary account from August 4, 1777 to Nov. 9, 1778 of his expedition with Teodoro de Croix to inspect and report on the state of the northern frontier provinces of Mexico. As newly\u2010appointed commandant of the Provincias Internas, Croix organized the expedition to gain a first\u2010hand\n174\nChihuahua knowledge of the territory he was to oversee. The expedition left Mexico City on August 4, 1777, and headed northwest through Quer\u00e9taro, San Miguel de Allende, and Durango, then east to the presidio of San Juan Bautista. They traveled as far as San Antonio de B\u00e9jar in Texas before turning west towards Coahuila. The ms. ends on Nov. 9, 1778, as the group arrives in Chihuahua. Morfi discusses the geography and terrain of the area, as well as its agriculture, livestock, cattle, mineral resources, flora and fauna. He describes each town along the route, the distances travelled, and provides details on the construction of the presidios, missions, and convents. He is particularly critical of the powerful, often absentee landowners of the great haciendas, whom he blames for much of the poverty and misery of the New World and the many abuses of the Indians in the fields and mines. He also discusses the Indians he encounters in the pueblos, their nature and customs. The ms. contains material not included in the published versions, such as a letter by Fray Juan Larios, a brief report on the province of Texas, and a detailed description of Chiguagua (Chihuahua), its geography, agriculture, and mining operations.

Unsigned summary, probably from late 1778 or 1779, of recommendations and actions taken from April 15\u2010December 3, 1778, concerning the formation of volunteer militias to patrol the Parral region against hostile Indians. The author begins with a summary of a report dated April 15, 1778 in San Felipe del Real de Chiguagua, outlining suggestions for establishing volunteer militias to be known as Compa\u00f1\u00edas voluntarias de dragones provinciales de San Carlos, with\n175\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory advice on the location of these companies; their funding through contributions and municipal revenues; the organization of their command; and budgets for arms, horses, uniforms, and salaries. Other official correspondence on this subject from April 6\u2010Dec. 3, 1778 is also described. There is a short history of Parral, covering its early establishment in 1631, the abandonment of its mines around 1718, and its subsequent resurgence in 1748. Also included is a summary of the correspondence from Dec. 23, 1777\u2010Sept. 20, 1778 with the alcalde mayor of Parral on the militias; and a description of the request of April 6, 1778 made by the residents and curate of Parral to the district government for relief of the ongoing hostilities with neighboring Indians which they have endured for the past eight years.

The petition to Viceroy Bucareli, dated November 20, 1776 and signed by 18 Ayuntamiento members, asks for an increase of the 66 pesos from municipal funds designated by law for the celebration of such feasts. The response of Francisco Antonio de Gallarreta of the accounting department for municipal finances (Contadur\u00eda de Proprios), dated December 3, 1776 in Mexico City, suggests an allowance of 110 pesos for the celebration. However, the state\u2019s attorney, Domingo de Arrangoyti, submits a final recommendation of 100 pesos on December 7, 1776, which is confirmed by Bucareli on December 10, 1776.

On January 21, 1809, judge Nicol\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez Rinc\u00f3n orders that their petition be reviewed by the ecclesiastical tribunal of Dolores, and on February 25, 1809, by the promotor fiscal or attorney general for Church matters. Included with the petition are testimonies of residents in support of the project, as well as statements from the alcaldes of the towns of\n177\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory San Luis de la Paz, San Luis Potos\u00ed, and Santiago del R\u00edo. Other documents verify sources of funding for the convent, and include Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s transfer of title of the building he is donating. In addition, various landowners pledge to contribute a percentage of their annual income for the maintenance of the convent. The case is approved by the fiscal for Church matters on November 11, 1809 and confirmed by diocesan officials. There are two copies of these proceedings, signed by clerk Rafael Aragon on December 14 and 15, 1809. The report of the state\u2019s attorney, signed by Ambrosio de Sagarzurieta in Mexico City on January 31, 1810, raises seven questions about the proposal, such as the reliability of the donors to fulfill their pledges; the jurisdiction under which the convent would function; and social problems that might result from mixing Indian and Spanish nuns. Also included is a statement by Miguel Bachiller y Mena, legal advisor to the viceroy, dated in Mexico City on April 9, 1810, indicating further steps to be taken to continue the case. Butler, R.L.

[12] leaves ; 31 cm. Copy of various documents, dated in Mexico City on April 18, 1589, pertaining to the encomiendas of Margarita de Legaspi and her sister, Teresa Garc\u00e9s in Izmiquilpa and Zumpango. Margarita and Teresa, daughters of the deceased governor of the Philippines, Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legaspi, have each been granted, by a c\u00e9dula of May 12, 1580, the right to 1000 ducats a year, to be collected by\n181\nMexico State Margarita from tributes of the pueblo of Yzmiquilpa, and by Teresa from the tributes of Zumpango. A subsequent determination of the Real Audiencia, dated April 10, 1583, rescinds the grants. Although the Royal Treasury orders them to pay back all the money they have collected thus far, Margarita contends that they were entitled to collect income during the time of the litigation, and owe the Crown only money collected after the final judicial decision was rendered in 1583. The Crown agrees to compensate the sisters for the overpayment, minus deductions for the doctrinal instruction of the Indians, church maintenance, and the diezmo, costs which all encomenderos customarily pay to the Crown. In addition to financial accounts of taxes received and payments previously made to the treasury, the documents include the texts of various petitions, the c\u00e9dula of 1580 granting the merced of the tributes; the carta executoria rescinding the grant; the denial of the appeal; and the final tabulation of the Crown\u2019s return payment to the sisters.

Compendium of 27 documents from 1743\u20101789 requesting permission to establish a Capuchin convent for Indian nuns in the parish of San Mateo Jalatlaco in the archdiocese of Antequera (now Oaxaca de Ju\u00e1rez). The papers document the formal proceedings, initiated in 1743 by a group of local Indian caciques and continued by members of the Cofrad\u00eda de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Patrocinio, to seek the approval required by law of church and state authorities to found the convent, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Patrocinio, for Indian women of good lineage and daughters of caciques. Documents include the diligencias or judicial formalities begun in 1743; a list from 1743 of caciques and their towns; related petitions (several bearing the autograph signatures of viceroys Croix and Bucareli), testimony from neighboring parishes, and powers of attorney from 1750\u20101789; copies of c\u00e9dulas reales: one from 1697 permitting Indians to enter convents and hold ecclesiastical offices, and one from 1768, allocating 2000 pesos for the construction of the convent. A status report requested by the\n183\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory viceroy from the bishop of Antequera, dated July 12, 1777, indicates that the construction of the convent is well under way. Other documents concern funding: there is a letter of June 30, 1777 to viceroy Bucareli from the archbishop of Antequera, asking that the 2000 pesos promised to the convent building fund be released; a notice of August 8, 1777 from the Real Caja de M\u00e9xico requesting official confirmation of the order before payment of the 2000 pesos can be made; and the fiscal\u2019s letter of August 29, 1777 to the king, approved and signed by viceroy Bucareli, also seeking release of the funds.

The viceroy, Mart\u00edn de Mayorga, accepts the advice of his fiscal, Manuel Mart\u00edn Merino, on Feb. 23, 1780, and agrees to hear testimony in the case. Included are the official \u02baobedicimiento\u02ba of March 6, 1780 by the district administrator, Josef Mar\u00eda Vayeto; statements from various residents of Huautla and from the curate of Tlaquiltenango; and a letter of Oct. 9, 1780 from the archbishop, Alonso Nu\u00f1ez de Haro y Peralta. After reading the testimony, the fiscal recommends that the license be granted, and the viceroy signs the opinion on Feb. 7, 1781. In conclusion, Riofr\u00edo and Borunda follow up with a second petition to the viceroy of April 1782, in which they ask him to execute the order to build, which had officially been granted to Samper in a royal c\u00e9dula of Oct. 25, 1781.

Contemporary ms. copy of Rodr\u00edguez Gallardo\u2019s report of 1750 on problems in the provinces of Sinaloa and Sonora. Rodr\u00edguez Gallardo was commissioned in January 1748 by Viceroy Revillagigedo to investigate the causes of the deterioration of the northeastern provinces of Sinaloa and Sonora. As juez pesquisidor and visitador general of the two provinces, Rodr\u00edguez Gallardo began an extensive journey throughout Sinaloa and Sonora, adquiring a first\u2010 hand knowledge of their geography, population, government, currency, commerce, and production. In his Informe of 1750, he discusses the four principal causes for the decline of the provinces: their dependence on inadequate and inefficient overland routes for trade and commerce; few, if any, settled areas, villages, or presidios, with vast areas left unpopulated, thus encouraging ongoing hostility of Indians, especially the Apaches; no circulating legal tender, resulting in confusion and abuses in prices, and the inability to collect taxes; and finally, an unwieldy and mismanaged government, incapable of administering such a vast extension of territory, with control scattered among various missions, municipalities, militias, and mining companies. Rodr\u00edguez Gallardo also suggests solutions to correst these problems, such as the development and expansion of faster, more efficient commercial sea routes; the introduction and use of a standard currency; and the division of the provincial government into two parts for easier management. This ms. copy has no title page, and is undated and unsigned. Mexico 1750 Manuscripts. Born in Campeche, Mexico, around 1716\u20101718, he received a Jesuit education and studied religion and law in Mexico City. He worked as a lawyer, gaining expertise in mission and presidio affairs, and in 1748 was named investigative judge for the northeastern provinces by viceroy Revillagigedo. While werving as contador de tributos, he was implicated in a plot against the archbishop of Mexico and was exiled to Spain in 1769. After a lengthy process of exoneration, Rodr\u00edguez Gallardo returned to Mexico in 1774, where he died in 1781. In Spanish. Butler, R.L.

Ms. copy of a report, dated May 16, 1770, in \u00c1lamos, to the viceroy of New Spain, the marqu\u00e9s de Croix, from Eusebio Bentura Bele\u00f1a, the subdelegate of visitor general Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez, concerning the collection of tributes, land division, and other legal matters in the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa. Bele\u00f1a informs the viceroy of the past history and procedures for the collection of tributes in the northern frontier provinces of Sinaloa and Sonora, formerly known as Nueva Andaluc\u00eda. He describes the boundaries and the alcald\u00edas mayores within the provinces, and points out that although taxes are levied in other areas, they have never been collected in Sinaloa or Sonora (with the exception of Culiac\u00e1n) because they were considered frontier provinces. He supports Galvez\u2019s proposal to tax the Indians and outlines the legal basis for doing so. Bele\u00f1a also favors organizing the Indians who inhabit the areas around the Sinaloa, Mayo, Fuerte, and Yaqui rivers into formal parishes, granting them ownership of land, and collecting tributes. In order to put an end to the Indian rebellions in these provinces which have been an ongoing problem since 1751\u201052, Bele\u00f1a recommends that the Indians be disarmed and that provincial militias be created.

[7] leaves ; 30 cm. Unsigned report, dated June 17, 1771 in Mexico City, on the successful results of a recent military campaign in Sonora and Sinaloa to pacify the Indians. Although the two provinces constitute one of the richest mineral areas of Mexico, the continuing raids and massacres by the Seris, Piatos, and Sibubapas have caused many of the settlers to abandon their homes and work in the mining districts there. Although troops have been sent in, the Indians constantly elude them and hide in remote areas of the craggy terrain. Finally, in 1768, a company of 100 volunteers from Spain forces the Indians to surrender. The provincial government promises to insure control of the mining sites which attract thousands of prospectors, such as the recently\u2010discovered gold deposits at Cieneguilla and the gold and silver mines at Aguas Fr\u00edas and Cornelio. In addition to assigning priests and judges to the various sites to maintain order and tranquility, a mint has been established to produce a circulating currency needed to conduct commerce. Finally, in response to requests from peaceful tribes such as the Papagos, Nijoras and Opas, 10 missionary priests are being sent from the Colegio de la Santa Cruz in Quer\u00e9taro. Now the only obstacle to the development and defense of the northern area are the Apaches, who terrorize the province of Nueva Vizcaya. Once they are expelled from the province, a line of internal presidios can be built to defend the Spanish settlers, as recommended by the Marqu\u00e9s de Rub\u00ed on his recent tour of inspection.

Copy of a report, possibly to Viceroy Bucareli, by Fray Antonio Mar\u00eda de los Reyes, on the status of the missions in the province of Sonora administered by the Franciscan missionaries of the Colegio de la Santa Cruz in Quer\u00e9taro. Reyes briefly describes the early explorations of Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n in 1531 and Francisco de Ibarra in 1563, and discusses Viceroy Croix\u2019s commission to the Franciscans to evangelize Sonora and assume control of the missions left by the Jesuits after their expulsion from Mexico in 1767. He details the hardships that the missionaries must face, such as hostile Indians and a widely\u2010scattered population, with no formal Spanish settlements. He points out the many abuses of the Indians: settlers seize the best lands, often forcing out Indians already there. Merchants manipulate markets, so that the Indians must sell their crops cheaply but must buy at artifically high prices. Indians are regularly bribed and exploited with mescal, the manufacture of which has been outlawed. Missionaries and church officials often abuse the Indians by making them perform hard labor for little or no pay. Reyes also describes the explorations of 1770 and 1771 by Fray Francisco Garc\u00e9s from San Xavier del Bac north to the Gila and Colorado Rivers, and emphasizes the need to send more missionaries to this remote region where the Indians seem eager to embrace Catholicism.

However, now Apaches, aided by disgruntled Pimas, have encroached as far as the presidio of San Miguel Horcasitas, raiding the pueblos of Los R\u00edos, Oposuna, Sonora, and Opodepe. On Oct. 5, 1773, Apaches attacked the mission at Banamiche, stealing cattle, horses, and mules from the corrals.

In another attack on Oct. 11 at Dolores, horses and mules were stolen and 17 Yaquis, panning for gold nearby, were killed.

Manuscript copy of Avendano\u2019s account, dated April 29, 1696, of his two trips to the Yucat\u00e1n and Guatemala during 1695\u20101696. Avendano, Father Perez de San Roman, and a large group of Spanish and Indian musketeers leave M\u00e9rida on June 2, 1695, and begin their journey south, for the purpose of converting the Itza Indians, and opening a highway route between the Yucat\u00e1n and Guatemala. The first expedition returns to M\u00e9rida on September 16, 1695 because of problems with the soldiers who persisted in shooting and robbing the Indians. After receiving word in December 1695 that the Itzas were now ready to receive Christianity, a second expedition, led by Avendano, and Fathers Perez, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, and Echavarria, follows the same route south to the province of Pet\u00e9n in Guatemala. Avendano describes the nature of the Indians, their social life, religion, and calendar. He also mentions the problems that the priests face from the soldiers in their own party, from hostile Itza chiefs, and from difficult terrain and lack of food. After a miraculous rescue from near death, Avendano returns to M\u00e9rida on April 6, 1696. Born in Spain, Avendano later settled in the Yucat\u00e1n, where he achieved preeminence in the Franciscan order there. He wrote several linguistic works (none of which was ever published), including an extensive Mayan dictionary and a study of medical botany. Excerpts from his Relaci\u00f3n de las dos entradas were published in Madrid in 1701, as part of Villagutierre\u2019s Historia de la conquista de la provincia de el Itza. Butler, R.L.

Contemporary copy of a report of July 12, 1766 by the deputy visitor and the chief accountant for the province of Yucat\u00e1n, containing an extensive description of the agriculture, commerce, industry, and tax system of the province. The report is most likely addressed to the visitor general of New Spain, Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez, by whom it was apparently commissioned at San Juan de Ul\u00faa on August 14, 1765. The authors first describe the personnel and operations of the Yucat\u00e1n treasuries of Campeche, M\u00e9rida, and Bacalar, providing details on the number of employees and their titles and job descriptions, as well as the revenues, organization, and accounting methods of each branch. They discuss the economic impact of the encomiendas and the major products of the area, such as corn, cotton, and beeswax. There is also a section on the character of the Indian and the criollo, and their contribution to the economy. The authors argue repeatedly that an open trade policy between Spain and the colonies is the key to their development, and would also put an end to the problem of smuggling in the Yucat\u00e1n. Other topics covered include the economic justifications for engaging in the slave trade with Africa; the status of production of lumber, indigo, cochineal, and medicinal plants in the Yucat\u00e1n; and the importance of the shipbuilding and fishing industries. Finally, the authors discuss various the financial situation of churches, convents and religious orders in the province. Butler, R.L. Check list of the mss. in the Ayer Coll., 1210 Galarza, J.

Copy, dated Feb. 8, 1783, of a document of March 10, 1769 presented by Thomas Southwell to the Spanish government, describing rampant smuggling off the coasts of the Yucat\u00e1n and Honduras, and proposing to establish a fishing industry there to remedy the situation. Southwell condemns foreign ships, especially English ships, which, under the pretext of cutting logwood (palo de tinte) from the coasts of Yucat\u00e1n and Honduras, illegally take gold, silver, cochineal, deerskins, and fruits as well. The contraband is often openly traded farther up the coast in Veracruz, interfering with Spanish commerce and depriving the royal treasury of tax revenue. In addition, the English ravage the land and exploit the Indians. After describing the geography and resources of the Yucat\u00e1n, Honduras, and nearby Caribbean islands, Southwell proposes establishing a fishing industry to reduce English influence in the area, improve Spanish trade with the colonies, and attract settlers to the island of Roat\u00e1n. He lists necessary steps for implementing the plan, such as an open trade policy between Spain and her colonies; severe penalties for illegally harvesting and selling logwood; tax exemptions on salt used to dry fish; and the appointment of a special juez conservador to oversee the logwood and fishing industries.

Antonio Basilio Guti\u00e9rrez y Ulloa, Spanish gentleman and knight of the distinguished military order of Charles III, became intendente of the province of San Salvador in June, 1805. By most accounts, he was a competent and responsible functionary, especially during the first three years of his administration, when he made useful organizational reforms and produced his excellent Estado general de la provincia. In his later years in office, he was forced to contend with the growing local resentment of peninsular officials, and he was eventually replaced as intendente by a Creole in the insurrection of November 5, 1811.

Letter, dated November 1537 in Mexico City, to Charles V from Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga, bishop of Mexico; Juan L\u00f3pez de Z\u00e1rate, bishop of Oaxaca; and Francisco Marroqu\u00edn, bishop of Guatemala, in which they discuss the problems they face preaching Catholicism among the Indians of New Spain. The bishops first request instructions from the king on attendance at the General Council. They then ask the king to facilitate Christianization of the Indians by authorizing the construction of roads and pueblos; by building churches to replace the temples and caves in which the Indians continue practicing their idolatry; and establishing convents and church schools where Indians can be educated. They point out the benefits of teaching the Indians how to farm and to perform other jobs. They also request more missionaries to be sent to New Spain, especially those well\u2010trained in doctrine and theology. In view of the special problems the bishops face in New Spain, they ask for broader powers for themselves, such as filling benefice vacancies on a temporary basis. Other topics include requiring Indians to pay tithes or tribute to support the Church; imposing penalties on Indians for bigamy; allowing those Spaniards who have children by Indian women to remain in New Spain; standardizing baptismal rites and ceremonies; and using locally\u2010produced holy oils, instead of oil shipped a great distance from Mexico City.

The first c\u00e9dula announces that Philip II is now king of Spain, due to the failing health of the emperor, Carlos V. Other decrees deal with Indian matters, such as the disturbances in Chiapas by the Pochutla and Lacandon Indians, who have burned 14 pueblos, taken many captives, and sacrified children; the subjugation and resettlement of these Indian tribes; and the appointment of an oidor to collect taxes from the Indians in the provinces of Chiapas and Tabasco. The king also regulates tithes required of Indians, the days on which Indian cases are heard in court, and the proper celebration of Mass in Indian churches. Some c\u00e9dulas address dissension between the Franciscan and Dominican orders, and forbid members of religious orders to travel to America without permission from their prelates. Clergy assigned to one diocese cannot move to another without express approval of the bishop. Administrative c\u00e9dulas concern gold and silver shipments to Spain; the incorporation of the Soconusco region, formerly part of the Audiencia of New Spain, into the Audiencia of Guatemala; appointment and terms of office for regidores; proper procedure for filing petitions for mercedes; sale of public officers; copies of trials to be sent to Spain, including the residencia hearing of Diego Mart\u00ednez, former governor of Tierra Firme (i.e., Panama); and restrictions on the wearing of capes and swords by officials.

He enjoyed a distinguished academic career in history and international law, and between 1832 and 1841 he was official representative of Guatemala in various negotiations with Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. Commissioned by Mariano Galvez to write the history of Guatemala since independence, Marure produced his Bosquejo historico de las revoluciones de Centro America, published in 1837.

Pedro Alvarado gan\u00f3 en El Pinar de Quesaltenango [manuscript] : el dia 13 de mayo de 1524, vispera de Pascua del Espiritu Santo segun la Cronica de la Prova. de Sn. Franco. [17\u2010\u2010?] [12] leaves, bound ; 22 cm. Copies of two documents concerning the conquest of Quezaltenango, Guatemala by the Spaniards, under Pedro de Alvarado, in 1524. The first document, apparently based on the chronicle kept by the Franciscan convents,\n209\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory was signed by the governor and various government officials of Quezaltenango and Santa Cruz del Quich\u00e9 on October 20, 1567, and confirms Don Mart\u00edn Vel\u00e1squez\u2019s title to lands in Quezaltenango. Don Mart\u00edn, who is honored with the name Don Martin Velasquez ajpopo huichichil sunun, had been given ownership of nine parcialidades or districts by Quicab, the king of the Quich\u00e9, because he had defeated the Mam Indians in battle. After Don Pedro Alvarado\u2019s well\u2010armed soldiers defeated the warrior Tecum in the battle of El Pinar (Pine Grove) on May 13, 1524, the eve of the festival of the Holy Ghost, Don Mart\u00edn swore loyalty to the Spaniards, was baptized by the Franciscans, and became a loyal assistant to Alvarado and other officials in the Christianization of the area. As an important local chieftain, Don Mart\u00edn mobilized many of his Indians to work on the construction of the church, begun in 1532, the same year that the first feast of the Holy Ghost was celebrated to commemorate Alvarado\u2019s victory. The narrator indicates that the account has been faithfully translated from his native language to Castilian; and that the record of title has been made at the request of the great\u2010grandson of Don Mart\u00edn, Don Sebastian Belasquez Zunun, who has held many important civic and church positions in Quezaltenango. Also included, in a different hand, is a copy of a deposition dated May 15, 1524, from Pedro de Alvarado who, in the presence of the captains who fought with him, rewards Don Pedro Lopes Escot for his services. He also describes the baptism and education of the Indians by the Spaniards. In Spanish. Butler, R.L. Check list of the mss. in the Ayer Coll., 1030 At head of title: No. 5.

[24] leaves ; 31 cm.\n210\nGuatemala Unsigned legal memorandum, dated April 14, 1744, commenting on a judicial decree of December 5, 1741 concerning the administration of cofrad\u00edas and brotherhoods and the division and distribution of tithes to finance parishes and clergy; and suggesting steps to be taken locally to facilitate compliance with the law. The report presents legal justification of the division of the tithes used to finance different aspects of church operations, such as the maintenance of the prelate and chapter, the cathedral, and hospital, and salaries for priests. Various related c\u00e9dulas, laws and legal precedents are cited to justify collecting tithes from all parishioners, including Indians and ladinos. The new division and distribution of tithes will not result in a smaller portion for the subsistence of the priests; in fact, the new regulations will reduce abuses as well. Priests can require from the Indians only the legally prescribed tithes, and cannot extract additional payments of any kind for services such as presiding at funerals, reading marriage banns, or hearing confessions. The report discusses regulations for the establishment, administration, and financing of cofrad\u00edas, the lay groups in charge of maintaining shrines, religious images, pilgrimages, and ceremonies, and rules for reporting expenditures by charity hospitals. The guachivales, or brotherhoods in charge of patron saint celebrations, are administered in a similar fashion to the cofrad\u00edas. The concluding section makes clear that priests have no legal jurisdiction to punish those charged with criminal or civil offenses, but are limited to carrying out their spiritual responsibilities.

There are sample letters to government officials such as the president of the Audiencia, oidor or Audiencia judge, alcalde mayor, inspector, chief constable, and governor, in which the Indians of one village request that the lands stolen from them by Indians of a neighboring village be returned to them; or request that the local church be rebuilt after its destruction by an earthquake. Other letters seek official intervention in inheritance disputes, or report instances of witchcraft, thefts, and other crimes that have occurred in a certain village. Orders from military officers requisitioning cotton or other crops from the Indians, or demanding that they turn over a certain Indian wanted for questioning are given, as well as the responses of the villagers. Also included are sample letters to the bishop, presenting gifts of cacao; and to the parish priest, asking him to prevent the marriage planned by a man and a woman who are related. A letter to the priest from the choirmaster also advises him that the Indians of a village are reluctant to give up their children so that they can be instructed in Christian doctrine.

On November 20, 1821, eight of the leading men of Calkin\u00ed travel to the district capital of Man\u00ed to obtain certified copies of records in the main archives established by Francisco Montejo Xiu.

Sol\u00f3rzano, an oidor of the Audiencia of Lima, Peru, organizes the laws of the colonies under 18 titles, beginning with those laws governing the discovery of the Indies and establishing the colonies as the rightful possessions of the Spanish Crown. Title 4 laws govern the evangelistic efforts to convert the Indians to Catholicism, while Title 5 regulates the administration and operations of religious institutions such as churches, monasteries, hospitals, colleges, and seminaries. Other laws cover ecclesiastical immunity; powers and duties of bishops, archbishops, and prebendaries; tithes; royal patronage; courts of law; ecclesiastical judges; the Inquisition; and universities. Included in the ms. is a printed copy of Sol\u00f3rzano\u2019s Memorial of April 8, 1618, in which he proposes undertaking the Recopilaci\u00f3n to Philip III; as well as a handwritten, note of May 8, 1622 in which he presents the first volume of the Recopilaci\u00f3n to Philip IV, and promises to complete the remaining five.

The letter of June 27, 1501 sent to Florence by Bartolomeo Marchioni, a powerful Florentine banker in Lisbon, relates the return home of 4 caravels from the Cabral expedition and gives details on the spices and other exotic items they carry. Vespucci\u2019s letter of June 4, 1501 also describes the route navigated by Cabral, northeast from the Cape of Good Hope and along the coasts of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to Calicut, India. His 1502 letter from Lisbon to his patron, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de\u2019Medici in Florence, contains his account of the third voyage which he made for the king of Portugal. Following a route southwest from the coast of Africa, Vespucci reaches the South American continent, below the Tropic of Capricorn; and provides details on the lands and inhabitants he discovers.

[24] leaves, sewn ; 18 cm. Ms. account by Father Lucas Caballero, dated Jan. 24, 1708 in San Javier, Bolivia, formerly part of the Jesuit province of Paraguay, of his missionary journey from the San Javier settlement, near the San Miguel River, west across Bolivia to the Yurucares region, north of present\u2010day Cochabamba, between Aug. 4, 1707 and Jan. 24, 1708. Caballero promises to include in this report details of the lands and villages of the Manacicas, and to describe as well the surrounding territory inhabited by the Sibacas, Parabacas, Quisiacas, Yurucares, Picocas, Paunacas, and others. Caballero leaves San Javier on Aug. 4, 1707, with a group of Christianized Indians, many of whom soon turn back out of fear. By Aug. 15, Caballero reaches the home of the Sibacas, and their cacique Potumani, where a miracle of the Virgen takes place, in which a young man is healed. There are also some converts by the missionaries among the Yurucares, as well as among the enemies of the Yurucares, the Quibiquicas. Here, Caballero is confronted by many sick and dying Indians who believe that the missionaries have brought illness and plague to the tribe. Caballero describes his attempts to convert the Cosocas and the Subaricas, and includes his observations on the flora and fauna of the area, such as the glowing worms which carpet the ground, leaving behind their shells as man does on the day of the resurrection. Caballero asks the Tapacuras to lead him to the Bohococas, who live on the farthest boundary of the mission, a journey of three weeks. The account, copied in a neat and regular secretarial hand, probably by a scribe, for submission to a Jesuit official, includes a note appended in a different hand, documenting Caballero\u2019s murder by hostile Chiquitos on Sept. 27, 1711.

Cronica y relacion copiosa y verdadera [manuscript] / por Grmo. de Bibar natural de la ciudad de Burgos. 1558. 108 leaves, bound ; 31 cm. An account of the exploits of Pedro de Valdivia and his band of Spanish conquistadores, from 1538, when Valdivia received a commission from Francisco Pizarro of Peru to undertake the discovery, conquest, and settlement of Chile, to 1558, when Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, named governor of the provinces following the death of Validivia in 1554, continued the colonization of the provinces and battled the Indians. Vivar recounts the arrival of Valdivia in America; his role in the ongoing power struggle between Pizarro and Almagro in Peru; his trip to Chile as governor, where he established many cities, continually faced hostile Indians, and oversaw explorations and discoveries of the most distant regions of the kingdom; and finally his death at the hands of his enemies, the Araucanos. The account includes a detailed description of the clothing, religion, language, food, and appearance of the Indians of Chile, as well as information on the flora and fauna of the area. Vivar points out Chile\u2019s rich natural resources such as silver, gold, copper, salt, and an abundant Indian work force. There is also a chapter devoted to the ports of Chile, emphasizing their importance as points of support in the ongoing process of discovery and conquest. Finally, Vivar discusses the conquistadores themselves, their aspirations, tactics and strategies, and way of life. Vivar was born in Burgos, Spain, in 1524 or 1525, and travelled in 1548, perhaps as a sailor, to Chile, where he met Valdivia who had returned from Peru. It is believed that Vivar lived most of his life in Concepci\u00f3n, with a brief sojourn in Santiago in 1558. Vivar may have been a pseudonym for Juan de Carde\u00f1a y Criada, secretary to Valdivia; see Ger\u00f3nimo de Vivar: Cr\u00f3nica y relaci\u00f3n copiosa y verdadera de los reinos de Chile 1558 / ed. de Leopoldo Saez\u2010Godoy.

A copy of the official status report on the viceroyalty of New Granada, dated December 3, 1796 by the outgoing viceroy, Jos\u00e9 de Ezpeleta, for his successor, Pedro Mendinueta. Ezpeleta summarizes the state of the viceroyalty as he found it upon taking office on July 31, 1789, noting that priorities at that time\u2010\u2010 colonizing Darien and the Mosquito Coast, subjugating the Indians, finding a passage across the isthmus of Panama to link the two oceans, developing mining and agriculture, and maintaining a strong coastal defense\u2010\u2010resulted in a debt of 2 million pesos. He goes on to describe the present state of the viceroyalty, his achievements while in office, and issues that have yet to be resolved. His report deals systematically with 4 areas of government: ecclesiastical matters and the administration of the archbishoprics and missions; the functioning of the legal system, public education, and mines and commerce; fiscal issues such as tax revenues and public debt; and the fortification and defense of the viceroyalty.

[2] leaves ; 30 cm. Copy, from August 17, 1799, of an official dispatch of July 30, 1799, concerning delegation of powers when the viceroy is absent or unable to perform his duties. The dispatch from Juan Manuel Alv\u00e1rez of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the War Office is forwarded to an unidentified official (perhaps by the king\u2019s secretary) in an unsigned letter from the royal summer palace in San Ildefonso on August 17, 1799. Questions regarding the delegation of duties arose when Josef de Ezpeleta, viceroy of Nueva Granada, leaves Bogot\u00e1 to travel to Cartagena to receive his successor, Pedro de Mendinueta, and put the senior judge, \u02baoidor decano,\u02ba in charge of all viceregal affairs, with the exception of patronage, treasury, and military matters. This action gave rise to a dispute between the regent and the senior judge concerning delegation of military duties as well. The regent rejected the viceroy\u2019s ruling, and the question was referred to the king, Charles IV. The king upholds the ruling, as it is in keeping with existing royal ordinances, and asks that it be promulgated to all the Audiencias. In Spanish.

Copy, dated Jan. 2, 1629 in Anserma, Colombia, of reports concerning the expedition led by Capt. Mart\u00edn Bueno y Sancho to reconnoiter the lands of the Choco Indians in the Cordillera Occidental of the Andes, near Tatam\u00e1 and the surrounding areas. In response to the order issued by Juan Berm\u00fadez de Castro, governor of the province of Popay\u00e1n, Crist\u00f3bal Sanchez, intendent and justicia mayor of Anserma, authorizes depositions from various members of the expedition, dated Dec. 30, 1628: Diego Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n;\n246\nColombia Mart\u00edn del Pozo; Diego B\u00e9lez; Fulgencio G\u00f3mez; Francisco de Mena de la Fuente; Francisco Romero; Jacinto de Arboleda; and Marcos de Ayala. The group, consisting of 12 soldiers and 22 Indians porters, leaves Anserma in August 1628, and after 4 days travel, reaches the Choco settlements of Tatama and Morropa, where they spend 3 days. When Capt. Bueno prepares to continue onward, 5 Choco caciques offer him some 200 warriors and youths to take along, an offer which Bueno readily accepts. They journey 9 days\u2010\u2010a distance of 50\u201060 leagues\u2010\u2010to reach the land inhabited by hostile Citar\u00e1s, many of whom are killed or captured by the Spaniards. The witnesses describe the Citar\u00e1 dwellings, called \u02babarbacoas,\u02ba each of which houses 15\u201020 Indians and their families. At this point, the friendly Chocos refuse to go any further, as they are greatly outnumbered by hostile Indians. As the expedition heads homeward, 6 Chocos are wounded in a clash with the Citar\u00e1s. When the wounded Chocos are returned to their village, Capt. Bueno rewards them by giving them the booty captured from the enemy. He and his men reach Anserma in mid\u2010October, after a journey of 6 weeks. All witnesses agree that the region is very fertile, with abundant crops and rich gold deposits, which would yield great profits for the king. In addition, for the glory of the Catholic faith, the Indians should be pacified and Christianized. Depositions are recorded by notary public of Anserma, Francisco de Cartagena.

Eyewitness account by an anonymous Jesuit missionary priest of the difficulties encountered by the Jesuits in their efforts to establish missions in the Orinoco River Valley, just below the river delta and the city of Guyana, between 1731 and 1744. In 1731, eighty years after early Jesuit missions had been taken over by hostile Caribs, Padre Francisco Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, the Jesuit provincial of Nueva Granada, decided to renew efforts to christianize the Indians of the Orinoco River Valley around Guayana. Having received assurances from the governor of Guayana, Carlos Sucre, that armed soldiers would protect the missionaries, Gonz\u00e1lez names Fathers Joseph Gumilla and Bernardo Rotella to establish missions and begin evangelization of the heathens. Later, they are joined by other priests, Fathers Manuel Roman, Roque Lubian, and Francisco Olmo. The author describes the mission settlements they establish with the Otomaco, S\u00e1liva, and Cabre Indians, as well as some of the work done in the area by Franciscans and Capuchins. He recounts the great dangers the Jesuits face every day from the hostile Caribs, and the war waged by Governor Sucre\u2019s forces against these enemies. Epidemics of measles and chicken pox also decimate the native populations. In Spanish. Butler, R.L. Check list of the mss. in the Ayer Coll., 1180 Caption title.

An account of the exploits of Pedro de Valdivia and his band of Spanish conquistadores, from 1538, when Valdivia received a commission from Francisco Pizarro of Peru to undertake the discovery, conquest, and settlement of Chile, to 1558, when Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, named governor of the provinces following the death of Validivia in 1554, continued the colonization of the provinces and battled the Indians. Vivar recounts the arrival of Valdivia\n253\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory in America; his role in the ongoing power struggle between Pizarro and Almagro in Peru; his trip to Chile as governor, where he established many cities, continually faced hostile Indians, and oversaw explorations and discoveries of the most distant regions of the kingdom; and finally his death at the hands of his enemies, the Araucanos. The account includes a detailed description of the clothing, religion, language, food, and appearance of the Indians of Chile, as well as information on the flora and fauna of the area. Vivar points out Chile\u2019s rich natural resources such as silver, gold, copper, salt, and an abundant Indian work force. There is also a chapter devoted to the ports of Chile, emphasizing their importance as points of support in the ongoing process of discovery and conquest. Finally, Vivar discusses the conquistadores themselves, their aspirations, tactics and strategies, and way of life. Vivar was born in Burgos, Spain, in 1524 or 1525, and travelled in 1548, perhaps as a sailor, to Chile, where he met Valdivia who had returned from Peru. It is believed that Vivar lived most of his life in Concepci\u00f3n, with a brief sojourn in Santiago in 1558. Vivar may have been a pseudonym for Juan de Carde\u00f1a y Criada, secretary to Valdivia; see Ger\u00f3nimo de Vivar: Cr\u00f3nica y relaci\u00f3n copiosa y verdadera de los reinos de Chile 1558 / ed. de Leopoldo Saez\u2010Godoy.

The opinion, which begins, \u02baQue nuestro boto y parecer es este,\u02ba refers to the Viceroy\u2019s well\u2010documented visita general or tour of inspection of Peru between 1570 and 1575, one of many subjects of bitter contention between Toledo and the Audiencia. The judges support the Viceroy\u2019s request for subsidies from the treasury over and above his regular salary to help defray some of the special expenses incurred by him during his tour. However, the Viceroy must request the money from the king, since such a request falls outside of the judges\u2019 jurisdiction. Peru Lima 1570\u20101579 Manuscripts. In Spanish.

One of the powers of attorney, executed by Fray Alonso de Talavera on behalf of the priests of the monastery of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, allows Fray Diego del Cosar to represent the monastery in all present and future lawsuits in the viceroyalty of Nueva Granada.\n255\nColonial Spanish Sources for Indian Ethnohistory Peru Huancavelica 1578\u20101596 Manuscripts.

Anonymous 1777 ms. copy in Spanish of Urbano Tosetti\u2019s Riflessioni di un portoghese, first published in Lisbon in 1758, concerning the condemnation of the Jesuits in Portugal. In a letter of November 28, 1758 to a friend in Rome, Tosetti comments on a memorial of July 31, 1758, written by Lorenzo Ricci, the head of the Jesuit order, to Pope Clement XIII. After presenting the text of Ricci\u2019s memorial in which Ricci defends the order and asks the Pope for indemnity for those Jesuits not guilty of wrongdoing or abuses, Tosetti proceeds to attack the memorial on 21 points. Tosetti denounces the Jesuits, declaring that their abuses are widely\u2010recognized and the charges against them are based on concrete evidence. Even Cardinal Saldanha, a special representative appointed by Pope Benedict XIV to investigate abuses of the Society, condemned the Jesuits and favored sanctions against them. Tosetti includes a letter of November 3, 1748 from the Bishop of Nanking, China, as more evidence of the complaints against the Jesuits. He accuses the Jesuits of arrogance and greed, and declares them incapable of admitting their faults and weaknesses. He is especially critical of the commercial and banking enterprises operated by the Jesuits, and cites as proof various bills of exchange signed by members of the Company. Tosetti also rejects arguments made by other Jesuit\n260\nPer\u00fa leaders, Generals Franz Retz and Michelangelo Tamburini, whose documents are included in the ms. Peru Cuzco 1777 Manuscripts.

[200] leaves, bound ; 32 cm. Several documents concern the role of Juan Manuel Moscoso y Peralta, the bishop of Cuzco, in the Indian rebellion led by Tupac Amaru in 1780. In the draft of his petition to Charles III, dated April 19, 1785 in Lima, Moscoso tries to clear himself of charges of treason for his support of Tupac Amaru\u2019s uprising. He asks that the king\u2019s council examine the documents which will prove his innocence, and that the case be heard in open court. A copy of a letter of Feb. 19, 1785 from Moscoso to Teodoro de Croix, viceroy of Peru, with Croix\u2019s reply of Feb. 23, concerns those documents to be forwarded to the king on the bishop\u2019s behalf. There is also an anonymous letter from a citizen of Cuzco to his friend in Potos\u00ed, dated Nov. 14, 1783, in which the author refutes charges made against Moscoso for his conduct in the Tupac Amaru affair. A letter of Aug. 27, 1781 from Moscoso to Agust\u00edn de J\u00e1uregui, viceroy of Peru, describes the state of his diocese following the rebellion. Moscoso pleads for clemency for the Indians, and hopes to insure tranquility by strengthening church relations with the influential Indian caciques. Other documents include a copy of a c\u00e9dula real dated Feb. 13, 1791 in Madrid, from Charles IV, responding to a request from the Audiencia of Cuzco to publish Ignacio de Castro\u2019s Relaci\u00f3n de la fundaci\u00f3n de la Real Audiencia del Cuzco en 1788.

Photographic reproduction of the Primer nueva coronica i buen gobierno, written to King Philip III by the Inca chronicler Guam\u00e1n Poma de Ayala between 1583 and 1615. Guam\u00e1n Poma\u2019s illustrated chronicle is divided into two books: the Nueva cor\u00f3nica and the Buen gobierno. The first book, comprising fourteen chapters, includes the author\u2019s letters to the king and to the pope; his prologue to the readers; a Biblical account of the creation of the world; and descriptions of the Inca rulers and wives, the Inca system of laws and punishments, the native calendar, religious ceremonies, festivals, celebrations, and music, and the royal palaces, Inca nobles, and payments of tribute. The second book contains 32 chapters, describing the conquest of Peru by Pizarro and Almagro; the death of Atalhuapa; the resistance of the Incas to colonization by the Spaniards; the viceroys of Peru; and colonial society and government. There is also a description of colonial towns and cities. Guam\u00e1n Poma protests the destruction of traditional Inca society by the colonizers, and denounces the many abuses and injustices suffered by the Indians at the hands of the Spanish authorities and missionaries as they exploited the great mineral wealth of the country and attempted to Christianize the Incas. In an imaginary interview with the king, Guam\u00e1n Poma questions the monarch about how the Indians are being treated, and presents his own conclusions and opinions on the subject.

The last 2 chapters of the second part and all of the third part of the Miscel\u00e1nea, which Cabello Valboa began in 1576 and finished in Trujillo, Peru on July 9, 1586. He spent 10 years compiling notes on the history, origin, customs, and religion of the Indians of Peru; and included many chapters on the history of the Incas and their emperors such as Manco Capac and Huayna Capac. He describes Columbus\u2019 arrival in the New World, as well as the conquests of Pizarro, Almagro, and de Soto. There are also miscellaneous chapters dealing with topics such as famous sea voyages of exploration, volcanoes, freaks of nature, the origins of the gypsies, and the Christian religion. Peru Trujillo 1586 Manuscripts. Spanish priest, explorer, and chronicler. Born in M\u00e1laga, sometime between 1530 and 1535, Cabello Valboa came to America in 1566 and first settled in Bogot\u00e1. He later moved to Quito, where he became a lay priest in 1571. That same year, he accompanied Diego de Baz\u00e1n on his expedition to the jungles of Choc\u00f3, and continued his travels and explorations to isolated and unsettled provinces of Peru over the next ten years.

He writes as a Catholic priest who see the Incas as dirty, lazy, arrogant, idolatrous heathens who, with great effort and sacrifice, must be taught Christianity and salvation.

Eyewitness account by an anonymous Jesuit missionary priest of the difficulties encountered by the Jesuits in their efforts to establish missions in the Orinoco River Valley, just below the river delta and the city of Guyana, between 1731 and 1744. In 1731, eighty years after early Jesuit missions had been taken over by hostile Caribs, Padre Francisco Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, the Jesuit provincial of Nueva Granada, decided to renew efforts to christianize the Indians of the Orinoco River Valley around Guayana. Having received assurances from the governor of Guayana, Carlos Sucre, that armed soldiers would protect the missionaries, Gonz\u00e1lez names Fathers Joseph Gumilla and Bernardo Rotella to establish missions and begin evangelization of the heathens. Later, they are joined by other priests, Fathers Manuel Roman, Roque Lubian, and Francisco Olmo. The author describes the mission settlements they establish with the Otomaco, S\u00e1liva, and Cabre Indians, as well as some of the work done in the area by Franciscans and Capuchins. He recounts the great dangers the Jesuits face every day from the hostile Caribs, and the war waged by Governor Sucre\u2019s forces against these enemies. Epidemics of measles and chicken pox also decimate the native populations. In Spanish. Butler, R.L. Check list of the mss. in the Ayer Coll., 1180 Caption title.

A compilation of various records, reports, and proceedings, some copies, some originals, which together document the incorporation of Santo Tom\u00e1s de Tucupido, originally a Capuchin mission-pueblo, into a secular parish in 1798. The account begins with a copy of a royal c\u00e9dula of August 10, 1787, concerning the naming of magistrates as local authorities for the missions, followed by an order of October 21, 1790 from the Fiscal to undertake a thorough inventory of church possessions and a census of all residents. Included is the descriptive inventory of the churches, their chapels, convent, and all furnishings contained therein, produced in 1791 by Pedro V\u00edctores de la Cueba, local magistrate and surveyor, and Father F\u00e9lix Granada, president of the mission. There are also lists of the Indians and Spaniards of the mission, indicating name, age, marital status, number of children, and number confirmed. Some documents describe the lands turned over to the Indians, how the land will be divided up among the families, how the town will be governed, and the contributions from the royal treasury to the town for church maintenance. Other records from 1797 and 1798, signed by church officials, such as the bishop of the diocese, Juan Antonio de la Virgen Mar\u00eda y Viana, deal with doctrinal questions and confirm and accept the conversion of the mission into a secular parish.
