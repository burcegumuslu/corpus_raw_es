Introduction  \n1.1.  Description of the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) or \ncombinations thereof  \n\u2022 Herbal su bstance(s) \nThis assessment report reviews the scientific data available for the dried juice of the leaves of Aloe \nvera (L.) Burm. f., known also as Aloe barbadensis  Mill., (barbados aloes), or of Aloe ferox  Mill. and its \nhybrids (cape aloes) .  \nThe word \u201cAl oe\u201d in pharmacopoeias and formularies refers to the  herbal substance derived from the \ndried leaf juice. This has always created confusion due to the fact that the leaves are the source of two \nproducts \u201caloe dried juice\u201d and \u201caloe gel\u201d, which are quite diff erent in their chemical composition and \ntheir therapeutic properties.  \nThis assessment report does not cover aloe gel, for which a medicinal use is not considered evident  \n(Reynolds and Dweck , 1999; Radha  and Laxmipriya , 2014) . \nHerbal preparations are used worldwide and it is belonging to the most popular medicinal plants of the \nworld. Accordingly, aloe ha s been included into collections of monographs. The most important \namongst them are : \nEuropean Pharmacopeia \u2013  Aloes, Barbados  \nBarbados aloes consists of the concentrated and dri ed juice of the leaves of Aloe barbadensis  Mill. It \ncontains not less than 28% of hydroxyanthracene derivatives (HAD) expressed as barbaloin \n(C21H22O9; Mr 418.4) and calculated with reference to the dried herbal substance. The material \ncomplies with the Eu ropean Pharmacopoeia monograph \u201cAloes, Barbados \u201d (0257).  \nEuropean Pharmacopeia \u2013  Aloes, Cape  \nCape aloes consists of the concentrated and dried juice of the leaves of various species of Aloe, mainly Aloe ferox  Mill. and its hybrids. It contains not less tha n 18% hydroxyanthracene derivatives, \nexpressed as barbaloin (C\n21H22O9; Mr 418.4) and calculated with reference to the dried herbal \nsubstance. The mater ial complies with the European Pharmacopoeia monograph \u201cAloes, Cape\u201d (0258).  \nEuropean Pharmacopeia \u2013  Aloes dry extract, standardised  \nAloes dry extract, standardised, i s prepared from Barbados aloes (0257) or Cape aloes (0258) , or a \nmixture of both. The content of hydroxyanthracene derivatives is 19.0 %  to 21.0 % , expressed as \nbarbaloin (C 21H22O9; Mr 418.4), a djusted if necessary (dried extract). The extract is produced from the \nherbal drug by a suitable procedure using boiling water.  \nFurther monographs established on Aloe preparations:  \nUnited States Pharmacopeia: Aloe, USP 38, NF 33, Vol 2, p 2096  \nJapanese Pharmacopeia XV: Pow dered Aloe, p 1255  \nWHO Monographs on Selected Medicinal Plants, 1999  \n- Aloe, Vol 1   \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe ferox  Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus \nsiccatus  \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   \n Page 5/56 \n - Aloe Vera  Gel Vol 1  \nGerman commission  E, BAnZ 133 since 21.7.1993  \nESCOP Monographs, 2.

The juice is allowed to dry with or \nwithout the aid of heat.  \nAloe gel is a colourless mucilaginous gel obtained from the parenchymatous cells of the leaves. The \nmucilaginous parenchymous tissue is excised from fresh leaves. Therefore the leaves are \u201cfilleted\u201d, \nthat means that the external gree n parts of the leaves are peeled. Depending on whether the \nanthranoid -containing cells beneath are also removed, the gel is free of anthranoids or not. The fillets \nare immediately utilised for preparations or lyophilised and kept dry until use.  \nThis assessment refers to the dried juice (Aloes folii succus siccatus) but does not cover Aloe gel.  \n \n\u2022 Combinations of herbal substance(s) and/or herbal preparation(s) including a description of \nvitamin(s) and/or mineral(s) as ingredients of traditional combination h erbal medicinal products \nassessed, where applicable.  \nNot applicable  \n1.2.

Information  on documented medicinal use and historical data from \nliterature  \nIn the available data on traditional use, it is not always possible to differentiate the various aloe \npreparations that are mentioned because of insufficient description/declaration of active  ingredients. It \nis therefore not possible to attribute special traditional indications to defined aloe preparations, \nalthough it seems to be likely that aloe gel or similar preparations and not aloe dried juice were externally used.  \nBecause of this lack o f information, this section  covers all traditional indications reported for \u201caloe\u201d \naltogether.  \nAloe has a long history as a medicine and skin care aid. For over 6,000 years aloe was used for a wide range of ailments. The ancient Egyptians used aloe to heal  battle wounds and cure infections. The early \nGreeks used it for relieving blisters, burns and leg ulcers as well as bowel and stomach disorders. Legend i s that Aristotle persuaded Alexander the Great to conquer the Isle of Socroto to secure enough \nAloe ve ra to heal his soldiers\u2019 wounds. In England aloe was already used in the 10th century. In the \n12th century aloe was brought to Germany by Albertus Magnus ( Madaus,  1938).   \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe ferox  Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus \nsiccatus  \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   \n Page 8/56 \n Dioskurides ( translation : Berendes , 1902) already mentioned aloe in his materia medic a 50-70 A.D .: \nAloe is a purgative for  the stomach and abdomen and in jaundice. It represses haemoptysis. Aloe \nadministered externally heals wounds and ulcers as well as diseases of the eyes. It is good for \nheadache administered with vinegar and rose ointme nt on the forehead and temples. Together with \nvine it slows up hair loss. For inflammation of the mouth and tonsils, it is mixed with honey and vine.  \nThe British Pharmaceutical  Codex (1911)  mentions aloe as a purgative : because the action of aloe on \nthe la rge intestine induces some pelvic congestion, it is therefore employed as an emmenagogue in \namenorrhoea, generally with iron. The recommended dose is 1 to 3 decigrams (2 to 5 grains).  \nIn the Dispensatory of the United States of America  1918 aloe is mentio ned as a cathartic (purgative). \nIt is also described that it was formerly almost universally believed that aloe possessed emmenagogue \nproperties and it was accordingly largely used in the treatment of various forms of amenorrhea, but that it is extremely d oubtful whether aloe exercises any action upon the pelvic organs which is not \nattributable to its cathartic effects  (Remington & Wood, 1918) . \nIn his \u201cManual of Materia Medica and Pharmacology\u201d, Culbreth ( 1927)  mentions as indications \nconstipation, atonic d yspepsia, jaundice, non -active haemorrhoids, amenorrhea, ascarides; for the two \nlast may be given by enema.  \nHager (1925)  mentions the use as an appetising agent in low doses (0.05 \u2013  0.1 g) and as a cathartic in \nhigher doses (0.2 \u2013 1.0 g). The use in menstr uation, pregnancy and bleeding haemorrhoids is not \nrecommended because of congestion of the pelvis organs. The use as a clysma and as an eye ointment \nor powder is not very common  (Frerichs et al. 1925) . \nMadaus (1938)  gives a review of the use of aloe as di scribed  above. Paracelsus already indicated the \nuse as a purgative and as vesicant for an abscess. Lonicerus ( 1564)  described the purgative, \nemmenagogue and expectorant effects. Aloe was used for haemoptysis, jaundice, hydrops and as a vermifuge. Externall y aloe was used for headache, wounds, abscess and bleeding haemorrhoids.  \nMatthiolus (1626)  added the use against hair loss. Hecker ( 1814)  confirmed the indications mentioned \nabove. Additionally he described the use in gout and external use in inflammation s of the eyes. In \nEstonia aloe was sometimes used for tuberculosis.  \nKoenen (1977)  described the use of \u201cAloe hereroensis  Engler\u201d in South Africa. An aqueous extract was \nused for complains of digestion and for pectoral complains.  \nFurthermore the South Afric ans used aloe for syphilis and for inflammations of the eyes ( Watt et al., \n1962).  \nThe WHO monograph \u201cAloe\u201d mentions the following uses described in folk medicine, not supported by \nexperimental  or clinical data: treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis, peptic u lcers, tuberculosis, fungal \ninfections, and for reduction of blood sugar levels. The references given are not original sources and date from 1991 and 1995.  \nThe accepted historical use of \u201cAloe\u201d led to  the establishment of German Commission  E monograph \nand the European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP) monograph \u201cAloe capensis (Cape \nAloes)\u201d (ESCOP , 2003).  German pharmacovigilance actions have been published for anthranoid -\ncontaining laxatives of 21 June 1996, which were intended to set a framewo rk for safe use of hydroxyl \nanthracene derivatives containing herbal medicinal products  (BfArM, 1996) . \nTable 2: Overview of historical data   \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mai nly Aloe ferox  Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus \nsiccatus  \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   \n Page 9/56 \n Herbal preparation  Documented use / \nTraditional use Pharmaceutical \nform , \nStrength , Posology  \nDuration of use  Referenc e \nCuracao -Aloe, from \nconcentrated dried juice \nof the leaves of Aloe \nbarbadensis Miller, as well \nas their preparations in \nefficient posology . \nExtracts with water  \nAqueous -ethanolic dry \nextract  -, Concentrated  - \nand fluid extract as well \nas methanolic dry e xtracts  Obstipation  \n 20-30 mg HAD /day , \ncalculated as non-aqueous aloin  \nThe correct individual \ndose is the smallest \namount required to \nproduce a soft -formed \nstool.

Overall conclusions on medicinal use  \nFor over 6,000 years  aloe was used for a wide range of ailments.  \nBesides the most important use as a laxative, the use as an emmenagogue and the external use for \nwounds and abscess are described in most references mentioned above, however the preparations used are not well defined.  \nAs already mentioned in the Dispensatory  of the United States of America 1918, it is extremely \ndoubtful whether aloe exercises any action upon the pelvic organs which is not attributable to its cathartic effects (Remington &  Wood , 1918) . There are no plausible pharmacological data for this \nindication, nor for haemoptysis, jaundice or gout,  etc. \nConcerning the external use, the references do not describe exactly the preparations used.  \nHydroxyanthracene derivatives are a group of natural constituents  the pharmacologic action of which is \naccepted in literature. They are substantially contributing to the therapeutic activity as laxative \nmedicinal products. Accordingly, herbal medicinal products have to be standardized to the content of \nhydroxyanthracene  derivatives , for aloe preparations content is usually standardized to barbaloin. \nBased on existing marketing authorizations and with respect to an acceptable level of safety  (see later \nsections) the well -established use can be attributed.  \nFor other medic inal uses mentioned the requirements of well -established use are not fulfilled.

Non-Clinical Data \n3.1.  Overview of available pharmacological data regarding the herbal \nsubstance(s), herbal preparation(s) and rel evant constituents thereof  \n3.1.1.  Primary pharmacodynamics  \nData on the herbal substance  \nNine hours after oral administration to rats, aloe produced diarrhoea in 20% rats at doses of 5 g/kg bw \nand in 100% rats at doses of 20 g/kg bw. Lower doses of aloe (0.1 and 1.0  g/kg) did not pro duce a \ndiarrhoeal response. Pre -treatment  (i.p.) of rats with a NO synthase inhibitor (NG -nitro- L-arginine \nmethyl ester) reduced the diarrhoea induced by aloe (20 g/kg)) 9 h after its oral administration. The \nincrease in faecal water ex cretion was also reduced. L -arginine administered to rats pre- treated with \nthe NO synthase inhibitor, drastically reduced the effect of this inhibitor. Given alone, L -arginine did \nnot modify aloe -induced diarrhoea. Basal Ca2\u00b1 dependent  NO synthase activity  in the rat colon was \ndose-dependently inhibited by aloe (0.1 \u2013  20.0 g/kg bw) and by aloin (0.1 \u2013  1.0 g/kg bw), the active \ningredient of aloe. The authors concluded that these results suggest that endogenous NO modulates \nthe diarrhoeal effect of aloe (Izzo et al., 1999).  \nData on he rbal preparations  \nInvestigations of Izzo et al . suggest ed that nitric oxide (NO) is a possible mediator for the laxatives \neffect of anthranoid -containing products; in 1996 (Izzo et al. , 1996) and 1997 (Izzo et al. , 1997) they \ninvestigated the role of NO in senna - and cascara- induced diarrhoea in the rat, and in 1999 (Izzo et \nal., 1999) the role of NO in aloe -induced diarrhoea in the rat.  \nIn the study of Wintola et al. (2010) , the efficacy of an aqueous total leaf extract of Aloe fe rox Mill. the \ndried leaves were grinded into powder and 100 g of the material was extracted by shaking for 24 h in \n1000 ml of distilled water, filtered freeze dried and reconstituted in water ( ratio not defined) was \nstudied against loperamide -induced const ipation in Wistar rats. Constipation was induced by oral \nadministration of loperamide (3 mg/kg body weight) while the control rats received normal saline. The \nconstipated rats were treated with 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight/day of the extract for 7 day s \nduring which the feeding characteristics, body weight, f aecal properties and gastrointestinal transit \nratio were monitored. The extract improved intestinal motility, increased f aecal volume and normalized \nbody weight in the constipated rats.  \nThe study o f Ashafa et al.  (2011)  evaluated the effect of an ethanolic total leaf extract of Aloe vera  \nagainst loperamide -induced constipation in rats. The  leaves of A loe vera were thoroughly washed with  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe ferox  Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus \nsiccatus  \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   \n Page 12/56 \n distilled water, cut into thin slices, and air -dried at room te mperature to a constant weight. The dried \nleaves were grinded into a powder and 40 g of the material was extracted by shaking it for 24 h in 500 \nml of ethanol. The extract obtained was filtered through Whatman no. 1 (70 mm) filter paper and concentrated on  a water bath at 45\u00b0C to give a yield of 5.2 g (hydroxyanthracene content (HAD) \nunknown). This was reconstituted in distilled water to give the required doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight for the experiment (relation not known). Rats were constipa tion induced by the \noral administration of loperamide (3 mg/kg body weight) while the control animals received normal \nsaline. Constipated rats were treated with 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight/day of the ethanolic \nleaf extract for 7 days during which th e feeding characteristics, body weight, f aecal properties, and \ngastrointestinal transit ratio were monitored. Treatment of constipated rats with the extract at 50, 100, \nand 200 mg/kg body weight for 7 days improved intestinal motility, increased f aecal vol ume, and \nnormalized body weight in the constipated rats. These are indications of the laxative property of the \nherb with the 200 mg/kg body weight of the extract showing the best effect.  \nAssessor\u00b4s Comment :  \nData on  the hydroxyanthracene content  are not re ported. Extracts were obtained from total leaves. \nNevertheless , data demonstrate  a dose dependent pharmacodynamic effect in rats.  \nData on hydroxyanthracene derivatives  \nHydroxyanthracene derivatives are considered as prodrugs which are degraded to the thera peutically \nactive form during intestine passage. A broad set of literature data is describing details of the generally acknowledged mode of action, which is explaining the therapeutic usage as laxatives.  \nIshii et al. (1990)  investigated the mechanism of ac tion of aloe -emodin -9-anthrone in causing a \nsignificant increase in the water content of the rat large intestine. Aloe -emodin -9-anthrone inhibited \nrat colonic sodium/potassium -adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+ -ATPase) in vitro,  and increased the \npara- cellular permeability across the rat colonic mucosa in vivo . Therefore, it seemed that the increase \nin water content of the rat large intestine produced by aloe -emodin -9-anthrone was due to both \ninhibition of absorption and stimulation of secretion without stimu lation of peristalsis. Since, pre -\ntreatment with loperamide completely prevented the increase of para -cellular permeability induced by \naloe-emodin -9-anthrone, but did not completely reduce the concomitant increase in residual fluid \nvolume, other multiple m echanisms of action might be involved in the increase of water content in the \nrat large intestine.  \nHoenig et al. (1992)  and Rauwald et al . (1992)  studied the influence of 23 anthraquinones and \nanthrones on the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) which is effe cted in Ehrlichs ascites tumour  cells \nby activation of Cl\n--channels. They showed that the inhibition of the Cl--channels\u2019 activity was the \nstrongest by aloe -emodin -anthrone and aloe -emodin. These anthraquinones reduce the Cl - \npermeability of the cells, this influence being sometimes more pronounced than that of the Cl-  channel \nblocker 130B. In contrast to the investigations of Ishii Y . et al. (1990)  both substances showed no \npronounced inhibition activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. Rhein, frangula -emodin and oth er anthraquinones \nwith an additional phenolic hydroxyl group showed inhibition.  \nResults of investigations of Capasso et al.  (1983)  in rat isolated colon suggest that the laxative \nproperties of aloin and 1,8 -dioxyanthraquinone may depend, at least in part, on increased \nprostaglandin synthesis by the intestinal tissue.  \nTavares et al. (1996)  compared the effects of rhein and aloe- emodin with that of ricinoleic acid and \ncalcium ionophore A23187 on platelet- activating factor (PAF) release by human gastrointestin al \nmucosal pieces in vitro. Ricinoleic acid and calcium ionophore stimulated release of PAF from human  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe ferox  Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus \nsiccatus  \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   \n Page 13/56 \n stomach, ileum or colon mucosa. Aloe -emodin (100 \u00b5g/ml) stimulated a small release of PAF in ileum \nand colon mucosa. Rhein had no effect. 5 -aminosalicylic acid (100 \u00b5g/ml) inhibited PAF release induced \nby the drugs. The authors concluded that rhein exerted its laxative effects by a mechanism that did not \ninvolve PAF release, and that aloe -emodin may act partly via PAF release.  \nIzzo et al. (1998)  reviewed t he key features of the involvement of NO and PAF in the action of \nlaxatives. PAF is a phospholipid mediator of inflammation and stimulates anion secretion in animals \nand in isolated preparations of human colon. NO, synthesised from the amino acid L -arginin e, is an \nimportant enteric inhibitory neurotransmitter. In addition, NO -donating compounds stimulate anion \nsecretion in rat and guinea -pig colon .  \nOral administration of sennosides (20 -30 mg/kg) to fasted dogs has been shown to induce a strong \nand long -lasting inhibition of myoelectric colon activity which was evident after a delay of 6 -10 h \ncorresponding to oro- caecal transit and colonic metabolism and was accompanied by abundant \ndiarrh oea. When sennosides were given 1 h before a meal, the postprandial inc rease in colon motility \nfailed to appear. Recent studies with strain gage transducers confirm the inhibition of colonic motility \nafter oral sennosides but, in addition, 3 -10 'giant contractions' with a high amplitude appeared during \nthe period of inhibition. Most of these single contractions were propagated over the second half of the colon at a velocity of 0.5 -2 cm/min. Elimination of liquid f aeces was always associated with giant \ncontractions. These giant contractions have also been described with other s timuli (i.v. guanethidine or \nneostigmine, oral castor oil, intraluminal hypertonic glucose) and are therefore not specific for \nsennosides (Fioramonti et al. , 1988)  \nLongo (2002) referred in his monograph \u201cAloe today\u201d (part four) to recent investigations tha t produced \na better explanation of the mechanism of the action of stimulus on the colon. The inhibition of \nNa+/K+ -ATPase  and the release of NO are relevant to stimulate the secretion of electrolytes and the \nrelaxation of smooth intestinal muscles. Further more, investigations outlined that NO plays a new \nphysiopathological role regarding PAF, which causes the contraction of the smooth musculature.  \nThe authors summarized that  biological factors such as PAF and NO may play a role on the action of \nthe stimulus  on the colon, but it should be considered that the investigations were  only experimental \nones.  \nIshii et al. (1994)  measured simultaneously in the same rat charcoal transport, as an indicator of the \ndegree of peristalsis, and water content in the large int estine after intracaecal administration of \nbarbaloin. Charcoal transport was significantly accelerated at both 3.5 and 6.5 h ours after the \nadministration of barbaloin. At 6.5 h, diarrhoea instead of normal faeces was observed. Moreover, at 1 \nh before the a cceleration of charcoal transport, a marked increase in water content of the large \nintestine was observed: It appeared that the increase in water content of the large intestine induced by barbaloin preceded the stimulation of peristalsis, attended by diarr hoea. The authors therefore \nsuggested that the increase in water content is a more important factor than the stimulation of peristalsis in the diarrhoea induced by barbaloin.  \nAloe-emodin  anthrone and rhein anthrone, and their equimolar mixture, induced exc retion of an \napproximately equal number of faeces by intracaecal administration at a dose of 23.2 mumol kg -1 in \nmice (= 1.0 standard dose). The number of wet faeces induced by aloe -emodin  anthrone was less than \nthose of rhein anthrone and the mixture. At the same dose, rhein anthrone and the mixture significantly stimulated large intestinal propulsion, though aloe -emodin  anthrone had little stimulatory \neffect. Aloe-emodin  anthrone and rhein anthrone decreased net water absorption but could not reverse \nit to the net secretion at 1/2 dose. The mixture significantly decreased net water absorption and \nreversed it to the net secretion at this dose. These anthrones did not stimulate mucus secretion in the  \n \nAssessmen t report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe ferox  Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus \nsiccatus  \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   \n Page 14/56 \n colon at 1/2 dose. The authors concluded that the synergist ic purgative effect of aloe -emodin  anthrone \nand rhein anthrone in mice results from synergistic stimulation of large intestinal transit and large \nintestinal water secretion (Yagi et al. , 1997).  \nThe exact mechanism of action is still unknown. Besides a dire ct influence of the motility leading to a \nreduced transit time, an influence on secretion processes by two concomitant mechanisms is assumed \nEspecially inhibition of absorption of water and electrolytes (Na+,Cl-) into the colonic epithelial cells \n(antiabso rptive effect) and increase of the leakiness of the tight junctions and stimulation of secretion \nof water and electrolytes into the lumen  of the colon (secretagogue effect) may result in enhanced \nconcentrations of fluid and electrolytes in the lumen of the  colon. The fluid absorption is reduced. This \nmay lead to an increase of the intestine content and the intraluminal pressure, which indirectly \nstimulate the peristalsis . \n \nPreclinical pharmacokinetic data  on hydroxyanthracene derivatives  \nSome pharmacokinetic data are presented here to support the pharmacodynamic concept and \nmetabolism  for the laxative effect. For more details see section 3.2.  \nTo determine the intestinal uptake and metabolism of physiologically active aloe components using in \nvitro intestinal absorption model was the objective of the following study. The Caco- 2 cell monolayer \nand the everted gut sac were incubated with 5- 50 microM of aloin, aloe -emodin, and aloesin. The \nbasolateral appearance of test compounds and their glucuronosyl or sulfate d forms were quantified \nusing HPLC. The % absorption of aloin, aloe -emodin, and aloesin was ranged from 5.51% to 6.60%, \n6.60% to 11.32%, and 7.61% to 13.64%, respectively. Up to 18.15%, 18.18%, and 38.86% of \naloin, aloe-emodin, and aloesin, respectively, w as absorbed as glucuronidated or sulfated form. These \nresults suggest that a significant amount is transformed during absorption. The absorption rate of test \ncompounds except aloesin was similar in two models; more aloesin was absorbed in the everted gut \nsac than in the Caco -2 monolayer. These results provide information to establish adequate intake level \nof aloe to maintain effective plasma level (Park et al., 2009)  \nPharmakokinetic studies by Lang ( 1993)  after oral administration of 14 C-aloe-emodin to male and \nfemale rats showed that 20 -30% of the dose was excreted in the urine and the rest was excreted in \nthe faeces as rhein and conjugates. 10% of the radioactivity was identified as free aloe- emodin in the \nplasma with a maximum peak at 1.5 -3.0 h after the administration.  Only the liver, kidney and \ngastrointestinal tract showed higher concentrations than the plasma. The terminal half -life of the \nradioactivity in the blood was 50 h ours. \nIn contrast Ishii et al.  showed that aloe -emodin -9-anthrone was produced  in the rat large intestine \n(Ishii et al., 1994, Ishii  et al., 1999). Aloe- emodin -9-anthrone is the main active metabolite, which \nacts specifically on the colon ( Ishii et al., 1990).  \nAdministration of emodin  to rabbits by i.v. bolus resulted in a serum pr ofile which could be well \ndescribed by a two -compartment model. The AUC of emodin  was 518 micrograms min/ml, clearance \nwas 72.3 ml/min, and  elimination half -life was 227 min which was much longer than that reported in a \nprevious study. Oral administration of emodin  resulted in a very  low serum concentration. Protein \nbinding of emodin  was investigated by the equilibrium dialysis method. Emodin  was found to be highly \nbound (99.6%) to serum protein (Liang et al. , 1995)  \n  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe ferox  Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus \nsiccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015  Page 15/56 \n Table 4: Overview of the main non -clinical data/conclusions \nHerbal preparation tested  Posology  Experimental \nmodel  Reference  Main non -clinical \nconclusions  \nComparable/similar preparations to preparations of the monograph  \nAqueous leaf extract of Aloe \nferox Mill not standardized  50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight/day of the extract  Loperamide- induced \nconstipation in Wistar \nrats Wintola et al., 2010 The extract improved intestinal motility, increased f aecal \nvolume and normalized body \nweight in the constipated rats.  \nOther preparations  \nAloe 0.1 an d 1 g/kg;  \n5 g/kg; 20 g/kg oral \nadministration  Rat Izzo et al., 1999 Pre-treatment (i.p.) of rats with \na NO synthase inhibitor (NG -\nnitro- L-arginine methyl ester) \nreduced the diarrhoea induced \nby aloe (20 g/kg)  \nEthanolic leaf extract of Aloe \nvera 50, 100, a nd 200 mg/kg bw  Loperamide- induced \nconstipation in rats  Ashafa et al., 2011 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body \nweight for 7 days improved \nintestinal motility, increased \nfaecal volume, and normalized \nbody weight  \nHydroxyanthracene derivatives  \nAloe-emodin -9-anthro ne  In vitro  \nIn viv o \nRat Ishii et al.,1990 Aloe-emodin -9-anthrone \ninhibited rat colonic \nsodium/potassium -adenosine \ntriphosphatase (Na+/K+ -\nATPase) in vitro, and increased \nthe paracellular permeability across the rat colonic mucosa in vivo   \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe ferox  Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus \nsiccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015  Page 16/56 \n Herbal preparation tested  Posology  Experimental \nmodel  Reference  Main non -clinical \nconclusions  \nEmodin  i.v. and o ral  In vivo ; rabbit  Liang et al., 1995 Oral administration of emodin  \nresulted in a very low serum \nconcentration  \n23 anthraquinones and \nanthrones   In vitro  \nRegulatory volume \ndecrease RVD reduction in Ehrlich Aszites Cells by \nactivation of Cl-  \nchannels  Hoenig et al., 1992 The inhibition of the Cl-\nchannels\u2019 activity was the \nstrongest by aloe -emodin -\nanthrone and aloe -emodin  \nBarbaloin  Intracaecal  Rat charcoal \ntransport, as an \nindicator of the \ndegree of peristalsis, and water content in \nthe large intestine \nafter intracaecal \nadministration of barbaloin  Ishii, 1994 Charcoal transport was significantly accelerated at both \n3.5 and 6.5 h after the \nadministration of barbaloin  \n14 C-aloe-emodin   Male and female rats Lang et al., 1993 20-30% of the dose was \nexcreted in the urine and the \nrest was excreted in the f aeces \nas rhein and conjugates  \nSennosides Oral Fasted dogs  Fioramonti et al., 1988 Inhibition of colonic motility \nafter oral sennosides but, in  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe ferox  Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus \nsiccatus  \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015  Page 17/56 \n Herbal preparation tested  Posology  Experimental \nmodel  Reference  Main non -clinical \nconclusions  \naddition, 3 -10 'giant \ncontractions' with a high \namplitude appeared during the \nperiod of inhibition over the \nsecond half of the colon at a \nvelocity of 0.5 -2 cm/min.  \nAloe-emodin  anthrone and Rhein \nanthrone  Intracecal Mice Yagi et al., 1997 Rhein anthrone and the \nmixture significantly stimulated \nlarge intestinal propulsion, though aloe-emodin  anthrone \nhad little stimulatory effect.  \n  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 18/56 \n Assessor\u2019s Comment : \nIn vitro and in vivo studies in rats , mice and rabbits  demonstrated that aloe-emodin -9-anthrone \ndisturbed the equilibrium between the absorption of water from the intestinal lumen via inhibition of \nactive sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase and increased  the para -cellular permeability across \nthe colonic mucosa (Ishii et al. , 1990) . It stimulated  peristaltic activity in the large intestine , \nstimulated  mucus secretion (Ish ii et al. , 1994) and led to secret ion of  water into the lumen by a \nprostaglandin -dependent mechanism (Capasso et al. , 1983). The result was  a net reduction  in water \nabsorption and more frequent stools with softer consistency.  Studies with strain gage trans ducers \nconfirm ed the inhibition of colonic motility after oral sennosides but, in addition, 3 -10 'giant \ncontractions' with a high amplitude appeared during the period of inhibition (Fioramonti et al. , 1988).  \n3.1.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamics  \nThere are many experi mental investigations, which study several effects of different ingredients of \naloe. The part of the plant, from which the ingredients were isolated, has not always been defined \nexactly. Investigations of the gel or of substances isolated from the gel are not mentioned in the \nassessment report.  \nCytotoxic  effects of aloe -emodin  \nData on hydroxyanthracene derivatives \nGrimaudo et al. (1997)  studied the antitumour effects of 5 purified compounds from the plant Aloe \nvera on human K562 leukaemia cells and on the m ultidrug resistant (MDR) variant cell line, K562/R. \nThe glycosides aloin A and B, aloesin and aloeresin were devoid of antitumour activity up to 200 \u00b5M \nconcentrations. Only the aglycon aloe -emodin produced reproducible cytotoxic  effects. Aloe -emodin \ncaused  mainly cytostasis and accumulation of the cells in the S and G2 -M phases of the cell cycle \nduring the first 48 h of treatment. Thereafter, massive cell death ensued.  \nFenig  et al. (2004)  conducted a study to determinate if members of the anthraquinone family could be \nused as adjuncts to increase the growth inhibiting effect of anticancer agents in Merkel cell carcinoma \n(MCC). An adherent variant of MCC was derived from a previously established MCC cell line \nsuspension. Emodin and aloe -emodin inhibited proli feration of the adherent MCC cells, with a slight \nadvantage of aloe -emodin over emodin. Aloin had no effect on cell proliferation. The chemotherapeutic \nagents, cis- platinol (abiplastin), doxorubicin (adriablastin), and 5 -fluorouracil, and the tyrosine kina se \ninhibitor STI 571, all independently inhibited the proliferation of adherent MCC cells. The addition of aloe-emodin potentiated their inhibitory effect, especially when low concentrations of the anticancer \ncompounds were used.  \nChen et al. (2004)  evaluat ed the chemo preventive role of aloe -emodin in human promyelocytic \nleukaemia  HL-60 cells in vitro by studying the regulation of proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. The \nauthors concluded that aloe -emodin appears to exert its anti- carcinogenesis propert ies by inhibiting \nproliferation and  inducing cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis underwent activation of caspase -3 in human \nleukemia HL -60 cells.  \nLee et al. (2001, 2005)  demonstrated that aloe -emodin induced a significant change in the expression  \nof lung canc er cell  apoptosis -related proteins compared to those of control cells.  \nIn order to assess the role of oxidative stress in the cytotoxicity of natural hydroxyanthraquinones, the \nauthors  compared rhein, emodin, danthron, chrysophanol, and carminic acid, and a series of model \nquinones with available values of single -electron reduction midpoint potential at pH 7.0 (E(1)7), with \nrespect to their reactivity in the single -electron enzymatic reduction, and their mammalian cell toxicity.  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. a nd on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 19/56 \n The toxicity of model quinon es to the bovine leukemia virus -transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line \nFLK), and HL -60, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, increased with an increase in their E(1)7. \nA close parallelism was found between the reactivity of hydroxyanthraquinones an d model quinones \nwith single -electron transferring flavoenzymes ferredoxin: NADP+ reductase and NADPH:  cytochrome \nP450 reductase, and their cytotoxicity. This points to the importance of oxidative stress in the toxicity \nof hydroxyanthraquinones in these ce ll lines, which was further evidenced by the protective effects of \ndesferrioxamine and the antioxidant N,N' -diphenyl -p-phenylene diamine, by the potentiating effects of \n1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl) -1-nitrosourea, and an increase in lipid per oxidation (Nemeika ite-Ceniene et al., \n2002) . \nAnti-inflammatory effect  \nIn investigations using the contact hypersensitivity response Yagi et al.  (2003)  showed a preventive \neffect of aloesin, isolated from Aloe species, on the UV -B-induced immune suppression. Furthermore, \naloesin inhibited tyrosine hydroxylase and dihydroxyphenylalanine  (DOPA) oxidase activities of \ntyrosinase from normal human melanocyte cell lysates. Therefore the authors regard this substance as \na positive pigment -altering agent.  \nAntibacterial effect  \nData on hydroxyanthracene derivatives  \nThe phenolics and aloins of Aloe vera were found to have dose- dependent non -competitive inhibitory \neffects on Clostridium histolyticum  metalloproteinases and collagenases (Barrantes and Guinea, 2003).  \nData on herbal preparati ons \nLorenzetti et al. (1964)  showed a bacteriostatic effect of the \u201cjuice of the leaves\u201d on Staphylococcus \naureus , Streptococcus pyogenes , Corynebacterium xerose  and Salmonella paratyphi. Aloe -emodin and \nchrysophanol were ineffective.  \nAnother investigation  by Liu et al.  (1996)  showed potent antibacterial activity of aloe -emodin (source \nnot mentioned) against methicillin -resistant  Staphylococcus aureus.  \nAntifungal effect  \nData on herbal preparations  \nShamim  et al. (2004)  evaluated  the activity of Aloe barbaden sis Miller against some common fungal \nspecies associated with superficial mycoses. The ethanol and aqueous extracts it were tested to \nestablish the antimycological effects against dermatophytes, saprophytes, and Candida species isolated \nfrom infected hospi talised patients. The in vitro antifungal activity was established by observing and \nmeasuring the zones of inhibition formed on selective nutrient media. Zones of inhibition were \ncategorised as very high (41- 50 mm), high (31- 40 mm), medium (21- 30 mm), and low (11 -20 mm). \nHigh zones of inhibition were noted with the ethanol extract.  \nModulation of immune response  \nData on herbal preparations  \nIn a study the specific and non -specific immune response of BALB/c mice, healthy and \nimmunosuppressed with murine lympho ma L5178Y, treated with bitter yellow juice (extract) of Aloe \nvera (L) were investigated. It was observed that the immunosuppressed mice, treated with the whole \nextract of the bitter yellow juice achieved restoration of immunological parameters in cellular  immune \nresponse and phagocytosis. On the other hand, the humoral immunity was not restored. Also, in the  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 20/56 \n healthy rodents treated with the extract, it caused the stimulation of specific and non -specific \nresponses, the results had significant differences wi th the obtained ones in untreated mice (Oronzo-\nBarocio  et al., 1999).  \n3.1.3.  Safety pharmacology  \nData on herbal preparations  \nWintola  et al. evaluated in 2011 the toxicological effect of aqueous leaf extract of the herb at 50, 100 \nand 200 mg/kg body weight for 7 days on the haematological parameters as well as liver and kidney \nfunction indices in loperamide -induced constipated rats. The extract did not cause any significant (p > \n0.05) effect on the kidney and liver -body weight ratio as well as the kidney function indices including \nserum levels of creatinine , uric acid, urea, calcium and potassium ions at all the dosages investigated. \nWhereas the serum levels of total protein, albumin, bilirubin and gamma glutamyl tra nsferase (GGT) \nwere not affected, the elevated act ivities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT) \nand aspartate transaminase (AST) in the untreated constipated animals were normalized following treatment with extract. The data obtained with respect to the haematological analysis indicate d that \nthe extracts had no significant (p > 0.05) effect on the haematological parameters with the exception \nof lymphocyte count which was increased in the untreated constipated rats. This was attenuated after \nadministering the herb.  \nAloe has also been re ported to have an effect on liver function. The cytoprotective effect of aloe extract \nagainst 1,4 -naphthoquinone -induced hepatotoxicity was evaluated in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. \nAfter exposure to 1,4- naphthoquinone (100 microM), a decrease in cell  viability measured as >60% \nlactate dehydrogenase depletion was induced. Cellular glutathione (GSH) and protein -SH levels were \nalso significantly decreased in a time -dependent manner. 1 g Aloe powder (a mixture A. ferox Miller, A. \nafricana Miller, A. spicata  Baker) mixed with 20 parts of 50% ethanol for 24 h; centrifugation 11,400xg \nfor 10 min; ethanol evaporated; residue freeze dried; then 10 parts of water were added; mixing for 3 \nh; centrifugation 11,400xg for 10 min; supernatant freeze dried to yield th e 50% ethanol fraction; the \n50% ethanol fraction suspended in water, extracted with chloroform; the residual water fraction extracted with ethyl acetate, followed by butanol). However addition of aloe extract resulted in a dose -\ndependent improvement of thes e effects. This cytoprotective effect of aloe could be attributed to its \ninhibition of GSH and protein -SH depletions. The effect s of aloe extracts were also dose -dependent. \nAddition of diethyl maleate (1 mM ), a cellular glutathione -depleting agent, to hepa tocytes treated with \nboth 1,4- naphthoquinone and aloe extract, induced depletion of GSH, but did not affect protein -SH or \nlactate dehydrogenase. These results suggest that the 1,4- naphthoquinone -induced toxicity in rat \nhepatocytes was inhibited by aloe extract, and that this protective effect was due to the maintenance \nof cellular thiols, especially protein -SH (Norikura et al. , 2002).  \n3.1.4.  Pharmacodynamic interactions  \nChronic use or abuse of aloe dried juice preparations may lead to hypokalaemia. This hypokalaem ia \nand the increased loss of potassium may increase the activity of cardiac glycosides and interfere with \nthe action of antiarrhythmic  agents (interaction with antiarrhythmic medicinal products, which induce \nreversion to sinus rhythm, e.g. quinidine) and m edicinal products inducing QT -prolongation \n(Haverkamp , 2002). Concomitant use with medicinal products inducing hypokalaemia (e.g. diuretics, \nadrenocorticosteroids and liquorice root) may aggravate electrolyte imbalance.  \nChung et al. (1996)  investigated the influence of aloe on the ethanol metabolism in rats based on \nreports indicating that an extract of aloe enhances ethanol metabolism. Aloe contains aloin, a C -\nglycoside of anthraquinone. Quinones in general have a functional role in elevating the ethanol  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 21/56 \n metabolism rate in vivo . Upon oral administration of aloin (300 mg/kg) 12 h before ethanol \nadministration, the area under the curve of blood ethanol significantly decreased by 40%, while the \nslope of elimination and rate of disappearance from the body incre ased by 60% and 64%, respectively.  \n3.2.  Overview of available pharmak okinetic data regarding the herbal \nsubstance(s), herbal preparation(s) and relevant constituents thereof  \nData on hydroxyanthracene derivatives  \nAloins A and B, hydroxyaloins and the aloinoside s A and B are not absorbed in the upper gut. In \nhumans, they pass into the colon unmodified after oral ingestion. Human intestinal flora are able to \nbreak down O -glycosides easily but only to some extent C -glycosides of most anthranoids. A strictly \nanaerob ic bacterium , Eubacterium  sp. BAR, was isolated from human faeces as one of the intestinal \nbacteria capable of metabolising barbaloin to alo e-emodin anthrone (Hattori et al., 1988; Che et al ., \n1991). Barbaloin was transformed to aloe -emodin anthrone in the  faeces from gnotobiotic rats mono-\nassociated with the Eubacterium  sp. BAR, but not in faeces from conventional rats or the gnotobiotic \nrats mono -associated with Peptostreptococcus intermedius , a human intestinal anaerobic bacterium  \ncapable of reducing sen nidins to rhein anthrone. Only in gnotobiotic rats mono- associated with the \nEubacterium  sp. BAR administration of barbaloin causes severe diarrhea. The faecal water content was \nsignificantly increased (Akao et al. , 1996). In contrast Ishii et al.  showed th at aloe -emodin -9-anthrone \nwas produced in the rat large intestine (Ishii et al. , 1994; Ishii et al. , 1998). Aloe- emodin -9-anthrone \nis the main active metabolite, which acts specifically on the colon (Ishii et al. , 1990).  \nIt is not known to what extent alo e-emodin -9-anthrone is absorbed. In the case of senna, animal \nexperiments with radio -labeled rhein anthrone administered directly into the caecum demonstrated \nabsorption < 10% (De Witte and Lemli , 1988).  \nAfter oral administration of 4.5 mg/kg 14C -aloe-emod in to rats 20 \u2013  30% of the dose was excreted in \nurine and the rest in faeces. Aloe- emodin was quickly metabolised to rhein, to an unknown metabolite \nand to conjugates of all three. In the plasma  about 10% of 14C -activity was identified as free aloe -\nemodin.  Maximum plasma values were reached 1.5 \u2013  3 h p.a. with 248 (male) and 441 (female) ng \nequivalents aleo- emodin/ml. Maximum concentrations in plasma were about 3 times higher than those \nin ovaries and 10 times higher than those in testes. Because of the low  activity concentrations in the \nreproductive organs TLC analysis was not possible. But if the metabolic profile of these organs is \nassumed to be the same as in plasma, concentrations of free aloe -emodin can be calculated to be \nmaximally about 2 -4 ng/g in t estes and 8 -10 ng/g in ovaries after an oral dose of 4.5 mg/kg. Only \nliver, kidney and intestinal tract showed higher concentrations than plasma. Terminal half -life (for \nradioactivity) in blood was about 50 h (Lang , 1993).  \nThe absorbed rhein anthrone is gl ucuronidised in the liver. One part of the glucuronides is excreted via \nthe urine and cause the yellow or red -brown discolouration of the urine. The other part is excreted via \nthe bile (Lemli et al. , 1980).  \nThe % absorption of aloin, aloe -emodin, and aloes in ranged from 5.51% to 6.60%, 6.60% to 11.32%, \nand 7.61% to 13.64%, respectively. Up to 18.15%, 18.18%, and 38.86% of aloin, aloe- emodin, and \naloesin, respectively, was absorbed as glucuronidated or sulfated form. These results suggest that a \nsignificant amount is transformed during absorption. These results provide information to establish an \nadequate intake level of aloe to maintain an effective plasma level (Park et al., 2009) . \nPharmacokinetic  studies by Lang ( 1993)  after oral administration of 14 C-aloe-emodin to male and \nfemale rats showed  that 20 -30% of the dose was excreted in the urine and the rest was excreted in \nthe faeces as rhein and conjugates. 10% of the radioactivity was identified as free aloe- emodin in the  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 22/56 \n plasma with a maximum peak at 1.5 -3.0 h after the administration. Only the liver, kidney and \ngastrointestinal tract showed higher concentrations than the plasma. The terminal half -life of the \nradioactivity in the blood was 50 h ours. \nAdministration of emodin to rabbits by i.v. bolus resulte d in a serum profile which could be well \ndescribed by a two -compartment model. The AUC of emodin was 518 micrograms.  min/ml, clearance \nwas 72.3 ml/min, and elimination half -life was 227 min which was much longer  than that reported in a \nprevious study. Oral  administration of emodin resulted in a very low serum concentration. Protein \nbinding of emodin was investigated by the equilibrium dialysis method. Emodin was found to be highly \nbound (99.6%) to serum protein (Liang et al. , 1995) . \nThe metabolism of emodin  (1, 3,  8-trihydroxy -6-methylanthraquinone), a compound present in \npharmaceutical preparations was studied in vitro. With rat liver microsomes, the formation of two emodin metabolites, omega -hydroxyemodin and 2- hydroxyemodin, was observed. The rates of \nformation of omega -hydroxyemodin were not different with microsomes from rats that had been \npretreated with inducers for different cytochrome P450 enzymes. Thus, the format ion of omega -\nhydroxyemodin seemed to be cataly sed by several cytochrome P450 enzymes at  low rates. The \nformation of 2 -hydroxyemodin was increased in liver microsomes from 3 -methylcholanthrene -\npretreated rats and was inhibited by alpha -naphthoflavone, by an anti -rat cytochrome P450 1A1/2 \nantibody, and, to a lesser degree, by an anti -rat cytoc hrome P450 1A1 antibody. The authors \nconcluded  the involvement of cytochrome P450 1A2 in the formation of this metabolite. However, \nother cytochrome P450 enzymes also seem ed to cataly se this reaction. The anthraquinone \nchrysophanol (1,8 -dihydroxy- 3-methyla nthraquinone) is transformed, in a cytochrome P450 -\ndependent oxidation, to aloe- emodin (1, 8- dihydroxy- 3-hydroxymethylanthraquinone) as the major \nproduct formed. The mutagenicity of the parent dihydroxyanthraquinones and their metabolites was \ncompared in t he in vitro micronucleus test in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. 2 -Hydroxyemodin \ninduced much higher micronucleus frequencies, compared with emodin. omega -Hydroxyemodin \ninduced lower micronucleus frequencies, compared with emodin. Aloe -emodin induced signific antly \nhigher micronucleus frequencies than did chrysophanol ( M\u00fcller  et al, .1998) . \nA study by Wang  et al. (2001) was performed to determine the effects of emodin  on cytochrome P450 \n(P450) -dependent monooxygenases of human lung adenocarcinoma CL5 cells. Treatment of CL5 cells \nwith 100 microM emodin  for 24 h induced benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylation, 7- ethoxyresorufin O -\ndeethylation, and 7- ethoxycoumarin O -deethylation activities of S9 fractions. Immunoblot analysis of \nCL5 S9 proteins revealed that emodin  induced proteins immunorelated to P450s 1A1 and 1B1. \nNorthern blot analysis of total cellular RNA showed that emodin  induced P450s 1A1 and 1B1 mRNA \nlevels in CL5 cells. These inductive effects on P450 monooxygenase activity, protein, and mRNA were \nconcentration - and time -dependent. Addition of emodin  to CL5 cell microM S9 inhibited its 7 -\nethoxycoumarin O -deethylation activity. Treatment of CL5 cells with 10 microM 3 -methylcholanthrene \nfor 24 h induced monooxygenase activity and P450s 1A1 and 1B1 proteins and mRNA l evels. \nTreatment of the lung cells with 100 microM emodin  or purpurin (1,2,4- trihydroxyanthraquinone) for \n24 h produced greater induction of P450s 1A1 and 1B1 mRNA than did anthraflavic acid (2,6-\ndihydroxyanthraquinone) or anthraquinone. The emodin  treatme nt induced P450s 1A1 and 1B1 mRNA \nin human lung carcinoma NCI -H322 and breast cancer MCF -7 cells. Emodin  induced P450 1A1, but not \n1B1, mRNA in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The authors concluded  that emodin  is an inducer of \nP450s 1A1 and 1B1 protein and mRN A in human lung adenocarcinoma CL5 cells. Modulation of P450 \nby emodin  may be an important factor affecting metabolism and toxicity of the hydroxyanthraquinone \nin humans (Wang  et al., 2001) . \nAssessor\u2019s conclusions on pharmacokinetic data :  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii suc cus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 23/56 \n Aloe-emodin is qu ickly oxidized to rhein and an unknown metabolite or it is conjugated. In rats less \nthan 10% of the orally administered total dose was recovered as unconjugated aloe -emodin. \nConcentrations found in gonads were below 10 ng/g ovary and below 5 ng/g testis af ter oral \napplication of 4 .5 mg/kg bw.  \n3.3.  Overview of available toxicological data regarding the herbal \nsubstance(s)/herbal preparation(s) and constituents thereof  \nAloe-emodin and e modin are naturally occurring anthraquinones present in the roots of a loe. \nAnthraquinone glycosides are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but are cleaved by gut \nbacteria to produce agly ka (such as emodin) that are more readily absorbed and are responsible for \nthe purgative properties of these preparations. There is ext ensive exposure to emodin and other \nanthraquinones resulting from the use of herb -based stimulant laxatives . Extracts from the roots, bark, \nand/or dried leaves of buckthorn, senna, cascara, aloe, frangula, rhubarb and rhamnus have been \nused as laxatives si nce ancient times and currently are widely used in the preparation of herbal \nlaxative preparations. Reports that 1,8 -dihydroxyanthraquinone, a commonly used laxative ingredient, \ncaused tumours  in the gastrointestinal tract of rats raised the possibility of  an association between \ncolorectal cancer and the use of laxatives containing anthraquinones. Because emodin , a \nhydroxyanthraquinone structurally similar to 1,8 -dihydroxyanthraquinone, is present in herbal \nlaxatives and was reported to be mutagenic in bact eria, it was considered a potential carcinogen and \nwas selected for in -depth evaluation.  \n3.3.1.  Single dose toxicity  \nData on herbal preparations  \nDosed water studies with aloe latex (HAD content unknown ) in mice revealed no acute toxicity in the \nleaf pulp at 500 mg/kg bw. At higher doses a decrease of central nervous system activity was \nobserved (Shah e t al.,1989)   \n3.3.2.  Repeat dose toxicity  \nData on herbal preparations  \nThe following study was designed to examine the effects of long -term (1.5 and 5.5 months) Aloe vera  \n(Aloe barbadensis ) ingestion on the growth, food intake and serum chemistry of Fischer 344 male rats. \nAloe vera  powders, produced by two different methods, were mixed with rat chow at selected \nconcentrations. Process A aloe was prepared from skinned aloe fil ets by homogenization followed by \nlyophilisation  and grinding to a fine powder; Process B aloe was prepared similarly except that the \nhomogenate was charcoal filtered prior to lyophilisation . Ingestion of Process A aloe at concentrations \ngreater than 1% wa s associated with diarrhoea and a decrease in weight gain. Ingestion of 1% Process \nA and both 1% and 10% Process B aloe had no adverse effect on body weight gain, food intake, gastrointestinal transit time and gross pathology. Serum chemistry was minimally  affected. The rats \ningesting 10% Process B aloe exhibited a slight, but significant increase in fluid intake. The results \nindicate that, although high concentrations of aloe should be avoided, ingestion of moderate levels \n(1%) of aloe from either process causes no apparent adverse effects in the rat  (Herlihy et al., 1998a) . \nThe aim of the next study was to examine the effects of long -term (1.5 and 5.5 months) Aloe vera \n(Aloe barbadensis) ingestion on a variety  of metabolic parameters of Fischer 344 male ra ts. Rats were \nfed Aloe vera  powders produced by two different methods and mixed with rat chow at various \nconcentrations. Process A Aloe  was prepared from skinned Aloe  filets by homogenization followed by  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 24/56 \n lyophilisation  and included in the rat chow at the 1 % level. Process B Aloe  was prepared similarly \nexcept the homogenate was charcoal filtered prior to lyophilisation  and mixed with chow at both 1% \nand 10% levels. Plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin were lower in the \nolder (7 m onth) Aloe fed than in the control rats of the same age. No statistically significant effects \nwere observed at the younger age (3 month). Aloe  feeding did not alter the plasma glucose and insulin \nlevels at any age and had only minor effects on the plasma corticosterone concentrations in the older \nrats. Serum lipid peroxides were decreased by Aloe  feeding, but the malondialdehyde production of \ncardiac and hepatic mitochondrial and microsomal membranes were unaffected. No alteration in \nprotein turnover was ob served in the Aloe  fed rats (Herlihy et al. , 1998b) . \nA one year study was conducted to evaluate the chronic toxicity of Aloe  arborescens Miller var. \nnatalensis Berger ( ALOE ) whole leaf powder in the diet at doses of 4.0%, 0.8% or 0.16% to groups of \nmale an d female Wistar Hannover rats. No deaths occurred at any dose level throughout the treatment \nperiod. Both sexes receiving 4.0% showed diarrhoea, with a reduced body weight gain. Increase of \nwhite blood cells  in the male 4.0% group, decrease of haemoglobin  in the female 4.0% and 0.8% \ngroups, decrease of inorganic  phosphate in the male 4.0% and 0.8% groups and female 4.0% group, and \ndecrease of Ca lcium  and alanine aminotra nsferase  in the female 4.0% group were observed. Relative \nkidney weight showed increase in  the female 4.0% group and relative heart and brain weights were \ndecreased in the female 4.0% and 0.8% groups. Histopathologically, both sexes receiving 4.0% showed severe sinus dilatation of ileocecal lymph nodes, and yellowish pigmentation of ileocecal lymph \nnodes and renal tubules. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for ALOE  was the 0.16% in \ndiet, which is equivalent to 87.7 and 109.7 mg/kg/day in males and females, respectively (Matsuda et \nal., 2008).  \nData on hydroxyanthracene derivatives  \nMale and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to emodin (at least 94% pure) in feed for \n16 days  and 14 weeks in the NTP Toxicology Programme (NTP , 2001) .  \n16-day study in rats: Groups of five male and five female rats were fed diets containing 0, 600, 2,000, \n5,500, 17,000, or 50,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 50, 170, \n480, 1,400, or 3,700 mg emodin/kg body weight to  males and  50, 160, 460, 1,250, or 2,000 mg/kg to \nfemales). Three female rats died before the end of the study. Mean body weights of males and females \nexposed to 5,500 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption \nby males and f emales receiving 17,000 or 50,000 ppm was decreased throughout the study. \nMacroscopic lesions were present in the kidney of rats exposed to 17,000 or 50,000 ppm.  \n16-day study in mice : Groups of five male and five female mice were fed diets containing 0, 600, \n2,000, 5,500, 17,000, or 50,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 120, 400, 1,200, or 3,800 mg/kg to males and 140, 530, 1,600, or 5,000 mg/kg to females; 50,000 ppm equivalents were not calculated due to high mortality). All mice exposed to 50,000 ppm died before the \nend of the study. Mice in the 17,000 ppm groups lost weight during the study. Feed consumption by \n5,500 ppm females was greater than that by the controls throughout the study. Macroscopic lesions \nwere present in  the gallbladder and kidney of mice exposed to 17,000 ppm.  \n14-week study in rats : Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 312.5, 625, \n1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 20, 40, 80, \n170, or 300 mg/kg to males and females). Mean body weights of males exposed to 2,500 ppm or greater and females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the controls. \nDuring the first week of the study, feed consumption by ma les exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm and \nfemales exposed to 5,000 ppm was less than that by the controls. Feed consumption by these groups  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 25/56 \n was similar to that by the controls for the remainder of the study. In rats exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 \nppm, there were in creases in platelet counts in males and females and segmented neutrophil counts in \nfemales. Total serum protein and albumin concentrations were decreased in females exposed to 2,500 \nor 5,000 ppm. Relative kidney weights of rats exposed to 1,250 ppm or grea ter and relative lung \nweights of rats exposed to 625 ppm or greater were significantly increased compared to the control groups. Relative liver weights were increased in females exposed to 625 ppm or greater. The estrous \ncycle length was significantly incr eased in females exposed to 1,250 or 5,000 ppm. All male rats \nexposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and all exposed female rats had pigment in the renal tubules; and the severity of pigmentation generally increased with increasing exposure concentration. The \nincidences of hyaline droplets in the cortical epithelial cytoplasm were increased in all groups of \nexposed males and in females exposed to 312.5, 625, or 1,250 ppm.  \n14-week study in mice : Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312. 5, \n625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 50, 100, 190, 400, or 800 mg/kg to males and 60, 130, 240, 500, or 1,100 mg/kg to females). All mice \nsurvived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of males exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm were \nsignificantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed groups was generally similar to that by the controls. Relative kidney weights of male mice exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater, relative \nlung weights of males exposed to 625 ppm or greater, and relative liver weights of female mice \nexposed to 625 ppm or greater were increased. The incidences and severities of nephropathy were \nincreased in males and females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater. The incidences  of renal tubule \npigmentation were significantly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm or greater and in females \nexposed to 1,250 ppm or greater.  \nDuring subchronic 90 day studies increased mortality, decreased red blood cell count and significant \nsperm dam age were noted  (Shah et al., 1989) . \n3.3.3.  Genotoxicity  \nData on herbal preparations  \nMorimoto et al. (1982) reported the results of the Ames test and the rec -assay for aloe crude extracts. \nThe investigators found neither water nor methanol extracts (no further in formation available) of aloe \nto have mutagenic activity  in Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA98 or TA100. A water extract of aloe \nwas reported to produce a positive effect in the rec -assay using Bacillus subtilis . \nMarquardt et al. (1987) (cited in the unpub lished report of Brusick (1994)) conducted a more thorough \nevaluation of  aloe-extract in the Ames test. A wide range of mutant strains (TA97, TA98, TA100, \nTA102, TA1535, TA1537, and TA1538) was included, and \u201cf aecalase\u201d (gut flora enzymes) was \nemployed in order to breakdown any potentially active glycosides. The results of this investigation \nwere negative with the maximum test concentration set at 3,000   \u00b5g/plate. Barbaloin was also \nreported negative in this study.  \nIn 1992 Cytotest Cell Research GmbH & Co. conducted a series of genetic tests using a batch of \ncommercial aloe -extract (also cited in the unpublished report of Brusick , 1994). The Ames test \n(employing TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, and TA100) only produced a mutagenic effect in strain TA1537 at 5,000 \u00b5g/plate without and with S9 mix but not at the next lower concentration of \n1,000  \u00b5g/plate.  \nA mammalian cell assay for gene mutation conducted in V79 cells showed no evidence of mutagenicity \nwith aloe extract in concentrations up to 1,000 \u00b5g/ml without S9 mix and up to 5,000 \u00b5g/ml with S9 \nmix.  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 26/56 \n Aloe-extract was shown to be clastogenic in CHO cells. In the absence of S9 mix, aloe -extract induce \nsignificant increases in chromosome breakage at concentration of 3,000 \u00b5g/ml (30 -hour harvest) and \n4,000 \u00b5g/ml ( 24-hour harvest). No clastogenicity was observed with S9 mix at concentrations up to \n4,750 \u00b5g/ml.  \nHowever, an in vivo  test for clastogenicity with aloe -extract (Bootman et al.  1987a, cited in the \nunpublished report of Brusick, 1994) produced no evidence of  a response in the mouse micronucleus \ntest at a maximum applicable dose of 1.5 mg /kg (orally).  \nData on hydroxyanthracene derivatives  \nIn vitro \nA variety of structurally related h ydroxyanthraquinone derivatives  (HAD ) were investigated in a test \nbattery for the evaluation of mutagenicity and cell- transforming activity. The tests were: Salmonella \ntyphimurium  mutagenicity assay, V79 -HGPRT mutagenicity assay, DNA -repair induction assay in \nprimary rat hepatocytes and the in  vitro transformation of C3H/M2 mouse fib roblasts. In Salmonella , \nmost of the tested compounds were mutagenic in strain TA1537, but only a few were active in other \nstrains. Among these were HA D with a hydroxymethyl group, such as lucidin and aloe -emodin. In V79 \ncells, only HA D with 2 hydroxy grou ps in the 1 .3 positions (1,3 -DHA, purpurin, emodin) or with a \nhydroxymethyl sidechain (lucidin and aloe -emodin) were mutagenic. The compounds found to be \nactive in V79 cells were also active in the DNA -repair assay and in the C3H/M2 transformation assay. \nThus, it appears that the genotoxicity of HA D is dependent on certain structural requirements. \n(Westendorf et al., 1990)  \nStudies were undertaken to elucidate further the mechanism by which emodin was converted into a \ndirect -acting mutagen to Salmonella typh imurium  TA1537 by the hepatic microsomes and the \nreconstituted cytochrome P -450 system. Emodin was activated into a mutagenic principle(s) in the \nreconstituted cytochrome P -450 system, and its mutagenicity was significantly higher with the fraction \nII (P-448 type) than the fraction I (P -450 type) derived from the hepatic microsomes of PCB -induced \nrats. Thin -layer chromatographic analysis revealed that the purified cytochrome II -a (maximal CO -\ndifferential spectrum at 448.0 nm and high -spin form) activity con verted emodin into 2- hydroxy-\nemodin, a direct -acting mutagen  (Tanaka et al., 1987) . \nThe hepatic microsomes derived from various animal species transformed emodin  (1,3,8 -trihydroxy -6-\nmethylanthraquinone) into an unidentified anthraquinone h, along with 2 -hydroxy- , 4-hydroxy-  and 7 -\nhydroxyemodins. TLC, UV, MS and NMR clarified this unidentified major metabolite as omega -hydroxy-\nemodin  (1,3,8 -trihydroxy -6-hydroxymethylanthraquinone). Among 7 animal species, the highest \nactivity to produce this omega -hydroxyemo din was observed in the hepatic microsomes of guinea pig \nand rat, followed by mouse and rabbit. The microsomal activity to convert emodin  into omega -\nhydroxyemodin was accelerated by the pre- treatment of animals with phenobarbital, and inhibited by \nSKF 525A . The microsomal hydroxylation reactions of the methyl residue and the anthraquinoid \nnucleus of emodin  were presumed to be catalysed  regiospecifically by multiple forms of cytochrome P -\n450. Omega -hydroxyemodin was not mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium  in the absence of S9, but \nexhibited mutagenicity in the presence of an activating system. This genotoxic potential was \ncomparable to 2 -hydroxyemodin, a direct -acting mutagen (Murakami  et al., 1987) . \nEmodin, danthron and aloe -emodin were tested in a number of  in vitro assay systems. All three \ncompounds induced tk -mutations in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. Induction of micronuclei also \noccurred in the same cell line, and was dose -dependent, with the potency ranking being danthron > \naloe-emodin > emodin. In a DNA  decatenation assay with a network of mitochondrial DNA of C. \nfasciulata, all three test compounds inhibited the topoisomerase II -mediated decatenation. Danthron  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 27/56 \n and aloe -emodin, but not emodin, increased the fraction of DNA moving into comet tails when te sted \nat concentrations around 50 microM in single -cell gel -electrophoresis assays (SCGE; comet assay). \nComet assays were also used in modified form to determine whether pre- treatment of the cells with \nthe test compounds would reduce the effects of etoposide, a potent topoisomerase II inhibitor. All \nthree test chemicals were effective in this pre- treatment protocol, with danthron again being the most \npotent (M\u00fcller et al. , 1996) .  \nGenetic toxicology studies were conducted with emodin (at least 94% pure) in Salmonella typhimurium  \nand cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells  (NTP,  2001) . Emodin was mutagenic in Salmonella \ntyphimurium  strain TA100 in the presence of S9 activation; no mutagenicity was detected in strain \nTA98, with or without S9. Chromosomal aberrations were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary \ncells treated with emodin, with and without S9. All three tested anthraquinones , emodin, aloe -emodin, \nand danthron, showed capabilities to inhibit the non -covalent binding of bisbenzimide Hoechst 33342 \nto isolated DNA and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells comparable to the topoisomerase II inhibitor and \nintercalator m -amsacrine. In a cell -free decatenation assay, emodin exerted a stronger, danthron a \nsimilar and aloe -emodin a weaker inhibition of topoisomerase II activity than m -amsacrine. Analysis of \nthe chromosomal extent of DNA damage induced by these anthraquinones  was performed in mouse \nlymphoma L5178Y cells. Anthraquinone -induced mutant cell clones showed similar chromosomal \nlesions when compared to the topoisomerase II inhibitors etoposide and m -amsacrine, but were \ndifferent from mutants induced by the DNA alkylator ethyl methanesulfonate (M\u00fcller , Stopper , Dekant , \n1998).  \nBrown and Dietrich (1979) reported that aloe -emodin was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium  strain \nTA1537. The mutagenicity was observed in the absence of S9 mix (terms of revertants per nmol test agent: 0.22; terms of revertants per plate less background for a given quantity (\u00b5g) of test agent: 22 \n(50 \u00b5g) without S9 activation, 13 (50 \u00b5g)  with S9 activation; 61 (100 \u00b5g) without S9 activation, 14 \n(100 \u00b5g) with S9 activation; 12 (250 \u00b5g) without S9 activation, 15 (250 \u00b5g) with S9 activation.  \nWestendorf et al. (1990) reported on the genotoxicity of aloe- emodin in a broad spectrum of in vitro \nassays. Positive results were obtained in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA1537, \nTA1538, TA98 and TA1978. In the HPRT test, no reproducible induction of mutations was obtained, \nwhile unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) and cell transformatio n was induced. These results led to the \nconclusion that aloe -emodin interacts with bacterial and mammalian DNA under certain in vitro \nconditions.  \nHeidemann et al. (1996) undertook in vitro experiments to clarify the genotoxic potential of the \nhydroxyanthra quinone aloe -emodin. The results confirmed that aloe -emodin is able to induce \nmutagenic effects in vitro.  \nIn vivo : \nToxicological data from in vitro investigations (Westendorf et al.,  1990) indicated that the \nhydroxyanthraquinones, emodin and aloe -emodin, m ight represent a genotoxic risk. However, results \nfrom in vivo  investigations (Heidemann et al.,  1996) did not indicate a genotoxic potential.  \nA study by Mengs et al.  (1997)  was performed to investigate the potential of emodin  (1,3,8 -\ntrihydroxy -6-methylan thra-quinone) to induce  micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs). Mice \nof both genders received a single oral dose of 2,000 mg emodin /kg and were killed 24 and 48 h later.  \nBone marrow cells were collected from 5 males and 5 females and 2000 PCEs per animal were scored \nfor the presence of micronuclei. There was no enhancement in the frequency of micronuclei at both preparation intervals when compared to the negative controls. Blood level examinations confirmed the \nsystemic availability of emodin . Plasma levels of up to 190 micrograms emodin /ml represented  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 28/56 \n concentrations being in the concentration range that induced positive responses in several genotoxicity \ncell culture assays (Mengs et al., 1997).  \nGenetic toxicology studies were conducted with emodin  (at least 94% pure) in rat and mouse bone \nmarrow cells and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes (NTP,  2001). Three separate in vivo  \nmicronucleus tests were performed with emodin. A male rat bone marrow micronucleus test, with \nemodin administered by three i ntraperitoneal injections, gave negative results. Results of acute \nexposure (intraperitoneal injection) micronucleus tests in bone marrow and peripheral blood \nerythrocytes of male and female mice were negative. In a peripheral blood micronucleus test on mi ce \nfrom a 14 -week study, negative results were seen in male mice, but a weakly positive response was \nobserved in similarly exposed females.  \nHeidemann et al. (1996) undertook in vivo  experiments (micronucleus assay in bone marrow cells of \nNMRI mice; chromosome aberration assay in bone marrow cells of Wistar rats; mouse spot test \n[DBA/2J x NMRI]) to clarify the genotoxic potential of the hydroxyanthraquinone aloe -emodin. No \nindication of a mutagenic activity of aloe -emodin was found. Information about a possible reaction of \naloe-emodin with DNA was derived  from an in vivo  UDS assay. Hepatocytes of aloe -emodin treated \nmale Wistar rats did not show DNA damage via repair synthesis. These available data suggest that \naloe-emodin is able to interact with DNA under c ertain in vitro conditions. However, in vivo  the results \ndid not indicate a genotoxic potential. Therefore the authors assume that a genotoxic risk for man \nmight be unlikely.  \n3.3.4.  Carcinogenicity  \nData on herbal preparations  \nA 2 years  carcinogenicity  study  of Aloe, Aloe arborescens  Miller  var. natalensis Berger, a food additive \nwas conducted for assessment of toxicity and carcinogenic potential in the diet at doses of 4% or 0.8% in groups of male and female Wistar  Hannover  rats. The whole leaf powder of Aloe arb orescens, the \nsame grade used as a food additive  was mixed at concentrations of 0.0% (Control), 0.8%, and 4.0% \ninto powdered basal diet and pelleted. The concentrations of aloenin and aloin (barbaloin and \nisobarbaloin) in the whole leaf powder of Aloe arborescens and the pelleted diet were measured and \nevaluated using high -performance liquid chromatography. The concentrations of aloin and aloenin in \nthe whole leaf powder after storage for 2 weeks were 0.83% and 1.91%, respectively. The concentrations of alo in and aloenin in the pelleted diet after 2 weeks of storage at room temperature \nwere 0.0009% and 0.0022% for the 0.8% diet and 0.0179% and 0.0663% for the 4.0% diet. Both \nsexes receiving 4% showed diarrhoea , with loss of body weight gain. The survival rate in the 4% \nfemale group was significantly increased compared with control females after 2 y ears. Haematological \nand biochemical examination showed increase of RBC, Hb, and Alb in the 4% males. The cause of these increases could conceivably have been dehydration through diarrhoea . AST and Na were \nsignificantly decreased in the males receiving 4%, and Cl was significantly decreased in both 4% and 0.8% males. A/G was significantly increased in the 4% females, and Cl was significantly decreased (0.8%) in the f emale group. Histopathologically, both sexes receiving 4% showed severe sinus \ndilatation of ileocecal lymph nodes, and yellowish pigmentation of ileocecal lymph nodes and renal tubules. Adenomas or adenocarcinomas in the cecum, colon , and rectum were obser ved in 4% males \nbut not in the 0.8% and control male groups. Similarly, in females, adenomas in the colon  were also \nobserved in the 4% but not 0.8% and control groups. In conclusion, Aloe, used as a food additive, \nexerted equivocal  carcinogenic potential a t 4% high- dose level on colon  in the 2 years  carcinogenicity  \nstudy  in rats. The authors concluded that a loe is not carcinogenic at nontoxic -dose levels and that  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), f olii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 29/56 \n carcinogenic potential in at 4% high- dose level on colon is probably due to irritation of the intestinal \ntract by diarrh oea (Yokohira et al., 2009)  \nThe National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) conducted 14 -day, 13- week, and 2 years \ncarcinogenesis studies on the leaf extracts of Aloe vera  plants. The Aloe vera  plant extracts used in \nthese st udies were obtained from freshly harvested Aloe barbadensis  Miller plants and were freeze-\ndried (6% moisture) and gamma -irradiated to preserve quality. No other additives were used in their \npreparation. Solutions of non -decolorized extracts of Aloe vera  leaves (DER and HAD content unknown) \nwere added to the drinking water to groups of rats and mice for 2 years. Groups of 48 rats received \nsolutions containing 0.5%  (= 0.62 g Aloe vera  whole -leaf extract per kg bw per day, 1% or 1.5% of \nAloe vera  extract in th e drinking water, and groups of mice received solutions containing 1%, 2%, or \n3% = 11. 8 g Aloe leaf extract/kg bw/day of whole leaf Aloe vera  extract. Similar groups of animals \nwere given plain drinking water and served as the control groups. At the end of  the study tissues from \nmore than 40 sites were examined for every animal. In all groups of rats and mice receiving the Aloe \nvera extract, the rates of hyperplasia in the large intestine were markedly increased compared to the \ncontrol animals. There were a lso increases in hyperplasia in the small intestine in rats receiving the \nAloe vera  extract, increases in hyperplasia of the stomach in male and female rats and female mice \nreceiving the Aloe vera  extract, and increases in hyperplasia of the mesenteric lym ph nodes in male \nand female rats and male mice receiving the Aloe vera  extract. In addition, cancers of the large \nintestine occurred in male and female rats given the Aloe vera  extract, though none had been seen in \nthe control groups of rats for this and other studies at this laboratory. The authors concluded that \nnondecolorized Aloe vera  caused cancers of the large intestine in male and female rats and also caused \nhyperplasia of the large intestine, small intestine, stomach, and lymph nodes in male and fem ale rats. \nAloe vera  extract also caused hyperplasia of the large intestine in male and female mice and \nhyperplasia of the mesenteric lymph node in male mice and hyperplasia of the stomach in female mice \n(Boudreau  et al., 2013) . \nAssessor\u00b4s Comment regarding  Boudreau et al. , 2013:  \nThe studies are not unambiguously  transferable to humans, due to lacking extract specifications . A \ndose effect relation is therefore debatable since the HAD content of the whole leaf aloe extract, its \ncomposition  and the posology ar e unknown. In this 2 years rat study, treatment (max. dose 11.8  g \nAloe vera leaves extract/kg bw/day) related neoplasms were limited to the large intestine and occurred \nas adenomas and carcinomas in the ileocecal junction, cecum, and the ascending and tran sverse \ncolons of the male and female rats. The neoplasms were confined within the mucosal wall of the large intestine and did not metastasize to regional mesenteric lymph nodes or more distant sites. However, in association with the whole set of existing d ata they contribute to the concern about genotoxicity and \ncarcinogenicity of anthraquinones.  \nThe effects of long -term Aloe vera  ingestion on age -related diseases were investigated using male \nspecific pathogen -free (SPF) Fischer 344 rats. Experimental animals were divided into four groups: \nGroup A, the control rats fed a semi- synthetic diet without Aloe vera ; Group B, rats fed a diet \ncontaining 1% freeze- dried Aloe vera  blended filet; Group C, rats fed a diet containing 1% charcoal -\nprocessed, freeze- dried Aloe vera  filet; and Group D, rats fed the control diet and given whole leaf \ncharcoal -processed Aloe vera  (0.02%) in the drinking water. This study demonstrates that life -long \nAloe vera  ingestion produced neither harmful effects nor deleterious changes. In a ddition, Aloe vera  \ningestion appeared to be associated with some beneficial effects on age- related diseases. Groups B \nexhibited significantly less occurrence of multiple causes of death, and a slightly lower incidence of \nfatal chronic nephropathy compared with Group A rats. Groups B and C rats showed the trend, slightly \nlower incidences of thrombosis in the cardiac atrium than Group A rats. Therefore, these findings  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species,  mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 30/56 \n suggest that life -long Aloe vera  ingestion does not cause any obvious harmful and deleteriou s side \neffects (Ikeno et al. , 2002) .  \nData on hydroxyanthracene derivatives  \nIn a model of dimethylhydrazine(DMH) -induced colorectal tumours in male mice neither aloin - nor \nsennoside -enriched diets (0.03% corresponding to 100 mg aloin or sennoside /kg/day) promoted \nincidence and growth of adenomas and carcinomas after 20 weeks as evidenced by different endpoint \nparameters, based on a macroscopic evaluation and microscopic examination. In the DMH -induced \ntumour model a tumour incidence appeared which allowed an increasing or decreasing effect to be \ndetected after additional treatment, i.e. a 50% incidence of tumour -bearing animals. With regard to \nhepatotoxic and nephrotoxic effects, DMH itself enhanced plasma levels of GPT and SDH which were further significan tly increased by co administration  of aloin. The anthranoids alone had no effect. No \neffects on serum electrolyte concentrations were observed after any of the treatments (Siegers et al. , \n1993).  \nA free -floating cell line has been established from a metasta tic lesion of a Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) \npatient. The cell line was characterized by immunocytochemical reactions with antibodies against the epithelial and neuroendocrine antigens: cytokeratin 20, neuron -specific enolase, chromogranin A, \nneurofilament protein, synaptophysin , and calcitonin. Karyotype analysis of the MCC cells showed \ndeletion in chromosomes 3 and 7, loss of chromosome 10, and several translocations in other \nchromosomes. No mutation was detected in the TP53 gene, after analysing  the complete coding \nregion. Growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor -beta, and \nnerve and epidermal growth factors had no effect on the proliferation of the cells. The differentiation -\ninducing agents sodium butyrate and dimet hyl sulfoxide, especially the former, markedly inhibited the \nproliferation of the MCC cells. Aloe -emodin, significantly inhibited the growth of MCC cells. Aloe -emodin \nhas been reported to be nontoxic for normal cells but to possess specific toxicity for ne uroect odermal \ntumor cells ( Wasserman et al., 2002).  \nIn 2001 the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \npublished a technical report on toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of emodin.  \n2-years study in rats: G roups of 65 male and 65 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 280, 830, or \n2,500 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 110, 320, or 1,000 mg/kg to \nmales and 120, 370, or 1,100 mg/kg to females). Ten male and ten female rats from  each group were \nnecropsied at 6 months. Blood samples from five male and five female rats in each group were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months for plasma emodin concentrations; these rats were necropsied at 12 months. Survival, b ody weights, and f eed consumption: Survival of exposed males and females was \nsimilar to that of the controls. The mean body weights of rats in the 2,500 ppm groups were less than those of the controls beginning at week 2 of the study. Feed consumption by exposed groups was similar t o that by the controls throughout the study. Pathology f indings: Three Zymbal's gland \ncarcinomas were observed in female rats exposed to 2,500 ppm. This incidence exceeded the range observed for current historical controls and was considered an equivocal f inding. At the 6 - and 12-\nmonth interim evaluations and at 2 years, emodin -related increases in the incidences of renal tubule \nhyaline droplets occurred in all exposed groups. The incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all e xposed groups of males at 2 years. There were negative trends in the \nincidences of mononuclear cell leukaemia  in male and female rats, and the incidences in the 2,500 \nppm groups were significantly decreased. In females exposed to 2,500 ppm, the incidence w as below \nthe historical control range; the incidence in males exposed to 2,500 ppm was at the lower end of the \nhistorical control range.   \n \nAssessment report on Aloe bar badensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 31/56 \n 2-years study in mice : Groups of 60 male mice were fed diets containing 0, 160, 312, or 625 ppm \nemodin (equivalent to a verage daily doses of approximately 15, 35, or 70 mg/kg). Groups of 60 female \nmice were fed diets containing 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of \napproximately 30, 60, or 120 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Ten male and ten female m ice from each group \nwere necropsied at 12 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption Survival and mean body weights of exposed males and females were similar to those of the controls. No differences in \nfeed consumption were noted between exposed and control groups. Pathology Findings: Low \nincidences of renal tubule adenoma and carcinoma occurred in exposed male mice; these incidences \nincluded one carcinoma each in the 312 and 625 ppm groups. Renal tubule neoplasms are rare in male \nmice, and their presence in these groups suggested a possible association with emodin exposure. At \nthe 12- month interim evaluation, the severity of nephropathy was slightly increased in males exposed \nto 625 ppm. Also at 12 months, the severity of nephropathy increased fro m minimal in the lower \nexposure groups to mild in females exposed to 1,250 ppm; the incidence in this group was significantly increased compared to the control group. At 2 years, the severities of nephropathy were slightly \nincreased in males exposed to 625 ppm and females exposed to 1,250 ppm. The incidences of \nnephropathy were significantly increased in all exposed groups of females. At the 12- month interim \nevaluation, the incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed \ngroups of males and in females exposed to 625 or 1,250 ppm. The severities increased with increasing \nexposure concentration. At 2 years, the incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly \nincreased in all exposed groups; severities increased wi th increasing exposure concentration.  \nConclusion by the \u201cNational Toxicology Program\u2019s Board of Scientific Counselors\u2019 Technical Reports \nReview Subcommittee\u201d:  \n\u2022 The studies give no evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in male rats and female mice, and  \nequivocal evidence in female rats and male mice.  \n\u2022 In view of conflicting results on genotoxicity, it was noted the first pass effect and need for \nmetabolic activation suggesting a metabolite as the genotoxic form. The metabolite 2 -\nhydroxyemodin act s as the  genotoxin (NTP , 2001).  \nThe occurrence of intestinal tumours in rats has been reported by Mori et al.  (1985)  following the \ndietary administration of chrysazin (1,8 -dihydroxy- 9, 10- anthracenedione = danthrone) for 16 months \nat the concentration of 1%. Twelv e out of 18 rats survived more than one year. Of these, 7 rats \ndeveloped intestinal tumours of the colon or caecum, adenomas or adenocarcinomas. Besides these \nneoplasms, focal hyperplastic lesions of the glandular epithelium of the colon and caecum were \nfrequently encountered in treated animals both with and without intestinal tumours. In the liver of \nseveral rats, some histological changes such as focal necrosis, fibrosis, cystic lesions and bile duct \nproliferation were seen.  \nAnother carcinogenicity testin g of chrysazin was performed in 1986 (Mori et al. ) in C3H/HeN mice by \ndietary administration for 540 days at a concentration of 0.2% since mice did not tolerate larger doses \n(1% and 0.5%). All the mice that were given the chemical and survived more than 500 days, developed adenomatous hyperplasia with  cystic glands of the caecum and colon. These lesions were \nnot seen in animals of the control group. Some of the hyperplastic lesions were difficult to distinguish from true neoplasms. Similar hyperplastic lesions were also recognised together with the carcinomas in rats. Carcinogen -induced hyperplastic lesions have been regarded as an important precursor change \nfor malignancies in various experimental models.  The authors therefore stated that the lesions \nobtain ed here appear to indicate a certain carcinogenic potency of chrysazin in mice, and mouse \nintestine may be less sensitive than rat intestine to the carcinogenic action of the chemical. The \nincidence of hepatocellular carcinoma of mice given chrysazin (4/17 ) was significantly higher than that  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 32/56 \n of the controls (0/19). However, benign hepatocellular neoplasms were also seen in the animals of the \ncontrol group. The authors therefore concluded that chrysazin enhanced the progression of \nspontaneously occurring  hepatocarcinogenesis.  \nDanthron and 8 other hydroxyanthraquinones were comparatively investigated by W\u00f6lfle et al.  (1990)  \nfor activities associated with tumour promotion, such as stimulation of cell proliferation and \nenhancement of malignant transformation. Th e in vivo treatment of primary rat hepatocytes with \ndanthron, aloe -emodin, chrysophanol, and rhein resulted in a 2 -3-fold increase of DNA synthesis; \nlucidin and purpurin were less active, and emodin, purpuroxanthin, and alizarin were essentially inactive. In addition, danthron, rhein, and chrysophanol, but not alizarin, enhanced transformation of \nC3H/M2 mouse fibroblasts initiated by N -methyl -N\u2019-nitro- N-nitrosoguanidine or 3 -methylcholanthrene. \nThe results of these in vitro studies suggest that hydroxyanthr aquinones, possessing 2 hydroxy groups \nin 1,8 -positions, e.g. danthron, rhein, and chrysophanol, may have tumour -promoting activities.  \nThe aim of the study of Sch\u00f6rkhuber et al.  (1998)  was to demonstrate the effect of the 1,8-\ndihydroxyanthraquinone (DHA) -laxatives, danthrone, rhein, aloe -emodin and sennidine, on colorectal \ntumour cells, because available information on their implication in colon carcinogenesis was still \ninconclusive. In SW480 carcinoma cultures, dose -dependent induction of urokinase secreti on into the \nmedium was the predominant effect. Simultaneously, cell numbers  were decreased by DHA -aglyka, but \nnot by sennoside , nor the biphenylic laxative bisacodyl. DNA synthesis was not similarly reduced: 0.4 -4 \n\u00b5M danthrone and sennidine even stimulated  5-bromo -2\u2019-desoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake into DNA. When \nuptake was normalised to cell number, danthrone and sennidine doubled BrdU uptake/106 cells, 18 \u00b5M \nrhein and 0.7 \u00b5M aloe- emodin induced increases of 37 and 50%, respectively. This may at least \npartiall y be due to selective resistance of S -phase cells to DHA -caused cell loss. In VACO235 adenoma \ncells, sennidine and aloe -emodin did not affect urokinase secretion, but stimulated growth. Both cell \nnumbers and DNA synthesis were increased. In contrast to SW4 80 carcinoma cells, VACO235 cells \nwere also sensitive to sennoside and bisacodyl. No effects of DHA were observed in normal colorectal epithelial cells. The biological effects were preceded by specific phosphorylation of cellular proteins with \nmolecular we ights of 110, 78, 63, 57 kDa, indicating the specific induction of a cellular signalling \ncascade by the laxatives.  \n3.3.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity  \nData on herbal preparations  \nNo teratogenic or foetotoxic effects were seen in rats after oral treatme nt with aloe extract (up to 1000 \nmg/kg) or aloin A ( up to 200 mg/kg) (WHO , 1999). The pregnant rats were treated between the 10th \nand 13th day of the gestational period. A caesarean section was done on the 21st day post conception.  \nThe gastrointestinal tr act of neonates is sensitive to dietary manipulations. The effects of orally \nadministered extra cts of Aloe  vera (ethanolic extract and aqueous extract; DER and HAD unknown) in \nunweaned rats were investigated. The aqueous and alcohol (ethanol) extracts were  prepared from \nfresh Aloe vera  leaves. Briefly, 370 g of freshly cut leaves of Aloe vera  were mixed with either 100 ml \nof 70% ethanol or 100 ml of distilled water and crushed in a blender, agitated on a shaker incubator \nfor 12 hours, filtered through filte r paper and then lyophilized in a lyophiliser. The yield for alcohol \nextract was 1.5% and for aqueous extracts it was 1.2%. Six day old Sprague- Dawley rats were \ngavaged with aqueous or alcohol extracts of Aloe  vera (low dose 50mg/ kg or high dose 500mg/ kg) \ndaily for eight days. All data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD and analy sed by one way ANOVA. Pups \nreceiving high doses of either extract had a significantly higher body mass gain than the group receiving lower dose (p < 0.05). Tibial length was significantly increased in the high dose aqueous extract group (15- 26%). The differences in growth could not be attributed to circulating insulin -like  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 33/56 \n growth factor -1 as the levels were not significantly different. The caecum was significantly enlarged in \nthe rats that received the high doses of both extracts. Although, there was no significant difference in \nthe non- fasting plasma concentration of glucose and triglycerides, the hepatic lipid and glycogen \ncontent were significantly higher (p < 0.001) for the high dose aqu eous extract group. The plasma \nalanine transaminase was not affected by the treatments, however the high doses of the extracts significantly increased plasma alkaline phosphatase activity. Short term administration of Aloe  vera \nextracts resulted in growth promotion, enhanced hepatic storage of metabolic substrates, increased \nALP possibly in relation to bone growth and caused hypertrophy of the caecum of neonatal rats. (Beya \net al., 2012) . \nData on hydroxyanthracene derivatives  \nAfter intragastric administration of sennosides at a dose of 2,  10, 20, 50, 100 mg/kg to pregnant rats \nand rabbits there was no evidence of any embryolethal, teratogenic or fetotoxic action. Furthermore, \nsennosides had no effect on the postnatal development of young animals, on the rear ing behaviour of \nmother animals or on male or female fertility  (Mengs , 1986) . \nThe effects of sennosides on uterine motility were evaluated by electromyography in healthy adult \newes between day 70 and 120 of pregnancy to assess possible disturbances of the physiological \npattern of contractility and eventual risks in pregnancy maintenance. At this stage of pregnancy, the \novine genital tract presented motility episodes of 6 -8 min duration  occurring at approximately hourly \nintervals. A dose -range study (10- 160 mg/kg intracolonically) in 2 ewes showed that diarrhoea  was \nsystematically obtained with doses greater than 20 mg/kg and was connected with a marked \ndepression of both ileum and spiral colon motility. A standard dose of 60 mg/kg administered intracolonically 1 -3 times at 7 - to 10-day intervals to 12 ewes was used in the uterus studies. The \nexperiments showed that sennosides did not stimulate uterine motility in the pregnant ewe, but slightly depressed it in some ewes. Cervix motility was never influenced. I ntolerance of the drug was \nobserved in half of the animals resulting mainly in anorexia or weakness and confirming a specific \ntoxicity of senna in ruminants which is not known from other species. These effects were not related to \nuterine motility and pregn ancy maintenance was normal in all ewes (Garcia- Villar et al., 1988) . \nAnimal experiments demonstrated that placental passage of rhein is small. Aloe -emodin is quickly \noxidised to rhein and an unknown metabolite, or conjugated.  \nEmodin was administered in feed to timed -mated  Sprague- Dawley (CD) rats (0, 425, 850, and 1700 \nppm; gestational day [GD] 6 -20), and Swiss Albino (CD -1) mice (0, 600, 2500 or 6000 ppm; GD 6-\n17). Ingested dose was 0, 31, 57, and approximately 80- 144 mg emodin/kg/day (rats) and 0, 94, 391, \nand 1005 mg emodin/kg/day (mice). Timed- mated animals (23 -25/group) were monitored for body \nweight, feed/water consumption, and clinical signs. At termination (rats: GD 20; mice: GD 17), \nconfirmed pregnant dams (21- 25/group) were evaluated for clinical signs: body, liver, kidney, and \ngravid uterine weights, uterine contents, and number of corpora lutea. Fetuses were weighed, sexed, \nand examined for external, visceral, and skeletal malformations/variations. There were no maternal \ndeaths. In rats, maternal  body weight, weight gain during treatment, and corrected weight gain \nexhibited a decreasing trend. Maternal body weight gain during treatment was significantly reduced at \nthe high dose. In mice, maternal body weight and weight gain was decreased at the hi gh dose. \nPrenatal mortality, live litter size, fetal sex ratio, and morphological development were unaffected in \nboth rats and mice. At the high dose, rat average fetal body weight per litter was unaffected, but was \nsignificantly reduced in mice. The rat m aternal lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) was 1700 \nppm; the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 850 ppm. The rat developmental toxicity \nNOAEL was > or = 1700 ppm. A LOAEL was not established. In mice, the maternal toxicity LOAEL was  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 34/56 \n 6000 ppm and the NOAEL was 2500 ppm. The developmental toxicity LOAEL was 6000 ppm (reduced \nfetal body weight) and the NOAEL was 2500 ppm  (Jahnke et al., 2004) . \nBased on the evaluation of developmental toxicity of emodin in rats and mice, the following values \nhave been calculated (Jahnke  et al., 2004):  \nMice maternal toxicity  LOAEL= 1005 mg/kg/day  NOAEL=391 mg/kg/day  \nMice developmental toxicity  LOAEL= 1005 mg/kg/day  NOAEL=391 mg/kg/day  \nRats maternal toxicity  LOAEL= 80 -144 mg/kg/day  NOAEL=57 mg/kg/day  \nRats de velopmental toxicity   NOAEL> 80 -144 mg/kg/day  \n3.3.6.  Local tolerance  \nNot applicable  \n3.3.7.  Other special studies  \nNot applicable  \n3.3.8.  Conclusions  \nOverall, available data are insufficient and the results of available investigations are not consistent. \nHowever, data are not a ppropriate to fully exclude the concern on genotoxic and carcinogenic \npotential. Therefore, use during pregnancy and lactation is contraindicated, although no irreversible \nchanges or risks have been observed regarding reproduction toxicity in vivo  when usi ng the normal \nrecommended doses. Other treatments like behavioural modification, dietary changes and use of bulk forming agents should be the first actions taken during pregnancy and lactation to treat constipation. \nSecondly, it is regarded appropriate to restrict the duration of use to a maximum of one week.  \nUse during lactation is contraindicated as there are insufficient data on the excretion of metabolites in \nbreast milk, too. Investigations with a \u201cstandardised senna laxative\u201d, which also contains Plan tago \novata seeds/husks as bulk substances, showed that small amounts of active metabolites (rhein) are \nexcreted in breast milk. No laxative effect in breast fed babies has been reported (Faber P . and \nStrenge- Hesse A ., 1988). Aloe- emodin is quickly oxidised  to rhein and an unknown metabolite or \nconjugated. Data on excretion of aloe -emodin and emodin  via milk on any species are lacking.  \n3.4.  Overall conclusions on non -clinical data \nPharma codynamic data regarding the A loe vera  latex containing preparations support their short term \nwell-established use as a laxative. NTP Toxicology programme did not identify any canc erogenicity in \nrecommended doses for emodin.  The metabolite 2- hydroxyemodin acts as the genotoxin.  The \ncorresponding  NTP programme on an A loe vera  whole leaf extract (without extract specification , HAD \ncontent unknown) showed in high posologies intestinal carcinomata . The relevance for humans is \nunclear.   \nAs there is limited  information on reproductive and developmental toxicity, but a potential genotoxici ty \nand carcinogenicity the use during pregnancy and l actation is contraindicated . The duration of use is \nlimited to a maximum of one week.   \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hyb rids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 35/56 \n 4.  Clinical Data  \n4.1.  Clinical pharmacology  \n4.1.1.  Overview of pharmacodynamic data regarding the herbal \nsubstance(s)/preparation(s)  including data on relevant constituents  \nLaxative effect  \nConstipation is said to be present when passed stools are of hard consistency and when evacuation of \nfaeces is too difficult, too infrequent and irregular. The physiological range for frequency of bowel \nmovements is wide, extending from three times daily to once every 2 to 3 days. In the pathogenesis of constipation the colon plays a key role because this is where the contents of the gut remain for 24 \u2013  48 \nhours. During this period the liquid contents  from the small intestine are converted into faeces by \nabsorption of water and electrolytes in response to the action of bacteria. These functions are \ndependent on the interplay of peristaltic processes which mix the contents and the normal coordination \nof the anorectal muscles during defaecation. A disturbance involving any of these individual areas may \nlead to constipation. In this context, functional disturbances are far more common than those of an \norganic origin. In addition, assessment is problematic because the symptoms are perceived differently \nby the individuals affected ( Ewe 1994, Gabler 1994), due to different concepts of what normal bowel \nhabits are.   \nAloe dried juice belongs to the stimulant laxatives. Aloe -emodin -9-anthrone is the main active \nmetabolite, which acts specifically on the colon ( Ishii et al. 1990).  \nProlonged use of aloe containing preparations is associated with watery diarrhoea leading to electrolyte imbalance and the increased loss of potassium can lead to hypokalaemia. The increased loss of \npotassium is largely the result  of compensatory reaction to the  excessive loss of sodium, which induces \na compensatory production of aldosterone that can exacerbate the hypokalemic condition and increase \nrenin production (Mascolo et al.,  2004).  \n4.1.2.  Overview of pharmak okinetic data regarding the herbal \nsubstance(s)/preparation(s) including data on relevant constituents  \nThe ESCOP  monograph mentioned an unpublished research report of a human pharmacokinetic study \nin 6 healthy volunteers (ref. 39 in 3).  After oral admin istration of aloes (equivalent to 16.4 mg of \nhydroxyanthracene derivates) for 7 days, aloe -emodin was detected as a metabolite in the plasma only \nsporadically and with maximum concentrations of less than 2 ng/ml. In the same study rhein wa s \ndetected in the plasma in concentrations ranging from 6 -28 ng/ml after single dose administration. In \n7-day administration there was no evidence of accumulation of rhein.  \nIn the pharmak okinetic study by Krumbiegel  and Schulz ( 1993)  therapeutic doses of t wo laxatives \n(Agiolax and Sennatin) were repeatedly administered to 10 healthy volunteers  (18-32 years, male)  in \na two -way change -over design. 4 single doses of Agiolax (6.3 g granulate containing 13,23 mg total \nanthronoids, including 7,62 mg potential rhein and 0,378 mg aloe- emodin) or Sennatin (2 tablets \ncontaining 20,36 mg total anthronoids including 13,06 mg potential rhein  0,4 mg potential aloe-\nemodin) were given to the volunteers at 24 h intervals. Blood samples were collected up to 96 h after the firs t dose, and plasma levels of total aloe -emodin and rhein were determined simultaneously with a \nsensitive (lower limit of quantification: 0.5 ng aloe -emodin and 2.5 ng rhein per millilitre plasma) and \nspecific fluorometric HPLC method. Aloe -emodin was not d etectable in any plasma sample of any \nsubject. Rhein concentration time courses showed highest levels of 150 -160 ng/ml and peak maxima  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 36/56 \n at 3-5 h and 10- 11 h after dosing probably according to absorption of free rhein and rhein released \nfrom prodrugs (e.g. s ennosides) by bacterial metabolism, respectively.  \nThe absorbed rhein anthrone is glucuronidised in the liver. One part of the glucuronides is excreted via \nthe urine and cause the yellow or red -brown discolouration of the urine. The other part is excreted v ia \nthe bile ( Lemli et al. 1980; Stolk and Hoogtanders 1999).  \n4.2.  Clinical efficacy  \nLaxative effect  \nConstipation is said to be present when passed stools are of hard consistency and when evacuation of faeces is too difficult, too infrequent and irregular. The p hysiological range for frequency of bowel \nmovements is wide, extending from three times daily to once every 2 to 3 days. In the pathogenesis of \nconstipation the colon plays a key role because this is where the contents of the gut remain for 24 \u2013  48 \nhours. During this period the liquid contents from the small intestine are converted into faeces by \nabsorption of water and electrolytes in response to the action of bacteria. These functions are \ndependent on the interplay of peristaltic processes which mix the c ontents and the normal coordination \nof the anorectal muscles during defaecation. A disturbance involving any of these individual areas may \nlead to constipation. In this context, functional disturbances are far more common than those of an \norganic origin. I n addition, assessment is problematic because the symptoms are perceived differently \nby the individuals affected ( Ewe 1994;  Gabler 1994), due to different concepts of what normal bowel \nhabits are.  \nThe prevalence of constipation in  the worldwide general population ranged from  0.7% to 79% (median \n16%). The epidemiology of constipation in  children was investigated and prevalence rate was between \n0.7% and 29.6% (median 12%) (Mugie et al.  2011).  \nAloe dried juice belongs to the stimulant laxatives. Aloe -emodin -9-anthrone is the main active \nmetabolite, which acts specifically on the colon ( Ishii et al. 1990).  \n4.2.1.  Dose response studies \nThere are no dose- finding studies available.  \nThe recommended dosage as a laxative for adults, elderly and adolescents over 12 years (10 \u2013 30 mg \nhydroxyanthracene derivatives only once daily at night) is supported by experts\u2019 opinions and by \nclinical investigations with other anthranoid -containing laxatives like senna preparations. The German \nCommission E monograph indicates a daily dose of 20 \u2013  30 mg hydroxyanthracene derivatives \ncalculated as aloin but recommends that the pharmaceutical form must allow lower dosages than the \nusual daily dose.  \nThe ESCOP monograph and the WHO monograph recommend 10 \u2013  30 mg hydroxyanthracene \nderivates.  \nThis dosage recommendation is also given in consideration of the toxicological data, which were \nevaluated and led to pharmacovigilance actions in Germany for anthranoid -containing laxatives in \n1996.  \nThrough the individual product information (especially the pa ckage leaflet), patients should be \ninformed that the correct individual dose is the smallest required to produce a comfortable soft- formed \nmotion.   \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 37/56 \n It is normally sufficient to take an anthranoid -containing laxative up to two to three times a week \n(Hitzenbe rger et al. 1999).  \n4.2.2.  Clinical studies (case studies and clinical trials)  \nThere are no clinical studies, which evaluate the efficacy of barbados aloes or cape aloes in patients \nwith occasional constipation.  \nKoch (1995) evaluated  the laxative effect of aloin in experiments on herself. Neither a dose of 20 mg \naloin nor an increase to 60 mg aloin caused a laxative effect. Aloin was found in the faeces. The author \nalso studied the use of aloe as a laxative in 3 patients given 50 mg aloin in a gelatine capsule in the \nevening at 8 p.m. Test person A (female) fed upon vegetable and animal products, test person E  \n(female) predominantly fed upon fish and meat and test person H (male) was a vegetarian. Test \nperson A experienced soft stools once at day 1 and 2 and normal stools at day 3. Test person E \nexperienced soft stools at day 1 for four times. Test person H experienced soft stools once at day 1, 2 \nand 3. These different results corresponded to the cleavage of aloin and appearance of aloe- emodin in \nthe faeces. Test person E consumed an oral ferric product additionally. This product seemed to support \nthe cleavage of aloin. This was confirmed when test person A received a ferric product to o. The author \nconcluded that the laxative effect depends on the cleavage of aloin in aloe -emodin.  \nOdes et al. (1991) evaluated the effect of a laxative preparation, composed of celandine, Aloe vera  and \npsyllium in patients with chronic constipation i.e. requiring laxative treatment for at least 2 years. The aloe preparation in this combination  product derived from the leaves of Socotrine Aloes and also \ncontained barbaloin and other anthraquinone derivatives. Capsules of 500 mg were made up to contain the active ingredients celandine, A loe vera  and psyllium in the ratio 6:3:1. Thirty five men and women \nwere randomised to receive capsules containing celandine- Aloe vera -psyllium, or placebo, in a double -\nblind trial including a 14 -day basal period and a 28 -day treatment period. Twenty one of these had \nsimple constipation, and the others suffer ed from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. Organic \ncauses for constipation were excluded. Nineteen patients on celandine- Aloe vera -psyllium and 13 on \nplacebo successfully completed the study. The initial dose was 1 capsule per day, taken with wate r at \nbedtime, and increasing to 3 capsules per day depending on the response. The patients kept a daily diary card during the basal and treatment periods and recorded: date, number of capsules taken, \nnumber of bowel actions, stool consistency, abdominal pa in and distension, heartburn, other \nmedications and fibre supplements taken to relieve constipation, medicinal products taken for other \nconditions, and fluid intake. Symptoms of the last 2 weeks of the treatment period were compared to \nthose in the 14 -day basal period. Patients on celandine -Aloe vera -psyllium took 10.1 +/ - 4.1 capsules \nper week and patients on placebo 15.8 +/ - 6.9 capsules (p=0.02). The mean number of bowel actions \nper week in patients on celandine- Aloe vera -psyllium increased from 4.6 +/ - 2.4 to 7.9 +/ - 3.9 \n(p<0.002) and in the placebo group from 3.9 +/ - 1.6 to 4.3 +/ - 2.1 (p- value not mentioned). The \nstool consistency score decreased significantly in the verum group (p<0.002), while the placebo group \ndemonstrated no changes. Subjects on ce landine -Aloe vera -psyllium group had a higher basal pain \nscore than those receiving placebo (p<0.005), and there was no statistically significant improvement in either this or the placebo group during the trial. Overall, 16 of 19 patients on celandine -Aloe vera-\npsyllium regarded themselves as improved as compared with only 4 of the 13 patients on placebo (p<0.05). No subjects developed any side- effects from the treatment.  \nAssessor\u2019s Comment:  \nThis investigation of a combination product of three herbal substances cannot establish the \ncontribution of aloe to the observed effects. Furthermore, the herbal substance is \u201cSocotrine Aloes\u201d, which does not correspond to barbados aloes and cape aloes described in this assessment report and  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 38/56 \n derives from a different species. This species however contains also barbaloin and other anthraquinone \nderivatives ( Blaschek et al.,  2003).  \nKopp (1979)  tested in an open study Chol -Kugeletten\u00ae for 10 days in a combined treatment of a total \nof 18 cholecystectomised patients or patients with gallstones, in comparison with a placebo (physiological saline solution) as to its choleretic properties and tolerability. Chol- Kugeletten\u00ae contains \namongst others 25 mg aloe extract, 7 mg celandine extract, 5 mg curcuma root extract, 30 mg Fel Tauri depurat. sicc. (ox bile), 2.5 mg bisacodyl and 2.5 mg peppermint oil. Twelve patients received \nChol-Kugeletten\u00ae and 6 patients placebo. Three patients of the verum group were excluded because \nof incomplete data. Before the therapy begun, and after 5 and 10 days of oral administration of one tablet three times a day, the secretion capacity of the individual patients was measured by means of \nan intraduodenal tube by Bartelheimer\u2019s method. At these dates the secretion capacity was measured \nbefore and hourly after intraduodenal application of 3.33 ml Chol- Kugeletten\u00ae suspension \n(corresponding to 1 Chol- Kugeletten\u00ae tablet) or placebo for five times. The choleresis could be raised \nsignificantly for hours. No further increase of the quantity of the secretion was obtained after 5 or 10 \ndays of administration. The author concluded that there is a complete development of the action of the \npreparation that sets in immediately. Both the systemic and the local tolerability of Chol- Kugeletten\u00ae \nwere good; the upper abdomen symptoms could be alleviated in both groups, but more with Chol-Kugeletten\u00ae. No details are given in the publication.  \nAssessor\u2019s Comment:  \nThis investigation of a combination product of several agents cannot exactly show the contribution of \naloe to the observed effects.  \nSiegers et al.( 1993) reported about a retrospective study of 3,049 patients, who underwent diagnostic \ncolorectal endoscopy. The incidence of pseudomelanosis coli was 3.13% in patients without \npathological changes. In those with  colorectal adenomas, the incidence increased to 8.64% (p<0.01), \nand in those with colorectal carcinomas it was 3.29%. This lower rate was probably caused by \nincomplete documentation of pseudomelanosis coli in those with carcinoma. In a prospective study of \n1,095 pat ients, the incidence of pseudomelanosis coli was 6.9% for patients with no abnormality seen \non endoscopy, 9.8% (p=0.068) for patients with adenomas and 18.6% for patients with colorectal \ncarcinomas. From these data a relative risk of 3.04 (1.18, 4.9; 95% c onfidence interval) can be \ncalculated for colorectal cancer as a result of chronic anthranoid laxative abuse.  \nKune et al. (1988)  and Kune ( 1993)  reported about the \u201cMelbourne Colorectal Cancer Study\u201d. \nCommercial laxative use as a risk factor in colorectal  cancer was investigated as one part of this large \npopulation based epidemiological study of colorectal incidence, aetiology and survival. Commercial \nlaxative use was similar in 685 colorectal cancer patients and 723 age/sex matched European Union \nbased co ntrols. Also, when laxatives were subdivided into various groups containing anthraquinones, \nphenolphthalein, mineral salts and others, previous laxative intake was similar between cases and \ncontrols. Previous use of anthraquinone laxatives and of phenolphthalein containing laxatives was not \nassociated with the risk of colorectal cancer. Furthermore the results of this study suggest that chronic constipation, diarrhoea, and the frequency and consistency of bowel motions are unlikely to be \netiologic factors in the development of colorectal cancer. They indicate that it is the diet and not the \nconstipation that is associated with the risk of large -bowel cancer. Additionally, a highly statistically \nsignificant association (p=0.02) with the risk of colorectal can cer was found in those who reported \nconstipation and also had a high fat intake.  \nIn a retrospective study a cohort of 2,277 patients was defined by colonoscopy. Among other factors Nusko et al. (1993) tested whether in these patients laxative use or the en doscopically diagnosed  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii su ccus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 39/56 \n presence of melanosis coli were risk factors related to colorectal neoplasm. In comparison to patients \ntaking no laxatives there was no significant increase in colorectal cancer rate either in laxatives users \nor in patients with mela nosis coli. However, there was a statistically significant association between the \noccurrence of colorectal adenomas and laxative use (relative risk of all patients exposed to laxatives = \n1.72; of patients exposed to laxatives without melanosis coli = 1.47 ). The relative risk of adenoma \ndevelopment in patients with melanosis coli was 2.19. Taking into account that polyps can be \ndiagnosed in the dark mucosa of melanosis coli patients more easily, the authors concluded that even \nthis relative risk of 2.19 see ms to be related to a generally enhanced risk of laxative intake rather than \nto a special group of (anthranoid -containing) laxatives.  \nSonnenberg et al. (1993) performed a meta -analysis, since individual case control studies failed to \nresolve the question w hether constipation and use of cathartics (purgatives) represent significant risk \nfactors of colorectal cancer. The analysis of 14 previously published (from 1954 to 1988) case control \nstudies revealed statistically significant risks for colorectal cancer associated with both constipation and \nuse of cathartics, the pooled odds ratios (OR) and their 95 percent confidence intervals being 1.48 \n(1.32- 1.66) and 1.46 (1.33 -1.61), respectively. The increased risk applied similarly to both sexes, it \nwas higher in c ancer of the colon than rectum. Since constipation and cathartics are associated with \nmuch lower odds ratios than various dietary components, such as fat, meat, alcohol, and low -\nvegetable or low -residue diets, the authors concluded that their risk reflects  the confounding influence \nof underlying dietary habits.  \nLoew et al. (1994) conducted a comparative study involving 423 patients with colorectal neoplasms \nand 522 patients with benign proctologic disorders who were regular users of laxatives for bowel regulation. A pseudo melanosis  coli (PMC) test was used as an indicator of exposure to anthranoid -\ncontaining laxatives to determine if these preparations were potential colorectal carcinogenics. Results \nindicated no significant difference of the PMC rates betw een carcinoma (6.1%) and the control groups \n(4.2%) (p \u22640.197).  \nJacobs and White (1998) examined the associations of colon cancer with constipation and use of \ncommercial laxatives in a case -control study among men and women aged 30 \u2013  62 years (424 incident \ncases and 414 random -digital- dial controls). Constipation was defined by \u201cfeeling constipated to the \npoint of having to take something \u201d. The adjusted relative risk (RR) was 2.0 [95% confidence interval \n(CI) = 1.2 -3.6] for constipation 12 -51 times per year, and 4.4 (95%CI = 2.1- 8.9) for constipation 52 \nor more times a year. Cumulative lifetime use of commercial laxatives was also associated with \nincreased risk of colon cancer. When adjusted for constipation, commercial laxative use was no longer \nassociated wi th increased risk (RR = 0.3, 95%CI = 0.1- 0.9 for less than 350 uses; RR = 0.9, 95% CI \n= 0.4 -2.3 for 350 or more uses). The association with constipation remained. In this study, no subject \nreported use of anthranoid- containing laxatives.  \nNusko  et al. (2000) performed a prospective case control study to investigate  the risk of anthranoid -\ncontaining laxative use for the development of colorectal adenomas or carcinomas. A total of 202 patients with newly diagnosed colorectal carcinomas, 114 patients with adenomatous polyp, and 238 \npatients (controls) with no colorectal neoplasm who had been referred for total colonoscopy were \nstudied. The use of anthranoid preparations was assessed by standardised interview, and \nendoscopically visible or microscopic melanosis c oli was studied by histopathological examination. \nThere was no statistically significant risk of anthranoid use for the development of colorectal adenomas \n(unadjusted odds ratio 1.0; 95% CI 0.5- 1.9) or carcinomas (unadjusted odds ratio 1.0; 95% CI 0.6 -\n1.8). Even after adjustment for the risk factors age, sex, and blood in the stools by logistic regression \nanalysis the odds ratio for adenomas was 0.84 (95% CI 0.4 -1.7) and for carcinomas 0.93 (95% CI \n0.5-1.7). Also, there were no differences between the patient and control groups for duration of intake.  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 40/56 \n Macroscopic and high grade microscopic melanosis coli were not significant risk factors for the \ndevelopment of adenomas or carcinomas.  \nWillems et al. (2003) described a case of melanosis coli, which occurred in  a 39 years old liver \ntransplant patient, who took an over -the-counter product containing aloe, rheum and frangula. The \ntypical brownish pigmentation of the colonic mucosa developed in a period of ten months. The \nanthranoid medication was stopped and follow -up colonoscopy one year later showed normal looking \nmucosa once more. However, in contrast to previous examinations, a sessile polypoid lesion was found \nin the transverse colon. Histology showed tubulovillous adenoma with extensive low -grade dysplasia. \nSince there had been preliminary reports suggesting a possible role of anthranoid- containing laxatives \nin the development of colorectal adenomas and cancer, the authors discouraged their use.  \nRoberts et al. (2003) conducted a population -based, case -control study with equal representation by \nwhite and black men and  women aged 40 \u2013  80 years. Constipation, defined as fewer than three \nreported bowel movements per week, was associated with a greater than two -fold risk of colon cancer \n(OR 2.36; 95% CI = 1.41- 3.93)  adjusted for age, race, sex, and relevant confounders. The OR for \nconstipation was slightly higher for distal than for proximal colon cancers. There was no association \nwith laxative use (OR 0.88; 95% CI = 0.69- 1.11). The authors did not explicitly mention  \nanthraquinone -containing laxatives. They mentioned the group \u201cstimulants, fibers, natural remedies, \nstool softeners, oils, osmotic agents, enemas, suppositories, and unknown\u201d. They mention in particular \nphenolphthalein and magnesium.  \nNilsson  et al. (2004)  examined the impact of constipation and laxative treatment on the blood levels of \nhomocysteine, folate and cobalamine in a population -based sample of aged people. Elevated plasma \nhomocysteine secondary to reduced supply of folate and cobalamine, might ind icate an increased risk \nof cancer, and cardiovascular and neurological diseases. The homocysteine level depends on the supply \nof folate and cobalamine, which constipation and/or laxative treatment might compromise. The study was based on biochemical tests in 341 females and 183 males aged 82 years and older. The \nconcentrations of homocysteine (plasma), folate, cobalamine and urea (serum) were measured in \nsubjects with and without ongoing treatment with laxative products. Values were adjusted for age, \ngender  and frailty, as well as for clinical diagnoses and medicinal product therapies known to affect \nhomocysteine levels. Homocysteine levels were increased and those of folate reduced in aged subjects \non laxatives. Homocysteine remained elevated after adjustin g for frailty and various neurological \ndisorders. There was no significant effect on homocysteine and folate in constipated subjects without laxatives.  \nJoo et al. (1998) investigated changes occurring on barium enema in patients ingesting stimulant \nlaxativ es. The study consisted of two parts. In part 1, a retrospective review of consecutive barium \nenemas performed on two groups of patients with chronic constipation (group 1, stimulant laxative use \n(n=29); group 2, no stimulant laxative use (n=26)) was prese nted to a radiologist who was blinded to \nthe patient group. A data sheet containing classic descriptions of cathartic colon (historic term for the anatomic alteration of the colon secondary to chronic stimulant laxative use) was completed for each \nstudy. C hronic stimulant laxative use was defined as stimulant laxative ingestion more than three \ntimes per week for 1 year or longer. To confirm the findings of the retrospective study, 18 consecutive \npatients, who were chronic stimulant laxative users , underwent  barium enema examination, and data \nsheets for cathartic colon were completed by another radiologist (part 2). Colonic redundancy (group \n1, 34.5%; group 2, 19.2%) and dilatation (group 1, 44.8%; group 2, 23.1%) were frequent radiographic findings in both p atient groups and were not significantly different in the two groups. Loss \nof haustral folds, however, was a common finding in group 1 (27.6%) but was not seen in group 2 (p<0.005). Loss of haustral markings occurred in 15 (40.5%) of the total stimulant la xative users in  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensi s Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 41/56 \n the two parts of the study and was seen in the left colon of 6 (40%) patients, in the right colon of 2 \n(13.3%) patients, in the transverse colon of 5 (33.3%) patients, and in the entire colon of 2 (13.3%) \npatients. Loss of haustra was seen in patients chronically ingesting bisacodyl, phenolphthalein, senna, and casanthranol. The authors concluded that long -term stimulant laxative use results in anatomic \nchanges in the colon characterised by loss of haustral folds, a finding that suggest neur onal injury or \ndamage to colonic longitudinal musculature caused by these agents.  \nAdd- on therapy of Aloe and different polychemotherapies in different metastatic \ntumor tumour  entities  \nA study was planned to include 240 patients with metastatic solid tumour  who were randomized to \nreceive chemotherapy with or without Aloe. According to tumour  histotype and clinical status, lung \ncancer patients were treated with cisplatin and etoposide or weekly vinorelbine, colorectal cancer patients received oxaliplatin plus 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), gastric cancer patients were treated with \nweekly 5 -FU and pancreatic cancer patients received weekly gemcitabine. Aloe arborescens  was given \norally at a dose of 10 ml thrice daily of a mixture consisting of 300 g of Aloe fresh leaves  in 500 g of \nhoney plus  40 ml of 40% alcohol (m/m or V/ V unknown), every day without interruption, either during \nor after chemotherapy, until the progression of disease, starting 6 days prior to the onset of \nchemotherapy. The clinical response and toxicity  were assessed according to WHO criteria. The clinical \nresponses were radiologically evaluated after at least three cycles of chemotherapy by repeating the \nsame radiological investigation used prior to the onset of chemotherapy, including CT scan, NMR and \nPET. The percentage of both objective tumour  regressions and disease control was significantly higher \nin patients concomitantly treated with Aloe than with chemotherapy alone, as well as the percent of 3  \nyears survival patients.

Its ability to lower the blood glucose was studied in 5 patients with non -insulin -\ndependent diabetes and in Swiss albino mice made diabetic using alloxan. During the ingestion of aloes \n(dried resin, HAD content unknown), half a teaspoonful daily for 4 -14 weeks, the fasting serum glucose \nlevel fell in every patient from a mean of 273 +/ - 25 (SE) to 151 +/ - 23 mg/dl (p less than 0.05) with \nno change in body weight.

Clinical studies in spec ial populations (e.g. elderly and children)  \nGenerally , a change of nutrition is recommended in constipated children via  an increase in daily fibre \nintake. According to the recommendations from a conference on dietary fibre in childhood, children \nolder than  2 years of age should increase their intake of dietary fibre (increased consumption of a \nvariety of fruits, vegetables, cereal and other grain product) to an amount equal or greater than their age plus 5 g (e.g. 8 g/day at age 3) (Williams  et al., 1994). Change in nutrition should be accompanied \nwith behaviour modification, e.g. increased physical exercise. There are no systematic clinical data available, which evaluate the use of aloe dried juice as a laxative in children.  \nAccording to the ESCOP and WHO m onographs, the use in children under 10 years of age cannot be \nrecommended.  \nAccording to the \u201cNote for guidance on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the paediatric population\u201d (CPMP/ICH/2711/99), the age limit between \u201cchildren\u201d and \u201cadolesc ents\u201d is set to \u201c12 \nyears of age\u201d.  \n4.4.  Overall conclusions on clinical pharmacology and efficacy  \nIn the absence of clinical studies, the laxative effect of barbados aloes and cape aloes is mainly based \non pharmacological data , clinical experiences  and class- effects comparable with other \nhydroxyanthracene derivatives containing herbal substances. Clinical and pharmacological data \nobtained on other anthranoid -containing laxatives (please refer to the assessment report on \u201cCassia \nsenna L. and Cassia angustifolia V ahl, folium\u201d) support the efficacy of these anthranoid -containing \nherbal substances for short -term use in cases of occasional constipation.  \nOther effects have been predominantly investigated in experimental studies. Adequate clinical trials are \nnot availab le. \nBecause of the possible genotoxic or tumorigenic  risk in experimental investigations and the results of \nSiegers (1993) , pharmacovigilance actions for anthranoid -containing laxatives were initiated in \nGermany in 1996: the daily dose and the duration of administration were limited and children, pregnant  women and nursing mothers were excluded from the application of aloe containing laxatives.  \nThe results of the most recent studies are inconsistent and the question of a possible carcinogenic risk \nof long -term use of anthranoid -containing laxatives is still open. Some studies revealed a risk for \ncolorectal cancer associated with the use of anthraquinone -containing laxatives, some studies did not. \nHowever, a risk was also revealed for constipation itself and  underlying dietary habits. Further \ninvestigations are needed to determine the carcinogenic risk definitely.  \nLong-term administration of anthranoid -containing medicinal products leads to the development over a \nperiod of 4 \u2013  13 months of pseudomelanosis coli \u2013 pigmentation of the gut wall in the caecum and \ncolon. This condition is produced by the accumulation of macrophages that have stored a brown \npigment from the breakdown products of anthranoid (probably lipofuscin) and consequently cause the \nmucosa to appear brown to blackish -brown in colour. Prevalence among patients with chronic \nconstipation is reported to be 12 \u2013  31%, and 62% following chronic ingestion of anthranoid -containing \nlaxatives. This finding disappears 6 \u2013  12 months after stopping chronic la xative administration.  \nLong-term stimulant laxative use may result in anatomic changes in the colon characterised by loss of \nhaustral folds.  These considerations also contribute to the limitation of the maximum duration of use.    \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on  Aloe (various species, mainly  Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatu   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 49/56 \n \n 5.  Clinical Safety/Pharmacovig ilance  \n5.1.  Overview of toxicological/safety data from clinical trials in humans  \nThe relationship between sigmoid cancer (SC) and constipation, anthranoid laxative  use, and melanosis \ncoli using ACF analysis (aberrant crypt foci analysis) was investigated. Fifty -five surgical patients with \nSC, 41 surgical patients with diverticular disease (DD), and 96 age-  and sex -matched subjects without \nintestinal disease (controls) were interviewed on their history of constipation and anthranoid laxative  \nuse. Melanosis coli a nd ACF characteristics were investigated on sigmoid mucosa in patients with SC or \nDD. Constipation and anthranoid laxative  use were similar between patients with SC (30.9% and \n32.7%, respectively) and those with DD (39% and 26.8%) but higher than among con trols (18.8% \nand 8.3%). Melanosis coli was found in 38.2% of patients with SC and in 39% of those with DD. Mean \nACF frequency was higher in patients with SC (0.24/cm(2)) than in those with DD (0.10/cm(2); P < \n0.0001), and it did not vary according to const ipation, laxative  use, or melanosis coli in either group. \nThis study confirms the association of ACF frequency with colon cancer and does not support the \nhypothesis of a cause -effect relationship of CRC with constipation, anthranoid laxative , use or \nmelano sis coli (Nascimbeni  et al., 2002) . \n  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on Aloe (various species, mainly Aloe ferox  Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus \nsiccatus    \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 50/56 \n \n Table 6 : Clinical safety data from clinical trials  \nType  \n Study   Test Product(s)  Number of  \nsubjects   Type of  subjects  Adverse reactions   Comments  \nNascimbeni  et \nal., 2002 prospective  Not specified  55 SC  \n41 DD  \n96 cont rols Fifty-five surgical \npatients with \nsigmoid cancer \n(SC), 41 surgical \npatients with \ndiverticular \ndisease (DD), and \n96 age-  and sex -\nmatched subjects \nwithout intestinal disease (controls) were interviewed \non their history of \nconstipation and anthranoid laxativ\ne use.

Patient exposure  \nNo data available.  The above cited studies do  not include specific data for consumption of Aloe extracts \nstandardized for their HAD content. The frequency of adverse reactions can therefore not be specified.  \n5.3.  Adverse events, serious adverse events and deaths  \nChronic use or abuse of aloe dried juice pr eparations may lead to hypokalaemia. This hypokalaemia \nand the increased loss of potassium may increase the activity of cardiac glycosides and interfere with \nthe action of anti- arrhythmic  agents (interaction with antiarrhythmic medicinal products, which in duce \nreversion to sinus rhythm, e.g. quinidine) and medicinal products inducing QT -prolongation \n(Haverkamp et al., 2002). Concomitant use with medicinal products inducing hypokalaemia (e.g. \ndiuretics, adrenocorticosteroids and liquorice root) may aggravate  electrolyte imbalance.  \nProlonged use of aloe containing preparations is associated with watery diarrhoea leading to electrolyte imbalance and the increased loss of potassium can lead to hypokalaemia (Cooke , 1981) . \nA case of a 47 year s old man from Soweto,  South Africa is reported, who developed acute oliguric \nrenal failure and liver dysfunction after ingestion of an herbal remedy. The patient's renal function recovered slowly, and dialysis was discontinued after several weeks, although serum creatinine did not \nreturn to the normal range. Mass spectrometric and chromatographic analysis of the herbal remedy \nused by the patient revealed the presence of Cape aloes (Luyckx et al. , 2002) . \nLee et al. (2004) described a patient with massive intraoperative bleeding after oral consumption of \nAloe vera  tablets. A 35 years old woman lost 5l of blood during surgery as a result of a possible \ninteraction between Aloe vera  and sevoflurane. The authors stated that compounds contained in Aloe \nvera can cause a reduction in  prostaglandin synthesis, which may inhibit secondary aggregation of \nplatelets. Sevoflurane inhibits thromboxane A2 formation by suppression of cyclooxygenase activity, \nimpairs platelet aggregation, and prolongs bleeding. Although the vascularity and size of the \nhaemangioma were the most important factors for the massive intraoperative blood loss, the authors \nconcluded that concomitant use of sevoflurane and Aloe vera  played a contributory role and that this \nadverse event was possible as a result of the sevoflu rane and Aloe vera  interaction.   \nAssessor \u2019s Comment:  \nThe information given in the publication is insufficient. The Aloe vera preparation may not be \ncomparable to the aloe preparations assessed in this report.  \nIncreased loss of potassium may potentiate th e actions of conventional drugs such as cardiac \nglycosides  and corticosteroids. Such interactions may result in cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension.  \n5.4.  Laboratory findings  \nNot applicable  \n5.5.  Safety in special populations and situations  \nThe importance of hydration and electrolyte replacement has been recognized in the management of \npatients with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) (Kitabchi et al.  2001, Waldh\u00e4usl et al.  \n1979). Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) is recommended at 15\u2013 20 ml/kg during the first 1\u2013 2 h, followed by \n250\u2013500 m l/h until resolution of  the hyperglycemic crisis. Fluid replacement alone has been shown to \nreduce glucose concentration by 75\u2013 100 mg/h, due to a reduction in counter regulatory  hormones and  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on Aloe (various species, mainly Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatu s   \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 52/56 \n improvement of renal perfusion (Matz , 1999).  In addition, many patients with HHS have high serum \npotassium despite total body potassium deficit due to insulin deficiency and hyperosmolality, which \ncause a shift of potassium from the intracellular compartment into plasma (Cruz -Caudillo and Sabatini , \n1995, Ennis et al. , 1994). During insulin treatment and hydration, serum potassium levels rapidly fall; \ntherefore, it is recommended that potassium replacement should be initiated when serum levels fall <5.5 mEq/ l, with the goal to maintain a serum potassium concentration in the range of 4 \u20135 mEq/ l \n(Pasquel and Umpierrez , 2014).  \nThe basics of treatment of a diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) are intravenous fluid replacement with large \nvolumina  and the intravenous substitution with insulin as well. An additional r eplacement of high \namounts of potassium is critical, because the efficacy of the insulin shifts the potassium from the \nextracellular volume into the cells. From the hyperkalemia a hypokalemia is developing. With \nunderlying  potassium depletion from chronic laxative abuse a higher intravenous potassium \nsupplement is essential (Gosmanov et al. , 2014).  \n5.5.1.  Use in children and adolescents  \nChildren should not use hydroxyanthracene containing products to treat constipation. Diet changes  and \nphysical exercise should b e used to change bowel habits.  \n5.5.2.  Contraindications  \nAloe preparations should not be used by patients with known hypersensitivity to aloe.  \nThere are several publications available dealing with allergic reactions. Most of all these reactions were \ncaused by local application and the aloe preparations used are not exactly specified. Ernst (2000)  \nreported that remedies which can cause dermatological side -effects include \u201c Aloe vera \u201d besides others. \nAnliker et al. (2002) described a case of an anaphylactic shock due  to local application of \u201c Aloe vera  \nleaves\u201d.  Schempp et al. (2002) categorised \u201caloe\u201d as sensitising plant in cosmetics.  \nFurthermore, like all anthranoid -containing laxatives, aloe -containing medicinal products should not be \nused in cases of intestinal obs tructions and stenosis, atony, appendicitis, inflammatory colon diseases \n(e.g. Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis), abdominal pain of unknown origin, severe dehydration states \nwith water and electrolyte depletion.  \n5.5.3.  Special warnings and precautions for use  \nThe following warnings and precautions for use are recommended:  \n\u2022 Long-term use of stimulant laxatives should be avoided, as use for more than a brief period of \ntreatment may lead to impaired function of the intestine and dependence on laxatives. If laxativ es \nare needed every day the cause of the constipation should be investigated. Senna pod \npreparations should only be used if a therapeutic effect cannot be achieved by a change of diet or \nthe administration of bulk forming agents.  \n\u2022 Patients taking cardiac gl ycosides, antiarrhythmic medicinal products, medicinal products inducing \nQT-prolongation, diuretics, adrenocorticosteroids or liquorice root, have to consult a doctor before \ntaking aloes concomitantly.  \n\u2022 Like all laxatives, aloes should not be taken by patie nts suffering from faecal impaction and \nundiagnosed, acute or persistent gastro -intestinal complaints, e.g. abdominal pain, nausea and  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on Aloe (various species, mainly Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus    \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 53/56 \n vomiting unless advised by a doctor because these symptoms can be signs of potential or existing \nintestinal blockage (ile us). \n\u2022 Patients with kidney disorders should be aware of possible electrolyte imbalance.  \n\u2022 If the symptoms worsen during the use of the medicinal product, a doctor or a pharmacist should \nbe consulted.  \n\u2022 For liquid dosage forms containing ethanol the appropriate labelling for ethanol, taken from the \n\u2018Guideline on excipients in the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use\u2019, must be included.  \nIt cannot be definitely assessed if a longer than a brief period of treatment with stimulant laxatives \nleads to dependence requiring increasing quantities of the medicinal product, to an atonic colon with \nimpaired function and to aggravation of the constipation.  \nM\u00fcller -Lissner (2005) concluded in his review that the arguments in favour of laxative -induced da mage \nto the autonomous nervous system of the colon are based on poorly documented experiments and that, in contrast, the investigations that do not support such damage are well done. The studies in the cited references (Smith 1968; Riemann et al.  1980 and 1982; Berkelhammer et al. , 2002; Meisel et \nal., 1977; Pockros and Foroozan , 1985) showed abnormalities observed in humans (damage to enteric \nnerves, smooth muscle atrophy; distension or ballooning of axons, reduction of nerve -specific cell \nstructures and i ncrease in lysosomes, and sometimes a total degeneration of whole nerve fibres ; short -\nlived superficial damage to the mucosa). They were uncontrolled observations and the author therefore concluded that the cause of these damages can also be the constipati on itself or pre -existing changes \nof unknown aetiology.  \nThe only study comparing the morphology of the autonomous nervous system of constipated patients \ntaking anthraquinones ( Aloe) to that of an appropriate control group of constipated patients without \nlaxative intake (Riecken et al. , 1990) did not support the hypothesis that anthraquinone -containing \nlaxatives are able to provoke relevant degenerative changes in the colonic nerve tissue. But this \ninvestigation was conducted  in 11 matched pairs only.  \n5.5.4.  Drug i nteractions and other forms of interaction \nThe available data on pharmacokinetic interactions do not reveal any specific pharmacokinetic interaction. Interaction s associated with  potassium metabolism are addressed in the monograph in the \nsection \u201cInteracti ons\u201d. \nHypokalaemia (resulting from long -term laxative abuse) potentiates the action of cardiac glycosides \nand interacts with antiarrhythmic medicinal products. Concomitant use with diuretics, adrenal \ncorticosteroids and liquorice root may enhance loss of p otassium.  \n5.5.5.  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  \nSafety during pregnancy and lactation has not been established. In the absence of sufficient data  and \nbecause of concerns  on genotoxic and cancerogenic potential, the use during pregnancy and lactation \nis contra indicated .  \n5.5.6.  Overdose  \nLike for all anthranoid -containing laxatives, the major symptoms of overdose/abuse are griping pain \nand severe diarrhoea with consequent losses of fluid and electrolyte, which should be replaced.  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on Aloe (various species, mainly Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus    \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 54/56 \n Diarrhoea may cause potassium depletion , in particular. Potassium depletion may lead to cardiac \ndisorders and muscular asthenia, particularly where cardiac glycosides, diuretics or \nadrenocorticosteroids are being taken at the same time.  \nTreatment should be supportive with generous amounts of fluid. Electrolytes, especially potassium, should be monitored. This is especially important in the elderly.  \nFurthermore chronic ingestion of overdoses of anthranoid -containing medicinal products may lead to \ntoxic hepatitis (see below).  \nHepatitis  \nBeuers et al. (1991) reported a case of toxic hepatitis related to abuse of senna glycosides in a 26 \nyears old female, who had taken an extract of senna fruits corresponding to 100 mg of sennoside B \ndaily in addition to the usual dose of 10 g senna leaves twice a wee k in a laxative tea. When the \npatient stopped taking senna, aminotransferases fell by 70% within a week and ranged from 20 \u2013  40 \nU/l subsequently. When the patient took senna alkaloids again, 2 months later, liver function rapidly deteriorated and improved once more when the product was stopped.  \nVanderperren et al. (2005)  reported a case of a 52  years old woman, who had ingested, for more than \n3 years, one litre of an herbal tea each day made from a bag containing 70 g of dry senna fruits. She \ndeveloped rena l impairment and acute hepatic failure with increase in prothrombin time (international \nnormalised ratio > 7) and development of encephalopathy. The patient recovered with supportive \ntherapy. Surprisingly , large amounts of cadmium were transiently recovere d in the urine.  \nAccording to the Rucam score (Roussel UCLAF causality assessment method -  for detailed information, \nplease see the assessment report on \u201cCassia senna L. and Cassia angustifolia Vahl, folium\u201d), these \nhepatoxic cases are related to the chron ic ingestion of overdoses. Concentrated and dried juice of the \nleaves of Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and Aloe (various species, mainly Aloe ferox  Mill. and its hybrids) being \nanthranoid -containing herbal substances, the possibility of toxic hepatic reactions is  referred to in the \nsection \u2018Overdose\u2019 of the European Union herbal monograph on aloe.  \n5.5.7.  Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of \nmental ability  \nNot applicable  \n5.5.8.  Safety in other special situations  \nLike all anthranoid -containing laxativ es, aloe preparations may produce abdominal pain and colicky  \ngastrointestinal symptoms and passage of liquid stools, in particular in patients with irritable colon. \nHowever, these symptoms may also occur generally as a consequence of individual over dosage. In \nsuch cases dose reduction  is necessary. The correct individual dose is the smallest required to produce \na comfortable soft -formed motion . \nAs mentioned above hypersensitive reactions may occur.  \nChronic use may lead to disorders in water equilibrium and  electrolyte metabolism, and may result in \nalbuminuria and haematuria.  \nFurthermore, use over a long period may lead to pigmentation of the intestinal mucosa (pseudomelanosis coli), which usually recedes when the patient stops taking the preparation (see \nsection 4.4).  \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on Aloe (various species, mainly Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus    \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 55/56 \n Yellow or red -brown (pH dependent) discolouration of urine by metabolit es, which is not clinically \nsignificant, may occur during the treatment (see section 4.1.2).  \nLuyckx et al. reported 2002 a case of a 47 y ears old man from Soweto, South Africa, who developed \nacute oliguric renal failure and liver dysfunction after ingestion of an herbal remedy. The patient\u2019s renal \nfunction recovered slowly, and dialysis was discontinued after several weeks, although serum \ncreatinine did not return to the norm al range. Mass spectrometric and chromatographic analysis of the \nherbal remedy used by the patient revealed the presence of \u201cCape aloes\u201d.  \nThe causality cannot be assessed definitely.  \nThe German Health Authority has received one report of an adverse event concerning a mono -\npreparation (a Mexican aloe extract). A 45  years old patient, who regularly takes levothyroxine, \ndeveloped glycosuria , albuminuria, haematuria, and leucocyturia after taking the aloe extract. This \npatient was suspected to have a toxic- interstitial nephritis and nutritive -toxic tubular injury. One week \nafter dechallenge the urinary findings improved. The aloe extract was suspected to cause these \nadverse events. The extract was not specified. Therefore an assessment whether the extract is \ncomparable with the preparations described in this assessment report or not is not possible. \nNevertheless albuminuria and haematuria are known adverse reactions of chronic misuse of aloe preparations.  \n5.6.  Overall conclusions on clinical safety  \nThe above mentioned safety concern s are balanced by an adequate benefit in treating short term \nconstipation.  \n6.  Overall conclusions (benefit -risk assessment)  \nWell-established use  \nShort term use of occasional constipation . \nThere are no clinical studies available, which evaluate  the clinical efficacy of barbados aloes and cape \naloes in patients with occasional constipation.  Well-designed studies with mono -preparations of A loe \nvera containing laxatives are missing. There are herbal medicinal products with herbal preparations of \nAloe, folii succus siccatus  on the  market, which fulfil the criteria of a marketing authorization for the \nperiod of ten years.  \nThe postulated laxative effect is mainly based on pharmacological data, c linical experiences  and \nanalogy to class- effects of other hydroxyanthracene derivatives . Clinical and pharmacological data \nobtained on other anthranoid -containing laxatives (primarily senna leaf preparations) support the \nefficacy of these anthranoid -containing herbal substances for short -term use in cases of occasional \nconstipation.  \nThe use in children under 12 years of age, during pregnancy and lactation is contraindicated.  \nDue to the particulars of hydroxyanthracene derivatives adequate precautions and special warnings are \nnecessary. With respect to misuse for l onger periods and especially because of some remaining \nconcerns on carcinogenicity the duration of use is limited to a maximum use of one week.  \nThe hydroxyanthracene containing plant extracts are standardised extracts according to their \nhydroxynthracene co ntent.  \nATC-Code: A06AB   \n \nAssessment report on Aloe barbadensis  Mill. and on Aloe (various species, mainly Aloe \nferox Mill. and its hybrids), folii succus siccatus    \nEMA/HMPC/759585/2015   Page 56/56 \n Traditional use  \nBesides the use as a laxative, the use as an em menagogue and the external use for wounds and \nabscess are described in most references mentioned above. But as already mentioned in the \nDispensatory of the United States of America 1918, it is extremely doubtful whether aloe exercises any action upon the pelvic organs which is not attributable to its cathartic effects. There are no plausible \npharmacological data for this indication, nor for haemoptysis, jaundice or gout etc. Furthermore, the \npreparations used are not described sufficiently.  For external use there are no defined preparations.  \nA monograph on traditional use is not established as the above mentioned references are not sufficient \nto prove that the respective pr oducts are not harmful in the specified conditions of use and that the \npharmacological effects or efficacy of the medicinal product are plausible. \n \nAnnex  \nList of references  ", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
