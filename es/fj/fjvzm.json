Revisions and selected studies were subjected to critical reading and assessment of methodological quality.\nResults: Pharmacist advice is often requested on the use of these agents for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2); however, this is an area that has insufficient evidence to support confident recommendations. Many published studies involving herbal agents are small and poorly designed, with heterogeneous results.\nConclusion: The strongest scientific evidence for blood glucose lowering effect is associated with fenugreek. There is also good evidence supporting the use of ivy gourd and gymnema for management of hyperglycemia.\nKey Words: Herbal supplements, diabetes, dietary supplements and botanicals.\n____\nDownload PDF:\n[Plantas medicinales en el tratamiento de la diabetes mellitus tipo 2](https://www.ilaphar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Plantas-medicinales-en-el-tratamiento-de-la-diabetes-mellitus-tipo-2.pdf)\nArticle in number:\n[VOL. 26 \u2013 N\u00ba1 \u2013 2016](https://www.ilaphar.org/en/vol-26-no1-2016/)", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": "article", "links": ["#genesis-nav-primary", "#genesis-content", "#genesis-footer-widgets", "https://www.ilaphar.org/en/", "https://www.ilaphar.org/numeros-revista/", "https://www.ilaphar.org/sobre-la-revista/", "https://www.ilaphar.org/eventos-ilaphar/", "https://www.ilaphar.org/en/medicinal-herbs-in-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-a-review/", "https://www.ilaphar.org/plantas-medicinales-en-el-tratamiento-de-la-diabetes-mellitus-tipo-2-una-revision/", "https://www.ilaphar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Plantas-medicinales-en-el-tratamiento-de-la-diabetes-mellitus-tipo-2.pdf", "https://www.ilaphar.org/en/vol-26-no1-2016/", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://www.facebook.com/RevistadelaOFIL/", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/5380755?trk=prof-exp-company-name", "https://twitter.com/revistadelaofil", "http://inigosoler.com/sobre-mi/", "https://www.ilaphar.org/politica-de-cookies/", "http://wordpress.org/plugins/asesor-cookies-para-la-ley-en-espana/", "javascript:;", null]}
