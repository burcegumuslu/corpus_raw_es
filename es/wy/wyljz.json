For this, its principal sections are Originals, Clinical Notes, Images of Interest, and Special Collaboration articles. The works may be submitted in Spanish or English and are subjected to a peer review process.\nIn 2009, it became the leading Spanish journal in the field of Medical Imaging on having an Impact Factor, awarded by the Journal Citation Reports. The Journal is included in Science Citation Index Expanded, Medline, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, Scopus and IBECS.\nFORMAL FEATURES OF THE TEXT\nAbbreviations: Only standard abbreviations in the field of Nuclear Medicine should be used. The first time they appear in the text they should be preceded by the complete term to which they refer, except for the most common ones (e.g. SPECT, PET, PET/TC), when this description may be omitted.\nRadiopharmaceuticals: In the expression of radiopharmaceuticals, the radionuclide will be positioned first, beginning with its atomic mass in superscript and linked by a dash to the non radioactive ligand (e.g. : 99mTc-HMPAO, 123I-MIBG). The units of activity to be used will be those of the International System (MBq) with the equivalence in units of the traditional system being expressed, in brackets, if desired (mCi).\nTechniques: When expressing the techniques the radiopharmaceutical includes, the radiopharmaceutical will first be indicated, followed by a blank space and then the technique (e.g. 99mTc-DMSA SPECT/TC, 18F-FDG PET/TC).\nLanguage: The journal publishes all of its articles in Spanish and English. For the \u00abInteresting images\u00bb received in Spanish, the author must send a version in English once the article has been accepted. When articles from Spanish authors are received in English, once they have been accepted, the author shall be consulted as to whether they prefer to translate the text into Spanish themselves or send it to a translator, the costs of which would be met by REMNIM.\nOriginal articles. The manuscript should have the following order:Title, structured Resumen/Abstract (objective, material and methods, results, conclusions) with a maximum of 250 words, Palabras clave/ Keywords (3 to 6), Introduction, Material and M\u00e9todos, Results, Discussion, Conclusions and References. Original articles should have a maximum length of 6,500 words (18 DIN-A4) and up to 5 tables and 5 figures will be accepted. Do not exceed 30 references.\nImages of interest. Briefly describe the findings of the examination/image(s) and their relevance in a clinical case). The figure captions should provide a more detailed explanation of the case, examinations and findings. The total length of the text should not exceed 500 words. A maximum number of 6 authors is recommended. Up to 3 figures and references will be accepted.\nLetters to the Editor. Maximum length should be 600 words (2 DIN A-4). One figure and one table will be accepted. There should be no more than 5 references. A maximum of 6 authors is recommended.\nOther sections. The journal includes other sections which will be commissioned as:\n\u00bf Continuing Education. The manuscript should have the following structure: Title, non-structured abstract with a maximum of 150 words, Keywords (3 to 6) and the following sections: 1) Introduction that would include the approach to the issue, the current status of the issue; 2) Practical application/implementation: indications, methodology, interpretation, clinical impact; 3). References: do not exceed from 40; 4) Key points; 5) 8-10 multiple-choice questions with 5 answers and only one valid answer. Maximum length of the text should be 6,500 words (18 DIN-A4) and up to 5 tables and 5 figures will be accepted. Depending on the subject to be developed, some of the points may not be applicable.\n\u00bf Special Collaboration. These are articles whose main objective is the maintenance or improvement of knowledge, so that Nuclear Medicine professionals can receive updated training in the most relevant topics of their professional practice. The Special Collaboration, unlike continuing education, which has more of a teaching objective, reflects more the author's personal experience and opinion. Just to serve as a guide the manuscript should include an abstract, 3-5 keywords. Maximum length of the text should be 6,500 words (18 DIN-A4) and up to 5 tables and 5 figures will be accepted. A maximum of 40 references are recommended.\nYou can send your manuscript at\n[www.e](http://www.evise.com/evise/jrnl/ddmec) [vise.com/evise/jrnl/REMNIM](http://www.evise.com/evise/jrnl/ddmec)\nThis journal is published in Spanish and in English language.\nYou can use this list to carry out a final check of your submission before you send it to the journal for review.

The manuscript should be in line with the [Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations) and aim for the inclusion of representative human populations (sex, age and ethnicity) as per those recommendations. The terms [sex and gender](https://www.who.int/gender-equity-rights/understanding/gender-definition/en/) should be used correctly.\nAuthors should include a statement in the manuscript that informed consent was obtained for experimentation with human subjects. The privacy rights of human subjects must always be observed.\nAll animal experiments should comply with the\n[ARRIVE guidelines](https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines) and should be carried out in accordance with the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and associated guidelines, [EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/legislation_en.htm), or the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of Laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978) and the authors should clearly indicate in the manuscript that such guidelines have been followed. The sex of animals must be indicated, and where appropriate, the influence (or association) of sex on the results of the study.\nStudies on patients or volunteers require ethics committee approval and informed consent, which should be documented in the paper. Appropriate consents, permissions and releases must be obtained where an author wishes to include case details or other personal information or images of patients and any other individuals in an Elsevier publication. Written consents must be retained by the author but copies should not be provided to the journal. Only if specifically requested by the journal in exceptional circumstances (for example if a legal issue arises) the author must provide copies of the consents or evidence that such consents have been obtained. For more information, please review the\n[Elsevier Policy on the Use of Images or Personal Information of Patients or other Individuals](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/patient-consent). Unless you have written permission from the patient (or, where applicable, the next of kin), the personal details of any patient included in any part of the article and in any supplementary materials (including all illustrations and videos) must be removed before submission.\nAll authors must disclose any financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence (bias) their work. Examples of potential competing interests include employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony, patent applications/registrations, and grants or other funding. Authors must disclose any interests in two places: 1. A summary declaration of interest statement in the title page file (if double-blind) or the manuscript file (if single-blind). If there are no interests to declare then please state this: 'Declarations of interest: none'. This summary statement will be ultimately published if the article is accepted. 2. Detailed disclosures as part of a separate Declaration of Interest form, which forms part of the journal's official records. It is important for potential interests to be declared in both places and that the information matches.\n[More information](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/286/supporthub/publishing).\nThe below guidance only refers to the writing process, and not to the use of AI tools to analyse and draw insights from data as part of the research process.\nWhere authors use generative artificial intelligence (AI) and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process, authors should only use these technologies to improve readability and language. Applying the technology should be done with human oversight and control, and authors should carefully review and edit the result, as AI can generate authoritative-sounding output that can be incorrect, incomplete or biased. AI and AI-assisted technologies should not be listed as an author or co-author, or be cited as an author. Authorship implies responsibilities and tasks that can only be attributed to and performed by humans, as outlined in Elsevier\u2019s\n[AI policy for authors](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/publishing-ethics#Authors).\nAuthors should disclose in their manuscript the use of AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process by following the instructions below. A statement will appear in the published work. Please note that authors are ultimately responsible and accountable for the contents of the work.\nDisclosure instructions\nAuthors must disclose the use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process by adding a statement at the end of their manuscript in the core manuscript file, before the References list. The statement should be placed in a new section entitled \u2018Declaration of Generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process\u2019.\nStatement: During the preparation of this work the author(s) used [NAME TOOL / SERVICE] in order to [REASON]. After using this tool/service, the author(s) reviewed and edited the content as needed and take(s) full responsibility for the content of the publication.\nThis declaration does not apply to the use of basic tools for checking grammar, spelling, references etc. If there is nothing to disclose, there is no need to add a statement.\nSubmission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis, see '\n[Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication](http://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/policies-and-ethics)' section of our ethics policy for more information), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, including electronically without the written consent of the copyright-holder. To verify originality, your article may be checked by the originality detection service [Crossref Similarity Check](https://www.elsevier.com/editors/perk/plagiarism-complaints/plagiarism-detection).\nPlease note that\n[preprints](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/sharing/preprint) can be shared anywhere at any time, in line with Elsevier's [sharing policy](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/sharing). Sharing your preprints e.g. on a preprint server will not count as prior publication (see ' [Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/policies-and-ethics)' for more information).\nInclusive language acknowledges diversity, conveys respect to all people, is sensitive to differences, and promotes equal opportunities. Content should make no assumptions about the beliefs or commitments of any reader; contain nothing which might imply that one individual is superior to another on the grounds of age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability or health condition; and use inclusive language throughout. Authors should ensure that writing is free from stereotypes, slang, reference to dominant culture and/or cultural assumptions. We advise to seek gender neutrality by using plural nouns (\"clinicians, patients/clients\") as default/wherever possible to avoid using \"he, she,\" or \"he/she.\" We recommend avoiding the use of descriptors that refer to personal attributes such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability or health condition unless they are relevant and valid. These guidelines are meant as a point of reference to help identify appropriate language but are by no means exhaustive or definitive.\nReporting guidance\nFor research involving or pertaining to humans, animals or eukaryotic cells, investigators should integrate sex and gender-based analyses (SGBA) into their research design according to funder/sponsor requirements and best practices within a field. Authors should address the sex and/or gender dimensions of their research in their article. In cases where they cannot, they should discuss this as a limitation to their research's generalizability. Importantly, authors should explicitly state what definitions of sex and/or gender they are applying to enhance the precision, rigor and reproducibility of their research and to avoid ambiguity or conflation of terms and the constructs to which they refer (see Definitions section below). Authors can refer to the\n[SSex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-016-0007-6) and the [S SAGER guidelines checklist](https://doi.org/10.3897/ese.2022.e86910). These offer systematic approaches to the use and editorial review of sex and gender information in study design, data analysis, outcome reporting and research interpretation - however, please note there is no single, universally agreed-upon set of guidelines for defining sex and gender.\nDefinitions\nSex generally refers to a set of biological attributes that are associated with physical and physiological features (e.g., chromosomal genotype, hormonal levels, internal and external anatomy). A binary sex categorization (male/female) is usually designated at birth (\"sex assigned at birth\"), most often based solely on the visible external anatomy of a newborn. Gender generally refers to socially constructed roles, behaviors, and identities of women, men and gender-diverse people that occur in a historical and cultural context and may vary across societies and over time. Gender influences how people view themselves and each other, how they behave and interact and how power is distributed in society. Sex and gender are often incorrectly portrayed as binary (female/male or woman/man) and unchanging whereas these constructs actually exist along a spectrum and include additional sex categorizations and gender identities such as people who are intersex/have differences of sex development (DSD) or identify as non-binary. Moreover, the terms \"sex\" and \"gender\" can be ambiguous\u2014thus it is important for authors to define the manner in which they are used. In addition to this definition guidance and the SAGER guidelines, the\n[Sresources on this page](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/edi#SAGER) offer further insight around sex and gender in research studies.\nAll authors should have made substantial contributions to all of the following: (1) the conception and design of the study, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data, (2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, (3) final approval of the version to be submitted.\nAuthors are expected to consider carefully the list and order of authors before submitting their manuscript and provide the definitive list of authors at the time of the original submission. Any addition, deletion or rearrangement of author names in the authorship list should be made only before the manuscript has been accepted and only if approved by the journal Editor. To request such a change, the Editor must receive the following from the corresponding author: (a) the reason for the change in author list and (b) written confirmation (e-mail, letter) from all authors that they agree with the addition, removal or rearrangement. In the case of addition or removal of authors, this includes confirmation from the author being added or removed.\nOnly in exceptional circumstances will the Editor consider the addition, deletion or rearrangement of authors after the manuscript has been accepted. While the Editor considers the request, publication of the manuscript will be suspended. If the manuscript has already been published in an online issue, any requests approved by the Editor will result in a corrigendum.\nRandomized controlled trials should be presented according to the CONSORT guidelines. At manuscript submission, authors must provide the CONSORT checklist accompanied by a flow diagram that illustrates the progress of patients through the trial, including recruitment, enrollment, randomization, withdrawal and completion, and a detailed description of the randomization procedure. The\n[CONSORT checklist and template flow diagram](http://www.consort-statement.org) are available online. [International Committee of Medical Journal Editors](http://www.icmje.org)recommendations. Trials must register at or before the onset of patient enrolment. The clinical trial registration number should be included at the end of the abstract of the article. A clinical trial is defined as any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects of health outcomes. Health-related interventions include any intervention used to modify a biomedical or health-related outcome (for example drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, dietary interventions, and process-of-care changes). Health outcomes include any biomedical or health-related measures obtained in patients or participants, including pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events. Purely observational studies (those in which the assignment of the medical intervention is not at the discretion of the investigator) will not require registration.\nThis journal uses the Elsevier Article Transfer Service to find the best home for your manuscript. This means that if an editor feels your manuscript is more suitable for an alternative journal, you might be asked to consider transferring the manuscript to such a journal. The recommendation might be provided by a Journal Editor, a dedicated\n[Scientific Managing Editor](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/submit-your-paper/submit-and-revise/article-transfer-service/scientific-managing-editors), a tool assisted recommendation, or a combination. If you agree, your manuscript will be transferred, though you will have the opportunity to make changes to the manuscript before the submission is complete. Please note that your manuscript will be independently reviewed by the new journal. [More information](http://www.elsevier.com/authors/article-transfer-service).\nUpon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to complete a 'Journal Publishing Agreement' (see\n[more information](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright) on this). An e-mail will be sent to the corresponding author confirming receipt of the manuscript together with a 'Journal Publishing Agreement' form or a link to the online version of this agreement.\nSubscribers may reproduce tables of contents or prepare lists of articles including abstracts for internal circulation within their institutions.\n[Permission](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright/permissions) of the Publisher is required for resale or distribution outside the institution and for all other derivative works, including compilations and translations. If excerpts from other copyrighted works are included, the author(s) must obtain written permission from the copyright owners and credit the source(s) in the article.

Permitted third party reuse of open access articles is determined by the author's choice of [user license](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/open-access-licenses).\nAuthor rights\nAs an author you (or your employer or institution) have certain rights to reuse your work.\n[More information](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright).\nFind out how you can\n[share your research](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/submit-your-paper/sharing-and-promoting-your-article) published in Elsevier journals.\nYou are requested to identify who provided financial support for the conduct of the research and/or preparation of the article and to briefly describe the role of the sponsor(s), if any, in study design; in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; and in the decision to submit the article for publication. If the funding source(s) had no such involvement then this should be stated.\n[Researcher Academy](https://researcheracademy.elsevier.com/) is a free e-learning platform designed to support early and mid-career researchers throughout their research journey. The \"Learn\" environment at Researcher Academy offers several interactive modules, webinars, downloadable guides and resources to guide you through the process of writing for research and going through peer review. Feel free to use these free resources to improve your submission and navigate the publication process with ease.\nPlease write your text in good English (American or British usage is accepted, but not a mixture of these). Authors who feel their English language manuscript may require editing to eliminate possible grammatical or spelling errors and to conform to correct scientific English may wish to use the\n[English Language Editing service](https://webshop.elsevier.com/language-editing-services/language-editing/) available from Elsevier's Author Services.\nPlease submit your article via\n[www.e](http://www.evise.com/evise/jrnl/ddmec) [vise.com/evise/jrnl/REMNIM](http://www.evise.com/evise/jrnl/ddmec)\nPlease submit the names and institutional e-mail addresses of several potential referees.

Note that the editor retains the sole right to decide whether or not the suggested reviewers are used.\nThis journal operates a double anonymized review process. All contributions will be initially assessed by the editor for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed suitable are then typically sent to a minimum of two independent expert reviewers to assess the scientific quality of the paper. The Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles. The Editor's decision is final. Editors are not involved in decisions about papers which they have written themselves or have been written by family members or colleagues or which relate to products or services in which the editor has an interest. Any such submission is subject to all of the journal's usual procedures, with peer review handled independently of the relevant editor and their research groups.\n[More information on types of peer review](http://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/what-is-peer-review).\nThis journal uses double-anonymized review, which means the identities of the authors are concealed from the reviewers, and vice versa.\n[More information](http://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/what-is-peer-review) is available on our website. To facilitate this, please include the following separately:\nTitle page (with author details): This should include the title, authors' names affiliations, acknowledgements and any Declaration of Interest statement, and a complete address for the corresponding author including an e-mail address.\nAnonymized manuscript (no author details): The main body of the paper (including the references, figures, tables and any acknowledgements) should not include any identifying information, such as the authors' names or affiliations.\nIt is important that the file be saved in the native format of the word processor used. The text should be in single-column format. Keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. Most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. In particular, do not use the word processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words. However, do use bold face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. When preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. If no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. The electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the\n[Guide to Publishing with Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/submit-your-paper)). Note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. See also the section on Electronic artwork.\nTo avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor.\nDivide your article into clearly defined sections. Each subsection is given a brief heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line. Subsections should be used as much as possible when cross-referencing text: refer to the subsection by heading as opposed to simply 'the text'.\nState the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results.\nProvide sufficient details to allow the work to be reproduced by an independent researcher. Methods that are already published should be summarized, and indicated by a reference. If quoting directly from a previously published method, use quotation marks and also cite the source. Any modifications to existing methods should also be described.\nResults should be clear and concise.\nThis should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. A combined Results and Discussion section is often appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature.\nThe main conclusions of the study may be presented in a short Conclusions section, which may stand alone or form a subsection of a Discussion or Results and Discussion section.\nIf there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as A, B, etc. Formulae and equations in appendices should be given separate numbering: Eq. (A.1), Eq. (A.2), etc.; in a subsequent appendix, Eq. (B.1) and so on. Similarly for tables and figures: Table A.1; Fig. A.1, etc.\n\u2022 Title. Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible.\n\u2022 Author names and affiliations. Please clearly indicate the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately spelled. You can add your name between parentheses in your own script behind the English transliteration. Present the authors' affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name and, if available, the e-mail address of each author.\n\u2022 Corresponding author. Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. This responsibility includes answering any future queries about Methodology and Materials. Ensure that the e-mail address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author.\n\u2022 Present/permanent address. If an author has moved since the work described in the article was done, or was visiting at the time, a 'Present address' (or 'Permanent address') may be indicated as a footnote to that author's name. The address at which the author actually did the work must be retained as the main, affiliation address. Superscript Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes.\nHighlights are optional yet highly encouraged for this journal, as they increase the discoverability of your article via search engines. They consist of a short collection of bullet points that capture the novel results of your research as well as new methods that were used during the study (if any). Please have a look at the examples here:\n[example Highlights](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/highlights).\nHighlights should be submitted in a separate editable file in the online submission system. Please use 'Highlights' in the file name and include 3 to 5 bullet points (maximum 85 characters, including spaces, per bullet point).\nA structured abstract, by means of appropriate headings, should provide the context or background for the research and should state its purpose, basic procedures (selection of study subjects or laboratory animals, observational and analytical methods), main findings (giving specific effect sizes and their statistical significance, if possible), and principal conclusions. It should emphasize new and important aspects of the study or observations.\nThe headings will consist of: \u00abIntroduction and Objectives\u00bb, \u00abPatients or Materials and Methods\u00bb, \u00abResults\u00bb y \u00abConclusions\u00bb.\nAlthough a graphical abstract is optional, its use is encouraged as it draws more attention to the online article. The graphical abstract should summarize the contents of the article in a concise, pictorial form designed to capture the attention of a wide readership. Graphical abstracts should be submitted as a separate file in the online submission system. Image size: Please provide an image with a minimum of 531 \u00d7 1328 pixels (h \u00d7 w) or proportionally more. The image should be readable at a size of 5 \u00d7 13 cm using a regular screen resolution of 96 dpi. Preferred file types: TIFF, EPS, PDF or MS Office files. You can view\n[Example Graphical Abstracts](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/graphical-abstract) on our information site.\nAuthors can make use of Elsevier's Illustration and Enhancement service to ensure the best presentation of their images and in accordance with all technical requirements:\n[Illustration Service](http://webshop.elsevier.com/illustration-services/).\nImmediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 6 keywords, using British spelling and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, 'and', 'of'). Be sparing with abbreviations: only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. These keywords will be used for indexing purposes.\nList funding sources in this standard way to facilitate compliance to funder's requirements:\nFunding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA [grant number zzzz]; and the United States Institutes of Peace [grant number aaaa].\nIt is not necessary to include detailed descriptions on the program or type of grants and awards. When funding is from a block grant or other resources available to a university, college, or other research institution, submit the name of the institute or organization that provided the funding.\nIf no funding has been provided for the research, please include the following sentence:\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nWhilst it is accepted that authors sometimes need to manipulate images for clarity, manipulation for purposes of deception or fraud will be seen as scientific ethical abuse and will be dealt with accordingly. For graphical images, this journal is applying the following policy: no specific feature within an image may be enhanced, obscured, moved, removed, or introduced. Adjustments of brightness, contrast, or color balance are acceptable if and as long as they do not obscure or eliminate any information present in the original. Nonlinear adjustments (e.g. changes to gamma settings) must be disclosed in the figure legend.\nGeneral points\n\u2022 Make sure you use uniform lettering and sizing of your original artwork.\n\u2022 Embed the used fonts if the application provides that option.\n\u2022 Aim to use the following fonts in your illustrations: Arial, Courier, Times New Roman, Symbol, or use fonts that look similar.\n\u2022 Number the illustrations according to their sequence in the text.\n\u2022 Use a logical naming convention for your artwork files.\n\u2022 Provide captions to illustrations separately.\n\u2022 Size the illustrations close to the desired dimensions of the published version.\n\u2022 Submit each illustration as a separate file.\n\u2022 Ensure that color images are accessible to all, including those with impaired color vision.\nA detailed\n[guide on electronic artwork](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-schemas/artwork-and-media-instructions) is available.\nYou are urged to visit this site; some excerpts from the detailed information are given here.\nFormats\nIf your electronic artwork is created in a Microsoft Office application (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) then please supply 'as is' in the native document format.\nRegardless of the application used other than Microsoft Office, when your electronic artwork is finalized, please 'Save as' or convert the images to one of the following formats (note the resolution requirements for line drawings, halftones, and line/halftone combinations given below):\nEPS (or PDF): Vector drawings, embed all used fonts.\nTIFF (or JPEG): Color or grayscale photographs (halftones), keep to a minimum of 300 dpi.\nTIFF (or JPEG): Bitmapped (pure black & white pixels) line drawings, keep to a minimum of 1000 dpi.\nTIFF (or JPEG): Combinations bitmapped line/half-tone (color or grayscale), keep to a minimum of 500 dpi.\nPlease do not:\n\u2022 Supply files that are optimized for screen use (e.g., GIF, BMP, PICT, WPG); these typically have a low number of pixels and limited set of colors;\n\u2022 Supply files that are too low in resolution;\n\u2022 Submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the content.\nPlease make sure that artwork files are in an acceptable format (TIFF (or JPEG), EPS (or PDF) or MS Office files) and with the correct resolution. If, together with your accepted article, you submit usable color figures then Elsevier will ensure, at no additional charge, that these figures will appear in color online (e.g., ScienceDirect and other sites).\n[Further information on the preparation of electronic artwork](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-schemas/artwork-and-media-instructions).\nEnsure that each illustration has a caption. Supply captions separately, not attached to the figure. A caption should comprise a brief title (not on the figure itself) and a description of the illustration. Keep text in the illustrations themselves to a minimum but explain all symbols and abbreviations used.\nPlease submit tables as editable text and not as images. Tables can be placed either next to the relevant text in the article, or on separate page(s) at the end. Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text and place any table notes below the table body. Be sparing in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in them do not duplicate results described elsewhere in the article. Please avoid using vertical rules and shading in table cells.\nPlease ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice versa). Any references cited in the abstract must be given in full. Unpublished results and personal communications are not recommended in the reference list, but may be mentioned in the text. If these references are included in the reference list they should follow the standard reference style of the journal and should include a substitution of the publication date with either 'Unpublished results' or 'Personal communication'. Citation of a reference as 'in press' implies that the item has been accepted for publication.\nIncreased discoverability of research and high quality peer review are ensured by online links to the sources cited. In order to allow us to create links to abstracting and indexing services, such as Scopus, CrossRef and PubMed, please ensure that data provided in the references are correct. Please note that incorrect surnames, journal/book titles, publication year and pagination may prevent link creation. When copying references, please be careful as they may already contain errors. Use of the DOI is highly encouraged.\nA DOI is guaranteed never to change, so you can use it as a permanent link to any electronic article. An example of a citation using DOI for an article not yet in an issue is: VanDecar J.C., Russo R.M., James D.E., Ambeh W.B., Franke M. (2003). Aseismic continuation of the Lesser Antilles slab beneath northeastern Venezuela. Journal of Geophysical Research,\n[https://doi.org/10.1029/2001JB000884](https://doi.org/10.1029/2001JB000884). Please note the format of such citations should be in the same style as all other references in the paper.\nAs a minimum, the full URL should be given and the date when the reference was last accessed. Any further information, if known (DOI, author names, dates, reference to a source publication, etc.), should also be given. Web references can be listed separately (e.g., after the reference list) under a different heading if desired, or can be included in the reference list.\nThis journal encourages you to cite underlying or relevant datasets in your manuscript by citing them in your text and including a data reference in your Reference List. Data references should include the following elements: author name(s), dataset title, data repository, version (where available), year, and global persistent identifier. Add [dataset] immediately before the reference so we can properly identify it as a data reference. This identifier will not appear in your published article.\nWhere a preprint has subsequently become available as a peer-reviewed publication, the formal publication should be used as the reference. If there are preprints that are central to your work or that cover crucial developments in the topic, but are not yet formally published, these may be referenced. Preprints should be clearly marked as such, for example by including the word preprint, or the name of the preprint server, as part of the reference. The preprint DOI should also be provided.\nPlease ensure that the words 'this issue' are added to any references in the list (and any citations in the text) to other articles in the same Special Issue.\nMost Elsevier journals have their reference template available in many of the most popular reference management software products. These include all products that support\n[Citation Style Language styles](https://citationstyles.org), such as [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/reference-manager/). Using citation plug-ins from these products, authors only need to select the appropriate journal template when preparing their article, after which citations and bibliographies will be automatically formatted in the journal's style. If no template is yet available for this journal, please follow the format of the sample references and citations as shown in this Guide. If you use reference management software, please ensure that you remove all field codes before submitting the electronic manuscript. [More information on how to remove field codes from different reference management software](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/26093).\nText: Indicate references by superscript numbers in the text. The actual authors can be referred to, but the reference number(s) must always be given.\nList: Number the references in the list in the order in which they appear in the text.\nExamples:\nReference to a journal publication:\n1.

For further details you are referred to 'Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts submitted to Biomedical Journals' (J Am Med Assoc 1997;277:927\u00bf34)(see also\n[Samples of Formatted References](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html)).\nJournal names should be abbreviated according to the\n[List of Title Word Abbreviations](https://www.issn.org/services/online-services/access-to-the-ltwa/).\nElsevier accepts video material and animation sequences to support and enhance your scientific research. Authors who have video or animation files that they wish to submit with their article are strongly encouraged to include links to these within the body of the article. This can be done in the same way as a figure or table by referring to the video or animation content and noting in the body text where it should be placed. All submitted files should be properly labeled so that they directly relate to the video file's content. In order to ensure that your video or animation material is directly usable, please provide the file in one of our recommended file formats with a preferred maximum size of 150 MB per file, 1 GB in total. Video and animation files supplied will be published online in the electronic version of your article in Elsevier Web products, including\n[ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com). Please supply 'stills' with your files: you can choose any frame from the video or animation or make a separate image. These will be used instead of standard icons and will personalize the link to your video data. For more detailed instructions please visit our [video instruction pages](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-schemas/artwork-and-media-instructions). Note: since video and animation cannot be embedded in the print version of the journal, please provide text for both the electronic and the print version for the portions of the article that refer to this content.\nSupplementary material such as applications, images and sound clips, can be published with your article to enhance it. Submitted supplementary items are published exactly as they are received (Excel or PowerPoint files will appear as such online). Please submit your material together with the article and supply a concise, descriptive caption for each supplementary file. If you wish to make changes to supplementary material during any stage of the process, please make sure to provide an updated file. Do not annotate any corrections on a previous version. Please switch off the 'Track Changes' option in Microsoft Office files as these will appear in the published version.\nThis journal encourages and enables you to share data that supports your research publication where appropriate, and enables you to interlink the data with your published articles. Research data refers to the results of observations or experimentation that validate research findings. To facilitate reproducibility and data reuse, this journal also encourages you to share your software, code, models, algorithms, protocols, methods and other useful materials related to the project.\nBelow are a number of ways in which you can associate data with your article or make a statement about the availability of your data when submitting your manuscript. If you are sharing data in one of these ways, you are encouraged to cite the data in your manuscript and reference list. Please refer to the \"References\" section for more information about data citation. For more information on depositing, sharing and using research data and other relevant research materials, visit the\n[research data page](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-resources/research-data).\nIf you have made your research data available in a data repository, you can link your article directly to the dataset. Elsevier collaborates with a number of repositories to link articles on ScienceDirect with relevant repositories, giving readers access to underlying data that give them a better understanding of the research described.\nThere are different ways to link your datasets to your article. When available, you can directly link your dataset to your article by providing the relevant information in the submission system. For more information, visit the\n[database linking page](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/tools-and-resources/research-data/data-base-linking).\nFor\n[supported data repositories](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/tools-and-resources/research-data/data-base-linking#repositories) a repository banner will automatically appear next to your published article on ScienceDirect.\nIn addition, you can link to relevant data or entities through identifiers within the text of your manuscript, using the following format: Database: xxxx (e.g., TAIR: AT1G01020; CCDC: 734053; PDB: 1XFN).\nOne set of page proofs (as PDF files) will be sent by e-mail to the corresponding author (if we do not have an e-mail address then paper proofs will be sent by post) or a link will be provided in the e-mail so that authors can download the files themselves. To ensure a fast publication process of the article, we kindly ask authors to provide us with their proof corrections within two days. Elsevier now provides authors with PDF proofs which can be annotated; for this you will need to\n[download the free Adobe Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader), version 9 (or higher). Instructions on how to annotate PDF files will accompany the proofs (also given online). The exact system requirements are given at the [Adobe site](https://helpx.adobe.com/reader/system-requirements.html).\nIf you do not wish to use the PDF annotations function, you may list the corrections (including replies to the Query Form) and return them to Elsevier in an e-mail. Please list your corrections quoting line number. If, for any reason, this is not possible, then mark the corrections and any other comments (including replies to the Query Form) on a printout of your proof and scan the pages and return via e-mail. Please use this proof only for checking the typesetting, editing, completeness and correctness of the text, tables and figures. Significant changes to the article as accepted for publication will only be considered at this stage with permission from the Editor. We will do everything possible to get your article published quickly and accurately. It is important to ensure that all corrections are sent back to us in one communication: please check carefully before replying, as inclusion of any subsequent corrections cannot be guaranteed. Proofreading is solely your responsibility.\nThe corresponding author will, at no cost, receive a customized\n[Share Link](http://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/share-link) providing 50 days free access to the final published version of the article on [ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/). The Share Link can be used for sharing the article via any communication channel, including email and social media. For an extra charge, paper offprints can be ordered via the offprint order form which is sent once the article is accepted for publication. Both corresponding and co-authors may order offprints at any time via [Elsevier's Author Services](https://webshop.elsevier.com/article-services/article-offprints/). Corresponding authors who have published their article open access do not receive a Share Link as their final published version of the article is available open access on ScienceDirect and can be shared through the article DOI link.\nVisit the\n[Elsevier Support Center](https://service.elsevier.com/app/home/supporthub/publishing) to find the answers you need. Here you will find everything from Frequently Asked Questions to ways to get in touch.\nYou can also\n[check the status of your submitted
