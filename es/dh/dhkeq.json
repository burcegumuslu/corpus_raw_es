Major sources ofpollution are: (i) chemical and pharmaceutical industries thatproduce a wide array of xenobiotics and synthetic polymers;(ii) pulp and paper bleaching, which are the main sources ofchlorinated organic compounds in the environment; (iii) min-ing, which releases heavy metals into biogeochemical cycles;(iv) fossil fuels (coal and petroleum), which may be acciden-Eduardo D\u00edaz\nDepartment of Molecular\nMicrobiology, Biological ResearchCenter-CSIC, Madrid, SpainINTERNATIONAL MICROBIOLOGY (2004) 7:173\u2013180 \nwww.im.microbios.org\nReceived 29 March 2004\nAccepted 28 May 2004\nAddress for correspondence:\nDepartamento de Microbiolog\u00eda MolecularCentro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas-CSICRamiro de Maeztu, 928040 Madrid, Spain Tel. +34-918373112.

Therefore, the main, if not the only, successful strat-egy to fight pollution is the use and manipulation of the detox-ification abilities of living organisms (bioremediation) (Fig. 1)[8,16,31,33,34]. Although most organisms are endowed withdetoxification abilities, i.e mineralization, transformationand/or immobilization of pollutants, microorganisms, partic-ularly bacteria, have been the most well-studied and the mostfrequently used for bioremediation strategies. \nBacteria, which evolved more than three billion years\nago, have developed strategies for obtaining energy from vir-tually every compound. They play a crucial role in sustain-able development of the biosphere and in biogeochemicalcycles. The abundance of microorganisms, together withtheir great ability for horizontal gene transfer and their highgrowth rates, allows them to evolve quickly and to adapt toenvironmentally changing conditions, even to extreme envi-ronments that do not allow proliferation of other living\norganisms. The great genetic diversity of microorganismsaccounts for their great metabolic versatility [6,16,27].\nMicrobial utilization of aromatic compounds \nNext to glucosyl residues, the benzene ring is the unit of\nchemical structure most widely spread in nature. Moreover,the thermodynamic stability of the benzene ring increases itspersistence in the environment; therefore, many aromaticcompounds are major environmental pollutants [4]. Byexpressing different catabolic (biodegradative) pathways,microorganisms can use a wide array of aromatic compoundsas sole carbon and energy sources [14]. The general ability ofbacteria to use such compounds is related to the fact thatmost of these compounds are commonly present in the envi-ronment as a result of the recycling of plant-derived material[15]. Human-made xenobiotic compounds, by contrast, havebeen in contact with the microbiota only for about 100 years;therefore, some of them are still poorly degraded, if at all.Oxygen is the most common final electron acceptor formicrobial respiration, and aerobic processes provide the high-est amount of energy to cells (Fig. 2) [10]. In chemotrophicreactions, a portion of the substrate is oxidized to obtain ener-gy and another part is assimilated into cell mass. In aerobicrespiration, oxygen not only is the electron acceptor but alsoparticipates in activation of the substrate via oxygenationreactions.\nAlthough a wide phylogenetic diversity of micro-\norganisms is capable of aerobic degradation of contaminants,Pseudomonas species and closely related organisms have\nbeen the most extensively studied owing to their ability todegrade so many different contaminants [32]. However,many polluted environments are often anoxic, e.g., aquifers,aquatic sediments and submerged soils. In such environ-ments, biodegradation is carried out by either strict anaerobesor facultative microorganisms using alternative electronacceptors, such as nitrate (denitrifying organisms), sulfate(sulfate reducers), Fe(III) (ferric-ion reducers), CO\n2 (metha-\nnogens), or other acceptors (chlorate, Mn, Cr, U, etc.) (Fig. 2)[13,16,35].\nThe use of electron acceptors other than oxygen is based\non: (i) the electron-acceptor availability and (ii) the competi-tion of different respiratory types of microorganisms for elec-tron donors. For example, reduction of Fe(III) is the most fre-quent mechanism for oxidation of organic matter in subsur-face environments. Sulfate is a major electron acceptor forthe anaerobic degradation of contaminants in marine envi-ronments due to the high concentrations of sulfate in seawa-D\u00cdAZ\nFig. 1. Main sources of pollution in the ecosystem and the factors that influ-\nence bioremediation processes.\nInt. Microbiol.175 INT. M ICROBIOL . V ol. 7, 2004\nter [16]. In terms of energy, whereas degradation of aromatics\nusing nitrate and Fe(III) as terminal electron acceptors isalmost as efficient as that using oxygen, sulfate reducers andmethanogenic conditions generate comparatively much lessenergy (Fig. 2) [10]. Consequently, the molar cell yieldsunder methanogenic and sulfidogenic conditions are ratherlow. Fermentative strains tend to be restricted to a syntrophic\nexistence because complete biodegradation becomes energet-ically favorable only when accompanying methanogens orsulfate-reducing bacteria promptly use the metabolic end-products generated during aromatic compound breakdownby fermenters (Fig. 2) [13]. Photosynthetic bacteria obtainenergy from light and they degrade aromatic compoundsanaerobically to form intermediary metabolites, such asacetyl-CoA, which are subsequently used in biosyntheticreactions (Fig. 2) [13]. Some aromatic compounds serve aselectron acceptors rather than electron donors in bioremedia-tion reactions. Thus, an important type of bioremediation isreductive dechlorination, in which bacteria remove chlorinesfrom contaminants, such as chlorinated solvents and PCBs,by using these compounds as electron acceptors in dehalores-piration [9,13].Aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation of aromatic com-\npounds have several common features. Structurally diversecompounds are degraded through many different peripheralpathways to a few intermediates that are further channeledvia a few central pathways to the central metabolism of thecell. In the aerobic catabolic funnel, most peripheral path-ways involve oxygenation reactions carried out by monooxy-genases and/or hydroxylating dioxygenases that generatedihydroxy aromatic compounds (catechol, protocatechuate,gentisate, homoprotocatechuate, homogentisate, hydroquinone,hydroxyquinol). These intermediate compounds are the sub-strates of ring-cleavage enzymes that use molecular oxygento open the aromatic ring between the two hydroxyl groups(ortho cleavage, catalyzed by intradiol dioxygenases) orproximal to one of the two hydroxyl groups (meta cleavage,catalyzed by extradiol dioxygenases) (Fig. 3) [14].\nCentral pathways involve a series of reactions leading to\nthe formation of Krebs cycle intermediates (central metabo-lism). In the anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds,the peripheral pathways converge to benzoyl-CoA (occasion-ally to resorcinol and phloroglucinol), which becomes dearo-matized by a specific multicomponent reductase that requiresBACTERIAL DEGRADATION OF POLLUTANTS\nFig. 2.

Methanogenesis needs to be coupled to fermentation reactions. Bacterial genera representative of each type of met abolism are shown in paren-\ntheses. Modified from [35].\nInt. Microbiol.176 INT. M ICROBIOL . V ol. 7, 2004\nenergy in the form of ATP (Fig. 4A) [13]. Finally, aerobic\nhybrid pathways, such as that for phenylacetic acid degrada-tion, combine anaerobic features (initial formation of CoAderivatives) with typical aerobic reactions such as aromatic-ring oxygenation (Fig. 4B) [17]. Whereas pathways involvedin degradation of xenobiotic compounds, such as those carry-ing halogen atoms or nitro groups, are only present in certainstrains, those involved in the catabolism of common aromat-ic compounds, such as benzoate or aromatic amino acids, arewidespread [23].\nGenetics and evolution of biodegradation\npathways\nThe genes responsible for biodegradation pathways are usu-\nally arranged in clusters that comprise: (i) catabolic genesencoding the enzymatic steps of the catabolic pathway; (ii)transport genes responsible for active uptake of the com-pound; and (iii) regulatory genes that adjust expression of thecatabolic and transport genes to the presence of the com-pound to be degraded [7]. Bacteria thriving in the environ-ment are exposed to a range of physical and chemical signalsthat need to be processed to achieve a positive or negativephysiological response. For instance, bacteria are usuallyconfronted with alternative carbon sources and they must\n\u201cdecide\u201d which of them will be preferentially consumedbefore metabolizing less preferred substrates, such as pollu-tants, to guarantee, therefore, a satisfactory metabolic return.In order to achieve this goal, bacteria have developed a phys-iological response (superimposed regulation) that controlsand adjusts the specific regulation of catabolic operons to thephysiological and metabolic state of the cells [2]. The cata-bolic clusters are usually present in mobile genetic elements,such as transposons and plasmids, which facilitate their hor-izontal transfer of the respective genes and, therefore, rapidadaptation of microorganisms to the presence of new pollu-tants in a particular ecosystem [26,30].\nAlthough microorganisms have acquired the ability to use\npollutants as carbon and energy sources, their efficiency atremoving such pollutants might not be optimal for cleaningup present-day pollution. In fact, microorganisms haveevolved towards ecological fitness rather than biotechnolog-ical efficiency; thus, it would take a long time for bacteriacapable of cleaning up anthropogenic pollution to evolve bynatural selection. Hence, studying the physiology, biochem-istry and genetics of the catabolic pathways becomes crucialto recreate and accelerate natural processes in the test tube aswell as to accomplish their rational manipulation to designmore efficient biocatalysts for different biotechnological appli-cations. These include: (i) bioremediation of polluted sites, (ii)\nbiotransformation of toxic compounds into fine chemicalsand other high added-value products (green chemistry), and(iii) development of in situ biomonitoring devices and\nbiosensors to monitor pollutant bioavailability [6,25,27]. Themain limitations for the use of microorganisms in cleaning-up pollutants are summarized in Fig. 5, and some strategiesto overcome these restrictions are presented below.\nDesigning recombinant bacteria for bioremediation\nTo enhance the metabolic efficiency of a microorganism for\na particular environmental application, engineering should becarried out at two different levels: (i) manipulation of the spe-cific catabolic pathway, and (ii) manipulation of the host cell.In order to improve the rate of pollutant removal and broaden\nthe range of substrates of a catabolic pathway, manipulationof the key enzymes of both the pathway and the regulatorymechanisms that control the expression of the catabolicgenes will be required [6,27]. Protein stability and proteinactivity can be altered and/or improved by protein engineer-ing and rationally directed molecular evolution techniques(DNA shuffling and other in vitro recombination methods)D\u00cdAZ\nFig. 3. The catabolic funnel for the aerobic degradation of aromatics. White\narrows , peripheral pathways, black arrows , cleavage of the ring; gray\narrows , central pathways.\nInt. Microbiol.177 INT. M ICROBIOL . V ol. 7, 2004\n[11,27]. Moreover, metabolic engineering allows the genera-\ntion of novel hybrid pathways by assembling catabolic mod-ules from different origins in the same host cell, thus leadingto pathway expansion to new substrates, completion ofincomplete pathways, the creation of new routes, and con-struction of bacteria with multiple pathways [20,23,24,27].The rational combination of catabolic pathways may allowthe complete metabolism of xenobiotics, as has been shownwith the development of bacteria capable of mineralizingPCBs, and can prevent the formation of dead-end productsand toxic metabolites by misrouting of the pollutants [20,27]. \nBacteria used to remediate pollutants probably undergo\nenvironmental stress due to high concentrations of toxic con-taminants, toxic solvents, extreme pH, temperature, ionicstrength, etc. [27]. The combination in a single bacterialstrain of different degradative abilities with genetic traits thatprovide selective advantages in the target site is a successfulstrategy for in situ bioremediation [20]. For instance, solvent-\nresistant strains may be ideal hosts to construct geneticallyengineered microorganisms for the removal of wastes withhigh solvent contents [20,22]. Heavy metals, including Hg,Cd and As, are currently major sources of pollution and can-not be destroyed or biodegraded. Recombinant microorgan-isms have been developed to accumulate and/or immobilizeheavy metals present in soil and water [18,29]. As some met-als can serve as terminal electron acceptors in microbial res-piration, anaerobes that use them have been applied to reducethe soluble oxidized form of the metal to the insoluble form,\nthereby preventing its further spread in the environment [16].Some polluted environments contain a mixture of organicwastes, heavy metals and high-energy radionuclides. In thiscontext, radiation-resistant bacteria are being geneticallyengineered with biodegradation genes to render them suitablefor the treatment of such mixed wastes [5,20,31].\nOne of the main reasons for the persistence of some aro-\nmatic compounds in the environment is their limitedbioavailability. This is the case of hydrocarbons present infossil fuels, which are frequently attached to soil particles.The host cell can be manipulated to enhance bioavailabilityof the pollutant by engineering the production of biosurfac-tants or by promoting chemotaxis of the biodegrader to thetoxic compound [8,23]. Surfactant production has been com-bined with the ability to selectively cleave carbon-sulfurbonds in the sulfur-containing compounds present in oil(biodesulfurization) and, hence, efficient recombinantbiodesulfurizers have been obtained [12]. Some anaerobesrelease Fe(III) chelators, which solubilize Fe(III) fromFe(III) oxides, and electron-shuttling compounds, whichaccept electrons from the cell surface and then reduce Fe(III)oxides. It has been shown that enhancing the availability ofsome electron acceptors, such as the insoluble Fe(III)oxides, by adding suitable ligands can greatly stimulateanaerobic degradation of contaminants in subsurface envi-ronments [16].BACTERIAL DEGRADATION OF POLLUTANTS\nFig. 4. (A) Anaerobic degradation of benzoate. ( B) Aerobic hybrid pathway for the catabolism of phenylacetate.\nInt. Microbiol.178 INT. M ICROBIOL . V ol. 7, 2004\nBiosafety is a major issue when releasing recombinant\nmicroorganisms into any open environment. In order toaddress this concern, several genetic circuits have beendeveloped to allow survival of the recombinant microorgan-ism only when present in the polluted site and during the timerequired for removal of the pollutant (biological contain-ment). To avoid dispersal of the recombinant trait from therecombinant bacteria to the native microbial population, dif-ferent gene-containment circuits based on a toxin and its cog-nate antidote have also been developed. Such active contain-ment systems reduce significantly the potential risks thatrelease of recombinant bacteria might cause in the ecosystem[21,28].\nDeveloping syntrophic bacterial consortia for bioremediation\nIt is not always possible to combine in one only organism all\nthe required features to solve a given environmental problem,as is the case for the removal of complex mixtures in sewageplants. Under these circumstances, a suitable strategy is thegeneration of syntrophic bacterial consortia whose membersare specialized in certain biodegradative steps or in the degra-dation of certain pollutants [24,27]. Plant-microbe interactionsare also a feasible alternative to remove toxic compounds frompolluted environments (rhizoremediation). Bioremediation\nstrategies involving transgenic plants that express bacterialgenes for the immobilization of heavy metals or TNT removal\n(phytoremediation) are currently cost-effective green tech-\nnologies of great public and scientific interest [20,34].\nIdeally, bioremediation strategies would be designed\nbased on knowledge of the microorganisms present in thepolluted environments, their metabolic abilities, and howthey respond to changes in environmental conditions. Theadvent of high-throughput methods for DNA sequencing andanalysis of gene expression (whole-genome DNA microar-rays) and function (proteomic techniques), as well asadvances in the modeling of microbial metabolism ( in silico\nbiology), are providing new insights into environmentalmicrobiology [16]. Biodegradation network models havebeen created that provide the basis for both predicting theabilities of existing or not-yet synthesized chemicals toundergo biodegradation and quantifying the evolutionary ratefor their elimination in the future [19]. However, in practice,much of the required information is not yet available, and theuse of microorganisms in bioremediation is highly empiricalrather than knowledge-based. An alternative approach thathas been shown to be successful for the treatment of someenvironmental disasters, including marine oil spills, is theaddition of limiting nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous, etc.) tothe polluted site to enhance growth of the native microbiotaable to degrade hydrocarbons (biostimulation) [34].

Hence, the huge poten-tial of environmental microbiology will become crucial forpromoting the welfare and sustainable growth of our society.\nAcknowledgements .Research in our laboratory is supported by grants\n07M/0127/2000 and 07M/0076/2002 from the Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma deMadrid, grants BIO2000-1076, BIO2003-01482, VEM2003-20075-CO2-02,and GEN2001-4698-CO5-02 from the CICYT, and by the EU contractQLRT-2001-02884.\nReferences\n1.

Aunque la mayor\u00eda de los organismos pueden detoxificar el\nambiente (mediante procesos de mineralizaci\u00f3n, transformaci\u00f3n y/o inmovi-lizaci\u00f3n de los contaminantes), los microorganismos, especialmente las bac-terias, desempe\u00f1an un papel esencial en los ciclos biogeoqu\u00edmicos y en eldesarrollo sostenible de la biosfera. Despu\u00e9s de los residuos glucosilados, elanillo de benceno es la unidad qu\u00edmica estructural m\u00e1s frecuente en la natu-raleza, y muchos compuestos arom\u00e1ticos son contaminantes importantes. Lasbacterias han desarrollado estrategias para obtener energ\u00eda de todo tipo decompuestos mediante procesos aer\u00f3bicos o anaer\u00f3bicos (utilizando aceptoresfinales de electrones alternativos como los iones nitrato, sulfato y f\u00e9rrico).Los grupos de genes que intervienen en el catabolismo de compuestosarom\u00e1ticos suelen localizarse en elementos gen\u00e9ticos m\u00f3viles, tales comotransposones y pl\u00e1smidos. Dicha localizaci\u00f3n facilita su transferencia a otrosorganismos y, por tanto, la r\u00e1pida adaptaci\u00f3n de los microorganismos anuevos contaminantes. Una estrategia que se ha empleado con \u00e9xito en pro-cesos de biorremediaci\u00f3n in situ es la combinaci\u00f3n, en una \u00fanica cepa bacte-\nriana o en un consorcio microbiano, de diferentes capacidades degradadorascon otras caracter\u00edsticas gen\u00e9ticas que aporten alguna ventaja selectiva en unambiente determinado. Los m\u00e9todos de alto rendimiento de secuenciaci\u00f3n deDNA y de an\u00e1lisis global de la expresi\u00f3n g\u00e9nica (gen\u00f3mica) y funcional (pro-te\u00f3mica), junto con los avances en los modelos in silico del metabolismo\nmicrobiano, proporcionan un enfoque global y racional para conocer lasenormes posibilidades, a\u00fan inexploradas en su mayor parte, de la utilizaci\u00f3nde los microorganismos en procesos de biotecnolog\u00eda ambiental que facilitenel desarrollo sostenible.
