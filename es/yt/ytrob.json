The major producers of olives and olive oil are \nSpain, Italy and Greece. Concretely, Spain was able to produce around 127100 tons of olive oil in the \nlast year according to the Agency of Olive Oil (Romani et al. , 2019) .  The fruit and compression \nextracted oil have a widespread of therapeutic and culinary uses.  \nOlive oil is  considered an excellent source of lipids, phenolic constituents and squalene, among \nothers, being associated with the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases \noutcomes  and  it has also been linked  to a reduced incidence  of   inflamma tory diseases and  cancer  \nparticularly skin, colon and breast   (C\u00e1rdeno, S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo and Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra, 2013; \nMarcelino et al. , 2019) . More recently , it has been well established the potential observed \nimmunomodulatory effect s of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) in different autoimmune  experimental \nanimal models such as inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD), rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) and systemic \nlupus erythematosus  (SLE) (Cardeno et al. , 2014; Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2016; Rosillo et al. , 2016a) . \nIn addition to olive oil, there are  also other  interesting beneficial components  in the olive tree. \nThis is the case of  the olive tree le af and fruit s,  which are  an abundant source of biophenols of \nparticular interest as food supplements and variou s industrial applications in   cosmetic and \npharmaceutical industries (Benincasa et al. , 2019) . \nThe phenolic composition of olive leaf  and fruit  varies according to plant variety, harvesting \nseason and method, maturity and extraction method. Normally, the main chemical com pound in \nunprocessed olive leaves  and drupes is oleuropein (OL) , a secoiridoid, ester of elenolic acid and 3,4 -\ndihydroxyphenyl ethanol .   Its   degradat ion results in the formation of  hydroxytyrosol (HTy) in olive \noil.  In addition , other polyphenols such as caffeic  acid,  chlorogenic   acid , flavan -3-ols (catechin) and  \nflavonoids, including luteolin 7 -O glucoside, kaempherol -3-O-glucoside , rutin,  quercetin   3-O-\nglucoside  and apigenin -7-O-glucoside  are also present   (Herrero et al. , 2011; Castejon et al. , 2019; \nGon\u00e7alves et al. , 2019) . \nOL has  catechol functionality and exerts potent and well -stablished antioxidant activity, mostly  \ncorrelated to its ability to enhance radical stability through the formation of an intramolecular \nhydrogen bond between  the free hydrogen of the hydroxyl group and its phenoxyl radicals  (Visioli, \nBellomo and Galli, 1998) . OL also possesses a well -documented  anti-atherogenic , anti-cancer, anti -\nangiogenic,  neuroprotective, antimicrobial and antiviral , gastroprotective , hepatoprotective , \nantidiabetic, antiobesity  and radioprotective  activities , among others (Hassen, Casabianca and Hosni, \n2015) . \nInteresting several studies have reported important anti -inflammatory properties of this \nsecoiridoid  (Barbaro et al. , 2014; Marcelino et al. , 2019) . In addition, it has the ab ility to scavenge nitric \noxide (NO) and it also promotes the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) in cells \n(de la Puerta et al. , 2001) . \nBesides ,  OL was able to suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated RAW 264 (Ryu et al. , \n2015) . Also OL exert ed a significantly protective effect on cartilage slowing down the progression of \nosteoarthritic lesions in Guinea pigs  (Horcajada et al. , 2015) .  Likewise, OL -aglycone improved clinical \nmarkers and histological status in joints and paws on collagen induced arthritis (CIA)  mice model \n(Impellizzeri et al. , 2011) . Indeed, OL has been shown to in hibit pulmonary inflammation  in   Abstract  \n \n4 \n experim ental models of interleukin (IL) -4-exposed bronchial BEAS -2B epithelial cells and ovalbumin \nor cigarette smoke exposed BALB/c mice  (Kim et al. , 2018) .  \nOn the other hand, s ome studies have shown the importance of ac etylated derivatives obtained \nfrom natural phenols , as a value alternative for improving the properties of the original molecules, for \nexample, bioavailability, cell membrane penetration and enhanced anti -inflammatory and antioxidant \nactivities . So, the ac etylation of these natural compounds may improve  pharmacodynamics and \npharmacokinetic profiles of the  natural compounds and it could be an appealing strategy in the \nmanagement of different inflammatory process  (de Ara\u00fajo et al. , 2017; Rizzo et al. , 2017) . \nImmune cell plasticity is mainly involved in the pathogenesis and resolution of chronic \ninflammatory autoimmune processes  such as RA and SLE. Dietary components, especiall y dietary \nfatty acids and poly phenols, modulate the immune response and they might be expli cit as a pharma -\nnutritional methodology for the prevention and management of these illnesses  (Ricordi, Garcia -\nContreras and Farnetti, 2015) .  \nRA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder characterized by inflammation of the \nsynovial membrane and it course s with a progressive destruction of the cartilage and bone . Its \npathogenesis involved the activation of innate and adoptive immune cells, resident cells such as \nosteoclasts, fibroblast -like synoviocytes and chondrocytes, as well as certain autoantibodies , \nrheumatoid factor and anti -citrullinates peptide antibodies. Of note, activated T cells release cytokines \nthat activate macrophages to secrete other proinflammatory  cytokines, inducing the d ifferentiation of \nB cells and activate the release of metalloprotei nases  (MMPs ) (Salgado and Maneiro, 2014) . \nThe p harmacological treatment in RA includes non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \nglucocorticoids, disease -modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biological agents . The \nobjective of conventional pharma cological therapy is to finish or reverse car tilage destruction and \ndiminish the pain devoid of untoward effect s. However, current treatments are not efficient in all \npatients and possess a  number of disadvantages, such as high cost, necessity for parenteral \nadministration and potential adverse effec ts. Consequently, nutritional therapy as complementary \nand alternative medicine is under development  as an innovative strategy in RA management  (Gaforio \net al. , 2019) . \nAnother autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disease currently actively investigated is SLE. \nUnlike the previous pathology , SLE a ffect s multiple organ system s including joints, skin, kidn eys and \nthe brain, among others. One characteristic of SLE is its pathogenic complexity, wh at makes  its \ndiagnosis difficult , among a high number of complications that can affect the quality of life of patients \n(Petri et al. , 2013) .  In fact genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors, as well as nutrition and \ninfection,  are involved  concur . Immune complexes, autoantibodies, imbala nce of T -helper cell subsets \n(Th)-1/Th2/Th17 and regulatory T -cells (Tregs), play an important role in SLE tissue damage  (Noble \net al. , 2016) . \nTypical management of SLE includes the use of low -dose glucocorticoids, NSAIDs and also, \nantimalarial drugs, immunosuppressive agents and biological drugs (Kuhn et al. , 2015; Rosillo, \nAlarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra and S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo, 2016) . Moreover, diet quality in SLE patients is relevant \nsince these patients su ffer a higher risk of other pathologies which are directly influenced by diet. \nTherefore, nutritional therapy by means of diet changes and the use of nutritional supplements could   Abstract  \n \n5 \n be a promising tool for SLE due, possibly reducing comorbidities and improving  quality of life in SLE \npatients  (Aparicio -Soto, S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo and Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra, 2017) . \nConsidering this background  the objectives  of this Doctoral Thesis  have been the following : \n1. To investigate the potential immunomodulatory and anti -inflammatory effects of  OL and its \nsemi -synthetic acetyl -derivatives  as well as  to explore the molecular mechanisms and \nsignaling pathways involved on: \n \n1.a. An ex vivo  model of murine peritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPS.  \n \n1.b. An in vitro  model of human IL -1\u03b2-stimulated synovial fibroblasts cell line (SW982).  \n \n2. To explore  the effects of OL  and peracetylated OL (Per-OL), e nriched diets in a model of RA \ncollagen -type II induced arthritis in DBAJ/1 mice and clarify  the molecular mechanism s and \nsignaling pathways involved.  \n \n3. To study  the potential effect s of OL and Per -OL en riched diets in a m odel of SLE induced by \npristane (2,6,10,14 -tetramethylpentadecane) in BALB/c mice  and explore the molecular \nmechanisms underlying and signaling pathways probably involved . \n \n \nResults and Discussion  \n \n1. Olive secoiridoid Oleuropein  and its semisynthetic acetyl -derivatives reduce LPS -induced \ninflammatory response in murine peritoneal macrophages via JAK -STAT and MAPKs signaling \npathways .  \nThis study was designed to investigate th e potential anti -inflammatory, antioxidant and \nimmunomodulatory activities of three new acyl derivatives synthesized from OL: Per-OL; 2\u2019\u2019, 3\u2019\u2019, 4\u2019\u2019, \n6\u2019\u2019-Tetra -O-acetyloleuropein and 6\u2019\u2019 -O-Acetyloleuropein in LPS -stimulated mouse peritoneal \nmacrophages in comparison with natural OL.  \nOL is the main phenolic component of olives leaves, roots and unprocessed olive drupes which is \nhydrolyzed  and form different products, including  HTy  (Pan et al. , 2018) . The ac etylation of \npolyphenols may bring improved properties to these molecules, such as, improved bioavailability, \ncell membrane penetration and enhanced anti -inflammatory and antioxidant activities among others \n(de Ara\u00fajo et al. , 2017) .  \nBalance disruption of the intracellular reduction -oxidation state has been observed in s timulated \nmacrophages. Our findings showed that the new OL acyl derivatives  were able to reduce reactive \noxygen species (R OS) levels acting as effective antioxidants. The stimulation of macrophages by LPS \ninduces the transcription of iNOS gene and generati on of large amount of nitrites (Li et al. , 2012) . In \nour study, we found that OL and its ac etylated derivatives prevented the NO mediated induction and \nreduced iNOS expression induced by LPS. Ciclooxigenase -2 (COX -2) is essential for the inflammatory \nresponse and is responsible for the overproduction of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) in inflammation   Abstract  \n \n6 \n process. Likewise, PGE 2 modulates a variety of immune processes at sites of inflammation, including \nproduction of proinflammato ry cytokines (Cardeno et al., 2014) . Besides, LPS -stimulated  macrophages \nare closely rel ated to an imbalance of cytokine network. It is well -known that this kind of \ninflammatory process is characterized by an increase of proinflammatory  cytokines, mainly, tumor \nnecrosis factor (TNF )-\u03b1, IL -1\u03b2, IL -6, IL -17 and interferon ( IFN)-\u03b3. According to our results, OL and its \nderivatives  treatments were able to significantly reduce COX -2 protein expression , PGE 2 and \nproinflammatory  cytokines levels in LPS -stimulated macrophages.  \nAdditionally, mitogen -activated protein kinases ( MAPK s) pathway is a critical axis essential for \nboth induction and propagation of the inflammatory LPS -activated macrophages response (Radnai et \nal., 2009) . Moreover, MAPKs are also involved in the activation of janus  kinase -signal transducer and \nactivator of transcription ( JAK/STAT ), an important signaling transduction pathway for the biological \nfunction of many cytokines (Zhu et al. , 2013) . Our results showed that the pre-treatment  with these \nphenolic compounds significantly prevented MAPKs and signal tr ansducer and activator of \ntranscription ( STAT )-3 phosphorylation in LPS -stimulated macrophages.  \nNuclear factor E2 -related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) is a redox -sensitive transcription factor  that binds to \nantioxidant response elements (ARE) located in the promoter regions of many \ndetoxifying/antioxidant genes, including heme oxigenase -1 (HO-1). In inflammatory conditions, HO -\n1 protein expression could b e part of an adaptive response to limit cytoxi city via several mechanisms, \nregulation of cell proliferation and prevention of apoptosis. Thus, Nrf2 regulates redox status and \nplays key roles in cellular defense by enhancing ROS remove (Rosillo et al. , 2015) . Our data showed \nthat OL derivatives were able to increase the protein expression of Nrf2 and HO -1 in LPS -stimulated \nmacrophages.  \nIn conclusion, the new ac etylated OL derivatives have an important role in the balance of the \ninflammatory microenvironment induced by LPS in murine peritoneal macrophages by inhibiting \nproinflammatory  cytokines production, as well as, iNOS and COX -2 overexpression. The mechanisms \nunderlying these protective effects could be related via Nrf2/HO -1 antioxidant pathway activa tion \nand inhibition of both JAK /STAT and MAPKs signaling pathways.  \n \n2. Oleuropein down -regulated IL -1\u03b2-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in human synovial \nfibro blasts cell line SW982 . \n RA is a chronic and systemic in flammatory autoimmune disease mainly characterized by \naggressive hyperproliferation of synovial fibroblasts (SFs).  \n As it is has been commented above, OL possesses well -documented pharmacological properties, \nincluding antioxidant and anti -inflammatory  effects , and  it is available as a food supplement in \nMediterranean countries. However, to date, anti -arthritic e ffects of OL on SFs have not been yet \nelucidated.  \n The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential e ffects of OL, on IL -1\u03b2-induced \nproduction of in flammatory mediators and oxidative stress in the human synovial sarcoma cell line \n(SW982). In order to gain a better insight into  its mechanisms of action, signaling pathways were also \nexplored. O L exerted anti -inflammatory and anti -oxidant e ffects via down -regulation of MAPK s and  \nnuclear transcription factor -kappa B (NF -\u03baB) signaling pathways and induction of Nrf2 -linked HO -1 \ncontrolling the production of in flammatory  mediators decreasing IL -6 and TNF -\u03b1 cytokines, MMP -1   Abstract  \n \n7 \n and MMP -3 levels and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase -1 (mPGEs -1) and COX -2 overexpression. \nThus, OL might provide a basis for developing a new dietary strategy for the  prevention and \nmanagement of RA.  \n \n3. Oleuropein and its new peracetylated derivative am eliorate joint inflammation and destruction in \na murine collagen -induced ar thritis model via activ ation of the Nrf 2/HO -1 antioxidant pat hway \nand suppression of MAPKs and NF -\u03baB activation . \n This study was designed to evaluate dietary OL and Per-OL supplementation effects on CIA \nmodel  in mice . \nThree -weeks -old male DBA -1/J mice were randomized into five experimental groups during all \nexperiment period: (i) Na\u00efve group (SD -Na\u00efve) which received a S tandard Diet (SD) ; (ii) CIA control \ngroup (SD -CIA) which received a SD; (iii) OL diet group enriched 0.05% (OL -CIA); (iv) Per -OL diet \nenriched 0.05% (Per -OL 0.05 -CIA) and (v) Per -OL diet enriched 0.025% (Per -OL 0.025 -CIA). After six \nweeks, arthritis was induced by type II collagen  (CII) (day 0) and on day 21, mice received a booster \ninjection. Mice were sacrificed 42 days after first immunization. Blood was recollected and paws were \nhistological and biochemically processed.   \nOur data revealed, that OL and Per -OL supplemented diets exhibited preventive effec ts in the \ndevelopment of inflammation and joint damage in SD -CIA in comparison with animals that were fed \nwith OL and Per -OL enriched -diets. These results were correlated to an improve arthritis score and \nwith a reduction of inflammatory cells infiltration  into articular tissue, synovial hyperplasia and \ncartilage destruction.  \nCartilage oligomeric matrix protein ( COMP ) is non -collagenous component of cartilage with a \ngreat potential as a biological marker of cartilage metabolism in RA (Rosillo et al. , 2016b) . Also, MMP -\n3 has been reported to be the major enzymes produced by fibroblasts and macrophages in the \nsynovium and it is responsible for the d egradation of proteoglycans, cartilage link protein, fibronectin \nand collagen (Castej\u00f3n et al., 2017) . \n Our results showed that the levels of both parameters, COMP and MMP -3 were significantly \nlowered with dietary OL and Per -OL treatment in CIA mice.  In this study, we have demonstrated that \nOL and Per -OL enriched -diets could be able to control the local levels of  proinflammatory  cytokines, \nsuch as IL -6, IL -1\u03b2, IL -17, TNF -\u03b1 and IFN -\u03b3, which were associated with the progression of RA \n(Komatsu and Takayanagi, 2012) . Besides, the increment of proinflammatory  mediators, like COX -2 \nand iNOS protein expression could contribute to the progression of RA (Zhao et al. , 2019) . However, \nthe expression of both biomarkers was sign ificantly inhibited by dietary OL and Per -OL treatment.  \nAbnormal signaling pathways play an important role in the inflammatory process and can lead to \na dysregulation of the inflammatory response being crucial in RA pathogenesis. On one hand, MAPKs \nplay i mportant roles in transducing synovial inflammation and joint destruction and they are \nconsidered critical molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in RA (Thalhamer, McGrath and \nHarnett, 2007) . Besides, NF -\u03baB is considered a key signaling molecule in the control of synovial \ninflammation, hyperplasia and ma trix generation playing an important role in the development of RA \n(Chen et al. , 2016) . Our results suggested th at dietary OL and Per -OL treatments suppressed NF -\u03baB \nactivation and MAPKs phosphorylation  in CIA -induced arthritis mice. On the other hand, the \nactivation of Nrf2/HO -1 signaling pathway plays a critical role in the prevention and relief of RA   Abstract  \n \n8 \n (Fan et al. , 2018)  since  Nrf2 inhibition aggravates cartilage destruction and accelerates the effector \nphase of RA in mice. However, upregulating the expression of Nrf2 exerts anti -inflammatory effects \nin RA (Wu et al. , 2016) . Our data showed that HO -1 and Nrf2 protein expression were decreased in \nSD-CIA control group, however dietary Per -OL treatments could restore Nrf2 and HO -1 expressions.  \nOL and Per -OL dietary treatments improved the oxidative events due to Nrf2/HO -1 activation \nand returned proinflammatory  proteins expression to basal levels probably  blocking MAPKs and NF -\n\u03baB pathways. Therefore, OL and Per -OL supplements might provide a basis for developing a new \ndietary strategy for the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis.  \n \n4. Oleuropein  and its new acetyl derivative dietary treatments modulate inflammatory response in \nperitoneal macrophages from pristane -induced SLE mice via regulation of canonical and non -\ncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome . \nThe present study was designed to evaluate the potential effects of OL and Per -OL dietary \ntreatments on peritoneal macrophages from pristane -induced mice and clarify the mediators and \nmolecular mechanisms involved. Murine macrophages were collected after t he sacrificed  of mice for \nfurther experimental assays.  \nOur data showed that OL and Per -OL enriched -diets produced a considerable reduction of \ninflammatory dama ge in kidneys tissues. Whereas p ristane injection induced an increment of levels of \nproinflammat ory cytokines, this increase was effectively prevented after OL and Per -OL dietary \ntreatments. It is has been reported that IL -1\u03b2 can promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of \nother cells via activating STAT3. Besides, STAT3 play a crucial role in the Th17 generation and up -\nregulation of STAT3/IL17 expression had been described in lupus patients. Additionally, in a \nprevious study the reduction of Th1 and Th17 cytokines levels was accompanied by a pSTAT3 down -\nregulation in LPS -stimulated macrophag es from OL and Per -OL treated SLE mice (Chen et al. , 2019) .  \n Furthermore, an increment of COX -2 and iNOS protein expression was found in LPS -stimulated \nperitoneal macrophages from SD -SLE mice in comparison with SD -sham control mice. Both \nbiomarkers pro tein expression were reduced after OL and Per -OL enriched -diets treatments.  \nAdditionally, NF -\u03baB system induce d the expression of various pro inflammatory genes, including \nthose encoding cytokines and chemokines such as TNF -\u03b1, IL -1\u03b2, IL -6, iNOS, COX -2 and al so \nparticipates in the regulation and development of inflammation disease (Liu et al. , 2017) . Our studies \nrevealed that dietary OL and Per -OL treatments produced a significantly down -regulation of both \nsignaling pathways in murine macrophages isolated from SLE treated mice.  \nInflammasome machinery is dysregulated in SLE and plays an important rol e in promotion of \norgan damage. Maturation and secretion of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 translation are mediated by \ninflammasome activated caspase -1 (Shirato et al. , 2017)  and also, non-canonical inflammasome, there \nis an alternative via which has been described to activate caspase -11, and also serve as an additional \npathway of maturation and secretion of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 in  macrophage -mediate immune response  \n(Kayagaki et al. , 2011) . Our results showed that OL and Per -OL dietary treatments inhibited canonical \nand non -canonical activation of NLR family pyrin domain -containing 3 ( NLRP3 ) inflammasome/IL -\n1\u03b2 in murine peritoneal macrophages isolated from pristane -SLE mice.    Abstract  \n \n9 \n  Taken all together, OL and Per -OL exerted a protective effect against inflammatory lupic \nresponse in murine peritoneal macrophages from pristane -SLE mice via STAT3  and NF -\u03baB signaling \nexpression coupled with inhibition of canonical and non -canonical NLRP3 inflammasome.  \n \n5. Dietary Oleuropein and its new acetyl derivative, attenuate murine lupus nephritis through HO -\n1/Nrf2 activation and suppressing JAK -STAT, NF -\u03baB and  NLRP3 inflammasome signaling \npathways . \nIn this study, we evaluated the effects of dietary OL and its new derivate, Per -OL, in a pristane -\ninduced SLE model.  \nThree -months -old mice were randomized into four experimental groups: (i) Sham group were fed \nwith SD (SD -Sham); (ii) pristane group received SD (SD -SLE); (iii) pristane OL group were fed with \nSD supplemented with OL and (iv) pristane Per -OL group were fed with SD supplemented with Per -\nOL. SLE model was induced and performed by the procedure previously described by Satoh et al. \n(Satoh and Reeves, 1994) . Mice received an injection of pristane or saline solution and were fed with \nexperimental diets: enriched with OL and Per -OL.  \nOur results showed that OL and Per -OL enriched -diets decreased renal abnormalities and renal \ninterstitial fibrosis in comparison with SD -SLE control group. It is well -known that lupus nephritis \nand its progression might depend on the disintegration of the membrane due to the effects of MMPs \nactivities. Besides, pristane -induced SLE is characterized by an increasing of iNOS expression in \nkidneys (Botte et al. , 2014) , and also mPGEs -1 and PGE 2 play an important role in inflammatory \nkidney injury (Lazarus et al. , 2001; Suganami et al. , 2003) . Our findings showed a significantly \nreduction of MMP -3 and PGE 2 levels and mPGEs -1 protein expression in OL and Per -OL groups \ncompared with pristane control group.  \nTo recognize whether up -regulation of Nrf2 -dependent signaling by OL and Per -OL \nsupplemented diets could diminish renal inflammation in pristane -induced kidney damage, we \nmeasured Nrf2 and HO -1 protein expression and we have observed a significantly increm ent of Nrf2 \nin comparison with pristane control group in mice which were fed with OL enriched diets, while a \nsignificantly up -regulation of both proteins were detected in Per -OL supplemented diet.   \nTo have to delve in the study of mechanisms underlying in the effects of OL and Per -OL diets in \nSLE model, we observed a markedly increment of p -STAT3 expression in SD -SLE group compared \nwith SD -sham group but this was significantly down -regulated with OL and Per -OL diets. Also, we \nobserved an important degradati on of inhibitory protein (I\u03baB-\u03b1) in kidney in pristane group mice, but \nPer-OL diet was able to prevent its degradation after pristane injection. On the other hand, NF -\u03baB-p65 \ntranslocation into the nucleus was remarkably increased after pristane injection w hereas OL and Per -\nOL supplemented diets were able to prevent the nuclear migration. Besides, an increment of p38, \njanus NH 2-terminal kinase ( JNK) and extracellular signal -regulated kinase ( ERK 1/2) phosphorylation \noccur after pristane injection but OL and P er-OL enriched -diets could prevent MAPKs \nphosphorylation.  \nInflammasome complex is dysregulated in SLE, playing an important role in promotion of org an \ndamage and development of lupus pathologies (Kahlenberg and Kaplan, 2014) . Our data showed that   Abstract  \n \n10 \n OL and Per -OL enriched -diets could inhibit the canonical and non -canonical NLRP3 inflammasome \nsignaling pathways.  \nIn summary, dietary OL and Per -OL supplementation reduced kidney damage and \nproinflammatory  cytokines levels in kidneys from pristane -induced mice, and showed a remarkable \nblockage of JAK/ STAT, MAPKs and NF -\u03baB pathways, showing that OL and Per -OL may offer a new \npromising strategy to improve different immune -inflammatory markers o n this SLE model.  \n \nConclusion  \nAltogether, our results suggest that OL and Per-OL exert  significant anti-inflammatory and \nimmunomodulatory effects on in vitro , ex vivo , and in vivo  (RA and SLE ) immunoinflammatory \nexperimental models . The mechanisms underlying these protective effects could  be related to the \nregulation of B cell responses, activation of the Nrf2/HO -1 signaling and the inhibition of relevant  \nsignaling pathways such as JAK/ STAT, MAPKs and NF -\u03baB coupled with inhibition of  canonical and \nnon-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome, thus controlling the production of inflammatory mediators \nincluding  Th1 cytokines and PGE 2 \nHenc e, OL and its acetyl -derivative might provide  a basis for potential nutraceutical \ncomplements  offering a new promising therapeutic str ategy in the management of immune -\ninflammatory diseases  just like  RA and SLE.  Nevertheless, to validate our preclinical obtained results, \nintervention nutritional studies are  guaranteed.  \n \nReferences  \n\uf0b7 Aparicio -Soto, M. et al.

Mainly, secoiridoids have shown large variety  of \npharmacological effects including anti -diabetic, anti -inflammatory, immuno modulatory, , \nneuroprotective, anti -cancer and anti -obesity, which increase the interest of studying these types of \ncompounds in depth. These compounds are thoroughly distributed in several families of plants \nincluding Oleaceae, Valerianaceae, Gentianaceae, among others . Particularly , Olea europaea L. \n(Oleaceae) is rich in biophenol secoiridoids such as oleuropein (OL), dimethyl -OL, ligstroside, and \nits hydrolysis derivatives including  OL-aglycone, elenolate, oleoside -11-methyl ester, elenoic acid, \nhydroxytyrosol (HTy) a nd tyrosol (Ty ).

In fact , the antioxidant, anti -inflammatory and immunomodulatory propert ies \nof secoiridoids from olive tree  (Olea europaea  L. (Oleaceae))  have been suggested as a potential \napplication in several immuno -inflammatory diseases. There is evidence indicating that \nsecoiridoids from olive tree has potential as a therapy for a  wide v ariety of chronic autoimmune  \ndiseases such as rheumatoid arthritis ( RA), systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE), inflammatory \nbowel disease ( IBD), diabetes type 1  (T1DM ) and multiple  sclerosis  (MS) .

INTRODUCTION  \n \nIridoids and secoiridoids  include a wide group of monoterpenes present in plants and insects, \nwhich have beneficial health properties. The name iridoid derived from Iridomyrmex , a genus of \nfornices from which iridomirmecin and iridodial compounds were isolated. These products have  \nbeen considered as defensive compounds. The biosynthesis of these compounds takes place in the \ndifferent organisms by similar pathways, being the defense its main role, or in the case of insects, \nused as sex pheromones (Boros Christie, Stermitz, 1990) .  \nIridoids were first isolated in the latter part of ninete enth century, but it was not until 1958 that \nHalpern and Schmid proposed the basic skeleton of the iridoids in their investigation of the \nstructure of plumieride (El-Naggar and Beal, 1980) . Particularly, the y are secondary metabolites of \nterrestrial and marine flora and fauna and are found in a large number of plants families usually as \nglycosides. For this reason, some of them are chemotaxonomically useful as markers of genus in \nvarious plant families (Dinda, Debnath and Harigaya, 2007) . \n \nIridoids can have open structures (secoiridoids) or closed structures (really iridoids) and they \nappear usually as heteroside compounds, in particular as glycosides. In addition they have \ndemonstrated anti -inflammatory, antibacterial, anti -carcinogenic and antiviral activity, and they \ncan be used as antidote in mushroom intoxications by Amanita  type (L\u00f3pez Carre ras, Miguel and \nAleixandre, 2012) . Mainly, secoiridoids have shown a variety pharmacological effects including \nanti-diabetic, anti -inflammatory, immunosuppressive, neuroprotective, anti -cancer and anti -\nobesity, which increases the interest of studying t hese types of compounds in depth (Huang et al. , \n2019) . \nThis kind of natural compounds included ten carbo n atoms in their structure, so they belong to \nthe monoterpenes group. They have acyclopena -[c]-pyrane skeleton, also known as 2 -oxabicyclo -\n[4,3,0] -nonane. When they present a cleavage of cyclopentane ring is known as secoiridoids, while \nif the cleavage is of pyran ring produces iridoid derivatives. Hence, the ring of cyclopentane is \nconsidered as basic skeletal ring of iridoids (Dinda, Debnath and Harigaya, 2007) . \nThe study of biological and pharmacological activities of iridoids and secoiridioids has \nrevealed that both exhibit an extensive variety of bioactivities, and they are used as bitter tonics, \nsedatives, antipyretics, and cough drugs, remedies for skin disorders and as hypotensive.  So, this \nfact encouraged to investigate the bio -activities of these phytochemicals (Dinda, Debnath and \nHarigaya, 2007) . \n \n1.1. Structure and classification    Introduction  \n \n20 \n  \nGiven the variety and complexity of this group of molecules, there are several ways of \nclassifying iridoids and secoiridoids that have developed over the years.  \nAccording to Hegnauer, iridoids have distributed in three large groups: non -glycosides, \nglycosi des and secoiridoids (Hegnauer and K ooiman, 1978) . Non -glycosides and glycosides could \nhave traces of sugars in their structures, so it is their main differential feature. In the other hand, \nsecoiridoids derive from the rupture of the C 7-C8 and, in turn, they are subdivided into four larg e \ngroups:  \n\uf0b7 Molecules, which structure derives from sweroside and morroniside  \n\uf0b7 Molecules, which their structure is type of oleoside  \n\uf0b7 Alcaloids, which included pseudoalcaloids and complex alcaloids  \n\uf0b7 Hydrangesides  \n \nIn 1975, Sticher and Junod (Sticher and Junod -Busch, 1975)  proposed a new classification of \niridoi ds in five large groups:  \n\uf0b7 Methylciclopentanoids: iridoids with a simple structure  \n\uf0b7 Iridoids with a complex pattern of oxidation and they could be glucosides or non -glucosides if they \nhave a molecule of glucose in their structure or not  \n\uf0b7 Secoiridoids  \n\uf0b7 Monoterpe nalcaloids  \n\uf0b7 Alcaloids with an irioid rest in their structure  \n \nFrom 1980 to date, the bibliographical reviews that order the recently discovered structrures, \nuse the classification proposed by El -Naggar and Beal (El-Naggar and Beal, 1980) , which groups \nthese compounds according to the number of carbons included in their structure; thus, the first two \ngroups correspond to nor -iridoids:  \n \n\uf0b7 The group 1  is poor numerous and included C 8 iridoids (di -nor-iridoids).  \n\uf0b7  \n\uf0b7 The group 2  integrated C 9 iridoids (nor -iridoids) and it separated in two another groups:  \n2.1. Iridoids derivated from loss of C 10. \n2.2. This group is the most numerous, and they included iri doids derivated from loss of \nC11.  \n\uf0b7 The group 3 , the most commonly in the nature, is C 10. It included a sugar residue, normally glucose. \nThese compounds are separated in four subgroups:  \n       3.1. Compounds with a sugar residue in C 1.   Introduction  \n \n21 \n  3.2. Compounds with a sugar residue in other position in the molecule.  \n 3.3. Iridoids type Valeriana.  \n 3.4. Iridoids type Plumeria.  \n \n\uf0b7 The group 4 , included aglycones and some iridoids included in the other three groups but without \na sugar residue in their structure.  \n \n\uf0b7 The group 5 , included a iridoids derivatives. It group included compounds derived from the \nopening of the pyran ring. It group included two another subgroups:  \n 5.1. Compounds C 10 in which pyran ring is opened though the rupture of O 2-C3 bond.  \n 5.2. Compounds C 9 bicyclic which are derived from the O 2-C3 bond rupture, and with a \nloss of C 11 and after that, a cyclisation of the C 3-C4 chain to form a furan ring.  \n \n\uf0b7 The group 6 , included bis -iridoids  like a result of condensation of two monomers, probably with \ndirect form or through a sugar residue.  \n \nAt the same time, due to the wide range that these kinds of compounds, there are other \nclassifications of secoiridoids according to the presence of these  compounds in certain families \nincluding Oleaceae family. In fact, a total of 232 secoiridoids (glycosides, aglycones, derivatives and \ndimers) have been isolated from 9 genus of the family Oleaceae. These genera include Fontanesia, \nFraxinus, Jasminum, Ligu strum, Olea, Osmanthus, Phillyrea, Picconia and Syringa  and the secoiridoids \nwere classified into 5 groups (Huang et al. , 2019) : \no Simple secoiridoids  \nGenerally, for the simple secoiridoids, positions C 7 and C 11 have either a free carboxylic \nacid group or a methyl ethyl ester derivative of the acid.  \n \no Conjugated secoiridoids  \nThis group of compounds constitutes the majority of secoiridoids isolated from \nthe Oleaceae  family. The name of the class stems from the type of compound that is linked \nor conjugated to the secoiridoid nucleus. Based on this, the class is further into seve n \nsubgroups: aromatic -conjugated, sugar -conjugated, terpene -conjugated, cyclopentane -\nconjugated, coumarin -conjugated, lignans -conjugated and others secoiridoids. Normally, \nthe conjugations occur in C 7 because this position is usually oxidized to a carboxyl ic acid \nand esterified with different groups.  \n \no 10-Oxyderivative of oleoside secoiridoids    Introduction  \n \n22 \n This group possesses the oleoside nucleus with distinct structural differences. The C 8 and \nC9 positions exist as double bonds or an ester is formed by an oxygen atom w ith different \ngroups. A total of 40 compounds from this group have been isolated from Oleacea e family.  \n \no Z-Secoiridoids  \nThese compounds present double bond geometry at the C 8 in Z -configuration, for this, \nonly a few compounds isolated from Oleaceae are incl uded in it.  \n \no Secologanosides and oxidized secologanoside secoiridoids  \nThe most of compounds in this class are based on the secologanoside  nucleus. The special \nstructure features of these compounds are the positions on the carbon -carbon double bond \nbetween C 8 and C 10 and the level oxidation of C 10. \n \n1.2. Main representants  \n \nThese compounds are thoroughly distributed in plants of class Magnoliopside, concretely \nof the families Scropulariaceae, Verbenaceae, Lamiaceae, Apocynaceae, Loganiaceae, Bignoniaceae, \nPlantaginaceae, Rubiaceae, Pedaliaceae, Cornaceae, Acantheceae, Loasaceae, Lentibulariaceae, \nGentianaceae, Oleaceae, Nyctanthaceae, C aprifoliaceae, Dispsacaceae and Valerianaceae.  \nBesides, there are plants, which are commonly used in medicine, whose pharmacological \nactivity is due to these irioids, for example, Valeriana officinalis  L. (Valerianaceae), Olea europaea  L. \n(Oleaceae), Harpa gophytum procumbens  L. (Pedaliaceae), Genciana lutea  L. (Gentianaceae), Fraxinus \nexcelsior  L. (Oleaceae) (Dinda, Debnath and Harigaya, 2007) . \n \n\uf0b7 Valeriana officinalis  L. (Valerianaceae)  \n \nPlants of family of Valerianaceae such as Valeriana officinalis  L. or Valeriana jatamansi  L. \npresent in their composition an acylic isoprenoid monoterpene called geraniol. It could be isolated \nfrom the essential oils of these kinds of aromatic plants (Lei et al. , 2019) . Geranoil  could be \nconsidered a precursor of bicyclic monoterpenes which are name iridoids (L\u00f3pez Carreras, Miguel \nand Aleixandre, 2012) . The potential application of geraniol is based on its pharmacological \nproperti es, including antitumor and cytotoxic activities in different types of cancer (Lei et al. , 2019) , \nanti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities in several inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative \ncolitis (UC) (Medicherla et al. , 2015)  as well as antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans  (Singh, \nFatima and Hameed , 2016) , among others.  \nBesides their essential oils, the chemical composition of Valeriana  sp. mainly focused on \nmonoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, lignans, flavonoids, alkaloids, etc. Iridoids are the main   Introduction  \n \n23 \n chemical components of monoterpenoids. The Valeriana  plants have been draw much attention for \ntheir significant sedation, spasmolysis, antidepression, antitumor, against adenosine A1 receptors \nand cytoxicity activity and had certain function for cardiovascular diseases treatment (Wang et al. , \n2016) .  \n \n\uf0b7 Harpagophytum procumbens  L. (Pedaliaceae)  \n \nHarpagophytum procumbens  L. is an herbaceous plant, which has been long used in the \nforms of infusions, decoctions, tinctures, powders and extracts. Its main components are rich in \niridoids glycosides such as harpagoside, harpagide and procumbide which are present in plants \ntuber s (Menghini et al. , 2019) . Also, other components which could be found in this plan ts are \nsugars, triterpenoids (mainly oleanolic and ursolic acid), phytosterols (primarly \u03b2 -sitosterol), \naromatic acid (caffeic, cinnamic and chlorogenic acid) and flavonoids (lutoelin and kaemferol).  \nIn others studies has been demonstrated the potential r ole of Harpagophytum procumens  L. \nin the management of different inflammatory and stress oxidative pathologies such as: rheumatoid \narthritis (RA), osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), low -back pain, diabetes and \nneurodegeneration.   \n \n\uf0b7 Getiana lutea  L. (Gentiaceae)  \n \nPhytochemicals of the Gentinaceae family includes a wide spectrum of compounds with \nvarious chemical structures. Most common are iridoids, flavonoids and xanthones . There are \nseveral studies that confirm the potential of some gentians plants for the production of bioactive \ncompounds and validate the ethnomedical use of these species as remedies for the treatment of \ngastric disorders (lypoacidity) (Yang, Liu and  Shi, 2010) . Secoiridoidal glycosides are the most \nimportant bitter constituents, belonging to Gentiana  genus. Gentiopicroside, amatogentin are the \nsecoiridoids isolated from Gentiana lutea \u2019s root (Aberham et al. , 2011) . Secoiridoidal glycosides \nisolated from different Gentiana  species have several important activities, for example, amarogentin \nand amaroswerin have the strongest gastro protective effects among the other secoiridoidals (Niiho \net al. , 2006) . Gentiopicrin and xanthone isogentisin, extracted from leaves and flowers of Gentiana \nlutea  L. have considerable antimicrobial activities (\u0160avikin et al. , 2009) . Moreover, phytochemical \nstudies on Gentiana  sp. led to the discovery of other compounds such as xanthones, polyphenols \nand flavones which are b eside secoiridoids responsible for cholinesterase inhibitory, antioxidant, \nantitumor and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) proliferation inhibitory activities (Isakovic et \nal., 2008; Senol et al. , 2012; Waltenberger et al. , 2015) .  \n \n\uf0b7 Fraxinus excelsior  L. (Olaceae)    Introduction  \n \n24 \n  \nFraxinus , is a member of the Olaceae  family, which chemical constituents of Fraxinus plant \ninclude various secoiridoids, phenylethanoids, flavonoids, coumarius and lignans; therefore, it is \nconsidered as a plant with versatile biological and pharmacological activities (Sarfraz et al. , 2017) . \nMetabolites and extracts from these types of plants have been found to possess variety of biological \nactivities such as anticancer, anti -inflammatory, antioxidative, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, \nantiallergic, skin regenerating and diuretic (Kostova and Iossifova, 2007) .  \nIn fact, Fraxinus rhynchophylla C  presents a high amount of beneficial compounds such as  \nhydroxyframoside B 2\u201d -hydroxyoleuropein , oleuropein (OL) , ligstroside, syringing and e sculitin \nwhich have reported different properties such as pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity, inhibitor of \nadypocite differentiation in 3T3 -L1 cells, neuroprotective, antidyslipidemia, renoprotective, \nantioxidant and hepatoprotective (Jiang et al. , 2008; Tien et al. , 2011; Ahn et al. , 2013; Kim et al. , \n2018) . \nThe specie Fraxinus  excelsior  L. , presents in its seeds active compounds like nuzhenide, \nligstroside, oleoside 11 -methyl ester, oleoside dimethyl ester, among others, which have beneficial \nproperties such as antihypertensive, antihypertrigliceridemia, antirheumatic, anti -inflammatory \nand antidiabetic (von Kruedene r, Schneider and Elstner, 1995; Maghrani et al. , 2004; Mont\u00f3 et al. , \n2014) . \n \n\uf0b7 Olea europaea L. (Olaceae)  \n \nOleaceae  is a family of dicotyledonous flowering plants which is widely distributed in the \ntemperate and tropical regions. This family includes 25 genera with approximately 688 species. \nPhytochemical studies have demonstrated that the main chemical constituents fr om this family are \nflavonoids, monoterpenoids, iridoids, secoiridoids and phenylethanoid glycosides (Huang et al. , \n2019) . The leaves of Olea europaea  L. are used in Greece for lowering blood pressure (Lawrendiadis, \n1961) . In the Peninsula Sorrentina (Southern Italy), essential oil extracted from Olea europaea  L. is \nused to treat rheumatism and promote blood circulation (De Feo et al. , 1992) . In the northern and \ncentral Oman (Arabia) essential oil extracted from the fruit of Olea europaea  L. is used as a laxative \n(Ghazanfar and Al -Al-Sabahi, 1993) .  \nOur main interest focuses on the study of the secoiridoids that mainly found in family \nOleaceae , due to our extensive experience in the study of beneficial effects of the olive tree and extra \nvirgin olive oil (EVOO) , as well as its different components in the prevention and treatment of \ndiverse autoimmune diseases (C\u00e1rdeno, S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo and Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra, 2013; \nAparicio -Soto et al. , 2016; Rosillo, Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra and  S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo, 2016) . Besides, there \nseveral studies which have proved the beneficial effects of EVOO and also, its phenolic   Introduction  \n \n25 \n components, such as hydroxytyrosol (HTy) in the reduction of the inflammatory pathway and in \nthe prevention of cardiovascular  diseases (Perrone et al. , 2019) .    \nOlea europaea  L. (Oleaceae ) is a small evergreen tree with hoary, rigid branches and a \ngrayish bark. The leaves are opposite, lanceolate, mucronate, shortpetioled, green above, and hoary \non the underside. For other hand, the flowers are small, in short, axillary, erect racemes, ver y much \nshorter than the leaves, and the fruit is a small drup, smooth, purple or green, with a nauseous, \nbitter flesh, enclosing a sharp -pointed stone (Ghanbari et al. , 2012) . Olea europaea L. preparations \nhave been traditional used in folk medicine in European Mediterranean area, Arab ia peninsula, \nIndia and other tropical and subtropical regions, as a diuretic, emollient, hypotensive and for \nurinary and bladder infections (Somova et al. , 2003) .  \nMost of the plants parts of Olea europaea  L. are used in traditional system of medicine in \nworld. Oil is taken with lemon juice to tre at galls stones (Sheth, 2005) . Leaves are taken orally  for \nstomach and intestinal diseases and used as mouth cleanser (Bellakhdar et al. , 1991) . Decoction of \ndried leaves is taken orally for diabetes (Alarcon -Aguilara et al. , 1998) . Besides, an extract of the \nfresh leaves is taken orally to treat hypertension and to induce diuresis (De A . Ribeiro et al. , 1986)  \nand the infusion of the fresh leaf is taken orally for as an alternative treatment for inflammatory \ndiseases (Pieroni et al. , 1996) . Besides, the green olive drups are rich in biophenol secoiridoids such \nas OL, dimethyl -OL, ligstroside, and their hydroly sis derivatives such as OL aglycone, elenolate, \noleoside -11-methyl ester, elenoic acid, HTy  and tyrosol (Ty) (Figure 1).  \n \n   Introduction  \n \n26 \n  \n \n \nIn conclusion, there are a lot of plants which have been used as medicines since the time of \nimmemorial, concretely Olea europaea L. is a specie rich in compounds which have proved their \nefficacy in the management of various complex diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular \ndisorders, viral and microbial infections but still a lot of work is to be done for exploring the \nevidences for other traditional uses of the plant.  \n \n \n1.3. Biosynthesis and biotransformation of secoiridoids in olive tree  \n \nAmount and distribution of secoiridoids in olive tissues depend of various environmental \nfactors as ripening cycle, geographical origin, a nd cultivation practices, among others. Besides of \nthis, the content of phenolic glycosides as patterns and the activity of endogenous enzymes can \nplay a role in the quantitative composition of secoiridoids in olive (Termentzi, Halabalaki and \nSkaltsounis, 2015) . \nThe fact that secoiridoids  are mostly present in early stages is due to enzymatic and chemistry \nreactions in the maturation time. It has been described three different states in maturation of fruit: \n  Introduction  \n \n27 \n growth phase, green maturation phase and black maturation phase, which is character ized by \npresence of anthocyans.  \nOL is mainly abundant in early stages, although their levels following decrease during \nmaturation. In black crops, OL decreases quickly. For this reason, some varieties of Oleaceae  not \npresent this secoiridoid in black frui ts. \nThe main precursor of OL and ligstroside is oleoside 11 -methyl ester (elenolic acid glucoside). \nFirstly, geraniol synthase (GES) catalyses the transformation of genaryl diphosphate to geraniol, \nthat is converted to 10 -hydroxygeraniol by geraniol 10 -hydroxylase enzyme (GE10H). The iridioids \nin Oleaceae must be formed from this point, with 10 -hydroxygeraniol as the starting compound, \nvia irididal and iridotrial up to the deoxyloganic acid, which is the known precursor of loganin and \nloganic acid, secologa nin and secologanic acid (Perez -Martinez et al. , 2007) . From this point, it has \nbeen proposed up to five routes to explain the origin of all iridoids found in this family. However,  \nit known that in Olea europaea L.  most of secoiridoids derived from deoxyloganic acid as common \nintermediate (Rosendal Jensen, Franzyk and Wallander, 2002; Perez -Martinez et al. , 2007) . \nFollowing this line, NADH deshydrogenase acts on 10 -hydroxygeraniol to form deoxyloganic acid \nalgucone. Transfer of glucosyl groups to deoxyloganic acid aglucone (precursor of monot erpene \nindolic alcaloids and OL  is catalysed by glucosyltransferase (GT). Deoxyloganic acid experiments a \n7-\u03b1-hydroxylation of cyclopentane ri ng and forms 7 -epiloganic acid, that quickly goes to 7 -\nketologanic acid trough hydroxy l group oxidation by NHDI. Loganic acid methyltransferase \ncatalyse 7 -ketologanin syntheses. In this point, secologanin synthase (SLS) oxides ketonic group to \nform 11 -methyl oleoside that immediately is glusylated by GT. Finally, 7 -\u03b2-1-D-glucopyranosyl -11-\nmethyl oleos ide is esterified with Ty  to produce ligstroside and then, OL is formed (Perez -Martinez \net al. , 2007; Obied et al. , 2008) .  \nSecoiridoids are distributed all most tissues of the olive tree, but their nature and concentration \nchange between different parts of the plant. Data from literature concerning that biosynthetic or \nmechanicals transformation through the production are de terminatives to quantitative alterations \nof the bioactive small molecules (Rosendal Jensen, Franzyk and Wallander, 2002) .  OL is the major \nsecoiridoid constituent  of unripe drupes (peel, pulp and seed). The amount of OL decreases with \nmaturation of fruit, and it turn; its aglycon form goes to increasing their levels. OL -aglycone is \nformed by the cleavage of the glycosidic bond du e to \u03b2 -glucosidades activity . Ligust roside have \nbeen described as a common phenolic component in different olive tissues (leaf, fruit pulp, stone) \nand olive oil, but it has been rarely found in olive seeds (Maestri et al. , 2019) . \nIn the course of maturation, OL and ligustroside are considered pattern components. Both of \nthem are present in olive fruit but they are almost non -existent in the olive oil (85 -95% reduction) \n(Go\u0301mez-Rico et al. , 2009; Kanakis et al. , 2013) . \u03b2-glucosydases act decreasing the levels of OL and \nligustroside while their by -products increase. Aglycon forms from OL and ligustroside can be   Introduction  \n \n28 \n detected as isomers. It is due to the keto -enolic tautomeric equilibrium of the elenolic acid moiety \n(Caruso et al. , 2000; Obied et al. , 2007) .  \nOther dialdehydic structurally related with these secoiridoid precursors are olacein and \noleocanthal. Different authors have reported that both olacein and oleocanthal levels increase \nduring ripening due to degradation of OL and ligustroside, respectively (Gutierrez -Rosales et al. , \n2010) . So, they conclude that OL and ligustroside are natural precursors of olacein and oleocanthal \nas breakdown products r esulting from enzymatic activity during extraction process and maturation \n(Servili et al. , 1999; Ryan et al. , 2002; Danielle   Ryan et al. , 2003; Savarese, Demarco and Sacchi, 2007) . \nOL and ligustroside have been detected in leaves of olive, but not theirs by -products. On the \ncontrary, olacein and oleocanthal  levels were augmented in mature fruits, such as the aglycon \nforms from OL and ligustroside. Nevertheless, such olacein as OL aglycon were more plentiful that \noleocanthal and ligustroside aglycon in olive oil (Termentzi, Halabalaki and Skaltsounis, 2015) . \n \n2. BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF SECOIRIDOIDS  \n \n2.1. Oleuropein  (OL)  \n \nAmong the different components which are already known in the olive plant, the first one \nis the OL,  the most important component of the glucosidic fraction of the Olea europaea  from the \nquantitative point of view and from the historical point of view (Bianco and Ramunno, 2006) . This \ncompound is responsible for the bitter taste of the fruits and the leav es of olive plant. Its structure is \na secoiridoid glucoside that esterifies a dihydroxy -phenyl -ethyl alcohol. OL may play a role in the \nprevention of cardiovascular diseases (Visioli and Galli, 1994) . Besides, OL has been reported to \ndirectly stimulate macrophage activation in laboratory studies (Visioli, Bellosta and Galli, 1998) . \nThe active constituent was reported to be OL, with a propos ed mechanism of action of potentiation \nof glucose -induced insulin release, and an increase in peripheral blood glucose uptake (Gonzalez et \nal., 1992; Bennani -Kabchi et al. , 1999) . Recently, it has been demonstrated that OL was able to \nimprove postpr andial glycaemic profile in healthy subjects (Carnevale et al. , 2018) . \nThe antioxidant effect of OL is exerted through different mechanisms, including its ability \nto improve radical stability th rough the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the \nfree hydrogen of the hydroxyl group and its phenoxyl radicals. OL also has a protective effect in \ncounteracting low -density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, both in vitro , inhibiting in a dose -dependent \nmanner, LDL copper -induced oxidation (Visioli and Galli, 1994; Visioli et al. , 1995) , and in vivo , \nreducing plasmatic levels of total, free and ester cholesterol in rabbits (Coni et al. , 2000) . Besides, OL \nhas also the ability to scavenge nitric oxide (NO); in addition , it also promotes the expression of the \ninducible nitric oxide synthse (iNOS) in cells (De la Puerta et al. 2001) . Some previous studies have \nbeen demonstrated that OL have anti -inflammatory effects by lipoxygenase activity, production of   Introduction  \n \n29 \n leukotriene B4 (De La Puerta et al. , 1999) , inhibiting biosynthesis of pro -inflammatory cytokines or \nmodulating inflammatory parameters. For example, OL was able to reduce significantly tumo r \nnecrosis factor ( TNF )-\u03b1, interleukin ( IL)-1\u03b2 and NO levels in a mouse model of carrageenan -\ninduced pleurisy (Impellizzeri et al. , 2011) . Also, it have been demonstra ted that OL treatment was \ncapable to attenuate the expression of TNF -\u03b1 and IL -1\u03b2 and consequently, the expression of \nciclooxigenase 2 ( COX -2) and iNOS (Khalatbary and Zarrinjoei, 2012) . \nOL is endowed also with antithrombotic and anti -atherogenic  properties which is \ndependent of its anti -inflammatory and antioxidant activities. OL has a beneficial effect on some \ncardiovascular disease via its vasodilatory, anti -platelet aggregation, anti -ischemic and hypotensive \nproperties (Andreadou et al. , 2006; Omar, 2010; Bulotta et al. , 2014) . \nAlso, OL has been reported to modulate several oncogenic signaling pathways. Both in \nvivo and in vitro  studies have demonstrated its anti -cancer potentials (Chimento et al. , 2014; Hassan \net al. , 2014; Yao et al. , 2014; Yan et al. , 2015; Xu and Xiao, 2017) . The consumptions of EVOO is \ninversely correlated with the incidence of some forms of cancer (Barbaro et al. , 2014 ). The beneficial \neffects of olive oil may in part be attributable to the ability of polyphenolic compounds to induce \nepigenetic modulation and altered miRNA expression. Inside the minor component of olive oil and \nolives, OL has been described as the on e responsible for the major anti -tumor activity (Hamdi and \nCastellon, 2005) . In fact, there are several previous studies which described the benef icial effects of \nOL treatment in the prevention of development of skin, soft tissue and breast cancer (Hamdi and \nCastellon, 2005; Kimura and Sumiyoshi, 2009; Sepporta et al. , 2014) . \nBesides, OL has an hepatoprotective  effects on carbon tetrachloride -induced liver damage \nin mice (Domitrovi\u0107 et al. , 2012) . Also, there are studies about the capacity of OL supplementation \nto reduce lipid accumulation in the liver of mice fed with a high fat diet probably it has been \nassociated with down -regulation of hepatic lipogenesis and up -regulation of visceral fat \nthermogenesi s (Barbaro et al. , 2014) . \nOL exerts an antimicrobial activity against both Gram negative  and positive  bacteria  \n(Cicerale, Lucas and Keast, 2012) , and it has certain antimycop lasmal activity (Furneri et al. , 2002)  \nalso against Mycoplasmas  which are resistant to common antibiotic therapy. OL also possesses a \nwide antiviral activity. It could be effective against hepatitis B virus (HBV), hemorrhagic septicemia \nrhabdoviru s (VHSV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Micol et al. , 2005; Lee -Huang et \nal., 2007; Zhao, Yin and Dong, 2009) . Its action against HIV has been correlated to its ability to bind \nand inhibit HIV -1 integrase activity, so OL represents a suitable molecular template f or HIV -1 \nintegrase inhibitors (Lee -Huang et al. , 2007) . \nIn order to evaluate the potential neuroprotective activity of OL, there ar e studies which shows \nthat OL administration improved the antioxidant enzymes activities in midbrain in aged rats \n(Sarbishegi, Mehraein and Soleimani, 2014) , providing a new hope for prevention/attenuation   Introduction  \n \n30 \n damage associated with Park inson\u2019s disease. Also, there are others studies such as the work of Park \net al., (Park et al. , 2017)  that validate the potential neuroprotective of OL because of it revealed that \nOL close to hydroxyframoside A, fraxamosid e and jaspolyoside exhibited potent stimulation of \nNGF release in a C6 rat glioma ce ll line. OL was also indicated as a molecule with a therapeutic \npotential against Alzheimer\u2019s disease, because is an inhibitor of Tau, a microtubule -associated \nprotein known to aberrantly from amyloid -positive aggregates characteristic of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \n(Daccache et al. , 2011) . \n \n2.2. Oleocanthal  \nSince the moment when oleocanthal was discovered in 1 993 (Montedoro et al. , 1993) , it has \nattracted several attentions. For this reason, there are a lot of studies about it and their healthy \nbeneficial properties. Beauc hamp et al. (Beauchamp et al. , 2005)  reported the anti -inflammatory \nactions of this secoiridoid, for first time, compared with ibuprofen, a non -steroideal anti -\ninflammatory drug. This work reported that oleocanthal was able to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) -\n1 and COX -2 in a dose -dependent in vitro  assay. Oleocanthal exhibited better anti -inflammatory \naction than ibuprofen (Beauchamp et al. , 2005) .  In this line, this phenolic compound can act in \ncharacteristic inflammation mediators as iNOS  and NO production in ATDC -5 and J774A.1 \nlipopolysaccharide ( LPS)-stimulated, such as pro -inflammatory cytokines (IL -1\u03b2, IL -6, MIP -1\u03b1, \nTNF -\u03b1) (Iacono et al. , 2010; Scotece et al. , 2012) . These actions of oleocanthal have been related with \npossible signalling pathways: MAPKs (p38, ERK 1/2, JNK), JAK/STAT and inflammasome  NLRP3  \nin LPS -stimulated cells (Iacono et al. , 2010; Montoya et al. , 2019) .  \nNevertheless, antioxidants effects have been described in assays with this bioactive \ncompound. Montoya et al. (Montoya et al. , 2019)  have reported that murine peritoneal \nmacrophages LPS -stimulated and treated with oleocanthal presented a modulation of NO, reactive \noxygen species (ROS) and iNOS expressio n. Bes ides of that, Nrf -2/HO -1 signal ing pathway was \npostulated as possible main mechanism implicated in antioxidant activity of oleocanthal, and \nprotein expression of both of them was up -regulated (Montoya et al. , 2019) . \nIn this line, oleocanthal repressed nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase \nactivity and controlled intracellular superoxide anion level in isolated human monocytes \n(Takashima et al. , 2014) . \nIn terms of antimicrobial activity, oleocanthal exhibited action against Escherichia coli, \nSalmonella enterica, L isteria monocytogenes and Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus and \nEnterococcus faecalis (Romero et al. , 2007; Pang and Chin, 2018) . \nOleocanthal as anticarcinogenic agent has been the most studied property. The re are a \nlarge amount of evidential studies about different types where this secoiridoid inhibited migration, \nangiogenesis and metastasis, and induced apoptosis of cancerous cell lines from breast, prostate,   Introduction  \n \n31 \n colon, liver cancer or melanoma, among others  (Mohyeldin et al. , 2016; Pei  et al. , 2016; Ayoub et al. , \n2017; Cusimano et al. , 2017; Gu, Wang and Peng, 2017) . Though, there is not available an enormous \nvariety of in vivo  studies. However, oleocanthal  has been postulated as a natural promise in this \nfield to future treatments and prevention (Elnagar, Sylvester and El Sayed, 2011) . \n \n2.3. Oleacein  \nOleacein is maybe one of the most unknown secoiridoid  of olive. It is not exist high variety \nof studies about this compound; however, today it is a natural agent promise. Antioxidant, anti -\ninflammatory, antimicrobial and antitumor activities are some newsworthy beneficial effects from \noleacein.  \nIt inhibits o xidant -activated MMP -9 and IL -8 production in human neutrophils \n(Czerwi\u0144ska, Kiss and Naruszewicz, 2014) .  Paiva -Martins et al. supported the free -radical \nscavenging action of oleacein  in human erythrocyte, where demonstrated a marked role against \nROS -induced oxidative injury than HTy  or OL (Paiva -Martins and Pinto, 2008) .  \nIn terms of anti -inflammatory activity, in human macrophages, oleacein enhanced CD163 \nreceptor expression, an an ti-inflammatory gene, increasing IL -10 and heme oxygenase -1 (HO-1) \nexpression (Filipek et al. , 2015) . Oleacein decreased MMP -9, at the same time HO -1 and IL -10 \nrelease increased (Filipek et al. , 2017) . Besides, this compound has shown to be more effective \ninhibitor of 5 -LOX enzyme than oleocanthal (Vougogiannopoulou et al. , 2014) .  \nIn vitro , anticancerous activity was related by promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in \nhuman multiple myeloma (Juli et al. , 2019) .  \nAntibacterial activity was weaker compa red to oleocanthal, while oleacein only has shown \nbactericide effect on Helicobacter pylori  (Romero et al. , 2007) . \n \n2.4. Ligstroside aglycon  \nLigstroside aglycon is a by -product of ligstroside . Thought, not exits a lot of studies about \nthem, there are more data about aglycon form.  \nMedina et al., concluded that among others polyphenols of EVOO, ligstroside aglycon \npresented a marked bactericidal potential against a broad spectrum of microorganis m (Medina et \nal., 2006) . In terms of antioxidant activity, various authors have repor ted this effect on plasma LDL \n(Tripoli et al. , 2005) . Ligstroside aglycon showed strong tumoricidal  effects in HER -2 \noverexpression breast carcinomas in a dose -and time -dependent manner (Menendez et al. , 2008) . \n \nParticularly, the antioxidant, anti -inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of \nsecoiridoids from olive tree (leaves and fruits) have been suggested as a potentia l application in   Introduction  \n \n32 \n several immuno inflammatory diseases. Thus, the purpose of this review is summarize recent \nadvances in the protective role of these secoiridoids derived from olive tree (pre -clinical \nstudies  and clinical trials)  in autoimmune diseases focusing on their mechanisms on RA, SLE, IBD \nand MS . \n \n3. POTENTIAL EFFEC TS OF SECOIRIDOIDS FROM  Olea europea  L. IN AUTOIMMUNE \nDISEASES  \n \nAutoimmune diseases are heterogeneous groups of diseases which condition is that your \nimmune system mistakenly attacks your body. I normal state, the immune system is able to \ndifference between foreign cells, such as viruses and bacteria, and own cells. Ho wever, in an \nautoimmune disease, the immune system recognize our own cells like foreign cells and it releases \nproteins called autoantibodies that attack healthy cells. These types of diseases could appear at any \nstage of life with higher or lower severity.  For example, there are types of autoimmune disease \nwhose target only one organ, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) which damages the pancreas, \nand there are other diseases, like SLE which affect the whole body.  \nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH)  estimates up to 23.5 million of American suffer from \nautoimmune disease and that the prevalence is rising in 2019. For this reason, autoimmune diseases \nare recognized like a major health problem. Nowadays, researchers have identified 80 -100 different \nauto immune diseases and suspect at least 40 more diseases of having an autoimmune basis. Also, \nthese diseases are chronic and can be life -threatening. These kinds of diseases are one of top 10 \nleading causes of death in female children and women in all age gro ups up to 64 years ago (Lerner, \nJeremias and Matthias, 2016) . \nThe most characteristics examples of these  kinds of autoimmune diseases are:  \n \n\uf0b7 RA \nRA can be defined as a chronic inflammatory disease with systemic autoimmune \ncomponent, and is mainly characterized by aggressive synovial hyperplasia, synovitis, progressive \ndestruction of cartilage, and bone erosion  with painful swelling of small joints, fatigue, prolonged \nstiffness and fever caused by immune responses and specific innate inflammatory processes \n(Rosillo et al. , 2016). Worldwide, the annual incidence of RA is approximately 3 cases per 10000 \npopulations, and the prevalence rate is approximately 1% increasing with age and peaking between \nthe ages of 35 and 50 years. RA affects all populations, through it is much mo re prevalent in some \ngroups (e.g. 5 -6% in some Native American groups) and much less prevalent in others (e.g. black \npersons from the Caribbean region) (Smolen, Aletaha and McInnes, 2016) . \n   Introduction  \n \n33 \n \uf0b7 SLE \nSLE can be defined as a chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease that can affect \nmultiple organ system, including skin, joints, kidneys and the brain among others (Noble et al. , \n2016) . SLE is characterized by a deposition of immune complexes, formed in large amounts as \nantinuclear antibodies bind to the abundant nuclear material in blood and tissues, along with \ndisturbances in both innate and adaptive immunity and T -cell signaling. Also, SLE is characterized \nby its clinical and pathogenic complexity, difficult diagnosis and the high number of complications \nthat can affects the patient\u2019s quality of life (Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2017) . There are worldwide \ndifferences in the incidence and prevalence of SLE that vary with sex, age, ethnicity and time. The \nhighest estimates of incidence and prevalence of SLE were in North America 23.2/10000 \npersons/years and 24/10000 people respectively. The lowest incidences of SLE were reported in \nAfrica and Ukraine (0.3/10000 persons /years) and the lowest prevale nce was in Northern \nAustralia (0  cases in sample of 847 people). Women were more frequently affected those men for \nevery age and ethnic group. Incidence peaked in middle adulthood and occurred later for men. \nPeople of black et hnicity had the highest incidence and prevalence of SLE, whereas those with \nwhile ethnicity had the lowest incidence and prevalence. These appeared to be an increasing trend \nof SLE prevalence with time (Rees et al. , 2017) . \n \n\uf0b7 IBD  \nCrohn\u2019s disease and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) are important chronic inflammatory disorders \nof the gastrointestinal system that contributes to the inflammatory bowel conditions, that includes \ndiarrhea with or without blood, abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, inflammation and ulcers. These \ndiseases have uncertain etiology but can be associated with multifactorial conditions in terms of \nimmunity, genetics and non -immune conditions such as environmental factors (Lopes de Oliveira \net al. , 2019) . The total number of new cases of Crohn\u2019s disease  diagnosed each year (incidence) was \n10.7 per 100000 people or approximately 33000 new cases  per year. The total number of new cases \nof UC diagnosed each year was 12.2 per 100000 people or approximately 38000 new cases per year \n(Shivas hankar et al. , 2017) . \n \n\uf0b7 T1DM  \nT1DM is considered an autoimmune disease which results from the destruction of \npancreatic \u03b2 -cells that is mediated by the immune system. This is caused by an autoimmune \nreaction where the body\u2019s defense system attacks the cel ls that produce insulin. As a result, the \nbody produces very little or no insulin. Multiple genetic and environmental factors found in \nvariable combinations in individual patients are involved in the development of T1DM. Genetic   Introduction  \n \n34 \n risk is defined by the pres ence of particular allele combinations, which in the major susceptibility \nlocus (the HLA region) affect T -cell recognition and tolerance to foreign and autologous molecules. \nT1DM can affect people at any age but usually develops in children or young adults . Around 10% \nof all people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes (Ilonen, Lempainen and Veijola, 2019) . \nDue to the high prevalence and rising inci dence of this kind of disease, nowadays, there is \na requirement to investigate to develop palliative remedies or treatments that help us improve the \nsymptoms and management of these types of diseases to improve the quality of life of patients. A \nnew source  of news alternative for autoimmune diseases is based to use a natural compounds \nobtain from natural resources, such as Olea europaea  L., which is used traditionally as diuretic, \nhypotensive, emollient, laxative, febrifuge, skin cleanser, and also used for  the treatment of urinary \ninfections, gallstones, bronchial asthma and diarrhea due to its beneficial effects which have been \nallowed to distinguish it from other species.  \n \nThe studies of the effects of secoiridoids  from olive tree are summarized in following \ntables:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 35 \n \nTable 1.

CONCLUSION  \n \nThere is evidence indicating that secoiridoids from olive tree has potential as a therapy for \na wide variety of chronic autoinmune  diseases. The remarkable anti -inflammatory and \nimmunomodulatory effects of these bioactive compounds have been reported in several in vitro  and \nexperimental models of RA, SLE, IBD, T1DM  and MS. Particularly, OL, oleocanthal and oleacein \nmay exert a remark able inmmunodulatory and antiinflammatory effects reducing the induced \ninflammatory response in murine macrophages and human fibroblasts. This was accompanied by \nan amelioration on production of essential proinflammatory cytokines involving in the regulati on \nof the immune system response through prevention of mitogen -activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) \nand nuclear transcription factor -kappaB ( NF-\u03baB) pathways activation. Moreover, OL and oleacein \nsecoiridoids were effective in preventing the induced immuno -inflammatory response in animal \nexperimental models of colitis, MS, T1DM  and SLE. In general, the published data revealed \nconsistent and very satisfactory results; however, the knowledge is very limitated, especially in \nclinical trials. In this sense, further  efforts are needed to mechanistically clarify the underlying \nbiochemical and biological activities and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of secoiridoids \nfrom olive tree in additional preclinical and clinical studies of chronic autoinmune diseases.  \n \nReferences  \n\uf0b7 De A.

Las IMID dan lugar a sustanciales niveles de morbilidad, una \nimportante reducci\u00f3n de la calidad de vida y muertes prematuras. Algunas de las  m\u00e1s com\u00fanmente \nincluida s en este grupo son la artritis reumatoide (AR) y el lupus eritematoso sist\u00e9mico  (LES) (Puig et al. , \n2019)  .  \nLa AR es una enfermedad cr\u00f3nica inflamatoria autoinmune de distribuci\u00f3n universal.  Cursa con \nuna sinovitis erosiva sim\u00e9trica, en la que el tejido de granulaci\u00f3n del sinovio ( pannus ) degenera, \ninvadiendo y erosionando al cart\u00edlago y al hueso de las articul aciones diartrodiales. Comprende una \namplia gama de caracter\u00edsticas, desde la enfermedad progresivamente cr\u00f3nica con grados variables de \ndestrucci\u00f3n articular hasta las manifestaciones extraarticulares cl\u00ednicamente evidentes . \nEn Espa\u00f1a tiene una prevalencia del 0.5 % que aumenta con la edad  y es unas 3 veces mayor en \nmujeres que en hombres.  Su incidencia es de 0.08 a 0. 20 casos/ 1000 personas -a\u00f1o (Andrade et al. , 2017) .   \nEl 80 % de los pacientes suelen iniciar la enfermedad entre los 35 y 50 a\u00f1os (Gonz\u00e1lez Cernadas, \nRodr\u00edguez -Romero and Carballo -Costa, 2014) . La AR est\u00e1 asociada con una disminuci\u00f3n de la calidad de \nvida y con un exceso de mortalidad del 85% en comparaci \u00f3n con la poblaci\u00f3n general . Adem\u00e1s  la AR \nrepresenta un problema de salud relevante tanto para el propio paciente como para la sociedad y el \nSistema Nacional de Salud, ya que es responsable de hasta un 5% de las incapacidades laborales en Espa\u00f1a  \n(Fauci and Langford, 2010) .   \nLa etiolog\u00eda de AR se desconoce aunque factores gen\u00e9ticos, infecciosos (infecci\u00f3n viral, e.g. Viru s \nEpsein -Barr, Proteus, rubeola, etc.), ambienta les (tabaco, situaciones de estr\u00e9s y traumatismo,  obesidad, \ndieta) y hormonales parecen est\u00e1n involucrados en v\u00edas relacionadas y complejas  (Suzuki and Ya mamoto, \n2015) . Se han identificado m\u00faltiples genes que contribuyen a la predisposici\u00f3n y susceptibilidad a la \nenfermedad fundamentalmente el gen  HLA -DRB1  del complejo mayor de histocompatibilidad , PADI4, \nPTPN22, CCR6  FCRL3  (Suzuki and Yamamoto, 2015) , TIM -3 rs1036199  (Razi et al. , 2019)  as\u00ed como el gen \nUBASH3A  y sus polimorfismos  (rs1893592 and rs3788013)  (Yang et al. , 2019)  \nAunque n o existe consenso sobre la naturaleza del autoant\u00edgeno(s) o factores ambientales que \ninician la desregulaci\u00f3n de la respuesta inmune ,   el proceso inflamatorio es orquestado por macr\u00f3fagos, \nc\u00e9lulas T reguladoras (Tregs),  c\u00e9lulas T reguladoras  (Th)-1 y Th17  y c\u00e9lulas T citot\u00f3xicas que generan un  \ndesbalance  de la producci\u00f3n de citocinas  Th1: interfer\u00f3n  (IFN) -\uf067,  factor de necrosis tumoral  (TNF) -\u03b1 y las \ninterleuc inas (IL) -1\u03b2, IL -2 , IL -4, IL -6, IL -13 , IL -15 IL -6, IL -23,  IL -27,  IL -35 ; Th17 (IL -17, IL -21) y, de \ncitocinas Th2: (IL -10, IL -20, IL -22),  quimioquinas (receptor de quimiocinas CXC tipo 4 (C XCR4 ), prote\u00edna \ninducida por  IFN -\u03b3 (IP)-10, factor 1 derivado de c\u00e9lulas estromales ( SDF1 ), prote\u00edna quimiot\u00e1ctica de \nmonocitos ( MCP )-1),  y metaloproteinasas  (MMP -3 y MMP -9) capaces de digerir el cart\u00edlago (Brzustewicz \nand Bryl, 2015) . Las v\u00edas de se\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n molecular comprometidas incluyen los factores nucleares de \ntranscripci\u00f3n : NF-\uf06bB, FO XP3 y las prote\u00ednas  cinasas activadas por mit\u00f3genos  (MAPK s): c-Jun NH 2 \u2013\nterminal cinasa (JNK) y p38 cinasa  fundamentalmente (Han et al. , 2001; McInnes and Schett, 2011; Nie et \nal., 2013) .    Justificaci\u00f3n y Objetivos  \n \n53 \n Por otro lado, los fibroblastos sinoviales (FS) son el componente celular m\u00e1s importante que \nresiden en la membrana sinovial de las articulaciones, y juegan un papel fundamental en la patogenia y \ndesarrollo en la AR (Firestein, 1996) . Los FS son  inicialmente activados por el microambiente local y \nposteriormente adquieren un fenotipo pseudomaligno con activaci\u00f3n  de ciertos  oncogenes,  que  secretan   \ncitocinas, quimiocinas, MMP s y catepsinas  colabora ndo en el proceso inflamatorio cr\u00f3nico y catalizan do la \ndestrucci\u00f3n articular  (Chang, Gu and Brenner, 2010) .La identificaci\u00f3n de las v\u00edas de se\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n molecular \nimplicadas  en las alteraciones de los FS es  la base para el desarrollo de terapias alternativas de la \ninflamaci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica y da\u00f1o articular dirigidas al sistema inmunitario, y constituyen un m\u00e9todo de estudio \nvalidado para la AR.  \nEl abordaje terap\u00e9utico de la AR es multidisciplinar, y est\u00e1 dirigido  principalmente a la supresi\u00f3n \ninespec\u00edfica del proceso inflamatorio con el objetivo de mitigar los s\u00edntomas y signos de la enfermedad \nenglobando  tratamientos m\u00e9dico,  fisioter\u00e1pico y otro grupo de m\u00e9todos dentro del que se incluyen las \nmedidas diet\u00e9ticas   (Fauci and Langford, 2010) . \nLa terapia farmacol\u00f3gica de la AR  debe iniciarse de forma  temprana y  est\u00e1 destinada a mejorar \nel controlar el curso de la enfermedad y prevenir la progresi\u00f3n del ta\u00f1o tisular. La primera l\u00ednea \nterap\u00e9utica incluye f\u00e1rmacos que suprimen la inflamaci\u00f3n como los anti -inflamatorios no esteroideos \n(AINE)  que se  deben utilizar a la menor dosis efectiva y el menor tiempo posible  y los glucocorticoides  a \ndosis bajas asociados a f\u00e1rmacos antirreum\u00e1ticos modificadores de la enfermedad  (FAME), en periodos \ncortos  para aliviar los s\u00edntomas.  \n Los FAME son f\u00e1rmacos de acci\u00f3n relativamente lenta que adem\u00e1s de proporcionar control \nsintom\u00e1tico de los s\u00edntomas, han demostrado evitar la progresi\u00f3n del da\u00f1o estructural e inducir la \nremisi\u00f3n de la enfermedad. En la actualidad, los FAME se dividen en tr es grandes grupos: F AME \nconvencionales (metotrexato (MTX), leflunomida, hidroxicloroquina o sulfasalazina), FAME biol\u00f3gicos \n(agentes anti -TNF \u03b1 [infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certo lizumab y golimumab ], bloque ante de  la \nactivaci\u00f3n de linfocitos T [ abatacept] , f\u00e1rmacos anti-IL-6 [tocilizumab y sarilumab],  anti-CD20 [ rituximab ], \ninhibidor de la IL -1 [anakinra] , y FAME sint\u00e9ticos dirigi dos (baricitinib y tofacitinib) (Rosillo, Alarc\u00f3n -de-\nla-Lastra and S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo, 2016; Terap, Il - and Americano, 2 018). \nLas \u00faltimas recomendaciones para el abordaje y tratamiento de la AR publicadas por GUIP CAR \n(2017) (D\u00edaz, 2017)  recomiendan el uso  de tratamiento biol\u00f3gico cuando no se alcanza el objetivo \nterap\u00e9utico deseado con un primer FAME (preferiblemente MTX)  o la combinaci\u00f3n de varios  y adem\u00e1s \nexisten  factores de mal pron\u00f3stico  o elevada actividad de la enfermedad . En muchas situaciones el \ntratamiento basado en el uso de FAME  se debe suspender por ineficacia,  intolerancia, presencia de efectos \nadversos o contraindicaciones  por comorbilidades  (Ruiz -Esquide and Sanmarti, 2018) . \nPor todo ello,  aunque  en la  actualidad  existen nuevos  f\u00e1rmacos  desarrollados para la AR, \nninguna combinaci\u00f3n de ellos proporciona  una alternativa de tratamiento  eficaz que consiga  controlar la \nenfermedad de manera continua, y que por otro lado sean seguros para los pacientes de uso cr\u00f3nico.    \nJunto a la AR, otra enfe rmedad  IMID  de creciente inter\u00e9s en la actualidad, debido a los \ncondicionantes que su ponen para los pacientes en su calidad de vida es el LES.   Justificaci\u00f3n y Objetivos  \n \n54 \n El LES es una enfermedad autoinmune inflamatoria cr\u00f3nica cuya afectaci\u00f3n puede alcanzar \ndiversos \u00f3rganos, provo cando un deterioro generalizado y progresivo que compromete ampliamente a la \ncalidad de vida de los pacientes.  Est\u00e1 considerada como una enfermedad rara seg\u00fan la denominaci\u00f3n de \nesta por la Comisi\u00f3n Europea \u201cRegulation on Orphan Medicinal Products\u201d.  Es una enfermedad de \netiopatogen ia muy compleja, cuyo diagn\u00f3 stico es muy dif\u00edcil y que supone numerosas complicaciones en \nel seguimiento y control de los individuos que l a padece n (Noble et al. , 2016) . LES p resenta un curso muy \nvariable, con periodos alternados de exacerbaciones y remisione s, que pueden afectar a m\u00faltiples sistemas \ndel organismo. Sus manifestaciones cl\u00ednicas m\u00e1s comunes son fatiga, p\u00e9rdida de peso y de apetitivo, \nafectaciones cut\u00e1neas  ,  renales y  del sistema nervioso , dolores articulares, y as\u00ed como manifestaciones \nhematol \u00f3gicas (citopenias), y un aumento del riesgo de sufrir eventos adversos vasculares (Lisnevskaia, \nMurphy and Isenberg, 2014; Herrmann et al. , 2015; Choi et al. , 2017; Mar\u00edn et al. , 2019) .  \nLa prevalencia de esta enfermedad oscila entre 20 y 150 casos por cada 100.000 habitantes de la \npoblaci\u00f3n mundial, con una amplia variabilidad geogr\u00e1fica y \u00e9tnica. Existe una mayor incidencia en \nmujeres en edad f\u00e9rtil que en hombres, y aunque los s\u00edntomas pueden llegar a aparecer a cualquier edad, \nla mayor\u00eda de los casos se concentran entre los 25 o 35 a\u00f1os (Vina et al. , 2014) . En Espa\u00f1a, se estima \nactualmente una prevalencia media de 0.13% en hombres y de 0.32 % en mujeres (Puig et al. , 2019)  \nLa etiolog\u00eda del LES  es desconocida , aunque factores gen\u00e9ticos, medioambientales (dieta, estr\u00e9s \nextremo, exposici\u00f3n a rayos ultravioleta, infecciones), la administraci\u00f3n d e ciertos medicamentos (algunos \nantidepresivos y antibi\u00f3t icos) y hormonales (estr\u00f3genos)  parecen est\u00e1n involucrados en v\u00edas relacionadas \ny complejas  (Cai et al. , 2014; Mak and Tay, 2014; Ruiz -Larra\u00f1aga et al. , 2016; Lewis and Jawad, 2017) .  En \neste contexto, los factores ambientales diet\u00e9ticos espec\u00edficos, incluyendo vitaminas, elementos minerales, \n\u00e1cidos grasos y polifenoles, parecen tener un papel importante en la modulaci\u00f3n de la respuesta inmune \n(Somers and Richardson, 2014) . As\u00ed, en  una reciente revisi\u00f3n llevada a cabo por nuestro equipo  hemos \nanalizado el papel de la dieta en la prevenci\u00f3n y manejo del LES, y de c\u00f3mo c iertos componentes de la \ndieta pueden mejorar o bien constituir un factor de riesgo etiopatog\u00e9nico importante  (Aparicio -Soto, \nS\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo and Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra, 2017) . \nEl papel de los factores gen\u00e9ticos en la patog\u00e9nesis del LES es evidente por la alta heredabilidad  \n(43.9%) y el riesgo relativo en familiares de primer grado de pacientes con LES. Aunque la enfermedad \npuede desarrollarse a partir de una deficiencia de un solo gen, como la del componente del complemento \n1q (C1q) subcomponente A (C1qA), C1qB, C1qC, la ex onucleasa de reparaci\u00f3n de tres cepas 1 (TREX1) o la \ndesoxirribonucleasa 1 similar a 3 (DNASE1L3), en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, la enfermedad es el resultado \nde una combinaci\u00f3n de m\u00faltiples efectos de variantes gen\u00e9ticas. Existen multitud de loci humanos \nrelacionados con funciones del sistema inmunitario deterioradas en el LES: por ejemplo, el factor \nregulador del interfer\u00f3n (IRF )-5, IRF7, el transductor de se\u00f1al y activador de la transcripci\u00f3n (STAT) -4, \nreceptor tipo Toll (TLR )-7, TLR8 y TLR9 est\u00e1 n involucr ados en la detecci\u00f3n de \u00e1 cido s nucleicos y la \nproducci\u00f3n de (IFN) -I por las c\u00e9lulas presentadoras de ant\u00edgenos, inclu idas las c\u00e9lulas dendr\u00edticas (DC ) \ncontribuyendo a la generaci\u00f3n de un ambiente proinflamatorio caracter\u00edstico de la enfermedad  (Moulton et \nal., 2017) .    Justificaci\u00f3n y Objetivos  \n \n55 \n Desde el punto de vista patol\u00f3gico, LES es una patolog\u00eda  inflamatoria cr\u00f3nica que se caracteriza \npor una alteraci\u00f3n de la res puesta inmunitaria  definida   por la p\u00e9rdida de la autotolerancia de las c\u00e9lulas T \ny B con la consiguiente hiperactividad linfoc \u00edtica,  la producci\u00f3n de autoanticuerpos (antinuclear, a ntiDNA \nde doble cadena, anti-Ro, antihistona, anti -Smith y anti -ribonucleoproteina, RNP Anti -prot\u00e9ina P \nribosomal , entre otros ), la formaci\u00f3n de inmunocomplejos aberrantes (ICs ), y la generaci\u00f3n de una \nrespuesta inflamatoria polisist\u00e9mica. La generaci\u00f3n de los ICs as\u00ed como una sobreproducci\u00f3n de IFN-\u03b1 son \ncaracter\u00edsticas del LES (Herrada et al. , 2019) .  \nLos anticuerpos e ICs, as\u00ed como el desbalance en la producci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas T \n(Th1/Th2/Th17/Th9/Th22)  y c\u00e9lulas Treg  contribuyen al da\u00f1o tisular y parecen estar involucrados en la \naparici\u00f3n de la respuesta inflamatoria multisist\u00e9mica, especialmente en la fase activa de la enfermedad  \n(Dolff et al. , 2011) . Estudios recientes sugieren que las c\u00e9lulas T \u03b3\u03b4 pueden estar involucradas en la \nregulaci\u00f3n del LES debido a sus efectos en la producci\u00f3n de citocinas, presentaci\u00f3n de ant\u00edgenos y  su \npapel en la p roducci\u00f3n de anticuerpos mediante la estimulaci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas B  (Wu et al. , 2016) . Pacientes \ncon LES  activo presentan t\u00edpicamente incrementados los niveles de citocinas proinflamatorias como IFN -\u03b3, \nIL-6, IL10, IL -12, IL -17, IL -18, IL -21 y IL -23, al contrario que la IL -2 que se caracteriza por encontrarse a \nniveles m\u00e1s bajos comparados con pacientes sanos  (Comte, Karampetsou and Tsokos, 2015; Zhao et al. , \n2016; Jiang et al. , 2019) . \nLas v\u00edas de se\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n molecular comprometidas en estos procesos incluyen a los factores de \ntranscripci\u00f3n nuclear NF -\u03baB, FOXP3, las MAPKs (ERK 1/2, JNK y p38) y Janus quinasas -transductor de \nse\u00f1al y activador de la transcripci\u00f3n ( JAK/STAT ), y m\u00e1s recientemente la v\u00eda del inflamasoma NLRP3 y la \nv\u00eda de factor nuclear eritroide 2 (Nrf2) y la enzima antioxidante hemo oxigenasa -1 (HO -1) (Bloch et al. , \n2014; Marina Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2016; Aparicio -Soto, S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo, et al. , 2017; Yi, 2018) . La secreci\u00f3n \nde citocinas proinflamatorias a sangre produce una amplificaci\u00f3n de la respuesta inflamatoria, \nproduciendo una expresi\u00f3n clonal de linfocitos B sobre todo del tipo inmunoglobulina  G (IgG) , y una \nintensa reacci\u00f3n inflamatoria v\u00eda receptores Toll-like acompa\u00f1ada de una liberaci\u00f3n de citocinas, \nmediadores lip\u00eddicos como el factor activador de plaquetas (PAF), leucotrienos, prostaglandinas (PGs) y \nuna activaci\u00f3n de los neutr\u00f3filos. Los proceso s de adhesi\u00f3n y extravasaci\u00f3n, y la posterior activaci\u00f3n de los \nneutr\u00f3filos se deben a un incremento en la expresi\u00f3n de las adhesinas endoteliales (ICAM -1), selectinas e \nintegrinas leucocitarias. La secreci\u00f3n de proteasas, especies reactivas de ox\u00edgeno (RO S) y mieloperoxidasa \n(MPO) por parte de los neutr\u00f3filos contribuyen tambi\u00e9n al da\u00f1o celular inducido por el LES (Thieblemont \net al. , 2016) . Igualmente, los niveles de MMP -2, MMP -3, MMP -7, MMP -9 y del factor inducible por hipoxia -\n1 (HIF -1) se encuentran elevados en el suero de los pacientes con lupus, por lo que contribuyen tambi\u00e9n a \nla patog\u00e9nesis de la enfermedad  (Gheita et al. , 2015; Phillips et al. , 2017; Vira et al. , 2017; Mao et al. , 2018; \nZhao et al. , 2018) . \nEn la actualidad, no existe un tratamiento eficaz, seguro y efectivo para el LES, por lo que el \nabordaje terap\u00e9utico utilizado se basa sobre todo en el control de las manifestaciones cl\u00ednicas derivadas de \nla enfermedad las cuales son  extremadamente heter og\u00e9neas y multisist\u00e9micas, incluidos s\u00edntomas como \nfiebre y malestar general, manifestaciones dermatol\u00f3gicas, musculoesquel\u00e9ticas, renales, respiratorias, \nhematol\u00f3gicas y neurol\u00f3gicas (Kamal, 2014) . Hasta hace muy poco, el tratamiento del LES se basaba \nprincipalmente en el c onsumo de AINE , glucocorticoides, f\u00e1rmacos antipal\u00fadicos (hidroxicloroquina y   Justificaci\u00f3n y Objetivos  \n \n56 \n cloroquina) as\u00ed como f\u00e1rmacos inmunosupresores (micofen\u00f3lico, ciclofosfamida, MTX, ciclosporina o \nazatioprina) (Kuhn et al. , 2015) . Otros f\u00e1rmacos que se utilizan en el LES son los agentes biol\u00f3gicos \nbelimumam y rituximab. Belimumab se emplea en manifestaciones leves a moderadas como artritis, \nserositis o si hay afectaci\u00f3n cut\u00e1nea y el rituximab se usa cuando  adem\u00e1s hay afecci\u00f3n articular res\u00edstete a \ntratamiento convencional, hematol\u00f3gica, del sistema nervioso central o nefritis resistente  (Cardiel et al. , \n2019) .  \nEsta farmacolog\u00eda es muy comp licada debido a  la importante idiosincrasia  que aparece  entre los \ninvididuos, as\u00ed como la falta de eficacia y seguridad. Es por ello, que actualmente los principales objetivos \nde la investigaci\u00f3n del LES se basan en la b\u00fasqueda de terapias menos t\u00f3xicas y eficaces, que mejoren el \ncurso de la enfermedad . \nLa terapia nutricional , incluyend o modificaciones en el dieta y el uso de complementos \nnutricionales, podr\u00eda ser una interesante alternativa en el control de enfermedades IMID, como la AR y el \nLES por su posible contribuci\u00f3n a la reducci\u00f3n de comorbilidades y a incrementar la calidad de v ida de los \npacientes, ya que adem\u00e1s de su soporte diet\u00e9tico, podr\u00eda ejercer efectos profil\u00e1cticos y terap\u00e9uticos \ncarentes de los efectos indeseables que acompa\u00f1an a la farmacoterapia cl\u00e1sica  (Paolino et al. , 2019) .  \nEl estado nutricional y la ingesta de ciertos alimentos en pacientes con AR o LES podr\u00eda interferir \nen el curso de la enfermedad y por tanto, una dieta equilibrada podr\u00eda mejorar el pron\u00f3s tico y curso de las \nmismas  (Somers and Richardson, 2014; Forsyth et al. , 2018) . En este sentido, diversos estudios \nrecomiendan una dieta rica en fibra derivada de frutas, verduras, cereales integrales, vitaminas, minerales, \n\u00e1cidos grasos m ono- y poliinsaturados y polifenoles, con un consumo reducido de calor\u00edas y sodio, para el \ncontrol de marcadores proinflamatorios y la prevenci\u00f3n de s\u00edntomas y comorbilidades asociadas a estas \npatolog\u00edas  (Lima et al. , 2016; Forsy th et al. , 2018; Khan et al. , 2019) .  \nEn este sentido, r ecientes estudios epidemiol\u00f3gicos y cl\u00ednicos han confirmado que el consumo \nhabitual del aceite de oliva (AO), alimento funcional de primera magnitud, dentro del contexto de la dieta \nmediterr\u00e1nea, es eficaz en la prevenci\u00f3n de la enfermedad cardiovascular y  sus complicaciones (Mart\u00ednez -\nGonz\u00e1lez et al. , 2015; Salas -Salvad\u00f3, Mena -S\u00e1nchez and Jordi Salas -Salvad\u00f3, 2017) . Adem\u00e1s, se han \nobservado efectos beneficiosos en otras patolog\u00edas  como las de \u00edndole  inflamatorio  (S\u00e1nchez -Fidalgo et al. , \n2013; Rosillo et al. , 2016) ,  en el envejecimiento  (Fern\u00e1ndez del R\u00edo et al. , 2016)  y en  diversos tipos de c\u00e1ncer  \n(Cardeno et al. , 2014; Kwan et al. , 2017) .  \nLa modulaci\u00f3n de la respuesta inmune ejercida por dietas que contienen AO se traduce en una \nmenor supresi\u00f3n de la proliferaci\u00f3n de linfo citos, mayor producci\u00f3n de citoc inas anti -inflamatoria \nesenciales en la regulaci\u00f3n de la respuesta inmune y en definitiva, una mayor capacidad fagoc\u00edtica de los \nmacr\u00f3fagos/monocitos, caracter\u00edstica esencial para la eliminaci\u00f3n de los agentes pat\u00f3genos. Por lo tanto, y \nteniendo en cuenta los antecedentes, el AO como un componente de la dieta puede ejercer un efecto \ninmunomodulador (Puertollano et al. , 2010; Aparicio -Soto, S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo and Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra, \n2017) . \n Previamente, nuestro equipo ha evidenciado el funcionalismo del aceite  de oliva virgen extra \n(AOVE ) en patolog\u00edas autoinmunes mediante proyectos en los que se ha valorado el potencial   Justificaci\u00f3n y Objetivos  \n \n57 \n antiinflamatorio cr\u00f3nico e inmunomodulador del AOVE en modelos experimentales de AR y de LES, con \nresultados muy satisfactorios. Particularmen te, se ha puesto de manifiesto c\u00f3mo el AOVE fue eficaz en la \nprevenci\u00f3n de la AR y LES inducidas experimentales a trav\u00e9s de la modulaci\u00f3n de diversos elementos del \nsistema inmune involucrados en la respuesta inmuno -inflamatoria  (M Aparicio -Soto et al., 2016; Marina \nAparicio -Soto et al. , 2016; Rosillo et al. , 2016) .  \n En los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, las propiedades beneficiosas del AOVE, est\u00e1 siendo atribuidas no s\u00f3lo a su \nfracci\u00f3n saponificable, caracterizada por el alto contenido en \u00e1cidos grasos monoinsaturados (\u00e1cido \noleico), sino tambi\u00e9n a las fracciones insaponificables (FI) y polifen\u00f3lica (FP) que, aun siendo minoritarias, \nest\u00e1n constituidas por un amplio n\u00famero de compuestos de alto valor biol\u00f3gico. Interesantes \npublicaciones de nuestro grupo  as\u00ed lo avalan (Cardeno et al. , 2014; Parkinson et al. , 2016; Aparicio -Soto, \nS\u00e1nch\u00e9z -Hidalgo, et al. , 2017) . \nActualmente, existen m\u00e1s de 30 compuesto fen\u00f3licos en el olivo, aunque su composici\u00f3n cuali - y \ncuantitativa depende de la variedad de la aceituna, el grado de maduraci\u00f3n y la climatolog\u00eda. Pueden \nclasificarse en varios grupos: \u00e1cidos fen\u00f3licos, alcoholes fen\u00f3licos, secoiridoides, hidroxi -isocromanos, \nflavonoides y lignanos.  \nLos polifenoles perten ecientes al grupo de los secoirioides se encuentran mayoritariamente  en las \nplantas pertenecientes  a la familia Oleaceae dentro de la cual se incluye la especie Olea europea  L. Son los \ncompuestos m\u00e1s abundantes  y se han relacionado con atributos caracter\u00ed sticos del AO como son el \namargor, la astringencia o el picante. Estos compuestos proceden del metabolismo secundario de los \nterpenos, siendo sintetizados a partir del \u00e1cido meval\u00f3nico. Se caracterizan por la presencia en su \nestructura de un fenil etil alc ohol (3,4 DHPEA o p-HPEA) unido al \u00e1cido elen\u00f3lico o sus derivados, y \ngeneralemente se encuentran glicosilados (Tasioula -Margari and Tsabolatidou, 2015; Parkinson et al. , \n2016) . Entre estos compuestos destacan la Oleurope\u00edna  (OL) y el ligustr\u00f3sido presentes en diferentes \n\u00f3rganos del olivo ( Olea europea  L.) (hoja, madera o fruto), la olace\u00edna, el oleocantal y los aglicones de la \noleurope\u00edna y del ligrustr\u00f3sido que se encuentran en la FP del AO.  \n \n \n \nFigure 1.  Estructura qu\u00edmic a de la  OL. \nLa OL tiene funcionalidad de catec ol y ejerce una potente actividad antioxidante relacionada \nprincipalmente con su capacidad para mejorar la estabilidad de los ROS mediante la formaci\u00f3n de un \n  Justificaci\u00f3n y Objetivos  \n \n58 \n enlace intramolecular  entre el hidr\u00f3geno libre del grupo hidroxilo y sus radicales fenoxilos (Visioli, \nBellomo and Galli, 1998) . Adem\u00e1s,  la OL tiene la capacidad de eliminar el \u00f3xido n\u00edtrico (NO) y \npromover la expresi\u00f3n de la enzima \u00f3xido n\u00edtrico sintasa inducible (iNOS) en c\u00e9lulas (de la Puerta et \nal., 2001) . Tambi\u00e9n posee una ampliamente validada  actividad anti -aterog\u00e9nica, anticancerosa, anti -\nangiog\u00e9nica, neuroprotector a, antimicrobiana y antiviral, gastroprotectora, hepatoprotectora, \nantidiab\u00e9tica, antiobesidad y radioprotectora, entre otras (Hassen, Casabianca and Hosni, 2015) . \n \nEstudios previos han puesto de manifiesto la remarc able actividad anti -inflamatoria de la OL \n(Barbaro et al. , 2014; Marcelino et al. , 2019) .  OL fue capaz de suprimir la respuest a inflamatoria \nproducida en fibroblastos RAW264 estimulados con lipopolisac\u00e1rido (LPS) (Ryu et al. , 2015) . Tambi\u00e9n \nse ha observado un importante efecto protector ante la p\u00e9rdida de cart \u00edlago en lesiones osteoartr\u00edticas \nde cerdos guineanos (Horcajada et al. , 2015) .  El agli c\u00f3n de la OL mejor\u00f3  los niveles de marcadores \ncl\u00ednicos y promovi\u00f3  la mejora del tejido sinovial de las articulaciones  en un modelo murino de artritis \ninducida por col\u00e1geno (CIA) (Impellizzeri et al. , 2011) . Adem\u00e1s,  OL ha demostrado su capacidad para \nreduci r la inflamaci\u00f3 n pulmonar  en modelos experimentales  con c\u00e9lulas epiteliales bronquiales BEAS -\n2B expuestas a IL4 y en ratones BALB/c expuestos a cigarrillos y a ovoalb\u00famina  (Kim et al. , 2018) . \nAdem\u00e1s,  OL mejor\u00f3 considerablemente el da\u00f1o col\u00f3nico agudo  en un modelo murino inducido por \nDSS, as\u00ed como  minimiz\u00f3 los efectos inducidos en un modelo  murino de  colitis  ulcerosa asociado a  \nc\u00e1ncer colorrecta l (Giner et al. , 2011, 2013, 2016) . \n \n Quiz\u00e1s uno de los principales inconvenientes de los fenoles es su termo y fotolabilidad, as\u00ed como \nsu inestabilidad frente a la oxidaci\u00f3n. Asimismo, presentan unas caracter\u00edsticas biofarmac\u00e9uticas que \nlimitan su absorci\u00f3n oral, debido a sus deficientes capa cidades de permeabilidad a trav\u00e9s de las \nmembranas, la baja solubilidad de su forma libre en los fluidos acuosos, as\u00ed como importantes efectos \nde metabolizaci\u00f3n presist\u00e9mica intestinal y eflujo mediado por la glicoprote\u00edna P, ocasionando valores \nde biodisp onibilidad muy bajos  (Bohn, 2014) . Por ello, numeros os estudios han remarcado la \nimportancia de los derivados acetilados sintetizados a partir de compuestos fen\u00f3licos naturales con el \nfin de mejorar las propiedades de las mol\u00e9culas originales, as\u00ed pues como m ejorar su \nbiodisponibilidad, la penetraci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de la membrana celular y mejorar as\u00ed sus propiedades \nantiinflamatorias y anti -oxidantes. De esta manera, la acetilaci\u00f3n de las mol\u00e9culas de los compuestos \nnaturales nos proporciona una posibilidad de mej orar los perfiles farmacocin\u00e9ticos y \nfarmacodin\u00e1micos de los compuestos naturales y podr\u00eda ser una nueva estrategia para el tratamiento \nde enfermedades de \u00edndole inmunoinflamatorio (de Ara\u00fajo et al. , 2017; Rizzo et al. , 2017) . \nA pesar del creciente inter\u00e9s de este secoiridoide, no existen hasta la fecha, estudios \nexperimentales en modelos de inmunoinflamaci\u00f3n in vitro , ex vivo  e in vivo  que validen el potencial \nantirreum\u00e1tico de OL, as\u00ed como los mecanismos bioqu\u00edmicos y v\u00edas de se\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n implicados.  \nPor ello, el objetivo principal  de esta Tesis Doctoral es el estudio precl\u00ednico de OL, un \nsecoiridoide del olivo ( Olea europea  L.) y de sus derivados acetilados en modelos experimentales de \ninmunoinflamaci\u00f3n de AR y LES. Concretamente, nos hemos centrado en una serie de objetivos \nespec\u00edficos:    Justificaci\u00f3n y Objetivos  \n \n59 \n 1.   Investigar los posibles efectos inmunomoduladores y antiinflamatorios de la OL y sus \nderivado s semisint\u00e9ticos, as\u00ed como explorar los mecanismos moleculares y v\u00edas de se\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n \ninvolucradas en el proceso, en:  \na.  Un modelo ex vivo de macr\u00f3fagos peritoneales murinos estimulados con LPS.  \nb. Un modelo in vitro de una l\u00ednea celular de fibroblastos s inoviales humanos (SW982) \nestimulados con IL -1\u03b2. \n2.      Evaluar  los efectos de dietas enriquecidas con OL y la OL peracetilada (Per -OL) en un \nmodelo de artritis inducida por col\u00e1geno tipo II en ratones DBAJ/1 y explorar los mecanismos \nmoleculares y las v \u00edas de se\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n posiblemente implicadas.  \n3.      Estudiar los efectos potenciales de dietas enriquecidas con OL y Per -OL en un modelo de \nLES in ducido por pristano (2,4,6,10,16 - tetrametilpentadecano) en ratones BALB/c y explorar los \nmecanismos moleculares subyacentes y las v\u00edas de se\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n probablemente involucradas en el \nproceso.  \n \nBibliograf\u00eda  \n\uf0b7 Andrade, P. et al.

Nitrites levels were \nanalyzed by Griess method and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by fluorescence \nanalysis. The levels of cytokines were evaluated by ELISA. The protei n expression of \ncyclooxigenase -2(COX -2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), janus kinase/signal transducer \nactivator of t ranscription (JAK/STAT) pathway, heme oxygenase -1 (HO -1), nuclear factor \n(erythroid -derived 2) -like 2  (Nrf2) and mitogen -activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) activat ion were \ndetermined by Western B lotting.  \nThe mechanisms underlying these protective effects could be related to the activation of Nrf2/HO -\n1 pat hway and inhibition of both JAK/ STAT and MAPKs  pathways . We con clude that OL and new \nOL acetyl ated -derivatives exhibited immunomodulatory effects and thus, may offer a new \npromising therapeutic strategy in the management of immune mediated -inflammatory diseases.  \n \nKEYWORDS:  HO-1; LPS; macrophage; Nrf2; oleuropein; ROS  \n \n \nChapter I  \n \n68 \n  \n \n \n \n \n1. INTRODUCTION  \n \nMacrophages are main components of the innate immune system and play a crucial \nfunction in the inflammatory process, recognizing an extensive variety of pathogen -associated \nmolecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an outer  membrane component of gram -\nnegative bacteria, via pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll -like receptor (TLR) family of \nproteins  (Kawai and Akira 2011) . LPS exposure drives macrophages to an activated state that \ninduces an excess o f inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E 2 \n(PGE 2), as well as proinflammatory  cytokines, includi ng tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -\u03b1, interleukin \n(IL)-1\u03b2, IL -6 and interferon (IFN) -\u03b3. Moreover, LPS induces the expression of different  enzymes \nsuch as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclo -oxygenase 2 (COX -2), which are regulated \nby the activation of mitogen -activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) and the nuclear transcription fact or \nkappa B (NF -\u03baB) (Cardeno, Sanchez -Hidalgo, Aparicio -Soto, and Alarcon -de-la-Lastra 2014; \nAparicio -Soto et al. 2014) . Besides, the nuclear factor (erythroid -derived 2) -like 2 (Nrf2), the crucial \nregulator in antio xidant response element (ARE) -driven gene expression in response to oxidative \nstress, leads to the expression of several antioxidant enzymes, such as hem e oxygenase -1 (HO -1), \nwhich are regarded as essential anti -inflammatory targets (Kang and Kim 2013; Li et al. 2014) . \nChapter I  \n \n69 \n Recently, accumulating experimental, clinical and epidemiological data have provided \nsupport to the traditional beliefs of the beneficial effect provided by olive derivatives (Battino et al. \n2018; Pedret et al. 2018) . In this regard, particular attention has been drawn to the secoiridoid \noleuropein (OL) , the ma in phenolic component of olive leaves, roots and unprocessed olive drupes \n(accounting up to 14% of total dry weight), which is hydrolysed during fruit maturation and forms \ndifferent products, including hydroxytyrosol  (HTy) (2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol) (Pan et al. \n2018) . \nOL has been reported as a well -established antioxidant, anti-thrombotic and anti -\natherogenic, hepatoprotective, antiviral, antimicrobial and potential anti -cancer activities (Castej\u00f3n \net al. 2017; Janahmadi et al. 2017; Kremastinos 2008) . Besides, OL has b een also identified as a \npotential molecule with a therapeutic utility against neurodegenerative diseases, including \nParkinson and Alzheimer diseases (Barbaro et al. 2014; Pantano et al. 2017) . Moreover, some studies \nhave documented that OL elicited anti -inflammatory effects inhibiting bios ynthesis of \nproinflammatory  cytokines, lypoxigenase activity and production of leukotriene B4. In fact, OL \nregulated LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 inflammatory response by the suppression of  both iNOS and \nCOX -2 expressions (Ryu et al. 2015) . As well, OL exerted gastr ointestinal benefits preventing \nethanol -induced gastric ulcers via elevation of antioxidant enzyme activities in rats (Alirezaei et al. \n2012)  and decreasing the extent and severity on dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) -induced acute \ncolitis, reducing neutrophil infiltration,  NO,  iNOS, COX -2, proinflammatory  cytokines and \nmetalloproteinase (MMP) -9 protein production, via inhibition of NF -\u03baB p65 subunit nucleus \ntranslocation (Barbaro et al. 2014) . Nevertheless, although OL is rapidly absorbed and distributed \nin animals, its bioavailibity is low  because it is fast metabolized into more polar co mpounds, \nmainly, HTy  (Edgecombe, Stretch, and Hayball 2000) .  \nIn this lin e, some studies have shown the importance of acetyl ated derivatives of natural \nphenols since their lipophilic nature allows them to cross the cytoplasmic cell membranes and their \nuptake by cells, offering a possible  protection of membrane components. Acetyl ation of \npolyphenols may bring improved properties to these molecules, such as, improved bioavailability, \ncell membrane penetration and enhanced anti -inflammatory and antioxidant activities among \nothers (de Ara\u00fajo et al. 2017; Hoang, Huynh, and Nguyen 2015; Rizzo et al. 2017) . Therefore, the \nsynthesis of OL derivatives with better pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic profiles than natural \nOL could be an appealing strategy in the management of the inflammatory process, due to the \nwell -established anti -inflammatory activity of the natural compound.  \nIn t his context, the present study was designed to investigate the potential anti -\ninflammatory activity of three new acetyl ated derivatives synthes ized from OL (1): Peracetylated \nOL (Per-OL); (2); 2\u2019\u2019, 3\u2019\u2019, 4\u2019\u2019, 6\u2019\u2019 -Tetra -O-acetyloleuropein (3); and 6\u2019\u2019 -O-Acetyloleuropein (4), in LPS-Chapter I  \n \n70 \n induced inflammatory response in murine peritoneal macrophages in comparison with natural OL, \nand to clarify the potential underlying molecular mechanisms involved in their effects.  \n \n \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n \n2.1. Reagents  \n \nOL (1) \nThe extraction of  OL (1) was performed following the reported literature (Stamatopoulos, \nChatzilazarou, and Katsoyannos 2013) . Then, the extract was purified by column chromatography \n(CH2Cl2-MeOH 10:1\u21925:1) to give the product as a yellow solid (Figure 1A).  \n \nPer-OL (2) \nOL (1 g, 1.85 mmol) was solved and stirred in a mixture of 1:1 (v/v) pyridine/acetic \nanhydride (8 ml) at 0\u00ba C for 10 min. Then, the reac tion was kept at room temperature overnight. \nAfter hydrolysing the acetic anhydride, the solution was concentrated to dryness resulting a \nresidue that was purified by column chromatography  (EtOAc -C. Hexane 1:1) to give the product \n(quant.) as a brown solid .

Cell membrane permeability and lipophilicity of  OL and its acetyl ated -derivatives  \n \nClogP  has been extensively used to evaluate the lipophilicity of organic molecules, and to \nestimate cell membrane permeability (Lipinski et al. 2001) . The calculated logP, the log arithm of the \npartition coefficient between octan -1-ol and water, were obtained by using ChemBioDraw\u00ae Ultra \n14.0 (Perkin -Elmer Informatics Waltham, MA), one of the best  commercially available chemical \nsoftwares, preferred to HyperChem and ACD/log P (Rice 2014) . \n \n2.3. Animals  \n \nTwenty eight -ten-weeks -old female Swiss mice (20 -30 g) were provided by Harlan \nInterfauna Ib\u00e9rica\u00ae (Barcelona, Spain), randomly distributed in cages (5 mice/cage) and use d as \nsources of peritoneal macrophages. Mice were maintained under constant conditions of \ntemperature (20 -25 \u00b0C) and humidity (40 -60%) with a 12 h light/dark cycle and fed with standard \nrodent chow (Panlab\u00ae A04, Seville, Spain) and water ad libitum  throughout the whole experiment in \nour Animal Laboratory Center (Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Seville, Spain). After one -week \nacclimation, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1 ml of s terile thioglycollate medium (3. 8% \nw/v) (BD Difco\u00ae, Le Pont  de Claix, France). After thioglycollate injection, behavioral observation,  \nwater and food consumptions, loss of body weight and survival were daily monitored until \nsacrifice. After 3 days, mice were euthanized in the laboratory surgical area  by CO 2 exposu re.  \nAll animal care and experimental procedures followed a protocol approved by the Animal \nEthics Committee of the University of Seville, and all experiments were in accordance with the \nrecommendations of the European Union regarding animal experimentatio n (Directive of the \nEuropean Counsel 2010/630/EU).  \n \n2.4. Isolation and culture of murine peritoneal macrophages  \n \nPeritoneal cells were obtained following the protocol described by Aparicio -Soto et al., \n2015 (Aparicio -Soto et al. 2015) . Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in RPMI 1640 \nmedium (PAA\u00ae, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% heat -inactivated foetal calf serum \n(FCS) (PAA\u00ae, Pasching, Austria), L -glutamine (2 mM), glucose (4.5 g/l), and HEPES buffer (10 \nmM), in the presence of 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin (PAA\u00ae, Pasching, \nAustria) and seeded in culture plates for 2 h at 37\u00ba C in a 5% CO 2 humidi\ufb01ed atmosphere. After  2 h, \ncells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS) and fresh RPMI 1640 medium without \nfetal bovine serum (FB S) containing different concentrations of assayed compounds (1 -4). After 30  \nmin, murine peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with 5 \u00b5g /ml of LPS from Escherichia Coli  \n(Sigma -Aldrich\u00ae, St Louis, MO, US) in presence or absence of OL or its derivatives (2 -4) (25 and 50 \n\u00b5M) for 18 h.  Chapter I  \n \n73 \n OL, (2), (3) and (4) were always freshly prepar ed as stock solutions in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) \n(Panreac\u00ae, Barcelona, Spain) and diluted to the desired concentration in the culture medium. The \nfinal concentration of DMSO in the culture medium was \u2264 1% in all experiments and it had not \nsignificantly influence cell response.  \n \n2.5. Cell viability  \n \nCells (1x105 cells/well) were incubated in presence or absence of OL or its derivatives for \n18 h. The effects of  OL and (2), (3) and (4) on cell viability were analyzed by sulforhodamine B \n(SRB) assay (Skehan et al. 1990) . After 18 h, macrophages were fixed in situ  by adding 50 \u03bcL of 50% \n(w/v) cold trichloroacetic acid (Sigma -Aldrich\u00ae, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated for 60 min at \n4\u00b0C. Supernatants were discarded, and plates were washed four times with deionized water and \ndried. After that, 50 \u03bcL of SRB (Sigma -Aldrich\u00ae, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution (0,4% w/v) in 1% \nacetic acid (Panre ac\u00ae, Barcelona, Spain) was added in each well and incubated for 30 min at room  \ntemperature. Then, plates were washed with 1% acetic acid and air dried. Finally, 100 \u03bcL per well \nof 10 mmol/L Tris base pH 10,5 (Sigma -Aldrich\u00ae, St. Louis, MO, USA) were added , and the \nabsorbance was read on an enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader at 510 nm \n(BioTek\u00ae, Bad Friedrichshall,  Germany). Cell survival was measured as the percentage of \nabsorbance compared with that obtained in control cells (non -treated cell s). In each experiment, \nviability was always \u2265 95 %.  \n \n2.6. Measurement of intracellular ROS  \n \nIntracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production was measured using 2,7 -\ndichlorofluorescein -diacetate (DCFH -DA). DCFH -DA penetrates into the macrophages and is \nhydrolyzed by intracellular esterases to the nonfluorescent 2,7 -dichlorofluorescein (DCFH), which \ncan be rapidly oxidized to the highly fluorescent 2,7 -dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in the presence of \nROS. Isolated murine peritoneal macrophages were seeded at 106 cells per well in dark bottom 24 -\nwell plates and were incubated in the absence or presence of OL and its derivatives (2 -4) and 30 \nmin later, cells were stimulated with LPS for 18 h. After the incubation time, cells were treated with \n25 \u00b5M DCFH -DA at 37\u00b0 C for 45 min and washed once with buffer. The fluorescence intensity was \nmeasured with a plate reader (BioTek\u00ae, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany) with an excitation \nwavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm. The results were expressed as the \nintracellular ROS production percentage compared with LPS -DMSO control cells. H 2O2 (50 \u00b5M) \n(Sigma Aldrich\u00ae, Barcelona, Spain) was used as the pro -oxidant positive control. The fluorescence \nintensity was measured as described previously by C\u00e1rdeno  et al., 2014 (Cardeno, Sanchez -\nHidalgo, Aparicio -Soto, Sanchez -Fidalgo, et al. 2014) . \n Chapter I  \n \n74 \n 2.7. Measurement of nitrites production  \n \nCells in 24 -well plate were treated with different concentrations of OL or its derivatives (2 -\n4) (25 and 50 \u00b5M), and 30 min later stimulated with LPS for 18 h. The culture supernatants were \ntransferred into a 96 -well assay plate, mixed with Griess reagent (Sigma - Aldrich\u00ae, St Louis, MO, \nUSA) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The amount of nitrite, as an index of NO \ngeneration, was determined and obtained by extrapolation from a standard curve with sodium \nnitrite. The absorbance at 540 nm was mea sured by an ELISA reader (BioTek\u00ae, Bad Friedrichshall, \nGermany). Results were expressed as the nitrite production percentage compared with DMSO -LPS \ncells (stimulated untreated cells).   \n \n2.8. Cytokine assay  \n \nThe levels of  PGE 2 and  IL -1\u03b2, TNF -\u03b1, IL -6, IL -17 and  IFN -\u03b3 cytokines were determined in \ncell- culture supernatants using appropriate commercial ELISA kits for the appropriate form of  \nthese parameters (Diaclone\u00ae, Besan\u00e7on, Cedex, France; Cayman Chemical Company\u00ae, Ann Arbo r, \nMI, USA). The results were expressed in pg/ml.  \n \n2.9. Isolation of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins and immunoblotting detection  \n \nCells (1\u00d7106 cells/ ml) were treated with OL or its derivatives and stimulated with LPS for \n18 h. After incubation, cells were rinsed, scraped off and collected in ice -cold PBS containing a \ncocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors and processed as described by S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo et \nal., 2005 (S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo et al. 2005) . Protein concentration was measured for each sample using a \nprotein assay reagent (BioRad\u00ae, CA, USA) according to the Bradford\u00b4s method and using \u03b3-\nglobuline as a standard. Aliquots of supernatant contains equal amount of protein (15 \u00b5g) were \nseparated on 10% acryl amide gel by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacryamide gel electrophoresis, \nelectrophoretically transferred into a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with specific primary \nantibodies: rabbit anti -COX -2 and rabbit anti -iNOS (Cayman\u00ae, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) (1:25 00 and \n1:1000, respectively), mouse anti -pSTAT3 (Cell Signaling  Technology\u00ae, Danvers, MA, USA) \n(1:1000), mouse anti -pJNK, rabbit anti -JNK, mouse anti -pp38, rabbit anti -p38 (Cell Signaling  \nTechnology\u00ae, Danvers, MA, USA) (1:1000), rabbit polyclonal anti p -ERK and mouse anti -ERK\u00bd \n(Cell Signaling  Technology\u00ae, Danvers, MA , USA),  rabbit anti -HO1 and rabbit anti -Nrf2 (Cell \nSignaling  Technology\u00ae, Danvers, MA, USA) (1:500), overnight at 4\u00baC. After rinsing, the membranes \nwere incubated with a horseradish peroxidase -labeled (HRP) secondary antibody anti -rabbit \n(Cayman Chemical\u00ae, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) (1:50000) or anti -mouse (Dako\u00ae, Atlanta, GA, USA) \n(1:2000) containing blocking solution for 1 -2 h at room temperature. To prove equal loading, the \nblots were ana lyzed for \u03b2 -actin expression using an anti -\u03b2-actin antibody (Sigma Aldrich\u00ae, MO, \nUSA). Immunodetection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence light -detecting kit Chapter I  \n \n75 \n (Pierce\u00ae, Rockford, IL, USA). The immunosignals were captured using Amersham Imager 60 0 \nfrom GE Healthcare\u00ae (Buckinghamshire,US) and densitometric data were studied following \nnormalization to the house -keeping loading control. The signals were analyzed and quantified by \nan Image Processing and Analysis in Java (Image J, Softonic\u00ae) and expre ssed in relation to the \nDMSO -LPS treated cells.  \n \n2.10.  Statistical evaluation  \n \nAll values in the figures and text are expressed as arithmetic means \u00b1 standard error \n(S.E.M). Experiments were carried out in triplicate. Data were evaluated with Graph Pad Prism\u00ae \nVersion 6.01 software (San Diego, CA, USA). The statistical significance of any difference in each \nparameter among the groups was evaluated by one -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using \nTukey\u00b4s multiple comparisons test as post hoc test. P values of < 0.05 were considered statistically \nsignificant. In the experiments involving densitometry, the figures shown are representative of at \nleast three different experiments performed on different days.  \n \n3. RESULTS  \n \n3.1. Effects of chemical acetylation in the lipophilicity of OL and its acetylated derivatives  \n \nSelective enzymatic monoacetylation of the primary hydroxyl group of OL resulted in a \nsmall increase of ClogP values, which go from 0.587 for OL to 0.833 for its monoacetyl derivative. \nOn the contrary, the derivatives with the acetylated glucose moiety showed a considerable increase \nin lipophilicity, with values of 2.727 and 2.509, for the tetra -O-acetyl and hexa -O-acetyl derivatives, \nrespectively. The increased lipophilicity by acetyl ation may play significant role in the absorption \nof a compound in the gastrointestinal track, and in its subsequent metabolism in liver.  \n \n3.2. OL and its ac etylated derivatives do not compromise murine macrophages survival  \n \nWe first assessed the impact of OL and its ac etylated derivatives on murine peritoneal \nmacrophages by SRB survival assay. After 18 h of incubation with the compounds, the viability of \ncells treated with (1), (2), (3) or (4) was not significantly compromised at concentrations from 50 to \n200 \u00b5M (Data not shown). However, conc entrations lower than 25 \u00b5M produced a decrease of cell \nviability to less than 80%. Therefore, we decided to assay the compounds at concentrations from 25 \nto 50 \u00b5M in forthcoming experiments.  \n \n3.3. OL and its ac etylated derivatives inhibit LPS -induced intracell ular reactive oxygen species \n(ROS) production in murine peritoneal macrophages  \n Chapter I  \n \n76 \n Free radicals of oxygen are suggested to be signaling  messengers in the LPS -mediated \ninflammatory response. So, we tested the effects of OL and its ac etylated -derivatives on LP S-\ninduced intracellular ROS production using a DCFH -SA assay. As shown in Figure 2, cells \nincubated with ac etylated OL derivatives treatments of for 18 h exhibited significant decreases in \nintracellular ROS production. Similar results were f ound in OL -treated cells.  (*** p<0.001 vs. \nuntreated cells; ++p<0.01 and +++p<0.001 vs. DMSO -LPS control cells) .  \n \n \nFigure 2. Intracellular ROS generation was reduced by OL and its derivatives.  Cells were incubated \nwith OL and its derivatives (25 and 50 \u00b5M) for 18 h. Then, cells were harvested and incubated with 25 \u00b5M of \nDCFH -DA for 45 min at 37\u00ba C in the dark. Results were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity obtained \u00b1 \nS.E.M. (n=6). *** p<0.001 vs. untreated cells; ++p<0.01; +++p<0.001 vs. DMSO -treated control cells.  H 2O2 (C+) was \nused as the pro -oxidant positive control.   \n \n3.4. OL and its acetylated derivatives countered nitric oxide production, downregulated iNOS and \nCOX -2 overexpression and p roduction of PGE 2 induced by LPS in murine peritoneal \nmacrophages  \n \nCells were cultured for 30 min in the presence or absence of OL or its derivatives at \nconcentrations of 25 and 50 \u00b5M and then stimulated for 18 h. As expected, the stimulation with LPS \ninduce d strong production of NO (*** p<0.001 vs. untreated cells). On the contrary, pre -treatment \nwith OL or its ac etylated derivatives effectively prevented the NO mediated induction (++p<0.01 \nand +++p<0.001 vs. DMSO -treated control cells) (Fig. 3A). These  data suggested that ac etylated OL \nderivatives could downregulate iNOS enzyme activity, which was further confirmed by measuring \niNOS protein expression. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that OL derivatives exhibited a \nsignificant inhibition of the LPS -induced iNOS expression at both 25 and 50 \u00b5M, which a higher \nChapter I  \n \n77 \n reduction on  iNOS protein expression compared with OL (***p<0.001 vs. untreated cells; +p<0.05; \n++p<0.01 and +++p<0.001 vs. DMSO -LPS control cells)  (Fig. 3B).  \nWe investigated the possible effect of OL and its ac etylated derivatives on COX -2 and \nPGE 2 inflammation -related biomarkers. As expected, LPS stimulation remarkably increased COX -2 \nprotein expression (Fig. 3B) and PGE 2 levels (Fig. 3C), whereas OL treatment or its ac etylated \nderivative s (25 and 50 \u00b5M) evoked a significant down -regulation of COX -2 expression and \namelioration of PGE 2 in LPS -stimulated peritoneal macrophages (***p<0.001 vs. untreated cells; \n+p<0.05, ++p<0.01 and +++p<0.001 vs. DMSO -LPS control cells) . \n \n \n \nChapter I  \n \n78 \n Figure 3.

OL and its acetylated derivatives on cytokine production  \n \nWe further explored whether OL or its ac etylated derivatives could modify the production \nof helper T cells ( Th)-1/Th2/Th17 cytokines.

However, OL treatment was not able to decrease TNF -\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL -17 levels. On \nthe contrary, IL-6, IL -1\u03b2 , IFN-\u03b3  and IL -17 levels were diminished after  OL derivative ( 3) \ntreatment;  Similarly, compound (4) could decrease IL -6, IL -1\u03b2 , TNF -\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 levels and  finally  \nthe derivative (2) significantly r educed the production of all the tested  Th1 and Th17  pro - \ninflammatory cytokines showing  the best  anti -inflammatory profile at the assayed concentrations \n(25 and 50 \u00b5M) in a dose -dependent manner  (Fig. 4) (*** p<0.001 vs. untreated cells; +p<0.05, \n++p<0.01 and +++p<0.001 vs. DMSO -LPS control cells) . \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter I  \n \n79 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

OL and its acetylated derivatives on LPS-induced MAPKS  activation in murine peritoneal \nmacrophages  \n \nTo explore the molecular mechanism underlying the previously observed anti -\ninflammatory effects, we evaluated whether OL derivatives were able to influence janus NH 2-\nterminal kinase ( JNK ), extracellular signal -regulated kinases ( ERK ), and p38 phosphor ylati on by \nwestern blot . 18 h after LPS stimulation, OL derivatives demonstrated to be able to inhibit \nsignificantly ERK, JNK and p38 activation, showing better results in comparison wi th the natural \ncompound (Fig.  6 ) (*p<0.05; *** p<0.001 vs. untreated cells; +p<0.05, ++p<0.01 and +++p<0.001 vs. \nDMSO -LPS control cells) .  \nChapter I  \n \n80 \n  \n \n \nFigure 5.

OL and its acetylated derivatives on Janus kinase -signal transducer and activator of \ntranscription ( JAK/STAT ) pathway and Nrf2 -mediated transcriptional activation and HO -1 \ninduction in LPS murine peritoneal macrophages  \n \nIn our study, LPS stimulation produced an increase of STAT -3 phosphorylation when \ncompared with non -stimulated cells. On the contrary, (2) and (3 ) OL derivatives exhibited \nsignificant effects in the prevention of the induced phosphorylation of STAT -3, showing better \nresults that those described after treatment with their  pattern (Fig. 6A) (* p<0.05 vs. untreated cells; \n+p<0.05 vs. DMSO -LPS control cells) . \nTo identify whether ac etylated OL derivatives were effective on regulation of Nrf2, we investigated \nthe protein expression of Nrf2 and HO -1 by western blot. As shown in Figure 6B, OL  derivatives \ncaused a significantly increase on LPS -induced Nrf2 and HO -1 expression levels, which were \nChapter I  \n \n81 \n markedly higher compared with data from OL treated cells (+p<0.05, ++p<0.01 and +++p<0.001 vs. \nDMSO -LPS control cells) . The increment of HO -1 and Nrf2 protein expression was according to the \nreduction of ROS production that we could observe in Fig. 2. Thus, both parameters highlighted the \nantioxidant potential of these compounds.  \n \n \n \nFigure 6.

DISCUSSION  \n \nCurrently, natural products still play an essential role in healthcare, providing a countless \nsource of potential components for drug synthesis and development (Cragg and Newman 2013) . \nThe results of the present study showed, for the first time, that three new ac etylated OL derivatives \nexhibited significant anti -inflammatory activities and attenuated the oxidative events induced by \nLPS in murine peritoneal macrophages, exhibiting better results than the observed with original \ncompound OL. Among them, Per-OL (2) displayed the most effective anti -inflammatory behavior. \nThese dat a are in agreement with previous in vitro  studies, where OL showed anti -inflammatory \neffects in LPS -stimulated RAW 264.7 cells  (Ryu et al. 2015) . Likewise, other olive phenols such as \nHTy  and peracetylated hydroxytyrosol (Per-HTy) (Montoya et al. 2018) , hydroxytyrosol acetate  \n(HTy -Ac) and its  derivatives with better hydrophilic/ lipophilic balance, exhibited strong anti -\ninflammatory effects in LPS -stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages (Aparicio -Soto et al. 2015) .  \nA good balance of cell permeability and aqueous solubility, for optimal gastrointestinal \nabsorption of a drug, has been suggested to be in the range of 0 <logP< 3.  Therefore, OL and its \nthree acetyl ated derivatives fulfil this requirement, although for compound  (2) with the acetylated \nglucose moiety should have better cell permeability, in accordance with the excellent results \nobserved in in vitro  assay s (Kerns and Di 2008) . \nBalance disruption of the intracellular reduction -oxidation state has been observed in \nstimulated macrophages, which leads to oxidative stress characterized by a major shift in the \ncellular redox balance and usually accompanied by ROS -mediated damage. In fact, the new \nsecoiridoid ac etylated derivatives were able to reduce ROS levels acting as effective anti -oxidants.  \nThus, modulators of ROS production and ROS -induced signaling  pathways, especially in \nmacrophages, could represent potential strategies for anti -inflammatory intervention. Our findings \nare in concordance with other studies in which OL showed a strong antioxidant effects in a similar \nrange tested in our study (50 -100 \u00b5M). Also, other olive polyphenols like HTy  showed  important \nantioxidant effects acting as free radicals scavengers (Granados -Principal et al. 2011) . \nLPS-stimulated macrophages are closely related to an imbalance of cytokine network. It is \nwell known that this kind of inflammatory pro cess is characterized by an increase of Th1 and Th17 \nproinflammatory  cytokines mainly, TNF -\u03b1, IL -1\u03b2, IL -6, and IFN -\u03b3 and IL -17 respectively.  \nOur results showed that  OL and its derivatives inhibited distinct types of cytokines.   In \nfact, the treatment with  OL significantly reduced both IL -6 and IL -1\u03b2 cytokines in culture medium \nin agreement with a previous study (Ryu et al. 2015) . However, TNF -\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL -17 levels  were \nnot decreased after OL treatment. On the contrary, IL-6, IL -1\u03b2 , IFN-\u03b3  and IL-17 levels were \ndiminished by OL derivative ( 3), compound (4) could decrease IL -6, IL -1\u03b2 , TNF -\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 levels \nand  finally, the derivative (2) significantly reduced the production of all tested  Th1 and Th17 Chapter I  \n \n83 \n proinflammatory  cytokines showing the best  anti-inflammatory profile at the assayed \nconcentrations (25 and 50 \u00b5M) in a dose -dependent manner. Hence, it is possible that the \nacetyl ation of aliphatic hydroxyl groups in OL leads to an increase of its lipophilic profile, \nexplaining the improvement of the induced cytokines network exhibited after derivatives tested \ncomparison with their natural pattern, OL.  \nThe exposure of peritoneal macrophages to LPS induces the transcription of the iNOS \ngene and generation of large amounts of NO (Cardeno, Sanchez -Hidalgo, Aparicio -Soto, Sanchez -\nFidalgo, et al. 2014) . In the present study NO levels and iNOS expression were decreased by OL \ntreatment.  Similar data were reported by  Ryu et al., 2015 in RAW 264.7 cells (Ryu et al. 2015) . \nMoreover, compounds (2), (3) and (4) at 25 and 50 \u00b5M produced a stronger reduction of both NO \nlevels and iNOS protein expression when compared t o OL (1).  \n COX -2 , the inducible isoform of COX is essential for the inflammatory response and is \nresponsible for the overproduction of  PGE 2 in inflammation (Cardeno, Sanchez -Hidalgo, Aparicio -\nSoto, Sanchez -Fidalgo, et al. 2014) . Likewise, PGE 2 modulates a variety of immune processes at sites \nof inflammation, including  production of proinflammatory  cytokines (Imig, Breyer, and Breyer \n2002) . Our results showed that LPS stimulus upregulated COX -2 protein expression and increas ed \nPGE 2 levels in murine peritoneal macrophages in concordance with  previous studies by Ap aricio -\nSoto et al., 201 4 (Aparicio -Soto et al. 2014)  and C\u00e1 rdeno et al., 2014 (Carden o, Sanchez -Hidalgo, \nAparicio -Soto, Sanchez -Fidalgo, et al. 2014) . However, both parameters were significantly \ndecreased by OL and its derivatives treatment in a dose -dependent manner , at doses assayed (25 \nand 50 \u00b5M).  \nAccording to the literature, MAPKs  pathway is a critical axis essential for both induction \nand propagation of the inflammatory LPS -activated macrophage response (Radnai et al. 2009) . \nMAPKs  include ERK -1 and -2, JNK  and p38 MAPKS . The increase activity of MAPKs  as well as \ntheir involvement in the regulation of the inflammation mediator synthesis a t the transcription \nlevel and translation make them potential targets for anti -inflammatory therapy (Cardeno, \nSanchez -Hidalgo, Aparicio -Soto, and Alarcon -de-la-Lastra 2014) . In effect, MAPKs  have been \nshow n to play crucial  roles in iNOS  and COX -2 upregulation induced by various stimuli in \nmammalian cells (Guha and Mackman 2001) . Our  study showed that LPS evoked a significant \nincrement of the p38, JNK and ERK (1/2) MAPKS  phosphorylation, in peritoneal macrophages \nafter 18 h of stimulation. In contrast, OL treatment and  its ac etylated derivatives (25 and 50 \u00b5M) \nreduced MAPKs  phosphorylation, which was consistent with previous studies reporting that OL \ninhibited MAPKs  activation in RAW 264.7 cells (Ryu et al. 2015)  and in human osteoarthritis \nchondrocytes (Feng et al. 2017) . \nMoreover, MAPKs  are also involved in the activation of JAK/STAT,  an important \nsignal ing transduction  pathway  for the biological function of many cytokines. In fact, t he Chapter I  \n \n84 \n transcription factor STAT -3 is activated by many cytokines allowing to STAT3 dimers translocate to \nthe nucleus and stimulate transcription  mediating the synthesis of infla mmatory mediators  such as  \nTh1 and Th17 cytokines (Zhu e t al. 2013) . Our results are in agreement with previous studies \nreporting that OL treatment attenuated the induced activation of STAT -3  in a murine colitis -\nassociated  colorectal cancer model (Giner et al. 2016) . Besides, (2) and (3) OL derivatives also \nexhibited significant effects in the prevention of the induced phosphorylation of STAT -3, showing \nbetter results that the described after the treatment with the par ent. Altogether, our data suggest \nthat all tested compounds present a potential anti -inflammatory effect mediated in part by STAT -3 \ninactivation.  \nNrf2, is a redox -sensitive transcription factor and binds to ARE  located in the promoter \nregions of many detox ifying/antioxidant genes, including HO -1 (Bang et al. 2012) . In the presence \nof oxidative stress, Nrf2 could migrate to the nucleus, bind to the oxidant response element \nsequence, and induce phase II gene transcription resulting in a cytoprotective response \ncharacterized by up regulation  of HO -1 among others, and decreased sensitivity to oxidative stress \ndamage. In inflammatory conditions, HO -1 expression protein could be part of an adaptive \nmechanism to limit cytotoxicity via several mechanisms including scavenging of ROS and nitrogen \nspecies, regulation of cell proliferation and prevention of apoptosis. Thus, Nrf2 regulates redox \nstatus and plays key roles in cellular defence by enhancing ROS remove (Rosi llo et al. 2015) . Our \nresults in concordance with Aparicio -Soto et al., 2015 (Aparicio -Soto et al. 2015) , showed that LPS \nstimulation decreased Nrf2 and HO -1 expression. On the contrary, OL derivatives treatments (25 \nand 50 \u00b5M) were able to increase these reduced expressions of Nrf2 and HO -1 induced by LPS, but \nwe did not observed any significant changes in the expression of HO -1 and Nrf2 after the treatment \nwith the original compound. Altogether, our data suggest that ac etylated OL derivatives present \nalso a potential antioxidant effect which is mediated by Nrf2/HO1 antioxidant signaling pathway.  \nIn conclusi on, this study showed, for the first time, the new ac etylated OL derivatives (2), \n(3) and (4) have an important role in the balance of the inflammatory microenvironment  induced \nby LPS in murine peritoneal macrophages by inhibiting proinflammatory  cytokines  production, \nsuch as IL -1\u03b2, TNF -\u03b1, IL -6, IL -17 and IFN -\u03b3, as well as iNOS and COX -2 over expressions. The \nmechanisms underlying these protective effects could be related via the Nrf2/HO -1 antioxidant \npathway activa tion and inhibition of both JAK/STAT and M APKs  signaling  pathways. \nFurthermore, these new synthetic OL derivatives exhibit a better anti -inflammatory profile that the \nnatural compound OL, that could be due to their better pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics \nprofiles related to the modification of the ir chemical structure . Thereby, these new OL derivatives \nmay offer a new promising therapeutic strategy in the management of inflammatory related \npathologies, which needs to be further investigated. It could be a useful option to increase the \nquality of li fe of patients with these types of diseases, probably as a dietary supplement.

En la AR, los FS o sinoviocitos de \ntipo fibrobl \u00e1stico juegan un papel fundamental en la persistencia de la inflamaci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica y el \nda\u00f1o articular siendo unas de las poblaciones celulares m\u00e1s abundantes en el pannus , tejido de \ngranulaci\u00f3n localmente invasivo implicado en la degradaci\u00f3n del cart\u00edlago y destrucci\u00f3n \u00f3sea.  \nLa oleurope\u00edna ( OL) es el compuesto fen\u00f3lico m\u00e1s abundante en las hojas del \u00e1rbol del olivo, las \nsemillas y la pulpa y la piel de las aceitunas verdes. Adem\u00e1s, la OL es la responsable del \ncaracter\u00edstico sabor amargo de las aceitunas cuan do a\u00fan est\u00e1n sin procesar. Existen numerosas \npropiedades farmac\u00f3logicas que se le atribuyen a la OL, incluida su capacidad antioxidante y anti -\ninflamatoria, lo que le confiere  la capacidad de ser considerada  como un suplemento alimentario en \nlos pa\u00edses med iterr\u00e1neos.  \nLas dianas de las terapias actuales de la AR se dirigen fundamentalmente contra  c\u00e9lulas T, c\u00e9lulas B \no citoquina s macrof\u00e1gicas. Con estas terapias se consigue un retardo de la progresi\u00f3n de la \nenfermedad y de la destrucci\u00f3n articular que produc e, sin embargo, presentan limitaciones en \neficacia y seguridad para los pacientes con AR. Por ello, en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os surde la necesidad de \nbuscar otras estrategias terap\u00e9uticas para el abordaje de la AR, como la terapia nutricional y el uso \nde nutrac\u00e9ut icos.  \nEn base a estos antecedentes, nos plantemos evaluar el efecto de la OL en la producci\u00f3n de \nmediadores pro -inflamatorios y estr\u00e9s oxidativo en una l\u00ednea celular de fibroblastos humanos \n(SW982) estimulados con interleuc ina ( IL)-1\u03b2 y dilucidar los mecanismos de se\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n \nintracelular y v\u00edas de se\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n que estuvieran posiblemente implicados.  \nPara llevar a cabo este estudio se utiliz\u00f3 la l\u00ednea celular de fibroblastos humanos SW982, \nestimulados con IL -1\u03b2 (5ng/mL).

It is accompanied by a \nmassive infiltration of inflammatory immune cells  inducing progr essive matrix degradation, \ndestruction of cartilage and bone erosion through the production of inflammatory mediators. \nOleuropein, is the most prevalent phenolic component in olive leaves, seed, pulp and peel of \nunripe olives and is responsible for unproce ssed olives characteristic bitter taste. This secoiridoid \npossesses a well -documented  pharmacological properties, including antioxidant and anti -\ninflammatory , consequently is available as food supplement in Mediterranean countries. However, \nat the date, an ti-arthritic effects of OL on SFs have not been yet elucidated.  Thus,  the aim of the \npresent study was to investigate the potential effects of OL, on interleukin ( IL)-1\u03b2-induced \nproduction of inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress in human synovial s arcoma cell line \n(SW982).  In order to gain a better insight into mechanisms of action, signaling  pathways were also \nexplored.  \nCell viability was determined using sulfhorodamine B (SRB) assay. The expre ssion of inflammatory \ncytokines IL-6, tumor necrosis factor ( TNF )-\u03b1, metalloproteinase s (MMP )-1 and MMP -3 was \nevaluated by ELISA. Moreover, changes in the protein expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX -2), \nmicrosomal prostaglandin E synthase -1 (mPGES -1) as well as mitogen -activated protein kinase \n(MAPKs), nucle ar factor kappa B (NF -\u03baB), and nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related ( Nrf2) and heme \noxigenase -1 (HO-1) signaling  pathways were analysed by Western B lotting.  \nOL exerted anti -inflammatory and anti -oxidant effects via  down -regulation of MAPKs and NF -\u03baB \nsignaling  pathways and  induction of Nrf2 -linked HO -1 controlling the production of inflammatory \nmediators decreasing IL -6 and TNF -\u03b1 cytokines, MMP -1 and  MMP -3 levels as well as mPGES -1 \nand COX -2 overexpression. Thus, OL might provide a basis for developi ng a new dietary strategy \nfor the prevention and management of RA.  \nKeywords : HO-1, MAPKs, Nrf2, NF -\u03baB, rheumatoid arthritis, synovial fibroblasts.  \nChapter II \n \n93 \n  \n \n \n \n1. INTRODUCTION  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory joint disease with systemic involvement  \nthat affects about 1% of the world\u2019s population  (Meinecke et al. , 2005) , which is characterized by \nleukocyte recruitment and acti vation, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and pannus  formation \nultimately resulting in  bone erosion,  deformity and joint destruction. At a joint level, there are \nsynovial hyperplasia and massive infiltration of immune cells, including cluster of differentiation \n(CD)4+ T-cells, B -cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells  (DC) , neutrophils and mast \ncells (Ganesan and Rasool, 2017) . \nAlthough the cause of RA has not been fully elucidated, increasing evidences indicate that \nsynovial fibroblasts (SFs) have an important role in the loss of cartilage tissue integrity  (Zhao et al. , \n2016) .  In healthy joint, SFs play a homeostatic role, since they are implicated in the maintenance of \njoint health, controlling the composition of the synovial tissue, extracellular matrix and synovial \nfluid  (Bhattaram and Chandrasekharan, 2017) . In arthritic joint, SFs transform from joint -protecting \ncells into joint -destroying cells, RA -SFs proliferate rapidly, and produce growth factors and pro -\nangiogenic factors that increase the local vascular network. In addition, they are highly migratory. \nThey attach to the articular cartilage, produce cartilage matrix -degrading enzymes, and once \ncartilage is eroded, they invade the underlying bone and activate osteoclast -mediated bone \nresorption.  Therefore, SFs constitute one of the major cell populations for the investigation of the \npathogenes is and treatment of RA. In fact, controlling oxidative stress and the inflammatory \nChapter I I \n 94 \n responses of SFs is a promising s trategy for the treatment of RA  (Bottini and Firestein, 2013; Lefevre \net al. , 2014) . \nSFs produce large amounts of pro -inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL) -1\u03b2, IL -6, \nIL-8, IL-33, tumor necrosis factor (TNF )-\u03b1 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade \ncartilage thereby contributing to joint destruction   (Palmer et al. , 2009; Cooles and Isaacs, 2011; \nKloesch et al. , 2013) . Among MMPs, MMP -1 and MMP -3 have been reported to be the major \nenzymes produced by fibroblasts and macrophage -like cel ls in the synovium, and that the levels of \nboth MMP -1 and MMP -3 are significantly higher in synovial fluids from patients with RA  \n(Yoshihara et al. , 2000) .  \nIt\u2019s well known that pro -inflammatory cytokines suc h as IL -1\u03b2 and IL -6 stimulate production \nof MMPs through the activation of cellular signaling  pathways involving mitogen -activated protein \nkinases (MAPKs) which comprises extracellular signal -regulated kinases (ERK1/2 or p42/p44), c -\nJun N H2-terminal kinase s (JNK) 1/2/3.  MAPKs phosphorylate selected intracellular proteins, \nincluding transcription factors, which subsequently regulate gene expression by transcriptional and \nposttranscriptional mechanisms  (Chen et al. , 2016) . \nIn particular, nuclear factor kappa B (NF -\u03baB) plays an important role in MMPs induction and \nalso modulates an extensive range of genes that contribute to inflammation, such as microsomal \nprostaglandin E synthase -1 (mPGES -1), an efficient downstream enzyme co -localized and \nfunctionally coupled with the inducibl e enzymes cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2). Both, COX -2 and \nmPGES -1, are up -regulated and responsible for the overproduction of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) \nwhich may affect joint integrity through prostaglan E2 receptor 4 ( EP4) receptor activation  (McCoy, \nWicks and Audoly, 2002; Xiao et al., 2016) .  \nIn addition, in the pathogenesis of RA, there is a close correlation between oxidative stress and \nprogression of inflammation and bone destruction of inflamed joints of RA patients  (Jikimoto et al. , \n2002) . Nuclear factor -erythroid 2 -related factor2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor orchestrator of \nthe induction of several a ntioxidant enzymes s uch as heme oxygen ase-1 (HO -1). It has been \nreported that HO -1 deficiency in mice results in a chronic inflammatory state  (Rosillo et al. , 2014) . \nAlso deletion of the N rf2 gene increases vulnerability to the pathological joint changes associated \nwith adjuvant -induced arthritis  (Maicas et al. , 2011) . \nDietary rich in phenolic compounds, which are typically included in M editerranean diet \nthrough extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), fruits and wine, have shown a wide range of bioactive \nproperties including anti -oxidant, anti-cancer, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti -atherogenic, \nhypoglycemic, hepatic -, cardiac - and neuro -protective , anti-inflammatory and anti -arthritic effects  \n(C\u00e1rdeno, S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo and Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra, 2013; Rosillo et al. , 2016) . \nSpecifically, oleuropein  (OL) , a secoiridoid , is considered as the most prevalent phenolic \ncomponent in olive leaves, seed, pulp and peel of unripe olives (up to 14% of the dry weight). Chapter II \n \n95 \n During fruit maturation, OL undergoes hydrolysis, yielding different products, including \nhydroxytyrosol (HTy) (2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol)  (Gha nbari et al. , 2012) . \nPrevious studies have reported important anti -inflammatory properties of this secoiridoid. In \nfact, OL was able to suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated RAW 264 by the suppression of \ninducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and  COX -2 (Ryu et al. , 2015) . \nAs well, OL have been exerted gastrointestinal benefits preventing ethanol -induced gastric \nulcers via elevation of antioxidants enzyme activities in rats  (Alirezaei et al. , 2012)  and decreasing \nthe extent and severity on dextrane sulphate s odium (DSS) -induced acute colitis, reducing \nneutrophil infiltration, nitric oxide (NO) production, pro -inflammatory cytokines, iNOS, COX -2 \nand MMP -9 protein expression and NF -\u03baB-p65 subunit translocation to the nucleus  (Giner et al., \n2011) . Moreover, OL has been shown significantly to exert a protective effect on cartilage slowing \ndown the progression of spontaneous osteoarthritis lesions in guinea pigs  (Horcajada et al. , 2015) . \nAdditionally, treat ment  with OL-aglycone,  a hydrolysis product obtained from OL by the action \nof \u03b2-glucosidase on the parent glucoside was able to ameliorate the development of the clinical \nsigns and improved histological status in the joint and paw from collagen -induced a rthritis (CIA) \nmice  decreasing  the degree of oxidative and nitrosative damage  (Impellizzeri et al. , 2011) . \nHowever, at the date, anti -arthritic effects of OL on SFs have not been yet elucidated. The \nSW982 human synovial sarcoma cell line, is an useful in vitro tool to study inflammation in \narthritis, and is characterized by the expression of  inflammatory cytokines, MMPs, and other \ninflammatory mediators in res ponse to IL -1\u03b2 (Yamazaki et al. , 2003)  \nThus taking this background into account, the aim of the pre sent study was to investigate the \npotential effects of OL, on IL -1\u03b2-induced production of inflammatory mediators and oxidative \nstress in human synovial sarcoma cell line (SW982).  In order to gain a better insight into \nmechanisms of action, signaling  pathw ays were also explored.  \n \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n \n2.1. Extraction and purification of O L \n \nThe extraction of OL (Figure 1) was performed from leaves samples collected in January \n2014 from Picual cultivar ( Olea europaea  L.), cultivated in Seville  (Spain). The leaves were dried at \nroom temperature and the extraction of  OL was made using aqueous EtOH 70% (v/v) as reported  \n(Stamatopoulos, Katsoyannos and Chatzilazarou, 2014) . \nThe evaporation of the solvent under vacuum gave a powder that was purified by column \nchromatography in CH 2Cl2-MeOH (10:1 \u2192 5:1) resulting in OL as a yellow solid. Spectroscopy data \nwas in agreement with those reported literature  (Procopio et al. , 2009) . 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CD 3OD) \n\u03b4 7.52 (s, 1H, H -3), 6.99 (d, 1H, J7\u2019.8\u2019 = 8.0 Hz, H -7\u2019), 6.67 (d, J4\u2019,8\u2019 = 2.0 Hz, H -4\u2019), 6.55 (dd , 1H, H -8\u2019), \n6.09 (q, 1H, J8,10 = 7.0 Hz, H -8), 5.92 (bs, 1H, H -1), 4.81 (d, 1H, J1\u2019\u2019,2\u2019\u2019 = 7.6 Hz, H -1\u2019\u2019), 4.22, 4.11 (2dt, Chapter I I \n 96 \n 1H each, J1\u2019a,1\u2019b  = 10.7 Hz, J1\u2019,2\u2019 = 7.0 Hz, H -1\u2019), 3.98 (dd, 1H, J5,6b = 9.0 Hz, J5,6a = 4.4 Hz, H -5), 3.89 \n(dd, 1H, J6\u2019\u2019a,6\u2019\u2019b  = 11.5 Hz, J6\u2019\u2019a,5\u2019\u2019  = 1.6 Hz, H -6\u2019\u2019a), 3.72 (s, 3H, OMe), 3.70 (dd, 1H, J6\u2019\u2019b,5\u2019\u2019  = 5.4 Hz, H -\n6\u2019\u2019b), 2.78 (t, 2H, J2\u2019,1\u2019 = 7.0 Hz, H -2\u2019), 2.72 (dd, 1H, J6a,6b = 14.1 Hz, H -6a), 2.45 (dd, 1H, H -6b), 1.67 \n(dd, 3H, J10,1 = 1.4 Hz, H -10) ppm.  \n \n \nFigure  1. Chemical structure of OL.  \n \n2.2. Cell culture  \n \nThe human synovial cell line SW982 was purchased from the American Tissue Culture \nCollection (Manassas, VA). SW982 were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s\u00ae modified Eagle\u2019s medium \n(DMEM) with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcL/mL streptomycin at 37\u00baC in humified air \nwith 5 % CO 2. The medium was changed every 48 hours (h), and cell passage was carried out every \n3-4 days. For in vitro experiments, cells were incubated with DMEM for 24 h and then stimulate d \nwith IL -1\u03b2 (Sigma Che mical Co\u00ae, St Louis, MO, USA) at 5 ng/mL at the indicated time. The cells \nwere lysed after treatment and used for further experiments.  \n \n2.3. Cell viability assay  \n \nCells were seeded in 96 -well plates (1x105 cells well-1) and they were incubated in presence or \nabsence of OL for 24 h. At the end of the exposure time, the effect on cell growth/viability was \nanalysed by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (Skehan et al. , 1990) . After incubation time, adherent  \ncells cultures were fixed in situ by adding 50 \u03bcL of 50% (w/v) cold of trichloroacetic acid \n(AppliChem Panreac\u00ae, Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated for 60  min at 4\u00baC. The supernatant was \ndiscarded and plates were washed four times with deionized water and dried. 50 \u03bcL of SRB \n(Sigma -Aldrich\u00ae, St Louis, MO, USA) solution (0.4% w/v) in 1 % acetic acid (Panreac\u00ae, Barcelona, \nSpain) was added to each well and inc ubated for 30 min in dark at room temperature. The \nsupernatant was discarder and plates were washed five times with 1 % acetic acid. Then, plates \nwere air dried and added 100 \u03bcL per well of 10 mmol l-1 Tris base pH 10.5 (Sigma -Aldrich\u00ae, St \nLouis, MO, USA) and the absorbance of each well was read on an enzyme -linked immunosorbent \nChapter II \n \n97 \n assay reader at 492 nm ( iMARK Microplate Reader, BioRad\u00ae, CA, USA). Finally, cell survival was \nmeasured as the percentage compared with that obtained in control cells (non -treated c ells).  \n \n2.4. Determination of MMPs and pro -inflammatory cytokines by ELISA cytokines by ELISA  \n \nSW982 was plated in 24 -well plates (105 cells per well) for 48 h before treatment. After washing \nwith phosphate buffer solution ( PBS) (pH 7.4), cells were incubated at 37\u00baC with or with -out OL \nand IL -1\u03b2 (5 ng /mL) for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere. \nCulture supernatants were collected and stored at -80\u00baC. The levels of MMP -1 and MMP -3 were \ndetermined in cu lture supernatant from the above experiments using commercially available \nELISA kits essentially according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Ray Bio\u00ae Human MMP -1 \nELISA kit and Quantikine\u00ae Human cytokine MMP -3 immunoassay kit, R& D System). The \ncytoki nes (TNF -\u03b1 and IL -6) concentrations in the medium were measured using an eBioscience \nELISA Ready -Set Go\u00ae kit. \n \n2.5. Immunoblotting detection  \n \nCells (1x106 cells/mL) were untreated and treated with OL and stimulated with IL -1\u03b2 (5 \nng/mL) for 18 h. After incubation, cells were rinsed, scraped off and collected in ice -cold PBS \ncontaining a cocktail of protease and phosphatise inhibitors and processed as described by \nAparicio -Soto et al.,  (Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2014)   in order to isolate proteins. Protein concentration \nwas measured for each sample using a protein assay reagent (BioRad\u00ae, CA, USA) according to the \nBradford\u2019s method and using \u03b3 -globuline as a standard  (Bradford, 1976) . Aliquots of supernatant \ncontaining equal amount of protein (25 \u03bcg) were separated on 10 % acrylamide gel by sodium \ndodecyl sulphate -polyacriamide  (SDS)  gel electrophoresis. In the next step, the proteins were \nelectrophoretically transferred into a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with specific primary \nantibodies:  rabbit anti -COX 2 and rabbit anti -mPEGs1  (Cayman\u00ae, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) (1:1000 and \n1:200, respectively), rabbit anti -I\u03baB-\u03b1, rabbit anti -HO1, rabbit anti -Nrf2, rabbit anti -pERK and \nmouse anti -ERK, mouse anti -pJNK, rabbit anti -JNK, mouse anti -pp38 and rabbi t anti -p38 (Cell \nSignaling\u00ae, Danvers, MA, USA) (1:1000) overnight at 4\u00baC. After rinsing, the membranes were \nincubated with a horseradish peroxidise -labelled (HRP) secondary antibody anti -rabbit (Cayman \nChemical\u00ae, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) (1:1000) or anti -mouse (Dako\u00ae, Atlanta, GA, USA) (1:1000) \ncontaining blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. To prove equal loading, the blots were \nanalysed for \u03b2 -actin expression using an anti -\u03b2-actin antibody (Sigma Aldrich\u00ae, MO, USA). \nImmunodetection was performed usin g enhanced chemiluminescence light -detecting kit \n(ThermoFisher Scientific\u00ae, Waltham, MA, USA). The immunosignals were captured using \nAmersham Imaging 600 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Barcelona, Spain) and densitometry data Chapter I I \n 98 \n were studied following normaliza tion to the house -keeping loading control. The signals were \nanalysed and quantified by an Image Processing and Analysis in Java (Image J, Softonic\u00ae) and \nexpressed in relation to the IL -1\u03b2 stimulated cells.  \n \n2.6. Statistical evaluation  \nAll values in the figures and text are expressed as arithmetic means \u00b1 standard error \n(S.E.M.). Experiments were carried out in triplicated. Data were evaluated with Graph Pad Prism\u00ae \nVersion 5.01 software (San Diego, CA, USA). The statistical significance of any difference in each \nparameter among the groups was evaluated by one -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed \nby Newman -Keuls\u2019 test.  P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. In the \nexperiments involving densitometry, the figures shown are representative of  at least four different \nexperiments performed on different days.  \n \n3. RESULTS  \n \n3.1. Effects of OL on cell viability  \n \nIn order to evaluate the effects of OL, on the viability of human synovial fibroblasts we \nperformed the SRB assay. The SRB assay is an efficient method for the toxicity screening of \ncompounds to adherent cells, based on the measurement of cellular protein content.  After 24 h, our \ndata demonst rated that viability of SW982 treated with OL was not significantly  reduced at \nconcentrations of 6. 25 to 100 \u03bcM showing a cell viability >90% (Figure 2).  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 .  Effect  of OL on cell viability.  The concentrations used in this study did not affect viability \nof SW982 cells. Cells were treated with OL (1.6 -200 \u03bcM) for 24 h. Cell survival was measured as the percentage \nof absorbance compared with that obtained in control cells (non -treated cells).  \n \n \nChapter II \n \n99 \n 3.2. Effects of OL on pro-inflammatory  cytokines production  \n \nTreatment of SW982 cells with IL -1\u03b2 increased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines \n(IL-6 and TNF -\u03b1) levels  when compared with cells without stimulus (Figure 3). On the contrary, \nPRE -TREATMENT  with OL resulted in a significant inhibition of IL -6 and TNF\u03b1 production \ninduced by IL -1\u03b2.  \n \n \n \nFigure 3 .  Inhibitory effects of OL on the production of IL -6 and TNF -\u03b1 by SW982 cells. SW982 cells \nwere cultured for 24 h in presence or absence of OL and sti mulated with IL -1\u03b2 (5 ng/mL). As control, cells were \nuntreated in absence of IL -1\u03b2. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SE M (n=6). *** p<0.001; significantly different from \nControl cells (no stimulated); +p<0.05 and +++p<0.001; significantly different from IL-1\u03b2-stimulated control cells  \n \n \n3.3. Effects of OL on MMPs production  \n \nAs shown in figure 4, SW982 cells exhibited an inflammatory response following IL -1\u03b2 \nstimulation, which is evidenced by the elevated secretion of MPP -1 and MMP -3 in these cells. By \ncontrast, PRE -TREATMENT  with OL at concentrations of 50 and 100 \u03bcM  for 24 h, significantly \nreduced both MMP -1 and MMP -3 up -regulation in IL -1\u03b2-treated SW982 cells.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter I I \n 100 \n  \nFigure 4.

As control, cells \nwere untreated in absence of IL -1\u03b2. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SE M (n=6). ***p<0.001; significantly different \nfrom Control cells (no stimulated); ++p<0.01 and +++p<0.001; significantly different from IL-1\u03b2-stimulated control \ncells.  \n \n \n3.4. Effects of OL on mPEGs -1 and COX -2 overexpression  \n \nIt is well known that both, COX -2 and mPGES -1, are up -regulated and responsible for the \noverproduction of PGE 2 which may affect joint integrity through EP 4 receptor activation  (McCoy, \nWicks and Audoly, 2002; Xiao et al. , 2016) . Thus, we investigated the possible effects of OL on \nmPEGs -1 and COX -2 inflammation -related enzymes expression. COX -2 and mPEGs -1 protein \nexpression was remarkably increased after 24h -IL-1\u03b2 stimulation  whereas a significant down -\nregulation on both COX -2 (Figure 5A) and mPEGs -1 expression was seen in SW982 cells treated \nwith OL at 50 and 100 \u03bcM (Figure 5B).  \n \n \n \nChapter II \n \n101 \n Figure 5. OL inhibit COX -2 (A) and mPEGs -1 (B) protein expression in IL -1\u03b2-stimulated SW982 \ncells. Cells were untreated or treated with OL (50 and 100 \u03bcM) for 24 h in presence of IL -1\u03b2 (5 ng/mL). Control \ncells were incubated in absence of IL -1\u03b2. The plots represent band intensity. \u0392-actin served as an equal loading \ncontrol for n ormalization. Data shown are means \u00b1 SEM (n=5).  *** p<0.001; significantly different from Control \ncells (no stimulated); ++p<0.01 and +++p<0.001; significantly different from IL -1\u03b2-stimulated control cells.  \n \n3.5. OL prevented IL -1\u03b2-induced MAPKs activation on S W982 cells  \n \nMAPK signaling  pathway has been shown to be involved in  the expression of \ninflammatory mediators  (Rosillo et al. , 2015) . To determine whether the effects of OL were \nattributable to the inhibition of MAPK activation,  we evaluated whether both concentrations (50 \nand 100 \u03bcM) were able to modulate JNK, p38 and extracellular signal -regulated kinases (ERK ) \nactivation after 30 min of IL-1\u03b2 (5 ng/mL) stimulation by W estern blotting. As shown in Fig. 6,  \ntreatment with IL -1\u03b2 significantly enhanced phosphorylation of p38, JNK  and ERK MAPKs  in \ncomparison to unstimulated cells.  On the contrary pre-treatment  with OL (50 and 100 \u03bcM) \nsignificantly blocked IL -1\u03b2-induced phosphorylation (Figure 6) .  \n \n \n \nChapter I I \n 102 \n Figure 6. Effects of OL on MAPK signaling  pathway in IL -1\u03b2-stimulated SW982 cells.   Cells were \nuntreated or treated with OL (50 and 100 \u03bcM) for 24 h in presence of IL -1\u03b2 (5 ng/mL) for 30 min. Control cells \nwere incubated in absence of IL -1\u03b2. Densitometry was performed following normalization to the control \nhousekeeping genes (JNK,  p38 and ERK (1/2). Data shown are means \u00b1 SEM (n=5).  *** p<0.001; significantly \ndifferent from Control cells (no stimulated); + p<0.05 ;++ p<0.01 and +++ p<0.001; significantly different from IL -\n1\u03b2-stimulated control cells.  \n \n3.6. Effects OL on IL -1\u03b2 induced I\u03baB -\u03b1 degradation on SW982 cells  \n \nNF-\u03baB is a pleitropic mediator in the control of several inducible and tissue -specific genes \nand is one of the key regulators of the cellular responses to oxidative stress in mammalian cells   \n(Helenius et al. , 2001) . NF-\u03baB activation is ini tiated by the degradation of I\u03baB -\u03b1. After I\u03baB -\u03b1 is \ndegraded, NF -\u03baB in the NF -\u03baB-I\u03baB-\u03b1 complex, in free to be translocated into the nucleus, where it \ncan induce the expression of pro -inflammatory genes contributing to the damage. To determine \nwhether pro -inflammatory proteins down -regulation is regulated by the I\u03baB -\u03b1 pathway, we \nmeasured the expression levels of I\u03baB -\u03b1 in SW982 cells pre -treated with OL for 24 h. As shown in \nFigure 7, I\u03baB -\u03b1 was significantly reduced in SW982 cells stimulated with IL -1\u03b2 wherea s PRE -\nTREATMENT  with OL at concentration 50 and 100 \u03bcM significantly prevented IKB -\u03b1 degradation \nin IL -1\u03b2 stimulated SW982 cells (Figure 7).  \n \nFigure 7.

Effects OL on H O-1 and Nrf2 protein expression  \n \nThe expression of the proteins HO -1 and Nrf2 was also evaluated in SW982 cells pre -\ntreated with OL for 24 h. Our data show that HO -1 was significantly down regulated in SW982 cells \nstimulated with IL -1\u03b2 in comparison to unstimulated cells . However, pre-treatment  with OL at \nconcentration 50 and 100 \u03bcM significantly up -regulated HO -1 protein expression. Nrf2 activation \nhas been reported to play an important role in HO -1 expression. According to our results, Nrf2 \nexpression was reduced in IL -1\u03b2-stimulat ed cells, however a significant increase in Nrf2 protein \nlevels was observed in SW982 pre -treated cells with OL at concentration 50 and 100 \u03bcM (Figure 8).  \n \n \n \nFigure 8.

Densitometry was performed following \nnormalization to the control ( \u03b2-actin housekee ping gene). Data shown are means \u00b1 SE (n=5).  ** p<0.01 and \n***p<0.001; significantly different from Control cells (no stimulated); +p<0.05, ++p<0.01and +++p<0.001; \nsignificantly different from IL -1\u03b2-stimulated control cells.  \n \n \n4. DISCUSSION  \n \nRA pathology is characterized by chronic synovitis in poly -articular joints.  In RA joints,   \nthere are hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the synovial lining cells, specifically, SFs. In fact, SFs act \nas a major cell population in the invasive pannus to parti cipate in the chronic inflammatory \nChapter I I \n 104 \n responses  (Firestein, 1996) . Importantly, our findings have s hown, for the first time, that OL, the \nmost prevalent phenolic component in olive leaves, seed, pulp and peel of unripe olives was able to \ninhibit the activation of SW982 human synovial cells induced by IL -1\u03b2, preventing the \ninflammatory response.   \nSFs contribute significantly to matrix degradation in RA through the production of \ninflammatory mediators such as  cytokines  mainly TNF -\u03b1 and IL -6 sustaining regulatory feedback \nloops that induce the production of , enzymes, such as MMPs  through the activation of cellular \nsignaling  pathways involving MAPKs  (McInnes and Schett, 2007; Su et al. , 2016) . \nTNF -\u03b1 is reportedly involved in early joint swelling, chronic joint inflammation, and the \nconcomitant erosive changes in cartilage and bone  (Sommerfelt et al. , 2013) . On the other hand, IL -6 \nis a key cytokine inducing a decrease in type II collagen (CII) production, increase in MMPs \nsynthesis, and changes in the su bchondral bone layer  (Chenoufi et al. , 2001) . Previous findings \nproved that IL -6 is responsible for the increase of serum \u03b3 -globulin and the emergence of \nrheumatoid f actors  (Visser, Smith and Louw, 2010) . Besides, high levels of IL -6 have been detected \nin both sera and synovial fluids from the affected joints  of RA patients. In this study, we have \ndemonstrated that treatment with OL caused a significant inhibition of IL -1\u03b2-induced TNF -\u03b1 and \nIL-6 release in human synovial SW982 cells.  These suggest that OL may have the potential to \nregulate pro - inflammatory c ytokines in synoviocytes.   \nAmong MMPs, MMP -1 (colagenase 1) and MMP -3 (stromelysin)  have been reported to be \nthe major enzymes produced by fibroblasts and macrophage -like cells in the synovium, and their \nlevels are significantly higher in synovial fluids from patients with RA  (Rosillo et al. , 2016) . MMP -1 \nis one of the critical neutral proteinases which degrade native fibrillar collagens in the extracellular \nmatrix  (Yamanishi and Firestein, 2001) . On the other hand, MMP -3 is respo nsible to degrade \nproteoglycan, type IV and type IX collagens and denatured type I and type II collagens, fibronectin, \ngelatin and laminin  and is believed to be especially important because, besides of its direct enzyme \nactivity, its activation is necessar y for full activation of collagenases  (Chen and Mattey, 2012) . Our \ndata showed that the production of both MMP -1 and MMP -3 was significantly induced by IL -1\u03b2 \nstimulation in human SW982 cells, whereas pre-treatment  with OL induced a significant down -\nregulation of both MMPs levels in IL -1\u03b2-stimulated SW982 cells.  \nCOX -2, the inducible isofor m of COX  and mPGES -1, enzymes responsible for the \noverproduction of PGE 2 in inflammation, are up -regulated contributing  to the progressi on of RA \nthrough EP 4 receptor activation  (McCoy, Wicks and Audoly, 2002) . We have shown that OL \ndecreased expression  of both COX -2 and mPGES -1 in IL -1\u03b2-stimulated SW982 cells .  Our data are \nin agreement with those fr om Impellizzeri et al.,  (Impellizzeri et al. , 2011) , who show that OL-\naglycone decreased  mPEGs -1 and COX -2 expression by immunohistochemical staining and also \nreduced  the levels of the metabolite of COX -2, PGE 2, in the serum of OL-aglycone in mice subjected Chapter II \n \n105 \n to collagen -induced arthritis . Therefore, regulation of these pro -inflammatory biomarkers by OL \ncould represent a potential molecular target susceptible to OL modu lation, which has not been \ndemonstrated previously.  \nIncreasing evidence demonstrated that the activation of multiple stress signaling  \npathways (e.g., MAPKs and NF -\u03baB), which act as pivotal regulators of proliferation, differentiation, \nand cellular survival  in RA, significantly contributes to the pathogenic mechanisms of joint \ndestruction and inflammation in RA  (Liu et al. , 2016) . \nIn fact, NF -\u03baB has been implicated in cytokine release, activation, autoantibody \nproduction, cellular proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and numerous other processes associated \nwith RA. Also plays a pivotal role in the development and activation of Th -1 responses and is \nresponsible in addition to MAPKs for COX -2 up -regulation  (Makarov, 2001) . NF-\u03baB, as a dimeric \ntranscription factor exists in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex with the in hibitory protein IkB -\u03b1. \nAn inflammatory signal such as IL -1\u03b2 induced the activation of I\u03baB -\u03b1 kinase complex to \nphosphorylate members of the IkB family. Phosphorylated IkB becomes ubiquitinated and is then \ntargeted for degradation by the proteasome. The NF -\u03baB dimmers can then translocate to the \nnucleus and activate the transcription and repression of genes  (Hayden and Ghosh, 2008; \nSchei nman, 2013) .  \nMAP K family members, including ERK 1/2, JNK  and p38 MAPKs orchestrate the \nrecruitment of gene transcription, protein biosynthesis, cell cycle control, apoptosis and \ndifferentiation and allow cells to respond to oxidative stress and inflamma tion stimuli  (Munoz and \nAmmit, 2010) . MAPKs have previously been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of the \nsynthesis of chemokines, cytokines, adhesion molecules and PGs involved in RA and are \nconsidered as the major tyrosine phosphoryl ation proteins in human synovial stimulated with IL -\n1\u03b2 (Barchowsky, Frleta and Vincenti, 2000 ). Besides JNK MAPK modulates MMPs production by \nsynovial fibroblasts and drives osteoclast differentiation in RA  (Han et al. , 2001) . In particular, p38 \nMAPK regulates MMP -3 induction in fibroblasts and osteoclas t differentiation  (Rosillo et al. , 2015) . \nAccumulating studies have demonstrated that inhibitors of MAPKs and NF -\u03baB alleviated synovial \ninflammation, bone destruction, and cartilage damage in animal models of arthritis, including \nadjuvant arthritis in rats and CIA in mice  (Han et al. , 2001; Nishikawa et al., 2003) . \nAs expected, the exposure of IL -1\u03b2 significantly increased the degradation of I \u03baB\u03b1 and \nphosphorylation of ERK 1/2 , JNK and p38, indicating NF -\u03baB and MAPKs activation in SW982 cells \nwhich was consistent with previous studies reported by Schett  et al., and Inoue et al.,  (Schett et al. , \n2000; Inoue et al. , 2001) . However, pre-treatment  with OL, at concentration of 50 and 100  \u03bcM \nstrongly inhibited the I \u03baB\u03b1 degradation and prevented the activation of MAPKs.  These results \nindicate that OL inhibit inflammation in IL -1\u03b2-treated SW982 cells by regulating the NF -\u03baB and \nMAPKs pathways.   Chapter I I \n 106 \n Nrf2 is a redox -sensitive transcription factor and binds to antioxidant response elements \n(ARE) located in the promoter regions of many detoxifying/antioxidant genes, including HO -1. In \nbasal conditions, Nrf2 in sequestered in the cytoplasma by Kelch -likeE CH-associated protein 1 \n(Keap1) and degraded by the ubiquitin -dependent 26S proteasome system. In inflammatory and \nimmune conditions, the expression of this protein could be part of an adaptive mechanism to limit \ncytotoxicity via several mechanisms includi ng scavenging of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, \nregulation of cell proliferation and prevention of apoptosis  (Rosillo et al. , 2016) . Further more, the \ndeficiency of HO -1 in both mice and humans induces the characteristic phenotype of an increased \ninflammatory state, whereas the induction of HO -1 in animals leads to the protection of the \nprogression of arthritis with decreased levels of matrix M MPs and the prevention of cartilage \ndegradation suggesting the HO -1 plays the key role in RA therapeutic strategy  (Su et al. , 2016) .  \nOur data showed that OL treatment strongly augmented Nrf2 and HO -1 expression \nconferring a role of HO -1 in the beneficial effects of OL in IL -1\u03b2-stimulated SW982 cells.  Thus HO -\n1 could represent a potential molecular target susceptible to modulation with treatment with OL, \nwhich has not been demonstrated previously.  \nIn conclusion, our study has  demonstrated, for the first time, that OL prevented the \ninflammatory response and oxidat ive stress of IL -1\u03b2 -induced SW982 human synovial cells.  The \nmechanisms underlying these protective effects could be related   via down -regulation of MAPKs \nand NF -\u03baB and induction of Nrf2 -linked HO -1 signaling  pathways controlling the production of \npro-inflammatory cytokines, MMP -1 and MMP -3 levels as well as  mPGES -1 and COX -2 \noverexpression. Thus, OL might provide a basis for developing a new dietary strategy for the \nprevention and management of RA.  \n \n \nReferences  \n\uf0b7 Alirezaei, M. et al.

The present study  \nwas designed to evaluate the effects of both dietary OL and Per -OL supplementations on collagen -\ninduced arthritis (CIA) murine model.  \nThree -weeks -old DBA -1/J male mice were fed from weaning with 0.05% (w/w) OL, 0.05 % \nor 0.025% Per -OL. After six weeks of pre-treatment, arthritis was induced by bovine collagen type \nII by tail base injection  (day 0) and mice received a booster injection on day 21. Mice were sacrificed \n42 days after first immunization. Then, blood was recollected and paws were histological an d \nbiochemically processed.  \nOL and Per -OL diets significantly prevented histological damage and arthritic score \ndevelopment. In addition, serum collagen oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and \nmetalloprote inase 3 (MMP -3) as well as proinflammatory  cytokines levels in paw homogenates  \n(including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -\u03b1, interleukin (IL) -1\u03b2, IL -6, IL -17 and interferon (IFN) -\u03b3) \nwere significantly ameliorated in those animals fed with dietary secoiridoids. M itogen -activated \nprotein kinases (MAPK s) and nuclear transcription factor kappa -B (NF -\u03baB) activations were \ndrastically down -regulated whereas nuclear factor E2 -related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase -1 \n(HO -1) protein expressions were significantly up -regulated in those mice fed with OL and Pe r-OL \ndiets.  \nIn conclusion, in this study we have demonstrated that dietary OL and Per -OL treatments \nexert beneficial effects on arthritis CIA in mice improving the oxidative events via Nrf2/HO -1 \nactivation and returning  proinflammatory  markers to basal le vels through  blockage of MAPKs  and \nNF-\u03baB signaling pathways reactivation . OL and Per -OL supplements might provide a basis for \ndeveloping a new dietary strategy for the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis.  \nChapter III  \n115 \n  \nKeywords:  CIA, Nrf2, OL, Peracetylated -oleuropein, Rheumatoid arthritis.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1. INTRODUCTION  \n \nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most prevalent chronic, painful and debilitating autoimmune \ndisease in the world. It characterized by chronic synovitis leading to the progressive destruction of \njoints accompanied by systemic inflammation and the productio n of autoantibodies. In addition, \nRA includes extraarticular manifestations,  such as rheumatoid protuberances, pulmonary \ninvolvement or vasculitis and systemic comorbidities (Smolen , Aletaha and McInnes, 2016)  \naffecting to the patient\u2019s capacity to perform physical activities  compared with the healthy \npopulation (Malm et al. , 2017) .  \nAlthough the pathogenesis of RA is multifactorial,  substantial insights into RA \npathophysiology suggest that various  inflammatory pathways lead to an altered immune system \nand contribute to the joint damage during the disease. Particularly, immune cells mainly B -cells, T -\nChapter III  \n116 \n cells and macrophages and even fibroblast -like synoviocytes play pivotal  roles in RA pathogenesis  \n(Moon et al., 2014) . Autoreactive B -cells produce rheumatoid factors (RFs) and/or anti -citrullinated \nprotein antibodies (ACPAs) and also mediate T -cell activation through expression of co -stimulatory \nmolecules. According to  the T cells, they activate macrophages and fibroblasts and transform them \ninto tissue -destructive cells producing a variety of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines that \nperpetuate joint inflammation and aggravate tissue destruction at the chronic dise ase stage (Yap et \nal., 2018) . Nevertheless, several environmental and other factors such as multiple genetic, \ngeography, socioeconomic status, diet/nutrients, alcohol, smoking, and host microbiome also \ncontribute to the risk of developing RA (Deane et al. , 2017; Paolino et al. , 2019) .  \nUnderstanding the mechanisms involved in RA pathogenesis has led in large part to the \nclinical development of therapeutic drugs targeting specific cells and molecules. In fact, the most \nsuccessful therapeutic strategy in  this disease  include  disease -modifying -anti-rheumatic drugs  \n(DMARDs), such as methotrexate and cytokine -directed therapies including inhibitors  of tumor \nnecrosis factor (TNF) -\u03b1 and interleukin (IL) -6 (Burmester, Feist and D\u00f6rner, 2014; Law and Taylor, \n2019) . However , these drugs are effective in a fraction of patients only and have other limitations \nincluding high cost, the requirement of parenteral administration and important side effects. Thus, \nthe search of novel treatments with a more benign safety profile is ne eded. In this sense, within the \ntherapeutic approach of RA, nutritional therapy could be relevant because in the last few years, it \nhas been highlighted that determinate foods consumption has influence on health outcomes \n(Rosillo, Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra and S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo, 2016) . \nThe antioxidant and anti -inflammatory properties of biophenolic fraction from  olive leaves \nand fruits from Olea Europaea L., have been suggested as a potential application in several  in vitro \nand in vivo  models of inflammation studies (Rosillo, Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra and S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo, \n2016; Larussa, Imeneo and Luzza, 2019) . It is well -known that extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) \ncontains significant amoun ts of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) (oleic acid) and other minor \nbut highly bioactive components including triterpenic alcohols, sterols, hydrocarbons (squalene), \nvitamins (\u03b1 - and \u03b3 -tocopherols), \u03b2 -carotene, phytosterols and numerous functional phenoli c \ncompounds (C\u00e1rdeno, S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo and Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra, 2013) .  Similarly, olive leaves \nwhich represent a waste product from olive harvest an d pruning of olive trees, contain even higher \namount of bioactive polyphenols than olive oil. Thus, it could be an useful font of natural \ncompounds to study in different inflammatory conditions (Da Silva et al., 2019) . Particularly, \noleuropein (OL) the most abundant and characteristic polyphenolic compound in unprocessed \nolive leaves (Herrero et al., 2011)  is responsible for the major anti -inflammatory effects of  olive  leaf \nextract (Qabaha et al. , 2018) . It has been well -established that OL possess antioxidant and anti -\ninflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages (S. J. Ryu et \nal., 2015)  inhibiting biosynthesis of proinflammatory  cytokines, and regulating inflammatory Chapter III  \n117 \n response by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxigenase 2 (COX -2) suppression. \nBesides, it has been described that OL down -regulated TNF -\u03b1 secretion in freshly  isolated human \npolymorphonuclear cells (PBMCs) culture (Qabaha et al. , 2018)  and also the IL -1\u03b2-induced \ninflammation and oxidative stress in human synovial fibroblast cell line SW982 (Maria Luisa \nCastej\u00f3n et al. , 2017) .  \nOn the other hand, the synthesis of OL derivatives with better \npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles than OL could be a strategy in the management of the \ninflammatory process. In fact, there are some studies which have shown the advantages of \nacetylated  derivatives of natural compounds, since their lipophilic nature allows them to cross the \ncytoplasmic cell membranes and their uptake by cells, offering a possible protection of membrane \ncomponents using a LPS -induced acute inflammation model in murine iso lated macrophages \n(Maria Luisa Castejon et al., 2019) . More recently, it has been reported that both OL and its new \nperacetylated derivative, peracetylated -OL (Per -OL) attenuates kidney injury in pristane -induced \nsystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) model inhibiting proinflammatory  biomarkers overexpression \nvia activation of heme oxigenase - 1 (HO-1)/ Nuclear factor  E2-related factor 2 (Nrf 2) antioxidant \npathway and suppression of Janus kinase -signal transducer and activator of transcription \n(JAK/STAT), nuclear transcription factor -kappa B ( NF-\u03baB) and mitogen -activated protein kinases \n(MAPK s) activation  (M.L. Castejon et al., 2019) .  \nThese data suggest that a wide range of chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA could \nbenefit from these biologically active compounds. Thus, the present study was designed to \nevaluate, for the first time, the pot ential protective effects of both dietary OL and Per -OL treatments \nin a murine collagen -induced arthritis (CIA) model which reproduces the RA pathology and is very \nuseful for drug  screening in RA. In addition to macroscopic and histological analyses, we \ndetermined the effects of these experimental diets on the production of inflammatory mediators \nand explored the signaling pathways involved.  \n \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n \n2.1. Reagents  \n \nOL was extracted from olive leaves according to reported literature (Stamatopoulos, \nChatzilazarou and Kats oyannos, 2013) , following the purification by column chromatography \n(CH2Cl2 -MeOH 10:1\u21925:1) to give the product as a yellow solid. The synthesis of Per -OL was \ncarried out from OL. It was solved and stirred in a mixture of 1:1 (v/v) pyridine/acetic anhydr ide \nat 8\u00baC for 10 min. Then, the reaction was kept at room temperature overnight. After hydrolyzing \nthe acetic anhydride, the product was concentrated to dryness obtaining a residue that was purified \nby column chromatography (EtOAc -C. Hexane 1:1) to give t he product (quant.) as a brown solid. \nSpectroscopy data was identical to reported literature (Procopio AS   M.; Costa, N.; Nardi, M., 2008) .  Chapter III  \n118 \n  \n2.2. Animals  \n \nTo evaluate the be neficial effects of OL and Per -OL on CIA model, a total of 60 three -\nweeks -old male DBA -1/J mice (Janvier\u00ae, Le Genest St Isle, France) were maintained in our Animal \nLaboratory Center under standard conditions (temperature, 24 -25\u00baC; humidity, 70 -75%; lightin g \nregimen, 12L/12D). The animals were fed with the corresponded  experimental  pellets diets and \nwater ad libitum  during six weeks previous to the CIA induction and also along the all experimental \ntime. Particularly, m ice were randomized in five experimental groups (12 animals per group): (i) \nNa\u00efve group (SD -Na\u00efve); (ii) CIA Control group (SD -CIA), (iii) OL diet group enriched 0.05% (OL -\nCIA), (iv) Per -OL diet group enriched 0.05% (Per -OL 0.05 -CIA) and (v) Per -OL diet group  enriched \n0.025% (Per -OL 0.025 -CIA). Experiments followed a protocol approved by the Animal Ethics \nCommittee of the University of Seville, and all experiments were in accordance with the \nrecommendations of the European Union regarding animal experimentatio n (Directive European \nCounsel 2010/630/EU).  \n \n2.3. Induction of CIA  \n \nRA was induced in 10 -week -old male DBA -1/J mice. Bovine type II collagen (CII) 2 \nmg/mL in dilute acetic acid (MD Bioproducts\u00ae, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland) was emulsified in equal \nvolumes of Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant (2 mg/mL Mycobacterium tuberculosis , strain H37Ra; Difco\u00ae, \nDetroit, Michigan, USA). On day 0, DBA -1/J mice were immunized at the base of the tail with 100 \nmg of bovine CII . On day 21, mice received an intraperitoneal booster injection of 100 mg of CII \ndissolved in phosphate -buffered saline (PBS). Joint inflammation was scored visually in each paw, \nusing a scale of 0 -2 where 0 = uninflamed, 1 = mild, 1.5 = marked and 2 = sev ere. Scoring was \nperformed by two independent observers without knowledge of the experimental groups. Animals \nwere euthanized on day 42 by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of a mix of ketamine and diazepam \n(1:2).  \n \n2.4. Histological and immunohistochemical  analyses  \n \nAfter mice were sacrificed, knee joints were removed and fixed in 4% formaldehyde. After \ndecalcification in 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) specimens were processed for \nparaffin embedding. Tissue sec tions (7 \u00b5m) were stained with h ematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to \nperform histological analysis. For immunohistochemistry assay of COX -2, the procedure was \naccording to Rosillo et al., 2014 (Rosillo et al. , 2014a)  using Vectastain Kit\u00ae; Vector Lab., Burlingame, \nCA, USA. Negative controls sections were incubated in the same way but in the absence of primary \nantibody. Positive cells staining and total cells were observed by two independent observers.  Chapter III  \n119 \n  \n2.5. Study  of inflammatory markers  \nEnzyme -linked immunoassay (ELISA) kits were used to measure serum levels of cartilage \noligomeric matrix protein (COMP) (MD Biosciences\u00ae, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland) and matrix \nmetalloproteinase  3 (MMP -3) (R&D Systems\u00ae, Abingdon, UK). Final paws were amputed above the \nankle and homogenized in 1 mL of 10 mM 4 -(2-hydroxyethyl) -1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid \n(HEPES) buffer, pH 7.4. Supernatants were used for determination of IL -17 (Peprotech\u00ae, London, \nUK), TNF -\u03b1, IL1 -\u03b2 (B D OptEIA\u00ae, San Jose, CA), interferon (IFN) -\u03b3 and IL -6 (Diaclone\u00ae, Besacon \nCedex, France). The results were measured at 450 nm using an ELISA microplate reader (BioTek\u00ae, \nBad Friedrichshall, Germany). All measurements were carried out in duplicate.  \n \n2.6. Isolation  of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins and immunoblotting detection  \nFrozen final paws were homogenized in liquid N 2. Isolation of cytoplasmic and nuclear \nproteins was performed according to Rosillo et al., (Rosillo et al. , 2016) . Protein concentration of the \npaw\u2019s homogenate was measured following Bradford\u2019s method (Bradford, 1976) . Aliquots of \nsupernatant that contain equal amount of protein (50\u00b5g)  were used to determine iNOS, pp38, \npJNK, p ERK, NF -\u03baBp65, NF -\u03baBp50, i nhibitory of NF -\u03baB (I\u03baB -\u03b1), Nrf2 (Cell Signaling\u00ae, MA, USA), \nmPGES -1 (Cayman Chemical\u00ae, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and HO -1 (Enzo\u00ae, Madrid, Spain) proteins \nexpression according by Western Blot  (Maria Luisa Castejon et al. , 2019) . The immunosignals were \ncaptured using Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare\u00ae, Buckinghamshire, UK) and the signals \nwere analyzed and quantified by an Image Processing and Analysis in Java (Image J\u00ae, Softonic).  \n \n2.7. Statistical evaluation  \nAll values in the te xt and figures are expressed as arithmetic means \u00b1 standard error \n(S.E.M.). Data were evaluated with Graph Pad Prism \u00ae Version 6.01 software (San Diego, CA, USA). \nThe statistical significance of any difference in each parameter among the groups was evaluate d by \none-way analysis of variance using Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test as post hoc test. P values of \n< 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In the experiments involving densitometry, the \nfigures shown are representative of at least three diff erent experiments performed on different \ndays.  \n \n3. RESULTS  \n \n3.1. Dietary OL and Per -OL treatments alleviated  CIA -related symptoms and RA -induced \ninfiltration of inflammatory cells  \n Chapter III  \n120 \n The development of RA was monitored until day 42. The time course of arthritic score \n(Fig. 1A) shows that CIA control mice fed with normal standard diet (SD -CIA) presented a \nprogressive development of clinical symptoms. On the contrary, the severity of RA symptoms in \nthose groups w hich were fed with OL 0.05 % and Per -OL 0.05 and 0.025 % experimental diets was \nlower than CIA control group from days 30 to 42. These results suggested that dietary OL and Per -\nOL could have a therapeutic effect on going inflammatory arthritis. Fig. 1B sho ws representative \nphotographs of hind paws from the different experimental diets animals groups.  \nIn addition, H&E staining revealed that histological features of the joint from sham \nanimals were typical of normal structure with synovial membrane composed o f synovial cells, \ncolla gen and a clear synovial space. On the contrary, joint s from SD -CIA mice exhibited histological \nchanges indicative of severe arthritis, characterized by an extensive inflammatory cells infiltration \ninto articular tissues, exudation i nto the synovial space, hyperplasia and cartilage erosion. These \nhistological features were less evident in those arthritic mice fed with OL and Per -OL experimental \ndiets (Fig. 1C).   \n \n \n \n \nChapter III  \n121 \n  \n \n \nFigure 1.

Effects of dietary OL an d Per -OL treatments  on serum proinflammatory  biomarkers levels  in \nCIA model  \n \nMMP -3 is well -known as a predictor for joint destruction in RA. We described an \nincrement of circulating MMP -3 levels in SD -CIA control group mice in comparison to SD -Na\u00efve \ncontro l group (** p<0.01 vs. SD-Na\u00efve control group) whereas these  levels were significantly \nreduced after OL and Per -OL dietary treatments at all doses assayed (#p<0.05; ##p<0.01 vs. SD -CIA \ncontrol group) (Fig. 2A). Similarly , serum levels of the cartilage degradation marker, COMP, were \nsignificantly increased in SD -CIA mice when compared to SD -Na\u00efve control group (*** p<0.001 vs. \nSD-Na\u00efve control group). However, OL and Per -OL enriched diets significantly decreased serum \nCOMP levels in CIA mice reaching simi lar levels to those observed in SD -Na\u00efve control group \n(###p<0.001 vs. SD -CIA control group) (Fig. 2B).  \n \n \nChapter III  \n122 \n  \n \n \nFigure 2.

Dietary OL and Per -OL treatments suppressed the production of proinflammatory  cytokines in \nCIA model  \n \nWe studied if dietary OL and Per -OL treatments were capable to reduce the \nproinflammatory  cytokines levels, which were involved in the pathogenesis of RA. We exam ined \nthese proinflammatory  cytokines levels in paws homogenates by ELISA. We could observe a higher \nincrease on IL -1\u03b2, IL -6, IL -17, IFN -\u03b3 and TNF -\u03b1 levels in paw homogenates from SD -CIA control \ngroup (** p<0.01; *** p<0.001 vs. SD -Na\u00efve) when compared with S D-Na\u00efve mice. Nevertheless, these \nlevels were reduced significantly on those mice were fed with0.05%) OL and 0.05% or 0.025% Per -\nOL experimental diets (#p<0.05 and ##p<0.01 vs. SD -CIA control group) (Fig. 3).  \n \nChapter III  \n123 \n  \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

OL and Per-OL experimental diets reduce d COX -2 and iNOS over expression s \n \n \nThe effects of OL and Per -OL dietary treatments on CIA-induces COX -2 activation  were \ndetermined by immunohistochemistry on knee joint sections. We could observe a significant \noverexpression of COX -2 positive cells in SD -CIA control group, whereas OL and Per -OL \nexperimental diets reduced notably the immunoreactivity for this proinflam matory enzyme (Fig. \n4A). In  addition, the protein expression of iNOS was significantly upregulated in paw s \nhomogenates from in SD -CIA mice in comparison to SD -Na\u00efve control group (* p<0.05 vs. SD -Na\u00efve \ncontrol group) whereas, the protein expression of this proinflammatory  enzyme was down -\nregulated in paws from arthritic mice fed with 0.05 % and 0.025 % Per -OL experimental diets \n(#p<0.05; ##p<0.01 vs. SD -CIA control group) (Fig. 4B).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter III  \n124 \n  \n \nFigure 4 .

Effects of dietary OL and  Per-OL treatments on MAPKs, NF\u03ba \u03b2 and Nrf2/HO signaling pathways  \n \nWe investigated the effects of OL and Per -OL experimental diets on NF -\u03baB, MAPK s and \nNrf2/HO -1 signa ling pathways in paw homogenates.  \nAs shown in Fig. 5, the  expression of cytoplasmatic I\u03baB -\u03b1 was significantly reduced in SD -\nCIA control group when compared with SD -Na\u00efve control group (*** p<0.001 vs. SD -Na\u00efve contr ol \ngroup) which was accompanied by an overexpression of nuclear NF -\u03baBp65 and NF -\u03baBp50 subunits \nprotein expression s in SD -CIA control group ( **p<0.01; ***p<0.001 vs. SD -Na\u00efve  control group). On \nthe contrary, dietary OL and Pe r-OL treatments prevented the  I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation (#p<0.05; ##p<0.01 \nvs. SD -CIA control group) and prevented the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 subunits \n(#p<0.05; ###p<0.001 vs. SD -CIA control group).  \n \nChapter III  \n125 \n  \n \nFigure 5 . Protein expression of nuclear NF -\u03baB-p65 and \u2013p50 subunits and cytoplasmatic I\u03baB -\u03b1 fraction \nwas determinate in hind paws.

We observed  a significant increase on ERK 1/2, JNK and p38 \nphosphorylation in SD -CIA control group in comparison with SD -Na\u00efve control group (*** p<0.001 \nvs. SD -Na\u00efve control group). Nevertheless, the phosphorylation degree of these MAPKs proteins \nwas significantly ameliorated in those arthritic mice fed with all experimental diets assayed \n(#p<0.05; ##p<0.01; ###p <0.001 vs. SD -CIA control group) (Fig. 6).  \n \nChapter III  \n126 \n  \n \n \nFigure 6 .

We could observe  a remarkable downregulation of both Nrf2 and \nHO-1 protein expressions in SD -CIA mice ( *p<0.05; **p<0.01 vs. SD -Na\u00efve control group) whereas \nOL (0.05%) and Per -OL (0.05%) experimental diets induced a significant Nrf2 an d HO -1 \noverexpression in comparison with SD -CIA control group (#p<0.05; ##p<0.01 vs. SD -CIA control \ngroup) (Fig. 7).  \n \nChapter III  \n127 \n  \n \nFigure 7 .

DISCUSSION  \n \nIn this study,  dietary OL and Per-OL treatments effectively reduced the clinical arthritis \nseverity and the histologic score in  mice with CIA , a model of RA which is commonly used to study \nand i nvestigate mechanisms involved  in RA development as well as a new strategy of RA therapy \n(Ferrandiz et al., 2007) . In addition, OL and Per -OL treatments markedly inhibited oxidative \ndamage and reduced proinflammatory cytokine expression in i nflamed joints.  The main \nmechanisms by which OL and Per-OL exert ed their antiarthritic efficacy was mediated by a \ndramatically increase on antioxidant  Nrf2/HO -1 signaling and an inhibition of  NF-\u03baB and MAPK s \nsignal pathways.  \nArthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder affecting synovial lining of joints, \nbursae and tendon sheaths  (Guo et al. , 2018) . The objective of conventional pharmacological \ntherapy of RA is to finish or reverse cartilage destruction and diminish the pain devoid of \nuntoward effects. However, current trea tments are not efficient in all patients and possess a \nnumber of disadvantages, such as high cost, necessity for parenteral administration and potential \nadverse effects. Consequently, nutritional therapy as complementary and alternative medicine is \nunder d evelopment as an innovative strategy in RA management (Gaforio et al. , 2019) . In fact, it has \nChapter III  \n128 \n been demonstrated that nutritive and non -nutritive dietary factors can affect the clinical outcome of \nrheumatic diseases.  In this line, dietary polyphenols have been extensively investigated with \nregard s to their antioxidant, anti -inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties in many \ninflammatory chronic conditions , including RA . Several studies have shown that among bioactive \npolyphenols , hydroxytyrosol  (HTy), h ydroxytyrosol  acetate (HTy -Ac), genistein, kaempferol and \nresveratrol seem  to be effective in C IA, an experimental model for RA that shares a number of \npathological, histological and immunological features with human RA , by decreasing the \nproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, and activating the antioxidant defense system  (Rosillo et \nal., 2014b, 2015; Oliviero et al. , 2018) .  \nCIA induction resulted in the development of a pronounced synovitis associated with an \nautoimmune response against cartilage  with inflammatory cells infiltrate  and production of many \ncytokines and matrix -degrading, accompanying cartilage degradation and bone erosions  \n(Schurgers, Billiau and Ma tthys, 2011; Bao et al. , 2017) . Our results revealed that OL and Per -OL \nsupplemented diets exhibited preventive effects in the development of inflammation and joint \ndamage in SD -CIA in comparison with animals that were fed with OL and Per -OL enriched -diets. \nThese results were correlated to an improved arthritis score and with a reduction of inflammatory \ncells infiltration into articular tissue, synovial hyperplasia and cartilage destruction.  These results \nare in accordance with data published by Impelliz zeri et al., who reported an amelioration of \narthritis development caused by injection of collagen type II in mice and in  by intraperitoneal \nadministration of OL -aglycone (Impellizzeri, Esposito, Mazzon, Paterniti, Di Paola, Bramanti, et al. , \n2011; Impellizzeri, Esposito, Mazzon, Paterniti, Di Paola, Morittu, et al. , 2011).  \nThe secretion of MMPs, cytokines and growth factors contribute to the loss of normal \nhomeostasis in the synovial joint leading inflammation and joint damage on RA. Cytokines \nregulate the phenotype of effector and regulatory T -cells in the synovium. Thus, a n imbalance of \ncytokine network contributes to the development and progression of this autoimmune disease. \nParticularly, TNF -\u03b1, IL -6,  IL -1\u03b2 and IFN -\u03b3 are considered as disease promoting cytokines in RA \n(Komatsu and Takayanagi, 2012; Pradhan et al. , 2019) . In synovium , patients with RA had high \nfrequenci es of Th1 cells and also of Th 17 cells, which are thought to play a prominent pathogenic \nrole in autoimmune arthritis. More recently, in plasma from RA patients, levels of IL-17, IL -23 and \nIFN-\u03b3 were significantly increased and correlated with a redox imbalance and oxidative damage \n(Pradhan  et al. , 2019) . Besides, COMP, a specific serological marker which evaluates the articular \ncartilage degradation and its turnover, exerts an active role in inflammation. Increased plasma \nlevels of COMP have been detected in the degenerating cartilage, s ynovial fluid and serum of \npatients with knee injuries and primary osteoarthritis (OA) and RA (Lai et al., 2012 ; Haikal et al. , \n2019) . Among MMPs, MMP -3 (stromelysin ) has been reported to be the major enzymes produced \nby fibroblasts and macrophage cells in the synovium, and is responsible for the degradation of Chapter III  \n129 \n proteoglycan, various type of collagens and denatured type I and type II collagens, among others, \nbesides of  its direct enzyme activity its activation is necessary for full activation of collagenases (M \nL Castej\u00f3n et al. , 2017) . Our results revealed that those arthritic mice fed with OL and Per -OL \nenriched -diets showed a significant reduction in  serum MMP -3 and COMP levels as well as in IL -\n17, TNF -\u03b1, IL1 -\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 and IL -6 proinflammatory  cytokines  levels in paw tissues in compa rison \nwith SD -CIA control group which was correlated with the macroscopic and histological findings. \nThese results are also in agreement with Castej\u00f3n et at., who reported that OL controlled the \nproduction of inflammatory mediators decreasing IL -6 and TNF -\u03b1 cytokines, MMP -1 and MMP -3 \nlevels and mPGES -1 and COX -2 overexpression  in human syno vial fibroblast cell line SW982 \n(Maria Luisa Castej\u00f3n et al. , 2017) .  \nThe overexpression and activation of proinflammatory  enzymes, including iNOS and \nCOX -2, are known to intensify the disease severity of RA (Altomonte et al. , 1992) , which promoting \ninflammation and oxidative damage of the arthritic joint (Hemshekhar et al. , 2017) .  In fact, COX -2 \nand iNOS protein expr essions are increased on rats CIA model and consequently, contributing to \nthe progression of RA (Jing et al. , 2019) . In accorda nce with  Ryu et al., (S.-J. Ryu et al. , 2015)  who \nreported that OL suppressed the release of LPS -induced NO production and iNOS/ COX -2 \noverexpression in RAW 264.7 murine macr ophages  and in LPS -stimulated murine peritoneal \nmacrophages (Maria Luisa Castejon et al. , 2019) , we have demonstrated that dietary OL and Per -OL \ntreatments reduced COX -2 inmunohisto chemical expression in knee joi nts from DBA/1  mice CIA -\nmodel and this was accompanied by a significant decrea se on iNOS protei n expression in paw \nhomogenates reducing efficiently the joint damage. In addition, previous studies have shown that \nOL induced a downregulation of NF-\u03baB transcr iptional activity and dramatically suppression of \nthe MAPK s activation in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes  and in murine peritoneal macrophages \nstimulated with LPS  (Feng et al. , 2017; Maria Luisa Castejon et al. , 2019) .  \nSimilarly, t he main intracellular signal transduction pathways involved in RA include \nMAPKs, NF -\u03baB and JAK/STAT  pathway s. Understanding of the signal transduction pathways \nimplicated in RA has led to drug development programmers targeting MAPK s and NF -\u03baB \ninhibitors  (Smolen and Steiner, 2003 ; Malemud, 2018) . In addition, a wide range of evidence \nindicates that Nrf2 transcription factor, may control different mechanisms involved in the \nphysiopathology of rheumatic condition playing a central role in the protection of cells against \noxidative  stresses,  up-regulating several genes en coding anti -inflammatory and antioxidant \nproteins, such as HO -1 (Mohan and Gupta, 2018) .  HO-1 gene expression activation  is considered \nto be an adaptive cellular response to survive exposure to environmental stresses (Rosillo et al. , \n2016 ; Fan et al. , 2018) . Besides, some studies have revealed an interaction between members of the \nNrf2 and NF -\u03baB pathways, since that oxidative stress -induced NF-\u03baB activation plays a pivotal role \nin the proinflammatory overproduction factors associated with the pathogenesis of RA  and the Chapter III  \n130 \n activation of the Nrf2/  Antioxidant responsive elements  (ARE ) system disrupts this cyc le (Ahmed \net al. , 2017) . Particularly, Nrf2 inhibition aggravates cartilage destruction and accelerates the \neffector phase of RA in mice. NF-\u03baB is considered a key signal ing pathway in the control of \nsynovial inflammation, hyperplasia and matrix generation (Zou et al. , 2017)  and is able to modulate \nthe expression of several proinflammatory  genes  such as  IL-1\u03b2, TNF -\u03b1, IL -6 and IL -17 in  CIA \nexperimental model (Ros illo et al. , 2016) .  High levels of these proinflammatory  cytokines induce \nthe recruitment of co -stimula ry molecules which leading to the activation of NF -\u03baB and MAPKs \nsignaling pathways (Rosillo et al. , 2014a)  which is responsible for COX -2 up -regulation (Xie et al. , \n2013) . For this reason, intra -articular or systemic blockade of NF -\u03baB signal ing pathway is an \neffective target in the management  of RA (Min et al. , 2013) . Our data revealed that Nrf2 and HO -1 \nprotein expressions were decreased in SD -CIA control group; however, dietary OL and Per -OL \ntreatm ents could restore Nrf2 and HO -1 expressions conferring a rema rkable role of Nrf2/HO -1 \nsignal ing pathway in the beneficial effects of OL and Per -OL enriched -diets in CIA model of RA.  \nThese results are in agreement with Castej\u00f3n et al., showed that both die tary OL and Per-OL \ntreatments induced an activation of Nrf2/HO pathway and prevented the MAPK s activation and \nnuclear NF -\u03baB-p65 and NF -\u03baB-p50 translocations by blocking I\u03baB -\u03b1 degradation in a pristane -\ninduced SLE murine model. This was accompanied by a dec rease on many proinflamatory markers \nproduction involved in this inmunoinflammatory disease (M.L. Castejon et al., 2019) . According to \nour results, induction of HO -1 expression may protect against cartilage destruction and decrease \nthe secretion of proinflammatory  cytokines in CIA model (Li et al. , 2014) . Besides, upregulating the \nexpression of Nrf2 may exert anti -inflammatory effects in RA (Wu et al. , 2016) . In this sense, our \ndata suggest that Nrf2 overexpression observed in those arthritic animals fed with OL and Per-OL \ndietary treatments significantly could prevent the nuclear NF -\u0138B transcription factor, resul ting in \nan ameliorated proinflammatory  markers production reducing the  joint inflammatory injury.   \n \nAt the same time, MAPKs can participate in the regulation of NF -\u03baB transcriptional \nactivity . Furthermore, we determined that dietary OL and Per-OL treatment s influenced the \nactivation of MAPK s. It is well -established tha t MAPKs play important roles in transducing \nsynovial inflammation and joint destruction and they are considered critical molecular targets for \ntherapeutic intervention in RA (Thalhamer, McGrath and Harnett, 2007) . JNK and ERK 1/2 MAPKs \nare closely associated with collagenase production and inflammatory responses of fibroblast -like \nsynoviocytes,  whereas p38 MAPK isoforms is involved in regulating many of cellular biological \nprocesses, concretely synovial inflammatory cytokine produc tion, which participate to the RA \npathogenesis (Zou et al. , 2017) . ERK 1/2 also participates in promoting pannus formation and bone \ndestruction in arthritic joints (Goodridge et al., 2003) . In the present study, the phosphorylation of \nall thre e kinases (ERK 1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK s) was upregulated by inflammation  and was related Chapter III  \n131 \n with the results obtained in proinflammatory cytokines profile de terminations. On the contrary, OL \nand Per -OL experimental diets were able to prevent the phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK 1/2, \nsuggesting a role of MAPK s and NF-\u03baB in the mechanism throu gh which OL and Per -OL may have \nantiarthritic activity.  \nIn summary,  our study showed, for the first time, the beneficial effects of dietary OL and \nPer-OL supplementation in CIA model of RA by reducing arthritic damage, serum \nproinflammatory  biomarkers (MMP -3 and COMP), cytokines production (IL -6, IL -1\u03b2, TNF -\u03b1, IFN -\n\u03b3, IL -17), and inhibiting both iNOS and COX -2 overexpression. The possible action mechanisms \nimplicated in these  beneficial effects could be related to an activation of the antioxi dant Nrf2/HO -1 \npathway as well as a blockage of MAPKs and NF -\u03baB signaling pathways. Our results provide \nevidence for the anti -arthritic properties of both OL and Per -OL and corroborate their potential as a \nnew promising dietary strategy for the prevention and management of RA.   \n \n \nReferences  \n\uf0b7 Ahmed, S.

Recientes estudios indican que la inmunidad innata juega \nun papel fundamental en el desarrollo de LES. La oleurope\u00edna (OL) es uno de los compuestos \nfen\u00f3licos mayoritarios presentes en las aceitunas verdes y en las hojas del olivo, y adem\u00e1s posee \nnumerosas pro piedades beneficiosas.  \nEl objetivo principal de este estudio fue investigar el efecto de dietas enriquecidas con OL \ny OL peracetilada (Per -OL) en macr\u00f3fagos peritoneales extra\u00eddos de ratones con LES inducido por \npristano en ratones BALB/c y estimulados con lipopolisac\u00e1rido bacteriano (LPS).  \nLos ratones recibieron una inyecci\u00f3n de pristano v\u00eda intraperitoneal y fueron aliment ados \ncon las dietas experimentales enriquecidas con ambos compuestos. Veinticuatro semanas m\u00e1s \ntarde, los ri\u00f1ones de los ratones se recogen junto a los macr\u00f3fagos peritoneales para evaluar los \ndiferentes marcadores pro -inflamatorios y v\u00edas de se\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n intracelular que puedan estar \ninvolucradas en el proceso inflamatorio.  \nLos an\u00e1lisis macrosc\u00f3picos del tejido renal se llevaron  a cabo mediante la tinci\u00f3n con \nHematoxilina y Eosina, mientras que  la producci\u00f3n de citoquinas inflamatorias fue evaluado \nmedian te la t\u00e9cnica de ELISA y los cambios de expresi\u00f3n de las v\u00edas de se\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n celular fue \nevaluado mediante la t\u00e9cnica de Western B lotting. \nNuestros resultados demuestran que el tratamiento con dietas experimentales con OL and \nPer-OL reducen significativam ente los niveles de infiltrado inflamatorio en el tejido renal y adem\u00e1s \nde los niveles de las citoquinas pro -inflamatorias en los sobrenadantes de los macr\u00f3fagos obtenidos \nde los ratones con LES.

Recent research indicated that innate immunity plays vital roles in SLE.  Oleuropein \n(OL) is one of mainly biophenols in green olives and leaves, and possesses  many beneficial \nproperties.   \nThe aim of the study was investigated the effects of OL and its acetyl -derivate (Per -OL) \ndietary treatments on peritoneal macrophages from pristane -induced mice.  \nBALB/c mice received an injection of pristane or saline soluti on and were fed with \nexperimental diets with OL and Per -OL. After 24 weeks, we recollected kidneys and peritoneal \nmacrophages for experimental assays. In addition to macroscopic and histological analyses, pro -\ninflammatory cytokines production was evaluated  by enzyme -linked immunoassay (ELISA). The \nprotein expressions of pro -inflammatory markers and other signaling pathways activation were \ndeterm ined in macrophages by Western Bl otting. \nWe have demonstrated that OL and Per -OL dietary treatments reduced signif icantly these \nlevels in macrophages. Our data indicate that Janus kinase -signal transducer and activator of \ntranscription (JAK/STAT) , nuclear transcription factor -kappa B ( NF-\u03baB) and canonical and non -\ncanonical NLR family pyrin domain -containing 3 (NLRP3 ) inflammasome -complex signaling \npathways were drastically ameliorated.  \nThese results support the interest of OL and Per -OL dietary treatments as a beneficial \nalternative that exerts a preventing/palliative role in the management of SLE.  \n \n \n \nChapter IV  \n140 \n KEYWORDS:  Infla mmasome, lupus; macrophages; NLRP3; Oleuropein  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1. INTRODUCTION  \n \nSystemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disorder that courses \nwith a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors which break the threshold of \nimmune tolerance (Perry et al. , 2011) .   \nSLE damage has been characterized by disproportion of T -helper -cell (Th) subsets \n(Th1/Th2/Th17 ) and regulatory T -cells (Treg), autoantibodies and immune complexes. During the \nactive step of the disease, there is an increase of the inflammatory response with  higher serum and \n  Chapter IV  \n \n141 \n plasma levels of interferon (IFN) -\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -\u03b1, interleukin (IL) -4, IL -6, IL -10, IL -\n12, IL -17 and IL -18 and lower levels of IL -2 (Aparicio -Soto, S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo, Rosillo, et al. , 2016) . \nAlthough SLE pharmacological treatment has improved during the las t decade and many \npotential new agents are in development, there is evidence, that diet therapy could be a promising \napproach in SLE due to its potential prophylactic effects without the side effects of classical \npharmacology in addition to reduce comorbid ities and improve quality of life in SLE patients \n(Aparicio -Soto, S\u00e1nchez -Hidal go and Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra, 2017) . \nRecent studies have confirmed that extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption  can \ncontribute positive effects in rheumatic diseases.  The beneficial properties of EVOO are linked to its \nmultiple minor components, such as polyphenol compounds mainly flavonoids, lignans, \nsecoiridoids and their hydrolysis products hydroxytyrosol (HTy) and tyrosol (Ty) among others. In \nthis sense, previous studies from our research group have demonstrated that EVOO diet or olive \nbiophenols -enriched  diets improved  inflammatory processes in  experimental rheumatoid arthritis \n(RA) or  SLE in  mice  (Aparicio -Soto, S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo, C\u00e1rdeno, et al. , 2016) . Particularly, dietary \nHTy and hydroxytyrosol acetate (HTy -Ac) supplementation prevented pristane -induced SLE in \nmice reducing pro -inflammatory cytokines and ameliorated renal damage with a considerably \nblockage of different inflammatory -related pathways (Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2017) . In addition, \nphenolic fraction from EVOO treatment downregulated the gene expression of M1 macrophages \nmarkers and up regulated M2 molecules on M0 human macrophages.  The phenolic fraction from \nEVOO also reduced both cyt okine production and T cell activation, through blockage of nuclear \ntranscript ion factor -kappa B (NF -\u03baB) and mitogen -activated protein k inases (MAPK s)/ \nextracellular signal -regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways on peripheral blood mononuclear \ncells (PBMC) from patients with SLE in comparison with healthy donors (Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2018) . \nSimilar results we re described by Rosillo et al., where phenolic fraction from EVOO administration \nprevented inflammatory response and joint damage in murine experimental arthritis (Rosillo et al. , \n2014).  \nAmong secoiridoids, specifically, oleuropein (OL) is an ester of HTy containing an \noleosidic skeleton and a carbohydrate group which  has been shown to  possess antimicrobial, \nantiviral, anti -atherogenic, cardioprotective, anti -oxidative, anti -cancer and anti -inflammatory \nproperties  (Shamshoum, Vlavcheski and Tsiani, 2017; \u015eahin and Bilgin, 2018) . Our previous \nstudies have shown like OL was capable to prevent the inflammatory response and oxidative stress \non IL -1\u03b2-induced SW982 human synovial fibroblasts cells and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced \nmurine peritoneal macrophages (Castej\u00f3n et al. , 2017; Castejon et al. , 2019) .  \nSome studies have shown the importance of acetyl  derivatives of natural phenols since \ntheir lipophilic nature allows them to cross the cytoplasmic cell membranes and their uptake by \ncells, offering a poss ible protection of membrane components.  In this sense,  we confirmed  better Chapter IV  \n142 \n anti-inflammatory effects of  acetyl  OL derivat ives in comparison with OL in murine peritoneal \nmacrophages  which could be related to the modification of the chemical structure of  the original \ncompound (Castejon et al. , 2019) .   \nPristane -induced lupus model represents SLE from environmental activation with normal \ngenetic background   characterized  by an autoimmune syndrome closely resembling SLE with \nlupus -specific autoantibodies, nephritis, arthritis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and hematological \nmanifestations (Reeves et al. , 2009) . Pristane induces chronic inflammation  and  enhances  immune \nresponse s  involving  the continuous recruitment of leukocytes, including lymphocytes, \nneutrophils, dendritic cells  and macrophages, to the peritoneal cavity and the spleen (Leiss et al. , \n2013; Han et al. , 2017) . \nTaking into account, the present study was performed to i nvestigate the anti -\ninflammatory effects of OL and its new acetyl  derivative, peracetylated oleuropein (Per -OL) dietary \ntreatments on peritoneal macrophages from pristane treated mice with the objective of characterize \ninflammatory mediators , mechanisms an d signaling pathways involved.  \n \n \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n \n2.1. Reagents  \n \nOL was extracted according to reported literature (Stamatopoulos, Chatzilazarou and \nKatsoyannos, 2013 ), following the purification by column chromatography (CH 2Cl2-MeOH \n10:1\u21925:1) to give the product as a yellow solid.  \nThe synthesis of Per -OL was carried out from OL. It was solved and stirred in a mixture of 1:1 \n(v/v) pyridine/acetic anhydride at 8\u00baC for 10 min. Then, the reaction was kept at room \ntemperature overnight. After hydrolysing the acetic anhydride, the product  was concentrated to \ndryness obtaining a residue that was purified by column chromatography (EtOAc -C. Hexane 1:1) \nto give the product (quant.) as a brown solid. Spectroscopy data was identical to reported literature \n(Procopio AS   M.; Costa, N.; Nardi, M., 2008) . \n \n2.2. Animals and diets  \n \nTo evaluate the beneficial effects of OL and Per -OL on pristane model, a total of 60 twelve -\nweek -old BALB/c mice were used (Janvier Labs\u00ae, Sai nt-Berthevin Cedex, France). Mice were \nmaintained under constant conditions of temperature (20 -25 \u00baC) and humidity (40 -60%) with a \nlighting regimen of 12L/12D. They were fed with standard rodent chow (Panlab A04\u00ae, Seville, \nSpain) and water ad libitum until  SLE-like disease pristine induction.  \nMice were randomized in four experimental groups: (i) Sham group fed with standard \ndiet (SD) (n=10), (ii) pristane group fed with SD (n=20), (iii) pristane OL group fed with SD   Chapter IV  \n \n143 \n supplement with OL (100mg/kg diet) (n=15) and (iv) pristane Per -OL group fed with SD \nsupplement with Per -OL (100mg/kg diet) (n=15). Fresh diets were provided daily, and \nexperimental diets were formulated on the basis of the American Instituted of Nutrition  (AIN) \nstandard reference diet, and were prepared by mixing the pertinent compounds and stored at -\n80\u00baC.  \nMice were fed with the related diets along six months, and weight, water and food \nconsumption and mortality were monitored weekly. All animal care and  experimental procedures \nfollowed a protocol approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Seville, and all \nexperiments were in accordance with the recommendations of the European Union regarding \nanimal experimentation (Directive of the Euro pean Counsel 2010/630/EU).  \n \n \n2.3. Pristane induction of SLE -like disease  \n \nAt sixteen -weeks -old BALB/c mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mL pristane \n(99% pure, Sigma Aldrich Co\u00ae, St Louis, MO, USA) to induce SLE according to previous described \nprocedure by Satoh et al., 2009 (Reeves et al. , 2009) . After 24 weeks (experimental period), animals \nwere sacrificed and peritoneal macrophages, blood, thymus, lungs, spleen and kidneys were \ncollected.  \n \n2.4. Histological evaluation  \n \nKidneys were removed, fixed in neutral buffered 4% formaldehyde, and embedded in \nparaffin. Samples were sagittally sectioned at 5 \u00b5m and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E); \nfour samples per animal containing both cortex and m edulla were selected for evaluation. \nMorphological changes were evaluated at the light microscopic level by two different observers \nwho were unaware of the treatment group. Results are expressed as percentages of cases exhibiting \nhistological changes .  \n \n2.5. Isolation and culture of murine peritoneal macrophages  \n \nPeritoneal macrophages were collected following the procedure described by Aparicio -\nSoto et al., 2015 (Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2015) . Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in RPMI \n1640 medium (PAA\u00ae, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% heat -inactivated foetal calf serum \n(FCS) (PAA\u00ae, Pasching, Austria), L -glutamine (2 mM), glucose (4.5 g/l), and HEPES buffer (10 \nmM), in the presence of 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin (PAA\u00ae, Pasching, \nAustria) and seeded in culture plates for 2 h at 37\u00ba C in a 5% CO 2 humidi\ufb01ed atmosphere.  After  2 h, \ncells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS) and fresh RPMI 1640 medium without \nfetal bovine serum (FB S) containing different concentrations of assayed compounds (1 -4). After 30 Chapter IV  \n144 \n min, murine peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with 5 \u00b5g /ml of LPS from Escherichia Coli  \n(Sigma -Aldrich\u00ae, St Louis, MO, US) . In each experiment, viability was always \u2265 95% (data not \nshown). Cells supernatants were collected and stored at -80\u00baC for cytokine assays.  \n \n \n2.6. Enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  \n \nThe cytokine production in peritoneal macrophages cell -culture supernatants was \ndetected by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits among manufacture\u2019s procedure to \nmeasure the levels of TNF -\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 (BD OptEIA\u00ae, San Jose, CA); IL -6, IFN-\u03b3 (Diaclone\u00ae, Besa\u00e7on \nCedex, France) and IL -17 (Peprotech\u00ae, London, UK). The results were measured at 450 nm using an \nELISA microplate reader (BioTek\u00ae, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany). All measurements were carried \nout in duplicate.  \n \n2.7. Immunoblotting  \n \nCells (1\u00d7106 cells/ mL) were stimulated with LPS for 18 h. After incubation, cells were \nrinsed, scraped off and collected in ice -cold PBS containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase \ninhibitors and processed as described by S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo et al., 2005 (Sanchez -Hidalgo et al. , 2005) . \nProtein concentration was measured for each sample using a protein assay reagent (BioRad\u00ae, \nM\u00fanchen, Germany) according to Bradford\u2019s method (Bradford, 1976) . Aliquots of these \nsupernatants which contains equal amount of protein (15 \u03bcg) were separated on 10 -15% acrylamide \ngel by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrophoretically transferred \ninto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with specific primary antibodies: rabbit anti -COX -2 \nand rabbit anti -iNOS (Cayman\u00ae, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), mouse anti -pSTAT3 (Cell Signalling \nTechnology\u00ae, Danvers, MA, USA), mouse anti -NLRP3, mouse anti -ASC and rabbit anti -Caspase -1 \n(Cell Signalling Technology\u00ae, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti -Caspase -11 (Novus Biologicals\u00ae, \nLittleton, CO, USA), rabbit anti -IL-18 (AbCam\u00ae, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti -I\u03baB-\u03b1  (Cell Signalling \nTechnology\u00ae, Danvers, MA, USA). To prove equal loading, the blots were analysed for \u03b2 -actin \nexpression using an anti -b-actin antibody (Sigma \u2013Aldrich\u00ae, MO, USA). Immunodetection was \nperformed using enhanced chemiluminescence light -detecting kit (Pierce\u00ae, Rockford, IL, USA). The \nimmunosignals were captured using Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare\u00ae, Buckinghamshire, \nUK), and densitometric  data were studied following normalization to the housekeeping loading \ncontrol. The signals were analysed and quantified by an Image Processing and Analysis in Java \n(Image J\u00ae, Softonic) and expressed in relation to pristane control group.  \n \n2.8. Statistical ana lysis  \n \nAll values in the main text and figures are expressed as arithmetic means \u00b1 S.E.M. Data \nwere evaluated with Graph Pad Prism\u00ae Version 5.04 software (San Diego, CA, USA). The statistical \nsignificance of any difference in each parameter among the group s was evaluated by one -way   Chapter IV  \n \n145 \n analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey multiple comparisons test as post hoc test. P \nvalues of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant - In the experiments involving \ndensitometry, the figures shown are representat ive of at least four different experiments performed \non different days.  \n \n \n \n3. RESULTS  \n \n3.1. Effects of OL and Per -OL supplemented diets on pristine -induced model of SLE  \n \nSLE-pristane  induced model is characterized by a multiorgan autoimmune disease with a \nwide array of clinical manifestations and multifactorial pathogenic pathways. In this case, \ncomparison of different organ such as thymus, lungs and spleens weights between sham mice and \npristane group revealed a significant increment in thymus and spleens weights (* p<0.05 and \n***p<0.001 vs. SD -sham group) (Fig. 1). However, any significant difference were observed in which \nmice fed with OL and Per -OL diets in comparison with SD -SLE gr oup mice.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

OL and Per -OL enriched -diets ameliorated pro -inflammatory infiltration in kidneys from SLE -\npristane induced BALB/c mice  \n \nChapter IV  \n146 \n  As shown in Fig. 2, most mice of pristane -treated group presented some degree of renal \nabnormalities in comparison with control mice, ranging from abundant inflammatory mononuclear \ncells in the renal interstitium to renal interstitial fibrosis. In pristane -treated mice, most kidneys \n(90%) display ed inflammatory infiltrate, preferably located around the intact vascular wall close to \nglomeruli (Fig. 2B).  This inflammatory damage was considerably reduced after Per -OL diet (30%) \nand only lightly reduced after OL diet (70%) (Fig 2 A -D).  \n  \n \n \nFigure 2 .

Cell viability of peritoneal macrophages from SLE mice  \n \nCells (1x105 cells/well) were incubated in 96 well -plates for 18 h, and their viability was \nanalyzed by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (Skehan et al., 1990) . Cell survival was measured as the \npercentage of absorbance compared with that obtained in control cells (non -treated cells). In each \nexperiment, viability was always \u2265 95% (data not shown).  \n \n                     \n3.4. Effects of OL and Per -OL supplemented diets in LPS -induced cytokine production in peritoneal \nmacrophages from SLE mice  \nIn order to know whether OL and Per -OL supplemented diets could modulate cytokine \nproduction by primary LPS -stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages from SLE -mice , we \nmeasured Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines production in supernatants of peritoneal macrophages \nfrom SLE -pristane mice after 24 h of LPS stimulation. The levels of TNF -\u03b1, IL -1\u03b2, IL -6, IFN -\u03b3 and \nIL-17 were found increased in SLE mice stimulated with LPS in c omparison to sham mice \n  Chapter IV  \n \n147 \n (***p<0.001 vs. SD -sham group). However, these Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines levels significantly \ndecreased in LPS -stimulated macrophages from OL and Per -OL SLE mice (#p<0.05; ##p<0.01 and \n###p<0.001 vs. SD -SLE group) (Figure 3). Low levels of cytokines were detected in non -stimulated \nmacrophages (data not shown).  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3: OL and Per -OL decreased the levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines on LPS -stimulated \nmacrophages isolated from pristane -induced SLE mice.

Effects of OL and Per -OL supplemented di ets on over expression of ciclo oxygenase 2 (COX -2) \nand inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in peritoneal macrophages from SLE -mice  \n \nWe evaluated the effect of OL and Per -OL enriched diets on COX -2 and iNOS protein \nexpression. Whole cell lysates, from pe ritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPS from mice which \nwere received experimental diets. COX -2 and iNOS proteins upregulation were markedly induced \nby LPS treatment (** p<0.01, *** p<0.001 vs. SD -sham group) (Fig. 4). However, a significant \ndownregulation on these pro -inflammatory markers expressions were seen in SLE -OL and SLE -\nPer-OL macrophages (#p<0.05, ##p<0.01, ###p<0.001 vs. SD -SLE group).  \n \nChapter IV  \n148 \n                \n \n \nFigure 4: OL and Per -OL dietary induced the down -regulation of COX -2 and iNOS protein \nexpress ions in peritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPS from pristane -induced SLE mice .

OL and Per -OL supplemented diets modulate NF -\u03baB signaling pathway in murine peritoneal \nmacrophages of pristane -induced SLE  \n \nTo further explore the molecular mechanism underlying OL and Per -OL anti -\ninflammatory effects in murine peritoneal macrophages isolated from SLE -induced mice, we \nstudied the role of  NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. NF-\u03baB is normally complexed with inhibitor of NF -\u03baB \n(I\u03baB-\u03b1) in the cytoplasm (inactive state), but after c ellular stimulation, for example with LPS, I\u03baB -\u03b1 \nis phosphorylated, ubiquinated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome (S\u00e1nchez -Fidalgo et \nal., 2013) . For this reason, we measured the expression levels of I\u03baB -\u03b1 in cytosolic fractions of \nperitoneal macrophages from pristane -induced mice treated with 5 \u00b5g/mL LPS and incubated for \n  Chapter IV  \n \n149 \n 18 h. As shown in Fig. 5, treatment with OL and Per -OL significantly prevented I\u03baB -\u03b1 translocation \n(*p<0.05 vs. SD -sham group;  #p< 0.05 vs. SD -SLE group).  \n \n               \n \nFigure 5: OL and Per -OL dietary treatment prevented I\u03baB -\u03b1 degradation in macrophages isolated \nfrom pristane -induced SLE mice stimulated  with LPS.

Effects of OL and Per -OL supplemented diets in expression of signal transducer and acti vator of \ntranscription (STAT) -3 signaling pathways in peritoneal macrophages from SLE -mice  \n \nAs Fig. 6 shows a higher induced STAT3 phosphorylation in peritoneal macrophages was \nobtained from SLE -induced mice  in comparison with control group. However, OL and Per -OL \ntreatments could down -regulated the expression of p -STAT3 mice peritoneal macrophages \n(**p<0.01 vs SD -sham group, ##p<0.01 vs SD -SLE group).   \n \nChapter IV  \n150 \n                     \n \nFigure 6: OL and Per -OL treatmen t modulated STAT -3 signaling pathways in LPS -stimulated \nmurine peritoneal macrophages isolated from pristane -induced SLE mice.

(n=6). **p<0.01  vs. SD -sham group;  ##p<0.01  vs. SD -SLE group.   \n \n \n3.8. Effects of OL and Per -OL supplemented diets on inflammasome: canonical and non-canonical \nsignaling pathways in peritoneal macrophages from SLE -mice  \n \nNLRP family pyrin domain -containing 3 inflammasome (NLRP3) is considered to \noligomerize and recruit apoptosis -associated speck -like protein containing (ASC) and pro -caspase -\n1, thereb y triggering the maturation of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 (Zhang, Liu and Li, 2018) . For this reason, \nwe decided to evaluate the effects of OL and Per -OL on this multiprotein complex modulation \ndeeping in the canonical and non -canonical activation. We observed a significant increment of the \nexpression of ASC and NLRP3 in murine peritoneal macrophages obtain from SLE -induced group, \nbut OL and Per -OL supple mented diet could able to reduce them (* p<0.05 and *** p<0.001 vs. SD -\nsham group; ##p<0.01, ###p<0.001 vs. SD -SLE group).  Indeed, we found that OL and Per -OL \nreduced the maturation and secretion of pro -inflammatory cytokines like IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18, in \ncompar ison with pristane group animals (*** p<0.001 vs. SD -sham group; ###p<0.001 vs. SD -SLE \ngroup) (Fig. 7A). Therefore, we evaluated the activation of caspase -1 in peritoneal macrophages \nobtain from SLE -induced stimulated with LPS, and we could observe a signif icantly reduction of \n  Chapter IV  \n \n151 \n expression of cleaved -caspase -1 with OL and Per -OL supplemented diet (* p<0.05 vs. SD -sham \ngroup; #p<0.05, ##p<0.01 vs. SD -SLE group) (Fig. 7B).  \nTo study the possible implication of non -canonical inflammasome NLRP3 activation, we \nevalu ated the effect of OL and Per -OL in peritoneal macrophages in SLE -induced mice stimulated \nwith LPS, and in this case we only could observed a significantly decrease of caspase -11 activation \nin Per -OL group in comparison with pristane control group (* p<0.05  vs. SD -sham group; #p<0.05 \nvs. SD -SLE group) (Fig. 7B).  \n \n \n \nChapter IV  \n152 \n  \nFigure 7: Effect of OL and Per -OL dietary treatment on NLRP3 inflammasome complex in LPS -\nstimulated macrophages from pristane -induced SLE mice.

DISCUSSION  \n \nIn the present study, we have depth insight into the effects of dietary treatments OL and \nits new lipophilic acetyl  derivative Per -OL on murine peritoneal macrophages from pristane -SLE \nmice, evaluating the clinical, pathological, and mechanistic contribution. Patients with  SLE  show \nan impaired oxidative status and increased levels of IL -1\u03b2, TNF, IL -17 and IL -18, which are closely \nlinked to inflammation and correlated with disease activity (Wu et al. , 2016) . It has been reported  \nthat IL -1\u03b2 can promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion  of other cells via activating \nSTAT3.  Besides, STAT3  signaling plays a crucial role in the Th17 generation and an u pregulated  \nSTAT3 /IL-17 expression  had been described in lupus patients (Che n et al. , 2019) . In the present \nstudy, we found that OL and Per -OL dietary treatments reduced the inflammatory infiltrated in \nkidneys. Anti -inflammatory response was accompanied by a significant reduction of Th1, Th2 and \nTh17 cytokines levels as well as  p-STAT3 downregulation in LPS -stimulated macrophages from OL \nand Per -OL treated SLE mice.  \nOur results are in agreement  with Campolo et al., (Campolo et al. , 2013 ) who observed \nthat OL was capable of reducing the secondary injury associated to intestinal damage attenuating \nTNF -\u03b1 and IL -1\u03b2 production in the ileum from splanchnic arterial occlusion shocked mice. \nSimilarly, administration of OL caused a significant  reduction of TNF -\u03b1 and IL -1\u03b2, in a mouse \nmodel of carrageenan -induced pleurisy (Impellizzeri et al. , 2011) . In addition, Ryu et al. showed \nthat OL reduced  LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in  murine macrophages  by supp ressing \niNOS and COX -2 as well as the release of pro -inflammatory IL -1\u03b2 and IL -6 (Ryu et al. , 2015) . In this \nline, several authors have reported that STAT3  signaling regulates the inhibition of myocardial \nisquemia/reperfusion in rats treated with  OL (Jin et al. , 2018)  and the inflammatory response in \nOL- and Per -OL- treated LPS -induced murine peritoneal macrophages (Castejon et al. , 2019) . \nRecently, it has been described that acute consumption of olive oil decreased the activ ation \nof NF -\u03baB system on mononuclear cells from healthy donors and that OL inhibits LPS -triggered NF -\n\u03baB and activa tor protein (AP) -1 activation. NF -\u03baB induces the expression of various pro -\ninflammatory genes, including those encoding cytokines and chemokin es such as TNF -\u03b1, IL -1\u03b2, IL -  Chapter IV  \n \n153 \n 6, iNOS and COX -2, among others, and also participates in the regulation and assembly of \ninflammasome complex contributing to the initiation and development of inflammatory diseases \n(Liu et al. , 2017) .  \nBy inhibiting the activation of NF -\u03baB, the production of inflammatory mediators under its \ncontrol may be reduced. In this regard, Miles et  al. demonstrated that OL significantly decreased \nthe concentration of IL -1\u03b2 in LPS -stimulated human whole blood culture (Carluccio et al. , 2003; \nMiles, Zoubouli and Calder, 2005; Perez -Martinez et al. , 2007) . Similar results were described in \nhuman synovial fibroblast cell line SW982 where OL as well as the phenolic fraction from EVOO \nexerted anti -inflammatory and anti -oxidant effects via down -regulation of MAPK s and NF -\u03baB \nsignaling pathways and induction of nuclear factor E2 -related factor 2 (Nrf2) -linked h eme \noxygenase -1 (HO -1) controlling the production of inflammatory mediators such as IL -6 and TNF -\u03b1 \ncytokines, metalloproteinase  (MMP )-1 and MMP -3 levels and microsomal prostaglandin E \nsynthase - 1 (mPGEs -1) and COX -2 overexpression (Castejon et al. , 2017; Rosillo et al. , 2019) .  \nThe inflammasome  was described as a large intracellular signaling complex that contains a \ncytosolic pattern recognition receptor, especially a NLRP. Among NLR inflammasome complex, the \nmost characterized is NLRP3 inflammasome (Jo et al. , 2016) . Inflammasome machinery is \ndysregulated in SLE and plays an important role in promotion of organ damage. Maturation and  \nsecretion of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 translation are mediated by inflammasome activated caspase -1 (Shirato \net al. , 2017) . Canonical inflammasome induce inflammatory response by processing inactive \nprocaspase -1 into cleaved cas pase -1. Caspase 1 is able to regulate the maturation of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 \ninto active cytokines which are involved in the lupus injury (Jo et al. , 2016) . Besid es, non -canonical \ninflammasome there is an alternative via which has been described to activate caspase -11, and also \nserve as an additional pathway of maturation and secretion of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 in macrophage -\nmediate immune response (Kayagaki et al. , 2011) . \nWe found, for the first time that  OL and Per -OL dietary treatments inhibited canonical and \nnon-canonical activation of NLRP3 inflammasome/IL -1\u03b2 in murine peritoneal macrophages \nisolated from pristane -SLE mice.  This important finding indicates that OL and Per -OL inhibited \ndisease progression which was at least partly dependent on inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome. \nSimilar data were found after H Ty and peracetylated -hydroxytyrosol ( Per-HTy ) treatments on LPS - \ninduced inflammatory response in murine peritoneal macrophages (Montoya et al. , 2018) .  \nTaken together, OL and Per -OL exerted a protective effect against inflammatory lupic \nresponse in muri ne peritoneal macrophages from pristane -SLE mice via STAT3 and NF -\u03baB \nsignaling expression coupled with  inhibition of canonical and non -canonical NLRP3 \ninflammasome.  \n \n Chapter IV  \n154 \n  \nReferences  \n\uf0b7 Aparicio -Soto, M. et al.

Por lo tanto, la terapia nutricional puede constituir una interesante alternativa \npara el tratamiento del LES, debido a sus potenciales beneficios sin los efectos adversos asociados a \nla farmacoterapia cl\u00e1sica. Los extractos de la hoja del olivo tienen un alto inter\u00e9s debi do a sus \nm\u00faltiples efectos terap\u00e9uticos. La oleurope\u00edna (OL) es el componente mayoritario de los extractos \nde las hojas del olivo y posee muchas propiedades beneficiosas.  \nEn este estudio, evaluamos los efectos de dos dietas suplementadas con OL y un deriva do \nsemisint\u00e9tico, oleurope\u00edna peracetilada (Per -OL) en un modelo de LES inducido por pristano en \nratones BALB/c.  \nLos ratones recibieron una inyecci\u00f3n intraperitoneal de pristano o soluci\u00f3n salina seg\u00fan \nlos grupos experimentales y fueron alimentados con di etas experimentales enriquecidas con OL y \ncon Per -OL.

Olive leaf extracts are of \nspecial interest for their therapeutic effects. Oleuropein (OL) is the most abundant constituents of \nolive leaf extract and possess many beneficial properties . \nIn this study, we evaluated the effects of dietary OL and its new derivate, Peracetylated oleuropein \n(Per-OL), in a pristane -induced SLE model.  \nMice received an injection of pristane or saline solution and were fed with experimental diets: \nenriched with OL and Per -OL. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines and markers were \nevaluated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protein expressions of nitric oxide \nsynthase inducible (iNOS), microsomal prostaglandin E synth ase 1 ( mPGEs -1), heme oxygena se-1 \n(HO -1), nuclear factor E2 -related factor 2 (Nrf2), mitogen -activated protein kinases (MAPKs), Janus \nkinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), nuclear transcription factor -\nkappa B (NF -\u03baB) and inflammasome nucleotide -binding do main, leucine -rich repeats -containing \nfamily, pyrin domain -containing -3 (NLRP3) pathways activation were determined in kidneys by \nWestern Blot.  \nOL and Per -OL significantly reduced renal damage and decreased serum matrix metalloproteinase \n3 (MMP -3) and pros taglandin  E2 (PGE 2) kidneys  levels. Our findings indicate that Nrf2 and HO -1 \nantioxidant protein expressions were up -regulated in mice fed with OL and Per -OL diets, whereas \nthe activation of JAK/STAT, MAPK, NF -\u03baB and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways were \nsignif icantly ameliorated.  \nThese results suggest that OL and Per -OL supplementation might provide a new \nalternative approach as a preventive/palliative treatment of nephritis in SLE management.  \n  Chapter V  \n \n161 \n  \n \nKEYWORDS:  HO-1/Nrf2; inflammasome; lupus nephritis; MAPK; NF -kB; oleuropein.  \n \n \n \n \n1. INTRODUCTION  \n \nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, characterized by \ndifferences in autoantibody profile, serum cytokines, and a multi -system involvement commonly \naffecting the skin, musculoskeletal, and hematopoietic systems clinical ma nifestations involving  \nwith a special importance of the renal damage (Goulielmos et al. , 2018) . Pathogenic drivers of SLE \nare multifactorial and are not fu lly known.  Interaction of genetic susceptibility with environmental \nand potential stochastic factors leads to an early break of immune tolerance with preclinical \nautoimmunity (Rose and D\u00f6rner, 2017) . Immunological abnormalities includes imbalance of T-\nhelper -cell (Th) subsets (Th1/Th2/Th17) and regulatory T -cells (Treg), resulting in a loss of self -\ntolerance, activation of auto reactive T and B cells and  production of large amounts of pro -\nChapter V  \n162 \n inflammatory cytokines whi ch contribute actively to tissue damage and local inflammation \n(Miyake, Akahoshi and Nakashima, 2011) . \nPrevious studies have demonstrated that the molecular signaling pathways involved in \nSLE include nuclear factor -kappa B (NF-\u03baB), mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAPK s), Janus \nkinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (JAK/STAT) ,  nuclear  factor \nE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/ heme oxygenase -1 (HO -1)  pathways. More recently,   the nucleotide -\nbinding domain, leucine -rich repeats -containing family, pyrin domain -containing -3 (NLRP3) \ninflammasome which integrates caspase -1 activation resulting in the cleavage of  pro -inflammatory \ncytokines such a s interleukin (IL) -1\u03b2 and IL -18 precursors to their mature forms and their eventual \nsecretion induces pyroptotic cell death, which contributing to both, host defense and sterile \ninflammation  (Schroder and Tschopp, no date; Kury\u0142owi cz and Nauman, 2008; Kawasaki et al. , \n2011; Lorenz, Darisipudi and Anders, 2014; Nie et al. , 2015; Zhao et al. , 2015; Aparicio -Soto, \nS\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo and Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra, 2017; Liu et al. , 2018) .   \nThe treatments of SLE include a numerous options li ke as corticosteroids, \nimmunosuppressive drugs and cell -based therapies. Despite of the improvements in care, patients \nusually suffer a loss of quality of life due to the long -used of these medications (Aparicio -Soto et al. , \n2016) . Therefore, more effective and less toxic therapies for SLE are required. For this purpose, the \ninterest on nutritional therapy and dietary supplements is currently increasing.  Phenolic  \ncompounds, which are typically included in Mediterranean diet through extra virgin olive oil \n(EVOO), olives and wine, have shown a wide range of bioactive properties. In this context, our \nresearch group have previously demonstrated the  anti -inflammatory and  immunomodulatory  \nproperties  of  hydroxytyrosol (HTy), tyrosol (Ty), hydroxytyrosyl acetate  (HTy -Ac), oleocanthal \nand oleuropein (OL) on  lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages \n(Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2014)  on  IL -1\u03b2-stimulated human synovial fibroblasts cell line SW982 \n(Castej\u00f3n et al. , 2017; Rosillo et al. , 2017)  and  on  experimental models of chronic autoimmune \ndiseases such as SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (Cardeno et al. , 2014; \nRosillo et al. , 2014; Aparicio -Soto et al., 2015) .  \nOL is the main secoiridoid component of olive leaves, roots and unprocessed olive drupes, \nwhich is hydrolysed by endogenous \u03b2 -glucosidases during fruit maturation and forms different \nproducts, including HTy. It contributes to the bitter tas te and stability of olive oil  and functions as \na hydrophilic phenolic antioxidant (Cornwell and Ma, 2008; Barbaro et al. , 2014; Imran et al. , 2018) . \nPrevious studies have reported its antioxidant, anti -inflammatory, anti -allergic, anti -atherogenic, \nanti-thrombotic, and anti -mutagenic effects (Barbaro et al. , 2014; Gorzynik -Debicka et al. , 2018; \nNassir et al. , 2019; Zhang and Zhang, 2019) . In fact, OL was able to suppre ss inflammatory response \non LPS-stimulated RAW 264 (Ryu et al. , 2015; Mao et al. , 2019) . Also it has been shown to exert a \nsignificantly protective effects in a mo use model of carrageenan -induced pleurisy (Impellizzeri et   Chapter V  \n \n163 \n al., 2011)  , on cartilage slowing down the progression of osteoarthritic lesions in Guinea pigs \n(Horcajada et al. , 2015) , and  in  several models of neuroinflammation (Hornedo -Ortega et al. , 2018) . \nBesides, some studies have shown the importance of acetyl  derivatives of natural phenols \ndue to their lipophilic nature allows them to cross the cytoplasmic cell membranes and their uptake \nby cells, providing a potential  protection of membrane constituents. Thus, this increased \nlipophilicity means that peracetyl ated -oleuropein (Per -OL) could be better absorbed across \nintestinal epithelial cell monolayers than OL. Also a de acetyl ation step by lipases of the human \ndigestive system may delay the excretion process (Stamatopoulos, Chatzilazarou and Katsoyannos, \n2013) . Besides, acetyl -derivatives  have shown anti -inflammatory activities greater than parent \ncompounds putting  in evidence a strict correlation between lipo philicity and bioavailability (de \nAra\u00fajo et al. , 2017; Rizzo et al. , 2017) . Consequently, the acetyl ation may improve \npharmacodynamics  and pharmacokinetics profiles compared to the natural compound  and it \ncould be an appealing strategy in the management of different inflammatory process (Montoya et \nal., 2018) .  \nTaking this into account, the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential \neffects of OL and its new acetyl -derivative, Per -OL, enriched -diets in murine pristane -induced \nnephritis on the production of inflammatory mediators focusing into the action mechanisms and \nsignaling pathways involved after dietary treatments.  \n \n \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n \n2.1. Reagents  \n \nOL was extracted according to reported literature (Stamatopoulos, Chatzilazarou a nd \nKatsoyannos, 2013) , following the purification by column chromatography (CH 2Cl2-MeOH \n10:1\u21925:1) to give the product as a yellow solid. The synthesis of Per -OL was carried out from OL. It \nwas solved and stirred in a mixture of 1:1 (v/v) pyridine/acetic  anhydride at 8\u00baC for 10 min. Then, \nthe reaction was kept at room temperature overnight. After hydrolysing the acetic anhydride, the \nsolution was concentrated to dryness obtaining a residue that was purified by column \nchromatography (EtOAc -C. Hexane 1:1) t o give the product (quant.) as a brown solid. Spectroscopy \ndata was identical to reported literature (Procopio AS   M.; Costa, N.; Nardi, M., 2008) .  \n \n2.2. Pristane induction of SLE -like disease  \n \nSixteen -weeks -old BALB/c mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mL pristane \n(99% pure, Sigma Aldrich Co\u00ae, St Louis, MO, USA) to induce SLE according to previous described \nprocedure by Satoh and Reeves, 1994 (Satoh and Reeves, 1994) . After 24 weeks (experimental \nperiod), animals were sacrificed and blood and kidneys were collected.  \n Chapter V  \n164 \n 2.3. Animals and diets  \n \nTo evaluate the beneficial effects of OL and Per -OL on pristine -SLE induced model, 60 \ntwelve -week -old BALB/c mice (27.32 \u00b1 0.37 g) were used (Janvier Labs\u00ae, Saint -Berthevin Cedex, \nFrance). Mice were maintained under constant conditions of temperature (20 -25 \u00baC) and humidity \n(40-60%) with a lighting regimen of 12L/12D. They were fed with standard rodent diet (Panlab \nA04\u00ae, Seville, Spain) and water ad libitum until SLE -like disease pristane induction.  \nMice were randomized in four experimental groups: (i) Sham group  were fed with \nstandard diet (SD) (SD -sham group) (n=10), (ii) pristane group  received SD (SD-SLE group) (n=20), \n(iii) pristane OL group (OL) were fed with SD supplement with OL (100 mg/kg diet) (n=15) and \n(iv) pristane Per -OL group (Per -OL)  were fed with SD supplement with Per-OL (100 mg/kg diet) \n(n=15). Fresh diets were provided every day, an d experimental diets were formulated on the basis \nof the American Instituted of Nutrition (AIN) standard reference diet, and were prepared by \nmixing the pertinent compounds and stored at -80\u00baC.  \nMice were fed with the related diets along six months. Weight, water and food \nconsumption were monitored weekly. The food consumption was on average 4 g/day, with an \nestimated intake of 4 mg of OL or Per -OL per mice, in accordance with previous data (Aparicio -\nSoto et al. , 2017) . All animal care and experimental procedures complied with the Guidelines of the \nEuropean Union regarding animal experimentation (Directive of the European Counsel \n2010 /630/EU) and followed a protocol approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the \nUniversity of Seville.  \n \n2.4. Histological studies of renal tissue  \n \nKidneys were collected, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. Samples \nwere sagittally sectioned at 5 \u00b5m and stained with Masson trichrome and periodic acid -Schiff \n(PAS); four samples per animal containing both cortex and medulla were selected  for evaluation. \nMorphological changes were evaluated by two different observers who were unaware of the \ntreatment group. Results are expressed as percentages of cases exhibiting histological changes.  \n \n2.5. Measurement of inflammatory markers  \n \nBloods were harv ested directly from the heart of mice, allowed to clot for 2 h at room \ntemperature and centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 rpm, 20 \u00baC and stored at -80\u00baC. Enzyme -linked \nimmunoassay (ELISA) kits were used to determine serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase 3 \n(MM P-3) (R&D Systems\u00ae, Abingdon, UK) . Frozen kidney tissues were weighed and homogenized \nin ice -cold protease -inhibitor buffer. Homogenates were centrifuged (4000 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C), and the \nsupernatants were used for the determination of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) (Cayman Chemical  \nCompany\u00ae, Ann Arbor, MI, USA ) and IL -1\u03b2 (BD OptEIA\u00ae, San Jose, CA) levels using the ELISA kit   Chapter V  \n \n165 \n according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. All measurements were carried out in duplicate. The \nresults were measured in picograms per milliliter at 450 nm using an ELISA microplate reader \n(BioTek\u00ae,  Bad Friedrichshall, Germany).  \n \n2.6. Immunoblotting  \n \nProtein concentration was measured of kidney homogenates using a protein assay reagent \n(BioRad\u00ae, M\u00fanchen, Germany) according to Bradford\u2019s method (Bradford, 1976) . Aliquots of these \nsupernatants which contains equal amount of protein (50\u03bcg) were separated on 10 -15% acrylamide \ngel by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrophoretically \ntransferred into a nitrocellulose membrane and in cubated with specific primary antibodies: rabbit \nanti-iNOS (Cayman\u00ae, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) (1:1000); mouse anti -pSTAT3, mouse anti -pJNK, rabbit \nanti-JNK, mouse anti -pp38, rabbit anti -p38, (Cell Signaling  Technology\u00ae, Danvers, MA, USA) \n(1:1000); rabbit polycl onal anti p -ERK and mouse anti -ERK\u00bd, rabbit anti -HO1 and rabbit anti -Nrf2 \n(Cell Signaling  Technology\u00ae, Danvers, MA, USA) (1:500), mouse anti -NLRP3, mouse anti -ASC and \nrabbit anti -Caspase -1 (Cell Signaling  Technology\u00ae, Danvers, MA, USA) (1:500, 1:100, 1:400 , \nrespectively), rabbit anti -Caspase -11 (novus Biologicals\u00ae, Littleton, CO, USA), rabbit anti -IL-18 \n(AbCam\u00ae, Cambridge, UK) (1:500) ,rabbit anti - mPGEs -1 (Cayman\u00ae, Chemical Company, Ann \nArbor, MI, USA) (1:500), rabbit anti -I\u03baB-\u03b1 and rabbit anti -NF\u03baB -p65 (C ell Signaling  Technology\u00ae, \nDanvers, MA, USA) (1:1000) overnight at 4\u00baC. Then, after rising, membranes were incubated with a \nhorseradish peroxidise (HRP) -labelled secondary antibody anti -rabbit (Cayman\u00ae, Chemical \nCompany, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) (1:50000) or an ti-mouse (Dako\u00ae Cytomation, USA) (1:50000) \ncontaining blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. To prove equal loading, the blots were \nanalysed for \u03b2 -actin expression using an anti -b-actin antibody (Sigma \u2013Aldrich\u00ae, MO, USA). \nImmunodetection was perfor med using enhanced chemiluminescence light -detecting kit (Pierce\u00ae, \nRockford, IL, USA). The immunosignals were captured using Amersham Imager 600 (GE \nHealthcare\u00ae, Buckinghamshire, UK), and densitometric data were studied following normalization \nto the housekeeping loading control. The signals were analysed and quantified by an Image \nProcessing and Analysis in Java (Image J\u00ae, Softonic) and expressed in relation to SD -SLE control \ngroup.  \n \n2.7. Statistical evaluation  \n \nAll values in the figures and text are expr essed as arithmetic means \u00b1 standard error of the \nmean (S.E.M.).  Data were evaluated with Graph Pad Prism\u00ae Version 5.04 software (San Diego, CA, \nUSA). The statistical significance of any difference in each parameter among the groups was \nevaluated by one -way analysis of variance followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple -comparisons test as post \nhoc test. P values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In the experiments involving Chapter V  \n166 \n densitometry, the figures shown are representative of at least four different  experiments performed \non different days.  \n \n3. RESULTS  \n \n3.1. OL and Per -OL diets ameliorated renal abnormalities in SLE -pristane induced BALB/c mice  \n \nAs shown in Figure 1, in control group or treated with OL or Per -OL diets there were no \nobvious kidney alterations showing a significant improvement of the cytoarchitecture. However, \nmost mice of SD -SLE group presented some degree of renal abnormalities in comparison with SD -\nsham group, ranging from abundant inflammatory mononuclear cells in the renal interstitium to \nrenal interstitial fibrosis. In relation to renal interstitial fibrosis, it also increased in pristane -treated \nmice and per sisted randomly after OL and Per -OL diets  but generally at less magnitude (Fig 1 E -F). \nThe presence of scattered renal tubules filled with protein aggregates (\u201cthyroidization\u201d) was also \nobserved in around of 20% of the pristane treated -mice, however, it was rather maintained after \ndifferent diets . \nOil granulomas were frequently observed in peritoneum of pristane -treated mice which \nwere not modified after OL and Per -OL diets (Fig 1 G -H).  Finally, an outstanding finding was the \npresence of large lightly stained areas of renal tubules in pristane -treated mice (10%), that \nconsiderably increased after OL (80%) and Per -OL (70%) diets (Fig 1 I -L). These hyaline -like renal \ntubule areas were not positive for the PAS technique, discarding their mucous nature.  \n \n           \n \n  Chapter V  \n \n167 \n Figure 1.

The presence of fibrosis (E -F), peritoneum oil granulomas (G -H) and hyaline -like renal tubule \nareas (I -L) can be observed in kidneys. Bar: A -H = 20 \u00b5m; I -L= 10\u00b5m.  \n \n3.2. OL and Per -OL supplemented diets decreased  serum lev els of MMP -3 in prista ne-induced SLE  \n \nIt has been reported that lupus nephritis and its progression might depend on the \ndisintegration of the membrane due to the effects of MMP activities. To evaluate the effects of OL \nand Per -OL supplemented diets in MMP -3 levels in SLE, serum levels of MMP -3 were measured \nafter sacrifice. In SD -SLE group, MMP -3 serum levels were considerably increased compared with \nsham group (** p<0.01 vs. SD -sham group). On the contrary, serum MMP -3 levels were significantly \nlower in animals which were fed with OL and Per -OL diet in comparison with  SD-SLE group \n(##p<0.01 vs. SD -SLE group). Nevertheless, no significant statistical differences betwee n OL or Per -\nOL treatments were observed (Figure 2).  \n \n                       \n \nFigure 2 . OL and Per -OL diets reduced the serum levels of MMP -3 from pristane -induced SLE \nmice . Serum samples from mice in each group were collected at the end of the experiment and the MMP -3 \nlevels were detected by ELISA. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. (n=10). ** p<0.01 vs. SD -sham group; \n##p<0.01 vs. SD -SLE group.  \n \n \nChapter V  \n168 \n 3.3. Effects of OL and Per -OL supplemented diets on inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) and \nmicrosomal prostaglandin E synthase -1 (mPGEs -1) protein expression and PGE 2 production in \nkidney in prista ne-induced SLE  \n \nPristane -induced SLE is characterized by an increasing of iNOS expression in kidney (Botte et \nal., 2014) . Accordingly, iNOS expression was increasing in SD -SLE group mice in comparison with \nSD-sham group (** p<0.01 vs. SD -sham group). Furthermore, the expression of this parameter was \nsignificantly d ecreased in animals fed with Per -OL supplemented diet, in comparison with pristane \ngroup (##p<0.01 vs. SD -SLE group) whereas OL -SLE group showed similar levels to SD -Sham \ngroup (Figure 3A).   \nIn other hand, previous studies have demonstrated that mPGEs -1 and PGE 2, play an important \nrole in inflammatory kidney injury (Lazarus et al. , 2001; Suganami et al. , 2003) . To determine \nwhether OL and Per -OL diet could modulate PGs, we analyzed mPGEs -1 protein expression and \nkidney PGE 2 levels production. Both parameters were considerably augmented in pristane group in \ncomparison with sham group (** p<0.01; *** p<0.001 vs. SD -sham group), h owever, a significant \nreduction was observed in animals which were fed with experimental diets (OL and Per -OL) in \ncomparison with SD -SLE group (#p<0.05; ##p<0.01; ###p<0.001 vs. SD -SLE group) showing similar \nlevels to SD -Sham group (Figure 3B).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \nA)   Chapter V  \n \n169 \n  \n \nFigure 3 .

(B) OL and Per -OL diet down -regulated the mPGEs -1 protein expression and PGE 2 production in \nkidneys from pristane -induced SLE mice . PGE 2 levels were determined by ELISA. Data are represented as \nmean \u00b1 S.E.M. (n=10). Proteins obtained from kidney tissues of OL and Per -OL treated mice were analyzed by \nwestern blot using specific antibody against iNOS and mPGEs -1. Densitometry analysis was performing \nfollowing normalization to the control (\u03b2 -actin housekeeping gene). Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 S.E.M. \n(n=6). ** p<0.01,*** p<0.001 vs. SD -sham group; #p<0.05, ##p<0.01, ###p<0.001 vs. SD -SLE group.  \n \n \n \n3.4. OL and Per-OL supplemented diets down -regulated HO -1 protein expression via Nrf2 activation \nin kidney from of SLE -pristane induced BALB/c mice  \n \nTo recognize whether up -regulation o f Nrf -2-dependent signa ling by OL and Per -OL \nsupplemented diets could diminish renal inflammation in pristane -induced kidney damage, we \nmeasured Nrf -2 and HO -1 protein expressions by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4, protein \nexpressions of HO -1 and Nfr2 were significantly do wn-regulated in pristane group compared with \nsham group (* p<0.05 vs. SD -sham group). Nonetheless, OL supplemented diet produced an \nincrement of the expression of Nrf2 in comparison with pristane group (##p<0.01 vs. SD -SLE \ngroup), while a significant up -regulation of both proteins were detected in Per-OL supplemented \ndiet (##p<0.01; ###p<0.001 vs. SD -SLE group).  \n \nB) Chapter V  \n170 \n  \n \nFigure 4 .

OL and Per -OL diets modulates signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT )-3, NF-\u03baB \nand MAPKs  signaling pathways in pristane -induced SLE  \n \nTo have to delve in the study of mechanisms underlying in the effects of OL and Per -OL \ndiet anti -inflammatory effects in SLE model, we also determined the role of STAT -3, NF -\u03baB and \nMAPK signaling pathways. According to our results, we observed a markedly increment of p -\nSTAT -3 expression in SD -SLE group compared with SD -sham group (*** p<0.001 vs. SD -sham \ngroup), bu t this parameter were significantly down -regulated with OL and Per -OL diet (#p<0.05 vs. \nSD-SLE group) (Fig. 5A).  \nAlso, as shown in Fig. 5B, we observed an important degradation of the inhibitor  of NF -\u03baB \n(I\u03baB)-\u03b1 in kidney in pristane group mice (** p<0.01 v s. SD -sham group); nonetheless, Per -OL diet \nwas able to prevent its degradation after pristane injection (#p<0.05 vs. SD -SLE group). For other \nhand, p65 translocation into the nucleus was remarkably increased after pristane injection (** p<0.01 \nvs. SD -sham group), whereas OL and Per -OL supplemented diet were able to prevent the nuclear \nmigration (##p<0.01 vs. SD -SLE group). Similarly, we observed an increase of p38, C-jun NH 2-\nterminal kinase  (JNK ) and extracellular signal -regulated kinase ( ERK ) phosphorylation after \npristane injection (** p<0.01; *** p<0.001 vs. SD -sham group). On the contrary, there was a significant \n  Chapter V  \n \n171 \n prevention of MAPK s phosphorylation in OL and Per -OL groups (#p<0.05; ##p<0.01; ###p<0.001 vs. \nSD-SLE group) (Fig.5C).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter V  \n172 \n  \n  \nFigure 5.

(C) \nDietary treatment of OL and Per -OL down -regulated the renal expression levels of pp38, pJNK and pERK 1/2 \nMAP kinases in pristane -induced SLE mice.  Densitometry analysis was performed following normalization to \nthe control (p38 , JNK and ERK 1/2 housekeeping genes, respectively). Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 S.E.M. \n(n=6).  **p<0.01, *** p<0.001 vs.SD -sham group; #p<0.05, ##p<0.01 and ###p<0.001 vs. SD -SLE group.  \n \n \n3.6. Effects of OL and Per -OL diet on inflammasome: canonical and non-canonical signaling \npathways in pristane -induced SLE  \n \nRecent studies suggest that inflammasome complex is dysregulated in SLE, playing an \nimportant role in promotion of organ damage and development of lupus pathologies (Kahlenberg  \nand Kaplan, 2014) . For this reason, we decided to study the effects of OL and Per -OL on this \nmultiprotein complex modulation. The NLRP3 inflammasome complex, comprising NLRP3, \napoptotic speck protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and c ysteine aspartic acid \nprotease 1 (Caspase 1) (Li et al. , 2018) .  \nIn our studi es, we observed how pristane injection produced an important increased of IL -\n18 (* p<0.05 vs. SD -sham group), IL -1\u03b2 levels (*** p<0.001 vs. SD -sham group) and NLRP3 expression \n(*p<0.05 vs. SD -sham group); nevertheless, these parameters were down -regulated wi th OL and \n  Chapter V  \n \n173 \n Per-OL supplemented diet (#p<0.05; ##p<0.01; ### p<0.001 vs. SD -SLE group). Furthermore, ASC \nexpression were notably augmented in pristane group compared with sham group (*** p<0.001 vs. \nSD-sham group) whereas OL and Per -OL supplemented diet group  had a significant down -\nregulation of its expression (###p<0.001 vs. SD -SLE group) (Fig. 6A).  \nAlso, we have studied the canonical inflammasome activation through the caspase -1 \nprotein expression. We have observed a remarkably increment of cleaved caspase -1 in SD -SLE mice \nin comparison with SD -sham group (* p<0.05 vs. SD -sham group), but it has been modulated with \nenriched -diets (#p<0.05 vs. SD -SLE group). We could not observe any significant changes in pro -\ncaspase -1 expression in any experimental groups (Fi g. 6B).  \nAccording to Kayagaki et al., (Kayagaki et al. , 2011) ,  there is an alternative mechanism for \ncaspase -1 activation: the non -canonical inflammasome pathway, which involves caspase -11 to \nactivate procaspase -11 and the subsequent release IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 (Montoy a et al. , 2018) . Non -\ncanonical effects of NLRP3 and ASC also could contribute to lupus nephritis (Lorenz, Darisipudi \nand Anders, 2014) . Taking this into account, we decided to determine the OL and Per -OL diet \neffects on non -canonical inflammasome pathway through the caspase -11 activation. In Fig. 6C, we \nrepresented the pr ocaspase -11 partially cleaves and cleaved caspase -11 after pristane injection \n(*p<0.05; *** p<0.001 vs. SD -sham group). We could demonstrated that Per -OL supplemented diet \nwas a significant down -regulation of caspase -11 protein expression (procaspase and cl eaved forms) \nin comparison with SD -SLE group (#p<0.05; ##p<0.01 vs. SD -SLE group).  \n \n \nChapter V  \n174 \n  \n \nFigure 6:  Effect of OL and Per -OL dietary treatment on NLRP3 inflammasome complex in kidneys \nfrom pristane -induced SLE mice. (A) OL and Per -OL diet modulated NLRP3, ASC and IL -18 protein expression \nlevels, and down -regulation IL -1\u03b2 levels in kidneys from pristane -induced SLE mice.

(B) OL and Per -OL dietary treatment modulated canonical and non -canonical inflammasome pathway \n(C) in kidneys from pristane -induced SLE mice.

DISCUSSION  \n \nSLE is as autoimmune disease, characterized by autoantibody generation, immune \ncomplexes, autoreactive or inflammatory T cells and inflammatory cytokines that may initiate and \namplify inflammation and damage to var ious organs  such as kidney contributing to the clinical \nmanifestations of SLE (Aparicio -Soto, S \u00e1nchez -Hidalgo and Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra, 2017; Xu and Li, \n2018) .  \nWe have demonstrated, for the first time,  that OL and Per -OL supplemented diets could \nmodulate SLE on pristane -induced  model in mice, specifically preventing renal injury through  \nmodul ating  NF -\u03baB, STAT3 and MAPKs signaling pathways, and inhibiting the NLRP3 \ninflammasome complex.  \nPristane -treated mice presented some degree of renal abnormalities in comparison with \ncontrol mice, ranging from abundant inflammatory mononuclear cells in th e renal interstitium to \nrenal interstitial fibrosis.  On the contrary, kidneys  from   pristane -treated mice fed  with OL and \nPer-OL showed  a significant improvement of the  renal cytoarchitecture,  The appearance of \n  Chapter V  \n \n175 \n hyaline -like renal tubule areas after pristane treatment and, preferably, after administration of oil \ndiets, has not been previously referenced in the literature, excepting by Ruan et al. (Ruan et al. , \n2016)  that described the presence of a large lightly stained mucous -like substance. The histological \naspects of renal tissue in our studies were very similar to those described by Ruan et al. but being \nthem PAS negative, their mucous nature is questionable (Ruan et al. , 2016) . \nThe MMPs  are a family of zinc -dependent enzymes that degrade different components of \nextracellular matrix acting on pro -inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other proteins \nregulating varied aspects of inflammation and immunity (Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2017) . Particularly, \nMMP -3 (stromelysin) levels were markedly elevated in SLE. with a possible role in the \npathogenesis of lupus nephritis (Gheita et al. , 2015) . Accordingly with  our previous findings \n(Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2016, 2017) . MMP3 serum levels were increased in SD -SLE mice wh ich, \nhowever serum MMP -3 levels were significantly reduced in those pristane -treated mice that \nreceived OL and Per -OL enriched -diets  contributing to minimize pristane -induced renal damage.  \nPGE 2 is a bioactive lipid mediator biosynthetised by mPGEs -1 (Schneider, Boeglin and \nBrash, 2004) , whi ch   plays a crucial role in the development of  inflammatory response, acting as a \nmediator of  Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines  and it has been implicated in the glomerular filtration \nregulation (Imig, Breyer and Breyer, 2002; Adamik et al. , 2013) . Besides, PGE 2 high urinary levels of \nthis prostanoid have been reported in lupus nephritis (Herrera -Marcos et al. , 2017) . In  previous \nstudies by our research  group  (Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2016, 2017)  high levels o f PGE 2 and mPGEs -1 \nprotein expression were found in pristane -induced SLE  mice. However, both parameters were \nsignificant reduced in renal tissue of pristane -induced animals that were received OL and Per -OL \nsupplemented diet in comparison with those animals whic h were fed with SD The generation of \nreactive nitrogen species (RNS)  and  reactive oxygen species (ROS)  has a wide impact in acute and \nchronic kidney injuries in patients with lupus nephritis.  In fact, nitric oxide (NO) is overproduced \nin the setting of lupus activity (Oates and Gilkeson, 2006 ). NO works as  an intracellular messenger \nwhich  regulates the formation of  ROS and RNS synchronizing the inflammatory response \n(Montoya et al. , 2018) . Our results showed, accordingly with previous studies (Jiang et al. , 2014)  that \niNOS expression was remarkably increased in  kidneys from SD -SLE mice, however experimental \ndiets enriched with OL and Per -OL could restore reduced iNOS expression.  \nNrf2 signaling pathway is a crucial regulator of the antioxidant response  in mammalian \ncells in response to endogenous and exogenous stress (Yu et al. , 2014)  modulating the transcription \nof antioxidant genes, including HO -1. The induction of antioxidant enzymes has been consider ed to \nbe adaptive cellular responses to oxidative stress (Lv et al. , 2018) .  Previous studies have \ndemonstrated  that Nrf2 improves lupus nephritis  in a pristane - induced SLE model  by neutralizing \nreactive oxygen species and by negatively regulating the NF -\u03baB in patients with SLE. In addition, a \nsignificant decrease in HO -1 expression (Jiang et al. , 2014) , specifically in monocytes  (Herrada et al. , Chapter V  \n176 \n 2012)  has been found,  thus HO-1 induction  could ameliorate  lupus nephritis, probably by \nmultiple mechanisms including NO synthesis suppression, inhibition of antibody production and \nmodulation of cytokine production (Takeda et al. , 2004) .  In our studies, OL and Per -OL dietary \ntreatments strongly could reestablish Nrf2 and HO -1 expressions conferring a role of Nrf2/HO -1 \nsignaling  in the beneficial effects of dietary OL and Per -OL in this SLE model.  Furthermore,  these \ndata are in agreement with  our  previous results  in  pristine - induced SLE model (Aparicio -Soto et \nal., 2016, 2017; Rosillo et al. , 2016) . According to the results, Jiang et al., (Jiang et al. , 2014)  had \nestablished that Nrf2 inhibits SLE devel opment of lupus by suppressing NF -\u03baB-mediated \ninflammatory response as well.  \nNF-\u03baB is a redox sensitive transcription factor which controls the expression of several \ngenes involved in inflammatory responses such as pro -inflammatory cytokines including  tumor \nnecrosis factor ( TNF )-\u03b1, IL -1, 6 and IL -17 and is crucial in  self-reactive T - and B -lymphocyte, \nsurvival and proliferation  in lupus development (Okamoto, 2006) . In this sense, lower I\u03baB -\u03b1 protein \nand high  p65 expressions have  been observed after pristane injection. However, kidneys from \npristane mice fed with either OL or Per -OL showed similar I\u03baB -\u03b1 than in SD -sham group. In \naccordance with these results, p65 translocation was also reduced in OL and Per -OL groups \ncompared to p ristane group mice. These results are in agreement with our previous findings where \nother olive oil polyphenols supplemented diets increased I\u03baB -\u03b1 expression and reduced p65 \nnuclear translocation in pristane models of SLE. (Sanchez -Fidalgo et al. , 2010; Rosillo et al. , 2015; \nAparicio -Soto et al. , 2016) . Thus, our data suggest that dietary OL and Per -OL may protect against \nlupus nephritis by activating Nrf -2/HO -1 inhibiting the activation of the NF -\u03baB pathway and \ndeposition of extracellular matrix.  \nMAPK s family members (p38 kinases, ERK 1/2 and JNK ) are implicated in several cell \nprocesses such as regulation of the synthesis of  cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molec ules and \nPGs involved in the regulation of autoimmune response (Thalhamer, McGrath and Harnett, 2007) . \nImportantly, MAPKs phosphorylate the STAT3, important in pro -inflammatory cytokine -mediated \nsignaling pathways leading to STAT3 activation by phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, resulting \nin the formation of STAT dimers that translocate into the nucleus to bind specific deoxyribonucleic \nacid ( DNA ) sequences (Wang, Cherukuri and Luo, 2005) . Our findings show that STAT3 and \nMAPKs phosphorylation were increased in kidneys from SLE pristane mice; however, dietary OL \nand Per -OL supplementation significantly reduce  both STAT3 and MAPKs activation at \ntranscriptional level. Altogether, our results suggest that dietary OL and Per -OL may ameliorate \ninflammatory biomarkers production interfering negatively with JNK, p38, ERK MAPKs and \nSTAT -3 signaling pathways . \nOn the oth er hand, inflammasomes are multi -protein complexes associated with several \nimmune, inflammatory and auto -inflammatory diseases which use a central support and adaptor   Chapter V  \n \n177 \n molecules to recruit and activate caspase -1 and caspase -11. Canonical inflammasomes induc e \ninflammatory response by processing inactive procaspase -1 into cleaved active caspase -1 (Montoya \net al. , 2018) . These canonical inflammasomes contain the nucleotide -binding oligomeriza tion \ndomain (NOD) -like receptor, the adapter molecule ASC  and caspase -1 (Liu, Berthier and \nKahlenberg, 2017) . Then, active caspase -1 cleaves the pro -inflammatory cytokines IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 \nto their actives forms which are known to contribute directly to the inflammatory injury in lupus.  \nDifferent types of NLR family members, such as NLRP 4, NLRP1, NLRP3 and AIM2 have \nbeen identified (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014) . Increased expression of NLRP3 and caspase -1, among \nothers inflammasome components has been reported in lupus nephritis biopsies (Kahlenberg et al. , \n2011) , suggesting that this tissue may be aware for inflammasome activation. The way in which the \ninflammsome is triggered in LES is an important concept to understand its role in this dise ase. It \nhas been shown that inmmune complexed formed secondary to antibody recognition of DNA or \nribonucleic acid ( RNA ) antigens stimulate inflammasome activation through upregulation of Toll-\nlike receptor ( TLR )-dependent activation of NF -\u03baB and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 \ninflammasome (Kahlenberg and Kaplan, 2014) . In this line, in previous studies, it has been reported \nan increment of inflammasome components expression, including  NLRP3 and caspase -1 in lupus \nnephritis biopsies, suggesting that this tissue may be primed for inflammasome activation \n(Kahlenberg and Kaplan, 2014) . Similarly, maturation and secretion of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 translation \nare mediated by inflammsome activated caspase -1 (Shirato et al. , 2017) . \nIn our study, we observed that pristane -induced SLE significantly increased NLRP3, ASC \nand caspase 1 protein expression , leading to the release of IL -1\u03b2 and IL - 18, whereas only Per -OL \nsupplemented diet could reduce NLRP3 -ASC -inflammasome -activated caspase -1 cleavage  \ninhibiting the canonical inflammasome pathway.  Changes on immunosignals of active forms of \ncaspase -1 (pro -caspase -1 and caspase -1) were not observe d after OL dietary treatment.  For other \nhand, the non -canonical inflammasome, an alternative mechanism, has been described  to activate \ncaspase -11 enzyme and  in turn  induce not only pyroptosis but also serves as an additional \npathway for maturation and secretion of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 in  macrophage -mediated innate immune \nresponses (Kayagaki et al. , 2011) . Our data shown like pro -caspase -11 and caspase -11 activation was \ninduced by pristane. Nevertheless,  Per-OL treatment could inhibit NLRP3 -inflammasome -activated \ncaspase -11 cleavage . Our results have demonstrated a decreasing of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 levels, \nprobably as a consequence of NLRP3 down -regulation, highlighting the importance of the NLRPs \nregulation of avoiding inflammasome activation and  therefore, the cleaving of the pro -forms to \nactive cytokines forms . This finding above indicated that Per -OL might exert the anti -inflammatory \neffects in pristane -induced SLE via inhibiting canonical and non -canonical inflammasome \npathways.  Chapter V  \n178 \n In conclusion , this study showed, for the first time, the immunomodulatory effects of \ndietary OL and Per -OL supplementation in pristane -induced SLE in mice by inhibiting pro -\ninflammatory biomarkers such as cytokines production IL -1\u03b2, and IL -18, MMP -3, PGE 2, as well as \niNOS and mPGEs -1 over expression. The mechanisms underlying these protective effects could be \nrelated to the activation of the Nrf2/HO -1 antioxidant pathway as well as and the inhibition of \nrelevant s ignaling pathways including JAK/ STAT, MAPKs and NF-\u03baB. \nIn addition, the new synthetic  acetyl -derivatives exhibited a better anti -inflammatory \nprofile that the original compound OL inhibits the canonical and non -canonical NLRP3 \ninflammasome signaling pathways. Consequently, the acetyl ation may improve \npharmacody namics and pharmacokinetics profiles compared to the natural compound. Both OL \nand Per -OL may offer a new promising dietary strategy for the prevention and management of \nSLE, which needs to be further explored . \n \nReferences  \n\uf0b7 Adamik, J. et al.

Macrophages are major \ninflammatory and immune effector cells, with a crucial role in the pathogenesis and development of \ninflammatory chronic diseases, including SLE and RA. The exposition to bacterial lipopolysaccharide \n(LPS) drives the macrophages to an activated state that produces and balance disruption of the \nintracellular reduction -oxidation state accompanied by reactiv e oxygen species ( ROS )-mediated \ndamage and evokes the production of different inflammatory mediators. For this reason, the \nstimulation of macrophages with LPS constitutes a validate model for the screening and subsequent \nevaluation of the effects of candid ate drugs on the inflammatory pathway (Br\u00fcne et al. , 2013; S\u00e1nchez -\nMiranda et al. , 2013; Cardeno, Sanchez -Hidalgo, Aparicio -Soto, Sanchez -Fidalgo, et al. , 2014) . \nThe results of the present study showed, for the first time, that three new acetylated  OL \nderivatives exhibited s ignificant anti -inflammatory activities and attenuated the oxidative events \ninduced by LPS in murine peritoneal macrophages, exhibiting better results than the observed with \noriginal compound OL. Among them, Peracetylated OL (Per-OL) displayed the most effective anti -\ninflammatory behavior.  \nBalance disruption of the intracellular reduction -oxidation state has been observed in stimulated \nmacrophages, which leads to oxidative stress characterized by a major shift in the cellular redox \nbalance and usually ac companied by ROS -mediated damage. In fact, the new secoiridoid ac etylated \nderivatives were able to reduce ROS levels acting as effective anti -oxidants.  Thus, modulators  of ROS \nproduction and ROS -induced signalling pathways, especially in macrophages, could  represent \npotential strategies for anti -inflammatory intervention. Our findings are in concordance with other \nstudies in which OL showed a strong antioxidant effects in a similar range tested in our study (50 -100 \n\u00b5M). Also, other olive polyphenols like hy droxytyrosol (HTy) showed  important antioxidant effects \nacting as free radicals scavengers (Granados -Principal et al. , 2011)  [Chapter I. Figure 2].   \nA good balance of cell permeability and aqueous solubility, for optimal gastrointestinal \nabsor ption of a drug, has been suggested to be in the range of 0 <logP< 3.  Therefore, OL and its three \nacetylated  derivatives fulfil this requirement, although for Per-OL with the acetylated glucose moiety \nshould have better cell permeability, in accordance wi th the excellent results observed in in vitro  \nassays (Kerns and Di, 2008) . \nParticularly, stimulation of macrophages by LPS induces trans cription of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX -\n2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) genes and generation of large amounts of nitric oxide General discussion  \n \n186 \n (NO) that acts as an intracellular messenger, modulating the formation of endogenous ROS t hat \norchestrate the inflammatory response (Li et al. , 2012) . COX -2 , the inducible isoform of COX is \nessential for the inflammatory response and is responsible for the overproduction of  prostaglandin E 2 \n(PGE 2) in inflammation (Cardeno, Sanchez -Hidalgo, Aparicio -Soto, Sanchez -Fidalgo, et al. , 2014) . \nLikewise, PGE 2 modulates a variety of  immune processes at sites of inflammation, including \nproduction of pro -inflammatory cytokines (Imig, Breyer and Breyer, 2002) . In the present study nitric \noxide ( NO) levels and iNOS expression were decreased by OL treatment.  Similar data were reported \nby  Ryu et al., 2015 in RAW 264.7 cells (Ryu et al. , 2015) . Moreover, compounds (2), (3) and (4) at 25 \nand 50 \u00b5M produced a stronger reduct ion of both NO levels and iNOS protein expression when \ncompared to OL. Besides,  LPS stimulus upregulated COX -2 protein expression and increased PGE 2 \nlevels in murine peritoneal macrophages in concordance with  previous studies by Ap aricio -Soto et \nal., 2014  (Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2014)  [Chapter I. Figure 3 ]. \nLPS-stimulated macrophages are closely related to an imbalance of cytokine network. It is well \nknown that this kind of inflammatory process is characterized by an increase of helper T cells ( Th)-1 \nand Th17 proinflammatory  cytokines mainly, tumor necrosis factor ( TNF )-\u03b1, IL -1\u03b2, IL -6, IL-17 and \ninterferon ( IFN)-\u03b3. Our results showed that  OL and its derivatives inhibited the overproduction of \nthese proinflammtory  cytokines.   In fact, the treatment with OL significantly reduce d both IL -6 and \nIL-1\u03b2 cytokines in culture medium in agreement with a previous study (Ryu et al. , 2015) . However, \nTNF -\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL -17 levels  were not decreased after OL treatment. On the contrary, IL-6, IL -1\u03b2 , \nIFN-\u03b3  and IL -17 levels were diminished by OL derivative ( 3), compound (4) could decrease IL -6, IL -\n1\u03b2 , TNF -\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 levels and  finally, the derivative (2) significantly reduced the production of all \ntested  Th1 and Th17 pro -inflammatory cytokines show ing the best anti -inflammatory profile at the \nassayed concentrations (25 and 50 \u00b5M) in a dose -dependent manner [Chapter I. Figure 4].  \n In attempt to elucidate the action mechanisms of these phenolic compounds, we next studied the \ninvolvement of mitogen -activated protein kinases ( MAPK s), Janus kinase signal -transducer and \nactivator of transcription ( JAK/STAT ) and nuclear factor E2 -related factor 2 ( Nrf2 )/ heme oxygenase -\n1 (HO-1) signa ling pathways. MAPKs pathway is a critical axis essential for both inductio n and \npropagation of the inflammatory LPS -activated macrophage response (Radnai et al. , 2009) . MAPKs \ninclude extracellular signal -regulated (ERK 1/2), c-Jun N H2-terminal ( JNK) and p38 MAPKs . The \nincrease activity of MAPKs as well as their involvement in the regulation of the inflammation \nmediator synthesis at the transcription level and translation make them potential targets for anti -\ninflammatory therapy (Cardeno, Sanchez -Hidalgo, Aparicio -Soto and Alarcon -de-la-Lastra, 2014) . In \neffect, MAPKs have been show n to play crucial roles in iNOS  and COX -2 upregulation induced by \nvarious stimuli in mammalian cells (Guha and Mackman, 2001) . Our study showed that LPS evoked a \nsignificant in crement of the p38, JNK and ERK 1/2 MAPKs phosphorylation  in peritoneal macrophages \nafter 18 h of stimulation. In contrast, O L treatment and  its acetylated  derivatives (25 and 50 \u00b5M) \nreduced MAPKs phosphorylation, which was consistent with previous studies reporting that OL \ninhibited MAPKs activation in RAW 264.7 cells (Ryu et al. , 2015)  and in human osteoarthritis \nchondrocytes (Feng et al. , 2017)  [Chapter I. Figure 5] .   General discussion  \n \n187 \n Moreover, MAPKs are also involved in the activation of JAK/STAT,  an important signalling \ntransduction  pathway  for the biological function of many cytokines.  Our results are in agreement \nwith previous studies reporting that OL treatment attenuated th e induced activation of signal \ntransducer and activator of transcription ( STAT )-3 in a murine colitis -associated  colorectal cancer \nmodel (Giner et al. , 2016) . Besides, (2) and (3) OL derivatives also exhibited significant effects in the \nprevention of the induced phosphorylation of STAT -3, showing better results that the described after \nthe treatment with the parent. Altogether, our data suggest that all tested compounds present a \npotential anti -inflammatory effect mediated in part by STAT -3 inactivation  [Chapter I. Figure 6A] . \nNrf2, is a redox -sensitive transcription factor and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) \nlocated in the promoter regions of many detoxifying/antioxidan t genes, including HO -1 (Bang et al. , \n2012) . In the presence of oxidative stress, Nrf2 could migrate to the nucleus, bind to the oxidant \nresponse element sequence, and induce phase II gene transcription resulting in a cytoprotective  \nresponse characterized by up regulation of HO -1 among others, and decreased sensitivity to oxidative \nstress damage. In inflammatory conditions, HO -1 expression protein could be part of an adaptive \nmechanism to limit cytotoxicity via several mechanisms inc luding scavenging of ROS and nitrogen \nspecies, regulation of cell proliferation and prevention of apoptosis.  Our results in concordance with \nAparicio -Soto et al., 2015 (Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2015) , showed that LPS stimulation decreased Nrf2 and \nHO-1 expression. On the contrary, OL derivatives treatments (25 and 50 \u00b5M) were able to increase \nthese redu ced expressions of Nrf2 and HO -1 induced by LPS, but we did not observed any significant \nchanges in the expression of HO -1 and Nrf2 after the treatment with the original compound. \nAltogether, our data suggest that ac etylated OL derivatives present also a p otential antioxidant effect \nwhich is mediated by Nrf2/HO -1 antioxidant signa ling pathway  [Chapter I. Figure 6B] . \nIn conclusion, this study showed, for the first time, the new ac etylated OL derivatives: Per-OL, \n2\u2019\u2019, 3\u2019\u2019, 4\u2019\u2019, 6\u2019\u2019 -Tetra -O-acetyloleuropein and 6\u2019\u2019-O-Acetyloleuropein have an important role in the \nbalance of the inflammatory microenvironment  induced by LPS in murine peritoneal macrophages by \ninhibiting pro -inflammatory cytokines production, such as IL -1\u03b2, TNF -\u03b1, IL -6, IL -17 and IFN -\u03b3, as \nwell as iNOS and COX -2 overexpression . The mechanisms underlying these protective effects could \nbe related via the Nrf2/HO -1 antioxidant pathway activa tion and inhibition of both JAK/ STAT and \nMAPKS signalling pathways. Furthermore, these new synthetic OL deriva tives exhibit a better anti -\ninflammatory profile that the natural compound OL, that could be due to their better \npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics profiles related to the modification of their chemical structure .  \nThereby, these new OL derivatives may offer a new promising therapeutic strategy in the \nmanagement of inflammatory related pathologies, which needs to be further investigated. It could be \na useful option to increase the quality of life of patients with the se types of diseases, probably as a \ndietary supplement.  \nIn the chapter II , we investigated the potential effects of OL i n IL -1\u03b2-stimulated SW982 cells \n(human RA - synovial fibroblasts ( SFs) cell line). RA pathology is characterized by chronic synovitis in \npoly -articular joints.  In RA joints, there are hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the synovial lining cells, \nspecifically, SFs. In fact, SFs act as a major cell population in the invasive pannus to participate in the \nchronic inflammatory responses (Firestein, 1996) . SFs contribute significantly to matrix degradation in General discussion  \n \n188 \n RA through the production of inflammator y medi ators such as cytokines mainly TNF -\u03b1 and IL -6 \nsustaining regulatory feedback loop s that induce the production of enzymes, such as, \nmetalloproteinases ( MMPs )  through the activation of cellular sign aling pathways involving MAPKs  \n(McInnes and Schett, 2007; Su et al. , 2016) . TNF -\u03b1 is reportedly involved in early joint swelli ng, \nchronic joint inflammation and the concomitant erosive changes in cartilage and bone (Sommerfelt et \nal., 2013) . On the other hand, IL -6 is a key cytokine inducing a decrease in type II collagen (CII) \nproduction, increase in MMPs synthesis, and changes in the subchondral bone layer  (Chenoufi et al. , \n2001) . High levels of IL -6 have been detected in both sera and synovial fluids from the affected joints \nof RA patients. In this study, we have demonstrated that treatment with OL caused a significant \ninhibition of IL -1\u03b2-induced TNF -\u03b1 and IL -6 release in human synovial SW982 cells  [Chapter II. Figure \n3]. \nAmong MMPs, MMP -1 (colagenase 1) and MMP -3 (stromelysin)  have been reported to be the \nmajor enzymes produced by fibroblasts and macrophage -like cells in the synovium, and their levels \nare significantly higher in synovial fluids from patients with RA (Rosillo et al. , 2016) .  MMP -1 is one of \nthe critical neutr al proteinases which degrade native fibrillary collagens in the extracellular matrix  \n(Yamanishi and Firestein, 2001) . On the other hand, MMP -3 is responsible to degrade proteoglycan, \ntype IV and type IX collagens and denatured type I and type II collagens,  fibronectin, gelatin and \nlaminin  and is believed to be especially important because, besides of its direct enzyme activity, its \nactivation is necessary for full activation of collagenases (Chen and Mattey, 2012) .  Our data showe d \nthat the production of both MMP -1 and MMP -3 was significantly induced by IL -1\u03b2 stimulation in \nhuman SW982 cells, whereas pre -treatment with OL induced a significant down -regulation of both \nMMPs levels in IL -1\u03b2-stimulated SW982 cells  [Chapter II. Figure 4 ].  \nCOX -2, the inducible isoform of COX,  and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase - 1 (mPGEs -1), \nenzymes responsible for the overproduction of PGE 2 in inflammation, are up -regulated  contributing \nto the progression of RA through prostaglandin E 2 receptor 4 (EP4) activation  (McCoy, Wicks and \nAudoly, 2002) . We have shown that OL  decreased expression  of both COX -2 and mPGEs -1 in IL -1\u03b2-\nstimulated SW982 cells  [Chapter II. Figure 5 ]. \nNuclear transcription factor kappa -B (NF-\u03baB) has been implicated in cytokine release, activation, \nautoantibody production, cellular proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and numerous other processes \nassociated with RA. Also plays a pivotal role in the development and activation of T h-1 responses and \nis responsible in addition to MAPKs for COX -2 up -regulation  (Makarov, 2001) . NF -\u03baB, as a dimeric \ntranscription factor exists in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex with the inhibitory protein IkB -\u03b1. \nAn inflamma tory signal such as IL -1\u03b2 induced the activation of I\u03baB -\u03b1 kinase complex to \nphosphorylate members of the IkB family. Phosphorylated IkB becomes ubiquitinated and is then \ntargeted for degradation by the proteasome. The NF -\u03baB dimmers can then translocate to the nucleus \nand activate the transcription and repression of genes (Hayden and Ghosh, 2008; Scheinman, 2013) .   \nOn other hand, MAPKs have previously been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of the \nsynthesis of chemokines, cytokines, adhesion molecules and prostaglandin ( PG)s involved in RA and \nare considered as the major tyrosine phosphorylation proteins in human synov ial stimulated with IL -  General discussion  \n \n189 \n 1\u03b2 (Barchowsky, Frleta and Vincenti, 2000) . Besides JNK MAPK modula tes MMPs production by \nsynovial fibroblasts and drives osteoclast differentiation in RA (Han et al. , 2001) . In particular, p38 \nMAPK regulates MMP -3 induction in fibroblasts and osteoclast differentiation  (Rosillo et al. , 2015) . \nAccumulating studies have demonstrated that inhibitors of MAPKs and NF -\u03baB alleviated synovial \ninflammation, bone destruction, and cartilage damage in animal models of arthritis, including \nadjuvant arthritis in rats and CIA in mice  (Han et al. , 2001; Nishikawa et al. , 2003) .  \nAs expected, the exposure of IL -1\u03b2 significantly inc reased the degradation of I \u03baB\u03b1 and \nphosphorylation of ERK 1/2, JNK and p38, indicating NF -\u03baB and MAPKs activation in SW982 cells \nwhich was consistent with previous studies reported by Schett et al., and Inoue et al., (Schett et al. , \n2000; Inoue et al. , 2001) . However, pre -treatment with OL, at concentration of 50 and 100 \u03bcM strongly \ninhibited the I \u03baB-\u03b1 degradation a nd prevented the activation of MAPKs.  These results indicate that \nOL inhibit inflammation in IL -1\u03b2-treated SW982 cells by regulating the NF -\u03baB and MAPKs pathways \n[Chapter II. Figure 6 and 7 ]. \nIn basal conditions, Nrf2 in sequestered in the cytoplasma by K elch-likeECH -associated protein 1 \n(Keap1) and degraded by the ubiquitin -dependent 26S proteasome system. In inflammatory and \nimmune conditions, the expression of this protein could be part of an adaptive  mechanism to limit \ncytotoxicity via several mechanisms including scavenging of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, \nregulation of cell proliferation and prevention of apoptosis  (Rosillo et al. , 2016) . Furthermore, the \ndeficiency of HO -1 in both mice an d humans induces the characteristic phenotype of an increased \ninflammatory state, whereas the induction of HO -1 in animals leads to the protection of the \nprogression of arthritis with decreased levels of matrix MMPs and the prevention of cartilage \ndegradat ion suggesting the HO -1 plays the key role in RA therapeutic strategy (Su et al. , 2016) .  \nOur data showed that OL treatment strongly augmented Nrf2 and HO -1 expression conferring a \nrole of HO -1 in the beneficial effects of OL in IL -1\u03b2-stimulated SW982 cells.  Thus HO -1 could \nrepresent a potential molecular target  susceptible to modulation with treatment with OL, which has \nnot been demonstrated previously  [Chapter II. Figure 8 ]. \nIn conclusion, our study has  demonstrated, for the first time, that OL prevented the inflammatory \nresponse and oxidative stress of IL -1\u03b2 -induced SW982 human synovial cells.  The mechanisms \nunderlying these protective effects could be related   via down -regulation of MAPKs and NF -\u03baB and \ninduction of Nrf2 -linked HO -1 signa ling pathways controlling the production of pro -inflammatory \ncytokines, MMP -1 and MMP -3 levels as well as mPGES -1 and COX -2 overexpression. Thus, OL might \nprovide a basis for developing a new dietary strategy for the prevention and management of RA.  \nThe aim o f the chapter III  has been to demonstrate the potential protective role of a diet \nelaborated with OL and Per -OL in the prevention and development of inflammatory arthritis and \njoint damage in a collagen induce arthritis (CIA) murine model . This model is co mmonly used to \ninvestigate mechanisms relevant to RA as well as new antiarthritic  treatments (Ferrandiz et al. , 2007) . \nCIA induction resulted in the development of a remarkable synovitis associated with an autoimmune \nresponse against cartilage and production of matrix degrading enzymes accompanying cartilage \ndegradation and bone erosion (Schurgers, Billiau and Matthys, 2011) .  General discussion  \n \n190 \n Our results indicate that OL and Per -OL dietary treatments exhibited preventive and therapeutic \neffects in the development of inflammatory arthritis and joint d amage in CIA arthritic mice  (SD-CIA)  \nin comparison with CIA mice fed with standard diet (SD) [Chapter III. Figure 1 A and 1B ]. These \neffects were correlated to an improved arthritis score, a minor inflammatory cells infiltration into \narticular tissues, redu ced exudation into the synovial space, synovial hyperplasia and cartilage \nerosion [Chapter II I. Figure 1C ]. \nThe pathogenesis of RA is related to an imbalance of cytokine network contributing to the \ndevelopment and progression of both CIA and RA (Komatsu and Takayanagi, 2012) . In RA synovium, \nelevated levels of pr o-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF -\u03b1, IL -1\u03b2, IL -6, IL -17 and IFN -\u03b3 are \nproduced by macrophages and synovial fibroblasts. Our results indicate that mice fed with OL and \nPer-OL enriched -diets showed a significant reduction in all -pro-inflammatory cytokines  levels in \ncomparison with SD -CIA control group  [Chapter II I. Figure 3 ]. \nAlso, COX -2 and iNOS mRNA expression levels are up -regulated in LPS -stimulated RAW 264.7 \ncells and consequently, contributing to the progression of RA (Zhao et al. , 2019) . We have shown that \nOL and Per -OL dietary treatments reduce COX -2 expression in the knee joint, and also these results \nshowed a significant decreased of iNOS protein expression in paw homogenates in mice which were \nfed with Per -OL enri ched -diet at both do ses assayed [Chapter III. Figure 4 ]. \nMMP3 (stromelysin) have been reported to be the major enzymes produced by fibroblasts and \nmacrophage cells in the synovium, and is responsible for the degradation of proteoglycan, various \ntype of collagens and denatured  type I and type II collagens, among others, besides of its direct \nenzyme activity its activation is necessary for full activation of collagenases (Castej\u00f3n et al. , 2017) . \nCollagen oligomeric matrix protein ( COMP ), a prominent non -collagenous component of cartilage \nshows great potential as a biological marker of cartilage metabolism in arthritis (Rosillo et al. , 2015 ). It \nhas been reported to increase in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and early RA. It has been \nproposed that COMP molecules are important for maintaining the properties and integrity of the \ncollagen network and contribute to the material proper ties of biological tissue (Haikal et al. , 2019) . Our \ndata showed that the production of both MMP -3 and COMP was significantly increased in SD -CIA \ncontrol group;  whereas OL and Per -OL dietary treatment induced a significant down -regulation of \nboth serum parameters levels  [Chapter II I. Figure 2 ]. \nMAPKs also play important roles in transducing synovial inflammation and joint destruction and \nthey are considered critical molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in RA (Thalhamer, McGrath \nand Harnett, 2007) . MAPK JNK and ERK 1/2 play a major role in modulating collagenase production \nand invasion by RA fi broblasts, while p38 MAPK isoforms are involved in regulating many of cellular \nbiological processes, concretely synovial inflammatory cytokine production, which participate to the \npathogenesis of RA (Zou et al. , 2017) . ERK 1/2 also participat es in promoting pannus formation \n(Goodridge et al. , 2003) . Our data indicate that OL and Per -OL dietary treatments were able to reduce \nthe phosphorylati on of JNK, p38 and ERK 1/2, suggesting that these experimental diets could control \nthe activation of these signa ling pathways during arthritic inflammatory process  [Chapter III. Figure \n6].   General discussion  \n \n191 \n NF-\u03baB is considered a key signa ling molecule in the control of synovial inflammation, \nhyperplasia and matrix generation (Zou et al. , 2017) . It is a mechanism involucrate in RA because at \ninflammatory cytokines are produced by immune -activated cells and exert various actions o n \ninflammation through the activation of the NF -\u03baB signal ing pathway (Aupperle et al. , 2001) . Our data \nare in agreement with C astej\u00f3n et al., that showed that OL and Per -OL dietary treatments increased \nthe inhibitory protein I\u03baB -\u03b1 and reduced NF -\u03baB-p65 and p50 translocation, indicating that these \ndietary treatments inhibited the NF -\u03baB activation by blocking I\u03baB -\u03b1 degradation in p ristane induced \nsystemic lupus erythematosus in mice  (Castejon et al. , 2019)  [Chapter III. Figure 5 ]. \nIt was reported that activation of Nrf2/HO -1 signa ling pathway plays a critical role in the \nprevention and relief of RA (Fan et al. , 2018) . Induction of HO -1 expression protects against cartilage \ndestruction and  decreases the secretion of pro inflammatory cytokines in CIA model (Li et al. , 2014) . \nNrf2 plays an important role for expression of HO -1. Nrf2 inhibition aggravates cartilage destruction \nand accelerates the effector phase of RA in mice. However, upregulating the expression of Nrf2 exerts \nanti-inflammatory effects in RA (W.-J. Wu et al. , 2016) . In the present study, we have demonstrated \nthat Nrf2 and HO -1 prot ein expression were decreased in SD -CIA control group;  however dietary \nPer-OL treatments at both doses assayed could restore Nrf2 and HO -1 expressions conferring a role of \nNrf2/HO -1 signa ling pathway in the beneficial effects of Per -OL enr iched -diets in CI A model of RA \n[Chapter III. Figure 7 ]. \nIn conclusion, this study showed, for the first time, the beneficial effects of dietary OL and Per -OL \nsupplementation in CIA model of RA by inhibiting pro -inflammatory biomarkers such as cytokines \nproduction (IL -6, IL -1\u03b2, TNF -\u03b1, IFN -\u03b3, IL -17) in paw homoge nates and  MMP3 and COMP serum \nlevels, as well as, iNOS and COX -2 over expression. The mechanisms underlying these protective \neffects could be related to the activation of Nrf2/HO -1 antioxidant pathway as well as the inhibition \nof important signalling  path ways including MAPKs and NF -\u03baB. Both OL and Per -OL may offer a new \npromising dietary strategy for the prevention and management of RA, which needs to be further \nexplored . \nIn chapter IV , we have dept insight into t he effects of OL and its new lipophilic acetyl-derivative \nPer-OL dietary treatments on murine peritoneal macrophages from pristane -SLE mice, evaluating the \nclinical, pathological, and mechanistic contribution.  \nSLE is as autoimmune disease, characterized by autoantibody generation, immune complexes, \nautoreactive or inflammatory T cells and inflammatory cytokines that may initiate and amplify \ninflammation and damage to various organs  such as kidney contributing t o the clinical \nmanifestations of SLE (Aparicio -Soto, S\u00e1nchez -Hidalgo and Alarc\u00f3n -de-la-Lastra, 2017; Xu and Li,  \n2018) .  \nPatients with  SLE  show an impaired oxidative status and increased levels of IL -1\u03b2, TNF, IL -17 \nand IL -18, which are closely linked to inflammation and correlated with disease activity (C.-Y. Wu et \nal., 2016) . It has been reported that IL -1\u03b2 can promote the proliferation,  migration, and invasion of \nother cells via activating STAT3. Besides, STAT3 signa ling plays a crucial role in the Th17 generation \nand an upregulated STAT3/IL -17 expression had been described in lupus patients (Chen et al. , 2019) . General discussion  \n \n192 \n In the present study, we found that OL and Per -OL dietary treatments reduced the inflammatory \ninfiltrated in kidneys  [Chapter IV. Figure 2].  Anti -inflammatory response was accompanied by a \nsignificant reduction of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines levels as well as p -STAT3 downregula tion in \nLPS-stimulated macrophages from OL and Per -OL treated SLE mice  [Chapter IV. Figure 3 and 6 ]. \nRecently, it has been described that acute consumption of olive oil decreased the activation of NF -\n\u03baB system on mononuclear cells from healthy donors and that OL inhibits LPS -triggered NF -\u03baB and \nactivator protein (AP) -1 activation. NF -\u03baB induce s the expression of various pro inflammatory genes, \nincluding those encoding cytokines and chemokines such as TNF -\u03b1, IL -1\u03b2, IL -6, iNOS and COX -2, \namong others, and also participates in the regulation and assembly of inflammasome complex \ncontributing to the initiation and development of inflammatory diseases (Liu et al. , 2017) .  \nBy inhibiting the activation of NF -\u03baB, the producti on of inflammatory mediators under its control \nmay be reduced. Our results have demonstrated that experimental diets with OL and Per -OL were \nable to reduce the I\u03baB -\u03b1 translocation into nucleus and controlling the NF -\u03baB activation [Chapter IV. \nFigure 5 ]. In this regard, Miles et  al. demonstrated that OL significantly decreased the concentration \nof IL -1\u03b2 in LPS -stimulated human whole blood culture (Carluccio et al. , 2003; Miles, Zoubouli and \nCalder, 2005; Perez -Martinez et al. , 2007) . Similar results were described in human synovial fibroblast \ncell line SW982 where OL as well as the phenolic fraction from EVOO exerted anti -inflammatory and \nanti-oxidant effects via down -regulation of MAPK and NF -\u03baB signa ling pathways and induction of \nNrf2 -linked HO-1 controlling the production of inflammatory mediators such as IL -6 and TNF -\u03b1 \ncytokines, MMP -1 an d MMP -3 levels an d mPGEs -1 and COX -2 overexpression (Castejon et al. , 2017; \nRosillo et al. , 2019) .  \nThe inflammasome was described as a large intracellular signa ling complex that contains a \ncytosolic pattern recognition receptor, especially a NLRP. Among NLR inflammasome complex, the \nmost characterized is NLR family pyr in domain -containing 3 inflammasome (NLRP3 ) (Jo et al. , 2016) . \nInflammasome machinery is dy sregulated in SLE and plays an important role in promotion of organ \ndamage. Maturation and secretion of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 translation are mediated by inflamm asome \nactivated caspase -1 (Shirato et al. , 2017) . Canonical inf lammasome induce inflammatory response by \nprocessing inactive procaspase -1 into cleaved caspase -1. Caspase 1 is able to regulate the maturation  \nof IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 into active cytokines which are involved in the lupus injury  (Jo et al. , 2016) . Besides, \nnon-canonical inflammasome, there is an alternative via which has been described t o activate caspase -\n11, and also serve as an additional pathway of maturation  and secretion of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 in \nmacrophage -mediate immune response (Kayagaki et al. , 2011) . \n We found, for the first time that OL and Per -OL dietary treatments inhibited canonical and non -\ncanonical activation of NLRP3 inflammasome/IL -1\u03b2 in murine peritoneal macrophages isolated from \npristane -SLE mice.  This important finding indicates that OL and Per -OL inhibited disease \nprogressi on which was at least partly dependent on inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasomes  [Chapter IV. \nFigure 7 ]. Similar data were found after HT y and Peracetylated -HTy ( Per-HTy ) treatments on LPS - \ninduced inflammatory response in murine peritoneal macrophages (Montoy a et al. , 2018) .    General discussion  \n \n193 \n Taken together, OL and Per -OL exerted a protective effect against inflammatory lupic response in \nmurine peritoneal macrophages from pristane -SLE mice via STAT3 and NF -\u03baB signa ling expression \ncoupled with inhibition of canonical and non -canonical NLRP3 inflammasome.  \nFinally, in the chapter V, we have demonstrated that OL and Per -OL supplemented diets could \nmodulate SLE on pristane -induced model in mice, specifically preventing re nal injury through \nmodulating NF-\u03baB, STAT3 and MAPKs signa ling pathways, and inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome \ncomplex.  \nPristane -treated mice presented some degree of renal abnormalities in comparison with control \nmice, ranging from abundant inflammatory mononuclear cells in the renal interstitium to renal \ninter stitial fibrosis.  On the cont rary, kidneys  from   pristane -treated mice fed  with OL and PER -OL \nshowed  a significant improvement of the  renal cytoarchitecture, The appearance of hyaline -like renal \ntubule areas after pristane treatment and, preferably, after administration of oil diets, has not been \npreviously referenced in the literature, excepting by Ruan et al. (Ruan et al. , 2016)  that described the \npresence of a large lightly stained mucous -like substance. The hist ological aspects of renal tissue in \nour studies were very similar to those described by Ruan et al. but being them periodic acid Shiff \n(PAS ) negative, their mucous nature is questionable (Ruan et al. , 2016)  [Chapter V. Figure 1].   \nMMP -3 (stromelysin -1) levels were markedly elevated in SLE. with a possible role in the \npathogenesis of lupus nephritis (Gheita et al. , 2015) . Accor dingly with  our previous findings \n(Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2016, 2017) . MMP -3 serum levels were increased in SD -SLE mice which, however \nserum MMP -3 levels were significantly reduced in those pristane -treated mice that received OL and \nPer-OL enriched -diets contributing to minimize  pristane -induced renal damage [Chapter V.  Figure 2 ].  \nPGE 2 is a bioactive lipid mediator biosynthesized by mPGEs -1 (Schneider, Boeglin and Brash, \n2004) , which   plays a crucial role in the development of  inflammatory response, acting as a mediator \nof  Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines  and it has been implicated in the glomerular filtration regulation (Imig, \nBreyer and Breyer, 2002; Adamik et al. , 2013) . Besides, PGE 2 high urinary levels of this prostanoid \nhave been reported in lupus nephritis (Herrera -Marcos et al. , 2017) . In  previous studies by our \nresearch  group  (Aparicio -Soto et al. , 2016, 2017)  high levels of PGE 2 and mPGEs -1 protein ex pression \nwere found in pristane -induced SLE  mice. However, both parameters were significant reduced in \nrenal tissue of pristane -induced animals that were received OL and Per -OL supplemented diet in \ncomparison with those animals which were fed with SD . NO is overproduced in the setting of lupus \nactivity (Oates and Gilkeson, 2006) . NO works as  an intracellular messenger which  regulates the \nformation of  ROS and RNS synchronizing the inflammatory response (Montoya et al. , 2018) . Our \nresults showed, accordingly with previous studies (Jiang et al. , 2014)  that iNOS expression was \nremarkably increased in  kidneys from SD -SLE mice, however experiment al diets enriched with OL \nand Per -OL could restore reduced iNOs expression  [Chapter V.  Figure 3 ]. \nNrf2 signa ling pathway is a crucial regulator of the antioxidant response  in mammalian cells in \nresponse to endogenous and exogenous stress (Yu et al. , 2014)  modulating the transcription of \nantioxidant genes, in cluding HO -1. Previous studies have demonstrated that Nrf2 improves lupus \nnephritis in a pristane - induced SLE model by neutralizing reactive oxygen species and by negatively General discussion  \n \n194 \n regulating the NF -\u03baB in patients with SLE. In addition, a significant decrease in  HO-1 expression \n(Jiang et al. , 2014) , specifically in monocytes (Herrada et al. , 2012)  has been found, thus HO -1 induction  \ncould ameliorate  lupus nephritis, p robably by multiple mechanisms including NO synthesis \nsuppression, inhibition of antibody production and modulation of cytokine production (Takeda et al. , \n2004) .  In our studies, OL and Per -OL dietary treatments strongly could reestablish Nrf2 and HO -1 \nexpressions conferring a role of Nrf2/HO -1 signa ling in the beneficial effects of dietary OL and Per -\nOL in this SLE model  [Chapter V.  Figure 4 ].  \nNF-\u03baB is a redox sensitive transcription factor which controls the expression of several genes \ninvolved in inflammatory responses such as pro -inflammatory cytokines including TNF -\u03b1, IL-1, 6 and \nIL-17 and is crucial in self -reactive T - and B -lymphocyte, survival and proliferation in lupus \ndevelopment (Okamo to, 2006)  In this sense, lower I \u03baB-\u03b1 protein and high p65 expressions  has been \nobserved after pristane injection. However, kidneys from pristane mice fed with either OL or Per -OL \nshowed similar I \u03baB-\u03b1 than in SD -sham group. In accordance with these resu lts, p65 translocation was \nalso reduced in OL and Per -OL groups compared to pristane group mice  [Chapter V.  Figure 5B ].  \nThese results are in agreement with our previous findings where other olive oil polyphenols \nsupplemented diets increased I \u03baB-\u03b1 expression and reduced p65 nuclear translocation in pristane \nmodels of SLE.   \nMAPK family members (p38 kinases, ERK 1/2 and JNK ) are implicated in several cell processes \nsuch as regulation of the synthesis of  cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and P Gs involved in \nthe regulation of autoimmune response (Thalha mer, McGrath and Harnett, 2007) . Importantly, \nMAPKs phosphorylate the STAT3, important in pro -inflammatory cytokine -mediated signa ling \npathways leading to STAT3 activation by phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, resulting in the \nformation of STAT dimer s that translocate into the nucleus to bind specific DNA sequences (Wang, \nCherukuri and L uo, 2005) . Our findings show that STAT3 and MAPKs phosphorylation were \nincreased in kidneys from SLE pristane mice; however, dietary OL and Per -OL supplementation \nsignificantly reduce both STAT3 and MAPKs activation at transcriptional level. Altogether,  our results \nsuggest that dietary OL and Per -OL may ameliorate inflammatory biomarkers production interfering \nnegatively with JNK, p38, ERK MAPKs and STAT -3 signal ing pathways  [Chapter V.  Figure 5A and \n5C]. \nIn other hand, inflammasomes are multi -protein complexes associated with several immune, \ninflammatory and auto -inflammatory diseases which use a central support and adaptor molecules to \nrecruit and activate caspase -1 and caspase -11. Canonical inflammasomes  induce inflammatory \nresponse by processing inactive procaspase -1 into cleaved active caspase -1 (Montoya et al. , 2018) . \nThese canonical inflammasomes contain the nucleotide -binding oligomerization domain (NOD) -like \nreceptor (NLR), the adapter molecule ap optosis -associated speck -like protein that contains a CARD \n(ASC) and caspase -1 (Liu, Berthier and Kahlenberg, 2017) . Then, active caspase -1 cleaves the pro -\ninflammatory cytokines IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 to their actives forms which are known to contribute directly \nto the inflammatory injury in lupus.  Increased expression of NLRP3 and caspase -1, among others \ninflammasome components has been reported in lupus nephritis biopsies (Kahlenberg et al. , 2011) , \nsuggesting that this tissue  may be aware for inflammasome activation.  In our study, we observed that   General discussion  \n \n195 \n pristane -induced SLE significantly increased NLRP3, ASC and caspase 1 protein expression, leading \nto the release of IL -1\u03b2 and IL - 18, whereas only Per -OL supplemented diet could redu ce NLRP3 -ASC -\ninflammasome -activated caspase -1 cleavage inhibiting the canonical inflammasome pathway. \nChanges on immunosignals of active forms of caspase -1 (pro -caspase -1 and caspase -1) were not \nobserved aft er OL dietary treatment [Chapter V.  Figure 6A and  6B]. \nFor other hand, the non -canonical inflammasome, an alternative mechanism, has been described  \nto activate caspase -11 enzyme and  in turn  induce not only pyroptosis but also serves as an additional \npathway for maturation and secretion of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 in macrophage -mediated innate immune \nresponses (Kayagaki et al. , 2011) . Our data shown like pro -caspase -11 and caspase -11 activation was \ninduced by pristane. Nevertheless, Per -OL treatment could inhibit N LRP3 -inflammasome -activated \ncaspase -11 cleavage. Our results have demonstrated a decreasing of IL -1\u03b2 and IL -18 levels, probably \nas a consequence of NLRP3 down -regulation, highlighting the importance of the NLRPs regulation of \navoiding inflammasome activati on and therefore, the cleaving of the pro -forms to active cytokines \nforms . This finding above indicated that Per -OL might exert the anti -inflammatory effects in pristane -\ninduced SLE via inhibiting canonical and non -canonical inflammasome pathways [Chapter V. Figure \n6C]. \nIn conclusion , this study showed, for the first time, the immunomodulatory effects of dietary OL \nand Per -OL supplementation in pristane -induced SLE in mice by inhibiting pro -inflammatory \nbiomarkers such as cytokines production IL -1\u03b2, and IL -18, MMP -3, PGE 2, as well as iNOS and \nmPGEs -1 over expression. The mechanisms underlying these protective effects could be related to the \nactivation of the Nrf2/HO -1 antioxidant pathway as well as and the inhibition of relevant signalling  \npathways including  JAK/ STAT, MAPKs and NF-\u03baB. \nIn addition, the new synthetic  acetyl -derivatives exhibited a better anti -inflammatory profile that \nthe original compound OL inhibits the canonical and non -canonical NLRP3 inflammasome signa ling \npathways. Consequently, the acety lation may improve pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics \nprofiles compared to the natural compound. Both OL and Per -OL may offer a new promising dietary \nstrategy for the prevention and management of SLE , which needs to be further explored . \nAltogether, this Thesis provides preliminary evidence that OL exerts preventive/palliative effects \nin the development of experimental RA and SLE, and also its new acetyl derivative, Per -OL which \ndemonstrate its beneficial effects in these pathologies. Howe ver, the current challenge is to confirm \nthat all these in vitro and in vivo observed phenomena described in this Thesis, also occur in human \nafter OL and Per -OL consumption, and that results in a decreased risk of developing RA and SLE, or \nsuffering outbr eaks of these diseases  and its related symptoms , which requires future and further \nstudies.  \nNevertheless, OL and Per -OL may be considered as supportive nutritional therapy for patients of \nRA and SLE or OL and Per -OL supplement might provide an attractive nutraceutical complement in \nthe management of RA and SLE, owing to their notable effects without the side effects of classical \npharmacology, and their potential contribution to reducing comorbidities and improving quality of \nlife in patients with RA and SL E, thereby offering a new promising strategy in the nutritional therapy General discussion  \n \n196 \n of this immune -inflammatory disease, as well as a new fields of research which need to be pursued \nfurther.  \n \nReferences  \n\uf0b7 Adamik, J. et al.

La OL as\u00ed como sus derivados acetilados obtenidos semisint\u00e9ticamente demostraron marcadas \nactividades antioxidantes previniendo la formaci\u00f3n de especies reactivas de ox\u00edgeno y \nantiinflamatoria, disminuyendo la producci\u00f3n de nitritos, de citocinas inflamatorias, la expresi\u00f3n de \nlas prote\u00ed nas COX -2 e iNOS, as\u00ed como los nivele s de PGE 2 en macr\u00f3fagos peritoneales murinos \nestimulados con LPS. Adem\u00e1s, tanto  OL como sus derivados, redujeron la fosforilaci\u00f3n d e las MAP \ncinasas y la v\u00eda JAK/ STAT y adem\u00e1s incrementaron la expresi\u00f3n de la v\u00eda antioxidante Nrf2/HO -1. \nEstos resultados p onen de manifiesto la capacidad moduladora de la respuesta inmune e inflamatoria \nde este compuesto obtenido de las hojas del olivo, as\u00ed como de los derivados obtenidos a partir del \ncompuesto natural, l o que podr\u00eda ser de inter\u00e9s para el abordaje terap\u00e9utic o de enfermedades de \ncar\u00e1cter inmunoinflamatoria.  \n \n2. Tras el tratamiento con OL en FS humanos (SW982) estimulados con IL -1\u03b2, pusimos de manifiesto       \nuna disminuci\u00f3n significativa en la producci\u00f3n de niveles de las citoquinas pro -inflamatorias IL -6 y \nTNF -\u03b1, de las proteasas MMP -1 y MMP -3, y una inhibici\u00f3n de la expresi\u00f3n proteica de la enzima pro -\ninflamatoria COX -2, posiblemente asociados a una disminuci\u00f3n en la activaci\u00f3n de la v\u00eda de las MAP \nquinasas y una prevenci\u00f3n en la degradaci\u00f3n de la prote\u00edna inh ibitoria I\u03baB -\u03b1, as\u00ed como un incremento \nen la expresi\u00f3n de la v\u00eda antioxidante regulada por Nrf2 y HO -1. Estos resultados preliminares \nsugieren que la OL podr\u00eda participar en el desarrollo de una nueva estrategia terap\u00e9utica dirigida a \nlos elementos del sis tema inmunitario cuyas limitaciones en eficacia y/o seguridad son bien conocidas \ny constituir un complemento nutricional de gran valor en el tratamiento y/o prevenci\u00f3n de la AR al \nactuar sobre procesos FS -dependientes.  \n \n3. Las dietas enriquecidas con OL y su derivado peracetilado, Per -OL, redujeron significativamente la \nincidencia y gravedad del da\u00f1o articular en el modelo de artritis inducida por col\u00e1geno II en ratones \nDBA 1/J en comparaci\u00f3n con aquellos alimentados con una  dieta est\u00e1ndar. Se apreci\u00f3 una reducci\u00f3n \ndel n\u00famero y severidad de articulaciones afectadas y un menos \u00edndice cl\u00ednico de la enfermedad desde \nlos d\u00edas 30 hasta 42.  \n \n4. Tras el tratamiento con las dietas enriquecidas con OL y Per -OL en ratones con artritis, se  observ\u00f3 una \natenuaci\u00f3n de las alteraciones histomorfol\u00f3gicas asociadas a la lesi\u00f3n articular. La respuesta \ninflamatoria articular con las dietas experimentales se relaci\u00f3n con una disminuci\u00f3n significativa en \nlos niveles de citoquinas pro -inflamatorias y de los marcadores ser\u00f3logicos de inflamaci\u00f3n sinovial y \ndegradaci\u00f3n del cart\u00edlago MMP -3 y COMP, respectivamente. Dichos efectos estuvieron asociados a la \ninhibici\u00f3n de las v\u00edas de se\u00f1a lizaci\u00f3n molecular de las MAP c inasas y al factor de transcripci\u00f3n NF-\u03baB \nmodulando la expresi\u00f3n de marcadores pro -inflamatorios COX2 e iNOS, as\u00ed como a la activaci\u00f3n de la \nv\u00eda antioxidante Nrf2/HO -1, ru tas que parecen estar funcional mente interconectadas. Por todo ello, \neste tipo de suplementaci\u00f3n diet\u00e9tica podr\u00eda ser consider ado como una alternativa en la terapia \nnutricional de pacientes con AR.  \n   Conclusiones  \n203 \n 5. En macr\u00f3fagos peritoneales procedentes de ratones con LES inducido por pristano, dietas \nexperimentales enriquecidas con OL y Per -OL al 0.01 % produjeron una disminuci\u00f3n de los nivele s de \ncitoquinas pro -inflamatorias, acompa\u00f1ada de una disminuci\u00f3n en la expresi\u00f3n de mediadores pro -\ninflamatorios como la COX.2 e iNOS, regulados por la inactivaci\u00f3n del factor de transcripci\u00f3n \nJAK/STAT y de un incremento en la expresi\u00f3n de la prote\u00edna inhi bitoria I\u03baB -\u03b1. Adem\u00e1s, se produjo \nuna regulaci\u00f3n por la inactivaci\u00f3n tanto de la v\u00eda can\u00f3nica regulada por la caspasa 1, como de la no -\ncan\u00f3nica regulada por la caspasa 11 del complejo proteico del inflamasoma NLRP3, contribuyendo a \nlos efectos beneficiosos  que aporta el enriquecimiento de la dieta con OL y con Per -OL en el manejo \ndel LES experimental.  \n \n6. Las dietas elaboradas con los compuestos fen\u00f3licos OL y Per -OL redujeron significativamente las \nalteraciones histopatol\u00f3gicas renales y mejor\u00f3 la expresi\u00f3n d e diversas prote\u00ednas implicadas en el \nda\u00f1o renal en un modelo murino de LES inducido por pristano, en comparaci\u00f3n con aquellos \nanimales alimentados con una dieta est\u00e1ndar. En este modelo se puso de manifiesto una reducci\u00f3n de \nmarcadores ser\u00f3logicos de infl amaci\u00f3n como las MMP -3, adem\u00e1s de la reducci\u00f3n de mediadores pro -\ninflamatorios como iNOS, PGE 2 y mPGEs -1. Todo ello a trav\u00e9s de la modulaci\u00f3n de las v\u00edas de \nse\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n de las MAP c inasas, NF -\u03baB, JAK/ STAT y Nrf2/HO -1, as\u00ed como de la modulaci\u00f3n del \ncomplej o proteico compuesto por el inflamasoma NLRP3, tanto en su activaci\u00f3n can\u00f3nica como no -\ncan\u00f3nica.  \n \nEn conclusi\u00f3n, esta Tesis Doctoral  proporciona resultados preliminares sobre el papel preventivo y \npaliativo de la OL y de sus derivados acetilados  en el desarrollo de enfermedades \ninmunoinflamatorias como la AR y el LES experimentales. Estos secoiridoides mejoran  el proceso \ninmunoinflamatorio  inducido por lo que podr\u00edan constituir nuevas estrategias sobre las que es \nnecesario profundizar para afianzar el papel de estos compuestos como nutrac\u00e9uticos \u00fatiles para \nprevenir, cambiar el curso e incluso tratar este tipo de enfermedades.  \nSin embargo, el desaf\u00edo actual es confirmar que los resultados in vitro e in vivo mostrados en la \npresente Tesis Doctoral tambi\u00e9n ocurren  tras el consumo de estos compuestos en humanos, \ntraduci\u00e9ndose en un menos riesgo de desarrollar esta s patolog\u00edas de car\u00e1cter inmuno inflamatorias, \npreviniendo la aparici\u00f3n de brotes y disminuyendo los s\u00edntomas asociados a estas enfermedades; lo \ncual requie re de futuros estudios multic\u00e9ntricos de intervenci\u00f3n nutricional, que avalen a la OL y a \nsus derivados como nuevas estrategias nutricionales en el manejo de estas enfermedades.  \n ", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
