Bart Stupak.\n\u201cThe FDA strongly recommends that firms refrain from marketing products that combine or co-package drug and dietary supplement ingredients,\u201d but would be willing to review them for possible approval, then-Associate Commissioner for Policy Margaret Dotzel said in May 2000.\nWhile aspirin is FDA-approved, dietary supplements such as vitamins and herbs are not subject to agency scrutiny before marketing.\nIn the letter to Bayer, HealthCare President Gary Balkema, Michigan Democrats Dingell and Stupak asked whether the company planned to seek FDA approval for the combination product. They also called on the company to provide lawmakers with all related records within two weeks.\n\u201cThe Committee is concerned that your company engaged in DTC (direct-to-consumer) advertising of this product, particularly in light of FDA\u2019s recommendation to refrain from marketing combination products,\u201d they wrote.\nBayer, in a statement, said its advertisements tell consumers to consult their doctors before using Bayer Aspirin with Heart Advantage and warns it does not replace cholesterol medications. The drugmaker added it was reviewing the lawmakers\u2019 letter.\nThe product is sold without a prescription and contains 81 milligrams of aspirin along with 400 milligrams of phytosterols, a plant-based supplement that aims to reduce bad cholesterol.\nThe FDA in 2000 began allowing foods that contain plant sterols to include claims on packaging that they can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease because of their possible impact on cholesterol.\nEarlier this year the American Herbal Products Association called on the FDA to clarify its marketing policy for products that combine over-the-counter medicines with dietary supplements.\nIn a separate letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt, the lawmakers asked whether the FDA or its lawyers were aware of the aspirin marketing or advertisements for any other combination products that include dietary supplements.\nFDA spokeswoman Heidi Rebello said the agency received the lawmakers\u2019 letter and would respond directly to the committee.\nDingell and Stupak have been investigating whether drug companies have misled the public through consumer-targeted advertisements. Other companies with ads under review include Pfizer Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co Inc and Schering Plow Corp.\nThe pharmaceutical industry, through its trade group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), agreed to voluntary guidelines in 2005 to address some marketing concerns.\nThe lawmakers have asked the companies to take further action to curb some advertising practices and have said they are in discussions with PhRMA.\nEditing by Richard Chang and Andre Grenon\nOur Standards:\n[The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)", "language": null, "image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/global-gateway.html", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/login.html", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216467423-Contact-Reuters", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us", "https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/healthNews", "https://www.reuters.com/journalists/susan-heavey", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "//www.reuters.com/tools/mobile", "//newslink.reuters.com/join/subscribe", "//sales.reuters.com/en/ ", "//www.reuters.com/advertising-guidelines", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#cookies", "//www.reuters.com/terms-of-use", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "javascript:window.OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();", "https://www.reuters.com/info/disclaimer", "https://thomsonreuters.com/copyright/"]}
