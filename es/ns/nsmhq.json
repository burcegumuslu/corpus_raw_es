Sunday\nAMAZON GRANDMA\n(AYAHUASCA)\nAyahuasca or Yag\u00e9 is a drink used by the Amazonian indigenous peoples. The effects of its ingestion promote access to extended states of conscience in which internal introspections, diverse emotions and processes of catharsis occur to which the Amazonian traditions recognize a potentially healing value. The ayahuasca experience would facilitate awareness of what is happening in our life and the world, not being aware of it we refuse to see it. These traditional uses should be added to the therapeutic uses proposed and investigated from contemporary science and psychology. Some shamans or healers take ayahuasca to communicate with nature or to observe what is causing illness on a spiritual level in their patients, they drink ayahuasca and sing to enter a healing trance.\nHEALING PROPERTIES\nAyahuasca can be an effective therapy in the field of psychiatry and psychology in the treatment of depression and anxiety as well as personality problems and schizophrenia and has been studied for a long time by doctors, pharmacologists, psychologists and psychiatrists of all over the world as a tool for various problems, with special relevance in helping individuals to break with processes and habits that are harmful to themselves and to others. In fact, its use in detoxification and addiction treatments is a fact in countries such as Brazil and Peru, becoming one of the most cutting-edge treatments for drug addiction. Ayahuasca is not a miracle cure in the sense that you drink the potion and all your problems disappear within a couple of hours. It is, however, in the sense that the effect it causes makes it possible to work with problems in a dynamic and efficient way.\n\u201cThe psychological effects of ayahuasca consumption have been studied by psychiatrists and psychologists for several years. It was determined that the use of psychoactive substances present in some plants can modify the states of consciousness and produce positive therapeutic results in the treatment of diseases such as drug dependence \u201d. (Zavala L\u00f3pez 1995).\nIS IT A DRUG?\nThere are many scientific investigations on the chemistry of ayahuasca and its physiological effects, being able to affirm the following: the toxicity is null; Consumption within a controlled context has no side effects and does not generate addiction, one of its uses being precisely the treatment of dependencies in the detoxification of drug addiction. Although it contains an entheogenic component (DMT), Ayahuasca cannot be considered a drug. Its consumption never occurs outside the ritual context of sacred, spiritual and therapeutic characteristics; a deep introspection takes place that reveals pleasant or repressed experiences, reason why the ludic, recreational use or the dependency is improbable and inappropriate. Instead of generating addiction, it causes the opposite effect due to the unpleasant taste of the concoction and the depth of the experience, being necessary a time between each take to assimilate what happened and integrate what was learned.\n\u201cIt is the tool that allows us to open and travel a path of knowledge and health. (\u2026) Fortunately, the barrier towards mass consumption has not been jumped. Its effects are too solemn for people seeking only frivolous experiences. \" (Fericgla 2001)\nIS THERE A \"BAD TRIP\"?\nThe fear The most common is a so-called \u201cbad trip\u201d, which for many people is actually something positive because it means that you are seeing your fears and you have the opportunity to identify and face them, in case the patient requires it, will search try to infuse it serenity and confidence to help you in your process, using flowery waters and songs.\nCEREMONY DYNAMICS\nThe entire traditional ceremony is guided by the shaman through songs. In the traditional ceremony, these songs are called icaros and they are sung to Mother Ayahuasca so that she gives access to the healer to see and heal the patient. Having the opportunity to receive Ayahuasca Medicine is something important, it is not a \u201c chance \u201d, letting us know that perhaps it was time to go further in the process of self-discovery. In general, it marks a before and after because the decisions made after the decision are usually adapted to a better focus on relationships, work, creativity and, of course, the consideration and integration of spirituality in everyday life. After an opening ceremony and taking the medicine, the effects last between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on each person, body weight and their personal psychological process. The effect it produces is called dizziness, similar to being dizzy. manifesting itself through colorful visions, scenes such as are lived in dreams and / or deep introspection with such clarity that from this heightened state of consciousness it is much easier for us to resolve everyday issues (such as relationships) and have a better attitude in life daily.\n\"Thanks to the ecstatic effect of ayahuasca and its ability to reveal the unconscious, it is used as an effective tool in psychotherapy to treat compulsive behaviors and personal growth processes.\" (Fericgla 2001)\nAll the Ayahuasca takes are different, so this is in no way a guide, but I will try to explain in a general way the main points to live within the shot. In the case of a ritual ceremony, generally the Taita or shaman who guides opens the ceremony smoking tobacco, asking for blessing and protection from God the Father, Mother Ayahuasca and the spirits of the jungle so that he and the participants can receive the healing and openness that Ayahuasca usually gives, the taita or shaman take medicine just like participants. Then each one comes to sit in front of the healer to drink the concoction, asking and thanking personally for their personal purpose, there are many variants in this context so that each guide who does a ritualistic ceremony can add elements or do it in a very simple way. of the rules when taking Ayahuasca Medicine\n1.- As far as possible stay seated. It is easier to control the effects when sitting than when lying down, where we can sometimes feel a lot of confusion.\n2.- It is important to maintain silence, since the experience is fundamentally introspective and individual, to avoid disturbing and provoking conversations with the participants, as well as other noises with hands or feet. Ayahuasca intensifies perception and all sounds acquire great intensity.\n3.- Do not lose sight of and keep the bag or bucket that is given at hand in case the medicine causes vomiting and ask for support if there is a need to go to the bathroom.\nPREVENTION FOR THOSE WHO TAKE MEDICATION\nEven though ancestral medicines do not represent a risk by themselves, there are some restrictions that it

It is an experience capable of changing life, with a loving spirit that leads to an awakening of consciousness. In each ceremony, energetic cleanses are performed with mapacho tobacco (Peruvian), pure copal (Mexican) along with other healing elements, and live medicine music is also used (songs, drums, etc.). Among the ancestral medicines we work with Rap\u00e9 (very beneficial for respiratory problems, migraines and decalcification of the pineal gland) and Xanga, more information is detailed below. Everything is done in a ritual context of respect, knowledge and love, where the medicine servant works individually with each person.\nABOUT THE XANGA\nXanga is a mixture that combines the organic molecule of DMT (also called \"The Molecule Of God\") with medicinal plants. Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a visionary substance, the most powerful entheogen known to date. It does not cause dependency or addiction, on the contrary, it removes drug addictions and promotes spiritual liberation. Its dynamics are very pleasant, it does not generate nausea or discomfort. With Xanga, people have access to their own physical and mental processes through highly symbolic images, similar to dreams. You can solve difficult personal problems and feel better. It encompasses near-death experiences or experiences of spiritual content, a \"complete and radical\" separation between consciousness and body can be experienced; you can have death and resurrection experiences and mystical experiences. Mind and body are quieted, contact is often made with the ineffable. All of this generally works to clear the mind, align the psyche, and fulfill the spirit. One of the benefits of a session with this medicine is that people are then able to move on with their lives with more perspective and many times more motivation. DMT is a very powerful catalyst for change, the Xanga in addition to being a stress reliever, can open the mind and allows a special and novel experience. For more information it is recommended to see the documentary \"DMT: The spiritual molecule\", available on YouTube.\nBENEFITS\nThe DMT molecule is without a doubt the most sacred substance that exists on earth. The effect of introspection, understanding and raising of consciousness of the medicine lasts for several days after its ingestion, although well, it does not generate a hangover after its consumption and activities can be continued normally. Here is a list of the medicine's proven benefits:\n\u2022 Liberator of conscious or unconscious loads.\n\u2022 Eliminate stress through great physical and mental relaxation.\n\u2022 Helps to cure psychosomatic illnesses.\n\u2022 It can attack physical ailments, from the astral plane.\n\u2022 Helps to understand the meaning of meditation and go to the depths of being.\n\u2022 Allows you to face fears, anger, jealousy, envy, etc.\n\u2022 Deep release of traumatic emotional charges.\n\u2022 The pineal gland is activated and detoxified.\n\u2022 It reconnects you with your soul and integrates it into your body.\n\u2022 Put aside fears and negative programming.\n\u2022 You give freedom and peace to your mind promoting healing from depression and anguish.\n\u2022 You open your heart deeply.\n\u2022 Feeling of being born again.\n\u2022 Luminous reset of mind, spirit and body.\n\u2022 Discover the purpose of your life.\n\u2022 Improve relationships.\n\u2022 Activation of the third eye.\n\u2022 Increased positive self-esteem.\n\u2022 Relief from physical and mental pain.\n\u2022 Encounter real and true answers from the bottom of your being.\n\u2022 Communication with other spiritual entities.\n\u2022 Provides clarity of mind and ideas for many months after use.\n\u2022 Gives confidence and willpower.\n\u2022 You discover God within yourself.\n\u2022 Healing of jobs and damages related to Santeria.\n\u2022 Promoter of the liberation of addictions to drugs and harmful substances.\nWHAT IS THE CEREMONY LIKE?\nIt begins with a general explanation of medicine and dynamics.

In the middle of the process, the guide performs songs and prayers to enhance the end of healing. After everyone has passed, those who require a second take of the medicine, it is done without problems. Each shot lasts about 30 min. The ceremony in its entirety can be around 4 or 5 hours.\nRECOMMENDATIONS AND PREVIOUS COMMENTS\n\u2022 Refrain if your purpose is simply to experiment.

This practice guides people into deep meditation through the use of a shamanic drum beaten steadily to a rhythm that induces thetha waves in the brain, which can bring about deep connections and insights of a spiritual nature. The power of the drum is such that many even testify experiences similar to working with master plants. This practice will be guided by a team of traditional doctors and will be linked with a collective closing integration. The specific meditation with a live drum is 60 minutes, the remaining time being for orientation and subsequent integration of experiences. In this experience we will be able to connect with mystical experiences, identify problems of the physical body, feel the movements of subtle energy and much more.\nPROPERTIES\nThe drum has great power to help us heal physical, emotional and mental issues, capture spiritual visions, experience healing and feel energy at unsuspected levels. It is a great help for those who have never been able to meditate and a powerful tool for those who want to go even deeper into themselves. Among the testimonies that have been collected, there are specific physical healings, mystical experiences, connection with the divine and much more.\nMore information and inscriptions:\n+52 55 2948 8608", "language": null, "image": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/475827_106402d493574b008e9cbc8adc19aeb7~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1920,h_1005,al_c/475827_106402d493574b008e9cbc8adc19aeb7~mv2.jpg", "pagetype": "website", "links": ["https://en.medicinatrascendental.com", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/terapias", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/biblia-personal", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/tratamientos-herbolarios", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/tratamientos-energeticos", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/kambo", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/sananga", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/sinicuchi", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/psicoarquetipos", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/circuito-terapeutico", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/reiki-biomagnetismo", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/nucleo", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/clarividencia", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/testimonios", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/xanga-molecula-espiritual", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/tambor-chamanico", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/gran-tambor-chamanico", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/numa-medicina", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/wachuma", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/ayahuasca", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/mapa-del-destino", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/hongos", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/rape", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/temazcal", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/trabajo-de-montana", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/mamacuna", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/jampicamayoc", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/inti-miski", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/jesus", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/galo", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/calendario", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/gira-mamacuna", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/europa-2023", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/retiro-wachuma", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/viajes-a-per\u00fa", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/blog", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/reservas", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/privacidad", "https://wa.me/message/KWJELW3JZEPHG1", "https://www.instagram.com/medicinatrascendental", "https://www.facebook.com/medicinatrascendental/", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsdkwC77y_Ssd-FVQcc23_g", "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0rkU4oLR2XZK5JqftiP4MV?si=66TDB2sTRpebJE3bgd8QJw", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/wachuma", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/xanga-molecula-espiritual", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/tambor-chamanico", "https://wa.me/message/KWJELW3JZEPHG1", "https://wa.me/message/KWJELW3JZEPHG1?fbclid=IwAR30CH-__Vkm4TYCFuorLWGguMfF1Fc43CXunY0gt23JRcOld8hwsX0-aZw", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/privacidad", "https://en.medicinatrascendental.com/copia-de-ceremonias-de-sanaci\u00f3n-mdp"]}
