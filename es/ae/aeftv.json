Grant, of the Center for Complementary Medicine Research at the University of Western Sydney, in Australia, told Reuters Health in an email.\nMany of the trials her team examined, she explained, had a \u201chigh risk of bias\u201d that can overestimate the effects of the treatments.\nThe gold standard for proving a treatment\u2019s efficacy is a clinical trial where participants are randomly assigned to receive either the real treatment or a placebo, with both the researchers and participants unaware of who is taking the real drug.\nGrant\u2019s team found that those processes were often absent or not clearly detailed in the trials they reviewed.\nSo, she said, there is still a need for more rigorous trials before any herbal product can be recommended for diabetes prevention.\nThe studies included a total of 1,391 men and women with either impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose -- problems in blood-sugar control that lead to sugar levels that are elevated, but not high enough to diagnose diabetes.\nThe studies tested various Chinese herbal mixes traditionally used for blood-sugar control -- products like Jiangtang Bushen, Xiaoke huaya and Tang Kang yin.\nIn most trials, the products were added to lifestyle changes and tested against the effects of lifestyle changes alone -- though the specific changes were not detailed in most reports.\nGrant suggested that if people with pre-diabetes do want to try an herbal product, they first consult their doctor and, ideally, take any herbs under a guidance of a health provider qualified in herbal medicine.\nShe pointed out that in traditional Chinese medicine, herbs are recommended based on individuals\u2019 unique situations, and not as a one-size-fits-all prescription.\nAs far as safety, the review found no serious side effects attributed to the herbal products. However, Grant noted, like all medicines, herbs have the potential for unexpected side effects or interactions with other drugs.\nSOURCE: Cochrane Library, online October 7, 2009.\nOur Standards:\n[The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)", "language": null, "image": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20091014&t=2&i=11946894&r=2009-10-14T165525Z_01_BTRE59D1B0J00_RTROPTP_0_SINGAPORE&w=800", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/global-gateway.html", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/login.html", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216467423-Contact-Reuters", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us", "https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/healthNews", "https://www.reuters.com/journalists/amy-norton", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "//www.reuters.com/tools/mobile", "//newslink.reuters.com/join/subscribe", "//sales.reuters.com/en/ ", "//www.reuters.com/advertising-guidelines", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#cookies", "//www.reuters.com/terms-of-use", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "javascript:window.OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();", "https://www.reuters.com/info/disclaimer", "https://thomsonreuters.com/copyright/"]}
