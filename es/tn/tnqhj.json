Several studies have demonstrat ed that different extracts of V. thapsus  present antimicrobial \nactivity. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the ge notoxic and cytotoxic activities of a methanolic extract of Verbascum thapsus , \nusing micronucleus test in mouse bone marrow.  No toxicity in bone marrow was detected  in the extract-treated groups. The methan olic \nextract of V. thapsus  at doses of 100, 300 and 500 mg / kg, did not produce a si gnificant increase in the frequency of MNPCE in bone \nmarrow and neither altered the relationship PCE / NCE respect to negative control. Th ese cytogenotoxic findings contribute the preclinical \nknowledge of methanolic extract of V. thapsus  and provide security in its use as herbal medicine. \n \nKeywords: Verbascum thapsus  L., methanolic extract, micronuc leus, bone marrow, genotoxicity. \n \n \n \nThe use of medicinal plants in therapy or as dietary \nsupplements remounts centuries ago, but it has increased \nsubstantially in the last decades [1a,1b]. The popularity of herbal medicines is related to their easy access, therapeutic \nefficacy, relatively low cost, and assumed absence of toxic \neffects.  \nWidespread public opinion is that being a natural product, \nherbal medicines are harmless and free from adverse effects. However, the safety of their use has recently been \nquestioned due to the reports of illness and fatalities      \n[2a-2c]. Considering the complexity of herbals in general \nand their inherent biological variation, it is now necessary \nto evaluate their safety, effica cy and quality [1b]. Thus, an \nassessment of their mutagenic and cytotoxic potential is \nnecessary to ensure the relatively safe use of plant-derived \nmedicines.   \nScrophulariaceae is an important family of plants \ncomprising over 200 genera and about 2500 species. It includes Mimulus , Penstemon , Digitalis , Veronica and \nVerbascum [3a]. Different members have been valued for \ntheir curative properties and are widely employed in \ndomestic and regular medicine. At least 250 species of \nVerbascum are known. Among the species traditionally \nused in medicine, the most important is Verbascum \nthapsus L., commonly known as mullein, common mullein, great mullein [3b].  V. thapsus  is distributed \nworldwide. In Argentina this species is abundant however; \nit is considered an exotic plant.  Many studies carried      \nout with plants collected in other countries, have shown \nthat different extracts have antimicrobial, antitumor       \nand cytotoxic activities [4a-4c]. Therefore, given the abundance of the species in C\u00f3 rdoba province, Argentina, \ncytotoxic and antiviral properties of methanolic extract of \nV. thapsus were investigated . The results of these previous \nstudies have indicated that th e extract markedly inhibits \nHerpes suis virus  type 1 at non cytotoxic concentrations \n[5a,5b]. Since this information is hopeful, it is necessary to \ndefine the cytogenotoxic potential to ensure the use of the \nextract at safe levels.  \nThe aim of this study was to determine the genotoxic and \ncytotoxic activities of a methanolic extract of Verbascum \nthapsus , using micronucleus test in mouse bone marrow. \nEvaluation of micronucleus induction is the primary in \nvivo test in a battery of genotoxicity tests and is \nrecommended by the regulatory  worldwide agencies to be \nconducted as part of product safety assessment. \n The results of micronucleus (MN) test in BALB/c mice \ntreated with different doses of  the extract are summarized \nin Table 1. In all cases these results are expressed as mean (\u00b1 standard deviation). \n NPC Natural Product Communications 2011 \nVol. 6 \nNo. 7 \n989 - 991\n \n 990  Natural Product Communications  Vol. 6 (7) 2011 Escobar et al. \n \nTable 1 : Mean of polychromatic erythrocytes with micronuclei (MNPCE) obser ved in bone marrow cell of female  (F) and male (M) BALB/c mice  treated with \na Verbascum thapsus  methanolic extract, a nd respective controls. \n \nTreatments Dose \nmg/kg Number of MNPCE per animal MNPCE \n(mean \u00b1 SD) PCE/NCE \n(mean \u00b1 SD) \n  F 1 F 2 F 3 M 1 M 2 M 3   \nNegative control (saline) 0 2 3 3 2 2 2 2.50 \u00b1 0.55 1.69 \u00b1 0.14 \nV. thapsus  methanolic extract 100 1 2 5 1 3 1 2.17 \u00b1 1.60 1.77 \u00b1 0.12 \nV. thapsus  methanolic extract 300 3 1 3 1 2 2 2.00 \u00b1 0.89 1.79 \u00b1 0.23 \nV. thapsus  methanolic extract 500 5 1 1 2 1 2 2.00 \u00b1 1.55 1.74 \u00b1 0.15 \nPositive control (cyclophophamide) 20 11 14 11 13 9 12 11.7 \u00b1 1.7* 1.69 \u00b1 0.10 \nThousand cells were analyzed per animal, for a total of 6000 cells  per group.

However, there was a \nsignificant increase in the frequency of micronucleus in \nPCE from the positive control group treated with cyclophosphamide (Figure 2). \n \nNo citotoxicity in bone marrow was detected in the extract-treated groups. Statisti cal analysis of the proportion \nPCE / NCE revealed no differences in any study group. \nThere were no sex-dependent changes in any treatment. \n V. thapsus  methanolic  extract contains iridoid glycosides \n(laterioside, harpagoside, ajugol, picroside IV), three \niridoid ((+)-genipin, \u03b1-gardiol and \u03b2-gardiol), one \nphenylethyl glycoside (verbacoside), two sesquiterpenes \n(buddlindeterpene A and buddlindeterpene B), one \nditerpene (buddlindeterpene C), and one biflavonoid (amentoflavone) [6].  \n \n \n    \n \n   \n \n \n \nFigure 2 : Frequency of Micronucleated Polychromatic Erythrocytes \n(MNPCE) induced in bone-marrow ce lls of female (F) and male (M) \nBALB/c mice treated with a V. thapsus  methanolic extract: negative \ncontrol (saline solution), positive control (cyclophosphamide 20 mg/kg body weight). Values are shown as mean \u00b1 SD. \n \nTherefore, the results obtained in the present study allow \nconcluding that the methanolic extract of Verbascum \nthapsus  does not contain genotoxic and cytotoxic \ncompounds since its administration in mice at doses of 100, 300 and 500 mg/kg, showed no evidence of \ngenotoxicity or cytotoxicity in vivo . The extract did not \nproduce a significant increase in the frequency of MNPCE \nin bone marrow and neither altered the relationship PCE / \nNCE respect to negative control. \n These cytogenotoxic findings contribute the preclinical \nknowledge of metha nolic extract of V. thapsus  and provide \nsecurity in its use as herbal medicine.  \nExperimental \n \nPlant material and extraction: Aerial parts of Verbascum \nthapsus  L. were collected in San Luis province, Argentina. \nThe plant material was identified by Ing. Luis A. del Vitto. \nA voucher specimen (N\u00b0 #514) was preserved and \ndeposited in herbal library of the \u201cHerbario de la Universidad Nacional de San Luis, Argentina\u201d. The leaves \nwere dried and chopped finely using a blender. Eight \nhundred grams of dried material were successively extracted with 3.5 L of the following solvents: n-hexane, \nchloroform and methanol at room temperature for 48 h. \nThe evaporation of the extracts in vacuum at 40\u00baC yielded \nControl (-)100 mg/kg\n300 mg/kg\n500 mg/kg Control (+)0510152025\nFemaleMaleMNPCE / 1000 PCEMNPCE \nNCE \nPCE NCE Genotoxic evaluation of a methanolic extract of Verbascum thapsus  Natural Product Communications  Vol. 6 (7) 2011 991 \nthe hexane, chloroform and methanol extracts. The \nmethanolic extract was dissolved in saline solution and \nsubsequently diluted to appropriate working \nconcentrations.  \nAnimal\u2019s treatments: Two months old male/female \nBALBc mice weighing ca. 20 g were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of V. thapsus  methanolic \nextract (volume 0.2 ml). Thr ee doses were selected (100, \n300 and 500 mg/kg) considering previous citotoxicity data obtained with Vero cells. Cyclophosphamide (Sigma) at 20 \nmg/kg and saline solution were used as positive and \nnegative controls respectively.  \n \nMouse bone marrow micronuclei assay:  Six mice per \ndose were sacrificed at 24 h post-injection and femurs \nwere removed. Femurs were prepared for the boned-\nmarrow micronucleus test as previously described [7a].  Slides were stained with May-Gr\u00fcnwald and Giemsa \nsolutions [7b] which maximized the differentiation \nbetween the polychromatic (PCE) and normochromatic \n(NCE) erythrocytes. To determine index of genotoxicity the number of micronucleated  polychromatic erythrocytes \n(MNPCE) was obtained at an average of 1000 PCE, \ncounted per animal per dose. In order to evaluate any cytotoxic effect of extract , the ratio of PCE/NCE was \ndetermined in the same sample. Statistical significance was \ndetermined by analysis of variance (ANOVA), applying software GraphPad Prism 5.0. \n \nAcknowledgments  - The authors are grateful to \nCONICET, MinCyT of C\u00f3rdoba, Universidad Nacional de \nR\u00edo Cuarto and PICTOR program, BID 1728 /OC-AR for financial support.
