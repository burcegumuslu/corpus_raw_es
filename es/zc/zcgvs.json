In this technique, sterile needles are inserted into specific points in the body to stimulate the flow of energy (\u201cqi\u201d) thereby helping the body\u2019s natural healing response.\nPain Management\nAcupuncture addresses and heals chronic pain and helps in pain management.\nBeauty Enhancement\nCosmetic acupuncture is effective in preventing premature wrinkling of facial skin.\nVaidya Parla Jayagopal is one of the most gifted and beautiful spirited ayurvedic doctors and teacher I have met and worked with.

Namaste \ud83d\ude42\nHace tres anos fui diagnosticada con c\u00e1ncer de mama, un tumor mucinoso en el pecho izquierdo el cual fue extraido quir\u00fargicamente, fui sometida a 30 dias de radiaci\u00f3n. Al ano siguiente al realizarme un estudio el diagnostico fue una severa inflamacion en diversos \u00f3rganos de mi cuerpo tales como medula osea, ovarios, timo, bazo y una adenopat\u00eda en un ganglio de mama por lo que me reliazaron 10 radiaciones mas.\nI initially went to see Vaidya Jay at the request of my daughter. She had been to him and couldn't say enough good things about him. I was apprehensive at first. I'm a middle aged woman who was overweight, high cholesterol, and heading toward pre diabetes. Upon meeting Vaidya Jay, he puts you at ease right away. He listens very patiently, and has a way that I've never encountered with any other Vaidya of breaking everything down for you. He gets to the root of the problem which in return everything begins to make sense and falls into place.\nMore Wellness\n[Yoga](https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/yoga/)\nYoga is a mind-body coordination workout combining poses and practices that calm the mind and strengthens the body.\n[Diet & Lifestyle](https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/diet-lifestyle/)\nAn Ayurvedic diet is one customized for your body type based on your doshas and several factors specific to you and your health.\n[Beauty Care](https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/beauty-care/)\nEliminating toxins, enhancing blood flow and resetting the functions of skin help bring about renewed sense of balance to the body and mind.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": "article", "links": ["#", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/cart/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/about-us/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/about-us/#about", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/about-us/#team", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/about-us/#approach", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/contact-us/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/therapies/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/consultation/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/therapies/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/panchakarma/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/wellness/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/yoga/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/diet-lifestyle/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/acupuncture/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/beauty-care/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/classes-seminars-2/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/classes-seminars-2/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/ayurvedicforum/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/lifestyle/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/blogs/", "#", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/videos/", "https://www.athreyaherbs.com/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/yoga/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/yoga/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/diet-lifestyle/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/diet-lifestyle/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/beauty-care/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/beauty-care/", "mail:info@myathreya.com", "https://www.facebook.com/Athreya-Ayurveda-1431984973524858", "#", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN0TGxOul3kc1opQt2Mhxgw", "https://www.instagram.com/athreyaayurveda/", "https://www.athreyaayurveda.com/", "http://bizmethsolutions.com/", "#top"]}
