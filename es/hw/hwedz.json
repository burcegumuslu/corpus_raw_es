One day my father told me to weed the corn while he weeded the potatoes. As I worked my way down a row of six-inch-high (15 cm) corn, I found a solitary potato plant growing larger and more beautiful than any of the potato plants on Dad\u2019s side of the garden. I called to him and asked, \u201cWhat should I do with this?\u201d\nDad barely looked up. \u201cPull it.\u201d\nBelieving he hadn\u2019t realized I was pointing to a potato plant, I objected, \u201cBut Dad, it isn\u2019t a weed. It\u2019s a potato.\u201d Again, without looking up, he said, \u201cNot this year. This year it\u2019s a weed. Pull it.\u201d So I did.\nSince then I have often pondered the wisdom of my father\u2019s words. I have come to realize that obedience is not just making a right choice but making a right choice in the right season. When I consider all the things Heavenly Father would have me do in this life, doing them at the right time seems as critical as doing them at all. For instance, serving a mission, dating, getting married, having children, gaining an education, and beginning full-time employment are right choices. Yet when people do these good things in the wrong order, the consequences are often disastrous.\nKing Benjamin taught that we should \u201csee that all \u2026 things are done in wisdom and order\u201d (\n[Mosiah 4:27](/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.27?lang=eng#p27)). Elder Neal A. Maxwell (1926\u20132004) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught, \u201cFaith also includes trust in God\u2019s timing, for He has said, \u2018All things must come to pass in their time\u2019 ( [D&C 64:32](/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.32?lang=eng#p32)).\u201d [1](/study/liahona/2011/07/this-year-its-a-weed-pull-it?lang=eng#note1)\nI believe Satan deceives us by convincing us to do the right things in the wrong order: sexual intimacy before marriage, dating before age 16, becoming a parent and then getting married, and so forth. The greatest commandments of God, when compromised or polluted, become plants grown out of season\u2014weeds. When I have been tempted to justify doing the right thing in the wrong season, I have been grateful for my father\u2019s important lesson: \u201cNot this year. This year it\u2019s a weed.
