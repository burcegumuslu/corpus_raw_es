However, longevity is a true blessing only if it is coupled with good health. Healthiness, in today's expectation, is not simply a disease free state. Rather, it is very much a state of wellbeing and competence, both physically and socially. While Oriental medicine emphasizes on the promotion of physiological balance and internal balance as an integral requirement for longevity, other cultures also have various sophisticated concepts and orientations. This book successfully collates all the different views and approaches from Austria, Russia, China and Japan in the exploration of Health, Wellbeing, Competence and Aging.\nContents:\nChinese Medicine Has a Lot to Offer (Ping-Chung Leung)\nExtended View of a Bio-Psycho-Socio-Eco-Cultural Model and the Self-Understanding of Western Medicine and New Public Health (Walter Kofler)\nThe Hong Kong Cadenza Philosophy (Ruby Yu and Jean Woo)\nLongevity, Life Satisfaction, Money and Aging (David Schnaiter)\nUnderstanding Between Generations: A Practicable Way to Help Create a Society Fit for All Ages (Christa Erhart, Susanne Schinagl and Peter Erhart)\nThe Life as a Struggle for Immortality: History of Ideas in Russian Gerontology (With Immunoneuroendocrine Bias)(Leonid P Churilov and Yury I Stroev)\nPromoting Elderly Health in Hong Kong: Strategies and Actions (Wai Man Chan)\nIntegrative Medicine and Anti-Aging in Japan (Kazuhiko Atsumi)\nMedical Resonance Therapy Music (Dr Ernest H M, Ma)\nNeuroscience and Meditation (Tatia M C Lee, Nerissa S P Ho, Jing Yin, Chack-Fan Lee, Chetwyn C H Chan and Kwok-Fai So)\nShaolin Mind-Body Exercise as a Neurophyschological Intervention (Agnes Suiyin Chan and Sophia Laiman Sze)\nNear-Infrared (NIR) Spectroscopy as a Tool for Quality Control of Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicines (Lukas Bittner, Stefan Sch\u00f6nbichler and Christian Huck)\nReadership: Public health specialists and departments; health policy departments in ministries of health and universities, Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners, Chinese medicine educators, clinical and basic Chinese medicine researchers and health science students (particularly Chinese medicine students), herbalists, gerontology researchers, nutritionists, clinicians in Western medicine, medical researchers, World Health Organization and affiliated institutions, and pharmaceutical companies.\nEdited by: Ping-Chung Leung (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong); Jean Woo (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong); Walter Kofler (Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria & President of International Academy of Science H&E, Austria).\n[Tel 91 593 99 99](tel:003491 593 99 99)\nFax 91 448 21 88\n[Dir](/contacto)\nC/ Artesanos, 46\nC/ Artesanos, 46\nParque Empresarial Prado del Espino\n28660 Boadilla del Monte\nMadrid\n[Mailinfo@axon.es](mailto:info@axon.es)\n\u00a9 2023 Ax\u00f3n Librer\u00eda S.L.\n2.87.2", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["/", null, "/resultados/tags/libros/wellness | bienestar | equilibrio saludable", "/resultados/tags/libros/medicina natural | medicina integrativa", "http://media.axon.es/pdf/99184.pdf", "tel:003491 593 99 99", "/contacto", "mailto:info@axon.es", "/privacidad", "/condiciones", "/quienes-somos", "/aviso-legal", "/contacto", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/axon-libreria", "https://www.pinterest.es/axonlibreria/", "https://twitter.com/axonlibreria", "https://www.facebook.com/libreriaaxon"]}
