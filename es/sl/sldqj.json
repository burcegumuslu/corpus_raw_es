Sediment functions as a reservoir for \ncommon contaminants such as pesticides, herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). \npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. and metals such as lead. mercury, and arsenic. In- \nplace contaminated sediment can result in depauparate benthic communities. while \ndisposal of contaminated dredge material can potentially exert adverse effects on both \npelagic and benthic systems. Historically. assessment of sediment quality has been \nlimited to chemical characterizations. The United States Environmental Protection \nAgency (USEPA) is developing methodologies to calculate chemical-specific sediment \nquality criteria for use in the Agency\u2018s regulatory programs. However. quantifying \ncontaminant concentrations alone cannot always provide enough information to \nadequately evaluate potential adverse effects that arise from interactions among \nchemicals, or that result from time-dependent availability of sediment-associated \ncontaminants to aquatic organisms. Because relationships between concentrations of \ncontaminants in sediment and bioavailability are not fully understood. determination of \ncontaminated sediment effects on aquatic organisms may require the use of controlled \ntoxicity and bioaccumulation tests. \nAs part of USEPA\u2018s Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy, all Agency \nprograms have agreed to use the same methods to determine whether sediments have the \npotential to affect aquatic ecosystems. More than ten Federal statutes provide authority \nto many USEPA program offices to address the problem of contaminated sediment. The \nsediment test methods in this manual will be used by USEPA to make decisions under a \nrange of statutory authorities concerning such issues as: dredged material disposal. \nregistration of pesticides and toxic substances. Superfund site assessment. and \nassessment and cleanup of hazardous waste treatment. storage, and disposal facilities. \nThe use of uniform sediment testing procedures by USEPA programs is expected to \nincrease data accuracy and precision, facilitate test replication. increase the comparative \nvalue of test results, and, ultimately, increase the efficiency of regulatory processes \nrequiring sediment tests. \nFor additional guidance on the technical considerations in the manual. please contact \nRick Swartz. USEPA, Newport, OR. \niii \nAbstract \nA laboratory method is described for determining the short-term toxicity of \ncontaminated whole sediments using marine and estuarine amphipod crustaceans. \nSediments may be collected from estuarine or marine environments or spiked with \ncompounds in the laboratory. A test method is outlined that may be used with any of \nfour amphipod species. including Ampelisca abditu, Eohaustorius estuarius, Leptocheirus \nplumuhsus, and Rhepoxynius abronius. The toxicity test is conducted for 10 d in 1 L \nglass chambers containing 175 mL of sediment and 800 mL of overlying water. \nOverlying water is not renewed, and test organisms are not fed during the toxicity tests. \nTemperature and salinity of overlying water, and choice of negative control sediment. \nare species-specific. The choice of reference sediment may also be species-specific under \ncertain applications. The endpoint in the toxicity test is survival, and reburial of \nsurviving amphipods is an additional measurement that can be used as an endpoint. \nProcedures are described for use with sediments from oligohaline to fully marine \nenvironments. \niv \nAcknowledgements \nThis document is a general purpose testing manual for estuarine and marine sediments. \nThe approaches have also been described in Swartz et al.

In the aquatic environment. most anthropogenic chemicals and waste \nmaterials including toxic organic and inorganic chemicals eventually accumulate in \nsediment. Mounting evidence exists of environmental degradation in areas where \nUSEPA Water Quality Criteria (WQC) are not exceeded. yet organisms in or near \nsediments are adversely affected (Chapman, 1989). The WQC were developed to protect \norganisms in the water column and were not intended to protect organisms in sediment. \nConcentrations of contaminants in sediment may be several orders of magnitude higher \nthan in the overlying water; however, bulk sediment concentrations have not been \nstrongly correlated to bioavailability (Burton. 1991). Partitioning or sorption of a \ncompound between water and sediment may depend on many factors including: aqueous \nsolubility, pH; redox, affinity for sediment organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon. \ngrain size of the sediment, sediment mineral constituents (oxides of iron. manganese. and \naluminum), and the quantity of acid volatile sulfides in sediment (Di Toro et at., 1990: \nDi Toro et al., 1991). Although certain chemicals are highly sorbed to sediment. these \ncompounds may still be available to the biota. Contaminated sediments may be directly \ntoxic to aquatic life or can be a source of contaminants for bioaccumulation in the food \nchain. \n1.1.2 Assessments of sediment quality have commonly included sediment chemical \nanalyses and surveys of benthic community structure. Determination of sediment \ncontaminant concentrations on a dry weight basis alone offers little insight into \npredicting adverse biological effects because bioavailability may be limited by the \nintricate partitioning factors mentioned above. Likewise, benthic community surveys \nmay be inadequate because they sometimes fail to discriminate between effects of \ncontaminants and those that result from unrelated non-contaminant factors, including \nwater quality fluctuations, physical parameters, and biotic interactions. In order to \nobtain a direct measure of sediment toxicity, laboratory tests have been developed in \nwhich surrogate organisms are exposed to sediments under controlled conditions. \nSediment toxicity tests have evolved into effective tools providing direct. quantifiable \nevidence of biological consequences of sediment contamination that can only be inferred \nfrom chemical or benthic community analyses. The USEPA is developing a national \ninventory of contaminated sediment sites. This inventory will be used to develop a \nbiennial report to Congress on sediment quality in the United States required under the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1992. The use of consistent sediment testing \nmethods will provide high quality data needed for the national inventory and for \nregulatory programs to prevent, remediate, and manage contaminated sediment \n(Southerland et al., 1991). \n1.1.3 The objective of a sediment test is to determine whether contaminants in sediment \nare harmful to or are bioaccumulated by benthic organisms. The tests can be used to \nmeasure interactive toxic effects of complex contaminant mixtures in sediment. \nFurthermore. knowledge of specific pathways of interactions among sediments and test \norganisms is not necessary in order to conduct the tests (Kemp and Swartz. 1988). \nSediment tests can be used to: (1) determine the relationship between toxic effects and \nbioavailability. (2) investigate interactions among contaminants. (3) compare the \nsensitivities of different organisms, (4) determine spatial and temporal distribution of \ncontamination. (5) evaluate hazards of dredged material. (6) measure toxicity as part of \nproduct licensing or safety testing or chemical approval, (7) rank areas for clean up. and \n(8) set cleanup goals and estimate the effectiveness of remediation or management \npractices. \n1.1.1 Results of toxicity tests on sediments spiked at different concentrations of \ncontaminants can be used to establish cause and effect relationships between chemicals \nand biological responses. Results of toxicity tests with test materials spiked into \nsediments at different concentrations may be reported in terms of an LC50 (median \nlethal concentration). an EC50 (median effect concentration). an ICW (inhibition \nconcentration), or as a NOEC (no observed effect concentration) or LOEC (lowest \nobserved effect concentration). However, spiked sediment may not be representative of \ncontaminated sediment in the field. Mixing time (Stemmer et al., 1990a) and aging \n(Word et al.. 1987: Landrum, 1989: Landrum and Faust, 1992) of spiked sediment can \naffect responses. \n1.1.5 Evaluating effect concentrations for chemicals in sediment requires knowledge of \nfactors controlling their bioavailability. Similar concentrations of a chemical in units of \nmass of chemical per mass of sediment dry weight often exhibit a range in toxicity in \ndifferent sediments (Di Toro et at., 1990; Di Toro et al.. 1991). Effect concentrations of \nchemicals in sediment have been correlated to interstitial water concentrations. and \neffect concentrations in interstitial water are often similar to effect concentrations in \nwater-only exposures. The bioavailability of non-ionic organic compounds in sediment is \noften inversely correlated with the organic carbon concentration. Whatever the route of \nexposure. these correlations of effect concentrations to interstitial water concentrations \nindicate that predicted or measured concentrations in interstitial water can be used to \nquantify the exposure concentration to an organism. Therefore, information on \npartitioning of chemicals between solid and liquid phases of sediment is useful for \nestablishing effect concentrations (Di Toro et al., 1991). \n1.1.6 Field surveys can be designed to provide either a qualitative reconnaissance of the \ndistribution of sediment contamination or a quantitative statistical comparison of \ncontamination among sites. Surveys of sediment toxicity are usually part of more \ncomprehensive analyses of biological, chemical, geological, and hydrographic data. \nStatistical correlations may be improved and sampling costs may be reduced if \nsubsamples are taken simultaneously for sediment tests. chemical analyses. and benthic \ncommunity structure. \n2 \n1.1.8 Table 1.1 lists several approaches the USEPA has considered for the assessment of \nsediment quality (USEP.4, 1992~). These approaches include: (1) equilibrium \npartitioning, (2) tissue residues, (3) interstitial water toxicity, (4) whole sediment toxicity \nand sediment-spiking tests, (5) benthic community structure. and (6) Sediment Quality \nTriad and Range Effects median (see Chapman, 1989: LSEPA, 1989a: LSEP.4, 1YYOa: \nI-SEP.4, 1990b; and USEPA, 19Y2b for a critique of these methods). The sediment \nassessment approaches listed in Table 1.1 can be classified as numeric (e.g., equiiibriunl \npartitioning), descriptive (e.g.. whole sediment toxicity tests), or a combination of \nnumeric and descriptive approaches (e.g., Apparent Effects Threshold: I\u2019SEP.4, lYY2c). \nNumeric methods can be used to derive chemical-specific sediment quality criteria \n(SQC). Descriptive methods such as toxicity tests with field-collected sediment cannot be \nused alone to develop numerical SQC for individual chemicals. Although each approach \ncan be used to make site-specific decisions. no one single approach can adequately \naddress sediment quality. Overall, an integration of several methods using the weight of \nevidence is the most desirable approach for assessing the effects of contaminants \nassociated with sediment (Long and Morgan. 1990). Hazard evaluations integrating data \nfrom laboratory exposures, chemical analyses, and benthic community assessments \nprovide strong complementary evidence of the degree of pollution-induced degradation \nin aquatic communities (Chapman et at., 19Y2: Burton, lY91). \n1.2 I\u2019mgram Applicability \n1.2.1 The USEPA has authority under a variety of statutes to manage contaminated \nsediment. Until recently, the USEPA has not addressed sediment quality except in \nrelation to disposal of material removed during navigational dredging (Table 1.2). \nSoutherland et al. (1992) outlined four goals of a L\u2019SEPA management strategy for \ncontaminated sediments: (1) in-place sediment should he protected from contamination \nto ensure beneficial uses of surface waters. (2) protection of in-place sediment should be \nachieved through pollution prevention and source control, (3) in-place remediation \nshould be limited to locations where natural recovery will not occur in an acceptable \nperiod of time, and (4) consistent methods should be used to trigger regulatory decisions. \n1.2.2 The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the single most important law dealing with \nenvironmental quality of surface waters in the United States. The goal of the CW\u2019.4 is to \nrestore and maintain physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the nation\u2019s waters \n(Southerland et al., 1992). Federal and state monitoring programs traditionally have \nfocused on evaluating water column problems caused by point-source dischargers. \nDuring the next few years, the USEPA is developing a national inventory of \ncontaminated sediment sites. This inventory will be used to develop a biennial report to \nCongress on sediment quality in the United States required under the Water Resources \nDevelopment .4ct of 1992. The use of consistent sediment testing methods will provide \nhigh quality data needed for the national inventory and for regulatory program to \nprevent, remediate. and manage contaminated sediment (Southerland et al., 1992). \n1.2.3 The Office of Water (OW), the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP), the Office of \nPolhrtion Prevention and Toxic Substances (OPPT). the Office of Solid Waste (OSW\u2019). \nand the Office of Emergency and Remedial Response (OERR) are all committed to the \n3 \nTable 1.1 Sediment quality assessment procedures \n\\lethod type \n?+umerw Descrlptlve Cumblnatron Approach \nEquilibrium Partitioning * A sediment qualit) \\~alur for ;I \ngiven contaminant is detrrminrd \nby calculating the sediment \nconcentration of the contaminant \nthat corresponds to an interstitiul \nwater concentration e~~lli~illrllt tcb \nthe USEPA water qualit, \ncriterion for the contaminant. \nTissue Residues \nInterstitial Neater Toxicity * \nHenthic Community Structure * \n* Safe sediment concentrations II~\u2019 \nspecific chemicals are estahlishetl \nby determining the sediment \nchemical concentration that \nresults in acceptable tissue \nresidues. \n* Toxicity of interstitial water is \nquantified and identitication \nevaluation procedures are \napplied to identify and quantif! \nchemical components responsible \nfor sediment toxicity. \nEnvironmental degradation is \nmeasured by evaluating \nalterations in henthic rommunit> \nstructure. \nNote: \\Iodified from USEPA (1992~). \n4 Table 1.1 Sediment quality assessment procedures (continued) \nMethod -I\u2018?;pI? \nNumerrc llescnptrve Comblnatron .-\\ppro;Ic h \nWhole sediment Toxicity \nand Sediment Spiking * * 4 l\u2019rst w~anisms iire expc)wtl (41 \nsediments that ma> contain \nknown or unknown qu;rntitit+ rlt \npotentially toxic chrmical%. \\t \nthe end of a sptxitird time \nperiod. the respalnsr of the trrt \norganisms is rxamincd in rel;~tion \nto a specitird endpoint.

Agency-wide consistent testing is desirable because \nall GSEP.4 programs will use similar methods to evaluate whether a sediment postb.s 311 \necological or human health risk. and comparable data would be produced. It will al?;o \nprovide the basis for uniform cross-program decision-making within the I.SEP.4. Each \nprogram will. however retain the flexibility of deciding whether identified risks rroultl \ntrigger regulatory actions. \n1.2.4 Tiered testing should include a hierarchy of tests with the tests in each successive \ntier becoming progressively more rigorous, complex, and costly (Southerland et al. 1WZr. \nGuidance needs to be developed to explain how information within each tier would \ntrigger regulatory action. The guidance could be program specific. describing decisions \nbased on a weight of evidence approach, a pass-fail approach. or comparison to a \nreference site depending on statutory and regulatory requirements. There are now t\\\\tr \napproaches for tiered testing used by USEPA: (1) the Office of M\u2019ater-I..S. .4rm! (\u2018or-p3 \nof Engineers dredged material testing framework and 1.2) the OPP ecological risk \nassessment tiered testing framework. Tier 1 of the dredged material tesiing framework \nconsists of a review of existing chemical and biological data or an inventor? of near-h! \nsources. In Tier 2. chemical data are compared to water and sediment quality criteriit. \nTier 3 evaluations consist of acute toxicity and bioaccumulation testing. and a \ncomparison of the results to a reference area. Tier 4 studies consist of site-specific field \nstudies. The OPP testing framework consists of acute toxicity testing in Tier 1. followed \nby chronic (early life stage) toxicity testing in Tier 2 and further chronic tosiciQ\u2019 testing \n(full life cycle) in Tier 3. .A tiered testing framework has not yet been chosen for \nAgency-wide use, but some of the components have been identified to be standardized. \nThese components are toxicity tests, bioaccumulation tests, chemical criteria. and other \nmeasurements that may have ecological significance including benthic communit? \nstructure evaluation, colonization rate, and in situ sediment testing within a mesocosnl \n( L\u2019SEP.l, 1 YY2a). \n1.3 Scope and Application \n1.3.1 Procedures are described for testing estuarine and marine amphipod crustaceans \nin the laboratory to evaluate the toxicity of contaminants associated with whole \nsediments. Sediments may be collected from the field or spiked with compounds in the \nlaboratory. A toxicity method is outlined for four species of estuarine and marine \nsediment-burrowing amphipods found within United States coastal waters. The species \nare Ampelisca abdifu, a marine species that inhabits marine and mesohaline portions of \nthe Atlantic coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and San Francisco Bay: Eohuustorius esttrarirrs. 3 \nPacific coast estuarine species; Leptocheirus plumulosus, an Atlantic coast estuarine \nspecies: and Rhepoxynius abronius, a Pacific coast marine species. Generally, the \nmethod described may be applied to all four species, although acclimation procedures \nand some test conditions (i.e.. temperature and salinity) will be species-specific (Sections \n10 and 11). The toxicity test is conducted for 10 d in 1 L glass chambers containing 175 \nmL of sediment and 800 mL of overlying seawater. Exposure is static (i.e.. water is not \nrenewed), and the animals are not fed over the 10 d exposure period. The endpoint in \nthe toxicity test is survival. and reburial of surviving amphipods is an additional \n7 \nmeasurement that can be used as an endpoint. Procedures are described for use with \nsediments with pore water salinity ranging from A) \u201cif to fully marine. \n1.3.2 .Additional research and methods development are now in progress to: I 1) develop \nstandard chronic sediment toxicity tests (e.g.. 28-d exposures with Leptocheirus \npi~~rt~tclosus I. (2) develop standard sediment hioaccumulation tests (i.e.. 28-d exposures \nwith the bivalve .Vao~ma n~sufa and the polychaete Xereis G-ens 1 (Lee et al.. 1989). (3) \nrefine sediment spiking procedures, (4) refine sediment dilution procedures, (5) refine \nsediment Tosicity Identification Evaluation (TIE) procedures. and (6) produce additional \ndata on confirmation of responses in laboratory tests with natural populations of benthic \norganisms. This information will be described in future editions of the manual. \n1.3.3 This methods manual serves as a companion to the freshwater sediment testing \nmethod manual (I\u2018SEP.4, 1994a). \n1.3.1 Procedures described in this manual are based on the following documents: \nSwartz et al. (19851. DeW\u2019itt et al. (l!&Y), Scott and Redmond (1989). Schiekat et al. \n( 1992). AST\\l (1992). and Environment Canada (IYO2). This USEPA manual outlines \nspecific test methods for evaluating the toxicity of sediments with A. abdita, E. estuarius, \nL. plurnulosus. and R. abronius. While standard procedures are described in the \nmanual. further investigation of certain issues could aid in the interpretation of test \nresults. Some of these issues include the effect of shipping on organism sensitivity, \nadditional performance criteria for organism health. and confirmation of responses in \nlaborator! tests with natural benthos populations. \n1.3.5 General procedures described in this manual might be useful for conducting tests \nwith other estuarine or marine organisms (e.g.. Corophium spp., Grandidierella japnnica. \nLepidactylus dytiscus. Streblospio benedicti). although modifications may be necessary. \n.Iltering the procedures described in this manual may alter bioavaiiability and produce \nresults that are not directly comparable with results of acceptable procedures. \nComparison of results obtained using modified versions of these procedures might \nprovide useful information concerning new concepts and procedures for conducting \nsediment tests with aquatic organisms. If tests are conducted with methods different \nfrom those described in this manual. additional tests are required to determine \ncomparability of results. \n1.3.6 Jlethods have been described for culturing and testing indigenous species that may \nbe as sensitive or more sensitive than the species recommended in this manual. \nHowever, the CSEPA allows the use of indigenous species only where State regulations \nrequire their use or prohibit importation of the recommended species. Where state \nregulations prohibit the importation or use of the recommended test species, permission \nshould be requested from the appropriate regulatory agency before their using \nindigenous species. \n1.3.7 \\f\u2019here States have developed culturing and testing methods for indigenous species \nother than those recommended in the manual, data comparing the sensitivity of the \nsubstitute species and one or more of the recommended species must be obtained with \nsediments or reference toxicants, to ensure that the species selected iIre at least as \nhensitile and appropriate as the recommended species. \n1.3.8 Selection of Test Organisms \nI .3.X. 1 The choice of a test organism has a major influence on the relevance. success. \nand interpretation of a test. Test organism selection should be ba?;ed on both \nen~~ironmentA relevance and practical concerns ( DeFVitt et al.. 1YW S\\r artz. I WW 1. \nIdcall~~. a test organism should: ( 1) have a toxicological database demonstrating relative \nsensitivity to a range of contaminants of interest in sediment. (2) habe a database frjr \ninterlaboratory comparisons of procedures (e.g.. round-robin studies). (3) be in direct \ncontact I\\ ith sediment. (4) be readily available from culture or throug!l field c~)llection. \n(5) be easilv maintained in the laboratory, (6) be easily, identified. (7) be ecologically or \ncconon~icali~ important, (8) have a broad geographical distribution. be indigenous \n(either present or historical) to the site being evaluated. or hake a niche similar to \norganisms of concern ie.g.. similar feeding guild or behavior to the indigenous \norganisms), (9) be tolerant of a broad range of sediment ph)~icc.)-chenlicul characteristics \n(e.g.. grain sizej. and (10) be compatible with selected esposure methods and endpoints \n(.-ISTXI. iW3a). Jlethods utilizing selected organisms should also be I 11 I peer rebierred \n(e.g., journal articles. AST\\l guides) and ( 12) confirmed bfith responses with natural \npopulations of benthic organisms. \n1.3.8.2 Of these criteria (Table 1.3), a database demonstrating relative sensitivit!, to \ncontaminants. contact with sediment, ease of culture in the laborator!. or a\\ailabilit> for \nfield-collection, ease of handling in the laboratory, tolerance to t,ar!ing sediment \nphysic+chemical characteristics. and confirmation with responses with natural benthic \npopulations were the primary criteria used for selecting A. abdh. E. estuarius, \nL. plumulosus. and R. abnmius for the current edition of the manual. The species \nchosen for this method are intimately associated with sediment. due to their tube- \ndwelling or free-burrowing, and sediment ingesting nature. Amphipods hate been u>ed \nextensively to test the toxicity of marine, estuarine, and freshwater sediments (S~rartz et \nal., 1985; DeCVitt et al., 1YIW: Scott and Redmond, 1989: DeN\u2019itt et al.. 1902a: Schlekat \net al., 1992: .AST\\l. 1992). The selection of test species for this manual follo\\\\ed the \nconsensus of experts in the field of sediment toxicotogy who participated in a t+orkshc)p \nentitled \u201cTesting Issues for Freshwater and [Ilarine Sediments\u201d. The workshop was \nsponsored by t\u2018SEP.4 Office of Water. Office of Science and Technology,. and Offict~ of \nResearch and Development. and was held in Washington. D.C. from 16-18 September \n1992 tl\u2019SEP.4. lOY2a). Of the candidate species discussed at the workshop, A. abdifa. \nE. estuarius, L. piumulosus, and R. abronius best fulfilled the selection criteria. and \npresented the availability of a combination of one estuarine and one marine species each \nfor both the Atlantic (the estuarine L. plumulnsus and the marine .A. nbdifa) and Pacific \n(the estuarine E. estuarius and the marine R. abronius) coasts. .-1mpelisca nhdita is also \nnative to portions of the Gulf of Mexico. The existence of established .ASTJl methods \nfor each species (.AST%l. 1992) supported their selection. Jlarq other organisms that \nmight be appropriate for sediment testing do not now meet these selection criteria \nbecause little emphasis has been placed on developing standardized testing proc*edures \nfor benthic organisms. For example, a fifth species for which an ASTJl method is \na\\ aila hle. Grandi&erellcr japonica (.ASTJl. 1992 f, was not selected because workshop \nparticipants felt that the use of this species was not sufficiently broad to warrant \nstandardization of the method. Environment Canada (1992) has recommended the use \nof the following amphipod species for sediment toxicity testing: .-hphiporeia virginiana, \ni~oropltiutn volutator. Eohaustorius washingtonianus, Foxiphalus xixitneus, and \ni2ptocltriru.s pittguis. .A database similar to those available for A. abdita, E. esruarius, \n1.. pluttrulosus, and R. abronius must be debeloped in order for these and other \norganisms to he included in future editions of this manual. \n1.3.X.3 .An important consideration in the selection of specific species for test method \ndevelopment is the existence of information concerning relative sensitivity of the \norganisms both to single chemicals and complex mixtures. Several studies ha1.e \nevaluated the sensitivities of A. abdira, E. estuarius, L. plutnulosus, or R. abrottius. either \nrelative to one another. or to other commonly tested estuarine or marine species. For \nexample. the nensitivit!, of marine amphipods was compared to other species that were \nused in generating saltwater Water Quality Criteria. Seven amphipod genera. including \n-\\tnpelis~a abdita and Rhepoxynius abrmius. were among the test species used to generate \nAtwater \\\\\u2018ater Quality Criteria for 12 chemicals. Acute amphipod toxicity data from \n4-d water-only tests for each of the 12 chemicals was compared to data for (1) all other \nspecies. (2) other benthic species. and (3) other infaunal species.

Thus. amphipods are not uniquely sensitiv,e relative to all \nspecies. henthic species. or even infaunal species (D. Hansen, USEPA. Sarragansett, RI. \npt~r~~ual communication). Additional research may be warranted to develop tests using \nrpecies that are consistently more sensitive than amphipods, thereby offering protection \nto le5s sensitive groups. \n1.3.X.4 \\~\u2018illiams et al. I 1986) compared the sensitivity of the R. abronius 10-d whole \nsediment test. the oyster embryo (Crassostrea gigas) 48-h abnormality test, and the \nbacterium (Photobacterium phosphoreum) 1 -h luminescence inhibition test (i.e.. the \n\\licroto\\\u2019 test) to sediments collected from 16 contaminated sites in Commencement \n&I!, \\\\\u2018.\\. Rhepoqwius abronius were exposed to whole sediment. while the oyster and \nbacterium tests were conducted with sediment elutriates and extracts. respectfully. \n\\licrotos\u2019 was the most sensitive test. with 63% of the sites eliciting significant \ninhibition of luminescence. Significant mortality of R. abronius was observed in JOq of \ntest sediments, and oyster abnormality occurred in 35% of sediment elutriates. \nComplete ccmcordance (i.e., sediments that were either toxic or not-toxic in all three \ntests) was observed in 41% of the sediments. Possible sources for the lack of \nconcordance at other sites include interspecific differences in sensitivity among test \ncuganisms. heterogeneity in contaminant types associated with test sediments. and \ndifferences in routes of exposure inherent in each bioassay. These results highlight the \nimportance of using multiple assays when performing sediment assessments. \n1.3.8.5 Several studies have compared the sensitivity of combinations of the four \nnmphipods to sediment contaminants. For example, there are several comparisons \nbetween .A. abdira and R. abronius, between E. estuarius and R. abronius. and between \nA. abdita and L. plumulosus. There are fewer examples of direct comparisons between \nE. esfuarius and L. plumulosus, and no examples comparing L. pfumufosus and \nR. abronius. There is some overlap in relative sensitivity from comparison to \ncomparison within each species combination, which appears to indicate that all four \nspecies are within the same range of relative sensitivity to contaminated sediments. \n1.3.X.5.1 \\Vord et al. (1989) compared the sensitivity of A. abdi& and R. abronius to \ncontaminated sediments in a series of experiments. The experiments followed protocols \ndeveloped specifically for each species: thus, A. abdita was tested at 20\u00b0C. whereas \nR. abronius was tested at 15\u00b0C. Experiments were designed to compare the sensitivity of \nthe protocols rather than to provide a comparison of the response of the organism. \nSediments collected from Oakland Harbor, C.4, were used for the comparisons. Twenty\u2019- \nsix sediments were tested in one comparison, while 5 were tested in the other. Analysis \nof results using Kruskal Wallace rank sum test for both experiments demonstrated that \nR. abronius exhibited greater sensitivity to the sediments than A. abdila. Long and \nBuchman Cl989) also compared the sensitivity of A. abdira and R. abronius to sediments \nfrom Oakland Harbor. CA. They also determined that A. abdita showed less sensitivity \nthan R. abronius. but they also showed that A. abdita was less sensitive to sediment grain \nGze factors than R. abronius. \n12 \n1.3.8.5.2 DeWitt et al. il989) compared the sensitivity of E. estuarius and K. ubmrrius 10 \nsediment spiked with flouranthene and field-collected sediment from industrial \nwaterways in Puget Sound. WA, in 10-d tests, and to aqueous cadmium (CdCI,. in a 4-d \nwater-only test. The sensitivity of E. estuarius was from two (to flouranthene-spiked \nsediment) to seven (to one Puget Sound, W.A, sediment) times less sensitive than \nR. abronius in sediment tests, and ten times less sensitive to CdCI, in the water-only test. \nThese results are supported by the findings of Pastorak and Becker (1990) who found \nthe acute sensitivity of E. es&arks and R. abronius to be generally comparable to each \nother, and both were more sensitive than ,Veanthes (survival and biomass endpoints). \nPanoge (survival), and Dendraster (survival). \n1.3.8.5.3 Leptocheirus piumukosus was as sensitive as the freshwater amphipod H.wldla \nazteca to an artificially created gradient of sediment contamination when the latter ~1s \nacclimated to oligohaline salinity (i.e., 6 %O (McGee et al., 1993). DeW\u2019itt et al. I, I992h I \ncompared the sensitivity of L. plumulosus with three other amphipod species. two \nmolluscs. and one polychaete to highly contaminated sediment collected from Battimore \nHarbor, MD. that was serially diluted with clean sediment. Leptocheirus plurnuir~srrs I\\ BS \nmore sensitive than the amphipods Hyaielfa azreca and Lepidactylus d-ytiscus and \nexhibited equal sensitivity with E. estuarius. Comparisons using dilutions of sedimeut \ncollected from Black Rock Harbor. CT, show that A. abdifa shows greater sensitibit! \nthan L. plumufosus when the latter is tested at 20\u00b0C (SAIC. 1993a). However, \nL. pfumufosus is more sensitive at 25\u00b0C. the temperature at which chronic test methods \nwith this species are being developed (Dewitt. lY92a). than A. abdila at 2O\u2019c\u2019 (S.AIC. \n1993a). \n1.3.8.6 Limited comparative data is avaiIable for concurrent water-onl? exposures of 311 \nfour species in single-chemical tests. Studies that do exist generally show that no one \nspecies is consistently the most sensitive. \n1.3.8.6.1 The relative sensitivity of the four amphipod species to ammonia was \ndetermined in ten-d water only toxicity tests in order to aid interpretatiorr of result!, c)f \ntests on sediments where this toxicant is present (SAIC. 19!Uc). These tests were static- \nexposures that were generally conducted under conditions (e.g., salinity. photoperiod) \nsimilar to those used for standard 10-d sediment tests. Departures from standard \nconditions included the absence of sediment and a test temperature of 20L\u2019C for \ni.. plumufosus, rather than 25\u00b0C as dictated in this manual. Sensitivity to total ammonia \nincreased with increasing pH for all four species. The rank sensitivity was R. abronius -: \nA. abdita B E. estuarius > L. plumulosus. \n1.3.8.62 Cadmium chloride has been a common reference toxicant for all four species \nin 4-d exposures. Dewitt et al. (1992a) reports the rank sensitivity as R. abronius > \nA. abditu > L. plumufosus > E. estuarius at a common temperature and salinity of 15 (\u2018 \nand 28 %;r. A series of 4-d exposures to cadmium that were conducted at species-specific \ntemperatures and salinities showed the following rank sensitivity: A. ubdira = \nL. plumuiosus = R. abronius > E. estuarius (SAIC. I993a; SAIC, l\u2019)V3b: and S.4 I(\u2018. \nlY93c). \n13 \n1.3M5.3 Relative species sensitivity frequently varies among contaminants: \nconsequently. a battery of tests including organisms representing different trophic levels \nmay be needed to assess sediment quality (Craig. 1984: Williams et al., 1YMa: Long et \nal.. 1990: Ingersoll et al.. 1YA): Burton and lngersoll. 1994). For example. Reish (1988) \nreported the relative toxicit, of six metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, \nmercury. and zinc) to crustaceans. polychaetes. pelecypods, and fishes and concluded \nthat no one species or group of test organisms was the most sensitive to all of the metals. \n1.3.8.7 The sensitivity of an organism is related to route of exposure and biochemical \nresponse to contaminants. Sediment-dwelling organisms can receive exposure via from \nthree primat-! sources: interstitial water. sediment particles, and overlying water. Food \ntype, feeding rate. assimilation efficiency. and clearance rate will control the dose of \ncontaminants from sediment. Benthic invertebrates often selectively consume different \nparticle sizes (Harkey et al.. 1994) or particles with higher organic carbon \nconcentrations H hich may have higher contaminant concentrations. Grazers and other \ncollector-gatherers that feed on aufwuchs and detritus may receive most of their body \nburden directI> from materials attached to sediment or from actual sediment ingestion. \nIn some amphipods (Landrum, 1089) and clams (Boese et al., lY!N) uptake through the \ngut can esceed uptake across the gills for certain hydrophobic compounds. Organisms \nin direct contact with sediment may alscJ accumulate contaminants by direct adsorption \nto the hod? wall or b> absorption through the integument (Knezovich et al., 1987). \n1.3.8.8 Despite the potential complexities in estimating the dose that an animal receives \nfrom sediment. the toxicity and bioaccumulation of many contaminants in sediment such \nas Kepone\u201d. flouranthene. organochlorines, and metals have been correlated with either \nthe concentration of these chemicals in interstitial water or in the case of non-ionic \norganic chemicals. concentrations in sediment on an organic carbon normalized basis (Di \nToro et al.. 1990: Di Toro et al., 1991). The relative importance of whole sediment and \ninterstitial water routes of exposure depends on the test organism and the specific \ncontaminant ( Knezovich et al., 1987). Because henthic communities contain a diversity \nof organisms, many combinations of exposure routes may be important. Therefore, \nbehavior and feeding habits of a test organism can influence its ability to accumulate \ncontaminants from sediment and should be considered when selecting test organisms for \nsediment testing. \n1.3.8.9 The use of .4. abdizu, E. estuarius, and R. abronius in laboratory toxicity studies \nhas been field validated with natural populations of benthic organisms (Swartz et al.. \n1994 for E estuarius: Swartz et al., I%2 for R. abronius).

The threshold for 10-d sediment toxicity in laboratory studies was about \n3041 ug DDT (+metahoIites,t/g organic carbon.

Test sediments may be collected from estuarine or marine environments \nor spiked with compounds in the laboratory. A single test method is outlined that may \nbe used with any of four amphipod species. including Ampefiscu abdita, Eohaustorius \nestuarius, Leptocheirus plumulosus, and Rhepoxynius abronius. The toxicity test is \nconducted for 10 d in I L glass chambers containing 175 mL of sediment and 800 rnL of \noverlying water. Overlying water is not renewed, and test organisms are not fed during \nthe toxicity tests. Temperature and salinity of overlying water. and choice of control \nsediment (i.e.. negative control). are species-specific. The choice of reference sediment \nmay he species-specific under certain applications. The endpoint in the toxicity test is \nsurvival. and reburial of surviving amphipods is an additional measurement that can be \nused as an endpoint. Procedures are described for use with sediments from oligohaline \nto fully marine environments. \n2.1.2 Experimental Design. The following section is a general summary of experimental \ndesign. See Section 12 for additional detail. \n2.1.2.1 Control and Reference Sediment. \n2.1.2.1.1 Sediment tests include a control sediment (sometimes called a negative control). \nA control sediment is a sediment that is essentially free of contaminants and is used \nroutinely to assess the acceptability of a test and is not necessarily collected near the site \nof concern. Any contaminants in control sediment are thought to originate from the \nglobal spread of pollutants and do not reflect any substantial input from local or non- \npoint sources (Lee et al., 1994). A control sediment provides a measure of test \nacceptability. evidence of test organism health, and a basis for interpreting data obtained \nfrom the test sediments. A reference sediment is collected near an area of concern and \nis used to assess sediment conditions exclusive of material(s) of interest. Testing a \nreference sediment provides a site-specific basis for evaluating toxicity. \n2.1.2.1.2 Natural geomorphological and physico-chemical characteristics such as \nsediment texture may influence the response of test organisms (DeWitt et al.. 1988). The \nphysico-chemical characteristics of test sediment must be within the tolerance limits of \nthe test organism. Ideally. the limits of a test organism should be determined in \nadvance: however. controls for factors including grain size and organic carbon can be \nevaluated if the limits are exceeded in a test sediment. See Section 10.1 for tolerance \nlimits of each species for physico-chemical characteristics. If the physico-chemical \ncharacteristics; of a test sediment exceed the tolerance limits of the test organism. it \n16 \nmay be desirable to include a control sediment that encompasses those characteristics; or \nto choose a test organism with tolerance limits that are not exceeded by the physico- \nchemical characteristics in question. The effects of some sediment characteristics on the \nresults of sediment tests may be able to be addressed with regression equations (DeWitt \net al.. 1988: Ankley et al., 1993). \n2.1.2.2 The experimental design depends on the purpose of the study. Variables that \nneed to be considered include the number and type of control sediments. the number of \ntreatments and replicates, and water quality characteristics. For instance. the purpose \nof the study might be to determine a specific endpoint such as an LC50 and may include \na control sediment, a positive control. and several concentrations of sediment spiked \nwith a chemical. A useful summary of field sampling design is presented by Green \n( 1979). See Section 12 for additional guidance on experimental design and statistics. \n2.1.2.3 If the purpose of the study is to conduct a reconnaissance field survey to identify \ncontaminated sites for further investigation. the experimental design might include only \none sample from each site to allow for maximum spatial coverage. The lack of \nreplication at a site usually precludes statistical comparisons (e.g.. ANOVA). but these \nsurveys can be used to identify contaminated sites for further study or may be evaluated \nusing regression techniques (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981: Steel and Torrie. 1980). \n2.1.2.4 In other instances, the purpose of the study might be to conduct a quantitative \nsediment survey to determine statistically significant differences between effects among \ncontrol and test sediments from several sites. The number of replicates per site should \nbe based on the need for sensitivity or power (Section 12). In a quantitative survey. \nreplicates (separate samples from different grabs collected at the same site) would need \nto be taken at each site. Chemical and physical characteristics of each of these grabs \nwould be required for sediment testing. Separate subsamples might be used to \ndetermine within-sample variability or to compare test procedures (e.g.. comparative \nsensitivity among test organisms), but these subsamples cannot be considered to be true \nfield replicates for statistical comparisons among sites (ASTM. 1993b). \n2.1.2.5 Sediments often exhibit high spatial and temporal variability (Stemmer et al.. \n1990a). Therefore, replicate samples may need to be collected to determine variance in \nsediment characteristics. Sediment should be collected with as little disruption as \npossible: however, subsampling, compositing, or homogenization of sediment samples \nmay be necessary for some experimental designs. \n2.1.2.6 Site locations might be distributed along a known pollution gradient. in relation \nto the boundary of a disposal site. or at sites identified as being contaminated in a \nreconnaissance survey. Both spatial and temporal comparisons can be made. In pre- \ndredging studies, a sampling design can be prepared to assess the contamination of \nsamples representative of the project area to be dredged. Such a design should include \nsubsampling cores taken to the project depth. \n2.1.2.7 The primary focus of the physical and experimental test design. and statistical \nanalysis of the data. is the experimental unit. The experimental unit is defined as the \n17 \nsmallest physical entity to which treatments can be independently assigned (Steel and \nTorrie. I!MO) and to which air exchange between test chambers are kept to a minimum. \nIs the number of test chambers per treatment increases, the number of degrees of \nfreedom increases. and. therefore, the width of the confidence interval on a point \ne\\tirnate. such as an LC50, decreases. and the power of a significance test increases \n(Section 12). Because of factors that might affect results within test chambers and \nresults of a test, all test chambers should be treated as similarly as possible. Treatments \nshould be randomly assigned to individual test chamber locations. Assignment of test \norganisms to test chambers should be non-biased. \n2.2 Types of Tests \n2.2. I .A toxicity method is outlined for four species of estuarine and marine amphipod, \nincluding .Ampelisca abdita, Eohaustorius estuarius, Leptucheirus plumulosus, and \nKhupox-vnius abronius (Section 11). The manual describes procedures for testing \nsediments from oligohaline to fully marine environments. \n2.3 Test Endpoints \n2.3.1 The primary endpoint measured in the toxicity test is survival. Reburial of \nsurbibing amphipods in control sediment is an additional measurement that can be used \nas an endpoint. Behavior of test organisms should be qualitatively observed daily in all \ntests (e.g., avoidance of sediment). \nSection 3 \nDefinitions \n3.1 Terms \nThe following terms were defined in Lee (1980), SRC (1989). USEPA (1989b USEPA- \nUSCOE (1991). USEPA-USCOE (1994), Lee et al. (1994). ASTM (1994a). or ASTM. \n(1993b). \n3.1.1 Technical Terms \n3.1.1.1 Sediment. Particulate material that usually lies below water. Formulated \nparticulate material that is intended to lie below water in a test. \n3.1.1.2 Contaminated sediment. Sediment containing chemical substances at \nconcentrations that pose a known or suspected threat to environmental or human health. \n3.1.1.3 Whole sediment. Sediment and associated pore water which have had minimal \nmanipulation. The term bulk sediment has been used synonymously with whole \nsediment. \n3.1.1.3 Control sediment. A sediment that is essentially free of contaminants and is used \nroutinely to assess the acceptability of a test. Any contaminants in control sediment may \noriginate from the global spread of pollutants and does not reflect any substantial input \nfrom local or non-point sources. Comparing test sediments to control sediments is a \nmeasure of the toxicity of a test sediment beyond inevitable background contamination. \n3.1.1.5 Reference sediment. A whole sediment near an area of concern used to assess \nsediment conditions exclusive of material(s) of interest. The reference sediment may be \nused as an indicator of localized sediment conditions exclusive of the specific pollutant \ninput of concern. Such sediment would be collected near the site of concern and would \nrepresent the background conditions resulting from any localized pollutant inputs as \nwell as global pollutant input. This is the manner in which reference sediment is used in \ndredge material evaluations. \n3.1.1.6 Interstitial water or pore water. Water occupying space between sediment or soil \nparticles. \n3.1.1.7 Spiked sediment. A sediment to which a material has been added for \nexperimental purposes. \n3.1.1.8 Reference-toxicity test. A test conducted in conjunction with sediment tests to \ndetermine possible changes in condition of the test organisms. Deviations outside an \nestablished normal range indicate a change in the condition of the test organism \npopulation. Reference-toxicity tests are most often performed in the absence of \nsediment. \n19 \n3.11.9 Clean. Denotes a sediment or water that does not contain concentrations of test \nmaterials which cause apparent stress to the test organisms or reduce their survival. \n3.1.1.10 Overlying water. The water placed over sediment in a test chamber during a \ntest. \n3.1.1.11 Concentration. The ratio of weight or volume of test material(s) to the weight \nor volume of sediment. \n3.1.1.12 No observable Effect Concentration (NOEC). The highest concentration of a \ntoxicant to which organisms are exposed in a test that causes no observable adverse \neffect on the test organisms (i.e., the highest concentration of a toxicant in which the \nvalue for the observed response is not statistically significant different from the \ncontrols). \n3.1.1.13 Lowest observable Effect Concentration (LOEC). The lowest concentration of a \ntoxicant to which organisms are exposed in a test which causes an adverse effect on the \ntest organisms (i.e.. where the value for the observed response is statistically significant \ndifferent from the controls). \n3.1.1.14 Lethal concentration (LC). The toxicant concentration that would cause death in \na given percent of the test population. Identical to EC when the observable adverse \neffect is death. For example, the LC50 is the concentration of toxicant that would cause \ndeath in 50% of the test population. \n3.1.1.15 Effect concentration (EC). The toxicant concentration that would cause an \neffect in a given percent of the test population. Identical to LC when the observable \nadverse effect is death. For example, the EC50 is the concentration of toxicant that \nwould cause death in 50% of the test population. \n3.1.1.16 Inhibition concentration (IC). The toxicant concentration that would cause a \ngiven percent reduction in a non-quantal measurement for the test population. For \nexample. the IC25 is the concentration of toxicant that would cause a 25% reduction in \ngrowth for the test population and the IC50 is the concentration of toxicant that would \ncause a 50% reduction. \n3.1.2 Grammatical Terms \n3.1.2.1 The words \u201cmust\u201d. \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201ccan\u201d, and \u201cmight\u201d have very specific \nmeanings in this manual. \n3.1.2.2 \u201cMust\u201d is used to express an absolute requirement, that is, to state that a test \nought to be designed to satisfy the specified conditions. unless the purpose of the test \nrequires a different design. \u201cMust\u201d is only used in connection with the factors that \ndirectly relate to the acceptability of a test. \n20 \n3.1.2.3 \u201cShould\u201d is used to state that the specified condition is recommended and ought \nto be met if possible. Although a violation of one \u201cshould\u201d is rarely a serious matter, \nviolation of several will often render the results questionable. \n3.1.2.4 Terms such as \u201cis desirable.\u201d is often desirable,\u201d and \u201cmight be desirable\u201d are \nused in connection with less important factors. \n3.1.2.5 \u201cMay\u201d is used to mean \u201cis (are) allowed to.\u201d \u201ccan\u201d is used to mean \u201cis (are) \nable to.\u201d and \u201cmight\u201d is used to mean \u201ccould possibly.\u201d Thus, the classic distinction \nbetween \u201cmay\u201d and \u201ccan\u201d is preserved. and \u201cmight\u201d is never used as a synonym for \neither \u201cmay\u201d or \u201ccan.\u201d \n21 \nSection 4 \nInterferences \n4.1 General Introduction \n41.1 Interferences are characteristics of a sediment or sediment test system that can \npotentially affect test organism survival aside from those related to sediment-associated \ncontaminants. These interferences can potentially confound interpretation of test results \nin two ways: (1) toxicity is observed in the test when contamination is not present, or \nthere is more toxicity than expected: and (2) no toxicity is observed when contaminants \nare present at elevated concentrations, or there is less toxicity than expected. \n41.2 There are three categories of interfering factors: those characteristics of \nsediments affecting survival independent of chemical concentration (i.e., non- \ncontaminant factors); changes in chemical bioavailability as a function of sediment \nmanipulation or storage; and the presence of indigenous organisms. Although test \nprocedures and test organism selection criteria were developed to minimize these \ninterferences. this section describes the nature of these interferences. \n4.1.3 Because of the heterogeneity of natural sediments, extrapolation from laboratory \nstudies to the field can sometimes be difficult (Table 4.1: Burton. 1991). Sediment \ncollection, handling, and storage may alter bioavailability and concentration by changing \nthe physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of the sediment. Maintaining the \nintegrity of a field-collected sediment during removal, transport. mixing, storage. and \ntesting is extremely difficult and may complicate the interpretation of effects. Direct \ncomparisons of organisms exposed in the laboratory and in the field would be useful to \nverify laboratory results. However. spiked sediment may not be representative of \ncontaminated sediment in the field. Mixing time (Stemmer et al., 199Oa) and aging \n(Word et al., 1987; Landrum, 1989; Landrum and Faust, 1992) of spiked sediment can \naffect responses of organisms. \n4.1.3.1 Laboratory sediment testing with field-collected sediments may be useful in \nestimating cumulative effects and interactions of multiple contaminants in a sample. \nTests with field samples usually cannot discriminate between effects of individual \nchemicals. Most sediment samples contain a complex matrix of inorganic and organic \ncontaminants with many unidentified compounds. The use of Toxicity Identification \nEvaluations (TIE) in conjunction with sediment tests with spiked chemicals may provide \nevidence of causal relationships and can be applied to many chemicals of concern \n(Ankley and Thomas, 1992; Adams et al., 1985). Sediment spiking can also be used to \ninvestigate additive, antagonistic, or synergistic effects of specific contaminant mixtures \nin a sediment sample (Swartz et al.. 1988). \n41.4 Methods which measure sublethal effects are either not available or have not \nbeen routinely used to evaluate sediment toxicity (Craig, 1984: Dillon and Gibson. 1986: \nIngersoll and Nelson, 1990; Ingersoll, 1991: Burton et al.. 1992). Most assessments of \ncontaminated sediment rely on short-term lethality testing methods (e.g., [ 10d: USEPA- \n22 \nTable 4.1 Advantages and disadvantages for use of sediment tests \nAdvantages \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n. Measure bioavailable fraction of contaminant(s). \nProvide a direct measure of benthic effects, assuming no field adaptation or \namelioration of effects. \nLimited special equipment is required. \nMethods are rapid and inexpensive. \nLegal and scientific precedence exists for use; ASTM standard guides are available. \nMeasure unique information relative to chemical analyses or benthic community \nanalyses. \nTests with spiked chemicals provide data on cause-effect relationships. \nSediment-toxicity tests can be applied to all chemicals of concern. \nTests applied to field samples reflect cumulative effects of contaminants and \ncontaminant interactions. \nToxicity tests are amenable to confirmation with natural benthos populations. \nDisadvantages \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 Sediment collection, handling, and storage may alter bioavailability. \nSpiked sediment may not be representative of field contaminated sediment. \nNatural geochemical characteristics of sediment may affect the response of test \norganisms. \nIndigenous animals may be present in field-collected sediments. \nRoute of exposure may be uncertain and data generated in sediment toxicity tests \nmay be difficult to interpret if factors controlling the bioavailability of \ncontaminants in sediment are unknown. \nTests applied to field samples may not discriminate effects of individual chemicals. \nFew comparisons have been made of methods or species. \nOnly a few chronic methods for measuring sublethal effects have been developed or \nextensively evaluated. \nLaboratory tests have inherent limitations in predicting ecological effects. \nNote: Modified from Swartz (1989). \n23 \nL.SCOE. 1977; l\u2018SEPA-CSCOE. 1991). Short-term lethality tests are useful in \nidentifying \u201chot spots\u201d of sediment contamination, but may not be sensitive enough to \nevaluate moderately contaminated areas. However, sediment quality assessments using \nsublethal responses of benthic organisms such as effects on growth and reproduction \nhave been used to successfully evaluate moderately contaminated areas (Scott. 1089). \n.Idditional methods development of chronic sediment testing procedures and culturing of \ninfaunal organisms with a variety of feeding habits including suspension and deposit \nfeeders is needed. \n1.1.5 Despite the interferences discussed in this section. existing sediment testing \nmethods can be used to provide a rapid and direct measure of effects of contaminants \non benthic communities. Laboratory tests with field-collected sediment can also be used \nto determine temporal, horizontal, or vertical distribution of contaminants in sediment. \n\\lost tests can be completed within two to four weeks. Legal and scientific precedents \nexist for use of toxicity and bioaccumulation tests in regulatory decision-making (e.g., \n1,\u2018SEP.A. 1986a). Furthermore, sediment tests with complex contaminant mixtures are \nimportant tools for making decisions about the extent of remedial action for \ncontaminated aquatic sites and for evaluating the success of remediation activities. \n4.2 Non-Contaminant Factors \n4.2.1 Results of sediment tests can be used to predict effects that may occur with \naquatic organisms in the field as a result of exposure under comparable conditions. Yet \nmotile organisms might avoid exposure in the field. Photoinduced toxicity caused by \nultraviolet tL!V) light, may be important for some compounds associated with sediment \n(e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs): Davenport and Spacie, 1901: Ankley et \nal.. 1994b). Fluorescent light does not contain L\\\u2019 light, but natural sunlight does. \nLighting can therefore affect toxicological responses and is an important experimental \nvariable for photoactivated chemicals. However, lighting typically used to conduct \nlaboratory tests does not include the appropriate spectrum of ultraviolet radiation to \nphotoactivate compounds (Oris and Giesy. 1985) and thus laboratory tests may not \naccount for toxicity expressed by this mode of action. \n4.2.2 There are a number of non-contaminant factors that may influence amphipod \nsurvival in these tests. The most important and variable factors include sediment \nparticle size. pore water salinity, and pore water ammonia. The physico-chemical \nproperties of each test sediment must be within the tolerance limits of the test organism. \nTolerance limits of the four amphipod species described in this manual for the factors \nlisted above are well defined and are presented in Section 11.4 and summarized in \nTable 11.4. If a particular sediment characteristic exceeds the tolerance of the proposed \ntest species. another, more appropriate species may be used or control samples \n(treatments) for exceeded factors may be included in the test design. The effects of \nsediment characteristics can also be extrapolated with regression equations (Dewitt et \nal.. I988; Ankley et al., 1994) that estimate the proportion of toxicity that may be due to \nthe non-contaminant factor alone. \n24 \n4.3 Changes in Bioavailabiiity \n43.1 Sediment toxicity tests are meant to serve as an indicator of contaminant-related \ntoxicity that might be expected under field or natural conditions. Although the tests are \nnot designed to simulate natural conditions. there is concern that contaminant \navailability in laboratory toxicity test is different from \\vhat it is representative of in- \nplace sediments in the field. \nJ.3.2 Sediment collection. handling. and storage may alter contaminant bioavailabifity \nand concentration by changing the physical. Aemical. or biological characteristics of the \nsediment. These manipulation processes are generally tfrougbt to increase acailabihty of \norganic compounds because of disruption of the equilibrium with organic carbon in the \npore water per particle system. Similarly, oxidation of anaerobic sediments increases \nthe availability of certain metals (Di Toro et al.. 1WlL Recause the availability of \ncontaminants may be a function of the degree of manipulation. this manual recommends \nthat handling, storage. and preparation of the sediment for actual testings be as \nconsistent as possible. Although very disruptive of natural sediment phy,sical features, \nall test sediments should be press-sieved sometime before testing and re-homogenized \nimmediately before introduction to the test chambers if warranted (See Section 8.3.1). \nPress-sieving is performed primarily to remove predatory organisms. large debris, or \norganisms taxonomicahy similar to the test species. Certain I\u2019SEPA program offices \nmay recommend that sediments should not be press-sieved. ,\\lso. it may not be \nnecessary to press-sieve sediments if previous experience has demonstrated the absence \nof potential interferences. including predatory or competitive organisms or large debris, \nor if large debris or predators can be removed with forceps or other suitable tools. The \npresence of an abundance of amphipods that are tnsonomicalty similar to the test species \nshould prompt press-sieving. This is particularly true if endemic Ampeliscidae are \npresent and A. abditu is the test species because it may he difficult to remove all of the \nresident amphipods from their tubes. If sediments must be sieved, it may be desirable to \nperform select analyses (e.g., pore-water metals or DOC. AVS. TOC) on samples before \nand after sieving to document the influence of sieving on sediment chemistry. \n43.3 Testing sediments at temperatures different from that in the field might affect \ncontaminant solubility. partitioning coefficients. or other physical and chemical \ncharacteristics. Interaction between sediment and overlying water and the ratio of \nsediment to overlying water may influence bioavailability (Stemmer et al.. l9OOb~. \n43.4 Depletion of aqueous and sediment-sorbed contaminants resulting from uptake by \nan organism or test chamber may also influence availability. In most cases. the \norganism is a minor sink for contaminants relative to the sediment. Howev,er. within the \nburrow of an organism, sediment desorption kinetics may limit uptake rates. \\Vithin \nminutes to hours. a major portion of the total chemical may be inaccessible to the \norganisms because of depletion of available residues. The desorption of a particular \ncompound from sediment may range from easily reversible (labile; within minutes) to \nirreversible t non-labile: within days or months: Karickhoff and Jlorris, 19XSl. Inter- \nparticle diffusion or advection and the quality and quantity of sediment organic carbon \ncan also affect sorption kinetics. \n-1.3.5 The route of exposure may be uncertain and data from sediment tests may be \ndifficult to interpret if factors controlling the bioavailability of contaminants in sediment \nare unknown. Bulk-sediment chemical concentrations may be normalized to factors \nother than dry weight. For example, concentrations of non-ionic organic compounds \nmight be normalized to sediment organic-carbon content !CSEP.A, 1992~) and certain \nmetals normalized to acid volatile sulfides (Di Toro et al., 1990). Even with the \nappropriate normalizing factors, determination of toxic effects from ingestion of \nsediment or from dissolved chemicals ill the interstitial water can still be difficult \n(Lamberson and Swartz, 1988). \n1.3.6 Salinity of the overlying water is an additional factor that can affect the \nbioavailability of metals. Some metals (e.g., cadmium) are more bioavailable at lower \nsalinities. Therefore, if a sediment sample from a low salinity location is tested with \noverlying waters of high salinity, there is the potential that metal toxicity may be \nreduced. The suite of species provided in this manual allow these tests to be conducted \nover the range of pore water salinities routinely encountered in fiefd-collected sediments \nfrom North American estuarine and marine environments. \n4.4 Presence of lrdigenous Organisms \n4.4.1 Indigenous organisms may be present in field-collected sediments. An abundance \nin the sediment sample of the test organism, or organisms taxonomically similar to the \ntest organism. may make interpretation of treatment effects difficult. The presence of \npredatory organisms can also adversely affect test organism survival. For example, \nRedmond and Scott (1989) showed that the polychaete Nephtys incisa will consume \nArnpefisca abditu under toxicity test conditions. Previous investigators have inhibited the \nbiological activity of sediment with sieving, heat, mercuric chloride, antibiotics, or \ngamma irradiation (Day et al., 1992). Although further research is needed to determine \neffects on contaminant bioavailability from treating sediment to remove or destroy \nindigenous organisms, estuarine and marine sediments must be press-sieved before the \nstart of a sediment toxicity test if the presence of predatory organisms is suspected (See \nSection 8.3.1.1). \n26 \nSection 5 \nHealth, Safety, and Waste Management \n5.1 General Precautions \n51.1 Development and maintenance of an effective health and safety program in the \nlaboratory requires an ongoing commitment by laboratory, management and includes: \n(1) the appointment of a laboratory health and safety officer with the responsibility and \nauthority to develop and maintain a safety program. (2) the preparation of a formal \nwritten, health and safety plan, which is provided to each laboratory staff member. (3) \nan ongoing training program on laboratory safety. and (4) regular safety inspections. \n51.2 This manual addresses procedures which may involve hazardous materials. \noperations, and equipment, and it does not purport to address all of the safety problems \nassociated with their use. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate \nsafety and health practices, and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations \nbefore use. While some safety considerations are included in the manual. it is beyond \nthe scope of the manual to encompass all safety requirements necessary to conduct \nsediment tests. \n5.1.3 Collection and use of sediments may involve substantial risks to personal safety \nand health. Contaminants in field-collected sediment may include carcinogens. \nmutagens. and other potentially toxic compounds. Inasmuch as sediment testing is often \nbegun before chemical analyses can be completed. worker contact with sediment needs \nto be minimized by: (1) using gloves, laboratory coats. safety glasses. face shields. and \nrespirators as appropriate, (2) manipulating sediments under a ventilated hood or in an \nenclosed glove box, and (3) enclosing and ventilating the exposure system. Personnel \ncollecting sediment samples and conducting tests should take all safety precautions \nnecessary for the prevention of bodily injury and illness which might result from \ningestion or invasion of infectious agents. inhalation or absorption of corrosive or toxic \nsubstances through skin contact, and asphyxiation because of tack of oxygen or presence \nof noxious gases. \n5.1.3 Before sample collection and laboratory work. personnel should determine that all \nrequired safety equipment and materials have been obtained and are in good condition. \n5.2 Safety Equipment \n5.2.1 Personal Safety Gear \n5.2.1.1 Personnel should use safety equipment. such as rubber aprons, laboratory costs. \nrespirators. gloves. safety glasses, face shields. hard hats, and safety shoes as \nappropriate. The degree of protection should vary according to the level contamination \nassociated with the test sediments. Generally. a higher degree of coverage should be \nadopted in all aspects of testing sediments that may harbor hazardous levels of \n27 \ncompounds. Coverage for testing control or moderately contaminated sediment does not \nhave to be as stringent. \n5.22 Laboratory Safety Equipment \n5.2.2.1 Each laboratory should be provided with safety equipment such as first aid kits. \nfire extinguishers, fire blankets. emergency showers. and eye fountains. \n5.2.2.2 All laboratories should be equipped with a telephone to enable personnel to \nsummon help in case of emergency. \n5.3 General Laboratory and Field Operations \n5.3.1 Laboratory personnel should be trained in proper practices for handling and using \nchemicals that are encountered during the procedures described in this manual. \nRoutinely encountered chemicals include acids and organic solvents. Special handling \nand precautionary guidance in Material Safety Data Sheets should be followed for \nreagents and other chemicals purchased from supply houses. All containers should be \nadequately labeled to indicate their contents. \n53.2 Work with some sediments may require compliance with rules pertaining to the \nhandling of hazardous materials. Personnel collecting samples and performing tests \nshould not work alone. \n5.3.3 It is advisable to wash exposed parts of the body with bactericidal soap and water \nimmediately after collecting or manipulating sediment samples. \n5.3.4 Strong acids and volatile organic solvents should be used in a fume hood or under \nan exhaust canopy over the work area. \n5.3.5 An acidic solution should not be mixed with a hypochlorite solution because \nhazardous fumes might be produced. \n5.3.6 To prepare dilute acid solutions. concentrated acid should be added to water. not \nvice versa. Opening a bottle of concentrated acid and adding concentrated acid to water \nshould be performed only in a fume hood. \n5.3.7 Use of ground-fault systems and leak detectors is strongly recommended to help \nprevent electrical shocks. Electrical equipment or extension cords not bearing the \napproval of Underwriter Laboratories should not be used. Ground-fault interrupters \nshould be installed in all \u201cwet\u201d laboratories where electrical equipment is used. \n53.8 All containers should be adequately labeled to identify their contents. \n5.3.9 Good housekeeping contributes to safety and reliable results. \n28 5.4 Disease Prevention \n5.4.1 Personnel handling samples which are known or suspected to contain human \nwastes should be given the opportunity to be immunized against hepatitis B, tetanus, \ntyphoid fever, and polio. \n5.5 Safety Manuals \n5.5.1 For further guidance on safe practices when handling sediment samples and \nconducting toxicity tests. check with the permittee and consult general industrial safety \nmanuals including USEPA ( lYS6b) and Walters and .Jameson (1984). \n5.6 Pollution Prevention, Waste Management, and Sample Disposal \n5.6.1 It is the laboratory\u2019s responsibility to comply with the federal. state and local \nregulations governing the waste management. particularly hazardous waste identification \nrules and land disposal restrictions, and to protect the air, water and land by \nminimizing and controlling all releases from fume hods and bench operations. Also, \ncompliance is require with any sewage discharge permits and regulations. For further \ninformation on waste management. consult \u201cThe Waste \\lanagement %lanual for \nLaboratory Personnel\u201d available from the American Chemical Society\u2019s Department of \nGovernment Relations and Science Policy, 1 I55 16th Street N.W., Washington, D.C. \n20036. \n5.6.2 Guidelines for the handling and disposal of hazardous materials should be strictl, \nfollowed. The Federal Government has published regulations for the management of \nhazardous waste and has given the States the option of either adopting those regulations \nor developing their own. If States develop their own regulations. they are required to be \nat least as stringent as the Federal regulations. .As a handler of hazardous materials. it \nis your responsibility to know and comply with the pertinent regulations applicable in \nthe State in which you are operating. Refer to the Bureau of National .Affairs, Inc. \n(19X6) for the citations of the Federal requirements. \n29 \nSection 6 \nFacilities, Equipment, and Supplies \n6.1 General \n6.1.1 Before a sediment test is conducted in any test facility. it is desirable to conduct a \n\u201cnon-toxicant\u201d test with each potential test species. in which all test chambers contain a \ncontrol sediment (sometimes called the negative control), and clean overlying water for \neach amphipod species to be tested. Survival of the test organism will demonstrate \nwhether facilities. water, control sediment. and handling techniques are adequate to \nachieve acceptable species-specific control survival. Evaluations may also be conducted \nof the magnitude of the within- and between-chamber variance in a test. \n6.2 Facilities \n6.2.1 The facility should include separate areas for culturing and testing to reduce the \npossibility of contamination by test materials and other substances, especially volatile \ncompounds. Holding, acclimation. and culture chambers should not be in a room in \nwhich sediment tests are conducted. stock solutions or where sediments are prepared. or \nequipment is cleaned. Test chambers may be placed in a temperature controlled \nrecirculating water bath, environmental chamber. or equivalent facility with \ntemperature control. Enclosure of the test systems is desirable to provide ventilation \nduring tests to limit exposure of laboratory personnel to volatile substances. \n6.2.2 Light of the quality and illuminance normally obtained in the laboratory is \nadequate (about 500 to 1000 lux using wide-spectrum fluorescent lights: e.g., cool-white \nor day-light) for culturing and testing. Lux is the unit selected for reporting luminance \nin this manual. Multiply units of lux by 0.093 to convert to units of foot candles. \nMultiply units of lux by 6.91 x 10-3 to convert to units of \u00b5E/m-/s1 (assuming an average \nwavelength of 550 nm (\u00b5mol-2 s-1 = W m x l (nm) x 8.36 x 10-3)) (ASTM. 1994b). \nLuminance should be measured at the surface of the water. illumination should be \nuniform and must be continuous throughout holding, acclimation, and the test period. \nContinuous overhead lighting has been previously demonstrated to inhibit nocturnal \nemergence of amphipods, thus maximizing exposure to test sediments. A 16:8 light:dark \nphotoperiod should be used for culturing L. plumulosus (Section 10.4.8) and for holding \nand acclimating A. abdita in the laboratory before testing (Section 10.4.5). This \nphotoperiod can be achieved using automatic timers. \n6.2.3 During rearing, holding. and testing, test organisms should be shielded from \nexternal disturbances such as rapidly changing light or pedestrian traffic. \n6.2.4 The test facility should be well ventilated and free of fumes. Air used for aeration \nmust be free of oil and fumes. Filters to remove oil. water. and bacteria are desirable. \nOil-free air pumps should be used where possible. Particulates can be removed from the \nair using filters such a.. Balston\u00ae Grade BX (Balston. Inc.. Lexington. MA) or \nequivalent. and oil and other organic vapors can he removed using activated carbon \n30 \nfilters (e.g., BALSTON\u00ae C-l filter), or equivalent. Laboratory ventilation systems \nshould be checked to ensure that return air from chemistry laboratories or sample \nhandling areas is not circulated to culture or testing rooms, or that air from testing \nrooms does not contaminate culture rooms. Air pressure differentials between rooms \nshould not result in a net flow of potentially contaminated air to sensitive areas through \nopen or loosely-fitting doors. \n6.3 Equipment and Supplies \n6.3.1 Equipment and supplies that contact stock solutions, sediments or overlying water \nshould not contain substances that can be leached or dissolved in amounts that adversely \naffect the test organisms. In addition, equipment and supplies that contact sediment or \nwater should be chosen to minimize sorption of test materials from water. Glass. type \n316 stainless steel, nylon. high-density polyethylene, polycarbonate and fluorocarbon \nplastics should be used whenever possible to minimize leaching, dissolution. and \nsorption. High-density plastic containers are recommended for holding, acclimation, and \nculture chambers. These materials should be washed in detergent, acid rinsed, and \nsoaked in flowing water for a week or more before use. Copper, brass, lead, galvanized \nmetal, and natural rubber should not contact overlying water or stock solutions before \nor during a test. Items made of neoprene rubber and other materials not mentioned \nabove should not be used unless it has been shown that their use will not adversely \naffect survival, growth, or reproduction of the test organisms. \n6.3.2 New lots of plastic products should be tested for toxicity by exposing organisms to \nthem under ordinary test conditions before general use. \n6.3.3 General Equipment \n6.3.3.1 Environmental chamber or equivalent facility with photoperiod and temperature \ncontrol (5 to 25\u00b0C). \n6.3.3.2 Water purification system capable of producing at least 1 mega-ohm water \n(USEPA, 1993a). \n6.3.3.3 Analytical balance, capable of accurately weighing to 0.01 mg. \n6.3.3.4 Reference weights, Class S -- for documenting the performance of the analytical \nbalance(s). The balance(s) should be checked with reference weights which are at the \nupper and lower ends of the range of the weight values used. A balance should be \nchecked at the beginning of each series of weighings, periodically (such as every tenth \nweight) during a long series of weighings, and after taking the last weight of a series. \n6.3.3.5 Volumetric flasks and graduated cylinders -- Class A, borosilicate glass or \nnon-toxic plastic labware. 10 to 1000 mL for making test solutions. \n6.3.3.6 Volumetric pipets -- Class A. 1 to 100 mL. \n31 \n6.3.3.7 Sewlogical pipets -- 1 to 10 mL. graduated. \n6.3.3.8 Pipet bulbs and fillers -- PROPIPET\u2019\u201c. or equivalent. \n6.3.3.9 Droppers. and glass tubing with fire polished edges. -I to 6 mm ID -- for \ntransferring test organisms. \n6.3.3.10 \\\\\u2018ash bottles -- for rinsing small glassware. instrument electrodes and probes. \n6.3.3. I 1 Glass or electronic thermometers -- for measuring water temperature. \n6.3.3.12 National Bureau of Standards Certified thermometer (see CSEP.4 llethod \n1701; I\u2019SEP.l. 1979h). \n6.3.3.13 Dissolved oxygen. pH/selective ion, and salinity meters for routine physical and \nchemical measurements. Unless a test is being conducted to specifically measure the \neffect of one of these measurements, a portable field-grade instrument is acceptable. .,I \ntemperature compensated salinity refractometer is useful for measuring salinity of water \noverlying field collected sediment. \n6.3.3.1-l Equipment for measuring ammonia (i.e.. ammonia-specific probe) is also \nnecessar,-. \n6.3.3.15 See Table 6.1 for a list of additional equipment and supplies. \n6.3.4 Test Chambers \n6.3.4.1 The test chambers to be used in sediment toxicit!, tests are 1 liter glass \ncontainers (beakers or wide-mouthed jars) with an internal diameter of 10 cm. Each \ntest chamber should have a cover. Acceptable test chamber covers include watch- \nglasses, plastic lids. and 9 cm diameter glass culture dishes. It may be necessar? to drill \na hole in each cover to allow for the insertion of a pipette for aeration. \n6.3.5 Cleaning \n6.3.5.1 .All non-disposable sample containers, test chambers, tanks, and other equipment \nthat has come in contact with sediment should be washed after use in the manner \ndescribed below to remove surface contaminants. \n1. Soak 15 min in tap water, and scrub gsith detergent, or clean in an automatic \ndishwasher. \n7 -. Rinse twice with tap water. \n3. Carefull rinse once with fresh, dilute (10%. \\\u2018:\\-\u2018I hydrochloric or nitric acid \nto remove scale. metals. and bases. To prepare a lOc7r solution of acid. add 10 \nmL of concentrated acid to 90 mL of deionized water. \n32 1. Rinse twice with deionized water. \n5 L. Rinse once with full-strength. pesticide-grade acetone to remove organic \ncompounds (use a fume hood or canopy). \n6. Rinse three times with deionized water. \n6.3.5.2 All test chambers and equipment should be thoroughly rinsed or soaked with the \ntoxicity test diluent water immediately before use in a test. \n6.3.5.3 Many organic solvents leave a film that is insoluble in water. A dichromate- \nsulfuric acid cleaning solution can be used in place of both the organic solvent and the \nacid (see ASTM, lY88), but the solution might attack silicone adhesive and leave \nchromium residues on glass. A alternative to use of dichromate-sulfuric acid could be to \nheat glassware for 8 h at 450\u00b0C. \n33 \nTable 6.1 Equipment and supplie: \\r culturing and testing estuarine and \nmarine amphipods. $11.

Test organisms should not show signs of disease or apparent stress (e.g.. \ndiscoloration. unusual behavior). If problems are observed in the culturing or testing of \norganisms. it is desirable to evaluate the characteristics of the water. See USEPA \n(1993a) and ASTM (1994a) for a recommended list of chemical analyses of the water \nsupply. \n7.1.2 Source \n7.1.2.1 The source of natural water will depend to some extent on the objective of the \ntest and the test organism that is being used. All natural waters should be obtained \nfrom an uncontaminated surface-water source upstream from or beyond the influence of \nknown discharges. Water should be collected at slack high tide. or within one h after \nhigh tide. Suitable surface water sources should have intakes that are positioned to: (1) \nminimize fluctuations in quality and contamination. (2) maximize the concentration of \ndissolved oxygen, and (3) ensure low concentrations of sulfide and iron. Full strength \nsea Hater should be obtained from areas where the salinity does not fall below 28% \nFor estuarine tests. water having a salinity as near as possible to the desired test salinity \nshould be collected from an uncontaminated area. Alternatively, it may be desirable to \ndilute full strength sea water with an appropriate fresh water source. Sources of fresh \nwater (i.e.. 0%) for dilution include deionized water. uncontaminated well or spring \nwater, or an uncontaminated surface-water source. Municipal-water supplies may be \nvariable and may contain unacceptably high concentrations of materials such as copper. \nlead. zinc, fluoride, chlorine, or chloramines. Chlorinated water should not be used to \ndilute water utilized for culturing or testing because residual chlorine and chlorine- \nproduced oxidants are toxic to many aquatic organisms. Dechlorinated water should \nonly be used as a last resort for diluting sea water to the desired salinity since \ndechlorination is often incomplete (ASTM, 1994a: USEPA, 1993a). \n7.1.2.2 For site-specific investigations. it is desirable to have the water-quality \ncharacteristics of the overlying water (i.e.. salinity) as similar as possible to the site \nwater. For certain applications the experimental design might require use of water from \nthe site where sediment is collected. In estuarine systems. however. the pore water \nsalinity of sediments may not be the same as the overlying water at the time of collection \n(Sanders et al., 1965). \n36 \n7.1.2.3 Water that might be contaminated with facultative pathogens may be passed \nthrough a properly maintained ultraviolet sterilizer equipped with an intensity meter \nand flow controls or passed through a filter with a pore size of 0.45 \u00b5m or less. \n7.1.2.4 Natural sea water might need aeration using air stones, surface aerators, or \ncolumn aerators. Adequate aeration will stabilize pH, bring concentrations of dissolved \noxygen and other gases into equilibrium with air, and minimize oxygen demand and \nconcentrations of volatiles. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in source water \nshould be between 90 to 100% saturation to help ensure that dissolved oxygen \nconcentrations are acceptable in test chambers. Natural sea water used for \nholding/acclimating, culturing, and testing amphipods should be filtered ( [ 5 \u00b5m) shortly \nbefore use to remove suspended particles and organisms. \n7.1.2.5 Water that is prepared from natural sea water should be stored in clean. \ncovered containers at 3\u00b0C and used within 2 d. \n7.13 Reconstituted/Synthetic Seawater \n7.1.3.1 Although reconstituted water is acceptable, natural seawater is preferable, \nespecially for tests involving chemicals whose bioavailability is affected by seawater \nchemistry. Reconstituted water is prepared by adding specified amounts of reagent- \ngrade chemicals to high-purity distilled or deionized water (ASTM, 1988: USEPA. \n1993a) Acceptable high-purity water can be prepared using deionization. distillation, or \nreverse-osmosis units (Section 6.3.3.2; USEPA, 1993a). Test water can also be prepared \nby diluting natural water with deionized water (Kemble et al., 1993). \n7.1.3.2 Deionized water should be obtained from a system capable of producing at least \n1 mega-ohm water. If large quantities of high quality deionized water are needed. it \nmay be advisable to supply the laboratory grade water deionizer with preconditioned \nwater from a mixed-bed water treatment system. \n7.1.3.3 Reconstituted sea water is prepared by adding specified amounts of a suitable \nsalt reagent to high-purity distilled or deionized water (ASTM, 1988: USEPA, 199la). \nSuitable salt reagents can be reagent grade chemicals. commercial sea salts. such as \nForty Fathoms\u00ae, Instant Ocean\u2019, or HW Marinemix\u00ae. Pre-formulated brine (e.g.. 60 to \n90%). prepared with dry ocean salts or heat-concentrated natural sea water, can also \nbe used. \n7.1.3.4 A synthetic sea formulation called GP2 is prepared with reagent grade chemicals \nthat can be diluted with a suitable high-quality water to the desired salinity (USEPA. \n1994c). \n7.1.3.5 To obtain the desired holding or acclimation salinity, sea salts or brine can be \nadded to a suitable freshwater or distilled water, or the laboratory\u2019s sea water supply \nmay be diluted with a suitable freshwater or distilled water. \n37 \n7.1.3.6 The suitability and consistency of a particular salt formulation for use in holding \nand acclimation should be verified by laboratory tests because some formulations can \nproduce unwanted toxic effects or sequester contaminants (Environment Canada, 1992). \nSalinity and pH should be measured on each batch of reconstituted water. \n7.1.3.7 Salinity, pH. and dissolved oxygen should be measured on each batch of \nreconstituted water. The reconstituted water should be aerated before use to adjust pH \nand dissolved oxygen to the acceptable ranges (e.g., Section 7.1.3.4.1). Reconstituted sea \nwater should be filtered (15 pm) shortly before use to remove suspended particles and \nshould be used within 24 h of filtration. I.\u2018SEP.4 (1993a) recommends using a batch of \nreconstituted water within a two week period. \n7.2 Reagents \n7.2.1 Data sheets should be followed for reagents and other chemicals purchased from \nsupply houses. The test material(s) should be at least reagent grade. unless a test on \nformulation commercial product, technical-grade, or use-grade material is specifically \nneeded. Reagent containers should be dated when received from the supplier, and the \nshelf life of the reagent should not be exceeded. Working solutions should be dated \nwhen prepared and the recommended shelf life should not be exceeded. \n7.3 standards \n7.3.1 Appropriate standard methods for chemical and physical analyses should be used \nwhen possible. For those measurements for which standards do not exist or are not \nsensitive enough. methods should be obtained from other reliable sources. \n38 \nSection 8 \nSample Collection, Storage, Manipulation, \nand Characterization \n8.1 Collection \n8.1.1 Before the preparation or collection of sediment, a procedure should be \nestablished for the handling of sediments that might contain unknown quantities of toxic \ncontaminants (Section 5). \n8.1.2 A benthic grab (i.e., PONAR, Smith-;MacIntyre. Van Veen) or core sampler are \npreferred sediment samplers because disturbance of sediment samples with these devices \nis minimized relative to dredge samplers. Although selective sub-sampling, compositing. \nand homogenization of sediment samples are necessary for most routine applications \naddressed by this manual. collection and handling in the field should involve as little \ndisruption as possible. Disruption of sediment samples will cause the loss of sediment \nintegrity, and may cause changes in chemical speciation and chemical equilibrium \n(ASTM. 1994a). Sediments are spatially and temporally variable (Stemmer et al.. \n1990a). Replicate samples should be collected to determine variance in sediment \ncharacteristics. Sediments should be collected to a depth appropriate for the stud, \nobjectives. For example. samples collected for evaluations of dredged material should \ninclude all sediment to project depth. Surveys of the toxicity of surficial sediment are \noften based on cores of the upper 2-cm sediment depth. \n8.1.3 Exposure to direct sunlight during collection should be minimized. especially if the \nsediment contains photolytic compounds. Removal of sediment from the sampling \ndevice and subsequent allocation to storage containers or homogenization should be \naccomplished using spoons, trowls, etc. made of, or coated in, inert materials (e.g.. \nTeflon\u00ae, kynar). Sediment samples should be cooled to 4\u00b0C in the field before return to \nthe laboratory or shipment (ASTM, 1994a). Dry ice can be used to cool samples in the \nfield: however, sediments should never be frozen. Monitors can be used to measure \ntemperature during shipping (e.g., TempTale Temperature Monitoring and Recording \nSystem, Sensitech, Inc., Beverly, MA). \n8.1.4 For additional information on sediment collection and shipment see ASTM \n(1994a). \n8.2 Storage \n8.2.1 Manipulation or storage can alter bioavailability of contaminants in sediment \n(Burton and Ingersoll, 1994); however, the alterations that occur may not substantially \naffect toxicity. Storage of sediment samples for several months at 4\u00b0C did not result in \nsignificant changes in chemistry or toxicity (T. Dillon and H. Tatem. USCOE. Vicksburg. \nMS, personal communication: G.T. Ankley and D. Foe, USEPA. Duluth, MN. \nunpublished data): however, others have demonstrated changes in spiked sediment \nwithin days to weeks (e.g., Burton, 1991; Stemmer et al,. 1990a). Sediments primarily \n39 \ncontaminated with non-ionic. nonvolatile organic compounds will probably change little \nduring storage because of their relative resistance to biodegradation and sorption to \nsolids. However, metals and metalloids may be affected by changing redox, oxidation. or \nmicrobial metabolism (such as with arsenic, selenium, mercury, lead. and tin: all of \nwhich are methylated by, a number of bacteria and fungi). Metal contaminated \nsediments may need to be tested relatively soon after collection with as little \nmanipulation as possible (Burton and Ingersoll. 1994). \n8.2.2 Given that the contaminants of concern and the influencing sediment \ncharacteristics are not always known a priori, it is desirable to hold sediments in the \ndark at 4\u00b0C and start tests soon after collection from the field. Recommended sediment \nholding time ranges from less than two (ASTM, 1994a) to less than eight weeks (USEPA- \nUSCOE. 1994), If whole sediment tests are started after two weeks of collection, it may \nbe desirable to conduct additional characterizations of sediment to evaluate possible \neffects of storage on sediment. For example. concentrations of contaminants of concern \ncould be measured in pore water within two weeks from sediment collection and at the \nstart of the sediment test (Kemble et al., 1993). Ingersoll et al. (1993) recommend \nconducting a toxicity test with pore water within two weeks from sediment collection \nand at the start of the sediment test. Freezing and longer storage might further change \nsediment properties such as grain size or contaminant partitioning and should be \navoided (ASTM, 1994a): Schuytema et al.. 1989 K.E. Day, Environment Canada, \nBurlington, Ontario, personal communication). Sediment should be stored with no air \nover the sealed samples (no headspace) at 4\u00b0C before the start of a test (Shuba et al., \n1978: ASTM, 1994a). Sediment may be stored in containers constructed of suitable \nmaterials as outlined in Section 6. It is desirable to avoid contact with metals, including \nstainless steel and brass sieving screens, and some plastics. \n8.3 Manipulation \n8.3.1 Homogenization \n8.3.1.1 Sediment samples tend to settle during shipment. As a result.. water above the \nsediment should not be discarded, but should be mixed back into the sediment during \nhomogenization. If warranted, sediment samples should be press-sieved through a 1 or \n1 mm mesh stainless steel screen to remove indigenous organisms. Press-sieving is \nperformed primarily to remove predatory organisms, large debris, or organisms \ntaxonomically similar to the test species. Certain USEPA program offices may \nrecommend that sediments should not be press-sieved. Also, it may not be necessary to \npress-sieve sediments if previous experience has demonstrated the absence of potential \ninterferences, including predatory or competitive organisms or large debris, or if large \ndebris or predators can be removed with forceps or other suitable tools. The presence \nof an abundance of amphipods that are taxonomically similar to the test species should \nprompt press-sieving. This is particularly true if endemic Ampeliscidae are present and \nA. abdita is the test species because it may be difficult to remove all of the resident \namphipods from their tubes. If sediments must be sieved, it may be desirable to perform \nselect analyses (e.g., pore-water metals or DOC, AVS. TOC) on samples before and after \nsieving to document the influence of sieving on sediment chemistry. \n8.3.1.2 If sediment is collected from multiple field samples. the sediment can be pooled \nand mixed using stirring or a rolling mill. feed mixer. or other suitable apparatus (see \nASTM, 1994a). It is preferable to homogenize sediments by gentle hand mixing. \nAlthough potentially disruptive, large numbers of sediments may demand the use of a \nmechanical aid. Mechanical homogenization of sediment can be accomplished using a \nmodified 30-cm bench-top drill press (Dayton Model 3Z993) or a variable-speed hand- \nheld drill outfitted with a stainless steel auger (diameter 7.6 cm. overall length 38 cm. \nauger bit length 25-4 cm: Augers Unlimited, Exton. P.A: Kemble et al.. 1994). These \nprocedures could also be used to mix test sediment with a control sediment in dilution \nexperiments. \n8.3.2 Sediment Spiking \n8.3.2.1 Test sediment can be prepared by manipulating the properties of a control \nsediment. Mixing time (Stemmer et al.. 1990a) and aging (Word et al.. 1987: Landrum. \n1989 Landrum and Faust, 1992) of spiked sediment can affect responses. Many studies \nwith spiked sediment are often started only a few days after the chemical has been \nadded to the sediment. This short time period may not be long enough for sediments to \nequilibrate with the spiked chemicals. Consistent spiking procedures should be followed \nin order to make interlaboratory comparisons. It is recommended that spiked sediment \nbe aged at least one month before starting a test: however equilibration for some \nchemicals may not be achieved for long periods of time. \n8.3.2.1.1 The cause of sediment toxicity and the magnitude of interactive effects of \ncontaminants can be estimated by spiking a sediment with chemicals or complex waste \nmixtures (Lamberson and Swartz, 1992). Sediments spiked with a range of \nconcentrations can be used to generate either point estimates (e.g.. LC5O) or a minimum \nconcentration at which effects are observed (lowest observable effect concentration: \nLOEC). The influence of sediment physico-chemical characteristics on chemical toxicity \ncan also be determined with sediment-spiking studies (Adams et al., 1985). \n8.3.2.2 The test material(s) should be at least reagent grade, unless a test on formulation \ncommercial product, technical-grade. or use-grade material is specifically needed. \nBefore a test is started, the following should be known about the test material: (1) the \nidentity and concentration of major ingredients and impurities, (2) water solubility in \ntest water, (3) estimated toxicity to the test organism and to humans, (4) if the test \nconcentration(s) are to be measured, the precision and bias of the analytical method at \nthe planned concentration(s) of the test material, and (5) recommended handling and \ndisposal procedures. \n8.3.2.2.1 Organic compounds have been added in the dry form or coated on the inside \nwalls of the mixing container (Ditsworth et al., 1990). Metals are generally added in an \naqueous solution (ASTM. 1994a: Carlson et al., 1991; Di Toro et al.. 1990). If an \norganic solvent is used, the solvent in the sediment should be at a concentration that \ndoes not affect the test organisms. Concentrations of the chemical in the pore water and \nin whole sediment should be monitored at the beginning and end of a test. \nX.3.2.3 I\u2018se of a solvent other than water should be avoided if possible. .Addition of \nilrganic solvents may\u2019 dramatically influence the concentration of dissolved organic \ncarbon in pore water (G.T. Ankley. USEPA. Duluth. MN. personal communication). If \nan organic solvent must be used. both a solvent-control and a negative-control sediment \nmust be included in a test. The solvent in the sediment should be at a concentration \nthat does not affect the test organism. The solvent control must contain the highest \nconcentration of solvent present and must be from the same batch used to make the \n4tock solution (see .AST\\l, 1988). The same concentration of solvent should be used in \nall treatments. If an organic solvent is used as a carrier. it may be possible to perform \nsuccessive washes of sediment to remove most of the solvent while leaving the compound \nof study t Harkey et al., 1994). \n8 3 1 1 If the concentration of solvent is not the same in all test solutions that contain . . .m. \ntest material. a solvent test should be conducted to determine whether survival, growth. \nor reproduction of the test organisms is related to the concentration of the solvent. \nX.3.2.4.1 If the test contains both a negative control and a solvent control, the survival. \ngrowth. or reproduction of the organisms tested should be compared. If a statistically \nGgnificant difference is detected between the two controls. only the solvent control may \nbe used for nteeting the acceptability of the test and as the basis for calculating results. \nThe negative control might provide additional information on the general health of the \norganisms tested. If no statistically significant difference is detected. the data from both \ncontrols should be used for meeting the acceptability of the test and as the basis for \ncalculating the results (AST>l. 1992). \nX.3.2.5 Test Concentration(s) for Laboratory Spiked Sediments \nXl . . .2.5.1 If a test is intended to generate an LCSO, the selected test concentrations \nchould bracket the predicted LCW. The prediction might be based on the results of a \ntest on the same or a similar test material with the same or a similar test organism. The \nLC50 of a particular compound may vary depending on physical and chemical sediment \ncharacteristics. If a useful prediction is not available. it is desirable to conduct a range- \nfinding test in which the organisms are exposed to a control and three or more \nconcentrations of the test material that differ by a factor of ten. Results from water- \nonly tests could be used to establish concentrations to be tested in a whole sediment test \nbased on predicted pore-water concentrations tDi Toro et al.. 1991). \n8.3.2.5.2 Bulk-sediment chemical concentrations might be normalized to factors other \nthan dry weight. For example, concentrations of non-polar organic compounds might be \nnormalized to sediment organic-carbon content and simultaneously extracted metals \nntight be normalized to acid volatile sulfides (Di Toro et al. 1000: Di Toro et al. 1991). \nX.3.2.5.3 In some situations it might be necessary to only determine whether a specific \nconcentration of test material is toxic to the test organism, or whether adverse effects \noccur above or below a specific concentration. W\u2019hen there is interest in a particular \nccmcentration. it might only be necessary to test that concentration and not to determine \nan LC50. \n42 \n8.3.2.6 Addition of test material(s) to sediment may be accomplished using various \nmethods, such as a: (1) rolling mill (preferred), (2) feed mixer. or (3) hand mixing \n(.\\STYI, 1904a). hlodifications of the mixing techniques might be necessar) to allow \ntime for a test material to equilibrate \\tith the sediment. \\fixing time of spiked \nsediment should be limited from minutes to a few hours and temperature should be kept \nIon to minimize potential changes in the physico-chemical and microbial characteristics \nof the sediment (.ASTbl. 19Wa). Duration of contact between the chemical and sediment \ncan affect partitioning and bioavailability (Word et al.. 1987). Care should be taken to \nensure that the chemical is thoroughly and evenly distributed in the sediment. Analyses \nof sediment subsamples is advisable to determine the degree of mixing homogeneih \n(Ditsworth et al., IWO). Uoreover. results from sediment-spiking studies should be \ncompared with the response of test organisms to chemical concentrations in natural \nsediments (Lamberson and Swartz, 1988). \n8.4 Characterization \nX4.1 All sediments should be characterized and at least the following determined: \nsalinity, pH. and ammonia of the pore water, organic carbon content (total organic \ncarbon, TOC), particle size distribution (percent sand, silt, clay), and percent water \ncontent (AST\\I, lY94a: Plumb, 1981). Salinity of sediment pore water should be \nmeasured on the supernatant of an aliquot of the sediment using a refractometer or \nconductivity meter. See Section X.4.4.7 for methods to isolate pore water. \n8.4.2 Other analyses on sediments might include: biological oxygen demand, chemical \noxygen demand, cation exchange capacity, Eh, total inorganic carbon, total volatile \nsolids, acid volatile sulfides, metals, synthetic organic compounds, oil and grease. \npetroleum hydrocarbons, as well as interstitial water analyses for varous physico- \nchemical parameters. \n8.4.3 hlacrobenthos may be quantified by subsampling the field-collected sediment. If \ndirect comparisons are to be made. subsamples for toxicity testing should be collected \nfrom the same sample for analysis of sediment physical and chemical characterizations. \nQualitative descriptions of the sediment may include color, texture, presence of hydrogen \nsulfide, and presence of indigenous organisms. hlonitoring the odor of sediment samples \nshould be avoided because of potential hazardous volatile contaminants. It may be \ndesirable to describe color and texture gradients that occur with sediment depth. \n8.4.4 Analytical Methodology \n8.4.4.1 Chemical and physical data should be obtained using appropriate standard \nmethods whenever possible. For those measurements for which standard methods do \nnot exist or are not sensitive enough. methods should be obtained from other reliable \nsources. \nt2.4.42 The precision. accuracy, and bias of each analytical method used should be \ndetermined in the appropriate matris: that is. sediment, water, tissue. Reagent blanks \nand analytical standards should be anal,,zed and recoveries should be calculated. \n43 \nK-4.1.3 Concentration of spiked test material(s) in sediment. interstitial water. and \noverlying water should be measured as often as practical during a test. If possible. the \nconcentration of the test material in overlying water, interstitial water and sediments \nshould be measured at the start and end of a test. Measurement of test material(s) \ndegradation products might also be desirable. \nti.1.4.4 Separate chambers should be set up at the start of a test and destructively \nsampled during and at the end of the test to monitor sediment chemistry. Test \norganisms might be added to these extra chambers depending on the objective of the \nstud\\ . \u2019 \nX.4.4.5 Yvleasurement of test material(s) concentration in water can be accomplished by \npipeting water samples from about 1 to 2 cm above the sediment surface in the test \nchamber. Overlying water samples should not contain any surface debris, any material \nfrom the sides of the test chamber, or any sediment. \n8.4.4.6 Xleasurement of test material(s) concentration in sediment at the end of a test \ncan be taken by siphoning most of the overlying water without disturbing the surface of \nthe sediment. then removing appropriate aliquots of the sediment for chemical analysis. \n8.44.7 A variety of procedures have been used to isolate interstitial water including \ncentrifugation, filtration, pressure, or by using an interstitial water sampler: however, \ncentrifugation without filtration is the recommended procedure (Ankley and Schubauer- \nBerigan, 1994). Filtration may reduce concentrations of materials in interstitial water \n(Schults et al.. 19y2). Care should be taken to ensure that contaminants do not \ntransform, degrade. or volatilize during isolation or storage of the interstitial water \nsample. \nSection 9 \nQuality Assurance and Quality Control \n9.1 Introduction \n9.1.1 Developing and maintaining a laboratory Quality Assurance (QA) program \nrequires an ongoing commitment by laboratory management and also includes the \nfollowing: (1) appointment of a laboratory quality assurance officer with the \nresponsibility and authority to develop and maintain a QA program. (2) preparation of a \nQuality Assurance Project Plan with Data Quality Objectives, (3) preparation of written \ndescriptions of laboratory Standard Operating Procedures (SOPS) for test organism \nculturing, testing, instrument calibration, sample chain-of-custody. laboratory sample \ntracking system. and (4) provision of adequate, qualified technical staff and suitable \nspace and equipment to assure reliable data. Additional guidance for QA can be \nobtained in USEPA (1989c). \n9.1.2 QA practices within a testing laboratory should address all activities that affect \nthe quality of the final data. such as: (1) sediment sampling and handling, (2) the source \nand condition of the test organisms, (3) condition and operation of equipment. (4) test \nconditions. (5) instrument calibration, (6) replication. (7) use of reference toxicants. (8) \nrecord keeping, and (9) data evaluation. \n9.1.3 Quality Control (QC) practices, on the other hand, consist of the more focused. \nroutine, day-to-day activities carried out within the scope of the overall QA program. \nFor more detailed discussion of quality assurance, and general guidance on good \nlaboratory practices related to testing see FDA (1978). USEPA (1979a). USEPA (1980a). \nUSEPA (1980b). USEPA (1993a). USEPA (1994b). USEPA (1994c). DeWoskin (1984). \nand Taylor (1987). \n9.2 Performance-based Criteria \n9.2.1 USEPA Environmental Monitoring Management Council (EMMC) recommended \nthe use of performance-based methods in developing standards for chemical analytical \nmethods (Williams, 1993). Performance-based methods were defined by EMMC as a \nmonitoring approach which permits the use of appropriate methods that meet pre- \nestablished demonstrated performance standards. Minimum required elements of \nperformance, such as precision, reproducibility. bias. sensitivity. and detection limits \nshould be specified and the method should be demonstrated to meet the performance \nstandards. \n9.2.2 Therefore, a performance-based criteria approach was selected as the preferred \nmethod through which individual laboratories should evaluate culture methods or the \nquality of field-collected organisms rather than by control-based criteria. This method \nwas chosen to allow each laboratory to optimize culture methods. determine the quality \nof field-collected organisms, and minimize effects of test organism health on the \nreliability and comparability of test results. See Table 11.3 for a listing of performance \n45 \ncriteria for culturing L. plumulosus. determining the quality of field-collected organisms, \nand evaluating the outcome of sediment tests. \n9.3 Facilities, Equipment, and Test Chambers \n9.3.1 Separate areas for test organism culturing and testing areas must be provided to \navoid loss of cultures due to cross-contamination. Ventilation systems should be \ndesigned and operated to prevent recirculation or leakage of air from chemical analysis \nlaboratories or sample storage and preparation areas into test organism culturing or \nsediment testing areas. and from sediment testing laboratories and sample preparation \nareas into culture rooms. \n9.3.2 Equipment for temperature control should be adequate to maintain recommended \ntest-water temperatures. Recommended materials should be used in the fabricating of \nthe test equipment which comes in contact with the sediment or overlying water. \n9.3.3 Before a sediment test is conducted in a new facility. a \u201cnon-contaminant\u201d test \nshould be conducted in which all test chambers contain a control sediment and overlying \nwater. This information is used to demonstrate that the facility. control sediment, water, \nand handling procedures provide acceptable responses of test organisms (Section 9.14). \n9.4 Test Organism \n9.4.1 The organisms should appear healthy, behave normally. feed well, and have low \nmortality (e.g.. <15%) in cultures. during holding, and in test controls. The species of \ntest organisms should be positively identified. Test organisms should not show signs of \ndisease or apparent stress (e.g., discoloration. unusual behavior). \n9.5 Water \n9.5.1 The quality of water used for organism culturing and testing is extremely \nimportant. Overlying water used in culturing, holding, acclimation. and testing \norganisms should be uniform in quality. Acceptable water should allow satisfactory \nsurvival, growth or reproduction of the test organisms. See Section 7 for guidance on \nselection and preparation of high quality test water. \n9.6 Sample Collection and Storage \n9.6.1 Sample holding times and temperatures should conform to conditions described in \nSection 8. \n9.7 Test Conditions \n9.7.1 It is desirable to measure temperature continuously in at least one chamber \nduring the each test. Temperatures should be maintained within the limits specified for \neach test. Dissolved oxygen. salinity. ammonia. and pH should he checked as prescribed \nin Section 11.3. \n46 \n9.8 Quality of Test Organisms \n9.8.1 If test organisms are obtained from culture, monthly reference-toxicity tests should \nbe conducted on all test organisms using procedures outlined in Section 9.16. If \nreference-toxicity tests are not conducted monthly. the lot of organisms used to stat-t a \nsediment test must be evaluated using a reference toxicant. \n9.8.2 The quality of test organisms obtained from an outside source, regardless of \nwhether they are from culture or collected from the field. must be verified b> \nconducting a reference-toxicity test concurrently with the sediment test. For cultured \norganisms, the supplier should provide data with the shipment describing the histor! of \nthe sensitivity of organisms from the same source culture. For field-collected organisru.r. \nthe supplier should provide data with the shipment describing the collection location. the \ntime and date of collection. the water salinity and temperature at the time of collection. \nand collection site sediment for holding and acclimation purposes. If the supplier ha.4 \nuot conducted five reference toxicity tests with the test organism, it is the responsibilit! \nof the testing laboratory to conduct these five reference toxicity tests before starting a \nsediment test (Section Y.14.1). \nY.8.3 The supplier should also certify the species identification of the test organisms. \nand provide the taxonomic references, or name(s) of the taxonomic espert(s) consulted. \nY.9 Quality of Food \n9.Y.l Problems with the nutritional suitability of the food will be reflected in the \nsurvival, growth, or reproduction of C. pfumuhus in cultures (see Section 10.5.8). \nAdditionally, survival in sediment tests conducted with A. abdira and L. plumulosus llliI> \nbe affected by the nutritional suitability of food provided during holding and \nacclimation. \nY.10 Test Acceptability \n9.10.1 For the test results to be acceptable, survival at 10 d must equal or exceed OOf\u2019~ \nfor all four amphipod species in the control sediment. See Table 11.3 for additional \nrequirements for acceptability of the tests. \n9.10.2 An individual test may be conditionally acceptable if temperature, dissolved \noxygen, and other specified conditions fait outside specifications. depending on the \ndegree of the departure and the objectives of the tests (see Table 11.31. The \nacceptability of a test will depend on the experience and professional judgment of the \nlaboratory analyst and the reviewing staff of the regulatory authority. <Any deviation \nfrom test specifications should be noted when reporting data from a test. \n47 \n9.11 Analytical Methods \nY.ll.l .-III routine chemical and physical analyses for culture and testing Hater. food. \nand sediment should include established quality assurance practices outlined in I\u2018SEP.4 \nmethods manuals (l\u2019SEP.4. lY7Ya: IISEPA, lY7Yb: USEP.l. lY93d). \n0.11.2 Reagent containers should be dated when received from the supplier. and the \nshelf life of the reagent should not be esceeded. \\Vorking solutions should be dated \nwhen prepared and the recommended shelf life should not be exceeded. \n9.12 Calibration and Standardization \nY.12.1 Instruments used for routine measurements of chemical and physical \ncharacteristics such as pH, dissolved oxygen. temperature. and salinity should be \ncalibrated before use each day according to the instrument manufacturer\u2019s procedures \nas indicated in the general section on quality assurance (see USEPA Xlethods 150.1. \n360.1. 170.1, and 120.1. C\u2018SEPA. lY7Yb). Calibration data should be recorded in a \npermanent log. \nY.12.2 .I known-qualit) water should be included in the analyses of each batch of water \nsamples (e.g., water haidness, alkalinity. conductivity). \n9.13 Replication and Test Sensitivity \nY.13.1 The sensitivity of sediment tests will depend in part on the number of replicates \nper treatment. the significance level selected, and the type of statistical anal!%. If the \nvariability remains constant, the sensitivity of a test will increase as the number of \nreplicates is increased. The minimum recommended number of replicates varies with \nthe objectives of the test and the statistical method used for analysis of the data \n(Section 12). \n9.14 Demonstrating Acceptable Performance \n\u20181.141 It is the responsibility of a laboratory to demonstrate its ability to obtain \nconsistent. precise results with reference toxicants before it performs sediment tests (see \nSection 0.16). Intralaboratory precision. expressed as a coefficient of variation (VI\u2018). of \nthe range in response for each type of test to be used in a laboratory should be \ndetermined by performing five or more tests with different batches of test organisms. \nusing the same reference toxicant, at the same concentrations, with the same test \nconditions ie.g., the same tes\u2019t duration, type of water, age of test organisms) and same \ndata analysis methods. This should be done to gain experience for the toxicity tests and \nas a point of reference for future testing. .A reference toxicant concentration series (0.5 \nor higher) should be selected that will consistently provide partial mortalities at t\\ro or \nmore concentrations of the test chemical (Section 12). \nY. 11.2 Before conducting tests with contaminated sediment, the laboratory should \ndemonstrate it3 ahilit? to conduct tests by conducting five exposures in control sediment \nas outlined in Table 11.1. It is recommended that these five exposures rsith control \nsediment be conducted concurrently with the five reference toxicit?. tests described in \nSection Y.14.1. \n0.143 Laboratories should demonstrate that their personnel are able to recover an \naverage of at least YO% of the organisms from whole sediment. For example. test \norganisms could be added to control sediment or test sediments and recover! could he \ndetermined after 1 h (Tomasovic et al.. lYY4). \n9.15 Documenting Ongoing Laboratory Performance \nY.15.1 Satisfactory laboratory performance on a continuing basis is demonstratccl b! \nconducting monthly reference-toxicity tests with each test organism. For a given test \norganism, successive tests should be performed with the same reference tozicant. at the \nsame concentrations, in the same type of water, generating LC5Os using the same data \nanalysis method (Section 131. \nY.15.2 Outliers, which are data falling outside the control limits. and trends of \nincreasing or decreasing sensitivity are readily identified. If the reference tosicit\\, datum \nfrom a given test falls outside the \u201cexpected\u201d range ie.g.. -+2 SD,. the sensitivity of the \norganisms and the credibility of the test results are suspect. In this case. the test \nprocedure should be examined for defects and should be repeated with a different hatch \nof test organisms. \nY.15.3 A sediment test may be acceptable if specified conditions of a reference tosicitl \ntest fall outside the expected ranges (Section Y.10.2). Specifically. a sediment test should \nnot automatically be judged unacceptable if the LC50 for a given reference toxicit! test \nfalls outside the expected range or if mortality in the control of the reference to\\icit! \ntest exceeds 10%. All the performance criteria outlined in Table 11.3 must be \nconsidered when determining the acceptability of a sediment test. The acceptabilit? of \nthe sediment test would depend on the experience and judgement of tbe investigatcbr 3ud \nthe regulatory authority. \nY.15.4 Performance should improve with experience, and the control limits should \ngradually narrow, as the statistics stabilize. However. control limits of ?Z SD. b! \ndefinition, will be exceeded 5% of the time, regardless of how well a laborator! \nperforms. For this reason, good laboratories which develop very narrow control limits \nmay be penalized if a test result which falls just outside the control limits is rejected lit\u2019 \nfucfo. The width of the control limits should be considered in decisions regarding \nrejection of data (Section 13). \n9.16 Reference Toxicants \n\u2018I.161 Reference-toxicitv tests should be conducted in conjunction with sediment test\\ 1t) L \ndetermine possible changes in condition of a test organism (Lee. IYXO). \\I atcr-onl! \nreference-toxicity tests on cultured organisms should be conducted monthI>. 31~1 ~llc~ultl \nbe performed on each batch of field-collected organisms used for testing. De~iaticm~ \noutside an established normal range may indicate a change in the condition of the test \norganism population. Results of reference-toxicity tests also enable interlaboratory \ncomparisons of test organism sensitiviQ. \n0.16.2 Reference toxicants such as cadmium (available as cadmium chloride (CdCI,)), \ncopper (available as copper sulfate (CuSO,)), and sodium dodecyl sulfide (SDS) are \nwitable for use. No one reference toxicant can be used to measure the condition of test \norganisms in respect to another toxicant with a different mode of action (Lee, 1980). \ntlo\\re\\er. it may be unrealistic to test more than one or two reference toxicants \nroutinely. \n9.16 3 Test conditions for conducting reference-toxicity tests with A. abdita, E. estuarius, .L \nt!.. plurnulosus. and R. abrnnius are outlined in Table 911. \n9.17 Record Keeping \n9 17 I Proper record keeping is important. .A complete file should be maintained for . . \neach individual sediment test or group of tests on closely related samples. This file \nshould contain a record of the sample chain-of-custody; a copy of the sample log sheet: \nthe original berich sheets for the test organism responses during the sediment test(s): \nchemical analysis data on the sample(s): control data sheets for reference toxicants; \ndetailed records of the test organisms used in the test(s), such as species, source, age, \ndate of receipt. and other pertinent information relating to their history and health: \ninformation on the calibration of equipment and instruments; test conditions used: and \nresults of reference toxicant tests. Laboratory data should be recorded immediately to \npre,ent the loss of information or inadvertent introduction of errors into the record. \nOriginal data sheets should be signed and dated by the laboratory personnel performing \nthe tests.

It occurs on the Atlantic coast from central Maine to central Florida. \nalthough it is also found in the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico (Bousfield. 1973). \nOn the Pacific coast, it is present in San Francisco Bay, CA (Nichols et al.. 1985: \nHopkins, 1986). They are small (adult length 4 to 8 mm). laterally compressed \namphipods. Healthy animals are opalescent pink and will remain tightly curled. \nwhereas unhealthy animals tend to be translucent white, and may uncurl (T. Thompson. \nSAIC, Bothell, WA. personal communication). Often dominant members of the benthic \ncommunity, A. abdita forms thick mats of tubes with amphipod densities up to \n110,000/m2 and are often a dominant food source for bottom-feeding fish (Richards, \n1963). The tubes are narrow and approximately 2 to 3 cm in length. A filter feeder, \nA. abdita feeds on both particles in suspension and those from surficial sediment \nsurrounding the tube. Ampelisca abdita is euryhaline, and has been reported in waters \nthat range in salinity from fully marine to 10% (Hyland, 1981). Laboratory tests have \nshown the salinity application range of A. abdita in sediments is from 0 to 34% when \nthe salinity of overlying water is [ 28% (Weisberg et al.. 1992). This species generally \ninhabits sediments from fine sand to mud and silt without shell fragments. although it \ncan also be found in relatively coarser sediments with a sizeable fine component. It is \noften abundant in sediments with a high organic content. Analysis of historical data \nshows little effect of sediment grain size on survival of A. abdita during 10 d sediment \ntoxicity tests (Long and Buchman. 1989; Weisberg et al.. 1992). There is evidence that \nsediments with >95% sand may elicit excessive mortality (J. Scott. SAIC. Narragansett. \nRI, personal communication). Ampelisca abdita have been collected at water \ntemperatures ranging from -2 to 27\u00b0C (J. Scott, SAIC, Narragansett. RI, and M.S. \nRedmond, Northwest Aquatic Sciences, Newport, OR, unpublished data). Reproduction \npatterns of A. abdita vary geographically. In the colder waters of its range. A. abdita \nproduces two generations per year. an over-wintering population that broods in the \nspring, and a second that breeds in mid- to late-summer (Mills, 1963). In warmer \nwaters south of Cape Hatteras, NC, breeding might be continuous throughout the year \n(Nelson, 1980). Juveniles are released after approximately two weeks in the brood \npouch. Juveniles take approximately 40 to 80 d for newly released juveniles to become \nbreeding adults under laboratory conditions at 20\u00b0C (Scott and Redmond. 1980). \n10.1.2 Eohaustorius estuarius: Eohaustorius estuarius is a free-burrowing amphipod in \nthe family Haustoriidae. It is found on protected and semi-protected beaches from the \nlower intertidal to shallow subtidal waters exclusively on the Pacific coast from British \nColumbia south to central California (Environment Canada, 1992). They are stout \n(adult size range 3 to >5 mm) cup- or bell-shaped, dorsally compressed amphipods that \nare grayish-brown or yellowish-brown in color (Environment Canada. 1992: ASTM. \n1992). Eohaustorius esfuarius are thought to be deposit feeders. It is an estuarine \nspecies and has been reported in areas where pore water salinity ranges from 1 to 25% \n53 \n(Environment Canada. 1992: R. Caldwell. Northwest Aquatic Sciences. Newport, OR. \npersonal communication). Laboratory studies have shown a salinity application range in \ncontrol sediments for E. estuarius from 0 to 34%. Eohaustorius estuarius inhabits \nclean. medium-fine sand with some organic content. The species has exhibited \nacceptable (i.e., >90%) survival when exposed to clean sediments with a wide range of \ngrain sizes. with generally little affect on survival whether coarse-grained or fine-grained \n(i.e.. predominantly silt and clay) clean sediments are used (Environment Canada, 1992). \nHowever. some correlation between survival and grain size exists (DeWitt et al., 1989). \nFohaustorius estuarius has been collected from water temperatures from 0 to 23\u00b0C \n(ASTM). 1992: R. Caldwell. personal communication). Eohaustorius estuarius apparently \nhas an annual life cycle (Environment Canada, 1992; DeWitt et al.. 1989). Gravid \nfemales are abundant in intertidal sediments from February through July (DeWitt et al.. \n1989: ASTM. 1992). However. reproduction might occur year-round because juveniles \nare found throughout most of the year (DeWitt et al., 1989). \n10.1.3 Leptocheirus plumulosus: Leptocheirus plumulosus is a tube-building member of \nthe family Aoridae. It is found infaunally in subtidal portions of Atlantic Coast brackish \nestuaries from Cape Cod, MA. to northern Florida (Bousfield, 1973; Dewitt et al., \n1992a). It is common in protected embayments hut has been collected in channels of \nestuarine rivers up to depths of 10 m (Holland et al.. 1988: Schlekat et al., 1992). and \nhas been reported to occur in depths up to 13 m (Shoemaker. 1932). They are relatively \nlarge amphipods (adult length up to 1.3 cm) with cylindrically shaped bodies that are \nbrownish-grey in color. A distinguishing feature is a series of dark bands or stripes that \ncross the dorsal surface of the pareons and pleons. In Chesapeake Bay, densities of \nL. plumulosus can reach 28,987/m2 and 24.133/m2 in sandy and muddy sediments. \nrespectively (Holland et al., 1988). It feeds on particles that are in suspension and on \nthe sediment surface (Dewitt et al., 1992a). Leprocheirus plumulmsus is found in both \noligohaline and mesohaline regions of east coast estuaries: ambient water salinity at \ncollection sites has ranged from 0 to 15%, (Holland et al., 1988: Dewitt et al., 1992a: \nSchlekat et al., 1992; McGee et al.. 1994). Laboratory studies have demonstrated a \nsalinity application range in control sediments of 0 to 32% (Schlekat et al., 1992: \nSAIC, 1993b). It is most often found in fine-grained sediment with a high proportion of \nparticulate organic material, although it has been collected in fine sand with some \norganic content (Jordan and Sutton, 1984; Holland et al.. 1988; Marsh and Tenore. \n1990; Dewitt et al., 1992a; Schlekat et al.. 1992: McGee et al.. 1994). Analysis of \nhistorical data for L. plumulosus reveals no effect of sediment grain size on survival in \ncontrol sediment. Populations of L. plumulosus may be seasonally ephemeral. with \nmajor population growth occurring in spring and large population declines occurring in \nsummer due to action.. of predatory fish (Hines et al.. 1986) or absence of essential \nmicronutrients (Marsh and Tenore, 1990). \n10.1.4 Rhepoxynius abronius is a free-burrowing amphipod in the family \nPhosocephalidae. It occurs on the Pacific Coast from Puget Sound, WA, to central \nCalifornia in lower intertidal and nearshore subtidal zones to depths of 274 m offshore \n(ASTM, 1992: Environment Canada, 1992; Lamberson and Swartz. 1988; Kemp et al., \n1985: Barnard and Barnard, 1982). Densities in the field are reported to range from \n150 to 2200/m2 (Lamberson and Swartz. 1988: Swartz et al.. 1985). It is a medium-sized \n54 \n(adult length from 3 to >5 mm) amphipod with a stout. somewhat rounded body shape. \nColor may range from salmon pink to yellowish, grayish-brown to white with a pinkish- \nbrown hue (Environment Canada, 1992). Rhepoxynius abronius is a meiofaunal \npredator, but it also ingests sedimentary organic material (Oakden, 1984). In the field. \nR. abrmius is found where pore water salinity is no lower than 20 %r (Environment \nCanada. 1992). Laboratory tests have indicated that salinities below 25 Qr may be toxic \nto R. abrnnius t SAIC, 1993b; Swartz et al., 1985). Rhepoxynius abrrmius should \ntherefore not be chosen as the test species when the sediment pore water is ~25 \u20184, \n(Swartz et al.. 1985). Rhepuxynius abronius naturally inhabits clean. fine. sandy \nsediments tAST;Ll, 1992). A number of studies have shown some reduction in survil.al \nwhen this species is held in very fine-grained (predominantly silt and clay) sediment \n(Dewitt et al., 1988; Long et al., 1990; McLeay et al., 1991: SAIC, 1993a; SAIC, 1993b). \nNormally collected at temperatures ranging from 8 to 16\u201dC, R. abronius has survived at \ntemperatures ranging from 0 to 20\u00b0C under laboratory conditions (AST\\I, 1992). \nReproduction of R. abrmius is annual, with peak production occurring from late winter \nthrough spring (Kemp et al., 1985). \n10.2 Species Selection \n10.2.1 All four species have been routinely used to test sediments with a range of grain \nsize characteristics and pore water salinities. Selection of one or more of the four \nspecies for a particular test/investigation should take into consideration the geographic \nlocation of the testing facility and study area, the pore water salinity regime of the study \narea. and the grain size characteristics of the sediment being tested. The species that is \nused must exhibit tolerance to the physicochemical properties of every sediment included \nin a particular study. Pore water ammonia concentrations may also enter into selection \nof one species over others because the four species exhibit differential sensitivity to \naqueous ammonia. Most often it will not be necessary to discriminate among the four \nspecies, and the decision to test one species above the rest may be driven by practical or \nlogistical concerns. For example, a testing facility may choose to primarily test one \nspecies with a suitable local population in order to prevent potential complications \nassociated with shipping. However, sediments may be encountered with characteristics \nthat are outside of the tolerance range of one or more of the species. For example, grain \nsize limitations for A. abditi and R. abrunius are <lo% and >!Ml% fines, respectively. If \nthese species are exposed to sediments that exhibit textural characteristics outside of \nthese extremes, any mortality that is observed could be due to effects of grain size \nindependent of contaminants associated with the sediment. Ambiguity in interpretation \nmay be avoided by careful consideration of the test species given the sediment to be \ntested. Comparative information is available for the four species on sediment grain size \nsensitivity (Section 11.4.3), salinity application ranges (Section 11.4.4), and sensitivity to \naqueous ammonia (Section 11.4.5). \n10.3 Field Collection \n10.3.1 Field collection is presently the most common method for obtaining estuarine and \nmarine amphipods for sediment testing. All four species are commonly collected, \nshipped, and held in the laboratory. Commercial vendors are available for all four \nspecies. The availability of the appropriate size class for each species may vary \nseasonally. The collection site chosen should be one for which the presence of abundant \norganisms of the correct size and age has been demonstrated previously. and \nidentification of the species has been confirmed taxonomically (e.g., Bousfield. 1973: \nBarnard and Barnard, 1982). Collection areas should be relatively free of \ncontamination. All individuals in a test must be from the same source, because different \npopulations may exhibit different sensitivities to contaminants. The four species are \nfound in distinctly different habitats (Table 10.1). \n10.3.2 Species-Specific Habitat Characteristics \n10.3.2.1 Ampefisca ubditu is found mainly in protected areas from the low intertidal zone \nto depths of 60 m. On the .Atlantic Coast, A. abdita ranges from central Maine to south- \ncentral Florida and the eastern Gulf of Xlexico. It can also be found on the Pacific \nCoast in San Francisco Bay. Ampefisca abdita is euryhaline. and has been reported in \nwaters that range from fully marine to 10 \u2018Zc. This species generally inhabits sediments \nfrom fine sand to mud and silt without shell fragments. although it can also be found in \nrelatively coarser sediments with a sizeable fine component. This species is often \nabundant in sediments with a high organic content. ,Aggregations of A. aMi& are \nindicated by an abundance of tubes on the sediment surface, location of which can be \nfacilitated by looking through a glass-bottom bucket. Although populations may be \nseasonally ephemeral. A. abditu is routinely collected year-round for toxicity testing \nfrom subestuaries of Narragansett Bay, RI. It is also routinely collected in San \nFrancisco Bay, CA. \n10.3.2.2 Eohaustnrius esfuarius is found on protected and semi-protected beaches from \nmid-water level to shallow subtidal, within the upper 10 cm of sediment along the Pacific \ncoast from British Columbia south to at least central California (ASTM lW2; \nEnvironment Canada. 1992). Eohaustorius estuurius can be found on open coasts in beds \nof freshwater streams flowing into the ocean, and in sand banks in estuaries, above the \nlevel of other regional eohaustorids (E. suwyeri and E. washingtonianus) (Environment \nCanada, 192). It is an estuarine species. and has been reported in areas where pore \nwater salinity ranges from 1 to 25 %C (Environment Canada, 1902; R. Caldwell. \nNorthwest Aquatic Sciences, Newport, OR. personal communication). Eohuustorius \nestuurius inhabits clean. medium-fine sand with some organic content. It is routinely \ncollected for toxicity tests from Beaver Creek near Newport, OR, and on the west coast \nof Vancouver Island. BC. Canada. \n10.3.2.3 Leptocheirus pfumufosus is found in subtidal portions of Atlantic Coast brackish \nestuaries from Cape Cod. MA, to northern Florida. It is common in protected \nembayments. but has been collected in channels of estuarine rivers up to depths of 10 m. \nLeptocheirus plumufosus is an estuarine species and has been reported in areas where \nsalinity at the sediment-water interface ranges from 1 to 15 c/t< (DeWitt et al.. 1992a: \nSchlekat et al., 1992; XlcCee et al.. 1994). It is most often found in fine-grained \nsediment with a high proportion of particulate organic material. although it has been \ncollected in fine silty sand with some organic content. Populations of L. pfumufosus \nmay be seasonally ephemeral. with major population growth occurring in spring, and \n56 \n\u2018Table 10.1 Comparison of hahitat characteristics and other life history parameters of four estuarine and marine \namphipod species used in sediment toxicity tests \nCharacteristic Ampelkca Eohaustorius \nahdita estuarius Leptocheirus \nplumulosus Nhepoxynius \nabr0niu.s \nSuhstrate Relation \nGogeography \nItahitat \nI .ife Cycle \nAvailability \nlkological Importance Tube dwelling, closed\u2019 \nAtlantic-(Ml\u2019- San \nFrancisco Ray4j \nI\u2019oly-upper mesohaline\u2019 \n48 to 80 days* \nField- Potential culture\u2019 \nHigh Free burrowing\u2019 \nI\u2019acifh? \nOligo-mesohaline*~\u2019 \nAnnual? \nField\u2019 \nHigh \u2018I\u2018uhe dwelling, open\u2019 \nAtlantic\u2019 \nOligo- mesohaline\u2019 \n30 to 40 days\u2019 \nField-Cultureq~\u201c*\u201d \nHigh Free burrowing \nPacific\u2019 \nPolyhaline\u2019~\u2019 \nAnnual\u201d \nYield\u2019 \nHigh\u201d \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \nII \nY \nIO \nII \nI!

Leptwheirus \npfumulosus has been collected for taxi! :y tests from several areas in the I1laryland \nportion of Chesapeake Bay, including r:le hlagothy, Chester. Corsica, and Wye rivers. \nOrganisms have been collected for testing year-round from the Magothy River sub- \nestuary of Chesapeake Bay (C. Schlekat. SAIC. Sarragansett, RI. and B. XlcCee. \nC\u2019niversi@ of llaryland. Queenstown, \\lD. uilpublished data/personal communication). \n10.3.2.4 Rhepoxynius ubronius occurs in lower intertidal and nearshore subtidal zones \non the Pacific Coast from Puget Sound, M\u2019i, to central California. Primary habitats of \nR. abronius include nearshore subtidai zones on the Pacific Ocean coastline. and sub- \nand intertidal zones within polyhaline portions of estuaries in the Pacitic Northwest. It \nis found where the pore water salinity is no lower than 20 56~. Rhepoxynius ubronius \nnaturally inhabits clean, fine sand. It has been collected for use in toxicity tests from \nLower Yaquina Bay, OR (Swortz et al., 1989, and West Beach, Whidbey Island, M\u2019.-\\ \n(Ramsdell et al., 198% Word et al., 1989). \n10.33 Collection Methods \n10.3.3.1 Collection methods are species-dependent. Ampefiscu ubdifu and L. pfumufosus \nare subtidal, and can be collected with a small dredge or grab (e.g., PONAR, Smith- \nllclntyre, or Van Veenj. or by skimming the sediment surface with a long-handled, fine- \nmesh net. Eohuustorius esfuurius and R. ubronius occur both intertidally and subtidally. \nSubtidal populations can be collected as above, and intertidal populations can be \ncollected using a shovel. At least one-third more amphipods should be collected than \nare required for the test. \n10.3.3.2 All apparatus used for collecting, sieving, and transporting amphipods and \ncontrol-site sediment should be clean and made of non-toxic material. They should be \nmarked \u201clive only\u201d and must never be used for working with formalin or any other \ntoxic materials and should be stored separately from the aforementioned. The \ncontainers and other collection apparatus should be cleaned and rinsed with distilled \nwater, deionized water. dechlorinated laboratory water, reconstituted seawater, or \nnatural seawater from the collection site or an uncontaminated source before use. \n10.3.3.3 To minimize stress. amphipods should be handled carefully. gently. and quickly. \nand only when necessary. Sieving should be performed by slow immersion in collection \nsite water. Once sieved, attempts should be made to keep amphipods submersed in \ncollection site sea water at the ambient collection temperature at all times. Amphipods \nthat are dropped, or injured should be discarded. Once separated from the sediment. \namphipods must not be exposed to direct sunlight. \n10.3.3.4 Amphipods can be isolated from collection site sediment by gentle sieving. The \nmesh size of the sieve will depend on the species collected. Sieves with 0.5 mm mesh \nshould be used for sediment containing A. ubdita and L. pfumufosus. Larger ,--I. ubdira, \nwhich should not be used in the test, should be excluded by sieving first with a 1.0 mm \nscreen. When sieving A. abdita. only about half of the amphipods will be extracted from \n58 \ntheir tubes. The tube mat should be placed undisturbed for 20 to 30 min coax the \nremaining animals out. Sieves with 1.0 mm mesh should be used for E. es&arks and \nR. ubronius. \n10.3.3.5 Collection-site water should be used to sieve sediment in the field. A 2-cm \nthick lajer of sieved collection site sediment should be placed in transport containers. \nand this sediment covered with collection-site water. Detritus and predators recovered \nby sieving should be removed. and the collected amphipods should be gently washed into \nthe transport containers with collection site water. \n10.3.3.6 The salinity and temperature of surface and bottom sea water at the collection \nsite should be measured and recorded. An adequate portion of collection site sediment \nshould be returned with the amphipods to serve as both laboratory holding sediment \nand for use as control sediment in the toxicity test. \n10.3.3.7 During transport to the laboratory, amphipods should be kept in sieved \ncollection-site sediment at or below the collection site temperature. Containers of \namphipods and sediment should be transported to the laboratory in coolers with ice- \npacks, and the water in the containers of amphipods should be aerated if transport time \nesceeds 1 h. \n10.3.3.8 An alternate collection method for A. abdita involves transporting intact field- \ncollected tubes to the laboratory for isolation of amphipods. This method is \nadvantageous because separation of A. abdh from its tubes may be time-consuming \nwhen attempted in the field, a practice which may be impractical in cold winter months. \n,lmphipod tubes are collected as described in 10.3.1. and placed on a 0.5 mm sieve. The \nsieve should be shaken vigorously to remove most of the sediment, leaving the intact \ntubes. The tubes should be placed into a covered bucket that contains a sufficient \nquantity of collection site water to cover the collected material, and transported to the \nlaboratory as described in Section 10.2.3.7. In the laboratory, the tubes should be \nremoved from the collection buckets and placed on a sieve series consisting of a 2 mm \nmesh sieve over a 0.5 mm mesh sieve. Amphipods should be forced from their tubes bl \nspraying collection-temperature sea water on the material present on the 2 mn! sieve. \nIVhen all the tube material has been sprayed, the 0.5 mm sieve should be shaken \nvigorously to separate amphipods from any material that is present. The 0.5 mm sieve \nshould then be completely submersed, at which point the amphipods will float on the \nwater surface. The amphipods should then be skimmed from the surface with a small \naquarium net and transported to a container with sea Hater at the appropriate \ntemperature. The shaking process should be continued until oniy a few amphipods \nremain in the sieve. \n10.3.4 Life Stage and Size \n10.3.4.1 The life stage for amphipods used in sediment toxicity tests will depend on the \nspecies tested. For A. abdita and L. plumulosus, sub-adult individuals should always be \nselected for testing. The life cycle of these species is relatively short, so the likelihood of \nsenescence and any effects that could be associated with reproductive \ndevelopment/maturation are minimized if young individuals are selected. Eohaustcrrius \nestuarius and R. abronius are annual species with longer life spans than A. abdifa and \nL. plumuiosus. ;Mature individuals can be used providing they are within the \nrecommended size range. \n10.3.4.2 The size range of test animals should be kept to a minimum regardless of the \nchosen species. For all species, mature female amphipods, which are distinguishable by \nthe presence of embryos in the brood pouch or oviduct. should not be selected for \ntesting. Additionally. mature male A. abdita and L. plumulosus should not be used. \nRecommended size ranges for the four species are as follows: \nltI.3.4.3 Ampeiisca abdita: 3 to 5 mm; or those amphipods retained on a 0.71 mm sieve \nafter passing through a 1.0 mm sieve. Adult male animals must not be tested: they are \nactive swimmers and die shortly after mating. \n10.3.4.4 Eohaustorius estuarius: 3 to 5 mm; or those amphipods retained on a 1.0 mm \nsieve. Large individuals (i.e., 25 mm) should not be tested because they might be \nsenescent. \n10.3.4.5 Leptocheirus plumulosus: 2 to 4 mm: or those amphipods retained on a 0.5 \nmm sieve after passing through a 0.71 mm sieve (P. Adolphson. Old Dominion \nUniversity. Norfolk, VA, personal communication). \n10.3.4.6 Rhepoxynius abronius: 3 to 5 mm; or those amphipods retained on a 1.0 mm \nsieve. Large individuals (i.e., 25 mm) should not be tested because they might be \nsenescent. \n10.3.5 Shipping Methods \n10.3.5.1 All four species have been routinely shipped from the collection site to the \nlaboratory for sediment toxicity testing. Currently, shipping from the collection site is \nnecessary for many testing laboratories because culture methods are not available for all \nfour species. It is critical that standard, demonstrated shipping methods are utilized to \nensure that consistently healthy animals are used in successive toxicity tests. \nAdditionally, the amphipods that are received by a laboratory must meet the shipping \nacceptance criteria recommended for each species. Shipping methods and acceptance \ncriteria will vary depending on the species used. \n10.3.5.2 Ampelisca abdita: Collected amphipods should be shipped within 24 h of \ncollection. Acceptable methods are available for shipping A. abditu in sediment and in \nwater. For shipping in sediment, small plastic \u201csandwich\u201d containers (approximately \n500 mL) with sealable lids should be used. The containers are filled three-quarters full \nwith a minimum depth of 2 cm of sieved fine-grain collection-site sediment and then to \nthe top with well-aerated seawater. No more than 2(H) amphipods should be added to \neach container. Amphipods should be allowed to burrow into the sediment and build \ntubes before the containers are sealed. Containers should be sealed with lids under \nwater to eliminate any air pockets. For shipping in water-only, sealable plastic bags \n60 \n(approximately 1 L) should be used. Amphipods in their tubes should be placed in bags \nand a sufficient amount of collection site water should be added to keep the tubes moist. \nThe bag should be filled with pure oxygen before sealing, and then placed into a second \nbag. Bags should be placed in a container that has a layer of material (i.e.. styrofoam or \nnewspaper) sufficiently thick to prevent excessive movement over a layer of ice-packs. \nThe shipping container should be marked to prevent it from being inverted. \n10.3.5.3 Eohaustorius esfuarius and Rhepoxynius abronius: Shipping methods for these \norganisms are essentially the same. Small plastic \u201csandwich\u201d containers (approximately \n500 mL) with sealable lids should be used. The containers are filled three-quarters full \nwith sieved collection site sediment (fine sand) and then with a 1 cm layer of collection \nsite sea water. Not more than 100 amphipods should then be added and allowed to \nburrow. After the animals have burrowed, the overlying water should be poured off. \nbut the sediment should be moist. The containers are then sealed and ready for \nshipment. \n10.3.5.4 Leptocheirus plumulosus: Several methods have successfully been used to ship \nL. plumulnsus, including the A. abdita sediment/overlying water method (10.2.5.2) and \nthe E. estuarius/R. abronius wet-sediment method (10.2.5.3) as described above. \nAdditionally, L. pfumulosus have been successfully shipped in \u201csandwich\u201d containers. \ncubitainers. and thick plastic bags containing only well-aerated collection-site sea water. \n10.3.6 Performance Criteria for Shipped Amphipods \n10.3.6.1 The process of ensuring the availability of healthy amphipods on the day that \nthe test is set up begins when the animals arrive in the laboratory from the supplier. \nAlthough the ultimate performance criterion for amphipods utilized in sediment toxicity \ntests is achievement of 90% survival in control sediment, it would be desirable to \nassess the quality and acceptability each batch of shipped amphipods using the criteria \nthat follow. For all four species, biological criteria should include an exhibition of active \nswimming behavior upon placement in water, full digestive tracts, and an acceptable \ncolor. Ampelisca abdita should be opalescent pink, E. estuarius should be grayish- or \nyellowish white, L. plumufosus should be brownish or orangish-gray, and R. abronius \nshould be salmon pink, grayish- or yellowish-brown, or white with a pinkish-brown hue. \nMortality among the shipped animals should not exceed 5%. No sexually mature \nanimals should be included in shipments of A. abdita or L. plumufusus. The shipping \ncontainers should arrive intact, and the temperature of water or sediment in shipping \ncontainers should be between 4 and 10\u00b0C. Information on physical parameters of the \ncollection site, including at least temperature and salinity, should be provided by the \nsupplier. Finally, a quantity of collection site sediment should be included as substratum \nfor amphipods during the acclimation period, and for use as control sediment in the test. \nIt may be desirable for the testing facility to stipulate these criteria to the supplier \nwhen the animals are ordered. If these criteria are not met, the animals may have \nexperienced stress during shipment, and 90% survival in control sediment may not be \nachieved. \n10.4 Hdding and Acclimation \nIO.41 Density. Amphipods should be held and acclimated (if necessary) in containers \nt-l to 8 L volume) that contain a 2 to 4 cm layer of collection site sediment that has been \nsieved through a 0.5 mm mesh screen. Approximately 350 amphipods should be added \nto each 8 L container. Amphipod density should not exceed 1 amphipod/cm\u2019. \nl(l.4.2 Duration. Depending on temperature and saliniv at the collection site, \namphipods may have to be acclimated to standard test conditions. if necessar!\u2018. changes \nin temperature or salinity to bring amphipods from the collection site conditions to the \ntest conditions should be made gradually. Once test conditions are achieved, amphipods \nshould be maintained at these condition.. for at least two d before testing to allow for \nacclimation. Amphipods held for more than ten d should not be used for testing because \nthey may not satisfy performance control criteria. Temperature and saiinity should be \nmeasured at Least daily during the period when amphipods are being adjusted to the \nconditions of the test water. Thereafter, temperature. salinit?;, pH, and dissolved oxygen \nshould be measured in the holding containers at least at the start and end of the \nacclimation period, and preferably daily. \n10.J.3 Temperature. Overlying water temperature must not be changed by more than \n3-C per day during acclimation to the test temperature. Once the test temperature is \nreached. amphipods must be maintained at that temperature for a minimum of 2 d. A \nwater bath, an incubator. or temperature-regulated room can be used for temperature \nacclimation. \n10.-1.3 Salinity. It is unlikely that either A. abdita or R. abronius will require salinit! \nacclimation because the collection site salinity for these two species will likely be within \n3 $r of the test salinity of 28 %c. Salinity of water used for temperature acclimation for \nthese species, if necessary, should be the test salinity. or 28 C7rr. The target test salinit, \nfor E. estuarius and L. plumulosus is 20 %. and it is likely that the collection site \nsalinity will be considerably lower than this for both species. Upon arrival in the \nlaboratory, the water used to hold E. estuarius and L. plumulosus should be adjusted to \n20 \u2018Jr by adjusting the salinity in the holding container at a rate that must not exceed \n5 SC per 24 h. The amphipods should be maintained at 20 \u201crr for 2 d before testing. \nlO.J.5 Lighting. Lighting must be constant and continuous throughout the holding and \nacclimation period for all species except A. abdita. Ampelisca abdita requires a 16:s L:D \nphotoperiod to promote feeding. Fluorescent lights should be used, and they should \nprovide from 500 to 1000 lux at the surface of the sediment in holding containers. Some \nchemicals are photoactivated by ultraviolet (L\u2019V) light (Ankley et al., 1994). Fluorescent \nlight does riot contain C\u2019V light, but natural sunlight does. Lighting can therefore affect \ntoxicological responses and is an important experimental variable photoactivated \nchemicals. \n10.4.6 Water \n10.4.6.1 Provided that it is acceptable to the test organisms. either an uncontaminated \nsupply of natural sea water or reconstituted sea water can be used for holding and \nacclimation (Section 7). At a minimum, healthy amphipods must exhibit acceptable \nsurvival in holding water. and must not exhibit signs of stress. such as unusual behavior \nor changes in appearance. \n10.4.6.2 If natural sea water is used, it should be obtained from an uncontaminated area \nknown to support a healthy, reproducing population of the test species or comparatively \nsensitive species. Reconstituted sea water is prepared by adding commercially available \nsea salts to water from a suitable source, in quantities sufficient to provide the desired \nsalinity. Pre-formulated brine (e.g., 60 to 90 5%:~) prepared with dry ocean salts or heat- \nconcentrated natural sea water can also be used. To obtain the desired holding or \nacclimation salinity, sea salts or brine can be added to a suitable fresh water. natural \nestuarine water, or the laboratory\u2019s sea water supply. The suitability and consistency of \na particular salt formulation for use in holding and acclimation should be verified by \nlaboratory tests because some formulations can produce unwanted toxic effects or \nsequester contaminants (Environment Canada, 1992). Reconstituted water should be \nintensively aerated for two weeks before use (Environment Canada. 1992). Suitable \nsources of water used for preparing reconstituted sea water include deionized water or \ndistilled water. or an uncontaminated natural surface water or ground water. \nChlorinated water must never be used because residual chlorine and chlorine-produced \noxidants are highly toxic to many aquatic animals. Dechlorinated municipal drinking \nwater should be used only as a last resort because dechlorination is often incomplete. \n10.4.6.3 Assessments of the quality of the water used for holding and acclimation and \nfor preparing reconstituted sea water should be performed as frequently as required to \ndocument acceptability. Analyses of variables including salinity. temperature, suspended \nsolids, pH. dissolved oxygen, total dissolved gasses, ammonia. nitrite. pesticides, and \nmetals are recommended. Sea water used for holding and acclimating amphipods \nshould be filtered (15 pm) shortly before use to remove suspended particles and \norganisms. Holding/acclimation water prepared from natural sea water should be used \nwithin 2 d of filtration/sterilization whereas reconstituted sea water should be used \nwithin 24 h of filtration/sterilization. \n10.4.7 Feeding. Ampefisca abdita and L. pfumulosus require supplemental feeding \nduring holding/acclimation. Ampelisca abditu should be fed daily, whereas L. pfumulosus \nshould be fed every other day. Both species should be supplied with an algal ration \nconsisting of Pseudoisochrysis paradoxa or Phueodactylum tricornutum that is provided \nin conjunction with sea water renewal See Stein (1973) for procedures to culture algae. \nAfter 75% of the overlying water has been removed, each holding container should be \nrenewed with sea water at the appropriate salinity that contains algae at a concentration \nof at least 1 x IOh cells/ml. Leptocheirus plumulosus should also be provided with dry \nfood ration, consisting at a minimum of finely powdered Tetrahlin\u2019. It may be desirable \nto grind the dry food in a blender. Each container should receive approximately 0.5 g \n63 \ndry food/350 amphipods. Eohaustorius estuarius and R. abronius will utilize organic \nmaterial in the holding sediment as food and do not require supplemental feeding. \n10.4.8 Acceptability of animals. Amphipods counted into the holding/acclimation \nchambers should be active and appear healthy. Any individuals that fail to burrow or \nfail to make tubes (i.e., A. abditu) in holding sediment or that appear unhealthy during \nthe holding/acclimation period should be discarded. Apparently dead individuals should \nalso be discarded. If greater than 55\u2019~ of the amphipods emerge or appear unhealthy \nduring the 48 h preceding the test, the entire group should be discarded and not used in \nthe test. Additionally, the group should be discarded if more than 10% of the \namphipods die or become inactive during the holding period before testing. \n10.5 Culture Procedure for Leprocheirus plumulosus \n10.51 The culturing method below is based on a method described in Dewitt et al. \n(1992a). USEPA sponsored a workshop was held from 12 to 13 January 1994 in \nNewport, OR, on sediment testing (both acute and chronic) and culturing of Leptocheirus \npfumufosus. Participants arrived at a consensus on recommending that laboratories with \nlittle or no experience follow what has worked for other laboratories first. A consensus \namong workshop participants was reached on a recommended diet for cultures. and this \nwill be stated. These procedures should not be considered definitive because many \nissues contributing to optimal culture productivity have yet to be addressed. A periodic- \nrenewal culture system is used. It consists of culture bins that contain aerated sea water \nover a thin (-1 cm) layer of clean, fine-grained sediment in which the amphipods \nburrow. Culturing areas must be separate from testing areas to avoid loss of cultures \nbecause of cross-contamination. \n10.52 Starting a Culture. Amphipods for starting a laboratory culture of L. pfumufosus \nshould be obtained from a source with a verified culture (Table 10.1). Alternatively. \nL. pfumufosus can be obtained from field populations. The taxonomy of the animals \nmust be confirmed before they are introduced into existing laboratory populations. In \naddition, the ability of the wild population of sexually reproducing organisms to cross- \nbreed with existing laboratory populations must be determined. Sensitivity of the wild \npopulation to select contaminants should also be documented. The temperature and \nsalinity of the shipped water containing amphipods should be gradually adjusted to 20\u00b0C \nand 20 Rr, respectively. at rates not exceeding 3\u00b0C per d and 5 %;r per d. Feeding and \nregular maintenance should begin once the acclimation period is over. Cultures should \nbe started with approximately 300 mixed-age animals, of which only 100 should be \nreproductively active adults (i.e., individuals >3 mm in length). \n10.53 Culture Chambers. Culture chambers should be amenable to easy maintenance. \nPtastic dishpans (30 cm x 40 cm x 15 cm) have been used successfully by several \nlaboratories (Dewitt et al., lYY2a), and are recommended. Aeration, provided through \nan aquarium air stone. should be vigorous and constant. \nlO.5.4 Culture Sediment. Cultures should be established with a thin layer (-1 cm) of \nsediment that is spread on the bottom of the culture chamber. The sediment that is \n64 \nused for culture purposes should be the same as the control sediment used in sediment \ntoxicity tests. Suitable sources for culture sediment include the amphipod collection site \nor another area that harbors sediment within the physic+chemical tolerance of \nL. plumufosus that are listed in Table 4.1. Culture sediment should be press sieved \nthrough a <0.5 mm screen before using to avoid the presence of indigenous organisms in \nculture. \n10.55 Culture W\u2019ater. Culture water should be from the same source used for holding \nand acclimating test organisms and for conducting toxicit, tests. See Section 7.1.2 for \nacceptable sources of seawater. Cultures of L. pfumuhsus are maintained at a salinity of \n20 (XC. To obtain this salinity, sea water should be diluted with deionized water. \nSeawater used for culturing amphipods should be filtered (55 pm) shortly before use to \nremove suspended particles and organisms. W\u2019ater that may be contaminated with \npathogens should be treated shortly before use by filtration (10.45 pm). either alone or \nin combination with ultraviolet sterilization. Culture water prepared from natural sea \nwater should be used within 2 d of filtration/sterilization whereas reconstituted sea water \nshould be used within 24 h of filtration/sterilization. Culture water should be renewed \nthree times per week in conjunction with feeding. \n10.56 Temperature and Photoperiod. Cultures should be maintained at ZO\u2019C. The \nreproductive rate of L. pfumulnsus increases at temperatures greater than 2O\u2019:C, \nnecessitating more frequent culture thinning. Temperatures below 20\u00b0C may not foster \nsufficiently prolific reproductive rates. Fluorescent lights should be on a 16L:8D \nphotoperiod at a light intensity of 500 to 1000 lus. \n10.57 Food and Feeding \n1057.1 The following section is based on recommendations made at the I.SEP,A- \nsponsored \u201cLeptocheirus plumufosus Workshop\u201d held in Newport, OR. from 12 to 13 \nJanuary 1994. The recommendations follow the consensus of experts who culture \nL. plumufnsus for use in sediment toxicity testing. It was concluded that laboratories \nunfamiliar with this species should utilize the specific diet recommended below. \nModifications to the diet could then proceed hy laboratories in order 10 optimize culture \npractices as long as the modifications satisfied the performance criteria. \n1057.2 Culture chambers should be provided with food in conjunction with water \nrenewal. Three times a week, approximately 60 ?i of culture water should be siphoned \nfrom each culture chamber and replaced with the same volume of renewal water. The \nrenewal water should consist of seawater, cultured phytoplankton, and deionized water \ncombined to a salinity of 20 %C and an algal density of approximately lOh cells mL-\u2018. \nThe proportions will vary depending upon the salinity of the seawater and the densi@ of \nthe cultured phytoplankton. The algae used should be the chrysophyte Pseudnisot.hr~sis \nparadoxa and the diatom Phaevdactyfum tricornutum mixed 1: I v/v. Other algal species \ncan be used if it can be demonstrated that they foster amphipod growth and \nreproductive rates equal to those of the aforementioned algal species. \n65 \n10.5.7.3 The cultures should also be provided with dry food just after the water change \nis complete. The recommended dry food consists of a mixture of Tetra\\lin\u2019. dried \nalfalfa. dried wheat leaves, and Neo-Novum\u2019. TetraMin\u201d is a fish food flake, and is \navailable at most aquarium-supply stores. Dried alfalfa and dried wheat leaves are \navailable at health food stores. Neo-Novum\u2019 is a maturation feed for use in shrimp \nmariculture, and is available from Argent Chemical Laboratories, Redmond. \\C:.A. The \nmisture should be prepared at the following proportions: 4X.5% TetraXlin\u201d + 2-15 dried \nalfalfa + 24% dried wheat leaves + 4.5% Neo-Novum\u2019. The dry food mixture should be \nmade in advance in -MM) g batches. The mixture should be thoroughly homogenized into \na fine powder. ,A blender will provide best results: alternatively. a mortar-and-pestle \ncan be used. \n10.5.7.4 The amount of dry food added will depend on the density of each culture bin. \nNewly started culture bins (i.e., those with 300 mixed-age animals) should receive 0.25 to \n0.3 g of the dry food mixture per feeding for the first two weeks. Thereafter, 0.5 g of \nthe dry food mixture should be provided per feeding. Less food is provided during the \nfirst two weeks as excess food may result in microbial build-up on the sediment surface. \nThe appropriate amount of food should be measured out and sprinkled on the water \nsurface at the center of the culture bin, where it will disperse and settle evenly. \n10.58 Culture Maintenance \n10.5.X.1 Observations and Xleasurements. Cultures should be observed daily to ensure \nthat aeration is adequate in all culture chambers. Inspection for the presence of \noligochaete and polychaete worms and copepods should be conducted weekly. The \npresence of excessive densities of these or other competing or predacious organisms \nshould prompt renewaf of culture sediment after separating amphipods from other \norganisms. Cultures should be inspected for the presence of microbial build-up on the \nsediment surface in conjunction with water changes and feeding. This build-up appears \nas a white or gray growth that may originate near uneaten food. Presence of microbial \nbuild-up may indicate that the amount dry food is in excess required by the amphipods. \nAddition of the dry food mixture to culture chambers with surficial microbial build-up \nshould temporarily ctfase until the build-up is no longer present. \n10.5.8.2 Healthy cultures are characterized by an abundance of burrow-openings on the \nsediment surface. Although amphipods may leave their burrows to search for food or \nmates, they will ordinarily remain in their burrows under the daylight portion of the \nphotoperiod. .Amphipod density may therefore only be estimated by examining the \nnumber of burrow openings. An abundance of anima1s.te.g.. >15 per culture bin) on the \nsediment surface could indicate inadequate sediment quality. low dissolved oxygen \nconcentrations. or overcrowding. A culture chamber with an abundance of amphipods \nor unhealthy individuals on the sediment surface should be examined closely, and the \ndissolved osygen concentration should be measured. If the dissolved oxygen \nconcentration is below 60% saturation the culture chamber should be sieved, and the \npopulation and culture sediment examined. If the population is too dense (i.e., >15(10 \nadults per culture chamber), it should be thinned as described below. If the sediment \nbecomes an unacceptable habitat, i.e., if it is black and sulfurous below the sediment \n66 \nsurface. or contains arl escess of con1petitiv.e or predacious organisms. the healthy \nsurviving amphipods should be placed in a new culture chamber with newly prepared \nculture sediment. \n105.83 Water temperature should be measured daily and dissolved oxygen should be \nmeasured weekly. Cultures should be continuously aerated. Salinity should be \nmeasured after water renewal. or 3 times per week. Ammonia and pH should be \nmeasured with each new batch of sediment. \n10.5.8.4 Culture Density. Leptocheirus plumulosus can be prolific. and care must he \ntaken to ensure that culture chambers do not get overcrowded. Amphipods in \novercrowded culture chambers may be stressed because of food and space limitations. \ncausing the fecundity of females to drop below 5 eggs per female. Culture density must \nnot exceed 1.5 amphipods cm\u201c (i.e., 1500 animals per culture chamber) and should \nideally be maintained at approximately 0.4 amphipods cm\u201c (i.e., 400 adults per culture \nchamber). To avoid overcrowding, cultures should be thinned every two months by \nsieving through a 1 mm mesh screen. allowing young amphipods to pass through the \nscreen and remain in the sediment. Approximately 100 to 150 adult amphipods should \nbe selected from the sieved population and returned to the culture tub. The remainder \nshould be used to start new cultures or discarded. \n10.5.9 Obtaining Ampbipods for Starting a Test \n10.5.9.1 Leptncheirus plumulosus used in tests should be started witb pre-reproductive \nanimals that are 2 to 4 mm in length. To obtain animals in this size range. sediment \nfrom culture chambers containing mixed-size amphipods should be poured over a sieve \nseries that consists of the following sequence of mesh sizes: Ct.71 mm, 0.50 mm. and \n0.25 mm. Animals retained on the 0.50 mm mesh screen should be washed into a \nshallow glass pan. The smaller animals from this group should be selected for toxicity \ntesting. Gravid females should be avoided. \n10.5.9.2 Alternatively, test animals within a narrow size range are obtained by isotating \nthe smallest amphipods which are allowed to grow until they reach a testable size. To \nobtain the smallest amphipods, first transfer sediment from culture chambers containing \nmixed-size amphipods over a sieve series that consists of the following sequence of mesh \nsizes: 1.0 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm. Animals retained on the 0.25 mm mesh screen \nshould be small juveniles that are 1.1 to 2.0 mm in length. They will take approximately \ntwo weeks to reach testable size after isolation. The amphipods retained on the 0.25 mm \nscreen should be washed into a culture chamber that is set up as a normal culture \nchamber, i.e., containing a thin (-1 cm) sediment layer and maintained under culture \nconditions for the two week interim period. By the end of the two week grow-out \nperiod, the animals should be of testable size (i.e., 2 to 4 mm), and be within a narrow \nsize and age range. \n67 \nSection 11 \nTest Method 100.4 \nAmpelisca abdita, Eohaustorius estuarius, Leptochcirus plumulosus, \nor Rhepoxynius abronius 10-d Survival Test for Sediments \n11.1 Introduction \n11.1.1 Ampelisca abdita. Eohaustorius estuarius, Leptocheirus plumulosus, and \nRhepoxynius abronius have been used extensively to test the toxicity of estuarine and \nmarine sediments. The choice of these amphipod species as test organisms is based on \nsensitivity to sediment-associated contaminants, availability and ease of collection. \ntolerance of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, salinity, grain-size), ecological \nimportance. and ease of handling in the laboratory. Additionally, the species chosen for \nthis method are intimately associated with sediment by nature of their burrowing or \ntube-dwelling and feeding habits. Field validation studies have shown that amphipods \nare absent or have reduced abundances at sites where toxicity in laboratory tests. \nAmphipod sediment toxicity tests have been successfully performed for regulatory and \nresearch purposes by numerous laboratories, including state and federal government \nagencies, private corporations. and academic institutions. Test guidance for A. abdita, \nE. estuarius, L. plumulosus, and R. abronius has previously been developed (ASTM, \n1992). The four species chosen are representative of both estuarine and marine habitats \nand sediments that span the spectrum of particle sizes from tine-to coarse-grained \nsediment. Thus, either alone or in combination, they may be used to measure toxicity of \nany commonly encountered estuarine or marine sediment. \n11.1.2 Specific test methods for conducting the 10-d sediment toxicity test for the \namphipods Ampelisca abdita, Eohaustorius estuarius, Leptocheirus plumulosus, and \nRhepoxynius abronius are described in Section 11.2. Test method 100.4 was developed \nbased on Swartz et al. (1985); DeWitt et al. (1989); Scott and Redmond (1989): Schlekat \net al. (1992): ASTM (1992); and Environment Canada (1992). Results of tests using \nprocedures different from the procedures described in Section 11.2 may not be \ncomparable and these different procedures may alter bioavailability. Comparison of \nresults obtained using modified versions of these procedures might provide useful \ninformation concerning new concepts and procedures for conducting sediment tests with \nestuarine or marine organisms. If tests are conducted with procedures different from \nthe procedures described in the manual. additional tests are required to determine \ncomparability of results (Section 1.3). \n11.2 Recommended Test Method for Conducting a 10-d Sediment Toxicity Test with \nAmpelisca abdita, Eohaustorius estuarius, Leptocheirus plumulosus, or Rhepoxynius \nabronius. \n11.2.1 Recommended conditions for conducting a 10-d sediment toxicity test with \nA. abdita, E. estuarius, L. plumulosus, and R. abronius are summarized in Table 11.1.

The number of replicates and \nconcentrations tested depends in part on the significance level selected and the type of \nstatistical analysis. \\Vhen variability remains constant, the sensitivity of a test increases \nas the number of replicates increase. \nI 1.2.2 The recommended 10-d sediment toxicity test with A. abditu, E. estuarius. \nL. plumufosus, and R. abronius must be conducted at the species-specific temperature \nand salinity with a 24 h light photoperiod at a illuminance of about 500 to 1000 lux \n{Table 11.1). Test chambers are 1 L glass chambers containing 175 mL of sediment and \n800 niL of overlying seawater. Twenty amphipods are added to each test chamber at \nthe start of a test. The size range of the amphipods will depend on species that is being \ntested (see Section 10.3.1 for allowable size range for each species). The number of \nreplicates/treatment depends on the objective of the test. Five replicates are \nrecommended for routine testing (see Section 12). Exposure is static (i.e.. water is not \nrenewed), and the animals are not fed over the 10 d exposure period. Overlying water \ncan be culture water, surface water, site water, or reconstituted water. For site-specific \nevaluations. the characteristics of the overlying water should be as similar as possible to \nthe site where sediment is collected. For all other applications, the characteristics of the \noverlying water for each species should be chosen according to Table 11.1. Requirements \nfor test acceptability are summarized in Table 11.3. \n11.3 General Proaxhres \n11.3.1 Introduction of Sediment. On the day before the addition of amphipods (Day -1). \neach test sediment (either field collected or laboratory spiked) should be homogenized b! \nstirring in the sediment storage container or by using a rolling mill, feed mixer, or \nother suitable apparatus. Control and reference sediments are included. Sediment \nshould be visually inspected to judge the extent of homogeneity. Excess water on the \nsurface of the sediment can indicate separation of solid and liquid components. If a \nquantitative measure of homogeneity is required. replicate subsamples should be taken \nfrom the sediment batch and analyze for TOC. chemical concentrations, and particle \nsize. Spiked sediments should not be homogenized before introduction into test \nchambers because the equilibrium between the spiked contaminant and the sediment \npartitioning factors may be disrupted. \n11.3.1.1 .-\\ 175mL aliquot of thoroughly homogenized sediment is added to each test \nchamber. It is important that an identical volume be added to each replicate test \nchamber: at a minimum the volume added should equate to a depth of 2 cm in the test \nchamber. The sediment added to the test chamber should be settled either by tapping \nthe side of the test chamber against the side of the hand or by smoothing the sediment \nsurface with a nylon, fluorocarbon, or polyethylene spatula. Highly contaminated \nsediment should be added to test chambers in a certified laboratory fume hood. \n11.32 Addition of Overlying Water. To minimize disruption of sediment a5 test \nseawater is added, a turbulence reducer should be used. The turbulence reducer may be \n72 \nTable 11.3 Test acceptability requirements for a 10-d sediment toxicity test with \nAmpeiisca abdita. Eohaustorius estuarius.

Salinity, pH. and ammonia in the overlying water and sediment grain size \nare within tolerance limits of test species. \nB. Performance-based criteria for culturing L. plumufosus include: \n1. Laboratories should perform monthly 96-h water-onl? reference-torici@ \ntests to assess the sensitivity of culture organisms. If reference-toxicit! tests \nare not conducted monthly, the lot of organisms used to start a sediment test \nmust be evaluated using a reference toxicant (Section 9.16). \n2. Records should be kept on the frequency of restarting cultures. \n3. Laboratories should record the pH and ammonia of the cultures at least \nquarterly. Dissolved oxygen and saliniQ should be measured lreekl!. \nTemperature should be recorded daily. \n4. Laboratories should characterize and monitor background contamination \nand nutrient quality of food if problems are observed in culturing or testing \norganisms. \nC. Performance-based criteria for field-collected amphipods include: \n1. Laboratories should perform reference-toxicant tests on each batch of field- \ncollected amphipods received used in a sediment test (Section V.lf,~. \n2.

Approximately one-third more amphipods than are needed for the \ntest should be sieved from the culture or control sediment in the holding containerlc). \nand transferred to a sorting tray. The additional animals alloy for the selection IJ~ \nhealthy. active individuals. The sieve size for isolating amphipods from the culture or \ncontrol sediment will depend upon the selected species. .1mpelisca abdita and \nL. plumufosus should be isolated using a 0.5 mm ciele. whereas E. estuarws and \nR. abronius should be isolated using a 1.0 mm sieve. Sieving should be conducted with \nsea water of the same temperature and salinity as the holding and test water. Once \nisolated. active amphipods should be randomly selected using a transfer pipette or other \nsuitable tool (not forceps), and distributed among dishes or cups containing \napproximately 150 mL of test sea water until each container has twent! amphipods. \nThe number of amphipods in each dish should be verified b>, recounting before adding \nto test chambers. To facilitate recounting, amphipods may be distributed to test \nchambers in batches of 5 or 10 instead of the full complement of 20. The distribution of \namphipods to the test chambers must be esecuted in a randomized fashion. \n11.3.3.2 .Amphipods should be added to test chambers without disruption of the \nsediment by placing a &mil polyethylene. nylon. or Teflon@ disk on the water surface \nand gently pouring the water and amphipods from the sorting container over the disk \ninto the test chamber. The disk should be removed once the amphipods hale been \nintroduced. Alternatively, amphipods from the sorting container can be poured into a \nsieve cup (mesh size 10.5 mm) and gently washed into the test chamber \\rith test WI \nwater. Any amphipods remaining in the sorting container should be gentI> brashed into \nthe test chamber using test sea water. The water level should be brought up to the 9% \nmL mark, the test chamber covered, and aeration continued. \n11.3.3.3 After the addition of the animals, the test chambers should be esamined for \nanimals that may have been injured or stressed during the isolation, counting, or \naddition processes. injured or stressed animals will not burrow into sediments. arid \nshould be removed. The period of time allowed for healthy amphipods to bur? into test \nsediments will depend upon the species used. Eohausforius estuarius. L. plumul~~.vu.~, and \nR. abronius should be allowed 5 to 10 min to bury into the test sediment. .-\\!tzPeli.sr~~ \nabdita, which may take longer to build tubes, should be allowed I h. Amphipods that \nhave not burrowed within the prescribed time should be replaced with animals from the \nsame sieved population, unless they are repeatedI> burrowing into the sediment and \n75 \nimmediateI! emerging in an apparent avoidance response. In that case, the amphipods \ntire not replaced. The number of amphipods that are removed must be recorded. \n11.3.4 Test Conditions \n11.3.-1.1 Aeration. The overlying sea water in each test chamber must be aerated \ncontinuously after the water is added (i.e.. Days -1 through 10) except during \nintroduction of the test organisms. Compressed air, previously filtered and free of oil. \n\\hould be bubbled through a glass or plastic pipette and attached plastic tubing. The tip \nof the pipette should be suspended 2 to 3 cm above the surface of the sediment layer so \nas to not disturb the sediment surface. The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in \nthe crater overlying the sediment in the test chambers is maintained at or near \nsaturation by gently aerating the water. Air is bubbled through the test chamber at a \nrate that maintains a MB% DO concentration. but does not cause turbulence or disturb \nthe sediment surface. If air flow to one or more test chambers is interrupted for more \nthan one h. DO must be measured in those test chambers to determine whether DO \nconcentrations have fallen below 60% of saturation. Results may be unacceptable for \ntest chambers in which aeration was interrupted and DO concentrations fell to below \n605 saturation. \n11.3.J.2 Lighting. Lights must be left on continuously at an intensity of 500 to 1000 lux \nduring the 10 d exposure period. The constant light increases the tendency of the \norganisms to remain buried in the sediment. and thus to remain exposed to the test \nmaterial. \n11.3.1.3 Feeding. The four species of amphipods used in this method must not be fed \nduring the 10-d exposure period. \nI 1.3.4.1 bVater Temperature. The test temperature will depend on the species that is \ntested. Test temperatures were selected to be near the summertime thermal maximum \nthat each species would be expected to encounter in the environment. Eohaustnrius \nvstuarius and R. abronius, the Pacific Coast amphipods. must be tested at 15\u00b0C. \n.Ampefisca abdita must be tested at 20\u00b0C and L. plumufosus at 2S\u2019C. \n1 I .3.4.5 Salinity. The salinity of the water overlying the test sediment will vary \ndepending on the selected test species. For routine testing, A. abdita and R. abronius \n&ould be tested at an overlying water salinity of 28 \u20183r. whereas E. estuarius and \nL. plumulosus should be tested at 20 SC. Pore water salinity of each test sediment must \nbe measured prior to the initiation of a test. Sediment pore water should be obtained b> \ncentrifugation. Alternatively, salinity can be measured before homogenization in the \n\\+ater that comes to the surface in the sample container as the sediment settles. The\u2019 \npore water salinity of the test sediment must be within the salinity application range of \nthe chosen amphipod species (Table 10.2). Rhepoxynius ahronius cannot be tested when \nsediment pore water salinities are ~25 \u2018SC. Another species must be used for such \nsediments. Ampefisca abdita. E. estuarius, and L. pfumufosus can be tested over the \nentire pore water salinity range (i.e.. 0 to 34 \u20187,~) when the recommended species-specific \n76 \noverlying salinity is used. Depending on the objectives of the study. E. estuarius and \nL. plumulosus may be tested with overlying water at salinities ranging from 1 to 32 5~. \n11.3.5 Measurements and Observations \nIl.351 Temperature should be measured at least daily in at least one test chamber \nfrom each treatment. The temperature of the water bath or the exposure chamber \nshould be continuously monitored. The time-weighted average of daily temperature \nreadings must be within *l\u201dC of the desired temperature. The instantaneous \ntemperature must always be within k3\u201dC of the desired temperature. \n11.352 Salinity, dissolved oxygen. and pH of the overlying water should be measured \ndaily in at least one test chamber per treatment. and at a minimum. they must be \nmeasured in every test chamber at the beginning and the end of a test. \n11.3.5.3 Ammonia must be measured in overlying water towards the beginning (e.g.. da! \n2) and towards the end of the test (e.g.. day 8). Ueasurement of overlying water pH and \ntemperature should accompany each ammonia measurement. Simultaneous \nmeasurements of ammonia, pH, and temperature in sediment pore water should be \nmeasured at the beginning of the test. Pore water should be extracted after the \nsediment has been press-sieved and homogenized. Samples of pore water should be \nobtained by centrifugation. \n11.3.5.4 Each test chamber must be examined at least daily during the 10 d test period \nto ensure that airflow to the overlying sea water is acceptable. The number of \namphipods swimming in the water column and trapped in the air-water interface should \nbe noted. Amphipods caught in the air-water interface must be gently pushed dobrn into \nthe water using a glass rod or pipette. The number of apparently dead animals should \nbe noted. \n11.3.6 Ending a Test. Laboratories should demonstrate the abilih of their personnel to \nrecover an average of at least 00 % of the organisms from control sediment. For \nexample, test organisms could be added to control sediment and recovery could be \ndetermined after 1 h (Tomasovic et al., 1994). \n11.3.6.1 The contents of the test chambers must be sieved to isolate the test animals. \nThe mesh size for sieving the contents of the test chambers must be no larger than 0.5 \nmm. Test water should be used for sieving. hlaterial retained on the sieve should be \nwashed into a sorting tray with clean test sea water. Ampelisca abdita are tube-builders. \nand it will be necessary to make an effort to ensure that no tubes remain on the s&e. \nThe sieve should be slapped forcefully against the surface of the water to ensure that all \nof the amphipods and tubes are dislodged from the screen. Eokaustorius estuarius. \nL. plumulosus, and R. abronius are easily removed from the sediment by the sieving \np recess. \n11.3.6.2 hlaterial that has been washed from the sieve into the sorting tra) should bc \ncarefully examined for the presence of amphipods. .A small portion of the material \n77 \nshould be sorted thrc,ugh at a time. removing amphipods as they are found. Jlaterial \nfrom tests conducted with A. crbdi&z will include tubes built by the amphipods during the \ntest. The tubes must he carefully examined and teased apart under a dissecting \nmicroscope or magnifying glass because A. abditu will often remain in the tubes elen \nafter \\igorous sieving. Sumbers of live. missing. and dead amphipods should be \ndetermined and recorded for each test chamber. ILlissing animals are assumed to have \ndied and decomposed during the test and disintegrated: they should be included in the \nnumber dead in calculations of the percent survival for each replicate treatment. \nAmphipods that are inactive but not obviously dead must be observed using a low-power \ndissecting microscope or a hand-held magnifying glass. Any animal that fails to exhibit \nmovement (i.e. neuromuscular twitch of pleopods or antennae) upon gentle prodding \nwith a probe should be considered dead. \n11.3.7 Test Data. Survival is the primary endpoint recorded at the end of the IO-d \nsediment toxicity test with 4. ubdita, E. estuarius, L. piumuiosus. and R. abtwnius. The \nabilio of surviving amphipods to rebury in clean control sediment can be used to \ncalculate vffeectlre mortality. that is. the sum of dead animals plus those survivors that \nfail to rebuq. This endpoint has been used for E. estucrrius, L. plumufosus, and \nR. abronius. If it is desired to determine reburial, surviving amphipods should be \ntransferred to containers holding a 2-cm layer of 0.5 mm sieved control sediment and an \noverlying layer 122 cm) of test sea water. Salinity of the test sea water for reburial \nshould be the same as that measured in the test chamber. The number of surviving \namphipods unable to rebury in control sediment after 1 h is recorded for each test \nchamber and is used to calculate effective mortality. \n11.4 Interpretation of Results \n11.4.1 Section I2 describes general information for interpretation of test results. The \nfollowing sections describe species-specific information that is useful in helping to \ninterpret the results of sediment toxicity tests with A. clbdita. E. estuarius, L.. pfurnul~~srrs. \nand R. ahronius. \nI IA.2 Influence of Indigenous Organisms. Indigenous organisms may be present in \nfield-collected sediments. An abundance in the sediment sample of the test organism, or \norganisms tasonomically similar to the test organism, may make interpretation of \ntreatment effects difficult. The presence of predatory organisms can also adverset, \naffect test organism survival. For example. Redmond and Scott (1989) showed that the \npolychaete .Vephtys inciscc will consume Ampeliscu ahdita under toxicity test conditions. \n11.1.3 Effect of Sediment Grain Size. .All four species show tolerance to most sediment \ntypes. wifh generally little effect on survival whether coarse-grained or fine-grained (i.e.. \npredominantI> silt and clay) clean sediments are used. However. adverse effects due to \nthe grain-size distribution of test sediment ma)\u2019 occur when sediments that are either \nextremely sand, or fine depending on the species of amphipod used. In order to \nseparate effects of sediment-associated contaminants from effects of particle size, an \nappropriate clean control/reference sediment should be incorpcbrated into the test when \ntest sediments are within the range of concern for each species. Alternatively. another \n78 \nspecies that is tolerant of the sediment extreme in question might be tested in \nconjunction with the chosen species. Ranges of concern are outlined below. \n11 A.3.1 Ampelisca abditu. Survival of Ampefisca abdita in sediment that is X55- sand \nmay elicit excess mortality. but this has not been quantified (J. Scott. SAIC, \nNarragansett, RI, personal communication). Toxicity tests conducted with .A. ubdira on \nsediments that are 95% sand should be conducted with a clean control sediment \ncharacteristic of that test sediment. \nI I A.3.2 Leptocheirus plumulosus. Leptocheirus plumulosus has exhibited 190\u2019~ survival \nin clean sediments ranging from - 100% sand to - 100% silt + clay (SAIC\u2018. 1993a: \nSAIC, 1993b: Schlekat et al., 1002; J. Kavanaugh. University of W:est Florida. Gulf \nBreeze, FL. personal communication). \nI 1 A.3.3 Eohaustorius estuarius. Eohaustorius estuarius has exhibited acceptable I IOO\u2019~r i \nsurvival when exposed to clean sediments ranting from 0.6 to 100% sand tL.SEPA ERL- \nNarragansett, Pacific Ecosystems Branch, Newport, OR, unpublished data). However. \nE. estuarius naturally inhabits sandy sediments. and some correlation between survival \nand grain size has been reported by Dewitt et al. (1989) and SAIC (1993a: 1993b). with \nincreased mortality associated with increased proportions of fine-grained sediment. \nTherefore. it may be desirable to include clean control sediments with a range of particle \nsizes characteristic of those of the test sediment(s) in toxicity tests conducted with \nE. estuarius. \n11.43.4 Rhepoxynius abronius. Rhepoxynius abronius has been used to test sediments \nwith a wide range of sediment grain sizes. However, R. abronius naturally inhabits \nclean, fine. sandy sediments, and a number of studies have shown some reduction in \nsurvival when this species is held in very fine-grained (predominantly silt and clay) \nsediment (Dewitt et al., 1988; Long et al., 19yO; hlcleay et al., 1991: SAIC. 1993a: \nSAIC. 1993b). Therefore, when test sediments are predominantly silts or clays. the \nexperimental design include a silt-clay control sediment with a range of particle sizes \ncharacteristic of the test sediment(s). Alternatively, when the particle size of test \nsediments are known, regression techniques can be used to evaluate potential effects of \nfines on R.abronius survival (see DeWitt et al., 1988). \n11.44 Effects of Pore Water Salinity. The four amphipod species exhibit variability in \ntheir salinity tolerance ranges. There are two options available for laboratory sediment \ntesting regarding the choice of overlying water salinity for a given sediment. The \noptions are to either use the standard salinity for each test species. or to match the \nsalinity to that of the pore water. The range of pore water salinities in which a given \nspecies can survive for ten days when using the species-specific overlying water salinity \nis the salinitv application range. The range of salinity in which a given species can \nsurvive for ten days when the overlying water salinity is matched to that of the pore \nwater salinity is the salinitv tolerance range. In either scenario, the poterttial for a tolic \nresponse due to salinity alone exists if a species is exposed to conditions outside of its \nrange of tolerance. For estuarine sediments. it is very important to know- the pore water \n79 \nsalinity of each sediment before testing is started. to choose a species that will not be \naffected by the pore water salinity. and to use overlying water of an appropriate salinity. \n11.4.4.1 Salinity tolerance ranges for each species are as follows: Ampelisca abditu: \n20 to 32 7~ tSAIC. 1993b): Eohaustorius estuurius: 2 to 34 7~; Leptocheirus \nplumulosus: 1.5 to 32 \u2018Yr; Rhupoxynius abronius: 25 to 32 clrc. W\u2019hile there is some \nevidence of salinity-related stress for E. estuarius and L. pfumufosus at salinity extremes. \nthe breadth of salinity tolerance exhibited by these species (DeWitt et al., 1989: Schlekat \net al.. 1992: S.AlC. 1993b) is most likely sufficient for application to the majority of \nsediments that may be encountered in an estuarine system (i.e., interstitial salinity \nbetween 2 and 28 \u2018GO. If it is desirable to have matching overlying and pore water \nsalinity from areas where pore water salinities are 0 to 2 %c, an organism that has been \ndemonstrated to tolerate this salinity range should be used. either instead of or in \naddition. The amphipod Hyaleffa azteca is one such species. Likewise. sediments \ncollected from areas of high salinity (i.e.. z-32 \u20184~ for L. plumufosus) should probably \nutilize A. abdita. E. estuarius. or R. abronius. \nll.J.1.2 Salinity application ranges for each species are as follows: Ampefisca abdita \nwith overlying water salinity of 28 to 32 Rr: 0 to 34 %r (Weisberg et al.. 1992: SAIC, \n1993b): Eohaustorius estuarius with overlying water salinity of 20 Rr: 52 to 34 %r \ntDe\\t\u2019itt et al.. 1989: SAIC, 1993b); Leptocheirus plumufosus with overlying salinity of \n20 \u2018Tc: 51.5 to 32 7~ (Schlekat et al., 1992: SAIC. 1993b) and Rhepoxynius ubronius with \noverlying water salinity of 28 to 32 5~: 25 to 34 clr~ (Swartz et al., 1985: Lamberson and \nSwartz. 19881. \n11 .J.5 Effects of Sediment-associated Ammonia. Field-collected sediments may contain \nconcentrations of ammonia that are toxic to amphipods. Water column no effect \nconcentrations for the four amphipod species are presented in Table 11.4. If ammonia \nconcentrations are above these values, mortality occurring after 10 d may be due in part \nto effects of ammonia. Depending on test application. it may be desirable to lower the \nammonia concentration by manipulating the test system prior to introduction of test \norganisms if measured ammonia in the overlying water is greater than the species- \nspecific no effect concentration. If sediment toxicity tests are conducted to evaluate the \nacceptability of dredge material for disposal, the manipulations must be performed. \n1lanipulations involve flushing the test system by renewing a specified amount of \noverlying water for up to two consecutive 24 h periods. \n11.4.5 1 If ammonia is of concern to the regulatory application associated with the \nsediment toxicity test. overlying water should be sampled approximately 1 cm above the \nsediment surface prior to introduction of animals on Day 1). If overlying water ammonia \nconcentration are less than or equal to the species-specific no effect concentration listed \nin Table 11.4, then the test may proceed normally. If overlying water ammonia \nconcentration is greater than the species-specific no effect concentration listed in \nTable 11.4, then the test system must be flushed for 24 h at a rate of 6 volume \nreplacements/24 h. \ntl0 \n(600/R-94/325) \nErrata \nPages 80-82, Sections 11.4.5-11.4.5.3, Effects of Sediment- \nassociated Ammonia \nThese sections describe a procedure that can be used to reduce \nammonia concentrations in field-collected sediments prior to \nconducting laboratory toxicity tests. For dredged material \ntesting under the Clean Water Act or the Marine Protection, \nResearch, and Sanctuaries Act, the following alternative \nprocedure should be used. This procedure was described in a \nDecember 21, 1993 guidance memorandum issued by the U.S. EPA \nOffice of Wetlands, Oceans and Watersheds, U.S. EPA Office of \nScience and Technology, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nOperations, Construction, and Readiness Division. \nFor dredged material testing the following procedure should be \nused if it is necessary to reduce interstitial water ammonia \nlevels. Whenever chemical evidence of ammonia is present at \ntoxicologically important levels, and ammonia is not a \ncontaminant of concern, the laboratory analyst should reduce \nammonia in the sediment interstitial water to species-specific \nno-effect concentrations (see table 11.4 on page 81). Ammonia \nlevels in the interstitial water can be reduced by sufficiently \naerating the sample and replacing two volumes of water per day. \nThe analyst should measure interstitial ammonia each day until it \nreaches the appropriate species-specific no-effect concentration. \nAfter placing the test organism in the sediment, the analyst \nshould ensure that ammonia concentrations remain within an \nacceptable range by conducting the toxicity test with continuous \nflow or volume replacement not to exceed two volumes per day. \nTable 11.4 Gpplication limits for 10-d sediment toxicity tests with Ampefisca abdita?

If it is less than or equal to the species-specific no effect concentration, testing \nshould be initiated by adding animals. The system must be flushed at a rate of 6 volume \nreplacements/24 h over the course of the test. Overlying water ammonia should be \nmeasured again on Day 10 of the test. \n11.4.5.3 If after the initial 24 h flushing period (i.e., that described in 11.451) the \noverlying water ammonia concentration is still greater than the species-specific no effect \nconcentration, the system must be flushed for again 24 h at a rate of 6 \nvolumereplacementsI24 h. After the second flushing, ammonia concentrations in the \noverlying water should be measured again, and if concentrations are less than or equal \nto the species-specific no effect concentration listed in Table 11.4, then the test may \nproceed as described in Section 11.452. If overlying water ammonia concentrations still \nexceed the species-specific no effect concentration, it must be concluded that ammonia \ncannot be reduced to no effect concentrations without concern for flushing other \ncontaminants from the sediment. At this point, the test should still be conducted as \ndescribed in Section 11.4.5.2 After 24 h, the overlying water ammonia concentration \nmust be measured again. If it is less than or equal to the species-specific no effect \nconcentration, testing should be initiated by adding animals. The system must be \nflushed at a rate of 6 volume replacements/24 h over the course of the test. Overlying \nwater ammonia should be measured again on Day 10 of the test. \n11.4.5.3 If after the initial 24 h flushing period (i.e., that described in 11.4.5.1) the \noverlying water ammonia concentration is still greater than the species-specific no effect \nconcentration, the system must be flushed for again 24 h at a rate of 6 volume \n82 \nSection 12 \nData Recording, Data Analysis and Calculations, and Reporting \n12.1 Data Recording \n12.1.1 Quality assurance project plans with data quality objectives and standard \noperating procedures should be developed before starting a test. Procedures should be \ndeveloped by each laboratory to verify and archive data. \n12.1.2 A file should be maintained for each sediment test or group of tests on closely \nrelated samples (Section 9). This file should contain a record of the sample chain-of- \ncustody: a copy of the sample log sheet; the original bench sheets for the test organism \nresponses during the sediment test(s); chemical analysis data on the sample(s): control \ndata sheets for reference toxicants; detailed records of the test organisms used in the \ntest(s), such as species, source, age, date of receipt, and other pertinent information \nrelating to their history and health; information on the calibration of equipment and \ninstruments; test conditions used; and results of reference toxicant tests. Original data \nsheets should be signed and dated by the laboratory personnel performing the tests. \n12.1.3 Example data sheets are included in Appendix A. \n12.2 Data Analysis \n12.2.1 Statistical methods are used to make inferences about populations. based on \nsamples from those populations. In most sediment toxicity tests, test organisms are \nexposed to contaminated sediment to estimate the response of the population of \nlaboratory organisms. The organism response to these contaminated sediments is \nusually compared with the response to a control or reference sediment. In any toxicity. \nsummary statistics such as means and standard errors for response variables (e.g., \nsurvival) should be provided for each treatment (e.g., pore-water concentration, \nsediment). \n12.2.1.1 Types of data. Two types of data can be obtained from sediment toxicity tests. \nThe most common endpoint in toxicity testing is mortality. which is a dichotomous or \ncategorical type of data. \n12.2.1.2 Sediment Testing Scenarios. Sediment tests are conducted to determine whether \ncontaminants in sediment are harmful to or are bioaccumulated in benthic organisms. \nSediment tests are commonly used in studies designed to: (1) evaluate hazards of \ndredged material, (2) assess site contamination in the environment (e.g.. to rank areas \nfor clean-up), and (3) determine effects of specific contaminants. or combinations of \ncontaminants, through the use of sediment spiking techniques. Each of these broad \nstudy designs has specific statistical design and analytical considerations, which are \ndetailed below. \n83 \n12.2.1.2.1 Dredged Material Hazard Evaluation. In these studies, n sites are compared \nindividually to a reference sediment. The statistical procedures appropriate for these \nstudies are generally pairwise comparisons. Additional information on toxicity testing of \ndredged material and analysis of data from dredged material hazard evaluations is \navailable in USEPA-USCOE (1994). \n12.2.1.2.2 Site Assessment of Field Contamination. Surveys of sediment toxicity often are \nincluded in more comprehensive analyses of biological, chemical, geological, and \nhydrographic data. Statistical correlation can be improved and costs may be reduced if \nsubsamples are taken simultaneously for sediment toxicity, chemical analyses, and \nbenthic community structure determinations. There are several statistical approaches to \nfield assessments, each with a specific purpose. If the objective is to compare the \nresponse or residue level at all sites individually to a control sediment, then the pairwise \ncomparison approach described below is appropriate. If the objective is to compare \namong all sites in the study area, then a multiple comparison procedure that employs an \nexperiment-wise error rate is appropriate. If the objective is to compare among groups \nof sites, then orthogonal contrasts are a useful data analysis technique. \n12.2.1.2.3 Sediment-Spiking Experiments. Sediments spiked with known concentrations \nof contaminants can be used to establish cause and effect relationships between \nchemicals and biological responses. Results of toxicity tests with test materials spiked \ninto sediments at different concentrations may be reported in terms of an LC50, EC50, \nIC50, NOEC, or LOEC. The statistical approach outlined above for spiked sediment \ntoxicity tests also applies to the analysis of data from sediment dilution experiments or \nwater-only reference toxicant tests. \n12.2.2 The guidance outlined below on the analysis of sediment toxicity test data is \nadapted from a variety of sources including Lee et al. (1994), USEPA (1993a), USEPA \n(1993b), USEPA (1993c), and USEPA-USCOE (1994). The objectives of a sediment \ntoxicity test is to quantify contaminant effects on test organisms exposed to natural or \nspiked sediments or dredged materials and to determine whether these effects are \nstatistically different from those occurring in a control or reference sediment. Each \nexperiment consists of at least two treatments: the control and one or more test \ntreatment(s). The test treatment(s) consist(s) of the contaminated or potentially \ncontaminated sediment(s). A control sediment is always required to ensure that no \ncontamination is introduced during the experimental set-up and that test organisms are \nhealthy. A control sediment is used to judge the acceptability of the test. Some designs \nwill also require a reference sediment that represents an environmental condition or \npotential treatment effect of interest. \n12.2.2.1 Experimental Unit. During toxicity testing, each test chamber to which a single \napplication of treatment is applied is an experimental unit. The important concept is \nthat the treatment (sediment) is applied to each experimental unit as a discrete unit. \nExperimental units should be independent and should not differ systematically. \n12.2.2.2 Replication. Replication is the assignment of a treatment to more than one \nexperimental unit. The variation among replicates is a measure of the within-treatment \nvariation and provides an estimate of within-treatment error for assessing the \nsignificance of observed differences between treatments. \n12.2.2.3 Minimum Detectable Difference (MDD). As the minimum difference between \ntreatments which the test is required or designed to detect decreases, the number of \nreplicates required to meet a given significance level and power increases. Because no \nconsensus currently exists on what constitutes a biologicahy acceptable MDD, the \nappropriate statistical minimum significant difference should be a data quality objective \n(DQO) established by the individual user (e.g., program considerations) based on their \ndata requirements, the logistics and economics of test design, and the ultimate use of the \nsediment toxicity test results. \n12.2.2.4 Minimum number of replicates. Four replicates per treatment or control are the \nabsolute minimum number of replicates for a sediment toxicity test. However, USEPA \nrecommends five replicates for marine testing or eight replicates for freshwater testing \n(USEPA, 1994a) for each control or experimental treatment. It is always prudent to \ninclude as many replicates in the test design as are economically and logistically possible. \nUSEPA sediment toxicity testing methods recommend the use of 20 organism per \nreplicate for marine testing or 10 organisms per replicate for freshwater testing \n(USEPA, 1994a). An increase in the number of organisms per replicate in all \ntreatments, including the control, is allowable only if: (1) test performance criteria for \nthe recommended number of replicates are achieved and (2) it can be demonstrated that \nno change occurs in contaminant availability due to the increased organism loading. \n12.2.2.5 Randomization. Randomization is the ut,biased assignment of treatments within \na test system and to the exposure chambers ensuring that no treatment is favored and \nthat observations are independent. It is also important to: (1) randomly select the \norganisms (but not the number of organisms) for assignment to the control and test \ntreatments (e.g., a bias in the results may occur if all the largest animals are placed in \nthe same treatment), (2) randomize the allocation of sediment (e.g., not take all the \nsediment in the top of a jar for the control and the bottom for spiking), and (3) \nrandomize the location of exposure units. \n12.2.2.6 Pseudoreplication. The appropriate assignment of treatments to the replicate \nexposure chambers is critical to the avoidance of a common error in design and analysis \ntermed \u201cpseudoreplication\u201d (Hurlbert, 1984). Pseudoreplication occurs when inferential \nstatistics are used to test for treatment effects even though the treatments are not \nreplicated or the replicates are not statistically independent (Hurlbert, 1984). The \nsimplest form of pseudoreplication is the treatment of subsamples of the experimental \nunit as true replicates. For example, two aquaria are prepared, one with control \nsediment, the other with test sediment, and 10 organisms are placed in each aquarium. \nEven if each organism is analyzed individually, the 10 organisms only replicate the \nbiological response and do not replicate the treatment (i.e., sediment type). In this case, \nthe experimental unit is the 10 organisms and each organism is a subsample. A less \nobvious form of pseudoreplication is the potential systematic error due to the physical \nsegregation of exposure chambers by treatment. For example, if all the control exposure \nchambers are placed in one area of a room and all the test exposure chambers are in \nanother, spatial effects (e.g., different lighting, temperature) could bias the results for \none set of treatments. Random physical intermixing of the exposure chambers or \nrandomization of treatment location may be necessary to avoid this type of \npseudoreplication. Pseudoreplication can be avoided or reduced by properly identifying \nthe experimental unit, providing replicate experimental units for each treatment, and \napplying the treatments to each experimental unit in a manner that includes random \nphysical intermixing (interspersion) and independence. However, avoiding \npseudoreplication completely may be difficult or impossible given resource constraints. \n12.2.3 The purpose of a toxicity test is to determine if the biological response to a \ntreatment sample differs from the response to a control sample. Table 12.1 presents the \npossible outcomes and decisions that can be reached in a statistical test of such a \nhypothesis. The null hypothesis is that no difference exists among the mean control and \ntreatment responses. The alternative hypothesis of greatest interest in sediment tests is \nthat the treatments are toxic, or contain concentrations of bioaccumulable compounds, \nreIative to the control or reference sediment. \n12.2.3.1 Statistical tests of hypotheses can be designed to control for the chances of \nmaking incorrect decisions. In Table 12.1, alpha (CL) represents the probability of \nmaking a Type 1 statistical error. A Type I statistical error in this testing situation \nresults from the false conclusion that the treated sample is toxic or contains chemical \nresidues not found in the control or reference sample. Beta (p) represents the \nprobability of making a Type II statistical error, or the likelihood that one erroneously \nconcludes there are no differences among the mean responses in the treatment, control \nor reference samples. Traditionally, acceptable values for a have ranged from 0.1 to \n0.01 with 0.05 or 5% used most commonly. This choice should depend upon the \nconsequences of making a Type I error. Historically, having chosen a, environmental \nresearchers have ignored p and the associated power of the test (l-p). \n12.2.3.2 Fait-weather (1991) presents a review of the need for, and the practical \nimplications of, conducting power analysis in environmental monitoring studies. This \nreview also includes a comprehensive bibliography of recent publications on the need \nfor, and use of, power analyses in environmental study design and data analysis. The \nconsequences of a Type 11 statistical error in environmental studies should never be \nignored and may in fact be the most important criteria to consider in experimental \ndesigns and data analyses which include statistical hypothesis testing. To paraphrase \nFait-weather (IuSl), \u201cThe commitment of time, energy and people to a false positive (a \nType I error) will only continue until the mistake is discovered. In contrast, the cost of \na false negative (a Type II error) will have both short- and long-term costs (e.g., ensuing \nenvironmental degradation and the eventual cost of its rectification).\u201d \n12.2.3.3 The criticaI components of the experimental design associated with the test of \nhypothesis outlined above are: (1) the required MDD between the treatment and control \nor reference responses, (2) the variance among treatment and control replicate \nexperimental units, (3) the number of replicate units for the treatment and control \nsamples, (4) the number of animals exposed within a replicate exposure chamber, and \n(5) the selected probabilities of Type I (~a) and Type II (p) errors. \nTable 12.1 Suggested a levels to use for tests of assumptions \nTest \nNormality \nEquality of \nVariances Number of \nObservations\u2019 \nN=2to9 \nN = 10 to 19 \nN = 20 or more \nn=2to9 \nn= 10 or more a When Design Is \nBalanced Unbalanced\u2019 \n0.10 0.25 \n0.05 0.10 \n0.01 0.05 \n0.10 0.25 \n0.05 0.10 \n1 N = total number of observations (replicates) in al1 treatments combined; n = \nnumber of observations (replicates) in an individual treatment \n2 n mxclx22nmin \n87 \n12.2.3.4 Sample size or number of replicates may be Fixed due to cost or space \nconsiderations, or may be varied to achieve a priori probabilities of a and p. The MDD \nshould be established ahead of time based upon biological and program considerations. \nThe investigator has little control of the variance among replicate exposure chambers. \nHowever, this variance component can be minimized by selecting test organisms that are \nas biologically similar as possible and maintaining test conditions within prescribed \nquality control (QC) limits. \n12.2.3.5 The MDD is expressed as a percentage change from the mean control response. \nTo test the equality of the control and treatment responses, a two-sample t-test with its \nassociated assumptions is the appropriate parametric analysis. If the desired MDD, the \nnumber of replicates per treatment, the number of organisms per replicate and an \nestimate of typical among replicate variability, such as the coefficient of variation (CV) \nfrom a control sample, are available, it is possible to use a graphical approach as in \nFigure 12.1 to determine how likely it is that a 20% reduction will be detected in the \ntreatment response relative to the control response. The CV is defined as 100% x \n(standard deviation divided by the mean). In a test design with 8 replicates per \ntreatment and with an a level of 0.05. high power (i.e., 9.80) to detect a 20% reduction \nfrom the control mean occurs only if the CV is 15% or less (Figure 12.1). The choice of \nthese variables also affects the power of the test. If 5 replicates are used per treatment \n(Figure 12.21, the CV needs to be 10% or lower to detect a 20% reduction in response \nrelative to the control mean with a power of 90%. \n12.2.3.1, Relaxing the a level of a statistical test increases the power of the test. \nFigure 12.3 duplicates Figure 12.1 except that o! is 0.10 instead of 0.05. Selection of the \nappropriate a level of a test is a function of the costs associated with making Type I and \nII statistical errors. Evaluation of Figure 12.1 illustrates that with a CV of 15% and an \na level of 0.05, there is an 80% probability (power) of detecting a 20% reduction in the \nmean treatment response relative to the control mean. However, if a is set at 0.10 \n(Figure 12.3) and the CV remains at lS%, then there is a 90% probability (power) of \ndetecting a 20% reduction relative to the control mean. The latter example would be \npreferable if an environmentally conservative analysis and interpretation of the data is \ndesirable. \n12.2.3.7 Increasing the number of replicates per treatment will increase the power to \ndetect a 20% reduction in treatment response relative to the control mean (Figure 12.4). \nNote. however, that for less than X replicates per treatment it is difficult to have high \npower (i.e., A.80) unless the CV is less than 15%. If space or cost limit the number of \nreplicates to fewer than 8 per treatment, then it may be necessary to find ways to reduce \nthe among replicate variability and consequently the 0\u2019. Options that are available \ninclude selecting more uniform organisms to reduce biological variability or increasing \nthe a level of the test. For CVs in the range of 30% to 40%. even eight replicates per \ntreatment is inadequate to detect small reductions (a()%) in response relative to the \ncontrol mean. \nDECISION \nTR = Control \nTR > Control TR = Control TR > Control \nCorrect \nI -a Type II \nError \nP \nType 1 \nError \na Correct \n1-P \n(Power) J \nNOTE: Treatment response (TR), alpha (cx) represents the \nprobability of making a Type I statistical error (false positive); beta \n(p) represents the probability of making a Type II statistical error \n(false negative). \nFigure 12.1 Treatment response for a Type 1 and Type II error. \n\u2018i / \nI \n0.9 ; \nI I \n0.8 + \n0.7 -- \n0.6 -- \n5 8 0.5 -- \n0.4 t \n0.3 \nr \n0.2 7 \n! \nI \n0 ! , \n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 \n% Reduction of Control Mean \nFigure 12.2 Power of the test vs percent reduction in treatment response relative to \nthe control mean at various CV\u2019s (8 replicates, alpha = 0.05 (one-tailed)). \nYo \n0.8 \n0.7 \n0.6 \n$ \n3 0.5 \na0 \n0.4 \n0.3 \n0.2 \n0.1 \n0 \n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 \n% Reduction of Control Mean \nFigure 12.3 Power of the test vs percent reduction in treatment response relative to \nthe control mean at various CV\u2019s (5 replic#es, alpha = 0.05 (one-tailed)). \n91 \n0.6 -- \ng 0.5 -- \na\u201d \n0.4 -- \n0.3 -- \n0.2 -- \n0 !

An a of 0.10 therefore establishes a j3 \nof 0.15 In Figure 12.5, if a = p = 0.125, the number of replicates required to detect a \ndifference of 20% relative to the control is at a minimum. As a or j3 decrease, the \nnumber of replicates required to detect the same 20% difference relative to the control \nincreases. However, the curves are relatively flat over the range of 0.05 to 0.20 and that \nthe curves are very dependent upon the choice of the combined total of a + p. Limiting \nthe total of a + /3 to 0.10 greatly increases the number of replicates necessary to detect a \npre-selected percentage reduction in mean treatment response relative to the control \nmean. \n12.2.4 Figure 12.6 outlines a decision tree for analysis of survival and growth data \nsubjected to hypothesis testing. In the tests described herein, samples or observations \nrefer to replicates of treatments. Sample size n is the number of replicates (i.e., \nexposure chambers) in an individual treatment, not the number of organisms in an \nexposure chamber. Overall sample size N is the combined total number of replicates in \nall treatments. The statistical methods discussed in this section are described in general \nstatistics texts such as Steel and Torrie (1980), Sokal and Rohlf (1981), Dixon and \nMassey (1983), Zar (1984), and Snedecor and Cochran (1989). It is recommended that \nusers of this manual have at least one of these texts and associated statistical tables on \nhand. A non-parametric statistics text such as Conover (1980) may also he helpful. \n12.2.4.1 Mean. The sample mean (Z) is the average value, or Xx,/n, where: \nn = number of observations (replicates) \nxi = ith observation \nCXi = every x summed = x, + x2 + x3 + . . . + x, \n12.2.4.2 Standard Deviation. The sample standard deviation (s) is a measure of the \nvariation of the data around the mean and is equivalent to fs\u2019. The sample variance, s2, \nis given by the following \u201cmachine\u201d or \u201ccalculation\u201d formula: \ns2 _ zx2 - (Ex)2/n \nn-l \n12.2.4.3 Standard Error of the Mean. The standard error of the mean (SE, or s/m) \nestimates variation among sample means rather than among individual values. The SE \nis an estimate of the SD among means that would be obtained from several samples of n \nobservations each. Most of the statistical tests in this manual compare means with other \nmeans (e.g., dredged sediment mean with reference mean) or with a fixed standard (e.g., \nFDA action level; Lee et al., 1994). Therefore, the \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201crandom\u201d variation of \nsample means (estimated by SE), rather than the variation among individual obser- \nvations (estimated by s), is required for the tests. \n93 \n0.8 \n0.6 \n4 6 8 IO \nNo. of Replicates (n) 12 14 16 \nFigure 12.5 Effect of CV and number of replicates on the power to detect a 20% \ndecrease in treatment response relative to tie controt mean (alpha = 0.05 \n(One-tailed)). \n94 \n16 \n6 \nAlpha (Beta= 0.25Alpha) \nFigure 12.6 Effect of alpha and beta on the number of replicates at various W\u2019s \n(assuming combined alpha + beta = 0.25). \n95 \n12.2.4.4 Tests of Assumptions. In general, parametric statistical analyses such as t-tests \nand analysis of variance are appropriate only if: (1) there are independent, replicate \nexperimental units for each treatment, (2) the observations within each treatment follow \na normal distribution, and (3) variances for both treatments are equal or similar. The \nfirst assumption is an essential component of experimental design. The second and third \nassumptions can be tested using the data obtained from the experiment. Therefore, \nbefore conducting statistical analyses. tests for normality and equality of variances \nshould be performed. \n12.2.4.4.1 Outliers (extreme values) and systematic departures from a normal \ndistribution (e.g., a log-normal distribution) are the most common causes of departures \nfrom normality or equality of variances. An outlier is an inconsistent or questionable \ndata point that appears unrepresentative of the general trend exhibited by the majority \nof the data. Outliers may be detected by tabulation of the data, plotting, or by analysis \nof residuals. An explanation should be sought for any questionable data points. \nWithout an explanation, data points should only be discarded with extreme caution. If \nthere is no explanation, the analysis should be performed both with and without the \noutlier, and the results of both analyses should be reported. An appropriate \ntransformation, such as the arcsine square root transformation, will normalize many \ndistributions (USEP.4, 1985). Prohlems with outliers can usually be solved only by using \nnon-parametric tests, but careful laboratory practices can reduce the frequency of \noutliers. \n12.2.4.4.2 Tests for A\u2019ornmlit_v. The most commonly used test for normality for small \nsample sizes (N&l) is the Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s Test. This test determines if residuals are \nnormally distributed. Residuals are the differences between individual observations and \nthe treatment mean. Residuals, rather than raw observations, are tested because \nsubtracting the treatment mean removes any differences among treatments This scales \nthe observations so that the mean of residuals for each treatment and over all \ntreatments is zero. The Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s Test provides a test statistic W, which is \ncompared to values of W expected from a normal distribution. W will generally vary \nbetween 0.3 and 1.0, with lower values indicating greater departure from normality. \nBecause normality is desired, one looks for a high value of W with an associated \nprobability greater than the pre-specified cx level. \n12.2.4.4.3 Table 12.2 provides a levels to determine whether departures from normality \nare significant. Normality should be rejected when the probability associated with W \n(or other normality test statistic) is less than a for the appropriate total number of \nreplicates (N) and design. A balanced design means that all treatments have an equal \nnumber (n) of replicate exposure chambers. \u20184 design is considered unbalanced when \nthe treatment with the largest number of replicates (n,,,J has at least twice as many \nreplicates as the treatment with the fewest replicates (n,,,,). Note that higher CI levels are \nused when the number of replicates is snlall, or when the design is unbalanced, because \nthese are the cases in which departures from normality have the greatest effects on t- \ntests and other parametric comparisons. If data fail the test for normality, even after \ntransformation, nonparametric tests should be used for additional analyses. \n12.2.4.4.4 Tables of quantiles of W can be found in Shapiro and Wilk (1965), Gill \n(1978), Conover (1980), USEPA (1989) and other statistical texts. These references also \nprovide methods of calculating W, although the calculations can be tedious. For that \nreason, commonly available computer programs or statistical packages are preferred for \nthe calculation of W. \n12.2.4.4.5 Tests for Homogeneity of Variances. There are a number of tests for equality \nof variances. Some of these tests are sensitive to departures from normality, which is \nwhy a test for normality should be performed first. Bartlett\u2019s Test or other tests such as \nLevene\u2019s Test or Cochran\u2019s Test (Winer, 1971; Snedecor and Cochran, 1989) all have \nsimilar power for small, equal sample sizes (n=5) (Conover et al., 1981), and any one of \nthese tests is adequate for the analyses in this section. Many software packages for t- \ntests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) provide at least one of the tests. Bartlett\u2019s Test \nis recommended for routine evaluation of homogeneity of variances (USEPA, 1985; \nIJSEPA, 1994b; USEPA, 1994~). \n12.2.4.4.6 If no tests for equality of variances are included in the available statistical \nsoftware, Hartley\u2019s F,, can easily be calculated: \nF mu = ( larger of sf , si )/( smaller of si , si ) \nWhen F,, is large, the hypothesis of equal variances is more likely to be rejected. F,, \nis a two-tailed test because it does not matter which variance is expected to be larger. \nSome statistical texts provide critical values of F,,, ( Winer, 1971; Gill, 1978; Rohlf and \nSokal, 1981). \n12.2.4.4.7 Levels of (x for tests of equality of variances are provided in Table 12.2. \nThese levels depend upon number of replicates in a treatment (n) and allotment of \nreplicates among treatments. Relatively high a\u2019s (i.e., 20.10) are recommended because \nthe power of the above tests for equality of variances is rather low (,about 0.3) when n is \nsmall. Equality of variances is rejected if the probability associated with the test \nstatistic is less than the appropriate cc. \n12.2.4.4 Transfhmations c~f the Data When the assumptions of normality or \nhomogeneity of variance are not met, transformations of the data may remedy the \nproblem, so that the data can be analyzed by parametric procedures, rather than by a \nnonparametric technique. The first step in these analyses is to transform the responses, \nexpressed as the proportion surviving, by the arcsine-square root transformation. The \narcsine-square root transformation is commonly used on proportionality data to stabilize \nthe variance and satisfy the normality requirement. If the data do not meet the \nassumption of normality and there are four or more replicates per group, then the \nnonparametric test, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, can be used to analyze the data. If the \ndata meet the assumption of normality, Bartlett\u2019s Test or Hartley\u2019s F test for equality of \nvariances is used to test the homogeneity of variance assumption. Failure of the \nhomogeneity of variance assumption leads to the use of a modified t test and the degrees \nof freedom for the test are adjusted. \n97 \n12.2.4.5.1 The arcsine-square root transformation consists of determining the angle (in \nradians) represented by a sine value. fn this transformation, the proportion surviving is \ntaken as the sine value, the square root of the sine value is calculated, and the angle (in \nradians) for the square root of the sine value is determined. When the proportion \nsurviving is 0 or I, a special modification of the transformation should be used (Bartlett, \n1937). An example of the arcsine-square root transformation and modification are \nprovided below. \n1. Calculate the response proportion (RP) for each replicate within a group, where: \nRP = (number of surviving organisms)/(number exposed) \n2, Transform each RP to arcsine, as follows. \na.

The true population mean (p) and standard \ndeviation (0) are known only after sampling the entire population. In most cases \nsamples are taken randomly from the population, and the s calculated from those \nsamples is only an estimate of CL Student\u2019s t-values account for this uncertainty. The \ndegrees of freedom for the test, which are defined as the sample size minus one (n-l), \nshould be used to obtain the correct t-value. Student t-values decrease with increasing \nsample size because larger samples provide a more precise estimate of u and D. \n12.2.4.6.1 When using a t table, it is crucial to determine whether the table is based on \none-tailed probabilities or two-tailed probabilities. In formulating a statistical \nhypothesis, the alternative hypothesis can be one-sided (one-tailed test) or two-sided \n(two-tailed test). The null hypothesis (H,) is always that the two values being analyzed \nare equal. A one-sided alternative hypothesis (H.J is that there is a specified relationship \nbetween the two values (e.g., one value is greater than the other) versus a two-sided \nalternative hypothesis (H,) which is that the two values are simply different (i.e., either \n98 \nlarger or smaller). A one-tailed test is used when there is an a priori reason to test for a \nspecific relationship between two means such as the alternative hypothesis that the \ntreatment mortality or tissue residue is greater than the control mortality or tissue \nresidue. In contrast, the two-tailed test is used when the direction of the difference is \nnot important or cannot be assumed before testing. \n12.2.4.6.2 Since control organism mortality or tissue residues and sediment contaminant \nconcentrations are presumed lower than reference or treatment sediment values, \nconducting one-tailed tests is recommended in most cases. For the same number of \nreplicates, one-tailed tests are more likely to detect statistically significant differences \nbetween treatments (e.g., have a greater power). This is a critical consideration when \ndealing with a small number of replicates (such as B/treatment). The other alternative \nfor increasing statistical power is to increase the number of replicates, which increases \nthe cost of the test. \n12.2.4.6.3 There are cases when a one-tailed test is inappropriate. When no a priori \nassumption can be made as to how the values vary in relationship to one another, a two- \ntailed test should be used. An example of an alternative two-sided hypothesis is that the \nreference sediment total organic carbon (TOC) content is different (greater or lesser) \nfrom the control sediment TOC. \n12.2.4.6.4 The t-value for a one-tailed probability may be found in a two-tailed table by \nlooking up t under the column for twice the desired one-tailed probability. For example, \nthe one-tailed t-value for a = 0.05 and df = 20 is 1.725, and is found in a two-tailed table \nusing the column for cc = 0.10. \n12.2.4.7 The usual statistical test for comparing two independent samples is the two- \nsample t-test (Snedecor and Cochran, 1989). The t-statistic for testing the equality of \nmeans x, and xz from two independent samples with n, and n2 replicates and unequal \nvariances is: \nwhere st and si are the sample variances of the two groups. Although the equation \nassumes that the variances of the two groups are unequal, it is equally useful for \nsituations in which the variances of the two groups are equal. This statistic is compared \nwith the Student t distribution with degrees of freedom (df) given by Satterthwaite\u2019s \n(1946) approximation: \nThis formula can result in fractional degrees of freedom, in which case one should round \nthe degree of freedom down to the nearest integer in order to use a t table. Using this \n99 \napproach, the degrees of freedom for this test will be less than the degrees of freedom \nfor a t-test assuming equal variances. If there are unequal numbers of replicates in the \ntreatments, the t-test with Bonferroni\u2019s adjustment can be used for data analysis \n(USEPA, 1994b; USEPA, 1994~). When variances are equal;, an F test for equality is \nunnecessary. \n12.2.4.8 Nonparametric Tests. Tests such as the t-test, which analyze the original or \ntransformed data, and which rely on the properties of the normal distribution, are \nreferred to as parametric tests. Nonparametric tests, which do not require normally \ndistributed data, analyze the ranks of data and generally compare medians rather than \nmeans. The median of a sample is the middle or 50th percentile observation when the \ndata are ranked from smallest to largest. In many cases, nonparametric tests can be \nperformed simply by converting the data to ranks or normalized ranks (rankits) and \nconducting the usual parametric test procedures on the ranks or rankits. \n12.2.4.8.1 Nonparametric tests are useful because of their generality, but have less \nstatistical power than corresponding parametric tests when the parametric test \nassumptions are met. If parametric tests are not appropriate for comparisons because \nthe normality assumption is not met, data should be converted to normalized ranks \n(rankits). Rankits are simply the z-scores expected for the rank in a normal \ndistribution. Thus, using rankits imposes a normal distribution over all the data, \nalthough not necessarily within each treatment. Rankits can be obtained by ranking the \ndata, then converting the ranks to rankits using the following formula: \nwhere z is the normal deviate and N is the total number of observations. Alternatively, \nrankits may be obtained from standard statistical tables such as Rohlf and Sokal (1981). \n12.2.4.8.2 If normalized ranks are calculated, the ranks should be converted to rankits \nusing the formula above. In comparisons involving only two treatments (N = 2), there is \nno need to test assumptions on the rankits or ranks; simply proceed with a one-tailed t- \ntest for unequal variances using the rankits or ranks. \n12.2.4.9 Analysis of Variance (N>2). Some experiments are set up to compare more \nthan one treatment with a control while others may also be interested in comparing the \ntreatments with one another. The basic design of these experiments is the same as for \nexperiments evaluating pairwise comparisons. After the applicable comparisons are \ndetermined, the data must be tested for normality to determine if parametric statistics \nare appropriate and whether the variances of the treatments are equal. If normality of \nthe data and equal variances are established, then an analysis of variance (ANOVA) may \nbe performed to address the hypothesis that all the treatments including the control are \nequal. If normality or equality of variance are not established then transformations of \nthe data may be appropriate or nonparametric statistics can be used to test for equal \nmeans. Tests for normality of the data should be performed on the treatment residuals. \nA residual is defined as the observed value minus the treatment mean, that is, rik = oi, - \n(kth treatment mean). Pooling residuals provides an adequate sample size to test the \ndata for normality. \n12.2.4.9.1 The variances of the treatments should also be tested for equality. Currently \nthere is no easy way to test for equality of the treatment means using analysis of \nvariance if the variances are not equal. In a toxicity test with several treatments, one \ntreatment may have 100% mortality in all of its replicates, or the control treatment may \nhave 100% survival in all of its replicates. These responses result in 0 variance for a \ntreatment which results in a rejection of equality of variance in these cases. No \ntransformation will change this outcome. In this case, the replicate responses for the \ntreatment with 0 variance should be removed before testing for equality of variances. \nOnly those treatments that do not have 0 replicate variance should be used in the \nANOVA to get an estimate of the within treatment variance. After a variance estimate \nis obtained, the means of the treatments with 0 variance may be tested against the other \ntreatment means using the appropriate mean comparison. Equality of variances among \nthe treatments can be evaluated with the Hartley F,, test or Bartlett\u2019s test. The option \nof using nonparametric statistics on the entire set of data is also an alternative. \n12.2.4.9.2 If the data are not normally distributed or the variances among treatments \nare not homogeneous, even after data transformation, nonparametric analyses are \nappropriate. If there are four or more replicates per treatment and the number of \nreplicates per treatment is equal, the data can be analyzed with Steel\u2019s Many-One Rank \ntest. Unequal replication among treatments requires data analysis with the Wilcoxon \nRank Sum test with Bonferroni\u2019s adjustment. Steel\u2019s Many-One Rank test is a \nnonparametric test for comparing treatments with a control. This test is an alternative \nto the Dunnett\u2019s Procedure, and may be applied to data when the normality assumption \nhas not been met. Steel\u2019s test requires equal variances across treatments and the \ncontrol, but is thought to be fairly insensitive to deviations from this condition (USEPA, \n1993a). Wilcoxon\u2019s Rank Sum Tests is a nonparameteric test to be used as an \nalternative to the Steel\u2019s test when the number of replicates are not the same within \neach treatment. A Bonferroni\u2019s adjustment of the pairwise error rate for comparison of \neach treatment versus the control is used to set an upper bound of alpha on the overall \nerror rate. This is in contrast to the Steel\u2019s test with a fixed overall error rate for \nalpha. Thus, Steel\u2019s tests is a more powerful test (USEPA, 1993a). \n12.2.4.9.3 Different mean comparison tests are used depending on whether an a percent \ncomparison-wise error rate or an a percent experiment-wise error rate is desired. The \nchoice of a comparison-wise or experiment-wise error rate depends on whether a \ndecision is based on a pairwise comparison (comparison-wise) or from a set of \ncomparisons (experiment-wise). For example, a comparison-wise error rate would be \nused for deciding which stations along a gradient were acceptable or not acceptable, \nrelative to a control or reference sediment. Each individual comparison is performed \nindependently at a smaller a (than used in an experiment-wise comparison) such that \nthe probability of making a Type I error in the entire series of comparisons is not \ngreater than the chosen experiment-wise a level of the test. This results in a more \nconservative test when comparing any particular sample to the control or reference. \nHowever, if several samples were taken from the same area and the decision to accept or \nreject the area was based upon all comparisons with a reference then an experiment- \nwise error rate should be used. When an experiment-wise error rate is used, the power \nto detect real differences between any two means decreases as a function of the number \nof treatment means being compared to the control treatment. \n12.2.4.9.4 The recommended procedure for pairwise comparisons that have a \ncomparison-wise a error rate and equal replication is to do an ANOVA followed by a \none-sided Fisher\u2019s Least Significant Difference (LSD) test (Steel and Torrie, 1980). A \nDuncan\u2019s mean comparison test should give results similar to the LSD. If the \ntreatments do not contain equal numbers of replicates, the appropriate analysis is the t- \ntest with Bonferroni\u2019s adjustment. For comparisons that maintain an experiment-wise CI \nerror rate Dunnett\u2019s test is recommended for comparisons with the control. \n12.2.4.9.5 Dunnett\u2019s test has an overall error rate of a, which accounts for the multiple \ncomparisons with the control. Dunnett\u2019s procedure uses a pooled estimate of the \nvariance, which is equal to the error value calculated in an ANOVA. Dunnett\u2019s \nprocedure can only be used when the same number of replicate test chambers have been \nused at each treatment and the control. \n12.2.4.9.6 To perform the individual comparisons, calculate the t statistic for each \ntreatment and control combination, as follows: \nwhere ii = Mean for each treatment \nui = Mean for the control \nSW = Square root of the within mean square \nn, = Number of replicates in the control. \nn, = Number of replicates for treatment \u201ci\u201d. \nTo quantify the sensitivity of the Dunnett\u2019s test, the minimum significant difference \nOlSD=MDD) may be calculated with the following formula: \nwhere d = Critical value for the Dunnett\u2019s Procedure \nS, = The square root of the within mean square \n102 \nI1 = The number of replicates per treatment, assuming an equal number of \nreplicates at all treatment concentrations \nn1 = Number of replicates in the control \n12-2.5 Methods for Calculating LCSOs, EGOS, and Kps. \n12.2.5.1 Figure 12.8 outlines a decision tree for analysis of point estimate data. l!SEPA \n(USEPA, 1985; USEPA, 3989b: USEPA. 1994b; USEPA, 1994~) discuss in detail the \nmechanics of calculating LC50 (or EC50) or ICp values using the most current methods. \nThe most commonly used methods are the Graphical, Probit, Trimmed Spearman- \nKarber and the Linear Interpolation Methods. In general, results from these methods \nshould yield similar estimates. Each method is outlined below and recommendations \npresented for the use of each method. \n12.2.5.2 Data for at least five test concentrations and the control should be available to \ncalculate an LC50 although each method can be used with fewer concentrations. \nSurvival in the lowest concentration must be at least 50% and an LC50 should not be \ncalculated unless at least 50% of the organisms die in at least one of the serial dilutions. \nWhen less than 50% mortality occurs in the highest test concentration, fhe LCSO is \nexpressed as greater than the highest test concentration. \n12.2.5.3 Due to the intensive nature of the calculations for the estimated LC50 and \nassociated 95% confidence interval using most of the following methods, it is \nrecommended that the data be analyzed with the aid of computer software. A computer \nprogram to estimate the LCSO values and associated 9S % confidence intervals with the \nmethods discussed below (except for the Graphical Method) was developed by IJSEPX \nand can be obtained by sending a diskette with a written request to USEPA, \nEnvironmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory (EMSL), 26 W. hlartin Luther King \nDrive, Cincinnati, OH 45268 or call 513/569-7076. \n12.2.5.4 The Graphical Method. This procedure estimates an LC5O (or EC50) by \nlinearly interpolating between points of a plot of observed percentage mortality versus \nthe base 10 logarithm (Iog,,,) of treatment concentration. The only requirement for its \nuse is that treatment mortalities bracket 50%. \n12.2.5.4.1 For an analysis using the Graphical Method the data should first be smoothed \nand adjusted for mortality in the control replicates. The procedure for smoothing and \nadjusting the data is detailed in the following steps: Let p,,, p,, . . . . pL( denote the observed \nproportion mortalities for the control and the k treatments. The first step is to smooth \nthe pi if they do not satisfy p,, 5 p1 I . . . < pk. The srnoothing process replaces an) \nadjacent pi\u2019s that do not conform to p,, 5 pI 5 . . . 2 pk with their average. For example, if \npi is less than pi.] then: \nP\u2019 -1 = p: = (p, + vi.1 )/2 \nwhere pi = the smoothed observed proportion mortality for concentration i. \n103 \nTest for Normality \nHomogeneity of Variance \nI Heterogenous Variances 4 \nt \nHomogenous Variances No, N-2 \n)I \n+ Yes, N>2 \n[A\u201dOVa] t \n1 t-Test for Uneuual Variant \nEqual RepScation \n1 + Comparison-Wise Alpha -) \nFisher\u2019s LSD, Duncan\u2019s \nxpenment-Wvlse Alpha \nDunnett\u2019s \nFigure 12.7 Decision tree for analysis survival and growth data subjected to hypothesis \ntesting. \nAdjust the smoothed observed proportion mortality in each treatment for mortality in \nthe control group using Abbott\u2019s formula (Finney, 1071). The adjustment takes the \nform: \np\u2018; = (p; - p;,)N - p:l) \nwhere pi = the smoothed observed proportion mortality for the control \np; = the smoothed observed proportion mortality for concentration i. \n12.255 The Probit Method. The Probit Method is a parametric statistical procedure \nfor estimating the LC50 (or EC50) and the associated OS %- confidence interval (Finnej, \n197X). The analysis consists of transforming the observed proportion mortalities with a \nprobit transformation, and transforming the treatment concentrations to log,,,. Given \nthe assumption of normality for the log,,, of the tolerances, the relationship between the \ntransformed variables mentioned above is about linear. This relationship allows \nestimation of linear regression parameters, using an iterative approach. A probit is the \nsame as a z-score: for example, the probit corresponding to 70% mortality is z,,,, or =.52. \nThe LC50 is calculated from the regression and is the concentration associated with 50% \nmortality or z=O. To obtain a reasonably precise estimate of the LC50 with the Probit \nhlethod, the observed proportion mortalities must bracket 0.5 and the logI,, of the \ntolerance should be normally distributed. To calculate the LC50 estimate and associated \n9ScTr: confidence interval, two or more of the observed proportion mortalities must be \nbetween zero and one. The original percentage mortalities should be corrected for \ncontrol mortality using Abbott\u2019s formula before the Probit transformation is applied to \nthe data. \n12.2.5.5.1 A goodness-of-fit procedure with the Chi-square statistic is used to determine \nif the data fit the Probit model. If many data sets are to be compared to one another, \nthe probit method is not recommended because it may not be appropriate for many of \nthe data sets. This method also is only appropriate for mortality data sets and should \nnot be used for estimating endpoints that are a function of the control response, such as \ninhibition of growth. Most computer programs that generate probit estimates also \ngenerate confidence interval estimates for the LCSO. These confidence interval estimates \non the LC50 may not be correct if replicate mortalities are pooled to obtain a mean \ntreatment response. This can be avoided by entering the probit-transformed replicate \nresponses and doing a least squares regression on the transformed data. \n12.256 The Trimmed Spearman- Karber Method. The Trimmed Spearman-Karber \nMethod is a modification of the Spearman-Karber. non-parametric statistical procedure \nfor estimating the LC50 and the associated OS 9% confidence interval (Hamilton et al.. \n1977). This procedure estimates the trimmed mean of the distribution of the log,,, of the \ntolerance. If the log tolerance distribution is symmetric, this estimate of the trimmed \nmean is equivalent to an estimate of the median of the log tolerance distribution. IIse of \nthe Trimmed Spearman-Karber llethod is only appropriate when the requirements for \nthe Probit hlethod are not met (I\u2019SEPA, lW3b: IISEPA, 1994~). This method is only \nappropriate for tethality data sets. \nI OS \n1 Survival Po; Estimates 1 \nTwo or More Partial Mortalities \nSignificant Chi Square Test One Partial Mortality \nYes \n+ No Yes \nI \ncl Probit \nI i (Graphical] \nI \nI I 1 Linear Interpolation 1 , \nTrimmed Spearman-Karber \nI LC50 and 95% Confidence Intervals \nFigure 12.8 Decision tree for analysis of point estimate data. \n12.2.5.6.1 To calculate the LC50 estimate with the Trimmed Spearman-Karber Method, \nthe smoothed, adjusted, observed proportion mortalities must bracket 0.5. To calculate \na confidence interval for the LCSO estimate, one or more of the smoothed, adjusted, \nobserved proportion mortalities must be between zero and one. \n12.2.5.6.2 Smooth the observed proportion mortalities as described for the Probit \nMethod. Adjust the smoothed observed proportion mortality in each concentration for \nmortality in the control group using Abbott\u2019s formula (see Probit Method). Calculate \nthe amount of trim to use in the estimation of the LC50 as follows: \nTrim = max(py, 1 - pE> \nwhere p: = the smoothed, adjusted proportion mortality for the lowest treatment \nconcentration, exclusive of the control. \nPtt = the smoothed, adjusted proportion mortality for the highest treatment \nconcentration. \nk = the number of treatment concentrations, exclusive of the control. \n12.257 The Linear Interpolation Method. This method calculates a toxicant \nconcentration that causes a given percent reduction (e.g., 25%, 50%, etc.) in the \nendpoint of interest and is reported as an ICp value (IC = Inhibition Concentration; \nwhere p = the percent effect). The procedure was designed for general applicability in \nthe analysis of data from chronic toxicity tests, and the generation of an endpoint from a \ncontinuous model that allows a traditional quantitative assessment of the precision of the \nendpoint, such as confidence limits for the eudpoint of a single test, and a mean and \ncoefficient of variation for the endpoints of multiple tests. \n12.2.5.7.1 As described in USEPA (USEPA, 1994b; USEPA, 1994c), the Linear \nInterpolation Method of calculating an ICp assumes that the responses: (1) are \nmonotonically nonincreasing, where the mean response for each higher concentration is \nless than or equal to the mean response for the previous concentration, (2) follow a \npiecewise linear response function, and (3) are from a random, independent, and \nrepresentative sample of test data. If the data are not monotonically nonincreasing, they \nare adjusted by smoothing (averaging). In cases where the responses at the low toxicant \nconcentrations are much higher than in the controls, the smoothing process may result \nin a large upward adjustment in the control mean. In the Linear Interpolation Method, \nthe smoothed response means are used to obtain the ICp estimate reported for the test. \nNo assumption is made about the distribution of the data except that the data within a \ngroup being resampled are independent and identically distributed. \n12.2.5.7.2 The Linear Interpolation Method assumes a linear response from one \nconcentration to the next. Thus, the IC is estimated by linear interpolation between two \nconcentrations whose responses bracket the response of interest, the (p) percent \nreduction from the control. \n107 \n12.2.5.7.3 If the assumption of monotonicity of test results is met, the observed response \nmeans (Y,) should stay the same or decrease as the toxicant concentration increases. If \nthe means do not decrease monotonically, the responses are \u201csmoothed\u201d by averaging \n( pooling j adjacent means. Observed means at each concentration a_re considered in \norder of increasing concentration, starting with the control mean (Y,). If the mean \nobserved response ,at the lowest toxicant concentration (Y,) is equal to or smaller than \nthe control mean (Y,), it is used as the response. If it is larger than the control mean, it \nis averaged with the control, and this average is used for both the control response (M,) \nand the lowest toxicant concentration response (M2). This mean is t&en compared to the \nmean observed response for the next higher toxicant concentration (Y3). Again, if the \nmean observed response for the next higher toxicant concentration is smaller than the \nmean of the control and the lowest toxicant concentration, it is used as the response. If \nit is higher than the mean of the first two, it is averaged with the first two, and the \nmean is used as the response for the control and two lowest concentrations of toxicant. \nThis process is continued for data from the remaining toxicant concentrations. Unusual \npatterns in the devia&ons from monotonicity may require an additional step of \nsmoothing. Where Yi decrease monotonically, the Yi become Mi without smoothing. \n12.2.5.7.4 To obtain the ICp estimate, determine the concentrations C, and C,+, which \nbracket the response M, (1 - p/100), where M, is the smoothed control mean response \nand p is the percent reduction in response relative to the control response. These \ncalculations can easily be done by hand or with a computer program as described below. \nThe linear interpolation estimate is caIculated as follows: \nrep = CJ + [ Ml (1 - p/loo) - Ad, ] (CJ + 1 - C,) \n(4 + 1 - MJ) \nwhere C, = tested concentration whose observed mean response is greater than \nM,(l - p/100). \nC J+l = tested concentration whose observed mean response is less than M,(l - \np/10(1). \nw = smoothed mean response for the control. \nMJ = smoothed mean response for concentration J. \n%I, + 1 = smoothed mean response for concentration J + 1. \nP = percent reduction in response relative to the control response. \nICP = estimated concentration at which there is a percent reduction from the \nsmoothed mean control response. \n12.2.5.7.5 Standard statistical methods for calculating confidence intervals are not \napplicable for the ICp. The bootstrap method, as proposed by Efron (1982), is used to \nobtain the 95% confidence interval for the true mean. In the bootstrap method, the test \ndata Yji is randomly resampled with replacement to produce a new set of data Yji*, that \nis statistically equivalent to the original data, but which produces a new and slightly \ndifferent estimate of the ICp (IQ*). This process is repeated at least 80 times (Marcus \nand Holtzman, 1988) resulting in multiple \u201cdata\u201d sets, each with an associated ICp* \nestimate. The distribution of the ICp* estimates derived from the sets of resampled data \napproximates the sampling distribution of the ICp estimate. The standard error of the \nICp is estimated by the standard deviation of the individual ICp* estimates. Empirical \nconfidence intervals are derived from the quantiles of the ICp* empirical distribution. \nFor example, if the test data are resampled a minimum of 80 time, the empirical 2.5% \nand the 97.5% confidence limits are about the second smallest and second largest lCp* \nestimates (Marcus and Holtzman, 1988). The width of the confidence intervals \ncalculated by the bootstrap method is related to the variability of the data. When \nconfidence intervals are wide, the reliability of the IC estimate is in question. However. \nnarrow intervals do not necessarily indicate that the estimate is highly reliable, because \nof undetected violations of assumptions and the fact that the confidence limits based on \nthe empirical quantiles of a bootstrap distribution of 80 samples may be unstable. \n123 Data Intmpretation \n14.3.1 Sediments spiked with known concentrations of contaminants can be used to \nestablish cause and effect relationships between chemicals and biological responses. \nResults of toxicity tests with test materials spiked into sediments at different \nconcentrations may be reported in terms of an LC50 (median lethal concentration), an \nEC50 (median effect concentration), an IC5O (inhibition concentration), or as an NOEC \n(no observed effect concentration) or LOEC (lowest observed effect concentration: \nSection 3). Consistent spiking procedures should be followed in order to make \ninterlaboratory comparisons (Section 8.3). \n12.3.2 Evaluating effect concentrations for chemicals in sediment requires knowledge of \nfactors controlling the bioavailability. Similar concentrations of a chemical in units of \nmass of chemical per mass of sediment dry weight often exhibit a range in toxicity in \ndifferent sediments (Di Toro et al., 1991; USEPA, 1992~). Effect concentrations of \nchemicals in sediment have been correlated to interstitial water concentrations, and \neffect concentrations in interstitial water are often similar to effect concentrations in \nwater-only exposures. The bioavailability of non-ionic organic compounds are often \ninversely correlated with the organic carbon concentration of the sediment. Whatever \nthe route of exposure, the correlations of effect concentrations to interstitial water \nconcentrations indicate predicted or measured concentrations in interstitial water can be \nuseful for quantifying the exposure concentration to an organism. Therefore, \ninformation on partitioning of chemicals between solid and liquid phases of sediment \nmay be useful for establishing effect concentrations. \n12.3.3 Toxic units can be used to help interpret the response of organisms to multiple \ncontaminants in sediment. A toxic unit is the concentration of a chemical divided by an \neffect concentration. For example, a toxic unit of exposure can be calculated by dividing \nthe measured concentration of a chemical in pore water by the water-only LC50 for the \nsame chemical (Ankley et al., 1991a). Toxicity expressed as toxic units may be summed \nand this may provide information on the toxicity of chemical mixtures (Ankley et al., \n1991a). \n12.3.4 Field surveys can be designed to provide either a qualitative reconnaissance of \nthe distribution of sediment contamination or a quantitative statistical comparison of \ncontamination among sites (Burton and Ingersoll, 1994). Surveys of sediment toxicity \nare usually part of more comprehensive analyses of biological, chemical, geological, and \nhydrographic data. Statistical correlation can be improved and costs reduced if \nsubsamples are taken simultaneously for sediment toxicity or bioaccumulation tests, \nchemical analyses, and benthic community structure. \n12.3.5 Descriptive methods such as toxicity tests with field-collected sediment should not \nbe used alone to evaluate sediment contamination. An integration of several methods \nusing the weight of evidence is needed to assess the effects of contaminants associated \nwith sediment. Hazard evaluations integrating data from laboratory exposures, chemical \nanalyses, and benthic community assessments provide strong complementary evidence of \nthe degree of pollution-induced degradation in aquatic communities (Chapman et al., \n1992; Burton, 1991). \n12.3.6 Toxicity Idcrrtiftcation Evaluation (TIE) procedures can be used to help provide \ninsights as to specific contaminants responsible for toxicity in sediment (USEPA, Wla; \nAnkley and Thomas, 1992). For example, the toxicity of contaminants such as metals, \nammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and non-ionic organic compounds can be identified using \nTIE procedures. \n12.4 Reporting \n12.4.1 The record of the results of an acceptable sediment test should include the \nfollowing information either directly or by referencing available documents: \n12.4.1.1 Name of test and investigator(s), name and location of laboratory, and dates of \nstart and end of test. \n12.4.1.2 Source of control or test sediment, method for collection, handling, shipping, \nstorage and disposal of sediment. \n12.4.1.3 Source of test material, lot number if applicable, composition (identities and \nconcentrations of major ingredients and impurities if known), known chemical and \nphysical properties, and the identity and concentration(s) of any solvent used. \n12.4.1.4 Source and characteristics of overlying water, description of any pretreatment, \nand results of any demonstration of the ability of an organism to survive or grow in the \nwater. \n12.4.1.5 Source, history and age of test organisms; source, history and age of brood \nstock, culture procedures; and source and date of collection of the test organisms, \n110 \nscientific name, name of person who identified the organisms and the taxonomic key \nused, age or life stage, means and ranges of weight or length, observed diseases or \nunusual appearance, treatments, holding procedures. \n12.4.1.6 Source and composition of food, concentrations of test material and other \ncontaminants, procedure used to prepare food, feeding methods, frequency and ration. \n12.4.1.7 Description of the experimental design and test chambers, the depth and \nvolume of sediment and overlying water in the chambers, lighting, number of test \nchambers and number of test organisms/treatment, date and time test starts and ends. \ntemperature measurements, dissolved oxygen concentration (as percent saturation) and \nany aeration used before starting a test and during the conduct of a test. \n12.4.1.8 Methods used for physical and chemical characterization of sediment. \n12.4.1.9 Definition(s) of the effects used to calculate LC50 or ECSOs, biological \nendpoints for tests, and a summary of general observations of other effects. \n12.4.1.10 A table of the biological data for each test chamber for each treatment \nincluding the control(s) in sufficient detail to allow independent statistical analysis. \n12.4.1.11 Methods used for statistical analyses of data. \n12.4.1.12 Summary of general observations on other effects or symptoms. \n12.4.1.13 Anything unusual about the test, any deviation from these procedures, and \nany other relevant information. \n12.4.2 Published reports should contain enough information to clearly identify the \nmethodology used and the quality of the results. \nIll \nSection 13 \nPrecision and Accuracy \n13.1 Determining Precision and Accuracy \n13.1.1 Precision is a term that describes the degree to which data generated from \nreplicate measurements differ and reflects the closeness of agreement between randomly \nselected test results. Accuracy is the difference between the value of the measured data \nand the true value and is the closeness of agreement between an observed value and an \naccepted reference value. Quantitative determination of precision and accuracy in \nsediment testing of aquatic organisms is difficult or may be impossible in some cases, as \ncompared to analytical (chemical) determinations. This is due, in part, to the many \nunknown variables which affect organism response. Determining the accuracy of a \nsediment test using field samples is not possible since the true values are not known. \nSince there is no acceptable reference material suitable for determining the accuracy of \nsediment tests. accuracy of the test methods has not been determined (Section 13.2). \n13.1.2 Sediment tests exhibit variability due to several factors (Section 9). Test \nvariability can be described in terms of two types of precision either single laboratory \n(intralaboratory or repeatability; Section 13.5.1) precision or multi-laboratory \n(interlaboratory or reproducibility: Section 13.5.2) precision. Intralaboratory precision \nreflects the ability of\u2019 trained laboratory personnel to obtain consistent results repeatedly \nwhen performing the same test on the same organism using the same toxicant. \nInterlaboratory precision (also referred to as round-robin or ring tests) is a measure of \nhow reproducible a method is when conducted by a large number of laboratories using \nthe same method. organism. and samples. Generally, intralaboratory results are less \nvariable than interlaboratory results (USEPA, 1991b; USEPA. 1993a: USEPA, 1994b; \nUSEPA. 1994c: hall et al., 1989: Grothe and Kimerle, 1985). \n13.1.3 A measure of precision can be calculated using the mean and relative standard \ndeviation (percent coefficient of variation, or CV% = standard deviation/mean x 100) of \nthe calculated endpoints from the replicated endpoints of a test. However, precision \nreported as the CV should not be the only approach used for evaluating precision of \ntests and should not be used for the NOEC effect levels derived from statistical analyses \nof hypothesis testing. The CVs may be very high when testing extremely toxic samples. \nFor example, if there are multiple replicates with no survival and one with low survival \nthe CV may exceed 100% yet the range of response is actually quite consistent. \nTherefore, additional estimates of precision should be used, such as range of responses \nand minimum detectable differences (MDD) compared to control survival or growth. \nSeveral factors can affect the precision of the test, including test organism age, condition, \nsensitivity, handling of the test organisms, overlying water quality, and the experience of \nthe investigators in conducting tests. For these reasons, it is recommended that trained \nlaboratory personnel conduct the tests in accordance with the procedures outlined in \nSection 9. Quality assurance practices should include: (1) single laboratory precision \ndeterminations using reference toxicants for each of the test organisms which are used to \ndetermine the ability of the laboratory personnel to obtain precise results--these \ndeterminations should be made before conducting a sediment test and should be \n112 \nroutinely performed as long as whole sediment tests are being conducted; (2) control \ncharts (Section 13.3) should be prepared for each reference toxicant and test organism to \ndetermine if the test results are within prescribed limits; and (3) tests must meet the \nminimum criteria of test acceptability specific for each test organism (Table 11.3: \nUSEPA, 1991b). \n13.1.4 Intralaboratory precision data are routinely calculated for test organisms using \nwater-only 96-h exposures to a reference toxicant, such as CdCI,. Intralaboratory \nprecision data should be tracked using a control chart. Each laboratory\u2019s reference \ntoxicant data will reflect conditions unique to that facility, including dilution water. \nculturing, and other variables (Section 9). However, each laboratory\u2019s reference toxicant \nCVs should reflect good repeatability. \n13.1.5 To date, two interlaboratory precision (round-robin) tests have been completed \nusing 10-d whole sediment tests, one with Rhepoxynius abronius (Mearns et al., 1986). \nand the other with Arnpelisca abdita, Eohaustorius estuarius, and Leprocheirus plunwlosus \n(C. Schlekat, SAIC, Narragansett, RI, unpublished data). The results of these round- \nrobin study are described in Section 13.51. \n13.2 Accuracy \n13.2.1 The accuracy of toxicity tests cannot be determined since there is no acceptable \nreference material. The relative accuracy of the reference toxicity tests can only be \nevaluated by comparing test responses to control charts. \n13.3 Replication and Test Sensitivity \n13.3.1 The sensitivity of sediment tests will depend in part on the number of replicates \nper concentration, the probability levels (alpha and beta) selected, and the type of \nstatistical analysis. For a given level of variability, the sensitivity of the test will increase \nas the number of replicates is increased. The minimum recommended number of \nreplicates varies with the objectives of the test and the statistical method used for \nanalysis of the data (Section 12). \n13.4 Demonstrating Acceptable Laboratory Performance \n13.41 It is the responsibility of a laboratory to demonstrate its ability to obtain precise \nresults with reference toxicants before it performs sediment tests (Section 9.16). \nIntralaboratory precision, expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV), of the range for \neach type of test to be used in a laboratory should be determined by performing five or \nmore tests with different batches of test organisms, using the same reference toxicant. at \nthe same concentrations, with the same test conditions (e.g.. the same test duration, type \nof water, age of test organisms, feeding). and same data analysis methods. This should \nbe done to gain experience for the toxicity tests and a point of reference for future \ntesting. A reference toxicant concentration series (0.5 or higher) should be selected that \nwill consistently provide partial mortalities at two or more concentrations of the test \nchemical (Section 9.14, Table 9.1). \n113 \n13.4.2 The quality of test organisms obtained from an outside source, regardless of \nwhether they are from culture or collected from the tield, must be verified by \nconducting a reference-toxicity test concurrently with the sediment test. For cultured \norganisms. the supplier should provide data with the shipment describing the history of \nthe sensitivity of organisms from the same source culture. For field-collected organisms, \nthe supplier should provide data with the shipment describing the collection location. the \nwater salinity and temperature at the time of collection, and collection site sediment for \nholding and acclimation purposes. If the supplier has not conducted five reference \ntoxicity tests with the test organism, it is the responsibility of the testing laboratory to \nconduct these five reference toxicity tests before starting a sediment test (Section 13.4.2). \n13.4.3 Before conducting tests with contaminated sediment, the laboratory should \ndemonstrate its ability to conduct tests by conducting five exposures in control sediment \nas outlined in Table 11.1. It is recommended that these five exposures with control \nsediment be conducted concurrently with the five reference toxicity tests described in \nSection \u20181.14.1. \n13.4.J A control chart should be prepared for each combination of reference toxicant \nand test organism. Endpoints from five tests are adequate for establishing the control \ncharts. III this technique, a running plot is maintained for the values (Xi) from \nsuccessive tests with a given reference toxicant (Figure 13.1), and the endpoint (LCW, \nSOEC. Ic\u2019p) are examined to determine if they are within prescribed limits. Control \ncharts as described in USEPA (lYY4a) and USEPA (lYY4b) are used to evaluate the \ncumulative trend of results from a series of samples. The mean and upper and lower \ncontrol limits (*2 SD) are re-calculated with each successive test result. After two years \nof data collection, or a minimum of 20 data points, the control chart should be \nmaintained using only the 20 most recent data points. \n13.J.5 The outliers, which are values falling outside the upper and lower control limits, \nand trends of increasing or decreasing sensitivity, are readily identified using control \ncharts. W\u2019ith an alpha of 0.05, one in 20 tests would be expected to fall outside of the \ncontrol limits by chance alone. During a 30 d period, if two reference toxicity tests out \nof total previous 20 fall outside the control limits, the sediment toxicity tests conducted \nduring the that time in which the second reference toxicity test failed are suspect, and \nshould be considered as provisional and subject to careful review. \n13.451 .A sediment test may be acceptable if specified conditions of a reference toxicant \ntest full outside the expected ranges (Section Y). Specifically, a sediment test should not \nautcunatically be judged unacceptable if the LC50 for a given reference toxicity test falls \noutside the expected rage or if mortality in the control of the reference toxicity test \nexceeds 111%. All the performance criteria outlined in Table 11.3 must be considered \nNIWII determining the acceptability of a sediment test. The acceptability of the sediment \ntest would depend on the experience and judgement of the investigator and the \nrc@rtory authority. \n13-M If ttw value from a given test with the reference toxicant falls more than two \nhumdard deviation (SD) outside the expected range, the sensitivity of the organisms and \n114 \nthe overall credibility of the test system are suspect (USEPA, 1993a). In this case, the \ntest procedure should be examined for defects and should be repeated with a different \nbatch of test organisms. \n13.4.7 Performance should improve with experience, and the control limits for point \nestimates should gradually narrow. However, control limits of k2 SD, by definition, will \nbe exceeded 5% of the time, regardless of how well a laboratory performs. Highly \nproficient laboratories which develop a very narrow control limit may be unfairly \npenalized if a test which falls just outside the control limits is rejected defacto. For this \nreason, the width of the control limits should be considered in determining whether or \nnot an outlier is to be rejected. This determination may be made by the regulatory \nauthority evaluating the data. \n13.4.8 The recommended reference toxicity test consists of a control and five or more \nconcentrations in which the endpoint is an estimate of the toxicant concentration which \nis lethal to 50% of the test organisms in the time period prescribed by the test. The \nLC50 is determined by an appropriate procedure, such as the Trimmed Spearman- \nKarber Method, or Probit IMethod, Graphical Method, or the Linear Interpolation \nMethod (Section 12). \n13.4.9 The point estimation analysis methods recommended in this manual have been \nchosen primarily because they are well-tested, well-documented, and are applicable to \nmost types of test data. Many other methods were considered in the selection process. \nand it is recognized that the methods selected are not the only possible methods of \nanalysis for toxicity data. \n13.5 Precision of Sediment Toxicity Test Methods \n13.51 Intralaboratory Precision \n13.5.1.1 lntralaboratory precision has not been evaluated for any of the four species. \n13.5.2 Interlaboratory Precision \n13.5.2.1.1 Interlaboratory precision for R. abronius using 10-d whole sediment toxicity \ntests using the methods described in this manual (Table 11.1) is described by Mearns et \nal. (1986). Details of this study are described here. Five laboratories participated in the \nstudy, including federal and state government laboratories, a contract laboratory, and an \nacademic laboratory. The laboratories were chosen because each had demonstrated \nexperience in sediment toxicity tests with R. ahnius. The experimental design required \neach laboratory to conduct 10-d whole sediment tests on a total of 7 sediment \ntreatments. One control sediment was tested. Three sediment treatments consisted of \ncontrol sediment that was amended with CdCl, to result in the following measured \nconcentrations: 4, 8, and 12 mg Cd/kg dry weight. Three field-collected sediments were \nalso used. They were collected from the following locations in Puget Sound, WA: \nCentral Basin (Metro Seattle Station A6OOE), inner Sinclair Inlet. and Slip No. 1 in City \nWaterway, Commencement Bay. \n11s \n13.5.2.1.2 Amphipods were collected from a depth of 6 m off West Beach, Whidbey \nIsland, WA, and distributed to each participating laboratory. Each laboratory used its \nown source of clean seawater. \n13.5.2.1.3 All five laboratories had >\u2018H)% survival in control sediment, and thereby met \nthe performance criteria for the test. Mean survival in control sediment was 96.4%, the \nCV was 3.7%, and the range was from 92 to l(K)% (Table 13.1). Of the cadmium- \nspiked sediments, survival was the least variable in the 4 mg/kg Cd treatment. Mean \nsurvival was 96.2%, the CV was 4.2%, and the range was from 89 to 98%. The most \nvariable response was in the 12 mg/kg Cd sediment. Mean survival was 19%, the CV \nwas 79.1%, and the range was from 6 to 41%. City Waterway showed the least \nvariability among the field-collected sediments, with a mean survival of 83%, a CV of \n6.4%, and a range from 74 to 87%. Sinclair Inlet showed the greatest variability among \nthe field-collected sediments, with a mean survival of 78.8%, a CV of 11.3%, and a \nrange from 67 to 88%. \n13.5.2.2.1 Interlaboratory precision for A. abdita, E. estuarius, and L. pfumufosus using \n10-d whole sediment toxicity tests is described by C. Schlekat (SAIC, Narragansett, RI, \nunpublished data). Details of this study are described below. The number of \nparticipating laboratories varied with the test species: six for A. abdita, eight for \nE. estuarius, and seven for L. plumulosus. Laboratories were chosen on the basis of \ndemonstrated experience with the particular test species. Each laboratory conducted lo- \nd sediment toxicity tests on 4 sediment treatments. Sediment treatments were selected \nfor each species to include one negative control sediment and three contaminated \nsediments, Highly contaminated sediment from Black Rock Harbor, CT, was diluted \nwith species-specific, non-contaminated control sediment, creating test sediments that \nranged in relative contamination from low to high. \n13.5.2.2.2 Independent suppliers distributed amphipods to each laboratory. Ampefisca \nubditu and Euhaustorius estuarius were field-collected from locations in Narragansett, RI, \nand Newport, OR, respectively. Leptocheirus plumuiosus were obtained from cultures \nlocated at the University of Maryland, Queenstown, MD. Each laboratory used its own \nsupply of clean seawater. \n13.5.2.2.3 Mean survival of A. abdita in control sediment ranged from 85% to 100% \n(Table 13.2). Five of the six laboratories achieved greater than 90% survival in control \nsediment, which is the minimum survival that must be obtained in control sediment in \norder for the test to be accepted. The grand mean was 94.5%, and the CV was 5.5. A \ndose response was exhibited with decreasing survival with increasing proportions of \nBRH sediment. Test sediments (i.e., 7%, 25? and 33% BRH dilutions) exhibited a higher \ndegree of variability than in control sediment. In 7% BRH sediment, mean survival \nranged from 20% in Laboratory 5 to 97% in Laboratory 6 (Table 13.2). Twenty- \npercent BRH exhibited the greatest magnitude of variability, with a range of 1% to \n90%. Thirty-three percent BRH also exhibited considerable variability. The overall \nrank of sediment toxicity as measured by absolute mortality was consistent among \nlaboratories. One hundred percent of laboratories were in agreement for in \n116 \nTable 13.1 Inter-laboratory precision for survival of Rhepoxyzius abronius in 10-d \nwhole sediment toxicity tests using seven sediments \nPercent Survival (SD) in Sediment Samples \nI,ab C.\u2018ontrol 4 w-&r \nCd Central \nBasin Sinclair \nInlet c\u2019itj \n\\Vaterwaj \n1 Y2 i7) 89 (7) N7 (9 8 (3) x3 (11.5) 78 (13) 74 (11.5) \n2 46 (4) YX (3) 40 (10) 41 (11) 6Y i7.5) 67 (11) x7 (12) \n3 100 (0) 07 (3) 7x (10.5) I2 (7.5) 40 iX) x7 (7.5) x3 (12.5) \n4 Y4 (7) 94 (2) so (15) 6 (5.5) Y2 (5.5) HX (3) 84 (II) \n5 100 (0) Y% (4.5) 77 (3) 2x (11.5) x0 (3.5) 74 (Yj 87 (3) \nMean 46.4 (3.6) Y6.2 (4.1 j 76.4 ( 15.X j 1Y (15.5) 82.X (Y.1) 7x.x (KY) %3 (5.3) \n0\u2019 i%\u2018c) 3.7 4.2 20.7 7Y.I 1 1 A J 1.3 6-l \nNote: From Alearns et al., 19X6 \n117 \nTable 13.2 Inter-laboratory precision for survival of Ampelisca abditu in 10-d whole \nsediment toxicity tests using four sediments \nPercent Survival (SD) in Sediment Samples \nLab Control 7% Black Rock 20% Rlack Rock 33% Hlack Rwk \nHarbor Harbor Harbor \n1 Y7.0 (4.5) 63.0 (19.6) 10.0 (7.9) 6.0 (4.2) \n2 94.0 (8.Y) 75.0 (6.1) 7.0 i4.9 0.0 (0) \n3 97.0 (4.5) 90.0 (3.5) 36.0 (Y-6) 38.0 ( 14.4) \n4 94.0 (8.9) 79.0 (17.8) 7.0 (4.5) 3.0 (6.7) \n5 %O (7.1) 20.0 ( 12.7) 1.0 (2.2) 1.0 (2.2) \n6 100.0 (0) 97.0 (4.5) 90.0 (5.0) 72.0 ( 13.0) \nMean 94.5 (5.2) 70.7 ( 13.0) 25.2 (34.0) 20.0 (2Y -2) \ncv (5%) 5.5 38.9 135.1 146.2 \n%h?: FrMtI: C.

The range was from 96 to lOO%, with a Grand \n,Mean of 98.2% and a CV of 1.5 (Table 13.3). Grand Mean survival decreased with \nincreasing proportions of BRH. BRH sediment dilutions exhibited greater variability \nthan control sediment, with 25% BRH displaying the highest coefficient of variation. All \neight laboratories ranked survival of E. estuarius for control and 9% BRH as the least \nand second least toxic, respectively (Table 13.2). With the exception of Laboratories 1 \nand 8, the rank for 25% and 42% BRH were appropriately third and fourth least toxic, \nrespectively. \n13.5.2.2.5 Lqtucheirus plumulosus exhibited a range of survival in control sediment \nfrom 86% to 90% (Table 13.4). The Grand Mean was 91.8%, and the CV was 4.7. \nTwo laboratories, 3 and 5, failed to meet the minimum control sediment survival criteria \nof 90%. Grand means displayed a dose response of decreasing survival with increasing \nproportion of BRH sediment. Coefficients of variation were uniformly higher in BRH \nsediment dilutions as compared to control sediment, but did not vary greatly among \nBRH sediments (Table 13.4). Laboratory 1 appeared to be an outlier with respect to \nsurvival in BRH sediment dilutions, as survival of L. plumubsus was the lowest for all \nthree BRH sediments for any laboratory. The rank of sediments according to their \ntoxicity was generally consistent among laboratories. Agreement was 100% for control \nand the highest BRH sediment; these were appropriately ranked 1 and 4, respectively \n(Table 13.4). Laboratories 4 and 5 anomalously ranked 10% and 28% BRH as 3 and 2, \nrespectively, whereas the remaining laboratories ranked these sediments appropriately \naccording to the proportion of BRH. \n13.5.2.3 These tests exhibited similar or better precision than many chemical analyses \nand effluent toxicity test methods (USEPA, 199lb). The success rate for test initiation \nand completion of this round-robin evaluation is a good indication that a well equipped \nand trained staff will be able to successfully conduct this test. This is an important \nconsideration for any test performed routinely in any regulatory program. \nTable 13.3 Interlaboratory precision for survival of Eohaustorius estuarius in 10-d \nwhole sediment toxicity tests using four sediments \nPercent Survival (SD) in Sediment Samples \nLab Control 9% Black \nRock Harbor 25% Black \nRock Harbor 42% Black \nRock Harbor \nY6.0 (6.5) \n98.0 (2.7) \n97.0 (2.7) \n98.8 (2.7) \n1utM (0) \n100.0 (0) \nYY.0 (2.2) \n97.0 (6.7) 45.0 (19.7) \n76.0 ( 10.8) \n89.0 (4.2) \n59.0 (23.0) \n75.0 (19.7) \n6Y.O (12.9) \n79.0 (6.5) \n53.0 (14.4) 6.0 (6.5) \n46.0 (13,9) \n59.0 (10.8) \n47.2 (23.2.) \n36.0 (12.4) \n56.0 (18.8) \n61.0 (10.8) \n24.0 (14.7) 16.0 (9.6) \n25.0 (7.1) \n45.0 ( 10.0) \n45.8 (27.0) \n16.0 (9.6) \n38.0 ( 14.4) \n50.0 (7.9) \n29.0 ( 15.6) \nMean 98.2 (1.5) 68.1 (14.7) 41.9 (IY.l) 33.1 (13.5) \ncv (%) 1.5 21.6 45.5 40.9 \nNote: From: C.
