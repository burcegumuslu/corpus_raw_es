This \nmodel is similar t o the current proposal of person -centered care2, that is trying to \novercome the paradigm of care based fundamentally on the disease. It aims to \nimprove the teaching of medicine and medical care  3.  \nThe choice of specific homeopathic medicine is based on the law of similars, described \nby Hippocrates ( Similia similibus curantur ) the father of medicine and refers to the \nfact that \"there are substances of animal, vegetable or mineral origin capable of \nproducing in a healthy person at doses high, symptoms simi lar to those that manifest \nin sick individuals\u201d, so the symptomatology that each patient presents (known as \nmorbid individuality), is decisive for the choice of medication and to generate an \noptimal response to treatment  4. It is important to emphasize that the administration \nof the homeopathic medicine is in ultra -dilute doses to reduce the effects of some \n                                                 \n1 Prepared by the Directorate of Traditional Medicine and Intercultural Development of the Ministry of Health and the D. in \nC.

Between each homeopathic dilution, \nthe succussion process is carried out, which consists of shaking the bottle vigorously, \nvertically, hitting a surface that cushions the blow. This shaking must be such that the \ndilution must hit the top and bottom. of the bottle, at least 100 times, so it is not a \nsimple dilution o f 1:10 or 1:100, but rather this procedure confers certain \nphysicochemical properties to the drug, widely described by studies in which \nstructures or aggregates (clusters) are observed. ) with electromagnetic or \nthermoluminescent properties even when ultra -diluted6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. This dilution \nprocess with succussion is known as dynamization.  \nHomeopathic medicines, once dynamized, can be presented as a liquid hydro -\nalcoholic solution, or in globules of lactose or sucrose impregnated with said solution, \ncommonly called \"chochitos\" in M\u00e9xico. The hydroalcoholic solution and the \nglobules are the vehicle, equivalent to the excipient of allopathic medication tablets.  \nRegarding the scientific basis of the effects of homeopathy, there are a large number \nof arti cles that have reported the biological effect of homeopathic medicine in \nmedium -low dilutions at different levels (cellular, molecular and systemic), because \nthey still contain molecules.

Regarding the mechanisms to explain the effect of ultra -dilute doses \n(beyond the Avogadro -Loschmidt limit), it s explanation is studied: due to the \nsensitivity to bioelectromagnetic information in the face of atomic and molecular \naggregates or clusters, the impact of nanomolecules, therapeutic biological targets, \nthe participation of water chains in signaling and t he regulation of bifurcation points \nof systemic networks, among other explanations. High -dilution pharmacology is \nemerging as a pioneering topic in the domain of nanomedicine and is bringing \ngreater insi ght to the claims of homeopathy13. \nA controversy that occurs with homeopathic medicines is that at ultra -dilute \nconcentrations of the substance with which the homeopathic medicine is made, it \nis not possible to identify it with conventional laboratory equipment and procedures. \nThe pharmacology of high dilutio ns or ultra dilutions has allowed different protocols \nto be carried out for the development of techniques and/or equipment that \ndemonstrate that homeopathic medicines still contain said substance and not just \nwater or a lcohol as is normally mentioned14.  \nHomeopathic medicine was developed in Germany more than 200 years ago by Dr. \nSamuel Hahnemann, and has remained in force as a medical system to this day. It is \nrecognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is included in the WHO \nStrategy 2014 -2023 on Traditional and Complementary Medicine15, 16. Today, it is \nwidely accepted worldwide and is used in many countries; in the cases of Mexico, \nSwitzerland, Brazil, India, among others, it has official recognition, and is even part of \nits health system, while  in other countries such as Colombia, Argentina, Cuba, \nGermany, France, Russia, Poland, Croatia, Turkey, Canada, among others, is well \naccepted.  \nIn Mexico, it is recognized by the current legal framework and is regulated by the \nFederal Commission for the P rotection against Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS).

During epidemics, a \npreventive strategy has also been implemented ( homeoprophylaxi s28). The \nhomeopathic method usually distinguishes the rare, peculiar, remarkable and \ncharacteristic symptoms of the epidemic, to consider one or a couple of homeopathic \nmedicines, known as Epidemic Genius or \" Genius Epidemicus \", which cover most of \nthe symptoms  presented by the sick and that have been used to reduce the risk of \ncontagion and to reduce the severity of the symptoms of the disease.Another strategy \nused is the use of a drug known as \" Nosode \", which is prepared from the secretions of \npatients with sa id disease under the rules for the preparation of homeopathic \nmedicines to obtain an adequate ultradilution.  \nA case of special mention is in the influenza pandemic of 1918 -1919, known as the \nSpanish flu, due to the amount of historical records of the use o f homeopathy. We \nnow know that the Spanish flu virus29 was an avian virus and it has been the worst \nepidemic on record. In just 18 months, 18% of the world's population contracted the \ndisease and 20 to 40 million individuals died. The epidemic was so devast ating that \nthe average life expectancy in the United States fell by 10 years.

The article includes a table where 36 \ninvestigations are considered. The results suggest that in primary care, the impact of \nhomeopath ic treatment is not inferior to conventional treatment.43.  \nThere is evidence regarding the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome  44.
