BONVEH\u00cd2\n1Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Buenos Aires, 2Centro de Educaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica e\nInvestigaciones Cl\u00ednicas Norberto Quirno (CEMIC), Buenos Aires, Argentina\nAbstract The proportion of adult population has increased globally and the current projections indicate that,\n by 2050, the group of 60 years and older will represent 21.1%. There are now vaccines exclusively \ndesigned for adults and others that are applied in early life but need to be updated later in life. Vaccines for adults \nare not only based on their respective age group but are also linked to risk factors like occupation, life style, \nhealth situation, among others. At the same time, longevity brings with it a weakening of the immune response \nto vaccines, a process known as immunosenescence representing an increasing challenge to adequately protect \nthis age group. For some time, WHO has been promoting the term \u201cVaccination through the life course\u201d allow -\ning for an extension of the vaccination vision and taking adults as an integral part into the national vaccination \nprograms and calendars. There are several vaccine preventable diseases affecting adults, but those associated \nwith influenza virus and pneumococcus are the ones that affect the largest age group. Several recommendations \ninclude, additionally, others to prevent diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis A and B, meningococcus, \nchickenpox, measles, rubella, mumps, herpes zoster, human papilloma virus and others. There are still many \nchallenges to overcome in order to fully include adults, particularly health personnel, and to make vaccines ex -\ntensively valued as a prevention tool in order to achieve a healthy life. \nKey words : vaccines, preventable diseases, immunization programs, adult, elderly \nResumen  Vacunas en adultos.  La proporci\u00f3n de poblaci\u00f3n de adultos se ha incrementado globalmente y\n las proyecciones muestran que para el a\u00f1o 2050 los mayores de 60 a\u00f1os representar\u00e1n el 21.1%. \nActualmente se dispone de vacunas dirigidas exclusivamente a adultos y otras que se aplican en ni\u00f1os pero \nque se deben actualizar a lo largo de la vida. Las vacunas en adultos se administran, no solo por el grupo de \nedad al que pertenecen, sino tambi\u00e9n por factores como ocupaci\u00f3n, estilos de vida o estado de salud. Al mismo \ntiempo, la longevidad disminuye la respuesta inmune a las vacunas por el fen\u00f3meno de inmunosenescencia, \nlo cual representa un desaf\u00edo para proteger adecuadamente a este grupo. Desde hace varios a\u00f1os la OMS, ha \npropiciado la utilizaci\u00f3n del t\u00e9rmino \u201cVacunaci\u00f3n en el curso de la vida\u201d lo cual permite extender la visi\u00f3n de la \nvacunaci\u00f3n y considerar al adulto como una parte integral de los planes y calendarios de inmunizaci\u00f3n. Existen \nvarias enfermedades prevenibles por vacunas en adultos, pero aquellas asociadas al virus de influenza y al \nneumococo, son las que comprenden el grupo m\u00e1s extenso. Diversas recomendaciones incluyen, adem\u00e1s de \nestas vacunas, otras dirigidas a prevenir difteria, t\u00e9tanos, tos convulsa, hepatitis A y B, meningococo, varicela, \nsarampi\u00f3n, rub\u00e9ola, parotiditis, herpes z\u00f3ster, virus del papiloma humano y otras enfermedades. Se reconocen \nmuchos desaf\u00edos a superar para poder incorporar plenamente al adulto, incluyendo al personal de salud, y lograr \nque la vacunaci\u00f3n sea una herramienta de prevenci\u00f3n valorada ampliamente para el desarrollo de una vida \nsaludable.\nPalabras clave:  vacunas, enfermedades prevenibles, programas de inmunizaci\u00f3n, adulto, adulto mayor\nReceived: 29-IX-2019 Accepted: 30-X-2019\nPostal address : Mirta Roses, Avda. Pte. Quintana 494 7 A, 1129 \nBuenos Aires, Argentina \n e-mail: rosesperiago@hotmail.comAdults at any age are exposed to diverse infectious \ndiseases which are vaccine preventable. The risk of be -\ning affected by some of these diseases and the recom -\nmendations to be vaccinated to prevent them depends \non several factors, like their health situation, age, life \nstyle, epidemiological considerations, risk exposure like occupational o travel related; children, on the contrary, \nare vaccinated, almost exclusively, based on their age1-9.\nScientific and technological progress have made pos -\nsible to produce several vaccines for adult use, a group \nage not considered previously as a target, defining now \na more complex scenario for better prevention in these \ngroup. There is a low risk perception among those in these \nage group, since they are the survivors of child diseases; \nalso, because most of deaths from vaccine preventable \ndiseases are concentrated now in communities and \ncountries under the poverty line. These are some of the \ndeterminants for the low global coverage of adults, includ -\ning health personnel10-13.VACCINES IN ADULTS553\nHowever, from demographic data, the proportion of \nadults and older adults is the top segment of accelerated \npopulation growth. The proportion of people > 60 years \nincreased from 9.2% in 1990 to 12.7% in 2015 and will \nreach 21.1% in 2050, being the growth even more ac -\ncelerated in low income countries. \nLongevity generates a progressive loss of natural an -\ntibodies acquired through suffering the diseases or being \nvaccinated14. Immunosenescence is a natural ageing pro -\ncess of the immunological system and may be aggravated \nby diseases, emotional stress, malnutrition, and other \nfactors. Due to a reduced production of hematopoietic \ntissue in the bone marrow and the decreasing renewal \npotential of the mother cells, the natural, nonspecific and \nrapid immune response is compromised15. Epithelial barri -\ners are more permissive to invasion by infectious agents, \nneutrophils show functional alterations and macrophages \nbecome less efficient16, 17, creating a diminished response \nof older adults to vaccines. \nVaccine response is dependent on the antigen type: \nattenuated live virus and protein associated antigens \ninduce antibodies production in high levels, as well as \nTCD8. Inactivated virus vaccines only induce high level of \nantibodies. That is why older adults produce low antibod -\nies level to influenza, hepatitis B, diphtheria and tetanus \nvaccines. Several interventions have been developed to \nincrease older adults\u2019 response: higher concentration of \nantigens, additional doses, use of subcutaneous injections \ninstead of intramuscular, use of adjuvants and conjugated \nvaccines18-22.\nIn 1989, the World Health Assembly called to elimi -\nnate neonatal tetanus by 1995, launching the pregnant \nwomen vaccination. By the end of the 90s, due to measles \noutbreaks in adults, adolescents and young adults were \nincluded in mass campaigns, and, at the same time, older \npeople started to receive seasonal flu vaccines annually. \nLittle by little, health personnel and people with comor -\nbidities began to receive other vaccines like hepatitis B, \nHib ( Haemophilus influenzae  type B) and pneumococcal \npolysaccharide 23 valent (PPV23). Respiratory infections, \nviral and bacterial linked, are more severe in the extremes \nof life, being pneumococcus and influenza virus the two \nmain causes23-28.\nThere are several new vaccines under development, \nlike respiratory syncytial virus and others containing new \nimmunogens, that are more effective or use new technolo -\ngies, like the inactivated vaccine against herpes zoster. It \nis increasingly more important, for the scientific community \nas well as for the entire society, to know more about the \nwide spectrum of available vaccines for adults, and to use \nthem in an optimal and rational way, in order to be able \nto reduce the morbimortality from these diseases, reduce \nhealth costs and improve quality of life. \nThere are several evidence-based recommendations \nat international, regional and local level for vaccines in adults9-12. Usually the guidelines recommend influenza, \npneumococcus, diphtheria/tetanus (double-adults) or \npertussis/diphtheria/tetanus (triple acellular), hepatitis A \ny B, meningococcus, varicella, measles/rubella/mumps \n(triple viral), herpes zoster, human papilloma virus and \nothers, i.e. people in risk or endemic areas Argentinian \nhemorrhagic fever, yellow fever1-3, 9, 11-14, 16, 17, 22-25.\nDiphtheria\nIt has recently reemerged in the Americas with cases \nin Haiti, Dominican Republic and Venezuela; immunity \ndeclines progressively with years21.\nTetanus\nCases are reported annually in several countries and \nmost of them, in adults with incomplete or obsolete vac -\ncination17.\nPertussis (whooping cough)\nRecommendations are to include acellular triple vaccine \n(dTpa), at least one dose during the life course, instead of \ndouble (dT), due to the burden of disease caused by Bor-\ndetella pertussis  since this disease has usually a mild or \natypical presentation in adults and is less notified in older \nadults over 65 years of age17, 26, 27. Also recommended is \ndTpa vaccine in the last trimester of pregnancy in order to \ntransfer antibodies from mother to child, close to delivery, \ngenerating high impact on morbimortality of newborns \nand under 6 months old28. Health workers and caregiv -\ners in contact with newborns should also be vaccinated \nsince they become important carriers and disseminators \nfor pertussis.\nInfluenza\nInfluenza vaccine was introduced for older adults, preg -\nnant women and adults with chronic diseases. Due to \nminor antigen changes in the virus, each year the com -\nposition of the vaccine is updated on two occasions, in \nFebruary in the northern hemisphere and in September in \nthe southern hemisphere. Inactivated trivalent vaccine is \ndeveloped in embryonated eggs and contains two virus, \nsubtypes influenza A (H1N1 y H3N2) and one lineage \nof virus B (Victoria or Yamagata). Vaccine effectiveness \nto prevent non-complicated flu in adults over 60 years is \naround 70%, while in adults older than 60 years, effec -\ntiveness is lower, not more than 53%. For this age group, \nthe use of inactivated trivalent flu vaccine is associated \nwith a decrease in pneumonia hospitalizations between \n32% and 45%, in hospital mortality due to pneumonia and MEDICINA  - Volumen 79 - N\u00b0 6/1 - N\u00daMERO ESPECIAL 80 ANIVERSARIO, 2019554\nflu between 31% and 65% and for respiratory diseases \nbetween 43% and 50%, while reducing mortality for all \ncauses between 27% and 30%18. \nIn pregnant women the inactivated trivalent flu vaccine \nreduces flu like diseases by 36% with an effectiveness \nof 63% reduction of flu cases in under 6 months old \nchildren29. \nFor the more frequent comorbidities, like those associ -\nated with chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases, \nas well as diabetes, the flu vaccine has been proven to \nreduce the risk of complications like a new acute heart \nattack or hospitalization rates in diabetics, during the virus \ncirculation season30. One of the challenges for flu vaccine \nis to achieve higher efficacy in adults over 60, the group \nsuffering the highest rate for flu related hospitalization and \ndeath. Inactivated trivalent vaccines with adjuvants or with \nhigher doses of antigens (60 micrograms instead of current \n15 micrograms) have been proven to increase efficacy \nand effectiveness in these age group by around 25%19. \nSince 2013, and due to antigenic differences in the two \ncirculating virus B lineages and the virus impact on flu dis -\nease, WHO recommended the development of quadriva -\nlent vaccines containing the two lineages31. Quadrivalent \nvaccines, compared with trivalent, have demonstrated a \nsuperior immunogenicity for B components and similar \nfor the other strains, in children as well as in adolescents, \nyoung and older adults with higher effectiveness in chil -\ndren and young adults32-37. \nOther vaccines available for adults are the one pro -\nduced with recombinant DNA technology and those \ncellular line-based. The first one avoids mutations or ad -\naptative changes suffered by the virus during replication \nin embryonated eggs and is faster to produce. This vac -\ncine was first developed as trivalent, but now is available \nas quadrivalent, contains 45 micrograms of each one of \nthe antigens, and is already approved by the regulatory \nagencies in several countries for adult use38, 39. Cellular \nline-based vaccines are not dependent on eggs avail -\nability allowing for more volume and faster production. \nSome are already approved in Europe and the USA for \nuse in adults40. \nPneumonia\nInvasive pneumococcal disease, seen as bacteremia, \nmeningitis or other severe locations, is more frequent in \nolder adults or adults with comorbidities, particularly immu -\nnocompromised persons, or with consumption of tobacco or \nalcohol. Streptococcus pneumoniae  is the most commonly \nidentified agent for community acquired pneumonia (CAP), \nthe most frequent infection in adults. Since the 80s the anti -\npneumococcic vaccine with 23 polysaccharides (PPSV23) \ncontaining serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, \n11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F,18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F and 33F, protecting against more than 85% of serotypes re -\nsponsible for invasive modalities, is available. The vaccine \nis developed from capsular polysaccharides and produces \na response independent of T cells, therefore, not immuno -\ngenic in under 2 years old. Several studies in adults have \nshown that it prevents invasive forms, while for community \nacquired pneumonia its effect is to attenuate the severity, \nbut without evidence yet that it serves to prevent occur -\nrence16, 41. The most recent development of a conjugated \npneumococci vaccine with a transporter protein, initially 7 \nvalent and later on 11 and 13 valent, has allowed for a T \ncell dependent immune response with efficacy in under 2 \nyears old for the prevention of invasive forms, pneumonia \nand middle otitis due to S. pneumoniae . Conjugated vac -\ncines also reduce nasopharynx carriers, with a herd effect \ndocumented through the observed reduction on invasive \ndisease due to S. pneumoniae  in unvaccinated older adults. \nThe conjugated 13 valent vaccine (PCV13) contains sero -\ntypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F \nshared with vaccine PPSV23 and one own serotype 6A. \nStudies comparing vaccine PCV13 in adults with PPSV23, \nhave shown a better immunogenic response for most of the \nserotypes they both share, better response when PCV13 \nis administered first if they are both administered. This \nvaccine has shown efficacy close to 50% to prevent CAP \ndue to serotypes included in the vaccine, in a randomized \ndouble-blind study compared with placebo in older adults. \nIn spite of the burden of disease in older adults and adults \nwith comorbidities due to S. pneumoniae , of data about \neffectiveness of PPSV23 and PCV13 in adults, as well as \nthe herd impact due to pediatric vaccination, there is no \nyet consensus or uniformity in the recommendations about \nuse of antipneumococcal vaccines in adults at international \nlevel. As an example, the PAHO TAG Vaccines (Techni -\ncal Advisory Group on Vaccines) stressed the importance \nof the herd impact through pediatric vaccination and calls \nthe countries to expand the coverage in order to protect \nolder adults. ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization \nPractices) from CDC-USA recommends for older adults and \nadults with comorbidities the use of a sequential scheme \nincluding both vaccines PCV13 y PPSV2342. The Ministry \nof Health of Argentina has adopted this same scheme in \n2017 and, in both cases, evaluate the impact of pediatric \nvaccination on the incidence of invasive forms and CAP \nthrough herd effect. In Germany, the STIKO, national \ncommittee for vaccines recommendations, has advised \nto use only PPSV23 in adults over 60 and revaccination \nevery 6 years41.\nThere are new conjugated vaccines under develop -\nment with 15 and 20 serotypes to allow for an extension \nof protection. Hopefully there will be more and better data \nto establish more clearly the best alternative to protect \nagainst invasive forms in older adults and those with \ncomorbidities and from CAP which is the most frequent \nin these population groups (Table 1).VACCINES IN ADULTS555\nTABLE 1.\u2013 Vaccines in adults\nVaccine 17-64 years \u2265 65 years\n1 dose every 10 years in all adults \n1 dose to replace one dose of Td once during adult lifetime, \nalso 1 dose in each pregnancy \n1 dose every year (seasonal vaccine) in adults with risk \nconditions, pregnant women and health care workers \n1 or 2 doses in adults with risk conditions \n1 dose in adults with risk conditions\n3 doses in transplant and HIV infected men and women up \nto 26 years \nIn women, based on individualized indication, can be \nadministered without age limit \n3 doses (0, 1 and 6 m) for all susceptible adults \n2 doses (0, 6 to 12 m) in susceptible adults, particularly in \nthose with occupational risk or based on life style \n1 or 2 doses (revaccinate with 1 MenACWY dose every 5 \nyears if the risk remains) in adults with risk of severe diseases \nor increased risk of exposure (i.e., travelers, microbiology \nlaboratory personnel, closed communities)\n1 dose in travelers or those who live in risk areas \n1 dose for those aged 15 to 65 years who live in risk areas \nNo available for \u2264 50 years\n1 or 2 doses\n2 doses in susceptible young adults, particularly non-pregnant \nwomen in childbearing age, health care workers, individuals \nunder high risk of exposure and within 72 h after contact with \na varicella patient \n1 dose if there is risk of exposure (revaccinate every 3 years \nif the risk remains)\n1 dose (anatomic of functional asplenia), 3 doses after HSCTTetanus/diphteria (Td)\nTd+acellular pertussis \n(Tdap)\nInfluenza\nPPSV23\nPCV13\nHPV\nHepatitis B\nHepatitis A\nMenACWY and MenB\nYellow fever\nArgentinean Hemorragic \nFever\nHerpes zoster\nMMR\nVaricella\nTyphoid fever\nHaemophilus influenzae  \ntype B1 dose every year in all \nadults \u2265 65 years\n1 dose in all adults \u2265 65 \nyears\n1 dose in all adults \u2265 65 \nyears\nAssess risk/benefit ( \u2265 60 years)\n1 dose (live zoster vaccine) \n2 doses (recombinant zoster \nvaccine).

The first vaccine was composed \nof live attenuated virus, with the same strain as vari -\ncella, but in higher concentration. This is administered \nin one only subcutaneous dose in adults over 50, with a \ndemonstrated efficacy of 51.3% to prevent occurrence \nof herpes zoster and of 66.5% to prevent post-herpetic \nneuralgia. More recently, the vaccine with recombinant \nviral subunits (HZ/su) using glycoprotein E and adjuvant \nAS01B, to be administered in two intramuscular doses \nin space of 2 months, has demonstrated an over 90% \nefficacy to prevent herpes zoster and over 88% to prevent \npost-herpetic neuralgia43. \nOther vaccines for adults to be considered, include \nyellow fever44, hepatitis B and A45, measles/rubella/mumps \n(triple viral), Argentinian hemorrhagic fever46, meningitis \ndue to meningococci47, typhoid fever48, Japan encephalitis, \nand tick born encephalitis49. \nConclusions  \nStarting with a WHO initiative, the use of \u201cVaccination \nthough the life course\u201d has expanded the use of vac -\ncines from the beginning to the end of life. This strategy \nallows to expand the vision of vaccination and to include \nthe adults as an integral part of vaccinations plans and \nprograms and into immunization calendars. There are \nstill many challenges to overcome in order to fully in -\nclude adults and to be able to make vaccination a highly \nvalued prevention tool to achieve a healthy life. Among \nthese challenges are: insufficient information and medi -\ncal knowledge on prevention through immunization, the \nhuge amount of preventive recommendations that leave \nvaccines out, the lack of acknowledgement of adults on \nthis matter, the fear of adverse reactions, myths against \nvaccines and uncertainty about their real efficacy, bar -\nriers to access since most of vaccination services and \ncenters are only prepared for pediatric care, lack of op -\nportunities for vaccination in the health systems and in \nthe resource allocation. These are some of the obstacles \nto overcome. Well vaccinated adults protect children, \nprotect other adults and older adults and very importantly, \nare an example influencing the society, demonstrating \nthey trust, appreciate and demand vaccines on time \nand schedule. \nConflict of interest : None to declareReferences\n 1.
