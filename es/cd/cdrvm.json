Even at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008, the Fed\u2019s actions were much more limited in scope \u2013 as well as speed.\nMy colleagues and I at the Indiana Business Research Center have been studying the Fed, its actions and the economic impact for over a quarter-century. Here\u2019s a quick primer on the U.S. central bank, how it works and what it\u2019s doing to keep the economy from sinking into depression.\nNo guarantee of safety\nBefore Congress created the Federal Reserve System, the safety and soundness of U.S. banks was hardly a sure thing.\nBank runs \u2013 when a large number of customers withdraw their deposits simultaneously over concerns of a bank\u2019s solvency \u2013 were common, such as during the Gilded Age from 1863 to 1907, when financial crises occurred frequently.\nYet many Americans were uncomfortable with the idea of a powerful central financial authority. Alexander Hamilton\u2019s short-lived First Bank of the United States, which was \u201cdominated by big banking and money interests,\u201d did little to help to allay those concerns.\nWithout a central bank, it fell to private financiers like John Pierpont Morgan to avert financial crises by infusing their own capital into the economy. Recurring crises like these eventually led more people to believe that monetary policy and banking should be centralized, culminating in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act.\nThe act said the Fed would handle monetary policy and stimulus, keep banks safe and sound, and make sure the amount of money circulating was appropriate.\nWhile initially successful at limiting bank runs, the Fed failed to prevent the speculative bubble that preceded the Great Depression \u2013 and the bankruptcy of nearly 10,000 banks. This led to the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933, which separated commercial and investment banking and created federal deposit insurance to prevent bank runs.\nCongress more clearly delineated the Fed\u2019s purpose in 1977, when it passed the Federal Reserve Reform Act and established what became known as the \u201cdual mandate\u201d of maximum employment and stable prices.\nIt continues to perform other functions in line with its founding purpose, such as identifying and neutralizing risks to the economy, protecting consumers and promoting the soundness of the financial system and individual institutions.\nThe Fed\u2019s two key tools\nThe Fed consists of a group of seven economists \u2013 collectively known as the Board of Governors \u2013 who have two key tools to affect monetary policy. The Board of Governors uses 12 regional banks of the Federal Reserve System to perform banking services.\nThe most well-known tool is the Fed\u2019s ability to set short-term interest rates. When it lowers rates, the Fed aims to reduce borrowing costs for companies and consumers to encourage more lending and investment, thus stimulating the economy. It raises rates primarily when the economy is strong, when it wants to keep a lid on inflation.\nThe other key tool is its ability to buy and sell debt securities in open-market operations.\nThe Fed used this tool for the first time in 1923 ostensibly to stem a recession. By buying Treasury securities from private sellers, it was able to pump more money into the banking system, ensuring there was enough cheap credit for borrowers.\nThe Fed reimagined this powerful tool during the 2008 financial crisis, when it began a program of \u201cquantitative easing\u201d to buy longer-term, riskier debt. At the program\u2019s peak in 2015, the Fed had accrued over US$4.5 trillion in both safe and riskier debt on its balance sheet.\nThe Fed\u2019s plan to save the US\nFinancial markets have been in a panic since late February, when they began to reflect anxiety about the economic impact of the new coronavirus.\nSince then, the Fed has engaged in a variety of actions to keep financial markets working and calm investors, including backstopping the commercial paper market and supporting money market funds.\nIt has also been using its two tools in more traditional ways.\nThe Fed used its first tool in dramatic fashion recently when it cut rates twice, first by half a percentage point and then by a full point, bringing its target rate to basically zero. Barring negative rates, there\u2019s very little it can do to further stimulate the economy this way.\nSo it turned to its second tool and committed to essentially buy as many securities as necessary to stave off mass layoffs, debt defaults, bankruptcies and depression. This includes buying bundles of investment-grade corporate bonds, student loans and credit card debt for the first time. More recently, it added junk-rated municipal and corporate bonds to the list.\nAs a result, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, which had fallen below $4 trillion last year, has now swelled to a new record of $4.7 trillion \u2013 and could double in size before it\u2019s done, based on the new lending authority it\u2019s being granted by the federal bailout.\nTime will tell if this \u2013 alongside the $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus Congress is injecting \u2013 will be enough.\n___\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.", "language": null, "image":
