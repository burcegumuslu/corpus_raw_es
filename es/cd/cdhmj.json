As over 70,000 congregate this week, between Aug. 27 to Sept. 4, in the high altitudes of the hot and windy Black Rock Desert, Renown Health\u2019s emergency and clinical care teams are ready to care for Burners who may find themselves ill and in need of additional urgent, emergent care or hospitalization. This year, people from across the world are expected to make the journey in RVs and cars brimming with tents, food, water, artwork, and costumes, temporarily turning Black Rock into the state\u2019s third largest city. \u201cThe Burning Man Project has done an excellent job preparing participants to have a safe, healthy, and wonderful time building Black Rock City and living on the playa for nine days to nurture the distinctive culture emerging from that experience. However, bringing over 70,000 people together in a high altitude, desert environment with limited access to water, food, and sanitary conditions- always presents a challenge,\u201d says Brian Erling, MD, MBA, president and CEO of Renown Health and an experienced emergency medicine physician. \u201cHaving excellent care on the playa and plans in place back here in Reno helps to mitigate that risk and ensure the health and safety of all participants.\u201d \u201cWe welcome every Burner to northern Nevada,\u201d says Bret Frey, MD, the board-certified emergency medicine physician who heads up the largest Emergency Department at Renown Regional Medical Center; which has the highest-level trauma center for 100,000 miles, located in Reno, NV. Dr. Frey has 23 years of experience in the medical field, and 23 years of experience treating people who have experienced Burning Man. \u201cBurning Man is a fascinating event, and most people have a great time. However, if things go wrong, they are fortunate to have the BlackRock City Emergency Services Department, 24/7, to help. Back here in Reno, we serve as their \u2018back up,\u2019 providing care as needed, for the ill and injured and supporting clinical teams when they\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\u201d Renown Health is home to three 24/7 Emergency Rooms that provide the highest level of emergency and trauma care in the region: Renown Regional Medical Center is the only Level II Trauma Center between Sacramento and Salt Lake City. Located near downtown Reno, this Emergency Room has several helipads and ambulance banks for patients requiring emergency and trauma care. Renown Children\u2019s Hospital at Renown Regional Medical Center is home to the only Pediatric Emergency Room in the region designed just for kids. This location is staffed by pediatric specialists and provides child-sized equipment and family-friendly areas. Renown South Meadows Medical Center includes South Reno\u2019s first 24/7 Emergency Room. Located just off I580, this location is designed to treat patients who need immediate attention for emergencies. These locations are designed to assess and care for emergency situations, including: Heart attack symptoms Stroke symptoms Broken bones Shortness of breath Seizures Severe bleeding Head injuries Chest pains Severe pain Venomous stings and bite All of Renown\u2019s emergency rooms are staffed by Northern Nevada Emergency Physicians, including pediatric specialists and physicians who have completed fellowship training in specialty areas such as sports medicine, ultrasound and emergency medical services. A few interesting medical conditions (Playa Foot and Playa Lung), are associated with Burning Man. The Black Rock Desert in northwestern Nevada is part of the lakebed of the ancient Lake Lahontan, a deep lake that existed 15,000 years ago. Lake Lahontan left fine sediments on the lake bottom to form the extremely flat surface. Playa dust is made of both larger and smaller particulate matter. The Playa dust is in the air, on the ground, and on everything in Black Rock City. People combat the dust with masks, bandannas, and colorful respirators to keep the chalky dust out of their mouths and nostrils, but the effort is often futile. Playa Foot is a malady unique to the Black Rock Desert caused by the alkali dust that makes up the desert. It is, in essence, a chemical burn. The best prevention is keeping feet covered as much as possible, applying a moisturizing skin lotion before bed and wearing socks and closed shoes each day on the playa. \u201cPlaya Lung, where the particulate is breathed into the lungs, may cause coughing, throat pain and loss of voice in the short-term,\u201d says William Graham, MD, a specialist in Pulmonary Medicine and Critical Care Medicine at Renown Health. \u201cThe dust can cause health issues for smokers, children and elderly and people with pre-existing conditions like asthma and COPD. The best prevention is to get a mask that\u2019s comfortable with n99 filters, wear the mask as much as possible and change the filters often. Be sure to drink lots of water and take protection from windstorms. A doctor visit is recommended if any effects of breathing in dust persist beyond a week or two.\u201d Dr. Derek Beenfeldt is the Chief Medical Officer for Renown\u2019s not-for-profit insurance arm HometownHealth, and has been a frequent participant in the Burning Man experience over the years. In the interest of wanting every person to have a wonderful experience while here- especially since over half of the participants live outside the U.S. health care system, he reminds people of the number of free and low-cost on-site health care and testing resources provided on the playa at Black Rock City. \u201cIt is important for Burning Man participants to know that without US health care insurance coverage, the costs can be significant for transportation off the playa for a medical evacuation, hospital emergency department care or hospitalization. Even for people who have insurance, in the past, some have faced some significant out-of-pocket expenses for the flight or transportation to Reno-area hospitals or emergency departments.\u201d He shares the following information; On Site Medical Response A community of EMTs, paramedics, nurses, medical students, and physicians are on site at Black Rock City in RVs to provide emergency response and urgent care to participants as needed. Local Hospital Response Since 2011, the Burning Man organization, has contracted with Humboldt General Hospital in Winnemucca, Nev., to staff and equip Rampart Urgent Care, a field hospital that offers X-rays, ultrasounds, a hand-held head scanner, lab tests and a pharmacy. The single-room wooden structure is easily seen- it is painted pink and yellow. The hospital\u2019s 40 beds are located in adjoining tents. At Rampart, when possible, patients are treated on site. EMTs, medics and nurses are empowered to practice medicine to the fullest ability their licensing and credentialing allow. Patients are not charged for Rampart Urgent Care services, which is covered as part of their ticket fee. The Nevada State Health Division, Bureau of Health Protection Services is also on the playa. You will know them by the Nevada State Health Division logo on their shirts. All Renown\u2019s physicians remind people that if they are experiencing symptoms of a heart attack or stroke, they should go to the closest emergency room (ER) to get needed medical care.

La misi\u00f3n de Renown Health marca una diferencia genuina en la salud y el bienestar de las personas y las comunidades Yesterday, Reno\u2019s only not-for-profit health system celebrated local organizations with grant funding for 2023 to improve the health and well-being of our community. \u201cImproving the health and wellness of an entire population of people is not easy. Es una tarea enorme. Nevada continues to rank near the bottom of overall health rankings in the U.S. and suffers from high mortality rates for chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease,\u201d said Brian Erling, MD, MBA, President & CEO of Renown Health. \u201cWe must continue to work with partners in the field, who share our mission- to keep people healthy, to make healthcare more accessible and affordable, and to achieve the vision of a healthier Nevada.\u201d As a non-profit organization, Renown reinvests every dollar earned back to the community; in staffing, technology, treatments, training, and research to improve health and prevent illness. Yesterday, their senior leadership team took an hour to celebrate and support local not for profit partners for their efforts to improve the well-being of our community, with a boxed lunch, conversation, cake and therapy dogs from Renown\u2019s volunteer program. \u201cRenown Health has long-standing commitment to the community spans more than 160 years,\u201d said Suzanne Bharati Hendery, MA, APR, Chief Communications & Customer Experience Officer for Renown. \u201cThis commitment has grown and evolved through significant thought and care in considering our community\u2019s most pressing health needs. One way this is done is through conducting a periodic, comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). The most current assessments were completed by an external health care consulting service working with Renown and include quantitative and qualitative data that serve to guide both our community benefit and strategic planning. Through the CHNA process, Renown Health has identified the greatest health needs among our communities, enabling Renown to ensure our resources are appropriately directed toward outreach, prevention, education, and wellness opportunities where the greatest impact can be realized.\u201d Renown\u2019s Community Benefit grant funding process for 2023 is now complete. This is the second year of Renown\u2019s 3-year Community Health Needs Plan that seeks to improve the priorities of Healthy Behaviors; Immunizations and Infectious Diseases; Behavioral Health (Mental Health & Substance Abuse) and Youth & Adolescent Health. The success of the health system\u2019s partnerships in improving the health of Washoe County is measured in the health statistics and data that is reported at the local, state, and national level on the website, NevadaTomorrow.org.

Today, Renown Health and the University of Nevada, Reno Orvis School of Nursing announced a milestone in the longstanding partnership and a new fund to provide nursing students with full-ride scholarships, and in turn, assist in creating a sustainable nursing workforce in northern Nevada for years to come. The Gerald \u201cJerry\u201d Smith Academic-Practice Partnership established with Renown Health Foundation will provide funding for up to 24 students a year. Recipients receive funding for tuition, books and nursing fees, along with a guaranteed career in nursing with Renown Health following graduation and license obtainment. The Gerald \u201cJerry\u201d Smith Academic Practice Partnership will additionally give recipients the opportunity to complete an apprenticeship at Renown. To be eligible for the scholarship, students must be in good standing at the University of Nevada, Reno Orvis School of Nursing; Nevada residents; and committed to working at Renown for at least three years post-graduation. The Practice Partnership has been established by the Gerald Smith family and initiated by Stephanie Kruse, Renown Health Foundation board chair. Kruse made a generous planned gift to Renown Health Foundation to the Renown Nursing Excellence Endowment Fund. This was the lead gift for the endowment, after a significant cash gift to the Nursing Education Fund last summer. The daughter of a nurse, and a retired nurse herself, she understands the importance of attracting and retaining nurses within our healthcare system, and so she decided to honor the memory of her mother and provide funding for others interested in nursing. \u201cWe are incredibly grateful for the generous donors who have helped establish the Gerald \u2018Jerry\u2019 Smith Nursing Academic-Practice Partnership. These funds will not only impact the lives of the awarded nursing students, but positively influence the overall health of our community by ensuring that excellent healthcare professionals stay right here in northern Nevada. Jerry had a strong belief in community collaboration, and we are beyond proud to name this partnership in his honor,\u201d said Greg Walaitis, Chief Development Officer for Renown Health Foundation. According to a white paper published by the Nevada Health Workforce Research Center (the Center) in December 2022, analysis by the Center revealed persistent, widespread health professional shortages in Nevada. Despite steady growth in the number of new nursing graduates from Nevada nursing programs and registered nurses moving to Nevada from other states, the Center estimated that Nevada currently needs over four thousand additional registered nurses simply to meet the national population-to-RN average. The partnership allows the Orvis School of Nursing to expand its graduating classes by 8 additional students a year. \u201cAt Renown, we take pride in placing an emphasis on education and career development.
