Pero los tiempos cambian. Del 7 al 13 de octubre se celebra la Naturopathic Medicine Week (Semana de la Medicina Natur\u00f3pata o naturista), y la Oregon\u2019s Health CO-OP se convierte en la primera aseguradora del estado que cubre la atenci\u00f3n de primer contacto brindada por profesionistas naturistas, sin restricciones ni limitaciones de cobertura.\nEl evento encierra un reconocimiento de un campo profesional creciente que hay para los m\u00e9dicos que combinan la medicina tradicional con alternativas como la acupuntura y la herbolaria.\nLaura Farr, directora ejecutiva de la Oregon Association of Naturopathic Physicians (Asociaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9dicos Natur\u00f3patas de Oregon), opina que el hecho de captar los reflectores durante una semana entera demuestra que la profesi\u00f3n ha ganado respeto y popularidad por su enfoque curativo en el bienestar con opciones libres de drogas.\n\"Realmente es un gran paso para nuestra profesi\u00f3n, en t\u00e9rminos de reconocimiento federal, como profesi\u00f3n viable que francamente puede ayudar a resolver la falta de m\u00e9dicos de primer contacto que vive todo el pa\u00eds.\"\nOregon es uno de los 18 estados que expide licencias a m\u00e9dicos natur\u00f3patas, y el de Portland es el primero de los cinco colegios aprobados de medicina natural.\nFrecuentemente, los seguros m\u00e9dicos no cubren este tipo de atenciones o les ponen l\u00edmites y objeciones. Pero en Oregon eso tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 cambiando. Un plan de salud, el Oregon Health CO-OP, ya acepta a los naturistas reconocidos oficialmente por el estado, como m\u00e9dicos de primer contacto.\nEl Dr. Ralph Prows, quien encabeza la CO-OP, comenta que primero crearon una lista de habilidades que los natur\u00f3patas deben cumplir.\n\"Esas capacidades son, en todos los casos y aspectos, id\u00e9nticas a las que cualquier otro m\u00e9dico de primer contacto necesita tener antes de que lo contratemos, para que podamos asegurar la calidad de nuestros miembros. Esa lista de capacidades la elaboramos en mancuerna con la Asociaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9dicos Natur\u00f3patas de Oregon.\"\nProws considera que la decisi\u00f3n de incluir a los m\u00e9dicos naturistas se tom\u00f3 con base en solicitudes de los pacientes cuando se estaba formando la cooperativa. Agrega que algunos tratamientos naturop\u00e1ticos, como los suplementos herbolarios, todav\u00eda no est\u00e1n cubiertos en los planes de medicamentos recetados.\n[get more stories like this via email](/dn2.php)\nOpen enrollment begins soon for employer-sponsored health insurance for coverage starting Jan 1.\nMost people will have multiple options to choose from. Some are complex, so now is the time to do your research. According to the website USA Facts.org, about\n[7.5% of Indiana residents](https://usafacts.org/topics/health/state/indiana/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2092.5%25%20of%20Indiana's,least%20one%20health%20insurance%20plan.) do not have health insurance. Experts say it is important to shop for plans, see exactly what they offer, and if a choice fits a family's needs and budget.\nDr. Rhonda Randall, chief medical officer of Employer and Individual for UnitedHealthcare, said understanding some of the basic insurance jargon is a good place to start.\n\"Things like deductibles, copays, coinsurance, premiums, etc.,\" Randall outlined. \"Be familiar with what those terms are and what the costs associated with each one is for the plans that you're offered and the plans that you're considering.\"\nRandall advised paying close attention to out-of-pocket costs and monitoring changes which can occur within a plan each year. She suggested the online health insurance glossary\n[Just Plain Clear](http://justplainclear.com/en), which UnitedHealthcare has compiled. In 2021, [more than one-third](https://www.healthinsurance.org/states/health-insurance-indiana/) of Indiana's population was covered by public health insurance funded by governments at the federal, state or local level.\nNearly 17% of Indiana's population is 65 or older and eligible for Medicare. But it does not cover everything, so most people also buy a supplemental policy for added coverage, and a prescription drug plan. The Medicare annual enrollment period starts Oct. 15 and ends Dec. 7, when people can get new coverage or change what they've had.\nRandall noted UnitedHealthcare has also compiled an\n[online guide](https://www.uhc.com/medicare/medicare-education/medicare-guide.html) to help people navigate those plans.\n\"Medicare beneficiaries want to make sure they're understanding and learning the difference between original Medicare -- Medicare Parts 'A' and 'B' -- and Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part 'C' and 'D,' the prescription drugs,\" Randall explained.\nRandall encouraged Hoosiers to consider insurance plans including coverage for telehealth -- virtual 24-hours-a day, 7-days-a-week mental and behavioral health services, or management of chronic conditions, such as migraines, plus physical therapy and wellness visits.\nDisclosure: UnitedHealthcare contributes to our fund for reporting on Health Issues.

Gavin Newsom to sign four bills aiming to lower medical bills, improve transparency, and make health care more accessible.\n[Assembly Bill 665](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB665) would allow minors over age 12 to use Medi-Cal benefits for treatment they consent to on their own, while still allowing providers to involve a parent or guardian when appropriate.\nAngela M. V\u00e1zquez, policy director for The Children's Partnership, said teens may avoid getting help if they have to give intimate details to their parents.\n\"Surveys show that making parental opt-in mandatory reduces the likelihood that teens will seek timely treatment, especially among LGBTQ+, and youth of color,\" V\u00e1zquez reported.\nThe bill would also allow Medi-Cal to cover services even if the youth is not a danger to him or herself or the victim of child abuse or incest. Opponents say the bill interferes with parental rights.\nA\n[second bill](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB716) would stop surprise bills from out-of-network ambulance companies, instead requiring patients to pay only the in-network cost-sharing amount.\nDanielle Miele, a mom from Citrus Heights, said after her teenage son tried to take his own life, the hospital transferred him via ambulance to a treatment center several hours away, resulting in a huge bill.\n\"Within a month we received an ambulance bill of over $9,000,\" Miele recounted. \"Adding insult to injury, literally. Why is this practice commonplace? Why is it even considered acceptable?\"\nDebt collectors have objected to a section of the bill dealing with wage garnishment.\nA\n[third bill](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB616) would add physicians' groups of 50 or more to the list of organizations required to make public financial data they report to two state agencies.\nSonia Pellerin, a health care worker in Sacramento and a member of the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers, said it is a matter of transparency.\n\"With health care costs rising, we all deserve to know where our health care dollars are going and what's driving up the costs,\" Pellerin contended. \"Many times our patients are struggling to afford their health care. Those patients have the right to know how these medical groups are spending their money.\"\nMedical groups have called the bill an unnecessary layer of regulation. A fourth bill would extend Medi-Cal's\n[Comprehensive Perinatal Services Program](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB608) from 60 days to 12 months postpartum. The program helps arrange housing and food assistance, job training, and breastfeeding support. Opponents cite budget concerns.\n[get more stories like this via email](/dn2.php)\nIn the wake of the devastating overdose epidemic in North Carolina, the state's Department of Health and Human Services is stepping up to aid families and provide resources for youths battling substance abuse disorders.\n[State data](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/about/department-initiatives/overdose-epidemic) show in 2021 alone, overdose deaths in North Carolina spiked by 22%, and nationwide, teen overdose deaths rose by 20%.\nKelly Crosby, director of developmental disability and substance use services for the North Carolina Division of Mental Health, said recognizing many adults with substance use disorders start using during their teenage and young adult years, it is crucial to educate and support young people in preventing substance abuse and overdoses.\n\"In North Carolina, among kids 12 to 17 years old, around 5% had a substance use disorder in the past year,\" Crosby reported. \"That's more than 41,000 kids.\"\nCrosby pointed out the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated mental health challenges and substance use, with increased reports of anxiety, depression and substance misuse.\nSara Howe, CEO of Addiction Professionals of North Carolina, said to help address youth substance use challenges, a range of resources are available in the state. Some resources include education, harm reduction and treatment and mental health support.\nHowe noted parents can get additional help at\n[AlcoholDrugHelp.org](https://www.alcoholdrughelp.org/).\n\"They can look, they have a list of what they provide, what insurance they take, do they take Medicaid, do they take commercial insurance, and do they have intensive outpatient, residential,\" Howe outlined. \"This is a resource that we have right in our backyard that we can take advantage of today.\"\nResearch from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed other\n[protective factors](https://youth.gov/youth-topics/risk-and-protective-factors) to youth substance abuse disorder are family engagement, conversations around the disapproval of substance use, and mental health support.\n[get more stories like this via email](/dn2.php)", "language": null, "image":
