Is the person to be vaccinated sick today? \nThere is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy \nor increases vaccine adverse events. People with a moderate  \nor severe illness usually should not be vaccinated until their \nsymptoms have improved. Minor illnesses with or without fever \ndo not contraindicate use of influenza vaccine. Do not withhold \nvaccination if a person is taking antibiotics.\n2.  Does the person to be vaccinated have an allergy to a component \nof the vaccine?\nAll vaccines, including influenza vaccines, contain various \ncomponents that might cause allergic and anaphylactic reactions. \nNot all such reactions are related to egg proteins. However,  \nthe possibility of a reaction to influenza vaccines in egg-allergic \npeople might be of concern to both the person and vaccine \nproviders.\nAn egg-free recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) is available for \npeople age 18 years and older and an egg-free cell culture-based \nIIV (ccIIV, Flucelvax) is approved for persons age 4 years and \nolder. ACIP does not state a preference for the use of RIV for \negg-allergic people although some providers may choose to \nadminister RIV to their severely egg-allergic patients.\nReviews of studies of egg-culture based IIV and LAIV indicate \nthat severe allergic reactions to egg-based influenza vaccines in \npersons with egg allergy are unlikely. ACIP recommends that \npersons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only \nhives after exposure to egg should receive influenza vaccine. Any \nrecommended and age-appropriate influenza vaccine (IIV, RIV, or \nLAIV) may be used. Providers should consider observing all \npatients for 15 minutes after vaccination to decrease the risk for \ninjury should they experience syncope.\nPersons who report having had reactions to egg involving \nsymptoms other than hives, such as angioedema, respiratory \ndistress, lightheadedness, or recurrent vomiting; or who \nrequired epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention, \nmay also receive any recommended and age-appropriate \ninfluenza vaccine (IIV, RIV, or LAIV). The vaccine should be \nadministered in a medical setting (e.g., a health department or \nphysician office). Vaccine administration should be supervised \nby a healthcare provider who is able to recognize and manage \nsevere allergic conditions.\nInactivated influenza vaccines provided in multi-dose vials \ncontains thimerosal as a preservative. Most people who had \nsensitivity to thimerosal when it was used in contact lens solution \ndo not have reactions to thimerosal when it is used in vaccines. \nCheck the package insert at www.immunize.org/ fda for a list of \nthe vaccine components (i.e., excipients and culture media) used in the production of the vaccine, or go to  \nwww.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/\nappendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf .\nFor the 2019\u20132020 influenza season, no vaccine or packaging \ncontains latex.\n3.  Has the person to be vaccinated ever had a serious reaction  \nto influenza vaccine in the past? \nPatients reporting a serious reaction to a previous dose of \ninactivated influenza vaccine should be asked to describe their \nsymptoms. Immediate \u2013 presumably allergic \u2013 reactions are \nusually a contraindication to further vaccination against \ninfluenza. \nFever, malaise, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms most \noften affect people who are first-time vaccinees. These mild-  \nto-moderate local reactions are not a contraindication to future \nvaccination. Also, red eyes or mild upper facial swelling following \nvaccination with inactivated injectable influenza vaccine is  \nmost likely a coincidental event and not related to the vaccine. \nThese people can receive injectable vaccine without further \nevaluation.\n4.  Has the person to be vaccinated ever had  Guillain-Barr\u00e9 \nsyndrome?\nIt is prudent to avoid vaccinating people who are not at high \nrisk for severe influenza complications (see source 3) and who \nare known to have developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) \nwithin 6 weeks after receiving a previous influenza vaccination. \nAs an alternative, clinicians might consider using influenza \nantiviral chemoprophylaxis for these people. Although data are \nlimited, the established benefits of influenza vaccination for  \nthe majority of people who have a history of GBS, and who are  \nat high risk for severe complications from influenza, justify \nyearly vaccination. \nsources\n1.
