Zitter \nProfessor, Department of Plant Pathology \nCornell University \nIthaca, NY 14853 \ntaz1@cornell.edu \n  Fungicide resistance and multiple disease control will require growers to exercise caution in \nselecting fungicides for disease control in 2004.  Fungicide resistance is now known to exist for several \nimportant fungicides, and could affect the control of powdery mildew, gummy stem blight and downy \nmildew.  Resistance to strobilurin fungicides (Quadris [Quadris Opti and Amistar], Cabrio, and Flint) plus \nnewer fungicides with the same mode of action (famoxadone [Tanos], and fenamidone [Reason]) (all \nbelong to Group 11\n) is the result of a specific target site mutation, known as the G143A mutation.  As a \nresult of this mutation, there is diminished control with these fungicides, and the diseases in question \ncannot be controlled even when higher rates of the fungicides are used.  Resistance to powdery mildew \n(Podosphaera xanthii  [syn. Sphaerotheca fuliginea ] is now fairly common in the US, as is resistance to \ngummy stem blight ( Didymella bryoniae ).  Resistance to downy mildew ( Pseudoperonospora  cubensis ) \nis not reported in the US, but has been found in Europe and Asia.  If resistance to Quadris exists in your \narea, do not use any Group 11  fungicide including other strobilurins (Cabrio or Flint) or related products \n(Tanos or Reason).  Choose a fungicide  from a different fungicide class. \n All fungicides labeled for the control of cucurbit diseases are listed in Table 1, and are arranged \nby the fungicide group numbers assigned by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC).  \nFungicides that are protectant  in nature (page 1) have been assigned to group M  (for Multi-site activity) \nor have other means of activity.  These materials (ie. Bravo, maneb, mancozeb, fixed copper, sulfur) and \nothers (mineral oil and potassium bicarbonate) should be used in combination or alternated with materials \nhaving site specific  modes of action (pages 2 and 3).  Management and control for five specific diseases \nof cucurbits are given below. \n \nOomycete Diseases  \n Phytophthora Blight \nID\n: Phytophthora capsici.  The blight phase starts in lower areas of  fields with saturated soils; yeast-like \ngrowth may start on underside of fruit and spread to topside; (visible with the naked eye). \nCultural Practices : Management is critical ; organism survives in the soil for many seasons; rotate at least \n3 years out of susceptible crops (pepper, tomato, all cu curbits); avoid planting in fields with a history of \nstanding water; provide adequate drainage by sub-soiling and disking in spray alleys during the season; \nprovide means for water to exist fields away from surrounding susceptible crops. Chemical Control\n: Acrobat ( Group 15 ) tank mixed with a protectant fungicide labeled for the cucurbit of \ninterest (chlorothalonil, maneb or mancozeb, Groups M5 and M3 ) may provide some suppression of the \ndisease. \n \nDowny Mildew \nID: Pseudoperonospora cubensis :  Chlorotic spots appear on the upper leaf surface and purplish or gray \nspores form on these spots on the lower leaf surface. (visible with a hand lens) \nCultural Practices : None available; use the downy mildew forecast web site from the North Carolina State \nUniversity http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/pp/cucurbit/  to monitor movement. \nChemical Control : Consider using Acrobat ( Group 13 ) tank mixed with a protectant labeled for the \ncucurbit of interest (chlorothalonil, maneb or mancozeb, Groups M5 , and M3) and alternated with \nRidomil Gold Bravo or Ridomil Gold Copper ( Group 4 ) or Gavel ( Group 22 ) (only labeled on C, M SS, \nW) and use Bravo and maneb in alternate weeks; or consider Aliette ( Group 33 ) or Phostrol or ProPhyt \n(Group 33 ), combined or alternated with a protectant fungicide.  2  \nFungal Diseases  \n \nPowdery Mildew \nID: Podosphaera xanthii  (formerly Sphaerotheca fuliginea ) and Erysiphe cichoracearum :  Produces \nwhite powdery colonies on upper and lower leaf surfaces, on stems and petioles. (visible with the naked \neye) \nCultural Practices : Choose PM tolerant varieties for cucurbit of interest if available. \nChemical Control : Management of chemicals use for control is critical ; refer to Table 1  and make sure to \ntank mix protectant fungicides  (Group M5, M3, M1  or other chemicals (chlorothalonil, maneb, \nmancozeb, copper, oil, sulfur, etc.) with a strobilurin ( Group 11 ); or with demethylation inhibitors \n(Group 3 ) or thiophanate-methyl ( Group 1 ) and follow alternation protocol.  If resistance to Quadris \noccurs in the area, you must use a fungicide from different fungicide group.  \nGummy Stem Blight and Black Rot \n \nID\n: Didymella bryoniae :  Leaf symptoms are infrequent unless plants are infected during a wet growing \nseason; lesions if they develop are circular and may have black pepper-like specks which are pycnidia; \npycnidia also occur on lower stems and on fruit; fruit lesions may be water soaked and purplish in color before turning black; field infections often appear as a dry \u201cpetrified wood\u201d beige semi-circular lesion \nwith pycnidia. (visible with naked eye) \nCultural Practices\n: Use fungicide-treated seed, as organism is seedborne; rotate two years out of all \ncucurbits. \nChemical Control : Bravo ( Group 5 ) used alone or combined with Topsin M ( Group 1 ) will reduce \nchance for resistance from developing.   If resistance to Quadris occurs in the area, you must use a \nfungicide from different fungicide group. \n \nPlectosporium Blight (formerly Microdochium Blight) \n \nID: Plectosporium tabacinum  (previously Fusarium tabacinum ):  Light tan lesions that are spindle shaped \ndevelop on the underside of the leaf, which may lead to leaf distortion; spindle shaped lesions also appear on stems, petioles and fruit stems and also on fruit shoulders, where it appears a white, tan or silver russeting. (visible to the naked eye) \nCultural Practices\n: A soilborne pathogen recently introduced into Massachusetts and Connecticut, which \nin a moist season can result in considerable loses for pumpkin and summer squash.  The fungus prefers a depth of 2-4 inches; use of a no-till cover crop can reduce disease levels compared to bare ground culture. \nChemical Control\n: The protectant fungicide chlorothalonil (Bravo) ( Group M5 ) should be included in the \nspray program when fruit begin to set.  \nReferences \n \n1.

Zitter \nProfessor, Department of Plant Pathology \nCornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853 \n \n \nThe keys for the successful control of cucurbit diseases  are: 1) knowing the specific diseases that affect \nyour crop (most common are listed below) (3); 2) exercising the most important cultural practices (host resistance, \nclean seed, crop rotation, no-till cover crops, and soil mois ture management) (1, 2); and 3) choosing the most \nappropriate fungicides from the more than 20 fungicides cove red in Table 1 (protectants vs. specific fungicides with \na history or potential for fungicide resistance) (4). \n \nBacterial Diseases  \nBacterial Wilt  \nID: Erwinia tracheiphila  is the bacterium responsible for bacterial w ilt and replicates only in the xylem; wilt appears \ninitially on leaves and then on one or more runners on a pl ant; look for vascular browning in the xylem by cutting at \nthe grown level (crown of plant) (visible to the naked eye) Cultural Practices\n: Beetles will aggregate on preferred varieties (due to cucurbitacins levels); this feature makes use \nof a susceptible variety as a trap crop. \nChemical Control : Imidacloprid (Admire) is the preferred material for striped beetle control, but others are \nregistered. \n \nAngular Leaf Spot  \nID: Pseudomonas syringae  pv. lachrymans  Young spots are water-soaked and olde r spots may have holes in center; \nspots are usually limited by the main veins of leaves; circ ular water-soaked and then sunken spots appear on fruit. \n(both visible to the naked eye) Cultural Practices\n: Use pathogen-free seed and rotate out of cucurbits for 2 years. \nChemical Control : Use copper or a mixture of copper ( Group M1 ) plus maneb ( Group M3 ); discontinue sprays \nduring extended rain-free periods.  \nOomycete Diseases  \nPhytophthora Blight  \nID: Phytophthora capsici The blight phase starts in lower areas of fields with saturated soils; yeast-like growth may \nstart on underside of fruit and spread to topside; (visible with the naked eye). \nCultural Practices : Management is critical ; organism survives in the soil for many seasons; rotate at least 3 years out \nof susceptible crops (pepper, tomato, all cucurbits); avoid pl anting in fields with a history of standing water; provide \nadequate drainage by sub-soiling and di sking in spray alleys during the season; provide means for water to exist \nfields away from surrounding susceptible crops. \nChemical Control : Acrobat ( Group 15 ) tank mixed with a protectant fungicide labeled for the cucurbit of interest \n(chlorothalonil, maneb or mancozeb, Groups M5 and M3 ) may provide some suppression of the disease. \nDowny Mildew  \nID: Pseudoperonospora cubensis Chlorotic spots appear on the upper leaf su rface and purplish or gray spores form \non these spots on the lower leaf su rface. (visible with a hand lens) \nCultural Practices : None available; use the downy mildew for ecast web site from the North Carolina State \nUniversity http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/pp/cucurbit/  to monitor movement. \nChemical Control : Consider using Acrobat ( Group 13 ) tank mixed with a protectant labeled for the cucurbit of \ninterest (chlorothalonil, maneb or mancozeb, Groups M5 , and M3) and alternated with Ridomil Gold Bravo or \nRidomil Gold Copper ( Group 4 ) or Gavel ( Group 22 ) (only labeled on C, M SS, W)  and use Bravo and maneb in \nalternate weeks; or consider Aliette ( Group 33 ) or Phostrol or ProPhyt ( Group 33 ), combined or a lternated with a \nprotectant fungicide. \n  7 Fungal Diseases  \nPowdery Mildew  \nID: Podosphaera xanthii  (formerly Sphaerotheca fuliginea ) and Erysiphe cichoracearum Produces white powdery \ncolonies on upper and lower leaf surfaces, on stems and petioles. (visible with the naked eye) \nCultural Practices : Choose PM tolerant varieties for cucurbit of interest if available. \nChemical Control : Management of chemicals use for control is critical ; refer to Table 1  and make sure to tank mix \nprotectant fungicides  (Group M5, M3, M1  or other chemicals (chlorothalonil, maneb, mancozeb, copper, oil, \nsulfur, etc.) with a strobilurin ( Group 11 ); or with demethylation inhibitors ( Group 3 ) or thiophanate-methyl \n(Group 1 ) and follow alternation protocol.  If resistance to Quadris occurs in the area, you must use a fungicide \nfrom different fungicide group. \n \nGummy Stem Blight and Black Rot  \nID: Didymella bryoniae  Leaf symptoms are infrequent unless plants  are infected during a wet growing season; \nlesions if they develop are circular and may have black  pepper-like specks which are pyc nidia; pycnidia also occur \non lower stems and on fruit; fruit lesions may be water so aked and purplish in color before turning black; field \ninfections often appear as a dry \u201cpetrified wood\u201d beige se mi-circular lesion with pycnidia. (visible with naked eye) \nCultural Practices : Use fungicide-treated seed, as organism is s eedborne; rotate two years out of all cucurbits. \nChemical Control : Bravo ( Group 5 ) used alone or combined with Topsin M ( Group 1 ) will reduce chance for \nresistance from developing. \n \nWhite Mold  \nID: Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Look for white, cottony growth on stems and especially fruit; raisin-shaped black \nsclerotia appear within this gr owth. (visible with naked eye) \nCultural Practices : Rotate 3 or more years out of susceptible cr ops, choosing crops like sweet corn and grass cover \ncrops. \nChemical Control : For farms with short rotations, consider the bi ological product Contans for incorporation into the \nsoil prior to planting.  \nFusarium Crown and Fruit Rot  \nID: Fusarium solani  f. sp. cucurbitae  Crown of plant may be girdled and th e dark brown decayed area covered with \nwhite or pinkish colored fungal mycelium; tan or white circ ular lesions appear on side of fruit touching the ground. \n(visible to naked eye) \nCultural Practices : A soilborne fungus that survives in the soil for at least 2 years; rotation out of cucurbits for 3 \nyears. Chemical Control\n: None available \n \nPlectosporium Blight (formerly Microdochium Blight)  \nID: Plectosporium tabacinum  (previously Fusarium tabacinum ) Light tan lesions that are spindle shaped develop on \nthe underside of the leaf, which may lead to leaf distortion;  spindle shaped lesions also appear on stems, petioles and \nfruit stems and also on fruit shoulders, where it appears a wh ite, tan or silver russeting. (visible to the naked eye) \nCultural Practices : A soilborne pathogen recently in troduced into Massachusetts and Connecticut, which in a moist \nseason can result in considerable loses for pumpkin and su mmer squash.  The fungus prefers a depth of 2-4 inches; \nuse of a no-till cover crop can reduce disease levels compared to bare ground culture. Chemical Control\n: The protectant fungicide chlorothalonil (Bravo) ( Group M5 ) should be included in the spray \nprogram when fruit begin to set. \n \nAlternaria Leaf Spot or Blight  \nID: Alternaria cucumerina  Lesions first appear on the older crown leaves  as circular brown spots; as lesions expand \nthey develop concentric rings; more common on muskmelon than pumpkin or winter and summer squash. (visible to \nthe naked eye) Cultural Practices\n: Follow a 2-year rotation out of all cucurbits. \nChemical Control : Can be controlled with most protectant fungicides ( Groups M5, M3 and M1 ) and used in \nalternation with strobilurins ( Group 11 ) fungicides. \n  8 Anthracnose  \nID: Colletotrichum orbiculare  More likely to occur on muskmelon, watermelon and cucumber.  Appears as tan or \nbrown oval lesions on upper leaf surface; raised acervuli (often salmon-colored)  with hair-like setae (whiskers); \nlesions with fruiting bodies will also app ear on fruit. (visible with a hand lens) \nCultural Practices : Use disease-free seed; follow a 2-year rotation out of cucurbits.  Be mindful under moist \nconditions and high humidity for 24 hrs. \nChemical Control : Apply Bravo ( Group M5 ) alone or in combination with Topsin M ( Group 1 ) in alternation with \nGroup 11  fungicides (Quadris and Cabrio).  If resistance to Quadris occurs in the area, you must use a fungicide \nfrom different fungicide group. \n \nSeptoria Leaf Spot  \nID: Septoria cucurbitacearum  Initially appears as very small water-soaked spots which turn beige or white in color; \npycnidia (small black-pepper-like spots) appear inside the l eaf and stem lesions; raised rash-like white spots also \nappear on fruit of pumpkin and winter squash . (visible with naked eye or hand lens) \nCultural Practices : Following a 2-year rotation will eliminate most disease carryover.  Requires cool temperatures \nand summer rains to spread to fruit. \nChemical Control : Disease is controlled with a good fungicide program that includes Bravo ( Group M5 ). \n \nScab  \nID: Cladosporium cucumerinum  Young lesions are water soaked but when older turn tan with a yellow halo and \neventually crack and fall out; fruit lesions vary as cavity  or erumpent lesions on fleshy fruit (summer squash) or \nsunken dry and corky lesions on hard fruit (pumpkins and winter squash. (visible to the naked eye) \nCultural Practices : Use disease-free seed; follow a crop ro tation out of cucurbits for 2 years. \nChemical Control : Control is achieved with protectant fungicides like Bravo ( Group M5 ) and is especially needed \nduring cool and wet springs and summers. \n \nReferences  \n1.

Cucurbits include the major crops of cucumber (C), melon (M)(which includes \nmuskmelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew),  watermelon (W), summer squash (SS), winter squash (WS), \npumpkin (P), and gourds (G).  Because the various cucu rbits can differ in their susceptibility to diseases \nand insects, the letters  following each cucurbit shown above will be used to provide specific information \nthroughout this document .  Pest management information applicable to all cucurbits is presented in the \nfront of this document, followed by separate secti ons for each crop highlighting problems and thresholds \nunique to that crop.    \nA. General Scouting Information \n Cucurbit or vine crop fields should usually  be scouted in a systematic manner that places sample \nsites throughout most of the field.  However, some  exceptions apply as indicated in the disease and \ninsect sections below.  Sampling patterns will vary  depending on the shape of the field, but frequently a V-\n, W-, X-, or diamond shaped pattern adequately covers a field. These sampling patterns may not always \nbe feasible because of difficulty of walking through a vine crop (i.e. pumpkin) and the extra amount of time \nthat would be needed to follow a pattern.  A compromise is to walk through the field down a row. Remember, you are attempting to sample representative  sections of the whole field. Although the \nscouting procedures outlined here are rather rigidly stru ctured, remain alert to possible pest problems that \nmay not be detected by the systemat ic sampling plan and are noted as you walk from site to site.  \nUnhealthy appearing plants (e.g. yellow foliage, wilting plants, or plants with obvious insect chewing \ndamage) should be examined more closely.   If a scout has problems with a sampling scheme or  thinks that data being recorded on a scout form \nis not reflective of the real field situation, please bring this to the a ttention of the County Extension Agent \nor Regional IPM Specialist with whom they are working,  or with the Cornell Ext ension Plant Pathologist or \nEntomologist.  \nSpray Record: Always check the grower's spray record before entering the field.  It is important to \ncheck whether or not a pesticide has been applied recently, and if it is safe to enter the field.  Make sure your growers keep these records up to date.  Pesticides and Bees: Cucurbit crops require bees for pollination.  Be sure to caution growers not to use pesticides which may injure bees or inhibit their activity during pollination.  Some publications recommend the use of one hive per field to promote pollination.      \n \nB.  General Scouting Procedure:   \n \nEach time a field is scouted, chose 5 repres entative sites from which to make counts.  \nThe sites should vary from week to week  to increase the pr obability that localized \nproblems will be detected.  The plant parts  examined and sampling units will change as \nthe plants grow, vine, and form fruit.  Sampling sites should be chosen without bias, except in those disease\n cases where specific sites are important (for example, poorly \ndrained areas of the field, portions of a fi eld bordered by trees t hat might not dry off \nquickly following heavy dew or fog, etc.), and early in the season when scouting for \nstriped cucumber beetle. \n  15 C.  Insect Scouting Procedure \n Begin scouting for insects (striped cucumber beetle ) as soon as plants emerge or are transplanted.  \nOverwintered striped cucumber beetle adults can coloni ze a field very quickly and cause direct damage to \nemerging or newly transplanted plants, in addition to possibly transmitting bacterial  wilt.  Twice weekly \nscouting may be necessary while overwintered striped cu cumber beetle adults are colonizing fields.  Pay \nparticular attention to the edges of fields, where localized \u201chot spots\u201d of heavy damage may be found.  \nBefore plants begin to vine, inspect each of 5 plants for general  appearance and insect occurrence.  After \nplants vine and individual plants are i ndistinguishable, inspect 10 leaves and 5 fruit at each of five plant \nareas (10 sq. ft.) in the field, recording insect presence and damage.  \n \nD.  Disease Scouting Procedure (find crop specific procedures starting on page 11) \n \nAt the early part of the seas on as the plants begin to run\n (vine) or with bush types as they begin to flower , \nfor each field scouted, chose 5 representative sites from  which to make counts.  At each site inspect 2 \nolder leaves on each of 5 plants (one per hill if this  applies) for presence of each disease (during a wet \nspring particularly note presence of Septoria , scab, and angular and bacterial leaf spot, as subsequent \nfruit infection can occur ), and record how many plants are infected.   In the case of bacterial wilt, note \noccurrence of cucumber beetles as noted in Insect Section F .  A total of 50 leaves should be inspected \nfor the field.  After the ro ws close for the vining types (for bush types this timeframe would correspond to \nplants with fruit set and enlarging ), it is preferable to substitute 5 plant areas (10 sq. ft.), examining 10 \nleaves/area and 5 fruit at each location.  To aid in  finding the initial occurrence of powdery mildew, if \nsummer squash is planted in the vicinity, inspect thes e plantings first for the presence of mildew to \ndetermine when weather conditions are appropriate for mildew colonization.  Calculate and record the \npercent plants infected.  In addition, give each fiel d an overall disease severity rating for each disease \npresent according to the following scheme:   1 = first occurrence of the season on leaves  2 = few leaves (1-3) of each plant infected   3 = moderate number of leaves (3-8) infected on each plant, first occurrence on    stems and fruit  4 = each plant severely infected (9-all leaves), infected stems and fruit now   \n common  5 = total vine destruction with heavy fruit infection  \n The presence of all diseases except  Phytophthora blight, Fusarium crown and \nfoot rot, Fusarium wilt, and Sudden wilt will be evaluated on a percent plants infected \nbasis.  Phytophthora and Fusarium crown ro t and the wilt diseases will be noted when \npresent since they can be some what sporadic in their occurrence on a given farm. It is \nalso important that the different crops be scouted separ ately for purposes of disease \nevaluation; however, cross-infe ction is common, especially if  the different cucurbits are \ngrown in close proximity to one another. (see t he \u201cLocation of the Plant\u201d table as an aid) \n  16  The following table provides some info rmation of the generalized occurrence of \ndiseases, and suggestions for systematic sampling and action thresholds. \n \nInitially at  \nBorder Rows  \n Localized  Systematic Sampling & Action Thresholds 1 \nViruses, especially \nCMV introduced by \naphids (other viruses \nmay be more randomly \ndistributed)  Fusarium crown and \nfoot rot; \nPhytophthora blight; \npoorly drained \nareas of field  Angular leaf spot a, Bacterial leaf spota & Bacterial wilt d, \nScab a c & Septoria leaf spot a c, Powdery a & Downy \nmildewa, Alternaria leaf blight b, Gummy stem blight b & \nAnthracnose b, Plectosporium blight (formerly \nMicrodochium blight) b & Ulocladium leaf spot b \n(Fusarium crown and foot rot, Fusarium wilt & Sudden \nwilt can be scouted for, but no controls are available).  \n____________________ \n1Action thresholds \n a = symptoms on one leaf of 25-50 examined. \n b = preventative when fruit begin to devel op (GSB )or if symptoms are present. \n c = mean temperatures (58-64F for Septoria) (63-70F for Scab) with wet weather    \n  for spore dispersal and infection. \n d = monitor insect vectors to initiate treatment. \n  17  The following table can be used as an indication of  where to look on the plant for a particular \ndisease for signs or symptoms.

Varietal Resistance  \n \n1.)  Summer Squash \n \nIt is extremely important to note the variety of the cr op for disease evaluation.  Some varieties of several \ncucurbit crops are significantly more susceptible to  certain diseases than other varieties.  This is \nparticularly true for virus diseases, and their occurrence, degree of damage, and control can be \ninfluenced by the variety chosen.  This currently only applies to the following summer squash varieties. \n Variety    Reaction      \n \nYellow Str.

PUMPKINS AND VIRUS RESISTANCE \n \n(Thomas A. Zitter, Department of Plant Path ology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853) \n \n A large number of viruses can reportedly infect cucurbit crops including pumpkin grown in the \nNortheast US, and these are listed in Table 1.  Realis tically, the number of viruses that routinely infected \nthese crop plants is much lower.  However, the viruses that are underlined  in Table 1 are still some of the \nmost important disease problems facing grower s because of their wide spread occurrence. \n Since we do not feel that seed transmission plays a role in the spread of viruses with the \nexception of squash mosaic virus (later vectored by striped cucumber beetles), we need to look \nelsewhere for the virus source.  In addition to infe cting a diverse group of horticultural crops, plant \nviruses commonly infect many important weeds, which se rve as the principle reservoirs for these viruses.  \nA listing of some of the more important virus weed (crop) hosts appears in Table 2.  A more complete \nlisting of weeds as natural reservoirs for plant virus es in the Northeast can be found at the web site \n(http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/).  20  \nTable 1.

This is mainly beca use these types belong to different cucurbit species that generally \nare not as susceptible.  For the giant pumpkins ( C. maxima ) this includes Dill\u2019s Atlantic Giant and \nPrizewinner.  C. maxima  specialty types include orange skin Cinderella and Fairytale; white skinned \nValenciano and Lumina; slate gray skinned, Jarra hdale; and reddish skin Rouge Vif d\u2019Etampes.  C.  22 moschata  is represented by Long Island  Cheese.  Although these species are susceptible to the main \nviruses (CMV, WMV, PRSV, and ZYMV), infe ction will not result in a crop loss. \n \nMain Viruses  \nCucumber Mosaic Virus  (cucumovirus, aphid transmitted, not s eed transmitted in cucurbits, has many \nweed hosts) \n Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is the most commo n virus infecting cucurbits in the Northeast.  \nThe virus can infect more than 800 plant species worl dwide.  CMV is readily transmitted from perennial \nweeds by aphids in a nonpersistent method.  It is often the earliest virus transmitted in the spring.  \nImportant weed hosts include common milkweed (Per ennial), common chickweed (Winter Annual, but \ncan become perennialized in cool moist areas, also CMV is seedborne in this species), marsh yellow cress \n(A, Biennial, short-lived P), and yellow rocket (Win A,  Bie) and more.  As aphid populations develop on \nweeds and attractive crops during the spring and su mmer, extensive spread may occur.  Pumpkin plants \non the edge of fields and rows are frequently the first plants to be infected.  Destroy important weeds before the crop is estab lished in the field.  Intercropping with corn or \nother nonsusceptible tall barrier crops have been us ed keep virus from invading the crop.  Rouging \ninfected plants especially from the ends of rows before secondary spread occurs may be helpful.  \nBecause of the nonpersistent manner of transmission, co ntrol of aphids to prevent spread within the crop \nis not an option. \n \nWatermelon Mosaic Virus\n; Papaya Ringspot Virus ; Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus  (potyvirus, aphid \ntransmitted, not seed transmitted)  After the initial occurrence of CMV, these viruses co nstitute the main season threat for cucurbits.  \nAphids do not generally colonize cucurbits, and theref ore the movement of migrant aphids is responsible \nfor the majority of the seasonal spread.  Aphids tr ansmitted these viruses in a nonpersistent manner, and \nthe process of visiting potential food hosts for a shor t feeding periods fits perfectly into nonspecific virus \nspread.  These three viruses have a small host rang e of susceptible plants, and alternate weed hosts, \nalthough common in southern states, do not seem to pl ay a role as an overwintering reservoir here in the \nNortheast.  Rouging infected plants  especially from the ends of rows before secondary spread occurs may \nbe helpful.  Because of the nonpersistent manner of transmission, control of aphids to prevent spread \nwithin the crop is not an option. \n \nTomato Spotted Wilt Virus\n (tospovirus, thrips transmission, not seed transmitted, many weed hosts) \nTomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) causes brown sp otting or dark ringspots on foliage.  It is \nprobably a rare problem for cucurbits, but it included  since it can be a factor for certain vegetables \n(tomato, pepper, etc.) and for ornament als.  TSWV is transmitted by at least 8 species of thrips, with the \ntobacco thrips ( Frankliniella fusca ) and western flower thrips ( F. occidentalis ) considered to be the most \nimportant vectors.  Thrips acquire TSWV by feeding on infected plants only as larvae.  After a latent \nperiod of 3-7 days, they are then able to transmit th e virus to uninfected plants for the remainder of their \nlives.  TSWV has a host range in excess of 600 plant species, but many of these plants do not support \nthrips reproduction and are considered \u201cdead ends\u201d for virus spread. \nA recent survey of the role of weed hosts fo r TSWV and the tobacco thrips in North Caroline \nconcluded that key weeds included mouseear (P) and common chickweed (Win A, but can become \nperennialized in cool, moist areas), spiny sowthistle (A), dandelion (P), blackseed plantain (P), and a \nbuttercup species (A). \nSanitation around greenhouses is essential as  well as growing vegetable transplants in a \ngreenhouse separate from ornamentals that commonly serv e as reservoirs.  There is no cure for infected \nplants, which should be removed from the greenhouse or  the field as soon as they are detected.  SpinTor \n(spinosad) has been one of the most effective controls  for thrips on labeled cr ops (such as tomatoes and \npeppers) and applications on peppers for European corn borer will also pr ovide incidental control of thrips \npresent. \n  23 3.)  Powdery Mildew Resistance (Tolerance) in Pumpkin and Winter Squash and Multiple \nResistances in Cucumber. \n Resistance or tolerance to powdery ( Podoshaera xanthii , formerly Sphaerotheca \nfuliginea ) is now present in a number of pumpkin ( C. pepo ) and winter squash ( C. pepo ) \nvarieties. \nHybrid pumpkins  with tolerance to powdery mil dew include the following: Magic \nLantern, Merlin, Mystic Plus, Magician (als o ZYMV tolerance), and Aladdin.  The hard-\nshelled pumpkin used for painting (Lil\u2019 Ir onsides) has tolerance to Fusarium, \nPhytophthora, and other fruit rots.  The acorn  variety Autumn Delight has PM \nresistance, and Bush Delicata  and Taybelle PM (acorn type) have intermediate \nresistance to PM. \nMany slicing cucumber  varieties have multiple resist ances to bacterial, fungal \nand viral diseases and include the following: Dasher II, Daytona, Indio, Indy, Speedway, \nThunderbird and Turbo available from Petoseeds .  Resistant varieties available from \nHarris Moran include Raider, Greensleeves, St onewall, Orient Expr ess, Sweet Success, \nSalad Bush, Slice More, Diva, Burpless 26 Sweet Slice, and Marketmore 76. \n \nF.  Managing Fungicide Resistance for Powdery mildew, Gummy stem blight, and Downy mildew  \n Among cucurbit diseases, fungicide resistance is a concern especially for powdery mildew and \ngummy stem blight/black rot, and potentially for downy m ildew.   Systemic fungici des are typically at risk \nfor resistance development because they us ually have single site mode of action. \nStrains of the powdery mildew fungus resistant to  triadimefon (active ingredient in Bayleton and \nReach) and/or to benomyl (Benlate) have been found th roughout the United States, including New York.  \nStrains resistant to benomyl most likely are resistant  to other fungicides in this chemical group (e.g. \nTopsin M).  Where examined in 1996-1998, resistant strains were sufficiently  common before treatment \nthat these fungicides would have been marginally effe ctive or ineffective.  Therefore growers should \nswitch to new systemic fungicides  when they become registered.  Az oxystrobin (Quadris) was registered \nin 1999, and may be used throughout New York State.  Anot her strobilurin, Flint (trifloxystrobin), is now \nregistered on cucurbits and Cabrio (pyraclostrobin)  will be registered soon.  Similarly, the DMI \n(demethylation inhibitor) fungicides  myclobutanil (Nova) and triflumizo le (Procure) are registered. \nFungicide resistance to the Group 11 fungicides (strobilurins and others) is now common for \npowdery mildew and gummy stem blight in the US, and pot entially for downy mildew in the future.  If loss \nof control is noticed in the field, growers must stop the use of Group 11 fungi cides and switch to other \nfungicides that are still effective.   Strobilurins use should be limited to 1/3 of the spray program and \nalways combined with a protectant fungicide (Bravo or  maneb) or alternated with a protectant or with a \nproduct with a different mode of action (suggest using one of the DMI fungicides).  Strains of the gummy \nstem blight fungus resistant to both benomyl and thiophanate-methyl (Topsin M) have been identified \nrecently in New York and elsewhere in the eastern United States.  Azoxystrobin (Quadris) resistance to \nthe gummy stem blight is now common in many southern states in the US. \nStrains of the downy mildew f ungus resistant to metalaxyl (Ridomil) have been found in Israel.  \nFor this reason, Ridomil for foliar usage is formulated as  a mixture with protect ant fungicides that have a \nlow risk of resistance development (Bravo, mancozeb [Ridomil Gold MZ ], or copper).  Quadris, Cabrio, \nand Flint are also labeled for downy mildew c ontrol, and can be used unless resistance has been \nreported.  This disease requires periods of high humidity and rainfall and is more likely to occur on Long \nIsland and the lower Hudson Valley. \nThe following resistance management  strategies should be used: \n1. Reduce the need for fungicides by using other managem ent practices (e.g. resistant varieties).  2. \nApply systemic fungicides at-risk fo r resistance only when FIRST needed.  Scout weekly for symptoms to \nensure applications are made at the critical time, wh ich is the start of disease development.  3. NEVER \napply systemic fungicides like Benlate and Nova ALONE.  Use systemic fungicides in combination with a \ncontact protectant fungicide (chlor othalonil [Bravo] or other labeled formulation [OLF]).  4. Alternate \nbetween systemic fungicides (Quadris, Cabrio and Flint) with a product of different active ingredient like \nProcure or Nova.  5. Maximize spray coverage on leaf  undersurfaces if possible.  6. Limit the number of  24 applications of systemic fungicides by using contact fungicides at less critical times.  Each systemic \nfungicide should be used in no more than one-th ird of the total fungicide applications.  \n \nG.     General Insect Scouting Procedures  \n(find crop specific procedures starting on page 11)  \nThe following insects will be monitored in the 1999 cucurbit program, and are listed in order of \nimportance:   Striped Cucumber Beetle  Spotted Cucumber Beetle  Aphids   Seed Maggot \n Western Corn Rootworm \n Squash Bug  Squash Vine Borer (occasional pest in commercial cucurbits in NY) \n \nStart scouting as soon as seedlings start to  emerge or when plants are set out in the \nfield.  Inspect five plants at each of five locations in the field and record the number of \nstriped cucumber beetles per plant.  Later in  the season as plants vine and cannot be \ndistinguished, at five different locations in the field, examine 10 leaves and five fruit for \ninsects and signs of feeding damage. \n \nSeed maggot:  \n Areas in the field where seedling emergence is poor may indicate seed maggot injury.  Examine 5 \nto 10 seedlings in these areas and note if heavy root feeding is apparent.  Growing tips can be destroyed.  \nRecord percentage of plants damaged.  \n \nCucumber beetles and western corn rootworms : \nThe striped cucumber beetle can infest cucurbits shor tly after transplanting or as plants emerge from the \nsoil.  Infestation levels will continue to increase for about two weeks.  It is important to carefully monitor \nthe crop at this time, twice a week if possible, becaus e this is when plants are most susceptible to feeding \ndamage and disease transmission.  It is important to exam ine all plant surfaces.  Beetles most often feed \non the undersides of cotyledons, young leaves, and t he stem.  When on the undersides of cotyledons, \nfeeding damage is typically limited to the leaf surface, however they  will occasionally feed through the \nleaf, leaving holes.  Heavy feeding on older leaves resu lts in leaves appearing net-like, with only the veins \nremaining.   Some beetles (ca. 20%) will also  be found hidden in cracks in the soil and under rocks and \ndebris. Beetles may occur in concent rated \"hot spots\" at field edges. \n \nSecond generation striped cucumber beetles, spotted cucumber beetles, and western \ncorn rootworms infest cucurbits beginning in  mid-summer. These insects are less likely \nto cause economic damage directly to t he plants because by the time they appear \nplants are relatively mature and are more tolerant of damage.  Mid- to late-season \ninfestations can damage blossoms. If fruit se t is still occurring, treat if blossom damage \nis excessive.  All species have been reported causing damage to fruit late in the season. \n \nThresholds:  see individual crop sections below for striped cucumber beetle adult thresholds. \n \nRoot infestations : Striped and spotted cucumber beetles lay their eggs at the base of plants and the \nlarvae feed on roots.  Little is known about the impor tance of larval cucumber beetle feeding on growth \nand development of cucurbits.  Roots of small plants that appear  stressed should be examined for  25 cucumber beetle larvae.  The larvae are creamy whit e with a black head and \"tail\" and up to 3/8 inches \nlong. \n \nSquash bugs: \nWhile generally not a problem on young plants, if t he infestations are severe and feeding excessive, \nleaves on mature plants will appear \"blackened\" as if burned.  Adults and nymphs feed on leaves and \nstems with piercing mouthparts.  In the process, toxi ns are introduced into the plant, which interfere with \nnormal physiological activities.  Record if plants have been damaged by squash bugs.  There are no \nspecific treatment thre sholds for squash bugs. \n Watch for the orange-reddish squash bug eggs that are laid in clusters on the upper leaf surfaces.  \nNymphs will occur in aggregations on leaves, blossoms or elsewhere on the plants.  It is best to sample \nplants early in the day while relatively cool, as s quash bugs are very skittish when temperatures are hot.  \nAggregations occur under live and dead leaves  that are in contact with the soil.  Adults are often found at \nthe base of the plant near the soil line or between lar ge stems.  They also c an be found under dirt clods \nand other debris.  Wooden boards (ca. 12 in. X 12 in.) placed under plants can act as \"indicator traps\".  \nBugs will crawl under the boards for protection and can easily be counted.  Although some bugs will be \ntrapped, the number captured probably represents only a small percentage of the infestation present.   \n \n*Squash vine borer: \nWhile the squash vine borer is generally not a probl em in commercial plantings of cucurbits some \ndamage has been observed in recent years. The larv ae bore into the stems of squashes, pumpkins, \ngourds, cucumbers and muskmelons. Winter squash, (i n particular Hubbard), pumpkins, and zucchini are \nquite susceptible to borer damage.  Infested vines at  first exhibit wilting and later may be completely \ngirdled and rot beyond the point of attack. An infest ation may be detected by the presence of coarse, \nyellowish grains of frass (fecal matter) that collect  at the base of stems or on the ground under the vines. \nLater the frass becomes moist and shiny, and ma y be seen oozing from holes in the stems. \n \nBegin scouting fields in mid June.  Fields heavily infe sted last year, are more likely to have infestations \nthis year. If frass is seen, stems should be cut open to  confirm the presence of borer larvae. There are no \nspecific treatment thresholds fo r this pest, but if needed, two insecticide applications 5 to 7 days apart \nshould control newly hatched larvae. Several regist ered insecticides including Thiodan 50WP, Asana XL \nand Ambush should provide adequate control. It is important  to control larvae befor e they enter the stem, \nbecause once they enter the stem, insect icides have little effect.  If possible, direct the spray to the stems \nof the plants near the base for good control.  \n \nAphids:  Several species of aphids attack cucurbits, in particular melons and cucumbers.  They are the \nprincipal vectors of virus diseases and it only takes a few to introduce the virus into the crop.  Virus \nresistant varieties should be used w henever available.  See above dis ease section for information about \nviruses.  Sampling\n:  Aphids are typically found on the undersides of leaves and natural enemies (parasitoids, \npredators, and fungal diseases) are frequently associat ed with aphid colonies.  If aphids are present in \nadequate number, infested leaves will curl downward, tu rn brown and die.  Looking for wilted leaves is \none way of sampling for aphid infestations. Aphids ty pically do not cause significant direct damage until \nplants have started to produce runners.  Initial infe stations occur as isolated \"hot spots\".    \n Threshold\n: Examine ten leaves at each of five sites and re cord the number of leaves with five or more \naphids per leaf.  If more than 20 percent of the leaves  have five or more live aphids per leaf, a treatment \nmay be warranted.  Consider however, the presence of natural enemies.  If many of the aphids are \ninfected with fungal pathogens or are parasitiz ed (mummies), then treatment may not be needed. \n \nIf any questions arise, call your local Extension Agent, Regional IPM Specialist or Cornell Extension Entomologist.  26  \nThe following table can be used as a guide for where to look on the plant for an insect pest or its damage. \nLocation on the Plant \n \nInsect Leaves Stems Roots Blossoms Fruit \n      \nSeed Maggot - - X - - \n      \nStriped \nCucumber \nBeetle  X X X (larvae) X X \n      \nSpotted \nCucumber \nBeetle  X X  X X \n      \nWestern \ncorn \nrootworm X X - XX X \n      \nSquash Bug X X - X X \n      \nAphids  X \n(underside) - - - - \n \nH.   Weed Scouting Procedures:  \nMaking a Weed Map .  Weeds or weed species may not be ev enly distributed over a field.  Where \nlocalized areas of severe infestations are found or atypical conditions exist (poorly drained area, high \nspots, field edges), weed infestations may be reco rded on a weed map.  A weed map illustrates problem \nareas and provides information for future control dec isions.  When weed maps are kept over a period of \nyears for a given field, changes in location and population can be noted and control decisions adjusted \naccordingly.  Areas of severe infestations can be targeted for specific control practices, rather than \ntreating a larger area needlessly or failing to control problems at all.  First, make a rough sketch of the field, including landmarks, boundaries, crop ro w direction, compass \ndirections, roads, planting date, date of map prepar ation, and any other impor tant details.  Then the \nfollowing information should be indicated on the map:  Weed species, or if this is unknown, some effort shoul d be made to distinguish annuals from perennials, \nand broadleaf species from grasses and from yellow nutsedge.   Abundance  of each species estimated according to the fo llowing system:  0 = None; 1 = Scattered, few \nweeds; 2 = Slight, 1 weed /6 row feet;  3 = Moderate,  1 weed/3 row feet; 4 = Severe, > 1 weed/3 row feet \nDistribution  of weeds in the field is important and can be rated as follows:  SPOTTY - found in a few \nplaces around the field; LOCAL - found in a small portion of the field; GE NERAL - found throughout the \nfield    Weed size - The following size ratings can be used:  WHIT E SPROUTS - seeds are just germinating or \nemerging; TINY - weeds show only cotyledons or firs t true leaf; SMALL - weeds less than 1\" tall or less \nthan the diameter of a quarter; LARGE - weeds more t han 1\" tall or more than the diameter of a quarter. \n Throughout the season, at least two weed maps should be prepared.  Timing should be as follows: \n1. Early - soon after planting:  Purpose: to evaluate the success of t he current season program.  27  \n2. After Harvest.  Purpose: to ev aluate next season's weed control needs. \nSCOUTING PROCEDURES AND THRESHOLDS FOR CUCUMBERS \n \nDiseases to be Scouted \nThe importance of each disease for a parti cular cucurbit crop is given, where NA = not applicable \n(resistant varieties exist, as noted,  or plants are not susceptible); X = occurs, but not damaging levels; XX \n= moderate susceptibility; XXX = severe. \n * = Can occur every season in New York \n \nBacterial  \nNA, Res.  Angular leaf spot  - Most cucumber varieties are resistant, so if leaf spots occur on cucumber, \nthe disease could be Ulocladium leaf spot (see below); ALS is most common still on WS. \n \n* XXX  Bacterial wilt  \u2013 Can infect all cucurbits except watermelon and gourds - Control is based upon \ncontrol of the cucumber beetle vector. (see Insect Section)  Fungal\n \nX Downy mildew  - Infects all cucurbits, but pathotypes vary - Inoculum in troduced into the area; requires \nwarm and moist conditions for infection and s ubsequent spread; most common on Long Island and the \nlower Hudson Valley \n \n* XX Ulocladium leaf spot  \u2013 Only infects C - Choose resistant va rieties; not to be confused with angular \nleaf spot which requires different spray strategies  \nInsect Scouting and Thresholds \nEmergence to four-leaf-stage : This is the most critical time fo r monitoring and decision-making for these \npests.  For each field, choose 5 representative sites fr om which to make counts.  At each site inspect 5 \nplants (one plant per hill) and record the number of  beetles observed. A total of 25 plants should be \ninspected for the field. Calculate the average number of beetles per plant.  Watch for distinct \"hot spots\", \nand if detected, consider spot tr eatments.  The following recommendati ons are based on work at Cornell \nand at Purdue University. \n \nCucumber beetle thresholds: \nCucumbers are susceptible to bacterial wilt which is  vectored by cucumber beet les.  When scouting, pay \nparticular attention to field edges while plants are small.  \n \nCotyledon to 4-leaf stage:  If plants along the edge are heavily damaged or have \u226510 beetles/plant an \ninsecticide should be applied within 24 hours. Thereafte r, the fields only need to be treated if the average \nnumber of beetles per plant is \u22651. \n \nFifth leaf stage to harvest :  Because it is very difficult to accurately assess cucumber beetle and \nrootworm infestations in cucurbit s once plants have several leaves, it is simplest to give the field an \noverall subjective rating.  If feeding damage to leaves  is very apparent throughout the field or blossoms \nare heavily infested and being damaged during peak bloom or young fruit are being feed upon, a \ntreatment may be necessary.  If the infestation occurs a fter most fruit is set, then the need to control is not \nas important.  Late infestations can occasionally cause damage to mature fruit, but this is readily \nobserved when walking the field.  If feeding on mature fruit or fruit handles is noted and is of concern, a \ntreatment may be warranted.  28 SCOUTING PROCEDURES AND THRESHOLDS FOR MELONS \n \nDiseases to be Scouted \n \nThe importance of each disease for a parti cular cucurbit crop is given, where NA = not applicable \n(resistant varieties exist, as noted,  or plants are not susceptible); X = occurs, but not damaging levels; XX \n= moderate susceptibility; XXX = severe. \n *  Can occur every season in New York \n Bacterial\n \n* XX Bacterial wilt  \u2013 Can infect all cucurbits except watermelon and gourds - Control is based upon \ncontrol of the cucumber beetle vector.

If feeding on mature fruit or fruit handles is noted and is of concern, a \ntreatment may be warranted.     33 SCOUTING PROCEDURES AND THRESHOLDS FOR WINTER \nSQUASH, PUMPKINS, AND GOURDS \n \nThe importance of each disease for a parti cular cucurbit crop is given, where NA = not applicable \n(resistant varieties exist, as noted,  or plants are not susceptible); X = occurs, but not damaging levels; XX \n= moderate susceptibility; XXX = severe.   \n * = Can occur every season in New York \n \nDiseases to be Scouted  \nBacterial  \nX Bacterial leaf spot  - P, WS, G, and perhaps other cucurbit s - Disease occurred on these crops in \n1995, and was readily spread by over head irrigation.  Early diagnosis can therefore be important to \nprevent fruit infection.  Sympto ms on foliage may easily be overlooked.  \n * XX Bacterial wilt  \u2013 Most cucurbits including P \u2013 Watermelon and gourds are immune; control is based \nupon control of the cucumber beetle vector. (see Insect Section)  Fungal\n \n* X Anthracnose  \u2013 Can infect all cucurbits including P, WS, but pathotypes vary - A problem during warm \n(hot) seasons with adequate rainfall and high relative humidity.  X Fusarium crown and fruit rot \u2013 Most common on P and WS - A soilborne pathogen, it can cause a \ncrown or foot rot of many cucurbit seedlings, or a fruit rot of pumpkin and winter squash; control based on \n3 year rotation  \n XX Downy mildew  - Infects all cucurbits, but pathotypes vary - Inocul um introduced into the area; \nrequires warm and moist conditions for infecti on and subsequent spread; most common on Long Island \nand the lower Hudson Valley.  * XX Gummy stem blight (black rot on fruit)  - P, WS, G (primarily) - Symptoms can be variable on \nleaves, often without characteristic fruiting bodies which appear as black dots (pycnidia or perithecia of \nfungus).  * XX Phytophthora blight  \u2013 All cucurbits affected - Soilborne disease dependent on excess moisture \n(rainfall or irrigation) to spread inoculum  in poorly drained areas of the field. \n XX Plectosporium Blight (formerly Microdochium blight) \u2013 This soilborne fungus prefers a depth of 2-4 \nin. and is most damaging in a moist season.  Use of a no-till cover crop can reduce disease levels \ncompared to bare ground culture. \n \n* XXX Powdery mildew  \u2013 All cucurbits - Occurs every season begi nning first on older leaves in crown of \nplant.  Some pumpkin varieties have good levels of resistance.  XX Scab  \u2013 All cucurbits including WS, P, G - Import ant at beginning and during a cool and wet season; \nearly control will reduce fruit infection wh ich can be serious for SS, P, WS, and G. \n \nXX Septoria leaf spot  - WS, P - Important at beginning and duri ng a cool and wet season; scout for 1-2 \nmm whitish spots with black pycnidia (or water-soak ed spots if frequent rains have occurred); control in \nthe foliar phase will reduce chance of fruit infection    34 Viral \n* XX Cucumber mosaic  \u2013 All cucurbits are susceptible \u2013 Usua lly the first virus infecting pumpkin. \n * XX Watermelon mosaic  \u2013 All cucurbits including WS, P, and G.   Especially common on mini-pumpkins \nwhere it causes color-breaking. \n \nX Papaya ringspot-type W  \u2013 All cucurbits -  \n \nX Zucchini yellow mosaic - All cucurbits -  \n \nInsect scouting and thresholds \n \nMonitoring and thresholds for cucumber beetles : \n \nEmergence to four-leaf-stage : This is the most critical time fo r monitoring and decision-making for these \npests.  For each field, choose 5 representative sites fr om which to make counts.  At each site inspect 5 \nplants (one plant per hill) and record the number of  beetles observed. A total of 25 plants should be \ninspected for the field. Calculate the average number of beetles per plant.  Watch for distinct \"hot spots\", \nand if detected, consider spot tr eatments.  The following recommendati ons are based on work at Cornell \nand at Purdue University. \n \nCucumber beetle thresholds : These cucurbits are not highly susceptible to bacterial wilt and can \nwithstand feeding damage. Research has shown that pumpkin can tolerate 80% leaf loss when plants \nhave <5 leaves, without a yield loss.  In contrast, winter squash is sensitive to leaf feeding damage. If \ndistinct \"hot spots\" are detected, spot treat if possible. The lik elihood that feeding damage will affect yield \ndecreases as plants mature.  The preference of  summer squash (in 1992), and summer squash, winter \nsquash, and pumpkin (in 1995) by beetles are shown in tables provided in the appendix. \n \n  P u m p k i n :  \u22655 beetles/plant \n \n  Winter squash: \u22652 beetles/plant \n \nNote:  In areas in which bacterial wilt was found in previous seasons (Niagara, Erie, Monroe, \nYates, Oswego, Madison, Orange, Ulster, Dutchess, Columbia and Suffolk counties), use the melon and cucumber threshold until we have more information about the disease.  \nFifth leaf stage to harvest :  Because it is very difficult to accurately assess cucumber beetle and \nrootworm infestations in cucurbit s once plants have several leaves, it is simplest to give the field an \noverall subjective rating.  If feeding damage to leaves  is very apparent throughout the field or blossoms \nare heavily infested and being damaged during peak bloom or young fruit are being feed upon, a \ntreatment may be necessary.  If the infestation occurs a fter most fruit is set, then the need to control is not \nas important.  Late infestations can occasionally cause damage to mature fruit, but this is readily \nobserved when walking the field.  If feeding on mature fruit or fruit handles is noted and is of concern, a \ntreatment may be warranted.

Zitter \nProfessor, Department of Plant Pathology \nCornell University \nIthaca, NY 14853 \n \nIntroduction  \n Disease control measures taken in high tunnel structures  is not that much different from those undertaken in \ngreenhouse environments, but there are some important differe nces.  The environment is not as stable as that found \nin greenhouses and requires more daily time inputs and more  planning when the facility is constructed.  Daily \nraising and lowering of the plastic sides each morning and evening will provide the necessary control of temperature \nand humidity.  High tunnel orientation is critical to ensure  movement of prevailing winds through the tunnel sides.  \nSince high tunnel units should be perceived as semi-permane nt, they should be situated on the best well-drained soil \nand with the appropriate pH and nutrient adjustments made pr ior to crop establishment.  Use of raised, plastic mulch \ncovered beds with drip irrigation ta pe buried beneath each bed will afford soil warming and more precise soil \nmoisture control.  Sustainable plant protection practices used in concert with adequate planning will provide the \ndesired level of disease control. \n \nSustainable Control Practices  \n 1.  Best Crop Growth Practices:  Maintaining op timum crop growth by providing adequate nutrients and \nsoil moisture will allow plants to grow without interrupted growth that otherwise could favor disease development.  \nDo not provide over-rich soils that lend themselves to rank plant growth and likely bacterial infections to tomato pith tissue. \n 2.  Manipulation of the Environment:  Temperature and humidity are the two main factors that must be \nconsidered.  The length of time above 90% relative humidity should be limited as high humidity favors many \ndisease pathogens.  The operator needs to provide high tunne l ventilation as early and as late in the day by raising \nand lowering the plastic sides.  It is also necessary to pr ovide adequate drainage around the base of the structure to \nmake sure no water flows or seeps into the high tunnel.  Wet soils promote the development of soil borne and foliar \ndiseases. \n 3.  Disease Resistant Varieties:  Always choose diseas e-resistant varieties whenever  possible.  Also select \nvarieties that tolerate diseases especially in high-tunnel culture. \n 4.  Disease-free Seed and Tr ansplants:  Make sure to start with dis ease-free seed or tran splants.  Seed can \ncarry bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens, so seed needs to be purchased from reputable dealers, or should be \ntreated by the grower before s eeding.  Be especially mindful of tomato and pepper seed than carry bacterial speck, \nspot and canker.  The same care should be exer cised in the growing of healthy transplants. \n 5.  Crop Rotation:  If several high tunnel units are to be used, then rotation of crops between structures is \npossible.  If soil-borne pathoge ns reach an unacceptable level, it may be nece ssary to consider soil fumigants or even \ngrafting plants onto resistant rootstock.  Grafting is commonly employed for solanaceous and cucurbitaceous crops \nin many areas where susceptible crops are grown in the same facility on an annual basis.  6.  Sanitation In and Around the Structure:  Remove and destroy any disease tissue as soon as it is found.  \nDo not allow workers to move freely between high tunnels and field production areas with contaminated clothes and \nfoot ware.  When the crop is finished, remove and destroy all plant material including the roots.  Do not allow any \nvolunteer plants to become established in  the structure at any time.   Volunteer weeds can be  a source of insects like \naphids and thrips that can also serve as vectors of vi rus diseases.  Maintain a crop and weed free area around all \npermanent structures to reduce the movement of insects and pathogens into the sheltered area. \n 7.  Soil Fumigants and Fungicides as Needed:  Use of  rotation, sanitation, and clean plant materials should \nminimize the need for soil fumigants and foliar sprays.  Still it is not always possible to keep all pathogens out of the \nstructure, and some use of fungicides may be necessary.  \nPotential Disease Problems and Their Control  \n Powdery Mildew:  Powdery m ildew of cucurbits caused by Podosphaera xanthii  (formerly Sphaerotheca \nfuliginea ) and Erysiphe cichoracearum can be expected if cucurbits are grow n in tunnels for any extended period of \ntime.  Mildew produces white powdery  colonies on upper and lower leaf surfaces, on stems and petioles, and \ncolonies are visible with the naked ey e.  Powdery mildew development is favored by dry plant surfaces.  In high  37 tunnel production, the time that plant surfaces remain wet is considerably shorter than fo r plants grown in open field \nculture.  Although nighttime dew formation is favored out-of- doors, in tunnels the plastic covering slows the amount \nof radiation cooling of the plant su rfaces, lessening dew formation, and crea ting an ideal environment for powdery \nmildew to develop.  Powdery mildew of tomatoes (cau sed by another mildew species) is also commonly seen in \nhigh tunnel facilities, and may infect ot her solanaceous crops and weeds and other crop species.  Infected rosemary \nhas been implicated as the source of powdery mildew in tomatoes.  Contact fungicides do a reasonable job of \ncontrolling mildew if an effort is ma de to cover all plant surfaces, applying them on a 5-day sche dule, and beginning \napplication as soon as infection is f ound.  Mineral oils (JMS Stylet Oil) and potassium bicarbonate (Armicarb, \nMilStop, and Kaligreen) have been used.  Systemic fungicide s such as the strobilurins (Quadris and Flint) and the \ndemethylation inhibitor Nova can be eff ective tools for mildew control.  Becau se these are site-specific fungicides, \nthey are prone to the development of resistance and should be alternated with the protectant materials given above, \nand if they prove ineffective after applica tion, any further use should be discontinued. \n Foliar Blights:  If proper steps have been taken to  reduce humidity and moisture condensation, the number \nof foliar diseases that occur should be minimal, including common early blight of tomato.  Late blight has been \nreported in tunnels if high humidity exists .  If late blight should occur, immediately remove any infected tissue and \nallow the house to dry out.  Quadris performs quite will on late blight as does Phostrol mixed with mancozeb.  \nProducts should be alternated and applied on a 5-day schedule until the disease has been eradicated. \n Soil Borne Diseases:  These diseases should not be an  issue if protective steps of rotation and sanitation \nhave been followed.  Soil fumigants such as Vapam HL or K-Pam HL are multipurpose soil fumigants that provide \nboth disease and nematode control. \n Virus Diseases:  Use of virus resistant varieties and virus-free seed should reduce the chance for viruses \nlike tobacco mosaic virus in tomato and pepper.  Cl ean sanitation around tunnels of common weeds like common \nchickweed, milkweed, spiny sowthistle, dandelion, and blacks eed plantain will eliminate the buildup of insects, and \nthe chance spread of viruses like cucumber mosaic (CMV) and tomato spotted wilt (TSWV).  38  \nSITUACION SANITARIA DEL CU LTIVO DE ZAPALLO EN URUGUAY \n \nPablo Gonz\u00e1lez; Mar\u00eda Montelongo; Luciana Rauduviniche \nC\u00e1tedra de Fitopatolog\u00eda \u2013 Facultad de  Agronom\u00eda \u2013 fitopato@fagro.edu.uy \nSerrana Sollier; Fernanda Zaccari \nC\u00e1tedra de Horticultura \u2013 Facultad de Agronom\u00eda \u2013 horti@fagro.edu.uy \n \nEl zapallo cultivado en nuestro pa\u00eds er a en su totalidad del tipo criollo ( Cucurbita pepo ), sembrado a \npartir de poblaciones locales de semillas. A partir de los 90 se produjo la introducci\u00f3n en el mercado de los zapallos tipo kabuti\u00e1 ( Cucurbita maxima  x Cucurbita moschata ), cuya superficie lleg\u00f3 a representar el \n80 % del \u00e1rea sembrada de zapallos (Carballo 2001).

En las ev aluaciones realizadas en \nzapallos tipo kabuti\u00e1, se determin\u00f3 que las principal es p\u00e9rdidas durante el almacenamiento son debidas a \nproblemas sanitarios( Pacheco 1999).

During the past 10 years, tomato transplants have \nbeen implicated in the introduction of the following dis eases into the field: Bacterial spot and speck, \nbacterial canker, Septoria leaf spo t, early blight, leaf mold (Fulvia fu lva), Botrytis gray mold, and tomato \nspotted wilt virus (TSWV).  The originating source s for these diseases have included infected transplants, \ntomato seed, tomato crop debris from a previous cr op, and perennial plants that serve as a reservoir for \nthe infectious organism.  A recent example of a per ennial crop serving as a reservoir for a new powdery \nmildew ( Oidium neolycopersici ) affecting a greenhouse tomato production operation was Rosemary herb \nseedlings grown in the same greenhouse. \nThe standard recommendation for the control of bacteri al diseases is the use of clean seed that has \nbeen commercially treated with diluted hy drochloric acid, sodium hypochlorit e, or a hot water treatment to \nensure disinfestation.  Additionally, sterilized soil,  potting mixes, pots and flats should only be used.  \nPlants should not be topped. \nSanitation is important in the avoidance of greenhouse fungal diseases.  Greenhouses should be free \nof plant debris which may serve as an inoculum source .  High relative humidity is a major contributor for \ndisease development; for example, tomato leaf mold does not occur if relative humidity is below 85%. \nManage gray mold and leaf mold by removing dead plant tissue and by reducing humidity (water \nplants early in day, don't crow d plants together, increase air circulation by opening vents). \nTomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) can be a major probl em in the field if transplants are infected in the \ngreenhouse.  To avoid infection in the greenhouse, gr ow tomato transplants in a separate house from \nornamentals.  A number of thrips species can vector TSWV. \n \n \nRotate away from solanaceous crops for a minimum of two years.   \nIf stakes are to be re-used, they should be steamed or  washed with a disinfectant, and allowed to air dry \nbefore use.  Do not re-use twine. \nPrune plants by snapping off suckers at the base.  Do not clip. \nDo not enter fields if leaves are wet or  if guttation droplets have not been withdrawn. \nClean and disinfect all equipment that has entered in fested fields, and allow to air dry before use. \nBury infested plant debris in the soil to speed t he decline of the bacterial population in the soil. \n \n Transplants  should be inspected for symptoms of bacterial diseases (bacterial s peck, spot, or canker) \nbefore planting.  Inspect 5-10% of transplants, distributing your sample s across many flats, and \nconcentrating on the lower leaves, or call the NYS D ept. of Ag. and Markets for an inspection.  Do not \nplant transplants with signs of bacterial diseases!  Cu ll out infected transplants, or consider rejecting the \nshipment if disease levels are unacceptably high.  Remember that bacteria can exist on plants as \nepiphytes (leaf surface inhabitants) , meaning that symptoms may not be expressed until some weeks \nafter transplanting to the field.   Transplants shi pped in from a southern state should be inspected for \nsymptoms of late blight using the procedure described above.  \nTomato fields  should be scouted in a systematic manner that places sample sites throughout the field.  \nSampling patterns will vary depending on the shape of t he field, but frequently a V-, W-, X-, or diamond \nshaped pattern adequately covers a field.  Sample 5 consecutive plants at each sampling location. \nSampling sites should be chosen without bias, except in those cases where specific sites are designated \n(for example - Anthracnose).  Although the scouting pr ocedures outlined here is rather rigidly structured, \nremain alert to possible pest problems that may not  be detected by the system atic sampling plan and are \nnoted as you walk from site to site.  Keep your eyes on the crop at all times!  42 For fresh market tomatoes:   Inspect 5 groups of 5 plants per field for field\u2019s \u22642A.  Inspect 5 additional \nplants for each additional 1/2-acre. \nFor processing tomatoes:   Inspect 10 groups of five plants per field. \n \nWhile the TOMCAST disease forecasting system w ill require monitoring weather at least twice per \nweek, the procedures outlined for other  pests should be followed once per week per field.  The once per \nweek scouting can be delayed until the second week of  June unless the transplants are of poor quality. \n \nSpray Record:  Always check the grower's spray record  before entering the field.  It is important to \ncheck whether or not a pesticide has been applied recently, and if the re-entry interval (REI) has \npassed.  Make sure your growers keep these records up to date. \n \n1. Crop Growth Rating: \n  Record the stage of growth and plant height on the scouting report form according to the \nfollowing:  \nvegetative  (no blooms or fruit) \nfirst bloom first fruit set \nfruit size \nfirst ripe fruit  2. Colorado Potato Beetle: \n \nRESISTANCE MANAGEMENT: \nThe Colorado potato beetle has demonstrated a re markable ability to develop resistance to new \ninsecticide chemistries.  To prolong the life of the currently effective material imidacloprid (Admire and \nProvado) consider the following resistance management practices: \n1)  Rotate fields to reduce CPB pressure \n2)  Never rely exclusively on Admire/Provado fo r your insect management program.  Always use \n these products in concert with  other management tools including non- chemical tactics (see  below) \nand other insecticides. 3)  Do not use Provado on a field or part of a fi eld that was treated with Admire at planting. \n4) For non-rotated fields, do not use Admire or Provado more than once every two years. \n5) Use insecticide only when needed; i.e.  when an action threshold is reached. \n6) Do not use Provado just prior to dispersal of summer adults to winter hibernation sites. \n7) Never use Admire/Provado strictly for contro l of aphids; other equally effective materials are \n available.  \nALTERNATE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES:   \n \nDistance Rotation:   Rotate solanaceous crops attractive to Colorado potato beetle (CPB) (eggplant, \npotatoes, tomatoes) as a block, and plant as far away from previous year's planting as possible.  With \nenough distance, overwintered adults will colonize t he field much later and in much lower numbers. \n \nTrench Traps:   (especially useful when long distance rotation not feasible)  U or V shaped, steep-\nsided  black plastic lined trenches along the edge of the fi eld nearest the source of overwintering adults.  \nAdults disperse mainly by walking early in the season, and are unable to esc ape from trenches once they \nfall in.  A video tape and bulletin describing the use of trench traps is available from Cornell Cooperative \nExtension of Suffolk Co., 246 Griffing Ave., Riverhead, NY  11901. \nTrap Cropping:   (especially useful when long distance ro tation is not feasible) Plant eggplant or \npotatoes in early May along the field border closest to previous season's plant ings of tomatoes or \npotatoes.  If using potatoes, plant only sound, unblemis hed, certified seed potatoes to avoid introducing  43 late blight inoculum or seedborne viruses (espec ially potato virus Y and potato leafroll virus).  \nOverwintered CPB adults will be prefer entially attracted to the trap crop.   Treatment options for trap crop \ninclude:  propane flaming (potatoes only), or the use of an effective insecticide.  If using potatoes, harvest \ntrap crop as new potatoes or destroy as soon as overwintering adults have disappeared to \nminimize possibility of late blight  infection, or spray with fungicides on an interval sufficient for \nlate blight control on potatoes . \nBorder Treatments:   Treat border rows with Admire at  planting to prevent movement of \noverwintering adults into field.  Tolerate damage fr om the few adults that manage to get past the border; \ndo not treat with Provado. \n SCOUTING: \nEarly in the season, as overwinter ing adults are moving into fields, c heck border areas of fields.  If hot \nspots are found on field borders, applying insecticides  only to the borders of the field can delay the \nnecessity for spraying the entire field, resulting in  considerable insecticide and economic savings for the \ngrower.  \nExamine entire plant, including fruit if present, and count the number of adults, small larvae (1st and \n2nd instars), and large larvae (3rd and 4th instars) , and presence or absence of fruit feeding on each \nplant.  Estimate defoliation to the nearest 10%.  Try to distinguish between CPB egg masses (eggs \ngenerally larger, more orange, less orderly ) and those of the predaceous lady beetle Coleomagilla \nmaculata  (eggs smaller, lighter yellow, eggs neatly arranged on end).  Refer to fact sheet 760.00 and \nNatural Enemies of Vegetable Insect Pests  for details of the insects. \n \nReport the mean number of small larvae, large la rvae, and adults per plant, presence or absence of \negg masses or fruit feeding, and % defoliation on the scout ing report form.  Indicate any \"hotspots\" of \nCPB infestation in the field in comments area.   \n THE FOLLOWING THRESHOLDS ARE STI LL IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE. \nThresholds are for established transplants  only. Growers should check plants every other day until \ntransplants are well established and over transplant shock.  \nPROCESSING FIELDS \nPlants up to 10\":\n Average of 1.5 adults/plant, or defoliation \u226520% \n \nPlants 10\" to early fruit set:  If using Bt's: \n \u226510% of plants infested with egg masses, and \u226530% of egg \n masses have hatched. \n \n If using conventional insecticides: \n Average of 2 adults or larvae/plant, or defoliation \u226520% \n \nEarly Fruit set to fruit maturity:  \u226510% defoliation or \u22652% plants with at least one freshly \n injured fruit  \n \nFRESH MARKET FIELDS \nPlants up to 10\":  Average of 0.75 adults/plant, or defoliation \u226510% \n \nPlants 10\" to early fruit set:  If using Bt's: \n \u22655% of plants infested with egg masses, and \u226530% of egg \n masses have hatched. \n \n If using conventional insecticides: \n Average of 1 adult or larva/plant, or defoliation \u226510% \n  44 Early Fruit set to fruit maturity:  \u226510% defoliation or \u22652% plants with at least one freshly \n injured fruit  \n \n3. Flea Beetles: \n \nScout for flea beetle feeding damage during the firs t two weeks after transplant.  If plants seem \nstressed by feeding, recommend treatment. \n \n4. Aphids:  \nPotato aphid is a vector for some tomato viru ses.  Their importance early in the season is \nquestionable, and therefore no treatment threshold has  been developed in New York.  However, it will be \nuseful to collect information on the level of aphid infestation.    \n Sample one lower and one middle compound leaf per plant. \n  Report the average number of aphids per leaf. \n \n A threshold of 8 aphids per leaf  is being used in Massachusetts. \n 5. Insects that may come with transplants: \n \nDuring the first scouting trip of the season, in spect transplants for any insects that may have \ndeveloped in the greenhouse.  Report any finding of t hem on the scouting report form.  The following \ninsects could possibly be imported with transplants:  leafminers, tomato pinworm, melon aphid, green \npeach aphid, whiteflies. \n   6. Other Insects: \n \nOther insect pests which may be observed on to matoes are tarnished plant bug (TPB), stink bug, \ntomato hornworm, leafhoppers and tomato fruitworm (corn earworm, late August/early September).  \nBrush/shake foliage to detect pres ence of stink bug and TPB.  During dry seasons stink bug and TPB can \ncause fruit damage, especially if to matoes are grown close to other host plants such as strawberries, \nbrambles, or alfalfa (especially right after cutting) .  Record presence or damage while scouting for other \npests. Consider treatment if stink bug or  TPB are easily found in a field.    \nPay attention to reports of corn earworm from nearby sweet corn fields.  If damage or trap catches \nare reported, then pay particular attention to the po ssible presence of this pes t in tomato fields.  \nIf tomato spotted wilt virus is found in the field it may be important to monitor for thrips, which vector \nthe virus from plant to plant.  \n  45 7. Early Blight \n Refer to Cornell Fact Sheet 725.60 \n(http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell. edu/factsheets/Potato_EarlyBlt.htm\n) for a brief description of this \ndisease (also infects potato). \nScouting:  \nRecord disease severity for each of five 30 ft. sect ions of row, distributed throughout the field, using \nthe rating system below.  This information is to help us evaluate and refine TOM-CAST and should be \ndone relatively quickly.  Ratings going into categor y 4 would be reason for concern about potential yield \nloss.  Consult with the area IPM educat or if this is the case.  Pay par ticular attention to early maturing \nvarieties (Pilgrim, Vendor, New Yorker, etc.) since they are more susceptible to early blight.  Early blight \nlesions are generally found first on the lower mature leaves.  \n \n Severity Class Range of Disease Percentages \n  1 no disease present \n 2 1-10 % foliage affected \n 3 11-30 % foliage affected  4 31-70 % foliage affected \n 5 71-90 % foliage affected \n 6 91-100 % foliage affected  \nEarly Blight Forecasting:   \n The TOM-CAST system will be used to schedule pr otectant fungicide sprays for controlling early \nblight.  Daily data on temperature and hours of l eaf wetness will be needed to determine DSV's (daily \nseverity values) using the table below.  Begin reco rding DSV's as soon as tomatoes are transplanted.  \nThe first fungicide application should occur when 25 DSV's  have accumulated since transplanting.  If 25 \nDSV\u2019s have not accumulated before July 11, apply the first fungicide at that time*.  Subsequent \napplications should occur when 18-22 DSV's  have accumulated since the prev ious application if Bravo or \nQuadris are used, or 15 DSV\u2019s  if mancozeb fungicides are used.  If spray intervals extend more than 14 \ndays using TOM-CAST, and the weather forecast calls for rain, apply a fungicide and allow it time to dry \nbefore the onset of rain.   \n \n*The July 11 date may not make sense for very late  transplanted fields.  Use your best judgement to \ndetermine the best time for the first fungicide applicati on if DSV\u2019s are accumulating very slowly.  Rapidly \nenlarging fruit or any early blight symptoms would be reasons to initiate the first fungicide application . \n \nCAUTION:   Where bacterial canker is a perennial probl em, do not attempt to use TOM-CAST to schedule \nfungicide applications.  The spray intervals reco mmended by TOM-CAST are not sufficient to manage \nbacterial canker.  See the section on bacterial  diseases for additional management information. \n   Leaf wetness periods (hr.) required to produce \n Daily Disease Severity Values of:                 \nMean Temp. \n(\u00b0F) (during wetting period)  0 1 2 3 4   \n55-63 0-6 7-15 16-20 21+ 64-68 0-3 4-8 9-15 16-22 23+ \n69-77 0-2 3-5 6-12 13-20 21+ \n78-84 0-3 4-8 9-15 16-22 23+ \n \nMadden, L., S.P. Pennypacker, and A.A. MacNab.  Phytopathology 68:1354-1358 \n  46 Guidelines for determining length of wetting periods:  \n \n2 or more hours that do not register leaf wetness are required to end a wetting period. \n Never break a wetting period at an arbitrary time point.  For example, if a wetting period starts at 10 PM \nand continues until 8 AM the following day, you have one 10-hour wetting period, not 2 hours for the first \nday and 8 hours for the second.  \n \n \n8.  Late Blight \n \nRefer to Cornell Fact Sheet 726.20 \n(http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell. edu/factsheets/Potato_LateBlt.htm\n) for a good description of this \ndisease (also affects potato). \n Keep an eye open for possible late blight symptoms  as you walk between scouting locations.  Late \nblight may first appear in areas of the field with poor  air circulation, such as wooded edges or low areas.  \nInspect stems, green and red fruit, and growing points at t he top of plants carefully.   If the humidity is not \nhigh enough for sporulation when the field is scouted, suspect lesions may be held in moist chambers and \nchecked for sporulation after 12-24 hours.  Scouts:  if late blight is found, highlight the report on the \nscouting form and indicate that immediate action is needed.  \nMonitor late blight incidence in potatoes via the late  blight network listserv.  (Contact local Extension \nor Area IPM Specialist for information about access).  If late blight infected potato or tomato fields are \nreported in your county or adjacent c ounties, switch to a late blight forecast for fungicide scheduling:   \n \n0-2 SV over previous 7 days: Use TOM-CAST recommended intervals \n3-5 SV over previous 7 days: 7 day spray interval 6+ SV over previous 7 days: 5 day spray interval \n \nIf rain is forecast and 7 or more days have pa ssed since the last fungicide application, apply a \nfungicide before the leaves get wet if possible. If late b light is found in the field, destroy infected plants if \nthe infection is localized, and maintain a 5-day f ungicide schedule.  Disk down plants as soon as harvest \nis complete or if the field is abandoned because of late blight infection. \n \nIf late blight is found in the field, collect a samp le and send it to the Cornell disease diagnostic lab for \nisolate identification.  The US 7 11, and 17 isolates are more aggressi ve on tomato than other isolates, \nand will require especially close adherence to the spray intervals recommended above.  To send a \nsample for diagnosis, place one infected compound leaf in a plastic bag and blow air into the bag to inflate it before sealing it.  It\u2019s best to place each leaf into a separate bag.  Box and ship via overnight \nservice to:  Karen Snover-Clif, Plant Disease Di agnostic Lab, 329 Plant Science, Ithaca, NY 14853.  \nInclude your name and phone number, the name of t he grower, and location of the field.   NOTE:  Late \nblight diagnosis is no longer free but is essential!  \n \n9. Anthracnose \n See the fact sheet 735.70 ( http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell. edu/factsheets/Tomato_Anth.htm\n) for a \npicture of an anthracnose lesion on tomato fruit. \n \nScheduling fungicide applications according to TO MCAST should provide good anthracnose control. \n \nAnthracnose will only be monitored on fruit.  It is most se vere in red fruit in the first cluster (the cluster \nclosest to the ground) and most often tends to be found on the surface facing the ground.  Anthracnose \nwill not be observed in the field if tomatoes are picked before they are red in color.  Anthracnose \nsymptoms are generally not randomly scattered throughout a tomato field.  Looking in certain moist areas \nof the field such as low spots, shady spots or areas  next to woods will enable the scout to more efficiently  47 find the disease if it is present in the field.  Theref ore at least 1-2 of the sites that are chosen for sampling \npests in tomatoes should be in low spots or areas bor dering woods if tomatoes are ripened in the field.  \nOn each plant sampled, look on the underside of the fi rst fruit cluster for sunken, circular lesions.  \nThere is no need to count the lesions on individual frui t.  Report the percent plants with one or more fruit \nwith any lesion(s) on the scouting report form. \n \n10.   Buckeye Rot: \n \n See Fact Sheet 736.20 \n(http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu /factsheets/Cucurb it_Phytoph.htm ) for a description of \nPhythophthora blight of tomato and other crops. \n \nOnly fruit are affected.  It is more likely to occur on fruit near the ground and on plants in disease-\nprone areas (fields with a history of the pathogen (Phytophthora) on tomato, pepper, cucurbits, eggplant; \nlow areas; plants grown on the ground or without mulc h).  Look at fruit near the ground on plants in low \nareas for firm, smooth, brown spots.  Lesions can co ver entire fruit.  Concentric zones within the lesions \nare characteristic.  Note presence in the comment se ction of the scouting report form.  Collect affected \nfruit for diagnosis confirmation.  In fields with confirmed buckeye rot, recommend Ridomil fungicides. \n 11. Septoria leaf spot \n \n See Fact sheet 735.80 \n(http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell. edu/factsheets/Tomato_Septoria.htm\n) for descriptions of Septoria \nleaf spot.  \nScheduling fungicides using TOMCAST should provide good control of Septoria leaf spot.  Inspect \nthose leaves sampled for the presence of Septoria le sions on leaves and stems.  Look for the presence of \nsmall dark brown pimple-like structures called pycnidia  on the lesion to aid in distinguishing this disease \nfrom early blight. This disease is most commonly associated with infected transplants although if annual \nrotation is not practiced the organism survives on pl ant debris. The fungus prefers cool, wet springs for \nearly disease spread. Report the pr esence or absence of infected plants on the scouting report form.   \n \n12. Viruses: \n \nFact sheets 735.40 (General viruses) \n(http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell. edu/factsheets/Viruses_Tomato.htm\n) and 735.90 (Tomato spotted \nwilt) ( http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu /factsheets/Virus_SpottedWilt.htm ) describe several virus \ndiseases which may be seen on tomato plants.  Although the scout will not systemat ically sample for any \nof these diseases it is important  to note the presence of virus diseases in the field in the comments \nsection of the scouting report form.  Distinguishing bet ween the diseases in the field may be difficult.  If \nthe problem is widespread it may be necessary to s ubmit a sample for diagnosis to the county agent and \nthe Disease Diagnostic Lab at Cornell.  Tomato spott ed wilt virus (TSWV) is transmitted from plant to \nplant by thrips.  If tomato spotted w ilt is found in the field, monitor fo r thrips by tapping flowers to dislodge \nthe thrips, and if they are present, they may need to  be controlled to avoid further plant to plant \ntransmission. \n \n13. Bacterial diseases: \n \nFact sheet 735.50 ( http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu /factsheets/Tomato_Bacterial.htm ) \ndescribes the important bacterial di seases (bacterial speck, spot, and canker) which occur on tomatoes in \nNew York.  The best management strategy for bacterial diseases is prevention.  Always use disease free \nor hot water treated seed and practice a 2-3 year ro tation away from tomatoes and peppers.  Scan leaves \nand fruit \u22641 1/4 inches in diameter for symptoms of any of the three bacterial diseases.  If found in the \nfield collect a sample for diagnosis.  In fields with confirmed bacterial disease infections, discontinue the \nuse of TOMCAST for scheduling fungicides and reco mmend copper be included in fungicide applications.  \nTo avoid spreading bacterial pathogens, do not scout or  work in infected fields when foliage is wet.   48 For staked fields:  Always disinfect stakes between seasons, and do not re-use string or other \nhardware.  Include copper in fungicide applications  made after staking and pruning operations.  When \npruning, growers can place buckets of disinfectant with towels at regular intervals throughout field and \nhave workers wash off gloves when they r each a bucket, to minimize spread of pathogens. \n \n \n14. Powdery Mildew:  Powdery mildew is a new foliar diseas e with potential to cause extensive \npremature leaf death in non-fungi cide-treated plants.  White powder y fungal growth develops on both \nupper and under leaf surfaces.  Fortunately, contro l has been achieved with Bravo applied following a \nTOM-CAST forecast. \n \n \n14. Other diseases: \n \n Other diseases which are un likely to cause serious problem s but which may be observed in \ntomato fields during the scouting season are Botr ytis (refer to fact sheet 735.60), white mold ( Sclerotinia ), \nand Rhizoctonia .  Severe cases of Botrytis can cause signs (sclerotia) and symptoms (stems turn beige to \nwhite in color) which may mimic white mold (figure 3 in fact sheet 735.60) Note any occurrence of these \ndiseases.  A specific fungicide app lication(s) may be required for Botr ytis control as considerable green \nfruit in a cluster can be lost.  This is especially true during peri ods of frequent summer rains and extended \nperiods of heavy dews.  15. Weeds: \n Making a Weed Map \n \nWeeds or weed species may not be evenly distributed ov er a field.  Where localized areas of severe \ninfestations are found or atypical conditions exis t (poorly drained area, high spots, field edges), weed \ninfestations may be recorded on a weed map. A weed map illustrates problem areas and provides \ninformation for future control decisions.  When weed maps are kept over a period of years for a given \nfield, changes in location and population can be noted and control decisions adjusted accordingly.  Areas \nof severe infestations can be targeted for specific control practices, rather than treating a larger area \nneedlessly or failing to control problems at all. \n \nFirst, make a rough sketch of the field, including landmarks, boundaries, crop row direction, compass \ndirections, roads, planting date, date of map prepar ation, and any other important details.  Then the \nfollowing information should be indicated on the map: \n \nWeed species , or if this is unknown, some effort s hould be made to distinguish annual from perennial, \nand broadleaf species from grasses and from yellow nuts edge.  Make a special effort to identify hard to \ncontrol weeds such as nightshades. \n Abundance  of each species estimated according to the following system: \n 0  =  None; 1  =  Scattered, few weeds;  2  =  Slight, 1 weed/6 row feet;  \n 3  =  Moderate, 1 weed/3 row feet;  4  =  Severe, > 1 weed/3 row feet \n \nDistribution  of weeds in the field is impor tant and can be rated as follows: \n SPOTTY - found in a few places around the field;   LOCAL - found in a small portion of the field;   \n GENERAL - found throughout the field \n Weed size  -  The following size ratings can be used:   \n WHITE SPROUTS  - seeds are ju st germinating or emerging;  \n TINY - weeds show only co tyledons or first true leaf; \n SMALL - weeds less than 1\" tall or less than the diameter of a quarter \n LARGE - weeds more than 1\" tall or more than the diameter of a quarter   49 Throughout the season, at least two weed maps should be prepared.  Timing should be as follows: \n \n 1.  Early - shortly after transplanting.   Purpose:  to evaluate the success of \n               the current season weed control program. \n \n 2.  Late - Near harvest.  Purpose:  to plan for next season's weed control \n               needs.  Weed management in Tomatoes: \n \nHerbicide chemistries for as needed, post emergent w eed control are available for tomatoes grown in \nfields in which the weed populations are primarily  annual broadleaves and grasses.  For annual broadleaf \nweeds, use the low rate application of Sencor (refer to  Cornell Recommends for details) just as weeds are \nemerging.  Up to 3 applications may be necessary, and will be most effective when used in combination \nwith cultivation.  The higher label rate may be us ed if weeds get too big.  If annual grasses are also \npresent, one postemergent application of Poas t should provide sufficient control.   \n \nCornell University Vegetable IPM Program \n2/04  50 EXPERIENCES WITH LATE BLIGHT \nDISEASE OCCURRENCE AND CONTROL 2003 \n \nThomas A. Zitter \n \nProfessor, Department of Plant Pathology \nCornell University \nIthaca, NY 14853 \ntaz1@cornell.edu  \n \nBackground  \n Late blight of tomato and potato caused by Phytophthora infestans  occurred in several states in \nthe Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region during the 2003 seas on.  In potato, late blight was first reported \nfrom western Pennsylvania (Crawford and Erie Cos.) on July 24, from Maine, New Jersey, and Maryland \nin mid-August, and in three counties in western New Yo rk in late August.  The isolates from NY were \nidentified as the predominant potat o genotype in the US, US-8 (mating type 2), which is metalaxyl \nresistant (Table 1). \nIn tomato, late blight was first found in comme rcial fields in Lancaster Co. Pennsylvania and in \nprocessing tomato fields in Cumberland Co. New Jersey in early August.  Subsequent spread in NJ \noccurred in both commercial fresh market tomatoes  and home garden locations from late August and into \nSeptember.  The tomato isolates from Cumberl and Co. were assigned to an unknown lineage with an A2 \nmating type (Table 1).  From all accounts, the tomato la te blight isolates were more aggressive on tomato \nthan the US-8 isolates were on potato.  Table 1.  Recent clonal lineages of Phytophthora infestans detected in the United States and Canada.  \n(US-1, US-6, US-7, and US-8 have been locally pr edominant, and US-8 has been nationally predominant \nsince 1995 for potato; for tomato, US-7, US-11,  US-17, and unknown lineages predominate).

Some isolat es are primarily pathogens of potatoes (P), and others are \npathogens of both potatoes and to matoes (P-T).  The US-1 clonal lineage contained a few individuals that were \npathogenic on both potatoes and to matoes, but most were pathogenic mainly on potatoes.  4 Dates refers to the time \nduring when these lineages were common.  The US-1 cl onal lineage seems rare since 1993.  The US-6 lineage has \ndeclined in  frequency since 1993.  Lineages US \u201312, 13 and 14 are not  included in the table as they appeared in only \n1 field in 1994. 51 History  \nSince the early 1980s late blight has becom e an increasing problem for potato and tomato \ngrowers around the globe.  New and aggressive strains that originated in Mexico have displaced the \nprevious indigenous strains.  Thes e exotic strains were first detec ted in Europe, but have subsequently \nbeen found around the world, including the US.  Severa l independent migrations have occurred such that \nthe migrant populations in North America are currently ve ry different from those in  Europe.  In fact, the \npopulations that exist in Western Europe are so diverse and aggressive, that the populations can be \nviewed almost as a \u201csecond center of origin\u201d after c entral Mexico, and represents a major crisis in many \nof these countries.  The exotic stra ins that occur in the US also came from Mexico, but from a different \nlocation and contain some different characteristics.  The exotic strains that were introduced into the US \nwere primarily of single genotypes , so that the structure of P. infestans  populations in the US remains \nvery simple, with only a few genotypes with widespread distribution (ie. US-7, US-8, etc., see Table 1).  \nAs in Europe, these exotic strains have displac ed the previous indigenous strains (US-1, US-6). \n Why did the exotic strains displace the previous  indigenous strains and what is the significance of \nthe potential for sexual recombination?  P. infestans has two mating types, A1 and A2, which can lead to \nsexual recombination and the production of oospores.  This provides a mechanism for eliminating \ndeleterious mutations that can accumulate in an asexual lineage.  The previous indigenous strains like \nUS-1 are thought to have been asexual for 150 years.  Sexual reproduction provides the mechanism for \nproducing particularly fit genotypes, and this may include providing resistance to some fungicides such as \nmetalaxyl and mefenoxam, Ridomil and Ridomil Gold, respectively.  New strains may also require \nsignificantly more fungicide (up to 25% more) for adequate suppression of late blight.  Furthermore, the \nability of P. infestans  to produce the sexual spore form (oospor e) would provide a mechanism for this \norganism to overwinter in the absence of the host.  Sporangia produced by asexual reproduction may \nsurvive in the soil fro days or weeks while oospores  produced by sexual reproduction may survive n the \nsoil for months or years.  There is circumstant ial evidence that US-11 lineage found on tomato and potato \nin New York was generated by sexual reproduction in western United States.  The long distance \nmovement of sporangia on weather fronts is thought to  be 10 to 50 miles, but the former Russian KGB, \nwhen studying the use of late blight as a biologi cal agent, felt they could spread the pathogen over 1000 \nkm (600 miles). \n The occurrence of new exotic and more virulent strains of P. infestans  has also forced plant \npathologists to reexamine the biology of this organism.  The host range has been extended to include \nhairy nightshade ( Solanum sarachioides ), garden petunia ( Petunia  hybrida ), and bittersweet ( S. \ndulcamara ).  The spread of late blight from petuni a to tomato transplants is a real threat. \nFungicidal control  \n Fortunately our situation in North America is not as bleak as in Holland where the potato crop \nmay require as many as 22 applicati ons, with applications beginning as ear ly as April.  Other than late \nblight resistance for metalaxyl and mefenoxam, there are no fungicide resistance concerns with products \ncurrently used to control late blight , but most products are tank mix ed with protectant fungicides and \nmaterials with different modes of action are alte rnated.  In the case of early blight control  in potato \n(Alternaria solani ) and in tomato ( A. tomatophila ), there is reduced sensitiv ity to azoxystrobin (Quadris) \ndue to a mutation at the F129L location in the cytoch rome b protein sequence.  This reduced sensitivity \nshould also apply to the other members of the Gr oup 11 fungicides, such as other strobilurins like \nHeadline and Gem, or the newer QoI fungicides with  the same mode of action, Tanos and Reason.  \nConsequently, growers using the Group 11 fungicides for early blight control should rotate the use of \nthese products with multi-site fungicides like chlo rothalonil or mancozeb or use a premix of these \nfungicides (Quadris Opti is a mixtur e of azoxystrobin and chlorothalonil).  Growers should limit the use of \nGroup 11 fungicides to 1/3 of their total spray program. \nTomato Fungicide Trial : A fungicide trial was at conducted at Freeville, NY in 2003 using the variety \n\u2018Supersonic\u2019 (Table 2).  Disease spreader ro ws were inoculated with early blight ( Alternaria tomatophila \n(light phenotype)) on 25 July, and with late blight ( Phytophthora infestans  US-17) on 15 August.  Heavy \ndisease pressure occurred for both diseases , encouraged by frequent rains and supplemented with \noverhead irrigation.  Fungicides were applied with a CO 2 pressurized boom sprayer at 60 psi, delivering \n28.8 gal/A through four TeeJet XR11003 flat fan nozzl es spaced 20 in. apart.  Sprays were applied on a \n7-day schedule (A = 25 Jul, B = 30 Jul, C = 6 Aug, D = 13 Aug, E = 20, F = 27 Aug, G = 5 Sep, and H = \n10 Sep).  Fungicides specific for late blight in addi tion to the regular products (Bravo, Quadris, Amistar,  52 Quadris Opti, and Cabrio) included Ranman (c yaxofamid), Reason (fenamidone), and Tanos \n(famoxadone + cymoxanil).  The initial sprays (A, B, and C) were used for early blight control, while \nsprays scheduled for D-H were used to control both early blight and late blight.  The late blight specific \nmaterials were applied for the first time on August 13,  two days before late blight was introduced into the \nspreader rows . \n All fungicide treatments provided good to excellent control of early blight.  For example, the \ncontrol showed 50-75% defoliation compared to treatment  8 which included Quadris Opti with a rating of \n3% infection.  Similarly, all fungicide treatments provided good control on tomato foliage for late blight, \nand all were significantly better than the control.  As  is typical of the new ex otic strains, US-17 was \nparticular severe for tomato fruit infection.  Ther e were no significant differences among the better late \nblight materials tests, with exceptional contro l achieved with Ranman, Reason, and Tanos used in \nalternation with protectant fungicides.  Bravo, when used preventatively for late blight control, also \nperformed well.  Treatment 15, consisting of Phos trol used alone and mixed with Dithane, provided good \nfoliar control for late blight, but provided less contro l later in the season, as indicated by the higher \nnumber of fruit infections.  Providi ng only two weekly sprays over a cr itical 12-day period did not provide \nthe level of protection achieved by the other systemic materials.  Du ring periods of intensive disease \npressure, Phostrol mixed with a protectant (bot h at the highest rates) and on a 5-day schedule would \nhave provided better control. \nReferences  \nFry, W.

Zitter \nProfessor, Department of Plant Pathology \nCornell University \nIthaca, NY 14853 \n \n A large number of fungicides are currently labeled fo r use on potato as seed pi ece, in-furrow or foliar \napplications for disease control.  Becau se of the growing concern about the development of fungicide resistance, the \nFungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) has grouped fungicides according to their mode of actions and \nresistance risk.  The seed  piece and in-furrow fungici de treatments available fo r potato are summarized in Table 1 .  \nSelecting which fungicide to use will depend upon the end use of the product (fresh market vs. processing), and \nwhich diseases are viewed as most important that need to  be controlled.  The three pathogens that contribute the \nmost to surface blemish problems that could directly  affect fresh market sa les based upon appearance are \nRhizoctonia black scurf ( Rhizoctonia solani ), silver scurf ( Helminthosporium solani ), and black dot ( Colletotrichum  \ncoccodes ).  Scab ( Streptomyces  scabies ) is also a serious problem, but cont rol is usually achieved by varietal \nselection and soil management practices , with only minimal reliance on seed piece treatments.  Rhizoctonia black \nscurf and stem canker is fairly easily  controlled now that we have many hi ghly specific products (Moncut, Moncoat \nMZ, Tops MZ, and T-22) as well as some more broad ba sed ones (Maxim MZ seed pi ece and Quadris (Amistar) in-\nfurrow application).  The latter two materials also provide ex cellent control of seed borne silver scurf and black dot, \nalthough soil borne inoculum for black dot plays the most important role in providing inoculum. \nFungicide resistance  concerns is generally low for the fungicide s used in this manner, with a moderate \nconcern for Tops MZ resistance for the silver scurf fungus.  As a precaution on the use of Quadris or Amistar used \nas an in-furrow spray, the first foliar application to be made to potato should be with a non-Group 11 fungicide \n(products other than Quadris, Amistar or Quadris Opti; othe r strobilurins like Gem or Headline; other products with \na similar mode of action like Reason and Tanos).  Resist ance concerns also exist for the use of mefenoxam for \nPythium leak and Phytophthora pink rot control and for thiabe ndazole use on stored tubers (see Table 1).  In the case \nof pink rot, Phostrol applied in furrow in a mixture with chlorothalonil helped to reduce pink rot in studies conducted in North Dakota.  Foliar appli cations of Phostrol mixed with chlorothalonil did not appear to provide \nadditional reduction of pink rot. \n Specific foliar fungicides for use on potato and re sistance management concerns are addressed in Table 2 .  \nFungicides on the first page include 8 fungicides that have a multi-site mode of action, and include the standards for \na protectant fungicide program.  Not only are they good on thei r own, but also they are particularly important when \nused as mixing partners or as alte rnation products when more disease specific products are used.  The most \nimmediate concern for fungicide resistance\n occurs with the strobilurin fungicide Quadris.  Reduced sensitivity to \nazoxystrobin has been found and its immediate impact is for early blight control ( Alternaria solani ).  This resistance \nhas occurred in Wisconsin and Nebraska.  Besides Quadris and other soon to be released  products (Quadris Opti and \nAmistar), this concern would also extend to products w ith a similar mode of action (Group 11 materials including \nGem, Headline, Reason and Tanos). 55 Table 1.

Zitter \nProfessor, Department of Plant Pathology \nCornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853 \n \n \nPlant diseases can be a limiting factor in pepper production wherever the crop is grown.  Moisture in the \nform of wind blown rain, saturated soils and high humidity pl ays a major role in the occu rrence of both bacterial and \nfungal diseases.  Insects that attack pepper serve to create wounds favorable for bacterial soft rot and spread several \nvirus diseases.  Clean seed, greenhouse sanitation, crop ro tation, and cultural measures in the field are all key \ncomponents for disease control, but it all starts with the seed!  This is especially true for the first disease discussed, \nbacterial leaf spot.  All major seed co mpanies are incorporating disease resistan ce into most released varieties with \nemphasis placed on bacterial leaf spot, Phytopht hora blight, and assorted virus diseases. \n \nBacteria  \nBacterial Leaf Spot (BLS)  \nBacterial leaf spot is caused by two major groups of bacteria, Xanthomonas campestris  pv. vesicatoria  and \nXanthomonas vesicatoria (some literature will also mention Xanthomonas  axonopodis  pv. vesicatoria ).  A number of \nraces occur for each of these pathogens , with some occurring more commonly on pepper and others on tomato.  Both \nbacteria are gram-negative rods, have a single polar flagellum used for mobility, and are found only in association with \nplants or plant materials.  The BLS pathogens are seedborne, both within the seed and on the seed surface .  BLS may \nalso survive on plant debris in the soil for 1-2 years, theref ore a 2-year rotation out of pepper and tomato is essential. \nSeed can be treated  with hot water  (122\u00b0F for 25 minutes) or with Clorox\u00ae  (EPA Reg. No. 5813-1; label \navailable from Clorox at 800-446-4686).  Hot water is more e ffective for controlling bacteria on and within seed, but \nhot water can adversely affect germination if not properly performed (see ref. 3).  Treating the seed yourself nullifies \nthe seed company\u2019s liability and voids their guarantees.  Mi x 1 quart of Clorox\u00ae bleach (calcium hypochlorite) with 4 \nquarts of water to treat up to 1 pound of seed in a cheeseclot h bag, add \u00bd tsp. of surfactant (dishwashing detergent), \nand submerge in the solution with agitation for 40 minutes , rinse under running tap water for 5 min, and dry seed \nthoroughly.  Treated seed should be dusted with Thiram 75W  [dithiocarbamate] (1 tsp. per pound of seed), and planted \nsoon after treatment. \nSome varieties currently have resist ance to all three races of BLS (BLSR1 , 2, 3) that comm only occur in our \narea.  These include Boynton Bell, Aristotle, Commandant, Enterprise, Revolution, X3R Camelot, and X3R Wizard.  \nKing Arthur is resistant to race 2 and Ad miral is resistant to races 1 and 2.  Resistance to races 1 and 3 are most \nimportant for the Northeast. \nUse of disease-free seed and a 2-year rotation in the field should solve most of the BLS problems, but some \npersistent cases may require chemical treatments.  Streptomycin (Agri-Mycin 17, Agri-Strep) sprays (1 lb per 100 gallons or 1 \u00bc tsp per gallon) may be app lied to transplants prior to transplanti ng.  In the field, applying fixed copper \n(1 lb active ingredient per acre) plus maneb (1 \u00bd lb 80W P per acre) has been shown to  reduce the spread of BLS. \n \nBacterial Soft Rot (BSR)\n \n Bacterial soft rot is caused primarily by Erwinia  carotovora  subsp. carotovora .  The bacterium is \ncommonly associated with plan ts, soils and surface water, and thus is a common contaminant.  BSR is primarily a \npost-harvest problem except when fruit are injured in the fi eld by insect feeding.  The European corn borer larvae \ntunnel under the calyx (cap), and their entry holes are mark ed by sawdust-like frass.  Insecticide treatments should \ncoincide with peaks in adult activity as determined by phero mone or light traps.  Registered insecticides include \ncyfluthrin (Baythroid 2), esfenvalerate (Asana XL), perm ethrin (Ambush), and spinosad (SpinTor 2SC).  Hot pepper \nvarieties are most resistant to larval feeding, while green be ll peppers are most susceptible. \n Post-harvest wash water can spread the bacterium fr om contaminated to healt hy fruit, therefore most \npeppers are packed dry to minimize BSR.  If wash water is used, maintaining 25 ppm chlorine in the wash water (1 \nTBS of Clorox\u00ae, 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, per 8 gallons of water).  Make sure that the wash water is not cooler \nthan the fruit temperature, or bacteria will move into the fruit or stem end. \n  62 Oomycetes  \nPythium Damping Off  (also caused by Phytophthora  spp., and Rhizoctonia solani ) \n Growing media can be a source of various soil-borne f ungi, so care must be exercised in selection of the \nappropriate media and attenti on paid to characteristics that will allow the growing media to remain moist but not \ncontinually wet.  Addition of soil amendments that c ontribute to suppression of soil-borne pathogens can be \nconsidered.  SoilGard 12G, containing the naturally occurring fungus Gliocladium  virens  is known to be \nantagonistic to fungi such as Pythium  and Rhizoctonia , two of the more common fungi responsible for damping off. \n \nPythium Root Rot  \n Pythium root rot generally occurs after peppers ar e transplanted in polyethylene mulch/drip irrigation \nculture.  Cultural practices that contribute to Pythium root rot are planting in low areas of  the field, overwatering in \nan attempt to reduce wilting, and planting into beds with  fresh plant material (cover crop, weeds, etc.) before \nmicrobial breakdown of the plant material has occurred.  Th e infected roots of infected plants will appear brown \nrather than white, and the cortical tissue of the main a ffected roots can easily be re moved from the central steele \nwith a finger nail.  After removing transplants from th e greenhouse and prior to transplanting, plants can be \ndrenched with the systemic fungicide mefenoxam  ( Group 4  fungicide) (Ridomil Gold 4E or Ultra Flourish 2E).  \nApply Ridomil 4E at 0.75 fl.oz. /2,000 ft2/100 gallons of water or Ultra Flourish 2E at 1.5 fl.oz. /200ft2/100 gallons \nof water. \n \nPhytophthora Crown Rot and Aerial Blight  \n Phytophthora blight can be one of the most serious di seases affecting pepper as well as eggplants, tomatoes, \nand the entire cucurbit family.  Because  it affects such a wide range of ve getables, growers are challenged to \ndevelop adequate rotational st rategies.  Consequently, control must depe nd upon cultural, chemical and selection of \nresistant varieties when available.  Phytopht hora blight is caused by the soil borne oomycete Phytophthora capsici .  \nThe disease can be divided into two distinct phases, a crown rot phase  and an aerial blight phase . \n In the crown rot phase  of the disease, a black girdling lesion occu rs at the soil line.  In some plants the \nlower tissue of the wilted plants must be removed to e xpose the girdling lesion in the cortical tissue beneath the \nepidermis.  Most cases of the crown rot phase occur in July  and August in the lower areas of the field and from there \nthe disease can spread to adjoining areas  of the field.  Phytophthora is consid ered a weather event disease, meaning \nthat heavy rainfall (in excess of 2 inches) leading to saturate d soils is critical for infections to occur.  Generally soil \ntemperatures are > 65\u00b0F and air temper atures are in the range of 75-85\u00b0F. \n The aerial phase  of Phytophthora blight occurs later in the season as the spores produced on the lesions of \nplants infected in the crown rot phase  are spread by heavy, wind driven rain s.  These typically  occur following a \ntropical storm or hurricane, another major weather event.  In fection occurs at the axil of a branch and stem with a 2-\n3 inch black, girdling lesion developing on the stem.  All of  the leaves on the branch above the lesion will wilt and \neventually the entire plant dies. \n Cultural control measures  aim to mitigate the affects of the w eather events mentioned above.  Avoid \nplanting in low-lying areas  of the field that are prone to standing water following rain events.  Raised and dome \nshaped beds without depressions  in the top will allow for speedy movement of moisture away from the crown region \nof the plants.  Provide drainage  at the end of the field to allow excess water to flow out of the fields.  When crown \nrot infected plants o ccur in the field, re move infected plants  to avoid production of spores leading to the aerial phase \nof the disease. \n Chemical control measures  may be necessary to augment the cultura l practices mentioned above.  This is \nespecially true in fields with a history of Phytophthora blight and that are likely to experience saturated soils \nfollowing heavy rains.  The fungicide mefenoxam ( Group 4  fungicide) (Ridomil Gold 4E, Ultra Flourish 2E) can be \napplied as a banded spray over the row shortly after transp lanting or it can be injected through the drip irrigation \nsystem to protect against the crown rot phase of the di sease.  Mefenoxam needs to be reapplied twice at 30-day \nintervals after the transplant application.  Two week s after the last applicati on of mefenoxam, begin foliar \napplications of a fixed copper fungicide with a spreader s ticker to provide protection ag ainst the foliar phase of the \ndisease.  Tanos (a mixture of famoxadone [ Group 11 ] and cymoxanil [ Group 27 ]) is also labeled for peppers.  For \nbest results tank mix Tanos with a c opper fungicide, and for resistance management do not make more than one \napplication of this mixture before alternating w ith a fungicide with a different mode of action. \n Resistant varieties  are being developed to reduce the incidence of Phytophthora blight in pepper.  \nResistance genes are required for both the crown rot and aeria l phases of the disease, and these must be bred into \ncommercially acceptable varieties.  The varieties \u2018Emerald Isle\u2019 and \u2018Reinge r\u2019 possess resistance to the crown rot \nphase of Phytophthora, but do not possess sufficient horticultural ch aracteristics to be commercially acceptable.  The  63 variety \u2018Paladin has excellent resistance to the crown rot phase of Phytophthora but does not provide sufficient \nresistance toward the aerial phase.  Th e variety \u2018Aristotle\u2019 provides only tolerance to the crown rot phase and like \n\u2018Paladin\u2019 has insuffici ent resistance for the aerial pha se.  Both \u2018Paladin\u2019 and \u2018Aristotle\u2019 do have excellent \nhorticultural character istics similar to the variety \u2018Cam elot\u2019.  One occasiona l flaw in both \u2018Palad in\u2019 and \u2018Aristotle\u2019, \nand possibly related to Phytophthora resistance, is the devel opment of a \u201csilvering\u2019 pattern on the fruit.  \u2018Paladin\u2019 \nalso develops fine shoulder cracks when allowed to mature  to the red stage, and is therefore not recommended for \nthe red fruit market.  Additional Phytophthora tolerant hybrids include \u2018Conquest\u2019 and \u2018Revolution\u2019. \nFungi  \nWhite Mold  \n White mold is caused by the soil borne fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum .  Many vegetable crops are \nsusceptible to this fungus, although corn and grasses are not.  Leading susceptible crops include tomato, cabbage, \nlettuce, carrot, celery, snap bean, several cucurbits, a nd of course pepper.  The pathogen produces hard, black \nsclerotia, like small, flattened and el ongated raisins which serve as the overwintering means for the fungus.  These \nsclerotia, which can survive in the soil for years, may be produced inside of the stems or on the surface of affected \nareas.  Sclerotia germinate at an  optimal temperature of 52\u00b0F; Sclerotinia  is a low-temperature fungus, able to cause \ninfection from 32-82\u00b0F.  The fungus also requires abundant moisture for a week or longer for infection to occur.  \nSclerotia germinate to produce slender stalks that end in  an apothecia (cup- shaped structure in  which asci and \nascospores are produced) or they may germinate by mycelium in some Sclerotia  species.  Although ascospores are \nshort lived, they are blown within a field, landing on senes cent or injured susceptible tissue and penetrate directly.  \nIn pepper, infections occur on stems or in the axil of branches.  Pepper growers in western NY lost 5% of their peppe r crop due to white mold infections during the cool \nand wet growing conditions for summer 2003.  Rotation out of pepper and not using other susceptible crops in \nrotational scheduling will be critical fo r next season and into the foreseeable  future.  Mycoparasites are known to \ndestroy existing sclerotia and inhib it the development of new sclerotia.  The commercial product Contans WG \n(Coniothyrium minitans , EPA Reg. No. 7244-1, and OMRI listed) has shown great promise in significantly reducing \nsclerotial populations.  The product needs to  be applied to the soil prior to planting (1-4 lb/A), and once applied, \nincorporated into the top 2 inches.  If incorporation will be  greater than 2 inches, then the application rate should be \nincreased to 2-6 lb/A.  \nAnthracnose  \n Anthracnose, also known as ripe fruit disease, is potentially caused by three species of the fungus \nColletotrichum : C. coccodes , C. capsici , and C. gloeosporioides .  Although most commonly seen on maturing hot \nand sweet peppers, under appropriate cond itions infections can occur on immature  fruit, stems, and even leaves.  \nInfections appear as sunken lesions on the fruit.  The lesions may turn black with the formation of setae and \nsclerotia, or the center of the lesion may develop pustule s (acervuli) that contain a salmon-colored spore mass.  \nColletotrichum  typically produces microsclerotia that allows the f ungus to overwinter in the soil.  Microsclerotia can \nsurvive for many years, but even a 2 or 3-year rota tion out of susceptible crops (mainly solanaceous) can \nsignificantly reduce inoculum.  For late maturing red peppers the following fungicides are registered: maneb ( Group  M3), 7DTH; Quadris \nand Cabrio (both Group 11  fungicides), 0DTH. \n \nViruses  \nCucumber Mosaic Virus  (cucumovirus, aphid transmitted, not seed  transmitted in pepper, many weed hosts) \n Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is th e most common virus infecting peppers in the Northeast.  The virus can \ninfect more than 800 plant species worldwide.  CMV is readily transmitted from perennial weeds by aphids in a \nnonpersistent method.  It is often the earliest virus transm itted in the spring.  Important weed hosts include common \nmilkweed (Perennial), common chickweed (Winter Annual, but  can become perennialized in cool moist areas, also \nCMV is seedborne in this species), marsh yellow cress (A, Biennial, short-lived P), and yellow rocket (Win A, Bie) \nand more (3, a more complete list is provided).  As aphid populations develop on pe ppers during the spring and \nsummer, extensive spread may occur.  Pepper plants on the edge  of fields and rows are frequently the first plants to \nbe infected. \n Destroy important weeds before the crop is establishe d in the field.  Intercropping with corn or other \nnonsusceptible tall barrier crops have been used keep vi rus from invading the crop.  Rouging infected plants \nespecially from the ends of rows before secondary spr ead occurs may be helpful.  Because of the nonpersistent  64 manner of transmission, control of aphids to prevent spr ead within the crop is not an option.  Inheritance of \nresistance to CMV is very complex, so it is doubtful there are of any truly CMV-resistant peppers. \n \nTobacco Mosaic Virus  (tobamovirus, mechanical transmission, seed transmitted, solanaceous weed hosts) \n TMV is worldwide in distribution and can readily be transmitted by physical contact.  No insect vectors are \nknown.  TMV is one of the most stable plant viruses, capab le of surviving on dried plant debris and roots of tomato \nand probably pepper for many years.  It is known to be seedborne in pepper and toma to.  Although the natural host \nrange of TMV is wide, it is primarily a problem  for solanaceous crops (pepper and tomato). \n \n Sanitation is important for the control of TMV.  This  is particularly true in greenhouse settings where the \nvirus has been diagnosed previously.  Dispose of all plan t material including roots.  Sanitize all flats and bench \nsurfaces with a strong disinfectant pr ior to establishing a new crop and ma ke sure the greenhouse and surrounding \nareas are free of weeds that may har bor the virus.  Some key perennial weed species include marsh yellowcress \n(Rorippa islandica ), broadleaf plantain ( Plantago major ), horsenettle ( Solanum carolinense ), and smooth ( Physalis \nsubglabrata ) and clammy groundcherry ( P. heterophylla ), to name a few (3).  Because TMV is seedborne in pepper \nand other solanaceous crops, make sure to purchase disease-fr ee seed from a reputable seed company.  If seed is of \nquestionable quality, the seed should be soaked for 30 minutes in a 10% solution of household bleach or  for 15 \nminutes in a 10% solution of trisodium phosphate (Na 3P04), often used to soften dried paint brushes.  Either of these \ntreatments will remove most virus from the surface, unless the virus is in the seed endosperm.  Recently released \nvarieties have moderate to high tolerance to some strains of TMV. \n Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus\n (tospovirus, thrips transmission, not seed transmitted, many weed hosts) \nTomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) causes brown spotti ng or dark ringspots on foliage and fruit, and \nstunting and distortion of the young growth of pepper plants.  TSWV is transmitted by at least 8 species of \nthrips, with the tobacco thrips ( Frankliniella fusca ) and western flower thrips ( F. occidentalis ) considered to be the \nmost important vectors.  Thrips acquire TSWV by feeding on infected plants only as larvae.  After a latent \nperiod of 3-7 days, they are then able to transmit the virus to uninfected plants for the remainder of their lives.  \nTSWV has a host range in excess of 600 plant species,  but many of these plants do not support thrips \nreproduction and are considered \u201cdead ends\u201d for virus spread. \nA recent survey of the role of weed hosts for TSWV and the tobacco thrips in North Caroline \nconcluded that key weeds included mouseear (P) and common chickweed (Win A, but can become \nperennialized in cool, moist areas), spiny sowthistle (A),  dandelion (P), blackseed plantain (P), and a buttercup \nspecies (A) (3).  Sanitation around greenhouses is e ssential as well as growing vegetable transplants in a \ngreenhouse separate from ornamentals that commonly serve as  reservoirs.  There is no cure for infected plants, \nwhich should be removed from the greenhouse or the fiel d as soon as they are detected.  SpinTor (spinosad) \nhas been one of the most effective controls for thrips on labeled crops (such as tomatoes and peppers) and \napplications on peppers for European  corn borer will also provide incide ntal control of thrips present. \n \nReferences  \n1.

Maeso \nSecci\u00f3n Protecci\u00f3n Vegetal \nINIA Las Brujas \ndmaeso@inia.org.uy \n \n \n \n La \"peste negra\" del tomate es una de las enfermedades  m\u00e1s importantes de ese cultivo en nuestro pa\u00eds.   Se \nla conoce desde 1915 atacando por pr imera vez en Australia.  En un principio se la encontraba solamente en pa\u00edses \nde la zona templada-subtropi cal del hemisferio sur (Australia, Argentina,  Uruguay, sur de Brasil, Sud\u00e1frica) pero \nactualmente ataca en casi todos los pa\u00edses donde se plantan cultivos susceptibles.  \n   \nOrganismo causal \n \n Por mucho tiempo se pens\u00f3 que la \u201cpeste negra\u201d era o casionada por un solo virus, el TSWV (sigla de \ntomato spotted wilt virus en ingl\u00e9s) pero recientemente se  descubri\u00f3 que en realidad era un grupo de virus similares \na TSWV  que se denominan Tospovirus  que presentan algunas diferencias sobretodo en preferencia del vector y \nrango de hu\u00e9spedes.   \nSeg\u00fan lo relevamientos realizados en Argentina los m\u00e1s frecuentes son: Tomato spotted wilt virus, TSWV \n(Provincia de Buenos Aires), Tomato chlorotic spot virus, TCSV (en el NE, incluyendo litoral del R\u00edo Uruguay)  y \nGroundnut ringspot virus, GRSV (en la parte central y NW, incluyendo Mendoza).  Seg\u00fan reportes de Brasil,  \nTSWV es frecuente en los estados de Paran\u00e1 y en Brasilia , TCSV en San Pablo y GRSV en el nordeste (valle del \nR\u00edo San Francisco, Pernambuco).  \n \nRango de hu\u00e9spedes  \n \n Esta enfermedad afecta una gran cantidad de plantas ya sea cultivadas o malezas de familias muy distintas \n(por lo menos 550 especies pertenecientes a m\u00e1s de 50 familias).  \nEntre los cultivos hort\u00edcolas afectados  se encuentran: tomate, morr\u00f3n, be renjena, lechuga, espinaca, papa, \ncoliflor, apio, endibia, arve ja, chaucha, cebolla, remolach as, coles varias, cu curbit\u00e1ceas, alcaucil, porotos, arvejas, \nhabas, etc.  Tambi\u00e9n son hu\u00e9spedes de peste negra, culti vos florales (dalia, zinia, amapola, petunia, orqu\u00eddeas, \ncrisantemos, gladiolos, geranios, etc.),  y algunos ex tensivos (tabaco, man\u00ed, soja, algod\u00f3n, girasol, alfalfa). \nDentro de las malezas que pueden hospedar a este vi rus se pueden nombrar: ver dolaga, corrig\u00fcela, lengua \nde vaca, malva, varias compuestas  ( Sonchus  spp, amor seco, senecio, diente de le\u00f3n), solan\u00e1ceas ( Datura  spp., \nNicotiana  spp.), cruc\u00edferas (bolsa de past or, mastuerzo), chenopodi\u00e1ceas (chamico y Chenopodium  spp.),  \nAmaranthus sp.,  algunas gram\u00edneas (gramilla, poa) y  varias leguminosas.  De esta lista se deben prestar especial atenci\u00f3n a a quellas plantas que adem\u00e1s de ser hu\u00e9spedes del virus son \npreferidas por los trips. \n \nS\u00edntomas \n \n\u00c9stos son variables con la edad de la planta al mo mento de la infecci\u00f3n, las condiciones ambientales y la \ncepa del virus involucrada. \nAl igual que casi todos los virus, cuanto m\u00e1s temprano en la  vida de la planta se d\u00e9  la infecci\u00f3n, peor es su \nefecto sobre \u00e9sta.  \nLos ataques tempranos de peste negra producen en anismo con producci\u00f3n nula o escasa e incluso pueden \nprovocar la  muerte de la planta. Lo primero que se observa  es la detenci\u00f3n del crecimien to en el brote terminal y \nenrollamiento de las hojas hacia abajo. Luego se produce el amarillamiento de las hojas j\u00f3venes y aparecen manchas  66 de color oscuro-bronceado en casi toda  la planta.  Las zonas afectadas crecen y pueden volverse completamente \nmarrones, mientras tanto la zona apical se marchita. \nSi la planta llega a producir frutos \u00e9stos son de  tama\u00f1o reducido, con c\u00edrculos o anillos en relieve. \nEn infecciones m\u00e1s tard\u00edas los s\u00edntomas son m\u00e1s leves, observ\u00e1ndose casi \u00fanicamente manchas amarillas \ncon fondo rojo en el fruto y el efecto sobre los rendimientos es bajo. \n Respecto a la variaci\u00f3n de los s\u00edntomas seg\u00fan la cepa de l virus, en nuestra regi\u00f3n se pueden observar por lo \nmenos dos tipos de s\u00edntomas que se podr\u00eda pensar que corresponden a difere ntes cepas o virus de este grupo. \nAdem\u00e1s de los s\u00edntomas mencionados antes, ap arecen otros no tan graves , observ\u00e1ndose \u00fanicamente \nabarquillamiento de las hojas y coloraci\u00f3n viol\u00e1cea de las nerv aduras en el env\u00e9s de \u00e9sta s, sin producirse la muerte \nde tejidos ni de la planta. S\u00ed se observa detenci\u00f3n de crecimiento, moteados y mosaicos. \n Se deben distinguir los s\u00edntomas en variedades suscep tibles, descritos en los p\u00e1rrafos anteriores, de los que \nocurren en variedades resistentes. En \u00e9stas, generalmente no se ven s\u00edntomas en follaje, pero s\u00ed anillos deprimidos de \ncolor marr\u00f3n oscuro en frutos. En algunos casos puede observarse un peque\u00f1o porcentaje de plantas con s\u00edntomas \nsimilares a los que ocurren en plantas susceptibles. \n \nTransmisi\u00f3n de la enfermedad \n \n Esta virosis es transmitida por varias especies de trips entre las que se destacan: Frankliniella schultzei, F. \noccidentalis, F. fusca, y  Thrips tabaci  (trips de la cebolla), siendo los dos primeros los m\u00e1s eficientes. La capacidad \nde transmisi\u00f3n est\u00e1 muy relacionada tambi\u00e9n al vi rus o cepa de virus predominante en la regi\u00f3n. \n Los trips pueden adquirir el virus de la peste negra \u00fanicamente como larva y lo transmiten como adulto. Por \nlo tanto, para poder transmitirlo, las la rvas deben alimentarse en plantas enfermas, cumplir su ciclo y los adultos \nvolar a plantas sanas. \n La forma de transmisi\u00f3n de peste negra se denomina \u201cpersistente\u201d. Los trips se  vuelven infectivos al \nalimentarse en una planta enferma (durante  15-30 minutos),  lo incuba sin poderlo transmitir (4-10 d\u00edas) y luego lo \ntransmite como adulto (en alimentacione s breves). Conserva la capacidad de tr ansmisi\u00f3n  por 22-30 d\u00edas y  a veces \nde por  vida pudiendo infectar  muchas plantas durante su vida.     Se ha avanzado mucho en el conocimiento de esta en fermedad y en particular en la relaci\u00f3n con el vector, \nahora se sabe que el virus se multiplica dentro del trip s, que lo enferma y que en casos no muy frecuentes, una \nhembra infectada lo puede pasar a su descendencia. \n La posibilidad de transmisi\u00f3n de pest e negra por semilla en tomate (1%) a \u00fan est\u00e1 en controversia, pero \u00e9sta \nser\u00eda, aparentemente, en los tejidos superficiales (t esta) y no en el embri\u00f3n. \n \nControl  \n \n El control de esta enfermedad es sumamente dif\u00edcil porque: \n \n\u2022 El gran n\u00famero de plantas susceptibles asegura la pe rpetuaci\u00f3n del virus y proporciona fuentes de contagio \nentre cultivos. \n \n\u2022 Una vez infectado, el insecto vector lo puede transmitir t oda su vida y por lo tanto viajar con \u00e9l entre plantas y \ncultivos. Adem\u00e1s lo transmite f\u00e1cilmente durante a limentaciones breves antes de ser controlado por un \ninsecticida. \n   Como toda enfermedad a virus no hay cura posible una vez que una planta est\u00e1 enferma, solo podemos \nprevenir la infecci\u00f3n y minimizar su efecto.  \nA tales efectos se recomienda: \n \n1) Usar siempre que sea posible variedades resistentes.  Varias casas comerciales tienen variedades de tomate \ncon calidad y rendimientos aceptables que poseen genes de resistencia a peste negra (g eneralmente se trata del \ngen Stevens Sw5 de L. peruvianum, aunque se est\u00e1n estudiando otros). Esta resistencia tiene a veces problemas \ny  las plantas pueden mostrar s\u00edntomas, sobretodo en frutos.   \n  67 2) Eliminar malezas  sensibles a peste negra y posibles reserv\u00f3r eos de trips dentro y fuera del cultivo. \n \n3) Revisar el cultivo para detectar aparici\u00f3n de plantas enfermas en sus etapas iniciales y eliminarlas . \n 4) Evitar la plantaci\u00f3n cerca de cultivos susceptibles  a peste negra. \n \n5) Proteger los alm\u00e1cigos de infecciones precoces mediante el uso de mallas anti-insectos . \n \n6) Eliminar totalmente el rastrojo y dejar un intervalo de  por lo menos 15 d\u00edas antes de plantar en el mismo \nterreno  cultivos susceptibles. De esa forma se evita que los trips que emerjan infectados del suelo (pupas) \ntransmitan peste negra al cultivo siguiente. \n \n7) El control de trips con aplicaciones reiteradas de insecticidas para impedir la transmisi\u00f3n en el cultivo no \ngarantiza la no transmisi\u00f3n del virus.

La \nenfermedades mencionadas no han si do reportadas en Uruguay y por lo tanto esta publicaci\u00f3n busca solamente \ninformar acerca de las caracter\u00edsticas de  las mismas y los m\u00e9todos de manejo  usados en otras regiones eso nos \nayudar\u00e1 a evitar su introducci\u00f3n al pa\u00eds y minimi zar su impacto en caso de  que eso ocurra. \n \nVirus transmitidos a tomate y morr\u00f3n por moscas blancas  \n \n Las moscas blancas tienen la capacida d de transmitir dos grupos de virus: \n1) Closteroviridae , g\u00e9nero  Crinivirus   y  2) Geminiviridae , g\u00e9nero Begomovirus (com\u00fanmente conocidos como \ngeminivirus).   \nCrinivirus:  \n Virus en forma de filamento, alargados transmitidos por Trialeurodes vaporariorum y/o Bemisia tabaci  en \nforma semipersistente. Dentro de este grupo se encuentran:  Tomato infectiuous chlorosis virus (TICV) y Tomato \nchlorosis virus (ToCV).  TICV se encuentra pres ente en EE.UU. (transmitido por ambas especies de moscas) y  \nToCV en la cuenca del Mediterr\u00e1neo (transmitido solo por Bemisia tabaci ) desde los a\u00f1os 90.  Los s\u00edntomas que se \nobservan son: \u00e1reas clor\u00f3ticas irregulares en las hojas que provocan amarillamiento entre nervaduras, arrollado de \nhojas, follaje seco y fr\u00e1gil. Los s\u00edntom as empiezan desde las hojas basales haci a arriba , los frutos son de menor \ntama\u00f1o y maduran m\u00e1s tarde. Estos problemas son confundi dos con deficiencias de nutrientes pero tienen la \nparticularidad que siempre comienzan desde los bordes de  los invernaderos hacia adentro y est\u00e1n asociados a \ngrandes ataques de mosca blanca.   \n \nGeminivirus : \n Virus poli\u00e9dricos (forma similar a dos part\u00edc ulas pegadas, de all\u00ed el nombre \u201cgemini\u201d). \n Hasta 1980s los problemas con virus de la familia Geminiviridae en Am\u00e9rica estaban restringidos \nfundamentalmente a leguminosas. En ese momento la s ituaci\u00f3n cambi\u00f3 y aparecieron problemas importantes en \ncultivos hort\u00edcolas (tomate, cucurbit \u00e1ceas y porotos), habi\u00e9ndose reportado hasta el momento 17  geminivirus \ndiferentes en tomate en el continente  americano. Todos son transmitidos por Bemisia tabaci  de forma persistente y \ncirculativa; y sobretodo muy eficientemente por el bioti po B de este insecto, el cual se cree que ha sido el \nresponsable de la importancia  y la mayor distribuci\u00f3n que est\u00e1n teniendo estas enfermedades en nuestro continente \ndesde 1980s. Los geminivirus no son transmitidos por otros medios (contacto, semilla, etc.).  Los s\u00edntomas que \nprovocan var\u00edan con la cepa, cultivar, edad de la planta a la infecci\u00f3n y condiciones ambientales. Generalmente se \nobservan mosaicos amarillos brillantes, mo teados clor\u00f3ticos, clorosis en los m\u00e1rgenes de las hojas, enrrollamiento \nde las mismas, deformaci\u00f3n foliar, ampollado, reducci\u00f3n de tama\u00f1o de las hojas, enanismo y ca\u00edda de flores.    \n La situaci\u00f3n y los tipos de virus son diferentes en  las distintas regiones de Am\u00e9rica, por ejemplo: \n1) En EE.UU. donde se tienen registros de B. tabaci  desde el siglo XIX ingresa en 1987 el biotipo B y comienzan \nlos problemas con Tomato mottle virus  (ToMoV) en el estado de Florida que se disemina a estados vecinos. Este \nvirus ataca \u00fanicamente a tomate.  Simult\u00e1 neamente aparecen otros problemas en la fronter a con M\u00e9jico que tambi\u00e9n \nafectan a morr\u00f3n y otras solan\u00e1ceas:  Texas pepper virus (TPV), Pepper huasteco  virus (PHV) y Serrano golden \nmosaic virus  (SGMV).  \n2) En M\u00e9jico se citan numerosos virus de este grupo en tomate y otra s solan\u00e1ceas adem\u00e1s de los descritos en la \nfrontera con EEUU:  Chino del tomate (CdTV), Sinaloa tomato leaf curl virus (STLCV), Tomato leaf crumple virus  \n(TLCrV), \u201crizado amarillo\u201d y  \u201ctigre\u201d del tomate. \n3) En Am\u00e9rica Central se han reportado varias enfermedades de este tipo pero a\u00fan est\u00e1 en  estudio si son nuevas o las \nmismas reportadas en M\u00e9jico.  69 4) En el Caribe, B. tabaci biotipo B apareci\u00f3 en 1987 y desde 1992 se determina Tomato yellow leaf curl virus \n(TYLCV, o virus de la cuchara) introducido con plantin es desde Israel. A partir de ese momento TYLCV se \ndisemina a Cuba, Jamaica, etc. y al estado de Florida, EE UU.  Si bien se citan otros hu\u00e9spedes de TYLCV (algunas \nmalezas, poroto, ornamentales y morr\u00f3n)  su principal hu\u00e9sped es tomate.  TYLCV est\u00e1 adem\u00e1s diseminado en la \ncuenca del Mediterr\u00e1neo, \u00c1frica y Australia. Existen dos va riantes principales: TYLCV-Is (tipo Israel) y TYLCV-S \n(tipo Cerde\u00f1a) y otras menores. \nTambi\u00e9n en el Caribe se encuentra Potato yellow mosaic virus  (PYMV) en tomate desde 1992. \n5) En Sudam\u00e9rica son solo dos los pa\u00edses en que se ha n reportado geminivirus en tomate y cultivos relacionados: \nVenezuela y  Brasil.  En Venezuela se determinaron Tomato yellow mosaic virus  y  PYMV en tomate y papa  con \ngraves consecuencias.  En Bras il en los a\u00f1os 60 se report\u00f3 a Tomato golden mosaic virus  en Minas Gerais del cual \nactualmente se citan dos vari antes y un virus relacionado: Tomato yellow vein streak virus (ToYVSV) en el estado \nde San Pablo.  B. tabaci  biotipo B se determin\u00f3 en 1990 en San Pabl o y se ha ido distribuyendo a otros estados \n(Paran\u00e1, R\u00edo de Janeiro, Bah\u00eda y Pernambuco).     \n \nMedidas para el manejo de estas enfermedades  \n \n Nos referiremos principalmente al manejo de las enfermedades causadas por geminivirus, aunque muchas \nde las medidas son aplicables a los criniv irus. En primer lugar se debe resaltar lo dif\u00edcil del mismo y la necesidad de \nque las medidas sean tomadas en forma regional busca ndo reducir las poblaciones del vector y las fuentes de \nin\u00f3culo.  \n En aquellos casos en que el hu\u00e9sped principal es el tomate, es eficient e la destrucci\u00f3n de plantas y cultivos \nenfermos y la promoci\u00f3n en la zona de un per\u00edodo libre de mosca blanca (eliminar los hu\u00e9spedes de la misma) y de \ncultivos susceptibles. Esta medida es llevada con \u00e9xito en el control de ToMoV en Florida (EEUU) y de TYLCV en \nRep\u00fablica Dominicana.   Uso de cultivares resistentes. Por el momento no se han logrado cultivares resistentes a la alimentaci\u00f3n del \nvector y \u00fanicamente  se han obtenido cultivares tolerant es a la multiplicaci\u00f3n de TYLCV. Esos cultivares a veces \n(no siempre) pueden comportarse como tolerantes a otro s geminivirus. La fuente de resistencia proviene de \nLycopersicon chilense  y de  L. pimpinelifollium , puede ser del tipo monog\u00e9nica o cuantitativa, pero la dominancia \nes incompleta y condicionada por genes menores. Esa resist encia permite la multiplicaci\u00f3n de virus en la planta y \npuede ser superada con alta s poblaciones de moscas infectadas o si la s plantas son inoculadas muy j\u00f3venes. \n Debido a lo anterior es conveniente que los alm \u00e1cigos sean realizados en zonas lejos de cultivos \ncomerciales o bajo protecci \u00f3n (malla anti-insecto).  \n En invernaderos en Europa es com\u00fan el uso de mallas anti-insectos comple mentado con pl\u00e1sticos que \nfiltran UV en la prevenci\u00f3n de estas virosis. \n Otro factor a tener en  cuenta es la distancia a cu ltivos m\u00e1s viejos y la direcci\u00f3n del viento para prevenir la \nmigraci\u00f3n de moscas infectadas con virus. Se ha demost rado en algunos casos la mayor importancia de la infecci\u00f3n \ndesde otros cultivos que la ocurrida  dentro del cultivo en estudio. \n No nos referiremos aqu\u00ed en detalle al  uso de insecticidas para prevenir la  transmisi\u00f3n pero  tambi\u00e9n integran \nel paquete de prevenci\u00f3n de estas virosis.     70 MANEJO DE LA MOSCA BLANCA ( Trialeurodes vaporariorum ) EN PRODUCCI\u00d3N \nINTEGRADA EN EL CULTIVO DE TOMATE EN LA ZONA SUR DEL PA\u00cdS \n \nJorge Paullier \nSecci\u00f3n Protecci\u00f3n Vegetal \nINIA Las Brujas \npaullier@inia.org.uy \n \n \n \n\u2022 La mosca blanca Trialeurodes vaporariorum  es uno de los m\u00e1s importantes problemas de plagas de la \nhorticultura, principalmente en condiciones de cu ltivos protegidos, como tomate, morr\u00f3n y mel\u00f3n. \n \n\u2022 Insecto muy peque\u00f1o: los adultos miden 1,2 mm de lar go. Cuerpo de color amarillento, cubierto por un fino \npolvillo blanco, causa de la coloraci \u00f3n muy blanca caracter\u00edstica de las alas. \n \n\u2022 El cultivo es perjudicado por la acci\u00f3n tanto de larvas como de adultos de mosca blanca. \n \n\u2022 La plaga se alimenta de la epidermis de las hojas, s obre el env\u00e9s o lado inferior, succionando la savia de los \ntejidos. Provoca el debilitando de las plantas y afecta el crecimiento y la producci\u00f3n. \n \n\u2022 Las larvas producen secreciones azucaradas que se depos itan sobre hojas y frutos, favoreciendo la formaci\u00f3n de \nfumagina y depreciando la calid ad comercial de los frutos. \n  \nMONITOREO DE LA PLAGA\n  \n \n\u2022 La t\u00e9cnica recomendada es la revi saci\u00f3n peri\u00f3dica de las plantas y la observaci\u00f3n directa de la plaga. \n \n\u2022 Se deben realizar inspecciones al menos  semanales, revisando plantas al azar (en diferentes partes del cuadro) \nque sean representativas de l desarrollo del cultivo.  \n \n\u2022 Uso de trampas amarillas adhesivas. \n \n\u2022 Por invernadero de 1000 metros cuadrados o por hect\u00e1rea de cultivo a campo, se deben revisar por lo menos 20 \nplantas en total. \n \n\u2022 Dividir el cuadro  en cuatro partes para reali zar el trabajo por cuadrante. \n  \n\u2022 En cada planta se observan tres hojas, de la zona superior, media e inferior , examinando el lado inferior (env\u00e9s) \nde los fol\u00edolos. \n \n\u2022 En cada planta se determina el porcentaje de fol\u00edolos c on presencia de larvas vivas y/o adultos (m\u00e1s de dos \nindividuos). \n \n \nMANEJO DE LA PLAGA  \n \n\u2022 Destrucci\u00f3n de malezas hospederas. \n \n\u2022 Eliminaci\u00f3n de restos vegetales de  los deshojes y/o desbrotes. \n \n\u2022 Evitar siembras escalonadas. \n  71 \u2022 Destrucci\u00f3n de rastrojos. \n \n\u2022 Control f\u00edsico: trampas amarillas adhesivas. \n \n\u2022 Umbral de intervenci\u00f3n: \n \n- 30% de fol\u00edolos con presencia de larv as vivas y/o adultos (m\u00e1s de dos   \n        individuos). \n \n\u2022 Utilizar el control qu\u00edmico una vez alcanzado el umbral predeterminado. \n \n\u2022 Una vez tomada la decisi\u00f3n de curar, utilizar productos recomendados teniendo presente  los tiempos de espera. \n \n \nPRODUCTOS RECOMENDADOS \n \nPrincipio Activo Nombre Comercial Concentraci\u00f3n  \nPA Dosis \ng-cc /100 l Carencia  \n(d\u00edas) \nBuprofezin Applaud 25 PM 25 % 100 g 14 \nImidacloprid  Confidor 350 SC  350 g/l 60 cc \n1,0 l /h\u00e1 (1) 3 \nDiafentiuron  Polo 500 SC 500 g/l 60 cc 7 \nAcetamiprid Mospilan 20 % 50 g 7 \nPyriproxyfen Epingle 10 IGR 10 % 25 - 50 cc 14 \n    (1) Su aplicaci\u00f3n  es a trav\u00e9s de riego localizado. \n  72 USO DE SISTEMAS DE PRON\u00d3STICO  EN EL MANEJO INTEGRADO DE \nENFERMEDADES EN HORTALIZAS \n \nDiego C. Maeso \nSecci\u00f3n Protecci\u00f3n Vegetal \nINIA Las Brujas \n  \n1) Introducci\u00f3n \n \n El uso abusivo a nivel mundial de pesticidas incen tiv\u00f3 el desarrollo de una pr oducci\u00f3n muy dependiente de \nagrot\u00f3xicos, aparici\u00f3n de pat\u00f3genos resistentes,  dest rucci\u00f3n de organismos diferentes a la plaga o pat\u00f3geno, \nsurgimiento de nuevas plagas o enfermedades y problemas secundarios,  contaminaci\u00f3n ambiental, y  problemas de \nsalud humana.  Sumado a eso, el p\u00fablico y las autoridade s a nivel mundial se preocupan cada vez m\u00e1s por  la \nexistencia de residuos de pesticidas en  los alimentos y su efecto nocivo contra el medio ambiente. Por lo tanto, las \nregulaciones internacionales son cada vez m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil en el registro de nuevos pe sticidas o el mantenimiento de los \nvigentes.  Como una forma de contribuir a solucionar algunos de esas limitantes ha surgido el manejo integrado de \nplagas (aqu\u00ed consideraremos las plagas en su sentido amplio incluyendo enfermedades, MIP). El MIP entre otras \ncosas busca: 1) Optimizar el control en una manera razonablemente econ\u00f3mica y ecol\u00f3gica. \n2) Enfatizar en el uso coordinado de m\u00faltiples t\u00e9cnicas pa ra aumentar la producci\u00f3n estable de los cultivos (control \nbiol\u00f3gico, qu\u00edmico, legal, gen\u00e9tico  y cultural) \n3) Mantener el da\u00f1o de la plaga o enfermedad en ni veles bajos pero minimizando los peligros para humanos, \nanimales, planta y ambiente. \n  En nuestro pa\u00eds, a partir de 1997 entran en funci onamiento los programas pilotos de producci\u00f3n integrada \nde hortalizas gracias a un esfuerzo conjunto de PR EDEG-GTZ, JUNAGRA, Facultad de Agronom\u00eda e INIA.  \nActualmente se certifican cultivos de ajo, cebolla, to mate (invernadero y campo), lechuga y frutilla, existiendo \nproyectos de futuro en ma\u00edz dulce y boniato, comprendiendo m\u00e1s de 100 productores.  \n La meta de esos programas es la producci\u00f3n median te el uso de m\u00e9todos respetuosos del ambiente que \ncontemplen los recursos naturales y  la salud humana y logrando a la vez un producto na tural diferenciado con mejor \ncomercializaci\u00f3n siendo el MIP uno de  sus principales componentes.  \nSi bien las medidas culturales son muy \u00fatiles para el manejo de enfermedades, retardando o inhibiendo \nparcialmente la evoluci\u00f3n de la en fermedad, nunca logran sustituir completamente el uso de fungicidas.   \n Todos sabemos que una enfermedad es el resultado de la interacci\u00f3n:  pat \u00f3geno-hu\u00e9sped - condiciones \nambientales. Por lo tanto, una buena  estrategia consiste en aplicar los agroqu\u00edmicos cuando las condiciones \nambientales son favorables para los procesos por los cu ales el pat\u00f3geno produce la enfermedad (esporulaci\u00f3n, \ngerminaci\u00f3n de esporas, infecci\u00f3n).  Esa es trategia permite el ahorro de apli caciones y  el posicionamiento de las \nmismas cuando realmente son necesarias.  Es con esa finalidad que se desarro llan los llamados \"Sistemas de Alarma \no Pron\u00f3stico de Enfermedades\".    \n2) Sistemas de pron\u00f3stico de enfermedades.  \n El pron\u00f3stico de enfermedades es la habilidad de predecir cuando una enfermedad va a ocurrir a niveles \nimportantes antes de que \u00e9sta lo ha ga, bas\u00e1ndose en informaci\u00f3n clim\u00e1tica,  del cultivo o del pat\u00f3geno.   Esa \npredicci\u00f3n permite a los productores desarrollar estrategias e implementar t\u00e1cticas de manejo de manera r\u00e1pida y \neficiente. \n Muchos de los sistemas de pron\u00f3stico en realidad no \"pronostican\" sino que identifican cuando ya se han \nregistrado per\u00edodos de infecci\u00f3n y por  ello muchos autores prefieren llamarlos \"sistemas de alarma\". \n Para que un sistema de pron\u00f3stico sea exitoso debe reunir ciertas caracter\u00edsticas:  73 1) Confiabilidad. Basado en informaci\u00f3n biol\u00f3gica y ambi ental s\u00f3lida, y adecuadamente evaluado en la regi\u00f3n \ndonde se aplica. \n2) Simplicidad. Cuanto  m\u00e1s simple, mejor ser\u00e1 su aceptaci\u00f3n. \n3) Importancia.  La enfermedad deber\u00e1  ser importante econ\u00f3micamente y tambi\u00e9n lo deber\u00e1n ser los beneficios en el \ncontrol. \n4) Utilidad.  La enfermedad pronosticada deber\u00e1  contar con m\u00e9todos efectivos de manejo. \n5) Disponibilidad.  Se deber\u00e1 contar con equipo adecuado para realizar el pron\u00f3stico y comunicarlo al usuario.  \n6) Aplicaci\u00f3n m\u00faltiple. Que el equipo usado sirva tambi\u00e9n pa ra otros fines (enfermedades, plagas o registro de \nclima). \n7) Costo razonable.  Los costos incurridos deber\u00e1n estar en concordancia con los beneficios logrados. \n  2.1 ) Desarrollo de sistemas de pron\u00f3stico de enfermedades. \n \nLa primer etapa en el proceso de un sistema de pron\u00f3stico es su desarrollo , es decir su creaci\u00f3n. En base al \ntipo de informaci\u00f3n que se maneja en el desarrollo, los sistem as pueden clasificarse en:  1) si usan informaci\u00f3n sobre \nel cultivo, la enfermedad , el pat\u00f3geno, el ambiente o combinaciones de \u00e9s tos; 2) si las advertencias son  pre o post- \nplantaci\u00f3n;  3) si para el desarrollo del sistema se us\u00f3 informaci\u00f3n emp\u00edrica o \"fundamental\"  y  4)  de acuerdo a las \ncaracter\u00edsticas epidem iol\u00f3gicas usadas.  \n 2.1.1) Sistemas de pron\u00f3stico \"fundamentales\" y \"emp\u00edricos\". \n \n Un sistema de pron\u00f3stico se considera \"fundamental\"  si fue desarrollado en base a experimentos en \nlaboratorio, c\u00e1maras de crecimiento, invernaderos o campo y describe uno o m\u00e1s aspectos de la relaci\u00f3n hu\u00e9sped-\npar\u00e1sito influenciados por el ambiente. Se trata de rel aciones causa-efecto determinadas  experimentalmente y toman \nen cuenta la influencia sobre los co mponentes del ciclo de la enfermedad, p.ej.  infecci\u00f3n, esporulaci\u00f3n, dispersi\u00f3n \nde in\u00f3culo, etc.  El componente m\u00e1s estudiado es la in fecci\u00f3n, determin\u00e1ndose \"per\u00edodos  de infecci\u00f3n\" relacionados \ncon condiciones clim\u00e1ticas p.ej. temper aturas y duraci\u00f3n de follaje mojado.  \nUn sistema de pron\u00f3stico se considera \"emp\u00edrico\"  cuando fue desarrollado en base a la observaci\u00f3n y \nan\u00e1lisis de informaci\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica de niveles de enfermed ad y factores bi\u00f3ticos y abi\u00f3ticos. En este caso, las \nrelaciones entre los par\u00e1metros son simult\u00e1neas pero a v eces se encuentran relaciones directas causa-efecto.   \n Los sistemas emp\u00edricos pueden clas ificarse en: 1) aquellos que realizan una \u00fanica predicci\u00f3n por estaci\u00f3n o \n2) que involucran predicciones m\u00faltiples.    \n1) En el primer caso los sistemas son \u00fatiles para rea lizar predicciones del in\u00f3culo inicial o el nivel temprano \nde la enfermedad  o cuando s\u00f3lo una intervenci\u00f3n es ec on\u00f3micamente viable.  Pueden ser cualitativos (Si/No) o \ncuantitativos. \nEn los cualitativos, los pron\u00f3sticos pue den ser realizados en base a dato s clim\u00e1ticos (enfermedades cuya \nsupervivencia entre temporadas depende de condiciones clim\u00e1ticas) o en base a la intensidad de la enfermedad en \netapas tempranas (determinaci\u00f3n de \"nivel cr\u00edtico de enfe rmedad\" adecuado para realizar la primer aplicaci\u00f3n de \nfungicidas, por ej. para controlar botritis en cebolla (10).  \nEn los cuantitativos, los pron\u00f3sticos  est\u00e1n basados en ecuaciones de regresi\u00f3n m\u00faltiple que involucran \nnumerosas t\u00e9cnicas de estad\u00edstica y se  definen rangos de condiciones clim\u00e1ticas  que desembocar\u00e1n en grados de la \nenfermedad graves, medios o leves para esa temporada. \n2) Los sistemas con predicciones m\u00faltiples se adecu an a cultivos que son manejados intensivamente y \nreciben numerosas aplicaciones de agroqu\u00edmicos por tem porada. Tambi\u00e9n pueden ser de desarrollo cualitativo o \ncuantitativo. \nEn los sistemas de desarrollo cualitativo la info rmaci\u00f3n clim\u00e1tica hist\u00f3rica es simplificada por el \ninvestigador en un damero de continge ncias en las que se asignan valores or dinales (valores de severidad) que \nexpresan lo favorable de las condiciones ambientales. Las aplicaciones se hacen cuando la acumulaci\u00f3n de esos \nvalores de severidad llega a un nivel cr\u00edtic o.  Ese nivel cr\u00edtico puede derivar del an\u00e1lisis hist\u00f3rico o de experimentos \nposteriores de ajuste. Ejemplos de este tipo lo c onstituyen los programas TOMCAST para pron\u00f3stico de tiz\u00f3n \ntemprano en tomate (6),  BLITECAST para tiz\u00f3n tard\u00edo  en papa (4), etc. \nEn los sistemas de desarrollo cuantitativo de predicci\u00f3n m\u00faltiple se aplican las descripciones realizadas en \nlos de predicci\u00f3n \u00fanica cuantitativos con la  diferencia que se realizan varias predicciones por temporada. Ejemplos \nde este tipo son BLIGHT-ALERT  (13) o el Spore Index Predictive System para pron\u00f3stico de botritis en cebolla \n(5). Generalmente el manejo con tipo de sistemas es vinc ulados con el poder residual de  los productos empleados.    \n    74 2.1.2)  Sistemas de pron\u00f3stico de acu erdo a las caracter\u00edsticas epidemiol\u00f3gicas. \n  Los sistemas de pron\u00f3stico pueden clasificarse de acuer do a las caracter\u00edsticas epidem iol\u00f3gicas usadas en si \nprestan atenci\u00f3n al in\u00f3culo primario, al secundario o a ambos.   \nEn el caso de enfermedades monoc\u00edclicas (un solo ciclo de producci\u00f3n de in\u00f3culo por temporada) o en \naquellas en que el in\u00f3culo inicial es m\u00e1s importante que los ciclos secundarios  de producci\u00f3n de in\u00f3culo  (baja tasa \nde aumento de enfermedad) la predicci\u00f3n se realiza en base a la cantidad o eficiencia del in\u00f3culo inicial .   \nLa estimaci\u00f3n del nivel de in\u00f3culo a ser usado en  la predicci\u00f3n puede ser indirecta (condiciones \nambientales propicias para su supervivencia) o dir ecta (midiendo el nivel de prop\u00e1gulos en muestras)  \n    Algunos de estos sistemas tambi\u00e9n toman en cuenta  las condiciones ambientales que afectan la eficacia del \nin\u00f3culo inicial (P.ej. sistemas que identifi can per\u00edodos de infecci\u00f3n por ascosporas de Venturia inaequalis basados \nen per\u00edodos de hoja mojada y temperatura c on modificaciones de las tablas de Mills). \n Si el pat\u00f3geno tiene la capacidad de  realizar varios ciclos secundarios  de producci\u00f3n de in\u00f3culo durante una \nestaci\u00f3n y elevar r\u00e1pidamente el nive l de \u00e9ste, los sistemas de pron\u00f3stico an\u00e1lizan las condiciones ambientales que \nafectan a los ciclos secundarios  de producci\u00f3n de in\u00f3culo .  Tambi\u00e9n en este caso se  pueden separar aquellos que \nrealizan la advertencia en base a condiciones clim\u00e1ticas  (la mayor\u00eda de los pron\u00f3sticos  disponibles) o aquellos que \nmiden el nivel de in\u00f3culo (p. ej. pron\u00f3stic os en base a captura de esporas).  \n   2.2) Validaci\u00f3n  \n \n Los sistemas de pron\u00f3stico nunca deben ser utilizados en  una regi\u00f3n sin una validaci\u00f3n previa en diferentes \nmicroclimas y  temporadas, de forma de observar la eficaci a de las diferentes alterna tivas de advertencia.  La \nvalidaci\u00f3n deber\u00e1 incluir sistemas alterna tivos (standard del productor) y de ser pos ible parcelas sin control.  Deber\u00e1 \nprestarse suma atenci\u00f3n a aspectos pr\u00e1cticos como fungi cidas usados, aplicaciones apr opiadas, reiteraci\u00f3n de \u00e9stas \npor lavado por lluvias, etc.  \n De ser preciso se podr\u00e1n hacer ajustes locales ya s ea para disminuir aplicaciones excesivas o para corregir \ndefectos.   \n En nuestro caso, en el per\u00edodo 1994- 2002, en  INIA La s Brujas se han realizado validaciones de diferentes \nsistemas para el pron\u00f3stico de enfermedades foliares de cebolla tales como BLIGHT-ALERT (13), Spore Index \nPredictive System (5), y DOWNCAST (4) propon\u00edendose algunas variantes de los mismos para nuestras \ncondiciones. \n 2.3) Implementaci\u00f3n \n \n De nada sirve contar con m\u00faltiples programas y de buena calidad si no son utilizados por los productores, \npor ello esta etapa es cr\u00edtica y ha significado el fracaso de excelentes pr ogramas del punto de vista biol\u00f3gico. \n Muchas veces la no adopci\u00f3n de un sistema de pron\u00f3s ticos puede explicarse:  por la tendencia de los \nproductores a no aceptar riesgos (que son mayores comparados con calendarios f ijos), porque se requi eren ajustes en \nla operativa del predio (en el caso de predios grandes la aplicaci\u00f3n a todo el pr edio deber\u00e1 ser hecha r\u00e1pidamente), \npor aumento de costos derivados de la  compra de equipos, la operativa diaria  puede ser alterada por un aviso de \naplicaci\u00f3n, la aplicaci\u00f3n no puede realizar se a pesar de la advertencia pues el tiempo o el terreno no lo permiten, y \npor \u00faltimo al disminuir las aplicaciones de fungicidas puede n emerger problemas menores que eran controlados con \nel esquema anterior.   \n \n         75  \n \n3) Algunos ejemplos de sistemas de pron\u00f3stico aplicados a horticultura. \n \n En el cuadro 1 a modo de ejemplo se muestran los si stemas de pron\u00f3stico de enfermedades de hortalizas y \nel estado de los mismos en el estado de California, EEUU, (California PestCast, http://www.cdpr. ca.gov/docs/ipminov/pestcast/models.htm),     \n \n Cuadro 1.

En un principi o \u00e9stos se basaban en elementos mec\u00e1n icos de registro (termohidr\u00f3grafos, \npluvi\u00f3metros, sensores de hoja mojada) ubicados en el cu ltivo o por lo menos en lugares definidos de los cuales \nhab\u00eda que copiar  la informaci\u00f3n para luego realizar lo s c\u00e1lculos en calculadoras pers onales o en una computadora \ncentral (mainframe).  Actual mente se cuentan con equipos comerciales que  realizan los c\u00e1lculos y simplemente dan \nun pron\u00f3stico (p. ej. Unidad Envirocaster) o estaciones mete orol\u00f3gicas  cuyos datos pueden ser le\u00eddos a distancia \n(telemetr\u00eda) sin reali zar grandes labores.  \n Sin embargo, los grandes desaf\u00edos contin\u00faan y la tendencia actual en el  tema es avanzar en dos aspectos: \n1) Creaci\u00f3n de sistemas expertos o sistemas de ayuda a la toma de decisiones (decision support systems) \nque involucran tambi\u00e9n no solo otros probl emas sanitarios (plagas, malezas, ne m\u00e1todos) sino otras labores a realizar \nen el cultivo dependientes del clima (p.ej. riego) (9).  Ya existen algunos  ejemplos como el programa WISDOM o \nPotato Disease Management de la Un iversidad de Wisconsin que cubre tiz\u00f3n temprano y tiz\u00f3n tard\u00edo y a su vez es \nuno de los cinco componentes del \"University of  Wisconsin Potato Crop Management System\" \n(http://ipcm.wisc.edu/apps/wisdom). \n2)  Toma de datos clim\u00e1ticos del cultivo sin la presencia de sensores en el mismo mediante interpolaci\u00f3n \nentre estaciones, modelos de simulaci\u00f3n y t \u00e9cnicas de agricultura  de precisi\u00f3n (8). \n \n \n \n \n  77  \nBibliograf\u00eda \n \n1.
