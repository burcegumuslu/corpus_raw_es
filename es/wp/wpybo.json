I believe that a shift from acute care and medication-based to the evaluation and addressing the underlying causes of health care issues as a new model of treatment; Modern Medicine for these Modern Times.\nModern times truly does require a modern medicine. Our 21st century life has brought about untold challenges (environmental pollution, soil nutrient deprivation, babies being born with toxicities and immune systems that are weak, effects of radiation of all types that we aren\u2019t aware of, and the overuse of antibiotics that destroy the normal healthy intestinal flora, just to name a few issues.\nIn reality, it\u2019s almost as if a\nnew human or a mutated form of who we used to be has been created. These changes create diseases that cannot be treated with the current healthcare approach of using yet another chemical (pharmaceutical medications).\nWhat we need to do is to get to the root cause of these problems and try to re-balance our bodies back to its original state. It\u2019s like rebooting the body to the state that nature has intended. This book is a Paradigm shift in medicine. MODERN MEDICINE for these modern times is a shift that\u2019s been needed to solve humanity\u2019s current chronic disease epidemic.\nToday\u2019s healthcare and treatment model doesn\u2019t really allow for the necessary time that your doctor needs to consider the entirety of you as a human being, and discovering exactly what is behind your feeling one or more symptoms.\nWe\u2019ll get into the time-shortage reasons later, but suffice it to say that we human beings are integrated organisms made up of a complex set of systems, which operate in an integrated manner so that we can go about our daily lives, whether we are working, playing, sleeping, eating or doing any of the many thousands of things that active humans do.\nWhen the human being is out of sync, things go wrong, people get sick, sometimes they get chronically ill, and often some calamity occurs and they are thrown into a healthcare system that would scare the heck out of anyone seeing it for the first time.\nToday\u2019s methods are a bit limited. Usually you will:\nBring the doctor a shortlist of your symptoms\nDoctor does cursory exam, part of it done by nurses, vital signs, weight, height, etc.\nDoctor palpates and/or checks you for the symptoms if at all (thorough physical exams are rarely done these days)\nDoctor either requests tests (blood, urine, stool, X-rays, scans etc.) or\nFrom your medical history and his years of experience with research, education, studies, of treatments of the symptoms, takes out his little white pad, writes you a prescription for some chemically-produced pharmaceutical medication to make the symptom more tolerable, or make the symptom completely go away, at least temporarily.\nBut the symptom treated isn\u2019t really gone. What\u2019s really happening is that it\u2019s burrowing underground, deeper within the same bodily system, whether digestive, respiratory, circulatory, etc. The symptom may be gone temporarily, but for example, gastritis treated by a prescription might actually transform into stomach cancer.\nAlthough this might happen as an end game result from not treating the person as a whole, other symptoms may occur within the same system and other another prescription may be given for the new symptom, and the chemicals mix together in the stomach and there is certainly the potential for the chemicals do damage the stomach, the intestines, and other systems throughout the body.\nIt\u2019s far wiser to gain the knowledge of what caused the primary symptom, and use the modalities presented herein to you, which are derived from the field of Functional Medicine to clean out any irritant or toxin from your body, build your immunity, and let your body heal itself naturally.\nIt\u2019s Your Choice\nThe methods of care and treatment, and who your doctor is that works with you towards achieving your own level of health and balance in life is all a matter of choice. You can select from many branches of medicine and healthcare, and whichever branch you choose, I hope that your chosen physician has studied the field of Functional Medicine to help your entire body, and the modalities presented that will help you return to Optimum Health that we will shortly discuss.\nTo give you a reason, let me begin by saying that I am a Medical Doctor who works with a specialty in Functional Medicine. Too often we get patients who have problems with their thyroid glands and the cause is an autoimmunity disorder. Simply state, these patients usually say that they have a problem going on and don\u2019t know exactly what it is.\nApparently there\u2019s now well-documented connection between those with illnesses that have been treated by pharmaceutical medication for long periods of time, and the symptoms still prevail, and doctors and the pharmaceutical industry are looking for other answers. You\u2019ll find those answers here in this book.\nThis is because the doctor they\u2019ve chosen to supervise, and evaluate the symptom, might do only one test (allowed by the insurance company) and give a prescription for medication for the patient\u2019s diagnosed symptom, which may or may not help, and perhaps later, try a second or third medication over a period of time \u2013 but in reality not really discover or treat systemic problem which caused the disease because it\u2019s never been diagnosed, nor find the root cause of it.\nBut, the undiagnosed problem could have been helped another way. Had the physician looked at the whole person, rather than one symptom, the process would have been easier, faster and more complete \u2013 and the natural healthful state would return and last for the entirety of the life of the patient.\nAs a physician I can tell you, that learning about your symptoms can tell me a great deal about your health, but treating you by eliminating symptoms with medication, rather than checking for possible links between a variety of symptoms and a variety bodily systems, is not the smartest way of attaining total and complete bodily health.\nWhen treating only the patient\u2019s symptom, with a medication, may not have much success.\nKnowing how important each of the different bodily systems are to the health of your whole body and how important it is to look at the whole person, your whole body when treating them as a physician, I have followed the Functional Medicine approach to finding the connections for every patient I see from the beginning of my working with them.\nLife is influenced by many factors. All of human existence is as well. Nothing in life is ever solely caused by one factor. There seems to be some form of interrelation between all elements and all of the processes in life.\nThe factors seem to be working together all the time, mostly 9 operating in unison. As an example: a wildflower growing in the woods doesn\u2019t get water one day, sunlight exposure the next day, and then another day get soil nutrients. The flower gets all that it needs simultaneously as nature provides it through a process that is similar to drip irrigation whereby water, sunlight, and nutrients are received in a trickling down process. That\u2019s what nature provides and intended and obviously attains the best results for accomplishing natural flower growth.\nIn my experience as a Functional Medicine practitioner, the best results are accomplished through nine areas of life which I\u2019ve identified these over the last 12 years while treating patients, especially those with chronic health issues.\nWhen all of these specific protocols are managed together using Functional Medicine modilities it considerably diminishes any potential of reoccurring health issues.\nSo, from the outset, let\u2019s make this perfectly clear. This book is NOT about using any one fix, or one discovery. This book is putting the knowledge, which I have personally accumulated from helping patients to regain their Optimum Health, and stay healthy. In front of you is a protocol \u2013 one that will make sense for your health and well-being everyday of your life.\nThousands of Guidebooks \u2013 In the Wrong Direction\nThere are thousands of books written on hundreds of different aspects of improving your health. Some are right on, and others are just a bit of hocus pocus. As with other concepts of medicine and healthcare, the major issue with these books is that they don\u2019t really address YOU as a whole being, as an individual, as an entity, as an integrated unit of many operating systems. And that integrated unit is influenced by many aspects including your birth family genetics, your medical history, your lifestyle, your diet, and the environment in which you live.\nMore than this, this book contains a protocol or a system that you can use to better your health and life. You might also realize that it includes a great deal of scientific information, which I have attempted to simplify, so you realize how science has played a huge role in proving that this protocol is science-based and will work for you. At any time that you feel the concepts being to complex to understand, just skip reading it, and move on to the next section and you can always go back and read the scientific research or evidence at a later time if you feel the need to do so.\nThe book was written in this way so that you could learn the protocol, and have the backup scientific data should you ever need to explain it to others.\nBalance is What We Seek\nWe all know that nature is about equilibrium. No matter what goes on the world, that impacts nature \u2013 nature will survive and regain its balance. That is not what happens with our human bodily systems, until we reach that point of living more in balance and harmony with the natural protocol in Functional Medicine.\nHomeostasis\nAs I said earlier, Nature is all about balance. Nature has been around for billions of years, and no matter what occurs on the surface of earth, hurricanes, tornados, volcanos, etc. Nature seeks out and finds ways, over time, to recreate a sense of balance.\nNow, wouldn\u2019t it be great if your body could react in the same way and over time it recreated that sense of balance, healthfulness, proper weight for your height and frame. Having your body do whatever you need it to do \u2013 whether it be an active family life with your children, or being an athlete performing at your best, or even living a fashionable life and be dressed to the T\u2019s, looking great at the parties you attend on your way up the corporate or social ladder. That would be a blessing.\nBalance is achievable. But, it takes some work to get started and have Functional Medicine work for you the way you want. So, let\u2019s get to work on it.\nThe Need For A New Medicine\nModern times, with its Agricultural, Industrial and Information Revolutions have brought great advances to our lifestyle and comfort. But it has also created the landscape for harmful effects on our health. Especially over the last 100 years we have seen a rapidly increasing ill effect on our health from the following:\nEnvironmental toxins from factories, automobiles and other sources contaminating the water supply, air and soil.\nRadiation from cell phones and cell phone towers, microwaves.\nSoil nutrient content deprivation.\nFood preparation techniques to improve preservation that destroy enzymes and nutrients.\nOveruse of steroids, antibiotics and hormone on livestock.\nOverprescribing of antibiotics for people, which has created\nsuper bugs and destroyed the normal healthy intestinal (bacterial) flora.\nOveruse of anti-depressants, attention deficit disorders, and other psych meds that are even finding their ways to water sources and the soil.\nPoly-pharmacy (the use of multiple prescription and over the-counter drugs).\nA more stressed society where the media is in constant\nAlert.\nA shorten attention span with people being less able to meditate and contemplate.\nIncreased addiction rates not only to chemicals but to technology.\nExcessive use of food preservatives, colorants and artificial sweeteners.\nLack of physical activities due to the availability of motorized transportation means and elevators.\nAll these factors have created a unique environment for many chronic\nmodern diseases to escalate. Diseases that were rare before are now a lot more common and new diseases are developing all the time.\nOver the last few years there has been a sharp increase in:\nCancers.\nAuto-immune diseases (like Lupus, MS, Arthritis, Grave\u2019s)\nDiabetes, Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome.\nCardio-vascular diseases (High Blood Pressure, Heart disease and Stroke).\nMental diseases like Depression, Anxiety, Addictions, Social Isolation.\nNeurological diseases (Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, Parkinson, ADD, Autism).\nChronic respiratory diseases like Asthma, COPD, Emphysema.\nAllergies, skin and respiratory.\nChronic or Persistent Infections (Viruses like HIV, CMV, EBV) (Bacterial like Rocky Mountain Fever)(Candida).\nHormone imbalances.\nDiseases that are difficult to classify like Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue, Non-specific Mental Fogginess\nSo, there is an obvious need for a different approach. The already be come- old approach of\npill medicine giving a medication for every symptom is not working anymore. This approach might be creating even more problems than solutions. Since we will discuss in this book, the solution we recommend is to address the actual root causes of the problem. Not the end-result complaint or symptoms but what is causing it. Not to look for an isolated\ntarget to go after but to look at the individual at its foundation. And to look at him or her as a whole, physical, mental and spiritual unity and try to recover that lost balance or homeostasis.\nA Word About Prevention\nThe recommendations and protocols presented in this book (and other books of this Series) apply not only to the amelioration or resolution of diseases already in place but to the prevention of those diseases as well. It is my experience on my clinical practice that when people apply these concepts and address health at the root cause, the onset of certain diseases (even when there is a genetic predisposition) can be delayed.\nEven if you have a strong family history of Diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, Heart disease or any other chronic disease, the development of that disease can be postponed and even aborted completely. This can only be accomplished when you modify the foundations of what causes the disease in the first place.\nEarly Screening does not prevent disease. It merely detects it at an early stage so it is easier to treat. The real benefit lyes on preventing or delaying the appearance of the disease, avoiding much suffering, disability and healthcare care expenses.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI want to express my sincerest thanks:\nTo my parents, for believing in me, no matter what the circumstances were in during my life. Please accept my thanks for all your support.\nTo my siblings, for supporting me, and sometimes literally doing so, so that I might continue to pursue my career while having food on the table.\nTo my daughter, Maia Sophia, who has brought a higher level of inspiration to my daily life.\nTo my wife, Luly, for her unconditional love and care when I was busy with my work and writing this book, when I should have been with her, relaxing and enjoying our lives together.\nTo Dr. Jay Polmar and Maria Krebs for improving the text and giving it structure.\nTo Maria Krebs and Cecilia Gonzalez Garcia for translating and editing the Spanish version.\nTo Lili Gonzalez Garcia and Martha Garcia Marquez for the design and layout of the various versions of this book.\nI want to thank and acknowledge all of you for helping create the homeostasis, and just the right balance of pressure and encouragement, to bring this work to fruition.\nA special Thanks to my Staff, past and present, who have always treated me and our patients, with so much respect and care: THANK YOU!!!\nHow to use this book in your daily life\nImagine that you are in a classroom, and you are studying human biology and this particular class is aimed at improving personal health, and living a life of being fit and healthy all the time.\nThat is how it is been designed and written to give you the scientific data and the \u2018straight facts\u2019 on how your body works and what you need to do to have your body work all the time, functioning perfectly for a long and healthy life.\nOnce you finish the course, there is a final exam. That final exam is putting the course into use and getting an A is based on your condition of healthfulness and being fit.\nWhen some of the scientific data is just too much to take, mark the pages you did not read inside the front cover, and when you feel it is time to study the most difficult concepts, go back and read or re-read them. The result of the course will be the same whether or not you understand the difficult concepts.\nINTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE\nAfter reviewing the History of Medicine, I\u2019d like to think that Functional Medicine is a\nreturning to the body of medical sciences. Medicine used to focus on body, mind and spirit as a whole, and especially on the interrelation of all elements or components, including the surrounding environment and its impact on health. It was like that for thousands of years.\nNow, during\nmodern times, health care has focused on pharmaceuticals and chemicals to treat specific complaints, or measurements (blood pressure, blood sugar just to mention a few) without looking at the individual, as a whole entity, with all our parts or components being intimately related and impacting each other.\nFunctional Medicine starts from the point that health becomes attainable when all the elements that make up the whole are in perfect harmony. The same complaint (headache, heartburn, fatigue, high blood pressure) may have been caused by a myriad of malfunctions throughout a chain of elements in the entire system. So, if you address only one of the areas (for example taking an anti-inflammatory pill for joint pain) without addressing the baseline issues (which might be a food sensitivity which causes an auto-immune complex formation that deposits on the joints, or a vitamin deficiency that needs supplementation for the natural auto- inflammatory enzyme reactions in the joints), this will not address the root causes. So, the treatment will only be temporary and usually will have side effects from the medications.\nComplaints and symptoms begin many years before they become obvious enough to become named as a\ndisease. Modern physicians have been effective in grouping those symptoms and naming diseases (i.e., Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s and many others), but they have not been effective in dealing with these complaints when they first begin, many years before symptoms turn into a\nfull blown disease. Functional Medicine tries to address the imbalances when they first occur. Many chronic diseases have common starting points (inflammation, oxidation, food sensitivities, immune dysregulation, etc.) that when addressed at onset can halt or delay the appearance of an end-stage disease. By concept, Functional Medicine is patient- based (individualized medicine) and not disease-based (when a diagnosis or disease becomes made and named, then all treatment is the same for all people thus affected).\nThe clinical thinking process of Functional Medicine is not conceptually different from that of modern Western medicine but it differs in its approach. It is still comprised of reviewing how the person got to the current point (Medical History), examining the body looking for clues (Physical Exam), investigating with laboratory and diagnostic tests (Diagnostics) and recommending actions to take to change the current and future health and wellbeing (Treatment or Therapeutics).\nMedical History:\nA Medical History is obtained, but it goes back predating conception, pregnancy, childhood and recent events, and how they all affect health. Most of the time when the initial insult is found (for example a major trauma) in the past, the current symptoms trace back to how that event affected the immune or hormonal systems. Any prior abuse of antibiotics (so prevalent today) can give a glimpse of the person\u2019s intestinal flora, which in turns determines gut permeability and ultimately the development of auto-immune diseases. This is most important for treatment decision-making, because an\nauto- immune disease like rheumatoid arthritis sometimes should not be treated with immune-modulators (which have major side effects), but with food elimination, probiotics and gut restoration (we will discuss this later in the book).\nPhysical Exam:\nMost patients complain that modern doctors do not\ntouch their patients anymore. Even though modern medicine was originally based on an exhaustive examination of the patient (and even tasting of their urine by the doctor), the most recent medical model has distanced the doctor from the patient\u2019s human body. Physical examination has become replaced by machines. A doctor trusts more in a CT scan than his stethoscope. Since Functional Medicine emphasizes prevention and early intervention, a comprehensive physical exam is mandatory. The functioning of the organs and systems cannot be detected by machines, only obvious anatomical changes can. The interconnection between all the bodily systems, the harmony of the body, with the mind and the spirit, can only become assessed by talking to and examining the patient.\nDiagnosis:\nEven though the taking of a thorough medical history and a physical exam might be all that\u2019s needed", "language": null, "image":
