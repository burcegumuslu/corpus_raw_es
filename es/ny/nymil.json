Ayurveda \u2013 the \u201cknowledge of life\u201d \u2013 has been practiced in India for thousands of years and is considered the oldest holistic health education in the world. Ayurvedic medicine is gaining in importance today \u2013 even in scientific circles. Because it is an ideal complement to conventional medicine, especially for symptoms or diseases that cannot be treated by conventional medicine alone.\nAyurveda looks a human as an image of the universe. Every living being and every plant unites five basic elements: fire, earth, water, air, ether. Based on these 5 elements, there are 3 doshas with which all physical functions can be described.\nis responsible for the metabolism.\nis responsible for the cohesion, resilience and structure of the body.\nis responsible for every kind of movement. It controls sense organs and mind.\nWhen symptoms of illness develop, Ayurveda sees it as an expression of the disturbance of harmony, that is, an imbalance of the 3 doshas, the basic life energies.\n\u201cThe focus of Ayurvedic contemplation is not a single symptom\nrather always the WHOLE Human \u2013 HIS BODY, HIS SPIRIT AND HIS SOUL.\u201d\nThe ayurvedic therapy has consequently the goal to restore the BALANCE, in the physical, mental and social surrounding and thus to activate the SELF-HEALTHCARE or IMMUNISATION of the organism. But not only in the case of illness, rather also as a PREVENTION AND RECREATION is an Ayurveda cure useful.\nBecause the focus is always on:\nIt is treated with gentle, natural methods that are intended to work in the long term to:\nAyurveda teaches a healthy lifestyle. Thus, in addition to the healing treatments to this holistic health doctrine include:\nCures are most beautiful on the southwest coast of India between November and March.\nHowever, the best time for an Ayurvedic cure is the monsoon time between April and July. Because when nature regenerates, the climate supports the purification of the body from inside and outside in an ideal way.\nPhone: 0049-9076-95 86 700\nAdress: Salzbrunnen 19\n89426 Wittislingen (Germany)\n[Send us a message!](/contact-us)", "language": null, "image": "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Devaaya-Ayurveda-2.jpg", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["#", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/ayurveda-resorts-india", "/tours/heritance-ayurveda-maha-gedara", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/about-ayurveda", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/ayurveda-packages", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/ayurveda-treatments", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/contact-us", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/about-ayurveda", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/az-ayurvedarol?lang=hu", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/%d0%be%d0%b1-%d0%b0%d1%8e%d1%80%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b5?lang=ru", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/sobre-ayurveda?lang=es", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com", "tel:+49 9076 95 86 700 / ES: +34 695 76 14 81 / RU: +7 777 210 8229", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/ayurveda-resorts-india", "/tours/heritance-ayurveda-maha-gedara", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/about-ayurveda", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/ayurveda-packages", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/ayurveda-treatments", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/contact-us", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/about-ayurveda", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/az-ayurvedarol?lang=hu", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/%d0%be%d0%b1-%d0%b0%d1%8e%d1%80%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b5?lang=ru", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com/sobre-ayurveda?lang=es", "https://ayurvedaescapes.com", "/ayurveda-packages", "/ayurveda-treatments", "#", "/contact-us", "/imprint", "/privacy-policy", "/disclaimer", "/terms-and-conditions", "/contact-us", "#", "//twitter.com/#", "//flickr.com/people/#", "//youtube.com/channel/#", "//vimeo.com/#", "#", "//pinterest.com/#", "//instagram.com/#"]}
