We  aimed  to  determine  the  preva-\nlence of  human  hookworm  species  by  combining  the  results  of  both  microscopy  and  PCR  among\nendemic populations  in  Argentina,  represented  by  natives  and  immigrants.  A  total  of  140  serial\nfecal specimens were  obtained  from  natives  in  the  province  of  Misiones  and  an  immigrant\ncommunity living in the  province  of  Buenos  Aires.  Samples  were  examined  using  the  formalin-\nethyl acetate concentration technique  (FECT)  and  one  \ufb02otation  technique  (screening  tests)\nand speci\ufb01c  PCRs  for  N.  americanus  and  A.  duodenale .  We  characterized  samples  containing\nN. americanus  by  sequencing  a  fragment  of  the  cytochrome  b  gene.  The  observed  hookworm\nprevalence as  assessed  by  the  screening  tests  and  PCR  were  24.3%  and  32.8%,  respectively.  PCR\npositive samples were  identi\ufb01ed  as  N.  americanus .  PCR  had  100%  sensitivity  compared  with\n73.9% of  screening  tests.  A  total  of  12  samples  from  individuals  with  hookworm-infected  house-\nhold members  were  positive  only  by  PCR.  N.  americanus  sequences  showed  90.5%  identity,  being\nmore similar  to  each  other  than  to  any  of  the  sequences  obtained  from  GenBank.  This  is  the\n\ufb01rst study  that  provides  molecular  data  and  characterization  of  N.  americanus  in  Argentina.\nThe complementary  use  of  FECT  and  one  \ufb02otation  technique  to  screen  hookworm  infections,\nfollowed by  PCR  to  differentiate  the  species  contribute  to  produce  better  prevalence  estimates.\n\u00a9 2022  Asociaci \u00b4on  Argentina  de  Microbiolog \u00b4\u0131a.

Globally,  hookworm  infections  tend  to  be  more\nprevalent in  rural  areas,  in  the  tropics  and  subtropics,  where\nfavorable environmental  conditions,  such  as  temperature,\nsoil moisture  and  soil  type,  converge  with  poverty  and  inad-\nequate sanitary  infrastructures30,43.\nThis infection  is  classically  caused  by  Necator  ameri-\ncanus and  Ancylostoma  duodenale ;  however ,  newer  studies\nhave shown  that  A.  ceylanicum ,  a  helminth  of  canids  and\nfelids, is  also  an  important  emerging  parasite  infecting\nhumans in  Southeast  Asia38,48,49,68.  N.  americanus  accounts\nfor the  majority  of  human  hookworm  cases  worldwide,\nbeing A.  duodenale  more  focally  endemic  in  the  Mediter-\nranean region, in  northern  regions  of  India,  China  and  North\nAfrica.43\nHookworm species not only  differ  in  their  morphology,\nbut also in  their  pathogenesis,  life  cycle,  and  clinical  fea-\ntures. Although  the  treatment  is  similar  for  both  hookworm\nspecies, the  severity  of  anemia  differs  depending  on  the\nspecies and  the  worm  load  in  the  intestine.  Actually,  exper-\nimental studies  have  shown  that  A.  duodenale  caused  2- - -10\ntimes more  blood  loss  per  worm  than  N.  americanus35.\nFurthermore, A.  duodenale  has  the  ability  to  infect  orally\nand remains  arrested  in  human  tissues75.  Therefore,  thespeci\ufb01c  identi\ufb01cation  of  these  species  is  an  important  public\nhealth measure  for  monitoring  the  severity  of  illnesses  and\nthe ef\ufb01cacy  of  mass  and  effective  treatment63.\nSeveral methods  are  available  to  determine  the  presence\nand intensity  of  hookworm  infections,  such  as  conven-\ntional techniques  based  on  egg  visualization,  which  are\nunable to  differentiate  between  species  (e.g.  formalin-\nether concentration  and  Kato- - -Katz),  coproculture  methods\n(e.g. Corticelli-Lai  and  Harada  Mori)  and  PCR-based  meth-\nods, which  have  already  proven  to  be  more  effective  for\nthe detection  of  hookworm  infection  than  conventional\ndiagnosis12.\nIn a  routine  laboratory  diagnosis  or  in  large-scale  preva-\nlence screenings,  the  choice  between  any  of  these  methods\ndepends on  many  factors,  such  as  the  relative  costs  of  the\ntechniques, the  methods  for  sample  preservation  and  the\nsimplicity to  carry  out  diagnostic  tests.\nAlthough several  studies  have  reported  molecular-based\nmethods to  study  the  prevalence  and  species  identity  of\nhuman hookworm  infections  in  endemic  countries  from  Asia\nand Africa4,48,58,61,  there  are  very  few  prevalence  studies\nwhich apply these techniques in  human  populations  from\nSouth American countries25,33,45,62.\nArgentina belongs  to  the  southernmost  region  of  Amer-\nica, and  is  characterized  by  high  variability  of  its  climatic\nand socioeconomic  conditions.  In  this  country,  the  frequency\nof intestinal  parasites  shows  a  declining  trend  from  north\nto south  and  from  east  to  west47.  With  regard  to  human\n269A.  Servi\u00e1n,  S.A.

Distribution of  human  hookworm  infections  reported  for  Argentinian  provinces  and  other  South  American  countries\nwas also indicated,  showing  the  mean  prevalence  value  for  each  geographic  area.  Adapted  from  7,  11,  17,  29,  33,  37,  47.  This  map\nwas created using QGIS  3.4.14  Madeira  (version  3.4.14  Madeira),  s.  f.  https://www.qgis.org/en/site/ .\nhookworms, the  infection  was  mainly  recorded  in  the  north\nof Argentina,  being  most  prevalent  in  the  provinces  of  Salta\nand Misiones  (Fig.  1)9,12,78.  In  the  province  of  Misiones,  the\nphysical environment  favors  the  high  prevalence  of  theseparasites.  Actually,  Rivero  et  al.55have  shown  that  hook-\nworms were  the  main  pathogens  detected  in  environmental\nsamples studied  in  this  province.  Moreover ,  Cociancic  et  al.15\nhave  found  that  most  individuals  infected  by  hookworms\n270Revista  Argentina  de  Microbiolog\u00eda  54  (2022)  268- - -281\nlived  in  areas  with  abundant  arboreal-shrubby  vegetation.\nOn the  other  hand,  in  non-endemic  areas  of  Argentina,  such\nas Buenos Aires,  there  are  no  updated  studies  reporting\nhookworm infections and the previous ones  described  only\nsporadic  cases10,23,70.  The  province  of  Buenos  Aires,  located\nin the  center  of  Argentina,  is  characterized  by  temperate\nclimate and  the  soil  has  a  silty- - -loam  texture  with  abundant\norganic matter.  These  climatic  and  environmental  condi-\ntions are  unfavorable  for  the  hookworm  life  cycle.  However ,\nthe high  degree  of  immigrant  people  from  endemic  areas\n(mainly from  Paraguay)  living  in  the  province  of  Buenos  Aires\nmakes it an  important  region  to  be  studied42,44.\nTo date,  most studies about  hookworm  infections  in\nArgentina were conducted using  microscopy-based  diagno-\nsis, while  few  reports  have  differentiated  between  species\nbased on  coproculture6,19,77and  only  one  was  based  on\nmolecular analysis12.  The  single  molecular  study  that  dif-\nferentiates hookworm species  was  performed  in  Salta  and\nfound that N. americanus (36.4%)  was  more  prevalent  than\nA. duodenale (19.1%)12.\nThe knowledge of the distribution  of  these  parasites,\nboth in endemic and non-endemic  regions,  is  important  to\nbetter understand the epidemiology  and  the  clinical  course\nof the infection of each  parasite  in  each  geographic  area.\nThis information would help to  make  a  better  diagnosis  of\npatients and design control programs based  on  the  charac-\nteristics of each region. To ful\ufb01ll  these  goals,  it  is  necessary\nto  implement an improved diagnostic strategy in  cross-\nsectional  surveys. Furthermore, we aimed to  determine\nthe prevalence  of  human  hookworm  species  by  combining\nresults of  microscopy  and  PCR  in  human  fecal  samples  from\nendemic populations  in  Argentina,  represented  by  natives\nand immigrants.  Moreover ,  we  aimed  to  provide  a  molecular\ncharacterization of  identi\ufb01ed  hookworm  species  in  order  to\nevaluate their  genetic  diversity  and  phylogenetic  relation-\nships, which  will  provide  a  basis  to  better  understand  the\nbiology of  these  parasites.\nMaterials  and  methods\nStudy  area  and  subject  sampling\nHuman  fecal  samples  were  collected  from  populations  from\ntwo provinces  in  Argentina,  representing  two  different\necoregions: the Province  of  Buenos  Aires,  located  in  the\nPampas ecoregion  and  the  Province  of  Misiones,  located  in\nthe Paran\u00e1 Atlantic  Forest.  All  samples  were  obtained  as\npart of a  larger  cross-sectional  survey  on  intestinal  para-\nsitic infections,  nutritional  status,  and  socio-environmental\nconditions in  human  populations.  In  the  Province  of  Buenos\nAires, 34  fecal  samples  were  collected  from  immigrants\nfrom Paraguay,  aged  1- - -60  years  old,  who  had  resided  in\nperipheral regions  of  the  district  of  La  Plata  (34\u25e655/prime17.22/prime/primeS\n57\u25e657/prime16.31/prime/primeW)  for  a  period  of  residence  ranging  from  6\nmonths to  22  years,  being  8  years  the  average  period.  In  the\nProvince of  Misiones,  106  samples  were  collected  from  indi-\nviduals, aged  1- - -40  years  old,  from  rural  areas  in  neighboring\nvillages in  the  locality  of  Arist\u00f3bulo  Del  Valle  (27\u25e605/prime43/prime/primeS\n54\u25e653/prime49/prime/primeW)  (Fig.  1).  Individuals  who  had  decided  to  par-\nticipate voluntarily  and  had  given  written  and  oral  consent\nwere included.  Children  or  youths  were  included  after  theirparents  and  legal  guardians  had  given  written  and  oral  con-\nsent. However ,  those  individuals  who  had  received  some\nantiparasitic treatment  by  the  time  of  the  research  were\nexcluded.\nThe area of  study  in  Buenos  Aires  is  a  non-endemic  region\nfor hookworms,  characterized  by  a  temperate  climate  and\npoor structural  and  socio-environmental  conditions.  The\narea is  inhabited  by  immigrants  from  Paraguay,  a  hookworm\nendemic country.  Most  of  the  individuals  came  from  low-\nincome families  with  parents  having  unskilled  or  informal\njobs.\nThe rural  areas  studied  in  the  Province  of  Misiones  are\ncharacterized by favorable conditions  for  the  persistence\nof human  hookworm  infection, such as  humid  climate  and\nsandy soils  with  abundant  arboreal-shrubby  vegetation.  Most\nof the  individuals  are  tenant  farmers  who  work  on  small-\nscale farming,  and  others  belong  to  indigenous  groups,  who\nhave their  homes  in  open  clearings  in  the  jungle.\nSample collection\nAfter  consent  was  obtained,  each  individual  was  supplied\na sterile  plastic  vial  containing  70%  ethanol.  Each  partici-\npant was  instructed  to  collect  a  nut-sized  stool  sample  each\nday, during  3 --- 5  days,  in  the  vials.  When  participants  were\nchildren, samples  were  collected  by  their  parents  or  legal\nguardians.\nFecal samples  were  submitted  to  Centro  de  Estudios  Para-\nsitol\u00f3gicos y  de  Vectores  (La  Plata,  Buenos  Aires,  Argentina)\nfrom April  2018  to  October  2019.  During  this  period,  the  pro-\ncedure included  microscopic  examination  (screening  tests)\nand molecular  analyses  (PCR)  of  human  fecal  samples  to\ndiagnose hookworm  species.\nParasitological  diagnosis\nScreening tests\nThe microscopic  examinations  performed  after  the  formalin-\nethyl acetate  concentration  technique  (FECT)  and  the\n\ufb02otation technique  were  considered  screening  tests,  which\npermitted the  identi\ufb01cation  of  hookworm  eggs.\nFecal samples preserved  in  70%  ethanol  were  processed\nby the  above  techniques,  followed  by  microscopic  exami-\nnation of  hookworms  and  other  intestinal  parasites.  First,\neach sample  was  \ufb01ltered  through  a  double  layer  of  gauze\nto remove  the  ethanol  solution  and  5%  formalin  was  added\nuntil it  covered  the  entire  sample.  Then,  samples  were  pro-\ncessed according  to  Cociancic  et  al.14and  WHO74.  Brie\ufb02y,\nfor the  FECT  method,  10  ml  of  formalin  fecal  suspension\nwas \ufb01ltered  and  centrifuged  at  1500  rpm  for  5  min.  Then,\n7 ml  of  formalin  and  3  ml  of  ethyl  acetate  were  added  to\nthe sediment,  mixed  and  centrifuged  at  1500  rpm  for  5  min.\nA saturated  sodium  chloride  solution  (S.  G.  =  1.2  g/ml)  was\nused for  the  Willis  \ufb02otation  technique.  Additionally,  the  anal\nswab method,  performed  according  to  Cociancic  et  al.14,\nwas used  for  the  speci\ufb01c  detection  of  Enterobius  vermicu-\nlaris as  part  of  the  general  parasitological  analysis  of  the\npopulation studied.\n271A.  Servi\u00e1n,  S.A.  Repetto,  M.  Lorena  Zonta  et  al.\nHookworm  L3  larvae\nIn  order  to  determine  PCR  sensitivity,  \ufb01lariform  larvae  (L3)\nwere isolated  from  fresh  fecal  samples.  These  samples  were\nobtained from  three  volunteers,  who  were  not  part  of  the\nsampling performed  as  object  of  this  study,  with  a  positive\nparasitological test  for  hookworm  eggs.  For  this  purpose,  4  g\nof fresh  fecal  samples  with  hookworm  eggs  were  cultured  at\n25\u25e6C- - -28\u25e6C  using  the  Harada  Mori  technique.  Cultures  were\nprepared in  a  thick  smear  to  individual  1-cm-wide  strips  of\n\ufb01lter paper  and  placed into open  15  ml  conical  tubes.  Ster-\nile water was added  to  the bottom of  each  tube  so  that  the\nmeniscus was about  0.5  cm below the fecal mass.  The  vol-\nume of  liquid  in  each  tube  was  monitored  daily  and  adjusted\nas needed,  and  larvae  were  collected  from  the  bottom  of  the\ntubes on  day  763.  The  morphological  differentiation  of  the\nL3s of  N.  americanus  from  those  of  A.  duodenale  was  based\non the  following  criteria:  measuring  the  total  length  of  the\nsheath; measuring  the  total  length  of  the  larva;  examining\nthe buccal  cavity  for  the  presence  of  a  visible  spear;  exam-\nining the  shape  of  the  larval  tail  and  measuring  the  larval  tail\nfrom the  anus  to  the  tip  of  the  tail  and  establishing  whether\nthe cuticular  striation  was  faint  or  strong2.  All  larvae  were\nidenti\ufb01ed as  N.  americanus .\nMolecular  analysis\nDNA isolation from  fecal  samples\nPrior to  extraction,  500  mg  of  fecal/ethanol  suspension  was\ncentrifuged at  8000  \u00d7  g,  and  the  pellet  was  washed  three\ntimes with  1  ml  of  sterilized  saline  buffer.  After  centrifu-\ngation, the  pellet  was  subjected  to  mechanical  disruption\nby 3 freeze- - -thaw cycles.

The  N.\namericanus -speci\ufb01c primers  were  designed  based  on\nreference sequences  of  the  cytochrome  b  (cob)  gene\navailable in  GenBank  (Acc.  Nos.  NC  003416,  AJ556134,\nNW 013561619);  and  A.  duodenale -speci\ufb01c  primers  were\ndesigned based  on  reference  sequences  of  the  ITS1\nrRNA region  available  in  GenBank  (Acc.  Nos.

The  consen-\nsus sequences were  compared  to  the  previously  published\nsequences of hookworm by using  the  Basic  Local  Alignment\nSearch Tool (BLAST) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast ).\nInternal PCR control\nIn  each  fecal  sample,  axenic  culture  epimastigotes  (1  \u00d7  104)\nfrom the  protozoa  T rypanosoma  cruzi ,  was  added  before\nDNA isolation  to  act  as  an  internal  control.

Indi-\nviduals without  parasite  species  were  included  as  negative\ncontrols.\nPhylogenetic  analysis\nPhylogenetic  analysis  was  carried  out  using  newly\nobtained hookworm  sequences  and  matching  sequences\nof other  representatives  of  hookworm  species  available  in\n272Revista  Argentina  de  Microbiolog\u00eda  54  (2022)  268- - -281\nGenBank.  Furthermore,  the  available  GenBank  sequence\nof the  strongylid  nematode  Oesophagostomum  dentatum\nwas used as  an  outgroup  (supplementary  table  S1).  DNA\nsequence data was aligned using the  CLUSTALW  program32,\nwith  default  options  for  introducing  gaps  into  the  align-\nment. When  needed,  inconsistencies  were  checked  and\nmanually edited.  Phylogenetic  relationships  were  inferred\nby Maximum  Likelihood  (ML)  using  MEGA  X  software41and\nthe Bayesian  inference  (BI)  as  implemented  in  MrBayes\nVer. 3.2.6  software57.  The  best  DNA  substitution  model\n(HKY +  G  +  I)  was  estimated  using  the  jModelTest  program50.\nNodal support for  the  ML  analysis  was  estimated  by  per-\nforming 1000  bootstrap  replications. The BI  analysis  was\nperformed using Markov chain  Monte  Carlo (MCMC) chains\nfor  1  000  000  generations  with  sample  frequency  set  at\n100. The  \ufb01rst  25%  of  the  trees  sampled  were  discarded\nas \u2018burn-in\u2019.  This  number  of  generations  was  considered\nsuf\ufb01cient because the  SD  dropped  below  0.01.\nA pairwise distance matrix among  the  hookworm\nsequences was calculated using  the  nucleotide  p-distance\nalgorithm implemented in MegaX41.\nStatistical analyses\nPrevalence was estimated with  95%  con\ufb01dence  intervals.  A\nsample was considered positive  if  it  was  positive  by  any\ntechnique, and was considered negative  if  all  diagnostic\ntechniques were negative.\nIn order to compare the performance  of  the  diagnos-\ntic tests, a minimum sample  size  of  125  individuals  was\ncalculated assuming a prevalence of  about  80%  based  on\nprevious  surveys  conducted  in  populations  from  the  same\nregions here  studied42,47,65.  The  combined  results  of  the\ntechniques employed  served  as  the  gold  standard27.  Sensi-\ntivity and  negative  predictive  value  (NPV)  of  the  techniques\nwere calculated  using  R  software  version  3.6.3  (R  Core  Team\n2020) through  library  bdpv60.  These  values  were  given  with\ntheir 95%  con\ufb01dence  intervals.  Complementary  evaluation\nwas conducted  using  Cohen\u2019s  kappa  test  for  two  categorical\nvariables under  the  interpretation  of  values  from  Watson\nand Petrie71and  according  to  the  criteria  of  Fleiss  et  al.22\nthrough  library  irr24.  This  test  was  performed  to  determine\nthe statistical  concordance  between  the  techniques  per-\nformed.\nSequences obtained  were  deposited  at  GenBank\nunder accession  numbers  MT757751- - -MT757759  and\nMW711817- - -MW711819.\nResults\nPrevalence  and  parasitological  screening\nA  total  of  140  fecal  samples  from  individuals  from  the\nprovinces of  Buenos  Aires  and  Misiones  were  subjected  to\nthe initial  screening  tests  for  hookworm  infection  consist-\ning of  microscopic  examination.  Screening  tests  detected  34\nout of  140  (24.3%)  samples  positive  for  hookworm  eggs  (30\nsamples were  detected  positive  by  FECT  and  22  samples  by\n\ufb02otation techniques).  The  highest  proportion  of  hookworm\ninfection corresponded  to  individuals  from  the  Province  ofMisiones  (31/34;  91.2%),  and  only  three  samples  (3/34;  8.8%)\nwere positive  in  Buenos  Aires  (Table  1).\nThe prevalence  of  hookworm  based  on  FECT  was  21.42%\nCI [15.13%- - -29.14%] in  the  total  population  analyzed,  25.47%\nCI [17.64%- - -34.77%] in  Misiones  and  8.82%  CI  [2.45%- - -22.87%]\nin Buenos  Aires.  On  the  other  hand,  the  prevalence  based\non \ufb02otation  technique  was  15.71%  CI  [10.33%- - -22.69]  in  the\ntotal population  analyzed,  18.86%  CI  [11.96%- - -27.41%]  in\nMisiones and  5.88%  CI  [1.05%- - -18.83%]  in  Buenos  Aires.\nGlobally, the  prevalence  of  hookworm  calculated  based\non screening  test  results  was  24.28%  CI  [17.65%- - -32.04%]  in\nthe total  population  analyzed,  29.24%  CI  [20.97%- - -38.59%]  in\nMisiones and 8.82% CI  [2.45%- - -22.87%]  in  Buenos  Aires.\nThe overall  prevalence  of parasites was  76.5%  in  Buenos\nAires and  77.3%  in  Misiones,  being  Blastocystis  sp.  and  E.\nvermicularis the  most  prevalent  parasites  in  both  provinces\n(supplementary table  S2).\nValidation  of  PCR  approach\nThe PCR  for  the  ampli\ufb01cation  of  hookworm  DNA  from  feces\nwas established  using  positive  control  DNA  samples.\nWhen primers  Ancy/AncyF  were  tested,  a  fragment  of\napproximately 71  bp  could  be  ampli\ufb01ed  from  DNA  samples\nknown to  contain  A.  duodenale .  Similarly,  when  primers\nNecF/NecR were  tested,  amplicons  of  172  bp  were  obtained\n(supplementary Fig.  S3).\nThe analytical  speci\ufb01city  of  N.  americanus  and  A.\nduodenale PCR  was  evaluated  with  DNA  samples  from\npatients with  related  nematodes  or  other  pathogens,  and\nno cross-reactions  were  observed  (supplementary  Fig.  S3).\nN. americanus larvae  obtained  by  coproculture  were  used\nto test this speci\ufb01c-PCR.\nAnalytical  sensitivity\nAnalytical  sensitivity  of  PCR  was  tested  with  different  counts\nof N.  americanus  larvae  (1  L3,  30  L3,  50  L3  and  100  L3).  All\nthese samples  showed  ampli\ufb01cation,  except  the  one  with  a\nsingle \ufb01lariform  larva  L3  (supplementary  Fig.  S3).\nDifferential  diagnosis  by  PCR\nBased  on  the  results  from  the  validation,  all  the  fecal  sam-\nples (n  =  140)  were  subjected  to  PCR  for  the  differential\ndiagnosis of  A.  duodenale  and  N.  americanus ,  using  the\napproach described  herein.\nThirty-four out  of  34  (100%)  hookworm  egg-positive  sam-\nples were  successfully  ampli\ufb01ed.  In  addition,  12  samples\nthat were  found  to  be  negative  by  microscopy  were  found  to\nbe positive  only  by  PCR.  All  these  samples  corresponded  to\nindividuals with  at  least  one  hookworm-positive  family  mem-\nber. These  results  were  validated  by  sequencing,  obtaining\nthe corresponding  12  sequences  successfully.\nAll PCR-positive  samples  (n  =  46)  corresponded  to  N.\namericanus .\nThe prevalence  of  hookworm,  calculated  based  on  PCR\nassays, was  32.85%  [25.18%- - -41.02]  in  the  total  population\nanalyzed, 38.67%  CI  [29.53%- - -48.58%]  in  Misiones  and  14.70%\nCI [5.97%- - -30.39%]  in  Buenos  Aires.\n273A.

When  FECT  and  \ufb02otation  were  consid-\nered together  as  screening  tests,  sensitivity  was  73.91%.\nIn addition,  the  higher  value  of  NPV  was  for  PCR  (100%  CI\n[(99.46%- - -100.00%]) (Table  2).\nCohen\u2019s kappa  index  showed  good  agreement  between\nthe employed  techniques,  being  moderate  between  PCR  and\n\ufb02otation (0.54  CI  [0.39- - -0.68]),  and  substantial  between  PCR\nand FECT  (0.70  CI  [0.54- - -0.86]).  When  FECT  and  \ufb02otation\nwere considered  together ,  substantial  agreement  was  found\nwith PCR  (0.78  CI  [0.61- - -0.94])  (Table  3).  Fleiss\u2019  Kappa  index\nwas calculated  among  PCR,  \ufb02otation  and  FECT  techniques,\nand was  0.617.\nBased on  combined  microscopy  plus  the  PCR  detec-\ntion approach,  a  prevalence  of  32.85%  [25.18%- - -41.02]  was\ndetected for  N.  americanus  in  the  total  population  ana-\nlyzed, 38.67%  CI  [29.53%- - -48.58%]  in  Misiones  and  14.70%  CI\n[5.97%- - -30.39%] in  Buenos  Aires.  Most  of  the  infected  individ-\nuals in Buenos Aires  were  20- - -45-year-old  adults  (4/5;  75%),\nwhile most  of  the  infected  ones  in  Misiones  were  1- - -15-year-\nold children (40/41;  97.6%).\nMolecular  and  phylogenetic  analysis\nA  total  of  12  cob  sequences  of  169  bp  were  successfully\nobtained from  N.  americanus .  The  BLAST  similarity  analy-\nsis con\ufb01rmed  that  the  correct  regions  had  been  ampli\ufb01ed.\nAll the  sequences  obtained  aligned  closest  to  N.  americanus\nfrom China  (GenBank  accession  number  AJ417719)  (96- - -99%\nidentity). Sequences  were  90.5%  (153/169)  identical,  show-\ning 16  polymorphic  sites,  ten  of  which  corresponded  to\nsingleton variable  sites  with  two  variants,  and  six  to  par-\nsimony informative  sites  with  two  variants.\nPairwise DNA  analyses  revealed  that  the  divergence\namong newly  obtained  sequences  of  N.  americanus  rangedfrom  0  to  6.5%  (0- - -11  nucleotides).  Three  isolates  from  the\nProvince of  Misiones  (Acc.  Nos.  MT757754,  MT757756  and\nMT757758) were  completely  identical.  This  analysis  also\nshowed that  the  genetic  distance  of  the  cob  gene  among  N.\namericanus sequences  included  in  this  study  ranged  from  0\nto 10.6%  (0- - -18  nucleotides).  The  sequence  of  N.  americanus\nfrom Africa  (AJ556134)  showed  higher  values  of  genetic  dis-\ntance, ranging  from  7.1%  to  10.6%,  when  it  was  compared\nwith each  one  of  the  remaining  sequences  analyzed  (Fig.  2).\nWhen the  ML  and  BI  analyses  were  performed,  almost\nidentical tree  topologies  were  obtained.  However ,  there\nwere differences  in  the  resolution  of  clades  which  included\nthe newly  obtained  sequences  (Fig.  3).\nAll N.  americanus  sequences  clustered  together  in  a\nmonophyletic clade,  named  N.  americanus  group,  highly\nsupported by  both  the  ML  and  BI  methods  (90%  and  92%,\nrespectively). In this group,  the  newly  obtained  sequences\nclustered altogether (clade A), separately  from  the  isolates\nfrom China and  Africa  (Fig.  3).\nThe Ancylostoma sequences also  formed  a  monophyletic\nclade, named Ancylostoma spp. group, and  represented  a\nsister clade of N. americanus  group.  Within  Ancylostoma\nspp. group, sequences of A. caninum  and  A.  ceylanicum ,\nboth isolated from dogs, clustered together and  separately\nfrom A.  duodenale  sequences  isolated  from  humans  (Fig.  3).\nTaken together ,  N.  americanus  and  Ancylostom a  spp.\nsequences clustered  as  a  major  clade  (Ancylotomatidae\ngroup).\nDiscussion\nThe  etiologic  agent  of  hookworm  infection  has  often  been\nunknown because  the  differentiation  between  species  is\nnot usually  performed  in  the  diagnostic  laboratory,  partic-\nularly in  resource-limited  countries  such  as  Argentina12,30.\nAlthough differential  diagnosis  contributes  to  a  further  com-\nprehension of  the  dynamics  of  infection,  hookworm  species\nhave been  considered  to  be  identical  for  treatment  and  con-\ntrol strategies13.  Actually,  both  species  can  cause  anemia,\nbut clinical  studies  have  indicated  a  stronger  association  of\nA. duodenale  infection  with  anemia  than  N.  americanus35,64.\nMoreover , unlike  N.  americanus ,  A.  duodenale  can  be  orally\ningested, and  potentially  result  in  Wakana  syndrome  (nau-\nsea, vomiting,  pharyngeal  irritation,  cough  and  dyspnea)72.\nMore sensitive  diagnostic  tools  are  essential  for  an  accu-\nrate assessment  of  parasitic  infections  in  low-endemicity\n274Revista  Argentina  de  Microbiolog\u00eda  54  (2022)  268- - -281\nT able 2  Sensitivity  and  negative  predictive  values  (NPV)  of  the  formalin-ethyl  acetate  concentration  technique  (FECT),  \ufb02otation\nand PCR  for  N.  americanus  detection.\nTechnique Sensitivity%  (95%  CI)  NPV%  (95%  CI)\nFECT 65.21  (49.75- - -78.74) 84.97  (79.34- - -88.98)\nFlotation 46.82  (32.88- - -63.05)  79.46  (74.65- - -83.43)\nScreening testsa73.91  (58.86- - -85.73)  88.02  (82.10- - -91.81)\nPCR 100.00  (92.29- - -100.00)  100  (99.46- - -100.00)\naResults  considering  both  FECT  and  \ufb02otation  technique.\nT able  3  Results  of  Cohen\u2019s  Kappa  index  between  the  screening  tests  (FECT  and  Flotation)  and  PCR.\nTechniques PCR\nPositive Negative  Total  Cohen\u2019s  Kappa  index  (95%  CI)  S.E.

Moreover ,\ndesigning optimal  strategies  for  the  diagnosis,  which  takes\ninto account  ease  of  use,  test  performance,  and  costs,  is\nparticularly important  in  developing  countries.  Numerous\nPCR-based assays  have  been  developed  for  the  identi\ufb01ca-\ntion of  human  hookworm  species4,13,18,26,48,75.  However ,  the\ncurrent and  de\ufb01nitive  diagnosis  is  mainly  based  on  the  micro-\nscopic visualization  of  eggs  in  feces  and  the  Kato- - -Katz\nmethod is  the  recommended  technique  by  the  WHO  for  mon-\nitoring helminth  control  programs  because  of  its  simplicity\nand relatively  low  cost74.  Despite  this  latter  recommenda-\ntion, the  Kato- - -Katz  method  has  low  sensitivity;  particularly\nif only  a  single  stool  sample  is  examined  in  areas  characte-\nrized by  low-intensity  infections,  and  can  only  be  performed\non fresh  fecal  samples16,40.\nIn Argentina, very  few  studies  have  reported  the  differen-\ntial diagnosis  of  hookworm  species;  one  study  has  performed\nmolecular techniques12while  most  have  carried  out  copro-\nculture as a means  of  species  identi\ufb01cation6,12,19,77.\nIn this work, we proposed  to  determine  the  prevalence\nof  hookworm  species  by  morphological  and  molecular  tech-\nniques, as  a  strategic  way  to  study  endemic  populations  for\nthese parasites  represented  by  natives  and  immigrants  in\nArgentina.\nMorphological techniques  (sedimentation  and  \ufb02otation\nmethods) were  selected  as  screening  tests  for  hookworm\ninfection because  they  are  standard  methods  for  gastroin-\ntestinal parasites;  they  are  technically  simple  and  low-cost\ntechniques58.  These  methods  allowed  us  to  detect  73.9%\n(34/46) of the  total  hookworm-positive  samples  in  the  pop-\nulations studied. In  parallel,  the  PCR  assay  detected  100%(46/46) of  the  positive  cases.  This  method  provided  12\nadditional positive  results  in  addition  to  those  detected\nusing the  screening  tests.  These  cases  corresponded  to  indi-\nviduals with  at  least  one  household  member  positive  for\nhookworms. With  regard  to  the  last  point,  many  authors  indi-\ncated that  the  predisposition  to  human  hookworm  infection\nis dependent  on  factors  acting  at  the  family  and  household\nlevel28,51,52,69.  Moreover ,  this  predisposition  is  higher  in  fami-\nlies whose  members  not  only  live  in  the  same  residence,  but\nalso share  the  same  genetic  factors.  Several  studies  have\nhighlighted that  these  factors  in\ufb02uence  susceptibility  to\nhookworm infections8,51.  The  combined  effect  of  household\nand genetic  factors  explains  much  better  the  predisposition\nto heavy  or  light  hookworm  infections52.  A  high  prevalence\nof intestinal  parasitic  infection  was  observed  among  house-\nhold contacts  of  primary  cases  in  cross-sectional  surveys,\nwhere hookworm  infection  was  the  predominant  parasitic\ninfection21.\nThe agreement  between  PCR  and  screening  tests  was\nmoderate to  substantial  and  the  NPV  was  higher  for  PCR.\nThis result shows  that  the  microscopy  analysis  and  the  PCR\nmethod evaluated here may be  used  as  complementary\ntools,  being  the  PCR  method  successful  to  detect  hookworms\nin microscopic  false-negative  samples  and  provide  species-\nspeci\ufb01c identi\ufb01cation.  The  results  of  the  comparison  among\ntechniques showed  good  agreement.\nIn this  study,  PCR  showed  higher  sensitivity  than  the\nscreening tests  (FECT  and  \ufb02otation)  and  detected  12  pos-\nitive samples  more  than  these  techniques.  Anamnart  et  al.1\npointed  out  that  the  formalin  solution  and  the  gauze  pore\nsize (employed  to  \ufb01lter  the  samples)  affected  the  recovery\n275A.  Servi\u00e1n,  S.A.

This  last  consideration  may  explain  the\nlow sensitivity  of  the  screening  tests,  in  comparison  with  the\nPCR to detect  hookworm  infections.\nBased on these results, we propose  a  diagnostic  strat-\negy  which  considers  the  simultaneous  use  of  FECT  and\n\ufb02otation techniques  in  parallel  to  perform  an  initial  screen-\ning test,  followed  by  a  PCR  assay  to  differentiate  the\nhookworm species.  PCR  may  be  performed  not  only  on\negg-positive samples  but  also  on  samples  from  individu-\nals who  tested  negative  by  microscopic  examinations  but\nwith hookworm-positive  household  members.  This  diagnos-\ntic strategy includes  the  preservation  of  a  series  of  fecal\nsamples in  70%  ethanol. This method  of  sample  collection\nallows to perform morphological  and  molecular techniques\nwithout the  need  to  ask  people  for  a  fresh  sample  to  con\ufb01rm\nthe diagnosis.  In  this  sense,  unpreserved  stool  samples  are\npreferred for  molecular  studies,  but  they  have  to  be  stored\nand transported frozen.  Although  ethanol  is  not  classi\ufb01ed  as\na parasitology \ufb01xative, mixing it  with  stool  samples  allows\ntransportation and storage at  room  temperature  for  at  least\n3 months67. Our  diagnostic  strategy  is  in  agreement  with\nthat of Knopp et  al.39,  who  recommended  the  examination\nof multiple stool samples  and  the  use  of  different  techniques\nfor the accurate diagnosis of  worms,  particularly  in  areas\nundergoing repeated antihelminthic drug administration.\nAll hookworm infections in this study  were  caused  by\nN. americanus and this result was consistent  with  previous\nworldwide  studies which highlight this parasite as  the  pre-\ndominant  human hookworm species43,45.  On  the  other  hand,\nA. duodenale  is  more  focally  endemic  in  India,  China,  Africa,\nand a  few  regions  of  the  Americas43.  With  respect  to  A.\nceylanicum , our  study  was  unable  to  detect  this  parasite.\nHowever , this  helminth  was  reported  as  the  second  most\nprevalent hookworm  species  infecting  humans  in  Asia,  and\nwas only  found  in  dogs  in  South  America  in  197634,49,53.\nIn Argentina,  the  few  studies  which  made  differential\ndiagnosis also  found  N.  americanus  as  a  prevalent  species.\nBorda et  al.6studied  the  prevalence  of  intestinal  parasitism\nin children  from  the  Province  of  Corrientes,  and  recorded  a\nprevalence of  12%  for  N.  americanus ,  1%  for  A.  duodenale\nand 4%  for  mixed  infections  using  coproculture  techniques.\nSimilarly, Cimino  et  al.12studied  human  intestinal  para-\nsites in  an  asymptomatic  population  from  the  Province  of\nSalta and  detected  a  prevalence  of  36.4%  for  N.  americanus\nand 19.1%  for  A.  duodenale .  Exceptionally,  Echaz\u00fa  et  al.19\nreported  that  A.  duodenale  accounted  for  86%  (63/73)  of\nthe hookworm  cases  identi\ufb01ed  by  species  in  a  study  about\ntreatment of soil-transmitted  helminths  in  the  Province  of\nSalta.\nSeveral studies  about  the  age-speci\ufb01c  epidemiology  of\nhookworm infection reported  that  although  children  are\ncommonly infected, the  prevalence  and  infection  intensity\nis highest  in  adults36,43.  In  this  study,  these  helminths  were\nfound in  both  children  and  adults.  In  Buenos  Aires,  adults\nwere the  most  infected.  They  were  probably  chronically  par-\nasitized individuals  who  acquired  the  infection  from  their\nnative countries,  in  this  case  Paraguay,  which  is  a  hookworm\nendemic area59.  In  this  regard,  these  parasites  can  reside\nfor many  years  in  the  small  intestine  of  their  hosts  and  it  is\nknown that  elderly  individuals  in  hookworm-endemic  areas\nharbor the  heaviest  burdens8,30.  On  the  other  hand,  chil-\ndren were  the  most  infected  in  Misiones.  In  general,  the  riskof  hookworm  infection  in  children  has  been  associated  with\nwearing shoes,  hand  wash  practice  and  personal  hygiene20.\nHence, children  from  Misiones  likely  got  infected  due  to\ntheir poorly developed  hygiene  habits  and  susceptibility  to\nenteric infections\nDespite the  high  prevalence  of  hookworms  recorded  in\nthe Province  of  Misiones  in  previous  studies23,46,56,78,  a  lower\nvalue (38.7%)  was  found  in  the  rural  area  studied.  In  accor-\ndance with  our  results,  Cociancic  et  al.15reported  a  low\nprevalence of  hookworm  infection  (16.0%)  in  Misiones.  This\ndecrease in  the  frequency  of  infection  may  be  due  to  the\nadministration of  preventive  chemotherapy  to  control  soil-\ntransmitted helminth infections in  children,  recommended\nby the  WHO73. To  date,  there  are  no  molecular  studies\navailable on  the  differential  diagnosis  of  hookworm  in  this\nprovince. Similarly,  there  are  scarce  and  no  current  stud-\nies that  report  hookworm  infections  in  Buenos  Aires37.  It\nis known  that  hookworms  are  dependent  on  environmen-\ntal factors, being the  soil  and  climate  conditions  of  Buenos\nAires less favorable  for  the  survival  of  hookworm  eggs.  How-\never , this study  was  focused  on  the  immigrant  population\nfrom Paraguay, with  an  average  of  8  years  of  residence\nin Buenos Aires,  taking  into  account  that  hookworm  infec-\ntion remains one of  the  most  common  chronic  infections  in\nhumans. In fact, it  was  estimated  that  A.  duodenale  can\nlive in the human intestine  on  average  from  1  to  3  years,\nand N. americanus from 3 to  10  years,  with  a  maximum\nlifespan of 18 years10.  In  this  regard,  Waks70also  investi-\ngated hookworm infection in an  immigrant  population  who\nlived in overcrowded and  unsanitary  conditions  in  Buenos\nAires. In this study, it  was  found  that  4.7%  of  1218  subjects\nwere infected  with  N.  americanus.  Similarly,  we  also  found\na low  prevalence  of  hookworm  infection  (4.4%)  in  the  immi-\ngrant population  studied  from  La  Plata  city  in  Buenos  Aires.\nGamboa et  al.23also  reported  sporadic  cases  of  hookworm\ninfections in  suburban  areas  of  La  Plata  (3  out  of  the  312\nindividuals studied);  however ,  they  did  not  provide  informa-\ntion about  the  geographical  origin  of  the  population  under\nstudy. On  the  other  hand,  Castex  and  Greenway10reported\nfour human  cases  of  infections  caused  by  A.  duodenale  in\nthis province,  proposing  that  these  cases  were  indigenous\nbecause the  people  studied  had  no  history  of  residence  in\nendemic areas.\nThe samples  that  tested  positive  only  by  PCR  were\nsequenced and  subjected  to  phylogenetic  analysis.  This  last\nanalysis showed  that  all  the  sequences  of  N.  americanus\nincluded in  this  study  were  grouped  into  a  monophyletic\nclade. We  found  sixteen  different  nucleotides  when  all\nsequences generated  using  the  primers  designed  in  house\nwere compared,  and  a  maximum  of  11  nucleotides  when\nthe pairwise  analysis  was  performed.  In  this  sense,  when\nHu et  al.31compared  the  complete  sequence  of  the  cob\ngene between N.  americanus  from  Togo  with  another\nfrom China (1113 nucleotides),  6%  of  divergence  was\nfound. We obtained  slightly  homologous  ampli\ufb01cation\nproducts  within  the  cob  gene  and  likely  represent  poly-\nmorphisms in  the  sequence  among  isolates  from  Argentina.\nThese results  suggest  that  polymorphisms  may  occur  in\neven the  smallest  endemic  and  non-endemic  communi-\nties. As  a  consequence,  these  molecular  data  provide  a\nbasis for  further  studies  in  population  genetics  and  pos-\nsible functions  that  such  polymorphisms  may  have  on\n277A.  Servi\u00e1n,  S.A.  Repetto,  M.  Lorena  Zonta  et  al.\nspecies-speci\ufb01c  modes  of  disease  pathogenesis  and  resis-\ntance to  treatment.\nThese results show  that  it  is  important  to  include  sen-\nsitive diagnostic tools to contribute to  the  monitoring  of\nhookworm  prevalence.  Bergquist  et  al.5mentioned  that  a\ndiagnostic approach  useful  in  practice  is  almost  always  a\ncompromise between  quality  and  quantity  since  the  tech-\nniques needed  for  a  large-scale  application  must  be  based\non cost-effectiveness  (i.e.,  time  and  resources  required  per\ntest), precision,  simplicity  and  robustness.  In  that  regard,\nPCR-based methods  are  speci\ufb01c-sequence  directed  while\nmicroscopy remains an  important  diagnostic  tool  as  it  can\nidentify other  parasites  present in the  fecal  sample  for  which\nno PCR is available  and  thus, to perform  a  broader  intestinal\nparasite  diagnostic33.\nConclusion\nIn  conclusion,  in  the  present  study,  the  aim  was  to  gener-\nate better  hookworm  prevalence  estimates  by  performing\nboth microscopic  and  molecular  techniques  in  endemic  pop-\nulations residing  in  two  areas  with  different  susceptibility\nto hookworm  infections.  Although  the  province  of  Misiones\nis an  endemic  region  for  these  infections,  the  prevalence\nhas decreased in  comparison  with  previous  studies.  On  the\nother hand,  the  results  obtained  for  the  province  of  Buenos\nAires indicate  the  persistence  of  the  infection  in  immigrants\nfrom countries where  hookworms  are  highly  prevalent.  Con-\nsequently, we  highlight  the  importance  of  diagnosing  these\npopulations in  non-endemic  areas.  N.  americanus  was  the\nonly species detected  in  both  provinces.  The  higher  sen-\nsitivity of the PCR  allowed  to  identify  human  hookworm\nin samples testing negative  by  microscopic  examination.\nThis is the  \ufb01rst  study  that  contributes  to  the  record  of\nN. americanus in two  different  populations  from  different\ngeographic areas in Argentina based on  molecular  data.\nMoreover , sequences of the cob  gene  provided  for  Argen-\ntinian  isolates of N. americanus  contributed  to  the  scarce\nmolecular  information  about  this  parasite  in  these  regions.\nEthical  standards\nThe authors  assert  that  all  procedures  contributing  to  this\nwork comply  with  the  ethical  standards  of  the  relevant\nnational research  committee  (Comit\u00e9  Consultivo  de  Bio\u00e9tica\nde la Universidad  Nacional  de  La  Plata  100-20120/18)  and\ninstitutional committees  on  human  experimentation  and\nwith the Helsinki  Declaration  of  1975,  as  revised  in  2008.\nAll the participants  included  in  this  study  gave  consent  for\nthe scienti\ufb01c examination of  their  fecal  samples  and  to  have\ntheir parasitological  results  published.
