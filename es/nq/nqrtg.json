M\u00e1s bien, se debe alentar a las mujeres a recibir una nutrici\u00f3n adecuada, que se logra mejor a trav\u00e9s del consumo de una dieta sana y equilibrada. Sin embargo, las recomendaciones para el tratamiento de la xeroftalm\u00eda no est\u00e1n cubiertas en esta gu\u00eda (\n[QUIEN, 2011](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/44623/9789241501774_eng.pdf?sequence=1)).\nEl porcentaje de mujeres con un nacido vivo en los dos a\u00f1os anteriores que recibieron dosis altas de suplementos posparto (200,000 XNUMX UI por dosis) de vitamina A (palmitato de retinol) dentro de las ocho semanas para mujeres que amamantan o dentro de las seis semanas para mujeres que no amamantan.\nEste indicador se calcula como:\n(N\u00famero de mujeres que recibieron altas dosis de vitamina A posparto dentro de las 8 semanas (lactancia) o 6 semanas (no lactancia) del \u00faltimo nacido vivo / N\u00famero total de mujeres con un nacido vivo en los \u00faltimos 2 a\u00f1os) x 100\nRequerimientos de datos):\nEl n\u00famero total de nacimientos durante un per\u00edodo de referencia determinado y el n\u00famero de mujeres que reciben dos suplementos de vitamina A en dosis altas en seis u ocho semanas de parto dependiendo del estado de lactancia. Los evaluadores deben desglosar los hallazgos para mujeres lactantes y no lactantes (para garantizar que el programa llegue a ambos grupos), por grupos de edad, paridad y, cuando est\u00e9 disponible, por factores socioecon\u00f3micos y demogr\u00e1ficos relevantes, como educaci\u00f3n, ingresos y residencia urbana/rural. .\nEstad\u00edsticas del programa (fuente habitual); encuestas basadas en la poblaci\u00f3n (por ejemplo, DHS, UNICEF-MICS)\nLa suplementaci\u00f3n con dosis altas de vitamina A en el posparto temprano ayuda a reemplazar las reservas maternas utilizadas durante el embarazo y aumenta o mantiene la concentraci\u00f3n de vitamina A en la leche materna de mujeres lactantes con deficiencia de vitamina A (VAD). Con base en los niveles de retinol s\u00e9rico de 406 encuestas realizadas entre 1995 y 2005, la OMS (2009) estim\u00f3 que 19.1 millones de mujeres embarazadas (15.3 por ciento) en todo el mundo est\u00e1n en riesgo de VAD. Adem\u00e1s de contribuir a la mortalidad materna y otros malos resultados del embarazo y la lactancia, la VAD disminuye la capacidad del cuerpo para combatir infecciones y es un factor de riesgo de anemia. En sus formas m\u00e1s graves, la VAD puede provocar ceguera nocturna en ni\u00f1os y mujeres embarazadas y ceguera por secado progresivo, ulceraci\u00f3n y necrosis de la c\u00f3rnea. La principal causa subyacente de la VAD es una dieta cr\u00f3nicamente insuficiente en vitamina A y B-caroteno que puede conducir a reservas corporales reducidas y no satisfacer las necesidades fisiol\u00f3gicas b\u00e1sicas, como el apoyo al crecimiento de los tejidos, el metabolismo normal y la resistencia a las infecciones. Este indicador se puede utilizar como indicador indirecto de la cobertura y la calidad de la atenci\u00f3n posparto y se relaciona con tres de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio: #1. Reducir la pobreza y el hambre; #4. Disminuir la mortalidad infantil; y #5. Mejorar la salud materna.\nLas megadosis de vitamina A pueden da\u00f1ar potencialmente al feto, por lo tanto, las mujeres que podr\u00edan quedar embarazadas no deben recibir dosis altas de vitamina A. La OMS recomienda una dosis oral \u00fanica de 200,000 UI en el per\u00edodo posparto temprano para minimizar el riesgo de que una mujer se quede embarazada. embarazada. Los marcos de tiempo recomendados son antes de las 8 semanas para las mujeres que amamantan y antes de las 6 semanas para las mujeres que no amamantan (OMS, 2009). La dosis de 200,000 UI se considera suficiente para aumentar y mantener el contenido de vitamina A de la leche materna y compensar el efecto de agotamiento que la lactancia puede tener sobre las reservas de vitamina A de la madre. El Grupo Consultivo Internacional de Vitamina A (IVACG) informa sobre una serie de estudios que compararon la megadosis \u00fanica de vitamina A con una segunda dosis de 200,000 6 UI dentro del marco de tiempo recomendado y no se encontraron diferencias significativas a los 2004 meses para el retinol de la leche materna o la prevalencia de DAV (IVACG, XNUMX).\nUn indicador alternativo que refleja la idoneidad del programa para satisfacer las necesidades de clientes espec\u00edficos es el n\u00famero de c\u00e1psulas distribuidas por cliente elegible.\nUn problema potencial en el c\u00e1lculo de este indicador es que los clientes pueden dar a luz en un lugar diferente de donde reciben la suplementaci\u00f3n. Si el indicador se basa en una cifra general para un distrito, generalmente es m\u00e1s preciso que si se basara en los datos de cl\u00ednicas espec\u00edficas. De igual manera, es importante especificar si este indicador mide los complementos distribuidos a trav\u00e9s de los promotores a las madres que dan a luz en el hogar, o solo los que se entregan en los puntos de prestaci\u00f3n de servicios. Si se utilizan registros de clientes de establecimientos de salud o registros de distribuci\u00f3n basados en la comunidad, es posible que estos no sean consistentemente precisos.\nDebido a que ha habido diversas recomendaciones sobre el n\u00famero y el momento de las megadosis de vitamina A posparto, el recuerdo de las mujeres de su \u00faltimo nacido vivo en los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os puede estar sesgado por el r\u00e9gimen de dosificaci\u00f3n. Es m\u00e1s probable que las mujeres que recibieron dos megadosis lo recuerden que las que recibieron una.\nacceso, nutrici\u00f3n, reci\u00e9n nacido (NB), maternidad segura (SM)\nIVACG, 2004, La
