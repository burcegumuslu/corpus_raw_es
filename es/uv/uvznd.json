Each area and point on the legs reflects a particular organ and area in the body. The feet are a reflection of the body.\nSpecial presses and massages of these points, allow to treat and alleviate a variety of medical problems throughout the body through the feet only.\nReflexology stimulates blood circulation, improves the function of various body systems, brings balance and helps the natural healing power of the body and mind.\nThe word reflexology is divided into two:\nReflex Derived from the word Reflection in English which means reflection \u2013 symbolizes the reflection of the body as well as the mind and spirit in the feet. In addition, Reflex in English means reaction \u2013 which signifies that touching the foot, causes a reaction in the body.\nLogic meaning, science.\nA bit of history:\nThere is evidence that as early as 2000-3000 years ago there were therapists through the feet in both the Far East and Egypt.\nAnita Diamant\u2019s book The Red Tent deals with birth treatments and the like as early as ancient Egypt.\nToday\u2019s reflexology was founded at the beginning of the last century when the surgeon Dr. William Fitzgerald who conducted various studies on his patients realized that pressing on different points in the foot leads to pain relief or anesthesia. Dr. Fitzgerald called this method Various body systems.\nAlong with the same doctor, a physiotherapist nurse named Eunice Ingham worked. She who perfected and shaped the method of reflexology to the method used today and succeeded in proving that the whole human body can be treated through the feet.\nSister Ingham was the one who gave the field the name reflexology, created the first reflexology map and also wrote the first book of reflexology (stories that feet tell).\nBecause there is a direct connection between body and mind, reflexology works in an amazing combination on both.\nSince humans are part of nature, reflexology reflects nature in the feet.\nNature has 4 main elements and reflexology maps these 4 components and their reflection in the feet as well:\nThe earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element.\n- Soil \u2013 The soil element in the body is from the pelvis down. In the foot the earth element is located in the heel (360 degrees).\n- Water \u2013 The water element in the body is from the pelvis to below the chest (diaphragm muscle). In the foot the water element is located from the heel terminal to below the tread pad (360 degrees)\n- Fire \u2013 The fire element in the body is below the chest to the middle of the throat. In the foot the fire element is located in the entire area of the tread pad (360 degrees).\n- Air \u2013 The air element in the body is from the end of the throat to the tip of the head. In the foot the air element is located throughout the toe area (360 degrees).\nEach element represents different physiological systems as well as personal characteristics:\n- The earth element \u2013 represents all the bones and teeth in the body, stability, roots, determination, confidence and self-confidence, strength and power, growth, inclusion, fertility, habits, instincts, basic needs of man and the past.\n- The water element \u2013 represents all the fluids in the body, calmness, flow, power, determination, willpower, cleanliness and purity, clarity and clarity, rejuvenation, intuitions, adaptability, emotions and the present.\n- The fire element \u2013 represents all the muscles and tendons in the body, strength, passion, creativity, warmth, energy, doing, ambition, physical touch, excitement, enthusiasm, giving and receiving, breathing, patience, patience, love, material transformation desires and the near future.\n- The air element \u2013 represents the nervous system, spirituality, clarity, serenity, ability to listen, think, cleanse, most senses, optimism, dreams and fantasies, expression, communication, understanding and ability to analyze situations, thoughts and the distant future.\nIn a Western way, the various organs in the human body communicate with each other, work in harmony with each other, pass information between them and dispose of waste.\nHolistically, similar to the body\u2019s physiological lymphatic system, there is a network of energetic channels between the organs which drains into the feet, where there are \u201cdrainage ponds\u201d. When there is a certain problem with one organ or another, a lot of waste accumulates in the \u201cdrainage pool\u201d and the body strives to dispose of this waste.\nThe ancients lived in nature and walked barefoot on the ground, stones, sand, vegetation \u2013 the feet would receive a massage naturally and regularly, and the debris from the feet would be transferred to the ground.\nToday, we also walk less and when we are already walking, we wear shoes and usually walk on straight surfaces.\nBy doing so we have effectively severed the connection of the feet with the ground and we prevent grounding to the body.\nAs a result, there is a situation where there is a production of waste but it is not possible to dispose of it.\nThe energy waste begins to accumulate and turn into small grains like sand. Over time the grains accumulate into \u201ccrystals\u201d which are actually crystals that are below the surface.\nAt this point the Western approach fits in, as the \u201ccrystals\u201d are known and recognized in conventional medicine. They are well felt by the therapist and often pressing on them is painful for the patient.\nWith the help of reflexology treatment, the therapist breaks down the \u201ccrystals\u201d during a gentle massage. In addition, the energetic and physiological blockages open, and the waste is drained by the bloodstream, urine and other systems out of the body.\nIn this way, reflexology combines the forces of body and mind and brings about a relaxation that is not possible in daily life, now the body can activate its natural healing mechanisms and bring about an improvement in the function of the various organs.\nDuring reflexology treatment, massagers and pressure are applied to certain points in the foot, in this way, a message passes to the body and the brain and begins a process of healing and releasing blockages.\nThe pressures and massages of the feet lead to better blood flow, give life and strengthening to the internal organs, allow cleansing and release of waste and toxins from the body by sweating, urinating and normal bowel activity.\nIn addition, these massages contribute to the relaxation of muscles and strengthen the skeleton, bring about a cleansing load and fatigue from the head and thus help in healing the sick body even in serious diseases.\nReflexology treatment ultimately results in pain relief and the disappearance of various symptoms that the patient has complained of.\nOver the years, reflexology has been recognized by conventional medicine as a complementary and effective treatment for a variety of body and mind problems.\nToday reflexology is common in medical institutions and hospitals and even constitutes complementary care in oncology departments.", "language": null, "image":
