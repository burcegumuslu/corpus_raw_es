But how do you start to work on relationships when you\u2019ve been busy avoiding them?\nThe first step is to invest in relationships you already have. With friends, mentors, and family members who see you as a complex and nuanced person, who don\u2019t just see one side of you. Who ask you questions about your desires and assumptions.\nYou can also challenge yourself when you find yourself denigrating/putting down the impulses, wishes, and pleasures that come with relationships - to care and be cared for, to need and be needed, to be mutually vulnerable with someone.\nEngage your friends in honest conversation about how much they feel they\u2019re getting what they want from relationships and career. How they\u2019re handling building careers at the same time as a relationship.\nSeek out older women you admire and ask them about the dilemmas you\u2019re wrestling with \u2013 if they give you pat answers, challenge them and ask them how they really wrestled with these complex choices and opportunities. Too often people speak to 20-something women in a condescending way \u2013 \u201coh you\u2019ll figure it out, we all do\u201d or in a myopically glorified way \u201coh I loved\n[dating](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/mating) in my 20\u2019s \u2013 it was so fun!\u201d Neither of these responses is helpful, or particularly reflective of the reality of 20-something life.\nWhen you do find yourself in a\n[romantic relationship](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/relationships), be honest and straightforward about your career ambitions AND allow yourself to be vulnerable and not always in control. I know it feels risky to do so. But it\u2019s as important to take risks in your personal life as it is in your professional one.\nYoung women have a lot of training in how to go after what they want in the work world. But you have less training in how to be both ambitious and vulnerable \u2013 how to be independent and need someone at the same time. It seems paradoxical, but it\u2019s the foundation of a successful relationship that will support your career development. The person who loves both sides of you is the one to hold onto.\nRelationships are too important NOT to invest in. And whether you\u2019re with the person you\u2019re going to marry now, or you\u2019ll marry the next person you\u2019re with, or the next one, now is the time to invest in your personal life as well as your career.\nIf you like this post, check out my book,\n[Hard to Get](http://www.amazon.com/Hard-Get-Twenty-Something-Paradox-Freedom/dp/0520261496), follow me on", "language": null, "image":
