Subsequently, multiple rounds of additional independent tests have confirmed these findings at or above the same levels.\nMoms Across America\u2019s Zen Honeycutt sent vaccines to an independent lab earlier this year for testing because \u201cvaccines contain many ingredients which could be genetically modified. 80% of GMOs are genetically engineered to withstand glyphosate based herbicide\n[s and glyphosate is allowed on 160 non organic food and feed crops by the EPA](http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yesmaam/pages/680/attachments/original/139). We wondered if glyphosate could be contaminating not only our [water, urine, breast milk](http://www/), food, soil, beer and wine, but our vaccines as well.\u201d [Moms Across America](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yesmaam/pages/1707/attachments/original/1473090145/LettertoFDACDCandCongressReVanccinesandGlyphosate_(1).pdf?) [ has sent a letter](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yesmaam/pages/1707/attachments/original/1473090145/LettertoFDACDCandCongressReVanccinesandGlyphosate_(1).pdf?1473090145) on September 1, 2016 to the FDA, CDC, EPA, NIH, California Department of Health, and Senator Boxer requesting that they make it a priority to test vaccines for glyphosate, recall contaminated vaccines and for the EPA to revoke the license of glyphosate to prevent further contamination. \u201cAnd in the meantime we call upon our lawmakers to rescind the mandate which forces parents to vaccinate their child in order to attend school, in light of extraordinary new evidence.\u201d\nHoneycutt states, \u201cWe were shocked to find the presence of glyphosate in all five of the vaccines and to find that the contamination of glyphosate has extended into our medical treatments. The fact is that the CDC, vaccine makers and our regulatory agencies should have been testing for herbicide/pesticide contamination 40 years ago before they started spraying these chemicals on our food and feed crops. If anyone questions these results we ask them to test.\u201d\nThe tests were conducted with the Elisa method, (\n[link to full report here)](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yesmaam/pages/1707/attachments/original/1473130173/FullGlyphosateinVaccinesReport_(6).pdf?1473130173) which is regarded by the scientific community as a screening method only and not as accurate as HPLC mass spectrometry. Honeycutt reports that they asked numerous labs to test additional vaccines for glyphosate over the past few months and they have been unable to test. After learning of MAA\u2019s results, an independent scientist conducted numerous rounds of testing, and has confirmed the presence of glyphosate in vaccines. He sent his data to Senator Sheehan, the FDA, NIH, elected government officials, major media, last week and received no response. One can contact [Senator Sheehan](https://www.shaheen.senate.gov/contact/) for the additional test results.\nHoneycutt continues, \u201cThe public must know that their vaccines likely contain glyphosate, a toxic weed killer, which is acknowledged by the EPA as a \u201creproductive effector\u201d ( i.e.: endocrine disruptor) which \"can cause\n[liver and kidney damage](http://www.gmoseralini.org/faq-items/what-)\u201d and has been shown to be a [neurotoxin](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yesmaam/pages/680/attachments/original/1431795616/GLYPHOSATE_neurotoxicity_induced_by_glyphosate-based_herbicide_in_immat). The WHO has deemed glyphosate a [probable carcinogen](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/widely-used-herbicide-linked-to-cancer/). We do not believe any state or government should have the right to mandate vaccines which contain harmful additives including a probable carcinogen such as glyphosate based herbicides, especially to our most vulnerable babies. Certainly, no parent should have to knowingly inject directly into the bloodstream of their newborn, within hours of being born, or growing child, with a probable carcinogen. No pregnant mother should ever be injected with a neurotoxin and endocrine disruptor. We are very concerned that the introduction of glyphosate in our food and feed crops, which correlates with the spike of reports of vaccine damage in the late 1990\u2019s, could be a major contributing factor in the autism epidemic. This must be researched. Testing and reformulation must also be done. We will no longer settle for anything other than safe vaccines.\u201c\nThe question is how does glyphosate based herbicides get into vaccines?\nGMO and glyphosate herbicide sprayed crops are ingredients of vaccines or are fed to livestock.\nMIT scientist,\n[Dr. Stephanie Seneff,](https://people.csai/) added that \u201cglyphosate could easily be present in vaccines due to the fact that certain vaccine viruses (including measles in MMR and flu virus) are grown on gelatin derived from the ligaments of pigs fed heavy doses of glyphosate in their GMO feed. Livestock feed is allowed to have up to 400 PPM of glyphosate residues by the EPA, thousands of times higher than has been shown to cause harm in numerous studies.\"\nFrench scientist and glyphosate expert\n[Seralini\u2019s](http://www.gmoseralini.org/en/) research has shown that glyphosate is never used alone. It is always used with adjuvants (co-formulants/other chemicals) and they have found those adjuvants to make Roundup 1000X more toxic. So the detection of glyphosate in vaccines with this methodology would indicate the presence of other co-formulants which are 1000X more toxic. [Toni Bark](http://www.disease-reversal.com/about-us) MD MHEM LEED AP and Co-Producer of the movie BOUGHT, states, \u201cI am deeply concerned about injecting glyphosate, a known pesticide, directly into children. Neither Roundup nor glyphosate has been tested for safety as an injectable. Injection is a very different route of entry than oral route. Injected toxins, even in minute doses can have profound effects on the organs and the different systems of the body. In addition, injecting a chemical along with an adjuvant or live virus, can induce severe allergic reactions to that substance as vaccines induce the immune system to create antibodies to whatever is included in the vaccine. Since glyphosate is heavily used in corn, soy, wheat, cotton, and other commodities, we can expect to see more severe food allergies in the vaccine recipients. In addition, chemicals in ultra low doses, can have powerful effects on physiology behaving almost as hormones, stimulating or suppressing physiological receptors. \u201d\nContacts:\nZen
