Many are in tropical regions, including Southeast Asia, coastal parts of West Africa, South America and the Caribbean.\nRestoring 30% of ecosystems in these areas could avert more than 70% of projected wildlife extinctions and absorb nearly half of carbon dioxide emitted since the Industrial Revolution, the study said.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re smarter about where we restore nature, we can tick the climate, biodiversity and budget boxes on the world\u2019s urgent to-do list,\u201d said lead author Bernardo Strassburg.\nHe told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that islands \u201ceverywhere\u201d, from the Baltic Sea to Argentina\u2019s Tierra del Fuego, are also top priorities.\nRestoration can be 13 times more cost-effective in developing nations, where land is cheaper, while also delivering biodiversity and climate gains, added Strassburg, executive director of Brazil\u2019s International Institute for Sustainability.\nBut many of the targeted areas are facing economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and will need financial support to do the environmental work, he added.\n\u201cIt makes economic, ecological and climatic sense for rich countries to finance restoration in developing countries, where it is much more cost-effective,\u201d he said.\nThe United Nations is pushing for governments to set aside 30% of the planet\u2019s land and sea areas for conservation - up from about 17% currently - to halt and reverse shocking declines in animal and plant species due to human activities.\nThe new study also said restoration efforts need not cut into food production.\nThe researchers assessed almost 2.9 billion hectares of ecosystems worldwide that were converted to farmland in the past three decades or more, and found 55% could be returned to their natural state without jeopardising food supplies.\nThis could be achieved through intensifying food production sustainably, reducing food waste and shifting away from animal products that need large amounts of land and emit significant greenhouse gases, they said.\nStudy co-author Thomas Brooks, chief scientist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, said the benefits of restoring ecosystems go beyond storing carbon and saving animals, such as a threatened bird species indigenous to Florida\u2019s Everglades he has worked to protect.\nThe rehabilitation of the Everglades, a fragile wetland under pressure from agriculture and urban sprawl, could also help it act as a buffer against potential flooding, he said.\nReporting by Thin Lei Win @thinink; editing by Megan Rowling.
