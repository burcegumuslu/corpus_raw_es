Allergens, sadly, are almost everywhere\u2014from your pets to your yard to your workplace.\nBut there\u2019s good news, too: allergies can be treated by physicians in a wide array of specialties. The most common specialties offering allergy treatments are family practice, pediatrics, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, allergy and immunology, and otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat). No matter what kind of physician you see, allergies are generally treated in the same way.\nAvoiding allergens and using saline spray and other irrigation methods have long been useful in preventing allergy symptoms. But if you need further treatment, allergy management is usually taken in two steps\u2014medication and immunotherapy. Here\u2019s what you need to know about each.\n1. Medications to reduce allergy symptoms\nFor people with inhalant allergies, like\n[pollen](https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/pollen-allergies/) or [pet dander](https://www.lung.org/clean-air/at-home/indoor-air-pollutants/pet-dander), topical nasal [antihistamines](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000549.htm) are the standard first line of treatment. There are several antihistamine sprays in the market that your physician could recommend.\n\u201cThese medications offer the same effects as oral antihistamines in terms of decreasing runny nose and post-nasal drip,\u201d said Ewen Tseng, MD, an otolaryngologist on the medical staff at Baylor Scott & White Medical Center \u2013 Frisco. \u201cThey also help relieve congestion without being an actual decongestant.\u201d\nDr. Tseng said he generally recommends topical medications since they usually have significantly fewer side effects in comparison to oral medications. In oral medications, very little of the medication is absorbed into the body, so topicals tend to have a greater localized effect.\nOther classes of allergy medications can be added with topical antihistamines as needed, such as topical nasal steroid sprays and leukotriene inhibitors.\n2. Immunotherapy (allergy shots)\nIf you do not respond well to medication or are unable to tolerate medications, your physician will typically prescribe\n[immunotherapy](https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/allergy-shots-(immunotherapy))\u2014which looks like an intimidating word, but in this instance represents some very familiar treatments.\nImmunotherapy can come in the form of injections, or allergy shots, given once or twice a week, or topical immunotherapy in the form of drops under the tongue.\n\u201cAbout 85 percent of the patients we place on immunotherapy feel better,\u201d Dr. Tseng said.\nHe added that the effectiveness of both the drops and injections are statistically equivalent and that the serums in both forms are FDA approved.\nThe\n[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology](https://www.aaaai.org/) (AAAAI) notes that while allergy shots are effective for both children and adults, they\u2019re not generally recommended for children younger than 5 years old. Also, you should know that shots are not a method of treating food allergies\u2014the solution there is to avoid the foods that cause an allergic reaction.\nYou should also be aware that immunotherapy for allergies is a two-step process. The first phase gradually raises your immunity by giving you slowly increasing doses of the allergen once or twice a week over several months. Once an effective dose is reached, your doctor will switch to maintenance, with shots of that dose happening less frequently, usually every two to four weeks.\nMaintenance treatment is generally continued for several years. And, of course, you should consult with your doctor before ending an allergy treatment.\nAre you or someone in your family dealing with allergies?\n[Find allergy care near you](https://www.bswhealth.com/specialties/allergy-and-immunology).\nWe make it easy.\nHealthcare doesn't have to be difficult.
