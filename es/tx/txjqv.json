A hernia will not heal on its own; hernia surgery is needed to repair the defect in the abdomen wall. If not treated, a hernia can get larger and can also lead to serious health complications.\nHernia surgery can be done quickly and safely to repair various types of hernias, including hiatal hernias, Bochdalek hernias, Morgagni hernias and abdominal wall hernias.\nThe experienced hernia surgeons here handle the more complex, large and recurrent hernias with newer techniques, including robotic surgery. They use the latest tools and materials for hernia repair that lead to lower recurrences and fewer complications.\nTypes of hernias treated\nWe treat various types of diaphragmatic and abdominal wall hernias, including:\nAbdominal wall hernias\nDifferent types of abdominal wall hernias include:\n- Inguinal hernias\n- Umbilical hernias\n- Complex ventral and incisional hernias\n- Spigelian hernias\n- Flank hernias\n- Recurrent hernias\nBochdalek hernias\nBochdalek hernias are located closer to the back and are rare.\nThey occur when an opening exists, and it allows fat, the stomach or the intestines to enter the chest cavity.\nHiatal hernias\nA hiatal hernia occurs when there is a weakness or opening in the diaphragm.\nThe stomach bulges through the weakened diaphragm, sometimes causing reflux, difficulty swallowing and vomiting.\nHiatal hernias are the most common type of diaphragmatic hernia.\nMorgagni hernias\nMorgagni hernias are located toward the front of the thoracic cavity and are an anterior defect.\nThe colon or omentum (the fatty folds that hold the intestines and other abdominal organs in place) are most at risk of bulging through the chest cavity.\nA Morgagni hernia is relatively rare and usually does not cause symptoms.\nHow to prepare for a hernia surgery\nYour physician will talk with you about getting ready for hernia surgery.\nFollow all the instructions the physician gives you, and be sure to:\n- Tell your physician about any medicines, supplements or herbs you are currently taking, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines. You may be asked to stop taking them.\n- Stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and other NSAIDs seven to 14 days before surgery.\n- Arrange for someone to drive you home after the surgery.\n- Stop smoking; smoking affects blood flow and can slow healing following hernia repair.\n- Gently wash the surgical area the night before the hernia surgery.\n- Follow any directions you are given for not eating or drinking before surgery.\nWhat to expect during hernia surgery\nOn the day of surgery\nArrive at the hospital at your scheduled hernia surgery time; you\u2019ll be asked to change into a gown.\nAn IV will be inserted in your hand or arm to provide fluids and medicine.\nShortly before the surgery, an anesthesiologist will talk with you to explain the types of anesthesia used to prevent pain during the hernia surgery.\nYou will have one or more of the following:\n- Monitored sedation to make you relaxed and sleepy\n- Local anesthesia to numb the surgical site\n- Regional anesthesia to numb specific areas of your body\n- General anesthesia to let you sleep during the hernia repair\nFixing the weakness\nHernia surgery repairs the weakness in the abdominal wall.\nMost hernias are treated using \u201ctension-free\u201d repairs. This is a type of hernia surgery that uses special mesh materials to repair the weak area.\nThe mesh covers the weak area like a patch and is made of strong flexible plastic that stays in the body. Over time, nearby tissues grow into the mesh to strengthen the hernia repair.\nAfter hernia surgery\nAfter the hernia surgery when the procedure is over, you\u2019ll be taken to the recovery area to rest.\nYour blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored; you\u2019ll also have a bandage over the surgical site.\nTo help reduce discomfort, you\u2019ll be given pain medicines. You may also be given breathing exercises to keep your lungs clear.\nLater you\u2019ll be asked to get up and walk; this helps prevent blood clots in the legs.\nYou can go home when your physician says you\u2019re ready following hernia surgery.\nRisks and possible complications of hernia surgery\n- Bleeding\n- Infection\n- Numbness or pain in the groin or leg\n- Risk the hernia will recur\n- Damage to the testicles or testicular function\n- Anesthesia risks\n- Mesh complications\n- Inability to urinate\n- Bowel or bladder injury", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null,
