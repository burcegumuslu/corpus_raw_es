It grows best in acid, sandy soils and tends to spread into dry areas and stressed rangelands. In general, it is well adapted to similar soils and climates as grama (Bouteloua) and three-awn (Aristida) grass communities. Because it grows profusely in the early spring and late fall, when warm season grasses are dormant, sandwort drymary can out-compete native vegetation. Sandwort drymary is highly toxic for cattle, sheep, and goats, and it has caused severe damage to the cattle industry in Chihuahua, Mexico.\nDescription\nSandwort drymary is a spreading, perennial herb that can be as long as 8 inches. It has a long, slender taproot, and it reproduces by seeds.\nLeaves\nThe leaves are opposite and have smooth margins. They are linear and 0.2 to 0.6 inches long, gradually becoming smaller towards the top of the stem.\nFlowers and Fruits\nThe flowers are white with five petals that are each 0.15 to 0.25 inches long. The petals have six to eight lobes. The flowers occur individually in the spaces between the leaf and the stem.\nThe fruit is an egg-shaped capsule (a dry fruit composed of more than one carpel that opens at maturity) with 15 to 25 seeds. Each seed is shaped like a \u201dC,\u201d but with the ends touching.\nSimilar Species\nSandwort drymary is closely related to inkweed (Drymaria pachyphylla), which is found from western Texas to southeastern Arizona.\nReferences\nDuke, J.
