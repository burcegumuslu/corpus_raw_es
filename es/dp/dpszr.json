This is the case of the Azores Islands, which has a wet climate, but temperate maritime, that promotes the planting of this type of plant. In the area where the Manor is da Cruz \u00abwe have a climate similar to the of the Azores\u00bb, hence we have this so extensive plantation and has so much quality.\nGreen tea and soon white tea\n[for the time being, if they decide to go to Quinteiro Pazo Da Cruz, can ask to serve you a delicious Cup of green tea, made with the second and third outbreak of the tea plant. \u00abOurs is a tea that has very little protein and which is not bitter.
