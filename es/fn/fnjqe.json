Monardes, a Spanish physician from Seville, never traveled to America. He was able, however, to study exotic plant specimens in his native city because of Seville's control over the navigation and commerce operating between Spain and the New World. Monardes maintained a botanical garden filled with native and exotic plants and made scientific studies of those plants imported from the Americas including coca, mechoacan, tobacco, sunflower, sarsaparilla, and sassafras detailing their curative virtues.\nSecond edition of Monardes' early work on the medicinal plants of the New World, first published in 1565.\nTwo volumes in one, each in two parts, 8vo (165 x 108 mm).
