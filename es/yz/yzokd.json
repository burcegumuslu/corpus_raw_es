Prometra is an African research and treatment center based in Senegal focusing on the potential of traditional medicines and treatments in battling diseases. Dr. Erick Gbodossou, Prometra\u2019s director and leader of the research team, said that the plants used are easy to harvest and indigenous to many forested regions of Africa, especially West Africa.
