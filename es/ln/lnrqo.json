We recognize the impact food safety issues can have on the health and wellness of a global population. We also understand the devastating impact food pathogen outbreaks and subsequent recalls can have on a food producer.\nWith these items in mind, Crystal Diagnostics moved to create a breakthrough new food pathogen testing platform, the\n[AutoXpress](/contact) [\u00ae](/contact). The [AutoXpress](/contact) [\u00ae](/contact) is a fully automated, high throughput testing platform designed for today\u2019s busy testing laboratories. We utilize\n[liquid crystal technology](/about#LiquidCrystalTechnology)\nwithin this advanced immunoassay to rapidly separate the target from the \"background noise\", thus providing prompt, accurate, and reliable food testing results. This cutting-edge technology mitigates Amplification, DNA Sharing, and Dead Cell Detection!\nThe automated workflow on the\n[AutoXpress](/contact) [\u00ae](/contact) increases testing speed while nearly eliminating human error. This innovative technology can help reduce dangerous food pathogen illnesses and extremely costly recalls by producing the fastest automated test results in the food testing industry.\nCDx currently has 25+ AOAC accreditations\nListeria monocytoge\n[nes Antibody K](/)it", "language": null, "image": "https://lirp.cdn-website.com/e2a7fc9c/dms3rep/multi/opt/logo-1920w.png", "pagetype": "website", "links": ["/", "/autoxpress", "/products", "/resources", "/about", "/storecd03a5ff", "/support", "/sds", "/careers", null, "/", "/products", "/autoxpress", "/products#AXTestKits", "/products#AXEcoli", "/products#AXSTEC", "/products#AXSalmonella", "/products#AXListeriaMono", "/products#AXListeriaSpecies", "/products#AXMedia", "/products#1112663970", "/products#1139269015", "/resources", "/about", "/about#History", "/about#LiquidCrystalTechnology", "/about#News", "/about#Leadership", "/storecd03a5ff", "/support", "/careers", "#", "/products#AXMedia", "/products#MTSBNMedia", "/products#ListeriaMedia", "/products#AXTestKits", "/products#AXEcoli", "/products#AXSTEC", "/products#AXSalmonella", "/products#AXListeriaMono", "/products#AXListeriaSpecies", "/about", "/about#History", "/about#LiquidCrystalTechnology", "/about#Leadership", "/support", "/autoxpress", "/about", "/support", "/contact", "/contact", "/contact", "/contact", "/about#LiquidCrystalTechnology", "/contact", "/contact", null, null, "https://us.vwr.com/store/", null, "https://hardydiagnostics.com/", "https://us.vwr.com/store/", "https://hardydiagnostics.com/", "https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/e2a7fc9c/files/uploaded/AX%20E.%20coli%20O157.pdf", "https://irp.cdn-website.com/e2a7fc9c/files/uploaded/AX%20STEC.pdf", "https://irp.cdn-website.com/e2a7fc9c/files/uploaded/AX%20SALM.pdf", "/", null, "https://tools.cdc.gov/api/embed/downloader/download.asp?m=316422&c=737222", "https://tools.cdc.gov/api/embed/downloader/download.asp?m=316422&c=737137", "https://tools.cdc.gov/api/embed/downloader/download.asp?m=316422&c=737113", "https://tools.cdc.gov/api/v2/resources/media/316422.rss?paged=1", "/", "tel:720-351-4900", "tel:720-351-4900", "/", "/autoxpress", "/products", "/resources", "/about", "/storecd03a5ff", "/support", "/sds", "/careers", "/terms-and-conditions", "http://webact.com"]}
