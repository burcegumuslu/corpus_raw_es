The country has a high degree of vulnerability \nto climate change, and while many productive sectors face profoundly impacted conditions, artisanal fishers and small-\nscale fish farmers are among the most severely affected because of both their geographical locations and their economic \nstatus. Thus, actions that support and promote the adaptation of this sector are necessary to address climate change and \nother related issues.\nWith funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n(FAO), Chile\u2019s Undersecretariat of Fisheries and Aquaculture and the Ministry of the Environment, conducted a project, \nfrom 2017 to 2021 entitled, \u201cStrengthening the Adaptive Capacity to Climate Change in the Fisheries and Aquaculture \nSector\u201d, to help reduce the vulnerability of four coves and their communities.\nPrimary results and innovative aspects of the project are presented in keeping with its three main components: strengthening \nof public and private institutional capacities; improvement of the adaptive capacity of artisanal fisheries and small-scale \naquaculture; and strengthening knowledge and awareness about climate change in fishing and aquaculture communities. It \nalso details the lessons learned during the project, with the goal of providing the authorities and communities involved in the \nfisheries and aquaculture sector with the capacity and tools required to adapt to future climate scenarios. Recommendations \nare made for scaling-up adaptation actions in the pilot coves and making this initiative sustainable beyond the end of the \nproject.6\nEFFECT OF WATER SALINITY ON THE OXIDATIVE SYSTEM OF JUVENILES OF \nTHE NORTH ATLANTIC WHITE SHRIMP  Litopenaeus setiferus REARED IN BIOFLOC \nTECHNOLOGY\nDiana Aguilera-Rivera*, Manuel Valenzuela-Jim\u00e9nez, Claudia Durruty-Lagunes, Gerard Cuzon, \nEduardo Pacheco, Miguel Ar\u00e9valo, Wilson Wasielesky, Gabriela Rodr\u00edguez-Fuentes, \u00c1lvaro Barreto, \nand Gabriela Gaxiola\n*Escuela Nacional de Estudios Superiores-Unidad M\u00e9rida, Tablaje Catastral No. 6998, Carretera \nM\u00e9rida-Tetiz km. 4.5, Municipio de Uc\u00fa, Yucat\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico, C.P. 97357\ndiana.aguilera@enesmerida.unam.mx\nLitopenaeus setiferus  is a native species of the North Atlantic; it shows good survival in seawater or in low salinity in clear \nwater systems. However, its reduction in the natural population puts it at risk from an ecological viewpoint not only for \nits capture but also for its conservation. Biofloc have proven to be a sustainable alternative for other native shrimp species \n(Emerenciano et al., 2012; Maga\u00f1a-Gallegos et al., 2018). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of \nbiofloc at high and low salinity on the antioxidant activity, and oxidative damage of L. setiferus .\nL. setiferus  postlarvae were separated into two groups: low and high salinity (5 and 35 psu, respectively). Shrimp were \ndistributed into six fiberglass tanks and acclimated for 5 days. For biofloc stimulation in the experimental tanks, a volume \nof 1,000 L biofloc inoculum was used and filled at full capacity with filtered clear water. Three replicates were established \nand monitored for 90 days. At the end of the experiment, 15 shrimp for each treatment were dissected to obtain a portion \nof muscle tissue for further antioxidant (CAT, SOD, GST) and oxidative damage (PO, LPO) analysis. The contribution of \nsalinity conditions on these parameters were identified by PCA analysis, supporting the tendency obtained by UPGMC to \nvisualize the grouping for each treatment.\nResults suggest that biofloc can stabilize and improve conditions for L. setiferus . During the experimental phase, oxidative \nstress was stimulated, which increased cell damage at low salinity due to the high oxygen consumption under fasting and \npostprandial conditions.\n7\nA VIBRIOSIS OUTBREAK IN THE PACIFIC WHITE SHRIMP, Litopenaeus vannamei \nREARED IN BIOFLOC AND CLEAR SEAWATER\nDiana Aguilera-Rivera*, Alejandra Prieto-Dav\u00f3, Gabriela Rodr\u00edguez-Fuentes, Karla-Susana Escalante-Herrera, \nand Gabriela Gaxiola\n*Escuela Nacional de Estudios Superiores-Unidad M\u00e9rida\nTablaje Catastarl No. 6998, Carretera M\u00e9rida-Tetiz Km. 4.5, Municipio de Uc\u00fa, Yucat\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico. C.P. 97357\ndiana.aguilera@enesmerida.unam.mx\nBiofloc possess a probiotic effect and has a role on mechanisms related to the immune response in shrimp (Aguilera\u2010\nRivera et al., 2018, 2014;). We reported a vibriosis outbreak in a biofloc and clear seawater rearing system. To treat it, \noxytetracycline was administered only in clear seawater tanks, but the results were not successful. To understand the \nmechanisms related to the susceptibility or resistance to Vibrio  of L. vannamei  juveniles reared in biofloc or clear seawater \nduring a vibriosis outbreak, we isolated and identified Vibrio  species, and expression of pathogenicity and oxytetracycline \nresistance-related genes of Vibrio  strains.\nJuvenile L. vannamei previously reared in biofloc (13.98 \u00b1 2.94 g) and clear seawater (11.34 \u00b1 1.54 g) presented mortalities \n(25 and 80%, respectively). Moderate and severe signs of disease were observed in shrimp reared in clear seawater, where \na treatment with oxytetracycline was applied in the feed with only occasionally positive results. Shrimp reared in biofloc \nwere observed to have less multifocal melanization in the exoskeleton and redness in appendages. These signs disappeared \nwithout the addition of antibiotics to treat the possible infection.\nBacterial isolation and molecular identification of strains were performed. V.\nharveyi, V . rotiferianus, Shewanella  sp., Photobacterium  sp. and P. damselae  were identified for both rearing systems. Only \nShewanella  sp. was identified in shrimp reared under biofloc conditions.\nPresence of pathogenicity (toxR) and oxytetracycline resistance (tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), tet(D), tet(E), tet(G)) genes were \nidentified in five strains previously isolated from hepatopancreas of shrimp L. vannamei  reared in biofloc and clear seawater \nsystem.\nAlthough the occurrence of vibriosis in shrimp reared in biofloc is possible, the microbial dynamics in the system help to \ncontrol the development of bacterial diseases produced by Vibrio . In comparison to the clear seawater rearing system, the \npresence of Shewanella  sp. only in biofloc could be related to less severe lesions in shrimp. Although oxytetracycline was \nused for the treatment of vibriosis in the clear seawater system, expression of tet(B), tet(C) and tet(D) genes confirmed the \ninefficiency of the antibiotic we observed by the presence of disease signs and mortality in shrimp.\nBacterial strains isolated from hepatopancreas of shrimp L. vannamei  reared in biofloc and clear seawater system. \n8\nCO-ENCAPSULATION OF  Bacillus subtilis AND \u03b2-GLUCAN IMPROVED PROBIOTIC \nVIABILITY UNDER SIMULATED TILAPIA GASTROINTESTINAL CONDITIONS\nAng\u00e9lica P. C. Alves*, Amanda C. Alves, Brunno S. Cerozi, Rodney A. F. Rodrigues, Jos\u00e9 Eurico P. Cyrino\nEscola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz (ESALQ -USP)\nPiracicaba, SP, Brazil\napcalves@usp.br\nThe use of probiotic bacteria in fish feed is of increasing interest and microencapsulation technology can be used to \nmaintain the viability of probiotic bacteria during processing and storage. In this study oat \u03b2-glucan (70%) was used for \nco-encapsulating probiotic Bacillus subtilis  on the alginate matrix. The spray drying technique was used to produce the \nmicrocapsules. Simulated gastric fluids (SGF) of Nile tilapia were prepared using saline solution, adjusted pH to 1.5, using \nHCl solution. Exactly 0.5 g of B. subtilis  microcapsules and 0.5 mL of free B. subtilis  were placed into separated test tubes \ncontaining 4.5 mL of SGF. One mL of each sample was taken after incubation at 25 \u00b0C in a water bath for 0, 1, 2, and 3 h \nand enumerated for the cell counts on LB agar using a pour- plate method (Figure 1). For bile tolerance determination, 0.5 \ng of B. subtilis microcapsules and 0.5 mL of B. subtilis free cells were added into 4.5 mL of SGF at pH 1.5 and incubated \nat 25 \u00b0C for 1 h. After the incubation, the samples were then centrifuged. Then, SGF was removed and replaced with 4.5 \nmL of tilapia bile salt (10%). One mL of each sample was taken after further incubations of 1, 2, and 3 h at 25 \u00b0C and \nenumerated on LB agar using a pour-plate method to determine for the number of viable cells (Figure 2). Results were \nsubjected to ANOV A and Tukey\u2019s test (p<0.05).\nThe combination of \u03b2-glucan with sodium alginate improved viability of Bacillus subtilis  under simulated tilapia \ngastrointestinal conditions. The spray dried B. subtilis  with \u03b2-glucan could be incorporated into the feed ingredients to be \npelleted or after feed pellet grading through a coating process, providing valuable ef fects to the fish.\n \n9\nASSOCIATIVITY TO INNOV ATE IN AQUACULTURE\u2019S PRESENT AND FUTURE \nCHALLENGES. THE CHILE CASE\nAdolfo Alvial\nLic.Bio.,MSc,MBA\nClub Innovaci\u00f3n acu\u00edcola & ORBE XXI\nCasilla 1003, Puerto Varas, Chile\nadolfoalvial@gmail.com\nThe aquaculture industry in Chile is widely dominated by salmon farming, which is currently producing more than 1 \nmillion t and 5,000 million USD export value, representing around 90% of total Chilean aquaculture production. The \nsalmon industry was a macro innovation in the south of the country, taking advantage of a market opportunity, comparative \nadvantages, and a rapid process of technology transfer and adaptation. Rapidly, a cluster formed around the original core \nof producers to replace costly imports of goods and to develop national services as well as R+D+I capacities (Fig.1). \nProducers, suppliers, academia, and government agencies all shared a common origin and location, which facilitated active \ncommunication and interaction among them, bolstering innovation. \nChallenges and crises also contributed to the development of national capacities and solutions, with the ISA crisis between \n2007 and 2010 reshaping the production model, reinforcing R+D+I, and emphasizing the importance of collaboration in \nfacing current and future challenges. Technology bloomed as well as R+D centers and the number of technology - based \nsuppliers increased. Following that trend, at the end of 2019, the aquaculture innovation club was created to reinforce \nindividual and collaborative innovation as a tool to generate solutions to complex present and future challenges in the \nindustry. \nAt present, several initiatives in the aquaculture innovation ecosystem have been developed, contributing to the shared \nobjective of building a competitive as well as sustainable industry as well as actively exporting goods and services to other \ncountries.\n10\nEV ALUATION OF GROUNDWATER IN THE COASTAL PORTION OF GUASA VE, SINALOA \nFOR WHITE SHRIMP FARMING ( Penaeus vannamei ) THROUGH VES, CHEMICAL \nCOMPOSITION, AND SURVIV AL TESTS\nJuan Pablo Ap\u00fan-Molina, Mauro Espinoza Ortiz,  Jaime Herrera Barrientos, H\u00e9ctor Jos\u00e9 Peinado Guevara, \nSalvador Isidro Belmonte Jimenez, Apolinar Santamaria Miranda, and Leonardo Roman Palacios M\u00e9ndez\nIPN-CIIDIR, Sinaloa, Boulevard Juan de Dios B\u00e1tiz Paredes 250, Guasave, Sinaloa, M\u00e9xico C.P . 81101, \nInstituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional\nE-mail: japun@ipn.mx\nWe studied the potential of white shrimp farming with groundwater from the coastal aquifer of Guasave, Sinaloa. The \nuse of water from the aquifer in aquaculture represents challenges due variability in quality of groundwater. We did \ntwenty-three vertical electrical soundings (VES), performed to guide the search for continental groundwater, obtaining the \nresistivity of the saturated formation (Ro) and a relationship with resistivity of aquifer water of Rw=0.4478 Ro + 0.8371. \nWe obtained ionic content and nutrients from shrimp farming water. Also, positive corre-lation was found between the \nelectrical conductivity of the aquifer water (inverse of Rw) with chlorine, sodium, magnesium and calcium ions in 34 water \nsamples. The analysis of ions and ammonia-nitrogen, nitrates, phosphates, potassium, manganese and calcium were used to \nselect suitable sites to perform in two shorts bioassays: natural aquifer water and adding KCl and Mg2Cl to simulate diluted \nseawater. In most natural waters, survival of larvae was higher than 60% and in simulated seawater survival improved only \nin two sites. Building Rw-Ro relation allowed to infer the quality and suitability of water and positioning the most suitable \nplace for drilling. Final-ly, Rw relation with dissolved ions, allows to estimate aquifer water quality and reduce uncertainty.\n11\n\u201cEV ALUATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL-PRODUCTIVE AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE \nOF WHITE SHRIMP Penaeus Vannamei  IN FLOATING CAGES IN AN INTENSIVE SYSTEM\u201d\nJuan Pablo Ap\u00fan-Molina*, Jorge Herrera Olmos, Juan Carlos Sainz Hernandez Apolinar Santamaria Miranda  \nand Leonardo R. Palacios\nIPN-CIIDIR, Sinaloa, Boulevard Juan de Dios B\u00e1tiz Paredes 250, Guasave, Sinaloa, M\u00e9xico C.P . 81101, \nInstituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional\nE-mail: japun@ipn.mx\nThe evaluation of the biological-productive and economic performance of two varieties the white shrimp Penaeus \nvannamei in floating cages in an intensive system\u201d. Similarly, in this system no electrical energy and/or fuels are used \nduring cultivation; In addition, the use of antibiotics is completely eliminated, these and other advantages compared to \ntraditional crops. The present work shows that, in financial and economic terms, a floating cage system requires less \ninvestment, reduces operating costs and, together with the commercialization of juvenile P. vannamei as bait, becomes an \ninnovative, sustainable and sustainable business.\nWith this production strategy, no investment is made in pumping water, since this resource is renewed daily with the \nmovement of water through the network caused by the flow of the tides; at the same time, small organisms enter the cage \nand are ingested by the cultured shrimp, which contributes to lowering the feed conversion factor .\n12\nIN-POND RACEWAYS SYSTEM, (IPRS) EXPERIENCES IN LATAM\nEsau Arana*\nAuburn University\nAuburn, AL 36849\nUSSEC\naranaes@auburn.edu\nAs the world population increase, and overall steady world fisheries captures, the urgent demand of aquaculture production \nis eminent. Year increase of World aquaculture products (FAO 2020) decline from more than 6% on years (2001-2005) to \n4% (2016-2018). However, countries like Mexico and Colombia show an increase of 9% on the latest years.  Unite States \ncatfish industry has decline since 2005 (Hanson and Site,2015) due to imports of pangasius to US markets.  IPRS technology \nborn over the necessity to increase production, economically efficient. IPRS is not new, it shows up on the late 90 under \ndirection of Mike Masser, but with a low-key technology.  Dr. Chappell redesigned this technology, creating a water flow \naverage 10 cm/s.  this create a river inside a pond exposing nitrogen derivates to nitrification bacteria and designing a solid \nsettling area where solid can be taken out of the aquatic environment.  This latest feature not only improves water quality \nbut also increase carrying capacity as well as using same water for years.  Production data collected over several countries \nin LATAM shows that fish producer yield an average of 45,000 kg/Ha/Year in two crops.  IPRS technology can increase \nyield at an average of 96,946 kg/Ha/year in three crops, and in many cases more than that with an average ROI % of 39.2\n13\nEFECTOS DEL PROPIONATO DE SODIO DIETARIO EN EL CRECIMIENTO, ACTIVIDAD \nENZIM\u00c1TICA DIGESTIV A Y EXPRESI\u00d3N DE GENES DEL SISTEMA INMUNE EN \nJUVENILES DE PEJELAGARTO Atractosteus tropicus\nJes\u00fas G.

C.P. 91690\n* arellano.jesus@colpos.mx\nIntroducci\u00f3n . El pejelagarto es una especie con una marcada importancia econ\u00f3mica, ecol\u00f3gica y cultural en el sureste \nde M\u00e9xico. La correcta alimentaci\u00f3n en el cultivo de especies acu\u00e1ticas tiene un papel importante en la capacidad de \nasimilaci\u00f3n de nutrientes en los organismos, lo que determina el estado de salud de los peces y con ello, la capacidad \nde respuesta ante posibles enfermedades. Se ha estudiado en el pejelagarto los efectos de diversos aditivos, prebi\u00f3ticos \ny probi\u00f3ticos en su capacidad digestiva. El presente estudio busc\u00f3 analizar los efectos del propionato de sodio sobre \ndiferentes variables adicionado a dietas balanceadas para juveniles de A. tropicus .\nMateriales y m\u00e9todo . Se evaluaron 4 tratamientos con \nla inclusi\u00f3n de Propionato de Sodio (PS) en diferentes \nconcentraciones (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 y 2%) y una dieta control (0%). \nLos peces fueron alimentados 4 veces al d\u00eda, y se tomaron \ndatos biom\u00e9tricos cada 15 d\u00edas. Al final del experimento se \nrealizaron homogenados de est\u00f3mago e intestino por separado \npara determinar la actividad enzim\u00e1tica digestiva. Se realiz\u00f3 un \nan\u00e1lisis de expresi\u00f3n de genes en intestino e h\u00edgado mediante \nqPCR, los genes analizados fueron ocludin (ocln), dominio \nde oligomerizaci\u00f3n por uni\u00f3n de nucle\u00f3tidos (nod2) y mucina \n(mucc2) . Una vez comprobados los supuestos de normalidad \ny homocedasticidad se realiz\u00f3 un ANOV A de una v\u00eda con una \nsignificancia de 0.05, utilizando el software GraphPad Prism \nv.8.0.2.\nResultados . Los peces alimentados con 0.5% y 1.5% de PS \nmostraron el mejor promedio en cuanto al peso (25.79 \u00b1 8.73 \ng) y talla final (17.83 \u00b1 2.42 cm) respectivamente. La mayor \nsobrevivencia ocurri\u00f3 en los tratamientos 1.5 y 2 % de PS ambas \ncon 92%. El tratamiento 1.5% PS mostr\u00f3 mayor actividad de la \nenzima proteasa \u00e1cida, mientas que el tratamiento 0.5% tuvo \nmayor actividad para proteasas alcalinas y quimotripsina, \nmostrando diferencias significativas respecto a los dem\u00e1s \ntratamientos (Figura 1). La inclusi\u00f3n de 1.5% PS promovi\u00f3 un \nincremento en la expresi\u00f3n de los genes ocln, nod2 y mucc2  en \nintestino, y ocln y nod2 en h\u00edgado (Figura 2). \nConclusi\u00f3n . La inclusi\u00f3n de propionato de sodio en las \ndietas balanceadas para pejelagarto no es completamente \ndeterminante en el crecimiento y la actividad enzim\u00e1tica \ndigestiva. Sin embargo, la mayor supervivencia se encontr\u00f3 en \nlas concentraciones m\u00e1s altas, sugiriendo que el PS fortalece \nla barrera intestinal de dicha especie mejorando su sistema \ninmune. \n14\nRESTORATION OF THE BIODIVERSITY OF CORAL REEF FISH ASSEMBLAGES IN THE \nMEXICAN CARIBBEAN\nArias Gonz\u00e1lez JE*, Cort\u00e9s-Useche C, Reyes-Gamboa W, Cabrera-P\u00e9rez JL, Calle-Trivi\u00f1o J, \nCer\u00f3n-Flores A, Raigoza-Figueras R., Roshni Yathiraj\nLaboratorio de Ecolog\u00eda de Ecosistemas de Arrecifes Coralinos, Departamento de Recursos del Mar, \nCentro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN, Unidad M\u00e9rida, M\u00e9rida, Mexico\nearias@cinvestav.mx\nGiven the current effects of global environmental change on marine ecosystems, tools to support coral reef restoration have \nbeen substantially diversified. Restoration efforts have focused primarily on the recovery of coral species using different \ntechniques. Harnessing restoration to achieve ecological rehabilitation of the ecosystem needs innovative methods that \ninclude the restoration of coral reef fish assemblages, contributing to the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem \nfunctions and services.\nHere we highlight a multidisciplinary engage \napproach necessary to establish a strong partnership \namong the science, public and private sector. We \nconducted field studies in the northern part of the \nState of Quintana Roo, Mexican Caribbean to analyze \nfor the first-time  possibility of using the capture and \naquarium-culture of post-larvae fish species and \nreleasing the juveniles as a tool for the potential \nrecovery of reef biodiversity resilience. We tested \nthe potential of post-larvae capture using night light \ntraps. We collected 748 post-larvae reef fishes from \n8 orders, 20 families, and 40 species. Acanthuridae, \nPomacentridae, Monacanthidae, and Tetraodontidae \ncomprised the highest species number of post-larvae \nfamilies. We also explored pilot release experiment \nStegastes partitus  and a landscape analysis across the \nMexican Caribbean as a potential tool to determine \nappropriate reef sites to release the cultured juveniles \nand for adding an ecological planning. The results of \nthe pilot release experiment with S. partitus , showed \nthat there is a positive effect in survivorship during the \ncapture and release procedures into suitable habitat. \nBoth technique approaches allow sustainable capture \nand culture of post-larvae fish species and can be \ncombined with different techniques of conditioning \nand release to supply target reef sites. Using this \nmethod in fish-scarce coral reefs with vulnerable food \nwebs may be helpful to test the feasibility and potential \necological, fisheries and aquaculture application.\n15\nTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT AGAINST OPPORTUNISTIC COPEPODS AFFECTING \nCULTURED SEA CUCUMBER  Isostichopus badionotus\nKaren A.

Cordemex, M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico\nkaren.arjona@cinvestav.mx\nDuring the culture of Isostichopus badionotus  in tanks at Telchac, Yucat\u00e1n, we found high abundance of harpacticoid \ncopepods producing skin lesions. The wounds were colonized by opportunistic pathogens such as bacteria, which in turn \nled to Skin Ulceration Disease (SUD). Organophosphate pesticides such as trichlorfon have been used in concentrations \nbetween 1-5 ppm for up to 12 h, to control copepods in sea cucumber aquaculture, followed by a comprehensive water \nexchange to eliminate the compound from the farming system. However, trichlorfon has been banned in Mexico since \n2019. \nAn alternative compound could be Temephos, an organophosphate endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to \ncontrol the freshwater copepod Cyclops vernalis , an intermediate host of the nematode Dracunculus medinensis . Therefore, \nour aims were to determine the Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) and 99 (LD99) of the organophosphate temephos to control the \nopportunistic harpacticoid copepods as well as to calculate the therapeutic mar gin of this compound for I. badionotus .\nWe have identified five different copepod morphotypes and the taxonomic specific identification is on its way. The toxic \neffect of temephos was evaluated through 96h static bioassays using stage 5 copepodites and adult copepods. After \nperforming a range detection test, 0.062, 0.125, 0.250, 0.500, 0.100, and 2.000 mg/L were determined as the final bioassay \ndoses and were evaluated for 24 and 48 h of exposition. Preliminary results suggest that temephos LD50 and LD99 at 48 h \nexposure are 0.312 and 0.715 mg/L respectively. Tests are still in progress to obtain the LD50 and LD99 of temephos at 24 \nh, and to calculate the therapeutic margin of this compound for I. badionotus .16\nDIATOM Odontella aurita,  AN ALTERNATIVE FOOD SUPPLEMENT FOR THE \nPREVENTION OF CARDIOV ASCULAR DISEASES AND OBESITY IN THE MEXICAN \nPOPULATION\nBertha O.

The diatom Odontella aurita , native to Baja California Sur (BCS), identified and curated \nat the Northwest Biological Research Center (CIBNOR)  Microalgae Collection, is been proposed as a food supplement \nto help reduce this diseases. O. aurita  shows high fucoxanthin and eicosapentaenoic acid content, both of which have \ndemonstrated a synergic effect against metabolic syndrome, hyperlipidemia, oxidative stress and inhibition of cellular \ncancer lines.  From 2019, the international market for microalgae has grown at a 6% rate with expectations of that trend to \ncontinue to 2027. This represents $56.5 billion dollars. CIBNOR has significant experience in the production of consistent \nquality marine microalgae and the technology transfer process. The biotechnological potential of O. aurita  is based on \nthe high quality nutritious compounds that have direct benefit for the human health, resulting in a compelling product for \na market in need of sustainable alternatives.  Production is ideal in the climate and geography of Baja California Sur. A \nstrategic alliance through a licensing model for the technology transfer is proposed, where technical assistance is tailored \nto the needs of the client.17\nDIATOMEA Odontella aurita, SUPLEMENTO ALIMENTICIO COMO ALTERNATIV A PARA \nLA PREVENCI\u00d3N DE ENFERMEDADES CARDIOV ASCULARES Y OBESIDAD EN LA \nPOBLACI\u00d3N MEXICANA \nBertha Olivia  Arredondo Vega, M\u00f3nica B.

Suite E.\nSan Diego, CA, 92121\naartiles@aquatechcenter.com\nGenetic Overview (GO) is a compelling service to characterize populations in captivity that are usually managed for \ncommercial purposes. Using a set of software tools and calculations the GO report describes the levels of diversity, \nconsanguinity, and the genetic structure of the sampled population. These proprietary techniques of the Center of \nAquaculture Technologies make use of all types of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) arrays: Low Density (LD), \nMedium Density (MD) and High Density (HD). These arrays are now available for a variety of aquatic species, including \nshrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei ), oysters ( Crassostrea gigas  and Crassostrea virginica ), and fish (salmon; ( Salmo salar), \nRed snapper ( Lutjanus peru), cobia ( Rachycentron canadum), yellowtail ( Seriola rivoliana, Seriola lalandi), halibut \n(Hippoglossus hippoglossus), sable fish ( Anoplopoma fimbria ), among others. The option of design and customization of \ngenomic tools for non-traditional aquaculture species is also available.\nThe present work describes the parameters of GO used to characterize these cultured stocks and its biological meaning. \nTo protect the confidentiality, synthetic (simulated) data is used for this purpose. Four fictitious breeding lines; AA, BB, \nCC, and DD are compared to show the meaning of diversity parameters such as the percent of polymorphic loci, the \nheterozygosity (observed and expected) and the Nei\u2019s diversity index. The extent of consanguinity is assessed by pairwise \ncomparisons of the relatedness coefficient (r). Finally, the structure of the breeding lines based on their differentiation or \nsimilarity is explained using the interspecific variation coefficient (Fst), the Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) and \nthe Structure plots.\nSome of the applications of this type of analysis will be further summarized. It is particularly powerful in monitoring genetic \nhealth over time in breeding programs based on mass selection but is broadly applicable to all programs. In general terms, \nthe Genetic Overview is a snapshot of the current state of the population genetic characteristics. It is highly recommended \nat the beginning of the breeding programs of all types to understand the level of diversity and relatedness, and the history \nthat the DNA reveals about previous management and origin of the lines, this helping to device sound breeding strategies. \nAdopting GO into the hatchery practice will help to evaluate the impact of selection and assess the genetic quality of the \nlines, guide the mating decisions to maximize diversity and decrease the rate of inbreeding/relatedness, and consequently \nprovide an evaluation of the genetic management through the production process.  19\nMICROBIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION OF WATER AND SEDIMENTS \nIN THREE FARMS FROM ECUADOR\nAuthors: A.

Texcumar S.A., San Pablo, Santa Elena, Ecuador\n \nIt is understood that there is an association between productivity and microbial diversity in aquaculture systems. For \nexample, changes in bacterial microbiomes are implicated in animal performance, in disease development associated with \nboth bacterial and viral origin, and in dysbiosis (disequilibrium in microbial communities) triggered by environmental \nstressors or diet choice. With the increasing development of novel DNA sequencing technologies, new concepts and cost-\neffective applications have emerged to better understand the role of microbial communities in the growth and health of \nfarmed vertebrates and invertebrates. Evidence of any of the three main mechanisms that lead to dysbiosis, such as the \ndecrease in diversity, the loss of beneficial bacteria and the expansion of pathogens or potentially harmful microorganisms, \ncan be used as an indicator tool for productivity monitoring/forecasting purposes. This work establishes a methodology \nand a pipeline for microbiome characterization in three commercial shrimp ponds in Ecuador. Also, we compare the merit \nof two types of samples (water and sediment) and detect patterns that allow inference on water quality in the ponds and \nevaluation of productive performance of the shrimp.\nBriefly, the samples were filtered to concentrate, remove debris, and capture microbes present. DNA was extracted from \nthe concentrated microbes sequenced to look at the type of bacteria present and the relative amount of each type. This \nwas successful, with clear profiles produced along with some information on pathogen presence.  Alpha diversity is a \nmeasurement of the microbial diversity of each sample. All sediment samples from the three ponds were very diverse with \nalpha diversity scores of over 600. Water samples were markedly less diverse with alpha diversity scores generally less than \n250. For one of the ponds, alpha diversity was relatively high and over 250. For another pond alpha diversity was less than \n100, and a single bacterial species made up over 50% of the bacteria detected in all water samples. In addition, for some \nwater samples potentially pathogenic Vibrio species were identified. \nOverall, this information reveals that monitoring the microbiome of production ponds over a grow-out cycle has the real \nchance to deliver data meaningful for pond management and pond performance. Possible application of this technology/\nanalysis are 1) assessing genotype by environment effects in shrimp performance, 2) understanding of the impact of the \nmicrobes in the growth, development, and survival of shrimp, 3) evaluation of the effectiveness of probiotics or diets, \nand 4) predicting pond performance by evaluation of variations in microbial composition at different timepoints in the \nproduction cycle.20\nEL CULTIVO DE LANGOSTINO MALAYO EN M\u00c9XICO: UNA SEGUNDA OPORTUNIDAD \nPARA  Macrobrachium rosenbergii\nAlberto Asiain*, Juan Reta, Alejandra Garc\u00eda, Diego Platas, Adri\u00e1n Argumedo, H\u00e9ctor Chalate, Karla Gonz\u00e1lez, \nBenigno Fern\u00e1ndez, Jorge Pel\u00e1ez, Ver\u00f3nica Lango, y Ra\u00fal Orozco\nColegio de Postgraduados - Campus Veracruz\nCarretera Xalapa-Veracruz km 88.5, C.P. 91690\nManlio Fabio Altamirano, Veracruz, M\u00c9XICO\naasiain@colpos.mx\nEl langostino malayo  Macrobrachium rosenbergii  se introdujo a M\u00e9xico a principios de la d\u00e9cada de los setentas y \ndurante varias d\u00e9cadas se promovi\u00f3 su cultivo a trav\u00e9s de diferentes dependencias gubernamentales, como una manera de \ndiversificar la oferta acu\u00edcola nacional. Aunque la academia y el sector privado se involucraron, las cifras oficiales muestran \nque \u00fanicamente se registr\u00f3 producci\u00f3n durante el periodo que va de 1995 a 2016. Durante esas dos d\u00e9cadas, los vol\u00famenes \nde producci\u00f3n reportados nunca lograron superar las 300 toneladas anuales. Pero algo ocurri\u00f3 despu\u00e9s y la especie dej\u00f3 de \nproducirse. La evidencia sugiere que los pocos criaderos del gobierno y privados dejaron de producir y ofertar postlarvas, \nlo que ocasion\u00f3 el colapso de la incipiente industria.\nEl escenario nacional ha cambiado. Las especies nativas de Macrobrachium  que tradicionalmente soportaban pesquer\u00edas \nartesanales en M\u00e9xico ( M. americanum  y M. tenellum , en el litoral del Pac\u00edfico; M. carcinus  y M. acanthurus , en el litoral \ndel Atl\u00e1ntico) han disminuido dr\u00e1sticamente, principalmente por sobreexplotaci\u00f3n y destrucci\u00f3n de su h\u00e1bitat. Actualmente, \nlos precios de estos crust\u00e1ceos dulceacu\u00edcolas en el mercado nacional son muy elevados y la creciente demanda est\u00e1 siendo \natendida por producto importado, principalmente de Asia.\nCon la intenci\u00f3n de rescatar el cultivo del langostino malayo en M\u00e9xico, se colect\u00f3 material biol\u00f3gico de algunas granjas \nen el sureste del pa\u00eds, remanente de los lotes que fueron diseminados para su engorda por los \u00faltimos laboratorios que \nestuvieron en funcionamiento. Los organismos fueron trasladados a Veracruz para seleccionar reproductores. A partir \nde las t\u00e9cnicas convencionales de producci\u00f3n de postlarvas a nivel internacional, se adaptaron y evaluaron sistemas de \nproducci\u00f3n que fueran f\u00e1cilmente adoptados por peque\u00f1os productores. Mediante alianzas p\u00fablico \u2013 privadas, se ha \npromovido el establecimiento de nuevos laboratorios de producci\u00f3n de postlarvas, principalmente en el sureste del pa\u00eds, \nque han comenzado a diseminar la semilla entre productores interesados. En la actualidad existe en ese territorio una \nenorme cantidad de infraestructura para cultivo de tilapia, que tiene el potencial de ser utilizada como policultivo con \nlangostino, para gradualmente volver a posicionar la especie como una alternativa rentable, que al mismo tiempo ayude a \ndisminuir la presi\u00f3n sobre los recursos nativos. 21\nTROPICAL SEAWEED CULTIV ATION IN R\u00cdA LAGARTOS, YUCAT\u00c1N, MEXICO: \nALTERNATIVES FOR THE FISHERIES SECTOR \nV\u00edctor \u00c1vila-Vel\u00e1zquez*, Erika V\u00e1zquez-Delf\u00edn, Rom\u00e1n M.

In 2018, OECD countries accounted for more than 60% of the total export value (US$1 billion) \nof seaweed traded for direct human consumption or as raw material. European countries accounted for almost half of the \nvalue of global imports (USD 1.3 billion) of seaweed-based thickeners. Currently, algal biomass produced by aquaculture \nhas expanded with a production of up to 32.4 million tons (FAO, 2020). In Mexico, algal exploitation has developed \nmainly in Baja California from natural populations, and recent aquaculture efforts have been successful. In contrast, on the \nYucatan coast, even with the diversity of algae found, there is no current exploitation. Preliminary experiences showed that \nthe Yucatan peninsula is ideal for algal culture; during 2002 the pilot culture of Kappaphycus alvarezii  was successful in \nDzilam de Bravo, with growth rates of up to 6.5 \u00b1 1 % day-1 (Robledo et al., 2013). Recent experiences under Integrated \nMultitrophic Aquaculture cultivation have shown great potential for Solieria filiformis  and Halymenia floresii . \nCurrently, SEPASY- Secretar\u00eda de Pesca y Acuacultura Sustentable de Yucat\u00e1n is supporting the fisheries sector through \nthe development of aquaculture, including seaweed culture. This study is part of that effort, in which an estuarine area was \nevaluated for the cultivation of algae of potential interest in R\u00eda Lagartos, in collaboration with the fishermen\u2019s cooperative \n\u201cPepineros de R\u00edo Lagartos\u201d. Vegetative specimens of native red algae, selected from wild populations and acclimatized \nstrains, were cultivated in an experimental oyster farm (Table 1, Fig. 1). Outdoor culture systems use low-cost infrastructure \nunder natural conditions; growth rates of each cultivar were determined, and environmental parameters were monitored \nduring the study (2021-2022). The algae were subject to strong environmental changes, especially salinity and temperature, \ntherefore growth rates were highly variable throughout the study period. Some species acclimated to estuarine conditions \nwith positive growth rates ( Rhodymenia pseudopalmata , Gracilaria cervicornis  and Crassiphycus corneus ), which varied \nby season and species. Rhodymenia pseudopalmata  showed a growth rate of up to 8.0 \u00b1 1 % day-1 during the summer \nof 2021, demonstrating a high potential for cultivation. Acclimatization and cultivar selection is crucial for successful \ncultivation and to evaluate different coastal zones to optimize cultivation.\n22\nPROTECTIVE EFFECT OF THE ADRIATIC SEA MACROALGA Codium adhaerens \nAGAINST HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS IN ZEBRAFISH \nDanio rerio  EMBRYOS\nS.

Adriatic Sea is an extremely harsh environment \ncharacterized by high salinity, seasonal oscillations in temperature and relatively shallow depth which indicates increased \nUV radiation. It can be assumed that such conditions have forced macroalgae to evolutionary develop molecules which \ncould through activation of anti-stress mechanisms enable surviving in such a hostile environment. With such a hypothesis, \nCodium adhaerens  was sampled from the Adriatic Sea, extracted with methanol:dichloromethane and further fractionated \nby solid phase extraction to obtain less polar fractions (F3, F4). Chemical composition was determined by UHPLC-ESI-\nHRMS and the antioxidant potential was comprehensively evaluated using colorimetric assays (Folin-Ciocalteu, ABTS, \nDPPH, FRAP) and in vivo  experiments on zebrafish Danio rerio . \nZebrafish D. rerio  embryos were employed for this research, as currently one of the most valuable laboratory model \norganisms for bioactivity determination of natural and synthetic molecules. The results obtained from in vivo  experiments \non zebrafish embryos demonstrated protective effects of tested C. adhaerens  fractions against H2O2 induced mortality (23% \nand 27% declined mortality in 500 \u03bcg/mL of F3 and F4 fractions), along with the significant decrease of reactive oxygen \nspecies (ROS) generation. F3 and F4 in concentration of 500 \u03bcg/mL significantly decreased (p<0.001) ROS generation (60.5 \nand 51.9 % decreased in comparison to H2O2 treatment group). The results obtained by in vivo  assay on zebrafish embryos \ncorrelate well with the ones obtained by colorimetric methods since both C. adhaerens  fractions (F3 and F4) exerted \nsimilar antioxidant activity responses. This can be explained by the presence of bioactive molecules (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS \nanalysis) with already proven antioxidant potential (e.g., carotenoid - fucoxanthin, chlorophyll derivatives - pheophytin \na and pheophorbide a). It should be mentioned that the antioxidant activity cannot be related to the particular compound, \nsince various bioactive molecules could work in synergy. Such findings point out C. adhaerens  as an inexhaustible source \nof natural antioxidants that could be used in research of oxidative stress-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and \nneurodegenerative diseases. This study is published in Pharmaceuticals (doi: 10.3390/ph14090944).\n23\nBROWN SEAWEED ALGINATE AS CARRIER FOR Myrtus communis ESSENTIAL OIL \nSTABILIZATION BY ELECTROSTATIC EXTRUSION\nSandra Balbino*, Maja Repaji\u0107, Erika Dobroslavi\u0107, Daniela Cvitkovi\u0107, Ena Cegledi, Ana Dobrin\u010di\u0107 \nand Verica Dragovi\u0107-Uzelac\nFaculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology University of Zagreb\nPierottijeva 6, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia\nsnedjer@pbf.hr  \nSince bioactive molecules are extremely sensitive to a number of external factors and are often \nunstable, they must be protected and stabilized by encapsulation methods such as spray drying and \nelectrostatic extrusion. Myrtle ( Myrtus communis  L.) has long been known for its beneficial therapeutic \neffects on disorders of various organic systems. Its essential oil is obtained by distillation of the leaves \nand contains various terpenoids, with 1,8-cineole, myrtenyl acetate, and \u03b1-pinene predominating. \nAlginates isolated from brown seaweed are often used as carriers for encapsulation due to their gel \nforming property in the presence of divalent cations such as calcium where alginate solution containing \nbioactive compounds is first dispersed into small droplets and then solidified by gelation. Therefore, \nthe aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of stabilization of myrtle essential oil by the \nformation of brown algae alginate beads.\nMyrtle essential oil beads were prepared by \nelectrostatic extrusion encapsulation and the \neffect of the concentrations of sodium alginate \nas carrier (0.5, 1 and 1.5%) and calcium chloride \nas recipient (3 i 5%) on the yield and physical \nproperties of the beads was studied. Myrtle \nessential oil (5%) was added to sodium alginate \nsolutions together with 0.5% Tween 20 as \nemulsifier and homogenized with a mechanical \nstirrer at 10,000 rpm for 4 min. Droplets were \nformed by extrusion on B\u00fcchi encapsulator \nby applying electrostatic potential of 500 V , \nfrequency 80 Hz with 1 mm needle tip. Yield \n(Figure 1) was calculated as percentage of wet \nbeads weight and showed significant differences \nbetween formulations. The lowest yields \nwere obtained for the samples with the lowest \nconcentration of Na-alginate (0.5%). For both \nCaCl2 concentrations an increase in encapsulation \nyield was observed with increasing Na-alginate \nconcentration with the highest value determined \nin the sample prepared with 3% CaCl2 solution. \nLargest beads (Table 1) were produced with 1.5% \nalginate and 5% CaCl3 while 3% CaCl3 caused less \nvariation between samples. Sphericity improved \ngreatly with the addition of higher levels of Na-\nalginate.\n24\nGENE EXPRESSION IN THE PACIFIC WHITE SHRIMP  Penaeus vannamei UNDER \nCOMPENSATORY GROWTH PREVIOUSLY EXPOSED TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES \nAND TEMPORARY FASTING\nDiana Barajas-Sandoval1*, Cristina Escobedo-Fregoso1, Alberto Pe\u00f1a-Rodr\u00edguez1\n1*Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste, S.C. Av. Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional 195 \nPlaya Palo de Santa Rita Sur. La Paz, B.C.S. 23096, Mexico\ndbarajas@pg.cibnor.mx \nThe Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei , is the most cultivated species worldwide, however, during cultivation, \nenvironmental changes can occur that generate stress and alter the normal growth of organisms. When stress is temporary \nand favorable conditions for growth are restored, shrimp may exhibit an accelerated growth rate known as compensatory \ngrowth (CG), which allows them to reach partially or fully the weight of non-stressed organisms. However, if stress is \nextreme, the CG response capacity may be limited and reach a no-return point. The aim of this study was to evaluate the \neffect of temperature and temporary fasting periods on the CG response of P . vannamei and to determine gene expression \nduring this process. \nShrimp P . vannamei  with an average weight of 0.75 g were exposed to different stress periods with fasting for 3, 7, and \n14 days. Simultaneously, each period was analyzed under three temperatures: 22\u00b0C, 26\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C. Each period was \nfollowed by a recovery stage in which feeding and temperature were restored ad libitum  and 30\u00b0C, respectively, for the \nremaining time of the 5 experimental weeks. Treatments were evaluated in triplicate and compared with a control group \nfed to satiety and at 30\u00b0C throughout the experiment. Specific growth rate (SGR, % day-1), weight gain (WG), survival (S), \nfood intake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were weekly determined and muscle was sampled from all treatments for \ndifferential gene expression (DGE) analysis. \nOrganisms exposed to 3 days of fasting achieved the same weight as those in the control group, which indicated a complete \nCG, whereas organisms exposed to 14 days of fasting reached the no-return point, being unable to compensate growth and \na reduction in WG (>50%) was observed. The SGR and FI were higher in shrimp exposed to 3 days of fasting, however, \nwithin this group, FI and FCR were lower at 26\u00b0C, suggesting shrimp were more efficient to use the nutrients at this \ntemperature. The DGE with respect to the control group showed over-expressed genes related to the use of stored energy \nand the molting process during CG (Table 1), whereas genes related to cell damage repair were overexpressed in organisms \nthat reached the no-return point (Table 2).\nPenaeus vannamei  exposed to 3-day fasting were able to fully compensate their growth and overexpressed genes related \nto the use of stored energy and the molting process, whereas an extended fasting of 14 days affected their CG response \nreaching the point of no-return and induced over-expression of genes related to cell damage repair.\n25\nANTIMICROBIALIN VITROACTIVITY OF PHYTOEXTRACTS Allium sativum , \nOriganumvulgare, Curcumalonga AND Cinnamoniumverum AGAINST Streptococcus agalactiae \nIb ISOLATED FROM TILAPIA ( Oreochromis sp.)

Esto ha comprometido seriamente la seguridad alimentaria exigiendo una visi\u00f3n \nde futuro en los sistemas de producci\u00f3n acu\u00edcola, priorizando la necesidad a ser m\u00e1s resiliente a dichos cambios, lo que \nderiva en una b\u00fasqueda de indicadores de resiliencia acu\u00edcola a nivel ambiental y socio-econ\u00f3mico en las unidades de \nproducci\u00f3n, para garantizar la capacidad de recuperaci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de un shock , ya sea de tipo antropog\u00e9nico o natural. En \nt\u00e9rminos ecol\u00f3gicos, la resiliencia est\u00e1 referida a la capacidad que tiene un sistema para enfrentar y acomodarse a factores \nperturbadores manteniendo sus funciones pese a las alteraciones. \nEn esta investigaci\u00f3n se evaluaron 10 unidades de producci\u00f3n acu\u00edcola, en un periodo espacio temporal de diez a\u00f1os, \nconsiderando 5 indicadores de resiliencia ambiental que se involucran en la producci\u00f3n, determinado en base a ellos \ndos categor\u00edas: nivel de resiliencia y factor de riesgo ambiental.

The objective of this study was \nto calculate the bioeconomic effect of size heterogeneity on the production of Nile tilapia at a commercial level and to \ndetermine the optimum harvest time (OHT) considering four minimum marketable sizes target (MMS = 350, 400, 450, \n500 g).\nA trial of 330 days was conducted in a hatchery of a commercial farm, Nile tilapia fingerlings were reared at the same \nstocking density (40 ind m-3) with different fish sizes: homogeneous size (HM) and heterogeneous size (HT). The initial \nmean weight \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) of the organisms was HM = 100.17 \u00b1 5.91g and HT = 96.55 \u00b1 24.58 g, with three \nreplicates for treatment. The initial variance of HM and HT was \u03c3\u00b2 34.91 and \u03c3\u00b2 604.19, respectively.\nThe optimal harvest time (OHT) corresponds to the time at which the quasi-profit of the variable costs (understood as the \nprofits obtained after paying for the variable costs of production) are maximized. The large variation in the size observed \nin the tilapia of the same cohort illustrates a high propensity of the organisms to develop and grow at different rates. The \nbiometric data of discrete 15-day periods, for the 330 day study period was used for the bioeconomic analysis.   \nThe seeding of homogenous organisms is highly recommended to the farmers, because the heterogeneity at seeding \nnegatively affects the system performance by lowering biomass, in addition to reducing the quasi-profits of the variable \ncosts.\n29\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF INTRODUCING A DESIGN CODE TO THE AQUACULTURE \nINDUSTRY IN NORWAY AND THE EFFECT ON FISH ESCAPE\nJoachim Buar\u00f8\nSTIM Knowledge Services, Kj\u00f8pmannsgata 37, N-7011 Trondheim (Norway)\nIntroduction\nFrom the initiation in the 70s to the end of the 90s there was an accelerating development in the growth of the aquaculture \nindustry in Norway. It was observed that the increase in activity led to an increased number of incidents of structural \nfailures leading to fish escape. This led to the development of regulations to make the aquaculture systems more reliable.\nRegulations and design code\nIn 2003 the first revision of the NYTEK-regulations and the relating standard NS9415 was ready to be implemented. \nFurther with the introduction of the aquaculture act in 2005 the authorities got tools that helped improve the robustness \nof the aquaculture plants and decrease the risk for fish escape. The NYTEK-regulation and NS9415 has been through \nrevisions and is currently being revised.\nEffects on fish escape\nThe regulations design code has proven to be effective as the number of fish escapes have plummeted in a period when the \nproduction volume has nearly tripled. The number of escapes due to system collapses are close to none and the few fish \nescape that happen is related to operations and human error. \n30\nEV ALUACI\u00d3N DE TRES PROGRAMAS DE ALIMENTACI\u00d3N SOBRE EL \nCOMPORTAMIENTO PRODUCTIVO DE LA GAMITANA Colossoma macropomum \nPercy Bustamante*, V\u00edctor J.

Una de estas estrategias \ninvolucra el manejo adecuado de la nutrici\u00f3n y alimentaci\u00f3n de la especie. Los requerimientos nutricionales van \ndisminuyendo a medida que los peces aumentan su edad y tama\u00f1o, por lo que es importante conocer el momento \u00f3ptimo \npara realizar el cambio de alimento de una etapa temprana a otra m\u00e1s tard\u00eda. Para ello, se utilizan programas de alimentaci\u00f3n \nutilizando alimentos balanceados de inicio, crecimiento y acabado, con diferentes tama\u00f1os de part\u00edcula, que se suministran \nen cantidades adecuadas de acuerdo a la etapa de cultivo (periodo \u00f3ptimo de cambio de dieta).

Since then, no additional \ndata on this clam has been published to accurately measure the extent of colonization of the freshwater sources in the state \nby this invasive species, nor a corroboration of the identity has been conducted. During the dry season of 2021, many \nshells of dead freshwater clams were observed along the shore of the dam \u201cEmilio L\u00f3pez Zamora\u201d in city of Ensenada, \nBaja California, Mexico. A sampling of these shells was carried out in the dam to perform morphological and molecular \nidentification of the invasive species.  \nMorphological identification was performed using conventional malacological techniques. Molecular identification \nwas carried out by using DNA extracted from the shells and periostracum for whole genome amplification (WGA) in \ncombination with PCR and sequencing. \nThe absence of live organisms during the sampling limited the study to using the shells for the identification. It is unknown \nif a mortality event had occurred that decimated the freshwater clam populations. Both classic malacological and molecular \nidentification, independently, indicated that the clam is Corbicula fluminea , synonymous of C. malianensis . This species is \ncharacterized by a medium-sized bivalve shell, sub-triangular, subequilateral of moderate thickness, black to dark brown \nnear the edge of the shell and yellowish brown on the umbo. Genus specific primers for the cytochrome oxidase subunit \n1 gene of Corbicula  spp. yielded 401 bp (Fig 1) fragment with a sequence identity of 100% to C. fluminea  (GenBank: \nKT893369.1) from the Yangtze River Basin. \nThis is the first record of this invasive species in Ensenada, Baja California confirmed by conventional taxonomy and \nmolecular methods. The molecular identification using the WGA approach as was performed in this study could prove \nuseful for the identification of dead mollusks were limited nucleic acids are available. An interesting potential application \nthat arises is use of this species to aid in biomonitoring and bioremediation of the environment as filter feeder. In addition, \nit could also be used as a source of food, as is currently being exploring in Malaysia.  \n32\nEFFECT OF MEDICATED DIETS WITH FLORFENICOL ON INTESTINAL VILLI IN \nATLANTIC SALMON\nKarla Camacho M\u00e9ndez*, Felipe Ram\u00edrez, Roberto Cruz, Luis Mercado and Jor ge Olivares\nPontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Valpara\u00edso \nAv. Universidad 330, Valpara\u00edso\nKarla.camacho.m@mail.pucv.cl\nIn 2021, 426,309 tons of florfenicol (FCL) were used to control outbreaks of the bacterial pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis . \nThis antibiotic is administered through medicated food as a metaphylaxis strategy. To date, the effect of this drug on the \nintestinal epithelia has not been reported in healthy fish. With the objective to study the effect of FCL medicated food at a \nhistological level on the intestinal epithelium, a biological assay with healthy fish was performed. 240 Atlantic Salmon with \nan average weight of 120 g were divided in three groups were treated by administering feed with different concentrations \nof FCL. Group 1 (no antibiotic, control); group 2 (20mg/kg FCL); and group 3 (30mg/kg). After transportation to the \nexperimental facilities, the organisms were acclimatized for 30 days. Following the acclimation period, the organism were \nfeed with medicated diets following a prophylactic scheme that is identical to those used in commercial production systems. \nThe applied scheme was the following: 15 days of antibiotic treatment; 10 days off; 15 days of antibiotic treatment; and \nfinally, two following periods of 10 days. At the end of each stage, nine fish from each of the groups were euthanized with \nan overdose of MS-222. Each specimen was dissected, and a portion of the intestine was taken, fixed with bouin solution \nand stained with hematoxylin and eosin. We confirmed that fish subjected to the antibiotic treatment had shorter villi and \ndamage in the structure and conformation of the intestinal villi compared to the fish of the control group. These results \nunderscore the importance of optimize antibiotic treatment schemes to mitigate the negative effects associated with current \nmetaphylaxis strategies that undoubtedly affect fish health and welfare. 33\nDNA EXTRACTION FROM A HISTOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE DISTAL INTESTINE \nOF Salmo Salar FIXED IN BOUIN SOLUTION AND EMBEDDED IN PARAFFIN \nKarla A.

However, the applications of these methods are limited by the need for fresh, \nunfixed tissues that allow high-quality DNA extraction. Fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue is an invaluable resource for \nretrospective molecular genetic studies, but high-quality genomic DNA extraction can be problematic1 . Bouin\u2019s solution, a \ncompound fixative, is used in the histological evaluation of cells, due to the nuclear morphological preservation obtained1. \nFixation facilitates obtaining images of cell localization and morphology2. However, it is unknown how bouin fixation \naffects the quality of DNA from the gut distal of Atlantic Salmon. To tap into this potentially huge resource, it is imperative \nto develop methods to isolate high-quality, abundant DNA from fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections3. \nDNA extraction from Salmo salar gut distal high-quality DNA. samples embedded in paraffin, fixed with Bouin\u2019s solution, \nwas evaluated. For this, we use a DNA extraction kit that includes the combination of proteinase K digestion and column \npurification. By means of PCR using primers, we amplified the 16s and 23s gene.

M\u00e9xico\nerikacastro@cicese.edu.mx\nGreen abalone, Haliotis fulgens,  is one of the five species along the \ncoasts of Baja California, Mexico, that has become economically \nimportant. Nonetheless, nonregulated fishing activities and \nanthropogenic impacts have contributed to the decline of its \npopulations, increasing the interest in abalone conservation; \ntherefore, habitat restoration and stocking of native species need \nto be considered. \nCryopreservation of sperm of aquatic species can be helpful in \nsuch programs to protect endangered species in natural disasters \nor accidents that can affect wild populations. Additionally, the \naquaculture industry can also benefit from artificial insemination, \nreducing the risk of disease transmission, creating new lines with \nfavorable traits, conserving stocks, and transporting good quality \ngametes between farms. Developing a cryopreservation protocol \nfor green abalone would aid in such restoration efforts, providing \nan alternative breeding option for this aquaculture industry that is \nnot entirely established.\nThis work aimed to develop cryopreservation protocols for sperm \nof H. fulgens . In this study, three commonly used cryoprotectants \n(CPAs) were chosen: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol, \nand methanol. Four different CPAs concentrations (5%, 10%, \n15%, and 20 %) and four equilibration times (5, 10, 15, and 20 \nmin) were evaluated in a manually controlled cooling Styrofoam \nchamber.\nThawed sperm quality was evaluated by estimating the percentages \nof sperm motility and plasma membrane integrity (PMI) using a \ndual staining technique.  Results suggested that 15% DMSO was \nthe best among the CPAs evaluated, resulting in higher motility \n(48%) and PMI (58%) (Fig. 1). \n35\nEV ALUATION OF PRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE AND BODY CHEMICAL COMPOSITION \nOF THE NILE GRAY TILAPIA Oreochromis niloticus DURING THE FATTENING PERIOD \nUNDER TRADITIONAL CULTURE SYSTEMS AND BIOFLOC TECHNOLOGY\nCastro Fuentes Luis Andr\u00e9s* & Pandal Ba\u00f1os Esther\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico.

To determine the effect of the biofloc system on the water quality, the productive performance and \nthe body chemical composition of the Nile gray tilapia Oreochromis niloticus , an experiment was carried out for 120 days, \nwith two treatments and three repetitions: traditional system (TS) and heterotrophic biofloc system (BFT) ( Table 1 ). Male \nmonosex organisms with initial average weight of 109 \u00b1 39.29 g were used at a stocking density of 100 fish m-3, fed with \nextruded pellets with 32% CP. The final body weight was significantly higher in the traditional system (279.93 \u00b1 78.51 g) \nthan in the biofloc system (183.49 \u00b1 38.57 g) ( Figure 1 ). Water consumption was significantly lower in the biofloc system \n(1.38 \u00b1 0.15 m3) compared to the traditional system (48.4 \u00b1 0.0 m3) (Figure 2 ). The percentage of crude protein in the fillet \nof the organisms grown in the traditional system was significantly higher (17.69 \u00b1 0.42%) in relation to the biofloc system \n(16.56 \u00b1 0.07%) ( Figure 3 ). The results showed that Nile gray tilapia juveniles raised in the traditional system exhibited \nthe higher growth and body chemical composition, however, the biofloc technology was efficient in water consumption, \ndemonstrating the sustainability of the system. \n(Continued on next page)36\n37\nEV ALUATION OF A NEUROSENSORIAL FEED ADDITIVE ON Litopeneaus vannamei \nSHRIMP STRESS REDUCTION \nAmine Chaabane*, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gabarrou \nPrince of Songkla University, Tha\u00efland \nLaboratoires Phod\u00e9 \n8, avenue de la Martelle 81150 Terssac France \nachaabane@phode.fr \nThe marine shrimp aquaculture industry, in particular the whiteleg shrimp Litopeneaus vannamei , has experienced \nexponential technological development, with different production systems worldwide.

Juveniles from stressed (30\u00baC) and unstressed \n(24\u00baC) females were kept at 25 \u00b0C and 30\u00baC for a period of 20 to 30 days. To which the routine oxygen consumption and \nthe maximum activity metabolism, the activity of the antioxidant defense mechanisms (ANTIOX) and some indicators of \nthe damage produced by free radicals (ROS) were measured. It was observed that octopuses from stressed females kept at \n30\u00baC were unable to survive for more than 15 days. In contrast, the octopuses from unstressed females kept at 30\u00baC for up \nto 20 days showed an ability, although limited, to regulate the presence of (ROS).\nGrowth Coefficient (CDC): In experiment 1, temperature did not affect growth. However, there is a tendency to obtain \nhigher growth in specimens exposed to 25\u00b0C. In contrast, in experiment 2 it was observed that temperature exerted a \nsignificant effect on growth (P <0.05) with values 3.1 times higher in the specimens exposed to 30\u00b0C compared to 25\u00b0C.\nIn evaluations of oxygen consumption for both juveniles from stressed and non-stressed females, the specimens exposed to \n30\u00b0C had an oxygen consumption that increased with exposure time, while oxygen consumption was maintained at 25\u00b0C \nconstant.    \nIn the octopuses kept at 30\u00b0C in experiment 1, it was identified that after 15 days of exposure, the enzymes of the antioxidant \nsystem collapsed, allowing the accumulation of peroxidized lipids (LPO). In the octopuses subjected to 30\u00b0C of experiment \n2, it could be seen that they were able to control (ROS) levels from the first day, managing to maintain this until day 12 \nof exposure.

However, as common property resources, the number and \ndiversity of user conflicts increase with proximity to shore. Conflicts result in the overuse of the precautionary approach \nby ocean governance systems which create too many obstacles to increasing the number and sizes of marine aquaculture \noperations nearshore. Sustainable system change to expand marine aquaculture nearshore would consider fully ocean \nengineering advances made offshore that would open up large areas of highly energetic nearshore oceans that have fewer \nuser conflicts.  For example, in this context, offshore would be defined as  a straight line drawn just along the outer edges \nof the state of Maine, USA complex shore of islands/bays a distance about 360 km to Canada, extending about 4 km from \nthe shore. This area is approximately 1700 km2 of theoretically available space in energetic nearshore oceans.  Improved \ndevelopment policies would include access in energetic sites nearshore to scale \u201cout\u201d, and connect these to offshore leasing \nfor operations to scale \u201cup\u201d. The case of the state of Maine, USA and its contiguous sea, the Gulf of Maine (GoM) illustrates \nthe potential for a seamless nearshore-offshore aquaculture governance system. The GoM is a productive marine basin with \npotential for development of both fed and non-fed aquaculture, located in a bioregion that has an historical affinity for \nseafoods. Markets are abundant as consumers have a higher rate of seafood consumption than national averages but the \nregion meets its seafood needs from imports. Nearshore energetic ocean spaces are underutilized aquaculture opportunity \nareas that can serve as well-planned testing platforms for offshore enterprises.  Scaling up of nearshore ocean space for \naquaculture is currently regulated though an ocean-leasing structure tiered by size. Sizes of permitted offshore aquaculture \nsystems have been derived less by applied science than by social/political factors derived from nearshore experiences, e.g. \nthe \u201csocial license to operate\u201d. Maine has a unique nearshore aquaculture research and development permit system for \n\u201cscaling out\u201d of nearshore marine aquaculture development, the limited permit access (LPA) system, which has attracted \nover 700 entrants. We call for the establishment of a quaculture platforms in nearshore, energetic oceans at scale that will \ninform the scale of offshore operations needed for financial success. Platforms will incorporate the best available science \nand participatory tools for improving knowledge exchange from industry to civil society. Sizing permits for offshore \naquaculture should be based more on science than the precautionary principle, which has been overused to govern and \npermit offshore aquaculture.45\nCOMPARISON OF TWO DICTYOTA SPECIES (BROWN SEAWEEDS) BASED ON THEIR \nANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY \nR. \u010co\u017e-Rakovac1,*, L. \u010ci\u017emek1, A.

Brown algae are \nknown for their accumulation of specific metabolites with great antioxidant potential. In this study, we evaluated the \nantioxidant activity of different fractions from two brown macroalgae, Dichtyota dichotoma,  and Dichtyota fasciola . The \nprimarily used method was square-wave voltammetry (SWV), followed by the reduction of the radical cation (ABTS), the \n2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay, the Folin\u2013Ciocalteu, and the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) \nassays. To correlate obtained results for antioxidant activity, Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was used. Toxicity evaluation \nof obtained fractions revealed the safety of their usage and further implementation.\nIn this research, the dry residues of extracts from brown macroalgae samples were immobilized on the surface of GCE \nand immersed into a 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer solution. To evaluate their activity and optimal electrochemical response, \na change in the pH values, ranging from 3 to 11, for all obtained extracts was tested. To assess antioxidant activity using \nvoltammetric analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) was integrated, the value of which represents an estimate of the total \nantioxidant activity of the extracts. The highest antioxidant activity based on the AUC value was obtained for D. fasciola  \nF2 (0.099\u00b10.001 mg/g GAE) followed by D. fasciola  F3 (0.068\u00b10.006 mg/g GAE) > D. dichotoma  F3 (0.050\u00b10.002 mg/g \nGAE) > D. dichotoma  F2 (0.028\u00b10.002mg/g GAE). No significant difference in antioxidant activity was observed between \nfractions of two Dictyota species. Other employed spectrophotometric methods also revealed similar behavior of two \nDictyota species, however, somewhat higher activity was observed for both D. dichotoma  fractions. The Pearson\u2019s correlation \ncoefficient for SWV versus  Folin-Ciocalteu method was a negative value of -0.99 ( p<0.05). For other spectrophotometric \nmethods, there was no statistically significant correlation obtained with SWV . Also, a high negative correlation between \nDPPH and Folin-Ciocalteu assay was observed with Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient of -0.81. Correlations indicate that \nthe synergistic effect of different compounds extracted from the samples impacted their antioxidant response. All three \nresearched brown macroalgae have shown to be a potent source of natural antioxidants that could further be used in the \nresearch of oxidative stress-related diseases.\n46\nUSING FORMALIN-FIXED PARAFFIN-EMBEDDED TISSUES AS A SOURCE OF NUCLEIC \nACIDS FOR MICROBIOME ANALYSIS IN RAINBOW TROUT  (Oncorhynchus mykiss)\nRoberto Cruz-Flores*, M\u00f3nica Hern\u00e1ndez-Rodr\u00edguez, Jes\u00fas Salvador Olivier Guirado Flores, Arun K.

Considering the role of \nthe microbiome in animal health, it is fundamental to explore the utility of microbiota studies using histological samples. \nThese studies could provide valuable insights on how the gut microbiome is modulated upon dietary and environmental \nchanges under which fish are being reared currently compared to rearing conditions in the past.\nIn this study, we analyzed 20 microbiomes targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene derived from \nIllumina\u00ae amplicon sequencing of the rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) acclimated at two temperatures (16\u02da and \n22\u02daC) for five weeks. At the end of the experiment trout were euthanized and the intestine was aseptically removed from \neach fish. Part of the intestine was flash frozen for molecular biology and the other section was fixed for histological \nprocessing. DNA was extracted from both samples, fresh frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), and \nsubjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.\nAmplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA resulted in an average of 17,335 reads for the FF samples and \n5,032 reads for the FFPE samples, corresponding to a total of 735 OTUs. The microbiome of the intestine of the rainbow \ntrout acclimate at 16 \u02daC showed a higher diversity of species ( \u03b1-diversity) (p- value = 0.04) than organism at 22\u02daC when \nanalyzed using FF samples of the intestine. The difference in the diversity was not captured when parallel but FFPE samples \nwere used (p-value = 0.34). The O. mykiss  microbiome was dominated by the bacterial taxonomic phylum Fusobacteria. \nThis phylum constituted a high, but variable, sequence proportion at both temperatures and for both types of samples (FF \nand FFPE) (Fig. 1). This data reveals that microbiome can be successfully determined using FFPE tissue opening a new \nhorizon in studying intestinal microbiota. \n47\nREARING TILAPIA ( Oreochromis niloticus)  IN PONDS FROM A RIVER SPRING: \nECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS\nReinaldo J. da Silva*, Rodrigo B.

We surveyed parasites \nin tilapias collected in ponds from a river spring and discuss its ecological implications.\nDuring an inventory of fishes and parasites conducted in 2020/2021, 32 specimens of O. niloticus specimens were collected \nfrom a spring river area of Pardo River, Botucatu, S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil (23\u00b00\u201921.21\u201dS, 48\u00b022\u201931.99\u201dW) and screened for \nmonogenean, crustacean, and myxozoan parasites. \nThe analyzed tilapias were only infested with monogeneans \n(Cichlidogyrus halli , C. mbirizei , C. thurstone , C. tilapiae , \nC. philander , and Scutogyrus longicornis ) (Tab. 1, Fig. 1) \nand copepods ( Lamproglena  sp., Rhinergasilus piranhus , \nand Tropocyclops  sp.) (Fig. 2).\nMany farmers have lakes on their properties and, for \nseveral reasons and without proper technical knowledge, \ntry to produce tilapia and end up introducing them and their \nparasites as alien species. Studies have been demonstrated \nthe negative impact of the introduction of tilapias on the \npopulation of native fauna.\nTilapias were infested with six monogenean species. \nHowever, these parasites have not been detected in native \nfishes so far. On the other hand, we found three native \ncrustaceans infesting some tilapias.\nWe recommend a management plan to control this alien \nspecies avoiding the extinction of native species and future \nparasite-host switch among fishes, mainly in river springs.\n48\nSUSTAINABILITY OF URBAN AQUAPONICS FARMS: AN EMERGY POINT OF VIEW \nLuiz H David*, Sara M Pinho, Feni Agostinho, Jesaias I Costa, Maria C\u00e9lia Portella, Karel J Keesman, \nFabiana Garcia\nS\u00e3o Paulo State University (Unesp), Aquaculture Center of Unesp (Caunesp), Jaboticabal, SP, 14884\u2013900, Brazil\nluiz.david@unesp.br \nAquaponics is a food production system that aims higher sustainability by integrating advantages gained from aquaculture \nand hydroponic production. Aquaponics aims to mimic the biological process that happens in the natural environment in \na controlled production system. As it can be applied to small scales, aquaponics is considered an important alternative for \nurban regions, which have low availability of agricultural land and water resources.  Furthermore, the advantage is that it \nis located close to final consumers.\nAquaponics has been labeled as an environmentally friendly food production system, but its demand for energy and materials \ncast doubt on its sustainability. A systemic understanding of aquaponics production systems is needed to determine the \nmagnitude and balance between its potentialities and constraints, in which emergy synthesis appears as a powerful tool \nfor this purpose. This study applies emergy synthesis to assess the sustainability of two different (scale and marketable \nproducts) urban aquaponics farms in Brazil, but differently from other emergy studies, ecosystem services and disservices \nare included in the analysis as an attempt to represent the system performance holistically. Results show that the type of \nmaterials used in aquaponics infrastructures has the highest influence on total emergy demand. Surprisingly, electricity \nand fish feed showed a low influence on the total emergy, reinforcing the idea that aquaponics systems have a more \nefficiency feeding management than traditional aquaculture systems. Besides producing vegetables and fish, the inclusion \nof ecosystem services highlights the importance of aquaponics for educational and tourism purposes. Finally, the obtained \nindicators from modeling scenarios revealed that replacing the water source and some materials deserves priority attention \nto increase the sustainability of urban aquaponics farms.\n49\nENZYMATIC RESPONSES TO DIETS WITH DIFFERENT PROTEIN LEVELS IN LARV AL \nAND JUVENILE STAGES OF Brycon moorei  (STEINDACHNER 1878), DORADA DEL RIO \nMAGDALENA, COLOMBIA\nCarlos A.

In a recirculating set-up and with a completely randomized quintuplicate \ndesign, an ad libitum feeding protocol was applied, which included, among others, balanced feed with inclusion levels \nfrom 35% to 55% of crude protein (CP). For this, larvae 22 hours post-hatching (HPH), with an average initial weight \nand length of 3.07\u00b10.69 mg and 6.069\u00b10.22 mm, respectively, were seeded at a density of 17 larvae L-1 in tanks with \nan effective volume of 60 L. The enzymatic activity was analyzed about the experimental diets. Specific activity (SA) of \nserum enzymes (Figure 1, 2, and 3) was found from the beginning of hatching, with fluctuating values   significantly related \nto the feeding protocol and time in HPH and the pepsin-type SA began from the 111 HPH, marking the time in which the \nuse of dry diet can be started (Figure 4).\n50\nINFLUENCE OF DIETARY PROTEIN LEVELS ON ZOTECHNICAL PARAMETERS IN \nLARV AL AND JUVENILE STATES OF  Brycon moorei  (STEINDACHNER 1878), DORADA \nDEL RIO MAGDALENA, COLOMBIA\nCarlos A.

It is not known about their nutritional requirements \nand zootechnical responses concerning formulated diets at any stage of development in this species. In a recirculating \naquaculture system (RAS) and with a completely randomized quintuplicate design, an ad libitum  feeding protocol was \napplied, which included forage larvae of Prochilodus magdalenae, Artemia salina, and balanced feed with inclusion levels \nfrom 35% to 55%. of crude protein (CP). For this, larvae 22 hours after hatching (HPE), with an average initial weight \nand length of 3.07\u00b10.69 mg and 6.069\u00b10.22 mm, respectively, were seeded at a density of 17 larvae L-1 in tanks with an \neffective volume of 60 L. The main zootechnical parameters were analyzed about the experimental diets (Weight gain \n(WG-mg); daily weight gain (DWG-mg); length gain (LG-mm). Daily gain in length (DGL-mm), feed conversion (FC), \nconsumption (C, mg/day/larva), specific growth rate (SGR), condition factor (K) and survival (S%)). The results of the \nzootechnical parameters indicate that the best diet was significantly 45% CP when compared to the other CP levels used \n(Table 1). In the mean comparison tests between weight gain (GP) and % CP, the polynomial regression model determines \nthat the probable protein requirement for this stage corresponds to 48.5% CP  (Figure 1).\n51\nFEED EFFECTORS IN SOY OPTIMIZED DIETS: PASSIVE ACOUSTICS FROM THE \nLABORATORY TO THE POND\nSamuel Walsh, Leila Strebel, Khanh Nguyen, Melanie Rhodes, Silvio Peixoto, and D Allen Davis*\nSchool of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Aquatic Sciences\nAuburn University, AL, 36849\ndavisda@auburn.edu\nPassive acoustics monitoring (PAM) can contribute to improve feed formulations by providing information on shrimp \nfeeding behavior or it can be used as a tool to manage feed inputs. Under laboratory conditions, we have utilized PAM \nto identify feed modifiers that act as chemoattractants, feeding incitants, and stimulants in plant-based feed formulations. \nBased on laboratory results we formulated an \u201call plant\u201d basal diet (AP) and three AP diets supplemented with 2% krill \nmeal (AP+KM), 2% squid meal (AP+Sq), or 4% fish hydrolysate (AP+FH). These diets were then tested in the laboratory \nto evaluate the response of the shrimp, in research ponds using automatic feeders equipped with acoustic feed management \n(AQ1) as well as outdoor tanks where feed inputs were controlled. In the laboratory, the acoustic feeding activity was \nmonitored by hydrophones connected to a multitrack recorder (16 bit/192 kHz), while feed consumption (FC) (g) was \nmeasured as the amount of food eaten by the shrimp (n=10) in each aquarium over a 30 min period. The clicks produced \nby shrimp during feeding activity were automatically detected and quantified using specific acoustic targets. These data \nwere also used to calculate the relationships between the number of clicks and FC. An overall improvement was observed \nin acoustic feeding activity and FC for all-plant diets with attractants in comparison with the basal diet, confirming an \nimprovement in feeding response in the laboratory. To confirm the efficacy in the field, the same feeds were offered \nto shrimp (30 shrimp/m2) reared in 0.1 ha research ponds each equipped with AQ1 acoustic feeders which allowed for \ndemand-style feeding. The growth and general health of shrimp were monitored via weekly sampling and final production \nvalues were determined after fully harvesting each pond. Harvest was delayed due to a hurricane, which in combination \nwith multiple blue green algae blooms, led to shrimp mortalities. As a result of low survival, some ponds were excluded \nfrom the final data set.  No statistically significant differences were found between the treatments for any major production \nparameter apart from feed input and feed cost (Table 1). Significantly more of the AP+FH diet was offered to shrimp in the \nrespective ponds than that of the basal diet, suggesting that fish hydrolysate increases the intensity of the feed response in \nPacific white shrimp in semi-intensive pond culture.\n52\nTEXTURE PROFILE ANALYSIS OF COLLAGEN EXTRACT FROM Octopus maya \nL.

This \ncephalopodred in color and has a pair of spots under its eyes, it reaches up to 100 cm with a short lifespan of approximately \na year. In 2019, almost 12,000 tons were caught, with annual revenues of 360 million pesos which represented 15,000 direct \njobs. O. maya is commercialized without its mantle (MA) and tentacle\u2019s ends (TE), which are removed to obtain visually \nattractive products. However, research is being carried out to create products of high value from these wastes, ensuring the \nsustainable use and exploitation of O. maya . This is the case of obtaining collagen from mayan octopus wastes (MA and \nTE) which can be used in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.\nCollagen is a structural protein considered the most abundant, it\u2019s found in tissues such as skin and tendons, but also in \nbones and gristles. Due to its high protein content and its functional properties, collagen is highly demanded in the food \nindustry as a gelling agent, emulsifier in food industry and drug delivery systems, with a wide range of applications such \nas cell scaffolding, moisturizer agent, etc. In southeast unit of CIATEJ a collagen extract has been obtained from O. \nmaya  which is being characterized. The determination of texture profile analysis (TPA) will allow to infer its quality as \na biomaterial and gelling agent. TPA in collagen samples (moisture=97.65 %) was performed with a texturometer (EZ-\nSX, Shimadzu). A penetration test was carried out with a 15 mm plate in a cylindric container with a diameter of 25 mm. \nA downward compression polarity speed of 2 mm/s with a displacement limit of 15 mm/s was used in both compression \ncycles and determining the parameters of hardness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, adhesive force and gumminess. Samples \nshowed a slight hardness of 0.31 N in collagen extracts from O. maya (Table 1),  which is less than collagen from pork \n(14.6 N) 6.67% (w/v), also the samples exhibited slight adhesive force and gumminess with no adhesiveness (0 N), while \nextracted collagen from pig reported 13.17 N (Fig. 1) this may be due to a higher moisture content in the octopus\u2019 samples. \nIt\u2019s recommended to increase collagen concentration in the samples as well as to continue evaluating its textural but also \nits viscoelastic and flow behavior in to infer potential applications in the industry . \n53\nFEASIBILITY STUDY OF AN AQUAPONIC POLYCULTURE TILAPIA-CATFISH AND \nLETTUCE-CHARD\nJes\u00fas Josafat De Le\u00f3n-Ram\u00edrez*, Samuel L\u00f3pez-Tejeida, Leticia F\u00e9lix-Cuencas, Sergio Alonso Mart\u00ednez-Ramos, \nJuan Fernando Garc\u00eda-Trejo\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Quer\u00e9taro, Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda, Cerro de las Campanas s/n Col.

However, there are still some \nchallenges to overcome, these derived from the complexity of integrating its biological components; which still limits \ncrop productivity. Likewise, studies of aquaponic systems have focused on establishing the relationships between fish and \nplants that allow the highest growth rates; however, the option of linking more than one aquatic and plant species in each \nproduction cycle has not been explored. Therefore, the objective of this work is to determine the feasibility of implementing \nan aquaponic polyculture with tilapia-catfish and lettuce-chard.\nThe feasibility of implementing a coupled aquaponic polyculture was determined; evaluating the growth of specimens of \ntilapia, catfish, lettuce and chard. The polyculture worked for 60 days with three treatments: T1 (system with 40 tilapia, 20 \nlettuce and 20 chard), T2 (system with 40 catfish, 20 lettuce and 20 chard) and T3 (system with 20 tilapia, 20 catfish, 20 \nlettuce and 20 chard). \nThe water was monitored in the variables of temperature, \ndissolved oxygen; as well as the concentrations of \nphosphate, nitrates, nitrites and non-ionized ammonia. \nLikewise, biometric data monitoring of fish and plants \nwas carried out. During the 60 days of experimentation, \nthe variables monitored in the water were within the \nranges required for tilapia and catfish farming (Table 1). \nDiscarding the influence of water quality as a limiting \nfactor in fish growth. However, the differences between \ntreatments place T3 with the highest concentration of \nnitrates; which is related to the greater growth of the \nplants in said treatment. \nThe fish with the highest growth and survival rate \nwere those present in T1 (Table 2); however, this is \nnot related to the growth of the plants, which in this \ntreatment ended with low growth rates. On the contrary, \nT3 with a fish growth rate lower than T1 presents the \nhighest growth rates for lettuce (Table 3) and Swiss \nchard (Table 4).\nThe study provides information that allows considering \nthe implementation of aquaponic systems coupled with \npolyculture modality; this with the objective not only \nof generating food but also diversifying its production.\n54\nTHE COMPLETE MITOGENOME OF LION\u2019S PAW SCALLOP Nodipecten subnodosus  AN \nSPECIES WITH AQUACULTURAL POTENTIAL\nMiguel A.

Guasave, Sinaloa, M\u00e9xico\ngdiarte@ipn.mx* \nShrimp farming is considered a fundamental activity in food security programs in many countries. White shrimp \n(Litopenaeus vannamei ) is one of the most cultivated species worldwide. One of the alternatives to reduce the problem of \ndiseases caused by vibrios and increase sustainability in the aquaculture sector is the use of probiotic bacteria.\nTherefore, the objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the growth, survival and immune system challenged with \nVibrio parahaemolyticus  IPNGVE 16 in L. vannamei . 50 \u00b5L of B. licheniformis  were inoculated in 100 mL of trypticasein \nsoy broth at 2.5% NaCl and the culture was incubated for 72h at 32\u00baC. The microcapsules of B. licheniformis  were obtained \nby the spray-drying method using maltodextrin (15%) as an enveloping material, which were added to commercial feed as \nan additive. Shrimp ( L. vannamei ) were collected in commercial postlarvae laboratories in the state of Sinaloa.\nThe shrimp were transported to the CIIDIR-IPN Aquaculture Laboratory. Shrimp of 40-60 mg were used in tubs (20 L) with \n10 L of filtered seawater (20 \u00b5m), at 30 \u2030 salinity, constant aeration and fed twice a day. The bioassay lasted 36 d and consisted \nof 4 treatments (triplicate), I): Negative control, Commercial feed (AC); II): AC + microencapsulated B. licheniformis  \n(1.0 g/kg of food), III): AC + microencapsulated B. licheniformis  (2.0 g/kg of food), IV): AC + microencapsulated B. \nlicheniformis  (3.0 g/kg feed). For the expression of the immune system, the activity of prophenoloxidase, intracellular \nsuperoxide anion concentration and hemocyte count were determined.\nThe LD50 was 780,000 CFU/mL. Regarding growth, it was observed that the TII (2.08 \u00b1 0.083g) presented the highest \ngrowth with respect to the control (1.94 \u00b10.083 g), there were no significant differences (P > 0.05). Survival after challenge \nwith V. parahaemolitycus  was: Control (52.38%), TII (47.61%), TIII (76.19%) and TIV (76.19%). Being the TIII and TIV \nwhere the highest survival was presented (Fig. 1).\nFor the hemocyte count, TI (positive control) was presented with 2.039 x 106 \u00b1 0.31 x 106 hemocytes/mL, T II with 1.84 \nx 106 \u00b1 0.17 x 106 hemocytes/mL, T III with 1.72 x 106 \u00b1 0.22 x 106 hemocytes/mL, T IV with 1.49 x106 \u00b1 0.30 x 106 \nhemocytes/mL.\nThe generation of intracellular superoxide anion, the activity of prophenoloxidase and phenoloxidase in the treatments did \nnot present significant differences between the treatments with respect to the control (P > 0.05).\n57\nEFFECT OF OXYTETRACYCLINE ON THE INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA OF  L. vannamei \nUNDER PRODUCTIVE CONDITIONS\nKatherine D\u00edaz Riquelme\nDoctorate in Aquaculture, Cooperative Program  \nUniversidad de Chile, Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Norte, Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Valpara\u00edso\nInstitute of Nutrition and Food Technology, Universidad de Chile\nkatherinedzr@gmail.com\n\\In a L. vannamei  farm located located in the \ncoastal area of the Gulf of California, 109 \nkm from Hermosillo (Sonora, Mexico), two \ngroups of ponds geographically separated \nwere selected, during a semi-intensive \nproduction cycle of approximately 6 \nmonths. After around 70 days, an infectious \noutbreak affected the production, which \nwas diagnosed as AHPND(+) for one of the \nponds studied. Oxytetracycline was applied \nthrough feed throughout the farm (5kg/\nton), which was carried out in each group \naccording to their culture days. Those sown \nfirst and whose desired harvest size was \nlarger (green) received the antibiotic before \nthose who were sown later and whose target \nharvest size was smaller (yellow) (Fig. 1).\nAt four times, intestinal samples were \ncollected, which were subjected to \nanalysis of the V3-V4 region of the 16s \nrRNA gene. The results were as follows: \nthe infection period coincides with the \ndecrease in Proteobacteria  and the increase \nin Tenericutes , being represented mainly \nby Vibrio  and Candidatus  Bacilloplasma, \nrespectively. The statistically significant \ndecrease in the latter was possibly due to \ntreatment with Oxytetracycline, while \nVibrio  had no major changes. The abundance \nof Fusobacteria  increased significantly \nin the group that was sampled three days \nafter the end of antibiotic treatment, and its \nlevel was negatively related to the presence \nof Tenericutes . However, at this sampling \ntime only two genera of Fusobacteria  were \ndetected, and these did not exceed 0.5% \nrelative abundance. These results raise \nnew questions regarding the dynamics of \nbacterial groups that cannot yet be identified \nwith next generation sequencing.\n58\nCHARACTERIZATION OF BACTERIAL MICROBIOTA ASSOCIATED WITH HISTAMINE-\nCONTAMINATED SARDINES USING NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCIG (NGS)\nDelano D. Schleder*, Luca Frondana, Mayara Pavan, Dgeofrei J. B.

There are \nnumerous studies identifying microbes that form histamine in fish meet by plating methods, however, to our knowledge, \nno study has demonstrated which bacterial group(s) are of greatest importance for the formation of histamine in sardines \nby NGS so far. Thus, this study aimed to characterize the bacterial microbiota associated with histamine-contaminated \nsardines using NGS, as an attempt to identify the main causes behind it and help the industry to develop strategies to  \navoid it.\nThe regulations of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture determines \nthat batches of fresh fish with histamine concentration >100 ppm \nmust be discarded. Therefore, this study separated samples in two \ngroups: contaminated, batches with histamine \u2265 200ppm; and non-\ncontaminated, batches free of histamine (< 1ppm). These batches \nwere from the same supplier, fishing areas and fishing/processing \ndates. Sample collection took place at the company GDC S/A, \nlocated in Itaja\u00ed-SC, Brazil. Five samples (10g) of each batch group \nwere collected and submitted to NGS (quintuplicate). The sequences \nwere processed and grouped into operational taxonomic units \n(OTUs) for identification and, finally, used to determine the relative \nabundance and for alpha and beta diversity analyses. Generalized \nunivariate linear models were used to identify differences in the \nOTUs relative abundances (p<0.05) between contaminated and \nnon-contaminated samples. \nEighteen OTUs were identified in total. Alpha diversity analysis \nrevealed that contaminated samples showed higher bacterial \nrichness but lower diversity than non-contamined. Beta diversity \nanalysis confirmed that both groups showed different microbial \ncomposition (Figure 1). Bacteria with optimal growth under \nmesophilia and commonly associated with fish decomposition, such \nas Shewanella  ssp. and Photobacterium  ssp., were more abundant \nin the contaminated samples than in the non-contaminated ones \n(p<0.05), while psychotropic bacteria unrelated to spoilage, such \nas Psychrobacter  ssp. and Pseudoalteromonas  ssp. had higher relative abundance in samples without histamine (p<0.05). \nTherefore, the analyses of the microbiota structure and composition of both samples suggest that samples with histamine \nconcentration \u2265 200ppm was handled differently from those without histamine, probably the cold chain was not correctly \napplied from the time of fishing to freezing and sending to the slaughter plant.\nFunding: GDC Alimentos S/A\n59\nIMPROVING MANAGEMENT OF SIZE HETEROGENEITY AND MINIMUM MARKET \nSIZES IN TILAPIA CULTURE\nRoger Dom\u00ednguez-May* y Patricia Borrego-Kim \nCentro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional Unidad M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, M\u00e9x\nroger.dominguez@cinvestav.mx\nSize heterogeneity and minimum market sizes are two aspects that can improve the economics of a farm.

Results were compared using a mean growth model and quantile \nregressions, respectively.\nGrowth data from a pilot tilapia farm in the state of Yucatan were used. Parameterization of the growth models was \nperformed in R, using the nls and quantreg packages. The quantiles = 0.025, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.85, 0.95 \nand 0.975 were considered. Days to harvest were considered as 180, 195, 210 and 225, while the minimum market sizes \n(MMS) were 350, 400, 450 and 500 g.\nThe economic results using an average growth model and under a fixed price of USD$ 2.24 per kg, regardless of the MMR, \nis negative in both HT and HM planting strategies. With variable price, the highest net profit in HM was generated in the \nharvest strategy (day 225,500g) with USD$ 5,061.91 and USD$ 5,220.53 in HT. While the lowest net profit in HM was \nfound in the harvest strategy (day 180, 450g) with USD$ 1637.53 and USD$ 1,714.54 in HT , respectively.\nUnder quantile regression analysis, and lowered a fixed price, the harvest strategy (day 225, 350g) showed higher yields in \nHM and HT with USD$ 4,323.51 and USD$ 4,190.90, while the lowest, for both planting strategies in that order, was in \n(day 210, 500g) with USD$ 708.38 and USD$ 1,175.56, respectively .\nConsidering a variable price, the harvest strategy (day 225,450g) showed higher yields in HM and HT with USD$ 8,634.03 \nand USD$ 8,983.26, while the lowest, for both planting strategies in that order, was in (day 210, 350g) with USD$ 3,788.77 \nand USD$ 3,580.18, respectively.\n60\nNannochloropsis sp.

Initially, the \ndigestibility of the microalgae meal was assessed, and the apparent digestibility coefficient (APC) was determined. The \nAPC was, in general, high in lipids (78.88%) and eicosapentaenoic fatty acid (73.86%). Then, Nannochloropsis  spp. were \nincluded in diets at four levels (0, 0.5, 1 and 2% inclusion). The shrimp were reared in 500 L clear water tanks containing 20 \nshrimp per tank with initial weight of 6.05 \u00b1 0.06 g and fed four times a day. Shrimp fed with supplemented diets containing \nNannochloropsis  spp. (0.5 and 2%) presented higher resistance to thermal shock when compared to the non-supplemented \ngroup (Figure 1). Shrimp fed with 1 and 2% of algae inclusion had higher production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) \nwhen compared to other treatments. No statistical difference was observed in immunological parameters and microbiology \nof the intestinal tract. Thus, the inclusion of Nannochloropsis  spp. in shrimp diets at 0.5% and 2% levels increase resistance \nto thermal shock and ROS production in shrimp.\nFinancial support: CAPES (Financing code 001) and by the Aquavitae project (Horizon 2020, number 818173\n61\nINFLUENCE OF CONVENTIONAL AND ADV ANCED EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES ON \nPOLYSACCHARIDE YIELD, CHEMICAL STRUCTURE, MOLECULAR PROPERTIES \nAND ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY FROM ALGAE Fucus virsoides  AND Cystoseira barbata\nAna Dobrin\u010di\u0107, Verica Dragovi\u0107-Uzelac*, Sandra Pedisi\u0107, Zoran Zori\u0107, Mladenka Jurin, Marin Roje, \nRozelindra \u010co\u017e-Rakovac\nFaculty of Food Technology and Biotechnoloy \nUniversity of Zagreb \nPierottijeva 6, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia\nvdragov@pbf.hr \nFucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide from brown algae, exhibits a wide range of biological activities that depend on its \nchemical structure and are closely correlated with the extraction technique used.

The aim of this study was to extract polysaccharides from the brown algae Fucus virsoides  and Cystoseira \nbarbata  using 5 different extraction techniques (CE, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), pressurised liquid extraction \n(PLE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and non-thermal plasma (NTP)) under previously defined optimal conditions. \nThe influence of these techniques on polysaccharide yield (%PS), chemical structure (fucose, sulfate groups, uronic acids), \nmolecular properties (weight average molecular weight (Mw), number average molecular weight (Mn), polydispersity index \n(PDI)) and antioxidant capacity (ORAC) was studied. \nThe highest %PS for both algae was obtained with PLE and the lowest with NTP. The highest antioxidant capacity was \nobtained with MAE, while UAE had the highest Mw and, together with NTP, the highest sulfate group content and the \nlowest concentration of uronic acids.

For this purpose, the effects of two \nproduction systems (clear water and BFT) and two diets (with and without astaxanthin supplementation) were evaluated in \na completely randomized 2X2 factorial design.\nGoldfish juveniles (12.18\u00b10.27  g) were divided into 24 experimental aquariums (15 L). Fish were fed twice a day (2% of \nbody weight per day) with isoproteic (40  %) and isoenergetic (4250kcal.kg-1) diets for 56 days. Asthaxanthin was used as \na carotenoid source (80 mg.kg-1). At the end of the experiment zootechnical performance indexes and pigment intensity \n(portable colorimeter) of the skin were evaluated. \nThere was no interaction between the systems and the diets (P>0.05) for any of the performance or skin pigmentation \nvariables. No effect (P>0.05) on goldfish performance was observed (Table I). The cultivation in BFT system improved \n(P<0,05) the pigmentation of goldfish skin in relation to the clear water system (Table II). Carotenoid supplementation \nintensified fish pigmentation regardless of the culture system used.\nCultivation in the BFT system improves the goldfish skin pigmentation when compared to the clear water system. These \nresults prove that the BFT system is an effective and promising technology for goldfish production. The BFT system \npromotes pigmentation but it can be intensified with exogenous sources. \n63\nMIXED CULTURE MICRORGANISMS FERMENTATION AFFECTS SOYBEAN \nMEAL NUTRITIONAL CARACTERISTICS AND IMPROVES THE INTESTINAL \nMORPHOMETRY OF NILE TILAPIA Oreochromis niloticus JUVENILES REARED IN BFT \nSYSTEM RECEIVING PLANT-BASED DIETS\nT.E.H.P.

After 54 days of the experiment the intestinal \nmorphometry was evaluated.\nThe soybean meal fermentation increased lactic acid bacteria and yeast counts (Table I). A reduction in pH was observed \nin the FSBM and there was also an increase in soluble protein. In animals fed 21% and 28% FSBM diets, higher (P<0.0,5) \nvilli height were observed compared to the other treatments (Figure I).  In the inclusion of 28% of FSBM, the goblet cell \ncount did not differ from the positive control, but it was higher compared to the other treatments. \nThe utilization of a mixed microbial culture increased the probiotic microorganisms count and improved nutritional \ncharacteristics of FSBM. In the inclusions above 21% of FSBM, there was also evidence of improvement in the intestinal \nhealth of Nile tilapia juveniles.\n64\nFERMENTATION OF SOYBEAN MEAL WITH Lactobacillus acidophillus  ALLOWS \nGREATER INCLUSION OF PLANT PROTEIN AND REDUCES Vibrionacea  BACTERIA IN \nTHE INTESTINE OF SOUTH AMERICAN CATFISH Rhamdia quelen\nT.E.H.P.

The experimental design was completely randomized in a 2x3 factorial scheme with four replications.\nThe enzyme complex consists of a combination of amylase, xylanase, beta glucanase, beta mannanase and protease. All \ndiets were isoprotein (32% CP) and isoenergetic (4100 kcal GE/kg). Fish meal were used as a animal protein source, and \nsoybean meal was the main ingredient in the plant based diet. Nile tilapia juveniles (approximately 5,25\u00b10,22 of initial \nweight) were distributed in 24 tanks (70 L) at a density of ten fish per tank. The tanks were connected to a recirculation \nsystem equipped with heating and aeration. After 90 days of the experiment the zootechnical performance was evaluated.\nNo interaction (P>0.05) was found between the factors for any evaluated parameter. Regarding the source of protein, diets \ncontaining animal protein improved (P<0.05) the growth, feed ingestion and feed efficiency compared evaluated when \ncompared to plant based diets. The higher inclusion of the enzymatic complex increased (P<0.05) the growth and feed \ningestion, Survival was not affected(P>0.05) by the treatments.\nFrom the results it can be concluded that the protein sources affects the zootecnical performance of Nile tilapia juveniles. \nSupplementation with enzymatic complex improved growth and feed intake. The weight gain response was proportional to \nthe level of enzyme supplementation.\n66\nGELLING TEMPERATURE OF ENDEMIC MAYAN OCTOPUS (Octopus maya) MUSCLE \nOF THREE LOCATIONS OF YUCATAN \n \nIsabel Elizondo-de la Fuente*, M.

Even though Octopus vulgaris is the most common \noctopus\u2019 species worldwide, 74 % of the octopuses captured on the Yucatan peninsula are O. maya. One of the most \nimportant aspects for handling octopus is the gelling temperature that is directly related to its cooking temperature since, \nwhen cooked at the wrong conditions, their meat becomes tough, compromising the consumer\u2019s acceptance. The cooking \ntemperature of mollusks ranges from 55-60 \u00b0C, but there is scarce information about the one of octopuses. Therefore, the \nobject of this work was to determine the gelling temperature of O. maya muscle and study the changes on its structure based \non its viscosity and location.  \n \nSamples were made by blending three octopuses \ninto a paste, each from different ports of Yucatan \n(Coloradas CL, Rio Lagartos RL and Cuyo CU). \nThe rheological behavior of the octopus\u2019 paste \nwas characterized using a rheometer (DHR2, TA \nInstruments; EE.UU.) with a plate-plate geometry \n(40 mm) and a 1,050 mm gap. The samples were \nallowed to rest at the rheometer for 5 min/25 \u00b0C \nbefore the analysis; a vapor trap was attached \nto the geometry to reduce water evaporation. \nTemperature ramps were run on the samples over \nthe range 25 - 90 \u00b0C (rate= 5 \u00baC/min; shear rate= \n2 s-1). j \nThe temperature ramps showed that all three \nsamples had a similar temperature at which their \nviscosity started to raise (Figure 1 Table 1) with \nno statistically significant difference, as well as \nthe final temperature. The viscosity of the samples \nvaried (CL 2562, RL 729 and CU 491 Pa \u00b7s), \nbeing the octopus from CL statistically significant \ndifferent from the others. This could be caused by \nthe location, for the environment feed or for the lack \nof control on the age of capture of the octopuses. \nBy the change of the samples viscosity, it can be \ninferred that internal structure modifications, that \ncan be associated to its cooking temperature, take \nplace.  Figure 1. Temperature ramp for octopuses\u00b4 \nsamples. \nThe range of gelling temperatures obtained (51-68.8 \u00b0C) were slightly different to the cooking temperature range reported \nfor mollusks (55-60 \u00b0C). O. maya needed higher temperatures to reach their maximum viscosity (8.8 \u00b0C). This information \nis of vital importance in heated processes as cooking or making industrial products with octopus. \n67\nEFFECT OF EARLY CO-FEEDING ON THE PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF \nDIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF TOTOABA ( Totoaba macdonaldi ) LARV AE AND JUVENILES\nBrandon Esc\u00e1rcega Miranda*, Mario A.

The production of marine fish larvae depends on the use of live food such as rotifers and Artemia,  among \nothers. This increases the difficulty and complexity for fish production. For these reasons, acceptable growth rates cannot \nbe maintained using solely live food due to the low nutrient content (1). Also, acceptable growth rates cannot be maintained \nusing live feeds exclusively due to the low nutrient content and restricted intake of these feeds (1). On the other hand, \nthe use of microdiets in larviculture can improve the nutrition of the larvae especially in terms of amino acids profile and \nprotein quality, therefore, implementing co-feeding is expected improved the nutritional status of the larvae and could \nfacilitate the transition to only microdiets (2). The objective of the present study was to evaluate co-feeding during the early \ndevelopment of totoaba ( Totoaba macdonaldi ) larvae under culture conditions.\nMethod . Twelve 100-L fiberglass tanks in a recirculating \nsystem were supply at a density of 150 larvae/L. Four \nfeeding treatments were performed (T1, T2, T3 and T4): T1 \nconsisted of using the feeding protocol proposed by (3) and \nT2 doubled the live feed ration according to this protocol. \nT3 consisted of co-feeding with rotifer-microdiet from Day \nPost Hatch (DPH) 4, and T4 was to start co-feeding at DPH \n12 with nauplii of Artemia -microdiet (Figure 1). Larvae \ngrowth (g and cm) and survival were evaluated and the \ndevelopment of the digestive system.\nResults and Discussions. No significant differences \n(P>0.05) were observed on growth, length, and survival. \nThe best growth (g and cm) and survival results were \nobserved in T1 and T2 compared to T3 and T4 (Table 1), \nhowever, regarding the ontogenic development, a better \ndevelopment, larvae quality and conformation of the \ndigestive system was observed in the T3 and T4, therefore, \nbased on these results, we could suggest implementing co-\nfeeding from DPH 12, as an early weaning protocol for \ntotoaba larvae, contributing with a promising strategy for \nthe production of this species.\nConclusions.  Based on the results of the present study, \ntotoaba larvae could be fed with a co-feeding ( Artemia -\nmicrodiet) from DPH 12, having growth rates similar to \nthose reported in previous protocols.\nReferences\n1 Fosse P.

M\u00e9xico\nmelanie.estrada.martinez@gmail.com\nLa acuicultura de peces marinos es una actividad productiva que ha adquirido gran importancia durante las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas; \nsin embargo, su desarrollo enfrenta diversas problem\u00e1ticas. Dentro de las m\u00e1s importantes se encuentran las alteraciones en \nla reproducci\u00f3n durante el cautiverio, sobre todo en las hembras. Para resolver estos problemas, desde hace varias d\u00e9cadas \nse ha recurrido al uso de terapias hormonales en diversas especies. En la actualidad se utilizan an\u00e1logos de la hormona \nliberadora de las gonadotropinas (GnRHa) dado su resistencia a la degradaci\u00f3n enzim\u00e1tica en comparaci\u00f3n con la GnRH \nnativa. Sin embargo, aunque existen implantes para la liberaci\u00f3n de GnRHa en peces, estos no son \u00fatiles para todas las \nespecies de importancia comercial y los protocolos de preparaci\u00f3n no son claros para su replicaci\u00f3n en campo, lo que \nhace necesario el desarrollo de nuevos protocolos claramente descritos. El presente estudio tuvo como objetivo describir y \ncomparar el perfil de liberaci\u00f3n de GnRHa de implantes preparados con diferentes excipientes en pruebas in vitro : 1) 95% \ncolesterol m/m, 5% celulosa m/m; 2) 1.5% alginato de sodio m/v-- metil \u00e9ter metacrilato de polietil\u00e9nglicol (PEGMA) v/v \ncubierto con etilvinilacetato (EV Ac) m/m-inulina m/m, y 3) EV Ac m/m.  La cuantificaci\u00f3n de la GnRHa liberada se hizo \ncon el m\u00e9todo del \u00e1cido bicincon\u00ednico (BCA). No se encontraron diferencias significativas en la magnitud de liberaci\u00f3n \ntipo estallido entre los implantes de alginato y los de colesterol-celulosa, sin embargo, esta liberaci\u00f3n se registr\u00f3 a las 6 y \n48 h, respectivamente. El porcentaje acumulado liberado fue significativamente mayor (62.1%, p=0.003) en los implantes \nde alginato. Los implantes de colesterol-celulosa liberaron por 192 h, mientras que los de alginato liberaron por 72 h \n(Figura 1). La cuantificaci\u00f3n de GnRHa liberada de los implantes de EV Ac no fue precisa debido a que el m\u00e9todo no era \nespec\u00edfico para GnRHa, sin embargo, se detectaron las prote\u00ednas liberadas hasta las 336 h despu\u00e9s del inicio del ensayo \n(Figura 2). Finalmente, los implantes de 95% colesterol y EV Ac resultaron con perfiles de liberaci\u00f3n de GnRHa m\u00e1s \nprolongados comparados con el perfil de liberaci\u00f3n de implantes de alginato, sin embargo, dado el potencial del alginato \ncomo excipiente, es conveniente continuar su evaluaci\u00f3n incorporando otros componentes y coberturas para retrasar la \nliberaci\u00f3n de compuestos activos.\n69\nSEASONAL V ARIATION OF AMINO ACIDS AND FATTY ACID COMPOSITION OF \nA POLYCHAETA Abarenicola pusilla AND ITS POSSIBLE USE AS AN ADDITIVE IN \nAQUACULTURE FEEDS \nA.

Los Pinos s/n Balneario Pelluco, Puerto Montt, Chile\nafarias@uach.cl\nThis study aims to provide a quantitative analysis of amino acids (AA) and fatty acids (FA) on samples of the Abarenicola \npusilla  Polychaeta, taken at different seasons along the year, and under three types of processing (eviscerated carcass, \npressed cake, and the liquid remaining). \nThe results showed a clear seasonal difference, where essential nutrients significantly decreased in the winter.  Regarding \nthe essential fatty acids, the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) resulted in a relationship close to \n1. In comparison, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was absent in some extracts during winter. At the same time, the highest \nprotein values were observed in the spring and summer, while crude lipid values were the same, indicating that A. pusilla  \nuses AAs more efficiently as energy source than lipids. Also, a significantly higher amount of free amino acids, essential \n(EAA) and non-essential (NEAA), were presented in winter. \nThe Polychaeta press cake was the product with the highest quality in terms of protein content and AA and FA composition, \nbeing a good source of functional amino acids LYS, GLU, GLY , ALA, and HIS. Also, the Polychaeta press cake would be \na good source of EFA, such as EPA and ARA.\nFinally, the conditions under which Polychaeta could be harvest and the type of extract recommended to produce a valuable \nadditive for marine aquafeeds are also discussed. It is also proposed to study the culture possibilities into the integrated \nmultitrophic aquaculture providing them the best possible conditions as spring and summer when the highest and most \nvaluable nutrients are encountered.70\nEFFECT OF CO-SUPPLY WILD JUVENILE CRABS TO ENRICHED Artemia AS FOOD FOR \nTHE PATAGONIAN RED OCTOPUS ( Enteroctopus megalocyathus ) PARALARV AE FROM \nDAY 15 TO 50 AFTER HATCHING UNDER CONTROLLED CULTURE CONDITIONS\nIker Uriarte1a, Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez1a, Viviana Espinoza1a, Alex Romero2a, Mar\u00eda Teresa Viana3a, Ana Far\u00edas1a*\n1 Hatchery de Invertebrados Marinos, Instituto de Acuicultura, Sede Puerto Montt, Universidad Austral de Chile, \nPuerto Montt, Chile\n2 Laboratorio de Inmunolog\u00eda y Estr\u00e9s de Organismos Acu\u00e1ticos, Instituto de Patolog\u00eda Animal, Universidad \nAustral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile\n3 Instituto de Investigaciones Oceanol\u00f3gicas, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California, Ensenada, Baja \nCalifornia, M\u00e9xico\na INLARVI (Interdisciplinary network of advanced research for marine larviculture of species with complex life \ncycle)\nOne of the most sensitive problems in the Patagonian red octopus ( Enteroctopus megalocyathus ) aquaculture, is the high \nmortality of paralarvae. Paralarvae are active hunters being highly selective until they reach the juvenile stage, around 90 \nto 120 days after hatching (DAH). Artemia  is the food provided to paralarvae, with enrichment practices to provide better \nnutrients like essential amino acids and fatty acids.\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the mortality preventive effect of diet in paralarvae between 15 and 50 \nDAH (i.e. from the maternal reserves have been depleted until the time before the benthic settlement) both through using \njuvenile crabs to co-feeding and varying diet of the previous feeding period. The growth, biochemical composition, and \nthe expression of genes related with fatty acid biosynthesis, antioxidant defense system and stress response in paralarvae \nwere evaluated after a experimental period of 35 days. To obtain paralarvae of 15 DAH two diets were used: only enriched \nArtemia  (A), or enriched Artemia  plus crab (AC), when paralarvae reached 15 DAH, each group was divided in two \nnew groups that were fed until 50 DAH with enriched Artemia  with or without co-feeding with crabs. Treatment names \nindicated the diet before and after 15 DAH, as follows: A-A, A-AC, AC-A, and AC-AC. \nNo differences were detected in weight growth, whereas those paralarvae fed A-A and AC-A, resulted in longer length. \nOn the contrary, the highest survival was observed with both groups fed with crab juveniles at initial diet, with 40.5% for \nAC-AC, followed by AC-A with 34.8%, far higher than those A-A and A-AC (9.5 and 16.2%, respectively). Also, a trend \ntowards a higher value in AL/ML ratio, highest values of 18:0, and the absence of 20:4n-6, were observed in paralarvae fed \nA-AC and AC-AC, without effect of the initial diet and without interaction between the diets of both periods. Of the genes \nanalyzed, only the expression of the stress protein HsP70 showed a trend to higher values in paralarvae fed in the A-A the \nsame with the highest mortality. It is discussed how co-feeding with juvenile crab resulting in an improvement compared \nto the use of pure enriched Artemia .\nFundings: FONDECYT 120066871\nSEA CUCUMBER AQUACULTURE IN LATIN AMERICA AND CARIBBEAN (LAC), \nPROBLEMS, PROSPECTS, AND FUTURE\nLuis Felaco1*, Arlenie Rogers2, Miguel A.

This increases the \nimportance of its development and diversification. The LAC region has the potential for a substantial expansion in SC \nfarming. To this end, some efforts have been made with limited success. This work explores recent advances with the \nleading commercial local species ( Isostichopus badionotus and Holothuria sp. ), compiling regional experiences for more \nthan ten years, with historical, societal, institutional, and private background, identifying the main problems and providing \noptions to solve them, suggesting future goals, objectives, and guidance. \nWith the interest from buyers in I. badionotus, H. mexicana  and H. floridana fisheries, aquaculture research started in \nthe Yucatan peninsula and expanded to countries like Colombia, Bermuda, Belize, Panama, and other. The private sector \nfollowed the institutions and startup ventures in Belize and Panama initiated. At each level, various problems have arisen, \ngetting most projects to a halt.\nBiological and environmental:  Proper SC broodstock for aquaculture is scarce. It is challenging to keep them in captivity \nfor a long time thereby limiting their reproductive potential for culture purposes. For these species, there are substantial \ninformation gaps about the nutritional requirements, diseases, parasites, and improving farming technologies for their \ngrowth and survival. Additionally, they face fishing and environmental pressures in the wild. More R&D and sustainable \nproduction methods like integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMT A) are required.\nSocial: SC aquaculture faces the same social misconceptions as other aquaculture species: competition for coastal space, \nthe perception of pollution, and conflicts with the fishery. There is a scarce specialized workforce for these activities, and, \nin some countries, security is a concern. New production efforts require community training and generation of simple low-\ntech for remote areas.  \nPolicy: In many LAC countries, there is little to no institutional support for aquaculture, and yet, a highly complicated \nbureaucracy or no regulatory framework. It is critical to educate key decision-makers about sustainable mariculture, \nincluding IMTA approaches with sea cucumbers as the basis and their integration in the blue economy. \nPrivate sector: Many of the stakeholders ignore SC aquaculture profitability potential. At the same time, some have hired \nconsultants from other regions without the required knowledge of local species and ecosystems, generating the perception \nof high risk, making them prefer other investments. Promising, simple, cheap technologies and procedures should generate \nmore interest. \nConclusion\nSea cucumber aquaculture could be one of the main economic and societal drivers for many LAC countries. However, a \ngroundwork multi-disciplinary approach is needed involving every stakeholder in an organized and conscientious manner. 72\nEFFECT OF TEMPERATURE AND CULTURE DENSITY ON THE GROWTH AND \nNUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF TILAPIA ( Oreochromis niloticus ) IN RAS\nLeticia F\u00e9lix-Cuencas*, Juan Fernando Garc\u00eda-Trejo, Samuel L\u00f3pez-Tejeida, Jes\u00fas Josafat De Le\u00f3n-Ram\u00edrez, \nClaudia Guti\u00e9rrez-Antonio\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Quer\u00e9taro, Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda, Cerro de las Campanas s/n Col.

Among these options based on aquaculture, it can be mentioned recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). \nStudies regarding stocking densities of tilapia crops have been carried out in RAS; those studies shows that in intensive \ncrops, physical variables such as water temperature influence the growth of the fish, but also affected the quality of the meat \nproduced. Previous research have not reported the effect of these variables on intensive crops, considering the maximum \ncultivation capacity for tilapia without sacrificing production or product quality. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine \nthe optimal conditions of stocking density and water temperature to obtain the highest levels of growth and nutritional meet \nquality of tilapia in a recirculating aquaculture system.\nOptimal conditions to obtain the highest growth levels and nutritional quality on tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ) in a \nrecirculating aquaculture system were evaluated. During 60 days, fish were cultivated considering three cultivation densities \n(67, 135 and 270 fishes/m3) and water with and without temperature control (28 \u00b0C and environmental temperature). Water \nquality was measured through the determination of temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen. Biometric data were registered \nthroughout the growth of fish, along with the determination of moisture, total ash, total lipids and protein on tilapia fillet. \nResults showed that temperature and stocking density did not impact on survival rate of tilapia fish; however, specific \ngrowth rate for the farmed fish was higher at 28 \u00b0C (Table 1). In addition, higher moisture percentage values   were observed \nin tilapia fillet cultivated at 28 \u00b0C; while, those fillet obtained from cultivation at room temperature showed percentage \nhigher values   of ash and total fat. There was no significant difference between the treatments respect to percentage of \ntotal ashes and protein (Table 2). Treatments with the lowest density, with and without temperature control, presented \nthe greatest significant difference in percentage of total fats. Overall, according to the results a culture with a density of \n270 fish/m3 (equivalent to 80 kg/m3) to harvest of tilapia can be carried out without affecting the growth and quality of \nproduct, as long as there was a control system for physical conditions of the fish culture, such as temperature at 28 \u00b0C and \noxygenation, main\n73\nCIRCULATING ncRNAs IN BLOOD PLASMA FROM RAINBOW TROUT ( Oncorhynchus \nmykiss ): INTEGRATIVE BIOMARKERS IN FISH NUTRITION.\nIgnacio Fern\u00e1ndez*, F\u00e1tima de Vicente, Francisco J.

Ar\u00e9valo, 40196 \nZamarramala, Segovia, Spain\nEmail: fermonig@itacyl.es\nAmong other factors, nutrition is one of the most determining factors in fish farming, representing 40\u201370% of the production \ncosts and determining survival, growth potential and quality of fish. The proper development of nutritionally balanced \ndiets relies on multifactorial and multidisciplinary studies to fulfill species- and stage-specific nutritional requirements. \nHowever, since each nutrient might have different roles (and requirements) depending on the tissue and biological process \nconsidered, the use of integrative biomarkers as hall mark of the global condition of farmed fish might be a powerful tool to \nimprove feed formulation and fish physiology monitoring. Here, the use of circulating non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) found \nin blood plasma from rainbow trout ( O. mykiss ) as integrative biomarkers was explored.\nWe studied the population of miRNAs as biomarkers of fish physiology when they were fed with diets formulated base on \ndifferent alternative raw materials during > 60 days or under feeding/fasting conditions during 10 days or (Experiment 2).\nIn Exp. 1, miRNAs were isolated from 12 (6 from fish fed on diets containing fish meal (FM) and 6 from FM devoid diets) \nsamples, while in Exp. 2 we studied 8 (4 from fed and 4 from unfed fish) samples, using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit. \nLibrary preparation was performed using < 100 ng of ncRNA, normalized and sequenced in an Illumina platform (single-\nend, 51 cycles).\nRaw reads were bioinformatically processed and mapped/annotated against Salmo salar  known miRNAs from miRBase \nv22.1/RNAcentral 14.0 databases. Novel miRNAs were predicted with miRDeep2 using USDA_OmykA_1.1 genome as \nreference. SnoRNAs, rRNAs and tRNAs were also found. An example of the output from Exp. 1 is presented in Table 1.\nWe will list the identified miRNAs being found differentially expressed in both experiments and the potential molecular \npathways post-transcriptionally regulated by them.

European countries (among others) also depends on the production of soybean meal (SBM) from third countries. \nHere we will review the research works conducted to explore the potential use of Narbonne vetch (Vicia narbonensis) meal \n(NVM) as a substitute of SBM in rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) diets.\nThe evaluation of NVM in rainbow trout diets was developed \nin 3 research phases. In phase 1, the effects of the inclusion \nof NVM at 0%, 10% and 30% (C, A10 and A30, respectively) \nin diets (isoproteic 43%, isolipidic 18%) was explored. In \nphase 2, the substitution of SBM with 0% 33% and 66% \nof NVM was evaluated under pre-treated conditions with \nthe exogenous enzyme rovabio \u00ae phytase or  not in diets \n(C, A33, A33E, A66, and A66E, respectively; isoprotein \n42%, isolipidic 18%). Both experiments were carried out \nin RAS units with 500 L tanks, with a daily feed intake of \n3% and during a 63-days trial. In phase 3, the underlying \nmechanisms of the effects of SBM substitution by NVM \nwere explored through the assessment of digestive enzyme \nactivities (proteases, \u03b1-amylase, alkaline phosphatase), blood \nbiochemistry (glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, among \nothers) and the quantification of the expression of genes \ninvolved in glucose metabolism.\nWe first reported that NVM can be safely included at 10% in \nrainbow trout diets (Fig. 1A); since 30% inclusion induced \ngrowth reduction and impaired status on the proximal \nintestine (Fig. 1B). Afterwards, we demonstrated that a 33% \nof SBM can be replaced by NVM when is pre-treated with \nthe exogenous enzyme (Fig. 1C).\nAltogether suggest that a 33% substitution of SBM by NVM \ncan be used for rainbow trout diets when it was pre-treated \nwith an exogenous enzyme. \nAcknowledgments:  This work was partially funded by \u201cOptimizaci\u00f3n integral de los sistemas productivos en acuicultura: \nrevalorizaci\u00f3n de materias primas locales en piensos y en cr\u00eda de especies en potencial desarrollo (OPTI-ACUA)\u201d project \nfrom the European Regional Development Funds (ERDF).

Ar\u00e9valo, 40196 Zamarramala, Segovia, Spain\nAquaculture \u00b4s sustainability  deeply relies on the identification \nand implementation of alternative raw materials (ARMs) to \nreplace fish meal and oil. One of the main ARMs currently \nused in fish diets is soybean meal (SBM) that in some regions \n(e.g. Europe) has to be imported. Thus, the identification of \nlocally produced crops to substitute SBM is an urgent need to \nreduce not only the dependency of SBM from third countries, \nbut also to reduce the carbon footprint. Here a nutritional \ndose-response trial was performed to explore the use of red \nvetchling ( Lathyrus cicera ) meal (RVM)  in rainbow trout \n(Oncorhynchus mykiss ) diets.\nA 90-day feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects \nof different substitution levels (0 %, 8%, 16%, 33%, 66% and \n100%, named as C, T8, T16, T33, T66 and T100, respectively; \nisonitrogenous 42% and isolipidic 18%, diets) of SBM with \nRVM on growth, and feed utilization of juvenile rainbow \ntrout. A total of 360 juvenile fish of 10 \u00b1 0.5 g maintained \nunder controlled parameters (temperature of 15 \u00b0 C, dissolved \noxygen > 7 mg/L, etc.) in 500 L tanks connected to a RAS \nunit (20 fish/tank) were hand-fed at a daily ration of 3% body \nweight. \nPreliminary results presented here, obtained after 42 days \nfeeding, indicate significant lower values for wet weight, WG, SGR and FCR only in those fish fed on the highest substitution \n(ANOV A, p> 0.05; Table 1). Although growth performances, as well as other parameters like the histopathological status of \nthe digestive system (liver, proximal and distal intestines), blood biochemistry (glucose and triglyceride\u2019s plasma content) \nand muscle quality (proximal composition, amino acid and fatty acids profiles) will be assessed again at the end of the \nexperimental period.\nThese results suggest that SBM could be partially replaced up to 66% by red vetchling meal in rainbow trout feeds.\nAcknowledgments:  This work was partially funded by \u201cOptimizaci\u00f3n integral de los sistemas productivos en acuicultura: \nrevalorizaci\u00f3n de materias primas locales en piensos y en cr\u00eda de especies en potencial desarrollo (OPTI-ACUA)\u201d project \nfrom the European Regional Development Funds (ERDF).

Garza-Torres1, F.J. Magall\u00f3n-Bajaras\n*Consejo Sudcaliforniano de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (COSCYT)\n1 Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste, Unidad Nayarit (UNCIBNOR), S.C., La Paz, B.C.S., M\u00e9xico\nEmail:yefimbres@gmail.com\nDecoupled aquaponics is a strategy that allows combining the culture of animals and plants in a disruptive way. These \nsystems present several advantages in using water, space, and residuals. In the same line, Biofloc technology (BFT) has \nshown to be a beneficial technique implemented in this production activity. It represents low-cost equipment and a versatile \nway to transform aquaculture waste into valuable products used in horticulture. Despite the favorable attributes of BFT, the \ntypical combination was heterotrophic BFT and aquaponic, but the description of the strategies for integrated aquaponics \nand photoautotrophic BFT with Chlorella microalgae has not been completely explained. Diversifying the production \nsystem is a necessity in developing countries, which is why this investigation focus on the characterization of residuals from \nO. niloticus  BFT in a photoautotrophic, heterotrophic, and control, and their relationship and strategies implemented to \nintegrate these residuals with the NFT hydroponic horticulture using five green leaf plant species: lettuce  (Lactuca sativa ), \npak-choi ( Brassica rapa subsp . chinensis ), rocket ( Eruca sativa ), spinach ( Spinacia oleracea ), and basil  (Ocium basilicum ). \nThis experiment was performed in five weeks; it evaluated plant growth, production, parameters, the size, elements content \nin biofloc, and the diverse strategies to integrate these residuals (mineralization, flocculation, and filtration). During the \nexperimental period, the photoautotrophic treatments showed the highest levels of micro and macronutrients among all \ntreatments. According to growth percentage, lettuce and pak-choi did not show significant differences (p > 0.05), while for \nbasil and spinach, the best results were obtained with photoautotrophic treatment  (p < 0.05). The best combination was \nwith spinach and/or pak-choi and/or lettuce. The relationship between N:P was suitable in the photoautotrophic treatments \ncompared with hydroponic solutions. The ideal integration process was the combination of flocculation and filtration \nbefore adding the liquid fraction from BFT to NFT system. The aerobic-anaerobic reactor allows the attaining of essential \nmicronutrients.\nTherefore,  O. niloticus  BFT rearing in the photoautotrophic mode and its integration with decoupled aquaponics system \nis beneficial in arid coastal zones where water is scarce. It is necessary to improve aquaculture performance, reuse water, \nBFT nutrients, and increase profits.  \n77\nCOUPLING TECHNOLOGIES IN TILAPIA FARMING AT CIBNOR\u00b4S NAYARIT UNIT\nFimbres-Acedo, Y .E., Garza-Torres, R., Telles, A., Carrera-Alvarado, G.  & Maeda-Mart\u00ednez, A.N.\nUnidad Nayarit del Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste, S.C., (UNCIBNOR+). Tepic \nNayarit, M\u00e9xico \nUnidad Nayarit del Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste (UNCIBNOR) (Fig. 1) continues to consolidate \nitself as a center for technological development and innovation in Tilapia. Its facilities have been in continuous operation \nfor more than three and a half years. In the period that has elapsed, the Unit continues to have a significant influence on the \nTilapia value chain in Western Mexico by being depositories and distributors of one of the best genetic lines of Tilapia in \nthe world, with operations in the facilities of our laboratory, dedicated to the production of offspring and juveniles of this \nspecies with Biofloc technology (BFT).\nWith this, it has been possible to provide the raw material required by aquaculturists, producers, and fishers organized in \ncooperative societies and rural production societies in western Mexico (Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoac\u00e1n), Guerrero, Campeche, \nHidalgo, Sinaloa, Zacatecas, and Baja California Sur, where the demand for our product has been increasing. Since the \nbeginning of the Unit\u2019s operations, it has managed to sell approximately a little more than 15 million male tilapia hatchlings. \nSupporting more than one hundred producers, considering that UNCIBNOR continues to consolidate itself in this area and \nis the key to the development of the tilapia production industry in our country .\nIn addition, the advisory and technical assistance actions demanded by the producers have continued to increase, as well as \nthe development of demonstration projects of the different existing technological alternatives for the production of tilapia. \nIn the same way, in this period, the task of training students from regional higher education institutions has been increasing \nto contribute to the training of professional and technical staff required by aquaculture and fishing in our country. The \npersonnel commissioned by Conacyt to UNCIBNOR have been working on integrating research proposals focused mainly \non the optimization of farming techniques, the development of assisted tilapia fisheries in natural and artificial reservoirs, \nand the transfer of farming technologies to vulnerable groups in Mexico.\n78\nTHE CURRENT SITUATION AND CHALLENGES OF THE ABALONE FARMING \nINDUSTRY IN MEXICO\nRoberto Flores-Aguilar*, Matias Arjona, Claudia Carrillo and Edith Ochoa\nAbulones Cultivados\nEr\u00e9ndira B.C. M\u00e9xico 22904\nrobfloresaguilar@gmail.com\n \nAbalone are one of the most luxurious and expensive seafood products around the world, with high demand \nspecifically in the Asian countries because of the cultural, traditional, and medicinal qualities associated with \nabalone. Abalone aquaculture over the last decade has increased its share of the world abalone market with the \ndecline of abalone fisheries. Abalone culture technology is now well established in several countries, and the \nindustry can be considered to be in its maturation phase.\nThe total volume of worldwide  abalone  fisheries  has declined  since the 1970\u2019s, but over the same period, farm production \nhas increased from negligible quantities in the 1970s to more than 100,000 tons, the vast majority being produced in China \nand South Korea.\nOther relevant abalone producing countries are South Africa, Chile, Australia, USA and Mexico.  \nIn Mexico, the annual abalone cultured production has been stable, less than 100  tons. The number of new entrants also \nhave been stable for the past two decades.\n \nThis presentation gives an overview of the development of the Mexican abalone industry. It discusses options and challenges \nfor expanding and to sustain the abalone industry in Mexico.79\nCRYOPRESERV ATION OF GONADAL TISSUE OF WHITE SNOOK Centropomus viridis\nGalilea Fonseca-Gonz\u00e1lez*, Carmen G Paniagua-Ch\u00e1vez, Marisela Aguilar-Ju\u00e1rez\nCentro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y de Educaci\u00f3n Superior de Ensenada, B.C.\nDepartment of Aquaculture\nEnsenada, B.C. M\u00e9xico 22860\ngjfonseca@cicese.edu.mx  \nThe white snook Centropomus viridis  is one of the main artisanal \nfisheries in the Gulf of Mexico with high farming potential. In 2018, the \nfarming of white snook was successfully achieved in Mazatlan, Mexico. \nHowever, its aqu aculture production is still limited due to a lack of \nbiological and ecological information. Therefore, the cryopreservation \nof germ cells will contribute to developing assisted reproduction \ntechniques to optimize white snook farming and production. Also, \ngerm cells\u2019 cryopreservation will help conserve it since C. viridis  is \nconsidered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s red \nlist as a species of minor concern.\nThus, the objective of this work was to develop a cryopreservation \nprotocol for gonadal tissue of white snook. Pieces of gonadal tissue \nwere suspended in Ethylene glycol (1.5 M or 2 M), Dimethyl sulfoxide \n(1.5 M or 2 M), or the combination of Dimethyl sulfoxide 1.5 M with \nthe addition of lactose (0.1 M or 0.2 M), and 10% egg yolk. Then, \nsamples were cooled at -80\u00b0C for 10, 15, or 30 minutes and plunged into \nliquid nitrogen (-196\u00b0C). Gonadal tissue was thawed, enzymatically \ndissociated with 0.25% trypsin, and germ cells enriched using a Percoll \ndensity gradient (40% and 10%). Cell viability will be determined with \ndouble staining of fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide. The \nidentification of germ cells will be made by immunohistochemistry \ntechnique using the protein V ASA as a molecular marker. The results \nwill be presented at the meeting.\n80\nEFFECT OF DIETARY PROTEIN, LIPID AND CARBOHYDRATE RATIO ON GROWTH, \nDIGESTIVE AND ANTIOXIDANT ENZYME ACTIVITIES OF FRESHWATER PRAWN \nMacrobrachium acanthurus JUVENILES\nSusana A.

De los Barrios, Los Reyes Ixtacala, \nTlalnepantla, MEX\nsfrias92@hotmail.com\nFreshwater prawn Macrobrachium acanthurus is an American native species suitable for aquaculture. The present \ninvestigation was conducted to evaluate the effect of two levels of protein and three lipid to carbohydrate ratios on growth, \ndigestive and antioxidant enzyme activities and thus contribute to the formulation of feeds that improve health and growth \nof juveniles.\n180 juveniles (initial weight of 70.4 mg) were randomly \nstocked in 18 tanks with a water recirculation system. \nSix treatments were formulated with two levels of \nprotein (35 and 40%) and three combinations of lipids \n(L) and carbohydrates (C) to a ratio of 2:1 (L= 15% \nand C= 8%), 1:2 (L= 10% and C= 20%) and 1:6 (L= \n5% and C= 30%) in a 2x3 factorial design. Treatments \nwere tested by triplicate and prawns were fed twice a \nday for 8 weeks. Length and weight were measured \nbimonthly for growth calculations. Homogenates of \njuveniles cephalotorax were prepared at the end of the \nfeeding trial for assaying digestive and antioxidant \nenzyme activities. Data was tested for normality and \nhomoscedasticity before running a 2 way ANOV A \nusing GraphPad Prism v.8.0.2 software.\nJuveniles fed with 35% of protein and a 1:6 L:C ratio \nattained the highest weight (330.4 mg). Protease \nactivity was higher with 40% of dietary protein \nassociated to the increased amount of substrate (Figure \n1). Amilase activity decreased significantly with the 1:6 \nL:C ratio, suggesting that 30% exceeded carbohydrate \nrequirements affecting digestibility. Total antioxidant \ncapacity was highest with P35 and L:C ratio 1:2, and a \nratio of 1:6 increased phenoloxidase, prophenoloxidase \nand catalase to a peak (Figure 2), suggesting oxidative \nstress. Results evidence that a diet containing 35% of \ncrude protein, 10% of lipids and 20% of carbohydrates \n(L:C ratio 1:2) helps to improve health and growth in \njuveniles of M. acanthurus.\n81\nASSESSMENT OF PROBIOTIC BACTERIA FROM MARINE COASTS AGAINST ACUTE \nHEPATOPANCREATIC NECROSIS DISEASE (AHPND) \nLucio Galaviz-Silva*, Jos\u00e9 C.

This work aimed to isolate the best bacterial \nstrains from Mexican marine ecosystems to assess the \nmicrobiota antagonism against VPAHPND and to choose \nstrains with protective roles against this pathogen for an \nenvironmentally friendly aquaculture treatment. \nBacterial marine agar and trypticase soy agar isolates \nwere obtained from invertebrates and different Sonora \ncoast ecosystems. Sampled and reisolated pathogens \nwere analysed by qPCR. Among 258 bacterial isolates, \nonly 17 showed antagonist activity in vitro , but only \nfive, 32a, 43, H-A, Y119, and Y100, were chosen based \non cell-free supernatant assays (Fig. 1). Bioassay results \nwith white shrimp highlighted Vibrio alginolyticus- 32a \nwith a 4.76% cumulative mortality, followed by Bacillus \npumilus -Y100 (12.54%) and Vibrio campbellii -H-A \n(16%); Bacillus pumilus -Y119 and Bacillus pumilus- 43 \ndid not show any protection or beneficial effect against \nVPAHPND (Fig. 2). Pathogen reisolation on CHROMagar \nVibrio and qPCR were performed only in the positive \ncontrol and H-A; however, 32a, Y100, Y119, 43, and \na negative control yielded creamy pink and green-blue \ncolonies based on the absence of VPAHPND, which was \nconfirmed with a negative qPCR (Fig. 3). This result \nsuggested that they were able to inhibit the pathogen \nwith a microbicidal effect.\n82\nSILAGE FISH WASTE AS A CULTURE MEDIUM FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE \nMICROALGAE Tetraselmis chuii\nPedro Gallardo*, Patricia Balam, Ener Figueroa & Gabriela Palomino\nUnidad Multidisciplinaria de docencia e investigaci\u00f3n \u2013 Sisal,  Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional \nAut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico\n*ppge@ciencias.unam.mx\nThe microalgae Tetraselmis chuii  is part of the live foods \nused in the larval rearing of fish, crustaceans and molluscs. \nIts nutritional quality is closely related to culture media, \nwith F/2 Guillard being the most widely used in aquaculture \nproduction centers. Fish waste silage can be an important \nalternative to commercial culture media as it contains high \nnutrient contents. In this study, the effect of partial and total \nreplacement of the F/2 Guillard by chemical ensilage of fish \nwaste on the growth of the microalgae T. chuii  was evaluated.\nFish waste from the \u201ccanan\u00e9\u201d snapper ( Ocyurus chrysurus ) \nobtained from riverside fishermen from the port of Sisal, \nYucatan, Mexico, was used. After being homogenized, formic \nacid was added at a ratio of 20 ml kg (v/p) and the initial pH \nand during the 30-day silage was recorded (Gallardo et al, \n2012). The silage was carried out in triplicate using containers \nof 2 liters capacity.\nTwo bioassays of partial and total replacement of the F/2 \nGuillard medium were carried out, evaluating the population \ngrowth of T.chuii  for 10 days under controlled conditions \nwith 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. In the first experiment, \nseawater was fertilized at the beginning of the bioassay prior \nto inoculation. In the second bioassay, the silage was added \non both day 0 and day 3 (Table 1).\nA maximum value of concentration of T. chuii  was observed \non day 5 with treatments CT, A and B whose average value \nof 1.3 x 10-6 was much higher than that obtained when \nonly the silage was used (0.5 x 106) (Fig. 1a). The results \nof experiment 2 show that the silage was beneficial for the \ngrowth of microalgae, allowing concentrations similar to \nthose obtained with the commercial medium (Fig.1b).\nLiterature\nGallardo P., \u2026., and Sotelo A. 2012.

In recent years, the use of semi-moist and dry feeds have allowed high \nsurvival and growth rates (Mart\u00ednez et al 2014, Gallardo et al, 2020). The selection of inputs, as well as the conditions of \nthe food preparation process have been decisive for obtaining the pelleted feed, for which in this work the results obtained \nfrom 3 experiments carried out with different diets elaborated with fish discards ( Haemulon plumieri ). A control diet based \non a mixture of squid and crab (Gallardo et al, 2020) was used. \nFor each experiment, newly hatched organisms from a single spawn (0.1 g ww) were used. The fish discards were \nhomogenized and incorporated into a mixture with vitamins, minerals and gelatin as a binder. Three different protein \nhydrolysates made with discarded fish (\u201cchac chi\u201d, \u201ccanane\u201d Ocyurus chrysurus ) and crab ( Callinectes spp ) were tested, \nwhich were incorporated into the diets for each of the experiments. The pellets (0.5 cm) were fed (3 times day-1) for 90 \ndays.\nThe survival and growth rates obtained in the three experiments were similar to those observed with the control diet (mean \n65 % and 4.5 % day-1 respectively) (p>0.05). With the weight values obtained up to 90 days (average of 16.5 g), a growth \nprojection was made, which shows that the octopuses can reach a size greater than 60 g in 150 days after hatching (Fig. 1). \nThe results obtained indicate that fish discards added with the different proteic hydrolysates can be a good alternative for \nthe development of food for octopus farming.\nReferences\nGallardo P.*, ..., and Rodriguez S. 2020.

A periphyton-based system is a strategy to increase fish farming efficiency, reducing feed use and effluent \ndisposal.\nThis study aimed to evaluate different types of feeding restriction management in periphyton-based systems to produce \nNile tilapia in ponds. To do this, two new production models were compared: (P100-0) Nile tilapia fed 100% of the \nrecommended amount of feed sharing effluent with a tilapia production in a periphyton-based system with no feed input, \nand (P50-0) Nile tilapia fed 50% of feed plus periphyton sharing effluent with a tilapia production in a periphyton-based \nsystem with no feed input. \nBiomass gain and productivity were significantly higher in P100-0 than in P50-0, and no differences in the feed conversion \nratio and survival were found. For both production models, fish fed with feed and periphyton-based fed corresponded, \nrespectively, to 75% and 25% of the total productivity of each model. The tilapia growth performance indicates that the \nproposed production models are promising strategies for using natural food in a periphyton-based system and reusing \neffluents from monocultures, especially when inputting a high amount of nutrients as in P100-0.\n86\nFISH FEED DEVELOPMENT USING BLACK SOLDIER FLY AND MICROALGAE AS \nTOTAL FISHMEAL REPLACEMENT FOR TILAPIA CULTURE\nJ. Fernando Garc\u00eda*, M. Vanessa Oviedo, M. Isabel Nieto and Benito Parra\nBioengineering Laboratory, Engineering Faculty \nAutonomous University of Queretaro\nChichimequillas km. 1, Amazcala, El Marqu\u00e9s, Quer\u00e9taro, M\u00e9xico\nfernando.garcia@uaq.mx\nFishmeal is consider the main protein source in fish feed, that is why the high demand has affected its production and costs \nfor aquafeeds development, questioning meal supply for the next years. Currently, there is a need to find new alternative \ninputs to replace fishmeal without affecting the benefits that the latter provides to fish nutrition. Between the most relevant \noptions are black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) and microalgae due to its protein, lipids, vitamins, minerals and antioxidant \ncontent; they had been used as partial replacements of fishmeal with favorable results on fish growth performance, however, \nthey had not been used successfully as total fishmeal replacement and neither combined in the same formulation. Therefore, \nthe objective of this study was to develop a balanced fish feed with BSFL and microalgae according to the nutritional \nrequirements of Nile tilapia fry.\nThree isoproteic (45%) diets were formulated with 5, 10 y 15% of BSFL and 5% of microalgae Nannochloropsis limnetica ; \nadditionally, experimental diets were balanced with animal and vegetal meals as corn, soybean, wheat gluten, wheat bran \nand meat and bone meal (Table 1). All diets were mixed, pelletized and dried in an oven at 60\u00b0C for 24 hours. Feeding trials \nwere conducted for 7 weeks in a recirculation system conformed with tanks of 12 liters, controlled culture conditions of \noxygen (5 mg/L), temperature (28\u00b0C) and water quality recirculated through an external filter with chemical and mechanical \nagents. Each tank contained 30 fish of the specie Oreochromis niloticus  (1\u00b15 g) and each experimental diet was assigned \nto triplicate tanks. The experimental diets were compared with a commercial feed. \nAfter 45 days, all experimental diets were well accepted by the fish. Figure 1 shows initial and final weight obtained \nduring the experiment. Fish fed with Diet 3, which contained 15% of BSFL, resulted in a weight increased with significant \ndifference ( p<0.05) compared with the other alternative diets. Based on these results, the combination of BSFL at 15% \nof the diet with 5% of microalgae can be used as a total fishmeal replacement without causing unfavorable effects on fish \ngrowth. \n87\nV ARIATIONS ON DIGESTIVE ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY OF THE LONGARM RIVER \nPRAWN Macrobrachium tenellum ADAPTED FROM THE WILD TO CULTURE WITH \nPREPARED MEALS\nMarcelo Garc\u00eda-Guerrero*, Rodolfo De los Santos Romero, Alfonso \u00c1lvarez-Gonz\u00e1lez, Emyr Pe\u00f1a-Mar\u00edn, \nEdilmar Cortes Jacinto \n*Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional\nUnidad Oaxaca (CIIDIR-IPN)\nCalle Hornos 1003, Santa Cruz Xoxocotl\u00e1n \nOaxaca, Mexico\nprawnaquaculture@gmail.com\nmgarciagu@ipn.mx\nMacrobrachium  tenellum  is an omnivorous freshwater  prawn living in rivers near the coast and in coastal lagoons with \npotential to be cultured.  Since they are capable of living in rivers, estuaries and coastal lagoons, in each of these they \nhave access to foods with different nutritional content. In this work, it has been tested if this has an immediate effect on \ntheir digestive enzymatic activity once they are brought to laboratory-controlled conditions. Wild prawns were captured \nin a river and in a coastal lagoon. After acclimation, they were fed with three different dietary regimes consisting on 1) \ncommercial pelletized food (Camaronina Purina\u00ae) with 35% protein, 2) prepared pelletized food with 35% protein and 3) \nmixture of fresh tilapia and squid flesh. \nTotal alkaline protease, trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase and \u03b1 amylase were measured from wild specimens and from \nspecimens kept 15 and 30 days with the experimental diets. \nPrawns collected from the wild had more intense enzymatic activity in comparison with those maintained in the laboratory \nwith different diets on all enzymes. However, the proportion in which these enzymes are expressed in the prawns from \nthe different treatments remains proportional to what was observed in wild specimens. We consider that the study of this \nphenomenon can contribute to a better understanding of the nutritional needs of this species if a species-specific diet needs \nto be prepared.88\nEL POLICULTIVO LANGOSTINO-TILAPIA, UNA OPCI\u00d3N VIABLE PARA LA \nPRODUCCI\u00d3N DE  Macrobrachium rosenbergii EN M\u00c9XICO\nAlejandra Ivonne Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1nchez*, Alberto Asiain-Hoyos, Juan Lorenzo Reta-Mendiola, \nDiego Esteban Platas-Rosado, Adri\u00e1n Argumedo-Mac\u00edas, H\u00e9ctor Chalate-Molina\n*Colegio de Postgraduados - Campus Veracruz\nCarretera Xalapa-Veracruz km 88.5\nTepetates, municipio de Manlio Fabio Altamirano\nVeracruz.

Sin embargo, es una especie estudiada \ny domesticada que se cultiva con gran \u00e9xito en diversas partes del mundo, por lo que el desarrollo del cultivo es una \nalternativa para satisfacer la demanda y disminuir la presi\u00f3n que la pesca ejerce sobre los recursos naturales silvestres.

However, a high SBM content causes enteritis, the non-contagious \nsubacute inflammation of the intestine, which also result in immune and physiological changes that in turn alter the \nabsorption of nutrients and growth of some fish, such as totoaba. The totoaba is an endangered endemic fish from the Gulf \nof Baja California with a high potential for aquaculture.\nOn the other hand, prebiotics can prevent enteritis caused by SBM. \nThese ingredients have the characteristic to be resistant to digestion and \nstimulate gut microbiota. Macroalgae contain polysaccharides that meet the \ncharacteristics of prebiotics, however, their effects are species-specific, so \nthe aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of macroalgae in grow-\nout diets on the growth performance of juvenile totoaba, feed utilization, \ndigestibility of the diets, body composition, enzyme activities (trypsin, \nlipase, amylase), immune responses (respiratory burst and leukocyte count), \nhistological changes and gene expression ( il8, aqp8 , IgM). Four isoproteic \n(48%) and isolipidic (13%) diets were tested. Two commercial diets with \nlocal macroalgae meal (Alg1 and 2) and two experimental diets, both with \n26% of SBM and one including a macroalgae prebiotic mix (SBM and \nSBM+Pre).\nAt the end of the trial fish fed with SBM and SBM+Pre diets resulted a \nsignificant higher growth and utilization of nutrients compared to the diets \nwith macroalgae. Also, significant differences were found between the \ntreatments in the histological samples of the distal intestine. There was \nexpression of genes related to the immune system such Igm and il8, and cell \nstructure such as aqp8 , but only SMB+Pre had a lower level than the other \ntreatments.\nThese results reveal that the commercial diets negatively affected the gut \nhealth of totoabas even more than diets that included SBM, however more \nresearch is needed to elucidate which compounds of these diets altered the \ngut and make clear if there is a prebiotic effect of the macroalgae on other \nspecies.\n90\nEFFECT OF LOW AND HIGH SALINITY ON IN VITRO AND IN VIVO  PROTEIN \nDIGESTIBILITY, GROWTH PERFORMANCE, FEED UTILIZATION AND SURVIV AL \nOF PRACTICAL FEED INGREDIENTS FOR WHITELEG SHRIMP Litopenaeus vannamei \nJUVENILES\nAlvaro F Barreto-Altamiranoa, Gabriela Gaxiolab, Jes\u00fas T Ponce-Palafoxa,c*, Milton Spanopoulos-Hernandezd, \nMart\u00edn A.

The ingredients used for the study were: fish meal (FM), squid meal (SQM), soybean meal (SBM), canola meal \n(CM), poultry by-product meal (PBM), meat and bone meal (MBM), horn and hoof meal (HHM), blood meal (BM) and \ncasein (CA), and a reference diet (RD). In vitro  and in vivo  studies were conducted using the methods of the pH-stat with \nshrimp hepatopancreas enzymes, and zeolite was included as a marker, respectively. Results from both methods showed \nthat the RD diet was the highest apparent protein digestibility. In low salinity, they were PBM and MBM diets and in high \nsalinity, SBM, CM, PBM and MBM diets. The most significant relationship between apparent digestibility coefficients \nand growth performance was with the thermal growth coefficient parameter. There was greater growth in all diets in high \nsalinity than in low salinity. 91\nPARTIAL SUBSTITUTION OF FROZEN-FRESH FOOD BY AN EXPERIMENTAL DIET IN \nLitopenaeus vannamei (Boone, 1931) (Decapoda: Dendrobranchiata: Penaeidae) BROODSTOCK\nSara Ortiz-Guill\u00e9na, Eden Maga\u00f1a-Gallegosb, Miguel Ar\u00e9valoc, Gerard Cuzonc and Gabriela Gaxiolac*\naPosgrado en Ciencias del Mar y Limnolog\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico; Av.

During a 40-day period, three dietary treatments were tested on Litopeaneus vannamei  \nbroodstock. As part of the first dietary treatment, denoted as \u201cFF\u201d, broodstock shrimp were fed only fresh frozen food (squid, \npolychaete, mussel and Artemia  biomass). The second treatment denoted as \u201cED\u201d was 100 % an artificial experimental \ndiet. The third treatment, denoted as MD, comprised both the experimental diet and the fresh-frozen food (only squid \nand mussel were used). In terms of fertile spawns, females with \u2265 1 spawn, females with \u2265 2 spawn, and fecundity, the \nMD treatment did not differ significantly from the FF treatment. Fecundity was lowest among females receiving the ED \ntreatment. MD treatment demonstrated equivalent fertility in females, and sperm rate in males to that of the FF treatment. \nThe highest normal sperm rate was found in the ED and MD treatments.  As a result, a combination of fresh food and the \nexperimental diet resulted in a more balanced reproduction performance.92\nDOES UNILATERAL EYESTALK ABLATION AND CULTURE SYSTEM ORIGIN AFFECT \nPENAEID SHRIMP REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE AND PROGENY QUALITY?\nGabriela Gaxiola*, Ed\u00e9n Maga\u00f1a-Gallegos, Miguel Ar\u00e9valo, Gerard Cuzon \nUnidad Multidisciplinaria de Docencia e Investigaci\u00f3n de Sisal, Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM\nFor almost five decades, the unilateral eyestalk ablation (hereafter named ablation) has been used to accelerate the gonadal \nmaturation of broodstock females from several species of penaeid shrimp (e.g., Penaeus, Litopenaeus and Farfantepenaeus \nspecies). And why not, if the ablation results in regular peaks of maturity and spawning, making it easier to plan production \nschedules in hatchery facilities. However, there is growing public and animal welfare concern about this procedure, which \nmay result in its prohibition in the future. As a result, there is a need to induce a transition and paradigm shift regarding \nthe employment of this technique. Despite efforts in the literature dating back to the 1980s to leave the shrimp to mature \nnaturally, the findings were contradictory. However, broodstock management has evolved over time, and significant strides \nin broodstock output have been made (e.g. diet, pre-maturation culture systems and maturation management). As a result, \nthere is a rising interest in investigating how ablation and broodstock origin - alternative culture procedures  - affect \nreproductive performance and offspring quality. Over the last five years, on a series of experiments, our laboratory has \ninvestigated the effects of ablation and the biofloc system ( vs clear-water) on a native penaeid shrimp species, F . brasiliensis , \nand an exotic species, L. vannamei . According to our findings, ablation increased female mortality in both species. When \nboth species came from clear-water, the quantity of eggs produced by ablated and non-ablated females was comparable, \nhowever evidence suggests that L. vannamei  produced more eggs when it was collected from biofloc. Furthermore, there \nwas substantial evidence that non-ablated females generated higher quality offspring, and this was especially true for \neggs produced by L. vannamei  from biofloc origin. All these findings suggest that both ablation and origin may affect the \nreproductive performance and offspring quality of penaeid shrimp species, and that the lower number of spawning and \npredictability from non-ablated females can be remedied by increasing the number of reproductive females, which can live \nlonger and produce higher-quality offspring. \n93\nFUNDAMENTAL CRITERIA FOR THE SELECTION OF INGREDIENTS FOR FEED \nFORMULATION\nGabriela Gaxiola,  Mart\u00edn Arenas,  Alvaro Barreto  y Juan Carlos Maldonado\nUnidad Multidisplinaria de Docencia de Sisal, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3nma de Mexico\nTo formulate balanced feed for aquatic organisms, it is necessary not only to know the proximal analysis, or the biochemical \ncomposition of the ingredients, but also the digestion potential, using enzyme extracts from the digestive tract (in vitro \ndigestibility), its absorption capacity (apparent digestibility), its assimilation capacity (using direct methods, such as stable \nisotope of C and N) and evaluation methods of energy distribution. In this conference, different results obtained by the \nAquaculture Nutrition Program of the UMDI Sisal, of the Faculty of Sciences of the UNAM, will be presented.94\nINCREMENTO DE LA CALIDAD BIOQU\u00cdMICA DE LA HARINA DE PESCADO \nFERMENTADA CON EL HONGO Aspergillus oryzae\nJuan C.

Por \nello, e l objetivo de este trabajo fue revisar el estado actual de la cadena productiva de Macrobrachium rosenbergii  a nivel \ninternacional.  Se realiz \u00f3 una b\u00fasqueda de literatura enfocada en la cadena productiva de M. rosenbergii . Se consultaron \nlas siguientes bases de datos: Web of Science, EBSCO, Scopus, Scielo, Redalyc, Dimensions y Google Scholar con las \npalabras clave \u201cMacrobrachium rosenbergii\u201d, \u201cproduction chain\u201d y \u201cFreshwater prawn\u201d con una selecci\u00f3n de a\u00f1os del \n2001 al 2022.  Los principales eslabones de la cadena productiva de M. rosenbergii , identificados son: producci\u00f3n de \npostlarva (PL), engorda, transformaci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n. En la producci\u00f3n manejan la compra o la generaci\u00f3n de \nesta, si bien en pa\u00edses con experiencia en el cultivo se desarrolla llegando a generar PL monosexo, es importante divulgar \ntecnolog\u00edas de producci\u00f3n adecuadas para incorporar otras regiones emergentes a la producci\u00f3n mundial. En la engorda, \nlos tipos de cultivo son principalmente intensivos, semi intensivos y extensivos; el cultivo monosexo y la selecci\u00f3n por \ntallas se utilizan para mejorar la homogeneidad. Se emplean tecnolog\u00edas para mantener la calidad del agua para el cultivo \ncomo sistemas de recirculaci\u00f3n de agua, y acuicultura simbi\u00f3tica. Se maneja monocultivo y policultivo especialmente \ncon Oreochromis niloticus . En la transformaci\u00f3n, se encuentra congelado, pelado, cola congelada, sin cabeza y entero \nque es apreciado por la vista en el mercado Gourmet, siendo un car\u00e1cter distintivo. La comercializaci\u00f3n se realiza en el \nmercado local, adem\u00e1s de su exportaci\u00f3n; siendo los principales exportadores China, Tailandia, India y Bangladesh este \n\u00faltimo importa a Estados Unidos, Reino Unido, B\u00e9lgica, Alemania y Jap\u00f3n. En Am\u00e9rica se produce en regiones tropicales \ny subtropicales en pa\u00edses como Brasil, Costa Rica, Per\u00fa y M\u00e9xico. Su consumo puede ser directamente en restaurantes, \ntambi\u00e9n se implementa en festivales gastron\u00f3micos como estrategia de mercadotecnia. Se concluye que, para mejorar la \ncadena productiva de M. rosenbergii , se debe garantizar el suministro de PL, desarrollar mejores pr\u00e1cticas de monocultivo \ny la diversificaci\u00f3n del cultivo con otras especies, as\u00ed como la organizaci\u00f3n de la cadena productiva y los actores directos \ne indirectos que la integran. 97\nPHYSIOLOGICAL AND IMMULOGICAL RESPONSE OF SEA CUCUMBERS: THE \nEFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE AND pH\nEnrique Gonz\u00e1lez-Dur\u00e1n*, \u00c1lvaro Hernandez-Flores, Maren D.

Humberto Lanz \nCardenas y Fraccionamiento Ecol\u00f3gico Ambiental Siglo XXIII, Colonia Ex-hacienda Kala, C.P. 24085, San \nFrancisco de Campeche, Campeche, M\u00e9xico\nSea cucumbers have adopted strategies that lead to the development of hypometabolism and involuntary non-pathological \nresponse. The first occurs by reduction of aerobic scope, which in turn determines physiological responses that generate \ndormancy and aestivation. Involuntary non-pathological responses, such as skin ulceration and evisceration, occurs as \nextreme control mechanisms to seek to reset organismal physiological condition at the expense of anatomical modification. \nIn these organisms, pH and temperature represent two of the most important key factors that produces these responses. \nEvisceration and autotomy, reinforces the hypothesis that the mechanism involved in temperature perception remains \nsimilar throughout the life cycle. The detachment of the sensory fibres of collagen from the body walls suggest that \ncoelomocytes play a greater role in perception. A plausible mechanism that explains how coelomocytes might respond \nto temperature could involve the adjustment of their affinity to Ca+2, which activates transient receptor proteins, an \nimportant kind of membrane protein that constitutes a primary mechanism for detecting heat. With regard to pH, this affect \nantioxidant activity, especially when it is accompanied by changes in temperature. Temperature and pH produce molecular \nand physiological response that generate stress and might influence survival. As seen during aestivation, these parameters \nincreased the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and produce and imbalance in the proportion of antioxidants, \nwhich causes oxidative stress. The response might be regulated through adjustment of electron transport in mitochondria, \nwith production of superoxide anions (O2-\u2022) as minor by-products. As high concentration of ROS modifies protein structure, \nantioxidant enzyme activity regulates their concentration in mitochondria and cytosol. Enzymes such as superoxide (SOD), \nglutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalases (CAT), and thioredoxins-peroxiredoxin (Trx-Prx) participate in the elimination \nof O2-\u2022 by converting it into hydrogen peroxide and water. Some experiment performed with sea cucumbers showed that \nconstant increase of temperature increased the initial SOD activity of the body wall tissues from 45.2 to 128.2 U mg-1 of \nprotein, while the increase of the exposure time to 25\u00b0C for 72h and 168h did not produce significant changes in antioxidant \nactivity. Furthermore, in these organisms, the reduction of pH from 8.1 to 7.7 increase GPx activity of the coelomic fluid. \nAlthough the effect of temperature and pH are important in oxidative stress, few studies have addressed their interaction. \nFrom the publications, the evidence shows that at least in the short term, pH rather than temperature appears to be more \nimportant when antioxidant activity is considered. Here we present a hypothesis that explained the interaction of these \nfactors and resume the main results of the articles that have been addressed for the topic.98\nSOCIAL CHALLENGES AND RESISTANCE TO CHANGE OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS \nIN THE NORTHERN ZONE OF CHIAPAS AND HOW THE INDUSTRY (AQUACULTURE) \nHAS DEVELOPED THE LOCAL ECONOMY\nDaniel Gordillo, Emily McGregor * Cameron MacLean\nCamino Ejidal km 1.5 S/N\nEjido Bajo Amacohite, Ostuac\u00e1n, Chiapas\nM\u00e9xico, CP. 29550\ndaniel.gordillo@regalsprings.com\nChiapas is the poorest state in the country, it is characterized by having an infinity of social problems in all its regions, but \nit is also rich in cultural aspects, nature, climates, water and more; this being one of the reasons why the Regal Springs \ngroup decided to start operations 12 years ago, having the potential to be the main producer of tilapia at the national level, \nand even in LATAM.\nThe initial strategy was to identify the main interest groups around the municipalities where we operate (Ostuac\u00e1n and \nMezcalapa), identify the primary needs, and later create dialogue committees with the communities, fishing cooperatives \nand key stakeholders. At Regal Springs, we also work with all stakeholders in this way so that our operations and the tilapia \nwe produce meet regulatory, sustainability, customer requirements and consumer expectations.\nIn 2018 Regal Springs WE CARE program was born, it aims to produce Naturally Better Tilapia by putting consumer \nneeds first and without compromising sustainability. It is a commitment that is good for the consumer and the communities \nand economies in the countries in which we operate, while respecting the environment and natural resources. Our Regal \nSprings WE CARE Integrated Sustainability Program covers three sustainable development pillars: Environment, Social \nand Economic.\nAnnually our programs benefit more than 60,000 of Mexicans, we have got the Socially Responsible Company Distinctive, \nwhich is granted by the Mexican Center for Philanthropy (CEMEFI), the most important in social issues in LA TAM.\nWe still have some challenges on the environmental, social and cultural side, we mitigate with our 5 CUIDAMOS pillars: \neducation, health, reforestation, lakes & water and infrastructure.\n99\nMORPHOLOGIC AND GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF THE POLYDORID SPECIES \nTHAN AFFECTS Magallana gigas CULTURED IN THE SAN QUINTIN BAY\nGracida-Olivera Ana Leticia1*, Cruz-Flores Roberto1, C\u00e1ceres-Mart\u00ednez Jorge1\nCentro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y de Educaci\u00f3n \nSuperior de Ensenada, (CICESE), Carretera \nEnsenada-Tijuana No. 3918, Zona Playitas\n22860 Ensenada, Baja California, M\u00e9xico\nanaleticia@cicese.edu.mx \nOne of recurrent health problems that effect the culture of the Japanese oyster, Magallana gigas , which is one of the bivalve \nmollusks with the highest aquaculture production at a global scale. Is the infestation by burrowing worms of the family \nSpionidae that have the ability to settle on calcareous shells piercing them and forming tunnels where they take refuge. \nThe hosts become affected when the infestation is high and the worms reach the inner face of the shell. This ultimately \ntriggers a reaction from the host who expedites energy into depositing additional nacreous layers to isolate the polychaete \nto stop it from reaching the soft tissues forming blisters. In such cases that the worm reaches the soft tissues of the hosts, \nit becomes to be more susceptible to bacterial infections. Additionally, severe infestations result in a brittle and unpleasant \naspect of the shell for marketing. In Mexico the production of M. gigas is concentrated in San Quintin Bay and since 1997, \nthe presences of these burrowing worms and the damage that produces in the oyster has been documented: however, his \nidentity has not been confirmed. \nIn this study we carry out a broad sampling of oysters from the Bay and found three different phenotypes of polydorids, \nwhich differ in the pigmentation of the palps. The Whole Genome Sequencing analysis of the most prevalent phenotypes \nshows that the 18S rRNA gene has a similarity of 99.5% whit Boccardiella hamata while mitochondrial genes show \nsimilarities of ranging from 83-89% (Table 1). Conventional taxonomy analysis and ultrastructural studies for describing \ndiscrete morphological features are underway in addition to further next generation sequencing and sanger sequencing \nstudies. Similar analysis will be conducted to the other two phenotypes. This research will help clarify the taxonomic \naffiliation of these burrowing worms and their role in the effect on the shell. Additionally, will aid in the development \nof diagnostic tools to differentiate among possible different species and to provide base line element that contribute to \nmitigate their negative effect on Mexican oyster culture.                                                      \n \n100\nTHE EFFECT OF DISTAL-END TRIMMING ON Saccharina latissima  MORPHOLOGY, \nCOMPOSITION, AND PRODUCTIVITY\nGretchen S. Grebe*, Carrie J. Byron, Damian C. Brady, Adam S. St. Gelais, Barry A. Costa-Pierce\nMarine Biological Laboratory\n7 MBL St\nWoods Hole, MA 02543\nUSA\nggrebe@mbl.edu\nAs kelp cultivation increases around the world, so does the need for farm management strategies that produce specific crop \ncharacteristics, optimize yield, widen harvesting windows, and prevent biomass loss. Distal-end trimming of macroalgae has \nbeen recommended as a farm management method addressing these needs. In this study, we trimmed cultivated Saccharina \nlatissima  sporophytes grown in the Western Gulf of Maine to 60 cm above the stipe-blade interface. We characterized the \neffect of trimming on the morphology, tissue nutrient content, stable isotope ratio, and nitrate reductase activity of the kelp. \nWe also evaluated the economic trade-offs of trimming using a simple production model. \nThe results suggest that trimming the blade to 60 cm may have minimal biological consequences. Additionally, the \ntrimming appears to benefit \u201cshort\u201d kelp blades in proximity to the trimmed blades. Daily yield (% increase in weight \nday-1) after trimming was initially lower than the control, but late-season daily yields and crop-retention following storms \nwere markedly improved. Ultimately, we conclude that growers could use trimming to acquire kelp biomass earlier in the \nseason, retain late-season biomass, and potentially increase the total revenue gained from kelp farming if price premiums \ncan be exacted for this biomass. \n101\nGENETIC CHARACTERIZATION AND EPIZOOTIOLOGY OF RICKETTSIALES-LIKE \nORGANISM ASSOCIATED WITH TISSUE INCLUSIONS OF THE OYSTER Crassostrea \ncorteziensis  IN THE STATE OF NAYARIT\nTeresita Guarneros Mart\u00ednez*, Roberto Cruz Flores, Jorge C\u00e1ceres Mart\u00ednez, Yanet Guerrero Renter\u00eda\nCentro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y de Educaci\u00f3n\nSuperior de Ensenada, (CICESE) Carretera Ensenada-Tijuana No. 3918, Zona Playitas, 22860 Ensenada\nBaja California, M\u00e9xico  \nguarneros@cicese.edu.mx\nIn numerous histopathological studies carried out on several species of bivalve mollusks of commercial aquaculture \nimportance around the world, the presence of characteristic tissue inclusions has been related to Rickettsiales-like organism \n(RLOs). In some records, these RLOs were associated with mass mortalities and tissue damage but not in others. Thus, the \ntype of symbiotic association between the oyster and the bacterium have not been clearly defined. Typically, the studies on \nRLOs are limited to ultrastructural and histological descriptions which are inadequate for a robust taxonomic classification. \nThese RLOs have been observed on the west coast of Mexico in routine health surveys of the pleasure oyster Crassostrea \ncorteziensis  (Figure 1) . In addition to RLOs being the causative agents of the inclusion bodies observed in bivalves, the \ngenus Endozoicomonas  has been recently found to cause very similar inclusion bodies in a wide range of bivalve hosts. \nThe genus Endozoicomonas  has been reported on the west coast of Mexico suggesting the presence of these bacteria in C. \ncorteziensis .\nEmploying histological methodologies in combination with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in situ  hybridization \nand Next generation sequencing (NGS) from DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues we \nattempt to identify and characterize the bacteria observed and causing the inclusion bodies in C. corteziensis.  The NGS \nwas performed from 10 years old FFPE tissues. The sequences were compared using BLASTn and mapped to the partial \nsequence of 16S rRNA for Endozoicomonas sp. In addition, microbiome analysis of the bacterial community associate \nwith C. corteziensis (table 1) showing the tissue inclusions of the RLOs are underway. Histologically, the intracytoplasmic \nvacuoles (Ivs) (figure 1) presented sizes of 15.70-15.24 \u00b5m in length and 15.42-14.95 \u00b5m in width. The prevalence of \nRLOs in the study period was 6% while the infection intensity of the RLOs was grade one in 89% of the infected oysters.\n102\nUSO DE SORGO BICOLOR EXTRUIDO E INTEGRAL COMO ALTERNATIV A PARA \nALIMENTO PARA TILAPIA DEL NILO Oreochromis nil\u00f3ticus , MEDIANTE V ARIABLES \nPRODUCTIV AS Y PLAN DE NEGOCIOS\nL.C.P.

La acuicultura es una de las actividades primarias de gran importancia para la producci\u00f3n de alimentos \ncon prote\u00edna de alta calidad. En las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, ha ido creciendo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido que otros sectores. En el a\u00f1o 2018, la \nproducci\u00f3n mundial de acuicultura incluidas plantas acu\u00e1ticas aportaron 114.5 millones de toneladas de la producci\u00f3n de \nalimento en el mundo, estimadas en un valor de 263, 600 millones de d\u00f3lares.\nEl \u00e9xito del cultivo de tilapia del Nilo O. niloticus  se debe principalmente a su buen desempe\u00f1o en crecimiento, mayor \nrendimiento en alimentaci\u00f3n, adaptaci\u00f3n a diversas fuentes de prote\u00edna, entre otras (CONAPESCA, 2011; Fimbres, 2019). \nSin embargo, la producci\u00f3n no alcanza a cubrir la demanda del mercado nacional. De lo anterior, es importante mencionar \nque, de todos los organismos provenientes de la acuicultura tan solo el 47.25% est\u00e1n representados por los peces cultivados \na nivel mundial, por lo que estos organismos cumplen un papel importante de la seguridad alimentaria en todo el mundo.\nPor otra parte, el elevado costo de producci\u00f3n los sistemas de producci\u00f3n pisc\u00edcola derivado del costo de alimentaci\u00f3n \npueden ser superior al 50% debido a uso de harina de pescado, al igual que carne, sangre y la pasta de soya (Perea-Rom\u00e1n \net al., 2018). Las materias primas antes mencionadas tienen un alto valor nutritivo, buena digestibilidad y palatabilidad, sin \nembrago, son caros y de baja disponibilidad (Civera et al., 2010). Por lo anterior, es necesario buscar fuentes alternativas \nproteicas regionales de bajo costo, pero alto contenido nutricional, con la finalidad de disminuir los costos de producci\u00f3n \n(Perea-Rom\u00e1n et al., 2018). \nDentro de la especie de S. bicolor, la variedad Gavatero-203 de grano rojo tiene mejor calidad bromatol\u00f3gica que los \nh\u00edbridos comerciales en el forraje, adem\u00e1s de 77.3% y 66.4 % de digestibilidad.\n(Continued on next page)103\nEl realizar un estudio del efecto de incluir harina de sorgo integral extruida y no extruida por otras fuentes alternativas \nnutricionales para obtener alimento balanceado que ayude a reducir costos de producci\u00f3n.\nObjetivo general.

Within the lines of research that can contribute to this \nobjective, sexual pheromones are one of those with the greatest potential; \nhowever, although the existence of two types of female sex pheromones in this \norganism (distance and contact) is hypothesized, to date their existence has \nnot been proven. In this work, the detection of the contact female pheromone \ninvolved in the reproductive process of this important specie was carried out \nfor the first time. \nFor this purpose, the behavior presented by sexually mature males against \n\u201cartificial females\u201d previously treated with liposoluble cuticular extracts of \nmature and immature females was observed and classified. The treatments tested \nwere: (1) ventral exoskeleton of immature female (EVHI), (2) dorsolateral \nexoskeleton of immature female (EDHI), (3) ventral exoskeleton of mature \nfemale (EVHM) and (4) dorsolateral exoskeleton of mature female (EDHM). \nThe experiment was divided into two bioassays: 1) extracts from immature \nfemales and 2) extracts from mature females; each with two treatments and \none control (hexane), evaluated in 15 replicates per treatment. The behavior \nwas classified according to the following grades: 0 = no response; 1 = contact; \n2 = push and 3 = prolonged contact (\u2265 10 s). The association between each \nbehavior presented and between the different treatments was determined using \nBarnard\u2019s exact test; if any behavior was presented more than once in at least \none replicate, a one-way ANOV A was performed to determine if there were \ndifferences in the number of times each behavior occurred. In addition, the \ntotal bioactivity presented was evaluated with the Kruskal-Wallis test.\nFigures 1 and 2 show the results obtained in terms of total bioactivity, finding a \nsignificant association between the reproductive behavior of L. vannamei  and \nthe different extracts tested. The results show sufficient evidence to determine \nthe existence of a contact female sex pheromone with sexual recognition \nfunction\n105\nPRACTICAL CHALLENGES WHEN INJECTING MILLIONS OF FISH WITH V ACCINES \nDagfinn Str\u00f8mme*, Terje Tingb\u00f8 and Hanne Andersen\nPHARMAQ Fishteq, Zoetis, Havneveien 6, N-8700 Nesna, Norway\ndagfinn.stromme@zoetis.com\nInjection vaccines are quickly becoming the method of choice for farmed fish species kept in high densities, mainly \ndue to the long-term protection they provide for the fish. In order to ensure proper immunization, animal welfare and \nsustainability, it is important that the vaccinations are done accurately and swiftly.\nAlmost all farmed Atlantic salmon is currently injected with up to three different vaccines in the abdominal cavity, and \nsometimes also intramuscularly before outset to sea. The majority of fish are vaccinated by hand, but vaccination by \nmachine is becoming increasingly more common in salmon, trout and sea bass farming. The first automatic vaccinations \nof tilapia were performed earlier this year. Current manual injectors can inject one or two vaccines intraperitoneally or \nmuscularly, but it is not possible to inject in two different locations simultaneously. Machines offer a greater vaccination \nrate, accuracy, flexibility, and better biosecurity due to a minimum of people needing to visit the fish farming location. \nInnovations within machine vision and injection systems allows the machines to accurately inject the fish with several \nvaccines simultaneously, and the site and depth of injection is adapted to the individual fish. Injured or deformed fish can \nbe excluded automatically, and populations can be graded by size during vaccination. \nWe will present the use of injection tools to enable vaccinations of large numbers of fish, while increasing production \nefficiency, improving sustainability and maintaining a high level of fish health.106\nAGA VIN REDUCES HIGH-DENSITY STRESS ON GROWTH PERFORMANCE, CORTISOL \nAND GLUCOSE LEVELS ON NILE TILAPIA ( Oreochromis niloticus )\nFlores-M\u00e9ndez, L.C.1, S\u00e1nchez-Guti\u00e9rrez, E.Y ., Liz\u00e1rraga-Vel\u00e1zquez C.E., Leyva-L\u00f3pez, N., G\u00f3mez-Gil, B., \nArrizon J.2Hern\u00e1ndez C.\n1 Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Alimentaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo A.C., Unidad Mazatl\u00e1n, Av.

The use of agavin, as a functional additive, can exert health benefits due to its prebiotic properties. \nAgavin is a highly branched fructan that can be obtained from the waste of the tequila industry 2,3. Studies about agavin in \naquatic organisms are scarce, however, the addition of dietary fructans might improve the growth performance, maintain \ncortisol and glucose levels, and promote fish wellness.3,4 Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of high-density \nstress on growth performance and cortisol and glucose levels of Nile tilapia fed dietary agavin.\nMethods:  Fish were fed a base diet (D0), and two \ndiets with agavin inclusion, 20 (D20), and 40 g/Kg \n(D40). Masculinized Nile tilapia (1.04\u00b10.01 g) were \nstocked into 350 L fiberglass tanks, assigned to four \ntreatments: a control, without high-density stress \nchallenge (DC0-) and three groups challenged with \nhigh-density stress (DC0+, D20, and D40). Each \ntreatment had five replicates, an initial density of \n6 kg/L, and feeding to 10% of body weight. At \n90 days, DC0+, D20, and D40 were subjected to \nhigh-density stress (600 kg/L) for additional 20 \ndays, by reducing water level3, after which growth \nperformance and plasma cortisol and serum glucose \nlevels were evaluated.\nResults and Discussion:  The D20 diet reduced \nthe negative effect of high-density stress on final \nweight (FW) (p<0.05) (Table 1). Regarding cortisol \nand glucose levels, both agavin inclusions (20 and \n40 g/kg) reduced cortisol levels, while the glucose \nlevel was only maintained by the D20 diet during \nthe challenge (Figure 1). Previous studies have \nshown that the addition of fructans can promote \ngrowth performance and reduce oxidative stress \nby acting as anti-stress additives, preventing the \nincrease in cortisol and glucose levels2,3,4. This is \nbecause agavin can regulate the cortisol hormone \nby modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal \naxis, and, stimulating the vagus nerve, in addition \nto modulating pathways related to gluconeogenesis, \nwhich reduces glucose and cortisol levels in stress \nconditions.3, 6, 7 However, factors such as agavin \ndosage, chemical structure, stress conditions, as \nwell as life stage can affect its prebiotic potential. 3,4\n(Continued on next page)107\nConclusion: Theagavin inclusion (20 and 40 g/kg) reduces plasma cortisol levels during the high-density stress challenge \n(600 kg/L), while the inclusion with 20 g/kg of agavin also maintains serum glucose levels and reduces the negative effects \nin FW under stress conditions.\nReferences: \n1) FAO (2017).

Therefore, \ncharacterization of potentially harmful pathogens is one of \nthe most important strategies to control disease outbreaks. \nIn the present study, we investigated for the first time the \npathogenicity of two Vibrio  species, Vibrio metschnikovii , \na foodborne pathogen that causes fatalities in humans, and \nVibrio areninigrae , a bacteria isolated from black sand \nin Korea, using a crustacean model, the signal crayfish \nPacifastacus leniusculus . Mortality challenges indicated \nthat injection of V . metschnikovii  (108 CFU/crayfish) has a \nmortality percentage of 22% in crayfish. In contrast, injection \nof P . leniusculus  with 108 or 107 CFU of V . areninigrae  \nresulted in 100% mortality within one and two days post-\ninjection, respectively. V . areninigrae  was successfully re-\nisolated from hepatopancreas of infected crayfish and caused \n100% mortality when reinjected into new healthy crayfish. \nAs a consequence of this infection, histopathological analysis \nrevealed nodule formation in crayfish hepatopancreas, heart, \nand gills, as well as sloughed cells inside hepatopancreatic \ntubules and atrophy. Moreover, extracellular crude products \n(ECP\u2019s) were obtained from V . areninigrae  in order to \ninvestigate putative virulence factors. In vivo challenges with \nECP\u2019s caused >90% mortalities within the first 24 h. In vitro  \nchallenges with ECP\u2019s of hemocytes induced cytotoxicity of \nhemocytes within the first hour of exposure. These findings \nrepresent the first report that V . areninigrae is a highly \npathogenic bacterium that can cause disease in crustaceans. \nOn the contrary, V . metschnikovii  could not represent a threat \nfor freshwater crayfish.\n111\nIS AQUAPONICS SYSTEM A STRATEGY TO IMPROVE FISH HEALTH AND CONTROL \nDISEASE PRESENTATION?\nAriadne Hern\u00e1ndez-P\u00e9rez*, Laura Patricia Silva-Ledezma\n*Department of Comparative Physiology, Uppsala University. Norbyv\u00e4gen 18A, 752 36 Uppsala, Sweden\nariadne.hernandez.p@gmail.com\nAquaponics biotechnology integrates aquaculture and hydroponics. In this sense, it is accepted that these systems result in \nthe improvement of water quality, higher nutrient availability, and high quality production of a second product, the plants. \nHowever, information regarding a beneficial or detrimental effect upon aquatic organisms at physiological level, and \nparticularly in reducing disease presentation, is still scarce.\nUp to date, the most common physiological parameters, or \u201chealth indicators\u201d, evaluated in organisms from aquaponics \nsystems are those related to production performance aspects, including growth and feed conversion ratio1,2,3. Although \nvaluable in terms of productivity, these parameters aren\u2019t indicators of the immunological features of the organisms, and \ntheir capacity to overcome disease presentation, making it necessary to include a more comprehensive approach. Likewise, \nrecently, some efforts have been made to understand, from an integrative perspective, the role of disease presentation \nin aquaponics systems4,5. However, differences in the design of systems, the lack of direct comparison of aquaponics \ntechnology with traditionally closed-systems, species, water, sizes and stocking densities of fish, and composition of feed \nand feeding rates, still make difficult to fully identify a beneficial interaction between aquaponics and aquatic species to \nimprove health and  control disease presentation. \nElucidating this important issue in a complex system, such as aquaponics, requires the implementation of comprehensive \nstrategies, including: i) in vivo  infection challenges, ii) multi-omics approach, and iii) functional studies. This information \nwill help for a better understanding of the relationships between aquatic organisms to aquaponics during adverse events \nlike disease. \n112\nEFFECT OF FOOD RESTRICTION / REFEEDING ON THE SURVIV AL, GROWTH AND \nENZYMATIC ACTIVITY IN HEPATOPANCREAS AND INTESTINE OF MALAYSIAN \nPRAWN POSTLARV AE CULTURED IN BIOFLOC\nP\u00e9rez de Jes\u00fas Diana, Hern\u00e1ndez-Vergara Martha Patricia, P\u00e9rez-Rostro Carlos Iv\u00e1n, \nFr\u00edas Quintana Carlos Alfonso\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Boca del R\u00edo Km. 12 Rd.

In addition to biofloc, strategies for efficient use of food in \naquaculture have begun to be developed, such as intermittent feeding and compensatory growth, especially in detritus-\nconsuming species, a technology that to date has not been evaluated in the Malayan prawn ( Macrobrachium rosenbergii ) \nin conjunction with biofloc culture. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate the effect of food restriction on the survival, \ngrowth and enzyme activity of Malayan prawn ( M. rosenbergii ) postlarvae during their culture in biofloc.\nThe experimental design was completely randomized with six treatments and three replicates. Three treatment were kept in \nclear water (W) and three in biofloc (B) with 3 days restriction / 3 days refeeding (3) and 3 days restriction / 6 days refeeding \n(6). Controls (BC) and (CW) received food daily. 15 prawns of 0.5 g were used and the study lasted 75 days. The parameters \nof water quality, productive performance, as well as proximal composition and digestive enzyme activity in hepatopancreas \nand intestine were evaluated. Data were analyzed with an ANOV A and Tukey test at p<0.05. The physicochemical variables \nin water were within the tolerance range for the PL\u00b4s. The survival at the end of the study was similar in the treatments \nand greater than 80%. The most efficient growth was obtained in BC, which was significantly higher than the rest of the \ntreatments. Partial compensatory growth of treatments B3 and B6 was observed vs BC and total compensatory growth was \nobtained when compared B3 and B6 vs clear water control (WC), indicating that the biofloc allows maintaining the growth \nof the organisms even in the absence of commercial food. (Table 1). The nutritional composition of the prawns subjected to \nthe treatment BC is significantly higher compared to the other treatments. Variations in enzymatic activity were observed \nin the hepatopancreas and in the intestine as a response to adapt to changes in food restriction and use of the biofloc.\n113\nEV ALUATION OF Vieja bifasciata CICHLID FOR AQUACULTURE: LARVICULTURE AND \nMASCULINIZATION\nUlises Hern\u00e1ndez-Vidal*, Andrea Carreta-Ortiz, Leidy S\u00e1nchez Vel\u00e1zquez, Mar\u00eda J.

This specie \nis considered as candidate for aquaculture due the high demand for traditional cuisine reaching 5 US/kg in regional market, \nand ornamental production is considered promissory for international sales due to coloration. Twoband cichlid larvae \nproduction is feasible using experimental RAS using commercial diets, and actually fry is mainly destinated for restocking \ntraditional fishing areas. In the wild, adults weight commonly show differences by sex like another cichlid species, but \nabsence of data on age do not allows to define a differential grow hypothesis. In order to determine if Vieja  monosexual \npopulation show differential growth, an experimental protocol for fry production and masculinization was developed.\nFourteen, one year old Viaja bisfaciata  adults (180-460 g) reared in laboratory were stocked in 1.7 m3 tanks for larvae \nproduction during reproductive season (April).  Adults were fed twice a day using commercial diet and water quality \nmaintained by weekly 5% water renewal. A triplicated masculinization trial was conducted using first feeding larvae. \nLarvae were fed by 28, 45 and 60 days using a diet containing 60 mg/kg of the steroid (17\u03b1-MT), and a control treatment. \nAt the end of the treatment, fry was transferred to a RAS for grow-out for 120 days and masculinization evaluation.\nSpawning\u2019s occur the second day of adult stocking, but cannibalistic behavior is commonly observed and repeated fight. \nLarvae production ranged from 450 to 1700 larvae by spawn. First feeding occur 5-6 days post hatching at 26-28\u00b0C. \nResults on masculinization indicate that males tend to increasing according to treatment time (P=0.00). Sex proportion data \nindicate a minimal time of 45 days using oral administration of MT is required to increase male proportion production in \nthe twoband cichlid. New experimental protocol is necessary to improve result on male production.\n114\nADV ANTAGES OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GENETIC TECHNOLOGIES FORT HE \nPRODUCTION IMPROVEMENT OF JAPANESE OYSTER Crassostrea gigas CULTURE\nAna M.

This can be associated with endogamy as there are no natural populations of the species to \nmaintain adequate population sizes, since it is a species form Asia. Additionally, the use of diploid seed for culture is also a problem, as they \nare fertile and grow significantly less than triploids, frequently spawning resulting in flaccid individuals. \nTo solve this problem, biotechnology alternatives were incorporated to improve production of the Japanese oyster in Northwest Mexico. \nAmong them, the use of certified triploid organism. The triploid oyster marketed worldwide is known as a \u201cbiological triploid\u201d derived from \nmating a tetraploid and a diploid.  The competitive advantages of production, market value and financial projections were analyzed when \nthe hatchery applies our technology package. This package includes two manuals and technical support tailored to the needs of the client.\nMain competitive advantages of a selection program and triploid production implementation represent a 10% increase in final weight or \nheight per generation based on selection, and up to 70% weight increase when comparing triploid to diploid organisms, particularly in \nstress environments. (see Ibarra AM, Ascencio-Michel R, Ram\u00edrez JL, et al. 2017, J. Shellfish Res. 36, 119-139).  Integrating selection and \nbiological triploid production significant results can be obtained after three generations (time varies depending of culture site and water \ntemperature). 115\nFED-BATCH CULTIVATION OF MICROALGA Picocholorum sp. AND HARVESTING OF \nBIOMASS BY BIO-FLOCCULA TION\nMirela Ivancic Santek*, Marina Grubisic, Marina Strinavic, Bozidar Santek, Rozelindra-Coz Rakovac \nFaculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology\nUniversity of Zagreb10000 Zagreb, Croatiamivancicsantek@pbf.hr\nMicroalgae are promising sustainable feedstock for the production of biofuels, food, feed, chemicals, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. Green marine microalga Picochlorum displays a high growth rate, broad salinity tolerance and \nhigh-temperature tolerance, making this genus suitable for outdoor cultivation. One of the major bottlenecks in the commercialization of microalgal biomass production is energy-intensive harvesting methods. Bio-flocculation is an efficient, low-cost method for harvesting microalgal biomass. Conventional chemical flocculants, commonly used to improve the harvesting efficiency, contaminate growth medium and make biomass unsuitable for food and feed production. Bio-flocculation uses microorganisms as bio-flocculants, especially fungi, which could also improve the quality of isolated biomass.\nTo investigate the growth productivity, Picochlorum sp. was cultivated phototrophically in a 35 L bubble column bioreactor. \nCultivation was conducted in two phases using f/2 medium without pH and temperature control. During the first cultivation \nphase, a high growth rate was maintained by feeding the culture with nitrogen and phosphate sources. When cells entered the stationary phase on the 16th day of cultivation, nitrogen and phosphate sources were depleted. In the second phase of cultivation, the culture was fed with an inorganic carbon source (1 g L\n-1), sodium bicarbonate. The culture was also fed on \nthe 21st and 23rd days with 1 and 0.5 g L-1 of sodium bicarbonate, respectively. Maximal cell number and dry cell weight \nconcentrations were 3.46\u00d7108 cells per millilitre and 1.68 g L-1, respectively. Biomass productivity was 0.0646 g L-1 d -1. \nCell biomass was analyzed for macromolecular composition (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins), fatty acid composition and chlorophyll content. Proteins were the most abundant macromolecule in cell biomass, followed by carbohydrates as the main source of reserve energy with a maximal 37.7 % in dry cell weight. Picochlorum sp. had a low capacity for lipid \naccumulation; at the end of cultivation, the lipid content was only 8 % in dry cell weight. The most dominant fatty acid was linoleic (C18:2), followed by heptadecanoic (C17:0) and palmitic (C16:0). These fatty acids comprised more than 70 % of all fatty acids. During the second cultivation phase, cells also accumulated a significant amount of linolenic (C18:3) acid. \nMicroalgal biomass was harvested by bio-flocculation under optimized conditions using pellets of fungus Mortierella \nisabellina.  This fungus is known for its ability to accumulate a significant quantity of lipids abundant in unsaturated \nfatty acids. The recovery efficiency of microalgal biomass was more than 80 % (g g\n-1) after 150 min. The developed bio-\nflocculation system is a suitable method for chemical-free harvesting of microalgae that could be used as feedstock for feed \nor food production.116\nORGANIC ACID IN BFT WATER FOR NILE\nAdolfo Jatob\u00e1*; Carolina Cristina Alves de Menezes; Norha B\u00f3livar; M\u00e1rnio Roveda; Alexandre Gabbi\nLaborat\u00f3rio de Aquicultura\nInstituto Federal Catarinense, campus  Araquari\nAraquari, SC, Brazil, 89245-000\njatobaadolfo@gmail.com\nThe goal of this work was to evaluate the use of organic acid (Eurotec Nutrition, Brazil) in the water of biofloc technology \nto reared Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ). The work was divided into two steps: 1st) in vitro  assays, inhibition test and \ndose-response; and 2nd) in vivo  assay with Nile tilapia juveniles in BFT.\nFor the in vitro  assays, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays were performed against seven pathogenic bacteria \n(two Aeromonas hidrophyla , A. veronii , Staphylococcus  aureus , Citrobacter freundii , Vibrio parahaemolyticus , and V.  \nalginolyticus ). For the dose-response test, 2.5 ppm, 5.0 ppm, 10.0 ppm and 20.0 ppm (doses defined from the product\u2019s user \nmanual) were evaluated in triplicate. Fifteen bottle units with a capacity of 1 liter were used, all bottles received a constant \nand independent aeration system, which entered through the lid. For in vivo  assay, in experimental units (8 retangular tanks, \n0.72 m\u00b2 x 0.35 m) with 250 L, water fertilization was carried out with a carbon source (sugar) and powdered diet to keep \nthe carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio 10:1, resulting in an initial solids concentration of 100.0 mg L-1. The experimental units \nwere divided into two groups (organic acid and control) in quadruplicate, each tank with 20 fish. Fish were fed three times \nper day (8:00, 12:00 and 16:00), with commercial diet, with 3% of the fish biomass.  Dissolved oxygen and temperature \nwere performed measured twice a day. Total suspended solids (TSS), settleable solids, pH, hardness and alkalinity were \nmonitored twice a week. Ammonia (total ammonia nitrogen \u2212 TAN), nitrite-N,  and nitrate-N were also monitored twice a \nweek. Growth performance was determined after six weeks.\nOrganic acid had an inhibitory effect against all pathogenic bacteria tested (Table 1). The largest inhibition halo (mm) was \nobtained against the bacterium S. aureus  (60.00 \u00b1 5.00), and the smallest halos were obtained against A. hidrophyla  (42.00 \n\u00b1 3.46) and C. freundii  (41.00 \u00b1 1.73). The 2.5 ppm dose presented the most interesting results for the in vivo  assay, as it \ndid not significantly reduce the pH and alkalinity of the water. Nile tilapia  shown FCR closed 1.0 in both treatments, as \nwell, SGR above 3.4%.day-1 acid reduced the nitrogen compounds orthophosphate, the other parameters did not diverge \n(Table 1).\nThe organic acid in the water in BFT, at a dosage of 2.5ppm, proved to be favorable against the reduction of toxic ammonia, \nnitrite and orthophosphate, improving the Nile tilapia culture environment.\n117\nPichia guilliermondii   ENHANCES SHRIMP IMMUNITY AND GROWTH\nFran\u00e7ois J\u00e9gou*1 \nfrancois.jegou@adm.com\nSarah Cooper2, Yoav Rosen1, Delphine Weissman1\nPathogens, environmental stressors and opportunistic diseases are ubiquitous in aquaculture. Achieving efficient and \nprofitable production, especially with the increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance, is critical for producers. \nHelping aquaculture species to better perform with infectious and physiological pressures is therefore of high interest and \na focus of research.\nCardozo et al.,  20183 compared in vitro  bacterial aggregation capacity of inactivated Pichia guilliermondii (Pg) and \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc), with Mannose as the positive control. Pg demonstrated twice the aggregation capacity at all \ncommercial  dosages compared to that of Sc (Fig 1). Pathogen aggregation is critical in innate immunity and homeostasis.\nTo assess the bacterial aggregation capacity of Pg in vivo , a bacterial clearance study was performed: Litopenaeus vanna -\nmei shrimp were injected with  Vibrio harveyi.  Three hours post-injection, V . harveyi  concentration in hemolymph in the \nPg fed shrimp was more than 3 times lower compared to control-fed shrimp (Fig 2).

Achieving efficient and \nprofitable production, especially with the increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance, is critical for producers. \nHelping aquaculture species to better perform with infectious and physiological pressures is therefore of high interest and \na focus of research.\nCardozo et al.,  20183 compared in vitro  bacterial aggregation capacity of inactivated Pichia guilliermondii (Pg) and \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc), with Mannose as the positive control. Pg demonstrated twice the aggregation capacity at all \ncommercial  dosages compared to that of Sc (Fig 1). Pathogen aggregation is critical in innate immunity and homeostasis.\nTo assess the bacterial aggregation capacity of Pg in vivo , a bacterial clearance study was performed: Litopenaeus vannamei \nshrimp were injected with  Vibrio harveyi.  Three hours post-injection, V . harveyi  concentration in hemolymph in the Pg fed \nshrimp was more than 3 times lower compared to control-fed shrimp (Fig 2). It was also shown that the granular hemocyte \nconcentration in hemolymph was 56% higher after 4 weeks in Pg fed shrimp compared to that in control shrimp. (Fig 3) \n.

C.P. 94290\nTel. / Fax (229) 986 01 89\nE-mail: m20990405@bdelrio.tecnm.mx\nIn aquaculture, to increase production and mitigate competition for water resources, multiple technologies have been \nimplemented, such as AMTI, which consists of the culture of two or more species of different trophic levels, so that the \nwaste from one is used by another (Gonz\u00e1lez-Henr\u00edquez, 2015). The objective of the present research was to develop an \nintegrated multitrophic aquaculture system (IMTA) by tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ), Malaysian prawn ( Macrobrachium \nrosenbergii ) for the production of two species of chili plants.\nThe experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments (IMTA and control) in triplicate. Each experimental \nunit consisted of 85 tilapia m3, 20 prawn m2, 20 chili plants (serrano and jalape\u00f1o) per m2. The control consisted of the \nindividual cultivation of each species (plants in hydroponic system). The study lasted 180 days; the parameters of water \nquality, productive performance of the animals and plants in culture, as well as nutrients (K, Na, Ca and P) were evaluated \nboth in the water culture and in the sap of the plants. Data were analyzed with a Student\u2019 s t-test at p<0.05. \nThe physicochemical variables in water showed similar concentrations in IMTA and the control, except for NO3 which \npresented significantly higher values in the water plants. Electrical conductivity (Ce) was higher in organisms cultured \nin IMTA. Plants in the control group had higher values of K, while Na and Ca concentrations were higher in organisms \ncultured in IMTA, except between tilapia in IMTA and control, when the values were similar. Values of P were high and \nsimilar among organisms cultured in IMTA and control plants. The productive performance in tilapia was higher in the \nIMTA, and the prawns in the control group. Chili plants had higher survival and growth in the IMTA and only jalape\u00f1o \nplants produced fruit in the IMTA (Table 1).\n120\nFATTY ACID PROFILE OF MACROALGA Gongolaria barbata  FROM THE ADRIATIC SEA\nS.

The fatty acid content was analyzed by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). \nThe major saturated fatty acid (SFA) in G. barbata  was palmitic acid (33.16 \u00b1 0.41%) followed by stearic (8.22 \u00b1 0.61%) \nand myristic acids (4.90 \u00b1 0.07%). Besides oleic acid isomers (17.72 \u00b1 0.18%), a significant amounts of arachidonic \nacid (ARA) were found (11.96 \u00b1 0.19%) among polyunsaturated FAs. ARA is an important biomembranes constituent, a \nprecursor of prostlandins and other eicosanoids.  \nFrom nutritional aspect, FAs are very important components that provide normal functioning of the human metabolism, \nhealth and prevention of diseases. The composition and content of fatty acids in macroalgae samples was determined using \ngas chromatography with flame-ionization detection after total lipid extraction was obtained by Folch method. Nutritional \nvalue of FAs is evaluated and expressed as nutritional indices and most widely used indices are: PUFA/SFA ratio, index \nof atherogenicity (IA), index of thrombogenicity(IT), unsaturated index (UI), hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic \nratio (HH). IA and IT are indices correlated with potential effect of FA on cardiovascular health (CHV). IA and IT values \nfor G. barbata  obtained in this study were 1.11 and 1.32. When comparing IA and IT values of brown macroalgae to \nother foods, the values are higher than in crops, fish and meat but lower than in dairy products. UI indicated the degree of \nunsaturation in lipids and is commonly used for evaluation of PUFAs content and quality in macroalgae. UI for G. barbata \ncalculated in this study was 101.49.\n121\nSUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION OF SHRIMP FARMING: I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES\nLorenzo M. Juarez Mabarak*\nSea Products Development, LLC\n1201 Copano Retreat Rd.\nRockport, TX 78390. USA.\nlorenzojuarez@yahoo.com\nIntensification is the application of additional resources to increase shrimp farm productivity. Such resources include \nmanagement, labor, land, water, feeds, postlarvae, energy, aeration, and agrochemicals, among others. Ideally, intensification \nresults in those additional resources getting amortized over the additional production in such a way that less of each resource \nends up been used by unit of shrimp produced. Typically, intensification implies higher total investment and operation \ncosts, but lower cost of production per kg of shrimp. As intensity increases biological and business risks also increase.\nThe concept of sustainability is subjective and can have different meanings under different disciplines. It normally \nencompasses environmental, economic, and social components with a fourth dimension of corporate governance. In this \npresentation I will mostly use a utilitarian definition based on the quantifying of resources used by unit of shrimp produced.\nThere are two main reasons to intensify shrimp farms: (1) to make more efficient use of resources and (2) to improve \nenterprise profitability and competitiveness. A recent study showed that 94% of all farmed shrimp production comes from \nonly 58% of the farming area, or conversely that only 6% comes from the remaining 42% of the area. A large portion of the \nglobal pond area is highly inefficient and hides large environmental costs. \nIntensive systems can be better for the environment because they use less land; especially pristine or highly sensible land, \nexchange less water and contaminants, and make generally more efficient use of resources such as feeds. \nExamples of intensive systems, and of areas or countries that have intensified, are presented, and reasons for resistance to \nintensification are shown together with possible solutions and opportunities. 122\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND INTENSIFICATION IN AQUACULTURE: II. \nEFFICIENCY IS THE NAME OF THE GAME\nLorenzo M. Juarez Mabarak*\nSea Products Development, LLC\n1201 Copano Retreat Rd.\nRockport, TX 78390. USA.\nlorenzojuarez@yahoo.com\nProperly executed intensification helps the planet and helps the enterprise by making more efficient use of resources and \nproducing products that cost less to produce per unit. This paper begins with a bird\u2019s eye look at the state of the planet \nin relation to the major environmental problems, including climate change, ocean acidification, plastic residues, rates of \nextinction, and the state of world\u2019s fisheries. Sustainability is defined according to different disciplines and a practical \ndefinition is presented in terms of resource use efficiency. The main recognized environmental impacts of aquaculture \nare reviewed with emphasis on their management and minimization. We end by discussing the future of aquaculture \nsustainability and the technologies that will make it more friendly to the environment\n123\nFREE AMINO-ACIDS MIX MADE OF POULTRY KERATIN IMPROVES SURVIV AL OF \nWHITELEG SHRIMP POST LARV AE  Litopenaeus vannamei CHALLENGED WITH ACUTE \nHEPATOPANCREATIC NECROSIS DISEASE AND WHITE SPOT SYNDROME VIRUS \nKersant\u00e9 Pierrick*, Le Reste Guillaume, Diringer Benoit, Quimi Juan, Sergheraert Renaud, Duperray Jo\u00ebl\nBCF Life Sciences, Boisel, \n56140 PLEUCADEUC \u2013 France \npkersante@bcf-lifesciences.com \nWith their low molecular weight and high level of assimilation, mixes of free amino acids (MFAA) obtained from poultry \nkeratin extensive hydrolysis are potential interesting candidates for aquaculture feeds dedicated to first development \nstages. In addition to previous results underlining MFAA positive effect on shrimp zootechnical performances, further \ninvestigations were conducted in partnership with Incabiotec/Concepto Azul, Tumbes, Peru, to evaluate potential of \nMFAA as new efficient solutions to improve immune response of white shrimp, L.vannamei , in case of bacteriological \nand viral challenges.  Two trials, I and II, were conducted to evaluate the effects of MFAA on whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus \nvannamei  post larvae (PL). Both trials included a growth phase and experimental challenges. In these two trials, PL were \nfed four diets (control; control+1% MFAA; control+5% MFAA; control+10% MFAA) respectively for 28 days (trial I) \nand 21 days (trial II) for growth phases. Following this growth phases, animals were either experimentally infected with \nwhite spot syndrome virus (WSSV group) or Vibrio parahaemolyticus, with a toxin gene-bearing plasmid responsible for \nacute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND group), or mock infected (non-infected control) considering four diets \ntreatments (control; control+1% MFAA; control+5% MFAA; control+10% MFAA) during 28 days for trials I and II. \nIn these two trials, survival and biomass reached higher rates in WSSV infection groups, for PL fed with MFAA (Graph \n1). For AHPND infection group in trial II, survival and biomass were also higher for PL fed with MFAA (Graph 2). Those \nresults show the potential of MFAA to enhance shrimp PL performance and their application as shrimp feeding ingredients \nwith functional benefits on animal survival in case of immune challenge.\n124\nDE NOVO ASSEMBLY AND ANNOTATION OF THE TRANSCRIPTOME OF THE NARROW-\nCLAWED CRAYFISH Pontastacus leptodactylus  IN CASPIAN SEA\nMajidreza Khoshkholgh1* and Sajad Nazari2\n1Department of Fisheries, Faculty of Natural Resources, University of Guilan, P.O. Box 1144 Sowmehsara, Iran\n2Shahid Motahary Cold-water Fishes Genetic and Breeding Research Center, Iranian Fisheries Sciences Research \nInstitute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Yasouj, Iran\nThe narrow-clawed crayfish Pontastacus leptodactylus  (Eschscholtz, 1823) is an important cultured crayfish species in \nIran. For further genetic improvement, however, our current knowledge of genetic resources in this species remains very \nlimited. We conducted comparative analysis of the gills transcriptomes of  P . leptodactylus  from two different environments \n(Caspian Sea and Aras reservoir) based on Illumina RNA-seq technology. The transcriptome sequencing of cDNA libraries \ngenerated 419.2 million clean reads, the N50 and mean length of the identified 78895 unigenes were 1648and 864bp, \nrespectively.  A total of 3,759 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained between the two environments, of \nwhich 1,443 predicted to be up-regulated in Aras reservoir and 2,316 in Caspian Sea samples. A total of six differential \ngenes related to the osmoregulation were selected. The qPCR analysis showed that the expression changes of these six \ndifferential genes were consistent with the results of transcriptome sequencing. Total number of filtered SNPs for Caspian \nSea and Aras reservoir samples were 259 and 193, respectively. In addition, total number of identified single sequence \nrepeats (SSRs) were 14,235. The putative DEGs between the gills provide an important source of information for further \nstudy of the osmoregulation related genes in  P . leptodactylus  as well as development of molecular markers.125\nABNORMAL BEHA VIOR IN ROCK BREAM  Oplegnathus fasciatus DETECTED USING \nDEEP LEARNING-BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS\nYeo Reum Kim*, Jun Chul Jang, Han Kyu Lim, Jong-Myoung Kim\nDepartment of Fisheries Biology, College of Fisheries Sciences\nPuKyong National University, Busan, Republic of Korea\njongkim@pknu.ac.kr  \nFish production by the aquaculture industry has steadily increased to provide alternative fish resources. To overcome \ndifficulties associated with a manual labor-intensive farming technologies and create a more systematic aquaculture \nmanagement system that is compatible with the oncoming fourth industrial evolution, it is important to automate some \naspects of the aquaculture industry such as water quality detection, automatic feeding systems, and real-time underwater \nmonitoring. Despite of technologies have already been adapted to monitor physical conditions, those for automatic \nmonitoring of fish behavior are still needed for real-time fish condition assessment. In this study, we applied the YOLO deep \nlearning algorithm to detect abnormal swimming behavior of rock bream Oplegnathus fasciatus , based on fish movement \ndata. We recorded images of rock bream before and after adding an anesthetic (MS-222) or the replacement of seawater \nwith fresh water and then evaluated the ability of algorithm to detect fish displaying abnormal behavior. The proposed \nalgorithm showed a high accuracy (88.1%) in discriminating normal and abnormal rock bream behavior. We conclude that \nartificial intelligence-based detection of abnormal behavior can be applied to develop an automatic biomanagement system \nfor use in the aquaculture industry.\nThe collected data included 10,110 rock bream images obtained from the video recording. Among these, 210 images \nwere randomly selected and divided these into a training dataset containing 168 images and a test dataset containing 42 \nimages. Images of rock bream swimming upright and lying on their side were considered to exhibit normal and abnormal \nswimming, respectively.\n126\nGOOD AQUACULTURE PRACTICES; THE COLLABORATIVE USE AND BENEFITS\nB.Koonse\nPOB 1129, Harpers Ferry, WV 25425\nBrettkoonse@yahoo.com\nThe Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (JIFSAN) is a collaboration between the United States Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) and the University of Maryland (UM).

Es as\u00ed, \ncomo el objetivo del presente trabajo fue analizar el potencial de la acuacultura org\u00e1nica en M\u00e9xico. Debido a la actitud de \nlas personas por dejar de consumir alimentos industrializados, se ha incrementado la demanda de alimentos m\u00e1s nutritivos \ne inocuos, el aumento del consumo per c\u00e1pita de productos org\u00e1nicos que ha ocasionado este cambio de actitud provoca \nque la acuacultura org\u00e1nica sea vista como una pr\u00e1ctica econ\u00f3mica rentable. Por ello, se estima que la acuacultura org\u00e1nica \ncomenzar\u00e1 a tomar relevancia en el mundo y en el pa\u00eds, aunado a la concientizaci\u00f3n de las personas por el agotamiento de \nlos recursos naturales y por el da\u00f1o a la salud humana que causan de manera directa o indirecta los sistemas de producci\u00f3n \nindustrializados; De este modo la acuacultura org\u00e1nica se ha empezado a considerar como una opci\u00f3n que puede impulsar \nel desarrollo del mercado interno.

Es importante mencionar \nque el etiquetado org\u00e1nico de los alimentos producidos en los sistemas acu\u00edcolas hace que los consumidores opten por \nadquirir dichos productos por sus implicaciones ambientales y productivas (carne de mejor calidad), ya que garantizan ser \nalimentos saludables e inocuos, producidos de manera amigable con el medio ambiente. El presente trabajo consisti\u00f3 en \nrevisar los protocolos de la producci\u00f3n org\u00e1nica a nivel mundial y nacional, y su aplicaci\u00f3n en la acuacultura mexicana, \nespecialmente en Oreochromis niloticus que es la  especie que m\u00e1s se produce en el pa\u00eds y que tiene el mayor potencial de \nproducirse org\u00e1nicamente por su calidad de omn\u00edvora.

Above 24\u00b0C, it got stressed with osmoregulatory disturbances. Since 2015, east coast of Korea, land base flounder \nfarm is continually harmed with temperatures climbing to 28\u00b0C or higher, which induces long-term stress responses, thus \nlowering immunity and causing mass mortality. However, during high temperature in the recent summer, 1st year juvenile \nsurvived, and only 2nd year adult fish died in mass mortality in farms. We hypothesized that there is a difference in the heat \nresistance of starry flounder by age in heat environment. This study, we investigated the different response of juveniles \nand adult starry flounder to heat stress. This study compares the physiological and molecular consequences of exposure \nin starry flounder to increasing water temperature (2\u00b0C/day)  from 16 \u00b0C until the target temperature, 28.5\u00b10.5 \u00b0C.

Have been consolidated as one of the natural alternatives of the use of antibiotics, because they do not generate \neffects colateral. Probiotics can supplant growth promoters and in adequate amounts reduce mortality and increase feed \nconversi\u00f3n (Gutierrez et 2013).\nThe experiment was carried out in September 2019, at the Atisa company, Puerto Pizarro, Tumbes, with a duration of \n14 days, in which 6,560,000 postlarvae of white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei were used, originating from the Arrecife \nlaboratory, Ecuador. The larvae arrived in bags with oxygen inside a cardboard box, these were randomly distributed in 4 \nconcrete raceways, each having a 1640000 with a density of 21 L / m3. A versus was carried out in which the RW-6 and \nRW-7 were added the marine probiotic in the food and for the RW-3 and RW-4 the probiotic HGS-7, vitamin DSM and \nglue were added in the white shrimp feed. The initial weight of the larvae was 310 larvae x gram, the initial feeding rate \nwas 30% of the biomass, of the AQUATECH brand. About the quality of   water (dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and \nsalinity) were evaluated every 2 hours with a multiparameter of the brand, while the chemical parameters of water (NH4, \nNO2, NO3) were evaluated with a  spectrophotometer every 2 days during the experiment. \nNo significant difference was found at the end of evaluation in the productive indicators, such as specific and absolute \ngrowth rate, the same in the water quality parameters.

This scenario needs to face certain technical problems as oxygen \ndepletion, generation of high amount of nitrogen waste, large concentrations of fish in confined environment. These factors \nact as a stressors to the animals, and affect in negative ways physiological and zootechnical parameters like growth ratio, \nimmune system response, and the risk of disease outbreaks.\nIs understood by adaptogen a nontoxic substance and especially a plant extract that is held to increase the body\u2019s ability \nto resist the damaging effects of stress and promote or restore normal physiological functioning. Botanicals are nowadays \nconsidered to be safe additives that can be included in diets to improve the health and performance of animal as well as fish \n(Le et al., 2016; Fawole et al., 2016).\nThe objective of this study, carried out in Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ), was to evaluate the effect of three \nnutraceutical compounds on growth, blood parameters, immune response, and liver health before and after the challenge \nwith the bacteria  Aeromona Hydrophila.\nThe results obtained during the study, show that the addition of nutraceuticals PIM1 and PIM 3 enhanced the zootechnical \nparameters, improved Nile tilapia survival against Aeromona hydrophila  infection by increasing innate immunity and \nantioxidant response. The liver histology and lower CRP value revealed that PIM 1 and PIM 3 have the capacity to confer \ncertain level of protection on the hepatic tissue of Nile Tilapia against pathogen aggression.\n135\nSURVEY FOR VIRAL PATHOGENS IN INV ASIVE SPECIES Penaeus monodon  CAUGHT IN \nTHE GULF OF MEXICO COAST IN 2019 AND 2020\nL\u00f3pez T\u00e9llez NA*, Wakida Kusunoki AT, Rodr\u00edguez Canul R\nINAPESCA, CRIAP-Lerma\nKm 5 carr Campeche Lerma n\u00fam. 200\nCampeche, Camp.

CP24500\nViral pathogens such as white spot (WSSV), Hepatopancreatitis Parvo virus (HPV), Penstyldensovirus (PstDV1), Taura \nsyndrome (TSV) and Infectious myonecrosis virus (IMNV) were studied in 31 organism (10 juveniles and 21 adults) of \nPenaeus monodon  captured on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico during 2019 (26 organisms) and 2020 (5 organisms). The \naverage size and weight of specimens was 198 mm TL, 35 mm CL and 92.8 W (Table 1), where 55% were female and 45% \nmale Stage I and II gonadal development stages were found in females \nThe fixation of branchial lamellae and tests were carried out individually, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) \ntechnique. Commercial kit IQ2000 \u2122 was used for each virus. The criteria for the interpretation of the results was according \nto the kit manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The 2% agarose gel results show us that no sample of the tiger shrimp caught in the \nMexican coasts of Gulf de Mexico wasn\u00b4t positive for the fourth viruses (IMNV , TSV , HPV and WSSV) (Fig. 1) while \nPstDV1 was detected in two specimens collected from Veracruz and Tabasco. It is important to continue monitoring wild \npopulations in the Gulf of Mexico, in order to establish a relationship between the health status of wild shrimp populations \nand invasive species Penaeus monodon.  \n136\nEV ALUATION OF INLAND SALINE GROUNDWATER FOR Penaeus brasiliensis  CULTURE \nIN YUCATAN\nEnrique Lozano-\u00c1lvarez*, Ed\u00e9n Maga\u00f1a-Gallegos, Elisa Chan-Vivas, Fernando Negrete-Soto, Manuel Valenzuela, \nGabriela Gaxiola\nUnidad Acad\u00e9mica de Sistemas Arrecifales, Instituto de Ciencias del Mar y Limnolog\u00eda, UNAM, Puerto Morelos, \nMexico\nFor many decades, shrimp aquaculture has relied on the culture of a few penaeid species, with a preference on Penaeus \nmonodon  and P . vannamei . These species have achieved such success that they are being raised outside their natural regions \nof distribution, raising concern about potential escapes and the ecological harm they could cause. As a result, the culture \nof native species is of considerable importance around the world, and significant efforts must be done in this area. Penaeus \nbrasiliensis  is a native species in the Yucatan peninsula with a great potential for culture. This species has been shown to \nthrive and survive at quite high densities and salinities above its isosmotic point (> 25 ppt). Given the karstic structure of \nthe Yucatan peninsula\u2019s ground and the saline intrusion tens of kilometers inland, inland culture of this native species could \nbe a possibility. The aim of this work was to evaluate the suitability of the culture of P . brasiliensis  in saline groundwater. \nShrimp weighing 1.1 g were cultivated outdoors for 45 days in biofloc at 95 ind m2 in 3.14 m2 tanks (depth = 0.8 m) in \ntriplicate in either saline groundwater collected from a well (60 m depth, salinity = 30 ppt) or natural seawater (salinity = 35 \nppt). Shrimps were fed five times per day. Salinity was corrected with freshwater, aeration was provided with a 1 HP blower \nand diffusers, and each tank had an artificial substrate. Temperature and salinity decreased over time due to climatological \nconditions, which may be associated to a decrease in growth rate of shrimp at the end of the experiment. Nutrient levels \n(NH4, NO2, and NO3) were optimal for this species culture, and alkalinity decreased over time because of the nitrification \nprocess (no corrections were made). Shrimp performance was evaluated at the end of the experiment in terms of final \nweight, survival, growth rate, and final biomass. There were no significant differences in shrimp production between saline \ngroundwater and natural seawater (Table 1), suggesting that inland shrimp culture is a possibility. \n137\nEFFICIENT MICROALGAE PRODUCTION SYSTEM\nAlfonso N.

Since the 1960s, technologies have \nbeen developed to mass-produce them monospecifically and without pathogenic bacteria for the organism to be fed, and it \nis not yet possible to replace them with inert foods. In most cases, the production of this live food in hatcheries is one of \nthe phases with the highest cost and represents a risk for crops if a safe and financially viable technology is not available. \nThis proposal presents an alternative developed at CIBNOR for the massive and continuous production of microalgae, \nwith moderate investment and low production costs. This system has been tested and evaluated in a commercial mollusk \nhatchery, using pasteurized water and LED lighting as an alternative to lower production costs. Typical species used \nin aquaculture were produced in this system including: Tisochrysis luthea, Pavolova lutheri, Chaetoceros gracilis, C. \ncalcitrans and Thalassiosira pseudonana.  The technical and financial results will be presented in the runway of innovative \ntechnological developments at the World Aquaculture 2021 conference, as well as some business alternatives that investors \ncould consider to cover the demand for live feed in mollusk, shrimp and fish hatcheries.138\nTHE EFFECTS OF SALINITY REDUCTION RATES DURING Litopenaeus vannamei \nPOSTLARV AE ACCLIMATION ON SURVIV AL AND GILLS AND HEPATOPANCREAS \nHISTOPATHOLOGY\nVitalina Magalh\u00e3es*, Andr\u00e9 Braga, Samuel Sanchez, Ernesto Larios-Soriano, Mario Galaviz\nAutonomous University of Baja California, School of Marine Sciences.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of different rates of \nsalinity reduction on the survival and gill and hepatopancreas histopathology of PLs during the acclimation period.\nShrimp (21-old-day PL; n=360) were distributed in nine 5 L tanks, where they were acclimated to low salinity via its \ndecreasing from 35 to 1 g/L within 24 hours according two salinity reduction rate treatments: A1, constant rate of 1.45 \ng/L/h; A2, using 0.46%/h from 35 to 5 g/L, 0.25g/L/h from 5 to 2 g/L, and 0.13 g/L/h from 2 to 1 g/L. Also, a control group \nwas maintained at 35 g/L but with a saltwater exchange rate of 40%/h. All groups were evaluated in triplicate. At the end of \nthe acclimation (24h) and 24 hours later (24h+), survival was determined, and PLs were collected for further histological \nanalysis of gill and hepatopancreas following hemocyanin and eosin method.\nNo differences were observed for survival at 24h. On the other hand, it was significantly lower in A1 at 24h+ compared \nto A2 and control (Table1). Despite no difference was observed for survival between A2 and control, the former exhibited \nseveral histopathological damages compared to control. For instance, in the epithelial structure of the gill filaments was \nobserved hemocytic infiltration and a hypertrophy at 24h and 24h+ (Fig.1B and D). Hepatopancreas of the analyzed \nsamples, in 70% it was not possible to identify the cells (R, B, F) from A2 (Fig.1F and H). While, at 24h+, 60% from \nA2 exhibited ruptured epithelial cells, abnormal appearance in the structure and reduction of B and R cells (Fig. 2D). \nIn conclusion, salinity reduction during PLs acclimation may not reduce survival but causes several histopathological \ndamages in gills and hepatopancreas.\n139\nTHE ROLE OF PREVENTATIVE FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT IN SUSTAINABLE \nAQUACULTURE PRODUCTION (oral presentation)\nTerje Tingb\u00f8*, Claudia Maira, Andres Henao and Ben North\nPHARMAQ part of Zoetis, Harbitzall\u00e9en 2A, 0275 Oslo, Norway\nterje.tingbo@zoetis.com\nGlobal aquaculture of finfish has seen significant growth over the last decades, driven by static wild capture, increased \nconsumer demand and expansion of global trade. Despite industrialization, consolidation and rapidly improving \ntechnologies, the aquaculture industry faces significant challenges to meet the sustainability criteria required for a healthy \ngrowth. There is a strong focus on animal welfare, food safety and environmental impact among authorities, consumers and \nthe general public, and the increasing occurrence of antimicrobial resistance caused by use of antibiotics is a major concern \nto both animal- and human health.   \nA shift towards preventative fish health management is required to build a healthy and sustainable industry. Key factors are \ndiagnostic tools, biosecurity, regulations, collaboration between stakeholders, introduction of vaccines and knowledge of \nfish health and welfare. A good example of successful preventative fish health management is salmonid farming in Norway, \nwhere more than 1.4 million tonnes are produced annually with minimal use of antibiotics. Vaccination is mandatory, and \nmultivalent vaccines protecting against up to seven different pathogens are commonly used.       \nThe most appropriate interventions depend on the level of intensification and industrialization. A large part of global \naquaculture production is still done by small farms who supply local markets that do not necessarily recognize and reward \nenvironmentally sound and sustainable practices. When intensive monoculture evolves into industrialized production, \nintroduction of advanced technology such as vaccines becomes feasible. Infrastructure, tools and procedures for husbandry \nand fish health management are then in place, and profit margins allow farmers to invest in new technologies. Among \nspecies being produced industrially today are salmonids, sea bass, sea bream, tilapia, pangasius, catfish, barramundi and \ngroupers.\nImportant success factors when developing vaccines are knowing the species and having a proper understanding of the \ndisease situation through appropriate diagnostics. The epidemiology is often complex and protection against several \npathogens may be required in order to make a significant impact. Establishing good procedures for vaccination, such as \nhealth checks, proper equipment, training of personnel and quality control, is also key to ensure an optimal result and \nprofitability. \nWe will present our experiences from fish health management and development and introduction of vaccines in established \nmarkets, and highlight challenges and success factors for emerging species.140\nIMPROVED GROWTH PERFORMANCE OF WHITELEG SHRIMP Penaeus vannamei  \nUSING A PHYTOGENIC FEED ADDITIVE\nAlex Makol*, Tobias Aumiller and Karola R. Wendler\nDelacon Biotechnik GmbH, Langwiesen 24, 4209 Engerwitzdorf, Austria\nEmail: alex.makol@delacon.com\nCrustacean production in 2018 reached 9.4 million tonnes, being marine shrimps dominating the production of crustaceans \ntypically farmed in coastal aquaculture. Besides, they are an important source of earnings for a number of developing \ncountries in Asia and Latin America. Whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) is the largest produced species with 4.9 million \ntonnes, accounting for the 52.9% of total crusteans produced. Optimizing shrimp production performance is crucial to \nthe success of the sector. Efficient diet formulation together with successful health and welfare management determines \nhigher production output. As part of a proactive approach to production health and performance, the use of functional and \nsustainable additives, such as phytogenics, has demonstrated to be an ef fective tool to boost shrimp performance.  \nTwo different studies were conducted to determine the efficacy of a new phytogenic feed additive (PFA) mixture (saponins, \nspices and essential oils) on whiteleg shrimp growth performance and feed efficiency. In the first one, six hundred SPF \nshrimps of average initial weight of 1.9\u00b10.26 g were allocated into three groups using with four replications for each \ntreatment in 350 L tanks. In the second one, two hundred and forty shrimps of average initial weight of 1\u00b10.01 g were \nrandomly allocated into three groups with four replications for each treatment in 20 L baskets. In both studies, shrimps were \nfed for 6 weeks the different treatments: one control group (basal diet) and two groups receiving Syrena\u00ae Boost included \nat 200 & 400 mg/kg of feed, respectively. \nAfter 6 weeks of feeding, results in the first study showed that shrimp survival did not differ between treatments being above \n80%. In terms of growth performance, shrimps fed Syrena\u00ae Boost at both inclusion rates showed an increase of weight \ngain of 12.5% and 13.3%, respectively, with an increase in average daily growth (ADG) of 12.9% and 13.5%, respectively. \nFeed conversion ratio (FCR) was similar between treatments. In the second study, again shrimp survival did not differ \nbetween treatments being above 94% in all treatments. Shrimps fed Syrena\u00ae Boost at both inclusion rates showed again \nan increase of weight gain of 10.1% and 7.9%, respectively, being statistically significant (p\u22640.1) at the lowest dose. ADG \nwas also improved by 9.7% and 7.9%, respectively, again being statistically significant (p\u22640.1) at the lowest dose. FCR \nwas reduced by 3.7% and 1.7%, respectively. Altogether, these results indicate the positive growth performance effects of \nthis new PFA in whiteleg shrimp. 141\nEFFECT OF PELLED DIETS BASED ON FISH WASTE ON THE NUTRITION OF Octopus \nmaya JUVENILES\nAlejandra Malag\u00f3n, Pedro Gallardo, Carlos Rosas, Claudia Caamal, Eduardo Ortega\nUnidad Multidisciplinaria de Docencia e Investigaci\u00f3n, Facultad de Ciencias\nUniversidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico\nalemalagonf@gmail.com\nOctopus maya has been recognized as having a high potential for commercial cultivation. Various studies have allowed \nthe development of a food formulation based on squid and crab meat for this species (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2014; Gallardo et \nal, 2020). However, this diet can become expensive, which is why the present work seeks to replace these inputs with fish \nwaste. For this, 3 diets (in triplicate) of partial and total replacement of squid and crab with fish waste were tested: CT) \nControl (freeze-dried squid and crab);  partial replacement (DPR) and total replacement (DTR).\nOctopuses 75 days old (DPH, 5g) from a single spawning were used, maintained with the control diet. Chac chi ( Haemulon \nplumieri ) fish waste was homogenized and mixed with vitamins and minerals, gelatin and crab protein hydrolyzate. The \nexperiment lasted 43 d in rectangular tanks of 2 x 1.5 x 0.4 m with recirculating seawater and controlled conditions. 1\u201d (5 \ncm) PVC pipes were used as shelters and fed 3 times a day.\nThe control diet allowed good growth and survival, whose values were higher than those observed in the octopuses \nmaintained with the other diets (Table 1). However, both the growth and the survival of the octopuses subjected to the \ndiets with the waste showed a great variation, which influenced that there were no differences between treatments with the \napplied statistic (ANOV A) (Table 1).\nThe results show that the diets formulated with \u201cChac chi\u201d fish waste do not exceed the nutritional quality of the control \ndiet whose inputs are freeze-dried, however, it could be a good alternative by modifying the feeding frequency in future \nexperiments.\nReferences\nGallardo P.*, ..., and Rodriguez S. 2020.

M\u00e9xico; C.P. 23096\njmares@cibnor.pg.mx\nStudies in seascape genomics have detected levels of adaptive divergence in marine species with high gene flow and \nhomogeneous populations. This has highlighted the relevance of geographic and environmental factors as drivers for \nlocal adaptations in fishery resources. The pink abalone ( Haliotis corrugata ) is distributed from California, USA to Baja \nCalifornia Sur, Mexico; exposed to an environmental latitudinal gradient, influenced mainly by the California Current \nSystem (CC). The CC carries warm waters from California to the south, while the California Countercurrent carries warm \nwaters, seasonally supplied by the North Equatorial Current to the north. The management of the pink abalone transcends \nthe international border, while Mexico has an active fishery, organized in four administrative areas, the United States keeps \nthe fishery in permanent closure. Both contrasting management strategies lack genetic information that supports such \nspatial arrangement. Recently, evidence of genomic-population structure was obtained in Mexico; however, the effect of \nthe environment on genetic variation along the species distribution range remains unknown. The objective of the study is \nto define the biocomplexity of Haliotis corrugata , in terms of neutral and adaptive genomic structure and its underlying \ncausal effects.\nA total of 203 samples from 13 locations (Fig. 1a) were processed, covering the species\u2019 distribution, using ddRADseq. \nOverall, 2,242 SNP\u2019s were obtained, 2,231 neutral and 9 potentially adaptive. The neutral structure identified two groups: \n1) California locations (PV , SCnaI, SCteI), and 2) Baja California Peninsula locations (GI, SJI, PCS, FS, CI, NI, PE, PuE, \nBA, SJ) (Fig 1b).

In the case of commercially important fish species, such as the gilthead seabream ( Sparus aurata ), \nthis is a matter of great concern and a major factor that affects production costs, downgrades hatcheries\u2019 production and fish \nmarket value. Among the solutions proposed to improve the skeletal deformities of aquaculture fish, the supplementation \nof their diet with natural compounds or extracts that stimulate skeletogenesis is increasingly seen as an economically sound \napproach to improve the competitiveness of the aquaculture industry and fish health. \nIn this regard, we supplemented a commercial fish diet with two ethanol extracts prepared from Skeletonema  sp. and \nTetraselmis sp. and containing bone anabolic compounds, and used them to feed gilthead seabream ( Sparus aurata ) \njuveniles of 4.8\u00b10.7 g until they tripled their weight. Fish were housed at the Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Piloto de Piscicultura de Olh\u00e3o \n(EPPO/IPMA) in 250-L rectangular tanks with water renewal of approximately 350 L per hour and a temperature of \n25.3\u00b11.0\u00baC, and fed ad libitum  3 to 4 times a day. \nConsidering fish growth performance indicators, dietary treatments had no impact on feed conversion rate (FCR), although \na slight increase was observed for fish fed with the diet supplemented with Skeletonema sp. extract. The total length was \nnot significantly altered in fish fed supplemented versus control diets, but a positive effect was observed on the weight of \nthe fish fed the diet supplemented with Tetraselmis  sp., which consequently show a moderate increased condition factor. \nThe analysis of several haematological parameters revealed that food supplementation with microalgae extracts does not \ninfluence fish physiological status or stress levels. In terms of bone parameters, the vertebrae of fish fed with the diet \ncontaining Skeletonema  sp. extract showed a higher phosphorous content, although the optimal balance between calcium \nand phosphorous was maintained in the vertebrae of fish fed supplemented diets. The analysis of the type and severity of the \nskeletal deformities revealed that most of them are associated with the caudal fin complex, independently of the treatment, \nbut that the incidence is reduced when fish are fed with the diets containing extract of Skeletonema  sp. (deformity charge \n(df) = 1) or Tetraselmis  sp. (df  = 1.17) when compared to the control diet (df = 1.36). The expression of several bone \nmarker genes was also altered upon dietary treatment, as it is the case of the osteoblast markers sp7 and col1a1 , that are, \nrespectively, up and downregulated for fish treated with Skeletonema  sp., and osteoclast marker acp5 , that is upregulated \nfor fish fed with Tetraselmis  sp. Interestingly, the expression of the glutathione peroxidase gpx1 was increased in the \nvertebrae of fish treated with both extracts, suggesting an activation of antioxidant mechanisms by both experimental \ndiets. Overall, the data gathered in this study points out to a general improvement of fish skeletal status upon dietary \ntreatment with microalgae extracts containing bone anabolic compounds, without compromising, and possibly improving, \nfish growth performance indicators. \nFunding\nThis study was funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) through the project \nUIDB/04326/2020 and by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF/FEAMP) through the National Operational \nProgramme MAR2020 and project OSTEOMAR MAR-02.01.01-FEAMP-0057.145\nDEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF EARLY AND FAST DIAGNOSTIC \nMETHODS TO PREVENT MARINE FISH DISEASE OUTBREAKS IN AQUACULTURE\nIris A.

Thus, an early and efficient detection of the classical and emerging pathologies (including virus, \nbacteria, parasites) is essential.\nThe molecular methodologies (commonly known as \u201comic tools\u201d) have gained much importance as invaluable tools to \nassess the welfare and health of farmed organisms. These \u201comic tools\u201d can be used to develop databases with the signature \nof the major pathogens to allow the  detection, identification and/or quantification of pathogenic agents in a faster and more \nreliable  way, complementing the classical biochemical methodologies, directly impacting on the success of an aquaculture \nproduction.  \n \nTaking this into account, the strategy outlines in this work was to provide pathogen detection and identification by using \nmolecular tools, such as PCR.  Sequence data available in public databases was used to designed oligonucleotide primers \nthat could specifically detect several bacteria species found in aquacultures in the Mediterranean, such as Photobacterium \ndamselae , Tenacibaculum maritimum, Aeromonas salmonicida, Aeromonas hydrophila,  and several subspecies of Vibrios , \nnamely V . harveyi, V . anguillarum, V . pelagius, V . vulnificus, V . splendidus, and V . fischeri. \nFor a fastest detection of Vibrio sub-species, a multiplex PCR was used in which a combination of primers allowed for the \nspecific detection of each vibrio in different samples. This reflects the usefulness of these protocols in the detection of the \ncorrect sub-specie while being time saving. \nAltogether, our results show that a faster and more reliable detection of different pathogens in aquaculture can be performed \nfor several bacteria and parasite species. Our results can also lead to the development of novel preventive and treatment \nmeasures, as well as mitigation tools, with the objective of control fish diseases, with subsequent reduction of economic \nlosses for the aquaculture industry. \nThis study had the support of the projects DIVERSIAQUA II (Mar2020-P02M01-0656P) and SAUDE&AQUA (MAR \n02.05.01 FEAMP 0009).146\nS2AQUAcoLAB: A JOINT VENTURE THAT BRIDGES RESEARCH AND INDUSTRY TO \nFOSTER AQUACULTURE\u2019S DEVELOPMENT\nC\u00e1tia Louren\u00e7o-Marques1,2, Pedro Pous\u00e3o-Ferreira1,2\n1 S2AQUA Collaborative Laboratory, Association for a Smart and Sustainable Aquaculture.

They represent a valuable source of bioactive \ncompounds: polyphenols, pigments, peptides and polysaccharides that are associated with several health benefits and \nbiological activities. Food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries are constantly working to find natural, non-toxic \ncompounds that can be used in their products.\nIn this study, we evaluated the antioxidant activity of two (methanolic F3 and dichlormethane F4) different fractions \nfrom macroalga Halopteris scoparia  in order to determine differences between harvesting season. Total protein content, \nchlorophyll and carotenoid content were determined. Also, several methods were used for evaluation of antioxidant activity. \nThe semipurified fractions were also tested for antimicrobial activity using broth microdilution method for quantitative \nassessment and the toxicity of samples was determined using the zebrafish embryotoxicity test up to 96 h of embryonal \ndevelopment in order to reveal the safety of their usage and further implementation. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was \nused to correlate obtained results for antioxidant activity.  \nAll methanolic fractions showed higher antioxidant activity than the dichloromethane fractions of same season by \nimplementing 3 different antioxidants assays, namely reduction of the radical cation (ABTS), the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-\nhydrazyl (DPPH) and the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays. April sample of H. scoparia  (HASC) \nmethanolic fraction (F3) showed the highest activity (268.6\u00b120.6 mg AAE/g fraction) followed by HASC F4 April and \nHASC F3 February samples by DPPH method (Fig.1a). By using ABTS assay, the highest activity was observed for HASC \nF3 February followed by F3 April and F3 July fractions (Fig.1b). The highest protein value was observed for Halopteris \nscoparia  April sample (20.5%) followed by HASC July (19.7%) and February (14.3%) samples. Chloropyll a and its \nderivate pheophytin a are dominant pigments in all three samples and the highest pigment content (chloropyll a and b, \npheophytine a and b and carotenoids) was observed for HASC February sample. \nObtained results indicate that harvesting season has a crutial role in obtaining samples with best properties that have a \npotential to be used as a source of natural antioxidants in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry .\n148\nTRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF REPRODUCTIVE \nTRACT TISSUES OF MALE RIVER PRAWN Macrobrachium americanum\nMiriam V .

(CIBNOR) \nLa Paz, Baja California Sur, 23205, Mexico\nmiriamvmm@hotmail.com\nThe river prawn, Macrobrachium americanum (M. americanum) , is a large amphidromous species distributed along the \nPacific coast of America.  This prawn has commercial value due to its size and taste, making it a good option for aquaculture \nproduction. Sustainable prawn production requires a constant supply of high-quality hatchery  and laboratory-reared larvae . \nTo raise prawn larvae, the quality of adult reproduction is critical. The basic concepts of M. americanum  reproduction have \nbegun to be unraveled, but our knowledge of the mechanism that regulates reproduction at the molecular level is limited. To \naddress this issue, we performed transcriptome assembly and differential expression analysis among testes, vas deferens, \nand terminal ampulla of M. americanum. \nAdult males of  M. americanum were captured in an estuary and a river located in Tomatl\u00e1n, Jalisco and Puerto Vallarta, \nJalisco, respectively. Total RNA extraction was performed using the TRIsure reagent following the manufacturer\u00b4s \nguidelines with modifications. Approximately one \u00b5g of high-quality RNA was used to prepare cDNA libraries, using \nthe Zymo-Seq RiboFreeTM Total RNA Library kit. The libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 platform (2 x 150 bp) \nby genomic service provider Novogene. The sequences were evaluated to determine their quality with FastQC software, \nand the adapters were removed using the SeqPrep software to obtain clean readings. A combined transcriptome with \nthe three tissues was constructed using Trinity software. Sequences were compared against Swissprot and nonredundant \nMacrobrachium sp. databases and Gene Ontology (GO) databases using BLASTx and Blast2GO. Differential expression \nanalysis among tissues was executed using EdgeR\nThe transcriptome assembly generated 1,059,447 unigenes, of which 7,222 genes had significant hits (e-value < 1x10-5) \nwhen compared against the Swissprot database. Based on Swissprot annotation, a total of 6,271 unigenes were annotated \nin GO, which were classified into three functional categories: cellular components (6,741), molecular functions (8,625), \nand biological process (40,628). About 20% of unigenes annotated in GO were involved in a reproductive process or \nreproduction within the category of biological processes.  Based on Gene Ontology classification and comparison with \ndata from other publications, about 70 genes were related to sex determination, testis development, spermatogenesis, \nspermiogenesis, fertilization, maturation of testicular cells, neuropeptides, hormones, hormone receptors, and/or \nembryogenesis. Differential expression analysis showed 179 transcripts differentially expressed (FDR < 0.05, Log2FC >1)  \namong the tissues.\nThese results provide new molecular information about M. americanum  reproduction, representing a reference point for \nfurther genetic studies of this species .149\nHYPER INTENSIVE SHRIMP FARM IN TAMAULIPAS, M\u00c9XICO\nNowadays, there is a great business opportunity in the shrimp aquaculture in Mexico, due to the important growth of its \ndemand y and prices both in Mexico and the USA.

Tilapia was farmed in tanks (500 L), with \nand without bioflocs incorporated. The bioflocs were produced in a transparent tank (500 L) inoculated with the microalgae \nScenedesmus oblicuos  and wheat brand. The effluents were passed to PVC tubes for the hydroponic culture of jalape\u00f1o \npepper ( Capsicum annum ). The final effluent was used to a fertigation culture of mini bell pepper ( Capsicum annum ). The \nproduction response of tilapia in terms of weight gain, survival, biomass and FCR, was little better in tanks with bioflocs \n(Table 1). The jalape\u00f1o pepper had not a good performance in the hydroponics system in terms of plan height, survival, \nnumber of fruits per plant and days for flowering (Table 2). Contrarily, mini bell pepper showed a better performance  \n(Table 3). \nWe concluded that our experimental flocponics system could be more efficient, but some adjustments need to be done.\n152\nTHE EFFECT OF REARING TEMPERATURE ON MEAGRE (Argyrosomus regius ) GROWTH \nPERFORMANCE DURING LARV AL AND EARLY JUVENILE STAGES\nC\u00e1tia Louren\u00e7o-Marques*, Ana Candeias-Mendes, Sara Castanho, Marisa Barata, Sara Sousa e Brito, \nMafalda Rocha, Margarida Gamboa, Leticia Luj\u00e1n, Florbela Soares, Laura Ribeiro, Pedro Pous\u00e3o-Ferreira\nIPMA - Portuguese Institute for the Ocean and Atmosphere, EPPO - Aquaculture Research Station\nAv.

Additionally, meagre is a species easily adapted to captivity and well-known by the consumers, presenting a high \ncommercial value, making it an interesting species for aquaculture production.\nAt the Aquaculture Research Station of Olh\u00e3o (EPPO), an aquaculture facility from the Portuguese Institute for the Ocean \nand Atmosphere (IPMA) dedicated to perform pre-industrial studies, several trials have been conducted to address questions \nrelated to meagre rearing and along the years one of the most common question raised was which is the best rearing \ntemperature for meagre. Although the normal spawning temperature rounds the 20\u00baC, the optimal rearing temperature, to \nenhance larvae and juvenile growth, seems to be situated a couple degrees above, which makes meagre a suitable species \nto grow in recirculation systems (RAS), at higher and controlled temperatures. This issue is particularly important in the \ncontext of the foundation of the S2AQUAcoLAB (in 2021), a collaborative laboratory, that brings together research and \nindustry partners, with the main objective of fostering the development of the aquaculture sector in Portugal and which \nhas, among several other areas of research, interest in the implementation and optimization of recirculation culture systems.\nIn this work we present the results of several trials performed to determine the better growing temperature for meagre \nlarvae and juveniles, which for larvae is around 22 and for early juveniles is located between 24 and 28\u00baC.

CP 86990 \neamqm60@gmail.com \nMexico has a huge diversity of freshwater fishes, with at least 160 species, including 50 genders and 30 families, mainly \nlocated in the south eastern part of the country. Of these, just a few of them have been studied and developed for aquaculture, \nhowever, not even this very few have been fully utilised for regional aquaculture advance, despite the fact that they could \nbe grown using the already existing Tilapia facilities, hence, could be used as a mean to increase, diversify and improve \nproduction and benefits for many fish farmers.\nAquaculture research of native species with potential in aquaculture in Mexico began in the earlys 80\u00b4s, involving many \ninstitutions and personnel, this led to the organization of national and international Seminars in 1988, 1994 and 2006. \nResults showed that there was aquaculture technology for some of the big cichlids and the gar, as well as the many \necological and socioeconomical benefits of their exploitation. Market was also a matter, as prices were always higher than \ntilapia and demand was often unsatisfied, for instance.\nToday, all the reasons that were argued as beneficial for native fish culture not only remain but have been increased, e.g., \nfisheries supply is shorter, prices continue to rise as well as the consumer demand. In addition, aquaculture as a sector has \nalso grown in the region, so we have more and better feeds, technicians, services and growing facilities. \nThis paper presents regional examples were the culture of Castarrica Cichlasoma urophthalmus , Paleta Vieja sinspyla  and \nGar Atractosteus tropicus  as well as fisheries restocking programs including this species and tilapia can be a sustainable and \nvery profitable aquaculture alternative for the region. Special emphasis is given to point out some of the many technological, \nmarketing and economical strengths of the culture of this native fishes.160\nEFFECTIVENESS OF AN RECIRCULATION AQUACULTURE SYSTEM (RAS) IN THE \nQUARANTINE AND MATURATION OF WHITE LEG SHRIMP BROODSTOCK  Litopenaeus \nvannamei Boone, 1931\nJos\u00e9 Luis Arzabala Molina* ; Rosa Le\u00f3n Medina; Luc\u00eda Soto Simental; Luis Enrique Espinoza Buitimea; Urbano \nGonz\u00e1lez Gazga\nNational Technology of Mexico campus Lerma\nCampeche, M\u00e9xico 24500\njose.am@lerma.tecnm.mx\nA specially designed recirculation aquaculture system (RAS) was used to maintain a batch of Litopenaeus vannamei \nwhite leg shrimp broodstock in quarantine, maturation, reproduction and spawning. The objective was to determine the \neffectiveness of the RAS by monitoring the physical and chemical parameters of seawater quality and recording the \nbiological production parameters.\nThe supply of shrimp broodstock from a genetic nucleus of lines tolerant to specific viral diseases and with improvements \nin growth is a necessary biosecurity measure to respond to the requirements of shrimp producers regarding the supply of \nhealthy shrimp postlarvae. Their reproductive performance was evaluated in an operation period of 144 days, since the \nimport of a batch of 450 reproducers from a commercial genetic nucleus of 2 lines of shrimp reproducers with an average \nweight of 30 grams: SPARTAN -tolerance to diseases- (234 organisms: 142 females and 92 males) and FURIOS -improved \ngrowth- (216 organisms: 144 females and 72 males).\nThe variables were the physicochemical parameters of seawater: temperature, hydrogen potential, ammonia nitrogen and \nalkalinity. The biological parameters were recorded: Survival, percentage of copulations, fertilization and hatching. The \nrecirculation percentage was 95% with 5% replacement. The physical parameters described a stable behavior and within \nthe requirements of the species; without presenting a significant difference (p> 0.05) between the RAS and the production \ntanks, but with respect to seawater. The recorded measurements of the chemical parameters did show a significant difference \n(p <0.05) between them, with better results in the RAS designed for this purpose. The data obtained from the biological \nparameters of production showed how the SPARTANs are significantly better (p <0.05) in their performance compared to \nthe FURIOS (Fig. 1).\nIt was possible to establish the effectiveness of the system to maintain the quality of the water during the period of quarantine, \nmaturation, reproduction and spawning of shrimp, at commercially acceptable levels; with an adapted equipment, reducing \nthe investment and in a vinculation Institute:Company for the formation of human capital.\nThis level of reduction allows the supply of nauplii destined for the biosafety production of shrimp postlarvae, without \nthe use of large quantities of seawater; thereby reducing the coastal environmental impact, preventing the occurrence \nof the introduction-dispersal of exotic diseases to the environment and the probability of the entry of vectors from the \nenvironment to the production facilities.\n161\nDETERMINATION OF THE SURVIV AL AND GROWTH OF OYSTER SEED Crassostrea \nvirginica  IN THE SOTO LA MARINA RIVER\nIsidro Otoniel Montelongo-Alfaro* Jorge Homero Rodr\u00edguez-Castro, Alfonso Correa-Sandoval,  \nJaime Luis R\u00e1bago-Castro, Gaspar Manuel Parra-Bracamonte\nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Cd.

La bioeconom\u00eda constituye la primera oportunidad de implementar una econom\u00eda global realmente sostenible \nbasada en recursos biol\u00f3gicos, que, gracias a las biotecnolog\u00edas se convierten en renovables. \nUno de los grandes desaf\u00edos en la acuicultura, es la selecci\u00f3n de especies de peces marinos candidatas para esta actividad. \nEl robalo representa uno de los recursos m\u00e1s importantes de la pesca ribere\u00f1a multiespec\u00edfica en los sistemas lagunares. Sin \nembargo, su producci\u00f3n no satisface la demanda del mercado nacional. La soluci\u00f3n es implementar sistemas de producci\u00f3n \npara determinar el desempe\u00f1o de la especie y con ello, evaluar la rentabilidad de la misma. \nDesde los a\u00f1os ochenta la acuicultura se ha convertido en una actividad de r\u00e1pido crecimiento a nivel mundial. Esta \nactividad contribuye al r\u00e1pido aumento de la oferta de pescado, pretendiendo compensar el agotamiento de las poblaciones \nde peces naturales del mundo. Sin embargo, no ha podido contribuir del todo, ya que no ha podido frenar el colapso que \nenfrenta m\u00e1s del 50% de las pesquer\u00edas existentes en el Pacifico mexicano. (Beltr\u00e1n Meza, 2017).\nM\u00e9xico se proyecta a mediano plazo, como potencia mundial en la actividad por acuicultura, debido a que en los \u00faltimos \na\u00f1os la tasa media de crecimiento ha sido del 15% anual, alcanzando en 2016, cifras hist\u00f3ricas de 337 mil toneladas de \nproducci\u00f3n por acuicultura, representando esto el 22% en la actividad pesquera del pa\u00eds.\nSin embargo, a pesar de contar con las condiciones necesarias y el potencial suficiente para hacer de esta actividad \nuna fortaleza, su crecimiento ha sido moderado y no ha logrado adquirir la suficiente relevancia como en los pa\u00edses \nindustrializados (INAES, 2018).\nEs por ello que el an\u00e1lisis bioecon\u00f3mico en la acuicultura surge como respuesta a la necesidad de integrar factores \necon\u00f3micos, biol\u00f3gicos, t\u00e9cnicos y ambientales para mejorar la eficiencia y toma de decisiones a nivel empresarial. \nDebido a la complejidad de los sistemas de producci\u00f3n acu\u00edcola y los numerosos desaf\u00edos impuestos por el r\u00e1pido \ncrecimiento de esta industria, son necesarios implementar y desarrollar modelos integrales, con el objetivo de proporcionar \ninformaci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica y alternativas a los productores.\n(Continued on next page)163\nEl desarrollo de sistemas de producci\u00f3n acu\u00edcola es una soluci\u00f3n, para suministrar alimento, contribuir a la econom\u00eda \nen la generaci\u00f3n de empleo e ingresos. Para ello, se utilizan modelos matem\u00e1ticos, los cuales, son t\u00e9cnicas usadas en el \ndesempe\u00f1o de sistemas de producci\u00f3n biol\u00f3gica sujetos a restricciones econ\u00f3micas, biol\u00f3gicas y t\u00e9cnicos en los mercados.\nObjetivo general. Evaluar el potencial bioecon\u00f3mico de las tres especies de robalo en el Pac\u00edfico mexicano (C.nigrescens, \nC.viridis, C.medius) mediante an\u00e1lisis pesqueros y modelos financieros.\nEstrategia metodol\u00f3gica.

To do this, we had to solve several bottleneck \nissues such as:\n \u2022 Broodstock management to obtain high quality year-round without hormones;\n \u2022 Egg incubation crashes;\n \u2022 Post-hatch sinking larvae;\n \u2022 First feeding mortalities;\n \u2022 High quality rotifers in massive production;\n \u2022 Improvement in deformity rates;\n \u2022 High intake water temperature management (up to 30 Celsius);\n \u2022 Specific pathogens with high temperature environments; and\n \u2022 Fish welfare principles applied to Seriola rivoliana .\nThe marine aquaculture industry (mariculture) in Mexico has been an individual effort for all of the companies involved, \nthe lack of peripherical services related to the offshore operations, and hatchery supplies has been a bottle neck that got \nworse during and after COVID shut down where the fragility of the chain supply was evidenced. Besides the lost of \ncostumers during this period, research and development was set to stand by, we had to adapt to the new reality, looking for \na way to get directly to the consumer and being able to be more efficient in the production operations with what we have \nwith the minimum technical staff available.\nOne of our greatest milestones was the use of a RAS system for larvae culture in the hot weather seasons and has been now \nthe way we have outcome covid shutdown with juvenile production before transferring fish to of fshore.  \nAfter covid hatchery improvement opportunities.\nDuring the 2020 covid lockdown, we had to leave on stand by all the non-essential research activities, when the production \nstatus was at the lowest point. Now we are starting to assess priorities with the following improvement points:\n \u2022 Qrill fish meal and oil to enhance immune system in juveniles before transferring to of fshore.\n \u2022 AI technology development for small juvenile sorting.\n \u2022 Genetic breeding program for broodstock management improvement.\n \u2022 BAP certifications process.\n \u2022 Whole hatchery scale up phase.165\nASSESSMENT OF ANTIBIOTICS RESIDUES IN AFRICAN CATFISH Clarias gariepinus  \nFROM AQUAFARMS IN IBADAN, NIGERIA\nBabatunde O.

This study was designed to investigate the prevalence and concentrations \nof frequently used antibiotics (Enrofloxacin, Gentamicin and Tetracycline) by farmers in catfish grow-out production in \nIbadan, a major hub of catfish cultivation in Nigeria. \nSimple random sampling technique was used to select three (3) Local Government Areas (LGAs) namely, Iddo, Ibadan \nNorthwest and Akinyele. Proportionate sampling technique was employed to select forty (40) fish farms from where eighty \n(80) samples of marketable African Catfish C. gariepinus  (475\u00b17.58g) were collected for laboratory analysis. Antibiotic \nresidues in the fish muscles were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\nAll the fish samples (100%) contained residues of Gentamicin and Tetracycline while 76% of the samples had residues of \nEnrofloxacin. Further, the average concentrations of Enrofloxacin, Gentamicin and Tetracycline in the fish muscles were \n17.27\u00b11.72 \u03bcg/kg, 40.52\u00b12.95 \u03bcg/kg and 198.40\u00b19.3 \u03bcg/kg, respectively. None of the catfish samples had concentrations \nof Enrofloxacin and Gentamicin above the allowable limits (100 \u03bcg/kg), whereas there was preponderance of Tetracycline \nconcentrations, and above allowable limit (200 \u03bcg/kg). \nThe high prevalence and concentrations of the considered antibiotic residues in the sampled fish give room for food \nsafety concerns because of the long-term public health effects. It is imperative that the use of antimicrobial agents in fish \nproduction be regulated, and that programs for responsible aquaculture be developed. \n166\nDETERMINATION OF A PREDICTIVE GROWTH MODEL FOR CULTIV ATED AFRICAN \nCATFISH Clarias gariepinus  (Burchell, 1882)\nBabatunde O.

In order to improve its rearing systems, it is imperative to determine the individual growth \npatterns of the species. Individual fish growth is relevant when evaluating commercial viability, planning the time of \nharvest or projecting profits.  \nIn this study, we analysed the growth data of African catfish juveniles reared in an indoor freshwater recirculation \naquaculture system and fed five different commercial aquafeeds over a period of 111 days. We fitted five nonlinear growth \nmodels\u2014von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, Brody, Richards and Logistic\u2014to the weight data and applied the Akaike information \ncriterion, the sum of squares and the maximum likelihood to determine the model that best describes the growth data of the \nspecies under the controlled culture conditions. \nAccording to the goodness-of- fit criteria, the Gompertz model was consistently the one that best described the growth of \nAfrican catfish. The F-test showed significant differences (p = 0.05) for one of the experimental feeds (T1,2) that produced \nthe superior growth in terms of rate and biomass.\n167\nAPPLICATIONS OF BIOINFORMATICS TOOLS ANALYSIS  FOR GENE \nREGULATORY  NETWORKS INVOLVED IN SEXUAL MATURATION OF RAINBOW \nTROUT ( Onchorhynchus  mykiss ) \nSajad Nazari*1; Mahdi Golshan2; Saltanat Najjar Lashgari3: Seyed Amin Mortazavi1; \nMohammad Meysam Salahi Ardakani1; Seyed Hossein Moradiyan1\n1Shahid Motahary Cold-water Fishes Genetic and Breeding Research Center, Iranian Fisheries Sciences Research \nInstitute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Yasouj, Iran\n2Iranian Fisheries Sciences Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization \n(AREEO), Tehran, Iran \n3Cold-water Fishes Research Center, Iranian Fisheries Sciences Research Institute, Agricultural Research, \nEducation and Extension Organization (AREEO), Tonekabon, Iran \n*corresponding e-mail:sajadnazari13@gmail.com\nIn the present study, we used bioinformatics approach and compare gene regulatory networks using microarray data \nto identify gene expression differences in sexual maturity traits of rainbow trout ( Onchorhynchus  mykiss ). The gene \nexpression profiles of sexual maturity were investigated and compared based on microarray gene analysis. We identified \nputative related  signaling pathway  and interaction networks associated with sexual maturation. Differentially expressed \ngenes (DEGs) and Gene Ontology analysis were applied to identify protein encoded and then signaling pathway \ninvolvement using and gene functions were clustered using WEBGSAL, Bnlearn, Cytohubba and Cytoscape softwares. \nA total of 174 significant genes were differentially expressed at more than a two-fold change in fish were treated without \nfeeding as compared to regular feeding. Of these, 94 upregulated genes and 80 downregulated genes were confirmed. \nThe results showed that the genes BRCA2, DCT, EDC3, GJA1B, CFL2, CFD, MELTF, ZNF33B, SEC24D and PIPE had \nsignificant effects on sexual maturation and related to reproductive process. The results of the present study indicate that the \nbioinformatics microarray analysis  could provide important data regarding molecular mechanisms of reproductive process \nfor future experimental investigations.168\nMETA-ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE  TRAIT  LOCI (QTLS) REVEALS THE GENETIC \nCONTROL OF GROWTH-RELATED TRAITS  IN FARMED RAINBOW TROUT \n(Onchorhynchus  mykiss )\nSajad Nazari*1; Mahdi Golshan3; Saltanat Najjar Lashgari4; Mohammad Meysam Salahi Ardakani1; \nMaryam Mirbakhsh3; Salman Malekpour Kolbadinejad4; Seyed Hosseini Moradiyan1; Esmaeil Kazemi1; \nEisa Falahat Naserabad1 \n1Shahid Motahary Cold-water Fishes Genetic and Breeding Research Center, Iranian Fisheries Sciences Research \nInstitute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Yasouj, Iran\n2Iranian Fisheries Sciences Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization \n(AREEO), Teharn, Iran\n3Cold-water Fishes Research Center, Iranian Fisheries Sciences Research Institute, Agricultural Research, \nEducation and Extension Organization (AREEO), Tonekabon, Iran\n*corresponding e-mail:sajadnazari13@gmail.com\nThe field of association mapping studies has recently received major attention for genetic studies of quantitative traits in \nmany important aquatic species. Access to next generation sequencing technologies, high phenotypic data and a variety of \nsophisticated statistical tools have enabled association mapping studies in aquatic species to be successful in identifying \ngene loci controlling quantitative traits. Due to the importance of association mapping method in mapping studies of the \nquantitative traits, the present project was prepared to explain the association mapping method and its use in rainbow \ntrout breeding and also to perform a meta-analysis of these QTL to identify regions of the rainbow trout genome that are \nconsistently associated with growth traits. To identify Meta-QTL (MQTL), a QTL database was developed from 1400 \nQTL targeted at growth traits. This project also provides some information about statistical software packages used in \nassociation mapping and then the opportunities and challenges of association mapping and post-genome wide association \nstudies at the whole genome level discussed. For QTL mapped relative to a single marker, nucleotide sequence of the \nmarker was retrieved from the relevant marker database. For QTL mapped relative to two flanking markers, sequences for \nboth flanking markers were retrieved from the database. The positions of individual QTL were projected onto a consensus \ngenetic map based on the presence of common molecular markers and a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for \neach QTL. After positioning the individual QTL, the software \u2018Biomercator v2.1\u2019 was used to predict the location and CI of \nMQTL based on maximum likelihood. In total, 854 QTL were reported for 80 growth traits. This included 280 for average \ndaily gain (ADG), 16 for body weight (BW), 9 for Condition factor (CF) and 7 for fork length (FL) trait QTL in rainbow \ntrout genome. In total, 27 QTLs were detected on four linkage groups for the studied traits. That from 2 to 23/8% of the \nphenotypic variation (LOD) were justified. Most QTLs were detected on 13 linkage groups. In this study, for the body \nheight traits not detected a QTL. Results revealed the existence of co-localized QTLs for studied traits, which enhance the \nefficiency of marker-assisted selection and developing rainbow trout breeding programs  \n169\nIN VITRO STUDY OF GREEN SYNTHESIZE NANOPARTICLE FROM Terminalia catappa  \nAS CANDIDATE ANTIBACTERIAL PATHOGEN IN AQUACULTURE FIELD\nRudy Agung Nugroho*, Eko Kusumawati, Noor Hindryawati, Retno Aryani, Islami Indra Nurani, \nHetty Manurung, Rudianto Rudianto, Widha Prahastika  \nFaculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Mulawarman University , \nJl.

This study aims to identify six Abalone insulin-like peptides of northern \nabalone through transcriptome sequencing and to confirm changes after feeding through the expression levels of these \npeptides. Furthermore, RNA-Seq data was utilized to further explore the expression patterns of AIPs, which may help \nuncover vital functions of Pacific abalone. Based on the above analysis, six insulin like-peptides were analyzed each hour \nafter feeding. this study showed a relative increase in AIP1-5 expression in hepatopancreas 3 h after feeding compared to \nother tissues. In most of the experimental groups, the expression levels before feeding were restored after 6 h. However, \nAIP6 showed the highest relative expression level after 1 h, and then decreased after 3 h of feeding. This is the first report \nshowing the uptake of feed influence on the expression of insulin-like peptide in abalone species and it is assumed that a \nphysiological regulatory mechanism using insulin-like peptides may exist in H. discus hannai  endocrine system.171\nTENDENCIAS FENOT\u00cdPICAS PARA SUPERVIVENCIA Y PESO A LA COSECHA EN \nUNA POBLACI\u00d3N DE CAMAR\u00d3N BLANCO DEL PAC\u00cdFICO Litopenaeus vannamei   BAJO \nSELECCI\u00d3N\nOrdo\u00f1ez Ram\u00edrez Jos\u00e9 Manuel, Alejandra Caballero-Zamora*, Thania Medrano-Mendoza, \nPsique V .

Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia\nesther18panda@gmail.com\nFish is considered a meat of important biological value as it represents a valuable source of high quality animal protein; \nthis protein is highly digestible and provides all the essential amino acids required by humans. The amino acids are the \nfundamental constituents of the protein, and those that are present in the food are the decisive ones to determine the quality \nof the protein of the tilapia fillet. Of the 20 existing amino acids, 10 can be synthesized by the body (non-essential), and the \nrest need to be supplied to the body through the diet (essential). The Nile gray tilapia is one of the most consumed species \nin the world, it has characteristics that allow its cultivation in sustainable systems with little or no water exchange, such \nas the biofloc system, which provides a supplement in the nutrition of cultivated organisms. The biofloc not only provides \ncomplementary food in situ , but also produces extracellular enzymes that break down proteins, carbohydrates and other \nnutritional ingredients, facilitating the digestibility and absorption of the food. The type of diet offered to farmed fish has \na significant effect on the nutrient composition of the meat, and can be adapted to produce a desirable nutrient profile \nin the farmed species. To determine the effect of the biofloc system on the amino acid in fillet of the Nile gray tilapia \nOreochromis niloticus , an experiment was carried out for 120 days, with two treatments and three repetitions: traditional \nsystem (TS) and heterotrophic biofloc system (BFT). Male monosex organisms with initial average weight of 109 \u00b1 39.29 \ng were used at a stocking density of 100 fish m-3, fed with extruded pellets with 32% CP. In the present work, nine of the \nten essential amino acids were analyzed in the tilapia fillet; where six of these (lysine, threonine, methionine, isoleucine, \nleucine and phenylalanine) were present in a higher proportion in the tilapia fillet grown in the biofloc system ( Table 1 ). \nWith the results obtained in the present work, it is concluded that the biofloc system has influence in the protein quality of \nthe meat due to the consume of the microrganisms presents contributes a constant nutritional supplement compared with \nthe traditional system.\n174\nBIOTECHNOLOGICAL POTENTIAL OF MARINE BACTERIA ISOLATED FROM \nEUTROPHIC SEA PIT IN THE ADRIATIC SEA\n  \nT.

The samples of the degrading biomass were collected at 19 m and 29 \nm depth and incubated at 16 \u00b0C on 13 different solid media to recover culturable microbes adapted to this niche. Isolates \nwere identified using either MALDI-TOF MS or 16S rDNA and were tested for antibacterial and antifungal activity. \nDifferent extracellular enzymatic activities of isolates were assessed with specific substrates for proteases, esterases, \nlipases, amylases, cellulases, and chitinases. Out of 298 cultivable isolates across 13 media, 67 isolates exhibited 99% \n16S rRNA gene sequence identity to Alcanivorax borkumensis (\u03b3-proteobacteria). Analysis of rpoB sequences from four \nAlcanivorax  isolates displayed 90% similarity to A. borkumensis  suggesting so far unreported species. This genus is known \nto thrive on petroleum and is therefore useful for biodegradation of oil spills. Our isolates showed strong esterase and lipase \nactivities. This microorganism can tolerate up to 10% salt in medium supplemented with 1% of oil and form specific mold-\nlike hydrophobic clumps at the liquid medium surface. Confocal time-lapse microscopy has shown that this bacterium can \ncolonize oil droplets more rapidly than A. borkumensis (Fig. 1B). Different assays revealed capacity of this bacterium to \ndegrade various hydrocarbon substrates. The currently ongoing whole genome sequencing will reveal a more complete \narsenal of enzymes associated with oil bioremediation and other metabolic processes.   \n175\nNEGATIVE EFFECT OF ECTOPARASITE BURDENS ON THE CONDITION FACTOR \nFROM FARMED TILAPIA Oreochromis niloticus IN THE YUCATAN, MEXICO\nAmelia Paredes Trujillo*, Ivan Velazquez-Abunader, Vanesa Papiol Nieves, Rodolfo E. del Rio-Rodr\u00edguez, \nV\u00edctor Manuel Vidal-Mart\u00ednez\nInstituto EPOMEX, Universidad Autonoma de Campeche, Av.

Buenavista 24039, \nCampeche, Mexico\nE-mail address: amelia.paredes@unach.mx\nNile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus  Linnaeus, 1758) is one of the most important aquaculture species in the world, and, \nwhen introduced, the ectoparasites of Nile tilapia have followed. Currently, farmers worldwide consider these ectoparasites \nharmless, but intensities can reach up to 1,000 individuals per fish in tropical regions. In this cross-sectional study, we used \nthe condition factor to estimate the potential effects of low (45 \u00b1 31 ectoparasites per fish) and high (295 \u00b1 191) ectoparasitic \nburdens across 28 tilapia farms and included the analysis of the effects of 44 management and environmental variables \nfrom the farms. A stepwise procedure in a multiple linear regression analysis retained the variables that explained the most \nvariance, which was the ectoparasitic burden (57%). We found significantly higher values of the condition factor in Nile \ntilapia with low ectoparasitic burden than in those with high ectoparasitic burden. Additionally, Nile tilapia with a high \nectoparasitic burden weighed less than half than those with a low burden (102 \u00b1 105 g versus 230 \u00b1 128 g, respectively). We \nalso found a significant non-linear, negative relationship between the ectoparasitic burden and the relative condition factor \nvalues per fish, which was most likely due to an increase in gill mucus caused by the ectoparasitic burden that depleted \nenergy in the Nile tilapia. The economic consequence of the ectoparasitic burden translated roughly into a loss up to 12-\n15% in profit margin per ton of fish, based on the price of Nile tilapia in the Mexican market. 176\nWEIGHT-LENGHT RELATIONSHIP OF Ictalurus punctatus  AND Pangasius hypophthalmus  \nCATFISHES IN COMMERCIAL EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS\nG.

Weight \nLength relationship (WLR) is an useful that can be used for converting lengths into biomass, determining the fish condition, \ncomparing fish growth among areas, and complement to species-specific reproduction and feeding studies. An experiment \nwas conducted submmiting fishes to growth-out conditions during 40 days using 1 m3 floating cages (three repetitions by \npopulation) at a density of 250 fishes/m3. Using final weights and furcal lengths, double logarithmic regression models \nwere fitted to estimate a and b parameters. Fulton condition factor (K) was estimated. \nThe Figure 1, shows the logarithmic plots of data from Local Channel Catfish and Basa. The line of prediction estimated a \nb=3.02 (R2>0.95) indicating isometric growth. Basa population WLR had a slightly lower b parameter (b= 2.92, R2>0.95) \nthat suggest a relative negative allometric of hipo-allometric, and can be interpreted as fishes that weigh less than their \nlength predicts or, related to the better feeding condition of small organisms at the time of sampling. K for Channel \nCatfish and Basa catfish populations, were 1.84\u00b10.127 and 1.65\u00b10.179, respectively, with no statistical differences between \npopulations (P>0.05). The results indicates good and similar growth potential under commercial conditions and estimates \ncan be used as reference information or prediction of biomass under commercial conditions. \n177\nCOMPARATIVE STUDY OF ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES IN BLOOD SAMPLES OF \nCOMMON SNOOK, Centropomus undecimalis\nCristina Pascual*,  Jaime Suarez, Pedro Gallardo, Ariadna S\u00e1nchez, Honorio Cruz & Adolfo S\u00e1nchez \npascual.cristina@ciencias.unam.mx\nUniversidad Nacional Aut \u00f3noma de M \u00e9xico, Facultad de Ciencias, Unidad Multidisciplinaria de Docencia \ne Investigaci \u00f3n, Sisal, Hunucm \u00e1, Mexico\nThe white sea bass, Centropomus undecimalis , is a species of fishing importance that inhabits coastal lagoons and river \nmouths during its juvenile stage. It is a species with high potential for cultivation, for which it is essential to monitor \nits nutritional and health status. In this work, clinical diagnostic analytical techniques were compared using blood to \ncharacterize nutritional status and physiological status.\n36 organisms cultivated in the marine fish area of UNAM, Sisal Unit, were used. The fish were anesthetized (eugenol), \nand the blood sample was obtained by puncture in the caudal vein. Plasma metabolites were evaluated using clinical \ndiagnostic kits, Accutrend Plus test and refractive index to compare the concentration of total protein, glucose, lactate, \ncholesterol, and acyl glycerides. Immunological status was also determined by hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, \nand hemagglutinating activity. A paired analysis was performed to compare analytical techniques (diagnostic kits and test \nstrips), and the effect of sample preservation time (fresh and 24 hours).\nThe results indicate that there is a significant effect by the type of evaluation, and also by the preservation time of the \nsample (p < 0.05). Thus, the results indicate a decrease in the concentration of metabolites and hemagglutinating activity in \nsamples preserved in refrigeration, indicating that comparative studies should consider the analytical technique used, and \nalso the preservation time of the sample in refrigeration.\nThe data obtained agree with values reported in wild organisms of the same species, indicating the possibility of using \nblood components as indicators of physiological status for nutritional studies and to monitor wild or ganisms.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was funded by the financial support of National Autonomous University of Mexico (PAPIIT IN217322; \nIT201621)\n178\nEFECTO DEL HONGO Ganoderma lucidum SOBRE LA SALUD DEL CAMAR \u00d3N Litopenaeus \nvannamei CULTIV ADO EN ECUADOR\n*Sonnya Mendoza Lombana\nsonnya.mendoza@ gmail.com\nNatalia Gonz\u00e1lez\nnatalia.gonzalez@premexcorp.com\nSergio Giraldo \nsergio.giraldo @premexcorp.com\nEl Ecuador  se convirti\u00f3 en el primer productor de camarones a nivel mundial en el 2021, con un total de 1847,73 millones \nde libras exportadas, lo que signific\u00f3 un incremento del 24% en comparaci\u00f3n a las exportaciones del a\u00f1o anterior .\nAun bajo este escenario la producci\u00f3n camaronera en Ecuador enfrenta constantemente grandes desaf\u00edos patol\u00f3gicos. Es \nas\u00ed que los registros de mortalidades desde maduraci\u00f3n pasando por larvicultura hasta la fase de engorde, mayormente son \ncausadas por bacterias del g\u00e9nero Vibrio, cuyo nivel de impacto est\u00e1 relacionado con las condiciones del agua y del suelo, \nincremento de densidades en el cultivo donde hay limitaciones de infraestructura, as\u00ed como posibles factores ambientales \nque se pueden dar a lo largo del a\u00f1o. Este estr\u00e9s se convierte en un enemigo silencioso de las producciones, por lo que \ncomo herramientas de manejo se han empleado diferentes productos para salud que potencializan y activan el sistema \ninmunol\u00f3gico, permitiendo a los camarones responder ante los posibles detonantes de enfermedades. \nProductos inmunomoduladores como los extractos obtenidos del hongo Ganoderma lucidum , cuenta con m\u00e1s de 200 \nfitonutrientes , de los cuales 150 son poderosos antioxidantes,  metabolitos funcionales como los \u00e1cidos  ganodericos . \n1,3/1,6 beta glucanos, prote\u00edna LZ8, as\u00ed como alcaloides, tripertenoides, ganoderanos, germanio org\u00e1nico polisac\u00e1ridos  con \namplias  propiedades anti f\u00fangicas, antibacterianas y anti inflamatorias, han demostrado tener un efecto en el mejoramiento \nde la capacidad inmuno moduladora, convirti\u00e9ndolo en un profil\u00e1ctico  de inter\u00e9s en la acuacultura.

Un estudio de efectividad \nin vitro, contra cultivos primarios de hemocitos de camar\u00f3n fue desarrollado a diferentes concentraciones del hongo G. \nlucidum desde 0.05 ppm hasta 5 ppm (Fig. 1), donde por medio de la t\u00e9cnica de reducci\u00f3n del nitra blue tetrasolium \n(NBT), se pudo determinar que la producci\u00f3n de ani\u00f3n super\u00f3xido se incrementaba constantemente a medida que se \naumentaba la concentraci\u00f3n del hongo a partir de 0.2 ppm. Los resultados muestran una estimulaci\u00f3n de los hemocitos a \nla concentraci\u00f3n de 0,2 ppm, mostrando tasas de O2- superiores a 1.5, considerada como la base promedio de activaci\u00f3n de \nlos mismos. A esta concentraci\u00f3n de G. lucidum resulto ser del 10% al 20 % menor a las empleadas por otros productos \nimunoestimulantes basados en levadura.\nLa concentraci\u00f3n m\u00ednima inhibitoria letal tambi\u00e9n fue ensayada en cinco cepas bacterianas que son conocidas como \npat\u00f3genas para camarones. Los resultados al t\u00e9rmino de 48h mostraron que una concentraci\u00f3n de1000 ppm fue suficiente \npara inhibir el crecimiento Vibrio parahaemolytcus, Pseudomonas flourescen, Pseudomonas sp. En tanto que se requiri\u00f3 \n3000 ppm para matar al Vibrio vulnificus y Vibrio harveyi .  \nPruebas realizadas in vivo  en larvicultura durante 3 ciclos de cultivo y en cuadruplicado en cada ciclo fue suministrado \nG. lucidum al alimento en una de las raciones de alimentaci\u00f3n diaria 4g/kg y al agua a raz\u00f3n de 5g/TM una sola vez al \nd\u00eda. Al t\u00e9rmino de los ciclos de larvicultura que duraron 18 d\u00edas se observ\u00f3 en promedio un 17% m\u00e1s de supervivencia a \nfavor de los tanques que recibieron G. lucidum junto con un 95% de uniformidad en tallas de las larvas. Mientras que los \ntanques control terminaron con una supervivencia promedio de 73% y una uniformidad de tallas a la cosecha del 83%. \nEstos resultados son consecuencia del mejor estado de salud lo cual fue evidenciado por an\u00e1lisis histopatol\u00f3gicos, donde se \nobserv\u00f3 larvas con menor carga bacteriana y estructuras definidas en sus \u00f3rganos internos (resultados a presentarse). En las \nmaduraciones para contra restar las mortalidades causadas por el transporte se evalu\u00f3 la aplicaci\u00f3n de 20 g /TM de agua. \nLos resultados al final del trasporte desde camaronera hasta los laboratorios de maduraci\u00f3n mostraron una reducci\u00f3n de las \ntasas de mortalidades de 15 % a 1,5 %, demostrando efectividad en la reducci\u00f3n perdida de reproductores, camarones de \ngran importancia para los programas de mejoramiento gen\u00e9tico.\nEn la fase de precria el hongo G. Lucidum fue evaluado en una dosis de 5 g/kg de alimento en piscinas de tierra con una \ndensidad de 4 millones de post larvas por ha, reporto una supervivencia superior al 70%, proporcionando una diferencia \npromedio a favor del producto del 40%, m\u00e1s de supervivencia con respecto a las precrias que no lo emplearon, demostrando \nsu inmunomodulaci\u00f3n y mejora en la salud de los animales. \nEste trabajo demuestra la capacidad inmunomodular el sistema inmune del camar\u00f3n y de inhibir el crecimiento de bacterias \npat\u00f3genas que tiene el hongo G.

The most valuable \npart of SB is berry oil due to high content of carotenoids, \ntocopherols, fatty acids, sterols, omega-3, -6 and -7 fatty \nacids while BA are valuable source of polyphenols, \npigments, lipids, proteins and polysaccharides which \npossess different biological activities such as antioxidant \nand anti-inflammatory etc (Shah et al., 2021; Quit\u00e9rio et \nal., 2021). BA polysaccharides are already used in food \nindustry as gelling, thickening and emulsifying agents. \nHigh content of structurally different BAM in SB oil \nand BA making them an excellent choice for design \nof FFs. However,  carotenoids and  tocopherols present \nin SB oil are potent antioxidants but highly unstable \nand susceptible during processing and storage. The \nencapsulation is an effective approach to prevent their \ndegradation and control release in food products. The \nmost common method for the effective encapsulation \nof BAM is spray drying (SD) but the quality of the final \nproduct considerably depends on proper carrier selection \n(Eun et al. 2019). Therefore, the aim of this study was to \ndetermine  carotenoid and tocopherol content as well as \nantioxidant capacity (AC) in SB oil powders produced \nby SD using different carriers [\u03b2-cyclodextrin (CD) and \ngum arabic (GA)] and oil to carrier ratio (1.2; 1:4) with \naddition of  polysaccharides (0, 15 and 30%) extracted \nfrom BA ( Fucus virsoides ) at drying temperature of 150 \n\u00b0C. Results showed the highest retention of carotenoids \nand tocopherols and AC in powders produced using CD \ncarrier and oil to carrier ratio 1:4 with addition of 30% \nof polysaccharides. The addition of polysaccharides \nsignificantly affected retention of  carotenoids.  \n181\nFRESHWATER PRAWN, Macrobrachium rosenbergii  CULTURE IN QUINTANA ROO, \nMEXICO\nJorge Ignacio Pel\u00e1ez Pier* \nAcuacultura Caribe Sur SPR de RL, Pozo #18 Sergio Butr\u00f3n Casas, Oth\u00f3n P. Blanco Q.R. \nserviciosacuicolasse@hotmail.com \nWorldwide demand for freshwater prawns has been increasing significantly in the last few years. The production of \nfreshwater prawn M. rosenbergii  in M\u00e9xico is close to zero. The main cause is the lack of hatchery post larvae production. \nIn the Indo-Pacific region production commenced based on government supported PL production. In the 70s and 80s the \nMexican government produced PLs that were distributed to growers with little support for production and, thus, little \nsuccess. Or solution was to produce PLs to demonstrate that commercial rearing is a viable business. This will bring \ninvestors into the nascent industry.\nConditions in the State of Quintana Roo for M. rosenbergii culture are ideal in terms of climate, water supply, available \nland, market, connectivity to national and international markets and security . \nWe started a pilot Project of PL production for grow out at our farm. First year production was 600,000 Pls and the hatchery \nis being modified to double production. At present our infrastructure consists of 6 20-m circular HDPE tanks for Pl nursery, \n8 1,800 m2 earthen ponds and 6 1 ha ponds for grow out and process, selection and cool storage rooms (under construction). \nOur personnel is highly skilled with experience in all aspects of production. PL production cycles require 30 days, the \nnursery phase is 2 months and grow out is a 5-6 month process.  \nProduction results are similar to reports from Asia with consistent yields over the last 3 cycles. Production costs are \ndiscussed, representing 50% of sale price for a market that is, currently, being supplied from imports. The main product for \nnational and international markets is frozen with prawns of around 80 grams. \nProduction of freshwater prawns in Quintana Roo represent a significant opportunity to develop a sustainable, socially \nresponsible and economically viable business. 182\nA V ANCES EN EL CULTIVO DE LANGOSTINO MALAYO Macrobrachium rosenbergii EN \nQUINTANA ROO MEXICO\nJorge Ignacio Pel\u00e1ez Pier * Jos\u00e9 Rafael Reyes Campos, Erika Lolany Camacho Chuy, Marily Cruz Ram\u00edrez\nAcuacultura Caribe Sur SPR de RL, Pozo #18 Sergio Butron Casas, Oth\u00f3n P.

A \nrecurring problem that hinders the presence of new technologies in the market is to reach agreements that align the interests \nof technology developers with those of producers. In the case of aquaculture, an added difficulty arises in evaluating new \ntechnologies, since working with living organisms implies non-linearity of the productive factors. This study describes and \nshows the application of two complementary bioeconomic indicators, which allow facilitating negotiation and reducing \ntechnology transfer risks. The indicators proposed are \u201c minimum coverage \u201d \u2013 defined as the minimum values   of one or \nmore factors that constitute the production function, justifying investment in a technology and \u201c maximum price \u201d \u2013   defined \nas the maximum value that a new technology can reach in a way that justifies the investment made by the buyer (Figure 1). \nThese metrics are exemplified by their assessment in a hypothetical case study applied to the use of genetic improvement \nprograms in salmon production. \nThe application of contracts with pre-established guarantees is a significant argument for trust generation, which is \nespecially relevant when dealing with new technologies associated with a significant investment since in this manner the \nrisk is shared. The concepts developed in this study are aimed at obtaining analytical values   that allow maximizing trust \nbetween parties, facilitating the development and transfer of new technologies, which has a crucial role to play in achieving \nsustainable aquaculture growth.\n186\nIS THERE ONLY ONE SPECIES OF Hepatozoon  INFECTING BRAZILIAN CAIMANS? \nMOLECULAR ANALYSIS BRINGS NEW INSIGHTS INTO HAEMOGREGARINE \nDIVERSITY\nLet\u00edcia Pereira \u00dangari*, Edward Charles Netherlands, Andr\u00e9 Luiz Quagliatto Santos, Edna Paulino de Alcantara, \nReinaldo Jos\u00e9 da Silva and Lucia Helena O\u00b4Dwyer\nSetor de Parasitologia, DBBVPZ, Instituto de Bioci\u00eancias, UNESP, Distrito de Rubi\u00e3o Junior\nBotucatu (SP) Brasil\nletspungari@hotmail.com\nThe population of Brazilian caimans is considered the largest in the world. Brazil is the second-largest exporter of fur and \nBrazilian alligator farming is a potential aquaculture production in agribusiness and an alternative to reduce the disorderly \nand illegal extraction of these wild animals. Therefore, a strict sanitary scheme is necessary for the breeding sites to avoid \nthe spread of diseases. Among the infections that affect these animals, Brazilian caimans are hosts of a great   number of  \nparasites, including hemoparasites.\nIn 2018-2020, eleven Caiman crocodilus  from Mato Grosso State were collected and screened for haemogregarine \nparasites. Through morphological analysis, a species of the genus Hepatozoon  (Adeleorina: Hepatozoidae) was identified \nwith free gamonts [Fig.1a], gamonts with cytoplasmic vacuoles [Fig.1b] and mature gamonts [Fig.1c] in the blood smears, \nand meronts with merozoites [Fig.1d-f] in the liver of these animals. \nThe eleven isolates amplified targeting the 18S gene have shown 100% similarity among them, and 98.4% - 98.8% \nin comparison with other isolates of Hepatozoon caimani , the only species known to infect Brazilian caimans so far. \nComplementary to this, the phylogeny revealed a main clade of isolates from Brazilian caimans, divided into two subclades, \none of this study and the other with Hepatozoon caimani  isolates only [Fig. 2]. This result brings new insights on Hepatozon \ndiversity infecting the caimans, with a possible new species reported in this study and generates important information for \ndiseases in alligator farming in Brazil.\n187\nFORO DE INVERSI\u00d3N Y FINANCIAMIENTO EN ACUICULTURA\nSesi\u00f3n Especial del Congreso Mundial de Acuacultura WA2021\nWorld Aquaculture Society (WAS)\nCiudad de M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, 24 a 27 de mayo de 2022\nGenetic characterization of aquaculture populations\nRicardo Perez-Enriquez\nCentro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste, S.C.

The genetic characterization is fundamental for crossbreeding strategies design within a genetic nucleus \nfor its long-term maintenance and to support the obtaining of improved genetic lines either for growth, pathogen resistance \nor reproductive capacity, among other commercial important traits. This characterization consist in the genetic profiling of \nthe breeding stocks to estimate, among other parameters, the levels of genetic diversity, inbreeding, kinship, and genetic \ndifferentiation among stocks. \nAt the laboratory of Aquaculture Genetics at CIBNOR, we offer an innovative scientific-based service for the genetic \ncharacterization of breeding stocks supported by the use of low-cost genotyping platforms that can be affordable for \nmedium to low-sized producers. This service goes from sample collection to genetic data analysis, which is delivered to the \nhatchery owners and technicians by a technical report thoroughly explained in a dedicated workshop.\nFor the short-term future, we are also developing new genotyping strategies as well as implementing more sophisticated \ntools to include genomic data. All these with the goal of promoting a more productive and sustainable Mexican aquaculture.\n188\nA TECHNOLOGY FOR THE CULTURE OF AMBERJACK, Seriola rivoliana , IN MEXICO\nJuan Carlos P\u00e9rez-Urbiola*\nCentro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste, S.C. \nAv.

Fisheries is more and more unsustainable \nand aquaculture will need to take a major role in providing nourishment if we want to contribute to improve human health \nin the years to come. Aquaculture has been growing steadily over the years and provides more than 50% of seafood for \nhuman consumption. \nThe amberjack, Seriola rivoliana , is considered an excellent candidate for sustainable aquaculture because is highly \nadaptable to captivity and intensification, breeds routinely, readily consumes extruded balanced rations, has fast growth \nrates to commercial size (2-3 kg in 18 months) and is well received in the market at prices that range from US$10 to 20/\nkg.  The Northwest Biological Research Center has developed a relevant knowledge base for processes like broodstock \ncapture, transport and maintenance, reproduction, larval culture, nursery rearing and grow out, while understanding \ndisease interactions and the efficient use of feeds. In association with commercial producers, an innovative technology \nfor the culture of the species has been developed to competitively enter the market. Information on initial investment for \ninfrastructure, working capital, income and financials (IRR, NPV , B/C) is discussed.189\nPRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF SHRIMP FARMING IN ECUADOR AND WAY \nFORWARD\nYahira Piedrahita\nNational Chamber of Aquaculture\nCentro Empresarial Las C\u00e1maras, Torre B oficina 301\nGuayaquil EC090101\nypiedrahita@cna-ecuador.com \nEcuadorian shrimp industry has experienced sustained growth over the last 20 years (Fig. 1). In 2021, shrimp exports \nexceeded 840,000 MT (a growth of 25% compared to 2020), positioning the country among the world\u2019s leading producers \nof Penaeus vannamei , the main supplier of shrimp to China and the European Union and one of the major suppliers to the \nUnited States. It is estimated that by 2027 Ecuador will double current production, reaching 2 million MT  of shrimp.\nDespite this notable and sustained increase, Ecuador\u2019s shrimp production model differs significantly from that used by its \nmain competitors. To get out of the white spot crisis, which reduced production by 70% between 1998 and 2000, Ecuador \nopted to use selected breeders from among the survivors of ponds affected by white spot. At first using the mass selection \nmethod (choosing the largest survivors) and currently with breeding programs that use the most modern tools for this \npurpose.\nWhile shrimp farming has experienced sustained growth, driven primarily by growth in global demand for seafood, it is no \nless true that much of this growth is attributed to the new and best practices that the entire Ecuadorian shrimp production \nchain has developed and implemented in recent years.\nThis presentation explores the evolution of the Ecuadorian shrimp industry since its first stages, the main changes \nexperienced over time, as well as the challenges they have had to face and the plans for the immediate future.\n190\nRESULTS OF A COMMERCIAL V ACCINATION PROGRAM BY INJECTION USING AN \nAUTOGENOUS V ACCINE FOR  Streptococcus agalactiae BIOTYPE 1a IN A TILAPIA CAGE \nFARM OPERATION IN HAITI\nAndres Piedrahita\nTaino Aqua Ferme S.A.\nLa Source # 2, Fond Parisien\nHaiti\nandrespw04@hotmail.com\nTaino Aqua Ferme SA is a private company located in Lac Azuei, Fond Parisien Haiti.  The company was founded in 2015 \nand produces whole fresh tilapia for the local Haitian market, currently producing 300 metric tons per annum.  Tilapia are \nraised in 15-meter diameter HDPE cages inside Lac Azuei, an inland saline lake (10 ppt salinity) close to the border with \nthe Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola.\nSince the beginning of grow-out operations, mortality caused by Streptococcus led to low recoveries (51% on average).  \nAn approach of formulating an autogenous vaccine against this pathogen was implemented in November of 2020.  To date, \nseventeen cages have undergone a full production cycle after having been vaccinated by injection at 30 grams ABW.\nResults comparing these vaccinated cages vs control cages demonstrate an improvement of 12.5 % cumulative mortality \nthroughout the cage farming growth cycle.  Prior to implementation of the vaccination program, three day fasting periods \nand treatments using antibiotics approved for tilapia farming, were strategies used to mitigate acute mortality spikes.  The \nprogram, which assures all the population in the farm is vaccinated, has led to a minimizing both fasting and medication, \nshortening culture cycle and dependency on antibiotic use.191\nDECOUPLED FLOCPONICS SYSTEMS AS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO REDUCE \nTHE PROTEIN LEVEL OF TILAPIA JUVENILES\u2019 DIET IN INTEGRATED AGRI-\nAQUACULTURE PRODUCTION\nSara M Pinho*, J\u00e9ssica P de Lima, Luiz H David, Magdiel S Oliveira, Simon Goddek, Dalton J Carneiro, Karel J \nKeesman, and Maria C\u00e9lia Portella\nMathematical and Statistical Methods (Biometris), Wageningen University, P.O.

Enabling the use of less protein in the fish diets is one of the benefits of BFT. The effect of the reduction \nof protein content, and consequently the input of nitrogen, on fish and plant production in DFP systems has not yet been \ninvestigated. This study was designed to investigate and evaluate the production of lettuce and tilapia juveniles in a DFP \nsystem using different levels of crude protein (CP) in the fish diets. \nThe zootechnical performance of tilapia juveniles and lettuce \ngrowth in the DFP system were evaluated, using different \ndiets containing 24, 28, 32, and 36% CP. Fish production \nin DFP systems was compared to those reared in traditional \ndecoupled aquaponics systems (DAPS) and in biofloc-based \nsystems (BFT), both fed with 32% CP diet. The experimental \nperiod of tilapia juvenile production lasted 56 days.  Lettuce \nproduction in two cycles was also performed in DFP systems \nwith different CP levels and their growth was compared \nto those in DAPS and hydroponics systems, as control \ntreatments. In Cycle 1 , the seedling phase was evaluated in \na 14-day trial. In Cycle 2 , the final production phase was \nperformed for 21 days until harvest. High mortality of fish \noccurred in DFP-36 in the middle of the experiment, thus this \ntreatment was discontinued.\n \nThe results showed that tilapia reared in DFP and fed with \n24 and 28% CP grew similarly to those in DAPS fed with \n32% CP diet. Fish in DFP-32 and BFT-32 grew similarly and \nabove the other treatments. Additionally, plant growth results \nshowed no differences in both cycles among all treatments. \nThe results obtained in this study indicate that using less\nCP in fish diets to produce lettuce and tilapia juveniles is technically possible and feasible in a decoupled FLOCponics \nsystem. \nFunding : FAPESP (grants 2017/50431-9 and 2018/13235-0), NWO (grant 438-17-402), Belmont Forum (grant 726744), \nand CNPq (grant 311108/2017).\n192\nPARENTAL THERMAL STRESS AFFECTS THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION OF THE \nNEXT GENERATION OF JUVENILE Octopus maya\nAlejandra Plata-D\u00edaz*, Claudia Caamal-Monsreal,  Jorge Arturo Vargas-Ab\u00fandez,  Maite Mascar\u00f3,  \nGabriela Rodr\u00edguez-Fuentes,  Carlos Rosas, Fernando D\u00edaz\nUNAM Posgrado de Ciencias del Mar y Limnolog\u00eda, Puerto de Abrigo S/N, UNAM, 97355 Sisal, \nYucat\u00e1n  \nE-mail: ale.plata.diaz92@gmail.com\nThere are records that Octopus maya  adults could experience extreme temperatures during reproductive maturation. So \nfar, there is no data to indicate what kind of consequences an offspring produced by thermally stressed parents might \nexperience. The present study was dedicated to evaluating the effect of thermal stress in female O. maya  at the end of their \nreproductive season on aerobic performance (AS) and antioxidant defense mechanisms (ADM) of juveniles exposed to \nextreme temperatures. For this, two groups of wild females were managed, some acclimated to 24\u00b0C and others to 30\u00b0C \nuntil spawning, and the juveniles of each group of females were divided into two groups, the first group exposed to 25\u00b0C \nand the other group at 30\u00b0C.\nIn the evaluation of the respiratory metabolism (Oxygen consumption in routine, as well as in the metabolic rate induced by \nthe maximum temperature), it was observed that the juveniles from stressed females had higher metabolic rates than those \nobserved from non-stressed females, mainly in animals at 30\u00b0C, suggesting a transgenerational effect of temperature on the \nenergetic physiology of this animal (Fig. 1).\nAerobic scope was evaluated every 5 days until day 20 along with ADM and two indicators of oxidative damage (OD). The \nresults obtained indicate that juveniles from thermally stressed females had limited physiological capacities to compensate \nfor OD, being very sensitive to 30\u00b0C. In contrast, juveniles from non-thermally stressed females showed an ADM that, at \nleast for a time, was able to eliminate the OD. These results are discussed in light of the possible consequences of warming \nbetween generations and its relationship with the time of exposure to high temperatures (Fig. 2).\n193\nPROSPECTIVE OF PANGASIUS PRODUCTION IN SOUTHWEST MEXICO \nDiego Platas-Rosado*, Luis G\u00f3zales Reynoso, Abimael Lagunes, Fabiola Beltr\u00e1n Leyva.\nDiego Esteban Platas Rosado\ndplatas@colpos.mx\nPangasius Aquaculture in Mexico is an activity that can be strategically promoted to create jobs and food security for low-\nincome families in states with potential; especially in cases that present problems of malnutrition and socioeconomic lags. \nThis is strategic to fight against hunger and, due to the demand for inputs, it stimulates the internal market, therefore, it \nhas a great social impact, due to its wide range of technologies and systems from backyard family units to highly technical \nand intensive commercials farms. Pangasius Aquaculture is profitable and a good rural business under certain conditions. \nMexico, due to its physical, natural and social characteristics, as well as its geographical position has all necessary and \nsufficient conditions to have a world leadership in this sector.

Also, by having an important value for the Portuguese and \nSpanish canning industry, sardines from the fisheries are traditionally absorbed by this sector. Besides, the stock of sardine \npopulations in the Mediterranean Sea reached very low levels that lead to a strict stock management, which raised questions \non the viability of the production of the species in captivity. At the Aquaculture Research Station of Olh\u00e3o (EPPO), an \naquaculture facility from the Portuguese Institute from the Ocean and Atmosphere (IPMA), which has the capacity for the \nconduction of trials at a pre-industrial scale, it was possible to successful adapt three lots of wild sardine\u2019s breeders which \nare currently on the third year of natural spawns.\nThe zootechnical parameters of the different stages of sardine culture in captivity (e.g. broodstock management, larval \nrearing and juvenile fattening) have been studied in order to obtain the maximum information on the aquaculture production \nof this species. Fish adapted well to captivity and presented a continuous and voracious feeding behavior. The comparison \nwith wild individuals showed a higher content of lipids in the muscle in captive fish with adequate and not significantly \ndifferent levels of EPA and DHA.\nAs nutrition is an extremely important factor for the success and quality of broodstock eggs, larvae and juvenile growth, \nnutrition trials have been carried out to assess the appropriate levels of protein in diets which was shown to be situated \naround 35% with higher values of protein in the diet favoring gonad maturation.  \nThe results on sardine\u2019s production led us to consider that sardine\u2019s production in aquaculture might be promising in a \nnear future, to ensure the demand for the fresh fish market and mainly to guarantee a constant supply for the canning \nindustry. In order to establish an optimal nutritional protocol for sardine production, further and more detailed studies using \nmetabolomics and molecular biology approaches are being conducted.  \nThis study had the support of the project DIVERSIAQUA II (Mar2020-P02M01-0656P)195\nAQUACULTURE RESEARCH STATION OF OLH\u00c3O: FACILITIES AND RESEARCH \nLINES \nC\u00e1tia L.

Since aquaponics is a globally growing aquaculture technology, studies that evaluate \nthe performance of tambaqui in aquaponics systems are needed. Growth models are an option to formally describe fish \ngrowth and consequently culture performance all along the culture period. These models serve also as a tool to make \nmanagerial decisions. A 34-day trial culture of tambaqui and lettuce in permanently coupled aquaponic systems was carried \nout during the summer in Brazil. The research facility comprises 16 experimental aquaponic units, each one containing one \nfish tank (0.38m-3), 3 plant beds (0.42 m2 of surface and volume of 60 L each), and filtering systems.  Four fish stocking \nrates (50, 100, 150 and 200 fish m-3) were combined with four feeding rates. The base feeding rate (E) was adapted from the \nrecommended by the Brazilian Agriculture Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) and a value of 1.5% was added (E+1.5%) \nor the values of 1.5 or 3% were subtracted (E-1.5%, E-3% respectively) to stablish the other feed rates, totaling sixteen \ncombinations. Fish with initial average weight of 16.88 g were introduced in the systems according to the corresponding \nstocking rate and at least 10% of the fish of each system were weighted weekly to adjust the feeding rates. With the weight \n(g) data, and after outlier elimination, the V on Bertalanffy, Champan-Richards, Gompertz, monomolecular and logistic \ngrowth models were tested. The model that best adjusted to tambaqui growth in the aquaponics systems cultured with \nlettuce was the logistic one, , were W is the weight in the respective culture day ( t), and  ,,  the growth model parameters \n(Table 2).  The models were validated through the Theil index which was minor than 0.2 in each case. \nThese growth models may be used to compare the tambaqui performance in aquaponics in other seasons or with other \nproduction technologies. Likewise, it may be useful as input for analysis of stocking and feeding rate optimization, \nbioeconomic analysis or system modelling. \nFinancial support: FAPESP (2018/23658-5,  2018/23605-9, 2017/50431-9), CNPq (311108/2017-2).  \n197\nANTIOXIDANT ENZYME ACTIVITIES OF WHITE SHRIMP Penaeus vannamei  UNDER \nCOMPENSATORY GROWTH AND ABIOTIC STRESS\nPy C.1*, Elizondo Gonz\u00e1lez R.1, Pe\u00f1a-Rodr\u00edguez A.1\n1*Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste, S.C.

Expansion of aquaculture industry requires the implementation of strategies to \nreduce production costs. Among these, feed restriction is gaining interest due to the unusual acceleration of growth after \na feed deprivation period, known as compensatory growth. While compensatory growth may allow reaching the weight \nof organisms never subjected to dietary restriction, the associated physiological costs are poorly studied, particularly in \ncrustaceans.\nA 52-day trial was conducted on juvenile P . vannamei (0.5 \u00b1 0.02 g avg. wt.) , exposed to three different dietary regimes: \nthree cycles of 3 days of feed restriction and 3 of feed ad libitum  (T3:3), four cycles of 3 days of feed restriction and 9 \nof feed ad libitum  (T3:9), and an unrestricted treatment as control. Each treatment consisted of 3 replicates of 95 shrimp \nin 600-L tanks. Following the cyclic feed restrictions, all shrimp \nwere fed ad libitum . Intensity of feed restriction was calculated to \nallow a 20% saving of feed over the experimental period for both \nrestricted treatments. On day 35 (during compensatory response), \nhepatopancreas and muscle samples were collected. On the same \nday, 16 shrimp from each replicate were extracted and subjected \nto two abiotic challenges. Eight shrimp were subjected to 24-hour \nhyperthermia (32\u00b0C). The other 8 shrimp were subjected to an \nincrease in ammonium concentration for 24 hours (40 mg L-1). At the \nend of the abiotic challenges, hepatopancreas and muscle samples \nwere collected. \nAfter feeding restriction periods, T3:3 and T3:9, shrimp exhibited \na lower weight than control organisms. On the final day, T3:3 \nreached a weight not significantly different from the control, \nshowing full compensatory growth. T3:9 organisms were unable to \nreach the weight of the control organisms, however, they exhibited \na significantly higher specific growth rate than the control during \nrefeeding, indicating partial compensatory growth (Figure 1).  \nAt day 35, shrimp under compensatory growth showed lower \nhepatopancreas superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity than the control. \nOrganisms\u2019 survival during the abiotic challenges was not affected \nby the different treatments. After the abiotic challenge, shrimp in \ncompensatory growth showed a significantly lower hepatopancreas \nSOD activity than the control (Figure 2). Compensatory growth was \nrelated to altered antioxidant activity in P .vannamei , however, lipid \nperoxidation, the main consequence of oxidative stress, was not \nsignificantly affected between treatments.\n198\nIDENTIFICA\u00c7\u00c3O DE INDIV\u00cdDUOS DE PIRAPITINGA ( Piaractus brachypomus ) SEM \nESPINHAS INTRAMUSCULARES (SEIM) NA REGI\u00c3O SUDESTE DA COL\u00d4MBIA\nAna Mar\u00eda Carolina Quintero Pardo*, Henry Omar Meneses Mart\u00ednez, Jhoan Jair David Valle, \nLuis Gabriel Quintero Pinto, Dagoberto Mart\u00ednez Gonz\u00e1lez\nFaculdade de Ci\u00eancias Agr\u00e1rias e Veterin\u00e1rias, Universidade Estadual Paulista,\nVia de Acesso Prof. Paulo Donato Castellane s/n, CEP: 14884-900 Jaboticabal \u2013 SP - Brasil\nE-mail: ana.pardo@unesp.br\nA pirapitinga ( Piaractus brachypomus ), origin\u00e1ria da bacia do rio Amazonas, \u00e9 considerada a principal esp\u00e9cie pisc\u00edcola \nnativa produzida na Col\u00f4mbia.

The mean bodyweight of the fish was 4.72g. Leachate of cigarette butts was prepared by soaked 24 smoked \n(4.21g) and unsmoked (4.82g) cigarette butts in six litres of water for 24 hours. The leachate was serially diluted to obtain \nconcentration of 8 cigarette butts per litre (8CB/L), (6CB/L), (4CB/L), (2CB/L), (1CB/L), (0.5CB/L), (0.25CB/L) and \n(0CB/L). Two hundred and forty (240) C. gariepinus  of 21 days old were randomly exposed to the 8 different concentrations \nwith ten fishes per treatment and replicated 3 times.  T1 was exposed to 0CB/L, T2 (0.25CB/L), T3 (0.5CB/L), T4 (1CB/L), \nT5 (2CB/L), T6 (4CB/L), T7 (6CB/L) and T8 (8CB/L).  The experiment was carried out for 96 hours. The result shows \nthat the mortality of C. gariepinus  increased with an increase in concentrations of the cigarette butts and time of exposure. \nTable 1 shows that there was 100% mortality in T8, T7 and 36.7, 33.3, 16.7, 13.3, and 6.7% mortality was observed in \nT6, T5, T4, T3, and T2 respectively after 96 hours of exposure  while there was no mortality in the control treatment (T1). \nTable 2 shows the results of LC50 and LC95.  LC50 value of 0.57 and LC95 value of 2.30 were obtained after 96 hours of \nexposure. The result of the physico-chemical water quality shows that there was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the \nmean temperature, dissolved oxygen and salinity of the leachate but there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in the mean \npH among the treatments. This study shows that cigarette butts leachate is toxic to freshwater fish.\n200\nTILAPIA PRODUCTION IN BIOFLOC SYSTEM\nFarhad Rajabipour*, Nassrin Mashaii \nNational Research Center of Saline Water Aquatics, Iranian Fisheries Research Science Institue, Agricultural \nResearch, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Bafq, Yazd, Iran\nIntensive culture of Tilapia has developed globally in different systems. The biofloc method is one of the effective responses \nto the environmental and nutritional issues in aquaculture industry. The system consists of a liner ponds enclosed with \nenclosed space to prevent evaporation and maintain water temperature and prevent temperature shocks with the central \ndrainage. Aeration causes the flow of water and the discharge of the sewage from the center. Tilapia production in biofloc \nsystem has been activated in the desert central region of Iran and has led to the intensive tilapia production in indoor \nsystem, recently.\nTilapia was the secound fish cultured in the world during the last decade and it has the first stage of fish culture, now. Due \nto the special characteristics of this fish, including high adaptability and high resistance, its culture has development in \nvarious systems. The development of Tilapia breeding around the world, along with the lack of freshwater for agricultural \nand urban use, has gradually fueled tilapia from semi-intensive to intensive systems.\nDespite the limitation of agriculture and aquaculture activities in the deserted areas due to limited agricultural soil and \nwater resources, technology can response for the proper exploitation of these are sources for food and protein production. \nIntensive culture of Tilapia has developed globally in pools, tanks, raceways, cage, return and aquaponic systems. Water \nquality and nutrition management are the most important factors for success of intensive tilapia culture.\nTilapia is a filter feeder fish, so, fertility of pond has an important role in the culture. The biofloc method is one of the \neffective responses to the environmental and nutritional issues in aquaculture industry (Zhang & Luo, 2014). Biofloc \ntechnology is the use of a microbial community to produce a high-protein supplementary microbial source that is used \nby the filter feeder species. Aeration and proper mixing lead to water quality control. The microbial community, which \nis mainly heterotrophic bacteria in water, acts as a biofilter. The function of these bacteria accelerates the absorption of \nnitrogen and reduces ammonia levels and is more efficient than the nitrification process. Increasing hydrocarbons leads to \nfixing N and non-organic C producing proteins (Azim & Little, 2008; Day, 2015; Avnimelech 2012 & 2007).\nIn the biofloc systems water change is very low, the amount of feed consumed in these systems is minimized, the nutrient \nexcreted from the breeding system is significantly reduced and nutrients are recycled regularly. Besides, using brackish \nwater in the system leads to intensive tilapia culture.\nOur implanted system consists of a liner ponds enclosed with enclosed space to prevent evaporation and maintain water \ntemperature and prevent temperature shocks with the central drainage. Aeration causes the flow of water and the discharge \nof the sewage from the center.\nTilapia production in biofloc system is used in some parts of the world. In Iran, it has been activated in the desert central \nregion of Iran and has led to the intensive tilapia production in indoor system, recently .201\nMAKING OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE VIABLE: ADV ANCEMENTS IN SUBMERSIBLE \nNET PENS\nFelipe Ramirez*\nInnovasea\n266 Summer St.\nBoston, MA 02210\nframirez@innovasea.com\nInterest in submersible or more rugged \u201coffshore\u201d (open ocean, high energy) pens has been increasing for the past several \nyears because of the many benefits they bring to operator and the expansion potential they bring to the industry.

Reid\nCentre for Marine Applied Research\n27 Parker street, COVE\nDartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada\nB2Y 4T5\ngreid@perennia.ca\nClimate change threatens our ability to ensure global food security, eradicate poverty, and achieve sustainable \ndevelopment. Aquaculture is well positioned to help meet the world\u2019s future seafood needs, but heavy reliance of most \nglobal aquaculture on the ambient environment and ecosystem services suggests inherent vulnerability to climate change \neffects. While mitigation of climate change is essential, it remains elusive. Adaptation then becomes the only pragmatic \noption. Reconciling climate change and aquaculture to support adaptation is a huge challenge as decision making typically \nneeds to consider large amounts of information encompassing multiple disciplines. This results in increasing demands for \naddressing knowledge gaps and facilitating research. Climate change vulnerability assessments is one method that triages \nthreats needed to prioritize adaptation efforts. This approach has recently begun to see application in aquaculture. This \npresentation explores potential roles for climate change vulnerability assessments and the evolving needs of climate change \nand aquaculture research, which is crucial to support planned adaptation.205\nALGINATE-BASED BEADS: ENCAPSULATION OF SAGE ESSENTIAL OIL BY \nELECTROSTATIC EXTRUSION \nMaja Repaji\u0107*, Sandra Balbino, Erika Dobroslavi\u0107, Daniela Cvitkovi\u0107, Ena Cegledi, Branka Levaj, and Verica \nDragovi\u0107-Uzelac\nUniversity of Zagreb Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology\nPierottijeva 6, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia\nmaja.repajic@pbf.unizg.hr\nRecently, various techniques have been developed for encapsulating bioactive compounds to convert them into a more \nstable form. One of them is electrostatic extrusion, which is highly recommended for hydrophobic bioactive compounds \nsuch as essential oils (EOs). Among the various polymers, alginate is most commonly used as a core material. This is a \nnaturally occurring polysaccharide found in brown algae and is characterized by high viscosity, gelling properties, high \nstability, low cost and non-toxicity. Sage ( Salvia officinalis  L.) is a perennial aromatic and medicinal plant of the Lamiaceae \nfamily. In addition to various phytochemicals, it also contains EOs which are found to have antioxidant, antimicrobial, \nantifungal, insecticidal and antiproliferative properties. Therefore, this study investigated the development of alginate-\nbased beads containing sage EO prepared by electrostatic extrusion.\nFor the preparation of beads, the content of alginate (0.5, 1 and 1.5%, w/v) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) (3 and 5%, w/v) \nwas varied. Alginic acid sodium salt (low viscosity), previously dissolved in distilled water, sage EO (5%, w/v) and Tween \n20 (0.5%, w/v) were homogenized at 10 000 rpm for 4 min. Beads were prepared with B\u00fcchi encapsulator B-390 (Flawil \nSwitzerland) using a 1 mm stainless steel needle at a frequency of 80 Hz, a pressure of 1000 mbar, an amplitude of 6 and \nan electrostatic potential of 500 V . After collection in CaCl2 solution, the beads were washed in distilled water, drained and \nused for further analysis. Encapsulation yield (%) was expressed as the ratio between the amount of beads obtained and the \namount of emulsion used for the encapsulation. The size of the beads was measured using a micrometer screw gauge and \nthe average dmax, dmin and sphericity factor (SF) were calculated. \nAll analyzed parameters were significantly affected by alginate and CaCl2 content, except for SF (Table 1). The highest \nencapsulation yield and bead size were obtained at the highest concentrations of alginate and CaCl2. In addition, the beads \ngenerally maintained their roundness. Although not significant, most spherical beads were produced with 1.5% alginate, \nwhile a lower CaCl2 content resulted in slightly elongated shape of the beads.\n206\nBUSINESS MODEL FOR THE MALASIAN PROWN Macrobrachium rosenbergii \nPOSTLARV AE PRODUCTION  IN SOTA VENTO, VERACRUZ, MEXICO\n \nJuan Lorenzo Reta-Mendiola* Paula Arminda Gonz\u00e1lez-Alfonso, Ver\u00f3nica Lango-Reynoso, \nPonciano P\u00e9rez-Hern\u00e1ndez  \nTropical Agroecosystems Postgrad Program\nColegio de Postgraduados, Campus Veracruz\nTepetates, Veracruz, M\u00e9xico\njretam@colpos.mx  \nIn Sotavento and Grandes monta\u00f1as regions of Veracruz, Mexico, the production of Malayan prawn M. rosenbergii  has \ndecreased due to the closure of the postlarvae production units, which has resulted in the loss of productivity, importation \nof the product and the increase in prices in local markets. \nThe recovery of the production chain lies in the supply of postlarvae, so the objective of this work is to determine an \noptimal business model to activate innovation in the production of Malaysian shrimp postlarvae. \nThe methodology used includes the identification of factors that have influenced the decrease in postlarvae production, the \nidentification of the characteristics of the economic agent for optimal performance, the development of a business model.\nAs outstanding results, it was found that the causes of the decline in production are related to ineffective innovation \nprograms, territorial lag, arbitrary financial support, low economic movement, low knowledge of how to operate production \nsystems.\nA proposal of the economic agent and a business model including productive technology and its respective financial \nanalysis are presented.207\nAQUACULTURE AND FISHERIES FINANCE IN MEXICO.

Therefore, new strategies that improve biosafety protocols are necessary today, to ensure an adequate control of \ndiseases that limit shrimp production. The implementation of non-antibiotic agents, such as probiotics, has emerged as a \npromising strategy to enhance shrimp farming.\nThe evaluation of its controlled and targeted release within \na simulated shrimp digestive tract (DT). The encapsulation \nprocess was carried out using the ionic gelation technique. \nBoth free and bacteria-loaded AMPs were physicochemically \ncharacterized by size, morphology, surface electrical charge, \nthe survival, and the number of encapsulated bacteria after \nthe encapsulation process, and the bacterial survival after \n40-days of storage (at 4 \u25e6C and 25 \u25e6C). The in vitro release \nand survival studies of the bacteria were carried out using \na protocol developed in our laboratory by implementing \nbuffers of dissected organs from shrimp\u2019s DT.\nResults indicated that microparticles with an average size \nof 172\u2013185 \u03bcm and negatively charged (- 16.77 and - 17.66 \nmV , respectively) were obtained after using the ionic gelation \nmethod (Fig. 1). The bacterial survival and encapsulation \nefficiency showed high cell viability and yield above 99%. \nStability studies showed that the best storage temperature \nwas 4 \u25e6C, in which it remained almost 100% of the bacteria \nviable for 15 days; however, cell viability declined to 55% \nsurvival after 30 days of storage at this temperature.\nRegardless of the cell viability reduction after 30 days, there \nare enough viable bacteria cells to be considered as a probiotic \nproduct. Release and survival studies showed that alginate \nparticles had a protective effect on bacteria by keeping ca. \n51.29% of viable probiotic within the shrimp intestine; in \ncontrast, free bacteria only reached the shrimp intestine ca. \n27.16% viable (Fig. 2).\nOur results suggest that microparticles can be produced by a \nlow-cost method that could ultimately benefit shrimp farming \nin a near future.\n209\nSPATIAL PLANNING FORECASTS OPPORTUNITY FOR OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE\nKenneth L. Riley*, Jonathan A. Jossart, Alyssa Randall Taylor, Gretchen E. Bath\nNational Centers for Coastal Ocean Science\nNOAA National Ocean Service\nBeaufort, North Carolina 28516\nKen.Riley@noaa.gov\nThe planning and siting of Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOA) in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the Southern California \nBight is the first ever application of marine spatial planning in U.S. waters for the development of offshore aquaculture at \nthis scale. The results of these analyses provide compelling evidence for the opportunities as well as challenges of siting \noffshore aquaculture in the coastal ocean within a reasonable range of the working waterfront.\nGeospatial analysis for identification of AOA options was based on a categorical framework to ensure relevant, \ncomprehensive data acquisition and characterization for spatial suitability modeling. An authoritative spatial data inventory \nwas developed that included data layers relevant to administrative boundaries, national security (i.e., military), navigation \nand transportation, energy and industry infrastructure, commercial and recreational fishing, natural and cultural resources, \nand oceanography. With over 200 data layers included in each analysis, the maps, models, and descriptions provide the \nmost comprehensive marine spatial modeling in the U.S. federal waters to date. Our methods and models can be used \nto significantly improve the next generation of marine spatial planning, contributing support far beyond aquaculture \ndevelopment by unleashing the power of spatial analytics for offshore energy exploration, shipping and navigation, national \nsecurity and military strategy, identification of marine protected areas, and burgeoning sectors of the ocean economy.210\nPAR\u00c1METROS GEN\u00c9TICOS PARA PESO CORPORAL Y RESISTENCIA AL S\u00cdDROME \nDE MANCHA BLANCA EN CAMAR\u00d3N BLANCO DEL PAC\u00cdFICO UTILIZANDO \nINFORMACI\u00d3N GEN\u00d3MICA\nPsique V .

Se incluy\u00f3 la informaci\u00f3n del genotipo de los 429 progenitores \nde ambas generaciones. Los genotipos fueron obtenidos con el panel AquaArray HD (50  K) vannamei \u00ae (Neogen \u00ae), que \ncontiene 50,811 SNPs. En el control de calidad se us\u00f3 una tasa de llamado para SNP de 80%, frecuencia de alelo mayor \nmenor a 0.01 y equilibrio de Hardy-Weinberg con p-value < 1x 10-6. Quedando 35,258 SNPs y 3,000 individuos. Para la \nestimaci\u00f3n de heredabilidad de P120 d\u00edas y sSMB y la correlaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica entre ellas, se usaron don enfoques:  Un modelo \nanimal tradicional (BLUP) y otro incluyendo la matriz de informaci\u00f3n gen\u00f3mica (ssGBLUP). En ambos se consideraron \ncomo efectos fijos para la sSMB la tina de prueba y el peso al registro, mientras que para P120 el sexo y la edad, adem\u00e1s \ndel efecto com\u00fan de familia. Se utiliz\u00f3 el programa AIREMLF90.\nComo se observa en el Cuadro 1, con el enfoque de ssGBLUP las estimaciones de heredabilidad se reducen los errores \nest\u00e1ndar en ambas caracter\u00edsticas, lo que mejora su precisi\u00f3n. En la rG fue consistentemente negativa y no significativa en \nambos modelos, como se ha observado en otros estudios entre peso corporal e indicadores de resistencia a SMB. \n211\nPAR\u00c1METROS GEN\u00c9TICOS DE CARACTER\u00cdSTICAS MORFOM\u00c9TRICAS ASOCIADAS \nA LA BELLEZA DEL BARBO SUMATRANO (Puntius tetrazona)\nPsique V .

Well-\nmanaged development and growth of tropical seaweed aquaculture in the region may help to assuage these issues while \nalso providing a new source of seaweed biomass for the existing carrageenan, new food and textile and possibly future \nbiofuel markets. We are exploring the opportunities for expanded seaweed aquaculture in the Caribbean and the Gulf of \nMexico in collaboration with partners at 15 institutions and research sites in Puerto Rico, Florida, and Belize. Together we \nare prototyping cultivation systems that allow farms to be deployed in offshore areas, creating tools to mechanize seeding \nand harvesting, assessing the environmental impacts of these farm systems, characterizing the growth and composition \nof tropical algae in near and offshore environments, and conducting economic and life cycle analyses of macroalgal \naquaculture systems in this region. Findings from these efforts will be tailored to the conditions in the Caribbean and The \nGulf of Mexico and be adaptable for other locations with similar environmental threats or needs for alternative marine \nlivelihoods.\nIn this presentation we will explain how insight from our field research is being combined with consultation from local \nstakeholders to guide the development of Ecological Best Management Practices (BMP) for seaweed aquaculture in the \nGulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Our intention is that these ecological BMPs will support prospective seaweed \nfarmers, resource managers, and buyers through ecologically and socially responsible decision-making around seaweed \naquaculture. Fostering sustainable expansion of Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico macroalgal cultivation will encourage \nproduction in these regions to expand beyond the existing small-scale farms producing seaweed for artisanal beverage and \ncosmeceutical markets. Establishing larger-scale farms in a responsible manner will enable production of algal biomass for \nadditional local and global markets and allow resource managers to consider seaweed farming as an extractive component \nof an integrated water quality management strategy. \nOne of our candidate \nspecies, Eucheumatopsis \nisiformis , which is native \nto the region.\n213\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALPHA DIVERSITY AND RHODOBACTERACEAE \nVIBRIONALES RATIO AS AN INDICATOR OF GUT HEALTH OF WHITELEG SHRIMP \nLitopenaeus vannamei\nAna Rodiles1*, Florian Geay2, Eric Leclercq1, Stephane Ralite1 and Mathieu Castex1\n1Lallemand Animal Nutrition; Blagnac, France 2BioMar Group; Trondheim, Norway\narodiles@lallemand.com\nThe use of the 16S rRNA marker genes is gaining momentum as a practical tool to appraise the role of intestinal microbiota \nin shrimp culture. High-throughput sequencing produces an enormous amount of data and results are often expressed by the \nrelative abundance of bacteria taxa, however this approach introduces a bias in the absence of microbial load quantification. \nLatest advance in managing 16S sequencing data contemplates the log ratio between bacteria, which automatically cancels \nthis bias, by comparing the ratios of different taxa between samples instead of the relative abundance of individual taxa \n(Morton et al., 2019). We applied this approach to shrimp microbiota data sets by looking at the relationship between \nalpha diversity and the ratio between two important taxa in the shrimp intestinal microbiota: the family Rhodobacteraceae \nand the class Vibrionales. Indeed Rhodobacteraceae includes many beneficial bacteria species while Vibrionales contains \nwell-known opportunist and pathogenic species, suggesting the Rhodobacteraceae/Vibrionales (R/V) ratio as a potential \nbiomarker of gut microbial health and welfare in shrimp.\nData were compiled from 4 independent pond trials performed in Vietnam over the grows-out phase, hence covering \na variety of dietary, environmental and sanitary conditions. A total of 196 hindgut samples were included with the same \nmolecular approach applied for DNA extraction, PCR primers and bioinformatics processing.\nHigh-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region was analysed with DADA2 independently per trial, then \nShannon diversity index and ratio Rhodobacteraceae/Vibrionales values were computed to test a potential correlation on \nQIIME2 (Bolyen et al., 2019), a python-based microbiome platform.\nResults showed a highly significant correlation between the R/V log ratio and Shannon alpha diversity index (r = 0.76;  \nP = 0.000; Fig. 1). R/V ratio showed a wider range of 15 (-9 to 6; min max) showed a wider range of 15 (-9 to 6; min max) \ncompared to 7 for shannon (1 to 8).

En cada tratamiento, el estadio de desarrollo \nNaef (1928), morfometr\u00eda embrionaria y tiempo de \ndesarrollo embrionario fueron medidos. Se realiz\u00f3 un \ngr\u00e1fico PCO y un PERMANOV A con ayuda del programa \nestad\u00edstico PRIMER-e. \nLa temperatura afect\u00f3 de manera inversamente proporcional \nal tiempo de desarrollo embrionario. T26 fue 6 d\u00edas m\u00e1s \nlargo que T28, siendo este el tiempo m\u00e1s corto (31 d\u00edas). \nS36 y S38 obtuvieron un tiempo de desarrollo de 33 d\u00edas.  \nMientras que, T30 y S40 generaron un efecto delet\u00e9reo. \nMalformaciones en embriones fueron observadas en T30 y, \nS38 y S40. \nEl PCO1 del gr\u00e1fico de temperatura explic \u00f3 el 74.2% de la \nvariaci\u00f3n, principalmente por el ancho del huevo, longitud \ndel manto, longitud del brazo y volumen del saco vitelino. \nEl cambi\u00f3 en la morfometr\u00eda fue diferente a lo largo del \ntiempo dependiendo del tratamiento t\u00e9rmico ( p<0.05). T30 \nmodific\u00f3 el cambio en la morfometr\u00eda de los embriones, \nretrasando el aumento en todas las variables medidas, en \nespecial el largo del brazo y el ancho del huevo. \nEl PCO1 de salinidad explic\u00f3 el 78.67% de la variaci\u00f3n, \nprincipalmente por el ancho del huevo, longitud total del \nembri\u00f3n, longitud del manto, longitud del brazo y volumen \ndel saco vitelino. La morfometr\u00eda cambi\u00f3 a lo largo del \ntiempo, pero lo hizo de la misma manera para todos los \ntratamientos de salinidad. En general, los embriones de \nS40 tuvieron una morfometr\u00eda diferente a lo largo del \nexperimento en comparaci\u00f3n al resto. ( p<0.05).\nModificaciones en el tiempo del desarrollo por temperatura han sido observados en otros pulpos ( O. vulgaris, maya, mimus, \ntehuelchus,  etc.). As\u00ed mismo, temperaturas fuera del rango \u00f3ptimo de cada especie han reportado bajas fecundidades, tasas \nde eclosi\u00f3n e interrupci\u00f3n del desarrollo.

No se encontraron diferencias \nsignificativas en el crecimiento (peso y longitud), y supervivencia entre los distintos tratamientos y los controles. No \nobstante, los valores obtenidos en el porcentaje final de machos presentaron diferencias significativas, siendo el control \npositivo (alimento con hormona sin extracto) en el que se obtuvo la masculinizaci\u00f3n del total de los organismos de prueba, \nobservando una disminuci\u00f3n del porcentaje de machos del 11% al 13%, por efecto de la suplementaci\u00f3n con el extracto \nde alga, siendo el alimento suplementado al 3%, el que present\u00f3 la menor masculinizaci\u00f3n (87%). Esta disminuci\u00f3n en la \ntasa de masculinizaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda deberse a una competencia por el receptor esteroideo, entre el andr\u00f3geno y algunos de los \ncompuestos fitoqu\u00edmicos (fenoles y flavonoides) presentes en el extracto con afinidad por dicho receptor. Se concluy\u00f3 que \nla inclusi\u00f3n del extracto no causa alteraci\u00f3n en la supervivencia final, pero si disminuye la tasa de masculinizaci\u00f3n, por lo \nque se requiere profundizar sobre el efecto como protector de disruptores endocrinos por parte de compuestos presentes \nen esta macroalga.216\nEFECTOS POSITIVOS DE LA APLICACI\u00d3N CONTINUA DE PROBI\u00d3TICOS \nCOMERCIALES PARA EL MANEJO DE TILAPIA ROJA CULTIV ADA EN AGUA DE MAR \nCON BIOFLOC\nGustavo A.

Marine macroalgae contain various polysaccharides such as frame polysaccharides, mucopolysaccharides, \nand storage polysaccharides. \nIn our study we used common extraction methods, which include various steps of pretreatment, using solvents for \nextraction, precipitation, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Pretreatments are necessary to remove chlorophylls, \nmannitol, salts, and other small compounds. Dry algal powder was suspended in ethanol, and the mixture was continuously \nstirred with a mechanical stirrer at room temperature. After filtration the same procedures were applied using acetone and \ndichloromethane. The residual material was then extracted with 0.1 M HCl (60 \u00b0C, 2 hours), centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 40 \nminutes, and the supernatant precipitated with ethanol (overnight, 2-8 \u00b0C). The precipitated polysaccharides were filtered-\noff, washed with ethanol and acetone, air-dried and analysed.\nThe molecular weights were determined by HPLC on Agilent 1260 Infinity II instrument, equipped with a refractive \nindeks detector G7162A.

Due to this, population restoration \nactions have been proposed, such as the translocation of wild individuals or the release of captive-bred juveniles in reserve \nor non-fishing areas. To determine the optimal size of the reserve areas, it is necessary to know the potential dispersal \nof individuals throughout their life cycle, which is generally based on studies of the movement patterns and short-term \ndispersal rates.  The objective of this work was to estimate the movement patterns and dispersal rates of I. badionotus  to \nprovide key knowledge for the design of protection zones for the species.\nA set of experiments were carried out under semi-controlled conditions, in external ponds with 50% sun protection and \nnatural fluctuation of temperature and solar radiation. Fifty-five organisms classified as small, medium and large were used \nto determine the pattern and magnitude of movement in daily cycles, as well as its relationship with temperature and solar \nradiation. The preference for the use of colonized and non-colonized artificial refuges was also evaluated. The movement \nrates were obtained using a camera located in a zenithal position above the experimental tank. Differences in displacement \nwere identified between large and small cucumbers (ANOV A, p = 0.0252, Tukey HSD). The average daily movement for \nthe size class was: 518 cm for small, 615 cm for medium sizes and 688 cm for large sizes (Table 1). The displacement \npattern was characterized by a very low displacement in the mornings (07:00 to 14:00), a maximum in the afternoon (16:00 \nto 22:00) and intermediate at night (23:00 to 5:00). A positive linear relationship was determined between organism size \n(estimated length: eL) and total daily displacement (D) (D = 2.88 eL + 22.27 cm). Positive correlations (Spearman: rs) \nwere obtained between the displacement of large and medium organisms with temperature (rs: 0.48, 0.89) while, negative \nrs values were observed between displacement and light intensity in small organisms (rs: - 0.44, - 0.74).  Higher percentage \nof use of refuge by small organisms (53% of the daily time) and greater affinity for colonized refuges (80% of refuge \nuse) were observed. Medium and large organisms did not presented shelter preferences (<20% of the daily time). This \ndemonstrates the importance of shelters. Daily movements found in this work are similar to other sea cucumbers species, \nbeing most active in the afternoon and at night, and provides specific data for long dispersion models for I. badionotus.\n219\nINTENSIFIED CULTIV ATION OF THE MACROPHYTIC RED ALGA Gracilaria \nvermiculophylla  ON POROUS MESH PANELS IN RACEWAY PONDS\nJoseph A. Kraai, Sanford Evans and Christopher Langdon and Gregory L. Rorrer*\nSchool of Chemical, Biological, and Environmental Engineering, Oregon State University\nCorvallis, Oregon, 97331 USA\ngregory.rorrer@oregonstate.edu\nNew approaches are needed to automate and intensify the cultivation of commercially important red macroalgae.  Using cell \nand tissue culture techniques, we have developed clonal cultures for the macrophytic red alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla \nthat can be vegetatively propagated, mechanically blended into fragments, and then fluidically injected onto a mesh \nsupport. This alga has high carbohydrate content and exhibits broad temperature, salinity, and pH tolerance.  Panels of \nG. vermiculophylla  clonal tissue were stacked upright in dense array within a circular raceway pond, where fluid flowed \nover stationary mats of tissue ( Fig. 1 ).  Since the macroalgae grew as a dense, porous mat ( Fig. 2 ), biomass loading \nwas densified within the cultivation control volume, leading to enhanced areal productivity. Cultivation performance was \nassessed in Microbio Engineering 100 L (0.5RWi) raceways in both laboratory controlled and greenhouse environments \nunder nutrient replete conditions.  Laboratory raceway cultivations were carried out at 22 oC, 8000 ppm CO2 in air at 0.010 \nL air L-1culture min-1, and 800 mmol photons m-2s-1 (16:8 photoperiod) with 8 cm panel spacing and 15 cm/s fluid velocity. \nAt these conditions, the G. vermculophylla  tissue fragments proliferated over the panel surface, ultimately creating a loose \nmat of tissue nearly 8-10 cm in thickness with biomass loading exceeding 10 kg FW per m2 of panel surface over the 24 day \ngrow out period.   The cumulative areal productivity was 58 \u00b1 9 g AFDW m-2 day-1 and final biomass density of 7 g AFDW \nL-1 (Fig. 3 ).  Overall, dense arrays of stationary G. vermiculophylla  panels cultivated under defined current flow in open \nraceways offer future potential for high productivity and modular deployment for aquaculture applications in land-based \nor open-water environments. \n220\nEMBRYO QUALITY IN THE VOLUNTARY SPAWNING OF FIRST-GENERATION (F1) \nBARRED SAND BASS  Paralabrax nebulifer KEPT IN CAPTIVITY\nMart\u00edn O.

In this investigation, a broodstock was \nestablished from juveniles produced in the laboratory (F1) of barred sand bass Paralabrax nebulifer  with the use of RAS \nand voluntary spawning quality obtained under controlled conditions was evaluated. \nThe juveniles grow-out and gonadal conditioning is implemented with the photoperiod and temperature control (13:11 \nL:D; 22 \u00baC) in a RAS, which facilities the voluntary spawning in captivity. The broodstock group was composed of 6 \nfemales:4 males. To assess the quality of spawnings, the following parameters were determinated: volume of floating \nand non-floating embryos (Figure 1), embryo diameter, oil globule diameter, notochordal length (NL), yolk sac volume, \nhatching rate and survival percentage. The embryos/larvae were observed daily from day 0 to 3 days after hatching (DAH). \nThe total number of spawns obtained each month was compared by means of a one-way analysis of variance. Statistical \nanalysis was performed with the software Statistic 10.0. \nThe highest volumes of floating embryos were observed during April to June. In the embryos, the mean diameter was 0.88 \n\u00b1 0.02 mm. The hatching percentage between the evaluation months did not show significant differences and had a mean \nvalue of 73.4 %, while the average survival percentage was 32.4 %. In the eleutheroembryos and apterolarvae, there were \nnot significant differences in the mean NL at 1 and 3 DAH and it was 1.64 \u00b1 0.24 mm and 2.16 \u00b1 0.19 mm respectively. \nAlthough larval survival is still a factor to consider, being able to conclude the life cycle and have reproductive availability \nin the captivity offers a significant step for to achieve the cultivation of this species.\n221\nEFFECT OF WATER TEMPERATURE ON EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT AND \nHATCHING TIME OF THE BARRED SAND BASS  Paralabrax nebulifer (PERCIFORMES: \nSERRANIDAE)\nMart\u00edn O.

Playa Palo de Santa Rita, 23096, La Paz, Baja California Sur, M\u00e9xico\nE-mail: mrosales0400@ipn.mx\nIn recent decades, aquaculture has been one of the highest growing food production sectors from an animal source. The \nbarred sand bass Paralabrax nebulifer , is one of the most important sources of small-scale commercial fisheries which \nrepresents the largest economic stream for cooperatives in Baja California Sur. Being a species of great fishery importance, \nit can be said that this species can also be of aquacultural importance. Being temperature a primary factor  in the survival \nand growth of many aquatic organisms, the intention is to evaluate and determine an adequate temperature at which a better \nsurvival of embryos during incubation of the barred sand bass can be observed. \nEggs were obtained by voluntary spawning, the incubation of embryos were carried out at controlled water temperatures \n(23, 25, 27, and 29 \u00baC). To determine the optimal incubation temperature a system was constructed consisting of 4 incubators \neach at different temperatures. Four steel inserts were used to attain the water temperature of 23 \u00b0C, this was regulated \nthrough the control of ambient temperature with the help of an air-conditioning mini-Split in automatic mode.  We used \nresistance immersion heaters to increase the temperature to 25, 27, and 29 \u00b0C. The incubators were maintained in constant \naeration for a better dispersion of temperature throughout the water. The embryos were randomly selected and transferred \nin 24-well microtiter plates (one embryo per well). Each well was filled with 3.0 ml UV-sterilized sea water and were \ntaken to the incubation area, each temperature treatment was replicated three times. During the incubation, the photoperiod \n(13:11 L:O) was kept up with neon lights. To ensure accurate measurements of the time intervals, the microtiter plates \nwere examined every 6 hours to determine the hatching status and health of the embryos and larvae, for which a dissecting \nmicroscope was used. To obtain the LD50 (average lethal dose), after which 50% of the organisms died, a binary logistic \nregression \u201cprobit\u201d was applied using the Minitab program. \nAccording to survival probality program the LD50 was 22.4 \u00b0C (Figure).   This indicates that 50% of the embryos survived \nto this temperature. The incubation period is particularly sensitive to extreme temperatures within the tested temperature \nrange. \nFrom a probabilistic perspective, the binary logistic model revels that at 22.4 degrees, an organism has a 50% probability \nof survival.\n222\nLA ACUACULTURA EN YUCAT\u00c1N: UNA PROPUESTA QUE ARTICULA A LOS SECTORES \nSOCIALES, ACADEMICOS Y GUBERNAMENTALES\nCarlos Rosas1*, Claudia Caamal-Monsreal1 Pedro Gallardo1, Cristina Pascual1, Maite Mascar\u00f31, Arely Paredes1, \nLaura Vidal1, Diana de Yta1, Marco Antonio Ponce1, Adolfo S\u00e1nchez Zamora1, Gemma L Mart\u00ednez Moreno1, \nGabriela Gaxiola1, Manuel Valenzuela1, Claudia Durruty1, Carlos Maldonado1, Miguel Olvera-Novoa2,\nVictor Vidal2, Dalila Aldana2, Martha Rosalia Enriquez Diaz, Mariel Gullian Klanjan3, Miguel Vela Maga\u00f1a3, \nJavier Aranda Nah2, Maria Luisa Isla2, Juan Jos\u00e9 Sandoval-Gio4, Ma de los \u00c1ngeles Sanchez5, \nManuel O.

In the case of Mexico and particularly \nin the Yucatan Peninsula, the Octopus maya is a species with a high commercial value whose biological characteristics \nfavour the development of farming methods. Although females spawn only once in their lives, they produce between 800 \nand 1,500 eggs per spawning, with a hatching rate of between 75 and 80%. One of the advantages of this species is that the \nnewly hatched juveniles are benthic, which feed on live prey, dead, fresh, frozen, and even balanced food.\nThe Faculty of Sciences (UNAM-Sisal Yucat\u00e1n) has the capacity to the production of 20 thousand embryos/month, \nartificially incubated.  The juveniles are placed in outside ponds at a density of 10 octopuses/m2, where they are fed at \n100% of their biomass until they reach 2 to 3 g. Subsequently, the octopuses are separated by size to avoid cannibalism and \nfed at a rate of 50% of their weight. Survival of 50% can be obtained with growth rates ranging between 4 and 6% day-1.\nAt present, the Science Faculty of the UNAM has established a collaboration agreement with the SCPP Molluscos del \nMayab to start a farm for the production of O. maya juveniles with a maximum weight of 150g. This farm will be the \nfirst of its kind, with the primary objective of conducting a bio-economic study to establish production costs in this pre-\ncommercial stage. Soon, the Cooperative will need to be injected with capital to build the reproduction, incubation, and \npre-growth modules. With that capital, it will be possible to reach a pre-commercial octopus farm. At the same time, the \ninstallation of a food production plant is planned that serves to feed the octopuses and takes advantage of the waste from \nthe fishing industry in the region.224\nMITIGATION OF SOYBEAN MEAL-INDUCED ENTERITIS IN RAINBOW TROUT \nOncorhynchus mykiss  USING BILE SALT DIETARY SUPPLEMENTATION \nMarina M. Rubio-Benito* Nicholas Romano, Kenneth Overturf, and Vikas Kumar\nAquaculture Research Institute, Department of Animal, Veterinary and Food Sciences, University of Idaho, \nMoscow, ID, 83844, USA\nmrubiobenito@uidaho.edu\nThe replacement of fish meal (FM) in aquafeeds by alternative sources of protein such as plant ingredients like soybean meal \n(SBM) has typically encountered a variety of challenges at high levels of inclusion, especially in carnivorous species like \nrainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ). The development of intestinal inflammation, in this context referred to as soybean \nmeal-induced enteritis, is a noteworthy sign of reduced tolerance to SBM, and there is an array of approaches that have \nbeen explored to alleviate inflammation. Bile salts (BS) have recently been suggested to have a role in immune signaling \nregulation, and we have therefore hypothesized their potential as feed supplements towards SBM diets improvement.   \nThe goal of this study was to evaluate the potential mechanisms by which BS might exert a protective effect on reducing \ninflammation and restore barrier function in rainbow trout over a long-term experimental period. A total of 2,000 fish \ninitially weighing ~ 40.0 \u00b1 1.0 g, were randomly distributed into 20 350-L tanks (100 fish/tank). Five experimental diets \n(isonitrogenous: 42% crude protein and isolipidic: 20% lipid) including a FM diet (control), a SBM30 diet (30% inclusion \nlevel), a SBM40 diet (40% inclusion level) and two SBM-BS supplemented diets (1.5% BS supplemented to each SBM \ndiet) were fed to apparent satiation for 18 weeks. During the trial fish were sampled three times at 6, 12, and 18 weeks.  \nFeed intake was recorded daily, and fish weight was measured at each sampling point. Samples were collected from the \ndistal intestine for gene expression analyses of the inflammatory markers: TNF-\u03b1, NF- \u03baB, IL-8, IL-10; barrier function \nmarkers: MLCK, occludin and claudins; as well as the bile brush border transporter TGR5 and basolateral transporter \nOST\u03b1. Similarly, liver gene expression analysis was done on the bile acid synthesis enzyme. Digesta was taken from \nproximal and distal intestine 12 hrs. after feeding for bile acid quantification and resorption calculation. Distal intestine and \nliver samples were also collected for histology analysis.\nNo significant differences ( p > 0.05) in weight gain were observed, but fish fed the SBM40 diet showed slightly higher \nweight gain in the BS supplemented diet compared to the non-supplemented one (Fig. 1), and this was supported by \nsignificantly higher ( p < 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR) at 18 weeks. Histology analyses in liver and distal intestine also \nindicate a mitigating effect of BS supplementation in diets containing up to 40% SBM.\n225\nPRODUCTION AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF JAPANESE OYSTERS IN BAJA \nCALIFORNIA SUR FOR THE NATIONAL AND EXPORT MARKET\nArmando Ru\u00edz*\nOysterBlue.

Its quality is closely \nrelated to the means of fertilization used for its cultivation, being the F/2 Guillard the most used. Chemical silage from fish \nwaste, with high nitrogen and carbon content, can be an alternative. In this study, the effect of chemical silage from fish \nwaste as a supplement, complement and total substitute for the commercial culture medium F/2 Guillard on the growth of \nthe microalgae Tetraselmis chuii  and Chaetoceros muelleri  was evaluated.\nThe silage was made with waste from the \u201cChac-chi\u201d fish \n(Haemulon plumierii ) according to Gallardo et al (2012) \nfrom the catch of riverside fishermen from the port of Sisal, \nYucatan, Mexico. The pH and soluble protein content during \nsilage was recorded (31 days).\nTwo experiments were carried out to evaluate the effect of \npartial and total replacement of the F/2 Guillard medium on \nthe population growth of T. chuii  (Exp. 1) and Ch. muelleri  \n(Exp. 2) (Table 1) during 10 and 8 days respectively. The \ncultures of both microalgae were carried out in 500 ml \nErlenmeyer flasks.\nSilage as a complement and supplement to F/2 Guillard \nallowed higher concentrations (cell ml-1) of T. chuii  with TB \nand TA on day 9 of culture, respectively (Fig. 1a). In the case \nof diatoms, the highest concentration was obtained on day 5 \nof culture with the TA (5.15 x 10-6 cel ml-1) and where only \nthe silage (TC) was used (4.4 x 10-6 cel ml- 1) (Fig. 1b).\nThe results obtained indicate that the chemical silage of fish \nwaste with a high content of nitrogen and other elements, \nprovided nutrients that were beneficial for the growth of \nmicroalgae and that it can be used as an enrichment or partial replacement of the F/2 Guillard medium for T. chuii . In the \ncase of Ch. muelleri , the results indicate that the silage allowed a total replacement of the commercial medium F/2 Guillard.\nLiterature\nGallardo P., \u2026., and Sotelo A. 2012.

Microbiota, the range \nof microorganisms that can be found in a multicellular organism can be affected by environmental factors such as pH, \ntemperatura, and salinity with an influence in metabolism, growth, and development among other vital processes. The \nrelationship between the microbiota and the host is known as the holobiont system. The gut microbiota has been extensively \nstudied in several species of fish, however information regarding Epinephelus morio  remains largely elusive. The objective \nof this study was to characterize the cultivable gut microbiota of E. morio  in addition to implementing a new protocol for \ngut microbiota sampling in vivo .\nFor this purpose, 3 wild red grouper adults captured off the Yucat\u00e1n Coast and taken to the facilities of the UMDI-Sisal of \nthe Faculty of Sciences, UNAM were studied. They were anesthetized with clove oil, then a medical probe and a syringe \nwere used to aspirate gut content from the cloaca.

The Caribbean spiny lobster, \nPanulirus argus,  supports valuable commercial fisheries through the wider Caribbean region. Since the last decade, this \nspecies has been affected by a highly pathogenic virus known as Panulirus argus  Virus 1 (PaV1). The present study \nanalyzes the immune response of lobsters under an experimental viral infection. \nNinety juvenile P . argus  were distributed in three tanks with an approximate capacity of 150 liters of water connected \nto a recirculation system with 300% daily replacement. Subsequently, one organism with signs of PaV1 infection was \nintroduced into each pond for 120 days.\nHemolymph was extracted to determine the activity of the immuno-physiological components of the peripheral system. \nDiagnosis of infection was made by qPCR using samples from the hepatopancreas. Immunological evaluations were also \nperformed: hemagglutination activity and total phenoloxidase activity (PO).\nStatistical analysis (ANOV A), showed a decrease in the levels of hemocytes, hemagglutinating activity, and hemo-cyanin \nconcentration. On the other hand, the phenoloxidase system did not show significant differences. However, the components \nof this system showed a decrease in plasma total phenoloxidase and an increase in hemocyte granule phenoloxidase. The \nresults suggest that experimental viral infection produce a defense response similar to natural pathways of contagion, and \nprovides the bases to validate an immunological challenge protocol for crustaceans.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was carried out with the support of the UNAM (PAPIIT IN217322, IT201621).\n230\nEXTRUSION PROCESSING OF FISH FEED PELLETS: INFLUENCE OF SILICA AND OIL \nCONTENT ON THE PRODUCT PROPERTIES \n \nM.

KG, Duisburg (Germany)\nSilica Applied Technology Consumer, Health and Nutrition; Evonik Operations GmbH, Hanau (Germany) \nFulda University of Applied Sciences, Department of Food Engineering, Fulda (Germany)\nEmail: maria.graefenhahn@brabender.com\n \nOver the last several decades, aquaculture has gained importance since wild capture can no longer meet the global demand \nfor fish. Therefore, this market has grown exponentially, and with it, the demand for fish feed. In particular feed with high \namounts of fat has gained relevance, since it allows for many species (e.g. salmon, trout) the most efficient growth and, \nthus, farming.\nExtrusion processing is often used to produce fish feed pellets. Within the heated barrel containing rotating screws, the raw \nmaterials are mixed, heated, and sheared along the extruder. The combined thermal and mechanical stresses applied to the \nmaterial lead to its plasticization and cooking. Due to the temperature and pressure gradients between the melt and the room \nconditions, the material can expand after it leaves the die and is pelletized through a rotating knife. Although addition of \noil is desired, it has a negative influence on the cooking process during extrusion, as its lubricating properties reduce the \nspecific thermal and mechanical energy input and, consequently, the degree of cook. In general, a lower degree of cook \nhas a negative influence on the product quality of the feed pellets, i.e. decreased water stability and hardness. Therefore, \nto cook the material sufficiently and to achieve the aimed product properties, manufacturers avoid adding high oil levels \nduring extrusion. Instead, manufacturers add oil in a separate coating step post-extrusion. This additional step makes the \nproduction of aquatic feed more complicated and expensive. Additionally, if fat does not bind properly to the pellets fat \nleakage can occur, whereby the fat drains out of the pellet, consequently, leading to increased fat oxidation.  The addition \nof additives, especially silica, would serve to resolve these issues while achieving high fat levels in high quality fish feed \npellets without a coating step. Since the increase of fat leads to a decrease in the matrix viscosity, the mechanical energy \ninput is expected to decrease leading to a lower degree of cook. As silica is known for its water and oil binding capacity as \nwell as for its ability to control rheology and therefore to increase viscosity, its addition is expected to counteract this effect \nleading to an enhanced gelatinization during the extrusion process. This strategy will be introduced and the relationship \nbetween process conditions, addition of different oil and silica concentrations and resulting product properties (among \nothers pellet hardness, pellet abrasion and fat content) will be evaluated. 231\nFROM LA PAZ TO MEXICO AND THE WORLD, WITH LOVE, THE KAMPACHI \nCOMPANY:  A RIPPLE EFFECT ANALYSIS\n \nJorge Schmidt*\nKampachi Farms Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V .\nLos Delfines 225, Segunda Planta\nFraccionamiento La Selva Fidepaz, C.P. 23090\nLa Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico\njorge.schmidt@kampachi.mx\nLaunched in October 2017, in and about La Paz, B.C.S.

The road to success from start up to successful \nproduction is discussed for a new knowledge-based enterprise.\nIn four years after securing investment, including two full years of a full pandemic, the King Kampachi project in La \nPaz, Baja California Sur went from zero to more than one thousand tons of Seriola rivoli ana fish ready for the Mexican \nand export markets. Along the way, many significant goals were achieved. Among them, a domestic company (Nutec) \nbecame the high quality feed supplier for the company, all the processes and permits required for fertilized egg export were \nobtained, and a new product, Kampachito  (little Kampachi), was developed. All this while complying with strict internal \nregulatory collaboration and certification processes.233\nBENEFITS OF ADJUSTING TRACE MINERAL PREMIX IN SHRIMP FEED\u2013 A MEXICAN \nFIELD STUDY \nKurt Servin Arce*, Jos\u00e9 Paez Manrique, Simon David, Cl\u00e1udia Figueiredo-Silva#\nNutrimentos Acuicola Azteca SA\nnutricion@aztecamexico.mx \n# csilva@zinpro.com\nReplacement of inorganic mineral premix (sulfates) with complete metal-AA complexes (i.e. Zinpro Performance \nMinerals\u00ae, ZPM) at 0.5x rate of inorganic, resulted in numerically higher body weight, 8.3% reduced FCR, and reduced \nmortality of shrimp challenged with Vibrio harveyi  (Jintasataporn et al., 2015). Metal-amino acid complexes have an \nabsorption advantage over inorganic minerals, because they are minimally antagonized by dietary components such as \nphytic acid and utilize the AA transporters instead of common metal transporters. Davis et al. (1993) reported that L. \nvanammei  required 33 ppm Zn to maintain normal growth and maximize Zn concentration in hepatopancreas, whereas \n200 ppm inorganic Zn was required to overcome depressed Zn bioavailability caused by phytates. More recently, Yuan \nand co-authors reported improved growth performance and health of shrimp when replacing 120 ppm zinc sulphate with \n60 ppm Zn-AA complex (Yuan et al. 2020) and 30 ppm Cu sulphate with 15 ppm Cu-AA complex (Yuan et al., 2019a,b).  \nImportantly, increasing Zn-AA complex from 60 to 80 ppm further improved shrimp health-related parameters (Shi et al., \n2021). The present study aimed to evaluate benefits of replacing inorganic trace mineral premix with metal-AA complexes \n(ZPM) on shrimp performance and survival rate under commercial conditions. Shrimp of 0.5 g initial body weight were \ngrown for ~100 days (cycle varying from 95-130 days) in earthen ponds at a stocking density of 100 shrimp per m2 and 5-6 \nppt. Feeds were produced at a commercial feed plant in Mexico, following ingredient and nutrient composition of a typical \ncommercial shrimp feed. Four feeds were produced, varying in their trace mineral premix, as described in embedded table. \nInorganic trace mineral premix used in the Control diet was combined with ZPM premix (Control+ZPM) or completely \nreplaced with ZPM (ZPM diet). An additional diet was produced to include fortified ZPM premix (ZPM+), by giving \nspecial attention to trace minerals critical in the modulation of shrimp immune system (Zn, Se, Cu, and Cr). Replacement \nof inorganic premix with ZPM doubled shrimp survival rate. Fortifying trace mineral premix by combining inorganic with \nZPM (higher total levels) or using ZPM+, tended to further increase survival rates. Regardless of the treatment, adjustment \nof inorganic trace mineral premix with ZPM increased final biomass and significantly reduced FCR, translating in positive \nreturn on investment (ROI, measured by additional income over feed cost) under commercial conditions. Best ROI was \nfound with ZPM+ treatment (>150%).  \n234\nESTIMATION OF CHOLINE REQUIREMENT AND EFFECTS OF DIETARY LIPID \nLEVEL AND ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE ON THE SEVERITY OF LIPID \nACCUMULATION IN ATLANTIC SALMON ( Salmo Salar L .)\nDaphne Siciliani, Anne K. Hansen*, Trond M. Kortner*, Elin C. Valen*, Elvis M. Chikwati*, \u00c5shild Krogdahl*\nDepartment of Paraclinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, \nOslo, Norway\nE-mail: daphne.siciliani@nmbu.no\nBackground \nThe dietary shift of farmed Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar L. ) from fish-based to plant-based protein has revealed new \nchallenges concerning the dietary requirements necessary to ensure fish health. Among the nutrients lacking in plant feeds, \ncholine deficiency can lead to the presence of excessive unabsorbed fat within the intestinal enterocytes, a condition \nknown as Lipid Malabsorption Syndrome (LMS). However, knowledge over the minimum dietary choline requirement in \nAtlantic salmon is still limited. It is also likely that the amount may vary across a salmon\u2019s life, reflecting growth demands \nand changes in diet. Here we present part of two experiments conducted to establish the choline requirement in post-\nsmolt Atlantic salmon and determine whether this requirement may be affected by different dietary lipid levels and water \ntemperatures.\nMaterials and Methods \nAn initial dose-response experiment was performed to achieve a first estimation of minimum choline requirement. A fish-\nbased control diet and eight plant-based diets supplemented with different levels of choline chloride were made and fed to \npost-smolt Atlantic salmon. In a subsequent experiment, four choline-deficient plant diets with differing lipid concentrations \nwere provided to fish raised at 8 and 15 \u02daC to assess the influence of lipid level and water temperature. At the end of each \nfeeding trial, fish were sacrificed, and body measurements were taken. The fish were then opened, and the organ package \nremoved. The intestinal tract was detached from the other organs, cleaned of external fat and divided into the pyloric (PI), \nmid (MI) and distal (DI) sections which were then weighed and sampled. Tissue samples from all the fish were processed \nto perform gene expression analyses and histological assessments.\nResults\nBiomarkers of various indicators of lipid assembly, storage and transport showed an inverse relationship with the increasing \ncholine level in the diet. These elements were selected as main factors to determine choline requirement and indicated that \na dietary inclusion of 3.4 g/kg is necessary to prevent LMS symptoms in post-smolt Atlantic salmon kept under similar \nconditions. The results showed a clear dose response relationship between fat percentage and lipid accumulation both at a \nhistological and molecular level. On the other hand, water temperature only had a significant effect when interacting with \ndietary lipid concentration.  235\nLAMBARI Astyanax lacustris AND MUSTARD MICROGREENS Brassica juncea \nPRODUCTION IN SLIGHTLY SALINE AQUAPONIC SYSTEMS\nLaura Silva*, Jesaias I. Costa, Isabela C. de Almeida, Maria C\u00e9lia Portella.\nUniversidade Estadual Paulista (Unesp), Centro de Aquicultura da Unesp, Jaboticabal, Brazil\nAddress: Via de Acesso Professor Paulo Donato Castellane, s/n - Vila Industrial, Jaboticabal, SP, \nBrazil, 14884-900. \nlaura.patricia@unesp.br \nIn freshwater aquaculture, a more isosmotic environment achieved through salinity control may favor fish growth since \nless energy would be spent for the osmoregulatory process. A 57-day experimental trial was conducted to study aquaponics \non-demand coupled system using lambari ( Astyanax lacustris ) and mustard ( Brassica juncea ), species reported as tolerant \nto slightly saline conditions. The mustard was cultured as microgreens given their high sales price, short culture cycle and \nlow nutrient demand. Two treatments (1.0 and 2.0 g NaCl L-1) with four replicates each, were established. An aquaponics \non-demand control without salt addition (0) and a hydroponic control (MHy) for the microgreens were also settled, each \none with four replicates. During the trial, one lambari and five microgreen culture cycles (9 day each) were completed. At \nthe end of the trial, the lambari (Table 1) and all the microgreen cycles (Table 2 presents only cycles with the highest and \nlowest microgreen harvests) performances in the 1.0 and 2.0 treatments were statistically similar to the controls (ANOV A, \np>0.05). However, lambari asymptotic weight was achieved earlier in the 2.0 treatment compared with the control and the \n1.0 treatment (Fig.1). \nIn conclusion, the use of slightly saline water (2g NaCl L-1) in aquaponics on-demand coupled systems may accelerate \nlambari growth without compromising mustard microgreen production if compared with the performance on RAS (0g \nNaCl L-1) and hydroponic systems, respectively.\nFunding agencies: FAPESP, grants 2018/23658-5,  2018/23605-9 and 2017/50431-9, cnpq, grants 139130/2020 and \n311108/2017-2.\n236\nIS ESCHERICIA COLI A GOOD INDICATOR OF POSSIBLE FECAL CONTAMINATION \nOF CATFISH FILLETS?\nMaria Gabriela Hidalgo, Shecoya White, Angelica Abdallah Ruiz, Meredith Maynard, Lauryn Heidelberg, \nand Juan L. Silva*\nDepartment of Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion\nMississippi State University \nBox 9805\nMississippi State, MS 39762\njsilva@foodscience.msstate.edu\nIn 2017, USDA-FSIS compliance guidelines for Siluriformes, implemented the testing of generic Escherichia coli  to \nensure product wholesomeness and safety. The BAP standards for processed fish call for rejection of sample if from \nn= 5 subsamples, 3 or more subsamples exceed 4 MPN per gram or any subsample exceed 40 MPN per gram. Others \nhave placed a limit of 1 CFU/g.  E. coli  and other indicator organisms in catfish, liquid and environment of processing \nfacilities were assessed by season and time of day. Environmental, fish, and liquid samples were collected in 3MTM \nSwab-Sampler (with 10 ml of Buffered Peptone Water) and Whirl-pak\u00ae sterilized stomacher bags respectively from two \ndifferent catfish processing plants. (site) located in the state of Mississippi, USA. Replications were defined by the number \nof visits. Each two visits represented a season and for each visit, 25 samples were collected. All samples were plated on the \nfollowing corresponding media: aerobic plate (APC), psychotropic plate (PPC), and indicator organisms: generic E. coli , \ntotal coliforms (TCC), and Enterobacter following FDA-BAM and AOAC methods. Escherichia coli  counts were similar \n(P \u2264 0.05) for all sampling points with slightly higher incidence in the late Summer than the other seasons. Within the types \nof sampling, liquid and fish part sample had higher counts than (p\u22640.05) environmental samples. Liquid samples consisting \nof truck water (5.3 log CFU/ml) and chilled water (5.1 log CFU/ml) resulted in higher counts than (p\u22640.05) offal water \nand injector solution (4.4,4.7 log CFU/g, respectively). It is possible that the presence of indicator organisms evaluated \nvaries according to the sampling season, considering that such microorganisms have been found to have a relationship with \npathogens, E. coli  could be part of the natural microflora of the catfish ponds, thus not a good fecal indicator . \n237\n\u03c0BIOACTIVITY POTENTIAL AND DRUGLIKENESS OF  NATURAL PRODUCTS  \nFROM MARINE ORGANISMS\nMarina Pun\u010dec, Vi\u0161nja Stepani\u0107, Tomislav \u0160muc  \nRudjer Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, Croatia  \ne-mail: smuc@irb.hr\nNatural products (NP) are enourmous, still largely unexplored resource of molecules with potentially therapeutic properties. \nMore than  90 % of Earth species live in the marine environments, providing vast structural diversity and bioactivity potential \nof NPs associated with marine organisms. By investigating these organisms new compounds with applications in agriculture, \nmedicine and various biotechnological processes may be discovered. While  plants  and  terrestrial  microorganisms  have  \nbeen more explored for new chemical entities so far, the increasing number of new  drug  candidates and drugs from  marine \norganisms  is showing that this resource  will be of major interest in the future. Computational approaches  offer  a  scalable, \nearly approach  for evaluating of bioactivity potential of large chemical space of natural products. We provide here a large \nscale, qualitative breakdown of properties of small molecules (less than 800 Da) stemming from different organisms and \ncompare them against current drugs and nutraceuticals. We used COCONUT [1] (natural products)  and DrugBank [2] \n(drugs and nutraceuticals) as sources of compounds, PASS software [3] to provide bioactivity estimates and Classyfire \nWEB service [4] to structuraly classify compounds. Table 1. depicts major structure-bioactivity profiles of compounds \nfrom different origins, with their rough druglikenes assessment. Using more rigorous computational (AI, machine learning \nbased) approaches we are working  to provide deeper structural-biaoctivity assessment of the compounds originating in \nmarine organisms.\n238\nDEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED COMMERCIAL FEEDS FOR COMMERCIAL NILE \nTILAPIA (Oreochromis niloticus).  A LABORATORY STUDY ON BALANCING COST, \nPERFORMANCE, AND SUSTAINABILITY\nScott Snyder*, Craig Browdy, and Tim Markey\nZeigler Bros., Inc.\n400 Gardners Station Rd.\nGardners, PA 17324\nscott.snyder@zeiglerfeed.com\nThe state of static production volume coupled with highly volatile market conditions leaves farmers with few options for \nincreasing the profitability of their businesses.  Considering that intensive aquaculture feed expenses generally account \nfor 50-70% of the total variable costs, its reduction constitutes a priority for the economical sustainability of aquaculture \noperations and a prime subject for investigation. Thus, research devoted to the development of nutritious, environmentally \nfriendly, and cost-effective diets is of utmost importance to ensure the success and sustainability of aquaculture enterprises. \nFormulated aquaculture feeds are among the most expensive animal feeds on the market.  In this 12-week study, two \ncommercial tilapia formulations were fed to Nile tilapia in an indoor RAS at the University of Idaho\u2019s Aquaculture Research \nInstitute, Moscow, ID utilizing two feeding strategies.  Fish were fed either a single feed throughout the experiment; Diet \nA (36% CP 6% Lipid), Diet B (40% CP, 10% Lipid) or switched from Diet B to Diet A after 6-weeks for finishing.  Results \nindicated that the fish fed Diet A had significantly lower daily gain and significantly higher FCR than fish fed solely Diet \nB or the treatment fish fed Diet B for 6 weeks followed by Diet A for the final six weeks.   The unit cost of Diet A is lower \nthan  Diet B, however we will discuss the impact on final profit due to the feed and production cost dif ferentials.\n239\nTHE NUTRIMO PROJECT: DEVELOPMENT OF HANDMADE DIETS FOR TILAPIA \nNUTRITION IN COMMUNITY-BASED AQUACULTURE IN CABO DELGADO, \nMOZAMBIQUE\nAmadeu Soares*, Rui Rocha, Henriques Bustani, Andreia Rodrigues, Silvia Pires\nCESAM (Center for Environmental and Marine Studies) & Dept of Biology , University of Aveiro\n3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal\nasoares@ua.pt\nThe project NutriMo (Development of handmade diets for tilapia nutrition in community-based aquaculture in Mozambique) \naims to improve the development of sustainable aquaculture in Mozambique, namely the community-based tilapia \naquaculture in inland villages of Cabo Delgado province. The overall objective is to substantially improve the community \naquaculture practiced in Mozambique inland waters, thus contributing to improving the quality of life of the villages, \nenabling the production of food in an efficient and sustainable way and reducing the levels of poverty in the villages of \nMozambique. \nDeveloping countries in Eastern Africa, like Mozambique, are overdependent on natural resources, which causes ecosystems \ndegradation. Community-based aquaculture can increase income and locally available food resources in villages with \nlimited access to animal protein. However, to ensure the success of this activity, it is extremely important to develop \nadequate diets, based on local ingredients, that can be produced at the community level. \nTilapias have a high potential to be farmed under simplified conditions due to their characteristics, such as omnivory, \nfast growth and resistance to stress and diseases. Here, an experimental diet, based on local ingredients from the North \nof Mozambique, was developed and tested against a commercial diet, in tilapia fingerlings, during 2 months. Growth \nperformance and resistance to thermal stress were evaluated. Tilapia fed with the experimental diet presented lower growth \nrates, lower DNA damage, and higher neurophysiological and antioxidant activity leading to increased oxidative stress. \nOverall, we show that the dietary inclusion of local ingredients could be viable for community-based aquaculture in earthen \nponds.240\nIMPACTO DEL SER HUMANO EN EL LANGOSTINO DE R\u00cdO Macrobrachium americanum   \nEN LAS POBLACIONES SILVESTRES DE SAN PEDRO DE LA PRESA (BCS) Y AGUAS \nBLANCAS (GRO)\nSoberanes-Yepiz, Maritza L.*, Sanchez-Villase\u00f1or, Karla; Cisneros-Geraldo, Alejandra; P\u00e9rez-Rodriguez, \nJuan Carlos; Cort\u00e9s-Jacinto, Edilmar\nCentro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste, S.C (CIBNOR), La Paz, B.C.S., M \u00e9xico \nAv. Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional  195, Playa Palo de Santa Rita Sur;  La Paz, B.C.S.\nE-mail: mar_itza_01@hotmail.com\nEl langostino de r\u00edo Macrobrachium americanum es una especie que puede alcanzar una talla de 460 g en el medio \nsilvestre, por lo que tiene una gran importancia econ\u00f3mica y ecol\u00f3gica.  Desde hace m\u00e1s de una d\u00e9cada, las especies de \nlangostino han sido explotadas por parte de pescadores ribere\u00f1os, para proveer de producto a los mercados locales o bien, \npara autoconsumo (New, 2009). El deterioro constante del h\u00e1bitat en el cual se desarrollan las especies de langostinos, \naunado con el incremento en la demanda de producto por los mercados locales, ha puesto en riesgo a las poblaciones \nnaturales de estos crust\u00e1ceos. \nPor ello, se realiz\u00f3 un estudio de conservaci\u00f3n de la especie en San Pedro de la Presa y puntos circunvecinos, Baja \nCalifornia Sur y en el poblado de aguas blancas, Municipio de Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez, Guerrero. Se llev\u00f3 a cabo por medio del \nm\u00e9todo cuantitativo para la recolecci\u00f3n de datos primarios (encuestas). La informaci\u00f3n obtenida a trav\u00e9s de las encuestas \nindic\u00f3 que la captura de M. americanum se realiza generalmente durante la temporada de lluvias, cuando tiene lugar la \nreproducci\u00f3n de la especie. No existe la aplicaci\u00f3n estricta de su reglamentaci\u00f3n en su captura, lo cual ha ocasionado un \ndescenso considerable en sus poblaciones, en ambas localidades (Fig. 1). Debido a que los vol\u00famenes de pesca durante \ncada temporada no son suficientes para el mantenimiento de las familias de los pescadores, estos tienen que realizar otras \nactividades, no se dedican exclusivamente a la pesca. Existe poca informaci\u00f3n sobre el grado de explotaci\u00f3n pesquera \nde las especies, por lo que se desconoce el estado real de las poblaciones silvestres. Se recomienda que es necesario una \nevaluaci\u00f3n permanente del recurso, con el objetivo de implementar medidas que garanticen su conservaci\u00f3n y manejo \nsustentable.\n241\nUN M\u00c9TODO SIMPLE PARA ESTIMAR EL BIENESTAR ANIMAL EN GRANJAS \nACU\u00cdCOLAS\nJos\u00e9 Axel Solano Aguileta* , Alberto Asiain Hoyos, Juan Lorenzo Reta Mendiola,  Alejandra Ram\u00edrez Mart\u00ednez, \nVer\u00f3nica Lango Reynoso, y Antonio Campos Mendoza\n*Colegio de Postgraduados - Campus Veracruz\nCarretera Xalapa-Veracruz, km 85.5 Tepetates, Manlio Fabio Altamirano, Veracruz. CP. 91690. M\u00c9XICO\nsolano.axel@colpos.mx  \nEl bienestar animal en acuacultura se relaciona generalmente con aspectos \u00e9ticos, morales y de inocuidad. El concepto de \nbienestar animal es un tema de inter\u00e9s social, que est\u00e1 poco estudiado en las cadenas de producci\u00f3n acu\u00edcolas a nivel mundial, \nprincipalmente en pa\u00edses en desarrollo, adem\u00e1s de ser un t\u00e9rmino incipiente y con varias connotaciones dependiendo de los \n\u00e1ngulos en los que se analice. El bienestar animal en la acuacultura es una caracter\u00edstica que se le adjudica a los organismos \ncon pocas o nulas experiencias negativas en las distintas fases productivas y confiere a las especies un valor agregado, pues \nla calidad del producto mejora significativamente. En la mayor\u00eda de las unidades de producci\u00f3n acu\u00edcola del sureste de \nM\u00e9xico, principalmente de tilapia y trucha, el tema de bienestar animal se sigue considerando como \u201ctab\u00fa\u201d y pr\u00e1cticamente \nno existe informaci\u00f3n sobre las percepciones de productores, comercializadores y consumidores ante este asunto. Para \ntratar de entender el estado actual del bienestar animal en la acuacultura continental del sureste de M\u00e9xico, se dise\u00f1\u00f3 un \ninstrumento para evaluarlo de una manera r\u00e1pida y objetiva. El instrumento se basa en la escala visual an\u00e1loga (EV A) \nWong-Baker FACES \u00ae, que es una escala que trabaja con intervalos. La escala toma valores de 0 a 10, que se traducen a \nuna escala num\u00e9rica de bienestar animal. Valores tendientes a 0 sugieren bajo nivel de sufrimiento para los organismos, \nmientras que valores tendientes a 10 corresponden a niveles elevados de sufrimiento. El instrumento se aplica dos etapas \nde las cadenas productivas: durante el proceso de cultivo, y durante la cosecha y sacrificio. Los criterios para asignar los \ndiferentes intervalos corresponden a las Buenas Pr\u00e1cticas de Manejo, aceptadas convencionalmente en la mayor\u00eda de los \nsistemas de certificaci\u00f3n. Resultados preliminares al utilizar este instrumento indican que la mayor\u00eda de las unidades de \nproducci\u00f3n del sureste de M\u00e9xico, principalmente las peque\u00f1as granjas y los acuacultores de recursos limitados, cultivan, \ncosechan y sacrifican los organismos sin considerar y manejar adecuadamente el bienestar animal. La capacitaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda \nayudar a revertir esta tendencia.242\nLA ACUACULTURA INTEGRADA MULTITR\u00d3FICA COMO ESTRATEGIA PARA EL \nCULTIVO EN TANQUES DE PARGO CANAN\u00c9 Ocyurus chrysurus,  EXPERIENCIAS \nPRELIMINARES\nLorena M. Sosa Basto*, Miguel A. Olvera Novoa\nCentro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN\nKm. 6 Antigua Carretera a Progreso\nCordemex, Yucat\u00e1n 97310\nlorena.sosa@cinvestav.mx\nEn la pen\u00ednsula de Yucat \u00e1n varias especies se encuentran sometidas a intensas presiones extractivas, entre las que se \nencuentra el pargo canan \u00e9 (Ocyurus chrysurus ) integrante del \u201ccomplejo rubia\u201d y de la fauna acompa \u00f1ante del mero, \nsosteniendo actualmente la pesquer \u00eda de escama en Yucat \u00e1n ante la disminuci\u00f3n en la abundancia del mero. Por esta raz\u00f3n, \nse plantea su cultivo como una alternativa para su producci\u00f3n en cautiverio, mediante la aplicaci\u00f3n de un sistema integrado \nmultitr\u00f3fico (SIM) incluyendo pepino de mar ( Isostichopus badionotus ), macroalgas ( Solieria filiformis ) y hal\u00f3fitas \n(Salicornia bigelovii, Rhizophora mangle ).\nSe realiz\u00f3 un experimento durante 10 meses utilizando un SIM en sistema cerrado recirculante con los peces como especie \nprincipal. Se sembraron en un tanque de 1 m3 54 juveniles de pargo canan \u00e9 con un peso promedio inicial de 37.53 g. Fueron \nalimentados ad libitum con alimento de engorda para pargo (Skretting Marine MX\u00ae; Tootle, UT, USA). El peso de los \norganismos se registr\u00f3 cada mes. \nA los 10 meses se obtuvo una supervivencia del 96%, donde el 67% de los organismos alcanz\u00f3 al menos 400 g de peso \nm\u00ednimo, indicando elevado potencial para cultivos comerciales.\nEl cultivo de pepino de mar se dividio en dos etapas. En la primera se evalu\u00f3 por triplicado la densidad de 14 juveniles \npor m3 en tanques de fibra de vidrio acoplados al SIM. Se alimentaron con una mezcla 1:1:1 de macroalgas ( Ulva sp., \nSargassum sp., Macrocystis sp.). Debido a las altas tasas de mortalidad, en una segunda etapa se redujo la densidad a 10 \njuveniles por m3 y se enriqueci\u00f3 la alimentaci\u00f3n con microdietas. Al final de esta etapa la supervivencia fue del 100% \ndemostrando que I. badionotus tiene un elevado potencial para su cultivo en tanques en un SIM. \nEl efecto de  las macroalgas ( S. filiformis ) y hal\u00f3fitas ( Salicornia  bigelovii, Rizophora mangle ) en la concentraci \u00f3n de \nmetabolitos disueltos en el agua se evalu \u00f3 mediante el c \u00e1lculo de la tasa de retenci \u00f3n (TR), para lo cual se llev\u00f3 un registro \nde la concentraci\u00f3n de NH4, NO2, NO3 y PO43 en diversos puntos del sistema.\nS. filiformis  y S. bigelovii  resultaron adecuados como filtros biol \u00f3gicos, reteniendo cantidades significativas de ortofosfatos \ny metabolitos nitrogenados (NH4 y NO3) disueltos en el agua, manteniendo niveles adecuados para el crecimiento y \nsupervivencia de los peces y los pepinos de mar.\nSe concluye que el cultivo de pargo canan \u00e9, pepino de mar,  macroalgas y plantas hal \u00f3fitas en sistemas integrados \nmultitr \u00f3ficos, es una alternativa factible para la producci \u00f3n acu \u00edcola sustentable de estos organismos, siendo \u00e9ste el primer \nreporte de cultivo de O. chrysurus  en tanques en tierra firme. 243\nFORMULACI\u00d3N DE CONCENTRADOS PROTEICOS A PARTIR DE SUBPRODUCTOS \nPARA NUTRICI\u00d3N ACU\u00cdCOLA \nLaura Bel\u00e9n Soto Pe\u00f1a*, Hervey Rodr\u00edguez Gonz\u00e1lez, Emmanuel Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1o\nInstituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Centro Interdisciplinario De Investigaci\u00f3n Para El Desarrollo Integral Regional \nUnidad Sinaloa (CIIDIR-SIN), Guasave, Sinaloa, M\u00e9xico, 81101\nlsotop2200@alumno.ipn.mx\nINTRODUCCI\u00d3N: La industria acu\u00edcola utiliza, en su mayor\u00eda, alimentos de origen animal como lo es la harina de \npescado. Sin embargo, el alimento comercial representa alrededor del 50% de costo total de producci\u00f3n. Para reducir dicho \ncosto es importante buscar alternativas sostenibles con subproductos para sustituir la harina de pescado (Faillace et al., \n2016). METODOLOG\u00cdA: Se elaboraron concentrados proteicos a partir de subproductos de origen vegetal y animal por \nextracci\u00f3n y precipitaci\u00f3n de prote\u00ednas. Se formularon dietas isoproteicas para sustituir 7.5% y 15% la harina de pescado \ncon los concentrados proteicos.

Often as well the role \nof aquaculture planning and better management of production have not been acknowledged as a relevant first step towards \nadaptation. However, many types of impacts could cause effects whose magnitude would be farm-density dependent.\nFollowing the IPCC risk framework h ere we examine the existence/implementation of  a process to address and reduce \nrisks including : Information and climatic projections, assessing risks, reduce risks through best adaptation options and,  \nthe role of non-regrets actions  such as better planning and management. This was done by an analysis of more than 400 \npublished papers and reports on the topic during the past 10 years.  We also used 2 case studies from Chile; salmon farming \nand mussel farming.\nAlthough the understanding about climate change impacts on the sector is increasing worldwide, in most cases, especially \nin developing countries,  the lack of spatially and temporally relevant climate change risk assessment may be an obstacle \nto more targeted adaptation. Only about 8% of the publications involve field risk assessments leading to specific adaptation \nmeasures. Within this set of publications those dealing specifically with better planning and improved management as non-\nregret actions represents 5%.  \nChilean aquaculture is globally prominent by its salmon and mussel production. Both sectors are expose to climate \nchange and a national research initiative, ARCLIM, allowed to develop risk maps that showed areas at higher risk due \nto an increasing drought which will reduce freshwater inputs to fjords and coastal zones which may increase diseases in \nsalmon and HABs affecting both. The assessment allowed to examine ways to reduce risks including spatially reallocating \nproduction to reduce both sensitivity and exposure in certain areas. In the case of mussel farming the collection of wild \nspats may be at high risk and the risk reduction measures involved better management of parental mussel beds as well as \nbetter management and spatial allocation of collection systems.\nThe analysis of the literature and the case studies allow to underscore the need to understand the role of better planning and \nmanagement as non-regret actions and  first steps towards adaptation. They are also actions that give more responsibility \nand ownership of the adaptation process to farmers.245\nMORPHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT IN CULTURED BARRED SAND BASS  Paralabrax \nnebulifer LARV AE\nImelda Soto-Andrade*, Jos\u00e9 L.

Playa Palo de Santa Rita, 23096, La Paz, Baja California Sur, M\u00e9xico\nE-mail: isotoa2000@alumno.ipn.mx\nThe study of the early life phases of marine fish allows us to know the morphological changes that occur throughout \ndevelopment and make it possible to improve biotechnologies for culturing species of interest. The barred sand bass \nParalabrax nebulifer  is the most important small-scale commercial fishery along the Pacific coast of Baja California, \nMexico making is a considerable species with aquacultural potential. The aim of this work is to contribute to the recognition \nof main morphological changes during larval development until transformation to juvenile of barred sand bass, through the \ndescription of morphometry, meristic, pigmentation and squamation patterns. \nDuring culture, the larvae were fed for 32 days on three diets (rotifers, Artemia  nauplii, and microdiets). For the morphometric \ndescription, the phases of ontogenetic development were divided into apterolarval phase, pterolarval phase and juvenile, \nbased on the criteria of saltatory ontogeny. The conventional measurements were taken from 219 specimens, corresponding \nto 112 apterolarval phase, 88 pterolarval phase, and 19 juveniles. To detect allometric growth, the morphometric relationships \nof each developmental phase were used by the growth coefficient. A series of developments was revealed for the study of \nmeristics. The meristic, pigmentation and squamation patterns were outlined. As for results, the following developmental \nphases were observed: apterolarval phase, from 1.82-3.79 mm notochordal length (NL) (3-19 days post hatching [DPH]); \npterolarval phase (10-25 DPH), with the presence of fin primordia from 3.80-8.05 mm NL; juveniles (23-30 DPH), with \nfull finray complement from 8.06-11.27 mm standard length (SL). The growth of the body parts analyzed throughout the \ndevelopment of the apterolarval phase to the juvenile, behaved with positive or negative allometry, except in the case of \nthe depth of the body, since isometry is present in the apterolarva phase. In the meristic study, it was observed that from \nthe pterolarval phase, the presence of the fin elements were detected starting at 5.05 mm NL, along with the anal fin \nspine and the vertebral centers; later the rest of the fins were completed, until completing the count in 8.06 mm SL in the \njuvenile. In addition, the pigmentation and squamation patterns are described until transformation to juvenile. Finally, a \nfeeding schedule from larval development to juvenile of barred sand bass based on their morphological changes is proposed  \n(figure 1). \n246\nBIOPROSPECTING PELOIDS \u2013THE BORDERLINE BETWEEN LAND AND AQUATIC \nENVIRONMENT \nAntonio Starcevic*, Denis Vadlja, Maro Bujak, Rozelindra \u010co\u017e-Rakovac , Marin Roje, Lara \u010ci\u017emek , \nAnita Horvati\u0107, Ema Svetli\u010di\u0107, Janko Dimini\u0107, Sa\u0161a Rakovac, Damir Oros, Jurica Zucko\nFaculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology part of the Center of excellence for Marine Bioprospecting \u2013 \nBioProCro, Pierottijeva 6, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia\nE-mail: astar@pbf.hr\nSeawater is an environment in which numerous organisms evolve, some with great potential for biotechnology. In recent \nyears, however, many scientists have moved away from the assumption that the origin of life was in pools of water, and \ninstead propose life on Earth probably originated in accumulations of warm, nutrient-rich mud. This mud, also called a \npeloid, has formed over many years through various processes and is a rich source of living organisms that, due to their \nadaptation to this unique environment, produce a wide variety of primary and secondary metabolites with numerous and \ndiverse activities, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulatory ones. \nThis research aimed to characterize both prokaryotic and eukaryotic contribution to peloid. It also reports the living \nmicroorganism part of the peloid attributed healing properties by screening for bioactive compounds produced by \nmicroorganisms making up the peloid ecosystem. This was accomplished by high-throughput mass spectrometry coupled \nwith bioinformatics pipeline based on DEREPLICATOR+ (Mohimani, H. et al. 2018) allowing for screening of thousands \nof available natural products from COCONUT database (Sorokina et al. 2021).\nThe results of research have been accepted for publication in Frontiers in Marine Science, under the title: \u201cBioprospecting \nfor microorganisms in peloids - extreme environment known for its healing properties\u201d by Vadlja et al. 2022.\n247\nBACTERIOPHAGE BASED CONTROL OF VIBRIOSIS IN AQUACULTURE\nC.R.Subhashini\nAristogene Biosciences Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, India\nemail: subhashini@aristogene.com\nThe shrimp industry ranks as the highest foreign exchange earner among our marine product exports. Asian countries \nlike Indonesia, Thailand and India have emerged as global leaders in shrimp production. Aquaculture is the most rapidly \nexpanding sector in food production, yet the most vulnerable to losses caused by disease.   Among the groups of pathogenic \nmicroorganisms, vibriosis is the well-known cause of severe economic losses and responsible for massive mortality of \ncultured shrimp, fish and shellfish. An intensive mode of culture with high stocking density has resulted in increase in \nthe incidence of diseases.  To maintain productivity of such intensive aquaculture massive use of antibiotics has been \nemployed. The spread of antibiotic resistance from aquaculture settings to the natural environment is increasing.  About \n70% of the Vibrio isolated from aquaculture settings is multi-drug resistant.  \nAnother concern associated with the use of antibiotics is the problem of residues, which has resulted in rejection by \nseafood importing countries of shrimp containing traces of antibiotics. Alternative strategies must be developed to control \ndiseases in aquaculture. These strategies should reduce the risk of developing and spreading microbial resistance and more \nenvironment friendly.\nToday, unless concerted action is taken to curb antibiotic overuse and misuse, in humans and animals, the world may be \nheading for a post-antibiotic age.\nBacteriophage Therapy\nBacteriophage therapy is currently considered as a viable alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections \nin aquaculture systems. The use of bacteriophages to control bacterial infections in aquatic food production system has the \npromising potential to address the twin problem of controlling bacterial infections and at the same time avoiding residue \ncontamination. \nThe application of phages in aquaculture has good advantages over the use of antibiotics.  \n\u2022  This includes the targeted attack of vibrios by phages, phages are abundant in nature, no serious side effect; On the \ncontrary, antibiotics target both pathogen and normal micro-flora, which have multiple side effects; \n\u2022  Self-replicating therapeutic \n\u2022  Self-limiting -Phages thrive in the presence of bacteria and die out in their absence.\n\u2022  \u201cGreen Natural Alternative\u201d to antibiotics\n\u2022  No damage to normal (beneficial) flora\nThe present study is aimed at assessing the potential advantages of using bacteriophages against vibrios in shrimp culture.  \nField Trials:  \n\u2022  Several Field trials showed that the larval survivability in the hatcheries increased markedly with the bacteriophage \ntherapy.\n\u2022  Use of phage therapy in grow-out culture:  Phage cocktail against vibriosis was also mixed with feed and fed to animals \nwhich showed that there is a decrease in the vibrio counts in the gut of animals, decrease in running mortality, White \nfaecal disease, increase in survival and increase in Average daily weight gain.\n\u2022  Bacteriophage-based formulation against vibrios resulted in better growth, survival, FCR and quality of marine shrimp \nPenaeus Vannamei .\n\u2022  The trials have demonstrated the potential of vibrio-specific phages to significantly reduce the impacts of vibrios, \nwith a resulting positive effect on shrimp survival.  Therefore, phage therapy may be a realistic alternative approach \nfor controlling pathogenic bacteria in aquaculture owing to its several advantages over the conventional antibiotics \nand other methods against pathogenic multiple drug resistant (MDR) bacteria.248\nCARACTERIZACI\u00d3N DE EXTRACTOS LIP\u00cdDICOS DERIV ADOS DE SUBPRODUCTOS  \nDE CABEZA DE CAMAR\u00d3N OBTENIDOS MEDIANTE LA TECNOLOG\u00cdA DE \nULTRASONIDO\nLBG.

La acuacultura de crust\u00e1ceos es el sector de producci\u00f3n de productos del mar m\u00e1s grande del mundo y \nproporciona un suministro de alimentos ricos en prote\u00ednas. Los camarones y sus productos se consumen ampliamente \nen todo el mundo y su demanda aumenta cada a\u00f1o debido a su delicadeza y valor nutricional. La producci\u00f3n mundial de \ncamar\u00f3n llega a los 5,03 millones de toneladas en 2020 y se espera que aumente hasta los 7,28 millones de toneladas para \n2025 con una tasa de crecimiento anual compuesta del 6,1% de 2020 a 2025 .\nGeneralmente, los camarones una vez de ser capturados de su h\u00e1bitat se almacenan y en ocasiones se exportan congelados con \no sin c\u00e1scara, dependiendo de la demanda del mercado. Por lo tanto, durante el procesamiento del camar\u00f3n, aproximadamente \ndel 50 al 60% de los subproductos del procesamiento del camar\u00f3n (Senphan y Benjakul, 2012). Adem\u00e1s, el proceso de \nlavado y cocci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n genera contaminaci\u00f3n de aguas residuales , alrededor de 1 gal\u00f3n por toneladas de camar\u00f3n cocido \n(Nirmal y col., 2020). Este subproducto constituye alrededor del 45-50% de la captura y causa contaminaci\u00f3n ambiental \ny problemas de eliminaci\u00f3n debido a descargas no reguladas (Sila y col., 2015). Una peque\u00f1a cantidad de desechos de \ncamar\u00f3n se utiliza como alimento para animales y como ingrediente en la formulaci\u00f3n de alimentos para la acuacultura. \nSin embargo, se est\u00e1n desperdiciando grandes cantidades de este subproducto y a su vez generando un aumento en la \ncontaminaci\u00f3n ambiental, lo que resulta en la p\u00e9rdida de valiosos componentes ricos en compuestos lip\u00eddicos. \nHoy en d\u00eda, la extracci\u00f3n asistida por ultrasonido (EAU) se ha utilizado para extraer l\u00edpidos del cefalot\u00f3rax de camar\u00f3n con \nun mayor rendimiento (Gulzar y Benjakul, 2018) y la EAU en condiciones \u00f3ptimas podr\u00edan ser una forma \u00fatil de extraer \nl\u00edpidos del residuo s\u00f3lido del cefalot\u00f3rax (RSC).\nDado que los RSC puede ser una fuente alternativa de l\u00edpidos, el cefalot\u00f3rax de camar\u00f3n podr\u00eda utilizarse plenamente con \nel concepto de \u201cdesperdicio cero\u201d. Para mejorar la eficacia de la extracci\u00f3n de l\u00edpidos de RSC, se podr\u00edan utilizar EAU \ncon las condiciones adecuadas. Por lo que, en esta investigaci\u00f3n, se estudia el efecto de EAU (tiempo ultras\u00f3nico) sobre el \nrendimiento de extracci\u00f3n y composici\u00f3n bioactiva de l\u00edpidos de RSC de camar\u00f3n blanco del Pac\u00edfico. \nObjetivo general.  Evaluar y caracterizar el rendimiento de extractos lip\u00eddicos derivados de subproductos de cabeza de \ncamar\u00f3n obtenidos mediante la tecnolog\u00eda de ultrasonido..\nEstrategia metodol\u00f3gica.  Para el estudio, se propuso una estrategia experimental dividida en tres etapas.\nEn la primera etapa se estudi\u00f3 el efecto del tiempo (0-50 min) en la EAU sobre el rendimiento de extracci\u00f3n de l\u00edpidos a \ndiferentes relaciones de muestra/solvente (1:2, 1:4). Los resultados obtenidos, \n(Continued on next page)\n249\nindicaron que el mayor rendimiento (8.88 g de l\u00edpido/100 g de RSC) se pod\u00eda encontrar a los 20 min en una relaci\u00f3n \nmuestra / solvente 1:4. La segunda etapa del estudio consisti\u00f3 en determinar el contenido total de carotenoides (CTC) de \nlos extractos lip\u00eddicos obtenidos en la etapa anterior. Los resultados obtenidos, indicaron que el m\u00e1ximo rendimiento (8.25 \nmg de carotenoides/g l\u00edpido) del CTC se encontr\u00f3 a los 20 min en una relaci\u00f3n muestra/solvente 1:4. \nFinalmente, con el objetivo de evaluar los compuestos asociados a los extractos lip\u00eddicos obtenidos de los RSC provenientes \nde subproductos de camar\u00f3n, se evalu\u00f3 el contenido total de fen\u00f3licos y capacidad antioxidante. Los resultados obtenidos \nmostraron que el mayor rendimiento de ambas variables de respuesta medidas se encontr\u00f3 generalmente a los 20 min en \nuna relaci\u00f3n muestra/solvente 1:4. Por lo tanto, la EAU con las condiciones adecuadas (20 min en una relaci\u00f3n muestra/\nsolvente 1:4) podr\u00edan usarse como un m\u00e9todo potencial para la extracci\u00f3n de l\u00edpidos de los RSC. \nReferencias. \nGulzar, S., & Benjakul, S.

In this study the ossification process of C. estor  was evaluated in specimens under culture conditions. Results \nshow that the ossification of the first skeletal structures begin between 30 to 45 days after hatching (dah), and the process \nconcludes between 60 to 100 dah. Therefore, the first two months of life of the species must be closely supervised, since the \nossification process is highly susceptible to the influence of biotic, abiotic, and physicochemical factors that may produce \nskeletal deformities.\nFor this study, the double staining protocol (Darias et al., 2010) was used. Incubation times and temperatures were adjusted \naccordingly to fish size and morphological characteristics, to achieve optimal stain of cartilaginous and bony tissues.\nFish were obtained from the hatchery at the Instituto de Investigaciones Forestales y Agropecuarias (IIAF), Universidad \nMichoacana de San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo (UMSNH).\nFifteen fish were sampled from the following intervals of age: 10 to 30, 30 to 45, 45 to 60 and 60 to 100 days after hatching \n(dah). Fish were fed according to the protocol described by Mart\u00ednez-Palacios et al. (2002). For newly hatched larvae, the \nphotoperiod applied was 24 h light: 0 h dark. For larvae since 10 dah and juveniles, natural photoperiod (12L:12D) was \napplied.\nThe total body length for each of the four sampled groups of age was the following: \n251\nGREEN ORMER ( Haliotis tuberculata ) TISSUE RESPONSES TO SEASONAL V ARIATIONS \nIN THE NORTHERN ADRIATIC SEA\nN.

A low average depth of 30 m, and a weak \nbathymetric gradient characterizes the Northern Adriatic. The most important oceanographic factors in the Adriatic are \nseasonal salinity, the concentration of nutrients, light intensity, currents and temperature. Seasonal changes of oceanographic \nfactors, including temperature, algae and wave motion, greatly affect the growth and physiology of green ormers. For this \nreason, the Northern Adriatic green ormer tissues were studied over the main seasonal periods for their microanatomical \nstructure, biochemical and antioxidant defense properties. \nTissue concentrations of glucose (GLU), triglyceride (TRIG) and cholesterol (CHOL) were determined as the main \nenergy sources for metabolic demands. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total \nantioxidant status (TAS) were evaluated as parameters for antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation. Tissue magnesium \n(Mg) and calcium (Ca) were investigated as formative shell elements, crucial for ionic homeostasis and reproduction \ncontrol. Significant differences were found between spring/summer and winter samples for TAS, with peaks in June. GPx \nhad the highest activities in fall samples, just as SOD, CHOL, GLU, TRIG, Mg and Ca parameters. Differences in green \normer tissue biochemical and antioxidant defense properties over seasons are shown in the figure as a log10-based scale. \nData were grouped tightly in ormer tissues in spring/summer and winter, having unsymmetrical interquartile ranges. Long-\nterm temperatures between 8.5 and 9.0\u00b0C are the lethal limit for ormers, and at low temperatures, they are limited in their \nability to absorb food and grow. Winter low temperatures thus contributed to lower TAS and SOD concentrations. Not only \nantioxidant capacity, but also tissue Mg, Ca and GLU were on the decreased levels in ormers in winter. However, in fall \na number of parameters had their yearly peaks, such as Mg, Ca, SOD, GPx, TRIG, CHOL and GLU. Interestingly, in this \nwork ormers had elevated total antioxidant status in the warmer period, which can be attributed to the availability of food \ncontaining antioxidant compounds. During the spring/summer season, gonads were at the mid-maturation stage, and in fall, \nthe ripe and spawned stages were recorded.\n252\nDISTRIBUTION OF MARINE MUSSELS SPECIES OF THE GENUS  Mytilus ALONG THE \nCHILEAN COAST\nJorge E.

The M. chilensis  \naquaculture began in 1943 in Chilo\u00e9 Island, southern Chile, and the aquaculture production increased rapidly from 3,864 \nt in 1993 to 398,274 t in 2018, equivalent of 29,3% of the total Chilean aquaculture production. Therefore, and because \nthe relative recent description of two species of mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis and Mytilus edulis in chilean waters, \nthere is a need to carry out a surveys to establish the actual distribution of these two exotic mussels along the Chilean coast \nand evaluate their actual and potential effects on the biodiversity along the coast and on the fasting growing mussel ( M. \nchilensis ) aquaculture industry. Once the evidence that these mussel species arrived to a coastal location it is important \nto study their distribution and urgently to investigate their origin and its potential for bioinvasion along the chilean coast.\nSamples of 30 adult mussels from 36  locations along almost 2,500 km of Chilean coast were analyzed using two nuclear \nmarkers ( Me 15-16 and Myti ) and two mitochondrial markers ( 16S and COIXba ). The results indicate that from the 1030 \nmussels analyzed 76% belongs to the Chilean native M. chilensis ; 17% to the mediterranean mussel M galloprovincialis , \n4% to the northern hemisphere M. edulis  and only 2% to hybrids between these species of mussels. The highest number \nof hybrids were detected between M. edulis  and  the native mussel M. chilensis . Also samples of cultured mussels from \n8 aquaculture production centers were analyzed, within the X Region (southern Chile), where over 95% of the Chilean \nmussel aquaculture production is obtained.  Among these mussel aquaculture centers, the results indicated that 96% of the \nmussels were the native Chilean mussel M. chilensis , 3% M. galloprovincialis  and 1% of hybrids. Interesting is that among \nthese hybrids, there were Mytilus trossulus  alleles detected (a mussel species that inhabits the cold waters in the northern \nhemisphere), as described earlier by other authors. Also a high plastic variability among mussels shell (different morphology \nand coloration) within pure species was observed which precludes the use of these phenotypic traits in taxonomy. Two of \nthe mussels detected can be detrimental for the chilean mussel aquaculture. M. galloprovincialis  has been declared one of \nthe world \u00b4s 100 worst invasive species and M. trossulus have lower rates of somatic tissue and shell weight. \nResearch founded by FONDECYT 1170194.  253\nREPLACEMENT OF FISH MEAL BY ANTARCTIC KRILL MEAL IN DIETS FOR \nEUROPEAN SEA BASS Dicentrarchus labrax : EFFECTS ON GROWTH PERFORMANCE, \nFEED UTIZATION AND LIVER METABOLISM \nSilvia Torrecillas*, Daniel Montero1, Marta Carvalho1, Tibiabin Benitez-Santana2 and Marisol Izquierdo\nGrupo de Investigaci\u00f3n en Acuicultura (GIA), IU-ECOAQUA, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria \nCrta. Taliarte s/n, Telde, Las Palmas, Canary Islands, Spain\nsilvia.torrecillas@giaqua.org\nA sustainable growth of the aquaculture sector implies the use of sustainable novel raw materials as replacers of the \ntraditional fishmeal (FM) and fish oil (FO) ingredients. This fact has led to the development of sustainable and functional \ndiets as part of a management strategy to reduce the effects on fish growth performance and health derived from low \nFM/FO dietary contents. In this sense, Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ) is considered a potential candidate in dietary \ninclusions to potentiate fish growth and health status. \nIn this study, European sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) were fed a practical diet with either a 15% fishmeal content (KM0; \ncontrol diet) or the same diet substituted by 30% (KM5; 50 g KM/kg diet) or 50% (KM7.5; 75g KM/kg diet) Antarctic \nkrill meal (KM) for 12 weeks in triplicates. At the end of the feeding trial, growth performance, liver morphology, liver \nproximate composition, lipid classes and fatty acid profiles, as well as the expression of hepatic genes related with lipid \nmetabolism were evaluated. \nFish fed KM-based diets presented higher (p<0.05) final weight, protein and lipid efficiency ratios, specific growth rate \n(SGR) and improved feed conversion ratio (FCR), irrespective of the KM dietary level. Whole body and muscle proximate \ncomposition and fatty acid profiles were similar among dietary groups. Livers of European sea bass fed the experimental \ndiets presented similar (p>0.05) biochemical composition and fatty acid profile. However, smaller hepatocellular area and \nlower grade of cytoplasm vacuolization as well as a better alignment around sinusoidal spaces were found. The analyses \nof liver lipid classes revealed a positive correlation between the level of dietary KM and the pigmented material such \nas astaxanthin and free fatty acid content, as well as a negative correlation with the cholesterol levels.  The expression \nof hepatic genes studied demonstrated a downregulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (hmgr)  \nand delta-6-desaturase ( fads2 ) expression levels in fish fed KM-based diets. Besides, gene expression levels of fatty acid \nbinding protein 7 ( fabp7 ) and lipoprotein lipase ( lpl) were significantly correlated with KM dietary levels. Altogether, these \nresults profile KM as a potential promoter of growth and liver health in European sea bass fed low fish meal and oil diets. 254\nPROINMUNOIL PLUS: FUNCTIONAL FEED ADDITIVES IN LOW FISH MEAL AND \nFISH OIL-BASED DIETS FOR EUROPEAN SEA BASS Dicentrarchus labrax : EFFECTS ON \nMUCOSAL HEALTH\nSilvia Torrecillas*, Marisol Izquierdo, F\u00e9lix Acosta, Genciana Terova and Daniel Montero \nGrupo de Investigaci\u00f3n en Acuicultura (GIA), IU-ECOAQUA, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria\nCrta. Taliarte s/n, Telde, Las Palmas, Canary Islands, Spain\nsilvia.torrecillas@giaqua.org\nAn effective replacement for fish meal (FM) and fish oil (FO) based on plant-based raw materials in the feed of marine \nfish species is necessary for the sustainability of the aquaculture sector. One of the main objectives of PROINMUNOIL \nPLUS project was to promote European sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) mucosal health through the use of feed additives \nin low FM and FO diets. To achieve this objective, the effect of several feed additives included in low fish meal (10%FM) \nand fish oil (6%FO)-based diets, on gill and gut mucosal health as well as in disease and stress resistance of European sea \nbass were evaluated through a series of experiments. Three experimental diets were tested along PROINMUNOIL PLUS \nproject, one was void of the test ingredients (control diet), while the remaining two contained 5,000 ppm of galactomannan \noligosaccharides (GMOS; Delacon, Austria) and 200 ppm of a blend of garlic and labiatae-plant oils (PHYTO; Delacon, \nAustria), respectively. Diets were supplemented for 63 days before exposing the fish to an intestinal Vibrio anguillarum  \ninfection combined with crowding stress. In order to evaluate functional diets efficacy in mucosal health maintenance, \nstructural, cellular, and immune mucosal tissues status were evaluated by optical and electron microscopy, gene expression \nand microbiota analyses. \nThe main results of the project concluded the specific role of each additive in maintaining mucosal health or promoting \ndisease or stress resistance for this species. Even more, the effects detected were not only tissue specific but also region \nspecific within the same tissue. Feeding with functional diets did not affect growth performance; however, feed additives \nreduced European sea bass susceptibility to V . anguillarum and acute stress cortisol levels. Functional additives did not \naffect gut folds morphometry but reduced the posterior gut fold area covered by goblet cells. PHYTO reduced posterior \ngut goblet cell size and increased rodlet cell density, whereas dietary GMOS reduced submucosal thickness and increased \nrodlet cell density in rectum. Structural TEM analyses revealed increased rectum microvilli length after feeding GMOS, \nwhereas the use of PHYTO increased Ocln , N-Cad and Cad-17  posterior gut gene expression. In terms of microbiota \npopulations, the main beneficial effects of dietary GMOS and PHYTO were the reduction of coliforms and Vibrionales \nbacteria and the enrichment of gut microbiota composition with butyrate producer taxa. In gills, GMOS and PHYTO \ndownregulated the expression of sod, gpx, cat and gr compared to gills of fish fed the control diet. The morphological, \nhistopathological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical parameters of the fish gills were mostly unaffected by GMOS \nand PHYTO. However, the PHYTO group the lowest incidence of lamellar fusion, whereas GMOS reduced gill goblet cell \nsize. Both additives significantly reduced the concentration of PCNA+ cells in gills epithelia. 255\nREFUGE PREFERENCE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH GROWTH AND SURVIV AL \nRATES OF JUVENILE Octopus maya  IN CULTURE\nJessica Torres*, Pedro Gallardo, Guillermina Alcar\u00e1z, Carlos Rosas & Karla Kruesi\nUnidad Multidisciplinaria de docencia e investigaci\u00f3n \u2013 Sisal\nFacultad de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico\n* jessju@ciencias.unam.mx\nThe Octopus maya  octopus is endemic to the Yucatan \nPeninsula and is one of the most important fishing \nresources in the area. At the UMDI Sisal of the UNAM \n(Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico) various aspects of the species aimed \nat its cultivation have been investigated. Octopuses are \nsolitary animals that shelter in shelters mainly to avoid \nbeing preyed upon. In this study, the preference of O. \nmaya  juveniles for a refuge was evaluated, a preference \nranking was carried out and in a second bioassay growth \nand survival were evaluated by comparing the preferred \nrefuge and the least chosen refuge.\nPost-hatching of Octopus maya  from a single spawning \nwere used. In experiment 1, an individual was placed \nin the center of an experimental arena containing five \ndifferent types of shelters (gastropod shell, artificial raffia \ngrass, PVC tube, PVC elbow, and artificial cave) of two \ndifferent sizes. After 24 h, the refuge in which the octopus \nwas found was recorded and this was the preferred \nrefuge. The selected shelter was removed from the arena \nand the octopus was later placed back in the center of \nthe experimental arena for 24 h for a new choice. The \nsame procedure was performed to determine an order of \npreference.\nIn experiment 2, the growth and survival rates of octopuses \nkept under two different treatments were compared: \noctopuses with their preferred refuge and octopuses last \nselected refuge.\nThe octopuses chose PVC tube as their preferred shelter, while they chose raffia artificial grass as the last option (Tabla 1).\nIn the 2nd bioassay, a similar growth rate was obtained (average 3.5% day-1) (p>0.05).\nSurvival at day 16 was greater in the raffia treatment (65.5%) than in the PVC tube treatment (18%). However, the statistical \nanalysis showed that there is no relationship between the refuges and the survival of the individuals. Regarding growth, no \ndifferences were observed between the two treatments (p>0.05).\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was carried out with the support of the DGAPA-UNAM, Project PAPIIT IT 201621 under the responsibility of \nDr. Pedro Gallardo\n256\nECTOPARASITES IN  Seriola rivoliana PRODUCTION IN THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA: \nCHALLENGES AND AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY\nAna G. Trasvi\u00f1a Moreno*, Sergio Maciel Zapata and Alejandro Ysla Guzm\u00e1n\n*Centro de Investigaciones en Maricultura Sustentable, CIMAS\nDelfines 225, La Paz, B.C.S. M\u00e9xico, C.P.23094\nEmail: ana.trasvina@kampachi.mx\nMariculture of  Seriola rivoliana  in the Gulf of California, M\u00e9xico is subject, like other marine finfish species, to parasitic \ninfestations. Managing them is a central issue for health and welfare. The main parasite species affecting S. rivoliana\u2019 s  \ngrowth cycle is Neobendenia spp. The Gulf of California is a natural habitat of S. rivoliana and is therefore ideal for \nits production. However, given the large number of native fish species in the area (about 911 documented species) the \nprobability of encountering parasite vectors is correspondingly high. In the specific case of Neobenedenia  spp, it has been \nreported to infect about 100 species of 30 different families, and 5 different orders of fish in the world. For this reason, total \nprevention of parasitic infestations in this circumstance is practically impossible. Moreover, Neobenedenia  spp is a parasite \nwith a direct life cycle. The adult affixes to its host and lays filamentous eggs into the water. These hatch into ciliated \nlarvae (oncomiracidia) that can re-infect rapidly the same host, and the filaments of the eggs allow them to entangle to any \navailable surface. Typical management methods used to control monogeneans parasites infecting fish are freshwater baths, \noral administration of the anthelmintic praziquantel, and hydrogen peroxide or formalin baths. In this work we present \nresults of different treatments applied in the course of two and half years. We also evaluate different management strategies \nfor the specific conditions of our production site. The main goal is to determinate the best strategy that will balance animal \nwelfare, certification standards, production costs and also minimizing environmental impact. We share the challenges and \nareas of opportunity that we have identified throughout this process.257\nFUNCTIONAL GROWER SHRIMP FEED IN ECUADOR AND MEXICO INCREASED \nSURVIV AL IN  Litopenaeus vannamei DURING 2020 \u2013 2021\nJos\u00e9 Troncoso*, Jes\u00fas Venero, Fernando Carofilis, Roberto Bravo, Jos\u00e9 Mario Vargas and Osvaldo Anaya\nCargill \nEcuador, Latam North\nJose_troncoso@cargill.com \nEnteric disease in whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei  are presenting during the whole year and distributed worldwide, \nespecially in Ecuador and Mexico shrimp farming facilities. Generic pathogen Vibrio  spp. can cause mortality and poor \nperformance of farmed shrimp, affecting economically shrimp industry. Although there is not an economical estimate only \nfor bacterial diseases, in general the impact of diseases caused in the industry is estimated in about 22% production losses \nannually (Flegel et al., 2008). \nCargill developed a functional feed concept called SmartShield to tackle enteric diseases in L. vannamei  for starters \nfeeds which is commercialized in both countries, Ecuador and Mexico since 2019. Latest developments of postbiotics \nand phytogenics brought a new SmartShield concept for grower feeds which was assessed commercially with strategic \ncustomers between 2020-2021.\nThe blend of additives has a total inclusion level of 6.0% in feed and in is based in a high nutritional density feed. This feed \nwas assessed in Ecuador and Mexico in field trials with records of bacterial diseases during different cycles of production. \nFirst trial was performed in Ecuador, where shrimps were allocated in 13 ponds (~10 Ha/pond) with a stocking density of \n15 shrimp/m2, distributed in 7 ponds for regular feed and 6 ponds for SmartShield feed. Shrimps were fed with regular and \nfunctional feeds, respectively, since 1.5 g/shrimp until 95 days before harvest.\nSecond trial was done in Mexico, in Sonora state, where shrimps were allocated in 8 ponds (5 Ha/pond) with a stocking \ndensity of 20 shrimp/m2. Each group of shrimps were fed with a regular feed or functional feed since 3 g/shrimp until 61 \ndays before harvest. \nResults showed that additional survival of animals fed with SmartShield were 5% and 8%, in Ecuador and Mexico \nrespectively, both with statistically significant differences (p<0.05). \n258\nTILAPIA LOVE MILK OF MAGNESIA:  STRONG, GENTLE SUPPLEMENT FOR CLOSED-\nLOOP AQUACULTURE SYSTEMS\nJohn Van Wingerden*\nDoug Kelley, Ph.D.\nInland Environmental Resources, Inc.\n1717 S. Rustle Street, Suite 104\nSpokane, WA 99224\nA land-based closed-loop tilapia farm in British Columbia, Canada was struggling with fish health due to insufficient pH \ncontrol and accumulation of nitrogen-based contaminants in the water system.  To address the problem the farm installed a \nmembrane bioreactor (MBR) system to maintain low levels of contaminants.  \nThey used hydrated lime (Ca(OH)2) for pH control, which was very labor intensive, caused plugging of feed lines, and did \nnot effectively control pH \u2013 especially when the fish were being fed.  As a result, nitrate levels in the water were reaching \na danger point for the fish.  In addition, they were needing to supplement with table salt (NaCl) in order to keep a healthy \nprotective slime layer on the fish bodies.\nThis study provides data on how the replacement of lime with a magnesium hydroxide-based product resulted in strong \npH control and nitrogen reduction, along with dramatic improvements in water clarity and fish health.  The nonhazardous \nliquid product, called AMALGAM-30, did not require operator maintenance, providing reliable, steady feed for optimum \npH and alkalinity control.  After three weeks of operation the nitrate levels in the water system were reduced by 89% and \nthe water clarity (turbidity) was dramatically improved.  They stopped supplementing with sodium chloride.\nPerhaps the most dramatic observation from this study was the overall improvement in the health of the fish.  The protective \nslime layer on the tilapia improved greatly when the feed of lime and table salt was replaced with AMALGAM-30, with \nnoticeably less cuts and abrasions on the fish.  The improvement in health was so noticeable that they received numerous \ncomments from buyers about the improved fish quality and dramatically improved water clarity.  As a result, the farm has \ncompletely discontinued the use of lime and salt, and has installed a permanent AMALGAM-30 storage and feed system.259\nGENETIC AND GENOMIC TOOLS FOR ABALONE SPECIES IDENTIFICATION FROM \nTHE BAJA CALIFORNIA PENINSULA\nCarmen E.

These molecular markers have been extensively used in \nspecies identification, parental assignment, characterization of genetic variability, forensic analysis, traceability, and other \napplications. However, the use of many markers for species identification can become impractical for routine applications. \nOtherwise, using a single molecular marker is not always sufficient and can sometimes lead to erroneous conclusions. In the \npresent study, we searched for the most informative SNPs that enable discrimination among six abalone species: green ( H. \nfulgens ), pink ( H. corrugata ), red ( H. rufescens ), black ( H. cracherodii ), white ( H. sorenseni ), and pinto/threaded abalone \n(H. kamtschatkana assimilis ). These abalone species inhabit the northeast (NE) Pacific coast and have high commercial and \necological importance in the Baja California peninsula, Mexico. SNP markers were identified by RADseq. Unique SNPs \nfor each species were evaluated and selected for their potential use in species assignment, as a rapid identification tool for \nroutine monitoring of fishery products. Applying these species-specific SNPs in a standardized assay permit the traceability \nof these abalone species. This assay will contribute to the management and conservation of this natural resource. Ultimately \nthis work will be patented and developed as a commercially available kit to identify abalone species from the NE Pacific \nregion. 260\nPHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF Euchuematopsis isiformis UNDER \nLABORATORY CONDITIONS: STEPS FOR SCALING UP OUTDOOR CULTURES\nRom\u00e1n Manuel V\u00e1squez-Elizondo*, Erika V\u00e1zquez-Delf\u00edn, Yolanda Freile-Pelegr\u00edn and Daniel Robledo\nLaboratorio de Ficolog\u00eda Aplicada, Cinvestav Unidad M\u00e9rida; Km 6 Antigua Carretera a Progreso\nM\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico\nroman.vazquez@cinvestav.mx\ndaniel.robledo@cinvestav.mx\nThe demand for carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide obtained from Eucheumatoids species ( Kappaphycus / Eucheuma ) \nwidely used as a food thickener, has increased in recent years. Efforts to cultivate these carrageenan-producing species in \nthe Americas have been successful in Brazil and some Caribbean islands with the introduced species K. alvarezii  (Hayashi \net al., 2017). In Mexico, Eucheumatopsis isiformis  (formerly Eucheuma isiforme ) a native species found in the southern \nGulf of Mexico and the Caribbean produces a high-quality iota carrageenan suitable to be considered a viable source \nof carrageenan with yields up to 40% of its dry weight (Freile-Pelegr\u00edn and Robledo, 2006). Under the support of the \nMARINER ARPA-e DoE program, the \u201cTropical Seaweed Farm\u201d project aims to design and develop a cultivation system \nfor large-scale production of this tropical seaweed. To achieve this, it is necessary to select and domesticate cultivars of \nE. isiformis  and basic physiological knowledge is crucial to understand the conditions for maximum growth and biomass \nproduction. In this study, morphotypes of E. isiformis  were collected from a subtidal population in Yucatan (Dzilam de Bravo) \nand acclimatized to laboratory conditions (23\u00b0C + 80 \u00b5mol quanta m-2 s-1). Physiological responses (photosynthesis and \ngrowth) were determined at different light intensities: low, LL (80 \u00b5mol quanta m-2 s-1); medium, ML (250 \u00b5mol quanta m-2 \ns-1) and high, HL (550 \u00b5mol quanta m-2 s-1). Preliminary results have shown that one to two weeks are sufficient to acclimate \nthe photosynthetic apparatus to each of the light conditions and that light levels had a strong effect on the photosynthetic \nparameters analyzed (maximum photosynthesis, respiration rates and saturation irradiance). Specimens under ML and HL \nshowed thallus elongation and development of numerous lateral branches. The results suggest that E. isiformis  is able to \ntolerate higher irradiances under cultivation conditions, up to twice its photosynthetic saturation irradiance (Ek), without \nnutrient limitation. Preliminary chemical analyses of E. isiformis  morphs revealed differences, including carrageenan \ncontent, so understanding the factors controlling their changes should be a priority. Further experiments are underway to \nextend these cultivars to outdoor conditions. \nFunding: ARPA-e DE-AR0000912 Project Cinvestav Subward 54336.\n261\nEFFECT OF METHIONINE SOURCES AND Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  CECT 5940  ON \nGROWTH PERFORMANCE OF SHRIMP FED REDUCED FISHMEAL DIETS\nOscar V .

Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico\nEmail: oscar.vazquez@evonik.com\nLimited availability of fishmeal (FM) and increasing disease pressure are two key challenges in the sustainable growth \nof shrimp farming. To successfully reduce FM, an appropriate balance of amino acids (AA) and all essential nutrients are \nrequired. Methionine (Met) is typically the first limiting AA which is commonly met with the use of supplemental Met \nsources. A dipeptide of DL-Met (DL-Methionyl-DL-Methionine) or in short \u2018Met-Met\u2019, was shown to be the most effective \nMet source for shrimps due to its very low water solubility/ leaching and better utilization. As an alternative to antibiotics, \nan in-feed probiotic based on Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  CECT 5940 (Ecobiol\u00ae) have shown to improve the health and \nperformance of shrimps. However, the combination of these strategies has not been fully explored. A trial was conducted \nto determine the effects of Met-Met and Ecobiol\u00ae on growth performance of whiteleg shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei)  fed \nreduced FM diets. A total of 480 shrimps (initial BW = 0.30 \u00b1 0.04 g) were randomly distributed to 24 tanks (150 L each) \nand fed 6 dietary treatments (4 replicates) for 54 days. Treatments in pellet form were fed 3 times per day including: D1) \npositive control diet (PC) with 20% FM and no supplemental Met, D2) reduced FM diet with 10% FM (RFM) & 0.13% \nDL-Met, D3) RFM with 0.06% Met-Met, D4) RFM with 0.19% Met-Met, D5) RFM & 0.13% DL-Met + 0.1% Ecobiol\u00ae, \nand D6) RFM with 0.06% Met-Met + 0.1% Ecobiol\u00ae. Diets were isoenergetic and to the same level of essential AA as in \nthe PC (total Lys = 2.11%). Met-Met was used with a Met bioefficacy (BE) of 200% and all diets had the same Met:Lys and \nMet+Cys:Lys ratios achieved in D1 (33 and 54% respectively) except for D4 that had a greater Met:Lys and Met+Cys:Lys \nratios (45 and 66% respectively). Data were analyzed by ANOV A and pre-planned contrast statements. Reduction of FM \nfrom 20 to 10% with an adequate balance of Met and other nutrients did not affect ( P > 0.05) any of the growth performance \nparameters (D1 vs. D2 and D3). Replacing DL-Met with 50% Met-Met (D2 and D5 vs. D3 and D6), improved final BW \nand biomass gain ( P < 0.05) and tended ( P = 0.06) to reduce FCR suggesting that the BE of Met-Met could be greater than \n200%. Increasing the Met+Cys:Lys from 44 to 66% (D3 vs. D4) resulted in numerical greater final BW and reduced FCR. \nEcobiol\u00ae supplementation (D5 and D6 vs. D2 and D3) improved ( P < 0.05) final BW and biomass gain regardless of the \nMet source used. These results demonstrate that FM levels can be reduced while maintaining an appropriate balance of AA \nand other nutrients. Increased Met+Cys:Lys resulted on improved performance and survivability. Met-Met is a superior \nMet source compared to DL-Met with a BE of at least 200% while Ecobiol\u00ae supplementation improved final BW and \nbiomass gain. Both strategies (Met-Met and Ecobiol\u00ae supplementations) added to a reduced FM diet resulted on improved \ngrowth performance compared to a diet with high FM level in shrimps. \n262\nREFERENCE POINTS FOR COMMERCIAL GROW OUT FOR RED DRUM ( S. ocellatus ) IN \nYUCATAN, MEXICO\nMiguel \u00c1ngel  Vela*\nUniversidad Marista.

Disinfection is an important and necessary tool for the management and control of diseases in aquaculture farms \ndedicated to shrimp fattening. Combination of quaternary ammonium salts (QAC) and glutaraldehyde (GLU) are two of the \nmost widely used disinfectants on shrimp\u2019s ponds to maintain low overgrowth of Vibrio  spp. The objective of the study was \nknown the in vitro residuality and sanitizing effect of an artificial challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus  in seawater using \ndifferent concentrations of a quaternary ammonium and glutaraldehyde commercial combination (QAC+GLU).\nThrough an experimental study, were compare four treatments with repetitions and measurements of the CFU/mL reduction \nat different time intervals using an artificial challenge as previously described. QAC+GLU solutions in 1L of sterile water \nwere prepared separately in Erlenmeyer flasks with different concentrations of the commercial product being the low \nconcentration 117 ppm (T1), the medium concentration 334 ppm (T2) and the high concentration 668 ppm (T3) while a \nnontreated 0 ppm (T0) was include a control. Then a pure culture of an overnight Vibrio parahaemolyticus  (VPH) strain \nSO-11 (AHPND) (donated by Dr. Ricardo S\u00e1nchez-D\u00edaz, ITSON) was collected to prepare a bacterial suspension adjusting \nits turbidity to the 0.5 McFarland scale.

For this to happened, it is crucial the increase of unused by-products. For \nthis reason, it is essential the fish oil (FO) and fish meal (FM) replacement by using protein and oil sources from recycle by-\nproducts such as terrestrial proteins and fats from husbandry animals. California yellowtail Seriola dorsalis, is a promising \nfish species to be culture. In fact, several Seriola spp.  fish species are already produced in around the world with great \nsuccess. However, being a carnivore species, a high demand of FM is needed. Therefore, the study to replace FM is crucial.\nThis study aimed to evaluate  the effect of partial to \ntotal replacement of fish meal (FM) and fish oil (FO) \nfrom diets formulated to yellowtail ( Seriola dorsalis ) \nusing poultry by-product meal (PBM) using beef \ntallow supplemented with DHA.  Four experimental \ndiets were formulated to be isoproteic and isolipidic, \nbased on the yellowtail nutritional requirements. \nCholesterol was added to compensate its content in the \nFO. S. dorsalis  juveniles (14.54g \u00b1 0.19 g, mean \u00b1 SE) \nwere randomly distributed into 12 tanks, with 500L \neach, connected into a recirculation system. After \n48 days experimentation procedure, no significant \ndifferences were observed in performance for the \nPBM in replacement of FM. Significant differences \nwere observed in the fatty acid profile of muscle tissue \namong treatments. Saturated fatty acids were less \nretained indicating a major use as energy source. It \nwas observed a lower DHA level in fish from T-Low \ncompared those from T-Med.\nIt is concluded that PBM can efficiently replace FM \nand FO in diets for  Seriola dorsalis  without any \nnegative impact.

The object of the present research was to characterize the impact of different aeration \nequipment for the intensive photoheterotrophic production of shrimp, establish the effect of a reduction in aeration time \nand characterize the impact on the physiological response of the organism. A spring-summer culture cycle was conducted \nto generate information on the continuous use of different aeration equipment on water quality, survival, food conversion \nratio and yield. A second production cycle tested the reduction of aeration from 24 to 12 hours per day. Average yields \nof 18.10 t/ha were obtained for 18.58 g shrimp. Survivals over 80% were not significantly different among treatments. \nProduction costs, gross income and net income per kilo were US$3.90, US$7.36 and US$3.45, respectively, for optimum \nsystems. A 45% reduction in final weight occurs when aeration is reduced from 24 to 12 hours per day, without statistical \ndifferences in survival (av. 81.3%). This is reflected at the physiological level in the organism where individual oxygen \nconsumption tests showed that more energy expenditure for routine metabolism is needed. It is concluded that the intensive \nphotoheterotrophic culture is a good alternative for the shrimp industry, as it allows for high yields to be obtained in limited \nspace, reduce the costs for feeding an energy for water pumping, maintaining stable culture conditions and minimizing \npotential pathogen entries to the system. 267\nA SUSTAINABLE ZERO-WATER-EXCHANGE, FULL-WATER-REUTILIZATION SYSTEM \nFOR THE INTENSIVE CULTURE OF FRESHWATER REDCLAW CRAYFISH, Cherax \nquadricarinatus\nHumberto Villarreal*, Jos\u00e9 Naranjo-P\u00e1ramo, Mayra Vargas-Mendieta, Alejandra V .

They represent the 6th most valuable aquaculture \ngroup with production over 2 million tons and an unmet demand of more than 200,000 ton/year in worldwide markets, \nincluding Asia, Europe, the U.S. and Latin-America. The Redclaw crayfish adapts to diverse culinary options for a unique \norganoleptic experience, giving it a distinct competitive advantage. The increase in crayfish demand worldwide requires \nstate-of-the-art technologies to fully incorporate new species for commercial production. The zero-water exchange, full \nwater reutilization system for the intensive culture of redclaw crayfish, is a knowledge-based technology developed over \nthe last 30 years. The photoheterotrophic culture is sustainable and bio secure, allowing for efficient feed use while self-\ncleaning organic wastes in the pond. It has been tested and validated at the commercial level, increasing yields significantly \nover traditional technologies.  \nA three phase (reproduction, nursery and grow out) 20-ha modular system produces over 200 ton of redclaw/year for \ncontinuous product delivery to the market. The modules can be replicated in locations where demand is identified. With an \ninvestment of US$4.6 million for infrastructure development (80 0.25-ha ponds), US$ 1 million for operation to first-harvest \n(month 18) and a sale price of US$15/kg, annual gross income is US$2.9 million, with production and commercialization \ncosts of US$4.5/kg and a benefit/cost of 4.3. A 10-year income statement shows: IRR= 38%, NPV= US$5.2 million, ROI= \n28 and payback time of 3.1 years.\n  268\nHYPER INTENSIVE ZERO-WATER EXCHANGE CULTURE OF WHITE SHRIMP  \nL. vannamei \nBernab\u00e9 Camacho & Humberto Villarreal*\nAquaculture Program. Northwest Biological Research Center (CIBNOR). La Paz, Baja California Sur , M\u00e9xico\ne-mail: humberto04@cibnor.mx\nShrimp production in Mexico has been increasing over the years but has been affected by diseases, cost increases, price \nvariations, the use of outdated infrastructure and obsolete technologies. This has impeded consolidation and expansion. \nTo counter this, sustainable, bio secure and economically efficient systems are needed. The photoheterotrophic culture \nis a hybrid system that mixes heterotrophic, chemotrophic and autotrophic microorganisms where a balance is struck in \nthe ecosystem between nutrients, available dissolved oxygen and a capacity for particle transportation, through aeration. \nWe have developed a three-phase hyper intensive technology for year round production of shrimp in the desert region of \nNorthwest Mexico.  \nA three phase (conditioning, nursery, grow out) 6.6 ha modular system produces 6 cycles of 18 gram shrimp and 30 ton/\nha with 60-day grow out. With an investment of US$5.8 million for infrastructure development, US$ 1.24 million for \noperation and a sale price of US$5.4/kg a benefit/cost of 1.4 is obtained. A 10-year income statement shows: IRR= 23%, \nNPV= US$3.5 million and payback time of 3.1 years.\nThe intensive photoheterotrophic culture is a good alternative for the shrimp industry, as it allows for high yields to be \nobtained.269\nBIOECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE ANNUAL INTENSIVE PRODUCTION OF PACIFIC \nWHITE SHRIMP ( Litopenaeus vannamei ) IN BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR, MEXICO\nHumberto Villarreal*, Bernab\u00e9 Camacho, Jos\u00e9 Naranjo, Mayra Vargas & Alejandra Villarreal -Garc\u00eda\n*Aquaculture Program. Northwest Biological Research Center. La Paz, Baja California Sur, M\u00e9xico\nhumberto04@cibnor.mx\nIn the future, aquaculture production will play a major role in meeting the nutritional demands of the population, contributing \nto food security worldwide. Over the last ten years, aquaculture has grown at a rate slightly over 5%/year, which is not \nenough to meet protein demands for 2050. This means that sustainable and economically viable intensified systems are \nnecessary. A high-production scenario for aquaculture will decrease seafood prices significantly (around 25%) and increase \ntheir consumption. This also requires incorporation of new production areas, as Asia generates over 90% of total output, \nwhile there is enormous potential in other regios. In Northwest Mexico, shrimp farms have been using semi-intensive \nsystems based on water exchange over the last 20 years. The industry faces severe challenges due to the presence of \ndiseases (WSSV , EMS), increases in production costs and lack of environmental sustainability.\nCIBNOR has been working with producers in Baja California Sur, a state located in the desert belt of Northwest Mexico \nwhere, production to 2013 averaged 20 tons/ha/cycle in 2 cycles/year, using 30 hp/ha of aeration and 25% water exchange. \nNevertheless, disease problems (WSSV , AHPND) have limited production since. To improve biosecurity, and reduce water \nexchange costs, we evaluated changes in water quality, annual yields and production costs in two photoheterotrophic \nrearing cycles (spring-summer, summer-fall). We then established economic viability of the production strategy. We used \nsix 1,000 m2 PVC lined ponds at Biohelis\u00ae, the Innovation and Technology Park operated by CIBNOR, with 24 h aeration, \nthat increased, depending on O2 demand, from 20 to 40 hp/ha. There was no water exchange, but filtered seawater was \nincorporated in weekly pulses, for an equivalent of less than 2%/day, to maintain water level. A 35% crude protein diet \nwas fed 2 times/day. Stocking rate was 120 Pl/m2. Spring-summer yields of L. vannamei  after 105 days reached 13,400 \n+ 233 kg/ha/cycle with a mean final weight of 13.33 + 0.35 g. Yields for the summer-fall cycle reached 17,900 + 530 kg/\nha, in 90 days. Mean final shrimp weight was 18.60 + 1.07 g. A stochastic model was fitted to the growth, mortality and \nfood conversion curves, production costs were incorporated and sale prices determined income. Economic variables and \nfinancial indicators for each cycle are presented. Implications for the consolidation of intensive shrimp culture in semiarid \nareas are discussed.270\nBROODSTOCK CONDITIONING OF PACIFIC OYSTER IN RAS: EFFECT OF THE WATER \nQUALITY, CO2-CARBONATE SYSTEM, AND  Polydora sp. \nSalvador Villasuso-Palomares*, Carmen Guadalupe Paniagua-Ch\u00e1vez\nDepartamento de acuicultura\nCentro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y de Educaci\u00f3n Superior de Ensenada (CICESE)\nCarretera Ensenada - Tijuana No. 3918, Zona Playitas, CP. 22860, Ensenada, B.C. M\u00e9xico. \nvillasuso@cicese.edu.mx\ncpaniagu@cicese.mx\nThe Pacific oyster , Magallana gigas  (formerly Crassostrea gigas ), is one of the most cultured bivalves in Mexico. \nNevertheless, the Pacific oyster production has a significant challenge: continuous seed production to meet the current \ndemand. For seed production, the hatcheries frequently use broodstock from the farming zones exposed to natural conditions \nthat cannot be controlled, like those related to the oysters\u2019 reproductive cycle or pollutants and parasites as Polydora  \nsp. This has resulted in a constant variation of oysters\u2019 condition and unpredictable time required to produce mature \norganisms. For more accurate control of the factors involved in the reproductive cycle of oysters, the use of recirculating \naquaculture systems (RAS) may be significant. Little information on the reproductive cycle on bivalves cultured in RAS \nhas been registered, especially the consideration of other interactions as the CO2-carbonate system (pH, alkalinity, CO2, \ncarbonates, bicarbonates, calcite, and aragonite) and the water quality (temperature, salinity, nitrogen compounds, and \ndissolved oxygen). Thus, this work aimed to characterize and evaluate the effect of the water quality and the CO2-carbonate \nsystem and Polydora  sp. on the reproductive cycle of M. gigas cultured in a RAS. The broodstock was conditioning in four \ndifferent temperatures (18\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, 22\u00b0C, and 24\u00b0C) for ten weeks. After the ten weeks of conditioning, the water quality \nfactors and the CO2-carbonate system were within the ranges reported as favorable for bivalves. However, no mature \norganism was observed, and high variability in the condition of the oysters was detected (Fig. 1.). The results suggest a \nnegative effect of the Polydora  sp. on the reproductive cycle of M. gigas cultured in a RAS (Fig. 2).\n271\nSUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY AQUACULTURE: OYSTER FARMING IN THE MEXICAN \nSOUTH PACIFIC.\nNicol\u00e1s Vite-Garc\u00eda*, Sa\u00fal Serrano, \u00c1ngel Cuevas, Camilo Ruiz\nEducation in the Knowledge Society PhD Programme.

The stable \nclimate that has served for the development of civilization is changing at a dizzying pace and puts all human activities at \nrisk. The risk of extreme events, sea level rise, increase in terrestrial temperature and alteration to the balances of climate \nsystems and ecosystems are already a reality throughout the planet (Bruno et al., 2018; Gattuso et al., 2018; Esper\u00f3n-\nRodr\u00edguez et al., 2019; Chapman et al., 2020).\nHowever, the rapid growth of aquaculture had led to concerns regarding its ecological sustainability. Key issues include \nconversion of ecologically critical freshwater and coastal ecosystems to farms, pollution and eutrophica-tion of aquatic \nand marine ecosystems, heightened trans-mission of parasites and pathogens, overutilization of scarce fish meal and oil \nin aquafeeds, introductions of non-native species and interbreeding of escaped aquaculture stocks with locally adapted \npopulations of wild relatives (Nie y Hallerman 2021).\nThis is because during the 50 years that aquaculture has been growing, it has done so by imitating more and more the \nintensive practices of industrialized livestock and agriculture. These intensive practices are due to the need of aquaculture \ncompanies to integrate into a market following a capitalist logic. This logic, which is basically to obtain the maximum \n(economic) benefit at the lowest cost, has brought significant profits for the owners of the companies, but has devastating \nenvironmental consequences, and does not allow local people to have a real benefit that reduces their poverty .\nUsing as a model the cultivation of native oysters in the marine portion of the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, we propose an \naquaculture based on cooperative enterprises with a horizontal structure, where human development, resource utilization, \nenvironmental care and equitable benefits are at least at the same level of priority as economic gains. Since 2000, technical \nand biological feasibility studies have been carried out in the region, it is necessary to develop an education and training \nprogram for local coastal dwellers, constituted in Cooperative Societies, in order to achieve the change of vision necessary \nfor aquaculture to become a strong drive to achieve several of the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN\u2019s 2030 agenda.272\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY OF MARICULTURE SYSTEMS WITH \nALTERNATIVE FUELS \u2013 LCA CONSIDERATIONS\nNikola Vladimir*, Marija Korican, Vladimir Soldo, Zdenko Tonkovic\nUniversity of Zagreb, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture (UNIZAG FSB), \nIvana Lucica 5, 10002, Zagreb, Croatia\nnikola.vladimir@fsb.hr\nAquaculture is expanding sector on the global level resulting in higher concerns for its sustainability. Generally, sustainability \ncan be defined as a process of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to \nmeet their needs, and it is considered to be constituted of three pillars: the economy, society and environment. This work \nconsiders environmental pillar of sustainability of mariculture systems, with a goal to investigate effect of alternative \npowering options in mariculture on its lifetime environmental footprint. In this sense the alternative mariculture system \nfrom Korican at al. (2022) has been considered. This work, as a result of INTEL-MARIC project, conducted at UNIZAG \nFSB considers set of alternative fuels (LNG, Methanol, Biodiesel) and associated emissions (CO2, NOx, SO, and PM) of \nthe mariculture system. The life-cycle assessment (LCA) indicates that significant environmental benefits are possible in \ncase of alternative mariculture sysrem layouts and by use of alternative fuels like for instance methanol or biodiesel.\nSelected references\nKori\u010dan, M., Per\u010di\u0107, M., Vladimir, N., Soldo, V ., Jovanovi\u0107, I.: Environmental and economic assessment of mariculture \nsystems using a high share of renewable energy sources, J.

Zertuche-Gonz\u00e1lez*\nInstituto de Investigaciones Oceanol\u00f3gicas\nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California- Ensenada\nzertuche@uabc.edu.mx\nMexico\u00b4s seaweed industry started in the late 50\u00b4s, in the Pacific northeast coast of the Baja California peninsula, with \nthe commercial harvesting of Macrocystis pyrifera , Gelidium  robustum  and Chondracanthus canaliculatus , as sources of \nphycocolloids. Presently, the use of seaweed in Mexico has diversify to uses such as seaweed extracts for agriculture, balance \nfeed for marine cultivated organisms (abalone and fish) and even small amounts for human consumption. Other species \nhave been harvested to produce phycocolloids  ( Gracilaria-Gracilariopsis , C. squarrulosus ) and for new applications \n(Eisenia , Laminaria , Pyropia ). Practically all the seaweed use for these products is harvested from natural beds which have \ndecreased in a combination of higher demand and climate change. The efforts to develop the necessary studies for seaweed \ncultivation started in the mid-eighties. \nIn the early nineties and following the success of the commercial cultivation of Gracilaria  in Chile, Mexico was part \nof a Latin-American initiative, supported by FAO, to promote the interest on seaweed cultivation in the region. By the \nmid-nineties, the first papers in methods for seaweed cultivation appeared. Many studies on the ecology and reproductive \nbiology on the species of commercial interest were published simultaneously .  \nAt the end of the 90\u2019s, a program for the cultivation of the Atlantic algae Chondrus crispus  cultivation in ponds was tested \nfor the first time and cultivation in the sea was developed using plastic mesh tubes. Both culture methods were tested with \nanother red algae species such as C. squarrulosus , G lemaneiformis , Pyropia perforata . Following the basic methodologies \nproposed in the literature for the cultivation of kelps, in a program focused on the development of integrated aquaculture, \nexperimental cultures studies for Macrocystis pyrifera  and E. arborea  were tested in several sites along the temperate \nPacific coast of Baja California. These studies evidenced the possibility to develop the commercial cultivation of kelps in \nthis region. However, it was not until 2016 that the cultivation of Ulva spp, for human consumption, at a commercial pilot \nlevel in ponds, justified the establishment of the first commercial cultivation farm Currently, about 120 wet tons per year \nare produced commercially. Production is continuous throughout the year. On the other hand, commercial trails for kelp \ncultivation in the ocean have initiated. Although the production of seaweeds in Mexico through aquaculture is still small, its \npossibility of growth, both onshore and offshore, are promising due to optimal oceanographic, geographic, and economic \nconditions.275\nMICROCYSTIN-LR INDUCING FERROPTOSIS IN INTESTINE OF COMMON CARP \n(Cyprinus carpio ) AND INFLUENCES INTERACTIONS BETWEEN INTESTINAL \nMICROBIOTA AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\nYuanyuan Zhang*, Liansheng Wang\nHeilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute\nChinese Academy of Fishery Sciences\nHarbin 150070, China\nYuanyuan85945@126.com\nPrevious studies provide comprehensive evidence of the environmental hazards and intestinal toxicity of microcystin-LR \n(MC-LR) exposure. However, the interaction between the aquacultural environment and aquatic organisms, and underlying \ninjury mechanisms in the intestine in response to MC-LR require further clarification. In the present study, juvenile \ncommon carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) were exposed to MC-LR (0 and 10 \u03bcg/L) for 14 days. The results suggest that organic \nanion-transporting polypeptides 3a1, 4a1, 2b1, and 1d1 mediate MC-LR entry into intestinal tissues. Lesion morphological \nfeatures (vacuolization, deformation and dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum [ER], absence of mitochondrial cristae), \nup-regulated mRNA expressions of ER stress, iron accumulation, and down-regulated activity of antioxidant enzymes and \nglutathione (GSH) content were all typical characteristics of ferroptosis in intestinal tissue following MC-LR exposure. \nVerrucomicrobia  and Bdellovibrionota  were significantly associated with water quality (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) \nand GSH, and thus are suitable biomarkers of aquaculture and even natural environments in response to MC-LR exposure. \nThese findings provide new perspectives of the ferroptosis mechanism of MC-LR-induced intestinal injury in the common \ncarp, clarify the interactions between organisms and aquatic environments, and lay a foundation for biosafety assessment.276\nOPTIMIZATION OF ENCAPSULATION BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE MOLECULES \nOBTAINED FROM MIXED Halopteris scoparia AND Pistacia lentiscus  EXTRACTS\nTanja Jovi\u0107a, Zrinka \u010co\u0161i\u0107b, Ivona Elez Garofuli\u0107b, Patricija \u010culinab, Sandra Pedisi\u0107b, Zdenka Pelai\u0107b, \nVerica Dragovi\u0107-Uzelacb and Zoran Zori\u0107b*\naPharmacy Zadar, Jurja Barakovi\u0107a 2, Zadar, Croatia\nbFaculty of Food Technology & Biotechnology, University of Zagreb, Pierottijeva 6, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia\nzzoric@pbf.hr \nDue to the rich source of biologically active molecules (BAM), extracts from algae and plants are an excellent potential for \nthe production of functional foods with added value. Despite the fact that today there are many researches on different plant \nspecies, their application in the production of functional products is not sufficient. Studies have shown that the brown alga \nHalopteris scoparia  is a source of various BAM\u2019s such as amino acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, sterols, minerals, dietary \nfibers, fatty acids and pigments (El-Din & Alagawany, 2019., Mi\u0161urcov\u00e1 et al., 2014), which have enormous functional \nand nutraceutical potential, while on the other hand, the analysis of mastic tree ( Pistacia lentiscus  L.) leaves, stems, fruits \nand roots revealed significantly higher concentration of the main groups of secondary metabolites (flavonoids, phenolic \nacids and tannins), indicating that the plant has great biological potential (Dragovi\u0107 et al., 2020). Due to the different \ncomposition of BAM, these two remarkable natural sources show a greater synergistic effect in the production of functional \nproducts by mixing the extracts. Given the particular sensitivity to degradation of BAM by temperature, pH, enzymes, \nand oxygen, encapsulation has proven to be an effective way to protect these compounds, especially in the production of \nfunctional foods. Therefore, the aim of this work was to optimize the spray-drying conditions of mixed extracts from the \nalgae H. scoparia  and P . lentiscus  using two different carriers (maltodextrin DE 13-17 and gum arabica) on the phenolic \nand pigment content and physical properties of the obtained powder at spray-drying temperature of 120, 150 and 180 \u00b0C \nand wall-to-core ratio of 1:20.\nThe powders prepared with MD had lower product yield but better other physical properties and retention of BAC. The \nobtained results showed a strong synergistic effect of phenols from Mediterranean plants and algal pigments and their \nencapsulation by spray drying, which can be an excellent basis for further research and production of new value-added \nfunctional foods.\n", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
