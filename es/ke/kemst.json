Some studies have found that it increases morbidity and mortality. There are new lines of research that are investigating the link between hyponatraemia and patient falls.Aim\nTo determine if hyponatraemia is associated with falls in elderly hospitalised patients.Methods\nDesign observational, analytical, case\u2013control study.Study population\nPatients older than 65 years who had fallen during their hospitalisation at Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Hospital (Madrid) were considered cases. Patients who did not fall were considered to be controls, paired according to the following variables: hospital ward, age, length of hospital stay, gender and Downton fall risk index. The sample size was 206 subjects.Data collection\nSocio-demographic factors, variables included in the falls record sheet, Downton fall risk index and sodium levels were studied (hyponatraemia was considered Na+<135mmol/l).Analysis\nA descriptive analysis was performed to determine the sample homogeneity. The OR was calculated, and an analytical analysis using Chi-square test and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were also performed.Results\nOf 103 cases recruited, 61 were men (50.4%) and 42 were women (49.4%). Hyponatraemia was detected in 29 cases with an association with falls of P: 0.002. The adjusted OR was 3.708 (1.6\u20138.3), 95% CI. Risk factors for falls were identified as hyponatraemia and limb sensory deficits.Conclusions\nGiven that hyponatraemia could be considered a risk factor for falls, the inclusion of the determination of sodium level would be important for fall prevention strategies in the elderly.\nLa hiponatremia es el trastorno electrol\u00edtico m\u00e1s frecuente. Algunos estudios afirman que aumenta la morbimortalidad. Existen nuevas l\u00edneas de investigaci\u00f3n que buscan la relaci\u00f3n entre hiponatremia y ca\u00eddas.Objetivo\nDeterminar si la hiponatremia es un factor relacionado con las ca\u00eddas en ancianos hospitalizados.M\u00e9todo\nDise\u00f1o observacional anal\u00edtico de casos y controles.Poblaci\u00f3n de estudio\nSe consideraron casos los pacientes mayores de 65 a\u00f1os que experimentaron una ca\u00edda durante su ingreso en unidades de hospitalizaci\u00f3n del Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n de Madrid. Los controles fueron pacientes que no wxperimentaron ca\u00edda, pareados seg\u00fan las variables: unidad, edad, periodo de ingreso, g\u00e9nero y Downton. El tama\u00f1o fue de 206 sujetos.Recogida de datos\nSe estudiaron factores sociodemogr\u00e1ficos, las variables incluidas en la ficha de registro de ca\u00eddas y escala de Downton, y el sodio s\u00e9rico. Se consider\u00f3 hiponatremia Na+<135mmol/l.An\u00e1lisis\nSe realiz\u00f3 un an\u00e1lisis descriptivo para valorar la homogeneidad de la muestra, un an\u00e1lisis anal\u00edtico utilizando el test chi cuadrado, calculando la OR y un an\u00e1lisis multivariante con regresi\u00f3n log\u00edstica.Resultados\nDe 103 casos, 61 eran hombres (50,4%) y 42 mujeres (49,4%). En 29 se detect\u00f3 hiponatremia; la relaci\u00f3n con las ca\u00eddas fue p: 0,002. La OR ajustada fue de 3,708 (1,6\u20138,3), IC 95%. Se identificaron como factores de riesgo para las ca\u00eddas: hiponatremia y d\u00e9ficits sensoriales en extremidades.Conclusiones\nDado que la hiponatremia puede considerarse un factor de riesgo de ca\u00eddas, ser\u00eda importante valorar la inclusi\u00f3n de la determinaci\u00f3n de sodio s\u00e9rico dentro de las estrategias de prevenci\u00f3n de ca\u00eddas en ancianos.\nThe WHO defines a fall as the consequence of an involuntary event resulting in the person coming inadvertently to the ground.\n[1](#bib0090)\nFalling is one of the risks patients have during their hospital stay. Even when falls do not cause injury, they may have a negative effect in elderly adults: restricting their physical activity and increasing the risk of another fall.\n[2](#bib0095) Twenty-seven per cent (27%) of adults over the age of 65 fall once a year and 15% fall more than once a year. [3](#bib0100)\nFalls are an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in people over the age of 65.\n[1,4\u20137](#bib0090) There is evidence that 3.7% of hospitalised patients in Spain experience a fall, [8](#bib0125) and intrinsic and extrinsic factors are involved in its aetiology. [9](#bib0130) In a controlled hospital environment, accidental falls attributable to an extrinsic factor are much less common than non-accidental falls attributable to an intrinsic factor. [2](#bib0095) The intrinsic factors include age-related physiological alterations, acute or chronic diseases, altered consciousness, difficulty walking and medication. [10](#bib0135) Implementing and evaluating fall prevention protocols forms part of the safety strategy in the care of hospitalised patients. [8](#bib0125)\nAs there are multiple, predisposing physical risk factors for falls, it is essential to evaluate the risk of patients who have a fall to thus ensure that all the possible factors have been assessed.\n[2](#bib0095) This risk is currently measured according to different scales in the hospitals in our setting. The scale used most often is the Downton Fall Risk Index, [11](#bib0140) which does not include acute hyponatraemia among the items assessed. The manifestations of acute hyponatraemia include lethargy, confusion, gait instability, cognitive impairment and loss of consciousness. [5,12,13](#bib0110) New evidence also associates hyponatraemia with bone demineralisation, recurrent falls and fractures; thus it should be considered an important independent risk factor for falls. [5,6,14](#bib0110)\nTherefore, it must be determined whether hyponatraemia may be a risk factor to be systematically assessed and included in fall prevention protocols. Thus, the objective of this study is to determine whether hyponatraemia is a risk factor for falls in the hospitalised population over the age of 65.Material and methodsType of design\nObservational, case\u2013control, analytical study. The study period was from 1 April 2013 to 14 December 2013.Study scope\nThis study was carried out at the Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n of Madrid [Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n General University Hospital] at the following hospitalisation units: Internal Medicine, Digestive Unit, Neurology, Geriatrics, Orthogeriatrics, Neurosurgery, Medical Oncology and Cardiology.Study population\nWe included male and female patients over the age of 65 who were hospitalised at the Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n in Madrid, in the units mentioned above, who agreed to voluntarily participate in the study and gave their informed consent.\nCase definition: patients hospitalised at one of the study units, over 65 years of age and who experienced a fall during their hospital stay.\nControl definition: for case\u2013control we selected a patient hospitalised in the same unit and during the same time period who had not fallen, and who was paired in terms of age, gender and modified Downton index score, thus enabling us to identify a patient with a high risk of falling when their score was 3 or greater (\n[Fig. 1](#fig0005)).\nSample size was estimated according to the following: OR (hyponatraemia/fall association: 2.8 obtained in a preliminary study); power of 90% and 95% confidence interval, with replacement of losses.\nSample size was 103 patient pairs of cases and controls.\nThe following information was obtained for both the patients and the control subjects:\n- \u2022\nSociodemographic data: age, gender, hospitalisation unit.\n- \u2022\nClinical data: serum sodium levels at the time of the fall or in the most recent analytical test conducted before the fall; for the control subjects we recorded the serum sodium level closest to the time they were included in the study and their modified Downton index score.\n- \u2022\nData from the centre's fall registry file: date of admission, previous falls, information on referral, limitations in mobility and walking, consciousness status, presence of sensory impairment, problems bowel problem's or urinary incontinence, drug or alcohol addiction, prescribed medication, safety devices required.\n- \u2022\nFor the cases of fall, the following variables were also considered: date and time of fall, whether they were alone, consequences, activity, environmental, safety and therapeutic devices at the time of the fall.\nThis study was approved by the Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n of Madrid Independent Ethics Committee.Data collection\nWhen a fall occurred, it was reported to a team member and, after obtaining informed consent, all the study variables were collected. In parallel, a control subject was recruited who had given prior consent, and the same information was recorded for the control subject except for the information regarding the environment, circumstances and consequences of the fall.Statistical analysis\nThe statistical analysis was carried out using the Access and SPSS V.21 for Windows computer programmes (IBM1 Corporation, New York, U.S.A.).\nHyponatraemia was defined as serum Na+ values <135mmol/l.\n[14](#bib0155)\nA descriptive statistical analysis of the variables was carried out, with frequencies and percentages in the case of qualitative variables; mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range, according to distribution for qualitative variables. Frequencies were compared with the Chi-squared test in the case of qualitative variables and with the Student's t-test for quantitative variables. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nTo quantify the magnitude of the association between the different variables studied, the results are presented with their odds ratio (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).\nA bivariate and multivariate analysis was carried out (adjusted for potential confounding factors) by a binary logistic regression model using the method to be introduced, extracting from the model those variables that presented higher p-values, and calculating the raw ORs adjusted for each of the factors included.Results\nDuring the study period 4415 patients were admitted and 135 falls occurred.\n[Table 1](#tbl0005) describes the sociodemographic and clinical variables of the groups of cases and controls, and shows that there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with regard to these variables, so the groups were homogenous.\nSociodemographic and clinical variables of the case group and controls.

We also showed the relationship between falls and sensory impairment in the extremities. This association was independent from other factors, such as: medications, auditory impairment in communication or visual impairment and continence problems. Therefore, it can be concluded that hyponatraemia is a risk factor for falls.\nThe manifestations of acute hyponatraemia include lethargy, confusion, gait instability and loss of consciousness. These are all symptoms that are assessed using the Downton fall risk index, but they are not identified as symptoms of a disease requiring early treatment, such as hyponatraemia; rather, they are considered to be symptoms related to patient's age and physical status that lead to the application of restrictive measures and adapting the environment to prevent falls. Additionally, hyponatraemia has traditionally been considered asymptomatic and its treatment, unnecessary.\n[5,12,13](#bib0110)\nIn view of our results, patients should be evaluated clinically including in the differential diagnosis whether the symptoms and risk factors presented are due to a state of hyponatraemia or other reasons.\nUntil 2006, only one study had investigated the association between falls and the presence of hyponatraemia.\n[5,6,15](#bib0110) In recent years, studies have emerged demonstrating that hyponatraemia is an important independent risk factor for falls and is related to fractures. [5,6,16](#bib0110) The results obtained are consistent with these conclusions, considering hyponatraemia and sensory impairment to be risk factors that directly impact falls.\nIn Spain, approximately 30% of people over the age of 65 fall once a year, and, of these, 50% fall again in the same year.\n[2,3](#bib0095) Given this high prevalence and considering that falls are more common in institutionalised elderly patients, [2](#bib0095) the conclusions of this study take on special clinical relevance: there are great repercussions in the safety of the most vulnerable patients, as falls are an important source of comorbidity and deterioration in quality of life. [3](#bib0100)\nCertain physical conditions and environmental situations have been described in the literature which are predisposing factors for falls and can be modified, such as the intake of some drugs, activity level and the environment.\n[2](#bib0095) Therefore, while elderly patients are hospitalised they should be routinely asked about falls, the risk should be evaluated and the underlying factors susceptible to change should be approached.\nAccording to the Pharmacovigilance centre of the Community of Madrid, since the year 1992 there has been a 70% increase in the cases of hyponatraemia attributable to drugs, and half of these cases occurred in patients over the age of 75. The most related drugs are antidepressants (33%), diuretics (35%), desmopressin (28%) and antiepileptic drugs (26%). However, in our study we did not find a direct relationship between taking drugs and falls.\nThe need and importance of implementing programmes that guarantee patient safety is incontestable, including fall prevention.\n[8,17](#bib0125) To this end, effective tools must be created to assess the risks factors for falls in hospitalised patients.\nIn view of the above, and as a result of the data provided by this study, we believe that hyponatraemia is a risk factor for falls and serum sodium should be determined and included in the falls risk assessment scales, and be part of the fall prevention strategies in the elderly.\nLastly, it should be highlighted that efficiency has become one of the main concerns of healthcare managers, which has led to a major upsurge in financial assessment analyses in the last decade. Therefore, since healthcare costs must be considered among the reasons for implementing the measures proposed, we believe that cost studies should be conducted, enabling us to evaluate the efficiency of including serum sodium measurements in fall risk scales.Conflicts of interest\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\n[Annex PRECAHI Corporate Group]\nElena Calderari Fern\u00e1ndeza, Laura Collados-G\u00f3mezb, Eulalia Garc\u00eda-Pe\u00f1ac, Yassira Gracia San Rom\u00e1nd, Giovanna Herranz-Borregoe, Dolores Isac P\u00e9rezf, Margarita Medina-Torresa, Esther Quir\u00f3s Abajog, Cristina Sanz de Luish.\na Nursing Group, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Healthcare Research Institute of Madrid.\nb Preventative Medicine and Quality Management Service, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n of Madrid.
