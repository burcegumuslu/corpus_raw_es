We do this in partnership with locally-run organizations and networks of churches united by a common goal to serve their communities together in Christ. Through relationships with our partners, we support and encourage local churches, coming alongside them to amplify what they already successfully do to serve their communities.\nGlobal Serving Teams are an opportunity to witness God\u2019s work, serve alongside our global partners fighting poverty and injustice in their communities, and build reach and meaningful relationships.\nTypical serving teams spend the week with a local church to build relationships, attend the church\u2019s Sunday service, serve together with the community on a hands-on project or ministry, and focus on learning from the local church in the context they serve in.\nInterested in joining a global team?
