There was a few skunky touches early on but for the most part the beer featured the usual corn, hay & basic adjunct flavours but not much else. It was easy to drink throughout though, probably due to the heat in Cuba & as such I can't imagine it's one I'd have again if I were in the UK & it was more readily available here.\nQuite a basic & fairly poor lager but not unlike what I was expecting going in really & at least it wasn't offensive or off-putting.
