In the 1570s, the king of Spain commissioned Hern\u00e1ndez to create \u201ca Pliny of the New World.\u201d To do so,\n[Hern\u00e1ndez traveled across Mesoamerica](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/epidemics/epidemics-english/mesoamerican-herbals/serpents-tongue) consulting with Native herbalists, hoping to collect all Native American knowledge about nature and medicine in a single encyclopedic work. Hern\u00e1ndez was never able to complete the monumental task: not only did he find Native American knowledge too vast and confounding to be synthesized in a single descriptive work, but his expedition was also deterred by harrowing epidemic outbreaks.\nImage Source\n- Pliny the Elder.
