Although it can often relieve symptoms of PMS, this remedy is thought to help by addressing a specific hormone imbalance, so contrary to belief, it may not be answer to all ladies\u2019 problems. Let me explain.\nUnderstanding your hormones is key! Although many of us learnt this in school, it\u2019s easily forgotten and misunderstood.\nSo, the two main female sex hormones are called oestrogen and progesterone. These hormones take part in a delicate balancing act throughout the month in order to prepare the lining of your womb for potential impregnation, trigger ovulation and then prompt the arrival of your period. Both hormones have an important role and fluctuate throughout the month, however, if one becomes dominant relative to the other when it shouldn\u2019t, we can suffer as a result.\n[Still not up to speed on the monthly cycle? Read our blog for a step by step guide.](/health/periods/understanding-your-period-and-hormone-imbalance/)\nAll women (even men actually) need oestrogen, but, in the wrong balance it is thought to give rise to a whole host of symptoms \u2013 and is even though to be responsible for many cases of\n[PMS and the symptoms we associate with it.](/health/pms/symptoms/) Think heavy, [painful periods,](/health/pms/symptoms/period-pain/) often arriving more frequently than every 28 days (21-27 day cycles may need some Agnus attention), plus, not to mention the [tender breasts](/health/pms/symptoms/sore-breasts/), [water retention,](/health/pms/symptoms/bloating/) and [erratic mood swings](/health/pms/symptoms/mood-swings/) (more irritable or angry than sad) to go with them.\nIf these symptoms sound familiar, then\n[Agnus castus is quite likely to be the right remedy for you,](/herbal-remedies/agnus-castus/) so many women are on the right tracks. Agnus castus gently helps to support the hormone progesterone. I like to think of progesterone as oestrogen\u2019s little minder. By supporting your progesterone levels you can help keep oestrogen in check and nicely in balance.\nProgesterone dominance, however, is a totally different type of hormone imbalance which is thought to be affecting more and more women in modern times \u2013 the use of progesterone-based methods of contraception may or may not, have something to do with this. Although we don\u2019t advocate the use of hormone balancing herbs whilst on hormonal meds, when women eventually come off of them, this is often when hormonal imbalance becomes apparent and needs addressing.\nAlthough we know that progesterone helps balance oestrogen, too much the other way and it can become overbearing and oestrogen doesn\u2019t stand a chance to shine. Oestrogen is important for supporting everything from\n[our mood](/health/stress-anxiety-low-mood/) to [our skin](/health/skin/), so too little oestrogen (ask any menopausal women) can leave us feeling low in mood, lacking in confidence, tired, it can affect our skin, and leave our periods few and far between.\nSo, what\u2019s the solution? Agnus castus? Well, no, and this is key. We already know that Agnus castus helps support progesterone, so we probably don\u2019t need any more help on that front, what we want instead, is to support our oestrogen levels.\n[This is where fermented soy isoflavones come in.](/herbal-remedies/soy-isoflavones/)\nNow traditionally,\n[fermented soy isoflavones have been used by women approaching the menopause.](/health/menopause/) This makes perfect sense, as we know that oestrogen levels start to drop off around this time in our lives.\nHowever, we are now beginning to understand that younger women may need to support their oestrogen levels too. Fermented soy isoflavones may instead be the remedy to help gently support your oestrogen levels and bring some welcome relief from an undesirable set of symptoms.\n[Looking for a solution to to help with symptoms such as menstrual cramps, breast tenderness, bloating, irritability, mood swings?](/herbal-remedies/agnus-castus/)\nBuy now from your local store.\n\u201cTop-notch quality, this stuff is a life saver!\u201d Larissa Matharu\nTo find local independent stores in your area that sell Agnus castus, simply type your postcode below.\nTake my quiz & test your knowledge!\nAs the A.Vogel Women's Health advisor, I recommend Agnus castus to help relieve symptoms such as menstrual cramps, breast tenderness and irritability.\nDid you know period pain occurs when the muscles in your uterus contract\nand they can contract strongly enough to deliver a baby!
