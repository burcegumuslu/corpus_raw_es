Despite the ban, both the legal and illegal trade of mercury are thriving, resulting in complex and multifaceted issues with devastating health and environmental impacts. Collaborative efforts are needed to prioritise sustainable and ethical practices to address the illegal mercury trade.\n\u2014\nWhy Is Mercury Dangerous?\nMercury can affect the neurological and nervous systems. The\n[World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mercury-and-health) reports that mercury exposure can cause tremors, insomnia, memory loss, neuromuscular effects, headaches, and cognitive and motor dysfunction. Prolonged exposure can lead to irreversible neurological damage. The toxic metal can also contaminate the environment, and mercury pollution can lead to poisoning in humans and wildlife that eat contaminated fish. Smugglers continue to transport mercury from Guyana to neighbouring countries, despite the risks to human health and the environment.\nYou might also like:\n[Cobalt Mining: The Dark Side of the Renewable Energy Transition](https://earth.org/cobalt-mining/)\nMercury Trade in South America\nMercury has long been used in small-scale gold mining throughout South America due to its ability to bind with flecks of gold and form an amalgam that simplifies collection. However, increasing scrutiny of the metal\u2019s health and environmental impact is leading to its prohibition throughout the continent. Unfortunately, this puts economies that rely on gold mining at risk of collapse, and smugglers are taking advantage of the situation.\nOne of the last countries legally importing mercury is\n[Guyana](https://mercurio.infoamazonia.org/en/guyana/), making it a nexus for smuggling mercury into neighbouring countries. 20,000 kilogrammes of mercury are [legally imported](https://www.iucn.nl/app/uploads/2021/03/regional_mercury_report_guyana.pdf) into Guyana\u2019s capital Georgetown every year from the US, the UK, Russia, and other countries. Increasingly, large quantities are also being imported on the [black market](https://guyanatimesgy.com/govt-to-probe-gold-mercury-smuggling-trotman/), representing a multi-million dollar industry of both legal and illicit trade in mercury.\nIn the centre of Georgetown, dozens of gold shops and mining supply stores divide up and sell mercury under the table in small quantities. From there, mini-buses and charter planes distribute the mercury to small-time buyers of gold mines throughout the interior of Guyana and traffic it to neighbouring countries where it is sold at ten times the price. Talking about mercury is taboo for most traders who lack the paperwork to legally move the liquid metal.\n[Mahdia](https://delvedatabase.org/uploads/resources/Artisanal-Gold-Mining-Activities-in-Guyana.pdf) is a historic gold-producing centre in Guyana\u2019s interior surrounded by mines scattered throughout the lush forests. There, miners go into cold water early in the morning, sometime around 5 a.m., to start pumping water. From 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day, they use silver mercury to drop it on the sheet, then they put the silver into the pond or trouble, and the silver still runs. Without the silver, they cannot catch any gold. Mercury binds with flecks of gold to form an amalgam that\u2019s easier to collect. Without it, miners would go home empty-handed.\nThe bustling commerce of Mahdia embodies the free spirit of the Guyanese interior, where gold fever has a firm grip on the people.\nBuyers and jewellers in Mahdia burn off excess mercury from fresh mine gold, turning a shapeless mass into refined bars, all the while exposing themselves to an invisible danger. Smelting or dealing with a lot of mercury requires suiting up and gearing up, but not everyone takes these precautions.\nCan We Stop Illegal Mercury Trade?\nThe Guyanese government ratified an international treaty in 2014 aimed at reducing mercury, known as the\n[Minamata Convention](https://mercuryconvention.org/en), which requires them to phase out its use, putting miners who rely on mercury at odds with the government. If the prohibition of mercury goes into effect, it will have significant implications for the livelihoods of miners and communities across the Amazon.\nThe prohibition of mercury would certainly be a significant blow to the economies that rely on gold mining in South America. However, there are\n[alternative](https://blogs.iadb.org/caribbean-dev-trends/en/gold-mining_environment_climate/), less harmful methods of mining that could be implemented. The long-term benefits of transitioning to these methods would far outweigh the short-term economic costs. Governments in the region need to take a stand and prioritise the health and well-being of their citizens over short-term economic gains.\nThe smugglers and black-market traders are not the only ones to blame for the continued use of mercury. The consumers who buy gold without considering its source also bear responsibility. It is important to be aware of the supply chains behind the products we buy and to support sustainable and ethical practices.\nThe situation in Guyana and the surrounding countries is complex and multifaceted. It is clear that the use of mercury in gold mining needs to end, but it is also important to consider the livelihoods of the miners and the economic impact of the prohibition. Solutions will require a collaborative effort from governments, miners, and consumers.\nAs the world becomes more interconnected, issues like mercury use in small-scale gold mining in South America become increasingly relevant to us all. It is important to educate ourselves and support sustainable practices that prioritise the health and well-being of people and the environment. The path to a better future begins with awareness, education, and action.\nFeatured image:\n[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sulphur_Bank_Mercury_Mine.jpg)\nYou might also like:\n[The Environmental Problems Caused by Mining](https://earth.org/environmental-problems-caused-by-mining/)", "language": null, "image": "https://u4d2z7k9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-683-\u00d7-1024px-1024-\u00d7-683px-24.jpg", "pagetype": "article", "links": [null, "https://earth.org/", "https://members.earth.org/", "https://earth.org/donations/", "https://kids.earth.org/", "/", "/favourite-posts/", "https://earth.org/climate-change/", "https://earth.org/energy/", "https://earth.org/pollution/", "https://earth.org/policy-and-economics/", "https://earth.org/oceans/", "https://earth.org/biodiversity/", "https://earth.org/conservation/", "https://earth.org/solutions/", "https://earth.org/guides/", "#", "https://earth.org/donations/", "/mission-statement/", "/impact-and-reach/", "https://earth.org/our-planets-trajectory/", "/meet-the-team/", "/meet-the-team/#data-scientists", "/meet-the-team/#writers-contributors", "/global-ambassadors/", "/photographers/", "/ngo-partners/", "https://movement.earth.org/", "#", "#", "https://earth.org/policy-and-economics", "https://earth.org/pollution", "https://earth.org/author/dr-fanny-yuen/", "https://earth.org/location/americas", "https://earth.org/write-for-us/", "https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mercury-and-health", "https://earth.org/cobalt-mining/", "https://movement.earth.org/", "https://movement.earth.org/", "https://movement.earth.org/", "https://movement.earth.org/", "https://movement.earth.org/", "https://movement.earth.org/", "https://movement.earth.org/", "https://movement.earth.org/", "https://mercurio.infoamazonia.org/en/guyana/", "https://www.iucn.nl/app/uploads/2021/03/regional_mercury_report_guyana.pdf", "https://guyanatimesgy.com/govt-to-probe-gold-mercury-smuggling-trotman/", "https://delvedatabase.org/uploads/resources/Artisanal-Gold-Mining-Activities-in-Guyana.pdf", "https://mercuryconvention.org/en", "https://blogs.iadb.org/caribbean-dev-trends/en/gold-mining_environment_climate/", "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sulphur_Bank_Mercury_Mine.jpg", "https://earth.org/environmental-problems-caused-by-mining/", "https://earth.org/author/dr-fanny-yuen/", "mailto:", "https://earth.org/the-growth-of-renewable-energy-what-does-the-future-hold/", "https://earth.org/energy", "https://earth.org/policy-and-economics", "https://earth.org/solutions", "https://earth.org/the-growth-of-renewable-energy-what-does-the-future-hold/", "https://earth.org/david-attenborough-new-film-a-life-on-our-planet/", "https://earth.org/climate-change", "https://earth.org/guides", "https://earth.org/policy-and-economics", "https://earth.org/solutions", "https://earth.org/david-attenborough-new-film-a-life-on-our-planet/", "https://earth.org/what-is-tragedy-of-the-commons/", "https://earth.org/climate-change", "https://earth.org/policy-and-economics", "https://earth.org/what-is-tragedy-of-the-commons/", "#", "https://www.instagram.com/earthorg/", "/mission-statement/", "/impact-and-reach/", "/data-visualizations/", "/teachers/", "/parents/", "/kids/", "/meet-the-team/", "/join/", "https://earth.org/donations/", "https://earth.org/global-ambassadors/", "/terms/", "/privacy/", "/cookies/", "https://www.facebook.com/earth.org", "https://www.instagram.com/earthorg/", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/earth-org/", "https://twitter.com/EarthOrg", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiKZx3j6WlIoQBU6h7WqF7A/videos", "https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKML2NkgswhbinAw?oc=3&ceid=US:en", "/partnering/", "/fund-our-mission/", "/supporters/", "https://movement.earth.org/", "https://earth.org/newswire/", "/photographers/", "https://earth.org/photocompetition/", "https://earth.org/conservationists/", "/volunteer/", "/write-for-us/", "/edit-for-us/", "/help-data-science/", "/create-a-chapter/", "tel:+85221104370 ", "/contact", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fearth.org%2Fmercury-trade%2F", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fearth.org%2Fmercury-trade%2F", "mailto:?subject=The Toxic Truth: Smugglers and Governments Fuelling Illegal Mercury Trade&body=%20https%3A%2F%2Fearth.org%2Fmercury-trade%2F", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fearth.org%2Fmercury-trade%2F&title=The Toxic Truth: Smugglers and Governments Fuelling Illegal Mercury Trade&summary=&source=", null, "https://earth.org/donations/"]}
