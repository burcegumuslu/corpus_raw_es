In New Delhi, Sanjeev Gopalakrishan said his 10-year-old son was having difficulty coming to grips with the attacks.\n\u201cHe refused to sleep on Sunday, saying he was worried about his forthcoming examinations, but confided to his mother the next morning that he was worried that terrorists would come and attack us,\u201d Gopalakrishnan told Reuters.\nMohit, a Taj employee trapped in the hotel who lost one of his colleagues, said not talking about it was helping.\n\u201cI have been asked to talk about my experience and his death so many times ... but every time I talk about it, it all comes rushing back to me. Please don\u2019t ask me to relive the nightmare again,\u201d he said, and declined to give his second name.\nSome people are turning to social networks, or organising and participating in protests and vigils as a way of coping.\nNumerous candlelight vigils and protests have been held around Mumbai, with residents remembering victims and expressing anger at political inaction, apparent intelligence lapses and slow reaction by security forces.\nA countrywide protest to express \u201canguish and anger\u201d was planned for Wednesday, according to e-mail and text messages circulating around the city.\nThe Art of Living Foundation, a spiritual outfit that focuses on meditation and rhythmic breathing, is offering a three-day trauma relief workshop for a \u201ccalmer state of mind\u201d.\nFor more stories on the Mumbai attacks, see [ID:nSP357351] (Editing by Bryson Hull and Bill Tarrant)\nOur Standards:\n[The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)", "language": null, "image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/global-gateway.html", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/login.html", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216467423-Contact-Reuters", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us", "https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/companyNews", "https://www.reuters.com/journalists/rina-chandran", "https://www.reuters.com/journalists/shilpa-jamkhandikar", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "//www.reuters.com/tools/mobile", "//newslink.reuters.com/join/subscribe", "//sales.reuters.com/en/ ", "//www.reuters.com/advertising-guidelines", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#cookies", "//www.reuters.com/terms-of-use", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "javascript:window.OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();", "https://www.reuters.com/info/disclaimer", "https://thomsonreuters.com/copyright/"]}
