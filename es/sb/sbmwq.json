It applies not just to the men and women in the street who buy the News of the World, not just to the men and women in the street who buy the Times and the Sunday Times ...but also to the political establishment.\u201d\nNews Corp said it decided to scrap the News of the World after the brand became, in Brooks\u2019 own words, \u201ctoxic\u201d, with advertisers deserting the title in droves.\nSUN ON SUNDAY\nMiddleton said he did not believe News Corp would win back people\u2019s trust simply by shutting the paper and noted a shift in attitude towards it since the announcement of the closure, with anger now focused more on the organisation itself.\n\u201cOne of the fascinating things is that News of the World has gone from being reviled, hated and scorned, to being described as Britain\u2019s iconic popular newspaper,\u201d he told Reuters.\nOthers were doubtful whether a crisis that has created huge waves in political circles would have much long-term effect on the ordinary public -- and therefore on advertisers -- and predicted that a mooted Sun newspaper on Sundays would win readers.\n\u201cGiven a sensible breather ... I do think there could be a lot of excitement [about a Sun on Sunday],\u201d said Gordon MacMillan, social media editor at Haymarket media group and founding editor of Brand Republic.\nHe noted that while companies might be nervous about advertising with other News Corp titles, so far only carmaker Renault has said it will pull advertising from them. Nevertheless, there is clearly concern at the very top of News Corp about the fallout from the News of the World affair.\nRupert Murdoch flew in to London on Sunday to tackle the crisis personally. Up to now, he has stood by Brooks and his son James Murdoch, the News Corp director responsible for overseeing News International.\nNOT FAR ENOUGH\nBut commentators have questioned whether actions taken thus far will manage to stop the crisis from tainting other Murdoch properties -- and, crucially, whether it will be enough to allow his planned multi-billion-dollar purchase of BSkyB to go ahead.\n\u201cThe interesting thing from a brand perspective is that a consumer brand is trying to behave more like a utility,\u201d said Nick Liddell, global strategy director at branding group Clear.\nUtilities, Liddell noted, were largely concerned with maintaining a reputation that would ensure they could keep their licence to operate, where permission for them to do so comes from governments or regulators.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slightly bizarre thing to do to kill a consumer brand, because I\u2019m not convinced the audience that will give News International a licence to operate will care.\n\"When BP\n[BP.L](/companies/BP.L) screws up, they don't rebrand.\"\nLiddell noted that when BP came under fire for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill last year it \u201clost the people, not the brand\u201d: \u201cThe companies that are used to behaving like utilities understand that ... having the brand is what makes them visible, and that being visible is what makes them accountable.\n\u201c(News Corp) could find that axeing News of the World does nothing to make them seem more accountable.\u201d\nReporting by Jodie Ginsberg, editing by Tim Pearce\nOur Standards:\n[The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)", "language": null, "image": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20110710&t=2&i=456051768&r=img-2011-07-10T205854Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_India-581809-1&w=800", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/global-gateway.html", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/login.html", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216467423-Contact-Reuters", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us", "https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/worldNews", "https://www.reuters.com/journalists/jodie-ginsberg", "/companies/NWSA.O", "/companies/BSY.L", "/companies/BP.L", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "//www.reuters.com/tools/mobile", "//newslink.reuters.com/join/subscribe", "//sales.reuters.com/en/ ", "//www.reuters.com/advertising-guidelines", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#cookies", "//www.reuters.com/terms-of-use", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "javascript:window.OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();", "https://www.reuters.com/info/disclaimer", "https://thomsonreuters.com/copyright/"]}
