Diet and Bloating\nExamine your diet to identify potential causes of bloat.\nLow Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides And Polyols (FODMAP) Diet is highly recommended for treating IBS symptoms\u00b9.\nIBS diagnosis is based on the Rome IV criteria, highlighting the relation of abdominal pain with defecation and changes in bowel habits\u00b9.\nA significant percentage of IBS patients, especially women, associate their symptoms with food intake. Bloating and abdominal pain are the most frequent complaints\u00b9.\nCommonly reported dietary triggers include carbohydrates, fatty foods, coffee, alcohol, and hot spices\u00b9.\nGluten can disrupt bowel barrier functions, especially in certain patients akin to celiac individuals\u00b9.\nExcessive fructose intake exacerbates NAFLD markers\u00b2 and can disturb the intestinal barrier, intensifying liver inflammation and fructose conversion into fatty deposits\u00b3.\n\u00b9 \u00b2 \u00b3\n2. Gut Health and Bloating\nAddress gut health to alleviate bloating.\nDGBIs encompass conditions like IBS, reflux hypersensitivity, and functional dyspepsia\u2074.\nSeveral factors, including past infections and psychological conditions, can lead to DGBIs\u2074.\nDisorders of gut\u2013brain interaction or FGIDs are recognized as microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain abnormalities prevalent worldwide\u2075.\nGut microbiota is susceptible to changes due to varying factors like diet and psychological state\u2075.\nMethanogenic microbes in the colon can lead to slowed gut transit and constipation due to serotonin depletion\u2075.\n\u2074 \u2075\n3. Bloodwork and Bloating\nSeek bloodwork to identify underlying causes.\nhs-CRP is linked with NAFLD\u2076.\nIBS has been found to predict higher hs-CRP levels\u2077.\nElevated ALT is often observed in IBS patients\u2078.\nExcessive gas correlates significantly with liver steatosis and heightened ALT levels\u2079.\n\u2076 \u2077 \u2078 \u2079\n4. Liver Health and Bloating\nSupport the liver for better digestion.\nIBS symptoms like abdominal pain and bloating can also indicate NAFLD\u00b9\u2070.\nCholecystitis can lead to abdominal bloating\u00b9\u00b9.\nThe gallbladder isn't essential for a healthy life\u00b9\u00b9.\n\u00b9\u2070 \u00b9\u00b9\n5. Mood, Serotonin, and Bloating\nMaintain a balanced mood and serotonin levels to manage bloating.\nSerotonin has diverse intestinal functions\u00b9\u00b2.\nIBS might be associated with serotonin dysfunction affecting gut motility\u00b9\u00b2.\nChanges in serotonin levels can be addressed with specific medications for symptom relief\u00b9\u00b3.\nEssential components for serotonin synthesis include tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6)\u00b9\u2074.\n\u00b9\u00b2 \u00b9\u00b3 \u00b9\u2074\nAs you've learned today, neurotransmitter balance plays a crucial role in our overall well-being.
