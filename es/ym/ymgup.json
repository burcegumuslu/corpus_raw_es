Mar\u00eda Cristina Carrillo, Presidenta SAIC\nEstimados Miembros de la Comunidad Cient\u00edfica del \u00e1rea Biom\u00e9dica:\nLes doy la bienvenida, en nombre de la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva de la Sociedad Argentina de Investigaci\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica, a la \nLXV Reuni\u00f3n Anual, que este a\u00f1o se lleva a cabo de manera conjunta con la Sociedad Argentina de Inmunolog\u00eda y la \nSociedad Argentina de Fisiolog\u00eda.\nEn 2020, SAIC cumple 60 a\u00f1os. Durante estas 6 d\u00e9cadas, los trabajadores de la ciencia que han transitado y que \ntransitan la Sociedad han hecho realidad lo que John Ruskin alguna vez cit\u00f3: \u201c El trabajo de la ciencia es sustituir apa -\nriencias por hechos e impresiones por demostraciones\u201d.\nDurante 60 a\u00f1os la sociedad funcion\u00f3 teniendo como meta principal la realizaci\u00f3n de Reuniones Cient\u00edficas en donde \npudieran confluir las teor\u00edas m\u00e1s novedosas, los dilemas m\u00e1s excitantes y las resoluciones cient\u00edficas m\u00e1s sorpren -\ndentes.\nDurante su existencia se produjeron acontecimientos pol\u00edticos y sociales que introdujeron importantes avances, pero \ntambi\u00e9n significativos retrocesos en el sistema cient\u00edfico y acad\u00e9mico.\nEn l\u00edneas generales, podemos decir que en Argentina, hist\u00f3ricamente, no existieron procesos concretos de inte -\ngraci\u00f3n de universidades, instituciones p\u00fablicas de I+D y empresas privadas promovidos por una red o urdimbre de \nactores de instrumentaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9rica, tal como los que se encuentran en las econom\u00edas desarrolladas.\nLa ausencia de esta trama institucional motiv\u00f3 que se fueran incrementando, a lo largo de los a\u00f1os, formas de inte -\ngraci\u00f3n subordinadas, al, por ejemplo, estandarizar la compra de instrumentos al exterior para equipar los laboratorios \ny al desarrollar una valoraci\u00f3n acr\u00edtica de los v\u00ednculos entre cient\u00edficos y grupos locales con grupos e instituciones de \npa\u00edses avanzados. \nEsta situaci\u00f3n ha llevado al complejo de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CyT) a ser funcional, en parte, a los requerimientos \nde un sistema internacional de estados muy estratificado debido a la globalizaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica que se inici\u00f3 al final \nde la 2da Guerra Mundial y se profundiz\u00f3 en la d\u00e9cada de los \u201980. Lo que nos llev\u00f3 a tener un papel subsidiario en \nel sistema econ\u00f3mico mundial. Podr\u00edamos concluir que los v\u00ednculos de dependencia en CyT son una exteriorizaci\u00f3n \nfragmentaria de la dependencia cultural y econ\u00f3mica. \nM\u00e1s all\u00e1 de esta hist\u00f3rica realidad, tanto la dictadura militar que irrumpi\u00f3 entre 1976 y 1983, como el gobierno de \ncaracter\u00edsticas neoliberales que hegemoniz\u00f3 la d\u00e9cada de los \u00b490, llevaron adelante pol\u00edticas que desarticularon sig -\nnificativamente la estructura del sistema cient\u00edfico-acad\u00e9mico y sus principales proyectos de desarrollo y condujeron \nal exilio forzado a miles de investigadores, tecn \u00f3logos  y profesores universitarios con un alto nivel de capacitaci\u00f3n.\nEn un contexto de crisis econ\u00f3mica y social sin precedentes, el gobierno que asume en mayo del 2003 se plantea \ncomo uno de sus principales objetivos la transformaci\u00f3n del modelo econ\u00f3mico-social del pa\u00eds, orient\u00e1ndolo hacia un \ncrecimiento centrado en la mejora de las capacidades productivas y la reindustrializaci\u00f3n. Esta perspectiva coloc\u00f3 a \nla educaci\u00f3n, la ciencia y la tecnolog\u00eda como sustentos de la reconstrucci\u00f3n de una sociedad con mayor crecimiento \ne integraci\u00f3n social. Como resultado de estas pol\u00edticas, en el \u00e1mbito de CyT se produjo el aumento sostenido de la \ninversi\u00f3n y la incorporaci\u00f3n de un n\u00famero sin precedentes de investigadores, tecn\u00f3logos y becarios al sistema. No \nmenos importante fue el fortalecimiento de una institucionalidad que permiti\u00f3 orientar las prioridades de la investi -\ngaci\u00f3n a las necesidades del desarrollo productivo del pa\u00eds. La creaci \u00f3n del Ministerio de Ciencia, Te cnolog\u00eda e Inno -\nvaci\u00f3n Productiva en el a\u00f1o 2007 fue uno de los hitos m\u00e1s significativos de esta etapa.\nCabe destacar que, junto con los aspectos virtuosos de este per\u00edodo que, habiendo comenzado en 2003, culmin\u00f3 en \n2015, es necesario mencionar un n\u00famero importante de limitaciones y asignaturas pendientes que no se pudieron \nafrontar o concluir exitosamente en esta etapa. Muchas de ellas impidieron avanzar en un proceso m\u00e1s profundo de \ntransformaci\u00f3n productiva, relacionada con una escasa vinculaci\u00f3n entre el sistema cient\u00edfico-tecnol\u00f3gico y el aparato \nproductivo del pa\u00eds y a la pobre integraci\u00f3n entre los distintos institutos de investigaci\u00f3n, universidades y empresas \np\u00fablicas dedicadas al desarrollo e innovaci\u00f3n.\nA partir de diciembre de 2015 y hasta 2019, se puso en pr\u00e1ctica una concepci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica general que tuvo como obje -\ntivo el repliegue del papel del Estado como conductor del proceso de crecimiento econ\u00f3mico y promotor de la equidad \nsocial que implic\u00f3 el achicamiento del estado en todas sus funciones, y, por supuesto, eso incidi\u00f3 negativamente en \nel sector cient\u00edfico - acad\u00e9mico argentino.\nLa disminuci\u00f3n de recursos aplicada al sector signific\u00f3 no solo que centenares de investigadores formados durante \na\u00f1os quedaran fuera del sistema, sino tambi\u00e9n el fin de las pol\u00edticas de crecimiento de la carrera cient\u00edfica.Estas apreciaciones volcadas en este discurso no son nuevas. Repasando los discursos de presidentes y presidentas \nanteriores, estos comentarios han sido volcados en muchos de ellos.  \nAun as\u00ed, y m \u00e1s all\u00e1 de los distintos aconteceres de la realidad nacional y de la falta de una interrelaci\u00f3n eficiente entre \nlos distintos sectores de I+D, la SAIC sigui\u00f3 funcionando y convirti\u00e9ndose para muchos becarios e investigadores \nj\u00f3venes que se quedaron en el pa\u00eds, en el escenario esperado adonde concurrir y debatir sus resultados, sus hip\u00f3tesis \ny sus teor\u00edas, de manera tal que el conocimiento en el \u00e1rea biom\u00e9dica pudo crecer sostenidamente, construido sobre \nla integraci\u00f3n interdisciplinaria. Y esto puede apreciarse en las instituciones que comparten las autor\u00edas de muchos de \nlos trabajos presentados: Institutos de investigaci\u00f3n, hospitales, bio-empresas. Las ciencias experimentales lograron \ncrear la urdimbre necesaria de manera emp\u00edrica, y en base a las necesidades reales de cada instituci\u00f3n.\nMuchos de nosotros comenzamos el a\u00f1o 2020 con muchas esperanzas. Se vislumbraba un cambio de direcci\u00f3n en \nlas pol\u00edticas de CyT. La reposici\u00f3n del Ministerio de Ciencia Tecnolog\u00eda e Innovaci\u00f3n Productiva era un s\u00edmbolo que \nindicaba el comienzo de un largo per\u00edodo de reconstrucci\u00f3n. \nEn lo personal, como Presidenta de SAIC, mi intenci\u00f3n era realizar, tal vez siendo muy ambiciosa, una reuni\u00f3n Cient\u00ed -\nfica inmensamente rica y constructiva. Pero en marzo todo nuestro universo cambi\u00f3. \nLa pandemia fue (y lo sigue siendo) la gran protagonista de este a\u00f1o y ha superado en popularidad a otras amenazas \nmundiales que parec\u00edan ser igual de peligrosas. En los primeros ocho meses de 2020 el coronavirus contagi\u00f3 a m\u00e1s \nde 24 millones de personas, produjo cerca de 1 mill\u00f3n de muertes alrededor del mundo y hasta hoy no da tregua, con \nrebrotes en zonas donde ya hab\u00eda bajado su circulaci\u00f3n. Sabemos que si hay algo que le puede devolver la normali -\ndad a nuestras vidas es el hallazgo de un medio de prevenci\u00f3n, y es en esa direcci\u00f3n en la que cient\u00edficas y cient\u00edficos \nde todo el mundo, incluido nuestro pa\u00eds, trabajan para llegar en tiempo record.\nEn este contexto, la SAIC no se detuvo. Junto con la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva, decidimos seguir trabajando, tratando de \nadaptarnos a la dura realidad, inesperada y dram\u00e1tica. En junio realizamos el Simposio de COVID19, nuestra primera \nexperiencia virtual, y en la que pudimos poner de manifiesto las \u00faltimas novedades que nuestros cient\u00edficos estaban \nproduciendo en el combate contra el virus. El \u00e9xito alcanzado nos dio la fuerza para continuar y organizar la Reuni\u00f3n \nAnual con la misma metodolog\u00eda.\nA principios de septiembre nos vimos impulsados a publicar un Llamado a la Responsabilidad Ciudadana, debido a \nla intensidad que hab\u00eda adquirido la pandemia en todo el pa\u00eds. La situaci\u00f3n era de una relevancia dram\u00e1tica, y as\u00ed lo \nexpresamos. La nota repercuti\u00f3 y fue repicada en redes y en muchos medios audiovisuales y gr\u00e1ficos de todo el pa\u00eds. \nLa notoriedad que adquiri\u00f3 esta carta a la ciudadan\u00eda, publicada en nuestra p\u00e1gina web, puso de relieve la importan -\ncia y el nivel que tiene SAIC dentro de la comunidad nacional. \nLa pandemia ha cambiado, a mi criterio, la concepci\u00f3n que ten\u00eda la ciudadan\u00eda sobre el sistema cient\u00edfico nacional, \nsobre todo luego que se pusiera en duda, en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, la capacidad del mismo. La pregunta que recorri\u00f3 \nmuchos portales durante el \u00faltimo gobierno liberal era: \u00bfPara qu\u00e9 sirve la ciencia?  La reacci\u00f3n del sistema cient\u00edfico \nante la pandemia ha dado la respuesta. Posiblemente haya un cambio esperanzador en el paradigma de lo que sig -\nnifica el desarrollo cient\u00edfico en la sociedad. Y se termine asociando el concepto de Soberan\u00eda con el de Desarrollo \nde Ciencia Nacional.\nAgradezco inmensamente a la extraordinaria Comisi\u00f3n Directiva con la que me toc\u00f3 trabajar. El entusiasmo, las ideas, \nla solidaridad de todos y todas permitieron un trabajo intenso y profundamente agradable. Agradezco especialmente \nal Dr. Alejandro Curino, vicepresidente de la SAIC, por su presencia y su soporte y por coincidir en que la forma de \npensar la sociedad y el trabajo se pueden planificar por m\u00e1s de un per\u00edodo; al Dr. Enrique Sanchez Pozzi, nuestro \ntesorero y a la Dra. Mar\u00eda Laura Ruiz, nuestra secretaria, por el enorme e invaluable trabajo que han realizado. Les \ndoy tambi\u00e9n mi agradecimiento al grupo G2, que trabaj\u00f3 codo a codo con todos nosotros, organizando esta tarea \nabsolutamente nueva.\nAgradezco a los y las participantes, simposistas, coordinadores, evaluadores, a todas y todos los que presentaron \ntrabajos, y en general, a los y las que confiaron en nosotros y se arriesgaron a esta aventura virtual. \nAgradezco, adem\u00e1s, a las otras sociedades que nos acompa\u00f1aron en esta experiencia. Entre todos hemos hecho \nposible este evento.\nDra. Mar\u00eda Cristina Carrillo\nPresidenta de SAICDiscurso de la Dra. Anal\u00eda Trevani, Presidenta SAI\nEstimadas y estimados colegas, amigas y amigos \nEn nombre de la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva de la Sociedad Argentina de inmunolog\u00eda les doy una cordial bienvenida a una \nnueva reuni\u00f3n de Sociedades de Biociencias organizada de manera conjunta por la Sociedad Argentina de Investi -\ngaci\u00f3n Cl \u00ednica, la Sociedad Argentina de Fisiolog\u00eda y las Sociedad Argentina de Inmunolog\u00eda. \nComo es de p\u00fablico conocimiento, este a\u00f1o ha sido particularmente especial en todos los aspectos que incumben a \nnuestras vidas, y nuestra actividad profesional no ha resultado ajena, como tampoco lo vinculado a la organizaci\u00f3n \nde esta actividad cient\u00edfica. Luego de muchos meses de trabajo organizando el tercer congreso Franco-Argentino \nde Inmunolog\u00eda, con 25 disertantes extranjeros que hab\u00edan comprometido su participaci\u00f3n abon\u00e1ndose sus propios \npasajes a\u00e9reos, un simposio conjunto con la \u201cSociety of Leukocyte Biology\u201d de Estados Unidos proyectado y sponsors \ninternacionales que hab\u00edan decidido acompa\u00f1arnos, debimos reprogramar la actividad, la cual, si la pandemia lo per -\nmite tendr\u00e1 lugar en 2021. A pesar de la decepci\u00f3n que esta situaci\u00f3n represent\u00f3 para esta comisi\u00f3n directiva, supimos \naprovechar alguna de las ventajas que ofrece la virtualidad y logramos confeccionar para esta reuni\u00f3n, un programa \nque involucra la participaci\u00f3n de cient\u00edficos destacados internacionalmente, que abordar\u00e1n tem\u00e1ticas diversas de gran \ninter\u00e9s para los miembros de nuestras sociedades. A todos ellos les agradecemos su gentileza y generosidad por \nparticipar de este evento. Frente a la incertidumbre que representaba la realizaci\u00f3n de una reuni\u00f3n cient\u00edfica virtual, en \nun a\u00f1o en qu\u00e9 la mayor parte de las l\u00edneas de investigaci\u00f3n debi\u00f3 ser suspendida, nos sorprendimos gratamente una \nvez m\u00e1s con la respuesta de los inmun\u00f3logos, quienes presentaron 124 trabajos de investigaci\u00f3n 4 de los cuales ser\u00e1n \ndefendidos para optar al premio Satz. Ello representa sin duda una muestra m\u00e1s de la fortaleza de nuestro sistema \ncient\u00edfico al cual nos sentimos orgullosos de pertenecer. \nQuiero aprovechar esta oportunidad para agradecer al CONICET que nos ha dado su apoyo mediante la l\u00ednea de \nfinanciamiento para reuniones cient\u00edficas y a las empresas privadas que nos han acompa\u00f1ado una vez m\u00e1s. Quiero \nagradecer tambi\u00e9n a toda la comisi\u00f3n directiva por su apoyo constante y su activa participaci\u00f3n en las acciones que \nmancomunadamente llevamos a cabo a lo largo de este a\u00f1o. Tambi\u00e9n al comit\u00e9 m\u00e9dico y al comit\u00e9 docente de nues -\ntra sociedad, en especial a Mar\u00eda Soledad Gori y Julieta Alca\u00edn por su trabajo en el manejo de las redes sociales de \nla SAI. Pero muy especialmente quiero agradecer a dos de los integrantes de nuestra comisi\u00f3n directiva; a la Dra. \nCarolina Jancic, la secretaria de nuestra sociedad, con qui\u00e9n diariamente compartimos todas las tareas que involucr\u00f3 \nesta gesti\u00f3n, y sin cuyo su enorme trabajo generoso, responsable y comprometido habr\u00eda sido imposible alcanzar los \nobjetivos que nos propusimos; y al Dr. Mat\u00edas Ostrowski, por su activa labor a cargo de la tesorer\u00eda y por su ayuda en \nla organizaci\u00f3n de lo que iba a ser FAIC2020 y su compromiso con las actividades cient\u00edficas realizadas este a\u00f1o. A \ntodos ellos quiero decirles gracias con may\u00fasculas. Tambi\u00e9n quiero agradecer a las y los integrantes de mi laboratorio \npor comprender mi menor interacci\u00f3n debido al tiempo que me demand\u00f3 llevar a cabo las actividades de la sociedad. \nNuestro principal objetivo de gesti\u00f3n fue potenciar la participaci\u00f3n de los miembros de nuestra sociedad en las distintas \nactividades a realizar; fomentar la participaci\u00f3n y visibilizaci\u00f3n de los investigadores j\u00f3venes; incrementar la diversidad \nde miembros involucrados en la  m\u00e1s amplia variedad de  tareas y federalizar nuestra sociedad. Con este fin, para cada \nuna de las actividades llevadas a cabo, convocamos a miembros de distintos lugares geogr\u00e1ficos y de diferentes es -\ncalas de formaci\u00f3n tanto para actuar como disertantes como en su rol de coordinadores de actividades cient\u00edficas. En \nlo que respecta a la presente reuni\u00f3n, seleccionamos a disertantes nacionales que no hubiesen participado en a\u00f1os \nrecientes en nuestras reuniones cient\u00edficas, con el objetivo de ampliar la difusi\u00f3n del trabajo de distintos miembros de \nnuestra sociedad. Aun cuando la pandemia signific\u00f3 un impedimento para la ejecuci\u00f3n de algunas actividades que \nten\u00edamos proyectadas, logramos tomar ventaja de la situaci\u00f3n y perseguir y alcanzar otra de las metas que nos hab\u00eda -\nmos impuesto, como la de extender el alcance de nuestras actividades para que pudieran ser aprovechadas por todos \naquellos interesados en la adquisici\u00f3n de conocimiento. Por ello, realizamos actividades de gran calidad acad\u00e9mica, \nabiertas y sin costo alguno, las cuales fueron aprovechadas no s \u00f3lo por colegas de nuestro pa\u00eds sino tambi\u00e9n de otros \npa\u00edses latinoamericanos miembros de ALACI, gracias a la intensa campa\u00f1a de difusi\u00f3n que emprendimos. Ninguna \nde estas actividades habr\u00eda sido posible sin la generosidad y el compromiso de todos aquellos que invirtieron su ti -\nempo y esfuerzo para realizar las presentaciones que nos permitieron actualizarnos en las diversas tem\u00e1ticas que se \nabordaron. A todas y todos ellos, much\u00edsimas gracias! Tambi\u00e9n a los disertantes internacionales que generosamente, y \na pesar de las diferencias horarias y en algunos casos, en medio de sus vacaciones, aceptaron ser parte de un proyec -\nto abierto de difusi\u00f3n del conocimiento cient\u00edfico.  \nNos deja un sabor amargo en esta gesti\u00f3n, el haber tomado conocimiento de que algunos miembros del \u00e1rea cl\u00ednica \nconsideren necesaria la creaci\u00f3n de una asociaci\u00f3n que los nuclee por no sentir representados sus intereses en esta \nsociedad. Aun cuando entendemos que en muchos casos el curso natural de la diversificaci\u00f3n del conocimiento con -\nduce a la necesidad de generar espacios de discusi\u00f3n propios, para la mayor parte de los miembros de esta comisi\u00f3n \ndirectiva ser\u00eda m\u00e1s enriquecedor que los mismos se gestaran en el marco de la sociedad existente. Las sociedades cient\u00edficas deber\u00edan ser espacios din\u00e1micos en d\u00f3nde la discusi\u00f3n constructiva permitiese canalizar cambios org\u00e1nicos \nen acuerdo con el avance del conocimiento. Tenemos claro, sin embargo, que ninguno de esos cambios puede ser \nllevado a cabo sin el trabajo comprometido de todos los interesados. A la luz del desarrollo de esta nueva asociaci\u00f3n, \nesperamos que en el futuro ambas sociedades se comprometan a realizar actividades conjuntas peri\u00f3dicas, porque \nello sin duda representar\u00eda un aporte mutuo. \nQuiero dedicar los \u00faltimos minutos de este espacio que se me ha brindado por mi papel dentro de la Sociedad Ar -\ngentina de Inmunolog\u00eda, para referirme al contexto en el cual transitamos esta gesti\u00f3n y su impacto. En este tiempo, \nhemos presenciado con enorme satisfacci\u00f3n la respuesta colectiva del sistema cient\u00edfico mundial para entender la                    \nfisiopatolog\u00eda de la COVID-19 y desarrollar estrategias terap\u00e9uticas para enfrentarla. Sin embargo, debido a la pan -\ndemia, tambi\u00e9n hemos sido arrasados por una vor\u00e1gine de informaci\u00f3n con y sin sustento cient\u00edfico, divulgaci\u00f3n de \nresultados de investigaciones cient\u00edficas no evaluadas por pares y de informaci\u00f3n de estudios cl\u00ednicos carentes de \nun dise\u00f1o adecuado. Dado que ello puede conducir a la toma de decisiones cl\u00ednicas sin la evidencia suficiente y con \nconsecuencias que pueden ser impredecibles para los pacientes y la sociedad, considero que como integrantes del \nsistema cient\u00edfico, esto merece que reflexionemos al respecto. \nPor otra parte, en este tiempo, tambi\u00e9n asistimos a la aparici\u00f3n en las redes y medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, de individuos \nque amparados en sus t\u00edtulos acad\u00e9micos, divulgan informaci\u00f3n pseudocient\u00edfica tergiversada a una sociedad que \nest\u00e1 ansiosa de certezas y esperanza, ocasionando un gran da\u00f1o a la sociedad ante esta situaci\u00f3n tan compleja que \nnos ha tocado vivir. Por ello, la SAI, as\u00ed como muchos de sus miembros de forma individual o colectiva, ha hecho un \ngran esfuerzo por divulgar informaci\u00f3n certera a trav\u00e9s de sus seminarios virtuales y su comunicaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de las \nredes sociales.  \nLa aparici\u00f3n de la COVID-19 tambi\u00e9n puso de relieve como nunca antes la capacidad de nuestros cient\u00edficos, los que \na pesar de estar inmersos en un sistema que en la gesti\u00f3n gubernamental anterior sufri\u00f3 un enorme deterioro, con un \nMinisterio de ciencia degradado a la categor\u00eda de secretar\u00eda, con una inversi\u00f3n en insumos, equipamiento y salarios \nabsolutamente devaluados, fue capaz de responder de manera colectiva para enfrentar esta pandemia. Fue gracias \na la calidad acad\u00e9mica de sus integrantes que se pudo dar respuesta en tiempo r\u00e9cord al desarrollo de kits diagn\u00f3sti -\ncos, de protocolos de investigaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica y cl\u00ednica, al de herramientas terap\u00e9uticas y vacunas, y al asesoramiento \nal sistema de salud. Esta capacidad de respuesta no se logra de manera repentina. Se sustenta en a\u00f1os de tiempo \ny esfuerzo para la formaci\u00f3n de recursos humanos altamente calificados e inversi\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica; se sustenta en la \ncapacidad de acceso a tecnolog\u00edas de vanguardia y en una planificaci\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica pensando en un modelo de pa\u00eds \nsoberano. La construcci\u00f3n de un sistema cient\u00edfico s\u00f3lido es un camino lento y sembrado de numerosos obst\u00e1culos, \npero su destrucci\u00f3n puede ocurrir de forma acelerada, como lo han demostrado los a\u00f1os recientes, en que las pol\u00edticas \naplicadas condujeron a la p\u00e9rdida de profesionales que costaron dinero y dedicaci\u00f3n en formar, e incrementaron la \nbrecha tecnol\u00f3gica debida a una desinversi\u00f3n sostenida. En lo personal, celebro que la actual gesti\u00f3n gubernamental \nhaya devuelto el rango ministerial a la ciencia, dado que esto no implica s\u00f3lo un cambio de nombre sino de pol\u00edticas \ny planificaci\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n celebro que sean nuestros colegas cient\u00edficos quienes est\u00e9n a cargo de dichas decisiones y \nsu esfuerzo por retener los recursos humanos ya formados y por realizar una gesti\u00f3n previsible y transparente. Pero \nsoy consciente de que esto no es suficiente; necesitamos incrementar la inversi\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en ciencia dado que \nlos insumos y equipos se encuentran dolarizados y nuestros subsidios pesificados. Entiendo las dificultades de lle -\nvarlo a la pr\u00e1ctica en el contexto de una crisis econ\u00f3mica mundial producto de la pandemia. Pero como en todos los \n\u00f3rdenes de la vida, resulta necesario establecer prioridades, y la pandemia de COVID-19 ha puesto de manifiesto que \nel sostenimiento del sistema cient\u00edfico deber\u00eda ser una de ellas. Por ello, espero que los legisladores de las distintas \nfuerzas pol\u00edticas finalmente aprueben en el parlamento una Ley de Ciencia que garantice un incremento sostenido del \nporcentaje de la funci\u00f3n ciencia y t\u00e9cnica sobre el PBI, para llevarlo en los pr\u00f3ximos diez a\u00f1os al 1,5%. \nPara concluir, quiero expresar un profundo y sentido agradecimiento a todos los miembros de las sociedades cient\u00edficas \nparticipantes que han contribuido con su trabajo y esfuerzo al diagn\u00f3stico y atenci\u00f3n de los pacientes con COVID-19, \na la investigaci\u00f3n sobre esta tem\u00e1tica y a la difusi\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n a la poblaci\u00f3n.\nTambi\u00e9n quiero expresar el deseo de la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva de la SAI de que esta primera reuni\u00f3n cient\u00edfica virtual sea \nfruct\u00edfera y que a pesar de la falta de presencialidad nos permita conectarnos y que sea el cimiento de cooperaciones \nfuturas.\nMuchas gracias, un saludo afectuoso,\n      \nAnal\u00eda Trevani\nPresidenta SAI  Discurso de la Dra. Mar\u00eda Cecilia Larocca, Presidenta SAFIS\nQueridos colegas, compa\u00f1eros y amigos,\nEs un placer y un honor para m\u00ed darles la bienvenida a la Reuni\u00f3n anual conjunta 2020, en representaci\u00f3n de la \nComisi\u00f3n directiva de la Sociedad Argentina de Fisiolog\u00eda (SAFIS). \nDe m\u00e1s est\u00e1 describir el dif\u00edcil momento que estamos viviendo como sociedad, en el que el sentimiento de angustia \nse mezcla con la tristeza y la impotencia, pero tambi\u00e9n con la esperanza y la solidaridad. Analizando c\u00f3mo impacta \neste momento a la comunidad cient\u00edfica surge mi convicci\u00f3n de que el mismo nos ofrece una oportunidad de gran \nempoderamiento. No creo que sea necesario en este \u00e1mbito remarcar la importancia que ha tenido la investigaci\u00f3n \ncient\u00edfica en la b\u00fasqueda de respuestas de fondo en este momento. Pero s\u00ed me parece importante observar c\u00f3mo \ncada uno de nosotros ha logrado cosas previamente inimaginables: continuar con nuestra tarea como investigadores \nrespetando los protocolos de aislamiento a la vez que damos clases online, desarrollamos estrategias de evaluaci\u00f3n \nvirtual,  hacemos la escuela de nuestros ni\u00f1os, trapeamos y preparamos la masa madre. Y todo esto en medio \nde una situaci\u00f3n emocional muy dura. Por lo tanto, creo que este momento tambi\u00e9n nos puede hacer repensar la \nposibilidad de potenciarnos realmente como cient\u00edficos. La posibilidad de lograr un sistema cient\u00edfico con mayor \nrepresentatividad, en el que todos nos sintamos protagonistas y demos lo mejor de nosotros. Un sistema donde \nexijamos ser escuchados, donde podamos defender nuestros proyectos, y tambi\u00e9n donde escuchemos a nuestros \npares independientemente de su trayectoria. Un sistema que permita a los investigadores m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes irse en \nb\u00fasqueda de capacitaci\u00f3n extra y nuevas perspectivas, pero que tambi\u00e9n les genere expectativas para querer \nvolver. Y, por supuesto, un sistema que no deje de trabajar por una ley que garantice un crecimiento sostenido de la \ninversi\u00f3n en ciencia. Es el sistema que nos garantizar\u00e1 ser m\u00e1s fuertes y estar mejor preparados para dar respuestas \na las demandas de estos contextos.\nRespecto a las actividades espec\u00edficas del congreso, los invitamos a participar de los distintos espacios generados \npara compartir los resultados de nuestras investigaciones, incluyendo la plataforma de videoposters y sus respectivas \nsalas de discusi\u00f3n y el simposio donde presentar\u00e1n sus resultados los investigadores j\u00f3venes preseleccionados para \nal Premio SAFIS. Tambi\u00e9n a participar de la Conferencia SAFIS (a cargo del Dr. Guillermo Lehmann, Weill Cornell \nMedicine, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) enfocada en la discusi\u00f3n de la gen\u00f3mica de c\u00e9lulas individuales aplicada \na la biolog\u00eda ocular y al desarrollo de nuevas estrategias terap\u00e9uticas y del Simposio de Nutrici\u00f3n y Fitoterapia, en \nel que prestigiosas investigadoras de nuestro pa\u00eds y del exterior presentar\u00e1n y discutir\u00e1n sus estudios. Asimismo, la \ncomisi\u00f3n de Educaci\u00f3n de SAFIS organiz\u00f3 un simposio donde analizar con especialistas c\u00f3mo educar en tiempos \nde aislamiento social.\nLos alentamos a generar nuevos v\u00ednculos, a consultar, a contestar y a escuchar. Aguardando que en la pr\u00f3xima \noportunidad podamos encontrarnos presencialmente, y brindar por ello, los saludo afectuosamente.\nM.

A network of cell-cell \ncommunication through contact and soluble factors \nsupports the interaction of trophoblast cells with maternal \nvascular cells and leukocytes recruited to the decidua \nto sustain the varying demands of gestation. Deficient \nregulation of this interaction at early stages is associated \nwith pregnancy complications with high rates of maternal \nand neonatal morbidity and mortality. We propose that \nthe vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) synthesized \nby trophoblast cells has a central role in homeostasis \nmaintenance at the maternal-fetal interface. VIP regulates \ntrophoblast cell function and their interaction with \nmaternal vascular and immune cells through autocrine \nand paracrine loops. It increases migration, invasiveness \nand glucose and amino acid uptake by human \ncytotrophoblast cells. Interplay between VIP and mTOR \nin nutrient sensing and transport is observed. Invasive \ntrophoblast cells express VIP in human first trimester placental explants where it stimulates trophoblast \noutgrowth and modulates cytokine production by \nextravillous trophoblast cells, decidual macrophages and \nNK cells contributing to a tolerogenic microenvironment. \nMoreover, trophoblast cells and VIP inhibit neutrophil \nextracellular trap formation and favor a proangiogenic \nfunctional profile. A VIP-deficient pregnancy model in \nmice presents abnormal placental structure and lower \nfetal weight that is overcome by VIP treatment at early \nstages. In this model, VIP-deficient trophoblast cells \nexhibit reduced migration and invasiveness along with a \nlower expression of proangiogenic and antiinflammatory \nmarkers at the implantation sites. VIP treatment also \nimproves pregnancy outcome in two other murine \nmodels, the CBAxDBA and the non-obese diabetic mice. \nOur results point to the role of VIP in normal pregnancy \nand provide new clues for pharmacological targeting in \npregnancy complications associated with the disruption \nof placental homeostasis.\nSAIC CONFERENCE \u2018ALBERTO TAQUINI\u2019\nTRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH FOR HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA THERAPY, \nMANY FAILURES IN THE PAST, NEW CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES.\nGuillermo D. Mazzolini\nInstituto De Investigaciones en Medicina Traslacional (IIMT) Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas \n(CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex and \nheterogeneous malignancy, and is ranked as the 2nd \nleading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. \nUnfortunately, its incidence and mortality are steadily \nincreasing. HCC is a deadly disease, which is the \nconsequence of 2 dramatic facts: i) in 2018, 841,080 new \ncases were diagnosed, and 781,631 patients died, and ii) \nthe 5-year survival of patients with HCC is less than 18%. \nDespite advances in surgical and ablative techniques, the \nmajority of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages. \nPalliative treatments, namely multi-kinase inhibitors or, \nmore recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors, increase \npatient overall survival although only in a subset of \npatients. Therefore, it is of great urgency to develop new \nand more effective agents for HCC. Tumor heterogeneity \nin HCC, such as that found in second primary tumors \nafter curative treatment, synchronous multifocal tumors of different clonality, or intratumor heterogeneity, poses \na great therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Contrarily to \nother tumors such as breast cancer (e.g. HER-2 / neu) \nor colorectal carcinoma (e.g. K- ras) there are no \u201cdriver\u201d \nmutations that can be exploited therapeutically in HCC. \nOn the other hand, HCC is a unique malignancy, as the \nmajority of patients have underlying cirrhosis. As such, \nthe treatment consideration should not only look at the \noncological perspective but also the functional status \nof the liver. Over the lasts 15 years, our laboratory was \nfocused on developing a platform for testing molecular \nand cellular therapeutic strategies, using a translational \napproach. We have generated HCC models for \ntranslational drug development using in vitro and in vivo  \nexperiments. Using our models, we have studied different \ntherapeutic strategies for HCC such as gene therapy \nwith immunostimulatory cytokines, remodeling of the LECTURES                                                                                 MEDICINA (Buenos Aires) 2020; 80 (Supl.

Importantly, we \nhave incorporated bioinformatic analysis of HCC patients \ntranscriptional and genomic data to corroborate the role of the targets tested in our lab models, and to generate a \nnew multigene signature associated with patient survival. \nFinally, we have identified and developed a number of \ninnovative treatments with potential for a future clinical \ndevelopment.\nSAIC HONOR LECTURE TO DR. ROBERTO COCCO\nEXPERIENCE WITH 1000 PROSPECTIVE CASES OF NON-INVASIVE PRENATAL TESTING \nFOR ANEUPLOIDY SCREENING AND THE REPORTING OF RARE TRISOMIES, MONOSOMY X \nAND MICRODELETIONS.  \nI Canonero; G M\u00e9jico; C Rohr; B Brun; D Llarrull; AL Ruggieri; E Nazzi; D Pereyra; F Fay; MP V\u00e1zquez.  \nHERITAS, Ocampo 210 bis, Rosario, Argentina  \nIntroduction: Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for \naneuploidy screening has become first line of testing \nin many countries for pregnant women independent of \nthe risk and age, mainly due to its high sensitivity and \nspecificity for chromosomes 21, 18 and 13. However, \nmany laboratories around the world report other \nchromosomes aneuplodies, monosomy X and even \nmicrodeletions / microduplications, not following ACMG \nand other international guidance. We developed the first \nnon-invasive prenatal test in Argentina and hereby we \nreport our experience with 1000 cases.  Results: We \nused a cut-off of 3% fetal fractions. Prospective analysis \nof 1000 samples detected a total of 88 aneuploidies \ndistributed as following: trisomy 21 (49 cases), trisomy \n18 (17 cases), trisomy 13 (4 cases), Monosomy X (8 \ncases) and other rare trisomies in chromosomes 6, 7, 9, \n14, 15, 22 (10 cases). All the detected cases presented \nultrasound findings or altered biochemical markers and were confirmed by invasive testing. There was a single \nfalse negative, which resulted in a triploidy, a known \nlimitation of NIPT. There was a single false positive related \nto monosomy X. Three abnormalities were confined \nto the placenta, 2 suspected cases were confirmed as \nplacental mosaics. The non-result rate due to low fetal \nfraction was 2,53 %. To obtain better accuracy while \nreporting monosomy X, we introduced several changes \nin our pipeline that yielded a correct result during the re-\nanalysis of the single false positive in this prospective \ncohort. We also developed an improved version of our \npipeline of circular binary segmentation to report putative \nmicrodeletions/microduplications. However, we observed \nseveral issues during the reporting of these anomalies \nrelated to interpretations and confirmation of the results \nby invasive testing. On the other hand, we did not observe \naccuracy problems in reporting rare trisomies since all of \nthem were confirmed by invasive testing.  \nSAIC HONOR LECTURE TO DR. ELVIRA ARRIZURIETA\nBEHAVIOR OF THE RENAL KALLIKREIN KININ SYSTEM (RKKS). INFLUENCE OF SEXUAL HORMONES \nAND ALDOSTERONE SENSITIVE DISTAL NEPHRON ION CHANNELS.\nElisabet Oddo\nLaboratorio de Nefrolog\u00eda Experimental y Bioqu\u00edmica Molecular. Instituto de Investigaciones M\u00e9dicas A. Lanari, \nFacultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires. \nThe renal kallikrein-kinin system (RKKS) has long been \nrelated with blood pressure control and sodium and water \nbalance but how the gene expression, tissue kallikrein \nactivity and urinary kallikrein release are regulated still \nremain to be established.\nPrevious results obtained in our laboratory, have shown \nthat female rats (F) have a high urinary kallikrein activity \n(UKa) and a little lower blood pressure (BP) than male \n(M) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). \nThrough studies in adult Wistar rats of either sex, with and \nwithout gonadectomy (Gx), we showed that ovariectomy \n(oVx) stimulates urinary kallikrein activity (UKa) and \ndiminishes BP.  Also, RKKS blockade increased BP \nexclusively in the oVx group.  The renal kallikrein content \n(RK) and UKa were higher in F than in M rats.  After Gx, \nRK increased and UKa showed a similar pattern. Renal klk1 mRNA levels did not show gender difference in non-\nGx rats, but an increase after oVx was observed. \nUnder normal salt intake, renal Na+ excretion in oVx rats \nwas equal to that in intact female (IF) while BP was slightly \nlower but, when IF and oVx were subjected to high salt \nintake the pattern of response to salt loading differed in \nboth groups. oVx rats have a lower Na+ excretion and a \nhigher BP than IF. \nAdditionally, we also showed that high K+ intake and \nGx diminish BP with a concomitant increase in UKa \nand plasma aldosterone levels in SHR, revealing a link \nbetween those systems. Since kallikrein co-localize \nin the same distal nephron segments of aldosterone \neffectors, we explored the blockage of aldosterone, \nepithelial Na+ (ENaC) and the rectifying outer medulla K+ \n(ROMK) channels upon the RKKS behavior in different MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 202016\ngonad contexts. \nSpironolactone increased RK in all groups. Likewise, \ninhibition of mRNA synthesis and UK release were \nobserved, except in intact males. ENaC inhibition \nincreased RK without changes in klk1 mRNA and UKa \nlevels. UKa correlated with urinary K+ and a decrease \nin BP was observed without changes in urine Na+/K+. \nROMK blockage only shows effects by increasing the mRNA levels and RK in M while orchidectomized, but not \noVx, tends to increase UKa and showed the lowest urine \nNa+/K+.\nWe concluded that RKKS regulation showed a sexual \ndimorphism and seems to be modulated by sex hormones \nthroughout a process that involved aldosterone and its \nsensitive-ion channels.\nSAI CONFERENCES\nIMAGING IMMUNITY: DEVELOPING A DEEP SPATIO-TEMPORAL UNDERSTANDING \nOF HOST DEFENSE AND TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS\nGermain, Ronald N.1, Zhao, Chen1,2, Uderhardt, Stefan1,3, Yu, Weiming1, Hassan, Raffit2, Thakur, Nishant1, Grant, Spencer1, \nBeuschel, Rebecca1, Chu, Colin1, Speranza, Emily1, Park, Kyemyung1, Tsang, John1, Radtke, Andrea1, Wong, Harikesh1\n1Laboratory of Immune System Biology, NIAID, NIH; 2CCR, National Cancer Institute, NIH; 3Dept. Medicine, Univ. Hospital, \nErlangen, Germany\nBackground:  Immune responses involve cell-cell inter -\nactions within lymphoid tissues, trafficking of activated \ncells to sites of effector function, and the migration of ef -\nfector cells within peripheral tissues including tumors. To \ngain insight into the relationships among cell movement, \norgan architecture, immune function, and the local tissue \nenvironment, we have used intravital multiphoton micros -\ncopy and novel multiplex immunohistochemical methods \nwe have developed called Histo-cytometry, IBEX, and \nCe3D. \nObservations:  The role of cell localization in both in -\nnate and adaptive immunity has been addressed using \nHisto-cytometry in combination with a new clarification \nmethod called Ce3D. These techniques allow the use \nof 8-12 different antibodies not only to surface markers \nbut to phospho-proteins and cytokines in each cycle \nof imaging. Together with new methods for rapid itera -\ntion of staining and analysis developed in our laborato -ry  (IBEX), these methods permit imaging of >60 target \nproteins in a single tissue slice in a quantitative manner. \nRecent advances include combining RNA FISH with anti -\nbody-based staining to take advantage of RNA-seq data. \nThese multiplex imaging technologies in conjunction with \nnew computational tools facilitate analysis of the pheno -\ntype, number, location, signaling state, and function of \nimmune cells and stromal elements in infected, inflamed, \nor tumor sites.  \nConclusion:  This talk will illustrate the power of in situ \nimaging for the acquisition of a more accurate picture \nof the molecular, cellular, spatial, and temporal aspects \nof cell function and signaling events in host immune re -\nsponses and cancer, and the use of new deep learning \nmethods for evaluating the high content data these imag -\ning tools provide. \nThis work was supported by the Intramural Research \nProgram of the NIH, NIAID.\nTHE HUMAN ANTIBODY RESPONSE\nMichel Nussenzweig\nThe Rockefeller University; USA\nDr. Nussenzweig will speak about the development of \nantibody responses focusing on neutralizing antibody \nresponses to SARS-CoViD-2. Over a decade ago, the \nNussenzweig laboratory developed methods for rapid \nantibody cloning from humans in order to understand hu -\nmoral immune responses to pathogens beginning with \nHIV-1. These methods have been widely adapted by oth -\ners facilitating antibody cloning for multiple human patho -gens and their clinical development. At the start of the \nCoViD-19 pandemic a group of 148 individuals that had \nrecovered from SARS-CoViD-2 infection were recruited \nto Rockefeller University to give blood for analysis. The \nlecture will summarize features of their humoral immune \nresponse in these individuals and their neutralizing prop -\nerties in vitro and in animal models. LECTURES17\nMULTIPLE ROLES OF PHOSPHOINOSITIDES IN PHAGOCYTOSIS AND MACROPINOCYTOSIS\nSergio Grinstein\nProgram in Cell Biology, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Hospital for Sick Children, 686 Bay Street, 19-9800, \nToronto, ON, M5G 0A4, Canada.\nCells of the innate immune system actively survey their \nenvironment for signs of infection or damage.  To this \nend, they sample their surrounding milieu by macropino -\ncytosis and engulf foreign particles and apoptotic cells \nby phagocytosis.  Phosphoinositides play critical roles at \ndifferent stages of these processes.  The conference will \nconsist of two parts: 1) an analysis of the dynamic cyto -skeletal changes that drive phagosome formation and 2) \nthe maturation of macropinosomes, with emphasis on the \ndisposition of their contents and the generation of tubu -\nlar structures.  The detection, metabolism and signaling \nroles of PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,5)P2 \nin these processes will be highlighted.\nSAI HONOR LECTURE TO DR. LEONARDO SATZ \nTARGETING TREGS IN DISEASE: A TRANSLATIONAL APPROACH\nEliane Piaggio\nTranslational Immunotherapy Team, U932, Institut Curie, Paris, Francia\nCD25+ CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) maintain \nself-tolerance and homeostasis of the immune system, \nbut also dampen anti-tumor immunity. So, understand -\ning their biology and function represent the holly grail for \nimmunologists. In mouse models, manipulation of Tregs \nhas given impressive results, however, their therapeutic \napplication in medicine is still at the level of experimental \nresearch. What has precluded translation into the clinic? \ni) the difficulty in identifying unique Treg markers;  ii) the \nfact that Tregs from different tissues represent a highly \nheterogeneous population shaped by microenvironmen -\ntal cues; and iii) the inflammatory milieu associated to \ndifferent pathologies can distinctly affect the Treg mo -\nlecular profile and associated functions. Consequently, \nto efficiently manipulate Tregs for therapeutic aims, it is \nmandatory to understand the unique Treg traits associat -\ned to each pathology.\nInformation on cancer-associated Treg biology in hu -\nmans is limited. Few RNAseq analyses of Tregs purified \nfrom human cancers have been performed, and helped \nto define a tumor-Treg-specific signature and correlation with patient\u2019s survival. Notwithstanding, immune mod -\nulation of an immune response occurs not only during \nthe effector T cell phase in the tumor bed, but also, at \nthe level of T-cell priming in the tumor-draining lymph \nnodes (LNs). Thus, Tregs present in the LNs will largely \nshape the quality of the anti-tumoral T-cell response. The \nproperties of the Tregs residing in human LNs remain \nlargely undefined. During the last years, our team has \nbeen studying the function and molecular characteristics \nof human Tregs present in the blood, LNs and tumors \nof breast and lung cancer patients. We have carried out \nmultiparametric high-dimensional analyses of Tregs from \nthe three locations, including coupled single-cell tran -\nscriptome/TCR RNAseq analysis. We have observed an \nunprecedented heterogeneity and functional diversi -\nty among Treg cells, and identified a unique molecular \nsignature of clonally expanded tumor-enriched Tregs, \nincluding known and novel molecular targets. Next step \nis the translation of our results to novel approaches spe -\ncifically targeting tumor-associated Tregs, and sparing all \nbody Tregs, avoiding generalized immunosuppression.\nSAFIS CONFERENCE\nSINGLE-CELL TRANSCRIPTOMICS IN THE STUDY OF OCULAR BIOLOGY AND DISEASE.\nGuillermo Lehmann\nMargaret Dyson Vision Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., \nTarrytown, NY.\nThe choroid is a highly vascularized layer of the eye lo -\ncalized between the sclera and the outermost retinal lay -\ner, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Blood supplied \nby choroidal circulation is the main source of oxygen \nand nutrients for the RPE and photoreceptors (rods and \ncones), as well as the main evacuation route for retinal \nwaste. On the other hand, the RPE provides essential \nsupport functions for photoreceptor homeostasis and vi -\nsual function. Thus, it is not surprising that RPE/choroid alterations are associated with secondary photorecep -\ntor death in a number of blinding ophthalmic diseases, \nincluding age-related macular degeneration (AMD).  Al -\nthough chronic inflammation of RPE/choroid tissue is be -\nlieved to be central to the disease, AMD etiology remains \nunknown due to lack of information on RPE/choroid cell \ndiversity and intercellular crosstalk mechanisms. Hence, \nthere is urgent scientific and medical need for systematic \nRPE/choroid studies that characterize in molecular de -MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 202018\ntail the different cell types and crosstalk signaling mech -\nanisms that regulate choroid and retinal homeostasis. \nAs a first step, we produced a single cell RNAseq atlas \nof rodent RPE/choroid tissue and defined the molecular \nsignature of 13 cell types in the RPE/choroid, and identi -\nfied transcriptionally-distinct cell subtypes within stromal, \nhematopoietic and endothelial cells (ECs). By combining \nour scRNAseq data with the analysis of tissue-specific \nECs by RNAseq, we provide for the first time a list of \nchoroid EC \u2018 signature genes \u2019 and their relative expres -\nsion within choroid EC subtypes. Compared to ECs from \nother tissues, we found that Ihh expression was highly \nenriched in choroid ECs, in particular in the ECs that con -\nstitute the choriocapillaris, a highly fenestrated microvas -\ncular bed located in close apposition to the RPE. This \nexciting observation lead us to further explore the poten -\ntial role of Ihh in the adult eye. By using a reporter mouse line, we identified the target of choroidal Hedgehog sig -\nnaling as a large population of stromal, GLI1+ perivascu -\nlar cells with mesenchymal stem cell properties. By using \ntwo distinct transgenic adult mouse lines we observed \nthat Ihh deletion reduced choroidal expression levels of \nseveral mast cell genes consistent with the loss of cho -\nroidal mast cells. We also found that EC-specific Ihh de -\nletion significantly reduced molecular markers of alterna -\ntively-activated M2 macrophages. Finally, we found that \nin a context of tissue damage, EC-specific Ihh deletion \nresults in an exacerbated inflammatory response in the \nRPE/choroid and neural retina that correlates with a more \nsevere visual function impairment . In summary, our find -\nings increase our understanding of the eye choroid at the \nmolecular and cellular level and decipher key choroidal \nintercellular crosstalk mechanisms that immunomodulate \neye inflammatory processes. SYMPOSIA19\nSAIC SYMPOSIUM: MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE TRANSPORTERS. INVOLVEMENT IN PHYSIOPATHOLOGICAL \nPROCESSES .\nMULTIDRUG TRANSPORTER MRP4/ABCC4 AS A KEY DETERMINANT \nOF PANCREATIC CANCER AGGRESSIVENESS\nCarlos A. Davio \nInstituto de Investigaciones Farmacol\u00f3gicas (ININFA\u2011UBA\u2011CONICET), Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, \nUniversidad de Buenos Aires, Jun\u00edn 956, C1113AAD Buenos Aires, Argentina. \nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the \nmost lethal human malignancies, due to its late diagno -\nsis, inherent resistance to treatment and early dissemi -\nnation. This type of tumor is expected to become the sec -\nond leading cause of cancer mortality by the year 2030 \nand has limited therapeutic options. Even after the devel -\nopment of new targeted agents and the use of multiple \ntherapeutic combinations, there is no clear benefit for this \ndisease. Recent findings from our laboratory show that \nMRP4 is critical for PDAC cell proliferation. Neverthe -\nless, the significance of MRP4 protein levels and func -\ntion in PDAC progression is still unclear. Bioinformatic \nstudies revealed that PDAC samples show higher MRP4 \ntranscript levels compared to normal adjacent pancreatic \ntissue and circulating tumor cells express higher levels \nof MRP4 than primary tumors. Also, high levels of MRP4 \nare typical of high-grade PDAC cell lines and associate \nwith an epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype. Moreover, \nPDAC patients with high levels of MRP4 depict dysregu -lation of pathways associated with migration, chemotaxis \nand cell adhesion. Silencing MRP4 in PANC1 cells re -\nduced tumorigenicity and tumor growth and impaired cell \nmigration. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that MRP4 \nsilencing alters PANC1 gene expression, mainly dysreg -\nulating pathways related to cell-to-cell interactions and \nfocal adhesion. Contrarily, overexpression of MRP4 in \nBxPC-3 cells produced a switch in the expression of EMT \nmarkers, significantly increased tumor growth, and en -\nhanced experimental metastatic incidence. Overall, our \nfindings indicate that MRP4 upregulation could represent \nan adaptive advantage associated with poor prognosis, \nevidenced by the co-expression of mesenchymal mark -\ners, higher cell proliferation, tumorigenicity and invasive -\nness in PDAC models. Thus, we provide theoretical and \nexperimental support for targeted treatment of pancreatic \ncancer by making an important contribution to the under -\nstanding of pancreatic tumor cell biology. \nMOLECULAR MECHANISM OF THIRD-GENERATION P-GLYCOPROTEIN INHIBITORS\nGuillermo A. Altenberg\nDepartment of Cell Physiology and Molecular Biophysics\nSchool of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas, USA\nThe multidrug resistance protein P-glycoprotein is an \nATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporter pump that has two \nnucleotide-binding domains that bind and hydrolyze ATP, \nand two transmembrane domains that contain a polyspe -\ncific drug-binding pocket. Transport of drugs by P-glyco -\nprotein makes this protein an important pharmacological \ntarget. ATP-driven association of the nucleotide-binding \ndomains into tight dimers and their dissociation that \nfollows ATP hydrolysis control the accessibility of the \nbinding pocket and lead to substrate transport (alternat -\ning access model). Binding of substrates and inhibitors \naffects P-glycoprotein ATPase activity, but the nature of \nthe long-distance conformational changes that occur on \nthe nucleotide-binding domains side in response to drug \nbinding to the transmembrane domains has not been es -\ntablished. We used luminescence (or lanthanide-based) resonance energy transfer (LRET) to study P-glycopro -\ntein reconstituted in nanodiscs and determined the ef -\nfects of the substrates verapamil, valinomycin and taxol, \nand the third-generation inhibitors tariquidar and zosuqui -\ndar. LRET is a highly sensitive spectroscopic technique \nthat allows the study of conformational changes with \nangstrom resolution of functional membrane proteins in \na lipid bilayer membrane environment at physiological \ntemperature. We identified distinct nucleotide-binding \ndomains conformational changes that can explain the \nstimulation of ATPase activity by substrates and the in -\nhibition by tariquidar and zosuquidar. We propose that \nthese inhibitors act by preventing the formation of a tight \nnucleotide-binding domain dimer and that their inhibition \nrequires P-glycoprotein to go through at least one hydro -\nlysis event.SYMPOSIA                                                                                   MEDICINA (Buenos Aires) 2020; 80 (Supl.

Schuetz3, and Jos\u00e9 E Manautou1\n1 Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, 06269, USA.\n2 Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, 06269, USA.\n3 Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA.\nMultidrug resistance protein 4 (Mrp4) is an efflux trans -\nporter known to transport several xenobiotics and endog -\nenous molecules. We recently identified that the lack of \nMrp4 increases adipose tissue and body weights in mice. \nHowever, the role of Mrp4 in adipose tissue physiology \nis unknown. Here we present recent studies aimed at \ncharacterizing these roles of Mrp4 using wildtype (WT) \nand knockout (Mrp4-/-) mice. Our investigations showed \nthat Mrp4 is expressed in mouse adipose tissue and that \nthe lack of Mrp4 expression is associated with adipocyte \nhypertrophy. Furthermore, absence of Mrp4 increases \nblood glucose and leptin levels, and impairs glucose tol -\nerance. Additionally, in 3T3-L1 cells and human pre-ad -ipocytes, pharmacological inhibition of Mrp4 increased \nadipogenesis in association with altered expression of \nadipogenic genes. Lack of Mrp4 activity in both of in vivo \nand in vitro experiments leads to increased activation of \nadipose tissue cAMP response element-binding protein \n(Creb) and decreased plasma prostaglandin E (PGE) \nmetabolite levels. The combined effect of Creb activation \nand reduced PGE levels promoted the observed meta -\nbolic phenotype in Mrp4-/- mice. Our collective findings \nled us to the conclusion that Mrp4 is as a novel genetic \nfactor that contributes to the pathogenesis of metabolic \ndiseases, such as obesity and diabetes.\nSAIC SYMPOSIUM: MITOCHONDRIA, STRESS AND METABOLIC DISORDERS\nFROM INSULIN RESISTANCE TO NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE: \nNEW EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES\nAngela M\u00aa Mart\u00ednez Valverde\nInstituto de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas Alberto Sols (CSIC\u2011UAM), Madrid, Espa\u00f1a.\nCentro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Diabetes y Enfermedades Metab\u00f3licas Asociadas (CIBERDEM), \nInstituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Espa\u00f1a.\nThe liver is a major contributor in the regulation of glu -\ncose homeostasis by maintaining blood glucose levels \nwithin the normal range. In obesity, excessive caloric \nintake, adipose tissue inflammation and elevated he -\npatic oxidative stress expose the liver to hyper-afflux \nof free fatty acids and excessive accumulation of lipid \nmetabolites, ultimately increasing the risk of insulin re -\nsistance-associated conditions including type 2 diabetes \nmellitus (T2DM) and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease \n(NAFLD). As such, these diseases belong to the termed \nreferred as non-communicable diseases. As a vicious \ncircle, once NAFLD is established it boots the hepatic \ninsulin resistance, which, in turn, triggers evolution of the \ndisease towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), \nfibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure and, ultimately, hepatocel -\nlular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD also promotes systemic \nlow-grade inflammation and impairs insulin sensitivity in other tissues and relevant organs for metabolic control. \nNAFLD increases the risk of T2DM and diabetes\u2019 com -\nplications and is fully considered as an independent risk \nfactor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the \nlast decade, NAFLD has become the most common \nchronic liver disease worldwide. At present, there are no \napproved pharmacological treatments for this patholog -\nical condition, therefore identifying molecular pathways \nwhere the hits leading to NAFLD converge represents \nthe first step for designing an effective targeted treat -\nment. In this conference, an overview of the molecular \nmechanisms leading from insulin resistance to NASH, an \nemerging role of oval (progenitor) liver cells in lipotoxicity \nduring NAFLD and new therapeutic approaches based \non dual agonism of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and \nglucagon receptors will be presented.\nMITOCHONDRIA-DEPENDENT MECHANISMS IN TISSUE DAMAGE TRIGGERED BY AIR POLLUTION\nEvelson P , Marchini T, Magnani N, C\u00e1ceres L, Calabr\u00f3 V, Garc\u00e9s M.\nUniversidad de Buenos Aires. CONICET. Instituto de Bioqu\u00edmica y Medicina Molecular (IBIMOL), \nFacultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica. Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, 9 out of 10 \npeople worldwide breathe low-quality air. Consequently, \nmore than 9 million premature deaths occur every year \ndue to the effects of ambient air pollution exposure. Re -cently, it has been estimated that the exposure to pollut -\ned air in urban environments reduces life expectancy by \nalmost 3 years globally. Increased incidence of respirato -\nry diseases, such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pul -SYMPOSIA21\nmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer, is frequently \nassociated with air pollution exposure. However, cardio -\nvascular diseases largely account for most of the increase \nin morbidity and mortality rates. In fact, according to the \nGlobal Burden of Disease study, air pollution is responsi -\nble for one-fourth of the total death count from ischemic \nheart disease and stroke. Besides the well demonstrated \ntoxicity of air pollution gaseous components, epidemio -\nlogical studies indicate that particulate matter (PM) is the \nmain responsible for pollution exposure adverse effects. \nPM derived from anthropogenic emissions is a complex \nmixture of particles of variable sizes and chemical com -\nposition. Motor vehicle emissions and fossil fuel combus -\ntion during industrial processes and power generation \nare the main sources of PM in urban areas, as a result \nfrom incomplete oxidation of carbonaceous materials.\nFollowing PM inhalation, the activation of oxidative stress \nand inflammatory pathways largely account for PM bio -\nlogical effects, both locally as well as systemically and \nin secondary organs, such as the heart and brain. In the \nlung, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in -\ncluding interleukin (IL) -1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-6, \nand monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, are a frequent \nfinding after PM exposure. Therefore, lung inflammatory \ncell recruitment is usually observed following PM expo -\nsure, both in humans and in different animal models. In -\ncreased plasma levels of these inflammatory mediators \nare a common finding, indicating that PM exposure trig -\ngers an inflammatory response that is not only confined \nto the lung, but is also systemic. As a result, metabolism \nis impaired in distant organs.\nWe and others have studied the role of the exposure to \nair pollution PM over lung and heart redox metabolism, in \nwhich altered mitochondrial respiration together with en -\nhanced NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) activity plays a cen -\ntral role as shown. Interestingly, NOX2 seems to account \nfor increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production \nin the lung following PM exposure, while mitochondri -\nal mild uncoupling, characterized as increased oxygen \nconsumption rate and decreased inner membrane po -\ntential, together with decreased ATP production rate and \nlower efficiency of the oxidative phosphorylation process \n(lower P/O ratio), may prevent further ROS release from \nthis organelle. When increasing electron transport rate \nat the respiratory chain complexes, mitochondrial ROS \nproduction is attenuated by different mechanisms: First, \nmitochondria can significantly reduce O2.- production by \ndecreasing oxygen tension in the mitochondrial micro -\nenvironment; Second, by favoring more oxidized levels \nof respiratory chain intermediates; Third, by lowering \nNADH levels that could be used by mitochondrial ma -\ntrix flavoenzymes; Forth, by preventing reverse electron \ntransfer due to lower membrane potential.\nAlveolar macrophages play a central role in maintaining \nlung homeostasis through the removal of exogenous ma -\nterials and microorganisms from the respiratory surface \nby phagocytosis, including PM. However, PM usually \noverwhelms cell capacity for foreign material removal, \nleading to uncontrolled cell activation and ROS produc -tion, as well as an exaggerated inflammatory response \nand pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Activation of \nthe NLRP3 inflammasome following PM uptake seems \nto represent a central step in the cellular inflammatory \nresponse to PM in alveolar macrophages. Interestingly, \nPM has been also shown to accumulate inside mitochon -\ndria, suggesting a specific direct effect of PM over this \norganelle. Accordingly, PM exposure induces altered \nmitochondrial ultrastructure in alveolar macrophages, \nincluding swelling, cristae disorder, and organelle frag -\nmentation at high doses, as well as modulation of mi -\ntochondrial fission/fusion gene expression. In an exper -\nimental model tested in our laboratory, an increased \nmitochondrial production of O2\u2981- in intact cells exposed \nto PM was measured, which may be a consequence of \nimpaired mitochondrial function. These findings suggest \nthat mitochondria are important mediators in the events \nthat follow PM exposure in macrophages. Interestingly, \nrecently published evidence suggests that mitochondria \nare not only a source of ROS, but also a target of oxida -\ntive damage in the context of PM exposure. In this sense, \nthe relevance of NOX2 as a source of O2\u2981- in inflamma -\ntory macrophages is suggested, which encouraged the \nsearch for such contribution in this model. Indeed, an in -\ncrease in NOX activity was found, which may contribute \nto the development of a crosstalk between the observed \noxidative response and mitochondrial dysfunction. Con -\nsidering these findings, it is proposed that mitochondria \nand NOX are the main sources of O2\u2981-, which is converted \ninto H2O2 by superoxide dismutase, and ultimately acts \nas an effector molecule in redox signaling and oxidative \ndamage to macromolecules, following PM exposure in \nmacrophages.\nImpaired cardiac mitochondrial function also arises as \na central feature of air pollution PM toxicology. Mecha -\nnistically, an acute exposure to PM induces a decrease \nin active, but not rest, state oxygen consumption rate, \ntogether with inner membrane depolarization and re -\nduced mitochondrial ATP production. Consequently, de -\nficient contractile and lusitropic reserve is observed in \nPM-exposed mice, as the heart fails to properly increase \ncardiac contractility after a \u03b2-adrenergic stimulus with \nisoproterenol. Blunted mitochondrial ATP supply in mice \nbreathing PM may account for this effect, as decreased \nATP levels are a frequent finding in the failing heart. Inter -\nestingly, this cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunc -\ntion seems to be partially mediated by an inflammatory \nresponse triggered by PM exposure, since impaired mi -\ntochondrial respiration and cardiac contractility is attenu -\nated by pretreatment with a chimeric anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody \n(Infliximab) in PM-exposed mice.\nThe central nervous system is also a target of air pollu -\ntion, causing tissue damage and functional alterations, \nwith oxidative stress and neuroinflammation as possi -\nble mechanisms mediating these effects. Glutathione \nlevels, assessed as GSH/GSSG ratio, were found to be \ndecreased in cerebral cortex after exposure to urban \nair, and at later time points in the olfactory bulb (OB). \nActivation of NOX was also observed. Increased GFAP MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 202022\nexpression levels showed reactive astrocytes in OB, \nprobably associated with the altered olfactory function \nobserved by a behavioral test. Interestingly, impaired mi -\ntochondrial function, due to reduction in O2 consumption \nin active state, a decrease in ATP production rate and \nan increase of H2O2 production was found, accompanied \nby decreased activities of the respiratory complexes I-III \nand II-III.\nTaken together, impaired mitochondrial respiration, en -hanced ROS release, and deficient ATP supply, play a \ncentral role in the adverse health effects reported after air \npollution PM exposure in the lungs and distant organs, \nsuch as the heart and brain. In this context, the mod -\nulation of mitochondrial function (e.g. by mitochondrial \ntargeted antioxidants) arises as a potential therapeutic \ntarget to prevent excessive lung inflammatory response, \nas well as the alterations observed in cardiac and brain \ntissues in PM-exposed individuals at particular high risk.\nROLE OF CYCLOOXYGENASE 2 IN LIVER PATHOPHYSIOLOGY.\nMarta Casado-Pinna.\nInstituto de Biomedicina, Valencia, Espa\u00f1a\nCyclooxygenase (COX) is the enzyme that catalyzes \nthe limiting step in prostanoid synthesis. Prostaglandins \nplay an important role in numerous biological processes \nsuch as platelet aggregation, maintenance of the gas -\ntric mucosa, reproduction, etc. and also in pathological \nprocesses such as inflammation and cancer. COX-2 is \nexpressed and induced by different stimuli in various tis -\nsues and cell types, but in the hepatocyte its expression \nis limited to those pathophysiological situations that lead \nto cell dedifferentiation, regeneration or proliferation. \nThrough the use of cell models and transgenic mice, our \ngroup has shown that COX-2 expression in hepatocytes \nprotects against hyperglycemia-induced liver damage, \ninsulin resistance and obesity, as well as steatohepatitis \nand fibrosis suggesting an improvement in mitochondri -al function and oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, \nCOX-2-dependent prostaglandins protect against dam -\nage induced by liver ischemia/reperfusion due to atten -\nuation in inflammation, oxidative stress and liver apop -\ntosis, an increase in autophagic flow, and a decrease in \nendoplasmic reticulum stress. Measurement of plasma \nPGE2 levels from patients undergoing liver transplanta -\ntion revealed a significantly positive correlation of PGE2 \nlevels and graft function, and an inverse correlation with \nischemia time. Taking all these data into account, we \nhypothesized that COX-2 induction plays a protective \nrole as a physiological response against liver injury. We \nbelieve that PGs are important actors in the observed \nprocesses, and that local relative concentrations are de -\ncisive for the hepatoprotective effect.\nTHE AMAZING WORLD OF RNA BINDING PROTEINS REGULATING THE MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION\nAna J Fern\u00e1ndez-Alvarez\nLaboratorio de Biolog\u00eda Celular del RNA. Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Leloir \u2013 Buenos Aires \u2013 Argentina\nTranslational control is essential for proper eukary -\notic protein expression and so mRNA metabolism and \nfunction must be finely regulated at different levels. The \nmodulation of mRNA nuclear export, stability, rate of \ntranslation, and localization is regulated by RNA binding \nproteins (RBPs) that therefore determine the final amount \nof synthesized proteins. Some RBPs are essential for the \nfunction of all cellular mRNAs, while others control a sub -\nset of transcripts coding for proteins implicated in distinc -\ntive processes. RBPs make up assemblies denominated \nmembrane-less organelles (MLOs) which concentrate \nspace and temporarily the mRNA molecules necessary \nto perform a specific function.\nMitochondria are dynamic and plastic organelles, which \nflexibly adapt morphology, ATP production, and metabol -\nic function to meet extrinsic challenges and demands. In \nthe last decade, the posttranscriptional regulation of the \nexpression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins \nhas emerged as a fast, flexible, and powerful mechanism \nto shape mitochondrial function and coordinate it with \nother cellular processes. In fact, several recent studies have highlighted that the fate of mRNAs encoding mito -\nchondrial proteins is dictated by RBPs that orchestrates \nmitochondrial function during physiological and patholog -\nical conditions.\nIn our laboratory we have implicated human RBP Smaug \nin the regulation of mitochondrial function. Smaug is a \nconserved translational repressor that recognizes spe -\ncific RNA motifs present in a large number of mRNAs, \nincluding nuclear transcripts that encode mitochondrial \nenzymes and forms cytosolic MLOs in several organisms \nand cell types. We demonstrated that the loss of Smaug \nfunction affects mitochondrial activity and mitochondrial \nnetwork morphology. Single molecule FISH reveal that \ntranscripts that encode SDHB and Uqcrc1 associate with \nSmaug MLOs. In addition, defective Smaug MLO forma -\ntion affects mitochondrial activity. Finally, rotenone and \nmetformin but not the uncoupler CCCP rapidly induce \nSmaug MLO dissolution and the release of bounded mR -\nNAs. We propose that Smaug MLOs respond to changes \nin the energetic metabolism to coordinate the expression \nof mRNAs that encode key mitochondrial proteins.SYMPOSIA23\nSAIC HONOR SYPOSIUM TO DR HORACIO A.

Cubillos-Ruiz\nWeill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University, New York, United States.\nMalignant cells utilize diverse strategies that enable \nthem to thrive under adverse conditions while simulta -\nneously inhibiting the development of anti-tumor immune \nresponses. Hostile microenvironmental conditions with -\nin tumor masses, such as nutrient deprivation, oxygen \nlimitation, high metabolic demand and oxidative stress \ndisturb the protein folding capacity of the Endoplasmic \nReticulum (ER), thereby provoking a cellular state of \u201cER \nstress\u201d. Sustained activation of ER stress sensors en -dows malignant cells with greater tumorigenic, metastat -\nic and drug resistant capacity. Additionally, recent studies \nhave uncovered that ER stress responses further impede \nthe development of anti-cancer immunity by manipulat -\ning the function of immune cells in the tumor microenvi -\nronment.  This seminar will describe the major immuno -\nregulatory effects of ER stress in cancer and will highlight \nthe significant immunotherapeutic potential of targeting \nER stress response pathways to eliminate tumors.\nCHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA: THE EFFECT OF NOVEL THERAPEUTIC AGENTS \nON THE LEUKEMIC CLONE AND NON-MALIGNANT CELLS.\nRomina Gamberale.\n Laboratorio de Inmunolog\u00eda Oncol\u00f3gica, IMEX\u2011CONICET \u2011ANM, CABA, Argentina.\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common \nadult leukemia in western countries. It is characterized \nby the presence of malignant B cells in peripheral blood \nand lymphoid tissues. The approval of multiple new tar -\ngeted agents has allowed important advances in thera -\npeutic management of CLL patients, improving clinical \noutcomes and quality of life. However, CLL is still an in -\ncurable disease. Lymphoid tissues act as survival niches, \nwhere leukemic cells receive signals through the B cell \nreceptor (BCR) and signals from non-malignant cells that \nfavor leukemic cell accumulation. Our group has been \nworking with different novel therapeutic agents for CLL \npatients: inhibitors of the BCR-associated kinases (BCR-\nKIs), and the selective BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax. We \nfirst confirmed that peripheral blood leukemic cells from \nCLL patients are very sensitive to venetoclax in vitro in \na dose-dependent manner, while T cells, NK cells, and \nmonocytes are less sensitive to the drug. We also found that CLL cells that have received survival signals from \nthe tumor microenvironment, such as those triggered \nby autologous activated T cells, are less responsive to \nvenetoclax due to the upregulation of anti-apoptotic pro -\nteins MCL-1 or BCL-XL, which are not targeted by the \ndrug. Venetoclax-resistant leukemic cells are character -\nized by high levels of activation and proliferation mark -\ners, increased PD-1 expression and show resistance to \na second treatment with the drug. Finally, we found that \nBCR-KIs entospletinib and idelalisib by impairing T cell \nactivation, prevent the generation of CLL cells with an \naggressive phenotype and, more importantly, completely \nrestore the sensitivity to venetoclax.  Altogether, these in \nvitro evidences highlight the relevance of the tumor mi -\ncroenvironment in the generation of venetoclax-resistant \nCLL cells  and provide an interesting rationale for combin -\ning venetoclax with entospletinib or idelalisib to reduce \nthe emergence of drug resistance in vivo .\nPRACTICAL BIOINFORMATICS IN ONCO/IMMUNOGENOMICS STUDIES \nMart\u00edn C. Abba.\nCINIBA, Facultad de Ciencias M\u00e9dicas, Universidad Nacional de La Plata.\nAdvances in cancer genomics during the last decade have \nbeen driven by the development of NGS technologies and \nthe generation of huge omics data. These NGS-based tech -\nnologies have inspired new computational techniques en -\nabling interrogation of biological and clinical aspects in an unprecedented manner. In this presentation, several state-\nof-the-art computational approaches are discussed, pro -\nviding a comprehensive insight into the field, including the \nidentification of mutational process, cell signaling, immune \ncell profiling, and prediction of the immunotherapy response.SYMPOSIA25\nEPIGENETICS BASIS OF B-CELL LYMPHOMAS\nWendy B\u00e9guelin\nWeill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University, New York, United States\nA majority of B-cell lymphomas \u2013diffuse large B cell lym -\nphomas (DLBCLs) and follicular lymphomas (FLs)\u2013 origi -\nnate from germinal center (GC) B cells. GCs are transient \nstructures within which B cells undergo massive prolifer -\nation and somatic hypermutation of their immunoglobulin \nloci in order to generate high affinity antibodies. Prolifer -\nation of GC B cells is strictly dependent on interactions \nwith T follicular helper cells. More than 70% of the genes \nmutated in DLBCL and FL are epigenetic modifiers, such \nas the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2D, the H3 acetyl -\ntransferases CREBBP and EP300, and the H3K27 meth -\nyltransferase EZH2. These genes are required to either \nestablish the GC phenotype or to facilitate exit from the \nGC reaction. Mutations in these genes lead to disruption \nof the immune synapse plasticity. All are acquired early \nduring pathogenesis and are considered founder muta -\ntions.Unlike DLBCLs, FLs are slow-growing, indolent tumors \ncontaining extensive follicular dendritic cell (FDC) net -\nworks. Heterozygous somatic mutation of EZH2 occurs \nin approximately 30% of FL patients and primarily af -\nfects the EZH2 SET domain, conferring more efficient \nH3K27 trimethylation activity. We show that EZH2 gain-\nof-function mutations initiate FL by attenuating GC B cell \nrequirement for T cell help and driving slow expansion \nof GC centrocytes that become enmeshed with and de -\npendent on FDCs. By impairing T cell help, mutant EZH2 \nprevents induction of proliferative MYC programs. Thus, \nEZH2 mutation fosters malignant transformation by epi -\ngenetically reprograming B cells to form an aberrant im -\nmunological niche that reflects characteristic features of \nhuman FLs, explaining how indolent tumors arise from \nGC B cells.\nSAIC SYMPOSIUM: NEUROSCIENCES: TARGETING NEUROINFLAMMATION IN CENTRAL NERVOUS \nSYSTEM DISORDERS AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES\nDUAL ROLE OF ANGIOTENSIN RECEPTORS IN INFLAMMATION: TARGETING A WOLF \nIN SHEEP\u00b4S CLOTHING. \nAlicia M. Seltzer.\nIHEM\u2011CONICET (FCM\u2011UNCuyo\u2011UNViME) \nAbnormal activation of the local renin-angiotensin sys -\ntem (RAS) in brain tissue has been associated with the \npathophysiology of neonatal encephalopathy. This is a \nheterogeneous condition characterized by decreased \nresponsiveness, seizures, hypotonia, abnormal primitive \nreflexes, apnea, feeding disturbance, and abnormal cry. \nPerinatal insults activate the immune system and trig -\nger central responses that involve glial activation and \nrelease of cytokines and chemokines, reactive oxygen \nspecies (ROS), reactive nitrosative species, excitotoxic -\nity, mitochondrial and vascular impairment. Changes in \nblood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) permeability and infiltration of \nperipheral immune cells can further contribute to inflam -\nmation in the brain. We observed inflammatory respons -\nes to hypoxia on the neonatal brain and cerebellum. In \naddition to the \u2018\u2018classical\u2019\u2019 circulating RAS, a second local \nor tissue RAS has been observed in all nervous tissues. \nAngiotensin II (Ang II), via its type 1 receptor (AT1R) \nexerts pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects. How -ever, these effects are counteracted by a RAS opposite \narm constituted by Ang II/AT2R and Ang 1-7/Mas recep -\ntor (MasR) signaling. We studied the role of the AT2R \nmicrovasculature responses to hypoxia in the neonatal \nbrain. Other studies of our laboratory explored how cu -\ntaneous inflammation affected the expression of AT1R \nand AT2R in subpopulations of rat dorsal root ganglion \nneurons. We found that AT2R was selectively and differ -\nentially modulated throughout the inflammation process. \nRecently another member of the RAS family, ACE2 has \nbeen identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, \nwhich causes Covid-19. ACE2 and AT2R seem to coun -\nteract the detrimental actions of AT1R. Regulation of \nmutually antagonistic AT1R and ACE2/AT2R is essential \nfor maintaining control of inflammation and an imbalance \nbetween these two receptors is potentially pathological. \nThe complexity of these mechanisms remains under \nstudy.

Mutations in isocitrate \ndehydrogenase (mIDH) are present in most patients with \nlower grade gliomas (LGG), and are correlated with bet -\nter prognosis and survival. We hypothesized that mIDH1 \nvia the production of 2HG, induces epigenetic repro -\ngramming leading to alterations in brain tumor infiltrating \nimmune cells\u2019 phenotype and function. To examine the \nrole of mIDH1 in the brain tumor immune microenviron -\nment (TME), we generated LGG glioma models using the \nsleeping beauty system (Koschmann et al., 2016; Nunez \net al., 2019). Our data indicate that mIDH1 gliomas ex -\nhibit increased levels of CD11b+ Ly6G+ cells in the TME, \nBM, circulation and spleen of mice. Interestingly, the \nTME-derived CD11b+Ly6G+ myeloid cells from mIDH1 \ntumors didn\u2019t inhibit tumor antigen specific T-cells\u2019 expan -\nsion. Further analysis using single cell RNA sequencing \ncoupled with Mass cytometry revealed that the majori -ty of CD11b+Ly6G+ in the TME-mIDH1 are composed of \nnon-immune suppressive neutrophils and pre-neutro -\nphils. In contrast, CD11b+Ly6G+ from the TME-wtIDH1 \nare composed of immune suppressive PMN-MDSCs. \nThis effect of reprogramming granulocytes in the TME-\nmIDH1 is mediated by epigenetic upregulation of the \ngranulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Blocking \nG-CSF restored the inhibitory function of CD11b+ Ly6G+ \nin mIDH1, and shortened the median survival of mIDH1 \nto the same level of the wtIDH1 tumor bearing animals. \nConsistent with that, LGG is the sole tumor cohort within \nall TCGA data sets where high G-CSF is correlated with \nfavorable patient outcome. Our results provide insights \ninto novel epigenetic mechanisms triggered by mIDH1 \nwhich regulate myeloid cells\u2019 heterogeneity and immu -\nnosuppression within the brain TME; a feature that can \nbe harnessed to develop novel immunotherapeutic strat -\negies.\nIGF-1 GENE THERAPY MODULATES GLIAL CELL IN NEURODEGENERATIVE PROCESS\nClaudia B.

It has been report -\ned that the progression of many neurodegenerative dis -\neases depends on the activation of microglia and their \npolarization towards a proinflammatory phenotype and \nestablish an exacerbated immune response. Many neu -\nrotrophic factors produced by glial cells, such as Insulin \nlike growth factor 1 (IGF1), can modulate glial cells phe -\nnotype, promoting neuronal survival. IGF-1 could be neu -\nroprotective in neurodegenerative models by improving \nchanges in neuronal and glial activity.\n    Our research group has set the goal to fight the del -\neterious effects of aging in senile  rats and 6OH Dopa -\nmine animal model to understand plasticity processes \nassociated with behavior decline, analyze modifications \non glial cells through different brain areas involved in the \nproposed circuit and to carry out therapeutic approaches with IGF-1 gene therapy.\n    We showed that IGF1 gene therapy in senile rats in -\ncreased the number of microglial cells, specifically in \nthe Striatum. In addition, these cells presented higher \nreactivity and were polarized towards an M2 anti-inflam -\nmatory phenotype and those treated with RAd-IGF1 pre -\nsented higher phagocytic activity and greater synaptic \nremodeling. Moreover, in PD animal model, we found an \nearly behavioral cognitive decline that was partially mod -\nified with IGF1 overexpression on ongoing experiments. \nWe observed astrocytes changes in different dorsal hip -\npocampus areas and changes of TH reactivity that cor -\nrelates with IGF-I overexpression. Conclusion: Further \nunderstanding of glial cells and their functions could allow \nmodulation of the microenvironment resulting in potential \ntherapeutic strategies, such as IGF-1 gene therapy, that \nimprove the course and progression of the neurodegen -\nerative process.SYMPOSIA27\nASTROCYTES ARE CENTRAL PLAYERS IN THE BRAIN NEUROINFLAMMATION AFTER INJURY\nJavier Ramos\nIBCN UBA\u2011CONICET, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires\nDamage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMP) are \nintracellular molecules released to the extracellular mi -\nlieu after tissue damage. In the Central Nervous System \n(CNS), acute brain injury releases DAMP and these mol -\necules activate astrocytes and microglia which are the \ninnate immunity effectors in the CNS. Astrocytes rapid -\nly respond to damage with reactive astrogliosis that is \ncharacterized by prominent phenotypical alterations that \nhave been classically described for almost a century. \nMore recently, it was shown that subsequent astroglial \npolarization to the A1 phenotype can induce neurode -\ngeneration; while conversion to the A2 phenotype usu -\nally facilitates neuronal survival. Using a combination of \nin vivo  models of brain damage (traumatic brain injury, \nbrain ischemia and epileptic seizures); in vitro  glial and \nneuronal cell cultures and in silico  mathematical model -ing; we have been able to demonstrate that astrocytes \nrequire microglia to become reactive and to polarize to \nthe A1 proinflammatory-neurodegenerative phenotype \nafter DAMP stimulation. Conversely, microglial cells also \nincrease their response to DAMP when they are co-cul -\ntured with astrocytes. Moreover, disruption of DAMP-me -\ndiated signaling pathways shows beneficial effects by \nreducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration \nin the injured brain. We conclude that bidirectional mi -\ncroglial-astroglial cooperation is required for astrocytes \nto respond to DAMP and to induce neuroinflammation in \nthe injured brain. Thus, early treatment strategies aimed \nat blocking downstream DAMP-activated signaling path -\nways are likely to have a significant beneficial effect in \nneuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.      \nSAIC SYMPOSIUM: LIPIDS IN CONTEXT: FROM HEALTH TO DISEASE\nARYLACETAMIDE DEACETYLASE (AADAC), A NEW PLAYER IN HEPATIC LIPID HOMEOSTASIS\nJihong Lian1,2, Russell Watts1,2, \n Randal Nelson1, 2, John P.

Hepatic triacylglycerol \n(TG) and cholesteryl ester (CE) synthesis, lipolysis and \ntransport are regulated by nutritional status. Fasting in -\ncreases hepatic TG/CE storage and this storage is rap -\nidly depleted during refeeding. The lipolytic processes \nresponsible for TG/CE turnover during refeeding have \nnot yet been characterized. We have identified a novel \nliver lipase arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) that is \nlocalized in the endoplasmic reticulum and exhibits hy -\ndrolytic activity toward diacylglycerol, TG and CE. We \nhave found that AADAC is responsible for the hepatic \nTG/CE turnover during the fasting/refeeding transition. \nTG/CE depletion was abolished during the refeeding pe -riod in AADAC deficient mice. AADAC knockout mice ac -\ncumulated significantly more hepatic neutral lipids than \nwild type mice when challenged with western-type diet, \nand exhibited accelerated progression of hepatic ste -\natosis in the long-term western-type diet feeding study. \nDecreased lipolysis, altered lipid droplet dynamics, and \nincreased de novo  lipogenesis in the fasting/refeeding \ncycle could contribute to the blunted lipid turnover in AA -\nDAC deficient hepatocytes. These findings indicate that \nAADAC plays an important role in hepatic lipid metabo -\nlism adapted to changing nutritional conditions and that \ndysregulation of AADAC activity to interrupt this process \nleads to fatty liver.\nCONSEQUENCES OF ENHANCED CHOLESTEROL HYDROXYLATION IN THE OLD BRAIN \nMauricio Mart\u00edn\nInstituto de Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mercedes y Mart\u00edn Ferreyra, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas \ny T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba (UNC), C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.\nCholesterol is essential for the function of all the animal \ncells.

Cholesterol elimina -\ntion from the brain takes place mainly by hydroxylation, \na step catalyzed by a brain specific cytochrome P450 \ncontaining enzyme called Cholesterol 24-hydroxylase or \nCYP46. \nWe have shown increased expression of CYP46 in old \nneurons, where membrane cholesterol reduction has a \nnumber of consequences as altered function, mobility and endocytosis of synaptic receptors. Cholesterol de -\ncreases in the old also impairs the proper activation of \nneuronal signaling pathways with a negative impact on \nlearning and memory.\nSince abnormal increase of CYP46 has been found in \nglial cells either in neurologic diseases or after traumat -\nic brain injury, we investigated the specific brain regions \nand cell types in which CYP46 expression is increased \nduring aging.  Finally, we analyzed if aging is able to \npredispose for abnormal CYP46 expression after brain \ninjury, where cholesterol hydroxylation would mediate in -\nflammatory processes.\nTHE USE OF FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINSAS SUPPORTIVE THERAPY DURING THE TREATMENT \nOF LIVER DISEASES WITH IFN-\u0391-2B\nQuiroga AD , Vera MC, Lucci A, Comanzo CG, Lorenzetti F, Ferretti AC, Ceballos MP, Alvarez ML, Carrillo MC. \nInstituto de Fisiolog\u00eda Experimental (CONICET).

Rosario, Santa Fe.\nVitamins are essential components of the diet that do not \nprovide calories, and that are necessary for the mainte -\nnance of metabolic and growth functions. The fat-soluble \nvitamins (A, D, E and K) are absorbed in the gastrointes -\ntinal tract and usually stored in the liver, adipose tissue \nand muscle, and eliminated with feces. Generally, vita -\nmins are used as reinforcement therapy in patients with \ncomplex diseases, such as cancer, whose course and/\nor treatment puts them in a state of general discomfort. \nMany experts worldwide advise patients against the use \nof supplements and promote obtaining nutrients from \nfoods whenever possible.\nIFN-\u03b1 has been used clinically for deferring the progres -\nsion of liver damage or for the prevention of hepatocel -\nlular carcinoma progression in patients with chronic hep -\natitis B or C. Interestingly, many IFN-\u03b1-treated patients \nundergo a flu-like state, which makes them eager to \nconsume supportive vitamins as nutritional supplements. \nHowever, the benefits of such combinations are not fully \nstudied. \nIt has been demonstrated that simultaneous treatment of \nmouse cells with interferon and vitamin A (retinoic acid) resulted in an inhibition of interferon action. On the oth -\ner hand, it has been reported that vitamin D exerts very \ninteresting outcomes when combined with interferon to \ntreat hepatitis and other hepatic malignances. The num -\nber one fat-soluble vitamin consumed worldwide, vita -\nmin E, has been demonstrated to be not entirely safe, \nif safe at all, when used combined with drugs that act \nas pro-oxidant, as interferon. And finally, vitamin K has \nbeen demonstrated to be effective when combined with \nantitumor drugs to enhance their antiproliferative effects; \nbut also, it has been demonstrated to block the apoptotic \neffects of IFN- \u03b1 in a rat model of hepatocarcinogenesis. \nThe aim of this presentation is to summarize the effects \nof different fat soluble vitamins when consumed as sup -\nportive therapy during the treatment of liver diseases with \nIFN-\u03b1-2b. \nFindings from our own and other authors reveal that \nsupportive therapies with vitamins are not always safe, \nas they could put patients\u2019 lives at risk.

These un -\ncertainties are mainly based on meta-analysis that, al -\nthough they found direct association between TG and \nadverse outcomes, this association becomes nonsignifi -\ncant after multivariate statistical analysis.\nIt is difficult, then, to explain the relationship between the \nisolated and direct effect of elevated TG on cardiovascu -\nlar disease, in part because TG levels are commonly as -sociated with concomitant alterations such as decreased \nHDL-C or predominance of small dense LDL.\nWhen high TG concentrations are measured, it means \nthat there is an accumulation of circulating triglyceride \nrich lipoproteins (TRL), that is a set of VLDLs, Chylomi -\ncrons and their remnants, potentially atherogenic\nCertain points will be explained for the understanding of \nthe underlying atherogenic mechanisms of TRL, through \nsome stages of the TRL metabolism: TRL production \nrate, Lipoprotein alterations in chemical composition and SYMPOSIA29\nsize, their lipolytic degradation and the effect of TRL on \nendothelium. These points will be addressed through in -\nsulin-resistance (IR) models and functional studies\nSome years ago, we implemented an IR animal model \nto assess the rate of VLDL secretion. By means of Triton \ninjection the clearance of circulating VLDL was inhibited \nfor 2 h, and an increase in plasma TG accumulation was \nobserved in IR rats, allowing the rate of VLDL secretion \nto be calculated. We could confirm that hyperinsulinemia \ninduces an over-secretion of VLDL particles\nIn metabolic syndrome patients, we also evidenced \nan overproduction of VLDL through the total mass and \nVLDL-apoB levels, as particle number indicators. Most \nof these patients have fatty liver and then our results \nindicate that hepatic steatosis could have a role in the \noverproduction. Regarding chemical composition and \nsize, isolated VLDL showed over enrichment in TG, and \nanalyzing the HPLC results of the VLDL profile, we found \nthat the area of picks belonging to IR patients were high -\ner than controls, showing a predominance of larger TRL. \nThese results are in line with the experiments based on \nin vivo kinetic studies in humans, where they observed \nlarge VLDLs, being liver fat a driven force for their pro -\nduction. \nAs part of the mechanisms, the aforementioned results \ncan be attributed to differences in the regulators of the \nlevel of liver fatty acids. We found increased SREBP1c \nand reduced PPAR\u03b1, which impacted on the synthesis of \nfatty acids in IR rats, and were significantly related to the \nproduction of large VLDL particles, with a high content of \nTG. At this point the question that may arise is whether \nthese large VLDLs are atherogenic.\nAnother alteration among the circulating TRL consist of \nsmaller VLDL particles, cholesterol enriched. The cho -\nlesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), that facilitates the \ntransport of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between \nthe lipoproteins, probably has a role on the circulating \nVLDL characteristics of individuals suffer from several \nconditions. In metabolic syndrome patients, CETP main -\ntained increased activity and also showed a significant \ncorrelation with VLDL cholesterol content, as product \nof its activity. Cholesterol-rich VLDL are like IDL or rem -\nnants particles (RLP). We think that secreted VLDL in \nIR are over-enriched in TG, and in circulation become \nrich in cholesterol. Moreover, another consequence that \nis likely occurring when CETP activity is increased is the \nproduction of small and dense LDL, that also contributes \nto the atherogenic profile\nContinuing with the lipolytic degradation stage of the lipo -\nproteins, there are many issues to comment because not \nonly the enzyme activities are relevant, but also their reg -\nulators, such as Apo CII and Apo CIII, GPIHDLBP1, Apo \nAV, among other factors, being lipoprotein-lipase (LPL) \nactivity a resultant of the action of its regulators.  Two \npoints were scarcely studied. 1- the controversial activity \nof LPL in IR states, and 2- the quality or behavior of TRL \nas substrate of the lipolytic enzymes On the one hand, we observed in metabolic syndrome \nand obese subjects a decreased LPL activity, and in -\ncreased HL as well. The finding of LPL reduced activity \ncontribute to elucidate debated and paradoxical mecha -\nnisms regarding lipolysis of TRL in IR states. \nFollowing with the affinity of TRL and LPL, in normal con -\nditions this goes on well. When VLDL is TG overload -\ned, it would seem to be a bad substrate for LPL, and it \nwould not produce LDL. However, several years ago, we \nhave design an in vitro  assay incubating different types \nof VLDL with commercial (standard) LPL, in adequate \nconditions, obtained the kinetic curve and the Km, being \nthe inverse of Km a marker of enzyme-substrate affinity.  \nThen we observed that actually LPL has a high affini -\nty with VLDL overloaded in TG. Thus, lipolysis occurs, \nsize of VLDL become smaller and then it surely can pass \nthrough the arterial wall\nAnother interesting point is the role of Adiponectin not \nonly in the production but also in degradation of TRL. \nAdiponectin, is reduced in IR, we observed this in the \npresent or absent of fatty liver, and its reduction was as -\nsociated with the increase in the number of large VLDL \nparticles. Moreover, we found a positive correlation be -\ntween LPL and Adiponectin, even significant after ad -\njusting by HOMA and other IR factors, suggesting that \nAdiponectin may favor lipolysis in normal conditions, and \nwhen it is reduced, contributes to a delay in lipoprotein \ndegradation.\nWith the aim to assess the effect on endothelium of al -\ntered TRL, we applied a known system to measure endo -\nthelial function dependent on nitric oxide (NO), working \nwith isolated aorta rings (endothelium tissue) incubated \nwith VLDLs isolated from patients with IR, and controls. \nWe have induced 100 % contraction with nor-adrenaline \nand then allowed relaxation with increasing concentra -\ntion of acetylcholine.  Then dose-responses curves were \nplotted, and comparing with typical VLDL from controls, \nVLDL from IR patients   showed an inhibition in the va -\nsorelaxation, consequence to endothelial dysfunction. \nThus, beyond high plasma TG levels, alterations in TRL \ncan induced endothelial dysfunction, that represent one \nof the first step of atherogenic mechanism. \nHowever, in the same system, the presence of HDL, al -\nlows the inhibition of relaxation to be lower, because HDL \nneutralizes or protects the effect of endothelial dysfunc -\ntion that exert the altered VLDL \nIn Summary, the accumulation of TRL in circulation pro -\nmotes influx into the arterial wall and their retention. \nLarge particles cannot enter but LPL has high affinity and \ncan quickly hydrolyzed these particles, reducing their \nsize and can easily enter being taken by macrophages \nwithout previous modification, because TRL are usually \noxidized in plasma. Moreover, these particles exert endo -\nthelial dysfunction and promote an inflammatory context \nthat could be evidenced by an increase in circulating high \nsensitivity reactive \u201cC\u201d protein.MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

These diseases are character -\nized by an increase in IL-4 production and a decrease in \nIFN- \u03b3 .The deficiency of essential fatty acids impairs the \nimmune response in different ways. Many of the immu -\nnological changes associated with essential fatty acids \nand arising from in vitro and animal model studies have \nbeen attributed to modifications in endogenous eicosa -\nnoids production and subsequent control of cytokines \nand immunoglobulin synthesis. Arachidonic acid deriva -tives (omega6) - Prostaglandin PGE2 and Leukotriene \nLTB4 - are mediators of inflammation; on the contrary, \nthose from the omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from \nfish oils seem to exert an antitumor effect through their \nimmune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory action and \nthe direct inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, through the \nalteration in the pathway of the production of the PGE2.\nMoreover, the function of many cells of the immune \nsystem depends on metabolic steps that need various \nnutrients - minerals and vitamins  - as critical cofactors, \namong them we can mention some minerals (Zn, Fe, Cu, \nSe) and vitamins: fat soluble Vitamins (A, D, E) and water \nsoluble vitamins(B6, B12, C, Folic Acid)\nIt is important to note that all considerations related to the \neffects of nutritional imbalances on the immune system \nmust be based on the complexity and heterogeneity of \nimmunecompetent cells, their subpopulations and prod -\nucts such as interleukins and interferon and other induc -\ning and / or regulatory systems.\nMICROBIOTA AND LIFESTYLE\nAscensi\u00f3n Marcos , Noem\u00ed Redondo-Useros, Natalia Gonz\u00e1lez-Zancada, Ligia E. D\u00edaz, Sonia G\u00f3mez-Mart\u00ednez, \nEsther Nova.\nInstitute of Food Science, Technology and Nutrition (ICTAN). Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). Madrid. Spain.\nThere is wide scientific evidence about the necessity to \nmaintain a good balance and functionality of the com -\nposition of the microbiota to regulate homeostasis and \npreserve health. However, the characteristics of the \nmicrobiota are still controversial and there is a lack of \ndefinition considering a healthy gut microbiota. This fact \nalong with the multifactorial nature intrinsic features of \nhumans complicates to make general recommendations \non appropriate dietary patterns and diverse lifestyle hab -\nits to improve our microbiota. Indeed, not only food con -\nsumption, but also, eating behaviour, physical activity, \nsleep quality and quantity, as well as stress situations \nand socioeconomic conditions are very important factors \nto bear in mind, since they can affect the microbiota and \nhence, the immune system function.\nFurthermore, the variable response of healthy adults to \nthe intake of probiotics and prebiotics suggest the exis -\ntence of potential intra-individual factors affecting the ini -\ntial interaction between commensal microorganisms and \ndietary ingredients and thus accounting for gut microbi -ota changes in a greater extent than diet. The changing \ndietary habits worldwide with a large offer of processed \nand ultra-processed foods containing artificial ingredi -\nents such as sweeteners, the coincident rise in emotion -\nal disorders, and the worsening of other lifestyle habits \nsuch as smoking, alcohol and drugs consumption, sed -\nentary lifestyle and sleep, can together contribute to gut \ndysbiosis and thus, to health impairment and non-com -\nmunicable chronic diseases development. \nTherefore, our main concern is to have the skills to build \na healthy microbiota, capable to defend the organism to -\ngether with the immune system against any adverse ef -\nfects produced by pathogens or strange substances (tox -\nins, carcinogenic and environmental molecules). This is \nthe reason why the study of the effects of specific dietary \ningredients (probiotics, prebiotics, alcohol, sweeteners \nand fats) in the gut microbiota of healthy adults acquires \na great interest as well as the potential intra-individual \nfactors involved, and the influence of other potential life -\nstyle factors.SYMPOSIA31\nROLE OF PROBIOTIC BACTERIA IN IMMUNITY AND INFLAMMATION\nGabriela Perdig\u00f3n1,2 , Carolina Maldonado1,2  Silvia Cazorla1,2  \n1-CERELA -CONICET, Tucum\u00e1n, ARGENTINA  2\u2011 Universidad Nacional de Tucum\u00e1n\nScientific advances in the signals induced for the micro -\nbiota allowed to understand how the probiotics influence \nthe mucosal immune system (MIS). Probiotics induce a \nnetwork of signals to the gut immune cells to activate the \nMIS. These bacteria interact with the intestinal immune \ncells (IECs) inducing Goblet and Paneth cells to produce \nmucus and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The interac -\ntion between IECs and probiotics is mediated by cyto -\nkines release without eliciting inflammatory mechanisms \nin the host, in contrast with pathogens. How probiotics \nachieve a balance between stimulation and anti-inflam -\nmatory mechanisms? Probiotic strains stimulate the \nMIS increasing IgA+ cells in the intestine, bronchus and \nbreast and induce immunomodulation through IL-10. We \nalso demonstrated that probiotics stimulate innate im -\nmune cells: dendritic cells and macrophages without tis -\nsue damage. Probiotics induce an activation of proteins \nregulatory genes that modulate the NFkB and MAPK via. \nThese genes are not activated by pathogens. The biolog -ical mechanisms observed open the door for the study of \nanti-inflammatory mechanisms, from probiotic, probiotic \nfermented milk (PFM) and Yogurt. In an acute inflamma -\ntory model induced by Salmonella,  probiotics lactobacilli \noral administration was able to reduce the inflammation \nthrough the production of AMPs that minimize the inter -\nnalization of the pathogen to the intestine. In a respira -\ntory allergy model the PFM induced a balance to Th1 \nwith production of IgG instead of IgE. These previous \nresults led us to study the anti-inflammatory mechanisms \nmediated by yogurt in a model of ulcerative colitis. We \ndemonstrated that the main effect of yogurt is the de -\ncrease of IL-17 and the increase of IL-10. In a model of \nchronic inflammation as obesity we observed a diminu -\ntion in markers of metabolic syndrome. Probiotics, PFM \nand yogurt have an important role in the mechanisms of \nthe immune surveillance, playing a role in the immuno -\nregulation of the MIS.\nVITAMIN D AND IMMUNITY\nVald\u00e9s-Ramos R , Mart\u00ednez-Carrillo BE, Guadarrama-L\u00f3pez AL, Rom\u00e1n-Casas M.\nFacultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de M\u00e9xico, Mexico.\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, found in very few foods, \nsuch as egg yolk, oily fish and organ meats, as well as \nin fortified dairy products. Its main source is through the \nconversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to pro-vitamin D2 in \nskin when exposed to UV light from sun. Vitamins D2 and \nD3 are further metabolized in liver and kidney to render \n1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol). \nIts traditionally known functions are related to bone \nmineralization and skeletal health. However, in the last \ndecades, other functions have been described. All nu -\ncleated cells have vitamin D receptors (VDR) on their \nsurface, indicating a role not only in calcium absorption, \nbut in many other metabolic processes. With respect to \nthe immune system, VDRs are present in T and B cells, \nmonocytes and antigen presenting cells. \nIt increases chemotaxis and phagocytosis by macro -\nphages and monocytes, inducing antimicrobial peptide \nproduction. It has been observed that calcitriol promotes \ndifferentiation of dendritic cells, while inducing tolerance as a protective effect from autoimmunity. With respect \nto T-cells, it reduces the production of Th17 and the se -\ncretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 and \nIL-17. B-cell homeostasis is also modulated by vitamin \nD, as it inhibits the development of plasma and memory \ncells, promoting apoptosis and autophagy after an infec -\ntion or stressor. \nVitamin D is also necessary to maintain normal immune \nsystem in the gastrointestinal tract and its subclinical \ndeficiency may be associated with dysbiosis of the gut \nmicrobiota, leading to low-grade inflammation through \nmetabolic endotoxemia.\nWhile clinical deficiency is associated with rickets and \nosteoporosis, subclinical deficiency has been found in \nseveral upper respiratory tract infections, obstructive pul -\nmonary disease and allergic asthma among others. \nWe can conclude that vitamin D is indispensable for the \nadequate function of the innate and acquired immune \nsystem, as well as the gastrointestinal local immunity.\nSAIC -SAI SYMPOSIUM\nAUTOINFLAMMATORY INTERFERONOPATHIES:  AN EXPANDING DISEASE SPECTRUM \nAND UPDATES ON TREATMENTS\nRaphaela Goldbach-Mansky, M.D. MHS\nTranslational Autoinflammatory Diseases Section (TADS), LCIM, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA\nGenetic causes of autoinflammatory diseases unraveled \ncytoplasmic innate immune pathways that constitute an innate surveillance system and provided mechanis -\ntic insight into inflammatory pathways that drive sterile MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 202032\ninflammation.  Recently, disease-causing gain-of-func -\ntion (GOF) mutations in viral sensors or loss-of-function \n(LOF) mutations in the ubiquitin proteasome system \ncause autoinflammatory diseases amplified by Type-I \nIFN dysregulation, that can be identified and monitored \nby a chronically elevated IFN response gene (IRG) sig -\nnature in blood. \nMonogenic defects that cause autoinflammatory interfer -\nonopathies can be linked to increased transcription of IF\u2011\nNAs and IFNB1  and to the production of IRGs that have \nbecome the \u201cread out\u201d for IFN signaling in these patients.  \nWhile GOF mutations in the viral sensor and adaptor mol -\necule STING1  lead to STING ligand independent activa -\ntion of downstream pathways and predominantly IFNB1  \ntranscription, mutations in genes encoding proteasome \ncomponents lead to viral sensor independent IFNA s and \nIFNB1  transcription in hematopoietic and non-hematopoi -\netic cells that can be modeled by progressive downregu -\nlation of proteasome genes in vitro .  Lastly LOF mutations in genes that encode nucleases and DNA and RNA editing \nenzymes, result in accumulation of intracellular self-nucleic \nacids that activate the IFN pathways though engagement \nwith viral intracellular sensors. These only partially over -\nlapping mechanisms that drive the IRG signature are as -\nsociated with different clinical phenotypes and provide in -\nsights into mechanisms that drive systemic autoimmunity.\nRecent discoveries of specific mutations in IKBKG, OTU \u2011\nLIN and SAMD9L  that activate the IRG signature and ad -\nditional inflammatory pathways, which is reflected by the \nonly partial response to JAK inhibitors, coupled with mu -\nrine data implying NFKB activation downstream of STING \npoint to crosstalk between IFN regulating and other inflam -\nmatory pathways that remain elusive.\nAs the currently available treatments for presumed inter -\nferonopathies target IFN signaling, mechanistic insights \ninto the pathways that cause CANDLE, SAVI and AGS and \ntheir clinical mimics, may reveal novel targets for treatment \nof these and other conditions with phenotypic overlap.  \nDIAGNOSIS OF IL-1-ASSOCIATED AUTOINFLAMMATORY DISEASES IN ARGENTINA\nSilvia Danieli\u00e1n\nHospital de Pediatr\u00eda S.A.M.I.C. Prof. Dr. Juan P. Garrahan, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nMonogenic autoinflammatory diseases triggered by a \ndysregulated activation of the inflammasome that is \nusually accompanied by an hyperactivation of the IL-1 \npathway can be exemplified by Familial Mediterranean \nFever (FMF). This pathology, which was the first heredi -\ntary autoinflammatory disease described (1945), is also \none of the most prevalent and one of the first in which the \ngenetic etiology could be identified. Indeed, since 1997, \nwhen two groups identified the MEFV gene by positional \ncloning, we know that FMF is due to mutations in this \ngene, which codes for the pyrin protein. Since then, in our \nlaboratory of the Immunology and Rheumatology service \nof the Garrahan hospital, we have studied the presence \nof mutations in patients with suspected FMF by Sanger \nsequencing. At the beginning of the 21st century, the \ndiscovery of a caspase activating complex called the In -\nflammasome, laid the foundations for unraveling the pre -cise molecular mechanisms in which pyrin participates \nin the pathophysiological process of FMF development. \nThese findings opened the doors for the identification of \ndifferent components of the inflammasome, in particular \ncaspase-1 and interleukin-1\u00df. Inflammasomopathies \nhave since been expanded to include those arising from \n\u201cgain-of-function\u201d mutations in other components of the \ninflammasome (such as NLRP3) or in upstream mole -\ncules that regulate inflammation of the inflammasome \n(such as MVK). Furthermore, inflammasomopathies \ninclude \u201closs of function\u201d mutations in molecules that \ndecrease antagonism to IL-1. This scenario in which \nmutations in different genes may be responsible for a \nspecific clinical phenotype opened the doors to broaden \nour methodological approach when establishing molecu -\nlar diagnoses for these pathologies.\nSAI SYMPOSIUM I\nCELL MIGRATION PROMOTES THE FUNCTIONAL DIVERSIFICATION OF GUT DENDRITIC CELLS\nAna-Maria Lennon-Dum\u00e9nil\nCurie Institute, Paris, France\nDendritic cells (DCs) patrol peripheral tissues and trans -\nport antigens to lymph nodes to initiate and regulate adap -\ntive immune responses. Within tissues, DCs constitute a \ncomplex cell population made of numerous DC subsets \nthat express different surface markers and eventually \ndisplay distinct functions. How cell-intrinsic programs \nand tissue-specific cues drive this functional diversifica -\ntion of DCs is only partially understood. We here show \nthat in the small intestine, transmigration of lamina pro -pria CD103+CD11b+ conventional DC2s (cDC2s) into the \nepithelium deeply modifies their transcriptional profile, \npromoting the acquisition of an immature DC phenotype \nwith low expression of pro-inflammatory genes, co-stim -\nulatory molecules and CCR7. Accordingly, we found that \nintraepithelial cDC2s efficiently internalize antigens but \nlead to T cell anergy. We further identify Myosin II-de -\npendent migration as a critical cell-intrinsic mechanism \nessential for the formation of the intraepithelial DC pop -SYMPOSIA33\nulation, and retinoic acid as an extracellular cue driving \nthis process. As a consequence of this, intraepithelial \nDCs predominantly exist in the upper regions of the gut \nwherein this metabolite concentrates. Thus, the fine-tun -ing of DC migration by both cell-intrinsic and environ -\nmental cues controls their compartmentalization and \nfunctional diversification within tissues.\nCRUZIPAIN AND ITS PHYSIOLOGICAL INHIBITOR, CHAGASIN, AS A DNA-BASED THERAPEUTIC \nVACCINE AGAINST TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI\nCerny N, Bivona AE, S\u00e1nchez Alberti A, Trinitario S, Delfino MA, Morales C, Cardoso A, Cazorla SI, Malchiodi EL\nInstituto de estudios de la inmunidad humoral Prof. Ricardo A. Margni (IDEHU), Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), Consejo \nNacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nChagas disease caused by the protozoan parasite Try\u2011\npanosoma cruzi is endemic in 21 Latin America countries \nand the southern United States of America, and now is \nspreading into several other countries due to migration. \nDespite the efforts to control the vector throughout the \nAmericas, currently there are almost 7 million infected \npeople worldwide, causing approximately 10,000 deaths \nper year, and 70 million people at risk to acquire the in -\nfection. Chagas disease treatment is restricted only to \ntwo parasiticidal drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox \nwhich are effective during the acute and early infections \nbut have not been found to be as effective in chronic in -\nfection. No prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine for human \nuse has been communicated at this moment. Here we \nevaluate in a mouse model, a therapeutic DNA vaccine \ncombining Cruzipain (Cz), a T. cruzi cysteine protease \nthat proved to be protective in several settings, and Cha -gasin (Chg), which is the natural Cz inhibitor. The DNA \nof both antigens, as well as a plasmid encoding GM-CSF \nas adjuvant, were orally administrated and delivered \nby an attenuated Salmonella strain to treat mice during \nthe acute phase of T. cruzi infection. The bi-component \nvaccine based on Salmonella carrying Cz and Chg \n(SChg+SCz) was able to improve the protection obtained \nby each antigen as mono-component therapeutic vac -\ncine and significantly increased the titers of antigen- and \nparasite-specific antibodies. More importantly, the bi -\ncomponent vaccine triggered a robust cellular response \nwith IFN-\u03b3 secretion that rapidly reduced the parasitemia \nduring the acute phase and decreased the tissue dam -\nage in the chronic stage of the infection, suggesting it \ncould be an effective tool to ameliorate the pathology as -\nsociated to Chagas disease.\nSAI SYMPOSIUM II\nDEFINING THE MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE THE INITIATION AND RESOLUTION \nOF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES (IBD).\nEduardo Villablanca\nKarolinska Institute, Sweden.\nThe focus of my research program is to understand the \nmechanisms that underlie the initiation  and resolution  of \nInflammatory bowel disease  (IBD), an immune-mediated \ninflammatory disease that affects more than three million \npeople in Europe and for which no cure currently exists . \nTo achieve these goals, we have developed a research \nprogram that integrates cellular immunology, bioinformat -\nics and the creation of novel in vivo  models to ultimately interrogate the function of IBD-associated polymorphisms, \nto study the crosstalk between the host and the environ -\nment, and to identify novel genes and pathways involved \nin mucosal healing. In this talk, I will discuss our new ex -\nperimental models to visualize the initiation of IBD. Finally, \nI will discuss the use of data mining, single cell and spatial \ntranscriptomics to identify new pathways promoting muco -\nsal healing upon intestinal injury.  \nCANDIDA ALBICANS  AND INNATE IMMUNITY: FROM COMMENSALISM TO INFECTION PATHOGENESIS\nClaudia E Sotomayor.\nLaboratorio de Inmunidad Innata a Pat\u00f3genos F\u00fangicos. Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica Cl\u00ednica, CIBICI\u2011CONICET, Facultad de \nCiencias Qu\u00edmicas, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba.\nCandida albicans  is a pleomorphic fungus commensal of \ndifferent mucosa surfaces.  As part of the vaginal micro -\nbiome coexists with bacterial communities in a harmo -\nnious balance and under strict control of local immune \nresponse.  The disruption of this condition such as dys -\nbiosis and an abnormal host mucosal immune response to Candida,  favored the fungal overgrowth, morphoge -\nnetic changes, expression of hyphae-associated viru -\nlence factors and tissue invasion.  Vaginal infection by \nCandida species, known as vulvovaginal candidiasis \n(VVC), is considered an acute inflammatory disease that \naffects more than 75% of healthy women at least once MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 202034\nin their lifetime. 5-10% of women suffer from recurrent \nVVC (RVVC), defined as \u22654 episodes per year.  Clinical \nand experimental evidences revealed the critical role of \nlocal innate immunity in both defense and pathogenesis \nof vaginal infection by Candida spp. In the vaginal tract, \nepithelial cells provide the first barrier against the fun -\ngus and are actively involved both, in the recognition of \npathogenic phenotype of fungus and in the initiation of \nlocal response through the release of antimicrobial pep -\ntides (AMP), alarmins, chemokines and some cytokines. \nThrough integration of immunological studies in animal \nmodels of VVC, patients with acute and recurrent form of mycosis and proteomic approaches we identified the \ncontribution of AMPs and Interferon Type I (IFN-I) in the \npathogenesis of Candida  vaginitis. Ours results provide \nevidences about the ability of fungal virulence factors to \ndown-regulate the expression of Beta Defensin, AMPs \nwith relevant candidacidal and immunomodulatory prop -\nerties in vaginal tract. Our findings also reveal new data \nabout the activation of IFN-I pathway on epithelial cells \nafter fungal immune recognition and its protective role \nduring VVC. Identification of cellular processes and mo -\nlecular pathways contributes to a better understanding of \nthis mycosis and open new therapeutic avenues. \nSIMPOSIO SAFIS.  \u201cNUTRICI\u00d3N Y FITOTERAPIA\u201d \nPRENATAL AND EARLY POSNATAL NUTRITION: A CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC RISK FACTOR?\nCristina Arranz\nFacultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Univesidad Nacional de Buenos Aires. carranz@ffyb.uba.ar\nNumerous epidemiological and experimental studies \ndemonstrate a correlation between an adverse intrauterine \nenvironment and increased risk of cardiovascular and \nmetabolic diseases in adulthood. People exposed to \nfamine in utero show a more atherogenic lipid profile, \nimpaired glucose tolerance and higher prevalence of \nhypertension and diabetes. The fetal programming \nhypothesis, suggests that an injury during fetal life, \nwhich leads to restricted intrauterine growth, not only \nresults in low birth weight but also adaptive responses \nthat can lead to the loss of structural units (nephrons, \ncardiomyocytes, \u03b2 pancreatic cells, skeletal muscle cells) \nin order to maintain the development of other organs, \nsuch as the brain. These adaptive changes can bring \nimmediate advantages by increasing perinatal survival \nin a poor nutritional environment, but program a lower \nmorphological and functional capacity for their life and \nthe increased risk of developing chronic diseases, such \nas diabetes type II, high blood pressure, renal disease, obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome . \nIn addition, it is known that vi tamins and minerals are \nessential for human health and development since \nthey participate in numerous biochemical functions and \nare involved in intermediate and energy metabolism \nand have  antioxidant properties. Inadequate intake \nof micronutrients, also known as hidden malnutrition, \nduring critical periods of growth has become also a major \nhealth problem in developed and developing countries, \nparticularly in pregnant women, infants and children \nwho have an unbalanced diet . In summary, numerous \nepidemiological and experimental studies have shown \nthat metabolic and nutritional imbalances during a critical \ntime window in development have persistent effects on \nthe health of the offspring and may be responsible for in \nutero  programming of diseases such as obesity, diabetes \nand high blood pressure in adulthood and highlights the \ncritical importance of perinatal care optimization for better \nmanagement and prevention of adult diseases. \nEFFECTS OF CANNABIS ON MYOCARDIAL DAMAGE INDUCED BY ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION\nSusana Mosca\nCentro de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares, Universidad Nacional de la Plata \u2013 CONICET . \nThere is growing evidence that the endocannabinoid \nsystem is implicated both in cardiovascular physiology \nand the pathogenesis of hypertension, heart disease and \natherosclerosis. Our aim was to determine the effects \nof the acute treatment of a cannabinoid extract (CBE), \nobtained from the Cannabis sativa sp,  on myocardial \nischemia-reperfusion injury. The extract was characterized \nand quantified by gas chromatography coupled to \nmass spectrometry (GC-MS). The profile was: D9-\ntetrahydrocannabinol ( D9-THC): 1.35 mg/ml; cannabidiol \n(CBD): 0.51 mg/ml and cannabinol (CBN); 0.34 mg/ml. \nIsolated rat hearts perfused by Langendorff system were \nassigned to the following experimental groups: Non ischemic \ncontrol (NIC): 110 min of perfusion: Ischemic control (IC): 30 min of global ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion (R) \nand CBE: 0.1 mg/ml of the extract was administered during \nthe first 10 min of R. Infarct size (IS) was determined by \nTTC staining. Systolic and diastolic function was assessed \nby the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and the \nend diastolic ventricular pressure (LVEDP), respectively. \nThe expression of phosphorylated forms of Akt, PKC e and \ne-NOS, and the content of CB1 and CB2 receptors were \ndetermined by western blot. CBE significantly decreased \nIS (2.3 \u00b1 0.5 % vs 31 \u00b1 2 %  in IC)  and improved the post-\nischemic recovery of myocardial function. At the end of R, \nLVDP was 70 \u00b1 10 % vs 17 \u00b1 3 % and LVEDP 15 \u00b1 3 vs 57 \u00b1 5 \nmmHg with respect to IC. The expression of P-Akt, P-eNOS \nand P-PKC e decreased ~ 40% in IC and increased ~ 150 % SYMPOSIA35\nin CBE treated hearts, both compared to NIC. The content \nof CB1 increased ~ 140 % and CB2 decreased ~ 40 % in \nIC hearts. Opposite changes were observed in CBE treated \nhearts: CB1 decreased ~ 60 % y CB2 increase up to 150 %. These data demonstrate that CBE reduces cell death and \nmyocardial post-ischemic contractile dysfunction. These \nbeneficial effects appear mediated by Akt/PKC e/eNOS-\ndependent pathways activated through CB2 receptors. \nFLAVONOIDS AT THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT: IMPACT ON OBESITY-RELATED \nMETABOLIC DISORDERS \nPatricia I. Oteiza \nDepartment of Nutrition and Department of Environmental Toxicology, University of California, Davis, CA, USA \nThe gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a central role in \nthe absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion \nof flavonoids. Flavonoids and/or their metabolites can \nmodulate events at the GI tract that can have both local \nand systemic impact. At the GI tract, they can modulate \nnutrient absorption, GI barrier permeability, the activity of \nluminal enzymes, neutralize luminal toxins and oxidant \nspecies, and mitigate dysbiosis, tumorigenesis and \nintestinal inflammation. Such local effects have systemic \nextra-intestinal consequences, e.g. on inflammation, \nglucose homeostasis, lipid and energy metabolism. \nOvernutrition and the associated obesity, negatively \nimpact GI functions. This contributes to the development \nof insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D), steatosis, \nnon-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD), and several other \nco-morbidities. Taking the  flavan-3-ol (-)-epicatechin \n(EC) as an example of flavonoid, we observed in rodent \nmodels of high  fat- or high sugar-induced obesity and \ndysmetabolism, that EC exerts beneficial effects at the \nGI  tract mitigating also the development of T2D and \nNAFLD. At the GI tract, EC and/or its  oligomers, the procyanidins were able to : i) regulate lipid absorption; \nii) maintain the intestinal  barrier integrity and prevent \nendotoxemia; iii) regulate the synthesis/secretion of gut \nhormones  that have GI trophic actions and modulate \nglucose/lipid metabolism, iv) inhibit inflammation and  \noxidative stress; v) exert anti-colorectal cancer activity. \nThese effects were associated with decreased systemic \ninflammation improved insulin sensitivity and mitigation \nof steatosis.  NADPH oxidase and redox-regulated \nsignaling cascades (NF-\u03baB, JNK1/2, ERK1/2) emerge as \ncentral targets of EC\u2019s actions. This can in part explain \nEC capacity to mitigate GI barrier permeabilization, \nliver/adipose tissue endoplasmic reticulum stress, \ninflammation and inhibition of the insulin pathway. Some \nof the described effects/mechanisms are also exerted by \nother structurally-related flavonoids. In summary, further \nunderstanding of the mechanisms mediating the effects \nof flavonoids at the GI tract is of critical importance given \nthe relevance of the GI tract in sustaining overall health \nand of the widespread recommendations of increasing \nthe intake of plant bioactives.

Perdicaro\nLaboratorio de Nutrici\u00f3n y Fisiopatolog\u00eda de la Obesidad, Instituto de Medicina y Biolog\u00eda  Experimental de Cuyo (IMBECU)\u2011CON \u2011\nICET y Facultad de Ciencias M\u00e9dicas (FCM)\u2011 Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, Mendoza, Argentina. \nObesity is one of the main public health concerns \nworldwide. White adipose tissue (WAT) is an endocrine \norgan that stores energy excess as triglycerides. Increased \nadiposity, mainly visceral WAT, is strongly associated with \ninsulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular \ndisease, among others. In contrast to WAT, brown \nadipose  tissue (BAT) has the ability to dissipate energy \nin the form of heat due to the presence  of the uncoupling \nprotein 1 (UCP-1), a key determinant of mitochondrial \nthermogenesis.  Interestingly, \u201cbrown-like\u201d adipocytes \ncan be observed in WAT and are characterized by the \npresence of multilocular lipid droplets and high number \nof mitochondria which are associated with a reduction of \ntotal adiposity and improvement of metabolic alterations.  \nWAT browning can be triggered by different stimuli such \nas cold, exercise or pharmacological treatment, such \nas \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation or peroxisome proliferator \nactivated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonists. In addition, \nbioactive compounds such as polyphenols had been \nrecently implicated in the emergence of brown-like cells in WAT.  Polyphenols are bioactive compounds widely \ndistributed in fruits and vegetables with an important role \nin preventing and managing increased adiposity and its \ncomorbidities. We observed in rodent models of high fat-\ninduced increased adiposity and metabolic alterations \nthat supplementation with grape pomace extract (GPE), \nrich in polyphenols, stimulate the expression of the main \ntranscriptional regulators of brown-like cell  development, \ni.e., PPAR\u03b3-coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), PPAR\u03b3, PR \ndomain containing 16 (PRDM16), and UCP-1 reducing \nadipose hypertrophy and inflammation in WAT and insulin \nresistance. GPE and two of the major GPE flavonoids, \nquercetin and (-)- epicatechin, enhanced the expression \nof transcriptional regulators of browning and  UCP-1 \nthrough the up-regulation of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor \ndownstream cascade in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with \npalmitate. Overall, this finding highlights the potential \nutilization of bioactive grape-derived compounds to \nprevent/attenuate adiposity associated pathologies.MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

Essen -\ntial oils (EOs) are natural products produced by aromatic \nplants. EOs are complex mixtures that contain 2 or 3 ma -\njor phytochemicals, which can be terpenes or aromatic \ncompounds. We used paralysis assays of wild-type and \nmutant C. elegans strain to identify EOs with potential \nanthelmintic activities, reveal the active components, \nthe target sites and the mechanisms of action. We found \nthat EOs belonging to six different orders produced rap -\nid paralysis of C. elegans and we established the half maximal effective concentration values between 0.02-1.2 \npercent of EOs. All EOs tested also inhibited egg hatch -\ning, a property related to anthelmintic ability. Thus, EOs \nmediate both rapid and long-term anthelmintic effects. \nWe determined that trans-cinnamaldehyde (TC), a ma -\njor component of C. verum EO, produces both paralysis \nand egg-hatching inhibition. By testing mutant worms, \nwe identified the muscle L-AChR and GABA receptors \nas EOs and TC targets in vivo. Thus, by modulating two \nreceptors with key roles in worm motility, these EOs \nemerge as novel sources of anthelmintic compounds. \nLikewise, the N-AChR mutant strain is slightly resistant \nto TC, thus revealing a third target receptor for terpenes. \nDue to the potential of EOs as sources of novel antipara -\nsitic compounds, additional studies will be carried out to \ndetermine in more detail the molecular mechanisms of \naction and structure-activity relationships of their active \ncompounds.\nMAGEC2: A NOVEL MEMBER OF THE RAS/B-RAF ONCOGENIC PATHWAY \nTO COUNTERACT THE P53 RESPONSE IN HUMAN MELANOMA\nPascucci FA,  Ladelfa F,  Escalada M,  Suberbordes M, Monte M.\nLab.

Activating mu -\ntations in Ras or B-Raf proto-oncogenes (i.e, RasV12 or \nB-RafV600E) are frequent in human melanoma. In nor -\nmal cells oncogenic Ras or B-Raf activates p53 and/or \npRb tumor suppressor response. We aimed to study the \nMAGE-I (Melanoma Antigen Genes-I) proteins involve -\nment in wt-p53 regulation in melanoma (p53 regulators \nhighly expressed in melanoma). \nHere, we identified MageC2 protein as a p53 regula -\ntor in an oncogene-activated MAPKs context. First, we \nobserved that MageC2 protein levels respond to serum \ndeprivation in cultured cells. Since growth factors activate \nRTK/Ras, we studied Ras role, and we observed  that \nRasV12 enhanced MageC2 levels depending on a func -\ntional MEK/ERK pathway by PD184352 MEK inhibitor \ntreatment. MageC2 raising did not involve MageC2 ex -\npression changes and required active proteasome as in -dicated by MG132 treatment, and accumulated MageC2 \nwas  phosphorylated only in threonine as assessed by \nanti-phospho aminoacids. To study the MageC2 role \nin p53 regulation activity in oncogene-activated MEK/\nERK condition, we generated CRISPR/CAS9 mediated \nMageC2 KO in A375 melanoma cells and we regulated \nMAPK hyperactivity with PD184352 to study p53 activity \nby its targets (p21, Mdm2 and PUMA) quantification, and  \nwe observed that MageC2 plays a key role as a down -\nstream target of the B-Raf/MAPK oncogenic pathway by \ncontrolling the p53 response. Finally, gene expression \nanalysis of TCGA skin cutaneous melanoma (n=448) \nthrough Cbioportal showed a significant inverse correla -\ntion between high MageC2 expression (RSEM>1000) \nand p53 targets expression (p21, BAX and PUMA) only \nin a Ras/B-Raf hyperactivated context (n=263). In con -\nclusion, we propose that Ras or B-Raf downregulates wt-\np53 activity by increasing MageC2 protein levels through \nthe MAPK pathway.SCIENTIFIC AWARDS SESSIONS                                                      MEDICINA (Buenos Aires) 2020; 80 (Supl.

Here we report essential \nroles of Galectin-7 (Gal-7), a b-galactoside-binding protein \npreferentially expressed in keratinocytes (KCs), in skin \ncarcinogenesis and inflammatory disorders. In a chem -\nically induced carcinogenesis model, mice constitutively \nover-expressing Gal-7 in KCs ( Tg46 mice ) showed high -\ner number (p<0.001) and earlier occurrence (p<0.001) \nof papillomas compared with WT and Lgals7-/- animals. \nIn line with transcriptomic data which showed higher \nexpression of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MD -\nSCs) recruiting chemokines in Tg46  lesions (p<0.01), \na higher frequency of MDSCs in draining lymph nodes \nfrom Tg46  mice (p<0.01), was observed. Analysis of \nRNAseq datasets from human non-melanoma skin can -\ncer lesions supported these findings. Moreover, through \nbinding to glycosylated receptors on MDSCs, Gal-7 en -\nhanced their immunosuppressive capacities (p<0.01). Two different in vivo  settings confirmed the role of M-MD -\nSCs as critical mediators of Gal-7-driven skin carcino -\ngenesis. In a different scenario -a skin inflammatory \nmodel induced by topical administration of Imiquimod \n(TLR agonist)- Lgals7-/- mice showed more severe psori -\nasis-like clinical signs compared with Tg46  and WT ani-\nmals (p<0.01). When delving into mechanistic, Gal-7, was \nfound to endow Langerhans Cells (LCs) with tolerogenic \npotential, inducing an increased secretion of TGF-b1 and \nIL-10 (p<0.05). The resulting microenvironment favoured \nthe expansion of regulatory T cells (p<0.05) thus amelio -\nrating the signs of skin inflammation. Our findings identi -\nfy Gal-7 as a multifunctional checkpoint which controlled \nexpression regulates skin homeostasis and commands \nskin fate. Whilst skin insults leading to enhanced Gal-7 \nexpression may promote skin carcinogenesis, in the op -\nposite context its down-regulation could potentiate skin \ninflammatory disorders.\nNEW THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY FOR HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA: BIOINFORMATIC IDENTIFICATION \nAND PHARMACOLOGICAL INHIBITION OF RAC1 GTPASA.\nEsteban Fiore1, Juan Bayo1, Luciana Dom\u00ednguez1, Mar\u00eda Jose Cantero1, Mat\u00edas Ciarlantini2, Mariana Malvicini3, Catalina \nAtorrasagasti1, Mariana Garc\u00eda1, Mar\u00eda Julieta Comin2, Guillermo Mazzolini1\n1 (Gene Therapy Laboratory, Instituto de Investigaciones en Medicina Traslacional, Universidad Austral - CONICET)\n2 Departamento de Ingredientes Activos y Biorrefiner\u00edas, Instituto Nacional de Tecnolog\u00eda Industrial, CONICET\n3 Cancer Immunobiology Laboratory, Instituto de Investigaciones en Medicina Traslacional, Universidad Austral - CONICET\nIntroduction: Tumors take advantage of the deregulation \nof RHO GTPases to acquire several cancer hallmarks. \nWe aimed to identify and target deregulated RHO family \nmembers in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nMethodology: Expression deregulation, clinical prog -\nnosis, and transcription programs relevant to HCC was \nstudied employing 3 public datasets (TCGA, ICGC and \nGSE14520). The therapeutic potential of RAC1 inhibitors \nwas study in vitro by MTT, apoptosis (Propidium iodide) \nand cell cycle (Annexin-V) in HCC cell line; and in vivo \nin a subcutaneous (sc) HuH7 or orthotopic Hepa129 tu -\nmor mice models. RNA-Seq analysis of RAC1 inhibition \non HuH7 cells was assessed and data correlated with \nthe HCC datasets to characterize the underlying mech -\nanism. The therapeutic effect of RAC1 inhibition on liver \nfibrosis was evaluated on Thioacetamide experimental \nmodel (600 mg/Kg/week).\nResults: Among RHO family, only RAC1 is upregulated \n(paired t-test, p<0.05), correlates with poor patient sur -vival (Kaplan-Meier, p<0.05), and is strongly linked with \na pro-oncogenic transcriptional program. From a panel \nof novel RAC1 inhibitors studied, 1D-142 was able to in -\nduce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HCC cells (2-way \nANOVA, ***p<0.001), displaying a stronger effect in high -\nly proliferative cells. Partial rescue of the RAC1-related \noncogenic transcriptional program was obtained upon \nRAC1 inhibition by 1D-142 in HCC. Strikingly, 1D-142 \ntreatment not only reduce tumor growth and survival in sc \nHuH7 tumor model (***p<0.01, 2-way ANOVA), but also \ntumor volume and intrahepatic metastasis in orthotopic \nHepa129 model (**p<0.01, t-test). Additionally, 1D-142 \ndecreases hepatic stellate cell activation and exerts an \nanti-fibrotic effect in vivo (***p<0.001, t-test).\nConclusion: By bioinformatics analysis we identify RAC1 \nas a new therapeutic target for HCC. The pharmacolog -\nical inhibition of RAC1 by 1D-142 induced a potent anti -\ntumoral effect in highly proliferative HCC established in \nfibrotic livers.MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

Autophagy, a cru -\ncial mechanism for several neutrophil functions, can be \nmodulated by immunological mediators. Besides, the \ncostimulatory molecule SLAMF1 can function as a mi -\ncrobial sensor and also interact with autophagy-related \nproteins in macrophages. Therefore, we investigated \nwhether SLAMF1 participates in neutrophil autophagy \nagainst Mtb. Neutrophils isolated from heparinized blood \nfrom TB patients and healthy donors (2x106cells/ml) \nwere infected with MtbH37Rv strain (MOI:1) during 2h or \nstimulated with Mtb-Antigen ( Mtb-Ag,10\u00b5g/ml) or differ -\nent mycobacterial compounds. In several experiments, \nSLAMF1 mAb (10\u00b5g/ml) was added to cell cultures to \nactivate this receptor. Additionally, experiments including \nNADPH-oxidase, ERK or p38 inhibitors were performed \nas well. SLAMF1 and autophagy levels were analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Interestingly, \nin concordance with bioinformatics analyses, we demon -\nstrated for the first time that Mtb induces surface expres -\nsion of SLAMF1 in human neutrophils. Moreover, we ob -\nserved that diverse mycobacterial components might be \nrecognized by these cells during Mtb infection and induce \nSLAMF1 surface expression through ROS and MAPK \nactivation (p<0,05). Furthermore, Mtb-Ag stimulation pro -\nmoted autophagy flux in human neutrophils, which was \nfurther increased by activation of SLAMF1 (p<0,01). Re -\nmarkably, TB patients\u2019 neutrophils displayed reduced lev -\nels of SLAMF1 (p<0,01) and autophagy (p<0,05) against \nMtb-Ag as compared to healthy controls. Altogether, we \nidentified SLAMF1 as an innate receptor in human neu -\ntrophils that participates in the autophagy of these cells \nduring active TB. Therefore, either inducing autophagy \nin myeloid cells or increasing Th1 responses, SLAMF1 \nwould be a key receptor in human immunity against Mtb. \nSAIC \u2013 YOUNG INVESTIGATORS BIGAND AWARD\nINTERTUMORAL HETEROGENEITY IN GLIOBLASTOMA DICTATES DIFFERENT CELLULAR REDOX STATUS \nAND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY WITH DOPED CONJUGATED \nPOLYMER NANOPARTICLES\nMat\u00edas Daniel Caverz\u00e1n  (Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Molecular - UNRC) , Luc\u00eda Beaug\u00e9  (Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Molecular - \nUNRC) , Carlos Alberto Chesta  (IITEMA (CONICET - UNRC)) , Rodrigo Emiliano Palacios  (IITEMA (CONICET - UNRC)) , Luis \nExequiel Ibarra  (INBIAS (CONICET - UNRC))\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant \ntumor of the CNS. It presents high recurrence and re -\nsistance to treatments. This leads to the search for new \ntherapies that improve the prognosis of GBM. Conjugat -\ned polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have been shown to be \nexcellent photosensitizers (PS) in Photodynamic therapy \n(PDT). We have developed metallated porphyrin-doped \nCPNs for PDT. GBM presents inter and intratumoral cel -\nlular and genetic heterogeneity which include the adap -\ntation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and could be ex -\npressed as different basal levels of oxidative stress and \nantioxidant enzymes. The tumor heterogeneity and their \nassociated difference in sensitivity to ROS-producing \ntherapeutic agents must be taken into account in design -\ning PDT protocols. Catalase (CAT), glutathione reduc -\ntase (GSR) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) mRNA expressions in GBM samples were remarkably higher \nthan that in normal tissues (GEPIA database). These ex -\npression patterns were used as biomarkers to predict the \nperformance of CPN-PDT. CPN-PDT efficacy was com -\npared in different GBM cell lines with different initial re -\ndox status. Basal mRNA expression levels of GSR, CAT \nand SOD2 were similar between U-87 MG and MO59K. \nHowever, T98G showed the highest levels for the 3 an -\ntioxidant enzymes. The inherent ROS level, quantified \nby DCFDA probe, was the lowest in T98G compared to \nthe other two GBM cell lines. Cells were incubated with \nCPNs at various concentrations and subsequently irra -\ndiated with a MultiLED system. Cells not incubated with \nCPN were viable at all light doses, while a significant \ntoxic effect was found in all cell lines after PDT. MO59K \nand U-87 MG cells died at a CPN concentration and light AWARDS39\ndose-dependent manner with very similar IC50 values. \nHowever, T98G cells were significantly more resistant to \nCNP-PDT. The superior resistance of T98G cells could be attributed to their higher antioxidant enzyme genes \nexpression levels before and immediately after PDT.\nMETABOLIC LIPOTOXICITY-INDUCED NEUROINFLAMMATION: POTENTIAL ROLE \nOF GLIAL CELLS INTERACTION VIA EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES\nVinuesa A1,2, Bellotto M1,2, Bentivegna M1,2, Gregosa A1,2, Pomilio C1,2, Presa J1,2, Beauquis J1,2, Saravia F1,2\n1 Instituto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental (IBYME) \n2 Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica \u2013 Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales \u2013 Universidad de Buenos Aires\nObesity and related metabolic disorders are important \nrisk factors for brain aging, promoting alterations in the \nplasticity of limbic structures such as the hippocampus. \nAmong the underlying mechanisms, chronic inflammation \nand insulin resistance are crucial factors, also associated \nwith alterations of sphingolipid metabolism. Taking this \ninto account, we intend to study mechanisms associated \nwith the impact of metabolic disturbances on the brain. \nWe aim to assess the inflammatory response induced by \na lipotoxic context and the communication between gli -\nal cells mediated by the release of extracellular vesicles \n(EVs) as vehicles of damage propagation.\nWe previously found that C57BL/6 mice exposed to a \nhigh fat diet (HFD) presented neuroinflammation, de -\ncreased neurogenesis and structural synaptic alter -\nations, together with spatial memory impairment. To as -\nsess potential mechanisms involved, we used an in vitro  \napproach emulating the lipotoxic context with the saturat -\ned fatty acid palmitate (PA). Microglial cultures exposed to PA showed a pro-inflammatory profile and, after purifi -\ncation of EVs from the conditioned media (CM), we found \nthat exosomes altered dendritic spine morphology of hip -\npocampal neurons. Here, we show that in the presence \nof ceramide synthesis inhibitor Cambinol, the induced \nexpression of IL1\u03b2 in PA-exposed BV2 microglial cells \nwas diminished (p<0.05). In the same line, Cambinol \nseemed to prevent the decreased phagocytic capacity of \nBV2 cells exposed to PA. Finally, regarding the interac -\ntion between glial cells, preliminary results showed that \nCM from PA-stimulated BV2 cells was able to induce the \nexpression of IL1\u03b2 in C6 astrocytic cell line. Interestingly, \nafter EVs isolation, exosomes derived from PA-microglia \nexerted the same effect. \nOur results suggest a role of ceramide pathway in the \ninflammatory context induced by PA and the potential in -\nvolvement of exosome-like EVs in the propagation of the \ndamage response between glial cells.\nTHE ONCOGENIC ROLE OF P63 AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION OF \nBLADDER TUMORS\nCatalina Lodillinsky \n(Area de Investigaci\u00f3n-Instituto de Oncolog\u00eda A.H.Roffo)\nA new classification of muscle-invasive bladder cancer \n(MIBCs) has been proposed. The over-expression or \nthe activating mutations in the Fibroblast Growth Fac -\ntor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) are associated with the luminal \nsubtype while basal MIBCs are characterized by p63 \nactivation. Even so, the gene regulatory pathway of an \naltered-FGFR3 and a functional validation of p63 in blad -\nder cancer (BC) remains poorly characterized and it is \ntherefore our main aim. Loss of p63 led to a decreased \n2D and 3D growth in cell lines bearing FGFR3 mutations \n(p<0.001). Gelatin degradation and migration ability in \np63 depleted cells are significantly lower compared CRL \n(p<0,01). Later on, tumor volume was significantly lower \nin p63 depleted tumors compared CRL (p<0.01) indicat -\ning that p63 is an essential protein through which the cell \nmediates its proliferative and migratory mechanism. A \np63 decreased levels together with a blunted cell migra -\ntion was observed following the FGFR3 pharmacological \ninhibition while no variations in protein levels or cell mi -gration have been observed in FGFR3 WT cells. Overall, \nthese results suggested that p63 mediates cell migration \nin FGFR3-dependent cells. Supporting the regulation of \np63 by FGFR3, analysis of mRNA levels in human blad -\nder tumors showed that p63 expression was significantly \nhigher in tumors mutated for FGFR3. Moreover, higher \np63 levels in patients with mutated FGFR3 is associated \nwith worse prognosis compared to ones with lower p63 \nlevels. In order to identify p63-involved molecular targets \nin cells bearing FGFR3 mutations, several molecular \npathways inhibition downstream of FGFR3 were carried \nout and p63 expression and cell proliferation in 2D and \n3D were analyzed. Inhibition of PI3K pathway showed \nthe best and most sustained effect over time (p<0.001). \nHere we demonstrated for the first time that p63 medi -\nates tumor growth, cell proliferation and migration of FG -\nFR3-dependent BC cells which could be block by target -\ning PI3K molecular pathway.MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

Objectives: 1) To describe and \nanalyze STEC  fecal shedding duration. 2) To evaluate \nthe association between STEC excretion duration and \nsex, age, dialysis requirement, antibiotics and STEC se -\nrotype. Population and Methods: Prospective, observa -\ntional, longitudinal and analytic study. Period 2013-2019. \nStool cultures were performed at admission and every 5 \nto 7 days until 2 negative samples were obtained. The \nduration of STEC shedding was defined as the interval \nbetween the diarrhea onset and the first of two consec -\nutive negative stool cultures. STEC infection was con -\nfirmed by screening of stx1, stx2 y rfbO157 genes by \npolymerase chain reaction assays.\nPatients without stool culture or with a negative result were excluded and those who did not deliver stool sam -\nples were eliminated. Mean (95% CI) and percentiles \nof STEC   fecal shedding duration were calculated and \ncompared between the different variables studied by \nT-test. Results: Out a total of 88 patients, 37 were ex -\ncluded, 8 were eliminated and 43 were included. Mean \nfecal shedding was 10.2 days (CI 95% 8.92-11.59).  \nNinety percent of the patients had negative cultures af -\nter 15 days.

Dis -\nease etiology is under debate, and it is not clear if LCH \nresults from malignant transformation or unbalanced \nimmune response. Previously, we found CD207+CD1a+ \ncirculating cells in patients with active LCH with an im -\nportant prognostic potential. We aimed to validate a rap -\nid detection method of blood circulating CD1a+CD207+ \ncells to define a cellular disease activity in pediatric LCH \npatients and correlate with organ location and gene ex -\npression. CD207 and CD1a levels were measured in \n7 blood myeloid compartments by flow cytometry. 188 \npediatric LCH blood samples and 22 controls were an -\nalyzed. Survival and migration genes were evaluated in \nsorted circulating myeloid cells by RT-qPCR. We found \nCD207+ and/or CD1a+ circulating cells in all active LCH \npatients, while controls and non-active LCH patients \nwere negative. We established a cellular activity score adding the percentage of CD207+/CD1a+ cells in each \nof the 7 myeloid compartments, which was validated by \nROC curve analysis (AUC:0.81, Sen.:0.79, Spe.:0.77, \nY.Index:29.5). LCH patients with a score higher than 29 \nwere categorized as cellular active disease. Multivari -\nate analysis showed specific CD207+/CD1a+ cell popu -\nlations correlate with organ localization. Bone LCH was \ndefined by CD1a+ in CD11bHCD14L/CD11c-CD1c+. Skin \nLCH showed CD1a+CD207+ cells in CD11bHCD11cH/CD-\n11b+CD11cL populations. Multisystem patients presented \nCD207+ cells in CD11bHCD14H/CD11bHCD14L/CD11c-\nCD1c+. We also observed a differential gene expression \nof IL7R, SNAIL, NCAD and MMP1/9 dependent on organ \ncompromise. Summarizing, we propose a rapid method \nto detect pathological CD207+CD1a+ cells in LCH pa -\ntient\u2019s peripheral blood and define a cellular activity score \nas an instrument to follow-up the activity disease, even \nbefore clinical manifestations, and potentially predict or -\ngan compromise.

Imbalances in T cells\u00b4s me -\ntabolism can be detrimental. The aim of our work was \nto evaluate metabolic and mitochondrial parameters in \nCD4 T cells during T. cruzi infection. To achieve this, CD4 \nT cells were isolated from spleen of non-infected (NI), \nacute (AP) and chronic (CP) infected BALB/c mice, with \n500 trypomastigotes. Mitochondrial parameters were \nmeasured by FACS combining potential-dependent and \nindependent probes while mitochondrial ROS (mROS) \nwas measured using MitoSOX. Seahorse XF24 was \nemployed for bioenergetics analysis. We found a raised \nbasal glycolysis and high oxidative metabolism in CD4 T \ncells from the AP. Besides, these cells showed increased \nproton leak and uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) expression \nthat correlates with our previous results that demon -\nstrated mROS accumulation, mitochondrial membrane \npotential depolarization, PD1 expression and less IL-2 released (analyzed by ELISA) after stimulation during AP \nof infection. Furthermore, CD4 T cells with mitochondrial \nalterations (MA) displayed an activated phenotype, and \nwere more prone to apoptosis. This phenotype was de -\npendent on TCR signalling, since MA in CD4 T cells from \nAP were significantly reduced in OTII mice. Mn-Super -\noxide Dismutase expression, involved in mROS detoxi -\nfication, was increase during the AP and CP of infection. \nApoptosis observed in CD4 T cells with depolarized mi -\ntochondria, was prevented by incubation with N-acetyl \ncysteine (NAC). It is probably that antioxidant availability \nmay not be sufficient to avoid MA rendering these cells \nmore susceptible to apoptosis. Thus, our results showed \nthat acute infection triggers an exacerbated metabolism \ntogether with mROS production in CD4 T cells.

Secretory IgA (SIgA) is \na heavily glycosylated protein complex that plays a key \nrole in maintaining gut immune homeostasis. H owever, \nfunctional consequences of an altered SIgA glycosyla -\ntion during gut inflammation have not been addressed \nyet. Our goal was to evaluate a potentially  aberrant \nglycosylation of plasma cells (PCs) and SIgA , focusing \ninto its pathol ogical  relevance. Analysis from single cell \nRNA seq databases on PCs from IBD patients  showed  \nan altered  N-glycosylation machinery. Considering that \nDSS-induced colitis  showed  decreased  \u03b12,6 sialylation \n(\u03b12,6sia) specifically on IgA+ PCs (p < 0,05) and SIgA in \nvivo, we investigated the functionality of B cells deficient \nin ST6Gal1, an enzyme that adds \u03b12,6sia to N-glycans.  \nST6Gal1-/- B cells are impaired in their ability to suppress \nT cell driven colitis in Rag2-/- mice, resulting in greater his -tologic score than their wild type counterparts (p < 0,05). \nTo unravel the mechanisms involved in the defective reg -\nulation of inflammation , we focused in analyzing the func -\ntionality of \u03b12,6sia -deficient SIgA. Notably, desialylated \nSIgA show ed higher binding to fecal bacteria (p < 0,05) \nand human monocytes (p < 0,05) in vitro  and potentiates \nthe activation of LPS-stimulated monocytes , upregulat -\ning HLA-DR and IL-1\u03b2 (p < 0,05). Moreover, b inding of \ndesialylated SIgA to THP-1 monocytic cells is inhibited  by \nEGTA and Lewis X (p < 0,05), suggesting th at these in -\nteractions  are mediated by a  C-type lectin. The evidence \nprovided here postulates a novel immune circuit where \ngut inflammation may promote transcriptional changes in \nPCs resulting in decreased \u03b12,6sia. In turn, desialylated  \nSIgA promotes colitis through a newly gained proinflam -\nmatory activity . This work  contributes to the construction \nof a new paradigm  where  aberrant glycosylation modu -\nlates the immunoregulatory activity of SIgA.MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

The potentiation of immune action again this tumor \nwill be a promising therapeutic option. Monocytes/mac -\nrophages (Mo/M\u00d8) are critical modulators of the tumor \nmicroenvironment. Chemically modified hyaluronan (HA) \nlike sulfated hyaluronan (sHA) are biomaterials that can \nwork as a possible adjuvant therapy. It demonstrated that \nsHA can inhibit hyaluronidases and have a potent antitu -\nmor and antiangiogenic action in prostate and bladder \ncancer cells. In this sense, the aim is to evaluate sHA \neffect on breast tumor cells and on Mo/M\u00d8 in tumor con -\ntext.\nM&M. sHA (sHA1 and sHA3)  were synthesized from \nthe tetrabutyl ammonium salt of HA in Fidia Farmaceu -\ntici s.p.a. Cells: i)human breast cancer cell line (MDA-\nMB-231), ii)human microvascular endothelium (HMEC-\n1) and iii)Mo/M\u00d8 (obtain from human peripheric blood \nwith Ficoll/Percoll). MTS assay was used to measure \ncell viability. LDH assay was used to measure cytotoxic -ity. TGF\u03b21 and VEGF levels were measured by ELISA. \nVEGF, FGF-2 and IL8 levels were measured by qPCR. \nCell migration was evaluated using a modified Boyden \nchamber. Mammospheres were obtained through hang -\ning drop.

Whereas, sHA \ntreatments in Mo/M\u00d8 in breast tumor context increased \nMo/M\u00d8 viability, decreased TGF\u03b21 total levels, modulat -\ned TSG-6 and decreased the expression of angiogen -\nic factors and HMEC-1 migration. Even more, Mo/M\u00d8 \nprimed with sHA and inoculated breast tumor model de -\ncreased blood vessel formation, TSG-6 and HA levels.\nConclusion. sHA showed an antitumor and antiangio -\ngenic role in breast tumor cells, as well as in Mo/M\u00d8 in \nbreast cancer context.\nSAFIS AWARD\nAEROBIC TRAINING-INDUCED MITOCHONDRIAL ADAPTATIONS IN HYPERTENSIVE MYOCARDIUM\nGodoy Coto J1, Yeves AM1, Pereyra EV1, Ennis IL1. \n1: Centro de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares \u201cDr. Horacio E. Cingolani\u201d \u2013 Universidad Nacional de La Plata \u2013 CONICET.\nPathological cardiac remodeling occurs in essential hy -\npertension and consists of ultrastructural alterations and \nmitochondrial dysfunction. Physiological cardiac adapta -\ntions occur in response to aerobic training to satisfy the \nwork-load during exercise. Despite this, its beneficial ef -\nfects on the mitochondria have not been completely elu -\ncidated in the hypertensive myocardium. \nObjective . To determine whether sustained swimming \ntraining improves myocardial mitochondrial phenotype in \nspontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). \nMethods . 3-month old SHR were randomized to seden -\ntary (Sed) and trained (Swim) groups. After the swimming \nprotocol (8 weeks, 5 days/week) the hearts were des -\ntined for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imag -\ning, RT-PCR analysis, or mitochondrial isolation. Results \nare expressed as mean\u00b1SEM (TEM as median-IQR) and \nare statistically different (p<0.05), otherwise, the p-value \nwas stated. \nResults . TEM images showed increased morphological \nvalues in Swim group: cross-sectional area (\u03bcm2, Swim: 0.79-0.74, Sed: 0.72-0.71) and aspect ratio (Swim: \n1.90-1.13, Sed: 1.60-0.77). The myocardial ultrastruc -\ntural disarray in Sed trended to be restored by training \n(clusters/photo, Swim: 4.63\u00b11.07, Sed: 8.45 \u00b1 0.84, \np=0.057). Training modified mitochondrial dynamics (% \nvs Sed): mtDNA/nDNA: 153.9\u00b121.6 (p=0.082); PGC1-\u03b1: \n149.19\u00b119; DRP-1: 309.4\u00b177.5; MFN1: 59.0\u00b18.2; PINK1: \n209.9\u00b149.4 (p=0.063). Moreover, training improved: \n\u0394\u03a8m (mV, Swim: -175.2\u00b15.8, Sed: -148.6\u00b19.2), mito -\nchondrial calcium content (nmol/mg, Swim: 151.4\u00b121.6, \nSed: 87.6\u00b117.8), and citrate synthase activity (\u03bcmol/\nmin*mg, Swim: 0.87\u00b10.03, Sed: 0.64\u00b10.05). \nConclusion. These results suggest that aerobic training: \n1) improved the mitochondrial-sarcomere array; 2) pro -\nmoted a dysfunctional mitochondrial clearance process: \nreduced fusion and enhanced biogenesis, fission, and \nmitophagy; and 3) improved mitochondrial phenotype \nthrough less depolarized \u0394\u03a8m, increased mitochondrial \nCa+2 and citrate synthase activity.AWARDS43\nINHIBITION OF THE TRANSLOCON IS SUFFICIENT TO ALLEVIATE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM STRESS \nAND IMPROVE THE POST-ISCHEMIC RECOVERY OF THE STUNNED MYOCARDIUM.\nJuan Ignacio Elio Mari\u00e1ngelo, Leticia Vittone, Matilde Said, Cecilia Mundi\u00f1a-Weilenmann\nCentro de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares, CCT CONICET La Plata, Facultad de Ciencias M\u00e9dicas, UNLP.\nMyocardial stunning is a temporary contractile dysfunc -\ntion after the relief of a discrete ischemia. Oxidative \nstress and intracellular Ca2+ overload are proposed for \nthe pathogenesis of this phenomenon. The endoplasmic \nreticulum (ER), involved in folding and sorting of proteins, \nis also a Ca2+ storage compartment sensitive to alter -\nations in intracellular homeostasis. The perturbation in \nER function leads to accumulation of misfolded proteins, \nER stress, activation of the unfolded protein response \n(UPR) and frequently ER Ca2+ loss. In stunned hearts, \nthe triggered ER stress impairs the post-ischemic myo -\ncardial performance. Since ER Ca2+ release could par -\nticipate in the altered Ca2+ homeostasis, we explored \nwhether the translocon, an ER Ca2+ leak channel, con -\ntributes to the contractile dysfunction.\nMechanical performance, UPR markers and oxidative \ndamage of perfused rat hearts subjected to 20 min of \nischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion in absence \n(I/R) or presence of the translocon inhibitor, Emetine (I/\nR+E,1 mM) (n=4-7), were evaluated.Emetine precluded the I/R-induced increase in relative \nmRNA levels of two UPR signaling markers: GRP78 \n1.79\u00b10.09 (I/R) vs 1.16\u00b10.19 (I/R+E) and sXBP1 \n2.14\u00b10.21 (I/R) vs 1.12\u00b10.15 (I/R+E), P< 0.05. The con -\ntractile recovery significantly improved together with a \nremarkable attenuation in myocardial stiffness. At the \nend of reperfusion, left ventricular developed pressure \nvalues (% of pre-ischemia) were 45.63\u00b13.16 (I/R) and \n105.68\u00b16.34 (I/R+E) while left ventricular end diastol -\nic pressure values (mmHg) were 48.40\u00b11.87 (I/R) and \n14.89\u00b14.81 (I/R+E). This occurred despite more severe \noxidative stress conditions than that elicited by non-treat -\ned I/R hearts [TBARS (nmol/mgprot) 0.71\u00b10.06 (I/R) vs \n0.97\u00b10.09 (I/R+E)].\nIn conclusion, blocking ER Ca2+depletion via translocon \nsuppressed ER stress and produced a beneficial effect \non the mechanical performance of stunned myocardi -\num even in the absence of any attenuation of oxidative \nstress.\nSR-MITOCHONDRIA COMMUNICATION PROMOTES MITOCHONDRIAL DAMAGE \nAND TISSUE DISARRANGEMENT IN PREDIABETIC HEARTS\nMarilen Federico1, Maite Zavala1, Tamara Vico2, Enrique Portiansky3, Sof\u00eda L\u00f3pez, Silvia Alvarez, Celeste Villa Abrille, \nJulieta Palomeque \n1.

Prediabetic hearts \npresent Ca2+ mishandling by CaMKII (Ca2+-Calmodulin \nkinase II) hyperactivity. Mitochondrial Ca2+ overload can \nopen mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) \nand trigger cell death. We hypothesize that SR Ca2+ \nleak through RyR2 and the decreased distance between \norganelles in a CaMKII-dependent pathway, induce a \ndecreased mitochondrial Ca2+ retention capacity (CRC) \ninducing mitochondrial damage.\nWe measured spontaneous Ca2+ release events \n(SCaRE), RyR2 activity by [3H]Ryanodine binding as -\nsay, mitochondrial CRC, O2 consumption and ATP and \nH2O2 production, mitochondrial morphology and fission/\nfusion processes in a prediabetic model induced by fruc -\ntose-rich diet (FRD) in WT and AC3I mice (express a \nCaMKII-inhibitor at heart level).\nWe found significantly increased SCaRE and RyR2 ac -\ntivity in WT FRD vs CD, without changes in AC3I hearts. \nIncreased expression of Mfn2, VDAC and Grp75, tether proteins that could explain the decreased distance be -\ntween organelles, was found in WT FRD vs CD.\nIn isolated mitochondria, O2 consumption in state 4 was \nincreased with a decreased respiratory control ratio and \nwithout changes in ATP production. Moreover, H2O2 \nproduction rate was increased. Transmission electron \nmicroscopy photographs showed decreased mitochon -\ndria size and number, plus a clear disarrangement in the \ntissue of WT FRD vs CD. DRP1 was found increased \nand without changes in Opa1 in WT FRD vs CD.\nWe conclude that CaMKII hyperactivity induces SR Ca2+ \nleak by RyR2 hyperactivity, which in turn increases mito -\nchondrial Ca2+ content and decreases CRC due to, at \nleast in part, the nearness between the two organelles. \nBesides, the ETC is partially uncoupled and H2O2 pro -\nduction increases in agreement with mitochondrial frag -\nmentation and tissue disarrangement. These events are \nprevented in AC3I mice, where myocardial CaMKII is ge -\nnetically inhibited.MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

PUFAs can affect membrane\u00b4s lipid composition, as \nwell as proteins\u00b4 location and/or function. The Na+/H+ \nexchanger (NHE1) is an integral membrane protein in -\nvolved in maintenance of intracellular pH (pHi). Its activ -\nity is regulated by allosteric site sensitivity for H+, phos -\nphorylation and by union of ATP, lipids, growth factors in \nits cytoplasmic tail.\nThe purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of \nearly supplementing in diet with EPA and DHA over \nthe modulation of NHE1 activity and cardiac function in \nnormo rats (Wistar, W) and spontaneous hypertensive \n(SHR).\nAfter weaning, the animals received orally EPA and DHA \nfor three months (200 mg/kg body mass/day). Then we \nmeasured systolic pressure (SP) and different echocar -\ndiography parameters, which was used to calculated left ventricular mass index (LVMI), ejection fraction (EF%) \nand fractional shortening (FS%). The rats were sacrificed \nand obtain ventricular cardiomyocytes for measured the \nNHE1 activity.\nThe SP was significantly greater in SHR compared to W. \nWhile the treatment with PUFAs did not affect the SP in \nSHR, we observed a significant reduction in LVMI.\nThe NHE1 activity was measured as velocity of pHi re -\ncovery (dpHi/dt) after intracellular acidification. As is \npreviously described, the NHE1 activity was significant -\nly higher in SHR compared with W. NHE1 activity was \nnot modified by the treatment with PUFA in W. Howev -\ner, NHE1 activity was significant decreased by PUFA in \nSHR, reaching values comparable with W.\nThese preliminary results allow us to suggest that diet \nsupplementation with PUFAs since early age in SHR pre -\nvents the development of cardiac hypertrophy, perhaps \nby decreasing NHE1 activity, without altering hemody -\nnamic overload.ABSTRACTS45\nSAIC\nBIOINFORM\u00c1TICA, GENOMA, PROTEOMA, \nY BLANCOS TERAP\u00c9UTICOS\n1.

HPLC and flow \ninjection analysis with MS/MS in tandem was applied for metabo -\nlomic studies using the MxP Quant 500 Kit (Biocrates Life Scienc -\nes AG, Austria) and MetaboAnalyst v4.0. Bivariate and multivariate \nanalyses identified variables independently related to NAFLD stage. \nForward stepwise logistic regression models were constructed to \ndiagnose NAFLD and NASH.

Levels \nof triglycerides (TG) were higher among NAFLD patients, whereas \nlevels of phosphatidylcholines (PC) and lysoPC were lower among \nthem. The PNPLA3 risk genotype was related to higher plasma \nlevels of eicosenoic acid FA(20:1) (p<0.001). Plasma metabolites \nshowed a higher accuracy for diagnosis of NAFLD and NASH (AU -\nROC=1) than stool metabolites (AUROC=0.79 and 0.90, respective -\nly). Body mass index and plasma levels of PC aa C24:0, FA(20:1) \nand TG(16:1_34:1) showed high accuracy for diagnosis of NAFLD \n(AUROC=1); whereas plasma levels of PC aa C24:0 and PC ae C40:1 showed AUROC=1 for discriminating NAFLD stages.\nIn conclusion, potential metabolomic biomarkers for diagnosis and \nprogression of NAFLD were identified in Argentina.

However, \nits role in thyroid cancer (TC) progression has not yet been stud -\nied. TC has been dramatically rising worldwide in recent decades \nand represents the most prevalent endocrine malignancy. For this \nreason, we have begun analyzing GEF-H1 expression in human \nthyroid biopsies. We observed higher cytoplasmic protein concen -\ntration when comparing by immunohistochemistry tumor tissue (TT) \nwith non-malignant tissue (NMT) (n=52; p=0.0003). Similar results \nwere obtained by Western blot in thyroid biopsies and cancer cell \nlines. Furthermore, clinical-histopathological data showed signifi -\ncant GEF-H1 overexpression in TT than NMT (p=7E-07), which cor -\nrelates with a less patient survival (p=0.0088). mRNA data analysis \nfrom biopsies (Human Protein Atlas and Oncomine platforms) also \nshowed a significant GEF-H1 overexpression in TT compared with \nNMT. Analyzing Gene Expression Omnibus microarray data with R \nlanguage, we observed that GEF-H1 is between 2-17% of the most \nexpressed genes in different TC histotypes. We also determined that \nGEF-H1 expression is significantly higher in papillary and anaplas -\ntic carcinomas than NMT (p<0.05) and its expression increased in \npapillary carcinomas with lymph node invasion and/or metastasis \n(p<0.001). Moreover, we looked for those genes whose mRNA ex -\npression correlates with GEF-H1 and we evaluated their function \nthrough gene ontology analysis (DAVID and STRING platforms) and \ntheir participation in signaling pathways (KEGG and Reactome). \nGenes associated with migration, mechanical signaling, cytoskele -\nton remodeling and focal adhesions positive correlated with GEF-H1 \nexpression in TC (p<0.001). The results suggest that GEF-H1 might \nbe a potential tumor biomarker and/or therapeutic target in TC, since \nit would be involved in the pro-tumorigenic signaling by coordinating \nchanges in cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion.\n4.

Better diagnostic and prognostic tools for OS disease \nprogression are in need. Here we propose the use of micro-RNAs \n(miRNAs) as alternative diagnostic biomarkers for OS. MiRNAs are \nsmall and stable non-coding RNAs that can be obtained from liquid \nbiopsies of different body fluids such as plasma, which in the last \nyears have been proposed as diagnostic and prognostic biomark -\ners. The aim of this work was to assess an OS miRNAs database \nand contrast it with our own molecular and functional profiling in an \nOS model with metastatic behavior, in order to propose possible \nmiRNAs as biomarker candidates. We analyzed circulating miRNAs \npresent in the plasma of 15 healthy donors and 20 OS patients (10 \nwith localized OS and 10 with metastatic OS) using the miRNAs \ndataset GSE65071. Our analysis revealed that miR-34a-5p, -200a-\n3p, -582-5p, -624-5p and let-7a-3p were upregulated in OS patients \nplasma as compared to healthy donors (fold change: 0.43; 0.78; \n0.78; 0.95; 0.5 respectively; p < 0.0001), while miR-27a-3p and \n-221-3p were found downregulated in the plasma of OS patients as \ncompared to healthy donors (fold change: -0.73; -2.64 respectively; \np < 0.0001). There was no difference in expression between local -\nized and metastatic OS for these miRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis of \nthe target genes of these miRNAs revealed that they are implicated \nin the regulation of different cancer-related biological pathways like ECM- receptor interaction, cell cycle control and EMT, in coincidence \nwith our proteomic approach on metastatic and non-metastatic OS \ncells. These results strengthen the in-silico search and constitute a \nproof of concept on the use of this cross-omic approach as a tool for \nthe identification of potential miRNAs as liquid biopsy biomarkers for \ndiseases characterized by scarce extensive population-based data.\n5.

We queried ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from \nPDAC cell lines available at public repositories including the Gene \nExpression Omnibus (GEO) and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements \n(ENCODE), analyzing Abcc4 mRNA levels and the associated epi -\ngenetic landscape of histone marks with clear functions in gene ex -\npression: H3K27ac/H3K4me for cis-regulatory elements indicative \nof active clusters of transcription factors (TFs), H3K4me3 for active \npromoters, H3K9me3 for silenced heterochromatin, and the TFs re -\nported bound at those genomic locations. All cell lines presented \nH3K4me3 enrichment at the Abcc4 promoter and were depleted of \nH3K9me3. The high Abcc4-expressing cell lines, such as PANC1, \nconsistently showed H3K27ac/H3K4me enrichment at specific lo -\ncations of intron1, which were not detected in low Abcc4-express -\ning cell lines, such as HPAF2. We overlapped these regions with \nthe TFs peaks reported in high Abcc4-expressing CFPAC1 cell line \nand defined three TFs clusters for further analysis. We generated \nHPAF2, BxPC3 and PANC1 xenografted tumors in NGS mice and \nevaluated Abcc4 mRNA expression (RT-PCR) and chromatin en -\nrichment (ChIP-PCR) of H3K27ac, FoxA1 and GATA2 at the intron1 \nclusters. We found Abcc4 mRNA levels as expected: low in HPAF2 \nand increased in BxPC3 and PANC1. H3K27ac showed enrichment \nat the three clusters in all tumors, indicative of active/poised state, \nbut only high Abcc4-expressing BxPC3 and PANC1 showed enrich -\nment of FoxA1/GATA2 at these genomic locations. FoxA1 was found \nenriched at all clusters only in BxPC3. GATA2 showed enrichment \nat clusters 2 and 3 in BxPC3 and PANC1, and at cluster 1 only in \nPANC1. These findings suggest that FoxA1 and GATA2 may con -\ntribute to aberrant Abcc4 expression, PDAC aggressiveness and \nprogression. \n6.

Instituto de I+D en Bioingenier\u00eda y Bioinform\u00e1tica (IB -\nB)-UNER-CONICET. \nINTRO: Dysregulation of kallikrein-bradykinin pathway has been \nlinked to hyperinflammatory phase of several lung infections causing \nadult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) including COVID-19, \nSARS, MERS and Hantavirus Respiratory Syndrome. The inject -\nable synthetic decapeptide Icatibant (Firazyr) is the only currently \napproved antagonist for B2-bradykinin receptor (B2-bkR), but its ABSTRACTS47\nhigh cost makes it prohibitive for most healthcare systems of the \nregion, particularly in the current pandemic context. AIM: To find \nsmall oral bioavailable, non-peptidic repurposing drug candidates \nfor competitive inhibition of B2-bkR. M&M: By using 3 refined atomic \nmodels of B2-bkR obtained by homology and threading methods \n(SWISS-model/FG-MD and GPCR-I-TASSER) a high-throughput \nmolecular docking (AutoDockVina) virtual screening was performed \nagainst all 2893 FDA-Approved, 3153 Investigational, 2414 in-tri -\nals and 440 harmless natural compounds (Drug Bank). Strong \nbinders ( \ud835\udee5Gbinding \u2264 -11kcal/mol) were later scored by integrating the \nligand-receptor contact forces (AutoDock tools, LigPlus) with the \navailable toxicity, pharmacokinetic (FK) and pharmacodynamic (FD) \ndata. By means of a high performance computing system (FIUNER \ncluster: 10 nodes, with 24 cores each), 20 nanoseconds molecular \ndynamics simulations (MDS) were run for top-10 ranked ligand-re -\nceptor complexes (NAMD/VMD). MDS trajectories were analysed \nby uni- and multivariate statistics using RMSD, RMSF, H-bonding \nand 2D-PCA as reaction coordinates (R). RESULTS & DISCUS -\nSION: Starting from a large library of compounds, virtual screening \nachieved 41 putative ligands which, after filtering by FD, FK and \nthermodynamic criteria lead us to 6 oral-bioavailable and cost-effec -\ntive promissory repurposing drugs. In order to experimentally test \nthese candidates, a live cell imaging Ca2+ mobilization inhibition bio -\nassay is under implementation.\n7.

Hospital Provincial Neuqu\u00e9n \u201cDr. \nCastro Rend\u00f3n\u201d.\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is a frequently lethal disease with hetero -\ngeneous outcomes and drug responses. Multiomics studies have re -\nvealed the molecular landscape of CRC, enabling the classification \nof patients according to 4 consensus molecular subtypes (CMS1-4). \nCMS1-immune comprises most tumors with MSI.  CMS2-canonical \nand CMS3-metabolic both show epithelial characteristics. CMS4 \ncomprises the more mesenchymal-like cancers, with poor patient \nprognosis. CMS1 and CMS4 also show poor response to standard \ntherapies. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute more than 70% of \nthe transcriptome. Two main classes have been largely associated \nwith cancer; miRNAs and lncRNAs. Since some of these ncRNAs \ncan be detected in human body fluid and have good specificity and \naccessibility, they have been suggested to be used as novel poten -\ntial biomarkers for CRC diagnosis and prognosis as well as in the \nprediction of the response to therapy. In this study, we performed \na classification of 688 CRC tumors obtained from TCGA into the 4 \nCMS employing the CMScaller bioinformatics tool. We character -\nized each subtype according to its main features. We then conduct -\ned an exhaustive gene expression profile analysis to identify the top \nupregulated lncRNAs and mature miRNAs in each subtype (CMSk) \ncompared to the rest of the groups (CMSk-1; pvalue<0.01), defining \na CRC-CMS signature of ncRNAs. Applying different filtering crite -\nria, we look for those ncRNAs with potential clinical implications. \nWe identified two lncRNAs, AFAP1-AS1 and MIR99AHG, overex -\npressed in CMS1 and CMS4 (p<0.01), respectively, and associated \nto poor prognosis (p<0.05); and three miRNAs: miR-99a-5p, let-7c-\n5p, and miR-125b-5p, all upregulated in CMS4 and associated to \nbad prognosis (p<0.05). Overall, we defined the most relevant CMS \nspecific lncRNAs and miRNAs in CRC, and selected a group of can -\ndidates with clinical implications to further evaluate in-vitro in CRC \ncell lines and ex-vivo in blood and tumors patient samples.\n8.

Data were \nanalyzed following GATK guidelines (GRCh37/HG19 reference). \nDetection algorithms: HaplotypeCaller v3.3.0 for germline SNP; Mu -\ntect2 v3.8-0 for somatic SNPs/INDELs; FACETS v0.6.0 for CNV. Dif -\nferential alterations in the allelic frequency (AF) of SNP/INDELs as \nwell as in the cellular fraction (CF) of copy-number-variation (CNV) \nwere discerned in genes with impact on cancer hallmarks in each \nstep of tumor transformation and progression.\nResults: Germline trunk mutations with known effect on susceptibili -\nty and poor-prognosis in CM were detected, early affecting genome \nstability (n=60). Regarding somatic gene alterations, CNV prevailed \nover SNP/INDELs, both showing an increasing number of affected \ngenes in the path from nevi to metastasis. Accordingly, TMB tripled \nwith progression (2.875X). The main somatic trunk driver was the \noncogene BRAFV600E, with an increasing AF and CF in primary \nand LN-mts, sustaining proliferative signaling. At CNV level, dele -\ntion prevailed over gene amplification (8.42X). Metastasis-persist -\ning genes exhibited increasing CF variation throughout progression \n(1.65X), supporting a functional selection of these altered-genes. \nAmplified genes (n=494) mainly affected cell proliferation, invasion \n& metastasis, angiogenesis and metabolism hallmarks. While delet -\ned genes (n=4161) mainly affected regulation of cell proliferation, \ncell death and immunity hallmarks.\nConclusion: in this gradual although rapidly-progressing CM case, \nWES analysis allowed us to disguised differential alterations with \nimpact on cancer hallmarks in each step of tumor transformation \nand progression.\n9.

The chromosome \n(5.315.598 bp) and the pSCH909 plasmid (83.750 bp) were assem -\nbled with SPAdes  3.9.0. The genome was annotated with Prodigal \nand RefSeq database for the genome annotation which was com -\npleted with specific analysis by using Blast.

These \nfindings, and the fact that S. marcescens is considered a relevant \nnosocomial pathogen that can have a wide range of niches \u2013human, \nplant, animal, soil, and inanimate surfaces, showed the ability of this \nspecies to capture, maintain and spread a broad variety of antimi -\ncrobial resistance platforms.\n10.

The emergence of multi -\ndrug-resistant strains is an increasing danger to public health. \nUtilizing whole-genome sequencing, we characterized the popula -\ntion structure and variation, as well as the antimicrobial resistance \ndeterminants, of 150 S. marcescens  strains  associated with dif -\nferents infections from 14 hospitals across Argentina isolated from \n1997 to 2018.\nThe 150 strains were sequenced by Miseq. The sequences were \nassembled with SPAdes 3.9.0. The genomes were annotated with \nProdigal and used the RefSeq database for the genome annotation \nwhich was completed with specific analysis by using Blast. The plas -\nmids were identified with PlasmidFinder. Antimicrobial resistance \ngenes were identified using RESfinder, CARD and Blastn.\nOne important feature of pathogens belonging to this genus is their \nintrinsic and acquired resistance to a wide variety of antibiotic fam -\nilies, including \u03b2-lactam, aminoglycosides, quinolones and amino -\nglycosides. Our results showed that clinical isolates carried a great \ndiversity of plasmids including  identical plasmids circulating in two \ndifferent hospitals carrying blaKPC-2 . The gene blaCTX-M-2  was found \ninserted into both the plasmid and the chromosome associated with \ndifferents complex integrons. The blaCTX-M-8 and blaCTX-M-15 genes \nwere also found to be associated with these platforms.\nOn the other hand, in this study, the most frequently occurring ami -\nnoglycoside-modifying enzymes included AAC(6\u2019)-I, AAC(3)-I and \nANT(3\u2019\u2019)-I. Also, unusual combinations were also found such as \nAAC((6\u2019)-Ie/APH(2\u2019\u2019) in one of the isolates. \nFrom the molecular point of view, the genomic plasticity of S. mar -\ncescens allowed us to presume that it is a reservoir of antibiotic \nresistance genes.\n11.

First, we isolated and characterized the OMVs from \nE. coli _mcr-1 that has a plasmid, harboring the mcr-1 - genes.  The vesicles treated with DNAase were studied and characterized by mi -\ncroBCA, NTA, and TEM. NTA results showed a major peak between \n100\u2013200 nm in diameter .These results were confirmed through TEM \nimages. Second, the DNA was purified from the OMVs and used for \nPCR analysis. Third, these OMVs were used to transform multidrug \nresistant clinical strain E. coli  SM5 belonging to pandemic clones \nST131 which harbors pDCAG1 plasmid with the extended-spectrum \nbeta-lactamase blaCTXM-15 gene. The checking of the transfer was per -\nformed by colony PCR for the mcr-1  gene of different colonies that \ngrew in plates with 50ug/ml of colistin. Further, gene maintenance \nexperiment was conducted at increasing concentrations of colistin. \nIn the present study for the first time, we characterized OMVs har -\nbouring the mcr-1  gene from E. coli _mcr-1 clinical strain. In addition, \nthe transfer and maintenance of colistin resistance through OMVs to \npandemic clone E. coli  ST 131 demonstrates the threat of this still \nnot completely studied mechanism of the Lateral Genetic Transfer.\n12.

Previous results from our group have shown that a functional \nlink exists between ES and bone marrow (BM)-derived stem cells . \nIn spite of its characterized molecular pathology, many ES develop -\nment mechanistic aspects remain unknown, without  a well-defined \netiology, and there is a need to elucidate mechanisms associated \nto tumor cell survival and cancer progression. Further, markers \nassociated to clinical progression need to be identified. Given that \nmesenchymal stem cells (MSC) play a central role in regulating os -\nteogenesis and hematopoiesis, sharing functional and hierarchical \nrelationship to ES, we undertook a proteomic analysis with a shot -\ngun approach aimed at comparing BM-MSC and TC71 ES cells. We \nidentified 565 proteins shared by BM-MSC and TC71 cells, while \nTC71 had 628 and BM-MSC 484 unique proteins. Gene ontology \nanalysis revealed that major differences were found in metabolism \npathways, with emphasis in the citric acid cycle, electron transport \nand ATP synthesis that may relate to the aggressiveness of the dis -\nease in terms of rapid growth and metastases development after \ndiagnosis. We also found differences related to protein cellular dis -\ntribution, with a higher percentage of mitochondrial proteins in ES \ncells (43,71% TC71 vs 27,86% BM-MSCs), pointing that metabolism \ngoverns major divergences in ES cells. In terms of the ES signature \nEWS-FLl1 translocation that leads to cluster ES tumors as rather \nhomogeneous, further exploration on the transcriptional activity of \nthis oncoprotein in relation to the elusive cell of origin, will lead to \nimprove the management of this sarcoma in soft tissues other than \nbone, as well as to identify markers associated to progression and \ntherapy response.  \n13.

Qual -\nity control (QC) of reads was carried out with FastQC and Kraken, \nthe novo  assembly with SPAdes, assemblies\u00b4 QC with QUAST and \nannotated with Prokka. ARIBA with different databases was used for \nthe analysis of antimicrobial resistance determinants, plasmids, and \nMLST. Snippy was used to determine single nucleotide polymor -\nphisms (SNPs) and INDELs against S. aureus  MW2 and SA454He \nas reference sequences. \nAll strains belong to ST1, harbour mecA  on SCC mecV and carry \nan average of 1576 SNPs each when compared to MW2. The blaZ \noperon was detected in SA454He , in a rep5a plasmid of approxi -\nmately 22 kb, with a truncated blaR1 gene. This operon was absent \nin SA454Ho and SA454RIF genomes. SA454RIF and SA454Ho \nonly carried one SNP each in rpoB , when compared with SA454He \n(Ser486Leu and Ala576Val, respectively). \nBoth the loss of blaZ operon and rpoB mutations might be related to \nthe hoMRSA phenotype in mutant strains, which could possibly be \nselected in clinical settings.

Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. \nAIMS: To optimize several conditions for novel, complementary \nbiochemical assays allowing the screening of proteome differenc -\nes between cell treatments by using cell-free, in vitro radiolabeling \nassays outperforming Coomassie and silver staining in sensitivity. \nMETHODS: As model, macrophages were cultured and stimulated/\ninfected or not with different treatments, bacteria, lipopeptides and \ntimes. Sub-fractionated cytosols were incubated in parallel with dif -\nferent radiolabeled nucleotides and a large battery of combinatorial \nreaction components, additives and conditions. Cell-free reactions \nwere separated in 1D and 2D gels comparing proteome profiles by \nstaining versus radiolabeling, analyzing effects of reaction compo -\nnents and culture conditions. The sample size was 3-6 and 4-9 for \neach reaction and culture condition, respectively. After systematic \niteration, we selected the reactions detecting infection time-depen -\ndent proteome differences with 90-100 % reproducibility and >20 \n% dysregulated level. RESULTS: The assays were versatile, robust \nand suited for cytosols, detecting different complementary proteome \nprofiles depending on the in vitro labelling covalent linkage (phos -\nphorylation, nucleotidylylation, ribosylation, AMPylation). Nucleo -\ntides labeled in g or a phosphate worked differently. In vivo phos -\nphorylations were evidenced by coupled phosphatase assays (in \nvivo sites were excluded from reactions unless dephosphorylated). \nIntentionally phosphorylating non-physiologic sites unoccupied in \ncells some proteins were labeled reproducibly, regardless of culture \nconditions, sensitively quantitating their expression level. Proteome \nradiolabeling outperformed staining in sensitivity for low-abundance \nproteins uncovering 5 novel, reproducibly altered proteins with \ntime-dependent up-/down-regulation. CONCLUSION: the assays \nuncovered new markers and pathways of innate immune respons -es, one having a novel PTM and possible uses in vaccine/adjuvant \ntesting and infectology.\n15.

In the present study we aim to describe the gut \nmicrobiota of patients with UC in comparison with non-UC controls. \nWe evaluated 46 individuals, 26 non-UC controls and 20 UC pa -\ntients, from the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires (BA), Argentina. \nThe hypervariable regions V3-V4 of the bacterial 16SR gene were \nsequenced using a MiSeq platform and sequences were analyzed \nusing the QIIME2 environment. In addition, we looked for differential \nfunctional pathways using PICRUSt and compared the performance \nof three machine learning models to discriminate the studied indi -\nviduals, using taxa and functional annotations. We found no signif -\nicant differences in gut microbiota richness or evenness between \nUC patients and non-UC controls (alpha diversity). Remarcably, \nbeta diversity showed significant differences. At the phylum level, \nVerrucomicrobia  was overrepresented in controls while Actinobac -\nteria was distinctive of UC patients;  At the genus level Bacteroides  \nand Akkermancia  were significantly more abundant among controls \nwhile Eubacterium  and Collinsella  in UC patients. In addition, our \nresults showed that carbohydrates metabolism was preponderant in \nUC patients, not observing a distinctive biochemical pathway for the \nhealthy non-UC controls. Finally, in order to define a robust classi -\nfying method in our population, we evaluated the capability of three \nmachine learning random forest models to classify individuals. Our \nresults reinforced the idea of functional compensation in microbiome \ncommunities, as models that used KEGG orthologs annotations had \nbetter capabilities than taxonomy to distinguish UC patients. Our \nstudy provides new knowledge on the differences and similarities of \nthe gut microbiota of UC patients as compared to non-UC controls \nof our population. \n16.

Pseudomonas punaustralis  Ca10SN1 is a recently dis -\ncovered bacterium that carries a sedentary integron. In this work, \nwe studied the distribution, structure, and recombinogenic charac -\nteristics of the attC sites of P. punaustralis Ca10SN1 to discuss the MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

For this, the P. punaus -\ntralis  Ca10SN1 genome was sequenced, assembled and annotated. \nIntegron related regions and their components were predicted using \nIntegron finder . The dissemination of the P. punaustralis  Ca10SN1 \nattC sites was assessed using MegaBLAST, counting the number of \nspecies whose hit was \u226597% of identity and coverage. The number \nof mutations in the R and L boxes of the attC sites was estimated \nby comparing them with the attC site associated with the integrase \n(IntIPpun). Secondary structures were obtained using the RNAfold \nprogram of the Vienna RNA 2 package. Moreover, the probability of \nattC sites of folding a recombinogenic structure (pfold) was calcu -\nlated with previously published equations. One integron integrase \nwas predicted (IntIPpun), and 26 attC sites were identified, being \none attC site associated with IntIPpun, and 25 attC sites scattered \nthroughout the genome in CALINs. Regarding dissemination, 50% \nof the predicted attC sites were unique of P. punaustralis  Ca10SN1 \ngenome, 38.46% were exclusive to the genus Pseudomonas  and \n7.7% were found outside the genus Pseudomonas . The mean mu -\ntations in the 1L, 2L, 2R, and 1R boxes were 2.16\u00b10.21, 2.2\u00b10.35, \n1.28\u00b10.29, and 1.64\u00b10.21bp, respectively. 2L and 2R showed signif -\nicant differences (P<0.1) through a two-way ANOVA test. The pfold \nrange of the attC sites was between 9.84x10-1-6.45x10-31. Our re -\nsults suggest that could be a threshold of mutations that may restrict \nthe activity of IntIPpun on attC sites, evolutionarily constraining their \ndispersal to other species and genera.\n17.

Detection of PCD or its features is far from an impossible \ntask, though it often requires some degree of experience and surely \nconsumable reagents. In the present work, we aimed to develop a \nsimple and fast way to accurately detect PCD on transmitted light \nmicroscopy (TLM) images from cell cultures using convolutional \nneural networks (CNN). We trained our network to detect PCD on \nfour cancer cell lines and three pluripotent stem cell lines treated \neither with a topoisomerase I inhibitor -camptothecin (CPT)- or \nDMSO (vehicle) for 1, 2 and 3h. TLM images were taken immediate -\nly before adding the treatments (untreated) and every hour. PCD in \nevery cell line was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (Annexin -\nV+/7-AAD-) and immunostaining of \u03b3H2AX and p53. Classification \nwas initially performed labelling both cell line and condition, reaching \na final accuracy of 98.8 % in the validation set, and 98.7% in the test \nset at 1h of treatment with CPT. Comparing all non-exposed cells \nversus all exposed cells images showed an even higher accuracy \nof classification (99.4%). Finally, we ran an analysis treating each \ngroup independently, again classification was in general excellent. \nConsidering the minor morphological changes at 1h, we challenged \n5 experienced researchers (who had never seen the images before) \nto correctly classify CPT exposure in a random set of 50 images \n(pre-training). We then allowed them to train by looking at 500 la -\nbeled images and classify another set of 50 images (post-training). \nPerformance by investigators was completely random, both before \nand after training, indicating that features detected by CNN are not \neasily recognizable. In conclusion, CNNs are able to detect subtle \nmorphological changes consistent with PCD. Furthermore, we set \nup a script to easily train a CNN for such assays.\n18.

CRISPR technology has generated great expectation \nin the field of gene editing. Since March 2020, Stanford\u2019s laboratory \nhas become a world referent by offering an antiviral therapy. Up to \ndate COVID-19 continues spreading relentless worldwide, mainly \nover winter time of the southern hemisphere. During this time, the \nvirus has undergone mutations with uncertain impact on the efficacy \nof the crRNAs originally designed by Abbott. Our aim is to analyze \nthe performance of Stanford\u2019s crRNAs in 905 SARS-COV-2 South \nAmerican Genomic Sequences (SAGS).\nMethodology . The top 40 crRNAs targeting the conserved RdRP \nand N regions of SARS-COV-2 RefSeq selected by Abbott were \nused for alignment studies with the SAGS published until September \n2020 in GISAID. The bioinformatics tools Bowtie, MAFFT, Jalview \nand Cas13design were used for aligning and analyzing crRNAs to \nSAGS with a criterion of maximum complementarity (-v 0) and fast \nprogressing method (FFT-NS-2). \nResults . The clade distribution analysis of the SAGS revealed the \nmain contribution of GR (53%), G (24%), GH (15%) in accordance \nto GISAD. The alignment of crRNAs to SAGS resulted in 4 out of \n40 crRNA (10%) presenting an alignment efficiency lower than the \n99% cutoff. These 4 crRNAs originated 269 misalignments mainly \non sequences from Brazil (74%), Peru (10%) and Chile (8%). Mis -\naligned Brazilian sequences had a distinctive mutation (T29148C). \nThe Cas13design analysis predicted a high efficacy score for 2 of \nthe 4 crRNAs (Q4-Q3) and low for the remaining 2 (Q2-Q1).\nConclusion . The evolution of the SARS-COV-2 clades in South \nAmerica diverged from the scenario predicted in January 2020 in the \nNorthern Hemisphere. However, the projected impact represents \nonly a 1% loss of efficacy, the T29148C mutation circulating in Brazil \nbeing the main cause of misalignment in that country. Therefore, the \ncombination of several crRNAs consolidates as the global antiviral \nCRISPR-based therapeutic strategy.\n19.

Instituto de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas (INBIOMED, UBA, \nCONICET) \nInhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) have been shown to play a central \nrole in the development and aggressiveness of different tumors. In \nparticular, overexpression of BIRC6, a member of the IAP family, \nis associated with a poor prognosis in different tumors. The aim of \nthis work was to select a possible therapeutic target through a tran -\nscriptomic analysis of the IAP family in lung cancer and develop \nbaculovirus-based gene therapy vectors. \nWe focused the transcriptomic analysis on Lung Adenocarcinoma \n(LAC) and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LSCC). Two TCGA da -\ntabases were analyzed for each cancer type and seven IAP were \nqueried (cBioPortal and Xena platform). Our results demonstrated \nthat at least two (BIRC5 and BIRC6) of the seven IAP have a high -\ner expression in tumor compared to normal tissue in both types of \ntumors (ANOVA). Also, our results showed that LAC patients with \nalterations in the birc6  gene copy number have a shorter median \nmonths of each disease status compared to the unaltereted group. \nMoreover, we observed that a higher copy number of birc6  was as -\nsociated with resistance to radiotherapy and tumor recurrence (\u03c7 2).\nIn order to characterize the role of BIRC6  in LAC, we designed three \nshRNAs targeting different regions of the birc6  gene. Using bioinfor -\nmatic methods we evaluated different parameters of the shRNAS  \n(structure, stability, etc). Next, three recombinant baculoviruses (BV) \nwere generated carrying each of these shRNA sequences and the \nreporter gene dTomato . The effect of BV-mediated birc6  silencing \nwas evaluated in the human LAC cell line A549 by immunofluo -\nrescence and flow cytometry. Apoptosis levels were measured by ABSTRACTS51\nTUNEL. One of the recombinant BV effectively reduced BIRC6 ex -\npression and induced apoptosis in 30% of the A549 treated cells ( t \ntest).\nThese results are encouraging and open the way to future preclinical \nstudies, postulating BIRC6 as a promising therapeutic target, and \nthe recombinant BV as a possible gene therapy vector against LAC.\n20.

Moreover, \nthis study could help to detect the responsible molecular pathways \nof the biological IR effects. We performed a meta-analysis of raw \ndata from public microarrays of different IR-exposure conditions: ex \nvivo irradiated human peripheral white blood cells (WBC) of healthy \nindividuals and cancer patients, as well as total body irradiation or \nlocalized radiotherapy patients. The analysis was assessed using R \ncommander and Bioconductor packages. We identified 275 differ -\nentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR<0.05) after IR-exposure en -\nriched in processes associated with the radioinduced-response. We \nfound a cluster of 21 DEGs which have a high potential to be used \nas biodosimeters and we identified 28 DEGS as possible 2 Gy cut-\noff indicators. Next, we detected eight overrepresented transcription \nfactors (TFs) associated with the IR response (TP53, E2F7, NFIA, \nTCF4, HSF1, JAZF1, KDM4B and SMPX). These results were vali -\ndated by qRT-PCR in ex vivo  irradiated WBC. The expression levels \nof DRAM1, NUDT15, PCNA, PLK2 and TIGAR were confirmed at \n1-4 Gy. Particularly, PCNA increased dose dependently. Curiously, \nTCF4, detected as a new TF implicated in the IR effects, significantly \ndecreased post-irradiation. \nThis pipeline was implemented in cancer patients. We identified six \nDEGs which radiomodulation differs between radiosensitive and \nnon-radiosensitive patients. Among these, two TFs: AFF3 and ATF3 \nand NOLC1 which has not yet been linked to the IR-response. Fi -\nnally, we put together these results to identify a conservative gene \nprofile. We found 32 genes modulated in ex vivo  and in vivo  scen -\neries. In conclusion, herein, we found new potential biomarkers of \nexposure and susceptibility which could improve the management of \nnuclear accident victims and radiotherapy patients.\n21.

We aim to study glycoimmune pathways involved in re -\nsistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies for mela -\nnoma to establish a signature for patient classification. \nMaterials & Methods. Analysis were run using R software v3.6. De -\nconvolution was performed using MIXTURE tool and the glycoim -\nmune pathways analysis was based on GlycoV4 chip (834 genes). \nSignature score was calculated as the geometric mean of the ex -\npression of genes in each signature. Cluster1 and Cluster2 compar -\nisons was performed using Wilcoxon test.\nResults. Metastatic tumor biopsies (n=357) were clustered using 78 \nhigh-variable glycogenes resulting in a Cluster2 of low Overall Sur -\nvival (OS), and a Cluster1 of high OS (p<0.05). Next, we character -\nized the tumor microenvironment (TME) using deconvolution tools. \nCluster2 showed a lower absolute score (p<0.001) and proportion \nof cell types associated with immune activation (activated CD8+, \nCD4+ and M1 macrophages), while showing higher proportion of M2 \nmacrophages and resting CD4+ cells. Cluster2 also showed low -\ner Cytolytic Score, lower TMB and higher Intratumor Heterogeneity \n(p<0.01). When analyzing gene signatures, Cluster2 showed lower \nscore of apoptosis and interferon- g with higher score of proliferation \n(p<0.01). We built a predictive model based on a Bayes Na\u00efve clas -\nsifier (AUC=0.902) using 20 features identified by recursive feature \nelimination and used it to classify 73 baseline biopsies of a sepa -\nrate cohort (anti-PD1, n=41; Combo, n=32). Patients classified as \nCluster2 consistently had lower OS (p<0.01). By performing a Fish -\ner\u2019s test, we found a significant association between Cluster2 and \nnon-responding patients (p<0.05).\nConclusion. Dysregulation of 78 glycogenes correlates with distinct \nprofiles of TME and biomarkers in association with OS. These pro -\nfiles were also found in a cohort of ICB-treated patients. Further \nanalysis is required to validate these findings in order to unveil new \nmechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy.\n24.

Through cBioportal software we found that \n5.3% of the patients with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes \n(n=13/292) had developed BrCa previously. Then we analyzed miR -\nNAs expression in breast primary tumors (BPT) or normal adjacent \ntissue (NAT) from patients obtained from the TCGA Breast Can -\ncer cohort using UCSC Xena resource (n=1,229). Among the five \nmiRNAs overexpressed in AML, only miR-29b was differentially ex -\npressed in BPT vs. NAT (p<0.001). Using DIANA-TarBase tool, we \nfound that hematologic neoplasms, which include AML, were highly \nrelated to miR-29b, and TET1 was one of the most targeted genes \n(prediction score=0.98), validated in BM. KEGG analysis using DI -\nANA-miRPath showed that miR-29b is involved in several types of \ncancer including chronic leukemia and AML. Gene ontology analysis \nrevealed that extracellular matrix processes and DNA demethyla -\ntion were significantly regulated by miR-29b (p<0.01). MiR-29b was \nfound in exosomes from BrCa, using EVmiRNA software. \nIn summary, our results suggest that AML might emerge as a sec -\nondary neoplasm induced by BrCa through circulating miR-29b, \nwhich targets TET gene.\n25.

Yale University, School of Medicine, Department of Internal \nMedicine, New Heaven, United States.\nLiver X Receptors (LXRs) are ligand-activated transcription fac -\ntors of the nuclear receptor superfamily, being the oxysterols their \nendogenous ligands. They play a key role in maintaining the lipid \nhomeostasis by inducing the expression of genes involved in cho -\nlesterol transport and the de novo  synthesis of triacylglycerides, \nas well as regulating immune and inflammatory responses. In the \nmammary gland, these processes are tightly regulated postnatally. \nDuring lactation, the gland is endowed with an enormous capacity to \nsynthesize and secrete lipids, however, after weaning, it undergoes \na rapid involution in which inflammatory cytokines play a major role. \nWe have previously shown that LXR\u03b1 is expressed in the lactating \nmurine mammary epithelium and is an important regulator of choles -\nterol incorporation into the milk (Grinman et. al., 2019), however, lit -\ntle is known about its role in other stages of this organ development. \nBased on an integrative analysis of public data from previous reports \nwhich use technologies such as bulk and scRNA-seq, ChIP-seq and \nATAC-seq, we aimed to study at the single cell level, the role of \nthe LXRs in the mammary gland development. We hypothesized \nthat the LXRs pathway is upregulated from pregnancy to lactation \nand further downregulated towards involution. Using genes found \nto be regulated upon LXRs activation by Boergesen et. al., 2012, \nwe tested if such LXR signature was enriched in the transitions be -\ntween cell clusters of the scRNA-seq data from Bach et. al., 2017. \nPreliminary results from our analysis show a significant increase in \nthe expression of the lipogenic Srebf1, Thrsp, Fasn  and Me1 genes ABSTRACTS53\nin mammary epithelial luminal progenitors in the transition from of \nvirgin mice to lactation, and a concomitant decrease of the same \ngenes from lactation to post-involution. These results support the \nrole of the LXR as an important modulator of the lipid homeosta -\nsis in the lactating gland, modulating milk requirements to feed the \nnewborn. \nCARDIOVASCULAR Y RESPIRATORIO\n26.

Although novel studies have suggested \nthat T3 enhances the activation of AMPK, a key enzyme regulator of \nenergy balance, its role has not been elucidated yet.\nIn the present study the role of AMPK in the effects exerted by acute \ntreatment with T3 on ischemic-reperfused myocardium was investi -\ngated. For this aim, rat left atria were subjected to 75 min simulated \nischemia (I)-75 min reperfusion (R), in the presence of T3 (60 nM) \nand AMPK inhibitor, Compound C (CC; 10 \u03bcM). ANOVA, followed by \nTukey, n=8/group.\nResults showed that CC prevented the increase of AMPK acti -\nvation induced by T3 (End stabilization period (ESP):1.33\u00b10.02, \nI-R:2.20\u00b10.11*, I-R+T3:2.79\u00b10.10*#, I-R+T3+CC:1.17\u00b10.10 \nAU;*p<0.05 vs ESP, I-R+T3+CC; #p<0,05 vs I-R).

Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n, Concepci\u00f3n, Chile\nSpecific interactions of apolipoproteins with components of the ex -tracellular matrix (ECM), as proteoglycans (PGs), are associated \nwith amyloidosis or atherosclerosis. These interactions seem to \ndepend on age, cellular differentiation, and pathological conditions, \nwhich might modify glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) composition.\nWe previously showed that apoA-I Arg173Pro (a natural mutant \ninvolved in cardiac amyloidosis) but not the wild type protein (Wt) \nbound heparin at pH 7.4 This indicates that selective interactions of \nthis variant may occur with GAGs. To study the specific role of the \nmatrix?s charge on the interaction of apoA-I with GAGs, we synthe -\nsized polymers having different ratios of sulfated (sodium 4-styrene \nsulfonate, (SSNa) or hydroxilated monomers (2-hydroxyethyl meth -\nacrylate, (HEMA)) and studied the binding of fluorescently labelled \napoA-I Wt or Arg173Pro. We show that both proteins are highly re -\ntained as long as the negative charge increases (50% with p \u22640.05 \nas negative charge of the SSNa increased from 0.25 to 0.75 M). In \naddition , Arg173Pro remained in the matrix 10 % more than Wt (p \n< 0.01), indicating that the retention of specific proteins in the ECM \ncould be part of the pathogenicity. To analyze the differential inter -\naction with GAGs, Wt or Arg173Pro were incubated in the presence \nof Dermatan Sulfate (DS) or sodium heparin (HEP). The samples \n(n=4), were centrifuged, and pellets and supernatants analyzed by \npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. GAGs were visualized by stain -\ning with toluidine blue and the proteins with Silver stain. We ob -\nserved that Arg173Pro had more interaction with DS and HEP than \nthe Wt variant, which is interesting, since both GAGs are associated \nwith amyloid deposits and heart disease, respectively. We conclude \nthat the interactions of apoA-I variants with GAGs offer a challenging \nfield to understand, not only the pathology but also possible thera -\npeutic strategies to treat this disease.\n28.

However, multiple and com -\nplex events might contribute to the breakdown of this protein to fulfill \nits protective role. To set light on this topic, we took advantage of the \nstudy of a natural variant with a deletion of the lysine 107 (K107del) \nassociated with atherosclerosis and amyloidosis. We oxidized the \nvariants by controlled incubation with H2O2  and determined struc -\ntural and biological parameters by biophysical and biological ap -\nproaches.\nBoth variants oxidized under these conditions preserved or even \ninduced an increase in the lipid clearance with respect to untreat -\ned proteins (20 % with p \u2264 0.05), and decreased the yield of the \nphysiological dimeric conformations. Following 30-day incubation at \n37oC K107del  but not Wt acquired a well-defined fibrillar conforma -\ntion which is the main signature of the amyloid pathology. These \nconformations  (but not freshly folded proteins) activated neutrophils \ninto the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (p<0.05) , \nwhich was drastically elicited in the case of the K107del ( p<0.001).\nTo initiate the search of possible pathways involved in cellular acti -\nvation, we tested a cellular model of macrophages. Fresh and ox -\nidized Wt promoted the increase of p62 (p \u2264 0.005), a protein de -\nscribed as anti-inflammatory. In the presence of ATRA (an inhibitor \nof Nrf2-Keap pathway), only Wt effect was blocked (by 40%). Thus, \nit may be suggested that the oxidation of apoA-I resulted in the loss \nof one of its key functions. Altogether, our data support that post \ntranslational apoA-I modifications (probably chronic and progres -\nsive) raised a protein conformation with significant loss of function \nand increased aggregation tendency.

Taquini de Investigaciones en Medicina Traslacional (IA -\nTIMET)\nIntroduction : Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is one of the main car -\ndiovascular risk factors and leads to heart contractile and energy \ndysfunction. I/R-induced damage is reduced by ischemic postcon -\nditioning. CoCl \u2082 has properties to function as a postconditioning \nagent, since it can trigger transcriptional changes that resemble the \nresponse to a hypoxic event under normoxic conditions.\nObjectives : To evaluate CoCl \u2082 as a postconditioning therapeutic \ntool after a myocardial and arterial I/R.\nMaterials and Methods : Isolated adult Wistar rats hearts were ar-\nterially perfused at 37\u00baC by Langendorff method, paced at 3 Hz, \nexposed to 30 min ischemia followed by 45 min reperfusion (R) in \nthe presence or absence of 0.23 mM CoCl2 which was maintained \nor removed after 20 min of R.\nAortic contractility was evaluated in an isolated organ bath trough in -\ncubation with cumulative noradrenaline (NA) doses. After NA wash -\ning, 20 min of simulated arterial ischemia (SI) and R with or without \nCoCl\u2082 was performed, and NA response was re-evaluated.\nResults : During R, the presence of CoCl \u2082 did not alter the cardiac \nresting pressure, nor the perfusion pressure, but increased the de -\nveloped pressure (p<0.05) until 20 min which then descend reach -\ning controls values. This decrease was prevented when CoCl \u2082 was \neliminated at 20 min of R. CoCl \u2082 in R increased the contractile econ -\nomy (P/Ht) and decreased the cardiac damaged area (p<0.05) and \nthe incidence of arrhythmias (p<0.001).\nPost-SI arterial contractility increased at the lowest NA dose but not \nat higher ones. CoCl \u2082 in post \u2013SI R did not affect arterial force, but \ndecreased NA sensitivity (EC 50: control: 10-7.5, CoCl2: 10-6.5 M) and \nthe maximum contractile response.\nConclusion : The use of CoCl \u2082 after an ischemic event attenuates \nthe cardiac damage produced at least during the first 25 min of R \nand reduces the arterial adrenergic contractile response. These re -\nsults support the use of CoCl \u2082 as a potential cardioprotective tool of \nclinical relevance.\n30.

Margni (IDEHU, \nUBA-CONICET)\nAIM: To study the changes of mitochondrial production rates and/or \nsteady-state concentrations ([X]ss) of O2-, H2O2, NO and ONOO- in \nthe temporal evolution of cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in a type \n1 diabetes model.  METHODS:  Diabetes was induced by a single \ndose of Streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg, ip) in male rats. Glycemia \n(mg/dl) was determined after 72 h (C:130 \u00b1 5; DM:415 \u00b1 23). The \nanimals were sacrificed after 10 or 28 days of STZ-injection (7 or \n25 days of hyperglycemia). Mn-SOD activity, and H2O2 and NO pro -\nduction rates were determined in the cardiac mitochondrial fraction. \n[O2-]ss,[NO]ss and ONOO- generation were estimated from exper -\nimental data. RESULTS: When animals were sacrificed 10 days \nafter STZ-injection, heart mitochondrial NO (30%) and H2O2 (117%) \nproductions were higher and Mn-SOD activity was lower (15%) than \ncontrol values. Moreover, mitochondrial [O2-]ss was 2.5-fold higher in \nheart from diabetic rats, along with a 30% increase in [NO]ss. Thus, \nONOO- production rate resulted 3 times higher. When animals were subjected to 25 days of hyperglycemia, Mn-SOD activity was really \nreduced (50%). While H2O2 generation was extremely augmented \n(128%), the increase in NO generation (23%) was similar to the one \nobserved at 7 days. Increases in [O2-]ss (350%), [NO]ss (25%), and \nONOO- production (450%) were obtained. Moreover, nitration of ty -\nrosine residues of mitochondrial proteins was observed in diabetic \nanimals sacrificed at day 28. CONCLUSIONS: Heart mitochondrial \nproduction rates of H2O2, NO and ONOO- were higher in diabetic \nthan in control animals, both after 7 and 25 days of hyperglycemia. \nNo difference in the increase -over the control values- of [NO]ss was \nobserved over time, while a much greater rise in [O2-]ss was detected \nafter 25 days of sustained hyperglycemia respect to the enhance -\nment obtained at 7 days, intensifying the difference in ONOO- gen-\neration. Therefore, ONOO- generation rate is mainly controlled by \n[O2-]ss rather than by [NO]ss\n31.

Its use in patients with CoViD-19 and hypoxemia in China \nshowed promising results although its use was poorly evaluated. \nMethods: A randomized, controlled study was started, comparing \nstandard care (Control Group which includes non-hyperbaric oxy -\ngen supply) versus standard care plus HBOT (Test). The HBOT was \ncarried out with Biobarica chambers of national development and \nmedium pressure (1.45 atm) in sessions of 90 minutes per day for \nat least 5 days. Baseline daily oxygen saturation (SatO2) breathing \nambient air (FiO2 = 0.21%) prior to HBOT was recorded. Results: \n18 patients were included (ratio 1:1). The comparison between the \ngroups did not show significant differences in terms of clinical status, \ngeneral compromise, laboratory, age, comorbidities or history. The \nevolution of the HBOT group showed a rapid increase in SatO2 with \na significant difference between groups from day 4 onwards. On day \n5, the HBOT group presented SatO2 94.4 \u00b1 2.7 (91.0-98.0)% Vs \n89,8\u00b12,3 (87,0-94,0) in control group. The time to normalize oxygen \nSaturation was significantly shorter in the HBOT group [mean\u00b1SD \n(min-max)]: 3,3\u00b11,4 (1,0-5,0) VS 5,8\u00b11,4 (3,0-7,0) days (P=0,002). \nThe ascending slope for SatO2 in HBOT group was significantly \nhigher than the control group: 2,1\u00b10,6 (1,3-3,2) VS 1,5\u00b10,6 (0,8-2,8) \n%/day (P 0,04).

Institute of biomedical research in retroviruses and AIDS\nIntroduction : It is known that remote ischemic preconditioning \n(rIPC) reduces infarct size in experimental models of myocardial \ninfarction (MI); while its effect is controversial in the clinical setting. \nParticularly, the effect of rIPC on post-infarction ventricular remod -\neling is unknown. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of \nrIPC on early ventricular remodeling, considering the myocardial \ninfarction expansion.ABSTRACTS55\nMethods:  Male FVB mice, 2-6 months old, underwent MI by perma -\nnent ligation (for 7 days) of the left anterior coronary artery; In a sec -\nond group, a rIPC protocol (3 cycles of 5 min ischemia/reperfusion \nin the left lower limb) was performed prior to MI. Finally, a third group \nwas undergoing to left thoracotomy, but without myocardial ischemia \n(Sham). Infarct size was measured with triphenyltetrazolium, ven -\ntricular function by hemodynamic and echocardiography, and MMPs \n2 and 9 activity was evaluated by zymography.\nResults : There were no significant differences in the risk area and \ninfarct size between groups. IM decreased ejection fraction and \narea shortening fraction to a value of 55,06\u00b12,6% and 26,76\u00b11,21%; \nrespectively (p\u22640,05 vs sham). rIPC improved systolic function in -\ncreasing ejection fraction and the area shortening fraction to a val -\nue of 67,64%\u00b11,42 and 37,41\u00b12,37%, respectively (p\u22640,05 vs IM). \nWe did not observe significant differences between groups in the \nend-systolic stress values (afterload index). The relationship be -\ntween end-systolic stress and ejection fraction was plotted, observ -\ning a significant improvement in the rIPC group, compared to the MI \ngroup. Finally, rIPC reduced significantly MMP-9 activity in the left \nventricle (infarct area), but not MMP-2.\nConclusion : We have showed that rIPC has a beneficial effect on \nearly remodeling, reducing myocardial post-infarction expansion \nand improving ventricular function. This beneficial effect could be \nrelated to a lower MMP-9 activity.\n33.

Facultad de \nCs.Qu\u00edmicas-UNC. CIBICI-CONICET. \nChagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi , is an \nimportant cause of cardiac disease in endemic areas of Latin Amer -\nica. About 35% of infected patients develop chronic myocardiopathy \nthat can lead to cardiac failure and stroke. The other infected patients \nremain asymptomatic (indetermined form), although increased aorta \nstiffness (AS) has been described in all infected patients suggesting \nthat the infection could contribute to vascular alterations. Despite \nthe importance of the vasculature in regulating the homeostasis of \nthe cardiovascular system, little is known about its changes in re -\nsponse to this infection. The aim of this work was to study vascular \ncell population changes during the acute phase of T. cruzi  infection. \nThoracic (Athor), abdominal aorta (Aabd), aortic arch, and brachio -\ncephalic artery (BCA) were obtained from BALB/c mice infected with \n500 tps of T. cruzi  at day 16 post-infection with non-infected mice \n(NI) used as controls. Arterial segments were analyzed by multi -\nparametric FACS followed by t-SNE analysis to identify different cell \npopulations. Similar cell clusters were observed in BCA, Aabd, and \narch but not in Athor of NI mice. In addition, Athor was the segment \npresenting the major differences in cell clusters composition after \ninfection. Thus, T. cruzi  infection increased the percent of \u03b1-SMA+ \n(smooth muscle cells, SMC) and F4/80+ CD11b+ (macrophages, \nMo) cells, and the expression of markers of active immune cells. \nInterestingly, cell clusters co-expressing SMC- and Mo-markers, \nsuggesting SMC-transdifferentiation into Mo or viceversa, were also \nobserved in Athor. Taken together, these results suggest that T. cruzi  \ninfection induces vascular changes, being Athor the most affected \nsegment. Besides, transdifferentiation and immune cell activation \ncould be mechanisms involved in these vascular alterations.\n35.

The aim of this study was to investi -\ngate molecular mechanisms involved in SMC differentiation medi -\nated by novel lncRNAs. We used an in vitro  model of cell-to-cell \ncontact-induced SMC differentiation of pulmonary artery-derived \nSMC (hPASMC, Lonza). LncRNAs expression was assessed by \nIllumina RNA deep-sequencing of total RNA and RT-qPCR. The MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

LncRNA4 pull-down showed its as -\nsociation with the methylation machinery. Interestingly, the levels \nof the m6A reader YTHDF2 decreased throughout differentiation \n(p=0,0031). YTHDF2 silencing using siPool-RNAs induced a signif -\nicant increase of the candidate lncRNA4 ( p<0,0001), as well as of \nMYOCD (p=0,0008) and CNN1  (p=0,0136) evaluated by RT-qPCR \nindicating an induction of SMC differentiation. These findings sup -\nport that lncRNA4 and YTHDF2 are key to SMC differentiation and \ntherefore could have a role in the development of cardiovascular \ndiseases.\n36.

In pre -\nvious studies, we demonstrated that the oral administration of S im -\nproved the recovery of hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (I-\nR), and increased phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3\u03b2. These effects \nwere partially reverted by the administration of wortmannin (W), an \nupstream inhibitor of Akt.\nSince mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in IR injury, we \naimed to investigate the effects of oral administration of S (168mg/\nkg/15days) on several mitochondrial parameters from Langen -\ndorff-perfused rat hearts subjected to I-R.\nHearts from female Wistar rats (200-250g) fed ad libitum were used. \nW (100nM) was added 15 minutes before I. The mitochondrial ultra -\nstructure was analyzed by electron microscopy, the measurement of \nmitochondrial ATP synthesis was performed by the luciferin-lucifer -\nase method and calcium-triggered mitochondrial swelling was deter -\nmined as % of light scattering decrease at 540nm (%LSD). We also \nstudied calcium retention capacity (CRC) by exposing mitochondria \nto small pulses of calcium using the fluorescent dye: Calcium Green-\n5N. ANOVA, n=8/group.\nResults showed, at the end of reperfusion, an increase in mito -\nchondrial ATP synthesis rate of hearts treated with S (C:66.3\u00b16.5, \nW:59.5\u00b16.1, S:87.3\u00b13.7*, S+W:64.6\u00b16.9 nmol/min/mg of mitochon -\ndrial protein; *p<0.05 vs all groups). Likewise, electron micrographs \nshowed better mitochondrial conservation in the S group. In addi -\ntion, both %LSD produced by calcium overload (300\u00b5M) and CRC \nwere significantly lower with S treatment compared to the other \ngroups. (%LSD: C:2.6\u00b10.3, W:2.5\u00b10.4, S:1.3\u00b10.3*, S+W:2.2\u00b10.3%; \nCRC: C:31.0\u00b13.1, W:30.7\u00b13.7, S:46.6\u00b15.4*, S+W:36.8\u00b15.4 nmol \ncalcium/mg protein; *p<0.05 vs all groups).\nThese findings suggest that oral administration of S presents cardio -\nprotective effects due to better mitochondrial preservation and could \nbe partly mediated by Akt activation.\n37.

Increased ex -\npression of the pro-oxidant enzyme NADPH oxidase (NOX) in the \narterial wall has been hypothesized to correlate with vascular inju -\nry and progression of atheroma plaque. Since the gene encoding \nNOX5 is not expressed in the mouse genome, we examined the \nexpression of NOX5 isoform in human endothelial cells (HUVECs) \nunder pro-atherogenic and pro-inflammatory conditions. HUVECs \nwere exposed to Angiotensin II (AngII) or to tumor necrosis factor \n(TNF-alpha) and incubated with selective NOX-inhibitors one hour \nprior treatment. NOX expression was determined by qRT-PCR and \noxidative stress was evaluated  using a fluorescent probe sensitive \nto ROS production. HUVECs expressed both NOX2 and NOX5 \nmRNA (2.4 \u0394CT \u00b10.1 and 19.5 \u0394CT \u00b11.8, respectively). AngII and \nTNF-alfa increased ROS generation in HUVECs which was inhibited \nby selective inactivation of NOX2 or NOX5. As enhanced activity \nof NOXs occur in many pathological conditions including hyperten -\nsion and heart failure we next determined the expression of NOX in \nHuman Mammary Arteries (HMA) of patients undergoing coronary \nbypass surgery. NOX2 and NOX5 expression in HMA were similar \n(7.42 \u0394CT \u00b1 0.55; and 8.32 \u0394CT \u00b1 0.43, respectively), and they \nexhibited a positive and significant correlation (r= 0.665; p=0.0007) \nbetween them. High NOX5 expression was found in patients with \nHypertension, Dyslipidemia and Obesity. Our results suggest that \nNOX2 and NOX5 are up-regulated in pro-atherogenic conditions \nand contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Taking these results into \naccount, it is attractive to speculate that small, selective and specific \ninhibitory molecules of different NOXs could exert a beneficial effect \non vascular pathology\n38.

We aimed to study \nthe cardiovascular effects of genetic deletion of Galectin 3 (Gal3), \na \u03b2-galactosidase binding lectin with proinflammatory and profibrot -\nic effects, in aged mice. Wild type C57BL/6 (C57; n=54) and Gal3 \nknockout (Gal3KO; n=55) mice with access to water and food ad \nlibitum were observed for 24 months . At 2 years of follow up, survival \nrate was quantified, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured \nby plethysmography, and echocardiography (ECO) was performed \nin sedated mice to measure left ventricular geometry and function. \nIn addition, shortening fraction (SF, %) and cardiac mass (m g) were \ncalculated. Then, animals were euthanized, the organs harvested \nweighted and the tibia length (TL) measured. Results (Mean \u00b1 SE): \nAt 2 years, the survival was reduced in Gal3KO (p= 0.02 Gal3KO \nvs C57). SBP (mmHg) was 112 \u00b1 3 in C57 vs 114 \u00b1 3 in Gal3KO \n(p=NS). SF (%) was 61 \u00b1 1 C57 vs 60 \u00b1 2 Gal3KO (p=NS). In -\ncreased hypertrophy was observed in Gal3KO,  posterior wall thick -\nness (mm) was: 0.8 \u00b1 0.02 in C57 vs 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 in Gal3KO (p=0.0003) \nand 1 \u00b1 0.02 in C57 vs 2 \u00b1 0.1 in Gal3KO (p=0.0003) as measured in \ndiastole and systole respectively, while anterior wall thickness (mm) ABSTRACTS57\nin systole was 1 \u00b1 0.02 in C57 vs 2 \u00b1 0.1 in Gal3KO (p=0.0005). Car -\ndiac mass (mg) was 80 \u00b1 10 vs 140 \u00b1 20 in C57 and Gal3KO mice \nrespectively (p=0.01). Left ventricular end systolic and end diastolic \ndiameter (mm) were 1 \u00b1 0.1 in C57 vs 1 \u00b1 0.1 in Gal3KO and 3 \u00b1 0.1 \nin C57 vs 3 \u00b1 0.1 in Gal3KO (p=NS). At necropsy: Heart weight/TL \nand kidney weight/TL were 8 \u00b1 0.3 and 9 \u00b1 0.3 (p<0.05) and 25 \u00b1 1 \nvs 34 \u00b1 1 (p<0.05) in C57 and Gal3KO mice respectively. In summa -\nry, our data suggests that genetic deletion of Gal3 reduced survival \nrate and increased myocardial hypertrophy without changes in SBP \nin aged mice. \nENDOCRINOLOG\u00cdA\n39.

Durand\u201d; 3FCEN-UBA\nCushing disease (CD) is caused by excessive glucocorticoid secre -\ntion due to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) overproduction by \na tumor of the pituitary gland. ACTH biosynthesis is coordinately \ncontrolled by different transcription factors at the level of the pro-opi -\nomelanocortin (Pomc) gene.\nRetinoic acid (RA) is being tested as medical treatment for CD. In \nprevious studies we demonstrated that RA and Bone morphogenetic \nprotein 4 (BMP-4) pathways control Pomc transcription by a poten -\ntiated inhibition.\nIt has been shown that about 25% of patients do not respond to RA \ntreatment. RA inhibitory factors that are expressed in corticotroph \ntumoral cells could allow to predict the response. Among them we \nare exploring COUP-TFI and observed in a first series of patients \nthat one out of four does expresses COUP-TFI, a strong inhibitory \nfactor of RA action.\nIn the search for new factors involved in the effect of RA on Pomc \nand ACTH, that would allow predicting therapeutic efficacy and \npossible secondary events, we studied BMP-4, Nurr77 and octam -\ner-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT-4).\nWe observed a potentiated inhibitory effect of 100nM RA in co-treat -\nment with 100ng/ml BMP-4, on ACTH secretion in murine AtT-20 \ncorticotroph cells, consistent with the potentiated effect described on \nPomc transcription. BMP-4 (3.9-folds) or RA (1.9-folds) treatment in -\ncreased the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5 (Western blot), which was \nnot further altered by the co-treatment (4-folds). Using a luciferase \nreporter for the Pomc promoter, Nur77 enhanced Pomc transcription \nand also RA inhibition, but did not alter the co-treatment. OCT-4 has \na dose dependent inhibitory effect on Pomc transcription, but also \ninduces the loss of action of RA and modulates the BMP-4 action.\nThe regulatory interaction of RA with transcription factors as Smads, \nNur77 or OCT-4 in the control of corticotroph gene expression, \ncould contribute to define more precise biomarkers or targets for \ncorticotrophinomas treatment.\n40.

Takeda Pharmaceutical, Buenos AiresIntroduction: Practice guidelines suggest, but cannot recommend, \nestablishing a diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) with -\nout performing growth hormone stimulation tests (GHST) in children \nwith risk factors, due to the lack of sufficient evidence. Our objective \nwas to develop and validate a prediction rule to diagnose GHD in \nchildren with growth failure and potential risk factors.\nDesign and Methods: Development of a prediction rule, following \nthe TRIPOD methodology, in a cohort of children with growth failure, \nand its validation in a second, independent cohort, in a tertiary pe -\ndiatric hospital.\nResults: In the first cohort (n=770), after tuning the classification \nmodel trained using the 15 potential dichotomic predictors, 9 vari -\nables showed an odds ratio (OR) >5 and a p-value <0.0001. Using \na gain ratio, entropy reducing algorithm to automatically build a de -\ncision tree from the selected variables, without reduce error pruning \nor limits on minimum number of records, the resulting prediction rule \nstated that a patient would have GHD if (s)he had: pituitary dys -\ngenesis, or two or more pituitary deficiencies, or one pituitary defi -\nciency plus: neonatal hypoglycemia or hypogenitalism, or diabetes \ninsipidus, or midline abnormalities, or (supra)sellar tumor/surgery, \nor cranial radiotherapy >18 Gy. In the validation cohort (n=161), t he \nspecificity of the prediction rule was 99.2% (95% CI: 95.6-100%), its \npositive predictive value 95.2% (77.3-99.8%), its positive likelihood \nratio 69.4, and the number needed to test was 1.19.\nConclusions: The clinical rule developed here predicts the exis -\ntence of GHD with high specificity in children with growth disorders \nand clinically identifiable risk factors, thus providing compelling ev -\nidence to strengthen the recommendation that GHD can be safely \ndiagnosed without resorting to GHST in neonates and children with \ngrowth failure and specific comorbidities.\n41.

However, BPH occurs in older men, when androgen levels \nare usually dropped. Accumulated evidence indicates that BPH is \nassociated with a hypoxic microenvironment which contributes to \ncell proliferation. We therefore investigated the effect of hypoxia on \nBPH stromal cell proliferation and the role of testosterone on this \nhypoxic context. Prostatic stromal cells, surgically harvested from \npatients with BPH (n=12 , obtained under informed consent and \napproved by the Comit\u00e9 Institucional de \u00c9tica de Investigaci\u00f3n en \nSalud of Sanatorio Allende), were isolated, cultured, and stimulated \nwith CoCl2 (200 \u00b5M), a stabilizer of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-\n1) that mimics hypoxia, alone or in combination with testosterone at \nphysiological doses (0.1 \u00b5M) for 24h.\nAs expected, CoCl2 induced the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, as deter -\nmined by western blot, which was correlated to a 2-to-4-fold in -\ncrease in cell proliferation (by ki67 and BrdU incorporation) in all \ncultures (p\u02c20.01 vs. vehicle). Testosterone decreased both HIF-\n1\u03b1 expression (p\u02c20.01 vs. CoCl2) and cell proliferation (p\u02c20.01 vs. \nCoCl2) induced by CoCl2 in 8 out 12 patient-derived cell cultures. \nIn the remaining 4 cases, the testosterone treatment resulted in the \nupregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and cell proliferation, which was associated \nwith a low expression of the androgen receptor (AR), by western \nblot, when compared to the previous 8 cell cultures. Then, our aim \nwas to increase the basal levels of AR in those cells by pre-treating \nthem with testosterone for 8h. Afterwards, the cells were subjected \nto hypoxia, with testosterone being able to repress both CoCl2-in-\nduced HIF-1\u03b1 and cell proliferation and thus, changing its behavior.\nOur results indicate that a hypoxic context increases cell prolifera -MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

Buenos Aires, Argentina.\ncorresponding autor: panoevi@yahoo.es \nCushing\u2019s disease (CD) is a common endocrinopathy in dogs. Pul -\nmonary thromboembolism (PT) is one of the alterations with a high \nmortality rate. Pulmonary perfusion centellography is an imaging \nmethod that allows evaluating blood perfusion in the lung and de -\ntecting non-perfused areas, compatible with thrombi. We determined \nthe usefulness of centellography as a method to detect insipient \npulmonary thromboembolism and its association with coagulation \nmarkers. 12 dogs with CD were studied at School Hospital FCV-\nUBA. All presented typicl clinical signs of CD. 4 dogs showed con -\ntinuous panting at rest that was accentuated when walking and in -\ncreased respiratory rate. This panting occurred after the appearance \nof clinical signs of CD(1 to 3 months after). Pulmonary centellogra -\nphy was performed on all of them and D dimer(DD), fibrinogen, ac -\ntivity of antithrombin III(AT-III) and factor VIII(F-VIII) were evaluated \nas a marker for the presence of clots. These values were compared \nbetween the 4 dogs with respiratory problems and the remaining 8 \nanimals. The comparison was made using the Mann-Whitney test, \nconsidering P<0.05 significant. The results were expressed as me -\ndian and minimum and maximum ranges. The 4 dogs with intense \npanting showed a pulmonary lesion (lack of perfusion) compatible \nwith PT on centellography. The 4 dogs with PT presented positive \nDD(>400), lower values of Fibrinogen, AT-III and F-VIII compared \nto the 8 without respiratory distress (P=0.02; P=0.008 and P=0.017 \nrespectively). Pulmonary centellography is a very useful imaging \nmethod to evaluate the perfusion of the lung and detect non-per -\nfused areas compatible with the presence of thrombi. A positive DD \ntogether with a decreased AT-III and F-VIII activity demonstrate a \nstate of hypercoagulability, being useful as markers for the pres -\nence of thrombi. In patients with CD who present intense panting at \nrest and tachypnea, it is recommended to send pulmonary perfusion \ncentellography for early detection of PT.\n43.

The main function of Tissue Kallikrein (KLK1)  is \nthe proteolytic cleavage of kininogen to release kinins: Bradykinin \nand Kallidin, which exert their effect through their receptors B1R and \nB2R. KLK1 was also described as an important activator of latent \nTGF\u03b21,  a potent inhibitor of lactotroph cell proliferation and pro -\nlactin (PRL) secretion. We have previously found that the pituitary \nexpression of KLK1, B1R, B2R, as well as local TGF\u03b21 activity, is \nreduced in prolactinomas. We hypothesize that the recovery of local \nKKS could improve pituitary TGF\u03b21 activity counteracting prolacti -\nnoma development. In the present work, we study the effect of KLK1 \nand the kinins on TGF\u03b21 activation in the pituitary gland. To this end, \n8-month-old female and male mice lacking the dopamine receptor \ntype 2 (Drd2KO) and WT counterparts were used. Only KO female \ndevelops lactotroph hyperplasia and hyperprolactinemia (prolactino -\nma). Pituitary explants from Drd2KO and WT mice were incubated \nwith: KLK1 (1U/ml), the B1R specific agonist (des-Arg-bradykinin, 10-8M) or vehicle for 30 minutes.  ELISAs were performed to as -\nsay active TGF\u03b21 in pituitary homogenates and medium.

Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cni -\ncas (CONICET).\nSeasonal breeding is a common strategy among mammals. Day \nlength (photoperiod) is a determining factor for seasonal reproduc -\ntion. Climate and food availability indicate the optimal time of year \nfor breeding. This is essential in large animals that live several years \nand that are exposed to different climatic conditions. The South \nAmerican plains vizcacha is a rodent with seasonal breeding (twice \na year). It shows a ~154 day-length gestation with reactivation of \nthe reproductive axis at mid-gestation enabling ovarian estradiol \n(E2) and progesterone (P4) synthesis up to term-pregnancy. We \ndeveloped a retrospective study with 1086 adult female vizcachas \ncaptured between years 2006 and 2019 in order to study their repro -\nduction, focusing on ovulation and pregnancy rates, and hormon -\nal dynamics. The effect of environmental conditions was evaluat -\ned. Ovulation and pregnancy rates, and serum E2 and P4 levels \n(measured by ELISA), showed seasonal differences: the gestational \nCycle 1 (from April to August) depicted significant higher rates and \nP4 levels (p<0.05)   than the gestational Cycle 2 (from October to \nFebruary) whereas the latter exhibited significant higher E2 values \n(p<0.05). However, both Cycles exhibited similar hormone profiles \nalong the gestation period with peaks around days 64 and 110. \nDifferences between Cycles were associated with changes in light \navailability. On the other hand, significant variations in hormonal \nvalues were observed among years. High E2 values were signifi -\ncantly associated with high temperatures and low precipitations, \nwhereas low E2 levels were linked to low temperatures and high \nprecipitations. Strikingly, the association of climatic factors with P4 \nlevels was not significant. In conclusion, the reactivation of E2 and \nP4 synthesis at mid-gestation enables delivery at the most favorable \nseasonal condition for breeding. Environmental variables as pho -\ntoperiod, temperature and precipitations would be associated to its \nreproductive strategy.\n45. (176) EFFECT OF STRESS EXPOSURE IN THE PRO -\nGRESSION OF DIABETES. PARTICIPATION OF THE MI -\nCROBIOTA\nRubinstein MR1, Wald MR1, and Genaro AM1\n1. Instituto de investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas (UCA-CONICET)\nType 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by \nimpaired insulin secretion. Recently, there was an increase in T1D \nsuggesting the participation of environmental factors in its develop -\nment. It is well known that the microbiota can modulate the immune \nsystem and multiple studies have shown a decrease in the microbial \ndiversity prior and after the development of the T1D, but the mecha -\nnism involved remains unknown. In addition, it has been recognized \nthe contribution of psychosocial factors in T1D. We have previous -\nly shown that chronic stress worsens the progression of T1D and \nmultiple studies have shown that stress can modify the microbial \ncomposition. The aim of this project is to determine participation of \nthe microbiota and stress on the development and progression of \nT1D and the mechanisms involved. To induced diabetes, we treated \nmale BALB/c mice with multiple low doses of streptozotocin (stz) ABSTRACTS59\nand then, the animals were subject to chronic mild stress (CMS) by \na daily application of different mild stressors. Fecal samples were \ncollected and genomic DNA was extracted. 16s Bacteriodetes and \n16s Firmicultes (most abundant component of the microbiota) were \nmeasured by qPCR using specific primers. We found an increase in \n16s Bacteroidetes after CMS exposure in stz treated mice (DIAB + \nCMS group) compared to all the other treatments (Ctrol, CMS and \nDIAB groups. One-way ANOVA, p<0.05). We didn\u2019t find any differ -\nence on 16s Firmicutes. DIAB + CMS and DIAB mice showed higher \nlevels of glycemia compared control and CMS groups during all the \ntreatment (Two-way ANOVA, p<0.05). After 3 months CMS expo -\nsure, animals were sacrifice and lamina propria cells were isolated, \nstained with anti CD45-PerCP/Cy5.5 and anti CD3-APC antibodies \nand used for flow cytometry. We found a non-significant decrease in \nCD45 and CD3 cells in DIAB + CMS mice (One-way ANOVA, p=0.08 \nfor CD45 and p=0.07 for CD3). These results suggest that CMS in a \nT1D context, can modulate the microbiota.\n46. (238) FUNCTIONAL EVALUATION OF INCIDENTAL ADRE -\nNAL TUMORS THROUGH THE 1 MG DEXAMETHASONE \nSUPPRESSION TEST DETERMINING CORTISOL IN SE -\nRUM AND SALIVA\nC\u00e9spedes ME1, Contreras LN1;2, Cardoso EML1;2, Arregger \nAL1;2 \n1. Endocrine Research Department, University of Buenos \nAires. \n2. IDIM-CONICET.\nThe subclinical Cushing\u00b4s syndrome (SCS) is found in 20% of in -\ncidental adrenal tumors (AI). The 1 mg oral dexamethasone sup -\npression test (DST) measuring circulating cortisol (F) is a sensitive \nmethod to rule out SCS. The assessment of salivary cortisol (SAF) \nas a surrogate of F became a non-invasive methodological advance. \nThe aim of this study was to investigate the utility of salivary an \nserum cortisol (SAFdex  and Fdex) for the detection of SCS in patients \nwith AI. Twenty subjects with AI (7 male and 13 women; 65.0 \u00b1 11.0 \ny/o) were studied. Eight patients (1 male and 7 women; 20.0-60.0 \ny/o) with overt non ACTH dependent Cushing Syndrome (CS) were \nincluded as the reference group of active hypercortisolism. Subjects \ncollected 24-hour urine for urinary free cortisol (UFC) and obtained \nwhole saliva samples at 23 h for cortisol (SAF23). Subsequently, they \nreceived 1 mg oral dexamethasone. The next day at 8 h, blood (Fdex) \nand saliva (SAFdex) samples were obtained. F, SAF and UFC were \ndetermined by RIA and ACTH by IRMA. Reference values   from our \nlaboratory (n= 100): UFC \u226490.0 \u00b5g / 24hs; ACTH: 10.0-50.0 pg / ml, \nSAF23: 0.5-3.8 nM / l; SAFdex: 0.5-2.0 nM; Fdex: 13.8-50.0 nM. Statis -\ntics were performed by Mann-Whitney and Spearman tests, p <0.05 \nwas considered significant. In AI: ACTH 22.0 \u00b1 11.0 pg /ml; UFC: \n47.0 \u00b1 20.0 \u00b5g / 24hs; SAF23:1.5 \u00b1 0.9 nM); SAFdex: 1.0 \u00b1 0.5nM \nand Fdex: 35.6 \u00b1 10.0 nM were normal and significantly different from \nCS: 5.6\u00b11.8 pg /ml; 391.0 \u00b1 406.0 \u00b5g / 24hs; 20.0 \u00b1 32.0 nM; 27.0 \u00b1 \n24.0 nM and 674.0 \u00b1 339.0 nM, respectively; p <0.05 in all cases. A \npositive and significant correlation was demonstrated between SAF -\ndex and Fdex in AI (r = 0.830) and CS (r = 0.905); p <0.05.\nConclusion: SCS was excluded in all AI. The dexamethasone sup -\npression test using serum and saliva as a diagnostic fluids was a \nsensitive and practical method to rule out hypercortisolism in these \npatients. \n47. (246) A PREPUBERTAL SERTOLI CELL LINE WITH STA -\nBLE EXPRESSION OF THE FSH RECEPTOR\nMariela Urrutia, Rodolfo Rey \nCEDIE.\nBackground: FSH regulates Sertoli cell function during development \nthrough the FSHR, a 692-amino acid G protein-coupled receptor. \nIn vitro studies using Sertoli cell lines are instrumental for the study \nof FSH action. However, no prepubertal Sertoli cell line exists that \nexpresses the FSHR. Our group generated the murine SMAT1 cell \nline, as a model for in vitro study of prepubertal Sertoli cell physi -\nology, but these cells have also lost FSHR expression. Transient \nFSHR transfection of SMAT1 cells is a suboptimal solution, resulting \nin cellular damage and heterogeneous results from one experiment to another. The objective of this work was to generate a prepubertal \nSertoli cell line with stable FSHR expression.\nMethods: 1x106 SMAT1 cells were transfected with 0.2 \u00b5g of pCD -\nNA3-FSHR expression plasmid (8.1 kb) using 1 \u00b5l lipofectamine in \na 24-well plate, and selected by resistance to geneticin (G418). Sur -\nviving cells were subjected to limiting dilution in a 96-well plate to \nobtain a single cell per well. Clones that expanded under G418 were \ntested for FSHR expression by RT-PCR.\nResults: The selective condition was determined as 500 \u00b5g/ml \nof G418, concentration required to provoke massive death of \nnon-transfected SMAT1 cells in 2 weeks. Upon limiting dilution, 21 \nwells containing 1-3 cells were identified and followed for survival \nand cell division for 6 weeks. Eight clones managed to expand in \nthe presence of G418, 6 of which showed cDNA amplification when \ntested for FSHR expression by RT-PCR. One clone presented the \nexpected product size for the FSHR amplified fragment (95 bp). \nProtein expression analysis are underway to fully characterize the \nobtained clone.\nConclusions: By liposome transfection, we have obtained a clone of \nprepubertal mouse Sertoli cell line SMAT1 with stable expression of \nthe FSHR. Following full characterization, this cell line will represent \na unique tool for the study of the physiological regulation of the pre -\npubertal Sertoli by FSH.\n48. (314) IS SUBCUTANEOUS ADIPOSE TISSUE THE MOST \nTHERMOGENIC DEPOT? COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS BE -\nTWEEN TWO RODENT MODELS\nGiordano AP1, Harnichar EA1, Gambaro SE1, Portales AE1, \nAlzamendi A1, Miguel I1, Zubir\u00eda MG1, Giovambattista A1.\n1. Instituto Multidisciplinario de Biolog\u00eda Celular (IMBI -\nCE)-CIC-CONICET-UNLP\nIt is known that cold exposure and \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation acti -\nvate white Adipose Tissue (AT) browning. Also, it has been largely \ndescribed that Subcutaneous AT (SCAT) from rodents has greater \nbrowning capacity. However, most studies were carried out in mice. \nHere, we compared the thermogenic capacity of different white AT \ndepots in rats and mice. Male adult rats and mice were housed at \nRoom Temperature (Rat-RT and Mice-RT) or at Cold Temperature \n(4\u00b0C for 7 days, Rat-CT and Mice-CT). SCAT and Abdominal AT \npads (Epididymal (EAT) for mice and Retroperitoneal (RPAT) for rat) \nwere dissected and processed for UCP-1 and PGC1\u03b1 quantification \n(qRT-PCR). We found that both thermogenic markers were less ex -\npressed in SCAT from rats vs. mice, being even lesser upon cold \nexposure (2way ANOVA, interaction p<0.01). In addition, we com -\npared the thermogenic response of EAT or RPAT vs. SCAT after cold \nstimulation. We found that UCP-1 and PGC1\u03b1 expressions were \nlower in EAT compared to SCAT in mice (p<0.05), as previously de -\nscribed, but the opposite effect was found in RPAT vs. SCAT from \nrats, i.e. high expression of UCP-1 (p<0.01) and a tendency toward \nhigher levels of PGC1 \u237a (p=0.06). Next, we studied the thermogenic \ncapacity of in vitro  differentiated adipocytes from the different AT de -\npots. To this aim, Stromal Vascular Fraction cells were cultured and \ndifferentiated with pro-beige cocktail. At the end of culture, adipo -\ncytes were incubated or not with forskolin and cells were processed \nfor UCP-1 quantification (qRT-PCR). In stimulated conditions, UCP-\n1 levels were lower in mice EAT (p<0.0001), but higher in rat RPAT \n(p<0.0001) compared to their respective SCAT depots. Overall, we \nfound a differential thermogenic response in AT depots and adipo -\ncytes coming from rats or mice. Our results showed, for the first time \nthat the relevance of white AT browning is specie-dependent, being \nlarger in the SCAT from mice and in the RPAT from rats.

Servicio de Endocrinolog\u00eda, Hospital de Pediatr\u00eda \u201cProf. Dr. \nJuan P. Garrahan\u201d.\nLeydig cell tumors (LCT) are testicular neoplasms associated with \nendocrine dysfunctions in boys and adults. Current therapies for be-\nnign LCT entail side effects, while malignant LCT respond poorly to \nchemo/radiotherapy. Hence, new treatment options are needed. C al-\ncitriol (CAL, the active form of vitamin D) has been tested as a ther -\napeutic approach to manage various cancers and is often assayed \nin combination with other drugs to potentiate its effect. Histamine \n(HA) receptor H1 gene has a vitamin D-response element, and we \nhave recently found that CAL induces its expression and decreases \ncell proliferation in Leydig tumor cells. In turn, HA is currently used \nas part of certain anti-cancer regimens, and our previous reports \nindicate that it can reduce the steroidogenic potential of the Leydig \ntumor cell line MA-10 via H1 receptor. Objective: To evaluate the ef -\nfectiveness of a combined CAL+HA treatment in a syngeneic murine \nmodel of LCT. Methods: In vitro : MA-10 cells were treated with CAL \n(10-8 - 10-11M) or HA (10-5 - 10-9 M). StAR protein expression, cell \nproliferation and steroid levels were evaluated by Western blot, SRB \nassay and RIA, respectively. In vivo : Six-week-old male mice CB6F1 \nwith MA-10 cell-derived tumors were treated i.p. with CAL (0.05 \u00b5g), \nHA (0.5 mg/kg), CAL+HA, or vehicle, thrice a week. Results: CAL re -\nduced LCT volume in vivo  (52% inhibition, p<0.01), with no variation \nin plasma steroids vs vehicle-treated mice. While HA was ineffective \nover the time and dosing scheme studied, CAL+HA treatment pro -\nmoted LCT growth (75% increase vs vehicle-treated mice, p<0.001). \nConclusions: CAL emerges as a potential option for LCT treatment. \nHA has no anti-tumor effect. Importantly, combined CAL+HA treat -\nment can be counterproductive for LCT patients. Although further \nresearch is needed, the explanation for this phenomenon could be \nrelated to the interaction between CAL and the histaminergic system \nin multiple cell types beyond Leydig tumor cells in vivo .  \n50.

These hops extracts exhibit chemopreventive, cyto -\ntoxic and anti-inflammatory properties while 8-PN is a potent phy -\ntoestrogen. Although the 8-PN concentration in hops  is very low, XN \n(the most abundant compound) can be metabolized to 8-PN. Here \nwe evaluated the potential estrogenic effects of hops  and knockout  \nhops  (KO-hops ) (reduced in XN and consequently in 8-PN) using \nthe uterotrophic assay. \nFemale Wistar rats (7 weeks old) were bilaterally ovariectomized \n(Ovx). Fourteen days after the surgery, rats were treated for three \nconsecutive days with 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2: 4 \u00b5g/kg bw/day) or fed with \nthe vehicle (Ovx), hops  or KO-hops  at 8, 40 and 200 mg/kg bw/\nday. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last treatment. The uter -\nus was removed, weighed and processed for histology and mRNA \nextraction. We determine the relative uterine weight (rUW), luminal \nepithelial cell height (LECH) and the mRNA expression of the estro -\ngen receptor \u03b1 (Esr1) and complement C3 (C3). \nThe rUW and LECH were increased by E2 respect to Ovx (p<0.05). \nThe rUW was similar between hops, KO -hops  and Ovx groups. An \nincrease in LECH was shown in hops 40  compared to Ovx (p<0.05). \nThe mRNA expression of  Esr1 and C3 was downregulated and \nupregulated, respectively by E2 treatment (p<0.05). Esr1 and C3 \nmRNA were changed neither by hops  nor by KO-hops  respect to \nthe Ovx. \nIn general, no estrogenic uterine effects were observed in response \nto hops  extracts, independently of their composition ( hops  and KO-hops, not showed estrogenic response). In conclusion, the absence \nof uterine estrogenic effects provides evidence for the safety of \nboth extracts. Although this result encourage us to study the hops \nextracts for its chemopreventive properties, more experiments are \nneeded to deeply characterize hops and their compounds.\n51.

Testicular Sertoli cells \nshow differences in proliferative status between infancy and puberty.\nAim: To determine if there is a differential effect of chemotherapy on \nSertoli cell function between children and adolescents with hemato -\nlogic malignancies during and after treatment. Secondarily, testos -\nterone and gonadotropins were evaluated.\nMethods : prospective cohort study in children with acute lympho -\nblastic leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Serum levels of AMH \nand FSH (direct and indirect marker of Sertoli cells, respectively) \nand of testosterone (T) and LH (direct and indirect markers of Ley -\ndig cells) were evaluated during chemotherapy and for 24 months \nafter the end of the treatment. Results were analysed according to \npubertal stage and expressed as median (range).\nResults : 16 prepubertal boys, age 4.2 yr (0.7-7.1), and 5 puber -\ntal, age 13.4 yr (11.7-14.8) were analysed. Follow-up was 4.6 \u00b1 0.6 \nyears. In prepubertal boys, AMH was pre-treatment (tx): 709 pmol/L \n(331-1333), at 3 months (m) of tx: 1191 (396-1660), 6 m: 934 (273-\n1325), 12 m: 577 (338-1474), 24 m (end tx): 1156 (625-1563); in \nthe subsequent follow-up, 3 m: 1096 (532-1708), 12 m: 1212 (603-\n2601) and 24 m: 1011 (520-2035). 24 m after end of tx, serum AMH \nwas higher than baseline in all patients. T, FSH and LH were always \nnormal. In pubertal boys, AMH was pre-tx 74 pmol/L (39-121), 3 m: \n76 (47-98), 6 m: 92 (64-173), 12 m: 74 (55-229), 24 m (end tx): 95 \n(46-118); in follow-up: 3 m: 124 (37-174), 12 m: 140 (76-157) and \n24 m: 129 (32-173). T was always normal. FSH and LH increased \nduring chemotherapy and normalised 24 m after the end of chemo -\ntherapy.\nConclusion : In prepubertal boys, no compromise of Sertoli cell \nfunction was observed during the entire follow-up. In pubertal boys, \na transient elevation of gonadotropins was observed, which may re -\nflect a reversible deleterious effect of chemotherapy.\n52.

According to the last survey about nutri -\ntion and health (2019) in Argentine, 4 out of 10 children are over -\nweight/obese. Our aim was to evaluate, in a male pediatric cohort, \nplasmatic levels of Spexin (SPX), Leptin (Lep) and Adiponectin \n(Adipo) in order to find their relationship with obesity risk factors. \nThe study was approved by the CIRPI of La Plata Children\u2019s Hos -\npital. Physical, biochemical parameters and plasmatic adipokines \nfrom 70 children were evaluated. Patients were classified by their \nBMI z-score (BAZ), ranging from -1 to 1 for control (CTR), from 1 \nto 2 for overweight (OW) and higher than 2 for obese (OB). Re -\nsults revealed no significant differences for glucose and lipid profile, \nwhile for hepatic TGP, GGT and PCR, OB children showed high -\ner levels than CTR. Adipo levels were similar among groups, but \nSPX (CTR=0,79; OW=0,53; OB=0,38 ng/mL; P<0,0001) and Lep \n(CTR=1,95; OW=9,95; OB=17,25 ng/mL; P<0,0001) showed signifi -\ncant differences. Moreover, we found significant correlation for SPX \nvs. BAZ, Lep, insulin, triglycerides (TG), HDL and GGT and for Lep \nvs. BAZ, insulin, TG, SPX, VLDL, PCR, GGT. Finally, principal com -\nponent (PC) analysis was assessed, showing that in PC1 SPX clus -\ntered with insulin, Lep and TG and correlated with BAZ (P<0,001); \nwhereas in PC2, lipid profile and adiponectin clustered together, but \ndid not correlate with BAZ. PC1 explained 39% of variance of the \npopulation, PC2 21% and all together reached 60%. In conclusion, \nwe showed for the first time in an Argentinian pediatric cohort, that \nplasmatic SPX levels decreased as BAZ increase and SPX and Lep \nwere able to discriminate among groups, according to BAZ range. \nMoreover, we demonstrated by PC analysis that SPX, Lep, Insulin \nand TG clustered together and explained in a higher proportion the \nvariance of the population, reflecting the global metabolic status of \npatients.

Centro de Microscopia Electr\u00f3nica, Facultad de Ciencias \nM\u00e9dicas, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, INICSA-CONI -\nCET\nFilamin A (FLNA) is an acting binding protein that is deregulated \nin pituitary tumours and plays a role in lamellipodia formation. Cy -\nclin D1 (CD1) is increased in tumours, but is not always correlat -\ned with cell cycle progression. FLNA and CD1 localized on cellular \nprotrusions and physically interact to regulate cell motility. We hy -\npothesized that FLNA promotes CD1 expression with non-canonical \nfunctions in pituitary cells. The objective was to analyse the effect of \nFLNA over CD1 expression and function on lactotroph cells.\nTransfected GH3 cells for FLNA overexpression (GH3F+) and pi -\ntuitary glands from female rats treated with estradiol benzoate for \n20, 40 and 60 days, as pituitary hyperplastic adenomatous model, \nwere used. FLNA and CD1 expression was analysed by Western \nblot and subcellular localization by immunocytochemistry (ICC). Cell \ncycle progression was analysed by flow cytometry, Ki67 index by \nICC, colony formation capacity by clonogenic assay, and cellular \nmorphology was performed by optical microscopy. The statistical \nanalysis used was ANOVA-Tukey.\nGH3 FLNA overexpression induced CD1 increase with low prolifer -\nation rate detected by Ki67 index and clonogenic assay, suggesting \nthat is not exerting canonical functions. Also, the GH3F+ morpholog -\nical analysis showed a significant increase in cells with lamellipodia, \ndoubling the pleomorphic cell number, which showed diffuse cyto -\nplasmic CD1 distribution, suggesting an involvement of cytoplasmic \nCD1 in cell motility.\nFLNA increased gradually until the 40 days of pituitary hyperplas -\ntic glands and declined at 60 days, similar to cyclin D1 expression \npattern. Cell cycle analysis revealed a proliferation phase S/G2-M \ndeclined at 40 days, suggesting that CD1 expression does not cor -\nrelate with cell cycle progression.\nOur results suggest that FLNA enhanced CD1 expression, without \naffecting cell cycle progression, leading to non-canonical functions, \npossibly related to cell protrusion formation.\n54.

INICSA-CONICET\nDi-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most commonly used \nphthalate, non-covalently bounded to PVC polymers, acting as en -\ndocrine disruptor by interfering with estrogen signaling. One of the \nmost relevant targets of E2 actions is the pituitary gland, whose en -\ndocrine populations expresses receptors (ER) and is sensitive to \nE2 variations. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect and \ngender differences of perinatal DEHP exposure on pituitary ER\u03b2 ex -\npression, exploring the impact on lactotroph cell growth. \nFemale Wistar rats were exposed to DEHP (200mg/kg) or corn oil \n(controls) by gavage from day 0 of gestation, throughout pregnan -\ncy and lactation, until weaning. Male and female pups were used \nat 21 (prepubertal) and 75 (adult) postnatal (PND) days. Also, pi -\ntuitary cultures from male and female rats were stimulated for 72h \nwith 1, 10 or 100 nM of DEHP. The ER\u03b2+ cells were determined by \nflow cytometry and the lactotroph (ki67+) were quantified by double \nimmunostaining. The statistical analysis used was ANOVA Fisher \n(P<0.05).\nPerinatal DEHP increased ER\u03b2 expression in prepuberal and adult \nmale rats. However, in female rats while DEHP also increased ER\u03b2 \nexpression in prepubertal rats, the ER\u03b2 decreased in adulthood. \nIn vitro  system, all tested doses of DEHP up regulated the ER\u03b2+ \ncells in cultures from male, with opposite effects in female cultures, \nshowing ER\u03b2 decrease in a dose-dependent manner. Also, DEHP \nreduced the lactotroph Ki67+ cells in male, with contrary effect in \nfemale rats showing that DEHP increased lactotroph Ki67+ cells. \nThese results showed that DEHP exposition during embryogenesis \nand perinatal development induces changes in the pituitary gland, \nwith differential effect on ER\u03b2 expression in male and female rats \nand lactotroph cell growth. These changes in ER expression may \nbe a mechanism underlying DEHP exposure in the pituitary gland, \nleading to cell growth deregulation.\n55.

We used \nthe murine pituitary cell line GHFT-1, engineered to express bioti -\nnylated Prop1, and conducted RNA-seq and RIME experiments. Dif -\nferential gene expression analysis indicated that Prop1 upregulated \n240 genes and downregulated 201 genes in Prop1 cell line com -\npared to control (fold change=l1.5l). DAVID analysis showed that the \nmost regulated GO terms were related to extracellular matrix, cell \nadhesion and junctions and positive regulation of proliferation and \ncell migration, among others. These results are in accordance with \nprevious reports showing that Prop1 guides pituitary development \nthrough an EMT-like process.\nTo study Prop1 TC we used RIME and identified 786 proteins that \nimmunoprecipitated with Prop1. DAVID analysis showed enrichment \nin GO terms related to cell adherens junction, cadherin-binding in -\nvolved in cell-cell adhesion, focal adhesion, RNA binding and splic -\ning, spliceosome and chromatin binding. To further unveil Prop1 \npartners we used LISA which predicts transcriptional regulators \nusing chromatin accessibility and histone mark ChIP-seq data. We \nused as input the genes that intersected from the ChIP and RNA-\nseq experiments and obtained 536 genes, DAVID analysis showed \nthat the main GO terms were transcription regulation, in utero em -\nbryonic development, steroid hormone pathway, cell differentiation, MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 202062\nchromatin remodeling and stem cells commitment, among others. \nOf these genes 37 were present in the RIME, i.e.: Stat3, Nfib, Sin3a \nand Ctnnb1. Further experimental work is needed to validate Prop1 \ninteraction partners. Understanding the TC formed will shed light on \nthe pivotal role of Prop1 in pituitary development.\n56.

However, antiTg antibodies interfere with this mea -\nsurement and produce falsely low Tg levels that can be misleading \nin up to 20% of patients. The search for alternative methods to as -\nsess the presence of circulating Tg is warranted. Objective: Deter -\nmine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of mRNA of Tg \n(Tg- mRNA) levels measured by quantitative RT-PCR in patients \nfollowed for DTC. Methods: This is a prospective study of Tg-mRNA \nlevels measured with qRT-PCR in patients followed for DTC without \nevidence of disease (69), and persistence of structural disease (23), \nas well as 28 patients without evidence of disease who had not re -\nceived RAI ablation. RNA was obtained using Ribo Pure Blood and \nthen the RT-PCR was performed. Results were analyzed using the \nUnity Real-Time program and expressed as fg/ \u03bcg ARN.  We used \na ROC curve to identify the best cutoff level to distinguish between \npatients with structural disease persistence and without. Results :We \nrecruited 120 patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy, and \n92 had received RAI ablation. Patients with structural persistence \nshowed Tg mRNA levels of [0.133 fg/ \u03bcg ARN (0.07-0.33)] and those \nwith no evidence of disease [0.10 fg/ \u03bcg ARN (0.08-0.17)](P<0.06). \nPatients who had not received RAI ablation showed Tg mRNA levels \nsimilar to those who had [0.11 fg/\u03bcg ARN (0.05-0.27)]. Sensitivity \nwas 69.6%, specificity was 59.4%,negative predictive value was \n85.4%positive predictive value 36.4%. Conclusions:  Tg mRNA lev -\nels were not significantly different between patients with structural \npersistence and those with no evidence of disease.Our experience \nshows that Tg-mRNA could be useful as a rule-out test in selected \ncases, but its low sensitivity and specificity precludes its usefulness \nas a first-line test.  \n57.

Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Sala -\nmanca, Espa\u00f1a.\nThe congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common endocrine \ndisease characterized by low levels of circulating thyroid hormones. \nThe prevalence of CH is 1 in 2000-3000 live births. Variants in Thy -\nroperoxidase (TPO) appear to be one of the causes of dyshormono -\ngenesis with permanent CH. TPO is  a membrane-bound glycopro -\ntein. The TPO gene is located in chromosome 2 [2p25], comprises \n17 exons, covers approximately 150 kb of genomic DNA and en -\ncodes 933 amino acids. The TPO enzyme activity depends on both \nproper folding and membrane insertion, and an intact catalytic site. \nIn the present work, we present the analysis of 25 patients from 20 \nunrelated families with TPO variants identified in our laboratorory.  \nWe include the first case in which a variant in the TPO gene was \nidentified worldwide,  an argentinian boy presenting a h omozygous \nduplication of a tetranucleotide GGCC in exon 8. All patients un -\nderwent clinical and biochemical evaluation. Sanger technique as \nwell NGS technique using a custom panel targeting 8 genes asso -\nciated with dishormonogenesis (TPO, IYD, SLC26A4, TG, DUOX2, \nDUOXA2, TSHR, SLC5A5) and bioinformatics analysis were per -\nformed. Our observation shows that variants in both TPO alleles \nwere found in 16 families (2 as homozygote and 14 as heterozygote \ncompound), whereas in 3 families only 1 variant was detected. In \nthe remaing family, 1 TPO allele and 1 IYD allele showed variants.  \n20 different variants were identified of which 14 were novel (9 mis -\nsense, 2 deletions, 1 nonsense, 1 duplication and 1 splicing). Ad-\nditionally, we present an updated database from international bib -\nliography and the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Our \nfindings suggest monoallelic variants and oligogenic inheritance are \nalso involved in the pathogenesis of CH. The identification and char -\nacterization of TPO variants is undoubtedly a valuable approach to \nstudy the TPO structure/function relations and for the elaboration of \na clinical diagnosis and genetic counseling.\n58.

It is used to illustrate results through 3D images. In the \npresent report, the combination of CBCT with other techniques was \nused to evaluate changes in composition and micro-architectural \nstructure quantity of the ewe jawbone after oestrogen withdrawal \n(OVX) and/or chronic treatment with high doses of zoledronic acid \n(zol). Three groups of adult Corriedale ewes, 35 to 40 kg body \nweight were used: OVX: OVX ewes receiving saline solution; ZOL: \nOVX ewes treated with Zol (4 mg/month) for 28 months for high \ncumulative dose of ZOL in bones and SHAM: SHAM ewes receiv -\ning saline solution (control). At the end of the study, hemi-mandibles \nwere extracted: Bone mineral density (BMD) and content (BMC) of \nthe mandibles were evaluated ex vivo by DXA (Lunar DPX); CBCT \nwas performed using Planmeca Promax 3D Classic. Results of \nCBCT: OVX as compared to SHAM ewes significantly decreased \nBMC and BMD (p<0.001); BV/ TV (%), Tb. Th, connectivity and an -\nisotropy (p<0.0075; p<0.0075, p<0.001 and p<0.02, respectively) \nwhile Tb. Sp (p<0.0002) was significantly increased. Zol treatment \ndid not show statistical differences when compared to SHAM group. \nZol showed values of anisotropy significantly higher than OVX group \n(p<0.018) and Tb.Sp significantly lower than OVX groups (p<0.043). \nBV/ TV (%), Tb. Th and connectivity as compared to OVX group \nshowed a clear tendency to be higher and  almost reached signifi -\ncance (p=0.055; p=0.061 and p=0.054, respectively. Maxillary BMC \nand BMD were lowest in OVX ewes (p<0.05) and were significantly \nhigher in ZOL than in SHAM ewes (p<0.05). Conclusion: The CBCT \ntechnique was useful to evaluate the deterioration of the bone quali -ABSTRACTS63\nty by estrogen withdrawal and the recovery by ZOL treatment.\n59.

In acute disease, triiodo -\nthyronine (T3) is reduced with or without changes in the remaining \nthyroid profile and it is the Non-Thyroid Illness Syndrome (NTIS).\nOur main objective is describe T3 levels in patients with clinical pic -\nture compatible with COVID-19 infection. Materials and methods: 56 \nadults of both sexes (July-August 2020), admitted to public hospital, \nwith a clinical/epidemiological presentation for COVID19. The de -\nmographic, clinical and confirmatory diagnosis data were recovered \nfrom the epidemiological file and the Notification Sistem. T3 was \ndosed by chemiluminescence in ARCHITECT-ABBOTT. The results \nwere expressed as mean \u00b1 SD, T test, chi square and linear correla -\ntion, p<0.05. Results: In an adult population of 25 women and 31 \nmen, 43 COVID19 cases (G1) were confirmed and in 13 (G2) it was \nruled out. The mean time to onset of symptoms and consultation \nwas 4 days. 59% of G1 and 69% of G2 had comorbidities. 21% of \nG1 (2 deceased) and 7.7% G2 required critical care, p <0.05. G1 \nreferred cough, fever, respiratory distress and general discomfort \nand G2 added myalgia and gastrointestinal symptoms. T3 (ng/dL) \nin G1 and G2 were 65.8 \u00b1 21.8 and 70.4 \u00b1 23.1, presenting a sig -\nnificant difference with respect to the general adult population. 67% \nof G1 and 46% of G2 presented T3 below 70 ng/dL. No correlation \nwas found between symptoms and T3. In febrile subjects, T3 (ng/\ndL) were 67.8 \u00b1 23.7 in G1, 75.6 \u00b1 14.3 in G2 and 71.6 \u00b1 24.2 fever -\nless. In critical patients G1, T3 was 53.0 \u00b1 16.2, G1 mild/ moderate \ninfection 68.8 \u00b1 22.1, deaths less than 50.0 ng/dL, p <0.05. No differ -\nence between sexes was found. Conclusion: Significant decrease in \nT3 is observed in patients requiring hospitalization. NTIS is present \nin 50% of COVID19 patients. In critically ill COVID, T3 decreases \nsharply, possibly related to the severity and poor prognosis of the \ninfection.\n60.

DCs are spe -\ncialized antigen presenting cells. T3 activates mice DCs (T3-DCs) \ninducing Th1 and Th17 proinflammatory, and cytotoxic responses, \nrestraining Tregs. On this basis, antitumor antigen-specific T3-DCs \nbased vaccination strategies were exploited successfully for mel -\nanoma and colon cancer in mice. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are \nnano-sized membrane vesicles that play key roles in intercellular \ncommunication. We reported that EVs released by T3-DCs (T3-EVs) \nactivated syngeneic DCs with a pro-inflammatory profile, contribut -\ning to paracrine DC communication in vitro . To go further, t he aim of \nthis study was to evaluate the adaptive modulatory role of T3-EVs. \nBone marrow DCs obtained from C57BL/6 WT mice were stimulated \n(or not) with T3 (10nM) for 18h. DC-EV fractions were isolated by \ndifferential ultracentrifugation of culture supernatants (2,000g: 2K; \n10,000g: 10K; and 100,000g: 100K). Allogenic splenocytes were \nobtained from BALB/c mice and stimulated with DC-EV fractions \nof T3-stimulated and Control (C) cells for 6 days. Intracellular and \nsecreted cytokine production were analyzed by flow cytometry \nand ELISA. Statistical analysis: Sidak\u2019s multiple comparisons test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results showed that \n100 K and 2K T3-EVs increased CD8 splenocyte subpopulation (vs \ntheir C). Moreover, the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 were augment -\ned in splenocyte cultures after 2K T3-EVs stimulus (vs C). Similarly, \n10K T3-EVs augmented IL17 secretion (vs C). We conclude that T3-\nEVs activated allogenic splenocytes increasing CD8 subpopulation  \nin vitro,  in an EV-fraction dependent manner. Besides, the secre -\ntion of splenocyte pro-inflammatory cytokines augmented after 2K \nand 10K T3-EVs stimulus.  This study underscores the role of EVs \nin immune-endocrine crosstalk and provides initial tools for future \ndesigns of T3-DC based immunotherapies. Further research to en -\nlighten this topic is under course.\n61.

The aim of this study was to determine \nwhether NAR modifies the redox state of liver mitochondria altering \nthe Krebs cycle function, which could lead to perturbations in the \nmitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis. Male Wistar rats were di -\nvided into three groups: 1) controls, 2) STZ rats (diabetes induced \nby 60 mg/kg b.w. STZ), 3) STZ rats treated daily with NAR (40 mg/\nkg b.w.) for 30 days. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated from the \ndifferent groups of animals. Oxidative stress parameters, activities \nof Krebs cycle enzymes and ATP synthase as well as mitochon -\ndrial dynamics and biogenesis markers were determined. Results \nwere evaluated by ANOVA and Bonferroni test. STZ rats showed \ndecreased isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) and malate dehydro -\ngenase (MDH) activities affecting ATP synthesis. NAR completely \nblocked these alterations. STZ rats also presented hepatic mito -\nchondrial oxidative stress, as indicated by a lower GSH level and \nhigher superoxide anion and protein carbonyl contents and catalase \nactivity. NAR administration avoided these changes. STZ rats de -\ncreased the gene expression of Drp-1 and Mfn-2, two molecules \ninvolved in the mitochondrial dynamics, an effect that was blocked \nby NAR. The gene expression of Pgc1-\u03b1 and Tfam, two molecules \ninvolved in the mitochondrial biogenesis, remained unchanged in all \ngroups. In conclusion, the experimental diabetes produces oxidative \nstress, decrease in the activity of enzymes from the Krebs cycle and \nATP synthase and alteration in the mitochondrial dynamics. NAR \nprotects the liver mitochondria against the dysfunction produced by \nSTZ-induced diabetes.\nFARMACOLOG\u00cdA\n62.

Instituto de Servicios Sociales de la Universidad Nacional \ndel Nordeste (ISSUNNE)\nDrugs for the treatment of gastric hyperacidity are widely used, often \nwithout scientific basis, subjecting the patient to possible risks and \ngenerating an increase in healthcare costs. Objective: To character -\nize the dispensing of drugs used for the treatment of gastric hyper -acidity in the pharmacy of the University Social Security Institute of \nCorrientes. Materials and methods: A quantitative, descriptive and \ncross-sectional study was carried out during 2019 in which outpa -\ntient dispensations of drugs used for the treatment of gastric hy -\nperacidity were analyzed. The drugs were classified quantitatively \naccording to the Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical Classification \nof Medicines of the World Health Organization. Dispensations that \nincluded drugs with action on the digestive system and metabolism \n(A), specifically the ones used for the treatment of gastric hyper -\nacidity (A02), were selected, and the defined daily doses (DDD) \nwere calculated. Descriptive statistics were performed. Results: Of \n43,748 drugs in group A, 7,164 (16.38%) were A02. Of these, 6,404 \n(89%) were monodrugs and 760 (11%) were fixed-dose combina -\ntions (CDF). 55% were Women. Average age was 54.77 (SD +/- \n12). The DDD of A02 as monodrugs: proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): \nOmeprazole (72,549), Esomeprazole (43,228), Pantoprazole \n(31,934), Dexlansoprazole (13,260) and Rabeprazole (1,442); H2 \nreceptor antagonists: Ranitidine (20,190.40). Other agents against \npeptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux: Sucralfate (1,460). Of the \nCDFs, the A02s most dispensed were: Ranitidine (378), magnesium \nsalts (140), Omeprazole (79), Famotidine (50) and Misoprostol (5). \nConclusions: Within the A02s, PPIs represent the majority of the \ndrugs dispensed. In recent years, there has been an increase in \nthe prescription of drugs, making it necessary to request for them to \nbe used only for accepted indications and for the appropriate time.\n65. (110) DRUG UTILIZATION STUDY: BENZODIAZEPINES \nPRESCRIBED IN A UNIVERSITY SOCIAL SECURITY IN -\nSTITUTE.

Universidad Nacional del Nordeste\n2-Instituto de Servicios Sociales de la Universidad Nacional \ndel Nordeste (ISSUNNE)\nBenzodiazepines (BZD) are one of the most prescribed drugs in the \nworld to treat anxiety and insomnia, but their use is not without risk.\nObjective: to characterize the prescription of BZD in a Universi -\nty Social Security institute. Materials and methods: a descriptive, \ncross-sectional study was carried out in which all BZD outpatient \ndispensations from January to May/2020 were analyzed. The An -\natomical, Therapeutic, Chemical classification of Medicines (ATC-\n2020) of the World Health Organization was used. Subgroups \nN05CD (Derived from BZD) and N05CF (Related to BZD) were \nexclusively selected; and the defined daily doses (DDD) were cal -\nculated. Qualitative classification: Potential Intrinsic Therapeutic \nValue (Laporte-Tognoni) was used. Data was analyzed in Excel \nspreadsheet. The 8 mg DDD (as an anticonvulsant) was adapted to \na non-antiepileptic dose of 1 mg/day. Results: 3,449 drugs with ac -\ntion on the central nervous system (CNS) were prescribed, of which \n2,489 (72%) were BZD: 2,131 (85.6%) as mono-drugs and 358 \n(14, 4%) as fixed-dose combinations (CDF). Median age: 56 (SD \n+/- 14). Range: 3 to 94 years old, 1102 (44%) prescriptions were in \npatients \u2265 60 years. Prescriptions for females: 1,483 (59.6%). BZD \nmost prescribed as mono-drugs and their respective DDDs: Clonaz -\nepam (62,071), Alprazolam (33,585), Lorazepam (4,574), Diazepam \n(2,550), Zolpidem (5,946), Bromazepam in CDF: 312. Conclusions: \nBZDs were the most frequent drugs prescribed within drugs of ac -\ntion on the CNS, the majority in women, with a median close to the \nthird age, high percentage in people \u2265 60 years. Clonazepam and \nalprazolam were the BZD most prescribed as mono-drugs, broma -\nzepam in irrational CDF. Its high consumption exposes this popula -\ntion group to serious health risks, ranging from memory disorders, \ntraffic accidents and an increase in the probability of the appearance \nof Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\n66. (111) ASSESSMENT OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE ANTI -\nHISTAMINE AZELASTINE ON THE ONSET OF GLUCO -\nCORTICOID-INDUCED ADVERSE EFFECTS. CONSE -\nQUENCES ON BONE METABOLISM.\nKelly AS1, Torralba Agu V1, Zappia CD1, Monczor F1\n1. Laboratorio de Farmacolog\u00eda de Receptores. ININFA, \nUBA-CONICET. Argentina. ABSTRACTS65\nWe have previously described in vitro that histamine H1 receptor \nligands potentiate the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids \n(GCs) and established its therapeutic potential in a murine asthma \nmodel. Though, it is crucial to evaluate how this crosstalk alters the \nonset of GC-induced adverse effects to assess cotreatment safe -\nty. Considering that the therapeutic use of GCs is often limited by \nbone loss, we used the MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells differentiated \nwith ascorbic acid and \u03b2-glycerophosphate as an in-vitro  model to \nstudy the joint effect of dexamethasone (DEX) and the antihistamine \nazelastine (AZE) on the expression of bone biomarkers determi -\nnants of the balance between bone formation and resorption. Treat -\nment of the cells with 0.1 nM DEX reduced osteoprotegerin (OPG) \nand increased receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) expres -\nsion in a 17% and 100% respectively, while pre-treatment with 10 \n\u00b5M of AZE reversed both effects by increasing OPG and decreasing \nRANKL expression in a 92% and 66% respectively (p<0,05). Addi -\ntionally, treatment with 1 nM DEX reduced osteocalcin (OC) gene \nexpression in 48%, while in cells pre-treated with 10 \u00b5M AZE this \nreduction was 16% (p<0,05). These findings suggest that co-treat -\nment might represent an advantage in terms of bone impairment. \nWe also performed the MTS metabolic assay to assess the effect of \nAZE on cell proliferation. Treatment with DEX inhibited cell prolifer -\nation in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching the maximal \neffect at 1 \u00b5M, while pretreatment of cells with 1 \u00b5M AZE potentiated \nDEX inhibition, evidenced by a reduction of its pEC50 in one order \nof magnitude (8.28 \u00b1 0.44 to 9.38 \u00b1 0.2, p<0,05). In contrast with our \nprevious results, this suggests that cotreatment might be unsafe in \nterms of bone impairment. Overall, these discrepancies grant fur -\nther research to elucidate the composite effect and the molecular \nmechanisms by which antihistamines modulate the appearance of \nGC-induced adverse effects.\n67. (183) MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY OF CAENORHAB -\nDITIS ELEGANS  SEROTONIN-GATED CHLORIDE CHAN -\nNEL MOD-1 AS A NOVEL DRUG TARGET FOR ANTHEL -\nMINTIC THERAPY\nRodriguez Araujo N, Corradi J, Bouzat C\nInstituto de Investigaciones Bioqu\u00edmicas de Bah\u00eda Blanca \n(INIBIBB-UNS/CONICET) \nSerotonin-gated ion channels (5-HT3) belong to the family of Cys-\nloop receptors, which are pentameric proteins that mediate fast syn -\naptic transmission. In mammals, 5-HT3 are non-selective cationic \nchannels that can be homomeric (5-HT3A) or heteromeric. Caenor -\nhabditis elegans  is a model for the study of the nervous system \nand for antiparasitic drug discovery. As parasitic nematodes, C. el -\negans  contains a homomeric 5HT-gated chloride channel, MOD-1, \nthat modulates locomotory behavior. Due to its absence in verte -\nbrates, MOD-1 emerges as a potential antiparasitic drug target. We \ndeciphered its pharmacological properties and searched for novel \nligands by patch clamp recordings from mammalian cells heterolo -\ngously expressing MOD-1. Macroscopic currents activated by 5-HT \nshowed that MOD-1 does not rectify, desensitizes slowly, and re -\ncovers from desensitization with a time constant of 1 s. Dose-re -\nsponse curves revealed an EC50 for 5-HT of about 1 \u00b5M, similar \nto that of human 5-HT3A receptors. However, compared to their \nactions as partial agonists of human 5-HT3A receptors, tryptamine \nshowed markedly increased efficacy and 2-Me-5HT showed insig -\nnificant agonist activity at MOD-1. The typical anthelmintic drugs \nivermectin (IVM), levamisole, and piperazine, which are agonists of \nGluCl, L-AChR and GABA receptors, respectively, did not activate \nMOD-1. However, IVM produced a slight and piperazine a profound \ninhibition of 5-HT activated MOD-1 currents. The analysis revealed \nthat piperazine is a noncompetitive antagonist of MOD-1. To gain \nfurther insights into the molecular function of the native MOD-1, \nwe also recorded 5HT-activated chloride channels from C. elegans  \nneurons expressing MOD-1 and compared to those heterologous -\nly expressed in mammalian cells. The elucidation of the molecular \npharmacology of MOD-1 contributes to our knowledge of the func -\ntion and drug selectivity of Cys-loop receptors and to its potential as \na novel target for anthelmintic therapy. 68.

Clinical Hospital. (UBA/CONICET))\nINIGEM (UBA/CONICET)\nPeriodontitis is a highly prevalent, chronic disease that induces a \nprogressive bone resorption.  Intermittent PTH administration has \nanabolic and anti-inflammatory effects, two properties necessary to \nachieve bone recovery. Periodontal disease can be experimentally \ninduced in rats in few days, via cotton ligatures placement in the \ngingival sulcus around the molar teeth, that increases biofilm accu -\nmulation and disruption of the gingival epithelium, enhancing osteo -\nclastogenesis and bone loss. We investigated whether intermittent \nadministration of a low dose of PTH 1-34 in rats would block the \nalveolar bone loss observed when the ligature model of periodon -\ntitis was used. Periodontitis was induced in 16 female Wistar rats \n(221\u00b115g) under light anesthesia. Ligature was replaced every 4 \ndays. Rats were randomly divided in two groups and subcutane -\nously injected every 48 hs for 18 ds. with: G1 saline solution and \nG2 1.2ug PTH1-34. Eight rats were left unligated as healthy con -\ntrol. After killed hemimandibles were extracted and fixed in forma -\nlin buffer for histologic analysis of tibia subchondral bone volume \n(BV/TV%), alveolar bone BV/TV% and periodontal space height \n(PSH). Results: tibia BV/TV%: C 38.77\u00b12.59; G1 38.29\u00b13.9 and G2 \n37.75\u00b11.45; alveolar bone BV/TV%  C 50.3\u00b13.6c; G1 35.6\u00b14.3a and \nG2 42.0\u00b11.4b; PSH (mm): C: 0.196\u00b10.057a; G1 0.809\u00b10.115b and \nG2:  0.706\u00b10.065c. Different letters show a p<0.05. The results ev -\nidenced no systemic effect of PTH treatment on the tibia.  Alveolar \nbone composed by trabecular bone showed a significant recovery. \nThe PSH evidenced a little recovery but a greater percentage of os -\nteoid tissue as compared to untreated rats. Conclusion: Intermittent \nlow doses of PTH administration diminishes alveolar bone loss, but \nincreases osteoid formation, suggesting that intermittent PTH ad -\nministration attenuates periodontitis alveolar bone loss by the induc -\ntion of tissue regeneration.

The reports \nof the envenenation surveillance program (8 years) were compared \nwith the international VigiBase registries (45 years). The reported \nreactions were classified by MedDRA, severity and seriousness. \nFrequencies were corrected for time, and average frequencies were \ncompared with international reports. A total of 1,250 envenenation \nreporting forms using antivenoms were analyzed. A total of 88 ad -\nverse reactions were described (7.04% of patients), correspond -\ning to 75 early reactions (mostly nauseas, vomiting, and local re -\nactions), and 13 late reactions (linked to possible cases of serum \nsickness). A total of 88,98% of cases were non-serious adverse re -\nactions, Reactions were predictable (87%), preventable (94%) and \nrequired medical treatment in only 15% of cases. All of them evolved MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 202066\nwith ad-integrum restitution. On a VigiAccess search (1975-2020), \n572 notifications were found, with an average frequency per year \nsimilar to that obtained with local products (11 reports of reactions \nper year), and similar frequencies of reports per reaction, except for \na significantly lower local frequency of serious reactions and a sig -\nnificantly higher percentage incidence of pruritus (67%). The anal -\nysis shows that the report of serious reactions at the local level is \nless than half the worldwide frequency found with similar monitoring \ntechniques, suggesting a good safety profile.\n70.

For \nthat matter, we have developed a nanotechnology-based delivery \nsystem for brain targeting, after its oral administration. Loperamide \nwas chosen since it does not cross the BBB, but exhibits anti-in -\nflammatory activity, along with its mu-opioid-mediated analgesic ef -\nfects, and non-mu-receptor associated neuroprotective properties, \nthus having potential advantages over morphine. Therefore, in this \nwork, we evaluated the capacity of nanocarriers of Eudragit\u00ae RS \n(ERS) covered with poloxamer 188 (P188) and loaded with lopera -\nmide (NP-Lop), for crossing the BBB and reduce protein oxidative \nstress. Methods: Central biodistribution was assessed by evaluat -\ning NP-Lop supraspinal analgesic effects in rats naive submitted to \nthe Hot Plate Test, after its oral and intraperitoneal administration. \nProtein oxidative stress was measure in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of \nrats submitted to traumatic brain injury (TBI), by advance oxidative \nprotein products (AOPP) colorimetric assay, after NP-Lop intrave -\nnous administration. Confidence interval was set at 95%; statistical \nanalysis was performed by t-student comparison or ANOVA and \nTukey test. Results: NP-Lop increased maximum possible effect in \nthe Hot Plate test at 30 min, 2 and 24 h after both, ip and vo NP-Lop \nadministration, in about 20 and 60-fold regarding loperamide in solu -\ntion (Lop/Sol). In addition, NP-Lop reduce AOPP in about 6.7-fold \nregarding TBI. Conclusion: NP-Lop enhance loperamide CNS bio -\ndistribution, and reduces AOPP in a TBI rat model. Finally, the nano -\ncarriers synthesized are potentially a nanopharmaceutical form that \nmay enhance gastrointestinal absorption of drugs like loperamide.\n71. (425) Risk of QT Prolongation related to Drug used in \nCOVID-19: Use of a database mining strategy to detect \nrisk and predict adverse reactions.\nKeller GA1;2, Ferreir\u00f3s Gago ML2, Di Salvo HE1, Diez RA2, Di \nGirolamo G2.\n1. Hospital General de Agudos Donaci\u00f3n Francisco J. San -\ntojanni\n2. Universidad de Buenos Aires, Facultad de Medicina, Cen -\ntro de Vigilancia y Seguridad de Medicamentos.\n \nIntroduction: The search for effective drugs in COVID led to an insuf -\nficient assessment of adverse reactions. Hydroxychloroquine was \nhas a known risk of arrhytmia and was used without proven efficacy. \nThis situation may have been partially repeated for other drugs. We \nanalyzed the FAERS database in search of signals of new asso -\nciations. Methods: FAERS reports (2004 to 2020) were analyzed. \nThe Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) was \nused to identify TdP/QTP cases. We calculated the Reporting Odds \nRatios (RORs), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PPR), Yule\u2019s Q, and Chi Square with Yate\u2019s correction for the association between each \nDrug used in CoViD treatment, moxifloxacine (positive control) and \nceftriaxone (negative control) using MedDRA Standarized Medical \nQuerry for QT Prolongation. Signals were defined as lower limit of \nthe 95%CI greater than 1.0 (for ROR or PPR), greater than 0 (Yule\u2019s \nQ) or a P value less than 0,05 (Chi Square). Results: 17.734.379 \nreports (including 48.364 arrhytmias) were analyzed. No signifi -\ncant signals were found for Dexamethasone, Remdesivir, ritonavir \n/ lopinavir, and Ceftriaxone. A significant signal was found for pro -\nlonged qt prolongation and arrhythmias for: hydroxychlorocine 1.23 \n(1.10 to 1.56); ivermectin 1.63 (1.09 to 4.51); tocilizumab 1.07 (1.02 \nto 0.28); ticarcilina clavulanico 3.57 (2.60 to 4.91); piperacillin + ta -\nzobactam 2.32 (2.17 to 2.48); ampicillin + sulbactam 1.91 (1.68 to \n2.17); clarithromycin 1.46 (1.37 to 1.55); azithromycin 1.54 (1.44 to \n1.64); and moxifloxacin 1.84 (1.76 to 1.93). Discussion: There is not \nonly a risk of arrhythmias with drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, \nbut also with antibiotics used in the management of COVID (ampi -\ncillin + sulbactam, clarithromycin), and other drugs under study for \npotential efficacy in COVID (azithromycin, toxilizumab, ivermectin). \nThis information must be taken into account to monitor the ECG \nand prevent pharmacodynamic interactions that enhance the effect.\n72. (492) PHARMACOLOGICAL INHIBITORS OF THE MO -\nLECULAR CHAPERONE HSP90\nCiucci S1, Erlejman A1, Galigniana M1;2, Mazaira G1.\n1. Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica, FCEN, UBA.\n2. IByME \u2013 CONICET.\nHsp90 is a molecular chaperone that stabilizes in an ATP-dependent \nmanner the active conformation of many proteins with stable tertiary \nstructure. Several substrate proteins of this chaperone are related \nto tumor development and progression, hence making Hsp90 an at -\ntractive target for antitumor therapy. The inhibition of Hsp90 activity \nshows strong anticancer effects, and Hsp90 inhibitors seem to be \nthe only chemotherapeutic agents capable to affect all cancer hall -\nmarks. Unfortunately, one of the most efficient inhibitors, Geldana -\nmycin (GA), cannot be used in clinical trials because of its harmful \nside-effects. \nIn the present work we evaluated the capability of synthetized com -\npounds designed by molecular modelling to inhibit the ATPase ac -\ntivity of Hsp90, and their effects on the biological actions mediat -\ned by this chaperone, such as PC3 cell viability and migration, as \nwell as GR transport to the nucleus after hormonal stimulation in \nHEK293T-transfected cells. In all the cases, GA was used as an \ninhibitory control. Nine compounds named S3, S8, S31, S42, A15, \nC3, C6, N15 and P1 were tested. All of them confirmed the in sili -\nco predictions regarding their ability to inhibit the intrinsic ATPase \nactivity of Hsp90. The S-series of dihydroxybenzaldheyde-derived \nSchiff bases and C-series of pyrazoline-derived drugs (especially \nC3 and C6) showed a decreased action on cell viability comparable \nto that shown by GA, but only S3, S8, S31 and S42 decreased cell \nmigration comparable to the positive control. None of the synthetics \ndrugs affected the GR nuclear import. \nIn summary, in this study we described various synthetic candidates \nwith high pharmacological potential. Importantly, it is also shown that \nHsp90 ATPase activity is not an essential requirement for cell via -\nbility and GR nuclear import, which opposites the prevailing dogma. \nFISIOLOG\u00cdA CELULAR \n73.

Novel \nevidence suggests that dyslipidemias and other factors of the Meta -\nbolic Syndrome are associated to BPH progression and aggressive -\nness. However, little information is available about the pathogenic \nmechanisms promoting prostatic growth in atherogenic contexts. \nWe therefore aimed to analyze in vitro the effects of OxLDL on pri -\nmary cell cultures. Prostatic stromal cells, surgically harvested from \npatients with BPH (n=3), were isolated, cultured, and stimulated with \nOxLDL (20 \u00b5M or 100 \u00b5M, simulating an atherogenic state) or vehi -\ncle for 24h and 48h.\nOxLDL induced cell proliferation, as assessed by BrdU incorporation \nand Ki67 immunocytochemistry, mainly at lower concentrations and \nin a time-dependent manner (p<0.001 vs. vehicle). OxLDL-treated \ncells also displayed a myofibroblastic phenotype with high metabolic \nactivity, characterized by an increase of cytoplasmic granules, dilat -\ned endoplasmic reticulum, and the presence of prominent nucleoli, \nas evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Further -\nmore, the release and characterization of Extracellular Vesicles \n(EVs) were determined in supernatants, which were isolated by \nultracentrifugation steps and observed by TEM using negative stain -\ning. BPH-derived stromal cells showed a very low frequency of se -\ncreted EVs, with OxLDL inducing a 10-fold increase, especially in a \nfraction of 15-20nm (p<0.001). At ultrastructural level, these vesicles \nexhibited an artificial concave shape appearance, compatible with \nexosomes. Taken together, these findings indicate that OxLDL pro -\nmotes cell proliferation, stimulation, and EVs release in BPH stromal \ncells, pointing OxLDL as a strong pathogenic factor in atherogenic \ncontexts supporting uncontrolled prostatic growth.\n74.

Among the content that \ncould be found in OMVs, there are genes associated with antimi -\ncrobial resistance. In this study we proposed to characterize the \nOMVs from two extensively resistant clones with epidemic behav -\nior circulating in Argentina, E. coli  ST131 (SM5), and P. aeuriginosa  \nST2867 (PAE981). In addition, we looked for the presence of genes \nassociated with antimicrobial resistance in these vesicles. To char -\nacterize OMVs, we used an isolation method that was based on the \nInternational Society for Extracellular Vesicles guidelines. This pro -\ncedure recommends:  (i) The source of OMVs must be quantitatively \ndefined, for that reason we adjusted the initial culture of bacteria \nto OD600 ~ 0.05,  (ii) Total quantification of OMVs, in this case we \nquantified the proteins with the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit,  (iii) \nA technique that provides images of individual electric vesicles at \nhigh resolution, for this we used transmission electron microscopy \n(TEM), and (iv) It is needed to have evidence of individual particle \nanalysis technique that estimate biophysical characteristics of EVs, \nfor this we used nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Finally, by \nPCR assay we looked for genes associated with antimicrobial resis -\ntance and confirm the result by PCR and sequencing. NTA results \nshowed a typical distribution of peaks for OMVs with a major peak \nbetween 100\u2013300 nm in diameter . These results were confirmed \nthrough TEM images, where they showed a heterogeneous distri -\nbution and particles of similar size to those found in NTA . PCR and \nsequencing assays allowed us to detect in the OMVs from E. coli  \nST131 SM5 the  blaCTX-M-15 gene, and from P. aeruginosa ST2867 the \nblaVIM-2 gene. The present study shows an efficient isolation method \nin different bacterial genera that allows the physical characterization \nand detection of genes associated with antimicrobial resistance by PCR in OMV.\n75.

Current proto -\ncols derive \u03b2 cells from human pluripotent stem cells by mimicking \ncell signaling events that occur during fetal development and manip -\nulate signaling pathways known to perform key and stage-specific \nfunctions during pancreas growth and differentiation. Thus, gaining \ninsights into the mechanisms by which novel pathways control this \nprocess might significantly impact this field of research. Previous \nstudies have shown that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling \npathway plays an important role in the generation of an appropriate \nnumber of \u03b2 cells in adults, although the underlying molecular mech -\nanisms still remain largely unexplored. We have previously reported \nthe construction of genomic cis regulatory maps in human pancre -\natic islets and in the human embryonic pancreas based on ChIP-\nseq and RNA-seq experiments.  Our analyses led to the discovery \nthat TEAD and YAP are important gene regulators in the embry -\nonic pancreas, in charge of maintaining the pancreatic multipotent \nprogenitor cell phenotype. Further analysis shows that a subset of \nthe genes that are highly expressed in multipotent progenitor cells \n(MPCs) could be downregulated upon activation of the GR pathway. \nWe used mouse pancreatic explants to assess the transcriptomic \neffects of GC treatment during early development, finding that en -\ndocrine fate-related genes were downregulated. We also profiled by \nscRNA-seq the transcriptional changes induced by GC treatment \nof MPCs derived in vitro from hiPS cells.

(128) MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN \n2 (MRP2) INTERNALIZATION IS DIFFERENTIALLY MOD -\nULATED BY PI3K AND MEK-ERK PROTEINS IN ACUTE \nTUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA (TNF)-INDUCED \nCHOLESTASIS\nCiriaci N1, Andermatten RB1, Schuck VS1, Taborda D1, Ruiz \nML, S\u00e1nchez Pozzi EJ1. \n1Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eda Experimental. IFISE-CONICET. Facul -\ntad de Ciencias Bioqu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas, Universidad \nNacional de Rosario.\nBackground: TNF induces internalization of Mrp2. At least, two \npathways are involved: one includes NADPH oxidase, reactive oxy -\ngen species and MEK-ERK kinases ( Biochem Pharmacol 164:311, \n2019 ) and the other, PI3K-Akt. The aim of this study is to discern \nwhether these pathways are involved in the initial endocytic inter -\nnalization of Mrp2 or in the blockage of its subsequent reinsertion \ntoward the canalicular membrane, using the isolated perfused rat \nliver model (IPRL).MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 202068\nMethod: In IPRL, TNF was administered by an intraportal injection \n(120 pg/100 g b.w.). The roles of PI3K and ERK were evaluated \nadding their inhibitors wortmannin (W, 200 nM) or PD980589  (PD, 4 \n\u00b5M) to the reservoir 10 min before TNF. Bile was collected over 30 \nmin and bile flow was measured gravimetrically. To evaluate Mrp2 \ntransport activity, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (0.5 mmol/L) was \nadded to the perfusate. Then dinitrophenyl glutathione (DNPG) bili -\nary secretion was determined spectrophotometrically. Finally, Mrp2 \nlocalization was analysed by immunofluorescence and confocal mi -\ncroscopy.\nResults: (% of control\u00b1SE; n=3). Bile flow was decreased by TNF \n(to about 80% of control values within 20 min) and it did not re -\ncover throughout the perfusion period. This impairment of bile flow \nwas restored by inhibitors: PD tended to protect from the beginning \nwhereas W protected from 15 min onwards, suggesting different \nprotection mechanisms. TNF-induced decrease of cumulative bili -\nary DNPG excretion (71\u00b16a) was countered by W (100\u00b13b) and PD \n(109\u00b12b). Both inhibitors prevented Mrp2 delocalization induced by \nTNF in confocal images. ap < 0.05 vs. Control; bp < 0.05 vs. TNF.\nConclusion: Mrp2 internalization induced by TNF was prevented \nby W and PD. As W does not protect from the initial bile flow decay \ninduced by TNF, PI3K is probably not implied in the initial transporter \ndesinsertion but in preventing spontaneous reinsertion of the cana -\nlicular carrier, previously endocytosed via MEK-ERK.\n77. (139) OXIDATIVE STRESS IS INVOLVED IN THE IMPAIR -\nMENT OF MRP2 ACTIVITY INDUCED BY ESTRADIOL \n17\u00df-D-GLUCURONIDE IN RAT HEPATOCYTES.\nSalas G1, Medeot AC1, Schuck VS1, Miszczuk G1, Anderma -\ntten RB1, Ciriaci N1, Razori V1, Sanchez Pozzi EJ1, Roma \nMG1, Basiglio CL1, Crocenzi FA 1\n1 Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eda Experimental, Facultad de Ciencias \nBioqu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas, Universidad Nacional de Ro -\nsario.\nEstradiol 17\u03b2-d-glucuronide (E17G) is an endogenous metabolite \nof estradiol which mediates the intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnan -\ncy. E17G impairs canalicular secretion via several kinase-mediat -\ned signaling pathways which leads to endocytosis and intracellular \nretention of canalicular transporters, contributing the MEK-ERK1/2 \npathway to the second process. Oxidative stress has also been \nshown to trigger these effects on canalicular transporters. We stud -\nied the possible role of oxidative stress in E17G-induced impairment \nof Mrp2 function by assessing the canalicular vacuolar accumulation \n(cVA) of glutathione-S-methylfluorescein (GS-MF) in rat hepatocyte \ncouplets (RHC). The possible E17G-induced increase in intracellu -\nlar reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed fluorometrically \nin primary cultured rat hepatocytes (PCH) by the 2?,7?-dichloro -\nfluorescin-diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay. A probable role of ROS in \nE17G-induced Mrp2 function impairment was evaluated by preincu -\nbating RHC for 15 min with the antioxidants vitamin C (VitC), manni -\ntol (Man), N,N\u2019-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPPD), and also with \napocynin (Apo), a specific inhibitor of the ROS-producing enzyme \nNADPH oxidase (NOX), prior to a 20-min exposure to E17G; a po -\ntential role of MEK-ERK1/2 pathway was assessed by its inhibition \nwith the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (PD). E17G increased intracellular \nROS by 43\u00b19 %[p<0.05 vs control (C)] after 15 min in PCH and \nApo completely prevented this effect. E17G reduced the cVA of GS-\nMF with respect to C by 45\u00b12%(p<0.05). This was prevented by \nthe antioxidants (VitC: 61\u00b15%, Man: 71\u00b17%, DPPD: 69\u00b16%, p<0.05 \nvs E17G and C) and by Apo (72\u00b15%, p<0.05 vs E17G and C); PD \nprevented E17G-induced effect on cVA of GS-MF similarly to Apo \nand showed no additive effects when added together, suggesting \nthat they share the same pathway. These results propose a role of \nNOX-generated ROS in the E17G-induced impairment of Mrp2 ac -\ntivity in rat hepatocytes via the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway.\n78. (142) MEK / ERK ARE INVOLVED IN THE DISINSERSION \nOF THE MRP2 TRANSPORTER IN CHOLESTASIS IN -\nDUCED BY IL-BETA.\nSchuck VS1, Andermatten RB1, Ciraci N1, Salas G1, Medeot \nAC1, Barosso IR1, Sanchez Pozzi E1.\n1. Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eda Experimental, Facultad de Ciencias Bioqu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas, Universidad Nacional de Ro -\nsario.\nInflammatory cytokines produce alterations in the location and func -\ntion of canalicular transporters and could mediate the biliary secreto -\nry failure observed in inflammatory-associated pathologies such as \nsepsis. This action of cytokines is mediated by activation of signaling \nproteins. Our aim was to study which signaling proteins are involved \nin the cholestasis model induced by one of these cytokines, IL-1 \u03b2, \nand to analyze the location of the Mrp2 transporter using confocal \nimage analysis. In particular, we analyze the role of MEK / ERK pro -\nteins using the isolated rat hepatocyte couplet (IRHC) model.\nMethodology : IRHCs were pre-incubated for 15 minutes with the \nMEK1 / 2 inhibitor, PD980589 (PD 5 \u00b5M), followed by incubation with \nIL-1\u03b2 (10 ng / ml, 20 minutes). Then, they were exposed to  chloro -\nmethylfluorescein diacetate (2.5 \u00b5M, 15 min) converted intracellu -\nlarly into glutathione methylfluorescein (GMF), an Mrp2 substrate. \nFinally, Mrp2 activity was estimated by the percentage of IRHC that \naccumulated GMF in the canalicular vesicle (cVA). At the same time , \nactivation of the MEK / ERK pathway was estimated in isolated he -\npatocytes treated with IL1 \u03b2 by evaluating ERK phosphorylation by \nWestern Blot. To confirm whether IL-1 \u03b2 produces internalization  of \nMrp2, IRHCs treated with IL-1 \u03b2 were studied by immunostaining fol -\nlowed by confocal microscopy.\nResults:  (% of control \u00b1 SE): IL-1 \u03b2 significantly reduced Mrp2 activ -\nity (cVA: IL-1 \u03b2 = 51 \u00b1 4% a). This was prevented by PD (97 \u00b1 2% b). \nTreatment with IL1 \u03b2 caused an increase in phosphorylated levels of \nERK after 20 min (IL: 210 \u00b1 25% a). a different from control, b differ -\nent from IL. P <0.05. (n = 3). Confocal images confirmed that Mrp2 \nassociated-fluorescence was internalized in IL-1\u03b2-treated IRHCs.\nConclusion:  The cytokine IL-1 \u03b2 produces a reduction in Mrp2 func -\ntion, associated with internalization of the transporter, mediated in \npart by the activation of the MEK1 / 2 and ERK1 / 2 proteins.\n79. (163) ROLE OF P38 MITOGEN ACTIVATED PROTEIN \nKINASE (MAPK) IN TAUROLITHOCHOLATE (TLC)-IN -\nDUCED IMPAIRMENT OF MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-AS -\nSOCIATED PROTEIN 2 (MRP2) ACTIVITY\nAndermatten RB1, Ciriaci N1, Schuck VS1, Razori MV1, Baros -\nso IR1, S\u00e1nchez Pozzi EJ1.\n1Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eda Experimental, Facultad de Ciencias \nBioqu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas, Universidad Nacional de Ro -\nsario\nTLC causes cholestasis inducing internalization of canalicular trans -\nporters, Mrp2 among them. In part, this effect is due to a sequential \nactivation of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), adenylyl \ncyclase, PKA and PI3K, which blocks the spontaneous reinsertion \nof Mrp2 but does not affect its initial internalization induced by TLC. \nRecently, we found that p38 MAPK is also implicated in the actions \nof TLC on Mrp2 activity independently of S1PR2. Our aim was to \nevaluate the role of p38 in Mrp2 internalization using the isolated \nperfused rat liver model (IPRL).\nMethodology:  In IPRL, TLC (4.5 \u03bcmol/liver) was injected in the \nportal vein. SB203580, p38 inhibitor (SB, 500 nM), was added to \nreservoir 10 min before TLC. Finally, biliary flow and dinitrophe -\nnyl-glutathione (DNPG) excretion were determined. Isolated rat he -\npatocytes were pretreated with S1PR2 [JTE-013 (JTE 10 \u00b5M)] and \nPI3K [wortmannin (W 100 nM)] inhibitors and exposed to TLC (2.5 \n\u00b5M). Then, cells were lysed and p38 phosphorylation was analyzed \nby western blot. \nResults: (% of control \u00b1 SEM; n=3). In IPRL, TLC decreased bile flow \nto a minimum at min 10 post injection (3.5\u00b10.5a) partially recovering \nat min 30 (19.0\u00b13.0a). Similarly, DNPG excretion had a minimum at \nmin 10 (2.1\u00b10.3a) and partially recovered at min 30 (10.6\u00b11.2a). SB \ndid not prevent the initial decays in bile flow (11.0\u00b12.0a) and DNPG \nexcretion (7.2\u00b12.2a) but significantly improves recovery at min 30 \n(bile flow: 40.6\u00b15.4a,b; DNPG exc.: 25.0\u00b15.9a,b). Activation of p38 in -\nduced by TLC (227\u00b126a) decreased by W (129\u00b17b), whereas, JTE \ndid not affect it (299\u00b145a). ap<0.05 vs control, bp<0.05 vs TLC. \nConclusion : p38 MAPK mediates TLC-induced cholestasis block -\ning the spontaneous retargeting of disinserted Mrp2 to the cana -\nlicular membrane. Though p38 is not downstream of S1PR2, it is ABSTRACTS69\ndownstream of PI3K, suggesting that in TLC cholestasis, two differ -\nent PI3K are involved, one in the pathway initiated in S1PR2 and the \nother upstream of p38.\n80. (241) TAUROURSODESOXICOLATE (TUDC) PRE -\nVENTS THE CHOLESTATIC EFFECTS OF ESTRADIOL \n17\u00df-D-GLUCURONIDE (E17G) VIA ACTIVATION OF C a2+/\nCALMODULIN PROTEIN KINASE II (CaMKII) .\nMedeot AC1, Boaglio AC1, Razori MV1, Salas G1, Schuck VS1, \nCrocenzi FA1, Roma MG1.\n1Intituto de Fisiolog\u00eda Experimental, Facultad de Ciencias \nBioqu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas, Universidad Nacional de Ro -\nsario.\nE17G, the main etiologic agent of pregnancy-induced cholestasis, \ntriggers bile flow drop by inducing endocytosis and intracellular \nretention of the canalicular transporters involved in bile secretion \nMrp2 and Bsep, via activation of cPKC and PI3K, respectively. We \nshowed that TUDC, the active metabolite of ursodeoxycholic acid \n(the most effective drug used to treat this condition), counteracts \nall these pathomechanisms. However, the signaling mediators in -\nvolved in this protection remains unknown. Since TUDC increas -\nes cytosolic Ca2+ and, by doing so, promotes vesicular exocytosis \nunder cholestatic conditions, we tested in rat hepatocyte couplets \n(RHC) whether Ca2+ and its downstream effector CaMKII mediate \nTUDC protective effects. E17G (200 \u00b5M, 20 min) decreased by \n56\u00b11 % and 60\u00b12 % (p<0.05) the % of RHC accumulating apically \nthe fluorescent Bsep and Mrp2 substrates cholyl-lysilfluorecein and \nGSH-S-methylflourescein, respectively, as assessed by inverted flu -\norescence microscopy. Pretreatment with TUDC (100 \u00b5M, 15 min) \nfully prevented these alterations. Beneficial effects of TUDC were \nfully blocked by the Ca2+ sequestering agent BAPTA (20 \u00b5M) and by \nthe CaMKII inhibitor KN62 (10 \u00b5M). E17G-induced endocytosis of \nMrp2, assessed by immunostaining followed by confocal microsco -\npy and image analysis, was significantly prevented by TUDCA, and \nthis was fully halted by BAPTA and KN62. Western blot analysis re -\nvealed that TUDC impeded the translocation of the main cPKC iso -\nform, PKC- a, to plasma membrane and prevented phosphorylation \nof Akt, two events indicative of activation of these pro-cholestatic \nsignaling molecules, and that these activations were fully blocked by \nBAPTA and KN62. We conclude that TUDC-induced preservation of \nBsep and Mrp2 function and location in E17G-induced cholestasis \ninvolves intracellular Ca2+ elevations and further CaMKII activation, \nand that CaMKII crosstalks with the pro-cholestatic signaling path -\nways cPKC and PI3K/Akt to impede their activation.\n81.

They were anesthetized with ether, and after \nperforming abdominal laparotomy, physiological solution was inject -\ned into the subserosal space of the anterior gastric face (union of \nthe gastric body with the antrum). + 0.5 mg 70% AC. The laparotomy \nwas closed. Water was administered ad libitum and they were also \nfed daily, Group A: for 5 days, Group B: for 21 days. After that time, \nafter anesthesia, the stomach was removed and dissected starting \nfrom the greater curvature, quantifying by planimetry the percentage \nof the macroscopic zone of damage. Sections were made for inclu -\nsion in paraffin, and staining with Haematoxylin and Eosin, digested \nPAS and Alcian Blue at pH 2.50. \nResults:  Group A : the percentage of macroscopic lesioned area is 4-7 mm \u00b1 3mm. Group B : No macroscopic lesion is observed. Histol -\nogy: Group A : lymphocytic inflammatory process with reactive vas -\ncular proliferation was identified in the submucosa. In the overlying \noxyntic (OX) MG, cells with peripheral displacement of the nuclei, \nwith clear, broad cytoplasm, positive with digested PAS staining, \nand few parietal cells of preserved morphology were observed. No \nglandular atrophy or deformity of the glandular lumens were found. \nGroup B : There is an area of submucosal thickening due to fibro -\nsis, with an overlying area of partially atrophic mucosa, distended \nglands, irregularly shaped, lined by high epithelium, not OX, positive \nwith digested PAS staining, constituting a pyloric type metaplasic \nprocess (MTP) in the gastric body. \nConclusions:  It is proposed that the stimulation of cellular repair \nmechanisms on the main cells of the gastric body, generated meta -\nplasic cells of the pyloric type (MTP), configuring a new cell lineage \nin the gastric body.\n82.

Universidad \nde Buenos Aires\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a pathology with epidem -\nic proportions. It characterizes by the accumulation of triglycerides in \nhepatocytes (steatosis), which could generate hepatic inflammation. \nFatty acid accumulation is triggered by an excessive arrival of these \nfrom adipose tissue, or a dysregulation between de novo  lipogene -\nsis and lipid catabolism. SPARC is a widely expressed protein with \npleiotropic role. We previously demonstrated that SPARC absence \nincreased hepatic steatosis in a murine diet-induced obesity model. \nThe aim this study was to evaluate the role of SPARC in hepatic lipid \ndeposition and lipogenesis.\nPrimary hepatocyte cultures from SPARC+/+ and SPARC-/- mice or \nSPARC knockdown HepG2 cells were used to study SPARC effect \non lipid droplets and expression of lipogenic genes in free fatty acids \n(FFA) presence. Hepatocyte survival was assessed by AO/EB stain -\ning and MTT. De novo  triglyceride synthesis was evaluated in he -\npatocytes. Immunofluorescence for SREBP1 in hepatocyte was per -\nformed. In hepatic sections of SPARC+/+ and SPARC-/- mice SREBP1 \nprotein localization was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.\nSPARC-/- hepatocytes and SPARC knockdown HepG2 cells accu -\nmulated higher amounts of lipids in FFA presence. It was demon -\nstrated that the absence of SPARC stimulates de novo  triglyceride \nsynthesis in hepatocytes. In turn, there is an increase in the expres -\nsion of genes related to lipid metabolism. In primary hepatocyte \ncultures it was observed that genes involved in lipid metabolism, \ntransport and lipogenesis were overexpressed in SPARC absence. \nSrebp1c expression, a key transcription factor in lipogenesis, was \nincreased. Immunofluorescence for SREBP1c showed that, in \nSPARC absence, this transcription factor is located at the nucleus, \nwhile in SPARC+/+ hepatocytes it has a cytoplasmic and perinuclear \nlocalization.\nOur results suggest a key role of SPARC in hepatic lipid deposition \nand metabolism that could modulate hepatic steatosis development.\n83.

Liver inflammation is critical in disease pro -\ngression, but the cellular infiltrate composition and the role of each \nlymphocyte population are still up for debate. \nOur aim was to characterize the inflammatory infiltrate present in the \nliver microenvironment both in children and adult MAFLD patients \nand to evaluate it according to damage severity. \nTwenty-six MAFLD pediatric patients [median age: 11.5 years (range \n4-17)] and 35 adult patients [ median age: 49 years (range 28-72)] \nwere enrolled . Histological parameters as well as localization and \nfrequency of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CD8+), T helper Lympho -\ncytes (CD4+), Regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg, Foxp3+) and Th17 \n(IL-17A+) were evaluated on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver \nbiopsies by staining and immunohistochemistry, respectively.  \nIn portal/periportal (P/P) tracts, there was a similar proportion of \nCD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes, while CD8+ lymphocytes predomi -\nnated in the intralobular area. IL-17A+ lymphocytes seemed to be \nnearly exclusive of P/P area. Age-groups comparison demonstrat -\ned higher P/P Foxp3+ ( p=0.006, M-W test) and intralobular CD8+, \nCD4+ and Foxp3+ lymphocyte counts ( p=0.025, p=0.0004 and \np=0.013, respectively, M-W test), but lower P/P IL-17A+/Foxp3+ cell \nratio ( p=0.041 M-W test) in adults. Severe inflammation was asso -\nciated with higher intralobular Foxp3+ lymphocytes ( p=0.026 M-W \ntest) in children, and lower P/P Foxp3+ and higher IL-17A+ lympho -\ncytes in adults. All cases with fibrosis \u22652 displayed P/P low Foxp3+ \nand high IL-17A+ lymphocyte counts. Pediatric cases with worse \nsteatosis showed high P/P CD4+ ( p=0.023, t test) and intralobular \nCD8+ ( p=0.027M-W test) and CD4+ cells ( p=0.012M-W test).  \nIn MAFLD cases, the lymphocyte liver infiltrate composition differs \nbetween children and adults.

Sequence vari -\nants (mainly nonsense or substitutions in its Zinc finger domains) \nlead to distinctive phenotypes. The lack of KLF1 can lead to an in -\nefficient \u03b2-globin cluster switch, which can increase the HbF and \nHbA2 fractions. In consequence, variants mapping in this gene can \nalter the clinical course of \u03b2-thalassemia.\nObjectives:  Perform structural predictive analyses of the missense \nvariants detected in a group of Argentinean patients and carry out \nanalyses to predict their impact as regulatory targets.\nPatients and methods: The DNA from 3 individuals with moderately \nincreased levels of HbA2 and 20 patients with thalassemia interme -\ndia or severe \u03b2-thalassemia carriers was obtained and KLF1 was \namplified by PCR and sequenced by the Sanger method. Since \nKLF1 has not been crystallized, predictive models were built with \nRaptorX contact prediction, their potential as regulatory sites was \nanalyzed with RegulomeDB and their impact on the splicing of the \nmRNA with ESEfinder.\nResults: Only 3 previously described missense variants with no \nor minor functional consequences were detected: rs112631212, \nrs2072597 and rs2072596. The first two could affect the structure \nlocally, disrupting \u03b1-helixes. However, none affect the Zinc Finger domains. The second variant scored 0.3145 (2a category) in Regu -\nlomeDB 2.0. The latter 2 affect exonic splicing enhancers.\nDiscussion: The structural analysis of the variants matches the lack \nof effect described. It is unlikely that they could affect the default \nsplicing of  the KLF1 mRNA, since these SNPs map far from the \nexon-exon junctions. rs2072597 was the most frequent variant \n(11/46 alleles) and it could impact its role as a regulatory target; the \nZFX transcription factor motif is disrupted and ChIP assays have \ndemonstrated that this factor interacts with this region in K562 cells. \nAlthough this effect may not inhibit KLF1 expression, it could induce \nchanges in its expression levels.\n85.

The pathogenic prediction of most \nof the variants was reinforced after analysis, and surprisingly in one \ncase diminished the predictive deleterious effect.\nOn the other hand, knock down phenotype rescue assay in zebraf -\nish is underway to accomplish in-vivo validation.\nPreliminary results in zebrafish confirmed the pathogenicity of one \nnovel variant in MYO6 gene which affected the hair cell function and \nhence, auditory system physiology.\nThis study shows that our algorithm is successful for deafness ge -\nnetic diagnosis. Comprehensive analysis is crucial to strengthen the \npathogenicity effect of variants and discard some of them. These \nfindings highlight the importance of genetic studies followed by in \nsilico and in vivo validation to better understand the genetic basis of \nhereditary hearing loss.\n86.

(CONICET)\u2013 Uni -\nversidad de Buenos Aires (UBA).\nObjective\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by insulin re -\nsistance (RI) which can influence the content of mitochondrial DNA \n(mtDNA). Our objective was to evaluate the content of mtDNA in \nwomen with PCOS compared with control women and the relation \nwith metabolic parameters.\nMaterials and methods:\nWe studied fifty women with PCOS and thirty-four control women \naged 17 to 45 years. The determination of the number of copies of \nmtDNA was carried out in peripheral blood leukocytes by Quantita -\ntive real-time PCR. The results were calculated using the compara -\ntive-cycle threshold (\u0394\u0394Ctq) method. Statistical analysis were car -\nried out by Student\u2019s t-test, correlation and linear regressions with a \nsignificance level of 0.05 (SPSS 25).\nResults:\nCompared to controls, PCOS patients have higher weight, body \nmass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), also higher levels of \nTG, LDL, total cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose and lower levels \nof HDL cholesterol. By linear regression we observed that mtDNA \nwas significantly lower in the presence of PCOS (135.57 \u00b1 81.34 \nvs 190.37 \u00b1 135.19; p = 0.023). A significant negative correlation \nwas observed between the mtDNA content and telomere length (p \n= 0.034). Within PCOS patients, women with insulin resistance ac -\ncording to a HOMA index \u2265 2.5 have a lower mtDNA content com -\npared to PCOS women with HOMA <2.5 (169.89 \u00b1 105.3 vs 116.45 \n\u00b1 53.2; p = 0.03). \nConclusion:\nA decrease in mtDNA content occurs in the presence of PCOS and \nRI, which can be explained by the damage to mitochondrial DNA \n(mtDNA), proteins and lipids due to the oxidative stress associated \nwith PCOS. More studies are required to determine the scope of the \nresults obtained.\n87. (231) MYD88 AND CXCR4 MUTATIONS IN PATIENTS \nWITH WALDENSTR\u00d6M MACROGLOBULINEMIA AND \nIGM-MGUS\nCarmen Stanganelli (Divisi\u00f3n Patolog\u00eda Molecular, IIHEMA, \nAcademia Nacional de Medicina (ANM)),  Juana Cabrera \n(Divisi\u00f3n Patolog\u00eda Molecular, IIHEMA, Academia Nacional \nde Medicina (ANM)),  Camila Galvano (Laboratorio de Gen\u00e9 -\ntica de Neoplasias Linfoides, IMEX, CONICET-ANM),  Irma  \nSlavutsky (Laboratorio de Gen\u00e9tica de Neoplasias Linfoides, \nIMEX, CONICET-ANM)\nWaldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia (WM) is a lymphoplasmacytic lym -\nphoma with involvement of the bone marrow (BM) and the presence \nof a monoclonal IgM gammopathy. It is usually preceded by an IgM \nmonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). WM \nand IgM-MGUS are associated to MYD88  gene mutations, particu -\nlarly MYD88L265, and CXCR4  gene mutations,  being  CXCR4S338X the \nmost common variant. These mutations are of importance in diag -\nnosis, treatment selection and response evaluation. We have ana -\nlyzed MYD88  and CXCR4  mutations in patients with WM and IgM-\nMGUS in order to established their frequency and distribution in our \ncohort. BM or peripheral blood genomic DNA was used; ASO-PCR \nand bidirectional Sanger sequencing were performed. The study was \napproved by the local Ethic Committee; all individuals provided their \ninformed consent. Thirty-one patients with WM: 22 at diagnosis, 4 in \nrelapse, 5 during post treatment control (13 males; mean age 67.5 \nyears) and 12 with IgM-MGUS (5 males; mean age 76.9 years) were \nevaluated. The activating mutation MYD88L265P was found in 81.8% \nWM patients at diagnosis, 100% at relapse, 0% in post treatment \ncontrol and in 41.6% IgM-MGUS. CXCR4  mutations were found \nin 2/22 (9%) cases with WM: one patient showed CXCR4S338 C>G \ntransversion at nucleotide 1013 and the other CXCR4R334X C>T, \nc.1000C<T variant, both resulting in the generation of a stop codon. \nAnalysis of data showed the following distribution: MYD88MUT/CX-\nCR4WT (85.7% cases), MYD88MUT/CXCR4MUT  (9.5%) and MYD88WT/\nCXCR4WT (4.8%). No CXCR4  mutations in the IgM-MGUS patients were found. Our cohort showed MYD88  positivity within reported \nvalues, instead we found a low frequency of CXCR4  mutations. Al -\nthough ASO-PCR is highly sensitive, it is advisable to analyze BM \nsamples in relapse evaluation. To our knowledge, this is the first \nanalysis of both mutations in patients with WM and IgM-MGUS from \nour country, being of significance in the way of a personalized med -\nicine.\n88.

Secci\u00f3n Nutrici\u00f3n.\nObjectives: To analyze the absolute telomere length (LTa) in indi -\nviduals with altered fasting glucose levels compared to individuals \nwith normal fasting glucose levels. Also, we performed a prospec -\ntive controlled study to evaluate the variation in LTa in patients with \ndecompensated type 2 Diabetes (T2D) before and after a treatment \nmetabolic compensation.\nMaterials and Methods: The study included 246 individuals of both \ngenders, which were divided according to normal fasting glucose \nlevels <110 mg/dl (NFG group) and alterated fasting glucose lev -\nels \u2265110 mg/dl (AFG group). In addition, they were divided by age \ngroups into: under 25 years (<25Y), between 25 and 50 years (25-\n50Y) and over 50 years (>50Y). A subgroup of 30 patients with newly \ndiagnosed T2D was studied, at the beginning (T0), and at 6 months \n(T6) of a pharmacological treatment and hygienic-dietary measures. \nBiochemical and clinical variables were analyzed for all the individ -\nuals. The LTa were determined by qPCR. Statistical analyzes were \nperformed with GraphPad Prism and SPSS.\nResults: LTa significantly correlated with age (r=-0.21, p=0.009) \nand the increase in blood glucose ranges (r=-0.32, p<0.001). \nThe NFG group showed a significantly higher LTa than the AFG \ngroup (p<0.001), also when comparing the same age group: <25Y \n(p=0.013); 25-50Y (p=0.002) and> 50Y (p=0.002).\nThe T2D subgroup showed a negative association between the vari -\nation in LTa and age (r=-0.12, p=0.02) after 6 months of treatment. \nThe most relevant result was the positive and significant association \nfound between the variation of LTa and the treatment of dose of \nMetformin (r=0.003, p=0.007). \nConclusion: Glycemic control could prevent accelerated telomere \nshortening and reduce the risk of developing age-related diseas -\nes. The increase in LTa after treatment in T2D was associated with \nyounger individuals and the use of higher doses of Metformin. LTa \ncan be an effective marker for early intervention in hyperglycemia.\n89. (274) GENETIC VARIANTS OF CYP2E1 AND ITS RELA -\nTIONSHIP WITH PORPHYRIA CUTANEA TARDA DEVEL -\nOPMENT\nDiego Miguel Gordillo (CIPYP) , Lubna Abou Assali (CIPYP) , \nLaura Sabina Varela (CIPYP) , Gabriela Nora Cerbino (CI-\nPYP),  Victoria Estela Parera (CIPYP) , Mar\u00eda Victoria  Rosse -\ntti (CIPYP) , Ana Mar\u00eda Buzaleh (CIPYP-FCEN-UBA)\nPorphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT) is due to a partial deficiency in uro -\nporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D); there are two main types: \nhereditary (H-PCT) or acquired (A-PCT). The cytochrome variants \nP-450, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 alter their drug metabolizing capacity \ngenerating metabolites that can inhibit URO-D, increasing suscepti -\nbility to trigger Porphyria. The product of the CYP2E1 variant metab -\nolizes ethanol, known as a porphyrinogenic agent. The objective was \nto investigate the role of CYP2E1*5B (NG_008383.1:g.3979C>T; \nrs2031920) and CYP2E1*7B (NG_008383.1:g.4963G>T; MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 202072\nrs6413420) variants in PCT development. H-PCT (30), A-PCT (31) \nand control (33) groups were genotyped by RFLP-PCR and se -\nquenced when the band pattern was unclear. When we analized \nCYP2E1*5B, the frequencies of the reference homozygote were \nsimilar to those of the heterozygote, the alternative homozygote \nwere not present and C allele was the most common. There was no \nsignificant risk association between this variant and PCT. Studying \nCYP2E1*7B, the reference homozygotes genotypes were more fre -\nquent than heterozygotes and both have higher frequencies than al -\nternative homozygotes; the frequency of G/T was significantly high -\ner in H-PCT individuals compared to A-PCT (p=0.045), being the \nreference allele the most frequent. Comparing H-PCT vs A-PCT, G/T \nvs G/G gave a significant risk association (OR=4.11; 1.01<CI<17.2; \np=0.044), being T allele for these same groups of not significant \nrisk. The study of risk haplotypes for CYP2E1*5B/*7B in both types \nof PCT vs control gave T-T (non-significant differences). Since both \nvariants are associated with an increase in transcriptional activity \nof CYP2E1 gene, it is suggested that they could be a risk factor to \ntrigger PCT. These studies are valuable for personalized medical \nadvice in order to prevent carriers from being exposed to porphy -\nrinogenic agents.\n90.

Since reporting variants \nwithout full knowledge of their pathogenicity represents a risk for \npatients and their family group, establishment of functional studies \nfor them is of utmost importance for Familial Hypercholesterolemia \ndiagnosis. Somatic genome editing, using CRISPR-Cas9 technol -\nogy, has a tremendous potential for human gene therapy of lipid \ndisorders. \nObjective: we aimed at designing an in silico  strategy for generating \na knockout cell line in LDLR  gene, using a CRISPR-Cas9 system, to \nset the basis for a future knock-in stage for variants whose functional \npathogenicity must be demonstrated.\nMaterial and Methods: Guide crRNAs for LDLR  gene were designed \nusing the Chop-Chop and CRISPOR platforms. We investigated the \nstructure of LDLR  gene and protein by analysing their functional \ndomains using bioinformatics tools like ELM and SMART. The effi -\nciency scores were calculated by Doench JG, et al (2016) and More -\nno-Mateos M, et al (2015).\nResults: We obtained a battery of 6 crRNAs which were ranked by \ntheir genomic position, efficiency, number and localization of off tar -\ngets and frameshift frequency. Although several crRNAs were ob -\ntained, we selected those ones targeted at exons 1 and 2 of the \nLDLR  gene in order to have higher performance in the knockout pro -\ncess. The efficiency score ranged from 46 to 66%, with a maximum \nof 7 off targets with 3 missmatches. The off targets did not interact or \nparticipate in the LDLR gene metabolic pathway. \nConclusion: Our strategy provides a battery of 6 crRNAs, targeted \nat exon 1 and 2 of the LDLR  gene affecting the translation start and \nligand binding domain, respectively. Given these results, we will try \nto prove these crRNAs in HepG-2 cell line in order to resemble the in \nvivo lipid metabolism to set the basis for functional categorization of \nLDLR  gene variants associated with Familial Hypercholesterolemia.\n91.

To date, two hundred twenty-seven variations of \nthe TG gene have been identified in humans. Thyroid dyshormono -\ngenesis due to TG gene mutations have an estimated incidence of \napproximately 1 in 100,000 newborns. The clinical spectrum ranges \nfrom euthyroid to mild or severe hypothyroidism. Splicing mutations \nrepresent a major cause of human disease, between 15\u201350% of \nall human disease. Variants at the level of the splice site lminate \nin important defects at the level of the pre-mRNA splicing process. \nThe splicing process is quite complex whose molecular bases and \ninteractions with underlying elements are still not entirely clear, re -\nsulting as we show in the present work, a rare phenotype involving \nmechanisms of such processing of those pre-RNAS from a variant \nfounded for our group in a hypothyroid patient.Thepurpose of the \npresent studywas to identifyand characterizenew variants in the TG \ngene. We report an Argentine patient with congenital hypothyroid -\nism, enlarged thyroid gland and low levels of serum TG. Sequencing \nof DNA, expression of chimeric minigenes as well as bioinformatics \nanalysis were performed.\nDNA sequencing identified the presence of compound heterozy -\ngous variant in the TG gene: the maternal mutation consists of a \nc.3001+5G>A, whereas the paternal mutation consists of p.R296*.\nMinigen analysis of the variant c.3001+5G>A performed in HeLa, \nCV1 and Hek93T cell lines, shows a total miss of transcript expres -\nsion. So, in order to validate that the lack of expressionwas caused \nby such variation, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on \nthe mutated clone,who had a pSPL3 vector change, to give rise \nto a wild-type clone c.3001+5G and to indorsing that the mutation \nc.3001+5G>A is the cause of the total lack of expression.

Multiple missense mutations in POU1F1 have been \nreported to cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency and/or iso -\nlated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD). Alternative splicing in this \ngene results in two isoforms: the predominant transcriptional activa -\ntor alpha and the minor isoform beta that acts as a transcriptional re -ABSTRACTS73\npressor. The POU1F1 beta isoform transcript is created by utilization \nof an upstream splice acceptor sequence in exon 2 which results in \na protein with insertion of 26 amino acids that encode an ETS1 bind -\ning domain inserted in the transactivation domain. All the reported \nmutations are in domains shared by the alpha and beta isoforms \nof POU1F1 and were functionally tested using the alpha isoform \nonly. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in a familial \ncase with IGHD and found a heterozygous and synonymous variant \n(c.150T>G, p.Ser50Ser50) in POU1F1 presented on the affected \nfather and son.  Interestedly, this variant affects POU1F1 splicing \nwithout changing the amino acid sequence. By a high throughput \nreporter assay we found that this variant shifts splicing to favor the \nPOU1F1 beta isoform almost exclusively, while retaining its tran -\nscriptional repressor activity on the POU1F1 enhancer. Therefore, \nwe conclude that this mutation is causative of the patient\u2019s pheno -\ntype, highlighting the importance of a detailed analysis of sequenc -\ning results, particularly of synonymous mutations near splicing sites, \nwhich are often overlooked.\n93.

The clinical symptoms of these pathologies overlap, hindering \ndifferential diagnosis, which is of paramount importance to estab -\nlish the standard of care. Among them, Dystrophinopathies are the \nmost prevalent type of MD and are caused by mutations in the DMD \ngene. Genetic or molecular studies are the gold standard for reach -\ning a MD differential diagnosis, for which molecular alterations in MD \nassociated genes can be detected by Whole Exome Sequencing \n(WES). One of the major challenges of the Next Generation Se -\nquencing (NGS) data interpretation is the occurrence of Variants of \nUncertain Significance (VUS). The present work aims to provide a \nthorough strategy to analyze the effect of VUS, applying different \npredictive software, conservation/evolutionary and protein modeling \ntools. A cohort of 141 patients with presumptive clinical diagnosis of \ndystrophinopathy and negative MLPA result was analyzed by WES. \nWe deepened the screening to all the MD associated genes includ -\ned in the Gene Table of Neuromuscular Disorders. In a subset of \n6 individuals, we detected VUS in the following genes: DMD (2/6), \nFKRP (2/6) and POMT2 (2/6). We implemented several predictive \nsoftware to analyze the effect of VUS, and UCSF ChimeraX for pro -\ntein modeling. Also, in one case, we could do a segregation analysis \nof the variants. The implemented strategy provided new insights to \npredict more accurately the effect of the identified sequence variants \nand even reclassified them. Finally, this work provides alternative \napproaches for the analysis of sequence variants, especially when \nfunctional studies are not possible to be carried out, to determine \nthe effect of VUS.\n94.

Molecular alterations in \nthis gene are large deletions/duplications in 80% of cases and small \nvariants in the remaining. Several authors reported the occurrence \nof non-contiguous rearrangements within the same DMD allele, with \nfrequencies up to 4%. The present work aims to characterize the \nincidence of complex rearrangements in an Argentinian dystrophi -\nnopathy cohort and unravel the causing molecular mechanisms.\nMaterials and Methods: We analyzed 437 boys with clinical diagno -\nsis of Dystrophinopathy. The following techniques were implement -\ned: MLPA, WES, WGS, PCR-Sanger Sequencing, CGH Array and \nHUMARA assay. In 2 cases, breakpoints were precisely determined, \nso we performed a bioinformatic screening of microhomologies, in -\nterspersed repeats, secondary structures and recombinogenic mo -\ntifs 50pb surrounding each breakpoint.\nResults: We detected 6 patients carrying complex rearrangements \nin DMD: 2 deletions-duplications, 3 non-contiguous duplications and \n1 large deletion plus a 20pb insertion. These accounted for 1.4% of \nour cohort. In a deletion-duplication case, familial segregation and \nbioinformatics analysis suggested that the duplication was the first \nmutagenic event caused by Fork Stalling and Template Switching \n(FoSTeS), while the deletion occurred secondly by Non-homologous \nend joining. Furthermore, bioinformatic screening of the deletion \nplus insertion propose that the deletion was due to Microhomolo -\ngy-mediated end joining, while the insertion arose by FoSTeS.\nConclusions: Our findings widen the understanding of the molecular \nevents that may take place in DMD and characterize the occurrence \nof complex rearrangements in our dystrophinopathy cohort.\n95.

The clinical spectrum \nvaries widely and can present in isolation or with other birth defects. \nWe conducted target panel genetic screening using single-molecule \nmolecular inversion probes sequencing to assess the frequency of \nmutations in known hypopituitarism genes and new candidates. We \ncaptured genomic DNA from 170 pediatric patients with CH, either \nalone or with other abnormalities. We identified novel pathogenic, \nlikely pathogenic(LP) or variants with uncertain significance in 26 \ncases. Interestingly, we found that the prevalence of known vari -\nants in transcription factor genes involved in pituitary development \nlike PROP1, and POU1F1 was quite low in our cohort. A significant \nnumber of disease-causing variants in known causative genes( L-\nHX3, LHX4, GLI2, OTX2 and HESX1) were found, and for LHX3 and MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 202074\nLHX4 variants, both in silico and functional in vitro testing using lucif -\nerase assays were performed. One important novelty from our study \nis the identification of pathogenic variants in novel genes recently \ndiscovered in the etiology of CPHD. We found two heterozygous \nvariants in FOXA2 (p.R228S and p.R229*) which may affect the DNA \nbinding ability of the coding protein in patients with IGHD and CPHD, \nrespectively, and a missense PNPLA6  variant(p.T1115P) in a patient \nwith CPHD, retinitis pigmentosa and neurodevelopmental delay. In \nthis work we were able to expand our knowledge of pituitary target \ngenes for genetic diagnosis for CH. Identifying population-specific \npathogenic variants will improve the capacity of genetic data to pre -\ndict eventual clinical outcomes for better diagnosis and treatment \nfor the patients.\n96.

Its spectrum ranges from classical \nphenylketonuria (PKU) to persistent benign hyperphenylalaninemia \n(PHPA). Genotyping has become a useful tool to either design the \ndiet accurately or to consider other treatment options now available. \nAim: to efficiently implement the molecular diagnosis for PAH related \ndisorders in our patients. Methods: 27 patients (9 female) with clin -\nical and biochemical diagnosis of HPA were included. According to \ntheir tolerance to phenylalanine they were classified as classic PKU \n(n:6), moderate (n: 8), mild (n:7) or PHPA (n:6). Six patients under -\nwent molecular diagnosis by NGS (TSO Illumina, NextSeq500) and \n21 were studied by Sanger sequencing of PAH exons and intronic \nflanking regions. Variants were classified according to ACMG criteria \nand information available in BIOPKU database. Parents and siblings \nwere studied to assess segregation for all prioritized variants. Re -\nsults: 25 different already reported variants were found. 26 patients \nwere homozygous or compound heterozygous. In one patient, NGS \nfound only one heterozygous variant but bioinformatic CNV-analysis \npredicted a PAH exon 3 deletion (confirmation pending). Most fre -\nquent variants were c.1066-11G>A (intron 10:21%), p.V388M (exon \n11:7,7%), p.R261Q (exon 7:7,7 %), p.R408W (exon 12:5,8%) and \np.R158Q (exon 5, 5,8%). 35% of all variants found were in exon 11 \nand its intronic regions, 17% in exon 12, 13% in exon 7, 7% in exons \n2 and 3, 5,5% in exons 5, 6 and 10 and 2% in exon 9. No variants \nwere found in exons 1, 4, 8 or 13. Conclusions: We were able to \nfully characterize our cohort confirming the allelic heterogeneity of \nPKU patients and the prevalent occurrence of variants in 6 exons, \naccounting for 83% of the variants found. This suggests that PAH \nmolecular characterization in our media should start with these ex -\nons and be followed by the other ones only if negative or incomplete.\n97.

Laboratorio de Gen\u00e9tica Hematol\u00f3gica, Instituto de Medi -\ncina Experimental (IMEX-CONICET)/Academia Nacional de \nMedicina\nFLT3 gene is altered in 30% of patients with Acute Myeloid Leuke -\nmia AML) associated with a worse prognosis. They are missense \nvariants affecting residues D835-I836 in the tyrosin-kinase domain \n2 (TKD) and internal tandem duplications (ITD) within the juxtam -\nembrane domain.\nOur aim was to detect the presence of these variants and to de -scribe their characteristics in patients with newly diagnosed AML.\nSamples from 215 patients with AML diagnosed between May-\n18 to Jan-20 were analyzed. DNA extraction was carried out with \ncommercial columns from mononuclear isolated cells. Detection of \nITD (spanning exons 13-14) was performed by PCR amplification, \nagarose gel visualization, and capillary electrophoresis to calculate \nthe allelic ratio, while TKD (exon 20) by PCR-RFLP and agarose \ngel visualization. Both variants were characterized by automatic se -\nquencing.\nFLT3(+) were detected in 61 (28%) patients (43 ITD, 13 TKD and \n5 ITD/TKD), presenting medians (Mdn) of age of 53 years, blasts \n75%, and higher white blood cell counts 93396/\u00b5L (vs 34149/\u00b5L \nFLT3-wt, T test, p<0.00001). ITDs were single in 41 (85%) patients \nand double in 7 (15%) with a Mdn allelic ratio of 0.4 being \u22650.5 in 23 \n(48%) patients. ITD covered 15-192 bp, residues M578-G613 were \nduplicated in 78% patients, G583-A659 in 8% and 14% of them were \naccompanied by insertions of 3-17 bp.\nTKD(+) identified were 16 single nucleotide variants and 2 indels: \n14 c.2503G>T (p.Asp835Tyr), 1 c.2503G>C (p.Asp835His), 1 \nc.2505T>C (Asp835=), 1 c.2504_2508delATATCinsTT (p.Asp835_\nIle836delinsVal) and 1 c.2502_2504delAGA, (p.Asp835del). These \nlast 2 variants were novels.\nThe results obtained show a frequency of mutations in FLT3 of 28%, \nconsistent with the literature, and a predominance of ITD vs TKD. \nThe detection by PCR and capillary electrophoresis allowed highly \nsensitive and specific results. The characterization and range of the \nsequence variants found in FLT3 gene correspond to what was pub -\nlished in the query databases.\n98.

The objective of our study was to identi -\nfy and characterize molecular biomarkers of IBD in the Argentine \npopulation. For this, the circulating expression levels within the Pe -\nripheral-Blood-Cell-Fraction (PBCF) and the intestinal expression \nlevels contained in the Fecal-Matter-Cell-Fraction (FMCF) of three \nmiRNAs were studied: hsa-miR-146a-5p, hsa -miR-155-5p and hsa-\nmiR-223-3p. 57 individuals were recruited from the Posadas Hospi -\ntal Gastroenterology Service, from which 51 blood samples (13 CT, \n20 CU and 18 CD) and 38 stool samples (12 controls, 15 CU and 11 \nCD) were obtained. Total RNA was extracted and retro-transcribed \nusing the MMLV reverse enzyme and Stem Loop Primers designed \nfor this purpose. The quantification was carried out by qPCR by \nmeans of Absolute Quantification by Standard Curve using synthet -\nic plasmids. The data obtained were statistically analyzed with the \nGraphPad Prism 6.01 program using non-parametric tests. The re -\nsults (p <0.05) showed that in PBCF miR-155-5p is overexpressed \nin patients with IBD compared to controls, and that miR-223-3p \ndifferentiates controls and patients in FMCF. Breaking down each \ndisease according to treatments, it is observed that the case-control \ndifferentiation is maintained in the mildest treatments. In CD, the ile -ABSTRACTS75\nocolonic location presents higher levels of expression of miR-223-3p \nthan the colonic one in FMCF and greater expression of miR-155-5p \nin active patients than in inactive patients in PBCF. In UC, miR-223-\n3p was shown to have a lower expression in patients with high en -\ndoscopic activity in PBCF. Our results show the biomarker potential \nof miR-155-5p and miR-223-3p in IBD as well as the potential of \ndifferent non invasive samples used for their analysis.\n99.

However, it has not been widely adopted due to \ndifficulties with health insurance coverage.\nOur aim was to describe pathogenic variants associated with my -\neloid malignancies detected by targeted sequencing approaches in \ntwo institutions of our media.\nSequencing was performed in an Illumina platform using ampli -\ncon-based targeted sequencing (Illumina Ampliseq Myeloid Pan -\nel-Hospital El Cruce, Florencio Varela) and hybrid capture-based \nsequencing (Customized Panel, SOPHiA Genetics- Laboratorio de \nEspecialidades Bioqu\u00edmicas, Bah\u00eda Blanca), to screen 40 and 30 \ngenes, respectively.\nA total of 43 patients were evaluated (16-MDS, 7-CMML, 20-AML) \nand 99 sequence variants were found (37 in epigenetic regulators, \n22 in transcription factors, 22 in signaling pathways, 10 in splicing \nfactors, 6 in damage repair and 2 in cohesins). Seven MDS patients \npresented 10 affected genes accumulating 17 nucleotide variants \nwith a media of 2 (1-5) mutated genes and 2 (1-7) sequence vari -\nants/patient. CMML patients presented 27 variants in 14 genes with \na media of 3 (2-4) affected genes and 4 (2-5) variants/patient. The \nAML cohort had a media of 2 (1-5) mutated genes and 3 (1-6) vari -\nants/patient, adding 55 variants in 20 genes. TET2 was the most \ncompromised in MDS (4/17) and CMML (11/27), while in AML it was \nDNMT3A (7/55). The median VAF was 0.48 in CMML, 0.44 in AML \nand 0.30 in MDS.\nBoth panels comprised the most relevant genes and allowed the \nidentification of pathogenic variants in 84% of patients with myeloid \nmalignancies. CMML displayed a higher media of variants with a \nhigher VAF and a prevalence of TET2, while the number of affected \ngenes was increased in AML. Sequence-based genetic tests pro -\nvide useful information, not only at clinical level, but to improve the \ndescription of altered genes and pathways in myeloid diseases.\n100.

The Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System \n(DIPSS) enables prognosis assessment at any point during clinical \ndisease follow-up. This model considers the age, hemoglobin lev -el, leukocyte count, circulating blasts and constitutional symptoms \nto predict survival. Most of patient present one driver mutations in \nJAK2, CALR or MPL genes, and the majority acquire others affect -\ning epigenetic (ASXL1, IDH1/2) and splicing (SRSF2) genes, often \nin multiple combinations.\nIn the current study, we screened hot-spot regions of ASXL1, IDH1/2 \nand SRSF2 to identify pathogenic variants and to describe their \nprevalence in the context of the DIPSS classification.\nThe series included 67 patients (61% females) with MF diagnosed \naccording to the 2016 WHO criteria. At the time of testing, the \nmedian age was 65 years old (range 20\u201388) and laboratory char -\nacteristics included a median hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL (3-16), \nleukocyte counts of 11x109/L (16-124) and circulating blast of 0% \n(0-15). The distribution according to the DIPSS was: 18% low, 18% \nintermediate-1, 30% intermediate-2, and 34% high risk. Driver mu -\ntational status revealed 49% JAK2, 30% CALR, 9% MPL and 12% \ntriple-negatives.\nGenomic DNA samples was amplified using allele-specific-primers \nfor IDH1/2 (exon 4), Sanger sequencing for ASXL1 (exon 12-13) and \nhigh-resolution melting confirmed by Sanger sequencing for SRSF2 \n(exon 1). Fifteen patients (22%) presented pathogenic variants in \nASXL1, 2 (3%) in IDH2, 1 (1.5%) in SRSF2 and 6 (9%) combined \ntwo of them. Overall mutational frequencies according to the DIPSS \nwere 3% for low, 6% intermediate-1, 9% intermediate-2 and 18% \nhigh risk patients.\nOf all the subclonal cooperating pathogenic variants found, 50% \nwere identified in the DIPSS high risk patients associated with a \nmore aggressive disease with clinical and therapeutic implications.\n101.

Over thirty monogenic forms of the disease \nhave been reported. A meta-analysis demonstrated that only 5-10% \nof patients with thyroid dysgenesis and 45-88% of patients with thy -\nroid dyshormonogenesis are diagnosed using single-gene sequenc -\ning. Here, we used single-gene and next generation sequencing to \ninvestigate the etiology of the disease.\nTen patients (p1-10) with dyshormonogenesis showing a defined \niodide transport defect phenotype were studied by single-gene anal -\nysis. Nine patients (p11-19) with thyroid dysgenesis (n=2) or dyshor -\nmonogenesis (n=7) were explored by targeted next generation \nsequencing. Patients 1 and 17 were studied by trio whole-exome \nsequencing. \nSLC5A5  gene sequencing analysis (p1-10) revealed four com -\npound heterozygous variants (c.970-3C>A/p.D369V; p.G543K/p.\nL562M) and three in homozygous state (c.1973C> T; c.1673A> \nC; p.G561E). Multiple gene sequence analysis (p11-19) revealed \nthree heterozygous variants (p.F1542V fs*20; p.Y2563C; p.S523P) \nand two compound heterozygous variants (p.Q29*/c.177-2A>C) in \nTG gene. Moreover, the analysis revealed heterozygous variants in \nDUOX2  (p.E1496D fs*51) and FOXE1  (p.P203R) genes. Finally, we \ndeepened the study of two patients (p1 and p17), without mutations \nin putative candidate genes and, in the case of p17, with an unusu -\nal autosomal dominant inheritance pattern using trio whole-exome \nsequencing. Heterozygous variants were identified in TG (p.G653D) \nand PFKFB2  [c.741-60_741-61insG(2)TG(8)] genes, the latter has \nnot previously been associated with the disease.

Garrahan\u201d\nDystrophinopathies are a group of X-linked recessive neuromuscu -\nlar disorders caused by pathogenic variants in the DMD  gene, which \ninclude Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular \ndystrophy, X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy and mild forms of the \ndisease. The spectrum of dystrophin gene pathogenic variants in -\ncludes large deletions (60%), large duplications (5-10%) and small \nvariants (30%) (missense, nonsense, indels and splicing variants) \nthat are detected by standard diagnostic methods; namely, MLPA \nand sequencing of the coding regions of the DMD   gene. Howev -\ner, in a minority group of patients (<1%) deep intronic variants are \ndetected by mRNA analysis from muscle biopsies. The aim of this \nstudy is to present the molecular findings in a patient with clinical \nsuspicion of DMD, absence of dystrophin in muscle biopsy and neg -\native molecular studies for deletions, duplications and small vari -\nants. In order to search for deep intronic variants, RT-PCR of the \nmRNA isolated from muscle biopsy was performed and the cDNA  of \nthe entire DMD gene was amplified into 14 overlapping fragments. \nSanger sequencing of these fragments revealed an insertion of 141 \nbp between exon 8 and 9. This pseudoexon inclusion introduced a \npremature stop codon at the mRNA level. Sequencing of the pseu -\ndoexon and its flanking regions of gDNA was performed to investi -\ngate the underlying mechanism causing the insertion. The variant \nNG_012232.1 (NM_004006.3): c.832-186T>G, which creates a \ncryptic 5\u2019 splicing donor site (T>G substitution at the +1 position) \nand the pseudoexon activation, was detected. Carrier status was \nconfirmed in the proband\u2019s mother. In conclusion, RNA analysis fol -\nlowed by gDNA sequencing allowed us to confirm the genetic cause \nof the disease. The introduction of a premature stop codon due to \nthe pseudoexon activation correlates with the absence of dystrophin \nin muscle biopsy. Besides, this study allowed to provide an ade -\nquate and timely genetic counselling to the family.\n103.

Garrahan\u201d\nNeuromuscular disorders (NMD) are phenotypically and genetical -\nly heterogeneous diseases. To date, 587 genes and 1042 different \ndiseases have been described. Congenital myopathies (CM), con -\ngenital muscular dystrophies (CMD), early-onset forms of limb-girdle \nmuscular dystrophy (LGMD) and congenital myasthenic syndromes \n(SMC) present in the neonatal or childhood period. NGS offers a val -\nue tool for the molecular diagnosis of NMD due to the large number \nof candidate genes, phenotype heterogeneity and overlapping clin -\nical features. Objective: to perform the molecular characterization \nin a pediatric patient cohort with clinical and pathological features \nof CM, CMD, LGMD and SMC. Methods: we included 49 patients \ndivided in four groups according to the initial clinical suspicion: CM \n(n=27), CMD (n=11), LGMD (n=1), SMC (n=7) and SMC vs MC \n(n=3). Phenotypes groups were classified according to the clinical \nsigns and symptoms in the neurologic examination, pathological \nfeatures in muscle biopsy and/or electrophysiological studies. We \ndesigned two customized NGS panels, TruSeq Amplicon (Illumina) \n(n=11) and SureSelect (Agilent) (n=44) to study 28 and 80 related \ngenes respectively. Six patients with TruSeq Amplicon negative re -\nsults were restudied with the SureSelect panel. Results:  pathogen -\nic variants were detected in 29 patients (59%); 16 cases in genes \nassociates with CM (9 RYR1 , 3 NEB, 2 ACTA1 , 1 TPM2  and 1 TTN), \n6 cases with CMD (2 COL6A1 , 1 COL6A3 , 2 LAMA2 , 1 LMNA ), 5 individuals with SMC (2 RAPSN , 1 CHRNB1 , 1 COLQ , 1 DOK7 ) \nand 2 cases with LGMD (1 CAPN3, 1 SGCG ). SureSelect technol -\nogy gave a diagnostic yield of 59% compared to 27% for TruSeq \nAmplicon. Conclusion: the diagnostic sensibility obtained in this \nstudy highlights the advantages in applying an NGS-based panel \napproach for genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous diseas -\nes such as NMD. Besides, it provides information for therapeutic \noptions for treatment conditions and can contribute to the genetic \ncounselling.\n104.

Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT) is \ncaused by a deficiency in Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase; there \nare 2 main types of PCT: hereditary and acquired. Xenobiotics, al -\ncohol, abuse drugs and hepatotropic viruses are the main trigger -\ning factors of the disease. In our country, 16% of PCT patients are \nHIV infected individuals. Previously, the influence of ABCB1 genetic \nvariants, a transporter of the same family as ABCG2, in the onset of \nPCT in HIV carriers was reported. The aim was to evaluate the role \nof the NM_004827.3:c.421C>A (rs2231142) variant of ABCG2 gene \nin the association PCT-HIV. A population of control, HIV, PCT and \nPCT-HIV individuals was studied. Genotyping was done by PCR-\nRFLP. The non-wild type allele A was in a very low frequency in \nall the groups. In PCT-HIV, the frequency of A (0.21) was higher \nthan PCT and HIV values (0.05; p<0.001). When analyzed the ge -\nnotypic frequency, SNV was in a very low frequency in heterozy -\ngosis in all the groups with higher values for PCT-HIV group (36%, \np<0.01) than PCT (10%) and HIV (9%). The AA genotype (3%) was \nonly found in PCT-HIV group. These results, although preliminary, \nsuggest that NM_004827.3:c.421C>A variant in the ABCG2 gene \ncould be related to the manifestation of this porphyria only in HIV \npatients. The analysis of the other SNVs (NM_004827.3:c.34G>A, \nNM_004827.3:c.376C>T) will allow us to establish the presence or \nabsence of risk haplotypes in the manifestation of PCT associated \nor not with HIV infection.

PCOS were di -\nvided into subgroups by the presence or absence of metabolic \nsyndrome (MS) and hyperandrogenism (HA). Peripheral blood ge -\nnomic DNA was purified and genotyped by T-ARMS PCR (Tetraam -\nplification refractory mutation system for rs 17173608 (RARRES2 \nNC_000007.14(NM_002889.4):c.280-494A>C) and PCR-RFLP for \nrs4721 (RARRES2 NM_002889.4):c.*13A>C). Statistical analyzes \nwere performed with GraphPad Prism and SPSS (t-Student test, \nANCOVA with p-values adjusted for age and \u03c72 analysis). \nResults : The PCOS patients showed a genotype distribution of TT \ngenotype (44.9%), followed by TG genotype (43%) and GG (12.1%) \nfor the rs4721; similar to the frequency found in Caucasians (Hap -\nMapProject). The population was in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (x2 \n= 0.147; p = 0.70). The rs17173608 could not be analyzed because \nof the low presence of the minor allele (4%). Through ANCOVA \nanalysis age adjusted, it was shown that the presence of rs4721 \nG allele was associated with higher levels of total cholesterol/HDL \n(p=0.04), LDL-c (p=0,02) triglycerides (p=0.03), insulin (p=0.02), \nHOMA (p=0.04), LAP index (Lipid accumulation product, p=0.03), \ntestosterone (p= 0.08), LH/FSH (p=0.03). Also, rs4721 G allele was \nassociated with larger telomere length (p=0.04) and lesser mito -\nchondrial DNA mass (p=0.08). \nConclusion : In women with PCOS, rs4721G allele was associated \nwith worse metabolic and hormonal parameters. In this preliminary \nstudy, no association was found between SNV rs4721 Chemer -\nin gene and susceptibility to MS and HA in women with PCOS.\nHEMATOLOG\u00cdA\n106.

Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nMaintenance of systemic iron (Fe) levels undergoes regulation by \nthe erythropoietic demand, inflammation and Fe status. Liver hep -\ncidin (Hep), a small peptide which binds the Fe exporter ferroportin \nthus inducing its internalization and degradation, is a key regulatory \ntarget for Fe homeostasis. \nWe examined the ability of erythropoietin (Epo) to regulate Hep \nmRNA expression (real-time PCR) in the human hepatic cell line \nHepG2. Control (C) Hep levels were significantly reduced by Epo \n(160 ng/mL, 6 h), while its non-erythropoietic, carbamylated de -\nrivative cEpo failed to exert this effect (C: 1, *Epo: 0.4\u00b10.2, cEpo: \n0.9\u00b10.1; *P<0.05 vs C). Abrogation of the Epo receptor with a spe -\ncific siRNA or a blocking antibody prevented Hep downregulation in \nEpo-treated cultures (C: 1; *Epo: 0.4\u00b10.2, siEpoR+Epo: 1.0\u00b10.1; an -\ntiEpoR+Epo: 1.0\u00b10.1; *P<0.05 vs C), showing EpoR is required for \nEpo signalling in this context. The observed decrease in Hep mRNA \nwas followed (24 h) by lower intracellular Fe levels and higher Fe re -\nlease to the culture media in Epo-exposed cells (ferrozine method). \nRegarding the simultaneous regulation of Hep by Epo and different \nextracellular Fe conditions, Fe chelation by 100 \u03bcM deferoxamine \nreduced Hep mRNA by half compared with untreated cells, while 3 \n\u03bcM Fe-citrate almost doubled it. However, higher Fe-citrate concen -\ntrations caused lower Hep levels than in untreated cultures, and only \nin this condition was Epo unable to suppress Hep (C: 1; *Fe100\u03bcM: \n0.3\u00b10.1; Fe100\u03bcM+Epo: 0.7\u00b10.2, *P<0.05 vs C). Protein levels of \ntransferrin receptor 1 were not affected by Epo, but were decreased \nby Fe addition. However, no differences were observed between 3 \nand 100 \u03bcM Fe-citrate.\nOur findings show Epo can increase Fe availability through Hep \ndownregulation in hepatic cells, though there seems to be a complex \ninterplay between Epo and Fe status. Further research is needed to \nclarify the role of Epo on Fe availability in different pathological and \ntherapeutical scenarios.\n107. (94) SELECTIVE RESPONSE OF IRON CYCLE PROTEINS \nTHROUGH IRON AND ERYTHROPOIETIN SIGNALS IN MOUSE KIDNEY.\nFern\u00e1ndez Delias MF, Roque ME.\nLaboratorio de Fisiolog\u00eda Humana. Departamento de Biolo -\ng\u00eda, Bioqu\u00edmica y Farmacia. Universidad Nacional del Sur. \nBah\u00eda Blanca.\nIron overload can be regulated by different mechanisms related \nto erythropoiesis and kidney tissue.Taking into account the labile \nnature of iron,its circulation and storage are strictly controlled.Ap -\nproaches to addressing iron trafficking through the hepcidin regu -\nlator and importer(DMT1,ZIP14) and exporter(FPN) proteins may \noffer new insights.The presence of the erythropoietin receptor(E -\nPO-R)in the kidney suggests various non-erythropoietic functions of \nEPO.This study was designed to extend our previous studies on \nthe relationship between iron overload and iron protein regulation \nto another important organ,the kidney.The non-erythropoietic func -\ntions of EPO will also be analysed.CF1mice(25\u00b15g;3m)split in(n=4/\ngroup):1 )Iron-adequate (IA);2) Iron-overload (IO)(ironsaccharate; -\ndays0,4,8,12 ip;1800mg/kg);3) EPO(days17-19ip;20000UI/kg) ;4)\nIron-overload+EPO(IO+EPO) .Immunohistochemistry:anti-DMT1( di-\nvalent-metal-transporter1),anti-ZIP14(Zrt-Irt-likeProtein14),anti-pro -\nhepcidin.I ron levels Wiener kit. The Protocol was approved by CIC -\nUAE-UNS.\nIron levels showed an increase in IO/IO+EPO  respect to IA/EPO.\nAbundant hemosiderin was observed in IO in the proximal tubule \nS2(PTS2),glomerulus and medulla;it was moderate in IO+EPO  and \nscarce in EPO/IA.The DMT1 expression was evident in the PTS2 \nand medulla in IA/EPO and slight in IO/IO+EPO .In IO the ZIP14 ex -\npression was intense in PTS2 and medulla and slight in EPO  being \nthis the predominant signal.The prohepcidin expression was intense \nin IO/IO+EPO  and slight in IA/EPO.We can conclude that in iron \noverload,a coordinated regulation of the iron cycle proteins occurs \nin the kidney,suggesting a protective mechanism against iron ex -\ncess due to the reduction of iron uptake according to the following \nmodifications:decrease in both the uptake of DMT1 and the release \nof FPN,also showing a negative regulation of kidney-DMT1 by hep -\ncidin.The cytoprotective role of EPO in controlling iron storage could \nbe explained by the reduced expression of ZIP14 observed.\n108.

Neutropenia is \nprevalent in Leukemias (Le) and Lymphomas (Li). In order to ana -\nlyze the inflammatory response the study was made on non-HIV IP \nwith Le, Li and renal transplanted IP (RT), infected (I, no-HIV) and \nwithout infection (WI); it was determined in PMN venous blood from \nIP (n=49, 48\u00b117 years, hospitalized), and healthy volunteer donors \n(C, n=30, 35\u00b112 years): oxygen consumption (\u2206O2, Clark electrode, \nindicates generation of superoxide anion, O2-), production of hydro -\ngen peroxide (H202, fluorometry), spontaneous chemiluminescence \nof PMN (CL, photon counter, measures light emission of singlet ox -\nygen (1O2)), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Increases were observed \nin IP with respect to C: \u2206O2 9 fold in WI and 3 in I (p<0.01); H2O2 \n3 fold (p<0.001) and CRP 33 (p<0.05) both in I; CL 73 fold in WI \n(p<0.0001). When analyzing results in MN and SN, \u2206O2 increased MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

In IP with Le: \u2206O2 \nincreased 14 fold in WI (p <0.001) and 17 in I (p <0.05), H202 1.5 \n(p<0.05) and CRP 17 (p <0.001) in I; in RT and Li, \u2206O2 increased \n4 fold in WI (p<0.001) and 2 in I (p<0.05); H202 3 fold in WI with \nRT (p<0.001). In IP with Li, H202 and CRP increased 10 fold with \nchemotherapy in WI (p<0.001 and 0.01) and not in IP. The inflam -\nmatory state is much higher in IP with SN; in IP with Li or Le, chronic \ninflammation would be associated with O2- production in WI; only IP \nPMNs with Le respond with H202 generation. The inflammatory state \nof IP decreases response of PMN mediated by O2- and H202, and \ngenerate oxidative damage, mediated by PMN 1O2. Chemotherapy \nincreases H2O2 production in PMN of WI with Li, effect decreased in \ninfected IP. \n109.

One of its causes is the \nautoxidation of hemoglobin (Hb), which accumulates peroxides \n(XOOH), oxidized Hb species (EOHb) and fluorescent degradation \nproducts (FHP). The bibliography presents different protocols for \nthe same method. The objective was to define the optimal condi -\ntions to evaluate EOHb, FHP and XOOH in 10 units of GR stored \nin the blood bank (DRG). The EOHb were evaluated with a spectral \nsweep between 500 and 700 nm at different concentrations and pH. \nThe most influential factor was the Hb concentration of the sample, \nadjusted to 0.7 mg/mL, followed by the pH, adjusted to 7.5. The \nFHPs represent the intracellular content of H2O2 as a fluorescence \npeak at 485 nm under excitation at 321 nm. The emission spectrum \nbetween 400 and 600 nm was analyzed at different concentrations \nand storage conditions. A peak was not observed at 485 nm, but the \nemission average between 470 and 490 nm was correlated with it \nand was more precise (CV 5.5% vs 11.4%, p <0.003). The Hb con -\ncentration was adjusted to 50 uM to standardize the quenching. The \nresults were stable for 18 days in samples stored at -80 \u00b0C. The esti -\nmation of XOOH uses cells or plasma, optionally adds Fe(II) and its \nmeasurement range oscillates between micro and millimolar. GRDs, \ntheir supernatants and plasmas with and without Fe (II), and H2O2 \ncalibrators between 0.1 uM and 100 mM were assayed. The DRGs \ndid not produce a reaction, the quantification range in acellular me -\ndia was 15 to 100 mM and Fe(II) only acted as a catalyst. The best \nworking conditions for EOHb are to adjust the Hb concentration to \n0.7 mg/mL at pH 7.5, for FHP the Hb concentration must be adjust -\ned to 50 uM, and use acellular solutions to estimate XOOH without \nFe(II) for end-point reactions.\n110. (244) REVERSION OF THE HEMATOLOGICAL AND HE -\nMATOPOIETIC ALTERATIONS PRODUCED BY 4T1 MU -\nRINE BREAST TUMOR THROUGH DOCETAXEL.\nMauro F, Bruni S, Patricia V. Elizalde, Mar\u00eda F.

Here we studied \nthe impact of D on hematopoietic populations in the bone marrow \n(BM) and the hematological parameters in peripheral blood in both \nhealthy and 4T1 tumor bearing mice, as a model of triple negative \nbreast cancer. We also studied the impact of D on the proliferation, \nmigration and survival of 4T1 cells in vitro. 4T1 cells were injected subcutaneously in female BALB/c mice and, when tumors were es -\ntablished they were treated i.p with vehicle or D 10 mg/kg twice a \nweek for 3 weeks. Healthy mice were injected with vehicle (control) \nor D. After treatment, we determined the hemogram and identified \nhematopoietic precursors by immunofluorescence and flow cytom -\netry. Proliferation and survival assays were performed by Trypan \nBlue count, and migration by wound healing assay. Mice with 4T1 \ntumor developed a myeloid leukemoid reaction with a high granu -\nlocytic count (p<0.0001), a decrease in haemoglobin (p<0.01) and \nan increase in white blood cells (WBC) (p<0.0001) vs. control. D \ntreatment diminished WBC (p<0.001) and spleen size (p<0.001) in \ntumor bearing mice. 4T1 tumor induced a macrocytic anemia with \nextremely diminished immature erythroid populations in the BM. \nCommon myeloid progenitors (CMP) were increased in BM, but not \ngranulocytic-monocytic progenitors (GMP). Proliferation, survival \nand migration diminished when 4T1 cells were treated with D in vitro \n(p<0.01). In conclusion, the 4T1 tumor induces a drastic decrease \nin different maturation stages of the erythroid populations in the BM, \nwhich is not reversed by D treatment. CMPs probably rise due to the \nlarge amount of G-CSF released by the tumor. D treatment elicits an \nantineoplastic effect not only by reducing proliferation, survival and \nmigration of 4T1 cells, but also by decreasing the marked spleno -\nmegaly and leukocytosis caused by extramedullary hematopoiesis \nproduced by 4T1 tumor.\n111.

So far, the effect \nof treatment with P Lc on blood fluidity at low flow rates, estimated \nby the kinetics of erythrocyte aggregation (EA), has not been stud -\nied. We evaluate the effect of treatment with P Lc on blood fluidity at \nlow flow rates, estimated by the kinetics of erythrocyte aggregation \n(EA) in HFD rats, characterizing cellular factors. Wistar rats fed a \nstandard diet added with 40% of first bovine juice for 28 days, then \nwere injected via i.p. every 24 hours for 10 days with: physiological \nsolution (HFD; n=6) or with P Lc 3mg/100g body weight (T10; n=6). \nThe fourth day, the rats were anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine \n(100mg/kg /3mg/kg, i.p.), obtaining blood by cardiac puncture. In \nPlasma Cho and triglycerides (TG) were determined by enzymatic \nmethods.

The protozoan can be isolated from the cervical muco -\nsa 2-3 months after intercourse and can reach the uterine muco -\nsa where it is presumed to cause abortion. Cell growth dynamics, \nvaginal environmental factors, and pathogenicity mechanisms are \nnot fully understood at this time. For the reasons stated, the ob -\njective of this study was to characterize the growth of T. foetus in \nvaginal cervical fluid (FCV) corresponding to different stages of the \nbovine estrous cycle in vitro. For this, the following methodology was \napplied, the FCV was extracted from 3 animals with synchronized \nheat every 3 days during 3 successive estrous cycles. T. foetus was \ninoculated in FCV aliquots of different stages and growth was eval -\nuated, it was analyzed by ANOVA, using Graph Pad Prism version \n5.01 software. The data show that the growth of the microorganism \nwas clearly higher in oestrous fluids, also observing a stationary be -\nhavior and correlated with the volume of FCV extracted (p <0.05). \nIn conclusion, the increased secretion of fluid in the estrous stage \nand its evident association with the proliferation of T. foetus allows \nus to understand the cell growth dynamics that the parasite could \ndevelop in vivo.\n113.

This technique \nhas great advantages over other molecular techniques such as \nPCR. It can be carried out with little equipment, with minimal training \nof personnel and achieve high sensitivity and specificity. However, \nit is not without its difficulties. The occurrence of false positives or \nfalse negatives is not unusual. Using a suitable experimental design \nit is possible to identify and optimize the components of the reaction \nthat most influence the result of the amplification. A Taguchi design \nallows this objective to be achieved quickly, minimizing the number \nof experiments and efforts. For the reasons stated, the objective of \nthis work was to evaluate the performance of a LAMP reaction under \ndifferent experimental conditions using a Taguchi design. For this, \nthe work methodology consisted in the amplification of a fragment of \nthe ef1a1 gene of Tritrichomonas foetus.  This was carried out vary -\ning the surfactant (Tween20 or Triton X-100) and the concentration \nof dNTPs (0.06-0.24mM), betaine (0.4-1.8M) and MgSO4 (2-9mM). \nThe data were analyzed by means of ANOVA, using the program, \nGraph Pad Prism version 5.01 software. Preliminary results showed \nthat the surfactant had a notable influence on the kinetics of the \nreactions, those containing Tween 20 being faster. The influence on \nthe kinetics of magnesium and betaine ions was greater in reactions \nwith Tween 20. The occurrence of false positives was minimized in \nreactions containing Tween 20 as a surfactant. In conclusion, it can \nbe suggested that the use of an appropriate experimental design \nallows not only optimizing a reaction but also studying the influence \nof each of the factors on amplification.\n114.

In the bull, \nthe presence of the parasite is asymptomatic and tends to become \nchronic in the adult animal. Infection in females occurs naturally \nduring heat and usually manifests as failed services and repetition \nof heat. In pregnant females, the protozoan can reach the uterus \nand invade the embryo tissues. The multiplication of T. foetus  must \nguarantee its persistence until a new estrus and the infection of the \nmale. For the reasons mentioned, in this work the ability of T. foe -\ntus to grow in vitro in cervical mucus (MCV) of females at different \nstages of the estrous cycle was evaluated. For this, the degree of \ncrystallization (fern formation) and the cellularity of each cervical flu -\nid were used in the work methodology in order to infer the moment \nof the estrous cycle that allows the multiplication of the protozoan. \nThe data were analyzed by ANOVA, using the Graph Pad Prism \nversion 5.01 program. The preliminary data obtained show that T. \nfoetus  showed positive growth during estrus. In contrast, no growth \nwas observed in the right-hander. The results allow us to conclude \nthat it is hypothesized that the protozoan in a natural infection must \nmodify the environment to persist in the female reproductive tract \nthroughout the entire estrous cycle.\n115.

A descriptive study was conduct -\ned between September 2016 - July 2019. Ninety-three subjects (54 \nwith AL and 39 apparently healthy individuals) were evaluated at \nthe Universidad Nacional de Tucum\u00e1n. The leukemia characteri -\nzation was performed by: blood count, cytochemistry and flow cy -\ntometry. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and catalase (CAT) serum \nactivity were determined. Transcription factor forkhead homeobox \ntype O (FoxO3a) and Nrf2, antioxidant enzymes CAT, peroxiredox -\nin-2 (PRX-2) and superoxide dismutase  (SOD), and the cytokines \ntumor necrosis factor-alpha  (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukine-6  (IL-6) gene \nexpression were analyzed with real-time PCR in peripheral mono -\nnuclear blood cells. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS \nV.25 statistical software. The comparative study was performed \nusing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov non-parametric test.  All statistical \nanalyses were considered significant at p<0,05.  We detected 41% \nof acute lymphoid leukemia, 39% acute myeloid and 20% acute pro -\nmyelocytic leukemia.

(16) DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL NS1 COMPETITIVE \nENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY FOR THE \nEARLY DETECTION OF ZIKA VIRUS INFECTION\nRold\u00e1n JS, Cassola A, Castillo DS\nInstituto de Investigacion Biotecnologicas (IIBIO)\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that has emerged as a global health \nthreat after the 2015 outbreak in the Americas, where devastating \ncongenital defects were documented. There are currently no vac -\ncines to prevent ZIKV infection nor commercially available diag -\nnostic tests demonstrated to identify ZIKV without cross-reactive \ninterference of related flaviviruses. Early diagnosis is critical when \ntreating symptomatic patients and in preventing ZIKV transmission. \nIn this context, the development of sensitive and accurate diag -\nnostic methods is urgently needed for the detection of ZIKV acute \ninfection. Recent studies have demonstrated that heat dissociation \nof the NS1 homo-hexamer, a useful diagnostic marker for flavivirus \nearly detection, is a convenient alternative to enhance the sensibil -\nity of commercially available ELISAs by an increase in the antigen \navailable monomeric forms. With this strategy in mind, we aimed to \nobtain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against denatured monomeric \nZIKV NS1 (ZNS1) protein in order to develop a highly specific and \nsensitive ZNS1 indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA). The produc -\ntion of hybridomas secreting ZNS1 mAbs was carried out through \nimmunizations with denatured monomeric ZNS1. We selected two \nspecific hybridoma clones, 1F5 and 6E2, which recognized the \nheat-denatured ZNS1 form by indirect ELISA. In addition, cross-re -\naction studies indicated that these mAbs specifically recognize a \nZNS1 linear epitope, and that they do not cross-react with the NS1 protein from other related flaviviruses. The1F5 mAb enabled the de -\nvelopment of a sensitive, reliable and reproducible icELISA to detect \nand quantify ZNS1 disease marker in heat-denatured human sera. \nWe established a valid 1F5 based-icELISA that allows the detection \nand quantification of small amounts of ZNS1 (156 ng/ml), and con -\nstitutes a promising bioanalytical method for control strategies and \nthe prevention of ZIKV propagation.\n118.

The most common \nspecies is Larrea divaricata , known as female jarilla. The ethanolic \nextract of L. divaricata  leaves has reported as antifungal when test -\ned against S. cervisiae , C. albicans y A. niger .  Nordihydroguaiaretic \nacid (NDGA), found in the resin of leaves and stems, has inhibitory \neffects on the ecdysis of Rhodnius prolixus; and extends the life \ncycle of Aedes Aegypti. Members of the Zygophyllaceae family have \ndemonstrated larvicidal activity against Cx. Pipiens , antifeeding \nand repellent activity against Sitophilus oryzae . However, no stud -\nies were found on the bioactivity of L. divaricta  against the cereal \npest Tribolium castaneum  (Tenebrionidae). The storage pest  T. cas -\ntaneum  is a major pest of both raw and processed commodities. \nThis study was designed to evaluate the bioactivity of L. divaricata , \nagainst the T castaneum . Samples were collected, in the province \nof La Pampa. The phytochemical extraction was performed using \norganic solvent extraction as well as aqueous extraction, according \nto conventional techniques. T. castaneum , two stages, larvae and \nadults were used (10 insects per well), four doses (2.5 to 50 mg) \nwere evaluated, in triplicate. The solid resin was tested on the one \nhand, and the methanol extract on the other. The number of dead in -\nsects was recorded every 24 hours for 7 days post treatment. Com -\nparisons among groups of data were done using one-way ANOVA, \nan associated probability of P<5% was considered significant. The \nresult showed that, extracts from L. divaricata lack insecticidal ac -\ntivity under the conditions tested. In conclusion, L. divaricata  does \nnot present insecticidal and repellent activity against the T. castane -\num. However, these preliminary results are of interest, since there \nare no previous works in this regard.\n119.

The binding of HlyA \nto a putative toxin-specific receptor produced contradictory results. \nGlycophorins (GPs) were characterized as presumed receptors in \nhorse red blood cells (RBCs), though other studies indicated HlyA \ndid not interact with a specific protein receptor in rabbitRBCs. Con -\nversely, we previously demonstrated that HlyA induces a decrease \nin humanRBCs (hRBCs) deformability and the release of ATP, ef -\nfects usually associated to the interaction of ligands with GPs. \nOBJECTIVES  Study the contribution of GPs and alternative mem -\nbrane proteins in mediating the hemolytic effects of HlyA on hRBCs. ABSTRACTS81\nMETHODS  We tested the lytic activity of HlyA on hRBCs pretreated \nwith different antibodies to block the binding of HlyA to GPs (an -\nti-GPA/GPB, anti-GPA and nanoantibody iH4), and also on the rare \nclinical mutant GPA/GPB null hRBCs. We measured the dissociation \nconstant between GPA and HlyA, ProHlyA (inactive protoxin) and \nHlyA\u0394914-936 (HlyA mutant lacking the binding domain to GPA) by Sur -\nface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Finally, we performed Far Western \nBlot assays plus mass spectroscopy analysis, to explore whether \nHlyA binds to a specific hRBC membrane protein other than GPs. \nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS  The hemolytic activity was slightly \ninhibited by high concentration of anti-GPA/GPB. Surprisingly, the \nhemolytic activity of the toxin on the rare clinical mutant GPA/GPB \nnull was similar to control RBCs, indicating that GPs are not neces -\nsary for HlyA activity. SPR measurements indicated that the three \nproteins variants bind with similar strength to GPA, and to human \nseroalbumin, showing that the binding of the proteins to GPA is un -\nspecific. Far Western Blot results showed that HlyA interacts with \ntwo hRBCs membrane proteins. The next step is to study the specif -\nic interaction between HlyA and membrane proteins on hRBCs in a \nmore biological environment using a Pull Down assay.\n120. (28) TRICHOMONAS SPP.

Par -\nasitic infection in the oral cavity has not been well studied and it is \nthought to be underreported. \nHere we present a case report of an oral lesion present in a kidney \ntransplanted patient. The presumptive diagnosis: drug-induced ul -\ncers, CMV or EBV lesions or ulcers caused by mycosis. Toxic effect \nof medication was discarded due to the minimal dose administered.\nThe biopsy showed non-specific ulcers with a fibrinoleukocyte layer, \nlymphoplasmacytic infiltration with diffused neutrophils and eosino -\nphils. Ziehl Neelsen, Giemsa and immunostaining for CMV did not \nshow positive results for any specific microorganisms. EBV was also \ndiscarded. The sample from the swab test showed Streptococcus \nviridians and normal oral microbiota. Direct microscopic observation \nof moist sample showed a motile pyriform protozoon with flagellar \nmovements compatible with Trichomonas spp.  Trichomonas tenax \nwas a variant of T. vaginalis that developed genotypic changes and \nacquired a phenotype suitable to the ecosystem of the oral cavity. \nIt was  isolated from periodontal pockets and expressed proteinas -\nes that could disrupt the host tissue integrity promoting oral tissue \ndestruction.\nAlthough it is not possible to identify the strain of Trichomonas  nor \nto prove causality between the presence of the protozoan and the \ndevelopment of oral ulceration in our patient, the clinical response \nto treatment and the absence of other pathogens indicates that this \nparasite was likely acting as a pathogen. \nIn conclusion, this is the first case that highlights the possibility that \nTrichomonas spp. should be considered as a potential etiological \nfactor in the pathogenesis of oral disorders in immunosuppressed \npatients.\n121. (55) rRNA OPERON COPY-NUMBER IMPACT ON \nGROWTH RATE IN Brucella AND  Bradyrhizobium .\nMedici I, Roman\u00ed A, Campanelli C, Bartrol\u00ed L,  Comerci DJ, \nMongiardini E y Soler Bistu\u00e9 AInstituto de Investigaciones Biotecnol\u00f3gicas \u2013Universidad de \nSan Mart\u00edn/CONICET\nGrowth rate (GR) varies widely among bacterial species. Com -\nparative genomics suggest that the structure of the chromosome \ncontributes to determine GR. In particular, bacteria bearing a high \nnumber of ribosomal operons ( rrn) display higher GRs. The rrn num -\nber varies widely across bacteria ranging from 1 to 11 copies, with \nan average of 6 copies per genome. Alpha proteobacteria from the \ngenera Bradyrhizobia  and Brucella  are capable of interacting, either \nsymbiotically or pathogenically, with hosts. These bacterial groups \nshow a low GR which makes its study difficult. Close examination \nof complete genomes within these group of slow growers, shows \nthat these clades bear 1 to 3 rrn. To test the links between their slow \ngrowth and ploidy of ribosomal RNA genes, we compared GRs of \ndifferent isolates and we modified the rrn content within the studied \ngroups. \nOn one hand, we compared growth through manual and automat -\ned growth curves, of completely sequenced strains of the Bradyrhi -\nzobium  genus: B. diazoeficiens  USDA110 and B. diazoefficiens \nUSDA122, with one rrn and B. japonicum  E109 and B. japonicum  \nUSDA6T that have 2 rrns. We observed that strains bearing 2 rrn \ngrew faster, displayed a shorter lag phase and outcompeted strains \nwith 1 rrn when co-cultured. On the other hand, the Brucella  ge-\nnus, that groups microorganisms causing brucellosis, bear 3 rrn. We \nobserved that deletion of one rrn by allelic replacement, caused a \n20% decrease in GR of Brucella suis  1330 . In sum, rrn ploidy seems \nto impact GR in slow growers from Alpha proteobacteria. This may \nhave a large impact on how these bacterial groups interact in host, \nparticularly in Brucella  pathogenesis causing brucellosis. Further, \nreducing rrn ploidy in Brucella suis  might have a greater impact in \nits physiology without altering gene content. Such changes could \nreduce their pathogenicity making this strategy attractive to develop \na strain to test as a vaccine. \n122. (198) BESNOITIA SP. INFECTION IN A NATURAL POPU -\nLATION OF VIZCACHAS (LAGOSTOMUS MAXIMUS, RO -\nDENTIA) IN BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA\nRuth Cwirenbaum, Santiago Andr\u00e9s Cortasa, Maria Clara \nCorso, Alfredo Daniel Vitullo, Veronica Berta Dorfman, Julia \nHalperin \nCEBBAD, Universidad Maimonides.\nOur laboratory uses vizcachas as a model for reproductive endocri -\nnology studies and we have often found abnormal cyst-like struc -\ntures in ovaries. Our specimens come from a natural population at \nLa Plata. A coccidian parasite that affected several domestic rabbits \nfrom a rabbit breeder in La Plata was the first report of a Besnoi -\ntia infection in Argentina. To evaluate whether vizcachas could also \nbe host of this parasite, we examined histological sections of various \nfemale organs. Pinhead-sized tissue cysts were found in ovaries, \nadrenals, mammary glands, uterus, pituitary, brain, spleen and fas -\ncia. Either superficial or deep tissue cysts were simultaneously seen \nin several organs of the same animal. Cysts were found in both preg -\nnant and non-pregnant females. Histologically, a thick wall made up \nof an outer layer of collagen fibers and an inner granular-looking lay -\ner surrounded each tissue cyst, which was packed with numerous \nbradyzoites and some host nucleated cells. Outside the cysts, host \ncellular structures showed normal appearance. Mammary gland aci -\nni of infected pregnant females showed normal morphology and the \novaries exhibited follicles in different stages despite the presence of \ncysts. These results indicate that infection with this parasite would \nnot affect the reproductive process. The presence of cysts in brain \nareas could be indicative of the parasite ability to cross the blood-\nbrain barrier whereas cysts in the embryonic organs suggest the \nsame for the placental barrier. Based on a comparative morpholog -\nical analysis with the tissue cysts exhibited by the naturally-infected \nrabbits of La Plata we identified ours as Besnoitia sp . This is the first \nreport of L. maximus  as a host for Besnoitia . Considering that bovine \nbesnoitiosis is a serious problem affecting Middle East, Asia, Africa \nand Europe with significant economic losses, our report is highly \nrelevant since the distribution map of L. maximus  largely overlaps \nwith that of Argentinian cattle.MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

Paladini\u201d,\n Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad de Buenos \nAires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nAlpha hemolysin  (HlyA) is the major virulence factor of uropathogen -\nic Escherichia coli  (UPEC) pathology, causing 50% of all extraintes -\ntinal disease in humans \u2014 such as urinary-tract infection, pyelone -\nphritis and septicemia \u2014 and the expression of HlyA was found to \ncorrelate with the severity of the infections produced. During sepsis, \nHlyA is released in the vasculature where it can directly interact with  \ncell membranes of red blood cells (RBCs). Sublytic concentrations of \nthe toxin caused changes in RBC morphology, activation of endog -\nenous sphingomyelinases and externalization of ceramide. All these \nevents induced the delivery of microvescicles containing the toxin in \nthe membranes. In this work we studied the interaction of HlyA with \nisolated platelets. Results show that a relatively low toxin concentra -\ntion (10.36 nM) induced the release of lactate dehydrogenate, thus \nindicating a cytotoxic effect. Morphological changes of HlyA-treated \nplatelets were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), \nevidencing a disruption in the external platelet structure. We also \nmeasured the rise in intracellular calcium concentration, by flow cy -\ntometry, finding increments in the concentration of the cation directly \ncorrelated with toxin concentration. Overall results show that pure \nHlyA isolated from E.coli , caused cytotoxicity and morphological \nchanges in human platelets, providing the basis for futher studies on \nthe signaling pathways activated by this toxin in bloodstream cells.\n124.

Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, Departamento de Fitoqu\u00ed -\nmica, Universidad Nacional de Asunci\u00f3n\nIn recent years there has been an increase in the incidence of in -\nfections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus  (MRSA) strains, \nboth in Paraguay and in the world. Bacterial biofilms constitute a \nresistance mechanism, which can cause treatment failure and the \nchronicity of infections. In this context, the study of the antimicrobial \nactivity of plants has acquired renewed interest due to a large num -\nber of compounds with biological activity that they can produce. This \nexperimental study was carried out to evaluate the inhibitory effect \nof plant extracts on the formation of biofilm in MRSA isolates that \ncause invasive infections in Paraguayan children, representative of \nthe most frequent clones in Paraguay and the region. The inhibito -\nry effect of the biofilm formation of 20 methanolic plant extracts, of \ngenera for which there are bibliographic references of some antimi -\ncrobial activity, was analyzed on the mentioned SARM isolates. The \ntest was carried out using the method described by Stepanovic et \nal. (2000), which is based on the formation and fixation of the biofilm \nin the wells of the flat-bottom polystyrene microplate and staining it \nwith crystal violet. The optical density (OD) reading was performed \nat 570 nm in an ELISA plate reader (Multiskan GO, ThermoFisher \nScientific, Finland). The inhibition percentage of each extract was \ncalculated mathematically, and the cut-off point criterion for the in -\nterpretation of the plants extracts effect on the biofilm as described \nby Famuyide et al. (2019). Excellent inhibitory activity was observed \nfor five of the 20 extracts studied, with high inhibitory activity against most of the SARM isolates used. These findings constitute a starting \npoint for the exhaustive study of these plants, to elucidate the pos -\nsible components involved in the observed inhibitory effect and to \ndetermine the mechanisms of action involved in it.\n125.

Shiga toxin (Stx) is the main \nvirulence factor of EHEC and the main responsible for the onset \nof HUS. Although many efforts have been made to develop an ef -\nfective treatment for Stx-mediated HUS, a specific therapy has not \nbeen found yet. It is well known that human consumption of bovine \ncolostrum has therapeutic effects against several gastrointestinal \ninfections, as it contains a range of peptides and proteins (includ -\ning antibodies) with antimicrobial and endotoxin-neutralizing effects. \nConsistent with these findings, we have previously demonstrated \nthat colostrum from Stx type 2 (Stx2)-immunized pregnant cows ef -\nfectively prevents Stx2 cytotoxicity and EHEC O157:H7 pathogenic -\nity.

Furthermore, this pasteurized/dehydrat -\ned and reconstituted HIC-Stx2 preserved the protective properties \nagainst EHEC infection in a weaned mice model. In this regard we \npropose that hyperimmune bovine colostrum has the potential to be \nadministered to patients with the aim of protecting children against \nEHEC infection.\n126. (288)  ROLE OF ESPF FROM ENTEROHAEMORRAGIC \nESCHERICHIA COLI  O157:H7 ON THE MECHANISMS RE -\nLATED TO PRODUCTION OF SHIGA TOXIN TYPE 2.\nToytoyndjian EV, Garimano N, Amaral MM, Ibarra CA.\nLaboratorio de Fisiopatogenia, Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda, \nInstituto de Fisiolog\u00eda y Biof\u00edsica Bernardo Houssay (IFIBIO \nHoussay-CONICET), Facultad de Medicina,\nEnterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli  O157:H7 (EHEC) strains are \nresponsible for multiple clinical syndromes including bloody diar -\nrhea, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is a systemic disease ABSTRACTS83\ncaused mainly by Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2). EHEC employs a type \nIII secretion system to colonize the bowel and to inoculate effector \nproteins such as EspF.  This protein is responsible to disrupt tight \njunctions, inhibit phagocytosis and induce effacement of microvilli \nand apoptosis. However, the role of EspF on the mechanisms re -\nlated to Stx2 production across human intestine are not well known. \nThe EHEC \u2206espF  mutant was constructed by Chengsong Wan and \nco-workers (Zhao et al. PlosOne 2013). We have evaluated the \nequivalent amount of Stx2 on Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) cultured \nwith the supernatants of EHEC wild type (SNwt) and EHEC \u2206espF \n(SN\u2206espF ). \nBoth strains, EHEC O157:H7 wt and EHEC O157:H7 \u2206 espF  were \ngrown in LB medium for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C in LB with shaking at 150 rpm \nand then diluted 1:10 in DMEM/F12 medium with the addition of 10 \nmM of HEPES and grown to exponential phase (optical density at \n630 nm of 0.3-0.4). Bacterial supernatants were collected after cen -\ntrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min and sterilized by filtration through a \n0.22-\u00b5m-pore-size filter. The titers of Stx2 of filter-sterilized superna -\ntants were determined on Vero cells. \nA significant cytotoxic effect was observed when monolayers of Vero \ncells were exposed to different concentrations of purified commer -\ncial Stx2 under growth-arrested conditions. The CD50 was maximal \nafter 72 h of incubation. Both, SN wt and SN \u2206espF showed similar \ndegrees of cytotoxicity on Vero cells corresponding to equivalent \namount of Stx2 calculated by a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test.\nThis initial trial shows that the absence of the gene EspF  might not \nsignificantly affect secretion of Stx2 in the bacterial culture. More \nstudies are needed to evaluate the effect of EspF on Stx2 production \nof EHEC.\n127.

The goal of this \nstudy was to develop a model that incorporated heterogeneity in \ncontact rates and to implement it in a user-friendly application for \nthe estimation of the impacts of possible interventions. An exten -\nsion of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model \nwas developed, called SEIR-HL which assuming two subpopula -\ntions with different contact rates. A formula for the calculation of the \nbasic reproduction number (Ro) for n subpopulations was derived. \nSEIR-HL was compared to SEIR showing that the incorporation \nof contact rate heterogeneity results in predictions with earlier but \nsmaller infected peaks and lower total numbers of infected. SEIR-\nHL was used to show that transferring individuals from high-contact \n(H) to low-contact (L) positions delays and reduces infected peaks \nand lowers the total number of infected. Fitting SEIRL-HL to SARS-\nCoV-2 epidemic data in Argentina shows that the data is consistent \nwith an increase in contact rates around May. Finally, since a fu -\nture vaccine supply is unlikely to suffice for massive vaccination, \nSEIR-HL and the Ro formula were used to estimate the impact of \nthe selective vaccination of age groups, the 20-39 year population \nbeing the best target for the reduction of Ro (and therefore of the \nspread of the infection) and the population over 70 being the best \ntarget for the reduction of hospitalization and mortality. The model \nalso predicts that the younger population with high contact rate is \nmore likely to have a high fraction of recovered individuals as the ep -\nidemic progresses meaning that vaccination of this population might \nbe to a great extent redundant. The SEIR-HL model, an extended \nversion for more than two subpopulations and a Ro calculator were \nimplemented informatically and made available to the community \n(ecm.famaf.unc.edu.ar ).   128.

The viral behaviour recreates a fractal \nrhythm,property of dynamic and non-linear systems, feasible to \nbe analyzed by mathematical algorithms. The frequency of tempo -\nral appearance and the state of adaptation to the environment of \nCOVID-19 can be determined through the Fractal Dimension (DF) \nand the predictive determination coefficient (R\u00b2). R\u00b2 ranges from 0 \nto 1, values below 0.5 would indicate a decrease of the COVID-19 \nsystem response to the environment demands. It was proposed to \ninvestigate the predictive behaviour of COVID-19 according to its \nfrequency of temporal appearance by the Higuchi algorithm (AH) in \nArgentine Republic (RA), Santa Fe Province (PSF) and Rosario City \n(CR). Observational, longitudinal and prospective study. Positive \ncases (CP) of COVID-19 were considered by testing (PCR swab -\nbing) according to daily reports from the Ministry of Health of RA \nand PSF, from the epidemiological week (SE) in which the first CP \nappeared in each territory until the SE-36. AH was applied by SE. \nDF and R\u00b2 were expressed as median (M) and Standard deviation \n(\u00b1). Outcomes: DF (RA): M = 1.40 \u00b1 0.3, R\u00b2 (RA): M = 0.84 \u00b1 0.13; \nDF (PSF): M = 0.62 \u00b1 0.16, R\u00b2 (PSF): M = 0.49 \u00b1 0.15 and DF (CR): \nM = 0.43 \u00b1 0.13, R\u00b2 (CR): M = 0.42 \u00b1 0.14. Pearson correlation \ncoefficient obtained between DF and R\u00b2 for RA: r = 0.91 (p\u02c20.0001); \nPSF: r = 0.74 (p\u02c20.0008) and CR: r = 0.82 (p\u02c20.0001). It is concluded \nthat COVID-19 behaviour in RA shows growing and sustained tem -\nporal manifestation and interaction of the system with the environ -\nment, while in PSF and CR it has found limitations to interact with \nthe environment. COVID-19 could hold for longer in RA compared to \nPFS and CR if the actual conditions sustain. This behaviour requires \nstudying the impact of sanitary measures in analyzed territories.\n129.

Currently, the treatment \nfor echinococcosis in humans relies on benzimidazoles. However, \nthe emergence of resistant parasites, makes the discovery of new \nanthelmintic drugs an imperative need. To tackle this problem, we \npropose to characterize G-protein coupled receptors from cestodes \nas new pharmacological\ntargets. In our previous work1, we found that serotonergic GPCRs \n(5-HT GPCRs) are of major importance in cestode movement and \nshowed distinctive pharmacology. Objective : the aim of this work \nwas the bioinformatical characterization, function and localization of \na new 5-HT GPCR from Echinococcus canadensis . Material and \nmethods: Bioinformatics analyses suggest the existence of genes \nencoding 5-HT GPCRs. Using this information, a novel cDNA coding \nfor a new 5-HT GPCR was cloned, sequenced and expressed in \nHEK293 cells. Intracellular levels of calcium were measured. Hy -\nperimmune antiserum was generated against the receptor protein \nand confocal laser microscopy was used to study the localization \nof the receptor. Results: When the cell line was transfected with a \ngene encoding for the receptor, the calcium levels increased only \nin the presence of serotonin but not with of other biogenic amines. \nWhole mount immunofluorescence revealed branched fibers cor -\nresponding to the nervous system of the worm. Conclusion: The \ndataset confirms the bioinformatic analyses showing that the cloned \ngene codes for a new 5-HT GPCR conserved in cestodes with major \nroles in the nervous system of the parasite. The molecule analyzed \nhere could be exploited at the pharmacological level to design or \nrepurpose drugs to treat neglected diseases caused by cestode \nparasites.\nReferences 1. Camicia F et al.

UBA-CONICET\nTypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is a complication of Shiga \ntoxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection and the most \nfrequent cause of acute renal failure in children in Argentina. Stx2 \nbinds to globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) receptor and causes direct \ndamage on human renal microvascular endothelial cells (HGEC). \nPreviously, we found that Eliglustat (EG), a Gb3 synthesis inhibitor, \nprevents the cytotoxic effects of Stx2 on HGEC. In this work, we \nevaluated the action of EG against the effects of Stx2 in vivo. Male \nBALB/c mice at weaning (17-21 days) received 3 doses of EG (0.6 \nmg/g body weight (bwt) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) every 24 \nh. After a rest period of 5 days, mice were i.p. injected with a lethal \n(1ng/g bwt) or sublethal (0.1 ng/g bwt) dose of Stx2 (EG+Stx2) or \nPBS (EG). Two additional groups of mice without EG pre-treatment \nwere injected one with PBS (Ctrl) and another with Stx2 (Stx2). \nSurvival, body weight (\u0394 weight= body weight after Stx2 or PBS \ninjection-body weight at a day before injection) and food intake were \nregistered daily. EG did not affect body weight gain (\u0394 weight: EG: \n0.61 \u00b1 0.07 g vs. Ctrl: 0.76 \u00b1 0.09 g; n=3, ns). After Stx2 lethal dose \ntreatment, EG+Stx2 mice showed a body weight decrease and a \nsurvival time (48-72 h) similar to Stx2 mice. On the contrary, after \n3 days of Stx2 sublethal dose injection, while Stx2 mice exhibited \npiloerection and inactivity and body weight loss, EG+Stx2 mice did \nnot show signs of illness and gained weight (\u0394 weight: EG+Stx2: \n0.81 \u00b1 0.09 vs. Stx2: -0.65 \u00b1 0.05 g; n=3, p<0.05). Body weight loss \nin Stx2 mice was associated with a significant decrease (70%) in \nfood intake, unlike EG pre-treated mice that reduced intake by only \n15% (n=3, p<0.05).  These results suggest that EG may reduce the \ndisease symptoms caused by Stx2, such as poor appetite and the \nresulting body weight loss. Future studies will analyze if EG prevents \nthe renal damage and will improve EG treatment to avoid mortality.\n132.

These diseases \nhave a reduced number of safe and efficacious approved anthel -\nmintic drugs; therefore, the identification of novel drug candidates \nis urgently required. In this work, we present the anthelmintic profile \nof several series of recently developed selective histone deacety -\nlase (HDAC) inhibitors (benzhydroxamate derivatives) against the \nisotype 8, using the model cestode Mesocestoides vogae  (syn. M. \ncorti). Phenotypic screenings were performed measuring parasite ABSTRACTS85\nmotility together with optical microscope observations. Several com -\npounds showed potent anthelmintic activities, producing a significant \nreduction on parasite viability and inducing extensive alterations on \ngeneral morphology. Two of these compounds, TH65 and TH92, \nshowed the most powerful anthelmintic effects, displaying anthel -\nmintic effects in a dose-dependent manner, with micromolar range \nactivities, and inducing drastic alterations on general morphology \nand ultrastructural features. These effects were irreversible and with \nhigher potencies than the current anthelmintic drug albendazole. Ad -\nditionally, binary combinations of HDAC8 inhibitors and albendazole \nshowed potent anthelmintic effects in a time-dependent manner at \nvery low concentrations, suggesting an apparent synergistic effect. \nHowever, the effects determined for some compounds were not \ncomparable in concentration and/or incubation time to those pre -\nviously reported on Schistosoma mansoni  viability and human cell \nlines, suggesting differences in the affinity for HDAC8 from M. vogae  \ncompared to other HDAC8s. We expect that this work contributes to \nunderstand the role of HDAC enzymes on cestodes, in order to aid \nin developing of new anti-parasitic treatments against NTDs caused \nby these parasites.\n133.

Albendazole, the main drug used against \nCE, has undesirable side effects and their efficacy is about 50%. \nThus, n ew treatment alternatives are urgently needed. In the last \nfew decades, there has been an increased interest  in studying the \nanthelmintic activity of natural products.  Plants from  Stevia  genus \n(Asteraceae) are a potential source of antiprotozoal and antimicro -\nbial compounds. The antiparasitic activity of extracts from different  \nStevia  species has recently been demonstrated on  Trypanosoma \ncruzi  and Leishmania braziliensis . In the current study, we demon -\nstrated the  in vitro  efficacy of the  Stevia multiaristata  dichlorometh -\nane extract against protoscoleces of  E. granulosus. Viable and \nfree protoscoleces were treated with 100, 50, 10 and 5 \u03bcg/ml of \nthe extract. Culture tubes were followed microscopically every day. \nViability assessment using the methylene blue exclusion test and \nultrastructural studies with scanning electron microscope were per -\nformed. Control protoscoleces remained viable throughout the ex -\nperimental period and no morphological changes were observed. \nThe greatest protoscolicidal effect was observed with the concen -\ntrations of 100 and 50 \u03bcg/ml, where viability decreased rapidly to \n0 % at days 6 and 9, respectively. The concentrations of 10 and 5 \n\u03bcg/ml reduced the viability to 50% between days 5 and 6. At day 1, \nthe protoscoleces treated with 100 \u03bcg/ml showed soma contraction \nand at day 3 a total loss of morphology, total loss of microtriches, \nrostellar disorganization and presence of blebs in the tegument.

This event may be followed by \nthe seroconversion or the appearance of anti-HBs antibodies, in -\ndicating recovery and a life-long immunity against HBV. The aim of \nthis study was to describe the characteristics and the evolution of \na cohort of patients who achieved anti-HBs seroconversion after \nantiviral treatment. All 6 patients included in the study were male, \nwith a median age of 48.33 years (34-64 years). They have been \npreviously diagnosed with chronic HBV infection and treated with \nnucleos(t)ides analogues (entecavir or tenofovir). All patients were \nHBeAg (+), indicating no long term chronic infections. The biochem -\nical and virological responses were followed during treatment evalu -\nating different parameters. At diagnosis transaminases were elevat -\ned in all cases, but normalized in half of the cases at week(wk)-12 \nand in the rest half at wk-48. Elevated total and direct bilirubin levels \nwere detected in 2/6 patients and one of them normalized at wk-\n48. All patients showed high pretreatment viral loads (>108copies/\nmL), resulting over treatment in undetectable loads in 1/6 patients \nat wk-24 and in 5/6 at wk-48. Regarding seroconversion, all patients \nachieved HBsAg loss in a mean time of 32 months (12-72 months) \nand anti-HBs detectable titles in 40 months (15-96 months) since the \nundetectable viral load. To indeep in the characterization, genomic \nsequences were obtained from subgenotye F1b samples (the most \nprevalent in the city). No mutations at BCP and pC regions were \ndetected and neither mutations associated with antiviral resistance \nwere found at the POL gene.

Systemic risedro -\nnate (Ris) has been reported to have anti-leishmania properties and \nEudragit EPO (EuE) has shown in vitro activity against L. (L.) ama -\nzonensis . The aim of this work was to investigate the in vivo efficacy \nof topical Ris and EuE-Ris complexes on CL. Surface charge and \nRis release kinetics from the different dispersions were analyzed. \nBALB/c mice were infected intradermally with promastigotes of L. \n(L.) amazonensis . Ulcers were treated with 100 \u00b5l of Ris or EuE-Ris \nhydrogels, both containing 2 mg of Ris, once a day from Monday to \nFriday during three weeks. All the lesions that received topical Ris or \nEuE-Ris showed an improvement with respect to control: reduction \nof ulcer average size, cicatrisation, flattened edges and no signs \nof necrosis. In addition, a marked parasitic inhibition of 69.5 and \n73.7% was observed in the groups treated with Ris and EuE-Ris, \nrespectively. The IgG2a/IgG1 ratio in mice treated with Ris (0.53) or \nEuE-Ris (0.4) showed higher levels than in the control group without MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

Stx \nis the main virulence factor responsible for this disease and Stx \ntype 2 (Stx2) has been associated with more severe cases affecting \nmainly children under 5 years of age. Breastfeeding is one of the \nleast cost-effective public health tools to protect the newborn from \ndiarrhea and its effectiveness can be attributed to different bioactive \ncompounds transmitted through milk. We have previously demon -\nstrated that rats immunized against Stx2 can transfer through lacta -\ntion protection against a lethal dose of Stx2 to their offspring. In this \nwork we aim to evaluate whether human milk from human healthy \ndonors may have protective properties against Stx2. Human milks \n(n=107) were collected under informed consent at the National Hos -\npital Prof. Alejandro Posadas by the manual method from healthy \nwomen (18-45 years). After collection, milks were stored at 20\u00b0C \nuntil used. Milks were delipidated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm \nfor 45 min. Supernatant was collected from samples and used for \nthe evaluation of: 1) Neutralizing capacity of Stx2 in vitro  on Vero \ncells, 2) Total protein content by the BCA kit 3) Total IgA content by \nradial immunodiffusion (RID) and 4) Ig Anti STEC titer by ELISA. \nCollected milk samples showed a mean of 229 mg/dL of total IgA \nlevels (range: 10-675 mg/dL). Total protein content of samples was \nheterogeneous and ranged from 5.5 to 166.5 mg/ml. Fourteen milk \nsamples (14/107; 13%) showed neutralizing properties against Stx2 \nin vitro . When comparing IgA levels and protein content of positive \nand negative samples for Stx2 neutralization, no significative differ -\nences were observed. Neutralizing capacity of Stx2 has no correla -\ntion with high Ig titer against STEC. These results indicate that some \nhuman milk may have neutralizing properties against Stx2. These \ndata may be important for HUS prevention of newborn by promoting \nbreastfeeding.\n138. (304) CORRELATION BETWEEN PROINFLAMMATORY \nMEDIATORS AND VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION IN AN \nEXPERIMENTAL MODEL OF CHAGAS DISEASE IN IL10 \nKO MICE\nRada MJ1, Donato M2, Alba Soto C3, Penas FN1, Pieralisi \nAV1, Cevey A1, Mascolo P1, Gelpi RJ2, Mirkin GA3, Goren \nNB1.\n1-Instituto de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas en Retrovirus y \nSida (UBA-CONICET).\n2-Instituto de Fisiopatolog\u00eda cardiovascular (UBA).\n3-Instituto de Investigaciones en Microbiolog\u00eda y Parasitolo -\ng\u00eda M\u00e9dica (UBA-CONICET).  \nChagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc) infection, is \nconditioned by parasite persistence and the development of an in -\nflammatory response. Interleukin 10 (IL10) is a pleiotropic cytokine \ninvolved in the regulation of inflammatory processes. In previous \nworks we showed that Fenofibrate (Fen), a PPAR\u03b1 synthetic ligand, \nmodulates inflammation and restores cardiac function in T. cruzi -in -\nfected wild type mice. Furthermore, infection of IL10 knockout mice \n(IL10 KO) with the K98 clone of CA-I Tc strain triggered ventricular \ndysfunction and the increase of expression and concentration of \nproinflammatory mediators. Fen treatment inhibited the expression \nand release of inflammatory mediators and restored the ventricular \nfunction. Taking this into account, we considered to analyze the cor -\nrelation between various proinflammatory mediators and ventricular \nfunction. Using Spearman correlation test, we observed that there \nis a strong correlation between the increased mRNA expression \nof IL6, NOS2, TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 in cardiac tissue, as well as with \nthe increase in plasma concentration of IL6, TNF\u03b1, and IL17 with \nthe decrease in the percentage of both Ejection Fraction (EF) and \nShortening Fraction (SF) in Tc-infected IL10 KO mice. The strongest \ncorrelations were observed between the concentration of IL6 (r=-1) \nand TNF\u03b1 (r=-0.94), and expression of TGF\u03b2 mRNA (r=-0.95) with \nboth EF and SF. Treatment with fen inhibits the expression and re -\nlease of these mediators, thus improving ventricular function. This is \nevidenced by the decrease in the correlation between these proin -\nflammatory mediators, and both EF and SF. Meanwhile, no asso -ABSTRACTS87\nciations were found between the studied parameters in WT mice, \nsince infection did not cause ventricular dysfunction. These results \nsuggest a strong correlation between expression and release of \nproinflammatory mediators and ventricular dysfunction caused by \nK98 infection in IL10 KO mice.\n139.

We previously demonstrated in a murine infec -\ntion model that fenofibrate (Fen), PPAR\u03b1 agonist, controls inflam -\nmation, prevents fibrosis and improves cardiac function. Consider -\ning that different subpopulations of monocytes (mono) are involved \nin the progression of cardiomyopathy, we decided to characterize \nthese subpopulations according to the stage of the disease and to \nevaluate if in vitro treatment with Fen drives mono towards a tissue \nrepair profile. Seventeen healthy individuals (HI) and 16 patients \nwith positive serology for Chagas, without (E0) and with chronic \nChagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) were included. Peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells were purified, cultured and stimulated or not with \nT. cruzi (Tc) lysates (10\u03bcg / ml), and treated with Fen (100\u03bcM). Un -\nder basal conditions, CCC showed a higher percentage of classical \nmono than E0 (p <0.05) and E0 a higher percentage of non-classical \nmono than HI (p <0.05). Stimulation with Tc increased the percent -\nage of classical mono in E0 and Fen inhibited this effect (p <0.05). \nWe also found that Fen increases non-classical mono in HI and E0 \n(p <0.05). To decipher the ability of mono recruitment to the site of \ninfection or their repair functions, we evaluated CCR2 expression. \nTc decreased both the expression of CCR2 as well as the percent -\nage of CCR2+ mono (p <0.05) in HI, E0 and CCC, and Fen tended \nto restore it. The same effect was observed in mono subpopulations.\nAltogether, these preliminary results suggest that E0 patients remain \nin a ?more alert? state, with a higher percentage of basal non-classi -\ncal mono that increases with Fen. Signs of inflammation or damage \nmight mobilize them for rapid endothelial transmigration. We also \nbelieve that Tc stimulation triggers the internalization of CCR2, and \nFen might reverse this effect.\n140.

Roffo, Facultad de Medicina, \nUniversidad de Buenos Aires.\nBladder cancer (BC) is a common malignancy of male urinary tract. \nAccording to the invasion degree, tumors are classified as non-mus -\ncle invasive (NMI) and invasive (MI). The constitutive expression \nof the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which pro -\nduces high levels of nitric oxide (NO), is a poor prognostic marker \nin human BC, associated with invasion and early recurrence. We \npreviously showed that its pharmacological inhibition with L-NAME \nin NMI tumor-bearing mice (TBM) reversed tumor immunosuppres -\nsion and improved the response to gold standard BCG treatment.\nObjectives:  To evaluate the variations on cytotoxic (CD8+ and NK \ncells) and immunosuppressive (Treg) immune populations on iN -\nOS-expressing MI murine BC model under L-NAME treatment and \nto analyze its combination with BCG.\nMethods:  Ex vivo : Normal splenocytes were stimulated in vitro  with \nMB49-I cells in presence of L-NAME (2mM) +/- BCG (2mg/ml).  In \nvivo: Splenic and tumor leucocytes of normal mice and MI MB49-I TBM treated with 0.5 g/L L-NAME in drinking water were analyzed. \nThe percentage of CD8+, NK cells and Treg were quantified by flow \ncytometry.\nResults:  The ex vivo  stimulation of splenocytes with MB49-I cells, \nwas able to increase CD8+ (p\u22640,01) and reduce Treg (p\u22640,05), re -\nspect to unstimulated splenocytes. The combination of L-NAME \nwith BCG increased NK cells (p\u22640,01) and reduced Treg (p\u22640,05), \ninducing the highest relation CD8+/Treg (p\u22640,001). MB49-I TBM pre -\nsented a decrease in CD8+ and NK cells (p\u22640,001) and an increase \nin Treg (p\u22640,05) compared to normal mice. L-NAME treatment was \nable to decrease Treg and increase CD8+ (p\u22640,001).\nConclusion:  NO inhibition with L-NAME reverses an immunosup -\npressive state in MB49-I TBM. Its combination with BCG improves \nthe relation CD8+/Treg, suggesting an increased anti-tumor immuni -\nty. Inhibitors of NO production may be potential immunomodulators \nfor patients with iNOS positive BC.\n141.

This study aimed at further exploring the role \nof H4R in the immunobiology of breast cancer.\nWe used wild type (WT) and H4R deficient (H4R-KO) Balb/c mice \nto evaluate whether H4R genotypes show different distribution of T \ncell subsets in spleens, tumours and tumour draining lymph nodes \n(TDLN) in a syngeneic ErbB2-positive breast cancer model devel -\noped orthotopically with LM3 cells and its impact on tumour growth.  \nIn addition, the migration capacity of TDLN cells from WT and KO \nanimals was analyzed.\nThe presence of tumours had a differential impact on the distribution \nof T cells in TDLN from H4R-KO mice compared to WT ones. At \nday 21 post inoculation (p.i.) of cells, despite no significant changes \nin the tumour weight, TDLN from H4R-KO mice showed a signifi -\ncantly increased proportion of CD8+ T cells compared to WT mice \n(P=0.0052). At day 38 p.i. of cells a reduced tumour weight was ev -\nident in H4R-KO mice (P=0.0431). This was accompanied by a de -\ncreased proportion of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells in TDLN \nof KO compared to WT mice (P=0.0104).  In agreement with the \ntumour weights, the spleen weight was significantly reduced in tu -\nmour-bearing KO mice compared with WT counterparts (P=0.0280). \nTumour-bearing KO mice showed a better survival compared to WT \nmice (P=0.0511). Furthermore, H4R deficient TDLN lymphocytes \nshowed impaired chemotaxis compared with WT mice (P=0.0054).\nWe conclude that H4R-mediated mechanisms may modulate the im -\nmune tumour microenvironment, promoting an immunosuppressive \nmilieu. Results suggest that H4R could be explored as an immuno -\ntherapeutic target with potential benefit in combination with immu -\nnotherapy. \n142.

However, ICI \nwere effective to restrain only incipient experimental tumors. Fail -\nures of immunotherapy may be associated with the fact it would \nproduce weak immune responses that would promote rather than \ninhibit tumor growth upon activation of TLR4 and p38 signaling path -MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 202088\nways. Herein, we compare the effect of ICI on the growth of both \nincipient and residual tumors. Then, we have combined ICI with \nmeta-tyrosine (m-tyr) - which, according to previous results, might \nrestrain immune checkpoints not counteracted by classical ICI - and \nSB 202190, a selective inhibitor of p38, to counteract the tumor-im -\nmune-stimulation. We have used two murine tumor models: a local \nrecurrence after subcutaneous (s.c.) MC-C fibrosarcoma (about 800 \nmm3) was surgically excised leaving intact the underlying skin; and \na metastatic model after s.c. LMM3 mammary carcinoma (LMM3) \nwas radically removed when spontaneous lung metastases were al -\nready established. One day after surgery, mice were treated with ICI \n(anti-CTLA-4 for MC-C, or anti-PD-L1 for LMM3) or a combination \nof ICI with m-tyr and SB 202190. Local recurrences and metastases \nwere not inhibited by the very same treatments that strongly inhibit -\ned incipient tumors (p < 0.001). In fact, growth of local recurrences \nupon treatment with ICI was enhanced similarly that mid-sized tu -\nmors from which residual tumors derived (p<0.01). The combined \ntreatment not only produced tumor-inhibitory effects (p<0.001 for \nMC-C and p<0.01 for LMM3) but even it managed to cure about \n80% of mice bearing local recurrences and about 40% of mice bear -\ning lung metastases while in controls 100% of mice bearing residual \ntumors reached the humane endpoint in a month after surgery. The \nuse of tumor models that closely resemble the real clinical situation \nmight be useful to understand both the scope and the limitations of \nanti-tumor immunotherapies.\nINMUNIDAD INNATA\n143.

It was described that the NKG2A+ subpopulation can success -\nfully control both primary infection and EBV-mediated transformation \nin children from developed countries.\nIn this study we characterized the NK cells in the tonsils of a cohort \nof 47 pediatric patients infected or not with EBV. We defined EBV \nstatus by serological assay, the presence of CD56, IFN\u03b3 and Gran -\nzyme B (GzB) by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the expression \nof CD56. CD16.

Here, we studied whether the secretion of \nsmall extracellular vesicles (sEVs) mediates these beneficial effects. \nThe rat lung preservation model used here consisted of: cardiac ar -\nrest, warm ischemia (2h), cold ischemia (1.5h), and normothermic \nex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP, 1h). Human umbilical cord-derived \nMSCs (1x10^6 cells) or their secreted sEVs were administered via \nthe pulmonary artery after 1h of warm ischemia. A decrease in lung \ncompliance indicates poor graft quality, and it was determined from \npressure-volume curves at baseline and after warm ischemia or \nEVLP. Small-EVs were purified from MSC-conditioned medium by \nanion-exchange chromatography. They were positive for CD63- and \nCD81-antigen, and showed the typical size (mean 137 nm, range \n90-190 nm) and morphology by nanoparticle tracking analysis and \nelectron microscopy, respectively. Moreover, sEVs significantly sup -\npressed the M1 phenotype acquisition in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 \nmacrophages (53% respect to control). Interestingly, sEVs inhibit -\ned tissue damage quickly. After warm ischemia, lung compliance \ndropped by 42% in the sEVs-treated group, while vehicle and MSCs \ngroups showed a stronger reduction (73% and 76%, respectively). \nWarm ischemia also produced edema in all groups. Noteworthy, the \nbenefit of EVLP on recovering edema and lung function was more \nevident in treated groups. Lung compliance significantly dropped \nby 62% between baseline and EVLP in the vehicle group, whereas \nMSCs and sEVs protected lung function as evidenced by a small -\ner decrease (35% and 27%, respectively). These data indicate that \nMSC-derived sEVs play a key role in preserving lung function. Com -\npared to cell therapy, sEVs provide rapid protection of the organ \nand have a superior safety profile. Thus, sEVs may represent an \ninnovative cell-free therapy for organ preservation.\n145. (146) DEVELOPMENT OF TWO IN VITRO  ANGIOGENIC \nMODELS TO EVALUATE THE PRO-ANGIOGENIC CAPAC -\nITY OF DERMAL PAPILLA SPHEROIDS\nOppenheimer FM, Ceruti JM, Leir\u00f3s GJ, Bala\u00f1\u00e1 ME  \nICT-Milstein (CONICET)\nTissue-engineered skin represents a useful treatment of deep skin \ninjuries. The neovascularization, essential to supply oxygen and nu -\ntrients to the cells in grafted constructs, remains a major challenge. \nWe have shown that the presence of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) in \nthese constructs favors the vascularization process, resulting in a \nbetter wound healing and graft take. We also have seen that 3D cul -\nture increases the expression of angiogenic factors as VEGF, angio -\ngenin and FGF. Our objective was to fit two models to evaluate the \nDPC\u2019s culture influence over the ability of endothelial cells (HUVEC) \nto migrate and form tubules in vitro .ABSTRACTS89\nFor the migration assay, isolated DPC or fibroblasts (Fbs) were cul -\ntured in a transwell and maintained at 37\u00b0C for 72 hours.  HUVEC \nwere then seeded on the insert and placed into wells. After 8 hours, \nwe observed 12% more migrated cells in the coculture with DPCs \nthan in the fibroblast and control.\nFor tubulogenic assay, DPC conditioned medium was concentrated \n10 times and diluted by half in fresh medium. HUVEC were resus -\npended in the mixed medium and seeded on Matrigel. We observed \nan increase in the total tubule\u2019s length and in the number of seg -\nments and joints, compared to control. The higher differences were \nobtained at 5 hours.\nTo compare the inductive molecules secretion between 2D and 3D \ncultures, we looked for the condition in which both systems con -\ntained approximately the same amount of metabolically active cells. \nWe obtained that 55 spheres of 5,000 cells each with 72 formation \nhours are metabolically equivalent to 10,000 cells/cm2 monolayer \nseeded cells, cultured during the same period.\nProgress was made in the development of two angiogenic models \nthat would allow us to study the influence of 3D culture of DPCs \non the capacity of endothelial cells to migrate and to form tubules \nin vitro . In this way, its use in skin substitutes could favor the vas -\ncularization of the grafts, favoring the closure of the wound and the \ngraft take.\n146.

Stress mitigation in stem \ncells is critical both attributable to their essential role in development \nand the risk for malignant transformation. In these cells, redox sta -\ntus regulates the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, \nmaking crucial o xidative stress control . Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) \nis a highly relevant component of the antioxidant system. Besides \nits cytoprotective function, HO-1  is involved in embryo development \nand in ES cells differentiation. At the same time, p53 controls cellular \nresponse to multiple types of harmful stimulus, including oxidative \nstress. Particularly, the primary role of p53 in ES cells is to promote \ndifferentiation in response to DNA damage or developmental sig -\nnals. Despite the role of both proteins has been extensively studied, \nlittle is known about their relationship. The aim of this work is to \nexplore the HO-1 - p53 interplay in ES cells. W e found that p53 \nknockout (KO) ES cells have higher HO-1 levels but similar HO-1 \nmRNA levels than the wild type (WT) ES cell line. Furthermore, \nevaluation of NRF2, the main HO-1 transcription factor, showed no \nsignificant differences in both its total levels and its active form with \nphosphorylation at Ser40 between p53 KO and WT cells. Cyclohexi -\nmide treatment revealed increased HO-1 abundance in p53 KO cells \nsuggesting that p53 modulates HO-1 protein stability. Notoriously, \ndespite higher HO-1 basal levels in KO cells, both hemin treatment \nand differentiation induced HO-1 expression. Finally, H2O2 treat -\nment did not increase HO-1 levels in p53 KO ES cells evidencing \nan altered response to oxidative stress. Our findings demonstrate \nthe existence of a connection between p53 and HO-1 in ES cells \nhighlighting the relationship between these stress defense pathways \nin the stem cells context.\n147.

Hospital Nacional Alejandro Posadas, Buenos Aires, Ar -\ngentina.\nThe placenta and fetal membranes have been proposed as an im -\nportant stem cell source for regenerative medicine. Amniotic epithe -\nlial cells (hAECs) can be isolated from the amnion of the human \nplacenta at term. They are pluripotent and they have immunomod -\nulatory, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative properties. These fea -\ntures position hAECs as an ideal candidate for cell therapy. Hepatic \nfailure is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality world -\nwide. The available treatments have several obstacles. Recently, \nhAECs have been spotlighted as an alternative hepatocytes source \nbecause of their potential for hepatogenic differentiation. The aim of \nthis work was to study the regenerative capacity of the hepatocyte \ndifferentiated hAECs (HD) in a CCl4-induced liver fibrosis mouse \nmodel. Previously, we have demonstrated that hAECs efficiently dif -\nferentiate to hepatic-like cells. We demonstrated that these hepato -\ncyte-like cells are functional by determining collagen and albumin \nexpression. HD cells were transplanted into CCl4-induced hepatic \nfibrosis BALB/c mice. After 4 weeks of injection, liver fibrosis charac -\nteristic parameters such as necrosis, collagen deposition, and liver \nenzyme levels were evaluated. We found that the fibrotic nodules \ndecreased in livers transplanted with HD cells. Moreover, the HD cell \ntransplantation reduced the necrosis area and the proinflammatory \ncell infiltration, evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. We also \nobserved that the collagen deposition, significantly diminished by \n1.68-fold in the HD group, analyzed by Masson\u2019s trichrome staining. \nIn addition, the ALT, AST, and AF liver enzyme levels decreased up \nto 1.18-fold, 1.25-fold, and 1.16-fold respectively, after HD cell treat -\nment, compared with the CCl4 group. Altogether, our results demon -\nstrate the potential application of hAECs derived hepatocyte-like \ncells for liver disease treatment.\n148.

The \nmicrospheres were developed from a mixture of chitosan (CHI) and \na copolymer of vinyl acetate and hydrolyzed diisopropyl fumarate \n(PVFH). For the synthesis of the microspheres, the mixture of PVFH \nand CHI solutions in a 50:50 ratio of the polymers was made, using \nborax as a crosslinking agent. The aqueous polymeric mixture was \nsonicated for 5 min and was dripped above olive oil with a controlled \nflow under 1500 rpm magnetic agitation at 28 \u00b0C. The emulsion ob -\ntained was left under stirring for 24 hours. Finally, the microspheres \nwere isolated by centrifugation. The oil phase was discarded and \nsuccessive washes were performed with distilled water until neutral -\nity. The mean diameter and size distribution of microspheres were \nstudied using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 inverted optical microscope \nand pictures were taken with a Nikon Coolpix 4500 digital camera. \nThe biocompatibility of microspheres was assessed in vitro  using \nmurine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells and mesenchymal stem cells \n(MSC), in the presence and absence of microspheres. In both cases, \nproliferation was studied using the MTT bioassay at different times. \nAlso, we evaluated the production of nitric oxide (NO) with RAW \n264.7 as an immunogenic marker, using the Griess test. The mean \ndiameter of the microspheres was 96.6 \u00b1 2.8 \u00b5m. The results with \nRAW 264.7 cells on proliferation and NO levels did not show signifi -\ncant differences between cultures with and without microspheres at \n24 and 48 h. In the assay using MSC, it was observed that prolifer -\nation at 48 h was favored in the presence of the microspheres. In \nconclusion, microspheres with a suitable size as a microcarrier were MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

Laboratorio de Investigaciones Aplicadas a las Neurocien -\ncias \u2013 FLENI- CONICET\nHuman embryonic stem cells (hESCs) exhibit an unusual cell cy -\ncle structure with an abbreviated G1 phase. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) \nare small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in many key \nprocesses; including cell cycle regulation and cell differentiation, as \npost-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. E2F transcription \nfactors (E2Fs) regulate G1/S transition. G1 duration contributes to \nhESCs fate determination and miRNAs play a key role in achieving \nthis cell cycle regulation. Due to this, we aimed to identify miRNAs \nthat are regulated by E2Fs in hESCs. Importantly, we had previous -\nly reported high mRNA expression levels of the canonical E2Fs in \nhESCs line H9 in comparation to somatic cells (human fibroblasts). \nFirst, we treated H9 hESCs with the general inhibitor of E2Fs (pan-\nE2F inhibitor) HLM006474. Concentration and incubation time used \nfor HLM006474 treatment was fine-tuned by studying the cell cycle \nprofile of hESCs-treated cells determined by measuring DNA con -\ntent by propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry anal -\nysis. A 20mM HLM006474 concentration and 24 hours treatment \nwas chosen for further experiments as it induced an increase in G1 \ncell population in H9 hESCs. Next, we performed a RNA-seq anal -\nysis of small RNAs of H9 hESCs treated or not with HLM006474 \ninhibitor (20mM, 24h). We found that 52 miRNAs were differentially \nexpressed upon E2Fs inhibition (FDR: 0.1), some of which were al -\nready related with E2Fs family and others whose relationship with \nthese factors or with hESCs-cell cycle has not yet been reported. \nFinally, upon validation of the expression levels of 20 selected miR -\nNAs candidates by RT-qPCR with specific stem loop primers, we \nconcluded that miR-19a-3p, miR-19b-3p, miR-4454, miR-1260a, \nmiR-1260b, miR-454-3p and miR-301a-3p would be transcriptional -\nly regulated by canonical E2Fs.\n150. (381) DEVELOPMENT OF A FIJI PLUGIN FOR THE ANAL -\nYSIS OF PREVIOUSLY SEGMENTED IMAGES WITH \nDEEP LEARNING: APPLICATION IN A SKELETAL MUS -\nCLE REGENERATION MODEL.\nWaisman A1, Norris A2, Kopinke D2\n1. FLENI-CONICET\n2. University of Florida, USA\nThe quantitative analysis of fluorescence microscopy images has \na fundamental role in biology and medicine. One of the biggest \nchallenges in the field is to detect cells stained for different markers \nautomatically. The recent development of deep learning algorithms \nsuch as Cellpose is revolutionizing the field and bringing us closer \nto the wide adoption of image cytometry techniques. However, this \nalgorithm returns its results in labelled image format, and its use is \ntherefore limited to people with programming skills. The objective \nof this work was to develop a plugin for the FIJI / ImageJ software \nthat would allow the use of segmentations generated in Cellpose by \nscientists with basic knowledge in image analysis. Our plugin ex -\ntracts the objects from the labelled images and returns them in the \nform of regions of interest or ROIs. We checked its performance \nin cross-sectional images of mouse skeletal muscle labeled for \nlaminin or stained with phalloidin or WGA. Cellpose allowed thou -\nsands of muscle fibers to be identified in each image. However, \nthe cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements of the fibers were \nstrongly biased by the type of staining used, being up to 30% higher \nthan those obtained by manual segmentation. The incorporation of \na segmentation erosion tool into our plugin allowed us to correct this \nbias, making them practically indistinguishable from those gener -\nated manually by experts. We tested the use of Cellpose together \nwith our plugin in muscle damage and regeneration tests, where \nthere is an overall change of the average CSA. Taking into account that manual segmentation of each image can take days, the use of \nCellpose and our plugin allows a very significant saving of time and \nwide adoption by users without programming knowledge.\n151. (426) GENERATION OF KNOCKOUT STEM CELL LINES \nTO STUDY THE FUNTIONAL ASSOCIATION OF lncRNAs \nAND CIS-REGULATORY REGIONS DURING CARDIAC \nDIFFERENTIATION\nScaraf\u00eda MA1, La Greca AD1, M\u00f6bbs AM1, Milone PM1, Perez \nN1, Waisman A1, Sevlever GE1, Luzzani CD1, Moro LN1, Mi-\nriuka SG1.\n1. Laboratorio de Investigaciones Aplicadas a Neurociencias \n(LIAN), Instituto Fleni-CONICET.\nLong non-coding RNA genes (lncRNA) were identified more than \na decade ago, and since, they have been shown to fulfill a diverse \nrange of functions. Particularly, their interaction with neighbouring \nregulatory regions has been proposed to modulate protein coding \ngenes within the constraints of higher-order chromatin organiza -\ntions during cell differentiation. However, many aspects of their \nregulatory functions are still unclear. Therefore, we set to identify \nlncRNAs differentially expressed (DE) during cardiac differentia -\ntion, which may be potentially involved in modulating gene expres -\nsion through cis-regulatory regions (super-enhancers, SE). To this \nend, we first differentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) \ninto cardiomyocytes (CM) and performed RNA sequencing. Data \nanalysis revealed 2,208 DE-lncRNAs between the cell populations \n(FDR<0.05), of which 729 co-occurred with an active SE (in respect \nto cell identity) within the boundaries of a Topologically Associat -\ning Domain (TAD). The co-occurrences were statistically significant \nwhen compared to a random distribution (p-value<0.001), indicating \na possible functional association between the two features. Next, \nwe implemented a protocol to modulate the expression levels of 8 \nselected candidates among the 729 DE-lncRNAs (4 expressed in \nhiPSC and 4 in CM) for the evaluation of their functional implica -\ntion in gene regulation. To do so, we used a CRISPR/Cas9-based \nstrategy to generate knockout (KO) hPSC lines for each candidate \nlncRNA. We designed two CRISPR RNA guides flanking the region \nwhich includes the promoter and the first exon to efficiently disrupt \nexpression. Successful excision of target candidates was evaluated \nby PCR directly on genomic DNA from transfected pools of cells. In \nconclusion, we identified a set of lncRNAs that may be implicated \nin regulating gene expression through cis-acting regulatory regions \nand designed a KO strategy to functionally assess their role during \ncardiac differentiation.\n152.

It revealed a yet unexplored group of 56 \nmicroRNAs transcribed during pluripotency and whose expression \ndecayed during the early mesoderm stage. These microRNAs are \nclustered in a primate-specific 100 kb sequence at chromosome 19, \nhence known as C19MC. To ascertain a possible role of this cluster ABSTRACTS91\nduring early human embryogenesis, we generated a C19MC-de -\nficient human induced pluripotent stem cell line using CRISPR/\nCas9. When maintained under pluripotency conditions, these cells \ndisplayed no evident changes in the cell cycle, apoptosis, or differ -\nentiation markers compared to control cells. However, this line was \ndrastically impaired to differentiate into cardiac and endothelial lin -\neages, evaluated both by RT-qPCR, flow cytometry and a total lack \nof contractile cardiomyocytes. Since cardiac and endothelial lineag -\nes share a common mesodermal progenitor, we evaluated different \nmarkers, and found that early mesodermal genes MESP1/2, TBX6 \nand EOMES were downregulated compared to wild type cells, while \nthe early ectoderm marker SOX2 was upregulated. Since the bal -\nance between TBX6 and SOX2 has been reported as critical for gas -\ntrulation, we next explored the genome-wide transcriptional changes \nby performing an RNA-seq at 0h and 24h of cardiac induction in the \nparental and C19MC line, a period that in vitro recapitulates gastru -\nlation. Gene ontology analysis showed a global dysregulation of the \ndifferentiation pathways ERK/FGF, VEGF, NODAL, as well as focal \nadhesion related genes. We then performed an Ago-IP RNAseq ex -\nperiment in pluripotency conditions with miR-520a over-expression \nand found an enrichment of WNT, FGF, and NOTCH signaling path -\nway genes. Thus, we show that the C19MC miRNA cluster has a \ncritical role during early mesodermal specification.\n153.

IMEX-CONICET / Academia Nacional de Medicina.  \nDesmin is a type III intermediate filament encoded by the DES gene, -\nmainly expressed in striated muscle,and is involved in contraction, \norganelle location and gene expression.Mutations in DES generate \nprotein absence or abnormal protein folding disrupting cytoskeletal \norganization,mitochondrial function and the ubiquitin-proteasome \npathway,among others.These phenotypes are known as desminop -\nathies and have an incidence of 1 in 2000 patients.Obtention of pa -\ntient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells(iPSC) allows the mod -\neling of a desminopathy in vitro .In this work,we aim to generate and \ncharacterize a stable iPSC of a male patient with a congenital de -\nsminopathy (DES-J).DES-J has nucleotide triplet duplication in DES \nexon 6 which leads to a Glu353 incorporation. DES mutation was \nconfirmed by Sanger sequencing and in silico  analysis revealed the \naminoacid incorporation alters desmin folding.To generate DES-J \niPSC,a blood sample was taken from the patient and erythroblasts \nwere reprogrammed by infecting with STEMCCA lentiviral vector.A \nclonal iPSC DES-J colony was amplified for further characteriza -\ntion.STEMCCA silencing was confirmed by RT-qPCR and normal \nkaryotype of DES-J iPSC line was ensured through G-banding.For \npluripotency validation,alkaline phosphatase activity was confirmed \nand flow cytometry analysis revealed positive staining for the plurip -\notency markers CD326 and TRA-1-81.Expression of NANOG ,OCT4  \nand SOX2  was assessed by immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR.Fi -\nnally,we proved that DES-J iPSC was capable of differentiating into \nthe three germ layers by embryoid body formation and their charac -\nterization.These results enable to conclude that DES-J erythroblasts \ncould be reprogrammed and developed pluripotent characteristics \nsuccessfully.Our next step is to differentiate validated patient-de -\nrived DES-J iPSC into cardiac and skeletal myocytes in order to \nunravel the desminopathy.Our final purpose is to develop a person -\nalized therapy that reverses the diseased phenotype.\n154.

In \nthese cells, redox status regulates the balance between self-renew -\nal and differentiation, making crucial oxidative stress control. Heme \noxygenase (HO) is the limiting enzyme in heme catabolism, and the \ninducible isoform HO-1 is known by its antioxidant and antiapoptotic \nfunctions. In the last years, new functions of HO-1 in the context of \npluripotency were reported. Interestingly, it is required for efficient \ninduced pluripotent stem cells generation and also, for specific dif -\nferentiation processes, making its role in such different processes \nan enigma. In these contexts, the modulation of its expression re -\nmained unexplored. The purpose of this work was to study HO-1 \ngene regulation in ES cells. In this work we found that HO-1 is ex -\npressed in ES cells, localize both in nucleus and cytoplasm and is \ninduced during differentiation. Since in silico  analysis of HO-1 gene \npromoter region displayed multiple putative binding sites for plurip -\notency transcription factors (TFs) we analyzed whether they were \ninvolved in HO-1 gene regulation by a shRNA approach. We found \nthat Oct4 downregulation increased HO-1 mRNA levels in ES cells. \nIn agreement, by analyzing available data from ChIP-seq experi -\nments, we found that this TF binds to HO-1 promoter region in ES \ncells. Moreover, Oct4 ectopic expression in heterologous systems \nrepressed both HO-1 gene promoter reporter and endogenous \nHO-1 gene, further supporting that this pluripotency TF represses \nHO-1 gene expression. We have previously found pluripotency TFs \nregulate the expression of other relevant genes involved in oxidative \nstress defense in ES cells. The results presented in this work pro -\nvide further evidence to the connection between pluripotency and \nredox homeostasis and could contribute to unveil HO-1 functions.\n155.

To this end, we \ngenerated a transgenic insect cell line that constitutively expresses \nthe G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). The ratio -\nnale is that baculoviruses propagated in these cells would acquire \nVSV-G inserted in the envelope of budding virions.\nThe ORF encoding VSV-G was cloned into the expression plas -\nmid pIP-vsvG.

Then, we used the virus propagated in these \ncells to transduce human liver hepatocellular cells (HepG2) and \nhuman lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549). Transfection efficiency \nassesed by red fluorescence showed a higher performance of AcM -\nVPV amplified in Hi5-vsvG, compared to the control.

When the thermodynamic\nand pathogenic impact of different groups of apoA-I point variants \nwas compared, we found that mutations associated with amyloid \npathologies showed a destabilizing effect when compared against \nHDL-deficiency or natural variants extracted from the gnomAD data -\nbase (p-value 0.05, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test).\nMD simulations of the amyloid variant G26R evidenced an increase \nin the exposure of APR1 with respect to the wild type protein (p-val -\nue  0.1, Tukey\u2019s Test) and the occurrence of \u03b2-strand secondary el -\nements at the C-terminus of apoA-I. Our findings highlight APR1 as \na relevant component for apoA-I structural integrity and emphasize \na destabilizing effect of amyloid variants that leads to the exposure \nof this region. This information contributes to our understanding of \nhow apoA-I, with its high degree of structural flexibility, maintains a \ndelicate equilibrium between its lipid-binding function and its intrinsic \ntendency to form amyloid aggregates. In addition, our stability mea -\nsurements could be used as a proxy to interpret\nthe structural impact of new mutations affecting apoA-I.\n157.

Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Gunma Uni -\nversity Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, \nJapan.\nEpicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a visceral AT surrounding myo -\ncardium and coronary arteries, emerged as an important actor in \ncoronary artery disease (CAD). The increase in its volume is an in -\ndependent risk factor for CAD. We have previously demonstrated \nthat lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity is increased in EAT from CAD \npatients, potentially contributing to the increase in the tissue volume. \nEAT composition could contribute to CAD as well. Whether circu -\nlating markers reflect EAT behavior is still unknown. Our aim was \nto evaluate LPL and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high \ndensity lipoprotein-binding protein-1 (GPIHBP1) levels in serum and \nEAT from CAD patients, as well as tissue and lipoproteins lipidomic \nprofiles, searching for possible parallelisms. \nMaterials and methods: in serum, EAT and subcutaneous AT (SAT) \nfrom patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CAD,n=25) \nor valve replacement (No CAD,n=25), LPL and GPIHBP1 levels \nwere evaluated by immunoassays and western blot, respectively. \nIn serum, lipoprotein profile was assessed, and very low and high \ndensity lipoproteins (VLDL and HDL) were isolated by ultracentrifu -\ngation. Tissue and isolated lipoproteins lipidomes were evaluated \nby UHPLC-MS using a LC C18 column and a Q-Exactive plus mass \nspectrometer, in positive and negative ionization modes.\nResults: Insulin-resistance markers were higher in CAD (p<0.05). \nSerum LPL levels were decreased (p=0.045) in CAD, without differ -\nences in EAT or SAT. Circulating GPIHBP1 levels were decreased \nin CAD (p=0.047), while EAT GPIHBP1 expression was increased \n(p<0.001). EAT lipidome was enriched in bioactive lipids such as \nCeramides in CAD, and 51 species were found in common between ABSTRACTS93\nEAT and lipoproteins. A positive correlation between EAT and lipo -\nproteins was found in 5 lipid species.\nConclusion: EAT lipidome would contribute to CAD risk. The tissue \nunique characteristics should be evaluated locally, given that circu -\nlating factors would not reflect EAT behavior. \n159.

Animal models might be an essential tool for the under -\nstanding of the regulation of body weight and metabolic pathways \nafter bariatric interventions.\nMethods: An experimental analytic study was performed using male \nWistar rats. Animals were divided in 6 groups of 12 rats each: Con -\ntrol (C), Metabolic syndrome induction (MS), Sleeve Gastrectomy \n(SG), MS + SG for 6 (SG6), 12 (SG12) and 24 (SG24) weeks. Oxi -\ndative (Nitric Oxide, Fibrinogen, Superoxide Dismutase, Miloperox -\nidase), metabolic (Blood glucose, Triglycerides, Total Cholesterol, \nLDL, HDL and TC/HDL-C index) variables, weight loss and food \nintake were assessed.\nResults: The survival of the animals was satisfactory. MS showed a \nstatistical significant increment of oxidative and metabolic variables \nand weight. SG induced an improvement of the affected variables \nthat tended progressively towards control. The induced weight loss \nwas associated to the intake.\nConclusions:  The proposed model might be reproducible and se -\ncure. Sleeve gastrectomy in rats has shown to improve the impaired \noxidative and metabolic assessment.\n160.

NAC is also an antidote for acetaminophen (AP) \nhepatotoxicity in vivo , decreasing to 50% the levels of hepatic as -\npartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities after 24 h NAC treatment. Our aim is to evaluate \nhorticulture extracts (HE) with antioxidant capacity (AO) as hepatic \nprotectors and compare their effects with NAC. Methods: Assays \nwere conducted with HE from Citrus sinensis  (orange), Silybum \nmarianum  (thistle ), Quassia amara  (quassia), Baccharis articulata  \n(carqueja), Peumus boldus  (boldo), Cynara scolymus  (artichoke), \nVerbena bonariensis  (verbena), Schinopsis balansae  (quebracho, \nrich in polyphenols) and Ribes nigrum  (cassis). We determined AO \nby DPPH assay. Hep-G2 cells were treated with 15 mM AP and HE \nfor 24h. After these treatments, we evaluated cytotoxicity by MTT \nassay, ALT and AST activities. In HE-treated AD, we assessed cho -\nlesterol (Chol) and triglyceride (Tg) levels. Results: The highest HE \nAO/mg were 88 + 5% (orange, OE), 74 + 1% (carqueja, CE), 70 \n+ 2% (quebracho, QE) and 68 + 4% (cassis, CsE). CsE was toxic \nto Hep-G2 cells, but CsE treatment on AD resulted in a significant \ndecrease in Chol (by 31%) and Tg (by 62%) levels, without toxic \neffects. AP treatment was toxic to Hep-G2 cells and increased by 3 \nfolds AST and ALT activities compared to non-treated control cells \n(p<0.01). OE, CE and QE treatments produced a significant percent -\nage reduction in hepatic enzyme activities compared to AP treated \ncells (p<0.01); ALT decrease: 30 + 5, 34 + 1 and 62 + 3, respectively; \nAST decrease: 26 + 2, 19 + 1 and 35 + 1, respectively. The rest of \nHE with low AO, such as boldo (34 + 2%), could not decrease ALT \nor AST activities. Conclusion: Only non-toxic HE with high AO could \nachieve hepatic protector effect. Just QE could decrease ALT and \nAST activities to similar values of those of NAC. \n161.

However, the combination of IFN-\u03b1 with other \nanti-cancer drugs, have had promising results. Vitamin K2 is present \nin dairy products and has been recommended as a micronutrient \nsupplement in humans. Several studies have indicated that vitamin \nK2, may play a role in controlling the growth of HCC . Objective: to \nevaluate if the therapy of IFN-\u03b1-2b with vitamin K2 has a synergistic \ninhibitory action on DEN-induced carcinogenesis in mice. Methods \nand Results: 14-day-old mice were injected ip with 25 mg/kg DEN \n(control group with tumor, CT). After 10 months mice were divided \ninto 4 groups: CT; IFN: CT mice that received IFN-\u03b1-2b 6.5x105U/\nkg ip 5 times/week/3 weeks; VK2: CT mice that received vitamin K2 \n5 mg/kg ip 5 times/week/3 weeks; and IFN+VK2: CT mice which \nreceived both drugs. Animals were euthanized after treatments and \nlivers were obtained. There were no differences in body and liver/\nbody weight ratio between groups. CT mice treated with IFN-\u03b1-2b \nhad fewer tumors/liver and a trend to be smaller in size. VK2 and \nIFN+VK2 groups did not show differences respect to CT in number \nand size tumors. Immunoblot analysis showed increase proapoptot -\nic Bax protein in IFN and decrease expression in IFN+VK2 groups \n(+51%* and -41%* respectively) respect to the CT group. PCNA pro -\ntein expression showed a decrease (-60%*) in IFN group respect to \nCT. Finally, immunoblotting showed increase E-cadherin expression \nin IFN and VK2 groups (+290%* and +145%* respectively) and no \ndifferences in N-cadherin protein expression between all the studied \ngroups. (*p<0.05vsCT). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that IFN-\n\u03b1-2b, but not vitamin K2, contributes to reducing liver cancer in mice \ntreated with DEN. Moreover, VK2 blocks the positive effects of IFN-\n\u03b1-2b. This is in agreement with our in vitro  studies in SK-HEP-1 cells \nas well as with our studies performed in in the early stages of liver \ncancer development in ratsMEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

Three of them went through se -\nvere protein malnutrition and renourished with an experimental diet \ncontaining 20% of casein according to AIN93 (Re-nourished group \n= RN: R, RE, REX). Well-nourished controls (WN: C, CE, CEX) re -\nceived animal stock diet since weaning. \u03b1-T was administered for 42 \ndays in the diet and as a supplement in drinking water. The RE and \nCE groups received in the drinking water, \u03b1-T equivalent to +4.5% \nand REX and CEX +45% of the intake from the diet. Liver \u03b1-T and \n\u03b3-T levels were determined by HPLC; lipid oxidation by TBARS as -\nsay and protein oxidation by carbonyl groups quantification. Results \nwere expressed as the Mean \u00b1 S.E. Statistics: One-way ANOVA.\nRN presented higher \u03b1-T and lower \u03b3-T liver levels than the WN \ngroups (39\u00b110 vs. 23\u00b15 and 1,0\u00b10,1 vs. 1,6\u00b10,2 \u00b5g/g tissue, respec -\ntively; p<0,05), even though the 20% casein diet ingested by RN \nanimals contained twice as much \u03b3-T as the stock diet received by \nWN.

The aim of this study was to analyze the pre -\nventive effect of 8 weeks metformin therapy over sodium excretion, \nsystolic blood pressure (SBP), and renal tissue integrity in male \nSprague-Dawley rats under HFD. The animals (body weight of 180-\n200 gr) were randomized on 4 groups (n=4/each one): control (C, \nstandard diet and tap water to drink), HFD (C + 50% w/w fat added \nto C diet), control+metformin (CM, C + 500mg/kg/day of metformin \ndiluted in the water), HFD+metformin (HFDM, HFD+CM). Results: \nMetformin improved fractional sodium excretion (FENa%, HFDM: 0.34\u00b10.09 vs HFD: 0.16\u00b10.02; p<0.05), urinary sodium excretion \n(UNa.V, mEq/24hs, HFDM: 0.86\u00b10.13 vs HFD: 0.45\u00b10.06; p<0.02), \nand SBP (mmHg, HFDM: 128\u00b11 vs HFD: 138\u00b12; p<0.02). Daily \nurine excretion and GFR showed no variation during the studied \nperiod between HFDM vs HFD. Body weight, triglyceridemia and \nglycemia were also improved by metformin comparing HFDM vs \nHFD (p<0.01 for each), while hyperinsulinemia induced by HFD was \nnot significantly modified under metformin treatment. Histological \nanalysis with H&E stain showed that metformin treatment reduced \nintracytoplasmatic inclusions in the tubular cortex cells of HFD; while \nPicrus Sirius red showed that metfomin could not prevent the inter -\nstitial fibrosis observed in HFD; but transmission electron micros -\ncopy showed a minor foot processes effacement in HFDM vs HFD, \nimproving glomerular structure. In conclusion: Metformin showed \nbeneficial effects by improving fractional and urinary sodium excre -\ntion, SBP and renal tubular and glomerular structure and ultrastruc -\nture in this experimental model.\n164.

After, half of \nthe rats were fed with an SRD containing chia seed as a source of \nfat instead of corn oil for 3 months (SRD+chia group). The other half \ncontinued with the SRD until 6 months (SRD group). The reference \ngroup consumed a standard chow diet through the experimental pe -\nriod (RD group). In all dietary groups were assessed: 1-Glucose and \ntriglyceride serum levels and the weight of perirenal adipose tissue. \nIn the renal cortex: 2-Content of triglycerides (TG); 3-the activity \nof key enzymes of de novo lipogenesis: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase \n(ACC), fatty-acyl-CoA synthase (FAS) and glucose-6-phosphate \ndehydrogenase (G6PD); 4-the activity of key enzymes of glucone -\nogenesis: Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), fructose-bisphospha -\ntase (FBPase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). \nThe statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA. P values lower \nthan 0.05 were considered statistically different.\nResults: Compared with the SRD group, the SRD+chia group dis -\nplays a significant decrease of perirenal adipose tissue (p<0.05) and \na lowering of TG levels in both serum and renal tissue (p<0.05). In the \nrenal cortex of this dietary group a significative decrease (p<0.05) of \nACC, FAS, and G6PD was observed. Besides, the normalization of \nglycemia  in the SRD+chia group was related to a significant reduc -\ntion of the activity of FBPase and PEPCK reaching values similar to \nthose observed in the RD. No change in G6Pase activity (p>0.05) \nwas observed between SRD and SRD+chia groups.\nConclusion: The results achieved suggest that chia seeds could be \na beneficial nutrient to counteract the renal alterations of MS.\n165. (144) ACTION OF IODINE AS AN ANTAGONIST OF THE \nTHYROID DISRUPTING ACTION EXERTED BY NITRATES \nPRESENT IN GROUNDWATER.\nMar\u00eca Fernanda, Rodrigo, Pablo, Osvaldo Juan Modarelli, \nBilbao, Schacchi y Ponzo, Mar\u00eca Fernanda Modarelli \nLaboratorio de Endocrinolog\u00eda. Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eca. Facul -\ntad de Medicina. UBA.\nRecently we have demonstrated that nitrates present in groundwa -ABSTRACTS95\nter exert a disruptive action. Nitrates could compete with Iodine for \nthyroid cotransporter NIS, being amphibian larvae highly sensitive \nto this effect. Objectives: evaluate the antagonistic action of iodine \nand groundwater contaminated with nitrates on metamorphosis, \nmorphological and histological changes in amphibian. Materials and \nmethod: Xenopus Laevis larvae at: 22\u00baC \u00b1 2\u00baC, pH: 7 to 7.8 and \nlight-dark cycle: 12hs-12hs, immersed in:  a) filtered drinking water: \ncontrol (C) (n= 5), b) groundwater (G) (n= 8), c) groundwater with \narrested larvae at stage 56NF, to which is added 2.5 \u03bcg/L potas -\nsium iodine (G+I) (n= 8), d) filtered drinking water plus 0.007 mg/L \nof potassium perchlorate: positive control (PC) (n= 8). Results: the \nanalysis of the groundwater used shows a concentration of nitrates \ngreater than 40 mg/L (INTI, National Food Code). The metamorpho -\nsis was completed for: 100% of the C, 37.5% of the G (p<0.001) \n(RR: infinity), 62.5% of the G+I (p<0.01), (RR: 0.67) and 0% of the \nPC (p<0.0001), (RR: infinity) (CI: 95%). The total metamorphosis \ntime was: C: 52\u00b11, G: 65\u00b12, G+I: 54\u00b11 days (p<0.001), CI: 95%. \nWeight and height showed significant decreased in the 58NF stage \nin group G and G+I vs C and PC (p<0.01) CI: 95%. In stage 66NF \nfor weight there were no differences (p<0.05), the height was signifi -\ncantly decreased for the group G and G+I vs C (p<0.02), CI: 95%. \nHistologically (58NF) the colloidal area increase: G+I vs G, PC and \nC (p<0.001), CI: 95%; and increases epithelial height G and G+I vs \nPC and C (p<0.001), CI: 95%.The follicular hyperplasia grade was in \nG, G+I and PC: 2 and in C: 0 (p<0.001) CI: 95%. Conclusion: During \nmetamorphosis, morphological and histological changes regulated \nby thyroid hormones are affected by action of nitrates present in \ngroundwater; these effects could be reversed in the amphibian, by \nthe action of iodine.\n166.

Atorvastatin and Metformin could improve \ncellular functionality by restoring the redox state and inflammatory \nprocess, preventing MS lesions. Objective: An experimental model \nof MS assessed the pharmacological response of atorvastatin and \nmetformin over inflammation and OS biomarkers. Materials and \nmethods: 40 male Wistar rats were used (8 per group): A)Control, \nB)SM, C)SM+Atorvastatin, D)SM+Metformin, and E)SM+Atorvastat -\nin+Metformin. SM was induced by 10% fructose in drinking water \nduring 6 weeks. Atorvastatin was administered in doses equivalent \nto 10 mg and metformin in doses equivalent to 500 mg, during 45 \ndays. Fibrinogen (mg/dL), nitric oxide (NO)(\u00b5M) and superoxide \ndismutase (SOD)(U/mL) were quantified by spectrophotome -\ntry. The results were analyzed with ANOVA and hotelling as a post \nhoc test, p significance level<0.05. Results: Fibrinogen concentra -\ntion increased in (B)(288.83 \u00b16.8) with respect to (A)(203.33 \u00b16.8)\n(p<0.001), and in groups (C)(A) 196 \u00b17.45), (D)(242 \u00b17.45) and (E)\n(104,33 \u00b16,8) a diminution of fibrinogenemia was evident(p<0.001). \nLevels of NO significantly decreased in (B)(14.76 \u00b11.86) compared to \n(A)(27.09 \u00b11.95)(p<0.001) and normalized their levels in the groups \n(C)(25.48 \u00b12.06), (D)(22.2 \u00b12,33) and (E)(31.25 \u00b12,18)(p<0,001). SOD activity in (B)(178.64 \u00b110.23) increased significantly contrast -\ned with (A)(134.5 \u00b110.73)(p<0.001), similar response evidenced in \n(D)(195.71 \u00b112,82) and (E)(222,17 \u00b115.17)(p<0.001), however in \ngroup (C)(145.71 \u00b112.82) there was a significant decreased from (B)\n(p<0.001). Conclusion: Atorvastatin exhibited its pleiotropic effects \nby normalizing biomarkers. Metformin improves the inflammatory \nand OS profile by enhancing the activity of the antioxidant system. \nCombined administration demonstrated pharmacological synergy \nby producing regression of OS and inflammatory state.\n167.

However, the \ngreat amount of fiber provides functional properties and bread made \nwith this flour, can be a product that could help to maintain a healthy \ndiet. \nObjective: the aim of this work was to study the effect of the intake \nof bread with lentil flour  during 60 days, on calcium absorption and \nbiomechanical parameters, using a Wistar rat model. \nMethods: animals were divided in three groups (n=8/group) and fed \nafter weaning with different diets: control (C) according to AIN 93, \ndiet containing lentil flour (LF) and diet with wheat and lentil flour \nbread (80:20%) (LFB). During the last five days of the experience, \nfood intake was recorded and feces were collected to calculate Ap -\nparent calcium absorption (APCa%). At the end of the study, rats \nwere anesthetized  and the cecum from each animal was excised, \nsplit open, and the pH of the cecal content was measured. Right \nfemur was also excised and Limit elastic load (Wy), Diaphyseal stiff -\nness (Wy Dy) and Maximum fracture load (Wf max) were measured.\nResults: the results showed that the cecal content of LF and LFB \npresented a lower pH than C (6.39\u00b10.14 vs 6.52\u00b10.19 vs 7.13\u00b10.14; \np< 0.0001 ). ApCa% were lower in LFB compared with LF and C  \n(68,0\u00b16,4 vs 69,1\u00b17,4 vs 73,6\u00b12,8; p<0.05 ). Values of Wy were \nsignificantly higher in groups LF and LFB than in C ( 147,2\u00b113,5 \nvs 137,2\u00b125,9 vs 102,8\u00b115,4; p<0.01 ) as well as results of Wy Dy \n( 268,2\u00b129,1 vs 260,5\u00b139 vs189,9\u00b126,9 ; p<0.001 ).

MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 202096\nThe MTP inhibitor lomitapide binds directly to MTP thereby inhibiting \nthe synthesis of triglyceride-rich VLDL in the liver. Therefore, the ob-\njective  of this work was to study the effect of MTP inhibition on tumor \ndevelopment. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a model \nof chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. Animals were randomly divided \ninto two groups (5 mice/group). One group (Control) received ve -\nhicle (methylcellulose, gastric probe) and another group received \n5 mg/kg bw/day lomitapide (gastric probe) for 3 weeks. At the end \nof the treatment, mice were sacrificed, livers were excised and \nweighed and tumors on the liver surface were counted. After treat -\nment, lomitapide-treated mice showed increased liver/body weights \nratio (2-fold) and higher number of tumors (2-fold) than control mice. \nAs expected, plasma levels of triacylglycerol and ApoB-100 were \ndecreased (-40% and -60%, respectively) in lomitapide-treated mice \ncompared to control mice. Liver histology analysis showed no differ -\nences between groups on tissue and tumor architecture; however, \nlomitapide-treated mice presented less remaining normal liver pa -\nrenchyma. Conclusion: these studies represent the first steps in the \nevaluation of the role of MTP in cancer development, and demon -\nstrate that MTP may be participating in tumor growth.\n169.

Currently, despite advances in the \nknowledge and therapeutics of MS, the mentioned processes are \npoorly diagnosed and treated in this disease. With the aim of eval -\nuating the effectiveness of resveratrol supplementation on chron -\nic inflammation associated to MS, clinical-biochemical biomarkers \nwere analyzed in the blood of voluntary individuals participating in \nthe study with a diagnosis of MS (n=92). The inclusion criteria were \nmet 22 patients with an average of 68 \u00b1 5 years (13 men, 9 women), \nwhose diagnosis of MS was made based on the diagnostic crite -\nria of the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult treatment \nPanel III, 2002. Patients received a dietary supplement along with \ntheir usual treatment, whose formula is composed of resveratrol \n(50 mg), alpha-tocopherol (25 mg) and piperine (5 mg) for a period \nof 3 months. Piperine increases resveratrol and alpha-tocopherol \nabsorption. Control was the patient himself in baseline conditions, \navoiding interindividual variables and bioavailability of active prin -\nciples. Volunteers were bled before initiation and after 3 months of \ntreatment. Biochemical markers assessed in plasma: glucose, HDL \ncholesterol, triglycerides, ferritin, ultrasensitive C reactive protein \n(CRP); and in neutrophils: oxygen consumption (\u2206O2, evaluated \nusing a Clark type oxygen electrode) and chemiluminescence, de -\ntermined with a photon counter. Results showed: triglycerides de -\ncreased by 25% (p<0.05), ferritin 10% (p<0.05), ultrasensitive CRP \n33% (p<0.0001) in plasma; and in PMN, oxygen consumption de -\ncreased by 55% (p<0.0001) and spontaneous chemiluminescence \n25% (p<0.05) after treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first \nstudy which has been carried out showing that MS patients were \nable to reduce chronic inflammation by the administration of a di -\netary supplement based on resveratrol, alpha-tocopherol and piper -\nine, together with conventional therapy. \n170. (221) EVALUATION OF OXIDATIVE STRESS AND ANTI -\nOXIDANT DEFENSES IN SKELETAL MUSCLE OF DYSLI -PEMIC-INSULIN RESISTANT RATS CHRONICALLY FED A \nSUCROSE-RICH DIET\nHuck SV1, Illesca PI1, D\u2019Alessandro ME1,2.\n1Laboratorio de Estudio de Enfermedades Metab\u00f3licas Rela -\ncionadas con la Nutrici\u00f3n.

In rats chronically fed a su -\ncrose-rich diet (SRD), we previously showed that impaired adipose \ntissue and heart muscle function was associated with lipid accretion, \nincreased OS and depletion of the antioxidant system. However, in \nskeletal muscle (SM), although lipid accumulation was related to in -\nsulin resistance (IR), the participation of OS remains unclear. This \nstudy aimed to explore the possible involvement of OS in the devel -\nopment of IR in SM (gastrocnemius). Male Wistar rats were fed a \nSRD for 6 months (percentage energy: 60 sucrose, 23-corn oil, 17 \nprotein). A reference group consumed a control diet all the time. In \nSM were analyzed: (i) triglycerides (TG), long-chain acyl-CoA (LCA-\nCoA) and diacylglycerol (DAG) content; (ii) OS markers: reactive \noxygen species (ROS) levels and lipoperoxidation as thiobarbituric \nacid reactive substances (TBARS) content; (iii) reduced glutathione \n(GSH) levels. Besides, plasma levels of glucose, TG, free fatty ac -\nids (FFA) and TBARS and whole-body peripheral insulin sensitivity \n(euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp) were measured. Results were \nanalyzed by Student\u00b4s t-test. Chronic administration of SRD signifi -\ncantly increased the accumulation of lipid species in gastrocnemius \nmuscle. Also, dyslipidemia, moderate hyperglycemia, elevated lev -\nels of FFA and IR, characteristics of the experimental model, were \nobserved. In addition, plasma levels of lipoperoxidation (TBARS) \nsignificantly increased in animals that received SRD. Surprisingly, \nthe lipid accretion in SM of SRD-fed rats at this treatment duration \nwas not accompanied by significant changes in the levels of ROS, \nTBARS or GSH. The results reached in the present study expand \nthe current knowledge about the mechanisms underlying diet-in -\nduced lipotoxicity in SM. The link between OS and IR in SM is still \nunder discussion and is an issue to be elucidated in future research.\n171. (242) OFFSPRING BEHAVIOR IS AFFECTED BY FRUC -\nTOSE-INDUCED INSULIN RESISTANCE IN WISTAR RAT \nDAMS\nB\u00e1rbara Judith Gutierrez (INIBIBB-UNS),  Mari\u00e9 Luc\u00eda Cuer -\nvo Sanchez (INIBIBB) , Facundo Heber Prado Spalm (INIBI -\nBB-UNS) , Natalia Edith Furland (INIBIBB-UNS) , Ana Sof\u00eda \nVall\u00e9s (INIBIBB-UNS)\nMaternal nutrition before and during pregnancy plays a critical role \nin fetal brain development. Epidemiological studies have shown an \nassociation between maternal obesity and adverse neurodevelop -\nmental outcomes for offspring. The effects of pregestational insu -\nlin resistance (PIR) on intrauterine programing of fetal brain is a \nlesser-explored area. The goal of this study was to investigate the \nimpact that PIR has on neurodevelopmental reflexes and behavior \nduring adulthood. Offspring behavior was evaluated using open field \n(OF), marble burying, tail flick and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests.  \nWistar adult rats received fructose enriched water (10 % or 20% w/v) \nbefore pregnancy to induce PIR, and during gestation.\nNo modifications on the developmental milestones nor neonates \nsize were observed when comparing offspring of control and PIR \ndams. Smelling, rearing and climbing frequency as well as duration \nduring exploratory behavior testing in the OF test decreased in PIR \ndams progeny. Analysis of minute-by-minute duration in the EPM \nassay evidenced that the PIR group spent more time in the central \nsquare and less in the closed arms compared to control group. Fur -\nthermore, offspring of PIR dams showed a more frequent stretch-at -\ntend posture in the central square. Offspring exposed to maternal \nfructose intake had a greater latency of tail withdraw in the tail flick \ntest and buried more marbles in the marble test.\nWe conclude that maternal exposure before and during gestation \nto fructose does not affect primitive reflexes such as body righting \nmechanisms, coordination, strength, sensory system maturation, ABSTRACTS97\nand labyrinthine reflex. On the contrary, adult rat behavior was sig -\nnificantly altered. Particularly, our results evidence an increment \non anti-anxiety like behavior; longer decision-making time and risk \nassessment. Obsessive-compulsive disorder behavior and altered \nnociception were also noted.\n172.

CONICET\nHigh iron (Fe) intake in carriers of HFE gene mutations (C282Y, \nH63D, S65C) can result in overload and eventually, in hereditary \nhemochromatosis (HH). HH is more common in men than in women. \nC282Y is characteristic of northern Europe, while H63D is in the \nMediterranean countries. European ancestry is estimated to be 81% \nin Buenos Aires city. Therefore, given high meat intake in Argentina, \nancestry and its relationship with possible alterations in Fe metab -\nolism were studied in clinically healthy adult males. 54 male blood \ndonors (20-58 years) attending Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas (UBA) (2018) \nwere enrolled. The daily Fe intake (FeI), heme Fe intake (hem FeI) \nand non-heme FeI intake (non-heme FeI) were evaluated using a \nfood consumption frequency questionnaire (ARGENFOODS and \nUSDA). A genealogical survey was carried out, and ancestry infor -\nmative markers (AIMs) were studied in whole blood using the mul -\ntiplex PCR-APLP technique (30 markers). C282Y, H63D and S65C \nwere investigated in blood by DNA extraction (Accupred Genomics \nDNA Kits) and PCR-RFLP. The FeI, non-heme FeI and heme FeI \nwere, respectively (mg/d): mean \u00b1 SD (range): 22.7 \u00b1 8.6 (9.6-47.2); \n20.7 \u00b1 7.9 (8.3-42.2); 2.0 \u00b1 1.1 (0.3-5.0). Fortified flours (30 mg Fe/\nkg) provided 35.7% of total FeI. The FeI was> 6 mg Fe/d (Estimated \nMean Requirement) in all participants, and 3.0% exceeded the Max -\nimum Tolerable Intake Level (45 mg Fe/d) (NAS, 2001). H63D was \npresent in 13/54 (24%) male donors; only 7/13 (53.8%) answered \nto have a high European self-perceived ancestry. An average Euro -\npean contribution of 83% (range: 99% - 66%) was estimated by the \nAIMs. These results suggest that a significant number of clinically \nhealthy individuals could believe that their European ancestry is few -\ner than that estimated by a genetic analysis. Therefore, they could \nbe at risk of Fe accumulation given feeding habits in Argentina (55.5 \nKg meat /per c\u00e1pita/y, FAO 2013, and Ley 25630/2002).

Since \nobesity and other associated metabolic disorders have reached ep -\nidemic proportions, potential therapeutic strategies targeting AT are of main research interest. We have previously shown that Salvia \nhispanica  L. (chia) seed was able to reduce the increased visceral \nadiposity and improve the altered insulin sensitivity (IS) present in \nrats chronically fed a sucrose-rich diet (SRD). The aim of this work \nwas to evaluate the effect of chia seed on the morphology and key \nmolecules of insulin signaling pathway and lipolysis in different vis -\nceral AT depots of SRD-fed rats. Male Wistar rats were fed a SRD \nfor 3 months. Half of the animals continued with the SRD until month \n6, the other half was fed a SRD in which the fat source, corn oil, was \nreplaced by chia seed from month 3 to 6 (SRD+chia). Another group \nconsumed a reference diet all the time. We analyzed: body weight \n(BW), energy intake and visceral adiposity index (VAI). In epididymal \n(eAT) and retroperitoneal adipose tissue (rAT):  fat cell size, fat cell \nnumber and lipid content, total hormone sensitive lipase \u2013HSL- and \nAKT protein mass levels (Western Blot). IS (euglycemic\u2013hyperin -\nsulinemic clamp) and serum glucose, insulin, triglycerides and FFA \nlevels were also determined. The addition of chia seed to SRD-fed \nrats: a-significantly decreased (p<0.05) the increased VAI, although \nBW and energy intake was similar to those of the SRD-fed rats, \nb- In both eAT and rAT: reduced (p<0.05) the increased fat cell size \nand lipid content and decreased (p<0.05) the HSL protein levels. No \nchanges were observed in eAT and rAT AKT protein mass levels. \nBesides, chia seed corrected the moderate hyperglycemia, dyslipid -\nemia and IS.

Centro de Endocrinolog\u00eda Experimental y Aplicada (CENE -\nXA) (CONICET \u2013 UNLP). \nIt is widely accepted that diet quality supply during gestation pro -\ngrams pup\u00b4s development. Our aim was to evaluate the impact \nof fructose rich diet (FRD) intake in adult females whose mothers \nconsumed FRD during pregnancy. For this purpose o n pregnancy \nday 1, dams were provided either with tap water alone or contain -\ning fructose (10% w/v; FRD) and fed ad libitum  with chow up to \ndelivery. Weaned female pups were maintained until 60-days old \nwith normal diet ad libitum . Randomly, one group of pups was sac -\nrificed (C and F considering maternal diet) and the remaining were \nsplit into two subgroups: one received normal diet (CC and FC) and \nthe other FRD (CF and FF) for three weeks. Body weight (BW) and \ncaloric intake (CI) were recorded from day 21 until 81 of age, data \nwere analyzed by split plot ANOVA. At both sacrifice days (60 and \n81) blood was collected and retroperitoneal adipose tissue (RPAT) \nwas excised and weighed. T-tests were performed for 60 day\u00b4s \nresults and 2-way ANOVA for 81 ones (programming and diet as \nvariables). At age 60 days, F females only showed differences in \nCI in an age x programming dependent manner, with lower CI than \nC rats as age increases, but no metabolic changes were seen. At \n81 days, all groups increased their BW in an age dependent man -\nner, but programming and adult diet increased it even more. CI in -\ncreased by FRD, showing FF rats the highest CI among groups. \nWhile plasma glucose levels did not vary, insulin increased by adult \nFRD. Triglycerides levels in FF animals were the highest, over all \nother groups. Moreover, programming by FRD induced higher levels \nof leptin in line with higher RPAT mass. In conclusion, FRD intake \nduring pregnancy induces a programming effect on female litters, \ninstalled at age 81 days. Indeed, because maternal FRD intake ef -\nfect appeared, the unbalanced diet consumption seems to trigger a \nmetabolic misprogramming in adulthood. This effect could probably \nbe due to the in utero  high FRD pups\u2019 exposure. PICT 2017-2334\n175.

Toxicity is associated with oxidative damage \n(OD) on biomolecules  mediated by the generation of reactive oxy -\ngen species, mainly hydroxyl radical and organic hydroperoxides. \nThe objective of this work is to assess whether OD due to chronic \noverload of Cu(II) in rats involves changes in redox homeostasis in \nheart (H) and the effect of vitamin E (Vit.E) on it prevention. Male \nSprague Dawley rats (80-90 g) received standard diet and drinking \nwater with 0.5 g/L Cu(II) (0.05%w/v, n=36) as CuSO4 for 21 days, and \nVit.E (100 mg/day, 5 g/kg food) over 5 days before Cu(II) overload. \nThe following parameters were assessed in tissue homogenates: \nprotein oxidation, measured as carbonyl groups (CO), phospholipid \noxidation, measured as the content of thiobarbituric acid reactive \nsubstances (TBARS) and NADPH oxidase activity. In mitochondria, \nthe oxygen consumption (\u2206O2) was measured with a Clark-type ox -\nygen electrode. A 7-fold increase of CO was observed with Cu(II) \noverload (day 14, p<0.001), whereas Vit.E prevented protein oxi -\ndation (decreased 91% CO before Cu(II) treatment). Rats which re -\nceived Vit.E or combined Vit.E and Cu(II) treatments for 21 days and \nshowed lower levels of TBARS in the organ (30%, p<0.01 and 20%, \np<0.05, respectively). NADPH oxidase activity decreased 100% with \nCu(II) (day 7, p<0.001), 56%  (day 14, p<0.001) and 45% (day 21, p<0.05). NADPH oxidase activity decreased with Vit.E (76%, day \n7, p<0.01; and 36%, day 14, p<0.05) with Vit.E (p<0.001), and the \ncombined treatment, decreased this complex enzyme 60% at days \n7 and 14 (p<0.001). Cu(II) treatment decreased \u2206O2 (27%, day 7, \np<0.05) and combined treatment 33% (p<0.01), 69% (p<0.01) and \n18% (p<0.5) from day 7 to 21. Results indicate that Cu(II) chronic \noverload induces cytosolic, membrane and mitochondrial protein ox -\nidation in heart which impairs their biological function whereas Vit.E \nprotects cytosolic proteins.\n177. (393) ASSESSMENT OF SODIUM INTAKE OF YOUNG \nADULTS IN A 3-YEAR STUDY \nDiaz S, Cueto MR, Fernandez I, Vidueiros SM, Pallaro A\nUniversidad de Buenos Aires, Facultad de Farmacia y Bio -\nqu\u00edmica, C\u00e1tedra de Nutrici\u00f3n\nElevated sodium intake is related to NCDs such as hypertension \nand cardiovascular diseases, being a huge public health problem. \nAim of the study: to assess the sodium intake of young adults in \na 3-year study. 754 university students (571 women, 183 men), \naged 26\u00b15 years, were studied from 2017 to 2019. A spot urine was \nobtained to determine Na, K by direct ISE and creatinine by Jaff\u00e9 \nmethod. INTERSALT and Tanaka prediction equations were used to \nestimate 24-h urinary sodium excretion (24-hUNa,mg/d). Spot urine \nNa/K ratio was calculated. Throughout the 3-year study, 24-hUNa \nestimated by both equations pointed out an increased sodium di -\netary intake in more than 70% of women and 80% of men, exceed -\ning WHO recommendation of 2 g/day. Na/K ratio was >1 in 90% \nof students. 24-hUNa estimated by INTERSALT was significantly \nhigher in men than in women in 2018 and 2019 (2916.8\u00b1760.2 vs \n2202.5\u00b1542.3; 2929.9\u00b1811.3 vs 2260.7\u00b1570.8; p<0.001). However, \nit was only significantly higher in men compared to women in 2018 \nwhen Tanaka was used (2888.3\u00b1896.5 vs 2608.4\u00b1761.3; p<0.03). \n24-hUNa of women estimated by Tanaka was significantly higher \ncompared to INTERSALT (2017: 2754.3\u00b1829.8 vs 2265.5\u00b1589.4; \n2018: 2608.4\u00b1761.3 vs 2202.5\u00b1542.3; 2019: 2835.0\u00b1901.8 vs \n2260.7\u00b1570.8; p<0.001). In men, a significant difference was only \nobserved in 2017 (2867.0\u00b1793.2 vs 2091.0\u00b1941.1; p<0.001). There \nwas no difference in 24-hUNa of women estimated by INTERSALT \nalong the 3 years. However, 24-hUNa of men was lower in 2017 \ncompared to 2018 and 2019 (2091.0\u00b1941.1 vs 2916.8\u00b1760.2 and \n2929.9\u00b1811.3; p<0.001). When Tanaka was used, there was no dif -\nference in 24-hUNa of men along the study, but in women it was \nlower in 2018 than 2019 (p<0.05). Regardless of the used prediction \nequation, an excess in sodium intake was observed in young adults \nover time, being a risk factor for NCDs. Usually men\u2019s sodium intake \nwas higher than women\u2019s. Tanaka seems to predict higher 24-hUNa \nvalues than INTERSALT, mainly in women. \n178.

C\u00e1tedra de Matem\u00e1tica, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00ed -\nmica, UBA.\nAcute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) is caused by an hereditary dis -\norder of heme biosynthesis, produced by a decrease in the activity \nof porphobilinogen deaminase, associated with an increase in the \nexpression of the regulatory enzyme of this pathway, d-aminolevulic \nsynthetase 1 (ALAS1), accumulating the neurotoxic precursor d-mi-\nnolevulic acid (ALA) generating recurrent and intense seizures with \nneurological involvement.\nCarbohydrate treatment rapidly reduces ALA production; the ther -\napeutic effect is related to the ability of both glucose and insulin \nto modulate ALAS1 activity. Decreased levels of insulin-like growth \nfactor 1 (IGF1) may alter the metabolism of specific carbohydrates \nand lipids, altering the flow of nutrients to the liver.ABSTRACTS99\nAs IGF1 acts complementary to insulin, we decided to evaluate IGF1 \nlevels and its relationship with heme metabolism in an AIP patients.\nIn a population of 82 genetically diagnosed individuals, the biochem -\nical parameters (BP) of AIP: ALA, porphobilinogen (PBG) and total \nporphyrins (TP) and the IGF1 levels were measured. Three groups \nwere classified according to symptoms: Latent (L): no symptoms; \nManifested (M): presented attack and BP values returned to normal; \nSubclinical Manifested (SM): presented attack and their BP values \nremained elevated.\nTo compare the BP and IGF1 levels between L, M and SM groups, \nthe variables were categorized as: IGF1-n (normal) and IGF1-l (low) \nand for the BP: ALA, PBG and TP as normal and elevated.\nThere is only a significant association in the SM group (p = 0.0029): \n84% of the patients have elevated ALA / IGF1-l and when we verify \nthe relation between IGF1 with the three high BP simultaneously, \nthe SM group shows a significant association (p = 0.008): 80% of \npatients with IGF1-l have the three BP high.

However, there are other derivatives such as \nfats from these animals, which are discarded and could be used as \nsources of natural oils with potential applications in food. In recent \nyears, the demand for natural oils by the industry has increased, \nseeking natural alternatives, especially when we mention fatty acids \n(FA) of \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 families whose relationship can have differ -\nent effects on health. The objective was to obtain caiman oil from \nfatty deposits of Caiman latirostris  for its potential use as a dietary \nsupplement. Oil was extracted from fat by melting at 60 \u00b0C. The \nFA profile was analyzed by gas chromatography. Oxidative stability \nwas evaluated through peroxide index (PI), anisidine index (AI) and \nKreiss index (KI). A microbiological study was carried out on the oil, \nwhich showed absence of total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, total \ncoliform bacteria, Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The FA profile \nshowed high content of oleic acid (33.4%) and linoleic acid (28.8%). \nLikewise, the presence of 2% \u03b1-linolenic acid was evidenced. The PI \nvalues   were kept below 6 meq O2 / Kg oil, while KI was negative and \nAI   was not detectable. Since the consumption of a product derived \nfrom caiman fat is not part of the usual diet of the population, it was \nessential to choose a reliable analytical methodology with high per -\nformance, high oxidative and hydrolytic stability, without microbial \nload and with nutritional quality and low cost. Nutritionally, obtained \ncaiman oil results in an excellent source of essential FA, being a \nhealthy and sustainable alternative that could be incorporated as \npart of the human diet.\nids\n180. (503)  ANTHOCYANINS AS INHIBITORS OF \u03b1-GLUCOSI -\nDASE AND PANCREATIC LIPASE ACTIVITY\nMosele JI, Galleano M, Fraga CG\nFisicoqu\u00edmica, Fac. de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad \nde Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina; CONICET- Uni -versidad de Buenos Aires (IBIMOL), Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nFood components providing glucose and fat-lowering effects in the \nbody can be useful to attenuate the negative health effects associat -\ned to high-carbohydrates and/or high-fat diets. Here, anthocyanins \nwere studied as potential inhibitors of \u03b1-glucosidase (\u03b1-G) and pan -\ncreatic lipase (PL) activities, two key enzymes responsible for car -\nbohydrates and fats digestion. The anthocyanin profile of extracts \nobtained from bilberry (BB), blackcurrant (BC) and black rice (BR) \nwas characterized. The capacity of extracts, pure anthocyanins, \nand mixtures (representative of anthocyanin extracts composition) \nto inhibit the activity of  \u03b1-G and PL was evaluated using enzymat -\nic assays, including acarbose and orlistat as positive controls for \n\u03b1-G and PL, respectively. In a concentration range of 20-320 \u03bcg/\nmL, extracts showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effects on \u03b1-G ac -\ntivity. The calculated IC50 were 87 \u00b1 7, 76 \u00b1 7 and 236 \u00b1 25 \u03bcg/mL \nfor BB, BC and BR, respectively. Some pure anthocyanins showed \ninhibitory actions (cyanidin-3- O-glucoside\u02c3delphinidin-3- O-gluco -\nside\u02c3petunidin-3- O-glucoside) whereas the mixtures were ineffec -\ntive at the assayed range concentration. In a broader concentration \nrange (0-2000 \u03bcg/mL), extracts did not show significant inhibition \non porcine PL activity, but most of the pure anthocyanins were ef -\nfective (petunidin-3- O-glucoside\u02c3cyanidin-3- O-glucoside\u02c3delphini -\ndin-3- O-glucoside\u02c3malvidin-3- O-glucoside). No inhibition was ob -\nserved for peonidin-3- O-glucoside and mixtures of compounds. In \nsummary, anthocyanins would contribute only marginally to the in \nvitro \u03b1-G inhibition. Regarding PL activity, their inhibitory capacity \nwas reduced when present in extracts or mixtures, suggesting com -\nplex interactions with other components under the in vitro used con -\nditions. In vivo studies are needed to confirm the effects of extracts/\npure anthocyanins on enzymatic activities observed here.

Short-chain \nfatty acids (SCFA) produced by gut microbiota, could provide bene -\nficial effects in attenuating endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory \nresponse associated with metabolic diseases.The aim of this work \nwas to evaluate select s hort chain fatty acids (SCFA) on the Ox -\nLDL-induced NLRP3 activation in aorta by using an ex-vivo model. \nThoracic aortas from male Sprague Dawley rats were cut in rings, \nand incubated with OxLDL (0-200 mg/ml) or vehicle for 0-120 min. \nAt the end of the incubation periods, expression of proteins (NLRP3, \nprocaspase-1, caspase-1, pro-IL1beta, TNFalpha) and detection of \n4-hidroxinonenal adducts (4HNE) were measured by western blot in \nthe aorta rings , and interleukin levels (IL1beta and IL18) by ELISA \nin the incubation media. OxLDL produced modifications in all the \nmeasured parameters, with different time-course and degree of re -\nsponse. The earliest responses (10 min) were observed for NLRP3 \nexpression in aorta (increments of 25, 125, and 100% for 50, 100 \nand 200 mg/ml OxLDL, respectively p<0.05, compared to vehicle) , \nand for IL18 levels in the incubation media (increments of 128, 200, \nand 300% for 50, 100 and 200 mg/ml OxLDL, respectively p<0.05, \ncompared to vehicle). To evaluate SCFA effect on this model, be -\nfore treatment with OxLDL, aortic rings were pre-incubated with 10 \nmM butyrate, propionate, or acetate. Preincubation with each SCFA \nprevented OxLDL-induced modifications in different parameters: \nacetate prevented IL18 increased (-32%, p<0.05), butyrate prevent -\ned TNFalpha increased (-21%, p<0.05), and propionate prevented \nonly 4HNE detection. In conclusion, OxLDL activates NLRP3 inflam -\nmasome in isolated aorta, and the assayed SCFA inhibited that ac -\ntivation at different levels of the inflammasome cascade.

Hospital General de Ni\u00f1os Pedro de Elizalde.\n \nShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli  is responsible for Hemolytic \nUremic Syndrome (HUS), a cause of renal failure in children. We \nhave previously shown that C-9 and Eliglustat (EG), inhibitors of glu -\ncosylceramide synthase and globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), prevent \nthe cytotoxic effects of Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2), in human cortical \nrenal tubular epithelial cells (HRTEC) primary cultures and HK2 cell \nline. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of EG, eluci -\ndating EG treatments necessary to achieve total protection against \nStx2 in HRTEC and HK2. Cells were incubated with Stx2 (1 ng/ml, \n24 and 72 h) and pre-incubated with or without EG (1-500 nM, 6 \nand 24 h), followed by co-incubation with same dilutions of EG and \nStx2 (24 and 72 h). Total number of cells stained with Hoechst was \ncounted in microphotographs and compared with cell viability mea -\nsured by neutral red uptake. Early and late apoptosis and necrosis \nwas evaluated by annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Tubulogen -\nesis was evaluated in HRTEC grown on matrigel. Treatment of cells \nwith Stx2 significantly decreased cell confluence and viability and \nthe number of cells attached (p<0.001). In HRTEC, Stx2 increased \nearly and late apoptosis, and necrosis compared to non-treated cells \n(p<0.01). Furthermore, Stx2 inhibited cell aggregation and tubulo -\ngenesis on matrigel. HRTEC preincubated with EG (50 nM, 24 h or \n500 nM, 6 h) totally prevented Stx2 effects on HRTEC measured as \ncell count, viability, apoptosis, necrosis and tubulogenesis (p<0.05). \nPreincubation of HK2 cells with EG (1 nM, 24 h or 10 nM, 6 h) totally \nprevented Stx2 effects on cell viability and confluence. EG alone did \nnot produce cytotoxic effects per se . In conclusion, EG protects hu -\nman renal tubular epithelium against Stx2 cytotoxicity being HRTEC \nmore sensitive than HK2. Treatment with EG could be a novel sub -\nstrate inhibition therapy to neutralize Stx2 action and prevent renal \ndamage in patients with HUS. Study supported by PUE0041, CON -\nICET.\n183.

It was reported that inhibition of \nnitric oxide (NO) by Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2) enhanced renal dam -\nage in mice and baboon models of Stx-mediated HUS. The aim of \nthe work was to study the evolution of the damages caused by Stx2 \nin P compare with NP rats. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats, at day \n8 of gestation, and NP rats were ip inoculated with 0.5 ng Stx2/g \nbody weight (PS, NPS) or diluent (PC, NPC). Some PS and PC \nrats were treated with 1mg/ml L-NAME, NO inhibitor, in drinking \nwater (PLS, PLC) from 24h before ip injection to 4 days post-in -\njection (dpi). Rats were individually housed, checked for water and \nfood intake, and weighted every 24h until 30 dpi. At 4 dpi, blood \nand 24h-urine samples were collected to determine urinary flow and \nfree water clearance (CH20). Then, rats were euthanized and kidneys \nwere removed for histopathological observations. NPS and PS rats \nshowed a decrease in food intake and weight with respect to controls \n(p<0.05). PS rats increased food intake and recovered weight at 5 \ndpi, while NPS rats showed an improvement at 14 dpi. The water \nintake increased in NPS and PS rats compared to controls until 7 dpi \n(p<0.05). In NPS at 4 dpi, the rise in water intake coincided with an \nincrease in urinary flow and CH20 respect to NPC (p<0.05), different from what was observed in PS. The renal cortex of NPS presented \nsignificantly more necrosis and atrophied tubules than PS (p<0.05). \nPreliminary results in PLS rats showed that L-NAME significantly \nincreased renal necrosis compared with PLS and PLC rats (p<0.05). \nIn conclusion, PS rats suffered less renal damage and recovered \nfrom the Stx2 effect faster than NPS rats. L-NAME increased Stx2 \neffect in PLS suggesting that physiology changes caused by preg -\nnancy, like increasing in NO production, may contribute to protect \nmaternal kidney from Stx2 effects. \n184. (359) MOLECULAR MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN RENAL \nALTERATIONS TRIGGERED BY ENDOTHELIN INHIBI -\nTION IN THE RAT DURING THE POSTNATAL PERIOD\nMarinoni, RC1; Oronel, LH1; Yarza, C1; Ortiz, MC1; Albertoni \nBorghese, MF1 and Majowicz, MP1\n1. C\u00e1tedra de Biolog\u00eda Celular y Molecular, Departamento de \nCiencias Biol\u00f3gicas, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, \nUniversidad de Buenos Aires.\nWe had previously shown that Endothelin (ET) inhibition during the \nearly postnatal period (PNP) with bosentan (20 mg/kg/day), a dual \nET receptor antagonist (ERA), leads to alterations in both ET-1 and \nET receptors expressions in adult rats during a high sodium intake. \nWe had also shown that ET inhibition during PNP increases apopto -\nsis in the kidney and this could be a consequence of an imbalance \nbetween nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2-). It is known that the \ndelicate balance between NO and O2- , besides contributing to devel -\nopment, is important for renal sodium handling.\nThe aim of this work was to evaluate in 7 day old rats (male and \nfemale controls and ERA-treated rats):  renal mitochondrial NO/O2- \nratio, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in different renal structures \nestimated by NADPH-diaphorase technique, renal NOX4, ETA and \nETB expressions by Westernblot and renal pre-pro ET-1 by real time \nPCR. Four experimental groups were studied: control males (Cm), \nmales treated with bosentan (ERAm), control females (Cf) and fe -\nmales treated with bosentan (ERAf). Two-way ANOVA was used for \nstatistics.\nWe found an effect of sex for pre-pro ET-1 expression (p<0.05), be -\ning higher in m than in f and for ETB expression (p<0.02), being \nhigher in f than in m. However ETA/ETB ratio was not significantly \ndifferent between groups. \nOn the other hand, we found a decrease in NADPHd activity in im -\nmature cortical renal structures only in ERAm (p<0. 05) and in mac -\nula densa in both ERAm and ERAf vs their controls (p<0. 05) and \na clear tendency to decrease NO/O2- ratio in ERA-treated animals. \nNOX4 expression also had a tendency to increase in both ERAm \n(0.70 \u00b1 0.18 vs 0.87 \u00b1 0.17) and ERAf (0.64 \u00b1 0.18 vs 0.86 \u00b1 0.06) vs \ntheir respective controls. This tendency could explain the tendency \nto decrease NO/O2- ratio in ERA-treated animals. The expression of \nrenal pre-pro ET-1 and ETB receptor has sex differences in early life \nbut it is not affected by ET inhibition at this stage. \n185.

Laboratorio de Nefrolog\u00eda Experimental y Bioqu\u00edmica Mo -\nlecular, Instituto de Investigaciones M\u00e9dicas Alfredo Lanari, \nFacultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires\nWe have previously demonstrated that 17\u03b2-E stradiol ( 17\u03b2E)  stimu -\nlates cell proliferation through classic estrogen receptors (ER) and \nthe G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER-1), in primary \ncultures of human renal cortical tubular epithelial cells (HRTEC). \nWe also observed that 17\u03b2E decreases the expression of Na+ K+ \nATPase (NKA) in primary cultures. The aim of the present work is to \nstudy the effects of 17\u03b2E on cell proliferation and the expression of \nNKA in a human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line  (HK-2) and \nits comparison with previous results in HRTEC and in studies in vivo  ABSTRACTS101\nwith ovariectomized (oVx) Wistar rats.  HK-2 were treated with 17\u03b2E  \n(10 nM, 24 h)  with or without an agonist (G-1) or an antagonist (G-\n15) of GPER-1. Cell proliferation was measured by bromodeoxyuri -\ndine (BrdU) uptake. The expression of NKA was assayed by western \nblot.  In HK-2, 17\u03b2E stimulated the BrdU uptake (26%) compared \nwith control cells (p<0.05). The treatment of HK-2 with G-15 (100 \nnM) inhibited 17\u03b2E  effect on cell proliferation. The treatment with \nG-1 (1000 nM) inhibited  the BrdU uptake as observed in HRTEC \n(p<0.05).  The treatment of HK-2 with 17\u03b2E and with G-1 (10 nM, 24 \nhs) decreased NKA expression  compared with control cells (p<0.05), \ndemonstrating that estradiol exerts these effects through GPER-1. \nThese results agree with previous studies in HRTEC, where an in -\ncrease of D1DR (dopamine receptor) expression was associated \nwith the decrease of NKA.  These results also match with previous \nstudies in female adult Wistar rats, in which the oVx produced an \nincrease of NKA expression in renal medulla while there was a de -\ncrease of D1DR, both in cortex and medulla. Likewise, hormonal \nreplacement on oVx animals with 17\u03b2E  diminished the expression \nof NKA in renal medulla. In conclusion, our present results show that \nHK-2 cell line can be a valid in vitro  model for better understanding \nof molecular and cellular renal mechanisms regulated by female sex \nhormones like estrogen.\n186.

Laboratory and clinical \nparameters contribute very closely to progression of HUS. To better \nunderstand HUS evolution, the association between a set of labo -\nratory data and a set of clinical parameters of a HUS population is \ninvestigated in this study. \nWe conducted a retrospective study of patients (n = 20) attended \nwith diagnosis of typical HUS in the Pediatric Service of the Hospital \nPosadas from January 2012 to July 2020. 70% were women, with \na mean age of  2.19 year. All laboratory data including those from \nthe emergency department (admission), hospitalization, up to the \nfirst post-discharge check-up by external clinics were standardized \nin innovative report formats.\nWe perform the graphical representation of the evolution over time \nof several of the important clinical parameters (creatinine, hemato -\ncrit, hemoglobin, among others). We find the creatinine curve rele -\nvant with well-defined moments in its evolution: rise, plateau and \ndecline. We emphasize that 50% of the patients present a similar \ndescent slope (- 0.353 +/- 0.022 mg/dL/day) regardless of the max -\nimum value reached by creatinine. Also, analytic platform KNIME \nwas used to evaluate the multivariate relationship between labora -\ntory data and the evolution plasma creatinine values. We observed \na strong correlation between the plasma values   of creatinine-urea \n(positive, r = 0,818) , platelets-uric acid (negative, r = 0,610)  and di -\nrect bilirubin-uric acid (positive r = 0,735).\nThe study should be complemented with the comparison of quali -\ntative variables, as well as with new parameters such as albumin -\nuria, podocyturia, etc.), in order to generate a model of prediction \nof patient evolution during the acute period of HUS the disease and \nafter it.\n187.

After \n6 and 12 weeks, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by \nthe tail cuff method; plasma ANP and BNP levels were determined \nby commercial radioimmunoassay; mRNA expression of receptors \nNPR-A and NPR-C were measured in kidney by RT-PCR; and im -\nmuno-expression of inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and NF-\n\u03baB) and fibrotic biomarker TGF-\u03b2, by immunohistochemistry. Sta -\ntistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA followed by a \nTukey-Kramer test.\nResults:  SBP increased in DS and RV at 6 and 12 weeks \n(mmHg: C6:118+2; DS6:194+2*; RV6:184\u00b12*; C12:121\u00b11; \nDS12:193\u00b14*; RV12:203\u00b14*). Plasma ANP increased in DS \nand RV (pg/mL: C6:170+68; DS6:689+143*; RV6:387\u00b190*; \nC12:87\u00b139; DS12:609\u00b138*; RV12:294\u00b157*), while plasma \nBNP rose only in RV (pg/mL: C6:39\u00b16; RV6:99\u00b18*; C12:42\u00b17; \nRV12:94\u00b110*). mRNA levels of NPR-A (AU, C6:0.096\u00b10.011; \nDS6:0.232\u00b10.015*; C12:0.092\u00b10.020; DS12:0.328\u00b10.039*) and \nNPR-C (AU, C6:0.184\u00b10.020; DS6:0.721\u00b10.131*; C12:0.131\u00b10.026; \nDS12:0.302\u00b10.039*) increased only in DS. All biomarkers increased \nin DS at 6 and 12 weeks (*), while TGF-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 enhanced in \nRV only at 12 weeks (*p<0.05 vs C).\nConclusion:  Results suggest that ANP is a better marker for vol -\nume overload, while BNP level was increased only in the RV mod -\nel. mRNA expression of both NP receptors increased only in DS \nand correlated  with plasma ANP levels. Furthermore, inflammatory \nbiomarkers expression increased faster in kidney DS than in RV, \nsuggesting that volume overload induces earlier inflammation than \npressure overload.\n188.

CONICET.\nErythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone produced primar -\nily in the kidney in response to hypoxic conditions. There is little \ninformation about the role of endogenous EPO in urine. In this re -\ngard, we were pioneering in detecting EPO in rat urine. Cisplatin is \na chemotherapeutic agent broadly used. Its primary dose-limiting \nside effect is nephrotoxicity. The aim of this work was to analyse \nEPO urinary excretion (EPOu) in rats treated with Cisplatin and \ncompare it with traditional and novel markers of renal injury. Male \nWistar rats were treated with different single doses of Cisplatin (2, \n5 and 10 mg/kg b.w., i.p.; Cis2, Cis5 and Cis10, n=4, respective -\nly). A Control group of rats (C, n=4) was processed. After 48 h of \nCisplatin administration plasma and urine samples were collected. \nUrea and creatinine plasma levels (Urp and Crp) and total proteins \nlevels in urine (Pru) were determined spectrophotometrically. EPOu \nand Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGALu) were eval -\nuated by immunoblotting. ANOVA/Newman-Keuls test, P<0.05: a vs \nC; b vs Cis2; c vs Cis5; d vs Cis10.

Urp, Crp and Pru, as \nwell as NGALu were significantly modified only in Cis10 group. In \ncontrast, EPOu was significantly modified at a lower dose of Cispla -\ntin (5 mg/kg), allowing predicting renal perturbation, when no modi -\nfications of other markers of renal injury were still observed. These \nresults could postulate EPOu as a novel early biomarker of cispla -\ntin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Besides, EPOu could contribute \nto create a well-designed panel of biomakers that allows predicting \nrenal injury in Cisplatin treatment.\n189.

Sexual hormones have an important role in the regu -\nlation of renal function and blood pressure in humans and also in \nseveral experimental animal models. We studied the renal response \nto high sodium intake in male Wistar rats either orchidectomized \n(ORX) or ORX supplemented with testosterone (ORX-To).\nMethods. Male Wistar rats were ORX at 60 days of life. At 138 days \nof life, half of them were supplemented with 5 mg testosterone pro -\npionate (s.c. pellets) and the other half remained ORX with choles -\nterol (ORX-cho) as vehicle. During the last 5 days of the study, half \nof rats in each group received normal sodium (NS, NaCl 0.24%) \nor high sodium intake (HS, NaCl 1% in drinking water). Glomeru -\nlar filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), sodium and water \nexcretion and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured. To an -\nalyze the response of renal function upon HS, total alpha 1 subunit \nNa+,K+-ATPase mRNA (Atpa1a) expression by RT-PCR and the \nratio between dephosphorylated and total Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) \nas an activity index  (dNKA/tNKA)  were determined in renal cortex \nand medulla by Western blot.  \nResults. MAP under NS was similar between ORX-cho and ORX-\nTo and did not change upon HS intake. ORX-To rats showed an \nincreased dNKA/tNKA ratio in renal medulla under NS and HS diet \nand a lower cortical Atpa1a than ORX-cho with HS. Sodium and \nwater excretion in ORX-To HS were lower than in ORX-cho HS (both \np<0.05). GFR and RPF increased with HS in ORX-To and ORX-cho \n(both p<0.05), but the increment with To was higher than in ORX-\ncho (p<0.05).\n Conclusion. The retention of sodium and water in To could be the \nconsequence of a more active NKA. Despite sodium and water re -\ntention, MAP remains unchanged probably by a decrease in renal \nvascular resistance. Under HS intake the volume of the extracellular \nfluid and MAP are regulated through renal hemodynamic mecha -\nnisms. These findings provide a better understanding of the effect of \nmale sexual hormones on renal function.\n190.

In this context, the involvement of CD39 and CD73 \nectoenzymes in DN is not entirely clear, but many studies suggest \nthat alterations in the extracellular ATP metabolic machinery trigger \nthe pathophysiology of the disease. Our objective was to identify \nearly markers of glomerular kidney damage and the expression of \nCD39 and CD73 in urine cells of T2DM patients. To this aim, the \nexpressions of nephrin (NEF), podocalyxin (PDX), CD39 and CD73 \nwere evaluated by immunofluorescence (IF) in renal explants and \nin the first morning urine of T2DM patients to determine the detach -\nment of podocytes. In addition, the plasma profile of cytokines was \nanalyzed by LengendPlex and flow cytometry.  The IF revealed that  \nPDX is an exclusive marker for podocytes, while NEF was wide -\nly expressed in tubules and Bowman\u2019s capsule cells. CD39 was \ndetected in vasculature cells and CD73 was located ubiquitously \nin the kidney. Preliminary results showed that T2DM patients pre -\nsented about 2 fold and 3 fold higher frequency of urine NEF+ and \nPDX+ cells, respectively, than control donors. Furthermore, the per -\ncentage of NEF+ and PDX+ cells expressing CD39 in the urine of \nT2DM patients were about 5 times higher than the corresponding \ncells from control donors. Finally, the  median fluorescence inten -\nsity (MFI) of IL-6 (101,92\u00b144,13), IL-4 (130,65\u00b150,18) and TNF-a \n(130,65\u00b130,14) in plasma from T2DM patients (n=4) tend to be high -\ner that the control counterparts (n=5) (IL-6 69,26\u00b19,26 (p= 0.1435); \nIL-4 93,91\u00b17,43 (p= 0.3819); and TNF-a 46,49\u00b10,69 (p= 0.0824)). In \nconclusion, the results suggest that urine from T2DM patients pres -\nent increased detached podocytes, which express higher levels of \npurinergic pathway ectoenzymes.\nNEUROCIENCIAS\n191. (74) EVIDENCE FOR RESVERATROL MODULATING \nRAC1 ACTIVATION IN MICROGLIAL CELLS\nAna Julia Ticchi, Eva Wertheimer, Fernando Correa\nCEFyBO.\nMaternal immune activation (MIA) produces structural, metabolic \nand epigenetic changes in the fetus resulting in long-term neurolog -\nical and neuropsychiatric consequences.  Microglial cells are one of \nthe main effectors of the innate immune response in the CNS. Ex -\ncessive microglial activation leads to CNS damage due to excessive \nproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators.  It has been determined \nthat Rac1 plays a central role in the inflammatory response and mi -\ncroglial neurotoxicity in the CNS.\nIt has been demonstrated that resveratrol has anti-inflammatory, \nantioxidant properties that translate into neuroprotective effects in \nadults.\nObjectives: To study the possible neuroprotective effects of resver -\natrol in the fetal CNS in a model of MIA induced by bacterial lipo -\npolysaccharide (LPS) and to characterize Rac1 signaling pathways \ninvolved in the modulation of the microglial response.\nResveratrol was administered to Balb/c females on gestational day \n15, which were then exposed or not to LPS. After LPS administra -\ntion, maternal sera and amniotic liquid were collected to evaluate \nthe expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. Additionally, \ncell cultures of the murine microglial cell line BV2 were exposed \nto different concentrations of LPS and resveratrol and variations in \nRac1 activation were analyzed at different time-points.\nResults: Preliminary results show that the LPS-triggered MIA induc -\nes IL-6 in the mother sera and in the amniotic liquid (p <0.05 respec -\ntively) while resveratrol prevents this effect.\nThe optimal concentration and time exposure of BV2 cells to LPS \nthat induces maximal Rac1 activation are 100 ng and 15 min (p < \n0,05). We observed that in vitro treatment with resveratrol interferes \nwith the activation of Rac1 signaling pathways.\nConclusion: Maternal immune activation increases IL-6 production \nin peripheral blood and amniotic fluid. Rac1 activation decreases in \nthe presence of resveratrol.\n192.

Garay (Laboratory of Neuroendocrine Biochemistry, Institu -\nto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental; Faculty of Medicine, \nUniversidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina)\nTibolone (TIB) is a synthetic estrogenic compound with tissue-spe -\ncific actions commonly used to prevent symptoms in postmeno -\npausal women. The tissue selectivity of TIB depends on its specific \nlocal transformation to active metabolites that can exert estrogenic, \nprogestinic and androgenic activities.  Recently, antioxidant and an -\nti-inflammatory actions of TIB have been described in the CNS. In \nthis study we assessed the effect of TIB on the clinical outcome, \ninflammation and myelination in the spinal cord of experimental au -\ntoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice model of multiple Sclerosis \n(MS). To this purpose, female C57BL/6 mice were divided into con -\ntrol (CTRL), EAE receiving TIB (0.08mg/kg s.c every other day from \nthe day of induction (EAE-TIB) or EAE receiving vehicle (EAE-V) \ngroups. Spinal cord tissues were collected at day 17 post induction \nand subjected to qPCR and Western Blot analysis. EAE-TIB group \nshowed decreased microglial reaction revealed by lower CD11B \nand toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) mRNAs expression respect of EAE-V \n(p<0.01 and p<0.05). NLRP3 inflammasome signalling pathway \nwas assessed by analyzing NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 mRNAs and \ncleaved caspase 1 protein expression. EAE-V showed an aberrant \nexpression of NLRP3 and activated caspase 1 vs CTRL mice, while \nTIB administration significantly decreased both parameters (EAE-V \nvs EAE-TIB; p<0.05 and p<0.01 respectively).  IL-1\u03b2 was hyper -\nexpressed in EAE-V vs CTL and significantly decreased with TIB \ntreatment (p<0.05 and p<0.001 respectively), while IL-18 showed \nno intergroup differences. In addition, the EAE-TIB group showed \nreduced myelin basic protein mRNA loss (p<0.05), and better clin -\nical outcome compared to TIB untreated EAE mice. Interestingly, \nhypertrophic effects on the uterus was not evidenced by TIB admin -\nistration.  As a conclusion, TIB exerts anti-inflammatory and myelin \nprotective actions in the spinal cord of EAE mice without uterine \ncompromise, suggesting its potential value for MS treatment.\n193. (87) ALZHEIMER\u00b4S DISEASE AS A METABOLIC PATHOL -\nOGY: INFLAMMATION AND INSULIN RESISTANCE IN \nA MOUSE MODEL OF AD. IN VIVO AND IN VITRO AP -\nPROACHES.\nMelisa Bentivegna, Amal Gregosa, Angeles  Vinuesa, Carlos  Pom -\nilio, Jessica  Presa, Flavia  Saravia, Juan  Beauquis \n(IBYME)\nInsulin resistance and chronic inflammation are frequently associ -\nated with the development of cognitive disorders and neurodegen -\nerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). However, it is \nnot yet clear whether there is a causal link between these two fac -\ntors, and which one appears earlier in the pathology. Our objective \nwas to study metabolic parameters and inflammation in a possible \nbrain insulin resistance context in a transgenic model of AD, the \nPDAPP-J20 mouse at the age of 8 months. We hypothesized that \nan inflammatory environment could trigger insulin resistance in the \nbrain, neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. We found low -\ner glycemic levels and altered phosphorylation levels of AKT mea -\nsured by Western Blot -an indicator of the insulin signaling status- in \nthe hippocampus of transgenic mice compared with control mice \n(p<0.05). However, we did not find significant differences in pAKT/\nAKT in the liver and hypothalamus. In addition, insulinemia was not \naffected. We also evaluated inflammation markers as GFAP and \nS100b immunoreactive areas by immunohistochemistry in the hip -\npocampus, which were both increased in transgenic mice (p<0.05). \nMicroglial soma size was also increased, suggesting a glial proin -\nflammatory state. Finally, to understand the role of A\u03b2 on astrocytes, \nwe evaluated the effect of fibrillar A\u03b2 on C6 cells in vitro, through the \nNFkB and the AKT pathways. Astrocytes exposed to fA\u03b2 showed \nincreased nuclear translocation of NFkB and decreased AKT phos -phorylation (p<0.05), suggesting  astrocyte inflammatory activation \nand impaired insulin signaling, respectively. Our results show that \ninflammation and insulin signaling impairment in the hippocampus \nare found in an early stage of the pathology when there is yet little \nA\u03b2 deposition,  suggesting an early role of these pathways on the \npathophysiology of experimental AD.\n194. (93) THE ADMINISTRATION OF TELLURIUM TO RAT \nMOTHERS IN THE LACTATION PERIOD AFFECTS THE \nNATURAL LATERALIZED EXPLORATION AND SOCIAL \nACTIVITY OF THEIR OFFSPRING MATURING RATS.\nEdgardo O. Alvarez Toro (Lab Epig Neuropsicofarm Exptl, \nFCVet, UCCSL,San Luis) , Silvia G. Ratti (Lab Epig Neurop -\nsicofarm Exptl, FCM, UCCSL, San Luis, FCM UNCuyo, Men -\ndoza) , Osvaldo  Sacchi (IMBECU-CONICET, Mendoza)\nPrevious evidence from our laboratory showed that intact rats sub -\njected to a chronic administration (51 days) of non-toxic K2TeO3 \n(Te, 0.39\u03bcg/L) the normal response of lateralized exploration and \nsocial activity of the offspring maturing rats was affected. In order to \ninvestigate if these modified behaviours were due to Te prolonged \nexposition, in the present work a short treatment (21 days) of Te ad -\nministration to mother rats in the lactation period was applied. At 30 \nday-old, all offspring were tested in the Double Lateral Hole Board \nLabyrinth (DLHB), and 24 hours later in the Intruder to Resident Test \n(IRT), as previously described. The following groups were formed: \nControl rats (n=20) and Te-treated rats (n=18). Results found in the \nDLHB showed that Control rats had a left biased exploration (70\u00b15.3 \nVs. 45.5\u00b14.1 Counts/3 min; left Vs right, p < 0.01), while Te-treated \nrats showed no side preference exploration (49\u00b13.9 Vs 47.5\u00b16.3 \nC/3min; Left Vs right, n.s.). In the IRT, control rats showed a latency \nto confront the intruder rat of 9\u00b12.6 C/2min; while in the Te-treated \nrats latency was 32\u00b18.3 C/2min, statistically different from Control \ngroup (p < 0.02). Duration of social interaction in the Control group \nwas 93\u00b15.5 C/3min; while in the Te-treated rats was 73\u00b13.6 C/3min, \nstatistically lower from Control group (p < 0.01). In conclusion, re -\nsults suggest that it is not necessary a prolonged administration of \nTe in order to affect the exploratory and social activity in the offspring \nrats.\n195.

The Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies.\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia. Among \nother histopathological hallmarks, it is characterized by the abnor -\nmal accumulation of Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides. Vascular alterations \nand blood-brain barrier disruption are also evidenced in AD patients, \nin close association with perivascular amyloid deposits, which are \ncomposed mainly of A\u03b2 1-40. In this study we characterized the pro -\ngression of vascular alterations in the hippocampus of PDAPP-J20 \nmice, a validated transgenic model for AD.  We found a significant \nincrement in morphological alterations in vessels from AD mice \ncompared to age-matched controls (p<0.05), mainly in vessels \nsurrounded by A\u03b2 deposits. At ages in which parenchymal amyloid \ndeposits were evident, we found an increased permeability of the \nblood-brain barrier, evidenced by the extravasation of systemically \ninjected Evans blue and sodium fluorescein (p<0.05), in association \nwith a decreased immunoreactivity for the endothelial tight junction \nprotein occludin (p<0.05). Then, we obtained cerebral vascular frac -\ntions from AD and control mice, and measured the levels of vascular \nproteins through mass spectrometry and proteomics analysis. We \nidentified 82 proteins whose levels were decreased in AD mice. The \nenrichment analysis showed that the most represented cellular pro -\ncesses in this sample were translation and protein synthesis. A\u03b2 MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020104\nwas linked to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) induction in the \nCNS. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to A\u03b21-\n40 showed not only a decrease in the occludin detection (p<0.05) \nwith concomitant decreased trasendothelial electrical resistance \n(p<0.05) but an increment in BIP and IRE-1\u03b1 expression (p<0.05), \nconfirming that A\u03b2 caused ERS with disruption of the blood-brain \nbarrier in this in vitro model. Our results suggest that ERS, down -\nregulation of translation and loss of proteostasis in vascular cells \nemerge as mediators for A\u03b2-induced endothelial alterations during \nthe progression of AD.\n196.

Among the underlying mechanisms, \nchronic inflammation and insulin resistance are crucial factors, also \nassociated with alterations of sphingolipid metabolism. Taking this \ninto account, we intend to study mechanisms associated with the \nimpact of metabolic disturbances on the brain. We aim to assess \nthe inflammatory response induced by a lipotoxic context and the \ncommunication between glial cells mediated by the release of extra -\ncellular vesicles (EVs) as vehicles of damage propagation.\nWe previously found that C57BL/6 mice exposed to a high fat diet \n(HFD) presented neuroinflammation, decreased neurogenesis and \nstructural synaptic alterations, together with spatial memory im -\npairment. To assess potential mechanisms involved, we used an \nin vitro  approach emulating the lipotoxic context with the saturated \nfatty acid palmitate (PA). Microglial cultures exposed to PA showed \na pro-inflammatory profile and, after purification of EVs from the \nconditioned media (CM), we found that exosomes altered dendritic \nspine morphology of hippocampal neurons. Here, we show that in \nthe presence of ceramide synthesis inhibitor Cambinol, the induced \nexpression of IL1\u03b2 in PA-exposed BV2 microglial cells was dimin -\nished (p<0.05). In the same line, Cambinol seemed to prevent the \ndecreased phagocytic capacity of BV2 cells exposed to PA. Final -\nly, regarding the interaction between glial cells, preliminary results \nshowed that CM from PA-stimulated BV2 cells was able to induce \nthe expression of IL1\u03b2 in C6 astrocytic cell line. Interestingly, af -\nter EVs isolation, exosomes derived from PA-microglia exerted the \nsame effect. \nOur results suggest a role of ceramide pathway in the inflammatory \ncontext induced by PA and the potential involvement of exosome-like \nEVs in the propagation of the damage response between glial cells.\n197. (120) SUSTAINED INCREASE IN DNMT1 AND DNMT3A \nEXPRESSION IN RESPONSE TO THE INITIAL PRECIPI -\nTATING INJURY IN LITHIUM-PILOCARPINE EPILEPTIC \nMODEL.\nGomez DD1, Rossi A1, Murta V1, Ramos AJ1\n1. IBCN UBA-CONICET, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad \nde Buenos Aires\nRetrospective studies have shown that temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) \npatients refer an initial precipitating event (IPE) during early child -\nhood and a subsequent latency period in which seizures are ab -\nsent. Latency period is a poorly studied subject in epilepsy, but it is \nproposed that essential steps in epileptogenesis occur during this \nperiod. The lithium-pilocapine model presents most of the charac -\nteristics of human TLE in experimental animals, including an IPE fol -\nlowed by a latency period. Epigenetics changes in the latency period \nhave been described. On the other hand, important astroglial genes, \nsuch as Kir4.1 which is involved in K+ homeostasis, are heavily epi -\ngenetically-regulated genes. In the present work we induced an IPE \n(status epilepticus, SE) in male Wistar rats by administering 3 mEq/\nkg LiCl and 30 mg/kg pilocarpine. SE lasted for 20 min and then seizures were stopped with 20 mg/kg diazepam. Animals were sacri -\nficed at 7- or 21- days post-SE (DPSE) and brains processed for bio -\nchemistry or fixed for immunofluorescence. We observed that Kir4.1 \nexpression was reduced in hippocampal and cortical astrocytes \nconcomitantly with increased GFAP expression and reactive gliosis \nin these areas. Kir4.1 gene (KCNJ10) decreased mRNA was also \nshown by RT-PCR and we consistently noticed an increase in the \nexpression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a at 7- and 21-DPSE. By perform -\ning in silico analysis, we have also observed that proximal DNMT1 \nand DNMT3a promoters have consensus sites for NF-kB and Stat3 \ntranscription factors that are known to be activated in reactive astro -\ncytes. Considering published evidence regarding the participation of \nDNMT1 in the regulation of KCNJ10 in astrocytes, we here propose \nthat the observed astroglial Kir4.1 downregulation induced by the \nSE-induced IPE is probably lying downstream of reactive astroglio -\nsis, NF-kB/Stat3 activation and increased DNMT activity. \nSupported by grants: PICT 2017-2203; UBACYT; PIP CONICET 479\n198. (134) SPLEEN-BRAIN INFLAMMATORY COUPLING IN A \nMODEL OF TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY\nSarchi PV1, Rossi AR1, Ramos AJ1\n1IBCN UBA-CONICET, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de \nBuenos Aires\nA high percentage of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), \none of the most frequent neurological diseases, refer an initial pre -\ncipitating event, such as complex febrile seizures during childhood, \nfollowed by a silent latency period (LP), until the onset of the chronic \nseizures phase. Using the lithium-pilocarpine rat model of TLE we \nhave previously shown that neurodegeneration, reactive gliosis and \nmacrophages brain infiltration occur during the LP and that early \ninterventions limiting immune activation during the LP increase epi -\nleptic threshold during the chronic phase (Rossi et al., 2013; 2017). \nWe here studied the peripheral immune cells participation in the LP \nthat follows pilocarpine-induced SE. Male Wistar rats were treated \nwith lithium-pilocarpine (127 mg/kg /30 mg/kg) developing SE, that \nwere limited to 20 min by 20 mg/kg i.p. diazepam. Histological anal -\nysis of spleen sections 8 h or 1, 2, 3 days post SE (DPSE) showed a \npeak in the disorganization of the spleen white pulp at 1 DPSE. This \ndisorganization seemed to be spleen-specific since we did not find \nsignificant changes in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). \nOn the other hand, we found increased abundance of CD4+ lym -\nphocytes in the choroid plexus at 3DPSE, suggesting a brain-spleen \ninflammatory coupling. Accordingly, our loss of function studies per -\nformed on splenectomized and sham-operated rats (1w before lith -\nium-pilocarpine-induced SE) showed that splenectomy decreased \nastrogliosis and neuroinflammation at 7DPSE. Our results suggest \nthat peripheral immune system is probably responding to specific \nbrain-derived clues triggered by the SE and the spleen is directly in -\nvolved in the modulation of neuroinflammation that follows SE.

In \nnon-parametric bivariate analyzes, the Chi-square test was used, \nin parametric ANAVA. Linear and logistic regression models were \nperformed for the others analyzes. A level of significance was estab -\nlished for all cases of p <0.05.\nSeventy-six patients were studied with a mean age of 68.39 \u00b1 11.86 \nyears, predominantly female, the years of schooling were 08.13 \u00b1 \n04.40. The MoCA test score had a mean below the cut-off point of \n22.36 \u00b1 06.30. For BMI, the score was 26.47 \u00b1 05.34. Linear re -\ngression analysis demonstrated a positive association between BMI \nand MoCA score (CI: LI-16.49, LS-24.41) para (p <0.0001). An in -\ncrease in BMI was associated with WMH (p=0.0113) and bleeding \n(p = 0.0073) in a logistic regression model. Functional level did not \nshow statistically significant association with BMI.\nThe increase in BMI has a negative impact on cognition, and the \nalterations found in brain MRI. These results support the evidence \nfor the relationship between nutrition and cognition.\n200.

In this work, we \naimed to elucidate the energy state, redox balance and mitochon -\ndrial remodeling status in cerebral cortex in an experimental mod -\nel of endotoxemia. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected \nto a single dose of LPS (ip 8 mg kg-1 body weight) for 6 h. State \n3 O2 consumption and inner mitochondrial membrane potential \nwere found increased, whereas ATP production was observed de -\ncreased, possibly indicating a low efficient oxidative phosphoryla -\ntion process as this scenario was accompanied with a decreased \nP/O ratio. O2- production and both systemic and tissue NO markers \nwere observed increased in treated animals. The existence of nitrat -\ned proteins suggests an alteration in the local redox balance and \npossible harmful effects over the energetic processes. Mitochondrial \narchitecture analysis showed an increase in de novo mitochondrial \nsynthesis (increased expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and TFAM) and fusion \nprocess (increased expression of OPA-1). The observed elongation \nof mitochondria correlates with the occurrence of mild mitochondrial \ndysfunction and increased levels of systemic NO. Our work presents \nnovel results that contribute to unravel the mechanism by which the \ntriad endotoxemia-redox homeostasis-energy management interact \nin the brain cortex, leading to propose an interesting target to base \nfuture developing therapeutics for preserving this organ from inflam -matory and oxidative damage.\n201. (175) REGULATION OF GABAA RECEPTOR EXPRESSION \nINDUCED BY PROLONGED BENZODIAZEPINE STIM -\nULATION DEPENDS ON THE ACTIVATION OF L-TYPE \nVOLTAGE-GATED CALCIUM CHANNELS\nMedina NB1, Pietko MV1, Gravielle MC1\n1. Instituto de Investigaciones Farmacol\u00f3gicas (ININFA), \nFacultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad de Buenos \nAires-CONICET\nPersistent stimulation of GABAA receptors by positive allosteric mod -\nulators, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neurosteroids and \nethanol, induces adaptive changes that result in tolerance. In par -\nticular, the clinical use of benzodiazepines has been limited by the \ndevelopment of tolerance to most of their pharmacological actions. \nAlthough different alterations in the structure and function of the \nGABAA receptors have been described, the signaling pathways acti -\nvated by sustained exposure to benzodiazepines remain unknown. \nThe aim of this work was to elucidate the signaling cascade triggered \nby prolonged benzodiazepine treatments that lead to downregula -\ntion of GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit. To this end, primary neu -\nronal cultures from rat cerebral cortex were treated with diazepam \n(25 \u03bcM), a classical benzodiazepine, for 48 h. At the end of this in -\ncubation, cells were collected for biochemical and molecular biolog -\nical experiments. Flunitrazepam binding experiments showed that \ndiazepam induced uncoupling between GABA and benzodiazepine \nsites (40 %, p<0.05), which was blocked by flumazenil, picrotoxin, \nor nifedipine. Quantitative real-time PCR and nuclear run-on assays \ndemonstrated that diazepam produced a transcriptional repression \nof GABAA receptor \u03b11 subunit gene (45 % decrease, p<0.05) that \nwas inhibited in the presence of nifedipine and a protein kinase A \n(PKA) inhibitor. These findings suggest that benzodiazepine treat -\nment stimulates the calcium influx through L-type voltage-gated cal -\ncium channels which in turn activates a PKA-dependent cascade \nfinally leading to changes in GABAA receptor expression. These \nchanges may be responsible for the uncoupling between GABA \nand benzodiazepine site interactions. Elucidation of the signaling \npathway activated by benzodiazepines provides a new spectrum of \npossible molecular interventions to extend the initial clinical benefits \nof benzodiazepines and thus, prevent the development of tolerance.\n202. (203) INCREASED SEIZURES SUSCEPTIBILITY AND RE -\nACTIVE GLIOSIS IN MALES SUBJECTED TO EXPERI -\nMENTAL FEBRILE SEIZURES\nRossi AR1, Rodr\u00edguez F1, Sarchi P1, Ramos AJ1\n1. IBCN UBA-CONICET, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad \nde Buenos Aires.\nFebrile seizures occur in 3\u20135% of children between 6 months and \n5 years of age. Retrospective studies in adult epilepsy patients \nshow an initial precipitating injury, usually febrile seizures, during \nchildhood. Using an animal model of hyperthermic seizures (HS), \nwe have previously shown that male HS-exposed animals exhibit \na significative reduction in the convulsive threshold and moderate \nreactive gliosis with an atypical astrocytes distribution in the pyriform \ncortex and other brain structures while female did not develop SE \nand exhibited lower reactive gliosis compared to males. Here we \nextended the analysis of gender differences by studying the distri -\nbution of S100B+ glial cells and microglial response in HS-exposed \nanimals. Rat pups (10-11 postnatal days old, PND) were placed in \na glass chamber, and their core temperature was raised by a regu -\nlated stream of moderately heated air (39-42\u00b0C). Body temperature \nwas measure at baseline, seizure onset and every 2 min during the \nseizures. Hyperthermic temperatures (39.5\u201342.5 \u00b0C) were main -\ntained for 30 min. The seizures onset was monitored behaviourally, \nand consisted of an acute sudden arrest of hyperthermia-induced \ntonic freeze postures and occasional oral automatism (biting and \nchewing) and often body flexion. Rats were then placed on a cool \nsurface, monitored for 5 min before being returned to their moth -\ners. At PND35 rats were deeply anesthetized, fixed and brains pro -\ncessed for immunohistochemistry and morphometrical studies. We \nobserved an increase in the area occupied by S100B + cells in fe -MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020106\nmales, although there was an increase in the number of S100B cells \nin both sexes. On the other hand, reactive microgliosis was more \nprominent in males compared with females. Our results strongly \nsuggest that males are more susceptible to HS exposure and this \ncould be related to their future susceptibility to develop epilepsy.\nSupported by grants: UBACYT, PICT 2017-2203, PIP CONICET 479\n203.

De \nRobertis, IBCN UBA-CONICET, Facultad de Medicina, Uni -\nversidad de Buenos Aires.\nAstrocytes are key players in the Central Nervous System injury. \nBy not completely defined pathways, reactive astrocytes may suf -\nfer a pathological remodeling engaging a pro-inflammatory pheno -\ntype that is very stable and promote further neuroinflammation and \nneurodegeneration. We here aimed to define the spatio-temporal \ndistribution of astroglial phenotypes after traumatic brain injury and \nthe consequences for neuronal survival and behavioral parameters. \nFollowing a stereotaxic stab wound injury (0.8 mm needle, coordi -\nnates 2 mm posterior and lateral to Bregma; 1 mm depth) performed \nin C57BL/6 mice and immunohistochemistry on brain sections, we \nclassified GFAP reactive astrocytes in five different phenotypes de -\nfined using Sholl analysis (Auzmendi et al., Molec. Neurobiol. 2019). \nWhile at 1 day post-injury (DPI) GFAP+ astrocytes were not different \nfrom contralateral non-injured hemisphere, at 3DPI and 7DPI high -\nly reactive phenotypes colocalized with altered neurons in lesion \npenumbra. At 14DPI highly reactive astrocytes and altered neurons \nwere abundant only in the lesion core. Pro-inflammatory gain of \nfunction paradigm was achieved by administering LPS (5 mg/Kg i.p) \nin lesioned animals, and that resulted in a greater number of com -\nplex reactive astrocytes at 7DPI (p<0.05) and a population of C3+ \nastrocytes. On the other hand, loss of function paradigm with chem -\nical NFkB blocker sulfasalazine (150 mg/kg i.p) significantly reduced \nhighly reactive astrocytes (p<0.05) and showed reduced neuronal \ndeath. Animal motor deficits were analyzed by computer-assisted \nopen field, but at 7DPI we were unable to detect significative dif -\nferences among groups probably due to the small lesion size. We \nconclude that increased GFAP+ higher complexity astrocytes are \nassociated with increased neuronal death and that NFkB pathway is \nlikely to be involved in the pathological conversion to the pro-inflam -\nmatory-neurodegenerative phenotype.\nGrants: UBACYT, PICT 2015-1451 and 2017-2203, PIP 479.\n204.

Instituto de Biolog\u00eda Celular y Neurociencias, Prof. Eduar -\ndo De Robertis (UBA-CONICET). Facultad de Medicina, Uni -\nversidad de Buenos Aires\nConversion of astrocytes to a pro-inflammatory phenotype leads to \nexacerbated neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity, therefore under -\nstanding this mechanism has become a main interest as a novel \npharmacological target. We here aim to understand an epigenetic \nmechanism which may lead to a sustained astrocyte response ex -\npanding inflammation and neuronal death. \nWe exposed primary cultures of cortical astrocytes containing dif -\nferent amounts of microglia (below 1% and up to 20%) to 25 ng/\nml Lipopolissacharide (LPS) for different periods of time to promote \npro-inflammatory conversion. Astroglial and microglial morphology \nwas analyzed using immunofluorescence. Nuclear localization of \np65 subunit was assessed as parameter of NFkB activation using \nimmunofluorescence for p65/GFAP/DAPI or p65/IBA/DAPI. As an \nindicator of chromatin remodeling, we studied the levels of acetylat -\ned histone 3 at lysins 9 and 14 (H3K9K14ac) using immunofluores -\ncence for H3K9K14ac/GFAP/DAPI. This epigenetic mark is known \nto be promoted by NFkB activation. Pro-inflammatory conversion of astrocytes was confirmed by analyzing expression of pro-inflamma -\ntory cytokines. \nResults show that LPS-induced astroglial conversion towards a \npro-inflammatory phenotype evidenced by changes in morphology, \nactivation of NFkB and cytokine expression is microglia-dependent. \nThis astroglial pro-inflammatory phenotype correlates with global \nchanges in nuclear H3K9K14ac only when they are co-cultured with \nmicroglia. \nOur work evidences a mechanism of gene regulation by chroma -\ntin remodeling which may underlie long term cellular changes in \nastrocyte phenotype conversion. Our results suggest a global re -\nconfiguration of the chromatin which could be pharmacologically \ntargeted to reduce neuroinflammation.

The administration of LPS significantly in -\ncreased (p\u22640.01, ANOVA) the NO content in the blood of the control \nanimals (1.9 \u00b1 0.1 AU), in the presence of either Fe-dextran, or LPS \nor LPS+Fe-dextran (1.5-, 10.5- and 14.2-folds, respectively). After 6 \nh of treatment, the administration of Fe-dextran or Fe-dextran+LPS, \nshowed a significant increase of the Fe content in total brain, de -\ntermined by acid mineralization, in the absence (20-fold), and in \npresence of LPS (17-fold). The labile Fe pool (LIP) content, deter -\nmined using calcein, was increased 6 h after Fe administration, and \nreturned to control values after 8 h. The content of A\u2022, determined \nby EPR, significantly increased after 6 h, in animals overloaded with \nFe-dextran in the absence of LPS (41%, p <0.05), without changes \nin the brains of animals treated with LPS or with LPS+Fe-dextran, \nas compared to the control values. These results suggested a pro -\ntective effect against the production of A\u2022 of the simultaneous acute \nadministration of Fe-dextran and LPS. This effect could be due to \n(i) the ability of NO generated by the LPS to chelate Fe with the \nformation of complexes which would favor the gradually incorpora -\ntion of the metal, and decreasing its catalytic capacity, or (ii) since \nFe-dextran administration leads to an increase in the nuclear levels \nof Nrf2/keap1, the activation of the antioxidant response mediated \nby changes in the glutathione metabolism related enzymes would \noccur, which could be a critical factor in the observed response. Fur -\nther studies are necessary to identify the mechanisms underlying \nthis treatment.\n206.

ABSTRACTS107\nWe have previously demonstrated that liver toxicity by APAP not re -\nsulting in acute organ failure produces hypolocomotion associated \nwith decrease in dopamine levels and reactive astrogliosis in selec -\ntive brain areas. The aim of the present work was to evaluate if these \neffects are still present a week after APAP intoxication. For this pur -\npose,  male Wistar rats were divided in 4 groups, dosed with APAP \n(1g/kg; i.p.) or vehicle. After one or seven days of treatment, rats \nwere anesthetized and intracardiacally perfused with PAF. Immu -\nnohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap) and tyrosine \nhydroxylase (TH) expression was performed on free-floating coronal \nsections. The percentage of reactive area in pre-frontal cortex (Pfc), \nNucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal striatum (DStr) and non-motor \ncortex (Cx) was quantified using imageJ (NIH). Since control one \nand seven day treated rats did not show any differences, samples \nwere pooled as a single control group. One day after APAP intoxi -\ncation, TH expression was decreased in DStr and NACs by 21% [t \n(2,11)=18.34, p=0.0003] and 20%; [t (2,11)=6.179, p=0.00159], re -\nspectively and restored to normal values by 7 days after treatment. \nHowever, no significant changes in TH expression were detected \nin Pfc and Cx at either time point.  Moderate reactive astrogliosis \nwas also detected at day one in all dopamine-rich areas of the brain \nexamined, with significant increments in GFAP immunoreactivity by \n26% for Pfc [t (2,10)=9.702, p=0.0045]; 88% for DStr [t (2,10)=9.702, \np=0.0045] and 25% [t (2,12)=8.156, p=0.0058] for NAc, returning to \nbasal value by day 7. However, no induction of GFAP was detected \nin Cx and no alterations in astrocyte numbers were observed in any \nof the areas analyzed at either time point. In conclusion, our results \ndemonstrate that the astrogliosis and altered dopaminergic level are \ntransitory alterations during APAP intoxication in rats and therefore, \nfull recovery in locomotive function is expected.\n207.

Seven days after surgery \nrats were euthanized and the primary visual cortex was dissected \n(CICUAL FFyB n\u00b0 3314). Antioxidant enzymes activities, GSH me -\ntabolism, NOX activity, iNOS expression, Nrf2 and NF-\u03baB activation \nwere evaluated.\nWhen compared to CG, GG showed 147% increase in NOX activity \n(p<0.05 ), increasing the steady state concentration of OS. NOX4 \nexpression was 90% higher in GG ( p<0.05 ). iNOS expression was \nincreased in GG (47%, p<0.05 ), induced by NF-\u03baB activation (48%, \np<0.01 ). As an adaptive response to OS, there was a 40% and 55% \nincrease in SOD ( p<0.01 ) and GPx ( p<0.05 ), respectively. However, \nthere was an alteration in glutathione metabolism in GG shown as a \n40% and 53% decrease in GR expression ( p<0.05 ) and GCL activ -\nity (p<0.05 ), respectively, which leads to a decrease in GSH/GSSG \nratio (55%, p<0.001 ). In addition, a decrease in Nfr2 expression was \nshown in GG (40%, p<0.05 ). This scenario leads to proteins (140%, \np<0.001 ) and lipids (70%, p<0.001 ) damage. \nThese results suggest that glaucoma induces damage to the prima -\nry visual cortex, such as oxidative modifications to macromolecules, \ndue to an enhancement in OS (H2O2 and NO) production from NOX \nfamily and iNOS. In this context the Nrf2 impairment could lead to a deficient antioxidant response. \n208.

Stx2 can also lead to \nencephalopathy with motor, cognitive and emotional impairments \nin 30% of cases. We have studied that Stx2 can bind to neurons \nthrough its receptor Gb3. Other authors have reported that Stx2 may \nbind to TLR4 in leukocytes, which leads to its activation and cytokine \nrelease. Given that microglial cells (MC) are CNS resident macro -\nphages, we hypothesize that MC would respond to Stx2 through a \nTLR4 receptor. Therefore, our aim was to determine by in vivo  and \nin vitro  studies whether Stx2 produces MC activation through TLR4 \nand cytokine release. Mice were subjected to the following sublethal \ntreatments: vehicle (control) or Stx2 (3ng)+LPS (800ng), to deter -\nmine MC reactivity by immunofluorescence and cytokine release \nby flow cytometry. In vitro  assays of MC were obtained from TLR4 \nKO rat brains which were treated with either control, LPS (50ng/\nml), Stx2 (50 or 200ng/ml) or Stx2+LPS. One way ANOVA analysis, \nand Bonferroni post-hoc analysis were performed for i n vivo  and in \nvitro studies. After 24h of treatment, Stx2+LPS treated mice showed \nan increase in the expression of IBA1 as well as in the number of \nMC (p<0.001). Further, after 6 hours of toxin treatments a significant \nincrease of IL6, TNF alfa and INF gamma was observed (p<0.001). \nIn vitro  studies showed that 200ng/ml of Stx2 and Stx2 (200 ng/\nml)+LPS produced an increase in the area occupied by MC respect \nother treatments (p<0.001). Further, the expression levels of IBA1 \nand the number of MC were increased in Stx2 (50 and 200ng/ml) \nand Stx2 (50 and 200ng/ml)+LPS with respect to LPS alone and \nthe control (p<0.05). We concluded that co-treatment of Stx2+LPS \nproduced early anti-inflammatory cytokines in the brain which could \nbe related with MC reactivity through a TLR4 independent pathway.  \n209.

In the present work, we evaluated the impact \nof senility on mitochondrial function in left ventricle heart, cerebral \ncortex and hippocampus after an acute exposure to HH.\nMale Wistar rats of 22 months of age were subjected to a simulated \n4,400 m altitude (58.7 kPa=440 mmHg) in a hypopressure chamber \nduring 48h. A group of the same number of sibling rats remained as \ncontrols at sea level atmospheric pressure (101.3 kPa=760 mmHg). \nOxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, hydro -\ngen peroxide (H2O2) production and nitric oxide (NO) levels were \nmeasured in cortical and hippocampal mitochondria. In addition, \ncytochrome oxidase activity and NO production were evaluated in \nmitochondrial fractions isolated from left ventricle heart. Differences \nwere considered significant when p<0.05.\nHypobaric hypoxia induced mitochondrial depolarization (18%) and \ndecreases in both state 4 (43%) and state 3 (37%) respiratory rates \nassociated with an increment in NO (48%) and H2O2 (23%) produc -\ntion in cerebral cortex. In the hippocampus, we observed a decrease \nin mitochondrial membrane potential (18%) and an increase in NO \nproduction (46%), without changes in oxygen consumption and \nH2O2 production after HH exposure. Regarding heart left ventricle \nmitochondria, HH was able to decrease NO production by 47% and \nto induce cytochrome oxidase activity by 29%, as compared with \ncontrols.\nResults indicate that the mitochondrial response to HH would be \ndependent on the changes in NO production and in the degree of \nmitochondrial membrane polarization. According to oxygen demand \nand sensitivity of each tissue, the modulation of both NO levels and \nmitochondrial membrane potential changes would integrate in a re -\nsponse mechanism and/or endogenous protection against hypoxia\n212.

Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n en Biomedicina de Buenos Aires \n\u2013 CONICET \u2013 Instituto Partner de la Sociedad Max Planck \n(IBioBA-CONICET-MPSP)\nTauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the \nformation of intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau deposits. Nota -\nbly, aberrant tau accumulation in brain often co-occurs with other \nprotein aggregates, suggesting that there might be common factors \nsupporting their deregulation. Accumulating evidence points to the \nPIAS SUMO E3-ligases as SUMOylation inductors of several key \nproteins involved in neurodegeneration, modifying their solubility, \nactivity, or stability. Taking this into account, we hypothesize that \nthese enzymes could be common regulatory factors implicated in \nneurodegenerative processes. The aim of this work is to determine \nthe role of PIAS family in the regulation of tau protein homeostasis. \nBy means of a western blot (WB)-based screening in HT22 cells \noverexpressing human 2N4R WT tau (hTau) together with PIAS \nfamily members, we observed that only PIAS4 increased total tau \nlevels (+1.75, p<0.001). This result was corroborated in N2a cells \nlines stably expressing endogenous levels of hTau (N2a_hTauWT). \nPIAS4 promoted not only total tau but also phospho(P)-tau accu -\nmulation (total tau: +0.63, p<0.0001; PS396 -tau/total tau: +0.48, \np<0.05; PS214-tau/total tau: +1.8, p<0.001; PS202-tau/total tau: \n+1.6, p<0.001, PS[396/404]-tau/total tau: +0.89, p<0.01). In addition, \nthe SUMOylation mutant cells, N2a_hTauK340R, exhibited a similar \nresponse upon PIAS4 expression. Accordingly, our niquel affinity \npurification experiments showed that PIAS4 was unable to induce ABSTRACTS109\nSUMO conjugation to tau, indicating that it is not a tau SUMO-E3 \nligase. Finally, our preliminary autophagic flux assays revealed that \nPIAS4 might be blocking selective autophagy degradation of tau.\nSupported by ANPCyT, CONICET, UBA and FOCEM (COF 03/11) \ngrants.\n213.

Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nFluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been \napproved to treat major depressive and obsessive-compulsive dis -\norders in pediatric patients along with some off-label uses. Several \nconcerns were raised when it was determined that Fluoxetine could \nlead children to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Although well char -\nacterized for adults, little is known about the effect of Fluoxetine on \npediatric patients. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect \nof early exposure to Fluoxetine on social interaction, stereotypical \nand exploratory activities, and anxiety. Male and female Wistar rats \nwere daily administrated (sc.) with Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or saline \nbetween postnatal days (PND) 16-35 and behaviorally evaluated \nat PND 30-35. Concerning social behavior, Fluoxetine treatment in \nmales dramatically reduced social play behavior measured as the \nnumber of pinnings and social preference evaluated in a three-cham -\nber task. On the contrary, Fluoxetine did not modify these behav -\niors in females. Also, only in male, Fluoxetine treatment increased \nstereotypical behaviors measured as the number of self-grooming \nevents and enhanced anxiety-like behavior indicated by a reduc -\ntion in the time spent in the open arms of an elevated plus-maze. \nNotably, while in males Fluoxetine treatment did not affect explor -\natory activity, in females it decreased the number of hole-pokings. \nRegardless of sex, Fluoxetine treatment did not modify locomotor \nactivity and increased serotonin immunoreactivity in the hippocam -\npus These results strongly indicate that pre-puberal rat exposure to \nFluoxetine targets social interaction, exploration, stereotypical and \nanxiety-like behaviors in a sex-dependent manner. Our results also \nhighlight male vulnerability to modulation of serotonin levels during \ninfancy and pre-puberty. \n214.

Although \nASD incidence is four times higher in boys than in girls, sex differ -\nences have not been clarified. The rat model of autism induced by \nprenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) has been characterized \nin males (MVPA), while female rat VPA (FVPA) phenotype is still \ncontroversial. The aim of this work was to further characterize the \nbehavioral profile of FVPA and explore structural synapse markers, \ncell adhesion molecules and microglia morphology in the medial \nprefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus. At early postnatal \ndays (PND)7-15, and similar to MVPA, FVPA showed growth and \nmaturation deficits: delayed eye opening, lower body weight, altered \nnegative geotaxis, higher latencies to nest seeking response and a \ndeficit in swimming performance. At PND30-35, like MVPA, FVPA \nshowed a reduced number of interactions in the social play behav -\nior test, but they exhibited distinctive pinning features. Contrary to MVPA that showed an exploratory deficit and increased stereotyp -\nical activities, FVPA matched control female rat behavior. Notably, \nat PND35, mPFC of FVPA and MVPA showed an increase in syn -\naptophysin (SYN) and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and \na similar ramified/unramified microglia (Iba+) ratio. However, the \npolysialylated form of NCAM (PSA-NCAM) was increased in FVPA \nbut decreased in MVPA. In the hippocampus, both FVPA and MVPA \nshowed reduced SYN labeling and increased NCAM but only FVPA \ndisplayed a higher proportion of unramified microglia. Also, PSA-\nNCAM levels were preserved in FVPA but reduced in MVPA. To sum \nup, FVPA exhibit a mild behavioral phenotype accompanied with a \ndistinctive microglia profile and NCAM/PSA-NCAM ratio that may \nfacilitate structural synapse remodeling and plasticity.\n \n215.

In humans, acetyl-CoA is the end product of fat -\nty acid catabolism. Three types of ketone bodies can be synthesized \nfrom acetyl-CoA: acetone, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. Ke -\ntogenesis is increased under conditions of low glucose (eg, fasting), \nlow insulin or excessive alcohol consumption. This increase also \noccurs during certain diets, with low carbohydrate and high fat con -\nsumption, indicated to reduce the probability of seizures in epileptic \npatients or to alleviate the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Additional \nbeneficial effects of ketogenic diets have been described in models \nof Alzheimer\u2019s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The ac -\ntions of ketone bodies on neurotransmission have been poorly ex -\nplored and the mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic benefits \nof ketogenic diets remain under study.\nRecently Pflanz et al.

In this context, we studied \nthe modulatory effects of ketone bodies on GABAergic neurotrans -\nmission, evaluating the sensitivity of different subtypes of GABAA \nphasic and tonic receptors.

Testosterone is a complex \nsteroid that exerts its effects directly via androgen (AR) and indi -\nrectly via estrogen receptors (ER) after aromatization into estradi -\nol. Its reduced-metabolite 5a-dihydrotestosterone acts via AR. This \nstudy analyzed the metabolism of testosterone in the spinal cord \nand studied testosterone effects on myelin basic protein (MBP) and \nrotarod performance in male symptomatic WRs. Controls or WRs \nreceived empty or testosterone-filled silastic tubes for 2 months. The \nCSC from testosterone-treated WRs showed: 1) similar androgen \nlevels to untreated control, and 2) increased levels of testosterone \n(p<0.05), and its 5a-reduced metabolites, 5a-dihydrotestosterone \n(p<0.01) and 3b-androstanediol (p<0.001), but 3) undetectable lev -\nels of estradiol compared to untreated WRs. Testosterone-treated \ncontrols showed comparable steroid concentrations to untreated \ncontrols. CSC from WRs showed low number of oligodendrocyte \nCC1+cells (p<0.05) and high immunoreactivity for MBP (p<0.05) vs. \ncontrols.  In testosterone-treated WRs, we showed increased num -\nber of CC1+cells (p<0.01) associated to high % of immunoreactive \narea for MBP (p<0.05) vs. WRs. Clinically, testosterone treatment \nin WRs improved rotarod performance (p<0.05). Collectively, our \nfindings indicate a promyelinating effect of testosterone in the CSC \nof Wobbler-ALS mice. These results coincided with a high concen -\ntration of androgen-reduced derivatives after testosterone treatment \nsuggesting that the profile of steroid metabolites may have a benefi -\ncial role on disease progression.\n217.

Fundaci\u00f3n para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurol\u00f3 -\ngicas de la infancia (FLENI-CONICET) \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative proteinopathy \nwhich is the main cause of dementia in adults. It is estimated that 5% \nof cases are caused by inherited mutations in genes such as Pre -\nsenilin-1 ( PSEN1 ). Previously, our group reported a novel heterozy -\ngous variant in PSEN1  (c.356C>T; p.T119I) in an Argentine family \nwith early- and late-onset AD. In order to functionally validate this \nvariant, we aimed to generate a human induced pluripotent stem cell \n(hiPSC) line from dermic fibroblasts (DF) of a male mutation carrier. \nTo this purpose, we first infected patient DF with a STEMCCA lenti -\nviral vector encoding the Yamanaka reprogramming factors ( OCT-4 , \nKLF4 , SOX2  y c-MYC ) and obtained two clones, termed FFAD1.2c4 \nand FFAD1.2c8. Both clones exhibited typical hiPSCs morphologi -\ncal characteristics (formation of compact multicellular colonies with \na high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and distinct colony borders) and high \nAlkaline Phosphatase (AP) activity. Moreover, we also observed ro -\nbust expression of different stemness-associated markers (OCT-4, \nNANOG, SSEA4, TRA1-80, and TRA1-60),) analyzed by immuno -\nfluorescence and RT-qPCR. Also, using a non-directed method of \ndifferentiation (embryoid bodies assay) we demonstrated that at \nleast FFAD1.2c4 had the pluripotent potential to be differentiated \ninto cells from the three germinal layers (mesoderm, endoderm and \nectoderm) as judged by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence anal -\nysis of Smooth muscle actin (SMA), Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and \nNestin differentiation markers expression, respectively. Finally, both \nclones exhibited the same normal karyotype (46, XY) and PSEN1  \nT119I genotype as the parental DF cells and silenced ectopic ex -\npression of Yamanaka gene. Overall, we successfully obtained an \nhiPSCs line (FFAD1.2) carrying the AD PSEN1  T119I genotype.\n218. (428) NEURONS DERIVED FROM HUMAN PLURIPOTENT \nSTEM CELLS AS A MODEL FOR STUDYING NEURAL \nSTRESS AND CDK5 SIGNALING\nMucci S1, Rodr\u00edguez Varela MS1, Isaja L1, Sevlever GE1, \nScassa ME1, Romorini L1.\n1. Laboratorio de Investigaciones Aplicadas a las Neurocien -\ncias (FLENI - CONICET)Neurodegeneration is a complex multifactorial process that caus -\nes progressive loss of structure or function of neurons. CDK5/p35 \ncomplex is involved in neuronal homeostasis. However, stressful \nstimuli induce calpain-mediated cleavage of p35 to p25. p25 in turns \nforms a more stable CDK5/p25 hyperactive complex that participate \nin neurodegenerative mechanisms. Although CDK5 signaling has \nbeen intensively study in animal models, there are currently no good \nin vitro  models for studying its participation in human neuronal ho -\nmeostasis and neurodegenerative processes. In this work we aimed \nto generate an in vitro  human model for studying CDK5 signaling \nand neural stress based on the neuronal differentiation of human \nembryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (hESCs and hiPSCs, \nrespectively). First, hESCs (H9 line) and hiPSCs (FN2.1 line) were \nderived to neural stem cells (NSC), which were then differentiated \ninto generic neurons using 2D protocol. Phenotypes were validat -\ned by immunofluorescence of lineage specific markers (Sox-1 and \nSox-2 for NSC, MAP2 and Tuj-1 for neurons). Next, neurons were \nsubjected to stressful stimuli (rotenone 1\u03bcM for 24h and calcium \nionophore A23187 2\u03bcM for 2h) and an increase in mitochondrial \nmembrane potential was observed (measured using Mitoprobe JC-1 \nAssay). Moreover, morphologic changes (axonal spheroids appear -\nance) were found in derived-neurons upon stressful stimuli. Final -\nly, we found that p35 is highly expressed (quantified by RT-qPCR \nand western blot) in derived-neurons and that rotenone and A23187 \ntreatments induced its cleavage to p25 (analyzed by western blot). \nFurther, p35 cleavage was mediated by calpains as proteolysis was \ninhibited with a calpain inhibitor (ALLN, 50\u03bcM). In conclusion, neu -\nrons-derived from hESCs and hiPSCs are potentially a good in vitro  \nhuman model for studying the relevance of CDK5 signaling in neural \nstress as they responded to stressful stimuli inducing calpain-medi -\nated cleavage of p35 to p25.\n219.

Despite the public impact of MD, its etiology remains un -\nknown. In recent years, evidence reveals a key role of the immune \nsystem in the development and maintenance of MD. We have \nrecently shown that plasma proinflammatory IL-12 and IL-6 were \nincreased in patients with depression and suicidal behavior. Inter -\nestingly, these cytokines positively correlate with altered monocytes \nactivation and proportions.\nWe aim to determine the differences in the profile and activation \nstatus of circulating monocytes in patients with MD vs healthy con -\ntrols (HC) at baseline and after a 6-month follow-up. Psychiatrists \nused the International Psychiatry Interview (MINI) to diagnose MD, \nand the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HADRS) to define ac -\ntive disease (AD) or non-active disease (NAD). Blood samples were \nobtained, and the classical, intermediate, and non-classical mono -\ncyte subsets were analyzed by FACS. After 6-month, patients were \nre-evaluated for depressive and inflammatory status. The study was \napproved by IRB, each participant gives written consent.\nMD sample was 23% male, 77% female with a 25-62 year age range. \nThe percentage of classical monocytes was reduced in MD (72.0 \u00b1 \n2.6, N=23) vs HC (87.0 \u00b1 1.7, N=5) together with an increase of the \nintermediate fraction, MD (11.8 \u00b1 1.6) vs HC (4.4 \u00b1 0.5). After segre -\ngation, the AD patients showed the most significant change in terms \nof percentage of classical (p<0.001) and intermediate monocytes ABSTRACTS111\n(p<0.05) compared with HC; meanwhile, no significant differences \nwere observed yet between AD (N=12) vs NAD (N=11) patients.                                                                                 \nInterestingly, after follow-up, five patients with improved HDRS \nscores showed significant changes in the percentage of classical \n(p<0.01) and intermediate (p<0.05) monocytes compared to the \nbaseline. These data suggest that the monocyte profile is altered in \npatients with MD, and these changes could be useful to monitor the \ncellular inflammatory status at baseline and follow-up.\n220.

Previously, we showed that \nocular temperature reduction after experimental compression of NO \n(intraorbital optic nerve crush, IONC) significantly diminishes vision \nloss, and effect probably mediated by cold inducible RNA-binding \nproteins (CIRP). ZR17-2 is a cold mimetic synthetic molecule, able \nto prevent CIRP degradation in culture cells.  Our aim was to evalu -\nate the effect of ZR17-2 on retinal lesions due to NO trauma. Adult \nmale rats (n=28) were equally distributed in groups: 1a) CTL (left \neye, LE): simulation of surgery with intravitreal injection of vehicle; \n1b) IONC (right eye, RE): IONC with intravitreal injection of vehicle; \n2a) CTLZR (LE): simulation of surgery with intravitreal injection of \nZR17-2; 2b) IONCZR (RE): IONC with intravitreal injection of ZR17-\n2. Each animal was its own control. Animals were euthanized five \ndays after surgery and eyes processed for TUNEL, or placed in a \ndark room fifteen days after surgery for 12 hs and inspected for sco -\ntopic electroretinography (ERG) and oscillatory potentials to evalu -\nate the integrity of the visual pathway. IONC and IONCZR depicted \nsignificant lower a- and b-waves amplitude than their respective \ncontrols; whereas, CTL and CTLZR did not show significant chang -\nes between them. In addition, IONC and IONCZR showed signifi -\ncant b-wave decrease related to CTL and CTLZR respectively. ION -\nCZR showed also a significant increase in the b-wave versus IONC. \nOscillatory potentials showed similar variations than ERG. On the \nother hand, retinas of CTL and CTLZR showed a few TUNEL+ cells, \nwhereas IONC showed a significant increase related to CTL and \nIONCZR. In conclusion, the present work corroborates the effec -\ntiveness of ZR17-2 in vivo  to prevent retinal lesions constituting an \ninnovative treatment for NO trauma, and enabling it use in future \npreclinical trials.\n221.

Besides, GABAergic neurotransmission \nwas shown to be sensitive to redox agents. We previously demon -\nstrated that tonic responses mediated by homomeric GABAA\u03c11 re-\nceptors can be modulated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ascorbic \nacid, glutathione and nitric oxide, through thiol modification of cys -teines. We also identified endogenous redox agents that modulate \nGABAA receptors involved in fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the \nretina and hippocampus, but the molecular mechanisms of action \nremain elusive. We analysed the effect of H2O2 on different hetero -\npentameric GABAA receptors by using heterologous expression of \nthese GABA-gated Cl- channels in Xenopus laevis  oocytes, followed \nby two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings of the GABA-evoked \nionic currents. H2O2 induced dose-dependent, reversible and volt -\nage-insensitive potentiating effects on GABAA\u03b11\u03b22 and GABAA\u03b15\u03b23 re-\nceptors. In contrast, GABAA\u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 and GABAA\u03b15\u03b23\u03b32 receptors activity \nwere not altered during exposure to H2O2, suggesting that the \u03b32 \nsubunit conferred a relative insensitivity to these endogenous redox \nagents. H2O2 effect on GABAA\u03b11\u03b22 was partially prevented by irre -\nversible alkylation of sulphydryl groups with NEM. Concentration-re -\nsponse curves in the presence of H2O2, compared to control values, \nshowed a leftward shift and an increase in the maximal response \n(EC50 GABA= 2.7(2.4 to 3.0) \u00b5M, nH=1.46\u00b10.12; EC50 GABA+H2O2=1.9(1.5 \nto 2.4)\u00b5M, nH=1.85\u00b10.38). As observed for many redox agents act -\ning on GABAA\u03c11 receptors, the degree of potentiation exerted by \nH2O2 on GABAA\u03b11\u03b22 responses decreased as GABA concentration \nincreased. Additional experiments are being performed to elucidate \nthe mechanisms of action underlying the effects of H2O2 on GABAA \nreceptors.\n222.

Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda y Biolog\u00eda Molecular y Celular, \nFCEyN, UBA.\nFK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is an Hsp90 co-chaperone that \nhas been described to regulate the activity of the glucocorticoid re -\nceptor (GR) and is therefore critical for the regulation of the stress \nresponse. In order to act as a GR regulator, our group has demon -\nstrated that FKBP51 has to be SUMOylated, a process enhanced \nby cellular stress. FKBP51 also acts as a metabolic sensor playing \nan important role in energy and metabolic homeostasis. At the brain \nlevel, the hypothalamus has a central role in the control of body ho -\nmeostasis, neuroendocrine outputs, and feeding behaviour. It does \nso by sensing and integrating signals from the periphery and ef -\nfecting appropriate physiological changes. Hypothalamic FKBP51 is \ninduced by fasting, and elevated hypothalamic expression promotes \nobese phenotypes. Interestingly, several studies have described a \nrole for hypothalamic autophagy in the control of food intake and \nenergy balance. At the molecular level, FKBP51 has been shown \nto bind Beclin1 and alter its phosphorylation status, promoting the \ninduction of the autophagy pathway. It does so by interacting with \nPHLPP and AKT1 and thereby favouring AKT\u2019s dephosphorylation, \nwhich leads to Beclin1 recruitment and dephosphorylation. Further -\nmore, synthetic glucocorticoids and antidepressants act synergis -\ntically with FKBP51 in the induction of autophagy. Our preliminary \nwestern blot results show that FKBP51 expression is up-regulated \nupon starvation in the GT1-7 hypothalamic cell line (35.5\u00b13.3%, \np<0.05). This correlates with decreased phosphorylation of AKT1 \nand Beclin1 (p-AKT1: 61.2\u00b1 8.1%, p<0.05; p-beclin1: 77.3\u00b14.5% \np<0.05) and with the induction of autophagy markers measured by \nwestern blot assays (42.6\u00b14.2%, p<0.05). Also, we demonstrate by \nco-immunoprecipitation assays that FKBP51 interaction with AKT1 \nand Beclin1 is dependent on FKBP51 SUMOylation, suggesting that \nSUMO conjugation to FKBP51 may have an impact in the regulation \nof the autophagic pathway in this context.\nONCOLOG\u00cdA\n223.

Gomez, Diego Mengual G\u00f3mez. \nCentro de Oncologia Molecular y Traslacional - UNQ\nThe Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1(PIN1) \nis currently the only enzyme described with the ability to recognize \nand isomerize the phosphorylated Serine/Threonine-Proline (pSer/\nThr-Pro) motif. Through this mechanism, PIN1 has the ability to reg -\nulate the structure of a subset of proteins, and consequently con -\ntrols diverse cellular functions. Thus, both PIN1 overexpression as \nits involvement in various oncogenic pathways has been reported in \nseveral cancers types, including glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is char -\nacterized as a complex and lethal disease with limited therapeutic \nresources so far. Due to the need to develop new therapies, there is \nan interest to explore the role of PIN1 in glioblastoma progression. \nHowever, studies on the contribution of this protein in glioblastoma \nare limited. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the contribution \nof PIN1 in a glioblastoma progression using LN229 cells, seeking to \nvalidate this protein as a molecular target. With this objective, we de -\nveloped a Pin1 K.O. (knockOut) LN229 cell variant using CRISPR/\nCas9 technology. Both, Pin1 K.O. and wildtype models were com -\npared in different cellular processes related to tumor progression \nsuch as: cell migration by transwell assays, cell cycle progression by \npropidium iodide staining and cytometry, doubling time by colorimet -\nric quantification and finally, in vivo tumor progression xenografts. \nResults revealed that lack of PIN1 expression in glioblastoma cells \nsuppressed their malignant phenotype by reducing migration, cell \ncycle progression, and increasing doubling time. Furthermore, Pin1 \ndeletion also resulted in the loss of LN229 ability to form tumors in \nnude mice. These results highlight PIN1 contribution in glioblastoma \nprogression, in turn, validating this protein as an attractive molecular \ntarget for development of novel glioblastoma treatments.\n224.

Argentina.\nIt is well-known that most of cancer cells present an increased gly -\ncolytic flow related to their metabolic reprogramming (Tanner et al., \n2018). This metabolic change, considered an emerging hallmark of \ncancer, conduces to an exacerbated lactate secretion and produces \nlarge amounts of protons. We have previously demonstrated that \nthe inhibition of Hv1, an ion channel capable to extrude H+ of cells, \ninduces intracellular acidification and apoptosis in leukemic Jurkat T \ncells (Asuaje et al., 2018). In this work we present evidences show -\ning that Jurkat T cells cultivated in presence of high (25 mM) glucose \nconcentration increases (15%, p<0.01; N=9) lactate secretion per \ncell (commercial kit) compared with the cells cultivated in physiolog -\nic (5.5 mM) glucose concentration, suggesting that, the high glucose \nconcentration in the culture medium increases the glycolytic flow. \nThen, we studied in deep the role of Hv1 channel in this metabolic \ncontext observing that the cells cultivated in presence of glucose 25 \nmM increases Hv1 channel activity (3 fold of ion current increment, \np<0.001, N=10) measured by patch clamp technique; intracellular \npH (0.12 units of pH increment, p<0.01, N=2) determined by using \nBCECF-AM prove; and cell proliferation (20% of increment, p<0.01, \nN=3. Doubling time). Moreover, when the same parameters were \nevaluated in presence of a specific Hv1 channel blocker (ClGBI, \n200 \u00b5M), we found that ClGBI produced a drop of intracellular pH \n(p<0.01, N=2), a slight decrease of extracellular lactate concentra -\ntion (25%, p<0.05 vs. DMSO 0.2%, N=4) and a significantly increase \nof cell death (p<0.05, anexineV-IP). These results suggest that high \nconcentration of glucose induces an increment of glycolytic rate and \ncell proliferation in Jurkat T cells, and both of them were diminished \nby Hv1 inhibition, showing a relevant function of Hv1 channel in the \nmetabolic change of these cells.225.

In a previous study, we showed that the deriva -\ntive containing the dipeptide Leu-Phe (TAP7f) triggers a n endoplas -\nmic reticulum (ER) stress response, induces apoptosis and activates \np38, JNK and PI3K/AKT pathways in murine B16-F0 melanoma \ncells. In order to investigate the role of these signaling cascades in \nthe mechanism of action of TAP7f, B16-F0 cells were transfected \nwith specific mutant dominant negative constructs or control vectors \nand treated with TAP7f. Results showed an increase in cell prolifer -\nation from 26\u00b13% (control vector) to 42\u00b14, 36\u00b13, 38\u00b14% after trans -\nfecting cells with p38, JNK or PI3K-I dominant negative mutants, \nrespectively (*p<0.05). We further examined whether the activation \nof p38 and JNK pathways was related to the ER stress response. To \nthis end, MAPKs phosphorylation levels were determined by West -\nern blot after pre-incubation with AICAR, an ER stress inhibitor. Our \nresults revealed that p38 and JNK activation was markedly reduced \nafter treating AICAR pre-incubated cells with the penicillin deriva -\ntive. On the other hand, we evaluated whether PI3K-I/AKT pathway \nwas involved in the apoptotic response induced by TAP7f. After cell \ntransfection with the PI3K-I dominant negative vector, a significant \nrecovery of full-length PARP-1 and an almost complete decrease \nof Bax levels were observed compared to cells transfected with the \ncontrol vector. In  summary, our results suggested that PI3K/AKT ac -\ntivation together with JNK and p38 MAPKs contribute to the apoptot -\nic cell death induced by TAP7f. We also demonstrated that JNK and \np38 MAPK are activated downstream the ER stress response. The \nknowledge of the role played by the intracellular signals that regulate \ncell death could certainly contribute to find new intracellular targets \nfor melanoma treatment.\n226.

Ro -\nffo, Universidad de Buenos Aires\nIntroduction: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and ag -\ngressive brain tumor. Despite the introduction of chemotherapy with \ntemozolomide (TMZ), the survival does not exceed 2 years. Cancer \nstem cells (CSC) has been associated to tumor recurrence. On the \nother hand, it has been suggested that iNOS (inducible nitric oxide \nsynthase isoform) enzyme can sustain the CSC niche.\nObjective:  Evaluate the expression of iNOS and the effect of its \ninhibitor, S-methylisothiourea (SMT), alone or in combination with \nTMZ, on the development of CSC on human GBM cell lines.\nMethodology:  Human GBM lines LN229, U251 and U87 were \nseeded in monolayer (2D) and under spheral (3D) conditions (low \nadhesion and high dilution). Viability in 2D was determined by MTS. \nThe number of CSC was established by sphere forming efficien -\ncy (SFE) in relation to the seeded cells, and the diameter of the \nspheres was measured. iNOS expression was determined by im -\nmunofluorescence.\nResults:  The three lines expressed iNOS. In 2D, SMT (50 \u00b5M) only \nreduced LN229 cell line growth (26% inhibition); however, in 3D, \nit decreased SFE in the three lines (inhibition, LN229 42%; U251 \n61%; U87 48%) and their diameters (inhibition, 33%, 17% and 28%, \nrespectively). The combination of SMT with TMZ 250 \u00b5M, further \ninhibited SFE (LN229 57%, U251 70%, U87 50%) compared to SMT \nor TMZ alone.\nConclusion:  iNOS inhibition in combination of actual TMZ therapy, \ncould be a useful reducing chemotherapy-resistant CSC. Further \nstudies on the mechanisms of action will allow establish the differ -\nences observed between GBM cell lines.\n228.

The standard treatment depends on several \nfactors including stage, histology and expression of molecular mark -\ners. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy are mechanisms that facilitate \ntumor resection and chemotherapy (CT) is a widely approach used \nmany times as concomitant neoadjuvant therapy with radio, endo -\ncrine or immunotherapy. Cancer Stem Cells (CSC) are a minority \ntumor cell population, associated to the lack of treatment response. \nThe development of an in vitro  assay that can predict treatment re -\nsponse and that could be useful for patients with this pathology is an \nimportant issue. Objective: Evaluate CSC response post-treatment \nCT drugs like doxorubicin (Doxo) and paclitaxel (Ptx) using a mu -\nrine BC mixed cell line (LM38-LP). Results: Through a cell viability \nassay in monolayer, measured by MTS, IC50 values were obtained, \nbeing 1,5 \u00b5M for Doxo and 0,5 \u00b5M for Ptx. Cancer sphere forming \nassay in low-attachment conditions, an accepted method for CSC \nquantification, was carried out with or without Doxo or Ptx. Both CT \ncompounds decreased the number of CSCs, measured as sphere \nformation efficiency (p<0,0005), spheres size by an average of 30% \n(p<0,005) and decreased the remained  survived cells  by 65% with \nDoxo and 35% with Ptx (p <0,005).  Histological study of spheres \nrevealed that both, CT drugs generated a more disintegrated and \neosinophilic structure regarding control. Also, doxo or Ptx induced \nan increase of pluripotent markers Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog by qPCR \n(p<0,0001 vs control). Conclusion: Both drugs have inhibited the number of CSC, their survival rate, but have increased their  plurip -\notent capacity. An in vivo assay analysing tumoral spheres growth \nrate under these treatments, will give us relevant information about \ntheir tumorigenic potential.\n229.

Since these molecules may be in -\nvolved in the promotion of melanoma angiogenesis, we further ex -\nplored the antiangiogenic effect of TAP7f. In this sense, we found \nthat in HMEC-1 human endothelial cells, TAP7f inhibited cell pro -\nliferation (IC50 23\u00b14 \u00b5M, 72h) and also cell migration by 36\u00b18% \n(5 \u00b5M, p<0.001) and 52\u00b15% (10 \u00b5M, p<0.0001) after 24 h of incu -\nbation. The penicillin derivative also blocked endothelial cell tube \nformation (75\u00b13%, 18 h, p<0.0001) and altered actin cytoskeleton \norganization. It must be noted that all assays employed TAP7f in \nnon-cytotoxic conditions. When gel plug assays were performed, \nTAP7f inhibited the neovascularization induced by 250 ng/ml of fi -\nbroblast growth factor 8 days after plug implantation in C57/BL6J \nmice. Furthermore, when B16-F10 metastatic melanoma cells were \ninjected intradermally in these mice, we observed a decrease in tu -\nmor vascularization after a daily treatment with 10 mg/kg of TAP7f \nfor 5 days. Moreover, we found that TAP7f (10 \u00b5M) reduced VEGF \n(vascular endothelial growth factor) expression levels (63.7\u00b14%, 24 \nh, p<0.0001) in B16-F10 cells. When we evaluated TAP7f in vivo \nantitumor effect in a mouse melanoma model employing B16-F10 \ncells, we observed a reduction of ~50% (p<0.001) in tumor volume \n(5 doses of 20 mg/kg for 2 weeks). Additionally, tumor tissues from \nTAP7f-treated mice stained with anti-CD31 antibody exhibited a de -\ncreased number of endothelial cells and Western blot analysis of \ntumor lysates showed that TAP7f downregulated VEGF expression \n(68\u00b16%, p<0.001).\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that TAP7f not only exerts antitu -\nmor and antimetastatic effects, but also behaves as an antiangio -\ngenic agent. These features position this penicillin derivative as a \npromising agent for melanoma treatment.\n230. (25) IN VIVO  PHOTOTOXIC ACTION OF A CATIONIC Zn(II) \nPHTHALOCYANINE IN A MURINE MELANOMA MODEL\nValli F, Garc\u00eda Vior MC, Roguin LP, Marino VJ\nInstituto de Qu\u00edmica y Fisicoqu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gicas (IQUIFIB) \u2013 \nUBA/CONICET. Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica, Facul -\ntad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidad de Buenos Aires.\nMelanoma is the most aggressive form of skin carcinoma, highly \nresistant to traditional therapies. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an \nalternative modality, which combines a photosensitizer, visible light \nand molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species that se -\nlectively destroy target tissues. We have previously demonstrated \nthat the cationic Zn(II) phthalocyanine Pc13 is a potent photosensi -\ntizer that promotes cell death after irradiation in a panel of melano -\nma cell lines.\nIn order to evaluate the in vivo  efficacy of PDT with Pc13, we em -MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020114\nployed a syngeneic model of C57BL/6 mice bearing subcutaneous \nB16F0 melanoma tumors. First, Pc13 biodistribution was examined \nafter intratumoral administration using an in vivo imaging system. \nWe found that maximum retention of the photosensitizer in the tumor \nwas reached at 3 h post administration. Moreover, the presence of \nPc13 in liver, intestines and kidneys suggested possible elimination \npathways of this phthalocyanine. Laser irradiation (250 J/cm2) after \n3 h of intratumoral injection of 2 mg/kg Pc13 significantly reduced \ntumor volume at the end of the experiment (65%, p<0.01), com -\npared to control groups. Body weight and histological characteristics \nof different tissues stained with hematoxylin-eosin were not altered \nin treated-mice, indicating non-toxicity of Pc13-PDT. Histological \nanalyses of tumor sections showed a marked increase of necrotic \nareas (57% vs. 5%) and a reduction of PCNA staining after treat -\nment. Furthermore, increased levels of Bax, active caspase 3 and \ndiminished expression of Bcl-2 were observed in treated-tumors by \nWestern Blot and immunofluorescence assays, indicating apoptotic \ncell death. In addition, higher levels of LC3-II and Beclin-1 demon -\nstrated the participation of an autophagic response after Pc13-PDT.\nIn conclusion, our results showed that PDT with Pc13 is a promising \nand non-toxic antitumor modality for melanoma treatment that effi -\nciently induces cell death and reduces tumor growth in vivo .\n231. (26) CDU/5-FC SUICIDE GENE BYSTANDER EFFECT IS \nMEDIATED BY 5-FU AND ENZYME CODING INFORMA -\nTION IN HUMAN MELANOMA CELL LINES\nBernabei-Cornejo SG1, P\u00e1ez AV1, Glikin GC1, Finocchiaro \nLME1\n1. Unidad de Transferencia Gen\u00e9tica, \u00c1rea Investigaci\u00f3n, \nInstituto de Oncolog\u00eda \u201c\u00c1ngel H. Roffo\u201d, Universidad de Bue -\nnos Aires.\nBackground: The yeast cytosine deaminase::uracil phosphoribosyl \ntransferase (CDU) fusion protein [associated to its prodrug 5-fluoro -\ncytosine (5-FC)], was proposed as a suicide gene (SG) therapy ap -\nproach for human melanoma. Previously, we reported the cytotoxic \neffects of this system on 4 melanoma cell lines (A375, hM1, hM4, \nhM9). Here, we extended the study to 4 additional cell lines (hM2, \nhM10, SB2 and M8). \nObjective: To explore the mechanisms  enhancing the cytotoxic ef -\nfects of  CDU/5-FC SG system on human melanoma cells. \nMethods: Dose-response experiments for 5-FC and 5-fluorouracyl \n(5-FU) were performed on CDU lipofected and unlipofected cells, \nrespectively. Conditioned medium (CM) from CDU lipofected cells \nwas obtained after 48 h incubation with or without 5-FC. Cell surviv -\nal was determined by the acid phosphatase assay and proliferative \ncapacity of SG surviving cells by colony formation assay. \nResults: A 5-FC concentration dependent decrease in CDU-lipofect -\ned cells viability was observed (p<0.05). The SG system mimicked \n5-FU effects on cell viability. The two SG-resistant cell lines (hM2 and \nhM10) were also less susceptible to 5-FU. The clonogenic capacity \nof CDU-lipofected surviving cells was strongly diminished when they \nwere pretreated with 10 \u00b5M 5-FC (p<0.05) and completely abolished \nwith 100 \u00b5M 5-FC or 5-FU (p<0.01). Analyzing the contribution of the \nCDU/5FC-treated cells released factors to the bystander effect, we \nfound that 5-FU accounted for most of the CM citotoxicity. Interest -\ningly, the CDU and/or CDU-coding information was also delivered to \nthe CM. Thus, when CM recipient cells were exposed to 5-FC, it was \nactivated by CDU, resulting in cell death (p<0.05).\nConclusion: The CDU/5-FC SG therapy system appears as a prom -\nising adjuvant treatment for advanced melanoma. Its bystander ef -\nfect is attributable to 5-FU and enzyme-coding information released \nby lipofected cells. Further studies are needed to assess the nature \nof all the molecule(s) involved.\n232. (32) IN VITRO COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF HSVTK/GCV \nAND CD::UPRT/5FC SUICIDE GENE SYSTEMS IN CELL \nDYNAMICS OF CANINE MELANOMA CELL LINES.\nPaez AV1, Agnetti L1, Allende JB1, Bernabei-Cornejo SG1, Gli-\nkin GC1, Finocchiaro LME1. \n1Unidad de Transferencia Gen\u00e9tica, \u00c1rea Investigaci\u00f3n, Ins -\ntituto de Oncolog\u00eda \u201c\u00c1ngel H. Roffo\u201d, Universidad de Buenos \nAires.Our group demonstrated the efficacy of herpes simplex virus thy -\nmidine kinase/ ganciclovir (HSVtk/GCV) suicide gene (SG) for local \ncontrol of canine melanoma in a clinical setting.\nAim: As a preclinical study to improve the antitumor efficacy of gene \ntherapy, we explore the in vitro  effectiveness of the SG system \ncytosine deaminase/uracil phosphoribosyl transferase fusion en -\nzyme (CDU::UPRT, CDU) and its prodrug 5-FC (5-fluorocytosine; \nCDU/5FC).\nMethods: Prodrug concentration-response experiments were per -\nformed on lipofected cells (monolayers and spheroids) in 3 canine \nmelanoma cell lines derived from veterinary patient tumors. Cell vi -\nability was measured 5 days post-lipofection by the acid phosphate \nassay (APH) and clonogenic survival 7 days after reseeding cells \nby Chrystal Violet staining. Cell death mechanism was determined \nwith acridine orange/ ethidium bromide (AO/EB) and extracellular \nvesicles (EVs) in the conditioned media (CM) were isolated by 500 \nxg; 2k xg and 12k xg centrifugation.\nResults: The canine melanoma cells were very sensitive to both SG \nsystems in both spatial configurations (p<0.05) and surviving cells to \nboth SG treatments showed a significant decrease in their clonogen -\nic capacity (p<0.001). AO/EB cell staining showed that during the \nprocess of apoptosis, there was an accumulation of vesicles in the \nperinuclear region and cell periphery. This happened at 24 h in cells \nexposed to CDU/5-FC, and at 48 h in HSVtk/GCV exposed cells. \nWhen isolated by differential centrifugation of their respective CM, \nthe 500-2200 nm vesicles were the most toxic fractions from HSVtk/\nGCV cells (p<0.0001), while the highest cytotoxicity from CDU/5-\nFC lipofected cells\u00b4 CM was in the fraction containing 30-150 nm \nvesicles (p<0.001). \nConclusions: The present work shows that CD/5FC has a differential \neffect on cell dynamics and its bystander cell death is mediated by \nthe release of small vesicles and 5-FU, supporting CDU/5-FC as a \ncandidate for a novel in vivo  protocol.\n233.

It com -\nprises a group of tumors of different lineage and biological behavior. \nAbout half of TC are driven by an acquired activating mutation in \nthe BRAF oncogene. While targeted therapies have improved out -\ncomes in melanoma patients, most TC patients become resistant or \nrecur suggesting that new or additive non-cross-reactive therapies \nare needed. We have previously shown that PKCa mediates TSH \nand thyroid hormones proliferative effects in TC. Recent evidence \nindicates that together PKCa overexpression and BRAF mutation \nshould contribute to tumorigenesis and resistance to anticancer \ntherapies. We found that by inhibiting BRAF expression with RNAi in \nanaplastic TC cells with BRAF mutation, PKCa expression decreas -\nes as well, suggesting that the latter is found downstream of BRAF. \nFurthermore, a decrease in the expression of the cell proliferation \nmarker PCNA was observed in BRAF-depleted cells by western \nblot analysis. Also, TC cells were sensitive to increasing doses of \nthe BRAF inhibitor widely used in the clinic vemurafenib/PLX4032 \nin a dose-dependent manner (p<0.0001) by Cell Titer Blue (CTB) \nassay. To begin to study the combined inhibition of PKC and BRAF, \nCTB assays were performed with increasing doses of vemurafenib \nin presence or absence of the PKC inhibitor GF109203X at selec -\ntive concentrations in follicular TC cells carrying BRAF mutation. We \nconfirmed the dose-dependency of vemurafenib and found that the \ncombination leads to a significant decrease in cell viability (p<0.5). \nOur results establish that the effective dual PKCa and BRAF block -\nade can significantly drive tumor proliferation inhibition. The results ABSTRACTS115\nobtained could provide new therapeutic targets and alternatives to \nthe treatments currently used for this disease. Despite its increasing \nincidence and mortality in many cases, TC constitutes a very poorly \nstudied area in our country.\n234.

Roffo, \u00c1rea Investigaci\u00f3n, \nUniversidad de Buenos Aires.\nGlypican-3 (GPC3) is a proteoglycan downregulated in breast tu -\nmors. P reviously, we showed that GPC3 prevents metastatic spread \nand regulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), sug -\ngesting its role as metastasis suppressor. However, events underly -\ning this modulation have not completely described yet. \nThe aim of this study was to examine the effects of GPC3 on cell \nmorphology and adhesion patterns, as well as on the expression \nof molecules associated with these properties. We employed hu -\nman cell lines genetically modified. We silenced GPC3 expression in \nMCF-7 cells, while it was over expressed in MDA-MB231.\nOur results showed that GPC3 expressing cells exhibit an epithe -\nlial phenotype and reorganize their actin cytoskeleton. By phalloi -\ndin-FITC staining, we observed that GPC3 expressing cells lose \ntheir stress fibers and place the actin in a cortical ring. We also \nchecked the expression of linage markers by WB. We found higher \nlevels of the epithelial marker E-cadherin in GPC3 expressing cells, \nwhile the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin was re -\nduced.\nWe evaluated whether GPC3 modulates the cell adhesion to ex -\ntracellular matrix components, showing that it impairs the ability of \nMDA-MB231 cells to adhere to FN (p<0.001, ANOVA Bonferroni\u00b4s \ntests) and LN (p<0.0001), as well as to plastic (p<0.0001). On the \nother hand, the GPC3 silencing did not change the adhesion of \nMCF-7 cells either to FN or plastic, but reduced their adherence to \nLN (p<0.001). We also analyzed the expression of adhesion pro -\nteins by WB. Supporting our results, we found that MDA-MB231-\nGPC3 cells have lower \u03b21 and \u03b24-integrin levels, while no significant \nchanges were found in MCF-7 sublines.\nIn sum, here we demonstrated that GPC3 modifies several tumor \ncell properties, like morphology, cytoskeleton organization and ad -\nhesion, and modulates proteins related to these processes. Alto -\ngether, our results support the key role of GPC3 in the EMT regula -\ntion, and then breast tumor progression.\n235.

Here, we show that lentiviral-mediated overexpression \nof TGFBR2-SE, a recently discovered soluble isoform of the human \nTGF-\u03b2 type 2 receptor, fused to the human IgG1 Fc fragment (TG -\nFBR2-SE/Fc) reduces in vitro  cell proliferation and migration while \ninduces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the primary human col -\norectal cancer-derived cell line HCT116. Moreover, TGFBR2-SE/\nFc impairs tumorigenicity of BALB/c nude athymic mice xenografts, \nincreasing the survival rate of the animals. Tumors overexpressing \nTGFBR2-SE/Fc were considerable smaller or even unable to be \nestablished as only 3 out of 6 mice developed tumors in the TGF -\nBR2-SE/Fc group. Mechanistically, TGFBR2-SE/Fc downregulates \nTGF-\u03b2 canonical pathway and leads to the activation of tumor sup -\npressor genes such as p21, p57 and p53, as well as to the inacti -vation of cell cycle progression elements such as cyclin B1 and Id1. \nThese findings suggest a strong antitumor activity of TGFBR2-SE/\nFc based on blocking TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and Smad2/3- inde -\npendent changes in gene expression supporting the further explora -\ntion and development of TGFBR2-SE/Fc as a new biopharmaceuti -\ncal for the treatment of solid tumors.\n236.

Previously, we demonstrated that \nMCT with CY+LOS, in M-234p and M-406 tumor models, caused in -\nhibition of tumor growth, increase of survival rate and was devoid of \ntoxicity. We aimed to analyze the structural and morphologic chang -\nes in M-234p and M-406 vasculature after MCT with CY+LOS. Mice \nwere challenged with each tumor (Day 0). On days 31 (M-234p) \nand 22 (M-406) tumor samples were taken from: 1) CONTROL: with \ntumor and no treatment, 2) TREATED: with tumor and treated in the \ndrinking water, from days 5 and 8, respectively, with 2a) CY (25mg/\nkg/day), 2b) LOS (200mg/kg/day) and 2c) CY+LOS as 2a+2b. Sam -\nples were fixed, paraffin embedded, cut in 5\u03bcm slices and stained \nwith H&E. The capillaries in CONTROL group showed a circumfer -\nentially incomplete inner lining layer of small cells, flattened nuclei, \nmarked intercellular gaps and an underlying sheet of very thin and \ninterrupted connective tissue. No pericytes were observed around \nthe capillaries. Samples from CY+LOS group showed intra and per -\nitumoral capillaries with structure and morphology similar to normal \npatterns in tissues without tumor. Endothelial cells provided a contin -\nuous and uninterrupted linning, with a well-defined basal membrane \ncovered by pericytes. Samples from 2a and 2b tumors were similar \nto CONTROL group. Results were similar for M-234p and M-406 tu -\nmors. The CY+LOS treatment produced modifications of tumor vas -\nculature consisting of normalization of tumor vessels that showed a \nmorphology similar to normal mammary tissue. This changes may \nreduce hypoxia, increase tumor oxygenation, leading to a better de -\nlivery of drugs and a better therapeutic outcome for triple negative \nmammary tumors.\n237.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) trans -\nporters are transmembrane proteins that translocate low molecu -\nlar weight molecules through ATP hydrolysis.We have previously \nshown that ACSL4 is involved in resistance to chemotherapeutic \nagents by regulating the expression of transporters; thus, the objec -\ntive of this work was to study the effect of chemotherapeutic agents \non ACSL4 and resistance mechanisms. The experimental mod -MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020116\nel consisted in the chemotherapeutic challenge of adrenal cancer \nNCI-H295R and breast cancer MCF-7 cells, two lines characterized \nby low aggressive phenotypes and low expression of the ACSL4, \nABCG2 and ABCC4 proteins. We evaluated cell functionality using \nproliferation (BrdU) and viability (MTT) assays, and compound ex -\nclusion (efflux) using fluorescent Hoechst 33342. ACSL4 and ABC \ntransporters were evaluated by western blot (WB). NCI-H295R cell \ntreatment with doxorubicin (20 nM) and cisplatin (200 nM) increased \nthe expression of ACSL4 (WB-p <0.001), ABCG2 (WB-p <0.001) \nand ABCC4 (WB-p <0.05). The treatments also improved fluores -\ncent compound exclusion (efflux-p <0.01), an effect reversed by the \naction of ABGC2 transporter inhibitor KO143. Combined treatments \n(chemotherapeutic agents and ACSL4 inhibitor) reduced the prolif -\neration of NCI-H295R cells (BrdU-p <0.05). MCF-7 cell treatment \nwith doxorubicin and cisplatin increased the expression of ACSL4 \n(WB-p <0.001) and ABCG2 (WB-p <0.05) and the phosphoryla -\ntion of pAKT (WB-p <0.05) and pS6 (WB-p <0.01), components of \nthe AKT/mTOR pathway. These results are in line with our previous \nobservation that ACSL4 regulates ABGC2 expression through the \nregulation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Therefore, ACSL4 may con -\nstitute a therapeutic target at the initial stages of chemotherapeutic \ntreatment to prevent the activation of pathways associated with in -\ncreased tumor aggressiveness.\n238.

Lucero\u201d, Bah\u00eda Blanca, Argentina.\n \nPrevious work from our group shows that Hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) \nis overexpressed in several types of tumor and the enzyme can be \nlocated in cell cytoplasm and/or nucleus. This subcellular distribu -\ntion is caused by the cleavage of the C-terminus of HO-1 by calpain \n1 (CAPN1), calpain 2 (CAPN2), cathepsin B (CTSB) and signal pep -\ntide peptidase (SPP). In thyroid cancer (TC), HO-1 potential utility as \nbiomarker remains underexplored. The aim of this work was to study \nHO-1 expression in TC and its correlation with clinical-pathological \ndata. Tumor biopsies (N=64) and fine needle aspiration biopsies \n(FNAB) (N=22) were used to asses HO-1 expression by inmuno -\nhistochemistry (IHC) and inmunocytochemistry (ICC),  respectively. \nIn addition, mRNA expression of HO-1, CAPN1, CAPN2, CTSB and \nSPP were analyzed by using GEPIA2 and Kaplan-Meier Plotter da -\ntabases in in silico  assays. In TC biopsies, overexpression (OE) of \nHO-1 by IHC was found in the tumor (T) respect to non-malignant \nareas to the tumor (NMT) (Mann Whitney test, p<0.0001). In T, HO-1 \nwas expressed in the cytoplasm while in NMT, nuclear expression \nwas found. HO-1 expression correlated with histological subtype \nby IHC (Chi2, p=0.0006) and Bethesda classification by ICC (Chi2, \np=0.0470). In silico  studies (ISS) corroborated IHC results in papil -\nlary TC (ANOVA, p<0.001). Stage IV female patients with HO-1 OE \nwere associated with lower overall survival (Log rank, p=0.032). ISS \nshowed that stage III male patients with OE of CTSB and female pa -\ntients with OE of CAPN1 correlated with greater survival (Log rank, \np=0.017; Log rank, p=0.027 respectively). However, in female and \nmale stage IV patients, OE of CAPN2 was associated with lower \nsurvival (Log rank, p=0.0015; Log rank, p=0.039 respectively). Fur -\nthermore, SPP OE correlated with lower survival in female patients \n(Log rank, p=0.041). So far our results show that HO-1, CAPN2 and \nSPP overexpression together could be used as unfavorable bio -markers in TC.\n239.

Also, treatments \nwith each single compound were made (IFN-group and E-group). \nMTT assay was performed to determine cell viability at 72 h of treat -\nment; wound healing assay was done at 24 h to determine cell mi -\ngration. Invasion studies at 24 h were made in transwell chambers, \nand annexin v/propidium iodide assay was performed to determine \napoptosis at 72 h. As expected, IFN-E-group showed a higher de -\ncrease in cell viability (-70%*#) compared with monodrug therapy: \nIFN-group (-10%*), E-group (-15%*). IFN-E-group displayed a sig -\nnificant decrease (-44%*#) in migratory activity compared with each \nindividual treatment: IFN-group (-21%*) and E-group (-22%*). Also, \nIFN-E-group showed a significant diminution (-75%*#) in cell inva -\nsiveness compared with monodrug therapy: IFN-group (-25%*) and \nE-group (-55%*). Finally, IFN-E-group showed a higher increase in \ntotal apoptosis (+160%*#) compared with individual therapy: IFN-\ngroup (-40%*) and E-group (-43%*),(*p\u22640.05 vs. control untreated \ncells; #p\u22640.05 vs IFN-group and E-group). In summary, we demon -\nstrate that the addition of \u03b4-tocotrienol to IFN \u03b1 therapy enhances \nthe reduction of cell proliferation and migration/invasiveness capac -\nities of Huh7 cells, as well as potentiates the increase in apoptot -\nic cell death. In this regard, combined treatment of immunochem -\nicals together with natural products, might open a potential clinical \naproach for HCC treatment in the future.\n240.

Up to 25% of children and more than 50% \nof adults suffer a relapse of the disease which significantly reduces \npatient\u2019s survival. Therefore, it is important to identify new biomark -\ners, which can be used to improve the disease prognosis and/or \nto predict treatment efficacy. Non-coding RNAs have been shown \nto play a key role in the development and progression of tumors. \nRecent studies point out that aberrant miR-34a and miR-137 ex -\npression leads to an increase in cell proliferation, as well as an ab -\nnormal response to chemotherapy in various types of cancer. Thus, \nwe aimed to elucidate the role of this two microRNAs in ALL, specif -\nically to study their association to tumor development and disease ABSTRACTS117\nprogression. To achieve this goal, we first analyzed the expression \nof these two microRNAs in B-ALL and T-ALL cell lines, using normal \nlymphoid cells as controls. We found lower expression of miR-34a \nand miR-137 by RT-qPCR in cancer cell lines compared to control \ncells. Furthermore, we studied the main proteins regulated by these \nnon-coding RNAs: SIRT1 and LSD1. We demonstrated by Western \nBlot that SIRT1 and LSD1 levels were significantly higher in ALL \ncell lines. Finally, we overexpressed miR34a in the ALL cell lines by \ntransfection with an expression vector in order to confirm that the \nlower expression of this microRNA is associated with the tumoral \nphenotype. The restored levels of miR-34a resulted in a downreg -\nulation of SIRT1 protein levels and cell proliferation. Thus, these \nnovel results provide new insight into ALL cell biology. Furthermore, \nthese results encourage us to continue studying the role of miR-34a \nand miR-137 as an early diagnostic molecule or a possible effective \ntarget for disease treatment.\n241.

However, most studies have focused \non linking obesity and cancer, ignoring changes on normal adipo -\ncytes. Therefore, we retrieved microarray data from a GEO data -\nset (GSE95827) to analyse transcriptional changes in 3T3-L1 \nadipocytes after 3 days of co-culture with MCF7 (Ad+MCF) or MDA-\nMB-231 breast cancer cell (Ad+MDA). \nBy GEO2R tool, we determined 245 up-regulated genes in Ad+MCF7 \nand 215 in Ad+MDA compared to adipocytes alone (p<0.01), but \nonly 68 of them overlapped between conditions. Gene Ontology \nAnalysis was performed and showed that the biological process en -\nrichment is completely different between MDA-MB-231 and MCF7-\nco-cultured adipocytes. Even more, co-culture with MDA-MB-231 \ncells enriched adipocytes with genes involved in Cellular response \nto interleukin-6 (GO:0071354) and Positive regulation of NIK/NF- kB \nsignaling (GO:1901224), both related to inflammation. Transcription \nfactors (TF) analysis by ISMARA platform predicted that NF- kB fam -\nily members had the highest activity in Ad+MDA. To verify this result, \nwe performed immunofluorescence assays detecting the presence \nof phosphorylated NF- kB subunit p65. MDA-MB-231 cells signifi -\ncantly led to a higher fluorescence intensity in adipocyte nuclei than \nMCF7 did when compared to basal condition. Moreover, mRNA lev -\nels of NF- kB targets as cxcl1,  cxcl5, il6 obtained  from the analysed \ndataset were found up-regulated in Ad+MDA respect to adipocytes \nalone (p<0.05). Interestingly, expression levels of Il6 family mem -\nbers (Il6 and Il11) were up-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cell line com -\npared to MCF7 cells in three different public datasets, which could \nexplain NF- kB activation only in Ad+MDA.\nThese results suggest that breast cancer cells stimulate adjacent \nadipocytes in different ways leading or not to inflammation in adi -\npocytes. \n242.

It is still unknown how these cells contribute to the \nprogression of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal \ncarcinoma (IDC). Some works suggest that TGF-\u03b21 pathway may \nbe involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and confer stem \ncell properties to DCIS cells. This implies that this pathway might be a potential pathological mechanism which drives the progression of \nDCIS into IDC.\nThe cellular model LM38 consists of three cell lines: LM38-LP (MEP \nand LEP), LM38-HP (LEP) and LM38-D2 (MEP). Previously, we \ndescribed that only the bi-cellular LM38-LP cell line was able to \ndevelop in situ tumors after intraductal injections, suggesting that \ncell interaction could confer an advantage for tumor formation and \nprogression. Moreover, we showed that treatment with conditioned \nmedium of LM38-D2 induced viability on LM38-LP cells.\nThe analysis of TGF-\u03b21 expression in the LM38 model showed \nhigher levels of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA in LM38-D2 compared to LM38-\nLP (qPCR, p<0.01). LM38 cells were treated with a recombinant \nTGF-\u03b21 (1ng/\u00b5l) and an inhibitor of the TGF-\u03b21 receptor SB431542 \n(10 and 20\u00b5M). We could observe that TGF-\u03b21 treatment increased \n40 per cent the viability of LM38-LP compared to the control, which \nis reduced in presence of SB431542 (crystal violet assay, p<0.05, \np<0.001).\nWhen evaluating TGF-\u03b21 expression in LM38 fat pad tumors we ob -\nserved that tumors generated by LM38-D2 showed higher expres -\nsion levels on TGF-\u03b21 than LM38-LP (IHQ, p=0,01). Expression of \nTGF-\u03b21 presented an heterogeneous pattern in LM38-LP tumors \nwhich requires further characterization.\nIn conclusion, TGF-\u03b21 could be one of the factors implicated in the \nLEP-MEP dialogue. These results suggest that TGF-\u03b21 could play \nan important role in cellular cooperation in early stages of breast \ncancer.\n243.

Instituto de Investigaciones Hematol\u00f3gicas, Academia Na -\ncional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nCML is a myeloproliferative neoplasia whose first-line therapy are \nBCR-ABL inhibitors such as Imatinib (IM). CD44 levels correlates \nwith bad response to therapy. Previously, we demonstrated that \nhyaluronic acid (HA) abrogates IM-induced senescence, while the \ninhibition of its synthesis with 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) has a \nsynergistic effect with IM on CML cells growth. The aim of this work \nwas to obtain an IM resistant K562 derivate cell line and to study the \nresistance mechanisms involved, as well as, the effect of 4MU treat -\nment. The Ki562 cells were obtained after culturing K562 cells with \nincreasing doses of IM from 0.1\u00b5M up to 1\u00b5M. Control cells derivate \nof K562, Ko562, were kept in culture presenting the same aging but, \nwithout selection pressure of IM. None of these cells showed efflux \npump activity (determined by flow cytometry, FC). Both cell lines \nhad a similar frequency of the F359I mutation (evaluated by DNA \nsequencing). However, Ki562 cells showed higher levels of BCR-\nABL than Ko562 cells (evaluated by qRT-PCR and WB, p<0,01). \nBoth of them, expressed similar levels of surface CD44 (evaluated \nby FC), which was downregulated by 4MU as well as by IM only \nin Ko562 cells (p<0.05). 4MU decreased the metabolic activity on \nboth cell lines (determined by XTT, p<0.01) without modifying the \npercentage of PI+ cells respect to untreated control (evaluated by \nFC). Moreover, the co-treatment with 4MU+IM inhibited metabolic \nactivity more than each drug alone in both cell lines (p<0.01), with -\nout modifying the percentage of PI+ cells. We conclude that Ki562 \ncells would be an interesting model to study IM resistance since the \noverexpression of BCR-ABL is one of the mechanisms related to \ntherapeutic failure in CML patients. The loss of CD44 modulation \nin Ki562 cells could also be involved in their resistance. In addition, \n4MU shows a cytostatic effect and enhances IM effect on metabolic MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

(100) CFTR OVEREXPRESSION MAY CONTRIBUTE TO \nCOLORECTAL CANCER\nAlejandra Palma, Mileni Soares Machado, Cecilia Lira, Fran -\ncisco Rosa, Fernanda Rubio, Gabriela Marino, Basilio Kot -\nsias, Monica Costas \nIDIM-CONICET\nCFTR mutations cause not only cystic fibrosis disease, but also in -\ncrease the risk of colorectal cancer. However, its probably role in \ncolorectal cancer from patients without cystic fibrosis has not been \npreviously investigated. RAC3 is a nuclear receptor coactivator usu -\nally overexpressed in several tumors, required to maintaining the \ncancer stemness. We investigated the functional relationship be -\ntween CFTR and RAC3 for maintaining cancer stemness in human \ncolorectal cancer.\nPreviously we investigated cancer stemness using a stable trans -\nfection of shCFTR or shRAC3 in HCT116 cells, and we found that \nCFTR downregulation inhibits the cancer stem phenotype. We also \nfound that CD133+ side population expresses higher levels of RAC3 \nand CFTR than CD133- and RAC3 overexpression increases CFTR \nexpression. \nTo further investigate this, we performed bioinformatics analysis in \nboth human colorectal cancer samples and Caco-2 cells. In order to \ndo these we used two datasets: 1) CD133+ or CD133- side popula -\ntions and 2) CFTRwt or CFTRmut cells. \nFirst we analyzed the expression levels of CFTR mRNA in colorectal \ncancer samples from patients without cystic fibrosis using the Xena \nplatform (TCGA). The CFTR mRNA without mutations was higher \nthan the CFTR mRNA with mutations and this correlates with an in -\ncreased expression of RAC3. Then we compared the gene expres -\nsion between CD133+ cells and CFTRwt cells using different plat -\nforms (ConsensusPathDB, STRING, Cytoscape, GeneMANIA). We \nfound a common gene expression pattern between them involved in \ninflammatory and nuclear receptor pathways that contribute to col -\norectal cancer development. \nFrom these and our previous results we conclude that although \nCFTR mutation may increase the risk of colorectal cancer, there are \nother pathways by which CFTR overexpression may also contribute \nto this disease, maintaining the cancer stemness and inducing tu -\nmor development.\n245.

Given the need for new therapeutic alternatives, in this work \nwe have studied the antitumor activity of two different natural com -\npounds in order to evaluate their potential use in clinical settings.\nNorcantharidin (NCTD) is a demethylated form of cantharidin, an \nactive component present in Mylabris beetles and levoglucose -\nnone (Levo) is obtained after the pyrolytic treatment of soybean \nhulls. NCTD showed an IC50 of 35 and 56 \u03bcM in 4T1 (murine) and \nHs578T (human) mammary cell lines respectively. Levo and struc -\nturally related derivatives (compounds 2, 3 and 4) were analyzed in \nLM3 (murine) and MCF 7 (human) cell lines showing an IC50 of 12 \nand 50 \u03bcM respectively.\nIn both natural compounds, anti-proliferative effects were associ -\nated with apoptosis induction. Nevertheless, NCTD also induced \na time-sustained reduction in ERK activated levels (p-ERK). More -\nover, in vitro, both compounds significantly reduced the adhesive \nand migratory capacities as well as secreted MMP-9 activity in a \ndose-dependent manner (p<0.05 Anova).\nAlthough these parameters could have a direct implication in malig -\nnant progression, in vivo assays pretreating 4T1 cells with NCTD, showed a significant increase in experimental metastatic spread. \nHowever, applying the same experimental approach, Levo and \ncompound 2 significantly reduced the number of LM3 lung nodules. \nFurthermore, systemic treatment of BALB/c mice induced a signifi -\ncant inhibition of tumor growth upon using compound 2 and a partial \neffect was obtained after employing Levo.\nIn sum, all the compounds analyzed show promising effects against \nbreast cancer and may become in the future an important thera -\npeutic alternative, either as a single drug or enhancing the effect of \npre-existing therapies.\n*L, Ariza Bare\u00f1o and D, Delbart, are both first authors\n246.

We have previously shown that human col -\norectal carcinoma cells lacking the FA-metabolizing enzyme alcohol \ndehydrogenase 5 (ADH5) cannot cope with blood concentrations \nof FA, which can be reverted by thiol-containing antioxidants like \nN-acetylcysteine (NAC) or glutathione monoethyl ester (GSH-MEE). \nThe rescue of FA toxicity by thiol-rich antioxidants might indicate that \nglutathione (GSH) participates in limiting the toxicity of FA. To ad -\ndress this hypothesis, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to inactivate the gene \ncoding for the regulatory unit (GCLM) of the enzyme \u03b3-glutamate -\ncysteine ligase (GCL), which conforms the GSH synthetic pathway, \nin HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells. The normalized viabil -\nities against 150uM FA were WT= 72.5\u00b17.4 \u00b5M; \u2206ADH5= 26.0\u00b15.1 \n\u00b5M and \u0394GCLM= 46.9\u00b17.1 \u00b5M (p=0.002, Tukey comparison vs WT; \nn=5, mean \u00b1 SEM). Moreover, the normalized plating efficiencies \n(PE) in presence of 25 \u00b5M FA were WT= 90.1\u00b16.3 %; \u2206ADH5= \n7.9\u00b12.7 % (P<0.0001) and \u0394GCLM= 72.4\u00b14.8 % (P=0.038), (n=5, \nmean \u00b1 SEM, Tukey?s comparison vs WT). To obtain mechanis -\ntic insights, we investigated in cell extracts the formation of S-hy -\ndroxymethyl-GSH (HSMGSH), which is the product of the reaction \nbetween FA and GSH, by ultraperformance liquid chromatography \ncoupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. \u2206ADH5 cells showed \na 1.85-fold increase in the ratio HSMGSH/GSH compared to WT \n(P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney test), indicating GSH reacts with endoge -\nnous FA forming HSMGSH in cells, and that ADH5 particiates in the \nmetabolization of HSMGSH. In conclusion, GSH might prevent FA \ntoxicity by forming HSMGSH, and thus limiting the reactivity of the \naldehyde. This role of GSH might have an impact for patients with \nthe human disease Fanconi Anemia and for carriers of mutations in \nthe tumor suppressor BRCA2, whose cells are more susceptible to \nFA damage.\n247.

It has powerful anticancer and antimetastatic effects against \nmalignant cell lines. In recent years, a great effort has been dedi -\ncated to the development of more effective and less toxic chemo -\ntherapeutic agents. In this sense, we evaluated the anticancer and \nantimetastatic activity on A549 cell line of silibinin and the complex \nVOsil, previously synthesized and characterized.  Likewise, the \nability of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to bind the compound was \nevaluated.ABSTRACTS119\nMethods:  The effect of silibinin and VOsil on the human lung can -\ncer cell line (A549) viability was measured (MTT assay). In addition, \nthe effect of the compounds at non-cytotoxic concentrations (5 \u00b5M) \non adhesion, migration and invasion was investigated. On the other \nhand, the interaction between both compounds and BSA was inves -\ntigated using tryptophan fluorescence quenching.\nResults:  VOsil behaved as a more cytotoxic agent than the ligand at \nconcentration 100 \u00b5M inhibiting 40 % of cell viability. The adhesion to \nfibronectin ability of cells treated with silibinin and VOsil decreased \n34 and 58 %, respectively in comparison with the control. The num -\nber of migrating cells decreased about 50 % after VOsil treatment. \nSilibinin attenuated cell migration to a lesser extent (25%). A 40% \nand 23% reduction on cell invasion was observed when cells were \ntreated with VOsil and silibinin, respectively. Usually, the oxidova -\nnadium(IV) cation was less effective in all assays. Binding constant \nvalues for the interaction of silibinin (9.88 \u00b1 0.95 x 106 L.mol-1) and \nVOsil (12.58 \u00b1 0.76 x106 L.mol-1) with BSA were determined, sug -\ngesting high affinity of the compounds toward the protein. Also, n \nvalues of 1.07 \u00b1 0.06 (silibinin) and 1.48 \u00b1 0.07 (VOsil) were ob -\ntained indicating an interaction with one binding site of BSA. \nConclusion : This study shows that the complexation enhances the \nbiological effects of the free flavolignan.\n248.

Epstein Barr virus (EBV) presence also influences cHL mi -\ncroenvironment composition and contributes to pathogenesis. Our \naim was to evaluate the PD1 / PDL1 pathway and EBV influence \non this pathway in pediatric cHL. Methods: 80 pediatric patients \nwere analyzed. EBV presence was assessed by in situ hybridization \n(HIS), the expression of PDL1 in the microenvironment (PDL1mic) \nand PDL1 in the HRS tumor cells (PDL1HRS) and PD1 in the micro -\nenvironment (PD1mic) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) expressing \nthe results as +cells/ mm2. PDL1 genetic alterations were analyzed \nin a subgroup of 37 pediatric patients by FISH, following the criteria \nof: genetic gain (PDL1 / CEP9 <3: 1), amplification (PDL1 / CEP9 \n\u22653: 1) or diplody (PDL1 / CEP9=1:1). The survival was evaluated in \nrelation to the expression of PDL1 mic, PDL1 HRS and PD1 mic. \nResults: No significant differences were observed in the PD1mic \ncount or in the PDL1 HRS count between the EBV + and EBV- cases \n(P> 0.05; Mann Whitney test). Unexpectedly, only 38% of pediatric \ncHL showed PDL1 genetic alterations by FISH (8% amplification, \n16% gain and 13% gain + amplification) and no differences were \nobserved in EBV + vs EBV- cases (p> 0.05, exact test of Fisher). \nIn the cHL EBV + cases, a significant increase in PDL1mic + cells  \nwas detected in the microenvironment (p> 0.05, Mann Whitney test). \nNeither PD1mic nor PDL1 expression in HRS cells or in the micro -\nenvironment was associated with survival in pediatric patients (p> \n0.05, log-rank test) .Conclusions: Although our group previously de -\nscribed an environment of high cytotoxicity in pediatric EBV + cHL, \nit could be counteracted by a PDL1 + cell niche in the microenviron -\nment, leading to unsuccessful elimination of EBV+ HRS tumor cells.\n249. (123) ANTIPROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY OF EXTRACTS \nFROM LIQUID CULTURE OF EDIBLE AGARICOMYCE -\nTES (BASIDIOMYCOTA) FUNGAL STRAINS ON HUMAN \nPROSTATE TUMOR CELLS\nFlorencia Abadia (UBA-FCEN-InMiBo-CONICET) , Bernardo \nLechner (UBA-FCEN-InMiBo-CONICET) , Nicol\u00e1s Anselmino (UBA-FCEN-CONICET-IQUIBICEN-QB-Laboratorio de Infla -\nmaci\u00f3n y C\u00e1ncer)\nFungi are eukaryotic organisms with absorbotrophic heterotrophic \nnutrition. They present growth with four phases: lag, exponential, \nstationary and senescent.The exponential phase presents a prima -\nry metabolism in charge of obtaining energy through nutrients and \ngetting biomass. In the stationary phase they synthesize secondary \nmetabolites (SM) that allow it to degrade the substrate and thus ex -\npand. Medicinal properties have been attributed for some of these \nSM. Studies on tumoral cells shown apoptosis induction, arrest of \nthe cell cycle and impaired proliferation by effect of edible strains of \nthe Agaricomycetes class. However, most of the studies were per -\nformed with the basidium and little is known about the effect of the \nextracellular medium (EM), where the SM are concentrated. In this \nstudy we aimed to evaluate the effect of the EM of different fungal \nstrains on the viability of human prostate tumor cell. PC3 cells were \ncultured with EM (20%; 24h) from six different strains of fungi collect -\ned at exponential or stationary phase (days 7 or 21, respectively). \nWe found that the EM of C. comatus, M. titans and G. lucidum, from \nday 21 significantly decreased (p <0.05) the viability of PC3 cells, \nevaluated by the MTS assay; whereas both EM (7 and 21) from C. \ncylindracea, impair viability of PC3 cells (p <0.05), with a significant \ndecrease in the number of cells (p <0.05). These effects correlate \nwith changes in cell-cycle where S phase grows at the expense of \nG1 phase. Nevertheless, no changes were observed in apoptosis \nlevels, analyzed by flow cytometry with ANXAV-FITC / IP staining. \nThese results indicate that EM of different strains of Agaricomycetes \naffect the viability of tumor cells, and this effect is not only dependent \nof the strain, but also on the growth phase.\n250. (127) THE ROLE OF AMPK-MEDIATED AUTOPHAGY IN \nCOLON CANCER AND ITS THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATION \nIN PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY WITH METHYL-AMINO -\nLEVULINATE\nPlacci Arditi M1, Ibarra LE1;2, Cogno IS1;2\n1. Departamento de Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Facultad de Cien -\ncias Exactas, F\u00edsico-Qu\u00edmicas y Naturales, Universidad Na -\ncional de R\u00edo Cuarto\n2. Instituto de Biotecnolog\u00eda Ambiental y Salud (INBIAS), \nUniversidad Nacional de R\u00edo Cuarto y CONICET\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer \ndeath. The increased resistance of CRC to conventional therapies \nled to the need to seek new treatments such as photodynamic ther -\napy (PDT). However, autophagy has been recently linked to the re -\nsistance of different antitumor treatments including PDT. Although \nautophagy is considered mainly as a cell survival mechanism, au -\ntophagy-mediated cell death has also been described evidencing \nthe dual role of this process whose effects on therapeutic resistance \nare not yet fully elucidated. The increase in adenosine monophos -\nphate (AMP) levels in cells will activate the AMP-dependent kinase \n(AMPK), who induce autophagy through the inhibition of the mTOR \ncomplex. Based on the above, we propose to characterize the mech -\nanisms that govern autophagy in CRC through the AMPK-induced \npathway and its implication in the therapeutic response to PDT. For \nthis, we used the GEPIA and Human Protein Atlas database to study \nthe relevance of AMPK and its correlation with the main modulators \nof autophagy in CRC. We also established two autophagy induc -\ntion systems using SW480 CCR cells. For the AMPK-dependent \npathway, cells were incubated in phosphate buffer saline (PBS 1X, \n15min - 2 h) and for the AMPK-independent pathway, Compound C \n(10-20 \u03bcM, 18 and 8 h) in growth medium was implemented. It was \nshown that the induction of autophagy, by both conditions, produces \na decrease in cell viability (MTT) in CRC cells (p value < 0.0001) \nover time where apoptosis is the main mechanism of cell death (de -\ntermined by an Annexin V/Propidium iodide assay 24 hours post-au -\ntophagy induction measured by flow cytometry). Lastly, it was shown \nthat cells with active autophagy (dependent and independent of \nAMPK) does not affect the cell viability (MTT) of CRC cells (p value \n= ns) treated with PDT (1.8 J/cm2; Me-ALA 0.5 mM); which suggests \nthat neoadjuvant treatments, which induce autophagy through these \npathways, could be beneficial for the success of PDT.

Instituto de Investigaciones M\u00e9dicas Alfredo Lanari, \nIDIM-CONICET \nTumor Microenvironment (TM) has altered its metabolism in a way \nthat favors tumor progression. TM metabolic differences can be \nfound even between different breast cancer (BC) subtypes. In the \nST000054 public database (Metabolic Workbench) we observed \nthat the mammary TM were enriched with cholesterol (1.9 times re -\nspected to reduction breast samples, p-value <0.01).\nOur goal is to understand how oncology relevant factors could al -\nter TM metabolism. In previous studies, we demonstrated that TNF \nincreased the triglyceride secretion and altered the pattern of fatty \nacid secretion. Therefore, we were interested in studying the regula -\ntion of lipid metabolism by an anti-inflammatory stimulus.\nWe observed by gas chromatography that the pattern of secreted \nfatty acids was altered in murine mammary gland adipose tissue \nconditioned media (C57BL-6j) after 48 h with or without dexameth -\nasone (Dx) 500 nM. Among them, the proportion of palmitic acid \nincreased (32.54% Dx vs 3.02% control). We also observed an en -\nrichment of saturated fatty acids under Dx stimulus similarly of what \nwe have seen with TNF (66.1% Dx, 30.3% TNF, 5.3% control).\nTo further understand this result, we analysed with GEO2R the gene \nexpression from GSE62635 database where adipocyte differentiat -\ned 3T3-L1 were treated with Dx 500 nM for 6 days and then we \nstudied pathways enrichment with the String platform. In the set of \ngenes with a fold change<-1.5 and an adj.p.value<0.01, we iden -\ntified the pathways described in KEGG as Unsaturated fatty acid \nbiosynthesis  (mmu01040, FDR=0.0014). Based on these data, we \nstudied in depth each gene involved in this pathway and observed \na correlation between the downregulation of the genes involved in \nthe pathway and the enrichment of saturated fatty acids found in the \nconditioned media.\nThese results encourage us to deepen our studies of the metabolic \nadaptation of cells in the tumor microenvironment to anti-inflamma -\ntory stimuli and how it can impact the metabolism of tumor cells.\n252.

Laboratorio de Biolog\u00eda del C\u00e1ncer, Instituto de investiga -\nciones Bioqu\u00edmicas de Bah\u00eda Blanca (INIBIBB-UNS-CONI -\nCET), Argentina\nCells express different classes of fibronectin (FN)-binding integrins, \nwhich induce signalling pathways that integrate Rho-GTPases to \nconvert integrin signals into specific effector functions. The aim of \nthis work is to study the relationship between differential expression \nof integrins and specific activation of Rho-GTPases in cancer. Using \ngenetically engineered cells, we observed that \u03b15\u03b21-integrins pro -\nmoted the formation of small adhesions and low RhoA activation, \nwhile \u03b1V\u03b23-expressing cells showed large adhesions, thick stress \nfibers and high RhoA activation. To further analyse these cellular \nphenotypes, we looked for specific RhoA activators (GEFs). For this \npurpose, we performed Mass Spectrometry analysis follow by bio -\nchemical assays and observed that GEF-H1 activation is \u03b1V\u03b23-in -\ntegrin dependent. \nBy bioinformatic analysis using a  mRNA dataset (Oncomine) we \nfound high GEF-H1 expression in human breast cancer compared \nwith non-tumoral breast tissue. In addition, high GEF-H1 expression \ncorrelated with a lower patient survival (n= 65, p=0.0071). We  also \nobserved by immunohistochemistry a significant GEF-H1 over-ex -\npression in human breast cancer biopsies compared with normal \ntissue (n=72, p=0.0201). Furthermore, GEF-H1 protein expression \nlevels correlate with the invasive potential of human and murine \nbreast cancer cell lines. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we gen -\nerated GEF-H1-knock out (KO) clones in a murine invasive breast \ncancer cell. We observed a significant decrease in the proliferation, migration and invasion rates in GEF-H1-KO cells (p<0.001) and a \ncorrelation with a decrease in focal adhesion formation and signal -\ning.\nThese results showed that GEF-H1-RhoA activation may mediate \nthe signaling involved in controlling cell structure, proliferation, mi -\ngration and invasion of breast cancer cells. In addition, the studies \nin human tumor samples suggest that GEF-H1 might be a potential \ntumoral biomarker.\n253.

Drug repositioning refers to new uses outside the scope \nof the original medical indications for existing drugs or compounds. \nMetformin (M) is an antidiabetic, propranolol (P) is a \u03b2-blocker, chlo -\nroquine (CQ) is used to treat malaria. We found that M+P combi -\nnation could be effective for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) \ntreatment. Our aim was to widen the knowledge of the mechanisms \nresponsible for the effects of M+P treatment and to study the effect \nof other repositioned drugs combinations on TNBC. We performed \nan in vitro  screening of drugs under reposition on TNBC cells and de -\ntermined that M+P and CQ+P were particularly efficient in reducing \nproliferation. They showed synergistic effect, affecting significantly \napoptosis. M+P reduced phospho Erk levels after serum induction \nbut did not affect the expression levels of the epithelial markers \n\u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin. In vivo  treatment with M(2g/l)+P(25mg/l) \nin 4T1 and M-406 models reduced tumor growth and metastasis \ndevelopment, while CQ+P did not show antitumor effect. Evalua -\ntion of the effect of M+P on immune cells revealed an increase in \nintratumor M-406 Tregs (P<0.05). 4T1 tumors showed an increase \non CD4+ (P<0.01), Treg (P<0.05) and a decrease in Th17 (P<0.01) \ncells. Moreover, we proved that M+P affects different steps asso -\nciated to 4T1 tumor dissemination and decreases the % of Ki67+ \ncells in lung metastases (P<0.05). We developed an adjuvant model \n(M+P treatment after tumor excision) and observed that M+P was \neffective preventing metastasis development (P<0.05). In brief: 1) \nM+P treatment decreased tumor and metastasis growth affecting \nseveral steps of tumor dissemination and it modified intratumor im -\nmune cells populations. 2) M+P treatment could be useful for adju -\nvant TNBC therapy avoiding the toxicity and high costs associated \nto conventional chemotherapies.\n254.

Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eda, Biolog\u00eda Molecular y Neurociencias, \nUBA-CONICET.\n2. Hospital Pirovano, Divisi\u00f3n Patolog\u00eda.\nAnal SCC is a rare malignancy, accounting for only 4% of all can -\ncers affecting the gastrointestinal tract. However, is one of the most \ncommon reported malignancy among men with HIV infection. ASCC \ntreatment is associated with severe disease and treatment-related \nmorbidity, therefore there is an urgent need to develop novel ther -\napeutic approaches. The exact pathogenesis of ASCC remains un -\nknown, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved \nhave been hampered by the lack of animal models. Here, we took \nadvantage of the driver line K14-CreERtam that we have previously \ncharacterized as a system that targets the basal layer of the squa -\nmous epithelia. Our aim was to characterize the expression of the ABSTRACTS121\ndriver system as well as the consequences of targeting activated \nras to the anal epithelium. We breed the driver line with Rosa26 \nreporter animal line and with K- ras knock in  mice. Tissues from \nthese mice were used to study the phenotype and characterized \nby immunohistochemistry (IHC). The administration of tamoxifen to \nreporter mice resulted in the expression of EGFP in epithelia cells \nof the anal mucosa. K14-CreERtam/K-rasG12D/+ mice exhibited an anal \nphenotype 3 weeks after induction in contrast with  a control group of \nK14-CreERtam (K14-CreERtam/K-rasG12D/+: 76 days (median survival). \nKaplan\u2013Meier survival curve, p<0,0001). Anal lesions  arising in K14-\nCreERtam/K-rasG12D/+ were diagnosed as low grade dysplasia with in -\ncreased cell proliferation restricted to the basal layer. IHC of the anal \nlesions showed an abnormal expression of cytokeratins 6 and 14 \n(differentiation markers) and an increase in pS6 (most downstream \ntarget of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway) expression in the upper \nlayers. We conclude that our driver system targets specifically the \nanal epithelium and the activation of K-ras is sufficient to produce \ndysplastic changes on it, showing an increase in pS6 expression. \nThese results warrant further analysis of the mechanism underlying \nthe development of ASCC.\n255.

Centro de Investigaciones Inmunol\u00f3gicas B\u00e1sicas y Apli -\ncadas (CINIBA), Facultad de Ciencias M\u00e9dicas, Universidad \nNacional de La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nRecent evidence has revealed that high-fat diet (HFD) plays a role \nin prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression. Our hy -\npothesis is that HFD alters miRNAs expression favoring prostate \ntumor growth. To assess this hypothesis, C57BL/6J male mice were \nchronically fed with HFD or control diet (CD). Murine TRAMP-C1 \nPCa cells were injected s.c on HFD and CD fed mice. After tumor \ngrowth, mice were sacrificed, tumors were collected and miRNAs \nisolated and analyzed by GeneChip\u00ae miRNA 4.0 Array (Affymetrix) \nmicroarrays. We identified 18 down- and 8 up-regulated miRNAs \n(FDR<0.05) in tumors from HFD fed mice compared to CD mice. We \nused DIANA-TarBase v7 of the miRPath tool to identify the miRNA \nvalidated target genes. Additionally, KEGG signaling pathways were \nidentified. Target genes for down-regulated miRNAs were involved in \ncancer-related and lipid metabolism pathways, while those derived \nfrom up-regulated miRNAs were more associated with processes \nrelated to metabolism of xenobiotics and chemical carcinogenesis. \nFrom these data miR-133a-3p and miR-133b emerged as potential \ntumor suppressor miRNAs. We evaluated the expression of hsa-\nmiR-133a-3p and 133b in PCa compared to normal adjacent tissue \n(NAT) using the bioinformatic UCSC Xena resource. We found that \nhsa-miR-133a-3p and 133b were significantly downregulated in PCa \ncompared to NAT and negatively correlated with gleason score. Ka -\nplan Meier curves indicated that lower levels of hsa-miR-133a-3p \nand 133b correlates with a worse progression free interval. Also, \nwe analyzed the expression of hsa-miR-133a-3p and 133b target \ngenes. We found that BUB1, CENPF, XPO1 and RAN expression \nwere significantly increased in PCa compared to NAT and positively \ncorrelated with gleason score. Also, high expression of these genes \nis associated with a worse progression free interval. In summary, \nHFD represses tumor suppressor miRNAs expression leading to an \nincrease in oncogenes expression and thereby impacting on PCa \ndevelopment. \n256.

Bue -nos Aires, Argentina.\nCancer stem cells (CSC) are resistant to chemo and radiotherapies. \nTo validate CSC as therapeutic targets in breast cancer, we ana -\nlyzed the effect of Lapatinib (Lp, HER2 inhibitor), ATRA or the com -\nbined treatments, on growth, cell cycle distribution and metastatic \ncapacity of primary mammospheres (CSC enriched cultures) from \nHER2 negative cell lines (4T1, MCF-7 and T47D).\nWe determined by WB that HER2 is overexpressed only in CSC \nsubpopulation of all cell lines analyzed. Primary mammospheres \nwere treated for 96 h with Lp1\u00b5M for 4T1; 5\u00b5M for MCF-7, 2\u00b5M for \nT47D cells combined or not with ATRA 1\u00b5M. ATRA treatment alone \nor combined with Lp only significantly reduced 4T1 mammospheres \ndiameters (p\u02c20.05 Anova test) and signs of cell death were also ob -\nserved. \nThe combined treatment induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase \nafter 48h of treatment in 4T1 mammospheres, analyzed by flow \ncytometry. However, this combination not significantly induces cell \ncycle arrest in MCF- 7 mammospheres. Finally, we performed an \nexperimental lung metastasis assay in mice pretreated with ATRA \nand Lp and observed that combination reduced metastatic potential \nof 4T1 cells derived from mammospheres (p\u02c20.05 Kruskal Wallis).\nIn the present work we have demonstrated that the CSC component \nof HER2 negative cell lines overexpress such receptor. Moreover, \nLp and ATRA combined treatment can successfully reduce mammo -\nspheres growth and metastatic potential in 4T1 experimental model. \n257. (141) BRAFI RESISTANCE INCREASES THE SENSITIVI -\nTY TO OXPHOS INHIBITORS OF MELANOMA CELLS \nArbe Mar\u00eda Florencia1, GC Glikin1, LME Finocchiaro1 and Vi -\nllaverde Marcela Solange1\n1 Unidad de Transferencia Gen\u00e9tica, \u00c1rea Investigaci\u00f3n, IO -\nHAR, UBA.\nNear 50% of melanoma cells harbor BRAFV600E as a driver muta -\ntion. BRAFV600E inhibitors (BRAFi) are approved therapy agents \nfor unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Despite their initial ef -\nficacy, BRAFi resistance is acquired at 6-8 months in 50% of pa -\ntients. Metabolic adaptations seem to be implicated in the emer -\ngence of BRAFi resistance. In this context, the aim of the present \nwork was to establish a BRAFi resistant melanoma cell line to in -\nvestigate the response to different metabolic modulators. A375 (a \nBRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell line) was significant affected \nby 1 \u00b5M GSK2118436 (Dabrafenib, BRAFi) showing a decrease \nin cell number. Despite this sensitivity, we were able to establish \nA375 resistant variant (A375-R) by increasing the concentration of \nGSK2118436 for four months. A375-R presented a significant in -\ncrease in GSK2118436 and PLX4032 (other BRAFi) IC50s both as \nmonolayers and spheroids culture. Then, we studied the effect of \n9 different metabolic modulators: 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG); oxamate; \n6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN); metformin (MET); antimycin A; dichlo -\nroacetic acid (DCA); methotrexate (MTX); BPTES and Everolimus \n(RAD001). A375 and A375-R presented similar response to 2-DG, \noxamate, DCA and BPTES. A375-R showed significant resistance to \nMTX and 6-AN compare to A375 (IC50s: >10 vs 0.73 \u00b5M, p< 0.001). \nInterestingly, A375-R showed a higher sensitivity to MET and anti -\nmycin A than A375 (IC50s: 2.35 vs 4.22, p<0.001 and 0.005 vs 0.022 \n\u00b5g/mL, p<0.001, respectively). In other words, acquired resistance \nto GSK2118436 favored OXPHOS inhibitors treatment such as MET \nand antimycin A. Despite this sensitivity, the combination of MET \nand GSK2118436 did not present synergistic effect when there were \nincubated simultaneously. However, sequential treatment with these \ndrugs at high concentrations showed a potentiating effect. Thus, \nfurther in vitro  and in vivo  combinatory treatments are required to \nidentify the potential benefit of this combinatory strategy. \n258.

The antitumor activity of \nHDAC inhibitors has been linked to their ability to induce gene ex -\npression through acetylation of histone and nonhistone proteins. An -\naplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy. \nRadiotherapy (RT) is one of the main modalities of treatment for \nATC. In most patients, surgical resection is not possible. Therefore, \nRT either as altered fractionation or in combination with chemother -\napy has an important role in achieving local control. Objectives:  \nThe objective was to study the radiosensitizing effect of valproic acid \nat different radiation doses in an anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line \n(8505c). Methods:  Cells were incubated with 1 mM VA and irradi -\nated with a source of gamma rays at different doses. Radiation re -\nsponse was analyzed by clonogenic assay. Cell cycle and cell death \nwere measured 24 and 48 h after irradiation at 2 and 5 Gy. DNA \ndamage was evaluated 30 min and 24 h after irradiation at 2 and 5 \nGy. Ku80 expression was assessed by Western Blot. Results:  A ra-\ndiosensitizing effect was observed with a reduction of survival frac -\ntion at 2 Gy from 0.28 to 0.20 in the treated cells (p<0.05). VA treat -\nment increased apoptotic cell death 24 and 48 h after irradiation at 5 \nGy (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively). Average \u03b3H2AX foci number \nwas increased at 30 min (p<0.01 for 2+VA and 5+VA Gy). Average \nfoci size was increased at 24 h at 2+VA Gy (p<0.01). AV enhanced \nthe frequency of foci larger than 1.0 \u00b5m2 in cells irradiated with 2 Gy \nat 24 h (p<0.01). Ku80 expression was reduced in the 2+AV group \nat 30 min compared to 2 Gy. Conclusion:  These results suggest \nthat VA pretreatment could have an important role in enhancing the \neffect of radiation in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. Particularly, the \nradiosensitizing effect could be mediated by a reduction in the DNA \ndamage repair capacity at low doses (2 Gy).\n259. (151) CRITICAL MOLECULAR MECHANISMS THAT MOD -\nIFY BONE MARROW-MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL BE -\nHAVIOUR IN ADVANCED BREAST CANCER PATIENTS\nBorzone FR1, Sanmartin MC2, Giorello MB1, Fern\u00e1ndez Va -\nllone VB3, Martinez LM4, Piccioni F1, Batagelj E5, Feldman L1, \nPacienza N2, Yannarelli G2, Chasseing NA1. \n1.

Departamento de Oncolog\u00eda, Hospital Militar Central.\nMost of untreated advanced breast cancer patients ( BCP , invasive \nductal, stage IIIB) develop osteolytic bone metastasis, due to the \nexistence of a pre-metastatic niche ( PMN ) that favours extravasa -\ntion, migration, and proliferation of tumor cells. We found that bone \nmarrow ( BM) mesenchymal stem cells ( MSC ) from BCP  have lower \ncloning, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation capacities than \nhealthy donors ( HD) MSC. A  conserved pool of functional MSC is \nessential for preventing the PMN formation.\nThus, our aim was to identify the molecular mechanisms responsi -\nble for the loss of function in MSC from BCP. For this purpose, we \nstudied the expression of stemness markers (OCT4, SOX2, hTERT, \nCD49b, CD146, telomere length), triggers osteogenic differentiation \n(RUNX2 and BMP2) [qPCR], and the cellular oxidative state (ROS \nlevels) [FACS] in MSC from enriched cultures of BM aspirates from \nBCP vs HD. We also evaluated the morphologic characteristics [Op -\ntical Microscopy], proliferation capacity [Proliferation Assay], and \ncell cycle profile of MSC [FACS]. Besides, we compared the pool of \nMSC in BM aspirates [RosetteSepTM].\nThe results indicated that BCP-MSC (n=7) vs HD-MSC (n=7) had: \nlower expression levels of OCT4 (p=0.026), SOX2 (p=0.008), hTERT (p= 0.004), CD146 (p=0.041) and higher levels of CD49b \n(p=0.028), RUNX2 (P=0.039) and BMP2 (P=0.033); shortened telo -\nmere length (p=0.002); increased ROS levels (p=0.036); decreased \nproliferative capacity (p=0.03); higher relative proportions of cells \nin G0/G1 phase (p=0.011) and lower in S phase (p=0.033); lower \nnumber of CFU-F (p=0.01); increased area (p=0.001), higher long \n(p=0.02) and short axis (p=0.001). In addition, BCP vs HD had a \npoor pool of BM MSC (p=0.006).\nIn conclusion, the lower expression of OCT4 and SOX2 in MSC, \nwould lead to an ineffective self-renewal, proliferation, and differ -\nentiation of these stem cells, providing insights about the molecular \nalterations in the BCP-MSC, key players in the development of the \nPMN.\n260. (156) P300 INVOLVEMENT IN APOPTOSIS AND ME -\nTASTASIS IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CARCINOMA \n(TNBC)\nGallardo GA1, Clemente V1, Ibarra A1, Facchinetti MM1, Curi -\nno AC1, Fermento ME1\n1Laboratorio de Biolog\u00eda del C\u00e1ncer, Instituto de Investigacio -\nnes Bioqu\u00edmicas de Bah\u00eda Blanca (INIBIBB), Universidad Na -\ncional del Sur (UNS)-Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones \nCient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Bah\u00eda Blanca, Argentina.\nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous group of \ntumors that lack specific molecular targets. Therefore, it is neces -\nsary to investigate potential tumor markers for this subtype of BC. \nThere are few studies in TNBC on the role of p300 in apoptosis \nand they are contradictory. Previously, we published that pharma -\ncological inhibition of p300 increases apoptosis in murine BC cells, \nhowever, it is necessary to check whether the same effect occurs in \nhuman TNBC cells. Recently a  prometastatic role of p300 in BC has  \nbeen found. In addition, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhi -\nbition of p300 decreases migration and adhesion in TNBC, showing \nthe need to delve into the molecules involved. Hence, the aim of this \nwork was to study the effect of the inhibition of the acetylase func -\ntion of p300 in the processes of apoptosis and metastasis in human \nTNBC cells. The MDA-MB-231 cell line was treated with VV59 (in -\nhibitor of the acetylase function of p300) or its vehicle (DMSO). In a \ncell viability assay, we observed that the pharmacological inhibition \nof p300 produced a decrease in the number of cells compared to \nvehicle (p<0.001). When we analyzed the cell cycle by flow cytome -\ntry, we detected an increase in the sub G0 phase and a decrease in \nthe G0/G1 phase in the cells treated with VV59 compared to those \ntreated with the vehicle (p\u02c20.001). We also observed an increase \nin apoptotic morphology in VV59-treated-cells compared to vehi -\ncle-treated cells by dapi staining (p\u02c20.001). On the other hand, by \nimmunofluorescence assay we detected that pharmacological inhi -\nbition of p300 induced an increase in the levels of E-cadherin and \n\u03b2-catenin in the membrane, and a decrease in the number of stress \nfibers compared with the control cells (p\u02c20.01). Taken together, these \nresults demonstrate an antitumor role for pharmacological inhibition \nof p300 acetylase function in TNBC.\n261.

Instituto de Investigacio -\nnes M\u00e9dicas Alfredo Lanari \u2013 IDIM-UBA/CONICET.\nCancer Stem Cells (CSC) are the responsible of colorectal cancer \n(CRC) persistence.  We have previously demonstrated that RAC3, a \ntranscription coactivator usually overexpressed in CRC is required \nfor maintaining CSC, with anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagy effect. \nMoreover,  Aloysia polystachya (AP) extracts induce the cell death of \nCRC, in vivo  and in vitro . Quercetin, an agonist of the AHR, was a \nflavonoid detected at high level as one of the AP components. \nIn this work, we investigated the effects of quercetin and the proba -\nble AHR/CSC/RAC3 relationship in CSC of CRC.  The effect of the ABSTRACTS123\nflavonoid  was investigated performing cytotoxicity assays in the \nhuman CRC HCT116wt cell line (overexpressing RAC3) or shR -\nNA-RAC3 stimulated with different concentrations of quercetin for \n24h. HEK293 cells (low levels of RAC3) were used as a non-tumoral \ncontrol. The quercetin pathways and AHR/CSC/RAC3 relationship \nwere investigated by bioinformatics studies using public repository \nmicroarrays data from the human CRC CaCo-2 cells, CD133+ or \nCD133\u2212 side populations, from rat CRC and from human CRC sam -\nples from TCGA, using Xena, ConsensusPathDB and STRING plat -\nforms. We found that quercetin induced a significant increased cyto -\ntoxicity of HCT116wt respect to shRNA-RAC3 HCT116 and HEK293 \n(p<0.05; Tukey test). High expression levels of AHR and RAC3 \nwere mainly associated to the CD133+ side population (p<0.01; \nTukey test). The AHR expression was associated to CD133+ and \nboth were significantly increased in CRC (598 samples) respect to \nnormal tissues (GTEX, 308 samples) (Welch\u00b4s t-test p=7.14e-20, \nand p=2.297e-26, respectively).  The overrepresentation analysis \nof genes induced by quercetin demonstrated that at least apopto -\nsis and autophagy pathways were significantly affected (p<0.01). \nTherefore, the increased sensitivity of CSC to cell death induced by \nquercetin could be a consequence of enhanced AHR expression, \nwhere perhaps RAC3 could be an AHR coactivator.\n262.

Homogeneous boron targeting \nto all tumor cell populations contributes to BNCT success. How -\never, tumor blood vessels are structurally abnormal, affecting the \ndistribution of the boron agent in the tumor. We demonstrated, in \nthe hamster cheek pouch oral cancer model, that thalidomide (Th) \ninduced a transient aberrant blood vessel normalization, improved \nboron distribution in tumor and BNCT therapeutic effect. However, \nTh is highly soluble in dimethilsulfoxide (DMSO) which negatively \naffects animal\u00b4s welfare. In this study we aimed at optimizing the \npreviously published Th protocol, increasing the animal\u00b4s welfare. \nMaterials & methods:  Cancerized hamsters were subjected to 2 \nintraperitoneal injections on 2 consecutive days of: (A) Th as pre -\nviously published: 112 mg/ml DMSO (n=3 animals); (B) 100 mg \nTh/250 \u00b5l DMSO+meloxicam (anti-inflammatory drug)+lidocaine (lo -\ncal anaesthesia) (n=4); (C) same as (B), no meloxicam, no lidocaine \n(n=3). Aberrant blood vessel normalization was assessed by a dou -\nble-blind macroscopic study in the precancerous tissue surrounding \ntumors. Animal clinical signs and tumor response were evaluated. \nResults:  All protocols exhibited transient blood vessel normalization \nin the precancerous pouch tissue. 1 out of 3 animals died in (A). The \nanimals exhibited pain, internal bleeding, intestinal inflammation \nand adherences. In (B), meloxicam reduced the intestinal inflam -\nmation and lidocaine reduced the pain due to Th injection vs (C) \n(p=0.0286). Ongoing studies (n=10) showed 10% mortality rate and \n84% of tumor reduction after (B). Conclusion:  We optimized the Th \nprotocol used for our BNCT studies in terms of the animal\u2019s welfare. \nIt induced blood vessel normalization in precancerous tissue and \nreduced tumor volume. This would improve boron distribution and \nbenefit BNCT therapeutic effect. Acknowledgments:  To Med. Vet. \nP. O\u00f1a; Dr. E. Kreimann; Lazar laboratory.263.

Instituto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental, CONICET.\n2. Academia Nacional de Medicina de Buenos Aires.\nIt has been hypothesized that FGF2 increases RUNX2 and RUNX2, \nin turn, increases FGF2 expression, maintaining a positive loop. We \nhave shown that T47D and IBH6 cells overexpressing RUNX2, ex -\npress high levels of FGFR2 and FGF2, supporting this hypothesis. \nHowever, RUNX2 tumors are resistant to FGFR inhibitor therapy \nshowing a more aggressive phenotype compared with control tu -\nmors. We are exploring the role of FGF2-FGFR-RUNX2 axis and its \nrelationship with hormone receptors in BrCa.\nThe aim of this work was to evaluate endocrine therapy in RUNX2 \noverexpressing tumors.\nT47D and IBH6 cells express ER, PR and FGFR1-4. RUNX2 and \ncontrol cells (C, empty vector) were injected into the flank of NSG \nmice. Animals were treated for 3 weeks with an antiestrogen (Ful -\nvestrant FUL, 0.5mg/week) or an antiprogestin (Mifepristone MFP, \n6mg pellets). Control tumors showed a significant growth inhibition \nwith the therapy (C-T47D p<0.0001 C vs FUL and MFP; C-IBH6 \np<0.0001 C vs FUL), a lower Ki67 index (C-T47D: p<0.0001 C vs \nFUL, p<0.05 C vs MFP,) and higher stromal remodeling compared \nwith untreated tumors. RUNX2-T47D and -IBH6 tumors were resis -\ntant to endocrine therapy and all animals bearing RUNX2-T47D tu -\nmors developed lung metastasis. RUNX2-IBH6 responses to MFP \nremains to be assessed. \nWe conclude that RUNX2 promotes BrCa progression and plays \na role in the acquisition of endocrine resistance. Further studies \nare required to elucidate the role of FGF2/FGFR2 in the establish -\nment of this phenotype. Our results emphasize the development of \nRUNX2 inhibitors to use in combination with standard therapy for \nBrCa treatment.\n264.

Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cni -\ncas (CONICET)\nIntroduction  Head and neck cancer patients are naturally depleted \nof Glutamine (GLN) and this deficit is accentuated by radiotherapy/\nradiochemotherapy side effects. Other authors previously demon -\nstrated that GLN significantly reduced mucositis in patients treated \nwith chemotherapy and/or radiation, accelerated the healing pro -\ncess in the hamster oral mucositis model and prevented DMBA-in -\nduced squamous cell cancer in the hamster cheek pouch. BNCT \ncombines preferential tumor uptake of 10B compounds and neutron \nirradiation, selectively destroying the tumor cells while preserving \nthe normal cells. Our group assessed different compounds as an ad -\njunct to BNCT to improve therapeutic efficacy and/or reduce toxicity \nin the hamster cheek pouch oral cancer model. The aim of the pres -\nent study was to evaluate the potential capacity of GLN to reduce \nBNCT-induced mucositis and/or enhance therapeutic efficacy in MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020124\nthis model.  Materials and methods  Tumor bearing hamster cheek \npouches were exposed to BNCT mediated by boronophenylalanine \n(BPA) at 2.6 Gy absorbed dose to precancerous tissue +/- GLN (joint \ntopical and oral administration; 1 g/kg body weight per day during \nfollow-up) at two different pH (pH 5 and pH 7). The animals were fol -\nlowed during 28 days after BNCT. Results and Conclusion  In this \npilot study GLN was not toxic for the animals. Although GLN did not \nreduce mucositis, we observed a tendency for both GLN protocols \nto improve BPA-BNCT tumor complete response (CR) (reaching sta -\ntistical significance for GLN-BNCT pH 7 at 7 days, Fisher\u2019s exact \ntest) with similar overall responses (OR) vs BPA-BNCT alone, at 7 \nand 14 days after BNCT. At 21 and 28 days post irradiation, this ten -\ndency was still exhibited by BNCT+GLN at pH 7, showing a higher \nCR (60%) vs BNCT alone (45%) and BNCT+GLN pH 5 (53%), with \nsimilar OR (90% and 80%) vs BNCT alone (93%). Future studies will \nassess if GLN increases BPA uptake in tumor and the role of the pH \nof the GLN solution in BNCT+GLN tumor response.\n265.

National Council of Scientific and Technical Research (CO -\nNICET).\nBoron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the radiation \nfrom the nuclear reaction 10B (n, \u03b1) 7Li and there is not much known \nabout direct or indirect effects of the therapy that contribute to tumor \ncell survival, for example, ROS production or the immune system \nresponse. The aim of this work was to study the contribution of NA -\nDPH oxidases (NOX) in the generation of ROS and the expression \nof galectin 1 in HT-29 colon carcinoma cells after the irradiation with \na neutron beam without (N) and with boron (BNCT). Metodology \nand results : HT-29 colon carcinoma cells incubated with 50 ppm of \nBPA (BNCT) or without BPA were irradiated with a neutron beam (3 \nand 8 Gy) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor. After 24 hours or 4 days, the \nsupernatants of the irradiated cells were collected and used as con -\nditioned medium for migration (wound) and cell proliferation (MTT) \nassays. Total RNA was extracted from the irradiated cells and the \nexpression of NOX 1 and 5 and galectin-1 was measured (PCR). \nResults:  Irradiation with 3 Gy of neutrons (3N) after 24 hours inhib -\nited the migration of non-irradiated cells while at 8 Gy (8N) migration \nwas induced. After 4 days, neutron irradiation at both doses induced \nmigration and pre-incubation with BPA reduced this effect (3 and 8 \nBNCT). BNCT treatment (8 Gy) induced proliferation after 24 hours \nwhile 4 days later there was no effect. We observed a decrease in \ngalectin-1 expression in the first 24 hours post-irradiation while after \n4 days the expression increased in 3 BNCT and 8N groups. The ex -\npression of NOX1 and NOX5 enzymes increased at both doses, with \nor without BPA. Conclusion:  Increasing the dose radiation will not \nnecessarily lead to a therapeutic improvement as it is demonstrated \nhere that pro or antitumor effects are achieved independently.\n266.

Nuclear Medicine School Foundation, 4 Universit\u00e9 Libre \nde Bruxelles.\nSeveral studies have shown the beneficial potential of iodine and \n6-iodolactone (IL-\u03b4) in different cancer pathologies. It was demon -\nstrated that molecular iodine (I2), but not iodide (I) and IL-\u03b4 exerts \nanti-neoplasic actions on diverse tissues. The anti-neoplasic effect of iodine may be due to the synthesis of intracellular iodolipids. The \nunderlying mechanism through which IL- \u03b4 inhibits tumor growth re -\nmains unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of \nIL-\u03b4 on tumor growth and angiogenesis in human colorectal cancer \nHT-29 xenograft. Methodology and results : HT-29 cells were in -\njected subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice and IL-\u03b4 was i.p. \ninjected daily at a dose of 15 \u03bcg. IL-\u03b4 treatments in HT-29 xenograft \nshowed time-dependent inhibition of tumor growth.  IL-\u03b4 induced \na significant decrease of PCNA (p<0.05) and an increase of p27 \nexpression after 18 days of treatment (p<0.05). To assess tumor \nmicrovessel densities we analyzed CD31 staining by immunohis -\ntochemistry. IL- \u03b4 treatment decreased microvessel density by 17 \n% and 30% (p<0.01) after 18 and 30 days respectively. We ana -\nlyzed VEGF and VEGF R2 mRNA and protein expression by real \ntime PCR and immunohistochemistry respectively. IL-\u03b4 decreased \nVEGF-R2 mRNA by 23 % (p<0.01) after 30 days of treatment and \nalso decreased the percentage of VEGF and VEGF-R2 stained cells \nby 73 and 70 % respectively after 30 days of treatment (p<0.01). \nReal time PCR revealed that IL-\u03b4 treatment increased VEGF-R1 \nand Ang-1 mRNA expression (p<0.01). Conclusion:  these results \ndemonstrated the anti-angiogenic effect of IL-\u03b4. The mechanism in -\nvolves a combination of VEGF and VEGF-R2 expression decrease \nwith Ang-1 increase that would contribute to mature vessels stabi -\nlization and maintenance while VEGF R1 increase would produce \nanti-proliferative effect on endothelial cells.\n267.

Instituto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental, Laboratorio \nde Inmunopatolog\u00eda, CONICET\nHormone supplementation with progestins has shown a higher in -\ncidence and aggressiveness of mammary tumors. In this work, we \nset out to address the effect of progesterone (Pg) and its synthetic \nanalogues on tumor progression. For this we used the 4T1 triple \nnegative breast cancer tumor model in BALB/c mice. The admin -\nistration of Pg, Medroxyprogesterone (MPA) and Norgestrel (Ng) \ndid not impact tumor growth kinetics. However, we observed an \nincrease in metastatic spread (p<0.05) that was not reversed by \nthe antiprogestin Mifepristone. FACS analysis of the tumor micro -\nenvironment revealed an increased frequency of Foxp3 + regulatory \nT cells (p <0.05) and CD8 T lymphocytes with dysfunctional PD-1 \n+ TIM3 + phenotype (p <0.05). In vitro tests showed that proges -\ntins favored the differentiation and expansion of Tregs independent \nof the nuclear Pg receptor (p <0.01). In vivo Tregs depletion us -\ning DEREG mice drastically suppressed lung metastasis formation \nand the prometastatic effect of Pg (p<0.01). In contrast, adoptive \ntransfer of Pg-educated Tregs to DEREG mice favored lung me -\ntastases (p<0.05). Mechanistically, we observed that progestins \ninduced RANKL expression in Tregs cells, which increased the in -\nvasiveness of 4T1 cells (p<0.05) and a RANKL-dependent epithe -\nlial-mesenchymal transition transcriptional program, with increased \nexpression of Snail and Vimentin and a decrease in E-cadherin and \nMaspin (p <0.05). Finally, treatment with a RANKL blocking antibody \ndecreased Pg-induced metastatic spread (p <0.01). These results \ndescribe an unknown mechanism by which Tregs cells stimulate \nmetastatic spread through RANKL, induced by progestins. Finally, \nwe also identified RANKL as a mediator of the metastatic cascade \nin breast cancer, which represents a novel therapeutic approach.\n268.

We previously demonstrated morphologic and \nmetabolic changes in adipocytes indirectly cocultured with breast \ncancer cells, suggesting a first step towards browning of adipose \ntissue, which is an important contribution to the hypermetabolic state \nof breast cancer. Thus, the aim of study was to obtain insight into \nthe effect of epithelial cell-beige adipocyte communication on tumor \nprogression. Here, we characterized components present in con -\nditioned media (CMs) from beige adipocytes (BA) or white adipo -\ncytes (WA) achieved upon differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, \nand evaluated the effects of BA- and WA-CMs on both adhesion \nand migration of tumor (LM3, 4T1 and MC4-L1) and non-tumor \n(NMuMG) mouse mammary epithelial cell lines. Additionally, we \nanalyzed the expression of ObR, CD44, vimentin, MMP-9, MCT1 \nand LDH on tumor and non-tumor mouse mammary epithelial cell \nlines incubated with BA-, WA-CMs or Ctrol-CMs (control). 3T3-L1 \npreadipocytes differentiated into beige adipocytes upon PPAR g ac-\ntivation (rosiglitazone), displaying characteristics that morphologi -\ncally resembled brown/beige adipocytes. Levels of UCP1, CIDEA, \nGLUT4, leptin, MCT4 and FABP4 were increased while adiponectin, \ncaveolin 1, and perilipin 1 levels were decreased in BA with respect \nto WA. Tumor cell lines revealed lower cell adhesion (p<0.01) and \nincreased cell migration (p<0.05) after incubation with BA- and WA-\nCMs vs Ctrol-CMs. ObR and MMP-9 protein levels in MC4-L1 cells \nwere significantly increased (p<0.05) after incubation with BA-CMs \nvs WA- and Ctrol-CMs. In addition, MC4-L1 and LM3 cells signifi -\ncantly increased their migration (p<0.05) in the presence of beige \nadipocytes. These results suggest that beige adipocytes secrete \nsoluble factors that regulate the behavior of both tumor and non-tu -\nmor mouse mammary epithelial cells, favoring tumor progression.\n269.

Recent studies shows \nthat AT associated with breast cancer suffer browning and contribute \nto tumor development. The factors and signaling pathways respon -\nsible for the browning process are unknown, as well as the role of \nthe adipose tissue browning could have on the tumor. We recently \ndemonstrated that human AT around kidney tumor (hRAT), showed \na differential protein expression profile respect to AT from normal \nkidney (hRAN). In this work, we study the browning process in AT \nin hARTh and hRNA, evaluating the white and brown AT markers \nexpression. The ATs were obtained from patients with tumor kidney \n(hRAT, n=21) and kidney donors (hRAN, n=20). The AT fragments \nwere lysed and total proteins were obtained and 1) UCP1, TBX1, \nPPAR\u0263, c/EBP\u03b1, PGC1\u03b1, adiponectin and leptin were quantified by \nwestern blot; and 2) UCP1, PGC1\u03b1 and HSP by immunohistochem -\nistry. In addition, we incubated hRNA fragments with conditioned \nmedia (CMs) from tumor and non-tumor human renal epithelial cell \nlines for 48h, the tissues were lyzed and UCP1, TBX1 and PGC1\u03b1 proteins were measured. Statistical differences among the groups \nwere evaluated by one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u00b4s post hoc  tests. We \nfound UCP1, TBX1, PPAR \u0263, c/EBP\u03b1, PGC1\u03b1 and leptin significantly \nincreased in hRAT vs. hRAN explants (p<0.05). In addition, perilipin \n(mature adipocyte marker) was significantly decreased in hRAT vs. \nhRAN (p<0.05). Furthermore, UCP1, TBX1 and PGC1\u03b1 expression \nwere significantly increased in the hRAN incubated with tumor cells-\nCMs vs. hRAN incubated with non tumor cells-CMs (p<0.05). This \nwould indicate that the renal tumor cells secrete soluble factors stim -\nulating the surrounding adipose tissue browning. The AT browning \ncould fulfill a regulatory function on the tumor. \n270. (213) BRACHYURY (BRACHY) AND INSULIN LIKE \nGROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR I (IGF1R) EXPRESSION \nIN THYROID NODULAR PATHOLOGY\nMartin A, Fernandez MC, Masnata ME, Medin M, Papendieck \nP, Cl\u00e9ment F, Barrios E, De Matteo E, Chiesa A, Pennisi P.\nCentro de Investigaciones Endocrinol\u00f3gicas Dr. C\u00e9sar Ber -\ngad\u00e1 (CEDIE) CONICET- FEI - Divisi\u00f3n de Endocrinolog\u00eda, \nHospital de Ni\u00f1os Ricardo Guti\u00e9rrez; IMIPP, CONICET, Hos -\npital de Ni\u00f1os Ricardo Guti\u00e9rrez.\nIn pediatrics, thyroid tumor stratification is difficult to assess. Ep -\nithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), plays a role in tumor de -\nvelopment. In human carcinomas Brachy has been identified as a \nregulator of EMT associated to malignancy. To date, no information \nabout Brachy and IGF1R expression in pediatric thyroid nodular \ndisease is available. Aim: To evaluate Brachy and IGF1R expres -\nsion in thyroid nodular samples from pediatric patients and to study \nthe effect of Brachy overexpression in a thyroid papillary carcinoma \n(TPC) cell line in vitro. Methods : Paraffin-embedded samples from \npediatric patients with Thyroid Papillary Carcinomas (TPCa), Follic -\nular Adenomas (FA) or Benign Thyroid Nodular disease (BTN) were \nprocessed for Brachy and IGF1R immunostaining. TPC cells were \nused to obtain clones overexpressing Brachy (TPC. 50 and TPC. \n150). Gene expression was quantified by rqPCR. Proliferation as -\nsays (6 days) and wounding assays (24h) were carried out. Protein \nextracts were obtained from whole lysates and processed by west -\nern blot (WB). Results : 43 samples were analysed, 10 from BTN. \nOnly TPCa and FA showed positive staining for Brachy (16/25TP -\nCa;5/8FA) and IGF1R (12/25TPCa;3/8FA). In carcinomas, positivi -\nty for IGF1R was only detected when Brachy was present. Brachy \noverexpression in TPCcells (TPC50) increased proliferation com -\npared to parental cells (**p< 0.005). Cell migration was also higher \nfor Brachy overexpressing cells (**p< 0.005 TPC50 vs TPC), e-cad -\nherin expression was diminished, and mesenchymal markers (vi -\nmentin-fibronectin) were increased. Finally, WB studies showed that \nBrachy overexpression was related to a higher IGF1R expression in \nTPC50 cells in comparison to parental cells. Conclusion: Brachy \nexpression was associated to IGF1R expression in thyroid carci -\nnomas. In vitro, Brachy overexpression had an impact on IGF1R \nexpression, increased proliferation and migration. These results \nsuggest a potential role for Brachy in the biology of thyroid tumors.\n271. (216) UNDERSTANDING THE REGULATORY CONTEXT \nOF FGFR3 ALTERED BLADDER TUMORS, KEY TRAN -\nSCRIPTION FACTORS AS NEW POSSIBLE THERAPEU -\nTIC TARGETS\nZambrano M1, Sciacca M1,2, Moreno-Vega AI3, Langle YV1, \nBernard-Pierrot I3, Eij\u00e1n AM1,2, Lodillinsky C1,2.\n1Universidad de Buenos Aires, Facultad de Medicina, Institu -\nto de Oncolog\u00eda \u00c1ngel H Roffo, \u00c1rea de investigaci\u00f3n.

Paris, Francia.\nCurrently bioinformatic studies aim to understand the underlying \nmechanisms in bladder cancer (BC). FGFR3 is the most common \nalteration in BC, its oncogenic potential has been demonstrated and \ntarget therapies have been developed. However, like other target \ntherapies it is expected that patients develop resistance. The iden -\ntification of additional therapeutic options to use concomitant or se -MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020126\nquentially with these ones could help in this matter. In this context, \nour objective is to identify transcription factors (TFs) that could be \nnew potential targets in FGFR3-altered (FGFR3*) bladder tumors. \nUsing a BC gene regulatory network, publicly available data and  \nour transcriptomic data we obtained the activation profile of the TFs \nactivated in an FGFR3* context, we identified FOXM1 and p63 as \nessential and highly active TFs. We generated a p63 target gene \nsignature from MGHU3 cells by ChIP-seq integrated with the siTP63 \nRNA-seq expression profiling. Consistently with our previous ex -\nperimental results, gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed \nthat p63 positively mediates cellular processes such as migration, \ninvasion, proliferation, and represses cell death. We demonstrated \nthat altered FGFR3 regulates p63 at mRNA and protein level by \nusing a panFGFR inhibitor (PD173075) in human FGFR3* BC cell \nlines. Analysis of mRNA levels in human bladder tumors showed \na correlation between FGFR3 and TP63 expression in both Non \nmuscle invasive BC (r=0.57,p=6.59e-10) and muscle invasive BC \n(r=0.50,p=1.34e-07) FGFR3*. We also probed that inhibition of \nFGFR3 blunted the carcinogenic program carried out by p63 dimin -\nishing migration and proliferation at equivalent levels than specific \nsilencing of p63 in BC cells. In summary, we identified p63 a new \npossible target in FGFR3* BC, where we demonstrated the FGFR3 \nregulation over the protumoral TF p63. Additionally, we validated the \ngene regulatory network through experiments and reinforced our \nprevious results with bioinformatics.\n272. (217) EFFECT OF YERBA MATE IN A MOUSE MODEL OF \nCOLORECTAL CARCINOGENESIS\nGarcia-Lazaro RS1, Caligiuri LG1, Lorenzo N1, Lamdan H1, \nScursoni AM2, Alonso DF1 and Farina HG1. \n1 Centro de Oncolog\u00eda Molecular y Traslacional, Universidad \nNacional de Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n2 Servicio de Patolog\u00eda, Hospital Iriarte de Quilmes, Buenos \nAires, Argentina.\nColorectal carcinogenesis (CRc) is a process that stems from genet -\nic mutations induced by physical or chemical agents. Epidemiolog -\nical studies suggest that the consumption of some phytochemicals \nof the diet could directly affect the development of the disease. His -\ntorically, there have been mixed positions in what concerns yerba \nmate\u2019s pro or anti carcinogenic role. In 1991, the IARC classified \nhot mate as a probable carcinogenic beverage. In 2016, IARC again \nevaluated the carcinogenicity of mate under the hypothesis \u201cIt is \nthe temperature of the water and not the plant that is associated \nwith cancer\u201d. Due to insufficient evidence, cold mate could not be \nclassified. There are no studies that evaluate the relation between \nconsumption of cold mate and the carcinogenesis process. The aim \nof our research was to evaluate whether the consumption of cold \nmate modulated CRc.\nTo establish the model, we used 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine (DMH). \nCold beverages of yerba mate extract (YMe) in a dose of 1.6 gr/kg/\nday and Maltodextrin (MD - excipient of extract), were administered \nvia the drinking water. Male and female BALB/c mice were inject -\ned with DMH (20 mg/kg/week) subcutaneously once a week for 14 \nweeks. Fourteen weeks after the last DMH injection, the animals \nwere sacrificed. After extracting the colons, polypoid lesions were \ncounted. Then, colon\u00b4s mice were examined histologically. There \nwas a correlation between macroscopic and histologic results. In \nfemale mice we observed that 25% of the control group (MD + DMH) \ndeveloped tubulovillous adenomas while, in the treated group (YM \n+ DMH) all animals presented normal mucosa. In male mice, 37.5% \nof the MD + DMH group and 42% of the YM + DMH group showed \nadenomas. It is the first study that reports, on the one hand, that \ncold mate is not a carcinogenic beverage and on the other hand that \nchronic consumption of YMe would have a preventive role in CRc in \nfemale mice. Further studies are needed to understand sex-related \ndifference. \n273. (219)  YERBA MATE ( Ilex paraguariensis ) INDUCES \nAPOPTOSIS IN MURINE COLON CANCER MODELS; THE \nINTRINSIC PATHWAY AS A POSSIBLE MECHANISM\nGarcia-Lazaro RS1, Lorenzo N1, Caligiuri LG1, Lamdan H1, \nBerengeno AL2, Ortega HH2, Alonso DF1 and Farina HG1. 1 Centro de Oncolog\u00eda Molecular y Traslacional, Universidad \nNacional de Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n2 Centro de Medicina Comparada, Instituto de Ciencias Ve -\nterinarias del Litoral, Universidad Nacional del Litoral / CO -\nNICET\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the so-called westernized diseas -\nes and is the third most common cancer in both men and women. \nIn a previous work, we reported that yerba mate extract (YMe) from \nIlex paraguariensis,  a native South American tree which has a large \namount of bioactive compounds, inhibits CT26 cell proliferation by \ninduction of apoptosis. The aim of this research was to determine \nthe mechanism by which apoptosis is induced by YMe. To this end, \nin vitro  and in vivo  experimentation was carried out using CRC mod -\nels.\nThe mechanism of cellular apoptosis has an initiation and an execu -\ntion phase. The initiation phase has two possible origins: the extrin -\nsic or intrinsic pathway. It is reported that a key point in the intrinsic \npathway of cellular apoptosis are mitochondrial permeabilization \nprocesses, which are regulated by members of the Bcl-2 protein \nfamily. In vitro , we investigated the expression of the Bcl-2 protein \nusing CT26 cells. Western blot analysis showed that the level of \nanti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased in YMe treated cells. Im -\nmunofluorescence analyses also revealed a similar result. In vivo , \nusing a murine syngeneic tumor model, we showed that oral ad -\nministration of YMe significantly inhibited tumor growth. The tumor \ngrowth rate is the result of the balance between the proliferation and \nthe induction to apoptosis of the neoplastic cells. Therefore, to deter -\nmine whether this reduction in tumor growth was due to an increase \nin cell apoptosis, a TUNEL assay on the tumor section was per -\nformed. In agreement with what was observed in vitro , the TUNEL \nassay demonstrated that consumption of YMe increased apoptosis \nin cells in tumor tissues. In vitro  and in vivo  results suggest that YMe \ninduces apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway; however, further studies \nare needed to confirm this assumption.\n274.

C\u00e1tedra de Fisiopatolog\u00eda, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00ed -\nmica, Universidad de Buenos Aires; Buenos Aires, Argentina.  \nRecent findings show that high MRP4 levels are critical for pancre -\natic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell proliferation and associat -\ned with a more aggressive phenotype. We have de monstrated  the \npresence of MRP4 in the nucleus in pancreatic h uman PDACs  tis-\nsues. Also, we have observed this MRP 4 novel localization in both \nhepatic and pancreatic cancer cell lines, using techniques such as \nwestern blot prior to subcellular fractionation and confocal microsco -\npy. The  aim of the present work is to make a computational analysis \nto study possible sequences to be targeted with CRISPR-Cas 9 to \nstudy the mechanism underlying this novel localization. Our analysis \nof the complete protein sequence, consisting in 1325 amino acids, \nusing cNLS Mapper SOFTWARE found  a nuclear localization se -\nquence (NLS)  located from I33 to D42 (IGHKRRLEED) with a score \nof 7 that corresponds to proteins partially located in the nucleus. \nBibliographic recopilation  describes post-translational modifications, \nas phosphorylations , near NLS regions that could regulate the pos -\nsibility of interaction between NLS and the proteins involved in the \ntransporting. The analysis of the sequence described that the Y45 \nis a phosphorylation site linked evolutively with a conserved site of \nubiquitination located in K1278, closely to the previously described \nPDZ domain (ETAL1325). It is known that this domain is decisive for its \nlocation in the plasma membrane due to its interaction with adapter \nproteins such as NHERF1, NHERF3 or MPP1. In conclusion, we \npropose to explore the effect of three different  CRISPR cas9 con -\nstructions on  the transport of MRP4 to the nucleus. The first one ABSTRACTS127\nwill be focused on producing changes in the NLS sequence without \nchanging the reading frame and the other two to modify punctually \nY45 near NLS and the K1278 near PDZ domain.\n275.

RD are compounds \noriginally formulated for other indications that showed antitumor po -\ntential. Previously, we inoculated the triple negative (TN) mammary \ntumor M-406 in syngeneic CBi mice and studied, separately, the ef -\nfect of four combined MCT schemes administered in the drinking \nwater: A) Cyclophosphamide (Cy)30 mg/kg/d + celecoxib 30 mg/\nkg/d, B) Cy 20 mg/kg/d + metformin (M) 400 mg/kg/d  C) M 400 mg/\nkg/d + propranolol 7 mg/kg/d, D) Cy 25mg/kg/d + losartan 150 mg/\nkg/d. Our aim was to compare the results of MCT therapeutic effect \nfor all the drugs combinations, in order to identify the most effec -\ntive treatment. The % of reduction of tumor volume respect to the \ncontrol group without treatment [median (range),  A:77.9(50.9-89.9), \nB:82.3(59.9-93.4), C:61.4(31.9-70.8), D:94.9(80.5-99.8)] differed \nsignificantly among treatments (nonparametric ANOVA P<0.001); \nC <B and < D (Dunn\u2019s test P<0.05 and P<0.001 respectively). The \n% of reduction of the total lung metastatic volume [ A:98.8 (97.1-\n99.2) B:72.9 (50.6-100), C:60.0 (16.5-88.2, D:76.5 (76.5-100)] \ndiffered among treatments (P<0.05), A >C (P<0.05). Besides, the \ndifference in the % of increase of survival [ A:56.5 (-4.3-56.5) B:66.7 \n(50.0-66.7), C:41.7 (12.5-58.3), D:77.8 (17.3-149.7)] was significant \n(P<0.05), B <D (P<0.05). The four treatments did not cause weight \nloss and showed normal toxicity related signs. As a result, B and D \nshowed the bests antitumor effects, the antimetastatic effect was \nsimilar for A, B and D. Moreover, D produced the higher effect on \nincreasing survival. We conclude that cyclophosphamide + losartan \nwas the most effective of the four schemes. The other advantages \nof this drug combination as lack of toxicity, oral administration and \nlow cost, favors its quick translation to the clinic for the treatment of \nthe TN mammary cancer, an aggressive subtype with scarce ther -\napeutic options.  \n276.

Here, we addressed whether the rate limiting \nenzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, HMGCR, was associated with \nstem cell phenotypes. First, we analyzed HMGCR expression by \nRT-qPCR in the pluripotent stem cells lines WA-09 and FN2.1, in \nseveral CSCs lines derived from glioblastomas and in a breast can -\ncer (BC) stem-like state with HMGCR overexpression, generated in \nour lab (MCF-7/CR). With the exception of two of the glioma CSCs, \nthe rest of the cell lines showed increased levels of HMGCR when \ncompared to MCF-7 BC cell line. To further determine the role of \nHMGCR in the generation of stem states in BC, we infected MCF-\n7 cells with lentiviral vectors expressing the Yamanaka reprogram -\nming factors and obtained four clones, termed MCF-7/Rep clones #3, #5, #6 and #9. We analyzed the expression of the pluripotency \nfactors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog by qRT-PCR, using an iPSCs cell line \n(FAD) as a positive control. All MCF-7/Rep cells showed increased \nlevels of Sox2, up to 10-fold (MCF-7/Rep clone #3) when compared \nto MCF-7 parental cells. Oct4 was increased up to 10-fold in MCF-\n7/Rep #9 cells to levels comparable to those observed in FAD  iPS \ncells. Immunofluorescent detection of Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog in \ntwo clones (MCF-7/Rep #3 and #9) corroborated the observations \nfound at the transcriptional level. There was no expression of the \npluripotency surface markers SSEA-4, TRA-1-60 and the alkaline \nphosphatase assay was negative. Interestingly, HMGCR expres -\nsion in the MCF-7/Rep cells was decreased when compared to \ntheir parental counterpart. These results suggest that the MCF-7/\nRep clones may be intermediate states between a cancer cell and \na bona fide  pluripotent cell, and that, while HMGCR expression is \nunstable during reprogramming, is associated with well-established \nstem cells phenotypes in transformed and non-transformed cells.\n277.

The aim of the \npresent study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and radio -\ntoxic effects of (BPA+GB-10)-BNCT alone or combined with Oli -\ngo-Fucoidan or Glutamine. Materials and methods  BDIX rats were \ninjected subcutaneously in the right hind flank with DHD/K12/TRb \nsyngeneic colon cancer cells. Three weeks later, the tumor-bearing \nlegs were treated locally with (BPA+GB-10)-BNCT (Comb-BNCT) at \nthe RA-3 Nuclear Reactor.

Using the end-point \n\u201cincidence of tumors that underwent a reduction to \u00a3 50% of initial \ntumor volume\u201d to further assess therapeutic response, results were \n57% for Comb-BNCT alone, 80% for Comb-BNCT + GLN and 100% \nfor Comb-BNCT + O-Fuco. The incidence of severe dermatitis at two \nweeks (when the peak occurs) was 100% for Comb-BNCT alone, \nwhile O-Fuco reduced incidence to 80 % and GLN reduced inci -\ndence to 40%, the latter reduction being statistically significant vs. \nComb-BNCT alone (p<0.05).\n(BPA + GB-10)-BNCT is therapeutically effective. Oligo-fucoidan \nand GLN used as adjuvants would improve therapeutic efficacy and \nreduce radiotoxicity.\n278.

For ex -\nample, day 63 (mean \u00b1 SEM in mm2): control tumors: 46,5 \u00b1 9,70, \nn=8; paclitaxel:  32.4 \u00b1 6,40, n=7, p<0.05; salbutamol 29.3 \u00b1 7.58, \nn=7, p<0.05. Paclitaxel + salbutamol 9.33 \u00b1 2.45, n=9, p<0.0001 \nagainst control, p<0.05 against each individually. The coefficient of \ndrug interaction indicated synergism since the value obtained is < 1 \n(0.010, p<0.0005 in interaction by two-way ANOVA).\nIn order to assess the mechanism of action, several in vitro exper -\niments were performed. Paclitaxel diminished cell viability (trypan \nblue essay), while salbutamol diminished pERK/ERK ratio (using \nWB) and the expression of cyclin D1 gene (RT-qPCR). Moreover, \nboth drugs enhanced apoptosis (acridine orange ethidium bromide \nstaining assay). In preliminary results, salbutamol completely re -\nversed the increase of MDR1 (ABCB1) expression induced by pacli -\ntaxel. This could account for the synergic effect of both drugs. These \nresults suggest that the doses of chemotherapeutic drugs adminis -\ntered to patients in some triple negative (claudin-low) tumors could \nbe reduced in the presence of salbutamol, diminishing their toxicity.\n279.

Besides triggering cytostatic mechanisms in malignant \ncells, AVPR2 stimulation in microvascular tissue favors the release \nof VWF, a multifunctional protein involved in hemostasis and differ -\nent aspects of tumor biology. Our aim was to explore the potential \nimplications of VWF in the antitumor activity of [V4Q5]dDAVP using \nbreast and colorectal cancer models. First, in vivo  hemostatic activ -\nity of [V4Q5]dDAVP was assessed in New Zealand rabbits, in which \nadministration of clinically relevant single doses of the compound \n(0.3-5.0 \u00b5g/kg i.v.) was associated to a 45% reduction in aPTT clot -\nting times and a 20-70% increase in VWF:Ag and tPA plasma levels \n(p<0.05). Breast (MCF7, MDAMB231) and colorectal (COLO205, \nCT26) AVPR2-expressing cancer cell lines were used for in vitro  and \nin vivo  assays. All tested cell lines showed similar in vitro  sensitivity to [V4Q5]dDAVP (IC50 about 1 \u00b5M) as assessed by colony formation \nassays. However, using different syngeneic and xenogenic mouse \ntumor models, sustained [V4Q5]dDAVP treatment (0.3 \u00b5g/kg i.v. \nthrice-weekly) had highly variable and model-dependent effects on \nprimary tumor progression (70, 25 and 0% tumor growth rate reduc -\ntion for MDAMB231, COLO205 and CT26, respectively; p<0.05). To \nevaluate whether differential tumor response to [V4Q5]dDAVP could \nalso depend on the activity of vasculature-derived VWF, 72-h cell \ngrowth assays were conducted using pharmacologically achievable \nconcentrations of VWF (2 UI/ml). Sensitivity of tumor cells to VWF \nwere found as MCF7>MDAMB231>COLO205>CT26, correlating \nwith in vivo  results and with tumor cell expression of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, \na VWF receptor. In conclusion, response to [V4Q5]dDAVP therapy \nby primary tumor may depend on direct AVPR2-mediated cytostatic \neffects as well as on the sensitivity of cancer cells to VWF released \nfrom the vascular milieu.\n280. (287) MODULATION OF PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY EF -\nFECT BY STROMAL HIF-1\nFerrara MG1, Ibarra LE1, Lamberti MJ1, Rumie Vittar NB1.\n1. Instituto de Biotecnolog\u00eda ambiental y Salud (CONICET), \nUniversidad Nacional de R\u00edo Cuarto. \nTumor microenvironment (TME) is a unique interactive ecosystem, \nwhere fibroblasts represent the most abundant stromal population \nthat supports tumor growth. Due to aberrant and disorganized tumor \nproliferation, another common feature of TME is hypoxic regions de -\nvelopment, in which HIF-1 acts as the main molecular mediator of \nadaptability. We have previously shown that photodynamic therapy \n(PDT), an antitumor therapy based on the combination of light, oxy -\ngen and a photosensitizer (PS), promoted HIF-1 activation on tumor \ncells. Concomitantly, we also demonstrated a direct association of \ntumoral HIF-1 and therapeutic resistance to PDT.\nHowever, it is unknown whether this transcription factor modulates \nsurrounding stroma response to photo-intervention. In this study, we \ninvestigated the contribution of stromal in PS generation and its in -\nvolvement on photo-cytotoxicity. \nTME was mimicked using homotypic spheroids of fibroblast (MRC-5 \nwild type or shHIF-1) or colorectal cancer cells (SW480 shHIF-1), \nand heterotypic spheroids composed by 1:1 mixed fibroblast/tumor \ncells. Stromal HIF-1 status was sensed through a reporter gene con -\nstruct. The production of PS: Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) was quanti -\nfied by fluorescence microscopy. Cell viability was analyzed through \nMTT assay. \nOur findings determined that HIF-1 silencing conferred resistance \nto PDT in stroma 3D monoculture, without modifying generation of \nPpIX. On the other hand, in heterotypic spheroids, the profile of PpIX \nproduction was associated to the hypoxic-preferential distribution of \nthe stroma. Surprisingly, whereas stromal HIF-1 status did not im -\npact on therapeutic resistance, the cross-talk between fibroblasts \nand cancer cells improved the effect of PDT. \nOverall, these results suggest that response to PDT differs across \nhypoxic populations within TME. \nAs a consequence, the overall effectiveness of PDT is not defined \nonly by tumor sensitivity, there by stroma behavior should also be \nconsidered to certainly predict therapeutic outcome.\n281.

Classically, the Stx2\u00b4s cytotoxic effect is medi -ABSTRACTS129\nated by its receptor globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Furthermore, it \nhas been observed that malignant cells represent a great source of \nGb3. One of these Gb3-producing malignant tumors is breast can -\ncer, which is the most common cancer type in women worldwide. \nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive and \ndifficult to treat from all breast tumors. Our goal is to determine the \nantineoplastic effect of Stx2 in the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. The \nnon-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line NMuMG, which lacks \nGb3 (negative control), and VERO cells (positive control) were used. \nGb3 expression was immunolocalized in MDA-MB-231 and VERO \ncells, and Stx2 uptake was also observed in both cell lines, with \nhigher levels in VERO cells (p<0.0001). Besides, Gb3 levels were \nincreased after Stx2 treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells (p<0.007). MTT \nresults showed that 1 and 10 ng/ml Stx2 reduced cell viability af -\nter 12, 18, 24 and 48h (p<0.05). A Stx2 dose-dependent cytotoxic \neffect was found in MDA-MB-231 cells after 48h (p<0.05). This ac -\ntion was accompanied by an increase of karyorrhexis (p<0.0001) \nand a reduction of mitosis only in MDA-MB-231 and in VERO cells \n(p<0.0004), analyzed by immunofluorescence. With the purpose of \nevaluating whether an anti-Gb3 antibody would be able to trigger \na cellular response, 10 ng/ml of anti-Gb3 or combined with Stx2 \nwas assayed. A cytotoxic effect of anti-Gb3 was observed by MTT \nin MDA-MB-231, but with less potency than that produced by Stx2 \nitself (p<0.05) and no synergism was found between them. These \nresults suggest that MDA-MB-231 cells are susceptible-dose depen -\ndent to Stx2 and sensitive to anti-Gb3 antibodies. Further studies \nare necessary to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Stx2 or \nanti-Gb3 as a potential treatment in TNBC.\n282.

Despite \nnovel target therapies and immunotherapies improve overall survi -\nval rates, only a part of ME patients benefits from this therapies and \nothers develops drug resistance, making crucial the study of new \ncompounds for ME treatment.\nBexarotene (Bex), an RXR agonist used for cutaneous T cell lym -\nphoma treatment, is currently being studied as alternative therapy \nfor other types of cancer. The first aim of this work was to evaluate \nBex effect on A375 and WM35 human melanoma cell lines  in vitro . \nWe found that Bex significantly decreases cell viability after 48h of \nboth ME cell lines in a dose dependent manner (p<0.05). On the \nother side, Bex is associated with hypothyroidism so patients require \nthe concomitant administration of a replacement therapy with the \nthyroid hormone (TH) levothyroxine. We previously found that TH, \nmostly through the action on integrin \u03b1V\u03b23, contribute to the malig -\nnant phenotype of T cell lymphomas and other tumor cells. In this \nsense, we then analyzed TH effect on the proliferation of ME cells \nand found that physiological levels of T3 and T4 (1nM and 100nM, \nrespectively) induce 15 to 30% ME cell proliferation compare to con -\ntrol (p<0.05). We then evaluated if the TH proliferative effect influen -\nce Bex antineoplastic activity on ME cells. We treated cells with Bex \nfor 48h with or without TH and found that Bex activity on cell viability \nwas higher in the absence of TH (p<0.05) . Importantly, we found in \na skin cutaneous melanoma project from The Cancer Genome Atlas \nportal (TCGA-SKCM) that ME patients expresses RXR genes. We \nare now studying the inhibition of the TH membrane receptor, inte -\ngrin \u03b1V\u03b23, as possible adjuvant for Bex antiproliferative actions on \nME cells. Despite it should be studied more deeply, our preliminary \nresults point Bex as a new therapeutic option that could be conside -\nred in the future for ME treatment.\n283.

The mechanisms underlying \u03b1S aggregation, neurotoxicity \nand cell-to-cell transmission were explored in the context of PD. \nRecent evidence suggests that \u03b1S may also play a putative role in \nmelanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. Current studies \nsuggested that \u03b1S could be protective for advanced melanoma but \nits role in this type of cancer was not deeply explored yet.\nPreviously, we demonstrated by in vitro studies that melanoma \ncells are able to uptake different aggregation species of \u03b1S. These \nspecies were not toxic for melanoma cells. Instead, they promot -\ned proliferation, cytoskeleton rearrangement and migration. Here, \nwe evaluated the ability of human SK-MEL 28 and mouse B16-F10 \nmelanoma cells to form clones in the presence of \u03b1S fibers by stan -\ndard colony forming assays. Cells were incubated (or not) with \u03b1S \nfibers for 24 hours and 300 cells were plated to form colonies. For \nboth types of cells, incubation with \u03b1S promoted a higher number of \nclones ( P<0.01) of increased size ( P<0.05). We corroborated this \nresult by an in vivo experiment; subcutaneously injecting B16-F10 \ncells below the minimal tumorigenic dose in C57BL/6 mice (7.5x104 \ncells; n=5/group). By this approach, we observed that animals in -\njected with \u03b1S-treated cells developed tumors after 4 weeks (no \ntumor observed in control animals at this time). To further confirm \n\u03b1S role in melanoma progression, 2x105 B16-F10 cells (treated or \nnot) were subcutaneously injected in the right flank of C57BL/6 mice \n(n=7/group). Tumor volume was measured during 3 weeks. Growth \nkinetics indicated that \u03b1S treatment promoted melanoma growth \n(doubling time 2.34\u00b10.24 vs 2.74\u00b10.59 for control cells; P<0.05).\nAltogether, our data indicate that \u03b1S fibers are able to promote \ngrowth and clonogenicity of melanoma cells, suggesting a role for \n\u03b1S and \u03b1S-transmission in melanoma progression.\n284.

Mayo Clinic\nIn recent years, interest has been renewed regarding the role of \nthe immune system on tumor growth in breast cancer. In this work \nwe set out to determine the contribution of the immune system to \nantiprogestin-mediated tumor inhibition in ER+ PR+ (HR+) luminal \nbreast cancer. To do this, we transferred whole bone marrow from \nBALB/c-GFP mice to immunodeficient NSG mice and generated an \nimmunocompetent model (NSG-R). We observed that mifepristone \n(MFP) inhibited HR+ 59-2-HI tumor growth in NSG and NSG-R \nmice, similarly. However, MFP remodeled the immune landscape of \nNSG-R mice-treated tumors, favoring infiltration of MHC-II+ PD-L1+ \nmacrophages, CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) (p<0.05), NK, T lym -\nphocytes and decreasing the frequency of Tregs Foxp3+ (p <0.01) \nand MDSCs (p <0.001). At the transcriptomic level, it favored the ex -\npression of pro-inflammatory programs, with high levels of cytokines \nand chemokines (p <0.01) and particularly of an immunogenic death \nprogram (GSEA).

Treatment \nwith MFP favored the development of an immunological memory \ncapable of protecting against tumor re-challenge (p<0.001). Final -\nly, we observed that changes at the transcriptomic level and tumor \nmicroenvironment immune composition induced by MFP sensitized \nthe tumors to PD-L1 blockade (p<0.05). These results shed light \non the underlying mechanisms triggered by hormonal treatment on \nantitumor responses and to the rational design of new therapeutic \ncombinations in luminal-type breast cancer.\n285.

MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate \ngene expression. Circulating miRNAs can be detected in body flu -\nids. Aberrant expression of miRNAs in both tissues and fluids are \nlinked to several pathologies. Might plasma miRNAome associated \nto MeS influence BCa development and progression? The aim of \nthis work was to identify the circulating miRNAs in plasma of patients \nwith clinical features linked to MeS and their role in BCa. \nHealthy women from Hospital Militar Central (CABA) were recruited \nand divided in two groups, control or MeS-linked disease (MeSL) \nwhen presented two or more of these conditions: BMI\u226525.00 kg/m2, \nwaist diameter\u226582 cm or high blood pressure (systolic\u2265120, diastol -\nic\u226580). MiRNAs were isolated from plasma and a pool of each sam -\nples were hybridized to GeneChip\u00ae miRNA 4.0 Array (Affymetrix). \nWe found 24 miRNAs (FSG<0.05%, Log FC>1.5 and p value<0.01) \naltered in plasma of MeSL women and analyzed them by KEGG \nusing DIANA miRPath. These miRNAs were involved in several pro -\ncesses related to cancer including proteoglycans and transcriptional \nmisregulation in cancer. In particular, MeSL-downregulated miR-\n23a-3p, -19b-3p, -181a-5p, -122-5p, -425-5p, -28-3p, -146a-5p, \nlet-7b-5p and MeSL-upregulated miR-101-5p and -877-5p showed \nthe strongest association. We determined their expression levels \nin primary tumors (PT) and adjacent normal tissue of patients from \nTCGA BRCA data set. The miR-28-3p, -101-5p and let-7b-5p were \ndiminished while miR-181a-5p, -425-5p and -877-5p were increased \nin PT. Analysis using UCSC Xena tool showed that some miRNAs  \nexpression were dysregulated in a tumor subtype related manner. \nInterestingly, miR-877-5p correlated with decreased survival of BCa \npatients.\nOur results suggest that MeSL condition modifies miRNAs expres -\nsion profile from plasma which might impact on BCa.\n286.

Since in our \ncountry the mortality has doubled in last decades, finding prognostic \nand therapeutic targets appears a key task.Vav proteins are guanosine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for \nthe Rho GTPase family. They modulate processes highly associated \nto the development of cancer and metastasis. Classically the mem -\nbers of Vav family are considered proto-oncoproteins. However their \ninvolvement in melanoma is unknown. \nWe previously characterized the role of Vav2 in melanoma; now \nwe began to study the putative involvement of Vav3. First, by bio -\ninformatic approaches with human patients databases, we found \nthat Vav3 expression correlated with patient survival (p\u22640.0001). \nSecond, we modulated we modulated Vav3 expression in B16-F0 \ncells by transfection methods, generating cells with reduced and \nincreased expression of Vav3. By MTT assays we explored prolif -\neration, noting that decreased expression of Vav3 promotes pro -\nliferation (p\u22640.001) whereas increased levels of this protein affect -\ned negatively cell growth (p\u22640.001). By fluorescence studies with \nrhodamine-phalloidin staining we observed that Vav3 affected actin \ncytoskeleton and cell morphology. Cells with decreased Vav3 ex -\npression showed an improved migratory behavior as observed by \nwound healing assays (p \u2264 0.05). \nFinally, we injected cells subcutaneously in female 8-week old \nC57BL/6 mice (n=6/group). Tumor volume was measured biweek -\nly for 3 weeks. Growth kinetics indicated that decreased Vav3 ex -\npression promoted increased tumor proliferation (p\u22640.01) and lung \nmetastasis development. Increased Vav3 expression affected nega -\ntively melanoma growth (p\u22640.05).    \nAltogether, our results suggest a tumor suppressor role for Vav3 in \nmelanoma, in contraposition with the pro-tumoral function reported \nfor Vav2 in this tumor type and the classical role reported previously \nfor Vav3 in other tumors.\n287.

Tumor \ncells have an unlimited replicative potential, principally due to telo -\nmerase activity, which acts adding TTAGGG repetitions at the end \nof chromosomes in each cell division. For this activity it is necessary \nthe assembly of many components, where the most relevant are dis -\nkeryn (DKC1), the catalityc retrotranscriptase (hTERT) and the RNA \ntemplate (hTR). Telomerase complex is regulated in many levels, \nsuch as epigenetic regulation, transcriptional and post-traductional \nprocessing, intracellular compartmentalization, and recruitment and \nsubstrate accessibility. Considering these processes, so far different \nstrategies have been adopted to carry out novel telomerase inhibitor \ntherapies. This work aims to the development of new inhibitors of the \ntelomerase, selecting as target the interaction between hTR-DKC1. \nWe designed a model of the human protein DKC1, which was tested \nagainst a library of 300.000 drug-like molecules by virtual screening. \nWe selected the first 20 molecules that showed the highest affinity \nvalues to test it inhibitory activity on the mammary adenocarcinoma \ncell line MDA MD 231. After 48 hs of treatment with compound N\u00b010 \nat a dose of 2 mM, we found that telomerase activity diminished a \n57% (p <0.05). We continued with cell treatment for 55 passages, \nresulting in telomere shortening (66%, p <0.001), a rise in the ex -\npression of p16ink4a  gene (400%, p <0.05) and a positive staining \nof SA-\u03b2-galactosidase, which strongly confirms that cells are going \nthrough a senescence stage. Furthermore, we evaluated parame -\nters related with the apoptosis process, obtaining an increase both \nin bax/bcl2 ratio (>2.3, p<0.001) and in caspase 3 activity (155%, \np<0.01).  In order to improve the properties of the leader compound, \nwe designed 100 analogues and studied their affinity profile. We \nranked all the candidates and selected the 10 analogues with major \naffinity to carried out an in silico prediction of ADME/Tox properties. \nThese results allow us to postulate compound 10 and its analogues \nas novel inhibitors of telomerase activity with a potential clinical use ABSTRACTS131\nas an antitumoral drug.\n288.

Instituto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental, CONICET.\n2. University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora\n \nSeveral epidemiological studies, supported by experimental re -\nsearch, suggest that progestins exert a relevant role in breast car -\ncinogenesis. Thus, there is an increased interest in targeting proges -\nterone receptors (PR) for breast cancer treatment. We have recently \nshown that the antiprogestin mifepristone (MFP) inhibited cell prolif -\neration of breast cancer tissue cultures with higher levels of PR iso -\nform A (PRA) than B (PRB), highlighting the relevance of identifying \nmarkers to monitor antiprogestin responsiveness. Using RNA-seq \nwe have previously identified 139 genes differentially expressed \nin breast carcinomas with high or low PRA/PRB ratio (PRA-H and \nPRB-H, respectively). The aim of the study was to investigate the \nexpression of genes that could be used to monitor treatment re -\nsponsiveness. We focused in CPB1 and CRISP3, since both are \nsecreted proteins that might be detected in serum. We used two \nPRA-H (C4-HI and C7-2-HI) and two PRB-H (C42-HI and C7-HI) tu -\nmors from the medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)-induced murine \nbreast cancer model, and the human breast cancer cell lines, T47D-\nYA and T47D-YB. A statistically significant interaction was observed \nwhen the expression of CPB1 and CRISP3 was studied by qPCR in \ntumors treated with MFP or the progestin MPA (p<0.05). MFP down \nregulated CPB1 and CRISP3 expression in PRA-H tumors (p<0.05) \nand an opposite trend was observed in PRB-H tumors. We conclude \nthat CPB1 and CRISP3 might be good biomarkers to monitor MFP \nresponse. \n289.

Complejo M\u00e9dico Policial Churruca-Visca.\nBreast cancer cells induce metabolic reprogramming of peritumoral \nadipocytes, promoting adipocyte delipidation and atrophy/regres -\nsion. We have previously reported that peritumoral adipocytes \nshowed a decrease in the expression of Plin1, which together with \nHSL and ATGL regulate the lipolytic process, and smaller lipid drop -\nlet size. In this study we analyzed the effect of breast cancer cells \non expression of several proteins involved in the lipolytic process \nin explants of human adipose tissue of tumor (hATT) and non-tu -\nmor (hATN) breasts. Also, we evaluated the effect of conditioned \nmedia (CMs) from hATT and hATN on the lipolytic process of 3T3-\nL1 adipocytes. The expression of ATGL and HSL was analyzed by \nimmunohistochemistry and Western blot. Levels of both proteins \nwere increased in hATT with respect to hATN (p <0.05). Interest -\ningly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed an increase in the average num -\nber of lipid droplets (LD) per cell (p <0.01), and a decrease in LD \nsize and triglyceride accumulation after incubation with hATT-CMs \nvs hATN-CMs. HSL and Plin1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were increased \nafter incubation with hATT- vs hATN-CMs and Ctrol-CMs. In addi -\ntion, morphological changes in mitochondria were observed in adi -\npocytes because of CMs treatment. The results of indirect immuno -\nfluorescence revealed that about 90% of adipocytes incubated with \nhATT-CMs showed fragmented mitochondria, whereas about 60% \nof adipocytes incubated with hATN-CMs showed this change in their \nmitochondria. The highest percentage of mitochondrial fragmenta -tion per cell was more frequent in adipocytes treated with hATT-CMs \nvs hATN-CMs.\nIn summary, these findings suggest that peritumoral adipocytes un -\nderwent morphological and protein expression changes consistent \nwith activated lipolysis and this phenomenon could, in turn, promote \nlipolytic and mitochondrial alterations in adjacent adipocytes  by \nparacrine signaling.\n290.

We previously proposed that \n4-methylumbelliferone (4MU), known as an inhibitor of hyaluronan \n(HA) synthesis, would be an interesting new drug for leukemia treat -\nment. Previous results in our lab, showed that 4MU inhibited cell \nproliferation in a dose-dependent manner in human AML cell lines. \nMoreover, this drug was able to modulate mitochondrial status and \nROS production. However, it remains to assess whether the ob -\nserved effects are explained by the inhibition of HA synthesis. The \naim of this work was to analyze if the anti-tumor activity of 4MU \non U937 and THP-1 AML cells could be explained by HA synthesis \ninhibition. Results showed, that both AML cell lines were able to pro -\nduce significant quantities of AH (121.0 \u00b1 0.6 ng/ml and 107.6 \u00b1 0.5 \nng/ml, respectively) as assessed by ELISA. Surprisingly, 4MU was \nable to partially inhibit HA synthesis in THP-1 cells (p< 0.001) but \nnot in U937 cells at the doses tested. The addition of HA failed to \nprevent the effects of 4MU on metabolic activity and cell proliferation \nin both cell lines, evaluated by XTT and 3H-T uptake, respectively. \nMoreover, 4MU+HA co-treatment failed to prevent the increase in \nthe mean of fluorescence of NAO by FC, as well as the increase \nin ROS production, as it was evaluated also by FC with DCF-DA \nand MitoSox staining, in both cell lines. These results suggested \nthat there would be 4MU mechanisms independent of HA synthesis \ninhibition. To delve further into these mechanisms, we conducted a \nproteomic study in U937 cells after 4MU treatment by nano LC-MS/\nMS. Data analysis with free software RStudio resulted in 15 proteins \nmodulated by 4MU (p<0.05 and power>80), mainly related with cell \nmetabolism signatures, but not directly linked to HA synthesis mech -\nanisms. This finding expand the knowledge of 4MU for its potential \nuse in AML treatment.\n291.

V), 2020132\nBoron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT), based on the nuclear re -\naction 10B (n, \u03b1) 7Li, has been used to treat cutaneous melanoma in \ndifferent countries including Argentina. In previous studies in agree -\nment with the personalized oncology we have demonstrated that the \nresponse to BNCT might be correlated with tumor temperature and \nviability. The aim of these studies  was to develop a model of heat \ntransport that allows predicting the tumor response to BNCT. Meth -\nods and Materials : Nude mice implanted with human melanoma \ncells Mel J were divided into different groups (Control, beam only, \nBNCT) and exposed to the thermal neutron beam of the RA 6 nu -\nclear reactor clinical facility (4.96 x108 n/cm2sec). Tumor and body \ntemperatures were measured by Static Infrared Imaging (SIRI), \nand the follow up of the animals was performed. A heat transport \nmodel was developed, considering conduction, convection and an \ninternal heat source. From this model, the thermal conductivity of \nthe tumor was derived taking into account the internal and exter -\nnal temperatures, plus the ambient temperature and the size of the \ntumor. Then the conductivity was correlated with the boron concen -\ntration between tumor and blood (T/B) previously obtained by ICP \nOES measurements. Results:  Tumor growth showed a complete \ngrowth inhibition during the first 20 days after BNCT (p<0.001). It \nwas observed that tumors with higher temperatures corresponded \nto a greater degree of tumor growth control. Importantly, the results \nshowed that tumors with higher calculated thermal conductivity (be -\ntween 0.4 and 0.5 W / mK) and a higher derived boron concentration \nratio between tumor and blood showed a better response to BNCT. \nOn the other hand, tumors with lower thermal conductivity presented \ndifferent degrees of tumor inhibition (R= 0.8). Conclusions:  tumor \ncharacteristics, specially the temperature and the associated heat \ntransport model, could be used to plan a personalized BNCT treat -\nment for each patient.\n292.

In the current work we focused on \nthe study of Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion \n(ADME) properties of these analogues by SwissADME software, \nan in silico tool. The results showed that the analogues have simi -\nlar lipophilicity to calcitriol. The resulting log Po/w values were 5.02, \n6.27 and 5.03 for EM1, UVB1 and calcitriol, respectively. In addition, \nthe polar surface area (PSA) values obtained to EM1 (85.80 \u00c5\u00b2), \nUVB1 (80.92 \u00c5\u00b2) and calcitriol (60.69 \u00c5\u00b2) suggest the ability of the \nanalogues to cross cell membranes such as the blood-brain barri -\ner. In accordance with these results, BOILED-egg plots predict that \nboth analogues have high brain penetration, however they could \nbe efflux by p-glycoprotein as the analogues are substrates of this \npump. Regarding transdermal absorption, skin permeability coeffi -\ncients (log Kp) for EM1, UVB1 and calcitriol were -5.99 cm/s, -4.95 \ncm/s, -5.24 cm/s, respectively, suggesting the potential to adminis -\nter these compounds by this route. Moreover, Bioavailability Radar \nplots indicate that EM1 has similar properties to calcitriol for oral \nbioavailability while UVB1 needs to decrease its flexibility, lipophilia \nand size to be orally administered. Finally, the in silico prediction of \ngenotoxicity indicates that the analogues have non-mutagenic and \nnon-carcinogenic properties in AMES tests, the probabilities were \n0.8069 for EM1 and 0.94 for UVB1. Altogether, these  in silico analy -ses complement the reported in vitro and in vivo studies to reinforce \nthe use of these analogues as chemotherapeutic agents.\n293.

Wide -\nspread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels for screening \nhas led to a large increase in the incidence of diagnosed PCa and \na reduction in both, the advanced disease and PCa mortality rates. \nHowever, the overtreatment of PCa is widely recognized. For men \nwith newly diagnosed PCa, besides from stage, the strongest pre -\ndictor of lethal PCa is the Gleason score (GS). PCa grading has \nsignificantly improved since Gleason\u2019s original description in the \nmid-1960s. Literature reflects that, although some prostate cancers \n(PCas) are histo-pathologically grouped within the same GS, they \ncan differ significantly in aggressiveness. In this work, we aimed at \nidentifying molecular biomarkers that could improve risk prediction \nin PCa. In-depth proteomics analysis was performed on human \nPCa and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) tissues. We then val -\nidated the clinical significance of these peptides through an inte -\ngrative bioinformatics analysis using public database repositories. \nWe identified high expression of YWHAZ  and NDRG1  to be strongly \nassociated with poor PCa prognosis considering all Gleason scores. \nYWHAZ  and NDRG1  expression defined two clearly and distinct \nsubpopulations of patients with high and intermediate risk of dis -\nease progression. Adjusted multivariable analyses confirmed their \nindependence from GS, patient age and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. \nFurther, ROC analysis unveiled that YWHAZ  outperformed GS be -\nyond 60 months post-diagnosis. We hereby state the relevance of \nYWHAZ  in PCa, showcasing its role as an independent strong pre -\ndictor of aggressiveness, making it a potential prognostic tool when \ntaking into consideration the difficulties that PCa presents at the time \nof decision making.\n294.

Universidad \nNacional del Sur\n2-Departamento de Oncolog\u00eda B\u00e1sico-Cl\u00ednica, Universidad \nde Chile. \nMicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that participate in the \nregulation of mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level in physiological \nand pathological processes such as cell differentiation, migration, \nand invasion. The differential presence of the 3p and 5p isoforms \noriginating from the pre-microRNA precursor has recently been \ncorrelated with cancer initiation and progression. Previously, we ob -\ntained evidence that parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), \nwhich is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), induces mo -\nlecular changes promoting angiogenesis, Epithelial-Mesenchymal \nTransition (EMT), and cancer stem cell features in CRC cells. The \nobjective of this work was to explore the potential role of PTHrP \nin the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs, evaluating the ex -\npression of miR-423 and miR-27a isoforms in the normal intestinal ABSTRACTS133\nCCD841 CoN cell line and in HCT116 cells derived from colorectal \ncancer. miR-423 is increased in the plasma of CRC patients, while \nmiR-27a was identified as a tumor suppressor. Employing TaqMan \nMicroRNA assays by qPCR, we observed that PTHrP treatment \nfor 5 hours significantly increases the miR-423-3p and miR-423-\n5p transcripts levels in HCT116 cells; however, no changes were \nevidenced in CCD841 CoN cells at the studied times. In HCT116 \ncells, the transcription of miR-27a-5p increased at 5 hours of PTHrP \nexposure with a return to control levels within 24 hours. Differently, \nPTHrP induced a consistent decrease in miR-27a-3p transcription \nin HCT116 cells and CCD841 CoN cells at the same times. These \nresults highlight the relevance of the temporal coexistence of the \ntwo functional isoforms of these miRs and propose that miR-27a-3p \nisoform and miR-423 isoforms could be possible post-transcriptional \nregulators modulated by PTHrP in intestinal tumor cells.\n295. (415) FURTHER CHARACTERIZATION OF FXYD5/\nDYSADHERIN EXPRESSION IN ENDOMETRIAL CANCER \nAND ITS ASSOCIATION TO TUMOR PROGRESSION AND \nTREATMENT\nD\u00e9bora Michelle Catalano, Maria Jos\u00e9 Besso, M\u00f3nica  Vaz -\nquez-Levin\nIBYME\nAim:Endometrial cancer (EC) is 6th most frequent women cancer \nworldwide. Stage IA endometroid EC (EEC) patients have good \nprognosis, and a conservative treatment of Medroxyprogesterone \nacetate (MPA) is applied to patients attempting fertility preservation \nor unsuitable candidates for surgery. However, MPA response is par -\ntial or nule, and recurrence is reported. Using cell models and pa -\ntient samples, we demonstrated an increased expression of FXYD5/\nDysadherin (Dys) in ECC. In cell models, we found a negative asso -\nciation between Dys and E-cadherin/CDH1, activation of TGF-\u03b2 and \nNF-\u03baB pathways, and cytokine expression. In this study, we further \nevaluated Dys expression, association with ECC progression and \nwith MPA response.\nM&M:mRNA expression of Dys and related molecules was analyzed \nin EC patient datasets, and in MPA-resistant Ishikawa EEC cells and \ncontrol (GSE121367).\nResults:A negative (p<0.05; Spearman) association was confirmed \nbetween CDH1 and Dys mRNA expression (TCGA total dataset \nn=388, and Stage IA samples n=140). Dys expression was high -\ner in Stage IA EC samples than in atrophic controls (GSE17025; \np<0.05; Mann Whitney). A positive (p<0.05) association was found \nbetween Dys expression and markers of TGF-\u03b2 (TGF-beta1, ZEB1, \nZEB2, SNAI1, SERPINE1, SMAD3) and NF-\u03baB (CCL2, TNF-alpha, \nCCL17, CCL22, IL6, IL10) pathways. A positive correlation was \nfound between Dys levels and CD68 (monocyte lineage), CD163 \n(macrophage) and  FOXP3 (Treg) markers (p<0.05). MPA-resistant \nIshikawa cells showed lower (p<0.05) expression of CDH1 mRNA, \nand higher (p<0.05) expression of Dys and related markers (ZEB1, \nZEB2, SAMD3, CCL22, CD68, TNFRSFB) than control cells.\nConclusion:Results confirm Dys mRNA expression in ECC patients, \nand its negative correlation with CDH1 expression. Findings also \nreveal a possitive association of Dys with molecular markers of im -\nmune system and inflammatory response in EC, and give new in -\nsights into potential Dys role in EC MPA treatment resistance.\n296. (422) FURTHER CHARACTERIZATION OF EPHRINB1 \nAND EPHB2 EXPRESSION IN BLADDER CANCER AND \nITS ASSOCIATION WITH TUMOR PROGRESSION AND \nAGGRESSIVENESS\nValentina Scardigno, Maria Victoria Mencucci, Monica Hebe \nVazquez-Levin.\nIBYME\nAim: Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the ten solid tumors with highest \nincidence/mortality worldwide. Clinically, it is classified as non-mus -\ncle-invasive (NMIBC; Ta-T1 stages) and muscle-invasive (MIBC; \nT2-T4 stages). Samples are also classified by tumor grade (G1 to \nG3, G3 most aggressive). BC molecular classification has also been \nreported.  In a murine model of BC progression/aggressiveness, \nwe reported \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation, higher expression of Ephrin B1 (EFNB1) ligand and its EphB2 (EPHB2) receptor, and \nSTAT3-related pathway activation. Also, increased expression of \nEFNB1 protein was shown in BC patients (Mencucci et al, 2020). \nThis study aimed to further characterize EFNB1 and EPHB2 expres -\nsion in BC.\nM&M: Datasets were queried to analyze EFNB1 and EPHB2 mRNA \nlevels in BC patients (GSE13507, GSE32894). To explore binding \nsites of TCF4 transcription factor to EFNB1 and EPHB2 promoters, \na set of programs were used (Ensembl, Methyl Primer Express v1.0, \nPROMO).\nResults: EFNB1 mRNA levels were higher in tumor samples (n=165) \nthan in mucosa surrounding cancer (n=58); Ta and T1, and G1 tu -\nmors had higher expression levels than controls (p<0.005). Higher \nEPHB2 transcript was also found in tumor samples compared to \ncontrols (p=0.0106), and in T3 tumors depicted higher mRNA lev -\nels (p=0.0130). EPHB2 mRNA levels were higher in G1 and G2 \ntumors (GSE13507), and in G3 compared to G1 and G2 tumors \n(GSE32894). A positive correlation was found between EFNB1 and \nEPHB2 mRNA levels (r=0.2775; p=0.0074; Spearman). Survival \nanalysis revealed an association between EPHB2 expression and \nDisease Free Survival (p=0.0158). Using molecular classification \nreported by Sj\u00f6dahl (2012), EPHB2 mRNA was higher in SCC-like \n(worse prognosis) molecular subtype than in all others (p<0.05). \nPromoter analysis identified TCF4 binding sequences in EFNB1 and \nEPHB2 promoters.\nConclusion: EFNB1 and EPHB2 mRNA expression was validated, \nshowing an association with BC progression disease/aggressive -\nness.\n297.

Nowadays, there are approximately \n10 compounds on the market targeting EGFR. However, their ef -\nfectiveness is limited in patient subpopulation with specific genetic \ncharacteristics and due to acquired resistance. Radioimmunothera -\npy (RIT) is based on radiolabeled proteins targeting cancer-associ -\nated structures. Besides antibodies, alternative protein formats with \ndifferent pharmacokinetic characteristic such as nanobodies (VHH) \nhave been explored for radionuclides diagnosis in the recent years. \nThe aim of this project is to obtain a novel radiopharmaceuticals \nbased in 177Lu and VHH against EGFR receptor (VHH-EGFR) for \ntheragnostic application. First, we labelled a monomeric VHH-EGFR \nwith 177Lu and characterized its performance in kras mutated and \nwild type cancer cells in colony assay. The results showed a specific \nand significative therapeutic effect in kras mutated respect wild type \nkras cancer cells. However, for in vivo application, it is necessary \nto slightly increase its size in order to avoid quick renal clearance \nand achieve a therapeutic effect. At this moment, we are working in \ndifferent strategies to slightly increase nanobody size, for instance \nadding an albumin binder or perform VHH dimers to improve its \npharmacokinetic and therapeutic effect in future in vivo experiments.\n298.

The MSN were synthetized and functionalized to \nuse them on 2D and 3D cell cultures of B16F10 and U251.\nIs still under discussion how cells interact with different types of \nnanoparticles, their cytotoxicity and selectivity. For this reason, we \nfocused on studying in detail this MSN-cell membrane interaction \nthrough Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). To verify the pres -\nence of MSN, energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was \nused as a complementary technique. Also, confocal microscopy \nexperiments were carried out to compare the results between both \nmicroscopy techniques. \nThe main challenge was focused on preserving all the character -\nistics of the cell structure in the steps prior to its analysis by SEM. \nFor this, a chemical dehydration and drying method was developed \nin order to avoid the use of expensive equipment, such as Critical \nPoint Drying or Cryomicroscopy. We developed a cheap, fast, and \nreproducible method for cell fixation and dehydration, preserving the \nnatural characteristics of the samples.\n299.

Galarza, Graciela P. Cricco, \nGabriela A.  Mart\u00edn.\nLaboratorio de Radiois\u00f3topos, Facultad de Farmacia y Bio -\nqu\u00edmica. Universidad de Buenos Aires.\nWe have previously determined that histamine dose-dependently \nmodulates cell proliferation, metalloproteases activity and migration \nin the human pancreatic cancer cells PANC-1 and BxPC3. In vivo, \nthe histamine H2 receptor (H2R) antagonist ranitidine hindered the \ngrowth of PANC-1 and BxPC3 grafts and the development of PANC-\n1 lung metastasis in nude mice.\nThe aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of the H2R agonist \namthamine on proliferation, gelatinolytic activity and migration in \nPANC-1 and BxPC3 cells.\nResults from dose-response curves showed that 100 nM amthamine \nin PANC-1 and 10 \u00b5M in BxPC3 increased the number of colonies by \nthe clonogenic assay (p<0.05 vs control) while the H2R antagonist \nranitidine blocked these effects. Immunoblot studies revealed an en -\nhancement in the expression of cyclin E2 (p<0.05 vs control) and a \nsignificant increase in phospho-ERK1/2 levels (p<0.01 vs control) \nin both cell lines. Interestingly, MEK inhibitor PD98059 counteract -\ned both ERK activation and clonogenicity induced by amthamine \n(p<0.01 vs amthamine).\nBesides, MMP2 in PANC-1 and MMP9 gelatinolytic activity in BxPC3 \nwere increased when cells were treated with 100 nM (p<0.05) and \n10 \u00b5M amthamine (p<0.01), respectively. Cell migration studies us -\ning transwell units showed that these amthamine concentrations in -\ncreased the migratory capacity in both cell lines (p<0.05 vs control). \nThese effects were associated with Src kinase activation/phosphor -\nylation since amthamine augmented phospho-Src levels (p<0.01 vs \ncontrol) and the selective Src inhibitor PP2 blocked the increase in \nthe number of migrated cells (p<0.05 vs amthamine).\nCollectively, results suggest that H2R might be at least partially in -\nvolved in the stimulatory action exerted by histamine on cell prolif -\neration, gelatinolytic activity and cell migration in pancreatic cancer \ncells and support the in vivo role of ranitidine in the growth of PANC-\n1 and BxPC3 xenotransplanted tumors and lung metastasis in nude \nmice.\n300.

Laboratorio de Oncolog\u00eda Molecular, Universidad Nacional \nde Quilmes.\nBIRC6 (baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 6) is a member of \nthe inhibitors of apoptosis protein family thought to play an important \nrole in the progression or chemoresistance of many cancers. The \naim of this study was to investigate the role of BIRC6 in triple nega -\ntive breast cancer (TNBC).\n Firstly, we analyzed BIRC6 mRNA expression levels and Copy \nNumber Variations (CNV) in three Breast Cancer databases (TCGA)  \nusing cBioPortal and USCSXena platforms comparing clinical and \nmolecular attributes. In addition, we analyzed the BIRC6 expression \nin murine (F3II) and human (MDA-MB-231) TNBC cell lines by im -\nmunofluorescence. Moreover, we used a recombinant baculovirus \nable to silence BIRC6 previously constructed in our lab. Then, we \ndetermined apoptosis levels in F3II cells by TUNEL.\n Our bioinformatics results showed that there was a differential ex -\npression of BIRC6 in cancer samples compared to normal samples \n(normal= -0,372\u00b10,395, cancer= 0,113\u00b11,055; t-test , p<0,001). \nTNBC tumors have higher proportions of birc6  CNV amplifications \nand gains compared to those found in hormone dependent tumors \n(ER+: 2% gain, <1% amp; ER-: 15% gain, 2% amp; PR+: 1% gain, \n<1% amp; PR-: 9% gain, 1% amp; \u03c72, p<0,05). Moreover, we found \nthat there was a differential expression of apoptotic, PI3K/AKT/\nmTOR and Ras-MAPK pathways in conditions of high expression \nof BIRC6 ( t-test, p<0,05), and also a strong correlation between the \nexpression of proteins involved in these pathways and BIRC6 ( Pear -\nson correlation ). Finally, we demonstrated that baculovirus efficient -\nly transduced TNBC cell lines and elicited a reduction in the BIRC6 \nprotein levels. Silencing baculovirus exerts a pro-apoptotic action ( t \n-test, p<0,05). \n These preclinical data suggest that BIRC6 would be proposed as \na therapeutic target for gene therapy on the treatment of TNBC tu -\nmors.\n301.

Centro Oncol\u00f3gico de Integraci\u00f3n Regional (COIR) Men -\ndoza\nThe heat shock protein HSP90 plays important roles in protein \nhomeostasis. The inducible form, HSP90\u03b1, may be an attractive \ntarget for new anticancer therapies, as many of its client proteins \nare involved in cancer hallmarks. The phosphorylated form in Thr-7 \n(p-HSP90\u03b1) accumulates at the DNA damage sites and has been \nproposed as a biomarker of genomic instability. Cisplatin (cisPt) \nis used for the treatment of solid tumors, but resistance limits its \nefficacy. Therefore, it is important to identify biomarkers to predict \ntreatment response. Our aim was to evaluate the predictive/prog -\nnostic value of p-HSP90\u03b1 in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from \ncisPt-treated cancer patients. PBL from 7 healthy persons and 52 pa -\ntients before chemotherapy were in vitro exposed to cisPt (200 \u00b5M, 1 \nh). The cells were harvested at: T0 (immediately after cisPt), at T24 \nand at T48 (after a recovery period of 24h and 48h, respectively). \nNuclear and cytoplasmic expression of p-HSP90\u03b1 was evaluated by \nimmunocytochemistry. At basal conditions, cytoplasmic and nuclear \np-HSP90\u03b1 did not show statistically significant differences between \nhealthy individuals and cancer patients. After cPt-treatment, the cy -\ntoplasmic levels of the protein did not significantly differ between \nexperimental conditions, in both controls and patients. In contrast, \nthe nuclear expression of p-HSP90\u03b1 significantly increased in pa -\ntients at T24 (P<0.0001) and at T48 (P<0.001). No statistically signif -\nicant differences were found between patients with complete clinical \nresponse to chemotherapy and those with partial response, stable \nor progressive disease with respect to the cytoplasmic or nuclear \np-HSP90\u03b1 expression. In addition, no significant associations with ABSTRACTS135\ncancer patient?s survival outcomes were also found. Our prelimi -\nnary data indicate that immunocytochemical detection of p-HSP90\u03b1 \nin PBL from cancer patients does not appear to be a useful tool for \neither prognosis or response to cisPt-based chemotherapy.\n302. (465) DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSE TO FREE AND ENCAP -\nSULATED CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS IN GLIOMA \nAND MELANOMA CELLS\nMaria Jose Gattas  (Instituto de Nanosistemas, UNSAM, Bue -\nnos Aires, Arg.) , Maria de los Angeles Ramirez (Instituto de \nNanosistemas, UNSAM) , Galo Soler Illia (Instituto de Nano -\nsistemas, UNSAM) , Sergio Moya  (CIC biomagune, San Se -\nbastian, Espa\u00f1a) , Marina Simian (Instituto de Nanosistemas)\nWe aimed to study the effectiveness of MCM41 silica NPs as po -\ntential drug carriers for glioblastoma and melanoma tumor cells. \nThree drugs (Cis- platinum, Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel)  of different \nchemical nature were encapsulated in MCM41 NPs with differential \npore functionalization.  In particular for Cis-Platinum, we funtional -\nized NPs with SATES. Secondly, for Doxorrubicin we funtionalized \nNPs with APTES and for the loading of Paclitaxel, we left the porus \nwithout funtionalizatio.\nA chemical study of loading and release of the drugs was carried \nout under physiological conditions. MTT assays were performed on \ntwo human glioblastoma cell lines (U251 and U87) and a murine \nmelanoma cell line, B16F10. Cytotoxicity was measured at 24, 48 \nand 72 hours of incubation. \nOur experiments revealed  that cell viability in response to the drugs \nwas different for each cell line. B16F10  cells were susceptible to \nencapsulated and free  Cis- platinum at  48 and  72 hours (n=3; \np< 0.001)   and  the empty NP showed no toxicity.  U251 cells re -\nsponded to free and encapsulated Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel (n= 3; \np<0.001) and were not affected by the empty NPs. U87 cells did not \nrespond to any of the drugs either in their free form or encapsulated \nin NP.  \nOur results show that the effectiveness  of nanoformulations is de -\npendent on cell context and that results in one cell line should not be \nextrapolated to other systems.\n303.

Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de \nBuenos Aires.\nThe presence of multidrug resistance efflux transporters, such as \nthe P-glycoprotein (Pgp) on the blood brain barrier (BBB), limits the \nefficacy of chemotherapeutic agents on brain tumors or metastasis. \nThe antiprogestin mifepristone (MFP) is known to inhibit Pgp activity \non tumor cells. The murine mammary carcinoma C4-2-HI, whose \ngrowth is not inhibited by MFP treatment and the human triple neg -\native MDA-231Br cells were injected into the brain as previously de -\nscribed. Both models are sensitive to Doxorubicin (doxo) treatment. \nHowever, when low doxo doses were used, a significant decrease \nin tumor size was only observed in mice treated with MFP and doxo \n(p<0.05). We hypothesized that MFP inhibits the activity of BBB Pgp \nallowing a high entry of doxo to the brain. Human Brain Microvas -\ncular Endothelial Cells (HBMEC) were treated with doxo (20 \u03bcM) \nwith or without MFP (10 \u03bcM) for 60 or 120 min. An increase in the \nintracellular retention of doxo was observed in MFP-treated cells \n(fluorescence intensity; p<0.05). In addition, we evaluated the ex -\npression of Pgp by Western blots in HBMEC cells treated with MFP \nfor 24 hours in the presence or absence of dexamethasone, which \nis known to induce Pgp overexpression. MFP showed an inhibitory \neffect in both experimental settings (p=.05) We conclude that MFP may be a promising agent to increase the effectiveness of chemo -\ntherapeutic agents on brain tumors, regardless of their progesterone \nreceptor expression through its action on BBB Pgp.\n304. (473) INTRATUMORAL GENE SILENCING OF MUSCARIN -\nIC RECEPTORS BY RNA INTERFERENCE DECREASE \nHUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS GROWTH.\nGiambalvo D1, Acebedo M1, Ferraiolo P1, Rebagliati Cid A1, \nMaterazzi L1, Lombardi MG1.\n1. Laboratorio de Oncoinmunolog\u00eda Molecular. Centro de Es -\ntudios Farmacol\u00f3gicos y Bot\u00e1nicos (CEFYBO) - CONICET/\nUBA.\nThe ability of interfering RNA (RNAi) to silence target genes with \nhigh efficiency and specificity has stimulated efforts to develop these \nmolecules as therapeutic agents in oncology. It has been reported \nthat human breast cancer MCF-7 cells express muscarinic recep -\ntors (MR) M3 and M4 subtypes and its activation promotes tumoral \nprogression. The aim of this work was to evaluate if intratumoral \ndelivery of RNAi against M3 and M4 affects the growth kinetics of \nMCF-7 cells,  in vivo .  For this, cells treated with or without the cho -\nlinergic agonist carbachol (Carb, -8M), were injected subcutaneous -\nly in female Balb/c NUDE mice (1x107cells/0.2mL) that had been \nimplanted with a 17\u03b2-estradiol pellet (1mg) a week earlier. After 5 \ndays, mice had small visible tumors and were divided into groups: \nMCF-7 cells (control) and MCF-7+Carb (RNAi once, RNAi repeat -\ned (once a week, four times) and without RNAi). Tumor diameter \nwere measured three times per week and the tumoral volume was \nestimated. After 38 days, all mice were sacrificed, the tumors were \nphotographed and measured. The data analysis showed that tu -\nmors of cells stimulated with Carb had higher growth kinetic and \ntumor volume compared to control group (day 38: 527.5\u00b177.6 mm3 \nvs. 740.5\u00b172.8 mm3;p<0,001).  Additionally, repeated RNAi treat -\nment against M3M4 subtypes decrease MCF-7+Carb cells capacity \nto growth (day 38: control: 527.5\u00b177.6 mm3 vs. MCF-7+Carb+RNAi \nrepeated: 165.2\u00b159.8 mm3;p<0,0001).  We also found that tumoral \nweight of RNAi-repeated group was significantly lower than MCF-\n7+Carb without RNAi and MCF-7+Carb+RNAi once (100mg\u00b157.1 \nvs. 335mg\u00b143.8 (p<0,01) and 261.5mg\u00b169.8 (p<0,05), respec -\ntively) . Our results show that intratumoral administration of naked \nRNAi is an effective systemic delivery and prevents its degradation.  \nWe observed that gene silencing of MRs, by weekly administration \nof specific RNAis, decrease both MCF-7 tumors weight and their \ngrowth kinetic; suggesting that MR are important therapeutic targets.\n305.

(485) ESTROGEN RECEPTOR-ID4 CROSS-TALK IN \nBREAST CANCER\nDaniela Lucia  Nasif, Maria Roqu\u00e9 Moreno, Mar\u00eda Teresita \nBranham\n(IHEM-CONICET)\nInhibitor of differentiation (ID) 4, a member of the ID family, has been \nshown to act as a tumor suppressor and as an oncogene in breast \ncancer. Our group has investigated this apparent discordant infor -\nmation and has found evidence that ID4 acts as a tumor suppressor \nonly in estrogen receptor ER+ tumors and as an oncogene only in \nER- tumors. Here we focus on ID4?s tumor suppressor role and \nfurther investigate why ID4 is aberrantly methylated exclusively in\nER+ tumors.EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase involved in the \ntri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) and also \npromotes DNA methylation via DNMT recruitment. In breast can -\ncer EZH2 is overexpressed and downregulates the expression of \ntumor suppressor genes via increased promoter H3K27me3. Since \nID4 is hyper-methylated in ER+ tumors and since EZH2 expression \nis induced by estradiol we hypothesize that estradiol induces ID4 \nmethylation through EZH2. We performed siRNA (EZH2), immu -\nnofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) experi -\nments in MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. Our results show that EZH2 \nregulates ID4 expression as confirmed by siRNA experiments, that \nestrogen treatment increases EZH2 expression and ID4 methylation \nand CHIP experiments reveal that estrogen administration increas -\nes EZH2 and H3K27me3 marks on ID4 promoter. Taken\ntogether our results show for the first time that estradiol induces ID4 \nmethylation trough EZH2 in breast cancer cell lines.\n307.

SFT are \noften pleura neoplasms, rarely occurring in the meninges. Most of \nthese tumors harbor a NAB2 \u2013STAT6 gene fusions. The activation \ndomain of STAT6 converts NAB2 from an EGR1 repressor to an acti -\nvator. EGR1 has been shown to activate VEGF, involved in vascular \ndevelopment, and to enhance HIF1\u03b1, involved in tumor glycolytic \nphenotype. Here, we present a multidisciplinary work from the clinic \nto the basic research of a SFT. After being clinically evaluated, a \n45 years old woman underwent a gross total resection of a highly \nvascularized right frontal parasagittal meningeal tumor. The immu -\nnohistochemistry (IHC) showed a strong nuclear positivity for STAT6 \nconfirming SFT entity. Next, we were able to establish a primary cul -\nture from a fragment of this tumor both as monolayer and spheroids \nin DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% SFB and ATBs. Preliminary \nresults showed that SFT primary cultures viability (determined by \nCrystal Violet staining, 5 days after treatment) resulted particularly \naffected with the combination of metformin (an oral antidiabetic drug \nwith potential antitumor activity) with 2DG (up to 80%), which is a \nglucose analog that inhibits Hexokinase (HK, the first and limiting \nenzyme of glycolysis ) and with 6-AN (up 60 %), which is a Glucose-6 \nphosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD, the first and limiting enzyme of \nPentose Phosphate Pathway) inhibitor. In addition, we found that \nSFT cells express iNOS (by immune staining), a potential drugga -\nble enzyme probably involved in the highly vascularized phenotype \nof these tumors. Then, we hypothesize that the biological features \nof SFT may provide therapeutic opportunities for its treatment. Our \nresults denote the relevance of a multidisciplinary work and support \nfurther studies to uncover the remarkable mechanisms behind the \nnature of SFT. \n308.

Administration of an -\ntineoplastic drugs in nanovehicles (NV) optimizes the localization \nof drugs in tumor tissue. This occurs manly due to the enhance -\nment permeably retention effect that reduce peripheral toxicity and \nincrease the local therapeutic effectiveness. Oxaliplatin (Oxp) is a \nhigh efficiency chemotherapeutic drug but with adverse effects, thus \nthe encapsulation could significantly improve the effect. Moreover, \nthe combination with sensitizing molecules, such as curcumin (Cur), \ncould yet increase the possibilities of therapy success. This mole -\ncule is hydrophobic, so its encapsulation in NV also could improve \nits delivery. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of Cur \ncombined with Oxp in a chemoresistant in-vivo  model encapsulated \nin NV performed by microfluidic technology. We generate an in-vivo  \nchemoresistant model by serial passaging of bulk T84 subcutane -\nous tumor xenografts in nude mice treated with Oxp and re-derived \nat least by four times, resulting in a solid tumor that no respond to \nOxp treatment. Furthermore we developed a microfluidic chip for the \nencapsulation of Oxp in liposomes, obtaining NV of 125.9\u00b11.5nm \nand 0.23mg/ml Oxp. Moreover, we performed Cur polymeric mi -\ncelles of 21.3\u00b11.4nm and 2.5mg/ml. In first term we test the Cur \n(20mM) and Oxp (40mM) effect in a T84ROxp cells administrated \nindependly or in combination in-vitro  assays (MTT assay), obtaining \na cell survival of 70% vs 50% respectively. Next we evaluated these ABSTRACTS137\ntreatments in the in-vivo  model. We administrated both compounds \nfree and encapsulated in NV independently or in combination (i.v) \nand obtained similar effects, but with toxicity signal in mice, such \nloss of weigh. However, the administration of Cur and Oxp in NV \nimproved significantly the effectiveness in tumor and avoided the \nperipheral toxicity.\n309.

Patients from diverse countries show different microbial pro -\nfiles, thus led us to analyze the microbiota in breast cancer patients \nin Argentina. \nIn order to study  the prognostic relevance of the microbiota in the \nevolution of early breast cancer, a study was carried out including bi -\nopsies of frozen/fresh breast tumor tissues (Hospital Roffo, n=7 and \nHospital Italiano, n=1, respectively). Inclusion criteria: women with \ninvasive ductal breast carcinoma, clinicopathological stage I/II with \na 5-year follow-up minimum. Exclusion criteria: patients with prior \ntreatment, underlying immune disease or another prior tumor. Sam -\nples were processed and DNA was extracted using the QIAamp-\nDNA-Mini-Kit. The bacterial profile was identified studying V4-V4 hy -\npervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. OTUs classification and \nAlpha and Beta diversity analysis were performed, in order to study \npossible associations with parameters such as age, tumor size, his -\ntological grade, Ki-67, Her2/neu, ER, PR, axillary lymph nodes and \ntumor evolution. \nTaxonomic analysis of these samples indicated that Firmicutes \n(34.6%) and Proteobacteria (30.8%) are the most representative \nphyla. We observed that the sample from the H. Italiano presented \ngreater diversity (165k) than the ones from the H. Roffo (43k-96k), \ntherefore the first was not taken into account for the analysis. Alpha \ndiversity analysis showed a significant difference between tumor \ndimensions, showing a decrease in diversity with the tumor size in -\ncrease (p-value <0.0001, \u201ct-test\u201d two-tailed). \nTo conclude, H.

The analysis of GE -\nPIA database showed that not significant differences of HVCN1 ex -\npression (Transcripts per Millon) appears between normal (N=291) \nand pathological (N=1085) mammary tissues. However, we ob -\nserved different HVCN1 expression levels within tumor samples of \nthe Breast Cancer METABRIC, Nature 2012 & Nat Commun 2016 \nstudy. Selecting samples in which HVCN1 mRNA level was major \nto one standard deviation of the median (high Hv1 group; N=250) \nand compared this group with the rest of the samples (control group; \nN=1653), we observed that the high Hv1 group contains a signifi -\ncantly increased number of triple negative and claudin-low samples \nrespect to the control group (Chi-quadrate test, p<10-10), and found \nthat 4530 genes are significantly enriched (Student test) in the high \nHv1 group, including metabolic reprograming related genes such as \nGLUT3 (p=3.07e-19), GLUT5 (p=4.66e-25), PFKP (p=9.44 6e-9) and \nPFKL (p=2.04e-3), which are indicated as key genes of glycolytic \nflux. Altogether, our results demonstrated that Hv1 expression could \nbe associated invasive subtypes and glycolytic phenotype, pointing \nout the role of this channel in breast cancer.\n311.

The histamine H4 receptor (H4R) has been characterized \nin TNBC experimental models, demonstrating its critical role in tumor \ndevelopment and progression. Limited information about the asso -\nciation of H4R expression with markers of prognosis is available. \nIn this study, we investigated the H4R expression in samples of 26 \nTNBC patients and its correlation with clinicopathological features, \nand survival estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Positive H4R \nimmunoreactivity was observed in about 65% and 81% of tumor \nspecimens and peritumoral breast tissue, respectively. A moderate \npositive correlation was found between the expression of H4R in \nthe tumoral and peritumoral tissue (Spearman r: 0.4412, P=0.0398). \nElevated H4R expression in peritumoral tissue and tumors was ob -\nserved in patients with negative lymph node metastasis and unifocal \nTNBC. Even more, a negative correlation between H4R expression \nand the number of lymph node involvement was observed in peri -\ntumoral tissue (Spearman r: -0.5429, P=0.0110), accompanied by a \nsimilar tendency in relation to the tumor size. However, no significant \nassociation was observed between the H4R expression and tumor \ngrade, stage, Ki67 percentage and lymphovascular invasion in both \ntumor and histologically-normal samples. Negative H4R expression \nwas associated with reduced survival.\nIn summary, these results suggest that H4R might represent a po -\ntential prognostic biomarker in TNBC patients. Further studies in \nlarger cohorts are needed to better understand the significance of \nH4R in breast cancer biology.\n312. (558)  MUTATIONS IN RB1 GENE IN RETINOBLASTOMA \nPATIENTS\nParma D, Luce L, Carcione M, Mazzanti C, Giliberto F, Szijan I\nC\u00e1tedra de Gen\u00e9tica/INIGEM-CONICET, Facultad de Farma -\ncia y Bioqu\u00edmica, UBA\nRetinoblastoma (RB) is the most frequent intraocular malignant tu -\nmor in childhood, caused by mutations in RB1 tumor suppressor MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020138\ngene. RB may be hereditary (bilateral tumors) or non-hereditary \n(mostly unilateral tumors). The first mutation can be  germinal (RB \nhereditary) or somatic (RB non-hereditary), the second mutation is \nalways somatic. RB is a potentially curable cancer depending on \nearly diagnosis and treatment . Besides, patients with hereditary \nRB can transmit the predisposition to their offspring. The aim of our \nwork is the identification of RB1 mutations, for risk assessment in \nthe offspring and siblings of bilateral patients and for discrimination \nbetween hereditary and non-hereditary RB in unilateral patients. \nOut of a total of 215 patients with RB studied in our lab, the re -\nsults of 2 bilateral and 2 unilateral are presented here. Mutational \ndetection was conducted by a combined approach of Exome anal -\nysis and MLPA. Variants in donor splicing sites were detected in \nthe 2 bilateral patients: c.1389+1G>A and c.2106+1del. Moreover, \na newly born sibling could be excluded from RB risk. One of the \nunilateral patients showed a homozygous  deletion of RB1 entire \ngene and surrounding genes ( ITM2B-5,RCBTB2-8,DLEU1-2 ) in \nthe tumor; this mutation was not present in blood DNA, denoting a \nnon-hereditary RB. The other unilateral patient displayed a hetero -\nzygous germline deletion of whole RB1 gene and neighboring genes          \n(ITM2B-5,RCBTB2-8,DLEU1-2,PCDH8-3,PCDH8-2 ), denoting a \nhereditary RB and a likely contiguous deletion syndrome. The 3\u2019 end \nwas not found, that is, the deletion continues beyond PCDH8.\nIdentification of RB1 mutations allows detection of RB predisposition \nin patient\u00b4s offspring and siblings which provides access to early \ntreatment to preserve survival and vision. Identification of germinal \nmutations in unilateral patients allows detecting the risk of tumor \ndevelopment in the other eye and its absence eliminates the need \nfor frequent eye exams under anesthesia . \n313.

The PSI domain interacts with the plas -\nma membrane, causing cell permeabilization, thus killing plant and \nhuman pathogens. A typical Solanum tuberosum AP ( StAP) named \nas StAP3 was demonstrated to have cytotoxic activity against can -\ncer cells and no effect in normal cells in vitro. The toxicity of StAP3 \nwas assessed in a mice model, showing no signs of systemic tox -\nicity. Malignant melanoma (MM) is one of the most aggressive can -\ncers, with high metastatic ability and resistant to therapies. Thus, \nthe pursuing of novel agents against MM is still challenging. Herein, \nwe aimed to evaluate the in vivo  antitumor effect of StAP3 in MM. \nSubcutaneous A375 human melanoma xenografts in athymic nude \nmice were induced. Once tumors developed (mean larger dimen -\nsion = 3.8 \u00b1 0.09 mm), mice were treated with StAP3 (6 \u00b5g/mg body \nweight, subcutaneously under the tumor at a single dose) or phys -\niologic solution (controls). Animal experiments complied with the \nARRIVE guidelines and were performed with protocols approved by \nthe Argentine National Atomic Energy Commission Animal Care in \naccordance with the EU Directive 2010/63/EU and NIH Publications \nNo. 8023, revised 1978. A significant inhibition of MM tumors growth \nwas observed in StAP3-treated mice (p < 0.05) vs. controls. This was detected immediately after treatment and was sustained until \n15 days post-treatment, with a maximum inhibition of 76%, when \ncontrol tumors reached 200 mm3 and animals were sacrificed. As \nfar as we know, this is the first report showing the in vivo  effect of a \nplant AP whose action mechanism would be mediated by membrane \ndestabilization, which may be explained by the plasma membrane \ncomposition with high levels of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaf -\nlet of cancer cells. These results suggest the potential of these plant \nproteases as anticancer agents.\n314.

Instituto de Investigaciones en Medicina Traslacional, Uni -\nversidad Austral.\nTaxane-platin chemotherapy is widely used for non-small cell lung \ncancer (NSCLC). However, the majority of patients will progress or \nrelapse. In the tumor microenvironment (TME) cancer cells co-exist \nwith cellular and non-cellular components that drive tumor process -\nes such as chemotherapy resistance. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are \ntumor initiating cells identified by CD133, CD44 and ALDH1 among \nothers markers, which form residual niches involved in tumor recur -\nrence. It has been partly described how the TME hyaluronan (HA) \nregulates CSCs function. We have demonstrated that 4-Methylum -\nbelliferone (4Mu), a modulator of HA synthesis, reduces CSCs prop -\nerties in hepatocarcinoma. Here, we observed that HA was present \non mice Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) tumors. We found HA+ LLC \ncells; thus cancer cells produced, at least in part, the HA observed \nin tumors. We observed about 6.58 \u00b1 0.83 % of CD133+ CSCs on \nin vitro  cultured LLC cells. Isolated CD133+ cells showed higher ex -\npression of HA and CD44 in comparison with non-CSCs population \n(p<0.05). Analysis of HA synthases (HAS), hyaluronidases (HYAL) \nand the CSCs transcription factors KLF4 and SOX2 expression from \nNSCLC patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas data showed that \nwhile HAS3 positively correlates with levels of KLF4 and SOX2, \nHYAL2 inversely correlates with SOX2 expression. Also, HAS3 \ncorrelates with a shorter disease-free survival when it is highly ex -\npressed. Also, 4Mu treatment of whole, CD133+ or CD133- LLC cells \nshowed an inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) of 0.90mM, 0.60mM \nand 1.06mM respectively, while non tumor cells showed an IC50 of \n4.22mM (p<0.01). When CD133+ cells were treated with 4Mu plus \nchemotherapy we observed a significant decrease in viability with an \nIC50 of 0.32nM pemetrexed (Pe) vs. 0.15nM Pe+4M, and 7.52nM \npaclitaxel (Pa) vs. 0.50nM Pa + 4Mu. Our results suggest that tar -\ngeting HA could turn tumors, particularly CSCs, more susceptible to \nchemotherapy promoting an effective antitumoral response. \nREPRODUCCI\u00d3N\n315.

Vitality, \nmotility and ROS concentration data were analysed by ANOVA or \nKruskal-Wallis in the case the assumptions were not met by ANO -\nVA. Mitochondrial and DNA integrity data were analysed by linear \nmixed models for longitudinal data. The percentage of motile sperm \nwas higher in doses supplemented with 1 and 2 mM ZnCl2 by day 2 \n(63.25a C vs 68.5a 0.5 mM vs 73.75b 1 mM vs 71.5b 2 mM vs 65.5c \n3 mM de ZnCl2, p=0.082) while, by day 3 all doses supplemented \nwith Zn showed higher percentage of motile sperm than the control \n(47.75a C vs 61b 0.5 mM vs 65.75b 1 mM vs 60.50b 2 mM vs 61.50b \n3 mM ZnCl2, p=0.0184). CASA analysis demonstrated differences \nin the linear pattern of movement and percentage of rapid sperm. \nMitochondrial integrity was affected only by the time of storage while \nvitality, ROS concentration and DNA integrity did not show changes \nneither by treatment nor time of the experiment. The results indicate \nthat Zn preserves motility of sperm storage at low temperature al -\nlowing its use for AI.\n316.

Ser -\ntoli cells (SCs) are necessary in order to provide the structural and \nnutritional support for germ cell development. SCs convert     glu -\ncose to lactate, the main energy substrate for spermatogenic cells. \nConsequently, SCs cannot rely on glucose for their own energy re -\nquirements and it has been postulated that they utilize fatty acids \n(FA) as energy source. In addition, FA are stored as triglycerides \n(TAG) in lipid droplets (LD), being the latter essential to keep ATP \nlevels in SCs. On the other hand, according to the World Health \nOrganization, obesity prevalence has risen dramatically and has \nbeen shown to negatively affect male reproductive function through \nmultiple mechanisms. Adipocytes, the main cell type within adipose \ntissue, secrete Leptin (Lep) and its secretion is increased in obesity. \nTherefore, the analysis of Lep effects on SC function might explain \nsome mechanisms related to subfertility associated with obesity. \nConsidering that the regulation of FA storage may be relevant to \nseminiferous tubule physiology, the aim of this work was to study the \neffect of Lep on TAG storage in SCs. Cultures of SCs from 20-day \nold rats were maintained under basal conditions (B) or stimulated \nwith concentrations of Lep observed in non-obese (10ng/ml) and \nobese (100 ng/ml) patients for 48 h. It was observed that both con -\nditions augment the LD number (B: 0.67\u00b10.17; Lep 10: 1.67 \u00b1 0.41*; \nLep 100: 2.9\u00b11.0*. X\u00b1SD, LD/cell in one representative experiment \nout of three. *P < 0.05 vs B). This change was accompanied by an \nincrease in TAG content and in mRNA levels of PLIN1, protein that \ncoats LD. The results presented herein suggest that Lep regulates \nlipid storage in SCs. Considering that the FA are the main energy \nsource of SCs, Lep would play an important role in the lipid homeo -\nstasis of this cell type (PICT2015-228; PICT2018-1291; PIP2015-\n0127).\n317.

The BTB isolates germ cells (GC) provi -\nding an adequate microenvironment for GC development. Concor -\ndantly, several animal models have shown that defects in the BTB \nlead to detrimental effects on spermatogenesis. Metformin (Met) is \nthe first-line therapy for children suffering type 2 diabetes. However, \nno studies have been conducted to assess if early life exposure to \nMet represents any potential risk to BTB function. The objective of \nthis work was to analyze the in vitro  and in vivo  effects of Met on \nBTB integrity and expression of BTB-related proteins during BTB \nformation. SC isolated from 20-day-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats \nwere incubated in basal conditions or with testosterone (T, 1 \u00b5M) (a \nknown positive BTB regulator) in the absence or presence of Met \n10 mM. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The BTB \njunctional integrity was measured as Transepithelial Electrical Re -\nsistance (TER). Met decreased T-stimulated TER (B:60.2\u00b15.4, Met: \n64.0\u00b13.3; T:120.0\u00b17.1*; T+Met: 92.4\u00b16.5# \u03a9.cm2, * vs B; # vs T). This \nreduction was accompanied by a decrease in mRNA levels of clau -\ndin 11, occludin, ZO-1 and Cx-43. For in vivo  assays, male SD rats \nreceived a daily oral dose of Met (200 mg/kg) while controls (C) \nreceived vehicle (water) from postnatal day (PND) 14 to PND 30, \nperiod in which BTB is being established. On PND 31, BTB integri -\nty was evaluated using a biotinylated tracer. Gene expression and \nmeiosis progression analyses were also performed. Met treatment \nled to a mild but significant increase in the percentage of permea -\nted tubules (C:14.5\u00b11.5%; Met:18.8\u00b10.9%*) although no changes in \nBTB-related gene expression or meiosis progression were obser -\nved. Overall, Met disturbed in vitro  BTB parameters and exerted a \nslight increase in BTB permeability in juvenile rats. (PICT2015-228)\n318.

Placental metabolic alterations \nwere reported in pregnancy complications and impairment of mTOR \nactivity was observed in placentas with fetal growth restriction. Va -\nsoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) has embryotrophic effects. We \nhave recently shown its modulatory effect on Tb metabolism and \nwe described a murine pregnancy model with VIP-deficient Tb cells \npresenting impaired placentation and reduced fetal weight at ges -\ntational day (gd) 14.5/17.5. VIP treatment at gd6.5 restored fetal \nweight. Our aim was to evaluate in vivo  placental glucose uptake \nand transfer to the fetus in this model and the effect of VIP treat -\nment on placental metabolism. We mated VIP+/+ females with \nVIP+/+ or VIP-/- males. For VIP treatment 2 nmol VIP were inject -\ned at gd6.5. At gd17.5 females were intraperitoneally injected with \n3mM glucose fluorescent analogue 2-NBDG for 1.5h. Fluorescence \nof fetal/placental tissue was quantified in a fluorimeter. Placental/\nfetal GLUT1/mTOR expression was measured by RT-qPCR. For ex \nvivo experiments, VIP+/+ placental explants were incubated with \nVIP antagonist prior to the in vitro  addition of 2-NBDG. We found \nthat VIP antagonist impaired glucose uptake in placental explants \n(p<0.05) from WT mice. VIP+/- placental weight at gd17.5 did not \ndiffer from VIP+/+ placentas. Surprisingly, in vivo  assays showed \nan increase of glucose uptake by VIP+/- placentas (0.57\u00b10.11 nmol/MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

VIP treatment tended to re -\nstore mTOR/GLUT1 expression. These results suggest that while \nVIP regulates at the cellular level Tb glucose uptake, VIP deficiency  \nin vivo  triggers compensatory mechanisms at both the placental and \nfetal tissues that would contribute to placental metabolic adaptations \nin order to restore fetal growth.\n319.

SC metabolism has particular characteristics. It con -\nverts glucose to lactate, the main energy substrate for GC, and uses \nfatty acids (FA) as its own energy source. SC is also capable of \nsynthesizing triglycerides and storing them in lipid droplets (LD). In \nthis context, the simultaneous regulation of lipid metabolism and \nlactate production may be relevant to the seminiferous tubule phys -\niology. Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) belong to a NAD+-dependent enzymes \nfamily that act as cellular energy sensors. SIRT1, the most stud -\nied member, plays an important role in processes ranging from cell \ncycle regulation to energy homeostasis. The aim of this work was \nto evaluate the participation of SIRT1 in the regulation of lactate \nproduction and of FA metabolism in SCs. SC cultures obtained from \n20-day-old rats were incubated in the absence (B) or presence of \nresveratrol 50 \u00b5M (RSV, SIRT1 activator). Results are expressed \nas X\u00b1SD of three independent experiments (*p<0.05). It was ob -\nserved that RSV increases lactate production (B: 3.62\u00b10.73; RSV: \n5.24\u00b10.76*\u00b5g/\u00b5g DNA) and glucose consumption (B: 21.34\u00b15.21; \nRSV: 40.14\u00b15.71*\u00b5g/\u00b5g DNA). Possible mechanisms involved in the \nincrease of lactate production after SIRT1 activation were evaluat -\ned and it was observed that treatment with RSV augments GLUT1 \nmRNA levels (1.86\u00b10.44* fold variation respect to B). Regarding FA \nmetabolism, RSV treatment decreases LD content (B: 0.52\u00b10.06; \nRSV: 0.13\u00b10.02* LD/cell) and increases the expression of FA trans -\nporter FAT/CD36 (2.01\u00b10.47* fold variation respect to B). In addi -\ntion, RSV increases Acetyl CoA Carboxylase phosphorylation levels, \nwhich is related to active FA oxidation. Taken together, these results \nsuggest that SIRT1 activation would play an important role in the \nregulation of SC glucose and lipid metabolism, essential for a nor -\nmal spermatogenesis (PICT2014-0945; PIP2015-0127).\n320. (77) DISRUPTION IN THE SPERM QUALITY OF THE OFF -\nSPRING CAUSED BY MATERNAL OVERNUTRITION IN \nRATS\nMeneghini MA, Flores Quiroga JP, Cortez AE, Faletti AG\nCentro de Estudios Farmacol\u00f3gicos y Bot\u00e1nicos (CEFY -\nBO-CONICET), Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Bue -\nnos Aires.\nObesity has increased in recent years and is the most important \nnoncommunicable chronic disease. Maternal overnutrition may in -\nduce multiple pathologies in both women and their offspring. Our \nprevious studies showed that male offspring from high-fat-fed rats \nexhibited higher body and testis weight and altered puberty. Also, \nwe found a lower number of germ cells, percentage of motile sperm \nand capacitation. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate \nthe effects of maternal overnutrition, induced by high-fat diet, on the \nquality and function of sperm in the offspring.To this end, maternal \novernutrition were induced by a high-fat palatable (cafeteria) diet, \nwhich was supplied continuously until weaning of their offspring, in -\ncluding pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring from rats fed stan -\ndard (OSD) or cafeteria diet (OCD) were fed with a standard diet, in -\nspected periodically, and euthanized at 60 days of age. In the germ \ncells we examined the presence of the reactive oxygen species by flow cytometry using a fluorescent probe (2,7-dichlorofluorescein di -\nacetate), DNA fragmentation by TUNEL kit, mitochondrial function \nusing the probe 3.3-diaminobenzidine, the membrane functional \nstatus by hypoosmotic swelling test, and the presence of abnormal \nchromosomes by cytogenetic assay (Evan test). Compared with \nOSD rats, OCD group showed a lower percentage of the hypoos -\nmotic-reacted sperm (15 \u00b11 vs 23 \u00b12, p<0.01) and an increase in the \nabnormal metaphases (6 \u00b11 vs 2.1 \u00b10.7, p<0.001). No differences \nwere found in the TUNEL positive cells, but OCD exhibited higher \nfluorescein intensity expressed as relative units (577 \u00b174, p<0.01) \ncompared with OSD (233 \u00b127). Finally, 50% of OCD rats displayed \na lower mitochondrial function, expressed as relative units (94.8 \u00b14 \nvs 97.7 \u00b10.4 from OSD, p<0.01).These results indicate that diet-in -\nduced maternal overnutrition may contribute to disorders in the fetal \nprogramming, particularly in the germ cell quality.\n321.

E-mail: sanchezbelen564@gmail.com\nHyperthyroidism (H) reduced milk ejection and quality, impairing \nmaternal behavior and mammary gland development. However, it \nremains unclear if H impacts in milk immune cells numbers. Our aim \nis to assess the influence of H on i) pup maturation and development \nii) prolactin secretion and iii) milk immune cells. For this purpose, \n10-12 weeks old Wistar  rats were injected daily with T4 (0.25 mg/\nkg until day 18 of gestation, then 0.1 mg/kg until day 2 of lactation \nL2) to induce H or with vehicle in control group. Rats were mated 8 \ndays after starting T4 treatment and euthanized L2 (after ketamine/\nxylazine sedation and oxytocin stimulation for milking). Afterwards, \nmilk and mammary gland samples, minced to reach single cell sus -\npension, were dyed with fluorophore labeled mAbs (CD45+, CD3+, \nCD11b/c+) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Offspring weights on L1 \nand 2, head circumference and body length (L2) were measured. \nSerum of dams and offspring was obtained to determine total T4 and \nprolactin levels by RIA. Our results show that H mothers had more \nimplantation sites and pup number ( p<0,05 ) and higher pup mor -\ntality rate than controls ( p<0,001 ). The H pups had lower weight on \ndays 1 and 2 ( p<0,001 ), less weight gain, and diminished length and \nhead circumference ( p<0,001 ). H group T4 and prolactin levels were \nincreased in dams ( p<0,01; p<0,001 ) but T4 reduced in the pups \n(p<0,001 ). The H group had increased % of CD45+ cells ( p<0,05)  \nand % and absolute quantity of CD3+ cells/\u00b5l compared with control \nwhile the number of CD11 b/c+ cells was diminished ( p<0,05 ). No \nchanges were observed in mammary gland resident immune cells. \nThese results suggest that T4 impairs pup development on early \nlactation. Additionally, milk leukocytes are modulated by H with a \ncell-lineage specific response. These data suggest that then mater -\nnal immune protection transferred through milk to the offspring may \nbe altered in H and highlight the need of evaluating thyroid status in \npregnancy and lactation.\n\u00c1rea tem\u00e1tica: Reproducci\u00f3n.\n322.

Endocervical swabs from 103 as -\nymptomatic pregnant women with gestational age of 12 to 30 weeks \nfrom the National Hospital Posadas were enrolled. Swab samples \nwere enriched in Tryptic Soy Broth and then streaked on sorbi -\ntol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar. E. coli  was confirmed by the presence \nof uidA gene detected by polymerase chain reaction PCR. The pos -\nitive samples for E. coli  were analyzed for STEC virulence factors \ngenes such as: stx1, stx2, eae, rfbO157, lpfAO113 and hcpA genes . The \nstx2 positive E. coli  samples were grown in Luria-Bertani Broth and \nthe filter-sterilized bacterial supernatants (SN) were used to evaluate \nStx2 activity on Vero, Swan and Hela by cell viability assay. Our re -\nsults  showed that 14.6% (15/103) of the endocervical samples were \npositive for uidA gene. Additionally, we found that 8.7% (9/103) was \npositive for stx2 and 5.8 % (6/103) for lpfAO113 and hcpA  genes. The \nSN of one of them expressing stx2 gene had a high cytotoxic activity \non Vero, Swan 71 and HeLa cells. Stx2 identity was checked using \nan anti-Stx2 antibody in order to neutralize the cytotoxic effects. In \nconclusion , we demonstrate that STEC can be asymptomatically \npresent in the endocervix and that can potentially express Stx2. This \nstudy may open a new perspective to understand whether STEC \ncan be a novel pathogen involved in adverse pregnancy outcomes.\n323. (197) OVARIAN PROTEOME OF VIZCACHAS (LAGOSTO -\nMUS MAXIMUS, CAVIOMORPHA, RODENTIA) IS MODU -\nLATED BY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\nKevin Feehan, Santiago Andr\u00e9s Cortasa, Alejandro Ra\u00fal \nSchmidt, Alfredo Daniel Vitullo, Veronica Berta Dorfman, Ju -\nlia Halperin \nCEBBAD, Universidad Maimonides\nProteome is the complete set of proteins expressed by an organism, \nand it actively changes in response to both internal and external \nconditions. Since estradiol levels of pregnant vizcachas strongly \ncorrelate with climate variables we aimed to study the effect of such \nvariables on the ovarian proteome. For this, ovarian protein extracts \nfrom two groups of pregnant females (n=2 each group) with 105\u00b16 \ndays of gestation were used for proteomic analysis. The years of \ncapture of each group, 2011 and 2015, were characterized by low \ntemperature/high precipitation and high temperature/low precipita -\ntion levels respectively. Briefly, equal amounts of protein extracts \nwere analyzed using MALDI-TOF/MS and then, LC-ESI/MS (Or -\nbitrap). The resulting peptides were identified with Proteome Discov -\nerer Software using the Rodentia UniProt Database, and functional \nenrichment analysis was performed using DAVID, STRING and Fun -\nRich softwares. Proteins differentially expressed in each year were \nplotted on a volcano plot (t-test, p <0.05). Through functional en -\nrichment analysis it was corroborated that apoptosis regulation and \nplatelet degranulation processes prevailed in 2011-ovaries, while in \nthe 2015-ovaries signal transduction was favored. In addition, the \ninteractomes defined by the overexpressed proteins showed a very \ndistinct topography in 2011 vs 2015, with different nodal peptides in \neach situation. This is the first large-scale data analysis of the viz -\ncacha proteome. The present work showed an ovarian expression \nprofile that significantly varies under different climatic conditions. Fi -\nnally, this work provides new markers for future investigations on the \nmodulation of ovarian function. Grants: Fundaci\u00f3n CIent\u00edfica Felipe \nFiorellino; PIP (CONICET)110/14\n324.

Resver -\natrol (RES) is a natural polyphenol with well-known anticarcinogenic \nproperties found abundantly in grapes, peanuts, and berries.  We \nand others have shown its inhibitory effect on EDT development but \nits molecular mechanism is still unknown. The aim of this study was \nto evaluate the effect of RES (50-100\u00b5M) on the proliferation, mi -\ngration and apoptosis of endometriotic epithelial cell line 12Z and \nendometrial stromal cell line St-T1b. We also studied its effect on \ngene expression related to cell migration and angiogenesis, and on \nthe maintenance of stem cell pluripotency in both cell lines and in \nprimary endometrial epithelial cell cultures (EEC). RES significantly \ndecreased cell viability after 48h in both concentrations and both \ncell lines (p<0.01), and reduced wound healing size after 8h and \n20h with 100\u00b5M and 50 \u00b5M RES respectively (p<0.05). The number \nof apoptotic cells, assessed by FITC Annexin V/PI, was increased \nafter 24h (p<0.01) as well as cleaved caspase-3 levels, assessed by \nWestern Blot (p<0.05). On the other hand, real time PCR showed \nthat treatment with 100\u00b5M RES reduced MMP2 and increased \nTimp1 mRNA expression in both cell lines (p<0.05). Angiotensin1 \nmRNA levels decreased with both RES doses (p<0.05). Besides, \n100\u00b5M RES decreased VEGF mRNA levels only in St-T1b (p<0.05). \nEEC treated with 100\u00b5M RES displayed an increase of Timp1 and a \ndecrease of MMP2, VEGF and Angiotensin1 mRNA levels (p<0.05). \nAmong the stem cell pluripotency markers, 100\u00b5M RES provoked \nan increase in Notch1, Snail1, KLF4, Sox2 and Tert mRNA levels \nin both cell lines and in EEC (p<0.05). Also, the expression of Oct4 \nmRNA increased in St-T1b and EEC (p<0.05) and Vimentin mRNA \nexerted a significant upregulation only in EEC (p<0.01). These find -\nings revealed that RES treatment affects several signaling events \nimplicated in EDT development and progression.\n325.

It regulates tropho -\nblast survival and fetal maternal tolerance by the induction of HLA-G \nin placental cells. The expression of leptin in trophoblastic cells is \nregulated by different endogenous signals. Previous results from our \nlab demonstrated that estradiol (E2) regulates leptin expression. In \nthis study we aimed to characterize glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and \nanalyze the effect of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone \n(DEX) on leptin expression in human placental cells. BeWo cells \ncultured under standard conditions, and human placental explants \nwere used as well. Western blot immunofluorescence and transient \ntransfection analysis were carried out. We analyze (GR) expression \nin placental explants. Two isoforms of 67 and 56 KDa were char -\nacterized and the smaller one was increased after E2 treatment. \nNeither of them was induced by 100 nM DEX. Besides the incu -\nbation with 100 nM DEX significantly diminished leptin expression \nregardless the presence of E2. Endogenous GR was not able to be \ndetected in BeWo cells. However, overexpression of a recombinant \nGR-GFP protein in BeWo cells localized in the nucleus and activated MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020142\nMMTV promoter dependent luc transcription after DEX stimulation. \nThese results demonstrated that GR pathway is active in these cells.\nIn conclusion GR protein is expressed in placental cells as 67 and \n56 KDa isoforms and probably mediates the regulation of leptin ex -\npression by DEX.\n326.

The aim of this study was \nto evaluate whether PCOS alters the expression of molecules in -\nvolved in functional differentiation of the rat uterus. To induce PCOS, \nWistar rats were injected subcutaneously with dehydroepiandroste -\nrone (6mg/100g body weight, PCOS group) from postnatal day 21 \n(PND21) to PND40, control group receive sesame oil. At PND41, \nthe uterine horns were collected. Molecules involved in cell growth \nand proliferation [ie: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF-1 re -\nceptor (IGF-1R), Homeobox gene A10 (Hoxa10), phosphatidyli -\nnositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase (PTEN)] and involved in \nuterine development and differentiation [ie: Wingless-related MMTV \nintegration site member 5a and 7a (Wnt5a and Wn7a) and \u03b2-cat -\nenin] were evaluated by RT-PCR and/or immunohistochemistry. In \nPCOS rats, IGF-1 mRNA was increased whereas IGF-1R mRNA \nwas similar to Control rats. Hoxa10 mRNA expression was similar \nbetween experimental groups whereas the expression of the tumor \nsuppressor gene, PTEN, was decreased both in subepithelial stro -\nma and in myometrium of PCOS rats. In these rats, Wnt7a mRNA \nwas not modified but a decrease of Wnt5a (mRNA and protein) and \nan increase of \u03b2-catenin (mRNA and protein) was observed. Wnt5a \nwas expressed in all uterine compartments whereas \u03b2-catenin was \nmarkedly expressed in the cell membrane of epithelial cells. The \nresults suggest that increased IGF-1 and decreased PTEN could \nbe responsible for dysregulation of uterine cell proliferation in PCOS \nrats. Furthermore, the decrease in Wnt5a and the increase in \u03b2-cat -\nenin in the cell membrane suggest a down-regulation of mechanism \nregulated by canonical Wnt signaling. These changes may help ex -\nplain the uterine abnormalities observed in women with PCOS. \n327.

The aim of this study was to develop and characterize an \noptimal experimental in vivo model for MS with the future objective \nof studying the effect of MS on endometrial physiology and repro -\nductive disorders. Twenty one-days-old female C57BL/6 mice were \ndivided in two groups: one received a high fat diet (HF) and the other \none, a control diet (CD) for 13 or 14 weeks. Animals were weighed \nweekly and a significant increase in weight of HF mice was observed \nat week 11 (p \u02c20,05). On the last day of experiment, glycemia  was measured using a glucometer with One Touch test strips at two fast -\ning times: 4 h and 6 h, observing a significant increase in HF group \nafter the longer fast (p\u02c2 0,01).  Animals were sacrificed at estrus and \nthe blood was collected by cardiac puncture for biochemical analy -\nses of cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL. The uterine horns, \nthe adipose tissue and the liver were removed and fixed. Significant \nchanges in cholesterol, LDL and HDL were observed in HF mice \n(p\u02c20,05), but no changes were found in triglycerides levels. Adipose \ntissues were weighed, seeing a significant increase in the weight of \nvisceral and gonadal adipose tissue in HF mice ( p\u02c20,05). Steatosis \nwas evaluated by hematoxylin eosin ( H-E) staining in liver sections, \nobserving a fatty liver in the HF group. As an approximation to study \nthe reproductive profile, cell proliferation, was assessed by PCNA \nimmunohistochemistry and endometrial glands and leukocytes were \ncount in H-E stained uterine sections in a preliminary experiment, \nbut no changes were observed between groups. These results are \npromising for the further efforts to evaluate the effect of MS on fe -\nmale reproduction.\n328.

Moreover, leptin prevents cellular stress under \nhypoxic condition in trophoblastic cells. In this sense, Leptin is in -\ncremented in different pregnancy pathologies such as preeclamp -\nsia. In this work we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in \nLeptin antiapoptotic effect on placental apoptosis induced by cobalt \nchloride (CoCl2). This agent stabilizes HIF-1\u03b1 transcription factor. \nWe used Swan-71 cells, a cytotrophoblast human cell line and hu -\nman term placental explants cultured under normoxia and hypoxia \nconditions. Swan-71 cells and placental explants were treated with \nCoCl2 (50 or 100 \u00b5M) in presence or absence of leptin (100 ng/ml). \nThe expression of HIF-1\u03b1, p53, Caspase-3, cPARP and Mdm2 was \ndetermined by Western blot. Apoptosis was determined by the visu -\nalization of apoptotic nuclei by IF. All procedures were approved by \nethical review committee at the Alejandro Posadas National Hos -\npital. \nWe observed that HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization increased apoptosis (1.54 \n\u00b10.1) in Swan-71 cells. Treatment with CoCl2 increased (1.8 \u00b1 0.5) \nPARP-1 and (1.7 \u00b1 0.2) \nCaspase-3 levels indicating that apoptosis was induced. Leptin \ntreatment diminished this effect (p<0.01). Leptin was capable to reg -\nulate p53 pathway, increasing Mdm2 (1.4 \u00b1 0.4) expression, a p53 \nnegative regulator in hypoxia condition. All these results suggest \nthat HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization enhances placental apoptosis and leptin is \ncapable to protect these cells under hypoxic conditions. \nKey words:  Placenta, apoptosis, hypoxia, leptin\n329.

The animals \nwere weighed once a week . Estrus cycle was evaluated by vaginal \ncytology and glycemia was measured. After the sacrifice, serum, go -\nnadal and visceral fat and the ovaries were extracted to measure \nmetabolic parameters and to perform histochemical and western \nblot analysis. Unpaired t-test was used. \nResults: the animals fed with a HFD had higher body weight, gly -\ncemia, total cholesterol (Cho), HDL-Cho and LDL-Cho. Their ad -\nipocytes were hypertrophied and the animals showed increased \ngonadal and visceral adipose tissue. The estrus cycle was shorter in \nHFD-fed animals compared to controls. The number of cycles was \nincreased in the HFD group.  However, anovulatory stages were \nlonger in HFD animals. In the ovary, periendothelial cell area and \ncellular proliferation were increased, while the percentage of corpo -\nra lutea was decreased. In addition, PDGFB was decreased in the \novaries of HFD-fed animals.\nConclusion: HFD feeding affects metabolism and ovarian function, \nleading to an alteration in the estrous cycle and a decrease in ovu -\nlation. Changes in cellular proliferation, periendothelial cell area and \nPDGFB may be some of the possible causes of the observed alter -\nations.\nKEY WORDS : High fat diet, ovary, angiogenesis, metabolism\n330.

In earlier stages after \nimplantation, this local inflammatory immune response produces \nan anti-inflammatory response, that includes numerous cytokines \nthat regulate the intrauterine and systemic environment. This study \naimed to evaluate the profile expression of IL-6 during porcine ges -\ntation. Swine placentas and sera were collected at 32, 44, 50, 60, \n70, 80, 90, 114 days of gestation (dg) from slaughterhouses near \nGeneral Pico, La Pampa, Argentina. Animals were sacrificed ac -\ncording to the animal welfare manual of National Agrifood Health \nand Quality Service (SENASA). The placentas were separated in \nfetal and maternal portions to obtain homogenates of the fetal pla -\ncenta (HoFP) and maternal placenta (HoMP). As a control, we pre -\npared homogenates from non-pregnant uteri (HoU). IL-6 concentra -\ntion was determined by a specific porcine ELISA kit (R&D Systems, \nUSA). In this first approach of this study, it was observed that this cy -\ntokine is elevated at 32 dg in HoFP (878.29 pg/ml). Around 32 days \nof gestation begins the ossification of the embryos and the stage of \nthe exponential growth of the placenta. After this peak, its concen -\ntration decreased reaching basal values (below 37 pg/ml), which are \nsimilar concentrations than that determined in HoU (34 pg/ml). On \nthe other hand, analyzing the results in HoMP, we found a markedly \nincreasing of IL-6 at 50-80 dg: 50 (48.4 pg/ml), 60 (126.74 pg/ml), \n70 (66 pg/ml), and 80 dg (87 pg/ml). In this period occurs the end of \nplacental development and the beginning of the exponential growth \nof fetuses. Finally, we found a pattern of two biphasic curves of IL-6 \nexpression. The first corresponds between 44-50 dg and the sec -\nond correspond to the 70-90 dg, reaching a maximum value at 90 \n(384.85 pg/ml). Interestingly, we observed a basal value in serum at \n60 dg which is the same period in that we found the maximum value \nfor IL-6 in HoMP. As a preliminary conclusion, the variability of the \nIL-6 expression observed, suggest that this cytokine could be nec -\nessary in the molecular events that occur at placental remodeling \nduring gestation.\n331.

Peripheral blood neutrophils (Neu) and mononuclear cells \n(PBMCs) were purified from healthy donors and cultured with condi -\ntioned media from trophoblast cells (TbCM) treated or not with LPS \n(PgLPS-CM) or LPS ultrapure (PgLPSultra-CM). Apoptosis and \nreactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by flow cytometry. \nRegulatory T cell induction was evaluated by flow cytometry.\nPg-LPS ultrapure increasde the expression of TNFa, IL6 and IL1b \nrespect to basal while Pg-LPS had no effect. In line with this result, \nPg-LPS-CM had no effect on neutrophil activation whereas PgLP -\nSultra-CM increased neutrophil activation with higher release of \nROS and decreased apoptosis rate (p\u22640.05). Neutrophils exposed \nto TbCM induced FOXP3 expression on CD4+ T cell after 48h of co -\nculture with PBMCs. This induction was diminished when neutrophil \nwere preconditioned with PgLPS-CM or PgLPSultra-CM (P<0,05).\nThe inflammatory effects of TLR4-dependent Pg-LPS on the tropho -\nblast-neutrophil interaction could contribute to the pathogenic mech -\nanisms of Pg infection in early pregnancy.\n332.

These processes \nare directed by miRNAs that regulate the expression or stability of \ntheir transcription factors. Here we focus on the role of ERS/UPR \nduring decidualization to induce a physiological sterile inflammatory \nresponse and whether it might be regulate by miRNAs. We used \nan in vitro model  of decidualization represented by human telomer -\nase-immortalized endometrial stromal cell line St-T1b, treated with \n8-Br-cAMP (0.5 mM) during 5 days, or Thapsigargin (Tg, a RS-in -\nducer 1 \u00b5g/ml);  and endometrial biopsies from patients with recur -\nrent spontaneous abortions (RSA) and recurrent in vitro  fertilization \nfailures (RIF).\nWe evaluated the expression of the ERS-sensor ATF6 and the UPR \nmarker, CHOP. Both markers increased in decidualized cells, and \nTg induced even higher levels in comparison with non-decidualized \ncells (p<0.05, t-test). Then, we evaluated the modulation of TXNIP, a \nlink between the ERS-pathway and inflammation. TXNIP increased MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

Then, using an in silico  analysis using \nmiRTarBase v8.0  we selected two miRNAs able to regulate the ERS \nand UPR pathways: miR-193b-3p and miR-21-5p. Both miRNAs sig -\nnificantly decreased in non-decidualized cells in the presence of Tg \n(p<0.05, t-test). Finally, we studied the expression and localization \nof miRNAs through an  In Situ  Hybridization (ISH) technique in en -\ndometrial samples. Both miRNAs were expressed in stromal cells \nand endometrial glands in samples from RSA and RIF patients at \nsimilar levels. The present results suggest that decidualization in \nSt-T1b cells is accompanied by an ERS and UPR associated with a \nsterile inflammatory response potentially regulated by miR-193b-3p \nand miR-21-5p.\n333.

Female Wistar rats were \nfed with control (CON) diet (pellets) or CAF diet (i.e.: cheese snacks, \nsweet biscuits, and chocolate) from weaning. After 14th week of \nfeeding, females were mated and half of the animals of each group \nwere euthanized at E21. We determined fetal weight and length, and \nplacental weight and index (placental weight/fetal weight ratio). The \nrest of the animals were maintained until delivery with the respective \ndiet to assess the weight of pups at birth. Placentas were collected \nfor mRNA quantification of IGF1, IGF1R, IGF2, IGF2R, VEGF and \nVEGFR and for DNA methylation analysis of their promoter regions. \nFeto-placental parameters were analyzed using Student\u00b4s T test; \nfor mRNA expression and DNA methylation levels a Mann-Whitney \nU test was performed. CAF diet produced a decrease of placental \nweight and index on E21 and a low weight of pups at birth. In addi -\ntion, we found an upregulation of IGF2 and down regulation of VEGF \nplacental mRNA expression in CAF dams. Importantly, these chang -\nes were associated with modifications in DNA methylation levels of \ntheir respective promoter regions. These results indicate that mater -\nnal CAF diet impairment of placental growth and pups weight at birth \ncould be explained, at least in part, with an epigenetic disruption \nof IGF and VEGF systems. Identifying how epigenetic targets are \ndysregulated by diet factors will allow the development of prevention \nstrategies to improve human and animal reproductive health.\nTOXICOLOG\u00cdA\n334.

Increasing \napplications are the AgNP-based wound dressing, providing a large \nsurface area with high bactericidal efficacy. We aimed to design a \nfilm of hydrogel, composed of autochthonous and low cost poly -\nmers. Within the film, oil-in-water emulsions will be used to encap -\nsulate and delivery AgNPs, vitamins, anesthetic, and anti-inflamma -\ntories. This novel device for the treatment of wounds and burns will \nbe enriched with supplements focused in the reduction of pain and \nin the acceleration of healing process. As a first step, we will carry \nout an analysis of efficacy of the AgNPs in opportunistic bacterias \ncommonly found on the skin, and toxicology of the AgNPs in zebraf -\nish embryo and larvae. Results will help to select a concentration \nto next use in the emulsion. To evaluate effectiveness of AgNPs, \nStaphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were incu -\nbated with 1.6-60 ppm AgNPs, and minimal inhibitory concentration \n(MIC) was determined. To evaluate toxicology of AgNPs, Zebrafish \nembryo and larvae were incubated with 0.1-100 ppm AgNPs, then \nstudies of LC50, acute toxicity (mortality), teratogenicity (hatching \nrate and morphology), general developmental abnormalities and \nspecific tissue toxicity (brain and heart function) were conducted. \nThe bacterial inhibition indicated a high susceptibility of Staphylo -\ncoccus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 30 ppm. It was \nobserved that AgNPs, in the highest concentrations, caused a delay \nin the development of embryos, morphological abnormalities in the \nlarvae, decreased swimming and heart rate. In the larval lethality \nstudy, it was observed that the LC50 at 1 hs post-incubation was 683 \nppm, and at 48 hs post-incubation, it was 108 ppm. The comparison \nof in vitro and in vivo results allows us to find a functional and harm -\nless AgNPs dose.\n335.

Since the male rat mammary gland is susceptible to \nendocrine disruption, it is a useful model to study the effects of these \ncompounds. Here, we evaluated whether developmental exposure \nto glyphosate (GLY), propiconazole (PRO) or both (PROGLY) al -\nter the mammary gland morphology and its endocrine response in \npostpubertal male rats. Pregnant rats were exposed orally to vehicle \n(saline solution), 4 mg/kg/day of GLY, 4 mg/kg/day of PRO or both \ndoses of GLY and PRO, from gestation day 9 until weaning. On post -\nnatal day 60, the male offspring were sacrificed and mammary gland \nsamples were collected. Total area, perimeter, longitudinal growth, \nnumber of terminal end buds and mammary development score \nwere analyzed in mammary gland whole-mounts (WMs). Lobuloal -\nveolar development and the presence of hyperplastic structures \nwere evaluated in histological sections, as well as estrogen (ESR1) \nand androgen receptor (AR) protein expression. Among the param -\neters evaluated in WM, only mammary gland total area was reduced \nin GLY exposed males (Control: 492\u00b116 mm2, GLY: 419\u00b121 mm2, \nPRO: 436\u00b117 mm2, PROGLY: 473\u00b119 mm2; Control vs GLY p<0.05). \nRegarding mammary gland morphology, PRO animals presented \nan enhance lobuloalveolar development (p<0.05) and 27% of the \nanimals developed lobular hyperplasias, whereas no differences \nwere observed in the percentage of hyperplastic ducts between ex -\nperimental groups (p>0.05). The protein expression of ESR1 was \nlower in GLY males (Control: 15.3\u00b10.72%, GLY: 11.0\u00b10.74%, PRO: \n15.5\u00b11.4, PROGLY: 12.6\u00b11.0%; Control vs GLY p<0.05) and AR \nexpression was similar between experimental groups (p>0.05). In \nconclusion, GLY and PRO have different effects in mammary gland \ndevelopment; however, these effects are not observed when the ABSTRACTS145\nmales are exposed to both compounds.       \n336.

Our aim was to evaluate whether \nin utero  exposure to BP3 alters mammary gland (MG) development \nduring puberty. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were dermally exposed to \nvehicle (sesame oil; Control), 0.15 (0.15B) or 50mg BP3/kg/day \n(50B) from gestation day 8.5 to 18. Gestational parameters such \nas the length of gestation, the weight gain of dams and the num -\nber of pups per litter were recorded. Also, the offspring body weight \n(BW) gain during lactation was evaluated. After weaning, the onset \nof puberty in females was recorded as the day of vaginal opening. \nMG samples were obtained in diestrus on postnatal day 45. Total \nand epithelial area, perimeter, longitudinal growth, branching and \nnumber of terminal end buds (TEBs) were measured in MG whole-\nmounts (WMs), whereas MG morphology was analyzed in histo -\nlogical sections. The expression of Ki-67, estrogen receptor and \nprogesterone receptor (PR) was evaluated by immunohistochem -\nistry. The gestational parameters in the dams, as well as the BW \ngain and the onset of puberty in the female offspring were similar \nbetween groups. Histo-morphological analysis showed similar MG \ngrowth between groups, with ducts extending beyond the lymph \nnode, ductal-side branching and TEBs. The proliferation index (Ki-\n67) and the expression of steroid hormone receptors were similar in \nall groups. However, in animals exposed to BP3, PR-positive cells \nwere observed in clusters in MG ducts, suggesting future branching \npoints. Although in utero  exposure to BP3 induces limited changes \nin the female mammary gland at puberty, these changes could be \nassociated with mammary ductal branching and an acceleration of \nits development.\n337.

Our aim was to analyze if CPF promotes migration and \nthe pathways involved in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Mi -\ngration was evaluated by 2D (wound healing and Boyden Chamber \nassays) and 3D assays (multicellular spheroids).  c-Src, AKT, P38 \nand GSK3-\u03b2 were studied by Western Blot. In MCF-7 cells, 0.05 \u00b5M \nCPF induced the migration after 48 h (p<0.01) that was reversed \nwith IC182,780 (1 nM) and PP2 (1 \u00b5M) together (p<0.001). 50 \u00b5M \nCPF (p<0.001) promoted the migration in a c-Src-dependent way \n(p<0.001).  0.05 (p<0.001) and 50 \u00b5M (p<0.01) CPF induced migra -\ntion on 3D model after 5 days. This increment induced by 0.05 \u00b5M \nand 50 \u00b5M CPF was retarded in presence of IC182,780 (p<0.01 and \np<0.05, respectively). No changes were observed after adding PP2. \nMigration induced by 0.05 \u00b5M and 50 \u00b5M was retarded by adding \nIC182,780 and PP2 (p< 0.001). Healing assays showed that migra -tion induced by 0.05 \u03bcM CPF (p < 0.001) and 50 \u03bcM CPF (p< 0.001) \nwas reverted by adding PP2 (p< 0.001) after 24 h in MDA-MB-231 \ncells. c-Src-dependent-migration was also promoted by 0.05 \u03bcM \nand 50 \u03bcM CPF (p< 0.05) in Boyden chamber assays. \nIn MCF-7 cells 2D culture, 0.05 (p<0.01) and 50 \u03bcM CPF (p<0.001) \nincreased p-c-Src after 15 min.  p-AKT was induced by 0.05 \u00b5M \nCPF after 60 min in ER\u03b1-dependent way (p<0.05). p-AKT was also \ninduced by 50 \u00b5M CPF depending on c-Src (p<0.05). p-GSK-3\u03b2 was \ninduced by 0.05 \u00b5M CPF after 60 min in ER\u03b1 (p<0.01) and c-Src \n(p<0.01) dependent way. p-P38 induced by 0.05 (p<0.01) and 50 \n\u03bcM CPF (p<0.05) was dependent on c-Src. In MDA-MB-231 cells, \nCPF induced p-c-Src after 30 min (p< 0.05) and 60 min (p<0.001). \np-AKT was increased by CPF in an independent way of c-Src acti -\nvation. p-P38 and p-GSK-3\u03b2 could be countered by PP2. We show \nthat CPF promotes the migration of breast cancer cells activating \nc-Src, AKT, GSK-3\u03b2 and P38 pathways pointing out importance to \nminimize the exposure to the pesticide.\n338.

The pesticides hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and chlorpyrifos \n(CPF), both ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), increase \nLINE-1 activation in breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, through \nAhR/c-Src and TGF-\u03b21/Smad3 signaling. Our aim was to evaluate \nif LINE-1 can be activated by pesticide exposure in non-tumorigenic \nmammary epithelial cells NMuMG. We used environmentally rele -\nvant doses of CPF (0.05-50 \u00b5M) and HCB (0.005-5 \u00b5M).\nLINE-1 mRNA levels were examined by RT-qPCR, finding an in -\ncrement after 48 h of exposure with CPF (0.05-5 \u00b5M, p<0.001) and \nHCB (0.005 \u00b5M, p<0.05). c-Src phosphorylation was enhanced after \n15 min of CPF treatment at all assayed doses (p<0.05), but Smad3 \nwas activated only at 5 and 50 \u00b5M (p<0.001), analyzed by Western \nblot (WB). Cells were pretreated with 5 \u00b5M 4,7-orthophenanthroline \n(PHE, AhR inhibitor) or 2 \u00b5M SB431542 (TGF-\u03b21 pathway inhibitor), \nin order to evaluate the role of these pathways in the 5 \u00b5M CPF-in -\nduced LINE-1 expression. RT-qPCR data showed that both inhibi -\ntors prevented the CPF-induced LINE-1 mRNA levels (p<0.01). Pre -\nvious results showed that 0.005 \u00b5M HCB activates the AhR/c-Src \naxis in NMuMG, without changes in Smad3. Here we observed that \nPHE blocked the HCB-induced LINE-1 mRNA levels (p<0.05). CPF \n(5-50 \u00b5M) and HCB (0.05-5 \u00b5M) raised the expression of ORF1p, a \nprotein encoded by LINE-1 (WB, p<0.01). Given that ORF1p nuclear \nlevels are associated with poor prognosis, ORF1p subcellular local -\nization was examined. WB analysis shows that 0.05, 0.5 and 5 \u00b5M \nCPF induced ORF1p nuclear import (p<0.01). HCB enhanced nu -\nclear and cytosolic ORF1p levels at 0.05, 0.5 and 5 \u00b5M (p<0.001). In \nconclusion, HCB and CPF increased LINE-1 expression and ORF1p \nnuclear import in NMuMG, which  could contribute to breast cancer \nrisk.\n339.

We have previously demon -\nstrated that the pesticide Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) stimulates \nbreast cancer progression, facilitating cell migration, invasion, tumor \ngrowth, angiogenesis and metastasis. HCB is a weak ligand for the \nAryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription \nfactor related to tumor and vascular development. Stem cells are of \ngreat interest due to their ability to originate, maintain and expand tu -\nmors, as well as to lead to metastasis and recurrences. Vascular en -\ndothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are \nassociated with tumor angiogenesis. The aim of this work is to ex -\namine the HCB action on the capacity to mammospheres formation, \nexpression of VEGF and COX-2, production of interleukin-10 (IL-\n10), and to determine if the AhR pathway is involved in the effects of \nHCB on tumor cell proliferation and migration. To this end, we used \na Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positive mu -\nrine breast cancer cell line, LM3, incubated with HCB in the pres -\nence or absence of AhR inhibitors. Environmentally relevant HCB \ndoses were used (0.005-5 \u03bcM). HCB stimulated the development \nof mammospheres at all doses tested (p<0.01). In addition, HCB \ninduced the protein expression of VEGF and COX-2 (p<0.05), favor -\ning a proangiogenic environment. In a first approach to the immune \ncompartment, the results showed that HCB decreased intracellular \nlevels of IL-10 (p<0.05). In addition, the exposure to the pesticide \nincreased cell viability (p<0.05), proliferation (p<0.001) and migra -\ntion (p<0.01) in these cells through an AhR pathway-dependent \nmechanism (p<0.01). These results suggest that HCB promotes a \ndedifferentiated profile and the proangiogenic factors expression, \ncontributing to tumor progression in a HER2 breast cancer model.\n340.

Neuqu\u00e9n, Argentina \nThe demand for crude oil hydrocarbons represents a growing con -\ncern worldwide due to pollution problems from drilling, production \nand transportation. Thus, it is important to perform toxicity studies to \nassess the risk associated with these incidents, not only for the en -\nvironment but also for humans. Our aim was to evaluate the effects \nof anthracene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), and mag -\nnetite nanoparticles coated with oleic acid (NP) on breast cancer \ncells proliferation. These NP were developed in the CITAAC for the \nremediation of water contaminated with PAH.\nWe have previously studied the effects of the water-soluble fraction \nof petroleum (WSF) simulating a possible oil spill. WSF exposure \nsignificantly decreased the viability and significantly increased cata -\nlase (CAT) activity of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells \ncompared to controls. As the WSF is a mixture of hydrocarbons we \nconsidered important to study the effects of PAHs individually to \nunderstand if the observed effects were induced by the individual \naction of its components or by the interaction between them.MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were treated for 7d with either \nanthracene (0; 3,5; 7; 15 and 28 \u00b5M) or NP (0; 12,5; 25; 50; 100 and \n200 mg/L) to perform clonogenic assays. No significant differences \nwere observed in the clonogenicity of anthracene treated cells com -\npared to control. However, the exposure to NP from 12,5 to 200 mg/L \nand from 25 to 200 mg/L significantly decreased the clonogenicity \nof MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells respectively ( p<0,0001). These \nresults suggest that other PAHs, such as naphthalene, pyrene and \nothers should be evaluated in order to understand the mechanism \nof action of the toxicity of the hydrocarbons present in the WSF. \nWe also envisage the need of evaluating NP containing PAH after \nremediation to determine potential risks. The effects derived from \nNP alone alert for secure uses avoiding nanomaterial release to the \nenvironment during remediation processes.\n341.

Angiogen -\nesis is critical in endometriosis progression,  is a complex process \ninvolving endothelial cell migration, proliferation, tube formation, \nand survival. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a pow -\nerful angiogenic factor, which  activates downstream effectors such \nas ERK1/2. This signaling  pathway is involved in endothelial cell \nproliferation and migration. Endocrine-disrupting environmental pol -\nlutants are thought to play a role in the development of this disease. \nHexachlorobenzene (HCB) is an organochlorinated pesticide that \nincreases microvessel density and VEGF levels in a rat endometri -\nosis model. Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphate insecticide \nthat acts as an Endocrine Disruptor. The present study examined \nthe effect of HCB and CPF on endometriosis angiogenesis in vitro . \nT-HESCs cells (stromal endometrial cell line) were exposed to HCB \n(0.005, 0.05, 0.5 and 5 \u03bcM) and CPF (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 \u03bcM) or ve -\nhicle for 48h, and the conditioned media were then used to stimulate \nEA.hy926 endothelial cells. The results showed that HCB (0.005, \n0.05 \u03bcM) and CPF (0.5, 5, 50 \u03bcM) induced VEGF secretion (p<0.05) \nin T-HESCs. Moreover, the conditioned media of HCB treatment en -\nhanced the EA.hy926 cells proliferation (PCNA expression and MTT \nassay) (0.005-5 \u03bcM) (p<0.05), migration (scratch motility assay) \n(0.005-0.5 \u03bcM) (p<0.05), ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Western blot) \n(0.005, 0.05 \u03bcM) and tube formation (tube-like structure formation in \nMatrigel assay); increasing total tube length (0.005 \u03bcM p<0.05; 0.5 \n\u03bcM p<0.01) and branching points (0.5 \u03bcM p<0.05). The results with \nCPF conditioned media showed an increase in cell migration rate (5 \n\u03bcM p<0.005). Our results demonstrated that HCB and CPF expo -\nsure induces VEGF secretion in human endometrial cells triggering \nangiogenesis in endothelial cells, a critical event for the endometri -\nosis progression. \n342.

E-mail:  ggiezib@hotmail.com\nCadmium is a toxic metal and a widespread contaminant. The \nmechanisms of its toxicity are not yet fully understood, but it has \nbeen shown that cadmium increases lipid peroxidation and oxidative \nstress in many organs. On the other hand, it has been shown that \nsoy consumption has many benefits for human health. Heat shock \nproteins are a superfamily of proteins that have an important role \nin folding/degradation of proteins. Their expression can be used as \na sensitive biomarker when cells are under stress conditions. Anti -\noxidant response includes enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems. \nThese systems exert a protective effect against free radicals and \noxidative damage. We decided to study the expression of Hsp and \nthe antioxidant response in rat lungs under cadmium intoxication, \nanalyzing the possible protective effects of a soy based diet. 4 lots \nof adult Wistar rats were used: 2 lots received casein and 2 lots, \nsoy as protein source. Within each group, 1 lot received regular tap \nwater and the other 15ppm of Cd (as CdCl2) in drinking water for 60 \ndays. Lungs were removed, fixed and paraffin embedded. Immu -\nnohistochemistry was realized using Hsp27 and Hsp70 antibodies. \nTotal RNA was obtained using QuickZOL reagent, retrotranscribed \nand used for PCR amplification of GPx and SOD-2. CAT activity \nwas measured in lungs homogenate. Results showed that Hsp27 \nexpression increased in both Cd intoxicated groups (p<0.05), being \nhigher in soy fed groups. Hsp70 expression showed no differences \nbetween casein groups, but it revealed a significant increase in Soy-\nCd vs its control. GPx expression augmented in both intoxicated \ngroups (p<0.05), being higher in those fed with soy. SOD-2 mRNA \nlevels showed no differences among casein groups, but it increased \nin Soy-Cd group vs its control (p<0,01). CAT activity augmented in \nCas-Cd group vs its control (p<0.01); however, activity was higher in \nsoy fed groups (p<0,05). Cadmium intoxication generates oxidative \nstress in lungs. Lungs responded increasing the expression and/\nor activity of antioxidant enzymes, being both higher in soy groups. \nSoy diet also improves the expression of Hsps, that protects against \nprotein damage caused by oxidative stress. We concluded then that \na soy rich diet could be a good therapeutic strategy in cases of Cd \nexposure.\n343.

In animals, exposure to CPF \nproduces inhibition of B-esterases (acetylcholinesterase, AChE, \nand carboxylesterases, CES) and multiple toxic effects. However, \nlittle is known about the effect of CPF on endothelium. The aim \nof this work was to explore in vitro effects of CPF on endothelial \ncholinesterase and non-cholinesterase targets. Mouse endothelial \ncell cultures (H5V) were treated with CPF for 24 h. The biochem -\nical parameters analyzed were AChE, CES, antioxidant enzymes \n(catalase, CAT and superoxide dismutase, SOD) and the levels of \nreduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione. Enzyme activities \nwere measured spectrophotometrically and GSH and GSSG levels \nwere determined by the recycling method using GSH reductase. \nROS production was determined by flow cytometry with the fluores -\ncent probe DCF-DA and the morphological analysis was performed \nwith Image J using phase-contrast images. When analyzing cell \nmorphology, a decrease in cell area was observed at CPF concen -\ntrations > 50 \u00b5M (p<0.05). After performing a viability curve, a work -\ning range of sublethal concentrations (0-50 \u00b5M) was established. \nIn this range, AChE inhibition (up to 50%) and CES inhibition (up to 80%) was observed (p<0.05). CAT activity showed an increase \nat 10 \u00b5M and a decrease at 50 \u00b5M CPF (p<0.05). SOD was inhib -\nited around 30% with respect to controls in all treatments (p<0.05). \nGSH/GSSG ratio decreased (\u2248 60%) in all treatments (p<0.05) and \nthe amount of DCF+ cells increased at 10 and 30 \u00b5M CPF. Our re -\nsults show that endothelial cells respond to the presence of subleth -\nal concentrations of CFP, showing B-esterase inhibition and redox \nstate alteration. These in vitro  studies represent a first approach to \nunderstanding the mechanism of toxic action of organophosphate \npesticides on the endothelium.\n344. (354) UTERINE GLANDULAR DYSFUNCTION IN RATS \nEXPOSED TO GLYPHOSATE OR A GLYPHOSATE FOR -\nMULATION:  A POSSIBLE MECHANISM OF IMPLANTA -\nTION FAILURE \nCadaviz DB1, Lorenz V1, Pacini G1, Varayoud J1, Milesi MM1\n1.Instituto de Salud y Ambiente del Litoral (ISAL), Facultad \nde Bioqu\u00edmica y Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas (UNL/CONICET), Santa \nFe, Argentina.\nGlyphosate (Gly) is the active ingredient of multiple herbicide formu -\nlations known as glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs), which are \nthe most globally used pesticides. We have shown that perinatal \nexposure to either Gly or GBH decreased the number of implanted \nembryos in female rats. Here, we investigated whether Gly or GBH \nexposure alter endometrial gland function as a possible mechanism \nresponsible for implantation failures. Pregnant rats (F0) were ex -\nposed to Gly or a GBH through food, in a dose of 2 mg of glyphosate/\nkg/day, from gestational day (GD) 9 until weaning. F1 females were \npregnant and uteri were sampled on GD5 (pre-implantation period) \nfor morphological, immunohistochemical and mRNA analysis. Uter-\nine sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin to analyze the fol -\nlowing morphological features: luminal epithelial height, number of \nglands, and thickness of myometrium and subepithelial stroma. We \nalso determined the expression of molecules that regulate uterine \ngland function and implantation such as, Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) \nand b-catenin which were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and \nleukemia inhibitory factor ( Lif) that was assessed by qPCR. A lower \nnumber of uterine glands in Gly (**p<0.01) and GBH (***p<0.001) \ngroups was detected regarding to the control. Both Gly and GBH \nexposure (*p<0.05 vs control) decreased the expression of Lif. Also, \nFOXA2 (Gly: **p<0.01; GBH: *p<0.05 vs control) and b-catenin (Gly \nand GBH: **p<0.01 vs control) expression levels were decreased in \nthe glandular compartment in both groups. In conclusion, Gly and \nGBH exposure decreased the number of glands in the pre-implan -\ntation uterus, in association with a downregulation of key molecules \nfor endometrial gland activity and implantation. These findings sug -\ngest that uterine gland dysfunction might be a mechanism of Gly- \nand GBH-induced implantation failures. Importantly, Gly and GBH \ninduced similar changes suggesting that both compounds may act \nthrough similar pathways.\n345.

Thioredoxin-1 \n(Trx1) through redox homeostasis regulation have shown an isch -\nemia/reperfusion injury cadioprotection, reducing the infarct size. \nTherefore, the aim of the present project was to further assess the \nTrx1 protection against the cardiopulmonary toxicity initiated by MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

Wild type (WT) and overexpressing Trx-1 (TRX) transgen -\nic mice were intranasally instilled with a ROFA suspension (1 mg/\nkg) or saline. Heart tissue redox metabolism and cardiac function \nwere evaluated 3h after treatment. Trx-1 overexpression was able \nto revert the tissue O2 consumption decreased observed after ROFA \nexposure (p<0.05). Regarding the antioxidant system, higher GSH \nlevels found in TRX mice lead to no differences in GSH/GSSG ratio \nbetween groups, while SOD activity was decreased in TRX-ROFA \nmice ( p<0.05). The increased phospholipids oxidation observed in \nROFA treated WT mice ( p<0.01) returned to control values in the \nTRX group even after ROFA exposure. Left ventricular contractile \nand lusitropic reserve was evaluated as LVDP and t50, before and \nafter a \u03b2-adrenergic stimulus with isoproterenol (ISO) (1 \u03bcM), re -\nvealing that the LVDP increment was significantly lower in WT mice \nexposed to ROFA compared to saline while no differences were ob -\nserved among TRX groups ( p<0.05). Similar trends were observed \nin T50, showing an impaired relaxation response due to ROFA inhala -\ntion which was abolished by the Trx-1 overexpression. Here we are \nshowing that Trx-1 overexpression restores the ventricular reserve \nafter an acute exposure to ROFA. These findings contribute to the \nunderstanding of the adverse health effects triggered by PM-initiat -\ned redox metabolism alterations.\n346.

As inhalation is one of the main \nroutes of exposure, the aim of this study was to evaluate the AgNP \nharmful effects in the lung. Characterization of AgNP was performed \nby DLS, TEM and EPR, while biodistribution studies were done us -\ning radio labeled 99mTc-AgNP. In vivo  studies in balb/c mice intrana -\nsally instilled with 0.1 mg AgNP/kg b.w were performed, where O2 \nmetabolism was analyzed 1h after AgNP inhalation. In vitro studies \nusing A549 cells and a 3D lung tissue model, were done after 1h \nexposure to 2.5 \u00b5g AgNP/mL. AgNP showed a hydrodynamic diam -\neter of 17 \u00b1 6 nm and were able to initiate the hemolytic cleavage of \nH2O2 leading to OH\u2022 production. In vivo  results showed the lung as \nthe main deposition organ, where AgNP initiate alveolar epithelium \nbarrier injury, revealed by increased protein content and total cell \ncount in BAL samples (46%;120%; p<0.05).  AgNP triggered tissue \nO2 consumption increase by 31% ( p<0.05), due to increased 44% \nNOX activity ( p<0.05) and a higher mitochondrial active respiration \n(55%; p<0.001), leading to increased H2O2 production rate as mito -\nchondrial complex I activity increased (28%; p<0.01 ; 39%; p<0.05  \nrespectively). Increased ROS release triggered the antioxidant sys -\ntem activation as increased SOD and catalase activities ( p<0.01; \np<0.01) and a 35% decreased GSH/GSSG ratio ( p<0.05) were ob -\nserved.  In A549 cells, AgNP showed 49% increased NOX activity \n(p<0.05), 40% decreased mitochondrial ATP associated respiration \nand higher H2O2 production rate (72%; p<0.001) leading to oxidative \ndamage (23%; p<0.01). Moreover, the lung 3D tissue model showed \nAgNP-initiated barrier alterations as TEER values decreased (20%  p<0.05). Taken together, these results show that AgNP exposure al -\nters O2 metabolism leading to a redox imbalance. AgNP-triggered \noxidative damage may be responsible for the impaired lung function \nobserved due to alveolar epithelial injury.\n347.

Using an in vitro assay of blastocyst \nimplantation, we analyzed the effect of three different BP3 concen -\ntrations: a) BP3-2: the predicted non-effect concentration (PNEC: 2 \n\u03bcg/L), b) BP3-20: the concentration detected in the amniotic fluid (20 \n\u03bcg/L) in our previous studies and c) BP3-200: the plasma concen -\ntrations reported in humans (200 \u03bcg/L). Blastocysts from 3.5 days \npregnant mice (C57BL/6J) were transferred to a monolayer of autol -\nogous uterine epithelial cells (UECs) and cultured in the presence \nof vehicle (0.01 % DMSO) or BP3 for 6 days. Blastocyst expansion, \nhatching and implantation in the monolayer as well as implantation \narea were analyzed microscopically and recorded every 12 h. To \nverify the in vivo relevance of the in vitro results, pregnant C57BL/6J \nmice were exposed via dermal route to BP3-50 (50-mg BP3 kg.day) \nor olive oil (vehicle) from gestation day (gd) 0 to gd10. The mice \nwere sacrificed at gd10 and the size of the whole implantation sites \n(WIS) was measured.\nIn vitro exposure to BP3-2 and BP3-200 altered the blastocysts \nexpansion. Moreover, the hatching and the implantation time were \ndelayed and the implantation areas were significantly smaller than \nthose from the control with all BP3 concentrations assayed. In \nvivo study reaffirms the in vitro results, since we found that BP3-\n50-exposed WIS was smaller than those exposed to the vehicle. \nPreviously, we showed that in vivo dermal BP3-50 produced an in -\ntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) phenotype and lower offspring \nweight of first progeny. Here, we could demonstrate that BP3 dis -\nrupts blastocyst implantation and early embryo development. Our \nresults suggest that an underlying mechanism by which BP3 affects \npregnancy are linked to disruption of the implantation stage, leading \nconsequently to a reduction in embryo size.\n348.

Argentina \nFumonisin B1 (FB1) is a mycotoxin that occurs as a frequent contam -\ninant of corn and corn-based foods in Argentina, has an inhibitory \neffect on ceramide synthetase, key enzyme in the biosynthesis of \nsphingolipids. The effects of FB1 on the plasma membrane and on \noxidative stress led us to propose a possible role of FB1 on the ag -\ning of erythrocytes (EC). Our objective  was to assay techniques \nto determine the aging of EC to apply to the exposure study by fu -\nmonisins. Materials and Methods:  Male 1-month Wistar rats were \nseparated into two groups of 1 animal. The control rat was given \nsaline solution while the other rat received orally for 20 days 1 mg/ \nkg/day of FB1 from a culture of Fusarium proliferatum. Erythrocyte \nmalondialdehyde (MDA) was measured according to the method of \nKumar et al. The binding of alcian blue (AB) to human or rat EC, to \nmeasure the effect of fumonisin on erythrocyte charge, was studied \nby the method of Ponce de Leon et al. In vitro  experiments, EC 5% \nin PBS was added to three tubes (0, 50 and 100 ng of FB1), incu -\nbated at 37 \u00ba 24 hs. Results: In experiments in vivo , TBA results \nshowed no significance differences between treated and control rat \n(p = 0.7117, p <0.05) neither in conditions in vitro  between eryth -\nrocytes incubated with 50 ng or 100 ng of FB1 vs the control (p = \n0.8706 and p = 0.6128, p <0.05 respectively). For AB, measured \nas percentage erythrocyte anionic charge (EAC%), no significant \ndifferences were found between the control vs the treated rats (p \n= 0.7044, p <0.005)  nor in the results of EAC% of treated with 50 \nng or 100 ng of FB1 vs control(p = 0.418 and p = 0.3488, p <0.05 \nrespectively). Conclusions:  Considering in vitro  experiments, it was \nobserved that concentration of FB1 used in our case, were much \nsmaller than other studies, therefore we will continue the analysis \nunder those conditions. In case of in vivo  experiments, we need to \ncontinue these preliminary assays to study the effects of fumonisin \nexposure.\n350.

We selected 72 \nparaffin- embedded tissue samples from a cohort of archived ccCCR \nfrom the files of the Histolopathology service in Vidal Hospital, Cor -\nrientes from 2005 to 2019. Our results show that the membrane \nexpression of ErbB-2 (MErbB-2) is 40% (29/73). However, it is not \nrelated to the stage (Chi-square test ns, Stage I and II vs III and IV). \nWe explored the nuclear expression of ErbB-2 (NErbB-2) and 67% \nresulted positive (1+ 33%, 2+ 28%, 3+ 8%). We show that nuclear \nErbB2 (NErbB-2) is correlated with high Fuhrman Nuclear Grade \n(FNG) Chi-square test *P=0.017 FNG 1 vs 2, ***P=0.0009 FNG 1 vs \n3/4. Nuclear EGFR and ErbB-3 expression and the correlation with \nnuclear ErbB-2 were also explored. Our results show that, nuclear \nexpression of EGFR (NEGFR) is 1+ (11%), 2+ (38%), 3+ (30%) and \nnuclear expression of ErbB-3 is 1+ (9%), 2+ (14%), 3+ (40%). The \ncorrelation of Pearson was positive for both NEGFR (**P=0.02) and \nNErbB-3 (**P=0.07) vs NErbB-2. Our findings showed that ErbB-2 is \nimplicated in the carcinogenesis renal. It is very important to locate \nErbB-2 because in the clear cell renal cell carcinoma nuclear ErbB-2 \nis associated with high FNG. The molecular mechanism of ErbB-2 \nnuclear location seems to be related to ErbB-2/EGFR and ErbB-2/\nErbB-3 in renal cell carcinoma.  \n351.

IQUIBICEN-UBA/CONICET\nBeside its role in ribosome biogenesis, the nucleolus senses stress \nand is a central hub for coordinating the stress response. \nMageB2 is a tumor specific protein with nucleolar localization. Re -\nlated with its localization, we have previously observed that MageB2 \nenhances pre-rRNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis.\nHere we aim to study the involvement of MageB2 in the nucleolar \nresponses to stress.\nFirst, we screened MageB2 protein interactors by performing yeast \ntwo-hybrid and immunoprecipitation (IP) follow by mass spectrom -\netry assays. Our results, together with reported ones, showed that, \nbeyond MageB2 interactors involved ribosome biogenesis, 34 and \n17 out of 213 interactors were related with the GO terms \u201cCellu -\nlar response to stress\u201d (GO:0033554) and \u201cRegulation of apoptotic \nsignaling pathway\u201d (GO:2001233), respectively, supporting a role of \nMageB2 in these biological processes.\nActinomycin D (ActD) at low concentration inhibits RNA Pol I and \ninduces nucleolar stress, with the consequent redistribution of some \nnucleolar proteins. Under this condition, we observed that MageB2 \nrelocalized to the nucleoplasm. Besides, MageB2 IP followed by \nwestern blot showed that ActD treatment resulted in MageB2 phos -\nphorylation in Tyrosine.\nWe also observed that MageB2 expression correlated with resis -\ntance to apoptosis induced by ActD treatment. However, luciferase \nreporter gene assay of a p53 responsive promoter demonstrated \nthat MageB2 was not able to regulate p53 function. Moreover, IP as -\nsays showed no binding between MageB2 and p53. In line with this, \nsiRNA mediated down-regulation of p53 in U24 cells did not affect \nthe resistance effect of MageB2, suggesting that MageB2 confers \nresistance to ActD in a p53 independent manner.\nAltogether, this result suggests that nucleolar stress induced by \ntreatment with ActD changes the localization and phosphorylation \nstatus of MageB2. Under this condition, MageB2 is able to counter -\nact apoptosis in a p53 independent manner.MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020150\n352.

We have previously \ndemonstrated that the expression of the transcriptional coactivator \nRAC3 decreases during adipocyte differentiation, favoring the pro -\ncess through an increase of autophagy and a decrease in the pro -\nliferative rate.\nIn order to determine the mechanism whereby RAC3 expression \nlevels are regulated during adipogenesis, we performed public \ndatasets analysis and evaluated RAC3 and miRNAs expression \nduring adipocyte differentiation (GSE20696 and 20298). After 7 \ndays of differentiation, in the murine preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cell line \n(GSE20696), we observed RAC3 expression was downregulated \n(43.6% +/- 0.9% respect to control, p<0.01), corroborating the re -\nsults obtained by our group in the L929 cell line.\nBy ISMARA platform, we performed an analysis of computationally \npredicted regulatory sites for transcription factors and miRNAs in -\nvolved in RAC3 regulation during differentiation and we observed \nthat the predicted binding activity for transcription factors was dimin -\nished but for miRNAs was increased, at 2 and 7 days after adipocyte \ndifferentiation.\nUsing TargetScan and MirSystem platforms, we found that the mem -\nbers of miR-17-92 family have a high score of binding in the mu -\nrine and human RAC3 3?UTR. However, only miR17-5p has been \nvalidated for regulating RAC3 in human cells. Therefore, we ana -\nlysed miRNA expression in GSE20698 dataset and observed that \nthe expression levels of four mir-17-92 family members, miR-17-5p, \nmiR-20a-5p, miR-20b-5p and miR-93-5p, were increased at 2 day of \ndifferentiation (>1.5-fold change respect to control).\nWe could conclude that the regulation of RAC3 expression during \nadipocyte differentiation not only occurs at transcriptional level but \nalso may involve post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms th\n353.

Re -\ncently, the GPR75 receptor has been identified as the target for 20-\nHETE. The aim of this study was to identify the role of the 20-HETE/\nGPR75 axis in the AR transcriptional activity (ARTA) in LNCaP cells. \nThe following methods were used: immunofluorescence (intracellu -\nlar localization of AR); reporter gene assay (ARTA in LNCaP cells \ntransfected with PSA-Luc); chemiluminescence (prostate specific \nantigen (PSA) quantification).  Stadistic: two tails t-student test, one-\nway ANOVA followed by Dunnet?s. Both, 20-HETE (0.1nM, 45min) and DHT (10nM, 30min) increased by 63%, the abundance of AR \nin the nuclei (p<0.0001 for both), which was sustained for 60min \n(20-HETE) or 120min (DHT). Inhibition of the synthesis of 20-HETE \nby HET0016 (10uM, 36h) reduced by 65.7% the spontaneous ARTA \n(p<0.001) and by 76.5% the induced by DHT (10nM, 36h, p<0.001). \n20-HETE (0.1nM, 36h) increased the ARTA by 178% (p<0.0001) \nand potentiated the effect of DHT by 58% (p<0.0001 vs. DHT). This \nresponse was inhibited by the GPR75 antagonist 19-HEDE (p<0.01 \nvs. 20-HETE; p<0.0001 vs 20-HETE+DHT). The effect of 20-HETE \non ARTA was decreased by the inhibition of PKA, PKC and PI3K by \n47.5% (p\u22640.01), 39.9% (p\u22640.01) and 56.9% (p\u22640.001) respective -\nly. Instead, inhibition of tyrosine- protein kinases (genistein, 5uM, \n36h) increased ARTA by 196.8% (p\u22640.01) per se, and augmented by \n113.6% 20-HETE- induced ARTA (p\u22640.0001). In line, 20-HETE (0.1 \nnM, 48h) increased by 58% PSA protein secretion to the conditioned \nmedium (p<0.05) and this was abrogated by coincubation with 19-\nHEDE (p<0.01 vs 20-HETE). Our results strongly suggest a role for \n20-HETE/GPR75 axis in the regulation of the ARTA, which involves \nthe activation of PKA, PKC and PI3K pathways. 20-HETE- induced \ntranslocation of AR to the nucleus may account for this effect.\n354.

Instituto de Investigaciones en Microbiolog\u00eda y Parasitolo -\ng\u00eda M\u00e9dica (UBA-CONICET)\nBenznidazole (Bz) is the drug-of-choice in many countries for the \ntreatment of Chagas Disease. Although it has been used in clinical \nsettings for a long time, its mechanisms of action have not been fully \nelucidated yet. Indeed, there is a general premise that the etiologi -\ncal treatment contributes to a reduction of the parasite load and to \nfit the host immune response, leading to a balanced inflammatory \nresponse which is crucial to control Chagas disease morbidity. In \naddition to its parasiticidal effect, we have previously reported that \nBz inhibits the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway by increasing the ex -\npression of SOCS3 through the IL-10/STAT3/SOCS3 pathway. Fur -\nthermore, in preliminary results, we showed that PI3K participates \nin this effect in cardiac cells. In this work, we assessed this issue \nin a macrophage (M\u0444) cell line (RAW 264.7). M\u0444 were pre-treat -\ned with 15uM Bz and stimulated with 10 \u00b5g/ml of LPS. The treat -\nments were performed, in parallel, in the presence of LY294002, a \nspecific inhibitor of PI3K activity. To deepen the knowledge of the \nmechanism of action, we also used CAL-101, a specific inhibitor of \nthe p110\u03b4 catalytic subunit of the Class IA isoform of PI3K. Inhibi -\ntion was confirmed by the absence of phosphorylation of P70S6K \n(p<0.05). Under these conditions, Bz was unable to inhibit the acti -\nvation of NF-\u03baB, evidenced by the expression of cytosolic I\u03baB\u03b1, the \nexpression of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and the release of nitrites to \nthe culture supernatant (p<0.05). Furthermore, Bz couldn\u2019t increase \nSOCS3 expression in both conditions (p<0.0001). These preliminary \nresults suggest that Bz exerts it\u2019s anti-inflammatory effect, not only in \nan IL-10/STAT3/SOCS3-dependent but also in a Class IA-PI3K-de -\npendent manner. \n355.

Instituto de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas (UCA-CONICET).\n2. Universidad Nacional de La Pampa.\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in \nthe CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) gene. The \npulmonary damage observed in severe patients is the major cause \nof morbidity and mortality due to chronic infections and unresolved \ninflammation. The reduction in the airway surface liquid (ASL) pH \nis one of the hypotheses that tried to explain the high susceptibili -\nty to lung infections. Together with a reduced bicarbonate transport ABSTRACTS151\nthrough CFTR, an increase in lactic acid secretion could also explain \nthe changes in extracellular pH. The aim of the present work was to \ndetermine if the EGFR pathway is involved in the pH regulation in \nCF cells. Two cellular models were used: IB3-1 cells (bronchial epi -\nthelial cells derived from a CF patient with a \u0394F508/W1282X CFTR \ngenotype) and C38 cells (IB3-1 \u201ccorrected\u201d cells). The results re -\nported a decrease in pH in the extracellular medium culture (p<0.05) \nin IB3-1 cells concomitantly with an increased in lactate secretion \nand both LDH expression and activity (p<0.05) compared with C38 \ncells. These results confirmed that the CFTR regulates significantly \n(p<0.05) the pH, lactate secretion and LDH expression and activity. \nAs we have previously observed the role of the EGFR pathway in \nthe CF phenotype, we studied if this signaling pathway is also in -\nvolved in pH regulation. Here, we observed that EGFR modulates \nsignificantly (p<0.05) the pH in the extracellular medium, the lactic \nacid (lactate) secretion (p<0.05) and the LDH expression and ac -\ntivity (p<0.05) in CF cells. In conclusion, our results showed that \nCFTR channel activity (or expression) regulates not only the pH, but \nalso the lactic acid secretion and LDH expression and activity and \nthe EGFR pathway is partially involved in this regulation. The low \npH microenvironment observed in CF cells could promote the im -\npairment of immune function and consequently the establishment of \ninfections in people with CF (PWCF).

Universidad de Buenos Aires.\nNanotubules (Tunneling nanotubules, TnTs) are cell membrane pro -\njections made of F-actin fibers of nanometric diameter (up to 1 \u03bcm), \nwhich enable cytoplasmatic connections between cells. It has been \nshown that mitochondria, other organelles, and cellular components \nare transferred by TnTs in several normal and tumor cell lines. TnTs \nestablishment has been extensively described in nervous system \ncells, as neurons and astrocytes. Published evidence indicates the \nexistence of mitochondrial transfer through TnTs between different \ncell types, such as normal and tumoral cells. Mitochondrial passage \nfrom normal to tumor cells restores oxidative metabolism, decreas -\ning tumorigenic potential. A similar effect has been observed with \ncAMP, a very well-known astrocytes stellation promoter, which me -\ndiates mitochondrial biogenesis and tumor growth inhibition. Mito -\nchondrial transfer within TnTs in nervous system cells have not been \ndemonstrated so far. Then, our goal was to analyze mitochondrial \ntrafficking through TnTs in normal and tumoral astrocytes and a \npossible effect of cAMP. We used normal rat astrocytes and human \nglioblastoma U87 cells. Mitochondria and actin were probed with a \nmito-targeted green fluorescent protein and phalloidin, respective -\nly. Astrocytes and U87 were incubated with or without 8Br-cAMP \n(cAMP analogue). We analyzed images by confocal microscopy and \nmeasured the width of actin connections between cells. We analyzed \neach culture separately; astrocytes and U87 establish thick projec -\ntions containing mitochondria but treatment with cAMP promotes an \nincrease of TnTs-like connections with mitochondria inside (control \nvs cAMP: astrocytes: 2.07\u00b10.71 vs 0.85\u00b10.21 \u03bcm, ***p<0.05; U87: \n2.69\u00b11.40 vs.0.84\u00b10.22 \u03bcm, *p<0.05, \u00b1 SD, ANOVA, Tukey test). \nThus, cAMP promotes TnTs-like structures and mitochondrial pas -\nsage through them in normal astrocytes and glioblastoma cells, sug -\ngesting a role for intercellular mitochondrial transfer through TnTs in \nstellation process.\n357.

In this study, we hypoth -\nesized that TPR-domain proteins regulate the subcellular localiza -\ntion of GR. It is shown that GR nuclear accumulation is impaired by \noverexpression of the recombinant TPR peptide. This disrupts the \nassociation between GR-Hsp90 an FKBP52, and consequently, the \nassociation with dynein is lost. It also causes loss of association with \nthe importin-\u03b21 adapter transporter (KPNB1), the nuclear pore-as -\nsociated glycoprotein Nup62 and structures associated with the nu -\nclear matrix. The final GR distribution is the result of the combination \nof two processes: decreased nuclear import and improved nuclear \nexport. Interestingly, leptomycin B (a CRM1/exportin-1 inhibitor) \nabolished the effects of TPR peptide overexpression despite not \nhaving inhibitory effect itself on the nuclear GR export. These results \nstrongly suggest the existence of a TPR domain-dependent mecha -\nnism for nuclear protein export. In summary, our study demonstrates \na strong relationship between TPR proteins and the nuclear import \nmechanism of the receptor, as well as their potential capability to \nfavour the anchorage of the GR to nuclear structures. We propose \nthat the balance of expression of the TPR domain proteins bound to \nthe GR-Hsp90 complex can determine the subcellular localization \nand the nucleocytoplasmic properties of the receptor and, therefore, \nits pleiotropic biological properties in different tissues or cell types.\nKEY WORDS: Glucocorticoid receptor, Tetratricopeptide repeats, \nImmunophilins, FKBP52, Hsp90, Nuclear matrix\n358.

On the other hand, post-lactational involution is characterized \nby the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors that trigger mammary \ncell apoptosis. LXR is an anti-inflammatory transcription factor pres -\nent in all developmental stages of the mouse mammary gland.The \ngoal of this study was to determine whether LXR plays a relevant \nrole during the lactation/involution switch. Female C57/bl6 mice \nwere treated with the LXR agonist GW3965 (10 mg/kg) or DMSO \n(control) by IP injection at weaning, 48h or 96h post weaning (n=3 \nper group). At those times, mice were euthanized and pieces of their \ninguinal mammary glands were either fixed in formalin or frozen at \n-800C. Fixed tissue was later processed for histological studies, \nwhile proteins and RNA were extracted from frozen samples. On \nthe other hand, we analyzed the effects of GW3965 (10-6M) com -\npared to Dexamethasone (Dex), Dex+Prl or DMSO for 72h on HC11 \nmouse mammary cells in culture. Our results show that LXR activa -\ntion inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNFa and \nLIF mRNA at 48h and 96h after weaning (by RT-qPCR), together \nwith an increase of the anti-inflammatory tristetraprolin (TTP) protein \n(by Western blot analysis) at 96 hs. In addition, by immunohisto -MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

Importantly, GW3965 treatment \ndid not trigger STAT5 phosphorylation as the lactogenic hormones \nDex+Prl. Taken together, these results show that activation of LXR \ninhibits involution associated events and promotes the lactogenic \nphenotype in the mammary epithelium by a Prl-Stat5 independent \nsignaling pathway. \nSAI\nINMUNOLOG\u00cdA\n359.

Recently, heightened hypoxia has been \ndescribed as an important environmental factor in IBD, and microR -\nNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical mediators of gene expres -\nsion; however, a connection between them in IBD has not been \nthoroughly explored. Our objective is to unveil molecular and envi -\nronmental factors modulating the intestinal glycome during IBD. We \nstarted by analyzing data from several miRNAs databases, search -\ning for those dysregulated in IBD, hypoxic conditions and that could \nmodulate inflammation, angiogenesis and glycosylation. Cross data \nanalysis showed candidate miRNAs mir-155, mir-146 and mir-124 \nas regulators of several glycosyltransferases (ST6GAL1, ST6GAL2, \nFUT8, FUT11, MGAT4, MGAT5) and the mannosidase MAN1A1. By \nusing publicly available datasets from IBD patients (E-MTAB-2967) \nwe found that ST6GAL1, STGAL2, FUT8 y FUT11 were upregu -\nlated (p<0,05), while MGAT4A, and MAN1A1 were downregulated \n(p<0,05). Finally, in order to understand if these altered transcrip -\ntomic profiles were mirrored by glycophenotypical changes in vitro , \nwe explored the glycosylation profile of two colon cell lines (HCT116 \nand HT29) cultured under hypoxia with proinflammatory cytokines \nrelevant to IBD. Cell cultures were carried out in normoxic and hy -\npoxic (1%O2) conditions with or without IL1, IL6 and TNFa. Glyco -\nphenotyping of these cells by flow cytometry showed an increase \nin b(1-6) complex N-glycans (p<0,05), \u03b1(1-3) and \u03b1(1-6) fucosyla -\ntion (p<0,05) and \u03b1(2-6) sialylation (p<0,05). Interestingly, the most \nprominent driver of these changes was hypoxia. Taken together, our \nexperimental data confirms a glycome shifting that correlates with \ndysregulated glycosyltransferases in transcriptomic data from IBD \npatients. We are currently connecting these changes with candidate \nmiRNAs and explore their role during the course of IBD.\n360.

After \ntreatments, the cells were cultured for 24 h without stimuli to ob -\ntain conditioned media (CM). IL-6 concentration in CM was mea -\nsured by ELISA. RAW cells were incubated with CM for 7 days and \nthen tartrate resistant acid phosphatase positive (TRAP+) cells and \nMMP-9 activity were determined by histochemistry and gel zymog -\nraphy, respectively.  Results: SME decreased IL-6 secretion induced \nby IL-1\u03b2 in MC3T3-E1 cells, being this effect dose-independent \n(% inh= 91.8 \u00b13.8 at 10 ng/mL, p<0.001 respect to IL-1\u03b2). E2 dose \ndependently inhibited the IL-6 secretion induced by IL-1\u03b2 (% inh= \n69.7 \u00b16.4 at 10-6 M, p<0.001 respect to IL-1\u03b2). RAW cells treated \nwith CM from MC3T3-E1 cells that had been cultured with IL-1\u03b2 plus \n10 ng/ml SME (IL-1\u03b2+SME CM), showed a reduction in the TRAP+ \ncell numbers and the MMP-9 activity compared to cells treated \nwith IL-1\u03b2 CM (p<0.05). Again, E2 exerted an inhibitory effect in a \ndose-dependent manner (p<0.05 respect to IL-1\u03b2 CM). Our results \nsuggest that SME is capable to diminish the osteoclast differentia -\ntion induced by inflammatory osteoblastic cells by a mechanism that \ncould involve the inhibition of IL-6 secretion.\n361.

C\u00f3rdoba. Argentina.\nDietary tryptophan is catabolized by the intestinal microbiota into \nmetabolites such as indoles and their derivatives. Our hypothesis \nproposes that a reduced availability of tryptophan metabolites at \nthe interface of the intestinal mucosa causes a dysregulation of the \nepithelial barrier that results in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). \nTo test this hypothesis, we evaluated the content of dietary tryp -\ntophan, the circulating tryptophan in plasma and the presence of \nurinary tryptophan metabolites in 11 control volunteers, 15 patients \nwith Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and 10 patients with Crohn\u2019s Disease \n(CD). Daily tryptophan intake was calculated based on a food sur -\nvey by a nutrition health professional, plasma tryptophan levels were \nmeasured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) \nand tryptophan metabolites were determined in urine using mass \ndetector coupled gas chromatography (GC-MS). IBD activity in pa -\ntients was clinically estimated using the Mayo index (UC) or the Har -\nvey-Bradshaw index (CD). Dietary and plasmatic tryptophan levels \nwere comparable in all the study groups. The amount of tryptophan ABSTRACTS153\nconsumed was directly correlated with the excretion values detect -\ned for the tryptophan metabolite 1H-indole-2,3-dione (r = 0.7631, p \n= 0.0168). In addition, non-tryptophan derived metabolites such as \ncitric acid or 2-hydroxybutyric acid were able to discriminate patients \nwith IBD from the control group. Although the amount of tryptophan \nconsumed was not related to the activity of IBD in patients with UC, \nwe found that the amount of tryptophan consumed was inversely \ncorrelated with the stage of IBD in patients with CD (r = -0.6971, p \n= 0.0251). Our findings suggest that increasing the amount of tryp -\ntophan in the diet may decrease IBD activity in patients with CD \nand that metabolomic profile of patients with IBD can provide a new \nprecision medicine tool to improve the management and the quality \nof life of patients with IBD.\n362.

For in -\nstance, T cell subsets engaged in B cell activation and differenti -\nation, as well as memory T cells. Based on their surface markers, \nmemory T CD4+ cells are classified into two subsets: the central \nmemory T (TCM) cells expressing CD44+ and CD62Lhigh which facil -\nitate their homing to the secondary lymphoid organs; and the effec -\ntor memory T (TEM) cells which are CD44+/CD62Llow  and exit into \ncirculation toward peripheral tissues. The aim of this cross-sectional \nstudy was to characterize the immunophenotype markers of mem -\nory T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood from five patients with \ntype 1 AIH, attending at the Gastroenterology Service of Hospital \nProvincial del Centenario de Rosario. Five healthy subjects were \nincluded as controls (Co). All patients were treated with prednisone \nand azathioprine at the time of blood collection. Peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained and processed by flow \ncytometric analysis. AIH patients were positive for anti-ANA or an -\nti-SMA antibodies showing higher levels of serum IgG, IgM, and IgA \nif compared to Co. The AIH group presented significantly increased \nand decreased levels of TCM and TEM cells, respectively in com -\nparison from values in the control group (P\u22640.05). Such increase in \nTCM cells may be reflecting a pathogenetic role in AIH. Specifically, \nthe higher percentage of TCM cells at the peripheral level, may be \nassociated with a Th2 response profile, and hence responsible for \nelevated gamma globulin fraction (mostly IgG and IgA) as well as \nthe presence of autoantibody levels.\n363.

Integration of a complex \nset of immunophenotypic, morphological, clinical, and cytogenetic \ninformation is essential for the subclassification of B-cell chronic \nlymphoproliferative diseases (B-CLPD).\nPhenotyping is essential for the diagnostic classification of many \nB-CLPD cases, but the current immunophenotyping strategies also \nface several difficulties. In view of these issues, new methods to facilitate the identification of abnormal B-cell populations in routine \nclinical flow cytometric data would be desirable.\nMethods: We used both 12 and 8 colour staining panels and we \napplied high dimensional reduction (viSNE) and clustering tools to \ndiscriminate between CD5+ B-CLPD cases. Samples from already \ndiagnosed CLL and MCL were analyzed (n=6) and healthy patients\u2019 \ncells were used as controls. \nResults:  High dimensional reduction (viSNE) revealed at least 6 \nindividual clusters that corresponded to each CD5+ B-CLPD sam -\nple. In addition, the two dimensions spatial distribution of the pop -\nulations showed segregation by disease type (n=6, p<0.05). Con -\nversely, healthy control samples were separated in two clusters, but \nall the samples showed overlapping (p=NS). Clustering suggested \nthe heterogeneity in markers expression in each disease sample. \nFor instance, we detected clusters with higher expression of Ig-k \nand CD20, that corresponded to MCL samples, p<0.05 and p<0.01, \nrespectively. Deeper analysis of these samples is currently under \ninvestigation. \nConclusions:  These preliminary results suggest that combination \nof high dimensional reduction and clustering might be an additional \ntool that can be used, at least, to distinguish between CD5+ B-CLPD. \nFurther research is required to confirm these results and to evaluate \nthe power of these tools in the classification of atypical forms of the \nB-CLPD. \n364.

The \naim of this work is to analyze if hydatid fluid (HF) from Echinococcus, \nconstituted by a wide range of parasite proteins could trigger auto -\nphagy improving antigen presentation and T cell proliferation. Meth -\nods: BMDCs were cultured in complete RPMI. Hydatid fluid (HF) was \npunctured from the hydatid cysts collected of infected cattle slaugh -\ntered. Antigen uptake was measured with (FITC-OVA) in BMDCs \nusing a standard method. HF-stimulated BMDCs, were evaluated in \nautophagy induction and MHC II expression. For it, fixed cells were \nimmunostained with LC3-b (clone H50) and analyzed them by im -\nmunofluorescence confocal microscopy. CFSE-stained splenocytes \nwere co-incubated with BMDCs using a DC: splenocyte ratio of 1:4 \nCellular proliferation was assayed after 4 days of culture by flow \ncytometry. Results: First, we evaluated if stimulation of HF during 18 \nh in BMDCs, induce different rates of antigen uptake. Effectively, the \npresence of Echinococcus antigens induces a markedly decreased \nOVA-uptake compared to control (**p <0.01, n=3). Next, we studied \nif stimulation with Eg antigens induces changes in the basal lev -\nel of autophagy. HF-stimulated BMDCs significantly enhanced the \nmean fluorescence intensity of MHC II and LC3 and showed a trend \nin the increment of number and the average size of LC3-positive \nstructures in comparison with unstimulated cells (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, \n***p<0.001 HF-stimulated cells vs controls). Finally, we observed \nthat culture splenocytes in the presence of stimulated DC induce \ntheir proliferation % CFSE+ cells CTRL:99%, HF:55% (***p<0.001, \nn=3). Conclusions: These data suggest that HF of Echinococcus \ninduces an increase in autophagy processes promoting the presen -\ntation of exogenous antigens presented in MHC II molecules to im -\nprove T cell proliferation.\n365.

Laboratorio de Zoonosis Parasitaria, FCEyN, UNMdP.\nBackground: The laminar layer is an acellular structure rich in gly -\ncans that surrounds the metacestode, creating a mechanical and \nimmunological protective barrier, crucial in the Echinococcus?host \ninterface. The aim of this work is to analyze if purified laminar layer \n(pLL) could trigger maturation and cytokine production in dendritic \ncells by activating mTOR pathway, a central regulator of cell metab -\nolism and environmental signals. Methods: BMDCs were cultured in \ncomplete RPMI supplemented with 100 ng/ml Flt3-L.\nThe germinal layer was removed from pLL by washing with 2M NaCl. \nFlow cytometry: FITC or PE-conjugated mAbs directed to CD11c, \nCD40, CD80, CD86, MHC I and MHC II were used. Immunoblot -\ning and confocal microscopy: mouse anti-puromycin and rabbit an -\nti-Phospho-mTOR antibodies were used. Gene expression analysis \nof IL-10, IL-12p35, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-23p19, TGF-b was performed \non a Real Time PCR System Results: The pLL of Echinococcus in -\nduce a non-statistically significant, but a trend in the up-regulation \nof CD86 and MHC II and that expression change was diminished \nby the use of rapamycin (n=5). Conversely, no changes in the ex -\npression of CD40, CD80 or MHC I were registered. Further studies \nwere done to analyze whether pLL was also able to stimulate the \nproduction of cytokines by BMDCs. When BMDCs were stimulated \nwith pLL induce the expression of IL-6 and TNF-a (n=3 *p<0.05, \n**p<0.01), but not differences compared to control were observed in \nIL-12, IL-23, IL-10 and TGF-b. Finally, we evaluated global protein \nsynthesis and phosphorylation of mTOR using confocal microscopy \nor western blot. pLL (MFI:_979) showed an increase in translation \nlevels compared to its counterpart without stimulation (MFI:_686, \n*p<0.05 n=3) and also induce an increase in mTOR phosphorylation \nlevels compared to untreated BMCDs (n=3, p<0.01) Conclusions: \nThese data suggest that Echinococcus pLL are recognized by DCs \nand induce activation of mTOR pathway favoring cell activation.\u00e5\n366.

Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nTrypanosoma cruzi  is an obligate intracellular parasite and stealth \ninvader that causes a chronic infection affecting millions of people \nworldwide. Benznidazole, the first line antiparasitic drug, has been \nused for 50 years and is effective during the acute phase of the in -\nfection. However, its use in chronic phase where most cases are di -\nagnosed, is still controversial. Considering these issues developing \nprophylactic and/or therapeutic vaccines might contribute to public \nhealth.\nIn this context, our laboratory has developed Traspain, a novel chi -\nmeric antigen that displays key domains for humoral and cytotoxic \nanti-parasite immune response. In order to improve antigen-specific \ncell-mediated immunity, we designed a low-seroprevalence recom -\nbinant adenoviral vector (Ad48) carrying Traspain gene. \nMETHODS\nTraspain gene was fused to mouse immunoglobulin Kappa  light \nchain signal peptide DNA sequence (SPTrasp) to facilitate extra -\ncellular antigen export upon vaccination. Adenovirus 48 carrying \nSPTrasp gene (Ad48-SPTrasp) was generated using traditional \ncloning and homologous recombination in HEK293 cells. Antigen \nexpression was assessed in-vitro  by RT-PCR and Western blot. \nExploratory immunization experiments were carried out in C57/BL6 \nmice, administering two subcutaneous doses of Ad48-SPTrasp ev -ery 15 days.\nRESULTS\nWe were able to rescue the replication deficient virus and detect \nantigen expression upon 48 hours of in-vitro  infection. Vaccinated \nanimals developed anti-Traspain antibodies (immunized vs control \nanimals ELISA titers: 1782 and 235 respectively) and isotype deter -\nmination indicated an IgG1/IgG2a ratio of 3.4. Robust antigen-spe -\ncific CTL response was detected using tetramer staining (CD8+ \nVNHRLTVL+ cells, immunized: 3.5 % vs control: 0.6 %, p<0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS\nConsidering these results, Ad48-SPTrasp appears as a high poten -\ntial approach for improving the current strategies of vaccine-mediat -\ned control of T. cruzi .\n367. (112) POLYMORPHISM -174 G/C OF THE INTERLEUKIN 6 \nGENE, AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO Toxocara canis IN HU -\nMANS\nAcevedo GA1, Lopez MA1, Bojanich MV2, Medina MG1.\n1. Instituto de Medicina Regional, \u00c1rea Inmunolog\u00eda, Univer -\nsidad Nacional del Nordeste.\n2. Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales y Agrimensura, \nUniversidad Nacional del Nordeste.\nPolymorphisms in the IL6 gene promoter region can give rise to in -\nterindividual variation in the transcription of IL6. Low levels of IL6 \nexpression have been associated with susceptibility to some par -\nasitic diseases. Human infection by Toxocara canis is a zoonosis \ntransmitted by dogs, with a high prevalence in NE Argentina. OB -\nJECTIVE: To investigate the -174 G/C single nucleotide polymor -\nphism (SNP) in the promoter region of the IL-6 gene, related to the \nsusceptibility to Toxocara canis human infection. MATERIALS AND \nMETHODS: The study included 79 patients from Chaco, Argentina \n(without distinction of age or sex) with epidemiological history of ex -\nposure to Toxocara canis. The serological analysis was performed \nusing an indirect ELISA test employing locally obtained secretory/\nexcretory T. canis antigens and peroxidase-labeled anti-human IgG \nserum. The IL6 -174 G/C polimorphism was studied by a nested \npolymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism \n(PCR-RFLP) assay. RESULTS: Of the 79 patients studied, 14 result -\ned positive and 65 were negative for T. canis antibodies. The study \nof the polymorphism genotypes yielded three possible results with \nthe following frequencies: GG: 58.2% (46/79), GC: 38.0% (30/79), \nand CC: 3.8% (3/79). For this sample, no differences between ex -\npected and observed genotype distributions were found. Therefore, \nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium is assumed. There was a significant \ndifference in the distribution of the CC genotype between the se -\nropositive and seronegative groups (14.3% vs 1.5%, respectively; \nOR= 5.12; p=0.02), statistical significance level (p <0.05). CON -\nCLUSION: This study suggests a possible association between the \nIL6 \u2212174 G/C polymorphism and susceptibility to toxokaryosis in \nhumans. Although the number of patients studied is small, the trend \nindicates that the presence of the CC genotype could be associated \nwith increased susceptibility to infection.\n368. (145)  VIRULENCE FACTORS DELIVERED THROUGH \nOUTER MEMBRANE VESICLES SHAPE THE OUTCOME \nOF B. PERTUSSIS- MACROPHAGE INTERACTION\nBlanc\u00e1 B1, Alvarez Hayes J1, Valdez H1, Rodriguez ME1\n1. Laboratorio de microbiolog\u00eda celular y desarrollo de vacu -\nnas, CINDEFI (Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, UNLP - CO -\nNICET)\nThe outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are bi-layer structures natu -\nrally shed by Gram-negative bacteria that usually contain bacterial \nvirulence factors. In previous studies we found that the OMVs of \nBordetella pertussis (Bp), the etiological agent of whopping cough, \nmight influence the outcome of Bp interaction with human M\u03a6. In \nthis study we tried to dissect the bacterial factors involved in this \nprocess. As first approach we determined the proteome of spon -\ntaneously released OMVs. By means of LC-MS/MS we identified \na total of 350 proteins belonging to a wide range of cellular pro -\ncesses. Importantly, most of the Bp virulence factors were found \npresent in these OMVs. Among them, the main bacterial adhesin, ABSTRACTS155\nFHA, and the two main toxins, CyaA and PT. In agreement with the \npresence of FHA, electron and fluorescence microscopy showed \nthat OMVs attached to and are internalized by M\u03a6. As determined \nby flow cytometry, OMVs internalized by M\u03a6 induced a significant \ndecrease in the surface expression of CR3, an effect attributable \nto CyaA according to recently published studies. CR3 is the main \nBp docking molecule on M\u03a6. These results explain the observed \ndecrease of M\u03a6 Bp uptake in the presence of OMVs. We previously \ndemonstrated that CyaA and PT are involved in the modulation of \nbactericidal M\u03a6 response. In this study we observed a similar effect \non M\u03a6 treated with OMVs prior infection, as determined by RT-PCR \n(p<0,05). Accordingly, confocal microscopy studies showed that \nbacterial colocalization with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker \nLAMP-1 was significantly lower in cells preincubated with OMVs, \nas compared with M\u03a6 untreated or treated with OMVs produced by \nBp mutants defective in any of these toxins. Accordingly, bacterial \nsurvival inside M\u03a6 preincubated with OMVs was significantly higher \nthan that observed in untreated M\u03a6. Altogether, these results show \nthat virulence factors delivered through OMVs shape the Bp- M\u03a6 \ninteraction, eventually promoting bacterial persistence.\n369. (201)  Bordetella parapertussis ADENYLATE CYCLASE \nTOXIN MODULATES THE HOST DEFENSE AND INFLAM -\nMATORY RESPONSE ULTIMATELY PROMOTING BACTE -\nRIAL INTRACELLULAR SURVIVAL\nCarrica MC, Gorgojo JP, Valdez HA, Rodr\u00edguez ME\nLaboratorio de microbiolog\u00eda celular y desarrollo de vacunas, \nCINDEFI (Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, UNLP - CONICET)\nB. pertussis  (Bp) and B. parapertussis  (Bpp) are the etiologic agents \nof whooping cough in humans, which is a re-emerging infectious \ndisease. We have previously found that both species survive and \neven replicate inside human macrophages, indicating that these \ncells might serve as a niche for persistence. We further found that \npertussis toxin and adenylate cyclase (CyaA) are involved in the \nintracellular survival of Bp. Bpp expresses solely CyaA, which is the \nmain toxin of this species. Although the genes encoding this toxin in \nBp and Bpp display limited polymorphism, there are studies showing \ndifferent post-translational modifications that eventually lead to less \ncitotoxic Bpp-CyaA, as observed in certain host cells. The aim of \nthis work was to investigate the effect of Bpp-CyaA in macrophage \ndefense response and its eventual role in the non-bactericidal inter -\naction of Bpp with macrophages. To this end, we constructed a Bpp \ndeletion mutant defective in CyaA. The human monocyte cell line \n(THP-1) was differentiated into macrophages and further infected \nwith the mutant or the parental strain. By means of specific markers \nand confocal microscopy for bacterial intracellular trafficking studies \nand antibiotic protection assays, we found that Bpp-CyaA is involved \nin the early stages of macrophage infection, affecting phagocytosis \nand lysosomal maturation promoting intracellular survival. Accord -\ningly, by qRT-PCR assays performed at 3 h p.i., we demonstrated \nthat Bpp-CyaA down-regulates the transcription of genes encoding \nantimicrobial peptides, proteins involved in enzymatic or oxidative \ndefense mechanisms, and the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1, \nwhile it up-regulates the transcription of anti-inflammatory cytokine \nIL-10. All the data were statistically significant with p<0.05 ana -\nlyzed by one-way ANOVA. Taking together, the results suggest that \nBpp-CyaA is active in macrophages and plays a relevant role in the \nbacterial intracellular survival by modulating host defense response.\n370.

Laboratorio de microbiolog\u00eda celular y desarrollo de vacu -\nnas, CINDEFI (Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, UNLP - CO -\nNICET)\nWhooping cough is a reemerging disease caused by Bordetella \npertussis (Bp). Current vaccines are protective against symptoms \nbut fail to prevent colonization and transmission, which resulted in \npathogen persistence. We have previously found that Bp survives \ninside phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, suggesting that an in -tracellular stage might be important for persistence. The aim of this \nstudy was to evaluate whether Bp compromises the epithelial barrier \nand uses it as an intracellular niche. To this end, human 16HBE14o- \ncells were used as polarized in vitro  model. After 7 days of differen -\ntiation, functional tight junctions were formed, as verified by means \nof specific antibodies and fluorescence microscopy. We developed \na subconfluent model in which cells exposed apical and basolat -\neral membranes, allowing the study of Bp interaction with both of \nthem. Bacterial attachment and internalization were quantified by \nfluorescence microscopy at 5h post-infection. The results showed \nthat Bp has a tropism for the basolateral membrane, in which most \nof the attachment and internalization was observed. Confocal mi -\ncroscopy analysis showed that a high percentage of internalized \nbacteria avoided phagolysosomal fusion. Antibiotic protection as -\nsays confirmed a high survival inside these cells at late time points \n(48h) post-infection, suggesting that epithelial cells might constitute \na niche of persistence for this pathogen. Adenylate cyclase toxin \n(CyaA), a virulence factor released by Bp both in its soluble form and \ninside outer membrane vesicles (OMV), was found involved in tight \njunction disruption. We recently found that Bp OMVs preferentially \nattach to polarized respiratory cells near tight junctions. This might \nfacilitate CyaA delivery to these sites, eventually granting Bp access \nto the basolateral membrane during infection. Furthermore, these \nresults also suggest that the respiratory epithelium might have been \nunderestimated as a persistence intracellular niche.\n371.

Virulence factors play a key role in bacterial per -\nsistence inside the host cell. Transcription of Bp virulence factors are \ncontrolled by the interrelated two-component systems BvgAS and \nRisAS. The participation of additional regulatory systems in this pro -\ncess is not clear. The aim of this work was to characterize the con -\ntribution of the BP1092 protein, a two-component system histidine \nkinase overexpressed intracellularly, in virulence factor regulation \nand intracellular survival.\nTo this end, we constructed a Bp deletion mutant defective in \nBP1092 (BP\u03941092) and analysed the differential expression of \nvirulence factors representative of the virulent ( fhaB), intermedi -\nate ( bipA), and avirulent ( vraA, kpsE ) phases by qRT-PCR under \nstandard (SS medium) and modulating conditions (SS medium + 50 \nmM). We showed that Bp\u03941092, unlike the parental strain (wt), was \nunable to downregulate fha and bipA expression in bacteria growing \nunder modulating conditions, suggesting that this protein is involved \nin the transition to the avirulent phase. Accordingly, by mean of mi -\ncrotiter crystal violet assay, we showed that under modulating condi -\ntions Bp\u03941092, but not the WT strain, was able to form a biofilm, a \nway of lifestyle mainly dependent of  fhaB  expression. Interestingly, \nmicroscopy and antibiotic protection assays, showed that the lack of \nexpression of BP1092 resulted in a decreased survival of Bp inside \nmacrophages. This result suggests that early events of the intracel -\nlular survival depend on BP1092 expression. All the data presented \nhere were statistically significant with p<0.05 analysed by one-way \nANOVA.\nThis work reveals a new level of complexity of the virulence regula -\ntions of Bp. Elucidating the role of BP1092 in the regulation of Bp vir-\nulence might shed some light on the poorly understood pathogene -\nsis of these bacteria.\n372.

We used \nNEB RT-LAMP kit in simplex or duplex formats, plus a RT-LAMP \nfor sample integrity control, using RNAs from RT-PCR tested naso -\npharyngeal swabs and synthetic viral RNAs. ii) LOD95 was calcu -\nlated for duplex RT-LAMP tests following FDA and WHO COVID-19 \nguidelines, using a quantified SARS-CoV-2 positive RNA control \n(GISAID EPI_ISL_420600) isolated from a local viral strain cultured \nin Vero cells, and quantified against a WHO SARS-CoV-2 standard. \niii) RT-LAMP visualization was done by naked eye and by a mobile \napp. Strips were photographed using a simple capture device with \nvisual references to standardize strip-tubes positions, focus and \nlight intensity, and colour analysis was implemented by computer \nvision techniques. iv) a blind panel of RNAs from 20 qPCR positive \nand 21 qPCR negative samples was tested. Positivity was visual -\nized by colour change between 30-40 min. of incubation at 65\u00b0C. \nKappa agreement between RT-LAMP and RT-PCR was estimated.\nRESULTS LOD95 of selected duplex RT-LAMPS (ORF+N, N+S and \nS+ORF) ranged between 12.5-15 RNA copies/reaction. The mobile \nphone app reported correctly photographs of tested strips in accor -\ndance with naked-eye visualization and reporting.  All 41 swabs were \nRNASeP-RT-LAMP positive. Maximum Kappa indexes between \nRT-LAMP and RT-PCR were excellent: 0.902 for ORF+S at 30 min \n(95% Se&Sp) and 0.804 for S+N at 30 min and ORF+N at 40 min \n(80%Se,100%Sp). \nCONCLUSIONS Optimization of rapid RNA extraction methods from \nclinical samples and prospective blind-based evaluation is a next \nstep towards validating these tools for point-of-care COVID-19 di -\nagnosis. \n373.

Hospital Cetrangolo.\nTuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health problem and is the \nsecond leading cause of death from infectious diseases worldwide. \nRegarding TB immunity, the most important response has been at -\ntributed to T cells, with CD4+ T cells playing a crucial role both for \nthe control of infection and the tissue damage. And, although TH1 \nlymphocytes are essential to control TB infection, other lympho -\ncytes, such as TH22, would participate in this response. IL-22 acts \non the mucous membrane promoting tissue repair or inflammatory \nprocesses. During TB, CD4+ T cells can evolve to effector cells with \nmembrane-bound IL-22 (Mb-IL-22) inhibiting M. tuberculosis (Mtb) \nreplication into macrophages. Besides, the genetic variability of \nMtb could influence immune response. The aim of the study was to \nexplore the TH22 response induced by different Mtb strains during \nactive pulmonary TB. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB, n: 59), drug-suscep -\ntible TB (S-TB, n: 27) and healthy donors (HD, n: 20). Peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultured alone \nor with \u03b3-irradiated Mtb strains. IL-22 secretion was measured from \nplasma and culture supernatants by ELISA while intracellular IL-22 \n(ic-IL-22) and Mb-IL-22 levels as well as senescent T cells markers, \nCD57 and PD-1, were determined by flow cytometry. IL-22 T cells \nexpression was higher in S-TB than in MDR-TB and HD despite \nthe strain employed as antigen. Plasma IL-22 levels in TB patients \nwere lower than in HD. Besides, in MDR-TB patients, the greater the \nbacillary load and the severity of the lesion, the lower IL-22 expres -\nsion in T cells and IL-22 secretion by stimulated PBMC. In addition, \nCD57+ and PD1+ T cells were markedly increased in MDR-TB pa -\ntients and inversely correlated with IL-22 expression, reflecting that \nT cell exhaustion could lead to a deficient of the host to mount ad -\nequate TH22 responses, decrease bacterial load and mount tissue \nrepair mechanisms.\n374.

In inflammatory microenvironments, \nexogenous ATP (eATP) is hydrolyzed to adenosine, which exerts im -\nmunosuppressive effects, by the consecutive action of the ectonu -\ncleotidases CD39 and CD73. Mature B cells constitutively express \nboth ectonucleotidases, converting these cells to potential suppres -\nsors. Here, we assessed CD39 and CD73 expression on B cells \nfrom treated or untreated patients with RA. Neither the frequency of \nCD73+CD39+ and CD73-CD39+ B cell subsets nor the levels of CD73 \nand CD39 expression on B cells from untreated or treated RA pa -\ntients showed significant changes in comparison to healthy controls \n(HC). CpG+IL-2-stimulated B cells from HC or untreated RA patients \nincreased their CD39 expression, and suppressed CD4+ and CD8+ \nT cell proliferation and intracellular TNF-production. A CD39 inhibi -\ntor significantly restored proliferation and TNF-producing capacity in \nCD4+ T cells, but not in CD8+ T cells, from HC and untreated RA pa -\ntients, indicating that B cells from untreated RA patients conserved \nCD39-mediated regulatory function. Good responder patients to \ntherapy (R-RA) exhibited an increased CD39 but not CD73 expres -\nsion on B cells after treatment, while most of the non-responder \n(NR) patients showed a reduction in ectoenzyme expression. The \npositive changes of CD39 expression on B cells exhibited a negative \ncorrelation with disease activity and rheumatoid factor levels. Our \nresults suggest modulating ectoenzymes/ADO pathway as a poten -\ntial therapy target for improving the course of RA.\n375.

Although CLL patients usually \nhave low serum levels of IgG, IgM and IgA, most standard immuno -\nglobulin (Ig) preparations contain > 95% of IgG. Pentaglobin is an Ig \npreparation of intravenous application (IVIg) enriched with IgM and \nIgA, with the potential benefit to restore Ig levels of all isotypes. Be -\ncause standard IVIg preparations have well-documented immuno -\nmodulatory effects, we aimed to evaluate the effect of Pentaglobin \n(IVIgGMA) and a standard IVIg preparation (IVIgG) on leukemic and \nT cells from CLL patients.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients were used. \nT and B cell activation, induced by immobilized anti-CD3 mAb or \nanti-IgM mAb respectively, was evaluated by flow cytometry (FC). \nT cell proliferation in response to anti-CD3 mAb or IL-15 was deter -\nmined by FC using the CFSE dilution assay. We also evaluated by \nFC the effect of IVIg preparations on T and B cell apoptosis induced \nby the BCL-2 inhibitor used for CLL treatment, venetoclax. Experi -\nments were done in presence of IVIgG, IVIgGMA or HSA (ct). \nWe found that IVIgG impaired CD25, CD69 and PD-1 expression \n(n=9, p<0.05) on activated T cells, while IVIgGMA did not. Both \npreparations decreased T cell proliferation in response to TCR/CD3 \nstimulation (n=11, p<0.05), whereas only IVIgG, impaired prolifer -\nation induced by IL-15 (n=15, p<0.05). Regarding leukemic B cell \nactivation, CD69 and CD86 (n=15, p<0.05) expression on activated \nB cells was similarly decreased by both preparations. Finally, IVIg -\nGMA but not IVIgG, decreased venetoclax-induced T cell apoptosis \n(n=9, p<0.05) without impairing venetoclax-induced leukemic cells \napoptosis.\nOur results add new data on the effects of different preparations of \nIVIg in CLL and show that the IVIgGMA preparation not only impairs \nleukemic cell activation, but also has a particular profile of immu -\nnomodulatory effects on T cells that deserves further investigation.\n376.

CIBICI (CONICET) \nFacultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas-UNC, C\u00f3rdoba, ARGENTINA\nAzithromycin (AZM) is a widely used antibiotic, with additional an -\ntiviral and anti-inflammatory properties not well understood yet. It \nbelongs to the family of macrolide antibiotics and is approved world -\nwide to treat community-acquired infections. AZM is widely distrib -\nuted in tissues and body fluids. Although short-term treatment re -\nsults in decrease of richness, diversity and taxonomic composition \nof the gut microbiota, long-term effects are unknown. The impact \nof acute administration of AZM in drinking water (50 mg/kg/day/5 \ndays) was evaluated in lymphocyte (L) subsets and cytokine mi -\ncroenvironment of mesenteric lymph nodes draining small intestine \n(SI) and colon (C) of 3 mouse strains: C57BL76, Per2KO (clock \ngene KO) and Foxp3-GFP. Using flow cytometry, we determined \nfrequency (%) and absolute number (#) of CD3+L and CD19+L in \nadult male and female hosts. In C56BL6 males, no differences were \nobserved between control and treated groups. In Per2KO males the \n% of CD3+L decreased in SI and C (p<0.001) and the % and # of \nCD19+L increased in SI and C (p<0.05) without differences in fe -\nmales. In C of Foxp3-GFP females, decrease of %CD3+L (p <0.05) \nand increase of %CD19+L occurred (p<0.001), while males showed \nincrease in # CD19+L in SI (p<0.05). We also evaluated the % of \nFoxp3+, CD49b+ and FOXp3+ CD49b+ regulatory L in Foxp3-GFP \nmice. Both male and female animals showed a reduction in reg -\nulatory subsets that was more pronounced in C of female and SI \nof male mice (p<0.05). In terms of microenvironment, we assessed \nIL-6 and IL-10 by ELISA. We found that the concentration of cyto -\nkines depended on the strain (p<0.05), although no differences were \nobserved between control and treated animals. Our results show \ninteresting differences in AZM effects related to anatomical location, \nstrain, and sex. These differences suggest that sex is an important \nfactor to consider for future evaluations of intestinal activity not only for AZM but also for other drugs administered orally.\n377.

Evaluation of novel and rare CARD11  variants in \npatients with PID is needed to characteri ze their functional impact.\nOur aim is to determine  the functional relevance of heterozygous \nCARD11  variants identified  in pediatric PID patients treated in Hos -\npital Garrahan. In this work we further analyse  three novel variants \nin CARD11 p.T117P , p.E96K and p.R818Q, and two previously \nreported pathogenic mutations p.R30W  (LOF/DN) and  p.G123S \n(GOF) carried  by five unrelated Argentinean patients. \nTo evaluate signalling and function of CARD11, transfection of the \ndifferent mutant CARD11  constructs into HEK293T, Jurkat and \nJPM50.6 was performed. Our results showed that p.T117P drive to \na GOF activity of the protein, p.E96K resulted in LOF/DN activity, \nwhile p.R818Q behaved similar to CARD11 wild type (WT) in a het -\nerozygous transfection assay upon antigen receptor-induced activa -\ntion of NF-\u03baB. The results of immunofluorescence assays showed \nthat both the GOF mutation p.G123S and the novel variant p.T117P \ncaused multimeric aggregation of CARD11 in cytoplasmic complex -\nes in absence of stimuli which were previously described as indica -\ntive of active signaling. This unique aggregation from GOF CARD11  \nmutants may collaborate with future clinical management .\nThe identification of novel CARD11  mutations in PID patients along \nwith th e broad range of clinical manifestations point out the necessi -\nty for ava ilable  functional studies validat ing their potential pathogen -\nic outcome  and contribut ing to further understanding the mechanism \nthat underlies the development of the disease.\n378.

In our lab, we identified a population of \nEF-ASC (B220intCD138+Blimp-1+, Plasmablasts/PB) characterized \nby high expression of PD-L1 and CD39, present in murine infection \nmodels but not in autoimmunity or immunizations.

Therefore, B6 mice were infected with T. cruzi  and splenic, \nlymph node and bone marrow (BM) lymphocytes were evaluated by \nFACS at different days post infection (dpi). The 99% of splenic PB \nexpressed high levels of PD-L1 and CD39 until day 23pi and this fre -\nquency was significantly reduced from day 28pi (p<0.005). Only the \n15% of BM-ASC from mice in the chronic phase of infection (130dpi) \nexpressed high levels of PD-L1 and CD39. Splenic PD-L1hiCD-\n39hi PB also expressed high levels of CXCR4, MHCII, CD80, CD86 \nand Ki-67 and produced IL-21, IL-6 and IL-10, probably conditioning \nT-helper response. In addition, we found CXCR5+ and CXCR5negP-\nD1+ICOS+Bcl-6+CD4+Tcell populations in spleen of infected mice, \nwhich produce TNF, IFN\u03b3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-21, probably sustaining PB \nresponse since infected Bcl-6flo/floCD23Cre mice did not exhibit this \nASC population.

Basic and Applied Immunological Research Center (CI -\nNIBA), School of Medical Science, National University of La \nPlata, La Plata, Argentina.\nPregnancy is an intriguing state of double compromise where mater -\nnal immune system must undergo certain adaptations to tolerate the \nsemiallogeneic fetus and fight pathogens. B cells are key compo -\nnents of the adaptive immunity, responsible for humoral immune re -\nsponse. There is solid evidence that pregnancy induces strong mod -\nifications in B cell development and function. Hence, our aim was to \ncharacterize the transcriptomic profile of B cells during pregnancy in \nmice. We performed a genome-wide transcriptome profiling on iso -\nlated splenic B cells from pregnant (P) and non-pregnant (NP) mice. \nWe identified 1136 genes with differential expression in B cells from \nP mice compared to NP animals (\u22481.5-2fold changes, Limma eBayes \ntest, p<0.0001, n=4). For biological interpretation we performed a \nfunctional enrichment analysis with InnateDB source (http://www.in -\nnatedb.com/). Significantly over-represented (ORA) gene ontology \n(GO) terms and biological pathways showed up-regulation on DNA \nreplication and cell cycle nodes, while down-regulated genes were \ngrouped into an immune response node (hypergeometric algorithm: \nFC>1.5; BH multiple test correction:p<0.05,FDR<0.05). Within the \nimmune response node, B cell activation, antigen processing and \npresentation, B cell differentiation, cytokine and TLR mediated sig -\nnaling pathways were downregulated in B cells from P compared \nto NP mice (p<0.05). Diminished mRNA expression levels of key \ngenes implicated on these processes were confirmed by qPCR (Un -\npaired-t-test, one-tailed,p<0.05,n=8). Differential mRNA  expression \npattern could traduce in a diminished capacity of B cells to differenti -\nate, proliferate, and to produce cytokines and antibodies in response \nto antigens. Our results strongly suggest that B cells acquire a state \nof hyporesponsiveness during pregnancy, most probably to tolerate \nthe semi-allogeneic fetus. However, this could also break new paths \nfor understanding why pregnant women are at higher risk for certain \ninfections.\n380.

We have previously demonstrated \nthat these tonsils present a defective Breg compartment. Here, \nwe extend those findings by evidencing the inflammatory cytokine \npattern of tonsillar mononuclear cells (TMC) and investigating the \ngrounds of such profile. OSAS TMC were the only cells used for this \nwork. We showed the ability of Bcs to promote the loss of immune \nhomeostatic control by promptly producing TNF\u03b1. Using FACS, we \ndetermined TNF\u03b1 production by stimulated TMC in culture. Upon 24 \nhours, Bcs represented the majority of TNF\u03b1+ cells (52,4% \u00b1 SEM \n4,2% CD20+/down cells vs 41,7% \u00b1 SEM 4,0% CD3+ cells, p < 0.05). \nConversely, at the same time point, IL17 was produced primarily by \nCD4+ T cells (Th17) which comprised 90% of the IL17+ population. \nAlso at 24 hs post stimulation, two thirds of the Th17 population \n(59% \u00b1 SEM 4%) co-expressed TNF\u03b1. Despite the pro-inflammatory \nprofile displayed by TMC in culture, OSAS has long been consid -\nered of non-infectious etiology. We cultured the core tonsillar tissue \nof 31 children and identified 89 bacterial species by MALDI-TOF \nMS. The species identified had been previously found either causing \nENT pathology or as harmless local flora, both situations in com -\npetent hosts. Pathogens differ from commensals in being able to \npenetrate the epithelial barriers. Hence, we performed fluorescence \nin situ hybridization (FISH) with a universal eubacterial (EUB338) \nprobe followed by immune-fluorescence staining, on cryo-sections \nfrom excised tonsils. By confocal microscopy, we confirmed bacteri -\nal presence within the lymphoid compartment from OSAS biopsies. \nTo conclude, while we cannot ascertain that the microorganisms de -\ntected in situ  as well as through culture are the initiators of the ongo -\ning inflammatory response characteristic of OSAS, the chronification \nof the process must be related to the evidenced bacterial spreading \nbeyond the normal boundaries.\n381.

Mice were subcutaneously immunized with a sin -\ngle-dose of OVA and CpG-ODN nanoformulated with Coa-ASC16 \n(OCC), with OVA and CpG-ODN in solution (OC) prepared to room \ntemperature (RT), with OVA and CpG-ODN solution heated and then \ncooled down to RT (OC\u00f8), with OVA solution heated and then cooled ABSTRACTS159\ndown to RT plus CpG-ODN solution at RT (O\u00f8/C), with OVA solution \nat RT plus CpG-ODN solution heated and then cooled down to RT \n(O/C\u00f8). Heating and cooling processes recreated the conditions of \nthe nanoformulation preparation. On the 160th day of post-immuni -\nzation (pi), mice were intraperitoneally challenged with OVA/CpG-\nODN and sacrificed 7 days later. OVA-anti IgG titers (ELISA) and \nsplenocytes by flow cytometry were evaluated. When antigens at \nthe injection site were measured, the formulations were prepared \nusing fluorescent-dye labeled OVA and in vivo scanning of mice \nwas performed on Odyssey\u00aeCLx. OCC induced IgG titers higher \nthan OC\u00f8 and O\u00f8/C at 145 day pi (p<0.001). Post challenged (day \n167), OCC IgG titers were comparable to OC\u00f8 group and higher to \nO\u00f8/C group (p<0.01). O/C\u00f8 failed to generate OVA-specific IgG. At \n167 days pi, OCC generated higher OVA-specific (CD3-F480- CD19+ \nIgM- IgD- IgG+ GL7- CD38+ OVA+) memory and germinal center (CD3- \nF480- CD19+ IgM- IgD- IgG+ GL7+ CD38- OVA+) B cells (p<0.05) than \nthe other formulations. In OCC group, the OVA fluorescence signal \nin the injection site was higher than in the other groups since 0.3 \n(p<0.0001) until 12 days pi (p<0.01). Our results show that the nano -\nstructure improve the memory response and induce antigen depot \nat the injection site.\n382.

However, the role of prolactin receptor (PRL-R) \nin autoimmune development is still controversial. The aim of this \nwork is to analyze the expression of PRL-R in murine immune cells, \nand determine whether PRL-R are modulated during activation \nwith Concanavalin A (conA) and suppression with Dexamethasone \n(dexa) in healthy mice and three mice models for Lupus. For this \nend, splenocytes from C57BL/6 (C57), and lupic FcgRIIb KO (RIIb), \nNZM, and MRL/MpJ-Faslpr (FAS) mice were stimulated with 1 \u00b5g/ml \nof conA or 1 \u00b5g/ml dexa and kept in culture for 24 hours. RNA from \nsplenocytes was isolated using Trizol and retrotranscribed to cDNA \nto detect PRL-RL by qPCR. Protein determination was carried out \nby flow cytometry using Anti-CD4, Anti-CD19, and Anti-PRL-R. We \nfound that splenocytes from RIIb mice have higher mRNA of PRL-RL \nexpression than other strains. In CD4+ T cells from C57 mice PRL-R \nincreased by suppression with dexa and did no changes when stim -\nulated with conA. In contrast, in CD4+ T cells from FAS mice, PRL-R \nincreased after conA and decreased with dexa, while the CD4+ T \ncells from RIIb and NZM mice displayed no changes. In CD19+ \nB cells from C57 and FAS mice, we observed an increase of total \nPRL-R when we stimulated with dexa and no changes with conA, \nwhile in CD19+ from RIIb and NZM mice, did not display changes.  \nThese results show a differential behavior of PRL-R expression in \nC57 mice compared with the lupic mice after stimulation with conA \nand dexa. The fact that C57 displayed low levels of PRL-R during \nactivation but high in suppression gives us the notion that PRL-R \nmay contribute to maintaining a cellular immune balance by limiting \nPRL trophic effects. By contrast, the high levels of PRL-R during ac -\ntivation in FAS mice suggest an exacerbated trophic effect of PRL. \nOur data show that differential PRL-R expression in immune cells \nmay contribute to regulate the immune response.\n383.

The aim \nof this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of oral \nadministration of M. verticillata  EO in a murine model. Male Bal -\nb/c mice (n=9) were divided in three groups and administered orally \nby gavage once a day for 10 consecutive days as follows: Con -\ntrol group 100 \u00b5l of saline solution (ClNa 0.9%), Treatment 1 (T1) \ngroup 100 \u00b5l of EO (5 mg/kg/day) and Treatment 2 (T2) group 100 \n\u00b5l of EO (10 mg/kg/day). Body weight, fecal consistency and fecal \noccult blood were evaluated as important indicators of intestinal \nhealth. The blood parameters were evaluated trough total and dif -\nferential leukocyte count in peripheral blood. At the end of the assay \nmice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and spleens were col -\nlected for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells quantification by flow cytometry. \nAn increase in the body weight gain was observed in T1 group com -\npared to the control and T2 groups (p<0.05). No difference was ob -\nserved in diarrhea scores among treatments neither damage in the \ndigestive system evidenced by the absence of fecal occult blood in \nall groups. T1 and T2 groups showed  an increase in total leuko -\ncyte count compared to the control group (p<0.05). The leukocyte \nformula revealed that lymphocytes percentage were significantly \nhigher in T2 group compared to control group (p<0.05). The num -\nber of CD4+ T cells in splenic tissue were significantly higher  in T1 \nand T2 groups compared to control group (p<0.05). The number of \nCD8+ T cells was not altered in mice treated with EO. These results \nindicated that oral administration of M. verticillata  EO was safe and \nmodulates the systemic adaptive cellular immunity in mice through \npositive regulation of T cells subsets. Further studies will need to be \ncarried out to elucidate whether this natural product could be used \nas an immunomodulatory food additive.\n384.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the functionality of the \nspecific antibodies produced and to quantify the IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 \ncytokines. Balb/c mice (n=4 per group) were inoculated by subcu -\ntaneous injection (days 0, 14 and 28) as follows: Group 1: 100 \u00b5l \nsaline solution; Group 2: 100 \u00b5l bacterin+EO (2.5 mg/ml); Group 3: \n100 \u00b5l bacterin+ microcapsule wall material (2.5 mg/ml); Group 4: \n100 \u03bcl bacterin+EOMC (5 mg/ml). In all groups, bacterin was of E. \nfaecium. Seven days after the last booster, blood was obtained and \nserum was separated. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation \nand spleens were removed to obtain splenic lymphocytes for cell \nproliferation assay. To evaluate the functionality of the antibodies, \nthe Opsonophagocytic Killing Assay was carried out using different \ndilutions of the sera (1/100, 1/200, 1/500, 1/1000, 1/2000), E. fae -\ncium (1x107 CFU/ml), bovine PMNs (1x107cells/ml) suspensions \nand a source of bovine complement.

IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 were \nquantified in the culture supernatants by sandwich ELISA. Higher \nlevels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 were detected in lymphocyte culture super -\nnatants of Group 2 compared to other groups (p<0.001). In Group 2, \nIFN-\u03b3 levels were higher than IL-4 (p<0.001), indicating that the ac -\ntivation of CD4+ T cells by the vaccine formulation containing alone \nEO may result in a Th1 profile. The results obtained confirm that \nEO and EOMC activate humoral and cellular immunity and could be \ncandidates for vaccine adjuvants.\n385.

Centro de Virolog\u00eda Animal (CEVAN), Instituto de Ciencia \ny Tecnolog\u00eda Dr. C\u00e9sar Milstein. CONICET, CABA, Argentina.\nIn addition to classical antibodies (Abs), the adaptive immune sys -\ntem of camelids comprises heavy-chain only antibodies (HCAb), \nwhere antigen-binding is mediated exclusively by one variable do -\nmain. These single domains are the smallest functional Abs, known \nas VHH or nanobodies (Nbs). Due to their inherent favorable attri -\nbutes, such as high affinity and specificity for their antigen, easy \ncloning and small size, VHH have great potential for diagnostic, ther -\napeutic and biotechnological applications. Thus, Nbs are used as \nprotein purification ligands because of their high stability, monomeric \nnature, and easy directional immobilization to solid supports. For \nthis reason, our aim was to characterize VHH against murine IgG1 \n(mIgG1) to be used as ligands in a new affinity chromatography \nmethod to purify conventional monoclonal Abs (mAbs). To achieve \nour goal, two immune VHH libraries were previously constructed \nstarting from llama blood, and specific Nbs against mIgG1 were se -\nlected by Phage Display methodology. Moreover, 9 out of the 24 \nmost reactive selected VHH were confirmed as unique by sequenc -\ning. In this work, these Nbs were expressed as soluble protein in  E. \ncoli WK6 strain. Later, 4 of these VHH were purified from periplasmic \nextract by IMAC. Reactivity of these soluble-expressed Nbs against \nmIgG1 was confirmed by ELISA and Western Blot (WB). Also, the \nreactivity against IgGs from other species was evaluated by Dot Blot \nand WB. Moreover, all these VHH were able to successfully bind \nand immunoprecipitate IgG from mouse sera and ascites. In conclu -\nsion, we have characterized four specific VHH expressed as soluble \nprotein, which showed high reactivity against mIgG1 in ELISA and \nWB as expected. All of them were able to recognize their target in a \nbiological protein mixture. Even more, two of them were highly spe -\ncific for only murine IgG. Further characterization of these Nbs will \nallow us to develop a new VHH-based method of mAb purification \nwith potential advantages.\n386.

Long-\nterm excretors could reintroduce mutated polioviruses with in -\ncreased neurovirulence into the general circulation. Treatments \nsuch as pocapavir can reduce environmental spread.\nObjective: To present clinical behavior of a patient with uncharacter -\nized immunodeficiency and chronic poliovirus infection. \nClinical case: A two-year-old female patient, term newborn, daugh -\nter of healthy non-consanguineous parents, without relevant family \nhistory is hospitalized at 9 months old due to a left brachiocrural \nhemiparesis. She is evaluated by Neurology who assumes acute \ndisseminated encephalomyelitis and prescribes methylprednisolone \nand EV gammaglobulin. The patient responds favorably so she is \ndischarged. \nAfter 3 months, she is referred to Immunology for evaluation. Inmu -nological screening shows undosable IgA and IgM, IgG 228mg/dl. \nLymphocyte subpopulations CD3 77% CD4 48% CD8 27% CD19 \n15% NK 8%. Subpopulations B Naive 98.9%, memory without \nchange of isotype 1.04%. Absent plasma cells. Blood group 0+. Iso -\nhaemaglutinins anti A and anti B absent. Ac HBs non-reactive. Un -\ncharacterized humoral immunodeficiency is assumed so EV gamma \nglobulin is initiated. The patient had received sabin at 6 months old \nso samples are sent to Malbran Institute to rule out vaccine\u00b4s sec -\nondary infection, obtaining positive result for sabin 3 postvaccinal \nserotype. Actually the patient continues fecal viral shedding wich \npresents 30 mutations. Compassionate use of pocapavir is attempt -\ned but cannot be imported. Samples are sent to NIH in the United \nStates for mutation testing. \nConclusions: Our case explain chronic poliovirus infection in a \npatient with humoral immunodeficiency. We consider important to \nprovide an antiviral treatment wich stops the environmental spread \nof the virus, because it has suffered numerous mutations that can \nconstitute a serious epidemiological risk.\n387.

The wide diversity of factors and associated variables \nstudied over the last 3 decades in the context of IBD has challenged \nour ability to integrate the empirical information available in humans. \nThus, our goal was to quantitatively analyze how representativeness \nof components of different functional levels and their interactions \nhave changed over the last 30 years of IBD research in humans. \nA bibliographic search in Pubmed was performed aimed at extract -\ning experimental studies on IBD in humans published between July \n1990 and June 2020. This resulted in 25971 valid abstracts. A search \nfor 1380 specific variables in these abstracts was conducted auto -\nmatically using customized code in Matlab. The selection of these \nvariables was based on recent reviews and, genetic and molecular \ncatalogues. Publications showed a 5-fold annual rate increase from \n1990 to the present. Representativeness of molecular and cellular \ncomponents remained relatively constant over time, while genes \nshowed a peak increase in publications between 1990 and 2005, \nwith an increasing diversity of genes studied. Microbiota-sensing re -\nlated variables showed a constant increase in publications.

These components appear \nas integrative nodes in the network of variables involved in the man -\nifestation of IBD. Our quantitative analysis with historical perspective \nsupports the need to comprehend IBD as the resultant of an inter -\nactome or \u2018network effect\u2019.

Children with T21 have a \nunique disease spectrum with increased incidence of obstructive \nsleep apnea, tonsil hypertrophy, susceptibility to autoimmunity, a \nsevere reduction in switched memory B cells and poor response \nto vaccination (Farroni et al., 2018; www.ndss.org). Since follicular \nhelper T cells (Tfh) facilitate B-cell activation and differentiation, \nwe studied Tfh cells in tonsils obtained from two children with T21 \nwhose tonsils were extracted due to hypertrophy and two age-\nmatched controls, one of them with recurrent tonsillitis and the other \nwith hypertrophy. We performed immunohistochemistry and multi -\nparametric flow cytometry to characterize the different subsets. Our \npreliminary data indicate that the diameters of follicles in T21 tonsils \nwere reduced compared to controls (~500 vs 700 \u00b5m). The frequen -\ncies of CD19+ and CD3+ cells among the total tonsil CD45+ cell \npopulation were not modified in T21 samples. The frequency of the \nCD3+ PD1high population, associated with germinal center Tfh, was \nreduced compared to age matched controls (27% vs 36%). Also, the \nfrequency of CD3+ PD1int was increased in T21 tonsils (38% vs 28%). \nThe expression of the activation marker CD38, measured as mean \nfluorescence intensity (MFI), is reduced in both CD3+ population \n(MFI-CD38PD1int = 2066 vs 3037; MFI-CD38PD1hi = 5393 vs 8454). We \nalso analyzed the frequencies of the different B cell populations de -\ntermined by the expression of CD19, CD27, CD24 and CD38 mark -\ners and we observed an increase in the CD19+ CD38highCD24high cell \npopulation, associated with a transitional phenotype (3,1% vs 1,6%).  \nOur results open new avenues to keep on investigating the B and \nTfh response in children with Down Syndrome. \n389. (351) THE USE OF SPECIFIC HISTAMINE RECEPTOR 4 \nANTAGONIST REDUCES INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE \nIN ALLERGY\nAlcain J, Coronel V, Salamone G, Vermeulen M\nIMEX (CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina ), Buenos \nAires, Argentina\nNon classical CD8 T lymphocytes are poorly studied in allergic pro -\ncesses. However, it has been shown that they play an important role \nin diseases such as asthma. CD8 T cells are resistant to steroids \n(the preferred therapy for asthma), and a subset of these cells can \nproduce type 2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-13) that perpetuate the immune \nresponse. Our group has previously shown in a mouse model  of \nasthma that the instillation of histamine treated DCs exacerbates \nTh2/Tc2 type immune response, and that this can be partially re -\nverted with the use of the H3R/H4R antagonist Thioperamide. In \nthe present work we focus on the role of H4R in this effect, using \na highly specific H4R antagonist, JNJ7777120 (JNJ). We generat -\ned the murine OVA allergy model using two intramuscular doses of \nOVA/AlOH (concentraci\u00f3n) in a sensitization phase, and 5 consec -\nutive daily intranasal OVA 3% instillation as a challenge. On day 1 \nof the challenge, mice were also intranasally inoculated with bone \nmarrow derived DCs (BMDCs) treated or not with HIS (10-6M) and \nJNJ7777120 (10-5M). Two weeks after day 1 of challenge, mice were \nsacrificed and the lungs obtained, processed and analyzed. We \nfound that, whereas no significant differences were found in IL-13 \nproduction, another Th2/Tc2 type cytokine, such as IL-5, was sig -\nnificantly reduced, especially in CD8+ T cells. We also found an in -\ncrease in IL10 production in mononuclear CD11c+ cells. This could \nindicate that JNJ generates an anti inflammatory milieu that helps \nreduce cytokine production. We have observed a similar effect on a murine model of allergic dermatitis, where JNJ increases IL-10 \nlevels and decreases Th2 cytokines and T cell proliferation. These \nresults suggest that JNJ effect on type 2 immunity is conserved ac -\ncross allergic pahologies.\n390.

Ugalde\u201d, IIBIO (UNSAM-CONICET), Universidad Nacional \nde San Mart\u00edn, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nAllergies are T helper 2 immune responses mediated by IgE, in -\nduced by an antigen called allergen. Many allergens are proteases; \nthus, allergy models were developed using cysteine proteases like \npapain.\nAt our laboratory we had demonstrated the potential of U-Omp19 \nas an adjuvant in vaccine formulations against infectious diseases \ninducing a Th1 response. Therefore, the main objective of this work \nwas to evaluate its potential to modulate allergic responses. \nTo this end an allergy model induced by papain was performed at \nour laboratory. Mice (n=5/group) were subcutaneously immunized \nwith OVA, OVA+papain or OVA+papain+U-Omp19. The antibody re -\nsponse was assessed by analyzing anti-OVA IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a \nin serum by indirect ELISA. The specific cellular immune response \nwas also measured, analyzing the levels of cytokines associated \nwith a Th2 response (IL-5 and IL-13) in OVA-stimulated splenocyte \nsupernatants by ELISA.\nOur results indicate that the allergic response was induced when \nmice were immunized with OVA plus papain. In this group, we have \nfound a significant increase in anti-OVA IgE levels (p <0.05, ANO -\nVA + Bonferroni Test), and a specific OVA Th2 response, given the \nsignificant increases in IL-5 and IL-13 levels (p <0.01 for IL-5 and \np<0.001 for IL-13, ANOVA + Bonferroni Test), compared to the ad -\nministration of OVA alone. In contrast, when U-Omp19 was added to \nthe formulation, anti-OVA IgE levels were modulated or not elicited \nand were similar to levels induced by OVA delivered alone group. \nBesides, the T helper 2 cytokines production were not induced. \nTogether our results using a model of allergic disease constitute a \nproof of concept that indicates that U-Omp19 is capable of prevent -\ning/modulating the papain induced allergic response.  This work \npaves the way of future research on the immunomodulatory poten -\ntial of U-Omp19 in allergic responses.\n391.

V), 2020162\nF+rhIL-4 for 5 days in the absence/presence of CM. \nWhereas both Non-dec and Dec-CM-cultures showed increased \nIL-10 secretion by monocyte-derived cells, only Dec was able to \ninduce a higher expression of the characteristic DC-10 tolerogen -\nic markers HLA-G and ILT2/CD85j (p<0.05, Friedman test). Then, \nDec and Non-dec-CM-treated cells were co-cultured with allogeneic \nlymphocytes for 5 days. On the last day, we observed an anti-in -\nflammatory microenvironment in Dec-CM-cultures, characterized by \na higher IL-10:IFN- g ratio production and a decreased CD4+CD25+ \nsubset (p<0.05, Friedman test). Interestingly, while both co-cultures \nshowed a higher frequency of CD4negHLA-G+ cells, only Dec-CM-\ntreated cells were able to induce CD4+HLA-G+ regulatory T cell sub -\nset (p<0.05, Friedman test). The present results suggest that decid -\nualization process promotes the differentiation of DC-10 subset able \nto induce HLA-G+ T cells that might play an immunoregulatory role \nin embryo implantation.  \n392.

The main strate -\ngy for the control is vaccination with FMD-Virus (FMDV) chemically \ninactivated with binary ethylenimide (FMDVi). In FMDV infection and \nin vaccination, the B cell response plays a major role by providing \nneutralizing/protective antibody in both animal models and natural \nhosts. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanovesicles involved in cell\u2013\ncell communication. EVs secreted by antigen-presenting cells (APC) \nparticipate in the activation of B and T cells through the presentation \nof native antigen membrane associated (to B cells) or by transfer -\nring MHC-peptide complexes (to T cells) and even complete antigen \nfrom DCs. In our previous work we demonstrated that murine APC \ncells can internalize FMDVi and release EVs expressing APC mark -\ners and high level of viral proteins during the first 24 h. In the present \nwork we aimed to evaluate the immune properties of these EVs in \nthe generation of B and T cell response against FMDV. We demon -\nstrated that EVs-FMDVi induced specific in vitro proliferation in vivo \nsensitized splenocytes  with FMDVi, EVs-FMDVi induced  specific \nB cell (16.05% \u00b1 0.61 p<0.001) and T cell proliferation (8.5% \u00b1 0.81 \np<0.01)  when compared to unstimulated sensitized splenocytes \n(9.66% \u00b1 0.17 and 5.70% \u00b1 0.15, respectively) detected by CFSE \ndilution.\nOur results revealed that EVs FMDVi could present part of FMDV \nproteins in native conformation or partially processed. These pep -\ntides can be recognized by the BCR and stimulate specific B cells \nresponse against viral infection. In addition, EVs FMDVi activate \ndirect or indirectly a T cell response that could collaborate in B cell \nactivation. \nThe knowledge derived from this work will serve to deepen the \nknowledge of the interrelation between the FMDV and the immune \nsystem that will serve for the rational design of vaccines.\n393.

Institut Curie, PSL Research University, INSERM, U932 \nParis, France\nClusterin is a multifunctional glycoprotein present in almost all tis -sues and body fluids. It is involved in a number of physiological and \npathological processes including apoptosis, protein homeostasis, \nAlzheimer\u00b4s disease and cancer. Although clusterin expression by \nmyeloid cells has been reported, its influences on dendritic cell (DC) \nfunction have not been analyzed. Here we show that clusterin ex -\npression by DCs plays a role in their ability to initiate the adaptive \nimmune response. \nAs we did before using monocyte derived DCs, we analyzed the \nexpression of clusterin by BDCA+ blood DCs. We found that clus -\nterin production was induced after LPS stimulation (mean  1,61 ng/\nml unstimulated vs 6,86 ng/ml stimulated, n=4, p<0,05 ).To look into \nthe role of clusterin on DC function we performed a knockdown (KD) \nstrategy using clusterin shRNA carrying lentiviruses and a scramble \n(SCR) construction as a control.  In a previous report we showed \nthat silencing of clusterin expression (CLU-KD) resulted in an in -\ncreased cell death of DCs upon LPS stimulation. We now analyzed \nthe function of CLU-KD-DCs in response to LPS stimulation. Control \nand CLU-KD DCs were stimulated with LPS for 24hs, cells were \ncollected and analyzed by FACS and supernatants were harvest -\ned and cytokine secretion was measured by ELISA. We found that \nphenotype maturation markers (DR, CD80, CD86, CD40 and PDL1) \nand cytokine secretion (IL-1, IL-6, TNF, IL-12 and IL-10) were not \nmodified after clusterin silencing (not shown). We next studied the \nrole of clusterin in antigen presentation culturing control and CLU-\nKD DCs with allogenic CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, CLU-KD dendrit -\nic cell ability to expand CD4 was found to be strongly diminished \n(mean 33,87 %CFSE- CLU-KD vs 19,15 CLU-KD LPS, n=6, Paired \nT test p<0.01). \nThese observations suggest that clusterin might play a role in the \ncontrol of the adaptive immune response.\n394.

However, CD4+ TFH cell \nsubset, which is critical for eliciting neutralizing antibodies, is poorly \nunderstood during pediatric COVID-19.\nAims: To characterize the circulating TFH (cTFH) cell subset and to \ndetermine SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody response in children \nhospitalized with acute mild and severe (pediatric multisystem in -\nflammatory syndrome, PIMS) COVID-19, compared to pre-pandem -\nic controls.\nMethods: Sera (n=337) and PBMCs (n=41) from hospitalized \nCOVID-19 children (age 1-14yr.) during different phases after dis -\nease onset and healthy donors (n=15, age 1-10 yr., HD) were col -\nlected to evaluate:\n1.Memory cTFH subset (CD3+CD4+CD45RA-CXCR5+) and cTFH \nprofiles (cTFH1 \u2013non-efficient helper associated with a suboptimal \nantibody production-, cTFH2, and cTFH17, \u2013efficient helpers) by \nflow cytometry during 1st week of COVID-19 diagnosis.\n2.Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD IgM and IgG serum levels during the \n1st week and/or 21 days after symptoms onset by ELISA.\nResults: Mild COVID (n=30) showed a cTFH profile similar to HD ABSTRACTS163\n(n=15). However, we detected a decrease of %cTFH1 (*) but an \nincrease of %cTFH17 (**) in peripheral blood of PIMS infants (n=11) \ncompared to both mild COVID-19 and HD. Indeed, the ratio (cTFH2 \nand cTFH17)/cTFH1 was increase in PIMS (**). Seropositivity rates \nwere 28% for IgM (n=109) and 25% for IgG (n=337) among children \nduring 1st week of diagnosis, and 63% for IgM (n=51) and 64% for \nIgG (n=55) after 21 days of symptoms onset. All children with PIMS \nreached the maximum detectable IgG OD. Interestingly, %cTFH17 \npositively correlated with \u03b1nti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG OD (*).\nConclusion: Our results showed that COVID-19 infected children \ndisplayed multiple hallmarks of effective humoral response, al -\nthough the neutralizing activity of antibodies remains to be elucidat -\ned. Moreover, the elevated levels of antibodies in PIMS infants point \ntowards their role in severity of disease.\n395.

Servicio de Nutrici\u00f3n, Hospital de Pediatr\u00eda Ricardo Gu -\nti\u00e9rrez\nAnti-proinsulin autoantibodies (PAA) are often the first markers that \nappear in patients with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and its prev -\nalence varies from 10-60% in child-adolescent patients. The gold \nstandard method for PAA detection is the Radioligand Binding Assay \n(RBA), a highly specific and sensitive technique, but expensive and \npolluting; thus, it is imperative to develop an alternative method. \nThe aim of this work was studying the prevalence of PAA in Argen -\ntine pediatric patients with T1DM using a novel flow cytometric mi -\ncrosphere-based immunoassay (FloCMIA). \nMaterials and methods : Human proinsulin (PI) was expressed \nas Thioredoxin fusion protein (TrxPI) in E. coli  and a fraction was \nbiotinylated. Sera from 100 normal human controls and 51 T1DM \npatients -all PAA positive by RBA- were used to optimize FloCMIA. \nA double paratope model was used in which samples were incu -\nbated with TrxPI-biotin and microspheres adsorbed with TrxPI. The \nimmune complexes were revealed using streptavidin-Phycoerythrin. \nThe geometric mean of the signals was analyzed, and the results \nwere expressed in Standard Deviation scores. With the optimized \nFloCMIA, the prevalence of PAA was evaluated in 60 samples of \npatients with T1DM (age range 0.1-18 years).\nResults : The study of ROC curves allowed choosing a cut-off value \nof 3.7 SDs and the AUC was 0.884, indicating that the method has \ngood ability to distinguish between samples from each group. The \nspecificity of FloCMIA was 97% and the analytical sensitivity 69%, \ncalculated as the percentage of patients RBA positive that were also \npositive by FloCMIA. There was a substantial agreement between \nmethods (kappa statistic=0.700). \nA prevalence of 30% for PAA was obtained in the population of \nT1DM patients studied.\nConclusions : An alternative method to RBA was developed with \ngood performance and less operational complexity and environmen -\ntal impact. The novel assay was implemented in Argentine patients \nwith T1DM to study the prevalence of PAA.\n396.

Proliferation assays were performed to evaluate the capa -\nbility of splenocytes to recognize rGAD65. Splenocytes from pre-di -\nabetic and diabetic NOD mice were cultured in triplicates in 96-well \nU-bottom plates with RPMI (basal proliferation) or with different con -\ncentration of the following diabetogenic antigens: 0.01ug/mL to 1 ug/\nmL of rGAD65, 0.1 ug/mL to 4 ug/mL of insulin and pancreatic islet \nlysate and 10 ug/mL of ovoalbumin as negative control. A positive \nunspecific control was carried out with ConA 10 ug/ml. The cells \nwere cultured for 5 days, [3H]TdR was added in the last 18h of the \nassay. Cells were harvested and the radioactivity incorporated was \ndetermined by liquid scintillation counter. Cell proliferation was ex -\npressed as Stimulation Index (SI = antigen-proliferation/basal prolif -\neration). SI obtained for the different doses of each treatment were \nnot significant. Besides, all antigen tested induced proliferation of \nNOD splenocytes compared to de basal condition (p\u02c20.01).  SI of \npre-diabetic NOD splenocytes ranged from 0.28\u00b10.06 to 2.45\u00b10.25 \nfor rGAD65 at 1 ug/mL to 0.01ug/mL, from 5.34\u00b11.38 to 4.06\u00b10.44 \nfor insulin at 4 ug/mL to 0.1ug/mL and from 5.15\u00b10.03 to 3.58\u00b10.48 \nfor islet lysates at 4 ug/mL to 0.1ug/mL. SI of overt-diabetic NOD \nsplenocytes ranged from 2.06\u00b10.32 to 2.35\u00b10.11, from 3.07\u00b10.19 to \n2.95\u00b10.42 and from 2.83\u00b10.28 to 2.01\u00b10.44, respectively. SI for OVA \nwas 0.44\u00b10.6 and 0.57\u00b10.02, and ConA 56.32\u00b15.84 and 15.16\u00b12.52 \nfor pre-diabetic and diabetic, respectively.\nIn sum, rGAD65 was successfully produced in S. frugiperda. More -\nover, rGAD65 stimulated diabetogenic splenocytes proliferation \nobtained from NOD mice, fortunately, similarly to insulin and islets \nlysate. The dose of 1\u00b5g/ml of rGAD65 seems to be toxic for cells. \nOur preliminary results suggested that rGAD65 can be a potential \ncandidate to generate immunotolerance to prevent experimental au -\ntoimmune diabetes.\n397.

Studies of these mechanisms have mainly fo -\ncused on the brain, yet we demonstrate here a significant influence \nof the peripheral immune system on this phenomenon. Lewis (LEW) MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020164\nand Fischer 344 (F344) rats have different immunological profiles \nand they display a distinct vulnerability to the reinforcing effects of \ncocaine, with F344 more resistant to reinstate cocaine-seeking be -\nhavior. Methods: Bone marrow from male LEW and F344 rats was \ntransferred to male F344 rats (F344/LEW-BM and F344/F344-BM), \nand these rats were trained to self-administer cocaine over 21 days. \nFollowing extinction, these animals received a sub-threshold primer \ndose of cocaine to evaluate reinstatement of drug-seeking behav -\nior. Results: F344/LEW-BM but not F344/F344-BM rats reinstated \ncocaine-seeking behavior, in conjunction with changes in their pe -\nripheral immune cell populations to a profile that corresponded to \nthat of the LEW donors. Cocaine treatment increased the CD4+ \nT-cells in F344/LEW-BM rats, and the splenic expression of Il-17A, \nTgf-b, Tlr-2, Tlr-4 and Il-1b was altered in both groups. Discussion: \nWe propose that peripheral T-cells respond to cocaine, with CD4+ \nT-cells in particular undergoing Th17 polarization and generating \nlong-term memory, these cells releasing mediators that trigger cen -\ntral mechanisms to induce reinstatement after a second encounter. \nConclusion: This immune response may explain the high rates of \nrecidivism observed despite long periods of detoxification, shedding \nlight on the mechanisms underlying the vulnerability and resilience \nof specific individuals, and opening new perspectives for personal -\nized medicine in the treatment of relapse.\n398.

Paz.\nEHEC is responsible for developing typical Hemolytic Uremic Syn -\ndrome (HUS) and Argentina has the highest incidence in the world. \nThe endemo-epidemic behavior that HUS presents in our country \nwas associated with person-to-person transmission. Since children \nbelow 5 years old are the most affected, our objective was to deter -\nmine the frequency of kindergarten teachers with anti-LPS-EHEC \nantibodies in serum.\nOne hundred and fifty teachers from J.C. Paz district from Buenos \nAires Province participated in an informative talk given by LuSUH, a \nnon-governmental association, about good practices to reduce HUS \ntransmission. Then, 63 of them voluntarily gave, under a signed \nwritten informed consent, a sample of blood obtained by finger \npuncture. A commercial ELISA (Chemtest, Arg) was used to detect \nspecific IgM and IgG isotypes against 4 types of LPS-EHEC: O157, \nO145, O121 and O103. These variants represent approximately \n87% of the EHEC serotypes associated with HUS in Argentina. The \nIgM finding was considered as indirect evidence of current infection \nwith the EHEC specific serotype.\nForty-two samples were evaluated, 60% (25/42) of them were pos -\nitive for at least one type of LPS. Fifty-six percent of them (14/25) \nwere IgM positive. Fifty percent of the positive samples were re -\nactive for LPS O157, 26% for LPS O121, 12% for LPS O145 and \n2% for LPS O103. Among the samples positive for LPS O157, 5% \nbelonged to IgM isotype, 31% to IgG and 14% had both. The IgG \nisotype was the unique detected for LPS O145 and O103 (12 and \n2%, respectively). For LPS O121, the IgM isotype was detected in \n2%, IgG in 12% and both isotypes in 12% of the samples.\nThe elevated frequency of LPS-EHEC reactive samples (60%) re -\nflects the high circulation of EHEC strains in our country. This agrees \nwith the prevalence of anti-Stx2 antibodies reported in our popula -\ntion previously. Very strikingly, nearly half of these individuals carry \nIgM, suggesting that they would be in the active phase of infection.399.

The aim of this work is to investigate how \nintestinal environment affects pathogen virulence and horizontal \ntransmission in both strains. \n3 days post infection (pi), we analyzed the Stx production of recov -\nered O157 from C57BL and BALB feces. Results showed similar Stx \nproduction by VERO and ELISA assays. Besides, we determined \nthe inflammatory activity of feces through a LPS-dependent Hek -\nBlue-hTLR4 reporter line assay. Feces from C57BL showed inflam -\nmatory activity at day 1, 2 and 3 pi (p<0.0001, p<0.001 and p<0.01 \nrespectively vs control). The maximal activity was statistically dif -\nferent from BALB at day 1 (p<0.0001). Feces from BALB showed \ninflammatory activity only at day 2 pi (p<0.01) [2way-ANOVA].  \nWe tested infectivity of O157 in C57BL and BALB through co-hous -\ning experiments (2 infected + 5 non infected mice of the same strain \nwere co-housed). The number of infected naive mice was recorded \nby O157 shedding. Despite all O157 inoculated C57BL died, 60% \nand 100% of naive mates were infected at day 3 and 7 pi respective -\nly (one of them died). All inoculated BALB survived and only 1 out of \n5 naive mates was infected at day 3 pi; this mouse recovered and \nnegativized. At day 5 pi, a second mouse resulted infected (none of \nthem died).\nThe local anti-O157 IgA response was assessed in feces from both \nstrains. A significant population of IgA-coated bacteria was detected \nin pellets from infected BALB at day 3 pi by cytometry (infected vs \ncontrol p<0.05; 2way-ANOVA). Besides, anti-O157 IgA was detect -\ned in all surviving BALB at day 7 pi by ELISA (infected vs control \np<0.05; Student\u2019s t test). \nBALB mice showed reduced horizontal transmission, lower and de -\nlayed inflammatory response and a specific and early local humoral \nresponse in feces compared to C57BL.\n400.

Efficient priming of CD8+ T cell responses requires not only \nthe processing and presentation of antigens, but the expression of \ncostimulatory molecules by activated dendritic cells (DCs). \nTo analyze whether the interaction of T. cruzi with DCs promotes cell \nmaturation, primary cultures of DCs were generated from mouse \nbone marrow (BMDCs) and incubated with trypomastigotes (Tp) \nof the Tulahu\u00e9n strain of T. cruzi . DCs activation was analyzed at \ndifferent time points by measuring the expression of the costimu -\nlatory molecule CD86 by flow cytometry. The activation of BMDCs ABSTRACTS165\nwas only evident after 18 hours of co-culture (CD86 expression \nincreased by 40%; statistical significance analyzed by Bonferroni \nTwo-way ANOVA). \nThen, we analyzed whether DC activation upon interaction with T. \ncruzi  increased the cell capacity to cross-present exogenous anti -\ngens. To do so, matured BMDCs (previously stimulated with Tp from \nT. cruzi  for 18 hours) were incubated with soluble ovalbumin (OVA) \nand co-cultured with the B3Z hybridoma cell line. OVA cross-presen -\ntation promote B3Z activation and the generation of a colorimetric \nreaction measured by OD. Our preliminary results show that BMDCs \nincubated with Tp increases OVA cross-presentation. \nWe are also interested to understand whether the parasitophorous \nvacuole (PV) formed upon T. cruzi  infection of DCs can serve as an \norganelle involved in the presentation of parasitic antigens. Hence, \nby using confocal microscopy, we evidenced the recruitment of \nTapasin and Calreticulin (components of the cross-presentation ma -\nchinery) to the PV after 2 hours of infection of BMDCs suggesting \nthat this organelle can act as a cross-presenting organelle. \nSummarizing, we consider that antigen cross-presentation after T. \ncruzi  internalization by DCs is a likely efficient mechanism that could \nactively participates in the orchestration of CD8+ T cell responses \nagainst the infection.\n401.

Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas. Univer -\nsidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba\nTissue repair CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (tisTregs) are a spe -\ncialized Treg subset that exhibit tissue-specific phenotypic, function -\nal and transcriptional profiles. tisTregs maintain tissue homeosta -\nsis and also display conventional immunoregulatory properties. T. \ncruzi  (Tc) triggers a strong effector response that controls parasite \nspreading but promotes pathological tissue damage. We previously \ndetermined that during the acute phase of Tc infection, there is a \nreduction in tisTregs frequency and numbers in Spleen, Liver and \nSkeletal Muscle (SM) that correlates with decreased systemic levels \nof their growth factor IL-33. We also found altered values of bio -\nchemical markers of tissue damage (LDH, AST, ALT, CK-MB, glu -\ncose) in plasma.\nIn the current work we aimed to evaluate the behavior of this cell \npopulation and its correlation with biomarkers of damage as well as \nsystemic IL-33 levels during the chronic phase of this infection. To \nthis end, Foxp3-GFP C57BL/6 mice were infected (INF) with 5000 \nTc parasites (Tulahuen). At 170 days post infection, (ST2+KLRG-1+) \ntisTreg cell numbers were quantified at different tissues by flow cy -\ntometry. The frequency and numbers of tisTregs were increased in \ntarget tissues like skeletal muscle and visceral adipose tissue but \nnot in spleen and liver from INF mice in comparison to non-infected \ncontrols. INF mice also showed higher plasma levels of IL-33, as \ndetermined by ELISA. Lastly, only an elevated level of LDH among \nother biochemical markers remained in INF versus NI mice as evi -\ndence of damage. \nThis results together with our reported data support the speculation \nthat during the acute phase of Tc infection, the decrease of tisTregs \nmay be necessary to allow the immune control of parasite replica -\ntion; while their expansion in target tissues during the chronic phase \nmight be necessary to avoid excessive damage over time. Modu -\nlation of this cell population would allow us to better understand its \nrole in this disease.   \n402. (168)  EARLY TREG CELL DEPLETION DURING TRY-\nPANOSOMA CRUZI  INFECTION PROMOTES CD8+ T \nCELL IMMUNITY AND PARASITE CONTROL IN THE \nACUTE AND CHRONIC PHASES\nAraujo Furlan CL1, Boccardo S1, Rodriguez C1, Montes CL1, \nGruppi A1, Acosta Rodr\u00edguez EV1\n1. CIBICI-CONICET, Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica Cl\u00ednica, \nFacultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba\nWe reported that after Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc) infection, Tregs un -\ndergo a marked and sustained reduction in frequency. This natural \ncontraction of the Treg response was critical to allow the emergence \nof protective anti-parasite CD8+ T cell immunity in the acute phase. \nAccordingly, we previously demonstrated that Treg depletion at day \n(d) 5 post-infection (pi) but not at d11pi impacted on the magnitude \nof anti-parasite CD8+ T cell response and the ability to control par -\nasite replication in the acute phase. Considering this, we hypothe -\nsized that Tregs may exert a role during early events of T cell prim -\ning. To test this, DEREG mice were infected with Tc and injected with \ndiphtheria toxin (DT) or PBS at d5 and 6pi. The next day, DT-treated \nanimals showed increased numbers of B cells, monocytes and neu -\ntrophils in the spleen compared to controls (p<0.05). Furthermore, \nCD86 expression was upregulated on splenic dendritic cells and \nmacrophages of DT-injected mice in contrast to controls (p<0.05). \nEvaluation of the expression of different suppression markers on \nTregs from infected mice did not evidence significant phenotypic \nactivation of splenic Tregs at 5 dpi. This suggests that an undeter -\nmined mediator and/or the basal expression of multiple regulatory \nmarkers might be involved in the suppression. Finally, we looked \nif Treg depletion at early time points had an effect over the effector \nresponse and parasite control at the chronic phase. We found that \nmice treated with DT as above showed higher frequency of total and \nactivated CD8+ T cells infiltrating liver, skeletal muscle and heart \nat d97pi than control mice, which coincided with reduced parasite \nburden in spleen and liver (p<0.05). Altogether, our results suggest \nthat during Tc infection Tregs suppress the CD8+ T cell response at \nthe priming stage through indirect mechanisms. These events at the \nacute phase would have late effects over the effector, likely patho -\ngenic, response and parasite control at the chronic phase.\n403.

The present study describes the diagnosis of 27 HUS pa -\ntients attended at Hospital Municipal del Ni\u00f1o of San Justo, Province \nof Buenos Aires, during 2017-2020 period. The aim was to perform \nthe etiological diagnosis of HUS cases based on the identification of \nShiga toxin-producing E. coli  (STEC) strains and to determine the \ncontribution of anti-Lipopolysaccharide (a-LPS) antibodies in serum \nto confirm the cases as typical HUS. \nScreening of stx1, stx2 and rfbO157 genes by a validated multiplex \nPCR was performed in fecal cultures and in isolated colonies us -\ning sorbitol agar culture (SMAC). Serological tests to detect a-LPS \nO157, O121, O145 IgM/IgG antibodies were carried out using Glyco \niELISA (CHEMLIS\u00ae).\nSTEC infections were diagnosed in 10 out of the 27 HUS patients \nstudied: stx2/rfbO157/a-O157LPS+ (n=5); stx2/a-O145LPS+ (n=2); stx2 \n(n=2); stx2/a-O157LPS+ (n=1). In 17 HUS PCR negatives (PCR-), \n12 a-O157LPS+, 4 a-O145LPS+ and 1 a-LPS negative were iden -\ntified. A significant association was found between PCR and a-LPS \nresults, Chi-square P = 0.0460. In brief, 40.7% of the patients were \nPCR+ and 88.9% were a-LPS+; 94.1% of the HUS PCR- were \na-LPS+; 66.7% of the patients resulted a-O157LPS+. \nAdditionally, the excretion time was evaluated in 10 cases of HUS \nPCR+: 6 HUS stx2 (range: 7-17 days, median: 8.5 days) and 4 HUS \nstx2/rfbO157 (range: 2-8 days, median: 6 days). The excretion time MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

We aimed to identify immuno-endocrine responses \nover a six-month follow-up of anti-tuberculous (anti-TB) treatment in \nHIV+ individuals that were associated with control of TB. \nMethods: Plasma levels of cortisol, DHEA and DHEA-S, percent -\nages of CD4+ regulatory T cell subsets and number of IFN-\u03b3-se -\ncreting cells were determined. Several cytokines, chemokines and \nC-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured. Results were ana -\nlyzed, correlated with clinical data and compared to similar data from \nHIV-1-monoinfected individuals, HIV infected individuals with latent \nTB infection and healthy donors. \nResults: Throughout the course of anti-TB/HIV treatment, reduction \nof viral load (p<0.001) and increase of absolute CD4+ count (p<0.05) \nand CD4/CD8 ratio (p<0.05) were observed. DHEA (p<0.05) and \nDHEA-S (p<0.01) plasma levels raised while cortisol (p<0.05) di -\nminished, which correlated to parameters underlying control of in -\nfections (CD4+ counts, CD4/CD8 ratio and lung-restricted TB infec -\ntion). Furthermore, the balance between cortisol and DHEA may be \nused as predictor of anti-TB treatment efficacy in HIV+ individuals \n(p<0.005). Clinical improvement was associated with reduced fre -\nquency of unconventional Tregs (p<0.05), increment in Mycobacte -\nrium tuberculosis -specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells (p<0.05) and dimi -\nnution of systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6, p<0.05). Finally, we \nfound significant changes of circulating cytokines and chemokines. \nConclusion: This study suggests that the combined anti-HIV/TB \ntherapies results in a recovery of the adrenal axis and immune re -\nsponses toward similar values to HIV-chronically infected individuals \nand may expand the knowledge about specific treatment response \nin HIV-TB patients.\n405.

Previously, our group showed \nthat CT is the main responsible of thymus atrophy, characterized by a decrease in the number of immature double positive (DP) thy -\nmocytes and the accumulation of regulatory T cells within the CD4 \nsimple positive compartment. Here, we evaluated if the deleterious \nimmune-endocrine response caused by T. cruzi  infection upon the \nthymus is modified by the administration of our promissory exper -\nimental vaccine candidate. Therefore, BALB/c female (5-6/group) \nwere immunized intranasally (three doses, one every two weeks) \nwith vaccine formulations based in trans-sialidase (TS) antigen plus \nc-di-AMP as adjuvant. As controls, mice were treated with saline \nsolution (SS) or with TS or c-di-AMP alone. Fifteen days after the \nlast immunization mice were orally challenged with 3000 parasites \nof Tulahuen strain. Parasitemia and clinical score were evaluated \nseveral times after infection. To assess the impact of immunization \nover the immune-endocrine response mice were sacrificed after 100 \ndays of infection. The thymus was weighted and thymocyte subpop -\nulations were evaluated by flow cytometry. Also, adrenal response \nwas evaluated indirectly by determination of gland weight and StAR \ngene expression by qPCR (enzyme involved in CT synthesis). \nThe vaccinated group (TS+c-di-AMP) showed a diminished par -\nasitaemia (p<0,05 vs infected SS). Thymic atrophy (weight and \ncellularity) was very prominent in infected SS mice compared to \nTS+c-di-AMP. Despite protective effects TS+c-di-AMP, only tended \nto prevent DP and Tregs loss, while at adrenal level, induce a minor \nlevel of StAR expression and a tendency to develop a minor ad -\nrenal hyperplasia. In conclusion, TS+c-di-AMP vaccination protects \nagainst oral challenge with T. cruzi but provokes minor effects upon \nchronic thymic atrophy and adrenal response. \n406.

Ciudad de \nBuenos Aires, Argentina.\n3 IMPaM, CONICET, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de \nBuenos Aires, Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, Argentina\nBackground\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the commonest cause \nfor hospitalization in infants and it is not clear yet why some children \nwith no apparent risk factors develop severe bronchiolitis. Genetic \nvariation in the receptor for the Fc portion of IgG (Fc\u03b3R) determines \ntheir affinity for IgG subclasses and has been linked to susceptibility \nand/or progression of several infectious diseases. Here we study \nthe association between a polymorphism for Fc\u03b3RIIa (H131R) and \nRSV disease.  \nMethods  \nBlood samples were collected from 182 infants \u226424-month-old (50 \nuninfected, 114 moderate RSV-infected with moderate progression \nand 18 with severe disease). Fc\u03b3RIIa-H131R SNP genotypic fre -\nquencies (HH, HR, RR) and anti-RSV IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 levels \nwere studied. \nResults\nWe found no differences among genotypic frequencies for Fc\u03b3 -\nRIIa-131H/R SNP between uninfected and RSV-infected infants. \nHowever, we observed a significant higher frequency of HH geno -\ntype in severe RSV-infected children versus moderate patients. HH \nRSV-infants from severe group presented more factors associated \nto severity than HR or RR patients. Furthermore, compared to mod -\nerate RSV-infected infants, severe patients showed higher levels of \nanti-RSV IgG1 and IgG3. \nConclusions \nWe found that Fc\u03b3RIIa SNP is not related with a higher susceptibility \nfor RSV infection. However, we did find an association between an \nFc\u03b3RIIa-H131 variant and progression to severe RSV disease once \ninfected, which might support the involvement of IgG immune com -\nplexes in RSV pathogenesis. This genetic factor could also help to \npredict the worse outcome and identify healthy infants at risk at time \nof hospitalization.  ABSTRACTS167\n407.

Although \nthere are drugs for its treatment, currently there are no prophylac -\ntic vaccines to combat the disease. Here, we evaluated the immu -\nnogenicity and prophylactic efficacy generated by a recombinant \nTrans-sialidase (TSr) expressed in E. coli.  This fragment was se -\nlected by bioinformatics and contains different B and T epitopes. \nThus, female BALB/c mice (n=5/6/group) were immunized intrana -\nsally (three doses, one every two weeks) with different formulations \nthat combine the TSr with different adjuvants (c-di-AMP or ISPA). As \ncontrol groups we used mice not immunized (NI) or only treated with \nTSr. Fifteen days after the last immunization, in vivo  cell-mediated \n(delayed hypersensitivity test -DHT-), in vitro  specific splenocyte \nproliferation (Ki67 by flow cytometry) and specific humoral (ELISA) \nresponse were assayed. Then, animals were orally challenged with \n2500 Tc/mice (Tulahuen strain). During acute phase, parasitemia, \nclinical affectation (score), muscle damage (plasma CK) was eval -\nuated. In terms of immunogenicity,TSr+c-di-AMP and TSr+ISPA \ngroups developed an enhanced  DHT after 24-48 h, compared to \ncontrol groups (in all cases, p<0.05). Specific proliferation of CD4 \nlymphocytes was also enhanced in splenocytes from TSr+c-di-AMP \nand TSr+ISPA groups (p<0.5 vs. NI and TSr). Moreover, the same \nanimals showed enhanced levels of IgG2a and IgG1 (in all cases, \np<0,5). Early parasitemia are less notorious in TSr+c-di-AMP and \nTSr+ISPA, but only TSr+c-di-AMP animals control more effectively \nthe infection along the acute phase, being their clinical affectation \nless evident. Coincidentally, CK levels were 9-times lower in this \ngroup than NI (p<0.05). Taken together, these results suggest that \nTSr+c-di-AMP formulation may be a good vaccine candidate for the \ndevelopment of a prophylactic mucosal vaccine against T. cruzi  in-\nfection. \n408.

Dendritic cells \n(DCs) can cross-present exogenous antigens to T CD8+ lympho -\ncytes, a process that requires several intracellular transport path -\nways. Knowing that CT perturbs the intracellular transport, we hy -\npothesized that chlamydia may alter antigen cross-presentation by \ndisturbing key intracellular transport events.  By using the DC line \nJAWS-II and the CT serovar L2, we observed that CT evades most \nof the interaction with the endocytic pathway since CT does not lo -\ncalize to specific markers of early endosomes, lysosomes or mul -\ntivesicular bodies. However, CT did showed a strong interaction with \nthe recycling pathway marker TfR and with Rab proteins that control \nendocytic recycling.  Also by confocal microscopy we evidenced a \nstriking redistribution of MHC-I molecules in CT infected DCs. These \ncells lost their typical MHC-I location in both, the perinuclear recy -cling center and the plasma membrane. By flow cytometry and WB \nanalysis, we confirmed that MHC-I molecules do not transport prop -\nerly to the cell surface in infected DCs, as compared to uninfected \ncells. Although the total amounts of MHC-I molecules are similar in \nboth conditions.  By using  the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) and \nthe specific CD8+ T lymphocytes (B3Z) to measure cross-presenta -\ntion, we found a significant decrease in the cross-presentation ability \nof infected DCs with both, soluble and latex beads-associated OVA.  \nFinally, we discarded that this effect is caused by loss of endocytic \ncapacity in the infected DC. Altogether these results indicate that \nCT infection alters the normal MHC-I intracellular distribution and \nimpairs antigen cross-presentation by DCs.\n409.

We have previously described higher  expression of Galec -\ntin-1( Gal1) in the spleen and Peyers patches (PPs) of mice infected \nwith Ye. Notably, this effect was prevented when mice were infected \nwith a YopP-deficient mutant strain (Ye DyopP ). Considering that \nGal1 has an important immunoregulatory role, and has been shown \nto interact with certain bacterial glycoproteins, we decided to evalu -\nate the role of Gal1 in Ye infection and its potential interaction with \nYopP. We observed that Gal1 is able to bind Ye and moreover, one \nof Gal1 ligands in these cells is YopP, as a Ye DyopP  mutant showed \ndecreased Gal1 binding (p< 0.05) by flow cytometry when compared \nto Ye wt. As early control of Ye infection involves activated macro -\nphages (M\u03a6), we also evaluated Gal1-YopP interactions and their \nrole in the modulation of macrophage function. Quantification of ni-\ntrites and TNF production in supernatants of Lgals1-/-and WT  M\u03a6 in-\nfected either with Ye wt or Ye \u2206yopP  showed that even though Gal1 \nand YopP did not influence TNF levels, coordinately inhibited nitric \noxide (NO) production (p< 0.05). Administration of exogenous re -\ncombinant Gal1 (rGal1) was not able to counterbalance the increase \nin NO levels observed in Lgals1-/- M\u03a6 infected with Ye DyopP . More -\nover,  in vivo  experiments showed that Lgals1-/- mice orally infected \nwith the Ye DyopP  presented lower bacterial load in PPs when com -\npared to Lgals1-/- mice infected with the Ye wt (p< 0.01).  Exogenous \nadministration  of rGal1  was not able to restrain the improved anti-Ye \nresponses generated in absence of Gal1 and YopP.

We aimed to compare the hepatic immune \nresponse in Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) and C (CHC) infections and \nassess their role in liver damage. \nImmunostaining was done in 68 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embed -\nded liver biopsies from 26 CHB and 42 CHC treatment-naive pa -\ntients to characterize liver infiltrate: [Th (CD4+), Th1 (Tbet+), Th17 \n(IL-17A+), Treg (Foxp3+), and CTL (CD8+)].  Quantification: por -\ntal (P)= +/total lymphocytes or lobular= + lymphocytes in 10 fields; \n(400x). Hepatitis severity and fibrosis were assessed by the modi -\nfied Knodell (HAI) and METAVIR. \nComparing CHB and CHC lymphocyte prevalence was alike in P \nareas (Th>CTL>Treg>Th17>Th1). However, CHC patients showed \nhigher frequencies of Treg, Th17 and Th1 cells (p=0.001, p=0.005 \nand p=0.003, respectively, U-test). In contrast, cell distribution \nwas different in the lobular area ( CHB : CTL> Treg>Th17=Th1>Th \nvs CHC : CTL>Th1>Treg>Th=Th17) with higher frequencies of \nTh, Th17 and Th1 cells in CHC (p=0.04, p=0.001 and p=0.001, \nrespectively, U-test) compared with CHB. Regarding liver dam -\nage, patients with analogous disease stage showed similar cell \nfrequencies but only in CHC P Th17 were associated with ad -\nvanced fibrosis (p=0.03, U-test) and just in CHB P Th (p=0.04, \nU-test) and lobular CTLs and Th17 cells (p=0.02 and p=0.01, respectively; U-test) were increased in severe hepatitis cases.\nEven when all studied populations were identified in CHB and CHC, \ncommon and particular features related to liver damage were detect -\ned. Lobular CTLs prevalence in both infections implies their contri -\nbution in hepatitis pathogenesis. As for CHB, despite the presence \nof a regulatory microenvironment, CTLs and Th17 cells promote \nhepatitis severity, suggesting a Treg failure in limiting liver damage \nbut favouring viral persistence. By contrast, CHC showed a highly \ninflammatory context with CTL and Th1 majority and Th17 cells en -\nhancing liver fibrosis.\n \n412.

Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) are crucial for GCs formation \nand antibody-affinity maturation. Other GCs-protagonists are follicu -\nlar cytotoxic CD8+T cells (Tfc), who share gene signatures with Tfh \ncells but their function is not well established. In some models, Tfc \ncontribute to eliminate infected cells inside the follicle.\nOur aim was to study different protagonists of GC reaction and \nplasmablasts(PB) response along T. cruzi infection. For that, \nC57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally infected with 5.000 trypomasti -\ngotes of T. cruzi (Tulahu\u00e9n strain) and the frequency and number of \nTfh, Tfc and PB were evaluated by flow cytometry at different days \npost infection(dpi) in the spleen. Mice injected with PBS were used \nas controls.\nWe observed that the peak of the Tfh(CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+ICOS+), \nTfc(CD8+CXCR5+PD-1+ICOS+) and PB(B220loCD138+) response \nwas at 18dpi.These responses preceded GC-B cell response \n(B220+FAS+GL-7+Bcl-6+)which peaked at 28 dpi. Tfc had a higher \nexpression of Bcl-6 and Tcf-1 than non-Tfc CD8+ T cells(p<0,05). \nNear 25% of Tfc, but only 3% of non-Tfc, were specific for the immu -\nnodominant T. cruzi TSKB20 peptide. Tfc were CD107a+ and IFN-y, \nTNF-a, Granzyme B and Perforin-producing cells. By immunofluo -\nrescence of spleen sections, at 15 dpi, we detected CD8+T cells \ninside and around B cells follicles and spatially opposed to follicular \ndendritic cells; at 23dpi and 28dpi, all CD8+T cells were outside the \nfollicles and some of them in close contact with PB.\nTo sum up, we observed an activated CD8+T cells subset whose \npeak of the response was prior to CG, expressed Tfh-related mole -\ncules and were observed in close contact with B cells subsets. Tfc \ncould be influencing humoral response, controlling infection more \nefficiently, or regulating some population of CG.\n413.

In particular, thrombotic complica -\ntions in patients with COVID19 are common and contribute to organ \nfailure and mortality. It has been reported that COVID19 patients \npresent increased platelet activation. Our aim was to evaluate if acti -\nvated platelets from COVID19 patients form aggregates with mono -\ncytes and modulate their activation and functionality. \nSamples from whole blood and PBMCs were obtained from healthy \ndonors or COViD19 patients. PBMCs were purified by ficoll-paque \nand washed platelets were obtained from plasma by centrifugation \nwith 200 nM of prostaglandin I2 . Phenotype and cytokine production \nwas evaluated by flow cytometry and ELISA. The viral production \nwas measured by cytopathic effect in Vero cells. \nWe observed that COVID19 patients presented an increased per -\ncentage of platelet-monocyte aggregates  compared to control \nsamples (7,1 \u00b1 1,9, n=10; 44,3 \u00b1 3,9, n=30, p<0,0001).  We did \nnot observe a correlation between platelet-monocyte aggregates \nand severity of the disease.  When we analyzed the functionality of \nmonocytes we found that COVID19 patients presented an increased \nproduction of IL8 (n=4, p<0,05) in monocytes aggregated with plate -\nlets  but not  of TNF\u03b1 and IL6 (n=6). \nWe also evaluated the role of platelets in the dissemination of the \nvirus. Interestingly, we observed that COVID19 platelets but not \ncontrol platelets, inhibited the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells \n(n=2, p<0,05). \nThese results show that patients COVID19 present increased plate -\nlet-monocyte aggregates. Further studies are required to evaluate \nthe role of these aggregates and platelets in SARS-CoV-2 patho -\ngenesis. \n416.

Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD) comprise a group of me -\ntabolopathies sharing similar clinical phenotypes, in which acute hy -\nperammonemia (HA) crises often occur. Among others, intercurrent \ninfections have been empirically proposed as the main precipitants. \nMoreover, acute HA events following infections are clinically differ -\nent from those triggered by other precipitants, representing a distinct \nclinical entity with increased morbidity. As infections are concurrent \nwith HA events, we hypothesized that HA may per se induce an \nimmunocompromised state that would be causal of the observed \nrecurrent infections. \nMethods.  Different phenotypic and functional immune function pa -\nrameters were assessed in UCD patients and healthy control vol -\nunteers. In vitro  lymphoproliferation against different polyclonal and \nmemory recall cell antigens, T helper cell subset frequencies, cyto -\nkine secretion in culture supernatants, total immunoglobulin serum \nlevels, and the glycosylation status of leukocyte cell surface proteins \nwere assessed. MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020170\nResults. A state of marked hypogammaglobulinemia was detected \nin UCD patients. Conversely, similar lymphoproliferative responses \nto either polyclonal or memory recall cell antigens were observed in \npatients with respect to controls. However, patients undergoing HA \ncrises   presented significantly reduced lymphoproliferation to differ -\nent stimuli. Remarkably, significantly reduced counts of Th17 and \nTh1 cells, together with decreased IL17 and IFN \u0263 secretion levels, \nwere observed in UCD patients. Moreover, monocytes and lympho -\ncytes seem to display an altered glycosylation pattern in conditions \nof HA.    \nDiscussion.  These preliminary data indicate that UCD patients \npresent alterations in different biomarkers of immune function, es -\npecially during HA crises, suggesting a state of immunocompromise \nthat would render patients susceptible to infections. The latter would \nfurther aggravate the HA status increasing the morbidity/mortality \nrisk. \n417. (453)  METFORMIN REGULATES INFLAMMATORY RE -\nSPONSE OF T.

Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba\nDuring the acute phase of  T. cruzi  infection, high replication of the \nparasite is controlled by a strong inflammatory response with activa -\ntion of the innate immune cells due to increase of Th1 proinflamma -\ntory cytokines. Macrophages (M\u00f8) have been described to control \nintracellular parasite replication when iNOS expression and ON pro -\nduction are induced in vitro . We previously reported that pretreat -\nment of bone marrow derived M\u00f8 with Metformin (Metf) leads these \ncells to control parasite replication presumably by modulating inflam -\nmasome activation without increase of iNOS expression. However, \nit has been demonstrated that high and continuous ON release by \nM\u00f8 and other cells, is involved in Th1 T cell suppression. In this con -\ntext, Metf was associated to reduce inflammatory-related ischemic \ncardiovascular events, prolong lifespan and decrease aged-related \ninflammation. To determine the M\u00f8 activation profile during in vivo  T. \ncruzi  infection and the possibles effects of Metf treatment, we tested \niNOS expression by FACS in Peritoneal M\u00f8 (Pe-M\u00f8) subsets, LPM \n(Large Pe-M\u00f8) and SPM (Small Pe-M\u00f8). We observed increased \niNOS expression (p<0.001) in LPM and SPM during the acute phase \n(day 20 post infection) that declines around day 40, despite the high \nON levels in plasma at this point. To determine other sources of ON \nproduction we assessed iNOS expression in spleen cells by FACS \nand we found small but consistent F4/80+CD11b+iNOS+ cells. After \nthat, we performed an ex vivo  treatment of total Pe-M\u00f8 from infected \nmice in acute phase and we observed a decrease in supernatants \nlevels of ON and TNF-a levels by ELISA (p<0,05) when cells are \nexposed to Metf. To test if Metf polarize M\u00f8 to an antiinflammatory \nprofile, we tested arginase expression by WB and IL-10 production \nby ELISA but we observe no changes in these parameters. Taken \ntogether, these results suggest that Metf could modulate exacerbat -\ned M\u00f8 activation during high parasitaemia acute phase that could \nlead to organ damage.\n418.

CONICET\nPertussis is a vaccine preventable respiratory disease which is cur -\nrently considered a serious health problem.  We have designed a \nnovel pertussis vaccine candidate based on outer membrane ves -\nicles derived from B. pertussis (OMVs Bp) that is safe, highly im -\nmunogenic, and protective in mouse model. OMVs Bp includes a wide range of immunogens and PAMPs. Since these PAMPs could \nhave adjuvant properties by themselves we wonder which is the \ncontribution of the OMVs\u2019 integrity on their adjuvant properties. To \naddresses this aspect, we perform comparative studies between in -\ntact OMVs (OMVi) and mechanically disrupted OMVs (OMVD).  Both \nOMVs were isolated and treated with standardized protocols and \nformulated with Fim3, a poorly immunogenic protein that is not pres -\nent in OMVs. Fim3 was expressed and purified from a recombinant \nEscherichia coli  strain.  An immunization scheme was performed in \nBalb/C mice consisting of two immunizations with 0,75 \u00b5g of OMVi or \nOMVD combined with Fim3 (10 \u00b5g). Non immunized mice and OMVi, \nOMVD, or Fim3 immunized mice were used as control. Postvaccina -\ntion serum samples were obtained, and a-Fim3 antibody levels were \nevaluated by Immunoblot and ELISA. By performing these exper -\niments, we detected that OMVi+Fim3 induces higher antibody re -\nsponse a-Fim3 than OMVD+Fim3 (OMVi+Fim3: 3257 \u00b1 264,5 vs OM-\nVD+Fim3: 236,05 \u00b1 56,63).   Moreover, OMVi+Fim3 induced higher \nlevels of a-Fim3 antibodies in comparison with that detected in Fim3 \nimmunized mice (Fim3: 53,43 \u00b1 11,97). Consistent with the ELISA \nresults, serum samples obtained from OMVi+Fim3 immunized mice \nshown the highest reactivity against Fim3 in Immunoblot. The re -\nsults presented here point out the relevance of OMVs Bp integrity for \nits adjuvant properties. \n419.

Argentina.\nThe recent increase in pertussis cases demands more effective ap -\nproaches to overcome this health problem. In parallel with maternal \nimmunization, neonatal immunization (NI) is a strategy needing re -\nvision. Using the intranasal challenge mouse model (Balb/C), we \nobserved that NI may improve current pertussis epidemiology. For \nneonates without maternal immunity, mixed vaccination schedules \nwith commercial pertussis acellular vaccine (BoostrixTM, GSK) and \nour novel outer membrane vesicle (OMV)-based vaccine candidate \nappear to be the most appropriate schedule to induce protection in \nthe pups. For offspring from immune mothers, to avoid blunting ef -\nfect, NI should be carried out with vaccines other than those applied \nduring pregnancy. Here we detected that after 2-dose vaccination \nschedules administered subcutaneously at the age of 1 week and 3 \nweeks, the blunting effect of maternal immunity was lost, regardless \nof the type of vaccine used. At 7 days after the challenge (at 14 days \nafter the last vaccine dose), any of the 2-dose schedule tested re -\nduced at least 4 logs the B. pertussis  CFU recovered from the lungs \nin comparison to non-immunized mice (n=6 per group, p <0.05). We \nalso analyzed whether NI is effective in protecting against clinical \nisolates currently circulating in different countries. Despite NI is ef -\nfective against several B. pertussis  strains, it did not reverse the low \nlevels of protection induced by acellular vaccine against circulating \nstrains that do not express pertactin. This result was observed even \nin neonates with maternal immunity (only a reduction of 2-logs was \ndetected in comparison with non-immunized mice, n=6 per group, \np<0.05). All the assays were repeated at least 3 times. These re -\nsults, which complement the previous ones, indicate that although \nneonatal immunization would contribute to improving the control of \nthe disease, it is inefficient against clinical isolates with increased \nprevalence in countries that only use acellular vaccines.\n420.

We have reported that CD73 activity has a tis -\nsue-dependent impact on the host immune response against acute \nTrypanosoma cruzi infection. Here, we explored the effect of CD73 \ndeficiency (CD73KO) on immune cells infiltrating target tissues \nduring chronic T. cruzi  murine infection. Through flow cytometry, we \nfound that CD73KO mice exhibited higher CD4/CD8 ratio in periph -\neral blood (p <0.001), in parallel with the lower CD4/CD8 ratio ob -\nserved in heart and liver at 250 days post-infection (dpi), compared \nto the wild-type (WT) counterpart (p <0.001 and p = 0.052, respec -\ntively). The frequency of infiltrating HIF-1\u03b1+ CD4+ T cells and CD8+ \nT cells diminished in CD73KO compared to WT mice (p <0.05). In \nthe heart, a higher frequency of IFN- g+ CD8+ T cells was observed \nin CD73-deficient mice (p <0.05) in agreement with the intense infil -\ntrate perceived in histological studies. In addition, the echocardiog -\nraphy (ECO) analysis showed that cardiac functionality was altered \nin CD73KO mice (left ventricular systolic diameter/weight: p <0.05). \nIn the same way, in CD73-deficient liver, higher frequency of IFN- g+ \nCD8 T cells were observed (p <0.001), in accordance with the liver \ntissue damage evaluated by the analysis of the histology. On the \nother hand, in visceral adipose tissue, no differences were observed \nregarding the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in T cells in both groups of mice. \nHowever, a higher degree of infiltration was observed in visceral adi -\npose tissue from CD73-deficient mice.

However, clinically, it\u2019s difficult to \ndefine a therapeutic approach due to a lack of tools to determine \nthe phase a patient is going through. Our aim was to investigate the \nusefulness of plasma fingerprints as instrument for discrimination \nof pro or anti-inflammatory states in sepsis using MALDI-TOF tech -\nnology. For this, we used cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) murine \nmodels, which develop to an inflammatory phase during the 2nd \nday (D2) and an anti-inflammatory one on the 4th day (D4). The \nSHAM (SH) group was used as control. To characterize the different phases, hematologic, metabolic and immunologic parameters were \ndetermined in plasma. Also, plasma spectra were acquired by the \nMALDI-TOF technique. Un-supervised (Hierarchical K-means clus -\ntering) and supervised analyzes were performed to discriminate the \ndifferent phases from differential signals (peaks). Peripheral blood \nleukocytes count was decreased in CLPD2 whereas in CLPD4 \nwas increased associated to neutrophilia (Leukocytes (109/l): \nSHD2=7.7\u00b10.4; CLPD2=3.5\u00b10.6*. Neutrophils: SHD4=0.47\u00b10.11; \nCLPD4=2.59\u00b10.43&, &*p<0.01). Hepatic enzymes were increased \nin CLPD2 (ALT(U/L): SHD2=24\u00b12.3*; CLPD2= 92\u00b18.3*,*p<0.01). A \nmarked splenic lymphopenia and decreased antibody titer was ob -\nserved in CLPD4 (%CD4+cells:SHD4=18.6\u00b12.2; CLPD4=9.2\u00b10.9*. \nTiter (%): SHD4=100\u00b113; CLPD4= 4.0\u00b12.3&,*& p<0.01). Super -\nvised analyzes were performed to form groups of 5-20 peaks that \nbest differ between groups. Using hierarchical k-means algorithms \nthe best sets of values for each case resulted in an accuracy of 91% \ncomparing CLPD2 and CLPD4; 93% for CLPD2 and SHD4 and 80% \nfor CLPD4 and SHD4. These results show the CLP model can sim -\nulate both phases in sepsis, and the potential for plasma fingerprints \nobtained by MALDI-TOF as a tool to discriminate different phases \nin sepsis.\n422.

Brucella abortus  (Ba) is an intracellular pathogen which sur -\nvives inside these cells. Macrophages could be differentiated into \nclassical or alternative profiles, among others. We have previous -\nly showed that Ba RNA (a PAMP associated with bacterial viabili -\nty or vita-PAMP) activates but does not polarize macrophages per \nse. Given that B. abortus  can survive inside macrophages once a \nTh1 response is established, we aimed to evaluate if Ba RNA could \ninterfere with M1 polarization. For this, human macrophages were \nstimulated with Ba RNA under M1 conditions (IFN- g+LPS) for 24 \nand 48 h. Ba RNA diminished the (IFN-\u03b3+LPS)-induced MHC-II and \nCD64 surface expression at 48 h (P<0.05), but it did not modify the \nsecretion of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines. This phenomenon \nwas not associated with an alternative activation of these cells (M2), \nas shown by unchanged DC-SIGN, CD163 and CD206 surface ex -\npression. The interference of M1 profile mediated by Ba RNA could \nbe biologically relevant as it was correlated with a reduced antigen \npresentation capacity to T CD4+ lymphocytes and Nitrogen Reactive \nSpecies production at 48 h (P<0.05). Additionally, we have previ -\nously shown that Ba RNA diminished IFN-g-induced MHC-I surface \nexpression on macrophages. We wondered if this phenomenon \ncould be reproduced in other cells susceptible of being infected \nwith Ba. For this, we treated the human brain microvascular endo -\nthelial cells (HBMEC) and the renin-expressing human pulmonary \nadenocarcinoma cells (Calu-6) with Ba RNA in presence of IFN-g. \nThis vita-PAMP could diminish the IFN-g-induced MHC-I surface \nexpression on these cells with 10 mg/ml of Ba RNA (P<0.05). This \ncould lead to an inefficient Ba infected-cells elimination by cytotoxic \nT cells. Overall, our results show that Ba RNA could alter the proper \nimmune response set to counterattack the bacteria which could per -\nsist in the host establishing a chronic infection.  \n423.

The innate immune response during \nCDI has been extensively explored, however, the phenotype and \nfunctions of T cells during CDI is only beginning to be understood. \nTo characterize the adaptive immunity during CDI, C57/BL6 mice \nwere treated with a cocktail of antibiotics and then infected with 105 \nspores of BI/NAP1/027 C. difficile  strain. The expression of the co -\nstimulatory molecules SLAM and ICOS was evaluated at 5 and 8 \ndays post-infection (pi) in lamina propria cells (LPMCs) and in mes -\nenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) lymphocytes stimulated with/without \nPMA/Inomycin for 4h. Infected mice showed typical CDI symptoms \n(diarrhea, hunched posture, and weight loss (p<0.01)), an increase \nin bacterial shedding (p<0.05) and in clinical score).\nOn both times studied, ICOS expression and ICOS+SLAM+ popu -\nlation on CD4+ and CD4- cells from MLNs (p<0.01) increased com -\npared to control mice. SLAM levels were upregulated only at day \n8 pi. A further characterization showed that more than 90% of the \nCD4- cells are CD8+ cells in MLNs, this was not the case in LPMCs, \nwhere less than half of the CD4- were CD8+. Interestingly, in LPMCs \nboth SLAM and ICOS were downregulated at day 8 pi. \nIFN- g produced by CD4+ and CD4- cells was only downregulated at \nday 5 pi in LPMCs. On the contrary, IL-17 production on CD4+ and \nCD4- cells from MLNs and LPMCs was increased in infected mice \ncompared to control on day 5 pi, with the highest levels on CD4- cells \nfrom LPMCs. At day 8, we observed a decrease of IL-17 production \nin CD4+ and CD4- MLNs cells and in CD4+ LPMCs.\nFinally, cecal contents from C. difficile -infected mice showed in -\ncreased IL-10 mRNA levels at 8 days pi. \nOur results suggest that C. difficile  modulates T cells functions. IL-\n17 is tightly regulated trough the course of infection. The decrease \non IL-17 production and the increase of IL-10 could be associated \nwith disease resolution.\n424.

Our aim was to evaluate the ability to induce a protective \nimmune response of a vaccine composed of a fragment of polymor -\nphic membrane protein D (PmpD) in a murine model of genital infec -\ntion by Ct. A fragment of PmpD was expressed in Escherichia coli \n(rPmpD).  The sequence was subcloned in a eukaryotic expression \nvector (pVAX1). Female C57BL/6 (n=5) mice were immunized with \na first intradermal dose of plasmid DNA and three rPmpD boosters, \nevery three weeks, by intranasal and subcutaneous route, simulta -\nneously. Twenty days after the last dose, the immunized mice and \nnot immunized mice (control group, n=4) were vaginally infected \nwith 1.5x105 inclusion forming units (UFIs) of Ct-GFP. Anti-rPmpD \nantibodies in sera (IgG, IgG1, IgG2c) and vaginal washing (IgG, \nIgA) were measured by indirect ELISA. Infectious bacterial proge -\nny released in cervical secretion was quantified by UFIs assay and \nfluorescence microscopy. Fourteen days post infection the uterine \nhorns were dissected for morphological analysis. The immunized \nmice produced a significant systemic IgG2c humoral immune re -sponse, indicating PmpD immunogenicity (two-way ANOVA, post-\ntest Bonferroni; p<0.0001 ). In the vaginal mucosa, the immunized \nmice showed an increase did not reach statistical significance in \nanti-rFPmpD IgG compared to the control group (Anova; p>0.05). \nThe immune sera from vaccinated animals decreased the percent -\nage of Ct infected HeLa cells when evaluating their protective ability \n(Mann-Whitney; p<0.05) . Moreover, the bacterial load decreased did \nnot reach statistical significance in vaginal secretions of vaccinated \nmice at day 7 post-infection (Mann-Whitney; p>0.05). The uterine \nhorns of vaccinated mice did not show morphological alterations as \ndid those from unvaccinated mice. The PmpD fragment is a potential \nvaccine candidate to develop a prophylactic strategy to the control of \nthe most common sexually transmitted bacteria.\n425.

As, Argentina.\nIntroduction : We have previously reported that immunization with  \na trans-sialidase-based antigen (TSf) formulated with a cage-like \nparticle adjuvant (ISPA) confers protection against Trypanosoma \ncruzi  (T.cruzi ). It has been shown that myeloid-derived suppressor \ncells (MDSCs) notably increase in several organs during mice acute \ninfection.\nAim: to study whether MDSC depletion could further improve the \nefficacy of the TSf-ISPA vaccine candidate against T.cruzi.\nMethods : 3 subcutaneous doses of TSf-ISPA were given to BALB/c \nmice before intraperitoneal infection with 1000 Tulahuen trypomas -\ntigotes. 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (50mg/kg) was given at different times \n(prior or during infection) to deplete MDSCs. Parasitemia was mon -\nitored at days 14 and 21 postinfection (p.i.). Survival was assessed \nuntil day 40 p.i. Flow cytometry was used to measure the % and \nnumber of MDSCs (CD11b+ GR-1+), CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells \nand CD11chigh dendritic cells in the spleen after 5FU treatment.\nResults : Survival after infection was always higher in TSf-ISPA-im -\nmunized and infected mice (TSf-ISPA Tc+ group) than control in -\nfected PBS-treated mice (PBS Tc+ group) (p<0.05). Early MDSC \ndepletion (5FU given 1 day before infection and at day 5 of infection) \nincreased survival of TSf-ISPA mice that received 5FU (TSf-ISPA \n5FU -1 and 5 Tc+) as compared to TSf-ISPA Tc+ mice). For instance, \nsurvival of TSf-ISPA 5FU -1 and 5 Tc+: 100%; TSf-ISPA Tc+: 40%; \nPBS Tc+ 0%; PBS 5FU -1 and 5 Tc+:0%. (p<0.05). Parasitemia lev -\nels correlated with survival, as PBS Tc+ mice treated or not with 5FU \nshowed higher number of blood parasites as compared to TSf-IS -\nPA Tc+ mice treated or not with 5FU (p<0.05). In addition, a trend \nsuggests that early 5FU treatment reduces parasitemia of TSf-ISPA \nvaccinated mice.\nConclusion: The fact that MDSC depletion improved the efficacy \nof the TSf-ISPA vaccine candidate raises the possibility of using this \npopulation as a target to further potentiate vaccine efficacy against \nT.cruzi . \n426.

Our stud -\nies indicate that in those individuals where the process evolves to a \nlarger pulmonary involvement, the regulatory action of the endocrine \nsystem is likely to promote a potentially unfavorable environment, \neither for the mounting of protective immunity, or the proper con -\ntrol of the inflammatory mechanisms accompanying such protracted \ncourse.\nChronic infectious diseases, as is the case of TB, and its persistent \npro-inflammatory response may lead to changes in the mucosal bar -\nriers affecting its integrity and hence the translocation of bacteria \nthat line the gastrointestinal tract. As such, individuals with chron -\nic diseases may have slightly increased levels of circulating Lipo -\npolysaccharides (LPS). Given this, we set out to quantify plasma \nLPS levels (chromogenic assay) in TB patients (n=39) and healthy \nvolunteers (Co, n=38) in addition to analyzing the possible correla -\ntions between LPS levels and other inflammatory mediators such as \nC-reactive protein (CRP, turbitest), interleukin-6 (IL-6, ELISA) and \nInterferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3, ELISA) as well as the Erythrocyte Sedi -\nmentation Rate (ESR).\nCompared to Co, plasma LPS levels were found increased in TB \npatients (p=0.009), as did levels of inflammatory mediators (CRP, \np<0.0001; IL-6, p<0.001; IFN\u03b3, p=0.0003) and the ESR (p<0.0001). \nFurther analysis according to TB severity, revealed that severe pa -\ntients had the highest amounts of circulating LPS (p=0.03 vs Co); \nwith moderate and severe cases showing much higher levels of \nCRP, ESR, IL-6 and IFN\u03b3 (p<0.0001, in all comparisons). \nCorrelation analysis showed that plasma levels of LPS from severe \npatients were positively associated with the amounts of inflammato -\nry compounds like IL-6 (p=0.03, r= 0.58) and IFN\u03b3 (p=0.01, r=0.8).\nThe higher levels of circulating LPS depicted by patients with severe \nTB may emerge as a contributing factor for the persistence of the \ngreater inflammation distinctive of advanced disease.\n427.

The extent to \nwhich antibodies contribute to enhanced infection with dengue vi -rus (DENV) and other flaviviruses is linked to complement levels. \nWe used monoclonal type-specific and cross-reactive anti-flavivirus \nantibodies of varying characteristics to assess the effect of Fc\u03b3R \naffinity on complement protein C1q modulation of antibody-depen -\ndent enhancement of DENV, focusing on the processes of viral \nentry.  We show that physiological concentrations of C1q modulate \nDENV-immune complex entry into the human monocytic cells lines \nK562 (Fc\u03b3RI- Fc\u03b3RIIhigh) and U937 (Fc\u03b3RIhigh Fc\u03b3RIIlow)  in an \nFcyR-dependent manner. Cell-based adsorption and internalization \nassays show that antibody specificity influences the mechanism of \nC1q modulation of enhancement. Using pharmacological inhibitors \nof viral entry, we describe the cell entry routes associated with C1q- \nmediated protection, varying antibody subclass and specificity. In \nconclusion, defining the conditions under which C1q interacts with \nimmune complexes and consequently limits ADE may lead the de -\nvelopment of vaccines that promote humoral immune responses \nwhere protective interactions predominate.\n428.

Nephrectomy constitutes the gold-standard \ntreatment, and recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been \napproved for the treatment of advanced RCC. As there are no val -\nidated molecular targets in RCC, we previously characterized the \nexpression pattern of ligands of the NK cell activating receptor \nNKG2D on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), tumor in -\nfiltrating lymphoid cells (TIL) and tumor cells from RCC patients and \nobserved that tumor cells exhibited high expression of MICA, while \nTIL (but not PBMC from RCC patients), exhibited high expression \nof MICA, ULBP3 and ULBP4. Additionally, tumor infiltrating NK cells \n(TINK) and CD8 T cells displayed increased expression of NKG2D \nand TINK exhibited a pronounced reduced degranulation and IFN- g \nproduction ability compared to PBNK from RCC patients, which in -\ndicates a functional impairment. In this work, and to gain a deep -\ner insight into these dysfunctional TINK in RCC, we further char -\nacterized TINK in terms of Tim-3 expression (exhaustion marker) \nand glucose uptake (using the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG \nin the absence or presence of cytokine stimulation) by multicolor \nflow cytometry. No differences were observed in the expression of \nTim-3 between PBNK from RCC patients and HD. However, TINK \nexpressed higher amounts of Tim-3 compared to PBNK from RCC \npatients. Moreover, compared to PBNK from HD, TINK and PBNK \nfrom RCC patients exhibited an impaired glucose uptake after cyto -\nkine stimulation. Although Tim-3 expression and glucose uptake in \nTINK did not reach statistical significance yet due to the low number \nof samples so far analyzed, our preliminary results unravel a likely \nnovel tumor microenvironment-driven suppressive circuit that con -\nnects Tim-3 expression, NK cell exhaustion, functional impairment \nand glucose uptake that drives NK cell into dysfunctional TINK and \nthat likely contribute to tumor progression.\n429.

There is not a success -\nful single treatment, thus it is necessary to search complementary \ntherapeutic option. Sulfated Hyaluronan (sHA) could be used as an \nadjuvant therapy due to its antiangiogenic and antitumor action in \nsome cancers. Moreover, monocytes/macrophages (Mo/M\u00d8) are \ncritical modulators of the tumor microenvironment and are able to \nenhance tumor angiogenesis.\nAim: evaluate the effect of sHA on Mo/M\u00d8 in lung cancer context.\nM&M: human PBMC cells were isolated by Ficoll-Percoll gradient \nand were treated with conditioned media (CM) derived from H1299 \n(NSCLC cell line) plus partial (sHA1) or total sHA (sHA3). Levels of \nTGF-\u03b21 (total and active) and IL-1\u03b2 were determined by ELISA as \nmarkers of pro or anti-inflammatory Mo/M\u00d8 phenotype. Endotheli -\nal cell (EC) migratory capacity toward CM of treated Mo/M\u00d8 was \nevaluated in Boyden chamber to evaluate angiogenic modulation. \nTreated Mo/M\u00d8 CM was used to analyze H1299 spheroid formation \nto analyze antitumoral effect. Statistical analysis: one-way ANOVA \nand Tukey post-test.\nResults: Mo/M\u00d8 biosynthesis levels of TGF-\u03b21 total and active and \nIL-1\u03b2 were non-significant after treatments. We observed a de -\ncrease of EC chemotaxis toward CM of treated Mo/M\u00d8 with both \nsHA in lung carcinoma context (p<0,05). Also, H1299 treated with \nMo/M\u00d8 CM previously incubated with sHA3 formed more aggre -\ngates and tended to diminish the number of spheroids (p<0,05).\nConclusion: our results indicate that sHA1 and sHA3 could modu -\nlate in vitro  the angiogenic behavior of Mo/M\u00d8 over EC migration in \nlung carcinoma context.

Bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem/\nstromal cells (MSC) are key components of the hematopoietic niche \nand are implicated in B-ALL pathogenesis and therapy resistance \nby several mechanisms. MSC exert an immunosuppressive effect \non T-cells; however, their impact on CD19-CAR T-cell activity is un -\nderstudied. \nAim: To characterize in vitro  and in vivo  the immunosuppressive \nand inflammatory properties of BM-MSC from pediatric patients with BALL (B-ALL BM-MSC) and their involvement in CD19-CAR T-cell \nactivity.\nMaterials and Methods:  We performed a detailed characterization \nof B-ALL BM-MSC, evaluated their immunomodulatory properties \nand their impact on CD19-CAR T-cell activity  in vitro using micros -\ncopy, ELISA, flow cytometry analysis and in vivo  using a preclinical \nmodel of severe colitis and a B-ALL xenograft model. \nResults:  While B-ALL BM-MSC were less proliferative than those \nfrom age-matched healthy donors (HD), the morphology, immuno -\nphenotype, differentiation potential and chemoprotection was very \nsimilar. Likewise, both BM-MSC populations were equally immuno -\nsuppressive in vitro  and anti-inflammatory in an in vivo model of se -\nvere colitis. Interestingly, BM-MSC failed to impair CD19-CAR T-cell \ncytotoxicity or cytokine production  in vitro using B-ALL cell lines \nand primary B-ALL cells.  Finally, the growth of NALM6 cells was \ncontrolled in vivo  by CD19-CAR T cells irrespective of the absence/\npresence of BM-MSC. \nConclusions:  Collectively, our data demonstrate that pediatric \nB-ALL and HD BM-MSC equally immunosuppress T-cell responses \nbut do not compromise CD19-CAR T-cell activity.\n431.

Laboratorio de Fisiopatolog\u00eda de la Inmunidad Innata (IB -\nYME-CONICET).\nNatural Killer (NK) cells are key effectors against tumor and virus-in -\nfected cells; however, evidence of a regulatory role is emerging in \ndifferent models of autoimmunity and viral infections. In tumors, we \nhave identified a subset of PD-L1-expressing tumor infiltrating NK \ncells in tumor-bearing mice and in patients with renal cell carcino -\nma (RCC). When PBMC from healthy donors (HD) were cultured \nwith the HLA class I-/- cell line K562, PD-L1 was up-regulated on NK \ncells. Direct tumor recognition by NK cells and monocyte (Mo)-de -\nrived IL-18 were required for PD-L1 up-regulation. As the cellular \nand molecular mechanisms that control PD-L1 expression on NK \ncells in RCC remain unknown, the aim of this work was to study \nPD-L1 expression in human NK cells upon RCC recognition and the \nunderlying mechanisms. To this end, we cultured PBMC from HD \nwith different RCC cell lines (ACHN, SN12c and 786-O) and after \n48h we evaluated PD-L1 expression on NK cells (CD56+ CD3- cells) \nby flow cytometry. PD-L1 was up-regulated on NK cells cultured with \nSN12c (p<0.0001) and 786-O (p<0.001) cells (but not ACHN cells), \nthe use of transwells showed a dependence on cell-to-cell contact. \nConsistent with previous results, PD-L1 up-regulation was partially \nreduced by IL-18 blockade (p<0.05). The presence of Mo-derived \nIL-18 in these cultures was confirmed by ELISA (p<0.05 for all cas -\nes). Finally, aiming to address the cellular mechanisms triggered by \ntumor cells that result in PD-L1 up-regulation, PBMC were cultured \nwith K562, SN12c or 786-O cells in the presence of pharmacological \ninhibitors of ROS, NOS or an ATP receptor antagonist, which had \nno effect on PD-L1 expression. However, the inhibition of autoph -\nagy and phagocytosis restricted PD-L1 up-regulation. Our results \ndemonstrate that RCC cell lines, through direct cell-to-cell contact \nand induction of Mo-derived IL-18, can induce the expression of PD-\nL1 on human NK cells, and suggest the requirement of autophagy \nand/or phagocytosis.\n432.

However, the \nfunction of CD4+ T cells within Tumor microenvironment (TME) \nremains uncertain. We previously demonstrated that tumors from \ntumor-bearing mice showed an important infiltrate of FOXP3neg \nCD4+ cells (Tconv) expressing CD39. CD39 is an ecto-enzyme in -\nvolved in the conversion of eATP to immunomodulatory adenosine. \nWe aim to determine the transcriptional profile of TI-CD39+Tconv \ncells. FOXP3-GFP mice (N=3), were injected with B16F10-OVA \ncancer cells. On day 17 the following TI-CD4+T cells were isolated \nby FACS: CD39+Tconv, CD39-Tconv and Treg. Then, we perform \nthe transcriptome sequencing by RNAseq. Principal component \nanalysis showed that all populations analyzed clustered separately, \nreflecting their differential transcriptional profile. To define the molec -\nular profile of CD39+Tconv cells, we searched for differentially ex -\npressed genes (DEGs). We found 449 and 153 significantly up and \ndown-regulated DEGs (p.adj<0.05, fold change=2), respectively, in \nCD39+Tconv compared to CD39-Tconv cells. Gene-encoding prod -\nucts related with cytotoxicity such as Gzmb, Gzmf, Gzmc, Prf1, Lyz2 \nand Eomes were up-regulated in CD39+Tconv. Moreover, Gene \nOntology Enrichment Analysis revealed an increased expression of \ngenes related to the following pathways: cytolysis, granzyme-me -\ndiated apoptotic signaling, lymphocyte chemotaxis and regulation \nof NK cell mediated cytotoxicity, among others (FDR<0.05). Com -\nparison of CD39+Tconv to Treg identified 244 DEGs up-regulated \nin CD39+Tconv. Siglech, Gzme, Gzmf, Crtam and Cd160 were \nfound to be among the most increased genes. In addition, we ob -\nserved that CD39+Tconv were enriched in pathways associated with \nmonocyte  chemotaxis as well as cell-matrix adhesion and cell killing \n(FDR<0.05). Altogether, this data suggests that in TME CD39+T -\nconv cells could acquire a transcriptional program associated with \ncytotoxic CD4+ T cells. \n433.

Departamento de Microbiolog\u00eda, Parasitolog\u00eda e Inmuno -\nlog\u00eda, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, \nBuenos Aires, Argentina. \nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and malignant \ncause of primary brain tumors in adults; it has poor prognostic, and \nmedian survival after diagnostic is less than a year which makes \nit a top priority for public health. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are a subtype of T lym -\nphocyte that induce apoptosis on stressed and malignant cells by \nsensing their increased expression of phosphorylated molecules. \nTheir ability to expand after stimulation and exert cytotoxicity over \ntumoral cells is being used in immunotherapy approaches against \ncancer. In this work we aimed to evaluate the modulation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell \nfunctionality by human GBM cell line U251 and how it could impact \nin their antitumoral response. For that purpose, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were puri -\nfied from human peripheral blood mononuclear cell, by using an an -\nti-TCR \u03b3\u03b4 MicroBead isolation kit. After purification, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were \nco-cultured with U251 cell line or it\u2019s conditioned medium during 24 \nhours in the absence or presence of phosphoantigen (E)-4-hydroxy-\n3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP, 1 \u00b5M). After incuba -\ntion, we analyzed the activation state of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells by measuring the \nexpression of CD69 and perforin by flow cytometry, and TNF-a and \nIFN-g production by ELISA.\n Our results indicated that HMBPP-stimulated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells exhibit an \nincrease in CD69 expression ( p<0.01, n= 9) and TNF-a and IFN-g \nsecretion ( p<0.05, n= 9) when they were co-cultured with the U251 \ncell line monolayers. Interestingly, intracellular levels of perforin were higher when \u03b3\u03b4 T cell were co-cultured with U251, either in \nthe presence ( p<0.01, n= 5) or absence ( p<0.01, n= 6) of HMBPP. \nSimilar results were observed when \u03b3\u03b4 T cell were incubated with \nsupernatant collected from U251 cell line monolayers. Our finding \nsuggests that the GBM cell line, U251, can modulate the differentia -\ntion towards the Th1-like profile in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells.\n434.

CD39 is an ecto-en -\nzyme that participates in the generation of adenosine, an immuno -\nsuppressive molecule that interferes with many anti-tumor immune \nresponses. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the impact of CD39 \nexpression on tumor progression and in the cellular composition \nwithin tumor microenvironment. For this, C57BL/6 wild type (WT) \nand CD39 KO mice were injected with B16F10-OVA tumor cells. \nWe evaluated tumor progression by measuring tumor volume at \ndifferent days post-injection (dpi, 7, 10, 12, 14 and 17). Additional -\nly on day 17 we evaluated different tumor\u2013infiltrating immune cell \npopulations by flow cytometry. We observed no significant differ -\nences on tumor volume at any dpi evaluated in both groups. While \nsimilar frequencies of tumor-infiltrating (TI) B cells, CD4+ T cells, \nmacrophages, NK, Dendritic cells was observed in CD39KO and \nWT tumor-bearing mice, CD39 KO mice exhibit higher frequency \nof TI-CD8+ T cells (p<0.0001) and higher % of TI-CD8+ T cells with \neffector phenotype (CD44+CD62L-) (p<0.05). Accordingly, CD39 \nKO tumor-bearing mice show higher frequency of OVA-specific TI-\nCD8+T cells than WT mice (p<0.01). We also evaluate the expres -\nsion of inhibitor receptors (iR) (PD-1, LAG-3 and TIM-3) as well as \ntranscription factors (TF) (EOMES, TBET, IRF-4 and TOX) related \nto exhaustion. We found no statistic differences in the frequency of \nTI-CD8+ T cells co-expressing 3 IR and FT from CD39KO and WT \nmice. Together our results suggest that the absence of CD39 may \nfavor the recruitment of CD8+ T cells with effector phenotype into \nthe tumor microenvironment, reinforcing the idea that CD39 could \nbe consider as a promising target in the anti-tumor immunotherapy.\nCD39, CD8+ T Lymphocyte, Tumor, Exhaustion.\n435.

Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Universidad de \nOxford, UK.\n*Equal contribution\nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the breast tumor \nsubtypes with the worst prognosis due to its aggressiveness and \nthe scarce treatment options available. B lymphocytes are arising \nas important players in antitumor immunity, but the way in which \nbreast tumors can affect B cell development in distant organs and \ntheir resulting effector functions have not been fully addressed. We \nfound that immature proB cells were enriched in the tumor micro -\nenvironment of TNBC patients compared to healthy breast tissue, \nHER2-overexpressed, luminal A, and luminal B breast tumors \n(p<0.0001) in a cohort of 141 patients (GSE65194). To support this, \nwe analyzed B cell ontogeny in mice bearing 4T1 tumors compared \nto tumor-free mice. We found a systemic alteration of B cell subsets, MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020176\nevidenced at different time-points in several organs by an increase \nin the frequency of immature B cell subsets (p<0.05) and a decrease \nin that of mature B cells (p<0.05). These findings might be explained \nby the downregulation of CXCR4 in bone marrow B cells (p<0.01), \nwhich promotes B cell retention in the bone marrow. Transcriptom -\nic analysis of Precursor/Transitional 1 (P/T1) splenic B cells from \n4T1-bearing mice showed higher expression of immunosuppressive \ngenes like Lgals1, Arg2, Tgfb2, and Th2-related genes such as  Il-13 \nand ll-33 (p<0.05) . Lgals1  mRNA was also higher in DLN B cells \nfrom tumor-bearing mice (p<0.05), suggesting that TNBC could be \nfavoring its own growth and progression via B cell-derived Galec -\ntin-1-dependent mechanisms. To summarize, our results show that \nTNBC induces an accumulation of immature stages of B cell devel -\nopment, both in patients and in a preclinical model. In addition, it \ntips the balance towards an immunosuppressive B cell phenotype \nwhich might favor tumor escape, characterized by high expression \nof Lgals1  mRNA that could be targeted to avoid tumor progression.\n436.

Many strategies have been proposed to \nproperly classify and quantify the immune infiltrate in a standard -\nized manner. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a routine technique \nin a pathology lab, which could provide with a lot of reliable, local \ninformation of tumor infiltration. The main goal of this work is to \nset up a quantitative multiplex IHC (mIHC) technique, developed \nby Tsujikawa et al.  To this end, we used a commercial colorectal \ncancer (CRC) tissue microarray (TMA) with 90 tumor samples of \ndifferent pathological stages. Briefly, the TMA was stained with se -\nquential IHC with iterative labeling and stripping steps for a total of \n12 markers. After standard IHC preparation, the primary antibodies \n(Ab) were detected by a peroxidase-labeled secondary Ab, visual -\nized by alcohol-soluble peroxidase substrate 3-amino-9-ethylcarba -\nzole (AEC). Then, the whole-slide was digitally scanned. Iterative \nstaining was achieved by AEC washing slides in ethanol, followed \nby Ab stripping. Once the 12 stains were obtained, digital images \nwere processed with a computational image analysis workflow and \nthe serial images obtained from the same slide were aligned using \nMatLab software. Then Fiji software was used to extract the AEC \nand hematoxylin color information of the coregistered images by \ncolor deconvolution algorithms. Finally, images were converted to \ngrayscale and visualized as pseudo-colored images. Our prelimi -\nnary data has allowed us to sequentially stain the CRC samples with \na panel of 12 biomarkers (CD45, CD3, CD8, CD20, CD56, TBET, \nGATA 3, RORgT, FOXP3, PD1, PDL1, and PANCK), to characterize \ntotal leukocytes, total T cells and some subpopulations (CD8+, Th0, \nTh1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells), B cells an NK cells. We expect to \nset up a useful platform that will provide a tool to benefit patient \npersonalized attention.\n437.

We found that the SKI-II \nsphingosine kinase inhibitor not only acts on the leukemic clone, it \nalso affects the survival of non-leukemic lymphocytes affecting tu -\nmoral microenvironment, mechanism mediated by both sphingosine \nkinases. Previously, we reported that autologous activation of T cells \ninduces CLL drugs resistance. In this study we evaluated the effect \nof SphKs inhibitors on the activation and proliferation of leukemic \nmicroenvironment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) \nfrom CLL patients were cultured with different doses of SKI-II or \nABC294640 (SphK2-selective inhibitor). PBMCs of CLL patients \nwere cultured on immobilized anti-CD3 moAbs (\u03b1CD3) to induce \nactivation and proliferation of T cells, or in the presence of a TLR-9 \nagonist: CpG to induce the activation of B cells. We found that  the \nplasma concentration of 15 \u00b5M for both inhibitors reduces the ex -\npression of activation markers (CD69 and CD25) of activated T cells \n(n=20 p<0.0001), and also reduces proliferation (n=15, p<0.0001) \nby CFSE dilution assay. As for B activation, CD69 downregulation \nwas only affected by treatment with ABC294640 (n=20, p=0.0016). \nSimultaneous analysis of leukemic B cells demonstrates a correla -\ntion between increased survival in response to inhibitor therapy and \nthe worst prognostic clinical profile, Binet B-C (n=30, p<0.0001). \nFinally, we tested generation of CLL resistance to ABT-199 (veneto -\nclax), induced by T cells activation, cultivating PBMCs in presence \nof one or the other SphKs inhibitors and managing to reverse this \nresistance (n=8, p<0.0001). We found that the inhibitors affected the \nactivation of the T cells that can give signals of survival to leukemic \ncells. Our results encourage the use of the combination of selective \nSphKs inhibitors together with venetoclax in CLL treatment.\n438.

However, surface gly -\ncosylation of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC) rests un -\nknown, and the influence of g alectins  on MDSC function remains \nunexplored.\nObjective:  We aim to characterize MDSC glycome and identify \nGalectin 1 (Gal1) role in their pro-tumor activity.\nMaterials and Methods:  We differentiated mouse bone marrow \ncells and identify M- and PMN-MDSC subsets with antibodies \nagainst surface molecules. We used conjugated lectins and per -\nformed a structural study of N-glycans by HPLC. We incubated \nMDSC with recombinant Gal1 (MDSC-Gal1) and tested their activity \nby PD-L1 and IDO expression by flow cytometry, cytokines array, \nand co-culture with mouse T cells. We tested in vivo activity by adop -\ntive transfer of MDSC-Gal1 to Lgals1-/- mice bearing Gal1 KD CT26 \ntumors. DMedia\u00b1SD is informed.\nResults: M-MDSC displayed lower levels of surface \u03b12,6-sialyla -ABSTRACTS177\ntion, inhibitory of Gal1 binding, than PMN-MDSC (-2.81 \u00b10.42 \np\u22640.05). In accordance, Gal1 binding to M-MDSC was higher \n(2451\u00b1500 p\u22640.05). Yet both subsets had N-glycans ligands of Gal1. \nGal1 heightened expression of PD-L1 ( 3326\u00b1687  p\u22640.001 ) and IDO \n(18\u00b16 p\u22640.0 5) in MDSC. MDSC-Gal1 produced lower amounts of \nmacrophage attracting chemokines and higher levels of regulatory \ncytokines. MDSC-Gal1 further inhibited T cell proliferation (p\u22640.01) \nand activation. MDSC-Gal1 adoptively transferred to tumor-bear -\ning mice accentuated tumor progression, (301 \u00b185 p\u22640.05) immune \nevasion and decreased infiltrating inflammatory macrophages in \nthe tumor compared to MDSC control transferred mice (-0.48 \u00b10.29 \np\u22640.05).\nConclusion: For the first time, MDSC glycosylation profile is de -\nscribed . Our results indicate  that MDSC glycome renders them sen -\nsitive to Gal1, which stimulates the MDSC immunosuppressive and \ntumor-promoting activity. These findings provide us novel opportuni -\nties to develop biomarkers and MDSC-directed therapies in cancer.\n439.

However, IL-17also supports \nanti-tumoral immunity by potentiating CD8+ T and NK cell respons -\nes. Our aim is to determine the role of IL-17-signaling in tumor pro -\ngression dissecting pro- and anti-tumoral effects. First, we evaluat -\ned IL-17 receptor (IL-17Rs) expression in melanoma (B16-SIY) and \nthymoma (EL4-SIY) tumor cells. While both cells expressed varied \namounts of IL-17RA and IL-17RD transcripts, IL-17RC was detect -\ned only in B16-SIY. According to the different IL-17Rs expression \nprofiles, exposure to IL-17A in vitro resulted in different outcomes. \nB16-SIY showed an increase in the amounts of transcripts encoding \npro-inflammatory mediators (VEGF, HIF1a and N-cadherin, p<0.05) \nand no change in others (FGF1, MMP2, MMP9, PDL1). Remarkably, \nEL4-SIY only showed an increase in the amounts of PDL1(p<0.001). \nThen, we evaluated tumor growth in vivo in IL-17-signaling-deficient \nmice and in WT mice to determine the overall role of IL-17 in tumor \nprogression. Interestingly, compared to WT controls, IL-17 deficient \nmice showed augmented B16-SIY tumor volume  (p<0.05,18dpi) but \ndiminished EL4-SIY tumor volume (p<0.001,21dpi) at several days \npost-injection (dpi) . Finally, we evaluated tumor-infiltrating lym -\nphocytes (TILs) in B16-SIY and EL4-SIY tumors from both mouse \nstrains. The percentages of total and SIY- specific CD8+ cells within \nTILs obtained at day 18 or 21pi from both tumors were diminished in \nIL-17 deficient mice compared to WT controls(p<0.05), suggesting \nthat IL-17 signaling is required for the proper development of anti -\ntumor CD8+T cell immunity irrespective to its global effect on tumor \nprogression. Our results highlight that IL-17-signaling role in overall \ntumor progression may be influenced by tumor profiles of IL-17R \nsubunit expression together with IL-17 effects on antitumor inmunity. \nKey words: IL-17, IL-17R, anti-tumoral immunity,\n440.

This protein in known as an \nimportant regulator of actin cytoskeleton remodeling. LSP1 polymor -\nphisms or downregulation are considered risk factors for some types \nof cancer.\nIn order to study the role of LSP1 in antitumor immune response, we \nemployed the B16-OVA melanoma model. \nWe previously shown that B16-OVA tumor in Lsp1-/- mice grow sig -\nnificantly faster and bigger than in wild type (WT) controls. Also, tu -\nmors harvested from Lsp1-/- mice show a lower frequency of total \ninfiltrating leukocytes compared to WT mice. \nConsidering that LSP1 is expressed by leukocytes and endotheli -\nal cells, an in vivo migration assay was performed. WT and Lsp1-\n/- splenocytes were labeled with Cell Proliferation Dye eFluor 670 \n(3\u00b5M and 0.3\u00b5M respectively), mixed in a 1:1 ratio and adoptively \ntransferred into WT or Lsp1-/- tumor-bearing mice. We observed a \nlower frequency of Lsp1-/- migrant leukocytes in tumors developed \nin WT  and Lsp1-/- mice (p<0.01 and p<0.001 respectively) 48hr af -\nter transfection. However, no difference in migrant cells was found \nwhen tumor draining lymph nodes (dLN) were analyzed.\nTaking into account CD8+ T cells priming importance in antitumor \nimmunity, an in vivo  proliferation assay was performed, by transfer -\nring CD8+ T cells from OT I mice  to WT and Lsp1-/- tumor-bearing \nmice.  Transferred CD8+ T cells failed to proliferate in Lsp1-/- dLN \ncompared to WT dLN 48hr after cell transference (p<0.01). Addi -\ntionally, we observed that transferred CD8+ T cells in Lsp1-/- mice \ndisplayed a significantly lower activation pattern as measured by \nexpression of CD69 and CD44 (p<0.01).\nWe hypothesize that the impaired control of melanoma growth in \nLsp1-/- mice could be caused, by a reduced extravasation efficiency \nof Lsp1-/- leukocytes, combined with a defective CD8+ T cells prim -\ning in Lsp1-/- tumor dLN.\n441.

In particular, we analyzed single-cell \nRNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data of 48 biopsies from melanoma patients \nbefore and during anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 therapy and 6 bulk tran -\nscriptomic datasets from melanoma patients treated with BRAFi or \nBRAFi/MEKi. \nIn progressing to targeted therapies patient biopsies, we observed \nthat there is an increase in M2 macrophage infiltrate in relapsed \nbiopsies (p<0.05; T-test) estimated by MIXTURE and high expres -\nsion of the TGF-b/Galectin-1(Gal-1) axis while low levels of T cells \nactivation markers. Moreover, the expression of Gal-1 is increased \nat both RNA and/or protein levels in 4 pairs of human melanoma \nBRAFi-resistant cells and 1 pair of BRAFi/MEKi-resistant cells by \nRTqPCR and immunoblotting, respectively (p<0.05; T-test). On the \nother hand, our analysis of scRNA-Seq data of melanoma patients \ntreated with ICB revealed that macrophages of non-responding \nbiopsies upregulate a specific glycosylation-related signature and \nshow an immunosuppressive expression profile associated with \nresistance. We observed that these macrophages have an M2-like MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

To \nstudy the molecular mechanisms and test therapeutic strategies to \novercome cross-resistance, we developed an immunocompetent \nmouse model of resistance to BRAFi/MEKi in BRAFmut melanoma \nwhich mimicry the immune profile related to M2 macrophages seen \nin melanoma patients.\nWe hypothesize that there are Gal-1/glycan interactions that could \npromote an immunosuppressive microenvironment in BRAFi-resis -\ntant tumors, preventing subsequent response to immunotherapies.  \n442. (8) SOLUBLE TNF\u03b1 BLOCKADE OVERCOMES LAPA -\nTINIB RESISTANCE AND UNLEASHES AN INNATE IM -\nMUNE RESPONSE IN HER2+ BREAST CANCER\nBruni S1, Mauro FL1, Rold\u00e1n Deamicis A1, De Martino M2, \nMercogliano MF1, Elizalde PV1, Schillaci R1\n1Instituto de Biolog\u00eda y Medicina Experimental (IBYME-CO -\nNICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina\n2Weill Cornell Medicine\nLapatinib (L) is a dual EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in \nHER2+ metastatic breast cancer (BC), but its clinical benefit is less \nthan 30%. We showed that soluble TNF\u03b1 (sTNF\u03b1) induces trastu -\nzumab (T) resistance by upregulating mucin 4 (MUC4), a transmem -\nbrane glycoprotein that shields the T epitope on the HER2 mole -\ncule, and that women with HER2+/MUC4+ BC have worse survival. \nHere we studied the role of sTNF\u03b1 blockade in cell migration, tumor \ngrowth, and in the innate immune response in JIMT-1, a T and L-re -\nsistant HER2+ BC model. To block sTNF\u03b1 we used INB03, a TNF\u03b1 \ndominant-negative protein (DN). JIMT-1 cell migration was not pre -\nvented by L or DN treatment alone, but the combination of L+DN \ninhibited migration by 50% (p<0.001 vs control). When MUC4 was \nknocked down, L alone reduced cell migration and sTNF\u03b1 block -\nade did not further enhance this effect. In the in vivo setting, L+DN \ntreatment inhibited JIMT-1 tumor growth by 54% vs IgG, L or DN \n(p<0.001) in nude mice. Tumor immune cell infiltration analysis by \nimmunofluorescence and flow cytometry showed a higher activation \nand degranulation of NK cells and a decrease in myeloid-derived \nsuppressor cells in the L+DN group, regarding the control groups. \nTaken as a whole, we proved that sTNF\u03b1 blockade is able to over -\ncome L resistance, inhibiting cell migration and tumor growth. More -\nover, sTNF\u03b1 neutralization along with L treatment triggers an anti-tu -\nmor innate immune response. These findings highlight the potential \nuse of L+DN in HER2+/MUC4+ BC, especially in patients with brain \nmetastasis since L and DN both cross the blood brain barrier.\n443.

The vasoactive in -\ntestinal peptide (VIP) is an immunoregulatory peptide synthesized \nby trophoblast and decidual cells that promotes trophoblast (Tb) \ninvasion, vascular remodelling and functional shaping of decidual \nmacrophages (dMA) in first trimester placenta. Here we studied the role of VIP in human term placenta as a regulator of Mo and dMA \nfunction.\nPeripheral blood monocytes were isolated from non-pregnant \n(NON-P) and pregnant (P) volunteers and normal placental sam -\nples were obtained at term. Mo were treated in vitro  with VIP, or \nconditioned media from decidual explants (D) or decidual explants \ncultured with VIP [D (VIP)]. Mo or dMA isolated by positive selection \nwith magnetic beads were used to study efferocytosis with CFSE-la -\nbelled autologous apoptotic neutrophils by flow cytometry and their \nwound healing capacity on human endometrial stromal cell line \n(HESC) monolayers.\nNON-P Mo presented higher percentage of efferocytosis than P \n(34.5\u00b14.5 vs. 21.8\u00b13.3; p<0.05) which was accompanied by higher \nexpression of CD36. On the contrary, NON-P Mo were less effective \nin HESC wound healing than P Mo (24.7\u00b11.7 vs. 38.7\u00b13.1; p<0.05). \nRemarkably, conditioned media from D or D (VIP) restored the ef -\nfects. VIP increased TGF-\u03b2 secretion without altering TNF-\u03b1 or IL-\n1\u03b2 in dMA, as well as their efferocytic capacity. When Mo and dMA \nfrom the same patient were analyzed, D (VIP) increased efferocyto -\nsis  in Mo and dMA to a similar extent.\nThe results suggest that VIP might regulate Mo and dMA pheno -\ntypes directly or by regulating the secretion of decidual factors fa -\nvoring efferocytosis and wound healing with an increment in TGF-\u03b2 \nwithout changing pro-inflammatory cytokines at term.\n444.

B. abortus  has been shown to activate \ncells of innate immunity, inducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory \nfactors. However, B. abortus  has different mechanisms whereby it \nmodulates the immune response, in order to evade it and survive \nintracellularly. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is a protein \nkinase that regulates essential signaling pathways, regulating seve -\nral cellular functions, such as innate immunity, among others. The \naim of this work was to elucidate whether B. abortus  can modulate \nthe functionality of monocytes and macrophages through the acti -\nvation of mTOR. B. abortus  was capable to activate mTOR (eva -\nluated by flow cytometry) during the infection of human monocytes \nand murine macrophages (RAW 264.7). As heat-killed B. abortus  \nrecapitulates the effect, we concluded that bacterial viability is not \nnecessary to induce mTOR activation. A significant increase in the \nexpression of TNF-\u03b1 (p<0.0005), IL-6 (p<0.05), IL-1 b (p<0.005) and \nIL-10 (p<0.05), as well as metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 (p<0.0005) \nwas observed when infected-cells were pre-treated with rapamycin, \na pharmacological inhibitor of mTOR. Together, our results demons -\ntrate that B. abortus  activates mTOR, which negatively regulates the \ninflammatory response, potentially contributing to the escape of the \nimmune response, allowing B. abortus to survive within monocytes/\nmacrophages for prolonged periods, generating an infection. \n445.

The infection sta -\ntus was assessed by Anti-EBV VCA-IgM, VCA-IgG, EA-IgG and EB -\nNA1-IgG serology, defining 4 status: primary infection (PI), healthy \ncarrier (HC), reactivation (R) and not infected (NI). Viral load, IL1 ABSTRACTS179\nand TNF\u03b1 were assessed by PCR and qPCR. Latency pattern was \nevaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for LMP1, EBNA2 and \nBMRF1, and by EBERS in situ hybridization (ISH). Macrophage\u00b4s \ncharacterization was performed by CD68, CD163, and CD169 IHC, \nexpressed as positive cells/mm2. M1 profile was defined as CD68/\nCD163 >1.5 and M2 as CD163/CD68 >1.5\nFifty-two percent of the patients were HC, 27,0% PI, 14,9% R and \n6.8% were NI; 41.5% expressed Latency I, 31.7% Latency II, 12.2% \nLatency III, 14.6% Latency 0 and 14.6% also expressed lytic anti -\ngens; 89% of patients displayed M1 profile. CD68+ cell counts were \nhigher than CD163+ and CD169+ in the series and within groups \n(ANOVA p<0.05). CD68+ and CD163+ cells were statistically higher \nin IF region in the whole series and in subgroups (p<0.05 T test), \nwhereas CD169+ cells were statistically increased at the GC in the \ncohort, specifically in HC (p<0.05 T test). An increase in CD163+ \ncells was observed in patients with Latency II-III, when patterns \nwere clustered into 0-I and II-III (T test p=0.01). No correlation be -\ntween CD68, CD163, CD169 with TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 or viral load (p>0.05 \nSpearman) were proved.\nM1 polarization prevailed regardless of the infectious status or viral \nload. TNF\u03b1 and IL1 cytokines may not be involved specifically in M1 \npolarized milieu. In EBV-associated pediatric Hodgkin Lymphomas, \nwe described a M1 predominance, indicating that EBV infection \nleads to M1 macrophage polarization in spite of the lymphomagen -\nesis process.\n446.

Corticosteroids are the first line therapy \nfor patients with uveitis, but their side effects highlight the need for \nnew therapeutic approaches. Our previous studies demonstrated \nthat Lactobacillus plantarum  CRL 759 supernatant (LplS) was able \nto decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines production in LPS-stimu -\nlated ARPE-19 cells (human retinal pigment epithelium cell line). \nThe aim of this study was to investigate the effect of LplS in a murine \nexperimental model of uveitis induced by endotoxin.\nL. plantarum was cultured in DMEM medium at 37\u00baC 5% CO2; LplS \nwas obtained by filtration on 0.22\u00b5m membranes. To induce uve -\nitis, 130 \u00b5g LPS was injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice. \nLplS was administered as drops and Prednisolone (P) was used as \nanti-inflammatory control. The mice were divided into six groups: \nLPS (LPS injection +PBS drops); LPS+LplS (LPS injection +LplS \ndrops); LPS+P (LPS injection +prednisolone drops) and control \ngroups treated with PBS, LplS or P drops and a PBS injection. \nTwenty four hours after stimulation, the mice were sacrificed. The \nocular inflammation was assessed by slit lamp microscopy and clin -\nical scores were determined. From each mouse, one eye was used \nfor collecting aqueous humor (AqH) and the other was enucleated \nfor histopathological evaluation. Total proteins, TNF-\u03b1 and leukocyte \ninfiltration were determined in AqH.\nThe clinical score of mice treated with LplS was significantly lower \nthan the LPS group (p<0.001). LplS elicited a marked decrease in \nthe secretions and inflammatory reaction at the anterior chamber, \nand also the presence of these cells in the posterior segment. In ad -\ndition, LplS reduced TNF-\u03b1 (41%) and proteins (61%) concentration \nin AqH, compared to LPS group (p<0.05).\nLplS showed a significant anti-inflammatory effect and could be pro -\nposed as a potential therapy for inflammatory eye disorders.\n447.

Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn. CABA.Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus \nBrucella  that triggers a complex host response involving both innate \nand adaptive immunity. Monocytes and macrophages are not only \nthe first line of defence against Brucella  infection but also a main \nreservoir for the bacteria. Monocytes are recruited in large num -\nbers to sites where the inflammatory process exists and the micro -\nenvironment will condition their differentiation to distinct functional \nprofiles of macrophages and dendritic cells.  How Brucella  could \nmodulate this process remains unclear. The aim of this study was \nto characterize the phenotype and functions of monocyte-derived \nmacrophages differentiated in the presence of B. abortus . For this, \nhuman purified monocytes were cultured with MCSF in presence \nor absence (control) of heat-killed  B. abortus  (HKBa) for 5 days. \nExpression of CD40, HLADR and CD54 was quantified by flow cy -\ntometry. Cells showed a lower expression of CD54 and HLADR on \nmonocyte-derived macrophages differentiated in the presence of \nHKBa than in control (p<0,05). Moreover, these macrophages were \nunable to be activated when further stimulated with HKBa or LPS \nfrom E. coli , as they were unable to up regulate CD54 or HLADR. \nNext we analysed the ability of B. abortus  to modulate functional \naspects of monocyte-derived macrophages. For this, supernatants \nfrom macrophages cultures were collected and the secretion of \nIL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 was quantified by ELISA. Monocyte-derived macro -\nphages differentiated in the presence of HKBa expressed higher lev -\nels of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 than control (p<0,05). Collectively, our results \nindicate that B. abortus  affects the phenotype of monocyte-derived \nmacrophages decreasing HLADR and CD54 and increasing the se -\ncretion of proinflammatory cytokines. This phenotype could affect \nthe activation of T lymphocytes, cooperating with the evasion of im -\nmunity by B. abortus .\n448.

We have \npreviously demonstrated that B. abortus  is able to elicit neuronal \ndeath by activating microglia (with release of nitric oxide and proin -\nflammatory cytokines) and inducing primary phagocytosis. The aim \nof this work was to investigate the role of soluble mediators released \nby infected cells of the neurovascular unit in the modulation of this \nphenomenon. For this, murine astrocytes and human brain micro -\nvasculature endothelial cells (HBMECs) were infected or not with B. \nabortus  for 24h. After that, cell free culture supernatants were used \nto stimulate co-cultures of murine primary neuron/microglia during \n48h. Neuronal density was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. \nStimulation of neuron/microglia co-cultures with supernatants from \nB. abortus -stimulated astrocytes or HBMECs induced a significant \nreduction in the density of neurons comparing with non-treated \nco-cultured or treated with supernatants from non-infected cells \n(p<0.005 for astrocytes supernatants and p<0.05 for HBMECs su -\npernatants). Furthermore, supernatants obtained from infected cells \nincreased several microglia function as proliferation (determined \nby microscopy, p<0.05), secretion of TNF-\u03b1 (measured by ELISA; \np<0.005) and phagocytic activity (evaluated by phagocytosis as -\nsay with Escherichia coli ; p<0.005). In order to determine possible \nsoluble mediators involved in these phenomenon, we use mono -\nclonal antibodies to neutralize TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 cytokines in culture \nsupernatants of infected astrocytes. Neutralization of IL-6 prevented \nneuronal loss in microglia-neurons co-cultures ( p<0.05), where -\nas neutralization of TNF-\u03b1 did not ( p>0.05). Overall, these results \ndemonstrate that soluble mediators secreted by B. abortus -infected \nneurovascular cells activate resting microglia and this bystander ac -\ntivation could be involved in worsening the neuronal death induced \nby B. abortus .MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

Division of Immunology, Faculty of Chemistry, Biochemis -\ntry and Pharmacy, National University of San Luis, Argentina.\nMyeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a heterogeneous \npopulation of immature myeloid cells with the ability to suppress \nT-cell responses. Monocytic MDSC (Mo-MDSC) and polymorphonu -\nclear MDSC (PMN-MDSC) are the main subsets described. Yersinia \nenterocolitica  (Ye) is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes food-\nborne gastrointestinal diseases. In previous studies, we demon -\nstrated that Ye oral infection induces the expansion of MDSC. The \npurpose of this work was to investigate the MDSC sub-population \nthat exerts the suppressive activity and underlying the mechanism \nbehind it. Mice of the strain C57BL/6 were infected with Ye WAP-314 \nserotype O:8. On day 5 post-infection (p.i), MDSC were analyzed in \nbone marrow (BM), mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and spleen by \nflow cytometry. Furthermore , Mo-MDSC and PMN-MDSC were pu -\nrified from the spleen of infected mice and their suppressor activity \nwas evaluated in co-cultures with purified T cells. Nitric oxide (NO) \nproduction was analyzed by nitrite quantification in culture superna -\ntants. We found that MDSC expanded in BM and accumulated in \nboth MLN and spleen of infected mice, in contrast with uninfected \nmice (p<0.001, p<0.01 and p<0.01, respectively). However, mice \ninfected with Ye deficient in YadA, an essential virulence factor that \nmediates intestine colonization, presented lower MDSC accumu -\nlation in MLN and spleen, compared to Ye wild-type infected-mice \n(p<0.01, p<0.01, respectively). In contrast to PMN-MDSC, Mo-MD -\nSC from the spleen of infected mice showed suppression activity \non T cells. Also, NO production increased in the supernatants of \nMo-MDSC/T-cell co-culture, but not in those of PMN-MDSC/T-cell \nco-culture (p<0.01). We conclude that Mo-MDSC is the sub-popula -\ntion that  suppress  T cell response during Ye infection, and this action \nis mediated by a NO-dependent mechanism. Moreover, MDSC ac -\ncumulation in intestinal mucosa and spleen could be dependent of \nbacterial virulence factors, which are important for Ye invasiveness.  \n450.

For this, human pulmonary \nepithelial (Calu-6), and microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1) \nwere treated with pRNAs from ECO, KPN and PAE, and the result of \nthis stimulation was evaluated on PMN response.\nActivation of Calu-6 and HMEC-1 was induced by ECO and KPN-\nRNA but not by PAE-RNA, as determined by the increased ICAM-1 \nexpression by flow cytometry (FACS) (p\u22640.01). Also, CALU-6 and \nHMEC-1 released IL-8 after stimulation with ECO and KPN-RNA \n(p\u22640.001). Consistently, conditioned medium (CM) from both cell \nlines showed chemoattractant activity for PMN after stimulation with \nECO and KPN-RNA (p\u22640.001). Finally, CM from cells treated with \nECO and KPN-RNA induced PMN activation as determined by the increment in CD11b expression by FACS (p\u22640.01). \nMoreover, when PMN were treated directly with pRNA, CD11b up -\nregulation was induced only by ECO and KPN-RNA (p\u22640.05). Also, \nall pRNA were able to induce ROS generation (p\u2264 0.05). Finally, \nPMN migration assay revealed that ECO and KPN-RNA resulted \nchemoattractant (p\u22640.01). \nIn conclusion, ECO and KPN-RNA are capable of activating EpCs, \nECs and PMN. Also, they induce a response on EpCs and ECs ca -\npable of activating and attracting PMN to the site of infection. In \naddition, this study reveals that PAE-RNA constitute a poor stimulus \nin the context of a pulmonary immune response.\n451.

Our previ -\nous results showed that Kp sequence type 258, Kp carbapenemase \n(KPC) producer (Kp258KPC+), is able to impair the respiratory burst \nand release of NETs by human neutrophils (PMN). Now, a murine \nmodel of peritonitis was used, in order to evaluate if the subver -\nsion of PMN microbicidal functions represents a real advantage for \nthe bacteria. In a lethality test, the highest dose of Kp258KPC+ in-\njected (108UFC, i.p), did not cause any death 24h post-infection, \nwhile 107UFC of Escherichia coli  (Eco), used as control, was lethal \nin 71% of infected mice. Kp258KPC+ induced an important recruitment \nof leukocytes to the peritoneum within 24h, compared to Eco (Leu -\nkocytes/L: Kp258KPC+= 3.5x109 \u00b1 0.6; Eco: 2.1x109 \u00b1 0.4; p<0.05), \nmainly PMN (PMN/L: Kp258KPC+= 2.2x109 \u00b1 0.5; Eco= 0.9x109 \u00b1 0.1; \np<0.05). After 72h, mice infected with Kp258KPC+ showed a decrease \nin the number of PMN, but Kp258KPC+ counts persisted, even 7d after \ninfection, and spread to liver, spleen and lungs. Depletion of PMN by \ncyclophosphamide treatment increased by 50% the mortality due to \nKp258KPC+. However, despite the importance of PMN, immunocom -\npetent mice were unable to eradicate the bacteria and avoid their \ndissemination. As in human PMN, Kp258KPC+ did not induce large \namounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in murine PMN. More -\nover, Kp258KPC+ impaired ROS induced by Eco (%DHR+ PMN: Ctrl= \n15.1 \u00b1 3.4; Kp258KPC+= 17.7 \u00b1 3.6*; Eco= 40.4 \u00b1 4.2; Eco + Kp258K-\nPC+= 22.4 \u00b1 3.4*; *p<0.05 vs Eco). Despite the increased mortality \nin the absence of PMN, that may indicate a possible role of PMN in \ncontaining Kp infection, Kp258KPC+ managed to escape PMN-medi -\nated killing, and this could be related to the lack of ROS induction. \nIn conclusion, Kp has the ability to evade the immune response, \nallowing it to persist and disseminate.\n452. (179) PROSTAGLANDIN E2 (PGE2) ENHANCES EFFE -\nROCYTOSIS IN HUMAN MONOCYTE-DERIVED MACRO -\nPHAGES\nCabrerizo G, Paletta A, Di Diego Garc\u00eda F, Geffner J, Ceba -\nllos A, Remes Lenicov F\nInstituto de Investigaciones biom\u00e9dicas en Retrovirus y SIDA \n(INBIRS), Universidad de Buenos Aires - CONICET\nPhagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages is one key \nfeature in the resolution of inflammation. Recent studies have shown \nthat prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an immune mediator with recognized \ninflammatory properties, is also required for the initiation of the res -\nolution process. Here we investigated the effect of PGE2 on neutro -ABSTRACTS181\nphil phagocytosis by macrophages.\nHuman monocytes were obtained from blood buffy coats and dif -\nferentiated to macrophages by culture with M-CSF (50 ng/ml) for 7 \ndays. Macrophages were treated or not (control) with PGE2 (10-6 \nM) during the last 24 and 48 hours of culture. Polymorphonuclear \nleukocytes (PMNs) were purified and cultured in RPMI medium con -\ntaining 5% fetal bovine serum overnight to induce apoptosis (>75% \nannexin V positive). Apoptotic PMNs were stained with CFSE, add -\ned to macrophages for 1 hour and washed. Macrophages were then \ncollected and efferocytosis was measured by flow cytometry. We \nobserved that treatment with PGE2 promoted macrophage capac -\nity to engulf apoptotic neutrophils, as demonstrated by an average \n15% increase of phagocytic macrophages (treated vs control, n=10, \np<0,0001), and also an elevation of the number of engulfed cells \nper macrophage (MFI 10271 vs 7533 for CFSE positive cells, n= \n6, p<0,001). We confirmed this to be actual phagocytosis of neu -\ntrophils by confocal microscopy. The effect of PGE2 was specific \nof apoptotic cells since it was not seen when macrophages were \nincubated with fresh PMNs. Notably, the effect of PGE2 was also \nobserved even when macrophages were cultured with IL-4 (20ng/\nml) to promote a pro-resolution M2 profile.\nOur results suggest that promotion of efferocytosis by macrophages \ncould be one mechanism by which PGE2 contributes to resolution \nof inflammation.\n453.

Acetylcholine is \na neurotransmitter which can also modulate cell survival, prolifer -\nation, and differentiation in neuronal and non-neuronal cells such \nas immune cells, which has been referred to as a \u201cnon-neuronal \ncholinergic system\u201d. Objective:  This work aimed to elucidate the \ncholinergic system relevance in the interaction between dendritic \nand GBM cells and its relationship with the pathology. Materials and \nMethods:  Human U251 and U373 cell lines were co-cultured with \nhuman dendritic cells (DC) in the presence of cholinergic agonists \n(10-8M of carbachol/24h). We then analysed DC activation marker \nexpression by flow cytometry based on CD86 and HLA-DR. On the \nother hand, using datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GBM \nand LGG collections) we analysed the influence of the expression of \nmuscarinic receptors on the immune infiltrate of patients with GBM. \nResults : Cholinergic system increased the expression of CD86 and \nHLA-DR in DC co-cultured with U251 or U373 cell line, also, the \nimmune infiltrate analysis showed that the expression of muscarin -\nic receptors such as CHRM1, CHRM2 and CHRM4 are associated \nwith the presence of DCs in GBM and LGG in a significative way. \nConclusion:  Our findings suggest that the non-neuronal cholinergic \nsystem is present in GBM cells and could modulate their crosstalk \nwith the immune system, influencing the survival of patients with \nLGG and GBM.\n454.

We have characterized a vaccine candidate based on outer \nmembrane vesicles derived from Bordetella pertussis  (BpOMVs). \nThis candidate has shown to be safe and protective with a mixed \nTh1/Th17/Th2 immune profile. We have demonstrated that our vac -\ncine candidate is able to activate the inflammasome in THP1 and \nin murine BMDM with a dependence on NLRP3 and Caspase-11.\nIt is known that OMVs from different Gram-negative bacteria can \ncarry genetic material inside itself or membrane associated, regard -\ning BpOMVs there are no reported studies on this issue. One of the \nintracellular dsDNA sensors capable of activate the inflammasome \npathway is AIM2 (Absent In Melanoma 2). We here address the \npotential role of AIM2 in inflammasome activation by BpOMVs. We \nstimulated BMDM from AIM2-/- mice with 400ng of BpOMVs and IL-\n1\u03b2 secretion was measured in culture supernatant by ELISA. We \nobserved a decrease (p\u22640.001) in IL-1\u03b2 secretion from AIM2-/- cells \nunder BpOMVs stimulation in comparison to BMDM from C57BL/6 \nmice. We performed western blot analysis of caspase 1 induction \nin the same scenario and the levels of Casp1 were also diminished \ncompared to control. We therefore stimulated WT and AIM2-/- BMDM \nwith BpOMVs previously treated with DNAse and the levels of IL-\n1\u03b2 secretion were significantly diminished (p\u22640.001). GSDMD was \nidentified as a pore forming protein that is cleaved by caspase-1 or \n11 to mediate the release of interleukin IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b1. We tested \nIL-1\u03b1 secretion in culture media as a measure of GSDMD pore for -\nmation and found that lack of AIM2 significantly affects its secretion \nin comparison to control (p\u22640.05). Results indicate that our vaccine \ncandidate activates the inflammasome via the dsDNA intracellular \nsensor AIM2 in mice BMDM. Future work will focus in demonstrate \nif this is one of the innate mechanisms that orchestrates the adap -\ntive immune response responsible of the protective capacity of our \nvaccine.\n455.

Live attenuated vectors, like rare serotype Adenovirus, used \nas vaccine DNA-delivery system, improve immunogenicity and \nguarantee a strong and long-lasting response.\nConsidering these facts, we generated a vaccine based on rare se -\nrotype human adenovirus (Ad48) carrying Traspain gene, a novel T. \ncruzi  chimeric antigen developed in our laboratory. With the aim of \nstudying immune activation by this Ad serotype and the spatiotem -\nporal tracking of the antigen we developed an Ad48 carrying Tra -\nspain gene fused with the monomeric red fluorescent protein mS -\ncarlet and analyzed its performance. \nmScarlet tagged Traspain was constructed by traditional cloning. \nAd48-Traspain-mScarlet virus was obtained by homologous recom -\nbination in HEK-293 cells, 15 days post-transfection. \nSeven clones were isolated by agarose plaque assay and further \nanalyzed. Traspain-mScarlet gene was detected by PCR, in vitro  ex-\npression demonstrated by Western-Blot and Fluorescent Microsco -\npy in infected cells showed full cytopathic effect. \nThree brighter clones were compared employing a high-throughput \nimaging system ( IN-Cell Analyzer 2200 , GE). Clone 2 was selected \nbecause it showed a signal/noise ratio of 100 and 2-fold mScarlet \nMFI compared to other ones. Purification of this clone by sucrose \ndensity gradient ultracentrifugation, resulted in titers higher than \n2.108 TCID50/ml. Low rate of impurities were found by SDS-PAGE \nand A280/A260 ratio = 1.40-1.60.\nTraspain specific immune response was assessed by flow cytometry \nafter immunization of C57BL6 mice with two subcutaneous doses of \nthe virus. A strong antigen-specific CTL response was detected by \ntetramer staining of whole blood from immunized mice.\nIn conclusion, the recombinant viral vector Ad48 carrying Tra -\nspain-mScarlet was generated and its in vitro  and in vivo perfor -\nmance confirmed the feasibility of the vaccine approach.\n457.

TIM acquire a memory phenotype during their thymic matura -\ntion and are exported to SLO as a conventional T cell. TIM play a pro -tective role during the early phase of infectious processes as report -\ned for certain bacteria, viral and parasite infections. Our previous \nresults demonstrated that during T. cruzi  infection, a large number \nof TIM mature in the thymus due to local production of IL-4 and IL-15, \n2 cytokines responsible for their maturation/maintenance process. \nTIM functionally act in a TCR-independent way; instead they are ac -\ntivated through cytokines as IL-12 and IL-18.  By using OT-I mice \n(not RAG2 KO, that carry an OVA specific TCR in most of SP8 cells) \nwe could compare the expression of a large number of markers be -\ntween OVA tetramer+ (OVAt+) SP8 cells (not specific for the parasite) \nand conventional polyclonal SP8 cells simultaneously present in the \nthymus of control and T. cruzi  infected mice. Data demonstrate that \nOVAt+ SP8 cells expressed higher levels of CD44, CD122, CD5, \nCD69, QA2 and decreased levels of CD24 compared to convention -\nal SP8 cells while other markers like CD62L, PD-1 and CD5 seem \nnot to be differentially expressed (p<0,05). Moreover, this pattern is \neven more pronounced after T. cruzi  infection (p<0,05) demonstrat -\ning that OVAt+ SP8 cells adopt a TIM phenotype in and Ag-indepen -\ndent way after infection. Expression of S1PR1 and S1PR4, that al -\nlow mature SP8 thymocyte to be exported to SLO, is downregulated \nin the bulk thymocyte population from T. cruzi -infected compared to \ncontrol mice. In correlation with these data, exportation experiments \nperformed by labeling thymocytes with CFSE (using intrathymic \ninjection) demonstrated a significant lower number of CD8-CFSE+ \ncells in SLO of T. cruzi  infected mice (p<0,05). Our data contribute \nto understand the maturation and exportation process of TIM  that is \nstill poorly described in the scientific literature. \n458.

Despite the advances in \nsurgery and chemoradiation, the survival of GBM patients has not \nimproved significantly in the past three decades. Thymic stromal \nlymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine produced primarily by activated \nepithelial cells and it has been shown to be a key factor in maintain -\ning immune homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses at \nmucosal barriers. However, recent studies have found an expanding \nrole for TSLP in inflammatory diseases and cancer. \nThis work aimed to elucidate the relevance of TSLP in the inter -\naction between neutrophils and GBM cells. First, we evaluated the \nproduction of TSLP by tumor cells through RT-PCR and then, we de -\ntermined whether the TSLP treatment affects the cross-talk between \nneutrophils and tumor GBM cells. For those purposes, human U251 \ncell line or tumoral cells obtained from a GBM patient were co-cul -\ntured with human neutrophils. We observed that the U251 cell line \nor the primary cell culture incubated with Epidermal Growth Factor \n(EGF) produced TSLP (p<0.05). Sequencing of the PCR product \nconfirmed it was TSLP. Additionally, the neutrophils obtained from \nhealthy donors and from the GBM patient produced TSLP. Notably, \nwe observed a decrease in the apoptosis of neutrophils when they \nwere co-cultured with the U251 cell line or the primary cell culture in \npresence of TSLP. Finally, we found that U251 cell line and healthy ABSTRACTS183\nneutrophils expressed TSLP receptor (RTSLP) Our findings suggest \nthat TSLP is present in GBM cells and could modulate their cross-\ntalk with the immune system, particularly with neutrophils.\n459.

Res binds to \nadenylate cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1). CAP1 expression \nand Res-mediated effects are unexplored in NAFLD. \nAims : to evaluate CAP1 expression and Res-mediated modulation \nof CD69, IL-6 and phagocytosis in Mo and liver macrophages (LM) \nfrom NAFLD. \nMethods:  we included blood and liver samples from controls (Co, \nn=40) and NAFLD patients (n=30). CAP1 expression was studied by \nflow cytometry (FC). To evaluate CD69 expression, peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) +/- \nRes (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. IL-6 production was induced using LPS \n(20 ng/ml) +/- Res for 19 h. Phagocytosis in presence or absence \nof Res was evaluated by FC using fluorescent beads. Paired t test \nor Friedman test were used  to evaluate effects within experimental \ngroups, and unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney test for comparisons \nbetween groups. \nResults: CAP1 expression was higher in Mo and LM from NAFLD \nthan Co (p=0.002 and 0.022). Res partially prevented the PMA-in -\nduced increase in the frequency of Mo and LM expressing CD69 \nin Co (p= 0.005 and 0.012). Res partially prevented LPS-induced \nIL-6 production in Mo from Co (p=0.025). PMA-induced Mo CD69+ \nfrequency and LPS-induced IL-6 production were higher in NAFLD \nthan Co (p=0.016 and 0.001). However, Res-induced modulation of \nCD69 and IL-6 in NAFLD was not observed. Res induced an in -\ncrease in phagocytosis percentage in Mo from Co (p=0.008) but not \nfrom NAFLD.\nConclusion:  Res modulates activation, cytokine production, and \nphagocytosis in monocytes from controls but not from NAFLD pa -\ntients.

Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) sense ex -\nternal or endogenous danger signals and mount a robust immune response to maintaining intestinal homeostasis. We previously \ndemonstrated that lactobacillus increase Paneth cells and intestinal \nantimicrobial activity to keep this balance. Our aim was to further \ncharacterized the effects of probiotics on the intestinal epithelial bar -\nrier (IEB). Mice were fed with Lactobacillus casei  CRL 431 (Lc431), \nLactobacillus paracasei  CNCM I- 1518 (Lp1518) for 7 and 5 days, \nrespectively, or water. On day 8 mice were killed and samples were \nremoved.\nMice fed with the probiotics increased ex vivo  intestinal antimicrobial \nactivity against Staphylococcus aureus , Salmonella thyphimurium  \nand a multi-resistant drugs Klebsiella pneumoniae (p<0.05).  This \ncorrelated with increases of Paneth cells (p<0.05) and defensin-\u03b15 \nin the intestinal fluids (15,213 \u00b1 3,252; 25,216 \u00b1 803.0 and 26,724 \n\u00b1 860.4 pg/ml, Mean\u00b1SEM, for Control, Lp1518 and Lc431, respec -\ntively). This antimicrobial activity was boosted by the presence of the \npro-inflammatory cytokines: IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12 and IL-6 (p<0.05) \nand most interestingly, by the immunoregulatory IL-10, in the intesti -\nnal fluids of those animals. Animals fed with probiotics did not show \nincreases in the intestinal permeability assessed by FITC-dextran \nblood levels. The stability and function of the IEB upon probiotics \nadministration was also reflected by increases in the occludin and \ncadherin proteins in a semi-quantitative histological analysis. Finally, \nincreases in the Goblet cells (p<0.05) was determined in probiotics \nfed animals, regarding a conventional diet. \nProbiotics reinforce the IEB barrier and preserve intestinal homeo -\nstasis targeting several points, namely, Goblet and Paneth cells, \nantimicrobial activity of the intestinal fluids, balance between pro-in -\nflammatory/regulatory cytokines, and the joint between IEC. \n461.

In addition, neutrophils can \nregulate gd T cell activity. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the \nmost lethal primary brain tumor in adults. GBM is clinically highly \naggressive because of evolutionary dynamics induced by cross talk \nbetween cancer cells and a heterogeneous group of immune cells \nin tumoral microenvironment. We have previously reported that neu -\ntrophils, obtained from healthy donors, regulate gd T cell activation \ninduced by phosphoantigens. Now, we aimed to investigate whether \ngd T cells derived from GBM-bearing patient were susceptible to be \nmodulated by neutrophils. To achieve this purpose, gd T cells were \npurified from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, by using \nan anti-TCR gd MicroBead isolation kit. Neutrophils were isolated \nby dextran sedimentation. After purification, gd T cells were stim -\nulated or not with (E)-1-hydroxy-2-methyl-but-2-enyl 4-diphosphate \n(HMBPP: 10 \u00b5M, 60 min), and then were cultured with or without \nneutrophils. After 24 hours, we evaluated the activation of gd T cells \nby analyzing CD69 expression and IFN- a and TNF- g production by \nflow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. Our results showed that the \nresponse induced by HMBPP on GBM bearing patient-derived gd T \ncells, was reverted in presence of neutrophils. This was demonstrat -\ned by a decrease in the expression of CD69 and in the IFN- a and \nTNF- g production ( p<0.05). Of note, we did not observe significant \ndifferences in the capacity of gd T cells derived from GBM patient to \nrespond to HMBPP compare to healthy donors. Overall, our results \nshowed that activation of gd T cells obtained from GBM-bearing pa -\ntient was modulated by neutrophil in a similar way to that observed \nin healthy donors.\n462.

Despite antiinflamma -\ntory mechanisms are triggered, studies assessing the implication of \nsuch mediators, like IL-10, in HUS are scarce. Interindividual differ -\nences in IL-10 levels are related to genetic variants. Several reports \nhave linked the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1800896 \n(Legacy: -1082A>G), located in the IL10 promoter, to several dis -\neases. \nObjective:  The aim of this work was to evaluate the contribution of \nIL-10 and SNP -1082A>G to HUS severity. \nMethods: Blood samples were collected from HUS patients at the \nacute period and from healthy children (HC). Plasma was stored and \nmononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and cultured with Medium \nor LPS for 20h. IL-10 levels were evaluated in plasma and PBMC \nsupernatants by ELISA. DNA was obtained from PBMC and IL10 \n-1082A>G analysis was performed by allele specific-PCR.  \nResults : Circulating IL-10 levels were increased in HUS \n(Mean\u00b1SEM (pg/mL): HUS=60.9\u00b110.0***; HC=9.3\u00b12.1; n=18,17; \n***p<0.0001). PBMC from HUS showed a lower capacity to se -\ncrete IL-10 (Mean\u00b1SEM (pg/x105Mo): 764.1\u00b1679.7**/2320\u00b12111; \n**p<0.01). The presence of allele -1082G was associated with higher \nIL-10 production, both in HUS and HC (Mean\u00b1SEM (pg/105Mo): AA/\nAG+GG (HUS=1020\u00b1558/1938\u00b1620*; HC=2270\u00b11244/7674\u00b14568*; \n*p<0.05), as well as in circulating levels ((Mean\u00b1SEM (pg/mL): AA/\nAG+GG (HUS=38.9\u00b113.5/76.4\u00b112.5*; HC=5.9\u00b12.63/8.9\u00b12.5*; \n*p<0.05). Severe patients showed a tendency to be enriched in al -\nlele -1082G frequency (OR(CI95%) 3.46(0.7-18)). \nConclusion:  We showed that allele -1082G contributes increas -\ning IL-10 levels. Although circulating IL-10 was increased at HUS \ndiagnosis, PBMC from these patients showed a lower capacity to \nsecrete IL-10. Moreover, severe cases showed a tendency towards \nhigher frequencies in alleles -1082G suggesting an association with \nrenal failure\n463.

LSP1 is an important regulator of actin \ncytoskeleton remodelling. We have previously shown that CD4+ T \ncells from Lsp1-/- mice have a poorer proliferation than CD4+ T cells \nfrom wild type (WT) mice after antigen exposure in vivo and in vitro \nwith bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs).\nIn order to study the role of LSP1 in DCs to promote a CD4+ T \ncell-mediated response, we evaluated the capacity of Lsp1-/- DCs \nto present antigens in a context of major histocompatibility complex \nclass II (MHC II) . In vitro, BMDCs were derived from Lsp1-/- mice with \nFlt3-L . BMDCs were pulsed with soluble or particulated Ovalbumin \n(OVAw or OVAb, respectively), then stimulated with CpG-ODN 1826 \nand finally cocultured with CD4+ T cells hybridoma (TH3Z OT II). Af -\nter an overnight incubation, a significantly lower activation of TH3Z \nOT II cells was observed with Lsp1-/- BMDCs incubated with OVAw \n(p< 0.0001) and OVAb (p< 0.001) compared to Lsp1+/+ BMDCs . \nIn addition, Lsp1-/- BMDCs show a lower expression of CD40, CD80, \nCD86 and MHC II  molecules than BMDCs from WT mice after CpG-\nODN 1826 stimulus (p>0.05, p<0.05, p<0.0001, p<0.01 respective -ly). \nThese results suggest that LSP1 deficiency affects DC antigen pre -\nsentation machinery in MHC II context .\n464.

This is due, among other reasons, to our poor knowledge \non how fish immune system works. Herein, we used Russian stur -\ngeons (A. gueldenstaedtii ), an ancient non-teleost fish with high eco -\nnomic and ecologic value, to investigate how chronic stress affects \nthe innate immune response , by assessing the effect of long-term \nexposure to stressing temperatures on fish acute phase response \nand local inflammation. To that end, sturgeons exposed to tolerable \n(<24\u00b0C) or stressing (>24\u00b0C) temperatures were i/p challenged with \nlive Aeromonas hydrophila  (108 UFC/kg), and the serum levels of \ntwo acute phase proteins, Serum Amyloid A (SAA) and ceruloplas -\nmin (Cp), were measured by ELISA and an enzymatic assay, re -\nspectively. Bacterial challenge caused an increase in SAA and Cp \nlevels in sturgeons exposed to both temperatures, but this increment \nwas lower in chronic stressed fish. Moreover, a positive correlation \nbetween SAA and Cp was observed in infected fish. In addition, \nanalysis of the cellular composition of peritoneum by flow cytom -\netry allowed us to identify four distinct populations compatible with \nlymphocytes (LY), small-peritoneal-leukocytes (SPL), large-perito -\nneal-leukocytes (LPL) and complex-peritoneal-leukocytes (CPL). \nBacterial challenge led to an increase in total peritoneal cells and a \ndecrease in LPL percentage while stressing temperatures rose LY \nand reduced LPL percentages. The local inflammatory response to \nbacterial challenge was altered by chronic thermal stress, reducing \nLPL and LY and increasing SPL percentages. Analysis of the effect \nof chronic stress on reactive oxygen species production and phago -\ncytic activity of peritoneal cells is in progress. Overall, this work pres -\nents novel evidence demonstrating that chronic thermal stress alters \nsturgeon\u2019s inflammatory response at both systemic and local levels.\n465.

Here, \nwe analyzed the effects induced by high salt on neutrophil function. \nNeutrophils were isolated from human blood by conventional pro -\ncedures. We found that exposure of neutrophils to hypernatremic \nmedia (400 mOsm) for 30 min induced an early state of neutrophil \nparalysis characterized by a profound inhibition in the ability of con -\nventional agonists to induce an increased expression of CD11b, cal -\ncium transients, the production of IL-8 and the activation of the respi -\nratory burst: % inhibition > 45% for each analyzed response (n = 9, \np<0.02 for each response analyzed, 290 mOsm vs 400 mOsm). By \ncontrast, exposure of neutrophils to high salt for longer periods (18 \nh) resulted in the activation of neutrophils revealed by a high produc -ABSTRACTS185\ntion of IL-8 (35 \u00b1 32 pg/ml vs 3924 \u00b1 329 pg/ml, 290 mOsm vs 400 \nmOsm, respectively, n =14, p<0.0001) and a dramatic synergistic \neffect on the ability of LPS-stimulated neutrophils to produce TNF-\u03b1: \nneutrophils cultured at 290 mOsm with or without LPS or neutrophils \ncultured at 400 mOsm produced TNF-\u03b1 levels lower than 100 pg/\nml, while those cultured at 400 mOsm with LPS produced 938 \u00b1 172 \npg/ml (n = 4, p< 0.02). Moreover, long-term exposure of neutrophils \nto high salt also resulted in the induction of calcium transients and \nthe activation of the respiratory burst (not shown). Pharmacological \nblockade of p38 MAPK markedly prevented the stimulation of neu -\ntrophil responses by high salt without affecting its early inhibitory \neffects (% inhibition > 65 for IL-8 production, n=6). Our observations \nreveal that high salt induces a unique biphasic effect on neutrophil \nfunctions that includes a second phase characterized by a strong \nstimulation of neutrophil function.     \n466.

CABA.\nSevere COVID-19 is strongly associated to the development of a \nsystemic inflammatory response. It is well established that the acti -\nvation of monocytes, macrophages and platelets plays a critical role \nin severe COVID-19. However, the role of neutrophils has not been \ndefined. Here we analyzed the phenotype and function of peripheral \nblood neutrophils in COVID-19 patients. Neutrophils were purified \nfrom peripheral blood by conventional procedures (% purity >97%). \nIn a first set of experiments we analyzed the spontaneous produc -\ntion of IL-8 by neutrophils cultured for 18 h. Neutrophils from severe \nCOVID-19 patients produced higher levels of IL-8 compared with \nhealthy donors: 158 \u00b1 30 pg/ml (n= 12) vs 672 \u00b1 249 pg/ml (n=11, \np< 0.05). No significant differences were observed for patients with \nmild or moderate disease. Neutrophils from COVID-19 patients also \nshowed a higher expression of CD11b (n=10, p<0.0001 healthy vs \nsevere COVID-19 patients) and a higher association with platelets \nevaluated by flow cytometry: percentage of neutrophils associated \nwith platelets = 6.6 \u00b1 1% vs 18.4 \u00b1 7.1% (n=6, p <0.01). Moreover, \nwe found that plasma from severe, but not moderate COVID-19 pa -\ntients, induced higher levels of oxidant products by healthy donor \nneutrophils, compared with plasma from healthy donors: % DHR+ \ncells at 30 min of culture = 11.71 \u00b1 4.0% vs 34.3 \u00b17.8% (n=10, p \n<0.05, evaluated by DHR oxidation and flow cytometry). Interest -\ningly, the production of IL-8 by COVID-19 neutrophils strongly cor -\nrelated with two recognized markers of disease severity, the plas -\nmatic concentrations of LDH (n=26, p=0.0004, R=0.65) and D-dimer \n(n=25, p=0.0001, R=0.87), as well as with the national early warning \nscore (NEWS score), a clinical score used to predict in-hospital pa -\ntient mortality (n=20, p=0.049, R=0.146). Our study suggests that \nthe acquisition of an inflammatory signature by neutrophils might \nplay a role in the development of severe COVID-19. \n467.

This study \naddressed the immunopathological characteristics of neutrophils \nfrom acute COVID-19 infected children. \nMETHODS: Sixty  acute COVID-19 mildly infected children (1-14 \nyears-old) and 9 healthy infants were studied. A multiparametric flow \ncytometry from neutrophils was performed in whole blood. Levels of \nIL-1\u03b2 in supernatant culture from purified neutrophils and serum anti \nSARS-CoV-2 IgG were quantified by ELISA. \nRESULTS:  A low expression of CD11b (p<0.01), CD66b (p<0.01) \nand CD62L (p<0.001), three molecules involved in neutrophil mi -\ngration, was observed in COVID-19 neutrophils (n=33) compared \nwith healthy controls (n=9). Interestingly, COVID-19 neutrophils \nalso showed a higher expression of two inhibitory receptors LAIR-1 \n(p<0.01) and PECAM-1 (p<0.01). In addition, a higher expression \nof two activation markers was also found in COVID-19 respect to \nhealthy controls: HLA-DR (p<0.0001) and the high affinity recep -\ntor for IgG, CD64 (p<0.01). According to the functional association \nbetween the \u03b22 integrin CD11b/CD18 and receptors for IgG, we \nfound not only that the plasma levels of IgG antibodies directed to \nthe S protein of SARS-CoV-2 inversely correlated with CD11b MFI \n(p<0.01, r= -0.43),  but also directly correlated with CD64 (p<0.05, r= \n0.5). CD64 is able to mediate a positive feedback on the activation of \ninflammasome. Indeed, we found that neutrophils from children with \nCOVID-19 spontaneously produced higher concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 \ncompared with healthy donors and increase greatly after TLR7/8 ag -\nonist stimulation. \nCONCLUSION:  Neutrophils from infants with acute mild COVID-19 \nhave a distinct proinflammatory signature that could potentially com -\npromise their ability to migrate to peripheral tissues.\n468.

However, through the modulation of several signaling path -\nways, the parasite subverts the Mo polarization to favor its surviv -\nal. We have reported that T. cruzi  infection induces \u03b2-catenin and \nWnt/Ca++ pathways activation in Mo, with these pathways being \ncritical to sustaining intracellular parasite replication. Moreover, the \ninhibition of \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity (using CCT036477 or \niCRT14) or Wnt proteins secretion (using IWP-L6) modulates Mo ac -\ntivation status towards a more microbicidal phenotype, which does \nnot fully fit in the classically activated/inflammatory M1 one.\nIn the present study we evaluated the transcriptional profiles of \nnon-infected, and infected Mo previously treated with CCT, iCRT, MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020186\nIWP-L6 or LPS+IFN- g (M1) (n= 3 replicates), compared their tran -\nscriptomes with M1 and M2 signature genes and performed gene \nset enrichment analysis (GSEA). Hierarchical clustering analysis \nrevealed that infected IWP-L6 Mo are transcriptionally more similar \nto infected M1 Mo than infected CCT or iCRT Mo, which are clearly \nseparated from control Mo and non-infected ones. Infection with T. \ncruzi  up-regulated a M1-specific set of genes, while the inhibition of \nWnt proteins secretion or \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity showed \ndown-regulated expression of them. In addition, GSEA revealed that \ninhibition of Wnt proteins secretion or \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activ -\nity modulated the transcription of genes related to innate immune re -\nceptors (TLR, NOD), cytokine and chemokine signaling, apoptosis, \nantigen processing and presentation, metabolism, and phagocyto -\nsis, between others. These results confirmed through transcriptional \nanalysis our previous findings that during T. cruzi  infection Wnt sig -\nnaling contributes to modulate Mo polarization and function.\n469.

Its protein moiety is composed by \nEgAgB8/1-5 apolipoproteins, which belong to a cestode protein \nfamily capable of binding hydrophobic ligands. Its lipid moiety com -\nprises several lipid classes, including triacylglycerides, fatty acids \nand phospholipids. Various reports suggested that EgAgB is in -\nvolved in parasite immunoregulation based on its ability to modu -\nlate LPS-induced activation of innate cells in vitro . To go further on \nEgAgB immunomodulatory properties, we explored EgAgB effects \non bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) using native EgAgB \n(nEgAgB, immunopurified from bovine hydatid cyst) and the recom -\nbinant EgAgB8/1 (rEgAgB, prepared in insect cells). We found that \nnEgAgB and rEgAgB exhibited dose-dependent proinflammatory \neffects on BMDC. At concentrations higher than 1\u00b5g/mL, both nE -\ngAgB and rEgAgB induced IL6 and IL1 b secretion per se . Since sat -\nurated fatty acids are capable of triggering inflammatory signaling by \na TLR4-dependent pathway, we explored the involvement of TLR4 \nin EgAgB-induced cytokine secretion using a TLR4 specific inhibitor \n(TAK-242) and the LPS-inhibitor polymyxin B. Results showed that \nTAK-242, but not polymyxin B, strongly inhibited EgAgB-induced IL6 \nand IL12p40 production in BMDC. To analyze a direct interaction \nbetween EgAgB and TLR4, we assessed TLR4 dimerization, find -\ning that LPS, but not EgAgB, induced TLR4 dimerization along 120 \nmin stimulation. These results show that EgAgB behaves similarly to \npalmitate, that even though is unable to dimerize TLR4 it requires its \npresence to trigger inflammatory pathways. In addition to these ef -\nfects, nEgAgB and rEgAgB altered LPS-induced cytokine secretion, \ndiminishing CD40 expression and IL12p40 and IL6 secretion, while \nincreasing IL1 b production. Overall, results suggest that EgAgB ef -\nfects on BMDC are TLR4-dependent although might not be a conse -\nquence of direct interaction between EgAgB and TLR4.\n470.

However, the phenotype of microglial cells and the recruited \nleukocytes were not fully characterized.\nMethods: In this study, we assessed the phenotype of microglial \ncells and the recruited leukocytes to the brain, in response to sys -\ntemic TLR4 stimulation, by applying high dimensional flow cytometry \nanalysis. We used machine learning algorithms to detect changes in \nmorphology and marker expression in microglia, due to activation \nby systemic administration of LPS (LPS - 1.6 mg/kg, i.p. injections, \nn=4). After perfusion, we obtained brain cells suspensions, stained \nthe cells and eight parameters where simultaneously analyzed by \nconventional flow cytometry and bioinformatics algorithms imple -\nmented in R. \nResults:  We detected three populations of microglial cells based \non CD45 expression and cell size. After LPS-induced systemic in -\nflammation we observed changes in the microglial cell phenotype \nand size (p<0.01 and p<0.05). In addition, we observed increased \nfrequency of CD45hi inflammatory monocytes (p<0.001). Dimen -\nsional reduction (viSNE) and clustering confirmed these results and \nsuggested additional heterogeneity in the recruited cell populations. \nConclusions:  These preliminary results suggest the presence of \nmicroglial cell subpopulations that responded to peripheral inflam -\nmatory stimulation. Further research is required to better define \nthese populations either by increasing the number of cell markers \nstudied or by morphological and tissular characterization, to identify \ntheir pathophysiological relevance.  \nmicroglia, LPS, inflammation, TLR4, algorithms\n471.

ICGEB, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and \nBiotechnology.Trieste, Italy. \n2. Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. \nAIMS: To developed and test cell free, in vitro (iv) radiolabeling (RL) \nassays detecting infection time-dependent proteome alterations in \nmacrophage cytosols uncovering novel altered proteins and path -\nways. METHODS: Macrophages were mycobacterial infected com -\nparing live vs killed bacteria and time points. The cytosolic fraction \nwas studied for being the purest. Cell-free, iv RL phosphorylating \navailable sites in proteins and others nucleotide-based assays were \nused. The iv reactions were resolved in 1D and 2D gels compar -\ning staining vs RL patterns. Reproducibly (>95 % cases) altered \nproteins were identified by MS and WB. The n for iv assays and \ntreatments was 3 to 9. RESULTS: The assays were sensitive, re -\nproducible and quick. Many proteins were labelled but 2 NUCLEO -\nLAR proteins, C23 and B23, were detected in cytosols with a highly \nreproducible time-dependency of level alteration. Bacterial viabili -\nty was not required for triggering that, but >4 days post-infection \nonly live bacteria sustained it. MW alterations in both, but mainly \nC23, were compatible with partial cleavage to shorter fragments. \nThe same kinase iv phosphorylating both was unaffected in activity \nby infection. RL assays other than phosphorylation confirmed the \naltered levels. Coupled iv phosphatase assays and anti-P WB re -\nvealed the C23 in vivo phosphorylation status. For detecting minor \nC23 changes and fragments, RL was more sensitive or linear than \ngel staining or WB. C23 has reported roles in mRNA translation/deg -\nradation, in ribosomes, in hubs for kinases and NEMO, etc. B23 in \nribosome, PIDDosome and casp2 regulation. CONCLUSIONS: the \nassays tracked alterations in low-abundant cytosolic C23 and B23 \nforms and might be useful for: a) infection studies assessing their \nmultiple roles, b) for cancer (C23 as aptamer target and B23 in leu -\nkemia), c) for C23 kinase assays. The RL approach would serve in ABSTRACTS187\ntracking their intracellular trafficking and roles in nucleolar, cytosolic \nand membrane surveillance pathways\n472.

It is characterized by \na clonal proliferation of a population of CD5+ B lymphocytes that \naccumulate in the secondary lymphoid tissues, bone marrow, and \nblood. Some CLL patients remain free of symptoms for decades, \nwhereas others rapidly become symptomatic or develop high-risk \ndisease. Studying autophagy, which may modulate key protein ex -\npression and cell survival, may be important to the search for novel \nprognostic factors and molecules. Here, we applied flow cytometry \ntechnology to simultaneously detect autophagy protein LC3B with \nclassical phenotypical markers used for the identification of tumoral \nCLL B cell clones. We found that two patients with progressing CLL \nshowed increased expression of the autophagy protein LC3B, in ad -\ndition to positive expression of CD38 and ZAP70 and unmutated \nstatus of IGHV. Our data suggest that activation of autophagy flux \nmay correlate with CLL progression even before Ibrutinib treatment.\n473.

The David Geffen School of Medicine, University of Califor -\nnia, Los Angeles, USA\nBackground: Complex immune regulation is required to ensure a \nsuccessful pregnancy outcome. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) \nis an immunoregulatory peptide known to induce a tolerogenic ma -\nternal response. Moreover, VIP regulates folliculogenesis and ovu -\nlation as well as ovarian steroidogenesis. VIP KO mice are known to \nbe subfertile, so we aimed to better understand how VIP deficiency \naffects ovarian physiology and immune homeostasis.\nMethods: Animals: VIP Knockout KO (-/-), deficient HT (+/-) and wild \ntype WT (+/+) mice in estrus (defined by vaginal lavage observation) \nwere studied at 3 or 8 months of age. Serum hormones were mea -\nsured with immulite Xpi Siemens platform. Ovaries were examined \nafter histological staining, hormones quantified using RIA and IL-1 \nsecretion by ELISA. \nResults: Young KO mice showed cycling disorders accompanied by \nan altered P4/E2 ratio in serum and ovary in the day of estrus as \ncompared to WT mice of the same age. We also found histological \ndifferences between the ovaries, with an increase in secondary fol -\nlicles, less corpora lutea, and more atretic follicles ( p<0.05 Anova \nand Tukey\u00b4s Multiple test ) indicating ovarian failure. Moreover, we \nconfirmed that 25% of KO mice fail to ovulate and 50% could ovulate \nbut the oocytes were incompetent to be fertilized. After comparing \nyoung WT to reproductively aged WT mice we found, as expected, \nheavier animals with lighter ovaries and reduced E2 and P4 levels in \nserum of the aged group. On the contrary, when these parameters \nwere assessed in KO young mice, they were not unlike those of \nreproductively aged mice, showing an intense inflammatory ovarian \nmicroenvironment and foamy macrophages - signs of premature ag -\ning. The adoptive transfer of Foxp3+ cells to these animals resulted in selective recruitment of them to the ovary, in relation to other tis -\nsues, and an improvement in the pregnancy rate. \nConclusion: VIP contributes to ovarian homeostatic mechanisms re -\nquired for a successful pregnancy.\n474.

Since, conventional semen analysis \nprovides a limited prediction of male fertility potential, in this work \nwe evaluated the potential use of quantification of abundant seminal \nsRNAs as markers of assisted reproduction treatments outcomes. \nThese molecules are key regulators of physiological and pathologi -\ncal processes with a great impact on reproductive function.\nTo accomplish our goal, we performed a prospective study with \ncouples who underwent a ICSI treatments with donated oocytes at \nPROAR Medical Center between 2015-2019. Seminal samples from \nthese normozoospermic men were collected and seminal tiRNALys, \ntiRNAGlu, tiRNAGly and let-7 were quantified by RT-qPCR. The results \nobtained demonstrated that levels of all three tiRNAs but not let-7 \nare significantly elevated in seminal samples from cases with failed \nICSI cycles, suggesting a potential association between increased \nseminal tiRNAs and unexplained male infertility.\nTo further characterize the role of seminal tiRNAs in male infertility, \ncorrelation studies were also carried out. Interestingly, they showed \na negative association between them and seminal testosterone, \nhighlighting the involvement of these molecules in male endocrinolo -\ngy. Our finding also suggest that these molecules could play a role in \nmodulating male reproductive function in response to physiological \nstress since they showed significant associations with the degree of \nsperm DNA fragmentation in fertile men but not in cases with failed \nICSI cycles where seminal cortisol levels are altered.\n475.

Represents 15 million babies born preterm \neach year with mortality rates 40 times higher than term babies. It is \nwell known that infection-induced inflammation is a contributing fac -\ntor. This process involves a progressive inflammatory cascade with -\nin gestational tissues accompanied by influx of leukocytes. We have \nreported that treatment with Lactobacillus kefiri CIDCA8348 (Lk48) \nprevented PTB (88%) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PTB \nmice model. Given this, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms be -\nhind Lk48 protective role in PTB induction.\nC57BL/6 females were treated every 48h by oral gavage during a \nweek with Lk48 or vehicle. Next, females were mated with BALB/c \nmales. On gestational day (gd) 16, females were challenged with \nLPS. Tissue samples from uterus, decidua and placenta were har -\nvest 18h after LPS. Leucocytes influx was evaluated by flow cytome -\ntry and histological examination by light microscopy was performed. \nThe impact on vaginal microbiota was evaluated by a qualitative \nanalysis by PCR-DGGE and a gene diversity analysis from vaginal \nsamples. Treatment with Lk48, significantly lowered percentages of \nCD8+T cells as compared to control (t-test p<0.01). Percentages of \nLy6G+ neutrophils were also significantly lower in the uterus and \ndecidua of Lk48 mice compared to control (t-test p<0.001). Histolo -\ngy confirmed these findings.

Furthermore, Lk48 ameliorated changes in placental lab -\nyrinths circulation and thickening of interhemal membranes. DGGE \nprofiles allowed differentiation of experimental groups in two sepa -\nrated clusters, suggesting that Lk48 induced changes in the vaginal \nbacterial community composition.\nOur results show that Lk48 treatment prevents LPS-induced PTB \nin mice by reducing leukocyte infiltration and inflammation-induced \ndamage in reproductive tissue as well as modulating the vaginal mi -\ncrobiota.\n476.

Herein, \nwe analyzed the prevalence of CT infection of the male genital tract \n(MGT), seminal levels of inflammatory biomarkers and sperm quality \nin male patients attending an Andrology clinic.\nSemen samples were collected from 107 patients with symptoms of \nurogenital infection/inflammation or possible infertility. Assessments: \nuropathogens infections (PCR), spermiograms, leukocytospermia, \nleukocyte subpopulations (FACS), ROS and inflammatory cytokines \nseminal levels.

When classifying patients \naccording to inflammatory biomarkers levels, 50% (13/26) of CT-in -\nfected patients showed increased seminal levels of inflammatory \ncytokines, leukocytospermia and reduced levels of morphologically \nnormal sperm (p<0.05). Conversely, CT-infected patients with low \nlevels of inflammatory cytokines in semen (13/26) showed reduced \nfrequencies of CD4+ T cells and increased frequencies of B cells in \nsemen. Strikingly, CT-infection associated with significantly reduced \nseminal levels of ROS and sperm apoptosis regardless of the state \nof inflammation (p<0.05). \nOur results revealed a significantly high prevalence of CT infection \nof the MGT in young and middle-aged patients in our setting.

Immunological mechanisms seem to participate in their \ndevelopment. Unexplained infertility has also been associated with \nthese mechanisms. Paternal immunotherapy (PIT) is used world -\nwide as treatment for URSA, but protocols differ mainly in amount of \nmononuclear cells, routes of administration, or single versus several doses. Herein we report results from the use of PIT in a cohort of \n416 primary URSA, 92 secondary URSA and 298 infertile women. \nAll patients followed a multiple intra-dermal injection of paternal \nmononuclear cells until detection of more than 50% blocking activ -\nity in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR-Bf). Patients and controls \nwere followed during 2 years since their first consultation. Statistical \ncomparisons were done by two-tailed unpaired t-test and Fisher\u2019s \nexact test, considering differences significant when P<0.05. Primary \nURSA and infertile women showed a similar pattern achieving val -\nues of MLR-Bf above 50% after 3 PIT in 46% and 49% of patients, \nrespectively.  60% of secondary URSA patients reached the desired \nvalue after only 3 injections. When analyzing outcome as succesful \npregnancies, a live birth was present in 58% (n=242) of all prima -\nry URSA treated women vs. 23% in the control group (p< 0.0001, \nOR: 4.7, CI 95%: 3.3-6.6). Secondary URSA showed live births in \n61% of patients (n=56) vs 28% in controls (p< 0.0001, OR: 4.0; CI \n95%: 2.2-7.2). 33% of Infertile patients showed live births (n=99) \nvs 21% in controls (p=0.0009; OR: 1.9; CI 95%: 1.3-2.8). Analysis \nshowed that best results were obtained in women between 20-35 \nyears old.

An overall prevalence of HPV infection of 8% (9/109) was \nfound. 56% of these positive cases were LR-HPV and 22% HR-\nHPV. Remarkably, HPV-6 was the most frequently detected gen -\notype (44%). Other genotypes found were HPV-11, HPV-33 and \nHPV26/69/66. Strikingly, 67% of HPV+ patients were also positive \nfor Ct compared to 37% of HPV- patients, but this difference was \nnot statistically significant ( p=0.081).

AFB1 toxicity is related with its metabo -\nlization by cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A), which is induced by aryl \nhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation. AhR participates in immune \ntolerance control, regulating the differentiation of T cells to Tr1 or \nTreg regulatory T cells, among other mechanisms. Hence, this work \nwas aimed to assess probable changes in Tr1-like cell differentiation \ndue to AFB1 and FB1 exposures, and the AhR involvement in such \neffects. Spleen mononuclear cells (SMC) from mice with different \nAhR affinities (C57BL/6 and B6.D2N-Ahrd/J; background  C57BL/6), \nwere incubated up to 72 h with AFB1 (0, 5, 25 and 50 \u03bcM), FB1 (0, \n25, 125 and 250 \u03bcM) and both-toxin mixtures. Later, Tr1-like cell \n(CD4+, Foxp3-, CD25low/-, IL10+) percentages stimulated by TGF\u03b2 + \nIL27 and intracellular IL10 (flow cytometry in both cases), IL10 in \nculture supernatants (ELISA), and the CYP1A and AhR mRNA lev -\nels (qRT-PCR), were assessed.\nAFB1 and its mixtures increased CYP1A and AhR mRNA levels, be -\ning greater in the latter; whilst FB1 did not produce changes. These \ndata were correlated with the highest toxicities caused by the tox -\nin mixtures. Tr1-like cell differentiation were raised by both, AFB1 \n(25 \u03bcM) and FB1 (125 and 250 \u03bcM), although in a AhR-dependent \nway, or independently of AhR and TGFB + IL27, respectively. AhR \nwas also involved in the IL10 raise, which was altered only by AFB1. \nHowever, the mycotoxin mixtures did not modify the Tr1-like cell per -\ncentage, although they decreased the IL10 production under basal \nand Tr1-stimulating conditions in an AhR-dependent manner. In con -\nclusion, AhR is involved in the immunosuppression caused by AFB1, \nand in the immunotoxicity induced by the AFB1-FB1 mixtures; but is \nnot implicated in the FB1 effects on Tr1-like cells.\nSAFIS\nBIOINFORM\u00c1TICA, GENOMA, PROTEOMA, \nY BLANCOS TERAP\u00c9UTICOS\n480.

Recently, a new AQP4 isoform with a 29 aa C-terminal \n(Ct) extension (AQP4-Ex) generated by translational readthrough \nwas described. Crystalized AQP4-M1 (32-254 aa) lacks N-terminal \n(Nt) and Ct ends. Our aim was to model AQP4-M1 and AQP4-Ex \nby homology modeling to study and compare their properties by \nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Human AQP4 sequences \nwere obtained from UniProt (entry P55087). CBS-DTU tools were \nused for post-translational modification analysis. AQP4 crystalized \nstructure was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (entry 3GD8) \nand each Nt and Ct ends were modeled with PEP-FOLD 3 (RPBS \nWeb Portal). Peptides were linked to the 3GD8 AQP4 model to \nbuild AQP4-M1 and AQP4-Ex homotetramers by UCSF Chimera \nsoftware. A 10 ns MD simulation was run in GROMACS 2019 for \nboth isoforms embedded in a bilayer of lipid POPC molecules and \nsolvated with TIP3P as a solvent model. AQP4-Ex (352 aa) had a 100% identity with AQP4-M1. Ct of AQP4-Ex had only two Serine \nresidues (331 and 335) with high score for phosphorylation motif \nprediction. Homology modeling of AQP4-Ex showed that the extend -\ned Ct is a random coil. MD simulations evidenced that AQP4-Ex has \na larger mean square displacement and radius of gyration as com -\npared to AQP4-M1, indicating that AQP4-Ex would be less compact \nand stable. The distance from His201 to Arg216, representative of \nthe selectivity filter (AQP4-M1: 4.32 \u00b1 0.03 nm vs. AQP4-Ex: 4.27 \n\u00b1 0.03 nm, n=4, ns), showed that water permeability of these iso -\nforms should be similar. Bioinformatics tools allowed us to model \nboth full-length AQP4 isoforms for the first time. MD simulations of \nAQP4-Ex provide valuable insights into its water permeation mech -\nanism, which agree with recent experimental observations.

(386)  IN SILICO  PREDICTION OF POTENTIAL ACTIVITIES \nAND TARGETS OF THE SYNTHETIC FLAVONOID 2\u2019-NI -\nTROFLAVONE\nVachetta VS, Marder M, Elola MT, Troncoso MF \nInstituto de Qu\u00edmica y Fisicoqu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gicas (IQUIFIB, \nUBA-CONICET), Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, UBA. \nFlavonoids are polyphenolic compounds considered potential \nchemopreventive candidates for cancer treatment. We previously \ndescribed that the synthetic flavonoid 2\u2019-nitroflavone (2\u2019NF) inhib -\nits proliferation, survival and migration of 3 human triple-negative \nbreast cancer cell lines. However, the mechanisms underlying these \neffects remain elusive.\nHere, Molinspiration and SwissADME chemoinformatics software \ntools were used to evaluate 2\u2019NF pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness \nand medicinal chemistry friendliness. Prediction of Activity Spectra \nfor Substances (PASS) web tool was used to predict 2\u2019NF biological \nactivities. We also used SwissTargetPrediction, TargetNet, Random \nForest QSAR, SEA and SuperPred web services for predicting 2\u00b4NF \npotential targets. \nResults from Molinspiration and SwissADME software showed that \n2\u2019NF does not violate the \u201cLipinski\u00b4s rule of five\u201d for drugs, has high \ngastrointestinal absorption and penetrates the blood-brain barrier. \nPASS tool predicted the following activities (Pa>0.7): inhibition of \nhypoxia-inducible factor 1- a expression, kinase functions, ubiqui -\nnol-cytochrome-c reductase and aldo-keto reductase family 1 C4;  \nenhancement of TP53 and heme oxygenase-1 expression and \nmodulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1, CYP27A1, CYP7B1, \nCYP2E1) and complement anaphylatoxin (C3a/C5a) receptor activi -\nties. Moreover, poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase-1, tankyrase-1 and -2, \nandrogen receptor (AR), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), estrogen \nreceptor (ER), CYP1A2, CYP2C9, amine oxidase [flavin-containing] \nA and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4- a were simultaneously predicted \nby 3 web services as 2\u2019NF potential targets.\nThus, in silico  predictions revealed that 2\u2019NF has a favorable phar -\nmacological profile as a drug candidate. 2\u2019NF anti-tumoral effects \nmight be associated with apoptosis induction, modulation of CYP \nactivities, oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism of steroid hor -\nmones and WNT, AR, AhR and ER signaling pathways, as well as \npotential anti-angiogenic action.\n482.

The \nobject of our study was the text of all scientific publications indexed \nin ePMC, signed by Argentine authors and published between 1955 \nand 2019 (inclusive). The objectives were: i) to statistically analyze \nthe results of the search; ii) to discover, through data mining, non-ex -\nplicit - often hidden - information structures and patterns in the text. \nThe analysis was done through text mining (TM), developing auto -MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl.

We also worked \nwith the text of 70,798 abstracts. TM allowed to extract information \nabout journals, authors, and countries participating in the research, \nand the underlying information contained in titles and abstracts. The \nnumber of publications over time was correlated with Argentine eco -\nnomic parameters. The main publication media were detected, the \nnumber of authors signing each article was studied, and the coun -\ntries sharing authorships with Argentina were analyzed. The pa -\nthologies that were mentioned in abstracts were detected; also the \nsubstances used for their treatment, grouping them by action site or \nby action mechanism. The topics that were especially covered by \nauthors were found with unsupervised digital detection algorithms. \nThe automated workflows (specially developed for this study) can \nbe applied to other scientific or biomedical databases, to improve \nplanification on research in prevention and treatment of illness. The \nunsupervised topic detection could serve to analyze decisions of au -\nthors on research subjects and to detect advances and deficits of an \norganized scientific policy.\n483. (451) EFFECT OF MEMBRANE COMPOSITION ON EPI -\nTHELIAL SODIUM CHANNEL (ENAC) AND AQUAPORIN 1 \n(AQP1) FUNCTION.

Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eda y Biof\u00edsica Bernardo Houssay (Con -\nsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas - \nUniversidad de Buenos Aires)\nENaC is a major regulator of salt and water reabsorption in sever -\nal epithelial tissues. AQP1 is a membrane integral protein with key \nrole in transcellular water transport in response to osmotic gradients. \nBoth proteins are present in vascular endothelial cells but their func -\ntions in this tissue would not be related to their canonical functions. \nOur in vitro  experimental results strongly suggest that there is a re -\nlationship between them.\nThe characterization of lipid-lipid, lipid-protein and protein-protein \ninteractions is a key factor in understanding the modulation effects \nthat membrane lipids and proteins can have on each other. Using \nmolecular dynamics simulations (MDS) as a \u201ccomputational micro -\nscope\u201d we can characterize the interactions of membrane proteins \nwith lipids, matching, incorporating, and extending the information \nwhich may be obtained from experimental, structural and biophys -\nical studies. Homology modeling of ENaC was carried out with the \nUniprot sequence (P37088, P51168, P51170) with 6BQN as tem -\nplate on the Swiss-Model server. Subsequent refinement was car -\nried out through MDS. The system consisted of a lipid bilayer of \nPOPC:DOPC:DPPC:CHOL at different relative concentrations, the  \nAQP1 tetramer (PDB code 4CSK) and the modeled ENaC, in the \npresence of TIP3P type water molecules.  It was prepared using \nthe CHARMM-GUI Web-based graphical interface and CHARMM36 \nforce field. The MDS were performed with GROMACS 2019 pack -\nage and GROMACS tools were used for analysis of the following bi -\nlayer properties: the surface area per lipid, compressibility modulus, \nmass density profile, two-dimensional density maps of lipid distribu -\ntion and lateral diffusion coefficients. The bilayers properties were \nused to correlate the permeability of ENaC and AQP1 on electro -\nphysiology models with the GROMACS package. Additional studies \ninvolved the molecular docking technique to analyze the possible \nbinding modes of aldosterone with ENaC and its influence on chan -\nnel functionality.\n484.

Universidad Nacional de Quilmes.Introduction : Angiogenic gene overexpression has been the main \nstrategy in numerous cardiovascular regenerative gene therapy \nprojects. However, most have failed in clinical trials, due to, among \nother reasons, dose inadequacy and lack of potency. CRISPRa \ntechnology enhances gene overexpression levels based on the \nidentification of sgRNAs with maximum efficiency and safety. GPP \nsgRNA Designer and CHOP CHOP are the most widely used plat -\nforms for the prediction of sgRNAs, the scope of efficiency and sen -\nsitivity of their algorithms being partially uncertain. The objective of \nour study was to analyze the performance of GPP sgRNA Designer \nand CHOP CHOP for the design of sgRNAs in a panel of angiogenic \ngenes, in a changing genetic context such as successive versions \nof the human genome.\nMaterials and methods:  The top 20 ranked sgRNAs were provided \nby GPP sgRNA Designer (GPP) and CHOP CHOP (CHOP) for each \nof the following VEGFA, KDR, EPO, HIF-1A, HGF, EGF, PGF, FGF1 \ngenes from both GRCH 37 and GRCH 38 human genomes.\nResults:  The mean ranking variation in the 20 positions was greater \nfor GPP than CHOP in EPO (p <0.05), EGF (p <0.005), HIF-1A (p \n<0.005), PGF (p <0.001) and HGF (p <0.001), whereas it did not \nreach statistical significance in KDR, FGF-1 and VEGFA (Wilcoxon \nTest). Accordingly, the global accumulative change  analysis for all \ngenes was significantly greater with GPP than CHOP (14.5\u00b18.6 vs \n4.05\u00b12.28 AUC, p <0.001, paired t-test). The rearrangement anal -\nysis of ranking positions was clearly different between platforms  \n(GPP:-0.3187\u00b10.2698 vs CHOP:-0.0437\u00b10.0563, p <0.05, paired \nt-test).\nConclusion:  GPP sgRNA Designer proved to be more sensitive in \nestablishing the best sgRNAs in relation to genomic context modifi -\ncations. Second, CHOP CHOP shows a narrower classification re -\nordering. Therefore, GPP exhibits the best performance in sgRNAs \ndesign for a panel of angiogenic genes.\n485. (515) DATA PROCESSING FOR COMPARISON OF GENE \nEXPRESSION LEVELS FROM RAW DATASETS USING \nFREE SOFTWARE R IN HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINO -\nMA PATIENTS.\nBaffo E, Hidalgo F, Pariani A, Larocca C, Favre C.\nInstituto de Fisiolog\u00eda Experimental (CONICET-UNR), Facul -\ntad de Ciencias Bioqu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas, Universidad \nNacional de Rosario.\nMany datasets on mutations, changes in the number or expression \nlevels of genes, as well as clinics are now available for different \ncancers. Thus, organization in data banks, with comparison and \nvisualization tolos, is growing and useful for biomedical research. \nMoreover, the use of raw data has a great potential for specific bio -\nstatistical studies.\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most lethal cancer \nand it lacks effective therapy. Data analysis from patient databas -\nes can be useful to identify molecular markers, targets for potential \ntreatments, and to investigate hypothetical mechanisms.\nThe aim of this study was to process raw data from the \u201cThe Cancer \nGenome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma\u201d project (TCGA-LI -\nHC) dataset to analyze them with the free software for statistical \ncomputing R, and to compare the expression levels of genes in -\nvolved in an antimigratory AMPK-p53 axis that we study at the cellu -\nlar level: the different genes for the three AMPK subunits (PRKAA1, \nA2, B1, etc.); TP53; and EMT transcription factors SNAI1 and 2, \nwhich are p53 targets.\nFirst, bioinformatic analyses of TP53 mRNA expression with open \nsource online tools showed an increase in the overall survival in \npatients with low versus high TP53 expression: 55.1 months versus \n61.7 months, respectively (P=0.03). Besides, TP53 showed muta -\ntions (61% missense and 31% truncating) in 30.5% of patients.\nTo better analyze mRNA levels, the whole raw data was organized \nwith R, leaving only those of the genes of interest, separating in \nsamples of healthy and tumor tissue and matching those corre -\nsponding to the same patient. mRNA (RNA-seq Illumina) data were \nselected and compared. As an example, the median value of mRNA \nlevels for SNAI2 increased from 144.7 in healthy to 205.7 in tumor \ntissue (P=0.01, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test).\nThis methodology can be systematized to compare gene expression ABSTRACTS191\nin HCC patients with respect to non-tumor tissue, and association in \ntheir changes can also be analyzed.\nCARDIOVASCULAR Y RESPIRATORIO\n486.

Cells were loaded with Fluo-4 and line-scanned in a \nconfocal microscope to detect cytosolic Ca.2+ Pharmacological in -\nhibition of RyR2 was tested with 5 \u00b5M of both VK-II-86 and Dantro -\nlene. Tree groups of cells (control, VK-II-86 and dantrolene) were \nfield stimulated at 1 and 5 hertz. After 1 minute at each frequency \nelectrical pacing was stopped to record spontaneous Ca2+ release \n(Ca2+ waves).\nResults: We found previously undescribed features of subcellular \ndiscordant alternans such as its reversibility after returning to basal \npacing frequency and its instability promoted by the recruitment of \nout-of-phase Ca2+ release zones by its neighbors. A discordance \nindex (DI) is proposed (Standard deviation of local alternans ratio) \nand correlated with the degree of negative staircase with a Pearson \nr of -0.66 (n= 15). \nThe equipotent RyR2 inhibition obtained with VK-II-86 and dantro -\nlene was evident when Ca2+ waves frequency was significantly re -\nduced compared to control (ANOVA with tukey post-test). At both \nbasal and high pacing frequency only VK-II-86 promoted a signif -\nicant increase of DI (n=14-22 per group. ANOVA with tukey post-\ntest).\nConclusions: Subcellular discordant alternans are a reversible pro -\ncess induced by rapid pacing and can be characterized with a Dis -\ncordance index which correlates with transient amplitude-frequency \nrelationship and is sensitive to pharmacological RyR2 modulation. \nInterestingly, differential response to VK-II-86 and dantrolene was \nobserved, suggesting that RyR2 modulation and prevention of Ca2+ \nwaves occurrence can be reached with normal or high chance of \npromoting discordant Ca2+ release.\n487. (67) APELIN IS A MEDIATOR OF THE MYOCARDIAL AD -\nAPTATIONS INDUCED BY SWIMMING ROUTINE\nAlejandra  Yeves, Joshua Godoy Coto, Fiorella Cavalli, Eri -\nca Vanesa Pereyra, Claudia Irma Caldiz, Irene Lucia Ennis \n(Centro de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares)\nIntroduction.  Apelin is a short-length peptide that increases in \nresponse to exercise training in the myocardium of spontaneous -\nly hypertensive rats (SHR) improving cardiovascular vasodilation, \nantioxidant capacity, and mitochondrial function. However, the mo -\nlecular mechanisms underlying these actions have not been eluci -\ndated yet. We hypothesize that aerobic training, through the apelin \npathway, may attenuate oxidative stress and mitochondrial structur -\nal and functional alterations in the hypertrophied myocardium of the \nSHR. Aim. To explore whether a swimming routine or the exposure \nto exogenous apelin produces adaptations in the SHR myocardi -um. Methods.  The experimental group ?SR? performed an 8-week \nswimming routine and was compared with non-trained group, ?NT?. \nResults were expressed as mean\u00b1SEM and analyzed by Student\u2019s \nt test or ANOVA, as appropriate (p<0.05). Results.  Swimming train -\ning increased both apelin and APJ mRNA (apelin: SR: 121.7 \u00b1 3.3 \nvs NT: 100 \u00b1 5.3; APJ: SR: 117.8 \u00b1 5.6 vs NT: 100 \u00b1 5.29), and \nAPJ protein expression (%, SR: 211.2 \u00b1 38.3 vs NT: 100 \u00b1 3.1) in \nthe myocardium. The mitochondrial membrane potential (DYm) was \nless depolarized in response to training compared with NT (mV, SR: \n-173.04\u00b1 2.09 vs -155.13\u00b1 6.36). Exposure to exogenous apelin in -\ncreased myocardial superoxide dismutase activity (U/mg, 59.9\u00b15.19 \nvs C: 41.6\u00b13.07) and reduced reactive oxygen species production in \nisolated cardiomyocytes (%, 74.7\u00b16.8 vs C: 100\u00b19.14). The H2O2-in-\nduced drop of DYm in isolated cardiomyocytes from NT was prevent -\ned by 10 min-apelin exposure (0.98\u00b10.025 vs. control: 0.83\u00b1 0.025), \neffect canceled by the APJ antagonist, ML221, (0.82\u00b10.071). Con-\nclusions.  The swimming routine seems to up-regulate the apelin -\nergic pathway in the myocardium of SHR. The effects produced \nby exogenous apelin promoting antioxidant capacity and probably \nimproving the mitochondrial function resembles aerobic training ad -\naptations.\n488.

In previous studies, we have \ndemonstrated the presence of IR and increased EO in spontaneous -\nly hypertensive rats (SHR). Also, it is known that physical training \ndelays the progression of vascular disease and improves insulin \nsensitivity. These effects possibly involve modifications in adipose \ntissue (AT).\nObjective : to determine the effects of aerobic training (AE) on IR, \nOE and AT phenotype in SHR.\nMaterials and methods : SHR were randomly assigned to a seden -\ntary group (S) and another one subjected to a swimming routine for \n8 weeks (Ex). Oxidative stress was determined by T-Bars and O2- \nproduction measured by the lucigenin method. To study the insulin \nresponse, Glut4 expression and phosphorylation were measured in \nadipocyte membrane fractions and a glucose tolerance curve (GTC) \nwas performed. To determine changes in the phenotype of AT, his -\ntological sections were analyzed by light microscopy. Results are \nexpressed as mean \u00b1 SE and statistically analyzed by T-test, con -\nsidering p <0.05 as a significant difference.\nResults : AE decreased the OE determined by O2- production (23.12 \n\u00b1 11.27% S vs. Ex), accompanied by a downward trend in T-Bars. \nOn the other hand, AE increased the insulin- induced translocation \nof pGlut4 (46.29 \u00b1 21.44% (6), while no effect was observed in S(2). \nThis effect correlated with a decrease in the area under the GTC \ncurve (29.59 \u00b1 9.58 compared to group S). Finally, a transition from \nunilocular to multilocular AT was observed in group Ex, although the \nresults obtained so far, did not reach statistical significance.\nConclusion : we propose that AE is an effective strategy to reverse \nmetabolic parameters that are altered in a murine HT model, through \nmechanisms involving changes in AT.\n489.

WT and SAKO strain were subjected to transverse \naortic constriction (TAC), an experimental surgical model for pres -\nsure overload-induced PCH, known to be associated with CaMKII \noverexpression.\nCardiac hypertrophy parameters (transthoracic echocardiography) \nwere studied one month after the intervention. SAKO mice were \nmonitored up to 180 days.*p<0.05 according to paired t-Student test.\nOur data demonstrated that PLNKO mice had higher contractility, \nincreased relaxation and SR Ca2+ load, while S2814A mice have a \ncontractile behavior similar to WT.SAKO mouse myocytes showed \nan increase in RS Ca2+ load under basal condition.\nMoreover, WT mice developed CPH after 1 month of TAC (LVMI: \nd0: 3.26-0.23 vs d30: 4.47-0.37*; n=20), while SAKO mice only \nshowed an increase in LVMI 180 days after TAC (d0:3.78-0.28; \nd30:4.88-0.43 and d180:5.30-0.35*; n-6).Sham mice hearts showed \nno change.\nThe results allowed us to suggest that, in spite of sustained increase \nof SR Ca2+ uptake, prevention of diastolic RS Ca2+ loss during pres -\nsure-overload insult is sufficient to protect the heart by delaying mal -\nadaptive cardiac mass remodeling.\n490.

Centro de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (UNLP-CO -\nNICET).\nSeveral studies have pinpointed that induced thyroid dysfunction \nleads to cardiac and metabolic disturbances and might result in \nlong-lasting effects upon cardiovascular function in rats. Functional \nmitochondrial network is crucial to preserve cell viability and cardiac \nperformance in response to thyroid disorders. Located in the inner \nmitochondrial membrane, cardiolipins are vital for the optimal func -\ntion of numerous membrane proteins, playing an important role in \nenergy metabolism. There is evidence of the regulating effect of thy -\nroid hormones on cardiac lipidic profile. Recently, it has been report -\ned that IMM cardiolipin levels affect calcium handling by regulating \nMCU stability and abundance. The aims of this study were to exam -\nine: (1) whether thyroid hormones affect cardiac function by altering \ncardiac calcium handling in young rats and (2) whether these thyroid \ndisorders alter heart mitochondrial cardiolipin. \nMale Sprague\u2013Dawley rats weighing approximately 50g were ran -\ndomly assigned to one of the experimental groups: (1) euthyroid \nrats (received SC injections of 0.9 NaCl (0.1 ml/100 g body weight), \n(2) hyperthyroid rats (received SC injections of T3, 20ug/100g body \nweight) and (3) hypothyroid rats (received 0.02% methimazole in \ndrinking water). T3 and methimazole treatments lasted 60 days. \nAnimals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and hearts were \nrapidly excised. Cardiomyocytes from each group were isolated by collagenase-based enzymatic digestion. Free cytosolic Ca2+, sar -\ncoplasmic-reticulum Ca2+ content, cardiomyocyte shortening and \nrelaxation measurements were performed. Cardiolipins were iso -\nlated and identified by TLC. Cardiolipin quantification was carried \nout by measuring the levels of free orthophosphate (Pi) using the \nBartlett\u2019s technique. \nContractility alterations induced by thyroid disorders were associ -\nated with altered free cytosolic and sarcoplasmic-reticulum Ca2+ \ncontent. While hypo rats showed a reduced contractility associated \nwith a reduced intracellular Ca2+ content, hyper rats exhibited an in -\ncreased contractility correlated with higher levels of Ca2+. Hormonal \nimbalances also affected cardiomyocyte relaxation as revealed by \nalterations in both time to 50% relengthening and time to 50% Ca2+ \ndecay. While hypo rats showed an impaired relaxation associated \nwith an increased time to 50% Ca2+ decay, hyper rats exhibited an \nincreased relaxation correlated with a faster Ca2+ decay. The num -\nber of spontaneous releases per minute was significantly increased \nin cardiomyocytes of both hypo and hyper rats. Cardiac cardiolipin \ncontent was reduced in hypothyroid rats but it was increased in hy -\nperthyroidism. \nOur results confirmed that thyroid disorders affect cardiovascular \nperformance parameters such as contractility and heart relaxation \ntime. Furthermore, cardiomyocytes isolated from both hypo and hy -\nper rats had an enhanced proarrhythmogenic substrate. This could \nbe partially attributed to an increased Ca2+ leaking from the mito -\nchondria associated with a phospholipidic imbalance. Increased cy -\ntosolic calcium levels could activate electrogenic NCX which might \ngenerate a depolarizing current resulting in DADs and arrhythmias. \nMaintenance of euthyroidism is fundamental to preserve cardiac \nperformance. An imbalance in phospholipidic profile of the mito -\nchondrial membrane such as cardiolipin, is related to defects in the \nmitochondrial and cardiac function. T3-dependent cardiolipin signals \ncontribute to the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis and in -\nvolved Ca+2 handling.\n491.

The expression of phosphorylated \nforms of eNOS, PKC\u03b5, Akt and the content of cannabinoid receptor \n2 (CB2) were determined by western blot.\nResults:  CBD significantly decreased IS (7 \u00b1 1 % vs. 31 \u00b1 2 % in \nIC) and improved the post-ischemic recovery of myocardial function. \nAt 60 min of R, LVDP was 56 \u00b1 8 % and +dP/dtmax  55 \u00b1 8 % vs. 17 \n\u00b1 3 %  and 15 \u00b1 4 % in IC, respectively; LVEDP = 18 \u00b1 3 mmHg vs. \n52 \u00b1 4 mmHg in IC; -dP/dtmax = 58 \u00b1 9 % vs. 14 \u00b1 4 % in IC. The \nexpression of P-eNOS and P-Akt decreased approximately 30% of \nNIC value (considered as 100 %) in IC and increased approximately \n60% in CBD group. The expression of P-PKC\u03b5 decreased approxi -\nmately 50% in IC and increased a 40% in CBD group. The content \nof CB2 receptors diminished 30 % in IC hearts and increased 20 % ABSTRACTS193\nin CBD treated hearts.\nConclusions:  The data demonstrate that CBD reduces the cell \ndeath and systolic and diastolic post-ischemic dysfunction induced \nby ischemia-reperfusion. These beneficial actions appear mediated \nby Akt/PKC e/eNOS-dependent pathways through CB2 receptors.\n492. (129) CARDIAC NBCe1 OVEREXPRESSION EXERTS A \nDIRECT EFFECT ON VENTRICULAR ELECTRICAL AC -\nTIVITY\nDi Mattia RA1, Diaz Zegarra L1, Valverde CA1, Blanco PG2, \nPortiansky EL3, Jaquenod De Giusti C1, Aiello EA1, Orlowski A1 \n1Centro de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares, CONI -\nCET-UNLP\n2Servicio de Cardiolog\u00eda, Facultad de Veterinaria, UNLP\n3Laboratorio de An\u00e1lisis de Im\u00e1genes, Facultad de Veterina -\nria, UNLP-CONICET\nIntroduction:  Intracellular pH maintenance in cardiomyocytes is \ncrucial for the correct function of electrical activity and contractili -\nty. Prevention of acidosis relies on two sarcolemmal acid extruders: \nNa+/H+ exchanger and Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (NBC). There are \ntwo known cardiac isoforms of NBC, an electroneutral NBCn1 and \nan electrogenic NBCe1, (1Na+:2HCO3-). We have previously demon -\nstrated in rat and cat ventricular myocytes the existence of an anion -\nic current generated by NBCe1 that contributes to the cardiac action \npotential shape and duration.\nAim:  The principal aim of this research was to determine the con -\ntribution of NBCe1 in heart electrophysiology in an in vivo  mouse \nmodel with NBCe1 overexpression.\nExperimental design:  We attempted NBCe1 overexpression by \nusing a cardiotropic adenoassociated virus vector (AAV9-NBCe1) \ndelivered through a retro-orbital injection in male 3 months old mice \nand then performed a series of studies to assess ventricular elec -\ntrical activity including patch clamp technique on isolated cardiomy -\nocytes and electrocardiogram (ECG), using an AAV9-mCherry as \ncontrol. \nResults:  We performed ECG studies on both mice groups before \nand after 28 days virus injection and we found a significant reduc -\ntion in QTc interval duration of AAV9-NBCe1 injected mice com -\npared to control, that was achieved after 14 days of treatment and \nsustained through time (ms; AAV9-mCherry: 61.2\u00b12.4,n=5; AAV9-\nNBCe1*:53.8\u00b10.5, n=6; *p<0.01 vs AAV9-mCherry). Moreover, ac -\ntion potential duration at 50% of repolarization (APD50) was also \nsignificantly reduced on these isolated mice ventricular cells (ms; \nAAV9-mCherry: 17.7\u00b13.2, n=6; AAV9-NBCe1*: 10.4\u00b11.5, n=9; \n*p<0.05 vs AAV9-mCherry). No signs of cardiac hypertrophy were \nfound in any of studied animals. \nConclusion:  We have demonstrated for the first time that in vivo  \ncardiac NBCe1 overexpression has a direct impact on heart elec -\ntrophysiology by decreasing APD of ventricular cardiomyocytes and \nreducing QTc interval duration of ECG. \n493.

Switzerland \n3Centro de Qu\u00edmica Inorg\u00e1nica (CEQUINOR).CONICET.\nUNLP. La Plata. Argentina\nStructural modification of drugs is a strategy for improving their phar -\nmacological properties. Candesartan (Cand) is an angiotensin re -\nceptor antagonist widely used for hypertension treatment. We have \npreviously modified its structure by the addition of Zinc (ZnCand), \nan essential trace element that contributes to the maintenance of \ncell redox balance.\nIn this study, we analyze the antihypertensive effects and cellular \nmechanisms of action of ZnCand in comparison to Cand.For in vivo experiments, SHR male rats were treated with 10-13 mg/\nkg/day Cand or ZnCand for 6 weeks and the systolic blood pressure \n(SBP) was measured. For hypertrophy response, rats were moni -\ntored echocardiographically, then hearts (HW)  and body (BW) were \nweighed to calculate HW/BW, LVMI (left ventricular mass index) \n(LVMI) and LVM/TL (TL: tibial length). For in vitro procedures, trans -\nfected HEK293 cells with the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) \nwere coincubated with 0.1, 1 and 10 \u03bcM of Cand or ZnCand and \nTAMRA-Ang II, for competitive binding assay, or Ang II for ROS and \ncalcium determinations.\nZnCand produced slightly higher SBP reduction (33.5\u00b12.9%, p<0.05) \nthan candesartan (23.03\u00b13.5%, p<0.05) as well as the reduction of \nHW/BW (12.11\u00b10.11%. p<0.05), LVMI (14.76\u00b10.29%, p<0.05) and \nLVM/TL (15\u00b10.61%, p<0.05).\nThe competitive assay showed, at 10 \u03bcM, ZnCand, a higher bind -\ning effect on the AT1R (97.93\u00b10.39%, p<0.05) in comparison with \nCand (81.13\u00b11.5%, p<0.05). Besides, ZnCand decreased ROS \n(87.58\u00b11.3%, p<0.05) and inhibited the calcium intracellular flux \n(62.75\u00b13.6%, p<0.05) more effectively than Cand (20.98\u00b14.35% \nand 44.12\u00b14.32%, p<0.05, respectively).\nWe demonstrate that the introduction of zinc in the structure of \ncandesartan improved its effect on SBP reduction through a strong \ninteraction with the AT1R, ROS inhibition and decrease in calcium \nrelease. Besides, ZnCand regressed the hypertrophy. We conclude \nthat this drug might be a candidate for the treatment of hypertension.\n494. (225) CARDIOMYOCYTES ACUTE EXPOSURE TO HIGH \nGLUCOSE PROMOTE ARRHYTHMOGENIC EVENTS IN -\nDUCED BY CAMKII \nSof\u00eda L\u00f3pez, Marilen Federico, Guillermina Nuozzi, Matilde \nSaid, Alicia Mattiazzi, Julieta Palomeque\nCentro de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares\nThe regulation of glycemia is disrupted under certain metabolic con -\nditions as impaired glucose tolerance, metabolic syndrome and di -\nabetes mellitus; or even stress context, i.e. surgery, cardiac infarct. \nGiven that arrhythmias and calcium (Ca2+) mishandling due to, in \npart, Ca2+-Calmodulin Kinase II (CaMKII) hyperactivation, are pres -\nent in prediabetic and diabetic hearts we hypothesized that an acute \nincrease in glycemia causes Ca2+ handling abnormalities capable \nto trigger arrhythmogenic events in a CaMKII dependent pathway. \nWe used isolated mice cardiomyocytes from wild type (WT) and \nS2814A, (which have the S2814 residue of RyR2 mutated to A, un -\nphosphorytable by CaMKII), loaded with Fura 2-AM to evaluate in -\ntracellular Ca2+ handling by epifluorescence, Langendorff perfused \nhearts to measure developed pressure (DP) and monophasic action \npotential (MAP) and hearts homogenates to perform [3H]Ryanodine \nbinding assay and western blot to evaluate ryanodine receptor 2 \n(RyR2) activity and activation. \nThe change from normal glucose (NG) buffer (11 mM, 325.61mOsm) \nto high glucose (HG) buffer (25 mM, 339.26 mOsm) induced an in -\ncreased amplitude of Ca2+ transient (CaiT, 72.59\u00b117.29% of NG, \np=0.001) and 73.30% of cells presented arrhythmogenic events \nduring HG perfusion. To prove that it was not an osmolarity effect we \nuse a buffer supplemented with sucrose or choline chloride in the \nsame proportion. The change in osmolarity by sucrose or choline \nchloride did not produce any effect either in CaiT or rhythmicity. The \neffects of HG were prevented by treatment with a specific CaMKII \ninhibitor; AIP (CaiT 5.56\u00b13.89% of GN+AIP) and only 35.0% of cells \npresented arrhythmogenic events, and in S2814A mice myocytes \n(CaiT 23.99\u00b17.39% of NG and arrhythmogenic events 27.27%). \nMoreover, HG perfusion in the hearts increased DP (34.29\u00b110.02%) \nand produced ectopic beats with respect to NG perfusion. HG [3H]\nRy binding assays showed a significant increase in RyR2 sensitivity \n(HG; 1.05\u00b10.27 vs NG; 2.30\u00b10.38 \u00b5M) and maximal activity (HG; \n48.09\u00b12.35 vs NG;31.58\u00b11.98). We conclude that acute adminis -\ntration of HG induces changes in Ca2+ handling and arrhythmic \nevents, dependent on RyR2 activation by CaMKII.\n495.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the \navailability of hypertonic sodium chloride solution during the perina -\ntal period may induce a differential programming on cardiovascular \nresponses of adult offspring after an osmotic challenge.\nWe studied Wistar rats, with a perinatal manipulation (M) that cov -\nered dams from 1 week before conception until the 28 postnatal \ndays (PN) of the offspring. The experimental groups were: -M-NaCl: \nFree access to 0.45M NaCl solution, food and water); and -M-Ctrol: \nFree access to food and water. We evaluated in male and female \nadult offspring (60PN) the changes (\u0394), in the mean arterial pres -\nsure (MAP), the heart rate (HR), and diastolic-systolic arterial pres -\nsure (DAP and SAP) induced by 2M NaCl infusion.\nThe repeated measures ANOVA indicated that both, M-Ctrol and \nM-NaCl males increased the MAP (F7.133=36.786; p<0.001) after 2 \nM NaCl.  However, M-NaCl male offspring kept the MAP significantly \nhigher than the M-Ctrol during 25 min post-infusion (F7.133=3.007; \np=0.006); this pattern was also observed in DAP (F7.119=4.038, \np=0.001). In females, the 2M NaCl infusion induced an equal in -\ncrease of MAP in both groups (M-Ctrl and M-NaCl). The analysis \nof \u0394HR in response to \u0394MAP induced by 2M NaCl infusion showed \na significant effect of perinatal programming, thus, M-NaCl females \npresent a greater bradycardic response than M-Ctrol females (r=-\n0.80 vs r = -0.57; p=0.04); showing also a significant effect of \u0394HR \nat 18 mmHg increase (t6= 3.44, p = 0.014).\nThe data indicate that the availability of a rich source of sodium \nduring the pre/postnatal period induces a long-term and dimorphic \neffect on sodium overload induced cardiovascular responses of \nadult offspring.\n496.

CINDECA CONICET-CIC-UNLP.\nCannabis sativa oil has been used for different medical purposes like \npain relief or refractory epilepsy treatment. Its main pharmacological \ncomponents are \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol \n(CBD). CBD, through the endocannabinoid-system receptors (CB1 \nand CB2) has cardioprotective effects against inflammatory and ox -\nidative damage. However, the effect of THC and CBD on hyperten -\nsive cardiac hypertrophy (CH) remains unclear. In CH dysfunctional \nmitochondria may produce deleterious effects on heart function. \nThus, we tested the hypothesis that activation of the endocanna -\nbinoid system attenuates CH and improves myocardial mitochon -\ndria function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). To this aim, \n3-month old male SHR were randomized into treated (TR) (N=4) \nand control (CR) (N=4). Cannabis sativa oil was orally administered \nto TR for 1 month. Data are presented as mean\u00b1SEM and Welch?s \nt-test was used for statistical differences (p<0.05). CH, determined \nby left ventricular weight/tibia length ratio, was reduced by treatment \n(mg/mm, TR: 28.28\u00b10.58; CR: 32.31\u00b11.1, p<0,05). Analysis of cardi -\nac ultrasounds at the beginning and end of treatment showed in TR: \n24.7% reduction in LV mass (p<0,05) and a significant decrease in \nLV wall thickness (from 1,85 \u00b1 0,01 to 1,58 \u00b1 0,02) without changes in LV diastolic dimension and arterial pressure. Mitochondria mem -\nbrane potential was improved by treatment (in mV, TR: -165.9\u00b13.05; \nCR: -150.6\u00b14.47, p<0,05). Based on these results we propose that \na 1-month treatment with Cannabis sativa oil in SHR is effective \nto reduce CH and improve the mitochondrial membrane potential, \npossibly traducing into better mitochondrial function.\n497. (456) CELLULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE LOW \nCARDIOTOXICITY OF ISTAROXIME\nMar\u00eda Florencia Racioppi, Juan Ignacio Burgos, Malena Mo -\nrell, Mart\u00edn  Vila Petroff, Luis Alberto Gonano.\nCentro de investigaciones cardiovasculares Horacio E Cin -\ngolani.\nPharmacological Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA) inhibition induces Ca2+ \ncalmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII)-dependent cardiomyocyte \ndeath and arrhythmias. Istaroxime is a novel inhibitor of NKA with \nlow risk of Ca2+ triggered arrhythmias due to its additional capacity \nto accelerate Ca2+ uptake via sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase \n(SERCA). We aim to test if therapeutic concentrations of istaroxime \nimpact cardiomyocyte viability and to gain insight into its mecha -\nnisms.\n2 \u00b5M ouabain and 10 \u00b5M istaroxime promoted an equivalent inotro -\npic effect by perfusing rat ventricular myocytes and measuring cell \nshortening (T test. n= 15 and 23 respectively).\nCell viability was evaluated by morphological parameters after \n24 hours of culture at 37\u00baC in the absence and presence of 2 \u00b5M \nouabain and 10 \u00b5M istaroxime (percentages of cell viability: Control \n52 \u00b1 2.5%; Ouabain 2 \u00b5M 33 \u00b1 3%; Istaroxime 10 \u00b5M 46 \u00b1 3% re -\nspectively. ANOVA with Tukey post-test. n=7 per group).\nThe apoptotic index BAX/BCL-2 and CAMKII activity were quanti -\nfied by western blot in homogenates of rat cardiomyocytes incubat -\ned during 1 hour in control, ouabain 2 \u00b5M or istaroxime 10 \u00b5M. In \ncontrast to ouabain, istaroxime did not promote significant CaMKII \nactivation or cardiomyocyte apoptosis (ANOVA with tukey post-test. \nN=4 per group)\nWe explored diastolic Ca2+ release by confocal microscopy in Fluo-\n4 loaded myocytes after incubation with the indicated drugs. In con -\ntrast to ouabain, istaroxime did not significantly increase Ca2+ spark \nand wave frequency, but increased the proportion of aborted Ca2+ \nwaves. This lower Ca2+ wave incidence remains present in cells \nfrom PLB-KO mice, suggesting that relief on PLB-dependent SER -\nCA inhibition is not the only mechanism underlying istaroxime`s low \narrhythmogenesis as previously suggested.\nWe conclude that istaroxime reaches a significant inotropic effect \nwithout inducing CaMKII-dependent cardiomyocyte death, and new \ninsights are provided to explain low arrhytmogenesis.\n498.

However, the relationship between the patho -\nphysiology of PD and cardiovascular complications remains unclear. \nThis work aims to evaluate the survival, motor capacity, and cardiac \nperformance in a model of parkinsonism in Drosophila melanogaster \nthat harbors a loss of function microdeletion in the DJ-1-encoding \ngene. The absence of DJ-1 induces early-onset PD in humans.\nCanton-S flies (control) and parkinsonism model flies (park) were \nused. We carried out survival analysis and motor ability assessment \nby climbing tests. Heterozygous individuals of control and Park flies \nexpressing the reporter protein GFP in cardiac and pericardial cells \n(GFP flies) were used for heart contractility assessments by confo -\ncal microscopy. Heart rate and arrhythmicity index (AI) were evalu -\nated in 8 and 40 days-old flies. Survival curves were obtained using ABSTRACTS195\nthe Kaplan?Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank (Man -\ntel-Cox) test. Student?s t-test (two-tailed) was utilized for compari -\nson between two groups and ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey?s \ntest was utilized for comparison among three or more groups.\nThe lifespan of control and park flies did not differ significantly. How -\never, the climbing ability of the park flies decreased with age, espe -\ncially after day 25. Heart rate in 8 days-old park flies was lower than \nin aged-matched control flies. Age-dependent reduction in heart rate \nwas very similar in both groups. The AI only increased in 40-day \npark individuals. The described alterations in these parameters do \nnot seem to be associated with alterations in the activity of proteins \ninvolved in intracellular calcium handling, e.g. SERCA and NCX.\nConclusions: individuals with parkinsonism show decreased motor \ncapacity and manifest changes in heart rate and increased arrhyth -\nmogenesis.\n499.

Drosophila \nmelanogaster has been widely used as a model to study the patho -\nphysiology induced by several substances, e.g. nicotine. This work \naims to provide information about the effects of this component \nof tobacco in the heart. We explored the genetic relevance of the \ntwo subunits (\u03b11 and \u03b17) of the nicotine receptors in the cardiac \nresponse of Drosophila melanogaster exposed to nicotine. We eval -\nuated intracellular calcium handling, the phenomenon underlying of \nheart performance, by means of a cardiac targeted genetically-en -\ncoded reporter system, TinC-Gal4-UAS-GCaMP3. Seven-days-old \nadult flies expressing a siRNA targeted to the \u03b11/7 subunits of the \nnicotine receptor were compared to wild-type individuals to evalu -\nate the impact of subunits downregulation. A pulse of nicotine was \nspiked to the semi-intact preparation of the heart (1.69 mM, final \nconcentration) to exert acute effects on heart activity.\nThe addition of nicotine incremented the heart rate (89.14\u00b19.36 \nvs 107.86\u00b111.18 beats/min n=9-10) and accelerated the maximal \nvelocities of contraction and relaxation (d\u0394F/dtmax: 0.164\u00b10.02 vs \n0.213\u00b10.02; -d\u0394F/dtmax: -0.118\u00b10.015 vs -0.181\u00b10.015 n=9-10) \nand relaxation time in wild-type flies (0.187\u00b10.025 vs 0.12\u00b10.004 \nn=8). These effects were abolished when \u03b11/7 subunits of the nico -\ntine receptor were downregulated. Paired Student\u00b4s t-test was used \nfor statistical analysis, where p values<0.05 were considered statis -\ntically significant.\nThese results suggest that nicotine\u00b4s effect on cardiac performance \nmight be mediated by \u03b11/7 subunits of the nicotine receptor in the \nDrosophila Melanogaster\u00b4s heart. We planned further experiments \nto test if this can be reproduced in mammalian hearts, as for exam -\nple in mice.\n500.

However, the participation of mitochondria in this intervention \nhas not been clarified yet. Our objective was to study the effects of \nETZ on mitochondrial alterations produced by ischemia-reperfusion \n(Is-R). Isolated rat hearts, perfused by the Langendorff technique \nand after 20 min of stabilization (E), were assigned to the following \ngroups: 1) Control (C): they were perfused until completing 110 min; \n2) Ischemic control (IC): 30 min of global Is and 60 min of R; 3) \nETZ: 100 \u03bcM ETZ was administered during the last 10 min of E and \nthe first 10 min of R. To evaluate the participation of p38MAPK and \nPKC\u03b5, experiments were carried out in the presence of their inhib -\nitors SB202190 and celerythrine (Che), respectively, administered \nduring the first 10 min of R. Mitochondrial state was determined by \nchanges in light scattering decrease (\u0394DL) by the addition of 200 \n\u03bcM Ca2+, Ca2+ retention capacity (CRC, Calcium Green 5N) and \nmembrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m, Rhodamine123) in isolated mitochon -\ndria from the different groups. Mitochondrial fission was assessed \nby the content of P-Ser637-Drp1 by western blot (WB). The expres -\nsion of P-p38MAPK, P-PKC\u03b5, calcineurin A\u03b2 and P-HSP27 were \nalso evaluated by WB.\nETZ significantly increased \u0394DL (1.3\u00b10.2 vs 0.3\u00b10.1 a.u.) and CRC \n(266\u00b110 vs 5\u00b11 nmol/mg protein) and preserved \u0394\u03a8m (-141\u00b15 vs \n-95\u00b16 mV). ETZ increased the content of P-p38MAPK, P-PKC\u03b5, \nP-HSP27 and P-Drp1 but decreased calcineurin A\u03b2 expression. \nSB202190 and Che treatment abolished these changes and the pa -\nrameters reached values similar to those observed in IC.\nThese data show that ETZ decreases the mitochondrial state \npost-ischemic alterations and the fission process through intracellu -\nlar signaling pathways that involve p38MAPK/PKC\u03b5/HSP27 activa -\ntion and calcineurin A\u03b2 inactivation.\n501.

Statistical analysis: Results are expressed as \nmean\u00b1SEM, Student t-test or 2-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni \nposthoc test; n=4-6/group.\nResults: Protein content of BKCa and Kir2.0 was lower in SHR \ncompared to Wistar rats (BKCa: Wistar=1.1\u00b10.1 vs. SHR=0.7\u00b10.1*; \nKir2.0: Wistar=0.8\u00b10.1 vs. 0.4\u00b10.1*; *p<0.05). The maximal relaxant \nresponse of CNP (Emax: Wistar=54.8\u00b17.3 vs. SHR=57.6\u00b13.1) and \nthe negative logarithm of the concentration that induces the 50% \nof Emax (pEC50: Wistar=6.7\u00b10.1 vs. SHR=6.8\u00b10.1) were similar in \ndenuded rings between both groups. TEA abolished the vasodila -\ntor effect of CNP. IbTx and BaCl2 decreased Emax similarly (IbTx: \nWistar=36.1\u00b14.8**; SHR=33.5\u00b13.2##; BaCl2: Wistar=35.5\u00b13.6**; \nSHR=34.0\u00b13.2##; **p<0.01 vs. Wistar; ##p<0.01 vs. SHR) in \nboth groups. However, the pCE50 with IbTx was lower in Wistar \n(Wistar=6.3\u00b10.1**; SHR=6.8\u00b10.1; **p<0.01 vs. Wistar), while CNP \npEC50 was more affected by opening of Kir channels in SHR (Wis -\ntar=6.7\u00b10.1; SHR=6.4\u00b10.1##; ##p<0.01 vs. SHR).MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020196\nConclusion: The endothelium-independent vasodilator effect of CNP \nappears to be more sensitive to Kir blockade and less sensitive to \nBKCa blockade in SHR, although the expression of both channels is \ndecreased in this model of essential hypertension.\n502.

Instituto de Medicina Traslacional, Trasplante y Bioinge -\nnier\u00eda, IMETTYB-CONICET, Universidad Favaloro, Ciudad \nAut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, Argentina\nIt has been described that one of the triggers of a wide spectrum of \nventricular arrhythmias is the abnormal intracellular Ca2+ handling \nduring the excitation-co-contraction coupling (ECC) in the cardio -\nmyocyte. One of the possible abnormalities is the alteration of the \nrecovery of refractoriness between heartbeats, known as Ca2+ re-\nlease restitution (CRR). Although the control of CRR has been asso -\nciated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ loading and ryan -\nodine receptor (RyR2) Ca2+ sensitivity, an intriguing point is whether \nthe restitution of the action potential (AP) and/or the L-type calcium \ncurrent (ICa) are involved in the determination of CRR. To assess \nthese interrogates, we used mouse isolated cardiac myocytes with \nhigher CRR velocities respect to control myocytes (WT, 2mM exter -\nnal Ca2+ concentration), obtained by increasing SR Ca2+ load by us -\ning two different maneuvers, 1. ablation of phospholamban (PLNKO \nmyocytes) and  2. Increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentration (WT \nmyocytes, 4mM external Ca2+ concentration). Restitution of cytosolic \nCa2+ transient (Fura-2 AM), L-type Ca2+ current (ICa, patch-clamp) \nand action potential (AP, microelectrodes) were evaluated with a \ntwo-pulse protocol (S1/S2). CRR, ICa and AP restitution percent -\nages increased as a function of the coupling interval (S2-S1), fol -\nlowing an exponential curve. CRR was accelerated in PLNKO vs. \nWT myocytes and in WT myocytes at 4 vs. 2 mM Ca. In both cases \nthere was a greater ICa Ca2+-dependent inactivation induced by the \nenhanced RyR2 release of Ca2+. However, whereas ICa and AP res -\ntitution did not differ between PLNKO vs. WT myocytes, they were \nslightly but significantly accelerated in WT myocytes at 4 vs. 2 mM \nCa2+. Similar results were obtained with a mathematical model of \nhuman myocyte. We conclude that an acceleration of ICa restitution \nrecovery may influence but is not a requisite for the occurrence of \na faster CRR.\n505.

We studied how HlyA affects \nvolume regulation in RBCs.\nRBCs were treated with 0.1 ng/\u00b5l HlyA or vehicle at 37 \u00b0C for 1, 5 and \n10 min. Cell volume (Vt) was measured using the Coulter Counter \nprinciple. Rapid kinetics of Vt was assessed by light scattering using \na stopped flow rapid mixing equipment. Cells were preexposed 1, 5 \nand 10 min to HlyA, and Vt changes were measured over 4 s after \n140 mosM osmotic gradient. Exponential curves were fitted to data. \nBest fit values of the exponential coefficient (k) were obtained, which \nestimates osmotic water permeability (Pf). Intracellular contents of \nNa+ and K+ were measured by flame photometry.\nHlyA-treated RBCs underwent a slight shrinkage, followed by con -\ntinuous swelling up to 12% over control values after 10 min. Vt \nchanges were accompanied by parallel intracellular [Na+] increase \nand [K+] decrease.\nExposure to HlyA decreased k values from 7.6 \u00b1 0.1 seg-1 to 3.4 \u00b1 \n0.2 seg-1 after 10 min. In hyposmotic media (190-280 mosM), Vt \nincreased over 10 min. Preexposure to these media showed that \nk values decreased as Vt increased, so that a 54% reduction of k \nvalues was obtained when Vt was increased by 30%.\nIn the presence of HlyA and suramin (blocker of purinergic recep -\ntors), Vt did not change, but k values were reduced by 30%. \nComparing HlyA and hyposmotic media, the reduction of k values \nmay be partly assigned to cell swelling. However, results using sur -\namin+HlyA, where changes in Vt and k were uncoupled, show that \nanother factor is affecting k, and therefore Pf of RBCs.\nParadoxically, HlyA causes RBC swelling, which ultimately leads to \nlysis, while simultaneously reduces water permeability.\nThis work was supported by Grants PIP 112 201501 00459, CON -\nICET; 200201701001 52BA, UBACyT; PICT 2016-1041, ANPCyT; \nECOS sud-MINCyT A15S01 and Laboratory of Excellence GR-Ex \nANR-11-LABX-0051.\n506. (192) ROLE OF AQUAPORIN-2 AND TRPV4 IN RENAL \nCELL MIGRATION\nCutrera N, Rivera MF, Beltramone N, Rivarola V, Ford P, Ca -\npurro C, Di Giusto G.\nLaboratorio de Biomembranas, IFIBIO-HOUSSAY (UBA-CO -\nNICET), Facultad de Medicina, UBA.\nWe have previously shown that Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) promotes re -\nnal cell migration. This promigratory effect is due, at least in part, \nto the modulation of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1) activity, responsible \nfor lamellipodia alkalinization, which would generate the appropri -\nate microenvironment for actin and focal adhesion dynamics. Taking \ninto account that we have demonstrated a physical and functional \ninteraction between AQP2 and Ca2+ channel TRPV4, and that NHE1 \nactivity is modulated by Ca2+, we propose to investigate the contribu -\ntion of TRPV4 in the AQP2-dependent renal cell migration. We used \ntwo renal cell models: one WT not expressing AQPs and another \none expressing AQP2. First, we determined TRPV4 expression \nin lamellipodia of migrating cells by immunofluorescence assays. \nThen, we evaluated TRPV4 participation in collective cell migration \nthrough wound healing assays in presence of a specific activator \n(GSK1016790A, 3nM). Finally, we characterize focal adhesion \ncomplexes by revealing the mechanosensor Vinculin. Our results \nshowed that TRPV4 is present in lamellipodia of both cell types, \nbut AQP2-expressing cells have a higher intensity ratio per area \nanalyzed (WT: 794\u00b184, n=32; AQP2: 1371\u00b179, n=74; ***p<0,001). In AQP2-expressing cells, the activation of TRPV4 produces a de -\ncrease in migration indicating that, probably, TRPV4 is already in \nan activated state and overactivation results in a harmful excess \nof Ca2+ (Control: 29.65\u00b11.25%, n=10; GSK: 19.14\u00b11.18%, n=6; \n***p<0,001). Moreover, lamellipodia of AQP2-expressing cells have \nfocal adhesions of small size evidencing the rapid turnover of ac -\ntive migrating cells (WT: 6.68\u00b10.78\u00b5m2, n=29; AQP2: 2.50\u00b10.23\u00b5m2, \nn=10; *p<0,05). These results let us to propose that during lamelli -\npodia protrusion the presence of AQP2 activates it\u2019s partner TRPV4, \nleading to a regulated Ca2+ entry. Furthermore, we propose that Ca2+ \nentering in the vicinity of focal adhesions would favor the assembly/\ndisassembly cycles of these adhesive sites.\n507.

MTs also are highly charged polyelectrolytes. Recent \nin vitro  electrophysiological studies indicate that different brain MT \nstructures, including two-dimensional (2D) sheets (MT sheets) and \nbundles, generate highly synchronous electrical oscillations (Can -\ntero et al. Sci Rep, 2016 & 2018). Although taxol-stabilized isolated \nMTs are capable of amplifying electrical signals, no information is \nheretofore available as to whether isolated MTs also engage in elec -\ntrical oscillations. Herein we tested the effect of voltage clamping on \nthe electrical properties of non-taxol stabilized isolated brain MTs. \nElectrical oscillations were observed at holding potentials between \n\u00b1200 mV. Mean oscillatory currents were linear with respect to hold -\ning potential, with a change in conductance from 59.6 \u00b1 3.6 nS to \n160.8 \u00b1 7.6 nS (n = 3) after loose-patch correction. This average \nchange in conductance was much higher than previously reported \nfor more complex MT structures. The frequency domain spectral \nanalysis also disclosed a richer oscillatory response as compared to \nthat observed in voltage clamped MT sheets from the same prepa -\nration. This interesting finding is consistent with the possibility that \nmore structured MT complexes (i.e. bundles, sheets) may render \nmore coherent responses at given oscillatory frequencies and raise \nthe hypothesis that combined MTs may tend to entrain and oscillate \ntogether. The electrical oscillatory behavior of isolated brain MTs is \nconsistent with that of \u201cionic-based\u201d transistors whose activity is syn -\nchronized in higher MT structures. The ability of MTs to generate, \npropagate, and amplify electrical signals may have important impli -\ncations in neuronal computational capabilities.\n508.

Methods:  Hypothyroid -\nism was induced in Balb/c mice by treatment with propylthiouracil \n(PTU; 0.5 g/l drinking water for 15 days) or thyroidectomy. Thyroid \nhormone levels were quantified by RIA. ROS were evaluated by \nDCFH-DA staining and flow cytometry.

Apoptosis \nof lymphoid cells was quantified by flow cytometry and cell prolifera -\ntion was evaluated by incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into DNA. Re-\nsults:  We found that both, hypothyroid mice by treatment with PTU \nand thyroidectomized (Thy) had an increased production of ROS \nin lymph nodes (LN) and spleen (S) compared to euthyroid mice \n[% increase (LN) PTU: 68.5\u00b18.4, Thy: 62.2\u00b16.5 and % increase (S) \nPTU: 50.3\u00b15.8, Thy: 62.6\u00b17.3 (p<0.05; n=9)]. We did not observe \nliver tissue damage in the mice treated with PTU. Hypothyroid mice \nhad smaller lymphatic organs, a lower density of lymphoid follicles/\nfield and a decreased proliferative capacity against mitogenic stimuli \ncompared to euthyroid controls. Apoptosis in hypothyroid mice was \nsimilar to controls. Conclusions : Hypothyroidism induced by PTU \nor thyroidectomy increases ROS production in lymphoid tissue and \nhas negative effects on lymphocyte functionality.

ROS could act as \na signaling molecule involved in cell functionality or exert cytotox -\nic actions depending on its intracellular concentration. The harmful \neffects of ROS are counteracted by the cellular antioxidant system. \nObjective: To study the effects of oxidative stress on lymphocyte \nfunctionality in hyperthyroid mice, analyzing the role of antioxidant \nenzymes in the scavenging of ROS.  Methods:  Balb/c mice were \ntreated with placebo (euthyroid) or T4 ( 12 mg/l drinking water for \n30 days-hyperthyroid). ROS were evaluated by DCFH-DA staining \nand flow cytometry. The expression of catalase (CAT), glutathione \nperoxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was deter -\nmined by qPCR and WB. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V-PI, \nRhodamine-123 or Hoechst-33342 staining followed by flow cytom -\netry or fluorescence microscopy. The number of follicles in lymphoid \ntissue sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin was determined by \nmicroscopy. Cell size and granularity was evaluated by flow cy -\ntometry. Proliferation was evaluated by incorporation of [3H]-thymi -\ndine. Results:  We found an increased production of ROS in the \nlymph nodes (LN) and spleen (S) of hyperthyroid mice (% increase \nLN:60.6\u00b15.1; S:63.5\u00b15.9, p<0.05) that was correlated with an in -\ncreased genomic and protein expression of CAT and GPx (CATRNAm% \nLN:85.1\u00b16.2, S:147.2\u00b19.7; CATprotein% LN:154.3\u00b19.7, S:65.7\u00b15.8; \nGPxRNAm% LN:43.7\u00b13.1, S:39.8\u00b14.7; GPxprotein% LN:47.6\u00b15.1, \nS:71.1\u00b16.6; p<0.05). We did not find significant differences in the \nexpression of SOD. Apoptosis was similar in both groups. Hyper -\nthyroid mice had hypertrophied lymphatic organs, more lymphoid \nfollicles and lymphoid cells in active cell proliferation. Conclusions : \nAntioxidant enzymes partially decrease ROS, avoiding their cyto -\ntoxic effect on lymphoid cells. ROS could participate in the signaling \npathways involved in lymphocyte functionality.\n510.

A similar impact of TSH con contractility was \nobserved in cardiomyocytes derived from human IPS cells. These \neffects were abolished by the PKA inhibitor H89, suggesting that the \nTSH receptor through its Gsa/PKA singling underlies the contractile \neffect of TSH in adult cardiac myocytes. Cardiomyocytes incubated \nwith TSH showed profound alterations in the expression of Ca2+ \nproteins SERCA, RyR2 and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NXC) which \nwere reverted by H89. Importantly, TSH fails to further reduce con -\ntractility in myocytes isolated from a rat model of Hypo with elevated \nTSH.  We conclude that TSH has direct negative effects on cardi -\nac mechanical activity by altering the expression of Ca2+ handling \nproteins by a PKA-dependent-signaling pathway. We speculate that \nelevated TSH contributes to contractile dysfunction associated with \nHypo.\n512.

LIS maturation is characterized \nby the local reorganization of actin filaments and NK receptors, and \ncentrosome (Ct) and Golgi apparatus (GA) translocation towards \nthis site. AKAP350 is an A-kinase anchoring protein that partici -\npates in MT nucleation at the Ct and at the GA. Our previous results \nshowed that AKAP350 participates in NK cytotoxic activity. The aim \nof this work was to characterize MT nucleation during NK activation \nand to evaluate MT\u00b4 role in the initial events of LIS maturation. In or -\nder to characterize MT nucleation, YTS cells were activated through \nLFA-1 and CD28 receptors for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C and then subject -\ned to an ice-recovery assay for detection of newly nucleated micro -\ntubules. Confocal microscopy analysis of a-tubulin and GM130 (a \nGA marker) showed that not only the Ct (commonly regarded as the \nexclusive microtubule organizing center, MTOC, in lymphocytes) but \nalso the GA were responsible for MT nucleation. Our results further \nshowed that MT nucleation at the GA was diminished in AKAP350 \nknockdown cells (-50%*). Previous works indicated that NK cyto -\ntoxicity is reduced by Nocodazole (Noc) or Taxol (Tx) treatment. \nYTS cells were subjected to Noc or Tx treatment and incubated with \nKT86 target cells at 37\u00b0 for 30 minutes. Confocal microscopy analy -\nsis of LFA-1 staining of those cells showed that LFA-1 organization \nwas inhibited both by disruption of MT filaments (Noc: -42%*) and by \nMT stabilization (Tx: -40%*). On the other hand, actin organization \nat the LIS was exclusively impaired by Noc treatment (-30%*). Over -\nall, our studies characterize for the first time the GA participation as \na MTOC in NK cells and demonstrate the relevance of MT dynamics \nfor LFA-1 clustering at NK LIS.

Homeostatic control of intestinal oxidative environment \nis crucial in nutrient digestion and absorption, and barrier function. \nIntestinal Mrp2 is an ABC transporter that limits the absorption of \nxenobiotics orally ingested, thus acting as a biochemical barrier. We \nhere evaluated the short-term effect of OS on intestinal Mrp2 sub -\ncellular localization and its barrier function by treatment of isolated \nintestinal sacs with 250 \u00b5M of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH 250) for \n30 min (N=6). We first confirmed that TBH 250 generated OS in in -\ntestinal tissue as indicated by increasing lipid peroxidation products \n(+61%) and catalase (+44%) and glutathione peroxidase (+28%) ac -\ntivities, and by decreasing GSH content (-19%), the GSH/ GSSG ra -\ntio (-29%) and superoxide dismutase activity (-21%), respect to con -\ntrols (C, p<0.05). Assessment of Mrp2 distribution between brush \nborder (BBM) and intracellular (IM) membrane fractions by western blotting, showed that Mrp2 protein decreased in BBM (-44%) and \nincreased in IM (+75%) after treatment with TBH 250 compared to C \n(p<0.05), consistent with an internalization process. In line with this, \nefflux of the Mrp2 substrate dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione in everted \nintestinal sacs decreased in TBH group (-35%, p<0.05), indicating \nthat Mrp2 internalization is of functional significance. Also, treatment \nwith G\u00f66976, a selective inhibitor of cPKC isoforms, was able to \ncompletely block the decrease in Mrp2 protein expression in BBM \n(-45%, p<0.05) and its increase in IM content (+74%, p<0.05), as \nwell as the impairment in Mrp2 activity (-35%, p<0.05) induced by \nTBH. In conclusion, we demonstrated a posttranslational regulation \nof rat intestinal Mrp2 by short-term exposition to OS. This process \nconsisted of a rapid Mrp2 internalization to IM, likely mediated by \ncPKC, with impairment of its barrier function.\n514.

Aim: To evaluate the hepatoprotective \nrole of GNT in a model of acute intoxication with PQ in rats. Meth -\nods: Treatment I: Control (vehicles), GNT (5 mg/kg/day sc, 4 days), \nPQ (50 mg/kg ip, last day) and GNT+PQ. Hepatic malondialdehyde \n(MDA) levels were measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive sub -\nstances methodology. Levels of 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts \n(4-HNEp-add) and glutathione-S-transferase alpha (GST\u03b1) protein \nexpression were evaluated in liver by Western blotting. Treatment \nII: Control (vehicle), GNT (5 mg/kg/day sc, 3 days). Biliary excre -\ntion of PQ was studied in two models: in vivo  excretion and isolated \nperfused liver (IPL). PQ (50 mg/kg iv) was administered at day 4, \nbefore bile sampling. Bile was collected each 10 min, during a 40 \nmin-period. PQ was quantified by HPLC. Results (*p<0.05 vs all \nother groups; #p<0.05 vs C and PQ): PQ significantly increased he -\npatic MDA and 4-HNEp-add levels, whereby pretreatment with GNT \nameliorated this effect  [MDA (pmol/g protein, n=3): C: 55\u00b12; GNT: \n55\u00b17; PQ: 76\u00b13*; GNT+PQ: 64\u00b14. 4-HNEp-add (% of C, n=4-6): C: \n100\u00b133; GNT: 172\u00b148; PQ: 258\u00b171*; GNT+PQ: 126\u00b133]. PQ biliary \nexcretion remained unchanged after treatments  in both experimen -\ntal models.  Hepatic GST\u03b1 protein expression was augmented in \nGNT-treated rats, while PQ did not modify the hepatic GST\u03b1 levels \n(% of C, n=3): C: 100\u00b133; GNT: 359\u00b186#; PQ: 73\u00b140; GNT+PQ: \n425\u00b198#. This result agrees with the lower content of 4-HNE ad -\nducts in the GNT+PQ group respect to PQ group. Unexpectedly, \nthe increased activity of P-gp induced by GNT did not enhance PQ \nbiliary excretion. Thus, GNT protective mechanism is likely through \nthe induction of GST\u03b1 which rapidly metabolizes 4-HNE before for -\nmation of protein adducts.\n515.

We previously found that in \nhepatocytes, mitochondrial aquaporin-8 (AQP8) channels facilitate \nammonia diffusion and its metabolism into urea. In this study, we \ninvestigated whether the gene transfer of human AQP8 (hAQP8) MEDICINA - Volumen 80 - (Supl. V), 2020200\nto hepatocyte mitochondria is able to recover the impaired ammo -\nnia-derived ureagenesis in hepatocytes treated with the model hep -\natotoxin thiocetamide (TAA). Primary cultured rat hepatocytes were \ntreated with TAA (0-30 mM) for 24 h. We previously reported that the \nurea synthesis from ammonia is significantly inhibited by TAA at 20 \nand 30 mM concentrations without affecting cell viability. Hepato -\ncytes were transduced with the  recombinant adenoviral vector en -\ncoding hAQP8, AdhAQP8, or a control adenovector.  Mitochondrial \nsubfractionation followed by immunoblotting confirmed that hAQP8 \nwas rightly expressed at mitochondrial level, and that its expression \nwas unaffected by TAA. M itochondrially-expressed hAQP8  was able \nto significantly restore ureagenesis from TAA-treated hepatocytes \n(Control: 100\u00b1 17%; TAA-20mM: 49 \u00b1 19%*; TAA-20mM+hAQP8: \n94 \u00b1 15%; TAA-30mM: 25 \u00b1 7%*; TAA-30mM + hAQP8: 114 \u00b1 20%; \ndata are means \u00b1 SEM; n=6; * P<0.05 from control). Nuclear mag -\nnetic resonance studies using 15N-labeled ammonia confirmed that \nhepatocyte 15N-labeled urea synthesis was reduced by TAA and fully \nrestored by hAQP8 transduction (Control: 100 \u00b1 13%; TAA-30mM: \n26 \u00b1 16%*; TAA-30mM + hAQP8: 168 \u00b1 16%*; data are means \u00b1 \nSEM; n=3; * P<0.05 from control). In conclusion, our data indicate \nthat the mitochondrial expression of hAQP8 improves ammonia con -\nversion to urea in TAA-treated hepatocytes thus providing further \nsupport for a key role of AQP8 in hepatic ammonia metabolism. This \nknowledge might contribute to the understanding and treatment of \ncertain hyperammonemic conditions .\n516.

Facultad de Ciencias Bioqu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas, Uni -\nversidad Nacional de Rosario (UNR), Rosario, Santa Fe, Ar -\ngentina.\nHepatocyte mitochondrial aquaporin-8 (mtAQP8) is a multifunction -\nal channel protein able to facilitate the  diffusional release of H2O2.\nWe recently provided evidence suggesting that mtAQP8, via a H2O2 \nsignaling, plays a role in the modulation of hepatocyte cholestero -\ngenesis. To expand that study, we cultured human hepatocyte-de -\nrived Huh-7 cells in medium with lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) \nto reduce sterol content which in turn induces the de novo synthe -\nsis of cholesterol and fatty acids, and assessed the involvement \nof mtAQP8 by gene silencing. Lipid synthesis was determined by \nfollowing the incorporation of radiolabeled acetate. AQP8 silencing \nwas performed by using two different siRNAs and corresponding \nscrambled control siRNA. Protein expression was assessed by \nimmunoblotting. Cell culturing in LPDS medium induced mtAQP8 \nexpression by 80% (P < 0.05) as well as the de novo  synthesis of \ncholesterol and fatty acids by around 100 % (P < 0.05) . Accordingly, \nexpression of the key enzymes for cholesterol and fatty acid syn -\nthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCoAR) and \nfatty acid synthase (FAS), was also significantly increased by 300 \nand 60% ( P < 0.05) , respectively. AQP8 silencing (-50% protein ex -\npression) down-regulated the LPDS-induced synthesis of cholester -\nol and fatty acids by around 30% ( P < 0.05) . HMGCoAR and FAS \nexpressions were also down-regulated by around 50% ( P < 0.05). \nIn conclusion, our data suggest that human hepatocytes cultured \nin LPDS media up-regulates mtAQP8 expression and that mtAQP8 \ngene silencing down-regulates the LPDS-induced de novo  choles -\nterol and fatty acids synthesis by decreasing expression of the key \nlipogenic enzymes HMGCoAR and FAS. These data further support \na regulatory role of mtAQP8 in hepatocyte lipid homeostasis.\n517.

Prolactin (PRL) plasma levels are greatly \nincreased in lactating females and the classic PRL way of action \nimplies interaction with its receptor and activation of Stat5 transcrip -\ntion factor. Previously, we have reported that the activity and protein \nexpression of hepatic Pgp were up-regulated in 15 days postpartum \n(PP) rats, and the same effect was observed in rats after exogen \nPRL treatment. Aim: To elucidate the mechanism involved in the \nmodulation of hepatic Pgp expression by PRL. Methods: Mdr1a and \nMdr1b  mRNA levels were quantified by qRT-PCR in 1- livers of lac -\ntating rats at 15 days PP vs virgin females (VF), 2- primary cultured \nhepatocytes isolated from female rats. Cells were incubated for 4, 6 \nand 12 h with 0.1 \u00b5g/mL PRL (concentration mimicking plasma lev -\nels in PP rats) or vehicle. Also, hepatocytes were pre-treated with 5 \n\u00b5g/mL actinomycin D (ActD, RNA polymerase II inhibitor) or vehicle \nfor 30 min, before PRL treatment (0.1 \u00b5g/mL) for 12 h or vehicle. \nResults (% of control, p<0.05): 1- In vivo  we observed that Mdr1b  \nmRNA levels were significantly up-regulated (+240%, n=5-6) in PP \ngroup. 2- In line with this, in isolated hepatocytes treated whit PRL, \nboth Mdr1a  (+110%) and Mdr1b  (+80%) mRNA abundance was sig -\nnificantly increased at 12 h, without changes at 4 and 6 h (n=3-5), \nwhile PRL effect on Mdr1a  and Mdr1b  mRNA levels was completely \nabolished by ActD (n=3-5). Conclusion: These findings demonstrat -\ned a transcriptional mechanism by which PRL up-regulates hepatic \nPgp expression. This effect could be mediated by Stat5 since the \nbiological functions of PRL are mainly derived by its activation. In -\ncreased hepatic Pgp expression and activity suggest altered biliary \nexcretion of its substrates with potential consequences on their ef -\nficacy or toxicity.\n518.

HlyA irreversibly binds to human erythrocytes \n(RBCs), initiating a degenerative process called eryptosis, charac -\nterized by biochemical and morphological changes such as phos -\nphatidylserine (PS) exposure to the external layer of the plasma \nmembrane of RBCs, shrinkage, and swelling. HlyA-induced PS ex -\nternalization can lead to adhesion of RBCs to vascular endothelial \ncells (VECs).\nWe studied the capacity of HlyA-treated RBCs to adhere to: 1- acti -\nvated endothelial HMEC-1 cells under different flow conditions (dy -\nnamic adhesion); 2- surfaces homogeneously covered with extracel -\nlular matrix components in static conditions.\nResults showed that HlyA induced adhesion of RBCs to VECs at low \nflow (0.2 dyn/cm2), although higher flows induced rapid detachment. \nOn the other hand, HlyA treatment also induced static adhesion of \nRBCs to collagen or fibrinogen. Thus, HlyA-treated RBCs displayed \nhigh but weak adherence to VECs under the experimental condi -\ntions.\nAdditionally, to study the molecular mechanism of the HlyA-induced \nadhesion of RBCs we designed a biomimetic device to emulate the \nconditions of the blood vessels.\nThe device was built by coupling a microfluidic chip to a nanopat -\nterned surface (NPS) coated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Dif -\nferent adhesion molecules from the VECs could be anchored to the \nAuNPs to mimic exposure of adhesion molecules of an activated en -\ndothelium whereas, the architecture of the capillaries was emulated \nby a network of microfluidic channels built in polydimethylsiloxane \n(PDMS). The synthesis of the device was optimized by following \nthe process with quartz microbalance and fluorescence microscopy. \nFuture experiments using the device will allow investigating HlyA-in -\nduced adhesion of RBCs to specific adhesion molecules under flow \nconditions.\nINFECTOLOG\u00cdA Y PARASITOLOG\u00cdA\n520.

To simulate \nan ascending infection, explants were incubated in the chorion-side \nwith 5nM/50nM HlyA during 24h. HlyA was detected by immuno -\nhistochemistry and histological signs of damage (like edema, vac -\nuolization, early/late apoptosis, extracellular matrix thickness, and \nnumber of fibroblast) were evaluated from paraffin-embedded tis -\nsue sections stained with hematoxylin/eosin. Necrosis was tested \nby LDH release and the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) \nwas measured using a Millicell-ERS unit (n=3). Groups were com -\npared using t-, U Mann-Whitney or Chi-squared test as correspond.\nResults:  HlyA interaction with chorioamniotic membranes caused \nstructural alterations and a slight diminish of TEER after 24hs of in -\ncubation. The main tissue alterations were observed for the highest \ntoxin concentration tested (50nM HlyA). Epithelial layer remained \npractically unaltered, while chorion cells showed an increment of \nvacuolization and necrosis. Extracellular matrix thickness was high -\ner and fibroblast number lower in treated groups compared to con -\ntrol ones. \nConclusion: HlyA by itself is capable to introduce structural modi -\nfications in human chorioamniotic membranes, suggesting a role of \nthis toxin in premature rupture of membranes.\nMEDICINA REGENERATIVA Y TERAPIA CELULAR\n521.

Rad Bio S.A.S\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common \nchronic liver disorder in developed countries, affecting up to 20% \nof the global population. Treatments for NAFLD patients are limited. \nThus, the development of treatments to improve NAFLD patient \u2019s \nhealth, is of clinical relevance. TGF- \u03b2 pathway is related to hepat -\nic steatosis and fibrogenesis in NAFLD. We have described a new \nsoluble variant of TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor, called TGFBR2-SE, that \nwas fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (TGFBR2-SE/Fc), lead -\ning to the development of Brecept (Br). The aim of this work was \nto study, in a high fat high sucrose diet (HFHSD)-induced NAFLD \nrat model, the effect of lentiviral-mediated liver overexpression of \nBr (Lv-Br). We compared three experimental groups: Control, HF -\nHSD, and HFHSD+Br that received an intrahepatic injection of Lv-Br \nat week 17. Before Lv-Br injection, we observed insulin resistance \nin the HFHSD group (p<0,05) by Glucose Tolerance Test. At week \n21, animals were sacrificed. Liver rats from the HFHSD+Br group \nshowed a coloration and consistence similar to the Control group. \nAlso, we found a slight tendency of liver weight improvement in \nthe HFHSD+Br group (Control vs HFHSD p<0,05; Control vs HF -\nHSD+Br, and HFHSD vs HFHSD-Br non-significant differences). In \nliver sections stained with H&E, Masson \u2019s trichome and Reticulin we \nobserved that administration of Lv-Br, compared with the HFHSD \ngroup, significantly decreased microvesicular steatosis, improved \nhepatocyte cord \u2019s organization and hepatocellular ballooning close \nto central veins . In addition, we also observed a slight decrease in \nmicrovesicular steatosis near portal triads (PT). Moreover, Lv-Br \ndecreased type III collagen deposition in perisinusoidal/pericellular \nspace, type I collagen deposition in periportal/portal zones and the \nsize of inflammatory foci in PT.

The aim of this study \nwas to evaluate the effect of antioxidants supplements (AS) and iron \noverload (FeO) on hepatic and cardiometabolic parameters.\nMaterial and Methods: Male rats were exposed for 12 weeks to a \nstandard diet (SD) or HFFD with or without AS or FeO (each sub -\ngroup n= 8-10). AS was composed of selenium, zinc, vitamins E, \nC and \u03b1-lipoic acid. Body weight (BW) and systolic blood pressure \n(SBP) were measured every 4 w. Metabolic variables (blood glu -\ncose, triglyceridemia -Try-, cholesterolemia -Cho-, serum HDLc, \nuricemia) were assayed at the end of the experiment, and thiobar -\nbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in plasma were estimat -\ned. After euthanasia, abdominal white adipose tissue (AWAT) and \nliver were extracted and weights expressed as a percentage of BW. \nTBARS and triglycerides were evaluated in liver homogenates. Data \nwere analyzed by two-way ANOVA tests adjusted by Bonferroni cor -\nrection. Results: SBP increased at 4 w in HFFD, SD-Fe (p<0.05), \nand in 8-12 weeks in HFFD, SD-Fe, HFFD-Fe vs controls groups \n(p<0.001). AS decreased SBP in HFFD, HFFD-Fe (p<0.02) rats \nand also BW in HFFD (p<0.01). BW and AWAT were decreased in \nHFFD-Fe (p<0.01) groups. Try increased in HFFD (p<0.05);  HFFD-\nAS (p<0.01) and in HFFD-Fe vs controls rats (p<0.05). Cho was \nlower in SD-Fe, HFFD-Fe (p<0.01) and HDLc in HFFD-AS (p<0.01), \nSD-Fe (p<0.01) and HFFD-Fe (p<0.01) groups. TBARS in plasma \nand liver and triglycerides in liver increased in HFFD rats (p<0.01), \nwhile AS decreased TBARS (p<0.01) -data only available in these \ngroups-. Conclusions: This study show some evidence that AS in -\ntake counteracts SBP increase in HFFD and HFFD-Fe groups while \nFeO increase SBP in SD and HFFD rats. AS may also have a role \nin counteracting HDLc and TBARS increase probably through the \nscavenging property of O2- accumulation. At last FeO diminished \nCho and HDLc in SD and HFFD rats\n523.

Our results indicated that ma -\nternal voluntary ingestion of hypertonic NaCl solution during preg -\nnancy and lactation until one-week post-weaning affect the sodium \nand water intake and the brain angiotensinergic type 1a receptor \n(AT1a) and vasopressin (AVP) mRNA expression induced by osmot -\nic challenges. In order to analyze possible renal alterations, we stud -\nied the effect of this perinatal hypertonic sodium exposure on adult \noffspring kidney mRNA expression of AT1a, AVP type V2 (AVP2) \nand the TRPV1 channel, during basal condition and after an osmotic \nchallenge. \nWe studied Wistar Rats, with a perinatal manipulation (M) that cov -\nered dams from 1 week before conception until the 28 postnatal \nday of the offspring. The experimental groups were: -M-NaCl: Free \naccess to 0.45M NaCl solution, food and water; and -M-Ctrol: Free \naccess to food and water. We analyzed the kidney weigh and mRNA \nexpression of adult offspring in basal and after 2M NaCl infusion \nchallenge conditions. \nWe did not find any significant difference in the kidney weights be -\ntween the groups. However, the M-NaCl group present a significant increase in the At1a expression in relation to M-Ctrol (F= 8.09; \np=0.017, program effect). By the other hand, we found that 2M NaCl \ninfused animals, present a significant decrease (F=6.31; p=0.026) \nof the TRPV1 mRNA expression (postnatal treatment effect). Finally, \nthe AVP2 receptor gene expression did not show a significant differ -\nence but had a tendency to increase in M-NaCl animals (p=0.08). \nTogether these and our previous results indicate that the availability \nof a rich source of NaCl during the perinatal period induces long-\nterm changes at brain and renal angiotensinergic and vasopress -\ninergic systems modulating the behavioral, endocrine and renal \nresponse to achieve the hydroelectrolyte homeostasis.\n524.

Departments of Nutrition and Environmental Toxicology, \nUniversity of California, Davis, USA.\nIrisin is an exercise-induced myokine that can induce browning of \nwhite adipose tissue (WAT) and other metabolic benefits. We pre -\nviously observed that supplementation with the flavonoid quercetin \n(Q) mitigated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced glucose intolerance and \nadipose hypertrophy. In this study, we investigated whether these \nbeneficial effects could be related to Q capacity to activate muscle \nFNDC5/irisin and uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) and others brown \nmarkers in the WAT of HFD fed rats. Also, the role of Q on FNDC5/\nirisin was further investigated in vitro in L6 myotubes triggered with \npalmitate. Co-administration of Q (20 mg/kg body weight/d) to the \nHFD during 6 weeks significantly increased FNDC5/irisin pathway \nand p-AMPK and p-p38 in skeletal muscle compared to the control \nand HFD groups. In addition, Q significantly upregulated proteins \ninvolved in WAT browning (PRDM16, PGC1-\u03b1, PPAR \u0263 and UCP-1) \ncompared with control and HFD groups. Moreover, in the HFD+Q \ngroup we observed a partial and significant BAT weight increase \ncompared to the HFD and Ctrl groups, respectively. In L6 myotubes \nQ prevented palmitate-decrease GLUT4, PGC1-\u03b1 and irisin secre -\ntion. Q 1 \u00b5M also prevented palmitate-downregulated mRNA levels \nof PGC 1\u03b1 and FNDC 5. In addition, PGC-1\u03b1 siRNA transfection in \nL6 myotubes abrogated the effects of Q on FNDC5 protein expres -\nsion. These data suggest that Q activated FNDC5/irisin pathway, in \npart via PGC-1\u03b1 activation. Overall, Q supplementation enhanced \nFNDC5/irisin pathway in L6 myotubes and muscle, activated AMPK, \np38 MAPK and GLUT4 in muscle and induced adipose tissue \nbrowning in the WAT of rats fed a HFD. These findings support the \npotential relevance of consuming Q-rich foods or supplements to \nattenuate high fat diet-induced metabolic alterations.\n525.

CIUNR \nTubular remodeling in response to acute kidney injury (AKI) involves \nthe dedifferentiation and regeneration of the remaining epithelial tu -\nbular cells.  Microtubules (MT) dynamic instability plays a central \nrole in renal repair after AKI. Angiotensin II (AGII) has two main re -\nceptors, AT1R and AT2R, which mediate dissimilar effects. During \nischemia reperfusion (IR), AT1R mediates a pro-fibrotic response, \nwhereas AT2R facilitates the recovery of the kidney function (our \nunpublished data). The aim of this work was to investigate AT1R \nand AT2R participation in the regulation of factors associated with \nMT dynamic instability that could affect the epithelial tubular cell-re -\nsponse to an AKI. MDCK cells were grown in conditions that assure \na well-defined epithelial polarity and treated with 0.5 \u00b5M AGII (AGII), \nAGII plus the AT1R antagonist losartan (5 \u00b5M) (AGII + los), or 1 \n\u00b5M C21, AT2R agonist (C21). EB1 is a central regulator of MT dy -\nnamic instability that participates in tubulogenesis. AGII induced an \nincrease in EB1 levels which was mimicked by C21 (+50%*, n=3) \nand was not prevented by Los. \u03b1-tubulin acetylation is linked to the \npresence of stable MT. Our preliminary data showed that activation \nof AT2R, but not AT1R, decreased the fraction of acetylated \u03b1-tubu -\nlin (Control (C): 0.55 \u00b1 0.05; AGII: 0.25 \u00b1 0.05; AGII + Los: 0.06 \u00b1 \n0.03; C21: 0.14 \u00b1 0.03, n=2). Primary cilia are organelles of tubular \ncells that are down-regulated during AKI-tubular remodeling, whose \nlength directly correlates with the levels of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin. \nAnalysis of the primary cilia showed that through AT1R AGII increas -\nes whereas through AT2R it decreases the cilia length (in \u00b5m: C: 2.8 \n\u00b1 0.1; AGII: 3.1 \u00b1 0.1; AGII + Los: 2.4 \u00b1 0.1 *; C21: 2.3 \u00b1 0.1 *, n>80). \nOverall, our results indicate that AGII increases MT dynamic instabil -\nity through AT2R, which would favor tubular remodeling. Our future studies will evaluate the relevance of these effects in the response \nto IR induced AKI. * p<0.05 vs C.\n527.

CONICET.\nNa-K-Cl cotransporter 2 (NKCC2) and Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) are pro -\nteins localized in the apical membrane of the renal thick ascending \nlimb of Henle\u2019s loop (TAL) and the collecting duct (CD), respectively. \nNKCC2 performs active transport of NaCl in the TAL, which con -\ntributes to create the corticomedullary concentration gradient. The \ninterstitial hypertonicity achieved in the renal medulla leads to wa -\nter absorption through the AQP2 water channel in the CD. In acute \nobstructive cholestasis (OC), increases in urinary flow and in the \nfractional excretion of osmolytes were observed. In order to evaluate \nthe roles of NKCC2 and AQP2 in the modifications of renal han -\ndling of water and osmolytes detected, renal expression of NKCC2 \nand AQP2 was evaluated in rats with OC. Bile duct ligation of 21 \nh (BDL, n=4) was performed in Wistar rats. Sham-operated rats \nserved as controls (S, n=4). Apical membranes were isolated from \nrenal cortical (CAM) and medullary (MAM) tissue. The expression of \nNKCC2 and AQP2 was evaluated by immunoblotting and immuno -\nhistochemistry. %NKCC2: CAM: S=100\u00b18 BDL=71\u00b18*; MAM: S=100\u00b14 \nBDL=91\u00b14. %AQP2: CAM: S=100\u00b110 BDL=98\u00b113; MAM: S=100\u00b13 \nBDL=81\u00b14* (*p<0.05). The immunohistochemistry confirmed the \ndata obtained by immunoblotting. In BDL rats, NKCC2 protein ex -\npression remained unchanged in MAM, while it decreased in CAM. \nAQP2 protein expression decreased in MAM of BDL rats, where it is \nmostly localized. The decrease in the expression of NKCC2, in CAM \nof BDL rats, could lead to a decrease of the interstititial hypertonic -\nity by reducing the reabsorption of sodium, potassium and chloride \nand, consequently, avoiding the subsequent reabsorption of water. \nThe decrease in AQP2 expression could contribute to increase the \nurine output, by decreasing the reabsorption of water in the CD.\n528.

Carrera del Investigador Cient\u00edfico, UNR (CIC-UNR)\nIn previous experiments we observed that pretreatment with the \nAT1R antagonist, losartan, or the AT2R agonist, C21, prevents \nglomerular filtration drop, loss of sodium reabsorption, and loss of \nbrush border in a renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model. On the oth -\ner hand, we have found that I/R decreases the expression of the ad -\nipokine apelin; and in turn the pretreatment with apelin prevents the \nimpairment of proximal tubular transport and has anti-inflammatory \neffects in this model. We also demonstrated that losartan prevents \nthe decreased expression of apelin and its receptor APJ. The aim \nof this study was to evaluate the effects of the AT2R agonist, C21, \non apelin and APJ mRNA levels in an I/R model. Male Wistar rats \n(5-6 per group) underwent unilateral renal ischemia for 40 min fol -\nlowed by 24 h of reperfusion (I/R) or sham surgery (C).

These \nessential nutrients can modify cellular and behavioral processes \nrelated to anxiety, depression and memory. In a previous work, we \nobserved that dietary \u03c93 PUFA deficiency in mouse produced chang -\nes associated with the development of depressive-like behavior -like \nhypermotility and up-regulation of AVP and AVPr1 genes in the hypo -\nthalamus and pituitary, respectively- and reduced the hippocampal \ngene expression of NMDA1, which plays a role in memory formation. \nOn the other hand, \u03c93 PUFAs excess increased the LTP-related \ngene CREB1a. Objectives: to assess the effect of dietary \u03c93 PUFA \nlevel on depressive-like behavior and nitric oxide (NO) level in the \nhippocampus, molecule related to memory formation process. Ma -\nterial and methods: albino Swiss mice were exposed to \u03c93 PUFA \nControl (C; soybean oil, 7%), Deficient (D; sunflower oil, 7%) or Ex -\ncess (E; blend oil; 4.2% cod-liver+2.8% soybean) diet before con -\nception till adulthood, and at this time point, the depressive-like be -\nhavior was evaluated through the tail suspension test (TST) in male \nanimals. After that, animals were euthanized and their hippocampi \ndissected to determine NO level by Griess. Statistics: ANOVA and \nLSD post hoc test. Results: the immobility time (s) in TST was higher \nin D group (79.8\u00b114.7) compared to C (43.3\u00b18.7) and E (59.1\u00b110.8) \ngroups (P<0.05 indicated by LSD post hoc). Furthermore, there were \nno differences in NO level among dietary groups. These results sup -\nport the hypothesis that \u03c93 PUFA deficiency induces depressive-like \npredictive effects, and suggest that the hippocampal NO pathway \nshould not be implicated in the changes on memory gene expression \nproduced by both \u03c93 PUFA deficiency and excess. Further investiga -\ntions are needed to better understand the relevance of dietary PUFA \n\u03c93 in depression and memory.\n530.

Cognitive dysfunction \nrepresents a core diagnostic and symptomatic criterion of MDD, \nand is a principal determinant of functional non-recovery. Venlafax -\nine (VEN), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is \nan antidepressant drug commonly used to treat a wide spectrum \nof mood disorders including treatment-resistant depression. Despite \ndecades of clinical use, the impact of VEN on memory processes \nis still incompletely understood.

After that, animals \nwere euthanized and their hippocampi dissected to determine NO \nlevels by Griess. Statistics: two-way ANOVA test followed by LSD \npost hoc  test whenever appropriate. Results: sham-VEN and OB-S \nanimals showed a memory impairment compared with sham-S an -\nimals (F(1,31)= 12.46, p\u22640.05), and OB-VEN animals exhibited en -\nhanced memory performance in ORT compared to OB-S (p\u22640.05). \nFurthermore, a significant reduction in NO levels was detected in \nOB-S but VEN treatment reversed this effect in OB group (OB-S \n1.25 nmol/\u00b5g protein vs. OB-V 3.79 nmol/\u00b5g protein). These results \nsuggest that VEN counteracts memory impairment in OB animals \nwith participation of the NO pathway. To improve the diagnosis and \ntreatment of depression and its associated cognitive impairments, \na better understanding of the neuropathophysiological basis of this \ndisabling illness is required.\nONCOLOG\u00cdA\n532.

Both cell lines express all RAR isotypes with the exception of \nRAR\u03b2 in 4T1 cells.\nCells were treated with the RAR\u03b1 agonist AM580 (200 nM), RAR\u03b2 \nagonist AC55649 (2 \u03bcM), RAR\u03b3 agonist BMS961 (50 nM) or ve -\nhicle (DMSO). Migratory potential was evaluated by wound heal -\ning assays. AM580 and AC55649 reduced LM38-LP migratory \ncapacity (p<0.05) while AM580 increased migration in 4T1 cells \n(p<0.05). MMPs were analyzed by zymography. AM580, AC55649 \nand BMS961 decreased soluble MMP2 activity in LM38LP. On the \ncontrary, AM580 increased both MMP2 and MMP9 activities in 4T1. \nBesides, AM580 and AC55649 diminished LM38LP adhesive capac -\nity while AC 55649 increased this potential in 4T1. Finally, a lung \ncolonization assay was performed. Cells were pretreated with the \nagonists and then inoculated into syngeneic BALB/c mice. While \nAC55649 increased metastatic potential of LM38-LP cells (p<0.05), \nBMSS961 increased this potential in 4T1 cells (p<0.05).\nWe hypothesize that the differences in RAR\u03b2 expression between \nthe cell lines could be responsible of opposite biological effects ob -\nserved. The increase in metastatic potential after RAR\u03b2/\u03b3 activation \ncould be associated with the selection of a minority population with \nhigh plasticity to colonize the target organ.\n533. (85) INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR 2 mRNA-BINDING \nPROTEIN 1 (IGF2BP1) UPREGULATION BY SORAFENIB \nIN HEPG2 CELLS. ROLE OF SIRTUIN 1 AND 2 (SIRT1/2).\nBucci Mu\u00f1oz M, Semeniuk M, Livore VI, Mottino AD, Ceba -\nllos MP, Ruiz ML.\nInstituto de Fisiolog\u00eda Experimental (IFISE-CONICET), Fac. \nde Cs. Bioq y Farm. Universidad Nacional de Rosario.\nResistance to sorafenib (Sfb) still remains one of the major cause \nof treatment failure in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This con -\ndition often involves ABC-transporters upregulation, like multidrug \nresistance-associated protein 3 (ABCC3), that extrudes Sfb from \nhepatic cells. IGF2BP1 is an oncoprotein highly expressed in HCC \nwhich modulates its target genes by affecting their stability, translat -\nability or localization. In a previous work we showed that IGF2BP1 \nknockdown results in downregulation of ABCC3 in HepG2 cells and \nthat SIRT1/2 inhibitors suppress Sfb-mediated induction of ABCC3. \nAim: To evaluate the effect of Sfb on expression of IGF2BP1 and \nABCC3 proteins and potential mediation by SIRT1/2. Methods : EX-\n527 was used as SIRT1/2 inhibitor. Experimental designs were: I) \nHepG2 cells were treated with 0.75, 2 and 5 \u00b5M Sfb (selected from \na previous dose-response curve) for 48 and 72 h. II) HepG2 cells \nwere treated for 72 h with Sfb (2\u00b5M), EX-527 (40\u00b5M) or both. Re-\nsults:  All results are expressed as % of control (C) and presented \nas mean\u00b1SD, n=3-6, p<0.05. Sfb (2 \u00b5M) increased IGF2BP1 protein \nlevels at 48 h (135\u00b110* vs C: 100\u00b113). After Sfb treatment for 72 h, \nIGF2BP1 protein level was increased at all tested concentrations: \n0.75, 2 and 5 \u00b5M (167\u00b19*, 189\u00b130*, 163\u00b112*, respectively, vs C: \n100\u00b122). ABCC3 protein levels were increased by Sfb 2 \u00b5M both \nat 48 h (154\u00b13* vs C: 100\u00b113) and at 72 h ( 151\u00b115* vs C: 100\u00b120). \nInhibition of SIRT1/2 prevented Sfb from inducing IGF2BP1 (72 \u00b118* \nvs C: 100\u00b110) . Discussion:  Our data suggest that SIRT1/2 proteins \nare involved in IGF2BP1 upregulation by Sfb. It remains unclear if \nthe induction of IGF2BP1 is responsible for ABCC3 upregulation by \nSfb. Experiments silencing IGF2BP1 are currently being performed \nto elucidate this hypothesis. Targeting IGF2BP1 could be a useful \ntool to modulate multidrug associated resistance proteins, at least \nABCC3, in order to minimize the resistance to sorafenib in HCC. \n534.

The \u03b2-galactoside-binding protein galectin-1 \n(Gal1) is up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most \ncommon type of liver cancer. Previously we found that hepato -\ncyte-derived Gal1 promotes liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) \nproliferation and migration, suggesting Gal1 contribution to angio -\ngenesis in liver tumors. Recently, using a proteomic approach we \nidentified CD13 as a novel ligand for Gal1 in human SK-HEP-1 \nLSECs. \nHere, we analyzed CD13 expression in a wide set of human can -\ncer tissues using Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) \ndatabases and in liver tumor samples through UALCAN platform. \nCD13 expression was decreased in HCC samples (n=371) com -\npared with normal tissues (n=50) (p<0.001). No statistical difference \nwas found between individual cancer stages. Kaplan-Meier plotter \nindicated a better survival for low CD13 mRNA expression in liver \ncancer patients (p<0.01). Conversely, high levels of Gal1 correlated \nwith poor overall patient survival (p<0.05).To further understand the \npotential involvement of CD13 in HCC progression and angiogen -\nesis, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis. GO annotation, \nusing GOrilla platform indicated that CD13 co-expressed genes are \nmainly involved in cell surface receptor signaling pathways related \nto cell-cell and canonical Wnt signaling and regulation of cytokine \nsecretion (10-5 >p< 10-3). By Western blot we confirmed CD13 ex -\npression in human HepG2 liver cancer cells and SK-HEP-1 LSECs \nand by Far Western Blot we observed Gal1/CD13 interaction in SK-\nHEP-1 cells. Also, a SK-HEP-1 cell membrane fraction was applied \nto a Gal1-affinity column. Gal1-binding proteins were eluted with lac -\ntose and by Western blot CD13 was confirmed as a ligand for Gal1. \nOur findings encourage the study of the relevance of this interaction \nin angiogenesis during liver tumor progression. \n535.

Our pre -\nvious studies showed that cells derived from renal cell carcinoma \n(RCC) were more sensible to cell death after 72h exposition to 9.6 \nmM NaOH (mild alkalosis) than normal cells. The aim of this study \nwas to investigate if this alkaline condition also affects cell prolifera -\ntion. We use three renal cell models: HK2, derived from normal hu -\nman proximal epithelial cells, 786-O and Caki-1, both derived from \nhuman RCC. We exposed cells to media with 9.6 mM NaOH for \n72h. Then, we estimated cell proliferation by BrdU experiments. Our \nresults show at pH 7.4 both RCC derived cell lines proliferate more \nthan normal HK2 cells (% BrdU+ cells: HK2= 31\u00b12; 786-O= 46\u00b13 \nand Caki-1= 58\u00b13, p<0.05 vs HK2 n=10). Normal HK2 cells were not \naffected by exposure to 9.6mM NaOH for 72hs. However, malignant \nCaki-1 significantly reduced their proliferation (% BrdU+ cells, pH \n7.4= 58\u00b13 vs pH 7.5= 18\u00b13, p<0.001 n=8). Previous studies showed \nthat NHE1 isoform of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1) can favor or inhibit \nproliferation in some experimental models. Then, we inhibited NHE1 \nduring the 72h exposition to 9.6 mM NaOH. In normal cells , NHE1 \ninhibition significantly reduced proliferation in alkaline condition (% \nBrdU+ cells, +NHE1= 37\u00b11 vs -NHE1= 31\u00b11, p<0.05 n=8).

Many of them are \u03b1-SMA + ,FSP \n+ , FAP + , CD34 - and CD31 - spindle cells. CAF can originate \nfrom bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells and can be recog -\nnized by the expression of CD105 and CD146. Interestingly, 50% \nof CAF express CD105 in BC-stroma. Previously, we found that the \nCD34 - spindle-shaped stromal cells from primary tumors of BC pa -\ntients (BCP) express CD105 but we did not observe its expression \nin non-malignant breast tissues. Considering that BCP with bone \nmetastasis (BM) have a median overall survival (OS) from BC di -\nagnosis of 8.7 years, it is imperative to find a biomarker that can \npredict this event. We propose that high CD105 expression could \nbe a prognostic factor of the occurrence of BM in BCP, particularly \nin the luminal subtype which is known to preferentially develop this \ntype of metastasis. In this retrospective study, we investigate the \nclinicopathological significance of CD105 in CAF, as prognostic de -\nterminant of early BCP. We performed immunohistochemical analy -\nsis for CD105 expression in CAF of primary invasive ductal tumors \nfrom early BCP (luminal subtype), and analyzed their association \nwith clinicopathological characteristics. Results showed that high \nCD105 expression in CAF of BCP was significantly associated with \na higher risk of metastatic occurrence (p=0.029), in particular BM \n(p=0.035). Moreover, high CD105 expression was associated with \nshorter disease-free survival (DFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), \nBM free survival (BMFS) and OS (p=0.005, 0.006, 0.013 and 0.008). \nFinally, CD105 expression was an independent prognostic factor for \nDFS, MFS, BMFS and OS (p=0.015, 0.034, 0.041 and 0.040). In \nconclusion, this is the first demonstration that high CD105 expres -\nsion in CAF could be used as prognostic marker of BM occurrence \nand lower DFS, MFS, and OS in early luminal BCP.\nREPRODUCCI\u00d3N\n537.

UBA)Emerging evidence shows that placental aquaporin-9 (AQP9) is not \ninvolved in the transfer of water between the mother and the fetus. \nHowever, its role in human placenta is still unknown.  AQP9 is an \naquaglyceroporin that also permeates other solutes such as lactate. In \nbrain, AQP9 may transport lactate as an alternative energy substrate. \nOBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the participation of AQP9 in \nthe lactate transfer across the human placenta.\nMETHODS: This study was approved by the ethics committee of the \nHospital Nacional Dr. Prof. A. Posadas. Explants from normal term \nplacentas were cultured in low glucose with or without L-lactate, and \nin presence and absence of AQP9 inhibitors (0.3 mM HgCl2, a gen -\neral blocker of AQPs, or 0.5mM Phloretin, to block AQP9). Normal \nglucose medium was used as control. Cell viability was assessed by \nMTT assay and LDH release. Apoptosis indexes were analyzed by \nBax/Bcl-2 protein expression ratio and TUNEL assay.\nRESULTS: In low glucose medium, MTT decreased while LDH \nrelease did not change compared to controls, suggesting that cell \ndeath is not due to necrosis. Moreover, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and apoptotic \nnuclei increased (n=5, p <0.02) and the blocking of AQP9 did not \nabrogate apoptosis. However, when explants were cultured in low \nglucose medium supplemented with L-lactate, explant viability and \napoptotic indexes were similar to controls indicating that L-lactate \ncould be replacing glucose as an energy substrate. In this case, the \nblocking of AQP9 resulted in an increase in cell death (n=4, p <0.05), \nproposing that this protein has a role in lactate transport.\nCONCLUSION: Our results show that placental AQP9 may have \na key role in lactate transport as an alternative energy substrate. \nThus, the blocking of lactate transport mediated by AQP9 negatively \naffects the survival of trophoblast cells.\n538.

In a \nprevious mouse study, we observed that chronic dietary \u03c93 PUFA \ndeficiency produced an increase of bending immature sperm forms, \nwhich in turn can be harmful to sperm migration and oocyte fertil -\nization. Objectives: to assess the effect of dietary \u03c93 PUFA level \non male reproductive capacity in vivo and the oxidative stress in \nepididymal sperm. Material and methods: albino Swiss mice were \nexposed to \u03c93 PUFA Control (soybean oil, 7%), Deficient (sunflower \noil, 7%), or Excess (blend oil; 4.2% cod-liver+2.8% soybean) diet \nbefore conception until adulthood. Five males per treatment were \nindividually mated to two adult females fed with commercial pellet. \nOn gestational day 18, dams were euthanized and their uteri and \novaries dissected to assess: number of live and atrophied fetuses, \nlitter weight, number of corpora lutea and embryo loss. Other eight \nmales per treatment were euthanized, and their epididymides dis -\nsected to evaluate the sperm production of reactive oxygen spe -\ncies (ROS) by chemiluminescence. Statistics: ANOVA and LSD post \nhoc test. Results: no significant differences in the assayed repro -\nductive parameters were found among groups: number of fetuses \n(F(2,26)= 0.63, P=0.53), atrophied fetuses (F(2,26)=0.08, P=0.92), \nlitter weight (F(2,26)=1.17, P=0.32), corpora lutea (F(2,26)= 0.06, \nP=0.93) and percentage of embryo loss (F(2,26)= 1.53, P=0.23). \nRegarding sperm ROS production, no significant differences among ABSTRACTS207\nexperimental groups were found (F(2,21)=0.18, P=0.83). Conclu -\nsions: these results indicate that bending sperm immaturity in PUFA \n\u03c93 deficient mice is not related to higher ROS production and does \nnot affect in vivo fertilization capability. Further investigations are \nneeded to better understand the relevance of dietary PUFA \u03c93 in \nmale fertility.\n539.

Buenos Aires, Argentina\nDuring placentation, human extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells \nneed to proliferate, migrate, and differentiate correctly to ensure pro -\nper placental development. Previously, we reported that caveolae \nare required for the proper migration and endovascular differentia -\ntion of EVT. Recently, we found that hyperosmolarity alters EVT cell \nmigration and invasion. However, up to now, the molecular mecha -\nnism is unknown. We hypothesized that hyperosmolarity increases \ncaveolae endocytosis and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) degradation, altering \nEVT cell differentiation. \nObjectives: Our aim was to explore the effect of hyperosmolarity \non caveolae microdomains and the impact on the EVT cell differ -\nentiation.\nMethods: The human EVT Swan-71 cell line was cultured in com -\nplete DMEM/F-12. 100 mM of sucrose was added to generate the \nhyperosmolar condition. Cell viability was evaluated by 3-(4,5-Di -\nmethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay. \nThe localization of caveolae was analyzed by Transmission Electron \nMicroscopy (TEM). Cav-1 expression was determined by WB in dif -\nferent conditions (isoosmolarity or control and hyperosmolarity, with \nor without MG-132-  a proteasome inhibitor- and NH4Cl- a lysosomal \ninhibitor). Endovascular differentiation was analyzed by the forma -\ntion of tube-like structures in plates coated with Matrigel\u00ae.\nResults: Cell viability was not affected by the experimental condi -\ntions. TEM showed that hyperosmolarity induced the internalization \nof caveolae. In addition, hyperosmolarity also increased Cav-1 pro -\ntein degradation by lysosomal proteolysis (p<0.05, n=3) and signifi -\ncantly reduced the formation of tube-like structures compared to \ncontrol (p<0.05, n=4) .\nConclusion: Our results show that hyperosmolarity leads to the in -\nternalization of caveolae and the degradation of Cav-1, impairing \nendovascular differentiation of EVT cells.\n540.

Altered expression of these pro -\nteins might be associated with oligo and polyhydramnios syndromes. However, we recently observed that the blocking of AQP3 did not pre -\nvent cell swelling in amnion cells. In addition, under osmotic stress the \npattern expression of amnion AQP3 was different from other AQPs, \nsuggesting a different role for this protein. \nOBJETIVE: To study the regulation of AQP3 and its role in the amnion.\nMETHODS: Amnion-derived WISH cells  were cultured in hypo (150 \nmOsm) and hyperosmolar (400 mOsm) conditions. Levels of phos -\nphorylated ERK (pERK), JUNK (pJNK) and p38 (p-p38) were stud -\nied. Nf-\u0138B and tonEBP expressions were assessed in nuclear and \ncytosolic fractions. AQP3 expression was analyzed after the inhibi -\ntion of Nf-\u0138B and tonEBP pathways with Sodium Salicylate and Cy -\nclosporine-A, respectively.  Cell viability was studied by MTT assay. \nApoptosis was studied by TUNEL assay and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio after the \ninhibition of AQP3 using CuSO4 or the specific siRNA. \nRESULTS: pERK levels increased in hyperosmolarity and did not \nchange in hypoosmolarity (p<0.001; n=6). No significant differenc -\nes were observed in p-p38 and pJNK (ns; n=6). Nf-\u0138B and tonEBP \nexpressions increased in nuclear fraction only in hyperosmolarity \n(p<0.05; n=5; p<0.01; n=5). In this condition, the blocking of Nf-\u0138B \npathway increased AQP3 expression (p<0.001; n=5) compared to \ncontrols, while the inhibition of tonEBP pathway did not modify its \nexpression. Regarding cell viability in hiperosmolarity, the blocking \nof AQP3 decreased MTT incorporation (p<0.01; n=8). Moreover, \nBax/Bcl-2 ratio and the number of apoptotic nuclei increased after \nCuSO4 treatment (p<0.001; n=5; p<0.001; n=9) and AQP3 silencing \n(p<0.05; n=5; p<0.01; n=10).\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that AQP3 may have an im -\nportant role in the survival of the amniotic cells and its expression \nmay be regulated by ERK, Nf-\u0138B and tonEBP pathways.\nTOXICOLOG\u00cdA\n541.

The aim \nof this experiment was to determine the neuro-motor and behavioral \nchanges caused by sub-acute administration of Glyph. Male Wistar \nrats 80-90 days old were treated subcutaneously  with a Glyph solu -\ntion (Sigma, without adjuvants) in saline phosphate buffer (PBS). \nOne dose of 70 mg/kg was tested every 48 hours for 14 days (n=12). \nA group of rats was used as control (n=12) that was  injected with the \nvehicle. Body mass was recorded daily. Two tests were carried out \nin control and treated animals to determine the locomotor activity: \nopen field and elevated plus maze, according to established proto -\ncols. The test recording was done through video camera, and then \nthe data and statistical analysis were carried out by t student meth -\nod. We found that Glyph exposed rats showed a decrease in mo -\ntor activity time (p<0.05; p=0.0194) and distance traveled (p<0.05; \np=0.0167) by the open field test. Regarding elevate plus maze test, \nrats exhibited a decrease in motor activity time (p<0.05; p=0.0246). \nOn the other hand, Glyph  exposed animals showed a significant \ndecrease on body weight throughout the treatment (p=0.0001). In \nconclusion, these findings suggest that sublethal doses of Glyph \nexposure alter nervous system functionality impairing motor and \nbehavior parameters.", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
