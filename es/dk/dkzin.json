This article addresses the ethical framework for placebo use in clinical trials assessing vaccine efficacy in pregnant women. Vaccine trial participants are healthy at the outset and some must be infected during the study to demonstrate the product\u2019s efficacy, meaning that placebo-treated participants are under risk of serious and irreversible harm. If effective vaccines exist, such risk precludes placebo use. This interdiction should be extended to any clinical trial of vaccine efficacy in pregnant women, because a demonstration of clinical efficacy in nonpregnant individuals and comparable immunogenic responses in pregnant women are predictors of efficacy in pregnancy as well. Moreover, product effectiveness in real-world use scenarios can be ascertained by observational studies conducted after its inclusion in vaccination campaigns.\nVaccines; Placebos; Clinical study; Bioethics; Therapeutic equipoise; COVID-19; Influenza, human\nResumen\nEl uso de placebo en ensayos cl\u00ednicos es uno de los principales temas debatidos sobre la \u00e9tica en investigaci\u00f3n contempor\u00e1nea cuando existe un tratamiento eficaz probado. Este art\u00edculo aborda la \u00e9tica en el uso de placebo en ensayos cl\u00ednicos sobre la eficacia de vacuna en mujeres embarazadas. Las participantes en los ensayos de vacunas estaban sanas al inicio del estudio, y algunas fueron vacunadas durante el estudio para demostrar la eficacia del producto. Las participantes tratadas con placebo corren el riesgo de sufrir da\u00f1os graves e irreversibles. Si existen vacunas efectivas, este riesgo impide el uso de placebo. Este impedimento debe extenderse a cualquier ensayo cl\u00ednico de eficacia de vacuna en embarazadas, pues la eficacia cl\u00ednica demostrada en mujeres no embarazadas y las respuestas inmunog\u00e9nicas comparables con las embarazadas son predictores de eficacia en el embarazo. Adem\u00e1s, la efectividad del producto se constata en estudios observacionales realizados tras las campa\u00f1as de vacunaci\u00f3n.\nVacunas; Placebos; Estudio cl\u00ednico; Bio\u00e9tica; Equipoise Terap\u00e9utico; Covid-19; Gripe humana\nResumo\nO uso de placebo em ensaios cl\u00ednicos, quando um tratamento comprovadamente eficaz existe, \u00e9 um dos principais t\u00f3picos debatidos na \u00e9tica em pesquisa contempor\u00e2nea.

Participantes em ensaios de vacina s\u00e3o saud\u00e1veis no in\u00edcio e alguns devem ser inoculados durante o estudo para demonstrar a efic\u00e1cia do produto. Ou seja, participantes tratados com placebo est\u00e3o sob risco de danos graves e irrevers\u00edveis. Se existirem vacinas eficazes, esse risco impede o uso de placebo. Essa interdi\u00e7\u00e3o deve ser estendida a qualquer ensaio cl\u00ednico de efic\u00e1cia de vacina em gestantes, pois a demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o de efic\u00e1cia cl\u00ednica em n\u00e3o gestantes e as respostas imunog\u00eanicas compar\u00e1veis em gestantes tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o preditoras de efic\u00e1cia na gravidez.

At the time, the striking and poorly-understood interspecies difference in the susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of thalidomide added to a great hesitancy in including pregnant women in RCT 99.

The enigmatic mode by which thalidomide caused birth defects and the failure to predict its teratogenicity strengthened the uncertainty about whether previous laboratory tests in animals could reliably anticipate developmental toxicity to humans 99.

However, the potential benefits and the foreseeable risks involved in clinically testing drugs are often unbalanced between mother and unborn child.\nMaternal diseases in pregnancy may disrupt placental function and impair embryo-fetal growth and development, and may also result in mother-to-child transmission of infections, birth defects and/or poor health and viability of the unborn child 1111.

In this framework, the presumed unborn child\u2019s interests\u2014made legitimate by a so-called \u201cfetal right to life\u201d\u2014could eventually take precedence over those of a pregnant woman in a variety of medical situations 1919.

That is, refraining from treating a sick pregnant woman from clinically testing drugs with potential benefits for this group may negatively impact the reproductive and fetal health.\nThe strong fetal protectionism in research involving pregnant women was questioned by the 1990s and, to some extent, softened. Not only have various RCT in pregnant women been judged ethically justifiable, but the default exclusion of this specific subpopulation from RCT of potentially beneficial drugs for them is increasingly viewed as discriminatory, unfair and unethical 44.

Pregnant women are fully capable of protecting their own interests and those of their unborn children for whom they are responsible as any mentally competent adult. If a pregnant woman is not underage, has no significant intellectual disability, and fully understood the risks and benefits of the research for herself and her fetus, one should assume that she can provide valid informed consent (IC) to participate in RCT 44.

The use of placebo-controlled arms in RCT to test the efficacy of vaccines or prophylactic methods is a pivotal ethical issue in clinical research during pregnancy.\nEthical issues\nUse of inactive (placebo) comparators in randomized controlled trials\nThe use of placebo controls in RCT, if effective and safe treatments for the disease or condition under investigation exist, is one of the most debated topics in contemporary clinical research ethics.\nOne of the cornerstones of medical professional ethics is that physicians are morally obliged to offer their patients the treatment(s) they believe to best meet their individual clinical needs. Physicians are bound to the combined beneficence-nonmaleficence bioethical principle by the Hippocratic Oath \u2014\u201cto help (to do good) or at least to do no harm\u201d\u2014, a professional commitment that holds true for both a physicians\u2019 clinical practice and their involvement in clinical research 2525.

The term equipoise means an equilibrium state or situation in which things are perfectly balanced. Thus, according to the principle, clinical researchers must be in a state of genuine uncertainty about the relative efficacy (and/or safety) of the therapeutic interventions under comparison to render a RCT ethical.\nThe concept of equipoise was considered unworkable in research practice, so, a proposition to replace it with that of \u201cclinical equipoise\u201d was made, referring to a situation in which a collective professional uncertainty about the treatment alternatives would exist or, in Freedman\u2019s words, when there is no consensus within the expert clinical community about the comparative merits of the alternatives to be tested 2727.

RCT using active comparators indicate whether an experimental drug (or vaccine) is more effective and safer, noninferior (noninferiority trials), or worse than an existing one of proven efficacy and safety 2828.

In contrast, placebo control trials show whether the drug/vaccine is efficacious and safe in absolute terms.\nAlthough RCT using active comparators can also yield compelling evidence of drug (or vaccine) efficacy and safety, under specific circumstances, placebo-controlled trials offer methodological advantages, some of which were presented and discussed elsewhere 2828.

The social value of a study depends on the foreseeable contribution of the data that it collects\u2014typically in conjunction with data from other studies\u2014to improve health care, public health and, sometimes, attenuate unfair inequalities in medicine. Social value is a key requirement to render RCT ethically acceptable and is endorsed by the DoH, Brazilian regulations and most authors 3030. Wendler D, Rid A.

Whatever might be the alleged social value of a RCT, if a proven effective and safe treatment option exists, any risk of serious and irreversible health harm is unacceptable.\nA unique ethical problem of RCT in pregnancy is that a pregnant woman implicitly consents for herself and the unborn child for whom she is responsible. The validity of consent based on altruism, and not on prospects of direct health benefits, that was given by a legal representative (mother) on behalf of someone else (unborn child) who is incompetent (or unable to do it), is a delicate ethical issue that needs further clarification.\nThe general assumption is that in the absence of reasonable prospects of direct health benefits for the woman or fetus, anticipated fetal risks greater than minimal is an obstacle to conduct RCT in pregnancy.\nAccording to the FDA guidance draft, one of the key conditions to be met by a RCT in pregnancy is that (\u2026) if there is no such prospect of benefit, the risk to the fetus is not greater than minimal and the purpose of the research is the development of important biomedical knowledge which cannot be obtained by any other means 3131.

Paumgartten. Op. cit. p. 491. .\nThe first explicit reference to the prohibition of placebo controls appeared in the DoH\u2019s fourth revision, made in 1996: In any medical study, every patient\u2014including those of a control group, if any\u2014should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method. This does not exclude the use of inert placebo in studies where no proven diagnostic or therapeutic method exists 3434. Paumgartten. Op. cit. p. 491. .\nThe fifth revision, made in 2000, clearly informed that the prohibition of placebo use in RCT applies not only to therapeutic and diagnostic interventions, but also to prophylactic methods: The benefits, risks, burdens, and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic, or therapeutic method exists 3434. Paumgartten. Op. cit. p. 491. .\nAs of 2008, the seventh DoH revision, the strict interdiction was loosened, and the use of placebo control arms in RCT, when proven effective interventions exist, was allowed where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons, the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive placebo, or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm 3434. Paumgartten. Op. cit. p. 491. .\nAlong the same line, the Brazilian Code of Medical Ethics also prohibits physicians of maintaining (\u2026) any type of connection with clinical studies in humans using a placebo as the sole medical intervention, whenever there is an effective prophylactic or therapeutic method available 3535.

This is detailed in the World Health Organization\u2019s recommendations for clinical studies of vaccine efficacy 3636. Orenstein WA, Bernier RH, Dondero TJ, Hinman AR, Marks JS, Bart KJ et al.

DOI: 10.1590/0102-311X00007221 .\nRegarding research ethics, an almost unsurmountable obstacle to using placebos in RCT of prophylactic interventions when proven effective vaccines exist, is that, depending on the disease/condition to be prevented, no intervention or administering an inactive comparator (placebo) to control arm participants implies in subjecting them to risk of serious or irreversible harm 3434. Paumgartten. Op. cit. p. 491. that could be minimized or averted using an active comparator (for example, another vaccine of proven efficacy).\nTherefore, the DoH\u2019s exception that would render the use of placebo controls in some RCT acceptable when comparators of proven efficacy exist is not readily applicable for prophylactic interventions. For instance, in RCT of vaccines against potentially severe and life-threatening respiratory viral infections, such as COVID-19 and some influenza viruses, not to vaccinate control arms participants means taking risks of serious and irreversible harm that could be prevented.\nIf a previous RCT demonstrated the efficacy of other vaccines for the infection under investigation, further studies on immunizing products for the same contagious disease must always use active comparators instead of inactive ones 3737. Oliveira ACAX, Paumgartten FJR. Ethical issues in placebo-controlled trials of covid-19 vaccines. Cad Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica [Internet]. 2021 [acesso 10 jan 2023];37(6):e00007221. DOI: 10.1590/0102-311X00007221 . This holds true for any vaccine efficacy trial involving men and/or women, be them pregnant or not.\nTrials of vaccines and other prophylactic interventions in pregnant women\nDrug therapies and prophylactic interventions intended for treating both nonpregnant and pregnant women are usually first tested in adult men and nonpregnant women and, if proven to be efficacious and safe for this population, an additional RCT is conducted with pregnant women 3838.

Dispon\u00edvel: https://bit.ly/3HOx0WV\n[https://bit.ly/3HOx0WV...\n](https://bit.ly/3HOx0WV) .\nThe pregnant population being last in a stepwise approach is a precautionary measure since not only a complete dataset from nonclinical safety studies\u2014developmental and reproductive toxicity animal tests (DART)\u2014will be available, but also clinical data on the efficacy and safety for adults, for a thorough assessment of risks for the mother and unborn child 3838.

Conversely, if a previous RCT fails to demonstrate efficacy in nonpregnant women, mothers and fetuses are spared from being unnecessarily exposed to interventions likely to be ineffective for them as well.\nAs far as a vaccine or another prophylactic method is concerned, the inclusion of placebo or no treatment groups in studies designed to primarily assess the safety\u2014not the clinical efficacy\u2014of the intervention for pregnant women does not necessarily expose placebo-recipient mothers and their fetuses to a significant risk of serious and irreversible harm, if the trial duration is sufficiently short, concomitant non-pharmacological measures of protection are taken, and the unprotected participants receive a proven effective vaccine as soon as possible after the trial blinding code is broken and the obtained data can be analyzed.\nIn other words, if safety and not clinical efficacy is the primary goal of the study, a somewhat higher risk for placebo control group participants remains but the excess can be minimized so the risks taken by control and experimental trial arm participants tend to be similarly low.\nThe inclusion of no treatment or placebo controls in studies testing the clinical efficacy of vaccine/prophylactic methods unavoidably subject healthy participants to a risk of serious and irreversible harm. If the vaccine (or prophylactic intervention) is indeed effective, said risk should be higher than that taken by participants allocated to the experimental arm. In fact, some of the unprotected subjects must get sick during the trial to reach the target number of infected participants required to eventually prove or refute the hypothesis that the immunizing product (vaccine) is effective 3636.

Moreover, as far as vaccines are concerned, clinical researchers are aware that, in previous phase 1-2 trials in pregnant women, the tested product elicited clinically-relevant immunogenic responses (such as increase in blood levels of neutralizing antibodies) 3939.

Under these circumstances, it is very unlikely that immunizing products proven to be efficacious and safe for nonpregnant women, would fail to confer a clinically meaningful degree of protection for pregnant ones. Acquired maternal protection extends to the unborn child because the neutralizing antibodies\u2014acquired by natural infection or vaccination\u2014are transferred through the placenta and, after birth, breast milk 4242.

In this specific case, the control group participants are exposed to risks of serious health harms to confirm the protective efficacy that had been anticipated by previous trials with the same product, that is, that the immunizing agent being tested is clinically effective for pregnant women as well.\nDepending on the contagious disease preventable by immunization, the detrimental health consequences of inactive comparators (placebos) for pregnant women may be greater than the detrimental health consequences of inactive comparators for nonpregnant women and men. For instance, it was reported that, compared to their nonpregnant counterparts, pregnant women present higher rates of morbidity and mortality associated with some respiratory viral infections such as influenza (H1N1) and COVID-19 1515.

Resulting in pregnant women being generally considered a priority group in vaccination campaigns against these respiratory viral infections.\nIn summary, even if there is no clinical study on the efficacy of the immunizing product in pregnant women, a proof of its efficacy for nonpregnant women, allied to a nonclinical and clinical demonstration that it is safe in pregnancy, and an immunogenic response of clinically meaningful magnitude in pregnant women, must be considered sufficient to assume that\u2014until proof to the contrary\u2014the product is effective (and safe) in pregnancy as well.\nIn other words, in RCT that were designed to confirm the efficacy for a pregnant population of a vaccine proven to be effective (and safe) for nonpregnant women, that caused a strong immunogenic response in pregnant women, and that the preclinical studies showed no evidence that it could be developmentally toxic, there would exist no compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons [to affirm that] the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of the intervention 3434. Paumgartten. Op. cit. p. 491. .\nAnyhow, since a placebo (or no treatment) group in trials of vaccine efficacy implies in taking a significant risk of serious or irreversible harm 3434. Paumgartten. Op. cit. p. 491. for control participants, be them pregnant or not, the exception opened by DoH guidance for placebo use\u2014whenever a proven effective intervention exists\u2014is not applicable.\nAdditionally, even if the efficacy of a new vaccine was not directly assessed by placebo-controlled RCT, the degree to which pregnant women are protected by this immunizing product (that is, vaccine effectiveness in real-world scenarios) can be assessed by observational studies. This confirmation of effectiveness and safety by epidemiological studies is feasible if pregnant females are vaccinated with the product in mass immunization campaigns.\nFor example, an observational longitudinal study involving a large cohort with 10,861 vaccinated pregnant women (COVID-19 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine) matched to 10,861 unvaccinated pregnant controls, was conducted after a mass vaccination campaign took place in Israel 4444.

The estimated vaccine effectiveness\u2014after the second dose\u2014was 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89\u2013100%) for any proven symptomatic infection and 97% (91\u2013100%) and 89% (95%CI, 43\u2013100%) for SARS-CoV-2 infection-related hospitalizations, an effectiveness that was comparable to that estimated for the general population 4444.

DOI: 10.1038/s41591-021-01490-8 .\nThe data yielded by the large observational study in women immunized with a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine during pregnancy are consistent with the standpoint presented here that a strong immunogenic response in a pregnant population, paired with a previously demonstrated efficacy for nonpregnant women, reliably predicts a product\u2019s efficacy for pregnant women 4444.

The assumption that the same holds true for other COVID-19 vaccines\u2014such as inactivated virus and adenoviral vector-based immunizing agents\u2014is thus plausible.\nIn summary, using placebos instead of active comparators is ethically unacceptable in any RCT, if effective and safe therapeutic or prophylactic treatments for the disease exist and if \u201cno treatment\u201d or inactive comparators entail risks of serious or irreversible harm to participants. Studies of clinical efficacy of vaccines unavoidably leave participants of untreated control or placebo control groups unprotected, and thus at an increased risk of getting infected. Therefore, if available, an active comparator must be employed in these cases.\nWe suggest that this reasoning should be extended to encompass any use of placebo in phase-3 RCT of vaccines in pregnancy. We maintain that a clear demonstration of vaccine efficacy for nonpregnant women and men, and a comparable immunogenic response in pregnant women is sufficient to reliably predict the efficacy for this female population, a highly plausible hypothesis to be further confirmed by observational studies of vaccine effectiveness in real world scenarios of use. In addition to entailing risks of serious harm for the unvaccinated participants, no \u201ccompelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons\u201d supporting the view that using placebos is necessary in this case exists.\nFinal considerations\nPregnant women are underrepresented in clinical trials of drugs potentially beneficial for them and such research participation inequality has been increasingly questioned. In general, when a drug or prophylactic method (vaccine) is intended to be used by nonpregnant and pregnant women, it is first clinically tested in the nonpregnant population and, if proven effective and safe for this population, a confirmatory phase-3 trial is performed with pregnant ones. This order of testing is expected to better protect the mother and unborn child.\nHowever, trials involving a pregnant population present an ethical problem if the clinical efficacy is determined by comparing data from a test intervention arm with those of a placebo control arm. As explicitly stated in the DoH, placebo use is ethically inadmissible if a proven effective and safe intervention for the medical condition under investigation is available. If so, an active comparator should be used to ascertain the clinical efficacy of the test product. The 2008 revision of the DoH presents an exception allowing the use of placebo if effective treatment exists, if there are compelling scientific reasons to use an inactive comparator (or no treatment) in the trial, and only if the placebo use does not imply in exposing trial participants to risks of serious and/or irreversible harm.\nWhen a trial is performed to investigate the clinical efficacy of a vaccine, participants allocated to a placebo control arm, pregnant or not, are unavoidably exposed to the infectious agent\u2014they remain unprotected\u2014and, consequently, to risks of serious and irreversible harm. Therefore, if there are proven effective and safe vaccines, using an active comparator instead of an inactive one is an ethically mandatory procedure.\nIn this article, we defend that an ethical concern on the use of placebo exists, even if there is no vaccine demonstrated to be clinically effective in pregnant women. As part of a stepwise clinical research, the clinical efficacy of an immunizing product in pregnancy occurs after previous studies confirmed its effectiveness and safety for nonpregnant women. Moreover, by the time tests in pregnant women begin, clinical efficacy and safety for nonpregnant women and men has already been demonstrated, in addition to the availability of nonclinical and clinical data on the safety for pregnant women, and on the magnitude of the immunogenic response induced in this population, a reliable surrogate predictor of overall clinical efficacy.\nUnder those circumstances, a question comes to light: Would it be ethically acceptable to expose a group of placebo-treated pregnant women to serious/irreversible harm solely to confirm what the previously obtained clinical data had strongly indicated?\nThe fact that some vaccine-preventable infections pose greater health risks for pregnant women than for their nonpregnant counterparts bolsters the argument that placebo use in trials of vaccine efficacy in pregnancy is unethical.\nFinally, we emphasize that the efficacy and safety of a vaccine for pregnant women can be reliably assessed by observational studies conducted after the product is used in mass vaccination campaigns that do not exclude this specific population 4545.
