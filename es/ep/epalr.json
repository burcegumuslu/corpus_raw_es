He is currently Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering and, \nby cour tesy, of Materials Science and Engineering and Terman Faculty \nFellow. Dr. Cargnello is the recipient of several awards including the \nSloan Fellowship in 2018, the Mitsui Chemicals Catalysis Science Award \nfor Creative Work in 2020, and the Early Career Awar d in Catalysis from \nthe ACS Catalysis Division in 2022. General goals of the research in the Cargnello group pertain \nto solving energy and environmental challenges. Uniform and tailored nanocrystals and \nnanostructures are synthesized, studied and used for energy and environmental applications \nthrough catalytic processes, with emphasis on how to precisely control their structure to \nunderstand and exploit interactions between well -defined building blocks.   \nUnderstanding and Engineering Catalytic \nMaterials Usi ng Nanocrystal Precursors  \nCatalytic processes are central to the goal of a sustainable future. A promising approach in \ndeveloping catalytic materials is represented by the design of catalytic sites based on the \nknowledge of structure -property relationships , and in the precise synthesis of thes sites at the \natomic level. Colloidal nanocrystals, with tunable active sites and compositions, can help in this \nmission. The goal of this talk is to show how this approach can provide not only fundamental \nunderstandin g of catalytic reactions, but also a way to precisely engineer reaction sites to \nproduce efficient catalysts that are active, stable and selective for several important \ntransformations. Advances in the synthesis of these materials will be presented. Exampl es of the \nuse of these building blocks as supported systems or in combination with hybrid organic \nmaterials will be shown, both to understand trends in methane and CO 2 activation, and in the \npreparation of optimized catalytic systems combining multiple ac tive phases. In all these \nexamples, important efforts to obtain precious structure -property relationships will be \nhighlighted, with this knowledge used to prepare more efficient and stable catalysts for reducing \nthe emission of greenhouse gases and for the  sustainable production of fuels and chemicals.  \n  \n \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n8  \n \nEDUARD LLOBET, PhD  \nBIO \nIEEE Senior Member, PhD from the UPC -Barcelona Tech (1997).

By supporting p -type metal oxide NPs (e.g. Pd, Cu, Ni, Co or Ir oxides) \non n -type metal oxide NWs, both chemical and electronic sensitization effects can be obtained, \nwhich can dramatically tune the response to target gases of the resulting hybrid nanomaterials, \nthus enabling the engineering of selectivity.

However, this equation is no longer valid for rough and \ninhomogeneous surfaces. Instead, Wenzel (1936) and Ca ssie\u2013Baxter (1944) have proposed \nalternative equations that take into account the roughness and inhomogeneity, respectively. In \nthis talk we present an approach based on the equation of state (EQS) that describes very well \nthe wetting of liquids on a rough  surface using an effective surface tension, this implicitly \ncontains information about roughness, liquid -surface interaction and inhomogeneities. Indeed, \nexperimental results show that the liquid and surface polarity is an important issue in wetting \non ro ugh surfaces. These results shown that low polar liquids show little dependence on \nroughness of a low polar surface, while the high polar liquids are very sensitive to it. As \nconsequence, the calculated contact angles by EQS and by the surface tension comp onents (STC) \nwere close to experimental values only for high polar liquids, while low polarity liquids differ \ngreatly from them.  \n \n \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n11  \n \nKARIM SAPAG, PhD  \nBIO \nProf. Sapag has a bachelor\u2019s degree in Physics from the National \nUniversity of San Luis (UNSL), Argentina, and a Doctorate in \nSciences degree from the Autonomous University of Madrid, \nSpain.

In \nArgentina, Prof Sapag will chair the next Iberoamerican Symposium of Adsorption in 2023.  \nAdsorption and Nanoporous Materials for Energy, Environ ment \nand Health Applications  \nSolid materials with pores up to a few nanometers (nanoporous) are essential in Material \nScience owing to their diverse applications, mainly in the Energy, Environment, and Health fields. \nThese applications involve surface process as adsorption, taking advantage of the nanoporous \nmaterials texture and chemical composition. The texture of a solid refers to its specific surface \narea, pore volume, and pore size distribution; being gas adsorption the most used process to  \ncharacterize these properties. However, special care must take when using this technique, which \nfaces specific difficulties mainly associated with the pores'  size and surface groups'  presence.  \nThis lecture will address some aspects of the gas adsorption t echnique using N2, Ar, and CO2 to \ncharacterize nanoporous materials. The selected materials are nanoporous solids: activated \ncarbons, zeolites, carbon nanotubes, ordered mesopores materials, metal - organic -framework, \nand pillared clays. These materials wil l apply using adsorption to store H2 and CH4 (Energy) or \ncapture CO2 (Environment) or release drugs (Health), discussing their properties; influence on \nthe performance of the selected application.  \n \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n12  \n \nMARIA LAURA SORIANO, P hD \nBIO \nM.

Amongst them, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and carbon \nquantum dots (CQDs) became the most explored in  the field of Analytical Nanoscience and \nNanotechnology to improve analytical methods at any step of the sample treatment or detection \nstage.  \nIn this communication we take advantage of the fact that solid, gel and liquid nanoparticle \nformats affect to thei r properties and so to their ability to interact with certain (bio)molecules. \nIn this sense, supramolecular interactions of nanoparticles in various media conditioned their \napplicability when they are dispersed in aqueous or organic media or even in a gel format. In \nthis communication, various lines of research aiming at designing carbon -based nanodots as \nanalytical tools are discussed, focusing on their excellent abilities as sensing probes for detecting \n(bio)molecules or nanosized structures in different environmental compartments. Regarding \nGQDs, it is highlighted the use of GQDs in liquid medium for determining specific drugs, GQDs \nin hydrogels for selective sensing explosives, and GQD aerogels for selective sorption and \nsensing of pesticides. On the oth er hand, we will briefly comment the use of GQDs for sensing \nand elucidating a food -colouring additive when found free or encapsulated into micelles.  \n \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n13  \n \nTHOMAS J.

Considering the COVID -19 \npandemic, constant struggles with cancer, and an emerging crisis i n antibiotic resistant bacteria, \nto just name a few on -going healthcare problems, we need innovative ideas. Non -medical fields \nhave advanced considerably in new material design, from using sensors to drive cars and touch \nscreen pads for electronics. Innova tion in biomaterials has been lagging behind. This \npresentation will cover some of the more innovative biomaterials than can meet today's \nchallenges including the use of implantable sensors, 4D printed materials in which material  \nshape can be controlled re motely after implantation, smart nanomaterials that can seek out and \npassivate viruses and bacteria, and so much more.

This work is unique because, for the \nfirst time, the deposition of AZO is investigated over complex 3D structures, which are other \nthan polymer -based material. The influence of compound 3D sample mo rphology, surface \nroughness, and ZrO 2 crystallographic phase (tetragonal and monoclinic) on the quality and \nproperties of the deposited AZO thin films is studied. Three different Al dopant concentrations \n(4.0 %, 4.5 %, and 5.0 %) are investigated and compa red to undoped ZnO. The electronic \nproperties of grown films are investigated using Hall effect measurements. The AZO witness film \npreserves low resistivity ( \u03c1) values in the order of 1.1x10-3 \u03a9 cm, which is expected to be similar \nto the AZO located over t he 3D printed ZrO 2 structure. The presented results are a step toward \ndimensionally refined optoelectronic devices, in which the thin AZO films can serve a key \nenabling role, such as a transparent electrode.                                                                                    \nKeywords:  atomic layer deposition, transparent conductive oxides, two -photon lithography, \nthin films, AZO, ZrO 2 \nAuthor for correspondence:  joelarr88@gmail.com  \nThis work was partially supported by the Proyecto Bilateral Co nacyt -AFOSR CC0015 -2016 -05-\n279915 \u201cSINGLE CRYSTAL AND THIN FILM HYBRID PEROVSKITE MATERIALS FOR \nOPTOELECTRONIC  APPLICATIONS\" and by the Proyecto  interno  22-06, referenced  as Proyecto \n#24006 at CIMAV.   \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n16  \n \n [ ALD -341 ]  Deposition of titanium nitride (TiN) films and compatible \nhigh -k dielectrics via ALD processes.  \nDenisse Cort \u00e9s Salinas (denisse.cortess@alumno.buap.mx) 2 , Joaqu \u00edn Alvarado \nPulido 2 , Salvador Alc \u00e1ntara Iniesta 2 , Victor Dossetti Romero 2 , Dylan Tepatzi \nXahuentitla 2 , Yasir Noori 1  \n1 Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK  \n2 Posgrado en Dispositivos Semiconductores, Benem \u00e9rita Universidad Aut \u00f3noma de \nPuebla, M \u00e9xico \nTitanium nitride (TiN) is a material with a Hardness Vick ers of 1800 -2100 kgf/mm\u00b2, a \nsuperconducting critical temperature of Tc~6 K, an electron mobility for thin films of 5 \u2014 20 \ncm\u00b2/V - s and a resistivity at 25 \u00b0C of < 300 \u03bcOhm  - cm. Also, TiN is one of the highest known KI \nmaterials (Kinetic Inductance), which makes it suitable for quantum application junctions.  \nThen thermal and plasma -assisted processes employing atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactor \nwere used to obtain TiN.

In terms of fabrication, PSCs with inorganics hole transporting \nlayers are highly promising due to electrical and optical properties. In this study, atomic layer \ndeposition (ALD) of 10 nm NiO films were performed using nickel (II) acetylacetonate (Ni(acac) 2) \nas nickel precursor combined with ozone (O 3) or water (H 2O) as co -reactant at different \ntemperatures of substrates (250\u00b0C -300\u00b0C) on glass. Where, the growth per cycle (GPC) depends \non the substrate an d oxidant agent, respectively. At 300\u00b0C the GPC is favored using ozone as co -\nreactant with a GPC of 0.09 /c for all samples. Also, with H 2O as co -reactant, the GPC is lower, \naround 0.05 /c respectively.

Three sets of four samples were prepared, each sample with a t otal thickness of the \nnanolaminate of 54.5 \u00b1 0.8 nm. The nominal thicknesses of the HY bilayers of the four samples \nwere 0.5:0.5 nm, 1:1 nm, 2:2 nm, and 5:5 nm After the deposition, two of the sets were annealed \nin N 2 atmosphere for 1 hour at 500 \u00b0C and 75 0 \u00b0C, respectively. The third set was used as control \nsamples. The optical behavior of the ultrathin nanolaminate structures was studied as a function \nof the HY bilayer thickness and annealing temperature. The thickness and optical parameters \nwere analyzed  via spectroscopic ellipsometry to gain information about the optical constants \nand bandgap values. An increase of the refractive index was found when the HY bilayer thickness \ndecreased from 5:5 nm to 0.5:0.5 nm for both annealing temperatures as well as f or the as -\ndeposited sample, while the optical bandgap varied between 3.8 eV and 4.5 eV. The obtained \nresults demonstrate the viability of HY ultrathin nanolaminate structures as a dielectric material \nfor application in electronic and/or optoelectronic devi ces. Furthermore, the optical properties \ndependence on the bilayer thickness and annealing temperature could offer the possibility to \ndesign, fabricate, and improve samples with tunable optical properties at the nanoscale.  \nKeywords: Ultrathin nanolaminates; tunable optical properties; atomic layer deposition; \nthermal treatment.   \nAcknowledgments : This work was partially supported by Basic Science projects 2017 - 2018 A1 -\nS-21084 and A1 -S-21323, FORDECYT - CONACYT 272894, and DGAPAUNAM, through re search \nprojects: PAPIIT IN103220, IN112117, IN110018, IN113219, and AG200320.

The titanium nitride (TiN) has emerged as possible material with metallic \nbehavior due to high stability and chemical compatibility with the underlying dielectric material. \nThis work shows the synthesis of TiN thin films by ALD to study the effect of deposit parameters \nand post -synthesi s annealing on film resistivity. TiN films were deposited on silicon (111) by \natomic layer deposition (ALD) using titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) and ammonium gas (NH 3) as \nprecursors varying the deposited cycles and annealing films under vacuum and ventilatin g \nthese. The chemical analysis by XPS showed TiN as a surface layer and titanium oxynitride \n(TiOxNy) as an interface between the substrate and surface layer, which proposed a layer model: \nCO (adventitious) / TiN / TiOxNy / SiO 2 / Si (111) [2]. The layer mo del thickness shows that TiN \nlayer increases with deposition number cycles (according ellipsometry thickness measurements \nas well). The low or high resistivity behavior in TiN films deposited between 25 and 120 cycles \nare strongly thickness -ratio dependent  on the TiN/TiOxNy layers.  In addition films presented a \ntemperature dependence during annealing. Based on the analysis the film deposited at 25 cycles \nshowed 5nm thickness and 284 \u03bc\u03a9-cm of resistivity, which suggests a metallic behavior, suitable \nfor MOS -type devices. Ellipsometry analysis by dielectric \u2013 extinction coefficient supported a \noptical metallic tendency.  \nKeywords:  ALD, elipsometry, TiON, metallic, XPS  \nAuthor for correspondence:  pierre.mani@uacj.mx  \nOne reference:  [1] M.

In this work, we present the \nmethodology for the growth of Ti xHfyOz films by APLD. A series of films that vary Hf pulse times \nare compared  with TiO 2, HfO 2 nanolaminates. Films were deposited on Si (100) wafers at a \ngrowth temperature of 250\u00b0C with a total of 100 cycles. One cycle consists of a complete oxygen \nlayer, then in the next atomic layer a partial layer of Hf atoms is completed with Ti atoms. The \nfilms were obtained, and the thickness, density and roughness were determined by X ray \nreflectivity (XRR). The thickness varies from 9 to 39 nm. The density of APLD films varies from 7.4 \nto 4.6 g/cm3. These values are intermediate values betw een the densities obtained in HfO 2 and \nTiO 2 of 9.1 and 4.5 g/cm3, respectively. With this innovative methodology, it is possible to deposit \nthin films with two different atoms, in this work Hf and Ti, on the same atomic layer. This opens \nthe possibility of exploring the different characteristics and properties of traditional \nnanolaminates.  \nKeywords: ALD-APLD, TixHfyOz films, XRR . \nThis work was supported by:  CONACyT M\u00e9xico - 2do a\u00f1o de continuidad de estancias \nposdoctorales por M\u00e9xico modalidad  1 of M.

However, their short shelf -life, associated with \ndeterioration rate, is one of the most important issues that should be enhanced [Halonen, et. \nal., 2020; Ochoa -Velasco et. al., 2014 ]. Particularly, strawberry is one of the fruits with a very \nshort shelf -life, main ly, because of fungal contamination and due its delicate tissue. Therefore, \ndiminishing the rate of deterioration is one of the most important challenges to guarantee \nflavour, colour, and nutritional value. In this context, recently has been studied edible  coatings \nto extend the shel -life and quality of fruits and vegetables. Some edible coatings like chitosan \npossess antimicrobial characteristics [Trevi \u00ed\u0192\u00c2\u00b1o -Garza, et. al., 2015; Ziv, et. al., 2021]. The aim \nof this work was to evaluate the effect of chitosan -ZnO edible coating on the physicochemical, \nantioxidant, microbiological and sensorial properties of fresh strawberries. Strawberries were \nsubmerged into a chitosan -ZnO solution (dissolved in acetic acid) for 4 and 8 seconds. To \nevaluate the efficacy of the coating, the colour and humidity in coated and uncoauted samples \nwere measured, firstly using only chitosan; where L indicates the bright red, a (c hromatid) \nindicates the intensity in the red colour, and b (chroma) indicates the colour intensity. L values \n\u00e1re higher for coated strawberries. The mumidity at day 1 increased as the immersion time \nincreased; after 10 days of applied the coating, this par ameter decreased to 88.1% for 4 and 8 s \nof immersion. The uncoated strawberry diminished the humidity to 83.5% in the same time; it \nmay be concluded that the coating helps to maintain the fruit freshness, which can be attractive \nto the consumer. Concerning  the appearence, the samples coated with the chitosan solution \nlook less damage at day 10, compared to those that were not coated; it is evident the damage \nof the uncoated samples, in which fungus has appeared. Experiments where the incorporation \nof 5% ZnO  nanopartices into the chitosan solution are now conducted; results will be presented \nduring the congress. It is expected that parameters like taste, colour and smell will not be \naffected.  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n27  \n \n[ BIO -109 ]  CELLULOSE EXTRACTION FROM ALOE VERA RIND FOR THE \nFORMULATION OF BIODEGRADABLE FILMS  \nOscar Ju \u00e1rez Vidal (juarezvidaloscar@gmail.com) 1 , Juana Deisy Santamar \u00eda Ju\u00e1rez \n(deisy.santamaria@correo.buap.mx) 3 , Edgar Garc \u00eda Hern \u00e1ndez 1 , Manuel S \u00e1nchez Cant \u00fa 3 , Ma.

Howe  ver, its excessive use has contributed to \nthe deterioration of the environment. In addition to this, pollution caused by the emission of \ntoxic gases, infertility of the soil and the generation of harmful fauna from the agro -industrial \nwaste of Aloe vera  has taken interest (Bachheti et al.,  2021); Therefore, the objective of this work \nis to extract cellulose from Aloe vera  rind for the production of biofilms. The characterization of \nthe biomass was carried out by percentage of humidity, ashes, inf rared spectrophotometry \n(FTIR -ATR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM -EDS) and x -ray diffraction (DRX). Cellulose \nextraction was carried out by acid hydrolysis with 0.05 N HCl at 70 \u00b0C for 2 h, and subsequent \ndelignification by alkaline method with 4% NaOH  at 70 \u00b0C for 2 h. Subsequently, the extracted \ncellulose was subjected to a bleaching process with NaClO 2 at 80 \u00b0C for 8 h, washed with distilled \nwater, filtered and dried. Biofilms were obtained using the solvent evaporation technique. The \ncharacterizatio n of the biomass presented 89.54 \u00b1 0.40% humidity and 1.85 \u00b1 0.08% ash, in the \nFTIR -ATR spectra the characteristic vibrations to cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin molecules \nwere identified, SEM -EDS analysis showed a morphology of irregular scales compose d of K in \n25.93%, Ca in 25.26% and Mg in 2.98% by mass. The crystalline structure analyzed by DRX gave \nrise to a diffraction spectrum with signals in 13.13\u00b0, 14.02\u00b0 and 24.20\u00b0 in 2 \u03b8, characteristic of \ncellulose. A series of biofilms were obtained with a th ickness of 50 to 200 microns, homogeneous \nand free of imperfections.  \nKeywords:  aloe vera, biofilms, biopolymer, cellulose.  \nAuthor for correspondence: deisy.santamaria@correo.buap.mx    \nReference: A.

A technique \nthat promises to generate structures for such applications is melt spinning, in which \nbiocompatible materials like the polymer polycaprolactone (PCL), which has a melting point \nbetween 59 and 64 \u00b0C and a degradation period of two years can be used. In this work, a thyristor \ntrigger control was used to control the temperature of the spinning technique. In addition, the \ntemperature sensing and speed control of a stepper motor was em ployed to store the thread \non a bobbin. On the contrary to the on -off control, the variation of the angle of the thyristor \nfavors direct temperature control, since the voltage that feeds the thermal resistance is \ncontrolled. On the other hand, the LabVIEW program was used as the interface between the \nuser and the control. Moreover, a pair of microcontrollers were used, one for zero crossing \ndetection and SCR firing and another for temperature sensing and stepper motor speed control. \nFinally, the system was integrated into an optical plate for testing and adjustment, obtaining \nfibers of approximately 0.14 mm. This research aims to use this polymeric fiber melt spinning \ntechnique for the formation of carbon nanotubes and nanofibers for medical applications.  \nKeywords:  LabVIEW, melt spinning, biocompatibility, PCL   \nAuthor for correspondence:  jimenezp@fis.cinvestav.mx  \nThis work was supported by:  SIP project, COFAA and CONACYT  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n29  \n \n[ BIO -211 ] Correlation of albumin and creatinine studied in photoacoustic \nspectrosco py \nLilia Ivonne Olvera Cano (lolverac1001@alumno.ipn.mx) 2 , Guadalupe Cleva Villanueva L \u00f3pez 3 , Alfredo Cruz \nOrea 1  \n1 Departamento de F \u00edsica, CINVESTAV -IPN.

The evolution of CKF is uncertain due to \ndifficulties to detect the beginning of renal damage[1]. According to KDIGO (Kidney Disease \nImproving Global Outcomes)[1] criteria, renal damage begins when total albuminuria in 24 h is \nabove 30 mg and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is less than 90 ml/min. [2,3]. Measurement \nof creatinine is indispensable to quantify GFR. The problem is that two different techniques and \nsamples are needed for the determination of albumin and creatini ne[1,2]. It is necessary to \nimplement a technology able to determine the levels of both substances in the same sample, \nwhich could reduce the time to collect the sample and will increase the precision in the \nevaluation of renal function. Photoacoustic spec troscopy (PAS) is a non -destructive technology \nthat allows the determination of different substances in a 60 \u03bcl sample[4,5]. The goal of the \nstudy was to establish standards curves for albumin (0 to 64 mg/dL) and creatinine (0 mg/dL to \n16 mg/dL) by PAS. Ab sorption spectra were detected from 250 to 650 nm. Maximum peaks were \ndetected at 265 nm and 285 nm for albumin and creatinine, respectively. Standard curves were \nbuilt measuring five times each of the 5 concentrations of albumin or creatinine. There was a  \npositive correlation (maximum peak vs concentration) for albumin (R=0.9762, p=0.0004) and \ncreatinine (R=1.0, p<0.0001). It is concluded that PAS is a suitable technology for the \nmeasurement of albumin and creatinine. The results open a possibility of appl ying an innovative \ntechnology for the evaluation of renal damage in patients with high risk of suffering acute or \nchronic renal failure.  \nKeywords : Kidney failure, Albumin, Creatinine, Photoacoustic spectroscopy  \nAuthor for correspondence : lolverac1001@alumno.ipn.mx  \nAcknowledgments : The authors thank E.

The aim of this proyect was to synthes ize and \nfunctionally characterize MIPs for the local release of ciprofloxacin (CPX). 6  MIPs and 6  NIPs \n(without CPX) were synthesized by non -covalent methods using CPX as antibiotic and two \ndifferent monomers (lactic acid LA and methacrylic acid MA); they were characterized by \nscanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and adsorption isotherms. In addition, the \nin vitro release kinetics were evaluated using a Franz cell apparatus, the cytotoxic effect against \nfibroblasts using alamarBlue and the mi nimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was obtained in \nan ATCC strain of Escherichia coli . In micrographs the MIPs are observed with irregular and \nspherical morphologies. ATR -FTIR showed the presence of CPX, in the MIPs, with bands of higher \nintensity in str etching vibrations of the C=O, C=C, C -F and COO - groups. The interactions \nbetween monomer and CPX are given by hydrogen bonds ( -COOH, -NH). The MIP performed \nwith LA was adjusted to the Freundlich model, where adsorption occurs in multilayer, and that \nof M A to the Langmuir model, with adsorption in monolayer. The release kinetics for each of the \npolymers were performed from 0 to 24h, obtaining a first order best fit model, indicating that \nthe drug release is due to a non -Fickian or anomalous diffusion mecha nism, the release profile \nwas above the MIC, which was verified by an assay in E. coli  and finally, the MIPs did not present \ncytotoxicity in fibroblasts during the first 72h of exposure.  \nKeywords:  Molecular Imprinted polymer, drug delivery.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  vannegalvan@hotmail.com  \nThis work was supported by:  Proyecto Fosec sep -investigacion b\u00e1sica 2017 -2018 con n\u00famero \nA1-S-28176: S\u00edntesis y evaluaci\u00f3n de pol\u00edmeros de impresi\u00f3n molecular para la determinaci\u00f3n \nanal\u00edtica de contaminantes emergent es en matrices ambientales.  \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n32  \n \n[ BIO -38 ] Electrical response of Laser -Induced Graphene (LIG) \nin the presence of biological entities.  \nJose Daniel Custodio -Diego (jcustodiod1100@alumno.ipn.mx) 1 , Ram \u00f3n G\u00f3mez-Aguilar 2 , Gerardo \nOrtega -Cervantez 1 , Jaime Ortiz -L\u00f3pez 1  \n1 ESCUELA SUPERIOR DE F \u00cdSICA Y MATEM \u00c1TICAS del INSTITUTO POLIT \u00c9CNICO NACIONAL, Avenida \nInstituto Polit \u00e9cnico Nacional s/n Edificio 9 Unidad Profesional, Adolfo  L\u00f3pez Mateos .

In the last decade, the use of \ngraphene has been chosen as a base material for the design of electronic devices such as \ntransistors and sensors due to its electrical properties, its two -dimensional structure and as an \nadherent to biological entities, although the way it is obtained has made its commercial use \ndifficult. Laser -Induced Graphene (LIG) has become an ideal candidate for the development of \nlow cost and more efficient el ectronic devices. In the present work, from photothermal \nprocesses using CO 2 laser irradiation, polyamide films (Kapton) are converted into ultra -thin and \nporous sheets of Graphene. Carrying out a variation in the power of laser irradiation and making \nan a nalysis of the surface electrical properties of deposits of biological entities on the substrates \nof Laser -Induced Graphene, using the 4 -point resistivity technique, a polynomial relationship is \nobtained between the irradiated power and the surface resisti vity of the LIG, in order to obtain \na quantifiable behavior given the electrical response of the LIG in the presence of biological \nentities.  \nKeywords:  Graphene, laser, irradiation, resistivity, biological.  \nAcknowledgments : This work was supported by Instit uto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional (IPN), Secretar\u00eda \nde Investigaci\u00f3n y Posgrado (SIP) through project numbers 20221310 & 20221437.

By both methods; phase transformation and solvent casting. \nThe film prepared by phase transformation method was annealed at 90, 1 00, and 150 \u00b0C, during \n5 hours at each temperature. Whereas in the preparation of the film by solvent casting method, \nthe solvent evaporation rate was controlled at 0.04 MPa of vacuum pressure for 14 days.  From \nX-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis of the film treated at different temperatures, the \u03b3 and \u03b2 phases \nwere identified coexisting between 90 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C. While, at the annealing temperature of 150 \n\u00b0C, the presence of \u03b1 and \u03b3 phases was identified. On the other hand, it was observed that the \nlow solvent  evaporation rate favored formation of \u03b2 phase at room temperature. Therefore, the \nresults show that \u03b2 phase can be produced by both methods. However, the solvent casting \nmethod presents better conditions for its production.  \nKeywords:  DMSO, phase transform ation, PVDF, solvent casting, XRD  \nAuthor for correspondence:  dmejiad1500@alumno.ipn.mx  \nReference:  S.

The \u03b3-Fe2O3@shell (PMQ) \nwas obtained by synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) by chemical co -precipitation and \ncovering it through layer -by-layer (LbL) technique with two different systems of polyelectrolytes: \n(i) cationic polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) and anionic polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) as a \nsynthetic system, and (ii) cationic chitosan (CHI) and anionic carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as a \nbiopolymer (natural) system. Before using the layer -by-layer technique, quercetin with a \nnegative charge was added to the cationic polyelectrolyte (PAH or CHI) solution, leading to the \nformation of a positively charged complex. The nanoparticle size, morphology, and the \nstructural, optical, and magnetic properties of the systems were analyzed by DLS, TEM, XRD, \nFTIR, and v ibrating sample magnetometer, respectively. Otherwise, the experimental results of \nTGA and \u03b6-potential suggest that the layer -by-layer technique is a feasible way to encapsulate \nquercetin with high efficiency: 64.7% in the PSS/PAH (synthetic polyelectrolyt es) and 87.7% in \nthe CMC/CHI (natural polyelectrolytes). The MNPs@PSS/PAH and MNPs@CMC/CHI systems \nshowed no cytotoxicity; however, when quercetin was loaded into  the system, we have observed \na statistically signi ficant reduction in the viability of the hu man ovarian carcinoma cell line \n(A2780), though their cytotoxicity was less efficient compared with the high cytotoxicity showed \nwith the quercetin alone. Our results indicated that the reduction in cell viability depends on the \nnumber of layers of polyele ctrolytes.

The synthe sis was carried \nout by 3 different polymerization methods which were: mass, coprecipitation and emulsion, \nusing sodium methacrylate as a functional monomer, bisphenol A as a template molecule, \nethylene glycol dimethylacrylate (EDGMA) as a cross -linking age nt, azobisisobutironitrile (AIBN) \nas initiator, and methanol and toluene as porogens. The retention capacity of the MIPs was \nevaluated using a concentration of 1 mg L -1 of BPA, demonstrating a retention capacity greater \nthan 90% for the 3 synthesis methods . The MIPs were characterized through scanning electron \nmicroscopy, finding agglomerated and spherical pellet morphologies with a size range of \nbetween 80 and 100 nm. The nature of the external net load of the MIPs was analyzed where it \nwas determined that  the zero charge pH is 3.8; above this value the surface was negatively \ncharged and below this value it will be positively charged. Through the study of adsorption \nisotherms, it was determined that this adsorption phenomenon was carried out in monolayer, \nwhere all the sites on the surface have the same probability of being occupied and that there is \nno interaction between adsorbed molecules. Similarly, the capacity of MIPs as an adjuvant in the \nprocess of degradation of BPA by O3/UV was determined, where it  was demonstrated that MIPs \nhave a high capacity for adsorption of BPA metabolites at a neutral pH and using 10 mg of \npolymer.  \nKeywords: Molecular Imprinting Polymer, Bisphenol A,  Wastewater treatment  \nAuthor for correspondence:  fernxndo.salazar@gmail.com  \nThis work was supported by  Proyecto fosec sep -investigacion b\u00e1sica 2017 -2018 con n\u00famero \nA1-S-28176: S\u00edntesis y evaluaci\u00f3n de pol\u00edmeros de impresi\u00f3n molecular para la determinaci\u00f3n \nanal\u00edtica de contaminantes emergentes en matrices ambientales.  \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n36  \n \n[ BIO -68 ] Nanocomposites based on polysulfone/carbon black \nfor use in hemodialysis filters  \nBrenda Nayeli Rosales Guzm \u00e1n 3 , Marlene Lariza Andrade Guel 2 , Christian Javier Cabello Alvarado \n(christian.cabello@ciqa.edu.mx) 1 , Carlos Alberto \u00c1vila Orta 2 , Pamela Ya jaira Reyes Rodr \u00edguez 2 , \nJes\u00fas Gilberto Rodr \u00edguez Vel \u00e1zquez 4  \n1 CONACYT -Materiales Avanzados, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  en Qu \u00edmica Aplicada, Blvd. \nSaltillo,Coahuila, 25294, M \u00e9xico \n2 Materiales Avanzados, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  en Qu \u00edmica Aplicada, Blvd. Saltillo, Coahuila,25294, \nM\u00e9xico.  \n3 Nanotecnolog \u00eda, Universidad Tecnol \u00f3gica Emiliano Zapata, Av.

These fibers have diameters ranging from sub microns to nanometers, dimensions \nwhere the material can achieve unique characteristics, such as a large surface area in relation \nto their volume (in the case of nanofibers is 1013 times more than a microfiber), high flexibility, \nhigh porosity, surface flexibility, and high mechanical stre ngth compared to other forms of the \nmaterial. Thus, nanofibers (NFs) are highly attractive for different uses, including special \nmembranes, filtration media, tissue engineering, and  medical applications, among others. The \nexcessive use of polymer container s for food storage has generated a large amount of these \nwastes, so a second use is an important issue.

The ma rigold extract was obtained by \ninfusion with the flower petals, the extract was used as a healing agent and skin regenerator, the chitosan \nwas acquired commercially and a chitosan dressing those functions as a scaffold to protect and integrate \nthe active m aterials. Different tests were performed on the different materials, including crystalline \nstructure, morphology and chemical composition, using UV -Vis spectra, XRD, SEM, EDS, TEM, as well as \nmicrobial and in -vivo tests. In -vivo tests were performed on 2 p atients of advanced age, morbid obesity, \ntype 2 diabetes and high risk of amputation (who gave their full consent to perform the treatment). By \nmeans of electronic microscopy it was observed that the nanoparticles not only presented a single \nspherical morp hology but also presented cubic, pyramid and thread morphology, while in -vivo tests \nshowed a complete recovery of the ulcer in a period of 2 to 4 months respectively in the patients.   \nKeywords : Chitosan, Nanoparticles, Clinical case, Diabetes, Wounds   \nAuth ors for correspondence : Erika Fabiola Hernandez Elizarraras - kika.faby@live.com   \nReference :  Borgnakke, W., 2021.

Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is one of the most \nwidely used polymers in these composite materials, due to its piezoelectric property, generated \nby the different crystalline structures formed i n the polymer, such as the alpha phase ( \u03b1 ) , \ngamma phase and the beta phase ( \u03b2), which is the phase of interest and is the one with the \nmaximum net dipole. The present work focuses on the manufacturing process of PVDF films \nbased on the synthesis of the p olymer using different types of solvents, \nhexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) and dimethylformamide (DMF) over different conditions of \npressure and temperature, with the objective to obtain the \u03b2 phase.

A route to improve the corrosion and wear resistance is to use a surface \ntreatment, such as the one provided by the plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO). This technique \nis used to apply ceramic coatings on light metals, and it is widely  applied in biomedical area.  \nBased on the above, in this work we carried out a study in order to improve the corrosion \nresistance of the AZ31 Mg alloy by applying TiO 2-based coatings through the PEO technique. \nAnatase -TiO 2 powders were incorporated into th e electrolytic solution due to their good \nbiocompatibility. Coatings were developed by varying the TiO 2 concentration from 0.08 g to 0.18 \ng, and the current density from 260 to 300 mA/cm2. The distance between electrodes was set to \n2 cm and the pH was 11.9 . \nThe presence of TiO 2 in the coatings was confirmed by optical reflectance tests. Surface \nmorphology and chemical composition were studied by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). \nSEM images at 500x magnification showed that TiO 2-based coatings have formed a porose \nsurface. The porosity increases as density current increases. The open -circuit potential (OCP), \nelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization curves (Tafel) \nwere employed to investigate the corrosion resistan ce of the AZ31 substrate with and without \ncoatings in Hanks\u2019 balanced salts. Preliminary results show that  Icorr is reduced in one order of \nmagnitude when a TiO 2-based coatings were used, indicating an improve on the corrosion \nresistance.  \nResults demonstra te that the process developed in this work can be applied to improve \ncorrosion resistance of Mg and its alloys to expand their applications.  \nThis work has been supported by  Universidad de Guanajuato (Convocatoria Institucional de \nInvestigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica 2 022).

Its manifestation in low -risk persons may present mainly as cold, dyspnea, \nfever, and fatigue. However, people over 60 years old or people with comorbid conditions such \nas hypertension, diabetes, and excess visceral fat, among others, may present severe symptoms \nincluding multi -organ failure, acute cardiac injury, and the development of severe acute \nrespiratory syndrome (SARS), which can lead to death in a matter of days. In this regard, the \ndevelopmen t of a highly sensitive diagnostic in the early days and accurate detection of COVID -\n19 is vital. During this work, under the context of prevention, identification, and accurate \ndiagnosis of SARS -CoV-2 and COVID -19, a biosensor based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) \nsupported on graphene oxide (GO) functionalized with an antibody against the Spike protein of \nSARS -CoV-2 is developed. The Au -NPs are synthesized by photodeposition on graphene oxide \nsheets, afterwards, the nanocomposites (AuNPs -GO) are characteriz ed by UV -Vis spectroscopy, \nFTIR, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy. The conjugation of AuNPs -GO with the IgG antibody \nspecific for Spike protein is evaluated through UV -Vis spectroscopy. Finally, the AuNPs -GO-IgG \nsystem is evaluated in the detection of SARS -CoV-2 using virus -like particles (VLPs) that contain \nthe Spike protein as a resemblance of the virus SARS -CoV-2. The VLPs are detected at very low \nconcentrations by analyzing the variation in the UV -Vis spectrum of AuNPs -GO by the specific \nbinding  of the VLPs with the AuNPs -GO-IgG biosensor.  \nKeywords:  virus -like particles (VLPs), gold nanoparticles, SARS -CoV-2, graphene oxide.  \nCorrespondence author:  Selene Acosta, selene.acosta@ipicyt.edu.mx.  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n47  \n \n[ BIO -261 ]  Depolymerized chitosan as a vehicle for the \nincorporation and release of anticancer active ingredients  \nAlejandra Estefania Herrera Alonso (alejandra.herrera@cimav.edu.mx) 1 , Alberto Toxqui Ter \u00e1n 1 , \nMargarita S \u00e1nchez Dom \u00ednguez 1  \n1 Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  en Materiales Avanzados S.C.

Chitosan is a biodegradable and biocompatible polysaccharide, \ncurrently being invest igated as a drug delivery vehicle. With lower values of molecular weight in \nchitosan, the appropriate particle sizes can be achieved to circulate in the body to reach the \ntumor site. Therefore, in this study the depolymerization of chitosan and the effect of \nincorporating and encapsulating curcumin, a natural phytochemical with antioxidant properties, \nis carried out. Starting from low molecular weight commercial grade chitosan and through \noxidative degradation with NaNO 2, depolymerization is carried out by modifying the reaction \ntime. The samples are characterized by Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR -ATR) to demonstrate that \nthere are no changes in the structure of chitosan when depolymerizing, in addition to estimating \nthe percentages of the degree of deacetylati on of the samples, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) \nand differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as indicative of the decrease in molecular weight due \nto weight drops at lower temperatures, indicating lower thermal stability. Subsequently, the \nfragmented sa mples are crosslinked with the aim of achieving higher percentages of curcumin \nincorporation and increasing the release time, indicating that the crosslinking agent has an \neffect on the incorporation of the drug in the material and on the release kinetics.  \nKeywords:  Chitosan, depolymerization, curcumin  \nCorrespondence author:  alejandra.herrera@cimav.edu.mx  \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n48  \n \n[ BIO -201 ]  DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A \nCOLLAGEN/CHITOSAN NANOFIBER MEMBRANE FOR DELIVERY \nOF TRANEXAMIC ACID  \nTonantzin  P\u00e9rez Moreno (tonantzi.n.01269@gmail.com) 1 , Eduardo Arturo Elizalde Pe \u00f1a 1  \n1 facultad  de Ingenier \u00eda, Universidad Aut \u00f3noma de Quer \u00e9taro, Quer \u00e9taro.

Tel\u00e9fono: 57296000,  \nIn the last decade, a prominent rise in diabetic patients has been noted, according to the \nInternational Diabetes Federation (IDF), it is estimated that 14 million adults in Mexico live with \ndiabetes, which represents an increase of 10% in the last two yea rs. In order for patients to have \nbetter control of their disease, a non -invasive device for glucose sensing through sweat is \nproposed, using an ISFET (Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor) transistor for the detection of \ndifferent concentrations (1, 2 , 4, 6 and 8 MM) of glucose. The ISFET transistor has a thin film \narchitecture with the following material arrangement LIG/ITO/PDMS/P3HT/ITO. The sensing \nmechanism consists of depositing the different concentrations of glucose on the laser -induced \ngraphene b ioplatform, LIG (Gate contact), which will cause a change in the electrical resistance \nof the Gate, due to the latter, the gate voltage will be modulated, reflecting in a horizontal shift \nof the transferential response of the transistor compared to the tra nsferential curve of the \ntransistor without glucose in the device. Using this technique, it has been possible to appreciate \ncurrent changes ranging from 1\u00b5A to 8\u00b5A with respect to the reference transistor signal. With \nthis, we can conclude that this census  technique is an auxiliary for monitoring glucose levels in \nlow concentrations.  \nKeywords: Sensor, ISFET, Glucose, LIG, Bioplatform  \nReference : Martinoia, S., Massobrio, G., & Lorenzelli, L.

The aim of \nthis work was measured the physical properties of hybrid coatings synthesized by sol -gel (hybrid \nsystem was SiO 2-unsaturated polyester resin from recycled polyethylene terephthalate, SiO 2- \nR_UPR). Methodology to elaborate the hybrid solution consisted in three alternated steps: 1) \nSynthesis of a SiO 2 solution by sol -gel from tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS).  2) Mechanical \nrecycling of bottles of PET postconsumer to obtain PET flakes (1 cm2) and chemical recycling of \nthem (depolymerization by glycolysis) using propylene glycol and zinc acetate (ZnA) as  catalyst, \nin a Vessel -type reactor (20 -200 \u00b0C), to obtain bis(2 -hydroxypropyl -terephthalate), then it was \nreacted with maleic anhydride to produce unsaturated polyester (UP) and then, was mixed with \nstyrene (St) to obtain R_UPR. 3) Synthesis of hybrid sol ution (SiO 2- R_UPR) was synthesized by \nsol-gel at different molar ratios, R_UPR:TEOS:3 -trimethoxysilylpropyl methacrylate (TMSPM), of \n0:1:0 (T), 1:2:0.25 (HS1), 1:1:0.25 (HS2) and 1:0:0.25 (HS3),  and from them hybrid coatings (HC) \nwere made by dip coating . Molecular bonds in HS were identified by FT -IR and the physical \nproperties of HC were measured by AFM (roughness), ASTM D -3359 (adherence), wettability \n(contact angle) and SEM (thickness). The coatings showed good physical properties, they were \nadhered p erfectly to the substrate, with thicknesses of micrometer units, and flat surface \n(roughness average less than 1 nm), and hydrophilicity decreased as SiO 2 amount decreased \n(contact angle increased from 52\u00b0 to 73\u00b0).  \nKeywords: Hybrid -coating; recycled PET; u nsaturated polyester resin; SiO2; sol -gel process  \nAuthor for correspondence : J.L.

Due to this, great developments \nhave arisen in medicine, biotechnology, etc. One of the most important applications is the use \nof nanoparticles as carrier vehicles for the controlled release of drugs to improve stability, \nsolubility and biodistribution. However, the effect o f carbon spheres (CSs) on the phytohormonal \nactivity of plant growth -promoting endophytic bacteria to enhance plant growth is little known. \nThe objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of CSs at different concentrations \nwith  Bacillus thuringiensis  and Micromonospora echinospora  on germination of  Prosopis \nglandulosa . The CSs were synthesized from rosin by the chemical vapor deposition method, then \ndispersed in a detergent solution and treated  P. glandulosa  seeds inoculated with the bacteria \nand sown  in soil. The only response variable was germination percentage, experimental data \nwere analyzed by ANOVA -Tukey (P \u2264 0.05). The results indicated a positive effect on  P. \nglandulosa  seeds with  B. thuringiensis  and M. echinospora   and presence of CSs, which registered \n82% germination, a value statistically different from the 55% germination of  P. \nglandulosa  without CSs and bacteria fed. These facts support that the positive effect on seed \ngermination was due to the hydrolysis of starch wich was reactivated wh en water was soaked, \nreleasing organic compounds, which  B. thuringiensis  and M. echinospora  transformed into \nphytohormones, which, potentiated with the CSs, stimulated a greater emergence of  P. \nglandulosa  seeds.   \nKeywords:  carbon spheres,  endophytic bacter ia, phytohormonal activity, nanomaterial   \nAuthor for correspondence:  ladamex@yahoo.es  This work was supported by  CIC of UMSNH \nand CONACYT  \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n55  \n \n[ BIO -66 ] THERMAL DIFFUSIVITY OF CHITOSAN -BIOACTIVE \nAGENTS EDIBLE NANOCOATINGS FOR HORTICULTURAL \nPRODUCTS PRESERVATION  \nZormy Nacary Correa -Pacheco (zcorreap@ipn.mx) 1 , Jos\u00e9 Luis Jim \u00e9nez-P\u00e9rez 3 , Alfredo Cruz -Orea 2 , \nMar\u00eda Luisa Corona -Rangel 1 , Silvia Bautista -Ba\u00f1os 1  \n1 Centro de Desarrollo de Productos Bi \u00f3ticos, Instituto Polit \u00e9cnico Nacional, Carretera Yautepec -\nJojutla km 6, San Isidro, Yautepec, Morelos 62731, Mexico  \n2 Departamento de F \u00edsica, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  y de Estudios Avanzados del Inst ituto Polit \u00e9cnico \nNacional, Gustavo A.

They act as \nbarriers to moisture and gas exchange and have antimicrobial activity. They are mainly prepared \nfrom starch and gelatin, am ong other biodegradable polymers. Chitosan is a biodegradable and \nnon-toxic polymer with antimicrobial activity use in edible films that along with bioactive agents \nlike essential oils and propolis can be used as coating for horticultural products. Moreove r, \nchitosan can be added in the form of nanoparticles to increase its antimicrobial and thermal \nactivity due to the higher surface area to volume ratio. On the other hand, edible films \ncharacterization is mainly based on physicochemical properties; however , thermal properties \nare still unexplored. In this work, edible films from a polymer matrix based on chitosan added \nwith chitosan nanoparticles (CS) and chitosan added thyme essential oil (CS -EO) or chitosan \nadded propolis (CS -P) were prepared using the na noprecipitation method. Thermal diffusivity \n(D) of casting films was measured by the open photoacoustic cell technique at room \ntemperature. From the results, the highest value of D was for the CS -EO (1.9\u00b10.04 x 10-6 m2/s) \nfollowed by the CS (1.4\u00b10.02 x 10-6 m2/s) and CS -P films (1.1\u00b10.01 x 10-6 m2/s) films, although \nvalues were similar. Therefore, for use in the preservation of horticultural products, the heat \ntransfer through the edible films at room temperature is not a parameter influenced by the type \nof nanoparticles. Moreover, films showed lower t hermal diffusivity due to the thermal properties \nof the polymer matrix used. It has been reported that chitosan confers thermal stability to \ncomposite films related to its structure and in the films due to the presence of agglomerations \nand degree of cryst allinity [1]. Further studies are necessary to stablish these structure -\nproperties relationship.  \n1. Polysaccharides Bioactivity and Biotechnology. 2015. K.

This is because the samples will be employed in synchrotron studies \nto learn about the physical origin of the Shirley background in photoemission spectra, and the \npresence of various s pecies dramatically complicates the analysis. In previous studies using \nthermal oxidation of pure iron ultrathin films, we found that, as expected, Fe 2O3 is the easiest to \nobtain and most stable oxide. However, a small amount of suboxide (Fe 3O4) and pure m etallic \niron remains at low -temperature annealing, while higher -temperature annealing provokes a \nchemical reaction with silicon and the formation of protrusions. Here, it is proposed to overcome \nthis problem by growing full hematite nanofilms on silicon us ing electrochemical deposition. \nThis technique offers a facile synthesis route for controlling film thickness, large -area uniformity, \nand the possibility for room temperature deposition.

X-ray diffraction patterns show two types of \ndiffractograms. One type is related to crystalline phase and the other type to amorphous phase \nwith crystals embedded in the glassy matrix. Scanning electron microscopy detects the \nformation of hexagonal -shaped crys tals that could be related to Cr 2O3. The optical band gap of \nthe glass samples was determined by optical absorption spectroscopy using the Tauc method.  \nA TeO 4 groups transformation (trigonal bipyramids) to TeO 3 groups (trigonal pyramids) is \nobserved.

These variations allow the formation of bridge bonds of the Te ax-Oec-Te type \nthat, because of CrO 3, form non -bridging oxygens.  \nReferences : [1] Alvarado Rivera, J., P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez, C.

This work presents 3 d X-ray photoelectron \nspectra from pure elements ranging from Sr(Z=38) to Te(Z=52). These were analyzed using the \nDoubl \u00e9Lorentzian lineshape to account for the asymmetry of the main photoemission line, the \nbranching ratio was forced to the theoretically expected value from the Scofield tables. It was \npossible to quantify the modulation with Z of the asymmetry of the 3 d3/2 and 3 d5/2 main peaks. \nIt is remarkable that, for elements with completely filled 4 d orbitals, the Double -Lorentzian \nasymmetry tends to be roughly equal between the two 3 d branches. The background was \nmodeled as a combination of a Shirley -type background, SVSC, a baseline, and, in some cases, a \nSlope background. The Shirley parameter decreases from a high value for Sr to a local minimum \nfor Mo, to a local maximum for Rh.

Moreover, graphene has become the most promising two -dimensional \n(2D) material for several applications comprising electronics, optoelectronics, energy storage, \nenergy harvesting, among others. Graphene prope rties are related to its structure, crystallinity \nand oxidation degree. In this work, graphene oxide (GO) samples were prepared at different \noxidation degrees using a modified Hummers\u2019 method. The degree of oxidation is directly \nrelated to the C/O atomic r atio based on the carbon and oxygen contents. The C/O ratio of GO, \nrGO and SOG was calculated to be ~2, >80, 4 -5, respectively. The samples were suspended by \ndrop casting on membranes with an array of circular holes. The mechanical response of these \nfree-suspended few layers of GO with different oxidation degree were evaluated by classical \nforce \u2013 displacement curve indentations using an MFP3D -SA AFM.

In molybdenum oxid es there \nhave been extensive reports on the synthesis of MoO x in multi dimensions, to mention a few \nzero dimensional, quantum dots, nanosheets, and 3D materials. The properties decide the \nstructures and therefore their applications such as use for photodev ices, energy storage, drug \ndelivery, ion batteries, and gas sensors, among others. Molybdenum oxide (MoO 3) is a relatively \ninexpensive semiconductor material, n -type semiconductor and can be used as a catalyst, solid \nlubricant, electrochromic applications,  etc. It has been demonstrate that different synthesis \nmethods at different conditions result in nanowires of different structure. For example, \nmicrowave -assited hydrothermal synthesis results in hexagonal nanowires while conventional \nhydrothermal results in nanobelts. It is worth to mention that in conventional hydrothermal \nsynthesis the usage of acidifying agents results on thinner and longer for HNO 3 and shorter and \nirregular belts for HCl. In this work, molybdenum oxide nanowires were synthetized by che mical \nattack and thermal treatment. First, a commercially obtained Mo foil (99 % purity) was \nmechanically polished until a mirror -surface was obtained, then ultrasonically clean in milli Q \nwater. The obtained polished foil was then deposit in HCl at differ ent concentrations (10 M, 5 M, \n2 M and 0.5 M) for 3 minutes and then dried at room temperature. The MoOx foil is then taken \nfor thermal treatment at different temperatures (600 \u00b0C and 700 \u00b0C) and time exploration (1, 3 \nand 5 h) was conducted. XRD confirms MoO 3 orthorhombic structures in the obtained substrate \nthat shows growth of certain crystalline planes and decrease in others due to changes on the \ncrystallinity. Morphology characterization by SEM and TEM analysis demonstrates the obtained \nnanowires array  and the changes in the morphology form irregular nanowires at lower \ntemperatures to well defined and longer nanostructures at higher temperatures making the \nbasis for the optimal conditions for MoO 3 nanowires array synthesis. The effect of chemical \netchin g on the surface properties of MoO 3 structures is discussed.  \nKeywords: MoO 3 nanowires, thermal treatment, chemical attack.  \nCorresponding Author:  fernando.vazquezv@cinvestav.mx  \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n64  \n \n[ CHM -348 ]  NANOMATERIALS AND BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES PREPARATION \nFOR CHARACTERIZATION WITH TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY \n(TEM)  \nGabriela Guzman Navarro (gguzman@cicese.mx) 2 , Ernestina Castro Longoria 1 , Rosa Mouri \u00f1o P\u00e9rez \n1  \n1 Departamento de Microbiolog \u00eda Experime ntal, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  Cient \u00edfica y de Educaci \u00f3n \nSuperior de Ensenada (CICESE), Carretera Ensenada - Tijuana No. 3918, Zona Playitas, CP. 22860, \nEnsenada, B.C., M \u00e9xico \n2 Laboratorio Nacional de Microscopia Avanzada (LNMA),Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  Cient\u00edfica y de \nEducaci \u00f3n Superior de Ensenada (CICESE), Carretera Ensenada - Tijuana No. 3918, Zona Playitas, CP. \n22860, Ensenada, B.C., M \u00e9xico \nThe development of science and technology require techniques for following up the progress \nand conclusion of projects. The study of nanomaterials with properties attributed to size and \nshape is increasing. Therefore, characterization techniques that have the required resolution to \nobserve and interpret the properties of nanomaterials are needed. Due  to the nano scale, the \nuse of transmission electron microscopes (TEM) with high resolution have become \nindispensable and, in some cases, special sample preparation is needed. TEM allow us to study \nthe morphology, crystallinity, surface details, and more o f nanomaterials, to the point of \nbecoming a rutinary characterization technique. In this work we present the versatility of the \ncharacterization and support that TEM can offer. We show the images acquired and the \npreparation protocols from a variety of sam ples that were used to complete and publish the \nwork of several projects. The idea is to generate confidence in the results that can be endorsed \nusing this technique. The presented examples include monitoring the size and shape of \nnanoparticles during the synthesis process using green methods. Monitoring viral nanoparticles \nduring the encapsulation of drugs and the changes produced by using different buffers to see \ntheir stability for application in medicine and agriculture. Also, in cytotoxic studies it is  necessary \nto determine nanoparticles internalization to see how deep they penetrate in cells. Additionally, \nit becomes important to let know users, that organic samples (nanogels, cells, virus, bacteria, \nand fungi) need special preparation protocols becau se the technique involves high vacuum and \nhigh energy impact of electrons on samples, that are important features to consider when \nworking with organic or responsive materials. Nonetheless, there are several projects in all levels \nthat can be highly benefi ciated by TEM.  \nKeywords: TEM, electron microscopy, nanomaterials, characterization, biological sample \npreparation.  \nAuthor for correspondence: gguzman@cicese.mx* \nThis work was supported by : Ciencia B\u00e1sica -CONACYT No. Proyecto 281977.

These works, which were especially focused on \nthe accurate fitting of complex structures of the 2p photoelectron spectra of the 4th period \ntransition metals, also showed the need to use physical paramete rs in the fitting process, \nadequate line shapes, the consideration of both photoemission lines, and especially a proper \nmodeling of the background.   The reports also showed the robustness of the proposed fits by \nsuccessfully assessing the chemical composit ion.  For the special case of the Cu2p photoelectron \nspectra, there is no direct way to differentiate between the signal contribution of Cu0 and Cu1+ \nsince the shape of the spectra are almost identical. Some works use the Auger parameter to \ndetermine this difference in chemical species, however, in thin films, the shape and the Auger \nparameter cannot properly be used, because as it happens in the Cu2p spectra, the Cu1+ Auger \nsignal is also identical to metallic copper Auger signal.   Ultra -pure copper films were deposited \nby sublimation in ultrahigh vacuum, which guaranteed films were free of carbon and \noxygen.   Subsequently, exposures were made in a controlled atmosphere of ultra -pure oxygen \nfor 10, 100, 1000 and 10,000  mega Langmuir (ML), obtaining high -resolution spectra of Cu for \nthe first stages of oxidation.   For the spectrum of metallic copper, it was possible to assess the \nLorentzian width of both branches as a function of oxygen exposure.   We found that, while the \nwidth of the 3/2 branch is the same f or the Cu0 and Cu1+ cases, the Lorentzian width of the 1/2 \nbranch evolves from 1.34 eV (for Cu0) to 1.01 eV for Cu1+.   This modulation allows, employing \nXPS data, for the quantification of the Cu1+ when both Cu0 and Cu1+ are present.  \nThis work was partiall y financed by  Proyecto Fronteras 58518, Conacyt, Mexico.  \n1.

C.P. 04510, M \u00e9xico \nIn sputtering deposition systems, several factors are commonly varied in order to be produce a \ncoating or  thin film, such as working gas, reactive gas, DC/RF power and even in some cases \nheating of the substrate to obtain a certain crystallinity or biasing of the substrate to improve \ncertain properties of the deposited materials. Some characteristics of the s puttering techniques \nare usually left for granted, as for example, the intensity or shape of the magnetic field of the \nmagnetron, or the cathode/target temperature as \u201croom temperature\u201d. The latter is not entirely \na stable or constant during most of the sp uttering processes, and in most cases, this can greatly \naffect the physical and chemical surface properties of the cathode/target and the resulting film. \nFurthermore, if a reactive atmosphere is used, the bombardment of excited species towards the \ncathode/ target, will increase its temperature, and for higher powers this may rise significantly \nup to a point that can induce chemical reactions, thus changing the electric properties and also \nthe sputtering yield.  \nIn this work we present the results of studies o f the photothermic emission in the infrared (IR) \nof several commonly used sputtering targets: Ti, Ti -O, Al, Al -O, Cr, Ag, graphite, Si and Si -O; via \nthermal imaging using an IR camera.

Composites formed by cis -1,4-polyisoprene, as matrix, and carbon nanostructures, as \nfiller, without the use of vulcanize agents were extensive examined. The  Backscattered Electron \nMicroscopy characterization enable to distinguish atoms with different atomic number due to a \nbrightness difference. This technique was used to analyze the sulfur distribution into the \ncomposites due to, according with other spectra l analysis, the linkage contribution between the \npolymer was given by the carbon nanostructures. The sulfur weight percentage in composites \nonly represents the 0.3 % and its dispersion is fundamental to understand the polymer \nmechanic properties improvemen t, as the four times Vickers hardness increment. In order to \nameliorate the sulfur observation through backscattered electron microscopy, a work distance \nbetween 10 and 11 mm was used with a voltage range of 10 to 20 keV. The composite was coated \nwith gold  and carbon, 15 nm thickness, to ensure the high current utilization. The variables \nvoltage, thickness, and materials were simulated to analyze the electron penetration and \nbackscattering coefficient. A better understanding of electron interaction, volume penetration, \nwith the material, entails a more favorable characterization of sulfur distribution within the \ncomposite.   \nKeywords: backscattered electron microscopy, polymer composite,  SEM, carbon nanostructure  \nAuthor for correspondence:  ladamex@yahoo.es  \nThis work was supported by  CIC of UMSNH and CONACYT.   \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n70  \n \n[ CHM -25 ] Thickness dependence of optical \nproperties of silver and aluminum ultrathin films  \nDiego Germain Mejia Gonzalez (germain.mejia@uabc.edu.mx) 1 , Noemi Abundiz Cisneros 1 , Roberto \nSangines de Castro 1 , Roberto Machorro Mej \u00eda 1 , Juan Aguila Mu \u00f1oz 1  \n1 Centro de Nanociencias y Nanotecnolog \u00eda (CNyN) - Universidad Nacional Aut \u00f3noma de M \u00e9xico \n(UNAM)  \nMetal -based transparent films play an important role in modern optoelectronic devices and as \nradiative heat -reflectors in energy saving applications  [1,2,3].

Attenuated \nTotal Reflection (ATR) is one of the most promising techniques for THz spectroscopy because \nthe sample interacts with only the evanescent field, and minimal sample preparation is required. \nTHz-ATR spectroscopy has become a powerful tool in the s tudy of biological samples as well as \nin material science research. For these reasons, it is crucial to ensure a good understanding and \ninterpretation of ATR spectra, especially since the water content of biological samples plays an \nessential role in their  spectral response. This work reports an analytical and numerical \ninterpretation of ATR spectra for highly absorbent liquids. Water in the terahertz range provides \na good case of study, where both the real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive inde x \nincrease with the wavelength to a point where losses are not negligible. Indeed, beyond the low -\nloss limit, the conventional definition of low absorbance, commonly accepted in ATR data \ninterpretation does not apply anymore. Here, we present a systematic study including \nexperimental spectra and finite element method simulations of bulk water and water films \n(thicknesses in the range 0.5 -18 mm) to discuss the physical implications of the analytical model. \nOne of the most important conclusions for the ATR sp ectroscopy community at any frequency \nrange is that the condition for total internal reflection can never be satisfied for highly absorbent \nsamples. However, it is possible to estimate the relevant parameters such as absorption \ncoefficient and penetration depth from the signal retrieved in reflection after the ATR accessory. \nIn conclusion, our results suggest that the community should be aware of the proposed \nanalytical model for interpreting ATR spectra in general and particularly for terahertz \nspectroscop y of biological samples.  \nKeywords: terahertz, ATR, spectroscopy, water  \nThis work was supported by:  LANCYT project number  LN-315926 and CONACYT PhD -\nscholarship   \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n72  \n \n[ CHM -294 ] Measuring non -conductive surface with Contact \nKelvin Probe Force Microscopy  \nFrancisco  J.

The \nchemical precursors for KNN system were K 2CO 3, Na 2CO 3, Nb 2O5 and the dopants were Li 2CO 3, \nLa2O3, TiO 2. The milling was made in a nylamid container with zirconium balls in a relation \nweight: balls 1:10 in an 8000 spex mixer mill for 2.5 hrs. after that the powders were pressed in \ncircular disks and calcined at  800 \u00b0C.

Uv -vis spectroscopy \n(380 -780 nm) showed that the ceramic samples are transparent below the wavelength \ncorresponding to 249 nm, where the samples do not absorb enough energy for electr onic state \ntransitions. The bandgap energy of all samples is in a range of 3.20 -3.02 eV.

The \nsame goes for the 3 d spectra of the fourth row [2] and the 4 f spectra of the fifth row [3] pure \nmetals.   In addition, there are similarities between the behavior, as a function of the column, of \nthe peak and background parameters of these three rows, such as the intensity of the Shirley \nbackground.   The Shirley back ground is largest for the first column (2B), decreases to a local \nminimum then rises again to a local maximum in the seventh column (8B).   The large value of \nthe Shirley background for the first column elements is correlated with the large asymmetry of \nthe main peak and the presence of strong intrinsic plasmons.   This correlation might be due to \na similar physical origin [4]   The local maximum in the 8B column coincides with the maximum \nof permutations of the valence band, as previously pointed out by Castl e and Salvi [5].

Investigations and proposals on the physical foundations as well as the \nreconstruction algorithms can improve the quality of the image. This work aims to present the \nresults obtained with a proposed measurement technique and our reconstruction algorithm for \nphotoacoustic imaging. The proposed experimental technique consists of a homemade \nphotoacoustic tomograph in which both the light source and the dete ctor are fixed, while the \nsample is rotating around a fixed axis. The photoacoustic wave is detected by the acoustic \nsensor in the plane defined by the sample cross section and the height at which the laser light \nstrikes. The acquired electrical signals fo r the different positions of rotation are the entry data \nfor the proposed reconstruction algorithm, which consists of a segmentation of the \nreconstruction sections in the computational grid using the synthetic aperture focusing \ntechnique.

In order to use the longitudinal waves to detect the thickness of two layered -\nsystems, we explore the solutions of a proposed 1D -Cauchy boundary value problem for the LI U \ninhomogeneous wave equation. In the proposed mathematical solution, as well as, in the \nexperimental arrangement, the Aluminum slabs are submerged in water. These samples with \nthree different thicknesses (12, 6, and 3 mm) were exchanged to obtain all the possible \ncombinations for the two -layered systems. In the first layered system, where there is a finite and \na semifinite slab, the distance between the finite sample and the PDVF film sensor is fixed. While \nthe distance between the finite and semifinite sl ab is adjusted for the data sweeping. Meanwhile, \nthe second layered system, has two finite samples in which the distance between one of the \nfinite slabs and the PDVF film sensor is fixed. The other slab is movable so we can vary the gap \namong them and reco llect the data. The 1D -Cauchy boundary value problem for the LIU -\ninhomogeneous wave equation was solved in the frequency domain, considering a 532nm pulse \nlaser with Gaussian finite time -width. The source term in the inhomogeneous wave equation \nwas assumed  to be proportional to the optical energy absorbed by the samples. A comparation \nbetween the experimental and theoretical data provided information about the layer\u2019s \nthicknesses, which suggest that the proposal can be applied to detect sub -superficial defe cts in \nmanufactured objects.  \n[1]      J.

In \n1976, J. A. Dobrowolski et al. [1] used the equation developed by Sossi [2] to  create a \ncomputation algorithm, which proved the potential of the Fourier Transform m ethod for the \nsynthesis  of inhomogeneous filters. Since then, many applications have been proposed, some \nof them made in practical  filters.  According to the Fourier transform theory, there is a \nrelationship between two different domains denoted as  transfor m pairs.  According to the \nFourier transform principles, for the rugate filter synthesis method, more optical thickness (high \nfrequencies) added to the filter, implies finer  details in the desired spectral response \n(transmittance) can be achieved. These are  the fundamental concepts for  the present work and \nthe obtained results.  \nThis work demonstrates that the spectral response of a rugate filter can be improved as more \noptical thickness  is added to the filter, also showing that Fourier theory statements can be \napplied to the rugate filters theory.  The second point of the study is  how thin the rugate filters \ncan be built without compromising the spectral  response, and also maintaining a viable optical \nthickness for experimental growing conditions.  \nAcknowledgments:  PAPIIT  IG101220,  Estudios de los plasmas usados por la t\u00e9cnica de er osi\u00f3n \ni\u00f3nica reactiva con magnetr\u00f3n  (Reactive magnetr\u00f3n sputtering)  \n[1] J.

However, there are many \ncontributions to the photoelectron s pectra of many materials, which are complex with not so \nclearly defined natures, tampering with the quality of the analyses. This issue is far greater \nenhanced when transition metals are present, not allowing for a proper quantitative analysis of \nthe exper imental data. To solve the issue accurate background determination is paramount \nwhere theoretical and empirical approaches have been previously employed, where the \nempirical Shirley background used to reproduce the step -shaped nature of the photoelectron \nbackground remains the most accurate approach. Due to the satisfactory results in quantitation, \nthe so -called empirical Shirley background may also have a physical origin as a previous report \n[1] has shown. Therefore, we present a systematic approach employ ing a well -established peak -\nfitting methodology to assess the Shirley intensity of the 2 p photoemission spectra for the first -\nrow transition metals. The results show that the Shirley background intensity is consistent and \nreproducible over many types of sa mples irrespective of the synthesis method and measuring \nconditions. Outstandingly, our results suggest that the Shirley intensity varies upon increasing \natomic number, which might suggest that the Shirley intensity may be an intrinsic periodic \nproperty of  the atoms. The Shirley intensity appears to be the largest possible when the d-band \nis almost empty or half empty, indicating the Shirley intensity might be related to many possible \nrelaxation channels coupled to the available states in the d-band. Irresp ective of the latter, we \npresent an interesting trend that has not been before analyzed with the present degree of detail.  \n[1] A. Herrera -Gomez, D. Cabrera -German, A.D.

Assessing this \ndependence is a difficult task that requires state -of-the-art fitting methods because the spectra \nshow complex asymmetry shapes, multip let structure, plasmons, and also satellites. Through \nthe use of the empirical double -Lorentzian lineshape, it is an approach to reproduce the \nasymmetry for all the elements (Pt, Au, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi), suggesting that it could bear a fundamental \nbasis.

Post. J -48, Puebla, Pue, \n72570, Mexico  \nRegularly, sol -gel BiFeO 3 films are deposited by nth layers (nL) until they reach a thickness that \nallows characterizing their macroscopic ferroelectric properties. However, the overall \nperformance of the multilayer resulting in a BiFeO 3 film will be largely determined by properti es \nof the first layer, but this has received little attention, even though defects of this layer can \naccumulate as the number of layers increases. Defects as cracks, leakage currents, or \nmorphological may depend on the sol -gel synthesis method and can be e xamined in advance \nfrom the first layer. Here, we perform and electrical and ferroelectric study of one layer (1L) dip -\ncoating sol -gel BiFeO 3 films throught two of the main reported sol -gel solutions that give rise to \nwell-defined ferroelectric -loops when they are deposited with nL. The main variation in the two \nidentified routes is the dissolvent, the first route being based on the toxic 2-methoxyethanol  (ME), \nand the second one on the relative safe acetic acid  (AA) with some 2 -methoxyethanol.  We perform \nthe study at the nanoscale using advanced atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques to identify \nthe fine features or defects of the 1L BiFeO 3 films. Our results reveal the occurrence of a \ndielectric breakdown at lower voltage for the ME films than for AA films, which agree with the \nobserved in the conductive maps. The piezoelectric coefficient for ME films was found to be 20% \nhigher than for AA films. Both deposition methods give ferroelectric films with an \nelectromechanical strain  controlled by the piezoelectric effect, while that of electrostriction one \nwas minimal. An optimization for AA route in one of the deposition parameters, namely the \nimmersion speed, results in a significant reduction of the dielectric breakdown and a more  than \ntwofold increase in the piezoelectric coefficient. Our results broaden the understanding of \nelectric and piezoelectric behavior of 1L BiFeO 3 films.  \nKeywords: Perovskite films, BiFeO 3, PFM.  \nAuthor of correspondence:  carolina.diliegros@correo.buap.mx  \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n82  \n \n[ CHM -315 ] XPSOasis: the XPS Peak -Fitting Network  \nAlberto Herrera -Gomez (aherrerag@cinvestav.mx) 1 , Daniel Herrera -Rendon (hhefesto@rdataa.com) \n2 , Enrique Aguilar -Diaz 2  \n1 Cinvestav -Unidad Queretaro  \n2 RDataA  \nThe XPSOasis Web platform (https://xpsoasis.org/) aims to make available to the XPS \ncommunity, free of charge, tools that facilitate communication between XPS users; this includes \ndiscussion forums and peak -fitting databases (one for each core -level), dynamic communication \nbetween users, and free data analysis software.

In particular, the production \nof second -generation biofuels obtained from organic material not used by the agroindustry is \nan area of opportunity for new development and research. In the production of biofuels, the \nideal raw material is reducing sugars, corresponding to the energy storage of plants. Currently, \nthe conversion into bioethanol from the leaves of Agave tequilana is being studied.The objective \nof the present work is to characte rize the pH -dependent fluorescent properties and improve the \nquantification of sugars using Raman spectroscopy in aqueous extracts of agave leaves powder. \nThe sequence of the work was as follows: the absorption wavelengths were identified using \nUV/Vis spec troscopy, the fluorescence spectrum of the samples was obtained by fluorescence \nspectroscopy, and the relationship between fluorescence and pH was studied by analyzing the \nRaman spectra performed at different pH values, and finally, the reducing sugars wer e identified \nin the Raman spectra. We found that the samples presented a strong fluorescence centered at \n500 nm and 680 nm, to deal with the fluorescence present in the Raman spectra, the pH of the \nsamples was modified from 4 to 12. It was found that at pH  9 the Raman signal presents a \nsignificant reduction in fluorescence and the damage caused by higher pH is avoided, when \ncomparing the Raman spectra at different pHs it remains undisturbed, expanding the detection \nlimits of reducing sugars. It is important  to mention that this work focused on studying the \nreduction of fluorescence in the Raman signal, for future investigations of carbohydrates and \nother compounds of interest present in agave leaves samples.

As some ZnO applications are related \nto oxygen vacancy densities, special emphasis was given  to the effects on the luminescent \nspectra due to these punctual defect concentrations. The ZnO samples were made by thermal \noxidation of metallic Zn thin films at 400oC in air atmosphere for 1 hour.

The IL was performed by bombarding the samples by 2 \nMeV 4 He ++ beam using the 3MV Pelletron Accelerator at the IF -UNAM. Part of the luminescent \nemission was cap tured by an optical fiber and registered with a spectrometer in the UV -VIS \nrange. The ionoluminiscent spectra were analyzed by the deconvolution of Gaussian peaks, each \none associated with a different punctual defect emission [1].

Particularly for Si cells, the absorption in the ultraviolet region is not very efficient \ndue to thermalization processes. In this direction, zinc phosphate glass activated with Ag mn+ and \nPr3+ were prepared by melt -quenching method. The X -Ray diffraction patterns showed \namorphous phases for doping contents up to 3.0 and 1.0 mol% of Ag+ and Pr3+, respectively. \nRaman spectroscopy revealed the existence of functional groups of tetrahedral phosphat e \nchains: D(P -O-P), V s(P-O-P), V s(PO 2),Q2 and V as(PO 2),Q2. The absorption spectra displayed the \ntypical absorption band of associated with the Ag mn+:S0 \u2192 S1 and Pr3:3H4\u2192 3P2+1I6, 3P1, 3P0, 1D2, \n3F4, 3F3 and 3F2. The visible emission spectra upon Ag mn+ cluster excitation at 350 nm exhibited \nthe characteristic  cluster: S 1, T2, T1 \u2192 S0 broad bands, which presented the creation of sinks as \nthe Pr3+ content increases, while the near infrared region displayed the Pr3+:1D2 \u2192 3F3,4 emission, \nas consequence of energy transfer from  clusters. The presence of sinks on the Ag mn+ cluster \nemission band revealed the existence of radiative energy transfer. Unde r Pr3+ excitation at 444 \nnm, the visible emission spectra showed the Pr3+: 3P0 \u2192 3H3,4,5,6 , 3P0 \u21923F2,3,4 and 3P0 \u2192 1G4 \ntransitions, whilst the near infrared region displayed the Pr3+: 1D2 \u2192 3H6,3F2,3,4 and 1D2 \u2192 1G4 \ntransitions. The Ag mn+ cluster emission decay profiles were shortened as the Pr3+ content \nincreases, which was attributed to non -radiative energy transfer.

The XRD patterns showed that the glass system is predominantly amorphous, with \na segregation of a crystalline phase related to CdO species. The effect of Er3+ doping on the \noptical transparency was evaluated by plotting ( \u03b1h\u03bd)2 and versus h \u03bd, for allowed \ndirect  transitions, showing that the Er3+ content increment did not modify the bandg ap energy, \nkeeping values around 2.75 and 2.50 eV, respectively. By using the Dimitrov -Sakka \napproximation, a refractive index value of 2.51 was found.

The \nemission spectra in the infrared region, exciting at 521 nm, showed the characteristic Er3+:4I13/2\u2192 \n4I15/2 emission band centered at 1533 nm.

This type of electroless etching to form porous silicon is well known as stain etching. \nPorous silicon powder (PSP) has attracted much attention due to its characteristic \nphotoluminescence, large specific surface area, and controllable physical and chemical \nproperti es (with the porosity) for its application in many fields, particularly in \noptical/chemical/biological sensors and other devices[1].  In the present work, stain etching was \nused to prepare PSP metallurgical silicon powder. For stain etching it is usually ne cessary to add \na metal salt (iron salts, for example), which at the end of the process leaves a stain mark in a \nporous layer. However, in this work the addition of the salt was not necessary since metallurgical \ngrade silicon already contains high levels of  iron impurities. The photoluminescence of the \nproduced PSP exhibits a characteristic spectrum, given by surface defects and metallic \nimpurities. In order to see if some of the defects of PSP are non -radiative, it was chemically \noxidized with oxidants of d ifferent nature (acetic acid, nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide). Each \noxidant had a different effect on the photoluminescence. The photoluminescence intensity is \ngreatly reduced when applying hydrogen peroxide, which passivates the dangling bonds of the \nporosified surface producing silicon oxides. On the other hand, the interaction between PSP and \nnitritic acid or acetic acid enhances the intensity by removing impurities the material, which act \nas recombination centers. By these chemical treatments, it was  then possible to tune the shape \nof the emission spectra, and to maximize their intensity. Large quantities of PSP with optimized \nphotoluminescence could be obtained by stain etching followed by chemical oxidation, which \nrepresent a simple and economic pro cess. The powders could be used for sensors of oxidative \nsubstances.  \nKeywords: porous silicon, photoluminescence quenching, photoluminescence enhancement  \nAuthor for correspondence:  xairo.l.v@gmail.com  \nReference:  [1]V\u00e1zsonyi, \u00c9., et al. \"Porous silicon formation by stain etching.\"  Thin Solid \nFilms  388.1 -2 (2001): 295 -302.  \nThis  work was supported by:  CONACYT  \n  \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n98  \n \n[ LPM -49 ] SYNTHESIS AND PRELIMINARY STUDIES OF NOVEL \nNa2 -xCsxZrO3 PEROVSKITE NANOPARTICLES  \nNATHAN AKACHE ABUTU (abutu.nathan@cimav.edu.mx) 1 , NATHAN AKACHE ABUTU 3 , ARMANDO \nREYES -ROJAS (armando.reyes@cimav.edu.mx) 1 , AHEMEN IORKYAA 2  \n1 Centro de Investigacion en Material Avanzado, Chihuahua -Chihuahua Mexico  \n2 Federal University of Agriculture, PMB.  2373, Makurdi, Nigeria  \n3 Federal University of Agriculture, PMB. 2373, Makurdi, Nigeria  \nThe influence of Cesium doping on structural and optical characteristics of sodium zirconate has \nbeen investigated.

Specifically, the CsPbCl 3 structure has \nthe largest exciton binding energy and has been reported as an extremely sensitizer Yb3+ \nluminescence in nanocrystals, achieving photoluminescence quantum yields greater than 100%, \na consequence of the quantum cutting effect. However, little has been reported about the \nreproducibility of this effect in thin films. The present work uses the Ae rosol Assisted Chemical \nVapor Deposition (AA -CVD) technique for depositing CsPbCl 3-Yb3+ perovskite films, resulting in a \ncost-effective alternative that allows antisolvent use in situ for assisted crystallization. \nContinuing in this green route, we analyze d the non -toxic antisolvent effects in the film \nmorphology and stoichiometry and how these can contribute to the effective doping mechanism \nmodel, in which 2 Yb3+ ions replace 3 Pb2+ ions in the crystal lattice of CsPbCl 3, generating a \nbidimensional perovs kite phase CsPb 2Cl5. Results show that   H20 is an alternative green solvent \nthat reproduces the sensitization of Yb 3+ in CsPbCl3 films deposited by AA -CVD and how the \ngeneration of the CsPb 2Cl5 phase is an indicator of this adequate sensitization. Moreover , we \ncan control crystal size using green antisolvent that impacts the luminescence properties at a \ndifferent wavelength.   \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n100  \n \nSesi\u00f3n Oral  \n[ LPM -313 ] Antenna effect in CaF2: Nd/Yb/Li phosphors when \nare paired with 2 -thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA)  \nJessica De Anda Gil (jessica.deanda@cinvestav.mx) 3 , Jesus Uriel Balderas Aguilar 2 , Ciro Falcony \nGuajardo 1  \n1 F\u00edsica, CINVESTAV, Av.

Therefore, \ndifferent precursors, synthesis processes, and junctions with other materi als have been \ninvestigated in order to improve the luminescence of these compounds. An approach to \nimprove the absorption range of lanthanide -based luminescent materials involves the use of \norganic ligands. It is well known that the absorption peaks of lan thanides ions are narrow \nbecause of their intrinsic electric properties. In this way, chromophores or organic ligands, with \nhigher absorption capacities, serve as antennas when bound to lanthanides. In this work, CaF 2: \nNd/Yb/Li phosphors were coupled with 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetate (TTA) to increase their \nluminescence in the near -infrared region upon UV excitation region.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n101  \n \n[ LPM -176 ]  Carbon luminescent nanoparticles for diagnostics \nand treatment of cancer  \nEnrique Esparza Alegria (espaleg@ciencias.unam.mx) 2 , Ismael Arturo Gardu \u00f1o Wilches 1 , Roc \u00edo \nGuadalupe Casa \u00f1as Pimentel 3 , Eduardo San Mart \u00edn Mart \u00ednez 3  \n1 C\u00e1tedras Conacyt/Cen tro de Investigaci\u00f3n  en Ciencia Aplicada y Tecnolog \u00eda Avanzada, Unidad \nLegar \u00eda, IPN.

Phosphor converted WLEDs are \nthe most common, however the color rendering index (<85) is less than expected for high quality \ngeneral illumination. Recently, emission -tunable phosphors have been developed to avoid this \ndisadvantage. Metal halides such as K 2CuCl 3 emit light with high efficiency due to their low \ndimensional structure and self -trapped exciton phenomenon1. In this work, SiO 2/K2CuCl 3 Mn-\ndoped composite material with a broad emission spectrum (350 -550 nm) is proposed. We \nconducted the synthesis of this materials by Chemical Vapor Deposition, where precursors \nsolutions and TEOS were  ultrasonically nebulized and transported in N 2 to a tube furnace at 680 \n\u00b0C. The doping of manganese was controlled by varying the percent present in precursor \nsolutions, ranging from 1.5% to 10% mol. To enhance their morphology and eliminate reaction \nby-products, we annealed the powders at 800\u00b0C and 1000\u00b0C for two hours. Structure, \nmorphology, chemical composition, and optical properties of the composites were \ncharacterized using X -Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier \nTransfor m Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and UV -Visible \nspectroscopy (UV -Vis). Doping the photoluminescent material to promote energy transfer can \nproduce novel luminescent materials for high -performance pc -WLED devices.  \n1Creason , Tielyr D., Timothy M.

This latest synthesis has proven to be an excellent and versatile way \nto obtain different types of transition metal fluoride materials.

In this research work, we show a \nnovel microwave assisted fluorolytic sol gel synthesis of microcrystalline K 2TiF 6 in 20 minutes at \n150 \u00b0C. Ammonium fluoride (NH 4F) was used as a fl uorination source instead of highly toxic \nhydrofluoric acid.

Photoluminescence spectra of Mn4+ doped K 2TiF 6 \nmicrocrystals show a group  of sharp peaks between 600 - 650 nm because of electronic \ntransitions (2Eg to 4A2g) of Mn4+ ion, and whose PL maximum wavelength emission is centered at \n630 nm.

The CW -OSL \nmethod is used in different applications such as: radiation protection (occupational and patient dosimetry, \nemergency response, area radiation monitoring), archeological and geological dating, food irradiation, \naccident dosimetry and  material research. In this work the CW -OSL properties of dose -response, \nrepeatability and fading of Thulium -doped Magnesium Pyrophosphate (Mg 2P2O7:Tm3+) material were \nstudied.

The stimulated emissions of \npowders were detected in the UV region through a set of filters Hoya U340 and Delta BP 365/50 EX. A blue \nemission (440 -470 nm) of Tm3+ ions due to  1D2 \u2192 3F4 transition is observed in the PL e mission spectrum \nand a UV band at 350 nm related to energy absorption from  3H6ground level to  1D2 excited level of \nTm3+ ions is shown in the PL excitation spectrum.   A monoclinic crystalline phase is determined by XRD in \nthe of Mg 2P2O2:Tm3+ material. The M g2P2O7:Tm3+ powders were exposed to  90Sr beta particles from 0.1 to \n200 Gy. The powders show an intense CW -OSL curve with a fast decay within 5 s after stimulation. The CW -\nOSL intensity increases with the beta dose up to 200 Gy. A linear response from 0.1 to 65 Gy and a supra -\nlinear range of 75 -200 Gy are observed in the CW -OSL dose response test. After ten cycles of irradiation at \n1 Gy and CW -OLS reading the Mg 2P2O7:Tm3+ powders exhibit a well repeatability with a variation coefficient \nof 0.75%. The CW -OSL intensity of powders decreases with the storage time increase.

Benefits such as solution process, cost -effective and large -scale \ndeposition, flexibility, and low -temperature process is  critical for stimulating future flexible \nelectronics device applications. Using the advantage of O -I hybrid materials, we present several \nHfAlO x-PVP hybrid thin films in this study by incorporation of hafnium derivatives into pristine \nAlO x-PVP hybrid solu tion. A facile dip -coating approach was used to deposit the hybrid thin films \nwith a low processing temperature of 200 oC. We further studied the effect of Hf derivatives in \nhybrid thin films and their dielectric properties by varying the Hf/Al molar ratio s. This study \nfound that addition of Hf into hybrid thin films increased their dielectric characteristics more \nthan AlO x-PVP hybrid thin films. The dielectric properties performed on MIM capacitor structures \nshowed low leakage current density of the order of 10-8A/cm2.

In \nconsequence, different types of sensors for aqueous ammonia solutions have been fabricated. \nElectrochemical sensors have arisen special attention due to their simple and affordable \nmanufacturing proce sses, easy miniaturization, and good sensitivity. In the present project, we \npropose fabricating a new electrochemical sensor based on copper -decorated silicon nanowalls \nfor the detection of NH 3 in aqueous solutions. Its detection mechanism is based on \nelectrochemical reactions of copper (Cu) in NH 3 solutions [1]. Sensor\u2019s components are a) A \nworking electrode made of copper nanoparticles that are deposited by an electroless wet \nchemical method. b) Silicon nanowalls prepared by Metal Assisted Chemical Etchi ng (MacEtch), \nwhich serve as receptacles for the analyte. c) A counter electrode made of a noble metal film or \nwire.  \nWe were able to synthesize Si nanowalls with a length of around 5 \u03bcm, which assures that the \nsensed solution infiltrates to the bottom avoid ing diffusion limitation. Using polyethylene glycol \nas a surfactant, Cu nanoparticles were evenly deposited by an electroless route on the surface \nof the silicon nanowalls. Solutions with different ammonia concentrations were analyzed by \ncyclic voltammetry  using the sensor. Was identified a peak in the voltammogram whose intensity \ncorrelates with the concentration of ammonia in the solution. The voltammetric peak is \nassociated with the oxidation of metallic Cu to Cu2+ due to the formation of cupric oxide an d Cu -\nNH 3 complexes. Measuring solutions of different concentrations allowed to plot a calibration \ncurve to determine the concentration of solutions with unknown ammonia concentrations. The \npresent work represents a step forward towards the miniaturization of elect rochemical sensors \nof liquid ammonia solutions. There is not such a device in the literature.  \nReference : S.

As a widely used academic tool, this technique is also the platform for scientific \nstudies to develop novel 3D microstructures using silicon or other subs trates. Some \nexperimental microcavities, based on (0 0 1) silicon micromachining and aqueous potassium \nhydroxide (KOH) solutions, were analyzed in this work.  \nFirst, the precise alignment of squared -patterns parallel to the <1 1 0> axes of the oxidized \nsubs trates, lithography transferred over the photoresist, and finally, etching of squared cavities \ninto the oxide film. After this selective etching step, the usually inverted pyramids develop by \nthe anisotropy of the aqueous KOH solution into the (0 0 1) sili con. Then after stripping off the \nremaining oxide film, a second unmasked micromachining step is realized. This procedure \nreported by Kendall [XX] is under discussion because this unmasked anisotropic etching leads \nto developing aspheric cavities named mic ro-lenses.  \nThe critical mechanism supporting this technique is the two -step etching following some fast -\netching planes appearing around the surface squared cavity; after several hours, this procedure \nleads to rounded cavities taking advantage of the four -fold symmetry of the planar (0 0 1) \nsurfaces.  \nAbout these rounded microstructures development, we identify the lack of thorough studies for \nthese mechanisms leading to the controlled production of semi -circular structures, mainly when \nvaried patterns are anisotropy evolving over these aspheric surfaces hosted into the low -index \nsilicon.  \nIn this contribution, new procedures for multi -step bulk micromachining based on (0 0 1) silicon \nsubstrates are presented, and additionally analyzes some mechanisms whi ch produce varied \naspheric cavities.

Copper o xide thin films were \nchemically synthesized on glass substrates using the successive ionic layers absorption and \nreaction (SILAR) method, which is an easy and inexpensive process. The chemical deposition \nconsisted of 4 steps, using a solution of copper chl oride complexed with ammonium hydroxide \nin deionized water as a cationic precursor, and deionized water at 90\u00b0C as an anionic precursor, \nan empty container as a drying stage, and finally a rinse bath in deionized water. The formation \nof thin films was iden tified thanks to deposition effects such as molar concentration of precursor \nmaterials, number of deposition cycles, pH of precursor solutions, immersion time and bath \ntemperature, as well as final heat treatments. The resulting thin films were characteriz ed and \nstudied by X -ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet -visible spectroscopy (UV -Vis), scanning electron \nmicroscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) characteristics. These analyses were \nperformed to identify the structural, optical, and morphologica l properties of the metal oxide \nsemiconductor material.

Also, it \nis well known that by varying the relative oxygen partial pressure (ppO 2) and the working \npressure, the carrier type of the SnO x thin films can change from p -type to n -type1. In this work, \nwe obtained SnO x thin films by DC magnetron sputtering varying the ppO 2 from 4.8 to 18.5%, \nthe working pressure between 1.8 and 4.0 mTorr and using a power of 30 W. SnOx thin films \nwere annealed at 180 \u00b0C for 30 min to ensure the complete formation of the SnO phase. The \nthin fi lms were well -characterized by XRD, XPS, UV -vis, and Hall Effect. After the annealing at 180 \n\u00b0C, the films exhibited a tetragonal structure with Sn traces. P -type SnOx thin films were \nobtained in a ppO 2 range from 4.8% to 9.5%. XPS results demonstrated tha t the thin film \ndeposited at ppO 2 of 8%, had Sn2+ content of 70%, and by further annealing it decreased to \n34.3%. At ppO 2 of 18.5 % the Sn2+ content decreased from 42% to 39.8%, after annealing. SnOx \nfilm at ppO 2 of 18.5 % underwent less oxidation after an nealing and showed n -type behavior. \nUsing the conditions to obtain SnO x thin films with n -type and p -type behavior, a p -n diode was \nfabricated using SnO x thin film at a ppO 2 of 8.0 % and of 18.5 % on glass and polyimide substrates \nusing lithography techniq ues. SnO x junctions on polyimide exhibit I \u2013V rectifying characteristics \nwith a turn -on voltage of 2.24 V using Cr and ITO contacts. The diode fabricated on a flexible \nsubstrate retained its rectifying behavior even when it is bent, making it attractive for  the \ntransparent and flexible electronics.  \nKeywords: SnOx thin films, oxygen partial pressure, p -n junction,  low temperature annealing, \nand flexible diode.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  angegar19@gmail.com  \nReference : J.A.

Simulation software works by using \nmathematical models of the devices, which represent the behavior of the d evices in the real \nworld. The models are composed of parameters, which change from one device to another, but \nthe value assigned to them, will define if the simulation will correspond to the behavior in the \nreal world. For this reason it is of utmost impor tance to know the parameters of the devices, for \nwhich a process known as parameter extraction is performed. In the state of the art there are \nmainly analytical methods to perform this task, although methods based on genetic algorithms \n(GAs) have also been  proposed as an alternative. Analytical methods require a lot of experience \nand knowledge in the operation of the device models, or defining the correct fitness function in \nthe case of GAs to obtain good results. Therefore, an alternative to extract parame ters based on \nsupervised learning is proposed. Neural networks (NN)s, Random Forest (RF) and Support vector \nRegression (SVR) have been applied for parameter extraction in Thin Film Transistors (TFT). \nThese methods are trained with sample I -V curves from wh ich they must identify/predict the \nparameters that correspond to each sample. The proposed method has been shown to provide \nparameters that allow a modeling of experimental measurements of TFTs. Avoiding the need of \nhaving experience in parameter extractio n and deep knowledge in the operation of the devices.  \nKeywords:  Parameter extraction, Thin film transistors, Supervised learning, Machine learning, \nElectronic simulation.  \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n119  \n \n[ MEM -359 ]  SIGNAL INTEGRITY FOR SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE \nDELAY LINE SENSOR USING MATCHING NETWORK  \nIrving Vallarta Ramirez (ivallartar2100@alumno.ipn.mx) 2 , Alonso Fern \u00e1ndez Garc \u00eda 2 , Veronica Irais \nSolis Tinoco 1 , Miguel \u00c1ngel Alem \u00e1n Arce 1 , Juan Carlos S \u00e1nchez Ga rc\u00eda (jcsanche@ipn.mx)  \n1 Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  en Computaci \u00f3n - Instituto Polit \u00e9cnico Nacional (CIC -IPN), C.P. 07738, \nCiudad de M \u00e9xico, M \u00e9xico \n2 Escuela Superior de Ingenier \u00eda Mec \u00e1nica y El \u00e9ctrica - Instituto Polit \u00e9cnico Nacional (ESIME -IPN), C.P. \n04440, Ciudad de M \u00e9xico, M \u00e9xico \nThe radiofrequency (RF) signal on a surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor, in its configuration as a \ndelay line, must have a special treatment at the input and output ports that will ensure an \noptimum performance of the sensor. A design of a complete SAW devi ce must include external \ncircuitry made of passive or active electronic elements that are connected to the input and \noutput interdigital transducers (IDTs). The SAW sensor is considered as a 2 -port network, and \neach port has a certain impedance level due t o the design and fabrication of the IDTs. The \nconsequence of an impedance mismatch is a poor transfer of the power signal to the SAW \nsensor. A part of the signal will be reflected from the input transducer to the source and on the \nother side, from the load  to the output transducer. This work presents a methodology for the \ndesign of a matching network that ensures an optimum RF power transfer between the SAW \nsensor ports and circuits. First, a simulation of the frequency response of a SAW sensor with a \nreson ance frequency of 112.96 MHz is shown, the simulation is programmed in MATLAB  \nsoftware. It is possible to calculate the admittance parameters of the sensor, and through them \ncalculate the reflection coefficients S 11 and S 22, the return loss and the voltage  standing wave \nratio (VSWR) of each SAW sensor port. Therefore, the design of the matching network topologies \nL and \u03c0 are achieved through the resonance method and the Smith chart. This work shows that \nif a matching network is not used, 67% of the power si gnal could be reflected at the SAW sensor \nports. Furthermore, we describe the advantages to the SAW sensor signal of having different \nquality factors Q from the two types of the matching network topologies.  \nKeywords:  RF signal, SAW sensor, reflection coeff icients, return loss, matching network.  \nThis work was supported by : CONACYT master\u2019s program scholarship, IPN BEIFI SIP project \n20221690.  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n120  \n \n[ MEM -91 ] Thin film phototransistors CdSe with TiSiOx -PVP \nhybrid gate dielectric, all -solution processed.  \nRafael Ramirez Bon (rrbon@cinvestav.mx) 3 , Maria de la Soledad de Urquijo Ventura \n(maria.urquijo@cinvestav.mx) 3 , Fernando Garibay Martinez 3 , Mullapudi Gouri Syamala Rao 3 , Kolli \nChandra Sekhar Reddy 3 , Victor Hugo Mart \u00ednez Landeros 1 , Eduardo Mart \u00ednez Guerra 2  \n1 2Universidad Aut \u00f3noma de Coahuila Carretera 57, Monclova, Coah.

It is relatively \neasy to obtain n -type conductivity ZnO. On the other hand, the fabric ation of p -type ZnO is not \nwell established, and its reproducibility and long term stability are still under debate. \nFurthermore, according to most of the reports of p -type ZnO, temperature deposition \nand annealing processing above 400\u00b0C  are required, whic h is incompatible with some \napplications such as device fabrication on  flexible substrates. In this work, we present the low \ntemperature (<200\u00b0C) microfabrication processing and electrical characterization of a p -channel \nthin film transistor (TFT) as well as a p -n homojunction diode. We employed reactive pulsed laser \ndeposition (RPLD) at room temperature to deposit p -type nitrogen -doped zinc oxide (ZnO:N) \nthin films and n -type zinc oxide(ZnO) thin films. ZnO and ZnO:N had carrier concentration of -\n5.8\u00d717cm-3 and +1\u00d718cm-3; mobility of 0.16 cm2 V-1 s-1 and 0.5 cm2 V-1 s-1; resistivity of 10 \nohm*cm and 5 ohm*cm, respectively. Both materials exhibited an Eg=3.29 eV, determined by \ncathodoluminescence. The homojunction diode had the following structure: bottom el ectrode, \nn-type ohmic contact, n -type ZnO, p -type ZnO:N, parylene -C as the insulating layer, and finally \ntop electrodes. The diode exhibited rectification behavior and threshold voltage as low as 0.3 V. \nThe thin film transistor had a staggered bottom gate architecture, with the following \nconfiguration: bottom gate, dielectric, p -type ZnO:N, semiconductor passivation/encapsulation \nlayer, and source, drain and gate top electrodes. The TFT exhibited field effect modulation by \npositive gate voltage polarization , with I DS current as high as -1\u00d710-3 A. Both microdevices were \nfabricated employing photomask -assisted photolithography. The electrical nature of the  devices \nallows us to conclude  that we successfully achieved p -type behavior ZnO:N by  room \ntemperature RPLD.  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n122  \n \nMULTIFUNCTIONAL AND MAGNETICS \nMATERIALS    \nCHAIRMEN  \nDr Jes\u00fas Heiras Aguirre (CNYN -UNAM),  heiras@cnyn.unam.mx  \nDr. Jos\u00e9 Trinidad Elizalde Galindo (UACJ)  jose.elizalde@uacj.mx  \nMaterials capable of performing two or more primay functions, either simulteously or \nsequentially, are called multifunctional.

Besides, the technology around us has a \nfundaental basis in magnetic materials.

Recent studies  highlight its use as a photo -catalyzer to reduce carbon dioxide \n(CO2) and water treatment, having formic acid and  formaldehydes as products.  In the present work, the \nphotovoltaic efficiency of liquid suspensions of LN  doped with several iron (Fe) concentrations was \nassessed by means of cyclic voltammetrymeasurements.  Six LN:Fe  powders with variable doping \nconcentrati on in the range 0.8 -6.0 wt.  % Fe2O3  have been prepared.  They are derived from the synthesis \nof a common base material (the pristine structure), pure ferroelectric LN powders with the congruent \nchemical composition (LNCG, congruent point described by the ra tio Li:Nb  = 48.5:51.5). The pristine \nand LN:Fe  samples were then subjected to thermal treatments in both reducing and oxidizing \natmospheres, so that in total 21 samples were available for analysis \u2013accounting also for samples without \npost -thermal treatment . All samples were characterized by X -Ray Diffraction and confocal Raman \nSpectroscopy.  Mostly, pure ferroelectric solid solutions of  LN:Fe  were obtained, except for the two highest \ndoping concentrations of 4.5 and 6.0  wt. % Fe2O3.  Structural refinement pro cedures by the Rietveld \nmethod reveal that the percentage value of the  secondary phase (Fe based) is marginal for the 4.5  doping \nconcentration, regardless of the oxidation state of the samples. The photovoltaic studies  show  the viability \nof LN:Fe  as a phot o-assisted catalyzer  (high doping concentrations).  On the other hand, the (optical) \nabsorbance of the  pristine  samples presents the expected  linear  behavior (Beer -Lambert law) in the \nranges of 10 -4 and 10 -5 M(acetone), whereas the determined band gap  (Tauc  plot method)  shows a \nreverse tendency ( Eg lowers significantly as the concentration ratio is increased in the suspension) which \nis highly sensitive to  the scattering properties of the suspended LN particles.  \nKeywords:  lithium niobate,  iron\u2014doped, photo -assisted catalysis, optical absorption, liquid suspensions  \nReferences:   R.K.

Among them, the \nlow-entropy alloy of equal proportion between Fe, Co and Ni has a Curie temperature close to \n1000 K, this alloy can have technological applications at room temperature if the Curie \ntemperature is lowered. T he main objective is to modify the proportion between the alloyed \nelements to lower the Curie temperature. 7 new alloys were synthesized using an electric arc \nmelting furnace with the following atomic ratios between Fe:Co:Ni = 25:25:50, 20:20:60, 15:15:70,  \n10:10:80 and Fe:Co:Ni:Mn = 9.5:9.5:76:5, 8.5:8.5:68:15, 7.5:7.5:60:25. It was determined that the \nlow and medium entropy alloys present an FCC structure without impurities, the lattice \nparameters obtained by X -ray diffraction patterns indicate a correlati on between the changes \nof these parameters with the degree of substitution, there was a decrease in the FeCoNi alloys; \ninstead, the FeCoNiMn alloys there was an increase. In addition, a reduction of the Curie \ntemperature from 1000 K to 855 K was determined  by modifying the degree of magnetic \ninteraction between the three ferromagnetic elements in the low -entropy alloy. It is possible to \nadjust the Curie temperature in alloys based on Fe, Co, and Ni by modifying the proportion of \nthese elements, however, to lower this temperature further, incorporating and increasing the \nconcentration of Mn in the alloy will cause a dilution effect since this is a non -magnetic element.  \nKeywords:  Low entropy alloy; Magnetic properties; Curie Temperature; X -ray diffraction, Cry stal \nstructure.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  jose.elizalde@uacj.mx  \nThis work was supported by:  Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda,  national traditional \ndoctorate scholarship program, scholarship number: 817062  \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n129  \n \n[ MUL -113 ] THE EFFECT OF THE Co CONTENT ON MAGNETIC \nPROPERTIES OF CaF2  \nAna Gabriela Soto Flores (so387922@uaeh.edu.mx) 1 , Uriel Mart \u00ednez Maya 1 , Lesly Andrea Aguilar \nRomo 1 , Estrella Flores G \u00f3mez 1 , Santiago Cruz Calder \u00f3n 1 , Ariadna S \u00e1nchez Castillo 1 , Mar \u00eda del \nPilar Guti \u00e9rrez Amador (amadorg@uaeh.edu.mx) 1  \n1 Escuela Superior de Apan, Unive rsidad Aut \u00f3noma del Estado de Hidalgo.

Magnetite NPs were synthesized by th e coprecipitation method. Using ferrous and ferric chloride \nsalts (molar ratio of 2:1) and aqueous NH4OH solution. Over the magnetite core, it was grown a SiOx \nshell  by the St\u00f6ber method. First, the previously synthetized magnetite (as core), was redisper sed in \ntetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) (precursor for SiOx shell), and those volumes were calculated for theoretical \nshell thicknesses of 5, 10, 15 and 20 nm. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron \nMicroscopy (SEM) images of magnetite  NPs revealed that most of the particles are spherical with a regular \naverage size (16.67 nm) and agglomerated. SEM images of the core -shell revealed irregular shell surfaces \naround the magnetite NPs. SAED (Selected Area Electron Diffraction) analysis for the core -shell NPs \ncharacterized crystallographic planes of oxidized magnetite species such as maghemite and hematite as \nwell as the presence of SiOx. In the electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of 5 nm core \nmagnetite and bare magnetite, a broad  signal representing hysteresis is shown. The wave amplitude of the \nEPR resonance signal is due to the random orientation of the ferromagnetic particles, which scatter in the \ndirections of the anisotropic field produced in the 10 to 20 nm thick samples by the coalescence between \nmagnetite and silicon oxide originating an interface signal. A thin film transistor (TFT) was used to obtain \nthe electrical properties of the core -shell NPs through output curves.

Recently, it has been reported that earthquakelike \ndynamics can be quantitatively described in detail at the laboratory  scale, by performing shear experiments \nin granular media. In principle, remote, non -invasive SHG could be proposed as a probe to describe and \npredict seismic phenomena. Thus, a search follows immediately for novel seismic sensors (or gravisensors), \nwhich could operate under similar principles used by plants to maintain their vertical posture as they grow. \nSix LN:Fe powders with variable doping concentration in the range 0.8 -6.0 wt. % Fe2O3 have been \nprepared. They are derived from the synthesis of a common  base material (the pristine structure), pure \nferroelectric LN powders with the congruent chemical composition (LNCG, congruent point described by \nthe ratio Li:Nb = 48.5:51.5). The pristine and LN:Fe samples were then subjected to thermal treatments in \nboth reducing and oxidizing atmospheres, so that in total 21 samples were available for analysis \u2013\naccounting also for samples without post -thermal treatment. All samples were characterized by X -Ray \nDiffraction and confocal Raman Spectroscopy. Representative s ets of samples also have been studied in \ndetail regarding SHG, both in presence and absence of an external constant magnetic field, with emphasis \non the reduced LN:Fe samples. Detailed SHG measurements convey the obtention of intensity depth \nprofiles plus rotation of the linear polarization of the fundamental wave at selected depths, as previously \nreported in a contribution achieved by close collaboration between our researching groups. On this \ninstance, however, we have focused the polarization analysis on  a single depth, that at which the SHG \nintensities are maximal; distortions in the polarization -resolved plots can be traced because the SHG \ncontribution from ballistic photons dominates that of multiply scattered photons which is naturally \nunpolarized.   \nKeywords: lithium niobate, second harmonic generation, ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, granular media  \nReferences:  S.

Interaction \neffects in magnetic particle arrays play a very important role since they modify the energy \nlandscape of the individual particles in the array. A direct consequence of the interaction field is \nthat the properties measured on the entire array differ from those of the individual constituents, \nresulting in two fundamentally important problems: (1) understanding how the the properties \nof the array can be controlled o tailored using the intrinsic prope rties of the individual particles \nand the interaction between them, and (2) elucidate the intrinsic properties of the individual \nparticles by interpreting the measurements obtained from the array which contain the \nadditional contributions of the interactio n field. Both problems require knowledge of the \ninteraction field. In this sense, we propose and validate a method to quantify the interaction \nfield based on the assumption that the interaction field can be related to asymmetries between \nmagnetization and demagnetization curves. To this end, arrays of magnetic nanowires have \nbeen used and interaction effects have been studied using minor loops as well as \ncomplementary remanence curves. The results show that the method allows quantifying the \ninteraction fiel d as an average value or as a set of measurements that provide an interaction \nfield distribution. We discuss the validity, limitations as well as possible improvements of the \nmethod to provide an accurate value of the average interaction field as well as f or the interaction \nfield distribution.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n135  \n \n[ MUL -339 ] VOLTAGE -CONTROLLED RESISTANCE SWITCHING IN \nTHERMALLY BIASED VO2 PLANAR MICRO -DEVICE  \nAlfredo Mamian (amamianm@unicauca.edu.co) 3 , Jhon Jairo Realpe 3 , Jesus Heiras \n(heiras@cnyn.unam.mx) 1 , Eval Baca 2 , N\u00e9stor Guti \u00e9rrez 3 , Gilberto Bola \u00f1os 3  \n1 Centro de Nanociencias y Nanotecnolog \u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut \u00f3noma de M \u00e9xico, AP 14, \nEnsenada B.C, 22860, M \u00e9xico \n2 Grupo de Ingenier \u00eda de Nuevos Materiales, Universida d del Valle, A.A. 25360, Cali, Colombia  \n3 Laboratorio de F \u00edsica de Bajas Temperaturas, Universidad del Cauca, Carrera 2A # 3N -111, \nPopay \u00e1n, 190002, Colombia  \nComplex metal oxides are now being under extensive research as they are a feasible alternative \nto extend the functionality of oxide electronics for information processing and storage beyond \nCMOS scalability in the nanotechnology industry. Researchers expect that this alternative could \ncope with the physical limits and their quantum effec ts. It is important to look for novel devices \nwith enhanced storage density and long retention time. Novel devices could be based on \nrecently discovered properties, such as the Structural Phase Transition and the Metal -Insulator \nTransition. They may be com patible with the integration processes of CMOS devices and capable \nof supplying the next generation of universal memories and processors. However, a scalability \nlimit on the size of such devices is not clear and it is necessary to make a robust device. \nVanadium dioxide (VO2) undergoes both mentioned transitions at a critical temperature of 68\u00b0. \nBelow this Tc it exhibits a semiconductor behavior (monoclinic structure) while for temperatures \nhigher than Tc it exhibits a metallic behavior (tetragonal structure .) In this work, VO2 370 nm \nfilms were grown (DC sputtering) on Al 2O3 (0001) substrates. With these films microdevices were \nfabricated using contact UV photolithography. We found that it was feasible to control the \nthreshold voltage of the transition by an  external voltage in a thermally biased two -terminal  60, \n36, 33 and 20 volts, respectively. I vs. V curves show a pronounced hysteresis and an abrupt \njump in electrical conductivity indicating a clear transition. Some advantages of our device are: \nrobustn ess, simple architecture and integration, and excellent performance in noisy \nsurroundings. However, its high frequency response has not been yet evaluated and the power \nrequired may be high. Our oxide film is thicker than most devices reported by others.  \nKeywords: vanadium dioxide, Metal to Insulator Transition, Structural Phase Transition, \nresistance switching, photolithography.  \nAuthor for correspondence: heiras@cnyn.unam.mx  \nReference:  [1] A.

The most attractive approach of this work was the obtaining of Bi 2Te3 hexagonal \nnanoplates without employing expensive equipment, but by using a simple technique at \natmospheric pressure in a simple convection oven at low temperature. The Bi 2Te3 was processed \ninto powder and drop -casted deposited on commercial glass substrates for its chemical, \nstructural and optical analysis. Results of electron microscopy analysis indicate that our \nsimplified  method allowed the crystallization of Bi 2Te3 in highly crystalline hexagonal nanoplates, \ngrown along the basal plane corresponding to the rhombohedral crystalline phase of Bi 2Te3, \nwhich resulted oriented in the (101) direction. The hexagonal crystals exhi bited an extension of \nup to several hundred nanometers, with thicknesses minor than the Bohr radius of the exciton \nfor Bi 2Te3, within the interval of 20 to 40 nm, and with an interplanar spacing of 0.37 nm, which \nconfirms the growth of the nanostructure al ong the basal plane of the rhombohedral crystalline \nphase of Bi 2Te3. Likewise, Raman spectroscopy exhibited a vibrational mode around 120 cm-1, \ncorresponding to the mode, which appears due to the breaking of the symmetry of the crystal \nin the C axis of the  rhombohedral structure of Bi 2Te3, so that the thickness of the crystal is an \norder magnitude less than its extension. Finally, chemical characterization by XPS showed that \ndespite the strong reactivity of the Te2- ion precursor with the ambient oxygen doe s not inhibit \nthe Bi 2Te3 crystallization in hexagonal nanoplates under atmospheric pressure conditions at a \nlower temperature than that reported in other works.  \nKeywords: Thermoelectric, bismuth telluride, chalcogenides, atmospheric pressure, \nnanoplates.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  lreyesv@uanl.edu.mx  \nThis work was supported by:   Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CONACyT -M\u00e9xico) by \nits sponsorship under the grant \u201cEstancias Posdoctorales por M\u00e9xico 2021 (1)\u201d.  \nCorresponding  author  and the presenting  author:  Laura A.

Postal 22860, Ensenada Baja California, M \u00e9xico \nTransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a vast class of two -dimensional materials with the general \nformula MX 2, where M is a transition metal (TM), and X is a chalcogen element. The interest in TMDs has \nbrought their application as ideal catalytic models in the fuel enhancement process for the removal of \nNitrogen, Sulfur, metallic atoms, and enhancement of hydrocarbons. The  higher catalytic activity of TMDs \nhas been correlated with the incorporation of noble metals on MoS 2. Moreover, in light of the \nexperimentally observed triangular morphologies in which the MoS 2 system stabilizes under sulfiding \nconditions, the edge termination has been taken into account as a further descriptor of the distinctive \ncatalytic activity exhibited by these structures. Several inquiries about the precise location of the promoter \nadatom s, edge termination role, or the existence of a size -dependent catalytic effect remain an open \ndebate. In this work, employing density functional theory, we describe the adsorption, diffusion, and \nincorporation mechanisms of single atom TM: Ru, Rh, and Pd to form promoted MoS 2 triangular structures. \nThe models are consistent with the experimentally observed terminations -Mo(10 -10) and S( -1010) -. Our \nresults show that in both systems, the adatoms adsorb on a hollow site over the basal plane; however, a \nlater al four -fold configuration with the S atoms over the edge is the lowest energy configuration. Two \ndiffusion trajectories -starting from the basal plane toward the lateral site - are presented for each \ntermination. We have employed the surface formation ener gy (SFE) formalism to analyze the stability of \nincorporations considering exchanges between adatoms and one Mo atom at the center, lateral edge, and \ntip against the lateral adsorption. Upon varying the chemical potential limits, the analysis unveils that f or \nMo poor conditions, the incorporation is favored only in the lateral site but depends on the adatom's size.  \nKeywords: Transition -metal dichalcogenides, edge -termination, stability, promoter, diffusion, DFT.  \nAuthor for correspondence: paez@ens.cnyn.unam. mx \nJ.I.

The advantage of using low cost and low toxicity materials represents a great \npossibility to apply nanoparticles in unexplored areas of medicine and industry. In addition to \nother nano technological applications such as catalysis, electrocatalysis, optoelectronics, \nsensors, coatings and photothermal therapies. A novel bottom -up synthesis method for \nobtaining multi -form silver nanoparticles at room temperature in suspension with high stab ility \nis presented in this work. The nanostructures were analyzed using different characterization \ntechniques. Morphological and structural parameters were analyzed by TEM microscopy. The \nimages corroborated the presence of silver nanoparticles in solution  with different geometrical \nshapes (nanoprisms, nanorods, nanorings, among others). The EDS spectrum gave evidence of \nthe chemical composition of the synthesized nanoparticles. Optical absorption measurements \nshowed an absorption band characteristic of the  surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the silver \nnanoparticles. It has been found in several studies that the SPR can be more intense in non -\nspherical nanoparticles. Therefore, a multi -form nanoparticle solution could represent an \nadvantage.   The obtained na noparticles were incorporated in coatings, with the purpose of \ntaking advantage of the antimicrobial properties of AgNPs.   \nKeywords : Nanomaterial synthesis; Silver nanoparticles; Characterization of nanomaterials; \nbottom -up synthesis method; Surface plasmo n resonance (SPR)  \nAuthor for correspondence:  ricardoabritto@gmail.com  \nReference: Restrepo, C.

The strategies to reduce and control breast \ncancer have focused on its prevention, early detection, and treat ment. However, the current \ntreatments are neither capable to stop its propagation and/or recurrence on healthy cells. \nFurthermore, breast cancer treatments are not specific and harm healthy tissues and cells. It is \nwell known, that the activity of anticanc er drugs is greatly attenuated by the time drug reaches \nits target, which causes the ineffectiveness of the treatment and increase off -target effects. To \nachieve the effectiveness of breast cancer treatment it is necessary that the drug be \nadministered in the proper dosage and shows its maximum activity in cancer cells. Recently, \nthere has been an increasing number of scientific evidence that offer new alternatives for the \ndesign and development of novel anti -breast cancer drugs using desirable nanomaterial s that \nhave the capability of increasing local concentration of drugs in and around cancer cells, thereby \nreducing the potential toxicity toward healthy cells. Carbon -based nanomaterials are an \nemerging technology with promising applications in medicine, p articularly for detecting, \ndiagnosing, and treating breast cancer. Among the wide variety of carbon -based nanomaterials, \ngraphene is of particular interest to scientific community due to their ultra -high surface area, \nversatile chemical functionalization, biocompatibility, as well as its unique physical, chemical, \nand mechanical properties. Scientific evidence shows that graphene -based materials could \ninduce apoptosis in cancer cells while showing low toxicity due to their carbon structure. \nTherefore, these  materials can be used as nanodrugs, or biological carriers (nanocarriers) to \nintroduce small molecules such as nucleic acids or drugs into human cells to achieve treatment \ngoals.

In addition, there is global concern about the contamination of this vi tal \nliquid. Different techniques have been applied to treat contaminated water, among which \nadsorption and photocatalysis stand out, which together provide greater overall efficiency to the \nelimination of dyes and pharmaceuticals. In this work, BiOI -based nanocomposites (NCs) \ndecorated with graphene (G) and silver (Ag) were synthesized by solvothermal route: BiOI, \nG/BiOI, Ag/BiOI, Ag/G/BiOI. The NCs were characterized by several analytical techniques: XRD, \nzeta potential, N2 physisorption, photoluminescence , SEM, Raman, and UV -Vis DRS. The NCs \nexhibited micro flower -like morphology constituted by BiOI nanosheets and specific areas (SBET) \nbetween 55 and 63 m2/g. Adsorption and photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and \ntetracycline (TC) were studied. The as -synthesized NCs exhibited adsorption capacities of RhB \nand TC varied from 36 to 39 and from 83 to 86 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption capacities of \nTC on the NCs were higher than reported in the literature [1], and the G/BiOI NC presented the \nhighest sorpt ion capacity. The degradation percentages of RhB using NCs resulted in the interval \nof 86 - 100 % in 480 min, using 19 W white LEDs (SMD, 5050) as an illumination source. On the \nother hand, TC degradation varied from 70 to 81 % within 45 min of applying 10 0 W blue LEDs \n(COB) to irradiate the suspension. The Ag/BiOI NC exhibited the highest performance to degrade \nRhB and TC.  \nKeywords: BiOI, photocatalysis, adsorption, rhodamine B, tetracycline.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  esmeralda.mendoza@uaslp.mx  \nReference:  [1] R.

The presence of these pollutants in water represents a h ealth risk and is \nestimated to produce more than 500,000 deaths worldwide [1]. From the view of sustainable \ndevelo pment, the application of polluted water treatment technologies of low cost and high \nefficiency is vital. Heterogeneous photocatalysis, a semiconductor -based technology, is viable and \nconsidered green [2]. In the present work, bismuth vanadate nanostructures (BiVO 4-NEs) were \nsynthesized and decorated with Graphe ne (G) and Silver (Ag): BiVO 4, G/BiVO 4, Ag/BiVO 4 y G/Ag/BiVO 4 \nwith the aim of photodegrade dyes and photoinactivate bacteria. Physicochemical characterization \nof NEs was performed by different analytical techniques: XRD, TEM, Zeta Potential, N 2 physisorpti on, \nphotoluminescence, Raman, and UV -Vis DRS. The photodegradation of Violet Crystal (VC) and the \ninactivation of E. coli  were also studied. The NEs exhibited branched morphology and presented a \nrougher surface due to the deposited silver particles. XRD an alysis showed the BiVO 4 monoclinic \ncrystalline phase and crystallite sizes around 43 nm. The degradation percentage of VC achieved by \nNEs varied from 73 to 100 % within 180 min, using blue LEDs as the illumination source (19 W). The \nphotoinactivation of E.  coli (100%) was attained at 60 min of irradiation with Ag/BiVO 4 and by using \nG/Ag/BiVO 4 at 180 min. The NE that exhibited the highest performance in VC photodegradation and \nE. coli  inactivation was G/Ag/BiVO 4. Trapping experiments and reuse cycles were pe rformed to \ndetermine oxidative species that cause the VC photodegradation and E. coli  inactivation and evaluate \nthe possibility of NEs reuse.  \nKeywords:  BiVO 4; synthesis; photocatalysis; violet crystal; E. coli  photoinactivation.  \nReferences : [1]      M.

The synthesized NPs are pure and ligand fr ee. Among the \nadvantages of this technique we found: the experiment is simple, low cost and safe. For medical \nand biological applications, the NPs could be recovered with other semiconductor materials like \nsilicon oxide or zinc sulfide. To process cadmiun selenide (CdSe) nanoparticles, CdSe powder at \ndifferent concentrations was used in a constant volume of acetone (40 ml), in order to get a \ncolloidal solution. A Nd:YAG pulsed laser was used to irradiate the colloidal solutions during 30 \nminutes, a lens was  used to concentrate the energy in a focal spot. The laser was tuned in the \n3rd harmonic to get 355 nm wavelength, with 30 Hz of frequency. After samples irradiation, a \nchange in color was observed, the solution got homogeneous yellow tone that was increas ed \nwith the output power and the concentration of the CdSe powder. The transmittance specter \nwas taken with the Spectrometer Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 and the band gap shift was \nobserved.

We report the growth of In xGa 1\u2212xN/GaN \nquantum wells (QWs) in metastable -cubic phase (c -InxGa 1\u2212xN/GaN) by conventio nal Molecular \nBeam Epitaxy (conventional MBE) on GaAs (001) substrate. 10 nm -thick QWs with 30 nm -thick \nGaN barriers were grown. A chemical abruptness of the interfaces in these applications and a \nhomogeneous atomic distribution in the wells must be achiev ed. We used secondary ion mass \nspectroscopy (SIMS) to analyze these features in QWs grown. The In -depth profile of three c -\nnxGa 1\u2212xN QWs grown by conventional MBE was observed. Moreover, our studies provide \ninformation on the stable atomic arrangement of c -InxGa 1\u2212xN QWs by X -ray photoelectron \nspectrometry (XPS). With optical techniques, we studied the excitonic transitions in the visible \nspectrum range from 495 to 570 nm; these emissions were obtained in the green wavelengths \nfor QWs. These emissions are in good agreement with the theoretical calculations performed, \nwhere the excitonic binding energy was calculated according to the matricial model. Our work \ncan facilitate the design of the active region for LEDs.  \nKeywords: c-InxGa 1\u2212xN quantum wells, cubic -metastable phase.  \nAuthor for correspondence: marlene.camacho@cinvestav.mx  \nM.

Motivated by a constant stream \nof striking discoveries and also by the potential for, and realization of, new state -of-the-art \nelectronic device architectures the LDS encouraged lots of investigations during the past thirty \nyears. The semiconductor  quantum dots (QDs) are a particular LDS where the motion of \nelectrons is restricted to zero dimensions and likewise, novel physical properties are expected. \nHigh quality QDs can be self -assembled by employing deposition techniques like molecular \nbeam epit axy, and in order to develop QD -based devices further mechanism to successfully \nattack them must be investigated. To achieve this, it is necessary to have great control over the \ngrowth parameters, which is quite a challenging since diffusion, segregation, alloy intermixing, \nor strain effects are wholly involved. For this work, we use finite element methods feedbacked \nwith experimental observations to study the InAs QDs embedded in (Al)GaAs matrixes. \nExperimentally is observed that AlGaAs capping affects les s the morphology of the pyramidal \nislands, the QDs density is shortened and the WL thickness is thinner for the growth on GaAs \nsurfaces, as compared with Al containing surfaces. Considering the aforementioned results, the \nrelationship between strain energy  and electronic structure was investigated. \u03b5xx resulted more \naffected with the variations in the InAs QDs geometry, which agrees with changes in the behavior \npresented in heavy hole (HH) and light hole (LH) depending on whether we are under constant \nstrai n or there are changes in the structure between the simulated heterostructures. Also, we \ncan see some changes in the electronic transitions of the electrons and holes depending on the \ngeometry presented in the QD. Resulting in changes such as the confineme nt capacity \ndepending on the geometry of the QD.  \nKeywords: InAs -quantum dots, multi -stacked, strain distribution, diffusion parameters, critical \nthickness, band structure.  \nThe authors acknowledge the facilities granted by the Laboratorio Nacional de An\u00e1lisis Fisicos, \nQu\u00edmicos y Biol\u00f3gicos/UASLP, and financial support from FRC -UASLP, COPOCYT Fideicomiso \n23871 and CONACYT -Mexico.   \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n149  \n \n[ NSN -390 ] CONTROLED SYNTHESIS, CHARACTERIZATION AND \nPHOTOCATALYTIC APPLICATIONS OF ELECTROSPUN TIO2 NANOFIBERS \nOBTAINED FRO M DIFFERENT CHEMICAL PRECURSORS  \nOscar Secundino S \u00e1nchez (oscar.secundino@cinvestav.mx) 2 , Julio Gregorio Mendoza Alvarez 2 , \nPatricia Rodr \u00edguez Fragoso 2 , Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Guill \u00e9n Cervantes 2 , Joel D \u00edaz-Reyes 1 , Jose Francisco \nS\u00e1nchez Ramirez 1 , Jos\u00e9 Luis Herrera P \u00e9rez 3  \n1 Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  en Biotecnolog \u00eda Aplicada, Instituto Polit \u00e9cnico Nacional, Ex -Hacienda de \nSan Juan Molino, Km 1.5 de la Carretera Estatal Santa In \u00e9s Tecuexcomac -Tepetitla, Tepetitla, \nTlaxcala. 90700.

However, controlled assembly and \nregulating the gap between plasmonic metal NPs to achieve abundant \u00a8hot spots\u00a8 at the target \narea still remains a great challenge. In this work, we report a simple and versatile method for \ncontrolled assembly of Ag, Au and Ag/Au NPs networks onto surface of deep eutectic  solvents \n(DESs) using vacuum thermal evaporation technique. By varying the deposition parameters such \nas applied current and pressure inside the chamber, enables to modulation of Ag NPs size, \nshape, and density of Ag NPs assembly. The results demonstrate that the depsotion of Ag, Au \nand Au -Ag at high pressure (2x10-4 mbars), highly porous metallic and bimetallic NPs networks \nwere formed with controlled gaps. Moreover, the thickness of the films was also modulated by \nsimply varying the amont of Ag and Au metal wires used for deposition onto DESs. The resultant \nAg NPs assemblies exhibits abundant of SERS hot spots for highly sensitive detection of \nbiomolecules such as Rhodamine (R6G) and Crystal violet (CV).

Bacteria constantly mutate; \ntherefore, their defense mechanisms  mutate, as well. This leads to high mortality in patients \nwith infections and a high cost for the recovery of health. The projections for the future are not \nvery encouraging, which has led to consider antimicrobial resistance as a global health problem \nand to be the object of study by researchers. Nanotechnology plays a key role in antimicrobial \nresistance due to materials being modified at the nanometer scale, allowing large numbers of \nmolecules to assemble to have a dynamic interface. These nanomaterials  act as carriers, and \ntheir design is mainly focused on introducing the temporal and spatial release of the payload of \nantibiotics. By using nanoparticles as vehicles for the administration of antibiotics, either by \nencapsulating the antibiotic or by attac hing it to the surface of the nanoparticle, the \nantimicrobial can be protected from enzymes, molecules, or other agents that can degrade and \ndeactivate its effect. As an alternative to the problem, the synthesis of gold nanoparticles \nfunctionalized with am oxicillin (AuNPs@amox) has been developed, using the chemical \nreduction of Au+3 to Au0 generated by the amino groups of the antibiotic. That occurs by varying \nthe concentrations of the precursor agent (HAuCl 4) and the reducing agent (Amoxicillin, \nC16H19N3O5S), as well as the reaction time in the synthesis. In the characterization of \nAuNPs@amox, UV -Vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to \ndetermine their morphology, size, and elemental composition. Quasi -spherical gold \nnanoparticle s with a bimodal behavior were obtained, with a size distribution between 15 -20 \nnm for the large ones and 1 -2 nm for the small ones.  \nKeywords:  AuNPs, antibiotic, antimicrobial resistance, functionalization, nanotechnology.  \nAuthor for correspondence: hilda. esparza@cimav.edu.mx  \nThis work was supported by: CONACYT.   \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n152  \n \n[ NSN -72 ] EFFECT OF STRAIN ON SURFACE PLASMON OF \nGRAPHENE EMBEDDED IN ONE -DIMENSIONAL PHOTONIC \nCRYSTAL.  \nLuis \u00c1ngel Galeana G \u00f3mez (luis.galeana@cinvestav.mx) 1 , Gerardo Acacio Gonz \u00e1lez de la Cruz \n(bato@fis.cinvestav.mx) 1  \n1 Departamento de F \u00edsica, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  y Estudios Avanzados del IPN, Av.

The effect of the indium myristate \nprecursor concentration on the optical, structural properties InP@ZnS QDs was studied. By X -\nray diffraction (XRD) were sh own the presence of zincblende crystalline phases of the InP and \nZnS and was estimated the InP@ZnS QDs size with Scherrer -Debye equation, which was ranging \nfrom 3.75 to 9.72 nm as confirmed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR -\nTEM). It w as found a color variation of the InP@ZnS QDs in solution due to the quantum \nconfinement effects when the nanoparticle sizes are smaller than the exciton Bohr radius. The \nbandgap energy of the QD was determined from the absorption spectra, finding that it depends \non the myristate concentration, which was ranged from 2.90 -3.21 eV. In addition, an enhanced \nPL emission was obtained due to a passivation effect on the ZnS -covered InP QDs. In the \nphotoluminescence (PL) spectra at room temperature, emission peaks were observed in the \nrange of 2.19 to 2.91 eV.

Each sample was covered \nwith different nanoparticles on the surface. Two different types of nanoparticles with different \nsizes were used. We have two oxides: TiO 2 (21 nm) and MnO (50 nm). Each sample was placed \nin a steel hearth box with a lid, each box, in turn, was introduced into a muffle to carry out heat \ntreatment at 950\u00b0C for 24 hours. After this time and without low the muffle temperature, each \nof the boxes with every sample was removed the muffle t o implement a cooling process by not \nsevere thermal shock at room temperature. A surface layer of iron oxide, and nanoparticles, was \nformed on each plate; these layers were ground in a ceramic mortar to obtain powders, which \nwere characterized using the X -ray diffraction technique to find the phases present in these \nlayers. Semiquantitative phase analysis was obtained using HighScore Plus software. As a result, \nthe reaction between nanoparticles and the steel surface at 950\u00b0C gave us different percentages \nof iron oxides such as FeO, Fe 2O3, and Fe 3O4. We obtained non -stoichiometric Fe compounds \nand others with different crystallography and composition according to the different \nnanoparticles used in the process.

The understanding of these processes will \nallow us to design effective thermal treatments. In this work, we study experimentally the \ninterdiffusion zone behavior at 800\u00b0C by means of a diffusion couple of Ni80Cr2 0 and Cu70Ni30 \nbinary alloys. The Cu -Ni binary alloy is an ideal isomorphic system, however, the addition of a \nthird alloying element such as Cr introduces an immiscibility gap that makes these alloys \nsusceptible to heat treatment. Diffusion -couples were s olution treated at 1000\u00b0C for 100 h and \nthen water -quenched subsequently aged at 800\u00b0C for 0.5 h. Interdiffusion zone was analyzed by \nHRTEM, SEM and nanohardness measurements. Linear EDS -SEM permitted to obtain the \nconcentration profile showing the differe nce in chromium composition in the CuNi region. \nHRTEM showed the change in size and volume of the nanoparticles in the interdiffusion zone \nduring aging. Nanohardness values indicated hardening during isothermal aging due to the \npresence of chromium -rich ma nometric precipitates in the interdiffusion zone.  \nKeywords : Diffusion -couples, isothermal aging, precipitates and concentration profile.  \nThis work was supported by  SIP project 20221932 and CNMN -IPN \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n156  \n \n[ NSN -254 ]  FABRICATION OF ENCAPSULATED ZEOLITE \nPOLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE NANOFIBERS  \nDaniela Barrera Guti \u00e9rrez (barrera.gutierrez.daniela@gmail.com) 3 , Edgar Miguel Res \u00e9ndiz Jim \u00e9nez 3 \n, Susana Meraz D \u00e1vila (smerazdav@gmail.com) 3 , Gerardo Arreola Jard \u00f3n 3 , Claudia Elena P \u00e9rez \nGarc \u00eda 2 , Rafael Ram \u00edrez Bon 1  \n1 Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  y de Estudios Avanzados del IPN, Unidad Quer \u00e9taro, Libramiento \nNorponiente #2000, Fracc.

Furthermore, in the form of \nnanostructures, III -N alloys emit light very efficiently [1]. However, the mecha nism of \nincorporation of indium atoms in III -N compounds is still poorly understood. For this reason, in \nthis work we studied the indium incorporation in InxGa1 -xN and InxAl1 -xN nanostructures \nembedded in Ga(Al)N barriers grown by molecular beam epitaxy (M BE) on Si(111) substrates. \nThe Si substrates were cleaned by the Ishizaka -Shiraki method [2] and then introduced into de \nMBE system. In order to obtain high -quality III -N epilayers on Si substrate, an AlN buffer layer \nwas used to reduce the lattice and the rmal mismatch with Si, this AlN buffer also prevents the \nformation of an amorphous SiN layer at the interface. We studied the effect of varying the \ngrowth temperature on the concentration of indium in the InGaN and InAlN nanostructures. The \nIn concentratio n in the samples was obtained by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The \nstructural properties were studied by x -ray diffraction (XRD), secondary electron microscopy \n(SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The optical properties of the nanostructures were \nevaluated by photoreflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopy.  \n[1] M.Camacho -Reynoso et. al J.

The present work describes the methodology to sy nthesize hexagonal \nnanotubes of molybdenum trioxide (NT -h:MoO 3) and their characterization. It was found an \nenhanced methylene blue (MB) degradation under light irradiation as a function of the NT\u00b4s \namount. In particular, we used 10 and 20 mg of NT -h:MoO 3. Moreover, for 20 mg of NT\u00b4s \nalthough the MB degradation is favored even at 20 min of irradiation, we could observe in the \nUV-Vis absorption spectra evidence of the generation of sub -products during the photocatalytic \nprocess.

A lot of methods for production of Ag NP\u00b4s are based on the reduction of silver \nnitrate (AgNO 3) and the use of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to preven t agglomerates. The effect of \nPVP solution aging in the sintesis of Ag NP\u00b4s has not been investigated. For this reason, in this \nwork a follow -up of the effect of PVP aging; for which PVP was dissolved in water and the NP's \nwere prepared with aged solution for 0, 2, 4 and 8 days. Absorption spectra were obtained by \nUV-vis spectroscopy in the range of 300 -800 nm. In all the samples the presence of the plasmon \ncentered around 400 -450 nm with an approximate FWHM of 220 nm. The absortion spectra \nshow that the si gnal corresponding to the plasmon is asymmetric, which could be associated \nwhith the presence of spherical Ag NP\u00b4s with different sizes. It was observed that the intensity \nof peak of Plamon absorption increases as the PVP solution ages. By Scanning electro n \nmicroscopy (SEM) show an Ag NP's distribution of different sizes between 40 -100 nm, which is \nconsistent with that observed by UV -vis spectroscopy.  \n[1] A. \u00c1valos, AI.

Once SGNs are located in the desired area, they e levate their temperature while \nirradiated with NIR laser. The scattering and dispersion coefficients of human skin, \nsubcutaneous and mucous tissues are reduced when the wavelength of the irradiation is \nbetween 600 -1300nm, which allows for the laser to acce ss the location of the SGNs without \naffecting any tissue. NIR irradiation will then turn into heat which could be used for \nhyperthermia and/or the localized release of drugs. Because of the wide range of possible \napplications for the SGNs, this work presen ts the optimization of their synthesis method. The \nsilica cores were synthesized using the St\u00f6ber method, and the gold nanoparticles were \ndeposited over the cores by modifying the method presented by Kah. These modifications \nreduced the synthesis time by 8 3%, and even though the gold nanoparticles only cover the core \npartially, the photo -thermal properties were kept. The silica core and gold semi -shell dimensions \nwere evaluated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The cores have \na diameter of 62\u00b15nm with a gold semi -shell of \u22483nm. To compare the photo -thermal efficiency \nof a semi -shell with a full -shell, SGNs were also synthesized with a core of 62\u00b15nm and a full \ngold shell of \u22485nm. Both nanostructures were irradiated with laser of  852 nm 3.2mW, and the \ntemperature changes were recorded with a thermal imager. The nanostructures increased their \ntemperature by 36 C and 37 C for the semi -shell and the full -shell, respectively. This increment \nin temperature is sufficient to induce necro sis on cancerous cells, as well as to induce localized \ndrug release, which would significantly reduce the side effects of conventional treatments.    \nKeywords: Silica -gold nanostructures, photo -thermal ablation, NIR  \nAuthor for correspondence: rosa.ruvalcaba @cimav.edu.mx  \nReference:  [1] A.

There still great interest to conduct basic research on QDs \nadvantageous properties, which include the mechanisms of high quantum yield, high \nphotostability, high molar extinction coefficients, collective elect ron spin manipulation, among \nothers. Additionally, their unique quantum properties like increased density of states and energy \nlevel discretization conduces to significant advantages when applied to electronic and \noptoelectronic devices. Self -assembling vi a strain relaxation is the main mechanism of synthesis \nto be considered for such applications and to obtain effective experimental QDs devices is \nnecessary to grow a successful vertical stacked QDs in the active region of the devices. \nNevertheless, structu ral parameters get more challenging as each layer of QDs is added since \nthe strain itself boost no -desired processes of surface diffusion, segregation between layers and \nalloy intermixing. In this work, the strain distribution during the multistacking of Q Ds layers is \nstudied. We have tailored the InAs adatoms mobility by changing the layer over which they are \nself-assembled, i.e. either GaAs or AlGaAs. The reduced mobility of In adatoms conduced to \nlarger QDs density relieving the interface strain.  On the  other hand, by changing the capping \nmaterial, an important interfaces diffusion takes place, presumably related with strain \nredistribution. When are covered by AlGaAs the QDs are less affected in comparison with the \nGaAs capping, preserving the morphology  and avoiding materials alloying. Lastly, asymmetric \nhigh -resolution x -ray scans were performed to evaluate the residual strain in the whole stacked \nheterostructure.  \nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of CONACYT -Mexico and the Cathedra\u2019s \nCONACYT  Program, the laboratorio nacional de an\u00e1lisis f\u00edsicos, qu\u00edmicos y biol\u00f3gicos de la \nUASLP, and COPOCyT through Fideicomiso 23871.    \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n164  \n \n[ NSN -33 ] INCORPORATION OF SILVER NANOPARTICLES INTO \nSiO2 FILMS  \nMontserrat de los \u00c1ngeles Romero Ch \u00e1vez (angeles_march@hotmail.com) 1 , Idania Del Alba Montero 3 , Martha \nE.

Their \ncharacteristics make them good candidates for use in applications rangin g from solar cell, \nstorage devices and fuel cell. However, there is still no low -cost and energy -saving route to \nobtain perovskite -type materials. Fast chemistry has emerged as an alternative for obtaining \nhigh -purity and industrially scalable materials. H ere, some methods such as combustion and \nmolten salts can be assisted by microwaves, obtaining   excelent electrochemical properties. In \nthis work, the chemical synthesis of lanthanum manganite (LaMnO 3) by the combustion and \nmolten salts methods assisted by  microwaves is presented. The perovskites obtained were \ncharacterized by X -ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X -ray \ndiffraction allowed us to identify the cubic -type crystal structure (PDF 75 -0440) and \northorhombic -type crystal s tructure (PDF 89 -0682) for the perovskites sintethized by \ncombustions and molten salts, respectively. Crystallite sizes were ~15nm for the cubic phase \nand ~24 nm for the orthorhombic phase. Results showed that the microwave -assisted chemical \nsynthesis of t he LaMnO 3 perovskite offered energy and time savings compared with the \ntraditional chemical methods. The electrochemical properties for   oxygen reduction (ORR) and \noxygen evolution (OER) reactions were assessed.  \nKeywords:  Perovskite, LaMnO 3 ,combustion,  molten salts,  microwaves.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  lejandragredo@uaz.edu.mx  \nThis work was supported by:  beca maestr\u00eda (CVU:1164985)  CONACyT y proyecto 67 c\u00e1tedras \nCONACyT.   \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n168  \n \n[ NSN -196 ]  MICROWAVE ASSISTED SYNTHESIS OF CARBON \nQUANTUM DOTS AND ITS ABSORPTION/EMISSION \nCHARACTERIZATION  \nJos\u00e9 Luis Luna -S\u00e1nchez (jluis.lunas@gmail.com) 4 , Jos\u00e9 Luis Jim \u00e9nez-P\u00e9rez \n(jimenezp@fis.cinvestav.mx) 4 , Salvador Fernando Arvizu -Amador 4 , Usiel Omar Garc \u00eda-Vidal 4 , \nGenaro L \u00f3pez-Gamboa 2 , Zormy Nacary Correa -Pacheco 1 , Rub \u00e9n Guti \u00e9rrez-Fuentes 3  \n1 Centro de Desarrollo de Productos Bi \u00f3ticos, Instituto Polit \u00e9cnico Nacional, Carretera Yautepec -\nJojutla km 6, San Isidro, Yautepec, Morelos 62731, Mexico  \n2 Tecnol \u00f3gico Nacional de M \u00e9xico Campus Toluca, direcci \u00f3n Avenida Tecnol \u00f3gico s/n.

Nanostructures like nanotubes, fullerene, graphene and nanodiamonds have \nbeen found to possess extraordinary physico -chemical properties. On the other hand, Carbon \nQuantum Dots (CQD) stand out by their optical and biochemical properties that make them \noptimal candidates for applications like bioimaging and biosensors. Still far from optimized \napplications, the CQD synthesis and characterization is an area of intensive research; great \ndiversity of methods and precursors are being tested and a wide variation of properties is being \ndiscovered. In this work, a green method was employed to synthesize CQD. Dextrose/water \nsolution (11.1 w %) was used as pr ecursor, energy was dosed as microwaves to the reactor, and \nthe reaction time was between 2 and 10 min. UV -vis spectroscopy was used as a first approach \nto characterize the products. Transmision electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine \ntheir dimensi on, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to confirm the \nfunctional groups -C=C-, -CO, \u2013OH, -COOH, that are expected to conform the synthesized \nnanostructures. Thermal lens (TL) and photoluminescence (PLS) spectroscopy will be used to \ndetermine the quantum efficiency and yield. As the synthesis was performed in aqueous media, \nwith a biocompatible precursor that generates no other chemical groups than the listed before, \nthis research is expected to generate highly biocompatible CQD, to be c onfirmed.  \nKeywords: Quantum Dots, Green synthesis, Biocompatibility.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  jimenezp@fis.cinvestav.mx  \nThis work was supported by:  SIP project, COFAA and CONACYT   \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n169  \n \n[ NSN -415 ] MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXIAL GROWTH OF GANAS \nMULTI -QUANTUM WELL HET EROSTRUCTURES.  \nRolando Pinson Ortega (a300477@alumnos.uaslp.mx) 4 , Leticia Espinosa Vega 2 , Fernanda Mora Herrera 4 , Jos\u00e9 \nEspinoza Figueroa 4 , Alfredo Belio Manzano 2 , Pablo Olvera Enr \u00edquez 2 , Maximiliano Villarreal Faz 4 , Lendy \nHern \u00e1ndez Gayt \u00e1n 2 , Felipe Perea Parrales 2 , Cristo Yee Rend \u00f3n 3 , Luis Cuellar Camacho 4 , Irving Cortes Mestizo \n1 , V\u00edctor M \u00e9ndez Garc \u00eda 4 , V\u00edctor M \u00e9ndez Garc \u00eda (victor.mendez@uaslp.mx) 2  \n1 CONACYT -Center for the Innovation and Application of Science and technology , Universidad Aut \u00f3noma de San \nLuis Potos \u00ed (UASLP), Av.

Up to now, the highest conversion efficiencies have been \nachieved with tandem or multi -junction SCs, technologies that comprise the simultaneous \nabsorption of photons of d ifferent wavelengths. This strategy allows for capturing a broader \nregion of the solar spectra, as compared to conventional solar cells based on single pn junctions. \nAn alternative approach to achieve the multi -wavelength photon absorption is throughout \nhighly mismatched alloys (HMA) like GaNAs. For this material the decoupling in electronegativity \nand size of the atomic radii of the N with Ga, generates a splitting conduction band (CB) letting \nunaltered the balance band (VB). The low and high energy CBs af ter splitting have been called \nas minus ( -) and plus (+) bands, respectively. Thus, in a single layer three different transitions are \nallowed: VB \u2192CB\u2013, VB\u2192CB+ and CB \u2013\u2192CB+. In this work, a novel quantum well heterostructure \nis proposed to further increase th e quantity of electronic transitions.  The GaNAs HMA alloy was \nsandwiched between AlGaAs barriers with mole fraction  xAl from 0 to1 to selectively achieve the \nconfinement of CB+  and/or CB \u2013. 3d finite element model was employed to determine the \nconfinement quantum states. Simulations indicated that some eigenfunctions of both bands are \noverlapped depending on the AlGaAs barriers. Conversely, in spite that the activation of bands \nwas corroborated by photoreflectance spectroscopy, there was not clear evidence of quantum \nconfined states related with CB+, suggesting that CB - is the sole energy band that contributes to \nthe electron confinement. The experimental -theoretical controversy is explained in terms of the \ndeallocation of the impurity levels of N in the hos t matrix.  \nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of CONACYT -Mexico and the Cathedra\u2019s \nCONACYT Program, the laboratorio nacional de an\u00e1lisis f\u00edsicos, qu\u00edmicos y biol\u00f3gicos de la \nUASLP, and COPOCyT through Fideicomiso 23871.   \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n170  \n \n[ NSN -21 ] N 1S CORE -LEVEL BINDING ENERGIES IN NITROGEN -\nDOPED CARBON NANOTUBES: A COMBINED EXPERIMENTAL \nAND THEORICAL STUDY.  \nGabriella Azuara Tuexi (gabriellacerati11@gmail.com) 1 , Ricardo Alberto Guirado Lopez \n(guirado@ifisica.uaslp.mx) 2  \n1 Coordinaci \u00f3n para la Innovaci \u00f3n y Aplicaci \u00f3n de la Ciencia y la Tecnolog \u00eda (CIACYT), Universidad \nAut\u00f3noma de San Luis Potos \u00ed (UASLP), Av.

N -CNTs were \nsynthesized using the CVD technique, and then subjected to acid treatments (nitric and sulfuric \nacid) yielding multiwalled carbon nanotubes with functional groups, which were characterized \nby scanning and transmission  electron microscopy of the which we obtained appreciable images \nof carbon nanotubes with diameters around 70 -90 nm and lengths of 200 \u00b5m, were also \ncharacterized by RAMAN, SEM, TEM and XPS microscopy. Extensive density functional theory \n(DFT) calculations  are performed on various single and double -walled N -CNT models where the \nCLBEs of N 1 are determined using Koopman's theorem. However, peak deconvolution is \ncharacterized by five broad Gaussian curves that overlap considerably with each other, with \ndiffer ent widths and heights, implying a more complex distribution of N atoms within CNTs. DFT \ncalculations reveal a strong dependence of CLBE values on the local atomic environment. The \nabove distributions of theoretical CLBEs also overlap strongly, implying th at some peaks in the \nXPS spectra must be understood as composite signals where the coexistence of different N \ndefects is present. We found, in agreement with the experimental data, that the independent \nmolecular nitrogen and the encapsulated (weakly intera cting) N2 within the hollow core of \nmodel CNTs have very similar CLBEs. In addition, we predict that the chemisorbed N2 in the \ndefect regions of the nanotube walls, as well as the intercalated (highly confined) nitrogen \nmolecules between the carbon layers,  have N1s binding energy values that are considerably \nhigher compared to N1s. with the N2 encapsulated, which makes its identification possible.   \nKEYWORDS:  Carbon nanotubes, XPs and  Koopman's theorem.   \nAuthor for correspondence:  guirado@ifisica.uaslp.mx  \nREFERENCE:  Mihai V.

The \nphotocatalytic activity is affected by BiW content in heterojunctions. Besides, silver nano particles \n(Ag-NPs) and graphene (G) were loaded to 1BiW/1BiV heterojunction. The Ag/1BiW/BiV \nheterojunction is constituted by plate and spherical -like particles of BiV and BiW, respectively. \nTEM studies confirmed the junction zone between BiV, BiW, and Ag -NPs in Ag/BiW/1BiV. The P25 \n(TiO 2) exhibited lower photocatalytic activity than Ag/1BiW/1BiV. The rhodamine B (RhB) \ndegradation (%X RhB) over Ag/1BiW/BiV reached 100% within 210 min under blue LEDs irradiation. \nBesides, the RhB degradation is dependent on t he initial dye concentration and catalyst dosage. \nThe scavenger tests revealed that the main oxidative species inducing the RhB degradation were \nh+ and \u2022O2\u2212, and the carrier transfer mechanism in Ag/1BiW/1BiV was postulated.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to synthesize and characterize silver \nnanoparticles (NpAg) using the so -called green synthesis, which is effectiv e, simple and low cost, \nwith the advantage that it has a friendly environmental impact. This green synthesis was made \nfrom nopal mucilage (Opuntia ficus -indica), which was extracted and filtered, and used as a \nprecursor for the nanoparticles. For the synth esis, 0.2 g of cactus extract were used, which were \ndissolved in 80 ml of deionized water and a 5mM AgNO 3 solution. The Ag/Mucilage solution was \nmixed using a temperature of 60 \u00baC for 30 min. The solution turned from clear to brown, which \nwas indicative of  NpAg formation. Subsequently, the solution was dried at 100\u00b0C and then \nexposed to 500\u00b0C. The NpAg were characterized both in aqueous solution and in powder form, \nthrough UV -Vis spectroscopy techniques. The results showed that a plasmon resonance was \nprese nt around 430 nm, attributed to the Ag particles.

Tijuana -\nEnsenada km107,  \nRecently, the catalysts based on bimetallic nanoparticles confined in metal oxides have become attractive \nin applications such as photodegradation of organic dyes, hydrogen production  and catalytic reduction of \nnitroaromatic compounds. However, the synthesis of these catalysts is arduous and commonly involves \nmore than three stages [1]. In this work, we present the microwave -assisted one -pot synthesis of catalysts \nbased on mono and bimetall ic nanoparticles (Au, AuAg and AuCu) confined into the oxides: Fe 2O3, TiO 2 and \nCeO 2. The physicochemical properties of obtained samples were studied using STEM, XRD, UV -Vis \nspectroscopy, DLS and Z potential techniques. Results confirmed the effective forma tion of oxides matrix \ncapping metallic nanoparticles, characterized by quasispherical shape and sizes between 200 to 400 nm. \nIn addition, catalytic activity and stability were evaluated using the reduction of nitrophenol isomers in situ \nmonitored by in -situ UV -Vis spectroscopy. The catalytic activity depends on the composition of the catalyst \nas well as the reagent molecule (2 -, 3- and 4 -nitrophenol). The Au -M@TiO 2 and Au -M@Fe 2O3 catalysts were \nstable up to 5 catalytic cycles in reducing 4 -nitrophenol to 4 -aminophenol. These results highlight the \ndevelopment of a one -pot methodology for nanomaterials synthesis with catalytic performance \ncomparable to their reference supported catalysts, commonly presented in the literature.  \nKeywords : Bimetallic -nanoparticles , Nanoreactor, nitroaromatic -reduction  brenda.acosta@uaslp.mx  \nReferences : [1] Yang F, Wu C, Yu H, Wang S, Li T, Yan B, Yin H.

Two types of substrates  are used in \nthis research YSZ 3% mol and YSZ 8% mol. GDC/SDC and SDC/GDC thin films were grown on \nthese substrates by cathodic -erosion utilizing a radio frequency source for one hour.   The charge \ntransport was measured in four different fuel cells. For al l the cells, the anode used was NiO \n(60%) \u2013 Ce0.9Gd 0.1O2 and for the cathode La 0.8Sr0.2MnO 3 (50%) \u2013 Ce0.9Gd 0.1O2.

The cells were formed \nusing a co -linear geometry, i.e, the anode and cathode deposited by screen -printing parallel to \neach other and separated by \u22481 mm of electrolyte. The cells were fed with methane gas and air. \nThe electrolytes grown on YSZ 3% mol substrates reached a thickness of 100 nm, while those \ngrown on YS Z 8% mol increased in thickness by 50% (150 nm).

It was observed that the photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction activated  \nwith visible light ( \u03bb > 420nm), is better in the samples that contain the BiOBr/BiOCl combination, \nobtaining the activity peak when using the molar ratio of the halogen BiOCl with respect to the \nBiOBr of 25 % (0.25:0.75 respectively), obtaining a degradat ion constant k = 0.143 s-1. This can \nbe explained by the interaction between the n -type (ZnO) and p -type (BiOX) semiconductors that \nfavor an effective separation of the photogenerated exciton ( ) and the effective transfer of \ncharge between the BiOCl and B iOBr, this results in a significant increase in the lifetime of the \nphotogenerated species.

In this work, we find a way to remove pollutants from water, taking into \naccount the surface affinity of pseudoboehmite. Considering this affinity with polluting \nmolecules, of an organic type, such as sodium citrate, the synthesis of pseudoboehmite and gold \nnanoparticles coated with sodium citrate was carried  out. The synthesis of pseudoboehmite was \nfrom a solution of aluminum sulfate (Al 2(SO 4)) and ammonia gas (NH 3), while nanoparticles were \nsynthesized from a concentration of chlorine auric acid (HAuCl 4), deionized water, and sodium \ncitrate. After that, pseu doboehmite was mixed at different concentrations with gold \nnanoparticles coated with sodium citrate for its characterization using X -ray diffraction \ntechnique and UV -Vis spectrometry. It was concluded that pseudoboehmite adsorbs the sodium \ncitrate removing  successfully this contaminant from water, being an easy and not expensive \noption to produce with the same result with other types of pollutant organic molecules.  \nKey Words: Pseudoboehmite, organic molecules, wastewater, gold nanoparticles, pollution, \nsodi um citrate  \nAuthor for correspondence: danielcv87@gmail.com  \nReferences : Auxilio, A.R. et al.

The \nversatility of this tech nique to stablish optical configurations to align the electric field of the \nelectromagnetic wave of excitation and detection adds the capability of gathering information \nof the symmetry and order/disorder of the molecular structure of the samples. In parti cular, \nwhen applied to study semiconductor nanostructures assembled on high index crystallographic \nplanes, the Raman spectra comprises information related to the near surface anisotropy due to \nthe unidimensional (1D) arrangement, strain and lattice disorde r. In this work we studied the \nstructural properties of AlGaAs/GaAs (631) high electronic mobility transistors (HEMTS) grown \nby molecular beam epitaxy. The intrinsic anisotropic and kinetic properties of the (631) plane \nallow the self -assembling of 1D quan tum wires (QWs) whose geometry essentially depends on \nthe growth temperature and III/V molecular beam fluxes ratio. However, the n -type doping \nnecessary for devices like HEMTs takes place at substrate temperatures where the 1D order is \nnot allowed. Therefo re, we explore tin impurification of the AlGaAs barrier of the device to \novercome this issue. In order to determine the crystal properties due to the Sn incorporation \nthe parallel and perpendicular directions to the corrugations was evaluated, which corres pond \nto the Z(XX) -Z and Z(YY) -Z RS configurations, where X=[ -113] and Y=[ -8 19 -9]. The RS analysis \nshows a clear dependence of the L - intensity located at 256 cm-1 with the Sn doping, while the \nlattice disorder occasioned by the impurity changes the GaAs -like LO/TO intensity ratio, getting \nfurther from the ideal ratio depicted by the Raman selection rules.

Assuming that graphene is a strictly \n2D material, generalized Fresnel coefficients are derived as a function of the incident angles and \nthe anisotropic in -plane optical conductivity of graphene. As an  application, our general findings \nare particularized for uniform strained graphene. Effectsa uniaxial strain on plasmon modes and \nthe reflectance are performed as a function of the magnitude and direction of the strain.  \nKeywords: Reflectivity, Graphene, S train  \nA. G.

This work presents the synthesis of NdFeO 3 with perovskite -type structure by a simple, \neconomic and reproducible method. The crystal structure, surface morphology, composition, and particle \nsize were analyzed by X -ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron \nmicroscopy. Microwave radiati on was applied for solvent evaporation. The thermal decomposition of the \nprecursors leads to the formation of NdFeO 3. The oxide was synthesized at 800 \u00b0C and crystallized in an \northorhombic structure with cell parameters a = 5.58, b = 7.76 and c = 5.45 \u00c5, space group Pnma (62). The \nperovskite\u00b4s surface shows a fibrous appearance due to a continuous connectivity between particles, \ngenerating cavities among them.

Starting with the NdFeO 3 synthesized powders, \npellets were made and tested as gas sensors in propane and carbon monoxide gases. The nanoparticles \nwere clearly sensitive to the studied gases at concentrations  of 0\u2013300 ppm, and temperatures of 25, 100, \n200, and 300 \u00b0C.

For example, in the fabrication of \nAlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures which are widely used in the fabrication of b ipolar transistors or \nMOSFETs; the doping is usually incorporated as modulated doping. However, this modulated \ndoping of the active layers could introduce crystal defects that negatively affect the performance \nof the electronic devices. On the other hand, the use of low -dimensional systems such as wires \nor quantum wells has shown to be of great interest to further improve the performance of \ndifferent devices. In this work, a study was carried out on the crystalline quality of samples grown \nas a function of the growth temperature, from 640 to 720 \u00b0C of the GaAs active layer. The \nsamples were fabricated by Molecular Beam Epitaxy using GaAs (631) and (100) substrates to \ninduce the formation of corrugated (with different uniformity) and non -corrugated interfaces  in \nGaAs wells inside AlGaAs barriers. The structural characterization was carried out by HRDRX, \nAFM, and Raman spectroscopy. The samples (100), in which abrupt interfaces are expected, to \nchange very little, which is consistent with what has already been reported. On the other hand, \nthe literature tells us that the surface morphology of the (631) samples varies strongly with \ntemperature [1], our sample with a temperature of 690 \u00b0C presents surface corrugation \nindicative of 1D systems (Quantum Wires) which is important for applications and the study of \nunique effects in this type of system. The results indicate a similar or even better crystalline \nquality for both, the GaAs and AlGaAs films, as compared with others reports using a modulated \ndoping.  \nKeywords:  Quantum Wire, GaAs, HRDRX, Raman.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  elihuhazels@yahoo.com.mx  \n[1] E.

The investigations are being studied with the aim of improving its physical \nchemical  properties and thus improve the catalytic performance.  \nIn this work we report a simple way to synthesize manganese ferrite (MnFe 2O4) nanostructures \nby the coprecipitation method, using Fe chloride and Mn sulfate as metal precursors, and \u03b2-\ncyclodextrin ( \u03b2-CD) acting as coating agent. Synthesis was accompanied by the hydrothermal \nmethod at different temperatures 120 and 140 \u00b0C for 24 h. These samples were named as \u03b2-CD-\nMnFe 2O4. For comparison, pure MnFe 2O4 was also prepared by a similar procedure, without the \naddition of \u03b2-CD. \nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the \u03b2-CD-MnFe 2O4 sample prepared without a reactor and the \nsample at 120\u00b0C indicated little crystallinity of the material, while the sample at 140\u00b0C indicated \nthe presence of a single phase. crystal corresponding to MnFe 2O4. The crystallite size of these \nsamples increased  with temperature from 2.7 nm to 4.7 nm. On the other hand, the sample \nobtained at 140\u00b0C is mesoporous with a high value of specific surface area 240 m 2g -1. The XRD \nof the samples without cyclodextrin showed good crystallinity at all synthesized temperatu res, \nhowever, the size of the crystallite was 23 nm, much larger than the samples obtained with \ncyclodextrin.  \nIn the degradation of methylene blue, the samples obtained with cyclodextrin presented a better \ncatalytic performance than pure MnFe 2O4 in terms o f activation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) to \ndegrade methylene blue (AM) at neutral pH. The results indicate that \u03b2-CD-MnFe 2O4 is promising \nfor the degradation of organic species in aqueous systems, overcoming the disadvantages of \npure MnFe 2O4. \nKeywords: Nanoparticles,  methylene blue, manganese ferrite, cyclodextrin  \nAuthor for correspondence:   lluza@unsa.edu.pe  \nReference:   Zhou X, Kong L, Jing Z, et al.

To date, Co Mn 2O4 has been little studied in \nthe field of gas sensor. Therefore, in this work we synthesized, characterized, and investigated \nthe detection properties of nanostructured cobalt manganite. CoMn 2O4 was synthesized by a \nsimple microwave -assisted colloidal method. The samples obtained were characterized by X -ray \ndiffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and ultraviolet -visible \nspectroscopy. The crystalline phase of CoMn 2O4 was obtained at a calcination temperature of \n400 \u00b0C, while the mai n Raman vibration bands confirmed the spinel structure of cobalt \nmanganite. The surface morphology of CoMn 2O4 revealed a porous microstructure with \nirregularly shaped pores, and a particle size distribution ranging from 30 to 100 nm was \nestimated. In addition, three characteristic absorption bands of CoMn 2O4 were located at 314, \n631, and 680 nm. Detection measure ments showed that CoMn 2O4 is sensitive to ethanol in the \nrange of 10 to 50 ppm at an operating temperature of 185 \u00b0C with a stable, reproducible, and \nrepeatable response. The decrease in resistance of CoMn 2O4 in the presence of ethanol \nindicated n -type sem iconductor behavior. Due to the good detection performance of the \nnanostructured CoMn 2O4, it could be used as a sensor to detect ethanol.  \nKeywords:  Cobalt manganite, nanoparticles, gas sensor, ethanol  \nAuthor for correspondence: david.poot@alumnos.udg.mx  \nReference : [1] H.

A simple methodology \nhas been developed to synthesize these nanoferrous particles, using the precipitation method \nfor Fe 3O4 NPs. They were c haracterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), UV -\nvis spectroscopy and X -ray diffraction (XRD). A laser was used to heat and recorded using a \nthermal camera to know their behavior. For such applications, an important parameter is \nthermal c onductivity as a function of nanoferrous concentration and nanoparticle size, using the \nthermal wave resonant cavity characterization (TWRC) technique. The experimental data were \nfitted to various classical models such as the Maxwell model and the neural n etwork model to \ndescribe the thermal conductivity of nanoferrous metals. These investigations have immediate \napplications in drug transport and imaging   (1). \nKeywords: magnetic nanoparticles, nanofluids, biomedicine, characterization  \nAuthor for correspondence: jimenezp@fis.cinvestav.mx  \nReference:  Ghazanfari MR, Kashefi M, Shams SF, Jaafari MR., Biochem Res Int. 2016, (2016). \nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2016/7840161  \nThis work has been supported by:  SIP project, COFAA and CONACYT  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n205  \n \n[NSN -202 ] THERMO -OPTICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF \nCARBONIZED POLYACRYLONITRILE (PAN) NANOFIBERS AND \nEXFOLIATION OF FIBERS FOR DETERMINATION OF QUANTUM \nEFFICIENCY  \nOrlando Zaca -Mor\u00e1n (orlandozaca@hotmail.com) 2 , Genaro L \u00f3pez-Gamboa 3 , Jos\u00e9 Luis Jim \u00e9nez-\nP\u00e9rez (jimenezp@fis.cinvestav.mx) 4 , Jos\u00e9 Francisco S \u00e1nchez -Ram \u00edrez 2 , Zormy Nacary Correa -\nPacheco 1  \n1 Centro de Desarrollo de Productos Bi \u00f3ticos, Instituto Polit \u00e9cnico Nacional, Carretera Yautepec -\nJojutla km 6, San Isidro, Yautepec, Morelos 62731, Mexico.  \n2 Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  en Biotecnolog \u00eda Aplicada, Instituto Polit \u00e9cnico Nacional.

Photonic crystals are het erostructures built from periodic arrangements \nof materials with different refractive indexes. We consider that the refractive index of \nsemiconductor materials, such as GaAs, Si, and SiO 2, changes with the amount of the applied \npressure. Herein, spatial pe riodicity is broken as one of the semiconductor layers increases its \nlayers. We determined the existence of a confined mode within the cavity with a maximum value \nof the local density of states.  Currently, in the photonic crystal field, designing sensors o f ultra -\ncompact size and fast response is preferred. One of the sensors used in the one -dimensional \nphotonic crystal is the pressure sensor. The results show that, as pressure increases, the local \ndensity of states decreases within the confined mode. Howev er,  for the GaAs cavity, the results \nreveal that increased pressure favors the appearance of a more significant number of confined \nmodes at frequencies within the second photonic band gaps.    \nKeywords: Photonic crystal, local density of states, dyadic Gre en's functions, pressure, photonic \nband gaps.  \nAutor for correspondence:  francis.segoviac@gmail.com  \nReference : F.

Similarly, the \ntunnel effect is one of the physical phenomena that ha s generated interest for possible \napplications [1]. In this work, the theoretical study of the quantum tunneling effect in \nGaAs/AlGaAs systems was carried out for different configurations of the finite periodic type, \nranging from 2 to 5 quantum wells for d ifferent well and barrier sizes. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation \nwas solved using the transfer matrix method with the Kroning -Penney model as reference. It \nwas found that the transmission coefficient presents a resonant behavior and reaches the \nmaximum value of 1  at resonant energies. On the other hand, from the results of the \nphotoreflectance spectroscopy technique (PR), the experimental transition energies \ncorresponding to the quantum wires and the quantum well of GaAs were obtained, and these \nenergies were comp ared with the theoretically calculated optical transitions, which showed \ngood agreement.

The scientific community is always looking for new \nmaterials to achieve effective sea and brackish water desalination to reduce water scarcity. \nCommonly, theoretical, and experimental methods make a synergy to better understand and \nexplain the chemical and physical processes in water desalination electrodes. In this way, \nexper imental evidence pointed Mo1.33CTx MXene as an efficient ion intercalation material, in \nwhich both N \u00e1 and Cl are removed. However, the atomic -scale understanding of the \nphysicochemical processes due to the Na and Cl interaction with the MXene is still unkn own. We \nreport the N \u00e1 and Cl interaction with an OH functionalized Mo1.33C monolayer through a \ncomprehensive first -principles density functional theory assessment. Results demonstrate that \nNa atoms attach to Oxygen, whereas Cl atoms bond through hydrogen b onds to the functional \ngroups in the MXene, these bonds have two energy contributions: electrostatic and charge \ntransfer, which increases its adsorption energy. Electrostatic potential isosurfaces, Bader charge \nanalysis, and non -covalent interactions index  help clarify the way N \u00e1 and Cl attach to the MXene \nlayer. Oxygen atoms have an affinity for the electropositive N \u00e1 atoms, which after interaction \noxidize to N \u00e1, whereas hydrogen atoms \u2014of the hydroxyl groups \u2014interact with the \nelectronegative Cl atoms, whic h upon adsorption reduce to Cl. Our findings explain why OH -\nfunctionalized Mo1.33C can efficiently remove both Na and Cl atoms based on their affinities \nwith the functional groups present in the MXene layer.  \nWe thank DGAPA -UNAM projects IN105722, IN110820,  and IA100822, and CONACyT grant A1 -S-\n9070, for partial financial support.

Among \nsmart materials, auxetic materials represent a great potential for many industries, as a response \nto the emerging field of negative Poisson\u2019s ratio materials. To improve the inherent properties \nof an auxetic material or add properties of interest to the material, certain conditions are \nrequired.

Pulsed  laser ablation in Liquid (PLAL) is an efficient synthesis method for developing \nmetallic,  semiconducting, and c eramic nanoparticles. In this work, nanocolloids of bimetallic \nsilver/gold  (Ag/Au) nanoparticles were obtained by ablation using a Nd: YAG laser of 532 nm \nwavelength, with  an energy of 90 mJ, with a pulse switch of 10 nanoseconds, frequency 100 Hz. \nThe optical properties of Ag/Au nanocolloids were analyzed by UV -visible -NIR spectroscopy. \nTransmission  Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis was used for the morphology, structure, and \nsizes of these  bimetallic nanoparticles.

Although these materials are based on the same graphitic sp2 hybridization, the \ndifferences in their structures have allowed diversifying their properties; thus, there are \nsignificant variants that play an important role in the performance of these nanostructures \ndepending on the field in which could be employed . Due to their outstanding mechanical, \nthermal, electrical, and optical properties these materials have been proposed to be used in \ncomposite materials, catalysis support, electronic devices, and biomedical applications among \nothers. However, in addition t o the mentioned properties, other important features in carbon \nnanostructures are surface area, point of zero charge, and band gap, these surface and structure \ncharacteristics depend on graphitization degree, surface functionalization, and dimension. \nThere fore, the whole of the mentioned features and properties have made carbon \nnanostructures an important option in water remediation, removing diverse pollutants by \nadsorption or photocatalysis. This invited talk presents a summary of the results found in the  \nAdvanced Materials and Nanotechnology group, related to the adsorption capacities for removal \nof dyes and hexavalent chromium from aqueous solution achieved by different carbon \nnanostructures. The role that plays dimension, functionalization, and graphiti zation degree in \nthis process depending on rate -controlling mechanisms and equilibrium data are analyzed. Also, \nthe performance of carbon nanomaterials as photocatalysts depending on oxidation degree and \ndimension is revealed, in the degradation of phenoli c organic pollutants.

Box J -48, Puebla 72570, Mexico.  \nPlasmonics is the study of light at th e nanometer scale. Plasmonic research has received a \ntremendous boost recently due to the vast possibility of utilizing plasmonic nanostructures in \ndiverse technological fields which include ambiental remediation, therapeutics, biomedicine, \nenergy harvesti ng, and many others. However, for each of these technological applications, we \nneed plasmonic nanostructures of specific characteristics and functionality, which can be \ninduced only by manipulating their design. For example, pure metallic nanostructures of  \ndifferent sizes and shapes exhibit surface plasmon resonance at different energies. On \naggregation, the electric field around them gets modified. On the other hand, when anchored \nwith or embedded in some semiconductor or dielectric material, electron tran sfer occurs at their \ninterfaces, generating new functionality of the composite.

Due t o the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl and \nepoxy functional groups on the basal and edge plane of GO, this material is easily dispersed in aqueous \nsolvents, making its processing and usage more convenient. In addition, the strong hydrophilicity of GO \nguarant ees that it is a good candidate for many applications, including drug delivery, harmful cell treatment \nand water purification.  GO is usually obtained using the Hummers\u2019method by oxidizing graphite, where a \nconsiderable volume of strong acid wastes  are gene rated. Nowadays, the use of green chemistry in the \nresearch of nanomaterials has the purpose of decrease and eliminate the presence of toxic and \ncontaminating compounds during the synthesis of GO. In the present work, we produce GO through \npyrolysis of dif ferent agro -industrial wastes, which are: peanut shell (PSP), post -use commercial ground \n(PMCB) and artisanal (PXCB) coffee and were compared with GO produced by the Hummers\u2019  method. The \ndifferent properties of the products obtained from the green synthesi s and the Hummers\u2019 method were \ncompared using FTIR for the detection of functional groups and Raman spectroscopy for the detection of \nD (disorder) and G (graphitization) bands that are characteristic of GO. Afterwards, the GO of different \nmaterials were fu nctionalized with magnetite by chemical co -precipitation for use as catalysts. The \nfunctional groups present in the nanomaterial obtained are used as nucleation centers for the formation \nof metal oxides. Therefore, a major number of functional groups prese nt in the surface will cause the \nformation of metal oxide nuclei, obtaining metal oxide nanoparticles with good dispersion on GO sheets \nfor energy and environmental applications such as generation of biofuels, adsorptive removal of dyes in \nwater and antimi crobial activity in wastewater treatment plants.  \nKeywords:  Graphene oxide; agro -industrial wastes; nanoparticle; magnetite; nanocomposites  \nOne reference:  Somanathan, T., Prasad, K., Ostrikov, K.

These heterostructures of 2D \nmaterials are a new exciting field for new properties, like hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of \nheterostructures of few layers graphene (FLG) and graphene oxide (GO). Among the applications \nproposed, membranes present lot of opportunities for heterostructures in mechanical \nstabilization of the materials to e xposure of water or organic solvents, and for control of pores \nfor effective molecular separations. One example is GO exposure to water was already found \nunsuitable for long term stability. But heterostructures adding FLG or partially reduced \ngraphene oxid e (PrGO) to the GO are useful. In this work we address the use of GO as main \ncomponent for desalination application due to water easy slip through pores. The methodology \nincludes synthesis of GO by modified Hummer's method, synthesis of few layers graphene  (FLG) \nby ultrasound method, characterization of these materials by Raman spectroscopy, UV -Visible \nspectroscopy employment for the characterization of  the mixtures of FLG and GO, and \npermeability of the membranes for water and for a sodium chloride solutio n. We use weight \npercentage of GO and FLG in the assembly for the membranes, which is related to the weight of \na GO sheet and FLG sheets. That is why, we expect that the number of sheets of each material \nfor a same mass weight in the membrane will be diffe rent, and then we address calculations for \nidealized sheets that propose a coverage phenomenon in the conformation of the \nheterostructure GO -FLG.  \nKeywords: Graphene Oxide, Few Layers Graphene, Heterostructure, Membrane, 2D Materials.  \nReference:  A.

Among the related experimental works, zinc oxide (ZnO) stands out due \nto its morphological and physical properties. ZnO is a semiconductor material with a direct \nbandgap of 3.37 eV  and a high excitation binding energy of 60 meV. On the other hand, ZnO has \nbeen recognized as promising material for some electronic and optoelectronic applications, \nsuch as solar cells, transparent conductors, surface acoustic wave devices, gas sensors, etc. ZnO \ndeposited on porous samples as porous silicon nanostructures can present divers morphologies \nsuch as nanorods, nanobelts, nanowires, etc. The advantages of using such morphologies derive \nfrom the large surface -to-volume ratio, high specific area, and roughness surface that they can \npresent. The open structure and large surface area of PS make it  a good candidate for templates \nand gas sensing applications0. In the effort to propose a new functional material for possible \nsensing gas applications, we have deposited ZnO films on mPS using sol -gel spin coating and \nultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) techniques.  The changes in the growth of ZnO films on mPS \nwere studied using an UV -visible spectrometer, X -ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron \nmicrosco py (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). XRD analysis revealed a beneficial \ninfluence of mPS on the structural properties of ZnO films. SEM micrographs showed the growth \nand coverage of ZnO granular and flake -like crystals inside the pore of the substra te.

Subsequently, the \ncolloids obtained were fragmented with a Nd:YAG laser w ith nanoseconds pulses and a \nwavelength of 1064 nm, using an energy per pulse of 15 mJ and varying the exposure time, the \nmain objective of fragmenting the nanoparticles in the colloid was homogenize the size. \nHomogenization is important within nanoscience  since having all the nanoparticles of the same \nsize makes it possible to evaluate specific properties in the different fields of application.  \nThe characterization of the colloids was carried out using ultraviolet -visible spectroscopy (UV -\nVIS) and transmis sion electron microscopy (TEM) techniques in order to determine the   optical \nproperties, size and morphology. In addition, a theoretical study was carried out using finite \nelement modeling to obtain the theoretical absorption spectrum as a function of the size of \nspherical nanoparticles. In the results obtained shown that the maximum of the absorption \nband that is in the interval of 300 to 600 nm presents a shift after the fragmentation towards \nshorter wavelengths, these results were simulated and suggest t hat with the different laser \nfragmentation times used, there was a decrease in the sizes of the nanoparticles starting at \n30nm and ending at approximately 5nm, these results were subsequently corroborated by TEM.  \nKeywords: Laser ablation of solids in liqui ds; silver nanoparticles; laser fragmentation.  \nAuthor for correspondence: mariela@cicese.mx  \nReference:   The effect of laser pulse energy on ZnO nanoparticles formation by liquid phase \npulsed laser ablation Suha I.

That is where nanotechnology \nhas had accelerated research expanding on existing materials providing new and innovative \nproperties or creating materials ab initio improving on their bulk counterparts. On this subject, \nmagnet ic nanoparticles (MNP) attracted substantial attention due to their properties allowing \nthem to navigate remotely to specific directions, vibrating with targeting coatings or heating \ntissue through vibration, among others. However, the toxicological impact  these nanomaterials \ncould have inside complex structures like the vascular system must be studied. A hemolysis test \nwas carried out with different morphologies, cubes, and rods, at different concentrations (0.1, \n0.3 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 mgmL-1) to accomplish  this. Magnetite materials were obtained through \nchemical coprecipitation (CQ) and chemical reduction (RQ) respectively. Results show that \nmorphology is an essential factor to consider in toxicology. The nanorods showed a toxicological \nbehavior in most con centrations, while magnetite in cubes only showed prominent hemolysis \nat 0.7 mg. These results show that concentrations are crucial in bulk materials; morphology, at \nthe nanoscale determines certain toxicological impacts on biological systems.  \nKeywords : Magnetite; Silica coating; Nanorods; Nanobiomedicine; Hemolysis  \nCorresponding author : karen.esquivel@uaq.mx  \nThis work was supported by:  Engineering Faculty -UAQ FIN202106 and FONDEC -UAQ 2021 \nFIN202115 and FIN202116.  \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n218  \n \n[ NSN -328 ] NANOSTRUCTURE FO RMATION FROM HIGH POWER \nINTENSE CAVITATION  \nIvan Camps 2 , Julio Cesar Cruz 2 , Stephen Muhl (muhl@unam.mx) 2 , Enrique Camps 1 , Enrique \nCampos 1  \n1 Instituto  Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares, Carret.

Even though, there have \nbeen reports of the reduction of the size of the particles, usually the precursors are in forms of \ncompacted pellets, powders or in general soft materials with weak coalescent bonds. We \npresent the results of the studies performed on two materials, titanium and graphite, with \ncompletely different properties (mechanical and chemical), that were submitted to intense high \npower ultrasonic vibration in water. In these experiments, strong bubble cavitation was \nproduced in the liquid medium, this transferred enough energy to the starting materials to \nproduced suspensions of nanostructures. In the case of the Ti, the size distribution and changes \nof the properties of the nanoparticles were observedby transmission electron microscopy (TEM), \nsuch as, mild oxidation and the formation of non -stoichiometric Ti -O core -shell structures. For \nthe graphite, after the cavitation, the observed materials were mainly overly stacked sheets of \ngraphene, confirmed by TEM and Raman spectroscopy. These suspensions were used in spin -\ncoating to produce films on glass, and the e lectrical conductivity and optical transmittance was \nmeasured.  \nKeywords : nanomaterials, graphene, titanium, cavitation.  \nAuthor correspondence : muhl@unam.mx  \nAcknowledgments : This work was done with the support of PAPIIT -DGAPA project - IG101220. \nI.C. acknowledges the Postdoctoral grant founded by CONACyT.  \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n219  \n \n[ NSN -16 ] ORANGE: ULTRA -SMALL GOLD PARTICLES  \nManuel Cortez -Valadez (MANUELCORTEZ@LIVE.COM) 1 , Luis Fernando L \u00f3pez-V\u00e1zquez 2  \n1 Conacyt -Investigaci\u00f3n  en F\u00edsica, Universidad de Sonora, Hermosillo C.P. 83000, Sonora, M \u00e9xico.  \n2 Investigaci\u00f3n  en F\u00edsica, Universidad de Sonora, Hermosillo C.P. 83000, Sonora, M \u00e9xico.  \nSub-nanostructured systems are the edge of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The application \nof these subsystems has allowed furt her progress in studies of nano -bio interactions, size -\ndependent localization of small clusters inside cancer cells, tuning of surface electronic states, \netc. This study aims at the green route synthesis to obtain sub -nanostructured gold species \nusing Citrus x sinensis  (orange fruit). Chloroauric acid (HAuCl 4) by Sigma Aldrich was used as a \nprecursor solution Au+3 and Citrus x sinensis  extract as a reducing and stabilizer agent of the \nparticles. The infusion was kept under magnetic agitation at room temperature for 1 h. The \nsolution was filtered and stored for 24 h. The gold species obtained exhibit localized absorption \nbands into the U ltraviolet region (338 nm). No evidence of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was \nobserved. TEM analysis revealed the identification of sub -nanostructured species with \npredominant sizes of about 0.9 nm. Such systems were tested as SERS substrates using pyridi ne, \nwith favorable results. The chemical enhancement (CE) mechanism was studied as a leading \nsource of the SERS effect. Complementarily, the structural and optical response to the \ninteraction between gold clusters (Au 2n, with n=1 -5) and pyridine was modele d using DFT \n(Density Functional Theory) at the B3LYP (Becke -3-parameter -Lee-Yang -Parr) approximation \nlevel in combination with the LANL2DZ (Los Alamos National Laboratory 2 -Double -Zeta) basis \nset. The correlation between adsorption energy and the SERS Enha ncement factor was analyzed. \nThe SERS effect depends on the interaction distance between the Py and metal cluster systems, \nindicating a maximum enhancement close to the experimentally reported value for the N -Au \nbond.  \nKeywords: Sub-nanostructured gold part icles, chemical enhancement mechanism, Citrus x \nsinensis , SERS effect.  \nCorresponding and presenting Author:  manuelcortez@live.com  \nReference: Bo Yang, Ju Chou, Xiaoqing Dong, Chengtun Qu, Qingsong Yu, Kerry J.

Optical se nsors \nbased on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) have been demonstrated to be effective \nplatforms for the quantitative monitoring of biological and chemical processes. Plasmonic \nnanostructures such as nanoholes on metal nanofilms can excite LSPR. Those plasmonic \nnanostructures have been employed as sub -diffraction optical systems with high aspect -ratio \nthat involves optical transmission and large electric field intensities. However, a low -cost, fast, \neasy, controllable, and reproducible integration  methodology of those nanostructures into \nmicrofluidic systems still represents a big challenge for the scientific and industrial community. \nHere, we describe the numerical investigation of plasmonic nanoholes and the microfluidic \nchannel by a mathematical  modeling software as well as the nanofabrication strategy of a \nsensor, consisting of gold nanoholes integrated in a microchannel. The nanofabrication \nmethodology describes four steps: i) polystyrene nanospheres deposition. ii) Design of the \nmicrofluidic m ask. iii) Gold and titanium deposit by e -beam evaporation and iv) removal of \nnanospheres. The resulting sensor platform consists of gold nanoholes of 21 nm of thickness, \nwhose diameter can range from 90 nm to 100 nm with a random distribution integrated in  a \nmicrofluidic channel of 70 \u00b5m of thickness. Therefore, the well -controlled fabrication process of \nthe optical platform with microfluidics provides the possibility to use the sensor in a wide range \nof biosensing applications.  \nKeywords : optical sensor, nanoholes, microfluidics, LSPR, nanofabrication  \nThis work was supported by  the project SIP20221069  \nAuthor for correspondence : viraisolistinoco@gmail.com  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n221  \n \n[ NSN -119 ]  QUANTUM TUNNELING BETWEEN PARALLEL \nSEMICONDUCTOR NANOWIRES  \nEsteban Cruz -Hern \u00e1ndez (esteban.cruz@uaslp.mx) 1 , Reyna M \u00e9ndez -Camacho 1 , Reyna M \u00e9ndez -\nCamacho 2  \n1 Coordinaci \u00f3n para la Innovaci \u00f3n y Aplicaci \u00f3n de la Ciencia y la Tecnolog\u00eda , Universidad Aut \u00f3noma \nde San Luis Potos \u00ed, Sierra Leona 550, 78210 San Luis Potos \u00ed, M\u00e9xico.  \n2 Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Aut \u00f3noma de San Luis Potos \u00ed, Av.

When these nanowires are close enough, quantum \nelectron tunneling is expected between them. Then, because extended or localized electronic \nstates can be established in the wires by tuning its electron density, the tunneling configuration \nbetween adjacent wires could be conveniently adjusted by an external gate. By considering the \ncollective nature of electrons using a Yukaw \u00e1like ef fective potential, we theoretically explore the \nelectron interaction between closely spaced, parallel GaAs/AlGaAs nanowires while varying the \nelectron density and geometrical parameters [1]. We find that, at a low  density Wigner crystal \nregime, the tunneli ng can take place between adjacent localized states along and transversal to \nthe wires axis, which in turn allows to create two \u00e1nd thre \u00e9dimensional electronic distributions \nwith valuable potential applications.  \nKeywords:  Wigner crystal, quantum tunneling, nanowires.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  esteban.cruz@uaslp.mx  \nReference: [1] R.

The \neffect caused by this phenomenon in stone monuments has been studied for several years, \nhowever, in our country there is little information on how to prevent this damage and keep the \nmaterials protected. Coa tings can be used as a chemical barrier to protect these monuments, \nderivatives of acrylic acid are normally used, however, nanomaterials such as graphene, due to \ntheir unique and interesting properties, have emerged as potential coating materials since th ey \ncan be functionalized with low -cost and commonly used materials to give rise to a new one, with \nimproved physicochemical properties depending on the intended application. In this work \nrecycled polymer is functionalized with graphene and proved as coatin g to protect stone \nmonuments. They recycling of plastic waste is an alternative to reduce pollution, due to the large \namount of plastic waste that is produced. An example, thousands of tons of polystyrene are \ngenerated per year creating substantial amounts  of garbage since this plastic generates many \nempty spaces, its composition is 98% air and 2% polymer. Although the production od plastics \ndoes not represent a major problem, because the do not degrade in their environment, their \nelimination does, since it  is cumulative. During this work, the problems of deterioration of stone \nmonuments caused by acid rain and plastic recycling are considered, a polystyrene coating \nfunctionalized with graphene is synthetized and characterized by Raman spectroscopy and \nconta ct angle. Afterwards, the functionalized polymer was used as protecting coating of quarry \nand marble, common materials of stone monuments. Finally, improvements in the properties \nof the polymer after its functionalization with graphene were observed, such as, enhanced \nadherence to surfaces and a better protection of stones in acid environments.  \nKeywords:  graphene, coating, polystyrene, acid rain.  \nREFERENCES : Cui, G.; Zhang, C.; Wang, A.; Zhou, X.; Xing, X.; Liu, J.; Li, Z.; Chen, Q.; Lu, Q.

The synt hesis and subsequent oxidation of bismuth particles in \nan aqueous sodium chloride medium is studied in this work, comparing the oxidation time and \nthe type of bismuth compounds obtained in this medium and in a traditional synthesis in a \ndistilled water med ium. Small -sized bismuth particles are prepared by laser ablation of solids in \nliquids technique using sodium chloride in different concentrations as the aqueous medium. \nThe laser is configured to emit 300 pulses, of 6 nanoseconds duration per pulse, at a wavelength \nof 1064 nm on a 3 cm diameter disk -shaped bismuth target. The particles have been \ncharacterized by UV -Visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission \nelectron microscopy.

The \nperiodic/quasiperiodic structures were fabricated by electrochemical etching and were \nsubjected to two -stage of dry oxidation at 350 \u00b0C for 30 minutes and 900 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. In \nthis way, we obtained an oxidized perio dic/quasiperiodic structure that exhibits  two localized \nmodes in the transmission spectra; where porous silicon normally absorbs light making the \ncreation of silicon based photonic crystal devices impossible in that electromagnetic energy \nregion. Moreover,  we used the Maxwell -Garnett model and J. E. Lugo model to obtain the \nrefractive index of porous silicon and Si -SiO 2 porous. The J. E. Lugo model predicts that our \nstructures are made almost complete of SiO 2. Furthermore, we calculated the transmission, \nreflection, and absorption spectrum on periodic/quasiperiodic structure in the UV -VIS range \nbefore and after dry oxidation, where we can have observed that a periodic/quasiperiodic \nstructure fabricated of porous silicon absorbs more the light than the period ic/quasiperiodic \nstructure manufactured of Si -SiO 2 porous. In this way, we made a theoretical analysis of \nabsorption and Rayleigh scattering losses, at the wavelength of the two localized modes in the \nperiodic/quasiperiodic structure estimating the photon losses due to Rayleigh scattering before \nand after oxidation in our samples. So we used the equation of Breit -Wigner modified by Miller \nto get the lifetime of photons and photon losses at the wavelength of the two localized modes. \nWe found that the lifetim e of the photons in the VIS range is smaller than the lifetime of photons \nin the blue and green range. From these results, we can conclude that dry oxidation helps to \nreduce absorption and scattering losses in the blue and green region. Optical characteriz ation \nof periodic/quasiperiodic structure was carried out by UV -VIS-\nNIR.                                                                                                                                \nKeywords: porous silicon, Si -SO 2 porous, absorption losses, scattering losses, \nperiodic/quasiperiodic structure  \nAuthor for correspondence:  rayojimenezv@fisica.unam.mx  \nThis work was supported by  postdoctoral fellowship CONACYT   \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n226  \n \n[ NSN -120 ] TOXICITY EVALUATION OF A TIO2/FE3O4 COMPOSITE \nON B RACHIONUS CALYCIFLORUS ROTIFERS  \nLuis Alfonso P \u00e1ramo Serrano (luissofonsolaps@gmail.com) 3 , Iliana Ernestina Medina Ram \u00edrez 1 , \nRodrigo Vel \u00e1zquez Castillo 3 , Marina Vega Gonz \u00e1lez 2 , Karen Esquivel Escalante \n(karen.esquivel@uaq.mx) 3  \n1 Department of Chemistry, Universidad Aut \u00f3noma de Aguascalientes, Av.

However, using nanomaterial s entails a problem: their \nincorrect handling and possible introduction into the environment, which can affect various \norganisms. The objective of this research focuses on knowing the possible adverse effects that \nvarious types of nanomaterials such as TiO 2, Fe 3O4, and a TiO 2/Fe 3O4 composite may have in a \nmodel of aquatic toxicity such as rotifers. These organisms are an essential part of the healthy \ndevelopment of various bodies of water, as well as the toxic effect of a sample of water with \nparacetamol treated by photocatalysis to  evaluate the viability of reinsertion of said treated \nwater to ecosystems inhabited by organisms. Rotifers ( Brachionus calyciflorus ) were subjected to \nacute toxicity tests in concentrations of 10,20, 40, 80, and 100 ppm of nanomaterials for 48 h, \nrecordin g the number of living organisms based on their response to light stimulation. On the \nother hand, the toxicity of water treated by photocatalysis without the presence of nanoparticles \nwas evaluated following the same methodology. The results showed that ex posure to \nsynthesized nanomaterials in the concentrations did not mean a reduction in the number of \nliving organisms. Using a paracetamol solution treated by photocatalysis as a medium for \ndeveloping rotifers did not reduce the number of live rotifers.  \nKeywords: Nanotechnology, nanotoxicology, titanium dioxide, magnetite, rotifer.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  karen.esquivel@uaq.mx;  imedina1@gmail.com   \nReference:   R.

Plasmas occur more commonly than usually \nconsidered; more than 99% of the known universe consists of plasmas. Plasma research has led, not only  to a better \nunderstanding of the universe, but to many practical uses: new manufacturing techniques and consumer products.  \nThe term \u201cVacuum\u201d describes pressure conditions below standard atmospheric pressure. Vacuum technology is applied to all \nprocesses a nd physical measurement carried out under vacuum conditions.  \nA large variety of deposition and characterization techniques work under vacuum conditions and many of them make use of \nplasmas.  \n\u2022         Sputtering     \n\u2022          Pulsed Laser Deposition                \n\u2022          Plasma Enhanced CVD                  \n\u2022          Plasma Assisted MBE       \n\u2022          Atomic Layer Deposition                      \n\u2022          Plasma Polymerization  \n\u2022          Plasma Etching  \n\u2022          Closed Space Sublimation             \n\u2022          and any othe r PVD techniques  \n\u2022         Inductively Coupled Plasma  \n\u2022         Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy  \n\u2022         Mass Spectroscopies  \n\u2022         Scanning Probe Microscopies (SEM, STM)   \n\u2022         X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy  \n\u2022         etc. \nFurthermore, plasmas can occur within liquids, either during Cavitation phenomena or by laser ablation, the later allowing for \nthe synthesis of Nanoparticles.  \nAlthough plasma and vacuum science and technology are often considered to be mature fields, with little new developments; \nin fact, arc processes, nanotechnology and biomaterials continue to provide and demand new research in this field.  \nWe invite you to present in this symposium your latest research, observations and developments in this very important basic \narea of study.   \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n229  \n \n[ PLV-163 ] Characterization of hybrid plasma generated by \nmicrowave ECR -assisted reactive pulsed laser deposition.  \nEnrique Campos Gonzalez (enrique.campos.conacyt@inin.gob.mx) 2 , Enrique Camps 2 , Carlos \nRivera -Rodr \u00edguez 1 , Jos\u00e9 G.

The  aim of this work is to report the study of the \ncombination of continuous  nitrogen plasma, formed by a microwave discharge and pulsed \nplasma of laser ablation of a molybdenum target. The hybrid plasma was created at a working \npressure of 6 x 10-4 Torr.  Plasma parameters were measured using a type specific Langmuir \nprobe, for e ach plasma source separately. The plasma density and electron temperature were \nmeasured using a cylindrical probe, and their dependence on the power is shown. The mean \nkinetic ion energy and plasma density for the case of PLD plasma were determined using a  \nplanar Langmuir probe. Optical emission spectroscopy was carried out to identify chemically \nactive species in the plasma in all cases. In this work, we report the formation of MoN films using \nthe hybrid plasma system.

BiCuOSe consists of alternating layers \nof [Cu 2Se2]2\u2212 tetrahedra and anti -fluorite [Bi 2O2]2+ distorted tetrahedra in a tetragonal P4/nmm \nstructure. Its p -type conducti vity can be enhanced by the substitution of some divalent ion (X2+) \nfor Bi3+. In this work, a ceramic target of BiCuOSe was made in a micro -planetary mill from the \nsolid -state reaction of the precursors Bi 2O3, Cu 2O, and Se, and was doped with Mg, Sr, and B a \nions. BiCuOSe powders were used as targets in the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique to \ngrow BiCuOSe and doped BiCuOSe thin films. XRD patterns for BiCuOSe and doped BiCuOSe \ntargets were indexed concerning PDF#45 -0296, and it was found that most of the peaks present \nbelong to the quaternary BiCuOSe. The optical characterization of the films was performed by \nspectroscopy measurements in the UV -Vis range. The undoped BiCuOSe films have an average \ntransmittance of 30%, when doping with Mg, the transmitt ance increases to 40%;  to 60%, with \nSr; and for Ba, the transmittances are 80%. The electrical characterization using Hall effect \nmeasurements indicates that for the undoped BiCuOSe films there are carrier densities of \n1.5x1018 cm-3, when substituting with  Mg atoms the concentration of carriers was \nmaintained;  but, when doing so with  Sr and Ba the concentration decreased by two orders of \nmagnitude. Regarding electrical conductivity, there are values of up to 50 S/cm.  \nThe authors acknowledge the technical su pport of Marcela Guerrero, A.

The application of p-type TSO films to \nelectrodes in solar cells is very attractive for suppressing the electron -hole recombination at the \ninterface region between the TSO and the p-type layer.  In this work, a ceramic target of LaCuOS \nwas made through a two -step route, first the synthesis of CuLaO 2 by solid -state reaction and \nlater its sulfurization under a sulfur atmosphere. This is an economical, efficient, and versatile \nprocess that eliminates the use of toxic H 2S gases, which are used in the conventional \nsulfurization process. LaCuOS powders wer e used as targets in the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) \ntechnique to grow LaCuOS thin films. XRD patterns for LaCuOS thin films present the planes \n(001), (002), and (006). LaCuOS films present optical transmittances between 52 -81% in the \nvisible range of th e spectrum, which are suitable values for their application in transparent \ndevices. Electrical measurements indicate high values of hole mobility, and carrier densities of \nup to 1019 cm-3, with p -type electrical conductivity of 0.74 S/cm. Such properties e nsure that \nLaCuOS has a high potential to be integrated into devices as transparent electrodes.  \nThe authors acknowledge the technical support of Marcela Guerrero, A.

Three types of discharge can exist in a hollow cathode: a typical \nlow-current high -voltage discharge, a resonant discharge with a density of ~1017 m-3, and a \ndispersed arc with a density of ~1019 m-3.  For certain combinations of gas pressures  (p), and \nhollow cathode diameter ( D), at relatively high applied powers, the negative glow of the plasma \nalmost completely occupies the interior volume of the electrode. This work reports spatial \ndistribution profiles of a hollow cathode discharge by opti cal emission spectroscopy (OES) using \ndifferent electrode materials for both resonant and non -resonant discharge source operated in \nthe DC mode. The spatial distribution profiles of Ar I spectral lines at 811.5 and 750.3 nm were \nanalyzed for aluminum, copp er, and graphite at different gas pressures. OES results show that \nin a resonant discharge at a pD = 1.3 Torr\u00b7cm, there is a significant difference in the emission \nspatial between Al, Cu, and graphite (keeping constant power and pressure), and the emission  \nintensity of Ar I is higher for the aluminum than for the graphite. In the three materials, the Ar I \ntransitions due to electrons impact excitation occurs mainly at the edges of the cathode, and Ar \nI transitions due to ions or fast atom impact excitation occurs mostly at the center of the hollow \ncathode.  \nKeywords: Hollow cathode discharge, optical emission spectroscopy, spatial distribution \nprofiles.  \nAuthor corresponding: mamf@ciencias.unam.mx  \n[1] S.

Typically, a too high supply of reactive gas will allow the formation of the stoichiometric \ncomposition film but will cause poisoning of the target surface, which may reduce the deposition rate \nsignificantly. There may exist optimum processing conditions where both high deposition rate and \nstoichiometric film composition may be obtained [1]. Thus, we propose to study the target poisoning by \nLaser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS \u2013 imaging).  \nLIBS \u2013 imaging is an all -optical elemental analysis method that can analyze a sample  in situ  as the technique \ndoes not require previous preparation; additionally, the sample state of matter and its medium is not \nfundamental. This technique collects and analy zes the light intensity from an ablation plasma using optical \nemission spectroscopy (OES) [2].This work mainly aims to determine the spatially resolved composition of \nthe target surface using LIBS - imaging for various poisoning conditions.  \nHence, differen t reactive magnetron sputtering thin -film depositions of silicon oxides and nitrides were \nmade at different poisoning rates and at different working pressures. For each thin -film deposit, the target \nwas mapped step -by-step and in situ by LIBS, starting at the center and ending before hitting the edge of \nthe magnetron shield. Then the spectroscopy data were analyzed to see the behavior between the target\u2019s \nablated position and the emission lines of its constituents. Principal component analysis (PCA) was \nperformed to see if grouping conditions were plausible to similar conditions.  \nIt was observed that the compound information was contained in the first three laser pulses so that a direct \nbehavior could be observed between the emission lines, the target\u2019s posi tion, and its poisoning degree. \nTherefore, LIBS -imaging proved to be useful to make inferences about the target poisoning.  \nKeywords: Reactive magnetron sputtering, Target -poisoning, LIBS \u2013 imaging, Principal Components Analysis.  \nReferences : [1]         S.

This made it possible to use \noxygen plasma for effective ion irradiation of the sample surface. Experimental samples \napproximately 3x5 mm were cut from a standard commercial GaAs wafer. The time of  oxygen \nplasma irradiation varied from 5 to 30 minutes. Plasma treatments were performed at room \ntemperature. The formation of GaAs 1-yOy film was confirmed by the SIMS and Raman \nspectroscopies. The GaAs 1-yOy film thickness grew over time from 15 nm to 65 n m according to \nthe hyperbolic law (~ t1/2). The analysis of the surface with an atomic force microscope showed \na low roughness of the resulting surface, approximately equal to the initial roughness of the \nGaAs crystal.

With respect to the first \nmentioned, it has even been modified along with the gas inlet; varying geometry and dimensions \nof the p ipe through which the injection is made. The debate on this topic lies in the density \nbalance with plasma coupling. By directly injecting the gases into the field, the coupling is \nfacilitated and the decomposition of the gases into radicals would be more e ffective. This leads \nto denser samples as the gases do not leave the induced field. Therefore, there is no guarantee \nof homogeneity in the manufacture of the film, due the affectation of the field by the presence \nof the holes. The foregoing opens the way t o the characterization in terms of the distribution of \nthe power induced to the cathode, generation of reactant species and threshold or minimum \npower that can be coupled. Based on the above, studies of the ion species within the plasma \nwere implemented th rough two techniques. The first, using a retarding field energy analyzer \n(RFEA) measuring different ion energy distribution functions. Second, using a Langmuir probe, \nwhich allows measurements of electron temperature and density.  Results of ion distributio n \nfunctions, ion density and temperature will be shown, varying gas pressures (Ar, NH3) and \napplied powers.   \nKeywords:  PECVD, RFEA, Langmuir probe  \nAuthor corresponding: mamf@ciencias.unam.mx  \nThis work was supported by PAPIIT - IG101220, A.

It is possible to modify the \noptical properties of TiO 2 by incorporating noble metal nanoparticles in order to enhance the \nphotoresponse in several solar energy applications [1].

Ti and Au targets were simultaneously ablated \nsuch that the plasmas combined under a reactive atmosphere containing oxygen at a pressure \nof  Torr. The plasmas were analyzed individually by means of a planar Langmuir probe to \ncalculate the m ean kinetic energy and the plasma density of the Ti and Au ions. Ti plasma \nparameters were kept constant at 196 eV and  while the Au plasma density was varied \nfrom  to  in order to change the Au content in each film. Optical properties were obtained by UV -\nVis spectroscopy measurements, with which the band gap was calculated by means of the Tauc \nmethod, resulting in a value of 2.36 eV for the amorphous TiO 2 thin film, and decreasing at a \nvalue of 1.54 eV for the film with the highest Au plasma density.

The main objective is to analyze the \neffect generated by the B addition on the sintering kinetics, microstructure and mechanical \nproperties. Samples with 2, 5 and 7 wt.% of B, as well as Ti -25Ta alloy were sintered at 1100 \u00b0C \nwith a heating rate of 150 \u00b0C -min-1 with a constant load of 50 MPa. Sintering kinetics and the in -\nsitu densification were performed by the analysis of the punch displacement during SPS \nprocessing. Structural details of consolidated materials were evaluated by t he combination of X -\nRay diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical properties were evaluated by \nVickers microhardness. The results show that samples reached high densification values up to \n99.7% of the relative density by using lower sinteri ng temperatures in comparison to \nconventional sintering techniques. It was also determined an increment in the activation energy \nas the B addition increased. The alloys showed a lamellar microstructure which is generated by \nthe mechanical alloying. The mic rohardness was increased up to 45% by the addition of B with \nrespect to the Ti25Ta alloy. It is concluded that B addition has a strong effect on the sintering \nkinetics, although with a small reduction on the final densification. The microhardness values \nobtained with 4 wt.% of B were around 1000 Vickers, which is promissory for improving the wear \nbehavior of the Ti25Ta alloy.  \nKey words: Spark Plasma Sintering, Ti alloys, kinetics, Microstructure, Microhardness.  \nCorresponding author : luisra24@gmail.com  \nPresenting author : ingenierofah@uaz.edu.mx  \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n244  \n \n[ PLV -369 ] Pulsed Laser Deposition of Thin Films from the \nAblation of Cu in Oxygen Containing Atmospheres at Different \nPressures  \nJ.G.

The present work aims to take advantage of BiVO 4 photocatalyti c \nproperties and reduce the time of synthesis. BiVO 4 was synthesized by microwave -assisted \nhydrothermal synthesis which allows reaction time reduction to just 30 s. The BiVO 4 powders \nwere obtained with microwave hydrothermal reaction carried at 30 s, and c haracterized via X -\nRay diffraction, Fourier -Transform Infrared spectroscopy, N 2 adsorption -desorption test, and \nUV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy. The results are BiVO 4 with 2.4 eV band gap, and photo -degradation of \nciprofloxacin evaluated by UV -Vis-NIR spectroscopy  reach to be more than 40% in 4 hours.

In this work it was proposed to study experim entally \nand theoretically by means of DFT the effect of substitutional doping of manganese in \nconcentrations of 0.125 and 0.25 mol with cobalt or nickel in the MnAl 2O4 cubic spinel phase, in \nan aqueous aluminum ion battery system with an electrolyte of \u201cwa ter in salt\u201d of AlCl 3*6H 2O. \nTheoretical study shows that the MnAl 2O4 phase presents a bandgap of 2.6 eV. When MnAl 2O4 \nis doped with cobalt from 0.125 to 0.25 mol, the bandgap tends to increase in the order of 0.1 \neV, while with nickel, the bandgap value ab ruptly decreases to 0.638 eV at a concentration of \n0.125 and then rise again to 1.8 eV as the doping increases to 0.25 mol by DFT analysis. From \nthe band structure it was found that all phases have a direct band gap in all doped and undoped \nphases. Experim entally, the phases were synthesized using the modified Pechini method. The \ndoped and undoped phases were indexed to cubic spinel Galaxite MnAl 2O4 phase, showing no \nsecondary phases in the material; thus, indicating the correct insertion of Co and Ni in the \nmanganese sites. The morphology of the doped and undoped phases were characterized by \nSEM; which showed the formation of single crystals with si zes around 100 \u03bcm; which will enable \nto reduce capacity fade due to low interface defects between particles and slow manganese \ndissolution. EDS showed the presence of the dopant in the structure. In future, this material will \nbe used to build the complete cell of an aluminum ion battery.  \nKeywords:  Aluminum Ion Battery, Single Crystal Cathode, Pechini, Manganese Aluminate, DFT  \nAuthor for correspondence:  al216709@alumnos.uacj.mx  \nOne reference:  [1]       W.

Bioethanol produced from corn stover is \na promising option for diversification from fossil fuels due to its high abundance and low cost. \nTherefore, this work will focus on the greater use of lignocellulosic was te, specifically, corn \nstover, for which we not only propose obtaining bioethanol but also synthesizing a non -toxic \nheterogeneous catalyst, both from plant biomass. Where it will be used in the hydrolysis reaction \nof the lignocellulosic material. The synth esis of the heterogeneous catalyst is carried out from \nthe same biomass, which is subjected to a thermal treatment, proposing a more sustainable \nprocess. Subsequently, the resulting carbonaceous material is treated by means of a sulfonation \nreaction. These  catalysts have excellent activity due to their acid character. The catalysts \nobtained will be analyzed by structural techniques. On the other hand, the biomass will be \nsubjected to chemical treatment (acid hydrolysis) by adding H 2SO 4 to obtain sugars such  as \ncellulose and lignin, the hydrolysate is placed in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst to \nobtain reducing sugars. Finally, to produce bioethanol, an alcoholic fermentation of these sugars \nusing the yeast S. cerevisiae is proposed.

This \nmaterial is commonly deposited by thermal evaporation presenting electrical resistivity values \nabout of 105 W*cm to 109 W*cm. CdTe is applied in thin solar cells as p -type layer which is in \ncontact with metal back electrode  in solar cells. In the CdTe/metal junction a Schottky barrier \nexits; and small number of charge carriers have enough energy to get over the barrier and cross \nto the metal back contact. To solve part of this problem, nanostructured Te thin films were used \nas intermediate layers between CdTe and metal contact. Te layers whit different physical \nproperties were deposited on CdS/CdTe structure by thermal evaporation employing different \ngrowth parameters. The electrical parameters of CdTe solar cells were influe nced by p+ Te \nregions. p+ Te regions used as intermediate layer with large deposition time increases the FF \nand V OC values from 30% to 60% and 560 mV to 730 mV respectively. Also, the electrical resistivity \nis reduced from 106 W*cm to 103 W*cm.

Conventional solar panel \ncleaning methods use large amount of water, which is a scarce resource in such areas, and \nrepresent a considerable expense in hum an resources and cleaning products or devices. \nPreviously, the performance of \u201cassisted natural cleaning methods\u201d by control algorithms in \nsolar trackers under favorable weather conditions has been studied, taking advantage of low \nand medium intensity rain s to improve the cleaning effect that it produces in solar panels. As \nanother approach, self -cleaning coatings have been extensively studied for application on \nsurfaces exposed to dirt outdoors and more recently have been implemented for application on \nthe surface of solar panels. These coatings, through the superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic \nproperties, allow to take advantage of rain or dew drops to carry out a self -cleaning process, \neliminating the dust accumulated on the surface of the panel. Both ass isted natural cleaning \nand self -cleaning coatings have proven to be viable contributions in photovoltaic installations, \nhowever, they are not capable of fully replacing conventional cleaning methods, at least not \napplying them individually. The objective o f this research is to demonstrate superior \nperformance to other cleaning methods through the joint use of self -cleaning coatings and \nassisted natural cleaning methods, as well as to evaluate the joint performance in laboratory \nenvironment and in real envir onment, evaluating the soiling rate, with and without the use of \ncoatings as well as the natural assisted cleaning techniques.  \n \nKeywords:  self-cleaning coatings, soiling, cleaning methods, sun tracking.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  giovanni.cruz @cimav.edu.m x \nPresenting author:  Giovanni Alejandro Cruz Ortiz  \nReference:  G.

Furthermore, studies indicate that it can \nreach efficiency up to 26.8% [1]. Nevertheless, in GaAs -based materials the surface plays an \nimportant role and in photovoltaics decreasing the conversion  efficiency by the absorption of \nshort -wavelengths. In this work, a doped layer known as a front surface field (FSF) is inserted in \nan (Al,Ga)As photovoltaic heterostructure with the aim to reduce the effect of surface \nrecombination. First, a numerical stu dy is employed to determine the effect of the AlGaAs layer \non the carrier\u2019s distribution at surface, being reduced as the Aluminum composition (%Al) is \nincreased. Then, three (Al,Ga)As solar cell samples were grown by molecular beam epitaxy with \n40 nm AlGa As FSF layer where the %Al was set to 0, 15, and 30.   The Raman measurement \nshowed that L - and LO vibrational modes intensity changes, suggesting that surface charge \ndensity at surface was modified by %Al. FSF layer was studied through the Franz -Keldysh \noscillation (FKO) in the photoreflectance spectra, finding a reduction in their period. The \noptoelectronic properties are explored by current -voltage measurements under AM1.5 \nillumination spectra with 550 W/cm2 power density, revealing a increasing in the pe rformance \nby the improvement on the short -wavelength absorption when the FSF layer is %Al = 0. Thus, \nsurface has an important effect on research of thin -film technology of photovoltaic systems and \nthe FSF layer is a strategy to modulate their impact.  \nKeywo rds: Front surface field, GaAs solar cells, Molecular beam epitaxy.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  irving.cortes@uaslp.mx  \n[1] https://doi.org/10.1109/16.918225   \nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of FRC -UASLP, COPOCyT, and CONACYT -Mexico \nthrough grants: INFR -2015 -01-255489, CB 2015 - 257358, PNCPN2014 -01-248071, Fideicomiso \n23871, and Investigadoras e Investigadores por Mexico (Project No. 44).  \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n257  \n \n[ RWE -374 ] Numerical design of GaAs -based Schottky solar \ncells for multi -photon absorption  \nD.

Additionally, the SBSC can be employed to develop strategies to overcome the \ntheoretical efficiency limit Shockley Queisser of 33.5% for conventional single -junction cells. In \nthis work, technology computer aided design (TCAD) is employed to develop SBSC. The model \nemploys carriers\u2019 generation and recombination process, layer sequence and doping profile, the \nproperties of the electrodes were also considered. First, the metal work -function is explored to \nproduced ohmic and Schottky junctions employing 500 nm  of a single layer based on Cu, Ag, In, \nSb, and InGa on the 5x1018 cm-3 n-type GaAs. An increasing on the Schottky barrier effect is \nobtained when the high difference work -function is employed (Ag) in conjunction with the ohmic \ncontact (Cu). Next, the mult i-photon absorption mechanism is added to the SBSC by the \ninclusion of quantum wells. GaAs -wells are embedded in higher bandgap material system. The \nInAs, InGaAs, and AlGaAs barriers are explored. The numerical results indicated that AlGaAs \nbarriers increa ses the current -voltage behavior. Thus, the barrier heigh is designed through the \naluminum molar fraction, getting the maximum short -circuit current density (J sc) of 135 \u00b5A/cm2 \nwhen the ternary composition is 35%. With the aim to increase the SBSC efficien cy the number \nof AlGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs layer system was varied, obtaining 20% more efficiency with 20 periods \nin contrast with the SBSC without quantum wells.

For this reason, in recent years solutions have been sought to \nreduce or mitigate these emissions, one of the proposals is the use of biofuels. One of the main \nbiofuels used is biodiesel which is a mixture of monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty  acids, this \nbiofuel is sustainable, renewable, biodegradable, non -toxic , helps reduce the emission of \ncarbon dioxide, and completes de carbon cycle.

The Raman spectra of the samples obtained by the classical \nsolid -state r eaction consist of four modes, while the spectra of the samples obtained by the two -\nstep method consist of six modes, where the appearance of two new IR modes F 1u(\u03bd3) and F 2g \n(\u03bd4) is associated to oscillations in the perpendicular plane to the basal plane of the structure.  \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n261  \n \n[ RWE -425 ] Rotating cylinder electrochemical reactor for removing Cr (III) \nfrom real effluents  \nBeatriz Elena Bonola Barrientos (betybonola27@gmail.com) 2 , Issis Claudette Romero Ibarra 2 , Jorge Gabriel V \u00e1zquez Arenas \n(jorge_gva@hotmail.com) 1  \n1 Centro Mexicano para la Producci \u00f3n m\u00e1s Limpia, Instituto Polit \u00e9cnico Nacional, Av.

Nevertheless, the Cr(III) sulfate \nbasic is the most us ed reagent in the tanning process at the commercial level due to its excellent features to tan the \nleather and low cost. The treatment methos of wastewater containing Cr(III) include: reverse osmosis, adsorption, \nbioadsorption, ionic exchange and chemical precipitation. Although these processes can achieve removal efficiencies \naround 98 %, they present important drawbacks like no combining a low cost along with a high efficiency or a short \nresidence time, besides most of these processes have been developed for synthetic solutions, whence they do not \nundergo the same challenges as real effluents containing complex matrices inhibiting the removal efficiency of \nphysicochemical processes. Specifically, the electrochemical techniques have been seldom used to remo ve Cr, \nmembrane electrolysis has been efficiently applied to remove Cr (VI) but this technology is considerably expensive.  \nIn this work, an alternative treatment was proposed for the removal of chromium with an approximate concentration \nof 3586.25 mg L-1 present in effluents from the tanning industry, through the electrochemical precipitation process. A \nrotating cylinder electrode (RCE) electrochemical reactor was used. The rector was made up of an anode (1018 carbon \nsteel), two different types of cathodes:  (1) (TiO 2/RuO 2) cathodes, called dimensionally stable cathodes (DSC) or (2) 316L \nSS (stainless steel) cathodes and a reference electrode. Stirred at 300 RPM was applied by means of a variable revolution \nmotor. For this type of process, two types of soluti ons were analyzed: a synthetic solution with an initial concentration \nof 2700 (mg L-1) and a real solution from the tannery industry with a Cr (III) concentration of 3585 (mg L-1), with a pH of \n3.55, and three different current densities (10, 20 and 30 mA cm-2). Finally, the initial pH value was proposed to be \nincreased to values of 5 and 6 for the real solution, since the electrochemical precipitation of Cr (III) was not favorable \nat the original pH of the wastewater from the tannery industry, approximatel y at 3.55, in contrast to the synthetic \nsolution with a pH value of 2.8.  \nDifferent experimental parameters were calculated, such as: chromium (III) removal, current efficiency and energy \nconsumption during the electrochemical precipitation process, to know the optimal conditions of the electrochemical \nreactor. Cr(III) -pH fracti on diagrams help on understanding that Cr 2FeO 4 (s) and Cr 2O3 (s) precipitates are the most \ndominant species at pH > 3.5 in these sulfate solutions, in the absence and presence of Iron, respectively. The influence \nof the cathode material occurs particularly  at current densities below 20 mA cm-2, where Cr removal kinetics proceeds \nfaster on the TiO 2/RuO 2 electrode than 316L SS.Residence times of 80 min and 60 min were necessary to remove all Cr \n(III) concentration at pH 5 and 6, respectively. The characteriza tions of the precipitates were carried out by X -ray \ndiffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the electroprecipitation mechanism, it was confirmed that \nthe precipitates were formed mainly by Cr2FeO4 (Chromite) regardless of the experimen tal condition used in the Cr (III) \nremoval process. They were developed for the two types of cathodes at a current density of 30 mA cm-2 and with the \ntwo modifications of the pH value 5 and 6, an elimination of 99.99% in times less than 60 min.  \nKeywords: Chromium removal, Cr(III), Tanning wastewater, Electro -precipitationIron dissolution.  \nAcknowledgment : The authors acknowledge the financial support from SECTEI CDMX -MEXICO (grant CM 048/2022) \nand CONACyT.

The addition of an energy level between the conduction band (CB) and the valance band \n(VB) of semiconductor originates the concept of intermediate band (IB) which allows the \nabsorption of photons with a lower energy than the VB to  CB transition in solar cell devices [1]. \nIn the obtention of IB, the GaNAs material has been studied and applied by the division of the \nconduction band into two energy levels called E - and E + which can be used in the concept of IB, \nthe most promising pro perty. In this work we analyze a set of p -i-n GaAs heterostructures grown \nby molecular beam epitaxy where a 10 and 20 periods of GaAs/GaNAs/GaAs quantum wells were \nembedded. The diffraction of [004] plane obtained by rocking curve method indicated two peak s \nintensities who dominates the diffractogram which correspond to GaAs and GaNAs, denoting \nthat strain increases with the number of layers by lattice mismatch. Raman spectroscopy was \nemployed to analyses the composition of the photovoltaic structure where modes related to \nGaAs and GaNAs were observed as indicative of the success of the grown process. The LO -\nphonon mode frequency was employed to estimate the strain of the heterostructure when their \nfrequency is contrasted with those of an unstressed sample, obtaining tensile values of 0.003. \nPhotoreflectance spectroscopy was used to determine the effect of tensile strain in the \nheterostructure where third -derivative lineshapes are found related to E - and GaAs gap. The \nstrain redshifts these critical points. A dditionally, the line shape on photoreflectance spectrum \nindicates that the electric field distribution is also modified by the quantum wells structures.  \nKeywords: Schottky barrier solar cells, technology computer aided design, GaAs -wells.    \nAuthor for cor respondence:  irving.cortes@uaslp.mx  \n[1] https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2017.08.036   \nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of FRC -UASLP, COPOCyT, and CONACYT -Mexico \nthrough grants: INFR -2015 -01-255489, CB 2015 - 257358, PNCPN2014 -01-248071, Fideico miso \n23871, and Investigadoras e Investigadores por Mexico (Project No. 44).   \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n264  \n \n[ RWE -125 ] STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF NANOSTRUCTURES ON \nKESTERITE SOLAR CELLS UNDER THE RADIATIVE LIMIT  \nKARINA GABRIELA RODRIGUEZ OSORIO (karina.osorio@academicos.udg.mx) 1 , MAYKEL COUREL \nPIEDRAHITA 1  \n1 Departamento  de Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Centro Universitario de los Valles, Universidad de \nGuadalajara  \nThe nanostructure application  to solar cells has been of growing interest in recent years, \nparticularly for less toxic, affordable supply,  and high efficiency potential materials. \nCu2ZnSn(SSe) 4 (CZTSSe) semiconductor material is presented as a competent candidate, whose \nproperties allow it to advance towards its maximum theoretical efficiency of 28%.

Recently, much research has been done on the \nsynthesis and applications of vanadium oxide in areas like: photocatalysis, solar cells, gas \nsensors, smart windows, and batteries. In this work, vanadium oxide (VO x) nanostructures were \nachieved using a hydroth ermal method, the effects of time and concentrations on the purity of \nthe obtained phase were explored in the process. We successfully prepared VO x, at different \nammonium metavanadate (0.015, 0.1 and 0.15M) concentrations in 25 ml of distilled water and \nstirred for 30 minutes. Hydrogen peroxide was added into the previous solution (10 V:1 H 2O2) \nand stirred 15 minutes until the solution turned yellow, then nitric acid was added drop by drop \nto obtain pH 2 and stirred for 15 minutes until a color change on th e solution to orange was \nobserved. Subsequently the solution was transferred to a 25 ml autoclave and heated at 180\u00b0. \nSeveral experiments were carried out at different temperature ranges (8 to 36 hours). The \nobtained precipitates were washed with distilled  water and ethanol, dried at 150\u00b0C and calcined \nat 500\u00b0C for 1 hour. The structural and morphological properties of the VO x was analyzed via X -\nray diffraction (DRX), Raman spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), while \noptical properties were e valuated by FTIR and UV -Vis. The XRD pattern shows that all calcined \nsamples are crystalline, corresponding to orthorhombic phase of V 2O5 (PDF -00-041-1426) and \nsecond phases are not present. Raman and FTIR show the presence of V -O and V=O bonds, \nwhich are reported for the V 2O5 structure. A platelet structure was observed in SEM microscopy. \nThe band gap energy of the samples were calculated by UV -Vis spectroscopy, obtaining values \nin the range of 2.3 -2.4 eV for all samples.  \nKeywords: Vanadium, hydrothermal m ethod, vanadium oxide, characterization, synthesis.  \nCorresponding autor:  roacostav@outlook.com  \nAcknowledgements : This work was supported by IPN under projects 20221569 and 20220673 \nand SECTEI under project CM 059/2021.  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n266  \n \n[ RWE -398 ]  Synthesis and electrical characterization of \nnanostructured gadolinium doped cerium oxide thin films \nobtained by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis for solid oxide fuel cells  \nUlises Gardu \u00f1o Ter \u00e1n (ugardunot1800@alumno.ipn.mx) 2 , Irlanda Carre \u00f1o Carmona \n(irlandac c12@gmail.com) 2 , Emmanuel Amador Maldonado 2 , Mario Fidel Garc \u00eda S\u00e1nchez 2 , \nGuillermo Santana 1  \n1 Instituto de Investigaciones en Materiales, U.N.A.M., A.P. 70 -360, Coyoac \u00e1n, C.P. 04510, Ciudad de \nM\u00e9xico, M \u00e9xico.  \n2 Unidad Profesional Interdisciplinaria en Ingenier \u00eda y Tecnolog \u00edas Avanzadas.

In this work, gadolinium doped cerium oxide thin films were prepared by Ultrasonic \nSpray Pyrolysis. The influence of gadolinium concentrations of 10, 15 and 20%, substrate \ntemperatures of 425, 450 and 475\u00baC and flow rates of 0.5 and 1. 0 L / min, 1.0 and 1.5 L / min and \n1.5 and 2.0 L / min for carrier and director gases respectively were evaluated. The structural, \noptical and electrical properties were characterized by X -ray diffraction, UV -vis spectroscopy, \nscanning electron microscopy,  and impedance spectroscopy. Variations in temperature and air \nflows modify the morphology, grain size and texture of the films. Increasing the temperature of \nthe substrate produces an increase in the band gap of materials, but does not substantially \nmodif y the activation energy, except for samples grown at 10% Gd. The activation energy for ion \nconduction increases considerably when using low flows (0.5 and 1.0 L / min for the carrier and \ndirector gases respectively). The better conditions for obtaining hom ogeneous and fracture -free \nfilms with low conductivity activation energies are substrate temperatures of 450 \u00b0C and flow \nrates of 1.0 and 1.5 L / min flows for carrier and director gases respectively.  \nKeywords: gadolinium, characterization, thin, film.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  irlandacc12@gmail.com  \nThis work was supported by  IPN under project 20220673 and SECTEI under project CM \n059/2021.  \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n267  \n \n[ RWE -288 ] THERMAL STUDY OF ZIRCONIUM DIOXIDE TO \nOBTAIN TETRAGONAL PHASE AND ITS POTENTIAL APPLICATION \nIN PHOTOCAT ALYTIC DEGRADATION OF INDIGO DYE  \nKarina Guadalupe Ramirez Maldonado (karinaram2512@gmail.com) 1 , V\u00edctor Hugo Castrej \u00f3n \nS\u00e1nchez (vic110579@hotmail.com) 1 , Nidia Garc \u00eda Gonz \u00e1lez 1  \n1 Ingenier \u00eda en Materiales ,Tecnol \u00f3gico de Estudios Superiores de Jocotitl \u00e1n, M\u00e9xico \nThe last few decades, environmental pollution has demonstrated a world -wide problem. \nPollution can present as a solid, liquid and gas or a mixture of them, altering in a negative way \nto the environment, causing  health problems and affecting quality of life.

However, the \nreported experimental record efficiency is far from the corresponding theoretical value . Multiple \nworks have been directed to increase the value of the efficiency of these devices, but as far as \nwe know, studies related to losses due to the reflection of the incident radiation or the effects \nof the reticular decoupling of the constituent lay ers of the solar cells in the formation of \ninterfacial states have not been addressed systematically.

An alternative \nthat can combat Climate Change is green hydrogen, produced by water electrolysis, which can \nbe powered by renewable energies and accordingly not generate any polluting atmospheric g as. \nIn addition, Mexico can take advantage of the large number of Combined Cycle Power Plants it \nhas to implement a partial mix between natural gas and hydrogen. In this way, the emissions \nproduced by the combustion of natural gas would be reduced, since h ydrogen only generates \nwater vapor. It would also be taking advantage of the country's high potential for the \ndevelopment of photovoltaic solar energy for the use of electrolysis. An intensive search of 84 \nCombined Cycle Power Plants existing in Mexico was  carried out, a comparative table was made \nthat includes the name of the plant, the location, its total capacity (MW), global energy generation \n(GWh), and type of turbine. gas installed. As a case study in a first stage, the Central Agua Prieta \nII plant wa s chosen, to carry out an analysis of implementing hydrogen enrichment to the natural \ngas line. This plant has a suitable location to take advantage of the solar potential and to install \nan electrolyser to generate green hydrogen. The available land of the  plant itself was considered \nto size the solar park.  \nKeywords: Combined cycle plants,  green hydrogen.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  irlandacc12@gmail.com  \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n271  \n \n[ RWE -409 ]  Fast Microwave -Assited Hydrothermal Synthesis Of BiVO4 Microstructures \nDecorated With Au Nanoparticles For Ciprofloxacine Photocatalytic Degradation  \nEric Fernando V \u00e1zquez -V\u00e1zquez (fernando.vazquezv@cinvestav.mx) 1 , Issis Claudette Romero -Ibarra 2 , Oscar Eduardo \nCigarroa -Mayorga (ocigarroam@ipn.mx) 2  \n1 Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Polit \u00e9cnico Nacional, Av.

The BiVO 4 has a low \nbandgap energy (~2.41 eV), which promotes the photocatalytic reactions for decomposition of \npollutants and water splitting in the visible ran ge of electromagnetic spectrum. Nevertheless, \nthe recombination rates of the photogenerated charges restrict its applicability. Therefore, a \nheterojunction with Au plasmonic nanoparticles (AuNPs) can overcome this issue. AuNPs can \nwork as a tramp for photo -induced electrons. In addition, AuNPs absorbs visible light due to \nlocalized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The present work aims to take advantage of BiVO 4 \nphotocatalytic properties and enhance light absorption with AuNPs nanorods growth on the \nsurfac e of the photocatalysts for the further formation of an Au/BiVO 4 heterostructure.   BiVO 4 \nwas synthetized by the microwave assisted hydrothermal synthesis which allows reaction time \nreduction to just 30 s. X ray diffraction demonstrate monoclinic BiVO 4 as the main phase. SEM \nand TEM show nanostructures of ~100 nm long and 50 nm wide, with shape of nanobars and \ncharacteristic lattice planes of the BiVO 4. On the other hand, AuNPs were synthetized by the \nseed method to have a better control on shape and size of  the nanoparticles. UV -Vis \nspectroscopy demonstrates AuNRs typical absorption bands due to longitudinal and transverse \nLSPR. SEM and TEM confirmed nanorods shape. Modification of seed method allowed growth \nof AuNRs on the surface of the photocatalyst provi des a simple and repeatable method for the \npossible formation of the heterostructure. The absorption spectra showed the absorption bands \nof AuNRs and BiVO4, and TEM confirms the heterostructure and planes that allow its formation. \nTo determine the improvem ent of the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4, the photodegradation of \nciprofloxacin (CIP), a highly present contaminant in wastewater, was evaluated using the \nphotocatalyst with and without AuNRs decoration illuminated with a visible light lamp (xenon \n150 W ). The CIP degradation using BiVO 4 was 40% after 2 h. The results show that surface \nmodification of photocatalysts with metallic nanoparticles is a potential application for \ndegradation of CIP in wastewater treatment plants, in addition to the use of a gre en method for \nthe synthesis of the photocatalyst.  \nThe authors thank financial support by  Proyecto SECTEI 048/2022, Proyectos para la \nInnovaci\u00f3n en el IPN 2021, CONACyT and BEIFI -IPN scholarships.  \nKeywords: BiVO 4, Au nanorods, microwave assisted hydrothermal synthesis, BiVO 4/Au, \nphotocatalysis.    \nCorresponding author:  ocigarroam@ipn.mx   \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n272  \n \n[ RWE -27 ] Ge incorporation in kesterite thin films by solution \nprocessing route and its use in solar cells  \nDavid Mora -Herrera (dmora@ifuap.buap.mx) 1 , Mou Pal 1 , Jose Santos -Cruz 3 , Sadasivan Shaji 2  \n1 1Instituto de F \u00edsica, BUAP, Av.

Herein, we report a promising solution -processing deposition method for the \ncontrolled incorporation of germanium (Ge) in Cu 2ZnSnS 4 (CZTS) films using a nontox ic \nmolecular ink. The effect of Ge concentration in the precursor solution on structural, optical, \nelectrical and electronic properties of the films were systematically investigated. The successful \nGe alloying in CZTS was confirmed by XRD analysis and expl oring the sensitivity of Raman \nscattering. The as -synthesized Cu 2ZnSn 1-xGe xS4 (CZTGS; x = 0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.25) films exhibit \nstrong absorption in the visible region with the gradual increment in the band gap energy from \n1.46 to 1.61 eV by increasing  x from 0 to 0.25. A decrease in Urbach energy at higher [Ge]/[Sn + \nGe] ratio supports the reduction of overall disorder into the system. The information about the \ncorrect oxidation states of the constituent elements and optimal chemical composition of the  \nCZTGS films was obtained from X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The decrease in \nSn+2/Sn+4 signal ratio with the increase in Ge further supports the suppression of deep -trap Sn Zn \nantisite defects. The XPS valence band spectra reveal that the position  of valence band \nmaximum ascended from 0.09 to 0.15 eV with increasing Ge content in the films. The solar cell \nwas fabricated with a stack structure of FTO/TiO 2/CdS/CZTGS/C. The efficiencies of CZTGS films \nat the Ge percentages of 0% and 15% were 0.17 and 0.33%, respectively.   \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n273  \n \n[ RWE -96 ] Impedance spectroscopy analysis of semi -\ntransparent inverted ITO/TiO2/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS organic \nsolar  \nAbraham M \u00e9ndez Res \u00e9ndiz (abraham.mendez@cimav.edu.mx) 1 , Sergio Alfonso P \u00e9rez Garc \u00eda 1 , \nLiliana Licea Jim \u00e9nez 1  \n1 Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  en Materiales Avanzados S.C.

Among these features, \nsemitransparency allows the devices to be integrated into  buildings as windows or facades \ntaking advantage of the already available areas, turning semitransparent OSCs into a promising \nway to harvest solar energy. To achieve this application, spray coating deposition stands as a \nprocessing method that meets the requirements of being simple, scalable, and compatible with \nlarge area deposition and it can be used to obtain different layers of the OSCs. In these \nmultilayer systems, the electrical properties of the materials and interfaces have a major impact \non the p erformance of the final device. In this study, the spray coating technique was used to \nobtain deposits of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) as electron transport layer (ETL), regioregular poly(3 -\nhexylthiophene):[6,6] -phenyl -C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) blend as photoactive \nlayer and poly(3,4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate  (PEDOT:PSS) as the anode to \nachieve inverted OSCs with the structure ITO/TiO 2/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS. Different systems by \nvarying the thickness of each layer were obtained and characterized by I -V curves and \nimpedance analysis under illumination. The I -V characteristics and electrical properties from \nNyquist plots of the different devices are discussed. The results show the potential of impedance \nspectroscopy to characterize  OSCs to understand different operating processes and optimize \nthe performance of the devices.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n274  \n \n[ RWE -431 ]  Indirect electrochemical degradation of \nacetaminophen: process performance, pollutant \ntransformation, and matrix effects evaluation  \nRicardo Enrique Palma Goyes (ricardo.palma@correounivalle.edu.co) 1  \n1 Departamento de Qu \u00edmica, Universidad del Valle  \nAcetaminophen (ACE) and its toxic transformation products have been found in surface \nwastewater, and drinking water, which has several environmental concerns, was degraded in \naqueous matrices (distilled water and synthetic fresh urine) by reactive chlorine  species (RCS) \nelectrogenerated using Ti/IrO 2 electrodes. Initially, the effect of the current (10 -40 mA) and ion \npresent in surface water and wastewater (Cl - or SO 4-2) on the electrochemical system was \nevaluated. Then, the kinetics, and byproducts transfo rmations involved in the elimination of ACE \nwere described. It was found that, in distilled water, the process at 40 mA in NaCl presence led \nto 100 % of ACE degradation (10 min, 0.056 Ah L -1). Theoretical analyses of atomic charge for \nACE indicated that th e amide group is the most susceptible to attacks by RCS such as HOCl. On \nthe other hand, degradation of acetaminophen in the synthetic fresh urine was slower (21% of \ndegradation after 60 min of treatment) than in distilled water. This was attributed to the  other \nsubstances in the urine matrix, which induce a competition for the degrading RCS. Results \nobtained from this work are promising for practical applications because short reaction times \nand low current densities are needed for degradation of ACE and i ts oxidation products.  \nKEYWORDS : Electrochemistry, Chlorination, Pharmaceuticals, Water treatment.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  ricardo.palma@correounivalle.edu.co  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n275  \n \n[ RWE -402 ]  Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) in \nsupported liquid membranes (SLM) for CO2 separation.  \nJos\u00e9 Antonio Raya Col \u00edn (antoniopp08@gmail.com) 2 , Jos\u00e9 Ort\u00edz Landeros 1 , Carlos G \u00f3mez Y \u00e1\u00f1ez 1 , \nIssis Claudette Romero Ibarra 3  \n1 Escuela Superior de Ingenier \u00eda Qu \u00edmica e Industrias Extractivas -ESIQIE -Instituto Polit \u00e9cnico \nNacional  \n2 Escuela Superior de Ingenier \u00eda Qu \u00edmica e Industrias Extractivas -ESIQIE -Instituto Polit \u00e9cnico \nNacional -Av.

CO 2 capture or adsorption is one of those \npossible applications, where DES can act as greener alternative to the amine -based solvents that \nare currently being used in carbon capture and storage (CCS) processes. Deep eutectic solvents \nare defined as a mixture of two or more components, which may be solid or liquid and that at a \nparticular composition present a high melting point depression becoming liquids at room \ntemperature. When the compounds that constitute the DES are primary metabolites, namely, \naminoacid s, organic acids, sugars, or choline derivatives, the DES are so called natural deep \neutectic solvents (NADES). NADES fully represent green chemistry principles. In this work, \ndifferent choline chloride DES were prepared, and CO 2 gas transport coefficients  were \nmeasured. Two types of NADES were prepared by mixing and heating of hydrogen bond \nacceptor (choline chloride) with either urea, glucose, tartaric and ascorbic acid as hydrogen bond \ndonor. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed t he hydrogen bond \ninteractions in the resulting NADES. The NADES based supported liquid membranes were \ninvestigated systematically to determine the permeability and selectivity for the mixture of gases \nat both ambient and elevated temperatures. The DES were  immobilized in a TiO 2-rutile \nmacroporous support, and the pure gas permeability of 3 different gases (N 2, CO 2 and CH 4 ) was \nassessed, as well as NADES supported liquid membranes ideal selectivity.   \nThe effect of operating temperature on membrane performan ce was also investigated that \nmakes them an appropriate alternative to the conventional ILs  \nKeywords: Natural deep eutectic solvents, Membrane separation, CO 2 separation  \nThis work was supported by  CONACYT and   Beca de Est\u00edmulo Institucional de Formaci\u00f3n de  \nInvestigadores ( BEIFI -IPN), special thanks to Dr. Jos\u00e9 Ort\u00edz Landeros, Dr. Carlos G\u00f3mez Y\u00e1\u00f1ez \nand Dra.

However, the use of these \nmaterials carries some serious environmental and economic concerns due to the toxicity and \nscarceness of some of  the constituents. The increasing energy demand from recent years arises \nthe need for novel materials for applications in solar cells but without negative effects. Tin \nselenide (SnSe) is a non -toxic and affordable semiconductor that has drawn the attention  of \nresearchers owing to its high absorption coefficient which makes it suitable for solar cell \napplications. Nevertheless, so far TFSCs based on this material have not achieved efficiencies \nthat can contribute to satisfy the increasing energy demand. Sign ificant effort has been made to \ntackle the problem of low efficiency in SnSe -based TFSCs which includes theoretical studies and \nmore particularly modeling. In this work, losses due to radiative and non -radiative \nrecombination mechanisms over the photovolta ic characteristics of a solar cell with \nAu/SnSe/CdS/ITO structure with ideal and non -ideal series and shunt resistances are evaluated \nusing SCAPS 1 -D. Additionally, different parameters are varied for optimization employing a \npreviously reported SnSe -based  TFSC as the starting point for modeling. The influence of \nparameters such as absorber (t SnSe) and buffer (t CdS) layer thicknesses, the density of defects at \nthe absorber (N t) and at the absorber -buffer interface (N ts), as well as shallow acceptor density \n(NA) has been taken into account for device optimization. Result of this analysis, it has been \nshown that non -radiative recombination mechanisms due to volume defects in SnSe have the \nmost detrimental effect on solar cell characteristics including efficiency. Also, for an ideal \nresistance device with t SnSe and t CdS of 1.7 Micra and 50 nm, N t, N ts, and N A  around 1x1016 cm-3, \n1x106 cm-2, and 2x1019 cm-3, respectively, it is possible to achieve an efficiency of 21. 89 % under \nAM 1.5 G illumination at 300 K.  \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n277  \n \n[ RWE -167 ] PHOTOCATALYST FLOATING COMPOSITE USED FOR \nDYES DEGRADATION  \nV\u00edctor Hugo Castrej \u00f3n S\u00e1nchez (victor.castrejon@tesjo.edu.mx) 2 , Ma. \u00c1ngeles Enr \u00edquez P \u00e9rez 2 , \nJaime Rosales D \u00e1valos 1  \n1 Ingenier \u00eda Mecatr \u00f3nica, Tecnol \u00f3gico de Estudios Superiores de Jocotitl \u00e1n, Carretera Toluca -\nAtlacomulco km 44.8, Ejido de San Juan y San Agust \u00edn, Jocotitl \u00e1n, M\u00e9xico, M \u00e9xico.  \n2 Ingenier \u00eda en Materiales, Tecnol \u00f3gico de Estudios Superiores de Jocotitl \u00e1n, Carretera Toluca -\nAtlacomulco km 44.8, Ejid o de San Juan y San Agust \u00edn, Jocotitl \u00e1n, M\u00e9xico, M \u00e9xico.  \nFloating photocatalysts have caused interest due to the benefits they provide. One of the main \nadvantages of the floating support, is its characteristic lightness and flexibility; while the \nphotocat alyst is able to interact with sunlight without the need of stirring or oxygenation, \nbecause the composite remains on liquid\u2019s surface. In this work, a floating photocatalyst based \non a TiO 2 / agglomerate composite has been prepared.

The present work is about the synthesis, characterization, \nand fabrication of graphene integrated AgSbS 2-xSex absorber material[1]. Graphene -Se \nnanocolloids were synthesized  by laser irradiation of selenium and graphene powders in \nisopropyl alcohol. Then the graphene -Se nanocolloids were spin -coated over the Sb 2S3-Ag \nprecursor layers synthesized by chemical bath and thermal evaporation method respectively. \nThese films were he ated in a vacuum furnace under different heating conditions. Optical \nabsorption spectra revealed a red shift for graphene integrated AgSbS 2-xSex films compared to \npure AgSbS 2-xSex. Photocurrent response indicated one order increment in the photocurrent \nvalue in graphene integrated films. Solar cells were fabricated with a device structure \nglass/FTO/CdS/AgSbS 2-xSex: graphene/Ag. The device showed a power conversion efficiency of \n3.5% which is higher compared to the reference solar cell fabricated with AgSbS 2-xSex. The \ncomplete study of structural, morphological, and opto -electric properties of the graphene \nintegrated AgSbS 2-xSex films and photovoltaic performance of the fabricated solar cells will be \npresented at the conference.  \nKeywords: Graphene, AgSbS 2-xSex films, Se nanocolloid, opto -electric properties, solar cells  \nCorresponding author:  kbindu_k@yahoo.com, krishnan.bindu@uanl.edu.mx  \n[1] Y.

One of the problems concerning this technology is the \npresence of the multivalence element Sn, w hich forms oxidation states +II and +IV, where in \nparticular Sn2+ results in recombination centers that degrade the open -circuit voltage of the \ndevice. The partial or total replacement of Sn by Ge has been proposed as an interesting \napproach to solving thi s problem. In particular, the total replacement of Sn by Ge in the \nCu2ZnSnSe 4 (CZTSe) compound forming Cu 2ZnGeSe 4 (CZGSe) material results not only in the \nincrease of band -gap from 1.0 eV to 1.35 eV but also increases the open -circuit voltage since it \ninhibits the formation of Sn2+ estates. Therefore, CZGSe semiconductor constitutes an attractive \nmaterial for solar cell application. However, experimental efficiencies reported for this \ntechnology are still low. In this work, we present results on numerical c alculations on CZGSe \nsolar cells by SCAPS. The purpose of the work is to study the main limiting factors of this \ntechnology. The impact of defects at bulk and interfaces on solar cell performance is analyzed \nand discussed.     \nKeywords: Kesterite solar cel ls, CZGSe, solar cell simulation, SCAPS  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n283  \n \n[ RWE -401 ]  Synthesis of bismuth ferrite (BFO) via a solution combustion \nmethod and its catalytic evaluation on the sonochemichal assisted \ndegradation of emerging contaminants (EC).  \nAnel Ivonne Robles Cortes (anivo.roblester@gmail.com) 2 , Issis Claudette Romero Ibar ra 2 , Jos\u00e9 Ort\u00edz Landeros 1  \n1 Escuela Superior de Ingenier \u00eda Qu \u00edmica e Industrias Extractivas - Av.

In fact, water \ncovers at least 71% of the earth\u2019s surface, yet only 1% of it is suitable for human consumption. \nFor quite a time now, water shortage has become an alarming  issue and it wasn\u2019t until recently \nthat efforts have been made to develop and improve technologies to ensure water safety. One \nof the areas many research has focused in is waste water treatment. Where many chemicals \nsuch as medicines, personal care, house hold cleaning products, agricultural, cosmetics, etc., are \nmaking their way \u201csilently\u201d in to water and waste water sources mainly because the \nconsequences of such presence, have not yet been fully noticed (or were previously found in \nlesser concentrations) .  We refer to these compounds as emerging contaminants (EC) and due \nto the difficulty of removal in water treatment plants they represent an important environmental \nproblem and health risks.This study explores the synthesis, characterization and catalytic  \nevaluation of a bismuth ferrite (BFO) catalyst prepared via a solution combustion approach using \nbismuth nitrate Bi(NO 3)3 \u00b05H 2O , ferric   nitrate Fe(NO 3)3 \u00b09H 2O, HNO 3 as precursor salts and urea \nas a fuel. The effect of different metal nitrate/ organic co mpound molar ratios has been studied \nin order to evaluate their suitability in obtaining pure BFO powders. The obtained powders were \ncharacterized by X -ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron \nmicroscopy (SEM). The band gap and su rface area of the catalyst was also determined using a \nUv-Vis Nir spectrophotometer and the N 2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were obtained \nusing BET analysis. The catalytic activity of the synthesized BFO powders was evaluated on the \nsonochemical ass isted degradation (SAD) of EC under various conditions including photo \ncatalyst concentration, initial EC concentration and pH variation. The results reveal that a BFO \nphoto catalyst was successfully obtained in 2.5h at 550 \u00baC. The powders obtained showed high \nBFO phase content and smaller crystallite size.   \nKeywords: BFO, sonochemestry, emerging contaminants, water remediation, solution \ncombustion.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  anivo.roblester@gmail.com  \nThis work was supported by : The MATEA research team gui ded by Dra.

This architecture is known as bulk \nheterojunction (BHJ) and creates a larger inte rface area than in a planar heterojunction, so that \nan electric field in the vicinity of the interfaces of donor and acceptor materials is distributed \nthroughout the volume of the active layer and a more effective charge separation is achieved. \nDue to the deposition method, BHJ architectures with irregular morphologies are obtained since \nthe random mixing nature of the donor and acceptor during solution processing [1].   In order to \nunderstand and improve the performance of organic solar cells, here we propo se an approach \nthat uses an algorithm to generate BHJ architectures with irregular random disordered \nmorphologies [2] to theoretically analyze the effect of the donor/acceptor ratio on device \nperformance.

The band gaps were evaluated with the help of the experimental \ntransmittance datas using the Tauc model, the results shown a modulation of the band gap \nvalues with the incorporation of ZnO.

This water has as final disposal rivers, seas,  and lakes. However, all these \ncontaminants are treated in wastewater treatment plants through primary and secondary \nmethods, without achieving their complete mineralization. For this reason, it is necessary to \nimplement new techniques and materials to ach ieve the complete mineralization of these \norganic contaminants. In this work, binary solid solutions of bismuth oxyhalides of chlorine and \niodine of different compositions (Bi 4O5ClXIY, X+Y=2) have been easily obtained through the \nsynthesis method by precip itation at room temperature using non -toxic precursors. The effect \nof the composition has been studied through different characterization techniques, such as \nSEM, EDS, DRS and  XRD. These binary solid solutions have been found to exhibit photocatalytic \nactivity under visible light. The results confirm the successful obtaining of the binary solid \nsolution, and not a mixture of phases. In addition, the compounds showed band gap energies \nfrom 2.40 to 2.85 eV and an absorption edge shift from 391 to 501 nm, maki ng their activation \npossible under visible light. Depending on the application, the modulation of its band gap is \npossible, therefore, it could be applied to many organic pollutants.  \nKeywords:  Bismuth Oxyhalide, Bismuth Oxyiodide, Bismuth Oxychloride.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n290  \n \n[ SEM -209 ] Analysis of ZnO co -doping with Sb and Teflon  \nEduardo Oswaldo Mendo P\u00e9rez (eduardo.mendo@alumno.buap.mx) 3 , Gabriel Ju\u00e1rez D\u00ed az 2 , \nPrimavera L\u00f3pez Salazar 1 , Janet Ram\u00ed rez M\u00e1rquez 3 , Javier Mart\u00ed nez Ju\u00e1rez \n(javier.martinez@correo.buap.mx) 3  \n1 Centro de Investigaciones en Dispositivos Semiconductores, Instituto de Ciencias, Benem\u00e9rita \nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla, Edif.

IC6 Ciudad Universitaria, Puebla, Pue., C.P.  72565  \nABSTRACT : Optic, structural and electric properties of Zinc Oxide (ZnO) has been studied \nbecause of its application for optoelectronic and spintronic devices. Achieving stable p-type \nconductivity of ZnO has been a difficult challenge in recent years  due to the low solubility, low \nenergies of formation of the donor levels compared to the acceptor levels, and self -\ncompensation, which causes the conductivity to revert to n-type within days, even hours, being \nthis phenomenon the most challenging issue. I n the present work the possibility of controlling \nthe physical properties of ZnO by means of diffusion process was studied. Single crystal wafers \nof ZnO with orientation (001) growth by hydrothermal method were subjected to solid diffusion \nprocess with Ant imony and subsequently subjected to thermal treatment with Teflon, seeking \nto achieve the diffusion of Fluorine and/or Carbon. In this way, a codoping of two or three \nelements is attempted to study their behavior and optic properties of ZnO. Characterizati on of \nphysical properties of samples was performed using Photoluminescence (PL), optical \ntransmittance and Raman microscopy. Structural characterization was performed by High \nResolution X -Ray Diffraction (HRXRD) analysis. In PL analysis, the goal is to und erstand the \ncontribution of Antimony and Teflon, as well as the characteristic defects play in ZnO \noptoelectronic properties and important changes in PL signal about band associated to defects \nof Zn anti -sites. In Raman microscopy analysis, finding the bon ds present in the ZnO crystal \nlattice, looking for signs of bonds with foreign elements and understanding their influence is of \ngreat importance. In HRXRD analysis, the changes in crystal quality and the lattice constant are \nlooked for to determine the pre sence of impurities in the lattice. Impurity diffusion process \nproduces alterations in crystal lattice, associating to deeper diffusion.  \nKeywords : Zinc Oxide, co -doping, Antimony, defects, Teflon.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  javier.martinez@correo.buap.mx   \nThis work  was supported by 100127044 -VIEP2021 Project and  1037807 Conacyt Scholarship  \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n291  \n \n[ SEM -370 ]  Annealing effects on the optical properties of thin \nfilms GaNAs:Sn layers grown by MBE  \nP.

Thus, the study of mechanism to improve the \noptoelectronic properties of the GaNAs alloy by in -situ and ex -situ techniques is imperative. In \nthis res earch, GaN 0.02As0.98 layers were grown by Molecular -Beam Epitaxy on intrinsic GaAs(100) \nsubstrate. The addition of tin atoms was controlled by the tin effusion cell temperature (T Sn) in \nthe 700 to 850 \u00b0C range. With this n -type doping strategy the in -situ optimization of the ternary \nis searched. Additionally, Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) was applied for 60 seconds at 800 \u00b0C \nto modify the structural properties of the sample as ex -situ scheme. The behavior of the GaNAs \nproperties before and after the RTA was  analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, where an increase \non the  relation was observed, indicating an improvement on the carrier concentration for T Sn > \n750 \u00b0C. The LO mode presents a redshift related with a strain state on the lattice, increasing with \nthe RTA. The effect of annealing in the band structure of the alloy was also analyzed by \nphotoreflectance spectroscopy where a redshift of the transition related  was measured. \nAdditionally, the spectral region of Franz -Keldysh oscillations was modified toward high er \nfrequencies, as an indicative of modification on the carrier distribution of the samples. Through \nthis research project, both in - and ex -situ methods are proposed to optimize GaNAs alloy to \ntheir application in the photovoltaic devices.  \nKeywords: GaNAs,  Rapid Thermal Annealing, Photoreflectance, Raman.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  irving.cortes@uaslp.mx  \nhttps://doi.org/10.1063/1.5111965  \nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of FRC -UASLP, COPOCyT, and CONACYT -Mexico \nthrough grants: INFR -2015 -01-2554 89, CB 2015 - 257358, PNCPN2014 -01-248071, Fideicomiso \n23871, and Investigadoras e Investigadores por Mexico (Project No. 44).   \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n292  \n \n[ SEM -153 ]  BAND GAP VARIATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF \nTHIN FILMS OF THE TERNARY SEMICONDUCTOR CDSXSE1 -X \nGROWN BY LASER ABLATION.  \nBlanca Estela Zendejas Leal (blanca@fis.cinvestav.mx) 1 , Carlos V\u00e1zquez L\u00f3pez 1 , Jaime Santoyo \nSalazar 1 , Jorge Ricardo Aguilar Hern\u00e1n dez 2  \n1 Departamento de F\u00ed sica, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico \nNacional, Av.

Among these materials, In xSey is an \nn-type semiconductor with a bandga p of 1.8 -3.2 eV, which is very promising to replace CdS. On \nthe other hand, CuInSe 2 is a highly studied semiconductor, which can be used as absorbing \nlayers in photovoltaic devices, showing great promise for charged particle detectors. In xSey and \nCuInSe 2 thin films were synthesized in a multisource thermal coevaporation facility using a \nKnudsen  cell, where the substrate temperature was maintained between 300 and 400 \u00b0C, and \nthe Knudsen cell temperature was deposited depending on the material. The In xSey film is \ndeposited on the conducting oxide of SnO 2:F and the CuInSe 2 layer on the In xSey film.The \nstructural and morphological properties of each In xSey and  CuInSe 2 layer were investigated by X -\nray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron m icroscopy (SEM). From the \nresults obtained, gamma and beta phase bands can be observed in the In xSey Raman films. As \nfor CuInSe 2, a mixture of CuSe and InSe binary phases was identified by XRD, and binary bands \nwere observed by Raman. In conclusion, it is possible to study the morphological and structural \nlayers of In xSey and CuInSe 2, obtaining favorable results for their application in charged particle \ndetectors.  \n \nKeywords: layers, In xSey,CuInSe 2, morphological and structural.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  trinitymm90@gmail.com  \nThis work was supported by project SIP 20221307 and 20221713.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n294  \n \n[ SEM -434 ]  CHARACTERIZATION OF THERMAL PROPERTIES OF \nInP QUANTUM DOTS FOR APPLICATIONS AS INFRARED \nPHOTODETECTORS  \nJessica L\u00f3pez -Gonz\u00e1lez 2 , Mar\u00ed a Lucero G\u00f3mez -Herrera (lucero.gomez@uaq.mx) 2 , Daladier Alonso \nGranada -Ram\u00ed rez 1 , Julio G.

These QDs can be fabricated by sophisticated and expensive growth \ntechniques such as MBE and MOCVD, and also by more simple and less expensive methods such \nas ch emical synthesis and sputtering. In this work we report on the synthesis of indium \nphosphide (InP) QDs by means of the one -pot chemical synthesis process without injection of \nhot precursors; these InP QDs are obtained in colloidal solutions and the QDs siz es are \ncontrolled by adjusting the synthesis parameters such as temperature, precursors \nconcentrations and the pH of the solution. Because of the quantum confinement effects, the \nbandgap energy of the QDs will depend on the QD size, in such a way that the fluorescent \nwavelength of the InP QDs can be controlled by their size. In their application for infrared \nphotodetectors, we make use of the electron intraband transitions in the conduction  band \nwhose energy separation will depend on the QD size. In this wo rk we report on the \ncharacterization of the structural and optical properties of InP QDs and their variation with QD \nsize; also, we show results  on the variation of the QDs thermal conductivity  with QD  size, since \nthis parameter is important to obtain good  eficiency in the infrared photodetectors.  \n \nKeyword:  Quantum dots, Semiconductors, Thermal properties, Photodetectors  \nAuthor for correspondence:  gomez@uaq.mx  \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n295  \n \n[ SEM -137 ] Comparison of thermodynamic stability of the GaSb \nsubstrate in contact with Ga(Al) -rich and Sb -rich AlGaSb liquid \nphases  \nAndrei Gorbatchev (andre@cactus.iico.uaslp.mx) 1 , Francisco De Anda 1 , Viatcheslav Michournyi 1 , \nLuis Francisco Avenda\u00f1o Anastasio 1  \n1 IICO UASLP, Av.

Estimations were made using the CALPHAD \nmethod and SGTE data. Initially, it is shown that the saturated ternary AlGaSb liquid phase of \nany composition becomes overheated when it is brought in contact with the GaSb substrate. \nThe overheating temperature increases with the A l concentration in the two types of liquid \nphases and reaches slightly higher values for Sb -rich liquid phases. Overheating of the liquid \nphase causes dissolution of some quantity of the substrate and results in the supersaturation \nof the liquid phase lead ing to the deposition of some quantity of a solid phase forming an \nepitaxial layer. The relationship between the quantities of dissolved and deposited materials \npermits to estimate the thermodynamic stability of the substrate. The thermodynamic stability \nof the GaSb substrate decreases monotonically in contact with the Sb -rich liquid phase as the Al \ncontent increases. In the case of Ga(Al) -rich liquid phase, the thermodynamic stability has a well -\ndefined minimum at some Al concentration that decreases notic eably and shifts towards the \nGaSb rich side at higher temperatures but it never exceeds the values achieved by the Sb -rich \nliquid phase. From these results we can conclude that the GaSb substrate is more \nthermodynamically stable in the case of contact with  Ga(Al) -rich AlGaSb liquid phase as \ncompared with a Sb -rich liquid. This fact can be used in liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) processes to \nform heterostructures with sharper boundaries between epitaxial layers.   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n296  \n \n[ SEM -285 ]  EFFECT OF SOL -GEL PROCESS PARAMETERS ON \nQUALITY AND PROPERTIES OF SNS THIN FILMS  \nArturo M\u00e9ndez -L\u00f3pez (arturo.mendez@uaq.mx) 1 , Manuel Toledano -Ayala 1 , Osvaldo Valdez -Cruz 1 , \nYuliana de Jes\u00fas Acosta -Silva (yuliana.dejesus.acosta@uaq.mx) 1  \n1 Divisi\u00f3n d e Investigaci\u00f3n y Posgrado, Facultad de Ingenier\u00ed a, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Quer\u00e9taro \n(UAQ), Centro Universitario, Quer\u00e9taro, Qro. 76010, M\u00e9xico.  \n \nIn the present work, SnS thin films were deposited by dip -coating method.

An \nepitaxial growth allows obtaining cr ystals of very high quality. In recent years, the discovery of \ngraphene (G) has innovated many aspects of science and technology. Van der Waals (VdW) \nepitaxy was developed by studying the behavior of bonds that exist in two -dimensional \nmaterials. In this w ork, the use of quasi -Van der Waals (qVdW) epitaxy is reported, which consists \nof depositing a bulk material on Graphene [1]. The objective is to study the structural, surface, \nand vibrational properties of GaAs layers grown on G/GaAs(100) and G/Si(100) by  the closed \nspace vapor transport technique (CSVT). Graphene was obtained by chemical vapor deposition \n(CVD) on copper, then it was transferred on Si(100) and GaAs(100) substrates. The graphene was \nanalyzed with Raman spectroscopy. The characteristic G and  G' peaks of a graphene bilayer (G) \nwere found at 1569 and 2709 cm-1 respectively. The GaAs layers grown on G/GaAs(100) and \nG/Si(100) substrates were characterized using Raman, X -ray diffraction and scanning electron \nmicroscopy techniques. Finally, we foun d the LO and TO modes of GaAs at 292 and 269 cm-1 \nrespectively. This is a growth of GaAs cheaper.  \nKeywords:  GaAs, CSVT, Graphene, Quasi Van der Waals epitaxy, Graphene on silicon, \nHeteroepitaxy  \nAuthor for correspondence:  angel.martinezlpz@cinvestav.mx  \n[1] Y.

A solution is a layer device approach on a low -cost \nsubstrate. The CSVT method has been successfully used to grow a variety of semiconductor \nmaterials including homo -and hetero -epitaxial GaAs  layers. This technique has some \nadvantages compared to the other ones as they are a low -cost manufacturing technique that \nallows the deposition of layers at atmospheric pressure and moderates temperatures. Here, it \nis reported, GaAs layers grown via CSVT.  GaAs layers were grown varying the deposition time (5 \nand 13 min), the substrate (Si and quartz) and the substrate chemical cleaning (RCA or HF). Under \nthese conditions and through morphological, structural and topographic characterizations, the \nGaAs laye r grown on a Si (100) substrate previously subjected to RCA chemical cleaning for 13 \nmin stood out. By XRD, three major diffraction peaks at 27.29\u00b0 45.36\u00b0 and 53.70\u00b0 were observed, \nwith the peak at 27.29\u00b0 being the most intense. Regarding the chemical comp osition, 53.5% of \nGa and 46.5% of As in at% were determined by EDS analysis. An increase in grain size was noted \nin the SEM micrographs as the growth conditions were optimized. Meanwhile, in the Raman \nspectrum of the GaAs layers, both TO and LO vibrational  modes were presented. However, as \nthe growth parameters were varied, the intensity of the LO mode exceeded the intensity of the \nTO mode, indicating fewer defects in the material. This was confirmed by determining the \nFWHM, which changed from an initial va lue of 6.56 cm-1 to a value of 3.80 cm-1.      \n \nKeywords: Low-cost substrates, GaAs, CSVT  \nAuthor for correspondence:   jc_bueno17@hotmail.com  \nReference : [1] J.J.

This \nstudy presents th e synthesis of semiconductor thin films of pure cadmium sulfide and doped \nwith metals by the chemical bath deposition technique.

The doped CdS thin films \nreveal differences in the size of the crystallite, differences in morphology, and the energy \nbandgap shows a shift. The implementation of dopants allows the design of materi als, this \nenables the design of window layers by choosing the suitable dopant for the CdS. Due to the \nincorporation of determinate dopants, the photoresponse of the doped CdS Schottky diodes \nimproved.  \nThe Schottky diodes manufactured in this work show vari ation in height of the potential barrier. \nThese results demonstrate the impact of dopants on the characteristics of craft materials and \nphotodiodes elaborated, exhibiting an enhancement in their photoresponse.

Cd 1-xNixS samples, with Ni atomic percentage (at%) in the 0.0 \u2264 x \u2264 \n0.74 interval, were grown with average crystallite size (CS) in the 18 -20 nm range. Pre sence of \nNi2+ ions in CdS lattice alters interplanar spacing (IS) and CS, which in turn introduce changes in \nthe energy band gap (E g), phonon modes (PM), photoluminescence (PL), dark electrical \nconductivity ( \u03c3), among other properties. Changes are due to the relatively high ionic radius ( R) \ndifference between Cd and Ni ( RCd = 78 pm, RNi = 54 pm). IS increases and CS decreases as Ni2+ \nconcentration rises to x ~ 0.4, afterwards the behavior is inverted up to x = 0.74. This result is \ndue to the incorporation of Ni2+ in Cd2+ sites for low x values, and in interstitial sites for higher \nones. As consequence, the vibrational longitudinal optical (1LO) mode frequency first diminishes \nup to x ~0.4 and then increases for higher x values. Similar dependence is observe d for direct \nband gap (E g) of CdS films. PM -1LO and E g versus x behavior, both, follow an inverted function \nthan expected, which is explained in accordance with results found in literature.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n301  \n \n[ SEM -385 ]  Influence of Cu and substrate temperature on CIS \nthin films processed by thermal coevaporation  \nM-Fernanda Garc\u00ed a-Mej\u00eda (fermari_game@hotmail.com) 2 , Daniel -C Palacios -Hern\u00e1ndez 2 , Jorge \nSastr\u00e9 -Hern\u00e1ndez 2 , Marcelino Becerril -SIlva 1 , Jorge -R Aguilar -Hern\u00e1ndez 2  \n1 Cinvestav  \n2 ESFM -IPN \n \nThe CIS films were deposited with different growth parameters by thermal coevaporation \ntechnique: Cu temperature variation and substrate temperature variation.

Nonetheless, there is \nanother form of plasmons in certain materials: the bulk plasmon. T hese plasmons are described \nas oscillations of free carriers into the material; for this reason, they can be excited by long -\nwavelength radiation (red wavelength). Also, they can be coupled to another quasiparticle, \nphonons. The oscillating nature of bulk plasmons (longitudinal), allows them to couple with \nlongitudinal optic (LO) phonons, creating two modes known as L - and L+ coupled modes. The L - \nmode presents the same frequency as the transversal optic (TO) mode [1]. Therefore , the \nvibration detected at t he TO frequency is a contribution of two effects, the TO and the L - mode, \na compound mode very difficult to separate. On the other hand, the L+ mode varies with carrier \nconcentration as does plasma frequency. Thus, if the L+ mode is found, the carrier conc entration \ncan be estimated. This work  proposes a method to estimate the carrier concentration using the \nL+ coupled mode in n -type In 0.14Ga 0.86As0.14Sb0.86 layers. By studying the dielectric function, the \nRaman shift frequencies of the coupled modes were ca lculated and, Raman spectroscopy was \nused to determine the vibrational and coupled modes in the samples in the range 160 -1000 cm-\n1. In order to verify the carrier concentration found in n -type In 0.14Ga 0.86As0.14Sb0.86 layers by \nRaman, photoluminescence spe ctroscopy (PL) was employed to estimate these concentrations; \nboth techniques gave the same results. The methods presented here  are alternatives to the Hall \neffect technique and are non -invasive, non -destructive, and cheaper.  \n \nKeywords: phonon -plasmon coupling, plasma frequency, Raman spectroscopy, carrier \nconcentration.  \n[1] Maslar, J.

The band gap engineering is the \nbasis that co nfers the advantageous properties of HS. However, the experimental realization of \nthese structures faces several problems such as differences in atom\u2019s electronegativity and \nlattice mismatch. The former is the main responsible for the generation of disloca tions due to \nstrain relaxation, defects that reduce the performance of the devices, and that strongly depend \non the composition of the HJ and HS layers. In this work, the authors explore the structural and \noptical properties of metamorphic compositional gr aded layers of InGaAs grown on GaAs by \nmolecular beam epitaxy (MBE). X -ray diffraction patterns (HRXRD) showed diffraction peaks \nassociated with GaAs, In concentration alloy at which the graded samples started at, and a wide \nplateau associated with the gra ded metamorphic layer. It is found that the gradual accumulation \nof strain is suddenly relieved at ~540 nm when reached a nominal concentration of In=42%. The \nthickness matches the fastest change in In concentration within the film, as experimentally \ndeter mined by spectrometry of masses (SIMS). Photoluminescence spectroscopy showed \nintensity lines at 0.58 and 0.82 eV associated with band -to-band transitions from the dislocation \nfree zone, assisted by the relaxation of photoexcited carriers close to the near -surface band \nbending of the graded concentration layers. Finally, the strain promoted the generation of \ndislocations, In segregation, and surface roughness. But, conversely to linear or step -graded \nlayer profiles, for metamorphic layers these phenomena de pend on the strain direction (tensile \nor compressive), and alloys hardening occurs provoked by In in the region of the larger positive \ngradient in composition.  \nAcknowledgments:  The authors acknowledge the facilities granted by the Laboratorio Nacional \nde A n\u00e1lisis Fisicos, Qu\u00edmicos y Biol\u00f3gicos/UASLP, and financial support from FRC -UASLP, \nCONACYT -Mexico and COPOCyT Fideicomiso 23871.  \nAuthor for correspondence:   victor.mendez@uaslp.mx   \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n305  \n \n[ SEM -218 ]  NANOSTRUCTURED CU -CR-O POWDERS: \nCOMBUSTION SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION  \nMiguel Aguilar (maguilarf@ipn.mx) 2 , Cruz Paredes 4 , Ismael Gardu\u00f1o 1 , Gilberto Alarc\u00f3n 2 , Antonio \nCalder\u00f3n 2 , Luis Lartundo 3  \n1 C\u00e1tedra -Conacyt -Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional , Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Ciencia Aplicada y \nTecnolog\u00ed a Avanzada Unidad Legaria, Calz.

The purpose to have such options of optical sensors on this work is to \nintroduce a bulk heterojunction for building organic sensors in the NIR  constructed from this \nbulk heterojunction on flexible substrates of indium tin oxide, using polymeric materials as a \nsemiconductors and low melting point metal contacts such as indium gallium (InGa) alloy and \nsome metals as Ag, Ni. The performance of orga nic photodiodes of poly(hexylthiophene) P3HT \nand fullerene phenyl -C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) can be determined by its optical \nand electrical characterization, which are carried out using I -V curves and UV VIS spectroscopy \non these devices to obse rve the displacement of the curve as well as the average \ntransmittance to visualize the possibility of obtaining a sensor in the near infrared region. The \noptical behavior of the polymer is discussed in the visible spectrum as well as the dark \nelectrical r esponse of the bulk heterojunction and as a function of the incident wavelength \nabove the device. We can observe that the P3HT transmits from the infrared up to about \n600nm while the PC 61BM has not contribution on the visible spectrum. regarding the electr ical \ncharacterization I -V, we can find that the photogenerated currents has a lineal shift when the \nincident wavelength increases, and we approach to the near infrared region. We conclude that \nthe organic photodiodes constructed with these materials serves  as optical sensors in the NIR, \nsince their transmittance increases from 600nm to the near infrared region, as well as the shift \nin the photogenerated current in the I -V curve is lineal as the wavelength approaches to that \nregion.  \n \nKeywords:  Bulk Heterojun ction, Organic Photodiodes, Polythiophene, Photogenerated \nCurrents, Near Infrared  \nHrostea, L., Girtan, M., Mallet, R., & Leontie, L.

In this task, the GaNAs material is used as IB material for the \nbehavior that its electr onic structure of bands acquires, being the division of the conduction \nband into two energy levels called E - and E+ the most interesting properties for photovoltaics \n[1]. However, both the lattice mismatch between GaAs and GaNAs and the carriers\u2019 mobility are \ndegraded by increasing the nitrogen molar concentration percent (%N). In this work, the authors \nexplore the grown process and the optical characterization of GaNAs layers where tin is \nemployed as donor atoms with the aim to increase the optoelectronic response of this material. \nMBE is utilized to obtain 500 nm wide GaNAs layers grown on GaAs (100) with two different %N \naround 0.2 and 2, labeled as A and B set of samples, respectively. The n -type doping level was \ncontrolled by the tin effusion cell tempe rature, exploring the range from 700 to 850 \u00b0C. The high -\nresolution x -ray diffraction spectra of the [004] plane obtained by rocking curve shows %N \nvalues of 0.12 and 1.9%, for samples A and B, respectively and indicating an appropriated grown \nprocess. Add itionally, the crystallinity of the material is not degraded by the addition of Sn, \nobtaining an unexpected result. Raman spectra exhibits modifications in vibrational modes \nrelated to both the %N and Sn incorporation in GaNAs. L - and LO phonon integrated intensities \nwere employed to determinate the donor atoms concentration by the depletion layer \nestimation, showing the range from 6x1016 to 6x1018 cm-3. For similar Sn effusion cell \ntemperature, the B set of samples exhibits a higher donor concentration in contrast with the A \nseries. These results were corroborated by four -point probe method, demonstrating the change \nin conductivity for the samples with tin atoms concentration.  With this study the authors show \nby first time the employment of Sn as donor elem ent in the GaNAs alloy.  \nKeywords: G aNAs thin doped, Raman Spectroscopy, HRXRD, Molecular Beam Epitaxy.    \nAuthor for correspondence:  irving.cortes@uaslp.mx  \n[1] https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4709405  \nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of FRC-UASLP, COPOCyT, and CONACYT -Mexico \nthrough grants: INFR -2015 -01-255489, CB 2015 - 257358, PNCPN2014 -01-248071, Fideicomiso \n23871, and Investigadoras e Investigadores por Mexico (Project No. 44).   \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n310  \n \n[ SEM -307 ]  Optical, structural, and surface chemical \ncharacterization of In2O3 nanoparticles and quantum dots of \nInP@ZnS.  \nD.A.

The absorption spectra present a primary \nshoulder around 380 nm for the InP and 440 nm for the case of InP@ZnS. Using this wavelength \nthe band gap energy of the InP and InP@ZnS QDs was determined . It can be observed that the \ndiffractograms present a typical form of a nanostructured material. Diffraction peaks are \nidentified with the crystalline phase of the InP. ZnS offers zinc blended (FCC) type, located in the \nplanes (111) and ( 311). In additio n, the phases of In 2O3 can be observed in the planes (211). \nFrom the photoluminescence spectra, we observed QDs emission peaks at 2.1 eV for InP; and \nfrom 1.9 eV to 2.2 eV for InP@ZnS QDs; also, we observed a decrease in the PL emission due to \ndefects gene rated by the In2O3 formation. Charge carrier lifetime measurements for the \nnanoparticles of In2O3 were achieved, obtained with the time -resolved photoluminescence \ntechnique, indicating that the dominant mechanisms for recombination are the non -radiative \nrecombination processes.   \nKeywords: Quantum dots, InP, InP@ZnS  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n311  \n \n[ SEM -389 ] Photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A by \nHAp/TiO2 composite  \nDiego Victor Benitez Maldonado (diego.benitezm@viep.com.mx) 1 , Esmeralda Garc\u00ed a D\u00edaz 2 , Javier \nMart\u00ed nez Ju\u00e1rez 1 , Mar\u00ed a Josefina Robles \u00c1guila (josefina.robles@viep.com.mx) 1  \n1 Benem\u00e9rita Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla, Instituto de Ciencias, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en \nDispositivos Semiconductores, Ciudad Universitaria, Puebla, Pue, C.

BPA is of \nparticular interest due to its use in the plastic industry and its capacity to act as an endocrine \ndisruptor. Hydroxyapatite (HAp) has been widely studied due to its similarity with bone tissue \nand its bio compatibility. However, recent investigations have shown its potential use in \nadsorption and photocatalysis of emerging pollutants. In the photocatalysis field, TiO 2 has been \nwidely researched for this purpose. For these reasons, the HAp/TiO 2 composite was synthesized \nby a mechanical method and tested in the photocatalytic activity against BPA. The HAp/TiO 2 \ncomposite was analyzed by X -ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and diffuse reflectance \nspectroscopy (DRS). During the photocatalyt ic experiments, UVA light was used ( \u03bb=350 nm). The \nHAp/TiO 2 composite showed 92% of BPA total removal after 4 hours. Furthermore, the \nreusability of the composite was tested for 5 cycles. In these experiments, the composite showed \na decrease in the photoca talytic activity, where 30% of total BPA removal was achieved in the \nlast cycle after 3 hours of experiment. Finally, radical trapping experiments were conducted \nusing isopropanol (IPA), p -benzoquinone (BQ), ammonium oxalate (OA), and silver nitrate \n(AgNO 3). Radical trapping experiments revealed that the superoxide radicals (O 2-) were the \nmajor active specie responsible for BPA degradation. The present work shows that the HAp/TiO 2 \ncomposite is a promising material for photocatalysis.  \nKeywords:  Photocatalysi s, bisphenol A, hydroxyapatite, TiO 2, UVA light.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  josefina.robles@viep.com.mx  \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n312  \n \n[ SEM -280 ] PROPERTIES OF CERIUM DIOXIDE THIN FILMS \nPREPARED DIP COATING METHOD  \nManuel Toledano -Ayala 1 , Yuliana de Jes\u00fas Acosta -Silva (yuliana.dejesus.acosta@uaq.mx) 1 , Yasmin \nEsperanza L\u00f3pez Serna (yasmin12345yas@gmail.com) 2 , Osvaldo Valdez -Cruz 1 , Arturo M\u00e9ndez -\nL\u00f3pez 1  \n1 Divisi\u00f3n de Investigaci\u00f3n y Posgrado, Facultad de Ingenier\u00ed a, Universidad Aut\u00f3n oma de Quer\u00e9taro \n(UAQ), Centro Universitario, Quer\u00e9taro, Qro. 76010, M\u00e9xico.  \n2 Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Quer\u00e9taro, Av.

By XRD, a change from \nmonocrystalline structure to polycrystalline structure was observed in the doped CdS thin films, \nmaintaining the zinc blende crystalline phase as dominant; this behaviour was confirmed by \nHRTEM micrographs in addition to the different levels of quantum confinement promote d by \neach incorporated transition metal. By Raman scattering confirmed the zinc blende crystalline \nphase and also allowed the analyses of the phononic interactions of the CdS binary compound, \nwhere the Raman shifts give structural information and confirm t he effects of quantum \nconfinement. The UV -visible optical spectroscopy describes the effect of the crystalline structural \nmodifications with blue shifts in the optical band gap energies of the evaluated samples, related \nwith the different levels of quantum  confinement given by the metal dopants.  \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n318  \n \n[ SEM -144 ] Synthesis and Characterization by Colloidal and \nMicrowave process on MnSb2O6 nanoparticles.  \nAndrea Elizabeth Becerril Talavera (andrea.becerril4785@alumnos.udg.mx) 1 , Hector Guill\u00e9n Bonilla \n3 , Jorge Alberto Ram\u00ed rez Ortega 3 , Ver\u00f3nica Mar\u00ed a Rodr\u00ed guez Betancourt 4 , Alex Guill\u00e9n Bonilla 5 , Jos\u00e9 \nTrinidad Guill\u00e9n Bonilla 2 , Lorenzo Gildo Ortiz 1  \n1 Departamento de F\u00ed sica, Centro Universitario de Ciencias Exactas e Ingenier\u00ed as, Universidad de \nGuadalajara, Blvd - M.

Chromium concentrations varied for different molar ratios ranging from 2, 4, and \n8 %. After  thin film depositions on glass substrates at room temperature, the samples were post -\nannealed in the air at 450 \u00b0C for 60 min. The samples' structural, optical, and surface chemical \nproperties were characterized by several techniques, including E.D.S., XR D, SIMS, Raman, UV -Vis, \nRT-PL, and XPS spectroscopies. The XRD patterns showed that all the films are polycrystalline \nwith pure anatase structure and the crystallite sizes decrease with chromium doping.  \nMoreover, the anatase phase formation was confirmed f rom Raman spectra analysis. \nConcerning the optical properties of the samples, the UV -Vis absorption spectra showed a red \nshift in the absorption edge in the visible range, following the doping concentration of Cr. In \naddition, the RT -PL study revealed that  the dopant incorporation causes a decrease in the P.L. \nintensity. The E.D.S. and SIMS analysis associated with the elemental composition of the samples \nshowed that Ti, O, and Cr elements are present in the sample. On the other hand, from XPS \nmeasurements,  the Ti4+ oxidation states of Ti 2p evidenced the formation of TiO 2.  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n320  \n \n[ SEM -151 ]  SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MgSb\u00e2\u201a\u201aO\u00e2\u201a\u2020 \nNANOSTRUCTURES BY COLLOIDAL METHOD ASSISTED BY MICROWAVE \nRADIATION.  \n \nAndrea Carolina Gallegos Reyes (andrea.gallegos4732@alumnos.udg.mx) 1 , H\u00e9ctor Guillen Bonilla \n(hector.guillen1775@academicos.udg.mx) 1 , Lorenzo Gildo Ortiz 1 , Jos\u00e9 Trinidad Guillen Bonilla 1 , \nJorge Alberto Ram\u00ed rez Ortega 1 , Mar\u00ed a Ver\u00f3nica Rodr\u00ed guez Betancourtt 1 , Alex Guillen Bonilla 2  \n1 F\u00edsica, Universidad De Guadalajara, Boulevard Marcelino Garc\u00ed a barrag\u00e1n 1421, Guadalajara, \nJalisco, C.

It is of great importance to \ncontrol the size and shape of the trirutile particles for the response of different gases. Thus, it is \nnecessary to study new synthesis techniques for more efficient mi crostructure control. The \nChemical methods as sol -gel, bio -assisted synthesis, among others, are less expensive and allow \nbetter control of size and shape. In the present investigation, it was proposed to synthesize and \ncharacterize magnesium antimony (MgS bO) following a synthesis process using the colloidal \nmethod and the microwave radiation (MW) assisted solution route, since it is a fast, uniform and \neffective method, which allows increasing the kinetics reaction by one or two orders of \nmagnitude. The Co lloidal nanoparticles are synthesized from metal precursor salts dissolved in \nhomogeneous solutions ranging from 2 ml to 5 ml of Ethylenediamine (CHN), with a drying of \nthe solution at 200 \u00b0C and subsequently calcined, to analyze and compare by X -Ray Diffr action, \nthe pattern of the MgSbOO oxide powders. The morphology and size of the nanoparticle was \nverified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission (TEM).  \nKeywords: gas detectors,the MgSbO oxide powders colloidal method, trirutile structure, \nsencivity.  \nCorresponding author : andrea.gallegos4732@alumnos.udg.mx  \nReference:  [1]Alex Guill\u00e9n Bonilla1*, H\u00e9ctor Guill\u00e9n Bonilla2, Ver\u00f3nica Mar\u00eda.

This work describes the preparation of barium antimoniate (BaSb 2O6) \nnanostructures using a microwave assisted wet chemical method. To  synthesize this \nsemiconductor oxide, the reagents \u2014antimony trichloride (SbCl 3) and barium nitrate \n(Ba(NO 3)2)\u2014 as well as the chelating agent (ethylenediamine), were dissolved in ethyl alcohol. \nFrom this, three solutions were obtained, which were then mix ed and left stirring for 24 hours \nat room temperature. Afterwards, the solvent was evaporated using low -power microwave \nradiation until a precursor paste was obtained, which was then dried at 200 \u00b0C for 8 hours [1]. \nThe product was subsequently calcined at  800 \u00b0C and characterized using X -Ray diffraction. This \nanalysis led to the discovery of an hexagonal crystal structure with cell parameters a = 5.303 \u00c5 \nand c = 5.758 \u00c5, and a P -31m (162) space group. By scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and \ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM), there were also discovered nano -plates (0.70 \u2013 4.00 \n\u03bcm) and particles with a medium size of 2.00 \u00b1 0.704 \u03bcm.

CdS and Sb 2S3 are well known for their use as \nwindow (CdS) or absorber (Sb 2S3) layers in  thin film solar cells. Thus, combining these \nchalcogenides with nanocrystalline particles can result in enhanced physical properties for the \nnanocomposite systems.  \nThe physical properties of the fils were studied by UV -Vis and Raman spectroscopies, X ray \ndiffraction, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Photoluminescence spectroscopy.

The filament of the bulbs is made of pure tungsten, it \nis possible to recover it and at the same time it contributes in the decrease of the waste of bulbs \ndisposed in landfills which contaminate the water, soil an d air. The conventional industrial \nmethod to obtain WO 3 uses dangerous reagents and long reaction times.

TMDs \nmonolayers are direct semiconductors, a few atoms thick, chemically stable at room \ntemperature , they have very strong optical absorption, and possess electronic degrees of \nfreedom not available in regular semiconductors such as spin coupling to the wavevector, \nunrestricted capabilities to form heterostructures from the point of view of lattice matc hing \n(since the 1D layers couple to each other only through van der Waals forces, not covalent bonds), \nwide tunability of their bands due to strain and due to the formation of microscopic moir\u00e9 \npatterns. They seem thus to be ideal to be  the main components  of ultra -compact \noptoelectronic devices with novel functionalities working at room temperature. In this work, we \ndemonstrate the efficient production of TMDs monolayers of high crystalline quality and size of \na few hundred nanometers by liquid exfoliation  (LE) using a solution of ascorbic acid and water. \nLE is suitable for applications where it is necessary to cover large substrate areas with material. \nWhile other techniques such as to CVD or mechanic exfoliation, for example, can produce \nmonolayers of ten s or even hundreds of micrometers, LE is a much simpler technique which \nallows to deposit the active material on any substrate simply by drop -casting. An inherent \ndrawback of LE is the presence of solvent residues which are difficult to remove and affect t he \nelectronic properties of the material or post -fabrication processes. Our technique based on the \nuse of ascorbic acid, water and ethanol  allows to completely get rid of such residues. This opens \nthe way to the use of TMD obtained by liquid exfoliation i n optoelectronic applications such as \nmicrocavity -based devices.  \n \nKeywords : 2D materials, transition -metal dichalcogenides, liquid exfoliation   \nAuthor for correspondence:   edgar.cerda@uaslp.mx  \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n329  \n \n[ SEM -329 ]  VERTICALLY STACKED MoS2 -ReS2 AND ReS2 -MoS2 \nHETEROSTRUCTURES FOR BROADBAND PHOTODETECTION  \nB\u00e1rbara Alejandra Mu\u00f1iz Mart\u00ed nez (barbara.muniz@cinvestav.mx) 2 , Gowtham Polumati 3 , Chandra \nSekhar Reddy Kolli 3 , Mario Flores Salazar 1 , Parikshit Sahatiya 3 , Andr\u00e9s de Luna Bugallo 1  \n1 CFATA UNAM -Juriquilla, Boulevard Juriquilla 3001, Fraccionamiento Real de Juriquilla, 76230 \nQuer\u00e9taro, Qro  \n2 CINVESTAV Quer\u00e9taro, Libramiento Norponiente 2000, Fraccionamiento Real de Juriquilla, 76230 \nQuer\u00e9taro, Qro  \n3 Departme nt of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus, 500078 \nHyderabad, India  \nMolybdenum disulphide (MoS 2) and rhenium disulphide (ReS 2) are members of transition metal \ndichalcogenides (TMDs) family which has shown great potential for diverse applications in \nelectrical, optical and quantum devices due to its intrinsic mobility, direct band gap and \nelectronic structure. We present a study of the structural and optical properties of vertical MoS 2-\nReS 2 and ReS 2-MoS 2 heterostr uctures (HS) grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for \nbroadband photodetection. A two -step CVD process was used to form the HS: first, MoS 2(ReS 2) \nmonolayer crystals are grown in a CVD chamber at 750 \u00b0C on SiO 2/Si substrates, then the sample \nis introduc ed in a second CVD chamber to perform ReS 2(MoS 2) growth. Optical and SEM images \nshow the formation of vertical MoS 2-ReS 2 and ReS 2-MoS 2 HS. Raman spectra performed on the \nvertically stacked HS show the typical A 1g and E\u2019 Raman bands of both materials with a ny \nsignificant shift suggesting a strong interlayer coupling. Moreover, photoluminescence \nmeasurements reveal the presence of both materials only when MoS 2 is stacked on ReS 2. Finally, \nthe optoelectronic characterization was performed to understand the ban d structure with \ncarrier migration mechanism of both heterojunctions. We demonstrate that for ReS 2 on MoS 2 \nthe responsivity reaches 80 A/W for visible light illumination, whereas the responsivity drops to \n14.12 A/W when MoS 2 is on top of ReS 2. These measur ements along with UPS complementary \ndata, indicate that ReS 2 stacked on MoS 2 results in a type I heterostructure with efficient light \nadsorption and rapid charge transfer. The responsivity of these devices fabricated with materials \ngrown by CVD is reasonab ly high compared with devices using low -end technique.  \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n330  \n \n[ SEM -336 ] ZnO NANOPARTICLES SYNTHESIS BY ASSISTED \nMICROWAVE IRRADIATION AND ITS APPLICATION IN \nPHOTOCATALYSIS.  \nRENE PEREZ CUAPIO (reneperezcuapio@gmail.com) 3 , J.

Numerous materials are \nreported in the literature for the solvent\u2019s detection as carbon nanostructures and porous \nmaterials as MOFS (metal -organic -frameworks). In this research work, a MIS cap acitor structure \nbased on mesoporous silica (MCM -41) is used to detect protic, aprotic polar solvents, and \nnonpolar solvents. The detection of the solvents was made through the evaluation of \ncapacitance -voltage characteristics. Our results correlated with molecular simulations using \ndensity functional theory (DFT) and electrical parameters. The surface of the MCM -41 is more \nsensitive to methanol than the other nonpolar solvents. These results suggest that it is possible \nto develop a solvent sensor using thi s low -cost MCM -41 MIS capacitor.  \nKeywords:  MIS capacitor, mesoporous silica, detector, solvents  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n334  \n \n[ SEM -145 ] Evaluation of InGaN/GaN heterojunction photo \ndetection obtained by PEALD  \nDylan Tepatzi Xahuentitla (dylan.tepatzi@alumno.buap.mx) 1 , Jose Joaquin Alvarado Pulido 1 , \nMelissa Chavez Portillo 2 , Denisse Cortes Salinas 1 , Salvador Alcantara Iniesta 1 , Daladier Alfonso \nGranada Ramirez 1  \n1 Benemerita universidad autonoma de puebla  \n2 Divisi\u00f3n de Ingenier\u00ed a Industrial del Tecnol\u00f3gico Nac ional de M\u00e9xico Campus Zacatl\u00e1n, Jicolapa, \nPuebla, 73310 M\u00e9xico  \n \nDylan Tepatzi * (https://orcid.org/0000 -0001 -5336 -1457 ) a \n(dylan.tepatzi@alumno.buap.mx)  \nJoaqu\u00edn Alvarado, (https://orcid.org/0000 -0001 -7186 -4429)a \nMelissa Ch\u00e1vez Portillo, (https://orcid.org/0000 -0002 -3491 -2759) b \nDenisse Cortes Salinas, (https://orcid.org/0000 -0001 -7014 -3523) a \nSalvador Alc\u00e1ntara -Iniesta, (https://orcid.org/0000 -0001 -9759 -9694)a \nDaladier Alonso Granada Ram\u00edrez, (https://orcid.org/ 0000 -0001 -9933 -4921) a \n  \na Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Dispositivos Semiconductores, Instituto de Ciencias, Benem\u00e9rita \nUniversidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla, Puebla, Puebla, 72570 M\u00e9xico.  \nb Divisi\u00f3n de Ingenier\u00eda Industrial del Tecnol\u00f3gico Nacional de M\u00e9xico Campu s Zacatl\u00e1n, Jicolapa, \nPuebla, 73310 M\u00e9xico  \nA good performance of n -GaN/n -Si y n -InGaN/n -Si heterojunction photodetector was \ninvestigated.

Monolayer \nMoS2 is deposited on SiO2/Si using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and SnS2 -QDs are \nprepared using a low -cost solution -processing method. The high performance of the fabricated \n0D/2D photodetector is ascribed to the band bending and built -in potential created at the \njunction of SnS2 -QDs and MoS2, which enhances the injection and se paration efficiency of the \nphotoexcited charge carriers. The mixed -dimensional structure also suppresses the dark \ncurrent of the photodetector.

However, this material is more scare and costly than silicon, which is nowadays the \nmost mature and commercialized technology on t he market.

This area has rapidly evolved over the years becoming \nfaster and more effective. However, the increasing and incessant requirements for instant \ninformation h ave forced worldwide researchers to develop new technologies that may allow \naccess to information of any kind at the instant. In this direction, THz technologies have been \nenvisioned with the potential to provide the new devices working at higher communica tion \nspeeds in the near future, and to achieve this goal novel THz radiation emitters are demanded.  \nThis work presents novel THz emitters based on InGaAs/GaAs alloys grown in gradual \nconcentration steps by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. It is demonstrated that \nthese devices exhibit higher emission compared to those emitters based on photo -conductive \nantennas. The two main effects responsible for the emission are the ballistic transport of the \ncarriers which acquire the kinetic energy from the energy difference between the excitation \nradiation and the band -gap, and the second effect is the acc eleration of the electrons, which is \nimproved by the modification of the surface electric field caused by the band -bending in the \nmetamorphic layer. To assure the ballistic transport it is important to maintain high crystalline \nquality throughout the growt h of the layer, and it implies having a low density of dislocations, \nwhich is not an easy task considering the 7% mismatch between the materials InAs and GaAs. \nConsequently, MBE appears as the preferred technique to synthesize these samples. \nAdditionally, to prompt carriers' acceleration, we propose novel designs on the emitter structure \ncomprising concave and convex concentration profiles. We observe that the emission of these \ndevices is twice higher than the conventional GaAs THz emitters.  \nAcknowledgments : The authors acknowledge the facilities granted by the Laboratorio Nacional \nde An\u00e1lisis Fisicos, Qu\u00edmicos y Biol\u00f3gicos/UASLP, and financial support from FRC -UASLP, \nCONACYT -Mexico and COPOCyT Fideicomiso 23871.  \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n339  \n \n[ SEM -44 ] Quantification of wz -inclusions in zb -GaN grown by \nPAMBE on GaAs by x -ray pole figures  \nRa\u00fal Trejo Hern\u00e1ndez (raul.hernandez@cinvestav.mx) 2 , Mario Alberto Zambrano Serrano 2 , \nMarlene Camacho Reynoso 2 , Marcos Macias Mier 2 , Salvador Gallardo Hern\u00e1ndez 2 , Yenny Lucero \nCasallas Moreno 1 , M\u00e1ximo L\u00f3pez L\u00f3pez (mlopezl@cinvestav.mx) 2  \n1 CONACYT -Unidad Profesional Interdisciplinaria en Ingenier\u00ed a y Tecnolog\u00ed as Avanzadas, Instituto \nPolit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Av.

However, zincblende nitrides suffer from wurtzite \ninclusions due to their metastable nature. It is therefore essential to quantify the amount of \nthese i nclusions if highly crystalline zincblende films are to be obtained. X -ray diffraction (XRD) \nallows quantifying the volume ratio between two phases by analyzing the intensities of \nreflections from the two said phases. Although this is mainly used for rando mly oriented \nsamples, it can also be applied to single -crystalline materials through the measurement of pole \nfigures [1]. This work analyzed zb -GaN samples grown through molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) \non (001) -GaAs substrates with XRD. Pole figures of the wz -(103) and zb -(113) were taken from \neach sample in a Rigaku SmartLab multipurpose system using the in -plane geometry. The \nfigures obtained were corrected for absorption and background using the Rigaku 3D Explore \nsoftware. Additionally, defocus corrections were carried out using a Si -powder reference \nsample. Once corrected, the integrated intensity was computed from the figures, and the ratio \nbetween the two was obtained, considering the structure factor, multiplicity, and diffraction \nangles for each reflect ion. The patterns of the pole figures obtained categorically confirm the \npresence of the zincblende phase in all samples when compared to simulations. However, the \nwurtzite phase is also shown to appear in varying percentages across the different samples. XRD \npole figures have been proven as a powerful technique to analyze wz inclusions in zb -GaN \nsamples grown by MBE on GaAs. They allow qualitative analysis using the pattern. Additionally, \nquantitative studies can be carried out to analyze phase ratios in a  mixed crystal.  \n \nKeywords:  XRD, Phase purity, Pole figure, Zincblende GaN, MBE growth  \nReference:  [1] M.

The solution of this problem and the improvement of the electrical and optical \ncharacteristics of thin films of perovskites is impossible without a compre hensive analysis of the \nmaterial, including chemical and structural analyses. In this paper, we performed a three -\ndimensional analysis of thin films of CH 3NH 3PbI 3 perovskite using a time -of-flight mass \nspectrometer. Perovskite films with a thickness of abo ut 200 nm were grown by spin -coting on \nglass substrates under different growth regimes. Depth profiling analysis showed a uniform \ndistribution of the main elements over the thickness of the film, except for a thin near -surface \nlayer (about 10 -20 nm). We di d not find diffusion of any elements from substrate for all analyzed \nsamples. The analysis of the mass spectrum allows us to conclude about the ionic nature of the \nbond in perovskite. Herewith the formation of secondary ions is described within the framewo rk \nof the bond breaking model. With an increase in the annealing temperature above 100oC the \nappearance of a second chemical phase in perovskite, defined as PbI 2, is observed in the surface \nchemical map analysis mode. The formation and growth of the relati ve concentration of this \nphase was confirmed by XRD as well. It looks the detected phase separation is one of the reasons \nfor the instability of perovskites over time. Analysis of the mass spectrum in the region of light \nions showed that the interaction of  accelerated ions with perovskites does not occur the same \nway as with silicon -type semiconductors: an additional mechanism of ion sputtering (additional \nto cascade sputtering) is observed, which has yet to be clarified.  \n \nKeywords: Perovskite, Spin Coating, TOF -SIMS, Phase Separation  \nAuthors thank to M.Sc.

The purpose to have such options of optical sensors on this w ork is to \nintroduce a bulk heterojunction for building organic sensors in the NIR constructed from this \nbulk heterojunction on flexible substrates of indium tin oxide, using polymeric materials as a \nsemiconductors and low melting point metal contacts such as indium gallium (InGa) alloy and \nsome metals as Ag, Ni. The performance of organic photodiodes of poly(hexylthiophene) P3HT \nand fullerene phenyl -C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) can be determined by its optical and \nelectrical characterization, which are carried out using I -V curves and UV VIS spectroscopy on \nthese devices to observe the displacement of the curve as well as the average transmittance to \nvisualize the possibility of obtaining a sensor in the near infrared region. The optical behavior of \nthe polymer is discussed in the visible spectrum as well as the dark electrical response of the \nbulk heterojunction and as a function of the incident wavelength above the device. We can \nobserve that the P3HT transmits from the infrared up to about 600nm wh ile the PC 61BM has not \ncontribution on the visible spectrum. regarding the electrical characterization I -V, we can find \nthat the photogenerated currents has a lineal shift when the incident wavelength increases, and \nwe approach to the near infrared region.  We conclude that the organic photodiodes constructed \nwith these materials serves as optical sensors in the NIR, since their transmittance increases \nfrom 600nm to the near infrared region, as well as the shift in the photogenerated current in \nthe I -V curve  is lineal as the wavelength approaches to that region.  \n \nKeywords : Bulk Heterojunction, Organic Photodiodes, Polythiophene, Photogenerated \nCurrents, Near Infrared  \nHrostea, L., Girtan, M., Mallet, R., & Leontie, L.

The hybrid plasma was created at a working pressure of 6 x 10-4 Torr. The use of the \nhybrid plasma allowed efficient laser ablation at low working pressures. Different samples were \ndeposited varying the laser power density on the aluminum target. The variation  of this power \nproduced ions of different mean kinetic energy (E k) of the laser ablation plasma. The values of \nthe mean kinetic ion energy were determined using a Langmuir planar probe and was used as \nthe working parameter. The composition of the AlN thin films was measured using the XPS \ntechnique. The measurements showed that the oxygen content in the films was as low as 2.5 \nat%, and most of the bonds between Al and N corresponded to that of the AlN. The band gap of \nthe samples was determined as a function  of the E k of the laser ablation plasma and was \nobserved to vary between 5.4 and 5.85 eV. Nano indentation measurements showed a variation \nof the hardness of between 23 and 30 GPa as a function of E k.

It is well known that th ese materials have unusual chemical and physical \nproperties.   Although XPS is the technique of choice for these surface -related applications, very \nfew studies have been done on metallic manganese and its oxides using this spectroscopy.   This \nis probably du e to the high level of complexity of the Mn 2 p spectra caused by the asymmetry \nof its signals, intricate multiplet splitting, and strong background. In this work, Angular Resolved \nX-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ARXPS) data from Mn 2 p and O 1 s of the ear ly oxidation \nstages are analyzed.  Metallic manganese deposits were carried out by sublimation on a clean \nsilicon wafer in UHV conditions (1.0\u00d710-7 Torr) and oxidized by a controlled flow of ultra -high \npurity oxygen for set times.   To reproduce the angular  dependence, it was necessary to extend \nthe oxidated layer model to include protrusions. The Mn 2 p metallic spectrum was fitted using \na double -Lorentzian asymmetric line -shape for the principal peak and Gaussian line shapes for \nthe multiplet satellites and  plasmons.The analysis of the oxidized samples was based on the \nBlock Approach  which allows for the subtraction of the metallic contributions of the spectrum, \nand, by consequence, the robust identification of the doublets associated to the oxide. Gaussian \nline shapes were employed for the peaks in the Mn 2 p spectra related to the ox ide. We found \nthat, for very low exposure to oxygen, about two monolayers of oxide grows in a fraction of the \nsurface, while the rest remains metallic.   As it could be expected, the depth of the protrusions \nincreases, and its surface coverage increase with  the oxidation level.   The oxide corresponds to \nMn+2. \nThis work was partially financed by  Proyecto Fronteras 58518, Conacyt, Mexico  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n348  \n \n[ SIT -316 ]  Insight into the physical origin of the Shirley \nbackground and the peak asymmetric through the analysis of \nthe 3d core level of the 5th -period elements  \nDulce Mar\u00ed a Guzm\u00e1n Bucio (dulce.guzman@cinvestav.mx) 1 , Jorge Abraham Carmona Carmona 1 , \nOrlando Cortazar Mart\u00ed nez 1 , Carlos Alberto Ospina Ocampo 1 , Vincent Crist 2 , Alberto Herrera \nG\u00f3mez 1  \n1 CINVESTAV -Unidad Quer\u00e9taro, Libramiento Norponiente #2000 Fraccionamiento Real de Juriquilla, \n76230, Quer\u00e9taro, Quer\u00e9taro, M\u00e9xico  \n2 XPS International LLC, 96 Ice House Landing, Marlborough, Massachusetts, 01752, USA  \nPeak -fitting of the 3 d core level from the 5th -period elements is challenging due to the high \nasymmetry of the main peak, the complex multiplet structur e including plasmon and satellite \npeaks, and the intense Shirley -type background. This work presents 3 d X-ray photoelectron \nspectra from pure elements ranging from Sr(Z=38) to Te(Z=52). These were analyzed using the \nDoubl\u00e9Lorentzian lineshape to account fo r the asymmetry of the main photoemission line, the \nbranching ratio was forced to the theoretically expected value from the Scofield tables. It was \npossible to quantify the modulation with Z of the asymmetry of the 3 d3/2 and 3 d5/2 main peaks. \nIt is remarka ble that, for elements with completely filled 4 d orbitals, the Double -Lorentzian \nasymmetry tends to be roughly equal between the two 3 d branches. The background was \nmodeled as a combination of a Shirley -type background, SVSC, a baseline, and, in some cases , a \nSlope background. The Shirley parameter decreases from a high value for Sr to a local minimum \nfor Mo, to a local maximum for Rh.

As metallic aluminum \nis highly reactive to oxygen, it is important to learn about how oxidation works in films and/or \ninterfaces when is applied in ultra -thin films. This can be done properly with X -ray photoelectron \nspectroscopy (XPS). The surface chemistry of materials is the point of interaction with the \nenvironment and with other materials. Its chemical composition influences how it interacts with \nits surroundings.  \nWe present the quantitative analysis for chemical assessment of the initial stages of alumin um \noxide thin films as well as its oxidation mechanism. The metallic films were obtained through \nsublimation employing a tungsten filament with a metallic aluminum pellet (99.999% pure Sigma \nAldrich).   The background pressure in the processing chamber was 1.5\u00d710-7 Torr and the \npressure during sublimation was 1.1\u00d710-6 Torr.   The film was characterized with an XPS \ninstrument employing a monochromatic x -ray aluminum source (XR5, from ThermoFisher) and \na 7-channeltron hemispherical spectrometer (Alpha110, from ThermoFisher) assembled by \nIntercovamex.  \nOxidation were done under an oxygen -controlled environment at different oxygen exposures (1 \nkL, 10 kL, 100 kL, 1 ML and 10 ML). Advanced techniques for fitting the Al 2 p and O 1 s spectra \nwere used, such as the block  method [1], the background active approach, the SVSC background \nand the simultaneous fitting method. The chemical composition and thickness calculation of the \naluminum oxide was done quantitatively from angle -resolved XPS data (ARXPS) analyzed under \nthe m ultilayer method (MLM).   We found that the oxidation kinetics is carried out by the \nformation of an Al3+ oxide layer with protrusions into the metallic substrate but with an Al2+ \ninterface layer.  \nThis work was partially financed by Proyecto Fronteras 58518 , Conacyt, Mexico.  \n[1] A.

Through FTIR, DRX, TGA and SEM it was observed \nthat the sample modified by ultrasound at a time of 60 min gave better results, showing a \nsignificant change and th e appearance of amino groups compared to the unmodified ZnO \nnanoparticles. The results of the adsorption test showed that the nanoparticles modified with \namino groups at 60 min achieved a removal percentage of 97% of the methylene blue dye, \nimproving this property, adjusting to a Langmuir isotherm. Therefore, zinc oxide nanoparticles \nhave a good potential for the removal of methylene blue in aqueous solution.  \nKeywords : zinc oxide; ultrasound; energy; adsorption.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  christian.cabello@ ciqa.edu.mx  \nReference:  Andrade -Guel, M., Cabello -Alvarado, C., Romero -Huitzil, R.

C.P. 04510, M\u00e9xico  \nVacuum arc  deposition systems have been widely used by the wear and protective coatings \nindustries, mainly because its high deposition rates which can greatly reduce productions costs \nin the long term. But vacuum arc deposition is also known to have a major drawback , the \nincorporation of non -vaporized material, known as macro -particles (MPs). Several approaches \nhave been taken to address this issue, such as: physical blocking, magnetic filtering or anodic \narcs, among others, all of which result in a decrease of the d eposition rate. In the late 1990s, \nBoxman [1,2] proposed a system with a refractory anode arc, to minimize the production of MPs. \nWe have previously reported [3] a novel concentrically oriented electrode configuration. This \ncombined the cathodic and the an odic modes of the electrical discharge, to maximize the \nextraction of ionized material to produce aluminum coatings with deposition rates up to 4 nm/s \nand surface roughness (Ra) as low as 25 nm. In the present work we will show the results of the \nlatest mo dification of the cathode, to be able to produce ternary compounds, such as Ti -Al-N or \nCr-Al-N. The produced films have been studied by profilometry to obtain deposition rates and \nroughness (Ra); XRD, SEM -EDS and XPS to verify structure and composition; sc ratch test,  pin-on-\ndisk and reciprocating tribometer to study, the adherences and  the wear resistance, \nrespectively; optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was performed to study the plasma and \ndetermine the presence of excited and ionized species.  \nKeywords : vacuum arc, plasma characterization, thin films, mechanical properties, tribology.  \nAuthor correspondence : camps@iim.unam.mx  \nReferences : [1] J.

By scanning \nelectron microscopy and contact profilometry, the thickness of the coatings was determined, on \naverage a 5.9 \u03bcm thickness was obtained. By X -ray diffraction (XRD) it was observed that the \nmaterial has a face -centered cubic crystalline structure. Furthermore, it was determined that the \nmaterial is composed of a solid s olution, where oxygen replaces nitrogen atoms in the crystalline \nstructure. Surface hardness was obtained using microindentation and nanoindentation, with \naverage values of 6.85 GPa and 21.7 GPa for steel and coating respectively. Adhesion tests, \nperformed  using the dynamic scratch method, showed critical adhesive loads higher than 17 N, \nwith failures related to chipping. Pin -on-disk wear tests were performed, finding coefficients of \nfriction between 4.5 and 5.5 for the TiAlON substrate and coating respecti vely. With scanning \nelectron microscopy, the wear mechanisms present for the TiAlON coating were observed, such \nas the formation of cracks and the accumulation of debris (debris), large areas of plowing and \nscratching were also found, which are characteris tics of the formation of hard particles.

One example is the variation of the wear (W) and frictio n force (Ff) produced in a reactive \nand no reactive atmosphere. This work presents the tribological changes made in a sliding -\ncontact system of a disk of 410 stainless steel and balls of 5100 steel with 1/8 inch diameter. The \n410 SS disks were obtained com mercially and polished to bring high -quality finish surfaces \n(mirror quality). These were cleaned with Extran\u00ae and distilled water, acetone and isopropyl \nalcohol in the ultrasonic bath for 10 min each. The discs' crystalline structure and surface \ntopograph y were measured using XRD and stylus profilometer, and the elemental composition \nwas determined using EDS. The tribological tests were carried out in a customized tribometer, \nand assembled in a vacuum system, in atmospheric pressure, 0.6 Pas and 266 Pa of Ar \natmosphere. The race tracks were analyzed using SEM, EDS, stylus profilometer and Raman \nspectroscopy. The Ff values produced in atmospheric pressure and 266 Pa of Ar were similar, \nwith Cof values of 0.49 \u00b1 0.21 and 0.56 \u00b1 0.04, respectively. While in a vacuum atmosphere, the \nFf value decreases to obtain a CoF of 0.27 \u00b1 0.04.

In view of \ntheir significance, the characterization of bulk and surface properties of biomaterials are \nfundamental for proper uses in the human body. In this work, we identify and characterize the \nsurface of commercially available 316L stainless steel rods used in previous studies on the \nsurface texturization by MeV ion irradiation [1]. Knowing the surface of the material can help in \ndetermining the role of its physical properties involved in the formation of nanostructures, and \nsuccessful applications in both industrial, and medical fields. The disk samples were prepared \nfrom 1 -cm diameter rod sliced with a 3mm thickness, and polished to mirror -like finished. To \ncharacterize the grain structure of the prepared samples, these were subjected to wet chemical \netching using Marbles\u2019s reactive solution (HCl, H2O and CuSO4) with respect to etch times. \nSubsequently, the surface mor phology and topography were studied with surface techniques \nincluding optical and electronic microscopes (SEM, and AFM). The bulk properties of 316L were \nalso studied with a Vicker\u2019s hardness tester. An increase of the surface roughness, with an \nenhanced v isualization of crystallographic phases of the processed substrates have been \nobtained. A comparison is made with other etching techniques that allow visualization and study \nof crystallographic phases.

In this indust ry, dry conditions are commonly required, so solid lubrication is a good \noption. It is reported that Mo can form oxides that reduce the friction coefficient of the coatings \n[1]. However, the deposition of multicomponent systems on steel leads to adhesion i ssues that \ncan prevent the potential application. In this work, we synthesized the Ti -Al-Mo-N system by \nreactive magnetron co -sputtering on steel D2, using two different bonding layers on the \nsubstrate prior to Ti -Al-Mo-N deposition to achieve good adhesio n and study the effect on their \nproperties.  Using a metallic bonding layer of Ti -Al-Mo, poor adhesion was reached in the system. \nSuch a situation leads to gross spallation at very low critical loads and poor protective character \nin corrosion because of th e detachment of coating once the solution reaches the substrate. Even \nthe mechanical properties were compromised, possibly because of the residual stresses that \nreach the interface with a weak bonding layer during the nanoindentation test. Once the Ti -Al-N \nbonding was used, enhanced adhesion was achieved where critical loads were found at higher \nvalues. The anti -corrosive character of the Ti -Al-Mo-N system was improved, showing a better \nperformance in the electrochemical test. These results could have a sig nificant impact on the \ndesign and optimization of more complex systems, suggesting other applications, for example, \nanti-corrosive coatings.  \nKey words : Ti-Al-Mo-N, hardness, corrosion, adhesion.  \nUriel Jir\u00f3n Lazos , uriel.jiron@cimav.edu.mx  \nThis work was supported by:  CONACYT Grant.  \nReference: Sergevnin, V.

One of the most widely used methods for depositing \nthis type of film is using the sputtering technique. A Ti -Al-N thin film was deposited using the \nmagnetron sputtering using Al target power of 80 W. The superficial roughnes s and the \nthicknesses obtained were 0.94 nm and 800 nm, respectively. Hardness and young\u00b4s modulus \nwere determined by instrumented nanoindentation, using a Berkovich diamond tip. The tests \nwere performed within the quasi -static range, consisting of a loadi ng time of 10 s, a dwell time \nof 3 s at maximum load, and an unload duration of 10 s. In addition, the samples were analyzed \nby scratch test, indicating the appearance of failure mechanisms at different critical loads Lc1 -4 \nin whole residual imprint. The F EM simulation of the scratch test was necessary for \nunderstanding and quantifying the maximum principal stress in -situ during the experimental \ndeformations. A comparative between the experimental and the simulated parameters as the \nnormal and tangential fo rce was required for ensuring that the stress -strain field produced is as \nclose to reality as possible. Finally, it should be noted that the feedback from the FEM results, \nallowed us to understand that the stress concentration in the back -tail region at th e border of \nthe scratch groove and the region ahead of the contact is in a tensile and compression \ndeformation, respectively, being a crucial behavior which is the responsible of the thin film \ndelamination.  \nKeywords : Nanoindentati\u00f3n, Mechanical properties,  Scratch test, Failure mechanisms, FEM.  \nJos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal P\u00e9rez Higareda,  jose.perez@cimav.edu.mx  \nThis work was supported by : CONACYT Grant  \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n358  \n \n[ SIT -263 ]  Developing a database for the assessment of the \ncomposition of multilayer nanofilms employing XPS or ARXPS \ndata  \nCarlos Alberto Ospina Ocampo (c_ao_o@yahoo.es) 1 , Orlando Cortazar Martinez 1 , Roberto Martinez \nGonzalez 1 , Alberto Herrera Gomez 1  \n1 Cinve stav unidad Quer\u00e9taro  \nThrough X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which is a highly surface sensitive technique, \nit is possible to determine the elemental composition and the structure (i.e., layers\u2019 thicknesses) \nof the top few nanometers ( 10 nm) of a  material\u2019s surface, even if it has a multilayer \narrangement. It has become synonymous of surface analysis, with many industries and \nacademic institutes regularly using XPS as a qualitative tool.  \nQuantitative XPS analysis relies on robust fitting analysis with the subsequent assessment of \nchemical compositions and structures. Although there is no consensus in the XPS community \non how to calculate surface composition from the peak intensities, there are highly accepted \npublications where physical parameters,  such as the effective attenuation length (EAL) and the \nphotoelectric cross -section, are employed instead of empirical sensitivity factors.  It is also too \ncommon the use of the maximum entropy method with algorithms that do not allow for the use \nof EALs c orresponding to each material of the multilayer film.   \n The MultiLayer Model MLM is a self -consistent analysis method for multilayer films.

The characterization of the multilayers \nshowed that the properties of the individual films are conserved in the multilayer system.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n361  \n \n[ SIT -303 ] The 4f photoemission spec tra of the sixth period \ntransition metals  \nAbraham Jorge Carmona -Carmona (carmona95@yahoo.com.mx) 1 , Orlando Cortazar -Martinez 2 , \nDulce -Maria Guzman -Bucio 2 , Carlos Alberto Ospina -Ocampo 2 , Vincent Crist 3 , Alberto Herrera -\nGomez 2  \n1 1Benem\u00e9rita Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla.

Assessing this dependence is a difficult task that requires state -of-the-art \nfitting methods because the spectra show complex asymmetry s hapes, multiplet structure, \nplasmons, and satellites; besides, in some cases, they overlap with Auger peaks.  Through the \nuse of the empirical double -Lorentzian lineshape, it was possible to very closely reproduce the \nasymmetry for all the elements, sugges ting that it could bear a fundamental basis. A \ncombination of Shirley -type (SVSC) and Tougard -type backgrounds was necessary to reproduce \nthe data.  The SVSC parameter decreases from a value of 0.0504 eV-1 for Hf  4f, with a local \nmaximum for Os (0.029 eV-1).

Due to its exceptional mec hanical and \nthermal characteristics, carbon nanotubes are of great interest in tribology. The use of \nnanotubes as a support for substances like metal nanoparticles is a novel application. Despite \nthe wide employment of water lubrication in numerous industr ial applications, more research \nis required to develop new, more efficient water nanofluids. In this work we report the synthesis \nof ceria nanoparticles supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes by a microwave method and \ntheir use as additives to prepare w ater-based nanofluids. The tribological performance of this \nnanofluid was investigated using a pin -on-disk tribometer on steel -steel contacts at a constant \nload (10N), sliding distance (3.6 m), entrainment speed (60mm/min), fluid temperature (300 K) \nand ad ditive concentrations (0.01, 0.05, 0.10% wt). The results show that the tribological \nbehavior of nanofluids can be improved by adding the appropriate additive at the optimal \nconcentration. Compared to pure water, ceria nanoparticles supported on carbon nan otubes \nshowed a good performance at 0.10% wt. The lowest friction coefficient (~0.10) was achieved \nwith this additive. The synthesized additive  were characterized by high -resolution transmission \nelectron microscopy (HR -TEM), Raman spectroscopy and X -ray di ffraction. In order to explain \nthe wear results, the worn surfaces were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy \n(SEM), Raman spectroscopy.  \n Keywords:  Carbon nanotubes, nanofluid, metal nanoparticles, water -based lubricants  \nCorresponding  author:  lararom@umich.mx   \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n363  \n \n[ SIT -134 ] TRIBOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR OF Nb -DOPED \nOXYNITRIDES FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE APPLICATIONS  \nCarlina Ortega -Portilla (iortega@posgrado.cidesi.edu.mx) 1 , Guillermo C\u00e9sar Mondrag\u00f3n Rodriguez 1 \n, Juan Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Carmona (juan.gonzalez@cidesi.edu.mx) 1  \n1 CONACYT Centro de Ingenier\u00ed a y Desarrollo Industrial, Quer\u00e9taro, Qro, M\u00e9xico.  \nTitanium aluminum oxynitrides (TiAlON) and titanium aluminum oxynitrides doped with \nniobium (TiAlNbON) Coatings were deposited on AISI D2 stee l substrates by the reactive \ncathodic arc technique. Structural characterization was performed by X -ray diffraction (XRD), \nfinding for TiAlON crystallographic orientations similar to those of titanium aluminum nitride \n(TiAlN) and for TiAlNbON the separatio n of the titanium aluminum oxide phase (Al2TiO5), which \nmakes it a polycrystalline and polyphase coating.

A nanohardness of 12.85 \u00b1 2.85 GPa was obtained for the coatings, with an \nincrease in the modulus of elasticity and the resistance to plastic deformation for TiAlNbON . \nThis led to an increase in adhesion for the Nb -doped coating of up to 80%.

In particular, SiO2 nanoparticles have been used in many industrial applications to improve \nthe fundamental properties of complex systems.  For instan ce, in the enhanced recovery in oil wells, or \nto improve the elasticity of interfacial layer and to increase the stability of foams prepared with \nsurfactant mixtures.  Also, these nanoparticles have been used in biomedical applications, to encapsulate \ndrug s and improve their transport in the cellular environment. Due to its wide applications, it is \nimportant to study the molecular interaction between nanoparticles and different molecular species such \nas surfactants or polymeric materials to observe the vari ations in the physical properties of the systems. \nAt an experimental level, different techniques have allowed to determine the modification of these hybrid \nsystems and obtain their resulting morphology. The use of molecular simulation techniques to \nunderst and the nature of the interactions in these systems at the microscopic level is an essential \ncomplement to experimental advances. In the present work, the molecular interactions between \nspherical SiO2 nanoparticles with stearic acid and bisphenol A were st udied using molecular dynamics \n(MD) simulations to study the different molecular interaction present between these species in a solvent. \nNanoparticles, stearic acid, bisphenol A and solvent molecules were described with the CHARMM36 and \nTIP3P force fields,  respectively used to estimate the forces between atoms within molecules and between \nmolecules. All the MD simulations were developed with a duration of 100 ns using the NVT type assembly \nand the GROMACS -2019.2 software. The evaluation of the molecular int eractions was carried out through \nthe study of the radial distribution function (RDF) and the calculation of the interaction energy between \nthe characteristic groups of the involved species. These simulations allowed us to determine the surface \ninteraction  mechanism of this type of spherical cristobalite nanoparticles with the selected organic \nmolecules.  \n \nKeywords:    Nanoparticles, Molecular Interactions, Molecular Dynamics Simulations  \nReferences : I.

These \ntheoretical models support the design of experiments in the search for better materials with desired and \noptimized properties  as a guide to improvement. In this work, the heterogeneous elastic micropolar \nproblem subject to imperfect contact conditions is addressed by the two -scale asymptotic \nhomogenization (AHM) method. The imperfect interface is described as a generalization of  the interface \nspring model reported for linear elasticity, that is, the imperfect interface is assumed by the following \nconditions: the coupled tractions and stresses are continuous, but the displacements and microrotations \nare discontinuous along the imp erfect interface. The jumps of displacements and microrotations are \nconsidered proportional to the interface traction and coupled stress components, respectively. In \nparticular, the effective stiffness and torque properties for micropolar bi -laminated nano composites with \ncentro -symmetric isotropic components and imperfect contact conditions are determined by AHM. \nNumerical results are shown and discussed. The effects of the imperfection parameters and the cell \nlength in the y 3-direction on the effective pro perties are studied. All effective stiffness and torque \nproperties are susceptible to the imperfection effects and the cell length provokes changes in the effective \nproperties behavior when an imperfect interface is assumed.  \n \nKeywords:  micropolar media, asymptotic homogenization method, centro -symmetric materials, \nCosserat laminated nanocomposites, imperfect interface  \nAuthor for correspondence:  yoanhealmeyda1209@gmail.com  \nAcknowledgments : YEA gratefully acknowledges the financial suppor t of Grant A1 -S-37066 during the \npostdoctoral stay at IIT, UACJ.

The modeling \nconsiders the experimental evidence of the cubic BP(111) epitaxial growth on an AlN(0001) substrate. \nIn this way studies invoke the hexagonal nitrogen terminated AlN (0001) - surface. The first boron (B) \nlayer is deposited on top of the structure following th e hexagonal arrangement. After that, phosphorus \n(P) atoms are accommodated accounting for the hexagonal sequence. This facilitates the subsequent P -B \nbilayer formation, which in turn allows the formation on top of the structure the P -B bilayer in two \ndiffe rent high symmetry sites: one on the T4 and the other on the H3. Energetics indicate that the H3 \nconfiguration is the one with the lowest total energy 0.125 eV smaller than the T4 geometry. This result \nyields the conclusion that the BP (111) epitaxial laye r is formed in the cubic phase as experiment dictates. \nStudies include calculations of the density of states (DOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) to show \nthe surface metallic behavior.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n372  \n \n[ TSM -5 ] First -principles approach to study the electronic and \nmagnetic properties in ferromagnetic RNi2 Laves phases (R = Ho, Er)  \nTom\u00e1s L\u00f3pez -Solenzal (tlopez.solenzal@gmail.com) 1 , Jos\u00e9 Luis Enr\u00ed quez -Carrejo 1 , Manuel Antonio \nRamos -Murillo 1 , Yoanh Espinosa -Almeyda (yoanh.espinosa@uacj.mx) 1 , C\u00e9sar Fidel S\u00e1nchez -Vald\u00e9s 1  \n1 Departamento de F\u00ed sica y Matem\u00e1ticas, Instituto de Ingenier\u00ed a y Tecnolog\u00ed a, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de \nCiudad Ju\u00e1rez, 32310 Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, M\u00e9xico  \nIn this work, the mag netic orderings in RNi 2 Laves phases (R = Ho, Er) were simulated by the density \nfunctional theory (DFT) as is programed in CASTEP package.

But at the same time, \nthe properties of the materials used for its manufacture are reaching their limits, being the \nabsorber materials the most important component, so it is in search of new absorbers that come \nfrom a bundant sources and at the same time are economical. Several binary compounds such \nas SnS, PbS, and Bi 2S3 implemented in photovoltaic devices have provided acceptable results; \nhowever, some of their characteristics as binary compounds, such as their bandga p energy or \ntheir layered structure, make them limited, trying to maximize these properties PbS -Bi2S3 \ncombinations have been worked for the formation of ternary compounds, with the same \nintention, but trying to change the lead, it is proposed to know the o ptical properties of an SnS -\nBi2S3 configuration as a ternary compound and determine whether it has suitable characteristics \nfor its application in photovoltaic devices.  \nIn this work, we present Ab -initio calculations of the electronic band structure, densi ty of states, \nand optical properties for different configurations of SnS -Bi2S3. We use Density Functional \nTheory (DFT) approach by using the ultrasoft pseudopotential approximation for the electron -\nion interaction and a plane wave basis set for the wave fu nctions with the PWscf code Quantum \nEspresso. Optimization calculations of lattice parameters and atomic positions were carried out, \nfor the configurations used plane -wave cutoff energy of 680 eV was used. In addition, the \ncalculations were performed consi dering the spin -orbit coupling (SOC) for which the use of fully \nrelativistic pseudopotentials is required, being for all cases, Perdew -Burke -Ernzerhof (PBE).

Among some of their \nprincipal characteristics and which makes it possible for these materials to be considered as a \nsolid option for the application in optoelectronics devices is a direct band gap energy that covers \nfrom the near infrared (1.7 \u00b5m) up to the mid infrared (3.5 \u00b5m) at room temperature. An \nimportant member of this family is In xGa 1-xAsySb1-y quaternary alloy. Besides sharing some of \nthe main characteristics of the antimonide family, this compound allows to tail or its band gap in \naccordance with the content of the precursor elements that conform it. In order to being able \nto visualize some of the main characteristics of this material, having in consideration the multiple \npossible contents of the In xGa 1-xAsySb1-y, moving from x= 0 and y= 0 for GaSb to x= 1 and y= 1 or \nInSb, a simulation was developed using MATLAB computational software, which is mainly based \non the results of different chemical, structural and optical characterizations performed on \nInxGa 1-xAsySb1-y quaternary alloys grown by liquid phase epitaxy.

Among \nTMNs, chromium nitride (CrN) has been investigated recently due to its interesting structural \nand magnetic properties, that makes it ideal for data storage and memory devices, i.e. , \nspintronic applications. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that surface properties \ncan be different from those of bulk. In addition, these properties depend on the thickness, \norientation, strain, and defects at the surface. Therefore, it is imp ortant to study the physical \nproperties of different CrN surfaces for practical applications, such as in spintronic. Taking into \naccount the above mentioned, we perform spin -polarized first -principles calculations to study \nthe electronic and magnetic prope rties of the CrN (111) surface considering different surface \nterminations. We evaluate their thermodynamic stability employing the surface formation \nenergy formalism. According to the calculations, the N -terminated and Cr -terminated surfaces \nare stable und er N -rich and Cr -rich environments, respectively. At intermediate conditions the \noctopolar, and the \u03b1-(2\u00d72) -Cr reconstructions are stable. The ideal surfaces show metallic \ncharacteristics. In contrast, the reconstructions show half metallic behavior, as induced by the \nCr vacancies in the structure. In the N -terminated and reconstructed surfaces the spin density \ndistributions exhibit a ferromagnetic alignment in the first bilayer, and an antiferromagnetic \nordering in the inner bilayers. On the  other hand, the Cr -terminated surface shows a C -type \nantiferromagnetic behavior. In addition, a magnetic alignment switch from C -type \nantiferromagnetic to A -type antiferromagnetic is obtained when a tensile strain is applied to the \nsurface.

M\u00e9xico  \n \nMagnetic materials have been an important subject for academic studies and application \ndevice s, to which low dimensionalities give new physical significance due to the strong quantum \nconfinement effects. In particular, two -dimensional magnetic materials have attracted \nenormous attention since it has been revealed that it is possible to obtain 2D s tructures from \nVan der Waals crystals; this opens a huge potential to create numerous and novel devices with \n2D materials. Therefore, the development of theoretical and experimental studies in this type \nof structures is essential to take advantage of the p roperties that can be obtained from them. \nThe purpose of this work is to calculate and analyze the behavior of electronic and magnetic \nproperties in a set of silicene and germanene structures in which the effect of doping and \nvacancy generation is explored . In general, a set of silicene and germanene sheets with \nvacancies were modeled and doped with Si, Ge, P and C. Using the Quantum Espresso code \n(based on the density functional theory) the optimization (through a spin polarized calculation) \nof the unit ce ll of each film was performed; exchange and correlation energy was approximated \nby a Perdew Burke Ernzerhof ultra -soft generalized gradient pseudopotential (GGA -PBE). \nSubsequently, the density of states and total magnetization were calculated for each shee t. The \nresults show that the graphene sheet with vacancies presents a magnetic moment. A variation \nin the bandgap energy in the sheets is also observed, due to the effect of the vacancies and the \ndoping with the different elements. It can be concluded that  this type of materials has potential \napplications in different fields such as electronics and optoelectronics.  \n \nKeywords:  Silicene, Germanene, Magnetic Properties, Electronic Properties, Electronic \nProperties.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  Ariadna S\u00e1nchez -Castillo / ariadna_sanchez@uaeh.edu.mx  \nThis work was supported by: LANCAD -25360  \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n383  \n \n[ TSM -62 ] THEORETICAL STUDY OF THE ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES OF APbI3 \nPEROVSKITE -TYPE MATERIALS (A = Cs+, CH3NH3+ and HC(NH2)2+)  \nJos\u00e9 Juan Jhonatan Diaz Lop\u00e9z (jose.diaz@cinvestav.mx) 3 , Iv\u00e1n de Jes\u00fas Ornelas Cruz \n(iornelas.ipn@gmail.com) 3 , Salvador Gallardo Hern\u00e1nd ez 1 , Iouri Koudriavtsev 4 , Svetlana \nMansurova 2  \n1 Departamento de Fisica,Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico \nNacional, CINVESTAV, Av.

In this \ncontext, first principles studies have acquire d a leading role in studying the physical and \nchemical phenomena of these materials that give rise to their attributes (  high mobility  of holes \nand electrons, highly modifiable chemical composition, etc.) and to its deficiencies \n(instability  and reactivity  with external agents, etc. ). However, the accuracy of the theoretical \ndescription remains in question. For this reason, in this work the perovskites CsPbI 3, \nCH 3NH 3PbI 3 and HC(NH 2)2PbI 3 were studied based on the Density Functional Theory as \nimplemented in the DMol3 computational code. Making a comparison between two different \nbases, whose only difference between the two is the addition of p orbitals for the hydrogen \natoms, it was concluded that the relative errors obtained are comparable to e ach other and that \na good structural description can be generated with both bases. For the study of the electronic \nproperties, the meta -GGA functionals were used: TPSS and revTPSS; as well as the functional \nHCTH/407 for comparison, since the latter is one of the most precise functional within GGA [1]. \nAlthough the first functional is closer to the experimental value of the gap -forbidden energy \n(BPE), none can describe the ultraviolet shift of the BPE that is obtained in these materials by \ndecreasing the vol ume of the cation in the A site. It is hoped that the results presented here will \nhelp to improve the description of this type of compounds.  \n \nKeywords : Perovskite, Density Functional Theory, meta -GGA, forbidden energy gap.  \nOne reference:  [1] Medvedev, M.

Acc ording to the \ncalculations, five MXenes are stable, where the most stable 50% Ta/Ti ratio structure (Ti 2Ta2C3) \npresents a chemically ordered composition. The Li intercalation process for Ti 4C3 and Ti 2Ta2C3 \nMxenes is carried out as adatoms on the surface, w ith the T4 site being the most favorable. The \nchemically ordered MXenes provide better OCV values and can store more Li atoms than the \nTi4C3 Mxene. Also, the Li di fusion process demonstrates that Ti 2Ta2C3 is a more \u00e9 ficient material \nto be employed as an anode in batteries since it provides the lowest energy barriers.

In this work, we \nfocus on the nano porous SiC, specifically on the effects of the surface pore and the type of \npassivation on the  mechanical properties of porous silicon carbide, this through the density \nfunctional theory and the supercell scheme. To build the model, first we grow up a 3C -SiC in the \n[1 1 0] direction, then a column of atoms was removed on the [0 0 1] direction to cr eate four \nkinds of surfaces, two with a silicon -full and carbon -full surface and other two with a silicon -rich \nand a carbon -rich surface, the dangling bonds were passivated with hydrogen (H). After \noptimization, some atoms of H from the nanopores were repl aced for atoms of fluorine and \nchlorine to simulate a mixed passivation. The results show that properties as the young\u2019s \nmodulus have been affected by the type of pore and the passivation, for example the carbon -\nfull pore with a H + F passivation have the lowest young\u2019s modulus. Additionally, the Bulk \nmodulus was calculated, this could be used for energy storage applications.  \n \nThis work was supported by  CONACyT and  IPN through the SIP proyect 20220587.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n390  \n \n[ TSM -108 ]  Modeling the nickel and cobalt deposit on the AlN \n(111) -(2\u00ed\u20142) surface: A DFT study  \nA.C.

Calculations  have been done \nwithin  the spin polarized periodic density functional theory as deve loped  in the VASP  code.  The \nexchange \u2013correlation energies are treated within the generalized gradient approximation \n(GGA). The electron -ion interaction is treated by using pseudopotentials. To perform an \nadequate description of the transition metals magnet ic properties, we have considered the \nHubbard correction (GGA + U) to treat the highly correlated electrons in the d -orbitals.  This work \nexplores  the adsorption, incorporation, and substitution of the magnetic metals (Ni and Co), \nconsidering  different cove rage, namely:  \u00bc, \u00bd, \u00be,  and 1 monolayer (ML).  Furthermore, three \nmagnetic alignments (non -magnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic) were taken into \naccount. According to the results, Ni atoms needed no Hubbard correction. In contrast, Co atoms \nused a H ubbard correction  (U=1 eV) to reproduce experimental values such as the lattice \nparameters, magnetic moment and cohesive energy. We employed the surface formation \nenergy formalism to determine the thermodynamic stability of the different surfaces.   In both  \ncases, the substitutions of Ni and Co atoms are the most stable structures. Nevertheless, Co \nstructures present a higher magnetic behavior than Ni structures. For both metals, the total \ndensity of states (DOS) and projected DOS (PDOS) show that the upperm ost bilayer (BL) of the \nsurfaces is metallic and the lower BLs are semiconductors. The valence and conduction bands \nare mainly formed by the N -p and Al -p orbitals, respectively. Finally, in this work AlN (111) \nsurfaces doped with Ni and/or Co have been pro posed to develop diluted magnetic \nsemiconductors (DMS) for applications in spintronics.   \n \nKeywords:  Surface structure, Magnetic materials, DFT  \nReference:    \nA.C.

Knowing and comparing \nthe mechanical properties between carbon nanostructures, such as the stretching bond force \nconstant ( Kr), contributes  to its early technological implementation as specific nanosensors. Kr \nvalue in the chemical bonds allow us to quantify the opposition to the change of the charge \ndistribution between the atoms, when these are subjected to a bond length changes. In other \nwords, Kr values describe the stiffness of the chemical bond when the bonds are under stress \nstrain. In this study, Kr values calculated with Density Functional Theory for different carbon \nnanostructures are analysed. The results suggest a range of allowabl e Kr values for carbon \nnanomaterials, delimited by the 3D and 1D structures.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n393  \n \n[ TSM -55 ] Theoretical studies on the monolithic integration of \nGaAs on (111), (110) and (100) Silicon surfaces  \nJavier Alanis (javier.alanis.perez@hotmail.com) 1 , Reyna Reyna M\u00e9ndez -Camacho 2 , Esteban Cruz -\nHern\u00e1ndez 1  \n1 Coordinaci\u00f3n  para la Innovaci\u00f3n y la Aplicaci\u00f3n de la Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00ed a, CIACYT -UASLP, Sierra \nLeona 550, S.

From this perspective, the grow of \nhigh -quality  GaAs semiconductors films on Si is very imperative [1]. However, the thermal \nexpansion coefficient difference and large lattice mismatch between GaAs and Si make it \nchallenging to obtain high quality GaAs thin films. Experimentally, it was found that the \nmorphologies and internal crystal structure quality of GaAs films grown on Si(111) was better \nthan those grown on Si(001) [2]. Also experimentally, was found a large density of crystal defects \nfor the case of GaAs films growth on Si(110), even for small fi lm thickness as 8 monolayers [3]. \nTherefore, we can infer that the direction of growth impact directly in the epitaxial quality growth \nof GaAs on Si substrates, classifying Si(111), Si(001) and Si(110) from best to worst for the \nmonolithic growth of GaAs f ilms.  In this work, we present an ab initio study of the possible origin \nof the internal crystal quality differences in the growth of GaAs on Si(111), Si(001) and Si(110). \nThe structural changes, energy density differences and interfacial energy were calcu lated by \nusing density functional theory. Our preliminary calculations show that dissipation of the stress \nenergy through the relaxation of the distortion of the GaAs lattice is fundamental to obtain the \nbest epitaxial integration of GaAs on Si substrates.  \nKeywords:  DFT, MBE, Epitaxy  \nThis work was supported by:  CONACyT M\u00e9xico \u2013 Estancias postdoctorales por M\u00e9xico 2021 of \nJ.

These facts make the 2D materials good candidates for new \nnanoelectronics devices, specially, in the post -silicon era, where new alternatives have been \ninvoked to replace the silicon in electronic devices. Monolayers based on silicon, germanium \nand carbon have been explored as potential materials to build electronic devices, unfortunately, \nthe absence of an intrinsic band gap is not a desirable property for electronic applicati ons. On \nthe other hand, the blue phosphorene displays an indirect band gap of 2 eV, which make it \nsuitable for its applications in electronic devices [1]. For this reason, the transport properties of \nblue phosphorene nanoribbons (BPNR) with hydrogen satura ted edges in the presence of \npollutant molecules are investigated. Studies are done using the density functional theory (DFT) \nand the non -equilibrium Green\u00b4s Function (NEGF) approach. Ozone (O 3), sulfur trioxide (SO 3) \nand acetylene (C 2H2) molecules are ads orbed on the NR to induce current modifications as a \nfunction of the applied bias voltage. Results of the current ratio and sensitivity of the BPNR help \nvisualizing the change in the current when the molecules interact with the BPNR, showing that \nthe three  molecules induce increase/decrease of the I -V curves, for positive/negative bias \nvoltage, and how sensible the I -V curve of the BPNR is in the presence of pollutant molecules. \nThe local density of states (LDOS) shows impurity levels in the band gap of the  pristine BPNR as \ninduced by the interaction with O 3 and C 2H2 molecules. Moreover, when the C 2H2 molecule \ninteracts with the BPNR, the current as a function of the bias voltage increases significantly. In \ncontrast, electronic and transport properties resul ts when the SO 3 is adsorbed seem quite \nsimilar to those of the pristine BPNR.  \n \nKeywords:  Blue phosphorene nanoribbons, DFT, Non -equilibrium Green\u00b4s function, Transport \nproperties.  \nAuthor for correspondence:  cacorona@ifuap.buap.mx  \n[1] F.

Structurally we \ncan find TiO 2 in three different crystalline phases: Anatase, Rutile, and Brookit e. Both Anatase \nand rutile phase have been reported efficient for photocatalytic processes (dye degradation), \nwhile the brookite phase has been used for CO 2 photoreduction. Obtaining thin films of TiO 2 has \nbeen reported by different methods such as the Spu ttering technique, which, allows us to \nmodify the structural properties by changing the deposit conditions as the working pressure \nsince this condition defines the energy with the involved particles collide with the substrate. In \nthis work, the deposition of thin films of TiO 2 is presented by the sputtering method varying the \nworking pressure. Different phases of TiO 2 (anatase, rutile, and brookite) were obtained \ndepending on the working pressure used. The contribution of these phases changes the \nphysicoche mical properties of TiO 2, which influence the photocatalytic reduction of heavy \nmetals present in water.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n397  \n \n[ THF -71 ] (Fe2O3)x(ZnO)1 -x Thick Films obtained by Ultrasonic \nSpray Pyrolysis  \nCarlos Torres -Fraustro (cafrator@gmail.com) 1 , Martin Zapata -Torres 1 , Nadia Cruz -Gonzalez 1 , \nSergio Tomas 2 , Miguel Melendez -lIra (miguel.melendez@cinvestav.mx) 2  \n1 Cicata -Legaria, IPN, CDMX, Mexico  \n2 Departamento de Fisica, Cinvestav -IPN, CDMX, Mexico  \n (Fe 2O3)x(ZnO) 1-x composite thick films were prepared by Ultrasonic Spray Pyrolysis on a glass \nsubstrate. at 450\u00b0C. using 0.1 M aqueous solutions of FeCl 3 6H 2O and ZnCl 2 anhydride \ncompounds.

This work presents \nthe methodology to achieve air -annealing  selenization of silver antimony sulfide (AgSbS 2) \nfilms  deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD) on stainless steel \nsubstrates.  Selenium  incor poration was carried out  by heating 100 mg of  selenium  powder (Se, \nSigma -Aldrich, 100 mesh ) at 400 \u00baC.   The optimal distance of AgSbS 2 films from the selenium \nsource was kept at 5 cm to produce homogeneous selenization without elemental Se traces.

Usually, in sputtering, direct current (DC) or radio frequency (RF) \nsources are used to generate the ions. However, not all metal oxide materials can be sputtered \nefficiently using these power sources. Therefore, i n recent years, pulsed direct current (DC pulse) \nsources have been chosen to increase the ion ratio compared to DC and RF sputtering. So, it is \nof importance to analyze the deposition of titanium oxide thin films by DC pulse sputtering to \nobserve the relat ionship of on pulse width (ton), off pulse width (toff), and cycle time (tc) with \nion formation.  \nIn this work, we present an analysis of the influence of pressure (Pt), average current (Im), ton, \ntoff, and tc on the formation of titanium, oxygen, and argon  ions during the process of thin -film \ndeposition by DC pulse sputtering. For this purpose, the emission spectrum (OES) and the \naverage voltage (Vm) have been taken as state variables. The study is carried out for three \npressures (5.0 10 and 15 mTorr), four  pulse frequencies (75, 100, 125 and 150 kHz) and four \naverage currents (0.20, 0.25, 0.30 and 0.35 mA). These parameters are considered input \nvariables of the system. Multivariate analysis shows that, in the ultraviolet range, in the 398.18, \n399.86, and 39 9.98 nm lines, titanium ion emission can be observed as a function of the input \nvariables. Under maximum titanium ion emission conditions, oxygen flux sweeps were \nperformed using linear step functions. With positive slopes, it was passed from the metallic \nmode to the reactive mode and negative slopes from the reactive mode to the metallic mode. \nWith these sweeps, it is observed that the poisoning of the target can be analyzed through the \nlines 777.19 and 777.42 nm, which present a relationship of the oxygen  ion emission with the \nreactive gas flux in both the metal deposition mode and the reactive mode the instantaneous \nvoltage profile and the instantaneous current profile present relevant information of the bench \npoisoning process. This study aims to find th e parameters that most influence the properties of \nthin films prepared by DC pulse sputtering.       \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n400  \n \n[ THF -239 ]  Characterization and analysis of CsPbBr3 thin films \nby thermal evaporation  \nR.G Sotelo Marquina (rubigsotelo@gmail.com) 3 , Marisol Hernandez 1 , J.

However, the application of methods for large \nscale film production has not yet been extensively studied. Thi s paper describes the facile \ndeposition of VO2  (M) particles on the silica glass substrate to evaluate their thermochromic \neffect. For this, its dispersion in 2 different aqueous media such as 2 -propanol and ethylene \nglycol was evaluated. The results show an average particles size of 100nm with 2 -propanol and \n110nm. Subsequently this dispersion was sprayed on glass substrate for its characterization by \nX-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron \nmicroscope (SEM , Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Atomic force microscopy (AFM), and \nCary 5000 UV -VIS-NIR Spectrophotometer.

The thin films where fabricated by a process that can \nbe broken down in two parts. First, we grow thin films by a process of metal organic chemical \nvapor deposition (MOCVD) employing metal organic precursors of Sm and Fe. Second, we did a \ndiffusion process of Fluor and Arsenic towards the thin films utilizing a pellet made of \nSmFeAsO 0.4F0.2. This last process is made by a thermic treatment at various temperature plateau \nand different times for each one. We do this and with the help of EDS spectroscopy we obtain \nthe chemical  stoichiometry  of each thin film and with X -ray diffrac tion we evaluate the different \ncrystalline phase formations for the different conditions in the diffusion process. We notice that \nthere are mayor differences in the phase formation of crystallites if the deposition is made on \nLaAlO 3 or on CaF 2; giving plac e to different superconducting properties. By utilizing a scanning \nelectron microscope (SEM) we can observe the morphology of the films and with the resistances \nvs temperature measurements (RT) we can see the superconducting properties.

In recent years, compounds such as Sb 2(S,Se) 3 have emerged as an \nimportan t alternative for efficient energy conversion in the future, since they have favorable \ncharacteristics such as being made of abundant and non -toxic elements, band gap tunable \nbetween 1.1 and 1.7 eV, p -type conductivity and a high absorption coefficient (10 5 cm -1). \nCurrently, the efficiency record in antimony chalcogenides corresponds to an \nFTO/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3/spiro -OMeTAD/Au structure with 10.7% efficiency, reported last year. In this \nwork, we present a study to obtain the compound Sb2(S,Se)3 synthesized by means of an \ninnovative technique, which consists of the evaporation of elemental Sb, followed by thermal \ntreatment at different temperatures in an atmosphere of sulfur and selenium generated at from \npure powders. The films were analyzed by X -Ray Diffractio n (XRD) and Scanning Electron \nMicroscopy (SEM) for structural and morphological studies, and EDS for a compositional study. \nTheir reflectances were also analyzed to determine the band -gap values. The results were \ndiscussed regarding the feasibility of the method with which they were determined as an \nalternative technique to the traditional methods used so far and for the subsequent use of these \nthin films in the process of high -quality and low -cost solar cells.  \nKeywords:  Sb2(S,Se)3 thin films, solar cells, thermal evaporation, thermal treatment.  \n Corresponding author:  mirinic92@gmail.com  \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n405  \n \n[ THF -159 ]  Effect of growth temperature and hydrogen flow in \nthe composition and photoluminescence properties of SiCxOy \nfilms deposited by HFCVD Technique  \nAntonio Coyopol (acoyopol@gmail.com) 2 , M.

The carbon and silicon \noxide compounds in gas phase were generated from ethanol vapor and the chemical reaction \nof atomic hydrogen (H\u00b0) with a solid fused quartz sour ce. The SiC xOy films were deposited on N -\ntype crystalline silicon (100) substrates with resistivity of 1 to 20 ohm -cm. The substrate \ntemperature was modified between 1000 to 800\u00b0 C with a fixed H2 flow (62.4 sccm), and with a \nfixed substrate temperature (1 000\u00b0 C) and varying the H2 flow from 62.4 to 187 sccm. As a \nresults from SIMS measurements; carbon concentration decrease for both group from 11 to 5 \nat.%. The Fourier transform infra -red spectroscopy measurements shown that an increase in \ncarbon content f avors the formation of both: Si -C bonds located at about 816 cm-1 and Si -O-Si \nvibrations located at around 1050 -1070 cm-1, the last absorption peak is associates to a SiOx \nnetwork.   From the photoluminescence measurements the samples shown an intense PL \nresponse, associated to Si -related oxygen vacancies (Si -NOVs) and Si -related oxygen deficiency \ncenters (Si -ODCs) due to low carbon concentration into the SiC xOy films. As a conclusion we \nargue that the intense response of PL of the SiC xOy films can be associ ated to the nature of the \nradiative defects as a results of the experimental growth conditions of the samples which could \nbe associated to the growth kinetic of films.       \nKeywords:  SiCxOy films, HFCVD, PL, SIMS, FTIR.  \ncorresponding author:  acoyopol@gmai l.com  \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n406  \n \n[ THF -377 ] Effect of the cap layer thickness on AlGaAs/GaAs \nheterostructures for optoelectronic devices  \nL.

In \nthis work, the effect of surface states (Nss) on the bui lt-in electric field and charge distribution \nin n-i-p GaAs -based heterostructure is investigated by the implementation of a Front Surface \nField layer (FSF) placed at different distance from surface by the capping layer thickness (CLT). \nWe grew samples by m olecular beam epitaxy with 40 nm FSF of (a) GaAs and (b) AlGaAs both n -\ntype doped with 5x1018 cm-3 positioned at 80 nm from surface by the GaAs n -type doped with \n5x1018 cm-3 caping layer. H 2O2/HCl/H 2O wet etching was employed to vary the CLT from the \netchi ng time. Thus, samples with capping layer of 80, 60, 40 and 20 nm were obtained with the \naim to determine the best distance to optimize the effect of the FSF. We determined the \ndepletion region and their modification with the passivation by Raman spectrosc opy by the L - \nand LO integrated intensity, obtaining a reduction with the CLT. Franz -Keldish oscillations (FKO) \nin photoreflectance spectrum were employed to evaluate the built -in electric field. We found \nthat the total built -in electric field changes arou nd (a) 10% and (b) 4% with the wet etching. The \ncurrent -voltage behavior under AM1.5 illumination at 550 W/m2 indicates an improvement when \nthe surface effect is controlled.  \nKeywords: optoelectronic devices, surface, photoreflectance, thin films .   \nAuthor for correspondence:  irving.cortes@uaslp.mx  \n[1] https://doi.org/10.1116/1.4942898  \nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of FRC -UASLP, COPOCyT, and CONACYT -Mexico \nthrough grants: INFR -2015 -01-255489, CB 2015 - 257358, PNCPN2014 -01-248071, Fidei comiso \n23871, and Investigadoras e Investigadores por Mexico (Project No. 44).  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n407  \n \n[ THF -204 ] Effect of thermal annealing on the structural and optical \nproperties of SiCxOy films obtained by HFCVD technique  \nJuan Carlos P \u00e9rez Trinidad (juan.perezt@alumno.bua p.mx) 1 , Antonio Coyopol Sol \u00eds \n(antonio.coyopol@correo.buap.mx) 1 , Imelda Antonia Pedraza Chan 1 , Godofredo Garc \u00eda Salgado 1 , \nMarco Antonio V \u00e1squez Agust \u00edn 2 , Rom \u00e1n Romano Trujillo 1 , Enrique Rosendo Andr \u00e9s 1 , Cris \u00f3foro \nMorales Ruiz 1 , Reina Galeazzi Isasmendi 1  \n1 Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  en Dispositivos Semiconductores (CIDS), Benem \u00e9rita Universidad Aut \u00f3noma \nde Puebla, 14 Sur y Av.

The SiC xOy films were deposited on n -\ntype silicon substrates (100) with resistivity \u03c1 = 1-10 \u03a9 cm-1 by using Hot Filament Chemical Vapor \nDeposition (HFCVD) technique. For SiC xOy films growth a solid source quartz SiO(s) and liquid \nethanol C 2H5OH bu bbled by molecular hydrogen was used. The samples were deposited  at \nsubstrate temperature of 800 \u00b0C using 15.6 sccm of H 2 flow. After  the deposition the  samples \nwere annealed  by rapid thermal annealing  in the temperature range  of 300  -900 \u00b0C. The films \nwere characterized by Photoluminescence (PL), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) \nand X -Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The FTIR results of as -deposited films showed \nthree major peaks: Si \u2013O\u2013Si around 450, 845 and 1080 cm-1 attributed to Si \u2013O\u2013Si rocking mode, \nSi\u2013C stretching mode, and Si \u2013O\u2013Si antisymmetric stretching mode, respectively.

The \nPL spectrum of the as -deposited films displayed a broad band centered at approximately 418 \nnm. For SiC xOy films annealed under N 2 and H 2 atmospheres, the stretching mode associated to \nSi\u2013O\u2013Si band increased as the anneal ing temperature increased. The PL intensity of green and \nred band increases as the annealing temperature increased. For the samples annealed under a \nO2 atmosphere. The intensity of the Si \u2013O\u2013Si bond stretching mode slightly increased as the \nannealing temper ature was increased.

This phase transition temperature is close to 67oC.

However, for a good thermochromic window, the abi lity to modulate solar energy \nis needed in both the region's IR as well as in the visible region. Currently, for the improving the \nproperties of VO 2 to be used as a thermochromic window, it has been doped with elements such \nas W, Mo, Nb. in the present wor k, VO 2 has been doped with different concentrations of TiO 2 \nand characterized for its structural, optical, electrical, and morphological properties using \ndifferent optoelectronic techniques.

CuSbS 2 \nhas direct band gap in the range of 1.38 -1.56 eV and high absorption coefficient of 10-4 cm-1, \nwhich are optimal for absorber layers in solar cells. In the present work, CuSbS 2 thin films were \ndeveloped by pulse electrodeposition technique on FTO glass substrates from a single bath. The \nelectrodeposition bath consisted of 1.5 mM SbCl 3, 0.4 mM CuCl 2 and 18 mM Na 2S2O3. The \npotentials were applied in puls e form with respect to saturated calomel electrode, deposition \npotential (V on) was fixed at -0.72 V and dissolution potential (V off) was -0.1 V.   Films of \napproximately 500 nm were obtained after 300 cycles.   As deposited films were amorphous and \nthe films  were crystallized in chalcostibite phase after annealing at 300 \u00b0C in N 2/S atmosphere \nfor 30 minutes.  The estimated band gap of the films was 1.42 eV.  The films were photosensitive \nand there was an   increase in the conductivity of about one order. PEC m easurements were \ndone 0.1 M HSO using the films annealed at   300 \u00b0C which confirmed the  p-type conductivity of \nthe material.

In this work, a flexible heterojunction was \nobtained by chemical bath deposition on ITO -coated PET using CdS films as n -type \nsemiconductor and SnS films as p -type semiconductor.

The thickness of CdS \nfilm was varied to observe its influence on the CdS/SnS heterojunction parameters, such as, \nlattice mismatch, built -in voltage, potential barrier, and band alignments. The bandgap energies \nalignment determines the characteristics of the junction. Specular transmittance and r eflectance \nmeasurements were done to evaluate the absorption coefficient and band gap. The deposited \nCdS films shown a band gap of 2.49 eV while the SnS exhibits a band gap of 1.17 eV, this \ndifferences in band gap values promotes the formation of the heter ojunction called \u201cstaggered\u201d. \nX-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed polycrystalline CdS with a hexagonal structure, while SnS \nexhibits an orthorhombic structure, the deposition temperature for CdS was kept at 75 \u00b0C and \nfor SnS the deposition was carried o ut at 35 \u00b0C.

Cu 2O promises to be a good candidate as an absorbent material  in energy \nconversion applications. It is a non -toxic compound with low cost, and it is easy to produce by \ndifferent techniques. In addition, has good optical and electrical properties, such as a high \nabsorption coefficient of \u03b1 = 4 x  103 cm-1 and a band g ap energy ranging from 1.9 and 2.6 eV [1]. \nIn this work, CuO and Cu 2O thin films were obtained by deposition in a reactive magnetron \nsputtering system. The effect of oxygen flux (3 and 1.6 sccm) and substrate heating temperature \n(25 to 200 \u00b0C) on structura l and optical properties was studied. The results indicated that high \noxygen atmospheres (3 sccm) produce thin films with the CuO phase, while a low oxygen \natmosphere (1.6 sccm) results in thin films with the Cu 2O phase. The substrate heating \ntemperature i ncreases the crystallite size from 15 to 21 nm for CuO samples and from 7 to 8 nm \nfor Cu 2O samples. The evolution of the surface morphology goes from pyramidal grains to a \nsmooth surface. However, there is the formation of cracks in the CuO samples with in creasing \ntemperature, while in the Cu 2O samples, an improvement in surface morphology was observed. \nThe morphology evolves from a surface with cracks to a homogeneous surface with better -\ndefined and uniform grains. The thickness of the samples increased wh en the heating \ntemperature of the substrate increases. However, the band gap remains unchanged with the \nincrease in substrate temperature. All the samples present an absorption coefficient of 104 cm-\n1 in the 280 to 800 nm range, which favors their use as a bsorbent material for photovoltaic \napplications.  \nKeywords: Thin films, magnetron sputtering reactive, Cu 2O, absorbent materials, \nsemiconductors.  \nCorresponding author:  Anel Roc\u00edo  Carrasco -Hern\u00e1ndez:  anel.carrasco@cimav.edu.mx  \n[1] A.

The deposition \ntemperature of the films was 40 \u00b0C, deposits were carried out for different times, then the films \nwere subjected to heat treatments between 250 \u00b0C and 300 \u00b0C; the purpose of these films is the \napplication in solar cells. The following are proposed as the first configurations for such devices: \nTCO/SnS -Bi2S3/PbS and TCO/SnS -Bi2S3/SnS. The obtained films were characterized by X -ray \ndiffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and UV -Vis spectroscopy to \nknow their structural and optical properties.

The production of \nphotovoltaic cells metallic sulfides has taken a great boom since 2011 due to the present \nabundance of the compounds and their low toxicity. The noticeable advantage related to the \nuse of these materials comes the diverse methods of elaboration of a thin film. In the following \nwork, the S.I.L.A.R method is used to obtain thin films of tin oxide, cadmium sulfide, and zinc \nsulfide. Where it is intended to deposit said materials in a single thin film for the formation of a \nsemitransparent window buffer layer. It is worth mentioning that the chemical deposit \ntechnique used in this project handles different cycle times that are important to establish: \ndraining, and submerging time varies between each material to be deposi ted and favors the \nabsorption reaction in the substrate and the growth of the semitransparent film. A reaction \nmechanism is proposed for the first layer between glass and SnCl2 to explain the reaction that \ntakes place in it. The X -ray Diffraction (XRD) and  Raman spectroscopy studies showed that all the \nmultilayer films exhibited polycrystalline nature.

However, \nmetals in contact with biological systems are corroded; thus, patients implanted with metal \nprostheses usually suffer sequelae due to corrosion processes. Studies have shown that \nimplement ing ceramic coatings, as single or multilayers, substantially improves the corrosion \nresistance of various metal materials. In this work, Arc PVD biocompatible multilayer coatings \nbased on TiN/Ti on 17 -4 PH stainless steel have undergone a simulated physio logical \nenvironment to study the corrosion mechanisms.  \nThe adhesion and surface morphology of Arc -PVD coatings were analyzed by dynamic \nscratching, profilometry, and scanning electron microscopy. Likewise, coatings corrosion \nresistance was studied by poten tiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance \nspectroscopy (EIS) tests, using brine with a NaCl concentration of 3.5% w/w, as well as simulated \nbody fluid (SBF) and Hank solution.  \nAs is expected, a reduction in the corrosion rate of the coated spec imens was found in \ncomparison with 17 -4 PH stainless steel due to the presence of a protective layer at the surface. \nThe mechanisms involved in the corrosion phenomena are discussed. Finally, we found that \ncoatings with TiN/Ti architectures are excellent c andidates for the protection of medical devices.  \nKeywords:  TiN/Ti, Corrosion protection, Arc -PVD, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, \nPhysiological body fluids  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n421  \n \n[ THF -354 ] Synthesis of ZnO -Ag/Cu nanocomposites by \ncombining Sol -Gel and LASL.  \nL.

It has shown high photocatalytic activity and good photostability \nand is a low -cost material. TiO 2 can be found in three different crystalline phases  such as rutile, \nanatase, and brookite. The presence of these phases can contribute to a better performance in \ndifferent photocatalytic processes, such as dye degradation, hydrogen production, and CO 2 \nphotoreduction. In this sense, thin films of TiO 2 were deposited by the sputtering method to be \nused as photocatalysts in hydrogen production. The films were deposited at different working \npressures to achieve the presence of the three characteristic phases of TiO 2. The structural, \noptical, and electrochemical  properties were studied using X -ray diffraction techniques, UV -Vis \nspectroscopy, and electrochemical measurements.

On the \nother hand, bismuth sulfide (Bi 2S3) has suitable electrical and optical (Eg ~ 1.5 eV)   properties for \nsolar cell applications. Herein, we incorporate Bi 2S3 nanorods into the Cs 3Bi2I9 thin film in a \nsingle -step ultrasonic spray deposition adding thioacetamide (TA) in the Cs -Bi-I precursor \nsolution. The concentration of the TA in the solution was varied from 0.01 to 0.05 M, at a given \nsubstrate temperature. The fi lms formed are investigated in detail using XRD, Raman \nspectroscopy, SEM and UV -Vis-NIR spectroscopy. At lower concentrations, we show that the \nthioacetamide can behave as a complexing agent in the spray solution which leads to controlled \npyrolysis at the substrate surface resulting in high -quality polycrystalline films. The Cs 3Bi2I9 has \na hexagonal structure (P6 3/mmc) and the films are preferentially oriented along (006) direction \nperpendicular to the substrate. Moreover, the thin films (thickness ~300 nm)  have excellent \nuniformity as evident from the morphology probed by the scanning electron microscopy. The \nthin films demonstrate a superior absorption coefficient up to the order of ~105 cm-1 in the \nvisible region with a calculated direct band gap of aroun d 2 eV. The conductive Bi 2S3 nanorods \nin the composite films enhance the dark current in the Cs 3Bi2I9 thin films from ~0.08 nA to ~1 \nnA, whereas, the lower band gap of ~1.5 eV increases photocurrent. Furthermore, we evaluate \nthe thickness dependence of the  best photosensitive thin films in photodetector as well as \nphotovoltaic heterojunction with CdS.  \nKeywords: Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis; Cs 3Bi2I9 Thin films; Bi 2S3 nanorods; Photodetectors  \nAuthor for Correspondence: kbindu_k@yahoo.com  \nReference : Devasia, S. ; Shaji, S.; Avellaneda, D.

The new generation of \ntechnology required low power operation, low cost of fabricat ion, and high level integration of \nvarious functions. Therefore, the knowledge of these devices allow to develop the building \nblocks for digital gate circuits and several analog circuits in the current modern electronics [1]. \nHowever, the bottleneck for th eir commercialization is due to the missing understanding of \nthese devices. Therefore, the development of 2D models for numerical simulations considering \nthe density of states (DOS) to be incorporated into analytical models for circuit simulation \nprograms (SPICE), in order to design logic gates or analog circuits for novel applications.

It is well known that the solid state gold \nfilms shows a dewetting behavior during heat treatment.  However, in this work, the evolution of \nthe optical properties of gold nanoislands as a function of temperature, as well as the initial \nfilling fraction of the gold deposit, is studied. The filling fraction was controlled through \nmeasuring   the electrical  properties of the deposited material during the evaporationthe and \nfitting this to   percolation theory. Four differents granular gold films with different filling \nfractions were deposited: 0.28, 0.42, 0.49 and 0.87. The deposits obtained were isothermally  \ntreated at different temperatures between 150 and 450 degrees centigrade. The material \ndeposited in the evaporator hood was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry. \nAbsorbance measurements of the heat treated deposits were analyzed with a Cary 5000 \nspectrophotometer. As expected, the particle size depends on the heat treatment temperature. \nHowever, it is observed that the initial filling fraction of the gold films is also important in the \nformation of nanoparticles on the surface. According to the th eoretical adjustments of the \nabsorption spectra to the Maxwell Garnett theory, it is inferred that while the filling fraction is \nlower, the particle size decreases and also the particle size distribution becomes more uniform \nas heat treatment temperature i ncreases and the initial filler fraction decreases.  \nKeywords:  granular films, percolation, thermal evaporation, dewetting, absortion  \nAuthor for correspondence:  eviguerass@uaemex.mx  \nThis work was supported by  CONACyT Mexico, grant number A1 -S-33899  \n  \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n428  \n \n[ THF -95 ] EVALUATION OF SiO2@TiO2 COMPOSITE AS A \nHYDROPHOBIC AND ANTIFUNGAL BARRIER FOR APPLICATION \nAS A PACKAGE COATING.  \nHugo Alberto Mandujano G \u00f3mez (hugo.almg99@hotmail.com) 1 , Alicia Rosales P \u00e9rez 1 , Jos\u00e9 Antonio \nCervantes Ch \u00e1vez 2 , Karen Esquivel Escalante (karen.esquivel@uaq.mx) 1  \n1 Graduate and Research Division Engineering Faculty, Universidad Aut \u00f3noma de Quer \u00e9taro, Cerro \nde las Campanas, C.P. 76010, Santiago de Quer \u00e9taro, Quer \u00e9taro, M \u00e9xico \n2 Natural Sciences Faculty, Universidad Aut \u00f3noma de Quer \u00e9taro, C arr. a Chichimequillas S/N, Ejido \nBola \u00f1os, C.P. 76140, Santiago de Quer \u00e9taro, Quer \u00e9taro, M \u00e9xico.  \nPackage materials have wide use in the alimentary industry.

The coating was synthesized by the sol -gel method coupled to \nsonochemistry with tw o different cavitation times, 30 min (S30) and 40 min (S40). The composite \nwas obtained from the mixture of two sols of SiO2 and TiO2 under ultrasonic bath conditions. \nXRD analyzed the crystallinity of the material. The diffraction peak at 28.7 \u00b0 correspon ds to the \n(110) plane of the rutile phase of TiO2, confirming its presence in the material.

In its natural state, zirconia has a monoclinic crystalline structure that is \npreserved from room temperature up to 1150\u00b0C, known as unstabilized zirconia. At this \ntemperature, a martensitic transformatio n to a tetragonal structure occurs. Above 2370\u00b0C, the \noxide exhibits a stable cubic crystalline structure until melting at 2650\u00b0C. When the zirconium \ndioxide has a nanocrystallite size around 25 nm, the tetragonal phase can be maintained at \nroom temperatur e. In the present work we show the results of ZrO 2 thin films calcined at 250 \nand 550 \u00b0C, created by using the sol -gel and dip -coating technique. In the XRD results we can \nobserve a good quality of the thin films which were identified and analyzed. The par ticle size \ncalculation was performed as well as the preferential orientation. In addition, a surface analysis \nof the thin films is presented. The crystallite sizes are in a range 15.6 to 19.6 nm.

Even though this material \nsees wide use in our modern industry, it is still ripe for testing in new applications by taking \nadvantage of modern growth techniques & methods, as well as alloy technologies. In this study, \nwe str ived to initially obtain crystalline SiC grown on amorphous SiO 2 (glass) substrates in order \nto fuel further experiments with this material. Using R.F. Magnetron Sputtering, we were able to \ngrow SiC thin films through traditional growth routes & a novel ramping method, as well as \ncharacterizing them through AFM Microsc opy, Spectroscopic Ellipsometry & Raman \nSpectroscopy. These characterization techniques allowed us to obtain valuable information on \nsurface morphology, band gap energy and crystalline phase. AFM measurements presented a \nperiodic grain pattern akin to terr aces with quadrilateral grains, a radically different geometry \nwhen compared to traditional semiconductor and SiC surfaces. On the other hand, band gaps \nwere in order of traditional SiC polytypes, which we believe were confirmed through the Raman \nspectra o btained, revealing a mix of different phases like 3C, 2H and 6H SiC polytypes. Even \nthough no current application is planned for this material, these studies will allow us to further \ndevelop SiC growth methods to manipulate the material properties for its wider use as a \nsemiconductor, including control of crystal phase with growth parameters & band gap \nengineering through alloys.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n431  \n \n[ THF -258 ] Influence of Diamond Thin Films Growth Processes \nas Perspective for Planar Optical Waveguides Application.  \nJorge  Arturo Montes Guti \u00e9rrez (jorge.montes@unison.mx) 2 , Jorge Luis V \u00e1zquez Arce 1 , Jorge Adolfo \nJurado Gonz \u00e1lez 1 , Angela Yulieth Marin G \u00f3mez 1 , Jes\u00fas Javier Alcantar Pe \u00f1a 4 , Frank Romo Garc \u00eda 3 , \nRafael Garc \u00eda Guti \u00e9rrez 6 , Hugo Jes \u00fas Tiznado V \u00e1zquez 2 , Orlando Auciello 5 , Oscar Edel Contreras \nL\u00f3pez 2  \n1 Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  Cient \u00edfica y Educaci \u00f3n Superior de Ensenada - CICES  \n2 Centro de Nanociencias y Nanotecnolog \u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut \u00f3noma de M \u00e9xico \n3 Department of Physics, Enginee ring and Mathematics.

The \nconsidered  methodologies were  intermetallic deposition of titanium (Ti) film, physicochemical \nmodification by reactive oxygen ions, and chemical functionalization of PMMA surfaces with thiol \ngroups  through cysteamine treatments. The hydrophobicity of the surfaces after the treatme nts \nwas measured by the contact angle technique. Cysteamine functionalization was verified by UV -\nvisible measurements. The feasibility of the proposals was assessed with ultrasonic vibration \nand detachment tests. According to UV -visible measurements, funct ionalization of PMMA \nsurfaces with cysteamine is achieved by pretreatment with UV light. The results of the tests \nreport that at higher contact angles (>110\u00b0), the greater the adherence of the Au films. Although \nthe methodologies were tested separately, ad hesion of 150 -nm-thick Au film was achieved using \nthe combination of two of these methodologies: treatment in O 2 plasma followed by deposition \nof a Ti film. These results can be used for fabrication of electronic devices on PMMA substrates.  \nKeywords: Thin film, PMMA substrate, plasma treatment, e -beam evaporation, \nfunctionalization.  \nAuthor for correspondence: jlherrera@cideteq.mx  \n[1] C.

One of the most interesting materials is \nnickel oxide (NiO) due to its natural p -type conductivity, high transmittance in the visible range \nand high chemical stability [1]. NiO is also a good candidate for op toelectronic devices and \nresistive memories. In this study, NiO x thin films were deposited by r.f. magnetron sputtering of \nNiO target at room temperature and powers in the range of 40 \u2013 80 W. After the deposition, part \nof the films were annealed at 450 oC for 1 h to form nanocrystals. The as -deposited and annealed \nfilms were characterized by ellipsometry, XRD, AFM and XPS. Heterojunction diodes were \nfabricated by deposition of thin NiO x layers on n -type Si. The photoresponse of the diodes was \nstudied by c urrent -voltage measurements in dark and under UV and visible light irradiation. The \nobtained responsivity (R) depended  on the r.f. power and was higher for the annealed diodes. \nThe highest values of R, between ~30 and 65 A/W for light with wavelengths in t he 365 -635 nm \nrange, were found for annealed diodes with NiO x deposited at 60 W. These values of R are \namong the highest ones reported for broadband photodetectors.  \nKeywords: nickel oxide, sputtering, NiOx/n -Si, photodetectors, high responsivity.  \nAuthor for correspondence: nicolan@uabc.edu.mx  \nReference : X.

A region of unreacted \nYSZ remained with its prominent ionic conductivity in -between regions. Thus, YSZ acts like a n/i/p \njunction.  \n1. Switching off a high electric field leads to a drastic increase to the steady -state or the initial \nstate, respectively. This is even m ore pronounced if the temperature is reduced before or at the \ntime of switching. This determines whether stored memory or the internal reaction products, \nrespectively, become volatile or not in memristors.  \n 2. The model used in the present study is applica ble to flash sintering explaining the onset of \nincreased electronic conductivity, which finally triggers more Joule heating in a self -accelerating \nway.  \n 3. The model used in this study assumes a flat interface between the reacted and unreacted \nYSZ. Whether  this occurs or whether finger and filament type excursions of the interface appear \ncould be a matter of driving voltage and temperature. The agreement between experimental \nresults and the model supports the assumption of a flat interface at least within t he temperature \nand voltage range used in this study  \n 4. The present analysis applies to other oxides besides YSZ as well. It could also be used to \nexplain incubation times or lifetimes for other electric field -driven processes like the breakdown \nof high -k materials or the formation of memristors.  \nKeywords:   Yttria -stabilized zirconia polycrystal;  Electrical resistivity/conductivity;  Atomic layer \ndeposition (ALD);  Diffusion;  Single charged vacancies  \nSeveral projects supported this work: FORDECYT Grants No. 272894 and 21077; CONACyT Grant \nNo. A1 -S-21084, A1 -S-26789, A1 -S-21323.

FeS 2 has a narrow band gap, high light absorption \ncoefficient, excellent properties in photoelectric conversion and has enormous potentia l as an \nefficient photodetector system [1]. This opens our possibility of tuning the material for various \napplications using its nanostructures and thin films. Pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL), a cost \neffective, facile and chemically clean method has been adopted for  successfully synthesizing \npyrite (FeS 2) nanoparticles. In this study, we synthesized FeS 2 nanoparticles in different solvents \n(IPA, DMF) by laser ablation using Nd:YAG laser output of 532 nm wavelength. Morphology of \nthe nanoparticles was identified by tr ansmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the \nnanoparticles show different morphologies in these solvents. For thin film fabrication from \nnanocolloid, we present a simple and convenient method combining electrophoretic deposition \n(EPD) and spin -coating. FeS 2 nanoparticles in IPA were deposited on n -type silicon (Si) substrate \nby EPD followed by spin -coating of FeS 2 (NPs in IPA and DMF) on the surface of these films for \nsurface morphological modification and to enhance thickness of the films. Photodiode \nconfi gurations of n -Si/p-FeS 2 is achieved using the nanocolloids in IPA and DMF. Annealing of \nthese structures is also done in vacuum at different temperatures. The optical properties of the \ncolloids and films were evaluated using UV -Visible spectroscopy. The s urface morphologies were \nstudied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman studies confirmed the phases. \nThe crystalline structure of the films was characterized by X -ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. We \nreport the photodetection properties of a p -n junction based on these FeS 2 nanoparticles on Si \nand the results of light sensing parameters evaluated will be presented.  \nKeyword s : Pyrite (FeS 2) nanoparticles; Pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL); Electrophoretic \ndeposition (EPD); Spin -coating; Photo diode  \nAuthor for Correspondence  : akshana2770@gmail.com  \nReference : [1] M.

MCs are optical resonators which confine the \nlight of the  target wavelength  in the spacer layer plane.  MCs are commonly used in \nsemiconductor vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) devices, where quantum wells \n(QW) of a semiconductor such as GaAs are embedded in the spacer. The MC can be \nmicropatterned  to form mesas, waveguides or pillars to manipulate the light by means of wet \nor dry chemical etching combined with lithographic techniques, which are demanding in terms \nof infrastructure and expertise. In this work, we demonstrate that micropatterning can  be \nachieved by embedding a thin metallic layer within the MC. We show that the metallic layer net \neffect is that of increasing the resonance wavelength of the MC, thereby allowing to form \narbitrary planar photonic potentials by standard lithography method s, and subsequently \ncovering it with the rest of the thin layers to complete the MC device. These novel technique \noffers a simpler option to existing MC patterning techniques, with the additional advantage of \nthe possibility to use the metallic pattern as an electrical contact to locally manipulate the \nelectrons and/or holes within the active zone of a VCSEL, for example. Besides its use in VCSELs, \nit can also be applied to manipulate photon -exciton quasiparticles called polaritons in MC -based \ndevices worki ng in the so -called strong -coupling regime. Polaritons can sustain quantum \nmacroscopic states, or condensates, which can thus be manipulated by means of \nmicropatterning of the MC to form, for example, periodic potentials  analogue to  the optical \npotentials used to manipulate atomic Bose -Einstein condensates.  \nKeywords : Optical Microcavities, Photonic Crystals  \nAuthor for correspondence:  edgar.cerda@uaslp.mx  \n \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n439  \n \n[ THF -330 ]  STRUCTURAL, CHEMICAL, AND MIR RESPONSE OF COVELLITE \nCuS FILMS AS OPAQUE LOW -E COATINGS  \nAxel Agust \u00edn Ort \u00edz Atondo (axel.ortiz@cimav.edu.mx) 3 , Zeuz Montiel Gonz \u00e1lez 1 , Zeuz Montiel Gonz \u00e1lez 5 , Dalia \nAlejandra Maz \u00f3n Montijo 2 , Dalia Alejandra Maz \u00f3n Montijo 5 , Axel Agust \u00edn Ort \u00edz Atondo 5 , Obed Yam \u00edn Ram \u00edrez \nEsquivel 5 , Dagoberto Cabrera German 7 , Jorge Alejandro Torres Ochoa 4 , Dagoberto Cabrera German 6  \n1 CONACYT - Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n  en Materiales Avanzados S.

Thus, studying materials to \ncontrol solar radiation is a current topic, where covellite CuS (CuS -cov) looks for an opportunity \nas partially opaque Low -E coating. This work explores the relationshi p between structural and \nchemical properties of SILAR deposited CuS -cov films, determining the impact on the Mid \nInfrared (MIR) response to evaluate their capabilities for Low -E application. Rietveld refinement, \ntogether with the compositional analysis, ev idence the high control of the synthesis and stability \nof a nanocrystalline single phase of stoichiometric CuS -cov (from the XPS analysis an average \nS/Cu ratio close to 1:1 was obtained for all samples, taking in consideration the three \nenvironments for S atoms: trigonal, tetrahedral, and S -S bonds). The optical behavior in the MIR \nrevealed the impact of the CuS -cov growth, evaluated through the thickness, crystallinity, and \ncomposition, as an increasing reflectivity, reaching 80% in the Thermal Infrared fo r deposition \ncycles \u226575 (110 nm). With these results, we demonstrate that when the reflectivity of the films is \nmaximized in the Thermal Infrared, these opaque CuS -cov Low -E coatings have emissivities \nbetween 0.1 and 0.2 (these values were calculated and e stimated applying Kirchhoff\u2019s Law and \nHagen -Rubens equation for metals), among the lowest reported for commercial transparent \nconductive oxides. These results contribute to the current investigation to place the CuS -cov \nfilms among the Low -E coatings with high potential.  \nKeyword:  Covellite, SILAR, Low -E, Emissivity, MIR reflectance.                                                                       \nAutor for correspondence:  axel.ortiz@cimav.edu.mx, dalia.mazo n@itnl.edu.mx     \nReference:  Montiel -Gonz\u00e1lez, Z. et al.

This motivates to control the pesticides used, as well as \ntheir concentration in plants. This requires the development of technologies that are efficient \nand capable of being used in -situ. A promising  alternative is to develop sensors based on \nplasmonic devices due to their high sensitivity to changes in the environment.

Actualmente debido a diversos \nproblemas como la contaminaci\u00f3n y la sobre explotaci\u00f3n de recursos como  los combustibles \nf\u00f3siles se ha llevado una b\u00fasqueda extensa para aprovechar fuentes de energ\u00eda renovables. \nDentro de estas energ\u00edas renovables, la energ\u00eda que proviene del sol tiene el potencial de ser \naprovechada utilizando celdas solares que convierten directamente la luz solar en electricidad. \nUna alternativa que ha llamado la atenci\u00f3n, dentro de las diferentes aplicaciones de las celdas \nsolares, es el uso de celdas solares semitransparentes como parte de ventanas de los edificios.  \nEste tipo de celdas p resenta la ventaja de ser instaladas directamente en los edificios, generando \nla energ\u00eda directamente donde se necesita eliminando los costos y dificultades de transportar \nla energ\u00eda, adem\u00e1s de ser est\u00e9ticamente atractivas para aplicaciones arquitect\u00f3nicas . Para \nlograr este tipo de aplicaci\u00f3n es necesario realizar investigaci\u00f3n acerca de la selecci\u00f3n y \ndesarrollo de materiales que cumplan con las caracter\u00edsticas \u00f3pticas y electr\u00f3nicas para \naprovechar la luz solar, mientras permiten su desempe\u00f1o normal como ventana. \nAdicionalmente a las propiedades de los materiales, el procesamiento presenta un rol muy \nimportante.

Uno de estos aspectos es el transporte de la energ\u00eda generada hasta el consumidor \nfinal. Los c\u00e1lculos te\u00f3ricos muestran que es suficiente cubrir tan solo el 1% de la superficie \nterrestre con celdas fotovoltaicas para cubrir las  necesidades energ\u00e9ticas de todo el planeta. En \nla pr\u00e1ctica resulta que las ubicaciones con mayor consumo energ\u00e9tico se encuentran en zonas \nfr\u00edas, con pocos d\u00edas de cielo despejado al a\u00f1o \u2013 ubicaciones menos favorables para las \ninstalaciones fotovoltaicas.  Por otro lado, hay zonas limitadas del planeta, llamadas cinturones \nsolares, que cuentan con las caracter\u00edsticas adecuadas para una efectiva generaci\u00f3n. \nAfortunadamente M\u00e9xico se encuentra en una de estas zonas privilegiadas, lo cual le brinda un \ngran pot encial para ser un pa\u00eds altamente solar -energ\u00e9tico, siempre y cuando existan los \nespecialistas preparados y cuenten con la infraestructura adecuada para la planeaci\u00f3n, \ngeneraci\u00f3n, distribuci\u00f3n y almacenamiento de la energ\u00eda fotovoltaica \u2013 lo que forma part e \ncentral de esta charla de divulgaci\u00f3n.  \nOtro tema importante que se cubre en esta charla  es la aplicaci\u00f3n de la energ\u00eda solar fotovoltaica \nen el transporte.

Otro gran avance es el monitoreo de los signos vitales de los astronautas a distancia \ndando origen a la telemedicina, la cual se aprovecha para las zonas muy remotas en donde es dif\u00edcil contar \ncon m\u00e9dicos. El comportamiento del cuerpo humano en ingravidez ha permitido el desarrollo de sistemas \nde asistencias a personas con discapacidad motriz, el uso de brazos rob\u00f3ticos con movimientos precisos \nen las naves espaciales, han conducido al desarrollo de los robots de cirug\u00eda, as\u00ed como los equipos de \nultrasonido para el diagn\u00f3stico.

Entre los distintos \ntipos de energ\u00eda renovable, la fotovoltaica resulta muy atractiva para reemplazar ya sea \nparcialmente o totalmente los combustibles f\u00f3siles tradicionales que contaminan el medio \nambiente, ya que es capaz d e transformar de manera directa la energ\u00eda proveniente del Sol en \nelectricidad.

Por tanto, durante las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, se tiene un incremento del \nconsumo energ\u00e9tico de la sociedad que busca contrarrestar condiciones ambientales extremas \na trav\u00e9s del uso desmedido de sistemas de aire acondicionado (SAA) en edificaciones, \nprincipalmente. El uso de vidrio como material arquitect\u00f3nico ha favorecido esta problem\u00e1tica, \nya que permite el paso del 86% de la energ\u00eda proveniente de la radiaci\u00f3n sola r fomentando el \nuso de los SAA. Dentro de la gran variedad de propuestas estudiadas para mitigar este \nproblema, algunas ya han alcanzado aplicaciones reales en pa\u00edses extranjeros como los \nrecubrimientos de control solar los cuales permiten el paso de radia ci\u00f3n visible y reflejan la \nradiaci\u00f3n infrarroja (principal responsable de la sensaci\u00f3n de calor).

Detr\u00e1s de esto, la ciencia y tecnolog\u00eda de los materiales ha jugado un \npapel fundamental. Puntualizando en la industria del maquinado, las herramientas de corte y \nperforaci\u00f3n han alcanzado un grado de especializaci\u00f3n muy alto. Es precis amente este grado \nde especializaci\u00f3n junto con el desarrollo y exigencia  industriales lo que ha originado que se \nest\u00e9 interesado en aumentar la vida \u00fatil de estas herramientas, mejorando sus propiedades \npara que puedan operar sobre superficies m\u00e1s duras, alcanzar mayores velocidades de uso, \nresistir a la corrosi\u00f3n y a altas temperaturas de trabajo. Estas mejoras se han dado gracias a un \n\u00e1rea interdisciplinaria de ciencia de materiales que consiste en el desarrollo de recubrimientos \no pel\u00edculas delgadas. Un  ejemplo aplica cuando recubrimos con pintura las rejas met\u00e1licas de \nnuestras casas, favoreciendo a que no se oxiden con facilidad, adem\u00e1s de hacerlas lucir mejor. \nEl caso m\u00e1s com\u00fan en las herramientas es el nitruro de titanio, TiN, el cual es aplicado a l as \nbrocas d\u00e1ndoles un color dorado caracter\u00edstico con espesores de unos cuantos micr\u00f3metros. \nAs\u00ed como el TiN, han surgido m\u00e1s y mejores recubrimientos como el TiAlN, el cu\u00e1l adem\u00e1s de \nincrementar la dureza de la herramienta, ofrece mayor resistencia a la o xidaci\u00f3n y corrosi\u00f3n \ngracias a la incorporaci\u00f3n del Al. Estos sistemas son depositados principalmente por procesos \nf\u00edsicos como sputtering, que consiste en arrancar \u00e1tomos del metal a depositar mediante un \nproceso f\u00edsico, an\u00e1logo al juego de billar. En est a pl\u00e1tica se discutir\u00e1   la incorporaci\u00f3n de m\u00e1s \nmetales para el desarrollo de recubrimientos de nitruros multielementales de alto desorden, \ndenominados de alta entrop\u00eda, con el fin de mejorar a\u00fan m\u00e1s su rendimiento.  \n \n  \n SOCIEDAD MEXICANA DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE SUPERFICIES Y \nMATERIALES A.C.  \nXV INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SURFACES, MATERIALS AND VACUUM  \n                                       SEPTEMBER 26 -29TH,2022 PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO  \n \n \n458  \n \n[ SCD -386 ] \u00bfQu\u00e9 tanto sabes del agua?  \nMario Fidel Garc\u00ed a S\u00e1nchez (mgarciasan@ipn.mx) 1  \n1 Unidad Profesional Interdisciplinaria de Ingenier\u00ed a y Tecnolog\u00ed as Avanzadas, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico \nNacional, Av.
