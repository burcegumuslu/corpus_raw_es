His \ufb01rst publication \non Spanish colonial law,\nIntroducci\u00f3n al estudio del derecho Indiano (1916), can \nlargely be viewed as a foundational wo rk for the discipline in conjunction \nwith subsequent publications that further elaborate on this topic (e. g. Le-vene 1918, 1924). Between the late 1930s and 1940s, other scholars, like Rafael Altamira (Altamira 1938, 1939, 1948), Jorge Basadre (1937), Ots Cap-dequi (1943), and Manuel Belaunde Guinassi (1947), took it upon them-\nselves to build on the notion of\nderecho indiano and in general on Levene\u2019s \nwork, which itself had been in \ufb02uenced by his own teachers and developed in \nclose collaboration with other jurists and historians (Levene 1953; Tau \nAnzo\u00e1tegui 1990, 2006). From the 1950s on, Alfonso Garc\u00eda-Gallo of Spain emerged as the leading scholar in the \ufb01eld (Garc\u00eda-Gallo 1951, 1952, 1953, \n1955). For the next three decades, his writings would set the agenda for legal historical studies on the overseas terr itories of the Spanish crown. Together \nwith Alamiro \u00c1vila-Martel and Ricardo Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa, Garc\u00eda-Gallo founded the Instituto Internacional de la Historia del Derecho Indiano \n(IIHDI) in 1966. With his keynote address entitled\nProblemas metodol\u00f3gicos \nde la historia del derecho indiano (Garc\u00eda-Gallo, 1967), held at the \ufb01rst interna-\ntional meeting of legal historians working on the derecho indiano , he set the \nagenda for further research. In his subsequent works, he presented impor-\ntant re \ufb02ections and advances in research methods and key topics concerning \nderecho indiano (Garc\u00eda-Gallo 1970, 1972, 1987). In this regard, the manifold \ncontributions of scholars from both sides of the Atlantic cannot be empha-sized enough, for it is no exaggeration to state that for more than two decades, both Latin American and Spanish scholarship relied on the episte-mic framework delineated by Garc\u00eda-Gallo, to which leading scholars of the \nsubsequent generation, like Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui (1993), Martir\u00e9 (1996), and \nIntroduction: New Horizons of Derecho Indiano 1S\u00e1nchez Bella (1996), testify. Moreover, since its foundation, the IIHDI has \nbeen organizing a series of congresses at locations alternating between Spain \nand Latin America. This has helped to build a transnational scholarly com-\nmunity that serves as a forum for debates and scholarly exchanges. The published\nacta of the IIHDI conferences provide an excellent window to \nthe state of the research within the \ufb01eld between the 1970s and the 1990s \n( D el aH e r ae ta l . ,1 9 8 9 ) .1\nNearly thirty years later, in 1995, the 11thCongress of the same Institute, \nheld in Buenos Aires, heralded the revival of the discipline, when the Argen-tinian legal historian, V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui, seized the opportunity to address questions on methodology and on the future orientations of the \ndiscipline. In so doing, he also invoked the writings of European legal \nhistorians like Paolo Grossi, Antonio Manuel Hespanha, Bartolom\u00e9 Clavero, \nand others. At the same time, he drew on his own intense legal historical research carried out in the previous decades, starting with research on the codi\ufb01cation of civil law in Argentina (Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui 1977) and working his \nway through to the foundational structures of\nderecho indiano (Tau Anzo\u00e1-\ntegui 1992), demonstrating sound historiographical re\ufb02 ection (Tau Anzo\u00e1-\ntegui 1990, 1993, 1996). His inaugural lecture at the 11thCongress, which \nwas published in 1997 under the title Nuevos Horizontes en el Estudio Hist\u00f3rico \ndel Derecho Indiano (Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui 1997), can be considered part of a \nbroader tendency to revisit and re \ufb02ect upon the early scholarship on derecho \nindiano undertaken by the \ufb01rst two generations of legal historians from \nLatin America and Europe, especially from Spain, that generated compre-hensive bibliographical studies in the 1980s and the 1990s.\n2\nAt the outset, Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui proposes going beyond conceiving the \nparadigm of legal history purely as a history of legal norms. He \ufb01rst describes \ntheMethodenstreit of the 1970s, which had considerable in \ufb02uence on how \nlegal history \u2013 and Spanish colonial law \u2013 was understood, in that either \n1 For a list of the Congresses with a complete digital library of all the publications of the \nCongress see: http://web.ua.es/es/institutoderechoindiano/.\n2 Outstanding in this context is the work of D agrossa (1998); see also B ernal G\u00f3mez\n(1989); D el a Heraet al.

Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui now linked the \nmethodological development of legal history to what he called \u201cthe posture superseding rational and statutory state law, \u201d\n3so that normativity, as it was \nnow being conceived by scholars, related more to the autonomy of di fferent \nlevels of social organization, di fferent modes of normative creativity, diverse \nnotions of law and justice, the jurist\u2019s position as an artifact of law, and the casuistic character of legal decisions. All of these, according to Tau Anzo\u00e1-tegui, were now to be seen as alternatives to the old conception of law as a matter of state hegemony. This changed conception of modern law opened \nup new horizons for legal historians and scholars of Spanish colonial law, \naiding them to broaden their understanding of the workings of previous laws.\n4But the wider conception of normativity advocated by Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui \nalso led him to make an appeal to the legal historians to use a broader array of sources in the study of legal norms than just the textual sources. Scholars \nhad to \u201csubstitute the\nlegalist culture for a juridical culture, which would \npermit [the scholar] to place the law in its proper place within the [social] \nsystem, depending on the substance and the epoch, and which would enable an \u2018intelligent reading\u2019 \u2013 which is neither ingenuous nor malicious \u2013 of the legal texts, asking them questions in the light of a wide conception of the \nlegal phenomenon. \u201d\n5\nFurthermore, Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui elevated certain areas of Spanish colonial \nlaw, which he thought deserved more attention than they had hitherto \nreceived. One such area was the history of the learned jurist, or the letrado , \nwho was to be studied within the social, political, economic and bureau-cratic context. Another neglected area that Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui identi\ufb01ed was book history: the circulation of printed books, libraries, and the di fferent \n3 \u00ab [\u2026] una postura superadora del dominante Derecho racional, estatal y legal. \u00bb, T au \nAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 20.\n4TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 19\u201320.\n5TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 43. \u00ab [\u2026] reemplazar la cultura legalista por la cultura jur\u00eddica, \nque permita colocar a la ley dentro del ordenamiento en su verdadero lugar, seg\u00fan la \nmateria y las \u00e9poca, y que posibilite una \u2018lectura inteligente\u2019 \u2013 que no es ingenua ni \nmaliciosa \u2013 de los textos legales, interrog\u00e1ndolos a la luz de una concepci \u00f3na m p l i ad e l  \nfen\u00f3meno jur\u00eddico. \u00bb\nIntroduction: New Horizons of Derecho Indiano 3interpretations of legal texts. Provincial and local derecho indiano had \nreceived scant scholarly attention, so that even a \u201cmicrohistory\u201d was well \nwithin the scope of the endeavor. And last but not least, Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui \nwished to see more scholarship on the \u201ccontinuities and ruptures\u201d of colo-nial legal legacy in the nineteenth century, in the a ftermath of the colonial \nperiod.\n6\nTau Anzo\u00e1tegui\u2019s \u201cnew horizons\u201d were thus wide open: even if he had not \nenvisaged a comprehensive revolution of the \ufb01eld, his program paved the \nway for revising the history of Spanish colonial law in order to gain a radically new understanding of it. While his positions were far from radical as far as historical scholarship was concerned, within the mainstream Latin American legal history and\nderecho indiano , his voice was authoritative. There \nis no doubt that areas of research in many \ufb01elds that Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui iden-\nti\ufb01ed as important have witnessed major progress in the ensuing two dec-\nades.\nHowever, in the seventeen years that have passed since Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui\u2019s \nprogrammatic declaration \ufb01rst appeared, new challenges have also emerged. \nThe challenges of globalization are felt both in the historical and the legal sciences, and thus, unsurprisingly, also in the \ufb01eld of legal history. Broader \nissues have experienced resurgence as a result, for instance, the importance accorded to religious normativity within the normative setting of societies is a direct result of that. They have raised awareness of the need to reconceive \nthe circulation of ideas and juridical practices, and reiterated the signi \ufb01cance \nof drawing attention to the layers of cultural translation that these ideas \nunderwent in the process of reinterpretation in di fferent contexts. Not least, \nthe growing consciousness of and the strong call to reconsider and inter-\nrogate colonial history fro m the postcolonial perspective unexpectedly neces-\nsitated a thorough reexamination of the foundational concepts of the disci-\npline. What concept of law best serves our historical studies in consideration o ft h em u l t i n o r m a t i v es e t t i n g s ?H o wd ow ed e \ufb01ne the spatial dimension of \nour work? How do we analyze the entanglements in legal history? Even if \nthe answer may at \ufb01rst glance seem rather easy, endless controversies have \nerupted every time scholars have tried to rede \ufb01ne these pivotal terms.\nThe aim of this volume is not to serve in the same capacity as Tau Anzo\u00e1-\ntegui\u2019s book from 1997, which essentially reoriented a whole discipline\u2019s \n6TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 57\u2013126.\n4 Thomas Duve, Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kiresearch agenda. Rather, it draws rich insights from Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui\u2019s work \nin order to address some new challenges confronting the discipline. Not \nleast, it hopes to help to integrate the study on derecho indiano into a broader \n\ufb01eld, especially with research in the English-speaking world. It starts and \nends with some considerations regarding the historiography of derecho In-\ndiano : Luigi Nuzzo\u2019s introduction re \ufb02ects upon the history of the historiog-\nraphy, and Ezequiel Ab\u00e1solo o ffers a dedication to Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui\u2019s work. \nRichard Ross, Tamar Herzog and Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4ki present three studies, which integrate\nderecho indiano into an Atlantic perspective. Brian Owensby, \nMarta Lorente and V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui take up key aspects that Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui had raised in his\nNuevos Horizontes .\nTogether, the contributions, which were the result of a small workshop in \nBerlin, in June 2012, show that many of Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui\u2019s wishes, which he expressed in\nNuevos Horizontes in 1997, have indeed borne fruit. But even if \nconsiderable results have been achieved. It is equally clear that new demands are being placed on the study of\nderecho indiano . Some of the new questions \nhave been treated in this volume, but much remains to be done. Twenty \nyears aft er the 11thCongress of the IIHDI , where Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui presented \nhis re\ufb02 ections on Nuevos Horizontes , many of these challenges will have to be \ndiscussed on a global scale. If this volume helps to shed light on these New \nHorizons , its goal will have been achieved.\nBibliography\nAltamira ,Rafael (1938), La legislaci \u00f3n indiana como elemento de la historia de las \nideas coloniales espa\u00f1olas, in: Revista de Historia de Am\u00e9rica 1, 1\u201324\nAltamira ,Rafael (1939), T\u00e9cnica de la investigaci \u00f3ne nl ah i s t o r i ad e ld e r e c h oi n d i a -\nno, M\u00e9xico\nAltamira ,Rafael (1948), Manual de investigaci \u00f3nd el ah i s t o r i ad e ld e r e c h oi n d i a -\nno, M\u00e9xico\nBasadre ,Jorge (1937), Historia del derecho peruano (Nociones generales.

Ross\nSpanish American and British American Law\nas Mirrors to Each Other: Implications of the Missing\nDerecho Brit\u00e1nico Indiano\nMost of the essays in this volume, proceeding in the spirit of Victor Tau \nAnzo\u00e1tegui\u2019s distinguished scholarship, pursue \u201cnew horizons\u201d in the study of Spanish American law. Co-editors Thomas Duve and Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4ki charged me with a di fferent mission. They asked me, a student of British \nNorth American law in an Atlantic framework, to compare the legal history of the Spanish and British empires with one eye on Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui\u2019s work and the other on the papers produced for the volume.\nIf there is a concept central to both Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui\u2019s writings and to \nmany of the essays in this volume, it is the\nderecho indiano \u2013i t sm e a n i n g ,  \nimplications, development, and variability, and the changing ways that scholars have understood it. From the perspective of the English Atlantic, what stands out is the lack of an analogous notion that refers to the collective legal order of the British North American colonies.\n1Section I of this essay \nwill explore why scholars of the English Atlantic do not think in terms of a \nderecho brit\u00e1nico indiano . Its absence has powerfully shaped scholarship on \nthe intellectual history of law (Section II) and on the trajectories of change perceived in the legal development of the two empires (Section III).\nI. Derecho Indiano and the (Missing) British American\nContinental Legal Order\nHistorians of Spanish American law have put the concept of the \u201c derecho \nindiano \u201d at the center of their \ufb01eld. This is true whether they treat the term \nrestrictively as a shorthand for legal doctrines, institutions, and personnel, or whether, more expansively, they include within the term, as Tau does, the \n1 I will focus on the colonies that became the United States. Strictly speaking, the British \nAtlantic would have included English Canada and the English Caribbean.\nSpanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 9values and \u201cspirit\u201d of the law and the interactions with politics and the wider \nsociety that animated the juridical order. The ongoing learned debates over \nthe nature and meaning of the derecho indiano have made the term highly \ncontested, which has only underscored its importance as an object of study. \nIndeed, historians who go so far as to recast the derecho indiano less as a set of \nd o c t r i n e st h a na sa ni n t e l l e c t u a lc u l t u re, and who contend that its successes \nand failures owed less to its institutio nal framework than to the social net-\nworks and political interests surrounding those institutions, nonetheless insist on its centrality as the starting point for discussing Spanish American law. Some of the papers in this conference \u2013 for instance, by Ezequiel Ab\u00e1solo, Luigi Nuzzo, and Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4ki \u2013 represent the third gener-ation of re \ufb02ection on these themes, if we consider Tau and his contempo-\nraries the second generation, and their predecessors such as Ricardo Levene \nand Rafael Altamira the \ufb01rst generation.\n2\nHistorians of British American law, looking upon all of this, are im-\npressed by the sophistication and intensity of these debates. But even more, they are struck by the absence of a workable analogue in their world to the \nderecho indiano . When they discuss the legal orders of the British Atlantic, \nthey think in terms of \u201cconstitutions, \u201d distinguishing among three types. First, a mix of charters, bills of rights, statutes, longstanding institutions, and customs organized, or \u201cconstituted, \u201d power within Great Britain itself. Second, each colony in America developed its own constitution, commonly \nresting on its charter, supplemented by colonial statutes, customs, and habits \nof wielding power. Third, an unstable, disputed \u201cimperial constitution, \u201d built out of conventions accumulating from the latter seventeenth century onward, structured government between Britain and its colonies across \nthe Atlantic. Each colony handled local a ffairs, while the Crown and parlia-\nment oversaw matters of general concern such as war and peace, diplomatic \naffairs, coinage, and intercolonial and foreign commerce. The Empire pro-\nvided a structure for review of colonial legislation by the Crown\u2019s Privy Council and for appeal of judgments by colonial supreme courts. With \ncharacteristic unclarity, the imperial constitution o ffered choice of law rules \nsuggesting when colonies might develop their own particular law, when \nthey might deploy the diverse array of sources contained within the rubric \n2Ab\u00e1solo (2015); N uzzo (2015); P ihlajam\u00e4ki (2015).\n10 R i c h a r dJ .R o s sof the \u201claws of England, \u201d and when English law would override \u201crepugnant\u201d \ncolonial ordinances.3\nConspicuously absent among these three constitutions was a fourth: a \ncollective legal order of the colonies of the English Atlantic, a derecho brit\u00e1-\nnico indiano . Is this concept seldom found in the writings of scholars of \nBritish America because they had no political or ideological reason to invent it? The formation of the notion of a Spanish American\nderecho indiano is \ninstructive here. The concept, developed by Ricardo Levene, came into use among historians only in the middle third of the twentieth century. It allowed scholars to treat the law of the Spanish Indies from a cosmopolitan, pan-Hispanic perspective that escaped from the limitations of national his-toriography. To speak of a\nderecho indiano was to emphasize how the various \nLatin American nations shared a legal-cultural inheritance, an inheritance that their forebears had not merely received from Castile but had helped construct.\n4There was no corresponding need to deploy a legal historical \nconcept to underscore the common heritage of the constituent parts of the United States since it was already a single nation rather than, as in Latin \nAmerica, a grouping of independent countries created out of a once uni \ufb01ed \nempire.\nIdeology and politics aside, the more signi \ufb01cant reason why historians do \nnot think in terms of a\nderecho brit\u00e1nico indiano is that the historical record is \nnot conducive. Suppose, as a thought experiment, we imagine what a hypo-thetical\nderecho brit\u00e1nico indiano would have looked like. Its features can be \nmodeled, by analogy, on the Spanish American derecho indiano. The purpose \nof this thought experiment is not to argue that a derecho brit\u00e1nico indiano\nactually existed in any meaningful sense and has been overlooked. Not until the closing stages of the colonial period do hints of one emerge. Rather, the \npoint is, ultimately, to invite re \ufb02ection on the implications of Spanish Amer-\nican \u2013 but not British American \u2013 legal history being organized around the study of a collective continental legal order.\n3G reene (1987) 67\u201368, 74\u201376; G reene (2011) 49\u201354, 63\u201366.

Cf. T au(1997) 28\u201333, which \ncontends that the work of Garc\u00eda-Gallo more than Levene\u2019s made \u201c derecho indiano \u201dt h e  \ncentral concept for the \ufb01eld.\nSpanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 11Aderecho brit\u00e1nico indiano would have included, \ufb01rst, an array of institu-\ntions that recurred from colony to colony (akin to the audiencias ,cabildos , \ncorregidores , and so forth that could be found in New Spain, Peru, and other \nareas). Second, this collective legal order of the English American colonies \nwould have expressed through law a dominant set of ideological and polit-ical commitments spanning the continent. In the case of the Spanish Empire, these included, for instance, the representation of the king as a \nguarantor of justice to his vassals, a commitment to evangelization, and a \ndisdain for representative assemblies. Third, the collective legal order would have had a branch of law for overseeing a uni \ufb01ed religious establishment. \nFourth, it would have included principles determining which situations w o u l db eg o v e r n e db yi n d i g e n o u sc u s t o m sa n dw h i c hb yf u s i o n so fi n d i g -\nenous and settler law. Fi ftha n d \ufb01nally, a sizable corpus of law issued from \nthe metropolis and governing day to day life in the colonies \u2013 something \nakin to what the Spanish Empire collected in the\nRecopilaci\u00f3n \u2013w o u l dh a v e  \nbrought some unity to an English collective legal order. But in reality, as opposed to in our thought experiment, the di fferent English settlements \ndisagreed in their religious and secular institutions, ideological commit-ments, policies towards native law, and social and economic legislation.\nAs a result, historians sometimes treat the law of each English colony as a \nsingular entity (the law of Massachusetts, of Virginia, and so forth). Or, more commonly, they think in terms of regions, with some dispute about how to \norganize them. A typical division includes New England, the Middle Colo-\nnies or the Delaware Valley, the Chesapeake, the Deep South, and the Car-ibbean islands. To be sure, students of the Spanish American\nderecho indiano\nalso assume regionalism \u2013 but of a di fferent sort. Peripheral settlements, they \nnote, employed varieties of the derecho indiano less learned than the versions \nthat obtained in the cores of New Spain and Peru. The choice of law rules contained within the\nderecho indiano allowed corporations, indigenous com-\nmunities, and viceroys, audiencias, cabildos , and other governing institutions \nto create norms that di ffered from place to place. The geographical variation \nthat was expected, even praised, within the derecho indiano did not call into \nquestion its primacy as the overall framework for Spanish American law.5\n5Altamira (1945) 144\u2013183; C utter (1995) 32\u201343; G onz\u00e1lez (1995) 11\u201367; T au(1992a) \n181\u2013183, 313\u2013319; T au(2001) 53\u201379, 96\u2013100, 151; T au(1997) 85\u201392.\n12 R i c h a r dJ .R o s sBy contrast, the regionalism of British American law was of a more \nprofound character. Seventeenth century settlers came over with widely \nvarying goals, forming colonies at di fferent points in time with distinct \ninstitutional structures and legal cultures. First, where the sixteenth century \nSpanish Empire imposed Castilian-governing institutions upon New Spain and Peru, the English Empire insisted on no comparable similarities among its various colonies.\n6The mode of appointment of senior executive and \njudicial o fficials differed among colonies. The governor and his council \ncommonly nominated judges and subordinate executive o fficials and served \nas an appellate tribunal. The governor and council owed their appointment variously to the king (in \u201croyal\u201d colonies such as Virginia), or to private individuals who \u201cowned\u201d settlements (in \u201cproprietary\u201d colonies such as \nPennsylvania), or to popular election (in \u201ccorporate\u201d colonies such as Con-\nnecticut).\nSecond, institutional and legal cultural variation occurred because the \ninitial settlers who established colonies selected among institutions and legal norms familiar from home, adopting some, reshaping or rejecting others, in \nregionally speci \ufb01c processes. Consider the contrast between Massachusetts \n(the dominant colony in New England) and Virginia (the leading colony in \nthe Chesapeake). Committed Puritans led the settlement of early Massachu-setts. Determined to create a more righteous and Christianized society, they insisted that the state and churches work together in guiding or driving \npeople toward moral regeneration. Church members alone voted in col-\nony-wide elections in order to preserve control by the godly. Yet within the con \ufb01nes of this religious mission, the colony strove for a communal \nand consensual model of authority. Settlers annually elected their o fficials \nand participated widely in local o ffices. Massachusetts codi \ufb01e di t sl a w sa n d  \nprovided decentralized tribunals at the county and town level, dispensing prompt and relatively nontechnical justice. Virginia planters, by contrast, primarily sought material gain rather than social regeneration. Tobacco bar-ons who controlled land and servant labor exercised legal authority as a \nresult of their economic and social prominence. Virginia notables dispensed \na style of justice more authoritarian than the colonial norm in order to govern an agitated population that was disproportionately young and male. \n6Lang (1975) 221\u2013222.\nSpanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 13The primary unit of government was the county rather than the town (as in \nMassachusetts). The colony\u2019s slight inst itutional presence beneath the county \nlevel and its dispersed settlement, heavy-handed elite, and propensity to-wards violence combined to undercut the e ffectiveness of legal decisions. \nT h em o s td i s t i n c t i v ef e a t u r eo fV i r g i n i aa n dt h eo t h e rs o u t h e r na n dC a r i b -bean colonies was the law of slavery. England did not have a law of slavery itself, nor did it create a slave code for its American colonies in the fashion of \nthe French and Spanish empires. Virgi nia and the Southern and Caribbean \ncolonies, but not Massachusetts, developed the distinctive policing apparatus \nthat accompanied slave law. Masters, for example, enjoyed legal protection if they accidentally beat slaves to death; colonies o ffered public support for the \nprivate recapture or killing of runaways; and restrictions were placed on the \nability of whites and slaves to socialize and trade with each other.\n7\nSpace restrictions preclude comparing other regions in seventeenth cen-\ntury English America. But the contrast of Massachusetts and Virginia suggest \na conclusion: The profound regionalism of British America appears far less as a set of variations within a shared legal order than does Spanish American \nregionalism, which grew up under the framework of the\nderecho indiano .T h e  \nabsence of a derecho brit\u00e1nico indiano has shaped how scholars have pursued \nthe legal history of the two empires. This is apparent in the study of the \nintellectual history of law.\nII. Intellectual History\nOn occasion similar questions have driven the intellectual history of British and Spanish American law. Historians have explored both empires\u2019 justi \ufb01-\ncations for colonization and dispossession of indigenous peoples. And they have stressed the prominence of law as a political vocabulary for negotiating with imperial administrators. Yet for all this, signi \ufb01cant differences stand out \nin how scholars have pursued the intellectual history of law in the two empires. First, in the mix of approaches to legal history, intellectual history \noccupies a more prominent place in Spanish American than in British Amer-\nican historiography. This is, in part, the result of the much greater amount of intellectual \u201craw material\u201d in Spanish America. Since so many key admin-istrators of the Empire were\nletrados ,t h e yl eftbehind much more high-level \n7Konig (2008); N elson (2008) 3\u201379; T omlins (2010) 221\u2013226, 267.\n14 R i c h a r dJ .R o s sintellectual re \ufb02ection on law than did their British counterparts, who were \ntypically laymen. There was no counterpart in the British Empire to the great \nimportance of neo-Thomist legal theory among churchmen and jurists, \nwhich inspired re \ufb02ection on the intersection of eternal law, natural law, \nand positive law in both state and church . British Protestants, lacking orac-\nular confession, did not produce manuals for confessors. Confessor manuals undertook a sustained engagement with law by asking which ordinances \nbound conscience (as per Romans 13:5), and determining whether violation \nof laws binding conscience subjected the o ffender to mortal sin or only to \nvenial sin. Scholars seeking to write intellectual histories of Spanish Amer-ican law have much more to work with than British American historians.\nThe absence of a\nderecho brit\u00e1nico indiano helps account for a second \ndifference. Intellectual histories of British American law, particularly in \nthe seventeenth century, organize themselves regionally to such an extent as to downplay commonalities among the various settlements. By contrast, the more plentiful intellectual histor ies of Spanish American law typically \ntreat the New World as a unit harboring variations rather than as a series of \nlightly connected regions. In support of this proposition, consider some of \nthe distinguished intellectual histories of Spanish American law produced by Tau and by participants in this volume. First, Tau has famously written on t h et r a n s i t i o ni nt h eS p a n i s hA m e r i c a nE m p i r ef r o map r e d o m i n a n t l yc a s u -istical style of legal reasoning towards one that is more reliant on system-\nization.\n8Brian Owensby\u2019s essay extends Tau\u2019s framework by exploring the \ntreatment in Spanish American legal culture of conscience, simultaneously \nthe means and end of casuistry.9Second, Tau and others have stressed the \nimportance of natural law and the \u201ccommon good\u201d within Spanish Amer-\nican legal reasoning. This work has several variants. \u201cCommon good\u201d and \nnatural law might be treated as a touchstone for assessing whether positive laws and customs are valid or not and whether o fficials might suspend \nordinances by invoking the formula \u201c\nobedezco pero no cumplo \u201d[ \u201c Io b e y ,b u t  \ndo not comply\u201d].10Or one might argue that for all the legalistic rhetoric of \nthe Spanish Empire, o fficials based their actions far more on natural law, \nreligious injunctions, and amorphous, self-interested notions of the com-\n8Tau(1992b).\n9O wensby (2015).\n10 T au(2002); T au(1992a) 59\u2013126; T au(2001) 143.\nSpanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 15m o ng o o dt h a no nt h er e q u i r e m e n t so fp o s i t i v el a w .11Or the common good \nand natural law might be taken as the measure of the respective obligations \nof the Crown, offi cials, and vassals in a just social order. From this perspec-\ntive, the identi \ufb01c a t i o no ft h ec o m m o ng o o da n dn a t u r a ll a ww o u l db et h e  \nkey to resolving disputes in areas as diverse as amparo petitions, land compo-\nsiciones , citizenship [ vecindad ], and Indian labor and tribute requirements.12\nHistorians pursuing each of these topics have mixed evidence from New Spain, Peru, the Yucatan, and other regions. In so doing, they adopted a \ncontinental perspective.\nIn contrast to Spanish American historiography, the legal-intellectual his-\ntory of British American casuistry and conscience, common good, and nat-ural law commonly follows regional lines from settlement through, roughly, \nt h em i d d l et h i r do ft h ee i g h t e e n t hc e n t u r y .T ob es u r e ,t h eb r o a d e s to u t l i n e s  \nof these intellectual frameworks were similar in the various regions of the English Atlantic. But in the mid-level propositions, in the ways that settlers drew upon and applied these overall frameworks, the regions di ffered. Let \nus begin with the notion of the \u201ccommon good. \u201d Jacobean promoters of \nVirginia promised \u201chonor and glory\u201d t o settlers who pursued the common \ngood of the new colony rather than their own self-interest.\n13Massachusetts\u2019 \nleaders emphasized the honor of God rather than personal glory, producing \nad ifferently in \ufb02ected notion of the common good, one linked to the reli-\ngious mission of the colony. Both Massachusetts and Virginia settlers \nthought about the common good in the Ciceronian idiom characteristic \nof early modern Europe, which implored citizens to identify their private good with the collective, shared good of their community. This framework recognized that since communities varied, so would the particular form of \nthe common good that each pursued.\n14The common good de \ufb01ned by the \nleaders of Puritan Massachusetts would naturally diff er from that of slave-\nholding Virginia, from Quaker Pennsylvania, and from heterogeneous New \nYork with its substantial Dutch population.\nUnderstandings of conscience and casuistry likewise varied regionally. \nNew England Puritans, Rhode Islander dissidents inspired by Roger Wil-\n11 See, e. g., Herzog (2004); H erzog (1995).\n12 H erzog (2015); H erzog (2003); O wensby (2008); D eSol\u00f3rzano Pereira (1996) 206\u2013275 \n(Indian labor requirements).\n13 F itzmaurice (2003) 77.\n14 M iller (1994) 2\u20133, 21\u201387.\n16 R i c h a r dJ .R o s sliams, and Pennsylvania Quakers, far more than settlers in the slaveholding \nsouth, made conscience a central category of their political life and legal \nculture and studied casuistical (or \u201ccases of conscience\u201d) literature. Histor-\nians consequently either organize studies of early American conscience and c a s u i s t r yb yc o l o n yo rm a k es u r et oe l u c i d a t et h ed i fferences among the \nsettlements.\n15Along with Connecticut and New Haven colonies, but dis-\ntinct from settlements outside of New England, Massachusetts drew on the \njudicial law of Moses to establish the obligations of conscience.16Massachu-\nsetts\u2019 ministers and magistrates used casuistical reasoning to reconcile the \ngodly mission of their colony with the practical exigencies of reason of state, including the need to maintain religious unity. They held that the state might coerce dissenters from Puritan fundamentals on the grounds that \nthese wayward settlers had sinned against their own conscience. Roger Wil-\nliams, exiled out of Massachusetts to help found Rhode Island, famously drew the opposite conclusion and denied the right of the civil magistrates to pressure Christian believers whose conscience led them to minority views. William Penn, the organizer of Pennsylvania, synthesized the leading argu-\nments for religious liberty of conscience circulating in mid-seventeenth cen-\ntury England and adjusted them for a colonial context \u2013 believing, for example, that tolerance would encourage responsible people to immigrate to his colony and would reduce the factionalism epidemic in new settle-ments.\n17The regional rather than continental nature of the legal-intellectual \nhistory of the British Empire before the middle third of the eighteenth century is a subset of \u2013 and further proof of \u2013 the absence of a common legal order, of a\nderecho brit\u00e1nico indiano .\nBut by the mid-eighteenth century, pronounced regional variations be-\ngan to abate. Consider natural law. The law of nature supplied arguments deployed across the di fferent colonies to justify English sovereignty over \nNorth America and the rules for dispossessing native Americans.\n18Regional \nvariation occurred when leaders of the various colonies drew on natural law \n15 For examples of the former, see Mosse (1957) [Massachusetts]; M organ (1967) 130\u2013142 \n[Rhode Island]; G austad (1991) [Rhode Island]; D unn (1967) [Pennsylvania]. For an \nexample of the latter, see, e. g., M urphy (2001).\n16 On which, see R oss(2012).\n17 M osse (1957) 88\u2013106, 132\u2013145; M urphy (2001) 48\u201355, 58\u201360, 173\u2013181.\n18 F itzmaurice (2003) 137\u2013149, 158; P agden (1995); T omlins (2010) 93\u2013132; Y irush (2011) \n12\u201313.\nSpanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 17to discern the obligations of conscience or to de\ufb01ne the common good in \ntheir differing communities.19B yt h em i d d l et h i r do ft h ee i g h t e e n t hc e n t u r y ,  \nthese uses subsided while settlers resisting an intrusive British Empire increasingly drew on natural law as a resource against the Crown and impe-rial administrators. Colonists claimed that their natural right to migrate to America, enter upon its unimproved open lands, and form political societies implied a further right to dispossess natives beyond what the Crown would \nallow and to claim the full protection of English common law against royal \nand proprietary e fforts to limit its applicability. In the decade of agitation \nleading to the American Revolution, controversialists included natural law among their arsenal of arguments.\n20From the mid-eighteenth century \nonward, then, variations in the use and interpretation of natural law tracked \nmore onto political factions (prerogative vs. popular parties and Whig vs. \nTory) than onto regions, as was the case in the seventeenth century. There was, in short, at least a partial convergence among regions in their treatment of natural law. This convergence encouraged scholars to write legal-intellec-tual histories of the Revolutionary era less in regional frameworks than on a \ncontinental-wide scale (in the style of Spanish American legal-intellectual \nhistoriography). With this in mind, we might ask whether the term \u201ccon-vergence\u201d meaningfully describes the overall direction of change in other aspects of British American legal culture, and in Spanish American law.\nIII. Trajectories of Change in Spanish and British American Law\nThe initially regional organization of the British American legal systems \npowerfully shapes the story that scholars tell about the transition of colonial \nlaw from the seventeenth to eighteenth century. The perceived trajectory of \nchange diff ers signi \ufb01cantly from that in Spanish America. Let us start with \nthe latter. Historians of Spanish American law speak of how a framework established by roughly the 1570s underwent a long, gradual period of stabi-lization, maturation, or consolidation until, arguably, the 1750s. The\nderecho \nindiano in the center of this picture underwent, it is said, continual but \nincremental change. Tau\u2019s history of the relative shi ftfrom casuistical to \n19 Adding to the complexity, minority ethnic groups such as the Germans cultivated di ffer-\nently in \ufb02ected understandings of natural law. See R oeber (2001).\n20 B otein (1980); W right (1931) 13\u201399; Y irush (2011) 17, 138, 156, 223\u2013258.\n18 R i c h a r dJ .R o s ssystematic reasoning might be read in this vein. So, too, accounts of the \ngreater professionalization of Spanish American law, with the multiplication \nof letrados as judges or as \u201cjudicial advisors. \u201d21\nThe dominant narratives of change deployed by British American legal \nhistorians are more dynamic in that they feature a rupture, or a signi \ufb01cant \nreorientation, of the colonial legal systems between the seventeenth and \neighteenth centuries. The most important of these stories is \u201canglicization. \u201d \nThis development has two parts. The \ufb01rst concerns an alteration in dispute \nresolution and the character of litigation. Few trained lawyers immigrated to \nseventeenth century America. The colonial court systems were overwhelm-ingly staffed not by legal professionals but by laymen who administered \nnontechnical, arbitral, and discretiona ry justice and brushed aside inconven-\nient ordinances. Magistrates selected more for their social prominence than their legal competence praised fairness and looked down on legal \u201cniceties. \u201d Settlers concentrated on the substance of disputes and dispensed with the intricacies of English legal procedure, with its complicated rules of pleading and obscure terms of art. Community leaders commonly valued arbitration \nover litigation. By the late seventeenth century, important elements of this \ninherited system were under stress. The rate of litigation increased faster than population in the eighteenth century. Where neighbors might arbitrate dis-agreements in order to restore peace in a face-to-face community, population growth and dispersion and the expansion of long-distance trade and credit \nnetworks meant that more disputes arose among strangers \u201cat arm\u2019s length\u201d \ndetermined to prevail at trial even at the cost of fracturing relationships. Commercialization, especially trans-Atlantic trade, created pressures for a more predictable, more lawyerly and formal legal system, one more attentive \nto English precedents and procedures. As tribunals increasingly respected \nrather than recoiled from legal technicality, litigants found it in their interest to hire lawyers who dissected pleadings and sought delays and reviews. This further undermined the simplicity and accessibility of colonial justice. The colonial legal system became more like England\u2019s, became more \u201canglicized, \u201d \nas it moved from a \u201ccommunal, informal mode of resolving disputes to a \nrationalized, lawyerly, \u201d technical mode.\n22\n21 B ravo Lira(1989) 11\u201337; H aring (1963) 69\u201370; M uro Orej\u00f3n(1970); T au(1992b); \nZorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa( 1 9 9 4 )4 1 6 .\n22 B otein (1981); D ayton (1995); D ayton (1993) 10 [quote in D ayton (1995)]; H offer\n(1998) 76\u201385, 93\u201397; M ann (1987); M urrin (1983); R osen (1992). Although these inter-\nSpanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 19The British colonies \u201canglicized\u201d in a second way in that their intensely \nregional legal cultures lost some of their distinctiveness and converged \ntowards the legal order of England. The Puritan commitments of New \nEngland, the Quaker experiment in Pennsylvania, the Dutch heritage and the Stuart monarchs\u2019 absolutist initiatives in New York, and the Catholic presence in Maryland faded in the eighteenth century, losing their seven-teenth century salience. Although marked economic, social and demo-\ngraphic di fferences continued to divide the regions of eighteenth century \nBritish North America, increasing imperial oversight of colonial lawmaking \nand judicature reduced the distinctiveness of regional legal orders. The king\u2019s Privy Council began taking appeals from colonial courts and vetting legis-lation. Britain appointed English barristers as judges on supreme tribunals \nand introduced customs inspectors, admiralty judges, and other imperial \nadministrators into the colonies. Through these mechanisms the Empire recon \ufb01gured colonial judiciaries along mor e uniform and hierarchical lines, \neliminated the appellate jurisdiction of Assemblies, and suppressed practices that were too puritan, Quaker or Dutch or that interfered with imperial \ncontrol of trade and the royal prerogati ve. This partial convergence of region-\nal legal orders was part of a larger North American anglicization noticeable \nin the formation of a deeper, more self-conscious British identity and the growing resemblance of elite culture and values, military structures, and consumption patterns across the colonies and the metropolis.\n23\nComparing the dynamic transformations captured by the rubric of \u201cangli-\ncization\u201d to the incremental changes of the derecho indiano in the mature \nSpanish American Empire suggests two (somewhat speculative) hypotheses \u2013 one brief, and one more extensive. To begin with, might we suppose that the \neighteenth-century British colonies not only converged towards each other \nand towards England but also towards the Spanish Empire by developing certain features of a collective legal order, this hitherto missing analogue to \nrelated processes have been taken as evidence of the \u201canglicization\u201d of colonial law, im-\nportant elements of them have also been organized under other rubrics, such as legal \n\u201cmodernization. \u201d On the latter, see the debate between P riest (2001), and M ann (2002), \nand Priest\u2019s reply, ibid., 1881\u20131887.\n23 B otein (1983) 50\u201367; B reen (1984) 221\u2013223; B reen (1986); G reene (1988) 170\u2013177; \nMurrin (1966). To be sure, regional legal orders only partially converged. On the impor-\ntance of communications patterns in preserving some measure of diversity among the colonies\u2019 legal orders, see R oss(2008).\n20 R i c h a r dJ .R o s sthederecho indiano ? In eighteenth century British America, institutional \nforms grew more similar among the regions; the Empire articulated more \nelaborate choice of law rules for meshing metropolitan legal norms with \nsettler norms, backed up by a more intrusive imperial review of legislation and adjudication and provision for appeals to a crown council; and \ufb01nally, \nBritain engaged in more direct regulation of colonial society through parlia-mentary legislation, gubernatorial instructions, and crown-controlled tribu-\nnals such as vice-admiralty courts. These developments are reminiscent of \nanalogous features in the\nderecho indiano . Perhaps some measure of conver-\ngence between the Spanish and British empires occurred in the eighteenth century as elements of a collective legal order emerged that were absent or muted in the regionally distinctive seventeenth century English colonies \nliving under a lax empire. Although no\nderecho brit\u00e1nico indiano existed on \nthe eve of the American Revolution, were there intimations of one?24\nI will develop my second (speculative) hypothesis at greater length. British \nAmerican anglicization is about the reorientation of a legal order on account \nof powerful social forces: population growth and dispersal, greater partici-\npation in transatlantic trade, and a newly intrusive English Empire. Was \nthere an analogy in the Spanish Empire \u2013 a story about the recreation of a legal order under the pressure of profound demographic, political, and economic change? In search of this story, we should look not at the settler side of the\nderecho indiano (which featured consolidation and incremental \nchange), but at the Indian side. The Spanish Empire famously used law and bureaucracy to regulate the lives of indigenous peoples \u2013 to calibrate their tribute and labor requirements, to gath er together dispersed Indians through \ncongregaciones , and to develop semi-autonomous governance under Spanish \noversight in the republic of the Indios . Within this general framework, there \nwere speci \ufb01c ways in which the changing relationship of the derecho indiano\n24 What I am suggesting is related to, but ultimately di fferent than, the convergence of the \npolitical cultures of the two empires in the late seventeenth century and early eighteenth \ncentury observed by historians. Venality and creolization of o fficeholding in Spanish \nAmerica granted settlers a larger degree of self-rule. Meanwhile, the pressures of a more intrusive British Empire encouraged English settlers to learn how to lobby and manipu-late an imperial bureaucracy. As a result, the di fferences in British and Spanish American \npolitical culture narrowed. Elliott (2006) 378\u2013379. By contrast, I have sketched out \u2013 \nreally, speculated about \u2013 a (partial) convergence in the legal orders of the two empires.\nSpanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other\n21to indigenous peoples between the mid-sixteenth and mid-eighteenth cen-\ntury brings to mind elements of the anglicization story.\nFirst,\u201canglicization\u201d refers to the transformation of litigation in the North \nAmerican colonies, a move towards a more technical, lawyerly, and formal system, one more responsive to English precedents and procedures. Indige-nous communities in Spanish America underwent a (partial) Hispaniciza-tion in how they handled disputes. As is well known, natives became adept \nat using Spanish legal tools, from petitions and lawsuits to appeals and \namparos , in order to protect communal lands, participate in newly formed \nprivate land markets, reduce tribute and labor exactions, defend against the \noverreaching of o fficials, and mediate political con \ufb02icts.25As Indians grew \nmore knowledgeable about Spanish law, they began to import into their \nlegal affairs and governance of their own communities Spanish procedures \nand concepts learned in con \ufb02icts with settlers and imperial offi cials. One sees \nthis in land records used within Nahua communities, in con \ufb02icts among \nethnic groups and Andean ayllus , and in disputes about succession to major \nchieftainships. Native commoners appealed to Spanish legal concepts and \ntribunals when \ufb01ghting to reduce duties owed to Indian notables. Indige-\nnous governadores and alcaldes mixed native usages with Spanish legalisms \nwhen they judged other Indians or conducted residencias for Indian o ffi-\ncials.26By the end of the seventeenth century, lawyers needed to do less \ntranslating of the accounts of indigenous complainants and witnesses into Spanish legal categories as natives became more familiar with legalistic ter-\nminology.\n27To look at these developments comparatively is to notice that \nindigenous internalization of Spanish legal procedures and concepts, what Tau provocatively calls \u201c\nmestizaje jur\u00eddico , \u201d resembles anglicization in certain \nrespects.28For anglicization likewise involved both an external dimension \n(the deployment of English legal technicalities by settlers disputing with imperial o fficials) and an internal dimension (the refashioning of settlers\u2019 \nlegal culture as they became habituated to more lawyerly and formal English legal procedures and concepts).\n25 K ellogg (1995) 13, 51; O wensby (2008) 20, 41\u201344, 88\u201389, 95\u2013100, 127\u2013128, 137\u2013140, \n157, 295\u201393; S tern (1993) 116\u2013119.\n26 G ibson (1964) 180\u2013181; L ockhart (1992) 166\u2013167; S tern (1993) 132\u2013134.\n27 K ellogg (1995) 13, 82.\n28 T au(1997) 102.\n22 R i c h a r dJ .R o s sSecond, anglicization alludes to a more \u201cEnglish\u201d style of governance in \nthe colonies. This involved the creation of more hierarchical judiciaries, the \nelimination of Assembly appellate jurisdiction, and the displacement of \nsome measure of Creole control by the appointment of customs inspectors, vice-admiralty judges, and English barristers in the colonial supreme courts. By the latter seventeenth century, the Crown not only began accepting appeals from colonial supreme courts, but demanded that statutes be sent \nfor vetting, which could lead to editing or abrogation. The Board of Trade \nsent questionnaires to the colonies asking about their laws and customs, a proactive way of beginning the process of inspection. As Spanish American h i s t o r i a n sh a v ed e t a i l e d ,o v e rt i m eC a s t i l ep r e s s e df o ram o r ei n t r u s i v eg o v -ernance of indigenous communities. This occurred in stages. From the mid-\nsixteenth century onward, the Empire drew on models of Spanish municipal \ngovernment to impose\ncabildos with alcaldes and regidores on native com-\nmunity units.29The imperial bureaucracy from the local corregidor through \nthe Council of the Indies scrutinized indigenous customs and bylaws, reserv-ing the right to eliminate native usages that violated natural law, reason, or \nChristian doctrine. The Empire\u2019s screening process did only extend to usages \nbrought before its tribunals. Crown o fficials interviewed Indian elders and \nconducted ethnographic and historical surveys in order to determine \u2013 and begin the triage of \u2013 native customs.\n30By the latter eighteenth century, in \nsome parts of Spanish America, newly appointed local o fficials answerable to \nthe Crown intervened more extensively into Indian a ffairs within native \ncommunities. Subdelegates and jueces espa\u00f1oles inserted among the Yucatan \nMayans increasingly adjudicated intra-Indian disputes that previously would have been handled by native leaders.\n31Viewing these developments with an \neye on the anglicization of British North American colonial governance reveals some intriguing similarities. In both cases, one sees the (partial) reordering of governing structures along metropolitan lines; a modest shi ft \nfrom indirect to direct rule through the appointment of o fficials more \nresponsive to imperial priorities than to local audiences; and the vetting of \n29 G ibson (1964) 166\u2013181; H orn (1997) 44\u201385; L ockhart (1992) 28\u201358.\n30 B orah (1983) 43; T au(2001) 134\u2013143.\n31 F arriss (1984) 355\u2013366. In other areas, such as New Spain, the Bourbon reforms do not \nappear to have made much di fference in the governance of Indian communities. G ibson\n(1966) 173.\nSpanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 23locally generated customs and bylaws, both reactively (as a byproduct of \nlitigation and appeals) and proactively (through crown-initiated surveys \nand questionnaires).\nThird and \ufb01nally, anglicization refers to the fading distinctiveness of the \nlegal cultures in the English colonie s and the convergence of those legal \ncultures toward each other and toward England. The strictures of the derecho \nindiano likewise pushed for a (partial) convergence of the distinct indigenous \nlegal cultures among the Nahuas, the Yucatan Mayas, and the Andean peo-\nples. Over the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the wide variety of insti-tutional forms that had previously obtained among indigenous towns and villages in Mexico, the Yucatan, and the Andes were subordinated as the Spanish imposed upon native communities throughout the Americas an \nadministrative structure modeled on Castilian municipal government: the \ncabildo with its alcaldes ,regidores, escrivanos ,a n do t h e rm i n o ro fficials. Like \ntheir Spanish counterparts, Indian offi cers in all of these regions came to \nenjoy legal authority \u2013 as a formal matter \u2013 because of their connection to \nthe king rather than by hereditary succession. Indian hierarchical chains of \ncommand reaching downward from the provincial level withered away.32As \nindigenous governance withdrew from provincial networks to concentrate \nin cabildos with structural similarities throughout the Americas, as Indian officials traced the source of their power back to the Crown, as native \njudicature and administration increasingly incorporated Spanish legal con-\ncepts and looked upwards to imperial tribunals and councils for appeals and \nredress of grievances, then the legal cultures of Nahua, Yucatan, and Andean communities began to look more like each other, and somewhat more like Castile, than they had at the time of conquest. At least to some extent, they \nc o n v e r g e d .L e tm eb ec l e a ra b o u tw h a tIa mn o ts a y i n g :t h a ti n d i g e n o u s  \ncommunities and the colonies of British North America were socially or legally similar. Instead, more modestly, I claim that there were suggestive parallels in their direction of movement \u2013 in the \u201cconvergence\u201d that each underwent and in the transformations they experienced in dispute resolu-\ntion and governance structures.

With some exceptions, which will be mentioned through-out this paper, the period between the conquest and independence of Span-ish America is described as \u201ccolonial\u201d and, thus, included in the long-term history of the phenomenon of colonialism in the world.\n1Within this com-\nmon framework, there are di fferent interpretations of the nature of this \ncolonial relationship, its degree of continuity with 19th-Century colonial experiences, or the relatively typical character of colonial societies in the Americas between the 16th and 18th Centuries. This is not the place to reconstruct the genealogy of this interpr etation of colonial Spanish America, \neven though there is no doubt about the role that post-colonial discourse has had and continues to have in its consolidation.\n2In post-colonial discourse, \nthe colonial nature is a heuristic tool in the hands of historians, a starting point for a historical study ultimately conceived as the deconstruction of discourses that mask and reproduce dynamics of power and control between \nEuropean powers and colonized countries.\n3\nThe starting point in this paper is di fferent. The colonial nature of the \nrelationship between the so-called West Indies and the Crown of Castile is \nthe subject of study, rather than an assumption. Our purpose is to try to \noffer, from legal history, a new reading of Spanish colonialism that could \nlead to a more accurate interpretation of Latin American history. To this \nend, it is worth re \ufb02ecting on the historiographical categories we are using \nto de \ufb01ne the \u201cpolitical\u201d status of American territories under the Spanish \n1 A typical example of the assumption of this \u201ccolonial paradigm\u201d is the title of the well-\ndocumented work by W oseber (2003). The author does not explain why she uses the \nphrase \u201cColonial Domination\u201d as the title for her work. Its appropriateness is taken for \ngranted.\n2 For the formation of post-colonialism and its di fferent projections, see Y oung (2001).\n3 In this sense the question is revisited.

From Las Indias no eran Colonias [The Indies were not Colonies]\nto the Livre noir du colonialisme [The Black Book of Colonialism]\n1. Levene\u2019s proposal: Las Indias no eran Colonias\nSixty years have elapsed since Ricardo Levene contested the treatment of \ncolonies which historiography gave \u2013 and continues to give \u2013 to the Spanish dominions in the Americas during the Modern Age.\n4The publication of the \nArgentine historian\u2019s theses, condensed into the title of his work Las Indias \nno eran Colonias , gave end to a series of actions promoted by Levene that \nw e r ef a v o r a b l yr e c e i v e db yt h eA r g e n t i n eN a t i o n a lA c a d e m yo fH i s t o r yf o r  the\ufb01rst time in 1948. Their aim was to replace the term \u201ccolonial\u201d with \nother terms that evidence the full integration of Spanish America into the Spanish Monarchy as \u201cprovinces, kingdo ms, dominions, republics (the latter \nterm, in the etymological sense). \u201d\n5Levene's work addressed the problem \n4Levene (1951).\n5Levene (1951) 10. On 2 October 1948, the Argentine National Academy of History de-\nbated the proposal put forward by its president whereby he \u201csuggested that the authors of \nworks of research, abstracts or texts on history of the Americas and of Argentina, substi-\ntute the expression \u2018colonial period\u2019 for \u2018period of Spanish rule and civilization,\u2019\u201d among others. Finally, the proposal was accepted, with Ravignani\u2019s dissenting opinion, although \nthe expression \u2018Hispanic period\u2019 was favored to the one originally put forward. The min-\nutes are transcribed at the end of L evene (1951) 153\u2013156.\n30 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezfrom a strong legal positivist perspective. In his argument, the Argentine \nhistorian attached special signi \ufb01cance to the laws promulgated by Castilian \nMonarchs, in particular to the Recopilaci\u00f3n de Leyes de Indias [Compilation of \nthe Law of the Indies].6\nThese Argentine pronouncements were echoed in Spain immediately.7\nIn 1949, the First Hispanic-American Conference on History agreed to name the colonial period \u201cperiod of Spanish rule. \u201d In 1954, the\nInstituto Gonzalo \nFern \u00e1ndez de Oviedo, a ffiliated to the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones \nCient\u00ed\ufb01 cas[Higher Council for Scienti \ufb01c Research], organized two work \nsessions for its members to discuss the issue. The conclusions they reached were somewhat more nuanced than those approved by the Argentine Acad-emy, but both institutions strongly concurred in matters of substance. \nAccording to the Institute, the terms used by the Law of the Indies and \nby \u201cSpanish Constitutional law\u201d to refer to the Spanish American territories had been \u201ckingdoms, \u201d \u201cdomains\u201d or \u201cprovinces, \u201d equating them to peninsu-\n6 Summarizing the arguments that he would develop throughout the book, Levene stated \nin the preliminary chapter that \u201cThe Indies were not colonies, according to express legal \nprovisions, because they were incorporated into the Crown of Castile and Leon, accord-\ning to Ponti \ufb01cal concession and to the inspirations of the Catholic Monarchs, and they \ncould not be disposed of; because their natives were on a legal par with European Span-iards and the legitimacy of marriage between them was consecrated; because the descend-\nants of European or Creole Spaniards, and in general the worthy of the Indies, had \npreferential allocation of o ffices; because the Councils of Castile and of the Indies shared \nthe same high political powers; because the provincial or regional institutions of the \nIndies exercised legislative authority; because the kingdoms of Castile and Leon and of \nthe Indies belonged to one Crown, and their laws and order of Government had to be as \nsimilar as possible; because in all the cases where it was not decided what the laws of the \nIndies should provide for, those of Castile would be observed according to the order of \nprecedence of the\nLeyes de Toro [Laws of Toro]; because, \ufb01nally, the term conquest as \nsource of law was removed, and it was replaced by the terms population and paci \ufb01ca-\ntion. \u201d L evene (1951) 10\u201311.\n7 It should be remembered, however, that in 1946 legal historian Alfonso Garc\u00eda Gallo had \npublished a lecture on \u201cThe political constitution of the Spanish Indies, \u201d where he stated that legally the Indies constituted a \u201cpolitical entity with independent personality. \u201d Yet, \nthis did not mean denying their special bond with Castile to the extent that such close \nbond \u2013 as Garc\u00eda Gallo pointed out \u2013 \u201csometimes becomes a true merger and the title of \nKingdoms of the Indies has only an honori \ufb01c value, such as that of the Kingdoms of \nLe\u00f3n, Toledo, Granada, etc., merged into the Crown of Castile. \u201d In addition, he rejected \nthe term colonies to refer to the Indies, recalling that the laws referred to them as king-\ndoms, provinces or, in the 18th Century, domains. G arc\u00eda Gallo (1946) 16\u201317.\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy\n31lar terms. Therefore, expressions such as \u201ccolonialism, \u201d \u201ccolonialist, \u201d \u201ccolo-\nnist\u201d and \u201ccoloniage, \u201d deemed harmful to the dignity of those peoples, could \nnot be used to refer to the relationships between both worlds. There was no \nsuch problem, however, with the terms \u201cc olony, \u201d \u201ccolonization, \u201d \u201ccolonizer\u201d \nand \u201ccolonial, \u201d as long as they were used in their technical sense.8In this \nregard, the Institute was adamant to clearly state the diff erences between the \nSpanish colonization and modern colonialism, which is why it stated that, \nsince the latter had \u201cdistorted the pristine meaning\u201d of the above-mentioned \nterms \u201ccolony\u201d or \u201ccolonization, \u201d they should be used where it was not possible to employ other expressions conveying more limited meaning, such as \u201cperiod of Spanish rule, \u201d \u201cSpanish period, \u201d \u201cHispanic, \u201d \u201cViceregal, \u201d \u201cPre-Viceregal, \u201d \u201cProto-Viceregal\u201d periods, etc. Finally, considering the overall \npicture of colonization, the Institute stressed the need to highlight the Span-\nish one due to \u201cthe high spiritual and human values that characterized it. \u201d\n9\nIt is inappropriate to provide here a detailed description of the \ufb01rst \nmoment of historiographical discussion brought about by Levene\u2019s initiative and its continuation until the mid-1970s, since this has already been duly \nreconstructed by Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui.\n10However, it is relevant to highlight the \n8 As stated in the minutes of the sessions, designating the Spanish American territories as \nkingdoms, provinces or domains in the legal sources did not entail any obstacle for the \nInstitute \u201cto place the Spanish action in the Indies within the multiple colonization pro-\ncesses that have taken place throughout the history of mankind, though, as stated above, valuing its uniqueness, and not diminishing the greatness of the \u2018Spanish colonization\u2019 \nperiod for receiving such designation nor considering it harmful for those States that owe \nthe base of their current existence as nations to the referred period. \u201d Acerca del t\u00e9rmino \n\u201ccolonia\u201d (1954) 176.\n9 Acerca del t\u00e9rmino \u201ccolonia\u201d (1954) 180. The conclusions of the \ufb01rst session included the \nassertion that Spain had conducted \u201ca colonization process\u201d in the Americas but it had \n\u201cnot subjected the Spanish American regions under its rule to a regime of exploitation; rather, it gave them a legal personality, and in such legal order the absence of the term \ncolony is evident. \u201d Ibid., 159.\n10 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 80\u201392. As stated by Tau, there was active participation in the \ndebate by the most prominent specialists of the time \u2013 with di fferent political views \u2013, \nsuch as Ots Capdequ\u00ed, Rafael Altamira, Alfonso Garc\u00eda Gallo, Mario G\u00f3ngora, Richard Konetzke or Demetrio Ramos. Even though there was general consensus with the theses \nsupported by the Argentine Academy, there were also dissenting voices. Altamira believed it was correct to speak of colonies, in the classical sense of the term, as a result of the \naction of populating, even if the territories were denominated provinces, dominions or \nkingdoms. Ots shared Levene\u2019s proposals, although he rejected equality between Peninsu-\n32 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezterms in which the debate was held as well as its ideological background \nbecause, despite the time elapsed since then, some of these features still \ndescribe the treatment of this issue.\nThe debate about whether it was appropriate to use the word \u201ccolony\u201d \nwas not understood then in purely nominal terms. Implicitly, and some-\ntimes also explicitly, for many participants the subject of debate was not so much the place occupied by the Spanish American territories under the \nSpanish Monarchy but the role played by \u201cSpain\u201d in the Americas. The result \nof such dispute, which seems related to the one involving other actors in the 18th Century,\n11appeared fraught with political consequences on both sides \nof the Atlantic. What was at stake in Argentina and in other countries in the Americas was the prominent role that the Hispanic world should play in \nde\ufb01ning the Nations in the Americas. Levene recognized this clearly in the \npreface to his work of 1951 by stating that the \u201chistory of the Americas \nbegins with that of Spain, our spiritual ascent and whose roots connect us with the remote origins of civilization. \u201d\n12In this regard, the Argentine his-\ntorian not only excluded from such historical past indigenous cultures, alien \nto that historical context through which the Americas connected with \u201cciv-\nilization\u201d (which could only be European), but also linked the debate about the nature of colonial Spanish domination directly to their present, because ultimately the Americas had their spiritual origin and roots in Spain.\nTherefore, it was not a terminological problem. The attempt to remove \nthe term \u201ccolonies\u201d from historical vocabulary did not respond to mere academic reasons. In the words of Levene himself, \u201cIt is not a mere question of logomachy or discussion where attention is focused solely on the word rather than on the issue itself. [\u2026]. It is about providing evidence, as it is \ndone in this book of historical synthesis, of the legal and political values of \nSpanish rule \u2013 surely not viewed through the glow of the red legend rather \nlar and Spanish American inhabitants, without this implying any present political state-\nments. According to Mario G\u00f3ngora, it was right to use the term colonial when one \nmeant transferring a population nucleus to another territory. However, the relevance of \nits economic sense required further research. Ibid.\n11 It is no coincidence that the \u201ccolonial issue\u201d was raised precisely in the 18th Century, in \nan intellectual context marked by European Enlightenment conceptions of Spanish Amer-ica and their Creole response. See G erbi (1973); and C a\u00f1izares -Esguerra (2001).\n12 L evene (1951) 9.\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy\n33than the black one \u2013, values that provide the foundation for the thesis that \nt h eI n d i e sw e r en o tc o l o n i e s . \u201d13\nIn Spain, the debate was also framed in terms of approval or condemna-\ntion of the work done in the Americas. Those were the early years of the Francoist State. The political context favored a nationalist reading of the history of the conquest and incorporation of the Indies into the Spanish Monarchy.\n14However, this did not lead \u2013 as we have seen \u2013 to the outright \ncondemnation of the term \u201ccolony. \u201d From an analysis of the di fferent mean-\nings that the term had received throughout history, it seemed reasonable to conclude that it could be used to designate the Spanish American territories provided it was not used pejoratively, i. e., identifying it with the mere economic exploitation of the New World.\n15Hence, it can be stated that \nthe debate started by Levene was basically about the historical and cultural identity of Spanish American Nations and, at the same time, about the historical action of Spain in the Indies. In this sense, the starting point was patriotic essentialism: in Francoist Spain, in the most radical nationalist terms, even though (or perhaps because of it) what they tried to defend was \nthe Old Empire; in Argentina, it was the defense of a Hispanic identity.\nOn the other hand, though the participants in this \ufb01rst debate were \nhistorians, in most cases the approach su ffered from a certain lack of atten-\ntion both to the historicity of the issue raised, as to the proper subject of \nstudy. In this regard, the image portrayed of the territorial status of the Indies \nunder the Spanish Monarchy quite resembled a static photo whose detailed \nobservation might resolve the issues raised. Thus, unconsciously, not only was the evolution of the relationship between the Crown and its dominions in the Americas over time dispensed with, but also the historicity of \u201cboth \nsubjects. \u201d Spain and the Americas were presented as compact entities with \nlittle historical evolution from the 16th to the 18th Century. Accordingly, also the relations between them and their projection in the status of the \n13 L evene (1951) 10.\n14 However, such nationalist reading of the Americas\u2019 history did not start with the new \nFrancoist regime; rather, it was common to political and academic elites of every political \nparty since the late 19th Century. F eros (2005).\n15 Acerca del t\u00e9rmino \u201ccolonia\u201d (1954). The only dissenting opinion appearing on a sum-\nmary of the debates was that of the Ukrainian historian Juan Friede, who defended the existence of a \u201ccolonization phenomenon, \u201d understood also as \u201cmaterial exploitation of \nthe indigenous people by the civilizing people. \u201d Ibid., 158.\n34 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezIndies, whether colonial or not, had to be unique and constant during these \nthree Centuries, which in no way prevented a detailed and precise exposition \nof the development of the Law of the Indies over time or of the institutional \napparatus set up for their government. The \u201ctimelessness\u201d of the adopted perspective in \ufb02uenced a deeper level, that of the assumptions underpinning \nthe whole discourse.\nThirdly, it is noteworthy that this academic debate had little signi\ufb01cance \nin both Anglo-Saxon and Latin historiographical production, despite the implications of its proposals. Indeed, it did not lead to the elimination of the concept of colony. At best, it hardly raised awareness of the semantic density of the concept and of the implications of using the term uncritically.\n2. Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa\u2019s contribution\nWith the emergence of economic history in the analysis of Spanish Ameri-\ncan reality, brought about by the Annales School, the word \u201ccolony\u201d was undisputedly placed at the heart of studies on Spanish America. The debate \ninitiated by Levene was largely set aside. From an economic standpoint, the \nbinomial metropolis-colony off ered an interpretive framework that was tak-\nen for granted.\n16In the few cases where this was noted, it was to con \ufb01rm, \nwithout any reservation, the relevance of this framework of \u201ccolonial\u201d understanding.\n17\nZorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa made his contribution to the debate in this new historio-\ngraphical context. He believed that the problem of the \u201cconstitutional sta-tus\u201d of the New World under the Spanish Monarchy was the most important problem of the Law of the Indies. However, not many authors had looked at \n16 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 90\u201391. Tau provides Ruggiero Romano\u2019s position as a paradig-\nmatic example, since the latter referred to the term colony and the resulting colonial \ndependence as a \u201cfact of general economy. \u201d Ibid., 91.\n17 Tandeter reopened the debate in economic history, not to refute the colonial assumption \nof these studies but to evidence the lack of theoretical characterization of colonial depend-\nency for the 16th, 17th and 18th Centuries. The fact that this was a purely colonial \nrelationship was unquestionable. Moreover, Tandeter believed that the debate on the col-\nonial nature of the Indies was a mere continuation of the work of Hispanophile historians trying to o ffer a positive global view of Spain\u2019s acti on in the Americas. According to this \nauthor, \u201cThus develops the pernicious polemic that denies the nature of colonies to the Indies under the Spanish rule. \u201d T andeter (1976) 156.\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy\n35it or, at least, not in depth.18Spurred by this conviction, Zorraqu\u00edn pre-\nsented a paper on this topic at the Second Venezuelan Conference of His-\ntory, held in Caracas in 1974, which was published in the collected papers of \nthe Conference19and in the journal Revista de Historia del Derecho .20Sub-\nsequently, he included it in his Estudios de Historia del Derecho.21\nAccording to Zorraqu\u00edn, the question of the political status of the Indies \nshould be answered by resorting to \u201cfacts and laws, \u201d and not to the theories \nof those who took part in the controversies over the Indies in the 16th \nCentury or to modern views. Thus, from the very beginning, he established the limits within which he would analyze the problem. This did not prevent him, however, from carrying out well-documented work with interpretation proposals which are largely valid today.\nThe speci \ufb01c issues he intended to resolve were the political status of the \nIndies in the Monarchy, the nature of their incorporation to Castile and the institutional consequences that followed.\n22With this aim in view, Zorra-\nqu\u00edn organized his work into four parts, each corresponding to a speci \ufb01c \nhistorical period: The \ufb01rst part dealt with the Indies as dominions of the \nCatholic Monarchs, and covered the pe riod between their discovery and the \ndeath of Ferdinand the Catholic (pages 61\u201379); the second part, entitled \u201cthe Indies as decentralized provinces of Castile, \u201d covered from the incorporation of the Indies to the establishment of the Bourbon dynasty (pages 80\u2013133); the third part, \u201cThe progressive centralization of the Monarchy, \u201d \ufb01nished \nwith the abdication of Bayonne and the entry of Napoleonic troops into the Peninsula (pages 134\u2013143); and the fourth part focused on the crisis of the Monarchy (pages 144\u2013161).\nAs already established by historiography, Zorraqu\u00edn veri \ufb01ed that the \nIndies had been joined to Castile in the form of an accessory union. In practice, this meant political, legal and economic dependence on the King-dom of Castile.\n23Thus, there was no equal footing with Castile or integra-\n18 Z orraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa(1988) 55.\n19 Z orraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa(1975).\n20 Z orraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa(1974).\n21 Z orraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa(1988) 55\u2013161.\n22 Ibid. 59\u201360.\n23 Zorraqu\u00edn summarized the dependence of the Indies on the Kingdom of Castile in eight \npoints: They could not decide on the election, recognition or acceptance of the King; they did not have their own Courts as other kingdoms of the Monarchy; they were not in-\n36 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9reztion into the Spanish Monarchy comparable to that of other kingdoms. \nSpanish America was subordinated to European politics and not vice versa. \nNevertheless, Zorraqu\u00edn believed that the Indies could not be considered \ncolonies for two main reasons: Firstly, because Spanish American territories were not deprived of their own government and, in addition, a special law was created for them; secondly, because the term \u201ccolonies\u201d , understood as \u201cmere dependencies exploited by another State\u201d , was anachronistic with \nregard to the New World. The meaning given to this term, therefore, was \nthe Roman Classical and, as such, it rarely appeared in the laws of the Indies. On account of the foregoing, Zorraqu\u00ed n considered that the Indies were in \nan intermediate situation: they were not totally subordinate to Castile, nor did they enjoy perfect autonomy, comparable to that of the kingdoms joined \nto the Spanish Monarchy. In the absence of a categorization in the language \nof pre-modern times, Zorraqu\u00edn spoke of \u201cdecentralized entities of the Cas-tilian administration, \u201d in the understanding that it was a territorial and self-regulating decentralization due to the high degree of self-government they attained, despite imposed centralism on the government by the Council of \nthe Indies. To sum up his position, he wrote that \u201cthere was self-regulation in \nthe region as a whole with regard to Castile, centralism imposed by the Council on the New World, and decentralization if the existence of each of the major regions into which the Indies were divided was taken into account. \u201d\n24\nIt follows from the paragraph titles of the Laws of 1681, that the Indies \nhad developed from dominions to acquire the legal status of provinces. Zorraqu\u00edn formulated his interpretation on the latter concept \u2013 deeply rooted in history \u2013 emphasizing the contrast between the autonomy \nachieved by the Spanish American provinces during the 16th and 17th \nCenturies and the process of \u201ccentralization\u201d imposed on them since the \nvolved in the government of the whole of the Monarchy nor were they incorporated into \nthe common organs of the Empire; decisions regarding international treaties and wars, \neven if affecting the Americas, were made in Europe; the most signi \ufb01cant decisions con-\ncerning the Law of the Indies were taken without participation of residents or local authorities; both the King and the most important organs of government of the Indies \nwere located in Castile and were subject to Castilian in \ufb02uence; senior o fficers, both in the \nCourt and in Spanish America were of peninsular origin; and \ufb01nally, there was trade \nmonopoly with Castile.

This policy ended with the crisis of the Monarchy and the \ncreation of the new Nations a fter their independence. Hence, Zorraqu\u00edn\u2019s \ninterpretation seemed to emphasize, without saying so expressly, the tensions that the contemplation of the government system of the Indies as a whole revealed. On the one hand, he noted a clear dependence on Castile together with the existence of some territories vested with a certain political and legal personality. On the other hand, he spoke of centralization being apparent in \njudicial and governmental institutions in the Court, particularly the Coun-\ncil, along with undeniable autonomy of operation in Spanish America.\nIn my opinion, one of Zorraqu\u00edn\u2019s greatest achievements was to perceive \nthese contrasts. To this we must add, as Tau has pointed out, the adoption of a dynamic perspective materialized in the division into four historical peri-\no d sa n d\u2013f o l l o w i n gD e m e t r i oR a m o so nt h i s\u2013\n25the relevance given to the \nterm \u201cProvince\u201d as the historically most appropriate term to refer to the \nSpanish American territories.26\nHowever, and without detracting from Zorraqu\u00edn\u2019s work of historical \nclari\ufb01cation, his use of Public Law categories coined in the 19th Century \nfor the construction of the modern liberal state, such as centralization or decentralization, led to the concealment of key dimensions of the political structuring of the Indies under the Spanish Monarchy. Unconsciously, Zor-raqu\u00edn\u2019s conception of power was essentially vertical, statist and monolithic, fundamentally alien to the legal culture that governed the formation and \ndevelopment of the Old Regime Monarchies. In this regard, but with more \nelegance, Tau has said that \u201cusing modern notions, conceived by political theory for the contemporary State, to refer to the past [\u2026] entails accepting the idea that the State \u2013 in this case the Monarchy \u2013 is created and organized \ntop down projecting fundamental rules and actions on all levels, even the \nsmallest and most remote. \u201d\n27Therefore, Tau understands that this vision \nmust be completed with one that assumes Spanish American diversity derived from geographical, temporal or spatial situation, and the existence \nof \u201ca plurality of small powers and jurisdictions that operate outside the \n25 See R amos P\u00e9rez (1959) 36\u201339. For this author, the term \u201cProvince\u201d in its fundamental \nmeaning, connected with Roman tradition and post-independence history, could be ap-\nplied to the whole Monarchy, all kingdoms being provinces at the same time.\n26 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 97, 101\u2013102 and 120.\n27 Ibid. 113.\n38 Rafael D.

And, even in the case of Garavaglia, the reference was aimed exclusively at Levene, and his tone was rather light and contemptuous.\nNonetheless, the debate was not totally alien to the legal historical per-\nspective, even though other approaches prevailed, closer to the new political history or to economic history. Of particular relevance was the participation of Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re\n30in this debate and the responses that her work \nprompted from Carmen Bernand and Juan Carlos Garavaglia.\nThe question Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re asked, and which guided her re \ufb02ection, was \nabout the ability of the terms \u201ccolony\u201d and \u201ccolonial\u201d to adequately describe any phenomenon regarding the Spanish dominions in the Americas between the 16th and 19th Centuries. As this historian pointed out, this \npractice \u2013 introduced by exponents of European Enlightenment such as \nRaynal or Robertson \u2013 was broadly welcome in the independence speech. It was used to reject en masse the period of ownership by the Spanish Crown \n28 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 113.\n29 \u201cPara seguir con el debate en torno al colonialismo \u2026, \u201d Nuevo Mundo Mundos Nuevos, \nDebates (2004), http://nuevomundo.revues.org/430, posted 08/02/2005.

Quotations correspond to \nthis version.\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 39and to lay the ideological foundations of the new Nations. Thus, Creole \npatriots, once vassals, now became colonized, and the term colony acquired \na negative connotation. This tradition of thought joined the anti-colonial \ncritique of the last third of the 19th Century, which brought about a re-interpretation of the period of Spanish rule in the Americas as \u201c \ufb01rst modern \nimperialism\u201d or caused such period to be set as the starting point of \u201cEuro-pean colonialism. \u201d\nLemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re believes it is necessary to reconvey the historical sense of \nconcepts in order to avoid anachronistic readings of the past, particularly of the so-called Old Regime societies. From her perspective, it is inappro-priate to use the term colonization in a sense other than the traditional one \u2013 devoid of negative connotation \u2013 when referring to any time prior to the \n19th Century. The French historian stresses the need for conceptualizing this \nperiod of American history by taking into account the space and time coor-dinates of the creation of these new political communities. Thus, and based on the social or sociological aspect o f the \u201cKingdoms\u201d of the Indies, it is \nLemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re\u2019s belief that it is possible to resolve the dilemma posed by Levene \nbetween colonies and kingdoms. For such purpose, it is convenient to inter-\npret from a historical perspective \u2013 that is, one open to changes and muta-tions \u2013 a number of concepts from the domain of sociology, such as \u201crepro-duction, \u201d \u201cintegration\u201d or \u201csocial control\u201d .\n31Further on, we will return to \nthis author\u2019s proposals since her thoughts may help us reconsider this debate \nfrom new viewpoints.\nThe thesis Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re defended was answered directly by Carmen Ber-\nnand and, indirectly, without refere nce to it, by Juan Carlos Garavaglia. \nBernand, who shares Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re\u2019s concern to avoid explanations outside their historical context, believes that the terms \u201ccolonialism\u201d and \u201cimperial-\nism, \u201d nonetheless, refer to models that are useful to understand Spain\u2019s policy in the New World. To that end, Bernand uses \u201cminimalist\u201d de \ufb01nitions \nas a starting point so that the terms \u201cempire\u201d and \u201cimperialism\u201d as well as \u201ccolonial\u201d or \u201ccolonialism\u201d become ideal concepts whose variations may be \napplied to di fferent historical periods. According to the\nQuillet-Flammarion\ndictionary,\u201cimperialism\u201d means \u201c politique par laquelle un grand Etat cherche \u00e0 \n\u00e9tendre sa domination ;\u201d following the model described by Georges Balandier \n31 L emp\u00e9ri\u00e8re (2004b) 107\u2013120.\n40 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezin 1955, \u201ccolonization\u201d is \u201cthe imposi tion of an external power over sub-\njected populations. \u201d32In Bernand\u2019s opinion, both models may be perfectly \napplied to the Iberian expansion into the New World, without prejudice to \nspeci \ufb01c characteristics of each particular case.33\nFrom another perspective, Garavaglia also maintains the existence of a \n\u201ccolonial relationship\u201d in the America s during the Centuries of Spanish rule, \nboth from the economic and political points of view. On the economic \nfront, Garavaglia studied the constant economic \ufb02ows from the colonies \nto the metropolis and the hard- labor jobs implemented to extract riches \nfor the Crown throughout the 16th, 17th and 18th Centuries. On the polit-ical front, the Argentine historian highlights the contrast between the rights the King could have in territories such as Naples or Aragon \u2013 of a dynastic \nnature and with limited exercise due to the existence of certain institutions \nand pre-existent rights \u2013 from those he enjoyed in Spanish America as a result of the conquest of non-Christian pe oples. This is why, Garaviglia states, \nit was possible to impose certain rights on Spanish America that would have been unthinkable to impose on other territories owned by the Monarchy. In \nthis unequal context, any negotiation \u2013 in the cases where there was one \u2013 \nseemed conditioned by power politics. Not even the feeling of white Spanish American elites nurtured by the sense of belonging to the great Spanish Nation in the 18th Century could evolve from mere feeling, and, as such, was unable to deny the existence of a hi storical relationship of colonial \nsubordination between the Americas and Spain. The Cadiz Parliament, with their mechanism for calling elections and their debate on the political rights of castes, evidenced once again that equality between both sides of the Atlantic was a chimera.\n34\n32 A similarly broad concept of the term \u201ccolonial\u201d , although not expressly de \ufb01ned, is the \none employed, for example, by Benton (2002).\n33 B ernand (2004). We cannot stop to consider the thorough development of the arguments \nput forward by Bernand, for which reason we refer the reader to the original text, and the \nsame stands for Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re\u2019s work and for all the other papers we analyze herein. In her \npaper published in the Black Book of Colonialism, Bernand had argued that even though \nboth the imposition of tributes on the indigenous peoples as well as the transfer of a \nsubstantial portion of Brazil and Spanish America\u2019s wealth to the Iberian Peninsula were clear signs of colonial domination, Peru and New Spain were not colonies themselves, \nbut kingdoms joined to the Crown, just as Naples or Navarra. B ernand (2003) 138.\n34 G aravaglia (2004).\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy\n414. Some conclusions from an endless debate\nLevene published his thought-provoking book sixty years ago. We have \nf o c u s e do u ra t t e n t i o no ns o m eo ft h em o s tr e l e v a n tc o n t r i b u t i o n st ot h i s  \ndebate published since then, but there have been other important re \ufb02ections \non this issue. In this regard, the proposal to distinguish (though up to what extent is still under discussion) Old Regime colonizations\n35from those \ncarried out by European powers throug hout the 19th and 20th Centuries \nshould be highlighted.\nAmong legal historians, there is agreement on the accessory nature of the \nu n i o nb e t w e e nt h eI n d i e sa n dt h eK i n g d o mo fC a s t i l ea n d ,a c c o r d i n g l y ,o n  their legal status as territories belonging to the referred Crown. Based on this \nassumption, Garriga states that \u201cthe question about the political status of the \nIndies [\u2026] can only be answered [\u2026] by maintaining that the Indies had no political status per se. \u201d Thus, he tries only to make it clear that, as territories added to the Crown of Castile under an\naccessory union ,t h e yl a c k e dap o l i t -\nical constitution of their own, di fferent from the Castilian one, at the heart \nof the plural Catholic Monarchy.36In this sense, the colonization of the New \nWorld was but a replication of the Castilian legal regime in the Americas. The new lands were regarded as empty spaces (though it was obvious they were not) ready to be legally completed a fter the Castilian model.\n37\nIt would be proper, however, to consider the ability of the legal categories \nof the time and, in particular, the description of the union as accessory, to adequately assess the relationship between Spanish America and Castile and, ultimately, to de \ufb01ne the place the former occupied in the Spanish Monarchy. \nThis question, as we will maintain hereinbelow, could help rethink the controversial issue of the legal status of the Indies.\n35 The expression references a paper by P oloni -Simard (2003).\n36 G arriga Acosta (2006).\n37 Part of Garriga\u2019s article is focused on the de scription of this replication of Castile in the \nIndies aft er the territorialization of the new lands, that is, their conversion into spaces \nendowed with jurisdiction.\n42 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezII. An attempt to o ffer a new re \ufb02ection on an old question\nThe \ufb01rst step in renewing a discussion with such opposing positions could \nbe to assert its eminently historiographical nature and, therefore, continue \nthe debate in academia rather than politics, or any other area characterized by ideological struggle. Ever since Levene\u2019s explicit formulation, the debate on the political status of the Indies has been followed, in most cases, by an implicit value judgment on the legitimacy and fairness of Spanish action in \nthe Americas.\nDenying the colonial nature of Spanish American territories seemed to \ninvolve certain approval of, or at least justi \ufb01cation for \u2013 given the historical \ncontext \u2013, the abuse of indigenous peoples by the Spaniards. De \ufb01nitely, it is \nutopian (and likely undesirable) to write history deprived of value judg-\nments. However, that does not mean that we can replace historical analysis \nwith ethical judgment or assert the impossibility to distinguish between \nboth areas. In other words, and regarding this issue, it should be possible to deny the colonial nature of Spanish Am erican territories for the sake of a \nmore accurate interpretation in historiographical terms, and in turn recog-nize, through such historical interpretation, the manifold abuses of native \nAmerican peoples by Castilians, or Span iards in general, whether European \nor Spanish American, as already distinguished in the 18th Century. And vice \nversa. Thus, the discussion would be relieved of its strong axiological burden and would facilitate readings with greater appeal to experts in the \ufb01eld.\nHaving explained the epistemological scope of our study, we should now \nrephrase it in positive terms. Some of the questions could be: Is it historio-\ngraphically correct to speak of \u201ccolonies\u201d and \u201ccolonial relationship\u201d in \nreference to the lands of the New World and their relation with the Castilian Crown between the late 15th Century and the \ufb01rst third of the 19th Cen-\ntury? To what extent was describing the union as accessory useful to classify the relationship between Spanish America and Castile properly? How did \nthis accessory union evolve between the 16th and 18th Centuries?\nThis issue \u2013 as raised \u2013 reminds us of another great historical debate in the \npast decades: the one on the rise of the modern State. Now, as then, we \ncould attempt to solve it in several ways. One of them is to begin by de\ufb01ning the concept under discussion (\u201ccolonies, \u201d \u201cState\u201d) as broadly as possible so \nthat it may be applied to the period concerned. This is the option chosen by \nBenard. It was also the view of most of the historiography focused on the \nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 43study of the modern State. According to Jellinek, its de \ufb01nition was based on \nt h r e ec o r ee l e m e n t s :as u p r e m ep o w e r ,at e r r i t o r ya n dap o p u l a t i o n .38In \nsuch broad terms, the \u201cState\u201d formula was applicable to political formations \na sh e t e r o g e n e o u sa sM o n a r c h i e si nt h el a t eM i d d l eA g e s ,t h e\u201c a b s o l u t e \u201d  Monarchies of the Modern Age, and the liberal States of the 19th Century. This even led to a heated discussion in Spain on the potential existence of a Visigoth State.\n39\nThe main problem of such an approach is the lack or loss of semantic \ndensity of key concepts of political and legal history. Formulating in very broad terms concepts which are key to our understanding of history, such as \u201cState\u201d or \u2013 in our case \u2013 \u201ccolony\u201d , will severely impair their interpretative potentiality in the long run. Therefore, it is not surprising that they are \neventually replaced with other concepts which allow for a more accurate \nexplanation from a historiographical viewpoint.\nAnother problem of such a discursive strategy is the distortion of the \nprocess of historical understanding, which may be caused by the heavy semantic burden acquired by those key concepts in contemporary cul-\nture.\n40Indeed, it is just a possibility since, as certain historiography has \nproven, one may discuss the State under the Old Regime without it getting \ntainted with contemporary implications, that is, without slipping in anach-ronisms by projecting into the past categories and ways of thinking that did not exist at that time.\n41\nFrom that point of view, the question Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re asked at the beginning \nof her article on the colonial paradigm makes sense: \u201cDo the terms \u2018colony\u2019 and \u2018colonial\u2019 account for Hispanic-American history from the 16th Century to their independence and up to the present?\u201d\n42We should add two further \nissues: What implicit contents fall within the \u201ccolony\u201d and \u201ccolonial\u201d cate-gories? Are those contents consistent with the place occupied by the Indies under the Spanish Monarchy, with the political system established there a fter \n38 J ellinek (1943).\n39 T orres L\u00f3pez (1926).\n40 A good critical explanation of the discussion about the so-called \u201cmodern State, \u201d in: \nGarriga Acosta (2004) 1\u20135.\n41 I am referring to the work by Paolo Grossi and the Florentine school of legal historians. \nIn this area, the works that stand out, among others, are those by Pietro Costa, Maurizio \nFioravanti, Lucca Mannori and Bernardo Sordi.\n42 L emp\u00e9ri\u00e8re (2004b) 107.\n44 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezthe conquest, and with the type of relationships maintained between the \nIndies, Castile and the other territories of the Monarchy?\nI believe these are the questions that should be asked. It is outside the \nscope of this paper to answer each of them in detail, as that would mean analyzing from di fferent perspectives the categories at issue \u2013 \u201ccolony\u201d and \n\u201ccolonial\u201d \u2013 and the vast historiography published on the subject during the past decades. However, we should bring forward some resolution proposals \nthat shed new light on this old discussion. Therefore, it is convenient to \nreview the process of integration of the Indies into the Spanish Monarchy during the 16th and 17th Centuries, and the consequences of the establish-ment of a new dynasty at the beginning of the 18th Century for both the Americas and the other territories of the formerly universal Monarchy. In \nshort, this is about de \ufb01ning the scope of the accessory nature of the union \nwith Castile during these Centuries; the historical evolution of its \u201ccontents. \u201d\n1 . T h eI n d i e sa n dt h eH o u s eo fA u s t r i a\nIt is commonplace in historiography to identify the rise of the Bourbon \ndynasty to the Spanish throne at the turn of the 18th Century as a substantial change in the conception of the Monarchy. During the 16th and 17th Cen-turies, the Spanish universal Monarchy had been a model of composite and plural Monarchy \u2013 the throne being occupied by kings of the House of \nAustria \u2013 where every kingdom maintained its original rights and liberties. \nThe Indies, a territory conquered and incorporated into the Crown of Castile in the form of an accessory union, was an \u201cessential\u201d\n43part of this conglom-\nerate of kingdoms and crowns united in the public person of the Monarch. \nPapal Bulls granted dominion over the Indies to the Catholic Monarchs and \ntheir \u201cheirs and successors, the Kings of Castile and Leon. \u201d44\n4 3 A sc a nb er e a di nt h e Recopilaci\u00f3n de leyes de Indias , Charles V had sworn in 1519 that the \nIndies \u201cwould always remain united, and for their greater perpetuity and strength, we \nprohibit the disposal thereof.

More re-\ncently, and with special treatment by legal literature on the topic, B arrientos Grand\u00f3n\n(1999).\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 45As is well-known, ius commune jurists basically distinguished two methods \nof union between kingdoms: aeque principaliter and accessory. In the words \nof Cresp\u00ed in the 17th Century, the kingdoms or provinces joined under an \naeque principaliter union \u201cretain their own nature and keep it separate, as \nthough they were still ruled by the same princes prior to the union, each \nkeeping the same law as if they were to remain separate. \u201d45In contrast, \nwhere a province was added or joined to a kingdom under an accessory \nunion, they became a single kingdom governed by the law and privileges \nof the kingdom to which they were united.46\nAs regards Spanish American territories, the accessory nature of their \nunion to the Kingdom of Castile rapidly caught on. The lack of consolidated \nChristian kingdoms in the New World, such as that of Navarre in the Old, \nmade it easier to consider those foreign lands a mere extension of the Old \nWorld, and especially of Castile. That is why, from the outset, Castilian Law was applied generally in the Americas, together with the old\nius commune , \nwhich was also that of the New World, as well as the new local laws, expressed in a host of written or customary sources. From this standpoint, \nthe order of the sources applicable in Spanish America did not give rise to \nany particular dispute, as had been the case in other conquered territories, such as Navarre.\n47According to the Ordenanzas de Audiencias [Ordinances of \nAudiencias ] of 1530, Emperor Charles V had ruled that, were the provisions \nissued for Spanish America not to apply, the laws of the Kingdom of Castile \nwould apply in accordance with the Leyes de Toro [Law of Toro]. This prin-\nciple was reproduced in the Recopilaci\u00f3n [Compilation] of 1681, along with \nanother law whereby \u201csuch cases as may not be determined by the laws of \nthis Recopilaci\u00f3n shall be subject to the laws of the Recopilaci\u00f3n y Partidas\n[Compilation and Seven-Part Code] of this Kingdom of Castile. \u201d48\nOn the other hand, in the Ordenanzas del Consejo de Indias [Ordinances of \nthe Council of the Indies] of 1571, Philip II had mandated that the \u201cStates \n45 Regarding the Catholic Monarchy, this Catalan jurist stated \u201cRegna Castellae, Aragoniae, \nLusitanae, Flandriae, Neapolis et Siciliae, unit ae s s ei nM o n a r c h i aH i s p a n i c aa e q u ep r i n -\ncipaliter: Regna vero indiarum occidentalium unita esse accessoriae Regno Castellae, et \nIndias Orientales regno Lusitaniae. \u201d C resp\u00ed de Valdaura (1677) 187.\n46 C resp\u00ed de Valdaura (1677) 187.\n47 See G al\u00e1nLorda (2012).\n48 Book II, Title I, Laws II and I.\n46 Rafael D.

This process included the division of the \nSpanish American territory into major provinces, ruled by their respective \nAudiencias , and minor provinces, as well as the foundation of cities.\nHowever, the distinction made by legal scholars between aeque principa-\nliter and accessory unions was unable to adequately explain the articulation \no fau n i v e r s a lM o n a r c h y ,s u c ha st h a to fS p a i n ,a n d ,i np a r t i c u l a r ,t h eu n i o n  of an entire continent to a Crown, such as that of Castile.\n50The fact that \nCresp\u00ed or Sol\u00f3rzano have written that the Indies had joined Castile under an \naccessory union did not mean that this legal construction properly re \ufb02ected \nthe institutional and legal reality of the New World under the Catholic Monarchy. In my opinion, putting, for such purpose, the so-called King-\ndoms of the Indies and Kingdoms of Grenade or Murcia on the same footing \nas territories which had joined Castile under an accessory union showed the rigidity of the legal \u201ccategories\u201d used, which evidenced the limitations of legal theories conceived at a time when there was only one world: the Old World.\nAccordingly, as time went by, the territorial status of the Indies, as prov-\ninces which had joined Castile under an accessory union, was gradually overtaken by reality. They shared Castile\u2019s political status, since they were part of it, as if they were a mere extension of its territory. Nevertheless, their \n49 Book II, Title II, Law XIII: \u201cand because the kingdoms of Castile and the Indies belong to \none Crown, their laws and government system ought therefore to be as alike as possible. \nThe members of the Council shall try, in the laws and institutions which they may estab-\nlish for those States, to reduce the form and manner of their government to the style and \norder by which the kingdoms of Castile and Leon are ruled to the extent allowed by the \ndiversity and di fference of lands and peoples. \u201d Philip II, Ordinance 14 of the Council of \n1571.\n50 The limitation of this distinction to explain the complexity of the unions between king-\ndoms in the Modern Age has been highlighted by Elliott. The English historian cited as an \nexample the union between England and Scotland in 1707, a type of union that does not \n\ufb01t fully into any of these categories.

Moreover, that legal regime had to be supplemented with a myriad of provisions issued by both the Court and the di fferent instances of \nSpanish American governments. But, as Tau has determined, the source of law that better adapted to the new needs was custom.\n51The speci \ufb01c nature \nof this new law did not re \ufb02ect only in the well-known Recopilaci\u00f3n de \nLeyes de Indias [Compilation of Indias\u2019 Law], a compilation promulgated \nby Charles II in 1681 which had no parallel in the territories that had joined Castile under an accessory union; it found its greatest expression in the customary dimension, both in the so-called Republic of Spaniards and \nRepublic of Indians. In this light, although it is important to realize that \nthere was no legal regime of the Indies as such, di fferent from that of Castile, \nthis conclusion is considerably played down, if not in the context of jurists\u2019 discourse \u2013 with its mere conceptual distinctions \u2013 than in the context of law in action.\nThe particularity of those lands was not only re \ufb02ected in the legal sources, \nb u ta tt h ei n s t i t u t i o n a ll e v e la sw e l l .S u ffice it to mention, the institutions \ncreated\nex novo or the legal entities under ius commune for the government of \nindigenous peoples, such as encomiendas or indigenous villages.

The most evident case, which most directly a ffects our topic, is \nprobably giving indigenous peoples the status of \u201cmiserable\u201d persons, one given by\nius commune to \u201crustics, \u201d \u201cwidows\u201d , or \u201cunderage orphans\u201d .52Thus, \nindigenous peoples or Indians, who had had their natural freedom and their condition as vassals of the Crown recognized from as early as 1500, became legally incorporated in the corporative regime of the Monarchy, although in \n51 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2001).\n52 See D uve(2004).

Garc\u00eda P\u00e9reza situation comparable to the underage, that is, under the Sovereign\u2019s tute-\nlage through its o fficers in the Americas.\nThis shared legal condition cannot be understood in terms of social \nhomogenization. The \u201cIndians\u201d were in reality a creation of the conquest. Before the Spaniards\u2019 arrival, the American continent was populated by highly diverse ethnic communities: the Mayas, Aymaras, Mexicas, Arauca-nians, etc., but not by \u201cIndians. \u201d A fter the conquest, and under the umbrella \nterm of \u201c\npersonae miserabiles , \u201d \u201cIndians\u201d kept on forming heterogeneous \ngroups, engaged in di fferent activities, with very diverse rights and obliga-\ntions which evolved over the years. Hence, these communities, forming the so-called \u201cRepublic of Indians\u201d which, in turn, consisted of a plurality of \u201cpersonal\u201d statutes, did not remain the same over the Centuries either.\nThe consequences of the military, cultural and legal conquest of the \nterritory among natives in those lands are explained by di fferent factors. \nA few of them include: the transformation of their old traditions; their acceptance or rejection of the conquerors; their capacity to survive diseases then unknown, or the violence and mistreatment by the Spaniards; and their adaptation to new religious and cultural patterns or to the political mecha-\nnisms imposed by the Crown. In some cases, the \ufb01nal result was the mere \nextinction or the drastic reduction of the American Indian population; in \nother cases, it was the compulsory or negotiated integration into a new social and political structure, the Spanish Monarchy, in which they would interact with other groups and communities in an ongoing process of identity rede-\n\ufb01nition. There were also examples of escape to the margins of the system \nover the Centuries, a prolonged resistance which could still not avoid cul-tural and economic exchanges with the Spaniards.\nEventually, given this plurality of underlying situations, an Old Regime \nsociety was reproduced in the Americas, based on socio-political, rather than economic, criteria. As historiography has o ften shown, a corporative society \nwas established out of dependency relations articulated in more limited geographical areas, mainly in cities, towns, villages or farms, based on a common religion and united under the Sovereign, of whom everyone was a vassal. As late as 1806, in an inquiry on marriage and access to o ffices by \nmulattos, the Council of the Indies stated that\n\u201c I ti su n d e n i a b l et h a tt h ee x i s t e n c eo fd i fferent hierarchies and classes is of the \nutmost importance for the survival and proper governance of a Monarchy, where \ngradual and linked dependence and subordination achieve and maintain the lowest \nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 49vassal\u2019s obedience of and respect for the Sovereign\u2019s authority, a system all the more \nnecessary in the Americas, given the greater distance from the throne (\u2026). \u201d53\nThis does not mean that economic criteria were irrelevant; they were simply \nnot recognized for the social and cult ural role they would play during the \n19th and 20th Centuries. Accordingly, despite the existence of conquerors and conquered, or exploiters and exploited, it is inappropriate to analyze Spanish American social reality solely in these terms, especially a fter the \ufb01rst \nconquest period.\n54It would be further inappropriate to represent such social \nreality by placing a subordinate class, the \u201cIndians, \u201d against another, the white, that would appear \u2013 by contrast \u2013 as \u201cindependent\u201d or \u201cdominant. \u201d As can be clearly inferred from the words of the Council transcribed above, the entire American society, as well as European societies, consisted of \ngroups or estates that depended on each other, to a greater or lesser extent, \ndespite their di fferent manifestations. However, a phenomenon emerged in \nthe Indies which was unprecedented in the Peninsula: the existence of ethnic subordination criteria that a ffected particularly the native inhabitants of \nthose lands. These dependence-based relationships were part of a pre-modern \npolitical system, ideally based on patterns of inequality, under which they \nmade sense. Nevertheless, this observation entails no justi \ufb01cation whatso-\never, nor does it in any other pattern of inequality existing in those times.\nThe level of social integration and stability achieved in the Americas can \nonly be understood from a di fferent social model, that of estate-based struc-\ntures under the Old Regime. In this regard, as emphasized by Poloni-Simard, integration was possible, among other re asons, because in Spanish coloniza-\ntion, the King\u2019s justice \u2013 channeled through its offi cers \u2013 was established at \nt h ec o r eo fs o c i a lr e l a t i o n s h i p s .\n55This should not be construed as supporting \nany idyllic representation of Old Regime societies, let alone the one created \n53 In this same inquiry, the Council judged that equating mulattos with whites in issues \nwhich were the subject matter of the inquiry \u201cwould bring about disputes, alterations \nand other consequences which must be avoided in a Monarchy, where the classi \ufb01cation \nof classes contributes to enhanced order, security and good governance, and where opin-ion prevails over the ideas of equality and confusion. \u201d Consulta del Consejo sobre la \nhabilitaci\u00f3n de pardos para empleos y matrimonios, Madrid, julio de 1806, in K onetzke\n(1962) 825 and 822.\n54 In this regard, see P \u00e9rez Herrero (2002) 117.\n55 For this author, \u201cla justice doit \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e comme l\u2019institution centrale de la colonisa-\nt i o ne s p a g n o l ee nA m \u00e9 r i q u ee n t r eX V I\neet XVIIIesi\u00e8cle\u201d .

Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezin the Spanish Indies, but merely highlights the shared social, institutional \nand imaginary mechanisms that allowed for the operation and maintenance \nof such an unequal political system. Justice, whether secular or ecclesiastical, \nenjoyed a privileged position in dispute mediation and the preservation of a system deemed pre-established. We should further mention other contri-buting factors, whose analysis e xceeds the scope of this paper.\n56\nLikewise, the \u201cSpanish American speci \ufb01city\u201d translated into the adapta-\ntion to the new environment of institutions typically Castilian, such as the \naudiencias and municipios , which, without radically altering their original \nfeatures, adopted their own pro \ufb01les in the Indies.57\nThe creation in 1524 of a supreme Council, the Council of the Indies, is \neven more relevant to our subject of analysis.58The creation of this supreme \ncourt symbolically placed the Indies on an equal footing with the other kingdoms which had been united under an\naeque principaliter union in \nthe\ufb01gure of the Monarch. The Councils were the utmost institutional \nexpression of the plurality which characterized the Catholic Monarchy. As Cresp\u00ed de Valldaura expounded a fter describing this plural structure, the \ninability of Sovereigns to administer justice in person in each and every territory called for the constitution of some kind of \u201ccommon homeland\u201d of the entire Monarchy where every province and its subjects could have justice dispensed. In this \u201c\ncuria regia \u201d \u2013 as Cresp\u00ed went on to say \u2013 jurisdic-\ntions should not overlap, but be fairly divided, as though justice were admin-\nistered in every province, so that the su preme Council of Castile did not hear \ncases pertaining to the kingdoms of the Crown of Aragon, which were to be \nsubstantiated in the Council of Aragon, just like Italian cases had to be heard by the Council of Italy and Portuguese cases, by the Council of Portugal.\n59\nThus, the \u201c polisinodial \u201dr e g i m er e \ufb02ected the \u201cplural\u201d constitution of the \nMonarchy, serving as a link between the Sovereign and his subjects. As Berm\u00fadez de Pedraza put it,\n\u201cThe superior government of this Monarchy is admirably divided into twelve Coun-\ncils, business being divided by kingdom and subject-matter.

The presidents do not usually vote on matters of justice, but are the \nimmediate means of communication between His / Her Majesty and His / Her King-\ndoms. \u201d60\nThe Council system was a more or less functional solution to the problems \narising from governing a complex framework of territories through the \nCourt. Furthermore, the Councils were also the meeting point between \nthe King, on whose behalf they acted, and the territories subject to his jurisdiction, which they also represented, that is to say, which they caused to appear in spirit before the King. In such regard, Sol\u00f3rzano stated that \u201cthe quality and prominence of Councils and Magistrates is observed and regu-\nlated by that of the kingdoms and states they rule and represent. \u201d\n61Similarly, \nin a footnote, this jurist noted that the Councils worked with Ambassadors \nwho were \u201cmore or less honoured, and preferred according to the place and status of the Princes or Provinces they sometimes represented. \u201d\n62Hence, \ninter alia ,t h er e l e v a n c eo fc o n \ufb02icts over precedence among Councils was \nsuch that, from our viewpoint, alien to the culture prevailing at the time, it is impossible to understand. In this case, and on the basis of these assump-tions, Sol\u00f3rzano did not hesitate to assert the prominence of the Council of the Indies over the Council of Flanders in public acts, since the former was in charge of \u201cnot only the government of a county or kingdom, but that of \nan empire which embraces so many kingdoms and such rich and powerful \nprovinces, or, in better words, the broadest and most extended Monarchy the world has ever known, as it actually comprises another world. \u201d\n63\n60 B erm\u00fadez de Pedraza (1635) 1\u20133, cited in: R ivero Rodr\u00edguez (2004) 507.\n61 S ol\u00f3rzano y Pereira (1776) 177.\n62 Ibid. (1776) 177.\n63 Ibid. 178. In another passage of this same memorial, Sol\u00f3rzano states that by virtue of the \naccessory union it might be understood that the Empire of the Indies, just as its governing Council, is part of that of Castile (p. 188). He also explains that the Council of the Indies \ncame into being as a result of the development of business on those lands, so it is possible \nto assert that once the administration of these matters was removed from the Council of \nCastile, \u201cauthority [remained] united as a whole. \u201d (p. 189). These statements, which appa-\nrently deny the personality of the Council of the Indies as a separate institution from the Council of Castile, ought to be interpreted within the framework in which Sol\u00f3rzano \nformulated them, i. e., to prove the seniority of the Council of the Indies over that of \nFlanders. In a di fferent paragraph of this memorial, he argued that the Council of the \n52 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezAs Rivero has pointed out with reference to the Council of Italy, this \nrepresentative dimension of Councils endowed the di fferent territories sub-\nject to their jurisdiction with unity and provided them with organicity, \nwithin their corporate jurisdictional structure, just like the other kingdoms and crowns.\n64That is how the Council of the Indies acted in relation to \nSpanish American land. In spite of its great diversity and the complexity of its jurisdictional structures, linked to the very evolution of the process of \nconquest and colonization, the existence of a Council of the Indies, gradu-\nally distinguished from that of Castile, also led to the endowment of those territories with a certain political status of their own within the Castilian Crown. However, this process was not a utomatic. As we have already stated, \nin 1511 there was a Board within the Council of Castile, responsible for \nhearing issues pertaining to the Indies, while in 1524 it became a separate \nCouncil. Under the\nOrdenanzas de 1571 [Ordinances of 1571], Philip II \nprohibited the other Councils and cou rts from intruding by hearing issues \npertaining to the Indies, thus consolid ating its position within the system of \nCouncils, as well as that of the Indies within the Castilian Crown.65In 1600, \njust like the Council of Castile, the Council of the Indies was provided with its own Chamber for the allocation of bene \ufb01ts and o ffices in the Indies.\n66In \n1614, Philip III ordered that no mandate served by another council be observed unless it had already been submitted to the Council of the Indies. In 1626, Philip IV mandated that no pragmatic sanction promulgated in the \nKingdoms of Castile be enforced in Spanish America, unless a mandate \nissued by the Council of the Indies ordered that it had to be observed.\n67\nTen years later, this same King conferred ecclesiastical powers upon the Council of the Indies, thus inhibiting the Council of Castile.\n68\nIndies is truly Supreme, without possible recourse to any other tribunal, as Philip II \nexpressly established in the second ordinance of 1571 (p. 198).\n64 R ivero Rodr\u00edguez (2004) 507.\n65 Recopilaci\u00f3n de leyes de Indias, Book II, Title II, Law II: \u201cthe Council of the Indies shall \nhave supreme jurisdiction over the West Indies, whether already discovered or to be dis-covered, and the business arising therefrom and depending thereon, and for their good \ngovernance and judicial administration it may issue Orders and consult with our Laws, \nPragmatic Ordinances, etc. \u201d\n66 S ch\u00e4fer(1935) 179.\n67 Recopilaci\u00f3n de leyes de Indias, Book II, Title I, Law XXXIX.68 Recopilaci\u00f3n de leyes de Indias, Book II, Title II, Law III.\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy\n53If, within the Court, the foundation of the Council provided an institu-\ntional dramatization of the unity of the New World without altering its legal \nstatus \u2013 that of a territory which had joined the Crown of Castile under an \naccessory union \u2013 in the Indies, the consolidation of a civic culture and the formation of a creole elite enabled the gradual formulation of a self-de \ufb01ning \ndiscourse, which, on the basis of its urban location, also referred to the Indies as an entity distinct from Castile within the realm of the Spanish \nMonarchy. This discourse revolved mainly around the natural obligation of \nreserving o ffices for the natives of those lands.\n69Logically, this was aimed at \ndefending local o ffices from Castilians. The purpose was to turn Spanish \nAmerica into a perfect community, a separate territory within the common Spanish Monarchy, as was Navarre. Since the late 16th Century, this dis-\ncourse was accompanied by a remarkable increase in the level of self-govern-\nment of local powers in the Indies, which was mostly achieved by means of t h ep u r c h a s eo fm o s to ft h eo ffices in Spanish America, in particular, in \naudiencias and cabildos .70\n2. The Bourbons and the Hispanization of the plural Monarchy\nWhen Charles II died, the Spanish Monarchy had a plural composition where the Indies had gradually acquired some political entity, both on the institu-tional level and that concerning political discourse. On the basis of these \nassumptions, the establishment of the Bourbon Dynasty has been tradition-\nally construed as the beginning of a clear change of direction. Thus, the enthronement of Philip V would not hav e entailed just the extinction of \nthe judicial and executive institutions proper to the territories of the Crown \nof Aragon and, accordingly, their disappearance as a political entity di fferent \nfrom the Crown of Castile, but, in particular, it would have entailed the \nbeginning of a new way of thinking \u201cSpain, \u201d focused on the increasing cen-tralism and authoritarianism of the suc cessive Monarchs. This process would \nhave concluded in the reign of Charles IV with the in \ufb02uence of the almighty \nGodoy, whose despotism would have led directly to the crisis of the Mon-archy and, consequently, to the extinction of the Hispanic Empire, except for some colonies such as Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.\n69 See H erzog (2004); G arriga Acosta (2003).\n70 See the already classic B urkholder /Chandler (1977).\n54 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezNow is not the time to criticize this reading of 18th-Century Spain, rather \nconsolidated in historiography, or to t race the origins of this constructive \nparadigm.71Clearly, there are many reasons supporting this interpretation. \nIn addition to the Nueva Planta Decrees and the patrimonial understanding \nof power behind the acts by Philip V ,72there are many other measures \nevidencing the Crown\u2019s increasing interest in having more expedite and effective mechanisms for decision-making and the enforcement of policies, \nas well as in recovering positions of power. In this regard, we should men-tion, by way of example: the creation and development of the Secretariats of State [\nSecretar\u00edas de Estado y del Despacho ]; the creation of intendencias ;t h e  \nprofessionalization of the army; the (temporary) suppression of internal customs; the rationalization of the tax system; the reform of the system of \n\ufb02eets and galley slaves; and the introduction of the company system in \np e r i p h e r a lr e g i o n s ,o rt h es t r u g g l et oc o n t r o lt h es a l eo fo ffices.\nHowever, we should not lose sight of the \u201cstructural\u201d limitations imposed \nby the very \u201cconstitution\u201d of the Monarchy upon any process of\nnationaliza-\ntion and standardization of the political territory. Despite these and other \nmeasures of great signi \ufb01cance adopted by successive Bourbon kings, the \nSpanish Monarchy maintained its institutional plurality and its jurisdictional \nstructures. The Secretariats of State did not suppress all secular councils. In fact, some of them, such as those in Castile or, to a lesser extent, in Navarre and the Indies, continued playing a key role in the governance of their \nrespective territories.\n73On the other hand, intendentes coexisted with corre-\ngidores and alcaldes mayores in the Peninsula and in the Americas, and the \naudiencias maintained their leading role over this period. We should further \nmention the importance of ecclesiastical jurisdiction and the di fferent spe-\ncial jurisdictions largely dividing public space and limiting any monopolistic \nclaim of political power. This institutional \u201cduplicity, \u201d which has led histor-iography to talk about the con \ufb02ictive coexistence over this Century of two \n71 An explanation for the \ufb01rst half of the Century, based on propaganda by the supporters of \nthe Bourbon dynasty in the succession con \ufb02ict can be found in S tiffoni (1989).\n72 On the patrimonial logic behind the measures adopted by Phillip V , see F ern\u00e1ndez  \nAlbaladejo (1992) 380; G arriga Acosta (2006) 94\u201396.\n73 S es\u00e9Alegre (1994); G arc\u00eda P\u00e9rez (1998). On a more favorable view of the relegation of \nthe Council of the Indies as a consequence of the creation of the Secretariats of State, see \nBernard (1972); C abrera Bosch (1993).\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 55parallel or overlapping Monarchies \u2013 one \u201cadministrative, \u201d the other \u201cjuris-\ndictional\u201d \u2013,74explains some of the di fficulties in understanding the 18th \nCentury from the perspective of the operation of di fferent power dynamics.\nSuch diversity of institutional structures and logic of power can be clearly \nseen at the higher governmental levels of the Monarchy. In this case, the Council of the Indies saw its authority disputed by the creation of a Secre-tariat of State of the Navy and the Indies. It was established in 1714, together \nwith the Secretariats of War, State and Justice, which re \ufb02ected not only the \nimplementation of a new form of government in matters related to the New \nWorld, but also the consideration of the Indies as a mere branch of \u201cadmin-istration, \u201d along with others such as the Navy or War. In a sense, the measure could be construed as a denial of the political status implicitly recognized \nwith the creation and consolidation of a Council of the Indies over the \nprevious two Centuries, coexisting with other councils for other territories of the Monarchy.\nIn the 18th Century, the Secretariat of State had a checkered evolution.\n75\nIt was removed in 1715, restored in 1720 as Secretariat of War, the Navy and \nthe Indies, only to become the Secretariat of the Navy and the Indies in 1721. \nIn 1754, its structure changed when matters pertaining to the Indies were separated from those pertaining to th e Navy, to form two separate Secretar-\niats of State which, nonetheless, were still headed by the same Secretary. In 1787, upon the death of G \u00e1lvez and the creation of the\nJunta Suprema de \nEstado [Supreme Board of State], the Secretariat of the Indies was split into \ntwo with a view to expediting the handling of matters in the Americas. In 1790, in line with Floridablanca\u2019s projections to join interests on both sides of the Atlantic, matters concerning the Indies were distributed among the \nother \ufb01ve Secretariats of State, a solution that had already been contem-\nplated in the instruction reserved for the\nJunta de Estado (No. CXLV). This \nwas aimed not only at streamlining and securing \u201cTreasury and War \nexpenses, resources and assistance\u201d on both hemispheres, but also at \u201clargely deterring hatefulness for such separation of interests, charges and objects, \n74 On this regard, see the classic work by H inrichs (1986).

Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezwhich destroys the Spanish Monarchy and divides it into two Empires. \u201d76\nHowever, as explained below, Floridabl anca\u2019s non-colonial idea of governing \nthe Americas was not the only one, and not even the most prevalent in the \nCourt, during the second half of the 18th Century.\nThe fact that most matters concerning the Americas were handled \nthrough the speci \ufb01c channels, that is, through the relevant Secretariat of \nState, did not downplay the leading role of the secular Council of the Indies. \nWhile still being the highest court for Spanish American matters, the Coun-\nc i la l s oe x p e r i e n c e dac h a n g ei nc o m p o s i t i o ni nt h er e i g no fC h a r l e sI I Ia n d  became a benchmark for most of the re forms introduced in the Americas \nduring those years.\n77Its continuity over time was, on an institutional level, a \nclear manifestation of the speci \ufb01c nature of the Spanish American territories \nwithin the Crown of Castile. It was also a clear manifestation of the ongoing idea of government linked to the right of justice.\nWithin the framework of this institutional complexity, merely outlined \nhere for the peak of the Monarchy, the Ministers of Charles III adopted the policies to be implemented a fter the defeat in the Seven Years\u2019 War along \nlines that had already been anticipated during the previous two reigns. On the international level, the imperial expansion of foreign powers, mainly England, France and Holland, demande d political action to ensure Spanish \ndominion over the New World. A fter the independence of the thirteen \ncolonies in America, it became even more necessary to change a traditional \nsystem of government that had allowed a high degree of self-government in \nthose lands.\nIn this context, we can also gain a better insight into the consolidation of \na discourse and politics with colonia l features in the Court, as well as the \nreactions this caused among the elites of the Indies. It was at that moment, in the 18th Century and not before, that the Indies were referred to as colonies for the \ufb01rst time. It should be noted, however, that just as it is \nnot possible to reduce the 18th-Century institutional structure of the Mon-archy to a consistent and systematic unit \u2013 since it was more the outcome of \na historic development marked by a collection of di fferent institutional \nlogics rather than the design of a Cabinet projected over an empty space \n76 E scudero (2001), II, 68.\n77 I have dealt with this matter in G arcia P\u00e9rez (1998). This \u201crebirth of the Council\u201d was \nbrought to attention by B urkholder (1976).\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 57available to the Sovereign \u2013, neither is it possible to unitize the di fferent \npolicies issued by the Court for the Americas in the 18th Century, or any \nsupporting discourse to legitimize them. Therefore, while focusing on the \nemergence of a true \u201ccolonial\u201d discourse in the 18th Century, we should not overlook its coexistence with other discourse of a di fferent nature, aimed at \nachieving a better unity of interests between Creole elites and the Crown. We have just seen this when discussing the extinction of the Secretariats of \nState for the Indies in 1790, with Floridablanca leading the King\u2019s Ministers. \nSome years earlier, in 1768, the extraordinary Council formed in the Council of Castile had articulated the need to send Spaniards to the Indies to hold \u201cthe major o ffices, Bishoprics and Sinecures, and to have the Creoles hold \nequivalent o ffices in Spain. \u201d This would establish stronger ties and lead to a \n\u201cunited Nation. \u201d The goal was to ease tension in the Americas a fter the \nexpulsion of the Jesuits and to deter any independence movement.\n78\nIn addition to this unifying discourse, we should mention the persistence \nof old political conceptions over the whole 18th Century, in line with the prevailing ideas of previous Centuries. In light of this plural background, we \nmay assess the scope of colonial discourse supported by some Ministers and \nmaterialized in the adaptation of speci \ufb01c political measures for the Americas \nduring the last decades of the Old Regime.\n3. Colonial discourse and its institutional incidence\nIt is not our intent to discuss here in detail the reforms initiated by the Crown \nsince 1763: the policy of appointment of senior offi cers that privileged the \nPeninsulars vis-\u00e0-vis the Creoles; the extension of the system of\nintendencias to \nmost of the Americas; the creation of new viceroyalties and provincial boun-daries; the introduction of signi \ufb01cant tax reforms; the formation of a perma-\nnent Royal Army, and the implementation of the militia system, etc.\n79While \nwe cannot state \u2013 as noted above \u2013 that the Court had developed a consistent political program for the Americas, since actors, interests and principles \n78 The report is reproduced by N avarro Garc\u00eda (1996).

Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezinvolved in the adoption and execution of such decisions varied to a great \nextent, we can state that there were some goals behind many of the reforms \ncarried out during the second half of the 18th Century.\nOn the one hand, as o ften underlined, \u201cBourbon reforms\u201d were aimed at \nsecuring the defense of Spanish American territories. Financing such an \nendeavor required a considerable increase in the revenues from the Amer-icas. Though the target of these policies was the Americas, they focused \nb a s i c a l l yo nS p a i n ,o nt h ep r e s e r v a t i o no fi t sE m p i r ei na ni n t e r n a t i o n a l  \nsetting di fferent from that of previous Centuries. At the same time, within \nthe context of the\nAudiencias \u2013 a centerpiece of the American government \u2013, \naction was taken to restore a justice system that had been shaken over decades by practices such as the sale of Court o ffices or, more generally, \nthe deep-seated roots of judges in the Indies society.\n80\nThese reforms were accompanied with the simultaneous publication of \nprojects concerning the government of Spanish America. The presence of enlightened ideals of government among many of the Court\u2019s Ministers, with emphasis on the virtues of trade and economic development towards \npeoples\u2019 progress, and the exemplary policy promoted by foreign powers for \ntheir overseas domains, also led Spain to work on new governmental pro-posals for the Americas, whereby such lands could emerge from \u201ctheir state of decadence, \u201d a popular clich\u00e9 then. In most cases, the proposals were clearly in line with those adopted during the \ufb01rst half of the Century by authors \nsuch as Macanaz, Jer\u00f3nimo de Ust \u00e1riz or the author of \u201c\nNuevo sistema de \ngobierno para la Am\u00e9rica \u201d [\u201cNew Governmental System for the Americas\u201d], \ndated 1743 and mistakenly attributed to Jos\u00e9 del Campillo.81Even if it is \npossible to establish a connection between the theoretical proposals and the \ninstitutional reforms, it is always advisable to maintain both areas well di ffer-\nentiated. Both are important from a historical point of view. Both reveal the \nideas then prevailing in the Court\u2019s circles about the right position of the Americas within the Spanish Monarchy. However, their practical signi \ufb01cance \nhas not been the same.\nThe terms used by the Ministers and senior Offi cers of Charles III, in \naddition to the terms \u201cKingdoms\u201d and \u201cProvinces, \u201d predominantly used in the political jargon, particularly in the legal area, now included the term \n80 See G arriga Acosta (2002).\n81 See N avarro Garc\u00eda (1995a).\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 59\u201ccolonies. \u201d Yet, the term was o ften reserved to refer to colonies of foreign \np o w e r s ,i . e . ,F r e n c h ,E n g l i s h ,D u t c h ,o rP o r t u g u e s ec o l o n i e s .W h i l ea ne m -\npirical study should be conducted to assert this unmistakably, any historian \nacquainted with 18th-Century archive sources would be able to note it.\nIn other cases, the use of the binomial metropolis-colonies reveals the \nmodernization of a discourse that was still based on traditional guidelines or, at least, that had not yet adopted the patterns of modern colonialism. There \nare many examples in that regard, but let us focus on the policy pursued by \nthe Crown in the Americas during the reign of Charles III. We refer to the well-known plan of\nintendencias designed by G \u00e1lvez after visiting New Spain, \nand the reports prepared by the Bishops of Puebla and \u201cthis metropolis, \u201d i. e., Mexico, as mandated by the Viceroy of New Spain, the Marquis de Croix.\n82\nAfter a careful reading of the project, one can note the coexistence of \ncolonial languages and policies with others consistent with reformist prem-ises of the Old Regime, where the preservation of the political order appears related to the eff ectiveness of mechanisms ensuring o fficers\u2019 good behavior \nand fairness. The reform proposed by G \u00e1lvez is intended to \u201cstandardize both \nthe government of these great Colonies and the government of the metrop-olis, \u201d since\nintendencias had already been introduced into the Peninsula \ufb01fty \nyears earlier. While G \u00e1lvez uses the terms \u201ccolonies\u201d and \u201cmetropolis, \u201d the \nstandardization of the former and the latter is inconsistent with politics of a colonial nature. Spanish Americans could consider it despotic \u2013 rather than \ncolonial \u2013 action to the extent it violated acquired rights. The problem lay in \nthe fact that \u201cthe huge kingdoms of Spanish America\u201d were in decline because they maintained a government \u201cthat imitated the metropolis\u2019 for-mer government. \u201d Therefore, it was logical to apply in those lands \u201cthe \nhealthy remedies that had cured the ills of its head. \u201d\n83\nAccording to G \u00e1lvez, the problem was that the existing system of govern-\nment in \u201cthis important and extensive Monarchy of New Spain\u201d prevented \nthe Viceroy from \u201cestablishing good order and justice. \u201d The fact was that the one hundred and \ufb01fty\nalcaldes mayores andcorregidores , having no salary, did \nbusiness in such lands to the detriment of the King\u2019s vassals and to the Crown itself, which lost substantial income.

Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezintendente was, in the opinion of G \u00e1lvez, the remedy for this \u201cruinous con-\nstitution. \u201d84\nAt the same time, the plan included indications that revealed the sub-\nordination of American to Peninsular interests, such as the references to \nsetting up factories \u201cprohibited in the Colonies. \u201d It was not G \u00e1lvez\u2019s original \nidea. From this standpoint, the subordination of manufacturing companies in the Indies to Peninsular interests had been supported some years earlier by \nthe author of\nNuevo Sistema de Gobierno .85However, this was neither the \nonly nor the primary goal of Bourbon reformist policies, aimed rather at \nregaining control over power structures on both sides of the Atlantic and at securing the integrity of its possessions in the Americas.\n86Likewise, attrib-\nuting \u201cnatural neglect and laziness\u201d to indigenous people was not new \neither. Nonetheless, the proposal insisted on the need to eradicate a business \nthat caused considerable harm: the distribution of merchandise.87\nThe report prepared by the Bishop of Puebla, strongly in favor of G \u00e1lvez\u2019s \nproposals, focused on the need to standardize government on both sides of the Atlantic; however, neither the language used nor the proposals made \nallow us to talk about the emergence of a new colonial mindset. Firstly, the \nBishop denied the novelty of the project, as it already existed in Spain. Expanding it into the Americas \u2013 he explained \u2013 would avoid losing many souls and would put an end to the ill-treatment of indigenous people by \nalcaldes mayores and to the damage caused to the Royal Treasury. The plan \nwas justi \ufb01ed by its e ffects and by itself: Since Spain (identi \ufb01ed with Castile) \nand the Americas formed \u201ca single Kingdom, \u201d they should move towards standardized government inasmuch as possible, as vindicated by the history of colonization. The Bishop was not thinking about other foreign powers\u2019 \nexternal policy, but that of ancient peoples. Conquering nations transformed \nconquered nations, basically by reciprocal marriage. Therefore, it was desir-able that Spanish and native families be joined in marriage, at least princi-pals\u2019 and\ncaciques\u2019 families. A very di fferent consideration was given to ple-\nbeian Indians, incapable of governing themselves.88\n84 Ibid. 112\u2013114.\n85 C ampillo y Cos\u00edo (1789); W ard (1779).\n86 P erez Herrero /Naranjo Orovio /Casanovas Codina (2008) 40.\n87 Informe y plan de intendencias (n. 82) 123, 125.

The Indies were members of the Spanish Monarchy, \nbranches of a tree, and, as such, should bear fruit. Intendencias would not \nonly put an end to vassal su ffering, but also report substantial pro \ufb01ts to the \nRoyal Treasury.89\nThe Bishop of Mexico approved the plan proposed by G \u00e1lvez too; he \nconsidered the abusive behavior of alcaldes mayores to be the root of all evil \nof Spanish American government. Intendentes would \ufb01ll the gap between \nalcaldes mayores and viceroys. They were even more necessary than in Spain, \nwhere inhabitants of villages were more rational. Although he did not dwell \non more theoretical considerations, he did make reference to the conquest in order to stress the need to accommodate natives\u2019 lives to the conquerors\u2019 \nlaws and customs.\n90\nThe goal set by the Crown to regain control over power structures in the \nAmericas, in order to guarantee that justice be served and that all necessary \nr e s o u r c e st oe n f o r c ei t sA t l a n t i cp o l i c yb ee x t r a c t e d ,e n d e du p\u2013a si sw e l l  known \u2013 with G \u00e1lvez as Minister of the Indies, in an attempt to exclude \nCreoles from holding major political and judicial o ffices.\n91However, it is \none thing to have measures adopted in Court, and quite another to imple-ment them in America. In either case, it is clear that both the underlying discourse of most projects as well as the measures implemented in the second half of the 18th Century impaired the rights and interests of many \nAmerican elites. In both cases, a utilitarian vision of the Americas was gain-\ning momentum, which translated into a divergence between Monarchy and Nation. The Indies were part of the Monarchy\u2019s \u2013 but not of the Nation\u2019s \u2013 discourse.\n92\nIt was a process already under way. The loss of Spanish dominions in \nEurope a fter the War of Succession favored the \u201cnationalization\u201d of the \nMonarchy. Castile increasingly consolidated as its center and, consequently, a periphery started to develop. With the encouragement of the Court and the support of di fferent cultural groups, an interpretation of history inclined \nto identify Castile with Spain was evolving.\n93However, this process encoun-\n89 Ibid., 131.\n90 Report of 21 January 1768.

Garc\u00eda P\u00e9reztered resistance in certain territories, such as the Basque Provinces and the \nKingdom of Navarre \u2013 especially \u2013, which, since ancient times, had had their \nown laws, governmental and judicial institutions. Here also an alternative \ndiscourse of a constitutional nature emerged which, as would be the case in the Americas, tended to emphasize its \u201cseparation\u201d from Castile, that is, its essence as a perfect political community, whether as a province, dominion or kingdom.\nYet, the consequences of the establishment of a Spanish Nation partially \ndifferent from the Monarchy were not the same for Peninsular and oceanic \nterritories. Navarre and the Basque Provinces were still part of both, even though their rights and liberties, particularly in the \ufb01scal and military areas, \nwere increasingly challenged. Conversely, the Indies appeared more and \nmore as areas politically available to serve the interests of the Monarchy\u2019s \nprincipal Domain, namely the Nation. In this regard, it is no coincidence that one of the Ministers who, as prosecutor of the Council of Castile, had p l a y e dam o r ep r o m i n e n tr o l ei nt h ec o n \ufb02icts between the Kingdom of \nNavarre and the Court since 1770,\n94Pedro Rodr\u00edguez de Campomanes, \nwas also the author of one of the treatises that best featured the subordinate nature of the Indies to the Nation, to which \u2013 seemingly \u2013 they did not belong. This can be noted by merely reading the acknowledgment at the beginning of his treatise \u201c\nRe\ufb02exiones sobre el comercio espa\u00f1ol a Indias [Re\ufb02ec-\ntions on the Spanish Trade to Indias]\u201d .95\n94 I refer to the con \ufb02icts over levies and transfer of customs houses. In this context, Navarre \nwas forced to develop an elaborate constitutional discourse in defense of their \ufb01scal and \nmilitary rights and liberties. Allow me to refer you to G arc\u00eda P\u00e9rez (2008) 205\u2013262.\n95 To Campomanes, the decadence \u201cof our farmers and cra ftsmen is that there is no dispatch \nof the fruit of their work or cra ft, \u201d which damaged the strength of the Monarchy, based on \n\u201cits population and its trade. \u201d However, Campomanes wondered \u201cWho will believe, Sir, \nknowing that Your Majesty dominates the largest and best part of the Americas, where \nthere are many millions of Your Majesty\u2019s vassals, that these goods have no dispatch?\u201d The \nwork he presented was aimed at revealing the cause of this evil which \u2013 in the words of \nthe prosecutor of the Council of Castile \u2013 could only reside \u201cin the body of the Nation or \nin the rules hitherto observed on the tra ffic to and from the Indies. \u201d The problem was, \ni n d e e d ,i nt h er u l e s .T h et r a d eb a ni m p o s e d\u201c o nt h eA m e r i c a sp o r t si sf a rf r o ma d m i r a b l e  \n\u2013 he noted \u2013 as the Colonies should not have concurrent navigation with the matrix. But \nit is unprecedented for Spain to su ffer this exclusion. \u201d In this context, the Indies were not \nthe Nation, but colonies at its service. C ampomanes (1988) 3\u20134.\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 63The unequal condition of the Indies is similarly noticed in the well-\nknown projects developed by Intendente Jos\u00e9 \u00c1balos (1780), by the Count \nof Aranda (1783), and by the almighty Godoy (1804) \u2013 which was even \nknown and approved by Charles IV \u2013. All of them agreed on the conven-ience of dividing the Indies into several Monarchies led by members of the Spanish Royal Family.\n96Regardless of the feasibility of such proposals, the \nIndies were described as territories politically available to the Monarch. In \npractice, this was clear during Godoy\u2019s government with the transfer of \nSanto Domingo to France in 1795, and Louisiana and Trinidad to England in 1800 and 1802, respectively.\n97\nHowever, the key trigger for the creation of a discourse of colonial denun-\nciation was the crisis of the Monarchy a fter the entry of French troops into \nSpain and the abdication of the Spanish Monarchs in favor of Napoleon. The ensuing power vacuum and the di fferent solutions then defended provided \nthe perfect framework for the development of an anti-colonial discourse in the Americas. In this new and unforeseen context, the term\ncolony became \ninstrumental in the \ufb01ght between political projects on both sides of the \nAtlantic: within the Peninsula, in order to gain American support for the constitutional case in Cadiz and, in general, for the war of liberation against Napoleon; in the Americas, in order to support the di fferent projects for an \nautonomous government at \ufb01rst, and an independent one later on.\n98Thus, \nthe \u201ccolonial paradigm, \u201d to quote Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re, evolved, a paradigm which \nhas dominated the Latin American historiography so far.\nIII. Final Considerations\nIt is commonplace among historians to assert the need to understand ancient \nsocieties from their own interpretive categories. It is not an easy task. Some would consider this an illusive goal as temporal borders would make it i m p o s s i b l et oo v e r c o m ec u l t u r a lr u p t u r e s .W h i l et h e r ei sn on e e dt oe n g a g e  \n96 R amos P\u00e9rez (1968); M u\u00f1ozOr\u00e1n(1960); R odr\u00edguez (1976) 54\u201366; N avarro Garc\u00eda\n(1997).\n97 A paradigmatic expression of Godoy\u2019s declared colonial policy was the Board of Forti \ufb01ca-\ntions and Defense of the Indies, as has been pointed out by G arriga Acosta (2006) \n110\u2013120.\n98 O rtega (2011).\n64 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezin these theoretical rather than practical debates, no one questions how \nconvenient it is for a historian to avoid projecting into the past categories \nor concepts coined or re-elaborated in the present time to provide solutions \nto current world problems.99\nIn the case at hand, it is quite clear from what has been described in these \npages that, a fter their conquest and incorporation into Castile, the Indies \nbecame part of the Spanish universal Monarchy. The colonization model on \nwhich the Spanish based their conquests was not the one that predominated \nas from the second half of the 18th Century \u2013 and particularly during the 19th and 20th Centuries \u2013, used by the main European powers. Rather, at least ideally, it resembled the Roman model.\n100That is why, until the late \n18th Century the words colony andcolonize were understood both in diction-\na r i e sa n du s a g ea sw e l la si nl e g a lt e x t sa ss y n o n y m so f population and \npopulate .101In the second half of the past Century, the term colony acquired \nthe modern sense of economic exploitation both in the republic of letters as in \nthe European Courts.102\nThe ideal reference to the ancient colonization model does not preclude \nme from stating that the colonization of the Indies had particular or speci \ufb01c \nfeatures: by way of example, and among other factors, religion enjoyed a dominant though not exclusive role. It could not have been otherwise. Historical times were signi \ufb01cantly di fferent. In the 15th Century, the con-\nquest and colonization of the Americas also involved joining the Indies to \nCastile under an accessory union and, consequently, transferring the Castil-\nian legal order to the new lands. However, the di fferent treatment required \nby the New World over the years resulted in a progressive increase in its \n99 G addis (2002); W ood (2008).\n100 See P adgen (2005) chapter 1. Regarding the connection between liberalism and imperial-\nism in the mid nineteenth Century, see P itts (2006).\n101 \u201c Colony : a town or parcel of land that has been populated by foreign people taken from \nthe City which owns such territory or from some other place. The word colonies also \nmeant the places populated by their ancient inhabitants, who had been granted the priv-\nileges corresponding to such peoples by the Romans (\u2026). In Spain, there were many \ntowns that had been Roman colonies. \u201d C ovarrubias Orozco (1674) 154. The de \ufb01nition \nof the term \u201ccolony\u201d in the Diccionario de Autoridades de 1729 , 419, is practically the same. \nThis ancient meaning of the word colony also appears in Pol\u00edtica Indiana by S ol\u00f3rzano  \nPereira , as has been pointed out by T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 102\u2013103.\n102 L emp\u00e9ri\u00e8re (2004b) 114\u2013116.\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 65political identity as a territory distinct from Castile, though formally it was \nan accessory part of the latter. This particular or speci \ufb01c feature was re \ufb02ected \non the institutional level, with the creation of the Council of the Indies and the particular evolution of its\nAudiencias and its municipios , of Spaniards and \nof Indians, as well as in the legal sources, with the leading role of custom and the speci \ufb01city of the law of the Indies, paradigmatically represented in the \nRecopilaci\u00f3n [Compilation] of 1681. In this respect, the accessory nature of \nthe union gradually developed turning the Indies into a territory more similar to Navarre or Aragon than to other kingdoms joined to Castile under an accessory union, such as Granada or Murcia. At the same time, a creole discourse emerged \u2013 studied from this perspective by Garriga \u2013 that viewed Spanish America as a perfect community separate from Castile. The purpose \nwas to secure that o ffices to be held in the Indies were reserved for natives of \nthose lands and not for Spaniards.\n103\nThe Castilian estate-based social order, unevenly constituted, was also \ntransplanted to the New World but with some clear di fferences. In addition \nto the kings\u2019 policy of limiting jurisdictional dominions as much as possible, the integration of the indigenous peoples into this imported order posed not \nonly theoretical but, mainly, practical problems. Although indigenous peo-ples were considered \u201cmiserable people\u201d legally and, as such, subject to the Crown\u2019s protection, the consequences of such status were diverse, depending on the di fferent peoples, places and times. In addition, the degree of assim-\nilation of European culture and of the Catholic religion were also di fferent, \nas well as the transformations that the native cultures underwent. In any case, and despite the relationship of subordination and dependence that the conquest entailed for indigenous peoples, together with the numerous abu-\nses that, notwithstanding the Crown\u2019s protectionist policy, they su ffered in \nthese Centuries, the colonial relationship model \u2013 understood in its modern \nsense \u2013 does not seem to be the best suited to explain the place occupied by the Indies and their people within the Spanish Monarchy. In this respect, we agree with Tau when he posits the \u201cinappropriateness of the word\ncolony to \ndescribe generically the political condition of the Indies. \u201d No political entity in the Spanish Monarchy is referred to by that name in legal or political texts, in custom or in practice.\n104Moreover, the emergence of a colonial \n103 G arriga Acosta (2006) 72\u201393.\n104 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 121.\n66 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezpolitical discourse in the 18th Century and the adoption of measures reveal-\ning a colonial conception of the Indies did not result in a substantial trans-\nformation of the political model of the Spanish Monarchy. Therefore, from a \nhistoriographical perspective, it seems more accurate, and possibly more fruitful, to assume the legal categories used at the time to construct the Spanish American space. The Indies were provinces or kingdoms joined to the Crown of Castile under an accessory union. Henceforth, it is the duty of \nhistorians to determine the concrete meaning of these categories in each \nhistorical period, avoiding the use of schemes that are too rationalist and anachronistic to comprehend a reality which then, just as now, was beyond any simplistic approach to systematization.\nOn the other hand, adopting perspectives that assume a plurality of con-\ncurrent powers and jurisdictions in Spanish America, leaving aside mental structures too bound to state standards, can provide a more realistic approach to the relationships between the Crown and the New World. From this perspective, the leading role that indigenous peoples \u2013 with their rights and traditions \u2013 played in the creation of the Spanish American legal order \nshould also be acknowledged. Without underestimating the signi \ufb01cance of \nthe policies the head of the Monarchy pursued, through the Council of the \nIndies,\nJuntas [Boards] or the Secretariats of State, the fact that they were \nfocused on the places where the di fferent social actors converged \u2013 mainly \ncities and towns \u2013 evidences the inappropriateness of explaining political \nsocieties of the Old Regime too \ufb02atly or homogeneously.105In this area, \ndominated by the existence of patronage or family networks, or by the \ninteraction of groups having diverse interests which, on many occasions, joined the two sides of the Atlantic, it is not su fficient to apply general \nbinary schemes, such as Peninsular-Creole or Spanish-Indian. Also in this context, the simple opposition colonizer-colonized can leave a substantial part of the human relationships typical of the Old Regime in the Americas outside our attentional focus.\nFinally, as is the case with the word \u201cState, \u201d whether it is appropriate to \nuse the term \u201ccolony\u201d will ultimate ly depend on the meanings and conno-\n105 On the need to study the history of the Nation in Spain and also of the Americas from \nthis municipal perspective rather than from the history of the kingdoms or of the forma-\ntion of the State, an author who has attracted attention, among others, is Tamar Herzog. \nA good example of the possibilities of this approach is H erzog (2003).\nRevisiting the America\u2019s Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 67tations the historian gives it. In this respect, it is possible to use the word \ncolony orcolonial while preserving the political logic characteristic of the \nSpanish Monarchy during the Old Regime. We would be dealing, in any \ncase, with not very \u201ccolonial\u201d colonies.\nBibliography\nAcerca del t\u00e9rmino \u201ccolonia\u201d (1954), [sesi\u00f3n cient\u00ed\ufb01 ca 26 de enero y 22 de febrero \n1954], Instituto Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo, Madrid: Consejo Superior de \nInvestigaciones Cient\u00ed\ufb01 cas\n\u00c1lvarez -Ossorio Alvari \u00f1o,Antonio ,Bernardo J.

The Questions\nIn 1648, analyzing the titles that Spain may have to the New World, Sol\u00f3r-\nzano Pereira advanced the theory that these depended on its vassals \ufb01rst \nhaving \u201csearched, found and occupied\u201d the territory.

The original version reads: \n\u201cy verdaderamente para las islas y tierras que hallaron por ocupar y poblar de otras gentes, \no ya porque nunca antes las hubiesen habitado o porque si las habitaron se pasaron a otras \ny las dejaron incultas, no se puede negar que lo sea y de los m\u00e1s conocidos por el derecho \nn a t u r a lyd et o d a sl a sg e n t e s ,q u ed i e r o ne s t ep r e m i oai n d u s t r i ayq u i s i e r o nq u el ol i b r e  cediese a los que primero lo hallasen y ocupasen y as\u00ed se fue practicando en todas las \nprovincias del mundo, como a cada paso nos lo ense\u00f1a Arist\u00f3teles, Cicer\u00f3n, nuestros \njurisconsultos y sus glosadores\u201d and \u201clos lugares desiertos e incultos quedan en la libertad \nnatural y son del que primero los ocupa en premio de su industria. \u201d In the seventeenth \ncentury, \u201cindustria\u201d was identi \ufb01ed as \u201cthe diligence and easiness in which one does some-\nthing with less work than others. \u201d With a comparative perspective in mind, it designated those who knew better and performed better: C ovarruias Orozco (1995), 666. It is \npossible, however, that by the mid-eighteenth century it came to designate simply \u201ca \nmastery or an ability in any art or profession:\u201d Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola (1732), Dicciona-\nrio de la lengua castellana, 258.\nDid European Law Turn American?\n75they had now acquired title.2This entitlement, Locke argued, harmed no \none. After all, a land that had been abandoned or was insu fficiently culti-\nvated was a land that no one truly needed. Applying this theory to the \nAmericas, Locke concluded that, because Native-Americans did not improve the land (nor did they mix their industry with it), they had no title to it, nor could they prohibit its occupation and use by others.\nBy 1758, both these theories were enshrined as doctrines of the Law of \nNations (and thus of nascent international law). Emmer de Vattel, who had reproduced them in his recompilation, also insisted that cultivating the land was an obligation imposed upon man by nature, that all nations were bound by natural law to labor the territory that they occupied, and that those who did not \u201cfailed in their duty to themselves, injured their neighbors and \ndeserved to be exterminated like wild beasts of prey. \u201d No one, he concluded, \ncould \u201ctake to themselves more land than they have need of or can inhabit and cultivate, \u201d and no one \u201cmay complain if other more industrious nations, too con\ufb01ned at home, should come and occupy part of their land. \u201d\n3\nMost scholars have assumed that these developments marked an Ameri-\ncan addition to European (now also international) law. They pointed out that both Sol\u00f3rzano and Locke were deeply engaged in the \u201cEuropean Expansion, \u201d and both sought to legitimate what their countries were doing overseas. While Sol\u00f3rzano was a colonial judge working in Lima, Locke was a lawyer that, although living in the Old Continent, represented colonial \ninterests.\n4Vattel, who had made these theories part of a coherent body of \nlaw, may have had no commitment to colonialism per se, but his dedication \nto both philosophy and diplomacy geared him to search for a clear statement of what he thought was (or ought to be) the legal norms of his time. Scholars \nhave also insisted that these developments demonstrated the contribution of \nthe Americas to the consolidation of private property. It was \ufb01rst in the \nAmericas, they sustained, that property was not only sancti \ufb01ed, but was also \nmade a-historical.\n5\nPart of a transatlantic conversation taking place in the seventeenth and \neighteenth centuries, these conclusions serve here as an excuse to examine \n2John Locke , Two Treatises of Government, second treatise, chapter 5, points 27\u201351, espe-\ncially points 31\u201332.\n3Vattel (1916), book I, chapters VIII and XVIII, 37\u201338 and 85\u201386.\n4Arneil (1996) and A rmitage (2004).\n5Larkin (1969), 1\u201352.\n76 Tamar Herzogthe relations between Early Modern European and American law. We \nalready know that European law crossed the Atlantic and, in the process, \nalso gained ground as an international law of sorts. We also know that it was \nconstructed in a multilog between various actors working from di fferent \nnational traditions. But to what degree was this European law American-ized? Was there, indeed, a\nderecho indiano, as Spanish scholars have named \nthe process of European law having gone native?\nI suggest looking at these questions by observing both sides of the Ocean, \ncentering not on how these theories had evolved, but instead on how some of their tenants were de facto implemented in both the Old and the New world.\nII. The Spanish-American Observatory\nIdeas linking use (mainly cultivation) to rights were clear in Spanish Amer-ica as early as the sixteenth century, and they mainly operated to justify native dispossession. Although not necessarily codi \ufb01ed in law books and \nregulations, they nevertheless found ample expression in court decisions that declared certain lands as occupied and thus belonging to the native inhab-itants and others as vacant and thus open for colonization. The jurisdiction of the\naudiencia of Quito (present day Ecuador and southern Colombia) may \nserve as an example. Studying land litigation in Quito clari \ufb01es that, follow-\ning royal instructions, Spanish judges were willing to recognize the right of native communities to the \u201cland of their ancestors. \u201d\n6However, they also \nauthorized a gradual process that led to native dispossession, which histor-ians have since lamented.\n7\nAs I have argued elsewhere in greater detail, recognition of ancestral \nrights did not guarantee continuity.8Instead, it introduced major changes \nin the way native rights were both de \ufb01ned and defended. The reason for this \nmutation was simple: Indigenous communities who wanted their right to land recognized by the Spaniards had to address the colonial courts. In \nQuito, at least, these courts responded to these claims by examining whether \n6M ariluz Urquijo (1978) 24\u201327.

Rather than examining old entitlements, they proceeded to verify factors such as residence and continuous use. In most cases, they equated \u201cuse\u201d with agricultural pursuits, both planting and pasturing. Gath-\nering was sometimes also described as a legitimate activity giving rights to \nthe territory. Hunting, on the contrary, never was. Spanish judges thus asked who was present on the land, what they were doing and not what title they held. They favored sedentary communities over others who used the terri-tories in other ways and, subjecting rights to \u201cactual use, \u201d they required that \nall natives continuously use the land, arguing that unless they did, territory \ncould never be recognized as their own.\nThe accumulation of all these factors guaranteed that in the process of \n\u201crecognizing indigenous right to land\u201d the Spaniards profoundly trans-formed these rights; eliminating many that may have existed during the \npre-colonial period, they created and gave others that were completely \nnew. The judges, however, were only complementing what the king was doing too. During the colonial period, the Crown routinely distributed land to new or resettled indigenous communities.\n10Yet, in all these cases, land \ngranted to natives was not considered their own. According to the law, this \nland was royal property ( realengo ) and it was to remain in native hands only \n9 Documentation regarding land claims in the audiencia of Quito was mostly found in the \nNational Archives of Ecuador/Quito (herea fter ANQ), sections titled cacicazgo, tierra, \nfondo especial, casas and gobierno. Additional documentation proceeds from the Spanish \ncolonial archives in Seville (Archivo General de Indias, herea fter AGI) and the Biblioteca \nde la Real Academia de la Historia in Madrid (herea fter BRAH/M). See, for example, the \nquestionaire submitted by don Juan Zumba cacique de Uyumbicho, Quito 28/8/1565, ANQ, Tierras 1, exp. 1 de 14/8/1565, fols. 12r\u201313r on 12v and the royal provision to the \ncorregidor of R\u00edobamba, Quito, 16/8/1649, ANQ, Ind\u00edgenas 16, exp. 2 de 2/9/1686, fols. \n1r\u20134r, on fol. 2r.\n10 H erzog (2007).

Subjected to a \u201cright of return\u201d (\nderecho de reversi\u00f3n )i nc a s eo fn o n - u s e( o ri n s u fficient use), all land granted \nto indigenous communities was thus conditional. Under continuous scru-tiny, the Spaniards \u2013 both litigants and judges \u2013 periodically questioned \nwhether the original grant was justi \ufb01ed and whether, at the present, the \ncommunity still needed the land. Extremely powerful during the periodical \nexamination of land titles called\ncomposiciones , the tying of rights to (su ffi-\ncient) use, became the most powerful mechanism of native dispossession.12\nEchoing what Sol\u00f3rzano, Locke and Vattel had described, it mandated a \nnew moral economy according to which land should be the property not \nof those who had it \ufb01rst but instead of those who could work and use it \nbetter.\nThe legal reasoning that Sol\u00f3rzano, Locke,Vattel, and the judges of Quito \nfollowed to justify the dispossession of Indigenous peoples by arguing their \nneglect to work the land su fficiently could also operate vis-\u00e0-vis European \npowers.This was clearly the case in the Spanish-Portuguese borderland in the \nAmerican interior. Although the Spaniards and Portuguese invoked papal bulls and bilateral treaties in their relationship with one another, the histor-ical documentation generated on the border itself demonstrates that both \nparties were mostly obsessed with the question who was where and what \nthey were doing.\n13Discovery and exploration \u2013 that is, the initial and early \narrival to the territory \u2013 were important in such discussions regarding land \n11 Petition of the protector de indios , Quito 9/11/1791, ANQ, Cacicazgo 3, exp. 3 de 9/11/\n1791, fol. 3r, ANQ, Ind\u00edgenas 1, exp. 3 de 13/12/1597 and \u201cprovisi\u00f3n real a petici\u00f3n del \nprotector general en nombre de Antonio Amaguano cacique de Nayon, \u201d ANQ, cacicazgo \n44, vol. 99, 23/2/1732, fol. 3r\u2013v.

They sent their respective monarchs reports about their progr ess, and they \u201cauthenticated\u201d (\nautenticar ) \ntheir claims by conducting judicial investigations and collecting oral decla-rations.\n15\nBecause rights depended on acutal use of the land, the territorial posses-\nsion that resulted was o ften discontinuous. Made of \ufb01elds, farms, woods or \nsettlements, entitlements took the form of an archipelago, with \u201cislands\u201d of \noccupation and use surrounded by a \u201csea\u201d of \u201cunoccupied land, \u201d as well as \ncorridors and routes connecting them.16And, while the territory in between \noccupied parcels was open for appropriation, how to de\ufb01ne the islands already used became a major concern. The nucleated nature of the territory that the Spaniards and the Portuguese both possessed came into focus, for \nexample, during discussions involving Colonia de Sacramento (in present \nday Uruguay). Colonia was built, destroyed, rebuilt, taken again, and returned once more, on several occasions during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While discussants in Europe referred to it as a solid, clear unit, this clarity dissipated in the Americas. What did Colonia consist \nof ? Was it equal to the territory of its fort?

They had to ensure that the territory they pretended was theirs would be constantly used and re-used; but they also had to certify that their rivals shied away from it, as well as from any new area. If the rivals \ndid not, expressing protest was crucial because the lack of a response could \nbe legally constructed and comprehended (by way of legal presumption) as consent.\nCon\ufb02ict regarding use, however, was not limited to land. Both the Span-\niards and the Portuguese understood that controlling the local population \nwas a means to control the territory. Distinguishing natives according to \ntheir degree of hostility to them and their potential for \u201cdomestication, \u201d Europeans also classi \ufb01ed them according to whether they were \u201cinclined\u201d \nto one country or the other.\n18In the process, natives, too, became objects to \nbe possessed (or \u201cused\u201d). Not only did Europeans try to convert those who \nwere their enemies into their allies or ensure (when they failed) their anni-\nhilation, they were also constantly suspicious of what their native \u201cfriends\u201d may do.\n19They believed that those who had reached an \u201cunderstanding\u201d \nwith them could turn into foes and ally with their rivals.

The Portuguese did the same.21Complaining that \u201cvassals of Spain\u201d \nconvinced Indians inclined to their friendship to attack them, they circulated \nrumors that indicated that several such natives might have even joined the \nSpaniards in the e ffort to expel the Portuguese.22\nIn the process, the inhabitants of both powers portrayed Indian allies as \ntheir property.23Perhaps not quite \u201ctheirs\u201d as the land was considered to be, \nbut not so drastically di fferent; these Indians, they argued, were already in \ntheir \u201cpossession\u201d(sic) and could therefore not become the property of another.

Making \nthe cultivation of the land also a religious duty, they insisted that property was supposed to advance, not diminish, public utility. In Spain, these visions were dominant during the\nReconquista , allowing individuals and commun-\nities to obtain title to land, which others had allegedly abandoned or insuf-\n\ufb01ciently worked.36They were also continuously invoked in the sixteenth and \nseventeenth century by arbitristas who insisted on the obligation of kings to \nreward those who cultivated the land by giving them title to it, and to \npunish those who did not by forcing them to either use the land or surren-der it.\n37\nThe clearest example of how in early modern Spain, too, use and rights \nwere closely related is that of the repopulation campaigns carried out in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\n38These campaigns, which identi \ufb01ed \nthe depopulation of the country as one of the major reasons for its economic decline, advocated the need to use vacant territories (\ndespoblados )a n d ,a b o v e  \nall, to resettle those places that were once cultivated. In the eyes of many, these depopulated areas incarnated Spain\u2019s problems. Having once been \u201cuseful, \u201d they became \u201cwaste\u201d . To reverse these tendencies, royal action was necessary. The king had to force those who possessed\ndespoblados to cultivate \nthem or allow others to do so.\nRepopulation campaigns, particularly prominent in the late seventeenth \nand eighteenth centuries, caused major social upheaval.39While those who \nwanted access to land pressured royal delegates to translate royal orders into \n34 Roman law may have authorized the seizure of uncultivated land ( agri deserti )i no r d e r  \nto guarantee that it would be worked and taxes would be paid on them: C oncha y\nMart\u00ednez (1946) 139\u2013144.

As a result, \nrepopulation campaigns o ften degenerated into long discussions involving \nmunicipalities, proprietors and hopeful colonists. At stake were classi \ufb01catory \nquestions, mainly, which territories were depopulated or insu fficiently used. \nAlso debated was what was the land\u2019s true potential and who was best suited \nto pursue its improvement. Given these conditions, seventeenth- and eight-eenth-century repopulation campaigns are a good starting point for under-\nstanding the relationship, in Peninsular Spain between land and use, use and \nrights.\nRepopulation campaigns made two issues clear. First, most individuals \nand groups who requested permission to cultivate a territory, which they considered empty or insu fficiently used, usually argued that pasture, when \narable agriculture was possible, was a waste.\n40According to them, grazing \ndid not improve the land, nor did it ensure that its potential would be met. Land dedicated to pasture was not only wasteful, it was also dangerous. Uncultivated and le ftin a state of nature, it served as refuge for dangerous \npeople and wild animals, even disease.\n41Leaving land in this barren state, \nthey argued, was never an informed decision. On the contrary, it was mainly due to neglect, willful and at times even criminal.\n42\nIf the \ufb01rst point of almost general agreeme nt was criticism of grazing, the \nsecond was the allegation that improving the land by making it achieve its (true) potential was not a choice but an obligation. Tying the reform of land \nto the reform of its people, improvement would ensure that, through access \nto land, poor vagabonds would be transformed into responsible, law-abiding individuals.\n43Improvement would also guarantee the domestication of \nnature itself: uncultivated land became arid to the point of no return.44\n40 AHN, Consejos 4057, fol. 1r\u20134r and 6r.\n41 The report written by Pablo de Olavide, Seville, 20/11/1773, AHN, Consejos 4048, \nfols. 6r\u20139r and AHN, Consejos 4061, no. 15, fols. 30r\u201336r.\n42 Contemporary documentation does clarify, however, that some \ufb01elds may have been \nabandoned as a result of the \u201cdi fficulties of the time, \u201d epidemic outbreaks, or foreign \noccupation: AHN, Consejos 4047 and petition of the \u201clugares de las valles de Broto y Tena \u2026\u201d undated, Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid (herea fter BNE) VE/200/11.\n43 Petition of Manuel Rodr\u00edguez, Madrid, 23/11/1798, AHN, Consejos 4061 n. 2 and AHN, \nConsejos 4061 n. 13, fols. 6r\u20139r.\n44 A rriquibar (1779) 238\u2013239 and la Real Sociedad Matritense de Amigos del Pa\u00eds en 1780 \naccording to: Archives of the Real Sociedad Matritense de Amigos del Pa\u00eds (herea fter \nRSMAP) 37/1.\n86 Tamar HerzogCultivating the land was deemed a patriotic activity as the re-conquest of \nbarren terrain, some argued, was \u201cmore glorious, useful and secure than the \nconquest of distant lands. \u201d45\nWho was best suited to reform the land was another debated issue. Land-\nlords tended to argue that the poor certainly were not. A fter all, even if they \ndid not lack experience as laborers, the y certainly lacked the knowledge, the \nmeans and the tools necessary to improve the land.46Settlers who were \n\u201crefugees and beggars\u201d ( pr\u00f3fugos y mendigos ) were equally unsuitable.47Col-\nonizers, therefore, should be of adequate age, economic stature and educa-tion.\n48In short, intention to improve the land was perhaps a necessary but \ncertainly not a su fficient condition. Furthermore, those wishing to become \ncolonizers were to have a true \u201cvocation. \u201d They would have to have a true \ninterest in improving the land (not only in acquiring possession of it), and \nthey would also have to prove that they were capable of carrying out what they promised.\n49\nAlthough repopulation campaigns did not always involve property rights \n\u2013 in many campaigns colonists would have to pay fees to landlords, who \nwould maintain their property \u2013, on most occasions, (proper) use was to \nlead (eventually) to rights. One popular way to attract colonists, for example, was precisely the promise to transfer land rights a fter a certain period. With-\nout such an outlook, it was feared, nothing would be achieved.\n50And, if \nimprovement gave title to land \u2013 if not immediately, at least eventually \u2013, the \n45 The original version reads: \u201cun reino podr\u00eda formarse de s\u00f3lo estos desiertos espantosos y \nsu reconquista ser\u00eda m\u00e1s gloriosa, \u00fatil y segura, que la de pa\u00edses distantes:\u201d A rriquibar\n(1779) 235.

This could \nhappen, contemporaries argued, because owners who did not cultivate their \nland had no rights at all. A fter all, they received the land under the condition \nthat they would use it, and their failure to do so was su fficient to justify \nrepossession and redistribution of the land. In the words of a contemporary observer: \u201cFor centuries, these lands have been fruitless. Their owners did not \nhave, nor have at the present, nor can have in them any utility other than \nwhat they could have in possessions situated in imaginary spaces. \u201d\n51What \nwas also helpful was the conviction that, on these occasions, the king could intervene in the existing legal order and both relinquish and create rights. This, it was argued, was the meaning of sovereignty: the king\u2019s superior and \neminent domain over all the land allowed him to distribute it according to \npublic need, denying certain (existing) privileges and creating others anew.\nGiven this background, it is not surprising that, by the eighteenth cen-\ntury, like Sol\u00f3rzano, Locke and Vattel, Spanish authors also identi \ufb01ed work \nwith property.\n52They argued that labor, rather than land, produced riches \nand they reasoned that progress required allowing individuals to pro\ufb01tf r o m  the fruits of their labor. However, Sp ain was not the only European country \nin which these issues played a major role during the seventeenth and eight-eenth centuries. England, where Locke wrote his essays, is another example.\nFrom as early as the sixteenth century and more clearly in the three \nfollowing centuries, the English countryside underwent a profound trans-formation.\n53Although historians have disagreed about its origin, develop-\nment and results, they have all coincided that during this period many lands previously considered public were made private through a process that they \ntermed \u201cenclosure. \u201d According to them, economic pressures led to the fenc-\ning of lands, on the one hand, which demanded a more e fficient usage, on \nthe other.\n54Contemporary, was a new ideology that connected property to \n51 The original version reads: \u201cpues ni han tenido ni tienen ni pueden tener por el orden \nregular en ellas m\u00e1s utilidad, que lo que pudieran \ufb01gurarse en unas posesiones situadas en \nlos espacios imaginarios. \u201d A rriquibar (1779) 236.\n52 J ovellanos (1795) 8 and 12\u201313.\n53 S later (1907) and T awney (1965).\n54 This mixing of elements eventually allowed authors such as Grotius and Locke to consider \nthe lack of enclosure a sign of absence of improvement and thus the lack of title or \nproperty: A rneil (1996) 62.\n88 Tamar Herzogimprovement, arguing that only those su fficiently knowledgeable and capa-\nble of making the land truly pro \ufb01t a b l es h o u l db ea l l o w e dt oh o l di t .T i e dt o  \nthe commercialization of agriculture and to a general attack on both public \nand communal land-holding (making private property a social and political ideal), these processes led to the dispossession of many individuals, families and communities, converting them from small peasants into landless agri-cultural (and eventually industrial) wage workers.\nAlthough these developments gradually gained strength, until the eight-\neenth century enclosure, at least, it was a controversial measure that many criticized.\n55They debated its political, economic, social and legal wisdom \nand asked whether it was bene \ufb01cial, to whom, and to what extent. Defenders \nof these policies insisted that they guaranteed the \u201ccommon good\u201d because \nthey supplied the country with more food (the assumption was that \ufb01elds \nbetter used would produce more) but also because they would reform the \npeasant and the poor, leading the country from \u201cbackwardness\u201d to \u201cmod-ernity. \u201d Identifying enclosure and the privatization of land with its \u201cimprove-ment, \u201d such actors sustained that this was the only means of encouraging \ninvestment and innovation. Labor was central to this debate as it was \nassumed that the state of agriculture depended on human action, not natural conditions.\n56Portrayed as an activity confronting man with nature rather \nthan with other men, improvement (and the subsequent appropriation it entailed) were thus considered a heroic struggle against territories \u2013 for \nexample, grazing grounds \u2013 still in a \u201cstate of nature. \u201d\n57By the end of this \nprocess, the call to improve the land was couched as a religious duty to \ntransform chaotic nature into a domesticated garden.\nThe argument supporting enclo sure and improvement justi \ufb01ed the trans-\nfer of property from those \u201cunworthy\u201d to those who would use it \u201ccorrectly. \u201d Yet, if in theory, it could undermine not only the rights of communities to their common lands and the poor to their own, but also endanger the entitlements of wealthy landowners who did not use their properties su ffi-\nciently, such was not the case.\n58As happened in the Americas, in practice, \nthis powerful discourse was mainly applied to some sectors and to them \n55 N eeson (1993).\n56 A rneil (1996) 96\u2013103.\n57 L arkin (1969) 1\u20132 and B race (1998) 161\u2013162.\n58 W eaver (2004) 80\u201382.\nDid European Law Turn American? 89alone. It was as if the inherent assumption \u2013 almost never questioned \u2013 was \nthat collective and poor was the same as bad use, whereas individualistic and \nwealthy equaled good. These presumptions allowed continuous scrutinizing \nand criticizing of the \ufb01rst, yet no real attempt to measure the performance of \nthe second. Put diff erently, rather than being based on a case-to-case analysis \n(as the theory may have suggested), asking in each case what was the true potential of each section of land and how it could be improved and by \nwhom, certain stereotypes supplied an automatic response that while under-\nmining the rights of certain sectors, defended those of others.\nBy the eighteenth century, the literature that criticized the English poor \nand English communities for insu fficiently attending to their land compared \nthe members of these European groups to Native- Americans. Sometimes \nimplicitly, others explicitly, it argued that it made equal sense to dispossess \none and the other.\n59After all, both the English poor and the American \nIndians were \u201cbackward, \u201d and both hindered \u201cprogress. \u201d It is also possible that practices in England informed behavior in the colonies. Not only because enclosure and improvement were \ufb01rst used in Ireland against the \nlocal inhabitants, not only because John Locke may have been inspired by developments in the Old World in order to elaborate his theories regarding the colonies, but mainly because there is evidence that English peasants who experienced dispossession at home ended up replicating it vis-\u00e0-vis natives, whose property they coveted and whom they could accuse of insu fficiently \nworking the land.\n60\nIV . Conclusions\nIn the Americas as in Europe, by the late sixteenth century and clearly in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the right to land was tied to its \u201cprop-er use. \u201d What proper use meant could be endlessly debated, but it was clearly the case that in both England and Spain, as well as in the Old and the New \n59 N eeson (1993) 30 and B race (2001) 16\u201317. According to B race (1998) 164, \u201cThe virtuous \ndisciplined improver was de \ufb01ned not only in contrast to the property-less and wasteful \nhunter-gatherer in America, but also as directly opposed to the ungodly, undisciplined \nand unemployed in England. \u201d On how improvement became an imperial policy see \nDrayton (2000).\n60 B uck (2001) 47.\n90 Tamar HerzogWorld, these adjectives were mostly applied generically to certain activities \nof certain people, who were stereotyped as wasteful or, at least, not as su ffi-\nciently active or informed as to transform \u201cdeserts\u201d into fertile gardens.61\nThe road leading from criticism to criminalization was short but meaning-ful. By the end of this process, not only were some Native- American and Europeans dispossessed, but this dispossession was presented as their own fault. It was a punishment of sorts for their own neglect, a means to force \nthem to improve their ways and become \u201cmodern. \u201d\nAlthough commonalities existed, so did di fferences. Improvement was \nseen as an individualistic endeavor in England; in Spain and overseas it \nhad stronger communal overtones as many believed that it would only happen through the formation of new or the conservation of old commun-\nities. Yet, despite these di fferences, and the fact that property was not always \nimmediately transformed in Spain, eventually in all three places (England, \nSpain, and Spanish America) indigenous communal property ended up in the hands of individual outsiders.\nOne feature that tied all these questions together was the constant debate \nunleashed on both sides of the Ocean on how to reorganize land regimes in ways that seemed more \u201creasonable\u201d to contemporaries. Whether \u201creason-ableness\u201d was the motive or the excuse we will never know \u2013 it is probable that both were equally present \u2013 but, regardless, it is clear that rather than debating titles and historical rights, what contemporaries did was to discuss \nhow to change them, how to undermine them, or how to relinquish them \naltogether. It was as if they were willing to reinvent the social contract and the legal basis for ownership by putting a new spin on existing theories. This was an important development within a society (still) marked by tradition \nand in which, for centuries, the right to land depended on the passage of \ntime. Now, instead of \u201chistorical rights\u201d what mattered was a certain \u201cpublic utility. \u201d Historical amnesia, in short, was equally present on both sides of the Ocean, although its results may have di ffered according to place and time. \nTabula rasa was not an American invention; it was tied to a process we now \nidentify as \u201cmodernity. \u201d\n61 It is thus debatable whether England had indeed developed a particular discourse that, \ncontrary to other European nations, focused \u201con the possession of territory to the exclu-\nsion of its inhabitants\u201d and had passed from judging ownership and cohabitation to \nevaluating use: T omlins (2010) 132\u2013134.\nDid European Law Turn American? 91Insistence on the present rather than the past, however, may have been \nparticularly useful in the Americas, as it allowed ignoring the rights of \nprevious occupiers; nonetheless, it was also powerful in Europe. Tied to \nthe growing notion of sovereignty and royal responsibility, it imagined a modernizing upper class leading the rest of humanity (mainly indigenous peoples and the poor) to \u201cprogress. \u201d Rather than Americanized, law was modernized. The Americas, in short, may have accentuated European \ndebates on what occupation and proper usage were, but they did not invent \nthem, nor did they clearly depart from existing notions as experimentation took place on both sides of the Ocean contemporaneously.\nThe inability to distinguish European from American developments was \none feature of this modernization process. Although some institutions, laws \nand doctrines found a more fertile ground on one side of the Atlantic versus \nthe other, the constant dialog between both and the continuous in \ufb02ux of \nideas and practices made these worlds to some degree united. Practices experimented in Europe were implemented in the Americas, while also in\ufb02uencing the Old World. Success or failure in one could be detrimental \nto the experiment on the other side, but exact genealogies are hard, perhaps even impossible, to establish. On certain occasions, the Americas appeared almost as a platform on which ideas about Europe were debated. On others, it was a cause and a reason to reconsider old truths. But whatever the precise dynamics may have been, this continuous conversation ensured that the law \nconstantly changed. Under the guise of continuity, it mutates according to \nplace, time and circumstances.\n62And, although innovations could be the \nresult of an encounter with new circumstances, more oft en than not and as \nusually happens with law and legal change, they included new visions and \nnew ways of interpreting the existing canon.\n62 M ariluz Urquijo (1976) 389\u2013402.\n92 Tamar HerzogBibliography\nAdorno ,Rolena (2007), The Polemics of Possession in Spanish American narrative, \nNew Haven\nAmado Gonz\u00e1lez ,Donato (1998), Reparto de tierras ind\u00edgenas y la primera visita y \ncomposici\u00f3n general, 1591\u20131595, in: Hist\u00f3rica 22,2, 197\u2013207\nArmitage ,David (2004), John Locke, Carolina and the Two Treatises of Govern-\nment, in: Political Theory 32,5, 602\u2013627\nArneil ,Barbara (1996), John Locke and America.

Period Introduction: Legal Globalization in the Early Modern\nEuropean law was the primary vehicle and export product of early modern \nglobalization. European law spread with the Spaniards to Central and South America, and the Philippines; with the Portuguese to Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Goa, and Macao; with the Dutch to Ceylon and Indonesia; \nwith the French to Quebec and Louisiana; with the British to North Amer-\nica, Australia, and countless other p laces around the world; and even with \nthe Danes to the islands of St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix.\nExpansion was nothing new to European law at the outset of the modern \nage. European law had already expanded continuously\npari passu with the \ne x p a n s i o no ft h eR o m a nE m p i r e ,a n da g a i na fter Roman law was revived in \nlate eleventh century Bologna. The medieval expansion had meant that the learned bodies of law, Roman and canon, traveled from the southern parts of Europe to the north, from the western parts to the east, and from the \ncities to the countryside. Roman law traveled with the learned jurist, canon \nlaw with the Catholic Church and its churchmen.\n2\n1Sol\u00f3rzano y Pereyra (1648) IV .XVI.3, 260. I have modernized the spelling in the quote.\n2 O nt h ee x p a n s i o no ft h el a ww i t h i nm e d i e v a lE u r o p e ,s e eW hitman (2009).\nThe Westernization of Police Regulation 97To portray European law as a vehicle of globalization may seem Euro-\ncentered. It is of course true that European law has not been the only body of \nlaw expanding in the pre-modern world. Islamic law went through a period \nof rapid expansion from the seventh century onwards. The solutions that the Islamic legal experts had developed, building on the heritage of the Semitic cultures of the Near East, were quickly absorbed not only in the cradle of the religion for commercial needs, but also in large areas of North Africa and \nCentral Asia, to where Islam spread.\n3Chinese law, especially the Confucian \nconcept of li, has traditionally exercised in \ufb02uence in large areas of the Far \nEast.4The same questions that I will ask about European law in this article \ncould certainly be asked of Islamic and Chinese laws as well. However, it \nremains fairly clear that of all of these expanding laws of the medieval and \nearly modern periods European law had m ost success in extending its sphere \nof in\ufb02 uence around the globe, at least measured by sheer geography.\nThe term globalization, irritating s l o g a na si th a sb e c o m ef o rm a n y ,c a nb e  \ncalled into question. No globalization has so far been complete in geograph-\nical terms \u2013 not even the present-day iteration based mainly on the law of the \nUnited States of America. Large tracts of the globe have always been le ft \nuntouched, and even the picture of large tracts being completely dominated \nby extending bodies of law may prove misleading on closer inspection \u2013 and indeed almost always does. The learned\nius commune applied in the emerging \nhigh courts of Europe in the early modern period was not the same as the \nlaw applied in remote local courts dominated by unlearned laymen.5The \ndifference is naturally even clearer if one compares the audiencias of Spanish \nAmerica to the jungles of Amazonia.\nDespite the unquestionable de \ufb01ciencies in the terminology, globalization \nis still a useful term. It expresses huge waves of legal transfers, as opposed to \nmere isolated legal institutions, not linked to any wholesale cultural transfer, \ufb02oating around the globe. The dimensio ns of legal transfer are certainly \ncompletely di fferent if we take the Swedish-Danish institution of the\nom-\nbudsman as an example of an isolated legal transfer, comparing it with whole \n3 On the early expansion of Islam and its connection to the preceding cultures of the Near \nEast, see H allaq (2005) 8\u201328.\n4 Chongko Choi even speaks of East Asian ius commune; see Choi (2009).\n5 Sweden is the particular case I have in mind.\n98 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kibodies of law being taken from one continent to another. We need to have a \nname for the larger phenomenon, and legal globalization is such a name.\nLegal globalization, however, is not more than a huge legal transfer, and is \nsubject to similar theoretical ponderings as the more limited legal transfers. It is a truism that all transfers change when adapted to new circumstances, and the new outcome looks di fferent than the old one. The \u201creceiving\u201d \nculture and its new circumstances unavoidably in \ufb02uences the shape that \nthe transfer takes. Comparative law scholars and comparative legal historians have written extensively on the material aspects of legal transplants: what rules are carried over and borrowed by other jurisdictions and how legal rules change in this process. However, comparative legal historians have written surprisingly little on the conditions which cause transplants to \nchange and, accordingly, how they change. The methods of legal change \nthemselves can sometimes be understood as legal transfer, however. The main contention of this article is that both the Spanish and the British colonizers of America made ample use of one such technique, early modern police regulations. The spread of police regulation to the New World led to \nglobalization or at least thorough Westernization of this legal instrument.\nPolice regulations were, not however, merely a technique. Although they \ncovered a wide array of regulations, they did not cover everything. Police \nregulations were about administration, commerce, security, health, and cen-sorship, but they were much less about contract law, rules of evidence, or \npunishment.\nI will start with some theoretical considerations regarding the concepts of \nEuropean and Spanish colonial law (Section II). Section III, the main part of \nthe article, will discuss the main themes in regard to which Spanish colonial \nlaw developed di fferent solutions in comparison with its peninsular Spanish \nlegal order(s). In Section IV , I will then attempt to explain these di fferences, \ncomparing Spanish colonial law with that of the British North American \ncolonies. Section V sums up the essential points of the article.\nThe Westernization of Police Regulation 99II. Globalization of Law\nWilliam Twining de \ufb01nes globalization as \u201cthose processes which tend to \ncreate and consolidate a world economy, a single ecological system, and a \ncomplex network of communications that covers the whole globe, even if does penetrate every corner of it. \u201d\n6The diffusion of Western law with early \nmodern colonization not only \ufb01ts the concept of globalization well, but also \ncan in fact be taken as one of its primary examples. The concept of Western \nlaw still requires some discussion. What later became Western law \u2013 a term \nthat Harold Berman made universally known \u2013 was the same as European law or\nius commune , the learned law consisting of Roman and canon law at \nt h eb e g i n n i n go ft h ee a r l ym o d e r np e r i o d .E u r o p e a nl a w ,b yt h et i m et h e  \noverseas conquests began, was already falling into regional subcategories \nbecause of the contact that ius commune made with particular local laws.7\nThe idea of Castilian regents was to incorporate the desired Roman legal texts into written statutes (most notably the\nSiete Partidas of Alfonso X the \nWise) and prevent the use of Roman law otherwise. How successful this was \nis disputed.8In any case, the derecho com\u00fan of Castile was clearly one of the \n6Twining (2000) 4. Twining\u2019s concept of globalization is, however, not historically very \nsensitive. Duncan Kennedy has, by contrast, approached the subject of globalization \nhistorically by distinguishing three periods of globalization in the West: the period of \nclassical legal thought (ca. 1850\u20131914), the period of socially oriented legal thought \n(1900\u20131968), and the most recent period of \u201cpolicy analysis, neoformalism, and adjudica-tion\u201d (1945\u2013). See K ennedy (2006).\n7 Many legal historians, most recently Patrick Glenn, in fact deny the existence of one\nius \ncommune , claiming that the Latin-based ius commune consisting of mainly Roman law \nnever existed, but that it always appeared as regional variants only \u2013 gemeines Recht and \nDerecho com\u00fan , for instance. See G lenn (2005) 42\u201343. Other skeptical views against the \nexistence of a truly uni \ufb01edius commune have been o ffered by O sler (1997); H alp\u00e9rin\n(2000) 724; and H eirbaut (2003) 304\u2013305. These views are very di fferent from the tradi-\ntional ones represented by Francesco Calasso, Helmut Coing and most recently Manlio \nBellomo. As a Nordic legal historian, the author of the present article cannot help but \nagree with the critical voices. However, the localized variants of ius commune had much to \ndo with each other. The overarching learned la w was practically the same everywhere, but \nsince the local laws were di fferent (written or not), the overall combination of the two (or \nmore) layers of law turned out di fferently.\n8 Again, opinions diverge as to whether the Siete Partidas amounted to a \u201cSpanish common \nlaw, \u201d or whether the law book of Alfonso X was the highest layer of ius proprium ,a b o v e  \nwhich the pan-European ius commune still existed. See B arrientos Grand \u00f3n(2000) 203; \nPetit (1982); J acobson (2002).\n100 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kiEuropean variants of ius commune , sharing the essential features of both civil \nand procedural law with other variants of the European ius commune .T h i s  \nSpanish variant of European law served as the basis and bridge for what \ncame to constitute the law for Spanish America from 1492 onwards.\nWe still have one more terminological hurdle to cross, the term \u201cSpanish \ncolonial law. \u201d Derecho indiano is the term most frequently used in Spanish to \ndenote the legal system in force in the Spanish colonies during the early \nmodern period. Like all geographical ways of limiting law, which is essen-\ntially a shi fting phenomenon, so derecho indiano is also not a natural entity, \nbut was created at a particular time and place. In this case, the term was put \ninto historiographical use in the early twentieth century as part of the His-panist ideology of that period.\n9Like all geographical de \ufb01nitions of law, \nderecho indiano is helpful in distinguishing and pointing out a particular \narea of study from other such areas. However, by highlighting its particu-larity,\nderecho indiano also tends to conceal connections that the law in \nSpanish America had with Spanish and other European law. In this way, it does not diff er from \u201cEuropean\u201d or \u201cNordic\u201d law. Like any national legal \nhistory, the research tradition of\nderecho indiano has tended to highlight its \nparticularity instead of denoting its similarities (or di fferences) with other \ncolonial systems or European law. In other words, comparative studies on Spanish colonial law have been completely lacking until recent years.\n10This \nis particularly strange considering that general historians have been engaged \nin comparative \u201cAtlantic studies\u201d since the 1970s.11The lack of comparative \nstudies tends to create an illusion of uniqueness of national (or quasi-nation-\nal, such as derecho indiano ) legal systems. Comparative studies tend to dimin-\ni s hs u c hi l l u s i o n s .\nThis article challenges the uniqueness of Spanish colonial law in two \nrespects. First, I wish to claim that Spanish colonial law was just one variant of European and Spanish law. Second, Spanish colonial law was only one version of colonial legal orders. Therefore, it can and should be approached \n9S e e P ihlajam\u00e4ki (2010).\n10 In this respect, Spanish colonial law is not di fferent from the mainstream legal history on \nany of the discipline\u2019s sub \ufb01elds. R oss\u2019s article (2008a) is a notable exception, and I have \nmyself authored a few articles in which derecho indiano is compared to European law from \nvarious aspects. See P ihlajam\u00e4ki (1997); P ihlajam\u00e4ki (2002) and P ihlajam\u00e4ki (2004).\n11 See D avies (1973); E lliott (1970); and D aunton /Halperin (1999).\nThe Westernization of Police Regulation 101in the global context of the expansion of European law to other continents. \nThis does not mean that derecho indiano should not be used as an object of \nstudy \u2013 this article is doing just that, of course. Instead, scholars should be aware of the position of Spanish colonial law within a global context. It is necessary to understand that the concept of\nderecho indiano is essentially \nmodern, created by legal historians trained in the period of national positive law. In this respect, it is no diff erent from concepts like European, Nordic, or \nFar Eastern law. To portray Spanish colonial law as a separate or quasi-sep-arate system of law would not have occurred to early modern Castilian or \ncriollo legal professionals operating under the auspices of the Castilian \nCrown. I will now turn to the modern de \ufb01nitions of Spanish colonial law.\nIII. What was Spanish colonial law?\nThe Spanish Crown was quick to organize the administration of its overseas territories in America. Formally speaking, the Indies were incorporated into the Castilian Crown, although the Castilian kings were also the kings of \nAragon. Because the American territories were incorporated as a conquered \nterritory, it was up to the Castilian Crown to organize their administration without the institutional barriers that limited the authoritarian exercise of kingship in Castile. For instance, no\nCortes , or representative assembly, was \never introduced on the American side of the Atlantic.12\nThe legal order that regulated life in the colonies was basically Castilian \nlaw. This was based on the Siete Partidas , a thirteenth century compilation \nheavily in \ufb02uenced by Roman and canon law later supplemented by royal \nregulation and court practice. The legal scholarship on ius commune inevi-\ntably in \ufb02uenced Castilian law as well.Vigorous development by way of royal \nregulation was precisely what the early modern monarchs engaged in to gain increasing control of their lands. This royal legislation was police regulation.\nAccording to a formal de \ufb01nition, Spanish colonial law was a \u201ccompound \nof legal rules applicable in the Indies, that is, in the American, Asian and \nOceanic territories dominated by Spain. \u201d Spanish colonial law can therefore \nbe divided into a. norms speci \ufb01cally created for the Indies (\nderecho indiano \n12 E lliott (2007) 120\u2013122. Elliott observes, however, that the institutional barriers limiting \nthe royal authority had not become as important during the Middle Ages in Castile as \nthey had in Aragon.\n102 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kipropiamente tal o municipal ); b. Castilian law ( derecho castellano ), which was \nused if \u201cproper derecho indiano \u201d did contain the normative solution needed; \nand c. Indian law ( derecho ind\u00edgena ) ,o rt h el a wo ft h ea b o r i g i n a l s .13In \naddition to secular norms, we can also speak of the canon law of the Spanish \ncolonies ( derecho indiano canonico )a st h ec a n o nl a wi nf o r c ei nS p a n i s h  \nAmerica.14These de \ufb01nitions reveal that \u201cproper\u201d Spanish colonial law stood \nin relation to Castilian law, used as a subsidiary body of law whenever \nderecho indiano c o u l dn o tp r o v i d ea na n s w e r .T h es a m ea p p l i e st ot h ec a n o n  \nlaw of Spanish America and canon law in general.\nWhen did derecho indiano propiamente tal ,S p a n i s hc o l o n i a ll a wi nt h e  \nnarrow sense of the term, not provide an swers for legal problems? And when \nit did, what was Spanish colonial law \u201cproperly speaking\u201d? Technical de \ufb01-\nnitions do not take a stand on what kinds of rules \u201cSpanish colonial law properly speaking\u201d consisted of. In principle, it could contain all kinds of rules, especially if customary law is taken into consideration, but in practice it did not. If we want to set Spanish colonial law into a comparative context, we cannot avoid looking beyond technical de \ufb01nitions and attempting to \nunderstand the norms the Castilian regents thought appropriate to bestow on their possessions on other continents.\n15\nSome modern authors have given material descriptions of Spanish colo-\nnial law. Ricardo Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa, one of the grand old men of the \ufb01eld \nde\ufb01nes derecho indiano as \u201ca system of law, doctrines, and customs, created or \naccepted by the Castilian kings, in order to organize the spiritual or secular government of the Hispanic New World, regulate the condition of its inhab-\nitants, direct navigation and commerce, and, above all, ensure the incorpo-ration of the Indians into the Catholic faith. \u201d\n16Anyone acquainting them-\nselves with the literature on Spanish colonial law cannot help noticing the heavy accent on these and other issues, and the lack of literature on others. Collections of papers issued regularly as a result of the conferences organized by the Institute of the History of Spanish Colonial Law (\nInstituto de Historia \n13 \u201c[E]l conjunto de reglas jur\u00eddicas aplicables en Indias, o sea, los territorios de Am \u00e9rica, \nAsia y Ocean\u00eda dominados por Espa\u00f1a. \u201d D ougnac Rodr\u00edguez (1994) 11.\n14 See D uve(2008).\n15 This is not to exclude local norm-giving, which occurred in all parts of Spanish America \nand at various levels of its administration.\n16 Z orraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa22 (1994) 407.\nThe Westernization of Police Regulation 103del Derecho Indiano ) are a good way of obtaining an overview of what india-\nnistas have produced \u2013 and what they have not been so interested in.17\nThe Conference papers show a heavy emphasis on questions such as \nconstitutional and administrative law, ecclesiastical law, mining law and \nwater law. Much has also been written on the administrative institutions (such as\ncabildos and audiencias ) and institutions of feudal law (such as \nencomienda ). Considerably less has been written on the private law, criminal \nlaw, and procedural Law of the Indies. The scholarship on the history of private law in the Indies has tended to stress Spanish colonial law as part of the European\nius commune . Much the same can be said about the literature \non criminal and procedural law.18\nThe reason for the scarcity of scholarship in some \ufb01elds and the concen-\ntration of scholarship in others is obvious: derecho indiano \u201cproperly speak-\ning\u201d was mostly the regulation of \ufb01elds that needed special treatment in the \nIndies. Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa\u2019s de \ufb01nition of derecho indiano above hints at this \ntrend, which I have treated in more detail elsewhere; namely, that much of\nderecho indiano propiamente dicho i si nf a c tf u n c t i o n a l l yt h es a m et y p eo f  \nlegislation which has been called \u201cpolice law\u201d ( Polizeirecht ) or laws pertain-\ning to \u201cgood government\u201d ( buen gobierno ) in recent international legal his-\ntoriography. Police law in the early modern sense of the word refers to the legislative activity of an early modern state, which organizes its administra-tion with statutes, decrees, ordinances, and other pieces of legislation.\nThe ideology legitimating this o ften massive amount of legislation pour-\ning from the chanceries of early modern kingdoms, towns, and other legis-lating entities was that of good government,\nStaatsr\u00e4son orraison d\u2019\u00c9tat . \nA r e a sa sd i fferent as religion, security and public order, agriculture, industry \nand commerce, tra ffic, construction, culture and sciences, as well as the \ncontrol of the poor and the marginalized, needed detailed legislation.19In \nthese various ways, early modern police ordinances attempted to create and maintain public order, discipline and stability, but at the same time promote \n17 The Conferences have been organized at intervals of 2\u20134 years since 1966 in either His-\npanic America or peninsular Spain.\n18 See, for instance, the conference proceedings mentioned above, note 10 (P ihlajam\u00e4ki ).\n19 In recent decades, the literature on police has grown immensely, and no comprehensive \nlist is worth attempting here. See, for instance, S tolleis (1993), H \u00e4rter /Stolleis (1996) \nand the subsequent parts of the series.\n104 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kithe well-being of society.20Church ordinances in the reformed parts of \nEurope came very close to police ordinances. In some parts of Europe, such \nas Sweden, separate church police regulations ( kyrkopoliti ) were issued, but \nnot church ordinances.21\nThe emergence of police regulation is thus closely linked to the rise of the \nmodern state and modern absolutism. Spain was no exception to this general \nEuropean tendency. Johannes-Michael Scholz has noted that the Spanish \nlegislator\u2019s interest in police matters grew considerably between the Nueva \nRecopilaci\u00f3n of 1640 and the Nov\u00edsima Recopilaci\u00f3n of 1805.22Police law was \nthe most modern regulatory tool that the early modern prince aiming at \nabsolute power had at his disposal, although one has to bear in mind that the effectiveness of police regulation o ften leftmuch to be desired. Although \npolice law was a tool of the monarch, its legitimating ideology also imposed limits on the use of police, because the regulations could only be used to further the common good, the\nbonum commune .\nFrom the very beginning of the conquest, the Spanish Crown issued a \nlarge number of statutes to regulate life in the Indies. The jurist Antonio \nLe\u00f3n Pinelo is said to have extracted the thousands of royal c\u00e9dulas that made \nup the Recopilaci\u00f3n de las leyes de Indias , a compilation of statutes printed in \n1680 but already \ufb01nished in 1635, from approximately 400,000 laws.23The \nlaws tended to govern every detail of routine administration and were o ften \nextremely casuistic, as police regulation tended to be. Clarence Haring men-tions, as examples of the areas governed,\u201cthe \ufb01xing of prices, the ferry charge \non the river at Santo Domingo, the right to own \ufb01shing boats, permission to \nimport from Spain cattle and foodstu ffs necessary for the subsistence of the \nnew overseas communities, the right to engage in local trade with nearby settlements, or to build vessels for such a trade; the exact manner in which a \ntown must be laid out, the width of the streets and their direction in relation to the sun, the size and subdivision of the city blocks, the location of the church and the town hall. \u201d\n24Religious matters could with good reason be \n20 H \u00e4rter (1993) 62\u201363.\n21 On the di fferent concepts of police in relation to ecclesiastical administration, especially \nin Germany, see S tolleis (1992) 250.\n22 See S cholz (1996) 230\u2013231.\n23 H aring (1947) 113. Haring says that the \ufb01nalRecopilaci\u00f3n contains 6400 c\u00e9dulas ,w h e r e a s  \nmore recent scholarship mentions the \ufb01gure 7308; see D ougnac (1994) 11.\n24 H aring (1947) 120\u2013121.\nThe Westernization of Police Regulation 105added to the list, making it look like a rather typical catalog of police \nregulation in any region of the early modern Western world.\nThe amount of legislation was indeed such that it soon started to call for \nsome sort of general presentation. Both compilations and literature started to appear to meet this need. Of the scholars in the \ufb01eld, the most famous was \nJuan Sol \u00f3rzano Pereira, who was a judge of the\nAudiencia of Lima. The \nleading derecho indiano author of the colonial period, Sol \u00f3rzano\u2019s major \nwork, Pol\u00edtica Indiana (1648), deals with \u201cthe law and the government par-\nticular to the Indies\u201d ( Derecho y Gobierno particular de las Indias ).25\nThe work is divided into six \u201cbooks, \u201d which deal with the discovery of \nAmerica (I), the social position of the aborigines (book II), the creoles as landowners (book III), ecclesiastical government (book IV), as well as \nadministrative (book V) and economic organization (book VI) of the Indies. \nThe general plan of the book reveals that Sol \u00f3rzano\u2019s\npol\u00edtica was essentially \nsimilar to European police regulations. In the second book, chapters I\u2013XXIV are about the \u201cpersonal services\u201d of the Indians, such as the construction of buildings (II. VIII.1.\u201314.), agriculture (II.IX.1.\u201340.), the postal service (II: \nXIV .1.\u201332.), mining (II.XV .1.\u201356.), as well as tributes (II.XIX.1.\u201356.) and \ntithes (II.XXIII.1.\u201343.). These are all areas of regulation central to the Euro-pean\nius politiae .\nBecause we are dealing with a partic ular kind of police regulation, Sol \u00f3-\nrzano Pereira\u2019s magnum opus , however, is almost completely devoid of major \nareas of law such as private, criminal, and procedural law. The law in these areas by and large followed Castilian law, which, in turn, was just one version of the European\nius commune .\nThe huge amount of the laws was also compiled, \ufb01rst as private initiatives, \nthen as more o fficial ones as well. The cedulario (register of royal laws and \ndecrees) of Vasco de Puga, judge of the New Mexico audiencia ,w a sp r i n t e da s  \nearly as the 1560s. The registers proved helpful in compiling the work, and later compilers also used them as material. Antonio Le \u00f3nP i n e l o ,a sm e n -\ntioned above, bore the main burden of compiling the major general collec-\ntion of laws of the laws of the Indies. The work took place under the super-\nvision of \ufb01rst Rodrigo de Aguiar y Acu\u00f1a and then Juan Sol \u00f3rzano Pereira. \n25 S ol\u00f3rzano y Pereyra (1648) I.I.1, 22. The work \ufb01rst appeared in Latin as De indianum \niurein 1629.\n106 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kiOnce completed, copies of the compilation were sent to viceroys, audiencias , \ncabildos , and other major \ufb01gures of the Spanish colonial administration.26\nThe Recopilaci\u00f3n is divided into nine books, which include \u2013 roughly \nspeaking \u2013 ecclesiastical government (I), matters concerning the Council \nof the Indies and audiencias (II), political and military administration, vice-\nroys, and captains-general (III), the legal foundation of colonization (IV), \nprovincial government (V), Indians (VI), criminal law (VII), the royal ex-\nchequer (VIII), and commerce and navigation (IX).27The titles of the books \nare quite telling of the contents of the compilation and thus of Spanish \ncolonial law itself, since the material included in Pinelo\u2019s compilation con-centrates heavily on the administration of various kinds and commerce.\nBook VII, the provisions of which share elements of penal law, is by far \nthe shortest and far from intended as a comprehensive criminal code. Its eight headings include regulations on judges (1), games and players (2), marriage problems resulting from husbands being away from their wives in America (3), vagabonds and gypsies (4), the black people and those of mixed race (5), prisons (6), prison inspections (7), and crimes and punish-\nments (8). Most of the titles thus again deal with matters of typical police \nregulation. Criminal law as such is not the point here, not even in heading 8 on crimes and punishment, the 29 laws of which are really a haphazard collection of regulations concerning matters of particular concern for the Crown in the colonies. For instance, law 11 of heading 8 requires that those \nsentenced to the gallie should be sent to Cartagena or Tierra \ufb01rme to serve \ntheir sentences. According to law 15, the judges ought not to moderate the \nlegal punishment \u2013 which was probably also customary in America as else-where in the Western world. Furthermore, law 17 established that judges \nshould refrain from accepting settlements except in \u201cvery special cases, at the \nrequest and wish of the parties, and if the case was such that it [did] not require satisfaction to the public cause. \u201d\nThe examples are numerous, but I think the point is clear: Book VII is no \npenal code in the sense of\nConstitutio Criminalis Carolina (1532) or Ordon-\nnance de Villers-Cotter\u00eats (1539), but rather a collection of rules not capable of \nfunctioning without the general background of Spanish penal and proce-\n26 H aring (1947) 113.\n27 The Recopilaci\u00f3n is now conveniently available on the Internet, http://www.congreso.\ngob.pe/ntley/LeyIndiaP .htm.\nThe Westernization of Police Regulation 107d u r a ll a w .T h i si se v e nm o r eo b v i o u si fw et h i n ka b o u tp r i v a t el a w ,o nw h i c h  \ntheRecopilaci\u00f3n is practically silent.\nI will take one more example of the Spanish colonial legislation from a \nparticular part of the Spanish colonies, for which the catalogues of statutes have recently been published, R\u00edo de la Plata (1534\u20131717), Charcas (1563\u20131717), and Tucum\u00e1n and Paraguay (1573\u20131716). The great majority of the statutes catalogued in these registries can, hardly surprisingly considering \nwhat has been said above, be classi \ufb01ed as police law. Some of the statutes \ndeal with administration, religion and the protection of aborigines. A vast \nmajority, however, has to do with the economy and the military.\n28Again, \ncriminal, procedural, and private law remain only sporadically regulated.\nThe precise character of police regulation as \u201claw\u201d is not clear either. \nPolice regulations were, for instance, le ftout of the Swedish Law of the \nRealm of 1734, a compilation of laws otherwise thought perfect and un-changeable. The natural law ideology underlying the compilations designed as eternal in fact demanded the exclusion of police regulations because of their mutable character.\nWas\nderecho indiano really considered law, in the natural law understand-\ning of the word? At least the name of the original Latin version of Pol\u00edtica \nIndiana ,De indianum iure , suggests as much, although the title of the Span-\nish translation seems to convey that we are moving in the borderlands of law and more practical regulation. Another essential and speci\ufb01cc h a r a c t e r i s t i co f  \nSpanish colonial law o ften mentioned in the literature is its changing char-\nacter. The law adapts to circumstances, which change, according to Tau \nAnzo\u00e1tegui, \u201cquicker than \u2026 is experienced in other, more consolidated societies. \u201d\n29In his Casuismo y sistema (1992), Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui shows how \nthe notion of the mutability of the Indian world became common currency at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and remained so all through the Spanish conquest.\n30Gaspar de Villarroel, one of the leading American legal \nscholars of the seventeenth century wrote that \u201cit is impossible that in this new world the government were \ufb01rm and stable, and that the laws were \n28 See Libros registros-cedularios del R\u00edo de la Plata I\u2013III (1534\u20131717) (1984\u20131991); Libros regis-\ntros-cedularios de Charcas (1563\u20131717) (1992\u20131994); Libros registros-cedularios del Tucum\u00e1n y \nParaguay (1573\u20131716) (2000); and P ihlajam\u00e4ki (2002).\n29 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992) 108.\n30 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992) 108\u2013114.\n108 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kilasting: because there is such a large number of particularities, in the cure of \nwhich the laws assist, the human animal varies so much that today he is \ndisturbed by the same medicine that healed him yesterday. \u201d31\nThe changing nature of Spanish colonial law also goes hand in hand with \nt h ec h a n g i n gn a t u r eo fp o l i c el a wi ng e n e r a l .T h en e e df o rc o n s t a n ta n d  \nrapid change was even greater in the distant American lands, which were not only remote but also internally disparate. The modern legislative technique \nof\nius politiae was extremely suitable for such circumstances. The institution \nof \u201cobedience without compliance, \u201d the inheritance of medieval Castilian \nlaw, came to serve much the same goal of constantly accommodating legis-lation to local needs.\n32\nThe whole legislative ideology changed in the modern era. In the middle \nages, legislation, at least in theory, had not created new law but only fol-lowed tradition. In the absolutist state, all this necessarily ended: from now on, the sovereign\u2019s command was law. Law could be changed anytime and basically in any way the sovereign wished, as long as he respected the limits of natural law and the law of God, and as long as his commands worked in \nfavor of the common good. This type of legislation, as Stolleis has remarked, \ncould easily react to the changing circumstances but was lacking \u201dscienti \ufb01c \ncoherence. \u201d In this sense, a police statute was in fact closer to the individual command of the sovereign than to a law intended to last. Because of this \u201clack of jurisprudential character\u201d (\nMarginalit\u00e4ten des juristischen Elementes ) \nin Germany (and elsewhere), police statutes were not taught in law faculties o ft h eu n i v e r s i t i e su n t i lt h en i n e t e e n t hc e n t u r y ,b u tr a t h e rs h o v e do v e rt o  philosophical faculties.\n33\nIn short, corresponding to the latest trend in European statutory law, \nSpanish colonial law was police regulation. This can be said, I think, at least \n31 \u201cEs imposible que en este nuevo mundo sea \ufb01rme y \ufb01jo el gobierno, y que las leyes \nhumanas sean duraderas: porque sobre ser tan sin n\u00famero los casos particulares, a cuyo \nremedio asisten las leyes, es el hombre animal tan vario, que hoy le turba la salud \nla medicina que le sanaba ayer. \u201d Villarroel, Gobierno, II, XVII, IV , 14. Cited at T au \nAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992) 111.\n32 The principle of \u201cobs \u00e9rvase pero no cumpla\u201d allowed the authorities of the Spanish colo-\nnies, as an individual statute did not seem suitable for the local circumstances, to leave the \nstatute unapplied while at the same time not formally violating it. E lliott (1970) \n131\u2013132.\n33 S tolleis (1992) 244.\nThe Westernization of Police Regulation 109as long as we do not stick to a formalistic de \ufb01nition of Spanish colonial law, \nwhich de \ufb01n e si ta se v e r y t h i n ga p p l i e di nt h eS p a n i s hl a w . Derecho indiano\nwas police law if we concentrate our observations on what was typical of \nderecho indiano propiamente dicho ; in other words, the parts of Spanish col-\nonial law which di ffered most from the compound of the laws of peninsular \nSpain and which were most typical of the Indies \u2013 typical in the sense that \nthe police regulations formed the kernel of Spanish colonial law. In this \nrespect, derecho indiano was no di ffe r e n tf r o mt h el a wi nm o s tr e g i o n so f  \nEurope.\nThe comparative research question that now almost automatically arises is \nwhether the same can be said of the other colonial legal orders of the early \nmodern period. Alternatively, are we allowed to continue to speak of derecho \nindiano in terms of exceptionalism that until now has dominated the dis-\ncussions, if not expressly then at least as a tacit presumption? I shall now move on to these problems.\nIV . Comparative Aspects: British Colonial Law in North America\nI will now brie \ufb02y discuss the case of British colonial law in North America. \nThe precise question is: To what extent did statutory regulation in the British American colonies resemble\nderecho indiano , and in what respect were the \ntwo different from each other?\nThe point that I wish to make in this section is that one of the many \ningredients that English law around 1600 shared with continental law was police regulation, and that this kind of regulation found its way into the British North American colonies as well. In developing police regulation, \nEngland was no di fferent from the German territories, Sweden, or France. In \nall of these polities, legislative powers not only sometimes published codes \nbut also issued great quantities of piecemeal legislation on all walks of life. In German legal language, this kind of legislation came to be conceptualized as \u201cpolice\u201d (\npolicey ); elsewhere, the conceptualization was either lacking, or \nwas ill-de \ufb01ned. The phenomenon, according to present scholarly under-\nstanding, was the same everywhere. A brief look at the colonial legislation quite clearly reveals that the British colonies in North America were no exception. Why should they have been, eager as they were to utilize many other facets of English law as well? I will thus claim that it does not su ffice, as \nfar as colonial legislation is concerned, to pay attention to the colonial codes \n110 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kithat have rightly merited much scholarly attention. It is also worthwhile to \nlook into the abundant colonial police regulation.\nThe emphasis that scholars have recently placed on the complex nature of \nEnglish law at the inception of the colonial period in America is pivotally important. As David Thomas Konig observes, the diversity of North Amer-ican law can hardly be understood without understanding the context of early modern English law. Despite the common law\u2019s position at the courts \nof Westminster, English law was far from uniform. Sir Edward Coke, for \ninstance, enumerated more than 100 courts in the realm, including ecclesi-astical courts, manorial courts, and merchants\u2019 courts on his list. \u201cThe reach of the central common law courts, \u201d according to Konig, was \u201caccording to local forces and practices. \u201d\n34It has been calculated that approximately \ufb01fteen \ndifferent bodies of law governed the life of an average Englishman in 1600: \nno wonder William Blackstone lauded the fact that \u201cthe law hath appointed [such] a prodigious variety of courts in England. \u201d\n35\nEngland\u2019s legal culture thus o ffered huge potential upon which to con-\nstruct the legal orders of the colonies. William O ffutt explains that the far-\nfrom-uniform seventeenth century Engl ish law provided colonial legal liter-\nates ample material, or \u201clegal capital, \u201d on which multiple legal solutions could be dra fted. The legal literates made conscious choices between the \nvarious legal inheritances \u201cto accommodate, prioritize, and integrate\u201d them into a coherent system, O ffutt argues, and ought not to be regarded as \nprimitive versions of metropolitan law.\n36It is crucial to understand that \ncolonial law did not turn out the way it did by force of accident. However, as far as I have been able to determine, none of the contributors to the debate have discussed one important choice that the framers of colonial \nlaw made, which links it not only to English metropolitan law but also to \nSpanish colonial law.\n37This is the nature of North American colonial law as \npolice regulation.\n34 K onig (2008) 151; see also H ulsebosch (2003); O ffutt (2005) 161.\n35 B lackstone (1765\u20131769), 3:24, 30.\n36 O ffutt (2005) 161. O ffutt\u2019s main point is that by the 1680s and 1690s \u201cthe multiple \nsources that had originally nourished colonial legal imaginations were slowly dying out. \u201d \nInstead, \u201cthe common law [\u2026] became virtually the only form of legal capital still \ufb02owing \nacross the Atlantic. \u201d O ffutt (2005) 161\u2013162.\n37 Richard Ross, however, touches upon the subject in his comparative article on the aspect \nof religious discipline, drawing on Massachusetts, Genevan, and Scottish sources. See R oss\n(2008b) 975\u20131002.\nThe Westernization of Police Regulation 111In recent decades, legal historical s cholarship on police regulation has \nspread from Germany to other regions of early modern Europe.38Scholars \nhave con \ufb01rmed that similar regulation existed practically everywhere.39Eng-\nland is no exception, although little research has been done on English \npolice regulation from the comparative point of view. This may be a result of the traditional exceptionalism and isolation of English legal history, although critical research has recently lowered the barrier between common \nlaw and civil law.\n40\nAs far as I know, Robert von Friedeburg\u2019s article on English police reg-\nulation (which he calls Ordnungsgesetzgebung ) is the only study on the sub-\nject. Royal proclamations and parliamentary statutes were, as von Friedeburg \nshows, both instruments of police regulation. In the years 1485\u20131553, at \nleast 437 proclamations were issued. Many of them were, however, intended \nto strengthen the authority of the statutes, and sometimes proclamations only gave further instructions in regard to parliamentary statutes.\n41Statute \nlaw, according to the dominant theory of the sixteenth century, was the leading source of law because it stemmed from Parliament. Under Thomas \nCromwell, a period of statutory reform was instigated, and during Henry \nVIII\u2019s reign alone, 677 statutes were issued.\n42Both the proclamations and \nthe statutes of the late \ufb01fteenth to early seventeenth centuries covered very \nmuch the same matters as police regulation everywhere else in Europe: commerce, luxury, clothing, poor relief, vagabondage, health care, and reli-\ngion, to mention but some of the most typical.\n43Royal proclamations, \naccording to the prevailing scholarly understanding, probably had little \n38 One notable exception is R aeff (1983), in which the author compares German and Rus-\nsian police regulations in the early modern period. In the history of police regulation, \nRaeff was also an early starter and could therefore not take into consideration all the \nresearch in the \ufb01eld that has actually emerged only since the 1990s.\n39 See the articles in Stolleis /H\u00e4rter /Schilling (1996).\n40 See, for instance, Zimmermann, who has on many occasions emphasized the similarities \nof legal institutions on both sides of the English Channel; see, e. g., Z immermann (1993); \nand Freda, who has stressed the fact that not only common law but also early modern \ncontinental legal orders were very much driven by court precedents; see F reda (2009) \n263\u2013278.\n41 F riedeburg (1996) 583\u2013584.\n42 F riedeburg (1996) 586.\n43 See H ughes /Larkin (1964), (1969a) and (1969b).\n112 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kipractical e ffect, or at least we know little of their e ffects.44This, again, \ufb01ts the \ngeneral European pattern. The fact that the English police regulation can be \nobserved from the point of view of domestic power politics of the estates and \nthe Crown, does not, however, prevent one from seeing the English royal proclamations and parliamentary statutes as essentially part of the same wave of police regulation that was taking over most of Europe in the early modern period. There was, no doubt, English\npolicey .45\nWritten law, the actual \u201ccodes\u201d included, was even more important for \nthe colonies than for England. The colonists could not wait for the inherited common law doctrines to develop so as to meet the speci \ufb01c needs of the \nAmericans. As a text-book of American legal history says, \u201cEngland [\u2026] had no need to consider, in its law, the problem of hostile native tribes [\u2026] Some \nvariations were natural \u2013 they stemmed from climate or the lay of the land; \nothers were structural, depending upon whether the colony was a Crown colony, a chartered colony, or a proprietorship [\u2026] Initial di fferences in land \nor structure led to still further di fferentiation. \u201d\n46William Nelson has \nobserved that in Virginia, the \u201crulers sought to accomplish their main chore, \nwhich was to coerce labor out of the local inhabitants, through intimidation \nand brutality, while New England\u2019s leaders strove to create a religious utopia by recourse to the law of God, not the law of England. \u201d These norms took the form of statutory law, such as Dale\u2019s Code of Virginia (1611), in addition to which English customary law was also used. In the initial period of the \ncolonization, however, English common law was not on the agenda.\n47Com-\nmon law with all its intricacies was simply too sophisticated a tool for \ndirecting the new colonies e ffectively and, what is more, it could not func-\ntion without lawyers. Common law might have been, as Lawrence Friedman \nputs it, \u201csomehow the norm; colonial diff erences, then, were examples of \nsome sort of rude primitivity. \u201d48\n44 E liot (1965); F riedeburg (1996) 583.\n45 Von Friedeburg remarks that the English language did not follow the continental termi-\nnology in transforming the Aristotelian \u201cpolity\u201d to \u201cpolicey\u201d during the seventeenth cen-\ntury (F riedeburg (1996) 579). This does not, of course, mean that the English were not \naware of the continental development or that the English \u201cpolice\u201d were completely di ffer-\nent from its continental counterpart.\n46 F riedman (1985) 37.\n47 N elson (2008) 16.\n48 F riedman (1985) 34.\nThe Westernization of Police Regulation 113The common law gained importance over time as soon as lawyers started \narriving. These \u201clegal literates\u201d o ften had legal education and continued \nenhancing their need of legal information by reading English treatises.49\nThe legal orders of the colonies were also controlled by the Privy Council \nin London, although, as Richard Ross has observed, the Council\u2019s decisions were too few to control legal life in the colonies e ffectively. The Privy Coun-\ncil only took relatively few cases from the colonies under consideration. In \nthis respect, the di fference from Spanish America is clear: it was much easier \nfor private individuals and authorities to have their cases heard in the Coun-\ncil of the Indies than it was for the British colonists to reach the Privy Council.\n50\nEven the common law turned out di fferently in America. In many cases, \nEnglish legal doctrines needed to be simpli \ufb01ed to suit the needs of the \ncolonies. For instance, the writ system was not adopted as such.

At least around 1700, \ncolonial legal culture was underdeveloped, as seen through the eyes of an English observer. The lawyers had received little or no training at an educa-\ntional institution such as the Inns of Court, had not been formally admitted to a professional organization, and lacked the social status of their English counterparts.\n53\nAlthough the colonists thus adopted the basic blueprint of English law, \nthey did so only with many deviations from the original model. The devia-tions were typically simpli \ufb01cations, necessary because of the initial lack of \nlawyers and their later scarcity. The functioning of the English common law would have been unthinkable in its original form in the absence of lawyers \nable to master its technicalities.\n49 See B ilder (1999) 83\u2013102.\n50 R oss(2008a) 118\u2013121.\n51 N elson (2008) 37.\n52 N elson (1975) x.\n53 See K onig (2008) 157.\n114 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kiNot all changes were due to the lack of lawyers, however. Some resulted \nfrom the fact that the circumstances in America were radically di fferent from \nthose in England, where the common law doctrines had emerged. England\u2019s \nsixteenth century experience of extending its justice system into the Welsh and Northern marchlands, Ireland served as a background for events in Virginia and, despite di ffering circumstances between North America and \nVirginia, there were also many similarities leading to similar outcomes.\n54\nIn Wales and the North, instead of a fully developed common law system, \njudicial power was entrusted to the local lords and their conciliar courts with a simple royal commission, which granted barons broad discretion in shap-ing justice. Hardly surprisingly, it came to look quite di fferent from the \ncommon law. The conciliar justice involved no juries. Legal proceedings \nwere speedy, as no common law protection shielded the accused in criminal \ncases and because the complicated forms of the civil procedure were not followed. As David Thomas Konig observes, the Crown was forced to toler-ate these deviances from the common law as the price for maintaining at least minimal control over these areas. Later on, the same pattern emerged \nin Ireland, as the Tudors extended conciliar justice there, leaving the central \ncourts at Westminster with little in \ufb02uence on the island. In Ireland, just as \npreviously in Wales and the North, the interests of a centrally led but com-plicated common law needed to yield to a more straightforward and discre-tionary judicial power. Little externa l constraint or accountability was \nimposed upon any of these courts.\n55\nHowever, unlike Wales and the northern marshlands, conciliar justice \nfailed in Ireland, largely because of the weaker status of the local magnates. Conciliar justice ultimately made way for the common law, which, better \nequipped as it was to secure land tenures, served the interests of English \ncolonizers and land owners more e ffectively.\n56\nThe \ufb01rst phase of colonization in North America followed similar pat-\nterns. The leaders assumed and were granted wide powers in organizing legal administration, and they largely ignored and bypassed English common law \ndevelopments. By the 1630s, however, the initial phase of \u201cmarshland jus-\ntice\u201d was over. Eight common law courts replaced the monthly courts that \n54 K onig (1991).\n55 K onig (1991) 72.\n56 K onig (1991) 78.\nThe Westernization of Police Regulation 115had delivered justice hitherto, and sheri ffst o o kt h ep l a c eo fp r o v o s t s - m a r -\nshals. In 1632, the General Assembly ordered that justice be administered \u201cas \nneere as may be, accordinge to the lawes of England. \u201d57\nAt the beginning of colonization, since it was o ften unclear which law \nshould be applied, so-called introduct ion statutes were issued in some colo-\nnies.58A principle developed over the years, according to which the laws of \nthe colonies should not be repugnant to the English laws although di ffer-\nences arising from the needs of the place and the people could arise. Mary \nSarah Bilder calls this the \u201ctransatlantic constitution, \u201d According to Bilder, the \u201cconstitution\u201d was unwritten, although it sometimes found its way into legal documents. The Rhode Island Charter of 1663 expresses these princi-ples of repugnancy and divergence as follows:\n59\n[T]he laws, ordinances, and constitutions [of Rhode Island], so made, be not con-\ntrary and repugnant onto, but as near as may be, agreeable to the laws of this our \nrealm of England, considering the nature and the constitution of the place and \npeople there.60\nUntil the eighteenth century, it remained unclear whether and to what \nextent the laws of England, the common law statutes, would apply in the \ncolonies. The so-called introduction statutes solved the problem by deter-mining the circumstances in which the English law would apply. Rhode Island\u2019s introduction statute of 1700 declared that English law would be \nexecuted if the colony\u2019s own laws would not cover the case.\n61English law \nwas, in other words, given subsidiary status in a true ius commune sense of the \nterm.\nBoth the discretion le ftto the local magnates in charge of shaping con-\nciliar justice in Wales, Northern England, and Ireland and the failure of conciliar justice in Ireland and North A merica reveal important things about \nhow laws were transferred to colonies in the early modern period. The initial \nphase of legal development in the North American followed much the same pattern of simpli \ufb01ed justice. The way legal orders took shape was not merely \nin\ufb02uenced by political realities, the practical need to allow concessions to \nthose actually in charge of representing the political power of the Crown. \n57 K onig (1991) 92.\n58 B ilder (2008) 99.\n59 B ilder (2004) 1.\n60 B ilder (2004) 2.\n61 B ilder (2008) 98\u201399.\n116 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kiThe local holders of judicial power also had to gain legitimacy among the \npopulace. In other words, political alliances decisively determined how jus-\ntice would and could be shaped.\nThe political power alignment was nevertheless only one determinant. \nAnother was geography. Time and space both created challenges from the \npoint of view of maintaining a genuinely English system of common law, even after the common law courts had been established in the 1630s. The \ngeographical di fferences\nper se sometimes called for di fferent legal arrange-\nm e n t s .T h et i m ef a c t o ra l s op l a y e dar o l es i n c ec r o s s i n gt h eo c e a nt o o kt i m e ,  as such the colonists were not always aware of the latest legal developments in England, at least not right away.\n62In this respect, British North America \nwas similar to Spain\u2019s South America. Another similarity was that the local \ncircumstances, in both parts of America, soon came to be controlled by a \nsimilar legislative technique, police regulation.\nIf English police regulation has attracted little attention, the American \nequivalent has produced even less scholarship; in fact none. The English Crown produced relatively little special legislation for the American colo-\nnies, which is a major divergence from Spain\u2019s relations with its overseas \ncolonies from a comparative point of view.Taking into consideration the fact that police regulation was far from unknown in England, the scarcity of British legislation in America cannot be explained by the existence of a common law tradition. The lack of royal laws can be understood much \nbetter when observed against the context of the relative laxness of colonial \npractices on the British side of the Atlantic.\nIn Spanish America, various authorities were constantly reporting on \neach other to the Crown. The activities of Spanish o fficials could be checked \nin various ways. The\nvisita or visitation, an institution developed in medieval \ncanon law and known in many parts of Europe, could be imposed upon an official as a result of an individual complaint to\nConsejo de Indias or \nif suspicions had otherwise arisen. At the end of his term of o ffice, every \nofficial\u2019s activities were checked as a matter of course in the residencia\n62 But, as Ross remarks, \u201cthe great distances that the Atlantic Ocean created between colo-\nnies and metropoles provides (by itself) a weak explanation of the forms of imperial \ngovernance in the Americas. The English and Spanish empires, which both spanned the \nAtlantic, established di fferent systems of legal communication that grew out of the dis-\nsimilar political and social contexts. \u201d R oss(2008a) 118.\nThe Westernization of Police Regulation 117procedures.63The English Crown imposed no such routine scrutiny on the \nAmerican authorities.64\nThe British issued important legislation regarding the whole Empire, \nespecially on commerce, such as the important navigation acts, laying the \nbasis for British mercantilism.65Although the English otherwise allowed the \nlocal authorities much more freedom in deciding how to run the colonies, some royal proclamations dealing speci \ufb01cally with colonial issues were \nnevertheless issued. Examples inclu de the proclamation on forbidding a \nlottery in Virginia and the one forbidding the importation of tobacco from elsewhere than Virginia or the Summer Island.\n66Royal proclamations, at \nleast under James I were, however, few. Almost all of them dealt with trans-atlantic questions, typically commerce.\nA more voluminous statutory regulation, intended to regulate the colo-\nnial aff airs\nper se , was worked out on the spot in the colonies themselves. In \nline with the dual authority system of the British colonial world, by the late seventeenth century it had become clear that not only the Crown but also all colonial assemblies were entitled to dra ft, enact, and change their own laws, \nalthough they were then subject to review by the Crown.\n67\nVirginia\u2019s statutes are a good example of the use of statute law in the \nEnglish colonies in North America, beca use Virginia\u2019s legislation was one of \nthose imitated by the other colonies. William Hening collected Virginia\u2019s statutes from 1619 to 1823.\n68This is not the place to thoroughly survey \nHening\u2019s Statutes at large .H e n n i n g \u2019 s Statutes \ufb01ll thirteen volumes, and the \namount of statutory law did not show si gns of diminishing towards the end \nof the colonial period.\nEven a brief look into the index of the Statutes reveals that the Virginian \nstatutes fall squarely into the general pattern of Western early modern police regulation. Early Virginians legislated on bastards (1657), church wardens (1623), drunkenness (1632), fences (1642), hunting (1642), powder (1642), coinage (1645), trespassing animals (1748), weights (1748), and beggars (1755) to mention only a few of the typical areas of statutory law. They do \n63 H aring (1947) 148\u2013157.\n64 E lliott (1970) 126.\n65 See P riest (2008) 406\u2013407.\n66 L arkin /Hughes (1973) 500\u2013502, 627\u2013632.\n67 B ilder (2004) 55.\n68 H ening (1923).\n118 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kinot essentially di ffer from the police regulation in continental Europe: piece-\nmeal legislation disciplining and controlling every aspect of people\u2019s every-\nday lives.\nCustomary law soon started to develop in its own directions in both the \nSpanish and English colonies. Nevertheless, both were also very much gov-\nerned with the help of statutory law. There are, however, two major di ffer-\nences between the ways in which police regulation was employed. The \ufb01rst \nmajor difference is that whereas the vast majority of statutory laws in the \nSpanish colonies originated in Madrid, an overwhelming majority of the statutes in the English North American colonies were produced in the col-onies themselves. Both Spanish and English colonizers took advantage of the most modern legislative technique, the\npolicey . In both cases, some of that \nlegislation was produced on the spot, in the colonies themselves. The second major difference between the Spanish and English colonial legal orders is \nthat that the law in the English North American colonies grew further apart from the laws of the mother country. It seems that this was not so much due to the greater geographical diff erences or other local needs (which exists to a \nsimilar extent in both North and South America) but simply because the Spaniards were able to keep their lawyer-civil servants on a tighter leash better than the English could theirs, as shown by scholars such as J. H. Elliott and Richard Ross.\nAnother factor contributing to greater uniformity of\nderecho indiano as \nagainst North American law was, undoubtedly, the Castilian legislator\u2019s greater propensity towards uni \ufb01cation. Statutes emanating from the\nConsejo \nde Indias were recorded in the cedularios, registries kept by the local author-\nities, which enhanced their usability. The greater centralization of Spanish \nlaw is also re \ufb02ected in the way its laws were codi \ufb01ed. The Recopilaci\u00f3n of \n1680 has no counterpart in North America, although North Americans did \nnot resist the idea of statutory law or codi \ufb01cation as such. The English \ncolonies began to publish authoritative collections of their laws early on, in addition to which private collections also appeared.\n69Although the di ffer-\nences within the vast area of the Spanish Empire were many, the American colonies had been allowed to dri fteven further apart, legally speaking, at an \nearly stage.\n69 As examples can be mentioned For the colony in Virginea Britannia (1612), C otton (1641), \nand The Book of the General Laws and Libertyes (1648) of Massachusetts.\nThe Westernization of Police Regulation 119V . Conclusion: the Westernization of Police Regulation\nin the Early Modern Period\nI have attempted above to demonstrate how the early modern colonialism \ntook advantage of the most modern form of contemporary legal techniques, police regulation, not only in practically all corners of Europe, but also everywhere in the Western world. Although it may seem self-evident and hardly revolutionary to us now, police regulation is, just like any other major legal phenomenon, a historical product developed in time and space. The amount of literature produced on codi \ufb01cation, court decisions, and \u2013 as far \nas Europe is concerned \u2013 police regulation, shows that it is hardly insignif-icant which form law takes.\nThe substance of American police regulation has not been given much \nconsideration in this short piece. Such an undertaking would certainly require more time and space than I presently have at my disposal. Police regulation was a good legal technique to import to the British colonies \nbecause it typically did not require professional lawyers as dra ftsmen or \nusers. The English common law did, the European\nius commune did, and \ncodi\ufb01cations have always required expertise. Police regulation was also quick \nand\ufb02exible \u2013 to what extent it was also e ffective may be questionable.\nJust like the English, so the Spaniards also used the whole array of legal \ntechniques available in peninsular Spain to govern their overseas territories. \nThe traditional areas of civil, criminal, and procedural law could be trans-ported over to the Indies relatively easily with the corps of legal professionals following in the footsteps of the actual\nconquistadores . The traditional legal \ntechniques \u2013 scholarship, court decisions, and codes \u2013 were, however, not \nquick and \ufb02exible enough to master the multitude of new circumstances and \npeoples to which the law needed to react. Instead, the heart of Spanish \ncolonial law, derecho indiano , also came to be based on police regulation, \nof which Spaniards had already gathered plenty of experience on the pen-\ninsula.\nPolice regulation as a legislative technique was a legal transfer, and legal \ntransfers adapt to new social and political circumstances, o ften changing \nwhile they are moved from one place to another. In at least one important \nrespect, police regulation in Spanish America was crucially di fferent from \npolice law in British America. In the latter colonies, the bulk of the regu-lation was dra fted and issued in the colonies themselves, re \ufb02ecting the rel-\n120 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kiative independence of the British colonies from London. In the Spanish \ncolonies, however, the majority of the regulation continued to \ufb02ow from \nthe Council of the Indies right up to the end of colonial period, thus \nre\ufb02ecting the centralized nature of the Spanish Empire.\nAre we thus entitled to speak of a globalization of police regulation? This \nmay have to await further studies on Dutch, French, and Portuguese colonial laws. At the moment, in any case, it seems fair to assume that in the early \nmodern period, police regulation became at least thoroughly westernized.\nBibliography\nBarrientos Grand \u00f3n,Javier (2000), Historia del derecho indiano del desbubri-\nmiento colombino a la codi \ufb01caci\u00f3n, vol.

Owensby\nThe Theater of Conscience in the \u201cLiving Law\u201d\nof the Indies\nI\nIn early September 1690, Juan Rodr\u00edguez, a royal notary, accompanied Span-\niard Juan Moreno de Acevedo, owner of an obraje in Puebla, to an open \ufb01eld \nbetween the Indian towns of Santa Ana Acolco and Santa B\u00e1rbara Tamasul-co, in the parish of Santa Mar\u00eda Nativitas, Tlaxcala. Rodr\u00edguez had been charged by the\naudiencia in Mexico City with conducting a legal ceremony \nthat was supposed to o fficially put Moreno into possession of the land as his \nown. On its face, this was to have been a routine proceeding. But all did not \ngo according to plan. The audiencia had issued its order pursuant to a lawsuit \nbetween Moreno and the residents of Santa Ana and Santa B\u00e1rbara. In the \nlate 1670s, Moreno had bought an hacienda adjoining the towns. He had \nthen claimed certain lands as part of his purchase, lands which the towns insisted were theirs from \u201ctime immemorial, \u201d as one witness put it. Indian \nlitigants relied on two sources to bolster their assertion: a map showing the \nboundaries of town lands and\nt\u00edtulos y recaudos , or notarized documents, \nsome in Nahuatl, dating to 1597 and establishing uncontested transmission from 1624 to 1663. Moreno had \ufb01rst pressed his claim in 1679, shortly a fter \nbuying the\nhacienda adjacent to the towns. In 1682 he had obtained an order \nfrom the audiencia awarding him a particular piece of land, alleging that he \nhad bought the parcel in question. Much litigation followed over the inter-vening years.\nSo when in early September the two Spaniards arrived at the site that \nRodrig\u00faez, in his notarial capacity, had noticed and were met by a group of indignant residents from Santa Ana and Santa B\u00e1rbara, there was a long history of suspicion between parties. In their September 1690 petition for a protective writ of\namparo , the Indians stated that Rodr\u00edguez had noticed that \nthe land on which they stood did not match the parcel described in the \naudiencia\u2019s order favoring Moreno. In the discharge of his notarial obliga-\nThe Theater of Conscience in the \u201cLiving Law\u201d of the Indies 125tion, Rodr\u00edguez had looked at the document describing Moreno\u2019s claim, \nnoting boundary markers and other telltale signs, and had concluded that \nhe could not match the description to the land on which he was standing. At \nthat point, the two Spaniards had argued. A fter heated words, Rodr\u00edguez \ntold Moreno that he would not \u201cburden his conscience\u201d by awarding the land erroneously. He refused to conclude the ceremony and le ft.H em a y  \nhave known that Moreno and the towns had been disputing this land for \nsome time and that the Indians had long claimed to have possessed and \ncultivated it before Moreno bought the\nhacienda next door.\nTemporarily thwarted by Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s act of conscience, Moreno sought \nanother notary to execute the order and put him in possession. The o fficers \nfrom Santa Ana and Santa B\u00e1rbara then \ufb01led their September 1690 petition \nwith the audiencia arguing that Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s initial refusal to proceed with \nthe ceremony demanded the suspension of the subsequent order until the matter of which land was being referred to could be cleared up and the towns\u2019 legal claim settled. The audiencia agreed, rescinding its earlier order in favor of Moreno. To ensure the Indians were not dispossessed without a \nhearing, the\naudiencia dispatched a juez receptor ,aj u d g ew i t has p e c i a lc o m -\nmission answerable directly to the audiencia , who ordered Moreno not to \nplow the land or bother the Indian residents, on pain of a 500-peso \ufb01ne. This \norder would remain in place pending further litigation.1\nSuch an explicit reference to an act of \u201cconscience\u201d in a legal proceeding \nwas not common during this or any period of viceregal history, at least not in \nthe documents I have seen. Indeed, this is the most explicit one I have found in an actual court record.\n2Yet \u201cconscience\u201d was vital to the workings of law \nand justice in Spanish America. In any viable legal order, individual human \nbeings must make judgments about how to act in relation to the laws, \ncustoms, procedures, rules, doctrines and facts that underwrite legal out-comes \u2013 whether awarding land, parsing contractual agreements regarding labor, property or money, interrogating witnesses, enforcing royal decrees governing political arrangements, making restitution, imposing \ufb01nes, or \ndetermining the guilt and punishment of criminal defendants. This essay takes Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s moment of conscience seriously on its own terms. I see his \n1Agnt127 (1a pte.).2 and (2a pte.).1. Ultimately, the town o fficials were awarded the land, \nbut not until 1706. A gnt 226 (2a pte.).21.37.\n2 The word did appear in other legal documents, especially testaments.\n126 Brian P . Owensbyrefusal to proceed, and the reason he gave for it, as an occasion to think \nthrough the role and implications of conscience in the legal relationship \nbetween Spaniards and Indians, and between the king and his indigenous \nvassals in the New World. My chief aim is to see past the explicit rules, conventions or doctrines that govern ed everyday matters of law and focus \non the spirit of judgment that animated relations between Spaniards and I n d i a n si nt h ec o n t e x to fi m p e r i a lr u l e .Iw i l la l s oe x p l o r eh o wt h a ts p i r i tw a s  \nexpressed in relation to and came to be challenged by the expanding role of \nself interest in social life between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries.\nMy point of departure is V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui\u2019s reaction against the \nmodernist assumption that law can be understood chie \ufb02y in terms of its \n\u201csystematic\u201d qualities \u2013 explicit rules, procedures and legal norms as the \nbaseline for how law\nworks . Rather, Tau reminds us that law\u2019s role in a society \ndepends as much on the \u201cspirit\u201d governing legal interactions as on the \nmechanics of a given legal arrangement. By \u201cspirit\u201d Tau means the \u201cdeep strata of a society\u2019s mentality and culture, \u201d its\nideas, convictions and beliefs. \nA historical inquiry into the spirit of law demands that we attend to the \nways philosophy, religion, morality, ethics, economy and politics are inter-\nwoven with technical issues of legality in a particular place, at a particular \ntime, in a particular historical context.3With Tau, thus, I see Derecho Indiano\n\u2013 the Law of the Indies \u2013 more as a yielding and adaptive framework than as a rigid structure of tightly mortised connections, at least \u2013 until the end of \nthe Hapsburg period of Spanish imperial rule in the Indies.\nTau\u2019s seminal contribution to our understanding of Derecho Indiano is \nhis distinction between\ncasuistry andsystem . Employing these two \u201ccategorial \nconcepts\u201d \u2013 not quite ideal types \u2013 Tau argues that early Spanish imperial law was essentially casuistic, rooted not in abstract norms or doctrines, but in \nattention to the individual\ncase and its particularities. He is as concerned \nwith casuistry as a \u201csocial belief\u201d underlying all legal thought and action as he is with casuistry as a speci \ufb01c hermeneutical device. Through the sixteenth \nand seventeenth centuries and culminating in the nineteenth century, Tau \nclaims, this understanding of law gave way to a more system-oriented sen-\nsibility emphasizing technical matters and positive law over close attention to the peculiarities of each the peculiarities of each unique set of facts. \n3Tau(1992) 9, 11.\nThe Theater of Conscience in the \u201cLiving Law\u201d of the Indies 127According to Tau, we have misunderstood early law by assuming that the \nmove from case-based casuistry to systemic positive-law represented a telesis \nfrom traditional to modern notions of law, o ften represented as a normative \naccomplishment of the European Enlightenment. This has made it almost \nimpossible to engage Derecho Indiano on its own terms, for the \u201cspirit, \u201d \n\u201cbeliefs\u201d\u2019 and \u201cconvictions\u201d that Tau argues were at the core of legality in \nDerecho Indiano are largely bracketed out of discussions on contemporary \nsystems of law.4\nBy looking to legal treatises, training manuals, primers, as well as philo-\nsophical, religious and political texts, Tau makes a powerful argument for seeing case-based casuistry as the means by which Spanish rule attended to the realities of the New World and its peoples.\n5Legal decision makers were \ncharged \ufb01rst with looking to the empirical and experiential side of trans-\nactions and disputes. Their duty was not to the law as such, or to any sense of abstract legal consistency, but to\njusticia ,a n ds p e c i \ufb01cally to producing just \noutcomes in light of all the circumstances. Each case was di fferent and could \nnot be otherwise; no rule could be universal because each case was a law \nunto itself \u2013 a medieval theological idea that can be traced back to Aristotle \u2013 \nperhaps especially amidst the wild diversity of circumstances in the New World.\nThough legal o fficers had to exercise conscience in all of their dealings \u2013 \nwhether deposing witnesses, disposing of civil lawsuits, judging guilt and \npunishment in criminal matters, or deciding whether and what to notarize \u2013 \nTau has little to say about conscience as such. Though he refers to \u201c\nconciencia \u201d \nin passing while discussing \u201cthe world of moral cases\u201d and probabilism in the introduction to\nCasuismo y Sistema , and to \u201crectitude of conscience\u201d as \none of the requirements for a \u201cgood judge\u201d in his \ufb01nal chapter, he does not \ndevelop conciencia as a theme.6In this essay, I argue that conscience was a \ncrucial animating force of Spanish imperial law and speci \ufb01cally of Derecho \nIndiano . For a time it represented a precept of right and just interpretation in \nthe face of ever-present temptations to excess and self-dealing among the \nking\u2019s judges, corregidores ,alcaldes mayores ,receptores and notaries. In political \nand legal treatises and confession manuals, conciencia connected what was \n4 I have made a similar point in O wensby (2008).\n5Tau(1992) 19 (quoting Garc\u00eda-Gallo).\n6Tau(1992) 58, 60, 488.\n128 Brian P . Owensbyknown as the fuero interior \u2013 the interior court of the soul\u2019s sense of right and \nwrong \u2013 to the fuero exterior of the soul\u2019s sense of right and wrong to the \nfuero exterior of positive law enshrined in royal decrees, ordinances and \naccepted legal practices and customs. As such, conciencia was part of the \nmatrix of doctrinal and institutional restraints characteristic of Spanish vice-\nregal legality, such as overlapping and competing jurisdictions, the right of appeal to the viceroy and the king and, crucially for the Indians, the ability \nto seek a protective writ known as the\namparo ,w h i c he ffectively preserved \na factual status quo until a full hearing on a matter could be held.7While \nit is true that individuals o ften ignored conciencia , the fact that casuistry \ngrounded legal thinking and practice in Derecho Indiano , as Tau argues, \nmeant that proper conduct in accord with conscience was universally recog-n i z e da sa no b l i g a t i o no fa l lm i n i s t e r so fj u s t i c e\u2013e v e ni fm a n yo ften laid \ntheir duty aside.\nConciencia , therefore, is better understood as a belief (creencia ) \u2013 \u201ca deep \nand elemental manifestation of facing reality, more vital than intellectual, of \nwhich little or nothing is said and which [is] considered to be a basic premise \nof the society\u201d \u2013 than an idea announced and proven by means of a precise \nintellectual operation. \u201d8It h i n ko f conciencia as a self-e ffacing principle, a \ndeep re \ufb02ex expressing the conviction that ultimately men and their judg-\nments, rather than unmediated impersonal norms, sustained the project of \ngoverning human communities. Following Tau, this re \ufb02ex began to lose \nmeaning as a new spirit of abstraction and distrust for casuistic thinking and its emphasis on the particular took root in the soil of European juris-prudence from the late seventeenth century onward, a process that ran parallel to the emergence of economic concerns at the core of all social \nand political thought.\nII\nAs an intellectual, or at least de \ufb01nitional matter, there was little disagree-\nment on the meaning of conscience among early-modern Spanish jurists.

Ultimately, the \ndistinction goes back to O rtega y Gasset (1986).\nThe Theater of Conscience in the \u201cLiving Law\u201d of the Indies 129or certainty or near certainty of that which in our souls is bad or good. \u201d To be \nwithout conscience was to be \u201cwithout a soul. \u201d To act without conscience \nwas to have \u201cno scruple. \u201d9The Diccionario de autoridades published between \n1724\u20131739 by the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola retained this de \ufb01nition and \ncommented that \u201c[j]ust as nothing gives more life to hope than good con-\nscience, so one of the things that most tears down [ derrumba ]a n ds a p s  \n[desmaya ] the vitality of hope is bad conscience. \u201d The Diccionario supplied \na further gloss, noting that to \u201ccharge one\u2019s conscience\u201d was to demand that a thing be done \u201cwith knowledge, rectitude and without trickery, malice or fraud. \u2026 And so we\ncharge the consciences of judges. \u201d10\nThis connection between conscience and legal decision making was \nhardly new in the early eighteenth century. In his 1612 Arte legal para estudiar \nla jurisprudencia , Francisco Berm\u00fadez de Pedraza argued that law \u2013 ius\u2013w a s  \nessentially homologous to conscience, for it was the \u201cart, that is knowledge\u201d of the good and the bad within society. This knowledge called upon legal decision makers to deal honestly with their fellows, live by a commitment not to harm others, and above all dedicate themselves to the idea that each \nperson was entitled to that which was properly theirs (\nac a d au n ol os u y o ). \nWhile justicia rested \ufb01rmly on these three pillars, a \u201cconstant and perpetual \nwill\u201d was necessary to ground the last of them, for justice was \u201ca habit \nconceived in the soul of men. \u201d And though laws varied by time, land, and nation, said Berm\u00fadez, justice was \u201cone, constant and perpetual. \u201d Jurists and \njudges \u2013 and by extension all charged with producing binding legal e ffects \u2013 \nwere \u201ctrue priests, not of the habit but of the soul, employing equity and \njustice\u201d to defend the law \u2013\nla ley \u2013 \u201cfortress of the universe. \u201d Who would \nprotect the poor, the orphans, the widows, the prisoners, the pilgrims if \nthere were no law?, asked Berm\u00fadez. Law was \u201cthe soul of the Republic\u201d \nand jurisprudence the guarantor of \u201chuman happiness. \u201d11\nIn effect, every royal offi cer of the law and every churchman acting \nthrough the king\u2019s power under the Patronato bore a responsibility to see \nthat justice was done. The will and obligation to justice lay especially heavy \non those charged by training, vocation and duty with the defense of royal \nlaw.

By these \nappointments he \u201cdischarged his conscience\u201d in service to \u201cthe administra-tion of justice. \u201d\n13Failure to act in light of the royal conscience amounted to a \nkind of internal subversion of justice and thus of political order. As Jer\u00f3nimo de Ceballos put it in his\nArte real para el buen gobierno de los reyes, y pr\u00edncipes \nde sus vasallos (1613), the \u201ctribunal of justice\u201d was the \u201c \ufb01rm chain and \ncolumn on which rests the Empire, with which the good consonance and harmony of political government is assured, the master of political and social \nlife \u2026\u201d Aristotle had noted that the destruction of the Republic followed \nfrom a failure to maintain \u201cjustice, \u201d a \u201chabit of the soul that conserves public utility\u201d and enables the king and his o ffic e r st o\u201c r e s i s t\u2026t h ep e o p l eo fp o w e r  \nin the Republic. \u201d As such, justice was the \u201cjoy of the a fflicted, solace of the \npoor and unprotected and medicine for the soul\u201d for it \u201chumiliated the \narrogant\u201d and \u201cli fted up the humble. \u201d\n14Law, in its broadest understanding, \nserved as a counterweight to power within the social order. St. Thomas, \nnoted Berm\u00fadez, had made the point long ago: \u201cThe unbridled greed of men would pervert all things if justice did not check their appetites with the \nbit of its laws. \u201d\n15\nAccording to Friar Luis de Le\u00f3n in his widely-read De los nombres de Cristo\n(1583), government by men could not match Christ\u2019s perfect government. \nYet the spirit of the \u201cliving law\u201d that characterized divine governance could guide human a ffairs, so long as men in positions of political power heeded \n12 See Recopilaci\u00f3n de leyes delos reynos de las Indi as, 1680, (lib.tit.ley) 1.1.5; 1.6.28; 1.7.13; \n1.7.30; 1.7.53; 1.19.1; 2.2.31; 2.3.8; 4.1.2; 5.5. 2; 5.14.7; 6.2.9; 6.5.1; 6.10.7; 6.12.24; 6.15.7.\n13 C astillo de Bobadilla (1750) 207, 222.\n14 Z evallos (2003) 59r, 62v, 66v.\n15 B erm\u00fadez de Pedraza (1612) 12\u201313, 27.\nThe Theater of Conscience in the \u201cLiving Law\u201d of the Indies 131the pastoral call to care for those in their charge \u201caccording to the particular \nconditions of each one. \u201d16Their job was not an easy one.

Not only were the souls of individuals at \nrisk; the republic itself faced genuine danger.\nA sense of moral hazard hung over all legal a ffairs in the New World. \nBetween the mid-sixteenth and the mid-seventeenth centuries, Friars Barto-lom\u00e9 de las Casas (Dominican), Alonso de Molina (Franciscan) and Jer\u00f3ni-\nmo Moreno (Dominican) insisted that confessors attend to the \u201cjuridical \ncharacter of confession\u201d in deciding proper penitence for all ministers of justice who wished to ease their consciences, make their souls ready for communion and ensure their salvation.\n19As legal historian Andr\u00e9s Lira \nhas argued, these men, writing from deep moral shock and political disquiet \nat the treatment of Indians by the Spaniards during the \ufb01rst century a fter \nconquest, opened the privacy of the confessional to the public realm by \ninsisting that confessors withhold absolution from all who sinned against God by violating or ignoring positive law.\n20Put another way, these three \nwriters insisted on a vital connection between conscience and public obliga-\ntion: to violate the law, or to fail to uphold it was to sin against God and absolution depended on heartfelt contrition and a willingness to right the wrong.\nThis connection expressed a well-established political idea: that the king\u2019s \ngreat task was to rule according to\nconciencia , implying the convergence of \nprivate and public concerns at the very core of political order. This notion pointed to a critical role for confessors. As Robert Bellarmine noted in his \nOn the Duties of a Christian Prince Toward His Confessor (1513),\u201c[n]ot without \nr e a s o nd ow ep l a c et h ep r i e s t - c o n f e s s o ro ft h ep r i n c ea m o n gt h o s ep e o p l e  \n16 L e\u00f3n (1917) 115.\n17 C astillo de Bobadilla (1750) 137, 222.\n18 See S ol\u00f3rzano y Pereira (1996) III, 1873\u20131874 (5.2.17/24/25).\n19 L iraGonz\u00e1lez (2006) 1139\u20131178.\n20 L iraGonz\u00e1lez (2006).\n132 Brian P . Owensbywhom the prince should consider as his superiors. For the priest, in hearing \nthe confessions of the powerful (regardless of whether they are princes or \np r i v a t ep e r s o n s ) ,a c t sa saj u d g ei nt h ep l a c eo fG o da n dh a st h ep o w e ro f  \nbinding or loosening in the sphere of conscience. \u2026 [T]he prince\u2019s eternal salvation depends, to a remarkable degree, on his confessor. \u201d This was not merely a matter of contrition for private acts: a prince\u2019s confession solely to \u201csins that relate to him as a private person\u201d is not a full confession if he \u201cskips \nover the sins he has committed as prince. \u201d This implicated all of the king\u2019s \nofficers, and especially those charged with dispensing justice. As Bellarmine \nnoted, a king\u2019s confession to narrow sins of commission or omission should not satisfy if the confessor knows \u201chow badly his administrators are behaving in administering the country. \u201d\n21\nTwo notions followed from this proposition. First, the king needed to \nattend closely to what his o fficers were doing; he had a duty to ensure that \nthey were behaving properly in the public, political realm, chie \ufb02yb yo b e y -\ning and enforcing the law justly. Second, all who operated with the color of the king\u2019s authority should be held to a standard of conscience that recog-\nnized their public role vis-\u00e0-vis the law. Lira puts it this way: \u201cConscience, \nbeginning with the king\u2019s, was the premise and preoccupation of that public order in which Christian government was considered the only legitimate one and had to be on display at all times. \u201d\n22So when Las Casas in his \nConfesionario of 1545 demanded that confessors refuse absolution unless \nconquistadores and encomenderos made restitution for the harm they had \ncaused the Indians, he was extending Bellarmine\u2019s point regarding the dual private-public role of the prince to all those in the New World who acted in t h ek i n g \u2019 sn a m eo rb yt h ek i n g \u2019 sl i c e n s e .I ne ffect, the fate of their souls \ndepended on satisfying the demands of conscience by confessing and rem-edying wrongs made possible by the fact that they held o ffice.\n23The goal, of \ncourse, was that they obey and uphold the law, and thereby not succumb to sin; if they had sinned by violating the law, then they were obliged to make \n21 From B ellarmino (2006) 223.\n22 L iraGonz\u00e1lez (2006) 1158.\n23 L iraGonz\u00e1lez (2006) 1151.

In practical e ffect, Las Casas was insisting that conscience have a \nrole in everyday political life in a place where so many people \u2013 especially the \nIndians \u2013 were vulnerable to the wiles of the powerful.\nAlonso de Molina took this notion one step further in his Confesionario \nmayor en lengua mexicana y castellana (1578), instructing confessants to con-\nsider their conduct a fter taking on some \u201co ffice of lordship and gover-\nnance. \u201d24Confessors were to ask offi ce holders seeking absolution whether \nthey had issued unjust sentences or ruled against claimants because of a bribe \nor out of \u201cgreed. \u201d25Such an o fficer was obliged to make good those who had \nbeen hurt. But Molina did not stop at the most banal sorts of wrongdoings. He held ministers of justice to a higher standard. Thus, a proper confessional \u201cinquisition\u201d would press penitent judges on whether they had \u201cdisturbed or \nimpeded\u201d petitioners from appealing or seeking justice at the\naudiencia ,o r  \nhad not received them \u201cgently\u201d with the intent of helping them, but instead \n\u201cquarreled with them and dismissed them\u201d so that they \u201cwould not dare to come before you. \u201d\n26The softsin of turning people away from law was just as \nerosive of justice as feckless inattention to the demands of o ffice or the more \nhard-edged corruption of outright avarice. A confessant was always respon-sible for the state of his conscience, public as well as private, and so was obliged to \u201crectitude, justice and prudence\u201d in all his a ffairs.\n27In broader \nterms, this is what Barcelona printer Sebasti\u00e1n Cormellas meant in his ded-ication of Manoel Rodrigues\u2019 1596\nSumma de casos de conciencia con adver-\ntencias muy provechosas para confessores con un orden iudicial a la postre ,w h e r e  \nhe insisted that anything that \u201cbene \ufb01ts conscience aids the republic. \u201d28\nWith the publication in 1637 of Jer\u00f3nimo Moreno\u2019s Reglas ciertas y pre-\ncisamente necesarias para iuezes y ministros de justicia de las Indias y para sus \nconfesores , the process begun in the mid-sixteenth century that gradually \nbound conscience to positive law for those who held o ffice and exercised \npower through the king\u2019s political auth ority reached its culmination. This is \nLira\u2019s seminal point. In Moreno as in Las Casas and Molina, the confessional \nbridged the gap between private life and public.

Owensbythe plight of the Indians, this was a welcome development. Mart\u00edn Acosta y \nMezquita, audiencia lawyer and advocate for the poor and prisoners in \nMexico City, wrote a foreword to the Reglas ciertas . Bemoaning the sad state \nof the Indians, he congratulated Moreno for his proposal that those charged \nwith ensuring royal justice be held to account in the court of conscience. It was, said Acosta, a measured response to the fact that royal decrees had been so often ignored by those trusted with enforcing them. As Pope Pius V had \nonce noted: \u201cGrant me that confessors will do their jobs as they should and I will give you Christian government maintained in peace and tranquility. \u201d\n29\nFor Moreno, the temptations even of petty power in the New World were so great that \u201cministers of justice\u201d were under a heavy burden of conscience and thus liable to confess even the smallest misstep in their relations with the \nIndians. This was not simply a matter of rendering judgment in cases at law. It touched every economic, contractual, adjudicative and administrative action ministers of justice might take under color of royal authority, from property agreements, to labor allocations, to tribute collection, to election mediations, to prices paid and charged pursuant to the\nrepartimiento de \nmercanc\u00edas . In all things, they were obliged strictly to observe the King\u2019s \nlaws. So that even if he otherwise acted justly, a minister sinned by entering into any business or contract with his charges for his own bene \ufb01t, because \nthere was a royal decree forbidding it.\n30The obligation ran further still. As \nLira notes, Moreno\u2019s \u201cFirst Rule\u201d for conf essors (of thirty) states that anyone \nwho tells a minister of justice that he may legally have personal business dealings with the Indians is himself in mortal sin pending confession and restitution, because the law clearly forbids such dealings; enabling or even condoning sin was itself sinful, for otherwise ministers of justice would duck \nlegal prohibitions by claiming that they had been assured in conscience by \ntheir confessors that they could act as they did.\n31\nFor Moreno, mere procedural correctness was never enough to satisfy the \nspirit of the living law, rooted in natural and divine precepts, to which all ministers of justice owed their conscientious attention. This is what accounts \n29 M oreno (1637). See also M ayagoit\u00eda (1996).\n30 M oreno (1637) 19.

Las Siete Partidas de\ufb01ned \n\u201cfuero \u201d as law properly used, something akin to jurisdiction. Etymologically \nthe word derived from the Latin forum and according to Covarrubias it was \nequivalent to the Castillian plaza , \u201c b e c a u s et r i a l sa n dh e a r i n g sw e r ec o n -\nducted in the most public places of the city and where there was the greatest \ncongregation of people. \u201d32In the early eighteenth century, the Diccionario de \nautoridades gave as a \ufb01rst de \ufb01nition of \u201c fuero \u201d the \u201claw or particular statute of \nsome kingdom or province\u201d encompassing the \u201cuse and custom\u201d character-\nistic of that place, pointing to the locative quality of all law.33Covarrubias \ndid not refer to \u201c fuero de la conciencia , \u201d but Sol\u00f3rzano y Pereira did in the \nPol\u00edtica indiana in 1648 and linked it to \u201cmortal sin\u201d and a duty of restitution \n(with regard to the obligation to pay tribute). The Diccionario de autoridades\ndid offer an entry for \u201cfuero de la conciencia, \u201d giving as a de \ufb01nition \u201cthe \ntribunal of reason, which directs and arranges the operations of man, abso-lutely according to divine and human laws. \u201d\n34In essence, by distinguishing \nbetween the fuero exterior and the fuero de la conciencia ,M o r e n ow a sm a k i n g  \nthe point that public laws in the political world ultimately could not be meaningful instruments of justice un less those charged with keeping them \nwere bound by an inner compulsion to abide by their spirit, not merely by their external formulation.\nThe crucial point, as with the notion of\nfuero generally, was that one could \nnot be reduced to the other. The two fueros were intimately related, though ultimately each held to what was properly its own. The\nfuero exterior was the \nrealm of positive law and royal decrees interpreted and applied by ministers \nof justice, where power and rights o ften butted heads. In the fuero de la \nconciencia the confessor was in charge and confessants answered to a higher \nstandard of judgment. Thus, because \u201cin the fuero exterior as i nc a nb e  \nabsolved without absolving other sins\u201d and \u201ceveryone should confess. \u201d For \nthe \u201cjudge of the republic is a judge for the community, and so his judgment \nmust be for the community, according to proof \u2026 [B]ut the confessor is a \n32 C ovarrubias (1674) part.

Owensbyparticular judge, next to God. \u201d As such, the confessor is charged not only \nwith hearing the penitent\u2019s words but also attending to \u201cparticular knowl-\nedge\u201d regarding the state of the penitent\u2019s soul. As Moreno pointed out, a \nminister of justice who has come to confess may not rely on the completion of a post-tenure\nresidencia t oc l a i mt h a th ei sf r e ef r o mf u r t h e rd e m a n d s ,  \nbecause \u201che is not free in the fuero de la conciencia \u201d until he has made \nrestitution to those he has harmed, regardless of the outcome of the resi-\ndencia. This was true even if those harmed \u2013 usually Indians \u2013 had come to \nsome sort of settlement with the outgoing o fficer, because such agreements \ntended to be \u201cviolent and against their will\u201d or the result of fraud.35And \neven if the residencia was entirely above board, confessants could not claim \nabsolution merely by asserting lawful behavior; they owed an ineluctable \nduty of conscience to the spirit of the law in the fuero exterior .\nIII\nThis appeal to conscience can seem quaint, even quixotic at a time when it was commonly said that \u201cself-interest accomplishes all. \u201d\n36Life, it struck \nmany contemporaries in the seventeenth century, had become lonely, brut-\nish, competitive and petty, an arena of \u201cdistrust and suspicion\u201d in which there were no true friends because everyone was involved in a \u201cperpetual war, without any sort of truce or peace \u201d and each person pursued only \u201chis \nown business and not the common and good of all. \u201d This was thought to be especially so in the New World, where Indians were the object of the Span-iards\u2019 (and others\u2019) manipulative fantasies and abusive energies.\n37The point \nwas not lost on the theological moralists who sought some way to ensure \nthat royal o fficers were governed by conscience in their o fficial lives. In a \npostscript to his Reglas ciertas , Moreno detailed the extent to which \u201cunfaith-\nful ministers of justice\u201d \u201co ffe n d e da n da g g r i e v e dt h em a j e s t yo fG o da n do f  \nthe king\u201d by their treatment of the Indians. The majority of judges and \nministers of justice did not confess because \u201ctheir consciences did not gnaw \n35 M oreno ( 1 6 3 7 )1 2 r ,1 8 v ,4 7 v ,4 9 v ,5 0 r ,5 1 r .\n36 A non., Romance a M\u00e9xico.\n37 See O wensby (2008) 29 n. 68 (Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, Darlo todo y no dar nada ,a c tI ) ;2 9  \nn. 69 (Su\u00e1rez Figueroa, El pasajero: advertencias util\u00edsimas a la vida humana (1617), Saave-\ndra Fajardo, Empresas (emblema 43)); 30 n. 72; 30 n. 73 ( Romance a M\u00e9xico ).\nThe Theater of Conscience in the \u201cLiving Law\u201d of the Indies 137at them, \u201d a sign for Moreno of how unconcerned they were for the state of \ntheir souls and for the fate of the Republic.38\nSo why bother spelling out rules for confession in response to o fficial \nmisdoings if the people in question rarely confessed? For Moreno the answer was clear: far more than individual souls was at stake in the unconscionable behavior of\ncorregidores ,alcaldes mayores ,tenientes and other ministers of \njustice on the ground in the Indies. By their conduct, such o fficers not only \nviolated the king\u2019s law but sinned against the passion of Christ. They o ffered \nworse examples \u201ceven than the Gentiles, \u201d and by their \u201cambitions\u201d and \u201cgreed\u201d they threatened to \u201cundo what the savior accomplished through his death. \u201d As a result, some \u201cpoor and wretched Indians (those who are Christians) abandon the faith, and th o s ew h oa r en o tC h r i s t i a n sd on o tw a n t  \nto receive it, \u201d because those who have the \u201cobligation of justice, to sustain and ennoble it with Christian acts\u201d instead \u201cdiscredit and dishonor it with pagan works, scandalizing [the Indians] with trickery, the ftand the great \nblindness of greed, \u201d saying that \u201cas they are Indians they are not Christians, and it does not matter if they are tricked and robbed. \u201d\n39The individual souls \nof Indians and ministers of justice themselves were imperiled by such mal-feasance, insisted Moreno.\nWorse still, abuse by ministers of justice threatened the very fabric of New \nWorld society. If Indians fell away from the faith or would not receive it because of the mistreatment they su ffered, the kingdom itself was at risk, for \nas Sol\u00f3rzano y Pereira noted, the king\u2019s indigenous vassals were liable to pay just tributes to o ffset the cost of \u201ctheir evangelization and Christian gover-\nnance. \u201d\n40If the Indians were driven away from the church by the misdeeds \nof judicial o fficers and others, the rationale for tribute became tenuous, at \nleast in principle. Conciencia in Spain\u2019s imperial legal order, thus, should not \nbe understood solely in terms of whether it was e ffective in restraining \nundesired behavior by individual o fficers of the law \u2013 o ften it was not. \nRather, the concern for conscience expressed deep anxieties, about religious faith, good government, justice and right action in human a ffairs. At a time \nwhen human relations seemed increasingly instrumental and competitive, in a place where distant royal authority faced constant challenge by individual \n38 M oreno (1637) 54r\u201359r.\n39 M oreno (1637) 55v.\n40 S ol\u00f3rzano y Pereira (1996) I 435 (2.19.2).\n138 Brian P . Owensbyinterests on the ground and still-recent converts to Christianity struggled to \nshield themselves from the arrows of abuse that rained down on their lives, \nMoreno insisted that everyone be reminded of their obligations in the fuero \ninterior . Yet this was not a strictly interior matter, as Castilllo y Bobadilla \nnoted in his treatise on corregidores : Cicero had long ago pointed out that \nnothing was \u201cmore public, more rigorous and more faithful\u201d than the \u201cthe-\nater of conscience. \u201d41\nAlonso de Pe\u00f1a Montenegro\u2019s Itinerario para p\u00e1rrocos (1662\u201363), written \nfrom Pe\u00f1a\u2019s judicial experience in Quito, suggests something of the intricate action that took place on this proscenium that thrust into the exterior drama of the New World. An instruction manual for priests of Indian parishes in New Spain, the\nItinerario touches on every issue a pastor might face in \nministering to his \ufb02ock. The tome (running to over 500 pages), spared no \nink in discussing the challenges of conversion, idolatry and witchcra ft,o f  \ntribute and its collection, of justice among the Indians and between Indians and Spaniards, of the role natural law played in the lives of Indian subjects, and of the sacraments, including confession. It paid attention to the prickly \nrelationship between locally powerful Spaniards \u2013 land owners, miners, \nalcaldes mayores and their tenientes \u2013 and vulnerable Indian parishioners. \nConciencia ran like a bright thread through this tapestry of topics, reiterating \nthe idea raised by Las Casas, Molina and Moreno that confessors were to \nhold all Spaniards to high standards in the fuero interior ,e s p e c i a l l yt h o s e  \ncharged with speci \ufb01c duties by the king\u2019s law. Encomenderos had a duty of \nconscience to treat the Indians well, a principle enshrined in countless royal decrees.\n42Judges of residencia w e r eb o u n db yc o n s c i e n c et oh o l dm i n i s t e r so f  \njustice fully accountable, and to demand full restitution for harm done. \nThose who failed to do so were \u201cunjust judges, \u201d said Pe\u00f1a. Having accepted \nthe obligation to \u201cdischarge royal conscience, \u201d they were \u201ctraitors to their Lord and King, carried away by interest and suborned by money\u201d and so \u201capprove injustices and dissemble abuses\u201d of\ncorregidores and alcaldes mayo-\nres.43\nSuch charges against ministers of justice were a logical extension of the \nfact that the New World\u2019s Indians were obligated in the fuero interior of law \n41 C astillo de Bobadilla (1750) 418.\n42 P e\u00f1aMontenegro (1662) 242 (lib.

X).\nThe Theater of Conscience in the \u201cLiving Law\u201d of the Indies 139as well as in the fuero exterior to pay just tribute. Pe\u00f1a was clear. To be \u201cjust\u201d , \ntribute had to be measured and proportionate to the ability of the subjects to \npay, and always in relation to the bene \ufb01ts provided by the king, especially the \nadministration of justice.44As a consequence, the tributary obligation was \nnot unquali \ufb01ed. Indians subject to excessive or unauthorized tribute exac-\ntions, or to \u201cabuse and vexations\u201d by encomenderos ,corregidores ,I n d i a n caci-\nques, or parish priests, could with \u201cjust and rightful title\u201d \ufb02ee their jurisdic-\ntion. Having \ufb02ed, they were not bound in the \u201c fuero de conciencia \u201dt op a y  \ntribute they might otherwise have owed, for an abusive encomendero lost the \nright to demand tribute from his subjects (even if this meant loss to the \nCrown).45Nor were these Indians, or hacendados or others who might \nreceive them in another jurisdiction, liable to restitution of unpaid tribute \nin these circumstances.\nMoreover, the Indians\u2019 decision to pay tribute, like any other judgment at \nlaw, was casuistic. A long-established doctrine held that those who in the \nfuero exterior were too poor bore no obligation, in law or in conscience, to \npay tribute. The danger in this doctrine was obvious to Pe\u00f1a: if it were too easy for the Indians to claim poverty, \u201ceveryone would want to enter by this \ndoor and not pay tribute. \u201d Yet as natural law favored the poor, allowances had to be made for tributaries, and judges before whom they might appear had to consider \u201chow poor they are. \u201d A man who could not feed and clothe his family, was under no compulsion, interior or exterior, to pay tribute.\n46\nThere is a crucial point here. As Pe\u00f1a noted, obligation in the fuero exterior\no ft h el a ww a si n t e r t w i n e dw i t ha no b l i g a t i o ni nc o n s c i e n c e ,a sm u c hf o r  t r i b u t a r i e sa sa n y o n ee l s eb e a r i n gas p e c i \ufb01c legal duty to the king.

The burden of tribute was never absolute, for circumstances of abuse \nand poverty could justify non-payment. Even so, there is no doubt that decisions to suspend payment could be and o ften were instrumental. Yet \nas I have argued elsewhere, Indians involved in lawsuits made much of their \ntributary duties, embracing them to assert a kind of moral superiority over \n44 P e\u00f1aMontenegro (1662) 151 (lib.

OwensbySpaniards, especially encomenderos ,hacendados ,corregidores andalcaldes mayo-\nres,w h os oo ften ignored royal decrees protecting the Indians.48Indigenous \nlitigants advanced such claims understanding that willing acceptance of their \nduties in ordinary circumstances gave them a certain credibility when the time came to bring grievances before a judge. Individuals or whole villages might go before a judge to complain of excessive tribute exactions, to claim poverty in periods of trouble, or to argue that changed conditions \u2013 o ften \nepidemics or \ufb02ight from a village \u2013 made it impossible for them to adhere to \nprevious rates and schedules.\n49In doing so, they generally pointed to con-\nscientious payment during normal times and expressed a desire to return to recognized and customary arrangements disrupted by the greed of local tribute collectors or to adjust their obligation to match their circumstances.\nFrom Pe\u00f1a\u2019s perspective, Spaniards and Indians in the New World shared \nan obligation to act from conscience in matters of law, each according to his station in a hierarchy that bound all into a single political and moral project. Although it was established law by the seventeenth century that the Indians had the reason and discernment to exercise conscience, some Spaniards \ncontinued to contest the idea. For the most part, however, Spaniards and \nIndians alike appear to have recognized what conscience demanded. The Indians\u2019 status as men required it. And as Castillo de Bobadilla noted in his well-known\nPol\u00edtica para corregidores (1640), addressed to all judges, gov-\nernors, lawyers and \u201cother public o fficials, \u201d there are \u201csparks of original \n\ufb02ame\u201d in all men, which Christians call \u201cthe dictates of conscience. \u201d At \ntimes, conciencia \ufb01nds its path to virtue without \u201craciocination or acts of \nunderstanding, \u201d but for the most part it must be \u201cregulated by reason, and not by absolute will, and is not free of the censure of a superior, nor can one \nwho has the faculty to do an act, use it when the act is contrary to equity. \u201d\n50\nIn other words, conscience inheres in all men and compels them to right \nthinking in judging and discerning right and wrong, but it is neither a guarantee of proper conduct, nor a license for arbitrary acts of will. \u201cThe chief intent and aim which the good\nCorregidor must have\u201d \u2013 and by exten-\nsion anyone else under an obligation to the law and justice \u2013 \u201cis reverence for and observance of justice, as much in what he says and does as in that \n48 O wensby (2008) 67, 87, 299.\n49 P e\u00f1aMontenegro (1662) 250 (lib.

It was a theological requirement, political principle and moral pre-\ncept that had to obtain for society to live up to its divine purpose. Those who \nfailed to live by its \u201cdictates\u201d \u2013 and there were many \u2013 violated the very \nessence of Christ\u2019s passion, betrayed the King and threatened the order and stability of society.\nIV\nIn the Indies, where order depended on a delicate balance between the exploitation and protection of the king\u2019s indigenous subjects,\nconciencia\nwas a critical belief that gave a spark of life to legal decision making at all levels. Rarely mentioned in everyday judicial proceedings, it was frequently \ninvoked in legal treatises, confession manuals and the\nRecopilaci\u00f3n ,b r i d g i n g  \nreligious notions of sin and obligation to the duties of law in the fuero \nexterior , where power and interest were in play at all times. By the seven-\nteenth century, all of the king\u2019s subjects were bound by fearful and prin-\ncipled adhesion to the dictates of conscience in confronting the di fficult \nchoices implied in all a ffairs of law.\nThis is precisely what the representatives of Santa Ana and Santa B\u00e1rbara \nunderstood when they \ufb01led their petition in 1690. By that time they had \nbeen in litigation for at least eight years over the land Moreno claimed. Their \nsituation looked bleak, as Moreno had in hand an audiencia order awarding \nhim the parcel and he was prepared to start plowing. They understood that \nas soon as he did they were almost surely lost. With crops in the ground and his farmhands living there, the towns would be unlikely to recover the land, given that productive use and occupation constituted prima facie evidence of \nproper possession. This was why the Indians hustled to the\naudiencia to stop \nMoreno from working the land. They invoked their status as \u201cpoor and \npowerless\u201d people, \u201chumble vassals and tributaries, who a fter our powerful \n51 C astillo de Bobadilla (1750) 270 (lib. II, cap. II).\n142 Brian P . OwensbyGod have no other protection. \u201d They included with their petition a state-\nment sworn out in late August 1690 by the local priest, bachiller (university \ngraduate) Father Pedro Camacho de Campos Villavicencio who, in verbo \nsacerdotis ,i n s i s t e dt h a tM o r e n o \u2019 sc l a i mw a si m p r o p e r .T h el a n da b u t t e dt h e  \nIndians\u2019 church, said Camacho, \u201cwhere we continually celebrate the holy sacri\ufb01ce of the mass throughout the year\u201d as had been done \u201cfrom time \nimmemorial, \u201d and it encroached on their cemetery, \u201cwhere the faithful are \nburied. \u201d This amounted to a \u201cgrave off ense against God our Lord and pre-\njudice to the native Indians, who for so many years have lived and died as \nRoyal Tributaries of your Majesty and residents of said towns. \u201d\n52On the basis \nof this petition, the audiencia agreed to override its previous order and freeze \nthe status quo. So it remained for the next decade and a half until a terse \n1706 order awarded the towns the land that had been in dispute for over \ntwenty- \ufb01ve years.\nThe turning point of the case had been Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s refusal to \u201cburden his \nconscience\u201d by following an order that did not describe the landscape before him. He could have executed the document in hand and been on solid legal \nground. Many other notaries would h a v ed o n es o ;M o r e n of o u n da n o t h e r  \nwho did. But Rodr\u00edguez said no and walked away. Of course, there were \nother plausible reasons for refusing to execute the order. Rodr\u00edguez may \nsimply have wanted to avoid further trouble. He surely knew that the Indi-ans would not stand idly by, given the history of this litigation, and he may \nhave been worried about looking bad before the\naudiencia if he went ahead. \nAt the very least he might have been summoned to explain his decision to \nproceed in the face of Indian resistanc e; not a pleasant prospect under any \ncircumstance. A stand on conscience in favor of the Indians was unobjec-\ntionable at law and he may have anticipated that Moreno would do as he did \n\u2013 seek another notary to carry out the order \u2013 rather than complain to the \naudiencia about Rodr\u00edguez. This other notary may not have known much of \nthe litigation and may have executed the order as a pro forma matter; a fter \nall, the audiencia had spoken, and more than once. Then again, he may \nsimply have enjoyed greater moral \ufb02exibility than Rodr\u00edguez.\nThe explicit appeal to conciencia was not legally necessary for Rodr\u00edguez to \nwalk away. He could have asserted the fact that the description did not \n52 AGNT 127 (2a pte.).1, 223r\u2013v, 224r\u2013v.\nThe Theater of Conscience in the \u201cLiving Law\u201d of the Indies 143match the land in question and suspended proceedings tout court .Y e tR o d r \u00ed -\nguez\u2019s concern for conciencia was exactly what Lira says ministers of justice \nwere under a theological and moral compulsion to do from roughly the \nmid-seventeenth century onward \u2013 worry about the fuero interior when act-\ning as legal o fficers and understand that knowing error in the fuero exterior\nexposed them to penance and restitution.53We have no idea how God-\nfearing a man Rodr\u00edguez was, or whether he confessed on a regular basis. \nAs a royal notary he may well have been concerned, as his profession and \nduty required him to be, with doing right by the royal conscience. Though he probably had not reviewed the case record, he would have been familiar with the gist of the royal decree attached to a 1688 order favoring the residents of Santa Ana and Santa B\u00e1rbara. Citing sections of the\nRecopilaci\u00f3n , \nthat order stated that all o fficers of the king were obligated to \u201csee to the \nIndians who su ffer such great injustices and vexations \u2026 for of all my vassals \nthey are the ones who, by their tribute, most bene \ufb01ta n ds t r e n g t h e nm y  \nRoyal Crown. \u201d54Nor was the outcome on that September day just a matter \nof Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s act. Indian petitioners chose to highlight Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s state-\nment. In doing so, they were appealing not merely to the letter of the law, \nbut critically to the spirit of judgment and right conduct underlying it: a Royal Notary of good conscience rejected Moreno\u2019s bald-faced, self-serving attempt at fraud. The contrast could not have been sharper, which probably was the point.\nAt least in theory, order and justice in the Empire depended on this \ncontrast. We know that many did not hear the voice of conscience, or ignored it. The confessional was there to remind all who acted on behalf of the law that their decisions were not merely private matters and that there \nwas no hard boundary between the\nfuero interior and the fuero exterior .S o  \nwhile many ministers of justice did not confess and many who did doubtless \ndid so formulaically, the principle that conscience burdened all de \ufb01ned the \nlimits of permitted malfeasance and enabled victims of mistreatment to seek redress, especially if they could claim to have abided by the demands of \nconscience themselves. In e ffect,\nconciencia was part of a yielding web of \nmeanings and reliances that stood against unrestrained abuse. Corregidores , \n53 We need far more research on how and the extent to which o fficers of the law were \nsubject to penalties of restitution for wrongly decided cases.\n54 AGNT 127.(2a pate.).1, 204v\u2013205r.\n144 Brian P . Owensbycertainly, were the most prone to transgression, facing as they did the entic-\ning vulnerability of indigenous people. Those further from the source of \ntemptation, whose interests o ften ran against the open depredation of the \nIndians \u2013 such as ministers of tribute collection in Mexico City or Lima, \nroyal notaries and judges of special commission \u2013 might be more receptive to conscience. For conscience never s poke in a social or political vacuum. \nIt was an ethical baseline in a notoriously con \ufb02ictual world characterized by \nthe frequent disregard for legality and by unabashed self-regard, a\nbelief and \nconviction linking each vassal\u2019s immortal soul to the operations of law, the \nidea of justice, the king\u2019s authority and the good of society.\nIf, as Lira argues, the private consciences of public o fficials became a \nmatter of political concern during the seventeenth century, it was in \nresponse to a broad sense that the din of private interests \u2013 generally referred \nto by such words as codicia (greed) and inter\u00e9s (interest or self-interest) \u2013 was \ndrowning out the law\u2019s voice on behalf of justice and good government. This disquiet was hardly new. In Spain and the Indies, the \u201cuniversal confronta-tion of all, of some against others, \u201d as Maravall has argued, was characteristic \nof the long rupture between the Middle Ages and the emergence of a new, \n\u201cmodern\u201d way of being in the world.\n55For Tau, this was the same period in \nwhich casuistry , as a basis for legality, began to give way to system inDerecho \nIndiano . If older assumptions and understandings held through much of the \nseventeenth century, in part by insisting on the relevance of conscience, as \nLira suggests, it was against the run of historical processes rooted in the \ngrowing commercialization of society as a whole from the \ufb01fteenth century \nonward.\nBy the middle of the eighteenth century, economic concerns had taken \ncenter stage in reformist debates within Spanish realms. The arbitristas of the \nlate seventeenth century and early eighteenth century wrote chie \ufb02ya b o u t  \ntrade and the imperial \ufb01sc. Reformist minister Jos\u00e9 del Campillo y Cosio in \nhis 1741 Nuevo sistema de gobierno econ\u00f3mico para la Am\u00e9rica focused on \neconomic structures and policies, and sought to recast the role of indigenous \npeople in the Empire as the only viable basis for rescuing the imperial system \nfrom collapse. For Campillo, law was to be oriented toward \u201cthe good economy of the state\u201d rather than toward the \u201cpolitical\u201d and just governance \n55 M aravall (1975) 341.\nThe Theater of Conscience in the \u201cLiving Law\u201d of the Indies 145of society \u2013 i. e., the \u201cgood order that is observed and kept in Cities and \nRepublics, by enforcing laws and ordinances established for their good gov-\nernment. \u201d56Without acknowledging it, perhaps because he could not grasp \nthe full implications of his language, good government , once linked tightly to \njustice , had become a matter of \u201cgood order\u201d above all. And if Campillo\u2019s \nprescriptions were thought extreme in 1741, elements of his economic pro-\ngram, and signi \ufb01cant elements of his reasoning and his meanings, became \ncommon sense by the late eighteenth century in the context of the Bourbon reforms.\n57\nTwo documents written in 1749 in Peru hint at an indigenous perspective \ncrosswise to Campillo\u2019s optimism that a \u201csystem of economic government\u201d could displace justice in resolving the tensions of imperial rule. In the\nVer-\ndadera relaci\u00f3n y exclamaci\u00f3n and the Breve y compendiosa satisfacci\u00f3n ,F r i a r  \nCalixto de San Jos\u00e9 T\u00fapac Inca, who claimed descent from the last Inca, addressed himself in the form of a Lamentation and Jeremiad to the newly enthroned Ferdinand VI regarding the plight of the \u201cAmerican Indians. \u201d He catalogued the abuses of Spanish landowners, miners and offi cials, noting \nthat the Indians,\u201cinnumerable vassals\u201d and \u201cmost faithful subjects, \u201d had been abandoned by their King and Lord to the tender mercies of greedy Spaniards guided only by self interest.\n58The answer proposed by Friar Calixto was not \nCampillo\u2019s turn to \u201ceconomic government\u201d but instead to shore up \u201claw and justice\u201d by cashiering Spanish\ncorregidores and allowing the Indians to elect \ntheir own judges and conduct their own legal a ffairs, separate from the \nSpaniards \u2013 a jurisdictional solution. Only in this way could the Empire \u201cput into practice a Christian, Catholic and proper justice, that is to say, law and reason\u201d that would ensure the \u201csouls of all [the king\u2019s] vassals, \nSpaniards as well as Indians. \u201d Thus would Spaniards \u201cbe relieved of weighty \nburdens of conscience, \u201d for though \u201cthey may gain gold and silver\u201d by their self-regarding actions they are le ftwith \u201cheavy faults of conscience and \n56 C ampillo y Cosio (1789) 4; Diccionario de autorida des (1969) III 311\u2013312. There has \nbeen some debate about whether Campillo wrote this tract. See N avarro Garc\u00eda\n(1983); N avarro Garc\u00eda (1995).\n57 A rtola (1952); S tein /Stein (2010) 231\u2013259; S tein /Stein (2003); T iryakian (1978) \n233\u2013257.\n58 Clamor de los Indios Americanos 81 (15v). There is some debate about authorship of \nthese two documents, though Friar Calixto was punished for them. See D ue\u00f1as (2010) \n75\u201378.\n146 Brian P . Owensbysoul. \u201d59In essence, where Campillo looked at a world of self-interest and \nconcluded that the only solution was to give the Indians free rein or even \nf o r c et h e mt oa c tf r o mt h es a m ei m p u l s e ,F r i a rC a l i x t ot o o kt h ev i e wt h a t  \njustice pursuant to the royal conscience was all that could stand between the Indians and those who would trample them and call it good government.\nGiven the burdens economic processes and legal systems have imposed \non vulnerable people in the modern age, perhaps Friar Calixto had a point. \nIn the affairs of men, the voice of\nconciencia is never silent. But historical \nprocesses can produce understandings that drown it out, or make it sound \nthready and irrelevant in the grander schemes of human activity. This is one way to think about what happened between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, as Europe, both within and in its contacts with worlds outside \nitself, underwent the \u201cgreat transformation\u201d that brought economic systems to the center of social and political thinking.\n60Acute observers \u2013 such as Las \nCasas, Molina, Moreno, Pe\u00f1a, Castillo and Friar Calixto \u2013 sensed what was happening without fully compassing it. They worried and o ffered tenuous \nsolutions drawn from their understanding and experience. Actors such as \nRodr\u00edguez and the residents of Santa Ana and Santa B\u00e1bara did the best they \ncould in the theater of conscience to speak above the din of\ncodicia and \ninter\u00e9s . They might have succeed in an individual case, but in the long run \nthe stentorian voice of self-interest and economic imperatives carried the day \nin the political imagination \u2013 at least for a time.\nBibliography\nAGNT \u2013 Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n, Tierras (Mexico-City)\nAnon., Romance a M\u00e9xico.

Truth be told, it is always di fficult to conduct any kind of historio-\ngraphical analysis. Now, where the task does not only entail the works of a \ncontemporary author, but the works of an author who is both a signi \ufb01cant \nintellectual reference point and a personal friend of the analyst, the task becomes ever more di fficult. I confess that such is my situation in regard \nto V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui and his works. So, though aware of my limitations, I assume the responsibility I took on when I was invited to participate in this collective work. More speci \ufb01cally, I will attempt to share a critical and com-\nprehensive analysis of what his ideas and contributions imply within the legal historiography of the Indies. Thus, I shall not address the remainder \nof his proli \ufb01co u t p u to fs c i e n t i \ufb01c writing. I would also like to clarify that, \nbesides the fact that I am not in a position to treat all of his contributions \nthoroughly here, I shall not attempt to provide the reader with a catalogue of his fruitful intellectual work. I have a di fferent objective: attempt to outline \nthe central aspects of the historiographical thinking of this renowned Master, \nwhose studies have, for decades, attracted the attention of his colleagues and \nof many others interested in recreating the Spanish American past both in t h eA m e r i c a sa n di nE u r o p e .A sr e g a r d st h ea u t h o ra n dt h er o l et h a th ep l a y s  within this discipline, I believe that the same words that Tau himself dedi-\ncated to Garc\u00eda-Gallo when making an account of his intellectual back-\nground can be rightfully applied to him as well; i. e., that the Argentine legal historian also has an \u201coutstanding pro \ufb01le\u201d , given that he has dra fted various \nworks on method and guidance which have contributed \u201cdecisively to the setting of guidelines within the discipline. \u201d Similarly, it can be truly asserted \nthat, as a researcher, he \u201ccritically welcomed the legacy of previous scholars \nand developed new criteria, most of which received academic consensus\u201d , and that we owe him \u201csharp analyses that covered di fferent theoretical perspec-\ntives, with no opponents of his stature, except for partial disagreements. \u201d\n1\n1TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1993) 9.\nV\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui and the Legal Historiography of the Indies 151It is appropriate to describe V\u00edctor Tau as a legal historian who under-\nstands Law as the expression of a way of seeing the world, that is, a legal \ntradition. This is his natural observatory. Now, it is worth recalling that as a \nmember \u2013 possibly, the most prominent \u2013 of what can be identi \ufb01ed as the \nthird generation of great experts in the history of the Law of the Indies \u2013 the \nsame generation that reviewed and went beyond the guidelines set by the two highest exponents of the \ufb01rst generation, Rafael de Altamira and Ricar-\ndo Levene, and the most renowned of the second generation, such as Garc\u00eda-Gallo, Alamiro de Avila Martel and Ricardo Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa \u2013, V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui has excelled as an intellectual leader for several decades. Cer-tainly, that su ffices to warrant a piece of writing such as this. Nonetheless, \nmy desire to elucidate the guidelines of his legal-historical criteria also \nresponds to another reason and has a very speci \ufb01c goal: helping to cover, \nat least in part, the de\ufb01cit in self-re \ufb02ection that the legal history of the Law of \nthe Indies has. This discipline, despite its relative theoretical weakness, cur-\nrently spurs considerable academic interest, and is continuously and con-stantly nurtured by large amounts of varied monographs.\n2. As for the praise received by the works of V\u00edctor Tau, I understand that \ntheir main impact results from his creativity in the proposal of new topics and the treatment of areas that were le ftbehind by ancient masters and \ncolleagues.\n2Far from intending to make a thorough record of this kind of \ncontributions, I can underline, from among his original concerns and recon-siderations, the detailed analysis of the set of sources of Law; his preoccupa-tion for the local and concrete practice of normativity; his early and clear awareness of the integration of the Law of the Indies into the intellectual \nframework of the European legal tradition. In fact, a key aspect of the legal \nhistorical thinking of Tau has been his \ufb02exible notion of what must be \nconsidered Law of the Indies. In this regard, he has a ffirmed that \u201cagainst \na classical, unitary, rigid image of the Law of the Indies imposed from the Peninsula, there arise new images o f a multiple, unbounded Law of the \nIndies, stemming from the di fferent regions of the New World, in accord-\nance with the diverse geographical and human realities of the vast conti-nent. \u201d\n3\n2 For an example see T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1980) 331 and 332.\n3TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 85.\n152 Ezequiel Ab\u00e1soloH o w e v e r ,Im u s tr e g r e tt h a th i s \ufb01ne style has not always bore fruit as \nexpected. Thus, among what Tau himself described as \u201cuncharted pro \ufb01les\u201d , I \nunderstand that the set of his very subtle and valuable conceptual creations \u2013 \nlike \u201coscillations\u201d4or \u201csatellite-texts\u201d ,5to mention just two of them \u2013 have \nnot yet become an integral part of the consolidated lexical tools that I believe he can still provide to academia. Besides, I must also admit that I personally do not always agree with his opinions. Far from sharing his assertion that \n\u201cthe bans of good government take the most popular place within the legal \nsystem, \u201d\n6I tend to think the opposite.\nApart from the foregoing, it must also be stated that Tau\u2019s work stands \nout, again and again, due to his concern to verify the points of view outlined initially, and because of his honesty at the time of warning on the potential \nweaknesses of the evidence o ffered. Thus, there have been plenty of oppor-\ntunities in which he engages in a dialogue with his readership on the di ffi-\nculties experienced. By way of example, when he presented his works on the \ncustoms of the Indies, and a fter warning that \u201cin successive studies during \nthe last 25 years\u201d he \u201cgradually [noted that the] Law of the Indies increas-\ningly differed from contemporary Law in its conception and structure, \u201d he \ndid not fear to admit that the recreation of American customs demanded of \nhim \u201can arduous task, not always explicitly expressed, not always along safe paths. \u201d\n7\nBesides, while one of his concerns has been to replace the ancient legalist\nfocus of the legal system of the Indies for one based on the notion of legal \ntradition8(a goal derived from the conviction about anachronistic deviations \nimposed by 20th century dogmatism), his historiographical endeavor is also featured by a fascinating intellectual exercise, where the subtle and intelli-\ngent use of the most varied sources\n9coexists with a formidable rigor and \naccuracy in the delimitation of the ob jects of study and the exposition of \nresults.10\n4TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1977) 88.\n5TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (2004) 18.\n6TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (2004) 22.\n7TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (2001) 14.\n8TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 43.\n9TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 88.\n10 Cfr., for example, T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1977) 86.\nV\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui and the Legal Historiography of the Indies 1533. Now, as important as the foregoing may be considered, I do not \ufb01nd \nit the most distinguished of Tau\u2019s contributions. In my opinion, there are \nother more relevant aspects. His propositions have fostered and encouraged \nresearch by others more than once, to a certain extent, because they are courteously open to academic debate, and because they are noted for the formulation of manifold conclusions de \ufb01ned by a provisional factor\n11in-\nherent in the conviction that no scienti \ufb01c research can ever be considered a \n\u201cclose\u201d piece.12\nI would like to point out that several of the distinctive features of Tau\u2019s \nworks are along the lines of those of the most salient exponents of the Law of the Indies traditional scholars, especially in the formulation identi \ufb01ed with \nt h em e m b e r so ft h es oc a l l e d\nSchool of Levene . Among the most important \nfeatures of this line of historiography, it is worth stressing the insistent heuristic concern mentioned above, and the \ufb01rm conviction that a true \nunderstanding of legal phenomena requires the integration of past Law into an ample framework of complex socio-cultural expressions; thus, the con-stant concern of the Argentine Professor to link legal history and social \nhistory.\n13It is precisely based on this conception of the nature of legal phe-\nnomena that Tau a ffirms, among other considerations, that \u201cLaw accepted as \nsuch by the political authority or by jurists has a scope of in \ufb02uence and \napplication that hardly ever reaches all the corners of society. \u201d14Likewise, \nas a consequence of such outlooks, which integrate Law into the social fabric, our author admits: \u201cI would like to draw attention to an approach that \nrecognizes laws as social events and which, a fter establishing laws as one of \nthe mechanisms for the creation of the Law, veri \ufb01es their coherency and \ntension with the other sources, con \ufb01rms the presence of social and political \nforces in their origin and enforcement, notes their unique manners of appli-cation, observes their use and lack of use, unveils social acceptance and resist-ance mechanisms, examines their presence in legal proceedings, notarial records, literature and daily conversation. \u201d Thus, \u201cquestions arise: what is the role played by jurists within this process and to what extent do laws \nsupport the growing strength of state power; do laws re \ufb02ect social aspirations; \n11 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1980) 333.\n12 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 123.\n13 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992b) 4 and 5.\n14 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 24.\n154 Ezequiel Ab\u00e1solodo they propose goals, principles, standards; are all social groups aware of \ntheir provisions, or is this awareness limited to legal experts? These are some \nof the questions that ought to make laws a matter of joint concern by legal \nhistorians and by political, social, economic and cultural experts, among others\u201d , each addressing such questions from their special viewpoint.\n15\nAnother frequent feature of V\u00edct or Tau\u2019s research style is his \ufb01ne selection \nof the materials and the clear examinations to which they are subjected. Our \nauthor has recognized his \u201cinterest in researching into the notion of justice \nof a certain author does not have a mere academic purpose, of intellectual delight, for sheer academic speculation. Without underestimating this aspect, my purpose is to examine the use of this notion in legal practice. And thus verify to what extent scholarly contributions are accepted, appre-\nciate how such notion operates in the arguments of jurists, and observe the \nvalue given to it in the then prevailing mindset. To that end, it is necessary to consider that casuist thinking, which is twisted in itself, requires notions and rules to support the formulation of particular solutions. The absence of strict tenets within the legal system led to the appreciation of certain notions such \nas justice, which has played a key role as a guide, end and limit at the same \ntime. \u201d\n16\n4. Strictly speaking, and although at present he may be the historian studying the Law of the Indies most concerned in de \ufb01ning and specifying \na sound and original conceptual-th eoretical framework, his scienti \ufb01cp r o -\ngram has not always been presented within a neat organic structure, even despite Tau\u2019s manifest tendency on the matter.\n17Therefore, it can be argued \nthat a considerable portion of his thoughts on program and method are \nmore or less scattered through his works. Among the notes that are most \nrepeated within such work, his rigorous analytical attitude is worthy of mention. Thus, far from indulgent and excessive praise, Tau has undertaken to \u201cintroduce the scalpel of criticism\u201d\n18more than once, urging his counter-\nparts to \u201ccome out of the narrow environment where Dogmatism has en-\nclosed the notion of Law, disregarding all spheres of normativity not estab-\n15 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992b) 5 and 6.\n16 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992c) 609.\n17 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 13.\n18 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 8.\nV\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui and the Legal Historiography of the Indies 155lished by the written law of the State. Such a restrictive conception cannot \nbe applied to our Law of the Indies, nor to other legal systems of the time. \u201d19\nTau Anzo\u00e1tegui\u2019s recognized sharpness bene \ufb01ts from the fact that many \nof his thoughts have been enhanced aft er long analysis and the subsequent \nrevision of his lucid initial propositions. That is to say, that his style stands out because of valuable and sustained intellectual endeavors. Such is the case, among many others, of the process that he \ufb01nalized a fter two decades \nwith the publication of his organic work on the bans of good government.\n20\nBased on his disciplined and continual formulation of ideas, perspectives and interests, the works of Tau are de\ufb01ned, more than by \u201csurprises\u201d , by the \npre-announcement of a series of hypotheses which, having undergone cor-rections and adjustments, tend to conclude into \ufb01rm global statements. It \ncan be said that his intuition brings about numerous unique studies, which, eventually, enable him to formulate suggestive and appealing global recre-ations of the legal past. Thus, he explains, for instance, and I believe that with some degree of exaggeration in terms of their randomness, that the works that make up\nLa Ley en Am\u00e9rica hispana [Law in Spanish America] did \nnot respond to \u201ca previous plan, but rather, arose in isolation, fostered by various intellectual concerns and realized through academic commitment. \u201d\n21\nBesides, endowed as he is with an acute sense of appreciation of the value of the different historical evidence, Tau bene \ufb01ts from the smallest traces off ered \nb yt h ew i d es e to fd o c u m e n t st h a th eh a sg a t h e r e di nh i sm u l t i p l ea n d  \nfruitful incursions into archives.\n5. I understand that the key of his thoroughness resides, above all, in the \nexercise of a constant and considered preoccupation, especially the \ufb01rm \npreoccupation with conceptualizing th e legal-historical processes of the \nIndies. Of course, Tau can thus only reject simplifying schemes,\n22even those \nendorsed by the best-established tradition in the discipline. Hence, for exam-ple, his concern to disentangle the normativity of the Indies led him to overcome the once-respected, distorted and retrospective legalism to con-\ntend that the Law of Spanish America was integrated into an order in which \n19 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 22.\n20 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2004) 15.\n21 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992b) 18 and 19.\n22 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992b) 12.\n156 Ezequiel Ab\u00e1solocustom had a prominent role,23and to extol the virtues of legal scholars in \nt h e i rr o l ea s\u201c d i r e c t i v es o u r c e \u201dw i t h i nt h eS p a n i s hA m e r i c a nl e g a lc u l t u r e .24\nI nt h es a m es e n s e ,h eh a ss t r e s s e dt h a tw h i l e\u201c t h er e j e c t i o no fd o w n g r a d i n g  \nthe Law of the Indies to the Recompilaci\u00f3n [Compilation] or to peninsular \nlegislation has frequently been noted by ancient and modern masters of our discipline, \u201d such criterion has not always been applied, \u201cat times, even by themselves. \u201d\n25\nAll in all, Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui\u2019s works and activity stand out for a ubiquitous \nand considered preoccupation with the activity of legal historians, and the need to \u201cencourage the renewal and expansion of the content of our disci-pline. \u201d\n26Consistent with his condemnation of any kind of \u201cimplied\u201d histor-\niographical theory,27more than once Tau has made the e ffort to introduce \n\u201c a m o n gu s ,i na no r g a n i cf a s h i o n ,a n dw ith a view to methodological debate \nand gradual acceptance\u201d , several thoughts on the appropriate approach to understanding the Law of the Indies. Against this backdrop, he has noted that \u201creview is a claim common to all disciplines and times, but in certain opportunities, it is a pressing issue, \u201d and he has endorsed setting out precise \n\u201cgeneral guidelines\u201d which will allow \u201c \ufb01xing new [disciplinary] scopes with \nfurther clarity. \u201d\n28\nTo a certain extent, Tau\u2019s rigorous theoretical preoccupation bene \ufb01ts from \nhis frequent \u2013 and intelligent \u2013 readings of the best legal historiography. \nNonetheless, the latter was impossible on several occasions, such as when he \ndecided to address topics lacking an adequate monograph base.\nTau himself has described his style in Casuismo y Sistema [Casuistry and \nSystem]: \u201cat the outset and during the course of this research \u2013 he comments \n\u2013 I have borne in mind the ideas put forward and the possibility of their multiple usefulness. That has decisively encouraged me to put them into \naction. For a long time, I have gathered the material that I use as support, and in the last years I have intensi \ufb01ed searches, chie\ufb02 yi nS p a n i s hl i b r a r i e s  \nand archives.

There are \nno thematic indexes or \ufb01les that facilitate the search. Though I have always \npursued to select writings or examples that are representative and su fficient \nto minimize an error in judgment, this does not prevent other testimonies or new interpretations of known texts from taking to standpoints that may soften or directly contradict the opinions I state. Far from exhausted, the \nresearch I present remains open to new searches and re \ufb02ections. \u201d\n29\nCertainly, the extraordinary academic dissemination enjoyed by Tau\u2019s \nworks is connected to the most distinguished historiographical tradition of the Law of the Indies. However, there is evidence of an unbiased and critical perspective, which has encouraged him, more than once, to over-come ancient disciplinary paradigms \u2026\nIn Tau\u2019s view, previous historiographical products make up an important \ndisciplinary intellectual capital. Nonetheless, that does not prevent him from suggesting the careful employment of accepted paradigms, and of what he considers model investigations.\n30In this regard, Tau says, generically, that \n\u201cour studies, in continuous formation, have a gradual progress \u2013 not linear \nor conformist \u2013 through the contributio ns of successive generations. Thus, \nwhen we look back to the past of our discipline, we do much more than an \nact of evocation; instead, we engage in a necessary exercise of introspective knowledge of our activities, both cumulative and critical, which eventually leads us to consolidate the current foundations of our work. \u201d\n31Hence, there \nis an imperative need to foster new approaches to the discipline, especially after noting the persistence of stagnant legalist views,\n32and the inappropri-\nate \u201capplication of the set of sources of Law in the formulation of mono-graphs of the Indies. \u201d\n33\nBased on the preceding arguments, I believe that in the future, to a good \nextent, the works of Tau shall bear the responsibility to ful \ufb01ll a prediction \nanalogous to the one conveyed by Altamira to Levene in their time: \u201cIt is possible to believe that in some years colonial history will di ffer radically \nfrom what has been revealed up to the present time\u201d .\n34\n29 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992a) 14.\n30 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 121.\n31 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1990) 475.\n32 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 41.\n33 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 47.\n34 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1990) 483.\n158 Ezequiel Ab\u00e1soloBibliography\nTauAnzo\u00e1tegui,V \u00edctor (1977), El abogado del Cabildo de Buenos Aires durante el \nvirreinato, en: Academia Nacional de la Historia, Bicentenario del Virreinato \ndel R\u00edo de la Plata, Buenos Aires, t. 1, 85\u2013104\nTauAnzo\u00e1tegui ,V\u00edctor (1980), Consideraciones sobre la aplicaci\u00f3n de la Recopila-\nci\u00f3n de 1680, en: Revista de Historia del Derecho 8, 331\u2013395\nTauAnzo\u00e1tegui ,V\u00edctor (1990), Altamira y Levene: una amistad y un paralelismo \nintelectual, en: Cuadernos del Instituto de Investigaciones J ur\u00eddicas (M\u00e9xico) \n15, 475\u2013492\nTauAnzo\u00e1tegui ,V\u00edctor (1992a), Casuismo y sistema.

The right to memory and lost identities\nOn December 15, 2010, the United States recognized the Universal Declara-\ntion of Indigenous Populations . Their recognition followed the one of Canada, \nAustralia and New Zealand thereby reinforcing the hopes of those who \nconsidered the Declaration to be an important instrument for the defense of indigenous populations and the reparation of the wounds in \ufb02icted on \nthem by history.\n1It is common knowledge that the Declaration was approved \nby the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2007 with the unfavorable \nvote of the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the absten-\ntion of 11 countries. It was not easy to obtain the approbation of all mem-bers because of the resistance of many states to recognize the native popu-lations who lived in their own territories as nations holding collective rights.\n2As a matter of fact, already in 1982 a special working group com-\nposed of representatives of the indig enous populations was formed at the \nSub-commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and the Protection of Minorities. In 1993 the\nWorking Group on Indigenous Populations prepared \nand presented to the Sub-commission an initial project that was approved \none year later.3It seemed that everything was going well but a fter the \n1 The Announcement of the United State\u2019s support for the United Nations Declaration \non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was given by President Obama during the Tribal \nNations Consultation in Washington, D.

N. Economic \nand Social Council, and it is part of the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrim-ination and Protection of Minorities. The Project was approved by the Sub-Commission \nwith the Resolution 1994/45 (26/8/1994). With the same resolution the Sub-Commission \nh a da l s os u b m i t t e dt h ed r a ftto the U.N.

The individuali-zation of a new legal subjectivity, the indigenous people, a collective subject whose full right to self-determination is recognized, is possible only by recognizing their right to manifest, practice, teach their cultural traditions, \ncelebrate their spiritual and religious ceremonies, pass on their history, their \nculture and their language to future generations. In the text there is no de\ufb01nition of indigenous people. This should not astonish us since it was \nnot contained in the project of 1993. In fact it was not necessary. This new s u b j e c td i dn o tn e e da n yd e \ufb01nition because it did not ask for state recog-\nnition or legitimation. It is not necessary because it is already given, it is a historical subject that existed before the states. But it claims, precisely through the use of memory, the preservation and reinforcement of its polit-ical, social and legal system.\n5\ndraftwas adopted by the Human Rights Council but the U.N. General Assembly adopted \nthe Declaration only on September 13, 2007 (Resolution 64/295) with 143 votes in favor, \n4 against it (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United States) and 11 abstentions. The pro-\ntection of the indigenous identity is a right already recognized in 1989 by the ILO Con-\nvention 169 (Convention Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent \nCountries). It was the \ufb01rst treaty concerning the protection of indigenous rights adopted \nby the International Labor Organization and rati \ufb01ed by 27 states.\n4S e e N uzzo (2002); N uzzo (2011).\n5 In 1983 Martinez Cobo, special rapporteur of the U.N. Sub-Commission on the Prevention \nof Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, Study of the Problem of Discrimination against Indigenous Populations, U.N. Doc. E/ CN.4/Sub.2/1983/21 Add.1\u20137 (1983) wrote \nthat the community, the people and the indigenous nations are those who \u201chaving a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre\u2013colonial societies that developed on their \nterritories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of societies now prevailing in \nthose territories or parts of them. They form at present non dominant sectors of society and they are determined to preserve and develop and transmit to the future generations \ntheir ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis for their continued exis-\ntence as people. \u201d\n162 Luigi NuzzoIn order to exist again as a people it is necessary to be able to remember. \nBut remembering is not memory. It is part of the distinction with which \nmemory works. The other issue is forgetting. As a matter of fact memory is \nbased on a series of selective operations of remembering and forgetting. As Raffaele De Giorgi wrote, the memory is the unity of the distinction \nbetween remembering and forgetting.\n6\nRemembering and forgetting are the distinctions through which memory \nw o r k sa n da tt h es a m et i m ew ec o u l ds a y ,w i t hac e r t a i ns i m p l i \ufb01cation, they \nare the two poles around which both the issue of indigenous peoples\u2019 claim for identity and the discourse of colonialism have been structured and from which, in the course of time and in di fferent ways, strategies of assertion or \ndenial of indigenous subjectivity have been developed. In other words, out-\nside of memory, remembering and forgetting become the conditions that \nmake the existence of an indigenous legal subject possible or impossible. Only memory of oneself and of one\u2019s own history can produce identity and thus subjectivity. On the contrary, those who lack memory or those whose memory was stolen or overwritten do not exist. Franz Fanon reminded this \nvery effectively many years ago opening a meeting on the relationship \nbetween national culture and \ufb01ghts for freedom. According to Fanon the \ncolonial dominion had produced a \u201ccultural obliteration. \u201d In other words it \nd i s c o n n e c t e dt h es u b j e c t e dp e o p l e sf r o mt h e i rc u l t u r ed e n y i n gt h el o c a l  reality, introducing new juridical relationships and producing their system-\natized subjection.\n7The consequences were dramatic. The consciousness of \nthe impossibility of becoming white or of eliminating the \u201chated negritude\u201d \nled to wrong-footing of the colonial ego , to the irreparable schizophrenia of \nidentity. Many years later in the post-colonial debate the uncertainties about \nidentity became a foundation of power.8The reconstruction of one\u2019s past \nthrough a long and painful process of re-memorization on the one hand \ncon\ufb01rmed the impossibility of rejoining one\u2019s original identity; on the other \nhand it was a tool for imagining a new hybridized subjectivity in which the identity of the colonized and of the colonizer melted. Thus it became impos-\ns i b l et oo v e r c o m et h ec o n \ufb02ict between the \u201ccolonial self and the colonized \nother\u201d and at the same time to establish both the mutual dependence of the \n6D eGiorgi (2004) 142\u201361.\n7Fanon (1971) 61.\n8 Fanon\u2019s central position in post-colonial studies is declared by C hakrabarty (2000) 17.\nBetween America and Europe 163two once opposing identities and their continuous \ufb02uidity. Paradoxically \nsubaltern studies revealed the deepest violence of global capitalism exactly \nat the moment when its strategies con\ufb01rmed the uniqueness of the world \nand gave a peaceful representation of it, based on the dialectic relationship \nbetween opposite concepts of center and periphery. They built a theory of subalternity that, starting from Gramsci\u2019s concept of hegemony, overtook the binary logic of \ufb01rst world / third world, colonizer / colonized and passed \nfrom the dialectic self / other to the dissemination of the images of the self and of other. The result was a new subjectivity, precisely a hybridized one, residing in the body of a new protagonist upon which colonial modernity had built its reasoning and that asked to be the maker of its own history.\n9\nThe political battle for the recognition of one\u2019s own diversity and one\u2019s \nown right to memory imposed therefore new approaches to historiography. \nThis last one entrusted with the task of revealing the inadequacy of legal and political categories of Western thought in order to favour the comprehen-sion of the world\u2019s complexity, and the relationships of power pre-existing its use, thus determining the selection of facts to be told and the way in which \nthey had to be narrated.\n10A tt h es a m et i m et h em e t h o d o l o g i c a lr e n e w a l  \nproduced by decentralized forces comin g from post-colonial and subaltern \nstudies overcame the special and theoretic limits of the previous historiog-\nraphy and allowed us to make more complex narrative canons of Western historiography and the discursive practices of international lawyers.\n11\nHowever, there is a still a lot to be done, as the strange case of the derecho \nindiano seems to con \ufb01rm.\n2.

We might say that Spanish Colonial Law is the \npolitically correct version of a legal discipline that is well-founded in the \nHispanic academic tradition: the derecho indiano .\nAnyhow, it is not easy to provide a de \ufb01nition. It seems easier to say what \nthederecho indiano was not: it was not an indigenous law. Carlos Petit \nmaliciously de \ufb01ned it as the exotic version of ius commune , and Bartolom\u00e9 \nClavero, more polemically, a \u201cderecho generado o reconocido por parte de Europa para dicha geograf\u00eda y dicha humanidad, como si \u00e9sta careciera de \ncultura y as\u00ed de capacidad para regirse por s\u00ed misma, as\u00ed como para determi-nar la reglas de recepci\u00f3n y acomodamiento de la gente sobrevenida y extra-\u00f1a de entrada para ella. \u201d\n12In any case it was a European law that on one \nhand the legal historiography imagined to have arrived in America with the \n\ufb01rstconquistadores , on the other hand it was used to tell the story of the West \nIndies in the same way as the legal history of European countries had been \ntold.\nMoreover, the expression derecho indiano itself was the result of an inven-\ntion. It was absolutely unknown to the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries\u2019 jurists \nwho used the expression derecho de las indias orde los Reynos de Indias .O nt h e  \ncontrary it was invented by the Argentinean Riccardo Levene, leading schol-\nar of the Argentinean school of legal historians, and founding father of the discipline together with the Spanish in exile Rafael Altamira.\n13According to \nLevene the derecho indiano had to be identi \ufb01ed with all the law in force in \nthe West Indies. It was an extremely rich prescriptive set of provisions of a different origin and nature that met in a single system able to \u201corganizar el \ngobierno espiritual y temporal de las indias, establecer la condici\u00f3n de sus habitantes, regular la navegaci\u00f3n y el comercio y sobre todo convertir a los \nindig\u00e9nas a la f\u00e9 cat\u00f3lica. \u201d\n14\nBut the loyalty to the idea of system and the sharing of the aims that \nthederecho indiano would bring about did not prevent the historiographic \nrepresentations o ffered by the doctrine from being univocal. Simply put, one \nmight say that until the end of the 1970s (or rather until Alfonso Garc\u00eda Gallo\u2019s positivistic approach undisputedly prevailed) the system of\nderecho \n12 P etit (1993a) 665; C lavero (2004\u20132005) 543.\n13 On the relationship between Rafael Altamira and Ricardo Levene, see T auAnzo\u00e1tegui\n(1997a).\n14 Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa, cited in T auAnzo\u00e1tegu (1997b) 33 ( ft.1 9 ) .\nBetween America and Europe 165indiano was based on the supremacy of Castilian legislation and on a certain \nimage of the Spanish monarchy in which from the outset the signs of a \nmodern state were there to be seen. Then, with the end of Francoism, the \nfading of Garc\u00eda Gallo\u2019s star and Spain\u2019s entrance into Europe it was also possible to rediscover the legal and customary elements of the medieval legal experience. At the same time Spanish legal history started to be included in the history of\nius commune and the common European juridical tradition.15\nI will begin with Garc\u00eda Gallo. The legal history in Spanish speaking \ncountries is characterized by his activity on the Iberian Peninsula as well as in Latin America and by his extremely rich scienti \ufb01cc o n t r i b u t i o n .\n16He \nwas able to make himself responsible for Edoardo de Hinojosa y Naveros\u2019 heritage, mythicizing his \ufb01g u r e ,a c t i n ga sh i sp u p i la n da tt h es a m et i m e  \nmethodologically criticizing his work and his school. He took upon himself the burden of projecting a new history of law, thinking of it in the \ufb01rst place \nas a legal-scienti \ufb01c discipline, in which the legal historian is both a jurist and \nas c i e n t i s t .T h e \ufb01r s ti m a g e so ft h i sr e n e w e dh i s t o r yo fS p a n i s hl a wa sa  \njuridical science were collected in two works published between 1948 and \n1952 dedicated to Hinojosa. The \ufb01rst one introduced a complete re-edition \no ft h el a t t e r \u2019 sw o r ka n dt h eo t h e rw a st h er e s u l to fac o n f e r e n c eh e l da tt h e  \nInstituto nacional de estudios jur\u00eddicos , and the following year published in the \nAnuario de historia del derecho espa\u00f1ol .17\nThe methodological change that Garc\u00eda Gallo called for was not simple: \nhe had to introduce Edoardo de Hinojosa y Naveros\u2019 work, commemorate \nthe hundredth anniversary of his birth and at the same time trace out the guide-lines of his own history of law. He had to impose a turning point in Spanish legal historiography through a deep renewal of the conceptual \ni n s t r u m e n t si tu s e d .A tt h es a m et i m eh eh a dt oh i d et h ec h a n g e si nh i s  \nown point of view inside a discourse and a representation that, both on a political and legal level, focused on continuities more than fractures.\n18\n15 N uzzo (2008).\n16 On Garc\u00eda Gallo\u2019s role at the Instituto internacional de Historia del Derecho Indiano founded \nin Buenos Aires in 1966 with Ricardo Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa and Alamiro de Avila Martel, see \nMartir\u00e9 (1996).\n17 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1948); G arc\u00eda Gallo (1953b); a critical analysis of the relationship be-\ntween Garc\u00eda Gallo and Hinojosa in V allejo (1998).\n18 These fractures were evident in G arc\u00eda Gallo (1941), where he criticized Hinojosa\u2019s \nthesis on the Germanic component of Spanish law expressed in H inojosa (1910).\n166 Luigi NuzzoThe history of law was a legal science that needed its own methodology in \norder to be told. This on the one hand would free legal scholarship from \npolitical constraints, and from the economic and more generally the socio-\ncultural context. On the other hand it would prevent singling the jurist out as the main partner of the legal historian. Moreover, the legal historian was also a jurist and as such felt the duty to remove his subject, the law, from the in\ufb02uence of other disciplines and in particular freeing it from cultural con-\ntaminations that would alter its identity and it is precisely identity the issue.\nWhilst reconstructing the route through which the legal systems and the \ninstitutions had developed, Garc\u00eda Gallo did not speak of medieval law, but rather of a present law that regulated the daily aspects of social life. Thus he entrusted the historian with the delicate task of remembering and selecting \nwhich were the element for constructing the memory and identity of the \njurist and the country and what, once again, was to be condemned to oblivion.\nThe problems the legal historian had to face with dealing with the issue of \nderecho indiano were not di fferent. Also in this case the re-de\ufb01nition of \ndisciplinary identity continued to be his main aim. Moreover, while in Spain Garc\u00eda Gallo had identi \ufb01ed Hinojosa as the founder of the discipline, thus \ncontributing to mythicize his pro \ufb01le and presenting himself as his heir, in \nCentral and South America the absence (from his point of view, obviously) of a school which complied with a strict legal method, took him to propose \nhimself as the true founder of the\nderecho indiano .19\nAt the beginning of the 1950s Garc\u00eda Gallo adjusted his strategy. He \nexalted the role of law as a legal source in the 16th century Indies and \nsubjected the methodologies used by the legal historians when studying \nthederecho indiano to severe criticism.20Even if he recognized Rafael Alta-\nmira\u2019s and Ricardo Levene\u2019s centrali ty and their importance for the disci-\npline, the approach of the two scholars, with their openness towards history, \n19 See T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992b); about Garc\u00eda Gallo\u2019s begi nning as an Americanist historian \nsee the critical analysis of C lavero (2007).\n20 The articles are: La ley como fuente del derecho en Indias en el siglo XVI (1951); Panorama \nactual de los estudios de historia del derecho indiano (1952), and El desarollo de la historiograf\u00eda \njur\u00eddica indiana (1953), all published in G arc\u00eda Gallo (1972a). In the following years he \noften turned to treating methodological problems rea ffirming the already expressed theses \nor re \ufb01ning his positions. Particularly useful: G arc\u00eda Gallo (1967); G arc\u00eda Gallo (1971); \nGarc\u00eda Gallo (1972b).\nBetween America and Europe 167sociology and politics, had inexorably jeopardized the subject of their stud-\nies. According to Garc\u00eda Gallo they lacked legal sense, the recognition of the \ncentrality of the legal dimension and the will to study it \u201ccon esp\u00edritu y \nt \u00e9 c n i c ad ej u r i s t a s . \u201d21\u201cLa vocaci\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica o sociol\u00f3gica de la mayor parte \nde los cultivadores estudiosos de la Historia del derecho indiano les lleva a atender a los fen\u00f3menos sociales con olvido de los propiamente jur\u00eddicos y a no valorar estos en su propio alcance sino con criterio extra\u00f1o al derecho. La \nconstrucci\u00f3n dogm \u00e1tica, que constituye la tarea principal de los juristas \ncient\u00ed \ufb01cos \u2013 se ocupen del derecho romano, medieval o del actual \u2013 apenas \nse ha intentado.

La Historia del Derecho debe ser para el \njurista un modo de conocer el Derecho, y no la Historia o la sociolog\u00eda. Por ello ha de estudiarse con orientaci\u00f3n, esp\u00edritu y t\u00e9cnica jur\u00eddica. \u201d\n22\nAn historian of derecho indiano has therefore to engage in the discovery of \nhis identity as well as the one of his discipline and contribute to build a national conscience by reconstructing the history of its \u201cnational positive \nlaw. \u201d Also, since the law had its identity, it was necessary to read it being \naware of its evolution, forgetting the historical and social concern and limit-ing the attention to political, social and economic aspects.\n23Consequently \nthe history of the derecho indiano (too long entrusted to historians, at the \nexpense of jurists\u2019 attention) also had to be considered as a scienti \ufb01cd i s c i -\np l i n es i n c et h el a w ,b e i n gas u b j e c tm o r et h a nas i m p l et e c h n i q u e ,w a sat r u e  \n21 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1967) 112. But already in G arc\u00eda Gallo (1948) CX he reiterated Altami-\nra\u2019s \u201csociological concern\u201d that \u201crelegated law to a secondary level\u201d and that \u201che was no \nresearcher of Hinojasa\u2019s kind. \u201d To this point V allejo (1998) 778 writes \u201cUn investigador \nd e lt i p od eH i n o j o s ad eG a r c \u00ed aG a l l oe sl oq u eA l t a m i r ac l a r a m e n t en oe r a .N oe sq u e  relegase Altamira lo jur\u00eddico a un segundo plano, sino que defend\u00eda una posici\u00f3n meto-dol\u00f3gica que entend\u00eda que hacer la historia del derecho implicaba bastante m \u00e1sq u eh a c e r  \nla historia, estrictamente del Derecho; y no se trataba entonces de hacer sociolog\u00eda, sino de seguir haciendo historia del Derecho sin perder de vista sus manifestaciones y condicio-\nnantes m \u00e1s diversos. \u201d\n22 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1952) 55 ff.H ec o n \ufb01rmed these positions nineteen years later: G arc\u00eda  \nGallo (1967) 112.\n23 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1967) 107\u2013119. The quoted paragraph is taken from G arc\u00eda Gallo\n(1972b) 1078.

Lawfulness, being a neutral and evaluating knowledge capable of \ntranslating general values into laws and juridical concepts, was based on the \ndistance which separated it from the violent world of politics and socio-\neconomic struggles, and its capacity to b uild and represent itself as a unique, \nclosed and self-referential system, capable of recognizing its own trueness. The\nderecho indiano was therefore essentially a legislative system.24\nIn a territorial organism that, just as it happened in 16th century in \nFrance, assumed the form of a state where the main theologians, jurists and political thinkers took an active part in the process of absolutistic and bureaucratic centralization, the law seemed the most apt instrument for the realization of the sovereign\u2019s will. It also enabled the renewal of the sover-eign\u2019 s centrality and it was at the same time the clearest instrument of \ncivilization.\n25Thus, on the one hand the positivistic tension and the state \naspirations introduced a functional legal paradigm to read, from a unitary \npoint of view, any discourse on power and on political subjects as well as those not institutionally active in the Indies.\nOn the other hand the legalistic dimension in which the\nConquista was \nabsorbed allowed historiography to intr o d u c eab r e a kb e t w e e nt h ed e s i r e so f  the monarchy for the defense of the rights of the natives and its constant insistence on their evangelization and the violent reality for the Indian population. The laws of Burgos and Valladolid, the\nLeyes Nuevas ,t h e Orde-\nnanzas of 1573 (to give only the most renowned examples) translated the \nreligious concerns of the sovereigns, re \ufb02ected Ferdinando and Isabella\u2019s \npromises to Alessandro VI and initiated a virtuous network between three poles: the imperial chanceries and the jurists of the Crown, the universities and the theologians of Salamanca, the Indian territories and indigenous \n24 In the Indies the concept of law, a fter being initially identi \ufb01ed with the norms in force in \nthe Reign of Castile and automatically bestowed overseas, in the years immediately a fter \nthe Conquista absorbed both the ordenanzas ,l ecedolas ,l ereales provisiones ,l einstrucciones\nand the cartas issued with a general character for all overseas countries, those addressed to \nap r o v i n c ea sw e l la st oac e r t a i np l a c e .I nb o t h cases, for Garc\u00eda Gallo the Indian provi-\nsions were a special law put on top of a hierarchic scale of sources that could be integrated \nin a unique system by a subsidiary Castilian law, de \ufb01ned general or common. Garc\u00eda  \nGallo (1951); G arc\u00eda Gallo (1967); on this issue see T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992d).\n25 P ietschmann (1980).

Christian yearnings, political reasoning and juridical logic com-\npeted in the de \ufb01nition of their status allowing Morales Padr\u00f3n to see in the \nBurgos laws \u201cel primer cuerpo b \u00e1sico del estatuto indigena\u201d and Garc\u00eda Gallo \nto justify up until the 1970s the co-existence, in this fundamental prescrip-tive body, of the recognition of human nature and freedom of the indige-nous population while maintaining the system (of exploitation) of the\nenco-\nmienda .26\n3. Claiming an identity: Francesco Calasso and the system of\nius commune\nT h ec o n s t r u c t i o no fan a t i o n a ll e g a li d e n t i t ya n dt h ep r o j e c to fam e t h o d o -\nlogical renewal of the history of law followed by Garc\u00eda Gallo demanded the \nrecovery and the exaltation of the institutional pro \ufb01l e sa sw e l la st h el e g i s -\nlative activity carried out by the sovereigns of Castile. Yet in order to achieve these objectives it was necessary to undertake a deep change in the mindset in the way the role performed by Roman law in Spain and its heritage was \nperceived.\nSpain, under the dictator Franco, imposed a proudly di fferent (legal) \nhistory from the European one. It was a Christian and nationalistic history \nfocused on the primacy of legislation and of state; a history where the juridical literature had a secondary role and where only an echo of the\nius \ncommune could be heard. Through the ley de las sietes partidas ,t h eg r e a t  \ndrawing up of Alfonso X in 1265, the Romanist and canonistic tradition had also entered the reign of Castile and from there the West Indies. But as a consequence of a precise political strategy aimed at the territorial uni \ufb01cation, \nit had become a common law with national character\nIn Spain, as Garc\u00eda Gallo maintained in a conference held in Rome in the \nmiddle of the 1950s and published in the\nRevista de studios politicos ,t h e ius \ncommune for the \ufb01rst time passed through a crisis highlighting its incapacity \nto offer appropriate answers to the new needs.The American experience then \npitilessly revealed its inadequacy.27Its principles, he continued, were used to \n26 M orales Padr\u00f3n (1979) 308\u2013310; G arc\u00eda Gallo (1977) 755\u2013756.\n27 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1955). The Revista de estudios politicos , at which Garc\u00eda Gallo during the \n1940s collaborated assiduously, was the organ of the Instituto de Estudios Politicos ,t h e  \nideological laboratory of the regime, founded in 1939 following the model of the Istituto \nitaliano di cultura .\n170 Luigi Nuzzoincorporate the Indies into the Crown of Castile and to de \ufb01ne the juridical \ntitles which legitimized the dominions. But when the ius commune reached \nthe Indian coasts, through the Requerimiento , its weakness became evident \nand the scornful answer of two Cen\u00fa caciques was enough to cause the whole \nsystem to be debated.28\nAs Fernand\u00e9z de Oviedo remarked, a fter reading the document, the two \nCaciques denied the validity of Alexander VI\u2019s donation and consequently \nthe legitimacy of the dominion claimed by the Spanish sovereigns and con-\n\ufb01rmed their inalienable rights on those territories. Garc\u00eda Gallo imagined them and represented them to us as \u201c \ufb01rmes en sus convicciones jur\u00eddicas\u201d \na n dc o n s i d e r e dt h e i ra n s w e r\u201c c o n s c i e n t e y concluyente: la validez del dere-\ncho com\u00fan fue rechazada y a \u00e9l opuso el propio derecho ind\u00edgena. \u201d The \nconsequences of this gesture were enormous. \u201cPor primera vez se negaba \nal derecho com\u00fan su vigencia universal y se le rechazaba en la resoluci\u00f3n de los problemas del Nuevo Mundo. \u201d\n29\nIn the damp forests of Cen\u00fa and for an audience, as the Italian one, with \nlittle familiarity with the Indies, Garc\u00eda Gallo put an inglorious end to a \nuniversal juridical knowledge, heavy with triumphs in Europe, and at the \nsame time stressed that the insu fficiencies of ius commune h a da l s oc a u s e da  \nbene \ufb01cial \u201cSpanish reaction. \u201d And this time the answers were both adequate \nand immediate. On a doctrinal level Francisco de Vitoria had substituted the \nius commune with the \u201csystem\u201d of ius gentium and on a legislative level the \nCrown had issued important legislation inspired by systematic tensions and the Christian dimension of the old\nius commune which had recognized the \nprinciples of freedom and independence of the autochthonous populations.\nI am not sure whether Francesco Calasso, the legal historian of \u201cLa \nSapienza University\u201d , had also been invited to the meeting at the Spanish Institute of Rome that day and, if he had been sitting among the audience, what he might have thought about the sad destiny Garc\u00eda Gallo reserved to \nius commune or about his legislative approach to legal history. Garc\u00eda Gallo\u2019s \n28 The Requerimiento too had a state character. In fact G arc\u00eda Gallo (1955) 157 writes that \n\u201ceste Requerimiento, pleno de amenazas a quien lo aceptase, tampoco era distinto del que \ncualquier Gobierno actual, antes de emplezar la fuerza, hace a cualquier grupo de sedicio-sos para que acaten el poder establecido\u201d; on the discursive strategies of the\nRequerimiento\nsee N uzzo (2004) 13\u201385.\n29 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1955) 158.\nBetween America and Europe 171discourse (particularly his attention towards national identity and the exten-\nsive use of the term system) enabled us to reconstruct the threads that \nconnected the Spanish professor to the Italian legal culture and particularly \nthe in\ufb02 uence exercised by his system of ius commune .E v e ni ft h eG a r c \u00ed a  \nGallo\u2019s project of methodological re newal had imposed the re-evaluation \nof the role played by ius commune or presupposed its complete nationaliza-\ntion, it still needed the idea of a system introduced, by Calasso to endow the \nmedieval juridical experience with a scienti \ufb01c character and to connect ius \ncommune and iura propria .\nCertainly the di fferences were not negligible. Garc\u00eda Gallo\u2019s theoretical \nconstruction, simply based on the binomial law and nation, was far from the \nre\ufb01ned doctrine of Calasso. Moreover, both shared the objective of rede \ufb01n-\ning the identity of the discipline and using legal history as an instrument for the construction of a national juridical identity. Calasso\u2019s historiographic proposal required the recovery of the historical authenticity of medieval law and the reconstruction of the economic, political and social relation-ships in which the juridical texts and their authors were immersed. It was no \nlonger the time for a \u201chistory of Roman law during Middle Age\u201d as Savigny \nhad done, for old contrapositions between Romanists and Germanists (or Italianists) nor for sterile exercises of dogmatic reconstruction. As a matter of fact, in the Middle Ages \u201ca new spirit\u201d had already taken possession of the old body of Roman law, and put new energies into it and determined a deep \ntransformation unifying that law with \u201cits own experience\u201d , its needs and \n\u201crivivendolo ed esaltandolo come norma del proprio operare\u201c .\n30Roman law \nwas no longer the hard core of the medieva l juridical experience, but rather \ntheius commune and the historian of Italian law was its authorized cantor. It \nwas not only a problem of discipline or an academic struggle aimed at achieving more room for the history of Italian law inside the law faculties. Examining the historicity of\nius commune meant considering the existence of \nan Italian law free from the Italian state and recognizing an Italian juridical identity before the national uni \ufb01cation.\n31\nFollowing Santi Romano\u2019s institutionalist theory, Calasso identi \ufb01ed law \nwith the legal system and sustained its plurality. \u201cLa constatazione della pluralit\u00e0, per\u00f2, come ha scritto Pietro Costa, non era per Calasso la conclu-\n30 C alasso (1954) 33; C alasso (1939); see C onte (2009) 27\u201332.\n31 I glesia Ferreir\u00f3s (2000).\n172 Luigi Nuzzos i o n ed e l l \u2019 i n d a g i n e ,m al as u ap r e m e s s a ;s e r v i v aap o r r ec o r r e t t a m e n t eu n  \nproblema, che per Calasso \u00e8 ilproblema rispetto al quale le considerazioni \n\u2018istituzionalistiche\u2019 sono strumentali: questo problema \u00e8 il problema del-l\u2019unit\u00e0. \u201d\n32As a matter of fact, according to Calasso, the construction of a \nnational legal history required the reassembling of a plurality of norms inside a unitary system. The\nius commune united the histories in one great \nItalian history seeming to be a system of systems. At the same time Croce\u2019s \nidealism and Romano\u2019s theory itself did not allow Calasso to break free from \nthe images of state and law and led him to consider the system of ius \ncommune as a legislative system, or at least to consider the legislative com-\nponent as the prevalent one.33The history of ius commune was now the \n\u201cstoria di questo sistema unitario, e non soltanto del diritto romano \ncomune, e meno ancora della scienza del diritto o della giurisprudenza. \nCh\u00e8 infatti, scienza e giurisprudenza furono l\u2019organo potentissimo della evoluzione del sistema: ma essendo questo un sistema legislativo, la posi-zione dommatica dell\u2019attivit\u00e0 del giurista o del giudice vi rimase sempre ed esclusivamente quella di attivit\u00e0 interpretativa, sul fondamento logico e \ngiuridico, e quindi con tutte le norme e i limiti che ogni attivit\u00e0 interpre-\ntativa pu\u00f2 avere in un sistema legislativo. \u201d\n34\nThus Calasso understood the historicity of medieval law and stressed its \nspeci \ufb01city with regards the Roman law opposing at \ufb01rst the dogmatic \napproaches of Pandectistic school and then the neo-pandettistic revival of \nthe 1950s. Moreover, in order to transform that \u201cnew\u201d law into a scienti \ufb01c \nknowledge and into an instrument to legitimate a discipline in search of \nredemption inside the European academy, he needed to recover Savigny\u2019s notion of system. Furthermore, Calasso could not but use the system. Inde-\npendently from its legislative and doctrinal connotation it was not identi \ufb01ed \nwith a logical principle necessary for the exposition and the organization of \nthe subject matters, or with a historic product functional for a precise polit-ical juridical project. On the contrary, it was on one hand a constitutive p r i n c i p l eo fl a wa n di tw a si m p o s s i b l et os e ti ta s i d ew i t h o u tl o s i n gt h e  \nscienti\ufb01c nature and the truth of one\u2019s own discourse and of one\u2019s own \n32 C osta (1999). P aradisi (1980) remains fundamental.\n33 P aradisi (1980) 217 ff.\n34 C alasso (1939) 129; see also C alasso (1948). C osta (1999) 38 uses the above quoted \nparagraph.\nBetween America and Europe 173subject; on the other hand, it was an interpretative model good for selecting \nthe heterogeneous prescriptive materials that it should be able to coordinate \nand build upon the reality it was to describe.35\nIn 1951 \u2013 the same year when some fundamental works that Calasso had \ndedicated in the 1930s to the problem of ius commune were collected in \na well-known volume called Introduzione al diritto commune \u2013a ne s s a yb y  \nGarc\u00eda Gallo on the concept of law and its role inside the system of sources in 16th century Indies appeared. The Spanish scholar did not miss the Italian \neditorial novelty quoting it and recommending it to his pupils as a funda-mental lecture.\n36He needed those pages for the construction of a unitary \nand scienti \ufb01c concept of derecho indiano .T h e yg a v eh i mt h ec o n c e p t u a l  \nframework to keep the old Castilian law and the new law issued for the \noverseas territories together. As a matte r of fact his theoretical representation \ndid not need a ius commune neither as Roman law nor as law produced by \nthe jurists\u2019 interpretation. In the \ufb01rst case because the Roman law had \nalready been nationalized; in the second case because Calasso himself had \nalready streamlined its creative dimension. Moreover, the theoretical repre-\nsentation of Garc\u00eda Gallo was freed both from historicity and spirituality in \nwhich Calasso had instead immerged it because any historical and religious tension had already been selected and made positive. Thus, only two pre-scriptive systems remained in opposition: Castilian and Indian, and with them the \u201cold\u201d problem of unity.\n37This made Calasso\u2019s work still useful. \nT h es o l u t i o nw a si nt h o s ep a g e s ,i nt h ei d e ao ft h es y s t e mt h a th et h e o r i z e d  and in the idea of the state he still evoked. Castilian laws and laws for the West Indies, like\nius commune andius proprium were the elements that inside \na state framework, in a dialectic tension between the general and the partic-\nular, and between common and special, were able to intrinsically and organ-\nically connect in a unitary system.38\n35 M azzacane (1998).\n36 \u201cEl primer libro que me hizo leer fue el Medioevo del diritto de Calasso\u201d stresses Villapalos\n(1996) 14 reminding the \ufb01rst teachings he got from Garc\u00eda Gallo.\n37 On the relationship between Calasso and the philosophic culture of idealist roots A jello\n(2002) 118 ff., 400ff.; from a di fferent point of view also I glesia Ferreir\u00f3s (1999b) insists \non the problem of unity.\n38 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1951); G arc\u00eda Gallo (1971) 177: \u201cel ordenamiento jurid\u00edco no es tan s\u00f3lo \nun conjunto de normas, sino uno aut\u00e9ntico sistema regido por principios y desarrollado \nde modo arm\u00f3nico. \u201d\n174 Luigi Nuzzo4. Claiming an Identity: Carl Schmitt and the Discovery of\nthe New World\nThe end of Franco\u2019s regime and the overcoming of the nationalistic \napproach of Spanish historiography made \ufb01rst the re-discovery of ius com-\nmune possible and then enabled its projection onto the West Indies, imaging \nthere the existence of a unitary and organic system. It was based on the dialectical relationship between the general and the speci\ufb01c, as it also seemed \nto happen in the\nrespublica christiana .\nBefore following the ius commune during its transoceanic journey I think \nit is time to dwell upon the editorial news that was published in Europe at the beginning of the 1950s. While Calasso was re-writing the history of \nmedieval legal thought through the concept of\nius commune and Garc\u00eda \nGallo was including the Spanish Indies within a legislative, Christian and \nnationalistic system, the German jurist Carl Schmitt published Der Nomos \nder Erde im V\u00f6lkerrecht des Jus Publicum Europaeum .39In this book he turned \nagain to international law and, following the same spatial approach to policy \nthat had marked his work in the Twenties, traced the history of the ius \npublicum europaeum from its beginning to its dissolution.40Schmitt\u2019s history \nnot only described Europe\u2019s lost identity under the blows of Kelsen\u2019s formal-\nism and legal universalism, whilst taking the relationship between Ordnung\nandOrtung as a narrative archetype. It also expressed the desire for new amity \nl i n e sa n dw i t ht h e mt h ed e s i r ef o ran e w nomos and a new process of space \nsubdivision.\nThe American claims of a new Western hemisphere, the equalization \nbetween colonial territories and national territories, the move (following the peace conference in Paris) from a European order to a universal one, \nt h et u r no fad i s c r i m i n a t o r yc o n c e p to fw a ra n do ft h ep r e - m o d e r ni d e n t i -\n\ufb01cation between enemy and criminal, had produced the dissolution of the inter-European state system through which the international relationships had been juridically organized for four hundred years. It saw in territorial \n39 S chmitt (1950a).\n40 See especially S chmitt (1940); S chmitt (2005). Schmitt\u2019s interest in international law \nincreased during the 1930s, see the articles S chmitt (1995) edited by Maschke; on the \nmeaning of Gro\u00dfraum in Schmitt see S chm\u00f6ckel (1994) 124 ff.; Carty (2001); on the \nrelationship between geopolitics and Schmitt\u2019s Gro\u00dfraum see L osano (2010) 59 ff.; Galli\n(2010) 864\u2013877.\nBetween America and Europe 175states its protagonists and in the discovery of a new world its pre-condition. \nThe voyages of Columbus allowed Europe to know a free and unlimited \nspace that was ready to be textualized and occupied. The Bulls of Alexander \nVI were the instruments for achieving these aims: they con \ufb01ned the Amer-\nican territories and the Ocean within a legal text and enabled the Landnahme\nof the Catholic powers, Spain and Portugal. They ensured a konkrete Ordnung\nwith the acts of land taking and land distributing that was a founding \nprinciple for organizing the political communities and justifying the posi-\ntivity of the law ( Recht ).41As it is well known the pope gave the new lands to \nthe Castilian sovereigns in order to spread the word of Christ and exposed the indigenous population to the Cathol ic religion. In this way he attributed \na heavy moral obligation to Ferdinando and Isabella and established a legal \ntitle that legitimized the Spanish presence in America in front of the natives \nas well as the other European powers.\nWith another Bull he de\ufb01ned the spatial limits of the Spanish dominion. \nA line traced one hundred miles west from the Azores and running from the \nN o r t hP o l et ot h eS o u t hP o l ed i s t i n g u i s h e dt w od i fferent areas. One was \nreserved for the expansion of the Spaniards; the other could be occupied by t h eP o r t u g u e s e ,a n d ,a tt h es a m et i m e( b yo p p o s i n gt ot h es p a c eo ft h e  \nrespublica christiana ) demarcated the West Indies as an empty and non-quali-\n\ufb01ed spatial and territorial entity.\nEurope needed that empty space for its own existence.\u201cLa civilt\u00e0 europea \n\u2013 Carlo Galli wrote \u2013 esiste solo perch\u00e9 \u00e8 in grado di impossessarsi del nuovo mondo, di occuparlo, di spartirlo, e di con\ufb01nare l\u00e0 \u2013 nello spazio del non Stato \u2013 l\u2019inimicizia assoluta, la limitazione della guerra nell\u2019Europa degli Stati, che si riconoscono l\u2019un l\u2019altro come\nhostes aequaliter justi ; \u00e8 resa possi-\nbile dalle guerre illimitate condotte contro i nativi in America (ma anche in A s i aei nA f r i c a )ea n c h ef r al ep o t e n z ee u r o p e et r ad il o r o ,f u o r id a lc o n -tinente europeo. \u201d\n42But the rajas of Alexander VI were not enough for the \nde\ufb01nition of a new Nomos of the world. Marked on the Ocean, they ignored \nits alterity. They had only a simply distributive function and, presupposing \nthe Pope\u2019s superior authority, still a ffirmed the unity of the respublica chris-\ntiana .\n41 S chmitt (1950a) 81 ff. (it. ed. 1991); see also S chmitt (1953).\n42 G alli (2010) 877\u2013889.\n176 Luigi NuzzoThe emergence of a new order needed, on the contrary, a real revolution \nwith respect to the ordering of territorial spaces. It imposed the overcoming \nof that unity. According to Schmitt it was possible only when England, \n\u201cl\u2019isola che si fece pesce, \u201d entered the debate thanks to a new \u201creligione \nguerriera\u201d: Calvinism.43The amity lines between England and France that \nappeared for the \ufb01rst time in a secret clause of the Cateau Cambresis treaty, \nproduced the de \ufb01nitive disappearance of a world and de \ufb01ned the structure \nof European international law. They rati \ufb01ed the existence of two opposite \nspaces: one, the European land, realm of law and peace; the other, the Ocean and the still unknown American territories. They were free from law and far from the international treaties, and appeared as real and permanent war theaters in which Western colonial impulses could be vented. Beyond the \namity lines the possibilities became endless; there was no more peace and the \nagreements between European powers had no validity.\n44\nFour hundred years later the dissolution of the ius publicum europeum and \nthe deep crisis of the political subjects on whom it was based, ordered the search for a new\nNomos . The perspective, nonetheless, remained a spatial one. \nIn a conference entitled La unidad del mundo , held in Spain in 1951, Schmitt \nexpressed his desire to bring about a \u201ctercera fuerza, \u201d India, Europe, the British Commonwealth, the Hispanic World, the Arabian System or one more force that had not yet been de \ufb01ned. It could break the \u201cworrying \ndualism\u201d \u2013 between East and West, communism and capitalism, enabling \nthe opening of new macro-spatial perspectives and with them making it \npossible to single out a principle for their balance and the de \ufb01nition of a \nnew international law.\n45It was a new law but with a clear analogy with the \n19th and 20th centuries\u2019 law of nations. In fact also this one \u201cse basaba en un \nequilibrio de potencias, gracias al cual se conservaba su estructura. Tambien \nel ius publicum europaeum implicaba una unidad del mundo. Era una unidad Europeoc\u00e9ntrica, no era el poder pol\u00edtico centralista de un \u00fanico due\u00f1o de este mundo, sino una formaci\u00f3n pluralista y un equilibrio de varias fuerzas. \u201d\n46Nevertheless, to reform the unity of the world, a new \n43 S chmitt (1954) (it. ed. 2002, 85).\n44 A synthesis of the historiographical debate in: C assi (2004) 102\u2013114; a critical analysis of \nthe conquest as a production of a new social space in N uzzo (2004) 87 ff.; Ruschi (2004\u2013\n2005) 407 ff.\n45 S chmitt (1950\u20131951), it. ed. 347.\n46 S chmitt (1950\u20131951), it. ed. 348.\nBetween America and Europe 177Christian philosophy of history was also necessary. As a new katechon it could \novercome the dualism between the Marxist philosophy of history and the \nweak historical relativism of the capitalistic West based on progress and \ntechnique. Thus it could o ffer, through an \u201cirrupci\u00f3n concreta de lo eterno \nen el tiempo, \u201d a \ufb01rm answer to the advancement of dialectic materialism.47\nFranco\u2019s Spain was the geographical space from which it was possible to \nstart the reconstruction of the European identity and the achievement of \nt h e s ea i m s .E v e r y t h i n gb e g a ni nS p a i na n di nS p a i ne v e r y t h i n gc o u l dh a v ea  \nnew beginning. The Spanish conquest of a New World and the doctrine of Francisco de Vitoria had brought the scienti \ufb01c and cultural foundation of a \nnew law of nations, producing the \ufb01rst change of the structure of interna-\ntional law.\n48After the end of the Second World War (within a confused and \ndivided Europe) the nationalistic and ultra-conservative Spain seemed to Schmitt the last bulwark. \u201c\u00c8 una coincidenza signi \ufb01cativa \u2013 Schmitt wrote \nin a conference held in 1962 at the Instituto de estudios politicos of Madrid on the occasion of his appointment as a honorary member \u2013 che lo slancio sincero della ricerca mi abbia sempre condotto verso la Spagna. Vedo in \nquest\u2019incontro quasi provvidenziale una prova in pi\u00f9 del fatto che la guerra \ndi liberazione nazionale in Spagna rappresenta una pietra di paragone.

Franco\u2019s seizure of power ten years later and the necessity for a stronger theoretical legitimation of the regime made Schmitt a con-\nstant presence within the political and legal Spanish debate.\n51\n47 S chmitt (1950\u20131951), it. ed. 354; see also S chmitt (1950b) ed. by G.

The \nmarriage of his daughter Anima with Alfonso Varela Otero, a legal historian who taught \nat the University of Santiago de Compostela, strengthened Schmitt\u2019s bond with Spain, see Mehring (2009) 509\u2013510.\n5 1 T h ec o n f e r e n c ew a sh e l di n1 9 2 9a tt h e\nCentro de Intercambio Intelectual Germano-Hispano , \nMadrid and was devoted to Donoso Cortes.\n178 Luigi NuzzoThe historiography reconstructed the relationship between Schmitt and \nSpain and underlined the reception and uses of Schmitt\u2019s legal theory in the \nIberian Peninsula.52\nR e c e n t l yI g n a c i od el aR a s i l l ad e lM o r a l, reconstructing the \u201czero years \nof the Spanish international law, \u201d showed the e ffect of Schmitt\u2019s article, \nEl concepto de imperio en el derecho international , published in the \ufb01rst volume \nof the Revista de estudios politicos , on the representation of a new Franchist \nOrder and underlined how an \u201cendogamous line of continuity\u201d ran through \nthe German jurist, connecting the intellectual as Legaz Lecambra and Fran-cisco Conde with the international lawyers of the post war years.\n53\nIn these subsequent pages I will not mention the relevance of Schmitt in \nthe cultural debate of Franco\u2019s Spain. I will, instead, attempt to highlight \nevidence of omissions.\nAs a matter of fact he was never cited by Garc\u00eda Gallo or by the historians \nofderecho indiano , even though in Spain Schmitt was a highly demanded \nlecturer, his texts were translated in Castilian, his re \ufb02ections on the history of \ntheius publicum europaeum assumed the Spanish conquest as starting point, \nVitoria was one of his protagonists, a legal historian, Otero Varela, was his s o ni nl a wa n d\u00c1 l v a r od \u2019 O r s ,t h em o s t important Spanish professor of \nRoman law, had friendly relations with him.\n54\nWhy? I will put forward two assumptions and leave the reader to choose \nthe one he or she might like best.\nThe omission could be either the spontaneous fruit of the shabby nation-\nalism of the legal historians of Franco\u2019s Spain that were not really interested in what was happening outside the borders of their country and their dis-cipline, or the consequence of their scienti \ufb01c limitation of understanding \nthe theoretical force of Schmitt\u2019s construction. Otherwise this omission could be the consequence of a historiographic strategy that was targeted at the anti-formalist approach of Schmitt or it could be the consequence of his interpretation of Vitoria free from the common universalistic stereotypes. \n52 See especially B eyneto (1983); L \u00f3pez Garc\u00eda (1996).\n53 R asilla del Moral (2012). I would like to thank Ignacio de la Rasilla del Moral for \nsending me his article.\n54 It is interesting to underline the absence of any references to Schmitt in the work of \nGarc\u00eda Gallo (1957\u20131958) 467\u2013476 on Alexander\u2019s Bulls that is opened with a biblio-\ngraphical recognition.\nBetween America and Europe 179It could also be due to the refusal to recognize in the conquest or in the \nviolence of the Landnahme the qualifying factor of the Spanish presence in \nthe West Indies or the starting point of the international law\u2019s constitutive process.\n55\n5. Claiming an Identity: V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui and\nthe New Horizons of the derecho indiano\nDuring the 1970s the legal historiography started to become aware of the need for a deep methodological renewal under the pressure of the social and economic transformations that were sweeping through Europe. In addition, the more sensitive Spanish jurists took part to this debate.\n56In 1977 the \nPeset brothers and two years later Bartolom\u00e9 Calvero harshly criticized the methodology of Garc\u00eda Gallo and revisited the image that Hinojosa\u2019s school had imposed.\nThey came back to highlight the historical dimension of the law, under-\nlining its relationship with social rea lity and economic structure, locating \nthe most relevant reasons for Spanish historiographic backwardness and indifference towards a European historical phenomenon as\nius commune\nand the constitutional history of 19th century Spain in the nationalistic glori \ufb01cation of the Hispanic diversity.\n57And while Garc\u00eda Gallo still in \n1979 held fast to his dogmatic approach and ascribed the little attention \ngiven by Spanish jurists to ius commune to the importance of the German \ncomponent of Spanish law in the early Middle Ages, Francisco Tom \u00e1sy  \nValiente took the last step toward overcoming Garc\u00eda Gallo\u2019s method.58\nHe closed a revisionist process he started in 1976 in an article with the same \n55D e rN o m o sd e rE r d e was translated into Spanish only in 1979, but the guidelines of the \nbook already appear from the conferences and the article translated into Spanish that I \nhave quoted in these pages.\n56 S cholz (1980).\n57 P eset Jos\u00e9Luis y Mariano (1977); P eset (1978); C lavero (1979). The \ufb01rst signs of the \nSpanish methodological renewal are already in C lavero (1974). The same Sevillan Review \nHistoria, Instituciones, Documentos directed by Mart\u00ednez Gij\u00f3n was one of textual space \nwhere the new themes and the treatment of methodological problems could be a fforded \nfreedom within the pages of the Anuario that was not possible in Madrid at the time. \nAlmost twenty years later P etit (1993b) 407 de \ufb01ned it as \u201c\u00faltimo recurso al alcance de \ndisidentes\u201d .\n58 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1980). But see also G arc\u00eda Gallo (1986) and (1988).\n180 Luigi Nuzzotitle as the famous conference Garc\u00eda Gallo held in Rome.59According to \nTom\u00e1s y Valiente the article a ffirmed that it was no longer possible to con-\nceive legal history as Garc\u00eda Gallo did in 1952, but also that \u201cla direcci\u00f3n \nhacia la que Garc\u00eda Gallo hab\u00eda orientado te\u00f3ricamente la Historia del de-recho en Espa\u00f1a, vista sobre todo desde la triple perspectiva del Manual, de sus propios fundamentos y de la caracterizaci\u00f3n global del Anuario, no parec\u00eda convincente. \u201d\n60\nWhen Spain joined the European Community in 1986, Helmut Coing \npresented at the I Simposio Internacional del Instituto de Derecho Com\u00fan a \npaper meaningfully entitled Espa\u00f1a y Europa, un pasado jur\u00eddico com\u00fan .H e  \nrecognized the end of Spanish diversity and the belongings of the Spanish culture to European history. The director of the most important European \ninstitute of legal history, the Max Planck Institute in Frankfurt am Main, \nenabled Spain to gain access to the shared memory of the old\nius commune , \nand affirmed the role played by the 16th century Spanish theologians in the \nprocess of the transformation of law as a legal science.61Unquestionably, the \nhistory recited by the director of Max Planck was nothing more than \u201cthe \noldtranslatio studii with a few super \ufb01c i a lp a t c h e st oc o v e ri t sn a k e d n e s s ,a  \nfew sops to the peddlers of unstable legal currency. \u201d62That is an umpteenth \nversion of the myth of the history of European law: it was conceived in Italy, \ndeveloped in France, improved in Holland and apexed at the Pandectistic school in Germany. Coing, nevertheless, introduced for his Spanish public \nan important variant: he certi \ufb01ed the existence of the\nius commune in the \njuridical Spanish inheritance, legitimizing the work carried out by the Iber-\nian legal historians, and admitted the champions of the Second Scholastic in the European legal history.\nThree years later, in 1989, in a conference organized by the\nCentro di studi \nper la storia del pensiero giuridico moderno , Spanish historiography was ready \nto go on stage, and submitted itself to a kind of \u2018group psychotherapy\u2019 in front of the Italian colleagues.\n63In the introductory paper Tom\u00e1 syV a l i e n t e  \n59 T om\u00e1syValiente (1976a); see also T om\u00e1syValiente (1976b).\n60 T om\u00e1syValiente (1981) 3640.\n61 C oing (1986).\n62 O sler (1997).\n63 C lavero /Grossi /Tom\u00e1syValiente (1990) 633\u2013654, see the review by S errano Gonz\u00e1-\nlez(1990).\nBetween America and Europe 181de\ufb01nitively denyed the representation of the escuela de Hinojosa offered by \nhim. Tom \u00e1s y Valiente disclosed the ideological manipulation of Garc\u00eda Gallo \nand challenge the very existence of a school of Hinojosa and later of Garc\u00eda \nGallo.64This was not the only thing. The organizers were conscious that a \nconference on Hispania had to investigate the legal projection of its image on \nthe overseas dominions. Thus they entrusted V\u00edctor Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui with the \ntask of explaining the exoticism of the derecho indiano and its relationships \nwith the ius commune and the Castilian law. And Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui (not for-\ngetting the paper presented by Coing in Murcia, \ufb01rst quotation), further-\nmore claimed that it was impossible to understand and describe the ius \ncommune in Spain \u201csin tener debidamente en cuenta ese singular fen\u00f3meno \nde expansi\u00f3n jur\u00eddica en el espacio Atl \u00e1ntico. \u201d65\nSubsequently the derecho indiano and its protagonists as well as Castilian \nlaw and its jurists were knocking at the door of European legal history. There were \u201cun \u00fanico sistema jur\u00eddico de ra\u00edz europea continental\u201d , and \u201c u n a\u00fa n i c au n i d a dd ee s t u d i o \u201di n t ow h i c h\nius commune , Castilian law and \nderecho indiano merged. Garc\u00eda Gallo and his innumerable works kept o ffer-\ning Tau the methodological coordinat es and the irreplaceable portrait of a \ncentripetal system. The object of those methodological coordinates and of that system, however, appeared to be much more complex in the paper presented by Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui than it seemed if one read the texts of Garc\u00eda \nGallo or those legal historians that in the same years also saw in the West \nIndies the European systemic relationship between\nius commune and iura \npropria imagined by Calasso for medieval Italy, and used the Christian values \nofius commune for reading the Crown\u2019s engagement in favor of the natives \nand for justifying their submission.\nV\u00edctor Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui kept on declaring his debt to Garc\u00eda Gallo, but at \nthe same time proudly remembered his a ffiliation to the school of Ricardo \nLevene and, following the historiographic tradition inaugurated by Levene \nand Altamira (that Garc\u00eda Gallo had always criticized because of their lack of legal disposition), sought to restore the complexity of the\nderecho indiano .66\n64 T om\u00e1syValiente (1990); T om\u00e1syValiente (1993\u20131994); see also S\u00e1 nchez-A rcilla Ber-\nnal(2003) 7\u201319, 48\u201368.\n65 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1990); M artir\u00e9 (2001) and (2003).\n66 The great attention devoted by the Argentinean school towards history had already been \ntesti\ufb01ed by M artir\u00e9 (1969); on Argentinean legal history see A b\u00e1solo (2008).\n182 Luigi NuzzoWithin a common history the derecho indiano was a di fferent type of knowl-\nedge and its identity could not easily be bridled by the idea of legislative or \njurisprudential system. Besides, the system of Garc\u00eda Gallo was not an his-\ntorical reality, but a projection of his positivistic and nationalistic theory.67\nTau Anzo \u00e1tegui recognized the merits of the Spanish professor and under-\nl i n e dh i st i m i da p p r o a c ht ot h en e wm e t hodological proposals during the \n1980s, but he did not fail to keep distance from him. Some years later, for \nexample, in a methodological work on the prospects of the derecho indiano , \nhe not only recognized that \u201cpersiste en la historiograf\u00eda, en dosis muy altas, \nla fuerza modeladora de la cultura legalista, \u201d but also invited the legal histor-ians to reconstruct the (broken?) relationships between law and the social net and to substitute \u201ca cultura legalista con una cultura jur\u00eddica. \u201d\n68Only a \njuridical culture could have truly enabled the \u201csituar la ley dentro del orde-namiento en su verdadero lugar, seg\u00fan la materia y las \u00e9pocas, y habr\u00eda hecho posible una \u2018lectura inteligente\u2019 \u2013 que no es ingenua ni maliciosa \u2013 de los textos legales, interrog \u00e1n d o l o sal al u zd eu n ac o n c e p c i \u00f3 na m p l i ad e lf e n \u00f3 -\nmeno jur\u00eddico. \u201d\n69The awareness of this complexity made it possible to \ndevote attention to the other sources of law: customs, doctrine, and juris-prudence.\n70It was something of a desire that Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui himself \nattempted to satisfy with two important books published in 1992. The \ufb01rst,\nLa ley en Hispanoam\u00e9rica ,w a si nf a c td e v o t e dt ot h ed i fferent sources \nof the derecho indiano , and the second, meaningfully titled Casuismo y siste-\nma, was a historical investigation on its esp\u00edritu .71\nMoreover, Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui was searching for the identity of the derecho \nindiano , but the discovery or the re-discovery of the legal pluralisms to which \nits research was leaning, was no longer a problem that had to be overcome, \nnor was it the starting point of an investigation necessarily addressed at \nfocusing a superior unity. The system had not disappeared and hanged dan-gerously with its German rigor over the unordered world of the Spanish Indies. Similarly, the idealistic tension that sustained his project could have reproduced the dream of a spiritual and legal unity, making it again possible \n67 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992b) 63.\n68 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997b) 41.\n69 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997b) 43.\n70 See T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1986) and (1989).\n71 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992c) and (1992a).\nBetween America and Europe 183to tell the old story of a conquest without conquest nor conquered popula-\ntions in which the radical native alterity could be dissolved without resid-\nuals.\nNevertheless, in the theoretical representation of Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui the \nsystem had an element that counter balanced it. Beyond and against the \nsystem there was another category of interpretation, the casuismo .I tw a s  \ntoo an \u201canachronistic\u201d concept, as Tau Anz \u00e1tegui himself underlined. It \nwas a word that once again had nothing to do with facts but that rather dealt with interpretations, helping us to enter into a \u201ccultura com\u00fan refrac-taria a la idea de sistema. \u201d\n72Thederecho indiano was an ordenamiento casuista , \na pluralistic order that re \ufb02ected the pluralism of the political world of \nSpanish Indies and was able to bravely resist attempts to rationalize the \nsystem\nSetting the \u201ccreencia casuistica\u201d against \u201cidea sistematica, \u201d Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui \ntook back the texts to their contexts and brought back the law into the social \nworld, enabling the critics of a idealistic approach to share his \u201cunder-ground\u201d explorations \u201cdebajo de la legi slaci\u00f3n, la jurisprudencia o la activi-\ndad judicial. \u201d\n73\u201cEl derecho indiano \u2013 Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui wrote in the epilogue \n\u2013 aparece como un ordenamiento abierto a distintos modos de creaci\u00f3n \u2013 normas legales, costumbres, jurisprudencia de los autores, pr \u00e1ctica judicial, \nejemplares, equidad, etc. \u2013 con ciertos principios rectores y leyes generales, pero con vastos espaci\u00f3s para disposiciones particulares, privilegios, excep-\nciones y dispensas. La materia, las personas, el tiempo y las circustancias eran \natendidas preferentemente en la soluci\u00f3n de los casos dentro una sociedad que luc\u00eda sus estamentos o estados. \u201d\n74\nAt the \ufb01ve hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America (within a \nsolid historiographic tradition and for the readers with fairly conservative tastes) he o ffered a deeply innovatory lecture on the American world that, I \n72 P etit (1993a) 676. \u201cA riesgo de sorprender al mesurado V\u00edctor Tau con formulaciones \nradicales \u2013 Carlos Petit wrote, 669 \u2013 situar\u00e9 Casuismo y sistema en el terreno as\u00ed acotado \nde una histor\u00edogra \ufb01a de creaci\u00f3n que, siendo jur\u00eddica, encuentra adem \u00e1s implicaciones en \nla experienc\u00eda de derecho presente y a\u00fan puede proyectarse hacia el futuro. \u201d This brings \nPetit to conclude (671): \u201cla formaci\u00f3n que acre dita V\u00edctor Tau es s\u00f3lidamente tradicional, \nmas ya lo ser\u00eda menor su mismo pensamiento; Casuismo y sistema , a despecho de la nutrita \nbibliograf\u00eda que lo acompa\u00f1a, ser\u00eda entonces un libro radicalmente (post)moderno. \u201d\n73 P etit (1993a) 668.\n74 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992a) 570.\n184 Luigi Nuzzolike to think, could have caused doubts and perplexities in Garc\u00eda Gallo and \nin his numerous scholars.\nInCasuismo y sistema V\u00edctor Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui did not directly face the \nproblem of the natives. However, the construction of the legal indigenous order as a casuistic order that was open to the diversities and to the neces-sities of praxis, allowed a more conscious re \ufb02ection on the role of the indige-\nnous populations in the Hispanic American society and at the same time \nencouraged re\ufb02 ection on the control strategies used by the jurists to deny \nnative diversity. The legal pluralism did not anticipate postmodern feelings \nnor did it arrange them in an ordered and constitutional plan for rights and different subjects that were destined to be sacri \ufb01ced on the altar of legal \nformalism of modernity. On the contrary, through di fferent means swinging \nbetween protection and repression \u2013 the application of some old legal status to indigenous, their introduction into Spanish procedural law, the imposi-tion of the Castilian language, forced urbanization and obviously their con-version to the Catholic faith \u2013 it had the aim of one day overcoming the diversity of indigenous populations and erasing their memory.\nBibliography\nAb\u00e1solo ,Ezequiel (2008), Argentinische rechtshistorische Forschung 1989\u20132004, \nin: Zeitschri ftf\u00fcr Neuere Rechtsgeschichte 30, 242\u2013258\nAjello ,Raffaele (2002), Il collasso di Astrea.

Introduction\nOn 19 March 2007, a Chilean citizen \ufb01led an appeal challenging as uncon-\nstitutional a Court Regulation issued by the Court of Appeals in and for the city of Santiago in October 1995.The details of the proceedings are irrelevant here; what is noteworthy is that the judgment that put an end to the pro-\nceedings has been considered a true\nhistoric landmark . Indeed, not only was it \nthe\ufb01r s tt i m et h a ta na c t i o na g a i n s tt h ei n t e r f e r e n c ew i t hf u n d a m e n t a lr i g h t s  \nwas admitted before the Constitutional Court, but it was also the \ufb01rst time \nthat the Chilean High Court had declared partly unconstitutional a Court \nRegulation issued by the courts of justice.1\nAlthough this development sparked great interest among specialists and \nlay people, I am aware that it is unrelated to the topic of this publication; furthermore, readers could wonder: What relevance to the renewal of legal historiography might a topic of debate about American or European con-stitutional case law have? What relation is there, if any, between the labor of \nconstitutional courts and the history of Spanish colonial law on which this \nbook is focused? Or, lastly, has V\u00edctor Tau ever addressed the study of the concentrated control of constitutionality?\nF i r s t l y ,i nr e p l yt ot h el a s tq u e s t i o n ,Im u s ta d m i tt h a tIa mn o tf a m i l i a r  \nwith any work by the Argentine legal historian on the creation of the control \nof constitutionality,\n2the multiplication of constitutional courts,3or\ufb01nally \n* DER2014-56291-C3-1-P .

I also believe that its analysis may lead to the formulation of proposals aimed at the renewal of legal historiography as regards the study of colonial law. It is well-known that opening up new themat ic and methodological horizons has \nbeen a constant concern for V\u00edctor Tau;\n8yet, I will quote one of his earliest \nthoughts, from an interview almost twenty years ago:\n\u201cI believe that one of the major topics deserving the attention of scholars is what can \nbe called the Law of the Indies at the transitional stage towards the formation of \nnational law systems. \u201d9\nV\u00edctor Tau himself has developed some aspects of his proposal,10but his \nworks will not be analyzed in the following pages; instead, the aim is simply \nto try to draw attention to some problematic aspects of the study of transi-\ntional law. The \ufb01rst aspect is evident: is it appropriate to include the Chilean \ncase within the Law of Transition? It should be borne in mind that answer-i n gt h i sq u e s t i o ni nt h ea ffirmative suggests that not even at the time when \n\u201cnational law systems were formed, \u201d\n11w a sa ne n dp u tt ow h a th i s t o r i a n s  \nhave called the vestiges or remnants of the Law of the Indies in national laws .12\nIt is not necessary to be a specialized linguist to realize that the preceding terms somehow convey the idea of a residual. Therefore, this work is chie \ufb02y \naimed at questioning the use of such terms in the study of transitional law \n4O tto(1987).\n5Tau/Matir\u00e8 (2003).\n6Tau(1992a).\n7Tau(1992b).\n8Tau(1997).\n9Enciso Contreras /DelConacyt (1993).\n10 T au(1977b); T au(2007\u20132008).\n11 T au(1977a).\n12 G uzm\u00e1n(2010).\n194 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enahistory, which forces me to start from the very beginning, that is, by trying to \nprove that the Chilean case must be included in the list of well-known \nvestiges or remnants.\nII. Colonial Remnants in the 21st Century? From Formal Constitution \nto Material Constitution in the Republic of Chile\nFor a legal historian, the following paragraph of the Chilean judgment is \nworthy of attention:\n\u201cThis ample reference hampers the accurate de \ufb01nition of the scope of economic \npowers since, on the one hand, the reference is too vague: \u2018manner of operation of \nthe courts.\u2019 The manner of proceeding in disciplinary matters is, for certain, a \nmanner of operation (\u2026) The absence of further examples impedes de \ufb01ning the \nscope given by lawmakers to these powers. The narrow regulatory scope intended by t h ea p p l i c a n tf o r\nCourt Regulations is not in line with the tradition of the important \nmatters which have been thus regulated since Colonial times, by the Real Audiencia \ufb01rst, \nand by the Supreme Court later. Therefore, it is necessary to de \ufb01ne the scope of this power at \nthe constitutional level. \u201d13(Emphasis added.)\nThe Chilean High Court has given constit utional hierarchy to the continuity \nbetween the Reales Audiencias of the Indies and the republican courts, in the \nunderstanding that the latter must be seen as an institutional reformulation \nof the former institutions. Nonetheless, by reading the paragraph tran-\nscribed, something that may concern legal historians can be inferred, since \neven if the Court acknowledges that the boundaries delimiting the regula-tory scope of Court Regulations issued by Chilean courts are blurry, it immediately goes on to a ffirm that\ntradition , rather than the very confusing \ncurrent norms, must set the boundaries of such regulatory scope. The fact \nthat the scholarly debate sparked by the judgment has been partly expressed \nin historicist terms is no coincidence. Having set the groundwork, I believe that the Chilean case helps legal historians free themselves from the endemic \nloneliness inherent in their work,14ensuring them a place in this topical \ndebate.\n13 A ldunate (2007) 229.\n14 C aroni (2005).\nMore than just Vestiges 1951. Terminological considerations: domestic power,\nimmemorial practice and, \ufb01nally, Court Regulations\nThe Chilean Constitutional Court ruling partly agrees with the academic \nsector that identi \ufb01es the regulatory scope of Court Regulations with the \npower of self-organization of state organs, a power o ften called domestic . \nHowever, it is worth recalling that this term has quite a strong connotation. In fact, any legal historian would stress that\ndomestic power has a historical \nmeaning that greatly hinders its current use. As is widely known, the histor-ical roots of domestic power can be traced back to ancient times.\n15None-\ntheless, this concept managed to survive by integrating and reformulating itself within the culture of\nius commune ,w h i c hd o m i n a t e dW e s t e r nl e g a l  \nthinking at least until the revolutionary crises.16\nTo simplify, it could be stated that for such a culture, domestic power was \nnot subject to the law, but rather a direct and largely arbitrary power of the father of a family, which based on love, did not exclude violence.\n17Undoubt-\nedly, the phrase domestic power sheltered for centuries the most obscure \nsector of the government of men on both sides of the Atlantic. Thus, for instance, in her study on the \u201cpopulated house\u201d in San Miguel de Tucum \u00e1n, \nRomina Zamora highlighted the operability that such corpus of texts on \noeconomics \u2013 so interesting for the great Austrian historian18\u2013 had in the \nHispanic world in the late 18th century. The conclusions drawn by Zamora\u2019s \nstudy and other similar pieces of research show that there was no reduction \nin the scope of the ancient domestic power of the 19th century.19Accord-\ningly, it cannot be exclusively identi \ufb01ed with the power granted to Spanish \nand American judiciaries,20given that the survival of domestic power within \nthe sphere theoretically pertaining to individual rights was very common \nthroughout the 1800s.21In short, there is nothing natural, if I may say so, in \nattributing such power to courts.\n15 B runner (1977).\n16 V allejo (1998).\n17 H espanha (1997).\n18 Z amora (2010).\n19 T \u00edoVallejo (2001).\n20 S olla (2011).\n21 A g\u00fcero (2010); T \u00edoVallejo (2010).\n196 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enaAnother point to consider is the fact that a wide sector of the Chilean \nacademia insists on underlining the regulatory nature of Court Regulations \nby focusing more on form than on substance, provided it is understood that \nthe latter means quantity and quality of the contents said Court Regulations may govern. This has considerable e ffects on the control of constitutionality \nof such provisions. In any case, what must be emphasized is that a sector of academia has contended that such regulations are rooted on\nimmemorial \npractice .22W h i l ei ti st r u et h a tf o rs o m ep e o p l es u c hp r a c t i c ei n c o r p o r a t e s  \ntraditional elements into the Chilean source system impregnating it with irrationality,\n23it is also true that, beyond this kind of criticism, the mere use \nof the phrase immemorial practice suggests speci \ufb01c thoughts to legal histor-\nians.\nThus, for example, one could wonder: What connection can be estab-\nlished between the word \u201cimmemorial\u201d and the ancient constitution ?E v e n  \nthough this term has had a prominent place in many legal systems, history offers some representative examples of its usage in the constitutional terrain. \nAs Pocock rightly demonstrated many years ago, it was certainly English \nconstitutionalism that used it more e ffectively for the purposes of placing \ncommon law o u t s i d et h es c o p eo fp o l i t i c a lp o w e r ( s ) .24Later on, American \nrevolutionaries resorted to a similar discursive strategy, which would have \ntremendous consequences for constitutional history. As expressed by an expert:\n\u201cThe British who opposed the American version of the constitution were \u2018looking \nahead,\u2019 away from the ancient constitution, to government by consent, to a con-\nstitution of parliamentary command, in which government was entrusted with \narbitrary power and civil rights were grants from the sovereign. The Americans were \n\u2018looking backward,\u2019 not to government by consent but to government by the rule of law, to a sovereign that did not grant rights but was limited by rights. \u201d\n25\nIt is true that not many parallelisms can be drawn between the current \nChilean constitutional issues and the political con \ufb02icts that confronted the \nEnglish Monarchy with its Parliament during the 17th century. However, it should be recalled that one thing is to protect immemorial possession and \n22 A ldunate (2009a).\n23 A ldunate (2009b).\n24 P ocock (1957).\n25 R eid(2005) 52.\nMore than just Vestiges 197quite another is to transfer that idea to the realm of constitutional powers. \nIt is in this sense that we might point out that insofar as Chilean legal \npractice does not go back beyond the creation of the Real Audiencia ,26the \npower granted to its successor institutions does not stem from the dark and \ninde\ufb01nite mists of time, but rather from the political will of some very \ndetermined men. The term \u201cimmemorial\u201d is not used in an attempt to \nprotect the rights of individuals; it is on ly an institutional practice directly \nlinked to a way of understanding the law and its management which comes from a world where the\nAudiencias of the Indies identi \ufb01ed with the source of \nall jurisdiction, id est ,w i t ht h eK i n g .27\nNonetheless, this widely known story about the political uses of the \nancient Constitution, coincident with the immemorial practices that were \nso deeply rooted in the Hispanic world, does not concern the most classical \nChilean constitutional scholars at all. Not only do they accept the existence of Court Regulations naturally, they also contend that they make up a body of general and abstract rules generally issued by collegiate courts aimed at imposing measures or giving instructions for the most expeditious and effi -\ncient operation of the judiciary.\n28In short, the new Audiencias into which \nthe republican courts turned have further reinforced their self-government p o w e r ,e x t e n d i n gi tb e y o n dt h a to ft h e\nAudiencias of the Indies, since the \ncurrent system of distribution of competencies is based on regulation and on the predominance of a formal Constitution.\nThere is little doubt that keeping ancient legal terminology contributes to \nthe legitimacy of continuity. However, while the phrase \u201cCourt Regulations\u201d currently has high standing in Chile, the same does not occur in other states that once shared Chile\u2019s legal tradition.\n29The Chilean continuity is striking, \nbecause it makes it clear that the political gap opened in 1808 did not a ffect \nthe survival of the legal tradition in the Spanish American territories.30This \ncan be proved with a single piece of information: the Dictionaries published \nthroughout the 1700s in the Peninsula de \ufb01ned the term \u201cCourt Regulation\u201d \n26 B arrientos (2003).\n27 G arriga (2004a).\n28 S ilva Bascu\u00f1 \u00e1n(2005) 156.\n29 T au(1990).\n30 A g\u00fcero (unpublished).\n198 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enain the old sense.31Nevertheless, the latest edition of the Diccionario de la \nLengua Espa\u00f1ola [Spanish Language Dictionary] published by the Real Aca-\ndemia Espa\u00f1ola [Royal Spanish Academy] states that the meaning of the term \nis:\n\u201cIn ancient Law, a decision taken as a general point by a supreme court or council \nwith the attendance of all of its divisions. \u201d32\nSuch ancient law was kept alive in the colonial Spain of the 19th century, but \nnot in the present one, governed by the Constitution of 1978.33Conversely, \nChile has undergone a rare metamorphosis that has enabled it to become \npart of the regulatory typology determined by the Constitution in force. As \nsome Chilean authors have been claiming, there are still many legal mech-\nanisms created at the core of the Law of the Indies that still survive there, \nbesides Court Regulations. This is the case, by way of example, of the ancient \u2018consultation\u2019 process, consisting of the rati \ufb01cation by an upper court of \nthose resolutions deemed too importa nt to be decided just by a lower court, \neven without a party\u2019s request. Although this consultation process was com-monplace in times of the Spanish Monarchy,\n34it does not have any parallel \nin Comparative Law.35Legal historians cannot be indi fferent to this partic-\nular terminological continuity; furthermore, I believe that understanding and explaining it is one of their most important duties. Court Regulations, \nconsultations, visits \u2026 These are all words that have survived in some places, \nbut disappeared in others. Their mere existence or inexistence indicates a \n31 The term Court Regulation was not included in the well-known Diccionario de Autori-\ndades , but in the following one: http://buscon.rae.es/ntlle/SrvltGUILoginNtlle.

Many decades have \npassed since Paolo Grossi called for c ollaboration between historians and \njurists,37but I \ufb01rmly believe that there are not many opportunities for this \nas offered by the analysis of the Chilean case. Indeed, the complex combi-\nnation of tradition and will, or, if preferred, between Court Regulations and \nconstitutional normativity, has stimulated a very interesting debate on the adequacy or inadequacy of history to a constitutional order based on the recognition of fundamental rights.\n38While part of the academia insists that \nthe Political Constitution of the Repub lic of Chile does not include a single \narticle expressly empowering the Supreme Court to issue Court Regulations, another part maintains that such power is the most important manifestation of the traditional economic superintendence entrusted to said Court, which is currently found in Article 82 (amend ed text of the previous Article 79 of \nthe Constitution).\n39This latter sector of academia repeatedly resorts to his-\ntoricist legitimation in order to justify the attribution of an important reg-ulatory power to the judiciary,\n40regardless of the framework of the well-\nknown superintendence granted to the Court and understood as a legacy of the ancient\nReal Audiencia ,w h i c h ,i na d d i t i o n ,i sa l s os a i dt ob es h a r e db y  \nother Supreme Courts.41\nWe should recall that it was not Chilean legal scholars but the Constitu-\ntional Court itself that decided that both the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction to issue Court Regulations.\n42By way of simpli-\n\ufb01cation, it could be argued that the Court has empowered courts to con-\ntinue acting as they did before and a fter Chilean independence. In the words \nof another author:\n36 E. g.: Autos, acuerdos y decretos de gobierno del Real y Supremo Consejo de las Indias, \nMadrid 1658.\n37 G rossi (1972) 2.\n38 S ilva (2009); P feffer (2010); U senVicencio (2010); V\u00e1 squez M\u00e1rquez (2010).\n39 D elgado (2010) 802.\n40 A ldunate (2009b).\n41 Z \u00fa\u00f1iga (1998).\n42 Sentencia Rol N\u00ba 783 (2007): \u201cSi el art\u00edculo 93 n\u00ba 2 de la Carta fundamental otorga a esta \nMagistratura competencia para revisar la constitucionalidad de estas normas, es evidente \nq u ev a l i d ae s t ac o m p e t e n c i a \u201d .\n200 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1ena\u201cWhat turns out to be inconsistent in the precedents of the Constitutional Court \nanalyzed herein is that the abstract control of constitutionality \ufb01nally protects the \nregulatory powers of the high courts of justice, anchored in the independence of this \nbranch of Government, and especially of the Supreme Court, boasting of a decision \non legal policy of absolute deference to the Judiciary; although this is hard to \nreconcile with the Rule of Law, which requires observance of the principle of \nlegality and of the distribution of regulatory power that places legislation at the \ntop of the hierarchy of the sources of Law; this priority is protected by the principle \nof democracy. \u201d43\nFor an observer outside the Chilean constitutional debate, the regulatory \npower granted to the courts con \ufb02icts with the concepts of national sover-\neignty, formal legislation and separation of powers, which are supposed to be fundamental for modern constitutionalism.\n44This imaginary observer is \nfurther taken aback when \ufb01nding out, in addition, that from the dissolution \nof the Real Audiencia of Santiago de Chile in 1817 to the present time, Court \nRegulations issued by Chilean courts have addressed very general and sig-\nni\ufb01cant issues, such as the formal aspects of judgments, protection or amparo\nproceedings [summary proceeding for the protection of constitutional rights or guarantees] and the action for compensation for miscarriage of justice. Moreover, several Court Regulations issued by the ancient\nReal Audiencia of \nSantiago maintained full force and eff ect in the Republic of Chile until the \nearly 20th century.45So, notwithstanding the task of jurists is the analysis of \nwhether Court Regulations are constitutional or not, the historical concepts used by the Constitutional Court to legi timize the existence and the scope of \nCourt Regulations raise manifold doubts regarding their compliance with the basic principles of what we have come to understand as the Rule of \nLaw.\n46\nThis is the point where legal experts should pay attention to legal histor-\nians, who face a task full of challenges, especially that of trying to recreate \nthe complex history of Court Regulati ons in order to understand what they \nwere and what they currently are. In order to undertake this task reasonably, \nthe role played by Court Regulations m ust be contextualized during the \ndifferent stages of legal tradition, where casuistry and system coexisted for \nmany years.\n43 Z \u00fa\u00f1iga (2011) 415.\n44 G rimm (2006).\n45 B arrientos (2014) T\u00edtulo preliminar.\n46 C osta (2002).\nMore than just Vestiges 2012. Jurisdictionalism v. statism. The Real Audiencia of Santiago, its Court \nRegulations and, ultimately, the power of custom in the present-day \nRepublic of Chile\nThe history of the Real Audiencia of Santiago, meticulously narrated by Javier \nBarrientos,47is not very clear on the intersection between the economic \nand / or domestic functions of the Real Audiencia relative to superintendence \nand the issuance of Court Regulations; furthermore, what Barrientos has described is precisely the opposite. Up to its dissolution in 1817, the\nReal \nAudiencia of Santiago felt no limitation whatsoever to issue Court Regula-\ntions, and these actually dealt with all kinds of matters.48Later on, the Court \nof Appeals, which replaced the Real Audiencia in the \ufb01rst constitutional \ninterregnum, did exactly the same.49I refer readers to Javier Barrientos\u2019 \nthorough analysis on this matter, and I will only point out that to determine \nthe regulatory scope mentioned by the Constitutional Court, which attrib-utes it to the traditional operation of the\nReal Audiencia , a careful reading of \nall the Court Regulations it issued is required. Nonetheless, challenges \nremain ahead; as I believe V\u00edctor Tau would say, the Court Regulations issued \nby Councils and Reales Audiencias responded to these casuistic beliefs that \nd o m i n a t e dt h el e g a la r e n au n t i lt h el a t e1 8 t hc e n t u r y .\nThe following question can be posed based on the foregoing: How can \nwe expect to make systemic abstractions today on historic material that \ncompletely ignored them at the time?50Once again, projecting current legal \ncategories in an attempt to \ufb01ll the well-known superintendence attributed \nto the Supreme Court distorts the history of that government of justice that \ndiffered so much from what we now know as statism.51Indeed, it was this \nkind of government which managed the Indies,52although it did so by \n47 B arrientos (2000a).\n48 B arrientos (2000b).\n49 B arrientos (unpublished).\n50 V entura Bele\u00f1a (1789).

In this same vein, it is worth mention-\ning a subtle warning by V\u00edctor Tau:\n\u201cThis prevailing criterion of the so-called legal business in the sphere of legal deci-\nsions also covered government a ffairs. A writing of 1714, regarding the management \nof such aff airs, stated that in the Consejo de Indias [Council of the Indies], \u2018it is \nunusual to \ufb01nd a \ufb01le or business which, though denominated governmental, does \nnot contain a great deal of civil, canonical or municipal precedents, laws of the \nKingdom, laws of the Indies, Ordinances, resolutions, Bulls and special charters of \n53 M artir\u00e9 (2005).\n54 H espanha (1986).\n55 G arriga (2004b).\n56 G\u00f3 ngora (1981).\n57 B ulnes (1982).\n58 G\u00f3 ngora Escobedo (1990).\n59 G\u00f3 ngora (1951) 301.\n60 A g\u00fcero (2007).\n61 G arriga (2006b).\n62 M alag \u00f3n(2005).

Such continuity was strengthened with the adoption of the Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure of 1902 and 1906, respectively. A further step was \ntaken in 1971 with the enactment of a law ordering that a subsection be \n63 T au(1992a) 509.\n64 H espanha (2000) 5\u201318.\n65 T au(1997).\n66 H espanha (1984); H espanha (2005) 33\u201335.\n67 B arrientos (unpublished) 37.\n204 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enaincluded into Section 96 of the Organic Code of Chilean Courts, which \nstated that \u201call court regulations of a general application and nature issued \nby the Supreme Court shall be published in the O fficial Gazette. \u201d68And, \nlastly, that even when the Chilean Constitutional Court has exercised control \nover Court Regulations, it has in turn given constitutional value to a pre-constitutional regulatory power.\nIt is possible to attempt to integrate this special example of colonial \nsurvival, if it can be de \ufb01ned as such, within the Chilean legal order; as is \nwidely known, judges and jurists have displayed and continue to display great imagination.\n69However, it could be said that such power either pur-\nports to have a certain originary nature or, as I believe V\u00edctor Tau would say, it \nforces us to acknowledge the strength of the power of custom in Chile in the \n21st century.70At this point, the spirit of Andr\u00e9s Bello holding his famous \nCode appears before historians, who, rather surprised, can only wonder: What has happened with the strong assertion according to which \u201cfollowing the example of almost all modern Codes, custom has been deprived of the force of law\u201d?\n71\nTo sum up, since the existence of Court Regulations has gained rati \ufb01ca-\ntion in constitutional precedents,72it can certainly be stated that if some \naspects of the ancient constitution remain,73t h eo n l yp o s s i b l ec o n c l u s i o ni s  \nthe following: the long-standing struggle between formal Constitution and material Constitution still continues in the Republic of Chile in the 21st \ncentury.\n74\n3.

My aim is to answer both \nquestions brie \ufb02y henceforth; but since it is not possible to encompass the \nstudy of these matters, I will stick to the study of certain issues. Neither of t h e mi su n k n o w nt oh i s t o r i o g r a p h yb u t ,i nm yo p i n i o n ,t h e yr e q u i r ea  \nmodern approach in two senses. On the one hand, I refer to the relationship \nbetween fundamental laws and the Constitution a fter the disaster of 1808 \nand, on the other hand, to the origins of the hurdles faced by the codi \ufb01ca-\ntion process both in Spain and in di fferent states in the Americas. Both are \nkey issues for comprehending the origin and nature of the persistence of a \nmaterial understanding of Constitution in the ancient territories of the \nMonarchy once the revolutionary / independence movements covered the \nAmerican space with written Constitutions. Without the history of this persistence, I \ufb01rmly believe that it is not possible to understand the current \ncontroversy on the control of constitutionality of Court Regulations in the Republic of Chile.\nIII. The Starting Point: from Fundamental Laws\nto Hispanic Constitutions.75\nIt is widely known that we owe Ricardo Levene the \ufb01rst delimitation of the \nLaw of the Indies\u2019 history, regardless of the fact that his proposals were not accepted peacefully.\n76Even though I will not attempt to study the history of \nlegal historiography here, I will, in fact, deal with one of its more relevant subject matters:\nthe laws of the Indies. V\u00edctor Tau has warned us against read-\ni n gt h e mw i t hal e g a l i s tv i e w ;77he has recently o ffered a careful description \nof the condition of the legal order of the Indies before the crisis of 1808:\n\u201cThat order was not con\ufb01 ned to the laws issued by the Court. It had to be extracted \nfrom the varied present reality and from the roots of the past. For such purpose, it \nwas necessary to resort to brie \ufb01ngs, to critical and historical writings, to the most \nsigni \ufb01cant legal instruments, to a varied and changing legislation of both royal and \n75 This title belongs to a collective work that has been awarded the Bicentenario de las Cortes \nde C\u00e1diz Prize promoted by Congress of Deputies: L orente /Portillo (2012).\n76 T au(2006) 357\u2013417.\n77 T au(2007).\n206 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enalocal laws that, to a great extent, remained outside the scope of the Recopilaci\u00f3n\n[Compilation], and to the experience described by viceroys in their memoirs, etc. \nThis is the foundation of the Collection, to which he (Benito de la Mata Linares) \nadded the results of his work, his professional experience, throughout his years in \nthe magistracy. \u201d78\nOne of the most relevant features of this legal order was uncertainty, which \nwas part of its own physiology then. However, throughout the \ufb01nal decades \nof the 18th century, it began to be perceived as a true pathology.79In the \nw o r d so fo n eo fi t sm o s t \ufb01erce critics:\n\u201cRoyal laws that expressly abolish civil law maxims are commented and twisted so as \nto reconcile them with the ius commune t ow h i c ht h e ys h o u l dc o n f o r m ,a si ft h e yd i d  \nnot include any new decision. G \u00f3mez and the others, on the basis of the axiom that \nthe abolishment of laws is terrible and must be avoided even against the voices and \nprovisions of law, in order to reconcile them, under the assumption that Roman laws are the genuine ones, will use any \ufb01ction or extravagant meaning to render our \nlaws futile. \u201d\n80\nIt should be noted that criticism had scarce incidence in the forum practice, \nwhich was marked by unmanageable and unstoppable partitioning.81\nD e s p i t es o m ed a t aw h i c hc o u l dp r o v eo t h e r w i s e\u2013 Nueva Planta Decrees, \nthe decline of Councils and the surge of Secretarios del Despacho (Dispatch \nSecretaries), the creation of the Intendencias of the Indies, etc. \u2013 we must not \nbe misled by appearances. Far from adopting a rationale tending to unify the Law, the Monarchy increased the number of corporations in the last decades \nof the 1700s, which entailed the multiplication of jurisdictional spheres and \ntheir con \ufb02icts.\n82In short, uncertainty reached unprecedented levels, so that \nmany called for a legal reform, which, expressed in political terms, could well be translated into a constitutional reform.\nAfter the crisis of 1808, however, some dared to suggest that the\nancient\nAmerican constitution was rooted in the laws of the Indies.83It was Fray \nServando Teresa de Mier who wrote this proposal that has attracted the attention of historians,\n84some of whom are convinced that this clergyman \n78 T au(2011) 163.\n79 M art\u00ednez Marina (1965).\n80 M ora y Jaraba (1748) 218.\n81 S cholz (1981).\n82 M art\u00ednez (2007) 11\u201396.\n83 M ier(1990).\n84 G\u00f3 ngora (2003).\nMore than just Vestiges 207was the last criollo .85But beyond the political weight of Fray Servando\u2019s \nproposal, what remains true is that it was not shared by the most prominent \npolitical personalities of his time, which suggests that the traditional criollo\ndiscourse had fallen into decline.86I have used some thoughts of Teresa de \nMier with the intention of presenting a well-known issue from an American \nstandpoint, an issue that could be formulated as follows: Did the Catholic Monarchy have a Constitution? And, if so, which one was it?\n87\n1. The Monarchy and its constitution(s)\nTo the present day, historians agree that the question about the constitution \nw a sn o tt h ec a u s eb u tt h ec o n s e q u e n c eo ft h ec r i s i so ft h eM o n a r c h y .88This \napproach has further reinforced the long-dated thesis put forth by Halper\u00edn Donghi, which states that the events at the time rather than the willingness of Spanish Americans led to independence in Spanish America.\n89Indeed, it \ncould be summarized that not only independencies, but also Hispanic con-stitutionalism itself, may be considered the legitimate o ffspring of the fall of \nthe Catholic Monarchy. I must clarify that by\nHispanic constitutionalism I \nmean the array of texts that appeared in all the territories of the old Mon-archy since 1811. In short, I believe that despite the endeavors of the advo-cates of history understood as the history of progress \u2013 if there are any le ftat \nthis stage \u2013 the truth is that rather than the French invasion, it was the \nshameful resignations of Bayonne and the Constitution granted /adopted \nthere,\n90that took the then subjects of the Monarchy to wonder whether it \nhad a Constitution.91\nThe mere existence of this question inspired others of greater complexity. \nWith the exception of afrancesados (Francophiles), by 1808 everyone recog-\nnized Ferdinand VII as the legitimate Monarch irrespective of the fact that \nsome began to ask a thorny, long-standing question: How many constitu-tions were there in the Hispanic territories? The history of the Monarchy \n85 A nnino (2008).\n86 B rading (1991); G arriga (2003); G arriga (2006a).\n87 P ortillo (1998).\n88 P ortillo (2008).\n89 D onghi (1985). A similar approach in R odriguez O.

This is exactly what the Marquis of Bajamar \nexpressed in 1785 before the members of the Consejo de Indias he chaired:\n\u201cWe live (\u2026) in a Christian Republic (\u2026) The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, Prelates, \nDignitaries, Town Councils, Priests for Souls, Religions, Monasteries, Prelacies and \nCommunities have been established. They all live in our House: the Sovereign is its \nowner, and as such sets forth disciplinar y and external governance rules in all \nmatters leading to harmony (\u2026). \u201d92\nThe resignations of Bayonne gave rise to an endless discussion on how to \nsubstitute vacatio regis. The volatilization of the physical body of the Monarch \nwas lethal to the ancient corporeal metaphor that had dominated western \npolitical theory for centuries; however, many discursive possibilities remained.\n93The King\u2019s escape did not dissolve the traditional corporative \nstructure of Hispanic society(ies) as if by magic,94so that although the \nCatholic Monarchy had been a Christian Republic, other corporations understood they could claim a similar condition. The miniaturization of \nthe Republic / Monarchy and its embodiment in other republican entities, understood as perfect societies, could not shock anyone given that this notion was one of the chief pillars of the o fficial political culture at the time. \nAs the extremely conservative public law expert Dou y Bassols, who would later sign the Constitution of C\u00e1 diz, stated as late as in 1800:\n\u201cWhat cannot be left unnoticed is that it is not detrimental for the absolutely \nmonarchical constitution of a State to contain democratic and aristocratic entities, \nregarding the powers of the members of such entities, as long as the head of the \nnation is entrusted to the superiority and sovereignty of the King above all. \u201d95\nIt was in this cultural context that the beloved subjects of the Catholic King \nwere faced with the famous question on whether there was a Constitution or not. Just as it had happened a couple of years before in the French kingdom, \nthis type of questioning signaled that a profound shi ftin the legal-political \nparadigm could break with many centuries of history.\n96If the existence of a \n92 B ajamar (1785).\n93 P rimo de Verdad y Ramos (1808).\n94 L emp\u00e9r \u00e8re(2004); R ojas (2007).\n95 D o uyd e Bassols (1974).\n96 F uret /Hal\u00e9vi (1996).\nMore than just Vestiges 209historical constitution was not accepted, then e fforts should be made to dra ft \none or more new constitutions, which threatened to create a new constitu-\ntional cycle. As widely known, both in the U.S. and in France, the Consti-\ntution was no longer considered the resu lt of history: \u201cA constitution is not \nt h ea c to fg o v e r n m e n t ,b u to fap e o p l ec o n s t i t u t i n gag o v e r n m e n t ,a n da  government without a constitution is power without right, \u201d said Thomas Paine (\nThe Rights of Man ( 1 7 9 1 \u2013 9 2 )i nh i sf a m o u sd e b a t ew i t hE d m u n d  \nBurke ( Re\ufb02ections on the Revolution in France , 1790).\nSomething similar took place in the Hispanic world. At \ufb01rst, various \nPeninsular and American public law experts tried to make convincing argu-ments on the existence of countless historical constitutions, whose revital-ization was identi\ufb01ed with the recovery of private liberties that had been \nquashed by centuries of despotism.\n97Nevertheless, the di fferent territories of \nthe Monarchy underwent a relentless process of dra fting written constitu-\ntions. Readers interested in Hispanic legal plurality may imagine that the examples of the Kingdom of Navarra or the Basque provinces must have played an important role in the constitutional construct of the time,\n98which \nis only partly true because the constitutional diversity that emerged a fter \n1808 was not limited to the well-known \u203a foral\u2039 speeches.99Valencian, Cata-\nlan, Majorcan, Aragonese people \u2026 too k advantage of what historians have \ncalled the \u201corphanhood of the Hispanic kingdoms\u201d to claim lost liberties,100\nas rightly stressed by the ultraconservative Borrull in a paper published in \n1810, that is, almost one hundred years a fter the Kingdom of Valencia had \nsuffered the enforcement of its Nueva Planta Decree, which abolished Valen-\ncian law.101\nThe historical constitutional framework that began to be shaped in 1808 \nwas not exclusively peninsular; in fact, the Spanish perspective prevented \ncontextualizing the interpretation of a key time for the entire Hispanic world. The study of the famous\nConsulta al Pa\u00eds [Country Consultation] \nstands out among hundreds of examples that could be used as grounds for this assertion. The leading scholars who analyzed this particular initiative \n97 P eir\u00f3 (1985).\n98 P ortillo (1991); G arcia P\u00e9rez (2008).\n99 B usaall (2005).\n100 H ocquellet (2011).\n101 B orrull y Vilanova (1810).\n210 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enalimited its scope to the Peninsula, and failed to consider the American \nresponses to the Consulta al Pa\u00eds .102At the same time, this stance was shared \nby American historiography, which did not endeavor to study the Spanish American aspect of the\nConsulta al Pa\u00eds e i t h e r .I ns u m m a r y ,f o rd e c a d e s  \nhistoriography either concealed or ignored a series of transcendental writ-ings as responses to the\nConsulta al Pa\u00eds .103Nonetheless, recent research has \nshown that the referred Spanish American responses were incorporated into \nthe Instructions to the representatives appointed to the Junta Central [Cen-\ntral Board],104where the political impulse resulting from the organization of \nthe\ufb01rst elections held on Spanish American soil was consolidated.105In \nother words, too many historians have already incorporated a bi-hemispheric \nperception of the famous Consulta al Pa\u00eds into their research.106\nIn any case, the history of the crisis of the Monarchy and its consequences \nstill requires research not only on discursive uses in the ancient constitu-tion,\n107but also on those questioning its e ffective essence.108No matter how \nhard liberal historiography may strive to prove otherwise,109most of the \ufb01rst \nrepresentatives of the di fferent Hispanic territories \u2013 both in the Junta Cen-\ntraland in the Cortes Generales y Extraordinarias \u2013 shared a material percep-\ntion of what a Constitution was or should be. Thus, the ancient Constitution\ncould be broken down into as many constitutions as territories were repre-sented, and actually all provincial constitutions included both privileges accumulated over the years and new claims, mostly Spanish American, \nnow understood as rights.\n110In fact, there was a novelty, given that these \nrights were based not only on their ancient privileges and / or customs, but \non the geographical and human elements \u2013 topography, climate, fauna, \n102 A rtola (1959); S u\u00e1rez(1982).\n103 Among these instructions there is the Memorial de Agravios [Memorial of Grievances] \ndrafted by Camilo Torres. On this matter, readers may refer to the superb documentary \ncollection published by A lmarza /Garnica (2007).\n104 R ojas (2005).\n105 D emelas -Bohy/Guerra (1993).\n106 R ojas (2008); A lmarza (2010).\n107 G oldman (2007).\n108 C lavero (2000b).\n109 P iqueras (2010).\n110 It is worth recalling that from early times, several petitions for the acknowledgment of the \nrights of the trans-Atlantic provinces reached the Peninsula, G arrido (1993).\nMore than just Vestiges 211\ufb02ora, condition of the inhabitants, etc. \u2013 that had been revealed by the \nscienti\ufb01c explorations made during the last decades of the 1700s.111\nHence, there are wide territories to be discovered by means of research \nshowing what elements of the ancient constitution survived beyond the new \npolitical horizon that opened up a fter 1808. Although we know that the \nHispanic universe set aside the traditional discourse when the written con-stitutions were dra fted, this fact does not shed any light as to how much of \nthe\nhistoric constitution remained in force in the framework created by a \nnew (?) constitutionalism in the ancient territories of the Catholic Mon-archy.\n112\n2. Political historiography, constitutional historiography\nI tw o u l db ep r e s u m p t u o u so fm et oa s s e r tt h a th i s t o r i o g r a p h yh a sn o td e l v e d  \ninto this complex research \ufb01eld.113Moreover, as I have mentioned above, the \ncelebration of the di fferent Bicentennials has not only made available to \nexperts a myriad of sources of potentially unmanageable proportions, but \nit has also contributed to center much of the debate on independence on \nconstitutional matters.114Thus, legal historians might become the main \nplayers of a debate that does not only a ffect the knowledge of our past, \nbut also the understanding of our present.\nHowever, I believe the following diagnosis is not an overstatement: \nalthough non-legal historiography has experienced great changes in recent decades, this has not been the case of legal historiography. At present, polit-ical history holds the predominant place that economic history held for years. Led by recognized authors such as Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Guerra,\n115this \nnew political historiography has adopted two di fferent stances, namely: It \neither calls for the specialized knowledge of legal historians,116or directly \ncompetes with it, insofar as it puts forward new values without resorting to arguments stemming from legal history, be it traditional or modern.\n117Even \n111 P imentel (1998).\n112 B ellingeri (1993).\n113 C hiaramonte (2010).\n114 G uti\u00e9rrez (2010); C alder \u00f3n(2010).\n115 G uerra (1992).\n116 A nnino (2010).\n117 R odriguez O. (2005).\n212 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enathough the basic sources for the study of the period are of a constitutional \nnature and, accordingly, chie \ufb02y legal, the value of a legal historian\u2019s knowl-\nedge in the historiographical \ufb01eld is far from guaranteed. The present state \nof affairs suggests that a wide gap, caused by a special type of deafness, is \ndividing historians. In my opinion, the main consequence of this situation is that the interpretation of similar sources (minutes of Town Councils or Assemblies, constitutional regulations, documents on elections, court re-\ncords, and the like) has become endlessly multiplied and increasingly contra-\ndictory.\n118\nIn this state of a ffairs, I believe it can be stated that if a new horizon for \ncolonial law history exists, it will need to face a three-fold challenge. In the \n\ufb01rst place, legal historiography must set aside any nationalist conceit. We \nmight not understand the process that started in 1808 in unitary terms, \nwhich means peninsular or American. Nor can we a ffirm that the \ufb01rst \nmanifestations of written constitutionalism were Spanish, Ecuadorian, Colombian or, Argentine, because none of this political entities existed at that time. Accordingly, the origin of national laws (\nderecho patrio ) cannot be \nrooted in any of these constitutions, irrespective of the fact that the institu-tions which started dra fting these new texts and establishing new political \nand institutional practices were not those of the peaceful (?) times of the Catholic Monarchy. In the second place, legal historiography must attempt to explain how terms such as law / legislation, government, justice, represen-\ntation, responsibility, and so on must be interpreted within their context and \nnot in isolation, ultimately deprived of legal background. If not, our com-prehension of the past will be irreparably distorted by virtue of the projec-tion of present categories. Curiously, the foregoing is a\ndefect mostly found in \nthe writings of non-jurist historians, who frequently appear to lack sensitiv-ity regarding the localization of continuities / discontinuities in the language of the law. Lastly, legal historiography must undertake the di fficult task of \nde\ufb01ning the foundations of legal modernity. Within this task, however, the \nexisting di fficulties do not stem that much from misunderstandings arising \nin discussions with other historians but from its own core. The plain truth is that many legal historians have accepted, somewhat uncritically, the methodological options advocated by jurist-historians, who usually pretend to make a genealogy of their own knowledge. Admittedly, this state of a ffairs \n118 \u00c1 lvarez Junco /Luz\u00f3n(2006).\nMore than just Vestiges 213has changed considerably in recent times, though not enough so as to main-\ntain that Spanish and American legal historiography have completely rid \nthemselves of the burden of the past, let alone to certify that a new legal \nhistory of constitutional modernity has managed to introduce new historio-graphical conventions beyond the very limited scope of the discipline.\n119\nThis brief outline of the history of historiography is aimed at giving \nc o n t e x tt oah i s t o r i o g r a p h i c a la r g u m e n tt h a tb r o k eo u ta g a i n s tt h eb a c k d r o p  \nof the celebration of the Bicentennials. Focused on the con \ufb02ict between the \nancient and the new constitutions, and deeply marked by arti \ufb01cial territorial \ndeterminations, the argument was provoked by the existence of two con-\ntradictory versions of the history of the Monarchy crisis. While the \ufb01rst \nv e r s i o nd e s c r i b e st h ec o n s e q u e n c e so ft h ec r i s i sa sar u p t u r e ,t h es e c o n d  \nversion attempts to stress that the continuity of ancient institutional devices \nand understandings reduced considerably the modern components of new \npolitical ideas. This serves to answer not only the usual question of how revolutionary the Hispanic revolutions really were,\n120but also another ques-\ntion that concerns legal historians to a large extent, namely: How inclined to \nstatism were those determined to build new worlds? It must be noted that \nthe term \u201cstatism\u201d unconsciously refers us to other terms such as \u201cunity, \u201d \u201cgenerality, \u201d \u201cterritoriality, \u201d \u201chierarchy, \u201d etc. In sum, it refers us to all the elements that make up the photographic negative of a society structured in corporative terms and a political power expressed in jurisdictional \nterms.\n121\n3. By way of conclusion: an interpretative proposal\nAt this point, I will outline the key elements of my proposal, but before I do \nso, I must admit that they have changed throughout the years. At \ufb01rst, I was \nlured by the most radical discourses, id est , those that understood Hispanic \nconstitutional power or powers as a departure from the ancient discourse of the corporative Monarchy. However, I later understood that the dra fting of \nwritten constitutions did not imply a transformation as radical as usually contended.\n119 L orente (2004).\n120 D iMeglio (2008).\n121 L emp\u00e9ri \u00e8re(2003).\n214 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enaIn my opinion, the \ufb01rst Hispanic constitutions shared a common ele-\nment: all of them gave constitutional validity to a panoply of ancient conceptions \nand old institutional mechanisms . This meant that large segments of the \nancient legal order of the Monarchy were given constitutional hierarchy in \ntheir Peninsular and Spanish American versions.122I do not mean that there \nwas nothing new under the sun; quite the contrary, Hispanic constitution-alism could not better itself in some aspects considered essential for the \nestablishment of a new constitutional order in other regions. Thus, for in-\nstance, the new legal devices, purportedly born from the inclusion of the principle of separation of powers in all constitutional writings, did not undergo major practical reforms on either side of the Atlantic.\n123Something \nsimilar holds true for the \u201crevolution of voting, \u201d124since although historiog-\nraphy has highlighted how swi ftly the Hispanic world adopted new electoral \npractices, it has also stressed that accepting the multiplication of electoral ranks\n125reinforced the corporative nature of the Hispanic institutional fab-\nric.126\nIn a nutshell, if it is assumed that the \ufb01rst Hispanic constitutionalism \nvoluntarily incorporated a series of elements from the ancient state of a ffairs, \nthe so-called vestiges or remnants can easily be considered components of the new legal orders that gradually developed both in the Peninsula and in the Americas a fter the fall of the Catholic Monarchy. There is little doubt \nthat the number of such elements was large, although it is worth focusing on \none of them in particular because it is closely related with colonial law \nvestiges, namely: the establishment within the Hispanic sphere of a new notion of law and, consequently, of Code.\nIV . From Casuistry to System\nV\u00edctor Tau has oft en stated that one of the most fruitful \ufb01elds for the history \nof the Law of the Indies is the one that emerged a fter American independ-\nence. Because the interpretations on derecho de transici\u00f3n (Law of Transition) \n122 G arriga /Lorente (2007); L orente (2010).\n123 M art\u00ednez (1999).\n124 T ernavasio (2002); P aniagua (2003).\n125 M u\u00f1oz de Bustillo (1998).\n126 A nnino (1995).\nMore than just Vestiges 215are so numerous, it is impossible to o ffer a list of relevant works here.127\nNonetheless, I believe the approach that both Peninsular and Spanish Amer-\nican legal historiography share in general is not wholly convincing when \nplacing into perspective the complex background of this Law of Transition. Even at the risk of o ffering unfair criticism, I will outline what I have come \nto consider insu fficiencies. The \ufb01rst one is clearly evident: For decades, the \nhistory of 19th-century law has too o ften been identi \ufb01ed with the history of \ncodi\ufb01cation; thus, documents such as government directions, private initia-\ntives, dra fting of projects, other foreign documents, parliamentary proceed-\nings, comments on new collections, etc. have made up the basic material of the history of Codi \ufb01cation, which has also been governed by the binomial \nlegal modernization = Codes. Scholars have agreed that both Peninsular and \nSpanish American legal scenarios were dominated by slow Codi \ufb01cation for \nmany decades, which means that despite political breakup, legal issues \nremained very similar on both sides of the Atlantic.\nSo why do I assert that this strategy is insu fficient? Simply because rather \nthan interpreting, it merely describes a known fact, which, in turn, can only \nbe appreciated when contrasting it with the example o ffered by Napoleonic \nFrance. However, if we listen to some contemporaries, the problem did not \nreside in the inability to dra fttexts but in transforming a political and \njuridical culture. By way of example:\n\u201cWill our laws be observed hereina fter just because we say so? If nothing is missing \nin our constitution, how come they have been so neglected? (\u2026) What purpose does \nit serve for the people that the nation established in its general Congresses that the \nKings would abide by them, and that they would undertake this as a sacred obli-\ngation (\u2026)? Have we unfortunately not always seen them do precisely the oppo-\nsite?\u201d128\nFl\u00f3rez Estrada\u2019s fears were well-grounded. It was not by chance that the \nforefathers of the early Hispanic constitutionalism gave constitutional hier-\narchy to the legacy composed of documents and practices that only pro-longed that\ncasuistic manner of determining and managing the legal order \nbeyond the crisis of the Catholic Monarchy. Thus, the early Hispanic con-\nstitutionalism did not only favor the reproduction of a crepuscular ius com-\nmune , but also supported it so that its domination of the di fferent Spanish \n127 Some of them are excellent: G onz\u00e1lez(1988).\n128 F l\u00f3rezEstrada (1810) 5.\n216 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enaAmerican and Peninsular scenarios continued throughout much of the \n1800s. It was at the core of this constitutionalism that the \ufb01rst hurdle \nappeared for the establishment of general legislation on both sides of the Atlantic. Let\u2019s analyze this:\n1. \u201cTaking constitutions seriously\u201d\nThe foregoing argument only makes sense if the history of codi \ufb01cation is \nassumed to be part of the history of constitutionalism, which, even if it may \nappear evident at \ufb01rst, has not had a relevant place in Spanish historiography. \nIn my country, it has been possible to study the history of codi \ufb01ed texts \nwithout aligning it to constitutional history, so that the chronology of the \nlegal history of the 1800s and 1900s has been almost exclusively marked by \ndifferent codi\ufb01cation landmarks. This kind of understanding of our most \nrecent past has practically disappeared at the heart of modern legal histor-iography, but it still causes severe damage in the work of many jurists inter-ested in fashioning the history of their own disciplinary \ufb01elds.\nI suggest that the history of Codi \ufb01cation needs to \ufb01nally assimilate Tar-\nello\u2019s old proposal, which, as widely known, did not distinguish Constitu-tions from Codes. In historiographical terms, this long-standing proposal entails the permanent eradication of a dichotomy that for decades has been expressed as follows: Given that Constitutions contained vague political \nstatements deprived of legal value, the true law was embodied in the Codes, \nwhich, at the same time, abrogated the ancient casuistic culture that had prevailed in the Christian Western world for centuries. I must stress that if these conceptions are maintained, legal historiography is likely to remain in \nthe same place it was, that is, preserving the history of the Constitution as an \nexclusive \ufb01eld of research for constitutionalists, political scientists and his-\ntorians of ideas. It is worth mentioning that I have nothing against their work; my criticism is only aimed at the traditional absence of legal histor-iography in the area denoted by the history of new Constitutions.\nThus, I believe that there is a \ufb01rst link between Codes and Constitutions \nthat cannot be ignored; it simply requir es a close reading of Constitutions. \nThis proposal can be explained as follows: Besides analyzing the main state-ments contained in Constitutions, it is necessary to do the same with their small print. Here is an example to illustrate this idea: Several historians have \ncommented on the famous declaration of the Cadiz Constitution, and have \nMore than just Vestiges 217identi\ufb01ed it with the clearest precedent of the policy for the uni \ufb01cation of \nlaw: \u201cThe Civil, Criminal and Commercial Codes shall be the same for the \nentire Monarchy, without prejudice to variations that the Courts may intro-\nduce under speci \ufb01c circumstances\u201d (Section 258). The truth is that the inten-\ntion of the Cortes Generales y Extraordinarias (Constituent Assembly) to unify \nthe law is undeniable; nonetheless, historians tend to forget to relate to the \ufb01rst paragraph of the Section with the second one, although it contains a \nprovision pointing out that the delegates to the Constitutional Conventions \nof Cadiz were aware of the diversity of territories and peoples.\n129What the \nCadiz Constitution de \ufb01ned as \u201cspeci \ufb01c circumstances\u201d looks familiar to \nthose who study the history of colonial law, which for centuries tried to adjust to very di fferent circumstances by using a series of speci \ufb01cm e c h a -\nnisms, among which the recognized\nobey but do not comply stands out.\nAnyway, since the vehemence of the Code did not resist any peculiarities, \nit was necessary to design instruments to enforce it.130Without them, the \nidea of a Code, rather than the Code itself, resulted in a dead-end idea, or, otherwise, maintained the limitations already in place during the 1700s in \nthe Hispanic world.\n131Being autonomous, such instruments were deter-\nmined by a familiar premise: the maintenance of the regulatory legacy of \nthe Catholic Monarchy on both sides of the Atlantic. As was the case with the Cadiz Constitution, almost all Hispanic constitutions included two rather contradictory ideas. On the one hand, they committed to renew the \nregulatory order and, on the other, they deemed that the ancient order \nshould remain in force until those commitments were made e ffective. His-\npanic constitutionalism, which at the outset had been legitimized here and there with the purported recovery of monarchic laws, \ufb01nally understood that \nall of them \u2013 king, kingdoms, local corporations, various jurisdictions, etc. \u2013 continued to coexist under the new constitutional order as long as they did not con \ufb02ict with it. It shall su ffice to recall that the insurgent Constitution of \nApatzing \u00e1n had to acknowledge that \u201c(\u2026) as the Sovereignty of the Nation \nadopts the set of laws that shall replace the ancient laws, these shall remain \nin full force and e ffect, except those repealed herein and in other decrees\u201d \n129 C lavero (2000a).\n130 C aroni (1996).\n131 C lavero (1978a); C lavero (1978b): Clavero (1982).\n218 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1ena(Section 211). In other terms, the \ufb01rst Hispanic constitutionalism was one of \nthe causes \u2013 if not the \ufb01rst \u2013 for the maintenance of the casuistic rationale \nthat for centuries had managed the legal order of the Catholic Monarchy.\n2. The force of casuistry and the di fficulties of the system\nOn both sides of the Atlantic, formalizing the constitutions of the regulatory \nlegacy of the Catholic Monarchy brought about a series of eff ects, among \nwhich the accumulation of regulations stands out. Thus, it can well be \naffirmed that the system continued to be threatened by casuistry for decades. \nIt may seem that the accumulation of regulations is a mere technicality just for the use of legal experts; however, repeals directly a ffected a new way of \nconceiving political power, which determined the design of instruments needed to exercise it. Once all Hispanic constitutions had adopted the ancient legacy, they must have undoubtedly pondered this question: in the face of so many texts, from di fferent times and contradicting one other, who \ndecided what law was and how was this done?\nThe combination of two antithetical notions on how to identify legisla-\ntion opened the door to a series of widely known issues that dominated the legal scenario in the Hispanic world throughout the 1800s. Firstly, the long-standing idea that law was not exclusively legislation passed by the assembly, but also the ancient privileges and, of course, the opinions of jurists re-\nmained.\n132Secondly, the absence of determination of the regulatory order \nprevented the establishment of a \u201cnormative typology\u201d arranged according \nto a hierarchical order. Given that a law, order, regulation, ordinance \u2026 were absolutely interchangeable, the rules adopted by Parliament could \nnot prevail over those issued by the other branches of government, which \nretained a signi \ufb01cant normative power. Thirdly, the absence of determina-\ntion of the regulatory order ensured a wide margin of activity to anyone considered a \u201cjudge\u201d , whether legal experts or laymen. In this respect, we should not be surprised by the great di fficulties faced by those committed to \nimplementing mechanisms for the defense of law, such as the establishment of the duty of judges to provide grounds for their judgments, or the estab-lishment of appeals to Courts of Cassation. However, both measures had \n132 L orente (2011).\nMore than just Vestiges 219been adopted in France in 1790, that is, a year before the National Assembly \napproved the \ufb01rst French Constitution.133\nThe \ufb01rst Hispanic constitutionalism created an overwhelming and inde-\nterminate collection of texts and interpretations thereof that did not only coexist with ancient regulatory bodies, but also determined the relationship between the legislative, executive and judicial branches, since it forced the reformulation of a set of ancient practices. This had dire consequences inso-\nfar as it hindered the uni \ufb01cation of the law. Many years a fter the independ-\nence movements, Andr\u00e9s Bello described some of them:\n\u201cFor this reform to be truly useful, it must be radical. In no other part of the social \norder we inherited from Spain is the axe so necessary. As regards political reforms, \nwe are not inclined to dismantling everything; but our trial system merits its total \nremoval and substitution for another. Maybe, it would not be an exaggeration to \naffirm that this system lacks all guarantees embraced by experience to limit arbi-\ntrariness and protect the Law. What sometimes makes us wary of their presence is the concern that exists against some of them, even within the respectable class of \nmagistrates and legal experts. For instance, almost no one recognizes the advantages of having judges and courts ground their decisions, a practice in line with the \nprinciple of general responsibility that it is the soul of a republic, or, rather, of \nany government. In a country where the executive branch cannot make a decision, \nunless pursuant to a law and by invoking it, on the smallest investment of public \nmonies, can a court have the power to adjudicate disputed property that may be \nworth hundreds of thousands of pesos without stating pursuant to what law or \nprinciple the adjudication has been made, or without explaining why one of the titles invoked must prevail over the other? This seems outrageous. \u201d\n134\nThe new law, allegedly consisting only of the rules adopted by legislative \nbodies or of exceptional rules issued by executive bodies, continued to be interpreted from the standpoint of\nforensic practices, which understood that \ntheir main objective was to establish \u201cconcordances\u201d among normative texts to display the justice in the regulations. Blatantly and brie \ufb02yp u t :B \u00e1rtolo \nmay not have been mentioned any longer in the peninsular forum,\n135but \nt h ea d v i c eo fG \u00f3mez y Negro \u2013 whose Elementos de pr\u00e1ctica forense [Elements \nof Forensic Practice] originally published in 1806, was re-published on several \noccasions with its corresponding forms136\u2013 would be adopted.

Continuity prevailed in an editorial market almost \nentirely dominated by the presence of works written mostly before 1808, which were criticized, corrected, enlarged, or updated by a succession of authors throughout the never-ending 1800s.\n137The best example that shows \nthe success of this particular technique is the well-known Librer\u00eda de escriba-\nnos [Library of Notaries] by Joseph Febrero, published in 1769, which was re-\nused, or rather (re-)ordered, commented, annotated, etc. not only by various Spanish authors,\n138but also by some important Spanish American ones,139\nwho for decades replicated the same technique on the other side of the Atlantic.\n140Laura Beck has stressed that the \u201ccurse\u201d against this type of \nliterature uttered by Savigny and developed by the Historical School, also necessary for the process of structuring the canon of history of legal liter-ature, has created a dramatic gap between historiography and its own sour-ces; in fact, this does not allow us to assess the constituent value such literature had for legal thinking in the Hispanic world of the 19th cen-\ntury.\n141As Beck has asserted, \u201cwhile kings and queens came and le ft, minis-\nters and governments fell, Vinnius, Heineccius and Sala remained unmoved \nfrom their 19th-century lawyers\u2019 o ffices\u201d .142Brie\ufb02y, it may be stated that the \n19th-century legal-political class nurtu red a cult for totally hypocritical legal-\nity on both sides of the Atlantic.\nIn the 19th-century newly formed states, both the Code and its culture \nwere ignored,143which was meant to reformulate and assimilate a new \nconception of the principle of legality, taking steps for its implementa-tion.\n144The inexistence of the foregoing enabled the literature of the well-\nknown concordancias (concordances) between Roman Law and the new \nSpanish, Mexican or Chilean Laws to continue determining the mindset of jurists and informing the practice of judges and courts. This failed to \n137 T orres Campos (1897).\n138 Rese\u00f1a cr\u00edtica (1852).\n139 P ascua (1834\u20131835).\n140 G onz\u00e1lez(1998).\n141 B eckVarela (2008).\n142 B eckVarela (2008) 193.\n143 P etit (1995); Petit (1996).\n144 L orente (2001).\nMore than just Vestiges 221contribute to expedite the emergence of a new concept of general law that \nthreatened to depart, once and for all, f rom the ancient casuistic culture of \nius commune.\nV. C o n c l u s i o n s\nWhat is the value of history? There are few professional historians who have \nnot asked themselves this question during their life. As is widely known, the \nanswers cover the shelves of well-stocked libraries, so readers need not fear that I expand on this matter. However, I would like to recall some thoughts of Tom \u00e1s y Valiente, who once asserted: \u201clegal historians play a signi \ufb01cant \nrole: to contribute their legal experience of the past for the understanding \nand improvement of our present world. \u201d\n145Tom \u00e1syV a l i e n t e ,a sm a n y  \nothers, was concerned with the relation between historical times,146but \nhe simpli \ufb01ed the matter by a ffirming that if history has a purpose, such \npurpose is to understand the present (\u201canyone who does not make this \nuse of history will write dead books\u201d).147\nTo this day, I am not quite certain whether some of the objectives of legal \nhistory in general, or of colonial law history in particular, are similar to those in the works of Francisco Tom \u00e1s y Valiente. My intention has been to follow \nhis advice in this contribution as a tribute to V\u00edctor Tau, in an attempt to relate current issues with the historiographical treatment of what can be \nconsidered their\norigins. In my opinion, the former comes not only from a \ntradition that started at the time of the Conquest, which served to extend the \nimprint of European legal culture in the Americas, but from the inclusion of many old notions in the new (?) legal systems following the independencies. \nNonetheless, the treatment of this issue may eventually end as the content of \nd e a db o o k si fi ti sn o tr e l a t e dt oaf u r t h e rq u e s t i o nIc o n s i d e re s s e n t i a l :W h y  did the Hispanic world o ffer so much resistance to the state-building process \nthat dominated the Western world throughout the 19th century? I am aware that before answering this question, its own hypothetical nature may be \nchallenged. Yet, I believe that the Chilean debate over the legitimation of \nthe existence and scope of Court Regulations issued by courts can only be \n145 T om\u00e1syValiente (1997b) 4773.\n146 K oselleck (1993).\n147 T om\u00e1syValiente (1997c) 5062.\n222 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enaexplained if we accept that the weakness of general legislation was a key \nfeature of the Spanish and American nations.\nThis weakness might be veri \ufb01ed through the analysis of 19th-century legal \npractices, which were really old. The creation of laws remained encased in ancient formalities; petitions or claims against the unfairness of ancient laws that once paralyzed their enforcement i n the entire Hispanic sphere contin-\nu e dt ob ei nf o r c ea n dp r o v e dt ob ee ffective as well. At the same time, \ncourts, as well as civil and military administrators, continued to enjoy free-dom to determine what should be used in court or executed in each case. A crucial question must be added to the foregoing: Against this backdrop, where the\nimpossible assimilation of a formal concept of law prevailed, who was \nactually in charge of executing the law ? It is in this regard that another excep-\ntion becomes evident: Hispanic constitutionalism preferred to create corpo-rate, non-hierarchical institutions. In brief, individualism had no room in \nSpanish-American legal culture.\nThe adventure that began in 1808 with the separation of powers ended \nalmost where it had begun, since general legislation continued to face sim-\nilar obstacles for many decades both in Spain and in the di fferent American \nnations. At this stage, several questions may be posed: When was an end put \nnot so much to the vestiges of the legal order of the Monarchy but to its structuring nature of the new 19th-century orders in both hemispheres? Was there enough room within the new legal orders for outstanding metamor-\nphoses, as was the case of the renowned Mexican\namparo ? Finally, I am \nconvinced that the comparative study of Transition Law is a real challenge \nfor legal historiography. It may well be included in the list of appealing issues for the development of New Horizons for the study of Colonial \nLaw, which,\ninter alia , may explain the causes for the high standing that \nCourt Regulations still enjoy in the Republic of Chile.\nMore than just Vestiges 223Bibliography\nAg\u00fcero ,Alejandro (2007), Las categor\u00edas b \u00e1s i c a sd el ac u l t u r aj u r i s d i c c i o n a l ,i n :  \nLorente ,Marta ( c o o r d . ) ,D ej u s t i c i ad ej u e c e saj u s t i c i ad el e y e s .H a c i al a  \nEspa\u00f1a de 1870, Madrid, 20\u201358\nAg\u00fcero ,Alejandro (2010), La justicia penal en tiempos de transici \u00f3n.

The Established Point of View and the New Approach\nThe historical study of local and provincial derecho indiano examined across a \nregional situation peripheral to the Spanish monarchy pertains to the dis-\nciplinary \ufb01eld of legal history and is socio-legally oriented. It extends to any \nexperience or knowledge related to the legal phenomenon. Therefore, inter-est lies not only in the normative and doctrinal system, but also in the set of habits of mind and style that encompasses both the actions of legal operators \nand the expressions found in daily practice due to the action and behavior of \ndifferent social groups. Socio-legal experiences should be incorporated with-\nin the framework of what may be termed local legal culture.\nMost legal historiographical studies on the\nderecho indiano have rested on \nthe assumption that power was established or that law was created at the \nupper and central levels of a consolidated order. The image of a unitary \nderecho indiano imposed from the Peninsula, which was perceived to have \none general normative power, was accepted by an ample section of the \nAmerican historiography and spread through cultural spheres. This image \nmet the aspirations of the Enlightenment and, later, those of the liberal \npolitical theory of the 19th century, according to which power resided in the State as the central body bringing together other institutions and law was general and uniform. Most histori ans and jurists read and interpreted \nancient texts as well as historical events under this paradigm, and hence \nreaffirmed that model.\nThis was the approach that prevailed during most of the 20th century. \nHistorians applied the contemporary state model when studying the past, \nwhich implied viewing the law as a normative system created by its exclusive legislative power, evidenced mainly by uniform and complete bodies of law \nupon which a dogmatic legal system was constructed. From this perspective, \nProvincial and Local Law of the Indies 235thederecho indiano was recreated as a legal system established by the central \nbodies of the monarchy which culminated in the Recopilaci\u00f3n de Leyes de \nIndias of 1680 [Compilation of the Laws of the Indies], a compilation of the \nentire body of basic law to be applied in the Americas. Underneath this \ncompiling normative system, a particular, changing and casuistic local or \u201ccreole\u201d law was hidden. It was issued by the authorities residing in the Indies by virtue of the power delegated to them by the Metropolis, and it \nwas subject to the mechanism of royal assent.\nThe most salient academic writings of the mid-20th century traditional \nlegal historiography of the Indies have always re \ufb02ected awareness that the \nlegal complexity of the Indies was not circumscribed to dogmatic forms. \nHence, early experts - Rafael Altamira and Ricardo Levene, and more mod-\nern ones Alfonso Garc\u00eda Gallo, Ricardo Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa, Jos\u00e9 M. Mariluz \nUrquijo and Ismael S\u00e1nchez Bella - perceived such interest in studying the local legislation, and even set it as a future research goal, signaling some of the most valuable sources for the task. However, local rules that they iden-ti\ufb01ed were regarded as merely supplementary and of lesser relevance.\nThis view started to change gradually and decisively as the initiative to \nrevise those paradigms was set in motion in the last decades of the century. New historiographical approaches emerged, some placing high value on the political-legal autonomy of the peripheral regions from the central power (Antonio M. Hespanha). Consequently, the centralized and uniform con-\nception of the derecho indiano started to weaken while an image of multi-\nplicity started to gain strength. It stemmed from the diverse geographical and human realities bundled in the Americas, which obviously could not be re\ufb02ected in a uniform legal body. Cities began to assume a major role in the \ncreation and application of a system of their own (Bartolom\u00e9 Clavero). On the basis of variety and Spanish American casuistry, it was necessary to attend to the realities and interplay of a multiplicity of jurisdictional and normative powers that contributed to the development of a peculiar and local provin-cial system.\nThus began to open a new path of theoretical studies and \ufb01eldwork, in \nwhich local law was neither merely supplementary nor limited to an isolated area of the\nderecho indiano : rather is has adquired a level of importance \nundreamt-of before, to the extent that it has come to o ffer a novel approach \nto study the whole legal system in force in Spanish American. Furthermore, \nin this approach this local law is a core element in the continuity of the legal \n236 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguiculture of the Indies a fter the emancipation, during the so-called period of \nderecho patrio or national law of Spanish American countries, until the time \nof codi \ufb01cation.\nAided by the new theories of recent times and the decline of the former \npolitical paradigm, other images are emerging nowadays that depict a multi-\nple and boundless derecho indiano born in di ffe r e n tp l a c e so ft h eN e wW o r l d ,  \nrespondent to the diverse geographical and human realities bundled in the \nvast continent, and which make it possible to recognize the existence of \ndiverse local and provincial normative systems.\nA new approach (based upon Antonio M. Hespanha\u2019s model criterion) \nposits as a hypothesis the inversion of those terms, addressing the possibility that local areas might be genuine sources of power and creation of law. This \ninescapably leads to the reconsideration of old assumptions and to the awak-\nening of brand-new ideas about the \u2018center-periphery\u2019 axis and the existence of multiple jurisdictional and normative powers which sometimes work simultaneously at di fferent levels (Tamar Herzog). This encourages the com-\nparison of the mechanisms operating in diff erent local contexts. This oper-\nation highlights the structure and dynamics of this vast political entity, as well as the nature of the di fferent laws (socio-legal systems) that were present \nin it, with diverse margins of autonomous expression and centralized impo-sition according to time and circumstances.\nThe\nlocal legal phenomenon arises as a new instrument to learn more about \nthederecho indiano and, in a broader sense, to deeply understand the mech-\nanisms of articulation in that political entity of great territorial dimensions: the Hispanic monarchy of Spain and the Indies during the Modern Age. Despite the considerable historical-political and historical-legal bibliography \non the topic, some issues and questions remain unanswered. These are real \nlegal historiographical problems that call for new light to be shed in order to reach a satisfactory and comprehensive understanding of both its structure and historical development throughout the three long centuries of its exis-tence. In this sense, the approach suggested approach here may contribute to \na deeper understanding.\nThe speci \ufb01c framework of this approach is limited to a particular space \nand time: the provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata, Tucum\u00e1n and Cuyo from the \n16th to the 18th centuries. During this p eriod, the foregoing provinces were \nviewed as peripheral to the centers of political power \u2013 Madrid, Lima and \nCharcas \u2013 until the creation of the Viceroyalty in 1776, when their status was \nProvincial and Local Law of the Indies 237put on a par with that of other peripheral regions of higher rank within the \nmonarchy.\nThe matter will be addressed in key areas or subjects of that local law. This \napproach will help revise, adjust and modify, if applicable, the conceptual framework. It will also pave the way for future research in other areas, and for a deeper and more comprehensive an alysis of the areas considered here, \nso that local law will progressively achieve scienti \ufb01c consistency.\nII.

On the contrary, it is essential that we understand that \nderecho indiano was still in force far beyond political emancipation, and that \nwhile its structure had general characteristics perceivable across the whole Indies, speci \ufb01c regional and local varieties emerged that were the result of \ndifferent geographical, social and economic realities. In other words, it has \nc o m et h et i m et oc o n s i d e ro u t d a t e dt h e s e old historiographical tendencies, \nunder which the study of the\nderecho indiano was limited to its normative \nsystem and questions almost exclusively related to legal creation by an almighty political authority residing in the metropolis. This retrospective \nview now gives way to the image of a more \ufb02exible and multiple\nderecho \nindiano , which emerged from a diversity of geographical and human real-\nities. Hence, it is convenient to limit the scope of the research program to a \nparticular geographical area, without precluding its broader placement with-\nin the legal culture of the Indies and its focus on comparative history across \ndifferent regions.\nT h ec e n t r a lp r e m i s ec o n s i s t si np l a c i n gf o c u so na na r e aw h i c h ,c o n c e i v e d  \nas a natural formation, served as a setting for the display, on various levels and by a multiplicity of peripheral powers \u2013 o ften difficult to identify \u2013 of \ngenuine legal autonomy. Such a situation would be a result of a multi-layered combination of mechanisms of action and the simultaneous resist-ance to royal authority, which was indi fferent to being placed within canons \nderived from rationalistic hierarchical conceptions. Its constant display sug-\ngests that those in charge of the administration of provincial and local law, \nrather than mere recipients of graciously delegated power, acted as real \n238 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguiguardians of alternative authority. This image undermines the credibility of \nthe classic reductionist views, under which the monarchy would appear as \nthe sole power vested with legitimate authority to make laws.\nThe areas to be studied in particular must be carefully selected taking into \nconsideration the nature of the topic, its local roots, and the availability of \nexperts in the \ufb01eld recognized for their previous knowledge of the subject, \nwho might allow the conclusions of their research to be integrated to the \ncommon project.\nIn order to advance in the knowledge of this provincial and local law, six \nkey study topics have been set as speci \ufb01c objectives. The goal is to detect \nelements in them through which local features can be veri \ufb01ed and analyzed. \nThese topics are: (1) the political condition in the city and the province; (2) the local normative fabric; (3) jurisdictional culture and justice; (4) family \nand household order; (5) the concept of property and the exploitation of natural resources; and (6) the relation between the universal and the partic-ular in canon law. Some of these topics are now being examined in a number of research projects, whose \ufb01ndings reveal the value of delving into \nthe material and disseminating the analysis so that new elements shaping the local legal culture begin to emerge.\n1. The political condition in the city and the province\nThe root of the local system lay in the city \u2013 city meaning \u201crepublic\u201d and \n\u201ccorporation\u201d \u2013 with its own entity and exclusive law. Both the urban region and the contiguous rural area were under its jurisdiction. Among the con-stituents of the population center, houses and families, convents and mon-\nasteries, unions and associations, schools, universities and consulates stood \nout at the lower level, each with their rules and regulations, bene \ufb01ts and \nexemptions, customs and traditions, chiefs, prelates and governors. When Castillo de Bovadilla stated that \u201chouses are small cities and cities are big houses, \u201d he was picturing the basic layers constituting that local system. The \npolitical, economic, and judicial authority was vested in the\nCabildo and the \nroyal official, which acted as guardians of corporations and people. Their \nnormative activity extended mainly o ver the public sphere, more or less \nintensely depending on time and place.\nWorking from more general layouts of the political condition (R. Zorra-\nqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa), texts and testimonies depicting characteristic situations can be \nProvincial and Local Law of the Indies 239gathered that may help re\ufb01n et h ew a yt h ei s s u ei sa d d r e s s e da n dv e r i f y  \nwhether or not there is a correspondence with those layouts, and to what \nan extent they should be modi \ufb01ed or nuanced.\nMost importantly, this process will go hand in hand with new historio-\ngraphical approaches that, without ignoring the existence of a strong ten-\ndency towards centralization and uniformity during those centuries, regard the Spanish monarchy as a balanced, complex order, whose powers were \nspread among recognized centers of authority and their peripheries, and \nwhere the monarch played a preeminent yet not dominant role. This new view seems to be in better accordance with the analysis of a reality where the vastness, variety, and speci \ufb01city of its elements, together with the distance \nthat lay between the provinces and the Crown, precluded the everyday \nexercise of government from the Peninsula.\nThis new approach leads us to consider di fferent mechanisms of power, \nfrom the one present in clientelism an d corporatism to that produced by \nbureaucracy itself, all this intertwined by subtle links that changed depend-\ning on the circumstances. It is thus more proper to talk about a horizontal, \nrather than a vertical, order in the conception of power, and recognize the \nexistence of \ufb01elds of action reserved to each sphere of power.\nThis can be veri \ufb01ed by the relation between the local authorities in the \nprovinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata and Tucum\u00e1n with the king and the Pen-insular bodies. As I have observed while studying the consultations of the \nConsejo de Indias [Council of the Indies], the C\u00e1mara [Chamber of the \nIndies] and the Junta de Guerra [Board of War] during the 17th century, \nthe matters they addressed revolved around the following: appointment of royal and ecclesiastical offi cers, concession of grants and graces, treatment \nand evangelization of native people, leaves of absence for travel, foreign trade control, and defense and forti \ufb01cation of the territory. A strong inter-\nvention in judicial a ffairs can also be observed, when serious cases of vio-\nlence, abuse or excess of power by magistrates and governors were reported. The practical exercise of authority by the monarch can thus be limited to \ncertain areas and situations, and it becomes selective and eminent. The \nremaining power is distributed between the Spanish American centers and peripheries (Lima, Charcas, Santiago de Chile for Cuyo, etc.). The city wields considerable normative and jurisdictional power.\nA description of what fell under the charge of the\nCabildo is recorded in a \nBuenos Aires council minute of the year 1674, during the course of a power \n240 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguidispute. The passage is very suggestive and requires an extensive study, impos-\nsible to carry out in this paper for reasons of space. Its \ufb01rst part reads: \n\u201cCabildos (\u2026), under their royal laws and ius commune , are vested with the \npower to rule the city and hear matters pertaining to it, by governing each and every part of it, paying attention to the protection of its fruits and crop \ufb01elds, its sustenance and that of its people, peacefulness, price, amounts, and better distribution, in such way as they may agree at any time, and deciding \nwhatever they may deem convenient (\u2026). \u201d\nNew examples and texts can contribute to the treatment of this matter.\n2 . T h el o c a ln o r m a t i v ef a b r i c\nWhen we consider that prior to the nineteenth century there was a world of \ndiverse and autonomous powers \u2013 supernatural, natural and human \u2013, in which norms were created in processes carried out at di fferent levels (Hes-\npanha,\nCultura Jur\u00eddica ), it is easier to understand how law was classi \ufb01ed in \nthe principal Castilian vocabularies of the early modern age. Two of the \nseven categories, speci \ufb01cally concerned the local sphere, which thus \nappeared as a genuine source of power and of law, and not merely as a \npower delegated by another higher sphere. These two categories were the law ordained by the city or town for its private government and that intro-duced by custom. However, the di fferent levels of the legal system were \nimplicitly articulated by overarching principles or values according to sub-\nject matter, people, and circumstances. Provincial and local law were far from being comprehensive and exclusive. On the contrary, they were open to laws and customs of other places and spheres of power.\nIt is diffi cult to de \ufb01ne local law because there is no exclusive sector that \nmay actually be so designated. The approach towards a notion of local law should emanate from each city, province or kingdom, analyzing the fabric of the legal system from the bottom up, watching its development and verify-ing its possibilities to peak or decline. That is to say, a study of this kind is \nlimited to certain geographical areas, and there should be no immediate \nintention of expanding the results obtained to all the Spanish Indies.\nIn his research of the city as a general concept, and Seville in particular, \nbetween the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bartolom\u00e9 Clavero notes the absence of what might be termed \u201ca general system\u201d or \u201ccommunal organ-\nization. \u201d Nor was there a legislative power that could establish the rules to \nProvincial and Local Law of the Indies 241govern the city. What did stand out as an organic whole was the intellectual \npower of ius commune and moral theology case law, which \u201claid down \nprinciples, formulated guidelines and enabled modulation. \u201d It was an e ffec-\ntive construction. In addition, there were other normative levels, some closer to what we now understand as law, other levels of a decidedly moral nature, and some that we could classify as socio-legal practices, with separate legal entity and binding. Within this normative fabric lies a customary back-\nground that \u201ccalls for historiographical creative space. \u201d This same universe \nof multiple norms \u2013 laws, customs and practices \u2013, both written and oral, is a topic deserving patient and intelligent research. Seville can be used as a model for a Spanish American city. And indeed, over the centuries under review this model was frequently referred to.\nWhat was the attitude adopted by the central government of the mon-\narchy towards the mass of norms that wa s continuously being created in the \ndifferent local spheres of its vast territory? The question is part of a funda-\nmental issue, which is the articulation of the di fferent levels of power and, \nobviously, the possibility to control the legal production of the peripheries. \nThe\nConsejo de Indias suffered from an information gap regarding this issue \nand although there were attempts to \ufb01ll it, little could be done to make local \nauthorities in the New World send th e required information on a perma-\nnent basis. Despite the basic interest behind that question, we lack an \nadequate response today, one with the necessary supporting documents. A \nworking hypothesis could be the following: according to the governing style \nthat can be noted in other matters, and given the material impossibility to control all the corners of its political domains, the Crown consented or surreptitiously permitted, and even approved, local or provincial self-man-\nagement and the subsequent legislative production in the understanding \nthat kingdoms, provinces and cities enjoyed jurisdictional and regulatory powers that could not be ignored as long local or provincial authorities continued to recognize and maintained their loyalty toward the supreme political authority in the monarch.\nThis is the issue that deserves the undivided attention of researchers today \nto grasp the way in which such implementation of law was understood in local life, such implementation being an intertwined fabric of case law/legal knowledge and solutions arising from the local socio-legal experience.\n242 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui3. Jurisdictional culture and justice\nIn the research design of a program of this nature, a thematic approach to the \nissue stated in the title is essential. It is perhaps convenient to attempt such an \napproach by resorting to a recent work by Alejandro Ag\u00fcero , in which he sets out the conceptual bases of a study on the topic, whose working hypothesis \nmay be applied to our provinces. By \u201cjurisdictional culture, \u201d Ag\u00fcero means \u201ca \nform of power organization and management which can be observed with sparse variations in every European political space from the late Middle Ages until the end of the eighteenth century. \u201d Underpinning that concept are the \nbasic assumptions that social order rests on the idea of a divinely created \nuniverse beyond the will of humans (transcendent order), and the idea of the supremacy of a community over its individuals that is applied in various associative expressions (corporation). There are other key elements, such as \nthe primacy of religion in the discourse of knowledge, the relationship \nbetween words and things, and the validity of a topical reasoning. The legal culture of the time was thus structured on \u201ca discourse of political power \nexclusively linked to its concept of justice. \u201d The legitimate exercise of power \nwas tied to the theological notion of justice that gave everyone what, as of right, belonged to them. In charge of said exercise was an authority that enjoyed\niurisdictio , that is, it was vested with some degree of jurisdiction. \nIt followed certain rules of procedure and led to the resolution of the issue, \nb a s e do np r o c e d u r a lr i g o ra n dt h ev i r t u e so ft h em a g i s t r a t e .\nAmong the various facets of justice, c riminal justice is worth noting. \nMario Sbriccoli laid out for the European world of the early modern period \na slow transition, entwined by multiple archaistic and modernistic lines, \nfrom a \u201cnegotiated criminal justice\u201d to a \u201chegemonic institutional justice, \u201d which narrowed the room for negotiation and imposed the idea that no justice could exist without punishment of the guilty. The state started \nmonopolizing punitive power by taking over the duty to apply the punish-\nment rigorously on the basis of four technical presuppositions: the law, the act, the evidence, and the sentence. This model can be used as a working \nhypothesis to study the world of the Indies in the early modern period.\nBy way of example, we will refer to Alejandro Ag\u00fcero\u2019s recent work: a \nstudy on these forms of criminal justice in C\u00f3rdoba del Tucum\u00e1n in the \nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This author points out the di fference \nbetween the punitive severity of laws and known practice. Ag\u00fcero \ufb01nds \nProvincial and Local Law of the Indies 243discursive strategies and social practices that helped settle con \ufb02icts without \nresorting to the formal rigor of laws. Clemency, pardon, and complicity by \njudges and by the parties involved (vi ctims and perpetrators) were proce-\ndures that could be seen in practice. This view of criminal justice attempts to \novercome a more unilateral view of that past itself, a consequence of the strong mark le ftby the Enlightenment.\nAnother issue that can be addressed in this area is the one regarding the \nimposition that several local texts \u2013 particularly manifest in the bands of good government of the late eighteenth century \u2013 made on city dwellers: to act as assistants of justice in reporting or detecting di fferent violations of \nlegal and moral norms that were committed in the city and in the country-side.\n4. Family and household order\nIn a study that has become a classic, Otto Brunner discussed with unmatched \n\ufb01nesse the meaning given in Europe until the eighteenth century to the \u201cbig \nhouse\u201d ruled by its master, who had power over economic activity and to \nprotect and control all those living in it, including a broad right to punish his people and the domestic service. It was precisely at that time when \u2013 he adds \u2013 \u201cthe absolute State, which had concentrated in its hands the protec-tion of peace and the police, penetrated the house. \u201d But thanks to the theory \nof natural law peace in the house was enshrined as one of the fundamental \nrights, and only by means of a court order could the power of the state penetrate its sphere.\nThis is the same concept developed in the\nSiete Partidas ,t h a t\u201c t h i sw o r d  \nfamily\u201d \u2013 it reads \u2013 \u201cdenotes the master and his wife, and all the other individuals living in the household under his command, as well as the children and servants and the other servants. \u201d The father of the family was at the top of the small power pyramid sustaining the house, a situation that can be framed within a pyramidal relation as compared to the prince, the \n\u201cfather\u201d of the territory. Alejandro Ag\u00fcero states: \u201cDisciplined by religion \na n dg u i d e db yt h e\nEcon\u00f3mica ,t h ep o w e ro ft h ef a t h e ro ft h ef a m i l yw a s  \nwithdrawn from the rules of jurisdictio nal discourse to the extent that his \nfunction was performed within an organic unity where subjective plurality was as inconceivable as the smallest otherness, required by a balancing game \ndealing with disparate interests implicit in the notion of justice (...). Instead \n244 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguiof mediating between various subjective interests, the function of the father \nof the family was to guard the interests of his home, \u2018manage\u2019 the assets to \nensure the economic viability of the family unit and thus ensure the welfare of its members. \u201d\nThis family scheme prevailing in Europe was transferred to the New \nWorld, where it underwent changes a nd adaptations as required by the \nnew conditions and by the transformations brought about by the diverse \nprocesses of colonization which characterized the typical Spanish and Creole \nfamily of the Indies. A detail worth mentioning is the relevant role played by women when leading the family on some occasions, as stated by Dougnac, due to the frequent absence of their husbands.\nMario G\u00f3ngora explains that \u201cin a socio-historical sense, a house com-\np r i s e sac o n s i d e r a b l en u m b e ro fi n h a b i t a n t s :t h eh e a do ft h eh o u s e h o l d ,h i s  wife, their unmarried sons and daughters, and oft en their married children \nwith their own spouses and children; other relatives, including children born out-of-wedlock; servants and those \u2018added\u2019 to the household, who also used to have off spring. \u201d G\u00f3ngora concludes that \u201cthis is, properly speaking, a \nfamily in the traditional sense. \u201d The head of the household had a wide and strong authority that allowed him to exercise the government and supreme direction of the house, while women, children and the other members of the domestic community owed obedience and submission. He ruled over the family and enjoyed free administration of assets and corrective powers over \nhis children, etc.\nIt is possible to learn about the rich and secretive world of the family and \nthe domestic order, as it operated before the nineteenth century, by reading \nsome passages from the bands of good government. Though their provisions \nare not too explicit, they are always suggestive. They are isolated or minor \nexpressions because the power of the legislature only actually reached the gates of the \u201cbig house. \u201d It is rare to \ufb01nd such provisions recorded before the \nlast quarter of the 18th century.\nThe late appearance of certain precepts regarding the domestic order, \nresulting from the silence of the previo us era, probably serves to prove the \ncondition of the \u201cbig house, \u201d exempt from any jurisdiction alien to it in everyday life, where the civil authority could not enter.\nTexts of a di fferent nature evidence the privileged position enjoyed by the \nbig house or\ncasa de se\u00f1ores . The question arises as to whether these texts are \nremnants or traces of a previous situation or whether they signal the begin-\nProvincial and Local Law of the Indies 245ning of a transformation combining (or rejecting) the intervention of the \ncivil authority and the protection and guarantee of the rights of the individ-\nual. Such contradictory combination of ideas or purposes would not be \nstrange at a time as troubled as that of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\nAs can be seen from the foregoing, the issue o ffers diff erent working \nhypotheses. Researcher Romina Zamora has already conducted signi \ufb01cant \nresearch into the topic in one of the major cities of the region, San Miguel de \nTucum\u00e1n, in the last decades of the 18th century, which may serve as a \nstarting point to further study or to extend it to other cities. Moreover, to the traditional \ufb01gure of the \u201cbig house\u201d or \u201cnoble house\u201d Zamora has added \nthe \u201cplebeian house\u201d whose presence and role is less visible in documents due to the existence of a hierarchical society; perhaps it is mentioned only in \npassing in some documents, these mentions being derogatory at times, but \ndeeply ingrained through customs and social practices.\n5. The concept of property and the common exploitation\nof natural resources\nWhoever embarks on the task of venturing further into local law will \nunavoidably be faced with this key issue. European scholars of legal history, politics and social history (such as Paolo Grossi, Bartolom\u00e9 Clavero, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Maravall and E.P . Thompson) have written clarifying theoretical \nand empirical articles that receive special treatment in every research paper \non the subject.\nAccording to Maravall, \u201cthe concept of property underwent a dramatic \ntransformation\u201d during the \ufb01fteenth and seventeenth centuries. It evolved \n\u201crestrictively to mean the free individual disposition of assets, \u201d deviating from medieval criteria which imposed a set of connections, prescribed com-mon uses, and ordered assistance to the poor and needy. This preface can only introduce us to a very complex issue full of nuances and contradictions, \nas may be corroborated by resorting to the suggestive pages in which Paolo \nGrossi deals with the study of the historical forms of property and the big \ncultural debate on that matter in the 19th century Europe, or to the ones written by Clavero on the matter in the French Revolution. Both provide food for thought and an opportunity for the exchange of ideas.\nThe referred pages written by European scholars do not include the dis-\ntinctive features of this matter in Spanish America so we need to resort to \n246 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguilocal texts. Our aim is to attempt an empirical approach to that complex and \nsometimes contradictory world, where more than one line or path can be \ndiscerned, and where together with a Modern-Age process of innovation, \npersistent medieval traces can still be detected. They can be found in the wording of local legal texts but mainly in their background. The matter appears repeatedly in almost every place, but there are also speci \ufb01c cases that \nought to be singled out.\nA point worthy of mention is the one regarding the community of wild \nwoods, quarries, and rivers. General regulations such as those issued in 1514 were coupled with royal decrees addressed to the R\u00edo de la Plata in 1696, 1708 and 1711, in which natives and residents of the Indies were granted the common use of pastures, woods and waters, and the residents of the city of \nBuenos Aires were allowed the enjoyment thereof, and could even cross the \nriver to Colonia del Sacramento, for the exploitation of wood and \ufb01rewood \nwithout limitation (Mariluz Urquijo). This generalized system started to encounter weak or open resistance depending on how advanced the con-ceptions proclaiming the individual an d absolute nature of property \u2013 which \nexcluded all forms of collective exploitation \u2013 were.\nT h ec o m m o ne x p l o i t a t i o no fv a r i o u sn a t u r a lr e s o u r c e sb e g a nt ob e  \nrestricted by the eighteenth century, as much to establish their exclusive u s eb yt h ec i t yr e s i d e n t s\u2013a n de x c l u d eo u t s i d e r sw i t h o u tal i c e n s e\u2013a st o  declare illegal formerly accepted practices or customs of common use, which \nwere now de \ufb01n e da s\u201c a b u s e , \u201d\u201ct h e ft\u201d or \u201crobbery\u201d . These texts must be read \ncarefully and between the lines. In a chapter of the band of Buenos Aires \nGovernor Berm\u00fadez, of 1715, it is stated: \u201cnone be bold to commit wrongs in the city or in the \ufb01eld by taking horses, oxen, cows, fruit or any other \nthing for, though trivial as it may seem, it will be\ndeclared the ftas the taking \nwas against the owner\u2019s will ... \u201d It seems here that theftwas being introduced \nas a criminal o ffence to make a sharp distinction between the thing subject \nto the exclusive will of its owner and what could fall within the scope of an eventual common use in practice or, at least, tolerated common use.\nIn these blurred boundaries between what can be de \ufb01ned as an object of \nindividual property or common exploitation, it is worth resorting to another text of the band of Santa Fe, written in 1709, in which the deputy governor expressed that \u201cbecause I am aware of the very serious chaos and lack of fear when it comes to the\ntheftof mules, horses, oxen, cows, calves and other \nservice animals because it is not yet considered a venial crime , and that not even \nProvincial and Local Law of the Indies 247indoors can said animals be safe, I hereby order that \u2026\u201d no person \u201cunder \nany circumstances may take livestock or animals of this kind without the \nexpress authorization of their owners \u2026\u201d The text recognizes, by means of \ncertain idiomatic turns \u2013 highlighted in italics \u2013, the existence of a practice or use not typi \ufb01ed as a crime that the new rule purports to change, by \nconsidering it the ftand prescribing an express penalty. This was an attempt \nto sketch out an order in which the individual property of things was \nbecoming more clearly de \ufb01ned. The idiomatic turn used in the provision \nto establish the requirement to obtain express authorization from the owner \nto take a livestock leads us to infer that the person did not have the intent to claim ownership over the livestock, but rather to use it temporarily as some-thing available for common use.\nA very clear example can be found in an order issued by the\nCabildo of \nSan Luis in 1779, which reads: \u201cAll individuals shall refrain from the common \npractice of stealing branches and \ufb01rewood from stubbles and fences \u2026 and \nthose burglarizing farms or stealing fruit shall be subject to the same penalty. \u201d \nThis is neither the place nor the time to engage in certain digressions, but \nthis order to refrain from a \u201ccommon practice, \u201d which is then treated as \nstealing and later extended to cover other acts of burglary of farms or the ft \nof fruits, seems suggestive. It gives the impression that we are faced with a text pinpointing, by means of highlighted words, transitional moments between the common exploitation of certain natural elements and a stricter \nprivacy and exclusivity in the use of individual property.\n6. The relation between the universal and the particular\nin canon law\nT h e r ea r ef e wa r e a so fl a wt h a th a v eb e e na ss i g n i \ufb01cant to the everyday lives \nof the men and women of the Old Regime as canon law. Its rules governed \nlife and death, accompanying people from baptism to extreme unction. On the periphery of the Empire in particular, the priest was o ften the only \nlawyer, and law was taught solely at the seminary. Notwithstanding this great signi \ufb01cance to daily life, which historians of various \ufb01elds have increas-\ningly detected, the norms of canon law applied locally were based on nor-mative corpora dating from the Middle Ages, intended for the faithful as a whole. This relation between the universal conception of these norms, de-\nsigned to govern the whole Catholic world, and their particular scope of \n248 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguiapplication, with the required adaptations and adjustments, makes the study \nof canon law an enlightening experience for the program described.\nAmong the various sources that can be studied in this context, so far we \nhave analyzed, \ufb01rstly, some problems based on the provisions of diocesan \nsynods (Martini, Dellaferrera). Another highly interesting source consists of texts emerging from university teaching that reveal conscious and uncon-scious adjustments, the use of\nius commune sources and the changes intro-\nduced in an attempt to select and present the required material for jurists in a certain place. Some of the classes taught in courses of canon law at the University of C\u00f3rdoba del Tucum\u00e1n are particularly enriching in this context and have been published recently, among them a treatise on impediments to marriage, the fruit of classes taught during the year 1734 (Silvano GA Benito \nMoya/Guillermo de Santis). This treaty contains\ndisputationes on key aspects \nof the canonical doctrine of marriage \u2013 violence and fear; clandestine mar-\nriage; impediment of relationship (cognatio) \u2013 and off ers the possibility to \nanalyze the abovementioned aspects about the modus operandi of the jurist in \nthe Cordoba of the 18th century, comparing the explanation with other \ncontemporary sources (such as Ius canonicum universum by Reiff enstuel). \nFurthermore, it allows a comparison between university education and for-\nensic practice.\nThomas Duve has posed questions regarding the local application of \nderecho can\u00f3nico indiano , including to what extent the particular experiences \nof the implementation of norms in the Indies impacted upon the Old World. Thus, he states that \u201cthe dialectic between the realization of authority in the transplant of the canon law tradition to the Indies on the one hand, and pluralization within this legal cul ture might even contribute to discover \nat r u e\nAtlantic dimension of Legal History, beyond the studies on the unilat-\neral reception of the European legal culture in the Indies. \u201d\nIII. Research Methodology\nThe program falls within the discipline of legal history and, therefore, fol-lows its methodological guidelines, which were amended throughout the 20th century. The long-standing debate over whether this is historical or legal science \u2013 o ften settled with eclectic criteria \u2013 has been overcome. The posi-\ntion of the discipline between History and Law generated interest and was \nscienti\ufb01cally sound when Dogmatics was highly regarded in the legal \ufb01eld, \nProvincial and Local Law of the Indies 249and the legal dimension was dismissed by historians. Both situations have \nchanged.\nThat relation progressively changed as a stronger link between law and \nsociety was sought, and broader \u201cmethodological freedom\u201d was introduced that sought to incorporate other disciplines \u2013 sociology, anthropology, liter-ature, linguistics, theology, political science, etc. \u2013 and open up possibilities for the development of interdisciplinary work, while still acknowledging \nthat Legal History has an individuality and a scienti \ufb01co b s e r v a t o r yo fi t s  \nown, which off ers its \ufb01ndings to other areas of knowledge.\nA very noticeable consequence of this change has been an improved \narticulation between normativity and social reality. To achieve this, it is \nnecessary to move out of the narrow scope in which Dogmatics enclosed \nthe notion of law, ignoring any other normative sphere than that established \nby the positive law of the State. In Antonio M. Hespanha\u2019s words,\u201cThe most relevant criticism against traditional Legal History is not so much its\nformal-\nismas its dogmatism .T h ef o r m e rm a yc o n s t i t u t eap o s i t i v ea t t i t u d ei nt h a ti t  \nsafeguards legal institutional autonomy and avoids reductive determinism; \nthe latter prevents any historical contextualization, because institutions or \ndoctrinal dogmas are found to be necessary models (and therefore ahistor-ical) derived from the nature of things or rational evidence. In contrast, the proposed orientation, in relativizing le gal institutional models, draws us to \nconsider the study from a historical perspective, placing these models in the \ncontext of the\nhistory of cultural forms and, consequently, their insertion in \npractical contexts\u201d ( European legal culture ).\nThere is a tendency to set aside the \ufb01rm conviction that considered of \nscienti\ufb01c interest to the historian only those matters that the dogmatic legal scholar de \ufb01ned as pertaining to the legal \ufb01eld. From these new standpoints, it \nis interesting to admit the existence of normative orders outside the one \nofficially recognized and, generally, this helps expand the researcher\u2019s horizon.\nThis also leads to a more frequent use, with true methodological root, of \nthe phrase \u201clegal culture of the Indies\u201d \u2013 virtually unknown in the past \u2013 \ninstead of \u201cCastilian-Indian legislation\u201d (as has hitherto been usual), since it \nis a deeper and more comprehensive phrase alluding to a phenomenon that cannot be restricted to the legal sphere. It is useful to bear this in mind when analyzing local issues.\nPursuing a research program of this nature, which falls squarely into the \nspeci \ufb01c discipline of Legal History, requires looking into and incorporating \n250 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguiconceptual tools and documentary and bibliographic material of other sci-\nenti\ufb01c disciplines that foster the study of humankind and society.\nIV .

The series aims to privilege studies dedicated to reconstructing the historical  evolution of normativity from a global perspective.
