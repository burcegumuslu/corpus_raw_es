She chose to discuss this topic because it's an issue she has addressed many times. Enlarged tonsils can be hereditary, but there are some homeopathic remedies that can be used at home to help children with this condition.\nSue referred to a book called \"The Best of Burnett\" compiled by Dr. H.L. Chitkara, which contains information from James Compton Burnett. She emphasized the importance of reading books on homeopathy, as they provide valuable information for different ailments and remedies.\nLink to The Best of Burnett: https://amzn.to/3spVBgD\nDiving into the topic of enlarged tonsils, Sue shared information from James Compton Burnett's book. He mentions a homeopathic remedy called Baryta Carbonica which has been known to be effective for enlarged tonsils in specific situations.\nSue discussed the importance of looking at the symptoms and the person as a whole when treating illnesses. She mentioned \"miasms\" or hereditary dispositions, specifically focusing on the tubercular miasm. She recommends studying the 12 miasms for a better understanding of these dispositions. Individuals with a tubercular disposition may experience symptoms such as swollen lymph nodes, enlarged tonsils, and even a sunken chest. However, these symptoms may only manifest if the person becomes extremely ill, lacks proper nutrition, or other related situations where there is great supression.\nHere's a great training Sue has on Miasms - Class 6 in her Advanced Homeopathy Series: https://homeopathyformommies.com/fall-study-group-series-live-sue-meyer/\nIf you would like to join the Members Corner and access the show notes to this podcast, go to: https://members.homeopathyformommies.com\n-\n[The Power of Activated Charcoal](https://podcasts.apple.com/hn/podcast/the-power-of-activated-charcoal/id907988339?i=1000626225814)\nThe Power of Activated Charcoal\nThis week on Homeopathy for Mommies, Sue Meyer delves into the world of activated charcoal, a supplement that has been used for centuries to treat poisonings and stomach upsets.\nActivated Charcoal: An Ancient Remedy\nActivated charcoal is a medication that has been used for centuries to treat poisonings. It's made more porous through a process of superheating, which increases its absorption power. Just one teaspoon of activated charcoal can absorb all the toxins on a football field. Isn't that amazing?\nOur bodies are constantly exposed to toxins, even in urban areas where pesticides are sprayed without permission. Activated charcoal is known for its ability to absorb toxins and is often used in cases of poisoning or overdose. It can be taken orally or administered through a nasogastric tube. It's also effective in treating respiratory issues and can absorb toxins through the respiratory tract.\nThe process of making activated charcoal involves heating carbon-rich materials such as wood, peat, coconut shells, or sawdust. This process strips the charcoal of previously absorbed molecules and increases its overall surface area, allowing it to absorb toxins effectively.\nThe Health Benefits of Activated Charcoal\nSeveral studies suggest activated charcoal may assist kidney function by filtering out toxins and drugs. It may also help reduce gastrointestinal damage and inflammation in individuals with chronic kidney disease. Additionally, activated charcoal has been found to be beneficial in reducing intestinal gas and abdominal pain.\nActivated charcoal is commonly used for water filtration and can remove fluoride from water without removing beneficial minerals. It is also used as an anti-diarrheal medication, particularly for diarrhea caused by bacteria or toxic sources. It has potential benefits for teeth whitening, skin care, deodorizing, and treating skin infections.\nActivated Charcoal: A Personal Experience\nI frequently take activated charcoal due to my sensitivity to food preservatives. I recommend other homeopathic remedies like Nux Vomica, Lycopodium, or Arsenicum for stomach aches, along with activated charcoal.\nI believe in the importance of having activated charcoal in a first aid kit and consider it a supplement to a diet in today's toxic environment. I'm concerned about the exposure of organic foods to pesticides and chemicals, and I shared an anecdote about non-organic potatoes being falsely labeled as organic.\nThe Power of Activated Charcoal\nDuring a period of illness, my oxygen levels were consistently low despite using carbo veg, a homeopathic remedy. After consulting with a chiropractor friend, I learned that the cells in my lungs were coated with carbon monoxide, preventing them from absorbing oxygen properly. Upon the suggestion of my friend, I started taking activated charcoal, which resulted in a significant improvement in my oxygen levels within a few hours.\nActivated charcoal not only works on the respiratory system but also cleanses other body systems by pulling toxins and heavy metals. I suggest taking one capsule a day or adjusting the frequency based on individual needs and reactions. Activated charcoal can be taken in different forms, such as capsules, powder, or mixed in smoothies, depending on personal preference.\nI'm grateful for the opportunity to share this information and encourage you to explore the benefits of activated charcoal for yourselves.

However, I later learned about natural alternatives such as diatomaceous earth and coconut oil, which I found to be effective. I also took a naturopathy class and was shocked to learn about the importance of maintaining a healthy pH balance in ruminant animals to prevent parasites from thriving.\nOver 50% of a ruminant animal's food should be dried stocks, such as hay, which forces them to chew and produce more saliva, resulting in a lower stomach pH. This helps to strengthen their immune system and fight parasites more effectively.\nNatural Remedies for Parasite Management\nI have had personal success with using coconut oil to expel parasites from my animals. Feeding coconut oil to my larger animals caused parasites to come out of the skin and leave the body. I also used diatomaceous earth, which kills and dries up parasites, along with homeopathy to balance the body and create an unfriendly environment for parasites. I haven't had to worry about parasites in my animals for 20 years using these methods.\nThe Parasite De-worm Mini Kit\nI also recommend using a combination remedy called the parasite de-worm mini kit, which is alternated in the animals' water for 1 to 2 weeks. Additionally, treating the pasture or barnyard with diatomaceous earth can further control parasites. Diatomaceous earth is made of fossilized remains of tiny aquatic organisms and contains silica, which is beneficial for the body. However, it is important to avoid inhaling it or getting it in the eyes.\nHomeopathic Remedies for Parasites\nOn my website, I offer a pet parasite worm kit, as well as a list of homeopathic remedies for parasites. These remedies range from Aconite to Sulfur and cover a wide range of symptoms and types of parasites.\nTreating Worm Complaints in Children\nIt's also crucial to address worm complaints in children. While there are fewer remedies listed for children, Aconite, Belladonna, and Cina are among the top remedies for worm complaints in children.\nInterestingly, the moon's phases can influence worm complaints. Parasite problems can cause symptoms such as constipation, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. They can also affect animals and it's important to treat them regularly to maintain their health.\nIn conclusion, I encourage everyone to address parasite problems using homeopathy and natural means. It's a journey I've been on for 20 years and I can confidently say that it's been effective for me. I hope my experiences and insights can help you on your journey too.\nThe content of the Homeopathy for Mommies Radio post or page, including text, graphics, images, or information contained in text or audio, or other content, is offered on an informational basis only.

Eye floaters are tiny objects inside the eyeball that cast shadows on the retina. They can be bits of tissue, red blood cells, or clumps of protein. Suspended within the vitreous humor, the gel-like liquid that fills the inside of the eye, these floaters move and change shape with eye movements.\nSue also touched on another visual phenomenon called the blue field entoptic phenomenon, which is different from floaters. This is caused by white blood cells moving through the capillaries in the retina. While floaters are usually harmless, abnormally numerous or large floaters that interfere with vision may be a sign of something more serious and should be checked by an eye doctor.\nSue explored homeopathic remedies that can be considered for floaters and vision anomalies. She mentioned remedies like phosphorus, silica, sulfur, and mercury. The best option is always to have a consultation with a homeopath to take your case.\nRemember, if you have more questions about eye floaters or anything about the eyes, feel free to become a member and access the full mini training in the Members Corner.\nLinks: Https://members.homeopathyformommies.com\nMore podcasts: https://ultimateradioshow.com/homeopathyformommies/\n----\nThe content of the Homeopathy for Mommies Radio post or page, including text, graphics, images, or information contained in text or audio, or other content, is offered on an informational basis only.

Back in 2017, I briefly touched on this topic in a blog post and over time this has been one of the top accessed blog posts on my website.\nI\u2019ve had occasion to use a very popular remedy called Staphysagria. This remedy is famous for physical issues like surgery, incisions, having been cut, or injured.\nHowever we're going to talk about it today for it's use for emotional effects of physical and emotional harm to a victim. This remedy is amazing for healing \u201cthe whole person\u201d during difficult times of injury and victimization.\nOver time I have come to realize that this is one of those remedies that will probably be needed in just about everyone\u2019s life at some time or other.\nListen in as I share about this remedy in this week's podcast.\n-\n[Zincum Metallicum: When There is Suppression](https://podcasts.apple.com/hn/podcast/zincum-metallicum-when-there-is-suppression/id907988339?i=1000617151466)\nZincum Metallicum: When There is Suppression\nThis week on Homeopathy for Mommies, we have another Remedy Review! This week we are talking about Zincum Metallicum.\n\"The common old school use of zinc ointment to suppress eruptions and zinc injections to suppress discharges is based on fact. Zincum does suppress them. And it transfers the morbid action to the nervous system, setting up a poisoning there, and conversely in homeopathic attenuations Zincum can reverse the process. It can restore suppressed eruptions, it can cure the consequences of suppressions, and can set free the reactive power in conditions of undeveloped disease.\" -John H. Clarke\nHere are some keynotes of this remedy:\nHyper, over-stimulated and over-sensitive patients. This over stimulated state is liable to be followed by a collapse which results in mental dullness; leaving the person Dull, Complaining and dissatisfied. Brain/Nerves are fatigued. Restless feet in continued motion; cannot keep them still. Lame/Weak/Trembling/Twitching/ General aggravation from suppressed eruptions.; from suppressed menses and better with the flow. Only feels well during menses. General aggravation from wine. Restlessness. Twitches, jerks, fasciculations.\n*Suits Well: Nervous constitutions.\n~Effects of: Fright. Grief. Anger. Surgery. Night watching. Excessive study. From brain concussion. Frostbite. Suppressions of eruptions. Otorrhea. Menses. Lochia; Milk. Chorea from fright or from suppressed eruptions.
