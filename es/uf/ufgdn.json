But that hasn\u2019t instilled confidence among the 4,000 Rastafarians who make up about 1.5% of the population.\nThe Rastafarian movement wrote to Prime Minister Mia Mottley requesting that its members be issued certificates of exemption from vaccination requirements.\nIn a two-and-a-half page letter dated 18 January, 2021 and signed by Rock and RPM Secretary Empress Andrea, the movement also called on the Prime Minister to meet with them to discuss their option of using natural medicines as an alternative, including the Madagascar COVID -19 organics.\nThe letter read, in part: \u201cIn a recent address to the nation, you stated that it was the aim of the\ngovernment to vaccinate 60% to 70% of the population. The Rastafari community should be considered one that is least at risk due to our healthy lifestyle.\u201d The letter argues their community should be considered for \u201cexemption.\u201d\nRock told CIJN Rastafarians want the government to issue documents exempting them from \u201cvaccine passports\u201d that might be required by other countries to travel.\nBarbados\u2019 Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr Kenneth George flatly dismissed that demand.\n\u201cHow can a government give exemptions to a group that is not vaccinated?\u201d If foreign nations require proof of vaccination to enter, Dr. George said it was impossible for the Ministry of Health to declare any of its citizens exempt.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say, for example, to travel to the United Kingdom you need to have a vaccine\u2026if that is the case, the Rastafarian community can\u2019t travel to the United Kingdom. There is no other way to do it,\u201d he told CIJN.\nThe Chief Medical Officer expressed concern that by refusing to take the vaccine, Rastafarians have the potential to make the COVID situation worse.\n\u201cWhile it is within their right to do so, the good public health advice is that vaccines are the only public health intervention currently known, to stem this pandemic\u2026the more persons we have opting out, theworse it would be for the population at large,\u201d Dr George warned.\nWhile the Rastafarians are refusing to take the vaccine, they are willing to be tested for the virus under some circumstances.\n\u201cPeople are not opposed to the testing per se.\u201d Rock says some Rastas have taken the test but they don\u2019t support testing solely for testing sake. Rock says they often take the test only to prove they are not positive for COVID-19.\nHe said even though he is hard-pressed to find any Rastafari brother or sister who has contracted COVID-19, he was not ruling out that possibility.\nThe Rastafarian leader has declared the group\u2019s compliance with the government\u2019s COVID-19 protocols at least in the wider public spaces. According to him, they observe mask-wearing and physical distancing when on the streets or in business places, but do not always wear masks within their small social gatherings.\nFear of \u201cVaccination Intimidation\u201d\nIt is not only the Rastafarians who are taking a strong stand against the COVID-19 shot, but others, as well.\nWinston Clarke, who is a Muslim and social activist, leads a petition campaign against what he calls \u201cvaccination intimidation.\u201d Clarke says he has already surpassed the original goal of 3,000 signatures from a cross-section of the Barbadian society that includes whites, members of church groups, non-governmental organisations and Pan Africanists.\nHis concerns are clear enough. If private businesses, airlines and music or sporting venues begin requiring proof of vaccination, those who refuse to get the vaccine could find themselves limited in travel abroad and locked out of normal life at home. Clarke fears that could effectively force people to accept the vaccinations.\nThe Rastafarians have joined forces with Clarke on this issue.\nIn mid-May, one of the country\u2019s leading luxury beach resorts attracted wide public attention over a proposal by management to require unvaccinated employees to submit to weekly COVID-19 testing if they wanted to hold onto their jobs. Workers protested, branded the policy \u201cintimidation\u201d and the resort was forced to withdraw the policy.\nAs some Caribbean nations try to rebuild their tourism industries battered by the pandemic, there\u2019s a collective concern the islands are trending toward mandatory vaccinations within specific occupations or activities.\nBoth Prime Minister Mottley and her Minister of Health and Wellness Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Bostic have been adamant in various public forums that residents of the island won\u2019t be forced to take the injection.\n\u201cObviously we encourage everyone to take the vaccine, but it is not a mandatory kind of situation and people are free to take the vaccine if that is their desire, so we only encourage people to take the vaccine,\u201d Minister Bostic said.\nA similar position was expressed by the Prime Minister during an address to the nation back in February 2021.\nTravel Restrictions in Place\nThe Government decreed that from May 8, 2021 all visitors to the island will be subjected to various levels of health protocol restrictions based on vaccination requirements.\nFor example, travelers who are fully vaccinated and come to Barbados with a valid negative COVID PCR test carried out no more than three days prior to arrival, will get a rapid PCR test done at the airport or at their approved accommodation.\nWhile awaiting their on-island PCR test results, fully vaccinated travelers will be restricted to their approved accommodation where they are free to move around in accordance with the guidelines of the property.\nAs soon as they receive that negative PCR test, travelers can venture out.\nRastafarians Hope \u201cOrganic\u201d Medicines Will Be Recognized\nRastafarian leader Simba Rock has repeated the movement\u2019s beliefs in the efficacy of holistic medicines to protect against COVID-19.\nIn particular, he points to Madagascar\u2019s COVID organics. In 2020, Madagascar launched COVID-Organics(CVO), an organic blend of herbs, claiming it can both treat and prevent COVID-19.\nAmid online fanfare, Madagascar\u2019s President Andry Rajoelina hailed the \u2018breakthrough\u2019 for his country and its use of herbal COVID-19 remedies.\n\u201cWe are proud to inaugurate Pharmalagasy, the first national pharmaceutical factory which aims to conquer the African continent through the manufacture of non-chemical herbal medicine,\u201d President Rajoelina said in a series of tweets.\nThe celebration was short-lived. In May 2021 the government announced Madagascar has been closed to all commercial and private air traffic amid what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control depicted as a Level 4 outbreak of COVID-19.\nThe Madagascar government has been importing vaccines to try to control the situation.\nBarbados Says \u201cNo\u201d\nThe Barbados government isn\u2019t debating the efficacy of organic treatments. Chief Medical Officer Dr. Kenneth George dismissed any chance of the government sanctioning the use of herbal medicines at this stage for the treatment of the virus.\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health does not subscribe to herbal treatments for COVID,\u201d Dr. George told CIJN. \u201cWe continue to work with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other international organisations to give guidance in this area. If at any point in time herbs do come up in a different place and are sanctioned by the appropriate authority, consideration will be given\u2026but at this point in time, the answer to that question is no.\u201d\nThe Rastafarians are not giving up hope. But they concede their trust in natural remedies must be proven in full clinical trials to gain acceptance.\nThe issue of \u201cvaccination intimidation\u201d is another matter. The concerns voiced on this island are reflected in other Caribbean nations and around the world. The Rastafarians are a colorful and active community that punches above its weight in Barbados. Their influence will be one of the factors that determines the success of the government\u2019s vaccination drive.", "language": null, "image":
