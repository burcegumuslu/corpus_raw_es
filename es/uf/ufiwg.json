DetoX was developed by WWF\u2019s InternationalToxics Programme. Its main aim being to ensure that thenewly proposed legislation on chemicals, REACH, woulddeliver WWF goals to identify and phase out the mosthazardous chemicals and ensure that safety information onall chemicals on the EU market be publicly available.\nWWF saw REACH as a unique opportunity to close the\nknowledge gap on chemicals and secure a safermanagement system for chemicals in Europe. Influencingthe content of the mammoth REACH legislation andfighting one of the biggest and most powerful industries inEurope for over 3 years was certainly a challenge!WWF\u2019s DetoX campaign supported policy and lobbying\nthrough an ambitious communication programme. This wasdesigned to create awareness amongst decision makersand the public on chemical contamination with mainlyunknown effects, the proven negative effects of somechemicals, the fact that an important decision makingprocess was ongoing and the need to take action. \nWWF\u2019s DetoX campaign was highly successful in making\nEuropean citizens and decision makers aware of theshocking lack of safety information for the large majority ofchemicals used in daily life. Co-operation with scientistsand medical experts and their research on chemicalcontamination in wildlife and people helped put the issueunder the spotlight. \nThe campaign team successfully engaged most WWF\nEuropean national organisations. It was also supported byactivities outside the EU, such as the \u201cUS Declaration ofindependence of hazardous chemicals\u201d which wasorganised by WWF US. Also, close partnerships with otherenvironmental and health NGOs, consumer groups andtrade unions assured a powerful platform from which toraise our concerns and become a leading voice in theREACH debate.\nDetoX team.

By literally gettingunder the people\u2019s skin, everyone realized the intimateglobal nature of the problem. REACH became everyone\u2019sissue.\nWWF UK initiated the process in 2003, testing over 150\nvolunteers in the UK including politicians and journalists inpartnership with the Cooperative Bank. With the debate onREACH entering full speed and an ever growing interestfrom key decision makers to be associated to thecampaign, WWF organised the testing of  40 Members ofthe European Parliament, 14 Ministers across Europe,doctors and scientists, journalists and celebrities. Thisculminated, in the spring of 2005, with the impressive study\u201cGenerations X\u201d, testing 3 generations of 13 Europeanfamilies. In all cases, results showed that people werecontaminated with a chemical cocktail whose long-termeffects remain largely unknown.The European launch of the family blood-test results just\nbefore the First Reading vote on REACH in the autumn of2005 obtained unprecedented media coverage, includingprime time news. The issue of chemical contamination haddefinitely touched a public nerve. Expectations were beingplaced firmly on EU decision-makers to secure a strongEuropean chemical legislation. \nIn September 2006, at the start of the official Second\nReading negotiations on REACH, DetoX presented a newinsight into the global chain of contamination: the presenceof man-made chemicals in food, the most important humanexposure for many persistent, bio-accumulative andendocrine disrupting chemicals. Food items from dairy toolive oil, honey, fish and meat purchased in supermarketsin the UK, Italy, Spain, Greece, Sweden, Finland andPoland were analyzed for eight different groups of man-made chemicals. Results found potentially harmfulsynthetic chemicals in all of the analysed samples. Thisstudy was backed by Cascade, the European network ofscientific excellence on chemicals in food. Prime timetelevision and radio news programmes brought the story tothe attention of the public in Europe and beyond. Thefollowing week, in the Parliament\u2019s Environment Committee,a large majority of Members voted again in favour ofsubstitution of the most hazardous chemicals. \nLeft: Finnish family daughter participating in the \u201cGenerations X\u201d biomonitoring.  |  Right: Spanish environment minister Crist ina Narbona testing her blood for chemicals.\nTop: Arctic fox asleep, Canada. \u00a9 WWF-Canon / Fran\u00e7ois PIERREL.\nA truly European\ncampaign\nOperating from the heart of EU decision-making, DetoX ran\nin parallel in 13 European countries, giving it a truly Europeanimpact. With the leadership of the core team in Brussels,WWF\u2019s national offices managed to place the need for astronger EU regulation on chemicals in the media, withpoliticians and ultimately, in the minds of the people, therebyincreasing the pressure on EU decision-makers. The globalmedia success achieved with the involvement of most WWFEuropean offices in the biomonitoring studies, and the reporton contamination of the food chain, were crucial in making aEurope-wide breakthrough on the political debate front andin the public\u2019s awareness. \nSome national highlights include:\nHaving taken part in WWF\u2019s biomonitoring\nsurvey, the mother of the Belgian familytested (a doctor herself) started a strong\npersonal campaign to persuade the medical community,the media and the Belgian politicians of the need for astrong REACH. \nIn May 2006, after strong pressure from\nWWF and other Danish NGOs, DanishMembers of the European Parliament sent a\nletter to the REACH \u201crapporteur\u201d supporting thesubstitution of hazardous chemicals. The campaign alsoattracted huge media attention.\nIn Finland, the family blood testing became\nsuch a hot topic of conversation that peoplecould be overheard talking about it on public\ntransport and in supermarkets. Very good cooperation wasestablished with Finnish Members of the European Parliament,which has now been extended to other environmental issues.\nIn France, following an event in the\nEuropean Parliament with Frenchcompanies in favour of substituting harmful\nchemicals for safer alternatives, WWF is now working withthe French Environment Ministry to persuade othercompanies to choose safer chemicals.\nIn Germany, the family blood testing and\nreports about wildlife contamination resultedin good media coverage about the problem\nof chemical contamination. In Greece, DetoX put together a strong\ncoalition of consumers, trade unions,professional organizations and media that\neffectively influenced the national debate on REACH. \nIn Hungary, WWF built a coalition of NGOs on\nREACH and was chosen to represent theirpoints of view in the Hungarian REACH ad-\nhoc committee. The TV spot featuring a Hungarian Memberof the European Parliament was run on 24 TV channels.\nAfter testing the blood of 18 Italian\ncelebrities and politicians, an on-linechemical contamination self-test attracted\nmore than 22.000 visitors in a week. Numerous streetactions, joint petitions and email campaigns targeted ItalianMembers of the European Parliament and placed the toxicsissue high up on the political agenda.\nIn Latvia, two years of street actions, many\npublications, discussions, lectures andcontacts with top officials brought chemical\ncontamination into the public arena.\nIn Poland, DetoX engaged celebrities and\ngenerated one of the most intensive mediacampaigns in Europe, including a television\nspot with Polish celebrities that was shown in cinemas anda widely played song created by famous Polish pop stars.\nIn Spain, getting the Minister for\nEnvironment to test her blood for chemicalsand the launch of several chemical\ncontamination reports were key in attracting the attention ofcitizens, media and politicians. WWF/Adena forged goodrelationships with key MEPs and worked closely with otherSpanish organisations to put REACH on the Spanishgovernment\u2019s political agenda.\nIn Sweden, DetoX has been the most\nsuccessful WWF campaign ever. It hasgenerated extensive media coverage on the\ntoxics issue and kept the pressure on Swedish politiciansto vote for a strong REACH\nIn the UK, the excellent media coverage of\ncampaign activities and reports increasedpublic awareness of the campaign. Intense\npolitical contacts and media pressure made UK Tory leader,David Cameron, join the ranks for a strong REACH andcross-party support for the substitution of hazardouschemicals was achieved in the European Parliament\u2019sEnvironment Committee vote. \nLeft: A 77.000 signature petition was presented in Brussels by WWF UK and the National Federation of Women\u2019s Institutes.  |  Ri ght: EU Commissioner, Stavros Dimas, receiv-\ning the mother of the Greek family blood tested for chemicals.An integrated\nmedia campaign\nDetoX used innovative communication tools\nto hold the public\u2019s attention and rally\ncampaigners and decision makers to its key\nbattles. Over three years of campaigning,\nDetoX organised several press conferences and\nput out more than 200 press releases, position\npapers and internet features on the issue of chemical\ncontamination and the REACH political process. This\nhelped to position WWF as one of the key NGOs on\nREACH. \nDetoX\u2019s biomonitoring studies and wildlife contamination\nreports obtained unprecedented media coverage all over\nEurope. Top newspapers and broadcasters such as the\nBBC, Financial Times, CNN, Reuters and Associated Press\u2013 as well as hundreds of national media - covered WWF\u2019sbiomonitoring studies and main campaign reports. In manycases, the strong media pressure translated into directpositive political moves. \nIn September 2006, building on the success of a TV spot\nthat WWF Poland prepared with national celebrities, DetoXmade an international version featuring 4 key Members ofthe European Parliament. The spot was launched in theEuropean Parliament when the second round ofdiscussions on REACH was starting. It was also broadcaston Euronews and many national TV channels. At the sametime, and as part of an integrated approach to\ncommunications, a printed version appeared in Europeanmagazines, poster-size prints were displayed around theEuropean area in Brussels and an online version wasdownloaded by thousands of viewers from video portalssuch as youtube.com. \nDetoX also made full use of Internet and web-based\ncommunications. Creative web animations were used toexplain, for instance, how industrial chemicals travel to theArctic. Educational games, such as an \u201con-line chemicalcontamination test\u201d that was successfully launched byWWF Italy, were spread across EU countries.\nStreet stunts, launched during key political moments, also\nattracted significant media attention. Vampires in many EUcapitals ventured into daylight to demand clean blood. A\u201ctoxic family\u201d approached European ministers during ameeting in Brussels equipped with a \u201cchemical detector\u201d,demanding strong protection against toxic chemicals.\nLeft: key Members of the European Parliament confess they have been in contact with toxic chemicals.  |  Right: DetoX Campaign Director, Karl Wagner, at the press \nconference launching WWF\u2019s biomonitoring results.  |  Top: Vampires take the streets in different European cities demanding \u201ccl ean blood\u201d.2003 2001\n2004February 2001\nJanuary 2003\nFebruary 2003\nMarch 2003\nApril 2003\nMay 2003\nJune 2003\nJuly 2003\nAugust 2003\nSeptember 2003\nOctober 2003\nNovember 2003\nDecember 2003\nJanuary 2004\nFebruary 2004\nMarch 2004\nApril 2004\nMay 2004\nJune 2004\nJuly 2004\nAugust 2004\nSeptember 2004\nOctober 2004\nNovember 2004\nDecember 2004\nJanuary 2005\nFebruary 2005\nMarch 2005\nApril 2005\nMay 2005\n2001 2003 200413.02.2001\nCommission adopts a White Paperoutlining the REACH principles\n23.09.2003Chirac-Schroeder-Blair letter on REACHsays that REACH needs \u201csubstantialchanges\u201d and that \u201cwe must ensure thatwe do not place unnecessary burden onindustry\u201d.

At European level DetoXengaged with all three EU institutions - the Council ofMinisters, the European Parliament and the EuropeanCommission - with the support of WWF nationalorganisations. Offices at national level also undertookcrucial work to influence the position of their nationalgovernments. \nDetoX managed to build up cross party support for its\npriority demands in many key national delegations of theEuropean Parliament. This has particularly been reflected inthe results of the votes in the Environment Committee andat Parliament first plenary vote on the control of the mosthazardous chemicals. DetoX also had a fundamental role in countering industry\u2019s\nfierce attacks against the establishment of the REACHsystem as a whole and its endless attempts to water downits key provisions. \nWith this sustained work at each step of the process, WWF\nmanaged to establish itself as a highly respected voice inthe REACH debate. Many of the communication initiativeswere also great opportunities to engage politicians incampaign actions and secure real sympathy for thepriorities WWF was promoting. \nPolicy briefings, fact sheets, publications on the socio-\neconomic aspects of the legislation and informative events,often organised in the European Parliament, have all beencrucial tools in helping politicians to understand thecomplex issues at stake in the REACH legislation.\nLeft: WWF DetoX demonstration in front of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.  |  Right: Ex-Commissioner Margot Wallstr\u00f6m vi siting a DetoX exhibition with Tony Long,\nWWF EPO Director.  |  Bottom left: Bloodtested families during a photo opportunity with Members of the European Parliament.\nHighlighting \nnew evidence \nWWF used its scientific expertise to reveal the chemical\ncontamination that humans, wildlife and the environmentare being increasingly exposed to, thereby making the casefor a strong REACH all the more pressing.\nWWF\u2019s DetoX campaign successfully contributed in\nhighlighting the fact that many scientists are becomingincreasingly concerned about the mounting evidencelinking hormone disrupting and bio accumulative chemicalswith negative health effects. Several declarations calling fora precautionary approach to hormone disrupting chemicalshave been signed by doctors and scientists from all overthe world, such as the Prague Declaration on endocrinedisruption in 2005.\nNew scientific insight shows that long-term low-level\nexposure during early life may result in unexpected effects,which only become apparent many years later. Moreover,chemicals can act together in an additive way, andfoetuses and young children are particularly sensitive tochemicals. In this light, the WWF blood testing results fromEuropean families and unborn babies are extremelyworrying and, all the more important, show the need forbetter protection from hazardous chemicals. Alongside the human story, the presence and effects of\nman-made chemicals in wildlife was also the subject ofmany DetoX campaign reports. The WWF Arcticprogramme made key contributions to the DetoX campaignwith two reports on Arctic contamination. Due to thetransport of chemicals via air and water currents the PolarRegions face a high level of pollution despite theirremoteness. A WWF report in 2006 summarized newscientific evidence showing that the presence of man-madechemicals, such as perfluorinated chemicals andorganochlorines, already leads to health effects such asimmune suppression, hormone disturbances or behaviouralchanges in species such as polar bears, beluga whales,seals and sea birds. \nEqually alarming signals from research in other parts of\nEurope were included in the report, carried out together withthe WWF Baltic Programme, Clean Baltic within REACH . It\nconcluded that fish from some areas of the Baltic Sea wereso contaminated that they may be too toxic for EU markets.Scientific news from the Mediterranean Sea reported thefirst detection of a certain type of brominated flameretardants in Mediterranean swordfish off the Italian coast, aWWF DetoX report by WWF Italy in collaboration with theUniversity of Siena showed.\nLeft: Tagging of polar bears to monitor their development.

Continuous scientific work and legal and politicalanalysis allowed DetoX to get the public support oforganisations such as Cascade (the European network ofscientific excellence on chemicals in food), the Women\u2019sInstitute in the UK, the Co-operative Bank, the EuropeanCommunity of Consumer Cooperatives (Eurocoop) and theEPHA (European Public Health Alliance)-EnvironmentNetwork (EEN) for its key initiatives. \nNumerous renowned scientists supported WWF calls to\ntake action on the most hazardous chemicals, particularlythose that persist and accumulate, or can cause cancer, orare toxic to reproduction, or affect DNA or the hormonesystem. These partnerships were crucial for  mediacoverage of DetoX publications and underlined thescientific basis of WWF\u2019s work.Experts from the WHO (World Health Organisation) and\nsome of Europe\u2019s most prestigious universities came to theEuropean Parliament to meet with MEPs. Leading expertssigned open letters to request changes in the draft REACHtext, and specialists in cancer have agreed to take part inWWF press conferences for the launch of the biomonitoringresults. Representatives of Arctic indigenous peoples cameto Brussels with the support of DetoX to explain toMembers of the European Parliament their concerns aboutthe impact of chemical contamination in their daily life. Agroup of ladies from the Women\u2019s Institute from the UK didthe same, following on from their participation in thechemical check up. \nWWF national offices also engaged in partnerships with\nprogressive companies who are keen on promoting saferchemicals for their products and who see REACH as anopportunity for improved innovation and competitiveness inEurope.\nLeft: Representatives of the Arctic Indigenous Peoples, invited by WWF , explained Members of the European Parliament (with Lena  Ek here) the increasing chemical contam-\nination of the Arctic.  |  Bottom left: The Women\u2019s Institute supporting WWF\u2019s call for safer chemicals in front of the Europea n Parliament in Brussels.\nWhat DetoX achieved\nOn the policy side, the DetoX campaign achieved its\ngreatest success by ensuring REACH will mean the start ofa paradigm shift in chemical legislation:\n\u25a0industry will now have to provide safety information andrecommendations for safe uses for all chemicalsproduced or marketed in the EU as from 10 tonnes peryear, thereby placing the burden of  proof on companies.For an estimated 10-30% of chemicals between 1-10t(including all new chemicals) basic safety information willhave to be provided, for the rest only availableinformation will have to be submitted.\n\u25a0Chemicals of very high concern will need anauthorisation and companies will not be allowed tocontinue manufacturing, using or selling chemicals thathave persistent, bio accumulative and toxic properties orvery persistent and very bio accumulative properties ifthere is a safer alternative or if the risks of using thesubstance outweigh the benefits it brings.\n\u25a0A list of the most hazardous chemicals will be publiclyavailable. This will allow retailers and other companies toavoid using and selling such chemicals and allowretailers to insist that their suppliers find \u2013and startusing\u2013 safer alternative chemicals or technologies.\n\u25a0Consumers now have the right to know whether veryhazardous chemicals are present in consumer products.Companies will be required to answer such questionsfrom consumers within 45 days.Due to intensive industry lobbying, REACH still has\nloopholes. This means work must continue for many years.For instance, a review of the authorisation system forhormone disrupting chemicals is scheduled to take place in6 years, in other words 2013. The watch dog function ofthe NGOs will still be important to safeguard theachievements and make sure REACH finally delivers onhuman health and wildlife protection.\nMore generally, the Detox campaign was highly successful\nin changing the debate on industry costs to a debate aboutprotecting wildlife and health. WWF\u2019s blood testing gotunder the skin of decision makers and the public: the issueof chemical contamination cannot be ignored anymore.Due to the change in public awareness we should seeincreased market demand for safer products and othercountries outside the EU starting to copy elements of theREACH legislation.\nThe high media visibility and public success of the\ncampaign helped to move WWF to the centre of theREACH debate. The combination of sustained media workand high level policy and advocacy work carried out overthe last three years has also shone a spotlight on the wideroperations of WWF\u2019s national organisations and that of theWWF European Policy Office in the European Commission,Parliament and Council. This offers enormous benefits toWWF\u2019s ongoing and future work on climate change,forests, species, marine, freshwater and our field projectsaround the world. \nLeft: Polish celebrities engaged in the DetoX Campaign.  |   Right: Polar bear (ursus maritimus) in blue ice. \u00a9WWF-Canon/Wim van Passel.\u00a9 1986 Panda symbol WWF \u2013 World Wide Fund For Nature (Formerly World Wildlife Fund) \u00ae \u201cWWF\u201d and \u201cliving planet\u201d are Registered Trademarks\nFor more information on the DetoX Campaign and REACH please visit:\nhttp://www.panda.org/euOver three years, the DetoX Campaign has benefited from the enthusiasm and commitment\nof the policy and communication experts from WWF national organisations and of its coreteam in Brussels:\nDirectors: Karl Wagner and Sandra Jen\nSenior Toxics Progamme Officers: Michael Warhust and Ninja Reineke\nToxics Programme Officer: Justin Wilkes\nCommunications Managers: Julian Scola and Noemi Cano\nAdvisors on European Parliament Affairs: Elizabeth Drury, Delia Villagrasa, Sandra Jen\nInformation assistants: Suzanne Natelson and Emma Bagyary\ndesign: www.beelzepub.com\u00a9 WWF-Canon / Michel TERRETTAZ.\n\u00a9 WWF-Canon/Sylvia Rubli \n\u00a9 WWF-Canon/Wim van Passel", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
