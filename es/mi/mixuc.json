This provocative statement uttered by troublemaker Price, a young boy attending the history class taught by the narrator Tom Crick in Graham Swift\u2019s 1983 novel Waterland, not only launches the story of Tom\u2019s personal life as it intertwines with the collective history of his homeland, the Fens, in Eastern England. It also metafictionally echoes the by now well-known postmodern theories of critics such as Fredric Jameson and Jean Baudrillard, who equate the postmodern condition with the loss of historical consciousness and the fictionality of history. Within that perspective, the Second World War and the Holocaust, by embodying the limits of representation, come to be seen as the arch temporal marker or historical divider that led to the end of history or, as Dominick LaCapra puts it in Representing the Holocaust, as the \u201ctraumatic point of rupture between modernism and postmodernism\u201d (LaCapra 1994, 188). For him, one is now forever \u201ccaught between an illusory attempt at theoretical or narrative totalization and the compulsive repetition of trauma, double binds, or utter fragmentation\u201d (LaCapra 1994, 194).\n2These interrogations lie at the heart of three literary and cinematic works that were all released in the 1980s: Italian director Ettore Scola\u2019s 1983 silent film Le Bal (Ballando\u2026 Ballando), contemporary British novelist Anita Brookner\u2019s 1985 novel Family and Friends, and British filmmaker Terence Davies\u2019s 1988 film Distant Voices, Still Lives. What is striking in these three works, despite their different textual and visual nature, is not so much their similar narrative techniques, with their use of photographs and stilled images as well as songs and dances, but the way in which they explore the cyclicality or \u201cdance\u201d of history in terms that resonate with the postmodern concepts of trauma and dehistorization.\n3Borrowing from a number of critics of postmodernism as well as poststructuralist theorists of the photograph, this essay will show how, in these three works which explore the notions of temporality, memory, and nostalgia, the photographs, which are used as both narrative device and historical evidence, represent far more than just an attempt at fixating and containing the passing of time. By chronicling the second half of a twentieth century marked by the epistemological rupture of the Second World War\u2014present in all three works\u2014and the Holocaust\u2014barely alluded to, and yet omnipresent, in Brookner\u2019s novel\u2014they provide a view of history which, from then on, can only be apprehended as an endless and meaningless cyclical return, in which the characters, despite the frail or strong cohesion of actual or metaphorical families, seem forever doomed to alienation and utter solitude.\n4Through an original narrative strategy at the frontier between the two semiotic codes of text and image, Anita Brookner\u2019s Family and Friends presents itself in the form of a fictitious family photo-album spanning three successive generations over the course of the twentieth century. The novel starts and ends with a narrator opening, browsing through, and then closing a wedding-photograph album, which enables him or her to chronicle the saga of the Dorns, a family of Jewish exiles who fled the Nazi regime in Germany to find shelter in London, and then in Italy and California for two of its members. As each fictitious photograph is presented through narratorial injunctions inviting the reader to look at pictures rather than read words\u2014although these pictures never materialize and have a purely textual existence\u2014the reader is encouraged to suspend his or her disbelief and welcome this hybrid literary object as a photo album and not a novel: \u201cHere\u2019s Sofka, in a wedding photograph\u201d, reads the first sentence in the novel (FF 7), \u201cHere they are all, family and friends, in the wedding photograph\u201d, reads the first sentence of the very last paragraph (FF 187). The visual journey through the photo-album is carried out by a narrator, or rather a narrative voice, whose repeated authoritative first-person intrusions remain anonymous, and therefore enigmatic, throughout, despite the narrator\u2019s claim to have, or have had, special links with the family presented in the album. The four wedding photographs\u2014all of which staged around the figure of the matriarch, Sofka\u2014which punctuate the text and intermittently \u201cfreeze\u201d the narrative flow before releasing it again constitute, as it were, the temporal and structural pillars on which the narrative stands.\n5The novel opens with a wedding photograph highlighting the matriarchal figure of Sofka Dorn, surrounded by her four children, Mimi, Betty, Frederick and Alfred. After a first chapter mainly dedicated to the description of this inaugural photograph, the central character of the mother, Sofka, and the festivities of the day, the narration takes up again, one by one, the main characters of the photo and follows their respective destinies from childhood to middle age, through the photographic or cinematographic technique known as \u201czooming\u201d or telescopic movement. This technique enables the shift from the panoramic shot of the first photograph to the close-up shot of one particular character, accompanied each time by a change in the point of view. Out of a concern for realism, since the reader is supposed to be leafing through a photo-album spanning some thirty or forty years, each new chapter portrays each new character at a period in his or her life which is different from the one chosen for his or her other brothers and sisters. This device contributes to a large extent to the striking temporal and linear fluidity of the novel, in spite of the apparent fragmentation that the general structure implies. Indeed, the thematic series of the four wedding photographs in chapters one, six, ten, and fourteen provides the narrative with an internal coherence by creating a narrative syntax as well as a temporal continuity, while the narrative itself, through the description that is given of each wedding photograph, gives substance to the fictitious image and prolongs its conditions of existence in a twofold manner. On the one hand, it animates it within its own frame, by describing and giving life to the contents of the image, and on the other hand it \u201cexpands\u201d it, or rather \u201cstretches\u201d it, beyond the limits of its frame, into a space which is outside the picture, that is to say invisible to the viewer. Thus, in Family and Friends, the characters, fixed in the conventional pose of the wedding photograph with which the novel opens, become animated at first, as soon as the picture is taken, and then disperse, all the better to gather again according to their age or function (while remaining within the limits of the frame of the initial picture):\nI have no doubt that once the photograph was taken, and the wedding group dispersed, the festivities took their normal course. I have no doubt that great quantities of delicious food\u2014things in aspic, things in baskets of spun sugar\u2014were consumed, and that the music struck up and the bride and bridegroom danced, oblivious of their guests, and that the elders gathered in groups on their gilt chairs while the children, flushed with too many sweet meals and the lure of the polished parquet floor, ventured forth until restrained by nurses or grandmothers. (FF 9)\n6Then the narrative continues, this time going beyond the spatio-temporal frame of the image it has animated, by focusing on a detail of the picture, the specific character of the mother, Sofka, and transporting it into another narrative space and another narrative time, which constitute what we can call the \u201cnarrative off-screen space\u201d of the inaugural picture. A flashback thus takes us back to the morning before the wedding, when Sofka, surrounded by her children in one of the rooms in her house precisely called the \u201cmorning-room\u201d, is waiting for the car that will drive them to the place of the festivities: \u201cSofka sits in her morning-room, waiting for the car to come round\u201d (FF 16). A few lines further down, after a short description of the scene preceding the arrival of the car, followed by a brief return to the banquet, the narration again prolongs the initial image beyond its frame by once again \u201cremoving\u201d Sofka and showing her at home still, but this time on the day following the wedding: \u201cReflecting, on the following day, Sofka will judge the event a success\u201d (FF 17-18).\n7However\u2014and this is part of the charm of this novel with its accordion-like structure\u2014in both cases (the morning before, and the day after, the wedding), no sooner has the narration gone beyond the limits of its original frame than it becomes contained again within another frame. Indeed, in the first case, on the morning preceding the wedding, the description of Sofka and her children sitting around her echoes the initial wedding picture, and the metaphorical picture that they compose presents remarkable analogies with the opening of the novel (that is to say, the first photograph in the album). Although Sofka is no longer standing but sitting, we can notice the same hieratic pose (\u201cSofka stands straight and stern\u201d, FF 7; \u201cSofka\u2019s back is ramrod straight\u201d, FF 16), the same \u201cbeaded dress\u201d, the same hat, and the same presence of her two daughters, no longer behind her as before (\u201cBehind her stand her two daughters\u201d, FF 7) but this time around her (\u201cAround her sit the girls\u201d, FF 16). Moreover, the fixed, pictorial effect of the scene is reinforced by two references to two artistic domains, painting, with the \u201cPre-Raphaelite dresses\u201d of the young women, and sculpture, with Frederick\u2019s pose which is reminiscent of Leochares\u2019 Apollo Belvedere, as well as by the presence of a double frame, the doorframe where Frederick is standing, representing a frame-within-the-frame: \u201cLounging in the doorway, with the nonchalant stance of the Apollo Belvedere, is Frederick who enjoys these long celebrations [\u2026]\u201d (FF 17).\n- 1 Liliane Louvel in Poetics of the Iconotext describes the reference to a pictorial genre as a case o\n[(...)](#ftn1)\n8This very pictorial description is surprisingly similar to those eighteenth-century \u201cconversation pieces\u201d in the manner of Hogarth, for instance, in which the interest of the painting lies in the fact that the characters who are depicted are not presented as specifically posing.\n[1](#ftn1) Instead, they are shown at home, pottering around or chatting over tea, for example. In our case, the scene takes place in the drawing-room where the characters are depicted waiting for the car that will take them to the wedding, with the eldest son, Frederick, obligingly pouring a glass of Madeira to his mother: \u201cEven now he is pouring his mother a tiny glass of Madeira, placing a small table at her elbow, smiling at her, and very gently teasing her, for she finds these events initially daunting\u201d (FF 17). In the second case, on the day following the wedding, the narration also becomes contained again within a frame, with Sofka apprehending her day as a \u201cperfect picture\u201d, and the pictorial or photographic metaphor, initially used in the first family portrait for narratological purposes\u2014those of the photofiction\u2014can now function fully: \u201cLooking out into the garden, she sees that a wheelbarrow has not been put away. She frowns slightly. How tiresome that so innocent a detail should spoil the perfect picture of her day\u201d (FF 18).\n9Throughout the novel, pictorial descriptions of scenes and characters are indeed presented by the narrator as overtly reminiscent of Pre-Raphaelite paintings, Greek sculptures, or, as above, eighteenth-century \u201cconversation pieces\u201d in the manner of Hogarth, thus enabling this to-and-fro movement of the narration in and outside fixed frames. These metaphorical \u201cpictures\u201d or \u201cpictorial scenes\u201d which also freeze the narrative in time and space thus come to duplicate, at the level of the micro-structure, the formal wedding photographs of the macro-structure through a kind of metonymic shift. This is the case, for instance, of the scene of the Sunday dinner in chapter six, with the roast beef being cut by Alfred, in which the choice of the signifier \u201cpicture\u201d in the narratorial injunction to the reader reinforces the pictorial aspect of the scene, turning it into a veritable \u201ctableau vivant\u201d, to use Liliane Louvel\u2019s terminology (Louvel 2011, 94-96):\nPicture them at the table. Alfred, flourishing carving knives, prepares to exert his patriarchal will on a large roast of beef, for Sunday is devoted to the consumption of traditional English food [\u2026] Alfred sits at the head of the table because Sofka has decided that he deserves this distinction. She herself sits at the foot, and Frederick is on her right, where he prefers to be. (FF 77)\n10This process itself is reinforced by the numerous photographs that the characters exchange in the text, such as the pictures of his children that Frederick sends to his mother from his place of exile in Italy in chapter eleven, or the photographs of Mimi\u2019s wedding in chapter ten, which duplicate the ones that constitute the backbone of the novel. We have therefore a veritable mise en abyme of the narration, in which the description of the image is no longer mediated only by the gaze of the narrator, but also by the focal consciousness of a character who is inside the story, in this case Betty, in exile in the US. Here too, as for the wedding photographs of the macro-structure, the contemplation of the image generates its description by the focalizer, a description which is accompanied, as in chapter one, by a reflection which extends beyond the frame of the image: \u201cBut when the wedding photographs arrive and she sees how astonishingly prosperous Mimi looks in her white dress and with all those flowers, Betty turns thoughtful. She reflects that Mimi seems to be doing very well for herself\u201d (FF 160).\n11The narrative technique of Anita Brookner\u2019s novel Family and Friends, with the inclusion of photographs and fixed frames at the level of both the macro-structure and the micro-structure, recalls the one used by Italian director Ettore Scola in his 1983 motion picture Le Bal (Ballando\u2026 Ballando) which, in order to relate fifty years of French history from the Popular Front in 1936 to the early 1980s, stages couples dancing on the dance-floor of a single ballroom to the sound and rhythm of each different period. In this \u201csilent\u201d film\u2014that is to say without dialogues or an identifiable narrator, but with popular music throughout\u2014the narration is based exclusively on the couples forming and \u201cun-forming\u201d on the dance-floor, and the idylls and dramas that result from these pairings. At the end of each significant period of time, on four different occasions in the film (the German Occupation, the Liberation, the 1950s, and the 1960s), the narration comes to a stop when a camera, invisible since located outside the picture, but still noticeable from its loud flash\u2014the closest photographic equivalent to a strong, textual narratorial intrusion\u2014takes snapshots of the dancers. Each time, the \u201cfreeze frame\u201d thus obtained\u2014with the noticeable absence of the original colours\u2014turns into a black and white photograph which, endowed with a proper frame, comes to hang imposingly on the wall behind the bar of the ballroom, where it represents a veritable mise en abyme of the narration, which can then resume. In this film as in Brookner\u2019s novel, the photographs play the part of fixed frames that contain and freeze both the narration and history, while precisely rendering their ineluctable flow. And as in the novel, these macro-structural frames are also duplicated by smaller frames in the form of the large mirrors that can be seen all around the ballroom, reflecting what is happening on the dance-floor, and serving as a narrative device to introduce us, at the very beginning of the film\u2014once the lights of the ballroom have been switched on\u2014to each single dancer as they make and check their appearance in the mirror and on the stage. These mirrors serve a similar narrative function at the end of the film as each dancer individually leaves the ballroom before the lights go off, thus highlighting even further the perfectly circular structure of the whole. Also reminiscent of Brookner\u2019s narrative technique are the various pictures hanging on the walls of the ballroom or exchanged by the characters.\n- 2 \u201cJe propose donc de nommer \u2018moment ekphrastique\u2019 ce moment du texte occup\u00e9 par l\u2019ekphrasis et qui a\n[(...)](#ftn2)\n- 3 Vito Zagarrio sees this \u201ccircularity\u201d, as well as what he calls the \u201cclaustrophobic location of the\n[(...)](#ftn3)\n- 4 Maria Consuelo Cunha Campos, for her part, talks of \u201cteatrum mundi\u201d and of \u201cdesespero tragic\u00f3mico\u201d\n[(...)](#ftn4)\n12This comparison between the novel Family and Friends and the film Le Bal appears all the more pertinent as the structural parallel that we have just highlighted functions in conjunction with a thematic parallel as well. Indeed, the two novelistic and cinematographic works explore the same metaphor, that of dancing as a symbol of the cyclical nature of time and history following the trauma of the Second World War. In both Brookner\u2019s novel and Scola\u2019s film, these photographs or \u201cstill(ed) lives\u201d, which freeze the movement while paradoxically preserving its dynamic intensity and announcing further intensity to come (very much like Liliane Louvel\u2019s \u201cekphrastic moments\u201d\n[2](#ftn2)), prove to be anamorphic variations on the original matrix endlessly repeated, which, combined with the ongoing round of dances, suggests a cyclical vision of time and history. Through the rotation on the same dance-floor, year after year, of couples played by the very same actors performing the very same functions\u2014the romantic lover, the shady individual, the brute, the generous soul, etc.\u2014for each period of time, the film suggests that, following the epistemological rupture of World War II, history no longer follows a linear, chronological progression according to some teleological purpose, but instead merely repeats itself endlessly, all the more so as most of the dances are actually either choreographed round dancing\u2014with couples dancing the waltz, the polka, the rumba or the rock-and-roll, to name but a few\u2014or circle dancing\u2014with couples alternately exchanging kisses on mock-carpets (a scarf during the Popular Front or a French flag at the Liberation) in the middle of the ring. [3](#ftn3) And although dancing, music and clothing styles change according to fashion and historical periods, along with other details such as newspapers, chewing gum, Coca-Cola bottles or beeping watches (which function as so many \u201cclues\u201d for the spectator), what the film fundamentally emphasizes is the immutability of what Balzac calls \u201cthe Human Comedy\u201d, as well as man\u2019s fundamental solitude: indeed, when the ball comes to an end and the lights go off, not a single dancing couple is shown as leaving together, thus highlighting the failure of any attempt at bonding beyond the limited spatial and temporal boundaries of the ballroom. [4](#ftn4)\n- 5 \u201cAnamorphosis\u201d is the term used in the visual arts to describe the reversal in perspective that occ\n[(...)](#ftn5)\n13In the same way, the novel Family and Friends opens with couples dancing at a wedding (\u201cAt the wedding they will dance, husbands with wives, fathers with daughters\u201d, FF 17), and closes with a promise of further literal or figurative balls: \u201cWait for the dancing to begin\u201d (FF 187). The circular structure of the novel, combined with the recurrence of the weddings and their seemingly endless round of dances, as well as the periodic narrative pauses created by the wedding photographs being taken and then described ekphrastically, contribute to underlinng the cyclical nature or \u201cdance\u201d of history. This phenomenon is all the more striking as a close examination of the photographs faithfully recording these family gatherings reveals that they can all be seen as anamorphic variations\n[5](#ftn5) of the original matrix forever repeated and textually reprinted through a sort of internal rotation, or \u201cdance\u201d, of the protagonists. Indeed, this view of the entire novel as a vast anamorphic process seems convincing if we cease to consider that the narrator is presenting us with several photographs, and if we consider, instead, that he or she is actually showing only one photograph, always the same one, which opens up like a fan from the first page onward, and takes on, throughout the \u201creading-journey\u201d, new appearances. For one must admit that these wedding pictures always deal with the same subject-matter, the family portrait, always present the members of the family in the same position, surrounding the newlyweds, and above all, always present the exact same characters, Sofka, her children, and the rest of the family. Without even mentioning the four children Mimi, Betty, Frederick and Alfred, whose presence is recurrent, we can remark on the reiterated presence of the two half-sisters, Dolly and Nettie, who are explicitly mentioned in the first, third and fourth pictures (FF 8, 136, and 187), and on that of Lilie and Ursie in the last two pictures (FF 136 and 187). The presence of the children in the last row is specified in the first and last pictures (FF 7 and 187), and their interchangeable names (with their diminutives all ending in \u201c-ie\u201d\u2014\u201cSteffie\u201d, \u201cCarrie\u201d, \u201cLaurie\u201d, or \u201cCharlie\u201d) reinforce the impression that they could well be the exact same children in all the photographs. Each picture provides the exact same details, such as the smile on the face of the newlyweds and their family, the faces that try to charm the photographer (third and fourth pictures), and even Sofka\u2019s hats, mentioned on the occasion of each of the three weddings that she attends (the fourth one taking place after her death). The absence of Sofka in the last picture does not, for that matter, contradict what we are saying, for Mimi, her daughter, replaces her. The resemblance between mother and daughter is emphasized by the presence of three details characteristic of the deceased\u2014the upright pose, the lace dress, and the inevitable hat (\u201cMimi, upright, in pale lace, with a rather imposing hat, looks very like her mother\u201d, FF 187). Mimi has taken over the role of the matriarch (\u201cit is Mimi the matriarch\u201d, FF 186), in the same way Alfred is now playing the role relinquished by Frederick (\u201cit is\u2026 Alfred the man of property\u201d, FF 186). And the leitmotiv that we begin to recognize after each new photograph is reinforced by the recurrence, within the narration, of the by now familiar refrain: \u201cHere is\u2026 Here they are....\u201d. The fundamental, immutable structures of the first photograph have thus been respected, and only the faces of the protagonists change through a sort of internal rotation, or dance, in which each character, in turn, comes to occupy the central position of the bride, the bridegroom, the matriarch, the close relative, etc. But it is always fundamentally the same picture which is presented to us, and the successive palimpsestic photographs are merely reproductions, or rather here re-writings, of the first seminal picture, which we may call the \u201cmatrix\u201d, all the more legitimately as it epitomizes, through the character of Sofka, the matriarch par excellence.\n- 6 See also Steve Rose\u2019s comment: \u201cIt\u2019s like a photo album of Britain\u2019s pre-pop culture collective mem\n[(...)](#ftn6)\n- 7 For further reflection on the differences between photography and cinema with respect to stasis, mo\n[(...)](#ftn7)\n14In a strikingly similar manner, Terence Davies\u2019s autobiographical film Distant Voices, Still Lives also uses photographs and stilled images interspersed within the narration to relate the childhood and adolescence of the film director and his brothers and sisters in working-class Liverpool during and after World War II, and also explores, through graphic representations of both the Blitz and domestic violence, the legacy of trauma\u2014in this case the collective trauma of the war and its aftermath, and the individual trauma induced by an abusive father and husband. Like the two works above, the film narrative presents both a circular and a cyclical structure, as it opens and closes (as in Family and Friends) with a wedding\u2014that of the elder sister at the beginning, and that of the brother at the very end\u2014and revolves around recurring photographic stills freezing the narrative flow (or giving the impression thereof, as we shall see). Through a narrative device reminiscent of the loud flash in Le Bal, a distinct \u201cclick\u201d signals a wedding picture being taken at the very beginning of the film, and this initial wedding-picture is then followed by a series of long, silent shots of the lined up family members whose striking photographic quality is, to a large extent, due to their sepia-like colour, \u201ca desaturated brown which comes to signify the past, much as sepia can do in early Lumiere photographs\u201d (Powrie 31) and gives the image \u201cthe feel of a faded photograph\u201d (Koresky 39). The recurrence, within the flow of the narrative, of these stilled images which, as Paul Farvey puts it, \u201cinvoke photography and seem to contain time\u201d (Farley 55), has owed the film the label of cinematic \u201cphoto-album\u201d (Wilson 282),\n[6](#ftn6) a term we have used previously to describe Brookner\u2019s novel. However, the remaining structure of Davies\u2019s film differs slightly from the structure of Scola\u2019s film and Brookner\u2019s novel in that Davies\u2019s \u201cfamily portraits\u201d, as Phil Powrie calls them (Powrie 21), are not proper group portraits, as in the other two works, but \u201cpseudo-photographic images\u201d, \u201cwhen the characters are posing as if for a photograph (Powrie 21, emphasis mine), \u201clooking into the lens as though they are about to have their picture taken\u201d (Koresky 112, emphasis mine). The actual freeze-frame effects of Le Bal are here fake freeze-frame effects, with Davies playing with the notions of stasis and motion, as well as with stasis and time, inherent in photography and film respectively. [7](#ftn7) And yet, like the fictitious wedding-pictures in Brookner\u2019s novel\u2014and as several critics have suggested (Wilson 282; Everett 2005, 193; Koresky 111-112; Di Mattia)\u2014they contribute to create striking \u201ctableaux\u201d\u2014a term we have also used to describe Brookner\u2019s narrative technique\u2014or even pictorial \u201cstill lifes\u201d (Koresky 111), as suggested by the polysemy of the film\u2019s title. Despite this slight formal difference, what is reminiscent of Brookner\u2019s and Scola\u2019s works, though, is the accordion-like structure provided by the alternation of narrative moments and frozen (or pseudo-frozen) images, and reinforced, or duplicated, on the occasion of each significant family gathering (christenings, weddings, and funerals), by the recurring close-up shots of one particular framed photograph\u2014that of the deceased patriarch (Davies\u2019s own late father)\u2014which, like the framed photographs on the ballroom wall in Le Bal, can be seen on the parlour wall. In addition to the many other \u201cframes-within-frames\u201d provided by doors, halls, and windows in the film, this \u201cfurther photographic image within the pseudo-photographic image\u201d, to use Powrie\u2019s words (Powrie 21), recalls the mise en abyme of the narrative that we have highlighted in Le Bal and Family and Friends, with in this case, as an echo of the matriarch Sofka in Brookner\u2019s novel, the deceased patriarch dominating the family, \u201cpresid[ing] over it\u201d (Koresky 38), \u201cthrough his central position in the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne of the photograph\u201d (Powrie 24). Finally, as in Family and Friends and Le Bal, the narrative in Davies\u2019s film is also punctuated by ritualized dances and songs, but while the characters are shown as constantly singing\u2014the director\u2019s attempt at creating his own \u201cmusical\u201d, as he puts it\u2014the dances, which are omnipresent too, are always performed off-camera, and yet intimately connected to the characters, who, in the very words of the patriarch\u2014himself \u201ca very good dancer\u201d\u2014are described as \u201cbleeding dance mad\u201d. Even though they are suggested but not filmed, these dances enhance the circularity of the film, itself described by Davies as presenting \u201cripples of memory\u201d (Davies 295).\n15What is particularly interesting in Distant Voices, Still Lives, as well as illuminating in that it sheds light on the other two works too through the same kind of rippling effect, is the way in which the backdrop of the dances and songs, themselves \u201cshaped by repetition and silence\u201d (Everett 2004, 6), emphasizes, through two very powerful forms of visual arrest, both the recurrence of the frozen filmic images and the cyclical \u201creturn\u201d of the embedded photograph of the violent and abusive father. The choice of the term \u201creturn\u201d is deliberate here for its connection with Freud\u2019s notion of the \u201creturn of the repressed\u201d, as what we have is in fact the visual expression, as well as endless reenactment, of \u201ctraumatic arrest\u201d, as Powrie puts it (Powrie 33), a statement echoed by Koresky, who refers to the stasis of these images as mirroring \u201cthe immobility caused by the lingering of past trauma\u201d (Koresky 112), \u201cthe emotionally crippling effect of a patriarch\u2019s abuse\u201d (Koresky 13). As Wendy Everett states, the \u201cstasis of trauma\u201d in the film (Everett 2005, 193) reveals \u201cthe extent to which the whole family remained traumatized, frozen into immobility and silence, long after [the father\u2019s] death\u201d (Everett 2004, 10-11). In an interview with Michael Koresky, Davies has mentioned how the shooting of the film, and particularly the sequence in which his father is beating up his mother in the hallway, \u201cbrought back really horrid memories of being absolutely terrified\u201d (Koresky 138). For Powrie, this traumatic arrest represents what he calls \u201cthe Law of Death\u201d (Powrie 33), and the family portraits function as the wound, the \u201cdouble trauma\u201d (physical and psychological) of the father \u201cwho is hated because of his violence and the Law which he represents, but who is revered for the same reason\u201d (Powrie 32).\n16If the family, specifically through the abuse committed by his father, is indeed one of the three \u201cloci of trauma\u201d from Davies\u2019s childhood (along with institutionalized suffering and sexuality) which, according to Koresky, are manifest in all his films (Koresky 30), Distant Voices, Still Lives hints at a third \u201clocus of trauma\u201d, i.e. the war, present throughout the first part of the film, set in the 1940s, and whose terrifying reality suddenly irrupts into the film when the three children, out in the streets on an errand, have a narrow escape one day during a Blitz air raid as everybody else at home is running for shelter. Although very short, this intense sequence, as well as its lingering effect on Davies years after the event, attest to its traumatic dimension, highlighting this palpable \u201cfree-floating anxiety\u201d creating an \u201cemotional estrangement between the self and the environment, and between time and place\u201d which, according to Deleuze, is characteristic of postwar filmmaking (Deleuze 272, qtd. in Koresky 115). Koresky sees a manifestation of these \u201ctraumatizing ghosts haunting their maker [Davies]\u201d (Koresky 116) in the \u201cghostlike\u201d beginning of the film (Koresky 114), when the empty house seems haunted by the memory of the family members\u2019 presence. Just like Brookner\u2019s Family and Friends and Scola\u2019s Le Bal, Distant Voices, Still Lives\u2014as reflected in the very caesura of its title\u2014suggests, rather than stages, the epistemological rupture of the Second World War and the terrors and traumas it induced.\n- 8 In her article \u201cDan\u00e7ando sobre um vulc\u00e3o: O baile, o fim de festa\u201d, with its indirect reference to\n[(...)](#ftn8)\n17In both Brookner\u2019s novel and Scola\u2019s and Davies\u2019s films, the endless recurrence of the dances and the photographs seem therefore to point to a vision of history as forever cyclical after a certain moment in time which, in all three cases, corresponds to the late 1930s with the rise of fascism and its culmination in World War II and the Holocaust. One might be tempted to see in the repetitive pattern of both the novel and the films a manifestation of what Dominick LaCapra, in Representing the Holocaust, calls \u201cthe return of the historically repressed\u201d (LaCapra 1994, 169). In this book, LaCapra presents modern history as essentially \u201ctraumatic\u201d, echoing Lawrence Langer\u2019s comment on the Holocaust as being a \u201ccommunal wound that cannot heal\u201d (Langer 204-205).\n[8](#ftn8) The danger, according to LaCapra, is that this \u201ctraumatic point of rupture between modernism and postmodernism\u201d (LaCapra 1994, 188) that the Holocaust represents induces a \u201cdiscourse of trauma\u201d that endlessly enacts a \u201ccompulsive repetition of trauma\u201d (LaCapra 1994, 194) and ultimately threatens to \u201cgenerate aporias\u201d (LaCapra 1994, 221). Following this interpretation, the repetitive temporality of history in Brookner\u2019s Family and Friends might precisely be the symptom of the endless return of the trauma of the Holocaust, here not just psychologically, but also textually or narratively repressed. Indeed, if, to the dismay of some critics like Bryan Cheyette in Contemporary Jewish Writing in Britain and Ireland, the word \u201cHolocaust\u201d itself is hardly ever mentioned in Brookner\u2019s fiction, despite her direct autobiographical connection with these events as the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Poland, the Jewish genocide provides nonetheless a backdrop for most of her novels, and especially this one, but always in a covert, one might say \u201crepressed\u201d, mode. For example, in Family and Friends, a most elliptical dialogue at the beginning of chapter 8 between the matriarch, Sofka, and a woman who just rang her doorbell (\u201cYour children?\u201d \u201cSafe. Here\u201d, FF 99) is the only direct allusion to the horrifying events in the entire novel.\n- 9 \u201cFor her husband, their father, is absent, gone before, dead, mildly disgraced. Gambling, they say.\n[(...)](#ftn9)\n18However, one might precisely see in these recurrent photographs of Holocaust survivors the inscription, or rather \u201cencryption\u201d, of the compulsively repetitive trace of this fundamental trauma, the photographs thus becoming those \u201cmemory sites\u201d, to borrow Pierre Nora\u2019s expression, that LaCapra re-appropriates as \u201ctrauma sites\u201d (LaCapra 1998, 10) or even \u201cmourning sites\u201d (LaCapra 1998, 44) in his book History and Memory after Auschwitz. In this respect, Brookner\u2019s novel might function according to a pattern of repression that LaCapra sees as fundamentally postmodern. The photograph, which, by nature, is evidence that \u201c\u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9\u201d, \u201cthat-has-been\u201d, as Barthes puts it in Camera Lucida (Barthes 120), ends up losing its quality of presence-within-an-absence to emphasize solely, in Brookner\u2019s fiction, absence and death, and particularly the absence of the father.\n[9](#ftn9) But beyond the quest for the missing father, the recurrence of the photographs as traces of the past in Brookner\u2019s Family and Friends might be a manifestation of what LaCapra calls a \u201ccompulsive and melancholic acting-out\u201d (LaCapra 1994, 14) of trauma in which the wedding photographs forever projecting an institutionalized picture of order and harmony could also be seen as a screen barring access to, while giving evidence of, the repressed trauma of the Holocaust, and thus preventing a \u201cworking-through\u201d of that trauma.\n19At a further level, one might see a manifestation of that same compulsion of repetition at work not just in the recurrence of the photographs in Family and Friends, but in the recurrence of Brookner\u2019s novels themselves\u2014twenty-four at the rate of one a year for two decades\u2014to the dismay and delight of both her critics and readers. It all works as if Brookner, through her prolific activity as a fiction writer, kept \u201cacting out\u201d the traumatic past of Jewish Diaspora and relocation without ever \u201cworking it through\u201d, in other words without ever achieving any kind of closure. In any case, whether the traumatic past has to do with the Holocaust, as in Family and Friends, or more generally with World War II and the human misery it caused, both individually and collectively, as in Le Bal and Distant Voices, Still Lives, the endless rotation of the dancers in familial or institutional ballrooms seems to represent an apt metaphor for this never-ending \u201cacting out\u201d of trauma.", "language": null, "image": "https://www.openedition.org/docannexe/image/14283/polysemes_281x600.png", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["#nav",
