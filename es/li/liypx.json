In the former case, angioedema can be caused by allergic reactions caused by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to foods or drugs that can also result in acute urticaria or a more generalized anaphylactic reaction. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitors, in particular) may cause angioedema with or without urticaria, and leukotrienes may have a particular role as a mediator of the swelling. Reactions to contrast agents resemble allergy with basophil and mast cell degranulation in the absence of specific IgE antibody and can be generalized, that is, anaphylactoid. Angioedema accompanies chronic urticaria in 40% of patients, and approximately half have an autoimmune mechanism in which there is IgG antibody directed to the subunit of the IgE receptor (40%) or to IgE itself (5%-10%). Bradykinin is the mediator of angioedema in hereditary angioedema types I and II (C1 inhibitor [INH] deficiency) and the newly described type III disorder some of which are caused bya mutation involving factor XII. Acquired C1 INH deficiency presents in a similar fashion to the hereditary disorder and is due either toC1 INH depletion by circulating immune complexes or to an IgG antibody directed to C1 INH. Although each of these causes excessive bradykinin formation because of activation of the plasma bradykinin-forming pathway, the angioedema due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is caused by excessive bradykinin levels due to inhibition of bradykinin degradation. Idiopathic angioedema (ie, pathogenesis unknown) may be histaminergic, that is, caused by mast cell degranulation with histamine release, or nonhistaminergic. The mediator pathways in the latter case are yet to be defined. A minority may be associated with the same autoantibodies associated with chronic urticaria.

We herein describe a case of 25-year-old male who presented with swelling over face since one day. There was history of similar episodes since two years with gradual subsidence of swelling without any treatment. Investigations revealed grossly reduced complement C4 and C1 esterase inhibitor level. Patient was diagnosed to have hereditary angioedema type 1 and started on stanozolol 2 mg three times a day with no recurrence in one year of follow-up. Hereditary angioedema resembles angioedema of an allergic reaction. However, the cause is different.

C1INH is the main inhibitor of the contact system. Poor control of a local activation process of this system at the site of the attack is believed to lead to the formation of bradykinin (BK), which increases local vasopermeability and mediates angioedema on interaction with BK receptor 2 on the endothelium. However, several observations in patients with HAE are difficult to explain from a pathogenic model claiming a local activation process at the site of the angioedema attack. Therefore we postulate an alternative model for angioedema attacks in patients with HAE, which assumes a systemic, fluid-phase activation of the contact system to generate BK and its breakdown products. Interaction of these peptides with endothelial receptors that are locally expressed in the affected tissues rather than with receptors constitutively expressed by the endothelium throughout the whole body explains that such a systemic activation process results in local manifestations of an attack. In particular, BK receptor 1, which is induced on the endothelium by inflammatory stimuli, such as kinins and cytokines, meets the specifications of the involved receptor. The pathogenic model discussed here also provides an explanation for why angioedema can occur at multiple sites during an attack and why HAE attacks respond well to modest increases of circulating C1INH activity levels because inhibition of fluid-phase Factor XIIa and kallikrein requires lower C1INH levels than inhibition of activator-bound factors.

These reactions are documented for several cardiac medications including blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Other cardiovascular and diabetes medications further increase the risk of medication-induced angioedema, particularly with concomitant use of RAAS inhibitors. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors are a class of oral diabetic agents that affect bradykinin and substance P degradation and therefore can lead to angioedema. Neprilysin inhibitors are a separate class of cardiac medications, which includes sacubitril, and can lead to drug-induced angioedema especially when used in combination with RAAS inhibitors. This article discusses the proposed mechanisms by which these medications cause angioedema and how medication-induced angioedema differs from mast cell-mediated angioedema. It also details how to recognize medication-induced angioedema and the treatment options available. Copyright \u00a9 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We reviewed the case records of all patients at our office from January 1997 to April 2013. We recorded sex, age, age at onset of symptoms, family history of angioedema, number of visits to the office, type of angioedema, and response to treatment from those patients with angioedema without wheals. We classified angioedema according to its pathophysiology. We also describe those patients with angioedema mimics. From a total of 17,823 new patients, 303 had a presumptive diagnosis of angioedema without wheals. Twenty-three patients had an angioedema mimic. Forty percent were male and 60% were female. Average age at first visit was 40.6. Average number of visits was 2.4. Fifty-seven patients referred a family history. We attributed idiopathic angioedema to 55.7% of patients, 24.3% were drug related, 15.7% were due to C1 inhibitor deficiency, 2.1% were drug related+idiopathic angioedema, 1.4% were type III and 0.7% had exercise-induced angioedema. Ninety six percent of 53 evaluable idiopathic angioedema patients referred a benefit with anti-histamine therapy. AWW was a rare cause of consultation. Most of our patients had anti H1 responsive idiopathic angioedema and none had allergic angioedema. Women cases prevailed over men's. Family history and average age of onset of symptoms were different among the different types of angioedema.\n[[Hereditary angioedema: a therapeutic revolution].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22227095)\nBouillet, L\n2012-03-01\nHereditary angioedema is a rare disease, often diagnosed with delay because of a heterogeneous clinical presentation. Before diagnosis, patients frequently present subcutaneous edema or abdominal pains during many years. Laryngeal edema can be life-threatening. Hereditary angioedema may impair the quality of life of the patients and their social and professional life. It is important that the physicians recognize and treat the disease as soon as possible after the first attacks. Since the past five years, new drugs developed for hereditary angioedema have changed dramatically the outcome of this disorder. The objective of this review is to detail the new therapeutic guidelines. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale fran\u00e7aise de m\u00e9decine interne (SNFMI). Published by Elsevier SAS.

The patient developed angioedema 20-30 minutes after eating chicken meat with cheddar cheese. There was no history of allergy. Oral food challenge (OFC) with both cheddar cheese and chicken meat was negative. Skin tests for inhalant allergens were negative. 3 weeks later, the patient was admitted with angioedema after drinking sage tea. OFC with sage was applied and angioedema was observed. It was recognized that the first trigger, chicken meat with cheddar cheese, included oregano (Origanum onites L.). OFC for oregano was positive. Prick to prick test for Lamiaceae herbs (oregano, sage, mint) was performed. A positive reaction was observed only to mint. OFC was repeated with fresh mint and angioedema developed after 16 hours. Diagnose of Lamiaceae allergy is complicated and cross-sensitivity is common. Skin prick test (prick to prick)revealed a positive response only to mint but not to oregano and sage. Commercial radioallergosorbent (RAST) tests are available only for a few members of the family. Finally, thediagnose is based mainly on OFC. Spices from Lamiaceae group should be considered as potential triggers of allergic reactions.\n[Brazilian guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hereditary angioedema.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22179171)\nGiavina-Bianchi, Pedro; Fran\u00e7a, Alfeu T; Grumach, Anete S; Motta, Ab\u00edlio A; Fernandes, F\u00e1tima R; Campos, Regis A; Valle, Solange O; Ros\u00e1rio, Nelson A; Sole, Dirceu\n2011-01-01\nHereditary angioedema is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by edema attacks with multiple organ involvement. It is caused by a quantitative or functional deficiency of the C1 inhibitor, which is a member of the serine protease inhibitor family. Hereditary angioedema is unknown to many health professionals and is therefore an underdiagnosed disease. The causes of death from hereditary angioedema include laryngeal edema with asphyxia. The estimated mortality rate in patients in whom the disease goes undetected and who are therefore incorrectly treated is 25-40%. In addition to edema of the glottis, hereditary angioedema often results in edema of the gastrointestinal tract, which can be incapacitating. Patients with hereditary angioedema may undergo unnecessary surgical interventions because the digestive tract can be the primary or only organ system involved, thus mimicking acute surgical abdomen. It is estimated that patients with hereditary angioedema experience some degree of disability 20-100 days per year. The Experts in Clinical Immunology and Allergy of the \"Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Alergia e Imunopatologia -ASBAI\" developed these guidelines for the diagnosis, therapy, and management of hereditary angioedema.\n[Angioedema Spotlight: A Closer Examination of Sacubitril/Valsartan Safety Results.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28720639)\nOwens, Ryan E; Oliphant, Carrie S\n2017-01-01\nIncorporation of neprilysin inhibition into heart failure pharmacotherapy regimens has recently been recommended by U.S. guidelines, based on results from the PARADIGM-HF trial comparing sacubitril/valsartan to enalapril. While most of the discussion has focused on efficacy, a closer examination of the safety results, particularly the incidence of angioedema during the run-in and double-blind periods, is also warranted. Although no major safety concerns were identified, an angioedema risk comparable to enalapril was found, primarily in the black population. Therefore, despite combination with an angiotensin receptor blocker, which historically has a lower incidence of angioedema, the addition of neprilysin inhibition yields an angioedema risk profile comparable to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Clinicians should recognize this safety risk when prescribing sacubitril/valsartan and remain vigilant in counseling patients regarding the signs and symptoms of angioedema. As recommended by the guidelines, avoiding sacubitril/valsartan use concurrently or within 36 hours of the last dose of an ACE inhibitor or in patients with a history of angioedema is also crucial to minimize angioedema risk and prevent patient harm. \u00a9 Copyright 2017 by the American Board of Family Medicine.\n[Bowel Angioedema Associated With Iodinated Contrast Media: Incidence and Predisposing Factors.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28368879)\nSeo, Nieun; Chung, Yong Eun; Lim, Joon Seok; Song, Mi Kyung; Kim, Myeong-Jin; Kim, Ki Whang\n2017-09-01\nBowel angioedema is an acute adverse reaction to iodinated contrast media (CM) that involves the gastrointestinal tract. We aimed to investigate the incidence and predisposing factors of iodinated CM-associated bowel angioedema during computed tomography (CT) examinations. This study was approved by our institutional review board, and informed consent was waived due to its retrospective design. From July 2013 to July 2015, adult patients with a history of adverse reactions to iodinated CM during CT (group A, n = 427) and patients without adverse reactions matched for age and sex with the propensity-score matching method (group B, n = 427) were studied. Contrast media-associated bowel angioedema was determined when bowel wall thickness increased after contrast enhancement compared with the precontrast scan. Potential predisposing factors including patient demographics, symptoms and time of adverse reactions, and CM-related factors were compared between patients with and without angioedema in group A. In addition, the incidence of bowel angioedema was compared between groups A and B. The incidence of CM-associated bowel angioedema in group A was 3.3% (14/427) in the per-patient analysis and 2.6% (15/578) in the per-examination analysis. The CM-associated bowel angioedema involved the distal duodenum and/or proximal jejunum and showed long-segmental circumferential bowel wall thickening on CT. None of the studied predisposing factors was different between patients with and without bowel angioedema (P > 0.05). The incidence of CM-associated bowel angioedema in group B was 1.9% (8/427) and 1.7% (8/458) for per-patient and per-examination analyses, respectively, and these rates were not significantly different between groups A and B (P = 0.346 and P = 0.370, respectively). The incidence of CM-associated bowel angioedema during CT was 1.7% to 3.3%, and none of the studied predisposing factors was associated with bowel angioedema.\n[Antihypertensive drug associated angioedema: effect modification by race/ethnicity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28722207)\nReichman, Marsha E; Wernecke, Michael; Graham, David J; Liao, Jiemin; Yap, John; Chillarige, Yoganand; Southworth, Mary Ross; Keeton, Stephine; Goulding, Margie R; Mott, Katrina; Kelman, Jeffrey A\n2017-10-01\nAssess angioedema risk with exposure to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) compared with beta-blockers, by race/ethnicity. New-user cohorts of Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older initiating ACEI, ARB, or beta-blocker treatment from March 2007 to March 2014 were constructed. Angioedema incidence rates by drug and race/ethnicity were computed for 1-30 and 31-365 days of treatment. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine angioedema risk between cohorts. Angioedema incidence rates (per 1000 person years) in beta-blocker users were 1.80 (whites), 4.11 (blacks), 1.89 (Asians), and 2.10 (Hispanics); in ACEI users, 4.03, 23.77, 2.94, and 4.27; and in ARB users, 1.73, 3.11, 1.10, and 1.90, respectively. Incidence rates were significantly higher in the first 30 days of exposure for all drug \u00d7 race/ethnic groups. Overall, angioedema risk increased among ACEI users (hazard ratio, 2.91; 95% confidence interval, 2.75-3.07) but not ARB users (0.93, 0.85-1.02) versus beta-blocker users. Angioedema risk with ACEIs versus beta-blockers increased more in blacks (6.28, 5.44-7.24) than whites (2.33, 2.19-2.48), Hispanics (2.04, 1.36-3.07), and Asians (1.48, 0.94-2.35). Compared with white beta-blocker users, angioedema risk was increased 2.9-fold in whites, 20.2-fold in blacks, and 2.3-fold in other race/ethnic groups combined during the first 30 days of ACEI exposure. There was significant effect modification of angioedema risk by race and ACEI use for blacks, but not for other race/ethnicity groups. Angioedema risk was significantly greater in the first 30 days of exposure for all, and highest among blacks.

We tested the hypothesis that patients with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema present during months when pollen counts are increased. Cohort analysis examined the month of presentation of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema and pollen counts in the ambulatory and hospital setting. Patients with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema were ascertained through (1) an observational study of patients presenting to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, (2) patients presenting to the Marshfield Clinic and participating in the Marshfield Clinic Personalized Medicine Research Project, and (3) patients enrolled in The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET). Measurements include date of presentation of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema, population exposure to ACE inhibitor by date, and local pollen counts by date. At Vanderbilt, the rate of angioedema was significantly associated with tree pollen months (P = .01 from \u03c7(2) test). When separate analyses were conducted in patients with a history of seasonal allergies and patients without, the rate of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema was increased during tree pollen months only in patients with a history of seasonal allergies (P = .002). In Marshfield, the rate of angioedema was significantly associated with ragweed pollen months (P = .025). In ONTARGET, a positive trend was observed between the ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema rate and grass season, although it was not statistically significant (P = .057). Patients with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema are more likely to present with this adverse drug event during months when pollen counts are increased.

It should be noted that in ancient times, human diseases were very often regarded a punishment from God. Hence, it is not surprising that one of the oldest tests for infidelity involved swelling as an inflicted punishment. The great Greek physician Hippocrates (377-460 BC), considered one of the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine and \"Father of the Western Medicine,\" already used the term o\u00edd\u0113ma to describe swelling of organs. It took many centuries later until the first description of angioedema as a distinct medical entity was minted by Quinke in 1882. The historical progression in angioedema research has been characterized by intermittent \"leaps\" in interest and scientific achievements. As an example, it took 75 years from the accurate description of hereditary angioedema (HAE) by Osler (1888), until a group of researchers headed by Donaldson (1963) disclosed the central role of C1 inhibitor in angioedema pathophysiology. What followed was a result of a collective effort by many researchers and scientific groups who were able to elucidate the intricate connections between the implicated biochemical pathways. Still, scientific progress was hardly translated into effective therapy, and another 45 years had to elapse until the renewed interest in HAE was boosted by studies on the efficacy and safety of novel therapies about 10 years ago. In the twenty-first century, HAE ceased to be an \"orphan disease\" and its future is far more optimistic. It is better managed now by specialized angioedema centers, harmonized clinical guidelines, educational programs, laboratory services, and continued basic and clinical research. Patient associations worldwide are offering support and guidance, and governments and healthcare systems are gradually addressing patient and family needs.\n[Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor use associated with increased risk of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19581505)\nBrown, Nancy J; Byiers, Stuart; Carr, David; Maldonado, Mario; Warner, Barbara Ann\n2009-09-01\nDipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors decrease degradation of the incretins. DPP-IV inhibitors also decrease degradation of peptides, such as substance P, that may be involved in the pathogenesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema. This study tested the hypothesis that DPP-IV inhibition affects risk of clinical angioedema, by comparing the incidence of angioedema in patients treated with the DPP-IV inhibitor vildagliptin versus those treated with comparator in Phase III randomized clinical trials. Prospectively defined angioedema-related events were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an internal medicine adjudication committee and expert reviewer. Concurrent ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker exposure was ascertained from case report forms. Study drug exposure was ascertained from unblinded data from phase III studies. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals comparing angioedema risk in vildagliptin-treated and comparator-treated patients were calculated for the overall population and for patients taking ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, using both an analysis of pooled data and a meta-analysis (Peto method). Overall, there was no association between vildagliptin use and angioedema. Among individuals taking an ACE inhibitor, however, vildagliptin use was associated with an increased risk of angioedema (14 confirmed cases among 2754 vildagliptin users versus 1 case among 1819 comparator users: odds ratio 4.57 [95% confidence interval 1.57 to 13.28]) in the meta-analysis. Vildagliptin use may be associated with increased risk of angioedema among patients taking ACE inhibitors, although absolute risk is small. Physicians confronted with angioedema in a patient taking an ACE inhibitor and DPP-IV inhibitor should consider this possible drug-drug interaction.\n[Gastrointestinal manifestations of hereditary angioedema diagnosed by ultrasound in the emergency department.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25493123)\nRiguzzi, Christine; Losonczy, Lia; Teismann, Nathan; Herring, Andrew A; Nagdev, Arun\n2014-11-01\nAbdominal angioedema is a less recognized type of angioedema, which can occur in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). The clinical signs may range from subtle, diffuse abdominal pain and nausea, to overt peritonitis. We describe two cases of abdominal angioedema in patients with known HAE that were diagnosed in the emergency department by point-of-care (POC) ultrasound. In each case, the patient presented with isolated abdominal complaints and no signs of oropharyngeal edema. Findings on POC ultrasound included intraperitoneal free fluid and bowel wall edema. Both patients recovered uneventfully after receiving treatment. Because it can be performed rapidly, requires no ionizing radiation, and can rule out alternative diagnoses, POC ultrasound holds promise as a valuable tool in the evaluation and management of patients with HAE.\n[Dental experience and self-perceived dental care needs of patients with angioedema.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11795449)\nLodi, G; Sardella, A; Bez, C; Demarosi, F; Cicardi, M; Carrassi, A\n2001-01-01\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the self-perceived dental care needs and dental experiences of patients with angioedema. At the 1998 annual meeting of the Voluntary Association for the Fight, Study and Treatment of Hereditary Angioedema (\"Associazione volontaria per la lotta, lo studio e la terapia dell'angioedema ereditario\"), a self-administered questionnaire was distributed to participants affected by hereditary or acquired angioedema. Fifty-seven persons completed the questionnaire (37 females, 20 males; mean age, 39 +/- 17 yrs; range, 5-76). The vast majority (91%) had the hereditary form of the disease. One-third of the respondents had some problems in obtaining oral treatment, with one person having been refused care. About half of the group had experienced an acute attack following dental treatment. Preventive measures needed improvement in about two-thirds of respondents. More than half (58%) of the group perceived a need for dental care. We conclude that persons with angioedema may experience difficulty in obtaining dental treatment, a common cause of acute attacks.\n[Snoring-Induced Vibratory Angioedema](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4597856)\nKalathoor, Ipe\n2015-01-01\nPatient: Female, 70 Final Diagnosis: Snoring induced vibratory angioedema Symptoms: Swelling of tongue \u2022 roof of mouth and throat \u2022 multiple episodes at night Medication: \u2014 Clinical Procedure: Continuous positive airway pressure therapy Specialty: Allergology Objective: Rare disease Background: Vibratory angioedema (VA) is a rare physical urticaria, with symptoms of itching and swelling of the skin or mucosa when it is exposed to vibration. Avoidance of vibration is the best way to manage this condition. This case report will assist physicians to diagnose this rare condition. Here, a previously unpublished potential successful treatment modality is being presented, with good symptom control, along with some photographs taken during an acute attack. A literature review points towards potential undiagnosed cases. Case Report: A 70-year-old woman had multiple emergency department visits for tongue and throat swelling over 3 years. The episodes always happened at night. Detailed history elicited some episodes of itching and swelling of hands when driving as well as significant snoring while sleeping. Physical examination was unremarkable except for morbid obesity. Complement factor 4 and C1esterase inhibitor level were within normal limits. A tentative diagnosis of angioedema induced by oropharyngeal vibration from snoring was made. A sleep study confirmed sleep apnea with severe snoring. After CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) treatment, she had successful symptom control. Conclusions: Snoring-induced VA is very likely an under-diagnosed condition in the community. The typical history is the key to the diagnosis. This condition could be confirmed by vibration test or by the resolution of symptoms with elimination of vibration. Effective symptom control is possible by avoidance of oropharyngeal vibration from snoring with the administration of CPAP therapy, making it a potential novel indication for this condition.

It can develop due to trauma, vascular abnormalities, and coagulopathy. Due to its sudden development, it can be clinically confused with angioedema. In patients who applied to the doctor with complaints of a swollen tongue, lingual hematoma can be confused with angioedema, in particular, at the beginning if the symptoms occurred after drug use. It should especially be considered that dystonia in the jaw can present as drug-induced hyperkinetic movement disorder. Early recognition of this rare clinical condition and taking precautions for providing airway patency are essential. In this case report, we will discuss mimicking angioedema and caused by a bite due to dystonia and separation of the tongue from the base of the mouth developing concurrently with lingual hematoma.

Angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors are widely known to cause angioedema but less is known about the association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (gliptins) and angioedema. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors are anti-diabetic drugs used to improve glycaemic control. They, as a class effect, inadvertently affect the degradation of the vasoactive kinins bradykinin and substance P, both of which can cause angioedema due to vasodilatation and increase in vascular permeability in the capillaries. Objective To assess the risk and pathomechanism of angioedema due to inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors when used as monotherapy and in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors. Method PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PubMed Central, Web of Science, Google Scholar and clinicaltrials.gov were searched using different combinations of keywords \"angioedema\", \"dipeptidyl peptidase 4\", \"dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors\", \"gliptins\", \"bradykinin\", \"substance P\" and \"angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors\". Original research papers were preferably used as references and their bibliographies were used to further the search for original research results. Results Both angiotensin converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 are major enzymes in the degradation pathway of bradykinin and substance P, and when inhibited pharmacologically - especially at the same time - the theoretical risk of angioedema is increased due to accumulation of vasoactive kinins. Conclusion Treatment with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors must be carefully considered and monitored especially during concurrent treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors or when treating patients with a known predisposition to angioedema.

Sporadic cases of angioedema secondary to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have been reported in the literature. The overall incidence is around 0.1% to 0.2%, and the time of onset is usually during the first week of ACEI therapy. Late-onset angioedema secondary to treatment with ACEIs is much more frequent than appreciated, and is largely unrecognized because of the absence of temporal correlation between ACEI therapy and the development of angioedema. Since angioedema may progress to upper airway obstruction, otolaryngologists must be aware of this association. Most importantly, late-onset angioedema should alert the clinician to discontinue the ACEI immediately to prevent further morbidity. This report presents an example of late-onset angioedema which was precipitated by taking a double dose of captopril incidentally. The case is discussed, and the literature, pathophysiology and treatment of angioedema are reviewed.\n[Lesson of the month 2: The limitations of steroid therapy in bradykinin-mediated angioedema attacks.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25650214)\nIsmail, Sharif; Cheng, Leo; Grigoriadou, Sofia; Laffan, James; Menon, Manoj\n2015-02-01\nAcute angioedema attacks are conventionally treated with antihistamines and steroids, in line with a presumed mechanism of disease involving overwhelming mast-cell degranulation. This approach overlooks a small but important minority of cases in which attacks are bradykinin driven and exhibit poor responsiveness to steroid or anti-histamine therapy. These patients may have a family history of angioedema (hereditary angioedema), or a past medical history including B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders or autoimmune disease (acquired angioedema). Rather than steroid therapy, they respond to administration of a bradykinin inhibitor, or more commonly, a C1 esterase inhibitor substitute, to control acute symptoms and reduce the probability of invasive airway insertion. In the long-term, they require C1 esterase inhibitor sparing therapy and a treat-the-cause approach to reduce the risk of recurrent attacks. We present here a case of a middle-aged woman who presented with recurrent angioedema of initially uncertain aetiology. \u00a9 2015 Royal College of Physicians.\n[Comparison of Clinical Factors Between Patients With Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor-Induced Angioedema and Cough.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27889699)\nHallberg, P\u00e4r; Nagy, Julia; Karawajczyk, Malgorzata; Nordang, Leif; Islander, Gunilla; Norling, Pia; Johansson, Hans-Erik; K\u00e4mpe, Mary; Hugosson, Svante; Yue, Qun-Ying; Wadelius, Mia\n2017-04-01\nAngioedema is a rare and serious adverse drug reaction (ADR) to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment. Dry cough is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors and has been identified as a possible risk factor for angioedema. We compared characteristics between patients with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema and cough with the aim of identifying risk factors that differ between these adverse events. Data on patients with angioedema or cough induced by ACE inhibitors were collected from the Swedish database of spontaneously reported ADRs or from collaborating clinicians. Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fisher's exact test, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were used to test for between-group differences. The significance threshold was set to P <0.00128 to correct for multiple comparisons. Clinical characteristics were compared between 168 patients with angioedema and 121 with cough only. Smoking and concomitant selective calcium channel blocker treatment were more frequent among patients with angioedema than cough: OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 2.1-8.9, P = 2.2 \u00d7 10 -5 , and OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 2.0-7.0, P = 1.7 \u00d7 10 -5 . Angioedema cases were seen more often in male patients (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.4-3.6, P = 1.3 \u00d7 10 -4 ) and had longer time to onset and higher doses than those with cough ( P = 3.2 \u00d7 10 -10 and P = 2.6 \u00d7 10 -4 ). A multiple model containing the variables smoking, concurrent calcium channel blocker treatment, male sex, and time to onset accounted for 26% of the variance between the groups. Smoking, comedication with selective calcium channel blockers, male sex, and longer treatment time were associated with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema rather than cough.\n[Risperidone induced angioedema with concurrent EPS symptoms: a case report and review of literature](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=5906767)\nSamra, Gursharan Singh; Kant, Saumitra; Chow, Robert\n2018-01-01\nABSTRACT Angioedema has recently been reported as a side effect associated with the antipsychotic risperidone. We report a case of dystonia with concurrent angioedema due to risperidone. A 40-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia was started on 3 mg of risperidone BID and developed perioral and periorbital edema along with increased muscle rigidity and hand tremor within 24 h of initial administration. His symptoms abated after cessation of risperidone and intravenous administration of corticosteroids and antihistamine. This case study adds to the current literature, which has already established angioedema as a dose-dependent side effect of risperidone. Moreover, this case study aims to increase awareness about the potential for the simultaneous occurrence of angioedema and extrapyramidal symptoms, and promotes vigilance among prescribers so that the life-threatening consequences of such effects can be avoided.

The incidence has been increasing in the past two decades, primarily due to increased use of medications inhibiting the degradation of vasoactive peptides. Acquired angioedema related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI-AAE) is well known, but other pharmaceutical agents also affect the degradation of bradykinin and substance P. We present a middle-aged man with recurrent episodes of severe AE of the oral cavity, hypopharynx and larynx due to pharmacological inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV. 2017 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.\n[Angioedema in heart failure patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) or enalapril in the PARADIGM-HF study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29776559)\nShi, Victor; Senni, Michele; Streefkerk, Hendrik; Modgill, Vikas; Zhou, Wenchun; Kaplan, Allen\n2018-08-01\nPARADIGM-HF demonstrated significant clinical benefits for sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696, an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor) versus the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) enalapril in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. As inhibition of ACE, and co-inhibition of ACE and neprilysin, may increase the risk of angioedema, this was an adverse event of special interest. Following sequential enalapril and sacubitril/valsartan run-ins, patients were randomized to twice-daily sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg or enalapril 10 mg. The study design incorporated two wash-out periods (~36 h each) to minimize any potential risk of angioedema due to overlapping ACE and neprilysin inhibition. Suspected cases of angioedema were reported to, and blindly adjudicated by, an independent angioedema adjudication committee (AAC). Of the 10,513 patients entering the enalapril run-in, 9419 entered the sacubitril/valsartan run-in and 8432 received double-blind treatment. Overall, 148 suspected angioedema events occurring in 144 patients were reported to AAC, with one event reported during screening period. Of the remaining 147 events, 54 were confirmed as angioedema by AAC. A confirmed event was experienced by 15 (0.14%) and 10 (0.11%) patients, during the enalapril and sacubitril/valsartan run-ins, respectively, and by 10 (0.24%) and 19 (0.45%) patients in the corresponding randomized arms during the double-blind phase. The frequency of confirmed angioedema was higher in black patients. Most events were mild. Only five patients required hospitalization and none required mechanical airway support. The number of confirmed angioedema events in PARADIGM-HF was low and there was no-marked excess risk of angioedema with sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril. Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

The World Allergy Organization (WAO), recognizing the importance of these diseases, has contributed to previous guidelines for the diagnosis and management of urticaria. The Scientific and Clinical Issues Council of WAO proposed the development of this global Position Paper to further enhance the clinical management of these disorders through the participation of renowned experts from all WAO regions of the world. Sections on definition and classification, prevalence, etiology and pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis are based on the best scientific evidence presently available. Additional sections devoted to urticaria and angioedema in children and pregnant women, quality of life and patient-reported outcomes, and physical urticarias have been incorporated into this document. It is expected that this article will supplement recent international guidelines with the contribution of an expert panel designated by the WAO, increasing awareness of the importance of urticaria and angioedema in medical practice and will become a useful source of information for optimum patient management worldwide.

Data from the Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS) were analysed to evaluate the effectiveness of icatibant in the treatment of patients with C1-INH-AAE and compare disease characteristics with those with C1-INH-HAE types I/II. Key medical history (including prior occurrence of attacks) was recorded upon IOS enrolment. Thereafter, data were recorded retrospectively at approximately 6-month intervals during patient follow-up visits. In the icatibant-treated population, 16 patients with C1-INH-AAE had 287 attacks and 415 patients with C1-INH-HAE types I/II had 2245 attacks. Patients with C1-INH-AAE versus C1-INH-HAE types I/II were more often male (69 versus 42%; P = 0\u00b7035) and had a significantly later mean (95% confidence interval) age of symptom onset [57\u00b79 (51\u00b733-64\u00b753) versus 14\u00b70 (12\u00b770-15\u00b726) years].

These potentially life-threatening episodes occur in over one-half of the patients affected by HAE during their lifetimes. Acute therapy had been relegated to supportive care, intubation, and consideration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP)--the latter with the potential for actually accelerating the speed and severity of the swelling. In this article we will review the recently approved and emerging HAE treatments that have evolved from the recognition that bradykinin generation is the fundamental abnormality leading to attacks of angioedema. Acute therapy for laryngeal attacks will be discussed including purified plasma-derived C1 inhibitor (C1INH), recombinant C1INH, an inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (ecallantide), and a B2 receptor antagonist (icatibant). Prophylactic care has also been transformed from a reliance on attenuated androgens with their attendant side effects to C1INH replacement. The arrival of these novel therapies promises to transform the future management of HAE.\n[Snoring-Induced Vibratory Angioedema.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26437464)\nKalathoor, Ipe\n2015-10-01\nVibratory angioedema (VA) is a rare physical urticaria, with symptoms of itching and swelling of the skin or mucosa when it is exposed to vibration.

Icatibant is a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist that may be beneficial in patients with ACE-I-induced angioedema. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of icatibant in subjects with ACE-I-induced angioedema. At 31 centers in 4 countries, adults on ACE-Is who presented within 12 hours of the onset of at least moderately severe angioedema were randomized 1:1 to icatibant 30 mg or placebo administered subcutaneously. The primary efficacy end point was time to meeting discharge criteria after study drug administration, based on the severity of airway symptoms assessed hourly by a blinded physician using clinical ratings across 4 domains. A total of 121 subjects were randomized (icatibant, n = 61; placebo, n = 60); 118 received treatment a median of 7.8 hours from symptom onset. We observed no difference in time to meeting discharge criteria between groups (median, 4.0 hours in each group; P = .63). There also was no difference in time to onset of symptom relief (median, icatibant, 2.0 hours; placebo, 1.6 hours; P = .57) or any other secondary end point. Similar findings were noted in prespecified and post hoc subgroup analyses stratified by symptom severity, time interval to treatment, age, and other clinical covariates. No new safety signals were detected. Icatibant was no more efficacious than placebo in at least moderately severe ACE-I-induced angioedema of the upper airway. Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

It frequently is a unilateral reaction and usually lasts for several hours but may persist for several days. We report 2 cases of angioedema that involved the right upper and lower eyelids and was associated with congestion of the right bulbar conjunctiva; the symptoms started approximately 1 to 2 hours after taking loxoprofen sodium. All of the symptoms subsided after oral corticosteroid therapy. In both cases, an oral challenge test with 60 mg of loxoprofen sodium (contained in a tablet) caused swelling of the right upper eyelid within several hours, followed by swelling of the right bulbar conjunctiva.

One subgroup of bradykinin induced angioedema is angioedema triggered by treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Due to its localization in the head and neck region and its unpredictable course, it is a possibly life-threatening condition. There is not an officially approved treatment for ACE inhibitor induced angioedema. Case Report: We present a case of an 83-year-old woman, who presented to our ENT department because of acute swelling of the tongue. On admission, there was no pharyngeal or laryngeal edema and no dyspnea. Treatment with glucocorticoids and antihistamines had no response. The patient had ramipril as regular medication, so we assumed ACE inhibitor induced angioedema and treated consequently with C1-inhibitor (human) 1,500 IU. Nevertheless, swelling was progressive and required intubation. Even after the second specific treatment with icatibant, her angioedema subsided extremely slowly. The patient also had regular treatment with saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, so we assumed that the simultaneous inhibition of two bradykinin degrading enzymes led to a treatment-refractory course of angioedema. Conclusions: General awareness for bradykinin induced angioedema due to regular medication is limited. Our case demonstrated the importance of improving awareness and knowledge about this side effect. We need a better understanding of the pathomechanism to aid in more precise clinical diagnosis. Securing the patient\u2019s airway as well as administration of an officially approved therapy is of utmost importance. As the number of patients simultaneously treated with antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs is likely to increase, the incidence of bradykinin mediated drug induced angioedema is\n[[Tranexamic acid as first-line emergency treatment for episodes of bradykinin-mediated angioedema induced by ACE inhibitors].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29735174)\nBeauch\u00eane, C; Martins-H\u00e9richer, J; Denis, D; Martin, L; Maillard, H\n2018-05-04\nEpisodes of acquired bradykinin-mediated angioedema due to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may result in fatal outcomes. There is no consensus regarding emergency pharmacological management of these episodes. Treatment options include icatibant and C1INH concentrate. Tranexamic acid is administered for moderate episodes. Its efficacy in the treatment of ACE inhibitor-induced episodes of angioedema is not established. The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the benefits of emergency tranexamic acid administration in the management of ACE inhibitor-induced episodes of angioedema. Retrospective analysis of the medical files of patients who consulted between 2010 and 2016 in two French tertiary care hospitals for a bradykinic angioedema attributed to an ACE treatment. All of them had received tranexamic acid as a first line treatment. Thirty three patients who had experienced severe episode of angioedema were included. Twenty seven patients showed significant improvement when treated with tranexamic acid alone. The six remaining patients were treated with icatibant (5/33) or C1INH concentrate (1/33), due to partial improvement after tranexamic acid therapy. None of the patients were intubated, no fatalities were recorded and no side effects were reported. Tranexamic acid is an easily accessible and affordable therapy that may provide effective treatment for ACE inhibitor-induced episodes of angioedema. It may help while waiting for a more specific treatment (icatibant and C1INH concentrate) that is at times unavailable in emergency departments.

It may occur in the course of lymphoproliferative disorders or autoimmune diseases. Symptoms resemble hereditary angioedema, and the only differentiating features is negative family history, late onset of symptoms and accompanying lymphoproliferative disorder. The aim of the study was to analyze the cases of acquired angioedema. The retrospective analysis of 341 patients from the registry of patients with C1 inhibitor deficiency. Results: We identified 4 patients among 119 with HAE (3.57%) diagnosed in this same period of time 2012-2016 who fulfilled the criteria of acquired edema. In two cases the primary reason of angioedema was lymphoproliferive disease, in two monoclonal gammapathy of unknown reason. We analyzed also the results of laboratory tests C4, C1 inhibitor, C1q. In all cases the face was dominated localization. After the treatment of primary lymphoproliferive disease, in two cases, we observed total remission of angioedema.

It is characterized by recurrent acute edema of the extremities, the face, the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal tract. Acute laryngeal edema usually produces laryngeal obstruction. Two cases have been treated since 1986, one of them had been admitted for forty-five times because of recurrent acute laryngeal edema. Investigations showed two families with a high incidence of this disease. Laboratory examination showed a remarkable decrease of C1-INH and C4. Tracheotomy is indicated in patients with laryngeal edema.

It results from reduced expression or loss of function of CI-esterase inhibitors (C1-INH). As opposed to the more common histamine-mediated angioedema, HAE does not respond well to conventional treatments with anti-histamines, steroids and adrenaline. Early recognition and timely intervention with the correct treatment are crucial particularly preventing airway obstruction. New disease specific treatment including plasma derived or recombinant C1-INH, ecallantide and icatibant have recently emerged and its appropriate use can reduce HAE-associated mortality and morbidity. However due to its costs, these disease specific treatments have yet to reach Malaysia. Despite that no randomized clinical trial on FFP has been performed, its efficacy in treating acute attacks of HAE is only demonstrated in case studies. This case report illustrates the successful treatment of acute HAE episode with FFP in a Malaysian government hospital setting.\n[The establishment and utility of Sweha-Reg: a Swedish population-based registry to understand hereditary angioedema](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=2151953)\nMallbris, Lotus; Nordenfelt, Patrik; Bj\u00f6rkander, Janne; Lindfors, Anders; Werner, Sonja; Wahlgren, Carl-Fredrik\n2007-01-01\nBackground The importance of acquiring comprehensive epidemiological and clinical data on hereditary angioedema has increasingly caught the attention of physicians and scientists around the world. The development of networks and creation of comprehensive policies to improve care of people suffering from rare diseases, such as hereditary angioedema, is a stated top priority of the European Union. Hereditary angioedema is a rare disease, that it may be life-threatening. Although the exact prevalence is unknown, current estimates suggest that it is 1/10,000\u20131/150,000 individuals. The low prevalence requires combined efforts to gain accurate epidemiological data on the disease and so give us tools to reduce morbidity and mortality, and improve quality of life of sufferers. Methods Sweha-Reg is a population-based registry of hereditary angioedema in Sweden with the objectives of providing epidemiological data, and so creates a framework for the study of this disease. The registry contains individual-based data on diagnoses, treatments and outcomes. Conclusion The present manuscript seeks to raise awareness of the existence of Sweha-Reg to stimulate the international collaboration of registries. A synthesis of data from similar registries across several countries is required to approach an inclusive course understanding of HAE.

In a phase 2 trial, the use of CSL830, a nanofiltered C1 inhibitor preparation that is suitable for subcutaneous injection, resulted in functional levels of C1 inhibitor activity that would be expected to provide effective prophylaxis of attacks. We conducted an international, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of self-administered subcutaneous CSL830 in patients with type I or type II hereditary angioedema who had had four or more attacks in a consecutive 2-month period within 3 months before screening. We randomly assigned the patients to one of four treatment sequences in a crossover design, each involving two 16-week treatment periods: either 40 IU or 60 IU of CSL830 per kilogram of body weight twice weekly followed by placebo, or vice versa. The primary efficacy end point was the number of attacks of angioedema. Secondary efficacy end points were the proportion of patients who had a response (\u226550% reduction in the number of attacks with CSL830 as compared with placebo) and the number of times that rescue medication was used. Of the 90 patients who underwent randomization, 79 completed the trial. Both doses of CSL830, as compared with placebo, reduced the rate of attacks of hereditary angioedema (mean difference with 40 IU, -2.42 attacks per month; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.38 to -1.46; and mean difference with 60 IU, -3.51 attacks per month; 95% CI, -4.21 to -2.81; P<0.001 for both comparisons). Response rates were 76% (95% CI, 62 to 87) in the 40-IU group and 90% (95% CI, 77 to 96) in the 60-IU group. The need for rescue medication was reduced from 5.55 uses per month in the placebo group to 1.13 uses per month in the 40-IU group and from 3.89 uses in the placebo group to 0.32 uses per month in the 60-IU\n[Approaches to the diagnosis and management of patients with a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related urticaria and angioedema.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26254051)\nKowalski, Marek L; Woessner, Katharine; Sanak, Marek\n2015-08-01\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced urticarial and angioedema reactions are among the most commonly encountered drug hypersensitivity reactions in clinical practice. Three major clinical phenotypes of NSAID-induced acute skin reactions manifesting with angioedema, urticaria, or both have been distinguished: NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced urticaria/angioedema (NIUA), and single NSAID-induced urticaria and angioedema. In some patients clinical history alone might be sufficient to establish the diagnosis of a specific type of NSAID hypersensitivity, whereas in other cases oral provocation challenges are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Moreover, classification of the type of cutaneous reaction is critical for proper management. For example, in patients with single NSAID-induced reactions, chemically nonrelated COX-1 inhibitors can be safely used. However, there is cross-reactivity between the NSAIDs in patients with NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease and NIUA, and thus only use of selective COX-2 inhibitors can replace the culprit drug if the chronic treatment is necessary, although aspirin desensitization will allow for chronic treatment with NSAIDs in some patients with NIUA. In this review we present a practical clinical approach to the patient with NSAID-induced urticaria and angioedema. Copyright \u00a9 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Currently, little information exists for the Asian population on angioedema, a rare yet serious adverse event. This study aimed to describe characteristics of RAS blockers-associated angioedema (RASBA) in Thai patients. A retrospective study using the national pharmacovigilance database of Thailand was undertaken. Cases indicating the presence of angioedema with RAS blockers uses from 1984-2011 were identified. Patient demographics, co-morbidities, concomitant drugs, information for the RAS blockers and angioedema were obtained as well as causality assessment and quality of reports. A total of 895 cases were identified. Mean age was 59.9+12.8 years and 66.5% being female. Most angioedema events (48.6%) occurred during the first week of treatment. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (87.7%) were the most commonly implicated agents followed by angiotensin receptor blockers (10.5%), aldosterone antagonist (2.1%) and direct renin inhibitor (0.2%). Out of the 895 cases incorporated in this study, 165 (18.4%) were classified as serious events and resulted in hospitalization. The overall case fatality rate was 0.4%. Respiratory disturbance occurred in 46 cases (5.1%). Patients with respiratory complications tended to be younger (53.4+13.9 vs 60.3+12.7 years old; p=0.002) and with higher frequency of allergy history (26.1% vs 14.7%; p=0.032) compared to those without respiratory complications. Based on multivariate logistic regression, the adjusted OR for history of allergy was 2.23 (95%CI: 1.04 - 4.78, p = 0.041). RASBA in Thai population occurred mostly in elderly female patients and often led to hospitalization. Since large number of patients is regularly exposed to RAS-blockers, a nationwide attempt to raise awareness of clinicians when prescribing RAS-blockers is prudent.\n[Hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency: delay in diagnosis in Europe](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3751114)\n2013-01-01\nBackground Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare, debilitating, and potentially life-threatening disease characterized by recurrent edema attacks. Important advances in HAE treatment have been made, including the development of new therapies for treating or preventing attacks. Nevertheless, the disease is still frequently misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated, potentially exposing patients with laryngeal attacks to the risk of asphyxiation. Methods The Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS) is an international, observational study that documents the clinical outcome of HAE patients eligible for treatment with icatibant. Patient ages at first symptoms and at diagnosis were recorded at enrolment, and the delay between first symptoms and diagnosis was calculated. Results The median [range] diagnostic delay in HAE type I and II patients across eight countries was 8.5 years [0\u201362.0]. The median delay in diagnosis was longer for HAE type II versus type I (21 versus 8 years, respectively), although this did not quite reach statistical significance. Conclusions Although it can be difficult to differentiate HAE symptoms from those of more common angioedema sub-types (e.g. idiopathic or acquired angioedema), our results show that HAE type I and II patients have an unacceptable delay in diagnosis, even those with a family history of the disease. Raising physician awareness of this disabling and potentially fatal disease may lead to a more accurate diagnosis and timely treatment.

It is a leading cause (20-40%) of emergency room visits in the US with angioedema. We report a case of angioedema caused by ACE inhibitors confined to the upper airway after four years on treatment with Lisinopril which persisted for three weeks and required endotracheal intubation and subsequent tracheostomy due to delayed resolution. This case is one of the rare cases presented as upper airway edema which persisted for a long time. Presentation: A 60-year-old Sudanese male patient with osteoarthritis in both knees underwent bilateral total knee replacement under single-shot epidural anesthesia. He had significant past medical history of type II diabetes, bipolar affective disorder and hypertension managed with Lisinopril for the past four years. Postoperatively after 10 hours the patient desaturated and developed airway obstruction requiring intubation. Laryngoscopy revealed an edematous tongue and upper airway and vocal cords were not visualized. In view of this clinical picture a provisional diagnosis of angioedema secondary to Lisinopril was made and it was discontinued. CT scan of the neck and soft tissues revealed severe airway edema with snugly fitting endotracheal tube with no peritubal air. A repeat CT neck on the tenth postoperative day showed no signs of resolution and an elective tracheostomy was performed on the eleventh postoperative day. C1 inhibitor protein and C4 levels were assayed to exclude hereditary angioedema and were found to be within normal range. Decannulation of tracheostomy was done after airway edema resolved on the twenty-fourth postoperative day as confirmed by CT scan. Subsequently he was transferred to the ward and discharged home. Conclusion: ACEI induced angioedema is a well-recognized condition.

Attenuated androgens are effective in many but are limited by side effect profiles. There is less evidence for efficacy of tranexamic acid and progestagens; however, the small side effect profile makes tranexamic acid an option for prophylaxis in children and progestagens an option for women. C1 inhibitor is beneficial, but at present requires intravenous delivery and may need dose titration for maximum efficacy. Short-term prophylaxis should be considered for all procedures. New therapies are promising in overcoming many problems encountered with current options for long-term prophylaxis. Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Avoralstat is a small molecule inhibitor of plasma kallikrein. This study (OPuS-2) evaluated the efficacy and safety of prophylactic avoralstat 300 or 500 mg compared with placebo. OPuS-2 was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects were administered avoralstat 300 mg, avoralstat 500 mg, or placebo orally 3 times per day for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the angioedema attack rate based on adjudicator-confirmed attacks. A total of 110 subjects were randomized and dosed. The least squares (LS) mean attack rates per week were 0.589, 0.675, and 0.593 for subjects receiving avoralstat 500 mg, avoralstat 300 mg, and placebo, respectively. Overall, 1 subject in each of the avoralstat groups and no subjects in the placebo group were attack-free during the 84-day treatment period. The LS mean duration of all confirmed attacks was 25.4, 29.4 and 31.4 hours for the avoralstat 500 mg, avoralstat 300 mg and placebo groups respectively. Using the Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL), improved QoL was observed for the avoralstat 500 mg group compared with placebo. Avoralstat was generally safe and well tolerated. Although this study did not demonstrate efficacy of avoralstat in preventing angioedema attacks in C1-INH-HAE, it provided evidence of shortened angioedema episodes and improved QoL in the avoralstat 500 mg treatment group compared with placebo.

Because signs and symptoms tend to be nonspecific, the diagnosis is difficult to make, especially in the emergency department (ED). We describe 2 patients presenting with signs of hypovolemic shock, in which the diagnosis of ACEI-induced visceral angioedema was made in the ED. We surmise that patients with abdominal pain, who present with hypovolemic shock and are taking medications that can predispose to angioedema, may have this complication if their hemoglobin level is elevated compared with their previous levels. An abdominal computed tomography scan, if it does not identify any other significant etiology, will increase the probability that ACEI-induced visceral angioedema is the diagnosis when there is nonspecific bowel wall thickening or edema.

A case of isolated genital angioedema is presented with photographic documentation. Possible complications and therapeutic options are discussed. A 71-year-old man presented with painless, nonpruritic genital swelling of 4 h duration. Medical history included peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. His medications included pantoprazole, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril, which he had been taking for 3 years without any recent change in dosing. He was otherwise asymptomatic and previously had been in good health generally. The physical examination was positive only for diffuse, soft, nonpitting edema isolated to the scrotum and uncircumcised penis. The foreskin was only partially retractable. Urinalysis was normal. All symptoms resolved without complications within 48 h of discontinuing lisinopril and had not recurred at follow-up 4 months later. All cases of ACEI-RA isolated to the genitals that have been reported in the literature resolved without complications. ACEI-RA can present as isolated swelling of the genitals and is a potential cause of genital swelling. Patients who have no evidence of airway compromise, paraphimosis, or urinary retention from complications such as phimosis can be safely discharged with instructions to discontinue the offending agent and to return in case of development of the aforementioned conditions.

Both are characterized by recurrent unpredictable episodes of mucosal swelling involving three main areas: the skin, gastrointestinal tract and larynx. Swelling in the gastrointestinal tract results in abdominal pain and vomiting, while swelling in the larynx may be fatal. There are limited UK data on these patients to help improve practice and understand more clearly the burden of disease. An audit tool was designed, informed by the published UK consensus document and clinical practice, and sent to clinicians involved in the care of HAE patients through a number of national organizations. Data sets on 376 patients were received from 14 centres in England, Scotland and Wales. There were 55 deaths from HAE in 33 families, emphasizing the potentially lethal nature of this disease. These data also show that there is a significant diagnostic delay of on average 10 years for type I HAE, 18 years for type II HAE and 5 years for AAE. For HAE the average annual frequency of swellings per patient affecting the periphery was eight, abdomen 5 and airway 0\u00b75, with wide individual variation. The impact on quality of life was rated as moderate or severe by 37% of adult patients. The audit has helped to define the burden of disease in the UK and has aided planning new treatments for UK patients.

In France, side-effects to treatments are reported to the national pharmacovigilance database. The national MedDRA database was searched using the term \"angioedema\". Patients were included if they met the clinical criteria corresponding to bradykinin-mediated AE, if their C1-inhibitor levels were normal, and if they were treated with an ACEi or an ARB. 7998 cases of AE were reported between 1994 and 2013. Among these, 112 met the criteria for bradykinin-mediated AE with normal C1-inhibitor levels. On the 112 drug-AE, patients were treated with an ARB in 21% of cases (24 patients), or an ACEi in 77% of cases (88 patients), in combination with another treatment in 17 cases (mTORi for 3 patients, iDPP-4 for 1 patient, hormonal treatment for 7 patients). ENT involvement was reported in 90% of cases (tongue: 48.2%, larynx: 23.2%). The median duration of treatment before the first attack was 720 days, and the mean duration of attacks was 36.6 h. Forty-one percent (19/46) of patients relapsed after discontinuing treatment. Angioedema triggered by medication blocking the renin/angiotensin system is rare but potentially severe, with a high risk of recurrence despite cessation of the causative drug.\n[Conestat alfa for the treatment of angioedema attacks](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3132097)\nDavis, Benjamin; Bernstein, Jonathan A\n2011-01-01\nRecently, multiple C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) replacement products have been approved for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE). This review summarizes HAE and its current treatment modalities and focuses on findings from bench to bedside trials of a new C1-INH replacement, conestat alfa. Conestat alfa is unique among the other C1-INH replacement products because it is produced from transgenic rabbits rather than derived from human plasma donors, which can potentially allow an unlimited source of drug without any concern of infectious transmission. The clinical trial data generated to date indicate that conestat alfa is safe and effective for the treatment of acute HAE attacks.

Edema form due to accumulation of fluids, either through reduced drainage or increased vascular permeability. There are multiple vascular signalling pathways that regulate vessel permeability. An important mediator that increases vascular leak is the peptide hormone bradykinin, which is the principal agent in the swelling disorder hereditary angioedema. The disease is autosomal dominant inherited and presents clinically with recurrent episodes of acute swelling that can be life-threatening involving the skin, the oropharyngeal, laryngeal, and gastrointestinal mucosa. Three different types of hereditary angiodema exist in patients. The review summarises current knowledge on the pathophysiology of hereditary angiodema and focuses on recent experimental and pharmacological findings that have led to a better understanding and new treatments for the disease.\n[A Case of Miller Fisher Syndrome, Thromboembolic Disease, and Angioedema: Association or Coincidence?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28090073)\nSalehi, Nooshin; Choi, Eric D; Garrison, Roger C\n2017-01-16\nBACKGROUND Miller Fisher Syndrome is characterized by the clinical triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, and is considered to be a variant of Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Miller Fisher Syndrome is observed in approximately 1-5% of all Guillain-Barre cases in Western countries. Patients with Miller Fisher Syndrome usually have good recovery without residual deficits. Venous thromboembolism is a common complication of Guillain-Barre Syndrome and has also been reported in Miller Fisher Syndrome, but it has generally been reported in the presence of at least one prothrombotic risk factor such as immobility. A direct correlation between venous thromboembolism and Miller Fisher Syndrome or Guillain-Barre Syndrome has not been previously described. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 32-year-old Hispanic male who presented with acute, severe thromboembolic disease and concurrently demonstrated characteristic clinical features of Miller Fisher Syndrome including ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Past medical and family history were negative for thromboembolic disease, and subsequent hypercoagulability workup was unremarkable. During the course of hospitalization, the patient also developed angioedema. CONCLUSIONS We describe a possible association between Miller Fisher Syndrome, thromboembolic disease, and angioedema.\n[Misdiagnosis trends in patients with hereditary angioedema from the real-world clinical setting.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27742086)\nZanichelli, Andrea; Longhurst, Hilary J; Maurer, Marcus; Bouillet, Laurence; Aberer, Werner; Fabien, Vincent; Andresen, Irmgard; Caballero, Teresa\n2016-10-01\nHereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) causes swelling in the skin and upper airways and pain in the abdomen because of mucosal swelling. C1-INH-HAE is frequently misdiagnosed, leading to delays in diagnosis, inadequate treatment, and unnecessary procedures. To evaluate the history of misdiagnosis in patients participating in the Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS). The IOS is an observational study in which safety and effectiveness of icatibant have been evaluated since 2009. As part of the IOS, patients record any misdiagnoses received before being diagnosed as having C1-INH-HAE. In January 2016, a total of 418 of 633 IOS patients with C1-INH-HAE type I or II had provided misdiagnosis data. Of these, 185 of 418 (44.3%) received 1 or more prior misdiagnoses. The most common misdiagnoses were allergic angioedema (103 of 185) and appendicitis (50 of 185). A variety of other misdiagnoses were reported, including a substantial number of gastrointestinal disorders (excluding appendicitis). Misdiagnosis rates were similar between males (41.1%) and females (46.5%) and between C1-INH-HAE type I (43.7%) and type II (51.6%). Patients with family members diagnosed as having C1-INH-HAE were significantly less likely to be misdiagnosed than patients without a family history (140 of 366 [41.7%] vs 38 of 58 [65.5%], respectively; P = .001). Patients with a prior misdiagnosis had longer median delay to C1-INH-HAE diagnosis (13.3 years) than patients without (1.7 years; P < .001). From this large database, approximately 50% of patients with C1-INH-HAE type I or II have previously had their conditions misdiagnosed, most commonly as allergic angioedema or appendicitis. Misdiagnosis results in marked delays in receiving the correct diagnosis, during which time patients cannot access effective, lifesaving treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01034969.

PubMed was searched with no time limitations using the keywords hereditary angioedema or angio-oedema combined with danazol, stanozolol, and androgen. Qualifying articles were English-language reports of androgen use in patients with HAE, with relevant safety and/or efficacy information. Reports were categorized according to level of evidence (LOE). The search process identified 153 citations, 63 of which contained relevant information; 2 additional publications were identified while other citations were being reviewed. Fifteen LOE 2 studies and multiple LOE 4 reports provided efficacy data, confirming a high level of prophylactic efficacy for androgen therapy in HAE, with occasional reports of poor prophylactic response. Common adverse events include weight gain, menstrual irregularities, virilization, headaches, myalgias or cramps, mood changes, and elevations in creatine phosphokinase level, liver function test results, and serum lipid level. The risk of adverse events is often correlated with dose and/or treatment duration. Rare cases of hepatic adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma associated with long-term androgen use often had no preceding changes in liver function test results. Androgen therapy may be effective for most patients with HAE; however, potential risks and adverse effects must be carefully considered and discussed with patients when considering options for long-term HAE prophylaxis.

Food and Drug Administration approval of 4 on-demand HAE therapies starting in 2009 and the publication of ED guidelines for angioedema management in 2014 should facilitate improvement of HAE management in the ED. The objective of this study was to identify patient-reported areas for improvement in ED management of HAE attacks. Patients with self-reported HAE with C1 inhibitor deficiency who attended the 2015 HAE Association Patient Summit were asked to complete an anonymous 30-question survey. Questions addressed patient characteristics and HAE management in the ED. Patients indicated that understanding of HAE in the ED needed improvement (99%, 104 of 105 patients). Recognition of HAE as a diagnosis (48%, 50 of 105 patients), appreciation of HAE as a serious disease (45%, 47 of 105 patients), and medication management (59%, 62 of 105 patients) were identified as areas needing improvement. Among 39 patients who required ED care within the last year, 6 did not receive any HAE-targeted therapy, and treatment with corticosteroids (n = 3), epinephrine (n = 2), and antihistamines (n = 7) was reported. Among 68 patients whose treatment plan was to receive home on-demand therapy, 26 required ED care because of an inability to receive on-demand therapy at home as outlined in their treatment plan. Having a treatment plan was associated with a greater likelihood of receiving HAE therapy in the ED (99% vs 74%, P = .002). HAE management in the ED can be improved with a focus on recognition of HAE attacks and administration of effective HAE therapies.

For this reason we convened a group of specialists that focus upon HAE from around the world to develop not only a consensus on diagnosis and management of HAE, but to also provide evidence based grades, strength of evidence and classification for the consensus. Since both consensus and evidence grading were adhered to the document meets criteria as a guideline. The outcome of the guideline is to improve diagnosis and management of patients with HAE throughout the world and to help initiate uniform care and availability of therapies to all with the diagnosis no matter where the residence of the individual with HAE exists.

She complained of nausea, vomiting, headache, pain in both eyes and acute loss of vision. Her visual acuity was reduced and intraocular pressures (IOP) were elevated. Gonioscopy revealed complete angle closure in the left eye and complete to partial closure in the right eye. Through existing peripheral iridotomies the anterior capsules were seen pressed up against the iris of both eyes. A diagnosis of angle-closure glaucoma was made, medications were started to reduce the elevated intraocular pressure and systemic antihistamine to counter the allergic reaction. She was hospitalised for further management. A follow-up at 2 years revealed her visual acuities and IOP had remained normal.\n[[Facial and oropharyngeal angioedema in patient with alimentary fish allergy.

Attacks are unpredictable, debilitating, and have a significant impact on quality of life. Patients may be prescribed prophylactic therapy to prevent angioedema attacks. Current prophylactic treatments may be difficult to administer (i.e., intravenously), require frequent administrations or are not well tolerated, and breakthrough attacks may still occur frequently. Lanadelumab is a subcutaneously-administered monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein in clinical development for prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema attacks. A Phase 1b study supported its efficacy in preventing attacks. A Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study has been completed and an open-label extension is currently ongoing. The primary objective of the open-label extension is to evaluate the long-term safety of repeated subcutaneous administrations of lanadelumab in patients with type I/II HAE. Secondary objectives include evaluation of efficacy and time to first angioedema attack to determine outer bounds of the dosing interval. The study will also evaluate immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, quality of life, characteristics of breakthrough attacks, ease of self-administration, and safety/efficacy in patients who switch to lanadelumab from another prophylactic therapy. The open-label extension will enroll patients who completed the double-blind study (\"rollover patients\") and those who did not participate in the double-blind study (\"non-rollover patients\"), which includes patients who may or may not be currently using another prophylactic therapy. Rollover patients will receive a single 300 mg dose of lanadelumab on Day 0 and the second dose after the patient's first confirmed angioedema attack. Thereafter, lanadelumab will be administered every 2 weeks. Non-rollover patients will receive 300 mg lanadelumab every 2 weeks regardless\n[Clinical Features of Hereditary and Mast Cell-mediated Angioedema Focusing on the Differential Diagnosis in Japanese Patients.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29093383)\nOhsawa, Isao; Honda, Daisuke; Hisada, Atsuko; Inoshita, Hiroyuki; Onda-Tsueshita, Kisara; Mano, Satoshi; Sato, Nobuyuki; Nakamura, Yuya; Shimizu, Tatsuo; Gotoh, Hiromichi; Goto, Yoshikazu; Suzuki, Yusuke; Tomino, Yasuhiko\n2018-02-01\nObjective The present study was designed to identify the clinical characteristics that permit the differential diagnosis of hereditary angioedema (HAE) and mast cell-mediated angioedema (Mast-AE) during the first consultation. Methods The medical histories and laboratory data of 46 patients with HAE and 41 patients with Mast-AE were compared. Results The average age of onset in the HAE group (19.8\u00b19.0 years) was significantly lower than that in the Mast-AE group (35.2\u00b112.0 years). The incidence of familial angioedema (AE) in the HAE group (73.9%) was significantly higher than that in the Mast-AE group (9.7%). The frequency of history of AE in the extremities, larynx, or gastrointestinal tract was significantly higher in the HAE group. The frequency of AE episodes of the lips and eyelids was significantly lower in the HAE group. The serum C4 concentration and CH50 titer were lower than the normal limit in 91.3% and 45.6% of the patients in the HAE group, respectively; in Mast-AE group the serum C4 concentration and CH50 titer were significantly lower than the normal limit in 4.8% and 0% of the patients, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant. A C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) activity level of <50% was observed in all of the HAE patients, but none of the Mast-AE patients. The mean serum IgE titer in the HAE group (120.8\u00b1130.5 IU/mL) was significantly lower than that in the Mast-AE group (262.2\u00b1314.9 IU/mL). Conclusion The parameters within the patients' medical histories, such as the age at the onset of AE, a family history of AE, and the locations of past AE episodes are critical for the successful diagnosis of the disease. Measurements of the C4 and C1-INH activity are very useful for differential diagnosis of HAE from Mast-AE.\n[Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor in a French cohort: Clinical characteristics and response to treatment with icatibant.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28250922)\nBouillet, Laurence; Boccon-Gibod, Isabelle; Launay, David; Gompel, Anne; Kanny, Gisele; Fabien, Vincent; Fain, Oliver\n2017-03-01\nThe clinical characteristics and icatibant-treatment outcomes of patients with hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor (HAE-nC1 INH) are limited. We retrospectively analyzed data from French HAE patients enrolled in the Icatibant Outcome Survey registry (from July 2009 to September 2013) to compare disease characteristics and the effectiveness and safety of acute icatibant-treated angioedema attacks in patients with HAE-nC1 INH, HAE with C1 INH deficiency (type I), or dysfunction (type II). One center in Grenoble contributed 22 patients with HAE-nC1 INH and a family history of HAE while 15 centers across France contributed 153 patients with HAE type I and seven patients with HAE type II. Patients with HAE-nC1 INH compared to HAE type I, respectively, were more likely to be female (88.1% vs. 63.4%), older at median age of disease onset (21 years vs. 15 years), and have a greater rate of abdominal (80% vs. 61%) and laryngeal (23% vs. 14%) attacks. Icatibant was effective in both groups though the median time to resolution of attack was significantly longer in the HAE-nC1 INH group (20.0 h, 37 attacks) versus the HAE type I group (14.0 h, 67 attacks). Icatibant was self-administered for 96.1% of attacks in patients with HAE-nC1 INH and 75.8% in patients with HAE type I. No serious adverse side effects related to icatibant were reported. These data help further define the disease characteristics of HAE-nC1 INH in the French population and extend the limited data reporting the safe and effective use of icatibant in acute treatment of angioedema in French patients diagnosed with HAE-nC1 INH.\n[Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor in a French cohort: Clinical characteristics and response to treatment with icatibant](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=5322159)\nBoccon\u2010Gibod, Isabelle; Launay, David; Gompel, Anne; Kanny, Gisele; Fabien, Vincent; Fain, Oliver\n2017-01-01\nAbstract Introduction The clinical characteristics and icatibant\u2010treatment outcomes of patients with hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor (HAE\u2010nC1 INH) are limited.

In this paper we report the protocol for the development and validation of a specific questionnaire, with details on the results of the process of item generation, domain selection, and the expert and patient rating phase. Semi-structured interviews were completed by 45 patients with hereditary angioedema and 8 experts from 8 regions in Spain. A qualitative content analysis of the responses was carried out. Issues raised by respondents were grouped into categories. Content analysis identified 240 different responses, which were grouped into 10 conceptual domains. Sixty- four items were generated. A total of 8 experts and 16 patients assessed the items for clarity, relevance to the disease, and correct dimension assignment. The preliminary version of the specific health-related quality of life questionnaire for hereditary angioedema (HAE-QoL v 1.1) contained 44 items grouped into 9 domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-centre research project that aims to develop a specific health-related quality of life questionnaire for adult patients with hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency. A preliminary version of the specific HAE-QoL questionnaire was obtained. The qualitative analysis of interviews together with the expert and patient rating phase helped to ensure content validity. A pilot study will be performed to assess the psychometric properties of the questionnaire and to decide on the final version.\n[The Icatibant Outcome Survey: treatment of laryngeal angioedema attacks](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4892758)\nAberer, Werner; Bouillet, Laurence; Caballero, Teresa; Maurer, Marcus; Fabien, Vincent; Zanichelli, Andrea\n2016-01-01\nObjective To characterize the management and outcomes of life-threatening laryngeal attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) treated with icatibant in the observational Icatibant Outcome Survey (NCT01034969) registry. Methods This retrospective analysis was based on data from patients with HAE type I/II who received healthcare professional-administered or self-administered icatibant to treat laryngeal attacks between September 2008 and May 2013. Results Twenty centers in seven countries contributed data. Overall, 42 patients with HAE experienced 67 icatibant-treated laryngeal attacks. Icatibant was self-administered for 62.3% of attacks (healthcare professional-administered, 37.7%). One icatibant injection was used for 87.9% of attacks, with rescue or concomitant medication used for 9.0%. The median time to treatment was 2.0 h (n=31 attacks) and the median time to resolution was 6.0 h (n=35 attacks). Conclusions This analysis describes successful use of icatibant for the treatment of laryngeal HAE attacks in a real-world setting.

It remains to be determined if prodromes could be useful indicators for early treatment initiation. Most published reports of prodromes have been limited to case reports or small case series. The common objective of several recent survey-based studies was to collect information relevant to prodromal patterns in patients with HAE. Three separate surveys solicited prodromal data from HAE patients. Although differences in survey methodologies permit only descriptive analysis of data, responses to the surveys provide the largest compilation of observational data on this topic to date. Prodromes were reported by 82.5-95.7% of patients surveyed. In one survey, about two-thirds of subjects reported experiencing prodromes before all or most acute HAE attacks, and only 6% of subjects noted the appearance of prodromes in <10% of all attacks. The most common types of prodromal symptoms were related to skin/soft tissue and gastrointestinal tract. Most prodromes were experienced hours to days before the onset of angioedema. A large percentage of surveyed subjects indicated being able to predict an impending HAE attack all or most of the time; <10% reported being rarely or never able to predict an attack. Although insufficient to establish the clinical role of prodromal symptoms, results of these surveys provide additional data on the scope of prodromes and could stimulate further research into the potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness of HAE attack prediction and prodrome-triggered interventions.\n[\"Surgical\" abdomen in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a case of acquired angioedema.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21997434)\nJung, Moonjung; Rice, Lawrence\n2011-12-01\nAcquired angioedema (AAE), an acquired deficiency of C1esterase inhibitor, is a medically treatable condition which can cause severe abdominal pain mimicking an acute surgical abdomen. This disorder is strongly associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other indolent lymphoplasmacytic disorders. We describe a patient with known CLL who developed incapacitating, recurrent severe abdominal pains, culminating in partial bowel resection. Signs, symptoms, laboratory and pathologic findings demonstrated AAE. Wider appreciation of the possibility of AAE, particularly in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders, could lead to preventive therapy and spare unnecessary surgery. This is more important now that more effective medical therapies are available.\n[C1-inhibitor concentrate home therapy for hereditary angioedema: a viable, effective treatment option](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=1804208)\nLonghurst, H J; Carr, S; Khair, K\n2007-01-01\nEconomic and political factors have led to the increased use of home therapy programmes for patients who have traditionally been treated in hospital. Many patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) experience intermittent severe attacks that affect their quality of life and may be life-threatening. These attacks are treated with C1-inhibitor concentrate which, for most patients, is infused at the local hospital. Home therapy programmes for HAE are currently being established. This paper reviews the extent of use of these programmes and summarizes the advantages and potential disadvantages of the concept so far.

Retrospective data mining analysis. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system (AERS) database. Case reports of C1 esterase inhibitor products, thrombotic events, and C1 esterase inhibitor product-associated thrombotic events (i.e., combination cases) were extracted from the AERS database, using the time frames of each respective product's FDA approval date through the second quarter of 2011. Bayesian statistical methodology within the neural network architecture was implemented to identify potential signals of a drug-associated adverse event. A potential signal is generated when the lower limit of the 95% 2-sided confidence interval of the information component, denoted by IC\u2080\u2082\u2085 , is greater than zero. This suggests that the particular drug-associated adverse event was reported to the database more often than statistically expected from reports available in the database. Ten combination cases of thrombotic events associated with the use of one C1 esterase inhibitor product (Cinryze) were identified in patients with hereditary angioedema. A potential signal demonstrated by an IC\u2080\u2082\u2085 value greater than zero (IC\u2080\u2082\u2085 = 2.91) was generated for these combination cases. The extracted cases from the AERS indicate continuing reports of thrombotic events associated with the use of one C1 esterase inhibitor product among patients with hereditary angioedema. The AERS is incapable of establishing a causal link and detecting the true frequency of an adverse event associated with a drug; however, potential signals of C1 esterase inhibitor product-associated thrombotic events among patients with hereditary angioedema were identified in the extracted combination cases. \u00a9 2012 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.\n[Hereditary Angioedema Attacks: Local Swelling at Multiple Sites.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527240)\nHofman, Zonne L M; Relan, Anurag; Hack, C Erik\n2016-02-01\nHereditary angioedema (HAE) patients experience recurrent local swelling in various parts of the body including painful swelling of the intestine and life-threatening laryngeal oedema. Most HAE literature is about attacks located in one anatomical site, though it is mentioned that HAE attacks may also involve multiple anatomical sites simultaneously. A detailed description of such multi-location attacks is currently lacking. This study investigated the occurrence, severity and clinical course of HAE attacks with multiple anatomical locations. HAE patients included in a clinical database of recombinant human C1-inhibitor (rhC1INH) studies were evaluated. Visual analog scale scores filled out by the patients for various symptoms at various locations and investigator symptoms scores during the attack were analysed. Data of 219 eligible attacks in 119 patients was analysed. Thirty-three patients (28%) had symptoms at multiple locations in anatomically unrelated regions at the same time during their first attack. Up to five simultaneously affected locations were reported. The observation that severe HAE attacks often affect multiple sites in the body suggests that HAE symptoms result from a systemic rather than from a local process as is currently believed.\n[Socioeconomic burden of hereditary angioedema: results from the hereditary angioedema burden of illness study in Europe.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24996814)\nAyg\u00f6ren-P\u00fcrs\u00fcn, Emel; Bygum, Anette; Beusterien, Kathleen; Hautamaki, Emily; Sisic, Zlatko; Wait, Suzanne; Boysen, Henrik B; Caballero, Teresa\n2014-07-04\nHereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 inhibitor deficiency is a rare but serious and potentially life-threatening disease marked by spontaneous, recurrent attacks of swelling. The study objective was to characterize direct and indirect resource utilization associated with HAE from the patient perspective in Europe. The study was conducted in Spain, Germany, and Denmark to assess the real-world experience of HAE via a cross-sectional survey of HAE patients, including direct and indirect resource utilization during and between attacks for patients and their caregivers over the past 6 months. A regression model examined predictors of medical resource utilization. Overall, 164 patients had an attack in the past 6 months and were included in the analysis. The most significant predictor of medical resource utilization was the severity of the last attack (OR 2.6; p < 0.001). Among patients who sought medical care during the last attack (23%), more than half utilized the emergency department. The last attack prevented patients from their normal activities an average of 4-12 hours. Patient and caregiver absenteeism increased with attack severity and frequency. Among patients who were working or in school (n = 120), 72 provided work/school absenteeism data, resulting in an estimated 20 days missing from work/school on average per year; 51% (n = 84) indicated that HAE has hindered their career/educational advancement. HAE poses a considerable burden on patients and their families in terms of direct medical costs and indirect costs related to lost productivity. This burden is substantial at the time of attacks and in between attacks.\n[Socioeconomic burden of hereditary angioedema: results from the hereditary angioedema burden of illness study in Europe](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4105891)\n2014-01-01\nBackground Hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 inhibitor deficiency is a rare but serious and potentially life-threatening disease marked by spontaneous, recurrent attacks of swelling.

Although bradykinin formation is typically initiated by factor XII autoactivation, it is also possible to activate factor XII either by kallikrein, thus formed, or by plasmin. Because attacks of hereditary angioedema can be related to infection and/or exposure to estrogen, we questioned whether estrogen or cytokine stimulation of endothelial cells could augment release of Hsp90 and prekallikrein activation. We also tested release of profibrinolytic enzymes, urokinase, and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) as a source for plasmin formation. Cells were stimulated with agonists, and secretion of Hsp90, urokinase, and TPA was measured in the culture supernatants by ELISA. Activation of the prekallikrein-HK complex was measured by using pro-phe-arg-p-nitroanilide reflecting kallikrein formation. Hsp90 release was stimulated with optimal doses of estradiol, IL-1, and TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/mL) from 15 minutes to 120 minutes. TPA release was not augmented by any of the agonists tested but urokinase was released by IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, and thrombin (positive control), but not estrogen. Augmented activation of the prekallikrein-HK complex to generate kallikrein was seen with each agonist that releases Hsp90. Addition of 0.1% factor XII relative to prekallikrein-HK leads to rapid formation of kallikrein; factor XII alone does not autoactivate. IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, and estrogen stimulate release of Hsp90 and augment activation of the prekallikrein-HK complex to generate kallikrein and bradykinin. IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 stimulate release of urokinase, which can convert plasminogen to plasmin and represents a possible source for plasmin generation in all types of hereditary angioedema, but particularly hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor with a factor XII mutation. Both kallikrein and\n[The relationship between anxiety and quality of life in children with hereditary angioedema.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28692169)\nKessel, Aharon; Farkas, Henriette; Kivity, Shmuel; Veszeli, N\u00f3ra; K\u0151halmi, Kinga V; Engel-Yeger, Batya\n2017-11-01\nThe severe life-threatening characteristics of hereditary angioedema (HAE) with C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) can affect anxiety levels among pediatric patients. This emotional burden together with the physical restrictions of C1-INH-HAE may decrease children's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). (i) To compare anxiety state and trait between children with C1-INH-HAE and healthy controls; (ii) to examine the relationship between the level of anxiety of children with C1-INH-HAE, their disease activity/affected sites and their HRQoL; and (iii) to predict the HRQoL of children with C1-INH-HAE based on their anxiety level and disease activity/affected sites METHODS: Thirty-three children with C1-INH-HAE (aged 5-18 years) and 52 healthy controls were recruited from Israel and Hungary. All children completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Peds-QL) demographic questionnaire and a disease activity and site questionnaire . Disease activity was defined as the number of attacks in last year. Both anxiety state and trait were significantly higher among children with C1-INH-HAE as compared to the controls (44.74\u00b110.56 vs 38.76\u00b110.67, P<.01, 29.21\u00b15.16 vs 25.23\u00b14.09, P<.001 in comparison). Significant differences were found between C1-INH-HAE patients with HAE attacks, asymptomatic C1-INH-HAE patients, and healthy controls in both anxiety state (F 56,2 =4.69, P=.001) and trait (F 56,2 =9.06, P<.0001). A higher anxiety trait was correlated with the number of angioedema-affected sites (r=.52, P=.003). The presence of HAE attacks and higher anxiety trait predicted a lower HRQoL in children with C1-INH-HAE. C1-INH-HAE children have higher anxiety trait and state, which correlate with reduced HRQoL domains. \u00a9 2017 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Correct management of anaphylaxis during anaesthesia requires a multidisciplinary approach with prompt recognition and treatment of the acute event by the attending anesthesiologist. A 34-year-old woman was scheduled to undergo endo venous laser therapy of varicose veins. She had no history of allergies and had never undergone general anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced with propofol and rocuronium bromide. Approximately three minutes after rocuronium administration, hypotension and tachycardia developed and angioedema around the eyelids and skin rashes and urticaria appeared. The patient received ephedrine and hydrocortisone with hydration. After achieving stable vital signs and symptom relief, surgery was performed without complications. A postoperative skin dermal test performed to identify the agent responsible revealed a positive skin test for rocuronium.

There is also a persistent low level of C4 in 95 % of patients even when they are symptomatic. These phenomena are due to the properties of the C1r subcomponent of C1, factor XII, and the bimolecular complex of prekallikrein with high molecular weight kininogen (HK). Purified C1r auto-activates in physiologic buffers, activates C1s, which in turn depletes C4. This occurs when C1 inhibitor is deficient. The complex of prekallikrein-HK acquires an inducible active site not present in prekallikrein which in Tris-type buffers cleaves HK stoichiometrically to release bradykinin, or in phosphate buffer auto-activates to generate kallikrein and bradykinin. Thus immunologic depletion of C1 inhibitor from factor XII-deficient plasma (phosphate is the natural buffer) auto-activates on incubation to release bradykinin. Normal C1 inhibitor prevents this from occurring. During attacks of angioedema, if factor XII auto-activates on surfaces, the initial factor XIIa formed converts prekallikrein to kallikrein, and kallikrein cleaves HK to release bradykinin. Kallikrein also rapidly activates most remaining factor XII to factor XIIa. Additional cleavages convert factor XIIa to factor XIIf and factor XIIf activates C1r enzymatically so that C4 levels approach zero, and C2 is depleted. There is also a possibility that kallikrein is generated first as a result of activation of the prekallikrein-HK complex by heat shock protein 90 released from endothelial cells, followed by kallikrein activation of factor XII.\n[The Complex Interaction Between Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Hereditary Angioedema: Case Reports and Review of the Literature.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28715060)\nIahn-Aun, Marina; Aun, Marcelo Vivolo; Motta, Antonio Ab\u00edlio; Kalil, Jorge; Giavina-Bianchi, Pedro; Hayashida, Sylvia Asaka; Baracat, Edmund Chada; Maciel, Gustavo Arantes\n2017-07-01\nHereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare but severe disease, with high risk of death, and attacks have been associated to high estrogen levels. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hyperandrogenic condition, which is frequently treated with combined oral contraceptives. The aim of this study was to describe 2 clinical cases of young women diagnosed as having PCOS who developed HAE attacks after the introduction of combined estrogen-progestin pills to treat PCOS symptoms. Literature review of sex hormones' role in genesis of HAE attacks and possible mechanisms involved. In the cases reported, after initiation of combined contraceptives, patients presented with facial swelling with airway involvement (laryngeal edema) and abdominal pain. They had a familial history of angioedema and normal C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) levels, leading to the diagnosis of HAE with normal C1-INH (HAEnC1-INH) or HAE type III. After suspension of exogenous estrogen, patients remained asymptomatic from HAE. HAEnC1-INH is an estrogen-dependent form of HAE. It is well established that exogenous estrogen triggers attacks of all types of HAE. However, this is the first description of the association between PCOS and HAE, in which PCOS could be masking HAE symptoms. We propose that PCOS might have a protective role regarding HAE attacks, because of its particular hormonal features, that is, hyperandrogenism and relative stable levels of estradiol. The use of combined estrogen-progestin compounds in women with PCOS and HAE must be avoided, and treatment must be individualized.\n[Malassezia infection associated with chronic spontaneous urticaria without angioedema: a report on five cases.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29945261)\nZawar, Vijay; Pawar, Manoj; Kumavat, Shrikant\n2018-06-01\nChronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a challenging condition to treat and it significantly affects quality of life. Bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections have been associated with triggering and/or perpetuating urticaria in certain individuals. There is a paucity of literature on CSU associated with Malassezia infection. We present a case series of five patients with CSU without angioedema in whom we observed temporal association of Malassezia infection with CSU. The presence of Malassezia was confirmed by clinical examination, Wood's lamp, and KOH examination. The patients with CSU experienced improvement after specific antifungal therapy. Malassezia infection may be associated with recurrent and chronic urticaria in a certain group of susceptible patients and thus specific targeted therapy against it might result in complete remission of urticaria along with clearing of the infection.\n[Exposure\u2010Response Model of Subcutaneous C1\u2010Inhibitor Concentrate to Estimate the Risk of Attacks in Patients With Hereditary Angioedema](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=5869560)\nTortorici, Michael A.; Pawaskar, Dipti; Pragst, Ingo; Machnig, Thomas; Hutmacher, Matthew; Zuraw, Bruce; Cicardi, Marco; Craig, Timothy; Longhurst, Hilary; Sidhu, Jagdev\n2018-01-01\nSubcutaneous C1\u2010inhibitor (HAEGARDA, CSL Behring), is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2010approved, highly concentrated formulation of a plasma\u2010derived C1\u2010esterase inhibitor (C1\u2010INH), which, in the phase III Clinical Studies for Optimal Management in Preventing Angioedema with Low\u2010Volume Subcutaneous C1\u2010inhibitor Replacement Therapy (COMPACT) trial, reduced the incidence of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks when given prophylactically.

Even though our standard blood coagulation tests are prolonged when plasma lacks contact factors, this enzyme system appears to have a minor (if any) role in haemostasis. In this review, we will explore the clinical phenotype of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency. C1-INH is the key plasma inhibitor of the contact system enzymes and its deficiency causes hereditary angioedema (HAE). This inflammatory disorder is hallmarked by recurrent aggressive attacks of tissue swelling that occur at unpredictable locations throughout the body. Bradykinin, which is considered a byproduct of the plasma contact system during in vitro coagulation, is the main disease mediator in HAE. Surprisingly, there is little evidence for thrombotic events in HAE patients, suggesting a mechanistic uncoupling from the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. In addition, it is questionable whether a surface is responsible for contact system activation in HAE. In this review, we will discuss the clinical phenotype, disease modifiers and diagnostic challenges of HAE. We will subsequently describe the underlying biochemical mechanisms and contributing disease mediators. Furthermore, we will review three types of HAE, which are not caused by C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. Finally, we will propose a central enzymatic axis that we hypothesize to be responsible for bradykinin production in health and disease. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Morbidity and mortality are significant, and new and pending therapies are now available to reduce the risk associated with the disease. To update the reader on new advances in HAE to improve patient care. We performed a literature search of Ovid, PubMed, and Google to develop this review. Articles that are necessary for the understanding and use of the new therapeutic options for HAE were chosen, and studies of high quality were used to support the use of therapies, and in most cases, results from phase III studies were used. Until recently, therapy for HAE attacks in the United States consisted of symptom relief with narcotics, hydration, and fresh-frozen plasma, which contains active C1 inhibitor. Therapy to prevent HAE attacks has been confined to androgens and, occasionally, antifibrinolytic agents; however, both drug groups have significant adverse effects. The approval of C1-inhibitor concentrate for prevention and acute therapy has improved efficacy and safety. Ecallantide has also been approved for therapy of attacks, and icatibant is expected to be approved in the next few months for attacks. Recombinant C1 inhibitor is presently in phase III studies and should be available for attacks in the near future. In this article we review the changing therapeutic options available for patients in 2011 and beyond.\n[[Undiagnosed hereditary angioedema in a patient undergoing emergency caesarean section].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23362781)\nTomita, Yukihiko; Kamei, Masataka; Jyujou, Satoshi; Horiuchi, Chinami; Katsuragi, Shinji; Onishi, Yoshihiko\n2012-12-01\nHereditary angioedema (HAE) is characterized by acute, recurrent attacks of localized edema. Surgical procedures, trauma, and infections have been considered as potential triggers of HAE. Although HAE is a rare genetic disorder, approximately 50-60% of all HAE patients are involved with at least one occurrence of upper airway obstruction. The airway trouble is the most life-threating complication in HAE patients because HAE-related edema does not respond to typical treatment, such as administration of epinephrine, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Indeed, mortality rates of laryngeal attack are estimated around 25% to 40%. Here we describe a case of undiagnosed HAE patient undergoing emergency caesarean section under neuraxial blockade. A 31-year-old woman showed multiple regions at her lip margin during surgery and rapidly developed lip swelling after admission to the ward. Neither respiratory nor hemodynamic instability was found during and after surgery. Immediately, in order to assess whether HAE caused these dermatological manifestations, we measured values of both complement component 4 (C4) and functional activity of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-inh), a protein of the complement system. These laboratory data showed low levels, which were compatible with HAE definition. After commencement of C1-inhibitor replacement therapy, her lip swelling and erythema gradually disappeared without adverse drug reactions. The patient was finally discharged from our institution 10 days after surgery.\n[Health-Related Quality of Life with Subcutaneous C1-Inhibitor for Prevention of Attacks of Hereditary Angioedema.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29391286)\nLumry, William R; Craig, Timothy; Zuraw, Bruce; Longhurst, Hilary; Baker, James; Li, H Henry; Bernstein, Jonathan A; Anderson, John; Riedl, Marc A; Manning, Michael E; Keith, Paul K; Levy, Donald S; Caballero, Teresa; Banerji, Aleena; Gower, Richard G; Farkas, Henriette; Lawo, John-Philip; Pragst, Ingo; Machnig, Thomas; Watson, Douglas J\n2018-01-31\nHereditary angioedema with C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) impairs health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The objective of this study was to assess HRQoL outcomes in patients self-administering subcutaneous C1-INH (C1-INH[SC]; HAEGARDA) for routine prevention of HAE attacks. Post hoc analysis of data from the placebo-controlled, crossover phase III COMPACT study (Clinical Studies for Optimal Management of Preventing Angioedema with Low-Volume Subcutaneous C1-Inhibitor Replacement Therapy). Ninety patients with C1-INH-HAE were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences: C1-INH(SC) 40 or 60 IU/kg twice weekly for 16 weeks, preceded or followed by 16 weeks of twice weekly placebo injections. All HAE attacks were treated with open-label on-demand treatment as necessary. HRQoL assessments at week 14 (last visit) included the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI), and the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM). Compared with placebo (on-demand treatment alone), treatment with twice weekly C1-INH(SC) (both doses combined) was associated with better EQ-5D visual analog scale general health, less HADS anxiety, less WPAI presenteeism, work productivity loss, and activity impairment, and greater TSQM effectiveness and overall treatment satisfaction. More patients self-reported a \"good/excellent\" response during routine prevention with C1-INH(SC) compared with on-demand only (placebo prophylaxis) management. For each HRQoL measure, a greater proportion of patients had a clinically meaningful improvement during C1-INH(SC) treatment compared with placebo. In patients with frequent HAE attacks, a treatment strategy of routine prevention with self-administered twice weekly C1-INH(SC) had a greater impact on improving multiple HAE-related HRQoL impairments, most notably anxiety and work productivity, compared with on\n[Update on the Use of C1-Esterase Inhibitor Replacement Therapy in the Acute and Prophylactic Treatment of Hereditary Angioedema.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29909591)\nHenry Li, H; Riedl, Marc; Kashkin, Jay\n2018-06-16\nIn the vast majority of patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), angioedema attacks are due to the quantitative or functional deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), which leads to increased vascular permeability and unregulated release of bradykinin. Exogenous administration of C1-INH is a rational way to restore the concentration and functional activity of this protein, regulate the release of bradykinin, and attenuate or prevent subcutaneous and submucosal edema associated with HAE. Recent international guidelines for the management of HAE include C1-INH as an option for acute treatment of HAE. In addition, these guidelines recommend C1-INH as first-line treatment for long-term prophylaxis and as the therapy of choice for short-term/preprocedural prophylaxis. Several C1-INH products are available, with approved indications varying across regions. For the acute treatment of HAE, both plasma-derived and recombinant C1-INH formulations have been shown to be effective and well tolerated in adolescents and adults with HAE, with onset of relief within 30 min to a few hours. Plasma-derived C1-INH is approved for use in children, and recombinant C1-INH is being evaluated in this population. Intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) formulations of C1-INH have been approved for routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks in adolescents and adults. Both formulations when administered twice weekly have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of HAE attacks. The SC formulation of C1-INH obviates the need for repeated venous access and may facilitate self-administration of HAE prophylaxis at home, as recommended in HAE treatment guidelines. As with most rare diseases, the costs of HAE treatment are high; however, the development of additional acute and prophylactic medications for HAE may result in competitive pricing and help drive down the costs of HAE treatment.\n[Severe angioedema in myxedema coma: a difficult airway in a rare endocrine emergency.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19857436)\nLee, Christopher H; Wira, Charles R\n2009-10-01\nMyxedema coma is the most lethal manifestation of hypothyroidism. It is a true medical emergency and can result in profound hemodynamic instability and airway compromise. Myxedema coma currently remains a diagnostic challenge due to the rarity of cases seen today, and failure to promptly initiate therapy with replacement thyroid hormone can be fatal. As thyroid hormone therapy can take days or weeks to reverse the manifestations of myxedema coma, interim supportive therapy is critical while awaiting clinical improvement. Some patients will require endotracheal intubation in the emergency department (ED), and physicians should be aware that unanticipated posterior pharyngeal edema in myxedema coma could severely complicate airway management. Although mechanical ventilation is a well-described adjunctive therapy for myxedema coma, reports of the potential difficulty in securing a definitive airway in these patients are rare. We describe a case of an unidentified woman who presented to the ED with myxedema coma requiring urgent endotracheal intubation and was found to have extensive posterior pharyngeal angioedema inconsistent with her relatively benign external examination. This case highlights the typical features of myxedema coma and discusses our necessity for a rescue device in definitive endotracheal tube placement. Emergency physicians should anticipate a potentially difficult airway in all myxedema coma patients regardless of the degree of external facial edema present.\n[Development and content validity testing of a patient-reported outcomes questionnaire for the assessment of hereditary angioedema in observational studies.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26129930)\nBonner, Nicola; Abetz-Webb, Linda; Renault, Lydie; Caballero, Teresa; Longhurst, Hilary; Maurer, Marcus; Christiansen, Sandra; Zuraw, Bruce\n2015-07-01\nHereditary Angioedema (HAE), a rare genetic disease, manifests as intermittent, painful attacks of angioedema. Attacks vary in frequency and severity and include skin, abdominal and life-threatening laryngeal swellings. This study aimed to develop a patient reported outcome (PRO) tool for the assessment of HAE attacks, including their management and impact on patients' lives, for use in clinical studies, or by physicians in general practice. The results of open-ended face to face concept elicitation interviews with HAE patients in Argentina (n = 10) and the US (n = 33) were used to develop the first draft questionnaire of the HAE patient reported outcomes questionnaire (HAE PRO). Subsequently, in-depth cognitive debriefing interviews were performed with HAE patients in the UK (n = 10), Brazil (n = 10), Germany (n = 11) and France (n = 12). Following input from eight multinational clinical experts further cognitive interviews were conducted in the US (n = 12) and Germany (n = 12). Patients who experienced abdominal, cutaneous or laryngeal attacks of varying severity levels were included in all rounds of interviews. Across the rounds of interviews patients discussed their HAE attack symptoms, impacts and treatments. Cognitive debriefing interviews explored patient understanding and relevance of questionnaire items. All interviews were conducted face to face following a pre-defined semi-structured interview guide in the patient's native language. Patients reported a variety of HAE symptoms, attack triggers, warning signs, attack impacts and treatment options which were used to develop the HAE PRO. The HAE PRO was revised and refined following input from patients and clinical experts. The final 18-item HAE PRO provides an assessment of the HAE attack experience including symptoms, impacts, treatment requirements, healthcare resource use and loss of productivity caused by HAE attacks.

Published literature consists largely of case reports and small series. We collated data from 18 cities across Europe to provide an overview of primarily homozygous, rather than partial genotypes and their impact and management. Patients were recruited through the ESID registry. Clinical and laboratory information was collected onto standardized forms and analyzed using SPSS software. Seventy-seven patients aged 1 to 68 years were identified. 44 % presented in their first decade of life. 29 % had C2 deficiency, defects in 11 other complement factors were found. 50 (65 %) had serious invasive infections. 61 % of Neisseria meningitidis infections occurred in patients with terminal pathway defects, while 74 % of Streptococcus pneumoniae infections occurred in patients with classical pathway defects (p < 0.001). Physicians in the UK were more likely to prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis than colleagues on the Continent for patients with classical pathway defects. After diagnosis, 16 % of patients suffered serious bacterial infections. Age of the patient and use of prophylactic antibiotics were not associated with subsequent infection risk. Inflammatory/autoimmune diseases were not seen in patients with terminal pathway, but in one third of patients classical and alternative pathway defects. The clinical phenotypes of specific complement immunodeficiencies vary considerably both in terms of the predominant bacterial pathogen, and the risk and type of auto-inflammatory disease. Appreciation of these phenotypic differences should help both immunologists and other specialists in their diagnosis and management of these rare and complex patients.\n[Defense.gov Special Report: Travels with Winnefeld: USO Tour](http://archive.defense.gov/home/features/2012/0412_uso)\n: USO April 2012 Top Stories USO Tour Brings Ramstein Troops, Families Together Service members and USO celebrities paid a surprise visit to wounded warriors at an aeromedical staging facility on Ramstein Air Base in Germany.

Guidelines do not exist regarding diagnostic criteria or routine testing of family members of patients with HAE. Laboratory data for diagnosis include complement factor 4 level; C1 INH antigenic protein level, which is reduced in approximately 85% of patients with HAE; and C1 INH functional assay, which is considered an unreliable test in the United States secondary to inconsistent standardization of assays. To assess the shortcomings of diagnosing HAE and to determine whether family members of patients with HAE are being adequately screened. The top physician prescribers of danazol in the United States were screened via an Internet questionnaire focusing on the diagnosis and current management of HAE. To assess the patient perspective on HAE, affected individuals in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and The Netherlands participated in the Web-based International Survey of Patient Experience of Hereditary Angioedema. All 80 physicians who completed the survey were allergist or immunologists with a mean of 7 patients with C1 INH deficiency in their practices. Almost 84% of physician respondents used C1 INH level and function for diagnosis, and 63.8% used complement factor 4 levels. A total of 313 patients with HAE completed the survey. Respondents noted that only 48% of immediate family members and 26% of extended family members had been tested. Guidelines could potentially alleviate delays in diagnosis and incorrect diagnoses and could lead to adequate screening of family members.\n[[In memory of the 160(th) birthday and the 80(th) anniversary of the death of Heinrich Iren\u00e4us Quincke, as well as of his description of angioedema 120 years ago].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12444526)\nG\u00f6ring, H-D\n2002-12-01\nIn the year 2002 we celebrate the 160(th) birthday and the 80(th) anniversary of the death of Heinrich Iren\u00e4us Quincke, former head of the department of internal medicine at the University of Kiel from 1878 to 1908. Moreover we remember the description of the angioedema by Quincke in the \"Monatsheften f\u00fcr Praktische Dermatologie\" 120 years ago. Because his name is so tightly linked with angioedema, Quincke's other discoveries and achievements are scarcely recalled today. Some of his other accomplishments include the invention of the lumbar puncture, the initiation of the term siderosis, the study of the resorption of inorganic iron to treat iron-deficiency anemia and his early contributions to pulmonary surgery. Quincke was the first to describe the causative organism of animal favus, which today is known as Trichophyton quinckeanum. Quincke suspected a syphilitic infection as the cause of aortic aneurysms and recommended antisyphilitic therapy. In the beginning of his career in Kiel, Quincke gave lectures not only in internal medicine but also in dermatology and venerology, pediatrics, bacteriology and public health, until chairs were established for these disciplines. Quincke was for four terms Dean of the medical faculty and in 1900 Rector of the University of Kiel.\n[The Humanistic, Societal, and Pharmaco-economic Burden of Angioedema.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27388236)\nLonghurst, Hilary; Bygum, Anette\n2016-10-01\nHereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is a rare disorder characterized by intermittent and unpredictable episodes of swelling which cause disfigurement, disability, pain, or, in case of laryngeal swelling, risk of death. Historical factors, including the intermittent nature of the disorder, the lack of awareness of this ultra-rare condition amongst medical personnel, lack of specialist centers, and limited treatment options have contributed to under-diagnosis and under-treatment of the condition. Incorrect treatment of attacks has been common, even when medical help is sought. This has lead to reduced health-seeking behavior and alternative coping strategies, sometimes even denial, in many families, while a minority of HAE-affected patients have become serial emergency room attenders with chronic pain and ongoing requirement for opiate-based painkillers. Both strategies have incurred not only physical but also psychological and economic consequences.In the last 10 years, new and effective acute therapies have been made available, some of which have also provided short-term and long-term prophylaxis options, together with a better understanding of older prophylactic drugs. Improved awareness of HAE amongst the general public, family members, and physicians has reduced the long delay in diagnosis and increased the number of patients receiving effective and up-to-date therapies to improve the physical impact of the disorder.Data on the impact of treatment on the psychological outcomes is scarce, but the limited information available suggests that access to specialist advice and treatment leads to psychological as well as physical improvement.HAE also has profound effects on individual and family economic output, directly via absenteeism from school or work and indirectly via lost opportunities. Economic improvements associated with better treatments are offset by the high cost of new acute treatments, resulting in difficult pharmaco\n[International consensus and practical guidelines on the gynecologic and obstetric management of female patients with hereditary angioedema caused by C1 inhibitor deficiency.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22197274)\nCaballero, Teresa; Farkas, Henriette; Bouillet, Laurence; Bowen, Tom; Gompel, Anne; Fagerberg, Christina; Bj\u00f6kander, Janne; Bork, Konrad; Bygum, Anette; Cicardi, Marco; de Carolis, Caterina; Frank, Michael; Gooi, Jimmy H C; Longhurst, Hilary; Mart\u00ednez-Saguer, Inmaculada; Nielsen, Erik Waage; Obtulowitz, Krystina; Perricone, Roberto; Prior, Nieves\n2012-02-01\nThere are a limited number of publications on the management of gynecologic/obstetric events in female patients with hereditary angioedema caused by C1 inhibitor deficiency (HAE-C1-INH). We sought to elaborate guidelines for optimizing the management of gynecologic/obstetric events in female patients with HAE-C1-INH. A roundtable discussion took place at the 6th C1 Inhibitor Deficiency Workshop (May 2009, Budapest, Hungary). A review of related literature in English was performed. Contraception: Estrogens should be avoided. Barrier methods, intrauterine devices, and progestins can be used. Pregnancy: Attenuated androgens are contraindicated and should be discontinued before attempting conception. Plasma-derived human C1 inhibitor concentrate (pdhC1INH) is preferred for acute treatment, short-term prophylaxis, or long-term prophylaxis. Tranexamic acid or virally inactivated fresh frozen plasma can be used for long-term prophylaxis if human plasma-derived C1-INH is not available. No safety data are available on icatibant, ecallantide, or recombinant human C1-INH (rhC1INH). Parturition: Complications during vaginal delivery are rare. Prophylaxis before labor and delivery might not be clinically indicated, but pdhC1INH therapeutic doses (20 U/kg) should be available. Nevertheless, each case should be treated based on HAE-C1-INH symptoms during pregnancy and previous labors. pdhC1INH prophylaxis is advised before forceps or vacuum extraction or cesarean section. Regional anesthesia is preferred to endotracheal intubation. Breast cancer: Attenuated androgens should be avoided. Antiestrogens can worsen angioedema symptoms. In these cases anastrozole might be an alternative. Other issues addressed include special features of HAE-C1-INH treatment in female patients, genetic counseling, infertility, abortion, lactation, menopause treatment, and endometrial cancer. A consensus for the management of female patients with HAE-C1-INH is presented.

It can affect many regions in the body, but potentially life-threatening laryngeal oedemas are of concern. Twenty-three subjects from two families were recruited for clinical data evaluation and molecular analysis at General Hospital \u0160ibenik, Croatia. Decreased levels of C1 inhibitor were detected in 12 adult patients and three young asymptomatic persons. The same novel deletion of two nucleotides on exon 3 (c.74_75delAT) was identified in all of them. A history of laryngeal oedema was present in 10 patients (83%), and all patients reported laryngeal attacks at least once a year. The delay in diagnosis decreased noticeably from the first to the last generation. We identified a novel causative mutation in SERPING1 in several affected members of two apparently unrelated families with a high frequency of laryngeal oedema. Molecular analysis of large C1-INH-HAE families will provide new insights on the genotype-phenotype relationship. Key messages Hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene, and laryngeal oedema is of concern because it can cause death by asphyxiation. A novel causative mutation in SERPING1, a deletion of two nucleotides on exon 3 (c.74_75delAT), was identified in several affected members of two apparently unrelated families with a high frequency of laryngeal oedema. Molecular analysis of large C1-INH-HAE families will provide new insights on the genotype-phenotype relationship because it appears that the mutation type may affect disease severity.\n[Measurements of Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) Allan Deviations in Space](http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20130009795) [NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp)\nEnzer, Daphna G.; Klipstein, William M.; Wang, Rabi T.; Dunn, Charles E.\n2013-01-01\nResearchers have used data from the GRAIL mission to the Moon to make the first in-flight verification of ultra-stable oscillators (USOs) with Allan deviation below 10 13 for 1-to-100-second averaging times. USOs are flown in space to provide stable timing and/or navigation signals for a variety of different science and programmatic missions. The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission is flying twin spacecraft, each with its own USO and with a Ka-band crosslink used to measure range fluctuations. Data from this crosslink can be combined in such a way as to give the relative time offsets of the two spacecrafts USOs and to calculate the Allan deviation to describe the USOs combined performance while orbiting the Moon. Researchers find the first direct in-space Allan deviations below 10(exp -13) for 1-to-100-second averaging times comparable to pre-launch data, and better than measurements from ground tracking of an X-band carrier coherent with the USO. Fluctuations in Earth s atmosphere limit measurement performance in direct-to-Earth links. Inflight USO performance verification was also performed for GRAIL s parent mission, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), using both Kband and Ka-band crosslinks.\n[Optimum Use of Acute Treatments for Hereditary Angioedema: Evidence-Based Expert Consensus](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=5857575)\nLonghurst, Hilary\n2018-01-01\nAcute treatment of hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency has become available in the last 10 years and has greatly improved patients\u2019 quality of life. Two plasma-derived C1 inhibitors (Berinert and Cinryze), a recombinant C1 inhibitor (Ruconest/Conestat alpha), a kallikrein inhibitor (Ecallantide), and a bradykinin B2 receptor inhibitor (Icatibant) are all effective. Durably good response is maintained over repeated treatments and several years. All currently available prophylactic agents are associated with breakthrough attacks, therefore an acute treatment plan is essential for every patient. Experience has shown that higher doses of C1 inhibitor than previously recommended may be desirable, although only recombinant C1 inhibitor has been subject to full dose\u2013response evaluation. Treatment of early symptoms of an attack, with any licensed therapy, results in milder symptoms, more rapid resolution and shorter duration of attack, compared with later treatment. All therapies have been shown to be well-tolerated, with low risk of serious adverse events. Plasma-derived C1 inhibitors have a reassuring safety record regarding lack of transmission of virus or other infection. Thrombosis has been reported in association with plasma-derived C1 inhibitor in some case series. Ruconest was associated with anaphylaxis in a single rabbit-allergic volunteer, but no further anaphylaxis has been reported in those not allergic to rabbits despite, in a few cases, prior IgE sensitization to rabbit or milk protein. Icatibant is associated with high incidence of local reactions but not with systemic effects. Ecallantide may cause anaphylactoid reactions and is given under supervision. For children and pregnant women, plasma-derived C1 inhibitor has the best evidence of safety and currently remains first-line treatment.

O. S.\n2013-01-01\nBackground Attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) are unpredictable and, if affecting the upper airway, can be lethal. Icatibant is used for physician- or patient self-administered symptomatic treatment of HAE attacks in adults. Its mode of action includes disruption of the bradykinin pathway via blockade of the bradykinin B2 receptor. Early treatment is believed to shorten attack duration and prevent severe outcomes; however, evidence to support these benefits is lacking. Objective To examine the impact of timing of icatibant administration on the duration and resolution of HAE type I and II attacks. Methods The Icatibant Outcome Survey is an international, prospective, observational study for patients treated with icatibant. Data on timings and outcomes of icatibant treatment for HAE attacks were collected between July 2009\u2013February 2012. A mixed-model of repeated measures was performed for 426 attacks in 136 HAE type I and II patients. Results Attack duration was significantly shorter in patients treated <1 hour of attack onset compared with those treated \u22651 hour (6.1 hours versus 16.8 hours [p<0.001]). Similar significant effects were observed for <2 hours versus \u22652 hours (7.2 hours versus 20.2 hours [p<0.001]) and <5 hours versus \u22655 hours (8.0 hours versus 23.5 hours [p<0.001]). Treatment within 1 hour of attack onset also significantly reduced time to attack resolution (5.8 hours versus 8.8 hours [p<0.05]). Self-administrators were more likely to treat early and experience shorter attacks than those treated by a healthcare professional. Conclusion Early blockade of the bradykinin B2 receptor with icatibant, particularly within the first hour of attack onset, significantly reduced attack duration and time to attack resolution.

We present an audit report and a systematic review of published observational studies on PIROLA occurrence in acute ischaemic stroke patients. Clinical files of patients treated in the stroke unit of Bourg-en-Bresse General Hospital (France) from January 2010 to December 2012 were reviewed, and MEDLINE (inception to May 2013) were searched and bibliographies/citations of retrieved articles examined for evidence of PIROLA. Of the 129 acute ischaemic stroke patients treated at Bourg-en-Bresse between 2010 and 2012, four patients, all receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), developed a PIROLA (cumulative incidence rate: 32\u2030). The complication started within an hour of receiving r-tPA and integrally resolved within 3-24 hours, with antihistamines/steroid treatment in two patients. The systematic review identified 27 studies, totalising with ours, over 9050 acute ischaemic stroke patients from 12 countries, among whom 100 (cumulative incidence rate: 17\u2030; 95% confidence intervals: 8-26), developed a PIROLA within 6-240 minutes of receiving r-tPA, 0-100% of them occurring among patients on ACEI. The complication was contralateral to the stroke location in 47% cases, ipsilateral in 14%, and bilateral in 39%; and resolved within 24 hours with treatment in 90%. No related death was recorded. About 17\u2030 acute ischaemic stroke patients receiving r-tPA develop PIROLA, occurring essentially among those on concomitant ACEI. PIROLA occurrence should be actively monitored, particularly within the first few hours as some may require urgent lifesaving procedures.\n[Expert perspectives on hereditary angioedema: Key areas for advancements in care across the patient journey](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=5244276)\nBa\u015f, Murat; Bernstein, Jonathan A.; Boccon-Gibod, Isabelle; Bova, Maria; Dempster, John; Grumach, Anete Sevciovic; Magerl, Markus; Poarch, Kimberly; Ferreira, Manuel Branco\n2016-01-01\nBackground: Published literature documents the substantial burden of hereditary angioedema (HAE) with C1 inhibitor deficiency on the quality of life and work productivity of patients. However, despite advances in the field and the availability of guidelines to advise health care providers (HCP) on the diagnosis and management of HAE, there are still many challenges to overcome. For example, delayed diagnosis and misdiagnosis are common, and treatment practices vary worldwide. Objective: An international expert panel was convened to consider opportunities for improvements that would benefit patients with HAE. Methods: Based on professional and personal experiences, the experts developed schematics to describe the journey of patients through the following stages: (1) onset of symptoms and initial evaluation; (2) referral/diagnosis; and (3) management of HAE. More importantly, the panel identified key areas in which it was possible to optimize the support provided to patients and HCPs along this journey. Results: Overall, this approach highlighted the need for wider dissemination of algorithms and scientific data to more effectively educate HCPs from multiple disciplines and the need for more research to inform appropriate treatment decisions. Furthermore, HAE awareness campaigns, accurate online information, and referral to patient advocacy groups were all considered helpful approaches to support patients. Conclusion: More detailed and widespread information on the diagnosis and management of HAE is needed and may lead to advancements in care throughout the journey of the patient with HAE.

Plasma levels of C1INH following 294 administrations of rhC1INH in 133 subjects were fitted using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. The model was used to simulate maximal C1INH levels for the proposed dosing scheme. A one-compartment model with Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics described the data. Baseline C1INH levels were 0.901 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.839-0.968] and 0.176 U ml(-1) (95% CI: 0.154-0.200) in healthy volunteers and HAE patients, respectively. The volume of distribution of rhC1INH was 2.86 l (95% CI: 2.68-3.03). The maximal rate of elimination and the concentration corresponding to half this maximal rate were 1.63 U ml(-1) h(-1) (95% CI: 1.41-1.88) and 1.60 U ml(-1) (95% CI: 1.14-2.24), respectively, for healthy volunteers and symptomatic HAE patients. The maximal elimination rate was 36% lower in asymptomatic HAE patients. Peak C1INH levels did not change upon repeated administration of rhC1INH. Bodyweight was found to be an important predictor of the volume of distribution. Simulations of the proposed dosing scheme predicted peak C1INH concentrations above the lower level of the normal range (0.7 U ml(-1)) for at least 94% of all patients. The population PK model for C1INH supports a dosing scheme on a 50 U kg(-1) basis up to 84 kg, with a fixed dose of 4200 U above 84 kg. The PK of rhC1INH following repeat administration are consistent with the PK following the first administration. \u00a9 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.\n[Sobre o uso das s\u00e9ries de Puiseux em mecanica celeste](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003BASBr..23...35M) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html)\nMiloni, O.

In subjects treated with rhC1INH, we retrospectively analysed the frequency and clinical relevance of pre-exposure and potentially newly induced IgE antibodies against rabbit and other animal allergens including cow's milk by the ImmunoCAP(\u00ae) Specific IgE blood test system. 130 HAE patients and 14 healthy subjects received 300 administrations of rhC1INH, 65 subjects (47.4 %) on one occasion; 72 (52.6 %) on at least two occasions (range 2-12; median 2). Five subjects had pre-existing anti-rabbit epithelium IgE; the subject with the highest levels and a previously undisclosed rabbit allergy developed an anaphylactic reaction upon first exposure to rhC1INH, whereas the other four subjects with lower pre-existing IgE levels (Class 1-3), did not. No other anaphylactic reactions were identified in any of the subjects exposed to rhC1INH. Analysis of post-exposure samples revealed that the risk of inducing new or boosting existing IgE responses to rabbit or cow's milk allergens was negligible. The propensity of rhC1INH to induce IgE antibodies following repeated administration of rhC1INH is low. Subjects with substantially elevated anti-rabbit epithelium IgE antibodies and/or clinical allergy to rabbits may have an increased risk for an allergic reaction. No other risk factors for allergic reactions to rhC1INH have been identified.\n[Anabolic androgen use in the management of hereditary angioedema: Not so cheap after all.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28283277)\nTse, Kevin Y; Zuraw, Bruce L; Chen, Qiaoling; Christiansen, Sandra C\n2017-04-01\nHereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (HAE) is a rare, life-threatening disease that imposes a significant burden on affected patients. 17\u03b1-alkylated androgens (anabolic androgens) decrease attack frequency and severity but carry the risk of potentially serious dose-related adverse effects. Despite the emergence of targeted therapies for HAE, continued anabolic androgen use has been driven in part by their low cost. To examine the hidden cost of anabolic androgen use related to the risk of developing non-HAE comorbidities. Patients with HAE were identified in the Southern California Kaiser Permanente database using clinical and laboratory findings compatible with HAE. These patients were stratified into anabolic androgen exposed and nonexposed groups. Matched controls were selected from the Kaiser database who did not have HAE or anabolic androgen exposure. Using multivariate analysis, we determined the number of non-HAE comorbidities linked to anabolic androgen use. We next determined the association between dosing and increasing exposure to anabolic androgens and the likelihood of having various comorbidities. Patients with HAE exposed to anabolic androgens had a 28% increase (P = .04) in non-HAE comorbidities when compared with their matched (nonexposed) controls. With each gram per month increase in exposure, a 12% increase in non-HAE comorbidities is observed (P < .01). The most commonly occurring non-HAE comorbidities were psychiatric, muscle cramps, obesity, and hyperlipidemia. Our data suggest that long-term anabolic androgen use enhances the risk of developing comorbid health conditions, thus amplifying the cost of care. Our report provides additional support for the preferred use of newer, targeted therapies for the management of HAE. Copyright \u00a9 2017 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy are essential. This update and revision of the global guideline for HAE provides up-to-date consensus recommendations for the management of HAE. In the development of this update and revision of the guideline, an international expert panel reviewed the existing evidence and developed 20 recommendations that were discussed, finalized and consented during the guideline consensus conference in June 2016 in Vienna. The final version of this update and revision of the guideline incorporates the contributions of a board of expert reviewers and the endorsing societies. The goal of this guideline update and revision is to provide clinicians and their patients with guidance that will assist them in making rational decisions in the management of HAE with deficient C1-inhibitor (type 1) and HAE with dysfunctional C1-inhibitor (type 2). The key clinical questions covered by these recommendations are: (1) How should HAE-1/2 be defined and classified?, (2) How should HAE-1/2 be diagnosed?, (3) Should HAE-1/2 patients receive prophylactic and/or on-demand treatment and what treatment options should be used?, (4) Should HAE-1/2 management be different for special HAE-1/2 patient groups such as pregnant/lactating women or children?, and (5) Should HAE-1/2 management incorporate self-administration of therapies and patient support measures? \u00a9 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Methods Plasma levels of C1INH following 294 administrations of rhC1INH in 133 subjects were fitted using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. The model was used to simulate maximal C1INH levels for the proposed dosing scheme. Results A one-compartment model with Michaelis\u2013Menten elimination kinetics described the data. Baseline C1INH levels were 0.901 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.839\u20130.968] and 0.176 U ml\u22121 (95% CI: 0.154\u20130.200) in healthy volunteers and HAE patients, respectively. The volume of distribution of rhC1INH was 2.86 l (95% CI: 2.68\u20133.03). The maximal rate of elimination and the concentration corresponding to half this maximal rate were 1.63 U ml\u22121 h\u22121 (95% CI: 1.41\u20131.88) and 1.60 U ml\u22121 (95% CI: 1.14\u20132.24), respectively, for healthy volunteers and symptomatic HAE patients. The maximal elimination rate was 36% lower in asymptomatic HAE patients. Peak C1INH levels did not change upon repeated administration of rhC1INH. Bodyweight was found to be an important predictor of the volume of distribution. Simulations of the proposed dosing scheme predicted peak C1INH concentrations above the lower level of the normal range (0.7 U ml\u22121) for at least 94% of all patients. Conclusions The population PK model for C1INH supports a dosing scheme on a 50 U kg\u22121 basis up to 84 kg, with a fixed dose of 4200 U above 84 kg. The PK of rhC1INH following repeat administration are consistent with the PK following the first administration.

The decomposition reaction of p-chlorophenol follows pseudo-first-order kinetics. The enhancement factors of p-chlorophenol and its CODcr under US/O3 system reached 63% and 237% respectively. The main intermediates during the decomposition include catechol, hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, phenol, fumaric acid, maleic acid, oxalic acid and formic acid. The decomposition mechanism of p-chlorophenol was also discussed.

They are considered to involve dysregulation of the arachidonic acid pathway; however, this mechanism has not been confirmed for NIUA. In this work, we assessed copy number variations (CNVs) in eight of the main genes involved in the arachidonic acid pathway and their possible genetic association with NIUA. CNVs in ALOX5, LTC4S, PTGS1, PTGS2, PTGER1, PTGER2, PTGER3, and PTGER4 were analyzed using TaqMan copy number assays. Genotyping was carried out by real-time quantitative PCR. Individual genotypes were assigned using the CopyCaller Software. Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad prism 5, PLINK, EPIDAT, and R version 3.1.2. A total of 151 cases and 139 controls were analyzed during the discovery phase and 148 cases and 140 controls were used for replication. CNVs in open reading frames were found for ALOX5, PTGER1, PTGER3, and PTGER4. Statistically significant differences in the CNV frequency between NIUA and controls were found for ALOX5 (Pc=0.017) and PTGER1 (Pc=1.22E-04). This study represents the first analysis showing an association between CNVs in exonic regions of ALOX5 and PTGER1 and NIUA. This suggests a role of CNVs in this pathology that should be explored further.\n[Icatibant, an inhibitor of bradykinin receptor 2, for hereditary angioedema attacks: prospective experimental single-cohort study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25054967)\nCampos, Regis Albuquerque; Valle, Solange Oliveira Rodrigues; Fran\u00e7a, Alfeu Tavares; Cordeiro, Elisabete; Serpa, Faradiba Sarquis; Mello, Yara Ferreira; Malheiros, Teresinha; Toledo, Eliana; Mansour, Elie; Fusaro, Gustavo; Grumach, Anete Sevciovic\n2014-01-01\nHereditary angioedema (HAE) with C1 inhibitor deficiency manifests as recurrent episodes of edema involving the skin, upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. It can be lethal due to asphyxia. The aim here was to evaluate the response to therapy for these attacks using icatibant, an inhibitor of the bradykinin receptor, which was recently introduced into Brazil. Prospective experimental single-cohort study on the efficacy and safety of icatibant for HAE patients. Patients with a confirmed HAE diagnosis were enrolled according to symptoms and regardless of the time since onset of the attack. Icatibant was administered in accordance with the protocol that has been approved in Brazil. Symptom severity was assessed continuously and adverse events were monitored. 24 attacks in 20 HAE patients were treated (female/male 19:1; 19-55 years; median 29 years of age). The symptoms were: subcutaneous edema (22/24); abdominal pain (15/24) and upper airway obstruction (10/24). The time taken until onset of relief was: 5-10 minutes (5/24; 20.8%); 10-20 (5/24; 20.8%); 20-30 (8/24; 33.4%); 30-60 (5/24; 20.8%); and 2 hours (1/24; 4.3%). The time taken for complete resolution of symptoms ranged from 4.3 to 33.4 hours. Adverse effects were only reported at injection sites. Mild to moderate erythema and/or feelings of burning were reported by 15/24 patients, itching by 3 and no adverse effects in 6. HAE type I patients who received icatibant responded promptly; most achieved improved symptom severity within 30 minutes. Local adverse events occurred in 75% of the patients.\n[The Icatibant Outcome Survey: experience of hereditary angioedema management from six European countries.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28370444)\nCaballero, T; Aberer, W; Longhurst, H J; Maurer, M; Zanichelli, A; Perrin, A; Bouillet, L; Andresen, I\n2017-07-01\nHereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is a rare, potentially fatal, bradykinin-mediated disease. Icatibant is a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist originally approved in 2008 in the European Union and 2011 in the United States as an acute therapy option for HAE attacks in adults. To compare demographics, disease characteristics and treatment outcomes of icatibant-treated HAE attacks in patients with C1-INH-HAE enrolled in the Icatibant Outcome Survey across six European countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. The Icatibant Outcome Survey [IOS; Shire, Zug, Switzerland (NCT01034969)] is an international observational study monitoring the safety and effectiveness of icatibant. Descriptive, retrospective analyses compared IOS country data derived during July 2009-April 2015. Overall, 481 patients with C1-INH-HAE provided demographic data. A significant difference across countries in age at onset (P = 0.003) and baseline attack frequency (P < 0.001) was found although no significant differences were found with respect to gender (majority female; P = 0.109), age at diagnosis (P = 0.182) or delay in diagnosis (P = 0.059). Icatibant was used to treat 1893 attacks in 325 patients with majority self-administration in all countries. Overall, significant differences (all P < 0.001) were found across countries in time to treatment [median 1.8 h; median range: 0.0 (Germany-Austria) to 4.4 (France) h], time to resolution [median 6.5 h; median range: 3 (Germany-Austria) to 12 (France) h] and attack duration [median 10.5 h; median range: 3.1 (Germany-Austria) to 18.5 (France) h]. These data form the first European cross-country comparison of disease characteristics and icatibant use in patients with C1-INH-HAE who are enrolled in IOS. International variation in icatibant practice and treatment outcomes across the six European countries assessed highlight the need to further investigate the range of country-specific parameters\n[Uso de la punci\u00f3n lumbar en la evaluaci\u00f3n de sepsis neonatal tard\u00eda en reci\u00e9n nacidos de bajo peso al nacer](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=5544347)\nZea-Vera, A; Tur\u00edn, CG; Rueda, MS; Guill\u00e9n-Pinto, D; Medina-Alva, P; Tori, A; Rivas, M; Zegarra, J; Casta\u00f1eda, A; Cam, L; Ochoa, TJ\n2017-01-01\nRESUMEN El objetivo de este estudio fue analizar el uso de la punci\u00f3n lumbar (PL) en las sospechas de sepsis neonatal tard\u00eda.

HAE is caused by mutations affecting the C1 inhibitor gene, SERPING1, resulting in low levels of C1 inhibitor (Type I HAE) or normal levels of ineffective C1 inhibitor (Type II HAE). A nationwide survey identified nine unrelated families with HAE in Slovenia, among whom 17 individuals from eight families were recruited for genetic analyses. A diagnosis of HAE was established in the presence of clinical and laboratory criteria (low C1 inhibitor antigenic levels and/or function), followed up by a positive family history. Genetic studies were carried out using PCR and sequencing to detect SERPING1 mutations in promoter, noncoding exon 1, the 7 coding exons, and exon-intron boundaries. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was performed in order to search for large deletions/duplications in SERPING1 gene. A mutation responsible for HAE was identified in patients from seven families with the disease. In HAE type I families, one previously reported substitution (Gln67Stop, c.265C>T) and four novel mutations were identified. The new mutations included two missense substitutions, Ser128Phe (c.449C>T), and Glu429Lys (c.1351G>A), together with two frameshift mutations, indel (c.49delGinsTT) and deletion (c.593_594delCT). Both families with HAE type II harbored the two well-known substitutions affecting the arginyl residue at the reactive center in exon 8, Arg444Cys (c.1396C>T) and Arg444His (c.1397G>A), respectively. In one patient only the homozygous variant g.566T>C (c.-21T>C) was identified.

This disorder is caused by mutations in the C1NH gene, many of which have been described primarily in European patients. However, the genetic cause of HAE in Middle Eastern Arab patients has not yet been determined. Four unrelated Arab families, in which 15 patients were diagnosed with HAE, were studied. DNA from 13 patients was analyzed for mutations in the C1NH gene by DNA sequencing. Three novel and 2 recurrent mutations were identified in the C1NH gene of HAE patients. In family 1, the patient was heterozygous for a novel c.856C>T and a recurrent c.1361T>A missense mutation encoding for p.Arg264Cys and p.Val432Glu, respectively. In patients from family 2, a novel c.509C>T missense mutation encoding for a p.Ser148Phe was identified. In patients from family 3, a novel c.1142delC nonsense mutation encoding for a p.Ala359AlafsX15 was discovered. In family 4, a recurrent c.1397G>A missense mutation encoding for a p.Arg444His was present. This is the first ever report of C1NH gene mutations in Middle Eastern Arab patients. Our study suggests that, despite the numerous existing mutations in the C1NH gene, there are novel and recurrent mutations in HAE patients of non-European origin. We conclude that the spectrum of C1NH gene mutations in HAE patients is wider due to the likely presence of novel and recurrent mutations in patients of other ethnicities. 2009 S.

Objective: This analysis evaluated Berinert Patient Registry data regarding IV pnfC1-INH used as long-term prophylaxis (LTP). Methods: The international registry (2010\u20132014) collected prospective and retrospective usage, dosing, and safety data on individuals who used pnfC1-INH for any reason. Results: The registry included data on 47 subjects (80.9% female subjects; mean age, 44.8 years), which reflected 4082 infusions categorized as LTP and a total of 430.2 months of LTP administration. The median absolute dose of pnfC1-INH given for LTP was 1000 IU (range, 500\u20133000 IU), with a median time interval between infusion and a subsequent pnfC1-INH\u2013treated attack of 72.0 hours (range, 0.0\u2013166.4 hours). Fifteen subjects (31.9%) had no pnfC1-INH\u2013treated HAE attacks within 7 days after pnfC1-INH infusion for LTP; 32 subjects (68.1%) experienced 246 attacks, with rates of 0.06 attacks per infusion and 0.57 attacks per month. A total of 81 adverse events were reported in 16 subjects (34.0%) (0.02 events per infusion; 0.19 events per month); only 3 adverse events were considered related to pnfC1-INH (noncardiac chest pain, postinfusion headache, deep vein thrombosis in a subject with an IV port). Conclusion: In this international registry, IV pnf-C1-INH given as LTP for HAE was safe and efficacious, with a low rate of attacks that required pnfC1-INH treatment, particularly within the first several days after LTP administration.

Without any standardized evaluation, two main problems appear: heterogeneity between studies and ineffective patient's evaluation. Therefore, Universal Scale in Oral Surgery (USOS) for patient's psycho-emotional status rating has previously been proposed by authors. The aim of present study is to assess the clinical effectivity and validate the Universal Scale in Oral Surgery in case of outpatient tooth extraction for adult healthy patients. Clinical trial to validate the USOS for patient's psycho-emotional status rating was performed. In total 90 patients, that came for outpatient dental extraction to Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department ambulatory, were enrolled in clinical trial. Patients filled self-reported questionnaires before the procedure. Operating surgeon rated USOS for patient's psycho-emotional status rating doctor's part questionnaire after the procedure. 4 - 6 weeks later all patients were asked to fill USOS for patient's psycho-emotional status rating questionnaire retrospectively. According to the statistical analysis, the final composition of USOS for patient's psycho-emotional status rating that would fit to reliability coefficient should be composed from 6 patient part questions and 3 general doctor part questions.

HAE is characterized by recurrent attacks of intense, massive, localized subcutaneous edema involving the extremities, genitalia, face, or trunk, or submucosal edema of upper airway or bowels. These symptoms may be disabling, have a dramatic impact on quality of life, and can be life-threatening when affecting the upper airways. Because the manifestations and severity of HAE are highly variable and unpredictable, patients need individualized care to reduce the burden of HAE on daily life. Although effective therapy for the treatment of HAE attacks has been available in many countries for more than 30 years, until recently, there were no agents approved in the United States to treat HAE acutely. Therefore, prophylactic therapy is an integral part of HAE treatment in the United States and for selected patients worldwide. Routine long-term prophylaxis with either attenuated androgens or C1-esterase inhibitor has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of HAE attacks. Therapy with attenuated androgens, a mainstay of treatment in the past, has been marked by concern about potential adverse effects. C1-esterase inhibitor works directly on the complement and contact plasma cascades to reduce bradykinin release, which is the primary pathologic mechanism in HAE. Different approaches to long-term prophylactic therapy can be used to successfully manage HAE when tailored to meet the needs of the individual patient.

G.; Garc\u00eda-Mart\u00edn, Elena; Gu\u00e9ant, Jean-Louis; Canto, Gabriela; Blanca, Miguel\n2014-01-01\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most consumed drugs worldwide because of their efficacy and utility in the treatment of pain and inflammatory diseases. However, they are also responsible for an important number of adverse effects including hypersensitivity reactions. The most important group of these reactions is triggered by non-immunological, pharmacological mechanisms catalogued under the denomination of cross-intolerance (CRI), with acute urticaria/angioedema induced by multiple NSAIDs (MNSAID-UA) the most frequently associated clinical entity. A recent genome-wide association study identified the gene encoding the centrosomal protein of 68 KDa (CEP68) as the major locus associated with aspirin intolerance susceptibility in asthmatics. In this study, we aimed to assess the role of this locus in susceptibility to CRI to NSAIDs by examining 53 common gene variants in a total of 635 patients that were classified as MNSAID-UA (n = 399), airway exacerbations (n = 110) or blended pattern (n = 126), and 425 controls. We found in the MNSAID-UA group a number of variants (17) associated (lowest p-value = 1.13\u00d710\u22126), including the non-synonymous Gly74Ser variant (rs7572857) previously associated with aspirin intolerance susceptibility in asthmatics. Although not being significant in the context of multiple testing, eight of these variants were also associated with exacerbated respiratory disease or blended reactions. Our results suggest that CEP68 gene variants may play an important role in MNSAID-UA susceptibility and, despite the different regulatory mechanisms involved depending on the specific affected organ, in the development of hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs.

Many of the previous recommendations have not been adapted to pediatric patients. We intended to produce consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients with C1-INH-HAE. During an expert panel meeting that took place during the 9th C1 Inhibitor Deficiency Workshop in Budapest, 2015 (www.haenet.hu), pediatric data were presented and discussed and a consensus was developed by voting. The symptoms of C1-INH-HAE often present in childhood. Differential diagnosis can be difficult as abdominal pain is common in pediatric C1-INH-HAE, but also commonly occurs in the general pediatric population. The early onset of symptoms may predict a more severe subsequent course of the disease. Before the age of 1 year, C1-INH levels may be lower than in adults; therefore, it is advisable to confirm the diagnosis after the age of one year. All neonates/infants with an affected C1-INH-HAE family member should be screened for C1-INH deficiency. Pediatric patients should always carry a C1-INH-HAE information card and medicine for emergency use. The regulatory approval status of the drugs for prophylaxis and for acute treatment is different in each country. Plasma-derived C1-INH, recombinant C1-INH, and ecallantide are the only agents licensed for the acute treatment of pediatric patients. Clinical trials are underway with additional drugs. It is recommended to follow up patients in an HAE comprehensive care center. The pediatric-focused international consensus for the diagnosis and management of C1-INH-HAE patients was created. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

The Russian Segment provides permanent crew quarters (Kayutas) for two crewmembers in the Service Module. The TeSS provides limited electrical, communication, and ventilation functionality. A new permanent rack sized USOS ISS Crew Quarters (CQ) is being developed. Up to four CQs can be installed into the Node 2 element to increase the ISS crewmember size to six. The new CQs will provide private crewmember space with enhanced acoustic noise mitigation, integrated radiation reduction material, controllable airflow, communication equipment, redundant electrical systems, and redundant caution and warning systems. The rack sized CQ is a system with multiple crewmember restraints, adjustable lighting, controllable ventilation, and interfaces that allow each crewmember to personalize their CQ workspace. Providing an acoustically quiet and visually isolated environment, while ensuring crewmember safety, is critical for obtaining crewmember rest and comfort to enable long term crewmember performance. The numerous human factor, engineering, and program considerations during the concept, design, and prototyping are outlined in the paper.\n[Inversor Resonante de Tres Elementos L-LC con Caracteristica Cortocircuitable para Aplicaciones de Calentamiento por Induccion](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998PhDT........95E) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html)\nEspi Huerta, Jose Miguel\nseccion de entrada mediante un mayor o menor aporte de corriente al puente.

However, despite the use of long-term prophylaxis (LTP), breakthrough attacks are known to occur. We used data from the Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS) to evaluate the characteristics of breakthrough attacks and the effectiveness of icatibant as a treatment option. Data on LTP use, attacks, and treatments were recorded. Attack characteristics, treatment characteristics, and outcomes (time to treatment, time to resolution, and duration of attack) were compared for attacks that occurred with versus without LTP. Data on 3228 icatibant-treated attacks from 448 patients with C1-INH-HAE were analyzed; 30.1% of attacks occurred while patients were using LTP. Attack rate, attack severity, and the distribution of attack sites were similar across all types of LTP used, and were comparable to the results found in patients who did not receive LTP. Attacks were successfully treated with icatibant; 82.5% of all breakthrough attacks were treated with a single icatibant injection without C1-INH rescue medication. Treatment outcomes were comparable for breakthrough attacks across all LTP types, and for attacks without LTP. Patients who use LTP should be aware that breakthrough attacks can occur, and such attacks can be severe. Thus, patients with C1-INH-HAE using LTP should have emergency treatment readily available. Data from IOS show that icatibant is effective for the treatment of breakthrough attacks.

Porphyromonas gingivalis, a keystone pathogen for periodontitis, utilizes the T9SS to transport many proteins including the gingipain virulence factors across the outer membrane and attach them to the cell surface via a sortase-like mechanism. At least 11 proteins have been identified as components of the T9SS including PorK, PorL, PorM, PorN and PorP, however the precise roles of most of these proteins have not been elucidated and the structural organization of these components is unknown. In this study, we purified PorK and PorN complexes from P. gingivalis and using electron microscopy we have shown that PorN and the PorK lipoprotein interact to form a 50 nm diameter ring-shaped structure containing approximately 32-36 subunits of each protein. The formation of these rings was dependent on both PorK and PorN, but was independent of PorL, PorM and PorP. PorL and PorM were found to form a separate stable complex. PorK and PorN were protected from proteinase K cleavage when present in undisrupted cells, but were rapidly degraded when the cells were lysed, which together with bioinformatic analyses suggests that these proteins are exposed in the periplasm and anchored to the outer membrane via the PorK lipid. Chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the interaction between PorK and PorN and further revealed that they interact with the PG0189 outer membrane protein. Furthermore, we established that PorN was required for the stable expression of PorK, PorL and PorM. Collectively, these results suggest that the ring-shaped PorK/N complex may form part of the secretion channel of the T9SS.

The T9SS is poorly characterized but a number of proteins involved in the assembly of the secretion apparatus in the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis have been identified based on genome substractive analyses. Among these proteins, PorY, and PorX encode typical two-component system (TCS) sensor and CheY-like response regulator respectively. Although the porX and porY genes do not localize at the same genetic locus, it has been proposed that PorXY form a bona fide TCS. Deletion of porX in P. gingivalis causes a slight decrease of the expression of a number of other T9SS genes, including sov, porT, porP, porK, porL, porM, porN, and porY. Here, we show that PorX and the soluble cytoplasmic domain of PorY interact. Using electrophoretic mobility shift, DNA-protein co-purification and heterologous host expression assays, we demonstrate that PorX does not bind T9SS gene promoters and does not directly regulate expression of the T9SS genes. Finally, we show that PorX interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of PorL, a component of the T9SS membrane core complex and propose that the CheY-like PorX protein might be involved in the dynamics of the T9SS.

The general management as well as the specific therapy will have to consider the various trigger factors involved, the differences in the response rates to antiallergic drugs and the different prognoses of the urticaria subforms. Therefore this article will first briefly describe the most frequent subforms of urticaria and relapsing angioedema, and then discuss their management and treatment.\n[Effectiveness of icatibant for treatment of hereditary angioedema attacks is not affected by body weight: findings from the Icatibant Outcome Survey, a cohort observational study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29599966)\nCaballero, Teresa; Zanichelli, Andrea; Aberer, Werner; Maurer, Marcus; Longhurst, Hilary J; Bouillet, Laurence; Andresen, Irmgard\n2018-01-01\nIcatibant is a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist used for the treatment of hereditary angioedema attacks resulting from C1-inhibitor deficiency. Treatment is not adjusted by body weight however the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the effectiveness of icatibant is not documented in the literature. We examined disease characteristics and icatibant treatment effectiveness in patients stratified by BMI in the Icatibant Outcome Survey, an ongoing, international, observational study monitoring the real-world safety and effectiveness of icatibant. Attack and treatment characteristics as well as outcomes following treatment with icatibant were compared among patients with underweight, normal, overweight, and obese BMI. Data from 2697 icatibant-treated attacks in 342 patients (3.5, 44.7, 34.8, and 17.0% patients of underweight, normal, overweight, and obese BMI, respectively) were analyzed. There was no significant difference in the frequency and severity of attacks across BMI groups, although obese patients tended to have more attacks of high severity. There was no impact of BMI on the frequency of laryngeal attacks, but patients with normal BMI had fewer cutaneous attacks and more abdominal attacks. Most attacks (71.9-83.8%) were treated with a single icatibant injection without the need for rescue with plasma-derived C1-inhibitor (pdC1-INH), regardless of BMI. Patients with obese BMI used pdC1-INH as rescue treatment more often (P < 0.0001; P = 0.0232 excluding 2 outliers) and treated attacks earlier than patients with normal BMI (P = 0.007). Furthermore, time to resolution and duration of attack were shorter for patients with high BMI (P < 0.001 for overweight and P < 0.05 for obese versus normal). Overall, icatibant was comparatively effective in treating attacks in patients across all BMI groups.

In particular, cysteine proteinases named gingipains are of interest given their abilities to degrade host proteins and process other virulence factors such as fimbriae. Gingipains are translocated on the cell surface or into the extracellular milieu by the Por secretion system (PorSS), which consists of a number of membrane or periplasmic proteins including PorK, PorL, PorM, PorN, PorO, PorP, PorQ, PorT, PorU, PorV (PG27, LptO), PorW and Sov. To identify proteins other than gingipains secreted by the PorSS, we compared the proteomes of P. gingivalis strains kgp rgpA rgpB (PorSS-proficient strain) and kgp rgpA rgpB porK (PorSS-deficient strain) using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and peptide-mass fingerprinting. Sixteen spots representing 10 different proteins were present in the particle-free culture supernatant of the PorSS-proficient strain but were absent or faint in that of the PorSS-deficient strain. These identified proteins possessed the C-terminal domains (CTDs), which had been suggested to form the CTD protein family. These results indicate that the PorSS is used for secretion of a number of proteins other than gingipains and that the CTDs of the proteins are associated with the PorSS-dependent secretion. \u00a9 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

The conditional deletion of hepatic POR gene expression in mice results in a marked decrease in plasma cholesterol levels counterbalanced by the accumulation of triglycerides in lipid droplets in hepatocytes. To evaluate the role of cholesterol and bile acid synthesis in this hepatic lipidosis, as well as the possible role of lipid transport from peripheral tissues, we developed a stable, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated cell culture model for the suppression of POR. POR mRNA and protein expression were decreased by greater than 50% in McArdle-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells 10 days after transfection with a POR-siRNA expression plasmid, and POR expression was nearly completely extinguished by day 20. Immunofluorescent analysis revealed a marked accumulation of lipid droplets in cells by day 15, accompanied by a nearly 2-fold increase in cellular triglyceride content, replicating the lipidosis seen in hepatic POR-null mouse liver. In contrast, suppression of CYP51A1 (lanosterol demethylase) did not result in lipid accumulation, indicating that loss of cholesterol synthesis is not the basis for this lipidosis. Indeed, addition of cholesterol to the medium appeared to augment the lipidosis in POR-suppressed cells, whereas removal of lipids from the medium reversed the lipidosis. Oxysterols did not accumulate in POR-suppressed cells, discounting a role for liver X receptor in stimulating triglyceride synthesis, but addition of chenodeoxycholate significantly repressed lipid accumulation, suggesting that the absence of bile acids and loss of farnesoid X receptor stimulation lead to excessive triglyceride synthesis.

ACE and DPPIV degrade substance P, an edema-forming peptide. The contribution of impaired degradation of substance P by DPPIV to the pathogenesis of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema is unknown. We sought to determine whether DPPIV deficiency results in increased edema formation during ACE inhibition. We also sought to develop an animal model using magnetic resonance imaging to quantify ACE inhibitor-induced edema. The effect of genetic DPPIV deficiency on peritracheal edema was assessed in F344 rats after treatment with saline, captopril (2.5 mg/kg), or captopril plus the neurokinin receptor antagonist spantide (100 mug/kg) by using serial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Serum dipeptidyl peptidase activity was dramatically decreased in DPPIV-deficient rats (P < .001). The volume of peritracheal edema was significantly greater in captopril-treated DPPIV-deficient rats than in saline-treated DPPIV-deficient rats (P = .001), saline-treated rats of the normal substrain (P < .001), or captopril-treated rats of the normal substrain (P = .001). Cotreatment with spantide attenuated peritracheal edema in captopril-treated DPPIV-deficient rats (P = .005 vs captopril-treated DPPIV-deficient rats and P = .57 vs saline-treated DPPIV-deficient rats). DPPIV deficiency predisposes to peritracheal edema formation when ACE is inhibited through a neurokinin receptor-dependent mechanism. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful for modeling ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema in rats. Genetic or environmental factors that decrease DPPIV activity might increase the risk of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.\nKaplan, Allen P\n2014-01-01\nDiseases which have been demonstrated to be caused by increased plasma levels of bradykinin all have angioedema as the common major clinical manifestation. Angioedema due to therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is caused by suppressed bradykinin degradation so that it accumulates. This occurs because ACE metabolizes bradykinin by removal of Phe-Arg from the C-terminus, which inactivates it. By contrast, angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (either hereditary types I and II, or acquired) is caused by bradykinin overproduction. C1 inhibitor inhibits factor XIIa, kallikrein and activity associated with the prekallikrein-HK (high-molecular-weight kininogen) complex. In its absence, uncontrolled activation of the plasma bradykinin cascade is seen once there has been an initiating stimulus. C4 levels are low in all types of C1 inhibitor deficiency due to the instability of C1 (C1r, in particular) such that some activated C1 always circulates and depletes C4. In the hereditary disorder, formation of factor XIIf (factor XII fragment) during attacks of swelling causes C4 levels to drop toward zero, and C2 levels decline. A kinin-like molecule, once thought to be a cleavage product derived from C2 that contributes to the increased vascular permeability seen in hereditary angioedema (HAE), is now thought to be an artifact, i.e. no such molecule is demonstrable. The acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency is associated with clonal disorders of B cell hyperreactivity, including lymphoma and monoclonal gammopathy. Most cases have an IgG autoantibody to C1 inhibitor which inactivates it so that the presentation is strikingly similar to type I HAE. New therapies for types I and II HAE include C1 inhibitor replacement therapy, ecallantide, a kallikrein antagonist, and icatibant, a B2 receptor antagonist. A newly described type III HAE has normal C1 inhibitor, although it is thought to be mediated by bradykinin, as is an antihistamine-resistant subpopulation of\n[A import\u00e2ncia de reconhecer a s\u00edndrome antifosfol\u00edpide na medicina vascular](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=5915862)\nFunke, Andreas; Danowski, Adriana; de Andrade, Danieli Castro Oliveira; R\u00eago, Jozelia; Levy, Roger Abramino\n2017-01-01\nResumo A s\u00edndrome antifosfolip\u00edde (SAF) \u00e9 uma doen\u00e7a autoimune sist\u00eamica caracterizada por trombose arterial ou venosa recorrente e/ou morbidade gestacional e pela presen\u00e7a dos anticorpos antifosfolip\u00eddeos, podendo apresentar outras manifesta\u00e7\u00f5es vasculares, como microangiopatia, arteriopatia cr\u00f4nica e SAF catastr\u00f3fica.

Most of the cases reported in literature are related to dental, sinus, tonsillar and salivary glands causes, but rarely as consequence of skin infection. We report a unique case of lower lip cellulitis, which was initially misdiagnosed as angioedema and subsequently progressed into lower lip necrotizing fasciitis. This is a case report of necrotizing fasciitis involving the lower lip as a consequence of infected skin acne in a 19 year old black female. The patient had been diagnosed earlier as a case of angioedema by a physician and treated accordingly. She was mildly anemic, hyponatremic and hypokalemic. Treatment was started immediately by incision, drainage and full debridement of the whole necrotic tissue. Triple antibiotic therapy was administered and daily irrigation and dressing were performed until full recovery. Complete healing occurred within a month by secondary intention. This case demonstrates the misdiagnosis of a lip swelling leading to the development of labiofacial necrotizing fasciitis, a serious and life threatening condition. Lip angioedema is a common condition; however, lip fasciitis is rare. A broad differential diagnosis in case of lower lip swelling is essential to avoid inappropriate treatment delay.\n[Localized unilateral periorbital edema induced by aspirin.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9396974)\nPrice, K S; Thomson, D M\n1997-11-01\nAspirin intolerance manifested as bronchospasm or urticaria/angioedema has been observed since the beginning of this century.

There is one system located in the United States On-orbit Segment (USOS) and one system in the Russian Segment. Shuttle mission STS-126 delivered the USOS Potable Water Dispenser (PWD) to ISS on ULF2; subsequent activation occurred on November 2008. The PWD is capable of supporting an ISS crew of six, but nominally supplies only half this crew size. The PWD design provides incremental quantities of hot and ambient temperature potable water to US food and beverage packages. PWD receives iodinated water from the US Water Recovery System (WRS) Fuel Cell Water Bus, which feeds from the Water Processing Assembly (WPA). The PWD removes the biocidal iodine to make the water potable prior to dispensing. A heater assembly contained within the unit supplies up to 2.0 L of hot water (65 to 93 ?C) every 30 min. During a single meal, this quantity of water supports three to four crewmembers? food rehydration and beverages. The unit design has a functional life expectancy of 10 years, with replacement of limited life items, such as filters. To date, the PWD on-orbit performance is acceptable. Since activation of the PWD, there were several differences between on-orbit functionality and expected performance of hardware design. The comparison of on-orbit functionality to performance of hardware design is discussed for the following key areas: 1) microbial contamination, 2) no-dispense and water leakage scenarios, and 3) under-dispense scenarios.\n[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons produced by electrocautery smoke and the use of personal protective equipment 1.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28301033)\nClaudio, Caroline Vieira; Ribeiro, Renata Perfeito; Martins, J\u00falia Trevisan; Marziale, Maria Helena Palucci; Solci, Maria Cristina; Dalmas, Jos\u00e9 Carlos\n2017-03-02\nanalyze the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in electrocautery smoke in operating rooms and the use of personal protective equipment by the intraoperative team when exposed to hydrocarbons. exploratory and cross-sectional field research conducted in a surgery center.

The Urticaria Activity and Impact Measure (U-AIM) is a newly developed 9-item patient-reported measure designed for use in routine clinical practice to assess CSU activity and impact over the previous 7 days. To evaluate validity, responsiveness, and clinically meaningful change of the U-AIM. Data from a 24-week open-label single-arm period of a randomized, placebo-controlled study of omalizumab were used to assess the psychometric properties of U-AIM items for itch, hives, and angioedema. 206 patients (75% female, mean age 44.6 years) were enrolled. At baseline, U-AIM results included prevalent severe itch (55%) and >12 hives (67%), angioedema (15%), and bother by itch (84%), hives (84%), and angioedema (49%). Urticaria Patient Daily Diary (UPDD) mean weekly scores were 15.4 (itch severity), 16.8 (number of hives), and 32.2 (Urticaria Activity Score [UAS7]). At baseline, Weeks 12 and 24, U-AIM itch and hives items and UAS7 proxy scores (the sum of itch severity and number of hives over 7 days) demonstrated strong correlation coefficients with their corresponding measures from the UPDD (itch severity: 0.634-0.806; hives number: 0.735-0.843; UAS7 proxy: 0.724-0.852). Changes in U-AIM scores differentiated patients by their perspective of symptom improvement.

The USOS Potable Water Dispenser (PWD) was delivered to ISS on ULF2, Shuttle Mission STS-126, and was subsequently activated in November 2008. The PWD activation on ISS is capable of supporting an ISS crew of six but nominally supplies only half the crew. The PWD is designed to provide incremental quantities of hot and ambient temperature potable water to US style food packages. PWD receives iodinated water from the US Laboratory Fuel Cell Water Bus, which is fed from the Water Processing Assembly (WPA). The PWD removes the biocidal iodine to make the water potable prior to dispensing. A heater assembly contained within the unit supplies up to 2.0 liters of hot water (65 to 93oC) every thirty minutes. This quantity supports three to four crewmembers to rehydrate their food and beverages from this location during a single meal. The unit is designed to remain functional for up to ten years with replacement of limited life items such as filters. To date, the PWD on-orbit performance has been acceptable. Since activation of the PWD, there have been several differences between on-orbit functionality and expected performance of hardware design. The comparison of on-orbit functionality to performance of hardware design is outlined for the following key areas: microbiology, PWD to food package water leakage, no-dispense scenarios, under-dispense scenarios, and crewmember feedback on actual on-orbit use.\n[System design description for portable 1,000 CFM exhauster Skids POR-007/Skid E and POR-008/Skid F](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10148579) [DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)](http://www.osti.gov/search)\nNelson, O.D.\n1998-07-25\nThe primary purpose of the two 1,000 CFM Exhauster Skids, POR-007-SKID E and POR-008-SKID F, is to provide backup to the waste tank primary ventilation systems for tanks 241-C-106 and 241-AY-102, and the AY-102 annulus in the event of a failure during the sluicing of tank 241-C-106 and subsequent transfer of sluiced waste to 241-AY-102. This redundancy is required since both of the tank ventilation systems have been declared as Safety Class systems.\n[Vaccine allergy and pseudo-allergy.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609774)\nPonvert, Claude; Scheinmann, Pierre\n2003-01-01\nAllergic and pseudo-allergic reactions to vaccines frequently involve the skin, and can be generalized systemic symptoms (urticaria/angioedema, serum sickness, flares of eczema) or localized at the sites of vaccination (persistent nodules, abcesses, granulomas). Diagnosis of Arthus-type reactions is based on clinical history and specific IgM/IgG anti-toxoid determination. For other local reactions, diagnostic value of non-immediate responses in skin tests varies with clinical symptoms and substances involved. Immediate responses in skin tests and specific IgE determination have good diagnostic and/or predictive value in anaphylaxis and immediate/accelerated urticaria/angioedema to toxoid-, pneumococcus-, and egg- and gelatin-containing vaccines. Diagnosis of reactions to dextran in BCG is based on specific IgM/IgG determination. Most non-immediate generalized reactions result from non-specific inflammation, except for gelatin-containing vaccines, but the diagnostic value of immuno-allergological tests with the vaccines and gelatin are controversial. Withholding booster injections is advised if specific IgM/IgG levels are high. If the levels are low, sequential injections of vaccines containing a single vaccinating agent are usually tolerated. However, injections of the vaccine should be performed using a \" desensitization \" procedure in patients reporting anaphylaxis and immediate/accelerated urticaria/angioedema.\n[Uso de Sustancias en Mujeres con Desventaja Social: Riesgo para el Contagio de VIH/SIDA](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3011817)\nCianelli, R.; Ferrer, L; Bernales, M.; Miner, S.; Irarr\u00e1zabal, L.; Molina, Y.\n2009-01-01\nAntecedentes La caracterizaci\u00f3n epidemiol\u00f3gica en Chile apunta a feminizaci\u00f3n, pauperizaci\u00f3n y heterosexualizaci\u00f3n de la epidemia del VIH, lo que implica un mayor riesgo para las mujeres en desventaja social.

The molecular pathogenesis of familial angioedema associated with estrogen was further explored to find possible factors affecting severity, including polymorphisms in enzymes and receptors related to bradykinin pathways. A placebo-controlled clinical trial of C1INH concentrate in hereditary angioedema patients demonstrated the safety of its use and the efficacy to reduce duration of angioedema attacks. The interaction of innate immunity and adaptive responses was further examined in several reports establishing the significant role of toll-like receptor stimulation for the development of optimal specific antibody responses. The 2009 update of the classification of primary immunodeficiencies introduced over 15 new genetic defects related to the immune response, including DOCK8 mutations responsible for the autosomal recessive form of the hyper IgE syndrome. Other reports expanded the clinical spectrum of disease and improved the characterization of conditions such as warts, hypogammaglobulinemia and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome, or the occurrence of mucormycosis and Serratia infections in chronic granulomatous disease. The frequent presentation of gastrointestinal disorders in humoral immunodeficiencies was recognized and recommendations for management were reviewed. Clinical research focused in severe combined immunodeficiency included the development and implementation of a state-wide newborn screening program for this condition, a desired goal considering the significant reduction of mortality rate when diagnosis is made early before opportunistic infections occur.

Colonizing the mucosa of the reproductive tract depends on the bacterial outer membrane porin, PorB, which is essential for ion and nutrient uptake. PorB is also targeted to host mitochondria and regulates apoptosis pathways to promote infections. How PorB traffics from the outer membrane of N. gonorrhoeae to mitochondria and whether it modulates innate immune cells, such as macrophages, remains unclear. Here, we show that N. gonorrhoeae secretes PorB via outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Purified OMVs contained primarily outer membrane proteins including oligomeric PorB. The porin was targeted to mitochondria of macrophages after exposure to purified OMVs and wild type N. gonorrhoeae. This was associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of apoptotic caspases and cell death in a time-dependent manner. Consistent with this, OMV-induced macrophage death was prevented with the pan-caspase inhibitor, Q-VD-PH. This shows that N. gonorrhoeae utilizes OMVs to target PorB to mitochondria and to induce apoptosis in macrophages, thus affecting innate immunity. PMID:29601598\n[Physical allergies and exercise. Clinical implications for those engaged in sports activities.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8341871)\nBriner, W W\n1993-06-01\nThere are several allergic responses that may occur in susceptible individuals as a result of exposure to physical stimuli. Most of these conditions are mediated by vasoactive substances and usually result in symptoms of urticaria and/or angioedema. There are 2 such conditions that may occur as a direct result from exercise. The first of these is cholinergic urticaria. Patients with cholinergic urticaria experience punctate (2 to 4mm) hives which occur reproducibly with exercise or with passive warming, such as might occur in a steam bath or hot pool. Life-threatening hypotension or angioedema usually do not occur with cholinergic urticaria. This condition usually responds well to oral hydroxyzine. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA) is a form of physical allergy that has been recognised with increasing frequency in recent years. This syndrome typically presents with generalised pruritus, a flushing sensation, a feeling of warmth and the development of conventional (10 to 15mm) urticaria in association with vigorous physical exertion only. Symptoms tend to occur variably with exposure to exercise and do not typically occur with passive warming. During symptomatic attacks, cutaneous mast cells degranulate and serum histamine levels increase. Treatment is problematic. Cessation of exercise with onset of symptoms and self-administration of epinephrine (adrenaline) are recommended. Other physical allergies that may affect exercising individuals include cold urticaria, localised heat urticaria, symptomatic dermatographism (dermographism), delayed pressure urticaria (angioedema), solar urticaria and aquagenic urticaria. Management of these conditions may include patient education, selective avoidance, antihistamines and, in some cases, induction of tolerance.\n[Optomechanical and thermal design of the Multi-Application Solar Telescope for USO](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008SPIE.7012E..35D) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html)\nDenis, Stefan; Coucke, Pierre; Gabriel, Eric; Delrez, Christophe; Venkatakrishnan, Parameshwaran\n2008-07-01\nThe Multi-Application Solar Telescope (MAST) is a 50 cm diameter class telescope to be installed on the Udaipur Solar Observatory's Island on the Lake Fatehsagar in Udaipur, India. It is dedicated to solar observation. The telescope is designed, manufactured, assembled and installed on-site by the belgian company AMOS SA for the Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO), an academic division of the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in India. Despite its limited size, the telescope is expected to be competitive with respect to worldwide large and costly projects thanks to its versatility regarding science goals and also thanks to its demanding optomechanical and thermal specification. This paper describes the optomechanical and thermal design of this telescope and presents solutions adopted by AMOS to meet the specific requirements. The optical configuration of the telescope is based on an afocal off-axis gregorian combination integrated on an Alt.-Az. mechanical mount, with a suite of flat folding mirrors to provide the required stationary collimated beam.\n[Quincke's oedema of the uvula associated with mucous retention cyst-a case report.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23119657)\nArunachalam, P S; Ramachandra, C R\n2000-04-01\nWe report a rare case of recurrent angioedema of uvula (Quincke's Oedema), causing air way obstruction.

Recently, a novel protein secretion system, the Por secretion system (PorSS), was identified in two members of the phylum, the gliding bacterium Flavobacterium johnsoniae and the nonmotile oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. The components of the PorSS are not similar in sequence to those of other well-studied bacterial secretion systems. The F. johnsoniae PorSS genes are a subset of the gliding motility genes, suggesting a role for the secretion system in motility. The F. johnsoniae PorSS is needed for assembly of the gliding motility apparatus and for secretion of a chitinase, and the P. gingivalis PorSS is involved in secretion of gingipain protease virulence factors. Comparative analysis of 37 genomes of members of the phylum Bacteroidetes revealed the widespread occurrence of gliding motility genes and PorSS genes. Genes associated with other bacterial protein secretion systems were less common. The results suggest that gliding motility is more common than previously reported. Microscopic observations confirmed that organisms previously described as nonmotile, including Croceibacter atlanticus, \u201cGramella forsetii,\u201d Paludibacter propionicigenes, Riemerella anatipestifer, and Robiginitalea biformata, exhibit gliding motility. Three genes (gldA, gldF, and gldG) that encode an apparent ATP-binding cassette transporter required for F. johnsoniae gliding were absent from two related gliding bacteria, suggesting that the transporter may not be central to gliding motility.

A topological antigenic map was developed using overlapping synthetic peptides representing the Chlamydia trachomatis PorB sequence and polyclonal immune sera. To identify which antigenic determinants were surface accessible, monospecific antisera were raised to the PorB peptides and were used in dot-blot and ELISA-based absorption studies with viable chlamydial elementary bodies (EBs). The ability of the surface-accessible antigenic determinants to direct neutralizing Ab responses was investigated using standardized in vitro neutralization assays. Four major antigenic clusters corresponding to Phe(34)-Leu(59) (B1-2 and B1-3), Asp(112) -Glu(145) (B2-3 and B2-4), Gly(179)-Ala(225) (B3-2 to B3-4), and Val(261)-Asn(305) (B4-4 to B5-2) were identified. Collectively, the EB absorption and dot-blot assays established that the immunoreactive PorB Ags were exposed on the surface of chlamydial EBs. Peptide-specific antisera raised to the surface-accessible Ags neutralized chlamydial infectivity and demonstrated cross-reactivity to synthetic peptides representing analogous C. pneumoniae PorB sequences. Furthermore, neutralization of chlamydial infectivity by C. trachomatis PorB antisera was inhibited by synthetic peptides representing the surface-exposed PorB antigenic determinants. These findings demonstrate that PorB Ags may be useful for development of chlamydial vaccines.\n[Hypersensitivity reaction to human papillomavirus vaccine due to polysorbate 80.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22605841)\nBadiu, Iuliana; Geuna, Massimo; Heffler, Enrico; Rolla, Giovanni\n2012-05-08\nA 17-year-old girl reported generalised urticaria, eyelid angioedema, rhino-conjunctivitis, dyspnoea and wheezing 1 h after third intramuscular administration of quadrivalent human papilloma virus vaccine (Gardasil).

The primary end point was the reason for consultation, and secondary end points included the AI diagnosis made and outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed all inpatient AI consultations from July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2007. These 6 years of data were combined with 14 years of data examining the reason for consult from a previous study. The data were analyzed for trends and changes over the entire 20-year period. A total of 254 AI inpatient consults were reviewed over the 6 years studied. Thirty-six percent (92/254) of inpatient consults were for evaluation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), 22% (55/254) miscellaneous reasons, 17% (43/254) urticaria/angioedema, 13% (32/254) for possible immunodeficiency, 9% (23/254) for anaphylaxis, and 3% (8/254) for asthma. AI inpatient consults show a significant decline over the recent 6-year period (p = 0.0023) despite stable total hospital admissions since 1998. Over the last 20 years, an 85% decrease (p < 0.00001) in inpatient asthma consults and increases (p < 0.05) in immunodeficiency, rash, and urticaria/angioedema evaluations have been observed. Not following AI recommendations resulted in a 16.6 odds ratio (95% CI, 5.55-49.93) that a patient's clinical status would be worse or unchanged. Inpatient AI consults have declined with associated reduction in asthma inpatient consults. Although ADRs and anaphylaxis consults have been stable, evaluations for immunodeficiency, rash, and urticaria/angioedema have increased. Following inpatient AI recommendations is associated with improved patient outcomes.\n[International Space Station USOS Potable Water Dispenser Development](http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20080013432) [NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp)\nShaw, Laura A.; Barreda, Jose L.\n2008-01-01\nThe International Space Station (ISS) Russian Segment currently provides potable water dispensing capability for crewmember food and beverage rehydration. All ISS crewmembers rehydrate Russian and U.S. style food packages from this location. A new United States On-orbit Segment (USOS) Potable Water Dispenser (PWD) is under development. This unit will provide additional potable water dispensing capability to support an onorbit crew of six. The PWD is designed to provide incremental quantities of hot and ambient temperature potable water to U.S. style food packages. It will receive iodinated water from the Fuel Cell Water Bus in the U.S. Laboratory element. The unit will provide potable-quality water, including active removal of biocidal iodine prior to dispensing. A heater assembly contained within the unit will be able to supply up to 2.0 liters of hot water (65 to 93oC) every thirty minutes. This quantity will allow three to four crewmembers to rehydrate their food and beverages from this location during a single meal. The unit is designed to remain functional for up to ten years with replacement of limited life items such as filters. It will be the size of two stacked Shuttle Middeck lockers (approximately the size of two small suitcases) and integrated into a science payload rack in the U.S. Laboratory element. Providing potable-quality water at the proper temperature for food and beverage reconstitution is critical to maintaining crew health and well-being.

This is particularly true for costly orphan drugs because access depends primarily on co-payments, reimbursement policies and prices. The objective of this article is to identify differences in the availability of orphan drugs and in patient access to them in 11 pharmaceutical markets: Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland and the US. Four rare diseases were selected for analysis: pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), Fabry disease (FD), hereditary angioedema (HAE) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Indicators for availability were defined as (i) the indications for which orphan drugs had been authorized in the treatment of these diseases; (ii) the application date; and (iii) the date upon which these drugs received market authorization in each country. Indicators of patient access were defined as (i) the outcomes of technology appraisals; (ii) the extent of coverage provided by healthcare payers; and (iii) the price of the drugs in each country. For PAH we analysed bosentan, iloprost, sildenafil, treprostinil (intravenous and inhaled) as well as sitaxentan and ambrisentan; for FD we analysed agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta; for HAE we analysed icatibant, ecallantide and two complement C1s inhibitors; for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. Most drugs included in this study had received market authorization in all countries, but the range of indications for which they had been authorized differed by country. The broadest range of indications was found in Australia, and the largest variations in indications were found for PAH drugs. Authorization process speed (the time between application and market authorization) was fastest in the US, with an average of 362 days, followed by the EU (394 days). The highest prices for the included drugs were found in Germany and the US, and the lowest in Canada, Australia and\n[Low oxygen environment facilitates embryo availability for older ovarian responders (PORs).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29667856)\nLi, Mingzhao; Li, Zhibin; Shi, Juanzi\n2018-04-18\nWe aimed to investigate the different effects of low oxygen (5% O 2 ) and atmospheric oxygen (20% O 2 ) on in vitro fertilization for older poor ovarian responders (PORs). We selected 1080 older PORs who met two criteria: (i) advanced maternal age (\u226540) and (ii) an abnormal ovarian reserve test. All the patients used the ultra-short term protocols with GnRH agonist and recombinant FSH for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). About 506 cycles were performed in the incubators with 5% O 2 and 574 cycles were performed in the incubators with 20% O 2 . No significant differences were observed in normal fertilization rates (59.68 versus 60.25%; p = .691) and cancelation rates (18.97 versus 19.34%; p = .879) between two groups. The number of available embryos (1.77 \u00b1 0.57 versus 1.52 \u00b1 0.50; p = .041) and mean number of cells on Day 3 (7.49 \u00b1 1.82 versus 7.16 \u00b1 1.70; p = .032) were significantly higher in 5% O 2 group compared to that in 20% O 2 group.

Urticaria occurs in at least 20% of the population at some point in their lives. Acute urticaria (less than 6 weeks' duration), differs from CU in its etiology, but the onset of this disease is always acute. CU may occur as spontaneous (SCU) or induced (ICU). The diagnosis is simple, although a careful evaluation is necessary for differential diagnosis. ICU's diagnosis is mainly clinical, even if provocation tests can be useful. Supplementary studies should be limited and based on the clinical suspicion. Treatment may be divided into three approaches: avoidance, elimination or treatment of the cause, and pharmacological treatment. Recently treatment has been modified with the use of second-generation antihistamines as first-line and increased doses of nonsedating H1 antihistamines, up to 4 times, as second line. Antihistamines are essential to treat CU; however, 40% of patients do not achieve good control despite increased doses and require additional treatment. The most recent evidence indicates a group of drugs to be used as third line in these cases, to improve quality of life and to limit toxicity from frequent or chronic use of systemic steroids. Only 3 drugs are recommended as third line: omalizumab, cyclosporin A or anti-leukotrienes.\n[Photos & Graphics: Urticaria (Hives) and Angioedema](https://www.aaaai.org/about-aaaai/newsroom/photo-gallery/photos-graphics-urticaria-and-angioedema)\n... the AAAAI Foundation Donate Utility navigation Espa\u00f1ol Journals Pollen Counts Annual Meeting Member Login / My Membership Search ... navigation Donate Annual meeting Browse your conditions Check pollen counts Continuing education center Find an allergist / immunologist ...\n[Photos & Graphics: Urticaria (Hives) and Angioedema](http://www.aaaai.org/about-aaaai/newsroom/photo-gallery/photos-graphics-urticaria-and-angioedema)\n...

Due to a distortion in the body image, the people who suffer from muscle dysmorphia have the self-perception of being less muscular than they currently are. With the aim of increasing their muscular development, they resort to the use of AAS. The purpose of the present study is to know the prevalence of the use of AAS in a Spanish sample affected by muscle dysmorphia. 562 male and 172 female bodybuilders and weightlifters were provided with different questionnaires in order to know, firstly, if they suffered from this disorder and, secondly, the percentage of the participants affected who use these substances. Decision trees and regression was applied to create explanatory models for muscle dysmorphia (R = 0.78 and R2 = 0.62). The results show that almost 50% of the participants, male and female, affected by this disorder use this kind of drugs.\n[Multiple active site residues are important for photochemical efficiency in the light-activated enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27285815)\nMenon, Binuraj R K; Hardman, Samantha J O; Scrutton, Nigel S; Heyes, Derren J\n2016-08-01\nProtochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) catalyzes the light-driven reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), an essential, regulatory step in chlorophyll biosynthesis. The unique requirement of the enzyme for light has provided the opportunity to investigate how light energy can be harnessed to power biological catalysis and enzyme dynamics. Excited state interactions between the Pchlide molecule and the protein are known to drive the subsequent reaction chemistry. However, the structural features of POR and active site residues that are important for photochemistry and catalysis are currently unknown, because there is no crystal structure for POR. Here, we have used static and time-resolved spectroscopic measurements of a number of active site variants to study the role of a number of residues, which are located in the proposed NADPH/Pchlide binding site based on previous homology models, in the reaction mechanism of POR. Our findings, which are interpreted in the context of a new improved structural model, have identified several residues that are predicted to interact with the coenzyme or substrate. Several of the POR variants have a profound effect on the photochemistry, suggesting that multiple residues are important in stabilizing the excited state required for catalysis. Our work offers insight into how the POR active site geometry is finely tuned by multiple active site residues to support enzyme-mediated photochemistry and reduction of Pchlide, both of which are crucial to the existence of life on Earth.

The CQ uses Node 2 cabin air for ventilation/thermal cooling, as opposed to conditioned ducted air from the ISS Temperature Humidity Control System or the ISS fluid cooling loop connections. Consequently, CQ can only increase the air flow rate to reduce the temperature delta between the cabin and the CQ interior. However, increasing airflow causes increased acoustic noise so efficient airflow distribution is an important design parameter. The CQ utilized a two fan push-pull configuration to ensure fresh air at the crewmember s head position and reduce acoustic exposure. The CQ interior needs to be below Noise Curve 40 (NC-40). The CQ ventilation ducts are open to the significantly louder Node 2 cabin aisle way which required significantly acoustic mitigation controls. The design implementation of the CQ ventilation system and acoustic mitigation are very inter-related and require consideration of crew comfort balanced with use of interior habitable volume, accommodation of fan failures, and possible crew uses that impact ventilation and acoustic performance. This paper illustrates the types of model analysis, assumptions, vehicle interactions, and trade-offs required for CQ ventilation and acoustics. Additionally, on-orbit ventilation system performance and initial crew feedback is presented. This approach is applicable to any private enclosed space that the crew will occupy.\n[Nursing care missed in patients at risk of or having pressure ulcers.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27878218)\nValles, Jonathan Hermayn Hern\u00e1ndez; Monsiv\u00e1is, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Moreno; Guzm\u00e1n, Ma Guadalupe Interial; Arreola, Leticia V\u00e1zquez\n2016-11-21\no uso de redutor de press\u00e3o em proemin\u00eancias \u00f3sseas e tubos de drenagem que interferem nos movimentos do paciente (ambos com 58,6%) e uso de colch\u00f5es pneum\u00e1ticos (57,6%). foi encontrada alta porcentagem de cuidado de enfermagem omitido na percep\u00e7\u00e3o da equipe.

Mutants of ARF6 defective in GTP binding and hydrolysis have a marked effect on endocytic trafficking and the gross morphology of the peripheral membrane system. Here we report that expression of the GTPase-defective mutant of ARF6, ARF6(Q67L), remodels the actin cytoskeleton by inducing actin polymerization at the cell periphery. This cytoskeletal rearrangement was inhibited by co-expression of ARF6(Q67L) with deletion mutants of POR1, a Rac1-interacting protein involved in membrane ruffling, but not with the dominant-negative mutant of Rac1, Rac1(S17N). A synergistic effect between POR1 and ARF6 for the induction of actin polymerization was detected. Furthermore, we observed that ARF6 interacts directly with POR1 and that this interaction was GTP dependent. These findings indicate that ARF6 and Rac1 function on distinct signaling pathways to mediate cytoskeletal reorganization, and suggest a role for POR1 as an important regulatory element in orchestrating cytoskeletal rearrangements at the cell periphery induced by ARF6 and Rac1.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand how the mask quality and patterning performance can change during mask fabrication, EUV exposure, maintenance cleaning, shipping, or storage. The fact that a pellicle is not used to protect the mask surface in EUV lithography suggests that EUV masks may have to undergo more cleaning cycles during their lifetime. More frequent cleaning, combined with the adoption of new materials for EUV masks, necessitates that mask manufacturers closely examine the performance change of EUV masks during cleaning process. We have investigated EUV mask quality and patterning performance during 30 cycles of Samsung's EUV mask SPM-based cleaning and 20 cycles of SEMATECH ADT exposure. We have observed that the quality and patterning performance of EUV masks does not significantly change during these processes except mask pattern CD change. To resolve this issue, we have developed an acid-free cleaning POR and substantially improved EUV mask film loss compared to the SPM-based cleaning POR.\n[Detecci\u00f3n y estudio mediante Fluorescencia Inducida por L\u00e1ser de radicales libres formados por Disociaci\u00f3n Multifot\u00f3nica Infrarroja](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003cnam.conf...90S) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html)\nSantos, M.; D\u00edaz, L.; Torresano, J.

La disociaci\u00f3n de mol\u00e9culas poliat\u00f3micas en el IR con l\u00e1seres de CO2 tiene lugar desde la superficie de energ\u00eda molecular mas baja y conduce generalmente a la formaci\u00f3n de fragmentos en el estado electr\u00f3nico fundamental, con diversos grados de excitaci\u00f3n vibracional. En el Grupo de Procesos Multifot\u00f3nicos del Instituto de Estructura de la Materia del C.S.I.C. hemos puesto a punto la t\u00e9cnica de Fluorescencia Inducida por L\u00e1ser (LIF) para la detecci\u00f3n y an\u00e1lisis en tiempo real de los fragmentos producidos en la DMI inducida mediante uno o dos campos l\u00e1seres de diferentes longitudes de onda. Objetivos de nuestro trabajo han sido el estudio de los canales de disociaci\u00f3n mayoritarios y de las especies transitoria producidas, as\u00ed como de la distribuci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda interna con que \u00e9stas son generadas. En particular hemos detectado mediante LIF las especies: C2, CF, CH, SiH2, CF2, CH2, SiHCl, y CF3 a partir de la disociaci\u00f3n de, entre otras, las siguientes mol\u00e9culas: C2H3Br, C3F6, C4H8Si, C2H5ClSi y CH5ClSi. En este trabajo presentamos algunos de los resultados obtenidos mediante el estudio por LIF de estos radicales: estudio temporal de la se\u00f1al LIF obtenida con determinaci\u00f3n de tiempos de vida, espectros de excitaci\u00f3n y fluorescencia, temperaturas vibracionales de formaci\u00f3n, variaci\u00f3n de la intensidad LIF con el tiempo de retraso entre los l\u00e1seres de disociaci\u00f3n y prueba, etc.\n[Determinacion del error sistematico del momentum de muones producidos por interacciones neutrino-nucleon en el detector MINER$$\\](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1362136) [DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)](http://www.osti.gov/search)\nDiaz Bautista, Gonzalo A.\nEl Modelo Estandar describe todas las partculas observadas en el naturaleza hasta el momento as como las caractersticas que gobiernan a las interacciones fundamentales entre ellas. En especial es posible identicar a las interacciones electromagnetica y debil, las cuales bajo determinadas condiciones de temperatura y energa pueden ser descritas a traves de una sola teora que engloba a ambas. A esta teora se le denomina electrodebil y tiene como nalidad caracterizar las propiedades de la interaccion maniesta a partir de la mezcla de las interacciones electromagnetica y debil, la que tambien lleva como nombre interaccion electrodebil. Particularmente, los neutrinos sonmore \u00bb de especial interes ya que, por un lado, interactuan por medio de la interaccion debil muy raramente en comparacion con otras partculas y, por el otro, no son acertadamente descritos por el Modelo Estandar. Por medio de observaciones experimentales que demostraban que los neutrinos cambian de sabor al propagarse, fenomeno llamado oscilaciones de neutrinos, se pudo llegar a la conclusion de que la implicancia de este fenomeno da como consecuencia que los neutrinos efectivamente s tienen masa, algo que entra en contradiccion con la descripcion inicial del Modelo Estandar, el cual los describe como partculas sin masa. Es de esta manera que las oscilaciones de neutrinos han sido y siguen siendo en la actualidad objeto de interes en la Fsica de Altas Energas tanto teorica como experimental. A n de poder realizar mediciones precisas de oscilaciones de neutrinos, los experimentos encargados de estas mediciones deben tratar de reducir sus incertidumbres en lo posible. Una de estas proviene de la caracterizacion de las secciones de choque de los neutrinos cuando interactuan con la materia, particularmente los nucleones al interior de los nucleos atomicos. El experimento MINERA esta orientado, entre otras cosas, a hacer una correcta caracterizacion de secciones de choque neutrino-nucleon por medio del\n[Resistencia a antibi\u00f3ticos de \u00faltima l\u00ednea en cocos Gram positivos: la era posterior a la vancomicina](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4435674)\nRinc\u00f3n, Sandra; Panesso, Diana; D\u00edaz, Lorena; Carvajal, Lina P.; Reyes, Jinnethe; Munita, Jos\u00e9 M.; Arias, C\u00e9sar A.\n2015-01-01\nEn los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se han desarrollado nuevas alternativas para el tratamiento de infecciones por pat\u00f3genos Gram positivos multirresistentes, entre los cuales Staphylococcus aureus resistente a la meticilina (SARM) y los enterococos resistentes a la vancomicina (ERV) se consideran un verdadero reto terap\u00e9utico, y aunque el uso de la vancomicina en infecciones graves causadas por SARM ha generado serias dudas en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, contin\u00faa siendo escasa la informaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica de respaldo al uso de agentes terap\u00e9uticos que la superen en eficacia.

A.\n2012-01-01\nNeisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are major bacterial agents of meningitis. They each bind the 37/67-kDa laminin receptor (LamR) via the surface protein adhesins: meningococcal PilQ and PorA, H. influenzae OmpP2 and pneumococcal CbpA. We have previously reported that a surface-exposed loop of the R2 domain of CbpA mediates LamR-binding. Here we have identified the LamR-binding regions of PorA and OmpP2. Using truncated recombinant proteins we show that binding is dependent on amino acids 171\u2013240 and 91\u201399 of PorA and OmpP2, respectively, which are predicted to localize to the fourth and second surface-exposed loops, respectively, of these proteins. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the loops bound LamR and could block LamR-binding to bacterial ligands in a dose dependant manner. Meningococci expressing PorA lacking the apex of loop 4 and H. influenzae expressing OmpP2 lacking the apex of loop 2 showed significantly reduced LamR binding. Since both loops are hyper-variable, our data may suggest a molecular basis for the range of LamR-binding capabilities previously reported among different meningococcal and H. influenzae strains.

It is usually performed with the prick and the prick-to-prick method. The aim of this study is to report the first two pediatric cases of systemic allergic reactions during skin prick tests (SPT) with commercial food allergens. Both patients had a history of fish allergy. A 5-year-old girl, with a history of atopic dermatitis and asthma, reported an episode of urticaria and angioedema due to ingestion of fish, which had occurred 2 years before consultation. Ten minutes after having completed SPT to fish extracts, which had resulted positive, she suffered from generalized pruritus, nausea, stomach pain, and loss of consciousness. A 9-year-old boy, with a history of asthma and two episodes of acute urticaria and angioedema upon eating fish during infancy, reported a recent episode of oropharyngeal pruritus after tasting salmon. He was evaluated for fish allergy with SPT but developed conjunctivitis and acute urticaria during the first 10 min of the test. Anaphylaxis appears to be a rare side effect of skin testing in pediatric patients. Children with a history of asthma and atopic dermatitis are more likely to react.\n[Sabemos prescrever profilaxia de tromboembolismo venoso nos pacientes internados?](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=5868935)\nLopes, Bruno Abdala Candido; Teixeira, Isabela Pizzatto; de Souza, Taynara Dantas; Tafarel, Jean Rodrigo\n2017-01-01\nResumo Contexto Embora preconizada, a profilaxia de tromboembolismo venoso (TEV) deixa de ser realizada sistematicamente em pacientes internados.

Current restrictions on the United States Orbital Segment (USOS) Solar Array (SA) positioning during Russian Vehicle (RV) departure from ISS nadir and zenith ports cause SA to be positioned in the plume field of Service Module thrusters and lead to degradation of SAs as well as potential damage to Sun tracking Beta Gimbal Assemblies (BGA). These restrictions are imposed because of the single fault tolerant RV Motion Control System (MCS), which does not meet ISS Safety requirements for catastrophic hazards and dictates 16 degree Solar Array Rotary Joint position, which ensures that ISS and RV relative motion post separation, does lead to collision. The purpose of this paper is to describe a methodology and the analysis that was performed to determine relative motion trajectories of the ISS and separating RV for nominal and contingency cases. Analysis was performed in three phases that included ISS free drift prior to Visiting Vehicle separation, ISS and Visiting Vehicle relative motion analysis and clearance analysis. First, the ISS free drift analysis determined the worst case attitude and attitude rate excursions prior to RV separation based on a series of different configurations and mass properties. Next, the relative motion analysis calculated the separation trajectories while varying the initial conditions, such as docking mechanism performance, Visiting Vehicle MCS failure, departure port location, ISS attitude and attitude rates at the time of separation, etc. The analysis employed both orbital mechanics and rigid body rotation calculations while accounting for various atmospheric conditions and gravity gradient effects. The resulting relative motion trajectories were then used to determine the worst case separation envelopes during\n[Binge drinking: a pattern associated with a risk of problems of alcohol use among university students.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28902931)\nBedendo, Andr\u00e9; Andrade, Andr\u00e9 Luiz Monezi; Opaleye, Em\u00e9rita S\u00e1tiro; Noto, Ana Regina\n2017-09-12\nto evaluate problems associated with alcohol use among university students who reported binge drinking in comparison to students who consumed alcohol without binging. a cross-sectional study among university students (N=2,408) who accessed the website about alcohol use.

Real-world health care data among children with CIU/CSU remain scarce. To describe treatment patterns, health care resource utilization (HRU), and costs in pediatric patients with CIU/CSU (<12 years old) and to compare these with pediatric patients without CIU/CSU. A commercial administrative claims data base (September 2013 to June 2016) was used. The CIU/CSU cohort included pediatric patients with either two or more claims for a diagnosis of urticaria \u22656 weeks apart or one or more claims for a diagnosis of urticaria and one or more claims for a diagnosis of angioedema \u22656 weeks apart (index was defined as the first claim). The control cohort comprised pediatric patients without urticaria or angioedema (index randomly assigned). Patients with <6 months of eligibility before and after the index date were excluded. HRU and costs were compared between the cohorts during the observation period after propensity score matching. A total of 6109 pediatric patients with CIU/CSU were selected, and 6107 were 1:1 matched with controls. The patients with CIU/CSU who had a mean \u00b1 standard deviation age of 4.58 \u00b1 3.36 years, and 47.9% were girls. CIU/CSU-related medication use increased after diagnosis (e.g., baseline versus 6-month follow-up, 2.2 versus 8.0% for nonsedating prescription H1 antihistamines; 7.4 versus 17.4% for oral corticosteroids). Relative to the controls, the patients with CIU/CSU had higher rates of HRU (incidence rate ratios of 1.71, 2.39, and 2.07 for inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient visits, respectively; all p < 0.01), and higher all-cause per patient per year costs (mean cost differences of $2090, $1606, and $483 for total, medical, and pharmacy costs, respectively; all p < 0.01).

Items were developed through a multistage process involving a comprehensive literature review, focus-groups, qualitative data collection, and survey of online racism experiences. Based on a sample of 1,023 racial minority participants, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses provided support for a 30-item bifactor model accounted by the general factor and the following 3 specific factors: (a) personal experience of racial cyber-aggression, (b) vicarious exposure to racial cyber-aggression, and (c) online-mediated exposure to racist reality. The PORS demonstrated measurement invariance across racial/ethnic groups in our sample. Internal reliability estimates for the total and subscale scores of the PORS were above .88 and the 4-week test-retest reliability was adequate.

Prof. Por attended the Faculty of Medicine in Budapest from 1918 to 1920, and Prof. Klopstock studied at the same place between 1917 and 1919. From 1920 until graduation on 6th February 1926, Prof. Por continued his studies at the German Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague. Prof. Klopstock had to interrupt his studies in Budapest due to pulmonary tuberculosis; he received treatment at Tatranske Matliare where he befriended Franz Kafka. Later, upon Kafka's encouragement, he changed institutions and continued his studies at the German Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, where he graduated the first great go. It is very likely that, during their studies in Budapest and Prague, both professors met repeatedly, even though their life paths later separated. Following his graduation, Prof. Por practiced as an internist in Prague, later in Slovakia, and from 1945 in Kosice. In 1961, he was awarded the title of university professor of internal medicine at the Faculty of Medicine, Pavol Jozef Safarik University in Kosice, where he practiced until his death in 1980. Prof. Klopstock continued his studies in Kiel and Berlin. After his graduation in 1933, he practiced in Berlin as a surgeon and in 1938 left for USA. In 1962, he was awarded the title of university professor of pulmonary surgery in NewYork, where he died in 1972.\n[TECNOLOG\u00cdAS DE INFORMACI\u00d3N Y COMUNICACI\u00d3N PARA LA PREVENCI\u00d3N Y CONTROL DE LA INFECCI\u00d3N POR EL VIH Y OTRAS ITS*](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4556424)\nCurioso, Walter H.; Blas, Magaly M.; Kurth, Ann E.; Klausner, Jeffrey D.\n2010-01-01\nAvances tecnol\u00f3gicos innovadores como Internet, computadoras personales de bolsillo, tel\u00e9fonos celulares y otros equipos son un arsenal en crecimiento en el esfuerzo de impedir y controlar el VIH y otras infecciones de transmisi\u00f3n sexual (ITS).

The prevalence of mastocytosis in patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy is high, and thus the disease should be suspected in patients with severe reactions caused by Hymenoptera stings and increased serum basal tryptase (SBT) levels. We sought to evaluate the presence of clonal MC disorders in patients seen at our mastocytosis center with Hymenoptera sting-induced anaphylaxis, documented hypotension, absence of urticaria pigmentosa, and normal SBT levels. Twenty-two patients with Hymenoptera sting-induced anaphylaxis, without skin lesions, and with tryptase levels of less than 11.4 ng/mL underwent bone marrow evaluation. Bone mineral density was assessed in those patients with ascertained mastocytosis. In 16 of 22 patients, a diagnosis of indolent mastocytosis could be established, and 1 patient had a monoclonal MC activation syndrome. Patients with mastocytosis had higher SBT levels (P = .03) but only rarely had angioedema/urticaria associated with hypotension (P = .004). The absence of urticaria or angioedema in severe reactions to Hymenoptera stings with hypotension might represent the most relevant factor in identifying patients with mastocytosis, regardless of their serum tryptase levels.

In dermatology, the correlation between intestinal microbial agents and cutaneous lesions is well established. Giardia duodenalis, an intestinal parasite, has been particularly widely studied. The aim of this work is to provide a review of studies demonstrating the involvement of G. duodenalis in various forms of dermatosis. The data were obtained by an English-language literature search of Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar for the period 1975-2015. Among the thirty case reports since 1976, we selected the twenty most objective and clinically relevant. This review demonstrates that intestinal giardiasis may be an etiological factor, either alone or in combination with other agents, of various dermatoses through inflammatory and allergic mechanisms or intestinal hyperpermeability. The mucocutaneous lesions are varied: urticaria, angioedema, atopic dermatitis, erythema nodosum, Wells syndrome, among others. The role and origin of the infection are often unknown, and it is thus difficult to determine the interval between parasite infestation and the onset of skin lesions. Consequently, a fecal examination to identify G. duodenalis should be considered in chronic urticaria or angioedema, and where atopic dermatitis occurs in adulthood without any specific etiology. Therapeutic test should be done in every suspicion. Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Xavier\n2016-01-01\nPorphyromonas gingivalis is a member of the human oral microbiome abundant in dysbiosis and implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal (gum) disease. It employs a newly described type-IX secretion system (T9SS) for secretion of virulence factors. Cargo proteins destined for secretion through T9SS carry a recognition signal in the conserved C-terminal domain (CTD), which is removed by sortase PorU during translocation. Here, we identified a novel component of T9SS, PorZ, which is essential for surface exposure of PorU and posttranslational modification of T9SS cargo proteins. These include maturation of enzyme precursors, CTD removal and attachment of anionic lipopolysaccharide for anchorage in the outer membrane. The crystal structure of PorZ revealed two \u03b2-propeller domains and a C-terminal \u03b2-sandwich domain, which conforms to the canonical CTD architecture. We further documented that PorZ is itself transported to the cell surface via T9SS as a full-length protein with its CTD intact, independently of the presence or activity of PorU. Taken together, our results shed light on the architecture and possible function of a novel component of the T9SS. Knowledge of how T9SS operates will contribute to our understanding of protein secretion as part of host-microbiome interactions by dysbiotic members of the human oral cavity.

Current vaccines suffer from variable immune-protective effects, so more effective ones are needed to control Salmonella infection : Bacterial ghosts have been produced by the expression of lysis gene E from bacteriophage PhiX174 and can be filled with considerable exogenous substances such as DNA or drugs as a novel platform. In this study, Salmonella enteritidis (SE) ghosts were developed and loaded with Neisseria gonorrhoeae porin B (porB) to construct a novel inactive vaccine. Our new studies show that SE ghosts loaded with porB displayed increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12p70) in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), and elicited significantly higher specific systemic and mucosal immune responses to Salmonella than SE ghosts alone. In addition, the novel porB-loaded ghosts conferred higher protective effects on virulent Salmonella challenge. For the first time, we demonstrate that N. gonorrhoeae porB, as a novel adjuvant, can increase the immunogenicity of SE ghosts. Our studies suggested that Salmonella enteritidis ghosts loaded with Neisseria gonorrhoeae porin B might be a useful mucosal Salmonella vaccine candidate for practical use in the future. \u00a9 FEMS 2016.

This observational and cross-sectional study assessed, in February and March 2015, 69 districts (nine of 11 provinces of Mozambique) that have benefited from the mass distribution of mosquito nets. The Lot Quality Assurance Sampling methodology was used. Each locality was denominated supervision area. The Lot Quality Assurance Sampling opts for a minimum of 19 households (in this case, we decided for a minimum of 100 households per district) from each supervision area to assess an indicator (in this case, two indicators were assessed: ownership and use of mosquito nets). Two questions guided the research: a) received a mosquito net; b) used a mosquito net the night before. A total of 6,725 households were assessed. Eighty three percent of them had received mosquito nets in the campaign. Of the 6,232 respondents, 82.0% said they used mosquito nets the night before. The districts of the provinces with low coverage of ownership and use were Tete (69.5% and 60.0%, respectively), Zambezia (79.0% and 60.0%, respectively), and Gaza (81.6% and 70.7%, respectively). The largest coverage of ownership and use were observed in the districts of Nampula (96.7% and 93.8%, respectively) and Niassa (86.0% and 85.4% respectively). In the districts assessed, the progression of ownership and use of mosquito nets is satisfactory. Nampula and Niassa are the only provinces where ownership and use are at desired levels.

Cutaneous reactions, such as acute urticaria and angioedema, are among the most common manifestations of food allergy. However, cutaneous manifestations of food allergy encompass more than just IgE-mediated processes and include atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and even dermatitis herpetiformis. These cutaneous manifestations provide an opportunity to better understand the diversity of adverse immunologic responses to food and the interconnected pathways that produce them.

Helminth infections in human host cause an immune response associated with elevated levels of IgE, tissue eosinophilia and mastocytosis, and with the presence of CD4+ T cells that preferentially produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Individuals exposed to helminth infections may have allergic inflammatory responses to parasites and parasite antigens. PubMed search of human cases of allergic reactions occurring during T. solium infestation was performed combining the terms (allergy, urticaria, angioedema, asthma, anaphylaxis) with T. solium . A study was considered eligible for inclusion in the review if it reported data on patients with T. solium infestation who had signs or symptoms of allergy. In literature we found six articles reporting the association between an allergic reaction and T. solium infestation: two cases of urticaria, two cases of relapsing angioedema, one case of asthma and two cases of anaphylaxis. Despite the large diffusion of T. solium infestation, we found only a few cases of concomitant allergic reaction and the presence of Taenia in the host. The association between T. solium infestation and allergic manifestations has never been clearly demonstrated, and in absence of a well-documented causality the hypotheses are merely speculative. Therefore, the association between Taenia infection and allergy needs to be thoroughly studied to better clarify if this association may really exist and which is the pathogenetic mechanism supported.\n[[Allergic and non-allergic hypersensitivity to non-opioid analgesics, antipyretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in children: epidemiology, clinical aspects, pathophysiology, diagnosis and prevention].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22381666)\nPonvert, C\n2012-05-01\nNon-opioid analgesics, antipyretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used, but suspected allergic reactions to these drugs are rare, especially in children. Most frequent reactions are cutaneous (urticaria, angioedema) and respiratory (rhinitis, asthma). Other reactions (anaphylaxis, potentially harmful toxidermias) are rare. In a few patients, reactions may result from a specific (allergic) hypersensitivity, with positive responses in prick and intradermal tests (anaphylaxis, immediate urticaria and/or angioedema) and in intradermal and patch tests (non-immediate reactions). However, most reactions result from a non-specific (non-allergic) hypersensitivity (intolerance), with a frequent cross-reactivity between the various families of analgesics, antipyretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including paracetamol. Based on a convincing clinical history and/or positive responses in challenge tests, intolerance to non-opioid analgesics, antipyretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been diagnosed in 13 to 50% of the patients with allergic-like reactions to these drugs. Risk factors are a personal atopy and age. Prevention is based on administration of other (families of) analgesics, antipyretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with allergic hypersensitivity to these drugs. In patients with non-allergic hypersensitivity, prevention is based on administration of drugs with a low cyclo-oxygenase-1 inhibitory activity (if tolerated). Desensitization is efficient in patients with respiratory reactions, but does not work in patients with mucocutaneous reactions and anaphylaxis. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It has been shown to (1) up-regulate the surface expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 and of MHC class II (which are TLR2/MyD88 dependent and related to the porin's immune-potentiating ability), (2) be involved in prevention of apoptosis by modulating the mitochondrial membrane potential, and (3) form pores in eukaryotic cells. As an outer membrane protein, its native trimeric form isolation is complicated by its insoluble nature, requiring the presence of detergent throughout the whole procedure, and by its tight association with other outer membrane components, such as neisserial LOS or lipoproteins. In this study, an improved chromatographic purification method to obtain an homogeneous product free of endotoxin and lipoprotein is described, without loss of any of the above-mentioned properties of the porin. Furthermore, we have investigated the requirement of the native trimeric structure for the porin's activity. Inactivation of functional PorB trimers into non-functional monomers was achieved by incubation on ice. Thus, routine long- and medium-term storage at low temperature may be a cause of porin inactivation.\n[A score for the differential diagnosis of bradykinin- and histamine-induced head and neck swellings.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29721614)\nLenschow, M; Bas, M; Johnson, F; Wirth, M; Strassen, U\n2018-05-02\nAcute edema of the head and neck region may lead to life-threatening dyspnea and require quick and targeted treatment. They can be subdivided in bradykinin- and histamine-mediated swellings, which require treatment with different classes of pharmaceuticals. Clinical pathways for differential diagnoses do not exist so far, although it is known that early treatment is decisive for faster symptom relief and reduced expression of the swellings. Aim of the study was the creation of a clinical algorithm for identification of bradykinin-mediated angioedema. 188 patients that presented to our outpatient department between 2010 and 2016 with an acute, non-inflammatory swelling of the head and neck region were included in our retrospective study. All available anamnestic and clinical parameters were obtained from patient files. Parameters showing significant differences between the two groups were included in our score. Utilization of the Youden's index allowed determination of an optimal cut-off value. 76 patients could be assigned to the histamine and 112 patients to bradykinin group. The following parameters were included in our score: age, dyspnea, itching or erythema, glucocorticoid response and intake of ACEi/AT-II blockers. The cut-off value is set at three points. The proposed score yielded a sensitivity for identification of bradykinin-mediated angioedema of 96%, a specificity of 84%, a positive predictive value of 91% and a negative predictive value of 93%. Utilization of the proposed score allows quick and reliable assignment of patients to the correct subgroup and thereby reduces time for treatment.\n[Safety of aspirin desensitization in patients with reported aspirin allergy and cardiovascular disease.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22990948)\nMcMullan, Kathryn L; Wedner, H James\n2013-01-01\nAspirin (ASA) is the drug of choice in patients with coronary artery disease for primary and secondary prevention. This poses a problem for those patients reporting hypersensitivity to this drug or class of drugs. Desensitization to ASA may be carried out safely and effectively in patients with reported ASA or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) hypersensitivity needing ASA for cardiac indications. Our 7-step protocol is one choice for a rapid desensitization protocol. A retrospective chart review was conducted evaluating ASA desensitization in patients with reported ASA or NSAID hypersensitivity and a cardiac indication for ASA. In 160 evaluations over 15 years, 89 desensitizations were performed in both the inpatient and outpatient setting with only 16 reactions (18%). Eleven of these 16 patients (68.7%) were able to take daily ASA. Twenty-six desensitization procedures were performed with our 7-step rapid desensitization protocol in 10 inpatients and 16 outpatients with 3 reactions (18.75% of reactions). Initial reaction to ASA involving angioedema and reacting to ASA within the past year increased the risk of having a reaction to desensitization. Desensitization may be safely performed in patients with reported ASA or NSAID hypersensitivity and a cardiac indication for ASA. Our 7-step rapid protocol may be used in both the inpatient and outpatient setting to desensitize these patients. Patients who had angioedema with ASA ingestion or a reaction to ASA within the past year are at higher risk for reaction during the desensitization protocol. The authors have no funding, financial relationships, or conflicts of interest to disclose. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n[Adjuvant Effects Elicited by Novel Oligosaccharide Variants of Detoxified Meningococcal Lipopolysaccharides on Neisseria meningitidis Recombinant PorA Protein: A Comparison in Mice](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4278719)\nMehta, Ojas H.; Norheim, Gunnstein; Hoe, J .

Richard\n2014-01-01\nNeisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has adjuvant properties that can be exploited to assist vaccine immunogenicity. The modified penta-acylated LPS retains the adjuvant properties of hexa-acylated LPS but has a reduced toxicity profile. In this study we investigated whether two modified glycoform structures (LgtE and IcsB) of detoxified penta-acylated LPS exhibited differential adjuvant properties when formulated as native outer membrane vesicles (nOMVs) as compared to the previously described LgtB variant. Detoxified penta-acylated LPS was obtained by disruption of the lpxL1 gene (LpxL1 LPS), and three different glycoforms were obtained by disruption of the lgtB, lgtE or icsB genes respectively. Mice (mus musculus) were immunized with a recombinant PorA P1.7-2,4 (rPorA) protein co-administered with different nOMVs (containing a different PorA serosubtype P1.7,16), each of which expressed one of the three penta-acylated LPS glycoforms. All nOMVs induced IgG responses against the rPorA, but the nOMVs containing the penta-acylated LgtB-LpxL1 LPS glycoform induced significantly greater bactericidal activity compared to the other nOMVs or when the adjuvant was Alhydrogel. Compared to LgtE or IcsB LPS glycoforms, these data support the use of nOMVs containing detoxified, modified LgtB-LpxL1 LPS as a potential adjuvant for future meningococcal protein vaccines.

The prevalence of PAR ranges from 0.1% to 75% according to various studies. The pathogenetic mechanism of these diseases is not immunologically mediated. Food, additives, and drugs are the main responsibilities for PAR. The diagnosis of PAR is characterized by the absence of specific IgE for the suspected products. The absence of immunological mechanisms is confirmed by in vitro and in vivo tests. The treatment of PAR is similar to that of allergic diseases (antihistamine drugs, steroids, B2 agonists, epinephrine).\n['Mass allergy': acute scombroid poisoning in a deployed Australian Defence Force health facility.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21284820)\nWard, David Ian\n2011-02-01\nOn the last night of disaster relief operations in Sumatra, Indonesia, a mass casualty event occurred that involved deployed Australian Defence Force personnel.

The reported incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to liposomal amphotericin-B (AmBisome), especially during therapy, is very rare. We report two patients with kala-azar: one developed breathing difficulties and hypotension followed by shock and the other had facial angioedema with chest tightness during treatment. Both patients were managed with immediate action of injection: adrenaline, diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone. In our experience, AmBisome can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions that warrant proper support and close supervision.

This is a cross-sectional study with probabilistic conglomerate sampling, involving 1,154 students, aged 13 to 19 years old, from the public school system, in the city of Olinda, State of Pernambuco, Brazil, carried out in 2014. We used the Youth Risk Behavior Survey questionnaire, validated for use with Brazilian adolescents. The Chi-square test (\u2264 0.05) and Poisson regression analysis were used to estimate the prevalence ratios, with 95% confidence intervals. Use in life of illicit drugs was four times more prevalent among students who reported binge drinking (95%CI 3.19-5.45). Being in the age group of 16 to 19 years, being male, and having no religion were also significantly associated with illicit drug use. The prevalence of use in life of illicit drugs was higher in this study than in other studies carried out in Brazil and it was strongly associated with binge drinking. This factor was associated with gender, age, and religion.

Data about NBL antibiotic hypersensitivity in children are limited. The aim of this study is to evaluate characteristic reactions to NBL antibiotics in children. Patients with suspected NBL allergy were assessed between 2011 and 2015. Characteristics of the reactions and results of skin and drug provocation tests (DPTs) were recorded. In total, 96 patients aged 75.15 \u00b1 56.77 months (range: 3-208) were assessed. Clarithromycin (63.6%) was the most common cause of reactions reported. After ingestion of NBL antibiotics, maculopapular rash, urticaria/angioedema and anaphylaxis presented in 48.9, 40.7 and 10.4% of the patients, respectively. Tests were performed in 85 patients. Intradermal tests were positive in 3 patients (clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole) and DPT was positive in 1 patient (clarithromycin). Eleven patients could not be tested. Seven patients had severe anaphylaxis, and 4 patients with urticaria/angioedema had to take their medications at the time of the reaction so desensitization was performed. When only patients confirmed by tests were evaluated, NBL allergy was 4.7% (4/85) in our study group. However, when patients who could not be tested, but were regarded as suffering from drug hypersensitivity according to clinical findings, were included, the frequency of NBL allergy was 15.6% (15/96). Most of the children with suspected NBL do not have true hypersensitivity. The frequency of confirmed hypersensitivity is low, and thus a detailed history should be taken from patients with suspected NBL hypersensitivity and DPTs should be performed in patients without contraindications. \u00a9 2016 S.

We built a modular program that semi-automatically performs cohort identification, confounding adjustment, diagnostic checks, aggregation and effect estimation across multiple databases, and application of a sequential alerting algorithm. During beta-testing, we applied the system to five databases to evaluate nine examples emulating prospective monitoring with retrospective data (five pairs for which we expected signals, two negative controls, and two examples for which it was uncertain whether a signal would be expected): cerivastatin versus atorvastatin and rhabdomyolysis; paroxetine versus tricyclic antidepressants and gastrointestinal bleed; lisinopril versus angiotensin receptor blockers and angioedema; ciprofloxacin versus macrolide antibiotics and Achilles tendon rupture; rofecoxib versus non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ns-NSAIDs) and myocardial infarction; telithromycin versus azithromycin and hepatotoxicity; rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin and diabetes and rhabdomyolysis; and celecoxib versus ns-NSAIDs and myocardial infarction. We describe the program, the necessary inputs, and the assumed data environment. In beta-testing, the system generated four alerts, all among positive control examples (i.e., lisinopril and angioedema; rofecoxib and myocardial infarction; ciprofloxacin and tendon rupture; and cerivastatin and rhabdomyolysis). Sequential effect estimates for each example were consistent in direction and magnitude with existing literature. Beta-testing across nine drug-outcome examples demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed semi-automated prospective monitoring approach. In retrospective assessments, the system identified an increased risk of myocardial infarction with rofecoxib and an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis with cerivastatin years\nAmar, Sheila M; Dreskin, Stephen C\n2008-03-01\nUrticaria with or without angioedema is frequently encountered in primary care medicine. Although many patients and physicians think that urticaria is evidence of an IgE-mediated allergic reaction, often the etiology of urticaria is unknown. This uncertainty frequently results in patients enduring unnecessary lifestyle changes or extensive testing. In more persistent cases, patients achieve control of their disease only with the use of more toxic medications, such as corticosteroids, and this can lead to a range of systemic complications. Acute urticaria is typically due to a hypersensitivity reaction while chronic urticaria has a more complex pathogenesis. Antihistamines remain the mainstay of symptomatic treatment for both.\n[Study of the interaction mechanisms between absorbed NO{sub 2} and por-Si/SnO{sub x} nanocomposite layers](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22210488-study-interaction-mechanisms-between-absorbed-sub-por-si-sno-sub-nanocomposite-layers) [DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)](http://www.osti.gov/search)\nBolotov, V.

The observed increase in the free carrier concentration in the por-Si/SnO{sub x} nanocomposite layers is explained by a change in the charge state of P{sub b} centers due to the formation of neutral 'surface defect-adsorbed NO{sub 2} molecule' complexes with free carrier generation in the crystallite bulk. In the nanocomposite layers grown by the CVD method, the increase in the free hole concentration during NO{sub 2}more \u00bb adsorption is much less pronounced in comparison with the composite grown by magnetron deposition, which is caused by the competing interaction channel of NO{sub 2} molecules with electrically neutral P{sub b} centers.\u00ab less\n[Simplificando a luneta com lente de \u00f3culos](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003BASBr..23...71C) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html)\nCanalle, J.

As ligas usadas possuem excelentes propriedades mecanicas mas apresentam simultaneamente uma grande tendencia para a corrosao. Por esta razao essas ligas necessitam de proteccao anticorrosiva eficaz para poderem ser utilizadas com seguranca. Ate a data, os sistemas anticorrosivos mais eficazes para ligas de aluminio contem cromio hexavalente na sua composicao, sejam pre-tratamentos, camadas de conversao ou pigmentos anticorrosivos. O reconhecimento dos efeitos carcinogenicos do cromio hexavalente levou ao aparecimento de legislacao banindo o uso desta forma de cromio pela industria. Esta decisao trouxe a necessidade de encontrar alternativas ambientalmente inocuas mas igualmente eficazes. O principal objectivo do presente trabalho e o desenvolvimento de pretratamentos anticorrosivos activos para a liga de aluminio 2024, baseados em revestimentos hibridos produzidos pelo metodo sol-gel. Estes revestimentos deverao possuir boa aderencia ao substrato metalico, boas propriedades barreira e capacidade anticorrosiva activa. A proteccao activa pode ser alcancada atraves da incorporacao de inibidores anticorrosivos no pretratamento. O objectivo foi atingido atraves de uma sucessao de etapas. Primeiro investigou-se em detalhe a corrosao localizada (por picada) da liga de aluminio 2024. Os resultados obtidos permitiram uma melhor compreensao da susceptibilidade desta liga a processos de corrosao localizada. Estudaram-se tambem varios possiveis inibidores de corrosao usando tecnicas electroquimicas e microestruturais. Numa segunda etapa desenvolveram-se revestimentos anticorrosivos hibridos organico-inorganico baseados no metodo sol-gel. Compostos derivados de titania e zirconia foram combinados com siloxanos organofuncionais a fim de obter-se boa aderencia entre o revestimento e o substrato metalico assim como boas propriedades barreira.

For example, an agrodynamic system is composed of flora and fauna on one scale; soil types, slope, and water runoff on another scale; and management practice and yield on another scale. Or consider an advanced coal-fired power plant: combustion and pollutant formation occurs on one scale, the plant components on another scale, and the overall performance of the power system is measured on another. In spite of this, there are few practical tools for the optimization of multiscale systems.

Our aim was to describe health resource use and costs of heart failure admissions in three important institutions in Argentina. Multi-center retrospective cohort study, with descriptive and analytical analysis by subgroups of ejection fraction, blood pressure and renal function at admission. Generalized linear models were used to assess the association of independent variables to main outcomes. We included 301 subjects; age 75.3\u00b111.8 years; 37% women; 57% with depressed ejection fraction; 46% of coronary etiology. Blood pressure at admission was 129.8\u00b129.7 mmHg; renal function 57.9\u00b126.2 ml/min/1.73 m 2 . Overall mortality was 7%. Average length of stay was 7.82\u00b17.06 days (median 5.69), and was significantly longer in patients with renal impairment (8.9 vs. 8.18; p=0.03) and shorter in those with high initial blood pressure (6.08\u00b14.03; p=0.009). Mean cost per patient was AR$68,861\u00b196,066 (US$=8,071; 1US$=AR$8.532); 71% attributable to hospital stay, 20% to interventional procedures and 6.7% to diagnostic studies. Variables independently associated with higher costs were depressed ejection fraction, presence of valvular disease, and impaired renal function. Resource use and costs associated to hospitalizations for heart failure is high, and the highest proportion is attributable to the costs related to hospital stay. Copyright \u00a9 2017.

El uso de una caja cerrada permite observar el contraste entre las diferentes fases sin necesidad de estar en un recinto oscuro. Presentamos tambi\u00e9n un texto explicativo sobre las fases de la Luna, enfatizando la dependencia de la apariencia de la parte iluminada con el \u00e1ngulo de visi\u00f3n.

Este trastorno dual puede tener efectos dram\u00e1ticos en el curso cl\u00ednico del trastorno psic\u00f3tico tales como: mayores reca\u00eddas, re-hospitalizaciones, s\u00edntomas m\u00e1s severos, no adherencia al tratamiento antipsic\u00f3tico, cambios marcados del humor, aumento en el grado de hostilidad e ideaci\u00f3n suicida, as\u00ed como alteraciones en otras \u00e1reas del funcionamiento incluyendo violencia, victimizaci\u00f3n, indigencia y problemas legales. La literatura proveniente en particular de Estados Unidos y Europa sugiere que el rango de prevalencia para este diagn\u00f3stico puede oscilar entre el 10% hasta el 70%. En este estudio, revisamos la prevalencia del diagn\u00f3stico dual de esquizofrenia y trastorno en el uso sustancias, as\u00ed como sus caracter\u00edsticas sociodemogr\u00e1ficas, con base en la literatura disponible alrededor del mundo dando \u00e9nfasis en la poblacion latina. A pesar de que este diagn\u00f3stico es ampliamente aceptado, se conoce poco sobre su prevalencia en la poblaci\u00f3n latina, sobre los factores ambientales, demogr\u00e1ficos, cl\u00ednicos y otras caracter\u00edsticas de estos individuos.

Resalta tambi\u00e9n la investigaci\u00f3n sobre el metabolismo bacteriano, que ha aportado conocimientos sobre la defensa natural oral contra la caries y la base para el desarrollo de una nueva tecnolog\u00eda para la prevenci\u00f3n diaria y el tratamiento de la caries. Por \u00faltimo, se resume la evidencia que respalda que la tecnolog\u00eda complementa y mejora la eficacia anti-caries de la crema dental con fluoruro. los datos globales muestran que a pesar de la exitosa introducci\u00f3n del fluoruro, la caries dental es una enfermedad prevalente. La experiencia de caries depende del balance entre el consumo de az\u00facares, la higiene oral y el uso del fluoruro. Hay tres conceptos cient\u00edficos que son fundamentales en las nuevas mediciones para detectar, tratar y monitorear la caries: (1) la caries dental es un proceso din\u00e1mico, (2) la caries dental es un proceso continuo de etapas que van desde reversible (pre-cl\u00ednica) hasta irreversible (lesiones cl\u00ednicamente detectables), y (3) el proceso de la caries es un balance de factores patol\u00f3gicos y protectores que pueden modularse para el manejo de la caries. El fluoruro funciona como factor protector al detener y revertir el proceso de la caries, pero el fluoruro no previene los factores patol\u00f3gicos que inician el proceso. Se ha identificado una tecnolog\u00eda novedosa, basada en arginina y un compuesto insoluble de calcio, que est\u00e1 dirigida a la placa dental para prevenir la iniciaci\u00f3n del proceso de caries al reducir los factores patol\u00f3gicos. Como los mecanismos de acci\u00f3n de la arginina y el fluoruro son altamente complementarios, se ha desarrollado un nuevo dent\u00edfrico que combina la arginina y el fluoruro, y se ha probado cl\u00ednicamente que brinda una prevenci\u00f3n superior contra la caries.

Opioid drug provocation testing (DPT) is the gold standard for diagnosis but is underutilized. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and predictors of opioid hypersensitivity, as well as outcomes of opioid DPT. Patients referred for opioid DPT over the past 9 years were studied. Patient characteristics, indications for opioid use, symptoms of index reaction, and outcomes of DPT were analyzed. Association analysis was performed to study variables associated with a diagnosis of opioid hypersensitivity. Of the total of 98 patients referred with suspected opioid hypersensitivity, 15 (15%) were diagnosed with opioid allergy. Angioedema (odds ratio [OR]: 5.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.49-21.47; P = .011) and hypotension (OR: 5.00; 95% CI: 1.15-21.70; P = .032) were significantly more frequent in opioid allergic patients than those with a negative DPT. Patients who received opioids during anesthesia were significantly more likely to be opioid allergic (OR: 6.74; 95% CI: 2.05-22.13; P = .001). In contrast, a negative association was identified with patients who received opioids for analgesia (OR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08-0.86; P = .008). Only 15% of our cohort were diagnosed with opioid allergy, emphasizing the importance of DPT in preventing erroneous overdiagnosis. Patients with a history of angioedema or hypotension as their index reaction were significantly more likely to be opioid allergic. DPT are safe when performed by experienced clinicians after risk stratification and using individualized protocols. Copyright \u00a9 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Our retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the effects of sacubitril/valsartan in addition to a beta-blocker and mineral receptor antagonist (MRA) in a group of HFREF patients with NYHA class II-III HF vs. conventional therapy (ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker added to a beta-blocker plus an MRA) administered to a control group of HFREF patients with comparable clinical features. In both groups, treatment was supplemented by a loop diuretic, usually furosemide, at variable doses. The primary outcomes were all-cause death and HF hospitalizations. Safety outcomes were symptomatic hypotension, angioedema, hyperkalemia, and worsening renal function. Mortality at 6 months was 6.8% in patients taking sacubitril/valsartan vs. 34% in those on conventional therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.14; 95% CI: 0.04-0.49). Moreover, there was a 4.5% rate of HF hospitalizations in the sacubitril/valsartan group vs. 59% in the control group (OR = 0.03; 95% CI: 0.01-0.14). Safety outcomes were comparable in the two groups, although hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg) was found in 15.9% of patients in the sacubitril/valsartan group vs. 5.7% in the control group (OR = 3.14; 95% CI: 0.94-10.55). Sacubitril/valsartan offered strong protection against all-cause death and HF hospitalizations at 6 months without any significant side effects. To validate this efficacious molecule, further postmarketing observational studies, focusing mainly on hypotension and angioedema are warranted.\n[Gene interference regulates aquaporin-4 expression in swollen tissue of rats with cerebral ischemic edema](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4308770)\nHu, Hui; Lu, Hong; He, Zhanping; Han, Xiangjun; Chen, Jing; Tu, Rong\n2012-01-01\nTo investigate the effects of mRNA interference on aquaporin-4 expression in swollen tissue of rats with ischemic cerebral edema, and diagnose the significance of diffusion-weighted MRI, we injected 5 \u03bcL shRNA- aquaporin-4 (control group) or siRNA- aquaporin-4 solution (1:800) (RNA interference group) into the rat right basal ganglia immediately before occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. At 0.25 hours after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, diffusion-weighted MRI displayed a high signal; within 2 hours, the relative apparent diffusion coefficient decreased markedly, aquaporin-4 expression increased rapidly, and intracellular edema was obviously aggravated; at 4 and 6 hours, the relative apparent diffusion coefficient slowly returned to control levels, aquaporin-4 expression slightly increased, and angioedema was observed. In the RNA interference group, during 0.25\u20136 hours after injection of siRNA- aquaporin-4 solution, the relative apparent diffusion coefficient slightly fluctuated and aquaporin-4 expression was upregulated; during 0.5\u20134 hours, the relative apparent diffusion coefficient was significantly higher, while aquaporin-4 expression was significantly lower when compared with the control group, and intracellular edema was markedly reduced; at 0.25 and 6 hours, the relative apparent diffusion coefficient and aquaporin-4 expression were similar when compared with the control group; obvious angioedema remained at 6 hours. Pearson's correlation test results showed that aquaporin-4 expression was negatively correlated with the apparent diffusion coefficient (r = \u22120.806, P < 0.01). These findings suggest that upregulated aquaporin-4 expression is likely to be the main molecular mechanism of intracellular edema and may be the molecular basis for decreased relative apparent diffusion coefficient. Aquaporin-4 gene interference can effectively inhibit the upregulation of aquaporin-4 expression during the stage of intracellular edema with time\n[Gene interference regulates aquaporin-4 expression in swollen tissue of rats with cerebral ischemic edema: Correlation with variation in apparent diffusion coefficient.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25657707)\nHu, Hui; Lu, Hong; He, Zhanping; Han, Xiangjun; Chen, Jing; Tu, Rong\n2012-07-25\nTo investigate the effects of mRNA interference on aquaporin-4 expression in swollen tissue of rats with ischemic cerebral edema, and diagnose the significance of diffusion-weighted MRI, we injected 5 \u03bcL shRNA- aquaporin-4 (control group) or siRNA- aquaporin-4 solution (1:800) (RNA interference group) into the rat right basal ganglia immediately before occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.

A selected review was undertaken of publications examining the preclinical and clinical studies of drugs aimed at enhancing the activity of the endogenous natriuretic peptide system and their combination with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, initially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and more recently angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers. Selective neprilysin inhibitors are unlikely to be of benefit and may be associated with adverse effects when used in isolation in HF. Combining NIs with ACEIs is unsafe because of an unacceptably high prevalence of angioedema, which may be mediated by elevated levels of endogenous bradykinin. Combining a neprilysin inhibitor with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers avoids the risk for angioedema. The ARNI LCZ696 was associated with greater reductions both mortality and morbidity compared with those with enalapril in a large-scale, Phase III clinical trial in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Findings from a Phase II clinical trial suggested that LCZ696 may also be beneficial in HF with preserved ejection fraction, and a Phase III clinical trial of LCZ696 used for this indication is under way. ARNIs have been described as a \"game changer\" by cardiologists. Based on findings from clinical trials conducted to date, there is an expectation that they will replace ACEIs as a building block of the pharmacologic treatment of chronic HF.

Here we report a patient who was initially erroneously diagnosed and treated for SAID. Symptoms consisted of recurrent fever, erythematous and/or blistering skin lesions, angioedema, susceptibility to bleeding, external ear infections and reversible anisocoria in the absence of laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation. After two and a half years of extensive diagnostic work-up and multiple empirical therapies, a final diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy syndrome (MBPS) was established. The diagnosis of SAID needs to be carefully reassessed if measurable systemic inflammation is missing, and MBPS should be included in the differential diagnosis.\n[[Allergology and clinical immunology].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29337441)\nCoattrenec, Yann; Harr, Thomas; Chizzolini, Carlo; Jandus, Peter\n2018-01-10\nHereditary angioedema (HA) is a disabling and potentially fatal condition. The management of HA includes treatment of acute attacks, short-term prophylaxis to prevent an attack, and long-term prophylaxis to minimize the frequency and severity of recurrent attacks. In this article, we will present new therapeutic alternatives for long term prophylaxis. Glucocorticoids (GC) usage leads to a number of severe side-effects. In giant cell arteritis, the use of tocilizumab in conjunction with low doses of GC reduces the number of relapses. In ANCA-associated vasculitis the use of an anti-C5R (avacopan) alone or in conjunction with low doses of GC results in similar remission rates to those induced by high dose GC.\n[Immediate hypersensitivity reaction following liposomal amphotericin-B (AmBisome) infusion.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139411)\nNath, Proggananda; Basher, Ariful; Harada, Michiyo; Sarkar, Santana; Selim, Shahjada; Maude, Richard J; Noiri, Eisei; Faiz, Abul\n2014-10-01\nLiposomal amphotericin-B (AmBisome) is now becoming first choice for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) patients due to high efficacy and less toxicity. The reported incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to liposomal amphotericin-B (AmBisome), especially during therapy, is very rare. We report two patients with kala-azar: one developed breathing difficulties and hypotension followed by shock and the other had facial angioedema with chest tightness during treatment. Both patients were managed with immediate action of injection: adrenaline, diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone. In our experience, AmBisome can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions that warrant proper support and close supervision. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.\n[Asthma and allergy in pregnancy.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9209810)\nSchatz, M; Zeiger, R S\n1997-06-01\nRhinitis is extremely common during pregnancy, and asthma is one of the most common potentially serious medical problems to complicate pregnancy. Cutaneous allergy (urticaria/angioedema and eczema) also may occur during pregnancy. All of these entities may worsen with pregnancy in some patients and appear to improve in others. Uncontrolled asthma may directly threaten the fetus, and morbidity from the other illnesses may indirectly affect pregnancy through an effect on eating, sleeping, or emotional well-being. Appropriate diagnosis, avoiding triggering factors when possible; appropriate use of pharmacotherapy; and, when indicated, allergen immunotherapy usually allow these chronic conditions to be controlled during pregnancy so as to optimize both the health of the mother and that of her baby.\n[Adult Student Retention and Achievement with Language-Based Modular Materials.

A total of 355 fresh samples of dogs faeces were collected from bins provided for the disposal of dog faeces in 10 walkways in Palmerston North, New Zealand, between August 2008-July 2009. Presumptive Campylobacter colonies, cultured on modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate plates, were screened for genus Campylobacter and C. jejuni by PCR. The C. jejuni isolates were subsequently characterised by MLST and porA and flaA typing, and C. jejuni sequence types (ST) were assigned. Of the 355 samples collected, 72 (20 (95% CI=16-25)%) were positive for Campylobacter spp. and 22 (6 (95% CI=4-9)%) were positive for C. jejuni. Of the 22 C. jejuni isolates, 19 were fully typed by MLST. Ten isolates were assigned to the clonal complex ST-45 and three to ST-52. The allelic combinations of ST-45/flaA 21/porA 44 (n=3), ST-45/flaA 22/porA 53 (n=3) and ST-52/ flaA 57/porA 905 (n=3) were most frequent. The successful isolation of C. jejuni from canine faecal samples collected from faecal bins provides evidence that Campylobacter spp. may survive outside the host for at least several hours despite requiring fastidious growth conditions in culture. The results show that dogs carry C. jejuni genotypes (ST-45, ST-50, ST-52 and ST-696) that have been reported in human clinical cases. Although these results do not provide any evidence either for the direction of infection or for dogs being a potential risk factor for human campylobacteriosis, dog owners are advised to practice good hygiene with respect to their pets to reduce potential exposure to infection.\n[Comportamiento Sexual y Autoeficacia para la Negociaci\u00f3n de Sexo M\u00e1s Seguro en Personas Heterosexuales](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3403820)\nP\u00e9rez-Jim\u00e9nez, David; Santiago-Rivas, Marimer; Serrano-Garc\u00eda, Irma\n2012-01-01\nLa autoeficacia se le ha identificado como uno de los factores que puede facilitar o dificultar llevar a cabo sexo m\u00e1s seguro.

Recently, immunoglobulin products with improved compositions and for subcutaneous use have become available in Brazil. In order to guide physicians on the use of human immunoglobulin to treat primary immunodeficiencies, based on a narrative literature review and their professional experience, the members of the Primary Immunodeficiency Group of the Brazilian Society of Allergy and Immunology prepared an updated document of the 1st Brazilian Consensus, published in 2010. The document presents new knowledge about the indications and efficacy of immunoglobulin therapy in primary immunodeficiencies, relevant production-related aspects, mode of use (routes of administration, pharmacokinetics, doses and intervals), adverse events (major, prevention, treatment and reporting), patient monitoring, presentations available and how to have access to this therapeutic resource in Brazil. RESUMO Nos \u00faltimos anos, novas imunodefici\u00eancias prim\u00e1rias e defeitos gen\u00e9ticos t\u00eam sido descritos. Recentemente, produtos de imunoglobulina, com aprimoramento em sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o e para uso por via subcut\u00e2nea, tornaram-se dispon\u00edveis em nosso meio. Com o objetivo de orientar o m\u00e9dico no uso da imunoglobulina humana para o tratamento das imunodefici\u00eancias prim\u00e1rias, os membros do Grupo de Assessoria em Imunodefici\u00eancias da Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Alergia e Imunologia produziram um documento que teve por base uma revis\u00e3o narrativa da literatura e sua experi\u00eancia profissional, atualizando o I Consenso Brasileiro publicado em 2010.

Este sistema de localizacao foi concebido para poder operar em ambientes onde qualquer outra tecnologia nao pode ser utilizada ou o seu uso esta condicionado, como sao exemplo aplicacoes subaquaticas ou ambientes hospitalares. O sistema de localizacao proposto faz uso de uma rede de farois fixos permitindo que estacoes moveis se localizem. Devido a necessidade de transmissao de dados e medicao de distancias foi desenvolvido um pulso de ultrassons robusto a ecos que permite realizar ambas as tarefas com sucesso. O sistema de localizacao permite que as estacoes moveis se localizem escutando apenas a informacao em pulsos de ultrassons enviados pelos farois usando para tal um algoritmo baseado em diferencas de tempo de chegada. Desta forma a privacidade dos utilizadores e garantida e o sistema torna-se completamente independente do numero de utilizadores. Por forma a facilitar a implementacao da rede de farois apenas sera necessario determinar manualmente a posicao de alguns dos farois, designados por farois ancora. Estes irao permitir que os restantes farois, completamente autonomos, se possam localizar atraves de um algoritmo iterativo de localizacao baseado na minimizacao de uma funcao de custo. Para que este sistema possa funcionar como previsto sera necessario que os farois possam sincronizar os seus relogios e medir a distancia entre eles. Para tal, esta tese propoe um protocolo de sincronizacao de relogio que permite tambem obter as medidas de distancia entre os farois trocando somente tres mensagens de ultrassons. Adicionalmente, o sistema de localizacao permite que farois danificados possam ser substituidos sem comprometer a operabilidade da rede reduzindo a complexidade na manutencao. Para alem do mencionado, foi igualmente implementado um simulador de ultrassons para ambientes fechados, o qual provou ser bastante\n[A resolution recognizing May 16, 2012, as Hereditary Angioedema Awareness Day and expressing the sense of the Senate that more research and treatments are needed for Hereditary Angioedema.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-resolution/286?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Research%22%5D%7D&r=90)\nSen.

Factors associated with immigrants\u2019 access to, and use of, healthcare were sex, urban/rural status, education and country of origin. Conclusion There were significant associations between SES, and access to and use of healthcare among immigrants in Chile and a higher prevalence of no health care provision entitlement among poor and disabled immigrants compared to the Chilean-born. Changing associations between access and use of healthcare and SES among immigrants in Chile over time may reflect changes in their socio-demographic composition or in the survey methodology between 2006 and 2009.

Sudden manifestations of CU with or without known causes are termed chronic spontaneous urticaria, which is differentiated from chronic inducible urticaria. The differential diagnoses of CU in childhood range from self-limiting dermatoses to severe systemic diseases. Further targeted steps are taken to detect potential trigger factors or underlying illnesses only if suspicion arises on anamnestic grounds and CU is best treated in accordance with international guidelines. First-line therapy consists of non-sedating H 1 -antihistamines at approved or even higher doses. If symptoms persist, additional treatment with omalizumab, cyclosporine or montelukast can be initiated after careful individual consideration.\n[CONTAMINACI\u00d3N AMBIENTAL, VARIABILIDAD CLIM\u00c1TICA Y CAMBIO CLIM\u00c1TICO: UNA REVISI\u00d3N DEL IMPACTO EN LA SALUD DE LA POBLACI\u00d3N PERUANA](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4351992)\nGonzales, Gustavo F.; Zevallos, Alisson; Gonzales-Casta\u00f1eda, Cynthia; Nu\u00f1ez, Denisse; Gasta\u00f1aga, Carmen; Cabezas, C\u00e9sar; Naeher, Luke; Levy, Karen; Steenland, Kyle\n2015-01-01\nRESUMEN El presente art\u00edculo es una revisi\u00f3n sobre la contaminaci\u00f3n del agua, el aire y el efecto del cambio clim\u00e1tico en la salud de la poblaci\u00f3n peruana. Uno de los principales contaminantes del aire es el material particulado menor de 2,5 \u03bc (PM 2,5), en la ciudad de Lima, anualmente 2300 muertes prematuras son atribuibles a este contaminante. Otro problema es la contaminaci\u00f3n del aire domiciliario por el uso de cocinas con combustible de biomasa, donde la exposici\u00f3n excesiva a PM 2,5 dentro de las casas es responsable de aproximadamente 3000 muertes prematuras anuales entre adultos, con otro n\u00famero desconocido de muertes entre ni\u00f1os debido a infecciones respiratorias. La contaminaci\u00f3n del agua tiene como principales causas los desag\u00fces vertidos directamente a los r\u00edos, minerales (ars\u00e9nico) de varias fuentes, y fallas de las plantas de tratamiento.

Descriptive, retrospective study, classifying independent variables in seven key dimensions: identification/risk rating; length of stay/use of advanced life support; imaging; clinical analysis; special procedures; blood products in the intensive care unit; and in the operating room. The frequencies were analyzed by linear regression analysis of variance to detect relevance due to the dependent variable (severity indicator) in 76 cases seen in 2013. Among the variables studied, those that presented relevance due to the functional risk score were laboratory measurements of bilirubin, amylase, transaminase, blood count, creatine phosphokinase (p<0.05), hemotherapy procedures fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelet concentrate (p<0.05), and Doppler echocardiography image (p<0.07).

Estos principios describen la necesidad de manejar la naturaleza en t\u00e9rminos de ecosistemas din\u00e1micos, mientras se compromete totalmente con las personas locales. Es un concepto ambicioso. Hoy en d\u00eda, el t\u00e9rmino es com\u00fan en la investigaci\u00f3n y la literatura de pol\u00edticas sobre el manejo ambiente. Sin embargo, se han relacionado m\u00faltiples significados con el t\u00e9rmino, lo que resulta en confusi\u00f3n. Revisamos referencias a la estrategia ambiental de 1957 a 2012 e identificamos tres usos principales: como una alternativa para manejo ambiental o basado en ecosistemas; en referencia a una estrategia integrada y equitativa para el manejo de recursos seg\u00fan la CBD; y como un t\u00e9rmino que indica un enfoque en el entendimiento y la valuaci\u00f3n de los servicios ambientales. Aunque los usos de este t\u00e9rmino y sus variantes pueden traslaparse en su significado, t\u00edpicamente no reflejan en su totalidad los valores de la estrategia ambiental como fue definida por la CBD. Por ejemplo, actualmente hay un \u00e9nfasis creciente en los servicios ambientales, pero enfocarse solamente en estos no promueve la descentralizaci\u00f3n del manejo o el uso de todas las formas de conocimiento, siendo ambas integrales para el concepto de la CBD. Resaltamos que los Principios de Malawi est\u00e1n en riesgo de ser olvidados. Para entender mejor estos principios, se requiere de m\u00e1s esfuerzo para implementarlos. Dichos esfuerzos deben ser evaluados, id\u00f3neamente con estrategias comparativas, antes de permitir que el concepto de la CBD de manejo hol\u00edstico y comprometido socialmente sea abandonado o reemplazado.

This cross-sectional population-based study was conducted using data from the PNAUM (National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines), collected between September 2013 and February 2014 by interviews at the homes of the respondents. All people who reported using any medicines not prescribed by a doctor or dentist were classified as self-medication practitioners. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (Poisson regression) and their respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated in order to investigate the factors associated with the use of self-medication by medicines. The independent variables were: sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions and access to and use of health services. In addition, the most commonly consumed medicines by self-medication were individually identified. The self-medication prevalence in Brazil was 16.1% (95%CI 15.0-17.5), with it being highest in the Northeast region (23.8%; 95%CI 21.6-26.2). Following the adjusted analysis, self-medication was observed to be associated with females, inhabitants from the North, Northeast and Midwest regions and individuals that have had one, or two or more chronic diseases. Analgesics and muscle relaxants were the therapeutic groups most used for self-medication, with dipyrone being the most consumed medicines. In general, most of the medicines used for self-medication were classified as non-prescriptive (65.5%). Self-medication is common practice in Brazil and mainly involves the use of non-prescription medicines; therefore, the users of such should be made aware of the possible risks.

Further, the in vivo effector functions of antibodies may vary depending on their specificity and Fc heavy-chain isotype. In this study, a mouse immunoglobulin G2a (mIgG2a) monoclonal antibody (MN12H2) to meningococcal outer membrane protein PorA (P1.16), its human IgG subclass derivatives (hIgG1 to hIgG4), and an mIgG2a monoclonal antibody (Nmb735) to serogroup B capsular polysaccharide (B-PS) were evaluated for passive protection against meningococcal serogroup B strain 44/76-SL (B:15:P1.7,16) in an infant rat infection model. Complement component C6-deficient (PVG/c-) rats were used to assess the importance of complement-mediated bacterial lysis for protection. The PorA-specific parental mIgG2a and the hIgG1 to hIgG3 derivatives all induced efficient bactericidal activity in vitro in the presence of human or infant rat complement and augmented bacterial clearance in complement-sufficient HsdBrlHan:WIST rats, while the hIgG4 was unable to do so. In C6-deficient PVG/c- rats, lacking complement-mediated bacterial lysis, the augmentation of bacterial clearance by PorA-specific mIgG2a and hIgG1 antibodies was impaired compared to that in the syngeneic complement-sufficient PVG/c+ rat strain. This was in contrast to the case for B-PS-specific mIgG2a, which conferred similar protective activity in both rat strains. These data suggest that while anti-B-PS antibody can provide protection in the infant rats without membrane attack complex formation, the protection afforded by anti-PorA antibody is more dependent on the activation of the whole complement pathway and subsequent bacterial lysis.\n[Quality of nursing documentation before and after the Hospital Accreditation in a university hospital.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27878216)\nNomura, Aline Tsuma Gaedke; Silva, Marcos Barragan da; Almeida, Miriam de Abreu\n2016-11-21\nto analyze the quality of nursing documentation by comparing the periods before and after the preparation for the hospital accreditation, using the Quality of Nursing Diagnoses, Interventions and Outcomes - Brazilian version (Q-DIO- Brazilian version). observational study of interventions conducted in a university hospital.

Defined as an adverse immune response to common food allergens, FAs present heterogeneously as a single- or multi-organ response that ranges in severity from localized hives and angioedema to systemic anaphylaxis. Current research focusing on epithelial-derived cytokines contends that temporal regulation by these factors impact initial sensitization and persistence of FA responses upon repeated food allergen exposure. Mechanistic understanding of FA draws insight from a myriad of atopic conditions studied in humans and modeled in mice. In this review, we will highlight how epithelial-derived cytokines initiate and then potentiate FAs. We will also review existing evidence of the contribution of other atopic diseases to FA pathogenesis and whether FA symptoms overlap with other atopic diseases.\n[Shallow-water habitats as sources of fallback foods for hominins.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19890871)\nWrangham, Richard; Cheney, Dorothy; Seyfarth, Robert; Sarmiento, Esteban\n2009-12-01\nUnderground storage organs (USOs) have been proposed as critical fallback foods for early hominins in savanna, but there has been little discussion as to which habitats would have been important sources of USOs. USOs consumed by hominins could have included both underwater and underground storage organs, i.e., from both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Shallow aquatic habitats tend to offer high plant growth rates, high USO densities, and relatively continuous USO availability throughout the year. Baboons in the Okavango delta use aquatic USOs as a fallback food, and aquatic or semiaquatic USOs support high-density human populations in various parts of the world. As expected given fossilization requisites, the African early- to mid-Pleistocene shows an association of Homo and Paranthropus fossils with shallow-water and flooded habitats where high densities of plant-bearing USOs are likely to have occurred. Given that early hominins in the tropics lived in relatively dry habitats, while others occupied temperate latitudes, ripe, fleshy fruits of the type preferred by African apes would not normally have been available year round. We therefore suggest that water-associated USOs were likely to have been key fallback foods, and that dry-season access to aquatic habitats would have been an important predictor of hominin home range quality. This study differs from traditional savanna chimpanzee models of hominin origins by proposing that access to aquatic habitats was a necessary condition for adaptation to savanna habitats. It also raises the possibility that harvesting efficiency in shallow water promoted adaptations for habitual bipedality in early hominins.\n[Fabrication of por-Si/SnO{sub x} nanocomposite layers for gas microsensors and nanosensors](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22004804-fabrication-por-si-sno-sub-nanocomposite-layers-gas-microsensors-nanosensors) [DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)](http://www.osti.gov/search)\nBolotov, V.

Impact on DORIS phase measurement and DORIS station positioning](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AdSpR..62..174J) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html)\nJalabert, Eva; Mercier, Flavien\n2018-07-01\nDORIS measurements rely on the precise knowledge of the embedded oscillator which is called the Ultra Stable Oscillator (DORIS USO). The important radiations in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) perturb the USO behavior by causing rapid frequency variations when the satellite is flying through the SAA. These variations are not taken into account in standard DORIS processing, since the USO is modelled as a third degree polynomial over 7-10 days. Therefore, there are systematic measurements errors when the satellite passes through SAA. In standard GNSS processing, the clock is directly estimated at each epoch. On Sentinel-3A, the GPS receiver and the DORIS receiver use the same USO. It is thus possible to estimate the behavior of the USO using GPS measurements. This estimated USO behavior can be used in the DORIS processing, instead of the third degree polynomial, hence allowing an estimation of the orbit sensitivity to these USO anomalies. This study shows two main results. First, the SAA effect on the DORIS USO is observed well using GPS measurements. Second, the USO behavior observed with GPS can be used to mitigate the SAA effect. Indeed, when used in Sentinel-3A processing, the resulting DORIS orbit shows improved phase measurements and station positioning for stations inside the SAA (Arequipa and Cachoeira). The phase measurements residuals are improved by up to 10 cm, and station vertical positioning (i.e. on the estimated Up component in the North-East-Up station frame) is improved by up to a few centimeters. However, the orbit itself is not sensitive to the correction because only two stations (out of almost 60) are SAA-sensitive on Sentinel-3A.\n[The impact of the use of different types of gloves and bare hands for preparation of clean surgical instruments.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27737375)\nBruna, Camila Quartim de Moraes; Souza, Rafael Queiroz de; Massaia, Irineu Francisco Silva; Cruz, \u00c1urea Silveira; Graziano, Kazuko Uchikawa\n2016-10-10\nto determine if there are differences on the safety of the preparation of clean surgical instruments using different types of gloves and bare hands and evaluate the microbiological load of these preparations without gloves. laboratory procedure with a pragmatic approach, in which the samples were handled with different types of gloves and bare hands.

Recent research has identified a novel cause for \"idiopathic\" allergic reactions; immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody specific for the carbohydrate galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose (\u03b1-Gal) has been associated with delayed urticaria and anaphylaxis that occurs 3 to 6 hours after eating beef, pork, or lamb. We sought to determine whether IgE antibody to \u03b1-Gal was present in sera of pediatric patients who reported idiopathic anaphylaxis or urticaria. Patients aged 4 to 17 were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved protocol at the University of Virginia and private practice allergy offices in Lynchburg, VA. Sera was obtained and analyzed by ImmunoCAP for total IgE and specific IgE to \u03b1-Gal, beef, pork, cat epithelium and dander, Fel d 1, dog dander, and milk. Forty-five pediatric patients were identified who had both clinical histories supporting delayed anaphylaxis or urticaria to mammalian meat and IgE antibody specific for \u03b1-Gal. In addition, most of these cases had a history of tick bites within the past year, which itched and persisted. A novel form of anaphylaxis and urticaria that occurs 3 to 6 hours after eating mammalian meat is not uncommon among children in our area. Identification of these cases may not be straightforward and diagnosis is best confirmed by specific testing, which should certainly be considered for children living in the area where the Lone Star tick is common.\n[Being a mother and a por d\u00eda domestic worker. Companionship and deprivation.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7660660)\nBernal, P; Meleis, A I\n1995-08-01\nThis article presents qualitative findings concerning women's maternal roles, based on interviews conducted in a study on role integration and health, in a Colombian sample of 60 women who are \"por d\u00eda\" domestic workers. The results describe the women's worldview as they discuss the stresses and the satisfactions of their mothering roles. The results also include the coping strategies used to deal with the stresses inherent in the maternal role. Women describe how the companionship of their children, watching their children grow, and the nurturing they give their children provides them with pride and deep satisfaction. These satisfying aspects of their role are burdened by the stress related to worry about children's bad behavior, their illness, and a pervasive generalized sense of constant worry. Being single parents adds more stress to these women's lives. Participants coped emotionally through distraction and through talking with friends. Other coping strategies included calming self, problem solving, talking with children, and substance use. The authors conclude with a discussion of the relationship between poverty and work situation as contexts for understanding maternal roles.\n[Urticarial vasculitis induced by OTC diet pills: a case report.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25922639)\nCh\u00e9rrez Ojeda, Iv\u00e1n; Loayza, Enrique; Greiding, Leonardo; Calder\u00f3n, Juan Carlos; Cherrez, Annia; Adum, Farid\n2015-01-01\nUrticarial Vasculitis (UV) is in most of the cases idiopathic; however it has been associated with several conditions and drugs. Over the counter (OTC) diet pills are widely available, even on-line, but they are rarely regulated by pharmaceutical control. We present the case of a 35-year-old female patient suffering of pruriginous and painful wheals more than 1 cm in diameter, with a burning sensation. The eruption lasted more than 24 hours and was accompanied by angioedema, headache and myalgia. No remarkable medical history was found, except for previous intake of OTC diet pills. UV diagnosis was confirmed by the skin biopsy of a lesion. OTC diet pills are widely available worldwide, and due to its widespread use, allergologists and dermatologist should be able to recognize symptoms and lesions of cutaneous vasculitis, which may be under reported.\n[Diagnostic and therapeutic problems associated with hereditary deficiency of the C1 esterase inhibitor.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/872360)\nMolina, C; Brun, J; Coulet, M; Betail, G; Wahl, D; Hartmann, L\n1977-03-01\nSix patients in a family with a history of hereditary angioedema reported swelling of the extremities and recurrent abdominal pain occurring spontaneously or after trauma. Attacks of oedema involving the airways, the greatest danger with this disorder, were present only in one case. This autosomal dominant disease is due to deficient activity of the inhibitor of the first component of complement. Low levels of C4, and absence of C1 esterase inhibitor confirm the diagnosis. Two asymptomatic cases with the appropriate biochemical abnormality are reported in this study. For short term prophylaxis of attacks (before surgery expecially), fresh frozen plasma is used, or better still, C1 esterase inhibitor. For long term prophylaxis of attacks antifibrinolytic and hormonal drugs are used: in two cases, the authors obtained good results with methyltestosterone after failure of tranexamic acid.\n[Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis: A Diagnosis to Consider in a Patient With Cyclical Cutaneous Eruptions.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29036259)\nSteuer, Alexa B; Scherl, Sharon; Ashinoff, Robin\n2017-10-01\nAutoimmune progesterone dermatitis (APD) is a cyclical cutaneous reaction to progesterone, with symptoms that typically begin 3-10 days before the onset of menstrual flow and end 1-2 days into menses. The symptoms vary in severity from barely visible to anaphylaxis, but most often include an eczematous eruption, erythema multiforme, urticaria, folliculitis, and angioedema. This is a rare disorder with only a handful of documented cases. The pathogenesis of this condition remains unknown and significant variations in the presentation and severity of symptoms complicates its diagnosis. Treatment seeks to inhibit progesterone secretion through suppression of ovulation, but it may be unsuccessful.

The aim of the present study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a standard rapid desensitization protocol in patients with ASA sensitivity undergoing coronary angiography. This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study including 7 Italian centers including patients with a history of ASA sensitivity undergoing coronary angiography with intent to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. A total of 330 patients with history of ASA sensitivity with known/suspected stable coronary artery disease or presenting with an acute coronary syndrome, including ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction were enrolled. Adverse effects to aspirin included urticaria (n=177, 53.6%), angioedema (n=69, 20.9%), asthma (n=65, 19.7%), and anaphylactic reaction (n=19, 5.8%). Among patients with urticaria/angioedema, 13 patients (3.9%) had a history of idiopathic chronic urticaria. All patients underwent a rapid ASA (5.5 hours) desensitization procedure. The desensitization procedure was performed before cardiac catheterization in all patients, except for those (n=78, 23.6%) presenting with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction who underwent the desensitization after primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 235 patients (71%) of the overall study population. The desensitization procedure was successful in 315 patients (95.4%) and in all patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction. Among the 15 patients (4.6%) who did not successfully respond to the desensitization protocol, adverse reactions were minor and responded to treatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines. Among patients with successful in-hospital ASA desensitization, 253 patients (80.3%) continued ASA for at least 12 months. Discontinuation of ASA in the 62 patients (19.7%) who had responded to the desensitization protocol was because of medical\n[Immunogenicity assessment of recombinant human c1-inhibitor: an integrated analysis of clinical studies.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22928662)\nHack, C Erik; Mannesse, Maurice; Baboeram, Aartie; Oortwijn, Beatrijs; Relan, Anurag\n2012-10-01\nRecombinant human C1-inhibitor (rhC1INH) is used to treat acute angioedema attacks in hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to a genetic C1INH deficiency. Recombinant proteins in general may induce antibody responses and therefore evaluation of such responses in the target population is an essential step in the clinical development program of a recombinant protein. Here we report the assessment of the immunogenicity of rhC1INH in symptomatic HAE patients. Blood samples collected before and after administration of rhC1INH were tested for antibodies against plasma-derived (pd) or rhC1INH, or against host-related impurities (HRI). Above cut-off screening results were confirmed with displacement assays, and also tested for neutralizing anti-C1INH antibodies. Finally, the relation of antibodies to clinical efficacy and safety of rhC1INH was analyzed. Data from 155 HAE patients who received 424 treatments with rhC1INH were analyzed. 1.5% of all pre-exposure tests and 1.3% of all post-exposure tests were above the cut-off level in the screening assay for anti-C1INH antibodies. Six patients (3.9%) had anti-rhC1INH antibodies positive in the confirmatory assay. In two patients, confirmed antibodies were pre-existing with no increase post-exposure; in three patients, the antibodies occurred on a single occasion post-exposure; and in one patient, on subsequent occasions post-exposure. Neutralizing anti-pdC1INH antibodies were not found. Anti-HRI antibodies in the screening assay occurred in <0.7% of the tests before exposure to rhC1INH, in <1.9% after first exposure and in <3.1% after repeat treatment with rhC1INH. Five patients had anti-HRI antibodies positive in the confirmatory assay. In one patient, the antibodies were pre-existing, whereas in three of the 155 rhC1INH-treated patients (1.9%), confirmed anti-HRI antibodies occurred at more time points. Antibody findings were not associated with altered efficacy of rhC1INH or adverse events. These results indicate a reassuring\n[584 Frequency of Autoreactivity Demonstrated by Autologous Serum Skin Test in Patients with Chronic Urticaria in the Valley of Mexico During a Period of 8 Years](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3513116)\nRojo Guti\u00e9rrez, Mar\u00eda Isabel; Mellado-Abrego, Jaime; Gonzalez-Ibarra, Misael; Sandoval, Teresa; Bermejo, Mario-Alberto\n2012-01-01\nBackground Urticaria is a skin disease characterized by rapid emergence of hives, accompanied or not with angioedema. Usually lasts less than 24 hours. Approximately 12 to 24 per cent of the population will have hives or angioedema at least once in their life. Some patients with chronic urticaria has been classified as autoimmune. The autologous serum skin test (ASST) has been used to show pro-inflammatory circulating endogenous factors and it is regarded as a test for autorreactividad. The autorreactividad does not define an autoimmune urticaria, but may be an indicator of the presence of auto- reactive antibodies with the capacity of to activate the mast cells however functional antibodies need to be confirmed through of release of basophils histamine test from basophils (BHRA) and its specificity immunoassay (Western Blot or ELISA)-confirmed. Objective: to evaluate the auto-reactivity by autologous serum skin test in patients with chronic urticaria idiopathic in a study of 8 years. Material and methods: we made 216 ASST and autologous plasma skin test (APST) in patients with chronic urticaria without specific cause identified, of any age, during the period of 2003 to 2011. Results Thirty five thousand patients were evaluated only 261 patients not identified the cause (0.6%) and we realized ASST, of these 190 (88%) were negative, and 26 (12%) were positive, 20 (76.9 %) were female and 6 (23.1%) male, the median of age for women was 30 years ago with medium of 28 and men average 29 years and median 20. Of the 26 patients one was positive for anti-thyroglobulin senior titles (1: 170) .dos with positive anti unclears and one with pANCA and cANCA positive of a total of 216 patients, 156 (72.2) had APST and 60 (27.8%) were positive, 46 (76.6%) women and 14 (23.3 %) men. Mc Neman concordance between tests P < 0.0001 and Kappa index gives us a highly significant concordance P < 0.0001.

Advanced therapies have prolonged survival in patients with advanced heart failure, but pharmacotherapeutic optimization remains the mainstay of treatment. It has been over 10 years since the last mortality-reducing medication has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This article reviews the background, current knowledge and data supporting the use of sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto(\u00ae) ), the newly FDA-approved medication that dually inhibits angiotensin and neprilysin, in the treatment of heart failure. A literature search was performed (January 1980 to August 2015) using PubMed and the search terms were as follows: neprilysin inhibitor, heart failure, endopeptidase, natriuretic peptides, angiotensin, omapatrilat, LCZ696, valsartan and sacubitril. Peer-reviewed, published clinical trials, review articles, relevant treatment guidelines and prescribing information documents were identified and reviewed for relevance. Additionally, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed. The inhibition of endopeptidases has been an area of extensive study for the treatment of heart failure. Previously published literature with the endopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat failed to demonstrate a sufficient balance between clinical efficacy and safety to justify its approval. Omapatrilat blocked three pathways that break down bradykinin, leading to high rates of angioedema. Sacubitril, on the other hand, is metabolized to a form that is highly selective for neprilysin without possessing activity for the other two peptidases, ACE and APP. The combination of sacubitril with valsartan in a single formulation offers the benefit of concurrent blockade of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and the inhibition of neprilysin while minimizing angioedema risk. When compared to ACE inhibitor therapy in systolic heart failure patients, sacubitril/valsartan demonstrated reductions in\n[Enhancing the Art of Space Operations - Progress in JHU/APL Ultra-Stable Oscillator Capabilities](http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA503333)\n2008-12-01\nsolution for robust extraterrestrial clocks with an operational life requirement greater than 10 years.

Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially fatal, multi-organ allergic reac-tion. Our aim was to characterize the population with food induced anaphylaxis followed over a one-year period. Methods. Retrospective analysis of clinical files of patients with food anaphylaxis observed in our food allergy consultation during 2016. Results. Sixty-two patients were included. In the pediatric group, the implicated allergens were cow's milk, egg and fish and in the adults' group, the commonest allergens were nuts and wheat. Allergy to shrimp affected equally children and adults. The most frequent symptoms were urticaria (85.5%), angioedema (64.5%) and dyspnea (62.9%). Cofactors were present in 32.6% of patients, mainly exercise. Asthma and/or rhinitis were the most frequent comorbidities. Conclusion. In accordance to other studies, milk and egg were the most implicated allergens in children. Anaphylaxis in adults reflects the Mediterranean sensitization pattern. Exercise was the most relevant cofactor.\n[Adverse drug events in the oral cavity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25442252)\nYuan, Anna; Woo, Sook-Bin\n2015-01-01\nAdverse reactions to medications are common and may have a variety of clinical presentations in the oral cavity. Targeted therapies and the new biologic agents have revolutionized the treatment of cancers, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory and rheumatologic diseases but have also been associated with adverse events in the oral cavity. Some examples include osteonecrosis, seen with not only bisphosphonates but also antiangiogenic agents, and the distinctive ulcers caused by mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. As newer therapeutic agents are approved, it is likely that more adverse drug events will be encountered. This review describes the most common clinical presentations of oral mucosal reactions to medications, namely, xerostomia, lichenoid reactions, ulcers, bullous disorders, pigmentation, fibrovascular hyperplasia, white lesions, dysesthesia, osteonecrosis, infection, angioedema, and malignancy. Oral health care providers should be familiar with such events, as they will encounter them in their practice. Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Methods The results of 27 wrists were reviewed retrospectively. They were divided into three groups: group A (USO alone, 10 cases), group B (combined arthroscopic debridement and USO, 9 cases), and group C (arthroscopic triangular fibrocartilage complex [TFCC] debridement alone, 8 cases). The wrist function was evaluated using the modified Mayo wrist score, disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score and Chun and Palmer grading system. Results The modified Mayo wrist score in groups A, B, and C was 74.5 \u00b1 8.9, 73.9 \u00b1 11.6, and 61.3 \u00b1 10.2, respectively (p < 0.05). The DASH score in groups A, B, and C was 15.6 \u00b1 11.8, 19.3 \u00b1 11.9, and 33.2 \u00b1 8.5, respectively (p < 0.05). The average Chun and Palmer grading score in groups A and B was 85.7 \u00b1 8.9 and 84.7 \u00b1 6.7, respectively. The difference in the Mayo wrist score, DASH score and Chun and Palmer grading score between group A and B was not significant (p > 0.05). Conclusions Both USO alone and combined arthroscopic TFCC debridement with USO improved the wrist function and reduced the level of pain in the patients treated for ulnar impaction syndrome. USO alone may be the preferred method of treatment in patients if the torn flap of TFCC is not unstable.

The medical records of patients with BOTs who were treated between 1997 and 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. The recurrence rates were compared between the USO and cystectomy groups. The reproductive outcomes were assessed by telephone interviews. Patients with BOTs underwent a USO (n= 117) or cystectomy (n= 38). There were 12 patients who had recurrences: 1 patient had an invasive recurrence and 11 had borderline recurrences. The recurrence rate in the USO group (6.0%) was lower than in the cystectomy group (13.2%); however, this difference was not statistically significant (P= 0.110). All of the patients with recurrences were successfully treated with surgery and there was no clinical evidence of disease. Of the 116 patients contacted by telephone, 113 (97.4%) resumed menstruation following the surgery, and 45 of the 52 patients (86.5%) who attempted to conceive had successful pregnancies. USO (89.2%), like cystectomy (85.7%), resulted in excellent pregnancy rates for patients with BOTs. A USO is an appropriate treatment for women with BOTs who wish to preserve fertility. However, a cystectomy is a satisfactory fertility-sparing therapy when a cystectomy is the only surgical option.\n[Negative pressure of the environmental air in the cleaning area of the materials and sterilization center: a systematic review.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27598374)\nCiofi-Silva, Caroline Lopes; Hansen, Lisbeth Lima; Almeida, Alda Graciele Claudio Dos Santos; Kawagoe, Julia Yaeko; Padoveze, Maria Clara; Graziano, Kazuko Uchikawa\n2016-09-01\n, por\u00e9m n\u00e3o foram encontrados artigos cient\u00edficos sobre o impacto dessa interven\u00e7\u00e3o.

The management of anaphylaxis falls into two distinct phases: (1) emergency treatment and resuscitation of a patient with acute anaphylaxis and (2) the search for a cause for the event and the formulation of a plan to prevent and treat possible further episodes of anaphylaxis. Both aspects are important in preventing death from anaphylaxis and are covered in this review.

Reports of contact sensitivity to this gas are infrequent considering its widespread use as a local anesthetic, and it may have a relatively low sensitization potential. Benzocaine is another local anesthetic derivative of the ethyl ester of para-aminobenzoic acid, previously reported as a causative agent of delayed hypersensitivity reactions. We present a patient who developed a generalized itching dermatitis after the application of a medical aerosol containing EC, as well as facial angioedema and tongue swelling after the local application of benzocaine. Patch-test results were positive for EC \"as is\" (++), benzocaine 5% in petrolatum (++), and caine mix (+++) at 96 hours (day 4). The possibility of cross-sensitization between both drugs would not have been chemically plausible. We report the first published clinical case of contact allergic dermatitis from two chemically unrelated local anesthetics (EC and benzocaine) in the same patient.\n[Case of immediate hypersensitivity to beer.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26661797)\nInoue, Tomoko; Yagami, Akiko; Shimojo, Naoshi; Hara, Kazuhiro; Nakamura, Masashi; Matsunaga, Kayoko\n2016-06-01\nWe report here a case of immediate hypersensitivity to beer, in which a female patient developed angioedema of the eyelids shortly after consuming beer. In skin prick tests, the patient showed positive reactions to the base ingredients of beer, particularly malt and barley. The specific serum immunoglobulin E antibodies against barley and malt displayed weakly positive reactivity. To identify the immunoreactive antigens, malt and barley proteins were separated by 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoreacted with the patient's serum. The results of mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the main antigen was a protein with similarity to protein z-type serpin. Notably, the identified antigen had a molecular weight of 20-25 kDa, which is markedly smaller than that previously reported for protein Z4 (44 kDa). Taken together, these analyses indicate that a possible new antigen which belongs to the protein Z family elicits immediate hypersensitivity to beer. \u00a9 2015 Japanese Dermatological Association.\n[Subcutaneous infusion of human C1 inhibitor in swine.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20627701)\nJiang, Haixiang; Zhang, Hua-Mei; Frank, Michael M\n2010-09-01\nHereditary angioedema afflicts patients with unpredictable episodes of swelling that can be life threatening. Treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration for routine prophylaxis include danazol given orally and the nanofiltered human C1 esterase inhibitor, CINRYZE, which is approved for intravenous administration. Approved for the treatment of acute attacks are the C1 esterase inhibitor, Berinert, given intravenously, and the kallikrein inhibitor, KALBITOR, given subcutaneously. C1 inhibitor has generally been non-toxic and neither pro-inflammatory nor pro-fibrotic, suggesting that it may be suitable for subcutaneous infusion. The current study used a swine model to compare blood levels of human C1 inhibitor following intravenous and subcutaneous infusion, and the effect of infusion route on heart and skin pathology. Levels of C1 inhibitor achieved with SC infusion compared favorably with levels achieved after IV infusion and were relatively more stable than those after IV infusion. Neither cardiac nor skin toxicity was observed. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Two cases of systemic allergic reactions during skin testing to food allergens are hereby reported. A 28-year-old male reported allergic reactions, mild to moderate in severity, each time he tasted fish in the frame of his professional duties. During SPT and prick-to-prick to raw and cooked fishes, he presented urticaria and tachycardia. A 59-year-old male had a long history of urticaria-angioedema and asthma attacks, following the consumption of mammalian meat. He was skin-tested to various meats and during the 5 last minutes of the test he developed generalized urticaria, allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis. They were both advised to completely avoid the relative allergens. In conclusion, skin testing, particularly prick-to-prick, may cause anaphylaxis. Tests should be performed only by physicians with proper training in allergy, experienced in treating promptly and properly episodes of anaphylaxis.\n[Severe Adverse Reactions Following Ketoconazole, Fluconazole, and Environmental Exposures: A Case Report.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29671087)\nLieberman, Allan; Curtis, Luke\n2018-04-18\nIn this case report, we describe a 66-year-old man who developed multiple adverse reactions beginning at age 56 after exposure to several azole antifungal drugs including ketoconazole and fluconazole. He also had a history of more than 40 years exposure to chemicals including pesticides, wood preservatives, fertilizers, and welding chemicals. His reactions involved dehydration (requiring several liters of intravenous fluids in less than an hour to alleviate this condition), angioedema, nausea, tinnitus, hypotension, and difficulty breathing. His acute adverse reactions were triggered by a wide range of chemicals including gasoline, diesel fuel, pesticides, chlorine, topical isopropyl alcohol, and paper mill emissions. His acute reactions were also triggered by a wide range of foods such as bananas, apples, milk, white potatoes, and processed sweets. A number of mechanisms could be responsible for his increased sensitivity to chemicals following exposure to fluconazole/ketoconazole, including inhibition of P450 and other detoxification enzymes, acetaldehyde buildup, and neurogenic sensitization.\n[The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice - 2016 Year in Review.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28143692)\nSchatz, Michael; Sicherer, Scott H; Zeiger, Robert S\nAs editors, we concluded that it would be helpful to our readers to write a Year in Review article that highlights the Review, Original, and Clinical Communication articles published in 2016 in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice. We summarized articles on the topics of asthma, rhinitis/rhinosinusitis, food allergy, anaphylaxis, drug allergy, urticarial/angioedema, eosinophilic disorders, and immunodeficiency. Within each topic, epidemiologic findings are presented, relevant aspects of prevention are described, and diagnostic and therapeutic advances are enumerated. Diagnostic tools described include history, skin tests, and in vitro tests. Treatments discussed include behavioral therapy, allergen avoidance therapy, positive and negative effects of pharmacologic therapy, and various forms of immunologic and desensitization management. We hope this review will help you, our readers, consolidate and use this extensive and practical knowledge for the benefit of your patients.

In the United States more than 250 cases of sulfite-related adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, asthmatic attacks, urticaria and angioedema, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, seizures and death, have been reported, including 6 deaths allegedly associated with restaurant food containing sulfites. In Canada 10 sulfite-related adverse reactions have been documented, and 1 death suspected to be sulfite-related has occurred. The exact mechanism of sulfite-induced reactions is unknown. Practising physicians should be aware of the clinical manifestations of sulfite-related adverse reactions as well as which foods and pharmaceuticals contain sulfites. Cases should be reported to health officials and proper advice given to the victims to prevent further exposure to sulfites. The food industry, including beer and wine manufacturers, and the pharmaceutical industry should consider using alternative preservatives. In the interim, they should list any sulfites in their products.

ABSTRACT: The problem of formation of elliptical galaxies via dissipationless collapse is studied using a large set of numerical simulations. It is shown that dissipationless collapses from cold initial conditions, where the total initial kinetic energy is less than 5% ofthe initial potential energy, lead to relaxed triaxial systems ery similar to real elliptical galaxies ii projected shape and density profiles. The triaxial shape is due to the of a dynamical instability that appears on systems dominated by radial orbits, while final density profile is due to violent relaxation that tends to produce a unique distribution iii space. These two phenomena erase memory of the initial prodtice a convergent evolution toward realistic systems, thus making unnecessary use o[special initial conditions (other\n[Revision curricular a partir de un analisis comparativo de las discrepancias en los curriculos de una escuela de optometria en Puerto Rico con las competencias requeridas para las agencias de revalida y acreditacion 2004](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PhDT.......105R) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html)\nRivera Pacheco, Andres\nEl proposito de esta investigacion, un estudio cualitativo de caso, fue comparar y contrastar el curriculo vigente de la Escuela de Optometria de la UIAPR con las competencias y estandares requeridos por las agencias de acreditacion y de revalida. Con este proposito, decidimos realizar una revision y un analisis de documentos: el prontuario de cada uno de los cursos de los curriculos implantados en el 1993 y en el 2001; las competencias y estandares establecidos por las agencias de revalida y de acreditacion; y las estadisticas en las que se analiza el porcentaje de estudiantes que aprueban cada una de las partes de los examenes de revalida entre el 1998 al 2003. Se realizaron entrevistas dirigidas para dar apoyo y complementar la revision y el analisis de estos documentos. Los participantes de las entrevistas fueron tres estudiantes de la clase de optometria del 2004 (ultima clase del curriculo del 1993); tres estudiantes de la clase de optometria del 2005 (primera clase graduanda del curriculo vigente) y tres profesores y/o directores de los Departamentos de Ciencias Basicas, Ciencias Clinicas y Cuidado al Paciente. Esta investigacion se enmarco en el modelo de evaluacion curricular de discrepancia de Malcolm Provus y en el modelo de desarrollo basado en competencias. Uno de los hallazgos mas importantes del estudio es que los cambios que se implantaron al curriculo del 2001 no han logrado que los estudiantes mejoren su ejecucion en los examenes de revalida. Por otro lado, se encontro que el curriculo vigente atiende completamente los estandares de la practica de Optometria, pero no las competencias. Esta informacion fue validada mediante el uso de una tabla de cotejo para el analisis de los cursos y de la informacion obtenida de las entrevistas. El estudio determina y concluye que existen discrepancias entre los prontuarios de los cursos del curriculo y las competencias requeridas por la agencia de revalida.

La informacion sobre los tipos de fallas mostrados en el mapa es igual que en las fuentes originales. Los poligonos geologicos fueron atribuidos por edad, litologia y nombre de la unidad siguiendo el Codigo geologico de Venezuela. Se incorporaron revisiones significativas de la geologia de la Cordillera de la Costa a partir de las nuevas hojas integradas a escala 1:25.000. Toda esta informacion geologico-estructural se sobrepuso a una imagen de relieve sombreado, producida por el procesamiento de los datos de radar interferometrico con 90 m (3 arcosegundos) de resolucion espacial obtenidos por la mision topografica de radar del transbordador espacial (SRTM). Las areas de la base de datos del SRTM carentes de informacion fueron llenadas por medio de la interpolacion de los datos de las celdas adyacentes. Para producir la imagen de relieve sombreado se uso una direccion de iluminacion de 315 deg con un angulo de 65 deg sobre el horizonte. La proyeccion usada en el mapa es conica equidistante, con latitudes de 4 y 9 deg norte como paralelos estandar y una longitud de 66 deg al oeste como meridiano central. Los datos en el mapa proceden primordialment de hojas a escala 1:500.000 y el producto esta preparado para una impresion optima en escala 1:750.000. Los usuarios pueden obtener ampliaciones mayores, sin embargo no se garantiza la precision del mapa a escalas mas detalladas. Especialmente en la region de Guayana, al sobreponer los mapas geologicos sobre la reciente imagen SRTM, se notan grandes discrepancias no sistematicas tanto en contactos como en fallas.

The current study investigated how complex relationships among drug use and CSA may contribute to unprotected sexual occasions (USO). A Generalized Linear Mixed Model was used to examine the interaction between current cocaine/stimulants and opioid use and CSA on number of USOs in a sample of 214 sexually active women in outpatient methadone maintenance treatment. For women with CSA, an increase in days of cocaine/stimulant use was associated with a significant increase in USOs. In contrast, an increase in days of opiate use was associated with a significant decrease in USOs. For the group of women who did not report CSA, there was a significant increase in USOs with increased opiate use. Findings indicate that CSA is related to unprotected sexual occasions depending on drug type and severity of use. Women with CSA using cocaine are at particularly high risk for having unprotected sex and should be specifically targeted for HIV prevention interventions.\n[76 FR 20392 - Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated; Notice of Filing and...](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-04-12/pdf/2011-8622.pdf) [Federal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=FR)\n2011-04-12\n..., SMH, SNDK, SPLS, SPXU, SPY, SSO, SYMC, TBT, T, TLT, TNA,TSM, TWM, TXN, TZA, UCO, USO, UWM, UYG, VALE..., S, SH, SLV, SPF, SPXU, SPY, SSO, TBT, TLT, TWM, TZA, UCO, USO, UWM, VXX, XLI, XLP.

P.; Samain, E.; Tourain, C.; Auriol, A.; Guillemot, P.\n2016-12-01\nThe main applications for DORIS are precise orbit determination, and precise Geodesy. Onboard Jason-2 for instance, the DORIS tracking component is the French contribution to the precise orbit determination capability, a key capability for altimetry product scientific result accuracy. T2L2 is a time transfer technique based on the propagation of light pulses for synchronization between two clocks. Hosting T2L2 on-board Jason-2 was to allow for very fine DORIS USO (Ultra-Stable Oscillator) frequency monitoring, and for this purpose T2L2 was connected to the DORIS USO. Thanks to the continuous tracking of T2L2/Jason-2 by the Laser Ranging network it is possible to monitor the USO for several days, weeks, and even much longer, and thus to also compare with the DIODE (the DORIS on-board orbit determination software) frequency bias estimates. The DORIS USO frequency biases estimate comparison between two independent systems, T2L2 and DIODE, can be of benefit to both, allowing the accuracies of both systems to be better understood, and for improvements to be made to both systems. Such comparison is the central topic of the present paper. T2L2 monitors the DORIS on-board USO frequency with an accuracy of much better than 10-12 which is the specification for the Doppler instrumentation. The paper investigates the limits of the DORIS-DIODE frequency bias estimates using T2L2, showing that USO frequency compliance accuracy of 10-12 has been reached.\n[\"Estudio tribologico de aceros para moldes.

The material selection for mould manufacturing, its composition and heat treatment, the hardening procedures and machining and finishing processes determine the service performance and life of the mould. In the first part of the present study, the relationship between the hardness and microstructure and the wear resistance of mould steels from large blocks has been studied by pin-on-disc tests, studying the main wear mechanisms. In order to determine the surface damage on mould steels under real injection conditions, different commercial steels have been studied by measuring the variation of surface roughness with the number of injected pieces with different reinforcement percentages and different mould geometries, by using optical profilometry and scanning electron microscopy techniques. It was important to determine the variation of surface roughness of the moulded pieces with the number of injection operations. The materials used were polybutyleneterephthalate pure and reinforced with either 20% or 50% glass fibre. For the different mould designs, the evolution of the glass fibre orientation with injection flow has been determined by image analysis and related to roughness changes and surface damage, both of the composite parts and of the mould steel surface. Finally, the abrasion resistance of the composite parts has been studied by scratch tests as a function of the number of injected parts and of the scratch direction with respect to injection flow and glass fibre orientation. Los materiales para moldes de inyeccion de polimeros y materiales compuestos representan un sector economicamente muy relevante debido al gran aumento del numero de componentes fabricados a partir de materiales polimericos obtenidos mediante moldeo por inyeccion.

This would enable a central production facility to maintain the relevant mother stocks and large colonies to supply eggs to satellite centers that would mass produce only males for irradiation and release. In order to achieve this, the survival of medfly embryos of different ages was assessed after storage at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 deg. C in water for different periods of time. Survival was affected by allmore \u00bb 3 variables, i.e., embryo age, water temperature, and length of storage. Storage of embryos at any temperature for 120 h resulted in almost no survival. Controlling the age of the embryo at the time of the temperature treatment is crucial for the success of this procedure. Embryos collected between 0 to 12 h after oviposition and pre-incubated at 25 deg. C for 12 h provide a suitable 72 h window for shipment when maintained between 10 to 15 deg. C. Under these conditions, no significant reductions in survival during all the developmental stages were observed.

Several behavioral factors such as early detection and dietary practices could help decrease morbidity and mortality associated with breast cancer in this population. Unfortunately, there are few data regarding the efficacy of health-related interventions for young Latino women. Mujeres Felices por ser Saludables is a randomized intervention project designed to assess breast cancer risk reduction behavior among Latino women ages 20-40 years. The primary objectives of the project were to determine whether an 8-month integrated dietary/breast health intervention could lead to a greater reduction in dietary fat, increase in dietary fiber, increase in the frequency and proficiency of breast self examination (BSE), and reduction in anxiety related to BSE compared to controls. Herein we describe the overall design of the project and present baseline characteristics of the 256 randomized women. Our results suggest that the average daily intake of dietary fat (percentage of total energy) was slightly below 30% (percentage of total energy) among the women randomized. While over half of these women reported that they practice BSE, and few reported anxiety related to BSE, less than 27% of women were proficient in the recommended BSE technique. There are few data on the dietary and breast health behaviors of young low-acculturated Latino women. This study documents the feasibility of recruiting, randomizing, and obtaining both baseline dietary and breast health data on this unique and underserved population.\n[Substance Use, Depression and Sociodemographic Determinants of HIV Sexual Risk Behavior in Outpatient Substance Abuse Treatment Patients.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26501786)\nTross, Susan; Feaster, Daniel J; Thorens, Gabriel; Duan, Rui; Gomez, Zoilyn; Pavlicova, Martina; Hu, Mei Chen; Kyle, Tiffany; Erickson, Sarah; Spector, Anya; Haynes, Louise; Metsch, Lisa R\n2015-01-01\nThe NIDA Clinical Trials Network trial of rapid HIV testing/counseling in 1281 patients was a unique opportunity to examine relationships among substance use, depressive symptoms, and sex risk behavior. Past 6-month substance use; substance use severity (Drug Abuse Screening Test - 10); depressive symptoms (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology); and three types of sex risk behavior (unprotected sex occasions [USOs] with primary partners; USOs with nonprimary partners; and USOs while high/drunk) were assessed. Zero-inflated negative binomial analyses provided: probability and rate of sex risk behavior (in risk behavior subsample). Levels of sexual risk behavior were high, while variable across the three types of sex risk behaviors. Among the patients, 50.4% had engaged in USOs with primary partners, 42% in sex while drunk or high, and 23.8% in USOs with nonprimary partners. Similar factors were significantly associated with all three types of sex risk behaviors. For all types, problem drinking, cocaine use, and substance use severity had an exacerbating effect. Older age was associated with lower risk behavior; other relationship categories (eg, married, separated/divorced, cohabitating) were associated with greater risk behavior than was single status. Depressive symptoms were associated with decreased likelihood of USOs with a primary partner. Sexual risk behavior is common among individuals in outpatient substance abuse treatment. Results highlight problem drinking (eg, up to three-fold) and cocaine (eg, up to twice) in increasing sex risk behavior. They demonstrate the utility of distinguishing between partner types and presence/absence of alcohol/drugs during sex. Findings argue for the need to integrate sex risk reduction into drug treatment.\n[Relaci\u00f3n masa-radio para estrellas enanas blancas y la interpretaci\u00f3n de recientes mediciones hechas por Hipparcos](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998BAAA...42...22P) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html)\nPanei, J.

We aimed to study the relationship between genetic variants influencing the activity of these enzymes and transporters with galantamine steady state plasma concentrations. In this naturalistic cross-sectional study, 27 older patients treated with galantamine were included. The patients were genotyped for common polymorphisms in CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, POR, and ABCB1, and galantamine steady state plasma concentrations were determined. The CYP2D6 genotype seemed to be an important determinant of galantamine pharmacokinetics, with CYP2D6 poor metabolizers presenting 45% and 61% higher dose-adjusted galantamine plasma concentrations than heterozygous and homozygous CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (median 2.9 versus 2.0 ng/mL \u00b7 mg, P = 0.025, and 1.8 ng/mL \u00b7 mg, P = 0.004), respectively.

However, there are still several open questions regarding its use. In some aspects medical literature is controversial. The points of disagreement among experts include questions such as: Which patients should receive TXA in trauma? Should treatment be performed in the pre-hospital environment? Is there any need for laboratory parameters before starting TXA treatment? What is the drug safety profile? The main issue on which there is still no basis in literature is: What is the indication for treatment within massive transfusion protocols? Answer the questions proposed based on critical evaluation of the evidence gathered so far and carry out a study of cost-effectiveness of TXA use in trauma adapted to the Brazilian reality. A literature review was performed through searching Pubmed.com, Embase and Cab Abstract by headings \"tranexamic AND trauma\", in all languages, yielding 426 articles. Manuscripts reporting on TXA utilization for elective procedures were excluded, remaining 79 articles. Fifty-five articles were selected, and critically evaluated in order to answer study questions. The evaluation of cost effectiveness was performed using CRASH-2 trial data and Brazilian official population data. TXA is effective and efficient, and should be administered to a wide range of patients, including those with indication evaluated in research protocols and current indication criteria for TXA should be expanded. As for the cost-effectiveness, the TXA proved to be cost-effective with an average cost of R$ 61.35 (currently US$16) per year of life saved. The use of TXA in trauma setting seems to be effective, efficient and cost-effective in the various groups of polytrauma patients. Its use in massive transfusion protocols should be the subject of further investigations.

Celiac disease occurs in around 1% of the general population and WA in around 1% of all children. We report 2 patients with celiac disease and a gluten-free diet who developed WA consistent in anaphylaxis and an eyelid angioedema, respectively, through accidental wheat exposure. A serum study and an intestinal biopsy confirmed celiac disease. Both patients were studied with a skin prick test and serum-specific IgE, with a diagnosis of WA. In patients with celiac disease, the trace amounts of cereals present in gluten-free food could act as a sensitization factor, and probably patients with persistent symptoms (despite a gluten-free diet) are experiencing WA symptoms rather than celiac disease symptoms. The number of patients diagnosed with celiac disease has increased in the recent decades: the association between celiac disease and WA, exceedingly rare to date, could increase as well, prompting special attention to the possibility of inadvertent intake of cereals. \u00a9 2018 S.

Although several groups have reported a gastrointestinal Anisakis allergy among people in Spain and Japan, our report is the first to summarize the clinical features of 10 Anisakis allergy cases in Korea. We enrolled 10 Korean patients (6 men and 4 women) who complained of aggravated allergic symptoms after ingesting raw fish or seafood. Sensitization to Anisakis was confirmed by detecting serum specific IgE to Anisakis simplex. The most common manifestation of anisakiasis was urticaria (100%), followed by abdominal pain (30%) and anaphylaxis (30%). All patients presenting with these symptoms also exhibited high serum specific IgE (0.45 to 100 kU/L) to A. simplex. Nine patients (90%) exhibited atopy and increased total serum IgE levels. The fish species suspected of carrying the Anisakis parasite were flatfish (40%), congers (40%), squid (30%), whelk (10%), and tuna (10%). Anisakis simplex should be considered as a possible causative food allergen in adult patients presenting with urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis following the consumption of raw fish or seafood.

Castor bean allergy has been described mainly as an occupational inhalation allergy in laboratory workers, in persons working in oil processing mills or in agricultural industry. So far, only one case of anaphylactic reaction due to castor bean sensitization confirmed by specific IgE has been described in literature. A 30-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with severe angioedema followed by urticaria, hypotension and tachycardia. She recovered after treatment with antihistamines, corticosteroids, nebulized adrenaline and intravenous fluids. Food induced anaphylaxis was excluded by allergological investigations. After repeated thorough history, the patient mentioned having bitten into a castor bean just before the reaction. Cutaneous test (prick-to-prick) and specific IgE for castor bean were highly positive. We report the second case of a severe anaphylactic reaction to castor beans, confirmed by IgE testing, reported in the literature. It underlines the importance of a meticulous history in allergology and highlights the fact, that castor beans may cause potentially fatal anaphylaxis.\n[Formulation and Evaluation of Solid Lipid Nanoparticles of Ramipril](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3159275)\nEkambaram, P; Abdul, Hasan Sathali A\n2011-01-01\nSolid lipid nanoparticles are typically spherical with an average diameter between 1 and 1000 nm. It is an alternative carrier system to tradition colloidal carriers, such as, emulsions, liposomes, and polymeric micro and nanoparticles. Ramipril is an antihypertensive agent used in the treatment of hypertension. Its oral bioavailability is 28% and it is rapidly excreted through the renal route. This drug has many side effects such as, postural hypotension, hyperkalemia, and angioedema, when given as an immediate dosage form. To overcome the side effects and to increase the bioavailability of ramipril, solid lipid nanoparticles of ramipril are prepared by using lipids (glyceryl monostearate and glyceryl monooleate) with stabilizers (tween 80, poloxamer 188, and span 20). The prepared formulations have been evaluated for entrapment efficiency, drug content, in-vitro drug release, particle size analysis, scanning electron spectroscopy, Fourier transform-infrared studies, and stability. A formulation containing glyceryl monooleate, stabilized with span 20 as surfactant showed prolonged drug release, smaller particle size, and narrow particle size distribution, as compared to other formulations with different surfactants and lipids.

Although several groups have reported a gastrointestinal Anisakis allergy among people in Spain and Japan, our report is the first to summarize the clinical features of 10 Anisakis allergy cases in Korea. We enrolled 10 Korean patients (6 men and 4 women) who complained of aggravated allergic symptoms after ingesting raw fish or seafood. Sensitization to Anisakis was confirmed by detecting serum specific IgE to Anisakis simplex. The most common manifestation of anisakiasis was urticaria (100%), followed by abdominal pain (30%) and anaphylaxis (30%). All patients presenting with these symptoms also exhibited high serum specific IgE (0.45 to 100 kU/L) to A. simplex. Nine patients (90%) exhibited atopy and increased total serum IgE levels.

Surveillance of Adverse Events following Vaccination in the Community (SAEFVIC) is an enhanced passive surveillance system that collects, analyses and reports information about AEFI in Victoria, Australia. We describe the incidence, timing and type of potential IHR following vaccination in preschool children reported over an 8-year period. A total of 2110 AEFI were reported in 1620 children, of which 23.5% (496) were classified as potential IHR. Of these, 37.1% (184) were suspected to be IgE-mediated, (including anaphylaxis, angioedema and/or urticaria) and 83.5% (414) occurred within 15 minutes of vaccination. The incidence of potential IHR was 5.4 per 100,000 doses, with that of suspected IgE-mediated IHR being 2.0 per 100,000 doses. The incidence of anaphylaxis was extremely low (0.13 per 100,000 doses) and is consistent with other published studies. Potential IHR following immunization should be reported to appropriate local pharmacovigilance systems and patients reviewed by specialists able to evaluate, investigate and manage future vaccinations.\n[The Design and Development of a Potent and Selective Novel Diprolyl Derivative That Binds to the N-Domain of Angiotensin-I Converting Enzyme.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206036)\nFienberg, Stephen; Cozier, Gyles E; Acharya, K Ravi; Chibale, Kelly; Sturrock, Edward D\n2018-01-11\nAngiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metalloprotease consisting of two catalytic domains (N- and C-). Most clinical ACE inhibitor(s) (ACEi) have been shown to inhibit both domains nonselectively, resulting in adverse effects such as cough and angioedema. Selectively inhibiting the individual domains is likely to reduce these effects and potentially treat fibrosis in addition to hypertension. ACEi from the GVK Biosciences database were inspected for possible N-domain selective binding patterns. From this set, a diprolyl chemical series was modeled using docking simulations. The series was expanded based on key target interactions involving residues known to impart N-domain selectivity. In total, seven diprolyl compounds were synthesized and tested for N-domain selective ACE inhibition. One compound with an aspartic acid in the P 2 position (compound 16) displayed potent inhibition (K i = 11.45 nM) and was 84-fold more selective toward the N-domain. A high-resolution crystal structure of compound 16 in complex with the N-domain revealed the molecular basis for the observed selectivity.\nCamporro, Fernando Astur; Gutierrez Magaldi, Ignacio; Bulacio, Exequiel\n2017-09-08\nIntroducci\u00f3n: El tabaquismo es la primera causa evitable de muerte en el mundo. El cigarrillo electr\u00f3nico (CE), es un dispositivo que simula a los cigarrillos convencionales y permite inhalar nicotina y otras sustancias de forma vaporizada, sin combusti\u00f3n de tabaco. Su conocimiento por parte de la poblaci\u00f3n general, as\u00ed como su comercializaci\u00f3n y consumo viene en constante aumento. Es utilizado en todo el mundo con el objetivo de disminuir el consumo de tabaco, lograr su abandono o poder utilizarlo en lugares p\u00fablicos donde el consumo de cigarrillos convencionales est\u00e1 prohibido. Efectos nocivos sobre la salud: Su utilizaci\u00f3n se ha asociado a neumon\u00eda lipoidea e irritaci\u00f3n de la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea superior y toxicidad por nicotina. Presenta sustancias cancer\u00edgenas como nitrosaminas, formaldeido y metales como el niquel, cromo y plomo. Aumenta la resistencia de la v\u00eda a\u00e9rea, efecto que es similar al que se produce despu\u00e9s de la inhalaci\u00f3n del humo del tabaco. Eficacia para dejar de fumar: No hay hasta el momento trabajos que demuestren con poder estad\u00edstico y buena metodolog\u00eda que este producto sea eficaz para dejar de fumar. Conclusiones: De acuerdo a la evidencia disponible, no podemos descartar que el uso del cigarrillo electr\u00f3nico no tenga riesgos para la salud.

Com o modelo de regress\u00e3o log\u00edstica m\u00faltipla, observou-se que, a cada ano de atua\u00e7\u00e3o do dirigente na educa\u00e7\u00e3o, a chance de a escola ter um programa aumentava em aproximadamente 4,0%. O fato de experimentar t\u00e9cnicas de ensino inovadoras tamb\u00e9m aumentou em cerca de seis vezes a chance de a escola desenvolver um programa de preven\u00e7\u00e3o ao uso de drogas. As dificuldades na implanta\u00e7\u00e3o dos programas foram mais presentes nas redes estadual e municipal, quando comparadas \u00e0 rede privada, destacando-se: a falta de material did\u00e1tico, a falta de dinheiro e as demandas concorrentes para ensino de outras disciplinas.

The purpose of this study was to examine gender differences in factors (age, race/ethnicity, education) that predict main-partner unprotected sexual occasions (USO) using the unique platform of two parallel NIDA National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network gender-specific safer sex intervention trials. Baseline assessments of male (N = 430) and female (N = 377) participants included demographic characteristics; past 3-month sexual activity; and a diagnostic assessment for alcohol, cocaine/stimulant, and opioid use disorders. Using mixed effects generalized linear modeling of the main outcome USO, two-way interactions of gender with age, race/ethnicity, and education were evaluated and adjusted by alcohol, cocaine/stimulant, or opioid use disorder. When adjusted for alcohol use disorder, the interaction of education and gender was significant. For men, a high school or greater education was significantly associated with more USO compared to men with less than high school. For women, greater than high school education was significantly associated with less USO compared to women with a high school education. None of the other interactions were significant when adjusted for cocaine/stimulant or opioid use disorder. Conclusions/Importance: This study demonstrates gender differences in the relationship of education, alcohol use disorder, and main-partner USO in individuals in substance abuse treatment. This underscores the importance of considering demographic and substance use factors in HIV sexual risk behavior and in crafting prevention messages for this population.\n[Degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol using combined approach based on ultrasound, ozone and catalyst.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27562908)\nBarik, Arati J; Gogate, Parag R\n2017-05-01\nThe present work investigates the application of ultrasound and ozone operated individually and in combination with catalyst (ZnO and CuO) for establishing the possible synergistic effects for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol. The dependency of extent of degradation on the operating parameters like temperature (over the range of 30-36\u00b0C), initial pH (3-9), catalyst as ZnO (loading of 0.025-0.15g/L) and CuO (loading of 0.02-0.1g/L) and initial concentration of 2,4-DCP (20-50ppm) has been established to maximize the efficacy of ultrasound (US) induced degradation. Using only US, the maximum degradation of 2,4-DCP obtained was 28.85% under optimized conditions of initial concentration as 20ppm, pH of 5 and temperature of 34\u00b0C. Study of effect of ozone flow rate for approach of only ozone revealed that maximum degradation was obtained at 400mg/h ozone flow rate. The combined approaches such as US+O 3 , US+ZnO, US+CuO, O 3 +ZnO, O 3 +CuO, US+O 3 +ZnO and US+O 3 +CuO have been subsequently investigated under optimized conditions and observed to be more efficient as compared to individual approaches. The maximum extent of degradation for the combined operation of US+O 3 (400mg/h)+ZnO (0.1g/L) and US+O 3 (400mg/h)+CuO (0.08g/L) has been obtained as 95.66% and 97.03% respectively. The degradation products of 2,4-DCP have been identified using GC-MS analysis and the toxicity analysis has also been performed based on the anti-microbial activity test (agar-well diffusion method) for the different treatment strategies. The present work has conclusively established that the combined approach of US+O 3 +CuO was the most efficient treatment scheme resulting in near complete degradation of 2,4-DCP with production of less toxic intermediates.

Astronomia na Sala de Aula: Por Qu\u00ea?](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010RELEA...9....7D) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html)\nDaros Gama, Leandro; Bagdonas Henrique, Alexandre\n2010-07-01\nThere are many discussions about the relevance of the topics covered in classes. One subject in particular is the focus of this essay: astronomy. In what sense and to what extent it would be worth to teach it in science or other kind of classes? In this paper we discuss some aspects of the advantages of dealing with this area of knowledge in schools, taking into account the epistemological and axiological dimensions of astronomy, in light of the vision of science as an intelligent dialogue with the world (Bachelard), in addition to the \"problematization\" knowledge of Paulo Freire. We propose that in fact the Astronomy does not need to be seen as just a new set of contents to be taught, but appears as a set of motivational contents for historical-philosophical discussions, and permit the discussion of concepts of other disciplines. Numerosas discusiones se est\u00e1n llevando a cabo acerca de la pertinencia de los temas tradicionalmente tratados en las clases. Uno de los temas, en particular, es el foco de este ensayo: la astronom\u00eda. \u00bfEn qu\u00e9 sentido y en qu\u00e9 medida ser\u00eda conveniente tratarla en clase, ya sea en clases de ciencias naturales, espec\u00edficamente en las de astronom\u00eda o asignaturas afines?

M\u00e9todo: Se revisaron en forma retrospectiva los controles en tomograf\u00eda axial computada (TAC) de 76 tornillos pediculares lumbares y sacros colocados por v\u00eda posterior, mediante un abordaje mediano convencional (n: 38) o por v\u00eda posterolateral transmuscular tipo Wiltse (n: 38). Se incluyeron fusiones lumbosacras cortas desde L3 a S1, en pacientes adultos, con patolog\u00eda degenerativa. Se excluyeron los tornillos con una brecha \u00f3sea >4 mm en cualquier direcci\u00f3n, los casos con instrumentaciones pediculares previas y aquellos con curvas en el plano coronal mayores de 20\u00b0. Resultados: Considerando la totalidad de los implantes, el \u00e1ngulo de convergencia fue de 23,3\u00b0 (+/- 15,82). La angulaci\u00f3n promedio, en el grupo AW, fue de 29,3\u00b0 (+/- 9,72). En el grupo AC, el grado de convergencia de los implantes fue de 17,2\u00b0 (+/- 10,58). Esta diferencia fue estad\u00edsticamente significativa (P < 0,0001). Para el grupo AW, el grado de convergencia seg\u00fan nivel fue el siguiente: L3: 31,2\u00b0 (+/- 1,9); L4: 31,4\u00b0 (+/- 2,76); L5: 31,1\u00b0 (+/- 5,62); S1: 24,2\u00b0 (+/- 12,16). El promedio del \u00e1ngulo del tornillo seg\u00fan nivel para el grupo AC fue: L3: 16\u00b0 (+/- 7,16); L4: 20,3\u00b0 (+/- 6,9) L5: 15,9\u00b0 (+/- 13,38); S1: 15,2\u00b0 (+/- 14,32). Los implantes del grupo AW tuvieron \u00e1ngulos significativamente m\u00e1s convergentes que el grupo AC en todos los segmentos explorados.

We studied the applicability of four common stomatal conductance models including Jarvis, Ball-Woodrow-Berry (BWB), Ball-Berry-Leuning (BBL) and unified stomatal optimization (USO) models based on summer maize leaf gas exchange data from a soil moisture consecutive decrease manipulation experiment. The results showed that the USO model performed best, followed by the BBL model, BWB model, and the Jarvis model performed worst under varying soil moisture conditions. The effects of soil moisture made a difference in the relative performance among the models. By introducing a water response function, the performance of the Jarvis, BWB, and USO models improved, which decreased the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) by 15.7%, 16.6% and 3.9%, respectively; however, the performance of the BBL model was negative, which increased the NRMSE by 5.3%. It was observed that the models of Jarvis, BWB, BBL and USO were applicable within different ranges of soil relative water content (i.e., 55%-65%, 56%-67%, 37%-79% and 37%-95%, respectively) based on the 95% confidence limits. Moreover, introducing a water response function, the applicability of the Jarvis and BWB models improved. The USO model performed best with or without introducing the water response function and was applicable under varying soil moisture conditions. Our results provide a basis for selecting appropriate stomatal conductance models under drought conditions. Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Thirty-two foods were tested by an epicutaneous method. Positive skin tests to food allergens were more frequent in children with allergy to grass pollen (59.8%) than in children with allergy to Dermatophagoides (9.4%). A considerably high frequency of positive reactions to tomato (39.2%), peanut (22,5%), green pea (13.7%), and wheat (11.7%) was observed in children with allergy to grass pollen. Positive skin tests to peanut closely correlated with positive RAST results and nasal provocation tests, whereas in children with skin test positivity to tomato a close correlation with nasal provocation tests but a 45% correlation with a positive RAST result were observed. RAST inhibition experiments were carried out, and the results may suggest the presence of cross-reacting IgE to grass pollen, tomato, and peanut antigens. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed in the light of histories of food hypersensitivity, urticaria-angioedema, and atopic dermatitis in children with allergy to grass pollen.\n[[Anaphylaxis caused by royal jelly].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7572543)\nRoger, A; Rubira, N; Nogueiras, C; Guspi, R; Baltasar, M; Cadahia, A\n1995-01-01\nRoyal jelly is the food on which are fed and which causes them to develop into queen bees. It is claimed to have rejuvenating virtues for human beings. This report describes a 15-year-old atopic woman who presented, 15 minutes after the intake of royal jelly, local angioedema, generalised urticaria, dysphonia and bronchospasm. She was given antihistaminics and corticoesteroids and responded well. The ingested product contains royal jelly, lactose and potassium sorbate. No anaphylactic reactions to lactose and sorbates have been described previously. Prick test to common food allergens hymenoptera venoms and pollens were negative. RAST to meletin was also negative. Blood eosinophils were 600 and total IgE 465. Non-commercial prepared specific IgE to royal jelly was positive (0.8 KU/l). Prick by prick was positive to 1/10 dilution, being negative in controls (undiluted). No oral provocation test was performed due to the risk of anaphylaxis. No reported cases of royal jelly allergy were founded in a review of the medical literature. Concluding, it is the first described case of IgE anaphylactic reaction due to royal jelly.\n[[Anaesthesic management of vaginal delivery in a parturient with C1 esterase deficiency].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19359129)\nLibert, N; Sch\u00e9rier, S; Dubost, C; Franck, L; Rouquette, I; Tortosa, J-C; Rousseau, J-M\n2009-04-01\nHereditary and acquired angioedema (HAE/AAE) are the clinical translation of a qualitative or a quantitative deficit of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 INH). The frequency and severity of clinical manifestations vary greatly, ranging from a moderate swelling of the extremities to obstruction of upper airway. Anaesthesiologists and intensivists must be prepared to manage acute manifestations of this disease in case of life-threatening laryngeal edema. Surgery, physical trauma and labour are classical triggers of the disease. The anaesthesiologists should be aware of the drugs used as prophylaxis and treatment of acute attacks when considering labour and caesarean section. Androgens are contraindicated during pregnancy. If prophylaxis is required, tranexamic acid may be used with caution. The safest obstetric approach appears to be to administer a predelivery infusion of C1 INH concentrate. It is important to avoid manipulation of the airway as much as possible by relying on regional techniques. We report the case of a patient suffering from an HAE discovered during pregnancy. The management included administration of C1 INH during labor and early epidural analgesia for pain relief. A short review of the pathophysiology and therapeutic options follows.\n[Food Allergy: Common Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26434966)\nPatel, Bhavisha Y; Volcheck, Gerald W\n2015-10-01\nFood allergy is a growing concern, and recognition of symptoms, knowledge of common food allergens, and management of reactions are important for patients and practitioners. Symptoms of a classic IgE-mediated food allergy vary in severity and can include any combination of laryngeal edema, wheezing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urticaria, angioedema, and hypotension. Many foods can induce an allergic reaction, but the most commonly implicated foods include cow's milk, egg, peanut, tree nut, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish. Milk and egg allergy generally develop and are outgrown in childhood. Peanut and tree nut allergy can occur during childhood or adulthood, are less likely to be outgrown, and tend to cause more fatal reactions. Given the possibility of life-threatening reactions, it is important to recognize the potential for cross-reactivity among food groups. Diagnosis of food allergy includes skin prick testing, specific serum IgE testing, and oral food challenges. Management is centered on avoidance of allergenic and cross-reacting foods and early recognition and immediate treatment of reactions. Treatment protocols to desensitize patients to food are currently under investigation. Copyright \u00a9 2015 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The most common foods implicated include cow milk, wheat, egg, soy, peanut, tree nuts such as walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, cashews, pecans, and pistachios, fish and shellfish. The majority of food allergies represent an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to specific proteins found in foods. Peanut allergy, in particular, is a significant food allergy responsible for the majority of patients with food-induced anaphylaxis. Even trace quantities to food proteins in the sensitized individual can lead to fatal reactions. There is often a rapid onset of symptoms after exposure, with prominent cutaneous findings of urticaria, angioedema, or diffuse nonspecific dermatitis. The majority of children outgrow allergies to milk, soy, egg, and wheat. However, allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, and seafood are usually lifelong conditions, as few outgrow it. Children with food allergies and their families should be knowledgeable of management strategies for the condition, including carrying and properly administering self-injectable epinephrine. New immunotherapeutic options are being investigated and appear promising. \u00a9 2013 The International Society of Dermatology.\n[Delayed immediate-type hypersensitivity to red meat and innards: current insights into a novel disease entity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26713635)\nFischer, J\u00f6rg; Biedermann, Tilo\n2016-01-01\nThe development of component-resolved diagnostics instead of whole extracts has brought about major advances in recent years. Particularly remarkable has been the identification of new disease entities based on the detection of IgE antibodies against specific individual components. In this context, delayed immediate-type hypersensitivity to red meat and innards plays a key role. This disorder is more common in German-speaking countries and likely still underdiagnosed. Affected individuals exhibit delayed type I reactions following the consumption of red meat or innards (responses to the latter are more rapid). All patients have IgE antibodies against the oligosaccharide galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose - alpha-gal. Those affected also have to avoid alpha-gal-containing drugs such as cetuximab or gelatin-containing colloidal solutions. Also referred to as alpha-gal syndrome, this condition is unique in that it is characterized by type I hypersensitivity to a sugar instead of a protein. Given that many patients have a history of recurrent episodes of acute urticaria or angioedema, dermatologists should be familiar with the alpha-gal syndrome. \u00a9 2015 Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft (DDG).

In Japan, children who suffered from allergic immediate-type reactions to JE vaccine had antigelatin IgE in their sera. However, the immunologic mechanism of allergic nonimmediate-type reactions that consist of cutaneous signs appearing several hours or more after JE vaccination has not been defined. Serum samples were taken from 28 children who showed allergic nonimmediate-type cutaneous reactions to JE vaccine. Furthermore, serum samples were taken from 10 children who showed allergic immediate-type reactions with cutaneous signs and/or respiratory symptoms to JE vaccine. We have defined an immediate-type reaction as one occurring within 1 h after vaccination. Of 10 children who showed immediate-type reactions, all had antigelatin IgE and IgG. Of 28 children who showed systemic nonimmediate-type reactions, one had antigelatin IgE and nine (32%) had antigelatin IgG. The child who had antigelatin IgE showed urticaria 2 h after JE vaccination. These results suggest that some children who showed allergic nonimmediate-type reactions to JE vaccine were sensitized to gelatin.\n[Mosquito bite anaphylaxis: immunotherapy with whole body extracts.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7719881)\nMcCormack, D R; Salata, K F; Hershey, J N; Carpenter, G B; Engler, R J\n1995-01-01\nAdverse reactions to mosquito bites have been recognized for some time. These usually consist of large local swellings and redness, generalized urticaria, angioedema and less easily definable responses such as nausea, dizziness, headaches, and lethargy. We report two patients who experienced systemic anaphylaxis from mosquito bites. Both were skin tested and given immunotherapy using whole body mosquito extracts. Skin testing using whole body mosquito extracts was positive to Aedes aegypti at 1/1,000 weight/volume (wt/vol) in one patient and to Aedes aegypti at 1/100,000 wt/vol, and Culex pipiens at 1/10,000 wt/vol in the other. Skin testing of ten volunteers without a history of adverse reactions to mosquito bites was negative. Immunotherapy using these extracts resulted in resolution of adverse reactions to mosquito bites in one patient and a decrease in reactions in the other. Immunotherapy with whole body mosquito extracts is a viable treatment option that can play a role in patients with mosquito bite-induced anaphylaxis. It may also result in severe side effects and one must determine the benefit versus risks for each individual patient.\n[[Acetylsalicylic acid and food additive intolerance in urticaria, bronchial asthma and rhinopathy].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7291963)\nW\u00fcthrich, B; Fabro, L\n1981-09-26\nAdverse reactions (urticaria, angio-edema, bronchoconstriction, purpura) to Aspirin (ASS) and food-and-drug additives such as the yellow dye tartrazine and the preservative benzoate are observed all over the world. Since the exact pathogenetic mechanisms of this condition is unknown, it is described as intolerance or pseudo-allergy and has been related to an imbalance of prostaglandin synthesis. Among 620 patients with urticaria, bronchial asthma or chronic rhinitis, oral provocation tests with ASS, tartrazine or benzoic acid revealed in 165 (26.6%) intolerance to ASS or additives. Frequency of intolerance to tartrazine varied between 6.1% in urticaria (n=308), 7.3% in asthma (n=96) and 14.5% in urticaria and asthma patients, while intolerance to benzoate varied from 2.5% in rhinitis (n=40) to 11.5% in asthma. More than two thirds of the intolerant patients were improved by an elimination diet and by the avoidance of \"aspirin-like\" drugs. More than one third of chronic urticaria patients became symptomfree. In Switzerland exact declaration of all food additives is urgently needed. Moreover, azo-dyes must no longer be used for colouring of drugs.\n[Severe adverse drug reaction following Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (Ovine) administration for copperhead snakebite.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25341425)\nLepak, Maryjoy R; Bochenek, Samantha H; Bush, Sean P\n2015-01-01\nTo present the case of a severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction to Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (Ovine) in a patient bitten by a copperhead snake. A 68-year-old man presented with progressive envenomation after receiving a copperhead snakebite on each hand. Crotalinae Fab antivenom was administered. While the initial and only dose was partially infusing, the patient developed an adverse drug reaction (ADR) of urticaria and hypotension, which resolved with cessation of the infusion, recurred with resumption of the infusion, and ultimately was completed with supportive care. An additional episode of hypotension, urticaria, and angioedema occurred shortly after antivenom therapy completion. Epinephrine was administered, resolving the reaction with complete patient recovery. The event received a Naranjo score of 10, indicating a definite ADR. Treating copperhead snakebites with antivenom is a matter of debate. Concern over adverse events and cost induce some physicians to manage copperhead bites without antivenom because they are generally milder in severity. As demonstrated in this case, severe ADR can occur with Crotalinae Fab antivenom, and its efficacy for copperhead envenoming needs to be better established via placebo-controlled, randomized trials. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2014.\n[Tone based command system for reception of very weak signals](http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20080008631) [NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp)\nBokulic, Robert Steven (Inventor); Jensen, James Robert (Inventor)\n2006-01-01\nThis disclosure presents a communication receiver system for spacecraft that includes an open loop receiver adapted to receive a communication signal.

Because breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the most common cause of cancer mortality in this population, combined interventions that address both early detection and dietary patterns could help reduce both morbidity and mortality associated with breast cancer in this underserved population. Mujeres Felices por ser Saludables was randomized intervention study designed to assess the efficacy of an 8-month combined dietary and breast health intervention to reduce fat and increase fiber intake as well as to increase the frequency and proficiency of breast self-examination (BSE) and reduce anxiety related to BSE among Latinas. Blocked randomization in blocks of 6 was used to randomize 256 20- to 40-year-old Latinas to the intervention (n = 127) or control group (n = 129). The intervention group attended an 8-month multicomponent education program designed specifically for low-acculturated Latinas. The control group received mailed health education material on a schedule comparable to the intervention. A total of 195 women (76.2%) completed both the baseline and 8-month follow-up interviews. The intervention and control groups were similar on baseline sociodemographic characteristics. At the 8-month follow up, the intervention group reported lower dietary fat (P < .001) and higher fiber intake (p = .06); a higher proportion reported practicing BSE at the recommended interval (p < .001) and showed improved BSE proficiency (p < .001) compared to the control group. BSE-related anxiety was low for both groups at baseline, and no difference in reduction was observed.

Material y m\u00e9todos Estudio transversal en una muestra cl\u00ednica de d\u00edadas paciente/ informador, 330 sujetos con sospecha de DC o demencia (DEM) y 71 controles. Se ha evaluado la consistencia interna (\u03b1 de Cronbach) y la validez (correlaciones parciales con estadio GDS, Fototest e \u00edndice funcional [IF]). La UD se ha evaluado para no DC vs DC (GDS 3\u20134) por medio del \u00e1rea bajo la curva ROC (aROC) y se ha considerado mejor punto de corte aquel que hac\u00eda m\u00e1ximo el \u00edndice de Youden. Resultados En la muestra, 105 no ten\u00edan DC, 99 ten\u00edan DC sin DEM y 203 DEM. La consistencia interna es alta (\u03b1 0,90, IC del 95%, 0,89\u20130,92), al igual que las correlaciones con GDS (r = 0,72, p < 0,001), Fototest (r = \u22120,61, p < 0,001) e IF (r = 0,59, p < 0,001). El aROC del AD8 es 0,90 (IC del 95%, 0,86\u20130,93), sin diferencia significativa con la del Fototest (aROC 0,93, IC del 95%, 0,89\u20130,96); el mejor punto de corte es 3/4 con sensibilidad de 0,93 (IC del 95%, 0,88\u20130,96), especificidad de 0,81 (IC del 95%, 0,72\u20130,88) y el 88,8% de las clasificaciones correctas. El uso conjunto de AD8 y Fototest mejora de forma significativa la UD de ambos (aROC 0,96, IC del 95%, 0,93\u20130,98, p < 0,05). Conclusiones La versi\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola del AD8 conserva las cualidades psicom\u00e9tricas y la UD de la versi\u00f3n original; su uso combinado con el Fototest mejora de forma significativa la UD de ambos.

To address the paucity of data about the actual degree of PS, this study aimed to: 1) evaluate and compare PS across three healthcare programs (Physical Therapy [PT], Communication Disorders [CD], and Nutrition Sciences [NS]) in one university; 2) evaluate changes in PS across study years; 3) identify the contribution of academic- and socio-demographic-related variables to PS; and 4) determine whether the Israeli students' PS levels differ from those of their peers in other countries. A cross-sectional survey was performed among all undergraduate PT, CD, and NS students from one university. Data were collected using anonymous questionnaires. Instruments included the Perceived Stress Scale 10 (PSS) and the Undergraduate Sources of Stress (USOS). ANOVA was used to evaluate the differences between the three programs, and regression analysis to evaluate the contribution of socio-demographic factors to PS and USOS. A total of 312 students (PT--154; CD--92; NS--66) participated in the study. Mean PSS (range: 13.5-13.6) was similar in the three programs. The USOS academic factor was the most reported source of stress in all programs. Most socio-demographic variables were not related to either PS or USOS. Students from PT, CD, and NS programs perceived similar levels of stress. The academic factor was perceived as the most important source of stress by students from the three departments, despite differences in the academic educational programs. Further studies are needed to generalize these results and enable a comparison between healthcare students and other students' stress perceptions.\n[Compila\u00e7\u00e3o de dados at\u00f4micos e moleculares do UV ao IV pr\u00f3ximo para uso em s\u00edntese espectral](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003BASBr..23...98C) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html)\nCoelho, P.; Barbuy, B.; Melendez, J.; Allen, D.

As such, sometimes scientific efforts follow major streams and overlook some epidemiologically prevalent conditions that thus become underestimated by the research community. For this reason, we welcome the present issue of Clinical Reviews in Allergy and Immunology that is dedicated to uncommon themes in clinical immunology and allergy. First, comprehensive discussions are provided for allergy phenomena of large potential impact in clinical practice such as reactions to cephalosporins or aspirin-induced asthma and in everyday life such as allergies to food additives or legumes. Further, the issue addresses other uncommon themes such as urticaria and angioedema, cercarial dermatitis, or late-onset inflammation to soft tissue fillers. Last, there will be discussion on transversal issues such as olfactory defects in autoimmunity, interleukin 1 beta pathway, and the search for new serological markers in chronic inflammation. As a result, we are convinced that this issue will be of help to clinicians involved in internal medicine as well as to allergists and clinical immunologists. More importantly, we are convinced that these discussions will be of interest also to basic scientists for the numerous translational implications.\n[Fish induced anaphylactic reaction: report of one case.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9684528)\nLin, H Y; Shyur, S D; Fu, J L; Lai, Y C; Lin, J S\n1998-01-01\nIn the past 2 years, a 4 year-old boy has had an anaphylactic reaction whenever he contacted food prepared with fish.

Many fish preparations caused these episodes including several different kinds of fish (cod, tuna, salmon, trout, eel...), fish soup, chopsticks contaminated with fish preparations and canned fish. Elevated levels of total serum IgE (224 IU/ml) and specific IgE for cod (93.1 IU/ml), tuna (> 100 IU/ml), salmon (> 100 IU/ml), trout (64.4 IU/ml), mackerel (41.2 IU/ml) and eel (28.1 IU/ml) were found by the Pharmacia CAP system RAST FEIA in our allergy clinic. A skin prick test for mixed fish extracts (contain flounder, cod and halibut) was positive. A fish challenge test for cod, tuna, salmon, trout and eel all showed anaphylactic reactions. His allergic symptoms stabilized gradually after strictly avoiding ingestion of fish and using drug treatment. He also had a similar anaphylactic reaction to frogs. The best treatment for fish allergy is avoidance. Avoidance of fish may need to include both ingestion and inhalation of cooking vapors.\n[[Anaphylactic shock revealing anisakiasis].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12355992)\nMagnaval, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois; Berry, Antoine; Nadrigny, Michel\n2002-09-07\nThe manifestations of anisakiasis are essentially digestive pain, nausea or transit disorders. When it is initially asymptomatic, it is later revealed by a major complication, which is occlusion on an eosinophilic granuloma of the ileum. Over the past 5 years, the international literature has reported allergic manifestations related to this helminthozoonose, such as urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm and occasionally anaphylactic shock. A 60 year-old man presented with an anaphylactic shock and diarrhea. One month later, he exhibited persisting asthenia, cough and intermittant pruriginous rashes. Blood hypereosinophilia was borderline and total IgE was clearly increased. The initial event was retrospectively labeled \"histaminic shock following ingestion of tuna fish\". The discovery of highly positive anisakiasis serology, conducted simultaneously in 2 different laboratories, corrected the diagnosis. The patient was treated with albendazole (10 mg/kg/day for 7 days) with excellent results on the clinical and biological symptomatology. With the occurrence of an allergic reaction, whether major or minor, a notion of ingestion of fresh fish must be searched for and, if positive, an immunodiagnosis of anisakiasis must be requested. Any seriological positivity should be controled by gastro-duodenal endoscopy. If the search for larvae is negative, we recommend anthelminthic treatment as a precaution.\n[T cell activity in successful treatment of chronic urticaria with omalizumab](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3159131)\n2011-01-01\nOmalizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody has the potential to alter allergen processing. Recently, it has been postulated the assessment of PHA-stimulated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activity as maker of CD4+ T cells activity in peripheral blood cells. We present the case report of a 35-year-old woman with a history of chronic idiopathic urticaria and angioedema of 8 years of development with poor response to treatment. The patient was partially controlled with cyclosporine at doses of 100 mg/12 h. However, she was still developing hives daily. Finally treatment with omalizumab was started at dose of 300 mg every 2 weeks. The patient experienced a decrease in urticarial lesions 2 days after starting therapy. We also evaluated the effects of omalizumab therapy on the activity of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from the patient, in order to determine the potential modification of anti-IgE therapy on the process of antigen presentation-recognition. Activity of CD4+ cells by ATP release was clearly increased demonstrating an enlarged CD4 activity. Omalizumab may be useful in the treatment of severe chronic urticaria. ATP activity of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells might be a non-subjective method to assess Omalizumab activity.

It has a notable influence on the patients' quality of life. Regulation of the immune system is one of the important roles of the gut microbiota. The effect of dysbiosis considering some members of gut microbiota in patients with chronic urticaria has been demonstrated in our previous study. Comparing the frequency and bacterial load of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides between patients with chronic urticaria and healthy controls. 20 patients with chronic urticaria and 20 age and sex matched healthy individuals were included in the present study. Stool samples were analyzed for determining the frequency and bacterial load of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides genera. There were no significant differences among the frequencies of detectable Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, or Bacteroides in stool samples of patients with chronic urticaria and healthy controls. The relative amounts of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were significantly higher in fecal samples from controls compared to patients with chronic urticaria (P = 0.038 and 0.039, respectively). It is the first study on the implication of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides genera as gut microbiota members in patients with chronic urticaria. Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional horse serum-based crotalid antivenom used in the United States (Antivenin [Crotalidae] polyvalent) can lead to both immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab (ovine) (CroFab; FabAV) has recently been approved for use in the United States. Experience from premarketing trials of this product and in the administration of other types of Fab, such as in digoxin poisoning, has demonstrated these fragments to be safe and effective, with a low incidence of sequella; however, allergic reactions can occur when any animal-protein derivatives are administered to human subjects. We report in detail the nature and course of allergic reactions that occurred in 4 patients treated with FabAV. Cases of anaphylaxis, acute urticaria, angioedema, and delayed serum sickness are described. All reactions were easily treated with some combination of antihistamines, epinephrine, and steroids, with prompt resolution of signs and symptoms enabling further dosing of antivenom as required. Several of these cases may have resulted from batches of antivenom contaminated with Fc fragments. The overall incidence of immediate and delayed allergic reactions to this product appears so far to be lower than that reported with conventional whole-immunoglobulin G (IgG) antivenom, but postmarketing surveillance is warranted.\n[Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) intervertebral cage as a cause of chronic systemic allergy: a case report.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25862511)\nMaldonado-Naranjo, Andres L; Healy, Andrew T; Kalfas, Iain H\n2015-07-01\nPolyetheretherketone (PEEK) is an organic polymer thermoplastic with strong mechanical and chemical resistance properties. It has been used in industry to fabricate items for demanding applications such as bearings, piston parts, compressor plate valves, and cable insulation. Since the early 1980s, polyetheretherketone polymers have been increasingly used in orthopedic and spinal surgery applications. Numerous studies and years of clinical experience have confirmed the biocompatibility of this material. The purpose of the study was to report a case of chronic systemic allergy after anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) and implantation of an intervertebral PEEK cage, with resolution of symptoms after removal of PEEK cage. This study is a case report with clinical evidence for allergy to PEEK. The methods involve clinical findings and review of current literature. After ACDF and implantation of an intervertebral PEEK cage, the patient had developed an angioedema-like picture marked by severe redness, itching, swelling of his tongue, and skin thickening. A skin patch test was positive for PEEK. Removal of the implant resulted in the resolution of his allergy symptoms shortly after surgery. Tissue reactions to PEEK are extremely rare. Herein, we present the first report of a chronic allergic response to interbody PEEK material. Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To examine the clinical features of acne patients with solid facial edema, and to give an overview on the outcome of previous topical and systemic treatments in the cases so far published. We report two cases from Switzerland, both young men with initially papulopustular acne resistant to topical retinoids. Both cases responded to oral isotretinoin, in one case combined with oral steroids. Our cases show a strikingly similar clinical appearance to the cases described by Connelly and Winkelmann in 1985 (Connelly MG, Winkelmann RK. Solid facial edema as a complication of acne vulgaris. Arch Dermatol. 1985;121(1):87), as well as to cases of Morbihan's disease that occurs as a rare complication of rosacea. Even 30 years after, the cause of the edema remains unknown. In two of the original four cases, a potential triggering factor was identified such as facial trauma or insect bites; however, our two patients did not report such occurrencies. The rare cases of solid facial edema in both acne and rosacea might hold the key to understanding the specific inflammatory pattern that creates both persisting inflammation and disturbed fluid homeostasis which can occur as a slightly different presentation in dermatomyositis, angioedema, Heerfordt's syndrome and other conditions.\n[[Acute blue urticaria following subcutaneous injection of patent blue dye].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26372548)\nHamelin, A; Vial-Dupuy, A; Lebrun-Vignes, B; Franc\u00e8s, C; Soria, A; Barete, S\n2015-11-01\nPatent blue (PB) is a lymphatic vessel dye commonly used in France for sentinel lymph node detection in breast cancer, and less frequently in melanoma, and which may induce hypersensitivity reactions. We report a case of acute blue urticaria occurring within minutes of PB injection. Ten minutes after PB injection for sentinel lymph node detection during breast cancer surgery, a 49-year-old woman developed generalised acute blue urticaria and eyelid angioedema without bronchospasm or haemodynamic disturbance, but requiring discontinuation of surgery. Skin testing using PB and the anaesthetics given were run 6 weeks after the episode and confirmed PB allergy. PB was formally contra-indicated. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to PB have been reported for between 0.24 and 2.2% of procedures. Such reactions are on occasion severe, chiefly involving anaphylactic shock. Two mechanisms are probably associated: non-specific histamine release and/or an IgE-mediated mechanism. Skin tests are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PB allergy. Blue acute urticaria is one of the clinical manifestations of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to patent blue dye. Skin tests must be performed 6 weeks after the reaction in order to confirm the diagnosis and formally contra-indicate this substance. Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The program sampled the Italian population and was termed 'Monitoring of the Adverse Effects in Pediatric population' (MEAP). Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were collected for individuals aged 0 - 17 years treated in hospitals and territorial health services in Lombardy, Tuscany, Apulia and Campania; located to gain an appropriate sampling of the population. ADRs were evaluated using the Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale (Naranjo) and analyzed with respect to time, age, sex, category of ADR, seriousness, suspected medicines, type of reporter and off-label use. We collected and analyzed reports from 3539 ADRs. Vaccines, antineoplastic and psychotropic drugs were the most frequently pharmacotherapeutic subgroups involved. Seventeen percent of reported ADRs were serious; of them fever, vomiting and angioedema were the most frequently reported. Eight percent of ADRs were associated with off-label use, and 10% were unknown ADRs. Analysis of these revealed possible strategies of therapy optimization. The MEAP project demonstrated that active post-marketing pharmacovigilance programs are a valid strategy to increase awareness on pediatric pharmacology, reduce underreporting and provide information on drug actions in pediatrics. This information enhances drug therapy optimization in the pediatric patients.\n[Drug skin tests in cutaneous adverse drug reactions to pristinamycin: 29 cases with a study of cross-reactions between synergistins.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15059099)\nBarbaud, A; Trechot, P; Weber-Muller, F; Ulrich, G; Commun, N; Schmutz, J L\n2004-01-01\nThe present study was made to determine the value of drug skin tests in patients with cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) due to a synergistin (pristinamycin) and to determine the frequency of cross-reactions between synergistins. 29 patients were referred during the onset of the CADR due to pristinamycin: 18 with maculopapular rash, 9 erythrodermas, 1 angioedema and 1 Stevens-Johnson syndrome. They all had patch tests with pristinamycin and, in most cases, with other synergistins [virginiamycin and dalfopristin-quinupristin (DQ)], prick tests (10 cases) and intradermal tests (IDT) (5 cases). Skin tests with synergistins were positive in 27 cases, patch tests with pristinamycin in 20/29 cases (69%), prick tests with pristinamycin in 3/9 cases on immediate (1 case) or on delayed (2 cases) readings, and IDT with DQ in 4/5 cases. Cross-reactions between synergistins occurred in 9/22 with virginiamycin and in 7/8 cases with DQ. Skin tests with synergistins are useful in investigating CADR due to pristinamycin. Synergistins are composed of 2 chains (1 depsipeptide and 1 macrocyclic lactone) with many structural analogies between all synergistins. According to the chemical structures and our results, it seems advisable to avoid all synergistins in patients with CADR due to pristinamycin.\n[The EAACI/GA\u00b2LEN/EDF/WAO Guideline for the Definition, Classification, Diagnosis and Management of Urticaria.

The conference was held on December 1st, 2016. It is a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the EU-founded network of excellence, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA\u00b2LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), and the World Allergy Organization (WAO) with the participation of 48 delegates of 42 national and international societies. This guideline was acknowledged and accepted by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS). Urticaria is a frequent, mast cell-driven disease, presenting with wheals, angioedema, or both. The lifetime prevalence for acute urticaria is approximately 20%. Chronic spontaneous urticaria and other chronic forms of urticaria are disabling, impair quality of life, and affect performance at work and school. This guideline covers the definition and classification of urticaria, taking into account the recent progress in identifying its causes, eliciting factors and pathomechanisms. In addition, it outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the different subtypes of urticaria. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

It has been designed to use the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) space technique as an optical link between ground and space clocks. T2L2, as all the instruments aboard Jason-2, is referenced to the Ultra Stable Oscillator (USO) provided by the Doppler Orbitography and Radio-positioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) system. A complex data processing has been developed in order to extract time & frequency products as the relative frequency bias of the USO from ground-to-space time transfer passages. The precision of these products was estimated of a few parts in 10-13 given the very good in-flight performance of T2L2 with a ground-to-space time stability of a few picoseconds (ps) over 100 s. Frequency bias from T2L2 were compared with results from operational orbit computation, notably with the DIODE (D\u00e9termination Imm\u00e9diate d'Orbite par Doris Embarqu\u00e9) outputs (see Jayles et al. (2016) same issue) at the level of 1 \u00b7 10-12. The present paper is focusing on the main physical effects which drive the frequency variations of the Jason-2 USO during its flight, notably over the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) area. In addition to the effects of radiation we studied the effect of the residual temperature variations, in the range 8-11 \u00b0C (measured on-board). A model was established to represent these effects on the short term with empirical coefficients (sensitivities of the USO) to be adjusted. The results of fitting the model over \u223c200 10-day periods, from 2008 to 2014, show the sensitivities of the Jason-2 USO to temperature and radiation. The analysis of the 6-year output series of empirical coefficients allows us to conclude that: (i) the temperature to frequency dependence is very stable along time at the level of around -1.2 \u00b7 10-12 per \u00b0C, (ii) the radiation effects are much lower than those previously detected on the Jason-1 USO with\n[Medici\u00f3n de los par\u00e1metros cosmol\u00f3gicos q0, \u03a9M, y \u03a9\u039b, usando supernovas de Tipo Ia distantes](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998BAAA...42...64C) [NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html)\nClocchiatti, A.; High-Z Sne Search Team\nLas supernovas de tipo Ia son una herramienta de gran precisi\u00f3n para la medici\u00f3n de distancias de inter\u00e9s cosmol\u00f3gico.

The start-up creations or university spin-offs (USOs) company is a very special start-up company that is founded by an academic inventor and the university with the aim to commercialize the technological innovation that created by the university. However, it is not always as smooth as expected. The market competitiveness of the USOs obviously has many challenges to be able to compete with the existing companies, analysis need to be done to get the right business step so the business strategy will be efficient. In this article, we discuss a real case study of a university spin-off that owned by Sebelas Maret University for Commercializing Battery Lithium. The aim of our research is twofold: first, to identify the gap in the literature of business strategy formulation between a conventional and USOs. Second, to propose a business strategy formulation for commercializing university-created technology, i.e. battery lithium as core business of a university spin-off as a case study. We conduct surveys, observation and FGD in order to collect the data and information to build the company objective and goals. The analytical tools to generate the solution of business strategy are SWOT analysis, IFE-EFE matrix, and QSPM model so the result will be the most attractive and suitable for the company. The result shows that the case study of USO company is classified on conservative continuous improvement phase so the suitable strategy for this company are product development and business strategy integration.\n[Motivational and Skills Training HIV/STI Sexual Risk Reduction Groups for Men](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=2749552)\nCalsyn, Donald A.; Hatch-Maillette, Mary; Tross, Susan; Doyle, Suzanne R.; Crits-Christoph, Paul; Song, Yong S.; Harrer, Judy M.; Lalos, Genise; Berns, Sara B.\n2009-01-01\nThe effectiveness of a motivational and skills training HIV/AIDS group intervention designed for men in substance abuse treatment was evaluated. Men in methadone maintenance (n=288) or outpatient psychosocial treatment (n=302) completed assessments at baseline, 2 weeks, 3- and 6-months post intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to attend either \u201cReal Men Are Safe\u201d (REMAS; five sessions containing information, motivational exercises and skills training), or HIV education (HIV-Ed; one session containing HIV prevention information). REMAS participants engaged in significantly fewer unprotected vaginal and anal sexual intercourse occasions (USO) during the 90 days prior to the 3- and 6-month follow-ups than HIV-Ed participants. Completing REMAS resulted in an even stronger effect: completers reduced their number of USO by 21% from baseline to 6-month follow-up. In contrast, HIV-Ed completers increased the number of USO by 2%. A motivational and skills training HIV prevention intervention designed for men was associated with greater sexual risk reduction over standard HIV education. Substance abuse treatment programs can therefore help reduce sexual risk among their clientele by providing a more intensive intervention than what is traditionally provided.

Participants were recruited from community drug treatment programs participating in the National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). Data were pooled from two parallel randomized controlled CTN studies (one with men and one with women) each examining the impact of a multi-session motivational and skills training program, in comparison to a single-session HIV education intervention, on the degree of reduction in unprotected sex from baseline to 3- and 6- month follow-ups. The findings were analyzed using a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model. Severity of drug use (p < .01), gender (p < .001), and age (p < .001) were significant main effect predictors of number of unprotected sexual occasions (USOs) at follow-up in the non-zero portion of the ZINB model (men, younger participants, and those with greater severity of drug/alcohol abuse have more USOs). Monogamous relationship status (p < .001) and race/ethnicity (p < .001) were significant predictors of having at least one USO vs. none (monogamous individuals and African Americans were more likely to have at least one USO). Significant moderators of intervention effectiveness included recent sex under the influence of drugs/alcohol (p < .01 in non-zero portion of model), duration of abuse of primary drug (p < .05 in non-zero portion of model), and Hispanic ethnicity (p < .01 in the zero portion, p < .05 in the non-zero portion of model). These predictor and moderator findings point to ways in which patients may be selected for the different HIV sexual risk reduction interventions and suggest potential avenues for further development of the interventions for increasing their effectiveness within certain subgroups.\n[International Space Station Common Cabin Air Assembly Condensing Heat Exchanger Hydrophilic Coating Failures and Lessons Learned](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20100040574&hterms=common+good&qs=N%3D0%26Ntk%3DAll%26Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall%26Ntt%3Dcommon%2Bgood) [NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp)\nBalistreri, Steven F.; Shaw, Laura A.; Laliberte, Yvon\n2010-01-01\nThe ability to control the temperature and humidity of an environment or habitat is critical for human survival. These factors are important to maintaining human health and comfort, as well as maintaining mechanical and electrical equipment in good working order to support the human and to accomplish mission objectives. The temperature and humidity of the International Space Station (ISS) United States On-orbit Segment (USOS) cabin air is controlled by the Common Cabin Air Assembly (CCAA). The CCAA consists of a fan, a condensing heat exchanger (CHX), an air/water separator, temperature and liquid sensors, and electrical controlling hardware and software. The CHX is the primary component responsible for control of temperature and humidity. The CCAA CHX contains a chemical coating that was developed to be hydrophilic and thus attract water from the humid influent air. This attraction forms the basis for water removal and therefore cabin humidity control. However, there have been several instances of CHX coatings becoming hydrophobic and repelling water. When this behavior is observed in an operational CHX, the unit s ability to remove moisture from the air is compromised and the result is liquid water carryover into downstream ducting and systems. This water carryover can have detrimental effects on the cabin atmosphere quality and on the health of downstream hardware. If the water carryover is severe and widespread, this behavior can result in an inability to maintain humidity levels in the USOS. This paper will describe the operation of the five CCAAs within in the USOS, the potential causes of the hydrophobic condition, and the impacts of the resulting water carryover to downstream systems. It will describe the history of this behavior and the actual observed impacts to the ISS USOS. Information on mitigation steps to protect the health of future CHX hydrophilic coatings and potential remediation techniques will also be discussed.\n[Current use of wild plants with edible underground storage organs in a rural population of Patagonia: between tradition and change.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26407590)\nOchoa, Juan Jos\u00e9; Ladio, Ana Haydee\n2015-09-25\nEdible plants with underground storage organs (USOs) are neglected resources. We studied the local ecological knowledge edible plants with (USOs) in rural populations of North-Patagonia in order to establish how people are utilizing these plants. Some aspect of corpus-praxis-cosmos complex associated to the local ecological knowledge was documented and discussed. In addition, variation in this ecological knowledge due to age, gender, family structure, ethnic self-determination was also evaluated. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 51 inhabitants in order to study the relationship between the current use of plants with USOs and the age, sex, family group composition and ethnic self-identification of interviewees. In addition, the Cultural Importance Index for each species was calculated. The current richness of known species in these populations is a total of 9 plants. Plants with USOs tend to be used more frequently as the age of the interviewee increases. Women and men showed no differences in the average richness of species cited. The interviewees who share their homes with other generations use these plants more frequently than those who live alone. Our results indicate that the interviewees who identified themselves as belonging to the Mapuche people use these plants more frequently. For the Mapuche people, wild plants have constituted material and symbolic resources of great importance in their historical subsistence. In addition, they are currently being redefined as elements which present a connection with ancestral practices, produce a strong relationship with the 'land', and become markers which identify the 'natural' (historical) ways of their people; these are key elements in the current political processes of identity revaluation. This research is valuable to stimulate cultural revival and health promotion programs in the communities with their own local, cultural food.\n[Use of black vulture (Coragyps atratus) in complementary and alternative therapies for cancer in Colombia: A qualitative study](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3473314)\n2012-01-01\nBackground Although Coragyps atratus has been used as a traditional therapy for patients with cancer, the scientific literature does not contain enough information on how this therapy is used or the mechanisms that explain this therapeutic practice. Objectives To understand the methods of use and the reasons given by patients and caregivers for the use of Coragyps atratus in cancer treatment. Methods This study used a qualitative design based on twenty in-depth interviews of patients with cancer or caregivers of patients with the disease. The analysis of the text was based on an inductive thematic approach. Results Resistance to disease and immune enhancement are properties attributed to Coragyps atratus when used for cancer treatment. The most recommended method of use is fresh blood ingestion, and the associated mechanism of action is transfer of immune factors to the individual who consumes it. Conclusions Use of Coragyps atratus as a treatment for cancer is a popular alternative therapy in Colombia. More studies are needed to understand the clinical effects of this intervention in cancer patients.

A quarter of undocumented FSW had never used National Health Service (NHS) and 15 % never tested for HIV, significantly more than nationals (p < 0.001 and p = 0.024, respectively). HIV infection was self-reported by 11.9 % of nationals, 1.8 % of documented and 0.8 % of undocumented migrants (p < 0.001). The HIV rapid test was reactive in 13.6 % of undocumented, 8.0 % of nationals and 2.3 % of documented. A higher proportion of migrants were unaware of their positive serostatus compared to nationals. Ever had HIV testing was less likely among undocumented, who never used the NHS and who didn't know where to go if suspected being HIV-infected. Promoting early diagnosis with linkage to care among migrant FSW should be supported, while developing health services better tailored to their needs.

The oils of all cultivars resulted in rich amount of linoleic acid (\u03c9-6) and \u03b1-linolenic acid (\u03c9-3). Felina 32 and Chamaeleon oils exhibited the highest amount of linoleic acid (59%) and \u03b1-linolenic acid (18%). Finola and Uso31 oils resulted in the richest of \u03b3-linolenic acid (5-6%). All hempseed oils presented high oxidation stability and an acceptable initial quality.

Objectives: To study the clinical patterns and PPD contact sensitivity in patients with hair-dye dermatitis. Materials and Methods: Eighty (M:F 47:33) consecutive patients aged between 18 and 74 years suspected to have contact allergy from hair dye were studied by patch testing with Indian Standard Series including p-phenylenediamine (PPD, 1.0% pet). Results: 54 Fifty-four (M:F 21:33) patients showed positive patch tests from PPD. Eight of these patients also showed positive patch test reaction from fragrance mix, thiuram mix, paraben mix, or colophony. Fifty-seven (71%) patients affected were aged older than 40 years. The duration of dermatitis varied from < 1 month to > 1 year with exacerbation following hair coloring. Forty-nine patients had dermatitis of scalp and/or scalp margins and 23 patients had face and neck dermatitis. Periorbital dermatitis, chronic actinic dermatitis, and erythema multiforme-like lesions were seen in 4, 2, and 1 patients, respectively. Conclusions: Hair dyes and PPD constitute a significant cause of contact dermatitis. There is an urgent need for creating consumer awareness regarding hair-dyes contact sensitivity and the significance of performing sensitivity testing prior to actual use.

Rapid evolution of contact dermatitis to ammonium persulfate into airborne contact dermatitis with rhinitis and asthma in a hairdresser].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21141453)\nPoltronieri, Anna; Patrini, L; Pigatto, P; Riboldi, L; Marsili, Chiara; Previdi, M; Margonari, M; Marraccini, P\n2010-01-01\nHairdressers are exposed to irritants and allergenic compounds that may cause contact dermatitis, rhinitis and asthma. In this paper we describe the case of a female, age 33 years, who developed contact dermatitis after 10 years of exposure to ammonium persulfate. After 7 months of progressively extensive and persistent skin lesions, respiratory symptoms appeared that were related to the occupational exposure (on-off test). SIDAPA and specific occupational patch test for hairdressers and occupational challenge with ammonium persulfate were performed. Clinical parameters of inflammation, ECP (eosinophil cationic protein) and exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were detected before and after the specific bronchial challenge. The patch test was positive to ammonium persulfate (++), and bronchial challenge for ammonium persulfate showed a significant late response (FEV1 decrease--33%). Both FeNO and ECP showed a significant increase after 24 hours. Dermatitis, urticaria and angioedema occurred on the uncovered skin due to airborne contact. Topic steroids and anti-histaminic drugs resolved the clinical symptoms. Bronchial challenge is, in fact, considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of occupational asthma, although new inflammatory parameters can contribute to the diagnosis and can be useful for monitoring after a specific inhalation test with occupational agents. The described case summarizes the evolution from contact dermatitis to inhalation allergy, suggesting the occurrence of an allergic \"march\" for occupational allergy.\n[Immediate Reactions to More Than 1 NSAID Must Not Be Considered Cross-Hypersensitivity Unless Tolerance to ASA Is Verified.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28211343)\nP\u00e9rez-Alzate, D; Cornejo-Garc\u00eda, J A; P\u00e9rez-S\u00e1nchez, N; Andreu, I; Garc\u00eda-Moral, A; Ag\u00fandez, J A; Bartra, J; Do\u00f1a, I; Torres, M J; Blanca, M; Blanca-L\u00f3pez, N; Canto, G\nIndividuals who develop drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) to chemically unrelated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered cross-hypersensitive. The hallmark for this classification is that the patient presents a reaction after intake of or challenge with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Whether patients react to 2 or more NSAIDs while tolerating ASA remains to be studied (selective reactions, SRs). Objective: To identify patients with SRs to 2 or more NSAIDs including strong COX-1 inhibitors. Patients who attended the Allergy Service of Hospital Infanta Leonor, Madrid, Spain with DHRs to NSAIDs between January 2011 and December 2014 were evaluated. Those with 2 or more immediate reactions occurring in less than 1 hour after intake were included. After confirming tolerance to ASA, the selectivity of the response to 2 or more NSAIDs was demonstrated by in vivo and/or in vitro testing or by controlled administration. From a total of 203 patients with immediate DHRs to NSAIDs, 16 (7.9%) met the inclusion criteria. The patients presented a total of 68 anaphylactic or cutaneous reactions (mean [SD], 4.2 [2.1]). Most reactions were to ibuprofen and other arylpropionic acid derivatives and to metamizole. Two different NSAIDs were involved in 11 patients and 3 in 5 patients. Patients with NSAID-induced anaphylaxis or urticaria/angioedema should not be considered cross-hypersensitive unless tolerance to ASA is verified.\n[Drug hypersensitivity in children: report from the pediatric task force of the EAACI Drug Allergy Interest Group.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26416157)\nGomes, E R; Brockow, K; Kuyucu, S; Saretta, F; Mori, F; Blanca-Lopez, N; Ott, H; Atanaskovic-Markovic, M; Kidon, M; Caubet, J-C; Terreehorst, I\n2016-02-01\nWhen questioned, about 10% of the parents report suspected hypersensitivity to at least one drug in their children. However, only a few of these reactions can be confirmed as allergic after a diagnostic workup. There is still a lack of knowledge on drug hypersensitivity (DH) epidemiology, clinical spectrum, and appropriate diagnostic methods particularly in children. Meanwhile, the tools used for DH management in adults are applied also for children. Whereas this appears generally acceptable, some aspects of DH and management differ with age. Most reactions in children are still attributed to betalactams. Some manifestations, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated angioedema and serum sickness-like reactions, are more frequent among young patients as compared to adults. Risk factors such as viral infections are particularly frequent in children, making the diagnosis challenging. The practicability and validity of skin test and other diagnostic procedures need further assessment in children. This study presents an up-to-date review on epidemiology, clinical spectrum, diagnostic tools, and current management of DH in children. A new general algorithm for the study of these reactions in children is proposed. Data are presented focusing on reported differences between pediatric and adult patients, also identifying unmet needs to be addressed in further research. \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Prevalence varies between 2% and 8%, although it could vary according to age and ethnicity. Clinical manifestations are diverse among systems. There is few information about this issue. To know epidemiologic features in patients with food allergy attended at Monterrey University Hospital. An observational, transversal and retrospective study was done, identifying 60 patients with food allergy diagnosis attended in our service from June 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008. Epidemiologic and clinical data were registered. Data was processed with statistical program SPSS v16.0 for windows with descriptive statistic. The frequency of food allergy reported in first time medical consultation was 2.67%, 51% of the patients were under 5 years of age. Most frequent foods were: dairy products, egg, fish, shrimp, beans, soy, chili, mango, cacao, and strawberry. Main symptoms were cutaneous in 58% of the patients, followed by gastrointestinal and respiratory. Most common concomitant diseases were: urticarial angioedema (38%), allergic rhinitis (20%), atopic dermatitis (15%), and asthma (6.6%). Average time for diagnosis was 1.45 years. Most common foods with positive Prick test results were dairy products, egg and fish. Despite the variability of the clinical manifestations, cutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations are the most frequent; however, the diagnosis depends on the suspicion as well.\n[Autologous serum skin test as an indicator of chronic autoimmune urticaria in a tertiary care hospital in South India.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25593814)\nVikramkumar, Adaikalampillai Ganapathy; Kuruvila, Sheela; Ganguly, Satyaki\n2014-12-01\nAutologous serum skin test (ASST) is a simple in-vivo clinical test for the detection of basophil histamine releasing activity and to diagnose chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU) among chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) patients. Diagnosing these patients is also important as they may need high doses of antihistamines and systemic corticosteroids during acute exacerbations. The aim of this study is to study the prevalence of CAU among cases of CSU by using ASST. This was a cross-sectional study done among 48 patients presenting with CSU. Detailed history, physical examination and routine investigations were recorded for all patients. ASST was done on all the 48 patients. Of the 48 patients included in the study, 20 patients (41.6%) were ASST positive, while the remaining 28 (58%) were ASST negative. The median duration of disease in both ASST positive and negative patients was 1 year. ASST positivity was higher (66.6%) among patients with a history of round shaped weals, though not statistically significant. ASST positivity was seen in 5 (71.4%) out of seven patients with systemic involvement, which was again not statistically significant. Our study did not show any significant difference between patients with and without antibodies regarding mean age and sex distribution, clinical morphology of individual weals, duration, severity, systemic symptoms, angioedema, atopy, and association with other autoimmune conditions.\n[Recurrent elevated liver transaminases and acute liver failure in two siblings with novel bi-allelic mutations of NBAS.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28576691)\nRegateiro, Frederico S; Belkaya, Serkan; Neves, N\u00e9lson; Ferreira, Sandra; Silvestre, Paula; Lemos, S\u00f3nia; Ven\u00e2ncio, Margarida; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Gon\u00e7alves, Isabel; Jouanguy, Emmanuelle; Diogo, Lu\u00edsa\n2017-08-01\nAcute liver failure (ALF) in children can be life-threatening. Although many causes are known, ALF remains unexplained in about half of the cases. Recently, bi-allelic mutations in NBAS were reported to underlie recurrent episodes of elevated liver transaminases (ELT) and ALF in the context of diverse extrahepatic phenotypes. We here describe two sisters, born to non-consanguineous Portuguese parents, who had short stature and presented with recurrent episodes of severe ELT triggered by febrile respiratory viral infections since early childhood. Patient 1 had mild facial dysmorphism and died during the second ELT crisis at 3-11/12 years of age. Patient 2, currently 9 years old, had multiple episodes of ELT (>30), twice with ALF, often accompanied by extensive urticaria and facial angioedema. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing revealed that both patients carried previously undescribed compound heterozygous mutations of NBAS (NM_015909.3): c.680A > C (p.His227Pro), affecting an evolutionarily conserved residue, and c.1749G > A (p.Trp583*), causing a premature stop codon. Both mutations are predicted to be highly damaging. The parents and two younger siblings are healthy and heterozygous for one or another mutant allele. The multiplex kindred reported herein expands the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of this recently described clinical syndrome due to autosomal recessive NBAS deficiency.

Two hundred and thirty six patients with suspected drug sensitization to penicillin, streptomycin, sulfamides, pyrazolones and A.S.A. were analyzed. Seventy-nine of them were allergic; in 43 cases it was confirmed by in vivo methods. Other patients were diagnosed by clinical history only if they had more than two reactions to the same drug. In order to be included in this group patients with reactions to pyrazolones and A.S.A. had to have tolerated other NSAI, therefore these patients were allergic to one compound only. All patients were considered non-allergic were determined by a negative provocation test. In the group of allergic patients we obtained 63 (79%) positive degranulations and 16 (21%) negative. One hundred and thirty two (84%) negative degranulations and 25 (16%) positive were obtained in the group of non-allergic patients. Once having analyzed 10 statistical parameters with each drug, the HBOT appears to be a useful method for these drugs except for streptomycin. In 16 (80%) out of 20 aspirin sensitive asthmatic patients we found that their basophils were degranulated. In 7 patients with urticaria and/or angioedema by A.S.A. and other NSAI the degranulation was negative, confirming the absence of the involvement of basophils in this reactions.\n[The safety of sacubitril-valsartan for the treatment of chronic heart failure.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28060547)\nTyler, Jeffrey M; Teerlink, John R\n2017-02-01\nSacubitril-valsartan is a combination drug that contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved sacubitril-valsartan for treatment of heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction and New York Heart Association class II-IV symptoms following a large, Phase III clinical trial (PARADIGM-HF) that demonstrated a 20% reduction in the combined primary end-point of death from cardiovascular cause or hospitalization for heart failure compared to enalapril. Areas covered: This review discusses the clinical efficacy and safety of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril-valsartan in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Expert opinion: Based on the PARADIGM-HF trial, sacubitril-valsartan offers compelling reductions in meaningful clinical endpoints, independent of age or severity of disease. The rate of adverse events was comparable between the enalapril and sacubitril-valsartan groups, although the absolute rates are likely underestimated due to the entry criteria and run-in period. Future trials and post-market surveillance are critical to better understand the risk of angioedema in high risk populations, particularly African-Americans, as well as long-term theoretical risks including the potential for increased cerebral amyloid plaque deposition with possible development of neurocognitive disease. Current trials are underway to evaluate potential benefit in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\n[Neprilysin inhibition in chronic kidney disease](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=4425478)\nJudge, Parminder; Haynes, Richard; Landray, Martin J.; Baigent, Colin\n2015-01-01\nDespite current practice, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of progression to end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular events. Neprilysin inhibition (NEPi) is a new therapeutic strategy with potential to improve outcomes for patients with CKD. NEPi enhances the activity of natriuretic peptide systems leading to natriuresis, diuresis and inhibition of the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS), which could act as a potentially beneficial counter-regulatory system in states of RAS activation such as chronic heart failure (HF) and CKD. Early NEPi drugs were combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors but were associated with unacceptable rates of angioedema and, therefore, withdrawn. However, one such agent (omapatrilat) showed promise of NEP/RAS inhibition in treating CKD in animal models, producing greater reductions in proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis compared with isolated RAS inhibition. A new class of drug called angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) has been developed. One such drug, LCZ696, has shown substantial benefits in trials in hypertension and HF. In CKD, HF is common due to a range of mechanisms including hypertension and structural heart disease (including left ventricular hypertrophy), suggesting that ARNi could benefit patients with CKD by both retarding the progression of CKD (hence delaying the need for renal replacement therapy) and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. LCZ696 is now being studied in a CKD population.

It is a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the EU-funded network of excellence, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA(2) LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), and the World Allergy Organization (WAO) with the participation of delegates of 21 national and international societies. Urticaria is a frequent, mast cell-driven disease, presenting with wheals, angioedema, or both. The life-time prevalence for acute urticaria is approximately 20%. Chronic spontaneous urticaria and other chronic forms of urticaria do not only cause a decrease in quality of life, but also affect performance at work and school and, as such, are members of the group of severe allergic diseases. This guideline covers the definition and classification of urticaria, taking into account the recent progress in identifying its causes, eliciting factors and pathomechanisms. In addition, it outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the different subtypes of urticaria.

Because these illnesses may affect maternal comfort and safety as well as threaten the fetus directly (anaphylaxis) or indirectly, they often require therapy during pregnancy. Based on the information available to date, in this chapter we have attempted to provide rational guidelines for the gestational use of H1-receptor antagonists in a manner that will lead to the optimal well-being of both the mother and her infant. As more information becomes available, the recommendations herein may require modification. Although this chapter has dealt specifically with gestational management, a case can be made for considering this information when making therapeutic decisions in all women of childbearing potential. First, most pregnancies are unplanned, and the peak period of fetal vulnerability to drug-induced teratogenesis begins the day a woman's period is due. Second, during gestation, substantial alterations in a previously successful but not optimal-for-pregnancy chronic therapeutic regimen may be psychologically threatening to the patient and may lead to either uncontrolled disease or unanticipated side effects. Thus, pregnancy-appropriate regimens should ideally be discussed with all women of childbearing age as part of the informed therapeutic decision-making process.\n[DESAF\u00cdOS \u00c9TICOS DE LA INVESTIGACI\u00d3N CON ANIMALES, MANIPULACI\u00d3N GEN\u00c9TICA](https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=3711750)\nYunta, Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez\n2012-01-01\nEn la investigaci\u00f3n con animales existen cuestionamientos \u00e9ticos tanto en el uso como modelos de enfermedades humanas y requisito previo para ensayos en humanos como en la introducci\u00f3n de modificaciones gen\u00e9ticas.

To evaluate the clinical and allergologic features of anaphylaxis in children referred to the allergology and immunology unit of A. Meyer Children's Hospital (Florence, Italy) from 1994 to 1996. Ninety-five episodes of anaphylaxis occurred in 76 children (50 boys and 26 girls). Sixty-six children (87%) had only one episode of anaphylaxis, while 10 (13%) had two or more episodes. Sixty-two (82%) of the 76 patients had a personal history of atopic symptoms, although 14 (18%) did not. Sixty (79%) of the 76 children studied had at least one positive skin prick test to one or more of the common inhalant and/or food allergens. Children with venom-induced anaphylaxis usually had negative skin tests to the allergens tested. A younger age and eczema were more frequent among children with food-dependent anaphylaxis, whereas an older age together with urticaria-angioedema were common among those with exercise-induced anaphylaxis. The mean latent period (+/-SD) of the anaphylaxis episodes was 15.4 +/- 27.5 minutes. Skin and respiratory manifestations had an earlier onset and were more common than the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular ones. The most frequent clinical manifestation in children with food anaphylaxis was gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas cardiovascular symptoms were rare. The most probable causative agents in the 95 episodes described were foods (57%), drugs (11%), hymenoptera venom (12%), exercise (9%), additives (1%), specific immunotherapy (1%), latex (1%), and vaccines (2%), but in 6 cases (6%) the agent was never determined.

Apresentam maior seguran\u00e7a para infus\u00e3o de solu\u00e7\u00f5es vesicantes/irritantes e hiperosmolares, antibioticoterapia, nutri\u00e7\u00e3o parenteral prolongada (NPT) e uso de quimioter\u00e1picos; demonstram reduzido risco de infec\u00e7\u00e3o em compara\u00e7\u00e3o a outros cateteres vasculares e maior rela\u00e7\u00e3o custo/benef\u00edcio se comparados ao cateter venoso de inser\u00e7\u00e3o central (CVCIC). Objetivos Apresentar os resultados de implantes de PICCs ecoguiados e posicionados por fluoroscopia realizados no Hospital e Maternidade S\u00e3o Luiz (HMSL) Itaim, Rede D\u2019or, Brasil. M\u00e9todos Estudo prospectivo, n\u00e3o randomizado, realizado entre fevereiro de 2015 e novembro de 2016. Utilizou-se protocolo pr\u00e9-estabelecido pela institui\u00e7\u00e3o em casos de solicita\u00e7\u00e3o de acesso vascular. Foram analisadas indica\u00e7\u00f5es, doen\u00e7as prevalentes, tipo do cateter implantado, sucesso t\u00e9cnico, complica\u00e7\u00f5es relacionadas ao cateter, e estabelecidos crit\u00e9rios de inclus\u00e3o e exclus\u00e3o. Resultados Solicitados 256 acessos vasculares, sendo implantados 236 PICCs (92,1%) e 20 CVCICs (7,9%). Principais indica\u00e7\u00f5es: antibioticoterapia prolongada (52,0%), NPT (19,3%) e acesso venoso dif\u00edcil (16,0%). Houve sucesso t\u00e9cnico em 246 cateteres implantados (96,1%). A veia bas\u00edlica direita foi a principal veia puncionada em 192 pacientes (75,0%), seguida da braquial direita em 28 pacientes (10,9%). Conclus\u00f5es O implante dos PICCs ecoguiados e posicionados por fluoroscopia demonstrou baixa incid\u00eancia de complica\u00e7\u00f5es, reduzidos \u00edndices de infec\u00e7\u00e3o e \u00e9 seguro e eficaz em casos de acessos vasculares dif\u00edceis, sendo esses cateteres considerados dispositivos de escolha em acesso vascular central.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null,
