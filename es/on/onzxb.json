With their deep contemplations on love and loss, Le\u00f3n\u2019s songs have quickly catapulted him up the U.S. Latin charts and right into the feels of Spanish and non-Spanish speakers alike.\nHowever, his most well-known chart-topper, \u201cEl T\u00f3xico,\u201d is not as tender as the other hits he wears on his sleeve. A song that spent 28 weeks on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart, peaking at No. 9 and becoming an instant ear-worm, \u201cEl T\u00f3xico\u201d isn\u2019t just a tune about getting over a bad breakup. \u201cEl T\u00f3xico\u201d is about getting even.\nMeaning Behind the Lyrics\nAccompanied by Grupo Firme, a Regional Mexican band, Le\u00f3n\u2019s words bite as he narrates a breakup and gives his ex fair warning that he is ready to be \u201cEl T\u00f3xico.\u201d\nLe\u00f3n wastes no time, promising to be his ex\u2019s worst nightmare. The song opens with Porque para amarme / Te di mil razones / Voy a darte el doble / Pero pa\u2019 que me odies / Y con ganas de no haberme conocido / Voy a ser tu peor castigo / Voy a ser la piedra en tu camino, which translates (via lyricstranslated) to Because I gave you a thousand reasons to love me / I\u2019m going to give you double. / But for you to hate me and to wish you had never met me / I\u2019m going to be your worst punishment /I\u2019m going to be the stone in your road.\nFrom the jump, Le\u00f3n and Grupo Firme make it known that this will not be an easy breakup. There will be no clean break, no staying amicable, and no exchanging of possessions. \u201cI\u2019m going to be your worst punishment,\u201d the song promises.\nTe daba mi vida / Y te vali\u00f3 madre / Cuando m\u00e1s te amaba / Te fuiste sin darme explicaciones / Fui el mejor el mejor de tus amores / Hoy el peor de tus errores, the song continues, meaning I gave you my life and it was worth nothing to you / When I loved you the most, you left me without an explanation / I was the best, the best out of your lovers / Today, your worst mistake.\nThe love ended for one party while the other hangs on. \u201cI was the best, the best out of your lovers,\u201d he sings, but now things have turned sour and the dumper will soon regret their decision.\nYou\u2019re going to abhor me / Because I swear I\u2019m going to hold on, the lyrics explain in the lines: Me vas a aborrecer / Porque te juro que voy a aferrarme.\nI\u2019m going to be your ex, the toxic one / The unnameable. / A nightmare, a toothache, they sing in the words: Voy a ser tu ex, el t\u00f3xico / El innombrable / Una pesadilla, un dolor de muelas.\nThe ex is going to pay for this heartache, \u201cEl T\u00f3xico\u201d promises. The song continues to explain the lengths the dumped will go to in order to exact their revenge. Even the dog I\u2019m going to poison, the tune lists with Y, de paso, hasta el perro voy a envenenarte.\nY no te imaginas qu\u00e9 alacr\u00e1n te echaste / En tu perra vida, vas a hallar la calma / Hasta que te mueras o hasta que me mates, the threats come to a climax before the song repeats. You can\u2019t imagine what a scorpion you\u2019ve made for yourself / In your bitch life, you\u2019re going to look for calm / Until you die or until you kill me, they sing.\nLe\u00f3n has become a familiar face on the U.S. Latin charts over the past few years.\n(translation
