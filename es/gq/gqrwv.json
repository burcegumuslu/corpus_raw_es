It has demonstrated good stability over time without losing its quality required as a product for up \nto two years. But stability studies have shown that the useful shelf-life of this product could be extended to three \nyears. Therefore, this work was aimed to evaluate the possible toxic potential of VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae, in a single \ndose study conducted in Sprague Dawley rats. Batches of VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae kept at a controlled temperature of 4 \nto 8 \u00b0 C for 24 and 36 months were administered to animals. The experimental design included the daily observa -\ntion of animals, the assessment of water and food consumption, thermometry, muscle volume and body weight. \nAnimals were necropsied for anatomopathological studies, seeking for evidences of possible adverse effects after \nimmunization. No symptoms of toxicity or deaths were observed during the study. No differences of toxicological \ninterest were found among the experimental groups in terms of body weight, water and food consumption. No le -\nsions of diagnostic value were observed in anatomopathologic analyses. At the site of inoculation, granulomatous \nprocesses as mediated by macrophage activation were found, which are characteristic of vaccines adjuvanted with \naluminum hydroxide. These results indicated that the shelf-life of the VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae vaccine can be extended \nfrom 24 to 36 months, due to the lack of local adverse or systemic toxic effects in the assayed animal model.  \nKeywords: vaccine toxicity, VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae, single dose, Sprague Dawley rats\nBiotecnolog\u00eda Aplicada 2018;35:1501-1503 \nRESUMEN     \nToxicidad por dosis \u00fanica de la vacuna antimeningoc\u00f3ccica VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae en ratas Sprague Dawley \npara extender su vida \u00fatil en anaquel hasta 36 meses.

This is a Gram-\nnegative bacterium that colonizes the respiratory tract \nasymptomatically, with five main disease-causing se -\nrogroups: A, C, Y , W135, and B [1].\nThe incidence and geographic distribution of the \ndisease and the causative serogroups constantly \nchange, with a global increased prevalence coincident \nwith endemism of the disease. For instance, there is a socalled \u2018meningitis belt\u2019 in Africa, with several \ncountries in Asia and South America where there is a \nsignificant incidence of the disease. The World Health \nOrganization (WHO) has alerted on the latent risk for \nmajor epidemics in some of those countries [2-4].\nIn this setting, vaccination has been used to prevent \ninfections and to control outbreaks. One of the vaccines \navailable is V A-MENGOC-BC\u00ae [5], registered by the \nFinlay Institute for the effective immunization against 1.

This vaccine has \nshown positive results in studies of preclinical toxicol -\nogy, stability and clinical evaluation, been administered \nin humans for more than 25 years. This supported its \nsanitary registration with a shelf-life of two years.\nThe V A-MENGOC-BC\u00ae vaccine is routinely \nchecked for physicochemical composition and stabil -\nity characterizations, despite the lack of preclinical \ntoxicological studies in animal models which could \nevidence the absence of vaccine toxicity upon its stor -\nage for several months at 4-8 \u00baC under controlled con -\nditions. Furthermore, there is no regulation enforcing \nthe need for toxicological testing of vaccine products \nonce produced following GMP and certified for a giv -\nen shelf-life time.\nTherefore, in order to evaluate any possible toxic \nevent derived from the extension of the shelf-life from \nits approved 24 months period to 36 months, a single-\ndose toxicity study was conducted in mice, further \ncomplemented by vaccine safety analyses through \nphysico-chemical and stability characterizations.\nMaterials and methods\nExperimental design and animals\nThe study was designed following the recommenda -\ntions and guidelines issued by the WHO for the evalu -\nation of vaccines [4, 6]. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats of \nboth sexes, 6-8 weeks old and weighing 198-210 g were \nused, as supplied by the National Center for the Produc -\ntion of Laboratory Animals (CENPALAB, Cuba) ac -\ncompanied by their certificates of sanitary quality and \nzootechnics. The animal model was chosen based on its \nrelevance for toxicological studies against meningitis \n[7, 8] and V A-MENGOC-BC\u00ae preclinical safety [9].\nTreatment groups, route of administration and \ndose\nThree experimental groups of 10 animals of both sexes \neach were assayed. A control group received phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS) as placebo and the other two \ngroups were vaccinated with a single dose of V A-MEN -\nGOC-BC\u00ae stored at 4 to 8 \u00b0C for either 24 or 36 months \n(Lots 0021 and 9001-Y , respectively). The vaccine was \nadministered intramuscularly (i.m.) to each animal, in \na total volume of 0.2 mL (0.1 mL on each leg) [10], \non the posterior middle region of the inner side of each \nthigh. The dose was established by extrapolating the al -\nlometric and weight proportions between men and the \nanimal model used as equivalent to the vaccine dosage \nadministered in humans guaranteeing a safety margin. \nThe 0.2 mL volume was the maximum specified for the \nspecies by i.m. route [11]. Animals were vaccinated and \nsingle daily determinations were made in the follow -\ning 14 days attending to: animal weight, water and food \nconsumption and body temperature. Muscle volume in -\ncrease at the inoculation site was also measured during \nthe first 72 h. Animals were euthanized on day 14 for \nanatomopathological studies, to seek for any possible \nvariation in the normal physiology of organs, systems \nand premises related to the administered product.\nHousing conditions\nAnimals were housed on polycarbonate T4 type boxes \n(floor area: 1800 cm2) (Tecniplast, Italy), distributed in five animals of the same sex per box and they were \nindividually identified by ear puncture [12]. Boxes \ncontained bagasse bedding of shredded sugar cane as \nsupplied by CENPALAB (Cuba), previously steril -\nized in autoclave for 25 min at 121 \u00b0C and changed \ntwice a week. Animals were provided with special -\nized rat feed (ALYco\u00ae; supplied and certified by \nCENPALAB, Cuba) and acidulated drinking water \n(pH 2.7-3.0) ad libitum . Boxes were kept under con -\ntrolled conditions at 22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, relative humidity of 60 \n\u00b1 5 % and a light/dark cycle of 12/12 h. \nObservations, clinical symptoms and body \nweight\nThe animals were observed every 12 h since vaccine ad -\nministration. The inoculation site was closely inspect -\ned, and special attention was paid to the appearance or \nmanifestations of lameness, piloerection, prostration, \ninvoluntary movements, ataxia, salivation, tearing, ex -\ncitement, incoordination or any other symptom.\nThe animals were weighed just before the inocu -\nlation and subsequently at weekly intervals (7 and 14 \ndays post-inoculation). Data was recorded individua -\nlly, together with data regarding the group, sex and \ntreatments received.\nWater and food consumption\nThese parameters were evaluated at the start of the \nstudy and every two days. Water consumption was \nmeasured per group of animals as the difference \nbetween the initial water volume placed in the box \nand the remaining volume at the time of collection. \nAn initial volume of 750 mL of water was provided \nper box, measured with a 1000-mL graduated glass \ncylinder (Thomas Scientific, USA). Mean daily con -\nsumption per animal was calculated dividing the \ndifference of water volume between the number of \nanimals in the box and the period from the previous \ndata collection.\nSimilarly, mean daily food consumption per animal \nwas calculated, providing 500 g of ALYco\u00ae rat feed \nper box and measuring the different after the estab -\nlished period. The remaining feed was weighed with a \ntechnical scale (Sartorius, Germany).\nThermometry and muscular diameter\nBody temperature was measured intra-rectally for 1 to \n2 min with the aid of a clinical mercury thermometer \naccording to standard procedures. Determinations \nwere made on 0, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation \nand properly recorded.\nMuscle diameter was assessed with a digital caliper \nwith LCD display (MasterCraf, USA) by two trained \ntechnicians, one restraining the animal and the other \nmaking the measurement. Briefly, the middle region \nof the thigh muscle was taken as reference, followed \nby placing the caliper external jaws on the inner and \nouter faces of the biceps femoral muscle. Then, the \ncaliper was fitted without pressure and readings were \nmade. Measures were taken and recorded 0, 8, 24, 48 \nand 72 h post-inoculation.\nExperimental endpoint euthanasia and ethics\nAnimals were euthanized by administering 100 mg \nsodium thiopental per kg of body weight by i.v. route 3.

The procedure was administered as \nendpoint according to the experimental design of the \nstudy, complying with Morton\u2019s recommendations on \nthe humanitarian endpoint [15]. All the techniques \nand procedures for animal handling and experimenta -\ntion were approved by the Institutional Committee for \nthe Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (CICUAL) at \nthe Finlay Institute of Vaccines.\nAnatomopathological studies\nOnce euthanized the animals on day 14 post-inocu -\nlation, they were immediately subjected to anatomo -\npathological studies comprising the macroscopic in -\nspection of all the organs and the vaccine inoculation \nsite. Samples were taken from all the anatomic loca -\ntions where alterations were detected. \nTissue samples were processed by fixation in 10 % \nformaldehyde neutralized with calcium carbonate for \nthe first 24 h. Then, fixative concentration was reduced \nto 4 % until its embedding in paraffin. Sections of 4-6 \n\u03bcm thickness were taken with the aid of a Histolide \n2000 microtome (Leica Biosystems, Germany), and \ntheir direction and number were according to WHO \nrecommendations for the evaluation of toxic products \n[4, 6]. Tissue slices were stained with an hematoxilin-\neosin mix and subjected to microscopic observations \nwith conventional Leyca and Olympus microscopes \n(DMLB and CH-2, models respectively; Olympus, \nJapan).\nStatistical analysis\nThe animals\u2019 variables subjected to statistical inter -\npretation were: body weight, mean water and food \nconsumption, body temperature, muscular diameter \nand histopathological findings. Data was expressed as \ncentral tendency values with dispersion (means plus/\nless standard deviation, lower and upper values). Sta -\ntistical differences were set for p \u2264 0.05.\nNormality assumptions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov \nand Shapiro-Wilk tests) and homogeneity of vari -\nances (Levene test) were verified for each sex. When \nsatisfied, a parametric analysis of variance (ANOV A) \nwas applied. If they did not meet these criteria, the \nnonparametric alternative was used (Kruskal Wal -\nlis test). When necessary, paired comparisons were \nmade in consecutive time intervals, using the paired \nt-test or the Wilcoxon test depending on the fulfill -\nment of the approximation assumption for a normal \ndistribution. For those cases showing global differ -\nences between groups, the LSD multiple compari -\nson test or the Dunn\u2019s test were applied, according \nto compliance with distributional assumptions. Data \nresulting from the histopathological study were ana -\nlyzed through the construction of the cross-classifi -\ncation tables, with the associated independence test \n(Fisher\u2019s exact test).\nResults and discussion\nThe rat species is the animal model of choice for non-\nclinical vaccine toxicity evaluations, and the Sprague-\nDawley strain has been widely used due to its high \nsensitivity [10, 16, 17]. It is also a non-isogenic strain, 13. Committee for the Update of the \nGuide for the Care and Use of Labora -\ntory Animals. Guide for the care and use \nof laboratory animals.

Particularly the SD \nrat model is regarded as relevant for the evaluation \nof the intrinsic toxicity and that associated to the im -\nmune response of vaccine products against N. menin -\ngitidis . These are the reasons why it was selected to \ntest the toxicity of the V A-MENGOC-BC\u00ae vaccine \nintended to extend its shelf-life from 24 to 36 months.  \nObservations, clinical symptoms and body weight\nDuring the study, no clinical symptoms were shown \nand not any animal died. All the animals gained weight \nduring the 14 days post-inoculation (Figure 1), with no \nsignificant differences detected between treatments as \ncompared to the control group (p \u2265 0.05). Male rats \ngained weight faster than females (p \u2264 0.05), and weight \ngain curves were in agreement with those previously \nobserved in other experiments, run in our facilities or \neven reported in the scientific literature [9, 12-16].\nWater and food consumption\nWater and food consumption were similar among \nevaluated groups (p \u2265 0.05), either receiving treat -\nments or placebo. Males consumed more water \nand food than females (24.5 g of food and 38.1 mL \nof water for males vs. 17.9 g and 27 mL females)  \n(Table 1). Mean values were as reported in the litera -\nture and consistent with historical records for SD rats \nin our facilities [7-9, 18, 19]. Nevertheless, significant \ndifferences (p \u2264 0.05) were observed in female rats for \nwater consumption between groups immunized with \nV A-MENGOC-BC\u00ae lots 0021 and 9001-Y (stored at \n0250\n200\n150\n100\n50350\n300\n0 7 14 0 7 14Body weight (g)\nTime (days)\nFigure 1.

In both cases, consump -\ntion was higher in females from the group receiving the \nvaccine lot 0021. However, these differences were irrel -\nevant from the physiological and toxicological points \nof view, due to the similarity of weight gain among all \nthe groups and the absence of clinical symptoms. At the \nsame time, the differences seen in female animals im -\nmunized with vaccine lot 0021 could be related with \na mild fever detected on them at 8 h post-inoculation.\nThermometry and muscular diameter\nThe physiological range of body temperature reported \nfor the rat species is 37.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00baC [20]. As shown in \nfigure 2, during the first 8 h there was a slight increase \nin the mean body temperature in female rats vaccinated \nwith either vaccine lot. Despite average ranges were \nbelow 38 \u00baC, significant differences were found in fe -\nmale rats between for the group receiving the vaccine \nlot 0021 (37.97 \u00baC) as compared to placebo (37.43 \u00baC). \nIn that vaccine group, four out of ten animals had a mild \nfever (38.1-38.5 \u00baC), at 8 h post inoculation, which was \ntransient and subsequently disappeared. This could be \nrelated to the increased water and food consumption \nseen in these animals from 8 to 24 h post-inoculation, to \nrecover from the lower consumption rate experimented \nduring the first 8 h when mild fever occurred. Moreover, \nthese parameters were measured every two days. In \nfact, such effects are well documented in the literature \nas related to febrile states [21]. Female rats receiving \nvaccine lot 9001-Y (36 months) showed no significant \ndifferences in respect to females of the other two groups. \nTemperature values at 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation \nwere similar (p \u2265 0.05) within physiological ranges.\nDuring the experiment, all the experimental tempe -\nrature evaluations made on male animals showed mean \ntemperature values similar among groups (p \u2265 0.05).\nImportantly, body temperature is determinant for \nreactogenicity evaluations of vaccine products during \nclinical trials. In those studies, expected and unexpected \nadverse events are closely monitored, including: fever, \nheadache, pain at the vaccine administration site, red -\nness, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, among \nothers [22, 23]. In this sense, thermometry assessment \nin preclinical toxicological studies can contribute to pre -\ndict the potential reactogenicity in humans of a given \nvaccine. Considering this, the results obtained were re -\ngarded as satisfactory, with no fever detected in vacci -\nne animals after 8 h post-inoculation, and in agreement \nwith all the other evaluations as evidencing the low re -\nactogenicity of the vaccine tested. They also extended \nthe safety profile of the V A-MENGOC-BC\u00ae vaccine.\nAdditionally, the assessment of muscular diameter \nhelps to determine the occurrence of any inflammatory \nprocess at the vaccine administration site [24]. This \nparameter showed significant differences (p \u2264 0.05) in \nvaccinated animals as compared to the control group \nat 24 and 48 h, with no significant differences detected \nbetween vaccine groups (Table 2). Such an effect was \nas expected in vaccinated animals due to the alumi -\nnum hydroxide present in the formulation as vaccine \nadjuvant, together with the effect of the immune res -\nponse against vaccine antigens [13, 25]. Furthermore, \nmuscle diameter peaked at 24 h post-inoculation, with a progression to normal values from 48 h onwards. \nThese was indicative and complemented the low re -\nactogenicity profile of the vaccine, together with the \nlack of lameness, pain or any other gait dysfunction.\nAnatomopathological studies\nDuring necropsies, macroscopic observations were \ndetected at the inoculation site in vaccinated animals. \nThey were consistent with granulomatous processes in \nboth vaccinated groups (Table 3; Figure 3).

Single dose toxicity of VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae at 36 months3215\nBiotecnolog\u00eda Aplicada 2018; Vol.35, No.3inoculated with vaccine products containing aluminum \nphosphate or hydroxide as adjuvant [7, 9, 25]. More -\nover, adenitis was present in the popliteal and deep \ninguinal lymph nodes, possibly related to the immune \nresponse activated by the immunogens through the ef -\nferent lymph circulation to those ganglia [26]. These \neffects have been previously reported [7, 9, 25]. No \nother alterations or macroscopic lesions were found in \nother organs or organs systems in the animals.\nThe diagnosed microscopic lesions identified as \npossible granulomatous processes at the inoculation \nsite were further verified microscopically. Significant \ndifferences were found as compared to the inocu -\nlation site in the control group (p \u2264 0.05; Table 4). \nThese findings were consistent with observations in \nsimilar previous studies carried out in this species and \nwhen administering aluminum hydroxide-containing \nvaccines as V A-MENGOC-BC\u00ae [9, 25]. Moreover, \nthe findings in the efferent regional lymph nodes co -\nrresponding to the vaccine inoculation site have been \nregarded as unspecific by other research groups [9, \n26]. Despite such considerations, and attending to the \nsignificant differences (p \u2264 0.05) observed in vaccina -\nted male rats as compared to the control group in the \nnumber of secondary lymphoid follicles in ganglia, it \nwas considered that this effect was related to immuno -\nlogical response against the vaccine.\nConclusions\nIn summary, the V A-MENGOC-BC\u00ae vaccine stored \nat 4-8 \u00b0C for 36 months showed a similar safety profile \nin SD rats as that of the vaccine stored for 24 months \nunder the same conditions. Neither local nor systemic \nadverse toxic effects were detected when a single dose \nof the vaccine was i.m. administered. This indicates \nthat the vaccine stored for 36 months can be consid -\nered as potentially non-toxic and supports the possible \nextension of V A-MENGOC-BC\u00ae vaccine shelf life \nup to 36 months under these storage conditions.\n5\n1243A B C\nFigure 3.
