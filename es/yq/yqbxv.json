Check out these non-toxic options to keep your pets safe!", "sitename": "Platt Hill Nursery", "date": "2021-01-25", "id": null, "license": null, "body": null, "comments": "", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "Sometimes\n[plantas de interior](https://platthillnursery.com/es/safe-holiday-houseplants-chicago/) can be a tempting snack for a pet. A dog or [cat might nibble](https://platthillnursery.com/es/diy-catnip-planter-project-for-beginners/) on plants to remedy an upset stomach, make up for a nutrient deficiency, or they might just be feeling playful. With that said, many houseplants are toxic and should be kept out of reach of [toddlers](https://platthillnursery.com/es/turn-your-clay-pots-into-works-of-art/) and animals. But fortunately, many are safe for pets and won\u2019t cause harm if they attempt to sample them. Here are a few great options that have been approved as non-toxic by the [ASPCA](https://www.aspca.org/) (American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals):\nWhen a plant itself becomes a playmate, a pet-safe option can prevent an accident from occurring.\nAfrican Violet\nA beautiful small flower for coffee tables or desks, African violets grow velvety leaves and bloom in many shades of purple and white. They are an attractive low-light plant, and while these natives of eastern Africa aren\u2019t edible, they\u2019re not toxic either.\nHelecho de Boston\nThis certainly may appear to be a tasty treat for a cat, perhaps for the same reasons that we enjoy them\u2014for their lush fronds and bushy greenery! Many ferns are toxic, but fortunately, this one is safe. It will do well with moist soil, lots of humidity, and bright, filtered light.\nCalathea\nLa\n[peacock plant](https://platthillnursery.com/es/a-complete-guide-to-growing-calatheas-chicago/), or [Calathea](https://platthillnursery.com/es/a-complete-guide-to-growing-calatheas-chicago/) makoyana, can add lively color to a room. With leaves as beautiful as these, you might expect to find a toxic compound or two. But these natives of the South American jungles are safe for pets and ideal for low-light conditions!\nPlanta ara\u00f1a o Mala madre\nOne of the most resilient houseplants available, the spider plant grows thick, grass-like leaves that flow over the edge of a pot. They\u2019re ideal for\n[hanging baskets](https://platthillnursery.com/es/perfect-houseplants-for-hanging-baskets/) or any place you need a splash of greenery. They grow at a quick rate, tolerate both low and bright light, and are safe for pets. Plus, they\u2019re one of NASA\u2019s top-rated [air-purifying plants](https://platthillnursery.com/es/breathe-easier-with-these-air-purifying-houseplants/)!\nPalmera cola de caballo\nMost cats could hardly resist a passing swipe at these breezy leaves, but this succulent won\u2019t do them any harm. To keep it flourishing, place it anywhere it will receive bright light and keep the soil on the dry side.\nL\u00e1grimas de beb\u00e9\nThis\n[trailing houseplant](https://platthillnursery.com/es/perfect-houseplants-for-hanging-baskets/) is safe for pets. It\u2019s named for its beautiful tear-shaped leaves that spill over the edge of a pot. Keep yours in high humidity and bright, filtered sunlight, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with abundant foliage.\nPrayer Plant\nThe prayer plant, or Maranta leuconeura, is known for its striking leaves with thin pink stripes. A non-toxic plant from the Brazilian tropics, it prefers bright, indirect light but tolerates low light conditions. At night, it folds its leaves together like two hands in prayer.\nAreca Palm\nThis\n[popular houseplant](https://platthillnursery.com/es/plantas-de-interior-mas-atractivas-del-2021/) can easily fill out any corner or floor space, as long as it receives bright filtered light. It adds such a relaxing feel to a space that you soon won\u2019t recognize your room without it. Better yet, all of its abundant greenery is safe for pets.\nHaworthia\nThis classic succulent has all the charm of an aloe vera but without the toxicity. You can enjoy its beautiful green or red leaves on any table or desk that\u2019s within reach of a pet. Plus, it\u2019s easy to care for, only requiring water once the soil has dried out, and it happily tolerates dry air.\nel Cactus de Navidad,\nAnother lover of dry conditions, the\n[Christmas cactus](https://platthillnursery.com/es/christmas-cactus-care-and-blooms/) has charming fronds of plump leaves and blooms with pink or red flowers in December. This is another non-toxic option for all of you succulent lovers out there!\nAnimals often enjoy houseplants as much as we do\u2014the soil may host an insect to play with or become a favorite hiding spot during playtime!
