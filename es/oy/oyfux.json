Many experimental ADCs, however, failed due to the complexity of pairing the right antibody with the appropriate toxic agent. Some were abandoned as too weak; others were too harmful.\nFrom 2000 to 2018, only five ADCs won approval. Just one, Roche\u2019s Kadcyla, approved in 2013 for breast cancer, has surpassed $1 billion in annual sales after data last year showed it boosted disease-free survival for some patients compared with the standard treatment, Roche\u2019s Herceptin.\nOver time, however, scientists devised better ways to connect payloads and antibodies and more precisely reach tumours. There is a growing understanding, too, of how to design ADCs to kill even surrounding cancer cells that previously evaded destruction.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now are the benefits of the science becoming mature,\u201d said ADC pioneer Chris Martin, CEO of Switzerland\u2019s ADC Therapeutics. \u201cIt took at least a decade, probably more like 15 years, to really begin to turn the art into a science.\u201d\nIn 2019, U.S. regulators approved three ADCs, the most ever in a single year, as last-ditch treatments based on studies showing they helped patients whose survival outlook was bleak.\nThey include AstraZeneca\u2019s and Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s breast cancer drug, Enhertu, which was shown to help patients who had failed numerous previous treatments survive a median of more than 16 months before their disease worsened.\nAstellas\u2019 and Seattle Genetics\u2019 bladder cancer drug, Padcev, also received expedited approval in December, based on evidence that 44% of patients who had failed immunotherapy showed improvement, and in some cases, no evidence of cancer, when they were assessed after treatment.\nRoche\u2019s Polivy was green-lighted against lymphoma in June after producing complete response rates, with no signs of disease, in 40% of patients when combined with two other therapies.\nNEW RECORD\nWhile all three drugs must prove their mettle in further studies, the industry is growing optimistic that ADCs\u2019 time may have arrived.\nThe number of ADC drug candidates is at unprecedented levels, according to data from consultancy Beacon Targeted Therapies compiled for Reuters, based on a review of companies\u2019 pipelines. Dozens more ADC prospects are in pre-clinical review.\nLondon-based Beacon advises drugmakers on targeted therapies, helping them decide whether to pursue prospective drugs or redirect efforts, based on industry trends.\nCurrent ADC projects include GlaxoSmithKline testing its belantamab mafodotin against multiple myeloma.\nADC Therapeutics, part-owned by private equity firm Auven Therapeutics, has several studies on experimental drugs, including with Danish partner Genmab, on blood cancers and solid tumours.\nU.S. biotech Immunomedics\u2019 market capitalization gained more than 60% to $4.3 billion in the last six months, ahead of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s late-December decision to review its ADC against triple-negative breast cancer, which is hard to treat and has poor prognosis.\nMassachusetts-based ImmunoGen, hit by past trial failures, got a lift in December for its ADC against ovarian cancer when the FDA indicated it may become a candidate for accelerated approval.\nThe surge in ADC investment has been fuelled, in part, by improvements in the so-called \u201clinker\u201d technology that binds the antibody to its cancer-killing toxins, keeping them stable in the circulatory system until the poison can be unleashed on the targeted tumour.\nADCs are generally delivered via repeated infusions, similar to chemotherapy.\n\u201cThere is a revival again because there is a new generation of molecules in which the linker is more efficient,\u201d Giuseppe Curigliano, clinical director of early drug development at Milan\u2019s European Institute of Oncology, told Reuters.\nBETTING ON GROWTH\nThis optimism has contract manufacturers like Merck KGaA and Lonza ramping up facilities, in hopes drugmakers will farm out complex ADC production.\nMerck expects the overall ADC market to grow by more than 20% in coming years, boosting its business, which includes manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies, linkers and cytotoxic agents.\nRival Lonza, which helps make Roche\u2019s two ADCs and sees annual 9% growth for the so-called bioconjugates market, is investing millions of dollars in its Swiss site, where it produces ADCs for other drugmakers.\n\u201cWhat we see over time at Lonza is a good request for capacity,\u201d said Iwan Bertholjotti, Lonza\u2019s bioconjugate commercial development head. \u201cThat\u2019s a good sign that the market is booming.\u201d\n(GRAPHIC: Global ADC clinical pipeline - )\n(GRAPHIC: ADC clinical development - )\nStill, enthusiasm is not universal.\nAbbVie in August abandoned its ADC candidate Rova-T after flunking a lung cancer trial and wrote off most of the $5.8 billion it paid for the drug\u2019s developer, Stemcentrx, in 2016.\nRoche, which helped pioneer ADCs with Kadcyla and Polivy, has also backed off. In 2013, the Basel-based company had about a dozen experimental ADCs. Today, only one remains, and it is being developed for Staph infections, not cancer.\n\u201cWe have shifted our technology priorities,\u201d Roche CEO Severin Schwan told Reuters. \u201cMaybe others will be luckier, but we failed to master the complexity.\u201d\nAstraZeneca aims to do just that.\nIn March, the Cambridge, England-based drugmaker struck a $7 billion deal with Japan\u2019s Daiichi Sankyo for rights to Enhertu, getting $1.35 billion up-front, and more if it challenges Roche drugs\u2019 dominance in breast cancer.\nSome industry analysts see Enhertu sales eventually reaching up to $7 billion annually.\n\u201cOur plan is to expand the number of studies in different tumour types,\u201d said Gilles Gallant, head of oncology R&D at Daiichi Sankyo. \u201cThis agent has potential.\u201d\nReporting by Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt and John Miller in Zurich; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Dan Grebler\n\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306e\u884c\u52d5\u898f\u7bc4\uff1a\n[\u30c8\u30e0\u30bd\u30f3\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u300c\u4fe1\u983c\u306e\u539f\u5247\u300d](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)", "language": null, "image": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200106&t=2&i=1472885985&r=LYNXMPEG050S2&w=800", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/global-gateway.html", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/login.html", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216467423-Contact-Reuters", "https://reuters.zendesk.com/hc/en-us", "https://jp.reuters.com/news/archive/worldNews", "https://jp.reuters.com/journalists/ludwig-burger", "https://jp.reuters.com/journalists/john-miller", "https://jp.reuters.com/article/uk-cancer-adc-explainer/explainer-making-a-new-generation-of-guided-missile-cancer-drugs-work-idUKKBN1Z511K", "https://jp.reuters.com/article/uk-cancer-adc-explainer/explainer-making-a-new-generation-of-guided-missile-cancer-drugs-work-idUKKBN1Z511K", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "//jp.reuters.com/tools/mobile", "http://newslink.jp.reuters.com/join/subscribe", "//2290722.polldaddy.com/s/reuters-contactus", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html#cookies", "//jp.reuters.com/info/terms", "//jp.reuters.com/info/privacy", "javascript:window.OneTrust.ToggleInfoDisplay();", "https://jp.reuters.com/info/copyright"]}
